  School went by in a dazed blur for the girls. 
The senshi collectively decided to train in a 
remote area near Makoto&#39;s. 
  Mina and Ami had moved in with Mako before 
summer&#39;s end, so it was the most convenient 
location now for meetings, training, and music 
practice. The outer senshi were also closer to 
Mako&#39;s. The jinja was the farthest away, because 
it was in the foothills.
  The two came home to the jinja just long 
enough to grab a bite to eat, change into 
athletic shorts and tank tops. They put their 
hair up and brought their music equipment down 
the colorful tree-lined steps to the beautifully 
manicured grove at the bottom. Rei had a private 
car garage built there for the senshi&#39;s 
vehicles, and it was where Usagi&#39;s electric-blue 
Subaru waited. It was effectively a two-seater 
with the back seats folded down.
  Usagi carefully packed Rei&#39;s digital Yamaha 
piano, her own main three guitars, and the 
&#39;traveling rig&#39; into the small WRX wagon. 
  Rei just sat and waited in the left front 
passenger&#39;s seat. Only Usagi packed her car, or 
touched her gear. She had just told Rei in no 
uncertain terms to &#39;live with it&#39;. They would 
have a &#39;good jam&#39; today... Usagi was inspired. 
Rei was annoyed and impatient. She hadn&#39;t wanted 
to practice their music ensemble at all. She 
wanted... something else, but acquiesced to 
Usagi&#39;s wishes. 
  At one point along the way, Usagi&#39;s chatter 
stopped. Something seemed to have caught her 
attention on the radio. She hummed a few bars of 
something totally unrelated, and strummed her 
steering wheel. Rei thought she was about to 
close her eyes, but instead she gasped. 
  &quot;Ooh yeah, that&#39;s a wicked good sound! Gotta 
record that... Rei, hold the wheel!&quot; 
  Usagi scribbled something in a journal that 
she always seemed to have. She probably kept it 
in her sub-space pocket. 
  Rei giggled out loud. 
  &quot;Thanks, Rei. I am so psyched! This will be 
perfect.&quot; Usagi positively vibrated by time they 
arrived. 
  Rei was frazzled.
  Rei waited patiently while Usagi propped her 
hard cases up in a row against the side of blue 
car, then took out her amp, a mixer, and then a 
big equipment bag. She finally got to Rei&#39;s 
piano on the bottom and carefully lifted it out 
for Rei. 
  Usagi shut the back of the car and smiled at 
Rei.
  &quot;Oh no! I refuse to carry that amp! Don&#39;t look 
at me like that... I&#39;ll carry the mixer or the 
gear bag.&quot; 
  Usagi promptly handed Rei the large leather 
bag stuffed with foot switches, mikes, cables, 
guitar stands, and other essentials. 
  Rei glared at her. 
  &quot;Usagi, this weighs a ton now! What else did 
you put in here?&quot; 
  So Usagi handed her the amp. 
  Rei rolled her eyes and grumbled. 
  &quot;Oh, fine! Don&#39;t expect anything from me 
later, I&#39;ll be too tired and sore.&quot;
  Usagi smiled sweetly. 
  &quot;You don&#39;t have to do anything! I&#39;ll make you 
feel so good, you&#39;ll forget all about how tired 
or sore you are. I&#39;ll even throw in a massage 
with scented oil.&quot; 
  Usagi said happily and launched into her own 
rendition of &#39;Tonight&#39;s the Night&#39; by Rod 
Stewart. 
  All the senshi were proficient in English, due 
mostly to Mina&#39;s tutelage and periodical foreign 
exchange students from English-speaking 
countries. All of them owned American CDs.
  Usagi sang lustily.
  &quot;...Spread your wings and let me...&quot;
  Rei interrupted her.
  &quot;Shhh! Stop it, Usagi, you&#39;re embarrassing 
me!&quot; Rei hissed. Her face was aflame, not to 
mention a growing itch in her pelvis.
  Usagi pulled out her communicator and signaled 
Makoto. 
  &quot;Hey, girlfriend! We&#39;re here, could you guys 
come down and give us a hand with our gear 
before Rei has kittens? ...Thanks!&quot; 
  Rei stuck her tongue out at Usagi. 
  Usagi rocked her hips at her with a grin.
  &quot;Oooh, you are impossible!&quot; Rei finally 
laughed. 
  About that time the rest of the girls 
descended on them with big hugs and began to 
grab Usagi&#39;s equipment.
  &quot;Whoa, easy does it, this stuff means a lot to 
me!&quot; Usagi begged.
  Makoto carried the amplifier and the equipment 
bag. Rei carried the power mixer and her piano. 
Usagi carried her Fender, Mina had the Gibson, 
and Ami the Takamine.
  When Usagi was content her equipment made it 
inside safely, she asked Makoto if she had any 
word on where the outers were. Mako told her 
Haruka had called to say they would be a bit 
late. 
  About that time, there was a knock at the 
door, and Makoto opened her door to welcome 
Michiru and Haruka.
  Haruka grinned at Makoto. 
  &quot;Oooh, something smells really good! Can we 
stay for dinner?&quot;
  &quot;Sure, if you&#39;re still alive after I kick your 
butt in combat. Kendo, Judo, Aikido, Jujitsu, 
you pick.&quot; Makoto said menacingly.
  &quot;Oh goody, another smart-aleck who thinks they 
can take me on, Michiru! And she&#39;ll even throw a 
pot roast in to sweeten the deal.&quot; 
  Haruka made a beeline to where Usagi set up 
her equipment alone. 
  &quot;What&#39;s the matter, kitten, did everyone 
abandon you?&quot; Haruka kissed her, &quot;I&#39;m glad you 
feel better. Are you sure you&#39;re up for full 
contact senshi training and music practice?&quot;
  Usagi nodded. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll be ok. If I get too tired and start to 
make a lot of mistakes, I&#39;ll stop. Did you bring 
your Washburn? I brought some extra cables for 
you. Have you practiced what I taught you, and 
have you tried some experimentation to have a 
little fun?&quot;
  Haruka smiled broadly. 
  &quot;You bet. I looove my eight string bass! I&#39;ll 
knock your sox off with my stuff. Thank you so 
much for your help to broaden my horizons! I 
don&#39;t know what Rei&#39;s problem is... she doesn&#39;t 
know what she&#39;s missed. I&#39;m glad you picked me 
to teach when she refused! I still have to keep 
up my piano practice for Michi, though. You are 
both such task masters.&quot;
  Usagi saddened and said quietly. 
  &quot;Rei is... aware of what she&#39;s missed, and is 
content with her piano, the same way I am with 
my choice of instrument, or the way Michi loves 
her violin, or Ami her harp, or the way Mina 
prefers to just sing. I love that you are 
prepared to be so versatile, but I also love my 
other friends the way they are. There&#39;s nothing 
wrong with them. You were just ready for a 
change.&quot;
  Haruka blushed slightly. 
  &quot;I stand corrected, Sensei Odango. Here, let 
me help you with that. Where do you want it?&quot; 
Haruka asked her friend. 
  Usagi pointed across the room away from Mako&#39;s 
drums set. 
  &quot;You just got over a major illness and you are 
already pushing yourself too hard.&quot; 
  Haruka remarked pointedly and moved the amp 
over to where Usagi had indicated. 
  Usagi carried her small audio mixer over and 
hooked up cables.
  &quot;I know. I think we&#39;re ready to go here now.&quot; 
Usagi looked up at a six-foot Haruka gratefully. 
  &quot;It&#39;s just we&#39;ve lost so much time while I was 
sick. I&#39;m so far behind in everything!&quot;
  &quot;We can&#39;t risk for you to get sick again, 
Usagi, so take a chill pill.&quot; 
  Haruka hugged her kitten, and that&#39;s what Rei 
saw when she walked in to see if Usagi needed 
any assistance with hook-ups or arrangements. 
  Rei gave them a curious look.
  Usagi smiled at her. 
  &quot;It&#39;s too late to help now, everything is 
finished, thanks to Haruka. She was the only one 
who wanted to save me from myself.&quot;
  Rei made a wry face. 
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I was yakking and not thinking. 
Obviously, someone like me needs to keep an eye 
on you two, instead.&quot; 
  They both looked sheepish. 
  Rei laughed at their public humiliation.

                   * * *           
  Usagi walked Rei out and surreptitiously 
squeezed her hand to let her know that there 
were no worries. Rei squeezed back.
  All the senshi decided on hand-to-hand combat, 
Judo or Aikido, and paired up this way:
  Haruka - Makoto
  Rei - Minako
  Usagi - Michiru
  Ami - Mamoru
  Everyone fought without incident for a while. 
Included as part of training was a requirement 
not to lose your temper, or to lose your 
concentration by distractions. 
  This was what was beginning to happen with 
Mina. 
  Rei pelted Mina with shot after shot, and Mina 
hadn&#39;t touched her opponent.
  Rei stopped and relaxed into her ready stance. 
  &quot;Mina, stop. Breathe deeply for a moment and 
empty your mind. Close your eyes and feel my 
Ki.&quot; Rei stood near Mina, &quot;now, keep your eyes 
closed and stop my hand.&quot; Rei directed, and took 
a short controlled punch at her. 
  Mina stopped it, smiled, and opened her eyes. 
Then she nailed Rei in the gut with a knee.
  &quot;Never underestimate your opponent!&quot; Mina said 
and gripped, Rei&#39;s fist hard. 
  Rei took a step back and shifted her weight, 
and caused Mina to shift forward. Rei used 
Mina&#39;s own weight to throw her over her own 
shoulder. 
  Mina tucked and rolled, while Rei waited into 
a relaxed position. Mina came up with a kick to 
the head, but Rei caught her foot and came 
around Mina&#39;s other leg with a leg sweep of her 
own. Mina was on her backside before she could 
blink. Rei stepped back and waited in her 
relaxed stance.
  Rei could feel Usagi and Michiru behind her. 
  Mina moved fast at Rei then sprung high in the 
air. Rei expected and waited for a double kick, 
moved sideways, and leaned backwards slightly. 
  When she did, she noticed it was Usagi&#39;s head 
Mina&#39;s feet were about to make contact with. Rei 
tried valiantly to deflect Mina&#39;s kick with a 
kick of her own, but the force powered by Mina&#39;s 
rage was so potent, she was only able to knock 
one foot away and deflect the other from the 
target.
  Usagi felt something come from behind and 
tried to drop, but the movement caused Michiru&#39;s 
foot to land hard in her solar plexus at the 
precise instant Mina&#39;s other foot landed on the 
back of her head. Usagi landed in a motionless 
heap. She was not breathing. 
  Rei had known by the exertion it took to 
deflect Mina&#39;s attack, someone would have been 
killed had it landed with the full impact, and 
she was afraid for Usagi.
  Rei dropped to her knees and checked to see if 
her friend&#39;s neck was broken, checked for a 
pulse, then tilted Usagi&#39;s head back and started 
to breathe for her. 
  Ami was the second one there because everyone 
let her be. She used her computer to scan 
Usagi&#39;s bio functions and brain waves. Ami 
heaved a sigh of relieve and said Usagi was 
extremely lucky. Rei had redirected enough of 
the attack so that it caused a minimal amount of 
damage. Usagi had a concussion, and other than a 
lump and a huge headache, she would probably be 
all right... as soon as her solar plexus stopped 
its spasms.
  Usagi came to with a gasp. She lay on her 
back, and Rei was on her knees crouched over 
her. Usagi&#39;s eyes blurred and she was overcome 
by nausea. 
  Rei quickly rolled Usagi onto her side towards 
herself as her friend began to retch. Usagi&#39;s 
stomach lay against Rei&#39;s lap as she cradled 
Usagi&#39;s head away from onlookers.
  Mina stood frozen through it all. 
  Rei looked up at Mina, her quiet voice sounded 
like a death knell. 
  &quot;Mina, I think we need to talk. If there is a 
reason you want me dead, I&#39;d like to know about 
it. If not, you need to do something about your 
anger.&quot;
  Tears streaked down Mina&#39;s face. 
  &quot;Hai, Rei-san, we need to talk. I lost my cool 
and it was juvenile. It won&#39;t happen again.&quot; 
  All eyes were on their senshi leader, fingers 
on henshin pens. Mina looked at all of them 
squarely and addressed Haruka. 
  &quot;Haruka, I want you to take over as senshi 
leader until I figure out how to fight what I&#39;m 
infected with. I&#39;m... not myself. I apologize to 
everyone, but especially to Rei and Usagi. You 
can finish this session without me today. I need 
to go home and try to make some sense out of 
this.&quot; 
  Everyone stared in shock as Mina&#39;s figure 
retreated. Mina went back to her room and locked 
the door.
  Usagi sat up shakily and held her head. 
  &quot;What happened? I was fighting Michiru and I 
suddenly couldn&#39;t breathe then everything went 
black. Ooh my head hurts, and I feel sick!&quot;
  Michiru smiled weakly. 
  &quot;You had me whipped, and then I guess I 
finally got a lucky shot in. I didn&#39;t mean to 
hit you so hard. You head sort of got in the 
way, too.&quot;
  Usagi smiled. 
  &quot;It&#39;s all right, Michi, that&#39;s why we train. I 
guess I need to work on my concentration more. 
I&#39;m not the ninja I thought I was!&quot; 
  Usagi then turned to Rei. 
  &quot;Would you mind driving me home, Rei, I 
suddenly feel that music practice and my 
headache are a bad combination. 
  Mako, may I leave my set-up at your house and 
try again tomorrow? I think I may have bitten 
off more than I can chew today, anyway.&quot;
  Rei glanced over to Makoto who still looked 
shocked. She stood and waved a hand in front of 
Mako&#39;s dazed face. 
  &quot;Yo, Cuisine Queen, wakey-wakey. May we leave 
our equipment at your house and practice 
tomorrow? And while I help Usa to her car, do 
you think you could fetch our purses?&quot;
  Makoto blinked. 
  &quot;Certainly, Pyro! Is there anything else you 
need? Usagi?&quot; 
  They both shook their heads &#39;no&#39;.
  Makoto was off like a shot, the others 
followed in her wake. 
  Rei helped Usagi as she got unsteadily to her 
feet then stood and leaned heavily on Rei. They 
walked slowly to the WRX. By the time they 
arrived at the car, Ami and Mako were already 
there. 
  Ami held the car door open for Usagi and put 
their belongings on the floor in the back. 
  Mako had made a &#39;care package&#39; of food for 
them and laid it next to the purses. She 
explained that she had missed their company, and 
had planned for the two of them to stay for 
dinner.
  Ami handed Usagi some medicine for her 
headache and a sports drink. 
  Usagi thanked them both for their kindness 
while Rei slid gleefully into the cockpit.
  Usagi fought nausea all the way home. 
  Meanwhile, Rei celebrated her momentous 
occasion for a chance to drive Usagi&#39;s 
&#39;hot rod&#39;. She got to each speed limit very, 
very quickly and enjoyed its responsiveness a 
little too much, especially around corners. 
Turbo charged cars with stick shifts were boss!
  Rei glanced over at Usagi and noticed her 
pasty complexion, tightly closed eyes, and 
tight, thin, pale lips. She looked as though she 
were in real pain and, extremely nauseated. Rei 
felt a slight twinge of guilt, and reached 
across to caress Usagi&#39;s bare right thigh. 
  &quot;Oops, I&#39;m sorry, sweetheart. We&#39;re almost 
there.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s gray lips pulled back into a semblance 
of a smile. 
  &quot;&#39;Sookay... I really need to let you out of 
your cage more often.&quot; 
  Rei drove more sedately after that.
  When they arrived home, Rei commented on 
Makoto&#39;s generosity. 
  &quot;It sure was nice of Mako to share her meal 
with us. There&#39;s enough here to feed a small 
army, so I hope you&#39;re hungry.&quot;
  Usagi scrambled out of her car, retched, and 
stumbled to her knees. She held her head with 
one hand and her stomach with the other. 
  Rei noticed the girl&#39;s ashen face, and hoped 
Usagi could avoid sickness. She came around the 
car to see if Usagi needed any help, and put her 
arms around her. 
  &quot;Darling, I can get you to your bed a lot 
quicker if you&#39;ll let me carry you. It&#39;s really 
no problem. I&#39;m sorry I mentioned food.&quot;
  Usagi retched again. Rei&#39;s offer sounded 
awfully tempting. But no matter how generous and 
chivalrous Rei felt, the reality was, the jinja 
was a long way up. 
  &quot;No, I think I can walk, if you&#39;ll help me.&quot; 
  Rei sighed, grabbed both purses, the food, and 
helped a woozy Usagi slooowly into the jinja. 
Stubborn girl!

                   * * *          
  Usagi made her way to her room and wearily 
laid down on her futon. 
  Rei came in shortly with an ice pack for the 
lump that swelled on the back of Usagi&#39;s head. 
She took Usagi&#39;s hair down so the ice could be 
more affective. 
  &quot;Lie on your tummy, Princess. I&#39;m supposed to 
make sure you don&#39;t fall asleep for a while. 
Supper will be ready in about an hour... don&#39;t 
worry, Mako taped instructions to the tin foil, 
although...&quot; she rubbed her chin thoughtfully, 
&quot;I can&#39;t seem to remember if I peeled them off 
before I put the roast in the oven.&quot; 
  Rei smiled brightly.
  &quot;Funny, Rei, very funny. Could you not talk so 
loudly, please?&quot; Usagi begged. 
  Rei repented.
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Angel. I&#39;ll be good now.&quot; Rei 
scratched Usagi&#39;s back soothingly.
  &quot;Rei?&quot; Usagi whispered, after a while.
  &quot;Hmmm?&quot; Rei answered.
  &quot;What really happened? Michiru is a terrible 
liar!&quot; Usagi pressed.
  Rei sighed and answered her softly. 
  &quot;Well, Minako tried so hard to hit me, she 
couldn&#39;t feel me. She eventually got frustrated. 
I tried to help her, and she took a cheap shot 
at me. It was very un-Mina like. I decked her 
and she came at me with hatred in her eyes. I 
leaned away from the attack and noticed her feet 
were aimed for your head. I tried to kick her 
feet out of the way, but was only partially 
successful. 
  As you ducked, Michi&#39;s target for your stomach 
area changed to your solar plexus. Her kick 
pushed you up just far enough for one of Mina&#39;s 
feet to make contact with the back of your head. 
  Mina&#39;s attack would have killed me if I 
weren&#39;t so aware, Usagi. I&#39;m worried about her. 
She handed her role as senshi leader to Haruka 
and left.&quot;
  Usagi looked at her thoughtfully.
  &quot;I&#39;m glad you told me the truth, Rei. I&#39;m sure 
Valka infected all of the inner senshi with a 
small amount of Chaos&#39; energy. I know that 
energy very well, since I fought intimately with 
him in Galaxia&#39;s realm. It has affected each of 
us differently. I think it puts the emotions we 
already harbor into over-drive. It could explain 
why our feelings for one another are so intense, 
Rei. 
  I&#39;m half afraid I may wake up one day, and 
wonder &#39;what was I thinking&#39;. I want our love to 
be real, and not the result of just another 
cockamamie plot from an enemy... even if he is 
cute and sort of on our side because he&#39;s fallen 
for Mina. I already feel as though my life is 
someone&#39;s idea of an insidious fairytale!&quot;
  Rei sympathized. She had felt pretty much the 
same way. 
  &quot;I think, Usa, we both know the love we share 
is as old as Mars in the original Silver 
Millennium. It probably will not change. Our 
souls will always find a way back to each 
other.&quot;
  Usagi&#39;s pensive mood brightened considerably.
  &quot;Oh, Rei, thank you for your insight. You are 
right.&quot; Usagi rolled over and sat up, &quot;let&#39;s go 
eat and then visit our fire room, my beautiful 
jinja mistress.&quot; 
  Usagi had hearts in her eyes, and so did Rei. 
  Rei&#39;s timer went off in the kitchen just then. 
They giggled... timing was everything!
