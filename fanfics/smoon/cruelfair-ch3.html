<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>	Makoto dried her eyes on her sleeve one last time and stood 
unsteadily.  Her voice just a bit shaky, she said, &#147;I need to get 
ready for school.  Gonna be late if I don&#146;t hurry.&#148;
	Before she could walk away, Ami&#146;s hand grabbed Makoto&#146;s wrist.
	&#147;Ami,&#148; said Makoto very quietly without turning around.  &#147;I 
can&#146;t do this right now.  Please.&#148;
	Ami slowly released Makoto&#146;s wrist.  &#147;Do you want me to wait 
for you?&#148;
	&#147;No.  I&#146;ll see you at school.&#148;
	Makoto could feel Ami at her back.  The other girl&#146;s voice 
seemed unnaturally quiet when she said, &#147;You&#146;ve been avoiding us.  
Promise you won&#146;t do that anymore.  We need to talk.&#148;
	&#147;Later.  I promise,&#148; answered Makoto.
	&#147;Will you be at lunch?&#148;
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;I can&#146;t.&#148;
	&#147;Mako-chan&#133;&#148;
	Finally turning to face Ami, Makoto said, &#147;Don&#146;t tell them.  
We&#146;ll talk after school.  Minako has play practice.  Usagi and Rei 
always sneak in to watch.  Meet me in the gym then.&#148;
	Ami nodded her agreement.
	&#147;All right,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;You need to get going or you&#146;ll be 
late, too.&#148;  With that she turned and left Ami standing alone in the 
bathroom.


*            *            *

	Ami was in a slight daze as she hurried to catch up to her 
friends.  Makoto was pregnant, which obviously answered the question 
of what happened with Yuu.  With this new development, that all 
important question seemed so insignificant right now, regardless of 
how closely it was all connected.
	&#147;Hi, Ami!&#148;  Minako&#146;s greeting pulled Ami out of her thoughts.  
&#147;We were just about to give up on you.&#148;
	&#147;I stopped to check on Makoto,&#148; said Ami by way of explanation.
	&#147;Is she feeling better?&#148; asked Usagi.  The blonde then 
grimaced.  &#147;You should have seen it last night.  I swear she turned 
green right before&#133;&#148;
	&#147;Spare us the details, odango,&#148; interrupted Rei.  &#147;How&#146;s she 
doing, Ami?  Is everything okay?&#148;
	The double meaning in Rei&#146;s question was clear to Ami.  She 
answered, hoping but not entirely believing what she was saying.  
&#147;She&#146;s fine.  Everything&#146;s okay, she&#146;s just running a little behind 
this morning.  She said she&#146;d see us at school.&#148;
	Usagi moved so she was in front of her friends.  Walking 
backwards so she could face them, she said, &#147;You know, Mako-chan&#146;s 
been acting funny lately.  I bet she found someone who&#146;s just like 
her old sempai.&#148;
	Ami cringed at Usagi&#146;s words.  She was saved from anyone 
noticing as Usagi tripped, stumbled, and fell on her rear.
	The burst of tears and ear-piercing wail from their would-be 
princess set the girls on autopilot.  Rei set about teasing the 
blonde for her clumsiness while at the same time very carefully 
helping her up.  Minako countered Rei&#146;s teasing with plies of the 
sweets she had hidden in her school bag.  Ami went into doctor mode, 
examining Usagi briefly for any cuts or bruises.
	Ami gingerly turned over Usagi&#146;s palm.  When Usagi saw the 
small scrape there, rather then getting more upset, she grinned.
	&#147;See, Rei,&#148; said the vindicated blonde.  &#147;You were mean and 
called me a baby.  But I really did get hurt, didn&#146;t I, Ami?&#148;
	Ami smiled indulgently.  &#147;Yes, you did.  Does it hurt very 
much?&#148;
	&#147;Yes,&#148; answered Usagi, her eyes getting a bit teary.
	&#147;When we get to school, I&#146;ll bandage it for you if you like.&#148;
	Usagi nodded.  &#147;Thank you, Ami.&#148;
	&#147;Well, this is my stop,&#148; said Rei as they came to her turn-off.  
She handed Usagi the bag she&#146;d been carrying for her since her fall.  
&#147;Here you go, Usagi.  I hope your hand feels better.&#148;
	&#147;Thanks, Rei,&#148; answered Usagi.  As an afterthought she blew a 
raspberry at her friend.
	Rei returned the gesture, then turned to Minako.  With a few 
whispered words of affection and a quick kiss, the two said good-bye 
to each other.


*            *            *

	Minako and Ami were already seated at their usual lunch table 
when Usagi came running up to them.  This in and of itself wouldn&#146;t 
have gotten much of a reaction, both girls being very familiar with 
Usagi&#146;s attitudes about lunch period and food in general.  What did 
get their attention was the worried look on the blonde&#146;s face and 
the lack of food in her hands.
	&#147;Do you know where Mako-chan is?&#148; asked Usagi in a near panic.  
&#147;I checked the nurse&#146;s office as soon as I heard, but the nurse said 
she&#146;d already gone back to class, and I can&#146;t find her anywhere.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s first thought was, ~Oh God, they know.~
	Minako looked at Usagi with a mix of concern and confusion.  
&#147;What happened that she had to go to the nurse&#146;s office?&#148;
	&#147;You mean you haven&#146;t heard?&#148;
	Minako shook her head.
	Usagi leaned in a bit closer to the girls.  &#147;Naru told me 
Mako-chan passed out during phys ed.&#148;
	&#147;Is she all right?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; answered Usagi.  &#147;The nurse only said Makoto 
went back to class, so she must be okay, right?  But I can&#146;t find 
her to make sure.&#148;
	&#147;We should look for her,&#148; said Minako.  &#147;Split up and call in 
when we find her?&#148;
	The other two nodded.  Lunch forgotten, the three girls went 
in search of their friend.  Just as they parted, Ami was certain she 
heard Minako mutter something about this becoming a habit.  



	Ami hurried quietly through the library, checking the aisles 
for Makoto&#146;s familiar form.  There were only so many places the girl 
could have gone in the middle of the day, and they were short on 
time to spend searching.
	Concluding that Makoto wasn&#146;t here, Ami decided to head for 
the cafeteria.  Maybe she&#146;d changed her mind about lunch and had 
gone there looking for her friends.
	The cafeteria was in sight when Ami&#146;s communicator beeped.  
She quickly silenced it and moved someplace private to answer the 
call.
	Minako&#146;s face appeared on the viewscreen.  &#147;I found her, 
guys,&#148; she said. &#147;She&#146;s at the benches by the tennis courts.&#148;
	&#147;Have you talked to her yet?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;No.  I was waiting for you guys to get here.&#148;
	&#147;Be right there,&#148; answered Usagi.  &#147;Don&#146;t let her get away.&#148;
	Communications closed, Ami hurried out of the building.
	When she got to the tennis courts, Minako and Usagi were 
crowded around Makoto.  Usagi was sitting next to her, a hand on her 
forehead.
	&#147;Maybe you have a fever,&#148; Ami heard Usagi say as she got 
closer to them.  &#147;You shouldn&#146;t have come to school today, Mako-chan.  
You&#146;re still sick.&#148;
	Makoto moved Usagi&#146;s hand away from her.  Forcing a smile, she 
said, &#147;I&#146;m not sick, Usagi.  Everything&#146;s fine.&#148;
	&#147;People who are fine don&#146;t pass out in the middle of a soccer 
game,&#148; said Minako.
	&#147;For the millionth time, I didn&#146;t pass out,&#148; said Makoto, her 
frustration with the matter beginning to show.
	&#147;Then what did happen?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;I got a little dizzy is all,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;I was in a 
rush this morning and didn&#146;t have time to eat.  And I didn&#146;t really 
eat yesterday because of how I felt.&#148;
	Usagi grimaced at her memories from the previous night.  &#147;I 
still think you look a little pale.  Maybe you should go home 
early.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;Can&#146;t.  I have a math test seventh 
period.  Besides, we have a meeting tonight, and I really need Ami&#146;s 
help with my trig.&#148;
	Minako looked thoughtful for a moment.  Then she said, &#147;I 
agree with Usagi, believe it or not.  Ami?&#148;
	All three looked to her for an answer.  They would do what she 
suggested, she realized.  As much as she wanted to tell Makoto to go 
home and rest, Ami felt she would miss the opportunity to talk with 
her if she did.  Right now that seemed more important.
	&#147;I think she can make it through the rest of the day,&#148; 
answered Ami after a moment of thought.  &#147;As long as she feels okay 
now and doesn&#146;t push herself too much.&#148;
	Makoto chuckled.  &#147;Not a problem there.  I bet I can even 
catch a nap during Watashi-sensei&#146;s history lecture.&#148;
	The concern was still evident on Usagi&#146;s face.  And while 
Minako didn&#146;t seem at all convinced at Ami&#146;s assessment, she didn&#146;t 
argue about it.  The decision was made, but none of them looked 
comfortable with it.


*            *            *

	Makoto dribbled the basketball a few times as she stood at the 
foul line.  She took aim and threw the ball at the hoop.  She 
frowned as it hit the rim and bounced back to her.
	Footsteps made her pause in her next attempt.  The person 
behind her stood silent as Makoto took a deep breath, then shot the 
ball once again.  This time it bounced off the backboard and rolled 
off to the side.
	Finally, Makoto turned to face Ami.  &#147;My aim&#146;s off,&#148; she said 
with a shrug.
	Ami just stood there silently.
	Makoto sighed and went to sit on the bleachers.  She began to 
speak, and after several seconds, Ami moved to sit beside her.
	&#147;You know,&#148; said Makoto, &#147;I&#146;ve had that test since Sunday.  
I&#146;d get up in the morning and wind up just staring at the box.  I 
kept thinking that if I waited just one more day&#133;&#148;
	She leaned forward, arms resting on her knees, staring at her 
sneakers rather then the girl next to her.  &#147;I don&#146;t know what to 
say to you, Ami.  I don&#146;t know what to say to any of you.&#148;
	&#147;I know about Yuu.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s head snapped around.  Ami looked almost as surprised 
for having said it as she did for having heard it.
	&#147;How?&#148; asked Makoto.
	&#147;I heard him talking with his friends.  He&#146;s in my class, you 
know.&#148;
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;I was hoping no one would find out.&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re not going to be able to hide it forever.  Unless&#133;&#148;
	It took Makoto a second, but when she understood what Ami was 
asking, she said, &#147;No.  Not that.  I don&#146;t think I could live with 
it.&#148;
	&#147;What are you going to do, then?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;Don&#146;t know.  I haven&#146;t really thought that far ahead.  Right 
now I&#146;m just trying to figure out how to tell the others.&#148;
	Ami placed a hand on top of Makoto&#146;s.  &#147;Just tell them.  
They&#146;ll understand.&#148;
	Makoto looked into Ami&#146;s eyes trying to gauge what she was 
seeing without her own emotions getting in the way.  It didn&#146;t 
usually work, but she needed to see Ami&#146;s eyes when she said what 
she was going to next.
	&#147;I didn&#146;t want to be alone,&#148; said Makoto quietly.  &#147;It hasn&#146;t 
been that bad since my parents, and there he was, wanting to be with 
me.  I&#146;d known him for all of three days; it was the only way he&#146;d 
stay.  I knew it was a mistake, but I didn&#146;t want him to leave.  I 
thought if I let him, he would stay just a while longer.  But that&#146;s 
not how it works.  I should have learned that lesson after the first 
time.&#148;
	Makoto looked away from Ami.  There was a difference in the 
girl&#146;s grip on her hands, and she had seen the shift in emotion in 
Ami&#146;s eyes.  She didn&#146;t blame her.
	&#147;Do you understand now?&#148; asked Makoto.  &#147;I can&#146;t tell her 
something like that, and you know she&#146;ll ask.  She was so concerned 
about me earlier and she tried so hard to help me last night.  She&#146;s 
got such a kind heart, always worried about her friends.  She sees 
us as these perfect people who can do no wrong by her.  I can&#146;t bear 
to see the shame and disappointment in her eyes.  It&#146;s bad enough 
seeing it in yours.&#148;
	Just realizing how her grip had tightened on Makoto&#146;s hands, 
Ami let go of the girl.  For a second she hesitated, hand halfway to 
its intended target.  Then she swallowed the worst of her emotions 
and let her fingers rest on Makoto&#146;s cheek.
	Gently turning Makoto to face her, Ami looked back into the 
other girl&#146;s eyes.  &#147;I&#146;m not ashamed of you,&#148; she said quietly.  
&#147;I&#146;m worried about you because I can tell you&#146;re hurting.  I admit I 
was a bit thrown by all of this, but I still feel exactly the same 
about you as I did last week or last year.&#148;  Ami smiled and 
carefully wiped away the tear that was running down Makoto&#146;s cheek.  
&#147;The others will feel the same way, Mako-chan.&#148;
	For just this once, Makoto decided to let down the wall that 
kept out all her dreams and fantasies.  She heard in Ami&#146;s voice and 
words what she wanted to hear, regardless of what context they had 
been given in.
	Reaching forward, Makoto pulled Ami to her.  The hug was 
awkward because of the angle they were sitting at, but Ami didn&#146;t 
pull away.  After a second&#146;s hesitation, she even returned the hug.
	Just like she&#146;d done with Ami&#146;s words, Makoto allowed herself 
to feel what she most wanted.  In this one moment, she was being 
held by someone who loved her the way she wanted to be loved.
	A throat being cleared got the girls&#146; attention and they 
pulled apart.
	The basketball coach wore a cocky grin as she said, &#147;Take it 
somewhere else, ladies.  Practice is about to start.&#148;


*            *            *

	The little girl stood at the auditorium doors, a huge grin on 
her face.  She had come to watch the blonde girl during practice 
every day this week.  So far this was her favorite part of the play.
	The blonde, whose name on stage was Gisette, sighed.  Her 
manner suggested she wished for nothing more than for the boy 
talking to her to go away.  The girl then shrugged resignedly and 
turned to face the boy.
	&#147;My life is a salad bowl,&#148; said Gisette, &#147;and I seem to be the 
onions.&#148;
	The boy, Gabriel, smirked at her.  &#147;You do have a way of 
making people cry.&#148;
	Gisette perched on the edge of her writing desk.  &#147;Only when 
cut into, my dear Gabriel.  And then, only the very weak of heart.&#148;
	Gabriel&#146;s humor was high as he asked, &#147;And I, my lovely 
Gisette?  What am I in the salad bowl of your life?&#148;
	The little girl glared at the two girls who were giggling 
quietly in the back row as Gisette regarded Gabriel for several 
seconds.
	&#147;You are the garlic,&#148; Gisette finally announced.  &#147;Tolerable 
only in small doses and apt to leave a foul sort of aftertaste.&#148;
	Gabriel&#146;s smile dulled somewhat as he moved closer to Gisette.  
&#147;The lady wounds, or at least attempts to.  But may I point out that 
if we are what you say, then you and I are the perfect match.&#148;
	&#147;Shoot him down, girl,&#148; loudly whispered the dark haired 
onlooker.  Her blonde companion put a hand to her mouth to try and 
hide her laughter.
	&#147;I think not,&#148; said Gisette, standing to her full height and 
staring straight on at Gabriel.  &#147;I have no desire to be doubly 
repulsed.  And let&#146;s not forget your wife &#150; the perfect cherry 
tomato.&#148;
	The blonde in the audience looked scandalized.  &#147;I knew it!  
The cad!&#148;
	Another round of giggles erupted from the girls, who were both 
still oblivious to the death stares being shot at them from the 
partially opened doorway.
	On stage, Gabriel laughed heartily at Gisette.  &#147;Is that what 
she is?&#148; he asked.
	&#147;Mmmmm&#133; Round and brightly colored, the perfect showpiece of 
any salad.  But let&#146;s face it, when you get right down to it, there 
isn&#146;t much substance to be found within.&#148;
	&#147;Too true,&#148; answered Gabriel with a sad shake of his head.  
&#147;But dare I ask, Gisette, what does that make your husband?&#148;
	Gisette snorted derisively.  &#147;My husband is a day old slice of 
bread lying comfortably on a pretty china plate watching the salad 
and waiting for someone to liven his life by applying a pat of 
butter or smear of jam.  No, Gabriel, my husband is no cherry tomato.  
But my husband he is and I won&#146;t be changing that any time soon.&#148;
	The dark haired girl nudged the blonde.  &#147;Hear that?  I&#146;m 
moldy bread and she still loves me just the way I am.&#148;
	The blonde nodded.  &#147;Especially with jam.&#148;
	The dark haired girl had a huge smile on her face.  The child 
knew she was going to make a comment about the one on stage liking 
strawberry best.  Yet, just as the words were about to be said, the 
dark haired girl paused.  The smile left her face and she turned to 
the doorway.
	~Uh oh,~ thought the little girl.  ~Looks like it&#146;s time for 
me to leave.~
	The door closed quickly as the child bolted down the hallway 
toward the exit.  She was almost there when two girls suddenly 
appeared in her way.  She skidded to a halt, barely able to keep 
from running into them.
	The taller of the two yelled at her to watch where she was 
going.  The little girl didn&#146;t respond, just maneuvered around them 
and out the doorway.


	Rei came hurrying out of the auditorium, Usagi at her heels.  
&#147;Where did she go?&#148; she called to Ami and Makoto when she saw them 
standing in the hall.
	&#147;Who?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;That kid,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;She had dark hair and some sort of 
weird headband or something on her head.&#148;
	&#147;She ran out the door,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;She was moving like 
the devil was at her heels.  Guess this explains why.&#148;
	&#147;Why were you looking for her?&#148; asked Ami.
	&#147;I wasn&#146;t.  Not really.&#148;  Rei frowned and shook her head.  &#147;It 
was nothing.&#148;
	&#147;Are you sure?&#148; Makoto asked.  &#147;We could go look for her.&#148;
	&#147;No,&#148; answered Rei.  &#147;She was just an annoying kid.  Nothing 
to worry about.&#148;


*            *            *

	Kaya made a few more notes in the margin of the paper in front 
of her, then closed the file.  With a weary sigh, she removed her 
glasses and pinched the bridge of her nose.
	A light knock on her open study door made Kaya turn.
	&#147;Goodnight, Mom,&#148; said Ami.  &#147;I&#146;m going up to bed now.&#148;
	Kaya smiled and motioned to her daughter.  &#147;Come kiss your 
mother goodnight.&#148;
	Ami walked over to her mother and bent down, Kaya placing a 
light kiss on her forehead.  &#147;Sweet dreams, sweetheart.&#148;
	&#147;You, too, Mom,&#148; answered Ami. Noticing the stack of files and 
papers scattered on the desk, she added, &#147;Don&#146;t stay up too late 
with all of this.  You&#146;ve been working hard, and you need some 
sleep.&#148;
	Kaya chuckled.  &#147;I think that&#146;s supposed to be my line.&#148;


	Ami turned from her stomach to her side, twisting her sheets 
around her legs in the process.  After a short struggle and several 
annoyed kicks, the sheets joined the comforter on the floor.
	Now on her back, Ami blinked up at her ceiling.  She was tired, 
but couldn&#146;t fall asleep.  Not permanently, anyway.  She was sure 
she had drifted off a few times.  Yet, each time her mind would seem 
to latch on to some new thought and pull her into consciousness.  
She was tired of thinking; all she wanted now was sleep.
	Finally, Ami just gave up.  She would be getting up for school 
soon anyway.  She got out of bed and pulled on her robe, then headed 
downstairs to get breakfast.
	The house was still dark, and as Ami walked to the kitchen, 
she noticed the light on in her mother&#146;s study.  Peeking her head in 
the doorway, Ami saw Kaya asleep on the small couch in the room.  
Her glasses were sitting at an odd angle on her face and her feet 
were propped up on the arm of the couch.  On her chest was a closed 
folder, her hand still holding it loosely.
	Ami smiled at the familiar sight, finding comfort in knowing 
some things would never change.
	~And you always worry about me working too hard,~ thought Ami 
as she entered the room.
	She first went over to the end table that sat next to the 
couch.  Ami picked up the travel alarm that rested there and made 
sure it was set to the usual time.  She gave a small nod when the 
clock showed 5:30 am.  That would give her mother about an hour more 
of sleep.
	After putting the clock down, Ami moved over to the desk.  She 
meant only to turn the desk light off.  But as she reached for the 
switch, her arm bumped an over-balanced pencil holder that was 
sitting precariously on a stack of notepads and medical journals.
	Ami made a grab for the pencil holder, catching it and 
managing to keep all of its contents intact.  When she reached for 
the pencil holder, however, her hip had gone forward and clipped the 
stack of paper, knocking it off center.  While her position against 
the desk had kept most of it from falling completely, a few of the 
notepads slid past her and landed with a &lt;thwack!&gt; on the hardwood 
floor.
	Ami quickly set the pencil holder down and righted the pile of 
paper.  She turned to the couch, ready to apologize for disturbing 
her mother&#146;s rest.  The apology died on her lips, though, as she saw 
Kaya still sleeping soundly.
	With a sigh of relief, Ami bent to pick up what she had 
knocked to the floor.  She wasn&#146;t afraid her mother would be upset 
with her.  In all honesty, she couldn&#146;t remember her mother ever 
being truly angry with her for anything.  The relief she felt came 
more from knowing she hadn&#146;t taken away the sleep her workaholic 
mother so needed.
	Ami stood and placed the notepads on her mother&#146;s desk.  No, 
her mother had never been angry at her.  Because Ami had never given 
her reason to be.  She never lied, or cheated, or broke any of the 
rules.  Well, except for those few occasions where Senshi duty 
required it.  For some reason, those instances seemed to be simply 
overlooked.  A small favor from Fate, perhaps, to make things a bit 
easier.
	&#147;Easier,&#148; murmured Ami as she ran a finger along the top of 
the small notepad that sat on top of the pile.  She could feel the 
raised print of her mother&#146;s name and title on the pad of her 
fingertip.
	Without allowing herself to think about it, Ami tore the first 
few pages off her mother&#146;s prescription pad and quickly left the 
room.


*            *            *

	&#147;I don&#146;t want you taking phys ed anymore,&#148; said Ami.  &#147;Not 
after what happened yesterday.&#148;
	Makoto stared at the paper Ami held out to her.  They were 
standing in Makoto&#146;s apartment an hour before school was to start.  
For the second day in a row, Ami had surprised her with an early 
visit.  Under better circumstances, Makoto would have been glad for 
her friend&#146;s newfound habit.
	&#147;What is it?&#148; asked Makoto.
	&#147;An excuse.  A temporary one, at least,&#148; answered Ami.
	Makoto took the paper and read the brief note.  Her eyes 
darkened with the sudden anger she felt.  &#147;I told you not to tell 
anyone.  Why did you tell your mom?&#148;
	&#147;I didn&#146;t.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s her signature.&#148;
	&#147;No, it&#146;s not,&#148; said Ami, quietly bowing her head.  &#147;It&#146;s 
mine.&#148;
	&#147;Oh.&#148;  Makoto&#146;s anger died out as Ami tried to hide her eyes.  
Deception wasn&#146;t something Ami was comfortable with and it showed.  
&#147;I can&#146;t take this,&#148; said Makoto with a shake of her head.  She 
tried to hand the note back to Ami.
	Ami refused to take it back.  &#147;You have to, Mako-chan.  Until 
you go to a doctor, it&#146;s the only way to keep you out of that 
class.&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t need to be kept out of that class.  You don&#146;t have to 
worry about me.&#148;  Makoto put a hand on Ami&#146;s shoulder so the girl 
would look back up at her.  &#147;It&#146;s nice that you&#146;re trying to take 
care of me, but I don&#146;t want you compromising yourself to do it.  I 
promise I&#146;ll be careful.&#148;
	&#147;Like you were yesterday?&#148; asked Ami.  She looked at Makoto 
and tried to sound firm.  This was necessary for her friend.  She 
herself was irrelevant.  &#147;You push yourself too hard, Mako-chan.  
You may not mean to, but you do and you will.  Pushing yourself that 
extra bit physically is how you deal with stress.&#148;
	Makoto grinned.  &#147;And I suppose next you&#146;re going to tell me 
I&#146;m under a great deal of stress?&#148;
	Ami nodded.
	&#147;All right,&#148; relented Makoto.
	&#147;As I said,&#148; continued Ami, &#147;it&#146;s only temporary.  It&#146;s 
authentic enough and shouldn&#146;t be questioned, but you need to see a 
real doctor.  You also need to consider telling the others.  The 
longer you put it off the harder it will be.  Not to mention, you 
risk them finding out some other way.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;ve been thinking about that a bit, actually.&#148;  Makoto 
turned towards the kitchen.  &#147;Do you mind coming in here for a few?&#148;
	Ami followed Makoto into the kitchen.  She took a seat on one 
of the barstools as Makoto opened the refrigerator.
	&#147;I noticed these last night,&#148; said Makoto.  She pulled out two 
of the pudding cups.  &#147;I&#146;m going to have to find a way to thank my 
snack fairy.&#148;
	Makoto sat next to Ami at the breakfast counter and put one of 
the cups and a spoon in front of her.  Ami declined the offer, 
resisting the urge to point out vanilla pudding wasn&#146;t a proper 
breakfast.
	Makoto shrugged.  &#147;More for me.  Anyway,&#148; she continued 
between spoonfuls, &#147;about telling the others.  I was thinking about 
waiting until after Minako&#146;s play.  That way, I won&#146;t be taking away 
any of her spotlight.  Plus, it gives me some time to figure out 
what I&#146;m going to say.&#148;
	&#147;Makes sense.  And the doctor?&#148;
	&#147;You&#146;re not going to let that part go, are you?&#148;  Makoto 
sighed.  &#147;Look, Ami, it&#146;s been a long time since I went to a doctor, 
so I don&#146;t really have one.  Aside from that, I&#146;ve never been to&#133; 
one of THOSE doctors before.  I&#146;m not looking forward to it.&#148;
	Ami could see the slight blush rising to Makoto&#146;s cheeks.  She 
was about to respond when the clock on the wall chimed at half past 
the hour.
	&#147;Damn,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Come on, we have to hurry.  The 
principal said if I&#146;m late one more time this term, I&#146;m going to be 
spending my afternoons making up for it in detention.&#148;


*            *            *

	Rei sat quietly in front of the fire.  Eyes closed, her 
breathing controlled, she tried to concentrate on what the flames 
were trying to show her.
	After a time, the shape of the fire began to change.  The feel 
of it became different, losing some of the warmth Rei always 
associated with the sacred flame.  Around it now she could see a 
stone hearth that stretched across a stone wall.  The wall took on 
more form, becoming a room fashioned from cold stone.
	Along the walls were windows of dark stained glass which 
blocked any sunlight from entering the room.  Around the windows 
were curtains of sheer dark blue.  The material was the same as that 
which formed a canopy around the large bed that dominated the room.
	On the bed was a quilt of deep blue with intricate gold 
stitching.  A pile of pillows at the headboard had the same 
stitchwork decorating them.  And right in the middle of the pile of 
pillows slept a dark tabby cat.
	The feeling Rei had been trying to grasp heightened at the 
sight of the little cat.  It wasn&#146;t so much a sense of evil and 
dread was too strong a word.  Trouble was the only thing she could 
think of and a certainty that something was going to happen.
	Rei looked around at the shelves of knick-knacks and ornaments 
that decorated the room.  Most of the objects seemed to be made of 
either glass or crystal.  The one that caught her eye, though, was a 
golden statue of a cat that sat on a shelf over the fireplace.  As 
she stared at it, the cat defied its place in the order of things by 
standing and stretching.  Gold flakes rained down to the carpet as 
the cat shook itself.
	The now sandy-furred cat jumped down from the shelf, moving to 
where Rei would have been had she truly been standing in the room.  
Firelight glinting off its shiny red collar, the cat circled her 
several times, regarding her curiously with its blue eyes.
	Finally coming to rest behind her, the cat rose and placed its 
front paws on Rei&#146;s shoulder.  Purring, it nuzzled against her neck.  
Just as Rei&#146;s senses were registering how soft the cat&#146;s fur felt, 
she was overwhelmed with a new sensation.  The cat was sucking on 
her earlobe.
	Rei snapped back to herself just as a hand was working its way 
inside the front of her dogi.  She grabbed at the hand, stopping its 
progress.
	&#147;Welcome back,&#148; whispered Minako into the ear she had been 
favoring.  She sat back from Rei and smiled at the miko.  &#147;I hope I 
didn&#146;t interrupt anything.&#148;
	Rei blinked at Minako a few times before her mind fully 
focused.  Finally, she said, &#147;I thought your mom said you couldn&#146;t 
stay tonight.&#148;
	&#147;Daddy changed her mind.&#148;  Minako smirked.  &#147;They&#146;ve been 
fighting all afternoon.  I think they want some time to make up 
without having to worry about me hearing.&#148;
	&#147;That was more information than I needed,&#148; said Rei with a 
grimace.
	Minako laughed.  &#147;Sorry.  Allow me to make it up to you.&#148;
	Minako leaned forward and pressed her lips gently to Rei&#146;s.  
When she felt the other girl begin to respond, Minako put her hands 
on Rei&#146;s shoulders and carefully pushed her onto her back.
	After several minutes, the girls broke the kiss, both 
breathing hard.  Minako stared down at Rei, her finger toying with 
the dark, sweaty bangs that covered Rei&#146;s forehead.  She idly 
wondered how long Rei had been in front of the fire this evening.
	&#147;Actually,&#148; started Minako quietly, &#147;there was something I 
wanted to talk to you about.&#148;
	Rei refocused at the sudden seriousness in Minako&#146;s voice.  
She took her hands from Minako&#146;s hips and put them behind her head.  
&#147;What is it?&#148;
	Minako rolled off of Rei and lay beside her on the floor, 
hands under her head imitating Rei.  &#147;Makoto and Ami,&#148; she began, 
&#147;they&#146;re hiding something from us.  I&#146;m not buying the whole anemia 
story.  Ami couldn&#146;t even look us in the eye when they were telling 
it to us at school.&#148;
	&#147;I thought it sounded a little strange when I heard it from 
Usagi.  But I just chalked that up to it coming from Usagi,&#148; replied 
Rei.  &#147;Any ideas?&#148;
	&#147;No.  And I&#146;m not even sure she&#146;s lying.  The truth is, I&#146;m 
afraid Mako-chan is sugarcoating whatever&#146;s wrong.  And if it&#146;s 
really serious, we&#146;re going to find out when it&#146;s too late.&#148;
	Rei chuckled lightly.  &#147;You&#146;re not beginning to believe 
Usagi&#146;s theory that Makoto is really dying, are you?  Because even 
Usagi is over that now.&#148;
	Minako frowned and shook her head.  &#147;That isn&#146;t what I mean.&#148;  
She looked over at Rei.  &#147;All of you are my responsibility.  If we 
have to go into battle and she isn&#146;t up to a fight, I need to know.  
That way, I can be sure we&#146;re prepared.&#148;  Minako lifted her fingers 
to gently caress Rei&#146;s cheek.  &#147;Otherwise, someone might get hurt.&#148;
	Rei took the hand that was against her cheek.  She brought it 
to her lips and kissed the palm, then the inside of the wrist.  She 
heard Minako sigh, and moved over the girl in a reverse of their 
earlier position.
	Rei leaned in close and kissed Minako&#146;s forehead.  She then 
pulled back enough so she could look into her eyes.  &#147;If it were 
truly serious, Mako-chan would tell us.  As for whatever secret they 
may have, for right now let&#146;s just let them have it.&#148;  Rei smiled.  
&#147;We all have our secrets, after all.&#148;
	&#147;Just until I graduate, Rei,&#148; said Minako more seriously than 
Rei wanted her at the moment.  &#147;I&#146;ll tell them then.  I promise.&#148;
	&#147;I know, Mina.&#148;  Rei bent to nuzzle Minako&#146;s neck, kissing her 
way back up to the girl&#146;s soft lips.  She felt Minako relax beneath 
her and lost herself in the sensation.
	Everything was going perfectly right up until the door slid 
open and a teapot crashed against the floor.


*            *            *

	Ami put a hand to her mouth to hide her yawn.  It was out of 
reflex rather than politeness, seeing as how she was the only 
passenger on the bus.  The 1:00 am route tended to be pretty light 
on riders.
	Ami leaned her head against the window and tried to keep from 
falling asleep.  She was thinking maybe it would have been better to 
stay the night at Makoto&#146;s after all.  But two nights in a row 
seemed to be pushing it, especially since she&#146;d told her mother she 
would be home.
	The bus came to her stop.  As Ami gathered her things to get 
off, she looked at her watch.  She felt like she needed more sleep 
than she was going to get for school tomorrow, but she hadn&#146;t wanted 
to leave Makoto&#146;s any sooner.  Coming home to an empty house was 
never something she looked forward to.
	Things had gone well with Makoto&#146;s fake medical condition.  
Things seemed to be going smoothly for everyone.  Then something 
happened with Rei and her grandfather sometime Saturday night.  She 
had shown up on Makoto&#146;s doorstep, sleeping bag and Minako in tow.  
The two of them had spent the night on Makoto&#146;s floor.  Rei never 
said what exactly happened, only that they needed to move the study 
meetings somewhere else for a while.
	Makoto&#146;s apartment was nominated for the week.  Since she 
couldn&#146;t find a good reason not to agree, the group started meeting 
there last night.  Not that it had been a real meeting.  Minako&#146;s 
play, &#147;The Shop Keeper,&#148; was opening, and the girls had used the 
apartment solely as a meeting point on the way to the school.
	Usagi, Makoto, and Ami had met Rei at the auditorium.  They 
watched the play, and when Minako came out for her bow at the end, 
all four were on their feet and cheering.  It was a rare thing for a 
second year student to get the leading role, and they were going to 
give their friend all the attention she deserved.
	Afterward, they had stopped for ice cream, the four girls each 
chipping in to treat Minako.  When Usagi&#146;s sundae was placed in 
front of her, Makoto&#146;s eyes lit up.  The thing was twice as big as 
her double scoop, covered in chocolate fudge, whipped cream, and 
cherries, with chocolate covered Oreo&#146;s decorating the sides.
	Before the waitress could get away, Makoto caught her and 
pointed to Usagi.  &#147;Could I have one of those, too?  But with peanut 
butter ice cream instead.  The vanilla kind.&#148;
	The waitress nodded.
	Makoto thanked her, then turned back to her fudge swirl double.  
&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; she asked when she noticed the others all staring at 
her and Usagi protectively holding her sundae close to her.
	&#147;That&#146;s an awful lot of ice cream, Mako-chan,&#148; said Rei.  
&#147;Trying to out-eat Usagi isn&#146;t a great idea.&#148;
	&#147;Leave the poor anemic girl alone, will ya,&#148; said Makoto.  
&#147;Anyway, it&#146;ll help build up my blood count.&#148;
	&#147;Your blood count isn&#146;t what&#146;s going to get built up if you 
keep eating like that,&#148; laughed Minako.
	Makoto stuck her tongue out at the blonde.
	Rei was right, Ami thought.  It wasn&#146;t a good idea to try to 
outdo Usagi.  Ami could tell the moment Makoto&#146;s indulgence turned 
on her.  All in all, she was amazed Makoto made it back to her 
apartment building, even if she didn&#146;t make it to her apartment.
	And Ami had stayed.  She had changed from her uniform at 
Makoto&#146;s earlier, so she was covered for school this morning.  
Makoto gave her a t-shirt to sleep in, and Ami had briefly hoped she 
would forget to ask for it back.  Maybe she could offer to wash it 
and then accidentally forget to return it&#133;
	That little fantasy aside, tonight&#146;s meeting couldn&#146;t really 
be called a meeting, either.  Rei had left a half hour into it; she 
planned on being there each night Minako was on stage.  The half 
hour she had been there was occupied with finalizing the plans for 
the surprise closing-night party they were having for Minako.
	Ami hadn&#146;t lasted much longer than Rei.  She had cram school 
to get to.  As could be expected, Ami&#146;s absence pretty much killed 
the study part of the meeting.
	When her classes were over, Ami decided to stop back by 
Makoto&#146;s.  Usagi was still there, saying her parents didn&#146;t expect 
her home until nine, so she and Makoto had made a cherry pie to kill 
some time.
	&#147;She fell asleep about a half hour ago,&#148; said Usagi, pointing 
to the couch.  &#147;She looked like she was getting really tired, so I 
washed the dishes for her.  I ate most of the pie, anyway, so it was 
only fair.&#148;
	After Ami and Usagi said good-bye, Ami decided to stay for 
just a bit longer.  So she curled up in a chair with her book and 
watched her friend sleep.
	Now here she was, struggling with her house keys, after 
declining Makoto&#146;s offer to spend the night.  Ami finally got the 
door open and dropped her books in the foyer.  All she wanted to do 
was fall into bed and sleep like the dead.
	&#147;Ami.&#148;
	~Oh, no.  She isn&#146;t supposed to be home.~
	&#147;Could you come in here, please.&#148;  It wasn&#146;t a question, Ami 
could tell by the tone of her mother&#146;s voice.  It wasn&#146;t one she 
heard often, and it was never directed at her.
	Ami walked slowly into the living room, not knowing entirely 
what to expect.  &#147;Mom?&#148;
	Kaya removed her glasses and set the papers she was reading on 
the ottoman of the chair she sat in.  &#147;You&#146;re home a bit late, 
aren&#146;t you?  Cram school got over at eight, and I was under the 
impression that you would be coming home right afterward.  Or did I 
misunderstand something you told me?&#148;
	Ami&#146;s eyes were on the floor as she mumbled out, &#147;No, ma&#146;am.&#148;
	&#147;Where were you?&#148;
	&#147;At Makoto&#146;s.&#148;
	Kaya nodded.  She was expecting that answer.  She could 
understand Ami wanting to spend time with her girlfriend, but she 
was going to expect her to be honest about it.  And after the call 
she got this afternoon, she needed to know what was going on.
	&#147;I don&#146;t have a problem with you wanting to spend time with 
your friend,&#148; said Kaya, wishing Ami would look up at her.  &#147;However, 
I would rather you just stay the night than have you walking around 
alone this time of the night.  I also don&#146;t expect you to lie to me 
about where you&#146;re going to be.  Believe it or not, Ami, I do have 
some idea about what&#146;s going on in your life, even if I&#146;m not here 
as much as either of us would like.&#148;
	&#147;I know, Mom,&#148; answered Ami quietly.  She glanced up at her 
mother.  What she saw wasn&#146;t as bad as she feared.  But she could 
tell her mother was waiting for something more.
	After a significant pause, Kaya finally asked, &#147;Do you have 
anything you&#146;d like to add?&#148;
	Ami thought perhaps her mother would like her to promise it 
would never happen again.  But seeing as how she was being chastised 
for lying, adding one more to the pile seemed like a bad idea.  &#147;No, 
ma&#146;am,&#148; said Ami with a shake of her head.
	Kaya sighed.  Then she got up and began to pace.  Ami knew 
right then that she had given the wrong answer.
	&#147;As I was saying,&#148; began Kaya, her words sounding as measured 
as her strides, &#147;I don&#146;t want you out this late at night by yourself, 
especially on school nights.  The world&#146;s a dangerous place, Ami.  
You never know what kind of people you&#146;ll run into when no one is 
looking.&#148;
	Kaya motioned for Ami to sit.  Ami did as instructed.
	&#147;At work,&#148; continued Kaya, &#147;we have all sorts of safeguards in 
place just because of those kinds of people.  Some of them seem 
ridiculous on the surface, but really do have a point to them.  For 
instance,&#148; here Kaya waved her hand as if she were just pulling the 
example from thin air, &#147;they make us keep count of the number of 
pages on our prescription pads.&#148;
	Ami&#146;s reaction was minute, but Kaya saw it just the same.  
That bit of panic in her daughter&#146;s stance told her some of what she 
needed to know.  Yet Ami remained silent, so she continued.
	&#147;That can be a tricky thing, mind you,&#148; went on Kaya.  &#147;Things 
can get pretty hectic in the ER, and it&#146;s easy to lose count once in 
a while.  I&#146;ve come up short once or twice myself.&#148;
	Kaya went back to her chair and sat.  &#147;The ER can be a crazy 
place.  So much so, that some people just get to the point where 
they can&#146;t take it anymore.  I knew this one woman a few years back.  
She was a very good nurse, but she just got to the point where she 
needed a less stressful job.&#148;  Kaya chuckled.  &#147;Imagine her thinking 
high schoolers would be less stressful.
	&#147;Anyway, I got a call from her today.  We&#146;ve kept in touch, 
you see.  It seems one of my patients is a student at the high 
school where she works.  She was hoping I could enlighten her to the 
seriousness of the girl&#146;s condition.&#148;
	A choked sob from Ami cut Kaya off.  Her heart broke at seeing 
her little girl cry, but things had gotten serious.  She needed 
information if she was going to help at all.
	&#147;You know what I&#146;m asking you, Ami,&#148; said Kaya firmly, but not 
unkindly.  &#147;You&#146;ve involved me in something without my permission 
and I want to know what&#146;s going on.&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s pregnant,&#148; said Ami quietly.
	Kaya felt that if she hadn&#146;t been sitting right then she would 
have fallen.  &#147;Excuse me?&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s pregnant,&#148; repeated Ami a little louder this time.   
&#147;She just found out, and she refuses to go see a doctor.  But she 
pushes herself too hard physically.  It&#146;s how she is.  There was an 
incident in gym class the other day, and I needed to get her out 
before she did something stupid.&#148;
	&#147;Hold on a second, Ami,&#148; said Kaya.  She rubbed at her eyes 
for a moment, trying to get rid of the feeling of having the floor 
pulled out from under her.  &#147;We are talking about Makoto, right?&#148;
	Ami nodded.  She wiped at her cheeks and sniffled.
	Kaya tried to refocus.  &#147;What about the father?  Her 
boyfriend?&#148; she asked uncertainly.
	&#147;No,&#148; answered Ami, &#147;he isn&#146;t.&#148;
	Kaya frowned at a new thought.  &#147;Was it consensual?&#148;
  	Ami nodded.  &#147;It&#146;s not something she&#146;s proud of, and she 
hasn&#146;t told him.  I don&#146;t think it would matter if she did.  He 
isn&#146;t the type to stay.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m at a loss right now, Ami,&#148; admitted Kaya.  &#147;This is so 
far from anything I was expecting to hear.&#148;  Kaya took a deep breath 
and released it, pushing aside the doubt she felt and coming to a 
decision.  &#147;While I can understand you wanting to help her, I can&#146;t 
just overlook how you went about it.  For the rest of the week, the 
only two places you&#146;ll be going are school and home.  If I find out 
you&#146;ve gone anywhere else, we&#146;re going to be having another 
conversation like this one.  Am I making myself clear?&#148;
	&#147;Yes.&#148;
	&#147;Ami, look at me.&#148;  Kaya leaned forward in her chair, her 
expression soft.  &#147;I don&#146;t want you to think you have to hide things 
from me.  If you ever need help, come to me and tell me.&#148;
	Ami smiled weakly and nodded.
	&#147;All right, it&#146;s late.  Get to bed.&#148;
	Ami stood and headed for the hall.  At the entryway she 
hesitated for a moment, then went back to her mother.  As she bent 
for a hug, Ami whispered, &#147;I love you, Mom.&#148;
	Kaya held her daughter tightly.  &#147;I love you, too, 
sweetheart.&#148;
	Ami released her mother from the embrace and headed to her 
room.  As she disappeared up the stairs, Kaya was left to wonder how 
well she knew her daughter after all.


*            *            *

	Kaya poked at her salad with her fork.  &#147;So obviously it isn&#146;t 
what I thought it was,&#148; she finished explaining to the man sitting 
across from her.
	Ken couldn&#146;t help but grin.  &#147;Kaya, you are the only woman I 
know who could be disappointed to find out her daughter isn&#146;t 
sneaking out to have sex with her girlfriend.&#148;
	Kaya frowned.  &#147;That has nothing to do with it.  Not entirely, 
anyway.  Besides, I like this girl.  She would have been good for 
Ami.&#148;
	&#147;Are you sure?&#148;  Ken put up his hands defensively at the look 
Kaya shot him.  &#147;I&#146;m just saying maybe you don&#146;t know this girl as 
well as you think.&#148;
	&#147;I know my daughter&#146;s friends,&#148; said Kaya defensively.  &#147;I may 
not be soccer mom of the year, but neither did I just hand Ami a 
credit card and turn her loose on the streets.  And I do listen when 
she talks to me.  When we were away, every other sentence from Ami 
had something to do with Makoto, and I don&#146;t even think she realized 
it.  While it&#146;s been a few decades, I do remember what it was like 
to be young and in love for the first time.  I thought that&#146;s what I 
was seeing in her.&#148;
	&#147;Maybe you are,&#148; speculated Ken.  Kaya tilted her head 
quizzically, so he continued.  &#147;The first time I fell in love, it 
was with the girlfriend of the school&#146;s ace pitcher.  She was 
completely unobtainable, but that didn&#146;t stop me from thinking about 
her all the time.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;d rather I was wrong about her being in love,&#148; said Kaya, 
&#147;than to have her in love with someone who won&#146;t love her back.  I 
remember what that was like, too.&#148;
	Ken reached across the table and put a hand over Kaya&#146;s, 
giving it a brief squeeze.  Kaya smiled at the gesture.
	&#147;Regardless of how deep it runs,&#148; continued Kaya, &#147;Makoto is 
Ami&#146;s best friend and she wants to help her.&#148;
	&#147;What about her family?&#148;
	&#147;She hasn&#146;t got any,&#148; answered Kaya.  &#147;She basically raised 
herself.  When I stop to really think about it, I&#146;m amazed something 
like this didn&#146;t happen sooner.&#148;
	&#147;What are you planning on doing?&#148;
	&#147;There isn&#146;t really much I can do.  There is this one thing, 
though.&#148;  Kaya put on a smile that was solely for Ken.  &#147;Makoto has 
been reluctant to see an OB.  And I&#146;d really like for her to be 
treated by someone who will handle the situation with a bit of 
tact.&#148;
	&#147;I have some time open on Friday,&#148; said Ken with a grin.  &#147;If 
you can get her to call the office this afternoon, I&#146;ll make sure 
they know where to schedule her.&#148;
	&#147;I was hoping you would say that.&#148;  Then Kaya frowned.  
&#147;Except, what&#146;s your schedule like on Saturday?&#148;
	&#147;Why?&#148;
	Kaya looked down at her salad and idly pushed a few pieces of 
lettuce around.  &#147;I&#146;m guessing Ami&#146;s going to want to go with her, 
but I grounded her until Saturday.&#148;
	Ken chuckled.  &#147;I was wondering how you handled that.&#148;
	&#147;It was too harsh, wasn&#146;t it?&#148;  Kaya sighed.  &#147;I had to do 
something.  I swear the last time I had to discipline Ami for 
anything was when she was four.  Grounding her was the only thing I 
could think of.&#148;
	&#147;You grounded her for three days, Kaya.  That isn&#146;t harsh.  If 
it had been one of mine, they&#146;d have been grounded for a month.&#148;  
Ken favored Kaya with a reassuring smile.  His eyes held hers and 
she smiled back.
	The moment was broken by a high-pitched beep.  Ken pulled out 
his beeper.  &#147;The Ogawa baby,&#148; he said.  &#147;Guess this means lunch is 
over.  I&#146;ll talk to my receptionist and see what she can juggle 
around for Saturday.&#148;
	With a quick kiss, the two said goodbye.  Kaya gathered the 
remains of her lunch and disposed of them.  She then headed home to 
try and get some sleep before she had to go on shift later tonight.


	When Ami got home from school that afternoon, she found a note 
from her mother.
	
		You get one phone call this afternoon.  Make it count.
