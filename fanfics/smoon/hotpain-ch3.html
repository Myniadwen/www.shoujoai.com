<h1>Hotaru's Pain (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/lectricity.html">The Ghost of 'lectricity</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hotpain-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre> &lt;Two years... Two years since she left...&gt;
 &quot;Tomoe Hotaru!&quot; The sharp voice emanating from the teacher knocked 
the black haired girl out of her thoughts.
 &quot;Tomoe Hotaru, do you know the answer?&quot;
 Hotaru looked around the class, everybody was looking at her and 
the teacher was waiting for an answer. The moment somebody 
whispered the right answer, the teacher already got tired of 
waiting.
 &quot;Hotaru, you have been daydreaming again. I will have to report 
you to your class teacher. Now pay attention to the rest of the 
lesson.&quot;

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru entered the kitchen and put her schoolbag down next to the 
table. Setsuna was making lunch and Haruka sat at the dinner table.
 &quot;Was there any mail for me?&quot; Hotaru asked, looking at Setsuna. The 
tall woman was making lunch and completely ignored the younger girl 
behind her back. The moment of silence was only to be broken by 
Haruka&#39;s voice.
 &quot;Sorry, nothing for you Hotaru-chan.&quot;
 Ever since ChibiUsa left two years ago Setsuna brought Hotaru 
letters from the princess every now and then. Setsuna broke almost 
every taboo by doing this. She couldn&#39;t help it when ChibiUsa 
looked at her with pleading eyes in Crystal Tokyo and Hotaru with 
much the same eyes in the 20th century. Setsuna could only bring 
over a letter every few months and ChibiUsa wasn&#39;t allowed to write 
anything about the future. This was why their letters were very 
intense and emotional and Hotaru liked it that way. Although she 
was wondering about her future self and about Crystal Tokyo, she 
was grateful that she could still be in contact with ChibiUsa. But 
in the past four months no letter came from the princess.
 Although she tried to ignore the little girl, Setsuna&#39;s heart was 
breaking at the thought that she couldn&#39;t bring Hotaru any messages 
from ChibiUsa this time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In her dark room Hotaru sat down on the bed and her mind drifted 
away from her surroundings.
 &lt;Why won&#39;t she write? Is ChibiUsa hurt? Or maybe even sick? Maybe 
she doesn&#39;t love me anymore? Maybe she never loved me... No! She 
said she loves me. Nobody forced her to say that!&gt;
 Hotaru rolled over on her bed and opened a drawer on her night 
table. She pulled out a bunch of letters and turned on a lamp 
beside her bed.
 She began reading the old love letters when her dark, purple eyes 
spotted something she hadn&#39;t noticed before. Inside the envelope of 
the last letter were a few words written:

		&#39;ps: i have a suprize for u.&#39;

This was definitely written by ChibiUsa. It was her handwriting and 
even Neo Queen Serenity couldn&#39;t make that many errors. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The rest of the day was quiet at the house where the Outer Senshi 
lived. Haruka and Michiru rented a romantic movie which they 
watched in their bedroom. Setsuna was calculating some time 
anomalies on her computer and Hotaru was thinking about the note 
she found in the envelope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The raven haired girl woke up with an unusual feeling the next 
morning. Something is going to happen. Something important.
 &quot;What is it, Hotaru-chan?&quot; Michiru asked while Hotaru was silently 
eating her breakfast.
 &quot;Nothing, Michiru-mama.&quot;
 &quot;Come on, I can see something is wrong, sweetie.&quot;
 &quot;It&#39;s nothing really. It&#39;s just this strange feeling.&quot;
 At this point Haruka and Setsuna became interested too.
 &quot;A new enemy?&quot; Haruka asked.
 &quot;No, no. Nothing like that. I just have this strange feeling 
something important is going to happen to me...&quot;
 Suddenly the sound of a horn from a car thundered in front of the 
house.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;What do you think she&#39;s going to say, Usagi-chan?&quot;
 The sound of Usagi&#39;s laughter chimed throughout the car.
 &quot;What is it, got cold feet?&quot;
 &quot;No!&quot;
 &quot;Are you ready?&quot; Mamoru asked.
 &quot;Wait a minute.&quot; The girl sitting in the back of the car got out 
and took a deep breath. She was very obviously nervous.
 &quot;Okay, I&#39;m ready.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The three young women and the girl looked at each other at the 
sound of the horn and jointly got up. Hotaru&#39;s feeling grew 
stronger the closer she came to the front door. She got nervous 
when she reached for the doorknob. Feelings of fear and anger came 
up. Anger because of fear. She&#39;s a senshi. She shouldn&#39;t be afraid. 
Her hand slowly - painfully slowly - pushed the door open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The girl standing next to Mamoru&#39;s car was getting more nervous 
with each second that passed. She was standing on the sidewalk, 
looking at the door of the house in front of her. She looked at 
Usagi and Mamoru, looking for reassurance and found two supporting 
loving smiles.
 Then, the door slowly began to open.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 When Hotaru finally opened the door she saw Mamoru&#39;s car and a 
girl standing beside it. Hotaru could hardly believe her eyes. The 
girl looked about her age, her hair was pink and put up in two 
pointy odangos. Her ponytails reached her knees but were a bit 
puffy at their base. She was slim, her bust was not too big and 
surely not too small. The girl&#39;s beauty hypnotized Hotaru.
 The girl was looking at Hotaru with a nervous smile on her face. 
She was standing perfectly still, like a statue. Usagi&#39;s head 
popped out of Mamoru&#39;s car and she gave the girl a little push. The 
girl made a step forward, then another, then began running towards 
Hotaru.
 &quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; A familiar squeak came from the girl&#39;s mouth and 
tears started filling her crimson eyes.
 &quot;Chi... bi... u... sa...?&quot;
 The girl reached Hotaru, threw her arms around her and began 
crying on her shoulder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;You got so big...&quot;
 &quot;A few hundred years passed in my time since I last saw you.&quot;
 Silence followed for a moment.
 &quot;You are beautiful ChibiUsa-chan.&quot; Another moment of silence 
passed as they were staring deeply into each other&#39;s eyes. Hotaru 
leaned forward and gently and softly kissed ChibiUsa.
 &quot;Why did you come back?&quot;
 &quot;Because of you. &#150; I came to ask you out on our first official 
date.&quot;
 &quot;Wha-?&quot; Hotaru wasn&#39;t able to finish the word as ChibiUsa pressed 
her lips on Hotaru&#39;s.
 &quot;Don&#39;t you want to go out on a date with me, Taru-chan?&quot; ChibiUsa 
asked mischievously, already seeing the sparks of joy in her 
lover&#39;s eyes.
 &quot;Oh, ChibiUsa-chan! I love you so much!&quot; Hotaru squealed and 
hugged ChibiUsa.
 &quot;Okay, listen. We both go to the shopping center tomorrow and buy 
a nice outfit for our date. You go with your parents and I go with 
the other girls. And we&#39;re not supposed to see what we bought until 
tomorrow evening. &#39;Kay?&quot; Hotaru was amazed.
 &quot;How long did you plan this evening Chibi-chan?&quot;
 &quot;Oh, just the last one hundred years,&quot; she said, causing laughter 
to fill Hotaru&#39;s room.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 &quot;Haruka-papa! Do I look sexy in this?&quot; Hotaru called across the 
store where Haruka and Setsuna were standing. Both looked somewhat 
sad seeing their daughter picking out dresses for her first date.
 &quot;Come on, sweetie. Let&#39;s find something that shows your long legs 
off!&quot; The two heard Michiru say enthusiastically in the distance.
 &quot;We&#39;re losing her,&quot; Haruka commentated on the situation.
 &quot;Yeah. I know.&quot;
 &quot;Michiru doesn&#39;t seem to mind.&quot;
 &quot;She compensates for it by playing dress-up with our daughter.&quot; 
Haruka looked at Setsuna strangely. &quot;What?! Why are you looking at 
me like that? Being the keeper of the gates of time for a couple of 
centuries gets boring from time to time!&quot;
 &quot;Errrr... okay. Oh, look! There&#39;s ChibiUsa-chan with the other 
girls!&quot;
 &quot;Oh no, spies! Hide the dress!&quot; ChibiUsa exclaimed when she saw 
the two women approaching.
 &quot;Don&#39;t worry Small Lady. We won&#39;t tell anything.&quot;
 &quot;Okay, then help me. Haruka-san, do I look sexy in this?&quot;
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For Hotaru this was the happiest day in her life. In a few minutes 
she would go out on her first date. On a date with the person she 
loved more than anything else in the universe. Two years ago she 
had buried the thought of seeing ChibiUsa sooner than in about a 
thousand years, but now she&#39;s here. Here, in the guest room &#150; the 
room next to Hotaru&#39;s - getting ready for their date. Though 
something was still wrong &#150; Hotaru could feel it.
 Suddenly a scratch was heard from the door. This was Diana&#39;s sign 
that ChibiUsa is about to come out of her room. Hotaru looked one 
last time in the mirror, got up from her chair and turned around. 
She was facing her parents now.
 &quot;How do I look?&quot;
 &quot;Pretty.&quot;
 &quot;Adorable.&quot;
 &quot;Sexy.&quot;
 She smiled nervously and walked towards the door. She opened it 
and stepped into the hallway. The hall was filled with people. 
Usagi and her friends were there &#150; they were helping ChibiUsa with 
her make-up and dress. Even Hotaru&#39;s parents stepped out in the 
hallway.

   Suddenly I turned around and she was standing there
   With silver bracelets on her wrists and flowers in her hair
   She walked up to me so gracefully and took my crown of thorns
    &quot;Come in,&quot; she said &quot;I&#39;ll give you
    Shelter from the storm&quot;

Hotaru wrote those words down in her diary a long time ago &#150; 
actually in another lifetime. She heard them in a song on the radio 
some days after she first met ChibiUsa. They fit so well then and 
they fit so well now.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The first stars were already appearing on the evening sky as the 
lovers walked into a restaurant. It was the restaurant which Haruka 
and Michiru often visited.
 Haruka called the restaurant earlier to make sure the girls would 
be treated accordingly and that she would later settle the bill. 
The girls were led to a table for two and ChibiUsa ordered a bottle 
of champagne.
 &quot;Champagne, ChibiUsa-chan? Why did you order champagne?&quot; ChibiUsa 
just shrugged her shoulders.
 &quot;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s a special occasion, isn&#39;t it Taru-chan?&quot;
 Hotaru smiled. &quot;Yes it is,&quot;
 Both were enjoying the tickling of the champagne in their mouths 
and the tickling of love in their stomachs. They both remained 
silent for a couple of minutes, studying the lines of their faces, 
exploring the changes of the years that passed. The purple and 
crimson eyes met and lost themselves in the depths. They were 
holding hands again, just like a long time ago. But this time was 
different. A long time ago they hadn&#39;t confessed their love to each 
other yet.
 Evening turned into night, the crowd in the restaurant thinned 
down.
 &quot;Taru-chan, do you remember the poem you gave me when I left?&quot;
 &quot;The poem? Yes, I remember it. Though I wish I wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s not 
a good poem. It&#39;s stupid.&quot;

    &quot;Little bunny on the moon
    On the moon so far away
    The firefly cannot fly high
    High enough to reach the sky&quot;

    &quot;The little bunny on the moon
    Came down to earth to seek a friend
    Oh firefly, a friend is here
    A friend is here, a love is here&quot;

 Hotaru blushed dark red as ChibiUsa recited the poem Hotaru wrote 
two years ago.
 &quot;You- You learned it by heart...&quot;
 &quot;I think it&#39;s beautiful. Like you.&quot;
 ChibiUsa gently caressed Hotaru&#39;s hands within her own. ChibiUsa&#39;s 
eyes grew darker. Slowly, she was preparing herself to tell Hotaru 
the true reason she had come back.
 &quot;Hotaru, I have to tell you something important. About you and 
me... and the future.&quot;
 Hotaru nodded and smiled to ChibiUsa. She knew she was going to 
hear something she rather wouldn&#39;t but she didn&#39;t want to make it 
harder for ChibiUsa &#150; her true love.
 &quot;I expected that ChibiUsa, I have sensed it since yesterday. Go 
ahead, 
I&#39;m ready.&quot;
 ChibiUsa sighed and began:
 &quot;Hotaru, where I come from, in my future, we two do not have the 
thing we share here. We do not share this love we have here. I 
searched for you after I came back from the past. I found you but 
you were not the same. You... you rejected me.&quot;
 &quot;ChibiUsa...&quot; Hotaru gasped in shock.
 &quot;Yes. And I do not know why. I could see in you eyes you love me. 
I could see the tears that tried to break your eyes but you 
remained strong. You did not even want to talk to me. I came back 
to the past to change that future. Hotaru, I want you to promise me 
something. For what we have here, promise me you will never deceive 
your feelings. And promise me that if you ever stop loving me, you 
will look me in the eyes and tell me that.&quot;
 &quot;ChibiUsa, I will always -&quot;
 &quot;No! Do not tell me you will always love me! Promise me these two 
things!&quot;
 &quot;I promise you.&quot; 
 &quot;Thank you Hotaru. Now I can go back to my future reassured. I was 
only given a limited time here. I will have to leave soon. 
Tomorrow,&quot; ChibiUsa said with a sigh. Three simple words: I promise 
you. Could these three simple words change the future? A future 
that somehow went terribly wrong for her.
 &quot;Tomorrow already? Then... Then we&#39;ll have to make this night a 
night to remember.&quot; Hotaru tried to hide her hurt behind a 
reassuring smile.
 &quot;Thank you Hotaru. But you forgot who you are talking to. I can 
see through your masks. You don&#39;t have to smile if you don&#39;t feel 
like it.&quot;
 &quot;Don&#39;t you understand it ChibiUsa? I want to smile to make *you* 
smile. When I see your smile it always makes me feel better.&quot;
 Now a smile lit ChibiUsa&#39;s face also.
 &quot;Thank you ChibiUsa. Can I say it now?&quot;
 &quot;Go ahead.&quot;
 &quot;I will always love you ChibiUsa.&quot;
 &quot;And I will always love you Hotaru.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Midnight already passed when the two young women came to Hotaru&#39;s 
home. It was arranged that ChibiUsa would stay in the guest room in 
the Outer&#39;s mansion but everybody soon realized that they would 
spend the night in the same room.
 The girls quietly took off their shoes and went upstairs holding 
hands. They remained quiet when they were passing the halls until 
they reached the door to Hotaru&#39;s room. Hotaru reached for the 
doorknob but then she turned around with a question on her flushed 
face. They slept together all the time when they were younger. But 
now was different. Now they were in love.
 ChibiUsa simply smiled at Hotaru and nodded. No words were 
necessary, ChibiUsa knew what question was on Hotaru&#39;s mind. They 
entered the room and looked into each other&#39;s eyes. The most 
passionate kiss they ever shared followed. Their tongues danced 
with each other and explored each other&#39;s mouths. Their hands 
roamed across their bodies, studying the changes the years had 
brought. 
 Hotaru slipped her hand under ChibiUsa&#39;s dress and savored the 
feeling of the soft skin against her fingertips. She slowly moved 
her hands around ChibiUsa&#39;s back and began undressing her as 
ChibiUsa was doing the same. Soon, both were standing in their 
underwear and stockings.
 As Hotaru&#39;s dress fell on the floor, ChibiUsa went down on her 
Knees, and began slowly pulling off one of Hotaru&#39;s stockings. She 
would pull the stocking down a bit and kiss the soft skin she 
freed. Inside herself, Hotaru could feel something warm forming, 
and with every kiss ChibiUsa planted on her leg the feeling grew 
stronger. When ChibiUsa finally removed both stockings it was 
Hotaru&#39;s turn. Though Hotaru took a different approach. With her 
hands she was pulling down the stocking and her tongue traveled 
along a few inches behind the stocking. ChibiUsa let out a muttered 
moan as the delicate feeling of Hotaru&#39;s tongue against her skin 
washed through her body.
 After the stockings were off, Hotaru&#39;s bra was next. ChibiUsa 
unclasped it and let it fall to the floor. She gently cupped one of 
Hotaru&#39;s breasts with her hand and kissed the other&#39;s nipple 
lovingly. She began suckling on the nipple and stroking the other 
with her thumb. Hotaru&#39;s nipples were growing harder every second 
as ChibiUsa was playing with her breasts. They were already rock 
hard when ChibiUsa felt two hands encircle her face. Hotaru 
lovingly brought ChibiUsa&#39;s face in front of hers and kissed her 
passionately while she unclasped her bra.
 ChibiUsa saw desire in her lover&#39;s eyes, as Hotaru lowered her 
head to have some fun with ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts, which were slightly 
larger than her own. At the same time Hotaru put her hands on 
ChibiUsa&#39;s hips and lay her down on the bed. She took her position 
beside ChibiUsa and while teasing her nipples with her tongue she 
slid down ChibiUsa&#39;s panties. After the wet panties landed on the 
floor, Hotaru started planting a trail of kisses from ChibiUsa&#39;s 
breasts downward.
 The path led from one nipple through a valley to the other and 
then further downward across ChibiUsa&#39;s soft stomach. Hotaru was 
moving in circles around the navel and finally followed the musky 
scent to it&#39;s origin. Hotaru&#39;s lips reached a bush of pink hair and 
her fingers played a little with the pubic hair while her lips 
shyly touched the petals of ChibiUsa&#39;s sex. ChibiUsa let out a 
groan and a moan at the same time and Hotaru smiled to herself to 
her achievement.
 Determined to draw another moan from ChibiUsa, Hotaru changed her 
position. She put her knees down on either side of ChibiUsa&#39;s head, 
carefully avoiding her ponytails. Hotaru stretched over ChibiUsa&#39;s 
body and resumed the attack at her pussy.
 Suddenly, ChibiUsa was encircled with a sweet odor, and she 
slowly opened her eyes. She was greeted with a sight that 
immediately shattered all the walls inside her, and she let out a 
sound that Hotaru could only describe as something between a sigh 
and a moan. Two pillars were holding Hotaru&#39;s crotch mere inches 
away from ChibiUsa&#39;s face. ChibiUsa inhaled the strong scent deep 
inside and lifted her head to kiss the wet spot on the white 
panties above her.
 Hotaru was tasting the sweet juices that ran out of ChibiUsa&#39;s 
pussy when she felt two hands pulling down her panties. When 
ChibiUsa discarded Hotaru&#39;s panties and was engulfed by her 
Smell, she knew she wouldn&#39;t last much longer. The black haired 
girl felt ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue slowly lick her pussy.
 Hotaru knew ChibiUsa was close to her climax and so was she. Their 
breathing was shallow and quick. Moans, gasps and sighs were mixed 
with licking sounds. As if their minds were somehow connected, they 
inserted a finger into each other simultaneously and it was like 
floodgates were opened.
 After the climax passed, the lovers snuggled up to each to catch 
their breath for the next round.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Soft, smiling crimson eyes greeted Hotaru when she woke up. The 
small amount of light in her room told her that morning has long 
passed. 
 &quot;Hotaru-chan, wake up,&quot; a soft voice began.
 &#39;Hmph&#39; was the only response the voice got from the girl who 
pulled the blankets over her head.
 &quot;Hotaru-chan, I&#39;ll give you a kiss if you get up,&quot; the soft voice 
persisted.
 &quot;Why don&#39;t you get back in here and we can continue where we 
stopped last night.&quot;
 The softness in the voice disappeared as it started anew: &quot;Hotaru, 
don&#39;t you want to say goodbye? I&#39;ll be going soon.&quot;
 Crimson eyes met purple ones again when Hotaru removed the blanket 
from her face. Two hands grabbed the unprepared ChibiUsa as Hotaru 
pulled her closer to kiss her.
 &quot;Hotaru, how come you aren&#39;t sad?&quot; ChibiUsa asked when they 
finally broke their kiss.
 &quot;I am sad. But I know that our love is strong. I believe in our 
love. The princess, Usagi-chan, taught me to believe in love.&quot; 
Hotaru stated with certainty.
 After a pause the raven haired asked the question that lingered in 
her.
 &quot;ChibiUsa, this is the last time you came back, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
 A &#39;yes&#39; spoken underneath ChibiUsa&#39;s breath was all the answer she 
got.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 About half an hour later, a time portal opened in the back yard of 
the Outers&#39; house.
 &quot;I love you Tomoe Hotaru, princess of Saturn.&quot;
 &quot;I love you Tsukino Chibi Usagi, princess of the Moon.&quot; &lt;Thousand 
years is not a long time...&gt;
 A phrase kept repeating itself in ChibiUsa&#39;s mind like if she was 
chanting a mandala. A phrase which held all her hopes, all her 
dreams, her entire being.
 &lt;I believe in our love.&gt;
 And the light filled her.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you haven&#39;t noticed I borrowed a verse from Bob Dylan&#39;s Shelter 
from the Storm and various phrases from his songs.
Thank you for reading.
