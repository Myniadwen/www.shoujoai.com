<p>“So, what exactly seems to be the problem?” Toru asked as he  followed the young woman with the light blue hair and long  peach-colored coat to the tunnel of love. The neon light in front of  the ride had been turned off, and an “out of order” sign was draped  across the entrance to keep patrons out.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure,” Zultan  explained as she lifted the sign up for herself and Toru to duck under.  “As you know, the boats slide on a motorized track under the water  through the tunnel. For some reason, the track is not working properly  around the third bend in the tunnel. Here,” she said as she led him  into the dark tunnel and onto a small section of dry land alongside the  water, “Follow me and I’ll show you.”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>She  saw the two walk together into the tunnel of love, and her pulse  increased as she reached into her coat pocket and grabbed her henshin  wand. It was cold against her bare hand, and even as she reached the  out of order sign she hoped that she was wrong, that she wasn’t really  needed.</p>
<p>The man’s scream from inside the tunnel wiped out any  hope for Michiru. She grimaced as she clutched the wand until her  knuckles turned white, slowly walking into the dark tunnel and waiting  anxiously for her eyes to adjust to the lack of light. Once they did,  she crept up to the edge of where the tunnel curved to the right and  peered around the corner.</p>
<p>There were at least five boats stopped  in a row, each one carrying an unconscious couple slumped over  breathing heavily. On a small shoreline Toru lay on his back, a look of  pain and fear frozen on his face as his heart crystal floated above  him. Zultan stood a few feet away, coldly looking down at her victim as  he continued to groan.</p>
<p>Michiru had seen enough. She stepped back out of Zultan’s visual range and held up her wand. “Neptune planet power, Make Up!”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“Damn,” the witch grumbled. “Not a talisman. Still, the professor can still probably make some sort of use out of it…”</p>
<p>“Guided by a new eon, Sailor Neptune acts with grace.”</p>
<p>Zultan looked up and narrowed her eyes. “You again?”</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune leaped over to her, placing herself between Zultan and Toru.  “You shall not have his crystal,” she said as the crystal slowly  lowered back into the fair organizer’s chest, “Not today.”</p>
<p>“Maybe  not,” she said as she reached into her long coat and pulled out a gas  mask. “But then, you’ll not be interfering with me or my plans after  today again, either.” Flashing a remote control device, she quickly  pushed a button as she put her gas mask on. On the far wall of the  tunnel a panel opened in the faux rocky surface, revealing the familiar  car with its black five-pointed star painted on the driver’s door. Its  rear hatch opened up to reveal a large metallic box. As Zultan pressed  another button on the remote, the box opened, allowing a daemon to  escape.</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune stepped back as she caught sight of the  thing. It had a large bulbous head, with dark green and maroon bumps  covering its entire body. Clumps of moss and disgusting patches of  yellow algae seemed to ooze from its porous flesh, and instead of a  face it seemed to just have a single yellow-green blob where its eyes  should’ve been.</p>
<p>“Tripu, tripu,” it gurgled as it set its sites on the young Senshi.</p>
<p>“Get rid of this pest once and for all,” Zultan ordered as she ran towards one of the boats.</p>
<p>“Wait!” Neptune yelled as she started to follow.</p>
<p>“Tripu,  tripu,” the thing said again as a brown, foul-smelling gas was released  from its body. As Neptune began to cough on the noxious fumes, the  witch hopped off the boat she'd jumped onto and off to the opposite  shore, pressing one more button on her remote before jumping into her  car and making her escape through a secret passage that opened just  long enough for her to drive through before it closed again behind her.</p>
<p>“Breathe in, tripu,” the thing hissed as more fumes were released, “Loose yourself, give in to the colors.”</p>
<p>Neptune’s  eyes began to burn, and as she continued to cough and her nose started  to run, multi-colored strobe lights began flashing within the cave as  very loud music started playing out of hidden stereos within the walls.  As Sailor Neptune opened her eyes to try to focus on what was going on  around her, she saw the walls starting to melt and run into the river  in front of her.</p>
<p><em>Please allow me to introduce myself<br />
  </em><em>I’m a man of wealth and taste<br />
  </em><em>I’ve been around for a long, long year<br />
</em><em>Stole many a man’s soul and faith</em></p>
<p>Neptune did more than see the lights and hear the music that Zultan had turned on with her remote; she could <em>hear</em> the colors coming from the strobe lights. Red was the loudest, while  yellow had a nasally quality to it, and the purple sounded like  breaking glass.</p>
<p><em>And I was there when Jesus Christ<br />
  </em><em>Had his moment of doubt and pain<br />
  </em><em>Made damn sure that Pilate<br />
</em><em>Washed his hands and sealed his fate</em></p>
<p>“Give in, tripu,” the thing slurred out as it began to move forward, “Don’t fight it.”</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune looked around frantically at the others in the tunnel. Toru now  looked like an origami man made out of brownish orange paper. The  various couples still unconscious in their boats suddenly had insect  heads, with one even seeming to be busy wrapping itself up into a  cocoon.</p>
<p><em>Pleased to meet you<br />
  </em><em>Hope you guess my name<br />
  </em><em>But what’s puzzling you<br />
</em><em>Is just the nature of my game</em></p>
<p>Neptune  couldn’t think clearly, not between the music, the lights and the  horrifying images she was seeing. Her heart was pounding as she looked  back at the part of the cave she’d just come from, only to see that it  had turned into the jaws of a great black snake.</p>
<p><em>I stuck around St. Petersburg<br />
  When I saw it was a time for a change<br />
  Killed the czar and his ministers<br />
  Anastasia screamed in vain</em></p>
<p>Her  lower jaw quivered, and as the youma came ever closer she covered her  ears and screamed, watching as her scream flowed out her mouth in  bright neon blue dayglow letters.</p>
<p>“<em>Trust in your growing psychic powers. They will alert you to when Sailor Neptune is needed, and will help you to survive.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Neptune’s eyes widened as she remembered Pluto’s words. Closing her eyes, she desperately tried to reach out with her mind.</p>
<p><em>I rode a tank<br />
  Held a general's rank<br />
  When the blitzkrieg raged<br />
  And the bodies stank</em></p>
<p>“Illusions,”  she whispered. Opening her eyes again, she now understood that the  youma’s gas was causing her to experience the strange hallucinations.  She needed to get out of the tunnel, to get somewhere where she could  breath and try to fight the effects of the daemon’s attack.</p>
<p><em>Pleased to meet you<br />
</em><em>Hope you guessed my name</em></p>
<p>“Deep Submerge!” she screamed, sending the attack into the ceiling, “Deep Submerge!”</p>
<p>The  two attacks had the desired effect of blowing a hole in the ceiling of  the ride. As the caustic brown smoke started to billow out and the  music and lights continued on, Sailor Neptune jumped out of the ceiling  just before the youma reached her.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Miyuki  looked at her watch and sighed. “I’ll be right back,” she mumbled,  remembering Michiru's words. She never meant to scare her freshman  charge off like that. Truth was, she’d been experiencing confused  feelings for Michiru for close to a month now, ever since the library  incident. The comment just came out without her thinking about it. If  she could take the comment back, she would, but…</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-KA- BOOM!-</strong></p>
<p>The  junior nearly jumped out of her skin at the loud explosion. It seemed  to come from the tunnel of love. Miyuki remembered with a sinking  feeling that Michiru had gone off in that direction, and began to run  past startled parents and children towards the closed amusement  attraction.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>-KA-BOOM!-</strong></p>
<p>This time the  sky seemed to light up with a bright blue flash, as if someone had set  off fireworks. As Miyuki caught Takayo and Chieko out of the corner of  her eye, black smoke started to billow out of the top of the ride and a  strange-looking girl emerged wearing a tiara and a bright aqua-green  sailor themed costume.</p>
<p>“Look,” a girl cried out, “They must be putting on some sort of kids show.”</p>
<p>Parents  and children suddenly came crowding foreward to see the show as Takayo  made her way to Miyuki. “What’s going on? Are they filming an episode  of Kamen Rider?”</p>
<p>Miyuki shook her head, “I don’t think so,” she  said thoughtfully as the girl in the strange dress began frantically  running away from the rising pillar of smoke, “That doesn’t look like  any costume from Super Sentai either.”</p>
<p>“Might be a new show,”  Chieko suggested as she came over. A monster now emerged from the black  smoke, some kids booing it while others simply laughed and clapped at  the fun entertainment being offered for their amusement.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>“Trying  to escape, tripu?” the thing asked as it leaped out of the hole after  Sailor Neptune, “Silly girl, there is no escape, tripu, tripu…”</p>
<p>Neptune closed her eyes and rubbed them as she continued to cough.</p>
<p>“No escape…”</p>
<p align="center">-</p>
<p><em>She  opened her eyes to find herself in the burning kingdom from her dream  again, the pain from her injuries once more causing her to double over  in pain.</em><em> In front of her stood Pluto, a look of grim determination in her face. “You cannot escape your duty,” she said authoritatively.</em></p>
<p>“<em>We know our duty, Pluto-sama,” a strangely familiar voice yelled out, “Our duty is to die defending Serenity.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>It’s  too late for that,” Pluto said, “The princess is already dead, as is  Endymion. The queen herself has given the word. We must leave the field  of battle to awaken the Senshi of Silence.”</em></p>
<p><em>Neptune tried  to turn her head to see the other speaker, but instead of the blonde  from the first dream she now saw a woman with red hair and a maniacal  grin floating in the air in front of her, laughing.</em></p>
<p align="center">-</p>
<p>“You dare laugh at this, Beryl?”</p>
<p>The youma stopped and seemed to tilt its head in puzzlement. “Tripu?”</p>
<p>“You’ve  destroyed the kingdom,” Sailor Neptune shouted at the daemon as she  shook with rage, “You’ve murdered the royals and the princess’  guardians, thinking yourself greater than Serenity herself. But victory  shall not be yours. Not now, not <strong>ever!</strong>”</p>
<p>“Tripu, <em>what</em>? Wait, I…”</p>
<p>“Deep  Submerge!” she screamed, sending the attack at the youma with all her  might. The thing let out a shrill scream before dissolving into a clump  of poisonous mushrooms, a small pod slowly popping out of it before  crumbling to dust.</p>
<p>The burning palace dissapeared as Sailor  Neptune sunk to her knees, coughing and gasping for air while the  brownish-black smoke from the tunnel of love finally dissipated out  into the air. As she sat back on her legs, she became aware of a loud  noise to her left. Looking down from the roof, she could see a large  group of kids and parents clapping and cheering enthusiastically now  that the “show” was over and the hero had won.</p>
<p>Neptune stood up,  brushed her bangs back with her hand and leapt into the air, landing  behind the ride. “Did you see that?” she faintly heard one boy say, “I  couldn’t even see any wires!”</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>After a few  minutes, the crowd slowly started to thin out. As a group of security  guards were called over to the tunnel of love to investigate the  insident, Takayo saw a familiar face coming over. “Michiru-chan, where  have you been?” she asked, putting her hands on her hips as she readied  herself to scold her roommate, “You missed everything, you…  Michiru-chan?” she asked as she got a better look at the other girl,  “Are you alright? You don’t look so good.”</p>
<p>“Michiru-chan,” Miyuki  said with concern as she saw the girl’s blood-shot eyes and put her  hand to the girl's forehead, “You feel clammy. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“I-  I think- That I- I…” she didn’t get to complete the sentence before  rushing away from her sempai and towards the nearest trash can. Leaning  over it, she let go and threw up.</p>
<p>A short time later, Takayo,  Chieko and a very worried Miyuki brought Michiru to the first aid  station. Her three classmen were told to stay in the waiting area as  she was quickly escorted into an examination room where a nurse with  long hair was already waiting with her back turned.</p>
<p>“We have a  very sick school girl here,” the receptionist said at the door,  “Possible smoke inhilation from that whole kids’ show thing over at the  tunnel of love, and what looks like symptoms of food poisoning.”</p>
<p>“Yes,  thank you,” the nurse said, “I’ll take over from here.” As the  receptionist left the examination room and shut the door behind her,  the nurse turned around. “Hello again, Michiru-san.”</p>
<p>Michiru’s eyes widened in surprise. “P- Pluto-sama!”</p>
