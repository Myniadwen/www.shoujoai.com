<p>The two girls slipped quietly into the darkened dorm room hand in  hand. They would be alone for a bit, and they could take their time. As  their lips came together, the taller girl cradled the shorter girl's  cheeks in her hands. Soon, the older girl had the younger pushed up  against the wall. Her hands began to wander, her excitement growing as  she suckled on an earlobe and the shorter girl began to moan. She  slowly began to hike up the other girl's skirt, when unexpectedly a  hand stopped her.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru?&quot; she asked in confusion as her girlfriend pulled back from her.</p>
<p>Michiru  looked down at her feet as she avoided eye contact with her sempai.  &quot;I'm sorry, I... I'm not feeling good, I need to be alone for a bit.&quot;</p>
<p>Miyuki stepped back. &quot;Not feeling good? Wha... You were feeling fine earlier today during the rehearsals. What's really wrong?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  continued to avoid eye contact as she bit her lip. Finally, Miyuki let  out a sigh. &quot;Very well, I'll get going. Just promise me you'll tell me  later what was wrong, okay?&quot; She turned and left, leaving Michiru still  shaking a bit as she leaned against the wall.</p>
<p>The young artist  closed her eyes and drew in a sharp breath. She pushed her long bangs  away from her eyes with the edge of her hand. She had to look, had to  see the face. And now that she had, she was lost. All she could see was  that face, all she could hear was that voice. It called out to her  soul, and it whispered of deeds and promises long forgotten. Her heart  was being torn in two, between a choice of a comfortable future as a  musician and an uncertain and dangerous fate of going back to being  Sailor Neptune and trying to awaken Uranus.</p>
<p>She was drawn from  her thoughts by a knock at the door, followed by Takayo and Elsa coming  in. &quot;Hey Michiru-chan,&quot; her roommate said with a smile, &quot;The two of us  were going to stay up for a bit, play cards and talk. You know, have a  real slumber party. You want in?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, but no,&quot; Michiru  answered as she pushed herself from the wall and started to head for  the door, &quot;I don't do slumber parties.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Suit yourself,&quot; Takayo  answered with a shrug. &quot;So Elsa, you ran in this Fall's inter-school  track event back in September, how badly did you beat everyone?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't&quot; Elsa answered as Michiru reached the door, &quot;I came in second.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Second?&quot; Takayo asked as the doorknob was turned, &quot;I thought nobody could beat you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Try telling that to Tenoh Haruka.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru stopped.</p>
<p>&quot;Tenoh Haruka? Is she fast?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You could say that,&quot; Elsa answered with a chuckle, &quot;She's the first person I've gone against who I couldn't beat.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;On  the other hand,&quot; Michiru said as she shut the door and came back into  the room, &quot;I have heard that slumber parties are supposed to be fun,  ne? And just because I've never been to one before doesn't mean I can't  start now, does it?&quot;</p>
<p>Elsa and Takayo looked at each other, then at Michiru. &quot;Well,&quot; Takayo said, &quot;If you're sure you'd like to...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Wonderful,&quot; Michiru interrupted with a smile. &quot;So, Elsa-chan, tell me more about this Haruka girl you raced against.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The  rented theater was empty as she stole back into the balcony. Lighting  up a cigarette and wearing a backpack, Zultan picked the large box up  again and dragged it to the giant spotlight. She squatted down between  the spotlight and the box, pulling out a flask of whiskey as she did  so. She flicked the ashes onto the red carpeted floor as she took a  swig before removing her backpack.</p>
<p>The professor was getting  paranoid, that's all she could think of as she looked over to the heavy  box. There was no way in hell that Sailor Neptune could've survived the  daemon at the fair. Indeed, there'd been no sightings whatsoever of the  girl since she'd left her in the tunnel of love with the hallucinogenic  youma. The daemon in the box was superfluous; who did he think she was  going to need protection from now? A group of parents, their bratty  parents, or the nuns who were supposed to be watching them?</p>
<p>She  put the cigarette back in her lips and held it there with her teeth as  she used both hands to hook up the device from her backpack to the  large spotlight, grumbling in annoyance as she had to use a  three-pronged adapter at one point to finish the job. Finally  satisfied, she snuck out as noiselessly as she'd snuck in, a malicious  smile gracing her lips.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p><em>She was  showing off her new convertible to Hironari, bragging about how it was  left to her by her aunt and discussing what kind of body work would be  necessary to fix the car up, when a strange scent reached her nostrils.  She closed her eyes briefly as she inhaled, musing that it smelled of  the sea and of romance. Opening her eyes, she saw a shadowy figure  standing outside the garage staring at her in the snow. She was used to  having cute and not so cute girls following her from afar, and she'd  gotten into the habit of flirting at her admirers with a wink, a smirk,  or a look through half-closed eyelids.</em></p>
<p><em>She did none of  those things now though. Instead, she simply looked back, trying to see  through the shadows and steal a glimpse of the girl who smelled of the  ocean.</em></p>
<p><em>The oceans of being...</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka's eyes  widened as there was a bright sea green flash of light, carrying with  it warmth and a sense of familiarity. As the light faded, the girl was  still there in the shadows, but now the sky was a crimson red. The  figure turned and began to walk away just as a large blackness began to  suck buildings and people into itself. Instead of running away from the  monstrous thing though, the petite figure was walking towards it.</em></p>
<p><em>A  sudden sense of protectiveness took possession of Haruka. She pushed  herself off from the car hood she'd been leaning up against and began  to run out of the garage towards the girl, heedless of her own danger.  She seemed to be running in slow motion though, unable to reach her as  the black curtain of death came closer and closer.</em></p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Haruka  woke up with a start, panting as sweat rolled down her forehead. She  sat up in bed and brought her knees up to her chest, trying to calm  down. Two nights now she'd had a nightmare about the end of the world,  and tonight she'd dreamed of the girl she'd only caught a glimpse of  from the garage door. She didn't even get a good look at her, how could  she have made such an impression?</p>
<p>&quot;Heh,&quot; she chuckled nervously to herself, &quot;At least I'll have something good to share with the school psychologist next time.&quot;</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>The  next day, the theater was full of parents and small children. Michiru  looked out from behind the curtain, feeling her nerves acting up. She  was no actor. How in the world did she get talked into this?</p>
<p>More importantly, was <em>she</em> in the crowd?</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-san.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai?&quot;  Michiru turned around to see her mother's long-time personal assistant  Kotono Morino. &quot;Let me guess, you're here to explain to me why my  mother won't be here tonight, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I... That is...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's  alright, really,&quot; Michiru said with a sad smile. &quot;If I remember  correctly, this is her anniversary isn't it? How are she and her third  husband doing?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Very well, but she wanted you to know that she'd be here if she could.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Michiru responded with a forced civility. &quot;Tell her I understand. Will you be staying for the show?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai,&quot; Kotono answered as she held up a small camcorder, &quot;Your mom made me promise to tape everything for her.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  looked at the camcorder and smiled. &quot;That's my mom,&quot; she murmured.  Looking back to the personal assistant, she nodded. &quot;Where will you be  sitting?&quot; she asked as she put on her brown wig to play the title  character.</p>
<p>&quot;Front and center,&quot; Kotono answered, &quot;Break a leg.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Arigato,&quot;  she said as the older woman left and she turned back to look out from  behind the curtain again. Her mind drifted back to last night's slumber  party, and to what Elsa Gray shared with her about Haruka. The girl had  always been a natural athlete, came from a well to do background, and  tended to keep to herself. She'd cut her hair short and started  dressing like a boy a little over a month ago, and the rumor was that  she was into girls (Michiru could still remember Takayo laughing out  loud and squealing &quot;Ewww!&quot; when she'd heard that little tidbit).</p>
<p>What  struck Michiru most though was Elsa's comment about Haruka as a runner.  When Takayo asked her why she hadn't beaten her in a race yet, Elsa  just shook her head. &quot;Trying to outrace her is like trying to catch the  wind.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Who are you looking for Michiru-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru turned to see Miyuki standing behind her holding onto several chains. &quot;Oh, I didn't hear you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sure,&quot; Miyuki murmured.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing. Here, I have to help you get into these chains. By the way, just what did happen yesterday?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday?&quot; Michiru asked, looking around as her fellow actors started to get in place.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  yesterday,&quot; Miyuki said as she locked Michiru's hands and feet into  shackles and began wrapping chains around her. &quot;You were fine right up  until we went with your roommate and her friend to dinner, then...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miyuki, this is hardly the time or place to... Oof,&quot; she grunted as the junior pulled one of the chains a little too snugly.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry,&quot; Miyuki said. &quot;But it's just that you've never come down with headaches before yesterday...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I  didn't say I had a headache, I...&quot; she grimaced as the chains were  again tightened, &quot;I said I wasn't feeling well. Please don't make a  scene.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Make a scene?&quot; Miyuki asked indignantly as she padlocked  all the chains in place. &quot;Fine Michiru. Tell you what, it's obvious you  want some sort of space, so I'm leaving. I've already seen enough play  rehearsals to be able to quote it with my eyes closed anyways.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Miyuki...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But  this isn't over,&quot; she said loud enough to get the attention of some of  the others behind the curtain. &quot;After the play, we will discuss this  further Michiru,&quot; she said before leaving through the exit and storming  out of the theater.</p>
<p>Michiru frowned. She never meant to hurt  Miyuki's feelings or upset her. Looking down, she realized that her  sempai had her shackled so tightly that she could just manage to  shuffle her feet, but her hands were almost completely immobile. She  closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She had to forget her  relationship problems and try to focus on remembering her lines. She  could suddenly feel anxiety. Strange, she'd never suffered stage fright  playing her violin.</p>
<p>Her anxiety began to turn into fear, and she  could feel her pulse begin to pick up. She opened her eyes and saw  that, while some of the others were also looking a bit nervous, no one  else was having an anxiety attack. Her hands began to shake as Takayo  and the other girl playing guards came forward, each taking a chain in  hand as the orchestra began to play. As the curtain began to open, she  could hear the waves crashing.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Zultan  heard the overture begin. It was time. Reaching into her backpack, she  pulled out the large black star decail and stuck it to the front of the  spotlight. As the curtain began to open, she took aim...</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;It's magic time!&quot; Takayo said enthusiastically as she and the other girl began to lead Michiru out.</p>
<p>&quot;No, wait!&quot; Michiru screamed. &quot;Close the curtain, cancel the show!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; the other guard asked in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru,&quot; Takayo said as some of the other actresses already on stage gave nervous looks their way, &quot;Get a hold of yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No,  Takayo!&quot; Michiru pleaded frantically, her eyes wide with fear as the  tsunami picked up power inside her head. She was pulled by the two  guards onto the stage, the crowd thinking her show of fear part of the  play. &quot;You have to listen!&quot;</p>
<p>That's when the spotlight came on.</p>
<p>Barely  able to move, Michiru dived down, landing hard on her chest and  knocking the wind out of herself. Takayo and the other guard were both  hit, collapsing down to the stage floor as their heart crystals were  extracted. Three of the actresses in the council were next, each  screaming out in pain as the spotlight shone on them.</p>
<p>Panic  spread throughout the audience as parents and students rushed for the  exits, only to find them locked. As those closest to the exit doors  began to be crushed against them, Zultan shone the light on them.  Screams of fear and pain filled the auditorium as men, women and  children collapsed, their heart crystals floating in the air just above  them.</p>
<p>Michiru meanwhile struggled to wiggle out from beneath  Takayo who'd landed on her legs. She freed herself, but managed in the  process to attract Zultan's attention. The violinist began desperately  rolling on her side towards the back stage area behind the heavy stage  curtain, the spotlight just missing her as she reached safety.  Frowning, Zultan turned her attention back to the crowd, continuing to  hit people with her spotlight until the screams and frightened shouts  at last died away.</p>
<p>&quot;Shit,&quot; the witch grumbled as she looked out  at the glowing sea of heart crystals, &quot;I would've thought for sure  there'd be a talisman somewhere in a group this size. Hey, little  girl,&quot; she called down from the balcony as she lit another cigarette,  &quot;Hey 'Joan,' come on out.&quot; Michiru lay on her side behind the stage  struggling futilely to escape her chains as Zultan frowned. &quot;Come on,  let's not waste both our time.&quot;</p>
<p>When nothing happened, the witch  finally shrugged. &quot;Fine, you brought it on yourself.&quot; She opened the  metal box. Instantly, dozens upon dozens of black snakes escaped and  slithered out off the balcony and down to the auditorium floor. There,  they began to slither together to morph into the shape of one large  black viper, its glowing yellow-green eyes focused on the stage as it  began to slither down the aisle and over fallen audience members  towards its intended target.</p>
