<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 1 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A young General by the name of Jayton walked happily down the lavishly 
decorated hallways. Knowing the person awaiting this information will 
be pleased. He stopped at a pair of large black doors. Chiseled in was 
the sign of their home. General Jayton knocked on the large doors and 
went in when he was permitted.

Jayton walked down the short hallway to the living area. What he faced 
was probably the most gorgeous creature in the universe! Every man 
praised her beauty. The young woman had long silver-chestnut hair that 
swept to her knees. Her eyes were large and brown , decorated with the 
same color as her dress. She wore a straight neck-line gown, showing 
her perfectly tanned shoulders. The arms puffed lightly at the 
forearm, then split medieval style. It had an empire waist and panned 
out lightly around her in all it&#146;s ever-green glory. ( long 
description I know..oh well a lot of the descriptions will be like 
that. Live!) The young woman turned around to speak.

&#147; Good evening General Jayton, hopefully you have brought me good 
news?&#148;

&#147; Yes Princess, I have very good news.&#148;

&#147; Great! Tell me.&#148;

&#147; We&#146;ve found him Princess, you were correct he was on Earth.&#148;

&#147;Wonderful! Jayton, tell them to get the ship ready , then send Menia 
to come and get me when were ready to leave.&#148;

&#147; Yes Princess, but what about&#133;&#148;

&#147; All living arrangements &amp; transportation is left to me. Now go.&#148;

&#147; Yes your Highness.&#148;

With that the General left off to the docking bay and the Princess 
went to her bedroom.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rei sighed looking out the window. A perfectly normal day, waiting for 
her friends at the Crown Caf&eacute;. Why isn&#146;t life going well for her? Sure 
Rei had looks, talent and almost everything going for her. But what&#146;s 
it all matter with out love? Rei could tell that soon Ami and Lita 
would be a couple. All her friends had a girlfriend or boyfriend. Even 
Setsuna, who&#146;s immortal life had been lonely, fell in love with the 
Love Goddess herself. The one she wanted was untouchable. 

- All but me have someone- she thought

To top it off, Rei could sense something or someone coming and a new 
battle would follow behind. She was snapped from her revere when she 
noticed Serena&#146;s hand in front of her face.

&#147;Hey space cadet! What were you doing? Visiting your home planet?&#148; 
Serena laughed at her dazed friend.

&#147; Sorry Sere, I was thinking. Where is everyone?&#148;

&#147; Oh, they&#146;ll be here soon. That is if they don&#146;t want to be late for 
the move. Darien&#146;s over talking to Andrew.&#148;

&#147; I see.&#148; - I don&#146;t really care where Darien is-

They sat and talked about school and such while the others arrived. 
Two by two they arrived, Amara &amp;Michelle, Lita &amp;Ami, and then Setsuna 
&amp;Mina. Hotaru was at a friends house since she couldn&#146;t see a R rated 
movie yet. Then they all left, including Andrew.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next day

&#147; Princess we are prepared to land in ten minutes.&#148;

&#147; Thank you Captain Zowarek. Set the ship on auto landing and have the 
crew change into Earth&#146;s clothing.&#148;

&#147; Yes your Highness.&#148;

The Princess then left to change herself.

- Now what to wear&#133; Freedom from those dresses! Aaaaaahhhh&#133;&#133;this will 
do.-

The young woman changed into a light blue tank top, a green over 
jacket (think dress shirt), and flare jeans. She kept her long hair 
down and put on a pair of sunglasses. &#147; Perfect&#148; was all she said when 
Menia came to get her.

&#147; Come on in Menia.&#148; She called

&#147; Terrestria, we&#146;ve landed. It&#146;s time to set up the living 
arrangements and such.&#148;

&#147; Of course, I&#146;m coming.&#148;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

They landed on Stars Hill. The perfect place to set up. Princess 
Terrestria took a small model of a mansion and placed it in a nice 
spot. She stepped back, raised her hand, and the model grew to full 
scale.

&#147; Good now that were set up, Jayton and I will go to the Crown Caf&eacute; 
and invite everyone for the week. Here on Earth you are to call me 
Terri. Be careful not to refer to me as &#146;Princess&#146; unless I say it&#146;s 
safe. Prepare the Mansion for our guests please.&#146;&#146; Everyone murmured a 
&#147; yes Miss Terri&#148; and went inside. Except for Jayton who followed 
Terrestria to the garage to pick out a car.

&#147; Okay Jayton we&#146;re taking the Mustang Convertible, so hop in!&#148;

&#147; You know how to drive this thing?&#148;

&#147; Of course, now lets go. I don&#146;t wanna be late.&#148;

On the way to the Crown, Terri filled General Jayton in on how things 
were going to work. She told him her Earth name was Terri Shields, a 
major fashion designer. He was Jason Avery, her personal bodyguard. 
When they arrived at the Crown, Terri Shields walked in. Jason right 
behind her. They sat at the counter waiting for &#145;him&#146; to arrive. 

&#147; So what would you like?&#148; Andrew asked the two.

&#147; Ummm&#133;two cokes please.&#148; Terri answered.

&#147; OK&#148;

Three minutes later Andrew had their drinks.

&#147; What&#146;s your name? I&#146;ve never seen you two in here before.&#148;

&#147; My name is Terri Shields, this is my bodyguard Jason Avery.&#148;

&#147; Terri Shields&#133;.the fashion designer?&#148; Andrew asked. Terri merely 
nodded yes.

&#147; You know you have the same last name as Darien. In fact here he 
comes now&#148;

- Finally- she thought

Darien came in and sat next to Terri, with Serena on the other side. 
Lita, Ami, Mina and Rei coming in afterwards.

&#147; Hey Andrew! Anything new? Darien asked.

&#147; Actually yes, the young lady next to you as the same last name as 
yours.&#148; Andrew replied. Darien turned his head to look at the person 
next to him.

&#147; Is this true?&#148; Rei asked stepping closer. Terri stopped drinking her 
coke and looked at the group. 

&#147; Yes, my name is Terri Shields. This is my bodyguard Jason Avery.&#148;

Everyone said hello.

&#147; How is that possible? I&#145;m the last Shields.&#148; Darien was definitely 
confused.

&#147; Simple, I&#146;m your sister Darien.&#148; Terri replied coolly.

A gasp was heard from everyone but Rei.

&#147; I know your confused, so I&#146;m inviting you all to my mansion for a 
week. I know you 5 are on summer brake from college and Darien I&#146;ve 
called your office. Make sure to bring a bathing suite.&#148; With that 
Terri and Jason left them all shocked and excited

- Everything according to plan- Terri smiled to herself as she let 
&#146;Jason&#146; drive. 

- I am such a genius! - ( Andrew didn&#146;t hear their conversation. He 
went away alright? K!)

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A/N: Well? Love it, hate it? Feed back please! Anything is welcome, 
even flames. They&#146;ll warm my feet! Yes I know the sister thing is 
verrrry over done, but it was the only way to make this work. Besides 
the ending is different the any other I&#146;ve read.
