<p>Minako took a deep  breath, and then bore a look that connected soul to soul. “I need  your help, Rei. No, rather I should say, I need the help of Mars  Reiko. Without her... the Aino Minako of today will be lost.”</p>
<p>A thousand and one  emotions barreled through Rei's mind at those words, so quickly that  Minako could only catch the three that kept popping up. Hurt,  Indignation, and Anger. Following the course of the latter, she stood  up, glowering. “Is that all you came for? To use me until you have  the opportunity to leave me again? Forget it.”</p>
<p>She turned to  leave. She had expected a word, a hand on hers, to stop her, but no.  A moment too late, hands wrapped around her waist, holding her to  that warm body that she had missed for all those years, the body that  she had rarely held even then. Instead of a single word, a torrent of  them came to soothe her anger and keep her rooted to her spot.</p>
<p>“That's not it!” Minako winced as  Rei struggled a little, not expecting to get out, nor wanting to, but  believing it would have been foolhardy to not at least put up the  sense of having tried. “Rei... Rei...” Minako choked on nothing,  suddenly finding it so hard to say out loud what she had practiced so  many times in the comfort of her own hotel room. But it had to be  said. It could very well be a do or die situation if she couldn't get  Rei's help now. But it had to all be true, or Rei would never trust  her again, let alone do her huge favors.</p>
<p>Rei was getting  edgy, though she was trying as hard as she could to fight off the  urge to storm off. She knew she was stronger than Mina. She knew she  could throw her off if she <em>really</em> wanted to. But a part of  her, a strong part of her, didn't want to run away from the face it  had been missing for so many years. It was that part of her that  weakened her struggles to that of a newborn child, helpless to do  anything but listen.</p>
<p>“Rei... you... I can't tell you how  much your support has meant to me... ever since we met. When I was  away from you... it was the thought of what you would say if I  failed, that I found the strength to succeed. And when I'm with  you... even when it's just hearing your voice on the phone... all my  worries wash away, and I can perform again having had an easy sleep.  I need you in my life... and these past few years... I've been trying  so hard to find a way back... but my manager kept me on the places  where the fan bases weren't so high yet but held potential... kept  delaying my return, claiming that it would mean more to my fans here  if I came back after being a huge international success... And I  couldn't quit, couldn't refuse, because... because my fans give me  energy too. They spent their money to see me perform, and I feel a  sense of... voluntary duty to meet their standards. And I do love  them. Love all of them and their support. But...</p>
<p>“But they could never replace having <em>your</em> support. Compared to you, none of them, none of the fame,  none of the glory... is worth much of anything. I <em>need</em> you so  much... I was just about to give up any hope... when my manager gave  me a reluctant ultimatum. My... my popularity has actually been  dropping off a lot in Japan, though the same strong fans will always  support me and have been watching me from afar. So my manager said...  he said...” Minako bit her lip to keep it from happening, but in  vain. Rei felt the single tear fall on her shoulder. “I don't <em>want</em> to 'use' you like this, trust me, I don't, Rei! But... but... My  manager said I could come to Japan only on the condition that it was  to rejuvenate my career by changing it into a... a duet. Having a  partner to bounce chemistry off with, to interest fans. And who...  who better to reflect a sort of chemistry... than my dear old friend,  Rei? Rei, who has such a beautiful voice, that no one would mind the  details? Please say you'll consider it, Rei. Let us partner up again,  like the old times.”</p>
<p>Rei went into a  stunned, limp silence. Minako rested her cheek on Rei's shoulder,  relishing the feel of her body in case she didn't get a chance to  again anytime soon.</p>
<p>“What happens if I refuse?”</p>
<p>A cold chill went  through Minako. <em>Calm down, Minako, she hasn't told you NO yet...  but you have to play your cards right...</em> “Any number of things.  My manager might find me a different partner, someone I might grow to  like, but not likely immediately. My manager might make me go on tour  again, finding another solution. I might drain this lifestyle for all  it's worth until I sink into the abyss of oblivion and history. I  might choose to end this here and now... and stay near you... living  a relatively normal life. Or...”</p>
<p>“I like that option.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Rei turned to face  Minako, now that her grip was loose. “Why <em>can't </em>you end this  now? You've been gone for six years! Your name is known in every  huge, mass populated country across the globe! You should have enough  money to retire <em>twice</em> and still live with above average  comfort. Minako... why <em>can't</em> you give this lifestyle up now?”</p>
<p>Minako stared out  of focus at Rei for a long moment, before settling and giving Rei one  of the most lonesome, heart wrenching smiles she had ever seen. Like <em>she</em> would be the reason for another half a dozen years of  unhappiness. “Rei... I can't. My heart won't let me. I love the  stage, I love singing too much. As long as I have a voice to sing  with, and an audience to enjoy it, I will sing. And being an  international idol helps spread it much faster. But I can't take the  loneliness of it all anymore. No, perhaps I never could in the first  place.”</p>
<p>“I don't want to see you hurt  anymore.” Rei had lost count of the times she had listened to  Minako greet her on the phone, overridden with exhaustion and  overwork.</p>
<p>Minako, for all its  truth, tried to take advantage of the statement, with a simple one of  her own. “What hurts me most... is to not have both my singing...  and your constant companionship.” Deciding it could use some  elaboration, Minako added, “Each has one half of my heart... and  without either one... the other suffers.”</p>
<p>Rei looked away.  “Can't you compromise? Can't you stick to only Japan... can't we  just hang out more?”</p>
<p>“My career will dwindle fast if I not  only stay in one spot, but I do so alone, with the same image I've  had for six years.”</p>
<p>“Then let it dwindle.”</p>
<p>“Rei...!”</p>
<p>She winced. “I'm  sorry, I know I must sound selfish- but so are you! You can't have  both Mina! You just <em>can't</em>. I need to stay here. I'm a shrine  maiden, and there are people that depend on me to be consistent.  Someone like me is not fit for the lights of the stage anyway.”</p>
<p>“Someone like-” Mina stopped  knowing how Rei had really meant it. She sighed. “Rei...”</p>
<p>“Usagi would love it if you could  just stay too.”</p>
<p>Minako winced,  wishing she hadn't been reminded of her biggest fan. It made staying  resilient even harder. “If I can't, I can't.”</p>
<p>“If I can't, I can't,” Rei repeated  quietly. She turned away again, but did not attempt to walk away. And  Minako didn't attempt to grasp her again. Not yet.</p>
<p>It was silent  between them.</p>
<p>“Will you leave again?”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to?”</p>
<p>Rei snorted. “I  want you to be happy, but not if the grander part of my happiness  must be compromised to make it so.”</p>
<p>“Do you think... I would be happy...  leaving again?”</p>
<p>“Are you seriously asking me this?”</p>
<p>“As a friend, yes.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed. If she  really wanted to know... “Finding happiness with someone you  love... whether it's a romantic sort of love or not... can happen  anywhere at any time. But to have that... you need to be with that  person, if not in body, then completely in spirit, for it to work.  You can't do that if you're halfway across the world singing your  mental health away.”</p>
<p>“It's not <em>that</em> taxing.”</p>
<p>“Isn't it?” Rei seemed genuinely  unconvinced, and Minako couldn't find the energy to refute further.</p>
<p>They were silent  again.</p>
<p>Rei looked up at  the brisk autumn moon. It was getting cold...</p>
<p>“Where are you staying?”</p>
<p>Mina bolted out of  her silent trance. “Hnh? Oh, you know, I have my suite in one of  the hotels...”</p>
<p>“Your manager isn't worried about you  being out and about?”</p>
<p>“I told him where I was. I also told  him... I didn't expect to be back tonight.”</p>
<p>Rei twirled  smoothly to face Minako. A bit harsher than she had intended, Rei  asked, “Did you assume I'll let you stay over, no matter what my  response was?”</p>
<p>Minako winced, not  wanting to say one or the other.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Rei looked like she  was about to say anything, but gave up after a moment of failure.</p>
<p>More silence.</p>
<p>Just as Minako was  becoming truly uncomfortable, Rei turned away a final time.</p>
<p>“If it'll satisfy your manager...  tell him that I'll <em>consider</em> your offer...”</p>
<p>Minako's head  bolted up, staring at Rei's bag with untold surprise and barely  contained happiness. “Rei...!”</p>
<p>“BUT! Minako,” Rei's voice grew  dangerously low, “If you think you have a snowball's chance in hell  of convincing me to go into the music industry with you like that...  you're seriously deluding yourself.”</p>
<p>With the snap of her fingers, Rei had  completely turned a happy moment into a hopeless one.</p>
<p>“Come on inside, it's getting cold.  Partner or not, I don't want to be held liable for a sick singer.  Besides, we can talk of better things while you stay over tonight.”</p>
