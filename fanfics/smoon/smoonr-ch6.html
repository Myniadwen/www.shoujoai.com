New Mission, New Target; Seiya&#146;s New Game 

&#147;Kado I am extremely disappointed with your efforts to capture Love 
Crystals.&#148; Prince Kaori said. &#147;I know my prince, but please, give me 
one more chance.&#148; 

&#147;Fine, I want you to find and capture Sailor Star Fighter she is of 
great deal to me and will aid us in our search.&#148; 

&#147;Hai Kaori-sama.&#148; 

&#147;You don&#146;t think this is too...revealing?&#148; Taiki asked Seiya. 
&#147;Please...didn&#146;t anyone ever tell you &#145;If you got it flaunt it?&#146;&#148; 
Seiya asked. Taiki blushed, &#147;Yeah, but...&#148; 

&#147;You act like you&#146;re the only one with large breast. Besides it&#146;s not 
like Ami-chan hasn&#146;t seen you naked before.&#148; 

&#147;How do YOU know!?&#148; 

&#147;I had a feeling that was going on between you two...&#148; Seiya answered 
with a sly grin. The girls, the Starlights &amp; Inner Senshi, were 
shopping and after about fourteen combinations Taiki found something 
interested her. She had found a tan long sleeved blouse that was v-cut 
and left nothing to the imagination and it wasn&#146;t until she put it to 
find out that is skin tight. This caused her bra to show completely, 
so she removed it. To match she had on a black skirt that was just 
above her knees. 

&#147;I thought she would NEVER find anything.&#148; Rei said sucking on her 
sucker. &#147;Ne Ami-chan, why didn&#146;t you go in there with Taiki and help 
her change?&#148; Yaten teased. Ami turned as red as ever and looked away. 
&#147;Ahh Ami-channnn I knew she would help you with SOMETHING sooner or 
later.&#148; Rei said. &#147;You&#146;re nasty Rei-chan.&#148; Usagi said. &#147;Uh guys...&#148; a 
voice said from behind. &#147;Oh Taiki-san that looks so good on you!&#148; 
Makoto exclaimed. &#147;Thanks...&#148; 

&#147;Ami-chan say something...&#148; Minako whispered. Ami looked at the floor, 
&#147;You look very beautiful.&#148; she said still blushing. &#147;Thank you 
Ami-chan.&#148; Ami looked up and their eyes met. &#147;Soooo Taiki are you 
getting&#146; it or what?&#148; Seiya asked. &#147;Sure, why not. I&#146;ll be back.&#148; with 
that she retreated to the dressing room. 

&#147;Whoa.&#148; Usagi said. &#147;What?&#148; Ami asked. &#147;The look you were giving each 
other, it had love and passion written all over it.&#148; 

&#147;You&#146;re nasty Usagi-chan.&#148; Rei and Yaten said in union mimicking what 
she had said earlier. 

Then they went to Victoria&#146;s Secret, a place Ami and Taiki weren&#146;t 
comfortable going to. Then to Bath &amp; Body Works, Usagi&#146;s and Minako&#146;s 
favorite place. &#147;God! Talk about high prices!&#148; Makoto said looking 
through the lotion. &#147;But it&#146;s worth it!&#148; Minako exclaimed. &#147;Do you 
think all this AND you guys are gonna fit in my car?&#148; Seiya asked. 
&#147;Seiya, NOTHING can fit in that piece of shit you call a car.&#148; Yaten 
said. &#147;Hey at least it runs!&#148; Later the girls headed to Usagi&#146;s house 
for some fun. &#147;What is this game called again?&#148; Usagi asked Seiya who 
was returning with a bottle of whisky, &#147;Hey where did you get that!?&#148; 

&#147;I found it, I&#146;m kidding I bought it especially for this kind of game. 
I haven&#146;t found a name for it though. It&#146;s where you say something you 
haven&#146;t done and those who have drink this. It&#146;s a good way to find 
out more about each other.&#148; Seiya explained. &#147;By getting us drunk off 
our asses?&#148; Rei asked. &#147;Well Rei since you had to open your mouth why 
don&#146;t you go first?&#148; 

&#147;Nah let Usagi-chan go first. It IS her house.&#148; 

&#147;Ok! When the Three Lights were here the first time I never had a 
sexual fantasy about them.&#148; Usagi admitted. &#147;Ok Seiya-chan hand it 
over.&#148; Rei said and drank deeply then Makoto, then Minako, and finally 
Ami. &#147;Ami-chan really!?&#148; Usagi asked. &#147;Yeah...&#148; Ami answered. &#147;Ok 
Ami-chan your next.&#148; Makoto said. &#147;Let&#146;s see... I have never failed at 
anything.&#148; That meant everybody except Taiki. &#147;That wasn&#146;t fair 
Ami-chan!&#148; Usagi whined, &#147;That was almost everybody!&#148; Then it was 
Minako&#146;s turn, &#147;Let me think of a good one... I am not afraid to show 
my true feelings.&#148; Minako got everybody on that one. Then it was 
Seiya&#146;s turn, &#147;Oh please Seiya don&#146;t say anything vulgar.&#148; Taiki said. 
&#147;Oh why not? Besides I don&#146;t say things like that.&#148; 

&#147;Oh yes you do!&#148; Yaten jumped in. &#147;Whatever. Anywayz, I never had sex 
in public places.&#148; Both Ami and Taiki blushed deeply, but drank from 
the bottle anyway. The rest of the girls stared at them shocked. 
Yaten, who already figured it, asked, &#147;So, when you guys said that you 
were locked in the library it was...oh dear god.&#148; and started laughing 
followed by everyone else even Usagi. &#147;It&#146;s not funny!&#148; Ami shouted. 
&#147;Yes it is!&#148; Seiya said, &#147;Who could believe that innocent Ami-chan and 
cold-hearted Taiki would do such a thing!&#148; 

Soon the bottle was completely empty and everyone was drunk as hell, 
&#147;Ahh all gone.&#148; Seiya said childishly. &#147;Dammit wha are we gonna play 
now?&#148; Minako asked. &#147;Wha about Truth or Dare?&#148; 

&#147;Good idea Shei-chan!&#148; Usagi announced. &#147;I&#146;ll go firsht,&#148; Seiya said, 
&#147;Um, Mako-chan! Truth or Dare?&#148; 

&#147;Can I pick both? ...No ok. Uhh truth.&#148; 

&#147;Ok... ish it true that when you wake up in the mornin&#146; that your 
panties be crusty?&#148; Seiya asked and giggled at the question. &#147;Uh I 
don&#146;t think sho, but I&#146;ll go with no. Mmm ok, Taiki-shan! Truth or 
Dare?&#148; 

&#147;Ah hell dare.&#148; 

&#147;Are you shure?&#148; 

&#147;Yesh.&#148; 

&#147;Ok at ten o&#146;clock I want you to run around the block, butt-ass 
naked.&#148; Everyone laughed, &#147;Ok, what time ish it now?&#148; Taiki asked 
calmly. &#147;It&#146;sh ten now.&#148; Ami answered. &#147;Better get a shtreakin&#146; 
Taiki!&#148; Yaten said. &#147;And we&#146;ll go with her to make shure she does it!&#148; 
Makoto announced and everyone went outside. 

Meanwhile Kado had created a dozen youma to make his search for 
Fighter eaiser, &#147;Remember, none of you are to return until you find 
either Fighter or something or someone that will bring her to us got 
that?&#148; he asked. All the youma nodded, &#147;Good now go!&#148; he ordered and 
they left. 

[CM] 

&#147;Ahh that was very entertaining,&#148; Usagi said as they went back inside, 
&#147;Thanksh Mako-chan.&#148; 

&#147;No prob.&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m gonna get you back for that one day Mako-chan.&#148; Taiki said once 
all her clothes were back on. &#147;Ha! No double dares!&#148; Makoto said. &#147;Ok 
let me messh with Aino-shan.&#148; 

&#147;Uh I&#146;ll dare too.&#148; 

&#147;Kay, I dare you to...uh, kissh Tshukino-shan!&#148; 

&#147;Uh Taiki I think you had too much to drink.&#148; Rei said. &#147;Let her have 
her fun Rei-chan. She&#146;s finally taking out the shtick that&#146;s been up 
her assh for sho long.&#148; Yaten said. &#147;I never had a shtick up my assh.&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;sh an espresso Taiki-shan.&#148; Usagi explained. &#147;But then an 
expression is that drink you get at Shtar Bucksh, ne?&#148; Seiya said. &#147;I 
thought it wuz the other way around.&#148; Minako said. &#147;Me too.&#148; Within 
minutes everyone was in a deep sleep snoring loudly. Then their senshi 
senses started to kick in waking them up about an hour later. 
&#147;Minna-san it&#146;s a youma!&#148; Usagi said. &#147;WE KNOW!&#148; 

&#147;MOON CRYSTAL, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;FIGHTER CRYSTAL STAR, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;MERCURY SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;MARS SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;JUPITER SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;VENUS SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;MAKER SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

&#147;HEALER SILVER POWER, MAKE-UP!&#148; 

The senshi soon found what was causing all the trouble and disturbing 
their slumber. &#147;Stop right there!&#148; Crystal Sailor Moon told the youma. 
&#147;How dare steal crystal from people with true and pure love.&#148; Silver 
Sailor Mercury said. &#147;And waking us up in the middle of the night.&#148; 
Silver Sailor Venus said. &#147;Especially with killer migraines.&#148; Crystal 
Sailor Star Fighter added. &#147;Hey that&#146;s not we&#146;re suppose to say!&#148; Moon 
said. &#147;Ah who cares let&#146;s just end this!&#148; Silver Sailor Mars said. &#147;IN 
THE NAME OF THE MOON...WE WILL PUNISH YOU!!!!!&#148; The youma paid them no 
attention except Fighter and attacked. &#147;VENUS DOUBLE CRESCENT SHOWER!&#148; 
Venus shouted. The attack destroyed the youma&#146;s arms as it came 
towards Fighter. It lay still for a second then got up again. 

&#147;MARS HOLY FIRE SURROUND!&#148; 

&#147;JUPITER LIGHTENING EXPLOSION!&#148; 

Fire and lightening engulfed the youma, its skin begging to peel. &#147;Now 
Sailor Moon!&#148; Jupiter ordered. &#147;GOLDEN STARMOON LOVE POWER!&#148; But 
before she could release the attack another youma grabbed her from 
behind and knocked her scepter out of her hands, sending far away from 
her. The other ten youma appeared out of nowhere. &#147;MERCURY ARTICT 
BLIZZARD!&#148; Her attack froze most of them, but they just broke free. 
&#147;Sailor Star Fighter, you are of great interest to us.&#148; one of them 
said. &#147;Uh why? And what for?&#148; Fighter asked. &#147;Does it matter 
Seiya-baka!? Just attack!&#148; Healer ordered, &#147;STAR HEALER TORNADO!&#148; 

&#148;STAR CRYSTAL DUST!&#148; 

&#147;STAR MAKER RELAXTION!&#148; 

All three attacks hit the youma at once, but they showed no affect. 
One of the youma picked up the Scepter and it let off a blinding pink 
light. The scenery around them faded and the senshi were now moving 
through another dimension. </pre>
