<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 4 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Everyone stood there, in shock, as to what had happened. Usagi and 
Makoto looked at the other three as Ami, Rei, and Minako looked back 
at them. Then, Usagi ran forward and threw her arms around Ami and 
Rei, and hugged them close.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you guys!&quot; She cried out. They returnedher hug, Minako 
standing next to them smiling.

Minako turned her head towards Makoto seemed to walking carefully as 
she approached.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Minako said quietly when Makoto was near her.

&quot;Hi,&quot; Makoto replied back just as soft. &quot;How are you?&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;I&#39;m headachey now. But fine otherwise.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Makoto said turning to face the other three girls, who had now 
turned to face them. &quot;Hey Rei-chan. Ami.&quot; 

Rei let go of Usagi and ran into Makoto&#39;s arms, hugging her tightly. 
Makoto smiled and hugged Rei back. Out of the corner of her eye, she 
saw Usagi embrace Minako...

------------------------------------------------------------

The five girls and their guardian cats gathered into Rei&#39;s bedroom, 
just like they use to. Usagi and Rei sat on her bed, Ami sat at Rei&#39;s 
desk and Makoto and Minako sat in the floor. And instead of them 
sitting at opposite sides of the room, they sat next to one another, 
their arms touching, Minako with her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder. Rei 
smiled over at them.

&quot;Its appearnt,&quot; Luna said over the chit chat, &quot;that we have a new 
enemy.&quot;

All eyes focused on the black cat who spoke to them, their attitudes 
becoming serious.

&quot;Do we know anything about it,&quot; Minako asked, not taking her head off 
of Makoto&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Iie,&quot; Artemis said, who then looked over at Ace. &quot;However, enimies 
are not the only things new..&quot;

&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Ami pipped in.

&quot;Luna, Artemis, and I are not the only guardians...&quot;

&quot;Nani,&quot; Creid out Rei, Minako, and Ami together.

&quot;Rei and Ami will have their guardians soon,&quot; Ace said. &quot;Although I&#39;m 
not sure when they will appear to you.&quot;

The girls nodded their understanding, then several of them yawned. The 
guardians smiled.

&quot;Everyone go home,&quot; Ace said. &quot;We&#39;l have another meeting when we have 
more info for you.&quot; 

The girls nodded, and all but Rei stood up to leave. 

Usagi and Ami had walked ahead of Makoto and Minako, who walked slowly 
outside.

They walked down the stairs in time to see Ami and Usagi turn the 
corner of the street. Makoto thought they were going to Ami&#39;s house so 
Usagi could get her notes for class.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto stopped short and turned to look at Minako when they reached 
Makoto&#39;s car. 

&quot;Hai?&quot;

Minako faltered. She couldn&#39;t get the words out of her mouth. Why 
couldnt she just say &#39;Makoto, I love you?&#39;

&quot;I..uh....er....&quot;

Makoto smiled and walked over to Minako, bent down and kissed her 
cheek. 

Minako blushed and looked into Makoto&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;I know Mina. I love you too.&quot;

Minako smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako yawned, the sun light pouring in from the blinds. She blinked 
several times, trying to have her eyes adjust to the clock. The time 
read 10:17 am.

Minako yanwed again and streched, feeling something paw at her back. 
She turned to see Artemis sitting there.

&quot;Morning, sleepy head,&quot; he said with a smirk. &quot;Did you have fun last 
night? I know Mako stayed here with you.&quot;

Minako blushed.

&quot;Hai, I did stay,&quot; said a voice from the door. &quot;But I slpet on the 
couch thank you very much, nosey.&quot; 

Artemis gave Makoto a look.

&quot;Go look at the couch if you don&#39;t believe me, whitey.&quot; Makoto said, 
fastening the last two buttons on the bottom of her shirt.

&quot;I dont care,&quot; Artemis said, jumping from the bed and walking out of 
the room. Makoto smiled, shut the door and sat next to Minako on the 
bed. Minako had a coyle smile playing on her face.

&quot;You didnt sleep on the couch last night.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;I know that. You know that. Arty, however, doesn&#39;t 
know that. He wasn&#39;t home last night.&quot;

Minako sat up and wrapped her arms around Makoto&#39;s neck and kissed her 
gently. Makoto eagerly returned it. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;So where was Ace after you came home with me, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako 
called from the bath room. 

&quot;I&#39;m assuming he went home last night,&quot; Makoto answered.

&quot;I see.&quot; Minako came from the bath room wearing a pair of baggy jeans, 
an oragnge belt, and an orange teeshirt tucked inside her jeans, the 
sleeves rolled up slightly. On her feet were a pair of &#39;workman&#39;s 
boots and her hair was done in its usual style. 

&quot;Hey, Minako? Do you mind if I catch up to you later? I got some 
running to do.&quot;

Minkao smiled. &quot;Oh sure, no prob. I gotta meet up with Rei today 
anyway.&quot;

Makoto quirked an eyebrow. &quot;Why?&quot;

Minako smiled and kissed Makoto&#39;s nose. &quot;Hmm, wouldn&#39;t you like to 
know?&quot;

&quot;Yes I would,&quot; Makoto said, standing from Minako&#39;s bed, her face only 
inches from the blonde&#39;s face.

Minako smiled and blushed slightly. Her face was pointed down, but her 
blue eyes would peek up to see Makoto&#39;s feirce green eyes staring back 
down on her. Minako would giggle and turn away again.

Makoto smiled and laid her hands gently on Minako&#39;s shoulders. 

Minako closed her eyes and allowed the warmth from Makoto&#39;s body 
engulf her as she snuggled into the amazon&#39;s embrace.

&quot;Ne, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto rested her head on Minako&#39;s head, closed her own eyes and 
smiled. &quot;Hai, Mina?&quot;...

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako lightly knocked on Rei&#39;s bedroom. Rei smiled as she slid her 
door open and ushered her friend inside.

&quot;Konnichi wa, Mina,&quot; Rei said, closing her bedroom after her friend. 
&quot;How are you?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m great,&quot; Minako said smiling.

Rei leaned against her bedroom wall and smirked. &quot;You got laid last 
night, didnt you?&quot;

Minako blushed deep crimson. &quot;Uh..I..uh...I-THATS NONE OF YOUR 
BUSINESS REI!&quot;

Rei held her stoamche and laughed. &quot;I knew you would sleep with her 
last night.&quot;

&quot;REI!&quot;

Rei continued to laugh as she sat next to Minako, who had sat on the 
bed. &quot;I have to tease you, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako smiled and nodded. &quot;Hai, I know.&quot;

&quot;So, how is the sex anyway?&quot;

&quot;REI!&quot;

Rei laughed more. &quot;Ok ok ok..I quit. Why are you in a good mood 
anyway?&quot;

&quot;I have a dance coming up at school, and-&quot;

&quot;You asked Makoto to take you didnt you!?&quot;

&quot;-and I wasn&#39;t gonna go till I got my memory back and met up with 
Mako-chan again,&quot; Minako said without listening to Rei. &quot;I asked her 
and she said yes.&quot;

Rei smiled. &quot;I knew she would. You guys are so cute!&quot; 

Minako blushed and smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto quickly hopped out of the shower and dried off. She ran into 
her bed room, naked as the day she was born. She threw her towel over 
at her bed, it landing on the blue cat sleeping there.

Ace raised his head and looked around. He shook his head realizing he 
couldnt see anything and the towel slipped off his head in time for 
him to see Makoto slide on a pair of navy blue silk boxers.

&quot;Hot date?&quot;

Makoto groaned and looked over at the smirking feline. &quot;I have that 
date with Minako tonight.&quot; She found her bra and quickly slipped it on 
and fastened it.

Ace nodded in remberance. &quot;Oh yea, I remember. Are you coming home 
tonight?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;unno yet,&quot; Makoto said, sliding on a tight sports bra. &quot;Gonna leave 
if I do?&quot;

Ace laughed at the evil expression on Makoto&#39;s face. &quot;I don&#39;t know...I 
may show up with a video camera!&quot;

&quot;ACE!&quot;

Ace laughed again.

Makoto sighed and grabbed her black slacks off the desk chair and 
quickly put them on. She then walked to her closet and took out her 
white silk button up shirt and slid her arms thru it and settled it on 
her back and shoulders.

&quot;I tell ya what, Mako-chan,&quot; Ace said jumping from the bed. &quot;I&#39;ll 
leave for the night so you and Minako can come here for the night and 
have some time alone.&quot;

Makoto blushed slighty as Ace smirked and left the room. Makoto sighed 
and finished buttoning her shirt.

The music that greeted Makoto was beyond loud. All around her were 
hormonial teeneagers hoping to get some action that night from their 
dates.

She hated Valentines Day.

She did, however, until she took another glace to her left to see the 
goddess that clung to her arm. Minako was just beautiful in the outfit 
she wore. She didnt wear a dress Makoto thought she would. Instead she 
wore a pair of low cut, faded blue jeans that flared slightly at the 
bottom that on the outside of her left pant leg was a chain of hearts. 
Her shirt was a tank top that reveled a smooth stomache with a very 
slight pudge. On her shirt, in glitter words, was the word &#39;Angel&#39;. 
She may have been dressed casual, but Makoto thought she looked great 
that way.

Minako smiled up at Makoto and took hold of her hand. &quot;Come on, 
Mako-chan. I want to introduce you around..&quot;

Makoto groaned as her hand was nearly ripped from her arm as Minako 
drug her across the gym floor to a group of giggling girls Makoto knew 
instantly were Minako&#39;s friends from school.

&quot;Mina-chan,&quot; One girl cried out from the group. &quot;I&#39;m glad to see you! 
I didn&#39;t think you were going to make it!&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;Why would I miss the Valentine&#39;s day dance? I have 
been looking forward to it for months!&quot;

The girl smiled. &quot;So who&#39;s your friend?&quot;

Minako smiled and hugged Makoto&#39;s arm. &quot;This is Kino Makoto, my 
girlfriend.&quot;

The other four girls blinked and stared. &quot;Your...girlfriend?&quot;

&quot;Uh-oh&quot;, Makoto thought. &quot;Not good. She&#39;s gonna lose her friends coz 
of me. Nice!&quot; Makoto groaned inwardly.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Minako answered cheerfully.

&quot;You&#39;re a lesbian,&quot; they asked, still unbeliving.

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

The &#39;leader&#39; of the small group blinked, then laughed. &quot;If I had known 
that, I would have asked you out a long time ago!&quot;

Minako smiled and clung to Makoto&#39;s arm. Makoto smiled at them, but 
sighed. She was happy her friends at her school still accepted her.

The small group of girls talked, mostly about Minako and Makoto, and 
Makoto smiled. She loved Minako dearly, but sometmes she was a little 
too much too handle.

&quot;Mina-chan,&quot; Makoto said. 

The blonde looked up at the tall brunette and smiled. &quot;Hai, 
Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Dance,&quot; Minako asked, nodding towards the dance floor. Minako smiled 
and nodded leading Makoto to the dance floor.

The beat was fast, but that didn&#39;t matter. Makoto took Minako&#39;s hand 
and spun her out then gently jerked her back to her. Just as Minako 
was in Makoto&#39;s embrace, a cry rang out and they both looked into the 
general direction of it. 

~There&#39;s a ship out on the ocean at the mercy of the sea
It&#39;s been tossed about lost and broken wandering aimlessly
And God, somehow you know that ship is me

Because there&#39;s a lighthouse in a harbor shining faithfully
Pouring its light across the water for this sinking soul to see
That someone out there still believes in me~

Dust from a broken in wall was everywhere. Makoto pulled Minako downed 
and coughed.

&quot;Its a youma. We need to transform now!&quot;

Minako coughed as well as the dust filtered in thru her mouth. &quot;Hai, 
but where? Too many people.&quot;

Makoto scanned the crowd of yelling and screaming teenagers, trying to 
find a way out. Not being able to see one clearly, Makoto grabbed 
Minako&#39;s wrist and lead her to what looked like a door to a bath room. 
Sure enough thats what it was.

&quot;Inside,&quot; Makoto ordered, making sure no one followed them in. Once 
they were both inside, Makoto checked under the stalls, and finding no 
one there, cried out, &quot;JUPITER POWER, MAKE-UP!&quot;

Minako watched as lightening surrounded her girlfriend before 
transforming as well. 

&quot;VENUS POWER, MAKE-UP!&quot; Lights and hearts flowed around Minako&#39;s body, 
turning her into the orginal Senshi of justice, Sailor Venus.

Venus looked over at Makoto, now transformed into Sailor Jupiter and 
nodded. &quot;Ready?&quot; Jupiter nodded and they both broke out into the gym, 
which now laid in ruin. Rubble from the gym lay every where and there 
didnt seem to be any casulties any where. There weren&#39;t any students 
left, either. They had all left.

&quot;HEY!&quot; Jupiter and Venus turned their heads toward the voice. There 
was a figure running towards them, but because the dust had yet to 
settle they couldn&#39;t make the person out until they were closer.

&quot;How did you two get here so fast?&quot;

&quot;We were here when the attack hit, Mercury,&quot; Jupiter said. &quot;We ducked 
into the bath room and transformed. When we came out the place lay in 
shambles and we were only in there a few seconds.&quot;

Mercury nodded, tapped her earring and activated her visor. &quot;Any sign 
of the youma?&quot;

&quot;Iie,&quot; Venus said, looking around. &quot;We haven&#39;t seen it. Maybe it 
left?&quot;

Jupiter shook her head. &quot;Iie...its still here.&quot;

Mercury looked at Jupiter confused. &quot;How can you tell? I&#39;m not picking 
anything up on my computer...&quot;

&quot;Its still here, trust me. Call it a sixth sense.&quot; Jupiter walked away 
from the other two senshi, trying to home in on the youma. Sometimes 
being part youma herself was a good thing.

Jupiter snapped her head to the left, and yelled out where the youma 
was just seconds before it appeared and threw a large fire ball 
towards them. Mercury and Venus barely jumped out of the way in time 
to stay alive.

Venus landed next to Jupiter, and only had a slight cut on her arm 
where a piece of rock hit her arm. Mercury, on the other hand, went 
sliding in water from a busted pipe and hit her head, knocking her out 
cold.

As the smoke from the blast began to clear, Jupiter and Venus senshi 
looked towards their attacker. It wasn&#39;t a youma.

It was a human.

~On a prayer in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Raining down against the wind
I&#39;m reaching out until we reach the circle&#39;s end
When you come back to me again~

Mercury didn&#39;t know what happened. She had been trying to find the 
youma that had attacked Minako&#39;s school when everything went black.

She sat up, opened her eyes and blinked. Everything was so bright. &quot;Oh 
Kami-sama, have I died?&quot;

She let her eyes adjust before taking in everything around her. 
Although it was day, the sky was black, with thousands of stars 
twinkling in the sky. Mercury looked towards her left, and looked up 
at the sky. She saw a half Earth hanging above her. Thats when she 
realised where she was.

&quot;I&#39;m on the moon,&quot; sah said calmly, although confused. She stood and 
looked around. It was obvious she was in the gardens of the Moon 
Palace, but she was still confused as to why she was there. She heard 
laughing and giggling and with out thinking, she ducked behind a long 
bush of flowers, peeking her head up to see who it was.

Seconds passed like minutes; minutes passed like hours as she waited. 
She didn&#39;t want to be caught. She waited longer before hearing the 
laugh again. She recognised it as her own. Then she heard a squeal and 
knew once again it was her past self making the noise. Then she saw 
her self run by the bush, laughing, then stopping.

Mercury blinked wondering just what was happening. Her past self was 
dressed in a royal blue gown, one made for spring. Still regal, but 
light enough to be cool. Princess Mercury was laughing still, her face 
red from running. Mercury knew that look on her face. She had it on 
her own face when ever she was around Urawa. 

&quot;My old self is running from someone she loves,&quot; Mercury thought to 
herself. Then she smiled, for the first time since being there. She 
was about to see her old love from a thousand years ago. A thought 
fluttered in her mind for a moment; maybe, after seeing them, she 
could find them and they could be happy again like they are now.

&quot;Come on!&quot; Mercury looked up to see her past self yelling and giggling 
at the same time. &quot;You can run faster than that!&quot;

She heard a rustle of some bushes then a figure jump out and grap 
Princess Mercury in a firce hug. &quot;Hai I can! But I like the thrill of 
the hunt, Love. You know that.&quot;

Mercury&#39;s eyes widend. She knew that voice! She closed her eyes 
tightly and prayed she was wrong. A giggleing sound then a moan made 
her snap her head up to see what was happening. And thats when she saw 
who it was before blacking out again.

------------------------------------------------------------

~There&#39;s a moment that we all come to
In our own time and in our own space
Where all that we have done we can undo
If our heart&#39;s in the right place~

Mercury felt herslef being juggled up and down, the movement making 
her sick to her stomache. She felt warm, tho. Someone was hugging her 
close and protectivly, and she didn&#39;t want to leave that place.

She heard a loud explosian and it jolted her fully awake. She peeked 
her eyes open and saw what was left of Mianko&#39;s highschool gym go up 
in flames. 

&quot;Nice Mars,&quot; Mercury heard. &quot;Next time why dont you just kill us all! 
Save the enemy some time!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, Venus!&quot;

All the voices where slurred inside Mercury&#39;s head. And they were at 
least ten times louder than how they actually were.

&quot;Come on guys. She&#39;s waking up. Shut up and let her get her head 
together.&quot; That voice was closer than the other&#39;s. The bobbing up and 
down began to slow and then stoped completly. Mercury pulled her head 
away from ehr saviour&#39;s shoulder and looked up. And mercury blushed 
from head to toe when blue met green.

------------------------------------------------------------

~On a prayer in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Raining down against the wind
I&#39;m reaching out until we reach the circle&#39;s end
When you come back to me again~

Ami groaned the following day as she woke up. her head was killing 
her. How could she have been so stupid as to let such a careless 
mistake happen? She could have died. Had it not been for Sailor 
Jupiter...

Ami bolted up from her bed, eyes wide with fear. She had to find Luna 
and talk to her. NOW! She had to know who was her lover in the Silver 
Millenium. 

As Ami dressed, she prayed that the person she saw in the vision was a 
mistake.

And a small part of her hoped it was.

~Again and again I see
My yesterday&#39;s in front of me
Unfolding like a mystery
You&#39;re changing all that is and used to be

On a prayer in a song
I hear your voice and it keeps me hanging on
Raining down against the wind
I&#39;m reaching out until we reach the circle&#39;s end
When you come back to me again~ </pre>
