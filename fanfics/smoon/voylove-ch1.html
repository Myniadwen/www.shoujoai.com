<p><u>What's a Mutiny? Sounds Fun- Let's Try It!</u></p>
<p>“Like  a big fat pig, the tide tosses itself against the beach, grinding  together the tough grains of sands along with dozens of unburnable  trash, moaning its agony as it is pierced by a sharp piece of broken  glass-”</p>
<p>“Minako?   Stop it. Not only is that disturbing; it's starting to make me  seasick.”</p>
<p>A  woman with flowing blond hair in a white captain's suit turned to her  companion, an innocent grin on her rosy lips. “Aww, what's  wrong, Rei-chan? Don't you like my poetry?”</p>
<p>Her  companion, a raven-haired beauty, flicked a lone lock of hair over  her shoulder before giving her captain a stern look. “If  that's your idea of poetry, I <em>never</em> want to hear your attempts at writing songs.”</p>
<p>Taking  the notion completely off track, Minako's eyes lit up with glee.   “You want to hear me sing? Why, I'd be honored. Just name the  time and place. Or I could do it now-”</p>
<p>“No!”   Rei let out a slow, calming breath before turning her violet eyes  back to the one person who didn't visibly shudder at the smoldering  anger within. “Just... don't you have <em>captain</em> duties to  attend to?”</p>
<p>Still  smiling as bright as the sun above, Minako innocently remarked, “I'm  a merchant's daughter- but my uncle is letting me try my hand at  being captain this week. But... is it just me, or does everyone  already know what to do?”</p>
<p>Rei  scratched the back of her head as she sighed, already knowing what  Minako's uncle had in mind. '<em>Keep her occupied in a place  where she's not likely to be a troublemaker,' </em>he  had told Rei. There'd be little to do let alone make a mess of if  she was in the middle of the sea. '<em>Keep her away for a  week so as to not ruin the surprise party upon her return.' </em>Despite  knowing this, Rei was still wondering why <em>she</em> of all people, had been given the week off to keep an eye on Minako. <em>They probably want me out of the city too. Ah, two  troublemakers out where the sea shines on every horizon... I'm  already feeling sick.</em></p>
<p>“Rei-chan?”   The generally seclusive priestess snapped out of her reverie, only  to be brought inches to her captain, her best friend's, face. “Are  you all right?”</p>
<p>Startled,  Rei stepped back with a shocked look, as most could not creep up on  her so well without being noticed. “Don't... don't step so  close.”</p>
<p>Minako  broke into another grin, concern disposed of upon hearing her friend  reply. “Aw, don't be like that! Hey,” paying no heed to  Rei's comment, she stepped closer and whispered, “Do you think  we're being set up?”</p>
<p>Her  proximity shut down a fair percentage of Rei's cohesive deduction  cells, and therefore allowed her to mistake the nature of the  question. “I don't think of us like that...”</p>
<p>Curious,  Minako tilted her head slightly, humming a small note as a way of  prompting her to continue. Rei turned her head away, already feeling  a light blush come into her cheeks, as she said, “We're best  friends so...”</p>
<p>“Mmm...  my uncle wanted me to have a companion I trusted as my co-captain,  right?”</p>
<p>“...Eh?”</p>
<p>It  took a few moments before Rei's mind could successfully push the  rewind and play button and remember what Minako had been talking  about before she spaced out. Then taking into account how different  Minako's topic was to hers... she breathed a sigh of relief that  Minako hadn't realized it, too.</p>
<p>Rei  softly shook her head. “Captain Aino has been a trusted leader  since before you were even a thought. His crew has been well trained  by him, to the point where no one really needs to give them orders,  as they've been doing their job for a long time now. Of course there  isn't much for a captain to do. Well... actually-”</p>
<p>“What,  what is it? I'm really getting bored here, Rei-chan! Come on, tell  me!”</p>
<p>Rei  peeked through one leaden eyelid at her friend, and grinned. “You  could take a dive and get left behind to starve or drown...”</p>
<p>Minako  frowned, knowing full well that for one, a captain sunk with her  ship. For two... “What does that have to do with being a  captain?”</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged nonchalantly. “You said you were bored.”</p>
<p>“I  can swim when we reach the port. Come on- I know you were thinking  of something else.”</p>
<p>“Feel  like writing?”</p>
<p>Minako  instantly backed off. “Not in particular... why?”</p>
<p>“I  believe it's the captain's duty to make a daily journal entry of what  happens on any voyage.”</p>
<p>“But...  but nothing's happening!”</p>
<p>“We're  moving aren't we?”</p>
<p>“...You're  awfully sarcastic today.”</p>
<p>“...So?”</p>
<p>“Rei!   Tell me what <em>you</em> do then. Maybe I can help!”</p>
<p>“My  job is to watch <em>you</em>.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Any  ideas, Captain?”</p>
<p>Minako  perked up as if a light bulb had turned on in her mind. “I  know! Let's talk!”</p>
<p>“...  All right. Then what were we just doing?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>Rei  sighed, and walked over to the railing so she could lean against it.   “You could always go below deck and help stoke the fire.”</p>
<p>Minako  wrinkled her nose at the thought. “You're more comfortable  with fire then I am.” Suddenly, another bulb went off and she  hurried to stand alongside Rei. “I know! Let's practice our  powers! We shouldn't get rus-”</p>
<p>“No.”   Knowing she was waiting for a fuller reply, Rei sighed and added,  “My fire is too destructive to effectively practice on a ship,  and there's no telling <em>what</em> your meteor shower will do. I am <em>not</em> paying for the damages.”</p>
<p>“You're  just here to make sure I don't give you a reason to need to, right?”</p>
<p>“In  a manner of speaking.”</p>
<p>“Hmm...  Well, what do sailors usually do while out at sea, anyway?”</p>
<p>“Depends  on who you are and what kind of ship you have. Order people around,  drink cocktails, swim in a pool, row the boat, stoke the fire, record  coordinates from the nest, take care of the sails, mutiny against the  pompous captain, drop or raise anchor...”</p>
<p>“Hold  on. What was the second to last thing you said? Mu...tiny?”   Rei merely nodded. “Ehh... say, what's that word defined as?”</p>
<p>“What  do I look like- a walking dictionary?”</p>
<p>“No,  your soul would probably burn your pages right up. You should know  relatively speaking though, right?”</p>
<p>“Mutiny  is when you... when subordinates group together to rebel against  their leader... it's usually considered a thing that happens with  sailors.”</p>
<p>“Ooh...  Like us? Sailor senshi?”</p>
<p>A  cold draft suddenly chilled Rei's bones. <em>Why do I get a bad  feeling about this...?</em> “Actual sailors, Mina. Like your  uncle and his crew.”</p>
<p>“Eh...  so what does a mew-tiny usually consist of?”</p>
<p>“Consist...?   I'm no expert on it but... it usually means imprisoning or killing  the current leader, selecting a new one, and then basically going on  strike, not doing what any higher powers might want them to do.”</p>
<p>“You  mean like... turning into pirates?”</p>
<p>“Uh...  I suppose that's happened before... sure... Mina? Do I want to know  why you're so interested in it?”</p>
<p>“Hey  Rei, let's try it!”</p>
<p>“Try...  try what?”</p>
<p>“Let's  go on a mutant-thingy!”</p>
<p>“Mutiny  Mina. You want me to kill you?”</p>
<p>“What?   No! Uncle is 'away' at the kingdom, so technically, I'm the new  captain, at least for a week, right? So... after we drop off our  commodity of tea, let's burn and plunder like pirates! You're  already a pyromaniac, and I already have command of a ship, so it'll  be easy. Sounds fun, doesn't it?”</p>
<p>Rei  stared at Minako like she'd suddenly grown another head. “You'd  never get the crew to agree.”</p>
<p>“Aw,  all they have to do is not run out on me and take care of the ship.   We can do the active pirating!”</p>
<p>“Who  ever heard of a pair of pirates with a non-active crew?”</p>
<p>“So  that means you'll pair up with me?”</p>
<p>“...No.”</p>
<p>“Hey,  you hesitated! Come on, it'll be really fun. Besides, I want to do  a last sprint of mayhem before I become an official “Lady”  of the Kingdom. Please, Rei-chan?”</p>
<p><em>Keep  her occupied... Keep her out of trouble... Which one's more  important!</em> Eventually, Rei sighed and muttered, “This is  crazy... <em>You're</em> crazy... what are you going to do with the  loot?”</p>
<p>“Hmm...  you know, I think Ami-chan once said that the Treasury was running  low on valuable items...”</p>
<p>Rei  continued her stare of disbelief. “You're going to donate <em>stolen goods</em> to a <em>Royal Treasury</em>! Now I <em>know</em> you're insane.”</p>
<p>“But  Rei-!”</p>
<p>“That  isn't even real piracy, Mina! And a merchant's daughter doesn't even  need to <em>learn</em> how real piracy works. <em>Or</em> mutinies.”</p>
<p>“...What  if I said that's what I wanted for my 21st birthday?”</p>
<p>“...I'd  call you an idiot on top of being insane.”</p>
<p>Minako  lowered her head sullenly, before looking up at Rei with a large pout  and tears in her eyes. “<em>Please</em>, Rei? You know I'd do  the same for you!”</p>
<p>“I  wouldn't ask for something like this.”</p>
<p>“...Still!   Fine- what do you want for <em>your</em> 21st? It'll be an  exchange- hands on piracy lessons for whatever you want, within my  power.”</p>
<p>Rei  considered it a moment before turning her eyes on Mina's, a  malevolent glint midst the depths of purple. “All right. What  if I want you to <em>stop</em> this idiocy and <em>not</em> have me teach  you how to be a pirate?”</p>
<p>A  sideways frown broke Mina's attempt at a pout. “Rei...!   That'd be counterproductive!”</p>
<p>“So  would your idea.”</p>
<p>Mina  fidgeted from one foot to the other and back before finally asking,  “Rei-chan, in all seriousness, what <em>would</em> you like for  your 21st birthday?”</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged and looked back at the sea. “Haven't thought about it  much.”</p>
<p>Leaning  on the railing again as well, Mina whispered, most of her insane  energy seeming to have seeped out, “Really? You seem like the  type that would want one, and only one thing for a really long time,  but keep it so well hidden that people are more likely to get things  that you'd throw out the next day than anywhere near what you want.   So won't you tell me, so that I can get it for you?”</p>
<p>Rei  grew quiet, a distant look in her eyes as she stared at the ever  moving waves. Just when Mina was starting to fall asleep in the  peaceful atmosphere, Rei murmured, “What I want... you could  never just 'get' it. Not... not the kind that I really want.”</p>
<p>A  serene smile passed over Minako's lips as her senses tingled. She  knew this feeling all too well. “If I can guess it then, and  find a way to... bring it to you, will you join me in my plan?”</p>
<p>Rei  turned to Minako then, her eyes widen in surprise. Quickly she  turned back, heat rising to her cheeks. “I'm not promising  anything.”</p>
<p>Minako  grinned then, having confirmed her suspicions even more. Brushing  their bare arms as she leaned closer, she asked, “It wouldn't  happen to be true love, would it?”</p>
<p>At  that, Rei's blush increased, and Mina took her reaction to be an  affirmative. “If it is... to have it cultivated before your  birthday a fortnight away... it'd have to already started, wouldn't  it?”</p>
<p>Although  she had already remembered just what Mina was the senshi of, Rei  refused to give in just yet. Under her breath she grumbled, “You  make it sound like it's some sort of plant.”</p>
<p>“Isn't  it though? Didn't Prince Endymion say, 'Love is like a rose,  beautiful when it's in bloom-” Minako stopped, suddenly  remembering the end of that saying and what the circumstances had  been when he'd said it. “Bah, still, Love is a beautiful thing  that with enough TLC, can blossom and brighten someone's day or  days.”</p>
<p>Rei  snorted softly. “But that kind of love can still <em>die</em> can't it? I want... I want to feel a love that I know will never  die.”</p>
<p>Her  whole body tensed when it felt two soft, slender arms wrap around her  waist, and a chin on her shoulder. “You mean like the love of  a certain eternal Goddess?”</p>
