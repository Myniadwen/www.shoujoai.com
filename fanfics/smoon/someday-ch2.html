<h1>Someday, Hold Me Close to You (part 2 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/someday-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>A part of her grew excited, while another part felt anxious. Getting 
letters from the full-fledged doctor was always a treat, but another one 
so soon? It worried her. Was she alright? Was it something to do with 
Makoto? Usagi?

&quot;Or...does it have to do with her?&quot;

Rei felt her stomach turn over the moment that possibility popped into 
her mind. She knew the letter was probably concerning something else. 
After all, the idol hadn&#39;t bothered to visit any of them since Makoto&#39;s 
wedding. There was only a short letter every now and then.

&quot;Which,&quot; Rei spoke aloud, &quot;she probably sends to all of us.&quot;

&quot;Like I&#39;m anything special...&quot;

&quot;Stop it!&quot; she shouted at herself. &quot;I don&#39;t care if I am or am not. I&#39;m 
not special to anyone, and I don&#39;t really care about that anymore.&quot;

Her mind flashed to a happy moment with her mother before she&#39;d passed 
away, and then the special &#39;meeting&#39; between she and Venus. It was the 
day Venus had humiliated her and practically forced her into that 
&#39;Naoko&#39; outfit. Even worse, she&#39;d made her utter the word Rei swore 
she&#39;d never say again...

Kupi.

Rei shook her head furiously, her hair flying all about.

&quot;Right, I should just get on with the letter and be thankful Usagi 
didn&#39;t write it. Kami-sama knows she cannot write.&quot;

She grabbed the letter before plopping herself down onto the floor, 
sitting Indian style. She tore the envelope open slowly, fatigue 
catching the best of her. She pulled the letter from it finally, and 
pushed her light brown, longish bangs away from her eyes.

Rei-chan,

I know this letter has arrived earlier than expected, but it&#39;s because I 
have wonderful news. Hopefully you will be pleased with it as well. Our 
very own Aino Minako has returned to Japan for a whole month! She still 
has a bit of work to do of course, but she&#39;s promised to make as much 
time for us as she possibly can, and I believe she&#39;s true to her word.

Rei&#39;s normal scowl deepened, and her eyes narrowed as much as they 
could. She hesitated in reading the rest of the letter. She didn&#39;t care 
if Minako was back in Japan. The thought of the idol being in the same 
country actually sickened and infuriated her. Ami knew of the tension 
between the two, so why was she rubbing it in Rei&#39;s face that they were 
all together, without her!

&quot;Iie. Ami-chan isn&#39;t &#39;rubbing it in my face&#39;. She&#39;s simply...letting me 
know what&#39;s going on over there in Tokyo. She likes when everyone is 
together. I know that.&quot;

Her shoulders slumped in mental defeat. She hated the fact she still 
acted like such an adolescent when it came to such small things... But 
that was just it. To her, this was a very BIG thing.

Rei-chan, I bet your fuming right now... But Minako-chan returning is 
very good, you see. All of us together again... Just like when we were 
senshi. But this time, we&#39;ll have Aino-san! I really think you should 
return to Tokyo, though... If not for Minako, then for Mako-chan, 
Usagi-chan, and myself. I hope and believe some part of you misses us. 
We miss you very much... And I&#39;m sure Minako-chan does as well.

Love,

Ami

Rei grunted. Her fingers clenched the bottom of her jeans.

&quot;Baka.&quot; She pulled her cell phone from her jacket pocket and flipped it 
open. She pushed the speed dial for number &#39;2&#39;, the shrine.

&quot;Mayumi-san? Yes, it&#39;s Hino Rei. Do me a favor and prepare my room. I&#39;ll 
be returning in about half a day.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Minako&#39;s private cell phone that was meant for her private line went 
off, waking her from her light slumber. It&#39;d been difficult for her to 
get to sleep that night, or rather that morning. It was mainly due to 
Usagi&#39;s words from the night before...and Artemis&#39; snoring.

She covered her head with her giant comforter, hoping to get some peace. 
But the ringing just wouldn&#39;t stop. She figured the person, whoever that 
may be, would&#39;ve gotten the picture that she wasn&#39;t planning on coming 
to the phone.

Finally, after about fifty rings, Minako sat up and retrieved her phone 
from the nightstand next to the bed.

&quot;Minako-chan!&quot;

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Minako spoke into the phone as she stifled a yawn.

&quot;Gomen!&quot; Usagi shouted even louder, causing Minako to hold the phone 
about a foot away from her ear. I still wonder how she was the Princess 
of the Moon...

&quot;Did I wake you!&quot; Minako shook her head up and down, but replied with,

&quot;No, I was just getting up. What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan&#39;s flying into Tokyo International Airport around 6 tonight!&quot;

Minako stopped breathing for a moment.

&quot;Do you wanna come with me and Mako-chan to pick her up?&quot; A baby&#39;s coo 
was heard in the background. Usagi laughed.

&quot;Oh, and chibi-Usa wants to come too!&quot;

&quot;Mars is actually coming back so soon? Could it be...?&quot; Minako whispered 
to herself, Artemis&#39; head perking up.

&quot;Nani Minako-chan?&quot; Usagi asked, her confusion obvious.

&quot;I-I&#39;m a bit busy... I have a photo shoot around 3. But-&quot;

&quot;Oh, darn!&quot;

&quot;-I think I can make it.&quot;

Usagi grinned and danced around with chibi-Usa, who giggled and drooled 
in response.

&quot;Yay! Then I&#39;ll call you back before we leave, okay?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Minako couldn&#39;t help but smile at her energetic friend and 
one-time Princess, even if she couldn&#39;t see her. She admired Usagi for 
having such a care-free spirit and always a happy outlook on everything.

&quot;Bai-bai!&quot;

&quot;Ja.&quot;

The line went dead and Minako closed her cell phone. She let herself 
fall back onto the bed, and nearly on Artemis.

&quot;I&#39;m guessing that was Usagi?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Hai.&quot; Artemis waited for Minako to give some more details, but she 
remained silent.

&quot;And?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going with her this evening to pick up Mars from the airport.&quot; 
Artemis climbed onto Minako&#39;s stomach.

&quot;You mean Rei?&quot;

Hearing Artemis say her name so casually put an uneasiness in the pit of 
her stomach. Was agreeing to go to the airport really a good decision?

&quot;Hai...Rei-san.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Are you sure this is a good idea, Usagi?&quot; Makoto looked over her 
shoulder and away from her frying pan to the bubbling Usagi and 
chibi-Usa.

&quot;Of course! It would make Rei really happy, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot;

Usagi&#39;s grin started to diminish, and now she was wearing a sad 
half-frown.

&quot;Well... I hope so.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s shoulders stiffened. Usagi frowning was one thing. 
Second-guessing herself nowadays? That was another.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rei tapped her foot on the ground. Her arms were crossed. Her 
expression&#151;pure anger. In short, she was pissed.

&quot;Just like Usagi to be almost an hour late. Baka odango-head.&quot;

&quot;Reiiii-chaaaaan!&quot; Came Usagi&#39;s high-pitched voice. Rei winced. She 
lazily looked around a few people, not caring too much if the girl saw 
her or not. She looked away when Usagi waved at her.

&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; Usagi bent over and held her knees in exhaustion. Rei looked 
at her with a raised eyebrow, waiting for her explanation.

&quot;Gomen ne! I&quot;-pant-&quot;am very late&quot;-pant-&quot;I know. But I had to pick up 
Mako-chan and&quot;-pant-&quot;Mi-&quot;

&quot;Usagi!&quot; Makoto yelled out, running over to her two friends. She too was 
out of breath; probably from chasing Usagi.

&quot;Well, at least I know they made an effort. A very horrible one,&quot; Rei 
thought to herself. She was going to let a rare genuine smile show, when 
someone else stopped next to Usagi. A very...unexpected someone.</pre>
