<h1>Slowly Dawning (part 6 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/slowdawn-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Minako grabbed her shoes and slipped them on as she ran out the door. 
She caught up with Furiko just as the younger girl separated from a 
few other friends from the freshman team.

Minako walked up behind Furiko and put an hand on one shoulder. Furiko 
beamed up at her. Minako smiled and waved her forward.

The two girls walked along the road, both listening to their 
footsteps, lost in thought.

Minako looked down a the younger girl, who looked up with an uncertain 
smile.

&quot;Thank you for walking with me today, Furiko-chan.&quot;

Furiko&#146;s smile widened. &quot;It&#146;s always my pleasure, Aino-san.&quot;

&quot;Really, I wish you would call me Minako.&quot;

&quot;Minako-san.&quot; Furiko said, quickly. 

Minako watched, as the younger girl tried to not to throw her arms 
around herself in sheer joy. Was I so easy to please? Minako thought, 
but then smiled at herself. Maybe even easier to please than that.

They walked into the park and continued down a path, until they 
reached a bench, in a sunny patch. They sat and watched the breeze 
play in the trees.

Furiko broke the silence. &quot;You said you wanted to speak to me?&quot;

Minako was startled out of her reverie. She had been thinking about 
Rei, as she had left her at the Shrine the night before. Rei&#146;s hair 
was glowing softly in the light of the sacred flame, and her face was 
flushed with passion. Standing at the door to the Flame&#146;s room, Minako 
had kissed her happily and been rewarded with that slow, stunning 
smile. Minako echoed that smile now, as she turned to the younger 
girl. Furiko looked at her with a mixture of trepidation and 
anticipation.

&quot;Do you remember what you asked me the other day?&quot;

Furiko blushed furiously ad she looked down at her hands. &quot;Yes, and 
I&#146;m sorry about that - I don&#146;t know what came over me...&quot;

Minako put a hand on her arm reassuringly. &quot;Its okay. I&#146;m not going to 
say it didn&#146;t bother me, because it did, but now...&quot; she looked up a 
the trees. &quot;Sometimes love comes from places we don&#146;t expect, you 
know, Furiko-chan?&quot;

Furiko stared at her. &quot;I don&#146;t think I understand you, Minako-san.&quot;

&quot;I mean,&quot; she smiled at the girl once more, who smiled in return, not 
even knowing why, &quot;sometimes its the little things we miss. And then 
all of a sudden, it dawns on us that what we&#146;re looking for is right 
next to us.&quot; 

Furiko&#146;s mouth dropped open and her blush deepened. Minako decided to 
stop teasing the poor girl.

&quot;Because of that question, I found someone to love that I had never 
even realized was right there. So, I wanted to thank you. And to say I 
am sorry. I can see that you really look up to me and I&#146;m grateful for 
your adulation, but I&#146;m not someone you should idolize.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Furiko now looked thoroughly confused.

&quot;I mean, Furiko, that there is someone out there for you. And I&#146;m not 
that someone.&quot; Minako&#146;s voice was gentle. She stood and held out her 
hand, helping Furiko up from the bench. They continued down the path, 
together, but separate in their own thoughts.

Furiko spoke at last. &quot;I think I understand what you&#146;re saying, 
Minako-san.&quot; Her voice was deliberate and she spoke slowly, choosing 
each word carefully. &quot;And thank you for being so kind to such a 
foolish girl.&quot; Minako opened her mouth, but Furiko help up a hand to 
stall her. &quot;I realize that you are trying not to hurt my feelings and 
I appreciate that. Thank you.&quot;

Minako let her mouth close. She shook her head in wonder. 
&quot;Furiko-chan, you really are something special. And like I said, 
someone out there is right for you. In fact, I think I know someone 
who needs a person like you in her life right now.&quot;

The two girls came around a corner to another clearing. Sitting under 
a tree were Hannah and Yuki. They looked up and greeted the two 
newcomers with enthusiasm. Minako led the way over, but remained 
standing.

&quot;Yuki-chan, as my second, I have a favor to ask of you. Furiko-chan 
here, is, as you know a really promising recruit, but she needs alot 
of work on the basics. I don&#146;t have time, what with my other duties. I 
don&#146;t want her learning any bad habits, though. Can you be responsible 
for her and make sure she gets the work she needs?&quot; Furiko watched 
Minako through this speech, her lips tightening a little, but she said 
nothing.

Yuki looked at Furiko, surprised. &quot;Of course, Minako-san.&quot; She replied 
formally, as she stood and bowed deeply. She turned to Furiko, with a 
strange expression, as if seeing her for the first time. Or, Minako 
thought, as if she was being allowed to look at her straight on for 
the first time. 

Furiko bowed formally to Yuki, then said, &quot;Yuki-sempai. I&#146;m ready to 
begin whenever you are.&quot; Yuki continued to gaze at the younger girl, 
then smiled a genuine, happy smile. 

&quot;How about now?&quot; Yuki asked. Furiko grinned at her, then at Minako and 
nodded with enthusiasm. 

The two girls took their leave, but not before Minako caught a final 
glance of Furiko, who had turned to wink at her over her shoulder. 
Minako laughed happily and sat herself down next to Hannah.

&quot;That was a really nice thing you just did.&quot; Hannah said in her soft 
voice.

&quot;Well, if you hadn&#146;t told me how Yuki-chan felt, I&#146;m not sure I would 
have figured it out. So, it was a nice thing *we* did.&quot; Minako shook 
hands with Hannah and laughed. 

When Hannah excused herself, Minako stayed where she was and watched 
the sun&#146;s rays glitter on the tree-lined trail.

The sun was turning red, reaching greedily for the horizon. She leaned 
against the tree, closed her eyes and thought about sitting here, a 
thousand years in the future, as the sun slowly set. On a pale face, 
with big dark eyes, a smile slowly dawned. Minako rose, brushed 
herself off, and headed without a backwards glance towards Hikawa 
Shrine. Her friends were waiting for her. Rei was waiting for her. The 
future was waiting for her. Minako threw her head back and laughed 
gaily, spinning in place, for all the world, just a giddy, silly girl 
in love.
