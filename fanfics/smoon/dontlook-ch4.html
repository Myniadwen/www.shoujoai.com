<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&#147;I&#146;m not very hungry now miss&#133;&#148; the next word lodged itself in 
Michiru&#146;s throat as she glanced up, not to see the friendly nurse, but 
someone in a dark hooded coat coming towards her, holding up one of 
the deadly sharp surgery knives.

&#147;time to finish the job&#133;&#148; he grated roughly, raising the blade above 
his head&#133;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147;I think not&#133;&#148; a husky voice sounded from the door, seconds before the 
dark figure was thrown into the next wall by an extremely angry blond. 
The figure wasted no time in slashing out at Haruka, catching the side 
of her jaw before he threw the woman off him, running from the room.

&#147;Haruka!&#148; Michiru screamed, keeping Haruka from going after the man by 
sitting on the older woman&#146;s stomach, wrapping her arms around 
Haruka&#146;s neck before bringing her bleeding cheek against her shoulder.

&#147;Somebody help! Help, she&#146;s bleeding!!&#148; the aqua haired woman screamed 
at the top of her lungs, feeling Haruka&#146;s arms come around her waist.

&#147;You could have been killed&#133;&#148; the blond murmured, her voice muffled by 
the darkly stained fabric of Michiru&#146;s hospital gown.

&#147;You could have been killed too.&#148; Michiru whispered back, suddenly 
blushing as the nurse who came in gaped at them, snapping her out of 
her momentary trance.

&#147;Y-you called Miss Kaioh?&#148; the nurse asked, gasping as Haruka withdrew 
her head to look at her, &#147;please, get up! We have to talk care of 
that! How did this happen?!&#148;

&#147;A-a man, he came in&#133;he was gonna kill me&#148; Michiru stuttered, unable 
to look Haruka in the eyes as the blond got up and sat on the bed, 
letting the nurse clean the cut.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry Miss Kaioh, your&#133;friend will be fine. It&#146;s not too deep&#148; 
the nurse stated coldly, leaving the room soon after without bothering 
to say goodbye.

&#147;Well that was rude&#133;&#148; Haruka snorted, lightly touching the bandaged 
spot along her jaw.

&#147;Haruka&#133;thank you&#133;&#148; the aqua haired girl whispered, causing Haruka to 
smile broadly, noticing the loss of the suffix &#145;San&#146;.

&#147;Well&#133;tell my something miss Michiru Kaioh, what are you planing to do 
when you get out of this hospital?&#148; the blond asked casually, leaning 
against the side of the bed as Michiru gathered her clothes, changing 
quickly as Ruka turned her back.

&#147;I&#133;I haven&#146;t thought of it really.&#148; Michiru murmured flippantly, 
throwing her hair over her shoulder. Haruka grinned to herself, seeing 
her opening.

&#147;Hey&#133;do that hair thing again&#133;&#148; the blond murmured as Michiru gave her 
an odd look, shrugging her shoulders before tossing her hair again, 
causing Haruka&#146;s pulse to speed up slightly, &#147;perfect&#133;&#148;

&#147;W-what&#146;s perfect?&#148; Michiru snapped, becoming tired of the blondes 
little mind games.

&#147;You are perfect, Miss Kaioh&#133;&#148; Haruka murmured, using her real name 
purposely, causing the other woman to flush slightly, &#147;I have a 
proposal for you&#148;

&#147;W-what?&#148; the younger woman flushed a deeper shade of red, stepping 
back slightly.

&#147;Nothing like that&#133;I want to make a business proposal&#133;&#148; Haruka smiled 
charmingly, sitting in the chair next to the bed as the younger girl 
paced.

&#147;So start talking&#148; the aqua haired girl snapped slightly, feeling 
cornered as she counted up the hospital bills. If she used a credit 
card, then she could be tracked&#133;and brought home.

&#147;Well, I&#146;m a photographer. I won one of the biggest companies in Tokyo 
in my field and I&#146;m in need of a new girl for our next photo shoot. So 
far, I&#146;ve got Rei Hino, Makoto Kino, Minako Aino, and Ami Mizuno. But 
I need one more&#133;I was hoping it would be you.&#148; Haruka finished, 
holding her breath.

&#147;What kind of shoot?&#148;

Haruka winced, wishing the question hadn&#146;t come up before the contract 
had been signed.

&#147;Erm&#133;bathing suit. Two weeks along the coasts&#148;

Haruka felt the sting of Michiru&#146;s palm against her skin before the 
sentence was finished.

Looking woefully at the retreating woman as a small smile came to the 
blondes&#146; face, an idea forming in her head.

&#147;Well, I&#146;ll take that as a yes.&#148; Ruka smirked, teal eyes dancing with 
wicked glee as she trailed after the other woman&#133;
