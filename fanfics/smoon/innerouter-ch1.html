<h1>Inner Crisis, Outer Conflict (part 1 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Silver Millenium shone with the gleam of polished silver, warm and 
full of light. Members of the Queen&#39;s court swept by, courtiers in 
flowing gowns or long coattails, moving in time to the music. Uranus 
sighed as she leaned on the balcony. It was all so beautiful, and so 
foreign. 

She had answered the invitation of the Queen with great reluctance. 
For the Silver Millenium she would gladly sacrifice her life, but 
this? She was not very comfortable among all these people and she kept 
looking out into the night sky where her own home floated among the 
stars. 

Music and laughter occasionally escaped from the ballroom, but it 
brought Uranus no great joy. Her place was on her own planet, not 
dancing with these, these...she sighed  again. She looked at herself, 
dressed in a long blue coat, faced with gold and brass, ruffled shirt 
and knee-high boots. It suited her. She had been fending off offers 
from potential dance partners all night long. Not the activity she was 
best at. She was a soldier, a Senshi, in the service of the Queen. Not 
a courtier. She knew her way in a battle, but found the court 
uncomfortable. 

Her sword lay comfortably on her hip and she rested a hand on the 
hilt. It had been a long evening. Uranus smiled wryly as she 
remembered the whispers that accompanied her arrival. It wasn&#39;t every 
day that one of the Outer Senshi arrived at the Silver Millenium, and 
it was even rarer for all three to gather. In fact, it had never 
before occurred. Uranus had met Pluto once before, and had only been 
to Silver Millenium one other time. No one recognized her as the 
guardian Senshi of Uranus, and that was the way she wanted it. 

The sword on her belt flashed, a bright light illuminating the 
balcony. She looked around to find the source of the light. Behind 
her, the marble pillar blocked off her view of the ballroom and she 
stepped to one side to see behind it. 

Light laughter came from behind the pillar, and Uranus sensed 
movement. She stepped around quickly and came face to face with a 
slightly shorter woman with green hair. Her dress billowed around her 
in the light breeze, which also carried the scent of flowers from her 
hair. Uranus stood and stared downwards, frankly captivated by the 
blue eyes which watched her, twinkling in the dim light. 

The woman laughed again, and made a small curtsey. &quot;Uranus,&quot; she 
acknowledged lightly. 

&quot;Do I...have we met?&quot; Uranus asked, bowing, a little disconcerted. 

Again, that laugh. &quot;In a sense. I know *you.*&quot; 

Uranus found nothing to say. She waited for the woman to speak, not 
trusting her own tongue. 

&quot;I know you have been asked this before, but would you care to dance?&quot; 
the woman inquired, a smile playing at the corner of her lips. 

Uranus found herself smiling in return. Holding out a hand, they moved 
into the ballroom as a new song began. At first their return was not 
noticed, so many dancers were on the floor, so many people moved 
about. By their third dance together, many had noticed the two, their 
bearing, their nobility. 

Queen Serenity stood and watched as the pair moved about the dance 
floor, lost in each other&#39;s presence. She smiled as the rumors and 
whispers reached even her own ears. Did she know who that tall blond 
courtier was? Who was that woman with the green hair? She smiled, but 
did not answer. 

On the dance floor, Uranus could not stop looking at her partner. They 
danced without a word, their bodies drawing closer, until the woman 
had her cheek against Uranus&#39;s neck. Uranus could feel herself flush 
with warmth and a sensation she had never before felt. 

When the dance ended, Uranus pulled away slighty. &quot;It&#39;s warm in here. 
Shall we take a walk in the garden?&quot; 

The green-haired woman nodded and they left, rumor and whisper 
trailing after them until they were long out of sight. 

********** 

They walked in silence for a time. When they reached a gazebo 
surrounded by roses, they stopped. Uranus leaned against a pillar, 
while the woman sat on a bench. 

&quot;So, how do you know me?&quot; Uranus asked bluntly, breathing in the scent 
of roses, letting them intoxicate her. 

&quot;I&#39;ll be honest.&quot; the woman replied, flashing an object in her hand. 
&quot;I cheated.&quot; She laughed again. Uranus watched, confused, as the 
mirror in the woman&#39;s hand turned towards her. She could see herself, 
small, but clear, in the mirror&#39;s depths. Uranus stood, and watched 
herself battle an entity that had entered the solar system with the 
intention of attacking the Silver Millenium. She watched herself 
defeat the entity and resume her watch. 

Uranus lifted her dark eyes to meet the bright blue ones that watched 
her. The mirror flashed again, and her sword responded in kind. 

&quot;Neptune?&quot; Uranus&#39;s voice came as if from a distance, recognizing at 
last, who her admirer was. 

The woman stood, and flipped her hair out of her face. &quot;It is very 
nice to meet you in person.&quot; She moved close to Uranus, her face 
lifted to Uranus&#39;s. &quot;And to dance with you.&quot; 

&quot;If others knew who we were, I&#39;m sure we were the talk of the room.&quot; 
Uranus smiled, her voice soft. 

&quot;Are you worried?&quot; Neptune moved a little closer. Her lips almost 
brushed those of Uranus. 

&quot;No. I think we should give them something to really gossip about.&quot; 
And Uranus lowered her lips onto Neptune&#39;s. Under the glow of the 
Silver Millenium, with other couples passing by in the moonlight, 
Neptune and Uranus kissed deeply.
