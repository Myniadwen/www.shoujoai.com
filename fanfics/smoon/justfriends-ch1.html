<h1>Just Friends</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ami sat at her desk, thinking of her English subject. She didn&#39;t hate 
the subject, but here in Japan, why would she need to learn it? Then 
again, with her wanting to become a docter, she may one day need to 
know the language.

Sighing she looked down at the blank peice of paper. A poem...That was 
her assinment. She sat there with her head in her left and twirling 
her pen in the other. And it wasn&#39;t just any poem, but one about love 
at that! Ami didn&#39;t know what to write. Sure she and Makoto dated, 
but...Ami still blushed at the thought. Then smiled as she lowered her 
let hand to look at the engagment ring. The memory was rather funny, 
actually. They both proposed on the same night. Although what shocked 
everyone was that Ami asked first. Then Makoto explained that she 
planned on doing the same thing that night and asked too. Then, later 
that night when they were alone at Makoto&#39;s...

Ami&#39;s face flushed deep crimson at the thought. She had planed on 
staying pure for her wedding night, but that didn&#39;t happen. But, she 
was in no way regretful, either...

Ami again stared at the blank paper. What could she write? True, she 
loved Makoto, but how could she put her feelings down on paper? An old 
habit of hers, she started to chew and the end of pen. But not so hard 
as it would make the pen explode.

Ami&#39;s mind began to search for a way to do this. Her mind could figure 
most puzzles such as these out. Closing her eyes, she continued to 
think about the assinment...

&quot;THATS IT!&quot; Ami said, snapping her eyes open. Taking the pen and 
begining to write a rough draft, Ami realized it didn&#39;t have to be a 
oh-how-I-love-you-let-me-count-the-ways poem. Just a simple one would 
do. Which was good since Ami&#39;s mind thought simple. She very rarely 
brought more work on herself unless she needed to. Deep down, Ami was 
just as lazy as Usagi in most cases. MOST cases...



A few days later, after turning her poem in, Ami got it back. An &quot;A+&quot; 
of course. Still smiling at her poem, and not looking where she was 
going, she litterally ran into someone.

Feeling embaressed, Ami quickly stood and bowed. &quot;Gomen Nassi. I did 
not see you.&quot;

Then that dark, silken voice she loved to hear spoke. &quot;It&#39;s ok, 
Ami-chan. I&#39;m alright. I love bumping into the girl that I love.&quot; Then 
smiling slyly, &quot;Except, I prefer to be on top next time, if you don&#39;t 
mind.&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes went wide and she blushed. Makoto stood and looked 
at her blushing bride-to-be. &quot;So, why were you smiling about?&quot;

Forgetting those deep emerald eyes and remembering the poem, Ami 
handed it to her. &quot;It was an assinment I had to do.&quot;

&quot;I take it you passed with flying colors.&quot; Ami nodded, blushing at the 
statement. &quot;Can I see it?&quot;

Ami hesitated. &quot;If I show it to you, you have to promise not to laugh. 
It&#39;s not very good.&quot;

Makoto sighed. &quot;Ami-chan,&quot; she said, placing an arm around her 
girlfriend&#39;s shoulders. &quot;I would never laugh at you. May I please read 
it?&quot;

Nodding, Ami handed her the paper. Smiling, Makoto took it and began 
to read it to herself. After reading it, Makoto looked at Ami wih no 
expression. By this time,while Makoto was reading the poem, Ami guided 
them to Makoto&#39;s apartment. 

Standing outside the door, Ami asked, &quot;You didn&#39;t like it, did you?&quot;

Not answering, Makoto opened the door to her aprtment and she and Ami 
walked in. Closing the door and hanging her coat, Ami asked again. 
Slowl turning to face her, Makoto&#39;s face this time held a smile. 
Stepping closer to Ami, she captured her lips with her own. Ami 
dropped her school bag and wrapped her arms around Makoto&#39;s neck.

Sighing, Ami moved her head so Makoto could kiss down her neck. 
Smiling, Makoto picked Ami off the floor and kissed her. Still kissing 
her, Makoto walked to her bedroom and with one swift kick, slammed the 
bedroom door...

On the floor next to the front door, lay the poem Ami wrote. Angels 
from up above smiled at the kind, simple words:

Just Friends

I never meant to love you
It happend quite by chance
I wanted just to be your friend
Not share a new romance

But something happend suddenly
Before my heart could know
I came to know a side of you
That caused my love to grow

The tender way touch me
I pray will never end
A miracle of circumstance
My lover, my bestfriend.
