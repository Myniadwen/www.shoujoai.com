<h1>Plus de Compassion (More Than Sympathy) (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/plusde-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Spring went on and the days got longer and hotter. All trees were now 
green in whole Japan and all flowers stood in blossom. Birds sung 
happily and the sun shone from an endless sky. As always it was busy 
in the city of Tokyo. It was late afternoon and most people run by 
hectically. Some went back from work some went to work. Some simply 
went from one work to another. But other people seemed to have time. 
They walked along the small shops and looked into the windows. Or they 
ate in romantic restaurants. Some of them were tourists. Some of them 
were pensioner and some were teenagers who didn&#146;t have any school this 
day.

&#147;You spent your whole money for that silly toy! I am not stupid! I 
won&#146;t invite you to an ice cream!&#148; shouted a girl and her long dark 
hairs flew behind her as she chased another girl with two blonde 
plaids. &#147;And now give me back my bag!&#148;

&#147;But you promised me yesterday to give me an ice cream!&#148; responded the 
blonde but didn&#146;t stop her run.

&#147;That was before you ruined my red skirt!&#148;

&#147;But it was just cola and it wasn&#146;t my fault. I couldn&#146;t see the 
root.&#148;

&#147;You couldn&#146;t?! Open your eyes, you blind, stupid...&#148;

&#147;AH!!!!&#148; The blonde raised her arms in protection but it was too late. 
She couldn&#146;t stop anymore. With a scream she crashed into the girl who 
sat near a shop window and looked at the jewellery inside. The blonde 
landed on the other girl&#146;s lap and the wheelchair started to move. The 
street was steep and slowly they both rolled backwards. Fast they 
reached speed and Michiru tried to catch the wheels. But the blonde 
did hinder her and so she couldn&#146;t stop that damn vehicle.

&#147;You jerk!&#148; The dark haired girl shouted and tried to follow them. But 
she wasn&#146;t fast enough. A tall girl with long brown hairs and a 
different school uniform overtook her and was some seconds by the side 
of the wheelchair. Her strong hands grabbed the handlebars and with 
all her powers she forced the wheelchair to stop.

&#147;That was tight!&#148; she declared and took a deep breathe.

&#147;You baka! You idiot!&#148; The black haired girl soon reached the 
wheelchair and looked very angry down at the shocked blonde. Her big 
blue eyes filled quickly with tears and she started to sob.

&#147;Gomen.&#148; Another girl came to them and bowed politely. Her shoulder 
long blue hairs covered her face but Michiru could see that she felt 
really ashamed. Her skin was redden.

&#147;Gomen!&#148; The other two bowed too, just the blonde didn&#146;t get from her 
lap. She just sat there, crying in silence.

&#147;Hey, stop crying, you baka! All you do is chaos!&#148; The dark haired 
girl grabbed the blonde and shook her head in disbelieve. &#147;Do you know 
what could have happen to you and her?!&#148;

&#147;Gomen...&#148; whispered the blonde and cried even more.

Michiru raised her head and recognized the four girls standing around 
her. She remembered a cold winter&#146;s day with a snow battle when those 
girls brought a shinning light into her dark life.

&#147;Ami was right. You&#146;re always as crazy as then.&#148; Said Michiru and 
helped the blonde from her lap. She giggled as she saw that the others 
recognized her, too. Ami blushed even more and the black haired girl, 
Michiru remembered her called Rei, looked even angrier. Usagi, the 
clumsy creature, cried more. She went on her knees and grabbed Rei&#146;s 
red skirt to dry her face. Rei started to argue again as she heard the 
blowing noise from the younger girl&#146;s nose and chaos was again 
perfect.

&#147;You baka! First you splash it with cola and now with your bloody... 
Oh, you disgusting little...&#148;

&#147;But, Rei... waahhhh!!!&#148;

Makoto saved the moment when she stepped protectively between the two.

&#147;May we invite you to an ice cream?&#148; asked Ami and bowed before the 
giggling Michiru. Her face was still red but a honest smile laid on 
it.

&#147;An ice cream?&#148; asked Usagi and suddenly forgot to cry. &#147;I wanna one, 
too.&#148;

&#147;But you don&#146;t have the money for.&#148; Remembered Rei and Usagi 
immediately started to cry again.

&#147;You&#146;re so...&#148;

&#147;It would be an honour for me.&#148; Responded Michiru and giggled again. 
&#147;When I am allowed to invite this nice girl to an ice cream, too.&#148; The 
young violinist giggled more as Usagi rose from the ground, came over 
to her and wrapped her arms around her chest.

&#147;She&#146;s a friend.&#148; She declared and the tears dried quickly on her now 
smiling face. Challenging she looked at Rei who just took a deep 
breathe. &#147;She&#146;s so much nicer to me than you are!&#148;

At that moment Rei screamed again and the two girls chased again after 
each other. Ami blushed again while Makoto just shook her head in 
disbelieve.

&#147;They&#146;re so terrible.&#148; She declared and sighed worn-out.

&#147;But you like them.&#148; It wasn&#146;t a real question. Michiru knew that the 
tall girl did and she understood why. Maybe the girls argued quite a 
lot, but they were the deepest friends. They were there when they were 
needed.

&#147;Hai.&#148; Sighed Makoto but her smile betrayed her feelings.

&#147;What are you waiting for?&#148; Ami took her book again in her bag. &#147;When 
we don&#146;t hurry they both eat the ice cream all alone.&#148;

Michiru and Makoto giggled happily and the three followed the other 
two.

***

Her face got more worried with every minute. She wanted to meet her 
girlfriend at six near the huge park and now it was almost seven and 
there was no sign of her.

I&#146;ve been late, too.

Haruka clenched her fists while she walked along the street near the 
park. Small shops passed by as her steps got faster with every minute. 
She was there half past six. The car wasn&#146;t ready when she wanted to 
pick it up and she waited until the mechanics finished. Because she 
needed the car today.

&#147;And then Usagi stumbled over her own feet and fell into the water. It 
was in the middle of February and it was very cold. Can you believe 
how loud she screamed?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s unbelievable that I am not deaf now.&#148;

&#147;That sounds as if it was great fun for me!&#148;

Haruka stopped as she heard the exited voices. She looked around and 
saw her girlfriend sitting on a big table outside an Italian 
restaurant. Soft wind played with her sea green hairs and she wore the 
dark red summer dress she bought one week ago. 

She&#146;s so beautiful in it!

Haruka stepped nearer and didn&#146;t even mention the four girls sitting 
on the table, too. Nor did she mention the other girl who followed her 
since she left her car.

She&#146;s always beautiful, my Michi-chan.

Haruka embraced her girlfriend from behind and gave her a quick kiss 
on the cheek. She felt how Michiru winced surprised and then giggled. 
The young racer took a small box out of her blue jeans and hold it up. 
&#147;Happy birthday, Michi-chan.&#148; She whispered and looked into surprised 
blue eyes.

&#147;Did anyone say birthday?&#148; shouted a blonde girl from behind and 
stepped next to Michiru. Her long hairs covered her back and her light 
eyes sparkled. &#147;You have birthday?&#148; she asked and it looked as if tiny 
hearts danced in her shinning eyes. A light red shape covered her now 
exited face. Ami blushed again but Usagi only giggled as Minako raised 
one hand and pointed up to the cloudless sky above. &#147;Let&#146;s party!&#148; she 
shouted and no one doubted that she would organise a great party.

&#147;What is it?&#148; Curiously Usagi leaned forward and ignored the warning 
looks of Rei although the black haired girl looked very curious, too. 
While Minako run through the Italian restaurant to organise a great 
Happy Birthday Dinner Michiru unwrapped the tiny box. Her heart beat 
increased as she opened it and she held her breathe as she saw the 
wonderful ear rings. The silver sparkled in the sunlight. Little 
diamonds formed tiny fishes. Happily they seemed to swim through deep 
water. Happily and free. Their eyes were made of rubies and it seemed 
as if they looked understanding at her. Michiru raised her head and 
the fishes started to dance through the air. Each one was connected to 
a tiny chain which leaded to the plug that was another white jewel. It 
sparkled in all lights of the rainbow.

&#147;Arigato, Ruka.&#148; Whispered Michiru and suddenly tears filled her eyes. 
She was not only grateful for the wonderful present. She was also 
touched that her girlfriend remembered her birthday. Actually Michiru 
only mentioned it by the way two years ago. After the accident she 
wanted to forget about it, because she knew that she would never be 
able to celebrate it with her parents, again. But Haruka remembered it 
and together with those nice girls her birthday became to something 
special again.

It seemed as if Haruka wanted to say anything more, but she was 
interrupted by Usagi who rose from her chair and looked curiously at 
the ear rings.

&#147;They are so beautiful!&#148; she shouted and her big eyes stared at the 
sparkling diamonds. &#147;I wish I had such a nice boyfriend who would give 
me such nice presents to my birthday!&#148; dreamed the blonde and her face 
got angry again when she heard Rei&#146;s cold voice: &#147;There&#146;s no boy who 
would ever survive your clumsy character!&#148;

&#147;But one day I&#146;ll be a fantastic bride and then we will live together 
for all times. And I wanna a daughter.&#148;

&#147;But before you should finish school.&#148; Warned Ami and looked up from 
her book. She obviously forgot her learning the next few minutes and 
stared at the ear rings, too.

&#147;And don&#146;t think we&#146;re going to baby-sitting your daughter!&#148; answered 
Rei and Usagi looked even more hurt.

&#147;But she will be a nice child. Just like me.&#148;

&#147;Hai, that&#146;s what I was afraid of.&#148;

&#147;Oh, Rei!&#148;

&#147;Oh, baka!&#148;

Again they argued and Makoto laughed happy about them. Then she joined 
Minako and helped her to set the dinner on the table. Haruka took one 
chair and sat down next to her girlfriend.

&#147;Happy birthday to you...&#148; started the girls to sing as Makoto put 
down the huge cake. It was covered with several burning candles. There 
were too less, but it didn&#146;t matter.

&#147;Is that for me?&#148; asked Michiru and two tears run down her redden 
cheeks as she watched the singing and laughing girls around the table.

Haruka looked at her Michiru and smiled as the girl leaned forward in 
her wheelchair and blew the candles out with one big breathe. The 
girls cheered and then they begun to eat.

It&#146;s so good that she&#146;s not so sad anymore.

The young racer watched the other girls, then she took herself a tiny 
piece of the cake. She wasn&#146;t very hungry but she knew it would have 
been impolite not the eat the birthday cake the others had organised.

It&#146;s so good that she sees that there are other girls who like her the 
way she is. Who accept her without any consequences. Who simply take 
her into her community. Her. And me, too...

Minako put a CD player, no one knew where she suddenly get it from, on 
the next table and loud music started to fill the air around the 
restaurant.

&#147;Let&#146;s party&#148; she screamed and danced happily around the table.

And they had a great party.

***

&#147;There&#146;s another present I wanna give to you.&#148; Declared Haruka as they 
entered the parking space near the park. The other girls went home and 
it was now very late. It was Friday and so they wouldn&#146;t have much 
anger with their parents for being home so late.

&#147;More presents? I guess I can&#146;t carry any more.&#148; Laughed Michiru and 
pointed at the several gifts down in her lap. The girls got them from 
somewhere. Time by time one girl disappeared and came back after 
twenty minutes with a small present. She got a book about Shakespeare, 
a necklace that was a strong talisman which should protect her against 
all bad forces of this world, a big teddy bear, a CD of the newest boy 
group and a self made bread that smelled delicious.

And my ear rings...

Haruka took the presents into a bag and put it carefully on the back 
seat. Then she opened the door and took Michiru into her strong arms.

&#147;Hey, I can do this by myself.&#148; Protested the young violinist and 
shook her head. &#147;And you use the wrong side!&#148; Her deep blue eyes grew 
wide as she sat on the driver&#146;s seat. There were different apparatuses 
around her she didn&#146;t know. Haruka drove the car for so many months 
now but Michiru was sure that she had never seen one of the switches 
before.

&#147;What...&#148; she whispered as Haruka sat down next to her and reached for 
the safety belt.

&#147;You&#146;ll drive.&#148; Declared the young racer simply and smiled as she saw 
the still confused look on her girlfriend&#146;s face. &#147;This switcher&#146;s for 
the gas, this one is the break. You don&#146;t have to use a dome, this car 
has automatic. You only turn the key around, then you push the 
switcher from you and you drive. If you wanna break then pull it to 
your body. The rest of the car is handled with the steering wheel and 
the several buttons around.&#148;

&#147;But...&#148; whispered Michiru and her trembling hand touched the 
switcher. She pushed it and cut see how the accelerator next to her 
weak legs moved. Then she pulled the switcher and the break moved.

&#147;Hey, you&#146;re fifteen now, soon you&#146;re able to drive a car and I wanna 
you to drive already perfectly before you start learning in it such a 
damn school where the teachers or the examiner are prejudiced.&#148; 
Declared Haruka and gave her the car keys.

&#147;Just some circles on the parking space. So that you can get used to 
the feeling. Here nothing will happen and at this time no one is here 
who could hinder you.&#148; Calmed Haruka her girlfriend down and Michiru 
turned the key with trembling hands. The engine started and it sounded 
like the purring of a wild cat. Slowly Michiru pushed the switcher and 
the car slowly started to roll. She moved the steering wheel and the 
car turned to the right.

&#147;I am driving!&#148; shouted Michiru exited and she pushed the switcher a 
little bit more. The car got faster and at the next corner she broke 
carefully. She could hear the automatic work. Slowly she drove back to 
the start and turned the keys again. The engine died away and it was 
very silent again on the parking space.

&#147;And you told me that something was broken!&#148; she scold Haruka softly 
and the taller girl shrugged her shoulders. 

&#147;What else should I have told you? That I am going to rebuilt this car 
so that we both can drive it?&#148;

Michiru smiled then she leaned over and gave her girlfriend a quick 
kiss.

&#147;Arigato, Ruka.&#148; She whispered and looked deep into dark green eyes. 
Haruka blushed slightly and smiled tenderly.

&#147;It was your first birthday without your parents. I wanted it to be 
something special.&#148; Declared the young racer and kissed her girlfriend 
back. It was a light, soft touch. Michiru raised one hand and ran it 
through Haruka&#146;s short blonde hair. Soon it looked messed and the 
young violinist giggled.

&#147;It was, Ruka. &#145;Cause it was my first birthday with you.&#148;

Haruka reached for her and pulled her girlfriend over on her lap. Then 
she embraced her and kissed her tenderly. That kiss lasted longer then 
the first ones and Michiru giggled as it slowly ended.

&#147;I love you too, Ruka.&#148;

***

It was late in the evening when she returned to their apartment. 
Haruka yawned and took her sports bag down on the ground. The training 
for the summer&#146;s competition lasted very long and took her a long time 
to get everything ready for the next day. She hoped that her 
girlfriend didn&#146;t ask for more explanations, because it should be a 
surprise.

Haruka entered the kitchen and saw her dinner on the table. It was 
covered with a plate and the young racer could smell that it was steak 
and potatoes. She sighed and drank instead the rest of the cooled 
cola. She had been hungry some hours ago but now she was only tired. 
The last night she didn&#146;t sleep well and there were strange nightmares 
that haunted her until dawn. At school they wrote a bloody French test 
and after school there was the training. For the first time it had 
been really exhausting for her. She didn&#146;t let the others recognize it 
but her legs trembled when it was over and she climbed into her car.

Maybe it had been too hot.

Haruka put her dinner back into the fridge and went over to the 
bathroom. Quickly she took a shower and changed into her wide shirt 
she misused for a night skirt. Slowly she walked through the corridor 
over to her bedroom and hesitated. The door to Michiru&#146;s room wasn&#146;t 
closed and she could hear the boys singing sweet love songs. It was 
the CD the young violinist got from Minako to her birthday. Tempting 
Haruka looked into the darkness of her girlfriend&#146;s room and stepped 
some inches nearer before she stopped again.

&#147;Ruka?&#148; Suddenly she heard the sleepy voice and slowly she entered 
Michiru&#146;s room. She could see her girlfriend laying under a thin 
blanket. The window was wide open and the stars sparkled on a 
cloudless sky. The music died away and Michiru put away the remote 
control.

Did she wait for me?

Haruka swallowed hard and stood still hesitating in the middle of the 
room. There was the wheelchair on the other side of the bed and there 
were Michiru&#146;s clothes on the desk. Michiru lifted her blanket and 
smiled tired at the taller girl.

&#147;Come in, Ruka.&#148; She invited her girlfriend in and wrapped her arm 
with the blanket around Haruka&#146;s suddenly freezing body. It was still 
very warm but she didn&#146;t get enough sleep the last nights.

&#147;Gomen, I am so late. But the training lasted very long.&#148;

&#147;There&#146;s no need to excuse.&#148; Michiru pulled herself closer, leaned her 
head against Haruka&#146;s strong shoulder and closed her eyes. She sighed 
deeply and settled slowly into sleep. &#147;Just get some sleep and 
tomorrow we&#146;ll have a proper breakfast.&#148;

Haruka frowned then her tiredness took over the control of her body. 
She felt Michiru&#146;s warm body beside her and suddenly she felt save and 
secure.

Wanted. Needed. Loved.

***

They drove almost two hours on the highway near the sea. First Michiru 
asked a lot and was very curiously over their one day trip, but Haruka 
kept silent. She said that it was a surprise for her and she didn&#146;t 
betray anything. So the young violinist listened to the radio, watched 
the wide ocean and wondered where they were going to.

&#147;There we are.&#148; Said Haruka after they entered the parking space of a 
great arena. Michiru frowned and got into the wheelchair her 
girlfriend brought out of the boot. It was another warm day of a nice 
summer and today she wore a white skirt covered with flowers. Her 
summer hat covered only partly her long sea green hairs. Haruka wore 
her short blue jeans and a black t-shirt as always. Now she wore her 
sunglasses and her black gap again and she looked like a real tomboy.

I love this tomboy.

Michiru smiled and rolled next to her young racer as they slowly 
entered the arena.

&#147;Haruka?&#148; shouted an old man in disbelieve and the spanner landed 
loudly on the dirty ground. He run over to the tall girl and embraced 
her before she could react. &#147;I didn&#146;t know if you&#146;d really come. After 
all that happened. After all those months...&#148; declared the old 
mechanic and looked first at Haruka and then at the girl sitting in a 
wheelchair.

&#147;May I invite? Michiru, that&#146;s Ochi Yamado, my old mechanic and one of 
my best friends at the race track. Yamado, that&#146;s Kaioh Michiru. She&#146;s 
my girlfriend.&#148; Added Haruka after some seconds of hesitation and 
blushed behind her sunglasses. She wasn&#146;t ashamed of anything, she 
simply couldn&#146;t speak about her feelings so open. At least not as open 
as Michiru. And especially not as open as Usagi.

The old mechanic bowed before the handicapped girl and smiled friendly 
down at her.

&#147;So you&#146;re the one who saved my charge&#146;s life.&#148; He declared after 
Haruka had entered the box. Michiru could hear her inside but it was 
too dark than she could have seen what her girlfriend was actually 
doing. The young violinist frowned as she heard the strange words but 
the old man smiled so friendly that she couldn&#146;t be afraid of him.

&#147;Keep an eye on her, Miss Kaioh. Haruka would never admit it, but she 
needs lots of love. She simply needs the feeling of being wanted. Then 
she would walk through hell with you.&#148; The old mechanic observed the 
wheelchair for some seconds, then he nodded thoughtful. &#147;She already 
did, didn&#146;t she?&#148;

&#147;Hai.&#148; Michiru sighed then she cheered up. &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Mr. Ochi. I 
love Haruka. I am not going to leave her if it&#146;s my will.&#148; She pointed 
at the chair she was sitting in. &#147;But we can&#146;t determine our lives.&#148;

&#147;But we can give them a direction and never loose the hope for a good 
future.&#148; Declared Yamado. At that moment Haruka came out of the box 
into the shinning sun. She made a face as she pushed the heavy Suzuki.

&#147;I almost forgot how heavy she was!&#148;

Michiru stared at the motorbike with big blue eyes.

&#147;But I thought you&#146;d sold it.&#148;

&#147;Hai, I sold it to Yamado. I won&#146;t ever give her in the hands of 
strangers.&#148; Haruka took one of the two helmets from the bike&#146;s seat 
and walked over to Michiru. She gave the helmet into Michiru&#146;s icy 
hands and looked deep into confused blue eyes.

&#147;I wanna go for a ride. Do you wanna join me?&#148; she asked and smiled 
confident as Michiru stared in disbelieve at the Suzuki and than at 
her girlfriend. All she was able to do was nod although she didn&#146;t 
know how it should be possible. Her legs were paralysed. But after the 
past weeks she got to know that there was a lot possible if she only 
wanted to.

***

The wind played with her summer skirt and her sea green hairs blew 
behind her under the helmet. She had wrapped her arms around her 
girlfriend&#146;s waist. A special construction helped her staying on the 
motorbike. Haruka didn&#146;t drive so fast but it was an incredible 
feeling to drive with her along the beach. The endless sea shimmered 
next to them in the bright summer&#146;s sun. Sea birds cried above and it 
was such a lovely day Michiru automatically had to laugh.

That drive remembered her on her first meeting with her Ruka. They 
drove together almost the whole day, spend the evening in a nice caf&eacute; 
and the half of the night at the beach. They hardly talked to another 
the first days. They simply sat there, holding each other&#146;s hand or 
looking her deep into the eyes. They didn&#146;t need many words. They 
already knew about their feelings.

Michiru let go off of her girlfriend and spread her arms to feel the 
wild wind around and to hear the steady rushes of the wide ocean.

Here she didn&#146;t feel handicapped any longer. Here she wasn&#146;t a cripple 
any longer. Here she was wanted. Needed. Loved.

Free.

***

Michiru sighed as she opened the fridge to prepare their dinner. She 
didn&#146;t know when Haruka would return from their training. It lasted 
very long the last evenings and some girls complaint already that it 
was slavery what they did with their boyfriends. But Mugen Gakkuen 
wanted to win the competitions and so the pupils trained very hard.

Again she didn&#146;t eat her dinner the last day.

Michiru sighed again. She didn&#146;t even know if Haruka ate anything for 
lunch, because her drawing club started earlier the past week and the 
mornings had been too busy &#150; as always &#150; as that she could have 
watched her girlfriend eat. The young violinist shivered as she 
thought at Haruka&#146;s skinny body in the bathroom, but she actually 
didn&#146;t have the time to speak about it. There was a lot of training 
and after it Haruka was mostly too tired to talk. And when they had a 
day free Haruka surprised her and let her secret wishes become true. 
Then Michiru didn&#146;t want to ruin the day and decided to talk to her 
girlfriend the next day. And at the next day she didn&#146;t find any 
opportunity, because there was again school, tests and training.

Last weekend they went together to a quiet place at the sea and Haruka 
went swimming with her. It was the first time after the accident that 
Michiru swam into the ocean and she realized how much she missed it. 
It was a perfect weekend. And a busy week followed. Now it was already 
Friday again and Michiru didn&#146;t know what Haruka had planned for the 
next weekend. But this time, she was sure, she would talk seriously to 
her girlfriend. Even if it would ruin the nice weekend. 

Michiru prepared the salad, then she rolled over in her room. It was 
at seven and she would wait for another hour until she would eat 
something and slowly get ready for bed. Thoughtful she took the violin 
in her hands and closed her eyes. The music evolved in her head and 
she simply played it. After she swam in the swimming pool she had to 
play again. She pulled her violin out of the wardrobe where it had 
been well hidden the past months and started to play again. When 
Haruka had time she came to her and simply listened to her. She could 
do it for hours and never the tall girl looked bored. Just once she 
settled into sleep but it had been a very busy day and Michiru played 
a very slowly and very quiet melody.

&#147;Michiru?&#148;

The young violinist winced as someone touched slightly her shoulder. 
She looked up and saw a pale Rumiko standing next to her. Her eyes 
looked worried and Michiru laid the instrument carefully aside.

&#147;I didn&#146;t hear you come. What&#146;s up?&#148; she asked alarmed, because she 
didn&#146;t know how the girl got into her apartment. Nor did she like the 
concerned look of her friend&#146;s eyes.

&#147;Haruka broke down during the training. She almost fainted and didn&#146;t 
move for some minutes. The doctor couldn&#146;t find anything. He just says 
she&#146;s too tired. Maybe she didn&#146;t find enough sleep. There&#146;re the 
tests in some months and then these silly competition. All pupils say 
that the sports club is working too hard but no one hears of us. The 
teacher and I brought her home. She&#146;s now in her room. Hope she&#146;ll be 
fine soon. The doc said we should let her sleep and she shouldn&#146;t 
train the next week.&#148; Rumiko sighed and shrugged helplessly her 
shoulders. No one had ever seen strong Haruka weak. &#147;Maybe it&#146;s the 
beginning of the summer flu. Half of the school&#146;s already ill and the 
first symptoms are as light as these. But he isn&#146;t sure. Next week 
we&#146;ll know more.&#148;

Michiru didn&#146;t say anything. She just nodded and grabbed with her 
hands hard her wheels.

But I am sure. She doesn&#146;t have a flu. And even if she has one of 
those terrible nightmares she gets enough sleep. And Haruka has never 
been worried about an exam.

&#147;Arigato, Rumiko, for bringing her home.&#148; Said Michiru and didn&#146;t even 
mention that she called this apartment home. It was for the first 
time.

&#147;You needn&#146;t thank me. You&#146;re so nice friends and I am really 
concerned if you&#146;re feeling ill. You&#146;ve got my number. If anything&#146;s 
wrong or if you need any help, just call me.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re a good friend. Rumiko.&#148;

&#147;I hope so.&#148; The girl laughed as she stepped out at the corridor. 
&#147;Best wished to Haruka.&#148; Rumiko knew that Haruka was a girl and she 
knew that they both were in love with each other. But she stayed their 
loyal friend and left the rest of the pupil in the believe that Haruka 
was a boy. For her privacy was really important. Her father was a 
politician. She knew too well what happened if anyone broke the 
privacy and brought it into the public. Families could be separated 
and whole lives could be destroyed with one single word.

&#147;I do.&#148; Michiru waved shortly then she closed the door. She took a 
deep breathe and looked over to Haruka&#146;s room. The door was open and 
she could see the red light of the setting sun covering the white 
carpet. Slowly Michiru rolled over and entered her girlfriend&#146;s room. 
Haruka laid on her bed. Her hairs were wet and she already wore her 
wide shirt. Her naked legs were covered with the thin blanket. She had 
spread her arms and stared obstinately at the white ceiling. She 
breathed hard as if she run a long way and suddenly she looked very 
alone. Almost lost.

&#147;Ruka?&#148; Michiru rolled nearer and could see how the young racer 
blinked. As if she would awake from a deep dream. As Haruka turned her 
head and stared now at her girlfriend the young violinist knew that it 
had been a really bad nightmare. &#147;Do you want anything for dinner?&#148;

Haruka shook her head, then she stared back at the ceiling. 

&#147;When did you eat your last proper meal?&#148; asked Michiru quietly. Her 
voice didn&#146;t charge her. It didn&#146;t sound angry or disappointed. It 
simply sounded concerned. And understanding.

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148; Whispered Haruka after a while Michiru waited 
patiently for an answer. Haruka kept staring on the ceiling and it 
didn&#146;t look as if she was going to do anything else for the rest of 
the night. Dark shadows under her eyes betrayed Michiru that the young 
racer wouldn&#146;t find any sleep &#150; as the last night, too.

&#147;But you have to eat. Otherwise your body&#146;s going to be weaker with 
every week and breakdowns like today will be more often. Until you 
won&#146;t have any power at all. Do you really want to sit in such a 
bloody wheelchair, too, because your legs simply don&#146;t have the 
strength anymore to hold your body, even if you weigh too less for 
your seize?&#148; Michiru&#146;s voice was still very calm and so warm. She 
reached for Haruka&#146;s hand and the young racer could feel tears burning 
in her eyes. &#147;If you don&#146;t change your way of life, you&#146;ll starve to 
death, Ruka. And I don&#146;t wanna lose you. You&#146;re the most important 
person in my life. What shall I do without you?&#148;

Haruka swallowed hard and closed her eyes.

&#147;But I don&#146;t wanna this body. When I eat I am thicker and I have more 
female outlines. Then my breasts are bigger and it&#146;s harder to hide 
them any longer. And when I start eating again I&#146;ll have my period 
again.&#148;

Michiru kept silent. Shocked that she didn&#146;t see how much Haruka 
suffered during the past weeks. Okay she mentioned that the young 
racer wasn&#146;t very happy about her period but she had never thought 
that she would start starving only to get rid of it.

&#147;How many weights did you loose since January?&#148; she asked very 
silently and held the suddenly ice cold hand tight.

&#147;About twenty pound. Or twenty five. I don&#146;t know.&#148; Haruka sighed 
worn-out and tears burned behind her lashes. But she didn&#39;t allow them 
to fall. She heard how Michiru gasped for breathe but she felt so 
tired that she didn&#146;t even think of running away.

I was so blind. Me and my bloody self pity!

Michiru clenched her fists around her girlfriend&#146;s hand and lowered 
her head. Her sea green hairs fell over her shoulders and her pale 
face disappeared into shadows. &#147;Why?&#148; was all she asked.

&#147;Because my father always wanted a boy who could overtake the family&#146;s 
tradition and honour. After my birth my mother became very ill and 
wasn&#146;t allowed to get any more babies. It was a wonder that she 
survived all those years and finally died on Christmas when I was five 
years old. After that day my father raised me like a boy. I should 
full fill his dream of being the best motorbike racer in Japan, guess 
even in the whole world. Often he called me his good boy and 
introduced me to other persons as his son. First it didn&#146;t matter to 
me. But when I got older I recognized that he only loved me when he 
thought of me as a boy. Guess he recognized that I am a girl when I 
met you, Michi-chan. I fell in love with you and wanted you to be my 
girlfriend. My father went mad and took me home and he never gave me 
the chance again to escape. He beat me for more than just one time 
when I couldn&#146;t reach his dream. And more than once he beat me because 
I am a girl. I started to hate my body and it got worse when I grew 
up. Those silly things...&#148; she pointed with her free hand on her 
breasts under the wide cloth and sighed. &#147;They grew, too. I don&#146;t need 
them. I&#146;ll never feed a child with them, because I&#146;ll never have an 
own child. I would be a terrible mother and after all I&#146;ll never sleep 
with a boy.&#148; She sighed and it sounded very tired. &#147;And then I got my 
first period. The pain didn&#146;t matter that much, but I hated the idea 
that I was now able to get an own child and... hell, I was so ashamed 
of it, Michi-chan!&#148; Haruka pulled her free arm over her face but 
Michiru could see two tears running down her girlfriend&#146;s pale face.

&#147;But that&#146;s all part of you.&#148;

&#147;It isn&#146;t, Michi-chan. All at school think I am a boy. Remember 
Ayako&#146;s hateful looks when she got to know the truth about my gender.&#148;

Michiru looked silently at her girlfriend, then she let go of the now 
warm hand and leaned forward. Slowly she unbuttoned Haruka&#146;s wide 
shirt and tenderly she caressed over Haruka&#146;s naked, skinny body.

&#147;Believe me, it&#146;s all part of you. Your breasts...&#148; she heard her 
girlfriend&#146;s gasp as she touched the intensive skin. &#147;... your female 
outlines...&#148; she caressed her girlfriend&#146;s hips. &#147;... and your period 
as well.&#148; Haruka took away her arm but she didn&#146;t defend herself. She 
simply stared at Michiru and tears were shimmering in her dark green 
eyes. Suddenly she looked weak and helpless. The young violinist had 
never seen her that way before and it almost made her heart break.

&#147;You&#146;re a girl, Ruka. You won&#146;t change your gender just by stopping to 
eat. That will lead you to nothing, only to death some day. Sooner 
than later.&#148; Michiru swallowed hard and touched the ribs under the 
thin skin. &#147;You don&#146;t have to be a boy, Haruka. I love you the way you 
are. I love you being a girl. I love your character but I also love 
your body.&#148; Michiru whispered and tears burned in her eyes, too. &#147;And 
you&#146;re very attractive, Ruka.&#148; The young violinist smiled a sad smile. 
&#147;Please don&#146;t leave me, Ruka. I need you.&#148; Michiru&#146;s voice shook and 
with a last whisper it broke: &#147;I love you so much, Ruka.&#148; Then she 
buried her burning face at her girlfriend&#146;s slim belly and started 
desperately to sob. Haruka laid there motionless and listened to her 
for some moments.

What have I done?

As for so many questions she couldn&#146;t find an answer.

At last she could free herself out of her trance. She reached for her 
Michi-chan and pulled her out of the wheelchair. She hold her tight 
with the rest of strength and searched for her mouth. The kiss was 
full of desperate passion and it tasted salty. Both of their cheeks 
were wet as they finally separated partly. Haruka held her girlfriend 
so tight as if she didn&#146;t ever want her to let go. And Michiru didn&#146;t 
want to leave this bed either.

&#147;It sounds so simple when you talk this way.&#148; Declared Haruka silently 
after a while they simply hold each other tight. &#147;But I fear it isn&#146;t 
as simply as that.&#148;

Michiru looked up to her and gave her another sweet kiss. Then she 
pointed at her weak, useless legs and at the wheelchair beside the 
bed.

&#147;We went more than once through hell and survived it every time. Why 
shouldn&#146;t we handle this situation, too?&#148; she asked and wiped tenderly 
away Haruka&#146;s tears. &#147;You showed me with your love that I am not a 
bloody cripple. Why can&#146;t I show you with my love that you&#146;re the most 
beautiful and most attractive girl I&#146;ve ever seen?&#148;

&#147;I am not sure if I can believe it.&#148;

Michiru smiled an understanding smile and stroke through he short 
blonde hairs.

&#147;I know it&#146;s hard to believe in anything when you&#146;re down. When you 
dig in the dirt and can&#146;t see any light in your bloody dark life. But 
one thing is for sure: I&#146;ll never let you down, Ruka. I&#146;ll never let 
you go. You promised me never to leave me. I never promised anything 
but you should know that I would never leave you alone. As long as I 
live.&#148;

Haruka smiled though her tears and kissed her girlfriend again.

Those words were indeed something she was able to believe in.

***

&#147;It&#146;s another nice Saturday. I called Rumiko and she wants to join us 
if we want to go to the beach.&#148; Declared Michiru as Haruka entered the 
kitchen. It was noon but Haruka still wore her wide shirt. Her hairs 
were messed and she still looked very tired. The young violinist 
smiled as Haruka yawned and sat down on the table. She loved those 
private moments. They insured her that her Ruka trusted her. That they 
were kind of a small family...

&#147;Sure. Everything is fine.&#148; Whispered Haruka and almost fell into 
sleep again as Michiru set the table. It smelled delicious and 
suddenly Haruka asked herself when she enjoyed the last time one of 
her girlfriend&#146;s meals. In the evenings she only pushed them back into 
the fridge and at the past weekends they had been too busy.

&#147;What are you cooking?&#148;

&#147;Okonomiyaki.&#148; Declared Michiru and giggled proudly as she saw how 
Haruka looked up in surprise. Her dark green eyes were still sleepy.

&#147;You&#146;re lucky that I didn&#146;t try it. It sounds very complicate. And it 
sounds as if it could burn easily.&#148;

&#147;Oh, it&#146;s easy &#150; if you&#145;re able to handle the cooker.&#148;

&#147;I am a lousy housewife.&#148; 

&#147;You have other qualities.&#148;

Haruka had the politeness to blush.

&#147;Dinner&#146;s ready.&#148; Michiru looked into the oven while Haruka opened the 
water bottle. &#147;Do you want anything?&#148; The young car racer raised her 
head as she heard her girlfriend&#146;s suddenly very uncertain voice. 
Haruka took a deep breathe. Then she looked at the delicious smelling 
okonomyaki and her belly started to protest that she couldn&#146;t waste 
it.

The young car racer tried hard to ignore the memory of her body in the 
bathroom&#146;s mirror. Then she remembered her Michi-chan who obviously 
loved the body she hated so much.

Again Haruka looked at the dinner again and into deep blue eyes. Then 
she lowered her head and nodded.
