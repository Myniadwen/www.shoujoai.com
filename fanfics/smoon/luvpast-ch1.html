<h1>Lovers of the Past</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/psychokitten.html">PsYcHoKiTtEnSeNsHi611</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	The club was as packed as it possibly could be on a Saturday night.  A 
young woman, short black hair shining even in the dim light, slid up to the 
bar, her long skirts flowing as she sat on a stool.  She was an eye-catcher 
in that beautiful black dress, the short sleeves revealing delicate white 
flesh on her arms, the wrinkled skirts flowing up every so often and would 
reveal glimpses of little white ankles.  Her small feet were covered by 
little black shoes, matching the dress with perfection.  Her gloves where 
white with a black rim around the wrist, completing the delicate ensemble.
	She was gorgeous.
	But, somehow, she managed to fade into the background of the dancers, 
her small frame blending in with some strange force into the area of the bar.  
She would glance around, noticing people who stood out more than others, but 
they did not notice her.  No matter how gorgeous she was.
	The swing music emerged from the large band, beckoning her onto the 
wooden dance floor.  She did not comply.  She would tap her feet and shake 
her small hips on her stool, but she did not dance.  The bartender noticed 
her by accident, staring off into space and catching a glimpse of shining 
black hair.  He focused fully on her, in all her glory, as she threw her head 
back, her entire body shaking to the intoxicating music.  His young body 
could not deal with this beauty, and his knees shook in his new pinstriped 
suit.
	She was gorgeous.
	But, she would not dance.
	Something caught this black beauty&#39;s eye, and she glanced in the 
direction of it.  A whir of pink, followed by the swishing of white skirts, 
and the bubbling sound of beautiful laughter.  She was transfixed at the 
sight before her.  Long pink hair flowing as beautifully as the white skirts 
that whirled around her ankles.  Small white-clad feet tapped expertly on the 
dance-floor, and were swept upward as this flower&#39;s partner lifted her up and 
swung her around.  Flips, dips, whirls, and turns...this beauty was not to go 
unnoticed.  To our little black darling, though, she was something much more.
	She was gorgeous.
	&quot;Bartender!&quot;  The small voice dripped with urgency and need.  The young 
man, intoxicated by her and his self-esteem rising, hurried over to her, his 
eyes not leaving the front of her dress.
	&quot;Yes?&quot;  He replied, in a slightly seductive tone.
	She either ignored it or didn&#39;t notice.  &quot;Who is that woman, over 
there?&quot;  A long, white-gloved hand motioned to the pink-haired seductress.
	&quot;Oh, you mean Bunny?&quot;  He smiled, memories flooding his mind.
	&quot;Bunny...&quot; The black-haired woman rolled it around on her tongue.  &quot;Is 
that her real name?&quot;
	&quot;Yes,&quot; he smiled again.  &quot;Well, her real name is Little Rabbit, but 
everyone calls her Bunny.&quot;
	&quot;Oh,&quot; came the reply.  &quot;I see.&quot;  She hadn&#39;t looked at the young man the 
entire time, her eyes transfixed on Bunny.  Something about her enchanted our 
black beauty, and made her want to walk up to her and kiss that pink haired 
rabbit right in the middle of the dance floor, filled with people.  Something 
about this little rabbit made her want to get off of her stool of safety and 
enter her world.
	The bartender leaned over the counter, trying to catch her attention.  
&quot;And what,&quot; he began, &quot;is your name?&quot;
	She turned back to him slowly, wondering what to say.  &quot;My name?&quot;  She 
said again, and her mind cleared for a second.  &quot;Oh.  I&#39;m Firefly.&quot;
	He smiled.  &quot;Glad to meet you, Firefly.&quot;
	Engrained politeness forced her to smile back at him and clear her 
throat.  &quot;And what, may I ask, is your name?&quot;
	He smiled wider, glad she was showing interest in him.  &quot;I&#39;m Seiya.&quot;
	The strangeness of his name made her take a closer look at him.  He was 
really quite handsome, large navy blue eyes whose depths could sink a woman 
daring enough to wade into their waters.  She took in the sharp angles of his 
face, the short and stylish hair cut, and the well-tailored suit that he 
wore.  Over the high counter on the bar she couldn&#39;t see much else, even if 
she had been standing.  She blushed a little in spite of herself, noticing 
finally that he was VERY interested in her.  &quot;That&#39;s an interesting name...&quot; 
She commented, trying to break the still air between the two.
	&quot;I know.  I don&#39;t know what my parents were thinking!&quot;  He chuckled, 
and she joined in, relieved.  &quot;What brings you here tonight, Firefly?  Here 
for the dancing, the music,&quot; he paused, weighing his words carefully.  &quot;Or 
are you meeting someone?&quot;
	She blushed again.  This wasn&#39;t working out well.  &quot;No, I&#39;m not meeting 
anyone at all.&quot;  She turned away from his now eager eyes, just in time to 
catch a glimpse of that whirl of pink before it slammed into her.
	The entire ordeal was utterly embarrassing.  Bunny had been dancing, 
just having a good time, when suddenly her partner decided to try out a new 
move.  He had wanted to throw her up in the air and catch her as she spun 
down into his arms, but it hadn&#39;t quite worked out the way he had wanted it 
to.  He had thrown her, all right, but she was so surprised she had pulled 
away in mid-air, and ended up going backwards and slamming, quite painfully, 
into the bar.  Now she lay sprawled on top of someone she didn&#39;t recognize, a 
stool going painfully into her hip, and her hair caught underneath someone 
else&#39;s foot.  Or maybe it was her foot.  She couldn&#39;t tell.  She knew it was 
caught somewhere, though.
	Firefly groaned at the weight that pressed down on her.  She rubbed her 
head with her left hand and sat up on her right elbow before opening her 
eyes.  The mysterious girl, Bunny, was inches from her face, red eyes staring 
into dark purple ones.
	She screamed.
	Bunny, more than just a little perplexed, covered her ears and squeezed 
both eyes shut.  When the loud noise finally stopped, she opened one eye, 
making for a very cute little figure.  When she saw the somewhat startled and 
very beautiful Firefly before her, however, she opened both eyes again, and 
stared.
	The moment was awkward.  Dark purple staring into dark red, both women 
sprawled out on the floor with a couple stools between them.  It seemed like 
an eternity before Seiya ran to help both of them up...yes, an eternity, a 
wonderful and blissful eternity that sparked something between two very 
beautiful young women.  Seiya brought them both into a back room to tend to 
their wounds, but they had just barely noticed them.  All they saw was dark 
purple and dark red.  That&#39;s all.
	Oh!  She was so beautiful!  Bunny had never seen such beauty wrapped up 
in one gloriously petite package.  She had never seen such a deep shade of 
purple, let alone in eyes as glorious as this.  How could she have not 
noticed this woman before?  This dark, mysterious, beautiful woman?
	Firefly was enchanted.  Perhaps it was that hair, such a cute little 
shade of pink.  Perhaps it was those eyes, red and perfect and wonderful.  
Perhaps it was the cute figure of this petite woman, shown off perfectly in 
that beautiful white dress.  Whatever it was, her senses lived in it, reveled 
in it, and wouldn&#39;t let her forget that wonderful look in those red eyes.
	Seiya sat them down on two crates in the storage room.  He watched 
them, an eyebrow raised in a silent question.  Why were they staring at each 
other like that?  He&#39;d never seen that kind of look before.  He turned their 
faces toward him, and cleared his throat.  &quot;Hey ladies, that was a pretty 
hard fall.  Are you cats alright?&quot;
	Bunny&#39;s head cleared, and she spoke up.  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m alright...just a little 
banged up.&quot;  She breathed out slowly, her face turning the same shade as her 
eyes.  &quot;And embarrassed.&quot;
	Seiya laughed.  &quot;I would be too.  But hey, that&#39;s what you get if 
you&#39;re swinging with Helios!&quot;
	Bunny sulked.  &quot;Yeah, thanks.  I feel SO much better now.&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  The soft voice emerged from the woman beside 
her, and she turned to look at her, red eyes wide.  &quot;Anyone with half a brain 
could see it wasn&#39;t your fault.&quot;  Firefly smiled.
	Bunny swallowed hard.  She was trying to fight this overwhelming heat 
that emerged from her belly when she looked at this enchantress.  &quot;Th...Thank 
you.&quot;  She swallowed hard again.  &quot;But, I apologize anyway, because I can 
tell it probably hurt!&quot;  She tried to break the mood with a small chuckle, 
and succeeded in getting a wider smile and giggle out of the other woman.
	&quot;Hey you two lovely cats, I&#39;m going to get some Band-Aids and wash-
cloths.  I&#39;ll be back in a second.&quot;  Seiya opened the door and closed it 
softly, leaving the two women in the small storage room all by themselves.
	Bunny was the first to break the silence.  &quot;Since I crashed into you 
and all...I thought it&#39;d be nice if...if we could call each other by our first 
names.&quot;
	&quot;Alright.&quot;  Firefly nodded.
	&quot;So what&#39;s yours?&quot;
	&quot;Firefly.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m...&quot;
	&quot;Bunny.  I know.&quot;
	&quot;How do you know?&quot;
	Firefly smiled.  &quot;Seiya told me.&quot;
	&quot;Oh.  You know Seiya?&quot;
	&quot;Not really.  I just met him tonight.  I asked him what your name was.&quot;
	&quot;Really?  Why?&quot;
	&quot;Because...&quot; She swallowed the lump in her throat.  &quot;I noticed you 
dancing, and thought you were the most beautiful thing I&#39;d ever seen.&quot;
	Bunny could have fainted.  She had never heard anything like that ever 
said to her before.  Where did this come from?  This overwhelming feeling 
that something was RIGHT about this?  This feeling that they had met before, 
in another time, another place?  That she had kissed this woman, held this 
woman, comforted this woman, and made love to this woman?  &quot;I...thank you.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;  Firefly turned away from those red eyes.
	&quot;You...you&#39;re very beautiful yourself, you know.  I&#39;ve never seen anyone 
like you before.&quot;  Bunny smiled.  &quot;You have very lovely eyes, Firefly.&quot;
	Firefly smiled at the complement.  &quot;Thank you, Bunny.&quot;  Doing something 
that was mainly from her instincts alone, she placed a white-gloved hand over 
Bunny&#39;s bare one, not thinking at all.  She didn&#39;t know Bunny would suck in 
her breath at the sudden contact, her chest heaving with the sweet ache of it 
all.  She didn&#39;t know the smaller, pink haired girl would lean in and kiss 
her sweetly on the lips.
	But if she had known this, she would have done it anyway.
	Bunny&#39;s lips brushed her own lightly, and she could have melted right 
onto that crate.  When they pulled away from each other, they realized what 
they had done, what they had given into, and blushed.  Firefly tried to make 
her hand pull away from Bunny&#39;s, but her body wouldn&#39;t respond.  Instead, 
taking on a mind of it&#39;s own, her hand slid around Bunny&#39;s waist and pulled 
her half on top of her.  The only slightly smaller girl had her hands in 
between them, resting just above Firefly&#39;s breasts.  Her left leg was trapped 
between Firefly&#39;s other two, pulsing with some uncontrollable heat.  
Firefly&#39;s body still in charge, she dipped her head low and kissed Bunny 
fiercely, deepening the kiss more than they both thought possible.
	Her perfume was like a drug, Bunny thought.  It got her higher than 
anything had ever before.  She couldn&#39;t imagine something that made her feel 
half this good.  What reminded her of these kisses?  She didn&#39;t know.  No one 
had ever kissed her like this, not this passionately, not this wonderfully, 
not this meaningfully.  No one had ever held her like this, so warm and 
inviting and comfortable and RIGHT.  No one had ever reminded her of home, 
not like this woman before her in the long black dress who&#39;s eyes were a deep 
purple like the endless night sky.
	When the kiss did end, they pulled away slowly, swollen lips still 
puckered.  Bunny licked her lips, tasting the sweet honey of the Firefly 
before her.  She tried, in vain, to move from her slightly uncomfortable 
condition, but her body stopped her.  She couldn&#39;t control her next move, a 
thought that would normally be scary but didn&#39;t frighten her in the least.
	&quot;Firefly, you&#39;re a wonderful kisser...&quot; Bunny&#39;s lips were mere inches 
from Firefly&#39;s.  A small hand traveled up Firefly&#39;s thigh, tickling and 
exciting at the same time.  She didn&#39;t know where her skirt began or ended, 
but realized that the way they were sitting must have folded her skirt way up 
beneath her.  That wasn&#39;t a problem, concerning the circumstances.
	The hand came to rest underneath her skirts at her hip, feeling along 
her hipbone and just below her belly button.  She kissed her Bunny once 
again, tongue diving in her mouth in a quest to quench this fire she was 
starting inside of her.
	Bunny had to retaliate.  Nothing she did seemed to affect this Firefly.  
Nothing.
	Except this.
	Her small hand slipped past her Firefly&#39;s underwear, coming in contact 
with soft and curly hair.  She ran her hand down this, feeling the two tensed 
legs spread around her in an instinctive movement.  A small finger traced its 
way down the entrance to this Firefly&#39;s cave, feeling along her most 
sensitive place.  Lying back on the crates, Firefly pulled this Bunny above 
her and kissed her again.  Fierce.  Hard.  Scared.
	Legs spread wider, giving that prying finger better access to her.  Not 
sure how to continue, Bunny traced the entrance again and again, feeling her 
finger and hand dampen with the touches.  Finally, an instinctive movement 
placed in the back of her mind from long ago made her plunge her finger into 
this Firefly, feeling the body beneath her stiffen and shudder with desire.  
Her hand plunged in and out, feeling the inner muscles of her new lover 
clench down on her finger.  The kisses became even harder, desperate pleas to 
continue, soundless gasps and moans, eyes and teeth clenched in pure 
pleasure.  The raw pleasure of it all.
	Firefly threw her head back as she continued to shudder.  &quot;Oh God...&quot; She 
moaned, arms and hands locked around Bunny&#39;s shoulders.  &quot;Oooohhhh God...&quot; She 
repeated, hips rocking and bouncing on the crates below her.  She realized, 
through the haze that pleasure brings, that she was doing nothing for this 
woman above her, nothing to please her.  Arching her back, she reached the 
neckline of her lover&#39;s dress and pulled it down slowly.
	Unsure how to go about it, she stared at the round breast before her.  
The nipple, hardened and ready for her, stuck out like a rosebud.  Instincts, 
buried in the back of her mind from a time long forgotten, made her bend her 
head down to it and begin sucking on it.
	Bunny stared down at her, feeling herself start to stiffen.  Her 
fingers began to slow their movements and eventually stopped, and she 
realized this only after Firefly tilted her head toward her and brought her 
hips to her own.  Sliding her underwear down with one hand and molding her 
breast with her other, she stared into the pink-haired lady&#39;s eyes with pure 
desire in them.  The underwear were off, and now she laid back down, 
underneath her little rabbit.
	Lowering her hips onto Firefly&#39;s, Bunny moaned.  Their skirts were 
spread out around them, still stuck around their waists.  If she could break 
this completely intimate contact she would, but now she was stuck in the 
moment, feeling the wonderful feeling of completion as they met each other 
again and again...
	Bunny kissed her lover as climax overtook them both at the same 
instant, shuddering over and over, hips rocking and bouncing back and forth 
against the crates, creating a loud amount of noise.  All Firefly could do 
was wonder where Seiya was and clutch Bunny to her, teeth clenched and 
muscles locked in the fabulous release.  They stayed like that for a long 
time, the last spasms and waves washing over them, feeling more at peace then 
they had ever felt before.  The shuddering eventually stopped, however, and 
all they could do was lay together, still clutching at each other and legs 
locked in a tight embrace.  Soft swing music filtered through the door, and 
they both smiled.
	&quot;In the Mood&quot;, by Glenn Miller and his Orchestra, was being played.  
They both knew, by some outer force, that this was right, this was a sign, 
and that they loved each other.
	It was 1938, the era of swing, and the two women were locked together 
in a tight embrace in a storage room of an underground swing club.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Oh, Taru-chan!  Come over here, quick!&quot;  Chibi-Usa called to her 
lover.  &quot;Come on!  It&#39;s our song!&quot;
	Hotaru walked into the room, an apron around her waist.  &quot;What?  I&#39;m 
baking cookies, Odango...&quot;
	&quot;I know, I know, but I want you to dance with me for a little while.&quot;  
She grabbed the black-haired girl&#39;s hands and pulled her into an intimate 
embrace.  &quot;You know, every time I hear this song, I want to hold you close.&quot;
	&quot;I know.  I feel the same way.&quot;  She kissed Chibi-Usa&#39;s cheek lightly.  
&quot;I&#39;m trying to remember, what&#39;s this song called?&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s really old, I know that for sure.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, the recording&#39;s kinda fuzzy.&quot;  Hotaru smiled at Chibi-Usa.  
Suddenly, she went weak at the knees, and sunk to the floor.
	Chibi-Usa sunk with her, still holding her close.  &quot;Taru-chan?  Are you 
alright?&quot;  Her voiced was pressed with worry.
	&quot;Yes, Odango...I&#39;m just...a little overwhelmed, that&#39;s all.&quot;  Hotaru laid 
her head on Chibi-Usa&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I just had the strangest 
thing happen...I saw us, together, only you looked like Black Lady and I looked 
kinda like Mistress 9...but we weren&#39;t EVIL...just older.  And we were dancing 
together, to this song.&quot;
	&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  Chibi-Usa looked thoughtful, suddenly catching a 
bit of the vision herself.
	&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;  Hotaru looked up at Chibi-Usa.  &quot;Maybe this has always 
been our song, Odango.&quot;
