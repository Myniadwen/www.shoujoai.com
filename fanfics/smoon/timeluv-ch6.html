<h1>No Time for Love (part 6 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Rei sighed happily and shifted her head in her arms. She was lying 
stretched out on a massage table Kira had just &#39;lying around collecting 
dust&#39;. She was naked save for a towel that was laid out across her 
backside, and was feeling quite relaxed, due in a large part to the 
absolutely incredible massage Kira had just given her. After agreeing to 
it, Kira had lead Rei and Ami into a room that was already prepped, as if 
waiting for them. Ami had taken one of the tables, and Rei another. 
After flipping a coin, Rei had gotten the honors of receiving a massage 
first. Kira had started innocently enough, rubbing Rei&#39;s back and 
shoulders firmly after she&#39;d laid face down. Once Rei had practically 
melted into the table Kira had started to rub underneath her shirt. 
Lifting it just a little and gently pressing Rei&#39;s lower back. 
Eventually she&#39;d made it all the way to Rei&#39;s shoulders, and had 
suggested that Rei just take it off completely so she could use some 
oils. To spaced to care Rei had agreed. That was how the rest had gone 
too. Kira would rub the parts with clothes on, work her way under them a 
bit, then suggest Rei take them off. Rei had only recently realized she 
was in fact completely naked, though she clearly remembered Kira rubbing 
some of her more intimate parts. Rei had made up her mind to yell at 
Kira for it, but she felt to much like jello to move right now and so 
had settled for watching Kira rub Ami down.

Almost laughing Rei watched Kira repeat the process with Ami, 
carefully,slowly, getting her to remove one piece of clothing after 
another. Kira then started in with the oils, starting by rubbing them 
into Ami&#39;s shoulders with firm circles that radiated out and in from her 
spine. Ami moaned lightly and Kira moved down, being careful while rub 
the warmed oils into Ami&#39;s butt. It felt so good that Ami didn&#39;t even 
protest, just sighed happily. Kira worked her way down Ami&#39;s firm thighs 
and calves, then rubbed a lotion into her feet. Rei quirked an eyebrow 
as Kira then turned Ami over, the towel over her waist providing the 
only cover. Rei couldn&#39;t help but let her eyes wander up Ami&#39;s lithe 
body. Her swimmer&#39;s legs, taut stomach, small pert breasts tipped with 
rose colored nipples, slightly flushed face. Letting her gaze follow 
back down her body Rei realized why Ami was so flushed. Kira had moved 
the towel up so it was resting on Ami&#39;s stomach and was calmly rubbing 
the inside of Ami&#39;s thighs. Rei felt her breathing quicken as she 
watched. Kira&#39;s hands moved slowly upwards, her fingers each working in 
small circles to ease the muscles that jumped under her touch. Ami&#39;s 
breath quickened as well when Kira&#39;s fingers reached the crease of her 
thigh, where a thin covering of panty would usually start. 

Raising her eyes up Kira smiled when she saw that Ami&#39;s eyes were 
closed. Despite the shallow breathing, Ami was incredibly relaxed, just 
as Rei had been. And just as Rei was now, Ami had been watching with 
quickened breath and a pounding heart. Lowering her eyes again Kira let 
her thumbs gently rub along the crease, and slowly slid them in more, 
rubbing just to the start of the girls outer sheath then moved up, still 
lightly rubbing until she had passed the danger zone and spread her hands 
flat to work on the girl&#39;s stomach.

Rei let out a breath she didn&#39;t know she&#39;d been holding and sighed at 
the tingling feeling in her lower region. A thought crossed her mind and 
she raised her head just enough to speak.

&quot;Oi, Mosquito-san.&quot; She called quietly enough not to disturb Ami. Kira 
didn&#39;t look up as she answered.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I thought you promised you would knock off all this seductivey stuff.&quot; 
Kira raised an eyebrow and started to gently rub Ami&#39;s breasts.

&quot;I promised not to use my powers to make you feel anything against your 
will. I hardly think Ami-chan feeling good during a full body massage 
counts. I didn&#39;t hear you complain when it was you I was touching.&quot; Kira 
teased lightly. Rei flushed but shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;m not talking about the massage. I talking about what I&#39;m feeling 
now watching you touch her.&quot; She said in all honesty. Kira tried 
desperately not to smile at that, concentrating instead on Ami&#39;s 
collarbone.

&quot;I promise you that whatever it is you are feeling watching her, it is 
not me who is responsible.&quot; Rei looked confused and shifted to her side, 
momentarily forgetting that left her front exposed.

&quot;It&#39;s got to be you doing it. Why else would I feel this way?&quot; Kira 
spared a glance at Rei&#39;s chest and the priestess quickly laid back down. 
Moving to stand behind Ami&#39;s head she began to lightly massage her face.

&quot;Maybe if you tell me how you feel, I could help more.&quot; Though a little 
embarrassed Rei still firmly believed Kira was behind the warmth and 
consequent wetness of her lower region. Knowing that Kira would only give 
in after tormenting Rei for a while, she gave in first.

&quot;I feel a warm and tingly and wet. You know, I&#39;m...horny.&quot; Kira smiled 
slightly and rubbed Ami&#39;s forehead. It was probably a good thing the 
blue-haired girl was asleep or she&#39;d be bright red.

&quot;And you didn&#39;t feel horny when I was rubbing you?&quot; Rei thought 
honestly for a moment and shook her head.

&quot;A bit nervous I think, maybe, a little excited. But not like this.&quot; 
Kira smiled more.

&quot;So you only became horny while watching Ami be...pleasured?&quot; Rei 
started and then growled lightly.

&quot;Exactly. See? It has to be you.&quot; Kira finished with Ami and after 
wiping her hands on a towel turned to look at Rei.

&quot;Once I make a promise, I keep it. What you&#39;re feeling is not my doing 
Fireball.&quot; Rei made a face and looked up at Kira curiously.

&quot;Say that again.&quot; Amused, Kira sat on a bench across from Rei and 
leanedon her knees.

&quot;What you are feeling is not my doing.&quot; Rei shook her head and looked 
upat Kira annoyed.

&quot;Say all of it. Like you first did.&quot; Leaning back Kira regarded Rei 
witha raised eyebrow.

&quot;Once I make a promise, I keep it.&quot; She repeated slowly. &quot;What you&#39;re 
feeling is not my doing Fireball.&quot; Rei made a face again and sighed. 

&quot;I guess it is me. You really did stop making us like you huh?&quot;

&quot;For the record I just made you feel more relaxed and messed with your 
inhibitions a bit. Liking me was just a side affect. And, out of 
curiosity, what made you finally believe me?&quot; Rei looked up at Kira.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I let you call me Fireball. That sounds so stupid now. 
Don&#39;t call me that anymore.&quot; Kira couldn&#39;t help but laugh at that and 
Ami stirred, turning her head to peer at them curiously.

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; Kira stopped laughed a turned to look at Ami, doing 
her best to keep her eyes on Ami&#39;s face, and not her exposed breasts.

&quot;Rei-san doesn&#39;t want me to call her Fireball anymore, she says it 
sounds stupid. Even if it does fit her. How about you? Can I still call 
you Snowflake?&quot; Rei reached out and lightly whacked Kira as Ami made a 
face.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe I let you call me Snowflake. In front of everyone!&quot; 
She laid back down on the table with a small wail and covered her eyes 
with her hands. Kira burst out into laughter again. &quot;How did you get on 
that topic anyhow?&quot; Kira looked down at Rei and couldn&#39;t help but give an 
evil grin.

&quot;Well when I called her that, she said she finally believed that I 
wasn&#39;t messing with you guys anymore.&quot; Rei thwacked Kira again and Ami 
tilted her head.

&quot;&#39;Messing with us?&#39;&quot; Kira grinned at Rei and looked at Ami.

&quot;Yeah, she thought I was still making you guys feel extra... desireful.&quot;

&quot;Why would you think that Rei-san?&quot; Rei had been in the middle of 
hissing at Kira to shut-up when Ami asked and she looked over at her 
quickly, flushing lightly.

&quot;Yeah Rei-san,why would you think that? Do you want to tell her? Or 
should I ?&quot; Rei practically growled at Kira.

&quot;Tell me what?&quot; Ami questioned suspiciously, sitting up completely, 
still not quite realizing that she had only the small towel as cover. 
Rei looked over at Ami to answer when she saw the girl sit up, now all 
but nude, and flushed heavily looking back down at the table. Feeling 
slightly miffed that Rei had thwacked her, Kira decided to torment her 
more.

&quot;Well, it seems as though while I was giving you a massage Rei started 
feeling...&quot; Kira got no further as Rei shot from the table to put her 
hand on top of Kira&#39;s mouth. Kira only raised her eyebrow in amusement 
as Ami gasped lightly in the background. Rei went beet red as she 
realized that was was now standing completely naked in Ami&#39;s direct line 
of sight, pressed up against Kira. Kira grinned broadly under Rei&#39;s hand 
and Rei removed it slowly. Ami looked over Rei almost against her will 
then realized that she too was naked. Hurriedly she grabbed the towel 
and covered her breasts, doing her best to cover herself with a hand. 
Still looking at Kira, Rei decided that teasing her wouldn&#39;t be as much 
fun for Kira if she acted unaffected and stepped back to place her hands 
on her hips.

&quot;Would you mind getting us something to cover ourselves with?&quot; She 
asked cooly. Kira took a moment to very slowly and very purposefully 
glide her eyes over Rei&#39;s form. By the time she met Rei&#39;s eyes again the 
girl was struggling to keep her calm composure and was flushed. She 
could hear Ami breathing heavily to but decided not to push it much 
more. Slowly she stood up, being sure to slink her body right next to 
Rei&#39;s, nearly pressing them together. She leaned over and whispered into 
Rei&#39;s ear.

&quot;If that&#39;s really what you want.&quot; She said quietly and pulled back 
slowly meeting the girl&#39;s eyes, &quot;I&#39;ll do anything you really want.&quot; She 
said, emphasizing &#39;anything&#39;. Rei swallowed hard, feeling that same 
feeling all over her body. She knew that Kira wasn&#39;t using any 
supernatural powers, that what she was feeling was just natural 
curiosity. And right then, she couldn&#39;t help the curiosity that 
overwhelmed her at Kira&#39;s statement, the vampire&#39;s fangs showing their 
tips.

&quot;Anything?&quot; She whispered, trying to keep her voice level and getting 
the suspicion that she failed. Kira did her best to not look shocked. 
She had fully been expecting Rei to tell her to shove off. The girl&#39;s 
answer was more than welcome and Kira took a step closer to Rei, 
pressing her body against Rei&#39;s form. Seeing the desire in Rei&#39;s eyes 
she lowered her voice and smiled as seductively as she could, knowing 
that this was not Rei trying to mess with her. 

&quot;Anything.&quot; She promised and felt Rei shudder against her. She watched 
as Rei faltered slightly and ducked her eyes, looking behind her to Ami 
who had completely forgotten her state of undress while watching the 
exchange. Rei looked back at Kira who now had a fair amount of curiosity 
mixed in with her seductive charm. Taking a soothing breath, Rei made 
her choice.

&quot;I want you to bite me.&quot; Kira couldn&#39;t help the shocked look on her 
face at the request. She hadn&#39;t been expecting that at all. Ami gasped 
from behind Rei.

&quot;Rei!&quot; She said in shock and Rei turned to face her.

&quot;I just, I just want to see , Ami-chan. I want to know what&#39;s it&#39;s 
like.What...what it would feel like to be free, to not feel this pain, 
even for a moment. To be happy all the way, deep inside. And...I&#39;m 
curious Ami-chan. Tell me you&#39;re not turned on at all.&quot; Ami flushed a 
deep red and ducked her eyes. &quot;I can&#39;t deny it either Ami-chan. And, I 
wanna know where this feeling can take me. I&#39;m just, curious.&quot; Ami 
looked up and smiled gently at Rei and the raven-haired girl turned to 
face Kira. She regarded Rei carefully and cocked her head to the side.

&quot;Are you sure Rei-chan? I really don&#39;t want to force you into something 
like this. I would never force anyone into something like this.&quot; Rei 
smiled and, hesitantly she nodded and Kira smiled back. Sensing a little 
fear she looked past Rei to see Ami sitting on the very edge of the table 
looking very apprehensive. She smiled down at Rei and gently turned her 
to face Ami.Rei looked up in confusion and Kira gave her a soft smile. 
&quot;It&#39;s okay. I want her to be able to see. So she&#39;ll know I&#39;m not hurting 
you.&quot; Rei nodded again and faced forward. 

Slowly Kira wrapped one arm around Rei&#39;s waist and pulled the girl 
close. She heard Rei breathe in heavily and smiled to herself. Leaning 
down she carefully brushed the hair the flowed down Rei&#39;s back exposing 
a soft, pale neck. Kira let the smile show and sighed. *Oh, this will be 
good* Gently, she placed a small kiss on Rei&#39;s neck and felt the girl 
shiver in her grasp, and the blood pulse beneath her skin. Sighing 
softly she nipped at the skin lightly with her human teeth and looked up 
to meet Ami&#39;s eyes. She was leaning forward, watching the scene before 
her with rapt attention, and short, shallow breaths. Satisfied that Ami 
had a good view, Kira closed her eyes and let her lips dance across 
Rei&#39;s neck, searching for the perfect spot.When she found where the 
blood pulsed the strongest she let her fangs grow out, careful to hide 
them from Ami&#39;s view. Then, tightening her grip on the Priestess, she 
sank her teeth in. 

She heard the small cry from Rei and let the hand that was around her 
gently stroke Rei&#39;s soft stomach. Kira herself sighed softly when Rei&#39;s 
blood hit her tongue. It was just as powerful as she&#39;d thought and the 
sheer volume of emotions swirling through it nearly knocked her 
backwards. Her blood was sweet and pungent and absolutely delicious. She 
forced herself back to the original reason for the bite by reminding 
herself that if it worked this wouldn&#39;t be the only time she&#39;d be able 
to enjoy the taste. Slowly, Kira started to sift through the myriad of 
emotions in Rei&#39;s blood until she found the pain and love that beat so 
strongly in the young girl&#39;s heart. She took particular pride though in 
the strong waves of lust that she kept running into. 

Rei, for her part, nearly fainted when Kira&#39;s teeth broke her skin. But 
then, it felt so, so, good. Being careful to only drink a little Kira 
focused on the pain and strength of the love and pulled it into her body 
through Rei&#39;s blood. She felt Rei whimper softly and tasted her joy at 
the release she felt. Deciding to increase her attack, she increased the 
pressure and speed of her drinking which caused a rush of lust and 
pleasure to shoot through Rei&#39;s veins. Feeling Rei quiver in her arms she 
drank a bit more and allowed her hand to stroke Rei just beneath her 
breasts. The soft, tender skin goose-bumping under her light touch. Rei 
moaned softly and the lust in her blood became overwhelming. Kira was 
sorely tempted to continue knowing full well that Rei wouldn&#39;t attempt 
to stop her but she knew that too much at once could frighten her and 
she really did want to keep Rei and Ami. So she contented herself with 
the knowledge that this had gone very well. Slowly, she returned the 
love and pain but let a generous amount of lust flow with it to soften 
its return. Gently she pulled her fangs from Rei&#39;s neck and licked her 
lips savoring the last remnants of blood.

Pulling in her fangs to return to normal she glanced up at Ami and 
smiled at the look of desire on the blue-haired girl&#39;s face. Making sure 
Ami met her eyes she flicked her tongue out over the wound 
simultaneously using her saliva to heal it quicker, give Rei a last jolt 
of desire, and cause Ami&#39;s blush to deepen. She pulled away from Rei&#39;s 
neck slowly, leaving a few soft kisses on the raven hair. Rei was nearly 
limp in her arms and she carefully moved to the living room and set her 
down on the couch. Rei had a look that was a beautiful mixture of shock, 
disbelief and desire. Her eyes were dark and smoky and Kira sighed. Gods 
she was absolutely beautiful. Kira grinned seductively at the limp 
Priestess and triumphed inside when she saw Rei shiver again.

&quot;You must be tired after that. I&#39;ll go get you something to drink 
okay?&quot;She asked, dropping her voice. Rei nodded, still wide-eyed and 
spaced, andKira turned to Ami who had followed them out. &quot;I&#39;ll bring you 
both some clothes too, all right?&quot; Ami nodded, almost as wide-eyed as 
Rei and Kira couldn&#39;t help but smile as she left the room.

As soon as Kira disappeared from view Ami sat down beside Rei and 
looked at her with slight concern. The girl in her, especially the parts 
that had been in love with Makoto for so long, wanted to ask how it was, 
to ask if it worked. But the doctor in her took over and she needed to 
know Rei was okay. A quick glance told her that the wounds on Rei&#39;s neck 
were already healing quickly. Carefully she placed a hand on Rei&#39;s knee.

&quot;Rei-chan? Rei-chan?&quot; She urged gently, lightly shaking Rei&#39;s knee. 
&quot;Rei-chan are you okay?&quot; Rei opened her eyes lazily, Ami&#39;s face swimming 
into focus. She offered a slow smile and nodded.

&quot;Yeah Ami-chan. I&#39;m... I&#39;m good.&quot; Rei settled back into the cushions 
letting her body come to terms with all of the feelings flooding her. 
The feeling of Kira touching her lightly, the pain of her fangs breaking 
the skin, the extascy and the release that she&#39;d felt when Kira had 
released her bond to Usagi and Minako. The pleasure that was still 
pumping through her veins. She could very clearly feel Ami&#39;s hand on her 
leg and was just as aware that they were both still naked. Opening her 
eyes again she saw Ami still looking at her with concern, and after 
giving the girl&#39;s body a subtle once over Rei sighed. 

&quot;Are you sure Rei-chan? You&#39;re not hurt?&quot; Rei shook her head again and 
sat up straighter.

&quot;It hurt right when she bit me. But then...it felt...I felt...&quot; Rei 
trailed off, a dreamy look coming to her eyes and Ami shuddered. She 
knew exactly how Rei had felt. The pleasure on her face while she was 
being bitten was testament enough. Just bringing up the image in her 
head Ami quivered, desire shooting through her again. Suddenly she was 
very aware of their current state of dress, and just how close to Rei 
she was.

&quot;I know how you felt Rei-chan.&quot; She whispered softly and Rei met her 
eyes, shivering at the look in them. A look she knew was in her own 
eyes.

&quot;It was absolutely incredible Ami-chan. It felt so good. So...free. And 
then, then when Kira-san took my bond to Usagi-chan and Minako-chan 
away, I felt so...incredible. If she hadn&#39;t of stopped, I probably 
would&#39;ve...well, you know.&quot; She left off in a blush and Ami flushed too, 
smiling and ducking her eyes from Rei&#39;s. Quiet laughter interrupted 
their embarrassment and they turned to watch Kira enter the room, two 
fluffy robes draped over her arm.

&quot;Yes, that is one of the more pleasant side affects.&quot; She said with a 
quirky smile, holding out a robe to each girl. Ami slid hers on slowly, 
not at all affected by the fact that Kira was seeing her naked. 
*Somehow, it doesn&#39;t bother me that Rei and I are here naked together, 
with Kira watching. It actually feels, good to be this free.* She 
watched as Rei slipped hers over her shoulders but left the front open, 
not bothering to close it. *Rei is acting different too. I guess we both 
wanted to do something different. A vacation from ourselves.* She 
watched with a smile as Kira teased Rei about feeling so good and Rei 
simply stuck out her tongue. Kira waggled her eyebrows at the gesture 
and Rei just rolled her eyes. * I want to feel that. To feel that 
comfortable, that pleasure...* Making up her mind quickly, Ami faced Kira 
who was handing Rei a glass of juice.

&quot;Are you sure a bite won&#39;t turn us?&quot; She asked and Kira regarded the 
shy girl with a smile.

&quot;Not unless I want it too. And I wasn&#39;t particularly interested in 
making you two like me. Why do you ask?&quot; Kira asked carefully, seeing 
the thoughtful expression on Ami&#39;s face. Rei&#39;s request to be bitten had 
taken her completely off guard though she was thrilled that Rei had let 
her. Now, seeing the contemplative look on Ami&#39;s face, she set herself to 
hear anything.

&quot;I...I want to...I want you to...&quot; Ami sighed and took a deep breath, 
setting her shoulders. Looking at Kira with determination she smiled. &quot;I 
want you to bite me too.&quot; Kira almost allowed her jaw to drop. *So, I 
wasn&#39;t prepared for everything. * Rei&#39;s jaw had dropped and she stared 
at Ami.

&quot;Are you serious Ami-chan?&quot; She asked incredulously. Ami just smiled at 
her.

&quot;I want to feel what you felt Rei-chan. I was watching you while she 
was biting you. And, aside from the...pleasure, you looked so peaceful, 
so happy. I want to feel that too. Just this once.&quot; Turning she looked 
at Kira who was watching her curiously. &quot;Please Kira-san. I want to try 
too.&quot; Kira smiled gently at Ami. She could feel the desire coursing 
through the young girl, it was coming off of her in waves. Ami had been 
much more reserved than Rei had back with the others. And she had loved 
Makoto much more and for longer than Rei had loved the others.* She 
probably needs this even more.*

&quot;Are you sure Ami-chan?&quot; Nodding firmly Ami forced a calming breath 
into her lungs. Kira stared at her a moment longer then nodded. Inwardly 
she couldn&#39;t believe her luck. That both of them would willingly give 
themselves to her like this... Stepping closer she slowly wrapped her 
arms around Ami and pulled her up close. Ami tilted her head to the side 
exposing her neck to Kira. Kira held her tight and bent her head down, 
gently kissing the tender skin. Ami shivered against her and, sensing 
that Ami really did need release, Kira kissed slowly across her neck, 
lightly scrapping her teeth against Ami&#39;s earlobe. Ami moaned softly and 
pressed herself against Kira. Kissing back down the curve of her 
collarbone, Kira alternated kissing and playfully licking Ami&#39;s soft 
skin, enjoying her honest reactions. 

Her quiet gasps and gentle whimpers were really starting to get to Rei 
who was still on the couch. Curiosity getting the better of her she slid 
off the couch and circled the pair slowly. Kira watched her curiously, 
still nipping Ami&#39;s skin lightly. Rei stopped when she could see Ami&#39;s 
face and watched her in awe. Every time she would gasp her face would 
twist and Rei could see the pleasure on her face. It was making her 
throb a little and she shifted, trying to ease the tension. Kira could 
very clearly sense Rei&#39;s desire as well as Ami&#39;s. Feeling a little 
overwhelmed she tightened her grip on Ami even more and let her fangs 
grow out. Then, hearing Ami&#39;s sharp intake of breath, let her teeth 
break the skin. Ami cried out softly then groaned as Kira started to 
drink. Rei watched with quickened breath. She knew exactly what it was 
that Ami was feeling, the pleasure, the desire. And she pinpointed the 
exact moment when Kira separated Ami from her bond to Makoto.The look of 
absolute joy on Ami&#39;s face followed quickly by another soft whimper as 
Kira increased the lust in Ami&#39;s blood just as she had done with Rei 
sent the Priestess over the edge and before she knew what she was doing 
she pressed in against Kira and touched Ami&#39;s lips with her own. 

Kira nearly started when Rei had pushed against her and the resulting 
explosion of desire in Ami&#39;s blood made Kira&#39;s knees weak. Ami moaned 
into Rei, unable to deny the want that flowed through her. She kissed 
Rei back gently, barely moving her lips against Rei&#39;s as Kira&#39;s bite was 
quickly draining her of strength. At the same time it was all swirling 
inside of her, going round and round, tighter and tighter, closing in on 
the almost painful throbbing between her legs. Rei let her tongue lash 
out against Ami&#39;s lips and pushed herself against Kira to get closer to 
Ami. Kira almost whimpered herself. It had been so long since she&#39;d been 
with anyone, since it had been like this. The heat of Rei against her 
back, of Ami pressed to her front, the desire flooding the blood that 
washed over her tongue. She could feel how close Ami was, the impending 
release teasing her as much as it was teasing Ami. Unable to resist she 
tilted her head forward and drank deeply from Ami, knowing that it would 
push her over the edge. And it did, much to Ami&#39;s surprise. She hadn&#39;t 
known what it was that was throbbing, hadn&#39;t known what it was that her 
body had wanted, hadn&#39;t known just how much Rei&#39;s kiss and Kira&#39;s bite 
were affecting her. Her body stiffened against Kira and she broke her 
kiss with Rei as she threw her head back, crying out as the orgasm raced 
through her blood like lightening. Sparking against all of her nerves at 
once and exploding into her center. 

Kira held her close until her shivering stopped and only then pulled 
her fangs from Ami&#39;s neck after returning Ami&#39;s bond to the lightning 
senshi. Rei watched Ami&#39;s face in fascination as the pleasure slowly 
drained from her face leaving the ice senshi with a soft, pleased smile 
on her face. Moving forward Kira gently laid Ami down on the sofa and 
pulled back. She started when she saw the glowing blue sigil coming from 
Ami&#39;s forehead.

&quot;What in the world?&quot; She asked, lightly running her fingers over the 
warm light. Ami just opened her eyes and blushed. Rei knelt beside the 
couch and smiled.

&quot;Yeah, that happens to me to when I, well...&quot; She trailed off and Kira 
just grinned at her, still focused on Ami. &quot;It probably happens to all 
of the other senshi too.&quot; Kira shook her head in confusion.

&quot;But when I was with Setsuna-san... I mean, it never happened with 
her.&quot;Thinking back Kira was sure she would&#39;ve remembered Setsuna 
glowing, no matter how out of it she usually was after she and Setsuna 
had gotten to that point.

&quot;She probably knows how to hide it.&quot; Kira looked at Rei curiously and 
Ami answered with a smile.

&quot;She is the oldest and most controlled of all the senshi. Even then she 
was the strongest. It might not be that hard for her to hide her power.&quot; 
Kira was about to respond when a harsh laugh sounded behind them. Kira 
spun in place instantly putting herself in front of Rei and Ami, shocked 
that she hadn&#39;t sensed a presence. Akio stood there, his arms crossed, 
glaring at her despite his laugh. Kira growled, tensing up as he 
smirked.

&quot;A senshi huh?&quot; He said, snickering to himself. &quot;No wonder you never 
forgot her.&quot;</pre>
