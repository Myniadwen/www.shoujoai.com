----------------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru hummed to herself, playing with her whittling knife and the 
piece of wood in her hand.  She was making a new instrument to imitate 
the siren call of the sea and call for her soulmate.  She didn&#39;t know if 
it would work, but she knew that something must.  She was so very 
lonely.
 
Michiru, Princess of Kaiousei, wandered over to her window and looked 
out at the city she would one day rule.  Just below the castle, hidden 
from all but the tallest towers in the palace by an outcropping of 
blue-white rocks, a tall man appeared, something in his hand and a sword 
on his hip.  He seemed surprised to be on Triton, and he faded into the 
shadows before Michiru could identify him.  Shrugging, Michiru returned 
to her instrument, taking the bow in her hand.  Drawing it across the 
strings, the young princess sighed at the soft, clear notes that filled 
her room.  She composed a short, mournful melody, letting the song 
spread through the castle, out the window she left open to admit the sea 
breeze, and into the town, calling.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka looked up, entranced by the music coming from the castle.  It was 
obviously a stringed instrument, as was the one she created, but it 
sounded like the sound was created by a bow rather than hammers on 
strings.  She had never heard anything so beautiful.  Unknowingly, the 
young Senshi turned her steps toward the palace, seeking the owner of 
the instrument.
 
The music stopped abruptly, and Haruka cried out in regret.  Sighing, 
depressed by the loss of the melody, Haruka wandered back into the heart 
of the city.
 
She heard a series of angry shouts and followed the sound to its source.  
The warrior stumbled upon a group of peasant men circling a young woman 
in a long blue robe, demanding money and reaching out to touch her.  
Incensed, Haruka drew the Space Sword.
 
&quot;Leave her alone,&quot; she growled, startling the group.  The leader 
chuckled and drew his own sword&#151;obviously stolen from someone else.
 
&quot;Walk away now and no one will get hurt,&quot; the man growled, his voice 
roughened by a life on the streets.
 
&quot;You will leave her alone or you will lose the hand you so eagerly touch 
her with.&quot;
 
The gang leader moved first, but Haruka was far faster than the commoner 
and had seen him shift his weight in preparation for the attack.  She 
swung, barely cutting his arm, and he dropped the sword.  &quot;Leave,&quot; she 
repeated.
 
The gang members had not planned on an opponent who could fight better 
than their leader, and they were quick to vacate the area.  Haruka 
watched as her sword absorbed the tiny spot of blood then she sheathed 
it and turned to the woman.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;
 
The woman removed her hood, and Haruka started at the intensity of her 
deep blue eyes.  &quot;Princess Kaiou Michiru,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Why are you 
out of the palace without an escort?&quot;
 
&quot;I was looking for you,&quot; she replied, her soft voice light with 
restrained humor.  The attack had not dampened her spirits, and she was 
happy to find the traveler.
 
&quot;Why?&quot;
 
&quot;I saw you appear while I was finishing my instrument.  I don&#39;t think 
anyone else in the palace noticed your sudden appearance.&quot;
 
&quot;Instrument?  That was your music I heard?  It stopped before I reached 
the source.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled; her wish had come true.  If this man had been drawn to 
her song then he must be her soulmate.  The princess bowed to the blonde 
man, smiling at the surprise on his face.  &quot;Thank you, good sir, for 
coming to my aid.  It was kind of you.&quot;
 
&quot;I did what anyone would have done,&quot; Haruka replied, uncomfortable now 
that the danger had passed.
 
&quot;It was kind of you,&quot; Michiru repeated.  &quot;I do not believe that I know 
your name.&quot;
 
&quot;Urakaze Haruka,&quot; the Senshi introduced, assuming the mantle of the 
duke&#39;s son again.  It had worked rather well with the princesses of 
Kasei, Kinsei, Mokusei, and Suisei; only the Moon Princess had seen 
through the deception.
 
&quot;Haruka-kun, would you like to visit my castle and meet my mother?  I&#39;m 
sure she will gladly receive you in thanks for rescuing me.&quot;
 
&quot;I would like that, yes, princess.&quot;
 
&quot;Call me Michiru, Haruka-kun.  Come, let us go.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka slipped up the stairs, silently, hidden in the shadows, following 
the music.  The princess of Kaiousei was playing her instrument, calling 
with her heart, and Haruka felt a touch of destiny when she heard it.  
She looked into the room and her heart turned over at the sight of the 
slender princess sitting on her window seat, playing, eyes closed. 
 
&quot;Come in, Haruka-kun.&quot;  The Uranian princess jumped at the invitation, 
shocked that the Neptunian princess had sensed her presence.  &quot;You&#39;ll 
find that there is little you can hide from the princess destined to 
wield the Aqua Mirror.  Come in, my friend.&quot;
 
Haruka entered the room warily, taking the seat that Michiru indicated.  
&quot;I heard your song, and it seemed to be calling me.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  You were drawn to it days ago when we first met.  You needn&#39;t 
hide from me.&quot;
 
Haruka touched Michiru&#39;s arm and smiled.  &quot;It&#39;s very beautiful; I 
imagine many people are called by your melody.&quot;
 
&quot;Only you, Haruka-kun, as it should be.  Would you like to go on an 
outing with me in the morning?&quot;  Michiru lowered her instrument and 
looked at the taller Senshi, one slim eyebrow raised in a question.
 
&quot;S-sure.  Michiru-san, why are you being so kind to me?  I have nothing 
to offer and you aren&#39;t likely to require my services again.&quot;
 
&quot;I have my reasons, Urakaze Haruka.  I don&#39;t know what you mean, that 
you don&#39;t have anything to teach me; Minako-chan sent me a communication 
earlier this week telling me about you and your visit to Rei-chan&#39;s 
castle.  Apparently, you also visited Ami-chan and Mako-chan at Io 
Castle.  You taught them fighting skills and &#145;lessons on life&#39;, 
apparently.&quot;
 
&quot;I am finished with that, princess.  I have nothing left to teach.&quot;
 
&quot;What did you learn on the Moon that so disillusioned you?&quot;
 
Haruka looked up sharply.  &quot;You know about the moon?  How?&quot;
 
&quot;Your &#145;koneko-chan&#39; also called me.&quot;
 
Haruka smiled at the nickname she had given the young princess.  &quot;She 
needed a little help with her confidence, but the queen stubbornly 
refuses to train young Serenity in the art of combat.  I fear for her 
life, Michiru-san.&quot;
 
Michiru placed a small, warm hand on Haruka&#39;s arm and smiled at the 
taller fighter.  &quot;I do not believe that you have nothing left to teach.  
Haruka-kun, you must have a reason for your journey, and I know that you 
are still searching for something.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t think I remember what that is.&quot;
 
&quot;Then I will help you rediscover your purpose.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka watched Michiru eat, amazed at her manners.  Even as a princess 
of Ten&#39;ousei, Haruka had never been expected to be polite at the table.  
Her father never seemed to see her.  But Princess Michiru took small 
bites, ate with delicate care, and seemed to fear even the slightest 
breach of protocol.  Her white gloves resembled those worn by Sailor 
Jupiter, and Haruka knew that she yearned for her Sailor Senshi duties.  
Haruka found herself slowing down and being more careful with her food 
as she watched Michiru eat.
 
&quot;Where do you come from, Haruka-kun?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m a member of the Kingdom of Ten&#39;ousei and the only child of a 
powerful man.  My mother died birthing me, and I still sometimes hear 
her voice calling to me on the winds.  What about you, Michiru-san?&quot;
 
&quot;My father died in a battle of some sort when I was a tiny baby, and I m 
told that Meiou Setsuna lost her brothers and mother in the same 
conflict.  My mother has always been sad and she visits Uranus a lot, 
though I don&#39;t know why.  She has been Sailor Neptune for a very long 
time, but the Aqua Mirror no longer responds to her power.  She has 
taken that to mean that I am to become Sailor Neptune, and she plans to 
pass the henshin stick to me on my birthday, which is coming quickly.  
She also searches desperately for a duke or the son of a duke for me to 
wed by my birthday, though I have rejected them all.&quot;
 
&quot;Where is she now?  I should have met her, as long as I&#39;ve been in the 
castle.&quot;
 
&quot;She is on Miranda, as far as I can tell.  She left while I was in the 
city looking for you.&quot;

Haruka nodded, knowing why Kaiou Shousha was visiting her kingdom.  She 
went to see Ten&#39;ou Kazeko&#39;s grave.  Michiru, who was sitting very close 
to Haruka, suddenly leaned over and rested her head on the taller 
woman&#39;s shoulder.  She closed her eyes, enjoying the feeling of destiny 
that washed over her, and her mind took her to dreams of her wedding 
with the wielder of the sword that had saved her life.  Haruka wrapped 
her arm around the princess&#39;s waist and let her sleep.</pre>
