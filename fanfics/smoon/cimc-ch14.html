<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 14 of 15)</h1>

<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;I can&#39;t carry this,&quot; Rei muttered, trying to hulk the massive 
broadsword over her shoulder. &quot;It&#39;s heavy. Anything else?&quot; 

Mitsuki sat on the edge of Kazuki&#39;s desk, playing with an elaborately 
decorated dagger. &quot;Umm. Maybe.&quot; She reached for a wooden staff with gold 
and red markings, tested its weight. &quot;Try this.&quot; Rei grasped the weapon, 
spun it around in her hands, and gasped when the bottom detached, 
revealing a dangerous-looking blade. She grinned. &quot;Wow...&quot; 

Mitsuki rolled her eyes. &quot;Press a bottom at the top, and it&#39;ll detract 
to fit into your pocket. Remove the bottom, and you&#39;ll find the blade. 
Be careful with that too. I mean, if we see Kazuki again, and she finds 
out we&#39;ve been playing around in her shop...&quot; She shuddered at the 
thought. Kazuki was frightening enough already, and that was before she 
knew she was a vampire. Rei shrugged her shoulders. 

&quot;She&#39;ll live,&quot; she walked toward the door, motioned for Mitsuki to 
follow her. &quot;Come on.&quot; 

&quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to be on vacation? And where do we start?&quot; 

&quot;Apparently one of the girls wasn&#39;t careful enough. Seems there was 
another mysterious murder in the district near us.&quot; Mitsuki groaned. 

&quot;I&#39;m not a detective. Why do I have to go?&quot; 

&quot;Because your boss requested it. Now quit whining and let&#39;s go.&quot; 

------------------------------ 

&quot;Terrific,&quot; Mia grinned, played with the daggers in her hand. &quot;Enchant.&quot; 
The weapons disappeared. &quot;They still work. My. Our quarry has become 
messy. Not bothering to cover their tracks, I see.&quot; 

Celeste shrugged her shoulders, grazed her fingers across the edge of 
her sword. &quot;Stupid. They think that their numbers make them immune.&quot; She 
heard a click and a few beeps, and gazed over at Mia, who held a gun 
lazily between tapered fingers. 

&quot;Too bad,&quot; the dark-skinned girl drawled. &quot;Because we have new toys. We 
have a legacy to uphold, and all that. Our families have been fighting 
those things for years. Maybe, when we finally get rid of all those 
things, we can take up a nice vacation.&quot; She rolled her eyes. &quot;When is 
the last time one of us had a vacation anyway?&quot; 

&quot;My father thinks this counts as a vacation,&quot; Celeste muttered in 
aggravation. 

&quot;Ha ha,&quot; Mia remarked dryly, setting the gun down. 

------------------------------ 

Minako sat in quiet, cold rooms and sulked and moped as was customary. 
She was silly, telling that funny little doctor she loved that girl with 
her white hair and her strange, deep green eyes. She didn&#39;t love; she 
fixated, something maddening and strange within the confines of her 
mind. She thought though, that she might be able to love someone like 
that, someone that fussed over her wounds and played with big dogs and 
made soft, purring noises in their sleep. She wondered what it would be 
like to wake up next to a woman like that, hair tousled with sleep, and 
eyes warm with love and desire. Minako felt something warm in the pit of 
her stomach and frowned. 

So she didn&#39;t love, she didn&#39;t infatuate, so perhaps she had a crush. It 
seemed fairly immature to call it that(what, with her age), but that&#39;s 
what it was, all butterflies and glitter. Something new, that warmed the 
ache in her dead heart. 

She heard the click of boots and glanced in the direction of her door. 
She knew that sound, knew that they belonged to either the calm Setsuna, 
or her pompous, impetous mate. 

&quot;What are you in there doing? Moping?&quot; A slow, lazy drawl. Pompous mate 
it was. 

&quot;Go away,&quot; she muttered miserably, playing with strands of loose, 
wayward hair. 

&quot;Just wanted to tell you something, but I guess I could go away and all. 
And it was something terribly important. Well, I&#39;ll be leaving now,&quot; she 
heard the turn of a heel and boots clicking further away. 

&quot;Wait a second! What do you want to tell me?&quot; She could almost feel the 
smirk, even though she couldn&#39;t see it. 

&quot;Well, we&#39;re having guests.&quot; Minako rolled her eyes. Guests indeed. Male 
vampires that leered and pawed and begged for mates. She wondered why 
they didn&#39;t just turn to each other, if they were so desperate. After a 
moment, she decided that they probably did. She was about to tell Kazuki 
to leave again, but the next words through the door stopped her. 

&quot;Two guests. Well...four, if you count the little hunters. The 
detective, and a young woman that worked for me once. Maybe you know 
her? She has white hair; isn&#39;t that strange?&quot; Kazuki&#39;s tone was light 
and almost too airy, and Minako wondered if the woman was telepathic. 

&quot;White hair?&quot; Minako was mortified when her voice came out as a 
surprised squeak. Kazuki had the good grace not to chuckle at her 
expense. 

&quot;White hair. And green eyes. Have you met her?&quot; When she received no 
answer, she continued nonetheless. &quot;Well, she&#39;s coming with that silly, 
nosy detective. I don&#39;t really know what she thinks she&#39;s going to 
achieve...but you might want to keep an eye out, you know? Wouldn&#39;t want 
one of Demando&#39;s boys to get to her. A pretty little thing like that? 
They&#39;d just ravage her.&quot; 

&quot;How do you know everything&quot; Minako cried exasperatedly. Kazuki chuckled 
this time. 

&quot;My, well, I don&#39;t know a thing. Setsuna tells me all of this. And 
you&#39;re welcome.&quot; She heard the click of boots fading, and then nothing. 

&quot;Thank you, you annoying snob...&quot; she whispered in the dark. 

------------------------------ 

&quot;You&#39;re serious?&quot; 

&quot;I speak the truth, Milady. My only wish is to make you happy, just like 
everyone else. The detective will arrive in a few days, along with 
another young woman.&quot; Setsuna&#39;s voice was calm and controlled, but her 
queen buzzed with energy, zipping this way and that in the large room. 

&quot;Oh, oh, Setsuna. I&#39;m so very afraid. What will happen to her if Demando 
finds out? What then?&quot; Setsuna shuffled from side to side, her voice 
lowered to a whisper. 

&quot;Milady. Do you remember the jewel that Demando took from you a long 
time ago?&quot; Serenity looked up. 

&quot;My crystal?&quot; 

&quot;That is correct. And did you ever find out what that crystal did?&quot; 

&quot;Well...no. I lost it, and...left Demando before I could discover its 
purpose.&quot; 

&quot;It has the power to grant a single wish, Milady. And since it was a 
gift to you from Demando, it is your wish to grant. You get the crystal 
from Demando, and if something terrible is to happen, you can wish on it 
and bring things back to normal.&quot; 

&quot;Oh...I...&quot; Serenity sat on her bed. &quot;Any wish?&quot; 

&quot;Any wish. And Milady, in a few days, Demando is to have a party in your 
honor. In a few days, the hunters will crash it. And in a few days, you 
will have to grant your wish. Choose wisely, my queen.&quot; 

&quot;The hunters...they&#39;re still alive?&quot; 

&quot;The Mother Repiamseu and Father Videame? Dead. But their descendants 
are very much alive, and that family will not rest until we are all 
exterminated.&quot; 

&quot;Dear Lord...that dreadful man and that horrible woman...And to train 
their children in such a despicable art...&quot; 

&quot;Not really despicable, just sad. It&#39;s the way it is, Milady.&quot; 

&quot;But still...&quot; Serenity sighed. &quot;Never mind. I suppose we&#39;ll just have 
to wait.&quot; 

&quot;Are you nervous?&quot; Setsuna asked. 

&quot;Most certainly.&quot; Serenity replied. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you be?&quot; 

Setsuna smiled. &quot;I suppose I would.&quot;
