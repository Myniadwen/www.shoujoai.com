*************

Usagi fell to her knees in the park, wrapping her arms around herself as 
bitter tears coursed down her cheeks. Despair, guilt, depression, 
confusion, love, longing; emotions filled her like never before, making 
her shake, and not from the chilly night. What now? Minako was gone and 
Mamoru was mad at her.

She wanted to love Mamoru, wanted to feel that boundless love for him 
again. But when she tried to think of him, of the things they had 
survived because of love, her mind always drifted to Sailor Venus. She 
remembered the fight against the Black Moon, how Sailor Venus had been 
the only one who stayed by her side. When the other senshi had been 
abducted, when Mamoru lavished Rini with all of his attention, when he 
left her yet again, it was Minako&#39;s shoulder she had cried on. It was 
Minako who had stayed by her side and never left her, never forsaken 
her.

How many times had she played the Sailor V game, not knowing that the 
golden senshi was on the other end training her, being with her, sharing 
her laughs, deaths, and disappointments. She had been hooked to the game 
not only because of the fun, but because she had been drawn to Sailor V, 
longed to be with her, even if she had not realized it at the time. How 
many times had she run to the game for comfort when the real senshi was 
not there?

When Zoicite had been about to kill her it had been Minako who had 
destroyed him. When the Dark Kingdom had taken Mamoru it was Minako who 
had kneeled by her side and comforted her. It had been Minako who she 
followed to the Dark Kingdom; Minako whose name she called out when she 
had seen her lying, still as death, at Mamoru&#39;s feet. It was Minako who 
destroyed Beryl with the sword of the Sailor Senshi. It was Minako who 
had first sacrificed her transformation pen to revive her princess.

How many times had the senshi protected her, laid her life on the line 
to make sure Usagi was safe? When a youma had attacked her, stolen her 
life force, it was Minako&#39;s face she woke to see. When Mamoru dumped 
her, how many times had she gone to Minako&#39;s house to cry, and ended up 
lying in the girl&#39;s arms and clinging to her as the goddess stroked her 
hair and whispered comforting words in her ears.

Now Usagi&#39;s tears were for Minako. Where was the goddess now? Why did 
she leave? She wanted her back, wanted to see her bright smile again, to 
hear her honey-sweet laugher on the air, to be in her arms and cry onto 
her shoulder, to hear her soft voice giving her comfort, giving her 
strength, giving her courage. &quot;Minako...come back to me...please...&quot;

A gust of hot air washed over Usagi&#39;s trembling body. She lifted her 
face, squinting as a burst of golden sand blew around her in a sandstorm 
like she had only seen all those years ago when she had visited Venus. 
Usagi rubbed her eyes and peered through the sand, searching for what 
had caused the sudden storm. A flash of golden light shined through the 
sandstorm, piecing Usagi&#39;s eyes and blinding her with its brilliance.

Her breath came in gasps, aw filling her to the core. A silhouette 
emerged from the light, the wind and sand blowing the elegant dress she 
wore about her feminine form, long hair blowing about her shoulders. The 
woman lifted her arms, and the storm quieted; the sand disappeared. She 
looked toward Usagi, her skin glowing with power and stunning beauty, 
and a heavenly smile curled her generous lips. *The Goddess of Love* was 
all Usagi could think. Aphrodite had come.

New tears slipped down her cheeks, but she could not tear her eyes off 
the glowing goddess stepping toward her. Usagi trembled with fear, 
shrinking away and trying in vain to stop her tears. But she could not; 
she had really screwed up if the Goddess of Love herself had come. The 
goddess placed a hand on her hip, the other brushing back her hair. The 
blinding light dimmed and Usagi squinted at the woman standing before 
her, looking closer.

Her eyes widened and a smile slowly lit her face. A desperate cry of joy 
escaped her lips and Usagi reached out her slender arms to the girl, joy 
bubbling inside her and chasing away the pain, the confusion, and the 
sorrow. It was not Aphrodite who had come to punish her, but another 
goddess who had come to comfort her.

A joyous laugh flew from Minako&#39;s lips as she ran to Usagi, falling into 
the girl&#39;s arms. She squeezed her azure eyes tightly shut and let Usagi 
draw her close, slipping her arms around the princess&#39;s waist and 
letting her hands caress her back. She breathed a silent prayer, 
thanking every known deity for this gift, this beloved angel in her 
arms. Usagi pressed her face into Minako&#39;s breast, clinging to the 
golden senshi as if clinging to her sanity, clinging to the very essence 
of life itself.

She heaved a deep, slow sigh; felt the tension wash out of her body and 
leave only the raw, bare emotions of her heart. She had come back; 
Minako had come back to her. It didn&#39;t matter why she left or what had 
brought her back. All that mattered was that she was there and she was 
holding her. The goddess smelt of sulfur, sand, and the subtle, exotic 
fragrance of sex. Usagi couldn&#39;t help but smile at that; the air on 
Venus had always had a subtle aroma of sex in it, one that had always 
aroused the princess, indeed all who did not live there. She felt so 
peaceful, kneeling in the park in the arms of her goddess, her Minako. 
&quot;You came back.&quot; Her words were a soft whisper, as if the princess was 
afraid of breaking the silence, afraid of breaking the perfection of the 
moment with words.

Minako placed her hand on the back of Usagi&#39;s head, cradling her in her 
arms and resting her chin atop her hair. &quot;Of course I did, Usa. I can 
never leave you. I am Sailor Venus.&quot; Usagi sniffed, but did not respond. 
The Venusian knew what questions her princess was burning to ask, but 
she wasn&#39;t sure if she was ready to tell her the truth. Wasn&#39;t sure if 
she was ready to end the pain that had been so much a part of her life 
for so long, as absurd as it sounded. There was a certain security in 
the constant ache, a certain balance.

She opened her eyes and gazed down at the princess, at her pale skin and 
bright hair, dyed silver by the moonlight. And she felt her heart melt, 
and her lips tingle with a primitive lustful hunger she had never had 
the chance to feel before. Her soul mate, this elegant, warm-hearted, 
generous goddess of a princess was her soul mate. The love-starved 
senshi could hardly believe it, would not have believed it if Aphrodite 
had not told her.

Usagi tilted her face up and her sapphire eyes met Minako&#39;s. They burned 
with emotion, with questions, with confusion, and Minako knew that she 
could not turn this girl away. She could not hide her heart from her any 
longer. A resigned sigh escaped her lips, and Minako smiled, ever so 
faintly, as she placed a delicate hand on Usagi&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Usa, I know what you want to ask. Your eyes are burning with questions. 
I just...don&#39;t know if I can answer them. I don&#39;t know I can bare my 
heart so completely, so quickly.&quot; Usagi frowned and opened her mouth to 
speak, but Minako shook her head and placed a finger on the princess&#39;s 
lips. Gently, she pried the girl&#39;s arms off of her and gracefully rose 
to her feet.

She turned away as she spoke and gazed up at the moon, folding her hands 
over her heart. &quot;But, I suppose that I have been waiting my whole life 
for this moment. You deserve to know, and no matter what your decision 
may be-&quot; her voice broke, but she swallowed her fear and continued. 
&quot;Whatever your decision, I will follow your orders and do as I am bid.&quot;

She turned back to Usagi, her expression sad once more. Usagi dared not 
move, dared not speak, for fear of what the goddess might say. But she 
had to know, had to know if what was happing was in any way connected to 
destiny. If the feelings raging in her body were returned at all. And so 
she kept silent, hardly daring to breathe, and smiled encouragingly at 
the struggling senshi.

Minako seemed to take heart from Usagi&#39;s smile and smiled back. &quot;I ran 
away because I was afraid. Afraid of my heart, afraid of loosing control 
over a love that I have reined in for so long. I ran, but I did not know 
where to run. So I followed my heart and escaped to the one place that I 
knew would always welcome me, would always be another home. I ran to 
Venus, and there I discovered my destiny.&quot;

She paused, considering her next words. So much rode on the words she 
chose, on the way she presented her heart to her princess. Her very life 
lay on the line. &quot;I love. Truly, deeply, and completely. The whole of my 
being cries for this love, but never can I have it. And so I walk at 
night, trying to escape the torment of my own thoughts. Usagi...I always 
ended up near you. Wherever you were, I would find myself standing just 
a few yards away. And always I would think of you, and dream of you, and 
wonder if you ever thought of me.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s breath didn&#39;t seem like it wanted to come. Her heart pounded, 
ached. God, she wanted this so much. Please, God, let this be real; let 
the senshi be saying what she thought she was saying. &quot;Last night it 
became to much for me. I confessed in the only safe way I knew how, and 
then I ran. I was afraid of what you would say. I was afraid of getting 
my heart broken again. But now I know...one cannot hide love in shame. 
Love is too boundless an emotion to be concealed and contained in 
shadows.&quot;

Minako kneeled in front of Usagi and took both of her hands in hers, 
gazing deep into the princess&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Usagi. I&#39;m sorry for 
all of this pain and confusion...I&#39;m sorry for my weak heart and foolish 
feelings.&quot; She looked away from the princess&#39;s eyes. It was too hard to 
look at her. &quot;I-I&#39;ve fallen in love with you, Princess Serenity. I love 
you more than words can ever express.&quot; The goddess&#39;s voice faded to a 
pained whisper, her body shaking with fear. &quot;I love....&quot;

Black clouds seemed to cover the goddess&#39;s azure orbs, so filed with 
pain and longing, as poison filled her heart. Wanting so much what she 
had known was unreachable for so long. The words flew from her heart by 
inescapable pain; desperation and love mingling to form a beast that had 
tore the words from her throat. Knowledge did little to ease her fears, 
only raised them. Fear that the knowledge she possessed was not that 
which she thought it was.

But as the goddess trembled under the weight of anguish, the princess 
felt a warmth bud in her bosom, a flower unfurling in the golden 
sunshine of what she had not known she wanted. Numbness of mind, wide 
eyes that stared at the goddess&#39;s averted face with incomprehension, 
allowed the warmth to spread through her limbs, filling each corner of 
her shadowed body with light and love.

And the sun emerged from the clouds, and Usagi knew her mind and heart 
alike. The golden senshi shrunk away from her silence, into the shadows, 
but the princess reached for her and cupped her face in her hands. A 
smile graced her lips, her crystal eyes alight with new discovery, and 
her hands slid down the goddess&#39;s neck, over her shoulders, feeling the 
creamy skin under her palm with new a heart. She spoke not a word, for 
words failed to convey the emotions that swirled within her. She merely 
pressed her forehead against the goddess&#39;s and breathed a sigh of such 
contentment words need not be spoken.

Clouds parted once more in the goddess&#39;s eyes and poison turned to 
crimson water in her veins. The princess&#39;s smile spread throughout 
Minako&#39;s being and cleansed her as the princess&#39;s tentative hands 
soothed her. Her breath shuddered from her breast and she swallowed back 
her tears. Pain was no more, forbidden need was now satisfied, and her 
own smile lit her face as she slid her arms around the princess&#39;s waist 
and held her close.

&quot;Mina, darling...you cannot imagine how happy you have made me. I had 
not known my own love, until I saw you tonight. Until I felt your arms 
around me, and felt complete as never before. I love you dearly, my 
Minako. I love you as none before.&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice faded, and they knew 
that no words need be spoken again. No other soul in this world 
mattered, but the feel of the girl in her arms, the warmth of her breath 
on her cheek. Minako clutched the princess close to her, closing her 
eyes tight and pressing her lips into her hair.

She smiled into the princess&#39;s eyes, cupping her cheek in her palm. The 
loving smile gracing the girl&#39;s countenance, the sparkle in her eyes, 
healed her soul, and the goddess brushed her lips across the princess&#39;s, 
her eyes never closing. Usagi reached forward, and as she brought her 
lips to meet Minako&#39;s she searched the azure depths of the goddess&#39;s 
soul and clung to her silken robes, letting herself drown.

Like satin, like heaven, like moonlight embracing sunlight. The goddess 
sighed into the princess&#39;s mouth and held her hands as bliss became 
passion. Her heart bled still, but never more would it bleed in pain. 
Forever shall it bleed with the healing wound of true love, as the 
princess would always be at her side and in her soul. And the colors of 
hopeful dawn painted the sky above them in a testament to their passion.
