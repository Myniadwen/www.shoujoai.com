Return of the Starlights; a Crystal Transformation 

&#147;Somebody help us!!!!&#148; Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter shouted. Then 
something broke the vines and released the four inner senshi and sound 
of snapping fingers could be heard just when Sailor Mars ran in out of 
breath. &#147;Who&#146;s there!?&#148; the monster demanded. 

&#147;Cutting through the darkness of night&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Running through an atmosphere of freedom&#133;&#148; 

&#147;We are the 3 holy shooting stars&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Star Fighter!&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Star Maker!&#148; 

&#147;Sailor Star Healer!&#148; 

&#133;&#147;Sailor Starlights&#133;Are Here!!!&#148; 

&#147;Oh thank God!&#148; Moon said. &#147;Sailor Moon try the tier again!&#148; Mercury 
said. &#147;Ok. SILVER MOON&#133;CRYSTAL POWER&#133;KISS!&#148; Sailor Moon shouted; still 
nothing. &#147;I don&#146;t think it&#146;s a person that was turned into a youma.&#148; 
Maker said, &#147;Mercury, can I see your computer?&#148; 

&#147;Uh sure.&#148; Mercury said and handed her the mini computer. As Maker 
typed the vines started creeping towards them once again, but only 
Moon noticed. &#147;Uh guys&#133;&#148; she started. &#147;Not now Meatball Head!&#148; Mars 
said. &#147;GUYS!!&#148; 

&#147;What is it Odango?&#148; Fighter asked. &#147;The-the-the v-v-v-vines ar-ar-are 
c-c-c-coming back- k.&#148; Moon managed to say. &#147;The what?&#148; 

&#147;The vines&#133; the vines&#133;&#148; 

&#147;What about them?&#148; 

Mars managed to make out what Moon was saying, &#147;She said the vines are 
back!&#148; she said. The vines rose above the senshi, &#147;STAR SERIOUS 
LASER!&#148; Fighter shouted. Her attack destroyed the vines and the senshi 
clapped for her saying, &#147;Yeah Fighter!&#148; The monster reappeared, &#147;I 
guess I underestimated you guys, but I won&#146;t this time!&#148; it said. Then 
vines appeared and wrapped around the senshis&#146; arms and waist, &#147;I see 
now that you can&#146;t attack without having your arms free, ne?&#148; it 
asked. Then the vines stared electrocuting them as a gold crystal came 
out of their brooches. &#147;Now I have your Love Crystals. Without these 
there&#146;s no way you can survive.&#148; the monster said. 

When the Crystals fully emerged the senshi stopped screaming, the 
vines still holding on to them. The monster was about to leave with 
the crystal when a blinding white light appeared in the center of the 
room. A woman with silver hair, a long white dress, and had clear 
white butterfly wings in the back appeared. &#147;Queen Serenity&#133;&#148; the 
Inner Senshi, except Moon, said. 

[CM] 

The crystals were returned to the senshi and were released from the 
vines. &#147;Okaasan,&#148; Moon said. &#147;Yes it is me musume (daughter), I have 
come to help you. You and Sailor Star Fighter are the true rulers of 
Crystal Tokyo.&#148; Serenity said. &#147;Really? How?&#148; Moon asked. &#147;You will 
find out sooner or later. For you to destroy the monster; you and 
Fighter must kiss for then will your new power appear. To transform 
you will need the senshi to upgrade you to transform. To do so you 
must shout &#145;Moon Crystal, Make-Up&#146; and &#145;Fighter Crystal Star, 
Make-Up.&#148; 

&#147;Thank you Okaasan and good-bye!&#148; Sailor Moon said. &#147;Bye my Princess.&#148; 
Serenity said and disappeared. With that the Senshi used their power 
to upgrade Moon and Fighter, 

&#147;MOON CRYSTAL&#133;&#148; 

&#147;FIGHTER CRYSTAL STAR&#133;&#148; 

&#147;MAKE-UP!!&#148; 

Sailor Moon still had her wings only they were more like angle wings. 
She had one star earring and the other was a crescent moon erring. Her 
boots were gold and white as was her skirt that had now two layers. 
Her brooch a star and crescent moon, she still had no tiara. Fighter&#146;s 
was the same except no wings or tiara. Crystal Sailor Moon turned to 
Crystal Sailor Star Fighter, &#147;Seiya-chan, we have to kiss!&#148; she said. 
&#147;Why?&#148; Fighter asked slightly blushing. &#147;It&#146;s the only way to make my 
new scepter appear. I know you may not want to, but-&#148; Moon was cut off 
by Fighter kissing her with a long deep kiss. 

When it ended Sailor Moon was shocked and stunned, but enjoyed it. 
Sailor Moon&#146;s new scepter, the Love Scepter, appeared in her hands. 
&#147;GOLDEN STARMOON LOVE POWER!&#148; Crystal Sailor Moon shouted. A golden 
glow began to show from the scepter and the monster was destroyed by a 
very powerful golden energy blast. &#147;Finally!&#148; Sailor Moon said. 

After school Usagi asked the Starlights where they were staying. &#147;We 
haven&#146;t found a place yet.&#148; Seiya said. &#147;Well&#133;you can stay with me 
until you find a place Seiya-chan.&#148; Usagi said. &#147;Where did that come 
from!?&#148; Rei asked. &#147;What?&#148; Usagi asked. &#147;Must be your lucky day 
Seiya!&#148; Yaten said. &#147;What?&#148; Usagi repeated. &#147;She still doesn&#146;t know?&#148; 
Taiki asked. &#147;Of course not.&#148; Rei answered, &#147;She&#146;s Usagi!&#148; 

&#147;Can someone PLEASE fill me in here!?&#148; Usagi asked. &#147;Nothing, you 
wouldn&#146;t understand Usagi-chan.&#148; Makoto said. &#147;Taiki-san, you could 
stay with me for a while if you want&#133;&#148; Ami said blushing a DEEP shade 
of red. &#147;Ami-chan!&#148; was the only thing Minako could say. &#147;Need help 
with your homework huh?&#148; Rei said grinning at Ami. Ami hid her red 
face behind her books, &#147;Gomen nasi.&#148; she said. &#147;I hope you two don&#146;t 
study TOO hard.&#148; Yaten said, everyone except Usagi, Ami, and Taiki 
started laughing. &#147;What&#146;s wrong with them studying?&#148; Usagi asked and 
they stopped laughing and sweat-dropped. 

&#147;Only Usagi-chan you say something so dumb&#133;&#148; Yaten said to herself. 

Soon after that Usagi and Seiya were walking to Usagi&#146;s house, &#147;You 
know&#133;my parents aren&#146;t home and they won&#146;t be for a month so stay as 
long as you like!&#148; Usagi said. &#147;And what if they were home? Would you 
still want me staying at your house?&#148; Seiya asked. &#147;Of course 
Seiya-chan, you&#146;re my best friend and I don&#146;t want to see any of my 
friends homeless.&#148; Usagi answered and hugged her. Soon they were 
inside Usagi&#146;s house, &#147;Where&#146;s Luna-san?&#148; Seiya asked. &#147;She was in my 
room the lat time I saw her.&#148; Usagi answered heading up the stairs to 
see if Luna was still there, Seiya followed her. When they entered her 
room there was no Luna, &#147;Hmm, maybe she went to go see Artemis.&#148; Usagi 
said. 

&#147;So, Odango, where&#146;s your Mamo-chan?&#148; Seiya asked. Usagi, who was 
looking put the window, turned to face Seiya, &#147;Mamoru-san isn&#146;t apart 
of my life now&#133;&#148; Usagi said and turned back to the window. </pre>
