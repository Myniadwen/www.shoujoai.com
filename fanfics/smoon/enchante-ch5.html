<h1>Enchante (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/enchante-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The rain pounded at the windows, making the multi-million dollar tower 
thrum like a large percussion instrument. I sat in the kitchen, 
watching my tea grow cold and listening to music, allowing a soft 
melancholy wash over me. Gustav Mahler&#146;s Lied von der Erde played on 
the stereo, fueling the darkness within me, reaching in and drawing it 
out to join the leaden light from outside.

The fact was, I was missing Michiru badly. She was playing a 
mini-concert series in Kyoto and I had meant to join her tomorrow. The 
rain outside had, however, pushed back the race for which I had 
remained in Tokyo. Now I&#146;d have to race tomorrow or forfeit the points 
on the circuit. I sighed petulantly, making the most of my bad mood. 
If Michiru were here, she&#146;d leave me alone for just long enough, then 
insist we spend some time together, and force me out of my grim frame 
of mind. I could hear her voice echo in the empty apartment and 
laughed darkly at my own morbidity. It sometimes scares me, how 
dependent I am upon her light. 

I paced a bit, watching sheets of water hurl themselves at the window. 
If the weather cleared up, even a little, I&#146;d drive out of town and 
ease my mood. The thunder crashed hard, shaking the walls, forcing 
that idea from my mind. The soprano on the stereo wailed her 
hopelessness and I stood, just letting her bleakness fill me.

I went back to the kitchen, put up water to heat for a fresh pot of 
tea and tried to think of something on which to concentrate my mind. 
They call this the &quot;monkey mind,&quot; the uncontrollable mind, the one 
that wanders and jumps and randomly switches from subject to subject. 
It was aptly named. I was unable to find anything with which to occupy 
myself. I glanced in the direction of the piano, but it held no appeal 
for me today.

&quot;Get a grip on yourself, Haruka.&quot; I said out loud. I was becoming 
morose and it irritated me.

The water heated and I made a fresh pot, determined to find some 
relaxation and leisure for myself. As I was about to sit, there was a 
knock on the door.

I called out, wondering who would come over in such appalling weather, 
and headed towards the door. It opened with a jerk and an extremely 
wet and downtrodden looking guest stepped in. Her shoes were off, but 
she was soaked through to the bone. She stood in the doorway, clothes, 
hair and umbrella dripping profusely on the floor and smiled a bit 
crookedly up at me.

&quot;I don&#146;t want to come in any further, Haruka-san, I&#146;ll ruin your 
floor.&quot; She wiped ineffectually at her face with a drenched sleeve. 

&quot;Ko-neko-chan, I mean, Usagi!&quot; I began a bit awkwardly, &quot;What brings 
you out in this weather?&#146;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry to barge in on you like this&#133;&quot; she began to speak at the 
same time as I, then stopped. She laughed a bit nervously, tilting her 
head. &quot;I came to cheer you up.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; I stiffened, surprised and confused. A moment went by, then I 
realized how rude I was being. &quot;Why don&#146;t you come in? Don&#146;t worry 
about the floor&#133;&quot; I ushered her into the living room and grabbing a 
few towels from the bathroom, handed them to her to towel herself dry.

When her hair and face were no longer actively dripping, I asked her 
to join me in the kitchen for some tea. Usagi held her arms and trying 
not to shiver, she nodded.

I poured from the new pot and held a cup out to her. She took it with 
hands that were almost steady and sat heavily. I watched her, her 
cheery nature warring with her dismal appearance and laughed out loud.

&quot;This won&#146;t do. You&#146;ll have to get out of those clothes or you&#146;ll 
catch cold.&quot; She looked at me with a wry smile. &quot;Come with me.&quot; I 
waved her towards our bedroom.

I pulled out one of my sweatshirts and a pair of Michiru&#146;s pants. &quot;I&#146;m 
sorry, the pants will be a little long, but you should be able to make 
do&#133;.&quot; She thanked me profusely and apologized for being so much 
trouble. I smiled as I left her. &quot;Ko-neko-chan, you are never any 
trouble.&quot;

In the kitchen, in consideration of Usagi&#146;s penchant for snacking, I 
threw together a tray of cookies and for the third time, heated some 
water. I wondered if I would drink a whole cup of tea at all today. 

I heard Usagi enter behind me. I turned and tried not to smile at her 
appearance. My sweatshirt was long enough on her to be a dress, and 
the sleeves hung past her hands. She had forgone the pants altogether, 
leaving her legs childishly bare. She had rung her ponytails out, and 
they stuck stiffly out from her head. If it weren&#146;t for the mature 
body under the clothing, she would have looked like a child. In fact, 
she did look like a child, her eyes large and bright, looking up at me 
mournfully. But there was a mocking gleam in them that was not at all 
childish. Disturbingly, I was not sure which one of us she mocked. 

I set the tea and snacks on the table, which made her jump where she 
stood.

&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried, &quot;I completely forgot!&quot; she turned on her heel and 
bolted out of the room. She returned in a moment with a pink bunny 
wrapped parcel. She handed over to me with a bit of a grimace. 
&quot;Mako-chan made some cookies for you, but I think they&#146;ve gotten wet.&quot;

I stared at her, this bundle of enthusiasm, this unbridled energy 
source, who stood so unselfconsciously in my kitchen. The very air 
around her seemed charged with life. I shook myself out of my reverie 
and took the proffered bag.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; I managed to say, somewhat belatedly. 

She tilted her head and looked at me closely. &quot;Are you feeling well, 
Haruka-san?&quot;

I didn&#146;t answer, but opened the bag and put the only-slightly-soggy 
cookies on the tray. Without turning to face her, I asked, &#145;What did 
you mean, when you said that you came to cheer me up?&quot;

She stepped up and put one small hand, covered by the excess sleeve, 
on my arm. Her voice was quiet, but concerned. &quot;I know that when 
Michiru isn&#146;t around you get depressed.&quot; I looked at her hand and she 
let go and covered her mouth, hiding a smile. &quot;And I had something to 
ask you.&quot;

I &quot;hmphed&quot; at the implication that I was predictable and depressed. I 
knew it was true, but I&#146;d be damned before admitting it. I could hear 
her giggle and busied myself needlessly with the tea. She sat down at 
the table and I sat, facing her, watching as she ate cookie after 
cookie. It always amused me to watch her eat, so joyfully, so 
mannerlessly, just like a child. I caught myself - I was doing it 
again. This girl was no child, as her lithe movements, and brilliant 
eyes attested. I was not aware that I&#146;d been staring until she caught 
my eye and pinned it mercilessly. Again, I saw that mocking flash and 
was immediately chagrined.

Neither of us moved, no words were spoken for a long moment. I moved 
my mouth to speak, but could not. What the hell was she doing to me? 
Was she here to practice some new power, some ability to bewitch? I 
realized that young as she was, she was no longer unaware of herself. 
Nor was she completely calculating, either. Was this a game to her? 
What were the rules?

In that silence I thought of Michiru and how much I loved her. I 
almost dropped my head, until I heard her voice in my head. We had 
been laying in bed, one long, hot summer evening and she was staring 
into my face. I told her I loved her for the first time and she had 
responded with the same words. We had gazed long into each other&#146;s 
eyes. Then she sighed and closed her, leaning her head on my shoulder. 
&quot;But there is someone we will love more, even than each other.&quot; I 
hadn&#146;t answered at the time.

Several months later, after the Silence had been barely averted, we 
challenged this very same girl to combat, not believing her to be our 
Princess. Her power had defeated us utterly and we had kneeled before 
her. At that moment, I looked up and realized at once what Michiru had 
meant. Before us, shining and glorious stood the one we would love 
more than even each other. It was both a horrifying and uplifting 
moment, as if we were confronted by a goddess. Now, in my own kitchen, 
that very goddess had me pinned to my seat and speechless. I squirmed 
like a child that was being interrogated for some trespass or 
misdemeanor. With a laugh, she let me go and I nearly fell backwards 
in my effort to escape her.

&quot;What the hell was that?&quot; I found myself saying out loud.

She looked at me guilelessly. &quot;What are you talking about Haruka-san?&quot; 
I shook my head and glanced at the clock. Not even a minute had gone 
by, maybe 10 seconds or so. I turned back to my guest who was once 
again eating cookies and drinking tea. I sipped from my cup and let 
the bitter liquid calm me. I could hear my breath rasp, as I sought to 
quiet my pounding heart.

Usagi looked up as the music ended. &quot;What were you listening to? It 
was very depressing.&quot; 

&quot;Lied von der Erde.&quot; I said shortly. &quot;What would you like to hear?&quot; 

She thought for a moment. &quot;Something happier.&quot; I nodded and escaped 
with what dignity I could muster. I had no idea what she had done to 
me, but I felt wrung out, as if I had fought something much too strong 
for me. As I reached for the CD, I saw that my hand was shaking. I 
placed a new CD on the player and stepped back to check for another 
selection. I could feel her step up behind me and I began to shake 
visibly.

&quot;Haruka-san?&quot; she asked, &quot;what is the matter?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; I said honestly. I turned and looked down into her 
blue eyes, so open, so loving, so compassionate. I tasted salt and 
brushed my hand across my cheek, startled to find it wet. She reached 
up and wiped a tear away from my eye with her little bunny 
handkerchief. She pressed the cloth into my hands and clasped her own 
hands over mine. 

&quot;What are you afraid of?&quot; she asked simply.

The words wrenched themselves out of my throat. &quot;You. Myself. Of not 
being strong enough.&quot; And I bent my head into my hands, the tears 
running freely down my face. She held me for a moment, until I twisted 
away, trying to gain some small control of myself. &quot;Why did you come 
here, Usagi?&quot; I asked, my voice uncharacteristically bitter. &quot;Why are 
you doing this to me?&quot;

&quot;Because you&#146;re lonely.&quot; I whirled on her, ready to tell that that was 
ridiculous, that she could not have known how I felt from across town. 
But I could see in her eyes that she *did* know, she *had* felt it.

&quot;Princess.&quot; The word came to my lips and I sank to one knee, not even 
knowing what I mean to do. Was I waiting for her command, or was I 
offering her my fealty? I had no idea. I no longer was in control of 
this and I no longer had any desire to be.

Usagi walked over and put her hand on my head, which was bowed. &quot;How 
can I cheer you up, Haruka-san?&quot; She leaned over me and lifting my 
chin, kissed my cheeks. I looked up at her and let myself be pinned 
once again by her eyes. This time I didn&#146;t try to fight it, allowing 
her to see into my soul, all my fears, all my wishes. Even my feelings 
about her. Michiru had seen them clearly, but I had never admitted the 
truth of her intuition. I should have known better.

I could feel her arms reach around my neck and pull me in, her lips 
laid gently against my own. She was warm, vibrant. I could feel my 
blood pulsing in my head, and a rush of excitement sped down my spine. 
Usagi let her lips linger against mine for a long moment. She said 
something I could not hear and my eyes closed.

When I opened my eyes once again, I could not see anything at all. I 
panicked for a moment and tried to clear my eyes by blinking, but 
something impeded my sight. I reached to remove the obstacle, but my 
hands were immobilized. I could feel a soft surface against my back - 
I was laying naked on my bed. Not the futon I had used when I lived 
alone, but the low, soft bed I shared with Michiru. I tried to free my 
eyes, but a soft hand soothed me and a voice spoke calmingly, right 
against my ear.

&quot;Please stop fighting me, Haruka-san.&quot; I could feel her breath 
tickling me and I turned towards her voice. &quot;Trust me.&quot; I didn&#146;t think 
I had much of a choice, but then, I knew as a certainty that I did. 
The choice was mine. I chose to trust her.

Her lips passed over my own and I reached for her, but she was already 
gone. I wondered how I had gotten here. I couldn&#146;t remember, surely we 
must have walked, but why did I remember flying? A hand caressed my 
face so gently, then disappeared. Another hand touched a leg. The 
sensations lingered on my skin after the hand had passed. Then her 
lips came back to mine, and one hand moved through my hair, crushing 
my face to hers. The other hand stroked my arm, neck and shoulder. I 
relaxed backwards and allowed her to carry me away with sensation. 
Then I felt an odd tickle on my leg. It wasn&#146;t a hand, but it moved up 
to my thigh with a steady, but light touch. I could not identify...I 
gasped slightly. Usagi had parted my lips and her tongue found mine. I 
reached for her, cursing my bound arms. She held me, bruising me with 
her mouth and I fought to get at her, but I was held fast. Her arms 
gripped me tightly and pulled my bonds taught, her stroking becoming 
deeper, more demanding. Then I felt it again, a whisper of a touch 
along one leg, then the other. Then a soft breeze passed over my body. 
Usagi broke our kiss and I fell backwards.

I knew she was still next to me, I could feel the warmth from her 
body. She let one hand graze my breast, followed by a warm mouth. I 
moaned and threw my head back. I could hear her laugh a little, then 
repeat the gesture. A strange change in the air occurred, then a soft 
blanket, warm, yet incredibly fine, was drawn over me. It ran along my 
sensitized skin, tickling, caressing and finally embracing me. With a 
sudden shock, I could feel feathers against my arms, my torso and my 
legs. My skin shuddered with the sensation.

Usagi laughed once again and pulled me close to her using her wings 
like arms. My bonds were taught and my body arched. Usagi laid herself 
above me, then eased herself onto me slowly, fitting our bodies 
together. She continued to caress me with her hands and her wings 
teased at me, tickling my neck, then an ear, then a leg. I began to 
moan uncontrollably, surrendering myself to the unfamiliar, ethereal 
sensation. Usagi began to kiss me, so softly that at first I was not 
sure I could feel her. Then more firmly and finally, once again, 
drawing me in and crushing our bodies together. I had to remind myself 
to breathe or I would black out.

Usagi shifted and I felt the stroke of feathers once again against my 
legs. She moved off of me and I whined, but was cut off as the wings 
began to caress me, touching inner thigh, moving up my legs until it 
withdrew just before it reached the junction between my legs. I cried 
out, but the cry changed as the feathers tickled my nipples. Usagi 
licked one, then the other, rolling them around her mouth and biting 
them lightly. I began to beg her for...what? I didn&#146;t know, but she 
did. One wing moved over me, running lightly through my pussy, then 
again. 

I was straining my bonds, I could hear them creaking with the effort 
of holding me. Usagi opened me with one hand, while her other hand 
teased my breast. I was panting now, no coherent words could be heard, 
but my need was obvious. Usagi entered me easily and began to fill me. 
She shifted once again and let one wing drape itself across my chest, 
just to torture me. The feathers got into my nose and mouth, but also 
laid across my breasts, warm and soft as a blanket. I gladly breathed 
in Usagi&#146;s wings, while she pumped her hand into me. 

When her tongue touched me, I though my head would explode. I could 
feel my eyes roll back into my head, feel my body force itself upward. 
Her tongue dug into my slit, then drew up and across my clit. I 
yelled, and dropped back as she left me. Again, then again, she teased 
me and finally, agonizingly, she began to lick me with a steady 
rhythm. In a very short, too short time, my body became rigid and I 
came with a groan, calling her name. She kept licking me until I asked 
her to stop. But before she left me, she kissed my clit, then, leaving 
her hand inside me, kissed me on the lips.

We lay like that for a while, and finally she reclaimed her hand. My 
shoulders were aching and my ankles sore from the bonds. I was just 
about to ask to be released when she spoke.

&quot;You can open your eyes, if you want.&quot;

I opened my eyes to see her only a few inches away. Her radiant blue 
eyes staring directly down at me. I lifted one hand to feel my face 
and it came away with no effort. I brought both hands in front of me, 
but no marks were to be seen on my wrists. I looked at her in wonder.

&quot;How?&quot; I asked, bewildered.

She shrugged, trying to supress a grin. &quot;Trade secret.&quot; I looked at 
her, she was naked, but no signs of the wings were to be seen. She 
smiled mischieviously and her eyes reclaimed my attention.

&quot;You had something you wanted to ask me?&quot; I remembered her saying that 
a long time ago.

&quot;It&#39;s been taken care of.&quot; she waved away the thought. I furrowed my 
brow in consternation. I felt completely bewildered. She continued. &quot;I 
simply wanted to cheer you up.&quot; I found my facial muscles and framed a 
doubtful smile.

She laid her body against mine, curling up into my shoulder. One hand 
traced my collarbone. &quot;Minako-chan came to me and told me what you and 
Michiru did for her.&quot;

Where was this leading?

&quot; And so did Rei-chan, Ami-chan, and Mako-chan.&quot; 

I didn&#146;t answer. My body felt light, as it hadn&#146;t in years. Not since 
before I knew I had a destiny, a power or a Princess. I found it hard 
to concentrate on her words.

&quot;They said that you had graciously given of yourself, given them 
something that they needed. None of them know about the others, you 
know. Only I do.&quot; She smiled sweetly at me and I smiled back, knowing 
all about girls and their secrets. &quot;I&#146;ll admit, I was incredibly 
curious, too, after all that they told me. So, I thought you might 
like someone to give you something that you need.&quot; Her eyes sparkled 
with impishness.

&quot;You have. Thank you.&quot; I found my voice at last. She kissed me on the 
nose and bounced out of bed. I watched her slip my sweatshirt over her 
body.

&quot;I have to go now, Haruka-san. Thank you for taking care of my 
friends. I&#146;ll just get my clothes from the bathroom.&quot; She turned away 
from me.

&quot;Wait!&quot; I called. &quot;What about....what about you? Isn&#146;t there anything 
you want?&quot;

She smiled at me over her shoulder. &quot;Yes, there is. And I have a date 
with him in about two hours. I have to get home and change.&quot; She 
winked at me and left the room.

I dressed, and paced in the living area until she came back out from 
the bathroom. The rain hadn&#146;t stopped, but it was much lighter. I 
handed Usagi her umbrella. I bowed formally and she laughed at me, but 
bowed back.

&quot;Cheer up, Haruka-san. Tomorrow you will win that race and Michiru-san 
will come home the day after.&quot;

I smiled at her words. &quot;The world is really very simple when you speak 
like that.&quot; I said.

&quot;The world is really very simple.&quot; she said enigmatically and walked 
out of the door. She called over her shoulder, &quot;Thanks for the tea!&quot;

I stood in the doorway and waved after her. &quot;Thank Mako-chan for the 
cookies.&quot;

&quot;I will!&quot; And she was gone.

I went back into the apartment and turned on a few more lights. I 
turned on the CD player and the light-hearted strains of Mozart&#146;s 
Clarinet Concerto in D minor filled the room. I took a book off of the 
shelf, sat down and began to read.

As darkness finally covered the gray city, there was a noise at the 
door and Michiru walked in, unexpectedly. I stood, dropping my book 
and with a small cry, she came over to me. We embraced tightly and 
kissed. 

She laid her head against my chest. &quot;I missed you. I didn&#146;t want to 
play without you there to hear me.&quot; I heard the uncertainty in her 
voice, the unwillingness to burden me and I tilted her face up to see 
me.

&quot;I wanted to hear you. More than anything else.&quot; 

&quot;I told them I wasn&#146;t feeling well, but that I&#146;d return for tomorrow&#146;s 
concert.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll go with you, after my race. I wouldn&#146;t miss one of your 
performances for anything.&quot; I looked down into her blue eyes, and felt 
incredibly happy.

We kissed again and I lead her into the bedroom. We made love then, 
and slept, limbs entwined with one another&#146;s, like a perfect dream.
