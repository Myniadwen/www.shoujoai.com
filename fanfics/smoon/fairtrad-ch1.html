<h1>Senshi Passion: A Fair Trade</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Summary: First in a series of Short Stories of various (mostly 
unexplored) encounters among the BSSM crew. I warn you in advance, 
most of this stuff will border strongly on PWP and most of the parts 
are stand-alone stories, some might fit into the same frame though. 
This one is about Usagi and Naru set after Episode 95 of S &quot;Koi no 
otasuke ha Moon ni omakase&quot; that ended in here with a twist and a not 
so fortunate ending for Naru.

Author&#39;s Notes: This is sort of a challenge for me. I want to see if 
I can write a few stories that are actually short and worth something 
(even if only as a lemon). Let&#39;s see where this takes us.

------------------------------------------------------------

Osaka Naru had a bad day. A really bad day. No, really. For weeks she 
had suspected her often nerdy but nonetheless often sweet boyfriend 
to keep a secret from her, maybe even hiding unfaithfulness - not 
that she really feared any competition - which turned out to be a 
harmless case of shyness from both sides. They both had been 
reluctant to surprise the other with a ticket for the lover&#39;s 
contest. Naru had been happy and maybe a tad bit nervous but the baka 
of a boyfriend had not totally humiliated them throughout the whole 
competition. No, that she was used to, would have been forgiven with 
not more than a second thought if not...
	&quot;Oh, forget him already. He&#39;s not worth it when he can&#39;t even 
express how he&#39;s feeling about you.&quot; Tsukino Usagi, best friend of 
Naru - not to mention the famous Sailormoon - had accompanied her 
friend home after the tournament disaster, knowing fully well how it 
was to be dumped by someone... Okay, it&#39;s not like Naru was dumped. 
But after giving a speech that missed any kind of passion for the 
girl you love, using such phrases like &quot;She&#39;s a great friend&quot; or &quot;The 
other guys actually envy me for once&quot; and similar things that spoke 
of much but not of someone who would sacrifice anything for his love 
as it had often seemed. The whole thing sounded clinical, without 
heart and as if read from a textbook. Even Ami had been offended.
	And now the two friends were sitting at the Osaka&#39;s home, 
watching television and sulking at the unfairness of life. Well, Naru 
was sulking and moping while Usagi tried to cheer her up. The blonde-
haired girl realized that she had been rather neglecting her duties 
as a best friend lately. They had been drifting apart rapidly and the 
idea with the contest was actually meant to do something remotely 
together again.
	A fine idea that had turned out to be.
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry I even got you two together. I mean, of course, 
what should someone like Umino know about making a girl happy? All 
he&#39;s concerned about are his grades and information, right?&quot; Usagi 
continued to ramble but her friend just sat there rather listlessly 
staring at the screen. It didn&#39;t appear as if she was really 
following the events.
	Silence reigned between the two girls for awhile before Naru 
suddenly stood up, declaring that she would be taking a shower. 
Sighing heavily Usagi watched her friend go. Frustration at the lack 
of response to her tries of cheering the brunette up was getting to 
her nerves. Have I been the same when Mamo-chan dumped me? She 
wondered and considered the possibility as being rather likely.
	It was a shame really. First the thing with Nephrite and now 
that. Her friend definitely deserved better than to have her heart 
constantly broken. She was such a gentle, supportive and caring 
person, not to forget a kind one. Naru had put up with many of 
Usagi&#39;s shortcomings since they knew each other - and that was from 
the beginning of elementary school. The brunette had an aura of 
innocence around her that had even managed to penetrate Metallia&#39;s 
control over Nephrite. But unlike herself Naru was also clever, had 
good grades in school... To summarize it bluntly. Osaka Naru was much 
too normal to be normal. If that even made sense.
	Tsukino Usagi loved her friend for all of this. Loved her as 
best friends used to be and sometimes even more. Naru wasn&#39;t a 
ravishing beauty but not bad-looking either and she DID attract some 
attention here and there. It had started in fourth grade, Usagi 
believed, but she always had a slight crush on her friend. Nothing 
major. Nothing to really compare with what she felt for Mamoru but 
nonetheless there.
	And right now? Right now Tsukino Usagi was outraged that life 
was treating such a wonderful, beautiful person so badly. So, 
according to Usagi wisdom(r) if life wasn&#39;t showing her best friend 
the respect she deserved, she had to take matters into her own hands.
	We all know how this ends...

*********************

Meanwhile Naru was relaxing under the shower trying to think about 
nothing in particular. Especially nothing concerning a certain &quot;human 
being&quot; called Umino. Still she wondered if the monster had been blind 
or made with some kind of malfunction. Pure heart, feh, sure. Maybe 
if the world ended and everyone else except Guiro Umino died then he 
might be inclined for the title. Maybe it really had been blind and 
meant to aim at her or someone else instead. Yes, that thought was 
much more reassuring.
	After Usagi had once again saved the heartless baka&#39;s life 
Naru had not even spared him a glance of worry. Should he wake up 
without her or any of the others nearby. That would suit him just 
fine. Oh yes, Naru knew that her best friend was Sailormoonm, had 
known it a long time. Whatever protection they had seemed to be not 
working with her after sometime and Usagi was her best friend after 
all. You just knew such things, a simple illusion or whatever it was 
couldn&#39;t conceal the truth from you. Several incidents had convinced 
Naru that her suspicions were sound and after meeting her friend in 
the final phase of that giant black crystal growing in the middle of 
Tokyo she had been certain. Usagi was Sailormoon and her friends the 
other Senshi. If you had one figured out, the rest were easy.
	Naru had never bothered to bring the subject up. It would 
only make her friend uncomfortable. After all she was doing a rather 
good job of keeping her secret concealed, just not good enough for 
someone you knew for about eight years of your life.
	The auburn-haired girl occupied herself with not thinking 
about Umino, focusing intently on the routine task of washing and 
some thoughts about her best friend whom she often tended to envy for 
her growing circle of friends that she seemed to not fit in anymore 
and of course her absolutely dreamy boyfriend. It was not that Naru 
didn&#39;t wish her best friend every happiness she could get but she 
often found herself wishing to be a more active part of that. Before 
she had had Umino but now... Now that wish had become even stronger.
	So engrossed in her thoughts meant to distract herself Naru 
might be forgiven for not hearing the bathroom door quietly open or 
soft footsteps from the other side of the curtain. She might be 
forgiven for not noticing the movement or the shower curtain being 
pulled back slightly. Naru did notice, however, a pair of slender 
arms coming up around her and hands lightly brushing over nipples 
that were already erect from the cold water she tended to use.
	&quot;Nani...?&quot; Her protesting &quot;eep&quot; that she had actually planned 
turned into a low, involuntary moan as her nipples were flicked 
between two fingers each, pulling a little and then releasing. 
Craning her neck to get a look at her assailant her suspicion was 
quickly confirmed as she came face to face with one grinning Tsukino 
Usagi who appeared to be quite pleased with herself. A thousand 
questions and/or protests were tumbling over each other and at least 
half of it was ready to spill from her lips. Nothing of it was ever 
voiced.
	Unprepared and certainly shocked as she was Usagi had her at 
a severe disadvantage which the blonde quickly made use of. Pulling 
her friend against her own naked form, enjoying the sensation of her 
own breasts against the slightly shorter girl&#39;s back, her lips 
captured Naru&#39;s with that kind of breathtaking passion that would 
leave your mind blank from anything other than the sheer sensations 
pouring into you. Mamoru had always said she was a good kisser. A 
playful description he once used was, &quot;Now I know why you eat so 
much. That and kissing both has to be done with the mouth.&quot; She 
hadn&#39;t been angry at this remark at all.
	Naru was reeling from the intensity of the kiss. She wanted 
to close her eyes but that loving and determined gaze from sky-blue 
eyes held her captive. There was a glimmer of mischief but for the 
most part unconcealed affection. Affection for her. She wasn&#39;t as 
dumb as to think this was about love. This was more like a favor. An 
uncharacteristically favor from Usagi, or so she had thought.
	Usagi on the other hand found the whole encounter a rather 
natural thing to do. Granted Mamoru and her had not done that much 
but she was sure the few times would never get her friends quiet 
again if she ever mentioned it. By law they were too young for that 
after all. Usagi didn&#39;t care much. They were Senshi and that had a 
welcoming bonus. Their bodies developed much faster than those of 
others.
	&quot;Shh, forget Umino. I make you feel better.&quot; Before Naru 
could protest Usagi kissed her again, quickly gaining entrance to the 
quite eager mouth of her best friend. A slight gasp was drawn from 
the other girl as she sucked her tongue into her mouth and nibbled a 
little, while her hands began massaging Naru&#39;s mounds a little 
firmer. Rational thought began to rapidly flee from the auburn-haired 
girl&#39;s mind and she felt herself surrender to her friend&#39;s touch.
	Another moan escaped her lips when Usagi moved to her neck, 
softly nipping on her flesh and surprisingly skilled fingers flicked 
her nipples again eliciting a curious mixture of pleasure and pain 
when one was twisted and another stretched quite a bit out of 
proportion. But Usagi never really hurt her friend, restraining her 
Senshi-given strength. The blonde-haired Princess might be the 
physical weakest next to Ami within the Senshi but that still meant 
that she was a lot stronger than the average human.
	Naru for her part was enjoying the attention her friend was 
granting her, having long since given up any form of protest. It 
simply felt too good. Other than Usagi Naru always had envied her 
friend for her beauty concealed after the often klutzy behavior. She 
wished she could have such natural golden hair or sparkling blue eyes 
and at times she had really wished to claim those lips which&#39;s smile 
could make anyone forget any animosity they might have against their 
owner.
	It was a little girl&#39;s fantasy. A child not really knowing 
what she was doing... Then Naru had learned that her best friend was 
this strong heroine and those feelings had flared again. There surely 
had been a bit of hero-worshipping involved. Never had she dreamed 
her friend would be willing to fulfill her fantasies. But now there 
they were, the cold water from the shower forming goose bumps over 
her skin as it tried to fight the sudden heat generated by her 
friend&#39;s touch.
	With a growl at the surely heated but by now much too slow 
pace that Usagi was setting, Naru turned in the embrace, surprising 
the blonde by catching her right earlobe between her teeth, sucking 
at it gingerly before flicking her tongue over it. Their breasts were 
smashed together as Naru tried to practically fuse their bodies into 
one. She was a little surprised by her own forwardness. Of course she 
had tried those things a few times on herself but she never had had 
sex before. Umino would have fainted at the idea alone, not to 
mention totally unaware of what to do.
	Usagi, however, was a totally different case. The aggression 
of her friend shocked her for just a brief moment, her body 
stiffening a little as she fought for control. A battle she was bound 
to lose. When Naru lowered her head to run her tongue over her left 
breast and sucking at one of the nipples a little clumsily that 
little bit of self-control she had managed snapped and the Senshi was 
set free. The adrenaline from fighting the Daimon was still in her 
and so Naru had not much time to react. Only a gasp of surprise and 
small protest rose from her lips when Usagi grabbed her by the wet 
auburn curls of her hair, shoving the helpless girl against the wall 
of the shower and down on the edge of the tube, legs spread with one 
forceful motion.
	The blonde could only hope that Naru hadn&#39;t taken notice of 
the flare of power because right now she was much more Sailormoon, 
Senshi and reborn Princess than Tsukino Usagi. But Naru for her part 
only stared up at her a little shocked but with an honest acceptance 
and surrender that left her somewhat breathless. The Senshi in her 
craved to dominate. Usagi knew that, and her friend had just allowed 
her free reign.
	Naru for her part was fascinated and her breathing had 
quickened at the sight of the golden crescent moon briefly flaring on 
her friend&#39;s forehead. She wasn&#39;t quite sure if she noticed but that 
didn&#39;t really matter. There was not much time for preparation as the 
stunning blonde warrior that clearly shone through now leaned down to 
once again kiss her with raw passion accompanied by a definite 
dominance. If it hadn&#39;t been for the strong grip of her friend Naru 
had surely rocked hard from the edge of the tube. As it was only her 
back was further pressed into the cool surface of the wall as Usagi 
entered her without warning. Two fingers probing her tight virgin 
cunt, tangling in her folds for only a split second before diving 
further, sending a small wave of release through the powerless girl. 
Naru was glad by now that she was more or less sitting and leaning 
against the wall because by now her legs surely had gone weak. That 
first bit of release was just the beginning. Usagi didn&#39;t leave her a 
moment to breathe, curling her fingers inside of her, one against her 
clit and one probing even further inside, she used her other three 
fingers to stroke along the inner thighs and entrance to her nether 
lips.
	&quot;Usagi!&quot; a shrill screech erupted from Naru as her friend 
switched attention from her throat and neck to her breasts. The 
suckling was far beyond anything gentle. It wasn&#39;t violent yet very 
powerful and potent. Licks and nibbling was followed by gentle and a 
bit harder bites while all the while Usagi&#39;s fingers set a relentless 
pace that had Naru quiver and squirm beneath her in the first few 
seconds.
	&quot;Kami-sama, yes...&quot; Naru hissed when Usagi used her other 
hand to glide under her butt, lifting her young but delicately firm 
buttocks from the edge, running her fingers over the smooth surface. 
Abandoning Naru&#39;s burning center for the moment the blonde Senshi 
used both hands to steady the other girl and gain a little bit more 
leverage. The groan of disapproval quickly turned into an audible 
moan under the ministrations of her best friend&#39;s fingers dancing 
across her rear entrance.
	For a moment Naru was a little shocked at the unsuspected 
treatment and unsure of what to think about it but when Usagi 
carefully entered her with one finger doubt once again flew from her 
mind, quite effectively killed by the surprisingly pleased reaction 
her body was giving.
	While Usagi might enjoy the different course of action for 
awhile - something she quite liked herself but Mamoru and her rarely 
did - there was something she was yearning to do ever since starting 
this. Distracted as Naru was the blonde chose this as the perfect 
opportunity to dip down her head in one fluent motion. &quot;Usagi, 
what...?&quot; The other girl never managed to finish the sentence. Had 
Naru&#39;s mother come home in the meantime she surely would have 
wondered about the murdering scream of pure rapture coming from the 
bathroom. Even muffled by the sounds of the running shower it was 
loud enough to be heard in the living room.
	The sudden feeling of having her best friend&#39;s mouth clamped 
over her most private area made Naru jerk with the electricity the 
contact produced. Even Usagi&#39;s strong hold was not enough to hold the 
girl completely steady as the blonde began to lap at the sweet musky 
flavor of her friend and nibbling at the sensitive flesh with a 
feverish passion.
	Completely unexpected was the motion of one of Naru&#39;s legs 
snapping up in response to the bolts of pleasure coursing through 
her. She couldn&#39;t stop the momentum and so her left knee collided 
with Usagi&#39;s own center. Focusing all her attention on her friend had 
left Usagi quite unfulfilled herself and the cold water running 
across her back and in-between her legs did not help either. And so 
the short flare of pain was taken more as a stimulating sensation. 
Moving her own need against her friend&#39;s knee Usagi quickly became 
overtaken by the passion of the moment herself and let the last 
restraints fall as the finger in Naru&#39;s behind was pushed as far as 
she could master inside. Naru let out another cry as her clit was 
sucked into her eager friend&#39;s mouth, teeth not actually absent in 
the whole process.
	Unconsciously one hand was tangled in golden hair to push 
Usagi&#39;s head even further inside while another was playing with her 
own breasts. Naru&#39;s vision was obscured by flashes of white and other 
colors as she felt a tsunami building inside her. A high tidal wave 
ready to come crashing down any moment.
	And when the release finally came it was like a gigantic 
explosion unrivaled by anything she had felt in her young life up to 
this point. Naru threw her head back against the wall and let loose 
with another mixture of a gurgling scream and chanting her friend&#39;s 
name over and over while Usagi continued to drink every last bit of 
cum from the girl that was overtaken by passion. The smell was 
intoxicating, a little bitter but tasty at the same time. Grinding 
her own wetness harder against Naru&#39;s knee the energy in the air was 
enough to draw out Usagi&#39; own release while she felt her friend&#39;s 
hand moving to her back, nails digging into soft flesh.
	For several timeless and seemingly infinite moments both 
girls held the pose, their bodies going rigid, neither one willing to 
fully let go of the moment, then reality set back in and Naru slumped 
against the wall. Usagi carefully licked the remaining cum of her 
friend and trailing a path of butterfly kisses up her body, finally 
wrapped her arms around the spend girl.
	Placing a tender kiss on the other girl&#39;s lips Usagi stroke 
her face that right now was totally peaceful and relaxed in those 
moment of post-rapture. &quot;You okay?&quot; she asked Naru after awhile, the 
sound of the still running shower the only background noise other 
than their breathing that slowly returned to normal.
	&quot;Yeah... barely,&quot; Naru mumbled, leaning into the tender 
caress of her cheek. &quot;That was... wow...&quot;
	Usagi just nodded with a satisfied grin. Seeing the relaxed 
state and calm of her best friend was worth all the effort. And she 
could tell there was no misunderstanding between them. Naru knew what 
Usagi had tried to do, keep her thoughts away from Umino and right 
now there was no thought wasted for her lost boyfriend. The lost 
chances simply paled in comparison to what her friend had just did to 
her.
	&quot;Arigato, Usagi-chan... Sailormoon...&quot;
	Usagi paused for a moment, wondering about the statement but 
when Naru smiled at her knowingly she realized that she had never 
managed to fool her best friend and that it was alright. If there was 
one person outside her Senshi she could trust it was Naru.
	&quot;Anytime, Naru-chan,&quot; Usagi whispered and then with a sly 
smile added. &quot;I guess we have to clean up again, hmm.&quot; Naru answered 
her with a kiss, a certain school geek long forgotten. As much as 
Naru was concerned he could very well sit at his homework right now, 
oblivious to what he was missing. She simply chose to enjoy the 
moment of unconditional friendship with her best friend. A more than 
fair trade, she thought.

Across town Guiro Umino sneezed, twice.

Author&#39;s Notes

Wow, and that in... Uh... Nearly four hours. Quite quick, huh? And I 
kept it short, really did.

Yes, that was rather uncommon for me. A plain lemon. I tried to give 
it a bit more depth with the background but can&#39;t really deny that 
this was simply to your and mine (hey, I&#39;m only human) enjoyment.
I hope you did, enjoy, I mean.

I have no idea how big this will one time be, so don&#39;t ask me. This 
was is definitely one I&#39;d like to exploit a bit more thoroughly later 
on but don&#39;t push me.

What you can expect further? Hmm, I have a few things in my head I&#39;d 
like to be seen. Such as an Usagi/Luna (and Chibiusa/Diana if we are 
on the subject) or a few others I&#39;ve not quite decided on yet. But 
you won&#39;t find common pairings here. At least not very often and if 
then mostly with someone else included. Let&#39;s just see where this 
takes us, yes?

Oh, and Maia is really in a good mood. Now that I have this from my 
mind for my moment the next episode of TFG is well on their way. You 
guys from the list can already expect a draft soon.

Give me feedback on how you liked this, please. Feedback is essential 
for an author and I&#39;m not much of a lemon author usually.

Ja ne, yours
