<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 18 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Three figures appeared in the richly decorated French room of nothing 
but white. Rei Hino set her wife down softly so she could stand. Terri 
wobbled a bit but steadied and walked around the room. Ami scrunched 
her nose.

&#147; Who decorated this place?&#148; Terri laughed.

&#147; Johnny, he said nothing but the best. I&#146;m so glad our dimension 
isn&#146;t so bland. Now why were we here?&#133;Oh yea! Stella!&#148; The old woman 
came in quickly as she always did like magic. 

&#147; Oh Miss Jena! I was so worried about you!&#148; The white haired Senshi 
smiled at her friend.

&#147; I&#146;m fine Stell. My memories came back, my name is Terri Hino. I&#146;d 
like for you to meet one of my best friends Ami Mizuno and my husband 
Rei Hino.&#148; Stella turned to the two strangers and smiled. That is 
until she noticed Rei was a woman.

&#147; Your&#133;married?&#148; Terri frowned slightly.

&#147; Indeed. August sixth. Is that a problem for you?&#148; Stella shook her 
head still slightly shocked.

&#147; No dear. Just a mild shock. People may do as they wish. I&#146;m pleased 
to meet you both.&#148; Terri grinned at her.

&#147; Stella, I have to leave to go back home. I want you to come with us. 
Please think hard on this. We&#146;re not from this&#133;erm&#133;dimension&#133;&#148; 
Confused Stella thought about it.

&#147; Not from this dimension? Is that possible?&#148; The three nodded.

&#147; Well it must be better than here. I&#146;ll go.&#148; At that moment the door 
pushed open and Johnny Smith walked in. Followed directly by the very 
blonde Seth Givens. 

&#147; Jena! Who are they?!&#148; Seth looked at the women his employer was 
pointing at.

&#147; Hey! It&#146;s the dykes from the other day! J what&#146;s going on?&#148; Terri 
clenched her teeth.

&#147; First off my name is not Jena! I am Terri Hino and they are with me. 
We&#146;re leaving.&#148; Terri motioned for Stella to grab her hand. Ami and 
Rei joined hands with the two. Johnny Smith watched as they 
disappeared.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

The four arrived in the hotel room where Rei and Ami had been staying. 

&#147; Stella, don&#146;t freak out, but we need to transform.&#148; Stella watched 
again confused as to what was happening. 

&#147; Universal Destiny!&#148;

&#147; Universal Mars!&#148;

&#147; Universal Mercury!&#148; 

Lights flashed and soon before Stella stood three sailor suited 
warriors. Surprise mingled with shock on her wrinkling face.

&#147; I&#146;m going to open the rift now. Stella hold Mercury&#146;s hand, she&#146;ll 
guide you through.&#148; Mars grabbed Destiny&#146;s hand.

&#147; You just got your memories back, your energy could still be to low 
to do this&#133;&#148; Destiny smiled up at her love.

&#147; Don&#146;t worry Firebird. I&#146;ll be just fine. Think of it this way, if I 
pass out, you have a reason to hold me.&#148; Mars blushed and stood back. 
Energy formed into a ball of swirling black and smashed it&#146;s way into 
the dimensional fabric. Looking very much like it was going to shoot 
back at them, but instead ripped through and created the whole needed 
to get home. 

&#147; Let&#146;s go!&#148; Mars and Destiny jumped through immediately followed by 
Mercury and a scared Stella.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

Another whole opened within the empty chapel of the Crystal Palace. 
Once the rift closed the three sailors detransformed only to shimmer 
again and replace their clothing for royal gowns. 

&#147; Terri? Where or when exactly are we?&#148; Terri giggled.

&#147; We are in the year 3006. Our world is much different than that you 
know of. Don&#146;t worry soon you will know all you need.&#148; Terrestria 
draped an arm over her friends shoulders and they began a search for 
the others. 

They walked around the large Palace as the Queens answered all of 
Stella&#146;s eager questions. Soon they came upon a red haired maid 
dusting some antique sculptures.

&#147; Excuse me Miss?&#148; The red head turned and bowed to the royals 
nervously. 

&#147; Oh that&#146;s really not necessary. Please stand&#133;much better. Do you 
happen to know where I might find Neo-Queen Serenity?&#148; She gulped and 
nodded.

&#147; I believe she and the other High Queens are in the Fire room, west 
wing your Majesty.&#148; 

&#147; Thank you Miss.&#148; Each bowed to the still startled maid and continued 
their walk. Soon enough they reached the red door in the west wing 
that belongs to the fire room. Serena and the others didn&#146;t not hear 
the door open as they stayed quiet and stared deeply into the fire. 

&#147; Serenity.&#148; Two balls of gold popped up and she turned her head from 
the fire. She gasped and grinned happily, vaulting over the couch. 

&#147; Terri!&#148; Terrestria enveloped her sister in a hug and grinned into 
the smaller woman&#146;s hair.

&#147; Oh Terri, we&#146;ve missed you so much! I&#146;m so glad your back!&#148; The 
others crowded around and swarmed over Terrestria as if she were fresh 
meat. Finally Serenity took notice of the old woman she did not know.

&#147; Who&#146;s this?&#148; Terri went to her friend.

&#147; Sere meet Stella Allison. Stella meet Sere.&#148; Stella shook hands with 
the Senshi she hadn&#146;t met. 

&#147; Serena, I need you to give Stella the knowledge of how our world 
works and stuff like that. Plus some info on us so she doesn&#146;t get 
confused.&#148; Serenity nodded and the crystal shimmered into her hand. A 
light shot to Stella&#146;s head and in a blink was gone. The old woman 
wobbled afterwards.

&#147; Oh my! I was right to come to this world with you dear.&#148; The Queens 
smiled at their new friend.

&#147; So Stell, how are you with pregnant woman?&#148; Stella became thoughtful 
and looked at the younger woman.

&#147; I&#146;ve taken care of three I believe, it went fairly well. Why do you 
ask dear?&#148; Terrestria placed and arm over Serena&#146;s shoulders.

&#147; Serenity is pregnant and soon she will need someone to help her with 
things. Luna and Artemis are cats and they can&#146;t do the things she 
will need soon. What do you say?&#148; Terri glanced at both Stella and the 
Neo-Queen. Serena grinned happily and shook Stella&#146;s hand.

&#147; Well then it&#146;s settled. I&#146;ll have Luna set up a room for you near 
mine.&#148; Rei smiled at them all and pulled Terri next to her.

&#147; Hey Ames, is our honeymoon still booked?&#148; The blue haired Queen took 
out her mini computer and typed for a second and it popped away again.

&#147; Yup! All set and ready.&#148; Rei grinned from ear to ear.

&#147; Good! We&#146;ll see you in a month then!&#148; 

&#147; What?&#133;Eep!&#148; Terri squealed out as Rei dragged her away.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

Rei and Terri Hino walked up to the door that led into their lavish 
suite. The raven haired one swept her surprised wife into her arms and 
opened the dark brown doors. They kissed over to the couch where they 
plopped down, Terri laying her head on her husbands shoulder.

&#147; I love you Firebird.&#148; Rei grinned.

&#147; I love you too Dragon.&#148; The two stayed quiet for awhile.

&#147; What would you like to do first?&#148; Rei put a slim finger to her chin. 

&#147; How about swimming? We are in the Caribbean.&#148; Terri smiled and 
snapped her fingers. Her shorts and shirt flickering into a black 
bikini that showed her off nicely. Rei stared bug eyed at the sight 
before her. Terri had never worn such a suit. 

&#147; What&#146;s the matter Rei? You&#146;ve seen me in a bathing suit before.&#148; Rei 
snapped back to reality.

&#147; I can&#146;t help it if your hot.&#148; Terri giggled but soon took on the 
same expression upon seeing Rei in her fire red bikini. Rei chuckled 
and took her hand.

&#147; Yea, you must love me now.&#148; Terri pecked her cheek and they were 
gone in a flash.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

People watched as two beauty strolled across the sands in bliss the 
heated sun swimming over them. They walked along for awhile. Rei 
finally caught the stares all the men were giving her love and glared 
at them. Lucky for them they took the hint and looked elsewhere. Terri 
got to do some glaring herself and placed a tanned arm around Rei&#146;s 
tiny waist to get everyone to stop ogling her Rei. 

&#147; Well it&#146;s you and me Dragon for a month. What would you like to do?&#148; 
Terri grinned and pulled her towards a rental shack that was farther 
down the sandy beach.

&#147; let&#146;s rent skidoos!&#148; Rei laughed as she was dragged down the beach.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Ha ha ha! Did you see her face? Teaches her to hit on my husband!&#148; 
Rei only laughed and followed her lover to the large master bedroom. 
It was almost nine o&#146; clock by the time they had gotten back to the 
hotel Ami and Setsuna had booked for them. Terri decided to change 
normally for once and walked into the bathroom. Rei had her own 
surprise and changed into it. The negligee she had bought was a dark 
purple which brought out her eyes. As she placed on her robe the door 
of the bathroom opened and she turned. Blushing immediately at the 
sight of Terri. The Queen stood in the frame wearing a navy blue 
negligee and a broad smile. She gracefully walked over to Rei, 
swinging her hips just a little, enough to hypnotize her prey. Rei 
stood captivated as strong arms slid around her neck.

&#147; You know Firebird there&#146;s one thing I&#146;ve always wanted to do.&#148; Rei 
gulped.

&#147; What&#146;s that Dragon?&#148; 

&#147; Explore.&#148; Rei never got another word in as red full lips met her 
own.
