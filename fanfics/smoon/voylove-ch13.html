<p>When Winds and Tides Harmonize</p>
<p><strong>Haruka's POV:</strong></p>
<p>“I hate you.”</p>
<p><em>What a charming way to greet  someone in the morning.</em> Rather  than say that, a small groan came out, as I tried to open my eyes.   The resulting upliftance of a certain rather comforting weight woke  me completely. My eyes adjusted to the filtered sunlight just barely  in time to see my Michi beginning to walk away. I scrambled to my  feet as hastily as I could.</p>
<p>“Wait-  Michi!”</p>
<p>Shuddering  horribly, she paused to shout back, “Don't call me that!”  before continuing onto wherever it was that she was planning on  going.</p>
<p>Me being who I am,  I easily caught up to her, gripping her wrist and whirling her  around. “Come on, Michi, don't be like this. I'm all for a  routine morning walk, but aren't you going to at least tell me what's  gotten you all snippy again?”</p>
<p>The  way she glared at me then, eyes blazing, a redness still around them  as a result of crying, I felt my breath come up short. In my sight,  she was never moreso beautiful, if but only she wasn't angry at <em>me</em>.</p>
<p>“I hate  you.” She stated it simply, and then, as an afterthought,  added, “I don't think I could hate you even more right now than  if you and I both tried.”</p>
<p>I inwardly  grinned, a small spout within me desiring to defy her, just to prove  her wrong; she saw it, I suppose, and wrenched back around, preparing  to begin walking once more.</p>
<p>“Leave me alone.”</p>
<p>But I only took her back into my arms,  as I had the night before, putting forth all my effort to calm her  down, and to have my Michi returned to me. “Don't say that,  love,” she flinched at that, and I realized I had yet to tell  her that I'd loved her, though I knew it well enough inside me. I  amended it in my next phrase, “Ah, I'm mixing dreams with  reality again. See, I told you in my dreams that I loved you- I love  you in reality too, don't you know- and you said you loved me back.   So what is it that makes you hate me now, so much unalike my dream  Michi?”</p>
<p>I think she had an inclination to  growl at me then, but her self restraint is greater than that, and  she merely started walking. At least, she tried to, but I held her  back. “Let me go.”</p>
<p>“Tell me.”</p>
<p>She remained silent for a while  longer, and then relented, apparently believing that I would let her  go if she talked. “You leave me for nine years, and then after  the first day we remain in each other's company, you expect all the  holes to be filled? You are different from when I remember you last,  but at the same time, you are no different. I hate that. You are  the source of that hatred, and therefore, I hate <em>you</em>.   Now let me go.”</p>
<p>I  wanted to laugh at her last request, but I managed to pull back the  urge. “You don't think after all that I'm just going to let  you <em>go</em>, now do you?   I've always cared about you, Michi. No one knows me better  than you do. To some extent, I don't think anyone else can tolerate <em>the real you</em> more than I can.   Maybe I'm a little different- you are too- but we were kids when we  last saw each other. Of course I'd like to get to know you again,  and you me.”</p>
<p>“Will you  return to the Kingdom with me?”</p>
<p>I hesitated, as I  had no previous inclination to do so before thus. “I won't go  back to the Kingdom. Not to stay.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”  She seemed to genuinely wish for me to agree, but at the same time,  she also wanted to be privy to my reasons.</p>
<p>I hugged her  closer to me; her anger seemed to have all but disappeared with our  short walk, as she had no objections now. “I... there's  nothing there for me, Michi. Sure, I'm supposed to be the Queen's  protector, but the Queen doesn't need me there to foul up and hit her  while aiming for the enemy.”</p>
<p>Her voice  softened, and I imagine her eyes did too, at that moment. “That  was just once, Haruka. She forgave you, and she wasn't hurt too  badly either.”</p>
<p>The self-loathing  from long ago rose to the surface. “Once is enough, when it  comes to life and death matters! I.. I won't risk it again. At  least here, out at sea, I don't have to worry about restraining  myself.”</p>
<p>“Haruka...”   There was a fairly lengthy silence, before she tried to speak again.   “It doesn't-”</p>
<p>At that moment, I  put a hand over her mouth, and glanced around warily. There was  something close... something dangerous... I whirled the both of us  to face it, and found myself looking at the hugest snake I had ever  seen. I couldn't see the majority of its body, but from the bulk of  its frame, resembling that of tree trunks, I guessed it wasn't your  common garden snake- or even cobra.</p>
<p>I knew Michi was  trying very hard not to scream, though we both knew that all snakes  were deaf, but I think she was also just too numb from surprise to  get her vocal cords working.</p>
<p>Bending low,  keeping my eyes on the snake, I whispered, “Want me to kill it?   I know how you hate snakes, Michi.”</p>
<p>To which she  whimpered, “<em>Can</em> you kill it?”</p>
<p>I smiled at that,  but as I straightened, I patted her shoulder in an attempt to show  support. “Don't worry; I'll take care of it. Start towards  where we were heading before and I'll catch up in a few.”</p>
<p>If it hadn't meant  averting her gaze from the possibly flesh eating snake, I'm sure  Michi would have turned to stare at me. Her voice proved it well  enough. “You want me to run away...? And without <em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yup,”   I stepped in front of her, slowly summoning my saber (the special  talisman one) to my grip. “Unless you want to be close of  enough to smell the stench of it when I cut it up, you'd better get  going. Just walk slowly, and when I charge, you can run full  sprint.”</p>
<p>“Ruka... I  can't.”</p>
<p>The snake was  wondering if we'd be good enough to eat, I'm sure, else it wouldn't  be waiting so long. Its tongue continued to flicker midst its data  gathering, even as I whispered back, “What's wrong? Got stuck   in a mud puddle? 'Course you can.”</p>
<p>“I'm not  going to let you make me a hypocrite, Haruka.”</p>
<p><em>How would  that...? Oh, right...</em> My mind flew back to the night before.   It was only to get some firewood and dinner, but she'd asked real  quiet for me not to leave her... if she ran off now...“Don't  think of it like that. Hey, I stayed when you asked me to stay, so  just think of it as returning the favor if you escape when I ask for  you to escape. All right? Come on, the snake's getting edgy, I can  tell.”</p>
<p>She was quiet for  a long time, but then I heard her take a step back. And another.   The snake noticed, too. Like any proud predator, the snake was not  about to just let a prey escape from right under its nose, especially  not one so much slower, surely, and one that smelled so delectable.</p>
<p>As it lashed out,  I ran towards it, using my wind to push me forward, and the backlash  to push Michi farther away. “RUN!”</p>
<p>Michi's never been  one to be frozen in fear. At least, not for very long. She ran. To  assure myself that she'd escape safely, I set my sights on beheading  this monstrosity. At just the right moment, I made a diagonal jump.   Normally, the fact that my target was rushing towards me at the same,  give or take a little, speed, wouldn't matter. As it was... I failed  to watch out for the tongue, and it grabbed me from the air.   Wriggling as I was, arms tied to my sides, I wasn't in any position  to whack off my bonds, unfortunate as that is.</p>
<p>Ah... how  depressing- I tell Michi that I'll take care of it- let her run- and  then five seconds later I'm about to be snake food. How lame. <em>Ah  well.</em> I thought, as the snake got ready to chomp me in pieces- or  swallow me whole. <em>At least she got away, thinking I died a hero  or somethin'...</em></p>
<p>It wasn't until  the snake had closed its maw with me inside that I came to a  panic-inducing revelation: <em>If I don't stop this snake... who's to  say Michi won't be joining me in here?</em></p>
<p>The thought sent a  surge of power in me, and, avoiding the venomous fangs, I transformed  into my Senshi fuku, and set about letting loose a personal favorite  at the thing's throat. “World Shaking!” It was an  afterthought... painstakingly late, that made me realize how  destructive that attack would be in such enclosed quarters...</p>
<p>Wherever she was,  Michi <em>had</em> to have heard the explosion, as I did what I set out  to do- obliterate the head. The only thing was... had it not been  for my Senshi endurance, I would have been toasted along with the  snake. As such... I instantly lost consciousness, most likely having  infinite bruises, abrasions, open wounds, and... and so on...</p>
<p><strong>Michiru's POV:</strong></p>
<p><em>Haruka...!</em> The explosion still echoed in my mind, even as I turned on my heel  and headed back the way I had come. We'd promised, I know, long ago,  to not worry about the other, so long as one was alive to continue  protecting the Crown, but...</p>
<p>I stopped at the  edge of the clearing. The tears that had dried the night before due  to Haruka's comforting returned with a vengeance at the sight of her  marred, limp body. Choking back at sob, I reserved further judgment  after checking the status of the area. The snake was dead, no doubt  there- the remains of its head nearly made me wish I hadn't returned  at all- and Haruka...</p>
<p>I rushed to her  side, and carefully checked her pulse. It was there. Beating  strongly. I let a soft sigh of relief escape my lips as I looked her  over more extensively. The stench and the blood, I'm almost certain  was all due to the snake, but, as I ran my fingers lightly down her  arms, feeling the cuts that were clotted... surely in danger of being  infected... I began to worry all over again. <em>What if she got  poisonous venom into her system? What if... what if it... it...</em></p>
<p>Roughly, I shook  my head and focused my mind on finding the nearest source of water. <em>The closest is... the lagoon my mirror showed me before...? I  wonder if that'll be enough...</em> I looked back at Haruka. <em>Can  I carry her? Should I be moving her in this condition? Will she-</em></p>
<p>I  stopped my thoughts again, trying to concentrate on what I'd  remembered from the health lessons taken during my youth in the  Kingdom. <em>There are too many cuts to be sure of which one  might sport fatal poison... if any do at all... and it's also been a  while since the explosion, so if she's still alive now, it might be  probable that moving her won't aggravate her wounds even further... </em>I  consulted my mirror, as well as concentrating on where the other  Senshi signatures were. The results surprised me, even as unguarded  as I was at that moment.</p>
<p><em>Makoto and Ami  are at the lagoon... or at least, they're very close to it. And  there are many life forms collected at the beach but why...?</em> And  then it hit me. Or rather, the ocean current whispered it to me. <em>We  have our ticket out of here.</em></p>
<p>Strength renewed,  I carefully went about putting Haruka in a sitting position, and then  from there, deciding the best transportation would be carrying her on  my back. The resulting attempts to get her settled there proved to  be taxing all on its own, but by zenith time, I had succeeded in  starting off.</p>
<p>The  distance, I estimated, was about a kilometer- not far at all.   Though... with her on my back... Somehow, my mind stretched the  distance to twenty (kilometers). I really shouldn't have... I  really should have been on guard for any other large predators... but  with Haruka so near... my mind started to wander rather easily.</p>
<p><strong>Flashback</strong></p>
<p>“Miss Kaiou! We're having a new  arrival today- another Senshi, or so they say. We must hurry to  prepare you for greeting her!”</p>
<p>I wanted to roll my eyes at my  attendant, but being in front of the mirror, she would have seen me,  and then scolded me for doing such unladylike things.</p>
<p>How  dumb. I'm <em>six</em> years old. What's wrong with acting a little unladylike now and  then?</p>
<p>“Mm... Miss Kaiou, which one do you want to wear today?”   The nurse held up a sea green dress and a white one. “Just  pointing is fine, you know. Which one?”</p>
<p>Ever since I set foot in the Palace, I haven't said a word. I hated  my parents for forcing me out of the House of Ocean, out of their  lives. They didn't even tell me why. I was supposed to protect the  Queen? I'm so much younger than her! She can take care of herself.</p>
<p>I pointed to the green dress. Somehow, white just wasn't in my  plans today.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was nudged out the door, primped and  proper-like, as I've heard the maids whisper. Geez... all this  trouble for another rugrat? Why bother? I was told there are seven  other senshi, and I've only seen Pluto-san. So this would make the  third. Wow. What's so great about that? If you'd won third place  in a contest, in my House, you'd be a disgrace.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was  with great annoyance that I stopped at the top of the stairwell, and  looked down to the parlor. There was a soldier... most likely a  guard, but his garb was not of regular Palace militia. The  newcomer's...?</p>
<p>Asking for  something while being resolute to not speak is tough, but I did it  fairly well in my opinion. I wanted to ask what he was standing  there for, but I remained silent as I walked down the steps.</p>
<p>He saw me coming.   He seemed to sense that I was at least someone of higher rank than  himself, for he bowed until I'd reached the end of the staircase.   Then, “Ah, Miss, I'm sorry to trouble you, but I'm afraid I've  lost sight of my charge. She's a rather mischievous child, and the  wind helping her run away isn't of much help to me. Mightn't you  know where she is?”</p>
<p>I stared at him.   Shifting his weight from one foot to the other, he continued to  fidget restlessly. A grown man asking a child for directions to his  charge? How... pitiful.</p>
<p>“Ah she's to  be the Senshi of Wind, you know, Uranus.” The man bobbed his  head up and down rather nervously. “Sandy blonde hair...  should be around your age I suppose. Ah... I really shouldn't be  asking this of you...”</p>
<p>By then, I was  ignoring him. I looked down the hall, unfocusing on my surroundings,  in order to pinpoint what would be a new, but noticeable, aura. It  was a recent trick that Pluto-san taught me, and it was as of yet  still fairly ineffective.</p>
<p>But this time...</p>
<p>A flash of gold  blinked in my mind's eye.</p>
<p>Now where...?</p>
<p>I caught the  glimpse again as I slowly turned my head.</p>
<p>West?</p>
<p>For reassurance, I  concentrated a little harder, and I pinpointed the signature, and  then I saw an image of a table decked with food...</p>
<p>I  snapped my eyes open, and headed for the kitchens. I didn't  bother beckoning him to follow. I would meet her and get it over  with. This really was such a bore- why must <em>I</em> be the one to greet them? Just because Pluto-san is already grown up  and the Queen's advisor...</p>
<p>He paused, looked  both ways, and then nervously scuttled after me. Bumbling dummy.</p>
<p>Up and down the  halls we went, the kitchens being actually rather far from the  parlor. At every junction, I would stop and concentrate again,  making sure she hadn't moved. Not even when we had reached the  kitchen doors, had she moved even a foot. She was eating to her  heart's content after all.</p>
<p>I looked around  and the cook saw me almost instantly. She exclaimed her surprise and  pleasure at seeing me, asking what she could do for me. I only shook  my head, and headed to the banquet table that had all the finished  dishes that were to be for today's luncheon... and a few already made  dishes for tonight's reception. I studied the table, gazing at the  random spaces that I found, before deciding to use my senses to pick  up where she was.</p>
<p>Now that she was  nearby, the fleeting sensation was a lot more solid, and as I had  recent practice, I succeeded in pinpointing her easily.</p>
<p>Walking over to  the place where the aura was strongest, I took a deep breath, and  raised the table cloth.</p>
<p>There she was.</p>
<p>I almost grinned,  at the way her eyes darkened with fear, wide with surprise. There  was an incriminating plate of spaghetti next to her.</p>
<p>The dummy escort  came up behind me. “Miss Tenoh! There you are! What...   Really, now, a future lady such as yourself... what a disastrous  first impression this will make...!”</p>
<p>She continued to  stare at me, with those unnerving blue eyes, even as the man helped  her out, and the chef hurriedly wiped her mouth with a warm towel.</p>
<p>Finally, she  asked, not moving even when the man beckoned her to, “Who are  you?”</p>
<p>I sniffed  haughtily and turned away, already starting towards the door. A  ruffian. A barbarian. This was to be my teammate? Oh what horror I  could foresee her unleashing on our balls and banquets!</p>
<p>Just as I was  about to leave, my hand already on the door, she called out, “HEY!   How rude! Tell me who you are!”</p>
<p>I said nothing as  I continued through the door, but as I waited, I was rewarded in  hearing the chef murmur, “Oh, Miss, don't you fret over Miss  Kaiou. She hasn't spoken a word to anyone ever since coming to the  Palace.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence, and I  wondered what it was that made me stay where I was. I had better  things to do than hang around here, waiting to be caught... didn't I?</p>
<p>“Kaiou... What's her first  name? And what house is she from?”</p>
<p>I heard the older man scold her  lightly, “Miss! Asking such things... here of all places! Ah,  I apologize for my charge's rudeness. Come, you're sure to see her  again later, at the banquet if nowhere else. Now we must get you  settled in. Come along!”</p>
<p>Footsteps. They were coming. I  wanted to move. I really tried. But... there was a spark then, then  that I knew... I barely managed to step far enough away so as to not  be hit by the door.</p>
<p>I heard her voice again, crystalline  clear. “You're still here...? Ah, perfect then.” I  turned to regard her. “I just remembered, when you want to  know someone's name, it's only proper to say your own name first,  right? So...” She stuck out a hand, giving me a cheeky grin.   “The name's Haruka. Haruka Tenoh. I'm from the House of  Gale.”</p>
<p>I stared at her... and she only  grinned back. She didn't mind leaving her House. Or at least, she  didn't let that hinder her. To steal from the kitchens on the first  day...</p>
<p>It came out before I could stop it.   An exhale... a small smile... I managed to cover my giggle with my  hand. It was over soon after it began however, and I turned halfway  to leave.</p>
<p>The smile was still on my face as I  murmured, “Michiru Kaiou. Future Lady Neptune.”</p>
<p><strong>End Flashback</strong></p>
<p>Ah... our first  meeting... I hadn't spent even one minute in her presence, before she  completely undid my two, three months of silence. By the end of the  day, we were virtually inseparable.</p>
<p>“Mi-  michiru-san? Is that you?”</p>
<p>I looked up  suddenly, and realized that I had reached the embankment, and Ami was  now rushing towards me.</p>
<p>“Oh my,  what happened to Haruka-san? Ooh... come on, there's a medical tent  nearby. How far did you carry her? Are you hurt? Wha-”</p>
<p>I couldn't help  but smile at her, shaking my head again. “I'm unharmed. We  were confronted with a giant snake, and Haruka fought it. I... I  wasn't in a position to see what happened, but the snake was killed.”</p>
<p>She watched me  for a little while longer, before nodding and waving over Makoto.   With her help, we made short work of transporting Haruka the last leg  of the trip. While she was being attended to, Ami and Makoto filled  me in a little of the situation I had come across.</p>
<p>Apparently, one  of the crew members had been flung ashore with a portable  communications radio, and with Ami's help, put it back into working  order. They'd sent an SOS signal out, and it would just so happen  that Captain Aino's ship, returning from the port city, picked up the  call and were on their way. And so, they all decided to head for the  largest lagoon, and now, all but the Princess, Rei, Setsuna, and  Minako were accounted for.</p>
<p>Of course, to  the Senshi, these were the most important people of all.</p>
<p>“Should  we go back out to search for them?”</p>
<p>Ami shook her  head. “I have them tracked on my computer. It seems that  they're heading for that hill in the center of the island. When they  get there, we'll make a smoke signal, and from there, at the very  least, Rei will know to head there.”</p>
<p>“What  if... they're in trouble?” They were taking this a little too  casually for my liking.</p>
<p>Makoto seemed  to sense this and smiled. “No, they're all fine. Ami's  computer also keeps track of their health and status, so even if they  do run into trouble, we'll know.”</p>
<p>Eventually, I  simply sighed and shook my head. Just as I was about to leave,  Haruka woke up.</p>
<p>“Michi...?”</p>
<p>Her voice  startled me, even as we were gathered around her in the medical tent.   I placed my hand over one of hers, and she weakly grasped it. “I'm  here. How are you feeling?”</p>
<p>There was a  soft laugh that became a cough, before she whispered, “Bah... I  think I know why you hate snakes so much now...”</p>
<p>I smiled back  at her. “Rest up. We have our ship to get out of here- we're  just waiting for it to dock, and for the rest of the Senshi.”</p>
<p>“The  rest...” It was then that her eyes flickered over to Makoto  and Ami. “Ah, how goes it, guys?”</p>
<p>Ami softly  reprimanded, “Save your energy and rest, Haruka-san. With  these kinds of wounds, a regular human wouldn't have survived at  all.”</p>
<p>Haruka smiled  wanly. “Good thing I'm not 'regular', then huh?”</p>
<p>She closed her  eyes briefly, and her visitors were almost certain she'd fallen  asleep, when her eyes snapped open again. Haruka turned to regard  me. “Michi...! The... sea! Come with me... and we'll sail  the seas together! With my affinity with wind, we can avoid most  storms and speed won't be a problem. And... and with you and the  sea... we wouldn't have to worry much about wayward currents... or  whirlpools... perfect days at sea, Michi! Will you...?”</p>
<p>My thumb  lightly traced over the back of her hand as I responded, “And  what would we do, Ruka? I'll never become a pirate, even for you.”</p>
<p>Haruka's eyes  became downcast, but then Ami exclaimed, “Oh, that's right!   Well, I'm not about to wholeheartedly agree with Michiru-san's  involvement, but I did hear there was a space open in the Royal Navy.   Captain Bernough recently retired, and they're looking for someone  capable enough to take his place.”</p>
<p>While the idea  was immediately appealing, I kept my gaze on Haruka. She stared at  me back. “Well, Ruka? Do you want to still?”</p>
<p>She grinned.   “So long as I don't have to wear dresses to formal occasions,  and I don't have to be at the Kingdom for long periods... I have no  objections.”</p>
<p>I sighed again  with mock resignation. “Well then, unless your penmanship has  gotten any better since I last saw you- and I'll gander it's only  gotten worse- I suppose I'll have to accompany you to write out the  reports as well.”</p>
<p>Haruka grinned  wider. “If I could move, I'd seal the deal with a kiss. But  right now... augh... I probably stink something horrible too, so it's  better if we wait on that one.”</p>
<p>A soft giggle  rose from my throat as I nodded. “Yes. We can talk later.   Now sleep.”</p>
<p>“Yes,  Michi...” With that, Haruka trailed off, into a world where  she could dream of sailing the ocean blue with her one and only love.</p>
