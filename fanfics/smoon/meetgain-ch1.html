<h1>Until We Meet Again</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amber.html">Amber</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Hello! Alright, first and foremost, I hate all those terrible echhi fanfics 
about Chibi-Usa and Hotaru. (Fortunately, there aren&#39;t many!) I felt like 
cleaning up the whole Chibi-Usa-Hotaru deal in my own way, and what I think 
they will be. I was inspired, alright?! Comments are appreciated, as I have 
stated in many varied terms before. Questions too!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Small Lady Serenity, the time has come for me to leave this planet,&quot; 
Saturn said, looking eye-to-eye with the princess.
        &quot;Hotaru-chan...&quot; Small Lady&#39;s eyes were brimming with tears. Ever since 
she had returned from the Tokyo of the past, become friends with Saturn, she 
had realized that the senshi of destruction never remained on a planet other 
than her own for a long time. Not to mention, she had been on earth when 
Galaxia had attacked. If Hotaru had been dormant on Saturn, she may have been 
able to destroy earth before Galaxia stole her sailor crystal.
        &quot;Princess Small Lady Serenity, the world will go on without me!&quot; Saturn 
smiled, her eyes filled with tears too. Her comment had been kind of redundant.
        &quot;But...but...Hotaru-chan!!!&quot; The pink haired princess began crying and 
hugged the sailor senshi before her. &quot;It&#39;s...it&#39;s only one week!!! Couldn&#39;t you 
wait just one week?&quot;
        &quot;No, my Princess. I will be there in spirit, always.&quot;
        &quot;I was looking forward to seeing you there...&quot;
        &quot;Your coronation will be beautiful, Chibi-Usa. Just like you, I promise.&quot; 
The two looked in each others eyes, and Small Lady stepped back quietly. Saturn 
summoned the Glaive and disappeared in a flash of violet light. 
&quot;Farewell....Small Lady...&quot; Her voice lingered behind in Small Lady&#39;s heart 
long after the figure of her friend had faded into a dreamless oblivion.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Week Later,

        &quot;On this most important day, I hand my crown down to Lady Serenity, next 
in line of the noble blood of the Silver Millennium, which has risen like the 
phoenix from its ashes on the Moon to begin once more on the planet of Earth,&quot; 
Neo-Queen Serenity said as she took her crown off her head, &quot;And so forth, each 
planet in the Millennium gives alliance to our new Queen, so that the strengths 
and weaknesses, the gifts and the burdens, can be shared through our peace,&quot; 
Each senshi of the Old Court stood up. The blue haired Queen was first.
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Knowledge and Water, Mercury, I assign my 
world to the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot; 

Behind her, the black haired Queen of fire walked up and made her royal 
proclamation.
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of War and Fire, Mars, I assign my world to the 
allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot;

The next Queen, standing regally in her long green dress,
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Protection and Thunder, Jupiter, I assign my 
world to the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot;

Finally, the leader of the Inner Senshi made her decree,
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Love and Gold, Venus, and as leader of the 
Inner Senshi, I assign my world to the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot;

The next three Queens stood taller than those that came before, each with a 
degree of severity unmatched in the age. The first came forward and bowed 
before the new queen.
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Flight and Sky, Uranus, I assign my world to 
the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot;

The second, in her aqua-green dress, hair trailing behind her in waves, made a 
slow curtsy to the new queen, and held hands with the first.
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Embrace and Ocean, Neptune, I assign my world 
to the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot;

Finally, came forth the last senshi. Dark green hair swirled around her, giving 
her an aura of mystery. Her black dress trailed behind her, covering the carpet 
placed out for the royals to walk on like a shadow from the skies. Her garnet 
eyes stared into the queens own.
        &quot;On behalf of the planet of Reformation, Time, and Earth, Pluto, and as 
acting leader of the Outer Senshi, and as last planet in this solar system, I 
assign my world to the allegiance of the Earth and Moon.&quot; The old queen nodded 
to each of them as they made a circle around the new queen and bowed. The queen 
finally rose the crown above her head.
        &quot;These Seven planets, Earth and Moon, make our Millennium. Rise to hail 
the new queen! I present to you, Second Queen of Crystal Tokyo, Queen Lady 
Serenity!&quot; All the court rose and cheered. Serenity was now to make her first 
royal decree.
        &quot;Each of these planets are at peace with us as so declared today in the 
Crystal palace. Any member of Earth has a right to be on these planets to newly 
populate them. Only the Silent planet, Saturn, is outside the Millennium, and 
not to be touched. Now, let peace live forever!&quot; The queen stood triumphantly 
as cheers rose again. Her prince bowed once to her, and the two set off to the 
throne room. She was disappointed that Hotaru had not decided to join the 
Millennium. No one had been able to contact her, and she hoped that her decree 
would help keep things that way. It would be her friends wish.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Two Years Later,

        &quot;Helios...&quot; Queen Lady Serenity looked deep into the blue eyes of her 
prince. Today, today, thousands of years after they met, they would finally be 
wed. The Asteroid senshi each were her bridesmaids, the original senshi in the 
front row with her mother. Pallas had insisted on daisies with the roses, and 
had made each senshi carry a small bunch of them. Vesta had argued long 
afterwards, but Juno had said that the daisies were a nice contrast to the 
Queen&#39;s red roses. Ceres had even gone to the trouble of making Vesta leave her 
whip on a nearby table, so she could get it if she needed it, but wouldn&#39;t look 
like a complete fool carrying it in the middle of a wedding ceremony. the four 
had quarreled for hours, but Queen Lady Serenity ignored them all, her 
thoughts only to her and her prince finally being together, forever. Her father 
had walked her down the aisle. In her hands, she carried the bouquet of red 
roses, grown especially for her wedding by her father. She knew she must look 
beautiful, her white gown shining, her odangos trailing behind her, pink and 
airy. Her veil was almost transparent, and her golden moon ensignia was glowing. 
Helios&#39; earth symbol had begun giving off a soft glow as well. The priest 
coughed
        &quot;And in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish,&quot; He continued, 
but Helios and Serenity didn&#39;t seemed to hear him. When he stopped, Helios 
said,
        &quot;I do. I have always,&quot;
        &quot;And do you, Queen Lady Serenity, take this man, to be...&quot; his voice 
continued. Now, both the bride and grooms&#39; eyes were filled with soft tears.
        &quot;I do.&quot; Serenity said.
        &quot;Then I now pronounce you,&quot; He didn&#39;t finish, as Serenity kissed Helios 
passionately on the lips. The entire court of Queen Lady Serenity stood and 
applauded. (Along with a few hollers and whistles, too.) The old queen gave the 
woman she would always think of as Small Lady a quick embrace, as did her 
father, resplendent in his lavender tuxedo. Helios bowed before the pair, and he 
and his new wife ran down the aisle. The original senshi through daisies at 
them, filling the air with white petals. The Queen looked back for only a 
moment, searching for the one person who had not come, wishing on the heart of 
a wish that the familiar purple eyes would look back at her, but the only hue 
of purple was the lavender of her fathers tuxedo. The Queen looked at her 
husband again and smiled. This was the life she had chosen, and she should not 
regret it.
        &quot;Goodbye, Hotaru...my friend.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Five Hundred Years into the Future,

        Time passed into the waves of time, and the forces of Chaos rose once 
more from the hearts of darkness in the seas of beginning. Earth became the 
battle field, the final war for the blue planet had begun.

        The earth ravaged with darkness under the attacks. Cosmos had led the 
army, and had finally fallen. Her staff shone brightly over her head, still 
giving her strength.
        &quot;We fight on! Chaos will not have this world!!!&quot; The black storms sliced 
through the fallen forests, the crumbling mountains. Grey stone flew through 
the air and black lightning crackled over head. All that could be seen of their 
mysterious enemy was the black rolling clouds, sometimes a set of red eyes 
appearing from the mists, only to reappear miles away a minute later. Laughter 
boomed above them, but Cosmos fought on, her planet staff glowing brightly in 
her hands. In minutes, the entire army but Sailor Cosmos was brought to its 
knees. The storm flew past, now moving towards the crystal palace.

        Inside, the queen sat on her throne, breathing heavily. Her odangos 
trailed behind the throne, somehow looking as exhausted and weary as her. Her 
husband had died in the first battle, and now she was alone. Alone, by the 
final battles of her home, planet and kingdom. Cosmos, some vague power, a 
ghost of what had once been her mother, led the armies with such bravery and 
fierce determination that she had to wonder if the stories of Cosmos&#39; origins 
were true. She had heard of her from the Asteroids, guaranteeing peace for a 
thousand years, until Chaos was reborn. Now Chaos and Cosmos were at eternal 
war, nothing seeming capable of defeating either. Queen Lady Serenity stood up 
and walked to a glass case, in which, embedded in stone by the tip of its 
blade, was a sword. It had not been used for nearly two thousand years, but 
Venus and Neo-Queen Serenity had made sure to keep it safe. On the sword were 
the powers and words to encase evil, and good, in a seal. As the Queen of 
Crystal Tokyo, she had the right and power to use it. Venus had lead the first 
line of battle, the leader of the Outer senshi long since having faded into the 
memories of her past. The gold senshi had raised the blade in defiance against 
Chaos, glowing with energy. Each senshi had fallen, until the soldier of love 
had been the only one left standing, protected by the enchanted blade. She had 
lunged against Chaos, her golden energy shattering it only for a moment before 
the darkness had consumed her. She closed her eyes, and as she cried, the 
ginzhuishou reformed for her. Glowing from her tears, it sparkled silver before 
her. She must win this battle. The soldiers sacrifices would not be in vain. 
She lifted the case, the ginzhuishou glowing beside her. She would have to seal 
Cosmos and Chaos to properly seal it. The sword glowed orange for a moment, a 
glowing reminder of the senshi who had taken out half of Chaos&#39; forces in a 
glow of golden light before being struck down, dead, by that monstrosity. The 
sword pulled easily from the stone, and was lighter than she had expected. She 
held the blade in her right hand, the silver crystal in her left, and she 
filled the palace with power.

        Outside, The last of the armies were incinerated in the black blast. 
Cosmos finally stood squared to Chaos.
        &quot;You cannot defeat me, Chaos!&quot;
        &quot;Nor you me...&quot; it said in its deep voice. Cosmos began to glow a fierce 
white light, born of the cleansing forces of good, and Chaos mimicked the same, 
in the forces of darkness.
        &quot;We shall end this battle here...&quot;
        &quot;So you are the last player in this game...I thought as such.&quot; The two 
locked, blue eye for red eye. Suddenly, a great shattering noise came from 
behind them.
        &quot;What?&quot; Said Cosmos. The crystal palace had begun radiating streams of 
light, faster and faster till the glass like shards filled the air. Both Cosmos 
and Chaos protected themselves from the flying daggers.
        &quot;Who is there...&quot; asked Chaos.  A single pillar of crystal rose from the 
center of what had once been the palace, and on it stood the Queen. She raised 
her sword and pointed it at Chaos.
        &quot;You shall not rule this world!&quot; Shouted a voice, standing in the rubble 
of what had once been the pinnacle of Tokyo.
        &quot;I believe that I will,&quot; Queen Serenity&#39;s eyes began glowing, and she rose 
the sword above her head. The ginzhuishou embedded itself into the hilt. 
        &quot;Cosmos! Give me your power!!!&quot; The crystal shone, and the blade of the 
sword filled with light. Beams of light began falling from the sky, slowly at 
first, until light fell in waterfalls. Cosmos&#39; aura had expanded, all the 
energy being sucked into the ginzhuishou. Each ray of light sliced at Chaos... 
Like a thousand shooting stars, Serenity thought, to punish this evil. &quot;For 
love and Justice, and on behalf of the Moon, Chaos, and for my kingdom, I will 
punish you!!!&quot; The sword filled with light, and the sky grew brighter in a 
final display of dazzling light. Her power spent, Serenity fell to the ground, 
the sword clattering beside her, falling slowly, until it shattered against the 
now blackened earth.


        &quot;Small Lady....Small Lady...&quot; A voice came from above her. I have not 
been called that in years...she thought to herself. The voice continued, 
changing tones... &quot;Queen. Awaken. There is work to be done, and choices to be 
made.&quot; Serenity groggily got up and looked at the figure before her. Tired, her 
head hung low, she could still make out the purple boots. Please, she pleaded, 
don&#39;t let this be a dream...don&#39;t let this be a dream.
        &quot;Hotaru?&quot;
        &quot;Small Lady,&quot; a gloved hand helped her up and she looked into the purple 
eyes once more. She ran to hug her, but the now silent figure merely pointed to 
the west. &quot;Look,&quot; was all she said. The world was barren, no life, no trees. 
Even the highest mountain range that protected Crystal Tokyo had crumbled. The 
earth itself had become dark. If she could see it from space, Serenity would 
realize how much the Earth had begun to look like the long forgotten Nemesis.
        &quot;Where are Chaos and Cosmos?&quot;
        &quot;Sealed in the crust of this earth. More so, binded to this earth. Both 
are like star seeds from this earth, Queen. And can be destroyed with it.&quot;
        &quot;You mean....&quot; she looked at the soil beneath her. It had turned black. 
&quot;Where is everyone else?&quot; Saturn looked away.
        &quot;Dead,&quot;
        &quot;My mother? On the Moon?&quot; Saturn put her hand gently to the Queen&#39;s face 
and moved the tear that glistened there away. She nodded.
        &quot;No... oh heavens...no....&quot; Saturn looked around. Black clouds filled the 
sky once more, and the Earth rumbled in anger.
        &quot;Small Lady...this kingdom is no more. You have saved the universe once 
more, but it is not permanent.&quot;
        &quot;You returned....your sight... the appearance of Saturn means...&quot;
        &quot;The death of the world. You remember your lore well, Small Lady.&quot;
        &quot;Isn&#39;t there something we can do?&quot;
        &quot;Save the world, and we release Chaos.&quot;
        &quot;Won&#39;t destroying it be the same?&quot;
        &quot;They are binded, Small Lady. For the first time ever, they have been 
binded. The power of the ancient sword is great. They say it was forged in the 
seas of beginings. To the death of this world, to the death of them. Yes, they 
will grow again. But this time, it will be more... permanent. In the seas of 
beginning, there will be new star seeds, which take Millenniums to create, and 
these star seeds will be named Cosmos and Chaos. But for now, to the end of 
this world, there may be peace.&quot;
        &quot;Tell me, Hotaru. Please. Did you know that this...this,&quot; she said, 
pointing, &quot;Would be the outcome?&quot;
        &quot;This is every outcome, eventually. Everything happens. Every world, 
every soul will have its trial. Most die in it. But in this, we keep Chaos at 
bay, until the end of the universe.&quot;
        &quot;What choice is there to make?&quot;
        &quot;You made the seal. You must choose to break it.&quot;  Saturn lowered the 
Silence Glaive to the gray shards of stone scattered across the sands of what 
had once been Lady Serenity&#39;s kingdom. Glowing purple, they reformed into the 
blade. Serenity picked up the sword and drove it into the earth.
        &quot;On this sword, by my mothers guardians and by my name and power as the 
Queen Serenity of Tokyo, I...&quot; She looked at Saturn. &quot;I...&quot; she paused, crying. 
&quot;How can I ask for a world to end?! How can I ask everything to end? For me? 
For others?&quot;
        &quot;There is no other to die on this Earth, Serenity. Everyone but you is 
already dead. As for asking for the end of the world...In this case...how can 
you not?&quot;
        &quot;I entrust this blade and earth to its final destruction of destroy the 
heart of Chaos and Cosmos.&quot; Saturn nodded as Lady Serenity made her final 
decision.


        Lady Serenity had a few minutes to talk to the soldier of destruction, and 
she had so many things to ask...to know. Too much to left unsaid.
        &quot;Hotaru...why didn&#39;t you come? Why could you not be there?&quot;
        &quot;I love you too much to let you leave this world with Chaos on it. To 
feel guilty for the destruction of every world in the solar system. This way, I 
still have the power to destroy this world, to doom Chaos. If I had stayed... I 
would not.&quot;
        &quot;Will I die here?&quot;
        &quot;If...if you choose. Life is made of choices, Small Lady. We make them to 
help ourselves or help others. It is our choices inn this life that make us 
who we are.&quot;
        &quot;What choice have I?&quot;
        &quot;If I named your choices, they would become mine. You must choose your 
own path, your own destiny.&quot;
        &quot;End this world, Hotaru. Sailor Saturn.&quot; Saturn nodded, now her eyes 
filled with tears. She did not even say the attack, just brought down the 
Glaive in  a clean `swish,&#39; guiding it to the earth, to the destruction. The 
Queen stepped closer to her, and clung to her shoulders. In her palm lay the 
ginzhuishou.
        &quot;Farewell, Small Lady. I....&quot;
        &quot;I know. Until we meet again, Hotaru. Until we meet again.&quot;


Saturn.

        Grey mists swirled around the planet of destruction, as barren as the 
earth that they had left. Sometimes, a purple lightning bolt would flash above, 
but other than that, it was silent. No life lived her, but in all the planet, 
everywhere, you could sense the spirit of another, waiting for some event that 
would signal her to return. After the destruction, Hotaru&#39;s spirit return to 
its sleep. But, in the world where spirits are all we are, the floating Saturn, 
silent, was not alone. Another waited for her awakening, when she could look 
into her eyes, the eyes of someone who she still knew, still loved, once more. 
She was carefully pulled into a set of arms, the small figure asleep on 
another&#39;s lap. The two odangos trailed behind the figure, holding the smaller 
one, watching carefully over the spirit of her friend. Knowing the unsaid words 
that drifted between them.
        &quot;I know, Hotaru. I know.&quot;
