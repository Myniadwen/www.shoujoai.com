<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 5 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>There was approximately 506,392 architects in the world. 100,000 
worked with the Princess of Mercury. It took only 3 days for them to 
draw up the blueprints for the Crystal Palace. (is that good or bad?) 
100 more worked on building Crystal Tokyo. All others were spread 
throughout the world. 

Ami estimated it would only take 2 to 4 months to complete the Palace. 
With 100,000 workers the job would be easy. After the Palace was built 
Endymion &amp; Serenity would finally marry and take their rightful 
thrones. Which made things easy on Terrestria. Who didn&#146;t want to be 
crowned herself until her older brother was. 

Terrestria&#146;s new designs were quickly reproduced in all sizes. Luckily 
her building had survived the meteor and she called back her 
employees. The civilians on Earth didn&#146;t seem too concerned that the 
other Princess&#146;s hadn&#146;t found male counterparts. The daughter of Gia 
soon found out that many suspected the Princess&#146;s different 
relationships.

Terrestria had once again come to Earth in her human guise &#145;Terri 
Shields&#146;, famous fashion designer. Checking on UN Productions. As she 
colored in a new design for an evening gown, she listened to her 
employee&#146;s chatter.

&#147; I feel so sorry for the other Princess&#146;s.&#148;

&#147; Why? They seem very happy.&#148;

&#147; Yes, but their soooo busy! They don&#146;t have time to find themselves a 
prince. Their Majesties haven&#146;t even rebuilt there own planets!&#148;

&#147; Dai, you are silly! Haven&#146;t you noticed they don&#146;t want men?&#148;

&#147; Not men?&#148;

&#147; Of course not men. Haven&#146;t you noticed that whenever they are in 
public they are split into pairs?&#148;

&#147; No, but I didn&#146;t think about it.&#148;

&#147; Dai you are so dense. Princess&#146;s Terrestria &amp; Rei are the cutest 
couple out of them!&#148;

&#147; Karen you observe to much. But I have noticed how close Princess 
Pluto and Venus are. Well I&#146;m no longer sad for them!&#148;

&#147; That&#146;s good.&#148;

Terri tuned out the two women as they started on talking about wedding 
gowns.

- Which I should start on for Serena. How did someone like Karen 
figure out Rei and I? Oh well, she did say we were the cutest.- Terri 
returned to her work with a smile thinking of her Firebird.

~ 4&frac12; months later~

The Crystal Palace was finished. Crystal Tokyo was the capital of the 
world and today Serenity and Endymion get married. They had started in 
late October, it was now half way through February. A beautiful winter 
day. 

The Senshi were in their matching royal gowns (ch.2 ppl). As brides 
maids were Ami, Lita, Mina, Terri, Setsuna, Amara, Michelle, &amp; Hotaru. 
Rei was the Maid of Honor. Andrew was clued in on all Senshi 
&#145;activities&#146; and asked to be Darien&#146;s Best Man, which he agreed too. 

Serena was lovely. Her gown had a straight neckline, showing her 
shoulders. An inch down the sleeves were small straight slits across. 
The skirt flared lightly around her. A sheen of gold over top it, 
splitting down the middle and training behind her. The veil was of the 
same gold material, held between her buns with white roses. 

The ceremony itself was gorgeous. Mina started to cry as one of her 
best friends said &#145; I do&#146;. Terrestria took over after that. When 
Serena was done kissing her new husband her veil was taken off. 
Terrestria blessed them and placed golden crowns on their heads. The 
newly married, now, Neo-King Endymion &amp; Neo-Queen Serenity turned to 
face their people. Smiling broadly, Terrestria announced them.

&#147; People of the Earth. As High Princess of Terrestrial, I give you 
your new leaders. Neo-King Endymion and Neo-Queen Serenity!&#148; Cheers 
erupted as the new King and Queen walked to their awaiting limo. 

In the next week Neo-Queen Serenity awakened the planets Mercury, 
Mars, Jupiter, &amp; Venus. The inner Princess&#146;s were announced Queens of 
their planets soon after. Princess Terrestria woke her own Senshi&#146;s 
planets, each also becoming Queen. Except for Saturn, who was still to 
young to be Queen, but would take an active role in ruling the outer 
planer. Artemis had agreed to govern with her. Then it was finally 
April. In eighteen days Terrestria would join the others as High Queen 
of Terrestrial. 

Her own coronation was different than the others. Terrestria was 
presented as Sailor Terrestrial. Her uniform melted away after that 
revealing the same gown she wore the first time she ever had dinner 
with the Senshi. (In Life Just Gets Better, ch.3) Then Terrestria&#146;s 
headdress was taken away. As her black diamond crown was set in place, 
her princess gown flickered. In it&#146;s place a black copy of Serenity&#146;s 
wedding gown covered her. The only difference was that there was no 
gold or silver sheen. Her symbol glowed then vanished. Turning the new 
Queen, Neo-Queen Serenity gave the familiar speech. 

&#147; Citizens of Terrestrial. As High Queen Serenity II, I give you the 
leader of your future. Her Majesty, High Queen Terrestria!&#148; The 
Terress&#146;s cheered for their long awaited Queen.

The Universe was happy and peaceful. Ruled by eleven fair people. Of 
course happiness only last so long. Another month later King Endymion 
started acting odd. His wife and sister noticed this. Plus how 
strangely hostile he was to the Queen of Mars. Only he knew what it 
was.

A/N: So I finally get to the beginning of the plot. Interesting how 
it&#146;s always Darien who screws up every bodies lives. Well I don&#146;t have 
much love for him anyways. See ya in chapter 6! Bye!</pre>
