<h1>Junketsu no Narcissism</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/daughterofmars.html">daughterofmars</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Comments: This is a drabble written for my girlfriend as a part 
of the Christmas Calendar of yuri drabbles I&#39;ve written for her since 
the 1st of December. Despite its shortness, I liked this too much to 
have it hidden away on LiveJournal, so I decided to post it here. It&#39;s 
nothing extraordinary, but I liked the feel of Michiru in it. I think I 
might have fallen in love with her... she&#39;s such a beautiful character. 
On another note, it&#39;s not betaed and since it&#39;s been a while since I 
last wrote in English there may be some grammatical mistakes in there. 
Feel free to point anything out to me, if you stumble across something. 
Takes place in the part of episode 110 when Michiru, pushing Haruka out 
of the way, takes the blow of Eugeal&#39;s flying door-like things.

Comments would warm my heart.

Junketsu no Narcissism

Pure Narcissism

&quot;URANUS!&quot;

.o.

My conclusion must be that love is, all in all, a very selfish emotion, 
and what I am about to do an equally selfish action... no matter how you 
put it.

This doesn&#39;t mean I regret or will rethink it.

.o.

Her heels echo between the walls as she breaks into a run. Pressing her 
hands against the taller woman&#39;s shoulders, she focuses all the strength 
she has on pressing forward... away... away... away...

.o.

Is this the end, I wonder...?

.o.

Dark magic flows through her system, tearing itself out through her skin 
to transform into tendrils of red clay-like material tying her body to 
the board, so tightly that even her heart seems to stop beating...she 
screams without meaning to... she has never feared pain, yet...

.o.

If, in my next life, I were given the same choice &#150; between sacrificing 
myself or watching Haruka die (leaving me behind) &#150; I would push her out 
of the way and take the blow myself all over again.

After all, I shall be the first to admit that I am a rather egoistic 
person.

.o.

The last thing she sees before the enchanted barrier throws her into 
total darkness is Uranus&#39; wide, desperate eyes... the same colour as the 
sky on a rainy day at the shore...

But alive...

.o.

The truth is, of course, that... a world without Haruka is hardly worth 
saving... I don&#39;t even think I&#39;d want to try... without Haruka...

I hope she&#39;s stronger than me... in this aspect...

.o.

&quot;NEPTUNE!&quot;

.o.

Don&#39;t worry, Haruka... I like your hands.</pre>
