<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“It’s raining.”</p>
<p>Staring blankly outside, I watched the transparent knives  intertwine and harmlessly charge the Earthen rock. A cool breeze then  swept across the landscape and feeling the sudden chill, my knees  instinctively bent up into my chest making an attempt to keep warm.  Perhaps leaving the room door open to watch the rain wasn’t such a  good idea. I bit back a chuckle; although the weather may be of some  concern to my health, it definitely wasn’t as hazardous to it as a  certain enraged, raven-haired miko would. As soon as I returned to  the shrine from today’s ‘adventure’ Rei almost freaked when she  saw I was soaking wet. Although she wasn’t that much better off; it  looked like she had been caught outside as well. Anyway, I swear…  her words are still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p><em>“Look at you!  You’re soaked to the bone!”</em></p>
<p>She really does have a  loud voice. But then again, it must be essential for all aspiring  singers I suppose. Against my will I felt myself grinning stupidly at  the remembrance. She really was angry… For a moment I thought she  would slap me; the anger she emitted was terrifying, more so than an  angry Hotaru, if one could imagine it. However, I did point out it  wasn’t entirely my fault, I mean, how was I supposed to know it was  going to rain? It had been a clear, sunny sky after all.</p>
<p><em>“But  you know I don’t watch television Rei and it <u>was</u> beautiful  weather all day before the unexpected downpour. You can’t really  hold that against me can you? …Umm…Rei?”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei’s mouth  was open as though she was about to say something else but stopped.  However I also noticed her accusing finger hadn’t lowered from my  face.</em></p>
<p><em>“Grr…Nevermind” The miko snapped. “You! Go get  take a warm shower, I don’t need you getting a cold!” She started  to push me down the wooden boardwalk towards the bathroom.</em></p>
<p><em>“And  why’s that?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What do you think?” She looked away  quickly as I turned to look down at her. “Yuuchiro won’t be able  to do all the chores by himself you know, and I can’t keep looking  after him.”</em></p>
<p><em>It might’ve been my imagination, but either  Rei was also coming down with a cold, or she was blushing. Denial…I  smirked.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey, what’s that look for?” She  demanded.</em></p>
<p><em>“Nothing Rei, nothing at all.” My grin widened.  Seeing this, the short tempered girl frowned suspiciously before she  shoved me into the bathroom with a tremendous force, causing me to  almost trip and fall. Wow, we were here already?</em></p>
<p><em>“Woah!”</em></p>
<p><em>“And  don’t forget to wash behind the ears!” She glared before slamming  the delicate door shut.</em></p>
<p>Well I did take a shower and even  washed behind the ears; getting on Rei’s bad side isn’t a great  idea, which I learned quickly enough. My thoughts were interrupted  when a noise caused my ears to perk up. <strong>Tup, tup, tup,  tup.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Hmm?” What do we have here?</p>
<p>Out of the  corner of my eye I noticed someone walking along the elevated wooden  ledge that led around the shrine. Instantly I recognized the owner’s  scruffy hairstyle through the transparent, clear poncho. Yuuchiro  must be going out to check up on the plants I immediately concluded.  In an amused manner I studied the figure’s movements until he made  a quick left around the corner and disappeared from view into the  rain.</p>
<p>It was a bit of a surprise when I first learned that  ‘macho man’ had an interest in gardening. Just imagine all the  patience needed- planting the seed, watering it, making sure it  receives light and tending to it constantly…Even if it means going  out in this weather! I really can’t imagine myself picking up such  a habit. But…I sighed in exasperation. Hopefully that baka won’t  catch a cold over this. Sure, he may clumsy, loudmouthed and a hot  head at times, but there’s no doubt he has a good heart. Perhaps  Rei will come to appreciate it someday.</p>
<p>Oh, speaking of  which…</p>
<p>“Ahh! Wait, the plants!” I heard a familiar voice  cry -oh, she caught him.</p>
<p>“I CAN’T BELIEVE  IT! First Kaiya and now you too! You two will be the death of me, I  swear!”</p>
<p>“B-But Rei!”</p>
<p>“No buts! You are coming  with me this instant! Oh, stop that whimpering, it’s not manly you  know.”</p>
<p>My heart went out to Yuuchiro as I saw him being  dragged back to the shrine by the hood of his coat. Now that’s  gotta hurt, I cringed. It was short lived though; Yuuchiro’s  protests slowly died away, being replaced with the sound of falling  rain. Once reassured the balance had been restored, I relaxed into  another neutral mood and watched the unchanging scenery again.</p>
<p>Unconsciously my gaze came across one of the large, growing  puddle. My interest had been captured instantly as I watched almost  mesmerized at the reflected portion of outdoor scenery within its  shimmering surface. The illusion depicted our dormant sakura trees  twitching almost violently. Beautiful but somehow sad…What little  leaves remained were unmercifully battered without rest, some were  even ripped from their perches. Nature can be so cruel sometimes…</p>
<p>A  yawn had escaped me before I realized my eyelids had drooped down to  half closed position. There really wasn’t much left to do, not that  I could remember anyway. I looked back into the room over my shoulder  towards the only desk drawer. Then again, I suppose I could always do  another journal entry but I’m tired as all hell. Sleep looked good  about now.</p>
<p>“Ah…screw it.” I grumbled, whilst closing the  sliding door. Still being ultimately cautious of disturbing anyone my  fingers gently completed the task without any noticeable sound.  Seconds following up the futon was set up at the back of the room,  away from the cool atmosphere where I had shuffled under soft  welcoming sheets. Almost immediately the numbness in my limbs started  to ebb away, leaving a cool, tingling sensation. I hadn’t even  noticed that little detail until now either. Nevertheless, it felt  good, to be embraced in warmth.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and let it  all take me, reliving that moment with Uranus and Neptune earlier  today. Strangely enough I wasn’t feeling cold to the core at the  thought of their presence. It was…different somehow.</p>
<p>No  matter… if it comes down to it, I will finish it without doubt.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, at her house</u></p>
<p>“Wow, it sure  came out of nowhere didn’t it Michi?” Haruka mused.</p>
<p>I  knew she was talking about the sudden downpour and I had to admit, I  had been caught off guard as well. Normally I could sense these  things! What was wrong with me? I shook my head slightly. Perhaps  today’s stress had sent a few of my senses out of whack.  Nevertheless, Haruka and I needed shelter, so without arguing we both  decided unanimously that my place was closer.</p>
<p>“Michi? Are  you listening?”</p>
<p>“Yes Ruka.” I assured the impatient  blonde. She must be feeling so cooped up right now. Then she’ll…</p>
<p>“Do  you need some help with those?”</p>
<p>“Only if you’re sure…”</p>
<p>Haruka strolled over to my side and in a matter of seconds,  left with two plant pots, one clutched in each hand and carried them  to the kitchen table. I smiled weakly as I watched the blonde finish  the chore with ease.</p>
<p>“Arigato Ruka.” I thanked her  quietly.</p>
<p>“No problem, don’t mention it.”</p>
<p>Sometimes  I felt so guilty, so weak for relying on Ruka so much. It’s not  supposed to be this way, but…I can’t help it. Why does it make me  feel so bad, why does it feel so wrong? The question burned inside of  my being as if a muted voice were screaming at the top of its lungs.  To want to be stronger, to pull my own share in all the obstacles  that inevitably await Ruka and I in the future. That’s the reason  isn’t it? Then surely bringing the plants inside the house should  be a simple enough task. And yet…</p>
<p>Turning my back to Ruka’s  I tended to one of the pots I brought in myself, where I found an  unpleasant surprise. What’s this? All the other seeds have already  sprouted but this one… Bending down slightly for a better look,  cautiously I brushed the surface of damp grains, looking, feeling for  any sort of progress whilst hoping Ruka would not notice. Ever once  in awhile my eyes darted to make sure the other woman’s attention  was distracted.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>What’s wrong with it? I  pondered. Did I not water it enough? Give it enough light? I found  myself softly biting my bottom lip with worry. If Ruka found  out…</p>
<p>“Hey, how’s it doing?”</p>
<p>I froze for a  split second but found enough strength to weakly whisper her  name,</p>
<p>“Ruka…” I moved over reluctantly, allowing the  taller woman to gather herself at my side.</p>
<p>Haruka studied the  pot of dirt with a critical eye. Her bright green eyes seemed to dim  slightly at the sight. As she did so, her forlorn expression tore me  up inside. It was the one we planted together…I remember how  enthusiastic she was when we first agreed to it.</p>
<p><u>Thinking  back</u></p>
<p><em>“You’re really good at growing flowers  Michi.”Ruka said as she scratched the back of her head.</em></p>
<p><em>We  came to my house straight from school that day so I could tend to the  plants; they need water frequently on these hot days. The two of us  had also changed out of the uncomfortable school uniforms into more  casual, comfy wear, to take advantage of the sunny weather.</em></p>
<p><em>“Why  thank you Ruka. It’s not that hard actually…”I looked up from  the plant I was watering, rewarding her comment with a smile. The  shift in weight reminded me that my legs were beginning to cramp  slightly at the odd position. With that, I began to straighten up  from my kneeling position. Haruka was kind enough to back up a few  steps and give more space.</em></p>
<p><em>“What? Are you serious?” She  shot me a suspicious look as I proceeded to brush the dirt off of my  jeans and blue blouse. “You have to water them everyday, makes sure  they get a lot of sunlight and have some super inhuman patience not  to give up on them.”</em></p>
<p><em>There was a short pause of silence. Her  words slowly seeped in, leaving me slightly speechless for once. So  instead of a verbal response she expected, I did the next best thing  and broke out into a giggle.</em></p>
<p><em>“W-What’s so funny?” Ruka  attempted to frown.</em></p>
<p><em>“You make is sound like absolute  torture.” I giggled again as the blonde’s face betrayed her  embarrassment. She looked so cute. After quickly calming down and  regaining my composure I watched serenely as the sunlight bounced off  of Haruka’s favorite white shirt and yellow slacks. Sometimes, I  think she needs to relax. She just seems to uptight lately. Maybe…I  know!</em></p>
<p><em>In sudden inspiration I asked my companion, “Want to  give it a go?”</em></p>
<p><em>The shocked look of horror that plastered  itself on her face implied an immediate ‘no’.</em></p>
<p><em>“You mean,  me…GARDENING? Tell me you’re joking.”</em></p>
<p><em>I merely shook my  head, then watched her reaction with an amused expression.</em></p>
<p><em>“You’ve  got to be kidding, you know I’m not good at that sort of thing!”  She argued back.</em></p>
<p><em>“Have you ever tried?” I leaned in,  making her lean back.</em></p>
<p><em>“Well…no.”</em></p>
<p><em>“So how would  you know whether it’s your thing or not?” Haruka suddenly looked  away and I knew immediately I had said something wrong. “Haruka…I-I’m  sorry, I shouldn’t…”</em></p>
<p><em>“No, you’re right Michi. I  should be sorry.” The blonde forced a weak smile.  “It’s….”<br />
  </em><br />
  “…”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p><em>“It’ll  be alright Ruka, I’ll help you. We can plant one  together.”</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka seemed to hesitate at first but then  nodded.</em></p>
<p><u>Back to reality</u></p>
<p>We had briefly  went over the basics of gardening and then spent the rest of that  afternoon picking out a pot and seed type from the local farmers  market. I remember that part but…But why does it feel like I’m  forgetting something?</p>
<p><em>“No, you’re right Michi. I  should be sorry. It’s….”</em></p>
<p>What did she say after  that?</p>
<p>What did she say? The question echoed in my mind. Why  can’t I remember? It was…something important, I know it was!  But…what? It was as though reality had ripped me from a pleasant  dream. I leaned against the table for support, feeling my forearms  tremble slightly under clammy palms. I usually don’t forget things,  or more importantly, nothing important. This isn’t like me at all,  I inwardly groaned. Okay, stay calm; I’m sure it’ll come back to  me in time. It could be that I’m too tired to think clearly. I  mean, after a day like today who wouldn’t be?</p>
<p>“I should’ve  left it to you…I told you I wasn’t good at this stuff.” Haruka  broke the silence.</p>
<p>Upon hearing her distressed voice all  other thought went out the window into the rain.</p>
<p>“Don’t  say that Ruka.” I tried to re-assure her. “Sometimes…it takes  others more time to bloom. Think of it this way, plants are like  people; they need love and friendship to grow and  mature.”</p>
<p>“Plants…people…” Ruka shook her head with a  pained expression. “I don’t really care about that. I just…”</p>
<p>My  hand reached out to touch her cheek, silencing her words. The taller  woman didn’t flinch from the contact and didn’t pull back, but  allowed it to continue.</p>
<p>You don’t mean that…You’re just  disappointed.</p>
<p>“…Want to see it grow, I know.” When she  did not respond my hand moved down to take her’s in mine, embracing  warmth with the contact.</p>
<p>We had been standing for some time  now and I was sure our legs were becoming stiff, so I walked us over  to sit down on a one of the couches in the living room. Sitting down  felt so good, I found myself thinking as I leaned back into soft  leather with Ruka beside me. I glanced over to the blonde. Ruka must  have been thinking the same thing; she seemed to let out a soft,  contented sigh as we sat there. For awhile, none of us said anything,  only allowing our weary bodies to bathe in the silent darkness of the  room. However, during the time I noticed the blonde hadn’t bothered  to let go of my hand. Then again, I had no desire to point it out  either. It felt nice to know someone was there with you.</p>
<p>“Michi…?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“You  know…about the people and plants…I didn’t mean…”</p>
<p>“It’s  alright, I understand. “ I paused. “It’ll work out, we just  have to be patient.”</p>
<p>Ruka gently squeezed  of my hand. Her silent approval prompted me to change the subject to  something we could talk casually about. I don’t think either of us  wanted to talk abouttoday’s events quite yet.</p>
<p>“You  know, you and Kaiya have a lot in common.”</p>
<p>“What?” The  wind senshi remarked in shock. Seems she has found her voice again, I  thought to myself. “No way, we’re nothing alike!” Although I  couldn’t see her face, Ruka’s voice betrayed the laughter that  laced those words. In turn, I found myself smiling despite my  weariness.</p>
<p>“Yes you are.” I teased. “A pair of stubborn  mules. Are you sure you two aren’t related?”</p>
<p>“Michi,  such language!” Haruka laughed out-loud, her voice echoed through  the room. It sounds so good to hear her laugh again. “I do believe  Kaiya is starting to rub off on you-the little brat.” She quickly  added.</p>
<p>“Could be.” I sighed. But is that really a bad  thing?</p>
<p>It wasn’t just me though. Whether Haruka’s noticed  it or not, she’s changed a little as well; she smiles a lot more,  laughs more and makes jokes a lot while picking on the smaller  blonde. It used to be so different. Ruka rarely expresses any sort of  affectionate emotion to supposed strangers and so, it was a pleasant  surprise when the two hit it off. In fact, right now you could  probably mistake the ‘two stubborn mules ‘ as siblings; always  expressing their friendship through bickering.</p>
<p>Ruka suddenly  sighed, almost in longing.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” My companion  seemed to ponder the question, carefully choosing the right words to  express her issue.</p>
<p>“Remember before we even met Kaiya? You  said you had a vision…is Kaiya really a target?” The last portion  was barely audible.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” The discussion  was taking a serious turn. I suppose I should’ve seen this coming.  The ambiance tensed up immediately- pure hearts, saving the world and  the one word of burden, chaining us to our fate, ‘duty’. “I’m  pretty sure it was her.” I finally responded quietly.</p>
<p>I  squeezed Ruka’s hand, unconsciously looking for the comfort that I  was wrong.</p>
<p>“I mean, there hasn’t been any sort of  indication… and it’s been awhile and nothing, so isn’t it all  right? She won’t be attacked now right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t  know…” Just what were the chances that our friend would be  targeted now if not already? Maybe…It was a false vision. I  wouldn’t mind being wrong this one time. “Ruka, if Kaiya was  targeted and she did have the talisman…what would you do?”</p>
<p>My  companion remained silent, leaving me to my own doubting thoughts. Of  course, what sane person would answer that so quickly? Speaking of  which… what would I do if it came to it? It’s unavoidable to stop  the deadly silence without those specific three lives. All three and  only those three are the required sacrifices. No substitutes, no  exceptions. Could we really let one go and sacrifice millions as a  result of our selfishness? With my eyes closed I could still see  Kaiya arguing with Ruka, Kaiya looking embarrassed in her dress  clothes, Kaiya painting by the window at school…I should be able to  say ‘no’ without hesitation but…it hurts. It was then in my  faltering commitment that I couldn’t find the resolution to say  ‘yes, I can do it’. I need more time to get over this…</p>
<p>“Right  now, let’s not worry about it,” Ruka finally replied, “we  shouldn’t get depressed over something that could be nothing. Take  things as they come.”</p>
<p>“…You’re right.” The logic  made me feel a sense of false ease. Worrying about it now wouldn’t  help but it will come back eventually. In a sudden moment of weakness  I leaned against the taller woman’s side, allowing my head to rest  against her shoulder. Ruka tensed at first under the sudden new  weight but relaxed once her body adjusted to the change. She must  really be beat, poor Ruka. Then a new thought struck me. “But what  about our new ally? They seem dead serious about their sense of  ‘duty’. Even if for a good cause, the way they’re being cold  and distant makes the whole job seem criminal.”</p>
<p>“We really  don’t need their help, you know.” Ruka’s voice grew determined.  “We’re strong, I’m sure we can get through this together, with  or without our new ally.”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>Our  new ‘friend’ is unquestionably strong, but trustworthy? I don’t  know, only recently teaming up with this character. I just get a  weird feeling around that person, something about them makes me feel  uneasy. It’s hard to pin point the exact reasoning behind it…It’s  something familiar but with a double edge, almost as though one is  dancing with death itself. Cold and distant, all those times it felt  like they were looking down at me as inferior and I hated it.  Thinking of it always makes my blood boil. I mean Michi and I could  do this by ourselves, which is the way it’s supposed to be; we  don’t need the inner senshi or some mysterious stranger for help.  But how can I prove it?</p>
<p>“You’re still sure we can trust  this stranger Michi?”</p>
<p>“Yes Ruka.” She mumbled. The aqua  goddess seemed so distant in the response, she’s falling asleep I  realized.</p>
<p>We can talk about this later.</p>
<p>“Oyasumi  nasai Michi.” I whispered to the drowsy girl while wrapping one arm  around her shoulders, bringing her closer. She mumbled something that  I couldn’t make out, probably dreaming already. I smiled at the  thought; I wonder what she’s dreaming about?</p>
<p>“I don’t  need…your help.”</p>
<p>I could still see the other blonde’s  back turned to me as my vision faded out. The rain…I still could  hear it.</p>
<p><u>Mid Afternoon, next day</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Aww, I  knew I should’ve studied harder!” I groaned. A red, circled mark  of 82 stared up mockingly from my test page. Great, now I’ll never  hear the end of it! Slowly my gaze moved from the page to my side  where Kaiya and Michiru were chatting up a storm. ‘Storm’…The  word made me twitch in irritation. Chasing a very appearance  conscience youma yesterday really tired me out. I was planning on  getting up early this morning and squeeze in some extra studying time  too but was thwarted by the condition of ‘sleeping in’.</p>
<p>“Gee,  that’s too bad Haruka.” Kaiya peeked over my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey!”  I pulled the paper out of her view to my other side, unknowingly  shoving it into Michi’s face.</p>
<p>“Oh. It’s not that bad  Ruka.” One of the smartest girls in school casually assured  me.</p>
<p>Unable to make a snappy comment I merely dropped the  paper down for another quick peek, hoping the number would magically  change. I was disappointed again. Wouldn’t it be great if you could  use your powers to change test marks? Yes, using a world shaking and  disintegrating the paper to a pile of ashes was very appealing right  now.</p>
<p>“Hmm…Yeah, it’s okay I guess.” I finally conceded  half heartily.</p>
<p>“Are you kidding me?” Kaiya  teased.</p>
<p>“Okay, so what did <strong>you</strong> get smart ass!”</p>
<p>The  shorter blonde closed her eyes and cleared her throat, as if trying  to dramatically draw out the ‘suspense’.</p>
<p>“Ninety-six.”  She must’ve seen the shocked look on my face because she added,  “Oh, but don’t worry; Michiru beat me and aced the exam.” Won’t  the torture stop! I silently begged. If I were a brick wall I’d say  I would be crumbling into rubble right about now.</p>
<p>“Whatever…”  I crumpled the fragile sheet into a ball and stuffed it into my  school bag.</p>
<p>“Where are you going Ruka?” I heard Michi  call behind my quickened paced steps.</p>
<p>“The library, to  s-t-u-d-y.” I turned to face the ‘intelligent’ pair. To my  indignation their faces were frozen in a state of shock. “Hey now!”  A blush crept across my face as I strained to hear their apologies  through broken laughter.</p>
<p>“S-sorry  but…haha.”</p>
<p>“R-really?”</p>
<p>Fuming I turned on the  spot and left my two ‘best friends’ to enjoy their inside joke.  Working my way through the crowd I couldn’t help but thinking, ‘who  needs school’ and ‘one exam mark means nothing’. It wasn’t a  bad mark at all, could be easily made up. Besides, I shouldn’t be  worrying about this right now, I shook my head. It’s in two days, I  have to get prepared. That means training and…The test mark floated  through my mind again.</p>
<p>“Go away!” I snarled, swatting the  air in front of me.</p>
<p>At that moment someone walked out from  around the corner and cried “Oof!”</p>
<p><strong>Whap! Thud.</strong></p>
<p>My  palm was tingling where I struck the person. Oh shit, did I just hit  someone just now? Although I was clearly staring at the person on the  ground the thought didn’t quite register until now.</p>
<p>“I-I  didn’t mean to…Are you alright?” Damn, why can’t I just say  sorry?</p>
<p>The small girl meekly nodded. When she returned a  gaze I found myself staring into a pair of deep, dark eyes.</p>
<p>Our  school uniform?</p>
<p>“Look, I really didn’t mean to, uhh, knock  you over.” I bent down and picked up the things she had dropped.</p>
<p>“…” She merely nodded in what I assumed to be  understanding. I handed her a few books and pencil, taking her  appearance in unconsciously. Dark hair, eyes, pale complexion and our  school uniform…But, there’s this weird feeling about her I can’t  shake. Does she really go to our school? Couldn’t be high school,  although, I suppose it wasn’t impossible since the younger grades  were stationed on the lower levels. But still…Why does she look so  pale? It’s almost sickly…</p>
<p>“You can talk can’t you?”  When she did not respond I my patience slowly fading. Maybe I should  just leave- why was I still here anyway? I asked myself. Not too far  away I could hear motor vehicles honking down the street at a red  light. But was it that something told me not to go? My train of  thought was broken when the presumably younger student started to  tremble, progressively taking quicker breaths. Kami did I hit her  that hard? I felt my eyes widen. “Are you okay?” I asked again,  reaching out my hand.</p>
<p>“Don’t…” Came a whimper.  “…Get…close…”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to hurt yo-  Ugh!”</p>
<p>A shock of negative energy suddenly gripped my  outstretched limb inches from her face. What the hell? I cursed,  trying to keep from yelling outright. The blast had caused a surge of  burning pain shooting up to my elbow. I couldn’t stop twitching I  realized; it was as though the nerves had been shot.</p>
<p>“What  are you…?” My words came out cold and hard. I stepped back  instinctively when the gravity of dark energy began to build  exponentially around the human form. Her eye color changed as they  were now emitting a distinct sinister red. What is she, another youma  in disguise? The possibility hit me hard, remembering yesterday’s  incident. I ground my teeth in frustration; there’s no way I can  transform out in the open! So many damn people, someone might get  killed in the crossfire. I stood frozen, unable to decide what do to.  But whatever it was, I had to do it fast! The extreme power radiating  from this ‘girl’ is incredible, larger than anything I’ve ever  encountered. Worse of all, it was <em>still</em> growing. In the swirl  of thoughts, another had struck me, ‘<strong>I</strong> could be  killed’.</p>
<p>“Haaaaaruka!”</p>
<p>I spun on the spot  towards the energetic voice. Kaiya?</p>
<p>“Stay back!” I  shouted. There was a crackling noise from my backside, had the energy  accumulated this much already? Now I was truly torn, choosing to  transform or possible death. “Kaiya you idiot, I said stay where  you are!”</p>
<p>“Kaiya…?” A barely audible whisper hung in  the wind but I ignored it, probably my imagination created by  fear.</p>
<p>“Why?” Kaiya blinked back a look of confusion. Just  when I was about to leap forward and drag the other blonde away from  the area she remarked, “Oh, nice to see you again Hotaru.”</p>
<p>“Hotaru…?” I mouthed, stopping in my tracks. Do they  know each other or something? I reluctantly turned sideways to allow  Kaiya to step up beside me. The energy…it’s fading away, I can  feel it. However… my arm remembers. I definitely did not imagine  that. With my other hand I squeezed the inflicted flesh under the  cloth to find it still hadn’t recovered yet even with my senshi  powers. Shimatta, it’s practically numb! Whatever she did to me  wasn’t giving me good vibes; if I had actually touched this  ‘Hotaru’ my arm might’ve been shredded up into a pile of mush  or something worse.</p>
<p>“Umm…It’s good to see you again.”  Hotaru gave a short bow to Kaiya.</p>
<p>“Jeez, no need to be so  formal.” Kaiya outstretched her hand towards Hotaru and messed up  her short, dark hair with a free hand. “Quite a coincidence you  happened to be around, I was planning on looking for you  actually.”</p>
<p>So she could touch her, I noted. And the negative  energy hasn’t jumped up or anything as far as I can tell. Does that  mean that girl’s power is some sort of defense mechanism or  something? No, that can’t be it; it was definitely negative energy.  That type could never be used for good.</p>
<p>“R-really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah,  why not? We’re friends aren’t we?” Kaiya smiled first before  being joined by Hotaru in the act.</p>
<p>Friends? I don’t get it,  when, how…?</p>
<p>“So…you guys are ‘friends’?” I  questioned. Pushing aside the uneasiness from the previous encounter  I stared down coldly into dark eyes again. They were essentially  blank, was she masking her killer instinct? This doesn’t make any  sense at all! I raged inwardly. Someone that young couldn’t  possibly harbor such self control. That is, <em>if</em> she’s really  human.</p>
<p>“Mhmm, we met about awhile ago, shortly after I  ‘moved’ here.” Kaiya tried to explain.</p>
<p>“That so?”</p>
<p>So  basically they’ve only known each other for a few short weeks.  Good, this might make things easier. It would be harder if they were  childhood friends or related in some way.</p>
<p>“Look, you  shouldn’t hang around that girl.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean  Haruka?”</p>
<p>Two pairs of confused expressions stared blankly  at me. Kaiya’s however was turning to one of impatience.</p>
<p>“If  this is a joke, it sure isn’t funny.”</p>
<p>“It’s no  joke.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“ Come on, we should be going.”  I made to grab my friend’s arm.</p>
<p>“Hey! What has gotten into  you!” She yanked her arm away from me. Hotaru stood behind Kaiya,  nervously watching the events that were unfolding.</p>
<p>Over and  over I reminded myself Kaiya didn’t know anything, nothing about  youma, sailor scouts, nothing. Knowing her, she wouldn’t buy the  idea that her friend possibly was some toy of the death busters or  her life may be on the line by just hanging out with the presence.  Then again, what normal person would? I spat out the first complete  sentence that came to mind,</p>
<p>“It’s for your own  good.”</p>
<p>Okay, maybe it wasn’t the best answer explanation  but it was the absolute truth. However, a gut feeling told me I had  said the wrong thing as soon as the words left my mouth.</p>
<p>“Listen.”  Kaiya’s rebellious eyes trained their sights on me, sending a chill  down my spine. Where had I felt this feeling before? “I choose who  my friends are, not you. Last I checked you were my friend as well,  not my mother. Besides, you don’t know her.”</p>
<p>“I don’t  have to.” I snapped back.</p>
<p>“Why’s that? Because you think  you know everything? I’m sure that showed up in today’s  test.”</p>
<p>“What?” That was a low blow.</p>
<p>“Besides,  Hotaru is a nice person, if you’d give her a chance-,”</p>
<p>“But  she’s not normal!” I blurted.</p>
<p>There, I had said it. No  one moved or made an attempt to scream at the other’s face. In  truth, I half expected the smaller blonde to hit me; the anger  apparent on her face looked murderous. Both of us were now gasping  for some air, the debate had taken a toll on both parties but I was  more concerned with what would happen next. Would Kaiya  listen?</p>
<p>“Haruka…” She started and to my surprise, turned  her back to me. No… “Michiru asked me to remind you about our  shopping plan later, apparently she wants to pick up some cosmetics.  Would you tell her that I’ll take a pass this time?” Speechless I  watched Kaiya take Hotaru’s small hand in hers as the dark haired  girl kept sending nervous glances between my blonde counterpart and  myself. “C’mon Hotaru.” Kaiya urged. And without turning to  look back she slowly added, “Good luck with your studying  Haruka.”</p>
<p>Was she disappointed of me? A sinking feeling was  making me sick to my stomach. No, I’m not her mother, but that  doesn’t mean I can’t be worried about her right?</p>
<p>“Fine,  be that way!”</p>
<p>You idiot…</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>I  was fuming to the point of furious. What did Haruka mean that Hotaru  wasn’t ‘normal’? She couldn’t have known about Saturn’s  powers…in fact, now that I think about it, Saturn hasn’t made any  appearance that I was aware of since I came here. A thought then  occurred to me. Does that mean Hotaru hasn’t awakened yet? I turned  to look down at the smaller girl walking by my side. I don’t sense  anything from her…I frowned. Not abnormal anyway. If I didn’t  know her, I’d say she was just another ordinary looking person to  me.</p>
<p>“The park?” Hotaru quietly asked.</p>
<p>“Huh?”  My mind snapped back to reality to register the younger girl’s  question.</p>
<p>Somehow we had made our way to the park entrance. I  didn’t even until now.</p>
<p>“I guess so, is that alright with  you?” I tried to smile.</p>
<p>Hotaru merely nodded, her eyes  never leaving the ground. Why does she look embarrassed? Did I say  something wrong?</p>
<p>I pondered the thought as we wandered into  the spacious playground area, towards the very same place where the  two of us first met. Wow, its sure nice seeing the place in broad  daylight and right side up. And if I remember correctly, Michiru  often come here to paint. About what, I’m not sure. I felt my  eyebrows furrow slightly. She refuses to say, only that ‘it’s a  surprise’. Although… I do have a few guesses. Perhaps it’s the  small lake on the other side of that hill, the fluffy white clouds  floating aimlessly in the sky or the children interacting on the  playground. But then again, what if it wasn’t the scenery she was  painting? There was one other possibility I had in mind but…Hmm…I  wonder. Michiru better show me once its done like she promised, or I  might die from curiosity!</p>
<p>Ho-hum.</p>
<p>I kicked the clump of  sand at my feet. We’ve been sitting on this hot cement sidewalk for  awhile now and you know what? I’m bored!</p>
<p>“Hey Hotaru,  wanna go on the swings?” I jumped up and shouted  enthusiastically.</p>
<p>There was an odd flicker in Hotaru’s eyes  but it quickly faded.</p>
<p>“What do you say? It might be fun.”  I offered again. Jeez, it almost sounds like I’m making a sales  pitch.</p>
<p>Hotaru nodded, making a small sound of  agreement.</p>
<p>Taking her small hand in mine again, I laughed at  her response as we made our way to the swing set; the Hotaru I knew  wasn’t this shy. “I know you can talk.” I teased. With an  amused expression I watch the younger girl turn a bright shade of  pink. “You can say what’s on your mind you know… I’ll  listen!” I continued as we both took seats on the swing set. There  was another moment of silence following when I assumed that Hotaru  was trying to find the right words to express herself. It’ll come  to her, I told myself. Was it really that hard to come out and say  what was on her mind? I wonder what happened to her; most people  aren’t usually this shy without a reason. With one foot I began to  prod the leaps of sand once again, causing the tiny mountains to come  falling down. It’s like being mesmerized with the feeling of  power... or over imagination. Sometimes I wonder if a world shaking  was strong enough to make a real mountain collapse. Wouldn’t that  be neat to try someday? I shook my head. Nah, it wouldn’t be nearly  strong enough, or at least mine anyway…You’d need all of the  outer’s powers at least.</p>
<p>…Hmm, I wonder if Haruka is  still mad at me. Woah that thought came out of nowhere didn’t it?  But…I suppose what I said earlier was pretty cruel, now that I’ve  actually <em>stopped</em> to think about it. Still… she was the one  who started it. She shouldn’t have been so obnoxious, saying all  those things in front of Hotaru like that. How would she feel if  someone said that about her? Did she ever stop to think about that? I  sighed knowningly. No, knowing Haruka she probably spoke before she  thought. Sometimes I don’t get her, just what <em>is</em> going  through that head of her’s?</p>
<p>“You…didn’t have to do  that, back there.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?” Did Hotaru just say  something?. “Have to about what? Oh! You mean being your  friend?”</p>
<p>A sad look loomed over Hotaru’s features,  everything screamed sorrow, perhaps even despair.</p>
<p>“Look,  don’t worry about it, you’re a nice person. I want to spend time  with you, really!”</p>
<p>She turned to look at me. “How do you  know that?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s one of those things you feel but  can’t explain.” But a certain truth was my secret, I smiled.</p>
<p>“I  see…” She lowered her head. I thought she was just looking at the  ground at first, that was, until I heard the sobs.</p>
<p>Is  she…</p>
<p>“It’s alright, just let it all out.” I placed a  hand on her closest shoulder. Cry because you can. “Don’t let it  build up.” Hotaru sobbed harder with the gesture, softening my  facial features. Did you know, when you’re used to being on your  own with only yourself to count on…all the physical pain in the  world couldn’t produce the same tears that a simple act of kindness  could?</p>
<p><u>Some time later</u></p>
<p>It was awhile later  before Hotaru finally calmed down. The wait didn’t bother me in the  least; I’m sure she needed that, everyone has a weak moment one  time or another. However I <em>was</em> a becoming a bit concerned for  her health. Although I knew exactly how physically weak she was in  the future I had very little knowledge concerning her past condition  or conditions. Who knows what sort of illness she may have- she  always seems so pale in these days.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit warm out  isn’t it…?” Hotaru looked up. The look on her face indicated  that what I said was dawning on her. “I’m going to get us  something to drink, got any preferences?”</p>
<p>A shake of the  head, I’ll take that as a ‘no’ then.</p>
<p>“Great, I’ll be  right back as fast as I can. Wait here okay?” I ran off, hoping to  make a quick exit and return.</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tup,  tup.</strong></p>
<p>“Well, what do we have here, the  freak.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, shopping mall</u></p>
<p><u></u>I  wonder what’s taking Haruka and Kaiya so long, we agreed to meet  here at 4:00pm. If the mall’s clock is correct, then it really is  4:10pm. I can see Haruka being a few minutes late, maybe, but Kaiya  is always on time. For the fifth time in the last ten minutes my eyes  wandered through the crowds, filtering through the mass of faces as I  searched for my close friends. Have I been stood up? The flicker of  the thought was short lived; no, neither of them are like that. Then  maybe something happened? Haruka would call if there was a youma  attack…So that couldn’t be it.</p>
<p>“Ah!” I let out a soft  gasp.</p>
<p>Finally I spotted Haruka, the blonde had just turned the  corner and was heading over here. Instead of shouting unnecessarily I  waved calmly to the tall woman. I doubt she would hear me over this  crowd anyway.</p>
<p>“Hi…Is something wrong Ruka?” Was it just  me, or was there something different about her…?</p>
<p>“It’s  nothing.” The wind senshi brushed off the concern. “By the way,  Kaiya asked me to tell you that she’s taking a rain check on our  shopping plans.”</p>
<p>“Really? Did she say why?” The news  surprised me; it was rather sudden. What could’ve made her change  her mind so quickly after we spent all morning planning?</p>
<p>“Well…  not specifically, no.”</p>
<p>“Ruka… do you know why?” I  noticed the hesitation in her last statement. Unsurprised, I watched  the blonde nod her head slowly. Chalk one up for trusting gut  feelings, I silently noted. A thoughtful expression crossed Ruka’s  features shortly before her eyebrows furrowed in irritation. “What’re  you thinking about?”</p>
<p>“We got into a fight.”</p>
<p>“What?”  I felt my eyes widen.</p>
<p>“Nothing physical or anything like  that, we just… disagreed about something.” Ruka mumbled.</p>
<p>They  fought? I didn’t think Kaiya or Ruka would ever get into one of  those fights; ones that would put a serious strain on their  friendship. Sure the two blondes would get into little arguments here  and there, but it was often for fun and they’d shake it off as fast  as it started. Suddenly the reason why Kaiya decided not to come  clicked. Before I could say anything else, Ruka quickly  muttered,</p>
<p>“Can I tell you later?” How did she…? That  intuition of hers must be working overtime. I guess I should let it  go for now.</p>
<p>I nodded. It made me feel uncomfortable, the  whole situation was still very vague to me. I hope it isn’t that  serious…What could they have disagreed about? Quickly I stood up to  follow Ruka, who had decided to lead the way at that moment.</p>
<p>Oh  Ruka… I thought as I followed closely behind her, you knew this  could’ve happened from the beginning.</p>
<p><u>Cosmetic  store, empty aisle</u></p>
<p><u></u>“What do you think of this one  Ruka?”</p>
<p>“Looks good.” She mumbled.</p>
<p>Ignoring her  unenthusiastic reply I continued to apply the sample lipstick. Really  any color would’ve done at the moment because I was more interested  in watching the blonde through the compact mirror than my own lips.  You can really tell she’s trying hard to be nonchalant with the  entire issue, the way she’d roll her eyes for no reason, how she’d  sigh frequently, then frown…it’s driving me crazy! We both know  there’s something wrong. Come on, can’t you tell me Ruka?  Instantly a sense of shame washed over me; it’s not really any of  my business is it? It’s their fight…I suppose there’s a thing  of trying too hard to be helpful…</p>
<p>“I’ll take this one.”  I cheerfully decided. As I turned on the spot I added, “Want to  grab a bite to eat? There’s this place I know and the food is  great.”</p>
<p>The wind senshi looked thoughtful at the  suggestion.</p>
<p>“Sure, why not?” She shrugged. “I did miss  lunch today.” Haruka smiled. The moment was slightly ruined when  her stomach added in its two bits.</p>
<p>“I see…” Try as I  might, I couldn’t help but giggle at poor woman.</p>
<p>“Ah,  that was unintentional.” Ruka quickly explained.</p>
<p>“But it  was amusing nevertheless.” I teased.</p>
<p>Presumably at a loss  for words Haruka blushed, looking a tad bit flustered.</p>
<p>“Where’s  that restaurant?” She finally snapped out of her frozen state and  dashed past me.</p>
<p>“Well maybe if you slowed down I can show  you.” I turned to follow.</p>
<p>“What’s the name? I’m sure I  can find it myself.”</p>
<p>“Ruka…”</p>
<p><u>Finally at the  restaurant, Haruka’s POV, forty minutes later</u></p>
<p>She did  that on purpose, I know she did! I raised a glass filled with iced  water to my parched lips, still fuming over the wild goose chase  Michiru had lead us on. Okay, maybe it wasn’t exactly like that but  stopping at every store along the way was too excessive for my taste;  I detest spending hours upon hours hunting for a single piece of  garment. Unfortunately a certain party sitting across from me is in  love with this sort of stuff. With wearing patience I watched one of  her slender hand’s pull out a familiar object out of the pile of  purchases.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>“…” I scrunched my face up  at the mere thought. “No.”</p>
<p>“Who knows, maybe it’s your  color.”</p>
<p>“I don’t wear make-up.” I flatly stated the  obvious.</p>
<p>Michiru sighed and smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>“I  know but I was just curious.”</p>
<p>“Well I’m not. Give it to  Kai-“ I stopped and froze mid-sentence. Remembering the earlier  events I groaned inwardly. That’s right, Kaiya probably hates me  now.</p>
<p>“You were about to say Kaiya weren’t you?”</p>
<p>Refusing  to meet Michi’s stern gaze I stubbornly looked down at the  tablecloth; suddenly counting the square designs became very  appealing. Should I nod? Without another thought I made to dip my  head through the motion but was stopped when a cool hand found its  way under my chin, lifting my face up to see the expectant pair of  aqua eyes. After getting my undivided attention Michi asked  quietly,</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“I…You know, this  really isn’t a great place for it.” I swung my head towards the  crowded tables occupied by customers.</p>
<p>“They’re all busy,  no one will hear.”</p>
<p>“But Michi…” I almost whined.</p>
<p>Her  eyes searched mine, never breaking contact.</p>
<p>“It’s not a  regular argument is it?” I gulped, amazed at her sixth sense and  reluctantly nodded. To show her the exact reasoning behind it I  pulled up my shirtsleeve to reveal the inflicted area. Michi gasped  as the fabric peeled away, allowing the bright, red marks marring the  skin to be seen. They’ve healed somewhat, most of them have  closed…but the redness still lingered. Nothing that a good  transformation wouldn’t heal though. I almost recoiled back in pain  when my companion reached out and touched the marks; they still  burned, even the lightest pressure made me involuntarily twitch.  Seeing my pained reaction the ocean senshi apologetically  whispered,</p>
<p>“Gomen ne…”</p>
<p>“It’s alright.” I  reassured her while I allowed the fabric to slide back down. As it  did so I noted every burning spot that flared up where the fabric  rubbed against the irritated marks. It freaking hurts, I cursed,  taking in sharp breaths to hold back any rebellious outcry.</p>
<p>“Did  Kaiya…” Michi started, her voice weighed heavy with concern at  the possibility.</p>
<p>“No.” I shook my head. The aqua goddess  leaned back into her chair for a moment, looking somewhat relieved  but obviously confused. Her eyes darted across random objects,  calculating what may have happened. However, I decided to save her  the trouble.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t her, her ‘friend’ did it.”  Wait…Oh, shit!</p>
<p>“Friend?” Michiru echoed my words. “Huh?  Wait, where are you going Haruka?”</p>
<p>I shot up from my seat,  making to leave immediately, pausing only a minute to pull out my  wallet and inquire a nearby waiter for our bill.</p>
<p>“Never  mind.” I snapped at the shorter man. “Take this and keep the  change.”</p>
<p>“Haruka?” Michi was now standing as well.</p>
<p>“If  you want to know what happened then let’s go. I’ll tell you on  the way.”</p>
<p>Snatching up two fistfuls of shopping bags I  moved out of the establishment entrance, angrily tearing myself down  for letting it slip my mind. Baka, baka, BAKA! My mind screamed at  me. Why did I just leave Kaiya alone with that thing after I made all  that effort to avoid it? Who knows what could be happening right now-  is she okay? And wasn’t she a potential target…? No, no, no! Shut  up, nothing is going to happen.</p>
<p>I lengthened my strides  considerably.</p>
<p>“Haruka, slow down.”</p>
<p>“No time.”  Michiru didn’t protest back again.</p>
<p>Nothing is going to  happen because I’m going to be there! I was running now, faster,  stronger, following the wind.</p>
<p>“Come on Michi!”</p>
<p><u>Park,  Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>I can’t believe I had to go to five  different machines before I found one that actually worked! I sighed  to myself. That took forever, this old technology age really sucks  sometimes. Hopefully Hotaru isn’t bored out of her mind… who  knows, maybe she found someone to hang with while I was away. It is a  playground after all…</p>
<p>“Freak!”</p>
<p>“Don’t touch  me you monster!”</p>
<p>What going on? I dropped the drinks and  sprinted towards the shouts to find a group of middle school aged  kids surrounding a small body. Hotaru?</p>
<p>“Hey! Get away from  her!” I charged down towards the small group of kids, taking in all  their ugly mugs into precise consideration.</p>
<p>“W-What are you  doing trying to defend that monster?”</p>
<p>I looked down at the  spoiled brat. Obvious he was one of those pampered kids who go out  looking for trouble- in this case the ringleader of the group judging  from the other’s agreed nods.</p>
<p>“What did you do to her?”  I coldly glared.</p>
<p>Ignoring the question completely caught the  smaller youth off guard.</p>
<p>“Nothin-“</p>
<p>“Don’t give  me that crap! What did you do?” I half snarled, narrowing my eyes  to mere slits.</p>
<p>The boy backed away immediately, so fast that  he tripped over a crack in the uneven sidewalk. His followers  retreated back a few steps as well, their faces in complete shock.  What, was I that scary? If that were all they did I might’ve  believed it myself but when the blood drained from their faces I then  began to wonder.</p>
<p>“M-monster…” One of them whispered. The  word sparked me fuming again. Just as I made to berate them the  others screamed,</p>
<p>“Run for it!” And they scattered.</p>
<p>“Run  for it?” I repeated their words. Why did they…? I slowly made to  turn around. “Hotaru?”</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p>I spun on the  spot in time to see Hotaru collapse onto the cement.</p>
<p>“Hotaru!”  I ran to her. “Hey, are you alright? Talk to me!” I shook her  gently, hoping she would respond in some way to show she was  conscious. Taking my palm to her forehead I realized she was burning  up. This sun and that uniform, suddenly made sense. Why didn’t  loosen she her shirt collar if she was feeling too warm? Moving my  own hands down I made to loosen the unbelievably tight collar. As I  did so, I was thinking how those brats may have had something to do  with it as well. If I see them again…</p>
<p>“There, that should  do it.”</p>
<p>She might breath easier now. Hotaru  was still involuntarily gasping hard but it slowed a bit. Wait, what  am I doing sitting here? There’s no time for that, I’ve got to  get her to a doctor! Picking up her light form I threw her carefully  onto my back and started to run.</p>
<p>Hang in there Hotaru! I  silently begged. What do I do? Where do I go?</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>I  skidded to a stop. “You’re…Please I need a help, can you...”</p>
<p><u>Hospital, shortly later</u></p>
<p>“Will she be  okay?”</p>
<p>“They did a few tests and she seems perfectly fine  aside from a few bruises. It’s possible that she has a weaker body  than most people.” The blue-haired attendant flipped through some  pages on her clipboard. “The heat seems to be the main cause of her  collapse as far as we can tell…Give her some time to rest and cool  off and she’ll be on her feet in no time.”</p>
<p>“Arigato  Ami.”</p>
<p>The small blue eyed girl nodded, modestly accepting  the thanks. It was sheer luck that she happened to be walking home at  that moment, even more so that her mom is a doctor. I don’t know  what I would’ve done if she hadn’t shown up, I had no clue where  the nearest clinic or hospital was. No…Don’t think about what  could have happened, this is what happened, accept it and be glad.  But I couldn’t help thinking, was it just me, or is Hotaru weaker  here in this time than her future self? Attending all those official  meetings never worn her out nearly as much as standing out in the sun  for too long. Maybe it was something she just grew out of?</p>
<p>Ami  moved over to the I.V unit and checked the remaining volume. It still  looked pretty full to me. My eyes trailed the falling liquid from the  large bag, down the tube to Hotaru’s uncovered arm. I stared  particularly at the lengthy needle; I hated needles, the mere thought  of having the prickly things jab into my flesh sent shivers down my  spine. One time I remember this one time where it was mandatory for  all residents at the palace to be vaccinated for an unusual strain of  illness, some continually mutating virus. I also remember that I  would’ve preferred the illness over the needle but it wasn’t to  be; eventually the staff caught me. Taking down ten guards is the  record though.</p>
<p>“Remembering a happy memory?” Ami quietly  inquired. “You don’t have to tell me but you were smiling  so…”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I wouldn’t exactly call it happy…Merely  amusing.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yup.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>“Can  I ask you another thing Kaiya san?”</p>
<p>“Kaiya is fine.” I  replied without a thought.</p>
<p>“Oh…Umm, are you related this  girl?” Ami referred to the patient. “You really seemed frantic  when I bumped into you; and that sort of concern is virtually non  existent between strangers.”</p>
<p>I looked to Hotaru, then  towards Ami. It seemed like an innocent enough question. Her logic  made perfect sense and I found myself agreeing with it; perfect  strangers wouldn’t have been worrying themselves to death and if  you were judging by the age difference between Hotaru and myself, it  would be difficult to believe we were friends to begin with. Nothing  gets by this girl, perhaps something to watch out for in the future I  noted. For now I guess I should make this believable and play  along.</p>
<p>“ Sisters, but not related directly if you get  me.”</p>
<p>“I see…Nevertheless she’s lucky to have someone  watching over her.” Ami quietly finished.</p>
<p>“No siblings of  your own then?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Only my  mother and myself.” I noticed how she didn’t mention her father  but choose to let it pass.</p>
<p>“Must be hard…ever get lonely?”</p>
<p>“Sometimes…” The girl admitted. She looks so serious  doesn’t she ever relax? “My mother always spends late nights  working but I’m usually busy studying so I don’t notice.”  Liar…I thought. It’s in your eyes, you just want to believe that  don’t you? “I <em>have</em> thought about what it would be like to  have an older sibling who would protect me, be someone I could go to  for advice…That might’ve been nice. But then again, I wouldn’t  mind having a younger brother or sister to protect; having someone  lean on me for a change. Perhaps I wouldn’t be like this if things  were different, maybe I wouldn’t have become ‘study Ami’ who’s…  only good at… studying.”</p>
<p>Her last words were cut off by  the beginnings of tiny sobs. For a moment I was speechless; when I  meant relax I didn’t mean break down!</p>
<p>“Come on, your not  useless. I’m sure there are a lot of things you can do. Umm…for  starters, what <em>do</em> you like to do?” Ami began to open her  mouth and I quickly added, “Besides studying.”</p>
<p>“Besides  studying? I-I don’t…”</p>
<p>“There has to be something.  Let’s see, are you into fortune telling?”</p>
<p>Ami shook her  head.</p>
<p>“Dancing? No? How about…computer programming?”</p>
<p>“A  bit.”</p>
<p>“See? Not a lot of people can do that!”</p>
<p>“I  suppose…” She reluctantly agreed. Okay, there definitely has to  be something she <em>really</em> likes to do that doesn’t involve  studies!</p>
<p>“Do you do any sports? Anything to relax? I mean,  you can’t study all the time…And it must be stressful sometimes  right?”</p>
<p>There was a brief silence as Ami seemed to ponder  over something but hesitated to say outright. So there was another  detail she wasn’t revealing. Was she embarrassed about  it?</p>
<p>“It can’t be that bad. You can tell  me, I won’t laugh.”</p>
<p>“Swimming.” Did I just hear  right?</p>
<p>“Really? You can swim? That’s awesome!’</p>
<p>“D-do  you swim Kaiya?” She stammered, taken aback by my enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Me?  Nah, but sometimes I wish I could.” On quite a few occasions I  might add. “But you know, Michiru swims as well, you two should go  together or something, I’m sure you would become great  friends.”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, no, no.”</p>
<p>“You’ve already  met her?”</p>
<p>“It’s just…She’s …I can’t compare to  her at all.” Ami seemed to squirm in her chair.</p>
<p>“Michiru  won’t bite or anything …or at least as far as I know.” To my  delight Ami seemed to giggle for a split second before her will  clamped it down again. Feeling motivated I continued. “It’s in  your mind…Being good friends with someone doesn’t have to be  about equal status, same age or talents, it’s just being there for  another person with or without all that.” Haruka’s face flashed  before my eyes, her pained expression. I really should listen to my  own advice…</p>
<p>“Still…”</p>
<p>“I could introduce you  two and like you said before, you like to swim. Michiru is <em>obsessed</em> with the sport. You two already that much in common.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps…”  She started to sound cheerful again.</p>
<p>“Mm…?”</p>
<p>Ami  and I turned towards the muffled sound to see Hotaru starting to  regain consciousness.</p>
<p>“Don’t move too much, you still have  the I.V attached to you.” Ami quickly warned the drowsy  girl.</p>
<p>“What…Where…? Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Hey, good to see  you awake again.” I tried to keep my voice down for her sake, I’m  sure loud noises would only give her a headache since she <em>was</em> waking up. “How do you feel?”</p>
<p>“Tired…” She groaned.  “What happened?”</p>
<p>“You collapsed.” I quickly explained.  “The heat must’ve gotten to you. I’m really sorry that I didn’t  get you a cool drink sooner.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay…” Hotaru  sleepily mumbled. “It always happens to me, don’t worry about  it.”</p>
<p>“She’s right Kaiya, it wasn’t anyone’s fault.  And you did try to keep her cool…”</p>
<p>“But it wasn’t good  enough.” I almost replied bitterly.</p>
<p>For a few minutes no  one said anything, each person in her own world. That was before Ami  broke the silence.</p>
<p>“Kaiya, would you blame a doctor that  couldn’t save a patient from a severe wound? If they tried to do  everything possible but came up short in the end?”</p>
<p>“No, of  course not.” I automatically answered.</p>
<p>“Then why are you  blaming yourself so harshly? You’re only human. Bringing Hotaru to  the hospital was the most you could’ve done for her. She’s  alright now because of it.” She reasoned.</p>
<p>It slowly dawned  on me that the tables had been turned; now it was Ami giving me the  lecture. I knew I should’ve seen this coming! Don’t get me wrong,  I do understand what Ami was getting at but it still irritated me, I  wish I could’ve done more. It’s just…I didn’t want to hear  theses words right now.</p>
<p>“Sometimes the best you can do is to  prepare all you can and hope it’ll turn out in the end.” The  blue-haired girl continued. She looked down at her wrist to check her  watch and exclaimed, “Oh no, I have to get to my next shift. It was  nice meeting you Hotaru, I hope you get better soon. Nice talking to  you again Kaiya, perhaps we can chat again some other time.”</p>
<p>The  girl gave a slight bow and then exited the room. When all became  quiet other than the sound of Hotaru’s soft breathing I turned my  attention towards the sleepy girl once more.</p>
<p>“I’m really  sorry…”</p>
<p>Hotaru opened one eye slightly and seemed to  smile despite herself.</p>
<p>“I told…you…”</p>
<p>“Not  just for the drink, but for not being there when those bullies showed  up- although, I doubt they’d show their faces anytime soon…I’m  also sorry about what Haruka said earlier, I’m sure she didn’t  mean it; she doesn’t know what she’s talking about.”</p>
<p>“Hey,  please don’t start crying again, try to save your strength.”  Hotaru weakly nodded her head, attempting to swallow any vocal sound.  “I’ll be right here.” I squeezed her hand gently. Try to get  some sleep okay…?”</p>
<p>I waited for the next five minutes,  watching anxiously as her breathing slowed to normal. She’s…so  fragile. What… what if she becomes the next target? Would she be  able to survive such a violent attack?</p>
<p>I may not be able to  protect her from herself but…</p>
<p>“I’ve got to get  stronger.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, park area</u></p>
<p><strong>Huff!  Huff! Huff! Huff!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“And you let her go?” I shouted to  my partner. What were you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Huff! Huff!</strong></p>
<p>“It’s  not like I had any choice!”</p>
<p>Haruka leaped through some  grass into another pathway with me following close behind.</p>
<p>“Do  you have <em>any</em> idea where they went?” I inquired because  running around like chickens with their heads cut off wasn’t going  to do much good.</p>
<p>“Well, they headed in this general  direction, so I figured they came to the park. Its called intuition!”  She yelled back over her shoulder. “Besides, can’t you use that  sixth sense of yours to track them?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s…not a  radar you know.”</p>
<p>I was trying but I couldn’t pick up  anything. Or at least not yet. What I told Ruka was true. My power  doesn’t allow me the luxury of sensing where a certain person is at  this exact time; it tends to work around such settings. Picking up  past vibes, viewing into the future, even interpretations of another  person’s emotions to a certain extent was covered by what Ruka  refers to as my ‘sixth sense’.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>“Ruka! Wait  a second.” I had halted to a stop and focused my attention to a set  of swings. Something seemed familiar, the energy that  lingered.</p>
<p>“Find anything Michi?”</p>
<p>“Shh…” I  hushed her. Closing my eyes and taking slow, deep breaths I walked  into the center of energy. It was strong, whatever it was; it had to  be if it lingered in this area for this long. A good five hours at  best I’d say. Now let’s see…A dark, purple cloud… Someone  panicked. But, what’s this? I stepped forward, attempting to sort  through the mess. There’s something else here but I can’t see it.  I can sense it but…all I can see is this purple fog.</p>
<p>“Michi?  What is it?” Ruka whispered, keeping her voice low and out of  earshot of bystanders.</p>
<p>My eyes fluttered open and I blinked a  few times afterwards to clear my bleary vision.</p>
<p>“Something  happened, but I can’t say for sure <em>what</em>.” I replied in the  tone she had set.</p>
<p>Out of my peripheral vision I saw Ruka bite  her lower lip.</p>
<p>“Is…Is it bad?”</p>
<p>“Someone…panicked.  More than a few hours ago.” I added, careful to keep my voice  steady for both our sakes.</p>
<p>“So we have no clue at all then?  Argh!” In frustration the wind senshi pivoted on the spot and  punched one of the swing’s metal supporters.</p>
<p><strong>Ping!</strong></p>
<p>“Woah!  Didn’t that hurt mister?”</p>
<p>A girl of perhaps five years of  age ran up to an enraged Haruka out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“Ruka,  please calm down.” I tried to persuade the taller woman. “Hurting  yourself won’t make things better. I’m sure Kaiya’s okay, we  would know if <em>it</em> happened.”</p>
<p>“Who’s Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Look  kid, we don’t have time for this. Why don’t you go back and play  with your friends or something.” Ruka managed to make out calmly  enough.</p>
<p>To my surprise the youngster seems unaffected by the  blonde’s coldness, more or less driven by curiosity I’d  say.</p>
<p>“Hey mister, did you lose something?” The girl looked  sad as she said this or at least, she sounded sad.</p>
<p>“I don’t  know.” Ruka sighed exasperated. “Maybe…”</p>
<p>“That’s  too bad…Does your hand hurt?” I looked to Haruka’s hand to see  the knuckles still a bright red. “Maybe you should go see a  doctor.” The child continued. “Mommy says they’re supposed to  help you but then they make you eat yucky medicine.” She scrunched  up her face for emphasis. I could see her tiny mouth curl downward  into a thoughtful frown. Wow, the sun is sure bright… It would be  much easier to see her face if she weren’t standing directly in the  light. “Maybe they’ll make that other girl eat yucky medicine  too?”</p>
<p>“A friend of yours?” I finally spoke up for the  first time.</p>
<p>The girl shook her head. “…I heard someone  say they were going to take her to the  hospital.”</p>
<p>“The…hospital?”</p>
<p>“One of them had  pretty golden hair, maybe mine will be like that when I’m older?”  She jerked her thumb towards her own mid-back length hair and  smiled.</p>
<p>Ruka’s eyes widened in shock and instantly I knew  what was on her mind.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” I asked the  child again.</p>
<p>“I said, one of them had pretty golden  hair.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, that’s all we needed to know.” I  thanked her. “We got a lead Ruka, shall we go?”</p>
<p>My  partner nodded her head as she steeled herself with a cold demeanor.  Cold, determined eyes met my own. It could be really bad… but it’s  worse off not knowing, right Ruka? We left.</p>
<p>“Bye  mister...Let’s play again sometime.” She seemed to giggle, then  vanished with the wind.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, Hikawa  Shrine</u></p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!” I cried. “Come on! Why  won’t you work?”</p>
<p>I let my arms fall back to my sides  after holding them up for the countless attempts during the past  hour; they were starting to feel very heavy. This secluded training  ground was perfect but what good does it do if the training doesn’t  go well? Absolutely none!</p>
<p><strong>Huff…huff…</strong></p>
<p>One of  my free hands brushed off a trickle of sweat that had made its way  down a side temple.</p>
<p>“There must be something that I’m  doing wrong…But what?” Only the expected silence greeted me.  I…Hotaru’s face flashed past my eyes, have to get stronger! Not  just for her but for everyone; I don’t want to be the weak one to  drag <em>them</em> down either.</p>
<p>“Maybe…” Another idea  struck me. “World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>The expected bright ball of  energy came forth and I threw it into the ground like many times  before. It swirled, marking its path through untended grass and  overgrown weeds until it collided with a small bolder, shattering it  into a pile of useless rubble.</p>
<p><strong>Crackle!</strong></p>
<p>Now…</p>
<p>“Deep…”</p>
<p>Suddenly  the air around me became cold, an unfamiliar sensation was  approaching; I could feel it. Goosebumps started to form on my bare  forearms, causing me to shiver slightly. My eyesight was starting to  go bleary I realized and why…why was it getting harder to breath?</p>
<p><strong>Craaash…</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like crashing water…But  that can’t be right, I’m nowhere near the ocean! I tried to step  back but froze. When I looked down my heart beat sped up  exponentially.</p>
<p><strong>Luuuub duuuub! Luuub duuub! Luub duub! Lub  dub! Lub dub! Lub dub!</strong></p>
<p>Water…The only thing holding me  up was no longer the ground, but an enormous surface area of water.  It looked so real and felt so real…was it really here? Before  another thought could cross my mind it parts to two sides and shot  up, startling me.</p>
<p>“AHH!”</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p>There  was a soft thud as I fell to my knees. At that moment I felt  immensely relieved that it was soft grass that cushioned my fall and  not the watery abyss. I thought I was going to drown! There was so  much water…where did it all come from? Was that part of the deep  submerge? My hands trembled under me, shaking precariously.</p>
<p><em>“I…  have to get stronger!”</em></p>
<p>I think…I know the problem.  With that I trudged back towards the shrine, feeling determined more  than ever.</p>
<p>“Kaiya would you- Hey! What happened?”</p>
<p>“I  fell into some of the thorn bushes out back while attempting to weed.  Rei, can you phone Ami up for me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…” The miko  hesitated. “But why?”</p>
<p>“I wanted to ask her  something.”</p>
<p>Rei raised an eyebrow but asked no more  questions about it. We walked into the kitchen where she dialed the  number with memorized precision.</p>
<p>“Here.” She handed the  phone to me.</p>
<p>“Arigato.” As I listened to the line ring at  the other end I was well aware that the miko hadn’t moved from my  side. “Rei…”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright, I get it!” She  sighed. “I better go check up on Yuuchiro anyway.” She mumbled.  With that she exited the room into the sunlight outside. I know she’s  worried but realkly…</p>
<p><strong>Briiiing. Briiiing. Brii-</strong></p>
<p>“Hello?  Mizuno residence.”</p>
<p>“Ami? It’s Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“…Oh!  Is something wrong Kaiya?” Came the familiar voice. I wonder why  she said that?</p>
<p>“No, nothing’s wrong.” Although that  wasn’t entirely true, I gritted my teeth at the memory. “I walked  Hotaru home and she seems good as new like you predicted.”</p>
<p>“Really?  I’m glad to hear it.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Can  I ask you for a favor Ami? You said you can swim right?”</p>
<p>“That’s  right.” She seemed to make a noise of agreement from the other  end.</p>
<p>“Can you teach me how to swim?” I blurted.</p>
<p>“What?  Y-you’re asking me…for swimming lessons?” I could’ve sworn I  could hear the shock in her voice.</p>
<p>“Please?” I really  didn’t want to start begging. “If you don’t want to…”</p>
<p>“No!  I…I don’t mind at all. When’s best for you?”</p>
<p>“Umm…Anytime  is fine. But shouldn’t I be the one asking you that?”</p>
<p>“Well,  I was planning on going for a swim tonight…we can do it then if  that’s alright with you.”</p>
<p>Tonight? That’s perfect! For  a moment I thought I’d have to wait at least a few <em>days</em> before Ami would have the time.</p>
<p>“Yeah!” Oops, that was a  bit loud. “I mean, sounds great.”</p>
<p>“So we’ll  meet…”</p>
<p><u>Outside the sports center, late evening</u></p>
<p>My  eyes looked the large building up and down. Hmm…I don’t think  I’ve ever been to this place before, I wonder which floor the pool  is on? Ami said she’d meet me here but I don’t see her, I thought  as I looked around. Perhaps she’s already inside? Probably…I made  my way towards the door.</p>
<p><u>Inside, at the pool, Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p>“Are you sure you don’t want to join me?” Michi  called out. “Haruka, I know you can hear me.”</p>
<p>Yeah, I can  hear you, I thought to myself. I really didn’t feel like moving is  all; I only recently found a comfy position and it took forever. Do  you know how hard it is trying to sleep atop of a diving board  suspended half a floor up?</p>
<p>“No thanks, I’m good.” I  waved lazily over the edge, still lying on the flat of my back.</p>
<p>“Why  not? It might help you to relax.” The water goddess coaxed.</p>
<p>“But  I am relaxed.” Okay, that might’ve came out a bit forced.</p>
<p>I  heard a small splash and a sigh. “At least we know she’s okay  Ruka. Wasn’t it was quite a surprise that it was her friend who  collapsed?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, a great surprise.” It all seemed  suspicious, how could someone with so much power faint from an  overdose of sunlight? Or it might’ve</p>
<p>been an act to win  Kaiya’s sympathy, who knows? “I told you what I saw Michi and you  saw the results too.” I stubbornly reminded the ocean  senshi.</p>
<p>There was an unexpected silence.</p>
<p>“What, you  don’t believe me?” This time I peeked over the edge. Michi was  floating on her back, staring up at the ceiling with half closed  eyes.</p>
<p>“No, I believe you.” Her eyes shifted to meet mine.  “But…someone’s coming, can’t you feel it?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”  I turned towards the changing room’s direction. No, it wasn’t an  enemy…Who else is looking for a swim at this hour of night?</p>
<p>The  changing room door creaked open and out walked a familiar short,  blue-haired, eyed girl.</p>
<p>“Oops…” She squeaked.</p>
<p>“Ami  is it?” I called out from the diving bored. The painfully timid  girl nodded, seeming amazed about something; did she think I’d  forget her name? “Michiru, you’ve met Ami before haven’t  you?”</p>
<p>Michi seemed to stare the girl down with a curious  expression. It caused Ami to squirm uncomfortably on the spot. Jeez  Michi, don’t you know that you scare some people doing that? I know  you don’t mean it but still…I smirked. I remember the feeling  myself, when the two of us first met.</p>
<p>“No…I don’t  believe we’ve been formally introduced.” Michi smiled. The Mizuno  girl seemed too afraid to do anything, so I gave her a helping  hand.</p>
<p>“Michiru, meet Mizuno, Ami. Ami, this is Kaioh  Michiru, the girl who takes waterlogged to a new level.”</p>
<p>“Haruka!”  I heard her gasp. Ahh…That’s the best part about being this high  up, being out of slapping range. Although, that death glare is sure  drilling into my back pretty hard.</p>
<p>“Umm…Nice to meet you.”  Ami finally spoke up.</p>
<p>“So Ami, do you like to swim often?  –don’t pay mind to Haruka.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I like it a lot.”  It sounds like she was finally losing some of that nervousness. “It’s  really helps me to relax after a difficult day.”</p>
<p>“That’s  good to hear.” Michi paused. “How good of a swimmer are  you?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m not sure. Decent I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Want  to race?”</p>
<p>“Race?”</p>
<p>“Why not? I’d let you warm  up first of course. A little competition every now and then would do  me some good.”</p>
<p>“S-Sure.”</p>
<p>As promised Michi let  the Mizuno girl take a few laps around the pool before they decided  to start. I, of course, was to be the starter.</p>
<p>“Ready?  GO!”</p>
<p>The two pushed off the wall and kicked into their  front crawl routine. Finding myself amused with the excitement I  watched each of them carefully, wondering who’d win; Ami seemed to  better than the average swimmer. And who knows, maybe as good as  Michiru. One, two, three, tilt head to the side and breathe…One,  two, three and tilt to the opposite side and breathe…Wow, look at  them go!</p>
<p><strong>Splish, splash!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hah…hah…</strong></p>
<p><strong>Huff,  huff…</strong></p>
<p>“Tie!” I shouted as two hands hit the concrete  edge simultaneously.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV</u></p>
<p>A tie?  No…Why did she slow down? Did she think I wasn’t worth it or  something? However, Before I could get a word out I heard someone  shout,</p>
<p>“Good race!” That didn’t sound like Haruka, I  frowned.</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>I turned to see that Kaiya had  arrived unexpectedly. What was she doing here? And why was she  dressed in a t-shirt and shorts? Was she planning on swimming too?  No, wait a second, she <em>can’t</em> swim! Did Ruka know she was  here? My head shot up to the diving board and I saw that the blonde  had noticed as well. I nervously looked back and forth between the  two; they haven’t made up or anything yet. Secretly I hoped that  Haruka wouldn’t lose it and mess this up.</p>
<p>The silence  ensued while the two spectators eyed the combatants. It was  suffocating; the suspense, the heavy atmosphere…Won’t someone  talk?</p>
<p>“Kaiya, I…”Haruka tried to start. It wasn’t  looking good, I felt myself worry. I don’t know if Ruka can say it.  “I…uhh…”</p>
<p>The other teen crossed her arms before  seemingly to have made up her mind about something. Her facial  features turned into a frown and she began to open her mouth. Was she  going to reject Haruka’s attempted apology? I held my  breath.</p>
<p>“Being the pervert as usual eh, Haruka?”</p>
<p>I  blinked. What did she say?</p>
<p>“What?” My partner shouted  back. “Who’re you calling a pervert?”</p>
<p>“You. Who else?”  Kaiya rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Why I outta…”</p>
<p>“What can  you do? It’s the truth, admit it; you just came to watch girls swim  in bathing suits didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Haruka’s face flushed  furiously. Hmm…I wonder, was that true? I looked towards the blonde  for an explanation.</p>
<p>“So that’s why you refused to come for  a swim then.” I teased.</p>
<p>“No! It’s not what you think.”  Haruka drew an ‘x’ with her arms for emphasis.</p>
<p>“Oh  dear.” Ami joined in.</p>
<p>Soon before we all knew it we were  all laughing our heads off. That went rather well, I thought with a  smile. I knew those two couldn’t stay mad at each other.</p>
<p>“Just  what are you doing here Kaiya?” Haruka muttered, not looking the  shorter blonde in the face.</p>
<p>“Er…to learn how to swim.”  Kaiya barely whispered.</p>
<p>“What? Speak up will ya?”</p>
<p>“To  learn how to swim!”</p>
<p>“Ha! I already know how to swim.”  Haruka gloated, payback for earlier.</p>
<p>“I know that.” Kaiya  snapped back, looking irritated. That pink color spreading across her  cheeks was adorable.</p>
<p>“No need to be embarrassed.” I  assured the teen. “All it means is Haruka had to learn at an  earlier age, that’s all.”</p>
<p>“Bleeeeeeh.” Kaiya blew a  raspberry in Ruka’s direction and in turn, Ruka’s eyebrow started  to twitch.</p>
<p>“Well at least I can swim!” Haruka  retorted.</p>
<p>“Just you wait smart ass.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…I’m  guessing you asked Ami for lessons then?” I casually  inquired.</p>
<p>Kaiya nodded, “That’s right.”</p>
<p>“You  know, you could’ve asked myself or Ruka…” It kind of hurt that  she didn’t ask for our help.</p>
<p>“Like I’d ask for Haruka’s  help. –She probably sucks at it too.”</p>
<p>“Hey! Are you  saying I can’t teach a person how to swim?” Haruka  demanded.</p>
<p>“And…well…” Kaiya hesitated onwards,  completely ignoring the other blonde.</p>
<p>“I can leave if you  want…” Ami timidly offered.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think that’s  necessary.” I responded automatically. Out of my peripheral vision  I could see the wind senshi grow increasingly flustered, being  ignored the entire time.</p>
<p>“HOLD IT!” Everyone suddenly shut  up. “I say we all should teach Kaiya how to swim!” She  commanded.</p>
<p>“Say what?” Kaiya sweat-dropped.</p>
<p>“And  lesson one starts in the water!” Haruka grinned  evily.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p><strong>Splash!</strong></p>
<p>“N-not far!”  Kaiya gasped, as she gripped onto the edge with a death hold.</p>
<p>“Ruka, go get changed.” I bid the taller woman away,  saving the younger blonde for a moment. “And stop laughing.” I  shot a handful of water in the blonde’s direction for  motivation.</p>
<p>“You can let go Kaiya,” Ami told the teen,  “We’re in the shallow end.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Hey, I can touch the  ground.” She mused. I could see her feet prod the bottom cautiously  through the transparent liquid.</p>
<p>“See? Haruka wasn’t  entirely wrong about lesson one.” I smiled. “First step really is  getting into the water. And…you did it.”</p>
<p>“I-I guess I  did!” She beamed.</p>
<p>“Now, lesson two is learning how to back  float. Let’s try to learn this one before Ruka gets  back…”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, several hours later</u></p>
<p><u></u>“I’m  tired…please, no more.” That was a lot harder than I thought it  would be. All I learned was how to front crawl, tread water and  float.</p>
<p>“It is getting late isn’t it?” Michiru half  mumbled to herself. “But excellent progress Kaiya, you really  learned a lot.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t seem like it.”</p>
<p>“Don’t  be like that Kaiya.” Ami chipped in. “It takes years of practice  to become good at it. What you’ve picked up today was  remarkable.”</p>
<p>“You think so?” I asked.</p>
<p>Michiru  nodded her head. “It’s like this, you can start early in  childhood but there’s only so much progress one can make; its  relatively based on strength. The major advantage a person can  receive is experience. That’s why it shouldn’t be too difficult  for you to learn the activity so quickly; you’re mostly grown. All  you need is practice.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I get it.” My arms wrapped  themselves together. I was shivering slightly, perhaps being in the  water for too long caused it?</p>
<p>“And maybe a warm shower too.”  Michiru finished with a giggle. “Don’t worry, you’ll get used  to it.” She seemed to look over to where Haruka was shivering like  crazy, not doing much better than I was.</p>
<p>I grinned at the  sight and then nodded before hoisting myself out of the  ladder.</p>
<p>“Umm…Arigato for the help.” I finally thanked  them. No matter how I looked at it, I felt embarrassed that this many  people decided to help me.</p>
<p>“No problem” Haruka managed to  get out, still shaking as she exited the body of water. I felt my  hair become slightly meshed as her hand ruffled through the top  strands. That was also when I noticed it.</p>
<p>“Hey, what  happened to your arm Haruka? It looks all scratched up.”</p>
<p>“I…er…I  could say the same thing for you.” Her eyes seemed to darken upon  seeing my scrapes.</p>
<p>“I fell…” We both  began.</p>
<p>“Into some thorn bushes!”</p>
<p>“Down the  stairs!”</p>
<p>“So both of you are also clumsy, very  interesting.” Michiru mused. That sparkle in her eye betrayed an  inside joke. What was she laughing at?</p>
<p>“Gah, it’s  freezing! I’ll meet you guys in the lobby.” Haruka dashed off,  reminding me of my own discomfort.</p>
<p>“I think I’ll swim a  few more laps before I leave.” Ami spoke up.</p>
<p>“Okay, I  guess we’ll see you later then.” Michiru waved good-bye to the  younger teen and made her way to follow Haruka.</p>
<p>“See ya, and  thanks again.” I said my farewell as well. I’m  freezing!</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV, lobby</u></p>
<p>“You  weren’t really that cold were you?” Michi walked out of the  change room with a mysterious smile placed on her lips.</p>
<p>“How’d  you guess?” I pretended to be shocked, although I already knew the  answer to <em>that</em> one. “It’ll happen anytime now won’t  it.”</p>
<p>Michiru nodded her head. “You’re getting better at  this.”</p>
<p>“I’ve had practice… What’s the situation? Has  Kaiya left?”</p>
<p>“I think we’re alright; Kaiya left shortly  before I did. Did you see her come past this way?”</p>
<p>“No,  but that doesn’t mean she didn’t take another route. This place  has a lot of exits.”</p>
<p>“Then that  means…”</p>
<p>“Mizuno is the one Ruka.”</p>
<p>“Then we  wait for our cue I guess…”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, change  room</u></p>
<p><u></u>Is Michiru finally gone? I peeked out around the row  of lockers. It seems like it. For a moment there when she turned  around I thought she had spotted me, it was like she was trying to  sense something…Good thing she left though. I really dislike  risking the chance of changing in front of someone, no matter who it  is!</p>
<p>I turned to my locker and rotated the tiny key until a  small click was heard. Following the routine I opened the metal door  and slipped my hands in to grab the dry clothing. Unfortunately my  pants had turned upside down in the mess and my bracelets fell out.</p>
<p>“Oops, can’t have that happening.” I reminded myself.  It would really bite if they broke because I dropped them or  something like that. Examining the mysterious objects I found no  noticeable, visual damage. I stood still for a minute, listening to  make absolute sure that no one was around still. When I heard nothing  I relaxed. Everyone must’ve gone home for the day…Now before Ami  gets out…</p>
<p>“Silence Glaive…” I whispered.</p>
<p>The  symbol of Saturn glowed on both discs, before it became brighter and  increasingly intense. As the flash of purple light ebbed away I found  myself dressed in one of the cloaks I used to wear at home.</p>
<p>“It  still works, whew.”</p>
<p>I discovered this neat feature during  today’s training; when I was lamenting about how useful it’d be  to have Saturn’s silence glaive surprise attack the bracelets  suddenly reacted. It was weird and startled me; I thought I broke  them…Then when the light disappeared, I was like this.</p>
<p>Huh…Leave  it to sis to be the creative one- guess she wanted to be fashionable  during those business travels too, I grinned. However, that password  was genius! Normal people don’t know anything about the scouts and  those who do, well, who would bother memorizing attacks and weapon  names? Er…except me. I scratched my cheek. Note to self, thank my  studying for that one.</p>
<p>“AHHHH!”</p>
<p>Did someone just  scream? It then dawned on me. Ami!</p>
<p><u>Out at the  pool</u></p>
<p>Still disguised I watched the events unfold from the  bleachers. Uranus and Neptune had jumped into action without  me.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>The  youma laughed and then threw both its arms up. Following the motion,  a barricade of water shot up, shielding it from harm’s way. What an  annoying laugh, I frowned. Everything about this one irked me like  many others; the immature water tube around its waist, the snorkel  around its mouth and <em>especially</em> the fact it was holding the  heart crystal! Inching along against the side of the near wall I  slowly made my way behind the enemy. If I can just knock it loose,  I’m sure Uranus would be able to nab it.  Ready…wait…wait…</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!” Uranus launched  another attack. Again the barricade rose again and squashed her power  easily.</p>
<p>“You need to cool off!” The youma mocked. However,  as it raised it’s arms a world shaking collided into its back,  sending it howling in pain.</p>
<p>“YaAaAaH! What the!”</p>
<p>The  heart crystal fell into the miniature whirlpool and carried away by  the currents toward where Neptune swept it up gracefully with the  palm of her hand.</p>
<p>“It’s ours.” She claimed.</p>
<p>“What?  But how!” It spun on the spot. “You!” It hissed.</p>
<p>During  that one moment as Uranus called the attack, I had also released my  own world shaking. That stupid monster thought only one person was  shouting.</p>
<p>“Get them, kill them all!” With  the point of a finger the pool’s water’s diverged and shot out,  attempting to spear us as one would spear fish in a river.</p>
<p><strong> Shink! Shink! Shink! Shink!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I could hear the sound of the  crashing liquid close on my heels. However, as I quickly started to  run out of space I glanced over across the room to see Neptune and  Uranus were barely avoiding trouble themselves. These demons just  keep getting stronger and stronger! I skidded to a stop, hoping to  form an attack but leaped down to ground floor as another barrage  nearly met me.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!” Uranus tried again but  failed. “Argh, stupid defense…!” She cursed. “AH!”</p>
<p>A  stream of water finally hit home on one of its targets.</p>
<p>“Uranus!”  Neptune called out.</p>
<p>We have to finish this fast. In a hasty  decision I tried to penetrate the barrier with my body but was  rebuffed to the side where Uranus and Neptune were stationed.</p>
<p>“Gah!” Skidding across concrete really hurt!</p>
<p>“This  doesn’t look good…” I heard Neptune whisper. Still feeling a  bit off balance, I forced my eyes open to see what she was talking  about.</p>
<p>“Oh crap…”</p>
<p>The water barrier was  extending around from the center of the room, blocking off our access  to the other half. Our only way to get out was to get through this  thing. But what could we do? Uranus’s world shaking had no effect  at all. I looked down to the wounded wind senshi- barely conscious.  I’ve never seen her this weak before, what could’ve tired her out  this much?</p>
<p>“Can you do a deep submerge?” Neptune demanded  in a calm, hopeful voice. She wasn’t even looking at me. Was she  just assuming that I could?</p>
<p>“What’re you planning?”</p>
<p>“To  suffocate that thing.” Her eyes narrowed, seeming to calculate the  possible outcomes. “Uranus’s attack is drawn from the wind,  that’s why it won’t have much effect; wind usually hovers over  water. However…if you’ve noticed, our opponent has surrounded  itself with the substance.”</p>
<p>“And if we can get that weight  to come falling down…” I followed up.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”  Neptune cried out.</p>
<p>“Deep…” Once again the familiar scene  came rushing back; surrounded by the shimmering substance for the  second time today. Except this time, I wasn’t going to back down.  When the watered walls rose up at my sides I raised my own hands  following the action and waited. I needn’t wait long though; almost  immediately thousands of droplets flew off into my palms where they  became a shining blue energy. “SUBMERGE!”</p>
<p>Both attacks  descended upon their target, converging into one blast just moments  before the youma’s barricade shot up to counteract. It was  incredible- the force of two deep submerges pushed their way through  the wall, blasting through and creating a hole where it broke past.  Then as almost on cue, the rest of the liquid followed suite,  crashing down onto its victim. A loud death cry echoed through the  complex but none of us paid it mind.</p>
<p>“Boom.” Neptune  concluded as we watched the waters recede. “Ugh!” She gripped her  head suddenly, sinking onto one knee beside Uranus, who was still  gasping for breath.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?” Came my automatic  response.</p>
<p>“N-nothing. Here, the crystal isn’t what we’re  looking for, give it back to the girl.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p>I watched our ally take the crystal carefully and  then ran to the fainted girl.</p>
<p>“Nep…tune. Are you…alright?”  Uranus gasped.</p>
<p>“I…” I’m crying? But why? A blurred  image continually played before my eyes, interchanging between the  illusion and our reality. The receding water…A shore?</p>
<p>“I  think…I think I just remembered  something…”</p>
