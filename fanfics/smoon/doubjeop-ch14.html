Ami felt a sharp pain in her shoulder as she was jerked off the ground 
by the hand that had latched onto her arm like a vise-grip. She yelled 
out in surprise, panic, and pain, and was blinded by a bright flash of 
light.

Then she felt her body fly through the air and felt her stomach start to 
do somersaults when she realized she wasn&#39;t going to hit the ground 
quite when she had expected. Instead of merely landing on the ground, 
she was falling. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness just enough for her 
to tell she had been thrown down a flight of wire steel stairs. She 
watched as the steps flew by underneath her, until her body hit a wall, 
then she fell on a landing, sending a loud clanging sound ringing 
through the room. Next, the momentum from her fall caused her to roll 
down the next flight of stairs, the sounds of vibrating metal and the 
sensation of pain every time her body came in contact with a step 
suddenly overriding all thought.

Ami normally would have known that what she was about to do next was a 
bad idea, but the current situation unfolded so fast that she didn&#39;t 
have time to think. Acting on reflex and the desire to stop the pain and 
the world from spinning, she stretched out her left arm to try to stop 
her movement. As she rolled down to the next step, She heard a loud, 
wet, cracking sound and screamed out again as a new wave of pain in her 
arm ripped through her senses, suddenly making the rest of the impacts 
with the stairs unnoticeable by comparison. Then, just as suddenly as 
she had started, she came to a stop, lying on her side. After a few 
seconds, her first coherent thought was that she was on the ground, and 
that she hadn&#39;t realized it was possible to experience so much pain that 
one literally could not think. From start to finish, the fall had taken 
only a few seconds, but it had seemed to be an eternity to Ami.

Still dazed, she reflexively moved her right hand to cover her upper 
left arm where it hurt. The moment she felt her fingers touch, she 
clenched her teeth together as hard as she could to suppress another 
yelp of pain. Judging from the level of discomfort, and the odd angle 
she now realized her left arm was twisted in, her left humerus had 
almost certainly been fractured in the fall. She didn&#39;t think it was a 
compound fracture, though, since the bone hadn&#39;t broken through the skin 
as far as she could tell. Regardless, it hurt like hell. She was just 
grateful that it wasn&#39;t her right arm.

A voice from above her asked with some concern, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

As Ami looked around for the source of the voice, she realized that she 
was in perhaps the worst possible of situations. Now that the world had 
steadied itself, and she was becoming aware of her surroundings, she 
could tell she had left the subway station, and for that matter, her 
very version of reality.

She was at the bottom of a large, dark room made primarily of steel. 
Various colors of utility and floor lights as well as computer monitors 
were the room&#39;s only supply of dim light. Pipes and catwalks ran 
seemingly in every direction. Most of the computers were connected by 
copper and plastic conduits. Wires crisscrossed the room, and vents 
hissed out various types of steam. Some of the steam crossed paths with 
red lights, causing the room to somewhat resemble a metallic version of 
hell. Despite that, the room was actually a little on the cooler side 
temperature-wise.

She let her gaze follow the stairs back up the direction she had come 
from. At the top of the stairs was a platform with several work 
stations, high tech computers, and a ten foot tall frame structure with 
wires and indication lights all over it. Ami figured that was probably 
the portal generator, for lack of a better name for the strange device. 
Standing in front of the machine was the owner of the arm that had 
pulled her into this predicament.

Dark Sailor Moon had a small duffel bag slung over her shoulder and was 
leaning over the railing, looking down at Ami. &quot;I do apologize for the 
manner of your abduction. It was one of those now or never kind of 
things.&quot; She shrugged, then added, &quot;Guess you could say, timing was 
everything.&quot; Then she vaulted over the side of the railing and landed in 
front of Ami, helping her to her feet.

Once she was standing, Ami backed away, very slowly edging her way back 
toward the stairs, still nursing her left arm with her other hand. She 
was in no condition to fight, but maybe she could still make a run for 
it. Then just before she reached the stairs, she stopped. Even if she 
was able to beat Serena to the top of the stairs, there was no way she 
would figure out how to turn on the portal and get through it without 
the Scout stopping her. Instead of retreating, she did the only logical 
thing she could do in this situation. Trying to keep her voice neutral, 
she asked, hoping her voice didn&#39;t show how much pain she was really in, 
&quot;Abduction? I thought you wanted us dead. What do you want?&quot;

Dark Moon stepped forward, saying calmly, &quot;The same thing you want. A 
solution to this mess that doesn&#39;t involve having to murder people.&quot; 
When Ami didn&#39;t say anything to that, she continued. &quot;I want you to spy 
on the Sekkou and report your findings to your friends on the other 
side. All you have to do is try to fit in and observe.&quot; Then as she 
pointed her thumb over her shoulder, indicating the portal, &quot;I know Amy 
is safe with your friends. She should remain so at least for the three 
days or so that you&#39;ll be staying with us. Hopefully her experience on 
the other side of the rainbow will allow her to see my point.&quot; She 
dropped the bag she was carrying at Ami&#39;s feet and said in a commanding 
tone, &quot;As I said before, timing is everything at the moment. Detransform 
and put this on.&quot;

&quot;I need more information than that,&quot; Ami said. &quot;I don&#39;t even know what 
is going on. You can&#39;t expect me to --&quot;

Dark Moon interrupted Ami in mid sentence. &quot;Let me put it another way.&quot; 
Her face suddenly turned expressionless, and then, almost as if Serena 
felt the need to remind Ami that she was the leader of the Sekkou even 
if they didn&#39;t actually listen to her, she stepped close to Ami and 
grabbed her left arm just below where Ami&#39;s right hand was clutching it 
in a vain attempt to make the pain stop. The blonde gave it a twist, 
then held it there while Ami yelled out in pain.

While Ami kept yelling in pain, Serena continued. &quot;I&#39;m not asking. I&#39;m 
telling. You&#39;ll get your explanations later.&quot; Then to emphasize her 
point, she put just a touch more pressure on Ami&#39;s arm at key words as 
she spoke. &quot;You are my prisoner. Until I release you, you will report 
directly to me.&quot; With just a touch of anger she finished, &quot;As far as you 
are concerned at the moment, I am your god.&quot;

With one final push to Ami&#39;s arm, Dark Moon let go of Sailor Mercury&#39;s 
arm, causing the Senshi to fall to the ground in agony. Dark Sailor Moon 
said, &quot;Do as I say, without question, and you will be treated well. 
Deviate from my requests, and you will suffer the consequences.&quot; Then, 
nearly pleading, she said, &quot;I promise in the end we will both benefit 
from this.&quot;

For the moment, Ami felt she had no options left to her if she wanted to 
survive. A bright blue ball of water formed around Ami, causing her 
uniform to dissolve into nothing. With a splash, the water disappeared, 
and her normal clothing she had been wearing appeared back on her in a 
sudden flash of light.

As Ami got dressed, she couldn&#39;t help but wonder at how strange it was 
that Serena could go from being almost sympathetic to ruthless in less 
than a second and back again. Mood swings seemed to be typical of the 
Sekkou, though, so perhaps it shouldn&#39;t have surprised her as much as it 
did.

For her part, Dark Moon had turned away to allow Ami some privacy. 
Serena ignored Ami&#39;s yelps of pain while she struggled with getting her 
shirt off and the clothing in the duffel bag on.

After a few more moments of listening to fabric ruffling, Serena heard 
silence. She took the silence as a signal her captive had finished 
dressing and turned around to see Ami now wearing what passed for Amy&#39;s 
&#39;civilian&#39; clothing. It was a solid black militaristic uniform with thin 
light blue trim, and knee high gloss black boots. Despite Ami&#39;s small 
size, it somehow gave her a rather intimidating look.

&quot;Now for the finishing touches.&quot; Serena said. She grabbed Ami&#39;s glasses 
and tossed them under a large piece of machinery. Then she unzipped a 
side compartment on the bag and pulled out a belt with a holster and a 
silver handgun and put it around Ami&#39;s waist.

Next she pulled out a small black box from inside the bag. As she opened 
the box, she said, &quot;I don&#39;t recommend that you transform while you are 
here, since if you use your limited powers, they will instantly give you 
away. Just in case though, I brought something along that will hide that 
nice bright white uniform of yours.&quot; She pulled out a hypodermic needle 
and put the tip of it inside a small vial containing a dark black 
chemical and continued. &quot;This is my supply of . . . medication, 
prescribed by the queen herself so that I would fit in with my re 
engineered teammates. Amy makes it for me. It should last you about 
three days. After that, we will have to get Amy and you switched back to 
your proper places for my plan to have any hope of success.&quot; Not giving 
Ami a chance to react, Serena jabbed the needle deep into Ami&#39;s neck.

Before Ami knew what was happening, she suddenly became dizzy, then felt 
the world start to fade away as she slowly slipped into unconsciousness. 
Serena ignored that, saying, &quot;It&#39;s amazing. You look exactly like her. 
Well, enough playing around. Let&#39;s get you to the infirmary . . . &#39;Amy&#39;. 
We will talk more after we get you fixed up.&quot; Dark Moon then dragged Ami 
out of the room, now ready to implement her plan.
Meanwhile back in the subway, every single individual stared at the spot 
Ami had been just moments ago with looks of anger or horror on their 
faces. The sole exception was Sailor Pluto, who as usual was calm about 
such events. It was Amy that broke the stunned silence.

She started whispering &quot;Oh no, no, no, no,&quot; over and over again, then 
she started to raise her voice a bit as the full impact of the possible 
consequences came to her.

As Dark Mercury continued to get louder, Makoto&#39;s mortified expression 
she had from seeing her one true love disappear from thin air, quickly 
turned to one of rage. Her voice shaking with anger, she said, &quot;Oh, no 
is right, you little . . .&quot; Makoto rolled over, then stood up, now with 
someone to focus her anger on.

Without Ami there to hold her back, Makoto&#39;s wrath was effectively 
unleashed. Sailor Jupiter raced over to Amy so quickly that even Haruka 
was impressed by her speed. Before any of her friends could react, 
Makoto had her hands clutching Amy&#39;s throat. If Amy&#39;s hands hadn&#39;t been 
tied and fastened to the handrail, Makoto would have lifted the woman 
off the ground by her neck. Makoto held her face inches from Amy&#39;s as 
she growled, &quot;You better have a way to get her back or I&#39;ll tear you to 
--&quot; She stopped speaking for a moment when she realized that Amy was 
still repeating &quot;no&quot; over and over again. The Sekkou didn&#39;t appear to 
realize Makoto was even there. Feeling frustration at the current 
situation, and her desire to get revenge for what the Sekkou had done to 
Ami several weeks ago boil to the surface, Makoto sent one of her fists 
crashing against the side of Dark Mercury&#39;s head in an attempt to get 
Amy to snap out of her shock. &quot;Knock it off, damn it!&quot; Makoto yelled.

Before Makoto could throw another punch, all of the remaining Senshi 
were pulling her away. Makoto started to protest and struggle. She 
stopped struggling and allowed her friends to drag her away when she 
realized her attack had had the desired result. Dark Mercury seemed to 
ignore the pain she had to feel from the blow and screamed out to no one 
in particular, &quot;That bitch! She&#39;s going to ruin everything!&quot; Amy stomped 
her foot in frustration then said angrily, &quot;What the hell is she 
thinking?&quot;

Haruka walked Makoto toward a bench farther away to try to cool her 
down, while the others returned to try to talk to Amy now that she had 
come back to what little since she had. Rei said, &quot;Worried Amy is going 
to single handedly ruin all your plans for world domination huh?&quot; Then, 
not trying to hide her sarcasm, she added, &quot;Aw, that would be terrible.&quot; 
Sure that Ami&#39;s double wouldn&#39;t bother to answer, Rei finished with mock 
sympathy, &quot;Wanna talk about it?&quot;

Amy looked back at Rei with a confused expression and said, &quot;Worried 
about . . . oh . . . I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m not talking about your egg headed, 
four eyed, tasteless friend. Most likely, she will either get herself 
killed, or find her way back here on her own. Makes no difference to me 
at the moment really.&quot; Glaring at Usagi she said, &quot;It&#39;s you I&#39;m worried 
about, you blithering idiot.&quot;

Thoroughly irritated for being insulted Usagi said, &quot;I&#39;m not a bitch or 
an idiot, you . . . you . . . you bitch! And Ami won&#39;t get killed, she&#39;s 
too smart!&quot;

Minako leaned toward Usagi and whispered while patting her friend&#39;s 
shoulder, &quot;Oh, good comeback.&quot;

Rolling her eyes, Ami replied, &quot;I&#39;m not talking about you either. I&#39;m 
talking about Serena. You&#39;re merely a convenient focal point for me to 
vent my frustration, you pea brained moron.&quot; Looking Usagi up and down 
for a moment, she amended, &quot;Now that I think about it, the two of you do 
share a lot of qualities. So maybe in an indirect way I was calling you 
a bitch.&quot; She gave a small calculated shrug and batted her eyes 
innocently.

Hotaru leaned on her staff and said quietly to herself as she listened 
to Sailor Moon and Dark Mercury go back and forth insulting each other, 
&quot;Why is it, no matter how powerful, omnipotent, terrifying, arrogant, 
and sure of victory the villains are, they always resort to childish 
petty name calling?&quot;

Setsuna had finally grown tired of the childish show being played in 
front of her. She jabbed the end of her staff on the solid ground, 
making a loud repetitive pounding sound as the noise echoed throughout 
the station and shouted, &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; Once the two bickering women fell 
silent, she said calmly, &quot;The important thing at this exact moment isn&#39;t 
name calling, fighting, gathering information to use against each other, 
or even rescuing Ami.&quot; Pointing her staff at their captive, she said, 
&quot;It&#39;s what to do with you. After we solve that we can focus on other 
issues.&quot;

&quot;Oh, you&#39;ve got a much bigger problem than that,&quot; Amy said with a wicked 
smile. &quot;You see, I&#39;ve managed to get my hands untied.&quot; Laughing, she 
lunged for the nearest Senshi, Usagi. As she did so, she untransformed, 
now wearing a black militaristic uniform with blue trim, and a belt with 
a holster for a small gun. Her gun, however, was not in the holster 
since the barrel was now pressed tightly against Usagi&#39;s right temple. 
All of the Senshi, including Haruka and Makoto, both of whom saw Amy&#39;s 
sudden burst of movement, rushed to form a circle around Amy and Usagi.

&quot;Drop it,&quot; Michiru said, trying to remain calm. &quot;There are eight of us 
and one of you. Even with your ability to fly, you can&#39;t escape or hope 
to win in a fight and you know it, plus you have nowhere to go.&quot;

Amy narrowed her eyes as she studied Michiru for a moment. Then there 
was a high pitched squeal and a light clicking sound as she activated 
the gun. &quot;This is a DLT-15 class 5 laser pulse military grade pistol. It 
leaves a really big exit wound. Can&#39;t win? All I have to do is pull the 
trigger and I promise you, I win. As for where to go, I have an IQ of 
300, so it&#39;s a good bet I can think of something, if I haven&#39;t already. 
Now all of you step away nice and slow, or your pretty princess gets a 
hole the size of a --&quot; Amy suddenly yelled out in pain as a red object 
flying at a high speed glanced off her hand holding the weapon, leaving 
a deep cut. The surprise from the pain caused her to drop her weapon and 
let go of Sailor Moon.

Sailor Moon backed away and joined the circle her friends had formed 
around Amy. Amy applied pressure to the wound on her hand to try to stop 
the bleeding and looked down to see a beautiful red rose had hit the 
pavement hard enough to puncture the concrete. She turned around and saw 
Mamoru dressed as Tuxedo Mask standing calmly, and in Amy&#39;s opinion 
somewhat arrogantly, on the steps leading up to street level. Finally 
admitting defeat, Ami kicked her gun toward Makoto, then turned to 
Setsuna and said, sounding both frustrated and somehow amused, &quot;All 
right, fine. What do you do with me?&quot;

Sailor Pluto said, &quot;The only thing we can. Ami has a life to live, a job 
to hold down, appointments to keep, taxes to pay, that kind of thing. 
Since she isn&#39;t here, someone will have to do those things for her until 
she returns, and you are the best candidate for that responsibility. You 
might happen to relearn a thing or two about friendship while you do 
that, and if so, so much the better.&quot;

Mamoru walked down the stairs and said to Setsuna, &quot;You came to that 
conclusion rather quickly. Are you sure that is wise? She may very well 
learn things she could use to defeat all of us once she is able to get 
back to her friends, and we don&#39;t have any way of insuring that she 
won&#39;t run off on us. To say nothing about convincing her to help us get 
Ami back here.&quot;

Setsuna said calmly, &quot;Ami will find her own way back. As for her running 
off, it&#39;s like Michiru said, she has nowhere to go.&quot;

Minako stepped forward and said, her voice full of accusation as pieces 
came together in her mind, &quot;I don&#39;t believe it. You lied to us.&quot; It took 
everyone a moment to realize Minako wasn&#39;t talking to Dark Mercury. All 
of the Senshi and even Amy watched Sailor Pluto waiting for an 
explanation. When Setsuna remained silent, Minako said angrily, &quot;You 
told us this entire encounter with the Sekkou was not supposed to happen 
which implies the very future was in danger. From what you just said, 
you already know Ami will get back to us just fine.&quot;

Keeping her face expressionless and her eyes locked on Amy, Setsuna said 
calmly, &quot;You&#39;re overanalyzing.&quot;

This time, Makoto spoke. &quot;Is she?&quot; She stood in front of the Senshi of 
time and said, &quot;Tell me, Setsuna. Tell me to my face you didn&#39;t know Ami 
was going to get caught by them. That you didn&#39;t know they would torture 
her. Heck, try telling me with a straight face that you didn&#39;t know Ami 
and I would need help from all of you to get our relationship started. I 
suppose I should at least feel reassured now that I know Ami will be all 
right. But it makes one wonder, what else haven&#39;t you told us?&quot;

Setsuna looked as if she were looking through Makoto to the wall behind 
her. &quot;We have had this conversation already, Makoto. I&#39;m not omnipotent. 
I don&#39;t know word for word, detail by detail, what is going to happen in 
the future, just an outline you might say. It&#39;s my job to make sure the 
future unfolds as it is supposed to.&quot;

A voice behind Makoto asked, &quot;Dose that include telling Serena the exact 
moment a portal will open and when Ami would be at just the right place 
to be pulled through it against her will? Or leaving a sheet of paper 
with the mathematical equation on it that inspired me to build a worm 
hole generator capable of reaching this reality?&quot; Makoto stepped aside 
and looked back at Amy as the smaller woman completed her questions. 
When Setsuna again refused to speak, Amy said, &quot;You set this whole thing 
up. I hate to admit it but, Makoto asks a very good question. What are 
you playing at?&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s reply was to give Amy a mysterious smile and walk past her 
toward the stairs. When she said nothing, Rei yelled, &quot;Isn&#39;t there 
anything you can tell us at all? Or do you just live for playing games 
with our fate?&quot;

Setsuna had reached the stairs and had walked up a few steps by the time 
Rei spoke to her. She stopped a moment, looked over her shoulder and 
said, &quot;You want to know your future?&quot; Then she turned away and started 
walking up the stairs, saying, &quot;You will find out soon enough.&quot;

----------

At first, she was aware of nothing but darkness and blessed silence. 
Then, Ami could hear the sounds of her friends talking, almost as if 
they were in the distance. Their voices echoed in her skull almost as if 
their words were a dream. The strange thing was, she couldn&#39;t quite 
understand them because of the splitting headache she had at that 
moment. Slowly, the darkness turned to a bright blur as she opened her 
eyes. As they began to focus as best they could without her glasses, a 
familiar pair of concerned green eyes came into view.

&quot;She&#39;s coming around.&quot; Despite the fact that the tall woman was speaking 
quietly, her voice roared in Ami&#39;s ears like a jackhammer.

Ami brought up her hand and put it on her forehead, trying to ward off 
the pain. As she shifted in bed, she was vaguely aware of the cast and 
sling her left arm was wrapped in. &quot;What did I miss?&quot; She groaned 
groggily, in an attempt to get a feel for the current situation. The 
last thing she remembered was she had been scanning Amy for information 
and then the strange sensation of falling and . . .

Minako&#39;s face came into view and asked, &quot;How is she doing, Lita?&quot;

&quot;Lita?&quot; Ami said, sitting up, startled for a moment, before the rest of 
her memory came back to her. The world spun about crazily, and if it 
hadn&#39;t been for a pair of strong hands grabbing onto her, Ami would have 
fallen out of the bed she had been neatly placed in.

Once Lita was sure Ami had her balance, she pushed Ami&#39;s shoulders back 
gently but firmly and said, &quot;Maybe you should lie down a few more 
minutes?&quot;

Ami looked around and saw that it was just the three of them, in a room 
with several beds in it, probably the infirmary. She felt nervous about 
being this close to the two Sekkou knowing she had no one to turn to for 
help. The memory of her conversation with Serena slowly came back to her 
and she allowed Lita to push her back on the bed.

For some reason it took her a bit more concentration to make herself 
stay calm than she thought it should. Quite a bit more. She could still 
feel the echo of fear gripping her heart from the moment she first 
realized Lita wasn&#39;t Makoto. As she thought about her current situation, 
there was also a strangely powerful feeling of rage when she thought 
about how Serena had gotten her into this mess. As she continued to 
think more about things, she found it odd that every passing thought 
seemed to have a fairly powerful emotion to it. Perhaps she wasn&#39;t fully 
conscious yet? She closed her eyes again, trying to rest for a moment. 
Too many thoughts were rushing through her brain too quickly and it was 
difficult to concentrate.

Just when she was almost calm, the last part of her memory from before 
she went unconscious came back to her. Her eyes snapped open and she 
said, startled, &quot;It must be the -- &quot;

She cut herself off and finished the thought in her head. &#39;It must be 
the injection.&#39; She gritted her teeth tightly together for a moment and 
smacked her fist down on the mattress as hard as she could, moments away 
from having a temper tantrum.

She felt infuriated at being drugged by Serena. She had been embarrassed 
about having trouble keeping her emotions in check lately, but that had 
been different. By comparison, this was maddening. It felt like every 
passing feeling was multiplied by ten. If this was how the Sekkou felt 
every moment of their lives, it was no wonder they were so violent and 
moody.

Lita gently put her hand over Ami&#39;s clenched fist and said, &quot;Just relax 
for a moment. You&#39;re still disoriented.&quot;

Ami closed her eyes again, trying to regain control over her emotions. 
It seemed the harder she tried the more difficult it was. She felt 
scared, angry, and confused all at the same time. The blurred vision 
didn&#39;t help to improve her mood much either.

Ami&#39;s face must have betrayed how she felt, because Minako leaned over 
the foot of the bed to look at Ami and asked in a voice almost like that 
of a police officer asking a criminal a question, &quot;Amy, Think! What 
happened to you? Why didn&#39;t you retreat when I gave the order?&quot;

She thought about Amy being trapped under the steel beam, and Makoto 
trying to convince her to leave the trapped Sekkou to die. At the time 
she felt sympathetic to her enemy, but now she wished she had done as 
her girlfriend had suggested. Then the thought about how she had been 
viciously thrown down a flight of stairs by Dark Moon, all in the name 
of the crazed blonde&#39;s plan (which she still didn&#39;t fully understand) 
entered her mind.

Perhaps a lie with a version of the truth thrown in would be the most 
believable? She had to fight her lips from forming a smile for a moment 
as several ideas on how to turn her answer into a way to get revenge on 
Dark Moon entered her mind. The idea was tempting, but she kept herself 
from doing that only because Serena&#39;s &#39;captivity&#39; of her would help her 
to get answers the Senshi desperately needed. At the same time, it 
bothered her that Dark Moon felt whatever information Ami found out 
would somehow benefit the Sekkou as well. She had a distant feeling of 
guilt when the thought entered her mind that she shouldn&#39;t be thinking 
that way to begin with. Revenge was wrong . . . wasn&#39;t it? She suddenly 
wasn&#39;t so sure.

She finally decided on a modified version of the truth. &quot;The ceiling 
above me collapsed and I was trapped under a support beam. Two of the 
Senshi came up to me and argued about whether to help me, or let me die, 
and they decided to leave me to my fate. Once they left, I was able to 
free myself and activate my portal. After that, I don&#39;t remember what 
happened. I don&#39;t even remember getting through the portal. Must have 
been smoke inhalation.&quot;

Lita gently stroked Ami&#39;s cheek and said, &quot;Serena found you on the floor 
just outside the R.C.C. You must have gotten yourself that far after 
getting back.&quot; Then with more concern than Ami would have ever guessed 
possible for Dark Jupiter she said, &quot;You scared the hell out of me. The 
next time I tell you to stay close to me, do it.&quot;

Ami cringed inwardly when Lita leaned down. She was just about to kiss 
Ami when Serena&#39;s voice said from across the room, &quot;Satisfied now, 
Mina?&quot; As Lita jerked her head away to glare at Usagi&#39;s double, Ami 
looked over to see Dark Sailor Moon standing in the door way with a look 
that said, &#39;I told you so&#39; plastered on her face. &quot;You really should 
place a little more faith in my honesty.&quot;

Mina folded her arms. If looks could kill, the look Mina was giving 
Serena would have turned her into a little puddle of slimy goo. &quot;Faith? 
In you? Since when are you deserving of such honor?&quot;

Ray appeared over Serena&#39;s shoulder in the doorway and pushed her out of 
the way, interrupting what seemed to be an old argument. When she spoke, 
she sounded nervous. &quot;I hate to interrupt, but the queen is still 
waiting for our report on our mission.&quot; Looking at Ami, she said, &quot;Can 
you stand?&quot;

&#39;Queen? What queen?&#39; Ami thought to herself. &quot;It&#39;s just my arm,&quot; she 
said as she got off the bed. She was thankful to whatever god had given 
the Senshi their rapid healing powers, because the cast and sling were 
already starting to get on her nerves. There was no way she would be 
able to stand being in that thing as long as a normal person would have 
to endure it.

She followed the others out, being careful to let at least one of the 
Sekkou lead the way since she had absolutely no idea where they were 
going other than to see this queen. They walked through several small 
hallways until they came to a large corridor, with the only door being a 
huge one at the end of it. The rest of the Sekkou were waiting 
impatiently.

Once they reached the door and the other Sekkou, Ami expected someone to 
open it, but no one did. After a few more moments, Ami realized they 
were waiting to be let in. The nervousness of the others seemed to be 
contagious because Ami was starting to feel that way too. The thought 
that something could make the twisted Sekkou nervous disturbed her. The 
only movement from any of them was Mina pacing anxiously.

Finally Amara said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we just go in and get this over with?&quot;

Mina stopped pacing and said, &quot;Oh sure, that&#39;s easy for you to say. 
You&#39;re not the one who gets to tell her we screwed up.&quot;

The only two who didn&#39;t look nervous were Dark Pluto and Saturn. They 
almost seemed to find the reactions of the others amusing. Hotaru said 
excitedly, &quot;I&#39;d be happy to inform her.&quot;

Lita looked at her in disbelief. &quot;What are you so worked up about? You 
failed just as badly as we did! What makes you think she will be any 
happier with your performance?&quot;

Hotaru smiled and said sweetly, &quot;We weren&#39;t in charge of it. We were 
more like casual observers. Why, with the plan you all came up with, it 
was almost as if . . .&quot; She let her voice trail off as she thought about 
her next words for a moment. Then she said, switching her tone to a 
taunt as she looked over at Dark Moon, &quot;You didn&#39;t have your hearts in 
it.&quot;

Before Serena could say anything, the door opened slowly and quietly by 
itself. A woman&#39;s voice called out to them from the darkness of the 
room, &quot;To be back this soon must mean one of two things. Total victory, 
or dismal failure. I am interested to hear which it is.&quot;

The Sekkou straightened up and walked in as if they had all the 
confidence in the world. Ami followed their lead as her nervousness 
quickly gave way to curiosity to see who it was that commanded them.

Ami found the room to be excessively big, and poorly lit. The only light 
was from somewhere high above the ceiling in the center of the room, 
illuminating a small area of the floor. She was sure the owner of the 
voice was somewhere in the shadows. The nine warriors stood in a 
straight line next to each other just at the edge of the light, looking 
forward into the darkness.

After a few more moments, a woman walked out of the shadows. She looked 
to be about seven feet tall, with a slim figure, long red hair, and she 
wore a tight purple gown. Ami had never seen the woman before as far as 
she could remember. The woman gave off such an aura of power that Ami 
had no doubt this woman was the queen the Sekkou kept referring to. She 
walked casually up and down the line of her henchmen, looking into the 
eyes of each every time she passed them, as if searching their souls. 
Every time she made eye contact with Ami, she became concerned that this 
woman might know she didn&#39;t actually belong here.

About the third or fourth time the woman walked down the line, she said, 
&quot;It must be total failure you have come to inform me of. No gloating? No 
stories of victory and conquest? No charts and graphs to show me how 
close you were to success or what you need to win next time?&quot; Sweeping 
her hands outward she said, indicating what she felt was the biggest 
clue, &quot;No bodies?&quot; She stopped in front of Ami and said, clearly meaning 
it to sound like an insult, &quot;Perhaps it was a lack of intelligence?&quot;

Ami could feel her heart race in fear when she realized the woman wanted 
her to answer. She looked up at the woman and said, unable to hide her 
anxiety, &quot;Your . . . your majesty, the task you have given us is 
difficult. It may take quite some time for resu--&quot; Ami didn&#39;t need the 
woman to say anything to know she wanted her to be quiet. The look this 
queen was giving her said it all.

&quot;More time? Results?&quot; The tall woman snapped angrily. &quot;I have given you 
plenty of things. I gave you equipment to build your precious Project 
Rainbow. I gave you time to learn how to use it. I gave you time to 
gather intelligence on your enemies. I gave you the warriors you 
requested, time to train them, and then time to formulate a plan. And 
what have you given me in return? Nothing.&quot;

&quot;Queen Beryl, this despicable display of failure wasn&#39;t Amy&#39;s fault,&quot; 
Trista said from farther down the line.

As Queen Beryl walked to her loyal servant, Ami&#39;s mind began to race. 
Despite how long the fight in her version of reality had gone with 
Beryl, the only Senshi to ever actually see her face to face was Usagi. 
Some things started to make sense, but she was already starting to form 
questions in her mind she wanted to ask Dark Moon as soon as the two of 
them were alone.

&quot;You see, your highness,&quot; Trista began the moment Beryl looked at her, 
&quot;Amy&#39;s plan was working just fine. There were a few minor setbacks, but 
we were able to compensate.&quot; The tall dark green haired woman looked 
down the line of Sekkou to see Mina still staring forward and said, 
&quot;That is, until Dark Sailor Venus gave us the order to retreat because 
of a few more unforeseen events.&quot;

She smiled and finished, &quot;Your highness, if she had asked for my advice, 
or, had I been in charge, I would have simply suggested we wait for them 
to leave the building. No your highness, it wasn&#39;t bad planning. Merely 
incompetent leadership, that led to our failure.&quot;

Mina didn&#39;t wait for Beryl to address her. She stepped out of the 
formation and looked at Trista, with fury blazing in her eyes. &quot;I made a 
decision that saved our hides! The element of surprise had been lost, 
and they were able to counter attack every attempt we made to neutralize 
one of them. Plus we were blinded and being suffocated by smoke! I had 
no choice but to make a decision!&quot;

Ami watched Beryl as best she could without her glasses, as Beryl slowly 
walked toward Mina, her feet making a loud tapping sound whenever they 
lightly touched the ground. Mina stammered, &quot;Your . . . your excellency, 
It was the only thing we could do! We needed to fall back and try again 
later! We had no choice!&quot; As Beryl continued to walk down to Mina, much 
like a predator stalking its prey, she tried to plea for forgiveness one 
last time. &quot;We had no . . .&quot; Mina finally stopped begging, realizing she 
wasn&#39;t going to convince Beryl who was to blame for the failure. She 
glared at Beryl defiantly, thinking to herself that she would face 
whatever punishment the queen handed out with whatever dignity she could 
muster.

Beryl stopped several feet away from Mina. Without a word, the 
Ginzuishou materialized in her hand. It took Ami a moment to realize 
what it was because everything was so fuzzy. Once she noticed, she was 
shocked to see Beryl had it, instead of Dark Moon. Beryl raised the wand 
and pointed it at Mina saying, &quot;You know the price of failure.&quot; Before 
the last word had completely left her lips, Beryl sent a wave of energy 
at Mina.

The Sekkou of hate was enveloped in a bright flash of light, which 
seemed to seep into her skin, then nothing. Mina stood there sweating a 
bit, clearly agitated, but appeared fine. At first Ami didn&#39;t understand 
what was so traumatizing about it. Then, as Mina screamed out, her skin 
began to slowly blister, and her hair began to fall out. She fell to her 
keens shrieking in terror and pain, as her skin started to dissolve. It 
took Ami a moment to realize that all of Mina&#39;s flesh was actually 
melting. Steam rose from her as she continued to scream and twitch long 
after it should have been possible to do so. Ami could see muscle, bone, 
and after a short while, some of her internal organs, before they too 
started to dissolve into a gel. Mina finally stopped moving about the 
time her eyes turned to soft gelatinous masses. In the end, all that 
remained was a charred skeleton in the middle of a dark colored liquid 
that couldn&#39;t really be called blood at this point.

Ami was both mortified and thrilled to see one of her foes taken out in 
such a way. She didn&#39;t realize how out of character her thoughts where 
for her, until her mind said quietly in her skull, &#39;One down, eight more 
to go!&#39; Then she thought to herself, &#39;What am I thinking!? That woman 
just died! And if you&#39;re not careful, you could be next! . . . I can&#39;t 
wait for these drugs to wear off. I hate feeling this way.&#39;

Then, from what little remained of Mina, the light reemerged and formed 
into a tiny spark, the size of a pebble. It floated toward Beryl almost 
as if carried on a breeze. Beryl held out her hand and grabbed it in her 
fist for a moment, a little bit of light coming from between her fingers 
as she did so. To the others she said, &quot;That is the price of failure.&quot; 
Opening her hand again, she let the small starlike speck go back to it&#39;s 
body. As she did so, she said bitterly, &quot;If I didn&#39;t need you to defeat 
the Senshi, I would absorb your soul and use it to make a wonderful 
yoma. But alas, I can&#39;t dispose of you yet.&quot;

She raised the Ginzuishou, sending a soft ray of light at Mina&#39;s charred 
corpse and watched as Mina&#39;s body pulled itself together again. 
Apparently, the process was rather uncomfortable, because as Mina&#39;s body 
started to reanimate, it was clear she was still very much in pain. It 
looked as if she was experiencing the exact same thing she had gone 
through, only in reverse. Finally, Mina, her eyes wide in terror, lay on 
the floor once again, terrified, but intact and alive.

&quot;Now, get up.&quot; Beryl said coldly. Then to all of them she said, &quot;I am a 
generous ruler, therefore I will give you more time to plan your next 
attack. Now, get out of my sight before I decide I have no further use 
for you.&quot;

Ami and Lita helped Mina to her feet, then all of the Sekkou and Ami 
scrambled for the door as fast as they could.
