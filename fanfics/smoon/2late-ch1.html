<h1>Am I too Late?</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mwarrior1.html">Moon Warrior 1</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is my first typed fanfiction. The first I am putting online.  
So please go easy on me.  This is going to be in &#147;present day&#148; tense.  
I&#146;ll explain later.  I&#146;m using the dub names.   No flames please, or 
at least make them constructive, appreciate your input.

To submittees, my use of punctuation is to express emotions, please 
don&#146;t change it.  Finally:  I reserve the right to pull this down for 
any reason :i.e.:  Too many flames.  Sorry to be so long winded, now 
on to the story.  

Okay, this part is done, there is going to be a second part. This 
Fanfic covers, the first two parts of Sailor Moon R, up to the 
beginning of the last part.  In other words, this starts with the 
Negaverse, continues through with Ann and Alan, then finishes at the 
beginning of the Negamoon attacking.  It starts with Zoicite 
collecting the Rainbow Crystals.  There is no violence in this part or 
chapter.  However their may be in Part two.  If I didn&#146;t make this 
clear, this contains Adult content.  Sorry for repeating myself, and 
sorry to keep you waiting, now on with the fanfic.
                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;Please tell Serena I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

  &#147;I&#146;ll give her the message.&#148;

 &#147;Thank you Mrs. Tsukino.&#148;

 &#147;And Amy, try food.&#148; 

&#147;Sob. I&#146;ve tried that.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll talk to her then.&#148;

&#147;Thank you.&#148;

Amy thought back, it had been a week since she had betrayed Serena.  
She..No it wasn&#146;t the right thing, the fact was Rei intimidated her. 
When Rei suggested they not go with Serena to fight the Negaverse, she 
had wanted to go.  But Rei was&#133;  Not scary, but convincing.  Rei made 
her listen, until she caved

Hours later, Amy lay in bed trying to sleep.  She thought about the 
week.  Serena had been meaner to Rei than usual.  Even actually 
managing to ignore her and walk away without speaking.  But, at least 
she spoke to Rei in the same way.  To Amy, she had been distant and&#133; 
cold.  That was it.  Serena was like the sun to her or the bright 
moon.  But now there was an eclipse.  She was polite at meetings, too 
polite.  But she didn&#146;t want to be alone together.  Or do anything 
unless Lita was there.  She envied Lita, who had the courage to go 
fight the priest when Zoicite had turned him into a monster,  Lita 
told her it had been hard.,  Finally Amy fell to sleep.

  &#147;Amy woke up the next afternoon.&#148;

&#147;Omigod I&#146;m late for school.  As she was getting leaving she saw a 
note.&#148;

&#145;Amy, I let you sleep in because I know you&#146;ve been upset.  Mrs. 
Tsukino called, Serena says she&#146;ll, and I quote.&#148;parley with you.&#148;.  
She says you name the place.  But not at her house.&#146;  Mom.

&#147;Oh thank God&#148;  &#145;Oops, now I&#146;m talking to myself.  I have to make up 
with Serena.&#146;

At school Serena was the same.  But she did say after school, they 
could meet, alone.  Amy told her, they&#146;d go to her place, since her 
mom was a doctor and usually out. Serena agreed.

  Later at Amy&#146;s.

&#147;Would.. would you like a snack.&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Serena please sit down.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Look&#133; I don&#146;t need to sit.&#148;

&#147;Serena I..&#148;

&#147;I know-&#147;

&#147;You do oh that&#146;s-

&#147;You think Rei should be leader.&#148;

&#147;NO!  I mean I-

&#147;You do.&#148;

&#147;No I don&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;Then&#133;&#148;

&#147;I.. I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;You mean it.&#148;

&#147;Of course I do.&#148;

&#147;No&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Not good enough.&#148;

&#147;WHAT?&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Can&#146;t accept.&#148;

&#147;Serena&#133;&#148;

  &#147;I should go.&#148;

&#147;no,&#148; she whispered.

&#147;PLEASE DON&#146;T LEAVE ME ALONE!&#148;

&#147;Amy.&#148;

&#147;You.. You are not leaving until this IS SORTED OUT!&#148;

 &#147;FINE.&#148;

&#147;You forgave Rei.&#148;

&#147;I expect this from Rei.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Amy I (tears flowing), Rei needs to feel in control.  She, I know 
she&#146;s had it hard, so by controlling thing she thinks things won&#146;t get 
worse.&#148;

Amy was stunned by this suddenly mature Serena.

&#147;But, I never thought you would.. look down on me.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Tears were running down Serena&#146;s face.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re the only person who thinks&#133;who thought I could be something.&#148;

&#147;I do.&#148;

&#147;No, or you&#133;&#148;

&#147;Serena I-

&#147;You&#146;re the only person who took time to&#133; I don&#146;t know, who&#133;who 
thought I wasn&#146;t a failure.&#148;

&#147;You took time to explain things to me&#133; You thought.  You didn&#146;t look 
at me and see Serena the &#133;&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry. I am so&#133;&#148;  Amy was crying now too.

&#147;That&#146;s why, it hurt so much and&#133; 

&#147;Serena?&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t want to hurt you.&#148;:Serena explained

&#147;But- 

&#147;You&#146;re&#133; crying.&#148;

&#147;I..&#148;  Amy went to hug Serena.

Serena backed away.&#148;No.&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#145;I don&#146;t know&#133;I feel hurt when I look at you.&#148;

&#147;Please.&#148;

&#147;Give me time Amy.&#148;

&#147;Isn&#146;t there a way you could forgive me now.&#148;

Serena thought for a minute.  &#147;There is one way.  But, no you 
couldn&#146;t..  I don&#146;t think you could..&#148;

&#147;PLEASE.&#148;

&#147;Alright, a friendship kiss.&#148;

&#147;Like a kiss on the cheek.&#148;

&#147;No, do you..?&#148;

&#147;Just tell me.&#148;

&#148;A full open mouth kiss.&#148;

Amy was stunned.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, I shouldn&#146;t have men-

&#147;Okay.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll do it.&#148;

&#147;Really.&#148;

&#147;If you&#146;ll forgive me yes.&#148;

&#147;Then no.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;This kiss is a promise of friendship.  Something to look back on when 
things are tough.  Not just to get something.  Molly and I did it.  
It&#146;s to prove how much we mean to each other.&#148;

Amy could feel her chance slipping away.  &#147;Wait, this is about 
friendship, ours, I want you back Serena, I want you to smile at me 
again, this is about friendship.&#148;

&#147;Okay, But there&#146;s no going back.&#148;

&#147;What do you mean?&#148;

&#147;Are we doing this or not?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

Amy wasn&#146;t sure what to do.  Serena came towards her gracefully, like 
Luna would move when hunting.  Amy started to back away.

Suddenly Serena was Serena again.  &#147;It&#146;s alright&#133;Uhm, one thing 
though, this is about friendship, not love.  I&#133;This is a bond of 
between friends, not lovers.&#148;

&#147;Lovers?!  Serena I&#146;m not gay!&#148;

&#147;Okay ready?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Close your eyes.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Do you trust me?&#148;

Amy closed her eyes.

Amy could feel the air move as Serena glided toward her.  Then she 
felt strong arms around her.  Then soft lips met hers.Amy was stilled. 
First a soft kiss.  Then , again came Serena&#146;s lips.  She felt a 
tongue open her lips. Then, Sereena really started kising her, slowly 
at first exploring her mouth.  Amy wasn&#146;t sure what to do, then 
instinct took over.  She returned the kiss.  For what seemed forever 
Serena was kissing her.  Then Amy was ripped from pleasure as Serena 
stopped.

&#147;Matte.&#148;  Amy whispered.

&#147;Thank you Amy, I&#146;m not mad anymore.  See you in school tomorrow.  
Bye.&#148;

And Serena left, leaving Amy whispering.  &#147;Chotto matte.&#148;

Okay, First part done, I do not own Sailor Moon Naoko Takeuchi does, 
along with others.  Okay tired now.  Need sleep.  Finish my 
interjection tomorrow.  Ja matta.  Oh, yeah matte means wait, chotto 
means a little, chotto matte. Wait a little or please wait.  If this 
is wrong, please inform. Good night.

I could leave it like this, but I want to do more, I also hate when 
people just leave the ending hanging a little, so on with the story.  
Oh, and partly rested.  Let&#146;s see how I do.

As Zoicite was collecting the Rainbow Crystals, Amy finally built up 
the courage to ask Serena if they could kiss again.&#148;

&#147;Amy, I&#146;m sorry, but my heart belongs to another.&#148;

&#147;Who?!&#148;

&#147;Tuxedo Mask.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Would you be willing to share my love.  To know that you&#146;re not the 
only person I&#146;m with.&#148;

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Then I&#146;m sorry.  Now let&#146;s get shopping.&#148;

&#147;O..okay.&#148;

&#147;It was both heaven and hell as Serena grabbed her hand to make her 
leave the park faster.&#148;

&#147;Soon though Amy found or was found by Greg, Serena was actually happy 
for her.  Although, she, Rei and Lita tagged along for the first few 
dates.  &#147;Just to make sure the Negaverse doesn&#146;t spoil it.&#148;.  So maybe 
Serena was a little jealous.

Then Darien was later revealed to be Tuxedo Mask and Serena, the Moon 
Princess.  It hurt, but Amy hid it well, so did Rei, although she 
hurt, because of Darien.

When Darien was forced to work for the Negaverse and Greg living far, 
Amy asked Serena if they could be together for a while.  Serena tried, 
but she couldn&#146;t.  When they tried to kiss. Serena would break down in 
tears.  She also reminded Amy that they weren&#146;t lovers.  Just friends 
who could have a moment.  Amy agreed, although, not on the inside.  
Serena ended up being held in Amy&#146;s arms the whole night.  Whispering 
to Darien, and crying in her sleep.  In the morning Serena told her 
she felt too guilty to be with her while Darien was trapped and 
brainwashed.  Amy understood.  But, it had been worth it to be able to 
hold Serena, even if she didn&#146;t get much sleep.


 After The Negaverse was defeated and Amy got her memories back.  She 
asked Serena again.  Greg had brought up the idea of seeing other 
people since they live too far from each other.  (Author apologizes to 
Greg fans.  Gomen.).  Amy was heartbroken.  But Serena was waiting for 
Darien.  Amy almost shouted at her.  But instead, the next day she got 
Darien&#146;s phone number from Andrew.

&#147;Hello, Darien.&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;This is Amy Mizuno, Serena&#146;s friend.&#148;

&#147;Oh, yeah the smart one.&#148;

&#147;Hmph.&#148;

&#147;Sorry, it&#146;s been a long day between college than your friend and 
Ann.&#148;

&#147;Are you doing calculus?&#146;

&#147;Yeah it&#146;s a little hard.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t think so.&#146;

&#147;Did you call to talk about school.&#148;

&#147;Gomen, is there any chance of you and Serena getting b&#133; I mean 
dating.&#148;

&#147;Me and Meatball Head, I don&#146;t think so.  Not that she isn&#146;t ,,,  Well 
she&#146;s a little young for me, and she&#146;s&#133;&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t tell her I said this, but, she&#146;s a little too dizty.&#148;

&#147;So, no chance.&#148;

&#147;Why you so interested?&#148;

&#147;&#133; Because I&#146;m her friend.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s it.&#148;

&#147;I want her to be able to get on with her life.&#148;

&#147;Whoa,&#133; I&#133; I like having her around.  I mean&#133;&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re not interested.&#148;

&#147;Well&#133;&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t want to date her.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..No&#133; That is&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yes or no please?

&#147;&#133;.. No&#133;&#148;

&#147;Thank you Darien, see you around bye.&#148;

Amy couldn&#146;t believe she did that, calling up Darien and asking him 
about Serena.  &#145;Now for the next step&#146; 

&#147;Hello, Serena.&#148;

&#147;Hi Ames, what&#146;s up?&#148;

&#147;Could you come over please.&#148;

&#147;Sure, why?

&#147;It&#146;s about Darien.&#148;

&#147;Be right there.&#148;

Serena didn&#146;t even hang up the phone .  Amy was able to hear.  
&#147;ByemomgoingtoAmy&#146;sCallyoulater.&#148;.  Then  &#147;That girl&#148;, as the phone 
was hung up.

It took about five minutes for Serena to arrive.

&#147;Huff, huff, huh, huh.&#148;

&#147;Come in Serena.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, huff, sure.&#148;

&#147;Please sit down.&#148;

Serena sat on the couch.

&#147;What&#146;s this about Darien?&#148;

&#147;Serena, gomen, I talked to him and-&#147;

&#147;You talked to him what&#146;d he say&#148;

&#147;Take a deep breath and, once again I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;WHAT&#146;D HE SAY?&#148;

&#147;He&#133;He&#133;&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;I shouldn&#146;t have acted, please forget, I said anything.&#148;

Serena started crying.

&#147;Please&#133; tell me.&#148;

&#147;He might be, but maybe not.&#148;

&#147;JUST TELL ME.&#148;

&#147;Two things:  He might be inerested-

&#147;Really, thanks Amy, I&#146;ll go-

&#147;Wait.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;He sounded interested but-

&#147;Yeah?&#148;

&#147;Said he wasn&#146;t.&#148;

&#147;no.&#148;.  She whispered.

&#147;And-

&#147;There&#146;s more?&#148;

&#147;He does..  He doesn&#146;t want to&#133; date you.&#148;

&#147;No..&#148; she said as she started crying.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry.&#148;

&#147;Why did you talk to him?  I might&#146;ve had a chance if&#133;&#148;

&#147;Serena please-

&#147;I&#146;m leaving&#133;  That was really mean.&#148;

&#147;Serena, please.&#148;

&#147;Bye!&#148;

&#147;MATTE!&#148;

&#147;Fine, you have two seconds.&#148;

&#147;&#133;It was a waste of time.&#148;

&#147;WHAAT?&#148;

&#147;I mean, I just (crying now)&#133; wanted you to be free.&#148;

&#147;To be free?&#148;

&#147;I need you and, &#133;  You wouldn&#146;t be with me.&#148;

&#147;I am with you.&#148;

&#147;Not like..&#148;

&#147;The kiss&#133;&#148;

&#147;Amy, I tried, no I should&#146;ve told you.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;After Molly and I kissed, for awhile she wanted to be with me too.&#148;

&#147;Molly&#133; wanted you.&#148;

&#147;She said I&#133;It&#146;s&#133;I&#146;ll sound like &#133;  I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;Full of yourself.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Like you think you&#146;re really great.&#148;

&#147;Yeah well, Molly said I&#133; Turned her off men.  Because I was the 
kindest person she knew and the best kisser.  But I&#146;m not that kind or 
a great kisser.

&#147;You&#146;re wrong, on both subjects.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Molly was right.&#148;

&#147;Oh, well then she really saw Melvin and now she&#146;s&#133;  You still want to 
be with me.?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s why you called Darien&#133;&#148;

&#147;Of course&#133; I wasn&#146;t trying to hurt you.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I asked you once if you could share my love, you said no.&#148;

&#147;But Darien-

&#147;I still love him.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;So, I guess I should&#133;

&#147;Half of something is better than nothing.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Please&#133;stay&#148;

&#147;You mean.&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Be sure&#133;and what about Greg?&#148;

&#147;He&#133;he wants to see other people.&#148;

&#147;Oh, let me call my mom.&#148;

&#147;Okay and&#133;&#148;

&#147;Just sit down and wait.&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

Amy could hear Serena tell her mom she was spending the night.  And 
that they would be studying.  She heard Serena thank her mom and then.

&#147;Amy&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#147;

&#147;You ready?&#148;

&#147;&#133;.  Yeah.&#148;  She said huskily.

Serena glided over to the couch and took Amy&#146;s hand.  She then walked 
her to the bedroom.  Amy had planned it so her mom wouldn&#146;t be home.  
So they were alone.

Serena led Amy to the bed and lay her down.

&#147;Amy, one last thing.&#148;

&#147;Please, just be with me.&#148;

&#147;You know I&#146;ll still be&#133;going after Darien.&#148;

&#147;I can live with that.&#148;

&#147;And-

&#147;Please just-

&#147;Alright, but I&#146;ve nev-

&#147;Please.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

Sorry to interrupt but we may be going into 18+.  So minors, rules say 
to stop reading.  Warning, I may be bad at love scenes, so warned in 
advance.  And gomen means sorry, gomen nasai means really sorry, but 
not sure about gomen nasai.  Okay, if you don&#146;t like love scenes 
between girls or women, please leave.  Finally, I&#146;m taking a page from 
the manga.  Serena&#146;s breasts were pretty big there, so.  I guess you 
may be able to tell what sex I am now, than again maybe not.  Now on 
with this.  To recap, P.G. 18.  Female love scene.  If offended, 
please leave.

Serena got on top of Amy, she kissed her lightly on the mouth.  Then, 
soft kisses over her face.  Finally she went for her mouth softly at 
first, then slowly, ever so slowly opened her mouth.  Once again Amy 
felt that feeling after waiting so long.  She moaned in the kiss. Then 
purred with pleasure.  Greg, when he kissed her was too inexperienced.  
Or too rough when she asked him to kiss her harder.  Serena&#146;s kisses 
were just perfect.

Serena pulled away and gazed into her eyes.

&#147;How far?&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;How far do you want me to go?&#148;

&#147;I..I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;Just tell me when to stop.&#148;

&#147;Yes and Arigtou.&#148;

&#147;No, no need.&#148;

&#147;No more.&#148;

&#147;Serena stiffened.&#148;

Amy laughed.  Serena was stunned

&#147;No more talking.&#148;

Serena relaxed and started again.

Serena then pulled off Amy&#146;s shirt.  Then kissing her chest around her 
bra and down her stomach.  Amy felt her breasts harden.  She started 
to feel something between her legs.  A heat which she never felt 
before.  (Sorry, but offended by female love scenes, get out now.  
Last warning.  No more interruptions until love scene finished.).  
Serenea&#146;s kisses came back up he stomach then her chest. Finally 
stopping at her bra. Amy Reached to undo it.  Serena shook her head. 
Amy then moaned.  Serena kissed Amy all along the outside of her bra.  
When Amy couldn&#146;t take it anymore.  Serena undid her bra.  It had felt 
so constricting.  Serena then licked one finger than started tracing 
circles around Amy&#146;s nipple.  As Amy was heating up from that .  
Serena than licked her other finger and started on her other breast.  
Amy was both pleasured and suffering.  The feeling between her legs 
got worse.

&#147;Serena please.&#148;

Serena looked at her.  Amy pointed to her pussy.

&#147;Here.&#148;

Serena nodded.

She licked one nipple than the other.  Then pinched them lightly.  Amy 
nearly screamed.  Serena then undid Amy&#146;s pants.  Amy tried to help 
her.  But Serena shook her head.  This was almost torture, but it felt 
so good.  Serena too felt turned on, but wanted to make Amy feel good 
first.  Serena kissed Amy around her thighs.

&#147;Please.&#148;

Serena then started gently kneading Amy&#146;s womanhood though her panties 
while kissing her.  Amy felt a big something but held it back.  She 
wanted to enjoy this as long as possible yet Serena was taking too 
much time.  Amy then whimpered and moved her hand to her pussy.  
Serena nodded.  Serena pulled her panties down slowly while licking 
and kissing each bit of exposed skin.  It was taking forever.  Finally 
they were down Amy pulled them down the rest of the way and kicked 
them off.  Serena then started licking, ever so slowly.   

&#147;Ohhhh.&#148;

&#147;&#148;Faster, onegai,..faster.&#148;

Serena then moved her mouth to Amy&#146;s clit and being merciful, took two 
fingers and started pumping inside her.  The licking and fingers were 
almost too much, but then Serena slowed down. 

&#147;No.&#148;

Serena nodded and while lightly nibbling on Amy&#146;s clit moved her 
fingers faster.  

&#147;Oh.  Ohhh.  Yes.&#148;

Serena then slowed down her fingers.&#148;.

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Amy, if I continue, you won&#146;t be a virgin, anymore.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;  Amy said, half out of it.

&#147;You won&#146;t be a virgin.&#148;

&#147;Uhhn.&#148;

&#147;Your, well your something will break.&#148;

&#147;My uhhhn, hymen.&#148;

&#147;Yeah that&#146;s it.&#148;

&#147;I DON&#146;T GIVE A FUCK.&#148;

&#147;Ames?&#148;

&#147;ONEGAI!&#148;

&#147;Hai.&#148;

&#147;While talking Serena had continued pleasuring Amy.  Finally she felt 
it coming.  It felt so good.

&#147;Faster.&#148;

&#147;Serena nodded.&#148;

Amy&#146;s hymen broke and she screamed:

&#147;SERmpph&#148;:  As Serena kissed her while she came.

&#147;Oh,oh oh,h,h,h,h&#148;:  She panted.

&#147;Amy.&#148;

&#147;That was, OmiGod, I feel so.&#148;

&#147;Relax.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, need a minute.&#148;

Amy basked for a while in the glow of climax.

Serena then turned Amy over.     

&#147;What.&#148;

&#147;Trust me.&#148;

Serena left for a minute or two.  Then started cleaning Amy&#146;s 
beautiful posterior.

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;Stay calm, but you&#146;re bleeding.&#148;

Amy almost turned over, but Serena stopped her.

&#147;It&#146;s natural, let me clean you up.&#148;

&#147;Natural.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re not a virgin anymore.&#148;

&#147;But.?&#148;

&#147;I tried to tell you.&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;If you&#146;re mad, after you&#146;ve stopped bleeding, I&#146;ll leave.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;.&#148;

&#147;No, stay, it&#146;s just..&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;m glad, it was you.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

Laughter:  &#147;That you made me a woman.&#148;

&#147;Me too.&#148;

Serena cleaned Amy up and stopped the bleeding.  She then got Amy off 
the bed for a moment and changed the sheets.  Then put them in the 
laundry basket.

&#147;Those need to be washed Ames.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t want your mom to see them.&#148;

&#147;Serena, your still dressed.&#148;

&#147;I know.&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll see.&#148;

There was a knock at the door.

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll take care of it.&#148;

Amy could hear Serena talking to Mrs. Ferguson, her neighbor.  When 
Mrs. Ferguson said she wanted to come in.  Amy said loudly;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148;

Mrs.Ferguson said she&#146;d be back tomorrow to check on Amy.

&#147;Serena?&#148;

&#147;I told her you stubbed your toe.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#146;

&#147;You were pretty loud&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;How did you know.&#148;

&#147;I read a lot of romance novels.&#148;

&#147;Wait, you don&#146;t mean&#133;?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll tell you tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;Rest now.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Trust me, you need it.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Take a few deep breaths.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

Amy did.

&#147;Whoa, I&#146;m, I am so fatigued.&#148;

&#145;Tired, right.&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Go to sleep.&#148;

&#147;Wait.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;I want to see you naked.&#148;

&#147;But&#133;Okay.  Just don&#146;t make fun of me.&#148;

&#147;What I&#146;d never do that.&#148;

Serena started stripping.  Finally she was naked.

&#147;Wow.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t think I&#146;m fat&#148;

Amy almost laughed but stopped herself.

Serena had a tiny bit of fat on her belly but it complemented her.  
Amy looked her down from her beautiful face down to her toes then 
slowly up.

&#147;Amy!&#148;

&#147;Sorry.&#148;

She had full hips, then her glance stopped at her breasts.

Serena crossed her arms over them.

&#147;Onegai, let me see.&#148;

Serena uncrossed her arms and looked at her toes.

&#147;There so&#133; big.&#148;

&#147;There too big.&#148;

&#147;No, they&#146;re perfect.&#148;

&#147;You think so.&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Rei would call them udders.&#148;

&#147;WHAT!&#148;

&#147;Whoa&#148;:  Amy said  when Serena didn&#146;t say anything  

&#147;She says all I need is udders to be as big as a cow.&#148;

Amy thought back, she had never noticed Serena had big breasts.

&#147;I thought they were smaller.&#148;

&#147;I wear clothes which make them look small, and I wear a tight bra.&#148;

&#147;Whoa.&#148;

&#147;I envy you Amy.&#148;

You have perfect breasts.&#148;

Laughter

&#147;What?!&#148;

&#147;I envy you.  I am extremely jealous of your breasts.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;d like beasts your size&#133;.How..how-

&#147;38C.&#148;

&#147;Wow.&#148;

&#147;Uhmm?&#148;

&#147;33B.&#148;

&#147;Oh,&#148;

Serena came toward the bed.

&#147;Uhmm.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t want to sleep together.&#148;

&#147;Didn&#146;t we just&#133;&#148;

&#147;I mean sleep.&#148;

&#147;Oh, but what about my mom.&#148;

&#147;Set an alarm.&#148;

&#147;Right&#148;:  Amy did.

Serena got into bed with Amy.

Amy started to play with, then suckle Serena&#146;s breasts.

&#147;Tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Aren&#146;t you tired.&#148;

&#147;Well I can, yawn, still yawn do-

&#147;Go to sleep.&#148;

&#147;Affiryawnmative.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

Okay, done for now.  All ideas,which are not Naoko&#146;s within this 
Fanfic are mine, please do not steal them, nor my writing style.  I 
will try to finish Amy making love to Serena.  After that, I may have 
to make this more than one part.  Please do not edit without 
permission..  If there are mistakes.  Tell me and then I will say 
whether or not to fix them.  I could end it now.  But there&#146;s more to 
come.  Laughter.  Onegai means please and arigotou is thank you.&#148;.  
Okay, break time.  Ja matta/see you later. 

Okay, break over.  Hope you&#146;re enjoying this so far.  Once again my 
Email is:  kwyp@lycos.com.  I&#146;m having a bit of trouble with my 
server.  So if I don&#146;t get back to you right away, my apologies in 
advance.  Now on with the Fanfic.  My apologies, I&#146;m starting to sound 
like Jackie Chan&#146;s uncle here.  In the cartoon.  One more thing:  The 
preceeding was set in the second season of Sailor Moon R.  When Ann 
and Alan were attacking and Darien lost his memories about Serena.  
NOW, on with the Fanfic.


For a while Amy stayed up and held Serena, then finally in her arms, 
she fell asleep.  At 6A.M. the alarm went off.

&#147;Wuzzat.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s alright Serena, go back to sleep.&#148;

&#147;ZZZ.&#148;

&#147;Usually Amy was able to study in the morning.  She was distracted by 
thoughts of Serena.
&#145;Get a hold of yourself.  I have to study.&#146;

Ten minutes later Amy was finally able to get to it.

Two hours later.

&#147;Time to wake up.&#148;

&#147;sleepy, need sleep.&#148;

&#147;Serena.&#148;

&#147;ZZZ&#148;

&#147;You asked for it.&#148;

Amy got into bed with Serena.  She held her in her arms

&#147;MMMhhn.&#148;

Amy then started nuzzling Serena&#146;s neck.

&#147;that feels so good, Ames?&#148;

&#147;Wake up.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t wanna.&#148;

&#147;Fine.&#148;

Amy then started playing with Serena&#146;s breasts.  Serena was still 
naked.  

&#147;Amy.&#148;

Amy stopped rubbing Serena&#146;s breasts and reached one hand downwards.

&#147;HuMmph.&#148;

As Serena was waking up.  Amy kissed her full on the mouth

&#147;MMMMM.&#148;

Amy released her mouth, but let her hand keep exploring.

&#147;Okay, okay, I&#146;m up.&#148;

Amy pulled her hand up.

&#147;I didn&#146;t say to stop.&#148;

&#147;Serena, it&#146;s time to study.&#148;

&#147;Joke, right.&#148;

&#147;You told your mom we would study.  Now it&#146;s time.&#148;

&#147;But&#133;&#148;:  Serena looked at the clock.

&#147;It&#146;s 8A.M., and it&#146;s a Saturday.  C&#146;mmmmooooon.&#148;

&#147;Nope.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;My turn to torture you.&#148;

Serena looked sad.

&#147;Was&#133;was it torture?&#148;

&#147;Whaat.  No, of course not.  But you took so long.&#148;

&#147;So long?&#148;

&#147;To make me&#133;.&#148;

&#147;Come.&#148;

&#147;Come?&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Well so now it&#146;s my turn.&#148;

&#147;To?&#148;

&#147;To teach you something.&#148;

&#147;Well jump in.&#148;

&#147;No, to study.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;The other thing&#133;.  That comes later.&#148;

&#147;Yesss.&#148;

&#147;Later, after we study.&#148;

&#147;damn.&#148;:  Serena whispered

&#147;Get dressed and we can eat too.&#148;

&#147;You know how to treat a girl Amy.&#148;

&#147;Studying too.&#148;

&#147;Sadist.&#148;

&#147;What.&#148;

&#147;Tell you later.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll have to tell me about that other thing too.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Your romance novels.&#148;

Serena blushed.

&#147;I can&#146;t believe your blushing now.&#148;

&#147;Hey!&#148;:  Serena threw a pillow at her.

&#147;Get dressed then breakfast.&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

So Serena and Amy started studying for a while.  Then:

&#147;What&#146;s 6 times 6.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#147;Serena, we just studied that.&#148;

&#147;I know, I know.&#148;

Instead of giving up.  Or becoming exasperated.  Amy asked.

&#147;What&#146;s 6 times 1?&#148;

&#147;6.&#148;

&#147;6 times 2.&#148;

&#147;Uh, twelve?&#148;

&#147;Right, now what&#146;s the number they&#146;re both multiplied by.&#148;

&#147;6&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

&#147;Now what&#146;s 12-6?&#148;

&#147;6&#148;

&#147;Correct.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s 6 times 6.&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know.&#148;

&#145;No, Amy, she can do this&#133;Just be patient.&#146;

&#147;6 times 1 is 6, and 6 times 2 is 12.  So what&#146;s 6 times 3.&#148;

&#147;I&#133; 18.&#148;

&#147;YES.&#148;

&#147;Now Serena, do what you did , except go up to thirty-six.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

Serena thought for about two minutes then:

&#147;6 times 6 is&#133;

&#147;Yes?.&#148;

&#147;Thirty-six.&#148;

&#147;YES.&#148;:  Amy jumped into Serena&#146;s arms.:  &#147;You did it, I knew you 
could.&#148;

&#147;Yeah, hey I did math.  Woohoo.&#148;

&#147;Serena got up and did a little dance.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re not done yet.&#148;

&#147;Oh.&#148;

&#147;You don&#146;t have to stop.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Dancing.&#148;

&#147;Serena blushed.&#148;

&#147;Amy!&#148;

&#147;I&#133;I love it when you blush.&#148;

Serena blushes a deeper shade of red.

&#147;&#133;&#133;&#148;:  Serena

They studied for a little while longer.  Amy took the time to explain 
things and Serena actually understood.

Amy looked at the clock.

&#147;It&#146;s time.&#148;

&#147;Time.&#148;

&#147;You know.&#148;

You actually scheduled it?&#148;

&#147;Serena I schedule everything.&#148;

&#147;We&#146;re going to have to do something about that habit.&#148;

&#147;Hmm.&#148;

&#147;Ames, we have to talk about something after.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;After. Please.&#148;

&#147;Hhhh, fine.&#148;

They made their way to Amy&#146;s bedroom.  Once inside.

&#147;Serena, would you&#133;Can you?&#148;

&#147;Whatever you please.&#148;

&#147;Would you&#133;  strip for me.&#148;

&#147;Whoa&#133;Sure.&#148;

&#147;And it&#146;s your turn this morning.&#148;

&#147;For what?&#148;

Amy blushes:  &#148;You know.&#148;

Serena blushes:  &#147;Oh.&#148;,then starts stripping

Okay that&#146;s it for now.  I&#146;ll try to finish this soon.  I don&#146;t know 
how good the strip tease will be, so if it&#146;s bad, well it&#146;s bad.  
Arigotou, minna san.  Ja matta.

Ohayo minna san.  Back again.  This, I think is going to be the last 
piece of part one.  Well, when I get up to the beginning of the 
Negamoon attack.  When Renee first appears, or does she?  You&#146;ll see, 
now on with this.

Serena started with her socks  Taking them off slowly.

&#147;Hey.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m taking my time.  You&#146;ll enjoy it more.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

&#147;Serena then moved on to her pants, taking off one leg then the other.  
She did a slow dance.  Hiding her legs behind the pants until she 
threw them off to the side.  Then her sweater, doing the same thing 
with it.  She was now in her t-shirt and panties.  Amy was getting 
turned on by this, she almost couldn&#146;t wait.  But years of being 
patient in school.  Years of being made fun of and holding back her 
anger had taught her the wisdom of not rushing.  Serena then slowly 
rolled up her t-shirt.  Taking it over her head.  Finally, she was in 
her bra and panties.  Amy could see red marks where the bra bit into 
her.

&#147;Serena?&#148;

&#147;Yeah?.&#148;

&#145;Would you consider wearing a bra more your size?&#148;

&#147;But Rei would-

&#147;We&#146;ll talk about it later.&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

Serena got back to her stripping.  Slowly taking off her bra.  Her 
breasts almost flew out of it.  Amy&#146;s breath caught in her throat.

&#147;Daijobou?&#148;

&#147;Yeah I&#146;m alright. Just keep going.&#148;

&#147;As you wish&#133; mistress.&#148;

&#147;Hey!&#148;

&#147;Gomen.&#148;:  Serena then continued, moving around in nothing but her 
panties.  Then slowly taking them off and throwing them to Amy.&#148;

&#147;Amy picked them up and smelled them.&#148;

&#147;AMES!&#148;

&#147;You have a nice smell.&#148;

&#147;Uh, thanks.&#148;

&#147;Come here please.&#148;

&#147;Uhm, what about your mom?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll set the alarm.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;ll do?&#148;

&#147;She&#146;ll be here at twelve, it&#146;s ten-thirty, I&#146;ll set it for 
eleven-thirty.&#148;

&#147;We only have an hour?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;ll be sufficient time.&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Just&#133; please come.&#148;

&#147;kay.&#148;

Serena went over and lay down on the bed.  Amy then got up and got 
undressed.  She then straddled Serena (If straddled isn&#146;t the right 
word, please inform.).  

Amy started to move her hand downward.

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;&#133;..&#148;

&#147;Kiss me first.&#148;

Amy kissed her hard.

&#147;Softer, but, just as strong.&#148;

Amy kissed her again.  Serena enjoyed it.

&#147;Now go down to my breasts.&#148;

Amy was taking off her bra then:

&#147;Kiss me around my chest.&#148;

&#147;Who&#146;s making love to who here?&#148;

&#147;Amy, I just want you to-

&#147;We don&#146;t have much time.&#148;

&#147;&#133;&#133;  I&#146;m just trying to-

&#147;I&#146;m sorry I&#146;ve never done this before.&#148;

&#147;Don&#146;t worry I&#146;ll walk you-

&#147;Just let me do it my way.&#148;

&#147;Okay.&#148;

Amy then did as Serena instructed kissing around her bra, then took it 
off.

She nibbled on one nipple while rubbing and pinching the other. 

&#147;Oooohhhh.&#148;

She then licked her way to Serena&#146;s nether regions.

It wasn&#146;t bad, but Serena knew Amy could do better.  The licking 
strokes were too long but nice.

Amy then started licking Serena&#146;s womanhood.

&#147;Slower.&#148;

Amy went slower.

Then as Serena did last night Amy started licking her clit and put two 
fingers inside and started pumping.

&#147;Ohhh, Amy&#133;&#148;

&#147;Yeah.&#148;

&#147;Please, uhhh, please don&#146;t break my hymen,&#133; and go slower.&#148;

&#147;But.&#148;

&#147;Please!&#148;

&#147;Hhh, alright.&#148;

So Amy went slower and was careful of Serena&#146;s hymen.

&#147;Ohhh, yeeessss.&#148;

Serena then put her hands on Amy&#146;s breasts.

&#147;No.&#148;

&#147;Why, uhhhnn.&#148;

&#147;Today is your turn.&#148;

&#147;oh, ooohhhh.&#148;

So, Serena took her hands off.

&#147;Yeeesss, almost there.&#148;

The alarm then went off

Amy turned it off.

&#147;AMY!!!&#148;

&#147;We have to get ready.&#148;

&#147;ONEGAI!&#148;

Amy had to fight years of following schedules, but she then put her 
fingers back in and continued,

&#147;Ames, hhh, hhh,.&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ll have to, uhhhhn, muffle me.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;My mouth, with your hand or your, ooooohhhhh, mouth.&#148;

&#147;Right.&#148;

It took Serena ten more minutes, then:  &#147;Ammpph.&#148;

Amy had put her hand over Serena&#146;s mouth, then quicklly removed her 
hand and kissed her as she was climaxing.

Finally Serena stopped.

&#147;That was great.&#148;

&#147;We have to get ready.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

My mom&#146;s coming in nineteen minutes.

Two quick showers later and hurrying,  Then Amy doing something in the 
bathroom:  Amy and Serena were on the couch studying.

Click

&#147;Hi mom.&#148;

&#147;Hi Mrs. Mizuno.&#148;

Okay, this next part I&#146;m going to rush a bit.  Ohayo means morning and 
minna san is everybody.

Mrs. Ferguson was at the door with Amy&#146;s mother. Amy told them she 
stubbed her toe. Then showed them a bandaged toe.  Serena had a quiet 
sigh of relief.

&#145;So that&#146;s what she was doing in the bathroom.&#146;:  Serena thought.

Serena later left after everything was clear.  Before she left, she 
reminded Amy to do her laundry.

Time passed.  Ann and Alan were redeemed and things were wonderful for 
Amy until:

&#147;Tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Tomorrow I&#146;m telling Darien.  I won&#146;t tell him it&#146;s you.&#148;

&#147;But&#133;&#148;

&#147;He deserves to know.&#148;

&#147;But what if?&#148;

&#147;If he can&#146;t accept it, then I&#146;ve lost him.&#148;

&#147;You mean?&#148;

&#147;I love both of you&#133;..If he (tears), if he can&#146;t accept us&#133;Then he 
doesn&#146;t&#133;I don&#146;t know&#148;

&#147;Deserve you.&#148;

&#147;No, I&#146;m the one cheating on him.&#148;

&#147;Are you dating.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not sure, I think tomorrow&#146;s our first date.&#148;

&#147;Then it isn&#146;t cheating.&#148;

&#147;I know, yet&#133; but I have to tell him.&#148;

Amy and Serena made love that night with more passion then before.  
Amy to try not to think about how she felt about Serena telling 
Darien.  Serena to forget about tomorrow.  

Thet had decided not to tell the others.  Serena had explained that 
the world could end if the scouts split up, so for now, it had to stay 
a secret from the other scouts.&#148;

The next day, Serena and Darien had finished their ride on the lake 
and were getting ready to kiss.

&#145;After this kiss I&#146;ll tell him.&#146;:  She thought.

Okay you know what&#146;s coming don&#146;t you.  If you don&#146;t, you may hate me 
for a few minutes.

Serena and Darien were just starting to kiss when:  A pink haired girl 
fell from the sky, landed on Serena&#146;s head and met lips with Darien.

She then jumped to the ground and said:

&#147;Give me the Silver Crystal.&#148;

Sorry, couldn&#146;t resist  Laughter.  Gomen

Later, Darien had broken it off with Serena, she hadn&#146;t had a chance 
to tell him.  For Serena, she wondered if Darien were in love with 
Renee (Read the manga, this is what she asks Darien in it.).  Amy 
wondered if Darien knew.

Serena was heartbroken, fortunately, she had Amy to comfort her.  For 
Amy she was sad and happy.  Sad that Serena was hurting.  Happy that 
Darien and Serena had broken up.  She felt guilty, but couldn&#146;t help 
feeling happy.  The other thing was, Serena sometimes called to Darien 
in her sleep.  At other times she would whisper:  &#147;Please don&#146;t leave 
me Amy.&#148;

Although Serena still hurt, they were happy together.  Except, when 
Amy wasn&#146;t around Serena would try to get Darien back.  Amy also 
noticed that Rei and Mina may be starting to suspect.  But things were 
still beautiful, except their other new problem, their new enemy.

------------------------------------------------------------

Okay, part one done.  To be continued.  Sorry I rushed this part and 
left things hanging, but other commitments call.  I&#146;ll try to start 
part two next weekend.  Hope you enjoyed this.  Again, sorry about 
rushing the end.  Ja matta minna san.</pre>
