<p>Usagi shivered underneath her blankets, and coughed occasionally.  Although she didn’t argue, she was ordered by her mom to stay in bed  the whole day. The whole week had taken so much out of her, but she was  grateful for being able spending Christmas with her family and friends. <em>Especially Mamoru. I wonder if he’s landed safely</em>, she thought.  He had left yesterday morning, and he was reluctant to leave Japan.  Usagi tried her best to hide the fact that she was started to catch  something when she was at the airport. After an embrace from his  girlfriend, Mamoru spoke to Makoto and she drove Usagi home after  noticing that her friend was not feeling well.</p>
<p>“Just a cold, probably from this weather,” reassured Usagi.</p>
<p><em>Baka, Usagi. You know very well it’s not a cold.</em> She shivered more as she tried to get as much warmth from the blanket.  Usagi looked outside her window and saw that it was a beautiful day.  She sighed from disappointment.</p>
<p>“Luna. It’s a lovely day and yet I’m stuck at home. Not fair.”</p>
<p>The  small plushy cat jumped on the foot of Usagi’s bed and sat there. She  knew that Usagi missed Mamoru terribly, and it was just a day without  him.</p>
<p>“Not today Usagi-chan. You need your rest.” Before the odango-haired girl could respond her mother came in.</p>
<p>“Something the matter Usagi? I heard you talking to someone.”</p>
<p>“No. I was just thinking out loud that’s all.”</p>
<p>Her mother looked suspicious and finally said, “Mako-chan is here to see you.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked at the entrance and found Makoto standing before her. She sat next to Usagi and placed a package on the table.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan! I was getting bored being stuck here all day.”</p>
<p>Makoto  nodded, “I figured, but I made you some soup. It’s actually one of my  specialties. I made it when Ami-chan was sick and she felt better the  next day.”</p>
<p>Usagi sat up, but fell back down. “I guess this dizziness is not helping.”</p>
<p>Makoto placed her hand on Usagi’s forehead.</p>
<p>“You’re burning up. Hang on, I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>She left the room and Usagi waited.</p>
<p>“So how is everyone?” she asked as Makoto walked back inside.</p>
<p>“Well,  Rei is at the shrine as usual, and Ami-chan is spending some time with  her mother. Minako is always busy at the studio. Here.” Makoto said as  she placed the cold towel on her friend’s forehead. After a few  minutes, Makoto helped Usagi up and began to feed her some soup.</p>
<p>“I always love your cooking Mako-chan. It is always the best. You should teach me someday.”</p>
<p>Usagi  finished the bowl and lay down again. Makoto stayed a while to keep  Usagi company. She knew how boring it can get when you’re stuck in bed  all day. Makoto got up and began an effort to cheer up her friend. So  she began to sing one of Usagi’s favorite Aino Minako songs. She  grabbed Luna and began to dance with the little plushy as Usagi clapped  along to the music. Then Makoto made a rather good impression of an  annoyed Rei, and Usagi laughed. After a while, Usagi slowly drifted  into sleep and started to snore.</p>
<p>“Usagi?” asked Makoto as noticed  that it got quiet. She felt Usagi’s forehead and noticed that the fever  went down a few notches, and Makoto smiled. <em>Probably dreaming about Mamoru again.</em> She slowly snuck out the room and quietly closed the door before heading out.</p>
<hr />
Rei  kicked a can as she walked down the street. For the first time in ages,  she finished her chores rather early and decided to take a walk. It was  a beautiful day and she wanted to take as much advantage of it as she  could. Rei loved the feeling of the leaves crunching underneath her  shoes every time she took a step. She passed by the church where her  mother was buried, and where she personally met Minako. Rei peeked in,  and it seemed empty. Finally, she decided to walk inside and sit on the  pews. She closed her eyes and listened to nothing but the wind blowing  outside and the trees rustling. Then she heard someone giggle.
<p>“Funny, how we always seem find our way back here.”</p>
<p>Rei opened her eyes and turned around to see Minako standing nearby the entrance.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan. What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“This always seemed to be the place where I could be alone.” Minako then settled next to Rei.</p>
<p>“I guess old habits die hard.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember Riki?”</p>
<p>“You mean Taro? How could I forget, we were both competing at the time, and you bought a lot of dog food.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, and this was the first place where a certain someone did not know who I was.”</p>
<p>Rei winced. “Gomen, I already told you I hated television.”</p>
<p>“So why are <em>you</em> here Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>“Something told me to be here, I don’t know what it was but-”</p>
<p>Before  Rei could finish her sentence, they both heard footsteps behind them  and turned around. Makoto stopped in her footsteps as she recognized  the two girls seated in the church. She waved as she began to walk  towards them</p>
<p>“Wow, talk about coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Hey Mako-chan. Why are you here too?”</p>
<p>“Mainly  to pray, I mean that’s what people do in church right?” She began to  kneel. “I visited Usagi earlier. She’s not feeling well today. I’m  guessing from the cold weather, she’s catching the flu.”</p>
<p>Minako and Rei looked at Makoto, both with worried expressions.</p>
<p>“Is she alright? “ asked Minako.</p>
<p>Makoto nodded, “Her fever seemed to have gone down before I left.”</p>
<p>Rei sighed in relief. However, Minako began to feel a little suspicious. <em>Usagi did over exert herself this whole week.</em></p>
<p>Meanwhile at the Tsukino residence, Usagi slowly opened her eyes. Her head began to throb and she looked around her room. <em>I must have fallen asleep while Mako-chan was here.</em> Feeling a little embarrassed when she imagined Makoto tip-toeing out her room, Usagi tried to sit up.</p>
<p>“Luna.”</p>
<p>The little plushy hopped to her side, “Usagi?”</p>
<p>“How long was I asleep?”</p>
<p>“A few hours.”</p>
<p>Usagi  looked outside the window, and saw that the sun was starting to set.  She was saddened by the fact that she was unable to enjoy the outdoors  for the whole day. Her headache had begun to get worse and she shut her  eyes tightly. <em>Not again. When is this ever going to end? </em>Usagi  heard her mother walk in, but could not decipher the words she was  saying. She was more concentrated on trying to sooth the now unbearable  headache. Suddenly her everything around her turned dark.</p>
