The assembly hall of an American musical university is not the most 
luxurious or extravagant place to host a concert and &#150; compared to doing 
a gig with Three Lights back in those days &#150; it could seem like a rather 
trivial experience, but as Michiru, from her position backstage, lets 
her gaze roam over the many rows of chairs spreading out in half-circles 
like ripples of water in front of the orchestral pit, she thinks that 
this could very well be the most important performance she&#39;s done yet.

In the back of the room, half-hidden in the shadows, she can make out 
the camera crew and their enormous cameras, moving first to one side 
then to the other. It is an intimate concert &#150; only 200 
especially-invited guests having received tickets in addition to the 500 
students attending the school &#150; made into a public event in celebration 
of Valentine&#39;s Day and the love it represents.

Love. In selection. The thought alone makes Michiru smile ironically.

&quot;And now, please welcome our next guests! The original composer of our 
next number &quot;The Love of a Maiden&quot;; world-famous violinist Miss Michiru 
Kaioh, accompanied by her cousin Miss Haruka Tenoh at the piano, sharing 
the spotlight with our very own Miss Michelle Corr who is playing the 
harp. Having come all the way from Tokyo, Japan...&quot;

&quot;World-famous, eh?&quot; Haruka whispers in her ear while the male host 
continues his presentation of them, one of her hands resting against the 
small of Michiru&#39;s back, warm and comforting through the thin fabric of 
her white silk dress.

&quot;Envious of my fame?&quot; Michiru teases, reaching out to brush some 
invisible, non-existent dust of Haruka&#39;s tux-clad shoulder (an excuse to 
touch), the light grey colour of the material reminding her of her 
lover&#39;s eyes on early mornings, still caught in the state between being 
asleep and conscious of having woken up. The colour of the air when it 
rains.

&quot;I prefer motor sports over music,&quot; is Haruka&#39;s answer, straightening up 
and pulling slightly at the lapels of her jacket to show Michiru that 
she doesn&#39;t need help in fixing herself up, &quot;which is probably for the 
best, ne?&quot; Smiling crookedly, she tugs at a wisp of aquamarine hair that 
has fallen into Michiru&#39;s face, their fingertips brushing as Michiru 
reaches up to push it behind one ear.

It wasn&#39;t until Haruka met Michiru that she began really expressing her 
talents on the piano. She has been playing since she was barely 5 years 
old, of course, but for some reason she had come to perceive the black 
and white keys as a war zone. Having never been told the entire story, 
Michiru does have a general idea of it being strongly related to a 
father-daughter issue, since Haruka&#39;s father had seemingly thought it 
would make his daughter act more like a typical girl to engage in an art 
as feminine as playing the piano. After Michiru re-introduced her to the 
concept of playing with the heart, though, Haruka has started to enjoy 
the possibilities of her instrument. Much to her girlfriend&#39;s delight.

&quot;That&#39;s rather humble of you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Michiru asks in a chitchatting 
voice, her smile coy.

The girl standing in front of them &#150; the harpist, Michelle Corr-san, was 
it? Michiru has seen her before, but is unable to place her in any 
context &#150; sends them a weird look over her shoulder and Michiru senses 
the slight blush creeping into Haruka&#39;s cheeks only because she is so 
used to being around the blonde. Coughing slightly in her typical show 
of embarrassment (the words she was about to utter forgotten), Haruka 
steps back, her expensive Italian shoes not as audible and loud against 
the floorboards as Michiru&#39;s high-heeled sandals.

It is not because Haruka feels ashamed by their relationship &#150; as such 
her sexuality is no more of a problem to her than it is to Michiru &#150; but 
Michiru has learned along the way that her partner is a highly private 
person, not much for sharing what she considers elements of her personal 
life with anybody outside the small circle of confidants that she has. 
In Haruka&#39;s mind, romantic issues are more often than not included in 
that category of information.

Allowing Haruka a moment to collect herself, Michiru turns her attention 
towards the stage.

&quot;So, give them all a warm reception! Miss Kaioh, Miss Tenoh, and Miss 
Corr; if you ladies please?&quot; the host laughs at the end of his opening 
speech, his voice echoing between the walls and making the many 
microphones screech faintly.

They are applauded by the audience as they walk on stage together, 
Corr-san two steps in front of them, already heading for her beautiful, 
golden harp whose colour becomes her thick, orange-red hair well. Coming 
to a halt next to the grand piano placed in the middle of the stage, 
Michiru catches a glimpse of Vladimir-san and Beatrice-san leaving the 
podium hand in hand. Looking at Haruka out the corner of her eye, 
waiting for her &quot;cousin&quot; to settle in at the grand piano, she lets her 
beloved violin come to a rest on her left shoulder and twirls the bow 
with her fingers a couple of times to loosen the muscles in her hand.

Placing the left side of her jaw on the chinrest and gripping the neck 
of her violin delicately, Michiru turns towards the piano and gives 
Haruka a small nod, signalling for her to start. She watches the 
tomboyish girl close her eyes, moving her fingers over the keys 
curiously, as if searching for the right sounds. The first time Michiru 
had heard Haruka play the piano, she had played it perfectly &#150; not a 
single note gone wrong &#150; but without any kind of feeling. Now she plays 
based on feeling alone. Flawless it&#39;s not; if one listens closely there 
are mistakes to pick up on, but the mood of Michiru&#39;s music has never 
been clearer or more pleasant to listen to. That&#39;s the charm that Haruka 
adds to it which makes Michiru love it so much.

Hearing the first, hesitant notes fluttering in the air, she gives a 
similar, short nod to Michelle-san. As the student sits with the harp 
between her legs, the frame resting along her shoulder, her long fingers 
already ready to pluck the strings, Michiru realises where she&#39;s seen 
her before. She was the girl, the tall redhead, rushing into the 
assembly hall just before Michiru had her clash with Reynolds-sensei.

Which reminds her of...

Calling the first long tones of her own instrument&#39;s part of &quot;Shojo no 
Koi&quot; &#150; a feeble, dancing sound &#150; out of her violin by drawing the bow 
gently over the strings, Michiru searches the rows of spectators before 
her for the features of Luke-san; features that have edged their way 
into her memory. And just as expected, she locates him on the front row, 
two boys that can no longer be described as teenagers on his right and a 
thin, ghastly woman clinging to him on his left.

Their gazes meet &#150; Michiru the artist and he the judging audient &#150; a 
cruel imitation of a polite smile crossing his face before disappearing 
again as he leans in to whisper something in the ear of the woman beside 
him. His wife, presumably.

Taking a deep breath, Michiru lets herself and the still upset waves 
inside her being calmed by the melody that has appeared underneath the 
soft notes, the three different voices of the three very different 
instruments merging together into one song. One single expression of an 
emotion, Michiru remembers from lonesome evenings in an empty apartment 
in Tokyo.

She closes her eyes and rides the wave of the music. Her music. The 
melody of her heart.

Haruka&#39;s piano is sighing from a subtle, suppressed yearning, Michiru 
easily imagining the elegant hands &#150; long fingers &#150; of her lover 
physically forming the passion that filled 16-year-old Kaioh Michiru in 
the moment she began working on this composition.

It was around the time when Uranus had sought her out in her dreams for 
the first time, confusing Michiru with her familiar eyes that never 
seemed to stay one permanent colour, but changed nuances varying from 
the light shine of fog to the dark foreboding teal of the ocean 
reflecting the late afternoon sky. Something about Sailor Uranus of the 
Silver Millennium had made Michiru think of Tenoh Haruka, but her 
understanding had yet to gain the swift speed of the Senshi of the 
Winds, heiress of her home planet. She hadn&#39;t seen the connection 
immediately, only followed its trail night after night.

In Haruka&#39;s rapid, almost stumbling play, Michiru recognises her own 
unwillingness to give up on the unity with her fate that she felt while 
asleep and hated to have to let go of when waking up &#150; until the day she 
had seen Haruka on the circuit for the first time, recognising the pace 
of Uranus in every of her steps; the weightlessness and precision of her 
movements.

Feeling a small smile tug at the corner of her mouth, Michiru opens her 
ears to Corr-san&#39;s harp next. She has always been fascinated by the 
harp; its fragility and sweet, tinkling sounds that can seem almost 
indistinct amongst the hundreds of other overwhelming sounds of a 
symphony. Nonetheless, it is there with a certain sort of vigour in all 
its gentleness &#150; an energy that reflects Michiru&#39;s own complexity.

Feather-soft on the outside, but just as unbreakable as the most 
precious diamond on the inside.

Yes, this is the characteristics of the being Michiru has become after 
she awakened as Sailor Neptune; whole at last as she was eventually 
reunited with her companion from the past. A destiny faithful to 
Princess Uranus&#39; words about Michiru finding her again, but knowing her 
&quot;by another name&quot;.

Turning to face the blonde woman seated in front of the piano, Michiru 
drags out the last light-hearted moments of the piece, the strings of 
her violin vibrating and making the tones break into glass-like pieces 
as they soar through the room supported by the invisible wings of atomic 
vibrations. Relaxing her shoulders, Haruka straightens up and meets 
Michiru&#39;s eyes with a satisfied half-smile revealed in her bluish grey 
gaze. Even though she has no possibility of knowing the journey through 
time that their ensemble has taken the cerulean blue-eyed Ocean Senshi 
on, she does seem to instinctively pick up on the strong affection the 
experience has raised within her undercover partner, currently cousin.

Michiru puts her violin down on top of the stylish, black piano. It is 
true that between the two of them, she is the one with the highest 
degree of inbred perceptiveness, but Haruka has been by her side in many 
situations where Michiru has allowed no one else close. Just like she 
has taught herself how to follow Sailor Uranus&#39; &#150; Haruka&#39;s &#150; speed when 
running, adjusting her pace to that of her lover&#39;s, so has Haruka 
learned little by little to read Michiru&#39;s feelings and thoughts. There 
is very little that Michiru thinks she could successfully hide from 
Tenoh Haruka at this point in their relationship; their life &#150; their 
mission.

She has stopped wanting to try a long time ago.

Relishing in the enthusiastic applause from the guests, Michiru bows 
gracefully and waits for Haruka to join her before turning her attention 
to the female host &#150; a young, pretty woman with pink hair hanging in a 
waterfall of curls down her back &#150; who is trying to make herself heard 
above the thunder of the many clapping hands.

&quot;Amazing. Simply fantastic. Miss Kaioh; Miss Tenoh. Very touching,&quot; she 
praises them, the way she drags them closer to the edge of the podium 
(into the spotlight) and provides both of them with a mike making 
Michiru think of Minako-chan on one of her idol trips.

&quot;Miss Kaioh, I have to ask,&quot; the female host, Lara-san, says after her 
male colleague who introduced them &#150; a handsome man with a wine-red 
ponytail that bobs up and down as he speaks &#150; has come to a halt next to 
her. Michiru gives her a refined smile, feeling the fabric of Haruka&#39;s 
tuxedo tickle her arm, making her fingers itch to reach out and follow 
the sleeve down to a slim wrist and soft skin of a well-known palm. But 
what is about to follow is all part of their script &#150; and in the script 
Miss Michiru Kaioh complies with the fact that Miss Haruka Tenohis her 
cousin, not her girlfriend, so instead of acting on the urge she folds 
her hands carefully in front of her. &quot;What inspired you to write such a 
poignant piece of music?&quot;

Before her inner eye, Michiru sees the long lines of English letters 
spelling out their conversation, not once leaving a hole for her to be 
the person she normally is when around Haruka. Not once leaving room for 
the truth of the love that they&#39;re here to celebrate.

Her mask still firmly in place, lips parting to form her awaiting line, 
she meets Reynolds-sensei&#39;s cold, arrogant gaze staring up at her from 
his seat in the anonymous crowd. Anyone who is just a little attentive 
will probably be able to distinguish the artificial quality of the 
interview &#150; there&#39;s no spirit to detect, no real interaction. A scam, 
just as he wanted it to be. Patting the bony hand of his wife, Luke-san 
smugly inclines his head at Michiru as a signal of his appreciation; his 
success. Miss Kaioh from Tokyo, Japan, is the cousin of Miss Tenoh; they 
are close because they have grown up together &#150; or so does most of 
America think, because that is what they&#39;ve been told.

Hesitating in answering, Michiru feels the melody of her heart, her 
entire performance, wither and become nothing, veiled in this disguise 
that he&#39;s set up because he thinks them wrong. Unfit for the world he 
lives in; unworthy of being properly depicted.

Inside her, the sea roars in a way Michiru is too well-mannered to let 
her civilian form react on. Sailor Neptune would have found her mirror 
and revealed the true nature of her surroundings &#150; of herself &#150; without 
hesitation, but for now the Deep Aqua Mirror is safely hidden away, and 
there&#39;s only Michiru&#39;s honour being challenged by Reynolds-san&#39;s green 
eyes. That and the soft material of Haruka&#39;s sleeve against the naked 
skin on her arm &#150; offering a kind of different comfort, a touch between 
soul mates, not DNA-matching relatives &#150; are the only truths she has 
been given to work with.

About to turn back to the two hosts and deliver the long speech she is 
supposed to, a speech on the importance of family and the strong bonds 
between friends when times are rough, she catches sight of the two boys 
(men, rather) sitting next to Luke-san. The shortest of them, a 
green-haired, freckled boy, moves his hand subtly to interlace his 
fingers with his neighbour&#39;s. And his neighbour is... Michiru blinks 
twice. The dark purple hair and slightly slanted eyes... she has seen 
that face before. He&#39;s the boy from the picture she was shown back in 
Reynolds-san&#39;s office. Brad Summers, the musician who had specialised in 
her music; the one she had felt an automatic sympathy for because 
something told her he would be able to trace the story of &quot;Shojo no Koi&quot; 
back to its origin in a similar way to how Haruka does.

Pausing at the way Brad-kun sends Luke-sensei a nervous glance as if 
fearing that he will choose this moment to look to his right, quickly 
drawing back his hand from the other boy&#39;s, deliberately not turning his 
head to meet the questioning eyes of his companion, Michiru purses her 
lips. It seems that they have more than music in common, Brad Summers 
and she. They share a love.

The green-haired boy looks hurt at the way everything in Brad-kun&#39;s 
attitude screams &quot;not here&quot;. Letting her gaze sweep from the two youths 
to the man who has apparently raised a glass wall between them with his 
sheer presence, Michiru can&#39;t help feeling sorry for them. Why do they 
let Luke-san dictate to them who to be? Nothing about them is shameful, 
least of all their relationship.

&quot;Michiru?&quot; Haruka says enquiringly, interrupting her frantic thoughts 
with one hand finding its rest on Michiru&#39;s shoulder, calling her back 
to reality; the true nature of reality that Michiru doesn&#39;t need any 
talisman to see.

Why should she let a man like Luke Reynolds tell her how to feel; who to 
be? Michiru is not willing to let him make her feel embarrassed and in 
the wrong about her relationship to Haruka. He has no idea of the 
strength she draws from her love; he knows nothing about Sailor Moon or 
how paradise is meant to be restored not with swords, but with 
understanding and respect. Not Ami-chan, not Rei-chan &#150; none of the 
Senshi perceives themselves as Senshi of War, but Ai no Senshi. Soldiers 
of Love.

Michiru does as well.

&quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry,&quot; she apologises to Lara-san, smiling graciously. 
Michiru meets the worried eyes of first the pink-haired host and then 
her male counterpart for at last to catch Haruka&#39;s gaze, smile turning 
mischievous as her lover &#150; not her cousin &#150; presents her with a raised 
eyebrow at the way Michiru reaches up her own hand to grab hold of 
Haruka&#39;s, still resting on her shoulder. &quot;I got so caught up in the 
story that I forgot about reality.&quot;

The two hosts exchange a worried look. Nothing of what Michiru has said 
can be found in the script. She is stepping out of line, breaking the 
terms they&#39;ve set beforehand, leaving them unprepared for what is to 
come.

&quot;So, what is the story behind the music?&quot; the male host with his nodding 
ponytail &#150; Michiru doesn&#39;t remember his name &#150; asks, desperately trying 
to steer the discussion back on track.

&quot;The truth is...&quot; Facing Haruka, Michiru feels her own eyes adopting the 
gentleness of the still surface of the sea. The English words hang 
between them, translating automatically into the humming sounds of 
Japanese as they pass from Michiru&#39;s lips to Haruka&#39;s ear. Haruka&#39;s face 
doesn&#39;t betray any surprise, her gaze not wavering from Michiru&#39;s as 
they look at each other in the few seconds of silence following the 
fatal beginning of a revelation.

Onegai, Haruka, she thinks silently, the tenseness of her partner&#39;s 
shoulders and the way her fingers wrap around Michiru&#39;s a little more 
tightly giving away the uneasiness she doesn&#39;t want to show, don&#39;t make 
it a question of privacy. Don&#39;t let him have it his way. Don&#39;t let him 
win.

Staring into Haruka&#39;s captivating, dark eyes, she concentrates on these 
broken sentences over and over again, aware that no matter what Sailor 
Mars might think, Michiru doesn&#39;t have any telepathic abilities, but by 
now Haruka knows her so well that she can read her like an open book 
anyway.

Getting Haruka to agree is another thing entirely, though.

Please, she pleads mutely without any indignity or uncertainty. In front 
of Haruka &#150; as one of the few people she has bestowed that particular 
honour upon, if not the only one &#150; Michiru doesn&#39;t fear showing that she 
can come to short on her own. Without Haruka&#39;s permission, she can&#39;t 
lead the final battle against the prejudice they&#39;ve encountered here, 
because she respects the taller, tomboyish woman&#39;s integrity too much to 
press her modesty simply to get at Reynolds-sensei. He&#39;s not worth it. 
But Haruka is.

An apprehension is visible in the corner of Haruka&#39;s mouth, running 
along the straight line of her lips. Confessions have always been her 
Achilles&#39; heel, but this is no confession. What Michiru is asking of her 
has nothing to do with claiming colours or picking teams (announcing any 
kind of belonging). It&#39;s simply... love, and Michiru knows that Haruka 
believes in the power of love just as much as she does herself &#150; if not 
more, because Usagi-chan&#39;s influence is more detectable in the 
short-haired Senshi of the Sky than Haruka would ever willingly admit 
to.

&quot;The truth is,&quot; Michiru repeats, eyes begging Haruka not to draw back, 
&quot;that &#145;Shojo no Koi&#39; is a dedication to my partner.&quot;

All of a sudden &#150; the internal fight of pros and cons visible in her 
grey eyes having come to a conclusion &#150; Haruka&#39;s features soften in a 
way Michiru is normally only entitled to experience when they are alone 
in the confidentiality of their bedroom, just the two of them. Every 
time they&#39;ve told each other &quot;as long as you&#39;re with me&quot; run through 
Michiru&#39;s mind, and she knows that Haruka remembers as well. She has 
never told her lover about the background of her first composition, even 
though they have performed it together on several occasions, because 
this special piece was a shared secret between Princess Uranus and 
Michiru&#39;s heart, but maybe it&#39;s about time...

Because the truth is... Haruka is Uranus by another name, and to Michiru 
there is no distinct border. She loves this girl in front of her in all 
her forms. Nothing and nobody should blemish that with stupid excuses or 
pointing fingers, because the melody of their love is just as vivid and 
beautiful as that of their prince and princess. At one point, it is that 
melody that will help grounding Crystal Tokyo.

&quot;Oh, you have brought your partner here tonight, Miss Kaioh?&quot; Lara-san 
requests curiously, looking over one shoulder to the exit backstage as 
if she expects some mysterious stranger to appear and reveal himself to 
be Michiru&#39;s boyfriend as a pep up surprise in the middle of their show. 
The other host gives her a mocking look, having seemingly figured out 
who Michiru is referring to by the way he shakes his head.

Laughing, Michiru answers: &quot;I have.&quot;

Lara-san looks excited, turning around fully as if to welcome a newcomer 
unto the stage. At this, Haruka rolls her eyes good-naturedly, sighing.

&quot;I choose to believe that you know what you&#39;re doing,&quot; she whispers as 
Michiru lets go of her hand to instead grip the lapels of her jacket, 
leaning up to press the re-defining kiss to lips that no one would ever 
think belonging to a man, no matter what clothes Haruka wears. Her dark 
grey eyes &#150; streaked with dusty green in the scorching light fixed on 
them &#150; flash with the intensity that Michiru fell in love with before 
anything else; the refusal of letting anyone pigeonhole her. Her 
strength is of another kind than Michiru&#39;s, they both know; yet they 
match. Perfectly.

&quot;Ara, don&#39;t you have faith in me?&quot; Michiru asks playfully, still having 
to stand on tiptoe to reach Haruka&#39;s mouth even though her high heels 
level out the difference in height somewhat. Their lips are mere inches 
apart, Michiru&#39;s hands flattened against the soft curve of Haruka&#39;s 
breasts, and Haruka&#39;s fingers brushing along the line of her jaw. Around 
them a hush has fallen, buzzing with a mix of shock and disbelief.

&quot;Always...&quot; says Haruka in a low voice before disregarding the last 
distance between them, hand cupping Michiru&#39;s face gently as their lips 
meet, sharing a slow inhale of the feeling of the other.

&quot;Miss Michiru, should I call for him or will he get...&quot; Lara-san calls 
out, her exclamation coming to an abrupt halt as her attention &#150; Michiru 
pictures &#150; is led to Haruka and herself. &quot;Oh...&quot; Obviously, she &#150; like 
the maid from the previous night &#150; is not used to being faced with two 
kissing &quot;cousins&quot; either.

Their kiss is neither very long nor very erotic. It&#39;s not the kind of 
kiss that would have made them stumble to the bedroom had they been at 
home by themselves. Actually, it&#39;s hardly anything but two pair of lips 
moving tentatively and a short, but never-ending second in which they 
breathe through each other; breathe in each other. Most of all, it&#39;s a 
statement. A point made clear.

They part, Michiru stepping back and running a hand through her hair as 
she turns to the audience, catching the eyes of Reynolds-sensei who 
looks suspiciously pale and &#150; if Michiru isn&#39;t mistaken &#150; very shaken. 
The smile she awards him with is sharp and sweet at the same time, her 
gaze flaring with a fierce pride of having shown him her true power. 
Kaioh Michiru doesn&#39;t accept defeat just like that; she fights until she 
has obtained the closest thing to victory that she can get.

Getting to his feet, Luke-san walks stiffly towards the nearest door, 
the slam of it as it falls closed behind him interrupting the 
uncomfortable silence in the room. Looking back towards the organizers 
seat, she only barely catches sight of the movement of bright green hair 
before the lone sound of clapping hands take over where the bang left 
off. The partner of Brad Summers has stood up, his applause slowly 
followed up by Brad-kun himself. Meeting his wide, dark eyes, Michiru 
smiles warmly at him and in that moment an unspoken understanding 
connects them. The original tune of love.

Slowly others among the audience stand up to join into the clapping and 
the understanding it symbolises.

Next to her, Michiru feels Haruka&#39;s fingertips caress the back of her 
hand soothingly as she states in a stage whisper: &quot;Maybe we should take 
a bow?&quot;

With a giggle, Michiru performs the traditional Japanese curtsy, hands 
against her knees and her aquamarine hair falling around her shoulders 
in waves of ocean-scented strands.

&quot;Arigato, everybody,&quot; she says, her voice not withholding her amusement 
as her show of appreciation mingles with Haruka&#39;s &quot;thank you&quot; uttered in 
a huskier, deeper tone. Straightening up, Michiru &#150; for some reason &#150; 
finds it easy to imagine that Usagi-chan&#39;s face would have beamed with 
happiness if she&#39;d been there... it&#39;s the feeling in the room, she 
realises; it&#39;s been altered...

No one speaks; the applauding continuing unaffected as Michiru walks 
back to the piano to get her violin. Nodding respectfully to the two 
flabbergasted hosts as Haruka and she pass them on their way out, she 
interlaces her fingers with the blonde Senshi&#39;s. Side by side, they make 
their way down from the podium. Just like Vladimir-san and Beatrice-san 
did. No difference at all.

The way it should be, she can&#39;t help thinking.

Looking back over her shoulder, trusting Haruka to lead her steps, 
Michiru finally grasps what it is that has changed from she got here to 
this moment when she&#39;s leaving. The colour of the atmosphere is 
different, now glowing brightly in the exact nuance of their princess&#39; 
Star Seed.

A warm light; shiningly golden from a love that embraces all.</pre>
