<h1>Unchained Melody (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hwingwhit.html">Heath Wingwhit</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/unchained-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>It is nearly midnight. She is face to face with Rei when she opens the 
door. Minako tries to stifle her surprise when Rei brushes past her and 
comes inside. She wonders if Rei comes with an entourage and stares down 
into the hall for her other friends before realizing that Rei has come 
alone. Minako closes the door behind her and turns the lock. Crossing 
her arms across her chest she stares at Rei who looks only slightly more 
aggravated than she usually does.

&quot;It&#39;s a little late to come over,&quot; Minako tells her, going to resume her 
seat on the couch. She indicates that Rei sit but isn&#39;t taken aback when 
she doesn&#39;t. Picking up a magazine with her picture on the cover, Minako 
shows it to Rei. &quot;Have you seen this one yet?&quot;

&quot;You know why I&#39;m here.&quot; Rei barely glances at the magazine; her eyes 
are set on Minako&#39;s intensely.

Mina feigns not knowing and invites Rei to sit once more. Rei does this 
time as if sensing this is the only way to start any sort of proper 
negotiations in terms of talking. &quot;You couldn&#39;t sleep?&quot;

Rei glares. &quot;What you did at the temple, you had no right.&quot;

&quot;What I did?&quot;

&quot;You know what I mean.&quot;

Mina thinks it&#39;s funny that Rei won&#39;t just say it. &quot;You mean when I 
kissed you?&quot; She leans forward when she asks as if daring Rei to pull 
back in any way. When Rei refuses to budge, Minako is impressed. &quot;It 
bothered you so much you had to come here and tell me to my face?&quot;

&quot;It isn&#39;t the sort of thing you talk about over the phone,&quot; Rei says 
fiercely. She deliberates for some moments and Minako watches her, 
waiting her out. Rei takes a breath. &quot;You said you were addressing the 
issue. I don&#39;t understand what you mean.&quot;

Minako sighs and crosses a leg over another staring past the sliding 
glass doors and outside. &quot;You&#39;re joking, aren&#39;t you?&quot; She settles her 
eyes back on Rei who appears to be having a dilemma. &quot;You&#39;re usually 
more talkative. Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve gotten shy now.&quot;

&quot;Had you thought of doing that before?&quot; Rei shakes her head, thinking 
she&#39;s not explaining well enough. &quot;What happened at the shrine,&quot; she 
clarifies.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Minako thinks. At least, she has since recovering her memories 
in this life. The Aino Minako of the past probably hadn&#39;t, but she likes 
to think that she would have been smart enough to figure it out in time. 
&quot;You hadn&#39;t?&quot; There are some moments of silence before she smiles 
lightly. &quot;I&#39;m embarrassed.&quot; But she thinks that Rei is lying. How could 
it not have occurred to her? Not even the slightest of ideas? Minako 
thinks that Rei is either very na&iuml;ve or dense. But it&#39;s probably more of 
the second. Didn&#39;t she have even a little crush on her before she died 
in the past?

&quot;You might have mistaken my actions,&quot; Rei mumbles quietly. &quot;I was only 
worried before. It isn&#39;t like Mamoru and Usagi or Motoki and Makoto.&quot;

Minako drapes an arm along the back of the couch and shifts to look at 
Rei better. &quot;We&#39;re both idols for one, and women.&quot;

Rei doesn&#39;t like this explanation. It seems too oversimplified. &quot;I&#39;m not 
Mars Reiko anymore,&quot; she says instead.

&quot;Mars Reiko always seemed more fun.&quot;

Rei frowns at her. &quot;Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that.&quot;

&quot;What have you told me?&quot;

&quot;Look, I was concerned for you before. I wanted you to be better. We may 
have had our differences, but I believed we were friends.&quot;

&quot;And now? Do things change because I&#39;m no longer sick?&quot;

&quot;Well, of course things are different now. We no longer have to guard 
the princess,&quot; a shake of her head and she corrects herself, &quot;Usagi. And 
it doesn&#39;t weigh on my mind that you&#39;re no longer ill. It&#39;s wonderful. 
More than anything, before I wanted you to be well. I wanted to believe 
that you would be, no matter what.&quot;

Minako stares at her, a serious expression on her face. &quot;And when I 
wasn&#39;t?&quot;

Rei smiles watery at her before she bows her head. Minako can tell a 
frown has permeated her expression. &quot;I really thought things were going 
to work out. I didn&#39;t want to trust your pessimism,&quot; her voice quivers 
momentarily. She takes a deep breath. &quot;But when they weren&#39;t- and you 
died...&quot; There&#39;s a long pause.

Minako&#39;s hand settles atop of Rei&#39;s. The two of them look at their hands 
and Rei lifts her head to face Mina. The hand that had formerly rested 
along the back of the couch now touches her face lightly. Rei wonders if 
she&#39;s absorbing the warmth from Mina&#39;s fingertips. She ponders if 
before, Mina&#39;s hands had been cold. She hadn&#39;t touched her then so she 
doesn&#39;t have anything to compare it to.

&quot;I&#39;m here now.&quot; Minako says. &quot;The two of us are, in the present. You 
were always bothersome because you made me consider other options and 
think of things I would have preferred not to think about. Maybe I 
shouldn&#39;t have waited so long last time to have the operation but I 
don&#39;t regret it. In the end I chose to have it and it was my decision. 
Still, that&#39;s the past. Maybe I&#39;ve just taken up your position. We 
should hold on to the present and not lose opportunities because of 
fears or other things. But the past should never be forgotten either. If 
you&#39;re still wondering why I kissed you at the temple, that&#39;s my 
answer.&quot;

When Rei lifts her hand to Minako&#39;s which still lingers on her face she 
doesn&#39;t budge though her heart beats irregularly. She wonders if Rei 
will pull the hand away from her face but no, her fingers circle lightly 
around Minako&#39;s hand.

&quot;The past is important,&quot; Rei admits as if in thought. &quot;When you first 
regained your memories, what did you think of me?&quot;

&quot;Oh, that?&quot; Minako smiles. &quot;I remembered you being stubborn and not as 
good a singer as me.&quot;

Rei looks cross. &quot;If you hadn&#39;t been sick I wouldn&#39;t have worried as 
much about you.&quot;

&quot;Well, that&#39;s natural isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Still,&quot; she ignores her remark, &quot;when everything came back I was happy 
that you had returned.&quot;

&quot;You barely glanced at me at first.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want you to get the wrong idea.&quot;

&quot;Which would be?&quot;

There&#39;s a long silence that neither is particularly bothered with. Rei 
has nearly forgotten that Minako&#39;s been touching her face and that Rei 
herself has clasped the idol&#39;s hand. She ponders if the forgetting only 
came about because it feels natural or if it is some other reason. 
Either way, she doesn&#39;t mind it enough to pull away. With a form of 
latent dreading moving through her, she admonishes herself for not 
pointing out that Minako has been moving closer to her. It takes her a 
few moments to collect herself and her thoughts. She knows that this is 
the closest she&#39;s been to anyone and not only in a physical and intimate 
way. As much as Rei would like to deny it, she has to face that she and 
Minako have a bond that she has never been able to find with any other 
person. Her eyes meet Minako&#39;s and she looks grim when she speaks. &quot;I&#39;m 
sure I won&#39;t like it, but can we try it again just to make sure?&quot;

Minako&#39;s lips become an &#39;o&#39; for a second but soon she&#39;s back to business 
as usual and has that haughty teasing smile on her face that Rei is well 
accustomed to. &quot;Is this your way of telling me you want me to kiss you 
again?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re always so arrogant. I just want to be absolutely certain and not 
think of it again.&quot;

&quot;I think you want something to brag about.&quot; Minako scoots closer again. 
&quot;Not everyone gets to kiss Aino Minako.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve forgotten that you kissed me.&quot;

Minako frowns and mentally gives a point to Rei. &quot;Just because I knew 
you&#39;d be too scared to do it yourself.&quot;

&quot;Forget it, I&#39;ve changed my mind.&quot;

When Minako kisses her, Rei wonders why everyone makes a big deal about 
this sort of thing. It&#39;s only moments later when she feels a warm 
feeling spreading through her that she can begin to understand. There&#39;s 
something nice about this that if asked, she wouldn&#39;t be able to 
explain. She feels Minako&#39;s fingers threading through her hair 
delicately and her own lips parting and responding to her. Minako, she 
knows, will never let her live this down and she can&#39;t help but be 
annoyed at this while at the same time not particularly caring. 
Everything about Minako right now is so warm and alive, reassuring. She 
had never intended for this to happen and when they part to breathe Rei 
searches for anything to say. &quot;Where&#39;s Artemis?&quot;

She maintains her composure though she is lightheaded and out of breath. 
&quot;He isn&#39;t here.&quot; Minako isn&#39;t exactly sure where he is, but she assumes 
it&#39;s with Luna and some of the other senshi. Either way, she&#39;s happy 
that it&#39;s worked out this way. Even more so when it&#39;s Rei who leans 
forward and catches her lips.
