<h1>Oira Imei Satsu Made Shikyo (We Shall Stay Together Until Death) (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/oira-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>     Seiya sweatdroped as she walked down the street that night. A 
certain odango haired girl was hitching a piggyback ride. &not;.&not; 
&quot;Odango..? How many ice-creams DID you eat...&quot; Seiya winced and 
adjusted her position so it wouldn&#39;t hurt with Usagi on her back so 
much.

     No answer.

     &quot;Odango?&quot; Seiya looked over her shoulder and smiled softly. Usagi 
was sleeping soundly, her head resting on Seiya&#39;s shoulder. Seiya 
walked the rest of the way to Usagi&#39;s house. She tucked the blond into 
bed and kissed her on the forehead. &quot;Goodnight Odango...Aishiteru...&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      It was very late by the time Seiya reached a bench to sit down 
on on her way home. The Lights&#39; apartment was a good distance away 
from Usagi&#39;s house, but it wasn&#39;t a problem for a senshi. ^-~ The park 
was about half way home so she took a little rest. She looked at her 
watch, it was now 1:36am. ^-^;;;;;;

      Stretching out on the bench she yawned. &quot;Its so good to be back 
on earth.....Odango and Hamburgers...no better combination..&quot;

      &quot;You are out late, all alone, vulnerable. Eh? Little Starlight?&quot;

      Seiya turned sharply and a bright light burst forth, rocketing 
towards her.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Usagi was awakened by a peircing scream and an explosion that 
lit up the night. She gasped, she knew that voice. &quot;Seiya!!!!!&quot; she 
realised she was still in her clothes and ran down the street. MOON 
ETERNAL MAKE UP!!!!!!!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Sailor Moon continued to run but she ran into someone. 
&quot;Yaten-kun! Taiki-san!&quot;

      &quot;Tsukino-san! Wheres Seiya?! We felt she was in danger!&quot;

      &quot;You mean shes fighting alone?!!!&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      Seiya raised her head and backflipped away from another attack. 
&quot;Who are you?!!&quot; she demanded harshly.

      The woman wore a long black dress with a black cape attached. 
She had long black hair, her eyes were bright red, and her skin was a 
ghastly shade of white. &quot;My name is Cordella, and you, are of great 
interest to us. SAILOR STAR FIGHTER!!!!!!!&quot;

      Seiya&#39;s eyes widened and she steped back as Cordella&#39;s eye 
widened and she opened her mouth, hissing, pointed fangs showing.

      &quot;Y-you!&quot; Seiya exclaimed.Then Cordella flew at the ravenhaired 
girl, fangs ready to bite.

      Seiya jumped back with a startled yelp. When she righted 
herself, Cordella was no where to be found. But Seiya was sure she 
wasn&#39;t gone. &quot;FIGHTER STAR POWER!!!! MAKE---&quot; the air caught in her 
lungs as she was grabbed from behind, Cordella&#39;s hand wrapped around 
her throat. Seiya tried to cry out but she couldn&#39;t. She couldn&#39;t 
breathe, no matter how hard she tried, she couldn&#39;t.

      Cordella&#39;s grip grew tighter. &quot;Pathetic. We were under the 
impression that you Starlights were stronger than all the earth senshi 
combined, I&#39;d hate to see an individual earth senshi&#39;s power if your&#39;s 
is so weak.&quot; with every word she tightened her grip.

      Seiya&#39;s eyes were wide with pain. Weakly she raised her hands up 
to try and dislodge Cordella&#39;s but she couldn&#39;t. Her body was shutting 
down due to lack of oxygen, her eyes were starting to close, and she 
couldn&#39;t stop them. 

      It.....can&#39;t.......end..like....this... 

      A tear trailed down Seiya&#39;s cheek.

      Odango.....

      &quot;STAR SENSITIVE INFERNO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;STAR GENTLE UTERUS!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;SILVER MOON CRYSTAL POWER KISS!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      Cordella suddenly dropped Seiya who hit the ground hard. 
Cursing, the vampire swirled her cape and vanished.
     
       Seiya lay there, gasping for air, her throat black and blue and 
very sore. She closed her eyes as her breathing slowed back to normal 
and her body relaxed.

      Sailor Moon ran over to her and held her up. &quot;Seiya! Wake up! 
Seiya!!&quot; the ravenhaired girl&#39;s eyes fluttered. &quot;O..odango....&quot; she 
croaked, running a hand over her neck, wincing.

      &quot;Oh...your poor throat.....being squeesed like that.....Who was 
that woman?!&quot;

      &quot;Her name is Cordella....she...odango....shes a vampire.....&quot;

      &quot;NANI?!?!!&quot;

      Seiya stood up with SM&#39;s help, an arm around her shoulder. 
Healer and Maker came too. &quot;Daijoubu Seiya?&quot; Healer asked.

      &quot;Can you walk?&quot; Maker questioned.

      &quot;Hai...&quot;

      &quot;NOT FOR LONG!!!!!!!!&quot; Cordella appeared behind them and with 
one swipe of her hand, sent Seiya and SM flying. She swung her other 
arm in an identical arc and Healer and Maker were thrown into the 
bushes.

      Seiya looked up from the ground, wincing. 
&quot;That...witch.....ugh...&quot; she grunted as she stood up and got her 
broach out. &quot;FIGHTER STAR POWER!!!!!! MAKE UP!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;Seiya no! You&#39;re not strong enough!&quot; SM cried, rushing to 
Fighter.

      &quot;Odango. Listen. I want you to keep out of danger alright?&quot;

      &quot;Demo...&quot;

      &quot;Stay away from this battle. She&#39;s after me for some reason. And 
I&#39;m gonna find out why.&quot;

      &quot;BAT WING!!!!!!!&quot;

      Fighter grabbed SM and sheilded her from the attack. She tried 
not to scream but she let out a pain-filled shriek.

      &quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;JUPITER OAK EVOLUTION!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;SPACE SWORD BLASTER!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;SUBMARINE REFLECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;CHRONOS TYPHOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;DEATH REBORN REVOLUTION!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      The attacks blasted Cordella&#39;s and her attack stoped, leaving 
Fighter gasping for breath and SM being worried.

      The inner and outer senshi appeared. Mercury had run over to 
Maker and Venus to Healer.

      Cordella raised her hands in the air and she started to glow. &quot;I 
call upon the powers of all darkness....help me achieve the goal of my 
master, Lord Morphium!!!&quot; A wave of dark energy burst forth, 
scattering the senshi in all directions, causing them to all 
dehenshin.

      &quot;O-odango! Daijoubu?!&quot; Seiya shook Usagi. &quot;Odango! Wake up!&quot;

      Usagi&#39;s eyes fluttered open. &quot;Seiya?&quot;

      &quot;Thank Kami you&#39;re awake....&quot;

      &quot;I was worried about you...&quot;

      &quot;Same here Odango....don&#39;t ever scare me like that again....&quot;

      &quot;Alright.....you either.&quot;

      &quot;I won&#39;t....&quot;

      &quot;Don&#39;t make promises you can&#39;t keep you silly baka...&quot; Usagi 
laughed lightly.

      Seiya smiled down at her softly. &quot;I--AHHHH!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      Usagi gasped in horror. Cordella had snuck up behind them and 
sunk her fangs into Seiya&#39;s neck. The girl cried out, her blue eyes 
wide and her mouth agape, gasping in the extreme pain.

      Seiya&#39;s skin became deathly white and her eyes rolled into the 
back of her head as she collapsed.

      Cordella floated up into the air with Seiya slumped over her 
shoulder, limp and lifeless. Usagi screamed. &quot;SEIYA!!!!!&quot; she started 
to run after her but Haruka grabbed her back.

      &quot;No! Koneko its too dangerous!!!!!&quot;

      &quot;LET ME GO!!!!!!!! SEIYA!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      It took Makoto, Haruka, Rei, and Hotaru to keep her still.

      &quot;SEIYA!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

      Cordella smirked. &quot;Do not worry foolish senshi. I am not so 
cruel as to part a girl from her lover forever. I will bring her back 
in one year&#39;s time. That is a promise.&quot; and she vanished, with Seiya, 
who was as limp and lifeless as paper, her eyes closed, her mouth 
hanging open, blood trailing from it.

      Usagi let out anguished scream after anguished scream when the 
two dissapeared. &quot;SEIYA!!!!!!!!!! SEIYA!!!!!!!!!! 
SSSSSSSEEEEEEIIIIIIIIIYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!&quot;
