<h1>Goddess of Light</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mtreiber.html">Michael Treiber</a><br> </h2>
<pre>-A note on timelines- In the first part of this story 
(chronologically...second in order of when they were written) Ami and 
Makoto discover romantic feelings for each other. They decided that 
for the time being, however, that they will keep the relationship a 
secret. Next follow the events chronicled in &quot;A wedding story: My 
Haruka and Michiru fanfic&quot; ...but nothing really happens there. Then 
we move on to the third portion of the story. Ami and Makoto have been 
having a happy little secret affair, but things keep interrupting 
them. So, in order to keep the intimate part of their relationship in 
good working order (read between the lines people...the naughty part) 
they make a ...special tape. Things are working out well, but then 
through a series of amazing coincidences (he he...I love being the 
author) everyone manages to see the tape, and the secret is out. 
Everyone that is...except Minako and Rei, who decide to &quot;borrow&quot; the 
tape and see what all the fuss is about. That was exactly before this 
fic. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako yawned hugely and turned to the raven-haired girl sitting on 
the couch next to her.

&quot;Well...&quot; the bubbly blonde said in her ever so cheerful voice, &quot;That 
was interesting.&quot;

Rei had to think for a moment before answering.

&quot;Um...yeah...&quot; Gesturing to the now blank TV screen, she asked Minako, 
&quot;How DID I let you talk me into watching that? I cant believe we just 
watched Ami and Makoto...&quot; Blushing deeply, she was unable to 
continue.

Wiggling a playful finger at her crimson faced friend, Minako grinned 
and said, 

&quot;As I recall, I didn&#146;t have to do much talking...&quot; 

Subject change time. True...she had been a little curious, but 
still....

&quot;Damn it! How are we supposed to get rid of that tape?&quot;

Minako&#39;s face scrunched up in though for a moment before another one 
of her sunny grins split wide open.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry! Ill think of something!&quot;

&#39;I don&#146;t like the sound of that...&#39; Rei though. But she certainly 
didn&#146;t want to take the tape home...

&quot;Fine, think of something. I have to go.&quot;

After Rei left, Minako chewed her lip thoughtfully. How WAS she 
supposed to get rid of the tape? She couldn&#146;t just give it 
back...could she?

&#39;Don&#146;t be a bubble head&#39; Minako thought. &#39;If you got caught...&#39;

Her internal monologue was cut off by the ringing of the phone. 

&quot;Hello?&quot; She asked into the receiver &lt;Yes...I know...Moshi Moshi would 
have been more appropriate, but this fic is...um...subtitled! Yeah, 
that&#146;s the ticket!&gt;. Her mother&#146;s cheerful voice answered.

&quot;Hi honey! I was just calling to tell you that I just got to the 
airport-and I brought a surprise!&quot;

Minako&#39;s mother had been out of town for the weekend-which was the 
only reason she and Rei had dared to watch &#39;the tape&#39; here. But what 
had her mother been saying about a surprise?

&quot;Is it...a good surprise?&quot;

Though she couldn&#146;t see her mothers grin, she could her it in the 
older woman&#39;s voice.

&quot;You&#146;ll see...&quot;

Minutes after she had hung up and was carefully hiding the tape in her 
room, Minako still felt threads of misgiving twining through her 
heart.

Rei grumbled the whole way home. WHY had Minako wanted to watch that 
tape so badly? Maybe it was just simple curiosity.... or maybe...

&#39;No...&#39; Rei though. &#39;Minako&#39;s not...Is she?&#39;

But no matter how hard she tried to shake it, the idea stuck in Rei&#39;s 
head for the rest of the night.

&quot;You want me to do what!?&quot; Minako&#39;s outraged and -truth be told- 
somewhat confused voice rang through the kitchen.

&quot;Its really quite simple dear...Ill read the note again.&quot;

&quot;Struggling not to grit her teeth in frustration, Minako watched her 
mother pick up the hateful piece of paper again...her &#39;surprise&#39; from 
England. 

&quot;Dear Minako...&quot; her mother began &quot;I&#146;m so very sorry that school kept 
you from coming back for a visit, but Katori tells me what a fine 
young woman you&#146;re turning out to be. She also tells me that you have 
a group of attractive, well-mannered friends. Please feel free to 
introduce my son&#39;s around when they come to visit. Love...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

Katori blinked, somewhat shocked by her daughters dead set refusal. 

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;no&#39;?&quot;

Minako firmly shook her head.

&quot;There is no way I&#146;m setting you friends son&#39;s up with any of my 
friends. Firstly, they&#39;d never forgive me...&quot;

&quot;And secondly?&quot;

&quot;And secondly...&quot; Minako concluded, &quot;With the exception of Rei, 
they&#146;re all involved with someone.&quot;

Frowning for a moment, Katori asked

&quot;I know about Usagi and that delicious, corn-fed stallion Mamoru...&quot; 
The older woman was shocked out of her fantasy of Mamoru in a Speedo 
when she realized that her daughter was looking at her with complete 
horror etched across her face.

Shacking her head, she continued.

&quot;But what about the other girls? Um...Haruka and Michiru for example. 
I&#39;ve never heard either of them mentioned in the same breath as a 
boyfriend...actually, if they&#146;re not careful, rumors are going to 
start about those two...&quot;

Minako barely surpressed a groan. 

&quot;Uh...mom? Haruka and Michiru are...a pair.&quot;

Katori&#39;s face displayed a profound lack of comprehension.

&quot;What do you mean they...oh.&quot; Sudden understanding bloomed across her 
face. &quot;They&#39;re...&quot;

&quot;Lesbians.&quot; Minako helpfully supplied.

&quot;That&#146;s...they&#146;re...well, good for them...I suppose...&quot; Her mother 
seemed shocked that two of Minako&#146;s closest friends were gay. &quot;Well, 
what about Ami? Or Makoto?&quot;

Minako&#39;s face reddened for a moment before Katori cut her off.

&quot;Them too!?&quot; An anxious though flicked between her temples.

Nodding, Minako told her mother,

&quot;Yeah...we were all really surprised, but they make a good couple.&quot;

&quot;What does Ami&#39;s mother think about...all of this?&quot;

Minako shrugged and said,

&quot;She&#39;s really supportive. As far as she&#39;s concerned, if Ami&#39;s happy, 
she is too.&quot;

Katori remained silent for a moment.

&quot;Minako...&quot; she finally said &quot;I know that you don&#146;t have a boyfriend 
right now...is there anything you...want to talk about?&quot;

&quot;Like what&quot; Minako asked, a bit confused.

&quot;Like maybe if you...had a ...&#39;special friend&#39;? A special female 
friend?&quot;

Still confused, Minako responded,

&quot;Well...I suppose Rei and I are special friends...but...I don&#146;t 
know...sometimes we argue, and...&quot;

Katori groaned inwardly. So this was how it was going to be, eh?

&quot;Minako...let&#146;s go sit in the living room...I think we need to have a 
long talk.&quot;

When Rei awoke the next morning, her grandfather was awaiting her in 
the shrine.

&quot;Rei...&quot; he said with a grin, &quot;I have good news. Do you remember your 
cousin Fuma?&quot;

Shaking her head, Rei told him that she didn&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;That&#146;s odd...&quot; he said &quot;because you&#146;re parents were trying to arrange 
a marriage between the two of you when you were younger. Well...now 
for the good news. I&#39;ve contacted his parents, and they&#146;re still 
interested!&quot;

&quot;Absolutely not!&quot; Rei nearly shouted at her grandfather. &quot;There is no 
way that I am letting you arrange a marriage for me!&quot;

Bowing his head for a moment, grandpa Hino said in a soft voice, 

&quot;Rei...I&#146;m not getting any younger. Eventually, you&#146;re going to have 
to take over this temple completely, and then you&#146;re not going to have 
time to look for romance. You don&#146;t have a boyfriend...and I don&#146;t 
want to see you grow as old and lonely as I have.&quot;

Softening her tone, Rei placed her hand on grandpa&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Don&#146;t worry...It&#146;ll all work out. I&#146;m just...not interested, not in 
Fuma anyway.&quot; there was no way that she could tell him the 
truth...about her duties as a senshi, and her knowledge of what was 
going to happen to Tokyo interfering with most hopes for romance. 

The old priest knew that she was hiding something.

&quot;Why not?&quot; he asked. &quot;Fuma is a handsome young man...his parents are 
well off...It would be an idea match...good for the shrine, good for 
you.&quot;

&quot;Grandpa...I cant explain...but...I have to go. Minako&#39;s expecting me 
to meet her at Crown.&quot;

&#39;Cant explain, huh Rei?&#39; the old man thought to himself as his 
granddaughter walked away. &#39;Don&#146;t worry...I always get my way. 
Somehow....Ill find out what you&#146;re hiding.&#39;

&quot;Hello Usagi...please, come in.&quot; Katori invited Minako&#39;s blonde friend 
into the house.

&quot;Thank you Miss Aino...but...I thought that Minako was spending the 
day with Rei...&quot;

Minako&#39;s mother tried not to grit her teeth at the thought.

&quot;...so why&#39;d I get invited over for tea today?&quot;

&quot;I wanted to talk to you...&quot; she replied, &quot; About Minako...and Rei.&quot;

After a couple of hours with Usagi, Katori was no better off. 
Apparently, the girl didn&#146;t know anything about a possible 
...relationship...between Minako and Rei...but they HAD been spending 
a lot of time together...

There was only one choice. She had to go speak to Rei&#39;s grandfather.

&quot;Hello Mr. Hino...I&#146;m glad you could see me on such short notice.&quot;

The priest just smiled. 

&quot;Oh...it&#146;s no problem. But...on the phone, you said you had something 
urgent to speak to me about...is something the matter with Minako? 
Or...is this about Rei?&quot;

Taking a deep breath, Mrs. Aino said,

&quot;Actually...it&#146;s about both of them. You see, over the past month or 
so, I&#39;ve noticed Minako acting a bit...weird.&quot;

Rei&#39;s grandfather nodded,

&quot;Weird? How?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot; Minako&#146;s mother said, &quot;She absolutely refused to see a 
friends son&#39;s...all very nice young men. Actually...&quot;

Hino gasped.

&quot;Rei did the same thing! Refused to see a young man I had set her up 
with!&quot;

Katori nodded, a bit shyly.

&quot;Actually...Rei and Minako...&quot;

&quot;Have been spending all their time with each other recently.&quot; the 
priest finished for her. &quot;Do you think...?&quot;

Sighing, Katori nodded again.

&quot;I think that maybe...we should all have a talk...&quot;

Across town, at the crown game center, Minako and Rei were currently 
enjoying ice cream cones in the snake bar.

&#39;Damn it...&#39; Rei thought, &#39;with all of our friends pairing up...Minako 
and I are the only ones still alone...&#39;

&#39;This is great!&#39; Minako thought at the same time. &#39;With everyone else 
to busy with each other, Rei and I get to hang out all the time!&#39;

They of course had no idea what was going on in their guardian&#146;s heads 
right then.

------------------------------------------------------------

Ok...I know that that ending was weak... but don&#146;t worry...its just 
leading into the next piece!

As always...read and respond.
