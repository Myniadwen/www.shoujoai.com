<h1>Dark Skies, Bright Heavens (part 3 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immora.html">Immora</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkbrite-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Haruka yawned as she sat down at the piano bench. She stretched her 
fingers, carefully rested them on the keys, and started playing a 
complex melody most would never attempt at her age. Kotori and Sunao 
listened with looks of approval clear on their faces. When Haruka 
finished, she simply stood up, at took a seat in an easy chair. Kotori 
and Sunao applauded and grinned at her. &quot;Very good!&quot; Sunao complimented 
her daughter. &quot;I&#39;m quite surprised! It didn&#39;t take long at all for you 
to excel at this!&quot;

Haruka just shrugged and looked up at the ceiling. She was about ten 
years old now, coming near the end of elementary school. She was still 
quite tall and thin, with her hair still worn short. She still hated 
school, the same old waste of time it always was. And just like when she 
was younger, she didn&#39;t have much to speak of in the way of friends. The 
girls avoided her because she was so much taller and tougher than they 
were. The boys sometimes let her play with them, but often wouldn&#39;t 
since she was a girl. Haruka didn&#39;t care at all whether they accepted 
her or not. When everyone else played and didn&#39;t let her in, she&#39;d go 
off on her own, running, exploring, swinging, nothing that you really 
needed someone else there to do. The piano lessons her grandmother gave 
her had finally wound down to a close, and Kotori had no more to teach 
her. Haruka still promised to practice though, so she wouldn&#39;t lose the 
skills she&#39;d acquired.

Haruka fingered the cross around her neck lightly and sighed. Her family 
made sure they attended church regularly, and she was strong in her 
faith, but she thought church itself was boring and pointless. She 
entertained herself by watching a cute girl whose family sat a few rows 
in front of them, ignoring most of the priest&#39;s talk.

Katai was making it a point to come home early tonight. Any other day, 
however, he didn&#39;t seem to care if he came home at 8 PM or 2 AM. Haruka 
didn&#39;t see her father much. A few months ago, when it wasn&#39;t too late at 
night, she&#39;d have long talks with him, and it always made her feel 
better. Sunao wouldn&#39;t usually join in; she went to bed early, exhausted 
from housework. Lately though, he&#39;d been getting more and more wrapped 
up in his work, and he never talked to her except to criticize her. 
Haruka hated it. He was supposed to encourage her, not _discourage_ her. 
&quot;Why can&#39;t you be more ladylike?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re going to be a failure if you 
keep acting like _that_.&quot; &quot;Stop complaining, Haruka-chan, and just do 
it. We should have just gotten a dog, at least they listen when you tell 
them what to do.&quot;

It hurt to hear those things from the father she&#39;d once loved and 
trusted. She wasn&#39;t sure now if she hated him or not, but she sure 
wouldn&#39;t have a heart-to-heart with him anytime soon. Her mother wasn&#39;t 
exactly close to her or distanced from her. Sunao had just recently 
gotten a job and worked while Haruka was at school. On rare occasions, 
she would pull a late shift, but that was only every few weeks. Haruka 
spent a lot time with her, talking with her or helping her around the 
house, but part of her was a bit ruffled by the &quot;weakness&quot; her mother 
showed. Sunao wasn&#39;t exactly a joyful person. While she would smile and 
laugh, her life wasn&#39;t nearly as full as it could have been. She and 
Katai had drifted from each other, and even though they were still 
married in legal terms, they didn&#39;t get along well anymore, not that 
Katai was home enough for it to matter. She tried hard to raise Haruka, 
but to Haruka, it was obvious that her mother wasn&#39;t making the usual 
attempts a mother would make; the death of her newly born son had 
shattered the outlook she had on the whole child-rearing process. Most 
mothers would try to mold their children into the ideal, perfect kids, 
to teach them as many values as they could and to prepare them for the 
real world, even if it meant being harsh on them. Sunao let Haruka do as 
she pleased, didn&#39;t punish her for anything, and let her form her own 
opinions on issues rather than try to teach her how to see things like 
life, religion, and responsibility. Haruka was given a great deal of 
freedom by her mother, and Sunao&#39;s spoilings--a fairly large allowance, 
letting her have her way, taking her wherever she wanted to go--were far 
preferable to the strict attitude her father showed. Sunao was very 
reserved, rarely leaving the house one she was home from work, and 
didn&#39;t speak to many people outside of the family unless necessary.

Haruka shook her head, clearing her thoughts as she stood up and walked 
away from the piano bench. Sunao and Kotori were talking with each other 
now, and Haruka was tired, so she headed upstairs for her room. She sat 
down on the bed and started flipping through some manga with a bored 
look on her face. She heard her mother call up to her a little while 
later, &quot;Haruka-chan, I&#39;m staying with my parents tonight, be back 
tomorrow! Tell your father where we went when he gets home, okay? Oh, 
there&#39;s a tiny bit of food left, so throw together something for dinner 
and I&#39;ll go to the store tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Yes, okaa-san! Oh, may I go down to the park later?&quot;

&quot;Sure! Be good, okay, and don&#39;t get into trouble!&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t! Bye!&quot;

Haruka heard the door shut and the car pull away shortly after that. 
Running down the stairs, she grabbed a key for the front door to lock it 
behind her as she left for the park, then took off running. She loved to 
run, to feel the wind against her face as she tried to outrace it. It 
didn&#39;t take long to get to the park since it was right across the 
street. She slowed down a bit, heading over to the playground. She went 
to the back section where the monkey bars were, on top of a tall hill 
that overlooked a lake. She looked around to make sure no one else was 
there, then climbing up on top of them. She crawled across to the 
middle, then carefully stood, balancing on the rungs. At first, her 
heart pounded quickly, her arms held out at her sides to keep from 
losing her footing. Then she relaxed, closed her eyes, and stood 
listening to all the sounds around her, enjoying the breeze blowing by.

She didn&#39;t know how long she stood there. Eventually, she got tired of 
keeping balance, took a deep breath, and leapt off the monkey bars. For 
a few fractions of a second, she was in flight, soaring with the wind. 
Then of course, gravity had to spoil everything, and she landed 
perfectly on her feet. She cast a quick glance down the hill at the 
lake, then turned to walk back home and go up to her room again.

She went back to reading the manga until her stomach growled with hunger 
about four hours later. She trudged down the stairs to the refrigerator, 
barely noticing what she pulled out and stuck in the microwave. She took 
it out, sat down, and ate in a hurry, then placed her dishes in the sink 
and went back upstairs to read some more. After awhile, she got too 
sleepy to stay awake. It was getting late, and she had school the next 
day. Haruka went downstairs and wrote a note to Katai, then went back 
upstairs, slipped into her pajamas, and climbed into her bed, falling 
asleep quickly.



Katai did _not_ have a good day at work that day. He&#39;d been in meetings 
for a long amount of time, arguing back and forth with all the other 
employees as he tried to make his view known, but everyone seemed to be 
against him. He missed lunch break while he was busy typing a report, 
but the report ended up being lost when the power somehow went out and 
he hadn&#39;t saved it yet. He started over, but missed the deadline. Then 
he had to go to another meeting, and give a presentation which didn&#39;t go 
over well. He left work early as planned, but got caught in a horrible 
traffic jam, running out of gas while stuck in it and also getting a 
flat tire driving over a nail, and had to be towed and sit for over an 
hour waiting to get his car back. He got home later than he would have 
if he&#39;d left at the normal time. Since he&#39;d also missed dinner because 
of the traffic jam, he was ravenous by the time he got home. When he got 
home, he went immediately to the refrigerator, wondering to himself, 
&quot;Where is Sunao?&quot; Right now, he&#39;d feel a lot better with her here, even 
if they weren&#39;t very close anymore. He noticed a note on the fridge 
reading &quot;Need to go to grocery store ASAP.&quot; Next to that was a letter 
written almost entirely in kana, indicating it written by Haruka. 
&quot;Okaa-san went to her mother&#39;s house. Will be back tomorrow.&quot;

Katai rested his head against the door and grimaced. &quot;Can&#39;t anything go 
right today?&quot;

He looked over at the sink and saw a number of dirty dished in it. From 
that, he guessed that whatever food they had before was already eaten, 
leaving him with very little. He opened the refrigerator again and 
looked for something, _anything_ to eat. There was a bit of turkey, some 
old grapes, and several bottles of beer. Grumbling, Katai took out the 
turkey and beer, throwing out the grapes. He chewed on the turkey for a 
bit, guzzling a beer quickly; he was in a very foul mood, maybe it would 
calm him, it usually mellowed him somewhat. He turned on the t.v. and 
flipped the channel to a random show. Finishing the turkey, he grabbed 
another beer, then another, losing track of how many he&#39;d had.



Haruka stirred and awoke to see it was still dark outside, probably 
around midnight. She wondered why she had woken up, and then noticed the 
sounds of the television and loud laughter. What the... Oh, her father. 
He was being a lot louder than he should be this late at night. Haruka 
wearily rubbed her eyes and started down the stairs, wondering why her 
father was being so rude.

She was quite surprised when she entered the living room and saw him 
sitting there with several empty beer bottles around him, another one 
less than half full in his hand. His eyes were bloodshot and he was 
clearly drunk, barely awake. Haruka walked in cautiously, and moved to 
turn the volume down on the t.v. without disturbing his near-slumber.

&quot;Whaddaya think you&#39;re doing?!&quot; Katai slurred, swaying to his feet. &quot;Get 
back upstairs, now!&quot;

&quot;Otou-san, I couldn&#39;t get to sleep, I just--&quot;

&quot;You also have to presume, don&#39;cha? I&#39;m getting real sick o&#39; this, kid, 
y&#39;know that?&quot; He stumbled towards her with a very angry look on his 
face. &quot;Your mama is too easy on you. Y&#39;never get in trouble with her, 
you get to do whatcha want, and I&#39;m tired of sitting here while you live 
the easy life! I gotta work to earn this family good stuff, and you just 
get spoiled wit&#39; it.&quot;

Haruka was very concerned by now, and she started backing towards the 
stairs frightfully. Why did her father have to drink so much? He&#39;d never 
done this before when he&#39;d been drinking, at least that she knew of. 
&quot;I&#39;m going back to bed, otou-san,&quot; she mumbled, dashing for the stairs.

She let out a shriek when she didn&#39;t even make it to the first step. 
Katai had grabbed onto her arm tightly, and he swung her around, 
throwing her to the ground. &quot;Otou-san, what&#39;s wrong?!&quot; she cried at him. 
She knew he was drunk, but this...

She let out a loud, pain-filled scream as his foot connected with her 
ribs. Terrified, she scrambled away, half-crawling across the floor. He 
pursued her, driving her into a corner. Haruka huddled, her arms thrown 
over her head, shaking hard with tears pouring down her face. &quot;Otou-san, 
please! Don&#39;t hurt me!&quot;

&quot;Shut-up, bitch! You&#39;re a pathetic excuse for a daughter, and I&#39;m sick 
and tired of putting up with you! You&#39;re gettin&#39; what you deserve!&quot;

He hit her arms hard, making her scream again, and rained blows on them, 
the house echoing with her almost nonstop screaming. He kicked her un- 
protected shins; she&#39;d pulled her knees up against her chin to try to 
keep away from him. She sobbed uncontrollably as her arms and legs 
throbbed with pain as her father continued to relentlessly beat her.

Finally, he backed away, and Haruka rolled onto her side, groaning and 
coughing hard. He kicked her in the back a few times, causing her to fly 
back against the wall from the strength of one of the blows and her head 
to snap back and hit the wall, knocking her unconscious. He stood there 
for a bit, looking down at her crumpled, bloodied form, then stumbled 
away to his room, where he collapsed on the bed and fell asleep.



Haruka regained consciousness early the next morning. One of her eyes 
was gummed shut with blood, and she could barely lift her head enough to 
see the room was faintly lit, the sun just starting to rise. She moaned 
and tried to get up, the pain of trying to move making her stomach 
churn. She trembled and closed her eye tight, her body racked with 
trembles. She started to sit up, but the wave of dizziness that went 
through her kept her from getting far. It hurt to move, her arms and 
legs were badly bruised and bloodied, and her back felt sore as well, 
probably bruised too. She gingerly raised a hand to her face and brushed 
it across the eye she couldn&#39;t open, wincing with pain as she realized 
it wasn&#39;t just blood sealing it shut, but also the fact it was swollen.

She nearly had a heart attack when her father walked in, and despite the 
pain of doing so, she scrambled away again. &quot;Cut that out and get up,&quot; 
he spat. The drunkenness appeared to be gone, but he was still bitter 
and his head throbbed. &quot;Hurry up, willya?!&quot;

Haruka carefully stood, leaning heavily against the wall. Her head spun 
and she fought back tears, avoiding meeting the gaze of the father who 
had betrayed her trust.

&quot;Go take a shower and wash all that blood off. You&#39;re still going to 
school, so get a clean uniform out. I&#39;ll bandage you up before you 
leave. If anyone asks, you got in a fight after school; that&#39;s truth 
enough. If you say one word about this to anyone, and I mean _anyone_, 
I&#39;ll beat you even more, got it?&quot;

Haruka barely managed to nod as she trudged up the stairs, wincing with 
each step. She got out her uniform, took off her pajamas, and stepped 
into the shower, gratefully slipping into the hot water. She flinched at 
the stinging sensation of water meeting the cuts, but tried to ignore 
it. Taking a washcloth, she carefully washed the blood from her limbs, 
face, and back, then she lathered up her hair and washed it as well. She 
could feel liquid spilling down her cheeks; shower water mixed with 
tears. She was careful when she slipped on her clothes, trying to avoid 
brushing against her wounds. When she opened the door, she saw her 
father there. He had a first-aid kit in his hand and was frowning 
darkly. He was something far less than gentle when he wrapped her arms 
and legs tightly where there was evidence of what had happened. He put 
gauze over her black eye, taping it in place with medical tape. He then 
handed her a back brace, and left to let her put it on herself. She 
combed her hair carefully to avoid contact with the bump on her head. 
Staring down at all the bandages made her start to cry harder, and she 
felt the wave of nausea go through her again and she knelt in front of 
the toilet and immediately threw up. She trembled as she wiped her 
mouth, and grabbed a cup to fill with water, desperately trying to get 
the taste out of her mouth. She looked up into the mirror and her 
pitiful reflection. The skin around her eyes was blotchy with red from 
her crying, some blood-vessels broken from her vomiting. She took 
several deep breaths, trying to regain some form of composure, and went 
downstairs where Katai was waiting.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing to eat in the house, so you&#39;re going to school without 
breakfast or lunch. Remember what I told you,&quot; he warned. &quot;You&#39;re 
walking today, so get going before I decide to drive you, and believe 
me, you won&#39;t like it if I take you.&quot;

Haruka grabbed her bookbag left the house in a daze. She barely noticed 
the pavement under her feet as she walked. A large breeze was blowing, 
ruffling her hair and skirt, and she gratefully paused and closed her 
eyes. The wind... it had many forms, she mused to herself, strong or 
gentle, but always powerful no matter what form. It was almost 
comforting in some small way. She was compelled to stay standing in the 
breeze, but she had to get going if she was going to get to school on 
time. She put on an emotionless face to mask her feelings as she walked 
along the sidewalk. She&#39;d been betrayed, beaten, and ignored. She had 
trusted her father, opened up to him, and he still frowned upon her and 
hurt her, physically and emotionally. She had no one to turn to, and 
even if she did... Haruka was too terrified to consider ever letting 
anyone close to her again; what if she got hurt again by someone else?

Haruka entered the school building and took her seat. Only a few other 
kids were there; it was still a bit early. She ignored their shocked 
gazes and whispered comments. She didn&#39;t want to talk to them, never 
had, never would.

A girl with long brown hair and soft green eyes came over to her. Haruka 
couldn&#39;t help but notice how pretty the girl was, and was surprised when 
the girl laid her hand on hers and asked, &quot;Are you okay? You look like 
you&#39;ve been hurt pretty badly. Do you want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;N-no... I&#39;ll be okay.&quot; Haruka pulled her hand away and turned her head 
to look out the window and hide her blush. The girl walked away.

Haruka couldn&#39;t help but reel with shock afterwards. Why had she noticed 
that girl&#39;s looks? She never really paid attention to appearances, well, 
not including that girl at church, but still... her hand felt warm from 
where the girl had laid her hand on hers. Haruka was irritated with 
herself for blushing. She was just some girl that was concerned, that&#39;s 
all! Why should she get so worked up over a girl?!

More students were filing in, and the teacher had come in as well. 
Several kids came over to her and asked how she was, but she didn&#39;t 
respond to their questions. The guys she sometimes played with during 
P.E. teased her a bit and she ignored them. Sure, they were fun to play 
with in basket- ball, but they were otherwise jerks.

When the bell rang, the teacher rather loudly asked (drawing lots of 
attention as well), &quot;Haruka-chan, what happened to you?! Are you all 
right; do you want to see the nurse?!&quot;

Haruka sighed inwardly; she _had_ to answer now, this was the teacher, 
and if she didn&#39;t say anything, the teacher would probably call the 
house, and her mom would be there... Haruka felt chilled. If the teacher 
suspected anything and called, and Katai found out... Haruka mumbled 
quickly, &quot;I got in a fight yesterday.&quot;

&quot;Looks like it was a pretty bad fight! What were you doing fighting with 
someone?&quot;

&quot;It was... a misunderstanding.&quot;

The teacher made a &quot;tsk&quot; sound, and turned to the chalkboard and started 
writing. Haruka hid her face from view and choked back tears again. God, 
why did this have to happen? Her hand fumbled for the cross around her 
neck, silently saying a prayer.

The boy next to her leaned over and whispered, &quot;Hey, who won, you or the 
other person?&quot;

Haruka ignored him.

&quot;Stupid... you probably lost.&quot;

Haruka opened the textbook needed for the assignment the teacher was 
writing on the board. Her arms throbbed slightly whenever she moved 
them, but she fought to ignore the pain and focused on the lesson.

She barely made it through the day. Having gone without two meals and 
with a constant aching sensation coursing through her, the day was sheer 
agony. She was surprised when, while leaving the school grounds, she saw 
Teinei driving in her car. Teinei immediately stopped, pulled over, and 
ran over to Haruka. &quot;Haruka-chan! What happened?&quot;

&quot;I-I got in a fight, oba-san.&quot;

&quot;You want to talk about it?&quot;

&quot;No... I-I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;... Um, hop in; I&#39;ll give you a ride.&quot;

Haruka gratefully climbed into the car, but winced slightly while 
putting the seatbelt on. Her stomach growled loudly and Teinei looked at 
her with a bit of amusement. &quot;Hungry? I&#39;ll take you some place to eat, 
okay? Sunao-chan shouldn&#39;t mind too much.&quot;

&quot;Thanks! I haven&#39;t eaten all day!&quot;

Teinei looked very surprised at first, then she said, &quot;Well, all the 
more reason to take you somewhere, right?&quot;

Teinei started talking more; Haruka barely listened, however. Teinei was 
babbling something about Haruka&#39;s third cousin moving in with her, but 
Haruka didn&#39;t follow it; she&#39;d never met Murasaki. Teinei was talking 
about work and stuff after that, but Haruka didn&#39;t notice. They pulled 
up at a restaurant after several minutes. They ate in relative silence. 
Afterwards, Teinei took Haruka home, then went on to her house.

Haruka was nervous when she went inside. Sunao was home, unloading 
groceries. She looked up at Haruka and smiled, then came over and very 
carefully hugged her. &quot;Hello, Haruka-chan, how was your day?&quot;

&quot;Uh... I don&#39;t know... bad, I guess...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry to hear that. Your father told me you got into a fight at the 
playground yesterday after I left. I thought I told you to stay out of 
trouble, Haruka, why weren&#39;t you more careful?&quot;

Haruka didn&#39;t answer; her mind was whirling too fast. Katai had talked 
with her and _lied_ to her... She wished she could curl up in her 
mother&#39;s arms and cry her eyes out and confess everything, but she was 
so scared of what might happen to her if she told her mother... and what 
if Katai hurt Sunao as well? If Sunao _did_ find out and went to the 
authorities with it, Katai might hurt them both...

&quot;Haruka-chan? Are you all right? Here, let&#39;s get some clean bandages on 
those and see how your eye is doing.&quot;

Haruka followed Sunao into her bathroom, and bit her lip when Sunao 
tenderly unwrapped her arms and legs. Sunao let out a short exclamation 
of surprise. &quot;My goodness! Haruka-chan, I am not letting you out of the 
house except for school for the next few weeks. These look terrible! How 
many people did you fight anyways?&quot; 

&quot;I... don&#39;t remember...&quot;

Sunao carefully wrapped new bandages around her arms, and carefully 
peeled the gauze from her eye, putting a fresh piece on. &quot;Haruka-chan, 
you are lucky that you got out of that fight...&quot; she hugged Haruka 
gently, &quot;From the looks of things, it must have been pretty rough. 
Please, don&#39;t ever do that again. You&#39;re hurt badly, I can tell, and I 
don&#39;t want you to go through this again, okay?&quot;

&quot;... yeah...&quot;

How could she have bought that lie Katai told her?! And how could he 
have done this to her... what if he did it again?...

Haruka shoved aside Sunao and ran to her bedroom. She slammed the door 
shut, locking it and propping a chair against the handle, then made sure 
her windows were shut tight and locked well, then she dove into her 
closet and shut the door as well, shivering all over as she lay there in 
the darkness trying not to cry again.</pre>
