<pre>Chapter One: The Letter

&#39;You sit there nonchalantly, your golden hair to the side, 
reading a book. Have I ever told you how beautiful you look like that? 
I didn&#39;t think so. You slowly look up at me as I write this, and every 
once in a while an odd gleam sparkles in your deep blue eyes. I wonder 
what you&#39;re thinking, my love. I wonder what you would think if I told 
you how much I admire you for your beauty, your courage, and your 
kindness toward I and the others even in the hardest of times. I wonder 
too much. But, if you knew what I was writing, would you laugh? Would 
you just smile that beautiful smile and laugh at how silly this sounds? 

As I look at you, I am sure words cannot express what I feel 
inside, the way my heart flutters nervously as I imagine what it would 
be like to run my hands through your soft blonde hair, or the way I 
feel as you laugh at my serious expression. In the last sentence, I 
only scraped the surface of my emotions, I am sure. 

Sometimes it feels as if  you feel the same way about me. Other 
times it seems as if we are &#39;just friends&#39;. I truly wish you knew how 
much I care for you, Minako. 

From the first time I saw you, I knew I was in love. I just 
didn&#39;t know how to tell you. So here I am, finally admitting my true 
feelings, and praying you feel the same way. Do you remember the time 
that I kissed you, when my body was supposedly taken over by that demon 
from the well? I&#39;m sure you do. Well, truthfully, I was in partial 
control at that time. All that time it was I kissing you, and you 
didn&#39;t know it. I almost wish you had known it. 
Then maybe you and I would have a chance together. I feel something 
powerful is about to happen. Something we cannot control. Death is on 
the horizon, and the Shrine has told me it will split us even further 
apart then we already are. At least, it feels that we have split apart. 
I don&#39;t know anymore. You just don&#39;t seem to know me anymore. Always 
nervous around me, quiet, intent on your studies, even. You&#39;re acting 
completely out of character. Do you feel the evil, too? Or have I been 
too visibly obvious in expressing my feelings for you? I told you I 
wonder too much. For now, I shall try and hide it... Though I&#39;m not 
sure I can for much longer.

Rei Hino looked over her letter. It was truly unlike her. 

&quot;Lovey-dovey piece of shit.&quot; She muttered under her breath, 
letting her large violet eyes wander unknowingly to her best friend, 
Minako Aino. Her heart ached at the mere thought of the golden-haired 
Senshi, who, at the time, was just sitting on a beanbag reading a book 
on dreams and their meanings. Rei smiled at the irony of it all. 
Although all of the Senshi knew their dreams were actually memories of 
the Silver Millennium, Minako still strove to learn more about dreams. 
She wouldn&#39;t tell the other Senshi of them, however. This confused Rei 
greatly, and she found herself wishing she could read Minako&#39;s mind at 
times. 

&quot;Rei? Rei...&quot; The raven-haired girl jumped at the mention of her 
name, and saw Minako looking at her curiously. Damn it all to hell. 
She&#39;d been caught staring!

&quot;Huh? Oh... Oops. Gomen, Mina-hi...-chan. Just zoning off, I 
guess!&quot; she said, allowing a nervous chuckle to escape her lips and 
hoping her blonde friend would buy it. Minako seemed to, and went back 
to reading her book. Rei uttered a sigh of relief, looking over her 
letter nervously.

&quot;Should I give it to her?&quot; She mumbled to herself, brushing back 
a strand of long jet-black hair behind her ear. She had been working on 
this letter for the past hour, and somehow it still didn&#39;t seem right. 
It wasn&#39;t... Fitting enough. Weird how, just a few hours ago she was 
sure that she and Minako were just friends, and now she found herself 
contemplating on whether or not to give her a love note! What a screwed 
up world!

&quot;Rei-Chan, come sit over here. You look tired, and you have been 
writing whatever you&#39;ve been writing for hours!&quot; Minako said, twiddling 
absent-mindedly with the scarlet bow in her hair, and, much to Rei&#39;s 
chagrin, smiling at her like a true friend. 

I was foolish ever to think I loved her, Rei thought, I mean, 
we&#39;re just friends. It&#39;s only a crush! It&#39;ll pass! And with that 
thought, she sat down to rest upon the crimson beanbag  beside her best 
friend. 

&quot;So, what&#39;re you reading?&quot; She asked in a feeble attempt to make 
conversation, although she knew very well what Minako was reading.

&quot;Oh, just some book on dreams and their meaning. I found it at 
the library. It&#39;s really quite fascinating.&quot; Minako stammered 
hurriedly. Rei looked at the cover of the paperback book and read the 
title.

&quot;Dreams: Your Magic Mirror, by Elsie Sechrist. Based On the 
Teachings of Edgar Cayce... Sounds boring, if you ask me! Who&#39;d think 
that Aino Minako, famous blonde, would read a book with such a dull 
title?&quot; Rei asked, laughing. Minako blushed a delicate pink.

&quot;Rei! It really IS interesting! Ami actually showed it to me one 
day, and she said she&#39;s read it fourteen times already! I can see why, 
really. There are a bunch of little things you can miss in here, or 
things you can&#39;t remember unless you write them down.&quot; The 
golden-haired girl said, her mouth turned up into a wry half-smile for 
a split second, but then it disappeared as quickly as it had come.

&quot;Really? And what is it you can&#39;t remember?&quot; The Shinto Priestess 
asked her best friend mockingly. &quot;Being as how you usually have the 
attention span of a fruit fly, I&#39;m not surprised!&quot;

&quot;HEY! Rei, that was just so uncalled for!&quot; The blonde giggled. 
Good, Rei thought, she wasn&#39;t offended.  

&quot;Gomen Nasai, Mina-chan!&quot; She apologized. &quot;But it just seemed 
like the right thing to say!&quot;

&quot;Oh, really? Well, aren&#39;t YOU the nice one today?&quot; Minako asked, 
that wry smile once again appearing upon her delicate face.  

&quot;Okay, so maybe I&#39;m a little cranky today!&quot; Admitted the 
raven-haired girl, &quot;But it&#39;s really not my fault!!!&quot;

&quot;Whose fault is it, then?&quot; Queried Minako.

&quot;None of your beeswax.&quot; Rei said huffily, crossing her arms over 
her chest in indignation.

&quot;Grumpy grumpy!&quot; The blonde said, wagging a finger in front of 
Rei&#39;s face warningly. 

&quot;So what if I am?&quot; 

&quot;So... Something&#39;s OBVIOUSLY bugging you, and I want to know what 
it is!&quot; Minako smiled. Rei suddenly became nervous. She realized how 
close she was to spilling EVERYTHING... The way she felt, the letter... 
It was all too much for her! Then, she had an idea,,,

&quot;Ihaveacrushonsomeone.&quot; Rei admitted. At least it was the truth.

&quot;You WHAT?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Rei faltered, but then realized that, since Minako didn&#39;t 
go to her school, she could make somebody up! &quot;I have a crush on 
someone.&quot;

&quot;OH MY GOD!!! Rei! This is wonderful! Who is he? Anyone I know? 
Anyone the others know? Someone from your school? Someone who stopped 
by at the Temple one day? Wh...&quot; Minako paused, then lowered her voice 
to a hushed whisper &quot;It&#39;s Yuuchiro, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

For a second, Rei felt like she was going to puke. Yuuchiro? Ew! 
Rei couldn&#39;t even begin to imagine where the blonde Senshi had gotten 
that idea! Reluctantly, she played along.

&quot;Yeah.&quot; She said, forcing a smile. 

&quot;I knew it! He&#39;s crazy about you, Rei! Absolutely crazy!&quot; 

&quot;I noticed...&quot; Rei muttered bitterly. 

&quot;You act like it&#39;s a bad thing!&quot; Minako said. &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve never 
had anyone that crazy about me! I&#39;ve always had to go after them!&quot;

Little does she know... Rei thought, lying down upon the cushy 
beanbag.

&quot;Seriously, Rei, you should be proud of the fact that somebody 
loves you enough to chase after you for the past three years!&quot;

&quot;I am, it&#39;s just... I like him and all...&quot; She spat out the 
sentence as if it were poison. &quot;But he&#39;s just so fucking... CLINGY!&quot; 
Rei threw her hands up in the air in exasperation. 

&quot;Shhhh... You&#39;ll wake everyone up...&quot; Minako said, looking at Rei 
quizzically. &quot;So you have a crush on him, but think he&#39;s too clingy?&quot;

&quot;Uhh... That&#39;s right...&quot; Rei said as convincingly as she could 
manage. 

&quot;I see... Well, this is a job for Minako, Senshi of Love!!!&quot; 
Minako said, grinning ear-to-ear, her pearly white teeth glittering in 
the light of the bright room. She jumped up and grabbed Rei&#39;s hand. As 
she registered Minako&#39;s feather-light touch, shivers were sent up Rei&#39;s 
spine at the thought of the blonde&#39;s smooth skin against her own. 
Without even knowing what she was doing, as soon as she was up, the 
raven-haired girl pulled Minako against her, and pressed her lips to 
hers.

The taste of spearmint gum immediately flooded Rei&#39;s senses, and 
Minako, she noted, didn&#39;t seem to want to break away. Their lips 
pressed together even harder, and soon Rei felt Minako give her lips a 
few flicks with her tongue gently. Turning around, Rei immediately 
pushed Minako into a wall, rubbing her lower abdomen against the blonde 
angels&#39; sensually. Minako pushed Rei away right at that exact moment, 
breathing heavily. 

&quot;Rei... I don&#39;t think we should be doing this...&quot; She said, 
trying to calm herself down.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Rei asked, also breathing heavily due to this sudden 
burst of passion.

&quot;Because... Because... I don&#39;t know! You have a crush on 
Yuuchiro, don&#39;t you?

&quot;No.&quot; Rei whispered &quot;I don&#39;t.&quot; And her lips eagerly sought 
Minako&#39;s again, only to be pushed away once more. 

&quot;Rei! Please... Don&#39;t. Don&#39;t do this to me!&quot;

&quot;To you? What am I doing to you? Think about what it&#39;s doing to 
me!&quot;

&quot;It?&quot; Minako queried, her eyes questioningly boring into the 
raven-haired girls&#39;

&quot;This... The kissing and the... This thing I&#39;m feeling...&quot;

&quot;Thing you&#39;re feeling? Confusion?&quot;

&quot;Love.&quot; Rei said simply. Minako&#39;s eyes grew wide with fear as she 
realized that Rei meant what she said, and that she herself felt the 
same way.  

&quot;Rei-chan... I... I&#39;ve gotta go... I have to leave.&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan.&quot; Rei helplessly said her best friend&#39;s name as the 
blonde girl bent down to pick up her book and overnight-pack. &quot;Don&#39;t 
leave. You&#39;re supposed to be staying the weekend here at the Shrine. 
Where are you going to go?&quot;

&quot;Usagi&#39;s. I have to go see Usagi.&quot; Minako said, apparently 
frightened out of her wits. 

&quot;Minako, please don&#39;t leave! It&#39;s two o&#39;clock in the morning! I 
don&#39;t think Ikuko and Kenji would appreciate it very much if you just 
up and waltzed in!&quot; Minako sat back down dejectedly, realized that her 
raven-haired friend was right, and buried her head in her hands.

&quot;Damnit! Damnit all to hell!&quot; She cried. Rei didn&#39;t know what 
else to do, so she sat down upon the bed next to Minako and put an arm 
around her comfortingly.

&quot;Shhh... Mina-chan. It&#39;ll all work itself out.&quot; She said, smiling 
at Minako with her even, white teeth.

&quot;I know! I&#39;m just so... So fucking confused it isn&#39;t even funny!&quot; 
The blonde said, looking at Rei with tears in her clear blue eyes. &quot;I 
just don&#39;t know what I&#39;m feeling right here... Right 
now...for...for...&quot; She was hypnotized within the realms of Rei&#39;s 
sparkling violet eyes, and before she knew what she was doing, she had 
leaned foreward and gently kissed her best friend on her lips.

Rei was surprised at how...intimate Minako was getting. She 
wrapped her arms around Minako protectively as their kiss deepened. She 
felt the blonde&#39;s hands travel up her back, to the tie on her halter 
top, and begin to untie it. Soon it was off of her shoulders, exposing 
her strapless bra. 

Minako&#39;s thoughts all processed with the speed of a 150 mph car. 
A whirlwind of emotion posessed her, and her hands somehow found their 
way upon Rei&#39;s halter top tie, undoing it with ease and desire. Her 
tongue flicked at Rei&#39;s teeth with such force that they opened 
unwillingly, and she gently laid Rei down on the bed, still kissing 
her. She heard her raven-haired friend groan sensually into her mouth, 
and she broke away before realizing that her plaid miniskirt had hiked 
up past her hips.

Rei&#39;s heart was beating about 300 mph, she was sure of it. She 
had never felt such passion, such desire before in her life, much less 
for another woman! As Minako broke the kiss, she moved her perfectly 
manicured hands to the blonde&#39;s hips, and tentatively began to pull 
Minako&#39;s lower abdomen towards hers again, causing a rush of pleasure 
to fill her body. 

&quot;Rei-hime.&quot; Minako moaned, lowering her head and nibbling gently 
at Rei&#39;s neck. The girl responded by puttiing her hands on Minako&#39;s 
bottom and pressing even harder than she had before. It felt so...right 
to her at that moment. She made up her mind that she didn&#39;t care what 
anybody else thought, as long as she could be with Rei forever. 


A/N: hehehe! Somewhat of a cliffie!!!!! Well, not really, but I 
don&#39;t care! It&#39;s just that I&#39;d start freaking out if somebody left a
