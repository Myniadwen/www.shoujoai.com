<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch38.html">Back to Part 38</a><p><u>(Dark Void)</u></p><p><i>In the beginning there was darkness.</i></p><p><i>The sky was 
dark, and empty. It had been that way since the day I had first laid eyes on it. But today, 
for some peculiar reason, there were dark-gray clouds beginning to swirl overhead. Brief 
flashes of light could be seen flickering within the thick cover. I didn’t know how I knew 
it, but a storm was approaching.</i></p><p><i>Today, there would be another fight. There 
were battles every day, but it was so long ago that I can no longer distinguish who the 
enemy was anymore. Who was I fighting? It didn’t matter. I was being attacked so I fought 
back. </i></p><p><i>That was the first time that I met them.</i></p><p><i>A young boy and 
his twin sister... I was injured at the time. I thought they were going to attack me, but to 
my surprise, they didn’t. </i></p><p>“<i>Hey...! Hey! Are you all right?!” 
</i></p><p>“<i>Wait, don’t try to move. You’re hurt.” The woman kneeled down beside me while 
the young man cautiously peered around.</i></p><p>“<i>Crap! They really don’t know when to 
give up!” He turned to look at me and the blood drained from his face. “Oh wow! You’re 
really banged up, aren’t you? It must hurt quite a bit...”</i></p><p>“<i>Who are 
you?”</i></p><p><i>I could see the young woman’s energy beginning to flow around my wound, 
healing it. Why were they helping me?</i></p><p>“<i>OH! Well...I’m Apollo...and this is my 
sister, Artemis! But don’t worry about that right now. We need to get you patched up and get 
going! The enemy will be here any minute!”</i></p><p>“<i>I don’t 
understand...”</i></p><p>“<i>Hm? What’s to understand? You’re hurt, you need help...and, 
you’re just like us! We have to stick together!”</i></p><p><i>I was still confused, but when 
they both clasped my hands and looked at me...</i></p><p><i>I was 
happy.</i></p><p><u>(Setsuna)</u></p><p>She had been surrounded by darkness back then, and 
she still was now. Setsuna blinked and inwardly shivered as the cold air enveloped her. 
There was someone lying at her feet.</p><p><i>It’s been awhile since I had that dream... 
</i>She turned her back to the body and stepped away. <i>I wasn’t even aware that the dead 
could dream.</i></p><p>Setsuna sighed quietly to herself. She had only regained 
consciousness, but Haruka was long gone. The stoic woman didn’t blame her comrade for her 
actions; in fact, she respected the wind ruler for her logical decision. Where she was now, 
no one could help her.</p><p>The woman peered around the dark void with a growing sense of 
loneliness.</p><p><i>But what does it matter? It’s finally over. </i>She didn’t know how 
many times she had repeated the phrase to herself now. <i>It’s finally over, but...then why 
do I feel this heavy sense of regret? I have dutifully served My Lady to the best of my 
capabilities until the very end. I endured loneliness for so long, that I thought—I thought 
I would be so relieved when I could finally rest! But this...! Even after I’ve passed away, 
I’m alone!</i></p><p><i>I’ve been left behind...</i></p><p><i>I want to see 
you.</i></p><p><b>...Fwooooossssssh... Tup. Tup. Tup.</b></p><p>Setsuna weakly looked up as 
the footsteps drew nearer. Although she no longer possessed a body, she could have sworn 
that the heart in her chest was beating fast. She could scarcely believe it.</p><p>“My 
Lady...” Setsuna stood there frozen as the other woman walked towards her, and stopped a few 
steps away. She didn’t know what to do. She didn’t know what to say; she was finally here, 
but the words she had kept inside for so long would not leave her lips.</p><p>Queen Serenity 
smiled and then extended her hand to the shocked woman. “...Setsuna.”</p><p>There were tears 
welling in Setsuna’s eyes. She couldn’t hold back any longer. “Artemis!” She flung herself 
into the woman’s waiting arms and felt her hug back.</p><p>“I’m sorry! I’m so sorry I 
couldn’t save either of you!”</p><p><i>...I failed you! And I killed him!</i></p><p>Serenity 
said nothing, but continued to cradle her silently in a loving embrace. She held her tight 
and stroked her hair until Setsuna’s sobs subsided. Only once she had calmed down, Queen 
Serenity pulled back to look her dear friend in the eye.</p><p>“Setsuna...what happened back 
then, it wasn’t your fault. There is no need to apologize.”</p><p>Her smile meant to comfort 
her, but it brought Setsuna pain. “But--” She was cut off by a finger on her 
lips.</p><p>Serenity shook her head. “Shhh...You’ve done nothing wrong. Honestly, why do you 
continue to beat yourself up for it?”</p><p>Setsuna averted her gaze. 
“Because...!”</p><p>“It is I, who should apologize.”</p><p>“What?” Setsuna was surprised 
when the other woman cupped her cheek.</p><p>“I passed away so suddenly and left you behind 
to carry this burden all by yourself. You suffered all of these years, alone, for my sake nd 
for that, I am sorry.”</p><p>It was Setsuna’s turn to shake her head. <i>None of that 
matters now...</i></p><p>“I missed you.”</p><p>Serenity smiled. “I missed you too. However, 
I’m afraid that our reunion will have to be postponed for awhile longer.”</p><p>“What?” The 
woman’s crimson eyes widened. “What do you mean? I’m already...”</p><p>Setsuna was surprised 
when her Lady released her, but she did not chase after her. Serenity stepped past her and 
knelt down beside her body.</p><p>“Tell me, Setsuna. Do you...harbour any 
regrets?”</p><p>The question made the woman’s heart skip a beat. “No! Of course not! How 
could I...?”</p><p>“Is that so? But didn’t you just tell me that you regretted not being 
able to save us?” Serenity held her hand over the body’s wounds and a white light was 
emitted. The action confused her friend.</p><p>“What are you doing?” <i>Is she trying to 
heal me? But Haruka already tried that and it failed.</i></p><p>“...There’s still time for 
you.”</p><p>“I don’t understand. I’m dead, aren’t I? I’m right here!”</p><p>“Yes, that’s 
true. If this were any other case, then you would have passed on, just as I have...” There 
was a serious expression on her face as she said this. “Listen, Setsuna. Under any other 
circumstance, your body would have healed this wound. But because of the spiritual levels of 
this dimension, your time has been frozen. Even as we speak, it’s trying to heal 
itself.”</p><p><i>So are you saying that I’m not dead? </i>“But even if that were true, 
nothing will come out of it. It was a spiritual wound.”</p><p>“Correct again. A spiritual 
wound cannot be healed by the living. However...if it were healed by another spiritual 
being...”</p><p>Setsuna’s eyes widened at the implication. Suddenly, she felt dizzy; her 
body’s wound was closing up, but it was re-opening many more.</p><p>“Wait. Artemis...!” Her 
consciousness was fading fast. She was trying to fight it, but it was 
futile.</p><p><i>There’s...still something that you need to do...</i> Serenity smiled back 
at her. It was a smile, but not the same sad one that Setsuna was used to seeing on the Moon 
Kingdom. This was full of warmth.</p><p>“Setsuna...I’ll always be with you. I’ll always be 
waiting...”</p><p>There was a flash of light, and Setsuna’s world went dark.</p><p><u> 
(Minako)</u></p><p>In a black space far away, Minako was only regaining consciousness. The 
young Venusian pushed herself upright into a sitting position and blinked at the darkness. 
Her brow soon furrowed in confusion.</p><p>“Hmm? Where is everyone?” <i>What happened to me? 
The last thing I remember...</i></p><p>As the blonde tried to recollect her memory, two 
figures in the darkness materialized and slowly began to walk towards her. Minako sensed the 
two presences as a third materialized behind her with a blast of wind and 
light.</p><p><i>W-What?! </i>The Venusian shakily turned to see who it was and had expected 
the worse, but it wasn’t the Sun God. A hand holding a garnet staff appeared through the 
portal, followed by the rest of the slender figure. She gasped when she saw Setsuna’s 
crimson eyes meet hers; her power was incredible. Did she always possess this degree of 
strength?</p><p>Setsuna stepped into the realm as the portal disappeared behind her, and hit 
her staff on the black surface of the ground. The sound echoed loudly throughout the 
dimension and startled the faraway individuals.</p><p><i>Setsuna...?</i></p><p>“That is 
enough!” Setsuna ordered in a commanding voice. “You have already suffered enough. Do not 
allow yourselves to be controlled by him any longer!”</p><p>Setsuna raised her staff and the 
jewel at its end began to emit a pink-ish light. The individuals tensed up.</p><p>“With my 
power, I will break the chains that bind you! Now go, and find rest!”</p><p>The light 
engulfed the entire area. Unknown to Minako, the two people in the darkness reverted into 
two spiritual lights and flew towards her. The Venusian yelped when she felt something hit 
her, but when the light faded away there was nothing but darkness once again.</p><p><i>Huh? 
That’s strange... I feel kind of weird. </i>She held her head. “Oh! Setsuna! Is that really 
you?!”</p><p>Setsuna watched the younger woman stand up and looked at her with a determined 
look in her eyes. For a moment, she was worried that the girl was going to declare her an 
imposter and fight her. But then she did something worse; Minako suddenly grabbed onto the 
woman with a suffocating hug and burst into 
tears.</p><p>“Seeeetsuuuuna!!!!!!”</p><p>“Ah...What?”</p><p>“I’m sorry! It’s really good to 
see you! But Rei...” The mention of the name set the young woman off again and Setsuna was 
left trying to figure out what the problem was.</p><p>“What about Rei?” She calmly asked 
her.</p><p>“She--She’s...”</p><p>“Alive.”</p><p>“Huh?” Minako thought her heart skipped a 
beat. Did she hear what she thought she heard? She looked back at Setsuna’s confident 
expression and saw a faint smile on her lips. Minako almost forgot what she had just been 
thinking about. “Are you sure? Do you really mean that?! But she disappeared right in front 
of my eyes!”</p><p>“She is alive.” Setsuna repeated firmly. “And so are the others. They are 
gathering as I speak.”</p><p>“What? Where? I don’t see them anywhere.” She tried looking 
around, but Setsuna’s gaze was focused further in the distance. Through the dimension she 
could sense multiple energy signatures breaking through the space, all chasing after one at 
the very front.</p><p>“We should go.”</p><p>“What? Go where?” Minako watched as Setsuna 
opened a portal comprised of white light, similar to the one she had arrived in.</p><p>“To 
the others... They’re all waiting for us. Rei is waiting for us as well.” She added, and saw 
the Venusian’s face light up. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Minako grinned back. “Yeah,” she 
nodded.</p><p><i>Let’s go!</i></p>
