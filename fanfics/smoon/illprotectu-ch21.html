<h1>I'll Protect You (part 21 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>&quot;We really apologize that we have caused a very huge damage in your 
life&quot; Leonard continued after he announces that Minako lost her memory

Edward bowed his head with shame. Henry and Mark breathes in to prepare 
in case Rei would go berserk and start shouting...or perhaps break down 
in tears

&quot;Rei...I know that you love Minako Aino so much. But in her condition, 
being under observation doesn&#39;t mean she will return the way she used to 
be. And you&#39;ve known her for how long? Seven days? Do you think she will 
still feel the same way?&quot; Grey carefully said

Rei stared blankly at them. She could not even believe that she&#39;s 
hearing it. Minako lost her memory from the accident. She noticed the 
young and handsome men in front of her are shrugging uncomfortably, they 
must be expecting something emotional from her. She breathes the best 
air she can before looking back at Grey

&quot;It&#39;s like you&#39;re telling me to just forget her. I suggest you all to 
stay out of my love life starting now...That&#39;s my own problem to solve. 
Now get started with the meeting before my patience gets thin again&quot; Rei 
said as walks past the young men and sat to the nearest glass chair and 
crossed her legs and arms as if she&#39;s not interested on whatever they&#39;re 
going to discuss

The five young men looked at each other then took their seat to start 
the meeting

--An hour later--

After the meeting Rei went back straight to her room. She was surprised 
when she saw her private nurse Minerva arrange some elegant clothes on 
her bed. The nurse sensed her presence and greeted her

&quot;Welcome back Ms. Rei! I was just arranging the clothes Master Edward 
had ordered for you from the internet. He really knows what will look 
good on you!&quot; Minerva merrily said

Rei looked at the clothes for a minute. She took a pair that she liked 
and went straight to the changing room without saying anything. Minerva 
smiled as she hangs the rest of the clothes inside the cabinet

After few minutes of waiting, Rei finally came out. She is now wearing a 
simple white long sleeve blouse and slacks. She lazily kicked the heels 
she was wearing minutes ago and walked with her bare feet towards the 
terrace and stared blankly at the nothingness of fields again. Minako 
will be arriving tomorrow. She wanted to see her again. But Sanctuary 
will not allow her for sure

Rei massaged her temples with her left hand, begging her mind to come up 
with an idea. But since her head is still achy, she could not 
concentrate. She sighed, she started to feel uneasy, and she&#39;s starting 
to blame herself on what happened to her beloved Minako. If she were 
only strong enough, Minako could have been safe and unharmed. It was 
because Sanctuary wanted her that Minako was involved and became a 
victim

&#39;Maybe I really need to let go of Minako. To forget about her...&#39;

The thought made Rei gasped and collapse in sitting position. How can 
she ever think of that? She shook her head again and again, ignoring her 
injured neck

Minerva rushed on her side and helped the raven-haired girl stand up

&quot;Ms. Rei, I think you should rest. You&#39;ve exhausted your energy when you 
are walking back here awhile ago&quot;

Rei did not protest this time. But she refused to lie down on her bed. 
Instead she just sat and stared blankly at her feet. Minerva did not 
force her to rest and went out to get her lunch

--

Outside Rei&#39;s room Minerva saw Edward leaning beside the raven-haired 
girl&#39;s door. Edward fixed his composure and faced the nurse

&quot;How is she?&quot; Edward whispered

Minerva sighed then answered

&quot;She&#39;s exhausted. I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll even eat her lunch, Master 
Edward&quot;

&quot;...I see. I&#39;ll just talk to her later then. Make sure she will eat her 
lunch&quot; Edward said before he left the corridor

--

--Back at Tokyo--

All sorts of guards and police gather in the airport for they are 
assigned to ensure Minako&#39;s safe trip back to London. The security is so 
strict that not even a single media is allowed to enter the airport. 
Some of the scheduled flights that evening were moved to a delayed time

Minako waits patiently in the secured van together with her parents and 
Wendy, her ever supportive manager. She curiously stares outside the car 
window. She couldn&#39;t believe the number of police around the van they 
are riding. Is she that special to have this kind of security? The only 
thing that she knows is she needs to go to London and undergo 
rehabilitation for her to remember everything, little by little. She had 
no idea that it will be this complicated. She looked at Wendy who seems 
to be checking her scheduler. Minako hesitated a bit, but she continued 
and opened her mouth to speak

&quot;M-Ms. Wendy, do I really have to go to London and remember everything 
there? I think the specialists here in Tokyo are great as well. How 
about we just stay and do my medications here?&quot; Minako asked

Wendy was surprised to hear the pop star speak and start a conversation. 
But the Minako who is talking to her right now is different. So not 
Minako who used to be loud and cheerful. Wendy smiled weakly

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ain-Minako. I know your home is here. It&#39;s just for two 
months and we&#39;ll go back here okay?&quot; Wendy explained

Minako nodded, she looked uncertain and blank but nodded anyway. She 
turned her head to her mother, who immediately smiled

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, dear. It&#39;s for your own good&quot;

&quot;Are you going to stay with me there until I go back?&quot; Minako asked

Mrs. Aino looked at Wendy and then to her husband, Mr. Aino

&quot;We&#39;ll worry about that later okay? Here, take these and start listening 
to it. The songs in that Discman are all sung by you&quot; Mrs. Aino said as 
she hands the Discman to her daughter. Minako silently listened to it 
while her eyes were fixed back to the policemen outside their van. Wendy 
was relieved that Mrs. Aino managed to drive Minako&#39;s attention off the 
subject

Few minutes later Minako and the rest boarded the plane. Minako can&#39;t 
sleep. Is she excited? Definitely not. Maybe she&#39;s worried. She&#39;s been 
wondering what would become of her after she remembers everything. She&#39;s 
been thinking. Someone should be with her, but doesn&#39;t know who. She 
could not remember of course. Minako gave it up for the night and 
continued listening to her songs hoping it would make her sleep while in 
journey.

--

Why do I always find you so beautiful?

Why can&#39;t I stand a second without you?

Is it because I love you?

Oh, yes. That&#39;s because I love you

Your voice is like an angel

Your eyes are like the sea

Your hair is as soft as air

Your presence is intoxicating

I feel like new when I&#39;m with you

So please baby stay

And I&#39;ll take care of you

If I see you cry, or even frown

It makes me want to scream

If I can&#39;t make you happy

If I can&#39;t...I will be useless

Please be my angel

Please fly me to the sea

Let me breathe the air you breathe

Let me feel your presence

And fix me like I&#39;m new

So please baby stay

With you smiling at me, I would know it&#39;s not a dream

If you&#39;re not here, I&#39;d rather be useless

--

Minako was surprised when the same song played again for some unknown 
reason. She did not stop it. Instead she listened to the lyrics

&#39;Very ordinary. Nothing is really special with the song. It&#39;s just about 
a person with a sad past and gets strength from a loved one&#39; Minako 
thought

&#39;Wait&#39;

Minako looked at her parents, to Wendy, and her staff. Aside from her 
parents, the people around her seem to be her very good friends. Is she 
still single? Does she have someone special or someone more than a 
friend? New things came through her mind. New questions started to 
flood. Minako sighed

&#39;I don&#39;t want to ask anybody anymore, even Ms. Wendy or my parents. I 
know I&#39;ll remember it eventually...But it would feel great if you get 
your strength from someone you love. Maybe this song&#39;s not bad at all&#39; 
she smiled to herself

--

--Back at Sanctorium--

A knock was heard from Rei&#39;s door

&quot;What is it, Minerva?&quot; Rei asked with disinterest as she reads a book

&quot;It&#39;s me Rei. Edward&quot; Said the gentle voice behind the door

&quot;What do you need?&quot;

&quot;Can I please talk to you for just a few minutes?&quot; Edward replied. His 
hand shaking a bit while he caresses his face with a soft feather

Few seconds later Rei opened the door for Edward and allowed the 
handsome man inside

&quot;Do you need anything?&quot; Rei asked, sensing Edward&#39;s uneasiness

&quot;Well...I&#39;m...first of all I want to say sorry&quot;

&quot;Sorry for what?&quot;

&quot;For breaking my promise about Ms. Aino&quot; Edward looked straight into 
Rei&#39;s eyes. Rei believed that he did not mean to break it

&quot;You don&#39;t need to apologize. I...I&#39;ve depended too much on you. And I 
should be protecting Minako. I&#39;m sorry I said some things that might 
have hurt you&quot; Rei felt uneasy apologizing. The only people she 
apologized can be counted by her fingers

&quot;No, I should. I made a promise that I wasn&#39;t able to fulfill-&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re finish on that subject. What else are you going to tell me?&quot; Rei 
cut him off

Edward sighed. Rei is as forward as ever

&quot;I...I actually wanted to ask if you can come with me tomorrow&quot;

&quot;Is it my first mission with you guys?&quot;

&quot;Not actually. It&#39;s a part of our preparation&quot;

&quot;Then why are you asking instead of telling me? If it&#39;s a preparation 
then I should cooperate right?&quot; Rei asked suspiciously. Edward thought 
of Rei&#39;s answer. He stood up and smiled. It&#39;s the first time Rei saw 
Edward smiling. The hazel-haired man walked towards the door and opened 
it to leave

&quot;Perhaps you&#39;re correct. Please wear whatever you want tomorrow morning. 
We will buy the things you need. And...&quot; Edward paused and looked at 
Rei&#39;s amethyst eyes again

&quot;...You&#39;ll be seeing someone tomorrow. Thank you for your time Rei&quot; 
Finally Edward shut the door. Leaving Rei with a questioning look

&quot;...I hate it when they leave me wondering&quot; Rei lazily laid herself on 
her bed

&#39;I wonder what Minako is doing right now. She must be preparing her 
things for tomorrow. What does Minako look like? Now that she doesn&#39;t 
remember anything...I wish I could stay with her. I wish I&#39;m with her at 
this moment. Will she remember me?&#39;

Rei shifted uncomfortably on her bed several times. She couldn&#39;t sleep. 
Now she knows what Minako felt when she left the pop star in the hotel 
to retrieve the CD she bought

Rei finally felt her eyes closing. She remembered how Minako sung a part 
of her song to Rei. The way Minako sung it. Nobody will ever see Minako 
sing that way. Rei wanted to see and hear Minako sing that way again. 
Only for her

&#39;Minako, once I have the opportunity, I&#39;ll make you remember me&#39;

--

--Morning came, Sanctorium--

Rei woke up early since she could not sleep properly last night. She&#39;s 
still adjusting on her new room. Wearing the clothes that Minerva 
suggested, she comes out of the room straight to the living room. But 
the living room is empty. She heard an engine sound nearby. Rei looked 
at the window, but she couldn&#39;t see anything

Out of curiosity Rei walked to the main entrance of the mansion. She was 
surprised that the guards just opened the door for her, as if she&#39;s 
expected outside. She noticed the guards who opened the door followed 
her, but she didn&#39;t mind.

Rei followed the sound she heard earlier. She discovered it is coming 
from a private jet at the northwest side outside the mansion. She 
finally saw Mark and the rest of Sanctuary

&quot;Good morning, Hino-chan. Just in time. You&#39;re about to depart. Mark and 
Grey will accompany you and they will explain everything on the way&quot; 
Mark greeted

&quot;Why do you keep on planning things behind me first then tell me 
afterwards?&quot; Asked Rei, obviously pissed again

&#39;Am I a part of Sanctuary now or what?&#39;

&quot;Actually is not Sanctuary&#39;s plan, Rei. Edward just asked for Mark&#39;s 
permission this morning. So basically, this is Edward&#39;s plan&quot; said 
Henry, the blondish white-haired man beside Mark

&quot;Good Morning, Rei&quot; Edward followed, while Grey at the back waiving and 
smiling at her

&#39;Does this jerk need to come with us?&#39; Rei thought as she looked 
annoyingly at Grey

Few minutes later the plane takes off along with Rei, Edward and Grey

--

--Inside the Private Plane--

&quot;What&#39;s with the private plane?&quot; Asked the curious policewoman

&quot;We&#39;re going to London. That&#39;s where we&#39;ll go shopping&quot; Grey replied

&quot;...And that&#39;s where Minako will be arriving later&quot; Edward said, looking 
at the window of the private plane

Before Rei can speak Grey interrupted

&quot;I&#39;ve overheard from Edward and Mark this morning. Mark allowed you to 
see Minako. But it only means we can&#39;t go near or talk to her. After 
that, we&#39;ll go shopping, &#39;kay?&quot; Grey winked at her

Rei looked from Grey to Edward, who is still looking at the window. 
Then, she silently nodded

It&#39;s Rei&#39;s first time to ride a private plane. Rei may not show it, but 
she&#39;s glad she&#39;s going to see Minako again. She&#39;s also glad she&#39;s not 
bored because Grey kept on asking her about things without any sense, 
leading to small argument between the two of them. Edward silently watch 
them argue, finding it amusing and a bit fun

An hour later there is now a deafening silence between the three of 
them. Grey ran out of ideas how to entertain them and Rei focused her 
mind on seeing Minako again. Edward sighed and started talking

&quot;...This is the same plane we used to bring you in Edinburgh...&quot;

Rei looked up, a bit surprised that Edward finally spoke

&quot;Rei, what are you going to do after seeing Minako?&quot; Edward asked

Rei did not actually think of that until now

&quot;...actually I don&#39;t know yet&quot; Rei frowned

--

--London, Airport-few hours later--

Minako and the others finally arrived in London. They were immediately 
surrounded by guards but this time there are also lots of media. Minako 
was a bit annoyed with the flashes of different cameras and tons of 
questions she doesn&#39;t know what to answer. They were lead by her 
bodyguards to a first class lounge

&quot;Minako, are you alright? Do you need some rest already?&quot; Mrs. Aino 
asked her daughter as she gives her a cup of hot chocolate

Minako shook her head

&quot;I&#39;m fine mom. Thanks&quot; She replied and started to drink. She saw Wendy 
walking towards them. The manager looks tired but still in composure

&quot;Mrs. Aino, I apologize for making you and Mr. Aino wait here. The Limo 
that will drive us to the hotel will be arriving anytime now, please 
bear with me&quot; Wendy explained

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Ms. Wendy. It&#39;s alright&quot; Mrs. Aino replied waiving her hand

While waiting for the Limo, Mr. and Mrs. Aino are in conversation with 
Wendy. Minako&#39;s staff already went home after arriving. Minako is now 
bored. She took the Discman her mom gave her and started playing her CD 
to listen

--

--On the other end of the same lounge--

Ever since Minako arrived and stayed in the lounge Rei never took her 
eyes off the woman she fell in love for a week. Minako looks a lot 
different now. She looks timid. Her usual sparkling blue eyes seem to be 
covered with doubt and sadness, her healthy lips now as pale as her 
skin. It seems that she also lost some weight. But she is still 
beautiful. Rei looked at her very love miserably

&#39;If only I can run there and hug you right now. And tell you how much I 
worried and think about you, how much I missed you...how much I love 
you&#39; Rei thought

She, Edward and Grey are just meters away from where Minako is right 
now. They are sitting on the other end of the lounge. Rei wore a thick 
furry white hat, shades and is holding a pocket book to hide her face. 
Rei&#39;s hands are weakening. The book she&#39;s holding slowly slides down. 
Edward noticed it and held it up for her

&quot;Rei, remember what we&#39;ve said earlier. Minako&#39;s manager and parents 
know who you are. We need to hide your identity. Please understand&quot; 
Edward explained. Rei nodded weakly, trying very hard to control herself 
from madly running towards Minako

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, cop girl. Leonard will keep a track on her. You&#39;ll see her 
again&quot; Grey said as he taps Rei&#39;s shoulder

Grey looked at his watch and looked at both Rei and Edward

&quot;Rei I know you need more time but Mark only gave us the whole morning 
and afternoon. We need to go now so we can go back early&quot;

Rei said nothing. She nodded weakly again and stood up, closing the book 
that was covering her face moments ago. They finally left the lounge. 
Rei looked at Minako again for the last time then turned her head to 
follow Edward and Grey. She stopped the tears from coming out of her 
eyes

--

--Meanwhile on the other side

Minako&#39;s eyes are wandering around as she looks at her surroundings. The 
people in the first class lounge looks very formal and hard to approach. 
She&#39;s wondering what she&#39;s doing there. As the next song in her Discman 
played, she caught a glimpse of a raven-haired woman walking out of the 
lounge together with two handsome men. She thought it&#39;s a waste to see 
that long hair to be covered by a thick white hat. Minako&#39;s thoughts 
were cut when Wendy called her

&quot;Minako, let&#39;s go. The car&#39;s here&quot;

&#39;For me to know you&#39;re safe is enough for now. I hope I&#39;ll see you 
sooner&#39;
