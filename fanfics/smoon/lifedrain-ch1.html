<h1>The Life-Drainer Caper (Always You & Me, No Matter What)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kanzaki.html">Ms. Kanzaki</a><br> </h2>
<pre>TeNou Haruka removed the headphones, and threw the book in her hands:

- Damn! Why did I ever let Michiru convince me of learning Spanish? It&#39;s
so complicated I can&#39;t follow a single letter at all!

&quot;Bloody language! All because she said &#39;you must know all the major
languages of the world, TeNou-san; and if you want to go to the Spanish
Embassy party with me you have to be able to communicate with them&#39;. I
spent a minute or two cursing the language, the lessons, and, after that
show I put on,	I looked at her, and said &#39;is there anything you don&#39;t
know, smart one?&#39; She teased me very well, replying that the only thing
she haven&#39;t figured out is how to make me less stubborn. After that she
placed the headphones over my head and the book in my hand. I was
listening to that grammar stuff, and next thing I know is that she
disappeared with Setsuna and Hotaru!&quot;

She grabbed her transformation pen and played with it for a while. Her
thoughts drifted to a certain place in her mind, where her soul kept the
treasures of her memories. She let them drag her out of  the boredom, and
her face adopted a warm gesture.

&quot;One of my favorites is the time when I made the most important decision
in my life: fulfilling my destiny and becoming Sailor Uranus. I remember
well how Michiru, after defeating the monster, spoke of her choice, and
through her words I guessed her emotions toward me. I held her in my arms,
I saw how injured she was, and I lost fear of the me I tried so hard to
deny. I only knew I wanted to be with her, share the pains, the joyful
moments, everything. I just couldn&#39;t leave her...&quot; Haruka tried to return
to her lessons and pressed &#39;play&#39; on the walkman. &quot;Oh, damn, damn, DAMN!!!
I can&#39;t take these things anymore!&quot;. She set apart the headphones and the
book, and headed to the patio.

&quot;When you need a breather, especially when you&#39;re alone, the right remedy
is to go out&quot;. The tall, blond girl knew that. So she decided to
contemplate the wonders that surrounded her home, and inmediately the roar
of the nearby sea came to her. Haruka wanted to admire the beauty of the
night, that&#39;s why she stepped outside and walked along the shore.

It seemed awfully dark. There were no stars, no moon, and, to make matters
worse, no wind. But Haruka didn&#39;t mind. If she just looked outside she
could see the ocean, waves curling and breaking. And with the name of
Michiru whispered into the air, that was enough to make it all special.

&quot;It&#39;ll be certainly the last time I _ever_ inhabit a fisherman&#39;s body!&quot;,
the creature assured as it slipped in the ocean. He consumed the life
energy all too fast, and the weakness he suffered was too intense for him
to try to steer the ship to shore. Since he needed a new body, he thought
the current would take him soon to dry land.

&quot;Hope Michiru comes back soon&quot;, she thought. &quot;Setsuna and Hotaru went
along with her this morning to Tokio, but where? And why didn&#39;t they
invite me along? Well, maybe girls&#39; day out&quot;, she snickered at the last
phrase. She found interesting the contrast of her laughter with the crash
of the currents against the sharp, green-mossed rocks, and stopped right
there to feel the cold ocean spray.

Kicking and bracing a bit got him more weak. Life was literally peeling
off him. What used to be most of his flesh was now floating around him.
Even with his eye sockets empty, he knew that somewhere the body he needed
was there. Any body would do, survival was all too important to assume the
ridiculous poses of a select consumer -maybe this one, it&#39;s far more
taller; maybe the other, more brains-. He could now feel the salt water
chilling his bones, he thought a good payback was staining the blue with
the dark red blood running out his gushing wounds... The body! He needs a
Goddamn body fast!

Haruka was glad that a breeze started blowing. Ah! The pure sensation of
air running against her face! In her opinion, the best joy she could
receive was when she would run against the wind, challenging that mighty
spirit to a speed duel, and her feet moved quickly to the invitation. &quot;You
always beat me, wind, yet we&#39;re still the best of friends&quot; Faster and
faster she went, though, determined to stop only when her body prayed &#39;no
more&#39;, faster and faster. &quot;If only Michiru could see me now...&quot; She smiled
just imagining the expression of her soul companion, the only one she
loved more than her wind, than anything else.

The shore was close now! What a relief! However, how would he find anyone
nearby? A quest indeed, a tough one, and, if it took too long, a deadly
one. Then he felt relief: no need to look around. He had sensed the
presence of a lifeform. &quot;A strong one, I can tell. Its aura spreads
vastly... I must have it!&quot; Expert hunter, he quieted down all his
functions: undetection is essencial to fool and capture the prey.

- Serena! If you&#39;re going to help me prepare Haruka&#39;s birthday cake you
can start by not eating all the cherries I destined for it!!- complained
out loud Lita, shaking her head in disapprooval.

      - I&#39;m sorry, they just seemed  _sooo_  good! And they taste good
too!- whimpered Serena, having a bit of the &quot;evidence&quot; in her mouth -May I
least finish them? You&#39;re going to have to buy a new jar anyway...

      - What?! You finished them all?! I might kill you for that, but
tomorrow&#39;s the party and I still have time to go out and get them.

      Raye showed up, in her temple maiden outfit, contrasting the red and
white colors of the suit in a curious way with her long black hair. Along
with her came Amy, Mina, Reeny, Michiru, Setsuna and Hotaru. Luna and
Artemis, the two cats, were already asleep.

      - I see Serena did it again- she said in her mocking tone- Lita, you
should know that, for these matters, you just can&#39;t trust her. In fact,
you can&#39;t trust her for ANYTHING.

      Serena stood up, and put that hostile gaze in her deep blue eyes.

      - Better cut it out, Raye! I&#39;m not in the mood to stand your
remarks.- She complemented her words with her tongue sticking out.

      -The same to you!- Raye perfectly imitated the gesture.

      Amy&#39;s &quot;calm-down-and-talk-it-over-in-a-civilized-manner&quot; voice was
heard then:

      - Girls, please! After all, Haruka&#39;s birthday is tomorrow. We have
time enough to spare and make all the preparations to perfection.

      - I couldn&#39;t agree more with you, Amy- Michiru said.- You&#39;re all
very generous to help us out with this &quot;mission&quot;, I hope it all works out
as planned... - She then checked the hour in her gold detailed wrist
watch, and realized that Setsuna, Hotaru and helself had to be back home-
Have to leave, girls! Haruka never forgives anyone missing dinner at the
table. 

      - Besides that she&#39;ll probably get suspicious- Setsuna added.

      - See you all tomorrow then!- Michiru, Setsuna and Hotaru departed
as they waved goodbye to the rest.

      - Goodbye!- Serena replied. She looked at the room. The whole place
was decorated specifically for next day, it was simply great.-Gee! I can&#39;t
wait for the party!- She giggled in her particular way, and that made the
tension in the place disappear, having everyone agree with her.

      Haruka must have ran a mile or so. She was pleased at herself, how
she beat her own record, and that it was more merit-deserving due to the
fact that she did it on sand. And with very dark scenary. She guided
herself as if she was in broad daylight. She sat down and smelled once
more the whiff of the ocean breeze. Glorious smell! If Michiru were only
here...

      Then again she wasn&#39;t alone. &quot;Odd&quot;. Her senses could tell her that
something strange was floating towards the shore. She focused her eyes on
the object, and stood from a wise distance to wait for the currents to
make it arrive. 

      &quot; Whoa! What&#39;s this?!This turns my bliss night into one of those
terror inspired times of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; Just viewing those human remains
that just washed up there was enough to make her nauseated. She
cross-examined them from her place, how they had so little flesh on them
those bones, and how their dark red blood soiled of an eerie way the water
and the sand around. Whatever happened to this poor soul must have been
horrifying, and Haruka wondered what could&#39;ve caused such mishap. 

       She stared into those empty sockets of the jaw-opened skull, so
bloodied. &quot;I can swear it  actually sees me, but it&#39;s good &amp; dead&quot;. She
decided to step closer to the cadaver, to make a full evaluation of the
incident. 

       Again her eyes pointed towards were the cadaver had his once, it
was such a gloomy sight. Haruka kneeled. &quot;That&#39;s why I&#39;ll write down in my
will to be cremated! Euw! Decomposure sure stinks!&quot; She noticed the hands 
-or whatever was left- were tightly closed, as if they were grasping
something between them. Curiosity killed the cat, but not her. After many,
many battles as a Sailor Senshi she couldn&#39;t fear anything, and certainly
NOT the remains of some stranger. She will get to the bottom of this, even
if it kills her.

       All of a sudden Haruka heard a heavy breathing, she turned her head
to determine where it came from. To her surprise, a sloppy-felt hand
gripped her ankle, it was so tight she could almost feel her bones
begining to crack. The cadaver was alive!

       - You are exactly what I&#39;m looking for!	I will take your body!

       TeNou Haruka heard the grave-deep voice the creature had. It
seemingly affected her. &quot;Must have some hypnotic use, like a snake does
with its eyes.&quot; She snapped herself out of it, and tried to shake him off.


       - I don&#39;t know what the hell you are, but you&#39;re about to get what
you deserve, worm-breath!- She spoke menacingly, and reached down to her
pants&#39; pocket for her transformation pen- You&#39;ll be pretty sorry you
messed with me!

	 - Your power won&#39;t work on me, fool! Can&#39;t be allowed to such an
advantage over me!

	 The creature knocked the pen from her hand. Haruka realized she
was in deeper problems than originaly thought. Again the voice did its
hypnotic effect, and she froze for a moment before she started to struggle
out of his grip with more strength. But she couldn&#39;t feel the hand no
more. Where&#39;s the corpse? Where did it go? She felt her head spin, and her
body ache all over. She must get out of here!, that&#39;s all what came up in
her mind. The pain, however, stopped her from getting up, and increased
its burden. This time she couldn&#39;t take it anymore, and screamed her soul
out. 

		   -Michiru! Watch where you&#39;re going!- advised Setsuna
after her friend almost hit a road sign.

		   The beautiful girl with the sea-colored hair  took her
hand to her forehead, as if a migraine affected her. She certainly felt
something wrong. 

		   - I&#39;m sorry, Setsuna. I lost my concentration for a
second, that&#39;s all.

		   Setsuna, with all the wisdom age had given her, knew
that wasn&#39;t the reason. 

		   -KaiOu-san, that&#39;s not it. Even your color paled a bit,
like if you had a bad dream. 

		   Michiru kept her attention to the road. She then
murmured:

		   - Something happened to Haruka. I felt it.

		   - How sure are you of  it?- asked Setsuna in worried
tone. She was of the opinion that a heart-felt vision was not to be
underestimated.

		   - I&#39;m not sure... It was so brief, yet so intense...
Haruka was in terrible pain, and in my mind her screams echoed... I&#39;m not
sure, it was too brief, Setsuna.

		   Hotaru, who was listening attentively in the back seat,
put her hand on Michiru&#39;s shoulder.

		   - Don&#39;t worry, Michiru-mama. Haruka-papa&#39;s strong and
the most independent soul I&#39;ve encountered. She can take care of herself.

		   Michiru smiled at this comment. She knew how strong and
independent TeNou Haruka was, better than anyone else. And, speaking of
strength, she couldn&#39;t wait to embrace tightly Haruka when she got home,
to be close in a manner of not letting go. &quot;But that vision doesn&#39;t let me
be at peace, I _must_ get there quick!&quot;

		   There was an inmense light on the beach that night. For
a number of seconds it shone intensly, and it gradually reduced itself to
a blue neon aura, that surrounded a figure lying down. It finally stood
up, and the appearance was basicly TeNou Haruka&#39;s, except for a raven-dark
hair and a strange glare in the eyes. It  smiled, such a perverse smile,
and laughed wickedly, permitting the breeze to carry out its awful message
out loud.

		   &quot;Finally home!&quot; Michiru stepped out first, and rather
hurried. She already had the keys ready and flinged the door open.

		   -Haruka! Haruka!- she called out as she ran across the
stairs and the hall. &quot;This is not good at all!&quot;

		   Hotaru came almost behind her, and said:

		   - Probably she&#39;s walking by the shore, as she always
does, Michiru-mama. In that case, she&#39;ll be back before bedtime.

		   Michiru went right to the balcony in her room. She
inmediately caught the breeze and the smell it spread. &quot;Hotaru may be
right. Haruka must have sensed the wind and ran against it, as she usually
loves ...&quot; And she recalled that infernal echo. She took from the drawer
in her night table her communicating wristwatch, inspected Haruka&#39;s room
to see if  she left hers behind. &quot;No, she didn&#39;t. She&#39;s so cautious, and
almost never leaves without it.&quot; She tried to get an answer.

		   -Haruka! Haruka! Please answer! Haruka!

		   Setsuna was now worried. It wasn&#39;t usual for Michiru to
be this anxious. Hotaru  had the same conclusion.

		   - Michiru, come with us. We&#39;ll search for TeNou-san
around the area.

		  While the other two were checking every inch of the
property, Michiru KaiOu headed for the area she knew Haruka loved most of
the beach. It was about a mile far, and she hurried as much as her legs
allowed her. &quot;Haruka would surely be nagging me of not being an
acomplished speedster as she is. &#39; You&#39;re fast on water, but too slow on
land, darling!&#39; &#39;At least that&#39;s somewhere you can&#39;t call your domain,
Haruka!&#39;, I&#39;d reply back, teasing her with just a glance... These are her
footprints...&quot; And there wasn&#39;t much to follow because the tide, due to
the breeze, rose a bit wild. 

		  She started back when she saw something between the sand
slopes. She reached down and took it out: it was Haruka&#39;s transformation
pen. NOW she was extremely worried.

		 -It&#39;s way past midnight and I can&#39;t get _any_ sleep!-
complained Serena.- Oh, those cherries must have indigested me!

		 Reeny and Luna woke. After all, who wouldn&#39;t with
Serena&#39;s voice wailing her misfortune?

		- Can you be quiet?- yawned Reeny- We&#39;re trying to sleep
here and we don&#39;t mind whatever you&#39;re going through &#39;cause you surely
deserve it!

		- Why, you... You&#39;re a lot worse than Raye!- replied
Tsukino Serena, clutching her pillow and ready to throw it at the little
pink haired child.

		- Take it easy, Serena- said Luna, stretching a bit  as
all cats do. - Just go downstairs and have an antacid.

		-All right! All right! I didn&#39;t think of that. Thanks,
Luna.

		Serena stepped down carefully, she didn&#39;t want to wake up
the family. As she got to the final step she heard the phone ring, and she
almost slipped with the floor mat next to the stairs. Fortunately, she
held to the rail and made it to the phone.

	       -Whew! That was a close one!- she told herself as she
picked up the auricular.-Who could it ... Hello?Setsuna! Hi! What&#39;s up?
Huh? I hope it&#39;s not serious... Oh, I see. I&#39;ll call the rest and be right
there.

	      Luna and Reeny heard when Serena opened her closet and began
dressing. They looked at her and asked at the same time &#39;What&#39;s going on,
Serena? Why are you dressing at this time of night?&#39;.

	      -Something came up!- she replied- Haruka has dissappered.

	     Only a couple of hours ago they were here in the Hikawa dojo
preparing everything for Haruka&#39;s birthday party. To think this made
Serena feel more concerned about the problem, and couldn&#39;t help notice
Michiru a bit frantic.

	      -Michiru, surely this is a tough time for you, but please
calm down and lets try to examine the situation thoroughly.

	      -Thank you, Serena. But the scream was horrible! I only fear
the worst...

	      She then put her head down.

	      Darien, standing by the doorway and feeling the same as
Serena, went over to Michiru&#39;s side. He raised with his hand her face, and
smiled.

	      - We shouldn&#39;t jump to conclusions so soon. Serena&#39;s right,
we should examine the situation. I suggest we start by searching every
place she frequented in Tokio. Can you write them down, Michiru? It&#39;ll be
more orderly and also help you calm down.

	      Michiru asked for a pen and paper. Soon she had the list,
and handed it over to Darien and the others. As they were reading it, she
said in a dispirited tone:

	      - We won&#39;t find her anywhere... It&#39;s just not like her to
leave that way!

	      Setsuna then approached Michiru:

	      - You&#39;ve been wanting to ask me if I know anything of this
ordeal, KaiOu-san. I&#39;d like to help you, but I&#39;m sorry. I can&#39;t interfere.

	      Michiru understood every word MeiOu said. It was all up to
Destiny to unravel.

	      -It&#39;s curious how the Guardian of The Time Lanes believes in
Destiny, having the power to change what she wishes at her will.

	      - Please don&#39;t be bitter about this, Michiru. You&#39;re not
acting like yourself at all! Calm down and think straight.

	      Michiru breathed in deeply.

	      - You&#39;re right, as always, wise Setsuna. I&#39;m not focusing
correctly. 

	      MeiOu Setsuna smiled.

	       -I&#39;m glad to see the intelligent, pacient KaiOu-san take
over. Now lets go with the others and begin the search.

	       KaiOu Michiru nodded. She stood from the ground and headed
towards her car. She made a strong promise to find Haruka. She looked into
her deep aqua mirror, and the image was identical to her vision. The image
of TeNou-san aching and that hellish echo spurted her energies. &quot;I must
help her!&quot;

	      The loud melody of a rock song and merchants announcing
their sales over megaphones was heard over the streets close to the #10
Public Park. There was a sell-out at the local shopping stores, and a
swarm of people crowded the area.  

	      -This is the main reason I hate sidewalk sales! Look at all
these people! Don&#39;t they have anything better to do?

	      - Hmmm,- posed pensative Lita at Mina&#39;s remarks- they could
be saying the same about us.

	      -Our presence here, however, is for a good reason,- said
Aino Mina as she shook her blonde head-Oh! Did you see that? Shoes at half
price!

	      -I thought we were looking for Haruka, Mina-. Lita couldn&#39;t
believe it, but from Mina anything was possible.

	      By their side brushed down a tall stranger, wearing a black
trench coat. There was something about him that called their attention.
For a minute they could&#39;ve sworn they saw Haruka... Then again, by
glancing at him, they noticed he had dark hair, as dark as a
bottom-lacking hole. They returned to their concern, finding their friend.

	      Amy, Raye, Reeny and Hotaru circled downtown many times. Not
a trace, it seems. They even asked Andrew if Haruka had been to the
arcade, he only gave them a &#39;no&#39;. 

	      -This is not turning out- said Amy, at the same time she was
typing data into her computer- And I won&#39;t have information until 10
minutes later.

	      -Lets try to use common sense- Reeny raised her finger to
point out her idea- Michiru should tell us about the search she had done
on the beach.

	      Hotaru shook her head in disapproval.

	     - It wouldn&#39;t help anyway, Reeny. I was there, and all
Michiru found was Haruka&#39;s transformation pen, about a mile from the
house.

	     Raye was busy concentrating, trying to perceive TeNou&#39;s aura.

	     -I can&#39;t feel her color anywhere! Amy, have the information
yet?

	     -No, Raye, I said this would take ten minutes minimum...
Hotaru, you said the transformation pen was found about a mile from the
house? My opinion is that we inspect that scene again.

	     -Not to worry, computer whiz.- replied Raye- I think Serena
and the rest are on it.- She then returned to her attempts to find
Haruka&#39;s aura, concentrating and concentrating. Then they heard a scream
coming from an alley nearby. 

	     - Quick! We have to get there!- urged Hino Raye. Her sixth
sense could tell her that an answer would be given there.

	     Despite the crowd that started gathering the entrance of the
alley, Mizuno Amy and Raye managed to sneek through. As soon as they
arrived they heard a weak voice pleading for help. Amy kneeled down, and
took the girl&#39;s pulse.

	     - It seems like something drained her life energy. I don&#39;t
think she&#39;ll survive.

	     - You mean like a vampire?- asked Reeny

	     -Almost, just that blood wasn&#39;t the objetive. Life energy was
sucked from her.

	      Raye closed her eyes, and seemed to make contact with the
air surrounding the place. She later opened them, and said:

	      - A very evil spirit did this job. Its goal is to mantain
its power at high peek by gathering life energy. I&#39;ve never felt this kind
of aura, it probably belongs to another world or stuff like that.
There&#39;s... there&#39;s something else, girls.

	      - What is it, Raye?

	      - The aura also includes a  faint trace of a human one. It
seems to be its disguise.

	      Morning suns, with their lovely coloring to the ocean, were
Michiru&#39;s favorites. Even with this anxiety pressing her chest, watching
the velvet turn to gold of the sky reflect in the water was comforting.
She guided Serena, Darien and Setsuna to the place where she found the
transformation pen.

	      -It&#39;s beautiful here, Michiru! It&#39;s like the shore in that
movie Darien loves. I think it&#39;s called &quot;From Here To Inanity&quot;...

	      -&quot;From Here To Eternity&quot;, Serena- corrected in a sweet tone
the handsome Darien.- Now that we&#39;re in the presence of daylight, Michiru,
can you distinguish anything that&#39;s odd?

	      KaiOu Michiru walked around the zone, looked through, and
repeated these a couple of times. Then her look fixed on something. She
headed to the rocks near the shore, and found a piece of clothing. It was
evidently attached to something, since it wasn&#39;t common for such a piece
to weigh the quantity her hand felt. 

	    -Darien, help me, please.

	     Darien Chiba assisted her, and their joint forces pulled out
a carcass, a human one, possible to tell by the bones. Its aspect was all
too chilling: almost fleshless, bloodied and still with &quot;a facial
expression proper of a Hell&#39;s soul prisoner as described by Dante&quot;,
believed KaiOu Michiru.

	    -God! Does he looks like _he_ had a bad day!- exclaimed
Serena.

	    -Maybe a bad day too long- added Setsuna- But I detect remains
of a strange force in this body. I can&#39;t quite determine it...

	     Michiru gazed at the decrepit thing. The empty sockets were
just too depressing to inspire respect. &quot;Only pity&#39;s the emotion anyone
can render you, poor bum. My intuition tells me you had a lot to do with
Haruka&#39;s disappearence! For now I can&#39;t connect you to the incident. If
you were only alive... I&#39;d probably either torture or beg you to tell me
everything! &quot;

	     She stopped thinking. She didn&#39;t want to think. The slight
air blowing lifted her bangs, not affecting her mind. &quot;Forgive me, wind. I
can&#39;t cease to fear the worst&quot;. Her deep aque mirror didn&#39;t tranquilize
her, the image still haunting her.

	     - Darien, we must go to the Hikawa dojo- anounced Serena as
she deactivated her communicating wristwatch- Amy and the others gave me
disturbing news.

	     -What happened?

	     - There&#39;s been an attack perpetrated by an unidentified
creature. They think it could strike again.

	     -I&#39;ll go with you- offered Setsuna- KaiOu-san, please don&#39;t
do anything rash and wait for my return.

	     - You need not to advise me that, dear friend. I&#39;ll be all
right.

	     They returned to the house, and Michiru was in Haruka&#39;s room
as she heard the car leave. Her mature self, &quot;so proper of a princess&quot;, as
Serena in a occasion said, usually lost a little in TeNou&#39;s presence: she
felt free to do anything, not minding if it was correct or not. &quot;The day I
forever linked my existence to yours, Haruka, was when I first saw you.
All changed, my violin now had a reason to sing more cheerfully, my
painting adquired more graceful colors. I never doubted I would eventually
get you; I never imagined, since then, the future without you. And when
you first saw me as Sailor Neptune in that strange day at the race track,
and I had to protect you from the monster, I knew that, as I revealed my
condition and my emotions, you would never leave me. Your arms held me,
and I&#39;ve never encountered a place so warm... Haruka...&quot;

	     -Haruka...- she whispered.

	     She marched toward her violin. The instrument layed
delicately on her bed, and in identical fashion she opened the case and
played. Stravinsky? Any of her Italian favorites? No, she simply sublimed
her sadness to the accords her heart was composing. 

	     Raye walked in with tea and cookies for everyone. Serena
inmediately received in her nostrils the mellow aroma and cheered.

	     - Wow, Raye! I have to admit you make good tea!

	     - Klutzy Serena, I won&#39;t serve you first. Every time I do,
you finish up all before anyone else can have a chance to touch their
share.

	     - Oh, well! I won&#39;t complain for now- Tsukino-san said in a
resignated tone.

	     -Why?!- Raye felt puzzled, but she didn&#39;t insist. The general
mood imposed a certain code of
no-corniness-and-stuff-because-it-doesn&#39;t-fit-the-scenario. Although, a
joke or two like Serena&#39;s faces as the tea was served soothed a little.
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t want everything dead serious either!&quot;.

	     Setsuna returned with Hotaru and Reeny from examining the
alley. Her expression was enough for Hino Raye to confirm her suspicions
of that morning. 

	     -You&#39;re right, Raye. The aura the creature left is identical
to the one in the alley. 

	     - I have the impression the enemy is powerful. It&#39;s not like
most energy-sucking monsters we&#39;ve fought. This one virtually can&#39;t give
itself as a winner if it doen&#39;t suck &#39;til death the chosen victim. Tonight
I&#39;ll consult the sacred fire of my ancestors for its identity.

	     MeiOu Setsuna whispered in private to Raye:

	     - Do you suppose this incident and Haruka&#39;s dissappearance
are related?

	     - I don&#39;t know why you ask that, Setsuna.- she answered as
she looked directly into her eyes-You also think the same, but I agree
it&#39;s not a good time to even speak of it. We must have more evidence to
sustain such a supposal. As soon as I get an answer from my ancestors&#39;
sacred fire I&#39;ll phone you.

	     -What are you two talking about?- interrupted Amy.

	     -Nothing, Mizuno-san, nothing- gestured Raye nervously.
&quot;Gods! Amy has such a sharp ear she could&#39;ve overheard the conversation&quot;.

	     -Hope you&#39;re not hiding something, Raye. Any information
could be useful, you know, and my computer still hasn&#39;t come up with
anything due to lack of data.

	     - Not to worry. I&#39;d tell you first if anything surfaces out.

	     That didn&#39;t make Amy feel easy. For now, however, she and the
others could only sit and wait, and that made them feel so impotent.

	    &quot;Ah! That was a good serve of energy! I must get all the
necessary so I can inhabit this body for good. Its power is excellent!
Only a few more and TeNou Haruka&#39;s spirit will permanently dissolve!&quot;. The
creature felt a little spasm, and clenched its teeth until it felt no more
of that pain. &quot;Go to hell, TeNou! You should thank me that I haven&#39;t
consumed your life energy, and instead I&#39;ve fed on others. I&#39;ll make it
clear: you&#39;re what I need, and I don&#39;t intend to leave you!&quot;

	      -Michiru!

	      Michiru again heard Haruka&#39;s plead for help. Without even
thinking, she hopped to the white Porsche over the garage and zoomed to
Tokio. &quot;I won&#39;t be as a while ago. I must tell the others!&quot;. She then
began speaking through the wristwatch.

	      The young man was very happy. About an hour ago he had
proposed to his girlfriend, and she whispered, half in musicality, half in
overjoy, him a splendid &#39;yes&#39;. The public lighting turned on, and the few
stars around were all he felt sufficient to decorate this special date. &quot;
I will always remember 7 p.m.&quot;, he pleasured himself.

	      As he walked ceremoniously, almost parading, down the street
he bumped into a stranger:

	      - I&#39;m sorry, sir, I was too caught up in... Sir?

	     The stranger didn&#39;t answer. Puzzled, the man noticed a blank,
souless stare.

	     - Sir? Is there something wrong?

	    The face of the stranger distorted into a mysterious smirk,
and grabbed the man by the neck, raising him in the air.

	     - You&#39;re a good catch, chum! Now, don&#39;t make this any more
painful for yourself! Just open up and say &#39;aaaa&#39;!

	     KaiOu Michiru saw the strong light in the direction her gut
lead her. She parked the car close by, and had ready in her hand her
transformation pen.   

	    -Neptune Crystal Power, make up!	   

	    At once she was the senshi of the sea, the elegant Sailor
Neptune, and rushed toward the place.  &quot;There&#39;s  an evil force acting
here, and Haruka&#39;s along with it!&quot;     

	    She then peeked through the shadows and saw a tall figure in a
black trench coat holding in the air another one, evidently taking out all
the energy of the latter.	

	    - Aaah!!- screamed the poor man.	   

	    -Just a little longer, and that&#39;ll be all I require, _kind
sir_- mocked the stranger.	

	    - Hold it right there, evil one! I won&#39;t allow you to take
this man&#39;s life!

	    The creature was displeased to being interrupted.

	     - And _who_ might you be, sweet darling?! Want a date? I&#39;m
already done, so I think I can attend you...  Should&#39;ve left things as
they were, &#39;cause you&#39;re next to feel my wrath!

	     The creature dropped the victim, and turned to face Neptune.
More than ready to throw her attack, she went inmediately to shock and
disbelief as she saw those familiar features. Not even the wicked shadow,
the paleness, the empty look and the raven-dark hair could fool her.

	     -It&#39;s not possible! It can&#39;t be! Haruka? Is it you?

	     As soon as it glanced towards Sailor Neptune, the creature
paralized, evidently awed. Haruka&#39;s blond hair returned, and she fell to
her knees aching terribly. 

	     -Michiru?- she murmured.-Michiru! Get away, fast!

	     Neptune rushed to her side. She would never forgive herself
if she didn&#39;t help her adored TeNou-san.	   

	     - Hold on, Haruka! Please resist!- she  coached her as she
brushed a little those blond bangs.-You must defeat this spirit!

	     Haruka took her hands to her head. The pain was coming back
stronger.

	    - Michiru, get out of here! I... can&#39;t... keep this...
thing... down... much... longer!  Aaaaaargh!

	    -I won&#39;t leave you, Te... 	   The hair again turned
dark, and the creature grasped Neptune&#39;s wrist.	     - Miss me?
You have a precious face - and energy, dear. I&#39;ll &quot;borrow&quot; it!	  
 - ...Nou-san! Nooooo!	    She began to weaken, she could feel
how the monster was taking her energy as voracious as a vulture.	  
   - Haruka! Don&#39;t let yourself get dominated! Harukaaaa!	       -
Venus Love Chain Encircle!		- Mercury Bubble Blast!	  
   At once the creature saw its wrist tightened by a chain, and the
visibility in the area got greatly reduced.		  -Blasted!- it
exclaimed as it had to let go of its prey to release its extremety and
float a safe distance from those inconvenient visitors.	      -
Stop right there, Haruka! Stop!	      -See you later, sweetheart!
	      Before she could get near it, the creature jumped to the
other side of the wall and vanished. Setsuna and Super Sailor Moon
approached her.	       - KaiOu-san, you now have an answer, and a
new challenge.	      - I know, Pluto. How will I rise up to it?
The creature almost drained me!	       Super Sailor Moon gave her
a supporting smile:		   - With a little help from your friends,
that is!		-Thank you, Super Sailor Moon. - Neptune said as
Mercury and Venus helped her to her feet- Please get back Haruka&#39;s soul!
	     - I promise you that, Michiru. I will.		  The fire
lit in a particular way Raye&#39;s figure, and reflected the same in her eyes
and her sweat. Being born with the gift of predicting events, she was
especially careful in using this ability, and only in emergencies she
dared employ it. &quot;You should charge for your predictions, and with the
money we can make improvements to the dojo and be in competition with the
best in the country&quot;, her grandfather insisted frequently. She typically
ended angry at his words, arguing that &quot;it isn&#39;t right to profit from such
a divine talent&quot;. She trusted much her mystic sensibility, and thanked the
gods for it.		    &quot;It carries a lot of responsability possessing
this privilege. Since I respect my part of the treaty, I expect the gods
to give me response.&quot; 	     Hino Raye then raised her head after
making the sacred signals. The flames flickered more intensely, and shaped
an image. No more was needed to perform, her question was granted a
response.		She was about to utter something when she heard
footsteps. She smiled. She could tell those steps anywhere.		 
- Did you stop the spirit?- she spurted	      - No...-said Serena
upset, wrinkling her forehead- To make matters worse, it has taken over
Haruka&#39;s body, and Sailor Neptune was attacked.	      - Is she
okay?- Raye inquired as she turned to speak with Mizuno Amy.		  
- Weak, but alive. Setsuna and Hotaru already put her in bed. 	  
 - I would reccomend them to keep an eye on her. This spirit, once it gets
a taste of energy, doesn&#39;t rest &#39;til it gets it. - pointed Amy.	  
   - You&#39;re saying it&#39;ll go again for Michiru?	     - Exactly,
Serena. Raye just told me what she saw in the flames, and it confirms the
data I obtained in the computer.	       - So we have to warn them!
	     - Don&#39;t jump to conclusions so soon, Serena. The creature
isn&#39;t that stupid to perform its plans so quickly. It&#39;ll wait for
opportunity to knock. 	    - That still doesn&#39;t give us a break-
Mina moaned- We have to keep vigilant of any possible attack. 	  
 - And we&#39;ll focus on that. Can your computer trace Haruka&#39;s signal?	  
	- Yes, Lita. Although she hasn&#39;t -and won&#39;t- use her Sailor
wristwatch, I managed to compare Michiru&#39;s with ours (since they&#39;re
different in some components), and arrange my machine to track her. Right
now she must be over... let me see... 	    - Where is she, Amy?
	    - At the  sports club! We must hurry there!	     
&quot;Well done, TeNou Haruka! Your memory serves me well to find a place for
ripe energy! Now, who will I choose for dinner?&quot;		Everybody
at the track stared at the odd man -as he was apparently-, wondering how
at night  could he use dark glasses. How would they ever suspect that
&quot;his&quot; eyes were piercing each and one of them, searching for the moment to
strike? &quot;He&quot; was perfectly conscious that &quot;his&quot; appearance was calling
attention; only that for the purposes that brought &quot;him&quot; here this was
more interesting. &quot;Lets just sit back and relax, Haruka. The rabbit shall
walk directly into the wolf&#39;s mouth&quot;. 	     The girls found it
hard to be admitted  in the exclusive place. Thanks to Amy, who was a
member, is that they made it inside. The interior was what you would
imagine from an Olympic village, and Mina, Lita and Serena were mighty
impressed.		  - It&#39;s like a dream! I&#39;d come here every day
minimun to see those gorgeous guys train!		 - I totally agree
with you, Mina. And I&#39;d also enter those judo lessons I saw offered.-
added Kino Lita.		- Gorgeous guys! And one of the best snack
bars in town, I heard!	      Raye bonked with her bag Serena&#39;s
head. 	     - Food! Is that all you can think, klutzy Serena?! Of
course, if I were here I&#39;d take those aerobic classes.	      -
Liar, liar! Pants on fire!-chanted Tsukino Serena- I noticed how you were
examining the brown haired guy lifting the barbells.		    - Shut
up, Serena! 		    - No I won&#39;t!		 - Girls, enough!-
silenced Amy- According to the computer, Haruka must be around the race
track. I advise that we transform before entering the area. And the spot
for that will be... The locker room!		    - Okay, time to go to
work! Moon Crisis...		    - Mercury Crystal Power... 	  
    - Mars Crystal Power...		   - Jupiter Crystal Power...   
	  - Venus Crystal Power...		  They said in unison
&#39;make up!&#39;, and after a few seconds the figures of Super Sailor Moon,
Sailor Mercury, Mars, Jupiter and Venus made presence. They inmediately
took each different paths to the race track, wanting to make sure to cover
every exit. &quot;This time we have to corner that thing, whatever it takes!&quot;.
When Super Sailor Moon made a promise, she guaranteed to keep it at all
cost. 	     By ten o&#39;clock the race track would be empty, except
for a woman that practiced her speed over and over. Her purpose was to be
number one in the 200 meters, and that was a good stimulation for her
exercises. It was about the thirteenth time she ran the distance, and,
thirsty, walked over to her sports bottle, next to her bag. She then
glanced to her right and noticed a shadow. She thought it was rude to have
her back turned to someone that probably needed help or wanted to meet
her, so she spinned over her heels to have the stranger face to face.
Before she could utter a hello, the stranger choked her neck and she felt
worse than dying.		 - What _are_ you?!		   - I&#39;m
your worst nightmare, chick!		    She still had enough energy to
kick the stranger in the stomach. The hit sort of made &quot;him&quot; loose
concentration, and let her go. She had to run as much as she could! She
was heading for the exit when she heard a perverse whisper:		 
- You can run but you can&#39;t hide from me!- The stranger had glided faster
than what she ran, and she thought it was the end for her.		-
I can not forgive anyone that tries to interrupt the dreams and of a
talented athlete! Better cut short your string of crimes, creature! Or, in
the name of the Moon, I shall punish you!		- Oh! It&#39;s _you_
people again! Said your prayers  tonight? You&#39;re gonna have it tough,
Sailor Scouts! Meet my HOWLING TWISTER!!	       At once a dark mass
of air, tornado-like, hit Super Sailor Moon, and the noise it made almost
turned everyone deaf. Sailor Mars couldn&#39;t stand the sight of her friend
getting hurt, and jumped out in front of the creature.	     - You
should greet people in a nicer way. Don&#39;t you think that&#39;s the reason _no_
one likes you?! Mars Celestial Fire Surround! 	    - It&#39;s that
the best you can do?- mocked the creature as it deflected Mars&#39; attack.-
You&#39;re gonna have to do homework, girl! Take a Howling Twister instead! 
	   - Aaaa!- screamed Mars in pain.		 Sailor Jupiter,
impacient, released her Jupiter Oak Revolution, while the creature was
busy with her colleague.	       She got lucky: the monster limped.
The leg got injured.		   - Sailor Jupiter! Don&#39;t kill that
thing!	     - Huh?!  	    - Are you forgetting that&#39;s
Haruka?	      - Damn, Mars! In that case we can only _wait_ for it
to wish to abandon the body when it wants?!		  - Not exactly.
Inside, there&#39;s Haruka&#39;s soul. We must insist her on expelling the
spirit.- explained Sailor Mercury as she analyzed the creature with her
visor.	     Super Sailor Moon recovered. She cut short the
monster&#39;s escape route and spoke:		- Haruka! Listen to me,
it&#39;s us, your friends! Haruka, please make an effort to expell the
monster!	       The hair of the creature was flashing from black to
blond and back. The eyes stared at Super Sailor Moon&#39;s.	       -
Dumpling-head! The spirit has gotten more powerful and... aaaargh!... is
planning to consume you all, starting with Michiru... Aaaaargh! I can&#39;t...
do it! You have to destroy me!	      - Haruka!	       The
spirit was back in control, and threw a Howling Twister at Super Sailor
Moon. 	     - Out of my way, kid! Gotta catch up with that
runner!	       - No! Venus Love Chain Encircle!	       -
That trick won&#39;t work again, blondie!- assured the monster as it got away
from the path of Venus&#39; attack.- Adios!	      -After that spirit!
We can&#39;t allow the girl to die!	      Everybody ran down the hall
and into the street to catch up with the spirit. On the way Mars
explained:		 - The creature is almost at its desired energy
level to fulfill its plans. Its waiting to lay hands on Michiru, but we
managed to make it loose a bit of its own.		 - That is not
what we should do either,- added Mercury- because then it will consume
Haruka&#39;s body and she&#39;ll die. 	    - So, what&#39;s the plan?-
inquired Moon.	     - Exclusively use our powers to block its
offensive weapons, or evade them. We have to make it waste its stored
energy enough to enable Haruka&#39;s soul to regain her body. Understood?   
	 -Yes!	     Setsuna and Hotaru served dinner to Michiru
in bed. She didn&#39;t seem to be interested in eating, and had her eyes fixed
in the door that communicated Haruka&#39;s room with hers. The older woman
guessed what was wrong with the other, and layed her hand in that of her
friend.	      - KaiOu-san, don&#39;t worry. Super Sailor Moon and the
rest are taking care of the situation. Even if you wanted to go you&#39;re not
fully recovered from the attack.	       Hotaru joined her plead to
Setsuna&#39;s:		 - Michiru-mama, you should eat so you can look
healthy and splendorous when Haruka-papa returns. Come on, now open your
mouth and receive the &quot;plane&quot;. Zoom!		   Michiru watched her
&quot;daughter&quot; lift the food with the fork and guide it in the air as a plane.
It was amusing, and she giggled. 		- Funny, little one! Okay,
control tower grants you permission to land!- and opened her mouth. She
chewed in her proper, exquisite manner.  She smiled back at them when she
finished her bite, for she was glad to have people that worried about her.
She ate well by herself after, and while Hotaru left to bring her a glass
of water, MeiOu and she had a talk.		   - I must confess,
Setsuna, that I am not at ease. I feel obligued to go and attempt getting
Haruka back!  	     - And you will do this whether we object or
not, that is your point, right?	       - Yes. 	      - I
hear determination speak through you, KaiOu-san. And I won&#39;t interfere in
your plans. I pressume you have knowledge that your life is in danger...
	     - Indeed I do, MeiOu- said Michiru as she got up and dressed-
I&#39;ll be carefull...		   - I hope you do.		   Setsuna
watched as Michiru left. Hotaru came with the glass in her hand.	  
     - Setsuna-mama, shall we assist them?		  - I trust
Destiny, my beautiful child, and things will happen as they are written.
	     Tomoe Hotaru left the glass on the table and hugged her. She
believed too in Destiny.		The creature glided into the
construction site. It knew itself followed, and couldn&#39;t afford to waste
its energy reserve. It then heard barks, it was the dogs encharged of
guarding the place. The creature was pleased to find them. &quot;They&#39;ll have
to do! I need strength to endure a battle and finish those Scouts!&quot;	  
	- Shut up and get here!- it called the dogs, and touched them for
a quarter of a second each- Nice puppies!		 -What the hell
happened here?!- rushed in the watchman.		- Sir, I warned
that your dogs are awfully noisy, and I came to make you see that no one&#39;s
above the law!	      - Can you tell me what freaking law is
that?- the man hardly articulated-! Aaaah!		  - The survival
of the fittest, that is!- it was sucking out the energy when it sensed
something,- I&#39;ll catch you later! Have a nice evening!- and dropped him.
	     It turned everywhere, and stood quietly for a minute.	  
       - Cut with the suspense, will you?! I _know_ you&#39;re here for me,
girls!	      Out from the left corner of the building stepped out
Super Sailor Moon and Sailor Mars. From the other angles of the area
appeared Mercury, Jupiter and Venus, ready to define the situation once
and for all.		   - You&#39;re so persistent, Sailor Scouts! You
leave no choice but to dig your graves right here!		 - Not so
fast, spirit! I will make sure you cause trouble no more!- stated Super
Sailor Moon.		   - You and what army?! I&#39; ll destroy you all!
Black Rain Acid Drops!	     - Carefull, everyone!- warned
Mercury- Take cover, that rain burns through most materials.  	  
 However, the creature angered at how a strange force blocked its
offensive weapon. Another blast poorly used! Who fired a planet-shaped
attack that had the color of the ocean it swam out from?	       -
Well, lucky me, being chased by beauties like you! But she!- and directed
its glare to the entrance- But she&#39;s the ultimate thing! And the one I&#39;ve
been raising hell for! Can I have your name, please? Or your phone?	  
       - Oh, you&#39;re a pathethic loser!- shouted Sailor Neptune as she
entered the scene- Whining for little old me! I&#39;m here and willing to
return the &quot;favors&quot;!		   - I just _love_ the way this woman
greets me! Don&#39;t be jealous, girls, if I toy with her for a while!- The
creature, before anyone could even breathe in or out, threw itself over
Neptune&#39;s body. She seemed to be waiting for that, Moon analyzed, because
she didn&#39;t try evade the capture. &quot;I wonder what she&#39;s trying to do&quot;.   
	 The others were puzzled. 		 - Oh! Ecstasic
experience! You&#39;re much richer than I expected! Ah! Just a little bit...
	    Neptune had her eyes all the time facing those of the spirit,
and clasped the opponent&#39;s wrist away from her with one hand to prevent
further absorbation.		   - Haruka, please! I know you&#39;re
watching, and wish no more to be at the mercy of this infernal thing! You
read my intentions, cooperate in the moment I tell you!	      The
monster had one of those spasms when Haruka recovered for seconds, and
sort of loosened the grip on the Sailor senshi.	       - Michiru,
there&#39;s no way! Kill me! It&#39;s the one path to get rid of this parasite! 
	    - No! I refuse that option, and you must have hope to take an
alternative! I&#39;ve never left you exposed to any risk, and I&#39;d rather die
than have you gone! Please listen to me, and fight, fight for your life!
Fight because you&#39;re TeNou Haruka, a strong, independent being, a person
on which many people count on, on which a soul has entrusted everything
precious, that can&#39;t dare to conceive the universe without you! Fight, for
God&#39;s sake! Fight!    	      - I&#39;m prepared to confront my
destiny, love- whispered Haruka, trying to hold back a waterfall of
tears.- Do it quick!		    It then came to Serena&#39;s mind what was
about to occur. She covered her mouth to prevent an inopportune gasp or
scream to escape, and, like her partners, watched.		  Neptune
had her deep aqua mirror directed at Haruka, noticed that the spirit was
about to regain control, and signaled TeNou:		    - Now, Haruka!
Submarine Reflection! 	     A large amount of water, originated
by the mirror, blasted through the body that the monster inhabited.
Hollerings of crude agony were heard throughout, and when the attack
concluded Sailor Neptune rushed to remove Haruka&#39;s body from any attempt
of the expelled spirit to recover its former possesion.	       -
You disgraceful rat! I&#39;ll show you to spoil my plans! 	     - I&#39;m
fed up with your bragging, worm-breath! Didn&#39;t you learn your lesson?-
yelled with renewed bravura the butch blond as she raised to confront him.
	       - Haruka, are you sure?	      - Yes, babe,-
assured TeNou-san- now give me my transformation pen. Uranus crystal
power! Make up!	       Completely taken by surprise, the creature
just stayed frozen as she transformed to her mighty alter ego, Sailor
Uranus, and didn&#39;t do much to combat any enemy offensive. 		 
	     - Attack all!- Venus urged- Venus Love &amp; Beauty Shock!	  
	- Lets rock &amp; roll, companion! World Shaking!- shouted Uranus.  
	   Neptune joined too the counterattack.		- Deep
Submerge!			       - Jupiter Oak Revolution!	  
     - Mars Flame Sniper!		 - Mercury Aqua Rhapsody!	  
      Super Sailor Moon viewed it was time for her cue. She was to set the
final strike with her kaleid moon scope.		- Moon Gorgeous
Meditation! 		    The end had come for this parasite. Without a
host, its powers were useless. The instant it left Haruka&#39;s body, it
sealed its destiny.		    - Aaaaaaaargh! Nooooooo!		  
  It yelled wildly, exhibiting its supernatural quality, even though it
reminded of its victims&#39; anguish as it disolved to nothing. 		  
 Uranus raised her fists in victory, but had to be holded by her partner.
It had been a consuming affair, it was perfectly reasonable for her to be
_extremely tired_.		   - I&#39;m so grateful to all of you,
friends. I appreciate that you never ceased to look after me. 	  
   Neptune had a tear or two running from her mediterranean blue eyes. She
held Uranus tightly by the waist.		  - Michi-chan, you can
lessen your hold. I&#39;m not going to fall, dear!	       - Silly!
I&#39;m not releasing you for anything!- she delivered in a poetic tone.	  
	  -I&#39;m glad this is over! Lets go home!- exhorted Serena. Their
job was done. 	      - Oh no!- said Lita- We still have a
birthday to celebrate!	       Haruka signaled a &#39;no&#39; with a nod.
	       - I think I had enough for a long time!	       -
TeNou-san! We all worked hard on your party! As soon as you recover we&#39;ll
go, right?		   &quot;She thinks I&#39;m gonna say &#39;yes&#39;?! Well, she
knows I can&#39;t refuse her!&quot;		   - Very well! In a couple of
days we shall be there!		The gang was pleased with this
answer, and all left for home. They definetely deserved a brake.	  
      EPILOGUE	       - Ready for the Spanish Embassy party,
Haruka? In an hour we have to be there!- urged KaiOu Michiru, dressed in a
lovely sky blue evening gown. 	      - I had finished fixing
myself a _long_ time ago, princess!- replied TeNou Haruka, reclining
against the stair rail.		Michiru examined her. 	  
    - You look flashy in that black tuxedo, but that bow tie... 	  
      - Fix it for me, please?- smirked Haruka in a sly fashion.	  
      She loved the delicassy that Michiru employed for the task. 	  
	- I am grateful, goddess- she entoned softly and kissed her hair-
I am not worthy of you.		- I might choke you for that!-
Michiru made as her hands would raise to Haruka&#39;s neck, but placed them in
the shoulders.- I&#39;ll be merciful with you tonight and save it for another
occassion. Set to go? 	      - Yes. I have one problem, though.
	      - What now, TeNou-san?		     - I heard the
Argentine representitive brought a special band for this party. An
orchestra specialized in playing tango.		- So? 	  
   - I don&#39;t know how the hell to dance that! 	      - Patience,
my loved one. We have about fifty-seven minutes left, that&#39;s enough to
teach you. Just let me guide you.		  - I always allow you to,
don&#39;t I?
	       It was true. Their mutual smile certified it, and nothing
like this comfort between them could any more please them.
