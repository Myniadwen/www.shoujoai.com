Juri knocked on the door, and Nabiki stuck her head out to look at her 
curiously. &quot;Can I have my office back for a bit?&quot; Juri asked her 
dryly.

Nabiki gave her a cool smile and nodded, &quot;Not a problem, boss.&quot; As she 
walked by her she gave Shiori a withering look, before heading down 
the stairs to help out with opening up the Locket for the day&#39;s 
business.

Shiori frowned at Juri, saying accusingly, &quot;I guess she&#39;s heard all 
about us.&quot;

Juri looked at her calmly as she answered, &quot;Not from me.&quot;

Shiori nodded, feeling a bit abashed. &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; she admitted 
softly. A little smile, &quot;You always were the perfect gentleman.&quot;

&quot;Grab a seat,&quot; Juri invited her, letting Shiori sit first. After 
Shiori grabbed the couch, Juri sat down in the desk chair.

&quot;I don&#39;t bite,&quot; Shiori said with a little smile.

Juri didn&#39;t respond to that quip. &quot;Are you still doing the fencing?&quot; 
she asked Shiori softly.

&quot;No,&quot; Shiori answered, shaking her head a bit regretfully, &quot;it was 
never really my thing. I just got into it to be close to you.&quot;

Juri looked a bit startled. &quot;I didn&#39;t know that,&quot; she said softly.



Keiko looked more than a bit alarmed. &quot;Shiori&#39;s up there?&quot; she asked 
Nabiki shrilly. The other woman nodded coolly. &quot;And you left them 
alone! One of us should be up there,&quot; she said, looking honestly 
concerned for Juri.

&quot;I&#39;m sure that Arisugawa can take care of herself,&quot; Nabiki said, 
trying to sound as confident as she possibly could.

&quot;Not around Shiori, she can&#39;t,&quot; Keiko sighed.

Keiko found herself remembering some of the wilder stories about 
Shiori and Juri that had been circling around Ohtori way back when. 
She was about to head up the stairs to try and rescue Juri when a 
gentle hand on her arm stopped her.

May lifted her hand and smiled over at her sunnily, &quot;I really think 
Juri needs to deal with this on her own.&quot; She added softly, &quot;If she 
doesn&#39;t, she will always feel that Shiori has some kind of hold on 
her.&quot;

Keiko sighed softly. &quot;I guess your right,&quot; she quietly admitted.

&quot;And if she does hurt Juri somehow,&quot; Minagi said as she calmly wiped 
down the top of the bar, &quot;we&#39;ll all just hunt her down and kill her.&quot; 
Ryouko nodded her agreement.

May sighed this time, &quot;That might be just a bit extreme.&quot;

&quot;Not to me,&quot; Ryouko said, sounding deadly serious. Hyatt and Excel 
both gravely nodded their agreement, before Hyatt flopped over.



Shiori suddenly sneezed for no apparent reason. She sniffled slightly, 
rubbing at her nose as discretely as she could manage.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Juri asked her curiously.

&quot;I guess someone must be talking about me,&quot; Shiori chuckled softly. 
She noticed the bottles in the office&#39;s mini-bar, and got up to 
prepare some drinks.

Shiori pulled down one fancy looking bottle, and with a soft chuckle 
Juri said &quot;Don&#39;t pour that unless you just want ginger-ale.&quot; At 
Shiori&#39;s questioning gaze, she explained, &quot;I don&#39;t drink on the job. 
If I have to drink, I just have something non-alcoholic.&quot;

&quot;I learn something new about you everyday,&quot; Shiori said softly. She 
poured herself a whisky, then sat down on the couch again. There was a 
thin band of white on her finger, where her ring had been the last 
time.

&quot;Here&#39;s something new for you to learn,&quot; Juri said softly, leaning 
forward to look into Shiori&#39;s eyes. &quot;I was in love with you, back in 
school,&quot; she said softly.

Shiori&#39;s eyes were wide with startlement, but not really surprised. &quot;I 
don&#39;t remember you being this frank,&quot; she said softly, with a little 
smile. Juri just shrugged, looking over at Shiori calmly. &quot;I knew,&quot; 
Shiori finally admitted, &quot;or I figured it out, eventually.&quot;

&quot;Then why,&quot; Juri asked with a bit of honest anger in her voice, &quot;did 
you treat me the way you did? You ran away from me, Shiori, more than 
once.&quot;

A flush marked Shiori&#39;s cheeks. &quot;I&#39;m not running from you now,&quot; she 
said softly. She took a drink, &quot;I know I made some mistakes, Juri, but 
I&#39;d like to make it up to you if I can.&quot;

Juri digested that statement, wondering just what she meant by it. 
&quot;Are you married?&quot; she asked her, out of the blue. Shiori looked a bit 
startled at that so she said, &quot;I can see where the ring was, Shiori.&quot;

Shiori rubbed at her finger gently, where the ring had marked her. 
&quot;Divorced, actually,&quot; she said softly. She looked up, her eyes dark 
with sorrow, &quot;I don&#39;t like to think about what I put the poor man 
through. I was never happy, and I took it out on him.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Juri said awkwardly.

Juri got out of her chair and nervously sat down by Shiori on the 
office&#39;s small couch, comfortingly patting her on the shoulder. Shiori 
smiled up at her gratefully, and it took Juri a great deal of effort 
to fight the old impulse to pull her close.

&quot;It&#39;s not your fault,&quot; Shiori sighed. &quot;I wanted to prove to myself 
that I was straight,&quot; she said ruefully, &quot;and that poor fool was the 
one I picked to do it.&quot; She looked up at Juri, &quot;I was very attracted 
to you back then, too, but it scared me to death. It was so much 
stronger than anything I had felt with a boy, before.&quot;

&quot;So you ran from me,&quot; Juri said softly, understanding some of the 
things Shiori had done back then. She looked searchingly into Shiori&#39;s 
eyes, trying to see her intentions. &quot;What do you want from me, 
Shiori?&quot; she asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;m not asking you to turn back the clock,&quot; Shiori said softly. &quot;But 
I could use a friend right about now,&quot; she smiled a bit, &quot;and if that 
old fire comes back, fine. But if it doesn&#39;t, I think that would be 
fine too.&quot;

&quot;Friends,&quot; Juri echoed, and she realized that was all that Shiori was 
to her now. She was attractive, yes, but no more than dozens of other 
girls that came into the locket every day. With a more relaxed smile 
Juri said, &quot;That sounds like a good idea.&quot;

They left the office together, and Juri fought a smile. She pointed 
out discretely the crowd gathered at the bottom of the stairs, trying 
to hear what was going on upstairs. Shiori muffled a laugh, &quot;You have 
loyal friends, Juri.&quot;

&quot;I like to think so,&quot; Juri answered, her smile including Shiori in 
that group. The two of them reached the top of the stairs and she saw 
the group of the scatter. They made their way down and saw all of them 
back on the job, pretending they hadn&#39;t been listening in at all.

The first few customers started to come in, and Juri excused herself 
to get to work. Shiori gently took her arm, and with a smile said, 
&quot;Thank you, Juri.&quot;

&quot;Anytime,&quot; Juri answered.
