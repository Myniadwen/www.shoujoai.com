<p align="center"><strong>Epilogue</strong></p>
<p align="center">-Two Weeks after Concert  Night-</p>
<p>“You see anyone?”</p>
<p>“Well it's pretty  early...”</p>
<p>“The coast seems clear,  right?”</p>
<p>“What are you, paranoid?  That's supposed to be my job.”</p>
<p>Minako paused, looking over  at her companion. Then, smiling, she leaned over and gave Rei a sound  kiss, which instantly silenced the woman with a medium flush. It  wasn't so much the act that embarrassed her, but all the things that  had happened up to this point, especially in the last fortnight, that  every gesture of affection from the long-time idol now reminded her  of.</p>
<p>Minako, used to this,  laughed and squeezed Rei's hand for a moment before moving to get out  of the car. “I suppose you're right- we don't have a whole lot to  be conservative about now, do we? Though the privacy idea <em>is</em> nice...”</p>
<p>Rei  snorted, getting out of the car. “Even if we <em>are</em> seen, we  might just end up giving her more business.”</p>
<p>Minako  nudged Rei playfully as they walked together towards the quiet little  store, jewelry sparkling in the early morning light. “Play nice,  Rei-chan”</p>
<p>Rei only  rolled her eyes, not saying anything, absently opening the door for  Minako. It was kind of fun, mimicking how a guy <em>should</em> be, Rei  had realized, all the while enjoying the benefits of being female.</p>
<p>The  telltale bell rang their presence, summoning someone from the back  room.</p>
<p>It  wasn't who they were hoping for though.</p>
<p>Rinka  smiled as she walked over to them, or rather, the singers had moved  to the counter by the time she had come up behind it. “Good  morning, you two. I trust you've been well?”</p>
<p>Unconsciously,  the two young women glanced at each other, a shy smile that whispered  of more on both sets of lips. “Very,” they answered in unison.</p>
<p>Rinka's  smiled changed to a more knowing one, as if she had expected as such.  “Are you here to see Eika, or were you looking for more companion  pieces to the rings? If I may add, I had no say in the selection of  them whatsoever, but I do think they look nice on you.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled back. “Thank you. I think so too. But, um, yes, we were hear  to see Eika... is she around?”</p>
<p>Rinka  closed her eyes for a moments, adjusting herself so that she was more  comfortably seated. “I'm sorry, but Eika is out on business for a  while yet. I'm not actually sure when she'll be back. I can pass on a  message if you like though. I'm sure she's also sorry that she can't  be here when you two are obviously taking the time out of busy  schedules to visit...”</p>
<p>Perhaps  only Rei noticed, but as the lapidary's hands drifted over the edge  of the counter, Rinka pressed a small button.</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head. Eika had been strange enough- there was no point in  asking for her partner to explain likely yet another quirk. “We  aren't that busy. I made sure of that. Well...” Rei coughed. “Sort  of.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled reminiscing. “Ah... that was a <em>long</em> night, figuring  out our basic plans together... it'll be a while before we can  completely assimilate into it though.”</p>
<p>Rinka  had stood up to fetch tea, though she inquired pleasantly, keeping to  herself that she doubted plan-making was what really made it a long  night, “And what are those plans, if you don't mind my asking?”</p>
<p>Minako  sighed. “I'm switching my main audience, I guess you could say.  Instead of targeting the able-bodied people who can afford to go out  and buy my CDs or attend my concerts, I'll be going to them, visiting  hospitals, day cares, senior centers, that sort of thing.”</p>
<p>Rei  added, “And I'll be going with her, doing prayers and a little  fortune-telling censored for the true good things rather than blatant  lies... We'll be staying in the area still though until I find  someone who I know can properly take care of the shrine. But then  we'll go around Japan- with far less guards and superiority  atmosphere, and maybe, every year, go someplace different for a  special concert...”</p>
<p>At this  point Rei stopped and looked down, the blush returning.</p>
<p>Minako  continued, “Since the concert was on Rei's birthday, and our most  important anniversary, it'll be an annual tribute to it. I, of  course, intend to fully take Rei-chan's singing under my wing and  practice singing with her. Karaoke style instead of studio.”</p>
<p>Rinka  blinked in surprise, partially in wonderment that the idol had  decided to downgrade the fluff of her luxurious life so quickly.  Maybe it really <em>had </em>been a long night of going back and  forth... “Karaoke you say?”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded, mumbling, “It's cheaper.”</p>
<p>Minako  leaned over for a momentary hug, “And our Rei-chan needs a <em>lot</em> of practice just to see how much <em>fun</em> singing is. What better  way than an informal Karaoke place?”</p>
<p>Rinka  smiled softly, amused at the casual air of their relationship after  only two weeks of being together. <em>They must have worked fast... or  maybe they saw each other as a couple subconsciously and didn't need  much to work it into their daily attitude.</em> She brought the tea  tray over, complete with sugar packs and stirring sticks. As Rei and  Minako accepted their cups, each adding their own amount of sugar or  lack thereof to their portion, Rinka asked, “Your fans really don't  mind? I haven't been able to watch the news too often, but I hear you  have had a lot of press conferences and interviews and the like?”</p>
<p>Rei  answered, “They, err, admire um... us, I guess, even more... just  for a slightly different, um... reason.” She scratched her cheek,  which was only slightly pink. “They um, keep saying things like  being... um... romantic inspiration, I guess...”</p>
<p>Minako  nodded. “It's not too bad, the ones who oppose though. We made it  clear that if we were to 'poison the minds of the innocent fans' we  would only do so in a love-conquers-all way. And  being-proud-of-your-love. I'm used to the workload of covering  something momentous, but at least, this time, it's a good thing  despite being personal. And it <em>definitely</em> pulls over better  with Rei next to me.”</p>
<p>Rinka  nodded understandingly. Some of the customers she'd had since then  had mentioned something about that- so it was making a productive  difference now. Beginning to, at least. “Rei-san... how did your  father take it?”</p>
<p>Rei half  scoffed, half snorted at it. “I had two meetings with him. One  before all the other press dealings with Minako, and one just the  other day alone. He objected at first, both to my liking another  woman and to being a singer and to be involved <em>with</em> a  singer... and he tried to dissuade us, but he knew no one would  believe them if they tried to announce it was all fake- because it  wasn't. The second time... he'd seen the effect we'd had on the  fans... even the non-fans... and well... he told me that he wouldn't  say anything against it as long as we took care of each other. Which,  we, of course, intend to.”</p>
<p>Rei  paused, and then laughed. “It just so happens that before the  concert, my father had sent me yet another present, a bit earlier  than usual for my birthday, and it had been- I didn't open it until  after Minako realized it was there- a really... really good quality  silk wrap, two actually. One deep red, and one gold. I asked just in  case, and he said he wouldn't be bothered if I gave the matching gold  one to Minako so that... well... yeah...”</p>
<p>Minako  purred, after having taken a sip from her tea, “It was received  well when we wore them to a dinner party last week. Though I think it  may have been a bit more due to the dress Rei wore that night...”</p>
<p>Rei's  blush completely returned as she clarified, “<em>You</em> made me  wear it! If I'd known... I would've objected sooner.”</p>
<p>Minako  pouted, like she had that night. “You didn't like it?”</p>
<p>Rei  snorted. “That has nothing to do with it.” In a mumble, “I  would have preferred that others didn't like it so much... I almost  thought I'd never get to actually spend time with you, what with all  of them in the way all the time.”</p>
<p>At  Minako's giggle, Rei flushed deeper into herself. The last two weeks  had been full of such embarrassing admissions, in retribution for all  the years before when they had both held it in. Thus, Minako felt Rei  needed to be rewarded for her effort and gave her a neat peck on the  cheek.</p>
<p>Which,  of course, kept that blush on longer.</p>
<p>Rinka  chuckled inwardly. “Ah, was there anything in particular you wanted  to tell Eika?”</p>
<p>Remembering  that that had been the original idea, Minako started. “Well, we  both kind of wanted to thank her. We told each other what had been  Eika's doing as opposed to our own, and well, she didn't actively do  a whole lot. I've only really talked to Eika on the phone, but I have  been since before I arrived in Japan. I wanted to find something nice  to give to Rei on her birthday, and somewhere along the way she  called me on my love for her... and from there, we kept up a regular  acquaintance, and I'd update her on what happened...”</p>
<p>Minako  sighed. “I was really dubious when she said that no matter what  happened, I couldn't <em>do</em> anything until she gave me a sign  based on her observations that Rei was ready for it... she never said  it, or implied that it was a sure thing, but there was something  about the way she talked, as if she was so certain that everything  would work out the way I wanted... I don't know how she did it, but  the more I talked to her, the more I <em>wanted</em> to do something,  and the more I wanted it, the more she pressed that I couldn't do  anything. It was... Wednesday I think? I really didn't like having to  turn Rei away, but I happened to be talking to Eika at the time  and... well... yeah.”</p>
<p>Rinka  couldn't help but smile and shake her head, sipping peacefully from  her cup. She only ever caught glimpses of Eika's work until the end,  but like clockwork, she got to hear it like this every time. This  time, she had manipulated a reversal of their attraction-action  emotions, doggedly showing Rei how to be more forward, all whilst  pressing on Minako to restrain herself until Rei could handle it, all  the while building up pressure inside her. In essence, it was like  trying to force Rei up the long ladder, but have her go the rest of  the way in jumping off the diving board, into the waters down below  where Minako was waiting, like a shark, highly anticipating but  restrained to her pool.</p>
<p>Horrible  in a way, and yet effective.</p>
<p>Especially  if they both secretly wanted it.</p>
<p>Taking a  casual sip from her cup, Rinka murmured, “I see... Well, I'm glad  that you don't have to worry about that anymore.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded, albeit limply. It was obvious without her saying that taking  down her barriers had gushed forth more than she had originally  imagined. Twas taxing, surely. Satisfying, but taxing.</p>
<p>Minako  added out of the blue, after a pleasantly small silence, “I'm glad  that Mako-chan and Ami-chan have found their happiness together too.  They said we were their own inspiration, but I think they had a bit  of a head start on us.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded in a simple agreement. “What did they say it was? A job in  Holland?”</p>
<p>Minako  nodded in affirmation. “Ami-chan is a doctor friend of ours, and  when one of her medical school associates called her telling her that  he had recommended her to a friend of his in Holland who was looking  for able staff members for his new hospital... she accepted. But not  before she learned that Mako-chan had an offer there and used that to  ask if she wanted to leave at the same time, conserving money (not  that Ami <em>really</em> needs to, but out of force of habit) by living  in an apartment complex together there.”</p>
<p>Rinka  slowly frowned. She had heard snippets here and there of those two  but... “Isn't this... Mako-chan married? Or did I hear wrong?”</p>
<p>Rei  shook her head. “They'll still be married under law. But Mako-chan  decided to train Motoki's recently discovered lover and friend to  take care of the shop with him, and she'd start a new branch shop in  Holland, and see where that took her. They're still on good terms  though.”</p>
<p>Rinka  paused, enough to hesitantly verify, “And these two... Mako and  Ami... have they confessed to loving each other?”</p>
<p>Minako  nodded. “Mako-chan did it first, before she found out about Motoki,  but Ami-chan did it after, the same day she told Mako-chan about  Holland. They're still nervous, but they'll see where their  relationship goes from here.”</p>
<p>Rinka  nodded understandingly. “So I take it they are also happy with  their arrangement?”</p>
<p>Rei and  Minako looked at each other, and then looked back. “Yes, I'd say  so.”</p>
<p>Rinked  clasped her hands together. “That's good then, definitely good. So,  you two, when's the wedding?”</p>
<p>This  time, Minako joined Rei in her blushing.</p>
<p>Minako  murmured, head slightly bent, “Um... We haven't... decided yet...”</p>
<p>“Soon though,” Rinka  prompted.</p>
<p>Rei took  a deep breath and answered, “We'll know when we're ready, whether  it's sooner or later. And if you could, we'd really like it if you  and Eika could attend...”</p>
<p>Rinka  smiled. “I'll see what we can do. Thank you for the invite.”</p>
<p>Minako  shook her head. “If it weren't for this place, and Eika being the  way she is, I don't know if either of us would have had the nerve to  take the chance of being rejected.”</p>
<p>Rei  suddenly remembered something, but she hesitated to share it. Then,  figuring that Rinka already knew, she asked, “Once, Eika told me  she had someone she loved for a long time, and she confessed then,  but... she gave me the impression that... um... it didn't work out.  Is... is Eika... Is she really happy, these days?”</p>
<p>Rinka  was almost literally floored by Rei's statement. In all the time that  she had known Eika, which was quite a while, she had never heard of  such a thing. But she knew the answer to the latter. Not that she  would say so. “She's always happy to know that her good deed of the  moment is done and a couple finds love as a result. She's fine.”</p>
<p>Rei  hesitated again. “You... do <em>you</em> know who she loves? She  said... she said 'they disapprove of my hobby quite a bit, but not in  the way you think'. Do you... know anything about that?”</p>
<p>Rinka  paused now. Minako waited patiently, seeming curious about this as  well. <em>Could it be...?</em></p>
<p>A small  smile crossed her lips. “To be honest, she never told me about it,  and I've never noticed. I'm sure she's gotten over it by now if it  was unrequited though, she's good at that. So you don't have to worry  about her.”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded limply. She didn't quite believe it, but she didn't object to  it either. She couldn't. Eika, for all her advances and talk, still  seemed like a stranger to her.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  Minako's cell phone beeped.</p>
<p>And then  started to trill.</p>
<p>Minako  quickly fetched it and snapped it open. A moment's talk and a groan  later, she looked over at her companions. “Rei-chan... they're  calling us back...”</p>
<p>Rei also  seemed worn for worse. “Again? Where now?”</p>
<p>“Um... to the office. To  sign papers.”</p>
<p>Rei  sighed. “I signed papers yesterday! And the day before that! And a  whole bunch of them before <em>that</em>. What could these <em>possibly</em> be for?”</p>
<p>Minako  giggled, standing up. “Practicing your autograph. Come on; it'll  only get worse if we try to delay it. It was nice talking to you,  Rinka-san.”</p>
<p>Rinka  shook her head. “The pleasure is mine, I assure you. Don't work  yourself out too much, you hear?”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded, standing, and bowed in agreement. “Don't worry, we won't.  And we'll advertise some for you too.”</p>
<p>Rinka  smiled. “Thank you. But do feel free to drop in yourselves if you  ever have time.”</p>
<p>Minako  smiled back. “We will. Take care! And make sure to tell Eika, thank  you, for us.”</p>
<p>Rinka  waved as the pair reached the door. “I'll be sure to.”</p>
<p>And with  that, the duo left.</p>
<p>Rinka  sighed, flipping the switch off again with a last whisper, “That's  another one for the Wall, isn't it Eika? Congratulations.”</p>
<p>-.-.-  Several hours later, aka that night...-.-.-</p>
<p>Rinka  made her way up the apartment steps, not particularly caring to be  quiet or disruptive. Slipping her key into the appropriate slot, she  slipped into hers and Eika's apartment.</p>
<p>As she  expected, the light was off.</p>
<p>She  closed the door behind her, using the moon's light to guide her  change of footwear, entering the living room, knowing without a  second's thought what she would find.</p>
<p>Sure  enough, she was there, lying on the sofa, eyes open and vacant, the  blanket tucked around her body marginally hiding the small, ragged,  stuffed bear.</p>
<p>The one  Rinka had given her after Eika's parents had passed away.</p>
<p>Rinka  sighed, weaving around the small mountains of videos and DVDs, all  some form of great romance stories of any time, ignoring the blank  blue screen of the TV, skipping past the remains of half eaten  instant food, and cleared a space for herself in front of the sofa.</p>
<p>Sitting down, she started  her night's work, taking a clean tissue and wiping the stray food  particles from marring Eika's otherwise unmarked, jaded face.</p>
<p>The life didn't come back  into those eyes, but Rinka knew that her heart was still beating. So  she simply talked, to herself, and yet to Eika as well.</p>
<p>“You took it especially  hard this time, didn't you? You've never seen anyone as dedicated as  them, even after you paired them up. I know you were watching today.  They really are happy. And they want you to be happy too.”</p>
<p>Eika didn't respond.</p>
<p>“You know, I always  wondered why you became so depressed after every project was  completed. You know you have visitors, especially right after,  because you never fail. But you never see them. Why? I wondered why  you couldn't stand to see others happy, even though you worked to  make them so.”</p>
<p>Eika's body went a little  rigid, and when Rinka had turned to retrieve something nearby, she  closed her eyes. Hugging the bear closer to her.</p>
<p>“But then,” Rinka  continued, “Rei came along, and told me and interesting piece of  information, which I'm sure you caught today. She said you love  someone, but it's unrequited. I never know who you fall in love with,  you know, because you're always flirting with someone- especially  customers.”</p>
<p>As Rinka lightly combed  through Eika's hair with her fingers, eventually pushing the strands  away from her face, Rinka murmured, “You know... I do recall  telling you that I didn't like you doing this to yourself. Being  honest with your own feelings wouldn't hurt. And if you found someone  you loved... When Rei said that last part, and I thought about it, I  started to realize what it was. Eika... you haven't been holding back  because I'm an old friend, are you?”</p>
<p>The teddy bear went up to  cover Eika's mouth.</p>
<p>Rinka smiled softly. She  then bent forward, whispering into the woman's ear, “You don't have  to be afraid. I will always support your feelings as a part of you.  And, Eika, I want you to know... Aishiteru (I love you).”</p>
<p>The eyes snapped open, the  surprise evident.</p>
<p>Rinka leaned back a little  to see, and smiled at the innocent sight.</p>
<p>It came out like a croak at  first, as if Eika hadn't used her voice in too long. But after  clearing her throat, she was able to distinctly whisper, “Really?  Do you mean that?”</p>
<p>Rinka let their noses touch.  “When have I ever lied to you? And when have I ever really not  given you a place to return to?”</p>
<p>Eika looked down, mumbling  like a chastised child, “Never...”</p>
<p>Rinka smiled. “Do you love  me?”</p>
<p>Eika nodded her eyes on her  bear.</p>
<p>“Enough to say it?”</p>
<p>Eika hesitated. Then,  finally, she whispered, the smallest of blushes tinging her cheeks,  “Ai...shiteru.”</p>
<p>Rinka broke into another  smile. “Good girl.”</p>
<p>With that, Rinka let her  lips touch Eika's.</p>
