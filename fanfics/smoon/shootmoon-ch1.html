<h1>Shooting for the Moon (part 1 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/nutzoide.html">Nutzoide</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     Story notes: This is *not* the start of the story! I recommend 
that you read the prologue (Chapter 0) first, as it both links this 
story with the first one, Fallen Stars, and sets up this new story 
properly.

***
			 Back to Normal? 
               Settling In is Hard to Do.
    
    
    Mizuno Katsura had, in truth, already long lost hope that her 
daughter would ever return home again. She could tell herself 
whatever she wanted, and she could write all the notes in the world, 
and every night she would come home to the same empty apartment, 
knowing full well that the note would still be lying there unread. 
She was a modern, practical and realistic woman.
    
    So practical that her medical work had always come before her 
family. Her husband had left them because she was so inflexible, and 
her daughter had never come to her when she had needed help. Ami&#39;s 
books had always been so much more reliable than a mother who wasn&#39;t 
there. But Katsura had always worked her hardest to further her 
career; healing as many people as she could, showing that a woman 
could be successful in Japan back when that was still so unusual, and 
earning the money that kept her and her daughter from wanting 
anything.
    
    But what good was it now? All the jewellery in the world would 
not bring her daughter back to her. If Ami had run away, it was 
precisely because - deep inside - she had hated living like that. And 
if the newspapers and her gossiping neighbours were right, if her 
daughter had been caught in one of the Sailor Senshi&#39;s battles... 
    
    But Katsura indulged her meagre and irrational hopes. It was a 
mother&#39;s privilege, she told herself, to believe that her child was 
somewhere safe, and that one day she might come back home.
    
    Every day the walk back up the stairs of the condominium to their 
apartment seemed to get a few steps longer, but any thoughts like 
that ended up being pushed to the back of her mind. For over a month 
now she had forced herself to stay occupied and think of other 
things, throwing everything she had behind her work at the hospital. 
She worked the extra late shifts and took on extra patients, if only 
to give herself something that would fill what little free time she 
had. She felt the worried stares of her co-workers on her back every 
day, either wondering when she might cave in or hoping that she would 
go easier on herself. But then, she loved her work. It kept her 
going, and reassured her that she was still needed somewhere now that 
home felt so empty.
    
     But this time home was not empty. Katsura&#39;s key refused to turn 
in the lock. The middle aged doctor suddenly felt her fingers 
trembling as her nightly routine ground to a halt. Reaching out, 
almost scared of what she was doing, she took the doorknob in her 
hand and twisted. It turned freely, and the door swung open. Her eyes 
no longer felt so prickly and fatigued behind her glasses as she 
scanned the entrance hall.
    
    Ami&#39;s shoes sat neatly by the step, and a large tied bag sat by 
the hall cupboard. Katsura could barely bring herself to believe it 
as a euphoric sense of relief exploded inside her, bringing tears of 
the utmost joy to her eyes. &quot;Ami!&quot;
    
    She let her handbag fall as she dashed to her daughter&#39;s room and 
there, her cheeks stained with tears as she slept, was Ami. It was 
all Katsura could do to stop herself from hauling her daughter into 
her arms, but she forced herself to settle for just kneeling by her 
child&#39;s bed and taking one of Ami&#39;s hands in her own.
    
    &quot;Thank God,&quot; Katsura whispered as the tears poured down her 
cheeks. She couldn&#39;t even begin to think what her daughter had been 
through these last months, but the sight of Ami&#39;s own tearstained 
face was more worry than she could cope with right then. 
    
    Still, as careful as she had been, Ami&#39;s sleep had not been 
heavy, and the touch of her mother&#39;s hands was enough to stir her 
from her restless dreams. &quot;Huh..?&quot; she murmured as the world came 
back into focus, wondering where she was and why the ground was so 
soft.
    
    Then she saw her mother&#39;s face hovering over her, and it all came 
flooding back. &quot;M-mother...&quot;
    
    Katsura smiled through her freely flowing tears and clutched her 
daughter to her as Ami began to sob as well. 
    
    &quot;Where have you been?&quot; Katsura said, &quot;Why couldn&#39;t you at least 
call me?&quot;
    
    Ami just shook her head as she cried into her mother&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I&#39;m sorry Mother!&quot;
    
    That only confused Katsura further, but what anger she felt at 
Ami&#39;s disappearance was replaced with concern for her wellbeing as 
the girl broke down in her arms. &quot;Ami, please tell me what happened. 
Are you alright?&quot;
    
    Ami sniffed and nodded, feeling herself smile in spite of her 
guilt. &quot;I&#39;m okay. I&#39;m good Mother. I&#39;m so sorry. I didn&#39;t run away. I 
never wanted to leave.&quot;
    
    Katsura nodded, and she was beaming as she pulled her daughter 
away from her. &quot;I&#39;m glad. Are... are the other girls safe as well?&quot;
    
    Ami nodded again, and wiped at her eyes. &quot;Yes. We&#39;re all okay 
now. It&#39;s over.&quot;
    
    Katsura let out a sigh of relief at hearing that. If Ami thought 
it was over then whatever happened wouldn&#39;t be happening again. And 
it was good that Ami&#39;s friends were safe. They had been a godsend in 
being there for her, and Katsura liked them, even if they were rather 
frivolous. She knew that the ones who had been spared her daughter&#39;s 
fate had suffered greatly when Ami and the other girls had vanished.
    
    &quot;Ami,&quot; she pushed gently, not wanting to go too far when Ami had 
only just come back to her, &quot;can you tell me what happened to you?&quot;
    
    Ami hesitated, and that worried her. Ami was a terrible liar, but 
she couldn&#39;t really blame her for wanting to avoid saying things now. 
For as much as Katsura cared about her, especially since Ami&#39;s father 
had left, the two of them had never been a close family. As long as 
she understood that whatever it was, Ami could tell her about it, 
then Katsura would be satisfied. She had not spent nearly as much 
time with her daughter as she knew she should have, but she did know 
that Ami was trustworthy.
    
    For her part Ami wanted nothing more that to pour out her soul. 
To lay down everything she had done and everything that had happened, 
and then she could live with the consequences, knowing that her 
conscience was clear. But that would mean telling her mother 
*everything*. About the years she had spent lying in order to be 
Sailor Mercury, so that she could put herself in harm&#39;s way, even if 
it was for a good cause. And, if her mother knew the truth about 
Sailor Mercury, it would put them both in danger. If that happened 
her mother could be used against them if their next enemy ever found 
out.
    
    &quot;There was a battle,&quot; Ami finally said. &quot;The Sailor Senshi were 
fighting this bird woman, and we couldn&#39;t get out of the way in time 
when she attacked us. The Sailor Senshi saved us, but the attack... I 
know it sounds crazy, but it sent us to a different place. Another 
dimension I think. We have spent all this time trying to get back.&quot;
    
    It was a simple half truth, but one that would satisfy, and one 
that they had all agreed on back in Seiji. The less they had to make 
up the better, and hopefully people wouldn&#39;t ask too many questions.
    
    &quot;I never wanted to make you think those things,&quot; she finished, 
giving her mother the crumpled note and feeling herself tear up again 
as she began to cry out the last of her pent up energy. &quot;I love you 
Mother.&quot;
    
    Katsura smiled and drew her in again for another, more comforting 
hug. &quot;I know Ami. I love you too. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re home. And when you 
want to talk, I&#39;ll listen this time. I promise.&quot;

***
    
    Naturally, it was only a matter of time before Usagi well and 
truly ambushed her wayward friends. Not only had they caused her so 
much grief for disappearing like that, but they had the cheek to come 
back with stories of a great fantasy adventure that she had missed 
out on. It was enough to infuriate her!
    
    Or rather, it would have been if she had not been so giddy at the 
thought of finally seeing them all again. She giggled to herself, and 
it was only the fact that her arm was wrapped around her fiance&#39;s 
that stopped her from breaking into a run. She had actually been 
getting used to the idea that her best friends were gone, and then 
Makoto had phoned her out of the blue. And in the middle of the night 
too! She had almost fainted from the shock! Well, it might have been 
tiredness, but she was pretty sure it was shock.
    
    Of course, she hadn&#39;t been able to sleep a wink from then on, as 
the bags under Mamoru&#39;s eyes could testify to. Still, he was as glad 
as Usagi that their companions had somehow managed to return. It was 
worth it just to have Usagi so excited once again, but that wasn&#39;t 
the only reason. His was a different peer group altogether, but they 
were good girls and he liked their company a great deal.
    
    So it was that he was the first to start running to the Crown 
fruit parlour, and Usagi let her meagre self restraint go to the 
wind, laughing giddily all the way. She couldn&#39;t remember the last 
time she had felt like that. At least not since Mamoru had finally 
proposed properly to her, and her father had, reluctantly, allowed 
her to move in with him.
    
    The Tsukino patriarch had been hoping that actually living 
together would show them both just how hard it would be for a couple 
like them, but both Mamoru and Usagi had adapted to it with gusto, 
even if it was not always easy. With the promise of wedding bells 
some time in the near future and having her closest friends returned 
to her... As soon as it had all sunk in Usagi had found herself 
firmly seated on cloud nine, and Mamoru was happy to be carried along 
for the ride.
    
    With the pair of them laughing as they ran arm in arm down the 
street, Usagi&#39;s blonde dumpling-tails streaming out behind her, they 
were not a hard target for the others to spot as they loitered 
outside the Crown, their old meeting place. In fact, as they all 
waved and shouted their greetings the four of them began to worry 
that Usagi would end up running them all down like a blue eyed 
bowling ball. Thankfully for them Usagi had already run out of puff 
by the time she got to them, the practice she still got from running 
to college obviously not having helped her stamina.
    
    &quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; they all said as Usagi, sucked in almighty breath.
    
    &quot;Everyone!&quot; And, being Usagi, that moment couldn&#39;t last without 
her throwing herself at them and bawling her eyes out! They were just 
simple, happy tears and not the childish fountains of her junior high 
years, but Rei rolled her eyes all the same as her friend cried into 
her clothing.
    
    &quot;For goodness sake Usagi-chan!&quot; Rei exclaimed, even as she 
returned the embrace. &quot;You&#39;re making a scene.&quot;
    
    &quot;Meanie,&quot; Usagi retorted, before letting her go. &quot;I don&#39;t care. I 
missed you.&quot;
    
    Rei nodded and let go as Usagi went to mob the others. &quot;We missed 
you too dumpling-head.&quot;
    
    As Usagi and Minako crushed each other, looking for all the world 
like long lost twins as they rejoiced in synch, Mamoru and Ami smiled 
at each other before sharing a hug of their own.
    
    &quot;I&#39;m glad you made it back okay,&quot; he said with a smile.
    
    Ami nodded as they broke apart, feeling very glad to be home. 
&quot;Thank you for taking care of her, Mamoru-kun.&quot;
    
    Makoto followed Ami&#39;s lead and wrapped her arms around him. &quot;Heh 
heh, yeah, I bet she put you through hell because of this.&quot;
    
    Mamoru just shrugged, happy not to think about it now. &quot;Something 
like that.&quot;
    
    Once no-one had been left out Usagi took both Mamoru and Minako&#39;s 
hands and dragged them up the short flight of stairs and into the 
Crown&#39;s fruit parlour. &quot;Now you have to tell me everything! What was 
the food like there? Did they have any cute boys?&quot;
    
    Behind them Rei, Ami and Makoto laughed as Mamoru sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m 
right here Usagi. And I have to get to work soon.&quot;
    
    &quot;Aww,&quot; Usagi pouted as she pushed him into the booth, &quot;Just one 
drink? Don&#39;t you want to hear everything?&quot;
    
    Mamoru sighed. &quot;Of course I&#39;m interested, but I have work, and if 
you&#39;re going to be serious then Luna and Artemis should hear this 
too, shouldn&#39;t they?&quot;
    
    In return Usagi grinned and put her bag on the table. &quot;Hee hee, I 
thought of that.&quot; Then, as she flipped open the top, two rather 
seasick looking felines poked their heads out, very glad for the 
fresh air.
    
    &quot;I thought I was going to die...&quot; Artemis whispered while Luna 
just tried very hard to compose herself.
    
    &quot;Luna!&quot; &quot;Artemis!&quot;
    
    &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all safe,&quot; Luna whispered to them, making very 
sure that no-one noticed the fact that two cats in a handbag had just 
been deposited on a restaurant table.
    
    &quot;Meow!&quot; Artemis agreed, already into his housecat act, borne of 
long experience of being draped over Minako&#39;s shoulder in public.
    
    &quot;I missed you Artemis!&quot; Minako beamed, eagerly petting him. &quot;And 
Daddy tells me you moved in with Luna while I was away, how naughty!&quot;
    
    The pair of them flushed brightly, which was quite a feat under 
all their fur. &quot;Wha..!!&quot; Luna exclaimed, before she remembered where 
she was and settled for giving Minako an indignant &#39;It wasn&#39;t like 
that!&#39; look.
    
    &quot;So come on, come on,&quot; Usagi wheedled. &quot;I want to hear 
everything!&quot;
    
    Of course, she had not let Makoto off lightly the night before 
and already had some idea of what had happened to them all. Still, 
hearing it from them all properly, even if it was the &#39;cover version&#39; 
as Makoto had called it, would be far better than a midnight phone 
call.
    
    &quot;Everything, hmm?&quot; Minako grinned, giving the two girls on her 
right a crafty, slanted look. &quot;Everything like... a little love 
affair?&quot;
    
    Usagi&#39;s jaw dropped, and Makoto could have sworn that the girl&#39;s 
eyes were bulging a little more than was healthy. &quot;Umm, I was hoping 
to be a bit more tactful that than Mina-chan...&quot;
    
    &quot;You&#39;re kidding!&quot; Usagi cried, feigning a sniff. &quot;And I wasn&#39;t 
there to sneak out all the juicy information?&quot;
    
    Minako nodded in sympathy that was far too theatrical to be in 
the least bit honest. &quot;That&#39;s what I said. Mmm-hmm.&quot;
    
    &quot;But you *were* there!&quot; Usagi sighed before the energy returned 
to her eyes. Eyes which latched firmly onto Makoto. &quot;So come on, who 
is he?&quot; Then she actually thought about it for a moment. &quot;Or... who 
was he? Did you have to break up when you came home? Oh Mako-chan, to 
have such a tragic relationship!&quot;
    
    &quot;Oi, oi,&quot; Rei said, her un-amused gaze just as deadpan as her 
voice. &quot;I&#39;m right here you know.&quot;
    
    That stopped Usagi&#39;s wistful theatrics dead, and her eyes darted 
back and forth between the two of them. Makoto sighed, practically 
able to see the question marks pop into existence over Usagi&#39;s head. 
&quot;Rei, I didn&#39;t actually tell her about that last night.&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh?&quot; She was surprised that it hadn&#39;t been one of the first 
things Makoto would have told Usagi. Then again, Makoto had been 
somewhat reluctant to tell the others back in Seiji as well. She just 
shrugged and smiled happily, leaning into Makoto&#39;s arm. &quot;Well, there 
you have it.&quot;
    
    &quot;Well,&quot; Mamoru said, rather bemused as Makoto blushed quietly to 
herself, &quot;that&#39;s a turn up for the books. You never said you were... 
both ways inclined Rei-chan.&quot;
    
    &quot;Woooow,&quot; Usagi boggled. &quot;All that time with Haruka-san; her cool 
style must be catching!&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh don&#39;t be so stupid!&quot; Rei replied, nipping that idea in the 
bud. &quot;I just never thought about it before.&quot;
    
    &#39;Not much anyway,&#39; she added to herself. But, while Usagi might 
have missed it, her silly observation had caused Ami&#39;s smile to slip 
slightly as she looked at her menu.
    
    &quot;Anyway,&quot; Rei added, smartly changing the subject, &quot;it was hard 
for me in that place, and Makoto was very good to me.&quot;
    
    &quot;So casually...&quot; Usagi said, noticing the way Rei said her name. 
&quot;You&#39;re not kidding, are you?&quot;
    
    The two of them just shook their heads, and Rei leaned up to give 
Makoto a quick peck, just to prove it.
    
    Usagi grinned at the way Makoto blushed. It was just too sweet. 
&quot;So how did she tell you?&quot; Usagi asked, eager for the gossip. &quot;What 
was your first date like?&quot;
    
    &quot;Actually,&quot; Rei said, jumping the gun before Makoto could answer. 
She had to set the story straight after all. &quot;It was Mako who told 
me.&quot;
    
    &quot;Wha- really? What part of her is like your sempai then?&quot; Usagi 
asked, not altogether joking. That had always been a driving force in 
Makoto&#39;s crushes after all.
    
    For her part Makoto chuckled and gave a shrug. &quot;I&#39;m still trying 
to work that out! It just sort of happened.&quot; Her voice softened as 
she admitted it. &quot;It scared me actually. I mean, it&#39;s not exactly 
normal.&quot;
    
    &quot;But it still happened,&quot; Ami spoke up, defending Makoto from 
herself. &quot;And you still told her, so it all worked out for the best, 
right?&quot;
    
    Makoto sighed, a smile firmly fixed on her face as she took Rei&#39;s 
hand in her own beneath the table. &quot;Yeah. It did. Definitely for the 
best.&quot;
    
    &quot;And the date?&quot; Usagi pushed.
    
    Both Makoto and Rei opened their mouths, but blinked as they 
didn&#39;t actually find the answer. &quot;You know,&quot; Makoto finally said, &quot;I 
don&#39;t think we&#39;ve actually had a proper date yet.&quot;
    
    Rei nodded. &quot;Well, that day at the tower didn&#39;t really count I 
guess, thanks to Desir.&quot;
    
    Usagi looked both riveted and confused in equal measure. Which 
was to say: a great deal of both. &quot;Desir? What&#39;s that? You haven&#39;t 
even dated yet? How does that work?&quot;
    
    Makoto smiled sheepishly. &quot;Well, it was all rather complicated, 
and like I said, it was kind of weird for both of us.&quot;
    
    Rei nodded with a mock-serious air. &quot;Uh-huh. She decided she was 
suddenly in love with someone she&#39;d known for years, and I was trying 
hard not to got nuts at the same time as I was realising I liked it.&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh, and we were overthrowing a kingdom at the same time, don&#39;t 
forget that,&quot; Minako added.
    
    Ami nodded. &quot;And we were learning how to use dangerous magic. And 
trying not to get caught by soldiers all the time.&quot;
    
    &quot;Getting arrested...&quot; Makoto added to the list, her eyes drifting 
upward as she tried to pull together all the relevant bullet points. 
&quot;becoming outlaws...&quot;
    
    Mamoru had to laugh. &quot;And I thought *our* courtship was awkward!&quot; 
he said, giving Usagi an amused look. &quot;Having to deal with your 
father doesn&#39;t seem quite so bad after hearing about that.&quot;
    
    Usagi swatted at his arm playfully. &quot;Don&#39;t be mean. He&#39;ll come 
around eventually.&quot;
    
    &quot;Exactly,&quot; Minako said with her trademark enthusiasm. &quot;He let you 
get engaged after all. That&#39;s half the wedding won!&quot;
    
    Then, spotting the waitress as she emerged from the kitchens, 
this time not loaded down with orders, Usagi gave her a call. 
&quot;Unazuki-san! Over here!&quot;
    
    &quot;Ah, everyone, you&#39;re back!&quot; Unazuki said as she got to them. In 
the years since they had first started coming to the Crown Unazuki 
had grown into a good looking young lady who filled out her uniform 
very well. As such it was no wonder that she still worked there; she 
got great tips. No doubt she and her brother would properly take over 
the business from their parents soon. &quot;I saw it on the news. I 
thought I&#39;d lost my good customers! What happened to you all?&quot;
    
    &quot;That&#39;s a long story,&quot; Ami replied with a tired smile, wondering 
just how many times the five of them were going to have to tell it.
    
    Thankfully though their long time supplier of ice cream parfaits 
was all too willing to settle for that and gave them all a smile. 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure the newspapers will keep me up to date when 
they catch you! So, just this one time I&#39;ll give you my &#39;long time 
customer welcome back special discount&#39;!&quot;
    
    &quot;Which you just made up,&quot; Rei said with a grin.
    
    &quot;Of course,&quot; Unazuki replied with a wink. &quot;Even before you left 
you haven&#39;t been coming as often as you used to. I need to keep 
Usagi-chan here!&quot;
    
    Mamoru feigned a grieving look, making sure that Usagi noticed. 
&quot;Alas, poor wallet, I knew him well.&quot;
    
    The effect was somewhat lost on his betrothed since he actually 
quoted the line in English, but she got the gist of it from the way 
Rei, Ami and Minako laughed. For her part Makoto, whose English was 
even worse than Usagi&#39;s these days, just leaned across the table to 
commiserate with her. At least she could stand up for her friend in 
such times of strife. 
    
    &quot;Usagi-chan, be strong. Such foreign words can only be met with 
ice cream retaliation.&quot;
    
    &quot;Yes,&quot; Usagi nodded, taking Makoto&#39;s hand as if she was a long 
surviving war-buddy. &quot;Just for that, I have no choice.&quot; She smiled up 
at Unazuki. &quot;One double fudge parfait with extra cherries please. Two 
spoons.&quot;
    
    Mamoru really did give a sigh for his wallet this time. That 
particular confection was in the Crown&#39;s top bracket of ice creams. 
&quot;Um, Furuhata-san, how much is that discount?&quot;
    
    Unazuki grinned and chose to play along with Usagi, her eyes 
wandering up as she mused on the question. &quot;Hmm, how much indeed. It 
can&#39;t be too much, and yet Usagi-chan is such a good customer...&quot; 
Then she giggled and let the man off the hook. &quot;For you, twenty five 
percent. Just don&#39;t tell anyone. I have an image to keep up.&quot;
    
    It was only as Unazuki headed back to the kitchen that Makoto 
realised Usagi was still holding her hand across the table. &quot;Usagi-
chan? I&#39;m going to need that back some day, you know?&quot; Then she saw 
the tears that were once again forming in her friend&#39;s eyes. &quot;Usagi-
chan...&quot;
    
    &quot;I&#39;ve missed you guys,&quot; Usagi sniffed, burying her head against 
Makoto&#39;s hand. &quot;You were gone for so long, I didn&#39;t think you were 
ever coming back.&quot; 
    
    The rest of them could hardly stay dry eyed at that either. It 
had been such a long time since they could just play around together. 
&quot;There there, Usagi-chan, it&#39;s the same for us too,&quot; Makoto soothed 
as her hand was held, and beside her Rei huffed with false annoyance 
as she tried to force back those infectious, burgeoning tears.
    
    &quot;Stop it already, dumpling-head. People are staring at us.&quot; 
    
    Not that any of them actually cared. Having their own little 
group back together again was all that mattered. Mamoru had only just 
managed to get her presentable again by the time their orders came, 
but Unazuki was still worried enough to ask what was wrong.
    
    &quot;Nothing,&quot; Usagi replied with a huge, damp-cheeked smile, and she 
stuck a spoonful of her sickly sweet ice cream in her mouth. &quot;It&#39;s 
good!&quot;
    
    &quot;It&#39;s always good!&quot; Unazuki smiled back before leaving them to 
it.
    
    As they started in on their sweets Mamoru cast an eye over Ami as 
she nursed her simple drink. She was usually the quietest of them 
unless it came to their studies, but she had still been 
uncharacteristically withdrawn while the others had gushed over each 
other.
    
    &quot;Are you alright Ami-chan? You seem...&quot; He found himself 
searching for the appropriate word, but one that wouldn&#39;t put her on 
the spot. She was, after all, easily embarrassed, but whatever it was 
had obviously played on her mind. &quot;You seem tired.&quot;
    
    Ami looked over in surprise before giving him a grateful smile. 
&quot;Thank you Mamoru-kun. I&#39;m okay. It is just... dimensional jet-lag. I 
didn&#39;t sleep very well when I got back.&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh?&quot; said Makoto suddenly concerned. She was suffering from the 
same thing after her late night call with Usagi, but she didn&#39;t 
really feel that bad from it. At least not yet. &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she 
asked, before realising that one of the possible answers wasn&#39;t 
something that they should talk about. &quot;Is... your Mother okay? You 
could go home, couldn&#39;t you?&quot;
    
    Ami nodded, thankful for all the concern they were showing. &quot;Yes, 
it was all fine. But she came home very late, and we cried a lot. I 
really made a lot of trouble for her.&quot;
    
    Minako nodded in sympathy. &quot;Same here. Mama was furious that I&#39;d 
been gone for so long. It was a good thing that I called to tell her 
beforehand, and she had cooled off by the time I actually got home. 
Mostly anyway. Daddy may be useless, but he can talk to her when 
she&#39;s like that.&quot;
    
    &quot;And it&#39;s not like you did it on purpose,&quot; Makoto added. &quot;Mizuno-
sensei would understand.&quot;
    
    And it was true. Her mother had been very understanding. &quot;Yes. It 
was silly, but we both just needed to have a proper cry! What about 
you Mako-chan? Was your apartment okay?&quot;
    
    Rei looked up at her girlfriend, feeling slightly guilty that the 
question had not already come from her. She hadn&#39;t even considered 
that Makoto might have had a problem with that.
    
    &quot;Yeah, it was all okay,&quot; Makoto replied. &quot;I still have to dust 
like crazy, but they haven&#39;t cut off my utilities or anything. I also 
checked with the noodle shop, and Matsubashi-san is willing to take 
me back as well. He was so convinced I&#39;d come back he didn&#39;t even get 
a replacement for me! It was amazing!&quot;
    
    &quot;That&#39;s great Mako-chan,&quot; Usagi exclaimed. &quot;What about school? 
They&#39;ll let you go back, right?&quot;
    
    That one caused her to stumble a little. &quot;Uhh, I haven&#39;t actually 
checked with them yet. I was... going to do that this afternoon. I 
haven&#39;t had time, because I slept kinda late!&quot;
    
    &quot;I&#39;m sure you will be fine Mako-chan,&quot; Rei assured her, but 
inside she was determined to find out just why Makoto had been caught 
short by that. It had been impossible to miss. Makoto was second only 
to Ami in being unable to lie convincingly, and it was a close second 
at that. &quot;Mind you, I bet Ami-chan already has a list of all the 
things she had to cram. There isn&#39;t much time left!&quot;
    
    All eyes fell on Ami then as the girl turned bright red. &quot;Th-that 
isn&#39;t true Rei-chan. I just... don&#39;t want to be...&quot; 
    
    It was futile, and she knew it. &quot;Yes. I did,&quot; she said, trying to 
make herself as small as possible before she combusted under their 
gaze.
    
    &quot;Timetables and everything?&quot; Minako added with a cheeky grin.
    
    Ami gave an almost imperceptible nod.
    
    &quot;Hee hee, it&#39;s okay Ami-chan,&quot; Usagi said, patting her on the 
shoulder. &quot;At least you won&#39;t have to do re-takes or anything.&quot;
    
    &quot;Which reminds me,&quot; Mamoru interrupted, filling Usagi with fear, 
&quot;if you have time Ami-chan, could you organise a few cram session 
with Usagi?&quot;
    
    &quot;I didn&#39;t skip that many classes,&quot; Usagi said, suddenly feeling 
blue. &quot;I was grieving.&quot;
    
    &quot;But we still want you to pass your exams too,&quot; Mamoru said, 
stroking her cheek affectionately. &quot;And now everyone&#39;s back. You 
crammed amazingly well to get into college, it would be a shame to 
break that winning streak now.&quot;
    
    Ami nodded in agreement. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do Mamoru-kun, 
Usagi-chan.&quot;
    
    &quot;You&#39;ll be there too right Rei-chan? Mako-chan?&quot; Usagi all but 
pleaded, her ice cream spoon in her mouth. &quot;Just like old times, all 
cramming together?&quot;
    
    Again Makoto shifted uncomfortably at the mention of it, but Rei 
nodded. &quot;Sure. I don&#39;t know how much I&#39;ve missed, but with my luck 
it&#39;ll be too much!&quot;
    
    It was then that Makoto, glancing out of the window, realised 
just how much attention their rather conspicuous reunion had 
gathered. &quot;Umm, guys, you know we always have a window booth? That 
might not be such a good idea next time.&quot;
    
    The others all followed her gaze to see that, as Makoto had said, 
they had actually gathered a small crowd. Not only that, there was a 
man who looked suspiciously like a reporter making his way towards 
them with &#39;front page news&#39; practically written across his forehead.
    
    &quot;Uh oh,&quot; Rei said, &quot;maybe we aught to go.&quot;
    
    &quot;How can all these people care about us having ice cream?&quot; Makoto 
asked.
    
    &quot;Your disappearance did make the national news,&quot; Mamoru replied 
seriously. &quot;Sailor Senshi related casualties do that.&quot;
    
    Even though they were attracting the least number of stares Usagi 
was quick to hide the cats under the table. &quot;Sorry Luna. Aww, this 
isn&#39;t fair, I haven&#39;t finished my parfait.&quot;
    
    Minako on the other hand had a gleam in her eyes. &quot;Wait. Don&#39;t 
you get it? This is a big scoop. A *big* scoop! Leave it to me.&quot;
    
    When the reporter got into the restaurant he barely had the 
chance to introduce himself and ask whether they were the missing 
girls before Minako got to work.
    
    &quot;Yes, that&#39;s us. And I bet you&#39;re just dying to hear about that, 
first reporter on the scene and all.&quot;
    
    The man just smiled broadly. &quot;If you would be so kind.&quot;
    
    &quot;Well,&quot; Minako beamed back, &quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll have to talk to my 
agent. We have to do this properly after all.&quot;
    
    The reporter looked at her, lost for words, before his smile 
returned, if a little brokenly. &quot;Could you at least say whether the 
missing Sailor Senshi have returned as well? Did they rescue you?&quot;
    
    Minako gave him a cunning grin. &quot;That&#39;s why we have to do this 
properly, wouldn&#39;t you agree?&quot;
    
    The reporter sighed and nodded. She knew what she was doing, and 
she had no doubt advised her friends to stay quiet as well. &quot;Very 
well Aino-san. I will let you choose the time, place, and terms, and 
my magazine won&#39;t hassle your friends either. In return, just 
remember my name,&quot; he said, passing her his card. If the direct 
approach didn&#39;t work, maybe good will would get him his exclusive. 
Simply being able to report their return would be news enough for 
now.
    
    Minako tucked the card into her purse without even looking at it 
and gave him a wave as he left. &quot;How good of you. Take care now.&quot;
    
    Mamoru watched him go, more than a little wary about what his 
appearance signified. &quot;It looks like you are going to attract a fair 
bit of attention, for now at least.&quot;
    
    &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Minako dismissed, getting out her phone. 
&quot;Just don&#39;t talk to them and leave everything to me. We might even 
get some nice spending money out of this.&quot;
    
    While the others weren&#39;t nearly has happy with the idea of 
talking to the press - they never had done in the past, no matter how 
much those people wanted to talk to the Sailor Senshi - they all 
liked the idea of getting a little something for their troubles, 
though for very different reasons.
    
    &quot;Mikiyo-san, it&#39;s Minako... Aww, I didn&#39;t know you cared about 
the smallest name on your list. Yes, I&#39;m okay, I got back last 
night... I know, I should have called you, but it was gone midnight! 
... Yes, that&#39;s the reason I&#39;m calling, can you handle something for 
us?&quot;

***
    
    It had taken a little time, but the six of them had finally made 
their escape, leaving just their parfait glasses and a small crowd of 
inquisitive passers by in their wake. They should have expected it 
really, but the attention had felt very strange, even for Minako. It 
wasn&#39;t even like they had done anything worthy of the attention this 
time, at least not in Japan. Ami had likened it to being a goldfish 
in a bowl.
    
    Mamoru finally said his farewells as he headed off to work, 
probably having to apologise for being so late when he got there, but 
Usagi wasn&#39;t about to let her friends off so easily. She had spent 
the morning making something for them, and wanted to play hostess and 
talk until they lost their voices.
    
    It was a surprise when Rei begged off but, after much cajoling, 
she had been clear. There was time for fun later. She still had 
things to sort out, and living at the shrine meant that she started 
work as soon as she was ready.
    
    It was the perfect excuse for Makoto. &quot;Maybe I should go with 
you, I guess I&#39;ve still got too much to do too. And someone needs to 
make sure you don&#39;t work too hard.&quot;
    
    Usagi and Minako had wanted to argue, but they both caught a sly 
gleam in their eyes. That was a much better idea. Rei and Makoto, 
making excuses to leave together? Though the blonde pair made a drama 
out of it they finally acquiesced, and let the two of them go with a 
wink while they and Ami, smiling diplomatically, headed for Usagi and 
Mamoru&#39;s flat.
    
    Rei sighed as she and Makoto walked in the opposite direction. 
&quot;Thanks for the help,&quot; Rei said, giving Makoto a knowing look as they 
made for Rei&#39;s college, &quot;but you know they&#39;re going to be thinking 
all sorts of things now.&quot;
    
    Makoto smiled guiltily, &quot;Well, Ami-chan can keep them under 
control. I just didn&#39;t get a chance to talk to you before. How did it 
go, with Grandpa and everything?&quot;
    
    Rei realised what Makoto meant, and smiled to herself. Makoto had 
been worrying about that? That fuzzy feeling in her chest returned 
and she took Makoto&#39;s hand as they walked, suddenly far less 
concerned about how it would look. &quot;He didn&#39;t say much of anything 
really. I don&#39;t even know if he understood any of it, but he said as 
long as I had done my best, then that was good enough. I could tell 
he hated the idea of me...&quot; 
    
    Her hold on Makoto&#39;s hand tightened a little, &quot;... doing what I 
did to those soldiers, but he didn&#39;t say anything.&quot; She found herself 
smiling through the painful and guilt-laced memories. &quot;It&#39;s weird. 
He&#39;s always so stupid and irresponsible, but he&#39;s really great when 
it matters. If he hadn&#39;t been like that I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d have 
done.&quot;
    
    &quot;You&#39;d have come to me, I hope,&quot; Makoto said, looking hopeful as 
she sounded.
    
    Rei didn&#39;t understand why her feelings had grown for Makoto, but 
that look was part of it. That hopeful look was both confident and 
vulnerable at the same time, and didn&#39;t fail to bring a smile to her 
face. &quot;Hee hee, maybe I would.&quot; 
    
    Makoto nodded, glad that Rei was in higher spirits. 
    
    &quot;So, what do you have to do? I hope you don&#39;t want me to help 
dust that apartment of yours,&quot; Rei said with a wink. Then an idea 
struck her. One that would answer two questions in one go. &quot;Actually, 
why don&#39;t we go to your college first? It&#39;s not that far from here is 
it? We can catch the bus to mine later.&quot;
    
    &quot;Actually,&quot; Makoto replied, sounding nervous, &quot;I was thinking, 
maybe we could have a proper date. One that doesn&#39;t involve demons. 
Something... normal.&quot;
    
    &quot;Makoto... I think I&#39;d like that,&quot; Rei said, caught a little off 
guard and feeling the sudden urge to hug her. Up until now Rei had 
been the one to instigate things between them, aside from Makoto&#39;s 
original confession. In fact, Makoto had been down right cautious 
about making any moves. 
    
    However, while the idea made her heart skip a beat, it hadn&#39;t 
escaped her notice that Makoto had avoided her question, and the 
sudden awkwardness she felt in the way Makoto held her hand wasn&#39;t 
just from asking if Rei wanted to go out with her. 
    
    &quot;But you know,&quot; Rei added, not wanting to scare her girlfriend 
off with her questions, &quot;I really do have things to sort out, 
otherwise I would have gone with Usagi-chan. I don&#39;t mind taking a 
detour with you though. It&#39;s better to get school out of the way 
first, right?&quot;
    
    She gave Makoto&#39;s hand a comforting squeeze. &quot;And a girl needs 
time to get ready for a date after all!&quot;
    
    Makoto did smile at that, but it was only a wan tweak of the 
lips. &quot;I&#39;m a girl too you know.&quot;
    
    Rei realised her blunder too late. &quot;No, Mako, I didn&#39;t mean it 
like that. Never mind me, I&#39;m just saying stupid things. Come on, 
let&#39;s get you sorted out for college and we can talk properly...&quot;
    
    &quot;Rei don&#39;t,&quot; Makoto interrupted, not moving an inch as Rei had 
started to walk on. Makoto let go of her hand, and Rei found herself 
worrying about what was wrong. Makoto so rarely let things get to her 
like this.
    
    &quot;What is it? You avoided Usagi-chan&#39;s question at the Crown too.  
What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
    
    Makoto just stood there, feeling awkward and unsightly as she 
stared at the ground. &quot;I already went. I didn&#39;t sleep late. I haven&#39;t 
been to bed yet. Usagi-chan and me talked so late I thought it would 
be better if I just stayed up and got used to Japan time again.&quot;
    
    &quot;So... what happened?&quot; Rei asked, reaching out to take Makoto&#39;s 
hand again and stroking it with her thumb as she held it.
    
    Makoto smiled at the gesture, but it didn&#39;t stop her feeling like 
dirt, especially for lying to her friends, and to the beautiful young 
woman who was trying to help her. &quot;Before we ended up in Seiji I was 
going to try and meet up with Ami-chan again, so she could tutor me. 
I was in big trouble Rei, I&#39;m just no good as a student. I figured 
that if Ami-chan could help me like she used to, I&#39;d be okay.
    
    &quot;Then we all ended up in Seiji, and I&#39;ve missed two months. I 
can&#39;t catch up now. Not in three weeks. My tutors say it&#39;s best if I 
re-take the year.&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh Makoto,&quot; Rei said, wishing Makoto had told them. Of course it 
was obvious why she hadn&#39;t. Makoto had always been proud of living 
alone, of being able to get on without her parents, and only minimal 
support from the authorities. &quot;It&#39;s not that bad. You&#39;ll have a head 
start next year. You&#39;ll be able to ace it then even without Ami-
chan&#39;s...&quot;
    
    Makoto didn&#39;t let her finish, and she scrunched her eyes shut as 
she finally admitted the worst of it. &quot;I can&#39;t afford it!&quot;
    
    Hearing Rei gasp was painful, it made her feel ashamed that she 
had let this happen, but Rei deserved to hear it. Makoto wouldn&#39;t 
allow herself to be comforted until Rei saw how much of a fool the 
real Makoto had been underneath her bravado. &quot;I don&#39;t have enough 
money to re-take the year. I can only pay all the bills I&#39;ve got 
because Matsubashi-san is going to let this go as my paid holiday for 
the year.&quot;
    
    &quot;But what about your final year? You couldn&#39;t pay for it?&quot; Rei 
asked, aghast.
    
     Makoto found a hiccough in her throat. &quot;My savings were going to 
pay for it, but I can&#39;t make enough money to take an extra year and 
still pay for everything else. It&#39;s because I had to work that I 
couldn&#39;t study enough. Matsubashi-san even let me take my books when 
we had a slow day, and it still wasn&#39;t enough.&quot;
    
    &quot;Makoto,&quot; Rei whispered, before taking Makoto into her arms and 
holding her closely. &quot;Pay for it. We&#39;ll find a way to deal with the 
extra fees. Ami-chan&#39;s mother is rich, and so are Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san, maybe if we ask them...&quot;
    
    Makoto shook her head. &quot;I can&#39;t do that. It&#39;s not their problem. 
It&#39;s better to live with your mistakes, right? I shouldn&#39;t have 
bought such a big wardrobe, especially since nothing ever fits me 
anyway.&quot; 
    
    It wasn&#39;t as if Makoto could avoid noticing the looks they were 
drawing. To see someone like her being held and reassured by a girl a 
full head smaller...
    
    &quot;Be quiet!&quot; Rei admonished. &quot;So what if you have good fashion 
sense? You deserve better than this Mako. You were so excited about 
getting into that school, I won&#39;t let you throw it away just because 
you&#39;re too proud to ask for help. We&#39;re your friends, we&#39;re supposed 
to be there for each other. I don&#39;t want you to feel like this!&quot;
    
    And Rei kissed her. Neither of them could avoid noticing the 
looks *that* drew, but she didn&#39;t care. She would suffer them for 
Makoto&#39;s sake, and when Makoto pulled away, she let her. Makoto, who 
could be so worried about what people thought and so worried about 
being in love with her, despite being such a strong person.
    
    &quot;Come on, school can wait until this afternoon,&quot; Rei said, 
confidently taking Makoto&#39;s hand again and trying to dispel the 
girl&#39;s worries. &quot;Let&#39;s clean out that apartment of yours!&quot;
    
    And to her relief it actually seemed to work. Though she could 
have done with a moment to clean herself up again, Makoto&#39;s grip on 
her hand had regained that gentle, protective feeling that Rei was 
coming to know as Makoto&#39;s alone. 

*** 
    
    A single beam of sunlight shone in through the crack in the 
curtains, casting its brilliant yellow presence across the pale 
celadon bed sheets. After hours slowly creeping across the room its 
bright edges finally alighted on Haruka&#39;s covered toe, and the tall 
young woman looked back over herself as the warmth slowly filtered 
through the light cloth.
    
    &quot;Michiru, look, we have company.&quot;
    
    Beneath her lover, Michiru&#39;s eyes didn&#39;t even quiver as she 
stared up at Haruka&#39;s face. &quot;Let it be.&quot; She grew a small, prankish 
smile. &quot;If you have enough energy to joke then you can find me 
something to eat.&quot;
    
    Haruka had always been quick with her witty comebacks, as they 
both had to be around each other, but to her surprise Haruka just 
looked down at her. Her sandy hair had grown too long and it 
delicately brushed Michiru&#39;s cheeks as Haruka let gravity press their 
bodies together once again. 
    
    &quot;Let us starve.&quot;
    
    She had been lost in the whirlwind of their passionate reunion at 
first, but now with the day moving on Michiru had noticed how much 
more intense Haruka had been. Their kiss lingered as their lips 
brushed at each other. Intense, but very delicate, she had realised. 
    
    Not that she minded in the least. She had craved it for so long 
that Haruka&#39;s touch, no matter how it came, was forever welcome. 
Michiru had been strong, she had soldiered on, but not a night had 
gone by without her wishing that somehow, someday, Haruka would be 
returned to her. The girl she had crushed on from afar, and had 
personally awakened into the ranks of the Sailor Senshi. A girl who 
knew what it was like to come from a family of money, and yet feel as 
though she had no family at all. The girl that had taken so long to 
open up to her.
    
    But it had all paid off. Their first night together had been 
magical, as had every night since. They had a strange relationship, 
Michiru was all too aware of that, but she didn&#39;t care. They had 
grown up too fast, and no-one else would ever understand their unique 
dynamic: they had not been the victims of school relationship 
fashions nor had the support of the media to know how to go about 
courting each other. 
    
    They had discovered it for themselves. 
    
    Then, having lost her love, Michiru had retreated away from the 
public eye that had come to admire her unique style and attitude. She 
had played her music, and she had painted, but not for them. She had 
needed the catharsis. She had been forced to face the cameras and 
reporters with a brave face, and had to be the support for Hotaru as 
she cried for the loss of her &#39;father&#39;. Michiru knew Setsuna had 
tried to be there for her, but Setsuna herself was a unique and 
unusual person, and there had only been so many words from her that 
could actually give comfort.
    
    Thank God, then, for their princess. Usagi had been as much a 
support to her as she herself had been to the distraught girl, 
Michiru guessed. For all the self assured attitude that she and 
Haruka seemed to have, they were only human, and still young. Michiru 
had fallen apart more than once in Usagi&#39;s caring arms, and she had 
probably made just as much of a scene as Usagi had when they had 
grieved together. At least Usagi had been able to look somewhat 
adorable when she was distressed. Michiru knew the same could never 
be said about her. Red eyed, with her hair messed and her makeup 
streaming down her cheeks, hers was not a face that could afford her 
the luxury of crying real tears.
    
    Michiru let out a small moan as Haruka&#39;s arms slipped beneath 
her, holding her so protectively.  Their bodies locked together in an 
almost perfect symmetry. If only she were taller, or Haruka shorter, 
it would not have been an &#39;almost&#39;. She could not wait to stroll out 
in public again, her arm in Haruka&#39;s for everyone to see. 
    
    But wait she would, as Haruka&#39;s legs entwined themselves more 
closely with hers. This was time for themselves alone. 
&quot;Incorrigible,&quot; she whispered with that smile of hers as she wrapped 
her arms around Haruka&#39;s body.
    
    &quot;If you have the energy to joke,&quot; Haruka replied, her face hidden 
in Michiru&#39;s hair, &quot;then make love to me!&quot; 
    
    Had she been able to see Haruka&#39;s expression, Michiru would have 
paused at how serious she seemed. However, she didn&#39;t get a chance to 
fulfil that wish as the bedroom door was suddenly slammed open and in 
dashed their teenaged adopted daughter, her face glowing brilliantly 
at the promise of seeing her &#39;father&#39; again.
    
    &quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;  
    
    Or at least, it was until she saw just what she had barged in on. 
&quot;Whaa..!&quot; the young, bob-haired girl exclaimed, before her face lit 
up red and she spun around, clutching her schoolbag to her chest. 
    
    &quot;Michiru-mama! Haruka-papa! It&#39;s the middle of the afternoon!&quot; 
she all but yelled before retreating back out of the room, closing 
the door behind her.
    
    Then, through the wood, Haruka and Michiru heard her small, 
sobbing voice. &quot;Haruka-papa, I missed you!&quot;
    
    A moment later Haruka opened the door, wearing only a simple 
dressing gown. Hotaru looked up to her from her place crouched by the 
door, and Haruka offered a hand to her daughter. &quot;I&#39;m missed you too 
Hotaru-chan. You don&#39;t know how much I missed you.&quot;
    
    Hotaru nodded, taking her hand and finding herself in a warm, 
comforting hug as she cried her happy eyes out. &quot;Haruka-papa!&quot;

***
    
    Minako looked over the plate of biscuits that Usagi set before 
her, and she couldn&#39;t help but fawn over the girlish designs. &quot;How 
cute!&quot;
    
    Usagi nodded, coloured with faint embarrassment at the praise. 
&quot;Aren&#39;t they?&quot;
    
    Ami took one of the small, bunny shaped cookies, as if studying 
it. &quot;It almost seems a shame to eat them.&quot;
    
    Usagi didn&#39;t have that problem, and popped one into her mouth. 
&quot;What else are biscuits for?&quot; However, after a few chews her happy 
little grin faded. &quot;They&#39;re still not sweet enough.&quot;
    
    Minako blinked at her, a pair of the baked rabbit ears sticking 
out from her lips. &quot;Really?&quot; She took a few more chews of her own. &quot;I 
think they&#39;re okay.&quot;
    
    Ami nodded in agreement. She could tell what Usagi meant, they 
were a little plain compared to Makoto&#39;s treats, but then none of 
them could have matched Makoto for cooking skills, least of all 
herself. &quot;Don&#39;t be hard on yourself Usagi-chan. You have improved a 
lot since moving in here.&quot;
    
    Usagi sighed and sat back on her pillow, munching thoughtfully. 
&quot;I suppose so. I&#39;ve got a long way to go though. Being a wife is 
really hard, and I&#39;m not even married yet.&quot;
    
    &quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami scolded affectionately, &quot;there is more to being 
Mamoru-kun&#39;s wife than cooking for him.&quot;
    
    &quot;But I still want to,&quot; Usagi replied, remembering her old 
daydreams. &quot;I know I can&#39;t be the perfect wife, but I still want to 
try. I don&#39;t want to be a useless woman who can&#39;t do anything.&quot;
    
    Minako found it hard to get her head around that, for one simple 
reason. &quot;Being Sailor Moon is useless now?&quot;
    
    Curled up beside the table Luna agreed. &quot;You might still have a 
lot to learn about homemaking Usagi, but you do have other things to 
worry about that normal girls don&#39;t.&quot;
    
    Usagi smiled at the complement and rewarded Luna with a biscuit 
for her trouble. &quot;Thanks Luna.&quot;
    
    Sitting beside Minako Artemis eyed the free goody enviously. 
&quot;Hey, why does Luna get the cookie?&quot;
    
    &quot;Because she can be supportive of a girl&#39;s efforts,&quot; Minako 
replied, as if quoting from some great book of common familial lore.
    
    &quot;Well I can tell her how good they are once I&#39;ve tried one,&quot; 
Artemis replied, a little sour, but Usagi just smiled at him and 
passed another bunny biscuit over to his side of the table.
    
    &quot;No-one gets left out in my house,&quot; she said proudly as Artemis 
nodded in thanks and started to chow down.
    
    In moments the confection was gone, and he smacked his lips 
thoughtfully. &quot;Well, it was a little bland, but far better than 
anything Minako&#39;s ever made!&quot;
    
    Sitting politely next to him Minako didn&#39;t say a word as she 
knocked her knuckles over the back of her cat&#39;s head.
    
    &quot;Hey, I was complimenting the biscuit!&quot; Artemis defended weakly, 
while Minako glared at him.
    
    &quot;You didn&#39;t have to insult me at the same time,&quot; she growled.
    
    &quot;Now now,&quot; Ami said, trying to mollify them and failing to see 
how they could slip back into old habits so easily. &quot;Let&#39;s not start 
that when we&#39;ve only just arrived.&quot;
    
    For her own part Usagi just giggled. &quot;Well *I* appreciate it 
Artemis. I&#39;ll make sure Mum gives you a proper supper tonight, not 
just the tinned stuff.&quot; Then she realised that it wasn&#39;t really her 
place to be offering such favours any more. &quot;Oh, but I guess you&#39;ll 
be moving back in with Minako-chan, won&#39;t you?&quot;
    
    Artemis just put his nose up in the air. &quot;Not if she treats me 
like that I won&#39;t,&quot; he sniffed comically.
    
    Minako just mirrored his gesture. &quot;Well I&#39;m sure Mama will be 
happy not to have to feed you again.&quot;
    
    Ami shook her head. Sometimes her friends worried her. &quot;You 
two...&quot;
    
    &quot;Well,&quot; Usagi sighed, looking at the clock, &quot;I&#39;d better go, or 
I&#39;ll be late for Michiru&#39;s lesson again. Thanks for coming guys. It&#39;s 
really nice to have you back.&quot;
    
    &quot;Huh?&quot; Minako blinked in surprise. &quot;We&#39;re going? Since when have 
you had lessons besides college?&quot;
    
    &quot;Michiru-san has been teaching you?&quot; Ami asked. The very idea of 
Usagi asking for tutelage impressed her. She knew from long 
experience just what lengths the girl would go to in order to avoid 
studying anything.
    
    &quot;Well, I guess it was just an excuse to give us something to do,&quot; 
Usagi explained. &quot;At least at first. If I want to be a proper lady, 
who better to teach me than Michiru-san?&quot;
    
    Ami beamed at her, feeling very proud of her friend. &quot;I&#39;m glad 
you have taken such good initiative Usagi-chan. I&#39;m sure Michiru-san 
has been very grateful for your company.&quot;
    
    Usagi just grinned sheepishly. &quot;And vice versa. Hotaru-chan has 
been really kind as well. Umm, you can come along if you want. I&#39;m 
sure she&#39;d love to see you all too. And you can help me stand up for 
my cookies. Michiru-san is going to grade them for me.&quot;
    
    &quot;Great!&quot; Minako beamed, &quot;Unlike some people, I have nothing to do 
until my agent gets back to me!&quot;
    
    &quot;Well, you go and have fun then,&quot; Luna said, as she got up and 
stretched. &quot;I think I will find somewhere to take a nap before I have 
to head back home. I don&#39;t want to tempt providence with the &#39;no-
pets&#39; rule in this building for longer than I have to.&quot;
    
    Artemis laughed. &quot;Especially after last time. That last pound you 
ended up in was a sty!&quot;
    
    However, as the two girls got to their feet Ami found herself 
hesitating. &quot;Actually Usagi-chan, I might not. I should probably 
start studying for my exams as soon as possible, especially after...&quot;
    
    Minako cut her off mid flow. &quot;Ami-chan.&quot; It was said with an 
understanding smile, but Minako wasn&#39;t going have that nonsense. 
&quot;You&#39;ve got time just to visit friends, right?&quot;
    
    Ami stood silent for a second before she smiled in reply. She had 
already told herself that she had avoided Haruka&#39;s company for too 
long, and for all the wrong reasons. And, after all, even if they had 
been careful around each other after the battle with Galaxia, she and 
Michiru had become friends more quickly than some of the others had. 
    
    &quot;Yes, you&#39;re right.&quot;
    
    Then, as they all made for the hallway, Artemis called after 
them. &quot;Hey. You know what, I&#39;ll come along. Someone&#39;s got to keep you 
lot out of trouble when Luna&#39;s not around.&quot;
    
    Minako turned to him and stuck out her tongue, before smiling at 
him. She wanted him there just as much as he wanted her around again. 
&quot;That&#39;s the first sensible thing you&#39;ve said all day! Come on,&quot; she 
said, flicking her hair over her should so that he could leap up and 
drape himself over his favourite perch. &quot;Better.&quot;

***
    
    Michiru had wondered whether Usagi was going to make it to their 
normal lesson. With everything that must have been going on she 
couldn&#39;t have faulted her for missing it. Likewise she had idly 
wondered whether she would even have been allowed out of bed in time 
if Hotaru hadn&#39;t intervened. 
    
    But the doorbell had rung, and there on her doorstep were the 
three young women. &quot;You came after all,&quot; she said, smiling 
beautifully at them. &quot;I would have let you off, you know. Still, I&#39;m 
glad. Ami-san, Minako-san, it has been a while.&quot;
    
    Both of them nodded, accepting the formal but friendly hugs 
Michiru gave them. Both of them had forgotten just how elegant the 
young musician was, and in Minako&#39;s eyes, how well she filled the 
role of superstar that she herself one day aspired to take on. 
&quot;Michiru-san, stylish as ever.&quot;
    
    Michiru bowed appreciatively. She was actually surprised at how 
openly friendly they both seemed to be. Before they had disappeared 
things had still been awkward between them, although they had all 
been making the effort to put the past behind them. It was quite a 
relief to see that their time away, however painful it must have been 
for them, seemed to have helped lay some of those demons to rest. 
Just as Usagi had helped her to do. Of all of the &#39;Inners&#39; it was 
Usagi&#39;s open acceptance that had most caused Michiru&#39;s guilt to well 
up, and she was thankful that she had now managed to put those 
feeling behind her. &quot;Thank you. You are all looking well. I do like 
what you have done with your hair Minako-san. It flatters you.&quot;
    
    Minako blushed at the compliment, glad that she had chosen to 
keep her netting hair veil. &quot;Hee hee, if you like it then I know I&#39;m 
onto a good thing!&quot;
    
    Then, from behind her girlfriend, Haruka made her presence known. 
&quot;If it isn&#39;t my favourite girls.&quot;
    
    Usagi didn&#39;t even hesitate in leaping over to her, almost 
tackling her in a cuddle. &quot;Haruka-san, we missed you!&quot;
    
    &quot;We missed you too dumpling,&quot; Haruka said, laying an affectionate 
hand on Usagi&#39;s head. &quot;You wouldn&#39;t believe how much.&quot;
    
    Usagi shook her head and looked up to the taller girl, her eyes 
moist. &quot;No, I would.&quot;
    
    Haruka smiled and nodded before turning to the empty hall. 
&quot;Hotaru, we have guests!&quot;
    
    Then, as they waited for the raven haired teenager to appear, 
Haruka gave Minako a hug of her own. &quot;Your folks forgave you?&quot;
    
    Minako nodded, and gave her a knowing wink. &quot;Eventually.&quot;
    
    After Minako let go Haruka turned to Ami, but the pair just 
smiled at each other. Usagi felt a curiosity fall over her at the 
strange, silent exchange between them, but beside her Michiru smiled 
an odd sort of smile as they finally gave each other a brief but 
obviously tender hug.
    
    &quot;It&#39;s good to be home, isn&#39;t it Haruka-san?&quot;
    
    &quot;Yeah. It is.&quot;
    
    When Hotaru appeared the routine was repeated once again, and the 
younger girl leaped on the chance to ask about their &#39;adventure&#39;. 
&quot;Haruka-papa hasn&#39;t told me anything!&quot; she groused, pouting with a 
quietly petulant air. One that might have been seen if you crossed 
Rei&#39;s brash wisdom with Ami&#39;s bookish and socially reserved 
intelligence.
    
    And, as Minako tried to fill her in, Michiru managed to manoeuvre 
herself next to Ami, still standing by the closed door. After what 
she had just seen it was clear that it was not just the younger girls 
who had put the past behind them. Haruka had been more worried and 
withdrawn than any of them when they used to get together, and yet 
all traces of that guilt ridden and self deprecating aura, at least 
on the surface, had been wiped away. &quot;Thank you for helping her. She 
must have been a lot to deal with.&quot;
    
    Ami shook her head, a slightly subdued smile of her own on her 
lips. &quot;No, we have all been very silly, I think. She has been a great 
help, and a wonderful friend.&quot;
    
    Michiru nodded, feeling proud of her girlfriend. Ami&#39;s praise was 
always worth a great deal to whoever received it. &quot;I&#39;m glad. Will you 
stay? You can help Usagi-san to learn the basics of cakes.&quot;
    
    Ami seemed to think for a moment, but it was an invitation she 
was too polite to refuse, and really, were her studies so important 
that she would turn down the time with her friends? &quot;I will, thank 
you. You have obviously been a great help to her.&quot;
    
    Michiru just smiled diplomatically and gave a slight nod as she 
led her chattering daughter into the kitchen. That may have been 
true, but after everything Usagi had done for her and her family she 
was not egotistical enough to accept the compliment. Where would her 
air of mystery be if she did that?
    
    &quot;Now Usagi-san, let&#39;s see how your biscuit practice turned out.&quot;
    
    From the living room Ami just watched the scene start unfolding 
and next to her, leaning on the kitchen worktop that separated the 
two rooms, Haruka watched with her, an amused smile on her face. &quot;Now 
this I have to see.&quot;
    
    Ami nodded, taking a seat. &quot;It should be... interesting,&quot; she 
agreed, knowing just who was in the kitchen trying to &#39;help&#39;.
    
    &quot;No Minako-san, that&#39;s the *plain* flour! Usagi-san, the self 
raising is the one just to the right.&quot;

***
    
    Tyranya blinked, staring up into the night sky, which had been 
filled with a bleak and un-warming midday sun only moments ago. 
    
    She groaned loudly, wondering why she hurt as she lay on the 
grass of Juuban park. There didn&#39;t seem to be a single muscle in her 
body that didn&#39;t ache, and her head throbbed painfully. She must have 
hit it when she landed.
    
    Across from her she heard Kaizi&#39;s desperate voice, and Tyranya 
viciously shook her head to try and clear it. This was no time for 
her to worry about pain. She had friends to save. She could already 
see the edges of the burning dimensional tear beginning to shrink 
inwards upon themselves as Kaizi pulled frantically at the grass 
beneath her, screaming at the portal to finally spit her out. Tyranya 
scrambled back to her and grabbed her arm, her long, sharp nails 
biting into her friend&#39;s flesh as she pulled. 
    
    &quot;Come on, let her out!!&quot; Tyranya snarled at the slowly shrinking 
disk of liquid space.
    
    As if on command both she and her companion found themselves 
hurtling backwards onto the moonlit grass, and no sooner had Kaizi 
been ejected then another pair of hands jutted through and into 
Tokyo&#39;s balmy air. Tyranya barely paused to take a breath before 
grasping at those hands and pulling again, while Kaizi could only 
look around her in ecstatic wonder. &quot;We did it! We&#39;re out!&quot;
    
    &quot;Kaizi, come on!&quot; Tyranya called back to her. &quot;We can get 
everyone! Help me, we still have time!&quot;
    
    That stern voice brought Kaizi back to the real world. &quot;Yes 
Captain!&quot; She too took the grasping hands in her own, and her 
muscular arms bulged as she put all her weight into her efforts. 
&quot;I&#39;ve got you Shivis!&quot;
    
    With a shudder the incredible hold the portal had on those 
feathered hands suddenly let up, and the tall, slim young woman 
catapulted out of the ephemeral ooze like a cork from a champagne 
bottle. &quot;Come on!&quot; Tyranya all but screamed as the doorway continued 
to shrink, now only ten feet wide at best. &quot;Where are you!?&quot;
    
    Then, to her relief, the next pair of hands emerged, and with 
them the entire upper body of her next companion. Now, as more of 
them joined their sisters in their struggle for freedom, they barely 
had to wait for the portal&#39;s slack grip to loosen before they could 
haul their next sister out of their blasted homeland. 
    
    And yet, the portal continued to shrink.
    
    &quot;We didn&#39;t put enough power into it,&quot; Shivis whispered 
sorrowfully as the flames around the liquid disk began to dissipate. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry... I didn&#39;t put enough power in to keep it open!&quot;
    
    A large, imposing woman gave her a fang-toothed smile, caught 
half way through the gate and with only enough space to breath around 
her muscular waist. She looked back at the rip she was stuck in as 
the blackness that made up its surface began to leak out into the 
air. &quot;You did your best Shivis. You found the weakness, and the fact 
that you could open it for any of us was more than we could have 
hoped for. But it&#39;s alright. Matinatia and Lapis have already gone.&quot;
    
    The raven skinned Maxill felt tears come to her eyes as she was 
told the fate of her twin. &quot;No... They didn&#39;t... WHY!!?&quot;
    
    The large woman shook her head, no longer matching Tyranya and 
Kaizi for power in trying to free herself. &quot;It is better to die than 
remain behind. We will envy you lucky ones, so live well in our 
place.&quot;
    
    Her smile began to fail her as the oily portal slipped away, it&#39;s 
disappearance creeping up through her stomach more cleanly than any 
blade could ever have cut. &quot;We love you, sisters.&quot;
    
    The survivors wept to see their oldest and proudest sister&#39;s body 
fall to the ground, the portal having severed her in two as it had 
vanished. The smallest girl, an animalistic and fox-like young thing, 
crawled to her and lifted the woman&#39;s head into her lap. &quot;Kental, 
don&#39;t go...&quot;
    
    But, while hardy, not even their kind could survive such a mortal 
wound, and Tyranya tried to comfort the girl as their friend&#39;s body 
slowly corroded away, leaving nothing but a mound of heavy, blackish 
earth to mark her passing.
    
    &quot;Be strong, Aretsuki,&quot; Tyranya whispered through her own tears, 
taking the bawling girl in her arms. &quot;You saw how brave she was. We 
have to be brave like her. Like a real soldier of the Dark Kingdom 
should always be.&quot;
    
    She looked up through her watery eyes, unafraid to let her 
weakness show through her tears. Such qualities were not to be 
ashamed of. &quot;We will be able to live here. We will grow strong and we 
will make this world our own. It will be payment for the suffering we 
have endured, and for the lives of every sister that has been taken 
from us! We must make sure that none ever suffer that fate again!&quot;
    
    She looked up to the faces of those strong souls who had survived 
with her. &quot;We shall not be snuffed out. Make sure of that, everyone. 
Nothing is more important than each other&#39;s lives. We are all we have 
left.&quot;
