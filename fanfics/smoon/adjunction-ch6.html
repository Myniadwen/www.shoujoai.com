<p>“<em>Are  you two lovers?”</em></p>
<p>Minako sighed  softly. <em>No, but why do I suddenly wish I could have answered  'yes'?</em></p>
<p>The  way to the radio station was paved clear, surprising for that hour of  the day. Or perhaps she was just so lost in her thoughts that traffic  seemed to pass by without recognition.</p>
<p>Going  around the back way and entering as an employee also helped the  dreamlike state of avoiding fans. Before Minako knew it, she was live  on the radio (and broadcast over the TVs) and she quickly had to snap  out of reverie lest she drool in front of thousands of viewers.</p>
<p>“For  those of you who are just tuning in, we are now welcoming Japan's  favorite all-time idol, Aino Minako, to Risha's Entertainment  Weekly!” Cue cheering fans on the other side of a thick glass  panel.</p>
<p>Minako  smiled and waved at the camera and the fans. <em>Maybe there was  something about those scented candles,</em> Minako's thoughts offered  as a reason for her sluggish mindset.</p>
<p>“So!”  Risha started, “Let's get it all out into the clear. Your sudden  trip home stunned many of us, Minako-chan. What was the reason behind  it? A national tour? A new album made from home sweet home?”</p>
<p>Minako remembered  just in time what her manager had told her to say. She leaned forward  towards the microphone. “Well actually, I suddenly woke up one  morning and realized I missed my fans here in Japan, so I thought I  spend a week or two here to sing at school dances and charity events  and the like, going to my fans instead of letting them come to me,  you know? It's also a bit of a vacation from the hectic schedules I  have overseas, so I do hope I can have fun with everyone in the mean  time.”</p>
<p>Risha seemed  momentarily spellbound by this for some reason, but she quickly  recovered. “Well! This is certainly a treat! I'm sure the chosen  functions will be thanking their lucky stars for the opportunity to  hear our Minako-chan sing live just for them. So, Minako-chan, what  did you think of your time overseas?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled  easily. “Without a doubt, it's an experience I'll take with me to  the grave, I've learned so much from both my peers and my rivals, but  Japan will always have 'the hometown advantage' in my mind.”</p>
<p>“Quite...  And is it true that you were so devoted to your work that you didn't  dabble in lovers at all?”</p>
<p>Despite having been  asked this several times in the past, Minako could feel a slight  blush coming on. She coughed before answering, “Aside from  affirming 'yes', I'll leave it at 'no comment'.”</p>
<p>But Risha was  persistent. “But surely you had to have met many... <em>willing</em> men, no?”</p>
<p>Minako put on a  plastic smile, lest her true one show her desire to pap the woman  upside the head and tell her to shut up. “Well... yes... but  honestly, I was only really ever interested in... well... a certain  someone back home.”</p>
<p>The moment that  slipped out Minako knew it was the wrong thing to do. She was  immediately hit by a breath-stolen silence from her fans, and the  obvious insight of Risha. “Oh? So you have a love here in Japan?  Who is it? It's surely someone as famous as you, right? A scandalous  affair? A dynamic duo? Come on, Minako-chan, you can't stop  there...!”</p>
<p>Minako inwardly  sighed, knowing she would get chewed out by her manager for her slip  up. All of a sudden, an idea popped into her head, and she prayed  that her scapegoat would forgive her for this.</p>
<p>She looked down,  using her innate acting talent to put on the most naturally forlorn,  lonesome face she could possibly have, and stage whispered, “They  are no longer in this world... so I'd rather not talk about them...  it would be... an insult to their memory.”</p>
<p>Minako knew her  quick acting had worked when a guilty look instantaneously plastered  itself onto Risha's face. Had Minako been the sort of woman that  relished in the reactions of others... this one might have made it  into her mental scrapbooks.</p>
<p>“Ah...  erm...” Risha coughed. “In that case... let's move on! Have your  favorites changed since you last answered our fans, Minako-chan? Like  your favorite color? Or clothing brand?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled easily  as she shifted according to her own will. Crisis diverted. For now at  least.</p>
<p>“Mm...  yeah, at one, can you make it?” Makoto absently swatted at Usagi's  outstretched hand before it could reach the cooling half of the  pastry.</p>
<p>“<em>Well...  I have a 12:00 appointment... but it shouldn't take too long... I  think... At Rei's shrine, you said?”</em></p>
<p>“Mmhmm.  Well, I don't think it's that big of a deal if you come a little  late... hey, I'm making a special new pastry today- no Usagi, not  yet!- ah... it's really good, you know.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ahh...  Don't say that now... I've recently had a craving for one of your  homemade pastries...”</em></p>
<p>Makoto laughed. “You  know, that's the exact same thing Minako said.”</p>
<p>Ami sighed on the  other end. “<em>Well, if I end up not making it... save me some  anyway?”</em></p>
<p>“Are  you going to swing by here then?”</p>
<p>“<em>That's  what I was thinking... though... how long will the rendezvous last,  you think?”</em></p>
<p>Makoto blew a stray  lock of hair out of her eyes. “Oh geez, I don't know. It could last  all night, considering the occasion.”</p>
<p>“<em>Oh...  well then, I'll make sure to stop by at the shrine after I finish up  here.”</em></p>
<p>A  sudden flash of inspiration hit Makoto just then... though why that <em>particular</em> flash hit her was beyond her current knowledge.  Still... “Hey... Ami-chan”</p>
<p>The other end  paused, obviously suspicious. “<em>What... what is it?”</em></p>
<p>“You  know that...” Makoto glanced at Usagi, who was still trying to  sneak a grab at the food. “<em>Place</em> you were talking about  before?”</p>
<p>“<em>Which...?  Oh no... Mako-chan, you don't seriously-”</em></p>
<p>“Why  not?” Makoto offered with a smile that she was sure Ami could  sense. “We're all of mm... legal age...”</p>
<p>“<em>But  Mako-chan...”</em></p>
<p>“You  can be my designated driver even. Or it might turn into a massive  sleepover...”</p>
<p>“<em>The...  students...”</em></p>
<p>Makoto grinned,  knowing she was breaking Ami's resolve. “Rei'll find a way to  handle 'em, I'm sure. Come on” Makoto realized she had to wrap  this up quick or else Usagi's inquisitive stare would turn into  something more... verbal.</p>
<p>“<em>Well...  okay... I'll bring it... but if Rei-chan or anyone else says 'no' you  have to respect that, all right!”<br />
</em>Makoto laughed. “Of  course, of course. So, see you then?”</p>
<p>“<em>How  are you getting there?”</em></p>
<p>“I'll  walk; it's not far from here after all. Plus it's not a warm  pastry... when it's finished anyway.”</p>
<p>“<em>I  look forward to it.”</em></p>
<p>Makoto nodded into  the phone. “Ja ne, Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ja.”</em></p>
<p>Makoto motioned for  Usagi to hang up the phone since her hands were both busy, which  Usagi obeyed. Followed by a hopeful puppy look for a 'reward'. Makoto  sighed and gave the mostly empty dough bowl to Usagi to lick off as  she desired. Which Usagi did with gusto.</p>
<p>As  Makoto finished up and set the laden tray in the oven to bake,  she washed her hands and then leaned against the wall for a moment,  relishing the thought.</p>
<p><em>Ami-chan's coming And she's going  to bring our special friend</em></p>
<p>Rei leaned against  a wooden post, more tired than she'd thought she'd be. <em>It's only  the usual cleaning, so why...?</em></p>
<p>“Rei-sama?” Rei inwardly cursed. <em>I've been found out. </em>Sakura walked up and then paused a few  feet behind her sensei. “A package just came for you. Do you want  to see it now or should I put it in your room?”</p>
<p>Rei raised an  eyebrow. <em>Okay, maybe not.</em> Rei opened her eyes and  straightened. “Who is it from?”</p>
<p>Sakura looked at  the parcel and scrutinized what was apparently not the best  handwriting in the world. “Um... Hino... ah, your father, I think?”</p>
<p>Rei closed her eyes  and leaned against the tree again. <em>Oh Kami-sama not another stupid  gift-of-the-year...</em> “Stick it in my room for now, I suppose.”</p>
<p>“Okay!” There were patterings of  feet as if Sakura were leaving... but then she stopped and turned.  “Rei-sama?”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Are you... feeling all right?”</p>
<p>Rei cursed under  her breath. “I'm fine. Don't you have duties to finish?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes, of course, I mean, I'll get  right to it! But umm... Rei-sama... were you...”</p>
<p>Rei sighed as  Sakura trailed off. Knowing she'd regret it, Rei prompted, “Was I  what, Sakura-san?”</p>
<p>Sakura gulped. She  had never seen her sensei quite so... tired before. There was only  one explanation for it. “Were you up late... because of Aino-san?  Is that why you're tired?”</p>
<p>Rei's eyes opened  halfway. <em>Tired? Do I look tired?</em> “I'm fine. Now git before I  make <em>you</em> stay up all night cleaning the bathrooms.”</p>
<p>Sakura 'eep'ed and  was out of sight before Rei could even be bothered to look in that  direction.</p>
<p>Rei glanced at her  watch. <em>It's past noon... I should probably go... eat something...</em></p>
<p>She looked around  the courtyard, finding the other students either dusting, sweeping,  or otherwise tidying up the place. She nodded with approval before  heading to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Alone, Rei got to  thinking about Minako's proposal again. She scoffed to herself. <em>Me?  A duo with the Japanese all-star? Even if I </em>was <em>on the same  level as her... </em>Rei shook her head. <em>What is that girl </em>thinking</p>
<p><em>Not to mention what would happen to  the shrine... and who says Minako's fans would be </em>my <em>fans? </em>She  scoffed again, deciding to forgo actual food and retiring to her  room, and her secret stash of Pocky, making sure to lock the door  this time.</p>
<p><em>Why the heck did  she even </em>say <em>that? She had to have known I was going to  refuse. What could she </em>really <em>have to gain by pairing up with  me? It'd only... slow her down.</em></p>
<p>A Pocky stick  received the kiss of doom... as Rei flopped down on the futon that  she had somehow forgotten to put away and chomped off half the stick  in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Her sensitive nose  twitch as she caught the unmistakable scent... She rolled over  without thinking about it.</p>
<p>It filled her in  one breath.</p>
<p>Minako's scent.</p>
<p>On her sheets.</p>
<p>Rei cursed, rolling  over again, the <em>other</em> way.</p>
<p>Somehow, it was  there too. Or was it coming from behind her...?</p>
<p>She growled,  scratching her head furiously as if the distraction would be enough  to ward off... the snippets of dreams she had had going to bed last  night... when Minako...</p>
<p>She twisted, not  wanting to lie in the same position she had... woken up in that  morning...</p>
<p>Even if only half  the dream had really contained dialogue, there was only one snippet  of a quote that Rei now remembered of it... though the actions were  so often repeated... almost night after night... they had burned  their way into her soul... like a sinful brand.</p>
<p>Rei... unknowingly  wrapping herself in the entanglements of dreams and slumber, wrestled  with herself and the attempt to ward off the dreams.</p>
<p>But it wanted to  engulf her... and the desire that fueled it was stronger than  Rei's... too strong, in fact.</p>
<p>She didn't even  hear her students raise a ruckus in the distance.</p>
<p>She didn't hear  them calling her name, searching for her.</p>
<p>She didn't hear the  jiggling of her door, affirming that it was locked.</p>
<p>She was too lost  for that.</p>
<p>But when the door  was opened with the spare-key-in-case-of-emergencies on the grounds  that Rei hadn't answered at all no matter how much they pounded?</p>
<p>When an all too  familiar scent attacked her senses like a monstrous tsunami?</p>
<p>When that sweet  voice was calling her name, in tune with shaking?</p>
<p>She felt herself  loosen her hold on the Dream World, or vice versa.</p>
<p>Just in time to  hear Minako whisper, bent low, surely, “Wakey-wakey- Rei-chan  We've got a sweet little treat here for you that even <em>you</em> can't turn down...”</p>
<p>Just in time for it  to register that Minako was <em>there</em>, in person, in the flesh,  right in her face.</p>
<p>The latter didn't  truly register until she had tried to sit up quickly in her startled  surprise...</p>
<p>And ended up  getting retro CPR from a very wide-eyed idol.</p>
<p>Goodness knows,  Rei's students were certainly surprised.</p>
<p>“Hey,” one whispered in the silence  that followed, “I thought they said they <em>weren't</em> lovers?”</p>
