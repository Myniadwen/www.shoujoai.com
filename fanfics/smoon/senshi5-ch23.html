<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>&quot;Their warriors, you said?&quot; Makoto Kino repeated, a
eager light appearing in the brown haired amazon&#39;s
eyes.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to be quite so enthusiastic,&quot; Ami
Mizuno murmured, the blue haired professor taking a
graceful drink of her tea.

&quot;It&#39;s part of her nature, Mizuno-sensei,&quot; Setsuna
smiled, her glossy black mane flowing like a cloak
around her, &quot;and we may need that quality soon
enough.&quot;

&quot;What are they capable of?&quot; Usagi Tsukino asked, all
business. She almost resembled a samurai of old,
kneeling there on the floor with her twin ponytails
dangling.

&quot;They&#39;re strong,&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;but more importantly
they use guile as well. Underestimating them could
easily be your downfall.&quot;

Minako Aino nodded slightly, the gorgeous blonde
standing slightly apart from the others. &quot;That fits
with what Artemis tells me.&quot;

Luna agreed, the little black cat looking rather
irritably towards the white cat nearby Minako. &quot;I
didn&#39;t expect them to send out the warriors so soon,&quot;
she noted, &quot;we must be worrying them.&quot;

&quot;Or my mother wants us dealt with as quickly as
possible,&quot; Usagi offered darkly.

Rei Hino shivered slightly, the black haired miko
frowning. &quot;What an odd sensation,&quot; she murmured to
herself softly.

Setsuna heard it, however and looked to Rei intently,
&quot;How so?&quot;

&quot;A chill,&quot; Rei admitted, &quot;almost as if we were being
watched...&quot;

&quot;From what direction?&quot; Setsuna dropped her voice.

&quot;Outside, in the woods,&quot; Rei answered.

&quot;Everyone, keep talking normally.&quot; Usagi commanded.
&quot;Minako,&quot; she kept her voice barely above a whisper,
unheard beneath the others talk, &quot;you&#39;re the best at
being sneaky, take Luna and Artemis and go scout
around. Send one of the cats back if you find
anything.&quot;

&quot;Right,&quot; Minako turned, a wave of golden hair flowing
around her then was simply gone. Luna and Artemis
slipped outside without a whisper of sound,
disappearing into the shadows.

&quot;Ami, do you have your weapons with you?&quot; Usagi asked
as Makoto and Rei talked on.

&quot;Two freeze bombs and my pistol,&quot; Ami smiled slightly.

&quot;Makoto, ready?&quot; Usagi asked as Rei and Ami took up
the loud conversation.

&quot;Always,&quot; Makoto grinned, &quot;I even brought my studded
gloves.&quot;

&quot;My bow is in the other room,&quot; Rei murmured as Ami and
Makoto chatted, &quot;and who knows, maybe grandpa will
want to pitch in, too.&quot;

&quot;Let&#39;s hold him in reserve,&quot; Setsuna answered wryly,
&quot;besides, I have a certain ace in the hole I ca call
on.&quot; With that she drew a curved blade from her
clothes, chanting softly over it.

&quot;Should be interesting,&quot; Usagi noted as the blade
glowed a sullen red.

Luna slipped inside a few moments later, the little
black cat moving almost utterly silent. &quot;Five of
them,&quot; she reported softly, &quot;using a scrying pool to
spy on us. They&#39;re nearby in the forest, and it seems
they don&#39;t know we&#39;re on to them.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve let my two allies know about the situation,&quot;
Setsuna said as she carefully slid the blade away,
&quot;they&#39;re on the way.&quot; She made a face, &quot;I had hoped to
hold them in reserve, but this is too good of a chance
to pass up.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do now?&quot; Makoto whispered eagerly.

Usagi reached down to hold her sword, her eyes closing
a moment. &quot;We attack and draw them out,&quot; she said
crisply, &quot;long enough for Setsuna&#39;s allies to arrive.&quot;
She tensed her muscles, taking a centering breath then
cried, &quot;NOW!&quot;

Outside the five figures were gathered around the
broken piece of birdbath, watching the conversation
that was going on curiously. The blue haired Chimera
shook her head, &quot;I wish we could hear what they were
all saying.&quot;

Manticore narrowed her eyes, her rose tinted skin
darkening slightly, &quot;And where did the other blonde
go, once she went outside?&quot;

&quot;Wait!&quot; Hydra exclaimed as the women bolted from the
room, the green skinned woman pulling back to look
around wildly.

Usagi and the others raced towards them from the
shrine, four young ladies, a cat and Setsuna racing
forward to battle. &quot;We&#39;ve got to...&quot; Gryphon said
before the brown skinned woman&#39;s voice was choked off,
a chain slipped almost silently around her neck.

Sailor V yanked up to pull the woman off balance as
the other were disoriented a moment by the sudden
attack. &quot;Damn she&#39;s strong,&quot; Sailor V hissed,
struggling to keep the chain around her throat.

Basilisk&#39;s orange hair flowed wildly as she glared,
&quot;We&#39;ve got to rescue Gryphon!&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s on her own!&quot; Manticore answered as she leapt to
dodge Artemis&#39; throwing blades, the white haired boy
grinning ferally as he raced forward, then Luna swept
in, the black haired girl tossing out her own
shuriken.

Rei sent out her arrows as fast as she could draw
them, forcing the Oni warriors back even as she landed
two shafts into the bound Gryphon. The brown skinned
figure struggled a moment, fighting the magics then
burst into flames, rapidly consumed by the power.
&quot;Scratch one!&quot; Rei called.

Ami took the two round modules and pressed down,
tossing them right at the visibly stunned Basilisk.
They exploded, liquid pouring out to engulf the orange
skinned woman in cold, sealing her in ice. Still she
struggled beneath the layers of dense cold, cracking
the ice and Ami drew her freeze gun, firing to try and
keep her sealed.

CRACK! Basilisk shattered her icy prison, panting as
she stood there, shivering slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll bleed you
dry,&quot; she hissed as she advanced towards Ami, &quot;suck
the marrow from your bones...&quot;

So distracted by her rage, Basilisk was completely
surprised by Setsuna. Without a word the woman drew
her crescent blade across her throat, a hiss of steel
sending the unearthly monster falling to the ground.
Setsuna held a hand over the body, chanting softly as
purple tendrils of light danced up into her grip.

Manticore barely had the chance to summon her own
sword as Usagi attacked, the little blondes blade
nearly invisible with the speed of her attacks.
Fighting for her life Manticore realized they had
badly underestimated these children, a move that might
cost them their lives.

Hydra parried Makoto&#39;s first blow, the second punch
rocking her backwards as she felt her lip split.
&quot;Nice,&quot; she lapped up her own blood as the green
haired woman returned the favor.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Makoto acknowledged as a punch glanced off
her brow, drawing blood. She was grinning as they
traded blows, circling each other as they sought any
moment of weakness.

Chimera ducked behind another tree, panting as the
blue haired woman dodged another flight of arrows. She
saw what Setsuna was doing and felt her blood chill,
recognizing the enchantment. &quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of
here, now!&quot; she cried.


&quot;Too late,&quot; Setsuna smiled bleakly. She raised the
sphere of purple energy as she cried out the final
invocation, &quot;DEAD SCREAM!&quot;

Chimera didn&#39;t even have the chance to scream as the
power wiped her from existence, leaving nothing but
ashes swirling to the ground. Manticore broke away
from Usagi as she shouted to Hydra, &quot;We must report to
the queen what has happened.&quot;

&quot;Not likely,&quot; the cool voice said. Before anyone could
answer a bolt of lightning descended from the
cloudless sky, striking down to where Makoto and Hydra
battled, the blast utterly destroying the Oni warrior.

&quot;Damn it Haruka, the mortal!&quot; Michiru scolded, racing
along with Ami to where Makoto had been thrown by the
powerful blast.

&quot;All of you will pay for this,&quot; Manticore took
advantage of the confusion to use her blade and cut
into the air itself, disappearing into the rip which
began to close behind her. Before it could fade away
Setsuna was there, thrusting her dagger into the rift
and holding it open.

&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; Makoto waved them off as she rose
shakily to her feet. She tossed a glare to Haruka,
&quot;And why did you have to interfere in my fight?&quot;

&quot;Yup, she&#39;s normal,&quot; Ami kept a gentle hand on her
arm.

Usagi looked at the rift, then at Setsuna. &quot;That leads
into the Oni&#39;s realm?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Setsuna said grimly, &quot;possibly right to the
queen.&quot;

&quot;Then we&#39;re going in.&quot;</pre>
