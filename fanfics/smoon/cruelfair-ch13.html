<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 13 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>	Makoto awoke the next morning to the feeling of a warm body 
snuggled up against her back.  Lips pressed gently against her shoulder 
as a hand lightly caressed her hip and thigh.  Fingers trailed up along 
her side before an arm draped over her to hug her even closer.
	Makoto turned so she was on her other side facing Ami.  Ami&#146;s 
hair was tousled, her eyes bright and happy, and her mouth was turned 
into the same sleepy grin she&#146;d been wearing when she fell asleep.  
Makoto ran her fingers through Ami&#146;s hair, brushing it back off her 
face.  She grinned back at the girl, then leaned in closer and brushed 
her lips softly against Ami&#146;s.
	&#147;Any regrets,&#148; Makoto asked quietly when she pulled away.
	&#147;None,&#148; said Ami with a shake of her head.  
	Ami reached out and pulled Makoto back to her.  Their legs 
tangled together, Makoto&#146;s toes tickling along Ami&#146;s calf.  Ami&#146;s mouth 
found its way to Makoto&#146;s collarbone and laid small kisses in a path to 
her neck as Makoto&#146;s fingers drew obscure patterns on her back.  Ami 
was just beginning to wonder if they had time for anything more 
involved when the alarm clock answered the question for her.
	With a disappointed sigh, Makoto rolled over and shut off the 
alarm.  She turned onto her back and Ami was there cuddling against her 
side before she had a chance to take a second breath.  &#147;Hey now, none 
of that,&#148; said Makoto with a smile.  She poked a finger into Ami&#146;s ribs, 
which made the other jump.  &#147;I&#146;d like to stay like this, too, but we 
have to get ready for school.&#148;
	Ami grinned.  &#147;I never thought someone would ever have to force 
me to get out of bed for school.  Least of all you.&#148;  She rolled so she 
was on her stomach, her chin resting atop her hands on Makoto&#146;s chest.  
&#147;Mako-chan, are we going to tell them?&#148;
	Makoto chewed on her lip for a second as she thought.  &#147;Well, Rei 
already knows, more or less.  Haruka does, too.  It&#146;s just a matter of 
telling everyone else.  I think we should,&#148; she said with a nod.  &#147;And 
the sooner the better, because there&#146;s something I&#146;ve realized in all 
of this.&#148;
	&#147;That they&#146;re our friends, and they&#146;ll support us no matter 
what?&#148; asked Ami.
	Makoto blinked at her.  &#147;Well, there is all of that, I suppose.  
But I was thinking more along the lines that between the two of us, we 
can&#146;t keep a secret worth a damn.&#148;  She reached around and ruffled 
Ami&#146;s hair.  &#147;Come on.  I&#146;ll start breakfast while you take a shower.&#148;
	Makoto got out of bed and pulled on her nightshirt before Ami and 
her teasing eyes could stop her.  She was halfway through her 
livingroom when the glare off the balcony made her stop.
	&#147;Hey, Ami,&#148; she called to the girl, waving her over.  &#147;Come take 
a look at this.&#148;
	Ami, dressed only in a robe with a towel slung over her shoulder, 
went to stand beside Makoto.  The world outside Makoto&#146;s glass doors 
was covered in white, the newly risen sun reflecting off the stuff and 
making everything unusually bright.  There was at least a foot of snow 
piled up on the balcony and just as much on the ground below.
	Makoto put an arm around Ami&#146;s shoulders.  &#147;Maybe they canceled 
school,&#148; she said as she pulled Ami so her back was to the glass.  &#147;I 
can think of some much more interesting ways to spend my day than in a 
classroom.&#148;
	Makoto leaned in and nuzzled her lips just below Ami&#146;s ear as her 
hand moved down and loosened the robe&#146;s sash.  Reaching inside the robe, 
Makoto&#146;s fingers sketched light circles around Ami&#146;s belly button.  She 
could feel the muscles contract as the girl tried not to giggle or 
squirm away from the tickle of her finger tips.  Finally, she rested 
her hand flat against Ami&#146;s stomach.
	&#147;I wish my belly was still this flat,&#148; said Makoto as her hand 
gently stroked the soft skin.
	Ami smiled and brought a hand up to cup Makoto&#146;s cheek.  &#147;I don&#146;t 
know,&#148; she said in a slightly teasing tone.  She let her hand fall to 
the curve of Makoto&#146;s stomach.  With a finger, she traced along the 
diameter and then up to the ample swell of Makoto&#146;s breasts.  &#147;I kind 
of like you all rounded like this.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s laugh wound up a hiss as Ami&#146;s fingers found her nipple 
through the fabric of her nightshirt.  &#147;Maybe&#133;  Maybe we should check 
the news and see if there&#146;s been any cancellations.&#148;
	&#147;Good idea,&#148; agreed Ami.
	Before either girl could let go of the other, a loud thwack 
sounded as a snowball landed against the glass door.
	Makoto smirked.  &#147;I know where that came from, those nosey little 
devils,&#148; she said as she pulled away from Ami and went over to the 
closet.  Pulling out her boots and jacket, she continued, &#147;That one had 
to come from Aki.  Ruri&#146;s arm isn&#146;t that good.&#148;
	Once her boots and jacket were on, Makoto opened the balcony door 
and stepped out, ignoring the looks Ami shot her for not putting on a 
pair of pants first.  Her eyes scanned the balcony that sat near the 
corner where the two outer walls met, searching for the twin girls.  
After a second, her eyes spotted identical hot pink tassels peeking up 
over an upturned bench.
	&#147;I wonder where that snowball came from,&#148; she said loudly with 
exaggerated curiosity.  &#147;Hey, Ami, any ideas?&#148; she called through the 
open door.
	The question was greeted by a pair of giggles.  Two little heads 
popped up, both identical from the braids in their hair to the daisy 
pulls on their boot zippers.  Not for the first time, Makoto wished 
their mother would dress them differently so she would have some way to 
tell them apart.  Some way other than Aki&#146;s pitching arm, anyway.
	&#147;Hi, Mako-chan,&#148; called the twin on the right.  &#147;We&#146;re building a 
fort.  Mom said we could.&#148;
	&#147;Do you and Ami wanna come play with us?&#148; asked the twin on the 
left.
	Before Makoto could find a polite way to say she and Ami were 
having a better time playing by themselves, the door behind the twins 
opened.  &#147;Good morning, Kino-san,&#148; said their mother.  &#147;I hope these 
two weren&#146;t bothering you this early in the morning.&#148;
	Aki and Ruri looked insulted at that.  As if snowball fights and 
fort building weren&#146;t the most important things in the day, especially 
when it was the first snow of the season.
	&#147;They&#146;re never a bother, Matsumoto-san,&#148; answered Makoto politely.  
&#147;Actually, we were all hoping we&#146;d have the day off so we could enjoy 
the snow.&#148;
	The older woman smiled.  &#147;No cancellations in this district, I&#146;m 
afraid.  All you&#146;re going to get is a two hour delay while they clear 
off the roads.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s better than nothing,&#148; replied Makoto.  She scooped up a 
small handful of snow and formed it into a ball.  &#147;Isn&#146;t that right, 
Aki?&#148;
	The twin on the left grinned hugely and scooped up her own 
snowball.  Ruri squealed excitedly and ducked back behind the bench, 
out of the line of fire.  Their mother, smart woman that she was, moved 
back inside and quickly closed the door.  On her side of the complex, 
Ami followed suit and left Makoto to her own devices as the brunette 
engaged in a brief snowball war with a six-year-old.
	When Makoto came in a short time later, the livingroom was empty.  
&#147;Ami,&#148; she called as she unzipped her jacket and pulled off her boots.  
Both landed in a wet pile by the doors.
	&#147;In the kitchen,&#148; answered Ami.  &#147;I&#146;ll be out in a minute.&#148;
	True to her word, Ami returned to the livingroom and took a seat 
on the couch beside Makoto.  She handed her one of the hot mugs of tea 
she was carrying.
	&#147;Thanks,&#148; said Makoto as she took the mug between both of her 
hands.  &#147;It&#146;s cold out there.&#148;
	&#147;I told you to put on pants,&#148; said Ami.
	&#147;That wouldn&#146;t have saved me from Aki&#146;s snowballs,&#148; returned 
Makoto.  &#147;We have a two hour delay, by the way.&#148;
	Ami grinned, then set her mug down on the coffee table.  She 
pulled her legs up under her and leaned against Makoto&#146;s side, laying 
her head on the taller girl&#146;s shoulder and ignoring the chill that came 
off her body from being outside.  &#147;Mako-chan,&#148; she said as she twirled 
a damp strand of Makoto&#146;s hair around her finger, &#147;I&#146;d like to ask a 
favor.&#148;
	Makoto smiled around her mug.  She took a slow sip of the hot 
liquid, then set it on the end table beside her.  She moved her arm 
behind Ami and settled it around her shoulders.  &#147;What&#146;s that?&#148; she 
asked.
	&#147;Before we tell the others, I&#146;d like to speak with Rei 
privately,&#148; answered Ami.  &#147;After everything I&#146;ve made her listen to, 
she deserves that much.&#148;
	Makoto nodded as she thought about just how much Rei had listened 
to.  Through a small laugh that left Ami looking confused, Makoto 
agreed and said she thought it was a good idea.  Then, &#147;What about your 
mother?&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; answered Ami honestly.  &#147;I&#146;ve considered how I 
would tell her, but this was all so terribly sudden.  I wasn&#146;t 
expecting to have to say anything to her on the matter for quite some 
time, not to mention this isn&#146;t something I&#146;m terribly comfortable 
having to discuss with her at all.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s fingers came up and stroked Ami&#146;s cheek.  &#147;We&#146;ve got 
time,&#148; she said gently.  &#147;Think about how you want to handle it and 
we&#146;ll do whatever you want.&#148;
	&#147;Thank you,&#148; said Ami as her arms wrapped loosely around Makoto.
	Pulling her closer, Makoto kissed the top of Ami&#146;s head.  &#147;Come 
on,&#148; she said.  &#147;We need to get ready for school.  And since I&#146;m 
already wet and freezing, I get the shower first.&#148;  Then she grinned.  
&#147;You could always join me.  In the interest of conserving time and 
water, of course.&#148;
	Ami smiled.  &#147;Of course.  What a good idea, Mako-chan.&#148;
	Makoto smiled back the whole time as Ami pulled her into the 
bathroom, then helped her out of her cold clothes and into a warm 
shower.  Yeah, she thought, there were lots of better ways to spend the 
morning than in a classroom.


*            *            *

	A few hours later, fed, dressed, and bundled against the cold, 
Ami and Makoto headed out to meet the others.
	They spotted Rei and Minako in the usual spot.  Just as Makoto 
raised her hand to wave, Usagi came running up behind them&#133; And then 
went sliding right passed them as her feet hit a patch of ice and lost 
what little traction they had.  Arms pinwheeling, she let out a warning 
scream right before crashing into Minako.  Both girls went down in a 
tangle of arms and legs.
	A chaotic struggle ensued as the two on the ground tripped over 
each other trying to find purchase to pull themselves up while the 
three left standing tried to help them.  Rei was the first to find a 
free hand.  She took it and gave a tug, pulling Usagi forward out of 
the mess and onto her knees.
	Usagi looked up at her savior with a slightly pained expression 
on her face.  &#147;Thanks, Rei,&#148; she said as one hand rubbed the sore spot 
on her hip before Rei took that one as well and pulled Usagi to her 
feet.
	Makoto reached out a hand to Minako.  &#147;You okay?&#148; she asked.
	The blonde was holding her shoulder and through a grimace 
answered, &#147;Yeah.  I&#146;ll live.&#148;  She reached for the hand Makoto offered.  
When their hands touched, and Minako really registered who was helping 
her, an amused leer began to form on her lips.  With more than a little 
suggestiveness, she asked Makoto.  &#147;And how are you this morning?&#148;
	&#147;Um&#133; I&#146;m fine,&#148; answered Makoto hesitantly, a blush forming 
across her cheeks.  Out of the corner of her eye, she noticed Usagi 
trying to hide a giggle as Rei rolled her eyes.
	Once Minako was on her feet, that insufferable &#145;I know something&#146; 
grin still on her face, Rei walked over to her, dragging Usagi with her.  
Rei put a hand on Minako&#146;s back and forced her to start walking.
	&#147;Let&#146;s go,&#148; said Rei as she led the two blondes forward.  &#147;They 
gave us a two hour head start, so we won&#146;t have any excuses for being 
late.&#148;
	They&#146;d only gone a few steps when Rei&#146;s charges broke away from 
her and hung back to walk beside Ami and Makoto.  Usagi walked beside 
Makoto and smiled up at the taller girl when Makoto looked down at her 
suspiciously.  Minako had taken up residence beside Ami.  She spent 
several minutes stealing sideways glances at the girl until she was 
certain Ami knew she was being observed.  Then Usagi and Minako looked 
at each other, smiled conspiratorially, and nodded once in agreement.
	Minako leaned in close to Ami&#146;s ear and whispered so only she 
could hear, &#147;Hey, Ami.  You&#146;re walking funny.&#148;
	Ami stopped dead, her eyes going wide and her cheeks instantly 
flaming red.
	&#147;What&#146;s the matter?&#148; asked Makoto when Ami refused to budge from 
where she stood.
	Ami&#146;s head was down, her eyes staring at her shoes so she 
wouldn&#146;t have to look anyone in the eye.  Her response to Makoto&#146;s 
question was a swift shake of her head and a small sound that would 
have been &#145;no&#146; if she&#146;d spoken a little louder.
	&#147;All right,&#148; said Rei, putting her hands on her hips and looking 
sternly at Minako and Usagi.  &#147;What did you two do to her?&#148;
	&#147;We were just teasing a little,&#148; answered Minako in their defense.  
&#147;It&#146;s only fair after all the stuff we had to listen to after they 
caught us together.&#148;
	A smirk formed on Makoto&#146;s face.  &#147;You know.&#148;
	Three heads nodded.  
	&#147;Not worth a damn,&#148; mumbled Makoto to herself with a chuckle.
	Then Rei said, &#147;You were looking pretty primed last night.  And 
after what we talked about, I thought you might take a chance.  But I 
was gonna come after you if you didn&#146;t,&#148; she added with a grin.
	&#147;And Luna stopped by to check on you last night,&#148; said Usagi.  
Then, when Ami&#146;s eyes slammed shut and her face got even redder, she 
quickly added, &#147;But you two were asleep.  She didn&#146;t see anything.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s just so totally unfair,&#148; complained Minako, a great deal 
of humor behind her words.  &#147;When you guys walked in on us, I was 60 
seconds away from what would have been the best orgasm of my life, and 
that completely ruined it.  Luna could have at least caught you guys 
kissing or something.&#148;
	&#147;Okay, that&#146;s enough,&#148; said Rei.  A devilish smile appeared on 
her features.  &#147;If you keep talking like that, Ami&#146;s head is going to 
explode.  Mako-chan, take care of your girlfriend.  Everyone else, 
leave the poor, little popped cherry alone and get moving,&#148; ordered Rei.  
She turned and started walking away.  &#147;Let&#146;s go, because if I&#146;m late 
I&#146;m going to have an irritated nun on my case.  And there is nothing in 
this world worse than an irritated nun.&#148;
	Usagi flashed a thousand watt smile at Makoto, then, after the 
other girl had returned it with a smile of her own, started running 
after Rei.
	Ami stood where she was, still refusing to either move or open 
her eyes.
	Minako put a hand on her friend&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;I was just playing 
around, Ami,&#148; she said apologetically.  &#147;I thought it would be easier 
on you guys if we didn&#146;t take things too seriously.  I&#146;m sorry if I 
embarrassed you.&#148;
	Makoto moved closer to Ami&#146;s side so Ami could feel she was 
beside her.  &#147;Ami?&#148;
	Ami moved her head a bit and slowly opened one eye.  Makoto 
smiled at her and Ami opened her other eye and returned the smile shyly.  
Then she turned to Minako, the smile turning to a look of worry.
	&#147;Forgive me?&#148; asked Minako.
	Very quietly, Ami answered, &#147;I&#146;m not upset with you, Minako.  
But,&#148; she licked her lips nervously, &#147;can you really tell?&#148;
	Minako had to bite her lip to keep from laughing.  &#147;Honest, Ami,&#148; 
she managed to get out with a straight face, &#147;it was only a joke.  No 
one&#146;s going to know anything unless you tell them.&#148;
	&#147;Swear?&#148;
	Minako put her hand over her heart.  &#147;I swear.&#148;  She grabbed 
Ami&#146;s arm and started pulling her forward, Makoto following beside them.  
&#147;Now, you guys have to tell me everything.  I can&#146;t wait to hear about 
this.  Pregnant sex.  Ha!&#148;


*            *            *

	Seki sat in his car, a fair distance away from the street corner 
the girls always stopped at.  It was too damn cold to be out here today, 
and the school delays weren&#146;t making things any easier.  But he had a 
job to do, and he was going to do it so he could get on a plane and go 
back home.
	Spotting the girls, he took a quick drag off his cigarette, then 
lifted his camera.  The group dynamics were a bit different today than 
they had been the other times he&#146;d followed them here.  The blonde with 
the ponytails -- for the life of him, he couldn&#146;t remember her name -- 
was hanging onto Rei.  Minako was pulling on the doctor&#146;s daughter and 
the pregnant one.
	Seki adjusted his lens and took a few shots.  The new camera 
worked like a dream, the telephoto lens making it possible for him to 
stay far enough back that they wouldn&#146;t see him.
	When they finally stopped, the situation he was used to presented 
itself.  Rei and Minako moved away from the others to say goodbye to 
each other.  Not that Seki could really hear them.  Over the last few 
months, he was sorry that he couldn&#146;t, because the way they were saying 
goodbye was becoming more and more open.
	Today, Minako had her arms around Rei&#146;s neck.  Rei&#146;s hands were 
resting on the blonde&#146;s waist as they stood in the middle of the 
sidewalk and engaged in a rather intimate kiss.
	The cute, blue haired one, Ami, looked more embarrassed by it 
than usual.  More like she had when the two lovebirds first came out.  
Seki could relate.  He&#146;d nearly swallowed his tongue the first time he 
saw them kissing.  At least back then they&#146;d had the decency to be 
discrete about how affectionate they were in public.  Now it was a free 
show for anyone walking by.
	A few rapid shutter clicks and Seki had all he needed for this 
trip.  He packed up his gear and waited for the girls to leave.  Once 
they were far enough out of sight, he started the car and headed back 
to the hotel.  If he was lucky, the airport would be clear and his 
plane would take off on schedule.
