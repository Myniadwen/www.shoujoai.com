<h1>Eien no Nedan (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eiennedan-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Haruka found herself on her feet and standing at the window before she 
knew what had awakened her. The moonlit night was quiet, except for 
the soft hiss of the wind. She scanned the yard, and was aware of a 
vague sense of unease, but could find nothing specific that looked or 
felt wrong. Nonetheless, she did not move from her position. She put 
one hand on the French door, but did not move to open it. 

In the moonlight, her hand looked a ghostly, pallid color. She lifted 
her hand from the window, and held it in front of her. She brought her 
left hand up and turned them both over, gazing at them in the liquid 
silver light. 

------------------------------------------------------------

It had been raining, no, teeming, as she had sat in the window ledge 
of her apartment in Tokyo. The phone had rung and the answering 
machine had picked up the call. It was Eudial, gloating, threatening 
even as she offered a deal - a deal that was clearly an invitation to 
a trap. 

Haruka had listened impassively as the inept woman called back and 
finished her smug message. Michiru had entered towards the end of the 
message, toweling her hair. 

Haruka had looked at her hands, thinking of the deeds they had done, 
the lives she had hurt, the damage she had caused, the mission she had 
sworn to fulfill. She hadn&#39;t spoken out loud, but Michiru came over to 
her and touched her. 

&quot;I like your hands.&quot; she had said, answering the unspoken comment. A 
thought had flashed into Haruka&#39;s head at that moment, a memory of the 
two of them vowing that they would have no time for love until they 
had completed their mission. 

Haruka&#39;s eyes widened as their fingers intertwined. As she gazed into 
the blue eyes that looked up at her, Haruka had realized the magnitude 
of their folly, how huge a lie that vow had been. For it had been a 
lie, and Haruka could see it written clearly in Michiru&#39;s face. As if 
Michiru had hit her with Deep Submerge, Haruka lost her breath and 
began to drown in the truth that Michiru&#39;s eyes now told her. 

Michiru loved her, whatever she had said, mission or no mission. And 
Haruka could no longer deny what she knew to be true. She loved 
Michiru, more than she could ever express. And they were meant to be 
together. They both knew it and they both had lied. And now they had 
run out of time. They had an appointment with Eudial and the 
Talismans...and their deaths. 

The rained had stopped. So had time. 

Michiru had stood and Haruka had followed her. Michiru reached up and 
clasped her hands around Haruka&#39;s neck, drew her in and they kissed. 
It seemed that time would stand still as long as they needed it to. 
The storms clouds had rolled back and the sun began to fill the 
apartment with amber light. Michiru had run her hands through hair 
that now burst into golden flame. Haruka had not broken their embrace, 
even as they had lowered themselves to the tatami.... 

------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka looked up sharply, drawing herself back from the bittersweet 
memory. Sweet, she thought with a smile, as sweet as Michiru&#39;s lips, 
but the smile faded as she recalled the pain she had felt upon seeing 
Eudial pull the trigger and blast Michiru&#39;s crystal heart out of her 
body. Haruka had thought that her own heart would burst, but to her 
dismay it had continued to beat, just as if nothing had happened, as 
if Michiru was not laying on the floor of the cathedral, lifeless. 

Usagi had not understood then, and maybe Haruka hadn&#39;t either, not 
fully, that death with Michiru would have been a blessing; a cessation 
of the loneliness that threatened to swallow her, and relief from the 
horrible mission they had sworn to complete. 

Haruka breathed deeply, steadying herself and focused her attention on 
the night outside. She heard, or rather felt, a slight movement from 
the trees. She knew that it was this that had awakened her, but what 
*it* was, she could not say. Her hand went once again to the door, and 
once again, she stayed herself. 

Haruka quieted her mind, searching out the wrongness she felt...there! 
Her gaze fell on a shadow among the trees in the yard. It moved. Not 
with the branches that swayed gently, but with a unnatural, stealthy 
motion. She gave the French door a push and began to step outside. In 
the glass she saw the reflected flash of light from Michiru&#39;s mirror, 
and she was aware, as she stepped onto the balcony of a quiet, strong 
presence at her back. One step, two, and then she stopped dead in her 
tracks. 

Looking down into the yard, Haruka could clearly see several dark 
forms, like shadow puppets, all angles and exaggerated shapes, 
orbiting slowly around a lone figure. Sailor Saturn stood in the ring 
of darkness, her violet light fighting against a blackness that 
threatened to eclipse...no, swallow it. With one motion Haruka 
launched herself over the balcony and transformed as she did so. With 
a muffled thump, Sailor Uranus landed, rolled and ran for the circle, 
drawing her Sword, before the figures even had time to turn. 

&quot;Space Sword Blaster!&quot; she cried, and cut one shadow-form neatly in 
half. She spun, blocked behind her as she drew the sword across her 
back, then pulled down diagonally from behind her right shoulder, 
slicing through one figure, then thrusting into another. As her sword 
penetrated the figures, they disappeared, but more came forward to 
replace them. Sailor Uranus lost sight of Sailor Saturn, except when 
the Glaive&#39;s blade flashed in the moonlight. 

&quot;Submarine Reflection!&quot; Sailor Neptune&#39;s voice made Sailor Uranus 
smile grimly at her opponents. Three shadow creatures were obliterated 
as light shot out of Sailor Neptune&#39;s Mirror. Sailor Uranus stepped 
into the swirl of darkness that surrounded Sailor Saturn. She heard no 
noise, as she drew her sword across limbs, or thrust into torsos. 
Where one shadow disappeared another appeared somewhere else. The 
circle was getting smaller now, her sword&#39;s radiance grew a little 
dimmer. In a moment, she, Sailor Neptune and Sailor Saturn would be 
back to back, in the center of the engulfing darkness. As the figures 
drew closer, they seemed to block out the moonlight and even absorb 
sound. Sailor Uranus felt herself bump up against Sailor Neptune. 

Silence. A deep, horrifying non-sound fell around Sailor Uranus&#39; ears. 
She felt as if she was going blind and deaf all at once. Her hand fell 
limp and her Talisman disappeared. She opened her mouth to shout, but 
nothing sound emerged. She felt as if she were wrapped in a shroud. 
The blackness deepened... 

Then slowly, as if from very far away, came a soft sound. The sound of 
a staff being swung, the sound of a naginata... or a... Sailor Uranus 
strained to hear it, it was so familiar. Like a beacon, the sound took 
on a resonance, straining at the non-sound, pushing it back. The 
rhythm of the spinning staff grew, vibrating with life. Sailor Uranus 
felt it in her body, as her heart beat stronger with every pass of the 
staff... the weapon... what was it, it was so familiar. Comprehension 
came like a burst dam, through the dullness of her mind...the Glaive! 
A Glaive now spinning with incredible speed and power. Sailor Uranus 
spun around to see Sailor Saturn standing before her and Sailor 
Neptune, warding off the shadow shapes, pushing them back with her 
Glaive. 

Sailor Saturn increased the complexity of the pattern, now cutting 
into one shadow, or another. The humming of the spinning Glaive filled 
Sailor Uranus with new power and her sword sprang into her hand, 
shining brightly. She could see the flash of the Mirror on one side 
and hear the hum of the spinning Glaive on her other. Sailor Uranus 
closed her eyes and allowed herself to match Sailor Saturn&#39;s pattern, 
until both blades echoed through the quiet night. As if an unspoken 
signal was given, all three Senshi called out, as one. 

&quot;Submarine Reflection!&quot; &quot;Space Sword Blaster!&quot; &quot;Silence Wall!&quot; 

Gold, silver and violet light combined, flared, and encompassed the 
shadow figures. As the light touched them, they burst into a black 
stream of energy, and disappeared without a sound. 

Silence, the normal, busy, night silence, fell around the three women. 
Sailor Uranus kneeled, catching her breath. She flexed her hands and 
arms, trying to undo the thickness the shadow creatures had brought 
upon her. She turned to check Sailor Neptune, who was swaying 
slightly, but stood. With their brows drawn together, the two women 
slowly turned, knowing, fearing, what they would see. 

Sailor Saturn stood, leaning lightly on her Glaive. She smiled a 
little sadly at them. She had grown another inch or two and now stood 
almost as tall as Michiru. 

&quot;I think,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;it&#39;s time to talk to the other Senshi.&quot; 
And her hands fell softly to her side, as she collapsed to her knees. 

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Haruka and Michiru cried out as one, and both caught the 
girl in their arms, as she swayed. The Glaive disappeared as Hotaru&#39;s 
transformation reversed itself, leaving the girl barefooted, in 
pajamas now too small for her. 

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Michiru felt for a pulse and sucked in a breath as she found 
one, slow, but strong. Hotaru&#39;s eyes fluttered, but they did not open. 

Haruka picked up the girl and walked back towards the house without 
speaking. Michiru trailed her, carrying her mirror as if it were 
extremely heavy. Both women looked grimly at the sun that broke past 
the horizon and shone on their faces. It wasn&#39;t the sun they needed 
now, it was the Moon. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka leaned on the doorframe, hands in her pockets. She looked out 
over the crowded living room. It always seemed so large, she 
reflected, until we have a family get-together. She smiled a little at 
her own joke, and looked over her shoulder at Michiru, who was 
bringing in a tray from the kitchen. 

Haruka reached over and took the tray from Michiru, and gestured for 
her to sit. 

&quot;You&#39;re still weak. Please...I&#39;ll do this.&quot; Haruka let her hands 
linger over Michiru&#39;s. 

Bright blue eyes, a little strained, met hers. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Michiru 
squeezed Haruka&#39;s hands and gave her the tray. &quot;Are you sure you are 
alright?&quot; she asked the taller woman. &quot;I saw you lose your 
Talisman...&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; Haruka said shortly. She didn&#39;t want to bring this up yet. 
The Inner Senshi were so young and this burden was so large... 

Michiru&#39;s eyes narrowed, as if she was reading Haruka&#39;s mind. &quot;Haruka. 
We need to tell them - everything.&quot; 

&quot;I know. It&#39;s hard to remember that they are grown. And it&#39;s hard to 
not want to take it all on myself.&quot; 

Michiru smiled softly. &quot;I know. It is hard. But we are stronger 
together...&quot; a loud burst of laughter drew their attention. Chibi-Usa 
was relating a story of the antics of the future Senshi, and all the 
girls were giggling, with the exception of a deeply embarrassed 
Makoto, and Minako, who if not embarrassed, certainly looked 
chagrined. 

Haruka carried the tray into the room and placed it on the central 
table. Hands reached out for drinks and in a moment the tray was 
nearly empty. Haruka pushed the tray into the center of the table and 
left it, to stand by Michiru. Lightly cradling Michiru&#39;s body in the 
crook of one arm, Haruka allowed herself to relax just a little. 
Things would be alright, she reminded herself. They were stronger 
together... 

Setsuna called everyone to attention and briskly got down to business. 
Haruka spent the time watching everyone&#39;s faces, gauging their 
reactions, their responses. Predictably there was an outburst of shock 
and denial, questions and an outpouring of concern. Haruka noted the 
calm stillness that came from Mamoru and the equally powerful air of 
caring and love that Usagi radiated. It was almost as if the essence 
of their true natures as Prince and Princess had begun to coalesce 
about these two. 

Haruka noted that, when Usagi now spoke, every eye turned towards her 
and they listened, perhaps more carefully than they once had, to what 
she had to say. Even Chibi-Usa treated Usagi with a bit more respect. 
Imperceptible to one who did not know them, Haruka considered with a 
grin, as she watched Chibi-Usa spear a tidbit off of Usagi&#39;s plate and 
Usagi slap the girl down. 

Haruka and Michiru related their accounts of the morning&#39;s events. It 
was difficult, but Haruka told them of losing her Talisman, and the 
weakness that Sailor Saturn had rescued her from. Michiru supported 
Haruka, commenting that she too had lost her Talisman for a moment 
before her power returned. 

Eventually the topic turned towards possible action. Haruka listened 
closely, looking for signs of weakness in the younger women, signs 
that did not appear. She was gratified by the inner strength in their 
bearing, and the wisdom in their words. 

The door opened and all conversation ceased. All heads swiveled to 
watch as Hotaru entered the room. Her face was drawn, but she stood 
straight and tall, and her step was firm. Chibi-Usa launched herself 
at her friend and hugged her in relief. 

&quot;Hotaru-chan? Are you alright?&quot; Chibi-Usa gave the taller girl another 
hug. 

Hotaru looked down at her dearest friend and smiled reassuringly. &quot;I&#39;m 
fine, Chibi-Usa-chan.&quot; She looked around the room and included 
everyone in it. &quot;I&#39;m fine, really.&quot; Haruka watched her for signs of an 
injury, but Hotaru moved smoothly into the room, seating herself 
between Usagi and Chibi-Usa. Usagi took one of her hands and gave it a 
quick squeeze. Hotaru smiled at her, blushing a little at all the 
attention focused on her. 

&quot;Hotaru...&quot; Usagi began, but Haruka stepped forward and stopped her 
with one hand lightly on her shoulder. 

Setsuna nodded at Haruka and turned to the younger women. &quot;We&#39;ve told 
you all we know, and what we have conjectured. Now, I&#39;m sorry Hotaru,&quot; 
she turned towards her daughter, her eyes sad and worried, &quot;we have to 
know what&#39;s going on. Do you know anything? Can we do anything to stop 
this?&quot; Her eyes fixed on Usagi, whose jaw was tightening. &quot;I can only 
speak for myself, Princess, when I say that I will gladly sacrifice my 
life, if that&#39;s what it would take to save Hotaru.&quot; 

&quot;No!&quot; Hotaru jumped up from her seat, hands clenched. &quot;No! That&#39;s the 
entire point! You&#39;d ruin everything!&quot; Mamoru reached out a hand, but 
Hotaru shook him off. 

Usagi stood and faced Hotaru. &quot;Hotaru-chan, what do you mean, we&#39;d 
&#39;ruin everything?&#39; You have to tell us what&#39;s going on.&quot; She took one 
of Hotaru&#39;s clenched fists in her hand, her eyes dark with concern. 

Hotaru shook her arm violently, but Usagi kept her grip firm. Hotaru&#39;s 
face began to change, to become darker, cruder and her eyes took on a 
feral look. She snarled and threw out an arm, aiming at Usagi&#39;s face. 
The slap never landed. Haruka had jumped the couch as soon as she saw 
Hotaru coil. Her hand intercepted the blow, turning it away from her 
Princess and trapping the arm. She grabbed Hotaru firmly and shook 
her, calling her name. 

&quot;Hotaru-chan!&quot; Haruka gripped her shoulders and tried to connect with 
the girl&#39;s eyes. &quot;Hotaru, come back!&quot; 

She could feel tension build under her hands. Hotaru gave herself a 
great shake and then looked up at Haruka, surprise registering just 
before pain. &quot;Oh my God!&quot; she cried and threw her face into her hands. 

Haruka shifted her grip and drew the girl into her body, clutching her 
in a tight, supportive embrace. Hotaru sobbed like the child she truly 
was, and pressed her face into Haruka&#39;s chest. She could hear Hotaru 
speaking quietly in between sobs. 

&quot;Not again, please.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice was weak, defeated. 

Haruka sat the girl down and made her drink some tea. Hotaru stared 
blindly into the cup, tears mingling freely with the dark liquid. 

Haruka&#39;s voice was soft when she took Hotaru&#39;s face in her hands and 
looked into the large violet eyes that stared up at her. &quot;Hotaru, do 
you know who, or what it is? Can we stop this? Please, please trust 
us, we are your family.&quot; 

Usagi stood by Haruka&#39;s side, nodding. &quot;Hotaru-chan, you don&#39;t have to 
bear this alone.&quot; 

Hotaru heaved a sigh and smiled wanly up at them. &quot;I am sorry for 
upsetting you all. I feel sometimes,&quot; she tried to speak lightly, 
&quot;that so many different entities have lived inside me that I&#39;m a kind 
of cosmic hotel.&quot; Her voice cracked on the last word, and her eyes 
dropped. Haruka let go of her face, but kept one hand on the girl. 
Hotaru reached out for a hand and Haruka clasped it firmly. She might 
not be able to stop the pain, but she would do anything she had to 
protect this girl, her fellow Senshi, her daughter. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka watched as Hotaru fought off a new blackness or a memory, she 
thought, of an old one. The girl looked up a the concerned faces 
around her and tightened her lips. &quot;I owe you all an apology. Several, 
I believe.&quot; She waved her free hand at the protestations that were 
spoken. Setsuna-mama,&quot; her voice was grim, but she used the name as 
easily as she always did, &quot;Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama, I owe you 
especially. I know this has been hard on you. And I&#39;m not entirely 
sure I can give you good news.&quot; 

She smiled tightly at Haruka and let go of her hand. Haruka was aware 
of feeling that something important had been taken away and she 
clenched the hand that had held Hotaru&#39;s. She stepped back and took 
Michiru&#39;s hand as soon as she could, to fill the odd void. 

Hotaru held her hands together in her lap and spoke down to the floor. 
&quot;A long time ago, before many of you had even come into being, Saturn 
made a promise to someone. She would give up her own life energy to 
feed the entity, on one condition. That day, Sailor Saturn ceased 
being a Senshi of destruction, and she,... I, became a Senshi of death 
and rebirth. When Sailor Saturn uses, when I use my power, my life 
force is lessened by an equal amount. The entity uses it to survive. 
When Mistress 9 invaded my body her power contributed and I did not 
age perceptibly. Now... now the entity,&quot; she looked up at Setsuna and 
spoke hesitantly, &quot;now Eternity wants more. Not only my life force, 
but yours as well. By not telling you of this ancient promise, I&#39;m so 
sorry, Haruka-papa, Michiru-mama!&quot; Her voice broke and new tears fell 
down her face. &quot;I almost killed you!&quot; 

Haruka felt Michiru&#39;s hand grip her own. Both of them moved forward to 
comfort the wretched girl. For a long time no one spoke. Haruka could 
see the tight faces around her, intense with concentration. 

Haruka opened her mouth to speak, but Setsuna&#39;s soft voice came from 
the settee. 

&quot;Hotaru. I think its time we paid a visit to Eternity, don&#39;t you?&quot; 

Haruka looked at Usagi, who looked ready to leave immediately, and 
Mamoru, who nodded at her. 

Haruka acknowledged her Prince and spoke evenly. &quot;My job is to protect 
the Earth. This Eternity is a threat to my planet, to my Prince and 
Princess and most of all to you, Hotaru-chan. Even if this was long 
ago, I, we, would owe this to you as Senshi. But its not long ago, is 
it?&quot; Her voice became gentle. 

Michiru, who had remained silent the entire time spoke now. &quot;For 
Setsuna, Haruka and myself, I know I can say that, Hotaru-chan, we 
love you like a daughter - and like parents, we will fight to the 
death to protect you. As Sailor Neptune I can say that we four will 
not be fighting alone.&quot; There was a sharp burst of agreement from the 
younger Senshi. 

Haruka looked around her. She could see the grim determination on 
their faces and was pleased. She knew that they&#39;d be able to face 
whatever threat Eternity posed. And she knew that Eternity, whatever 
it was, would never be the same again, when they had got done with it. 

Mamoru&#39;s voice was firm when he spoke. He also has a daughter, Haruka 
thought as she watched him, and he knows exactly how we are feeling. 

&quot;What we need, is to understand what Eternity is, and where to find 
it. Hotaru-chan,&quot; he asked the girl. &quot;Are you up to this?&quot; 

She looked him in the eye. &quot;Yes. I have to be.&quot; 

He held her gaze for a moment longer, then smiled softly. &quot;Then let&#39;s 
begin at the beginning.&quot;
