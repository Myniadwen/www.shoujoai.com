<h1>I'll Protect You (part 16 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Are you the one who wrote the song &#39;Useless&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yes, why did you ask?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Can you tell me what the song is about?&quot;

&quot;Well, the song is actually about a friend of mine back in London. She 
asked me to write a song for her and her boyfriend. It turned out really 
good so I asked her permission to include it in my album. So that&#39;s it&quot; 
Minako explained

Rei looked unsatisfied

&quot;Tha-that&#39;s it?&quot; She asked with disappointment

&quot;What do you mean &#39;That&#39;s it&#39;?&quot;

&quot;I mean, is there a reason why your friend asked you to write the song 
besides love or a gift?&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan, you&#39;re getting paranoid again. I assure you that is all. 
Isn&#39;t it too obvious that a person asked me to write the song because 
she wanted to please her lover?&quot;

&quot;But she can write it herself, right? I guess her lover would rather 
like that&quot;

Minako frowned a bit

&quot;Why the sudden face? Did I say something wrong?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;She&#39;s-she&#39;s blind Rei-chan&quot; Minako weakly said

Rei went silent

&quot;Oh, sorry. I reacted rudely&quot; She said suddenly

&quot;It&#39;s alright. At least you didn&#39;t say &#39;I didn&#39;t know&#39;. That&#39;s what all 
I hear when my other friends asked me about that song. It&#39;s like if they 
only knew at the first place they would not say that&quot; Minako said, her 
smile back again

Rei sighed. &#39;I know should not give up on this. But I&#39;ll just give up on 
the subject. I&#39;ve already talked to them anyway. Now all I have to do is 
the most difficult part: Decision&#39;

Rei noticed her pop star lover yawned secretly while she was in deep 
thought

&quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re tired and sleepy. I noticed just now&quot; Rei 
commented

Minako stopped yawning half way to closing her mouth, surprised Rei 
noticed although she was facing away

&quot;Argh, I don&#39;t want to sleep yet! But this stupid body of mine is 
contrasting my mind!&quot; Minako pouted as she lean on Rei&#39;s shoulder. Then 
Rei lean her own head to her lover&#39;s

&quot;Heh-heh, I guess I bored you. I&#39;m really a boring person. I don&#39;t 
really know what it is that you see in me&quot;

Minako lifted her head slightly to kiss her lover&#39;s neck gently then 
leaned again on Rei&#39;s shoulder

&quot;What a noisy and an outgoing person like me needed is a silent, 
serious, passionate, mysterious, unintentionally funny, sexy, gorgeous 
woman like you and only you. That&#39;s what I saw that I loved from you&quot; 
Minako said

&quot;Unintentionally...funny?&quot;

&quot;It means you accidentally do funny stuff without even knowing or being 
aware of it&quot;

&quot;I did?&quot;

&quot;Hahaha, you sure are boring Rei-chan! But that really entertained me&quot; 
Minako said earning a pinch on the cheek from her lover. She reached for 
her camera phone and focused the lens to them

&quot;What is that for?&quot; Rei asked

Minako clicked the flash and a picture of them was taken

&quot;I didn&#39;t have a picture of us in my phone, here kiss me&quot; Minako said as 
she refocuses her camera phone lens to them

Rei smiled and kissed Minako cutely. The pop star successfully captured 
the picture and save it to her cell phone. She saw the picture of Rei 
sleeping; she had taken it the first day they met. It has a caption 
&#39;Girl Hunk!&#39;

Minako laughed a bit

&quot;Why are you laughing? Did it turn out bad?&quot; Rei asked

Minako once again focused the camera phone and kissed her lover again, 
this time a lot more passionate than the last kiss

-Click!-

&quot;Rei-chan lock the door&quot; Minako commanded her lover

Rei obeyed instantly and stood up and walked towards the door. But the 
door was already locked so she went back to where her pop star lover is

&quot;I&#39;m here in the bedroom Rei-chan&quot; Called Minako

Rei followed the direction of her pop star lover&#39;s voice

&quot;That&#39;s my girl. Go to sleep already, it&#39;s two in the morning already. 
I&#39;ll be sleeping here at the couch&quot; Rei said as she sits at the couch 
where she slept the first day she met Minako

&quot;I want you to sleep here with me, that&#39;s why I asked you to lock the 
door. Don&#39;t worry I&#39;ll wake you up before everyone storms inside here 
when sun comes up&quot; Minako said

&quot;I wanted to sleep with you, really. It&#39;s just that I don&#39;t have any 
spare clothes-&quot;

&quot;Oh, Rei. You know I&#39;ll never let any of your excuses slip through me, 
get change now, and look for some clothes you want at my trolley&quot;

&quot;Geez, pop star clothes?&quot; Rei said lazily

&quot;That&#39;s all I&#39;ve got. Now get moving&quot;

Rei went in to the bathroom. Her mind is thirty percent happy that she 
is here with Minako and seventy percent troubled with what awaits them. 
She took the short opportunity to think of what happened between her and 
the men called Sanctuary. This way, Minako is not around to notice her 
thinking deeply again

--FLASHBACK- (I&#39;m not kidding)

-At the abandoned place-

&quot;...Minako&#39;s life...is at sake here right?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;Uh-huh&quot; The first voice replied

&quot;...and because you want me to join Sanctuary...You&#39;ll...so the 
condition is...If I joined Sanctuary, Minako will be spared?&quot; Rei asked 
with disbelief

&quot;Straight to the point bright girl...But if you don&#39;t...&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart is slowly sinking

&quot;You&#39;ll...kill her...and many other people&quot;

&quot;Right again. And even if you call out all the bomb specialists and rent 
as many highly skilled canines as you can there, those will only be 
useless. There are so many ways to kill Hino-chan, and you also know 
that&quot;

&quot;Why do want me to join Sanctuary? Of all the people on earth? I&#39;m a 
police and your enemy right?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;Exactly. That&#39;s the reason. You are a police. We believe that there is 
something only you can do as a police and as Hino Rei. You look weak and 
timid in the eyes of the public but what resides inside your heart is an 
indestructible fire that burns everyone into dust if they tried to stand 
in your way. And besides, we might get an idea on how policemen behaves 
and thinks from you&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not all am I right?&quot;

&quot;Yes that&#39;s not all. We need your knowledge in riddle solving and crime 
scene investigation. We want your help in investigating something at 
London. We promise not any sorts of crimes will be done by you. Leave 
the dirty work to us&quot; Said the gentle voiced man

&quot;You are taking me away to London?&quot; Rei asked in disbelief

There was short silence. This silence only means &#39;Yes&#39;

&quot;So that&#39;s all. Do I get to come back here when I&#39;m finished?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t be happening&quot;

Rei winced. A fully permanent member of Sanctuary?

&quot;Sacrifices are necessary. Especially when you join us&quot;

&quot;But...this is crazy! I can&#39;t sacrifice Minako or my job with the people 
around me!&quot; Rei yelled

&quot;You have to decide. If you refuse, many will die including the pop 
star. If you agree no one will be hurt, mark our words&quot; A man speak

&quot;Oh, did I mention I have another ability other than to hypnotize and 
control anyone&#39;s body?&quot; The man in front said to heighten Rei&#39;s tension

Rei clenched her fist and greeted her teeth. Her sweat is trailing down 
her neck

&quot;Don&#39;t you want to be with Minako...always?&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll be seeing you tomorrow. Don&#39;t bother to find us for we will find 
you&quot; The gentle voiced man said as he follows the other two men who were 
walking and about to leave. He took a feather out of his coat pocket and 
wiped it gently on his face

&quot;Hehehe. I know you do, so think of it carefully&quot; The man in Rei&#39;s front 
finally said and followed the rest of his companions. They disappeared 
right away before Rei can imagine

-END OF FLASHBACK-

Rei sighed and looked at herself at the bathroom mirror. Her eyes looked 
heavy, and then she leans against it. She is really happy that Minako is 
with her tonight, yet her personal problems kept her mind flying away 
from nowhere

&#39;Why is this happening to me? These lies...I know they will result to no 
good but why do I keep lying to myself and to her?&#39;

Rei once again looked at the mirror. Her mood turned from self blame to 
self anger. She hated her self for being Rei Hino, but liked a small 
part of herself because of Minako. She walked out of the bathroom to 
rejoin her pop star lover

Minako is waiting impatiently on her bed, crossed arm while forcefully 
singing softly to herself to keep her awake. Rei observed her silently. 
Minako&#39;s eyes are now slowly closing then quickly opening when she 
realized she almost sleeps unnoticed. To Rei&#39;s amusement, Minako&#39;s 
fingers held her eyes open, muttering &#39;I won&#39;t sleep!&#39; several times

Rei laughed, her noise made Minako jump and stop from what she&#39;s doing 
and blushed

&quot;That&#39;s a nice way of a pop star to keep herself awake&quot; Rei commented

&quot;I never do this! Just now that I am having a great difficulty to remain 
awake. By the way, you look like a goddess in my night gown, good 
choice!&quot; Minako winked, this time it&#39;s Rei&#39;s turn to blush. She is 
wearing a bright red and really short night gown, she didn&#39;t have any 
other choice since the rest of Minako&#39;s night gowns were a lot shorter 
than what she is wearing. Minako wore an orange one

Minako moved to give her lover a space on the bed. Rei slowly joined 
Minako, and they hugged and cuddled for a minute. After that they kissed 
each other and sleep peacefully

-Sun Rises Up-

Minako&#39;s staff went into a little last minute shopping for some 
additional accessories, clothes and make-ups while Minako, Rei and Wendy 
are back once again at the theatre for final rehearsal and evaluation of 
the concert director.

The head chief added five times the number of his men on the theatre. As 
Rei expected, the head chief rented canine and bomb experts. They have 
talked earlier morning. All Rei said to the head chief is to triple 
alert his men. The head chief wanted to talk to her niece about what 
happened between her and Minako last night but was busy to squeeze the 
subject. Minako and Wendy are discussing about something with the 
concert director and the other staff in the stage. Rei is standing alone 
near the curtain entrance of the back stage where she has a full view of 
Minako and the rest

Then suddenly a voice behind a curtain whispered to her

&quot;I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re all alone now Rei-san-don&#39;t look back, pretend 
you&#39;re not talking to someone&quot; A gentle voice whispered on her back

&quot;What the hell are you doing here? There are police in the back stage 
too!&quot; Rei hissed, pretending to look at Minako&#39;s direction while 
muttering on the person she&#39;s talking to behind her back

&quot;Jason has taken care of them. I&#39;m here to accept the message from you. 
Your decision&quot; He whispered

Rei felt the blood from her whole body drained. So this is it?

Rei is silent. Can she be making the right decision? But if she denied 
the invitation, it&#39;s a much worse scenario for sure

&quot;I see it&#39;s making you miserable. But your answer is supposed to be very 
obvious right? All I need from you is only a yes or a no&quot; He whispered 
again

Rei cursed in her thought. Why do they need her that bad enough to kill 
many people?

&quot;Rei-san&quot; he called again

The body guard clenched her fist and deeply breathes

&quot;Yes&quot; Rei finally whispered

&quot;Come again?&quot; He asked

&quot;I said &#39;Yes&#39;&quot; Rei whispered weaker than the first one, her teeth 
gritting

The man whispering behind her was silent for a while. Then he whispered 
again

&quot;Thank you for confirming it. Our task for today is done. See you 
tomorrow after the concert. Again, seek us not because we&#39;ll find you, 
even if you escape. I know you wouldn&#39;t dare that. Good day&quot;

Rei started to walk slowly, more of a death walk

&quot;Oh, Rei-san&quot; The voice called again

Rei paused from walking

&quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;Welcome to Sanctuary&quot;
