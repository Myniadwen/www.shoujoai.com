<h1>Someday Out of the Blue (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sumdayblu-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Makoto turned this way and that in front of the mirror, trying to 
examine herself from every angle possible. Each presented a stunning 
view of her flawless physique. The black knee length strapless dress 
she wore, hugged her in all the right places, and along with her 
pinned up hair revealed rich creamy skin. Makoto debated on the high 
heels, but donned a pair realizing they made her legs howl sexy.

Giving herself the once-over for the fourth time, Makoto referred to 
her mental checklist. She smiled with satisfaction as she liked what 
she saw, but a hint of guilty clouded her smile. &#145;I never tired this 
hard to look good for Koan.&#39;

Makoto didn&#39;t get to dwell on it further when a knock at the door 
interrupted her thoughts. Glancing at the clock she brightened, 7pm, 
&#145;the ever punctual Ami.&#39; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Makoto had noticed the changes in Ami since their first meeting in the 
elevator, but now spending the evening with Ami allowed her to see 
more of what the past eighteen years had done. It seems Ami had 
developed more social courage. The shyness that kept her from 
expressing herself in her early years had dissipated, probably not 
completely, but it wasn&#39;t as apparent as it used to be. Makoto grinned 
as she remembered being the only one who knew all sides of Ami, and 
was glad that Ami finally found the courage, or became comfortable 
enough, to let some sides show. 

Dinner went by pleasantly the two spent it catching up on the general 
specifics of their lives apart. She had hoped that their conversations 
would lead to her finding out who little Mako&#39;s father is, but Ami 
never let on and Makoto knew not to ask. 

After dinner the two went for a walk in the vast hotel gardens. As 
they walked Ami told her of the new life she was making in Japan, the 
new job she moved back for, the medical conference being kept at the 
hotel that would introduce her to the notables in the Japanese medical 
world. She even voiced her fears of becoming a workaholic like her 
mother. Makoto&#39;s heart went out to her as Ami went on about how much 
she wanted to be a part of her daughters life. 

Makoto weighed out how much she should share with Ami. Not that she 
wanted to lie, there were just things that didn&#39;t want to bring up, 
like the specifics about the recent state of her marriage. Obviously 
Ami had the same thought. She ended up telling Ami about her 
businesses and mentioned her divorce like she was commenting on the 
weather.

&quot;Divorce?&quot; Ami said a bit surprised. She stopped and sat on a bench 
some distance away from a small man made pond, &quot;how long?&quot; Makoto sat 
next to her a took a calming breath, &quot;hmm...negative a few months.&quot;

Again Ami looked surprised and stared at her, &quot;what?&quot;

&quot;well honestly, I don&#39;t even know if he knows about the divorce yet.&quot; 

Ami let out a low chuckle and turned to admire how beautiful the 
moonlight looked on the pond, &quot;I see.&quot;

Makoto felt sheepish and lapsed into silence, pretending to admire the 
same pond, but in reality in addition to keeping very good tabs on 
Ami&#39;s movements, she was mentally beaten herself up.

A moment later Ami sharply turned to her and quietly studied her. 
Makoto wordless watched her in turn, trying to figure out what was 
going through her mind. Though Ami didn&#39;t let her wonder long, &quot;wasn&#39;t 
worth fighting for huh?&quot;

Makoto knew Ami wasn&#39;t asking about her doomed marriage. She watched 
uneasily as Ami&#39;s eyes began to reflect those emotions she had riled 
in them the last night they were together eighteen years ago, and knew 
Ami was reliving it in her mind. 

Makoto contemplated the difference between Ami face and her eyes. She 
watched her fixed calm visage, then catalogued the emotions in those 
stormy eyes. Her mind didn&#39;t know what to think as she recognized 
love, but her heart swelled. It was still there. This time along with 
self loathing, the love she saw there brought her hope, she had a 
chance with Ami. How big or small she didn&#39;t know, but it was a 
chance. A chance she had no idea how to utilize.

&quot;Makoto?!&quot;

Makoto gave herself a mental shake and concentrated on Ami, &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry.&quot; With a quick glance around she turned back to Ami, &quot;was just 
thinking.&quot;

&quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that it wasn&#39;t worth fighting for. I just didn&#39;t want to 
hold you back. Didn&#39;t want to be the source of all your regrets.&quot; She 
solemnly peered into Ami&#39;s eyes pleading with her to understand. 
&quot;Believe me Ami, I was the last person that wanted you to go, but I 
was also the first person that believed you had to go. You wanted it 
and you deserved it....&quot;

&quot;I wanted you!&quot;

It wasn&#39;t screamed, or seethed in anger, but said firmly and based 
with hurt. Those words and there tone broke Makoto&#39;s heart and shamed 
her into silence. She couldn&#39;t look at Ami anymore and sat with her 
back against the bench. 

&quot;I left Japan devastated you know,&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was quiet and firm, 
the hurt had left it, but it still tore Makoto apart inside.

&quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll ever understand Ami.&quot; she whispered.

&quot;No, I understand.&quot; That&#39;s when Makoto looked at her fully intrigued, 
and Ami began again.

&quot;I left devastated, for weeks I thought I had done something for you 
to have said what you did.&quot; Ami stopped and studied Makoto for a few 
seconds before going on, &quot;I thought you loved me....&quot;

&quot;I did...&quot; Ami quickly cut her off by placing her fingers to Makoto&#39;s 
lips. 

&quot;I know.&quot; She slowly ran her thumb over them before taking her hand 
away. Makoto only swallowed.

&quot;I couldn&#39;t completely convince myself that you didn&#39;t, that&#39;s when it 
occurred to me that you probably just said it to get me on the plane 
and keep me in the U.S.&quot; 

Makoto smiled grimly, &quot;it worked.&quot; Then something occurred to Makoto, 
&quot;if you knew why I did it why didn&#39;t you call me, write, get in 
touch.&quot;

Ami was noticeably surprised, &quot;what am I hearing?&quot; she gave a short 
chuckle. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t I be the angry one, I&#39;m the one that got dumped.&quot;
That shut Makoto up. &quot;Besides,&quot; Ami began as she sobered &quot;I distinctly 
remembered someone not wanting a long distance relationship.&quot; 

Makoto colored, &quot;I see.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the one that kept me away, why I didn&#39;t visit or write...I 
couldn&#39;t explain it away.&quot; 

Ami looked at Makoto and sighed, &quot;and I don&#39;t really want an 
explanation anymore.&quot; 

Makoto took that as cue that the hope she saw earlier was long gone, 
apparently Ami had moved on. It has been eighteen years, she herself 
did get married. &#145;But I wasn&#39;t over you I just ignored my feeling for 
you.&quot;

Makoto was snatched from her thoughts as her mind registered warm lips 
pushing against hers. She froze as her mind fed her more details. Who: 
They were Ami&#39;s lips. Why: ? Who cares. Just as Ami was about to pull 
away, Makoto began to respond bring Ami&#39;s lips back to hers. Both 
women moaned, and pulled each other closer as their tongues rejoiced 
in what was deprived from them for almost two decades. 

when they parted both were out of breath and quite aroused, and one a 
bit confused. Ami used her right hand to cup Makoto&#39;s face and caress 
her lips again. 

&quot;All I want to know,&quot; Ami whispered intently peering into Makoto&#39;s 
eyes, &quot;is what do you want right now?&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t believe her ears, there was only one answer to that 
question. She took Ami&#39;s hand and kissed the palm before pulling the 
smaller woman into her arms.

&quot;You.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

The next morning Makoto woke up with her face cradled by a mass of 
something soft and blue. She sighed with satisfaction and wrapped her 
arms around the warm naked body that lay in front of her as the faint 
smell of Ami&#39;s shampoo invaded her senses. She thanked the gods as she 
reveled in the feel of the other woman and memories of their night 
together flooded her mind. Makoto licked Ami&#39;s left earlobe as she 
remembered that there wasn&#39;t a second of last night that she would 
ever forget. 

Ami gave a sensual moan as she woke cocooned in the warmth of a smooth 
muscular embrace. She was about to turned to her lover when her eyes 
caught the time. 

&quot;Damn it!&quot;

She bolted out of bed, no shame anywhere on her, and proceeded to 
stumble into her clothing. What she could find of it at least. 

Makoto didn&#39;t know what to say. The woman she just spent hours making 
intense mind-blowing love with just jumped out of her bed swearing. 
&#145;What a way to hurt a girl&#39;. Makoto just stared as Ami made her way 
around the room trying to put on everything she needed to look decent. 

Ami was almost at the door when she stopped and made a B-line for 
Makoto. After dropping a single kiss on her lips she made her way to 
the door calling &quot;I&#39;ll see you later, have a date with a younger 
Makoto to get to.&quot;

When the door closed Makoto snuggled under the covers only to grin 
profusely when she found Ami&#39;s panties in there with her.
