<h1>No Time for Love (part 3 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Setsuna felt a violent stab, not unlike the one she had felt when she&#39;d 
first walked away from Kira, shoot through her heart as the three women 
vanished. She ached deep inside and she could almost swear her cheek was 
burning where Kira had touched her. Hearing deep groans she looked to 
her side where the others were straining against there invisible bonds. 
She knew that they would wear off now that Kira wasn&#39;t in the room and 
contented herself to just sit. Sure enough, a minute or so later she felt 
the hold release and everyone sprang to their feet. Makoto, Minako, and 
Usagi all grabbed their wands and ran outside to see if they could find 
the others and Haruka and Michiru gave Hotaru comforting hugs. The three 
of them were staring at her and she sighed.

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka&#39;s jaw dropped when Setsuna asked her so calmly but it 
was Michiru who spoke.

&quot;Setsuna-san, who was that?&quot; Setsuna rolled her shoulders, took a deep 
breath, and looked back at the spot where they had stood not five 
minutes ago. She didn&#39;t get a chance to answer because Makoto, Minako, 
and Usagi, now in sailor form, came running back through the door.

&quot;We couldn&#39;t find them. We couldn&#39;t even sense them. Where&#39;d they go?&quot; 
Makoto demanded and Setsuna resisted the urge to sigh again.

&quot;I doubt you&#39;ll be able to find them.&quot; Makoto almost growled but Usagi 
laid a hand on her arm.

&quot;Why not Setsuna-san? What happened? Who was that girl?&quot; Setsuna gave a 
weak smile.

&quot;Sit down. I&#39;ll tell you everything.&quot;

&quot;I just want to know where there are. The longer we wait the further 
away they get and the bigger the chance she might hurt Ami or Rei.&quot; 
Minako nodded and Setsuna shook her head.

&quot;Wherever they were going, they&#39;re there already. Vampires have the 
ability for instantaneous travel. And she won&#39;t hurt them. She could 
never hurt anyone.&quot;

&quot;What makes you so sure, and how do you know so much about her?&quot;

&quot;Sit down Makoto-san. I promise I&#39;ll tell you. And until you hear 
everything, you&#39;ll just have to take my word that she won&#39;t hurt them.&quot; 
Still growling a little, Makoto detransformed and sat as did Minako and 
Usagi. Haruka and Michiru sat with Hotaru between them and Setsuna took 
a breath.

&quot;Demons of many kinds, including vampires have been alive as long as 
their has been good in this world. They were alive and lived on Earth, 
even during the time of the Millennium Kingdom. Queen Serenity allowed 
them to live as she couldn&#39;t bring herself to kill them. Not all demons 
had chosen that life and it would have been unfair. But only those who 
were not evil and behaved were allowed to stay. The rest were banished 
to the Negaverse. Those who were left had to follow the Queen&#39;s rules. 
That meant that they couldn&#39;t drink from children or take them.&quot;

&quot;Take them?&quot; Usagi echoed and Setsuna gave her a pointed look.&quot; Ohhh.&quot; 
She said once the meaning had set in and Haruka and Michiru hugged 
Hotaru tighter.

&quot;Also, no demon could kill anyone. And vampires, because of their 
special powers weren&#39;t allowed to use them to bed anyone against their 
will, or drink from anyone who didn&#39;t volunteer. About five years before 
the fall, the Rei-chan of that time had approached me and um...&quot; Setsuna 
sighed and couldn&#39;t help the small blush that sprang to her cheeks. 
Praying the Rei and Ami wouldn&#39;t be all too embarrassed she sighed for 
what seemed like the umpteenth time and continued. &quot;She professed her 
love. For me. I knew I wasn&#39;t her soul mate and had to turn her down. I 
couldn&#39;t tell her who she belonged with though and it hurt her of 
course. Gods that was horrible.&quot; Setsuna allowed the memory to surface 
in the back of her mind, even as she kept talking.

****** &quot;But Setsuna-san, can&#39;t you at least tell me why you won&#39;t even 
consider me? Please?!&quot; Rei whimpered as more tears ran down her face. 
Fearful of giving away too much, Setsuna just sighed to herself and laid 
a hand on her shoulder.

&quot;I cannot say much more of this matter Rei-chan. I can only say that I 
am not meant for you.&quot; 

&quot;Am I ever going to have anyone or am I always going to be alone? Please 
tell me Setsuna-san! You can&#39;t just turn me away!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Rei-chan. I truly am.&quot; ******

&quot;Then, two years later, Ami-chan came to me with the same issue. Again, 
I knew I wasn&#39;t her soulmate and had to turn her away. At the time, they 
both had a sort of crush on their soulmates but they were paid no mind. 
To them, it seemed as if they were doomed to be alone and I hated 
hurting them so.&quot; Again, Setsuna allowed herself to relive the moment 
while continuing with the story.

****** &quot;We have so much in common Setsuna-san. I can understand the 
advanced thinking you study better than most people, and better than all 
of the senshi. We&#39;re both nearly immortal. I think we would be good 
together Setsuna-san, don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, we would Ami-chan, but I am not meant for you.&quot;

&quot;Is anyone meant for me Setsuna-chan? I&#39;m not exactly fought over. Am I 
supposed to be alone for my life, is that why you turn me away?&quot; She 
sniffled and Setsuna winced. Women crying was not something anyone 
wanted to deal with.

&quot;I cannot say that Ami-chan. You know I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I know Setsuna-san. I just..., I wish it could be you.&quot;

&quot;I do too Ami-chan.&quot; ****** 

&quot;But even more so, I hated turning them away. I knew they would be with 
someone eventually but who could be there for the Senshi of time?&quot;

&quot;Is who they had the crush on then the same people they are in love 
with now?&quot; Usagi piped up and Setsuna smiled at her.

&quot;I shouldn&#39;t tell you that. I&#39;m probably saying too much now but it&#39;s 
necessary. Anyway, I was feeling quite depressed and decided to go to 
Earth to take my mind off things. Being the senshi of time did have its 
advantages and I easily jumped around so that I was covering my post but 
could still go to Earth. I pretended to be a human because I knew not 
everyone liked the Queen or her protectors and that&#39;s when I met her. 
When I met Kira-ch...san.&quot; Setsuna whimpered a bit in the back of her 
throat and swallowed tears.&quot;I was at a bar in down-town Tokyo when she 
came up to me. She was so beautiful, I fell for her instantly. I kept 
coming back to that same place to meet her, and after a few months we 
started to make real dates. I was slacking off a bit on my duties but I 
felt like finally I&#39;d found someone. Of course I thought it wouldn&#39;t 
last. I was an immortal and I didn&#39;t know she was a vampire. I didn&#39;t 
tell her who I was either. I didn&#39;t want her to know. I wanted to be 
liked for who I was, for the woman I was. Not for the glamour of the 
senshi that I am. We were together for almost 8 months when I came to one 
of our dates early. I caught her drinking from one of the girls who hung 
around her a lot and it scared me a little.&quot; Setsuna smiled a bit 
remembering that night. It was quite hard for people to startle her 
being the Senshi of time and all, so it had been interesting to say the 
least when she could&#39;ve sworn her heart stopped.

****** &quot;Kira-chan? Kira-chan are you here?&quot; Setsuna sighed and put her 
hands on her hips. She wasn&#39;t that early. Why wouldn&#39;t Kira be at home? 
A small noise got her attention and she turned hesitantly toward the 
back room. The noise was soft, almost like a whimper, and Setsuna 
instinctively grabbed her henshin wand. Walking softly toward the back 
room she stood just outside the slightly open door. Gingerly she peaked 
around the corner and almost whimpered herself. Kira had her arms around 
Hitomi, one of the girls that frequented the bar she and Kira usually 
met at, and looked to be kissing her neck. Hitomi looked absolutely 
spaced and Setsuna felt her heart squeeze. Not one to put things off she 
took a deep breath and barged through the door. 

&quot;Kira-chan what are you doing?!&quot; Kira who had been facing the door at 
that time, ripped her head from Hitomi&#39;s neck and scared Setsuna half to 
death when her fangs gleamed dripping with fresh blood. For a half 
second Setsuna was almost sure a demon had taken over Kira, which did 
happen on Earth sometimes, until Kira gave her a half sheepish, half 
deer in the headlights grin.

&quot;Um, hi Setsuna-chan. Uh, you&#39;re here early. Hehe...&quot;

******

Setsuna shook her head wondering how exactly Kira had managed to look 
sheepish and deamonish at the same time. Realizing that she&#39;d wandered 
into what Hotaru would call &#39;Never never land&#39; she shook her head and 
kept talking. &quot;Anyway, she told me then, who she was, and being a senshi 
I was okay with it. I&#39;d certainly seen worse than vampires in my day. I 
knew she wasn&#39;t evil, I&#39;d would have been able to feel it if she was. 
She was thrilled that I was okay with it but then I realized that if she 
was immortal she&#39;d eventually start to wonder why I wasn&#39;t aging. I made 
up my mind to tell her. I was already so in love with her, I didn&#39;t give 
a damn about the law.&quot;

&quot;What law Setsuna-san?&quot; Minako asked and Setsuna took the opportunity 
to take another calming breath.

&quot;There was a law that Queen Serenity had. It was one of the highest 
ones there was for the senshi to follow. No senshi was allowed to be with 
a demon. I don&#39;t know why, but it was very strict. But I ignored it. 
Until the problems with the Negaverse started. I knew I had to start 
really being alert but I hadn&#39;t told Kira-san yet. When the problems 
started to really get serious I knew I had to choose. The Queen needed 
all of us and I was betraying her by being with Kira-san. So, I told her 
that I just couldn&#39;t handle being with her knowing that we wouldn&#39;t grow 
old and die together. I said that I needed to be with someone I knew 
wouldn&#39;t outlive me by hundreds of years, and I left her. It was only a 
month or so after that that the battle with the Negaverse began. I 
haven&#39;t seen her since, until just now.&quot; Setsuna had tears in her eyes 
and Usagi was quick to offer a tissue. No one said anything for a few 
moments and Setsuna used the time to compose herself.

&quot;I don&#39;t mean to be rude, I but I still want to rescue Ami-chan and 
Rei-chan.&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;You can try to find them, but Kira-san is over a thousand years old. 
If she doesn&#39;t want to be found, she won&#39;t be. Besides, after a while, 
Ami-chan and Rei-chan may not want to leave.&quot;

&quot;What? Why not?&quot; Minako asked and Setsuna stared her in the eye.

&quot;Have you ever experienced unrequited love Minako-san? Not a crush, but 
honest love?&quot; Minako shook her head. &quot;The pain of unrequited love can be 
unbearable. Some would describe it as a worse fate than death. Kira-san 
could ease Ami-chan and Rei-chan&#39;s pain with her vampire charms. She 
could give them peace, and that may not be something they want to walk 
away from. If it takes us to long too find them, they may just decide to 
stay there.&quot; Makoto leapt to her feet.

&quot;That&#39;s all the more reason for us to leave right away!&quot; She cried. 
Setsuna just leaned back into the couch, crossing her arms.

&quot;And where exactly would you like to start looking?&quot; She asked 
pointedly and the dumfounded stares across the room made Setsuna close 
her eyes. *Oh Kira-chan, it&#39;s good to see you again, but why in 
Kami-sama&#39;s name did you have to come back?*</pre>
