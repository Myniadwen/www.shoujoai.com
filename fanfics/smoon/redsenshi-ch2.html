<h1>Red Senshi Diaries (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ajones.html">Adam Jones</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/redsenshi-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Fortunately for me, nobody was around when I finally got home - which was a 
stroke of luck in itself, because I certainly hadn&#39;t been thinking about where I 
was going... 

I shut the door gratefully, my whole body feeling hot and tired, my skin 
tingling. (I think somebody must have left the heating on - I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not 
usually that warm in our house.) 

An effort of will saw me safely up the stairs and into the bathroom for a quick 
shower, which soon became a long shower, which... well, ended up as a very long 
shower indeed. (On reflection, perhaps I should&#39;ve used cold water...) 

Anyway, I eventually emerged, feeling much more human and a whole lot more 
awake. I dumped my old clothes in the wash and put on a light cotton sundress, 
before ransacking the kitchen in the name of breakfast. There was a message from 
Rei-chan on the answerphone, inviting me over for a meeting that I was probably 
already late for. Oh, the stressful life of a superheroine... 

------------------------------------------------------------------

As ever, I made it to the temple at an almost record-breaking pace, nearly 
slamming into Mina and Mako-chan halfway up the stairs. 

Makoto gave me a sly smile. &quot;Somebody&#39;s enthusiastic today, Usagi-chan!&quot; 

Minako was smirking, which is always a sure sign of trouble... She gave 
Mako-chan a quick wink before attacking. 

&quot;So, Usagi... did you you enjoy the film?&quot; 

I gave Mako-chan a stare that would&#39;ve killed a small army. Of course, she just 
put on an innocent little smile and whistled nonchalantly, leaving me to the 
ravening one-woman horde. 

Oh well - if you can&#39;t beat them... 

&quot;Well, the plot wasn&#39;t much, but the lead was just... mmmmm...&quot; I clutched my 
hands to my chest, treating her to a blush and a little giggle. 

&quot;Oh? I hope it wasn&#39;t too long.&quot; 

I just stopped, staring at her, trying desperately to grab my jaw from the 
floor. 

&quot;You what? Mina-chan, how cou--&quot; &quot;The film, Usagi-chan.&quot; She smiled evilly. 

&quot;Why, what were you thinking of?&quot; 

Damn her... 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Luckily for me, we reached the top of the stairs before I managed to go beyond 
merely mortified. Rei-chan waved us over to the veranda, giving a quick prod to 
Ami-chan, who was sat next to her with her face hidden by a magazine. 

Talk thankfully stayed well clear of film studies, and we sat around and chatted 
happily about our plans for the last few days of the holidays. I soon suggested 
that we all spend as much time as possible on the beach (a decision which was, 
I&#39;d like to make it clear, in no way influenced by the ready availability of 
ice-cream). 

&quot;Actually, Usagi-chan, that&#39;s why I asked you here... a friend of mine from 
school is having a huge pool party at her house, and you&#39;re all invited - so 
who&#39;s coming?&quot; 

Ami looked at her uncertainly. &quot;Rei-chan, I...&quot; 

&quot;Come on! It&#39;ll be fun! And there&#39;ll be loads of cute guys there.&quot; 

Right then I&#39;d have sworn I saw Minako&#39;s ears prick up. 

Makoto coughed uncomfortably. &quot;Gomen ne, Rei-chan. I can&#39;t make it... I&#39;ve still 
got to do an essay project for my history teacher, and I&#39;ve only really got this 
week left.&quot; 

Minako looked at her, shocked. &quot;Gods, Mako-chan - that took me weeks! And you 
haven&#39;t even started it?&quot; 

Makoto looked at her dejectedly. &quot;I know... sorry.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s okay.&quot; Ami-chan struck in, giving Makoto a shy smile that seemed to cheer 
her up immensely. &quot;I promised I&#39;d help, but... I guess that means I can&#39;t come 
either.&quot; 

Rei sighed a little. &quot;Oh well. So, Mina-chan? Usagi-chan?&quot; 

Minako grinned at her. &quot;How many cute guys, did you say?&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Saturday dawned not a moment too soon, the sunlight almost painfully bright 
between the curtains. I&#39;d hardly been able to sleep the night before, and I woke 
up almost trembling with excitement. I barely even managed to eat breakfast, my 
stomach was so tight. (It didn&#39;t help that I spent the whole time terrified that 
everyone could see just what I&#39;d been dreaming about all night. I was blushing 
right down to my waist just thinking about it...) 

After a quick (and extremely cold) shower, I managed to calm down enough to 
start packing my things. A little blue two-piece swimsuit, a short black 
cocktail dress and, after a little hesitation, the set of lingerie I&#39;d picked up 
a few days before. (I was more than half tempted to go without, but it would&#39;ve 
been a shame to waste them.) I stuffed everything as tightly as I could into a 
little shoulder-bag, then headed downstairs to negotiate the traditional 
parental inquisition. (Wouldn&#39;t they just love to know what I really get up to?) 

Hours later (well, maybe not, but it certainly felt like it), and much to my 
surprise (and, from the looks on their faces, even more to everbody else&#39;s), I 
actually got to the station on time. 

Minako spotted me first and gave me an enthusiastic wave from across the 
platform, whilst Rei stood nearby and pretended not to notice. Mina had settled 
on a loose green t-shirt and light cotton trousers that whipped around her 
ankles in the breeze. Rei-chan... oh gods, just looking at her made me instantly 
remember every last little detail from my dreams. I probably almost walked off 
the edge of the platform. 

She was wearing a thin white blouse that hinted far too much at what was 
underneath, and a short crimson skirt that should have been illegal. (Well, at 
that moment if she&#39;d so much as touched me I think it would&#39;ve gotten me 
arrested...) I dropped my bag next to theirs and tried very hard to breathe 
until the train arrived. 

Luckily for us it was fairly late in the morning, so we managed to find 
ourselves a couple of seats in the corner of a carriage. Rei swung our bags onto 
the overhead racks (I still can&#39;t reach the darned things...) and sat down by 
the window, whilst Mina and I took the seats opposite. 

We soon got to talking, as the city and the countryside began to flash past 
outside the window. Rei-chan started to tell us where exactly we were going, and 
I tried hard not to stare. I was so distracted that I almost forgot just who was 
supposed to be seducing who... 

That little thought brought me crashing back to earth for a moment. What if she 
really didn&#39;t want me... What if I was wrong? Gods, what would everyone think of 
me? There was only one way to find out. 

I waited until Minako started talking before I tried to attract Rei&#39;s attention. 
She met my gaze with a strange little look on her face, as though she wasn&#39;t 
really paying that much attention either. I gave her a cute smile and crossed my 
legs very slowly in front of her. 

That did it... 

I pretended not to notice the look that flickered across her face, and just 
smiled quietly to myself. Minako was just finishing, and when she asked a 
question Rei practically jumped out of her seat in shock. 

&quot;Sorry, Mina-chan - I was miles away.&quot; She blushed a little, and it made my skin 
tingle. &quot;What was that again?&quot; 

If I had my way she was going to find out exactly why she&#39;d been keeping me 
awake at nights all week. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

We got off the train a little while later, and began to follow Rei&#39;s lead 
through the outskirts of a small town. The road quickly turned uphill, and it 
wasn&#39;t long before we found ourselves outside what had to be the biggest mansion 
I&#39;d ever seen in my entire life. I&#39;ve stayed in smaller hotels! 

&quot;Rei-chan&quot;, I whispered, &quot;are you sure this is the right place?&quot; 

She just smiled and walked in, the huge ornamental gates swinging open in front 
of us. Mina and I just stared in awe. At least, we did until we noticed that Rei 
had almost disappeared out of sight around a bend in the drive, at which point 
we started running. There were probably lost tribes of headhunters lurking in 
the rose garden. 

We caught up with her just outside the front door, just in time to be greeted by 
a cheerful young girl of about my age, with short brown hair that bounced around 
her shoulders. 

&quot;Rei-chan! You made it!&quot; &quot;Of course! I wasn&#39;t going to miss this, was I?&quot; 

The two of them shared a quick hug before she turned to the two of us. 

&quot;Who&#39;re your friends?&quot; &quot;Oh! Mari-chan, this is Minako&quot; who proceeded to give her 
a huge smile &quot;and Usagi&quot;. Rei bent down and whispered something for a moment, 
which set both of them giggling, before turning back to us. 

&quot;Mina-chan, Usagi-chan, this is Mariko. She just came into my class this year. 
This is her parents&#39; house.&quot; 

Mariko waved us inside, showing us where to leave our shoes before leading us 
upstairs. 

&quot;You&#39;re quite early, actually, so you&#39;re in luck - if you want, you can drop 
your bags in one of the bedrooms&quot;, she pushed open a door for us, showing us 
inside, &quot;and I&#39;ll show you around.&quot; 

The bedroom was at least as large as mine, with a huge double bed in the middle 
which looked as though nobody had ever even slept in it. We quickly dumped our 
bags on top, and then we were off again, past bathrooms and dining rooms and 
drawing rooms and ballrooms and... 

&quot;How on earth do you remember all of this?&quot; Minako asked. &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d 
even know where to start!&quot; &quot;Oh, it&#39;s not too hard.&quot; Mariko smiled, her eyes 
twinkling. &quot;Although we never did find my grandmother...&quot; 

Minako stared at her in shock for a moment, before all four of us burst out 
laughing. 

Across the next room, Mariko pointed out through a vast row of patio doors. &quot;The 
pool&#39;s out there, and--&quot; The doorbell clanged loudly, sounding as though it 
could shatter windows. &quot;Oh! I&#39;d better go... if you all go and get changed, I&#39;ll 
see you out by the pool.&quot; She turned and dashed off, smiling happily. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

After a few wrong turns we managed to find our way back to the bedroom and 
started undressing. I took my dress off in the corner, trying very hard not to 
stare at Rei&#39;s reflection in the mirror. I don&#39;t think I managed very well, 
though, because by the time I had my swimsuit on I was blushing all over... 

I turned around to find the others waiting for me, towels in hand. Rei-chan was 
wearing a beautiful black costume which showed her off far too well for my 
comfort, and Mina was wearing a lovely pale yellow one-piece suit which clung to 
her like a second skin. I had the feeling there were going to be some very happy 
spectators out by the poolside. 

We made our way back down towards the garden, which somehow managed to seem even 
bigger than ever. People were milling around the poolsides, mostly just relaxing 
in the sunshine as we approached. Somebody soon waved Rei away to join them, and 
Minako and I took up the task of finding the best two sun-loungers in the place. 
In no time at all we were both lying flat on our backs, basking in the wonderful 
warmth of the afternoon. 

I soon spotted Rei-chan, sat on the other side of the pool and chatting 
obliviously with a couple of her schoolfriends, looking just unbearably gorgeous 
in her bikini. Not one to complain, I settled in for a pleasant afternoon&#39;s 
surreptitious staring... 

After what felt like about a week, I was startled out of some rather nice 
daydreams by a sharp poke to my ribs. 

&quot;What&#39;cha looking at, Usagi-chan?&quot; 

Minako was staring down at me with a nasty little smile on her face. I think 
even my toes blushed... (That girl just knows way too much!) Before she could 
spot exactly how guilty I obviously was, I managed to pick out one of the boys 
at random and do a very conspicuous job of pointing. 

&quot;Isn&#39;t he just dreamy?&quot; (I wouldn&#39;t know - I hadn&#39;t even looked...) &quot;Mouu, 
Usagi! Don&#39;t you have films to be watching?&quot; 

Well, after that I did the only thing I could - I threw Mina-chan into the pool, 
smirk and all. That certainly distracted her. 

Unfortunately, before I could congratulate myself, I (and just about everyone 
nearby) got drowned under a veritable tidal wave from pool. 

The splash-fight that followed was really quite something to see... 

All I&#39;ll say is that it certainly wasn&#39;t me that threw all that water at 
Rei-chan, whatever she says. (And however good she may be with a fire, that girl 
is outright scary with water - Michiru would&#39;ve been proud...) 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Still, things eventually calmed down enough for everyone to actually swim a bit 
(although I&#39;d swear that the pool was a lot shallower...) Well, it wasn&#39;t as if 
anyone had a dry towel by that point. 

I just lay back and drifted for a bit, enjoying the feeling of the water lapping 
over my skin. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something flash past beneath me, 
and turned to see Minako trying to tag another girl under the water, her long 
hair trailing in her wake. 

I was just starting to get an nice idea when she suddenly grabbed my leg and 
dragged me under, kicking and sputtering. 

&quot;You&#39;re it&quot; she mouthed, pointing, before darting off with a satisfied smile. 

Well, I couldn&#39;t let her get away with that, could I? I swam after her as fast 
as I could, chasing her into the crowd of people in the shallow end and knocking 
several people&#39;s legs out from under them before I finally cornered her. 

I grabbed her, giving a little yelp of delight before turning around to escape 
and almost crashing straight into Rei. On impulse I ducked under the water and 
dove between her legs, my hair trailing past the insides of her thighs as I 
popped up behind her. 

Minako stood in front of her, grinning wildly as she tried to guess which way I 
was about to go. I just stood, waiting for Rei-chan to yell at me, but... she 
just stood there with her hands clenched, trembling a little. Sadly, before I 
had a chance to enjoy the moment, Minako made up her mind and leapt, shouldering 
her out of the way as we fled across the pool. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

The sun was starting to dip between the treetops before I managed to get away 
again, leaving Minako chasing a boy who, for some reason, seemed rather willing 
to get caught... 

Rei-chan gave me a little smile when she saw me, turning away from the girl she 
was talking to with a wave. 

&quot;Hey, Usagi. I&#39;m gonna go and get changed - the dance is starting in a bit. You 
coming?&quot; 

With any luck... (and I was quite looking forward to dancing, too) 

&quot;You know how long that ridiculous hair of yours takes to dry.&quot; 

&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; I growled &quot;Stop--&quot; 

&quot;--picking on meeeee!&quot; she retorted, mimicking me far too well. 

She hauled herself out of the pool with a grin, the sunlight gleaming on her wet 
skin as she reached out a hand for me. 

&quot;Come on. And do try not to get lost...&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Much to my surprise (and to Rei&#39;s too, although she&#39;d never admit it) we didn&#39;t, 
and we got back to find Minako&#39;s costume in a heap on the floor, her dress 
already taken. (And she calls me enthusiastic...) 

I undid my hair, shaking it down my back until it dangled wetly down my legs. I 
was just about to start drying it when Rei got there first, making me gasp a 
little in surprise. 

&quot;Let me, silly&quot; she whispered, rubbing it down softly with her towel. Her breath 
was shockingly warm against my neck, and I fould myself drifting away in her 
hands, almost purring with delight as she began to run a fine brush through my 
hair in long, slow strokes. 

It felt like forever before she finished, and I couldn&#39;t help but sigh a little 
with the loss as I opened my eyes. She gave me a shy smile that almost made my 
knees tremble as she handed me the brush. 

&quot;My turn.&quot; 

I waited until she had turned around before I took her hair in my hands, 
grateful that she couldn&#39;t see the look on my face. I dried it down gently, 
patting away the few drops of water that still clung to her and trying 
desperately to control my breathing. Fine, dark strands slid through my hands 
like black velvet as I combed it out, shivering at the little catch in her 
breath as I did so. 

All too soon, though, I had to stop, letting go reluctantly as I went to pick 
out my clothes. One look in my bag, however, soon reminded me that there was a 
lot of fun still left to have... 

I slipped out of my damp bikini, making sure to take rather more time than was 
strictly necessary as I pulled my stockings on, one by one, the black silk 
feeling wonderful against my skin. My hair cascaded down around my head, and I 
took a quick peek between my legs as I leant down, to see Rei-chan standing 
there, gorgeously naked and trying hard not to look. I wasn&#39;t going to let her 
get away lightly. Not now. 

I stepped carefully into the slip, feeling as though it was worth every last 
penny as I fumbled with the garter. Finally I forced myself to stand up, tossing 
my hair back behind me as I fastened the bra around my chest. 

Last, but hopefully not least, I pulled on my dress, wrestling my way into the 
shoulder straps before struggling to free my hair from inside. I jumped in shock 
as I felt warm hands against my back, pushing my hair aside as they did up the 
zip. 

&quot;Rei-chan! You--&quot; I turned around, guiltily. 

Ohgods... 

She was standing close behind me, dressed in a chinese-style silk dress, deepest 
midnight purple, with a collar that clung tightly around her throat and a skirt 
that seemed to be split up to her waist. It took all my willpower not to just 
throw her down on the bed right there and then. 

&quot;You... wow...&quot; I gasped, utterly lost. 

She trailed a finger along my cheek, her eyes sparkling. 

&quot;You don&#39;t look too bad yourself, Usagi-chan&quot; she smiled. &quot;Now, let&#39;s get down 
there and enjoy the party, ne?&quot; 

She opened the door to leave, jumping in surprise as she almost walked into 
Minako, who blushed madly before dashing inside to fetch something out of her 
bag. 

&quot;Come on, you two!&quot; She was practically bouncing with excitement, dragging us 
both out of the door before we could even start to protest. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

The party itself was amazing; the house was packed with people, filling the 
dance floor and spilling out into the garden. The air was almost breathlessly 
hot, humming with music and hundreds of voices. 

As always, Mina had clearly come with a plan prepared, so I was quickly whisked 
off into crowds of utterly gorgeous guys. Needless to say, we soon had something 
of a following. (It wasn&#39;t exactly what I&#39;d had in mind, but... well, 
distractions like that I wasn&#39;t going to complain about...) 

A while later (well, I had to make sure that I wasn&#39;t interested, didn&#39;t I?) I 
finally managed to slip away, a crowd of eyes following me around the room. 
After a bit of hunting I eventually spotted Rei standing at the edge of the 
dance floor, watching distractedly. 

Seeing her standing there gave me an idea... 

&quot;Ne, Rei-chan... let&#39;s give everyone a show&quot; I whispered, creeping up behind 
her, making sure I was still being watched. 

She jumped, and I&#39;d swear she looked slightly guilty for a moment. &quot;Usagi! 
What&#39;re you--?&quot; 

Before she had a chance to get properly angry at me, I grabbed her hand and 
yanked her onto the dance floor, almost falling over with the effort. (I&#39;ll 
never know how she manages to fight in heels - I have enough trouble standing 
up!) 

In a reflex undoubtedly born from years of practice, Rei managed to save me from 
the evil machinations my feet, and I found myself in the rather enviable 
position of having both her arms around my waist. (What can I say? I&#39;m just 
naturally clumsy...) 

Never one to waste an opportunity, I quickly returned the favour, pulling myself 
towards her until our noses almost touched (and, purely by accident of course, 
brushing against her legs a little). 

I smiled up at her apologetically. &quot;Sorry...&quot; 

It seemed to take her eyes a few seconds to focus before she finally managed a 
reply. &quot;Come on then.&quot; She sighed pointedly, slipping one arm around my shoulder 
and drawing us into a lazy spin. 

Her dress felt like warm ice against my skin as we danced, closer and closer and 
slipping away again, every little touch making me shiver. The scent of her skin 
seemed to float around me as I moved, the faint tang of woodsmoke and the 
tiniest hint of jasmine. 

With a gentle push she sent me spinning into a pirouette, held together by 
nothing more than our fingertips. I let myself go, feeling wonderfully dizzy, 
letting my hair trail around behind me, brushing it across her legs. 

The music seemed to be getting faster and faster, and I&#39;m sure I heard Rei gasp 
as she pulled my hips tightly against her, dropping me back into a deep dip as 
the song reached its climax. 

I lay there for a moment, motionless, staring into her beautiful eyes, hardly 
even able to breathe. Gods, I wanted so much to kiss her... but that was for 
later. I gave her a quick smile, and then we were away again, the rhythm 
pressing us tightly together. 

A sudden burst of sound and I was sliding away from her, running my hands all 
around her, barely touching. She closed her eyes, writhing towards my fingers, 
giving a tiny little sigh that seemed somehow louder than every other voice in 
the room. 

Another rapid crescendo and the music changed again, leaving me standing right 
behind her, my arms at her sides. Rei-chan had her hands on my hips, and looked 
utterly lost in her own little world. I slipped my hands lower as she danced, 
her dress sliding through my fingers, and... well, I couldn&#39;t resist one more 
little tease, giving her ass a quick squeeze as I passed. 

I heard her gasp slightly, and then she just... stopped, spinning round to stare 
at me, her eyes flaring. &quot;You...&quot; she hissed. 

Oops... I guess that was once too many... 

I gave her my best look of startled innocence, feeling like I was stuck in the 
headlights of an oncoming car. 

&quot;Upstairs. Now.&quot; 

She grabbed my hands and literally dragged me from the dancefloor, my heart 
pounding madly. I don&#39;t think my feet even touched the stairs once... 

It was all I could do to keep up with her as she pulled me along the corridor, 
flinging open a door at random and shoving me inside. 

...which was something of a shock to the couple on the bed. 

Blushing furiously, she dragged me out as fast as she could and grabbed 
desperately for the next door along. Which, of course, was the broom cupboard. 

I get the feeling my hysterical fit of the giggles didn&#39;t help much either. 

To her credit, Rei-chan somehow managed to keep up an air of righteous 
indignation as far as the next room, which, much to our mutual relief, was 
empty. We both practically collapsed inside, gasping for breath. 

&quot;Rei-chan... what wa--?&quot; 

Before I&#39;d even gotten the question halfway out of my mouth, she spun round and 
pinned me against the door, forcing me into a kiss that made my whole body 
tremble. I grabbed desperately at the warm fabric of her dress as her tongue 
brushed across my lips, moaning longingly. 

With an obvious effort, she pushed herself away, staring into my eyes with a 
look that seemed to set my skin on fire. 

&quot;Usagi&quot; she hissed, &quot;you little tease...&quot; 

One hand slid delicately down my back, making me arch myself towards her. 

&quot;Mmm...&quot; I struggled to speak. &quot;Rei-chan... please...&quot; 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; She trailed her hand around my waist, moving up to cup my breast firmly. 

&quot;What was that?&quot; 

&quot;Please...&quot; I struggled weakly against her, my breath caught in my throat. 

She leant down, pushing me into a bruising kiss, flicking at my nipple with a 
fingertip as I practically screamed her name. Her tongue danced in my mouth as 
she pulled herself closer against me, her other hand wrenching the zip open down 
my back. 

Her nails left burning tracks across my back as she pulled the dress down around 
me, biting hungrily at my throat. I gasped wordlessly, slipping shivering hands 
up her legs, purple silk parting around them, making my skin tingle. Her skin 
was burning hot beneath my fingers as they ran higher and higher, grabbing at 
the bare skin of her ass with a pang of desire that made my knees weak. 

She growled at me, cat-like, batting my hands away and flinging me back against 
the cold wood of the door. My eyes flew open in shock, and then I was hers 
again, one leg pressing between my thighs as she caressed my ass and dragged me 
up into an overwhelming kiss. I could only writhe helplessly against her, trying 
to wrap myself around her warmth, my body singing with need as she slipped 
between my lips. 

One hand ran sharply up my side, slipping beneath my bra and shoving it roughly 
over my skin, her every breath driving me mad as she nipped and kissed her way 
down my neck. Her lips, her fingers seemed to be everywhere at once as she 
finally took my aching nipple between her lips, biting it painfully as my body 
clenched endlessly around her, screaming her name like a prayer. 

When I could finally breathe again, I opened my eyes to find her smiling down at 
me, cradling me in her arms as I shivered, my legs too weak to hold me. One hand 
tangled in my hair, pulling my head back sharply into a soft kiss that seemed to 
linger forever on my lips. I moaned quietly, leaning after her as she pulled 
away. 

&quot;Oh no. You don&#39;t get away that easily, Usagi-chan&quot; she whispered, pulling me 
across towards the bed. 

&quot;Lie down&quot; she ordered. I did, the air and the sheets cold against my damp skin. 

Before I could move, she sat down above me, kneeling either side of my chest and 
forcing my wrists back above my head. She leaned across me for a moment, and I 
gasped to see her holding one of the pillowcases stretched between her hands. 

&quot;Rei-chan... what--?&quot; 

Without waiting for me to finish, she grabbed hold of my wrists once more, 
pressing them against the icy metal of the headboard and tying them tightly. I 
writhed desperately, the feeling terrifying and almost painfully exciting all at 
once, her dress brushing over my skin. She leant down and kissed me softly, 
rolling my exposed nipple between her fingertips. 

&quot;Now, what should I do with you?&quot; she asked me, nipping at my earlobe until I 
could barely manage to speak. 

&quot;Please...&quot; 

She began to slowly, tantalisingly kiss her way down my body, across my face, 
lingering at my throat, leaving me bucking helplessly towards her slighest 
touch, my skin burning hot beneath her. One hand toyed with my bra, finally 
freeing my other breast, the nipple aching at her touch as she slid her weight 
down to my waist. She held it between her fingers for a moment, pulling it away 
until I almost cried out in pain, then dragging her tongue across the tip, 
leaving me helpless with need. 

I could barely manage to focus my eyes as she smiled at me again, blowing cold 
then hot across my other breast, running her nail across the nipple absently. I 
bucked against her once more, squeezing my legs together as tightly as I could, 
desperate for her touch. 

At that she slipped further away down the bed, pressing my legs apart with her 
hands as she kissed her way across my stomach, running the tip of her tongue 
around my belly-button. My skin quivered under her lips; she was so close... I 
wanted so much to beg her, implore her to touch me, but I couldn&#39;t seem to 
breathe any more... 

She ran her hands around my hips, dancing across the skin as she began to unhook 
the tops of my stockings, tugging softly at the waistband of my panties. The 
damp fabric clung deliciously to my skin as she slowly, slowly pulled them down 
my legs, biting gently at the inside of my thighs. 

Finally finished, she flung them away from the bed, lapping at the tips of her 
fingers as she stared into my eyes. I strained weakly to lift my head up as she 
knelt down before me, leaning lower and lower, her hot breaths drifting over my 
skin like a thousand tiny kisses, and then nothing, as she waited and waited and 
waited and... 

Her tongue brushed across my lips and I screamed, writhing towards her, my whole 
body shaking, freezing, melting at her touch. 

She kissed me again, not giving me a moment&#39;s respite, drawing purest burning 
warmth from within me, until I was crying her name with every breath... and 
still she continued, my eyes rolling back, screaming her name, and I couldn&#39;t 
breathe and I didn&#39;t ever want to breathe again... 

------------------------------------------------------------------

The next thing I remember is opening my eyes to find her lying alongside me, my 
whole body drenched in sweat, my muscles aching deliciously. She smiled, kissing 
me lightly, and I tasted myself faintly on her lips. I wriggled against her, 
glad to find my hands free, running them through her tangled hair, making her 
sigh softly. 

I leant in closer, and then, with a strength I didn&#39;t even know I had, I forced 
her down onto her back, trapping her between my legs as I ran my tongue across 
her lips. 

&quot;Your turn.&quot;

Epilogue

------------------------------------------------------------------

So, there you have it. I know I want him, but I need her, too... 

I&#39;m not too sure why I&#39;m writing this to you... the gods know I really shouldn&#39;t 
be, but... perhaps it&#39;ll help me make up my mind. 

Still, on the bright side, I&#39;ve got another date with Mamo-chan this weekend, 
and Rei-chan&#39;s having a sleepover on Wednesday. I think trying to decide could 
turn out to be a lot of fun, ne? 

Yours, 
Tsukino Usagi 


I smiled quietly to myself at the thought, folding the letter slowly in my 
hands. The wind whipped playfully across the bay, making one last grab for it. 
It was out of luck tonight, though. 

A small yowl startled me, and I looked down to find a young cat rubbing itself 
around my ankles. I reached one hand down and rubbed its head affectionately. 

&quot;You too, hey?&quot; 

It purred happily, pressing itself back against my fingers. Maybe not. 

&quot;Hey! Seiya! There you are. I&#39;ve been looking all over for you!&quot; 

The voice made me jump, and I almost fell off the pier, the letter fluttering 
away into the sunset. 

&quot;Taiki! Gods, don&#39;t make me jump like that!&quot; 

He smiled at me, offering me a hand up. 

&quot;What the heck is it that you&#39;re always doing out here anyway?&quot; 

I took his hand, following him away through the darkening streets. 

&quot;Oh, nothing. Just daydreaming...&quot;
