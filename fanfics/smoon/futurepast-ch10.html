Blood splattered across her fuku as the senshi of the ocean destroyed 
all three youma before her.

As their beastly bodies faded into nothingness, Neptune collapsed onto 
her knees. Her breath came in short, ragged gasps and sweat dripped from 
her brow from the half hour effort to defeat the latest youma threat. It 
was a testament that the monsters were getting stronger, and that, 
though her own senshi skills had greatly improved, her increased 
abilities could not make up for her lack of a partner by her side.

Long fingers met her temples soothingly as Neptune reminded herself of 
the conclusion she had reached a week ago. That, in this life, there was 
no one to fill the duty of Uranus, that the Haruka of this age was not 
destined to be by her side. Destiny and duty were two terms that the 
blackened shell of Uranus didn&#39;t seem to understand...

But it didn&#39;t matter. Despite the pain her decision had caused her, she 
had decided to set her would be partner and lover free.

In her exhaustion from battle, Neptune&#39;s power drained from her body 
like sand through her fingers. A quiet half-chuckle, half-sob escaped 
Michiru&#39;s lips as she was left kneeling in the deserted construction 
site. Even the powerful ripple that charged the atmosphere and heralded 
the arrival of an ally couldn&#39;t hope to raise her spirits.

&quot;You&#39;re a bit late.&quot; Michiru said, bitterness lacing her voice as she 
met her friend&#39;s garnet gaze. &quot;You usually show up when I need you the 
most.&quot;

Pluto frowned at her hopeless ally, caught off guard by the frustration 
in the small woman&#39;s voice. &quot;That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m here right now.&quot;

Michiru averted her eyes in Pluto&#39;s deadly serious gaze. In the past 
week since Haruka had again refused her, Pluto had frequently come to 
her aid in battle against the nameless youma that heralded a great evil 
and Michiru had successfully evaded her age-old friend&#39;s careful 
questioning for the entirety of that time. After all, the Guardian of 
the Time Gate was sure to know the outcome of her no-so-fateful meeting 
with Haruka. But the look in her friend&#39;s eyes now told her that the 
subject could no longer be avoided.

&quot;Why don&#39;t you go to her?&quot; It was more a statement than a question that 
the formidable Pluto commanded.

&quot;Isn&#39;t it obvious?&quot; Michiru&#39;s brow furrowed as she picked herself up off 
the ground, a hurtful betrayal lacing her voice. &quot;Haruka made it very 
clear that she doesn&#39;t want me meddling in her life.&quot;

Pluto met her friend&#39;s defiance. &quot;That was the shell of Uranus talking, 
not Haruka. You know better, Michiru.&quot;

The aqua haired girl snorted, trying for apathy and flippancy but 
conveying hopelessness. &quot;Look Pluto, neither one of them wants anything 
to do with destiny or duty. The least I can do is grant Haruka her 
wish.&quot;

Pluto approached her saddened friend slowly. Michiru&#39;s despair was 
complicating matters. It was not Michiru&#39;s nature to give up so easily. 
It appeared that fate was beginning to warp and twist her the same as it 
had Uranus after Neptune&#39;s death at the end of the Silver Millennium. 
Not only did the fate of the world hang in the balance without the 
powerful alliance of Neptune and Uranus in this new age, but also the 
fate of the well being of Pluto&#39;s best friends. Her family.

Laying a hand on her fellow senshi&#39;s shoulder, the sapphire haired woman 
walked a thin line to try to help her friend see the error in her ways. 
&quot;Haruka&#39;s wish is null and void. The confusion in Uranus&#39; mind eight 
hundred years ago obviously distorted such importance as destiny and 
duty. You can&#39;t rely on her to understand it&#39;s meaning, you have to show 
her.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s mouth clicked shut audibly. Even Pluto suspected as much, and 
was even urging her to try again. She finally met her ally&#39;s garnet eyes 
to find hope and confidence there.

Pluto smiled. &quot;Wasn&#39;t is Uranus herself who asked you not to give up on 
her?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re destined to fight this Silence together, you and I. But I&#39;m 
afraid the Uranus of this time isn&#39;t ready to meet you, Neptune, and I&#39;m 
not sure she will ever be ready. I&#39;m sorry, but please don&#39;t give up 
hope.&quot;

The aqua haired girl gasped. Pluto was right. Uranus had approached her 
in a dream, in a nightmare future that she, as Neptune, swore to help 
eliminate. &quot;But...&quot;

The senshi of time went off on a tangent. &quot;Of course, it wasn&#39;t just the 
shell of Uranus who reached out to you, it was the embodiment of who 
Uranus once was. Think about it, Michiru, the real Haruka contacted you 
then. You know she&#39;s still there, hidden behind the walls that the shell 
of Uranus had constructed eight hundred years after the fall of the 
Silver Millennium, when she had become distorted to the point of pushing 
away her destiny and duty. The Haruka who knows and loves you is still 
there, Michiru.&quot;

Michiru couldn&#39;t help but be swept up in Pluto&#39;s hopeful tirade, 
becoming lost in her excited expression as her friend&#39;s excitement grew. 
She had already suspected all of this, yet Haruka&#39;s refusal to join her 
had darkened her hope. Even with Pluto&#39;s encouragement, doubts still 
filled her mind. &quot;But Pluto, I don&#39;t know how to get through to her.&quot;

An honest smile tugged at the ancient woman&#39;s lips, confidence in her 
ally shone in her garnet eyes. &quot;Just be yourself, Michiru.&quot;

&quot;Be myself?&quot; The slight woman&#39;s brow furrowed as though saying such 
words for the first time in her life. Such a simple answer to such a 
complicated problem.

Pluto nodded. &quot;Only by being true to your persona of your past life will 
you be strong enough to help Haruka to understand that which she needs 
so desperately in this one.&quot;

Michiru stood frozen, rooted to the ground as such implication shook her 
to her core. Pluto was right, by having modified her approach to dealing 
with a changed Haruka, how could she ever expect her lover of old to 
recognize not only who she once was, but who Haruka herself once was? 
She needed to be her truest self if Haruka was going to remember what 
they had shared, what they could share once again...

But was she strong enough to face the cold and bitter woman once more?

Suddenly, Michiru&#39;s senses went on full alert, every muscle in her body 
tensed and her cobalt eyes opened wide. Something was wrong. Something 
was terribly wrong...

Haruka was in danger.

&quot;Pluto, I-&quot;

The Guardian of the Time Gate nodded knowingly and began to fade from 
the mundane plane. &quot;Go.&quot; She said quietly, her words not even reaching 
Michiru&#39;s ears as the young woman ran, relying on her instincts to guide 
her.
The high collar of the fireproof racing suit itched terribly as Haruka 
detachedly scratched at the back of her neck. Another race had been 
successfully won hours ago, but still she milled around the garage. Not 
wanting the company of her competitors, she found herself alone with her 
thoughts.

The spotlights turned to the stage, illuminating an elegant, young, aqua 
haired woman. Resplendent in her ivory gown, her graceful fingers coaxed 
gentle music from her violin.

Haruka&#39;s hands balled into tightly clasped fists as the image of the 
aqua haired woman again entered her mind unbidden. In the past week 
since she had seen her last, Haruka&#39;s tumultuous thoughts had lingered 
on Michiru, remembering her beauty and grace just as much as the 
frightening hidden message buried in her painting that had called her to 
a duty she had refused. Try as she might to push away all thoughts of 
she who was associated with completely opposite emotions, Haruka found 
she had been fighting a loosing battle. She even realized she longed 
track down the famous violinist, to see her just once more, even if from 
afar...

Haruka spat viciously at her warring emotions, berating herself for 
spending so much time and energy on a future that she had already 
refused.

A future that no matter what her mind had decided, her heart couldn&#39;t 
accept...

Haruka&#39;s muscular frame froze as she focused all of her concentration on 
a struggling voice that just barely caught her attention. As if brought 
to her on the wind itself, the blonde ran after the distress call that 
had summoned her.

&quot;Is someone here?&quot; Her brash voice precluded her appearance as she 
twisted under the half open door of a neighboring garage. Her confident 
expression slid into one of worry as she examined a lone boy in the 
middle of the garage. His brown bangs shielding his eyes, he seemed to 
be in much pain.

&quot;What&#39;s up, are you okay?&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice sounded alien to her ears, a 
strong sense of foreboding crashing over her like a wave. Despite the 
cryptic circumstances, for having felt most of her life as though she 
were in the wrong place at the wrong time, she found that somehow, she 
now suddenly felt like she was in the right place at the right time.

&quot;Help!&quot; The young boy struggled hoarsely before collapsing to his knees, 
grabbing at his chest as his humanoid body changed and shifted. Haruka&#39;s 
breath caught in her throat and she froze in terror as she found herself 
alone before a hideous monster with too many eyes and too many arms.

&quot;Youma!&quot; She exclaimed.

Falling back to an unknown instinct, Haruka&#39;s clammy hands reached for 
the object nearest her. She acknowledged the comforting weight of a 
crowbar definitively. She took a confident step towards the frightening 
monster, the crowbar in her right hand ready to swing when she suddenly 
remembered the boy the youma had originated from.

The opportunistic monster took advantage of the woman&#39;s wavering resolve 
and lunged at the frozen blonde. Lightening quick reflexes allowed 
Haruka to raise her makeshift weapon, holding it before her defensively. 
The youma seemingly smirked at her, its horrid stench closing in on her 
nostrils as the piece of metal, insufficient to protect her from such a 
beast, was flung from her grasp.

Her body stiff with fear, Haruka could almost feel the youma&#39;s razor 
like teeth on her skin when a glowing light caught her attention, 
causing the monster to pull back quickly as if fearful of whatever 
secrets the light promised.

Before the blonde&#39;s wide, hazel eyes hovered the light source, a 
glowing, ornate rod, an object she had never before seen but somehow 
understood. With an ancient, seemingly familiar power, it called to her. 
The world seemed to stop as her hand reached out to the powerful object 
numbly, the pull she felt from it too great to ignore, as though the rod 
itself were the key to all that would make her whole...

&quot;Don&#39;t!&quot;

A sharp, familiar voice pulled Haruka from her trance and the rod fell 
from mid air, clattering on the concrete floor with a metallic clang. 
Haruka&#39;s breath caught in her throat as she turned to an aqua haired 
girl framed by the doorway. The same aqua haired girl she had so 
desperately longed to see since their last meeting. It was Michiru, and 
Haruka was spellbound by her beauty.

&quot;Don&#39;t touch it!&quot; Michiru urged. &quot;Once you&#39;ve touched it, you can never 
return to a normal life!&quot; The aqua haired woman&#39;s pained voice conveyed 
the fact that although she didn&#39;t regret becoming a senshi herself, she 
understood Haruka&#39;s resistance.

Haruka felt the urgency from the other woman, felt the pain the very 
words brought her as she spoke, and knew she was the cause of that pain. 
It was then, that before her eyes, Michiru&#39;s revealed the identity that 
the other woman had known she had harbored all along.

In the span of a second, though to Haruka it felt numbingly slow, 
Michiru had raised a rod, similar to the one that she had urged her not 
to take, and had uttered a phrase so ancient that Haruka could almost 
remember its origin. The aqua haired girl was engulfed in light and 
color to be subsequently left in a scant outfit too familiar to be 
coincidence. Haruka found herself thinking that such an outfit on such a 
woman would undoubtedly have gotten herself into much trouble...

And yet there she stood in front of her. Sailor Neptune, her would be 
partner who she had refused not only in her dreams, but in real life. A 
shiver ran down Haruka&#39;s spine, intense emotions of fear and loneliness 
brought by her image slammed into her like a tangible force and she was 
left breathless.

Yet, for as much as her mind wanted her to run, her heart kept her feet 
rooted. Her heart begged her to wait and listen to what Neptune would 
say, and for once, as if this woman&#39;s words may be more important than 
anything Haruka had ever heard in any life, the blonde complied.

In a blink of an eye, the blonde was pulled from her thoughts as the 
monster, now recovered, lunged towards them. Neptune took action, and 
the youma was thrown backwards by the incredible power she possessed, 
slamming into a wall at the back of the garage to land in a boneless 
heap.

Although in awe, Haruka remembered the boy that surely still remained in 
the hideous body of the creature and she latched onto the diversion to 
keep her thoughts off joining the aqua haired woman. Even as Neptune 
prepared another attack, she stepped into her way purposefully.

&quot;Stop it!&quot; The blonde&#39;s voice echoed in the empty space and both women 
froze, each questioning the meaning behind such powerful words until she 
could clarify herself. &quot;This was a human being a little while ago! Are 
you okay... with killing people?&quot;

The tall woman was passionate, yet unsure. The words that reached her 
own ears sounded empty, as if some unnamed duty she had once known had 
demanded such obligation from her, an obligation that she had once 
willingly accepted...

A duty she had refused in this life.

Neptune&#39;s cobalt eyes couldn&#39;t quite hold Haruka&#39;s hazel gaze and she 
glanced away somewhat resignedly. She knew that in this life, without 
the full memories of her last, Haruka would not understand such a 
terrible necessity for the sacrifice of a few for the good of the whole.

&quot;The silence is approaching.&quot; The senshi of the ocean used the nightmare 
future, the visions she knew they both shared, as a crutch. &quot;If I don&#39;t 
do this, there will be more sacrifices!&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes narrowed dangerously, her mind trying to interpret too 
many possibilities, both consciously and subconsciously. Meanwhile, her 
heart simply urged her to help this woman, to join her battle, to be by 
her side, as a partner and... something more.

But that would be to accept a convoluted duty she didn&#39;t fully 
understand, a duty that frightened her. There was much she didn&#39;t 
understand... Could this woman with the cobalt eyes who seemed to 
understand her when she didn&#39;t even understand herself, have all the 
answers she needed?

&quot;So you don&#39;t choose this way?&quot; Haruka&#39;s consciousness didn&#39;t understand 
the question she asked, but her heart did.

And so did Neptune. Sensing that Haruka&#39;s subconscious was reaching out, 
as Uranus&#39; had in a dream so long ago, she had to grab it, had to make 
the fearful Haruka understand that her duty as a senshi, her destiny as 
her lover, wasn&#39;t a choice... it was a requirement. Without each other, 
neither would be whole. For Michiru, there was no choice about loving 
Haruka or being Sailor Neptune any more than there was a choice to 
breathe the air she needed to survive.

&quot;No. I don&#39;t choose this way.&quot;

Haruka frowned at such a simple answer, and while her heart was ready to 
accept Neptune&#39;s brief, yet powerful reply, her mind rebelled at the 
implications that she didn&#39;t want to accept. How could she throw away 
her life as she knew it for something that frightened her so? She&#39;d 
always been alone. She was meant to be that way.

&#39;No one could love me. I&#39;ve always been alone.&#39; Haruka&#39;s negative 
thoughts dragged her down, reinforced her resolve.

The sound of the youma&#39;s scream as it charged was deafening and both 
women froze in horror when as it rapidly approached. Knowing she had 
made the same move many times over, instinct guided Neptune and she 
didn&#39;t hesitate as she threw herself in the youma&#39;s path. She could see 
the look of surprise on Haruka&#39;s face when she pushed the taller woman 
out of the way, the force her small frame was able to apply to Haruka&#39;s 
larger one surprising the other woman as the blonde tumbled backwards 
and into safety. With a detached sense of dread, Neptune felt the teeth 
and claws of the youma sink into her tender flesh and felt the warmth of 
her blood as it stained her fuku.

Eyes wide and unbelieving, Haruka watched helplessly as the aqua haired 
girl took the blow that had been meant for her. A resounding shattering 
resonance, akin to the beginnings of a structure about to collapse, 
echoed in her mind as a memory suddenly flooded her senses.

flashback

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Neptune shouted, her arms pushing Uranus&#39; form away from her. 
She breathed a sigh of relief when the blonde haired woman landed far 
enough away from her, but she knew there was no time left to save 
herself.

A spark of blinding electricity arched through the sky and the air was 
suddenly alive with energy. It only took a second for Neptune to fall to 
the ground, unmoving. It had happened so fast that the aqua haired woman 
hadn&#39;t even had the chance to scream. With wide eyes, Uranus&#39; jaw hung 
slack, unable to form words as she gaped in disbelief at the sight in 
front of her.

/flashback

Detachedly, Haruka realized she was reliving the single event in her 
past life that had shaped her into the person she had become. A person 
different than the one she was meant to be...

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot;

At the sound of Neptune&#39;s voice laced with pain, Haruka&#39;s shaking frame 
snapped back to reality as she watched the senshi of the ocean deliver a 
powerful attack to her enemy. The aqua projectile, shaped for the planet 
she was named for, searched for the creature who had injured its 
mistress and with a deadly impact, engulfed and obliterated the threat. 
In the aftermath, the helpless boy from whom the monster had spawned lay 
unconscious on the floor.

flashback

Uranus found herself crawling on her hands and knees to her partner&#39;s 
fallen body, stunned and unfeeling as the brainwashed humans 
apathetically marched around and past their fallen forms. Detachedly, 
she noticed the dark form of the creature in the sky advance without a 
second glance, yet the shouts and screams of death that emerged from the 
Moon Palace barely phased Uranus at all as she pulled her partner into 
her arms gently.

/flashback

A powerful instinct guiding her, Haruka found herself crawling to 
Neptune where she knelt, exhausted and injured on the garage floor. 
Numbly, the blonde&#39;s arms went out, encircling Neptune in her warm 
embrace, pulling her back and cradling her injured form to her torso.

The weight of the smaller woman felt familiar in her arms, and as Haruka 
looked down at the petite form that seemed to fit so perfectly within 
her embrace, a million images fought for prominence in Haruka&#39;s head, 
each vying for a turn at the forefront of her mind. Slowly, yet surely, 
the walls and barriers that held the memories of her past life hidden in 
the recesses of her mind began to break and crack, each memory that 
surfaced dislodging another formidable brick that held each barrier in 
place...

The intrigue of an initial meeting with this cobalt eyed woman, a 
growing friendship, budding love, undeniable passion, a sense of duty as 
a senshi... all of it laid just beyond the reaches of her full 
understanding.

&quot;The monster?&quot; Neptune asked, her voice tired and hoarse. The energy 
drain she had suffered while battling the previous youma battle was 
quickly catching up to the energy she had expended to save Haruka.

The blonde forced her attention to the woman in her arms. &quot;It&#39;s returned 
to human form, don&#39;t worry.&quot; Her voice was automatic, her mind elsewhere 
as the memories of her past life competed for prominence in her crowded 
head...

Pluto, their best friend and closest ally, Hotaru, the daughter they 
raised together, the confession love she&#39;d shared with her partner, each 
word that Neptune spoke brought more memories, good and bad, crashing 
back to her.

&quot;I almost killed it. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll kill it next time.&quot; Past the point of 
exhaustion, Neptune&#39;s own mind began to wander, the pressure of her duty 
too heavy for her shoulders alone. She didn&#39;t want to make sacrifices 
any more than Haruka did, but it was a reality of her duty. &quot;It isn&#39;t 
easy, but I chose to become a senshi.&quot;

&quot;Then, why did you protect me?&quot; Haruka&#39;s searching voice asked with a 
hint of desperation. Although the memories of her past life had showed 
her otherwise, in this life, no one had ever done such a thing for her. 
Certainly she hadn&#39;t felt as though she had done anything to deserve 
such kindness. She instantly regretted all she had done to this woman 
when time and again, Neptune had put her life on the line for her. Just 
as she had in their past lives...

&quot;If you hurt your hands, you can&#39;t be a violinist.&quot; Haruka fell back on 
any excuse she could find instead of speaking her confused feelings.

Michiru smiled smally. &quot;I didn&#39;t snoop around just because you&#39;re a 
senshi. Before I knew that you were the one... &quot; The aqua haired girl 
finally looked up at the blonde, her voice less desperate, more hopeful 
as she reminisced. &quot;I was watching you during a race. I always wanted to 
ride in your car along the coastline just once...&quot;

Haruka&#39;s arms unconsciously tightened around Neptune&#39;s form when she 
revealed the truth of the statement she had issued not long ago. Michiru 
had been speaking about herself. This woman had been watching over her 
for so long, trying to help her, trying to connect with the half of 
herself she had been missing, and Haruka had only pushed her away.

Michiru&#39;s voice broke hoarsely. &quot;You never asked any favors of anyone. 
You&#39;re always faithful to your feelings.&quot; Her eyes glassed over, 
remembering Haruka&#39;s strength during the Silver Millennium, confusing 
the incarnations of her lover in her exhaustion.

&quot;I&#39;m not faithful, I&#39;m always running away.&quot; A ghost of a smile spread 
across Haruka&#39;s lips as she tried to reconcile the two sides of herself, 
her two separate personas, now made apparent with her newfound memories. 
The carefree, easy lover of what was called the Silver Millennium and 
the bitter, blackened woman she had become in this life. Still, the 
event that had changed her so still lay hidden from recognition, still 
locked behind one last formidable barrier that continued to urge her to 
run from the woman in her arms.

Her eyes searched Neptune&#39;s, trying to see beyond the love they once 
shared, to see what this woman saw in her in this life. What kept her 
coming back after each refusal she had suffered? Was it an obligation to 
duty? A shiver ran down Haruka&#39;s spine at the thought and she fought 
with herself not to release the woman in her arms to the unforgiving 
floor.

It was then that she flinched, feeling the warm blood that seeped 
through Neptune&#39;s fuku. Blood she had shed for her. More memories of 
their life as senshi came flooding back to Haruka and her fingers 
tightened around Neptune&#39;s arms.

Holding her partner&#39;s limp body, feeling her blood, seeing her 
exhaustion, Haruka remembered that Neptune&#39;s greatest strength wasn&#39;t 
just physical. &#39;She always was the strongest of the two of us.&#39;

Neptune sighed. Feeling a mixture of anxiety and hope, she understood 
that Haruka was reliving her memories yet she kept her silence, wanting 
the headstrong blonde to reach her own conclusions. It was always one of 
the traits Haruka had loved best about her, that, for all Michiru&#39;s 
constant support, she also knew when to give Haruka her space when 
absolutely necessary.

&quot;I know more about you than you do, because I watch you all the time.&quot; 
Neptune finally explained in response to Haruka. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to 
take the same way I took.&quot; Finally reaching a parallel with her persona 
of the past by both laying her feelings on the line openly and without 
reservation and giving Haruka the space she needed, Neptune hoped that 
Haruka would be able to do the same.

And if not... she was still willing to set her lover of the past free.

A smile pulled at Neptune&#39;s lips and though her eyes held much physical 
pain, a slight blush colored her cheeks. &quot;Still, I was happy when I 
found out that you were the one...&quot; Exhaustion taking over her fully, 
she finally realized the lack of response from Haruka. Not knowing if 
she had succeeded in either setting the shell of Uranus free, or helping 
the wayward Haruka to remember her true persona, tears came to Neptune&#39;s 
eyes. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t mean to talk about it... sorry.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s blank expression softened slightly as a tear slid down 
Neptune&#39;s cheek. Here was the woman who had frightened her, crying over 
her, crying for her. &#39;How could I have ever felt fear for this woman who 
has loved me so?&#39; She asked herself.

As she watched the gentle tear slide down Neptune&#39;s cheek, fragments of 
her past life continued to come together in Haruka&#39;s mind. People, 
places, things, emotions, all of them linking with the visions she&#39;d had 
in weeks past to form a chronological timeline of a life gone by. From 
beginning to end, her memories sketched and further defined the Haruka 
of the Silver Millennium, who she once was, who she should have been in 
this life, too.

&#39;Only, why am I so different?&#39;

That was when Haruka realized that she hadn&#39;t reached the end of her 
timeline at all, that for her, there was life beyond Neptune&#39;s death.

Her frame shook involuntarily as eight hundred years of loneliness 
crashed over her and from almost a third perspective, Haruka watched her 
own slow deterioration into the shell of Uranus, saw what her mind had 
done to itself. How she had warped the very meanings of that which had 
made her who she was; destiny and duty.

In her own warped mind after Neptune&#39;s death, the two had become 
affiliated with pain and fear, a self defense mechanism to protect 
herself against further pain as she wandered the universe alone... but 
it was this warping of that which had eased her suffering that was also 
that which had also destroyed her. In her twisted mind, duty had become 
the destructive force of Metallia who had taken all she had held dear, 
and destiny was what had made living on without her partner so 
unbearable...

From such a detached standpoint, Haruka realized what she had done to 
herself and in such a revelation, it was once again revealed to her 
wayward mind the importance that destiny and duty truly held for her. In 
reality, it was duty that had brought her strength and confidence as an 
outer senshi once being coupled with the powerful force that was 
Neptune, and it was destiny that had brought her love in the form of 
Michiru.

It was then that she realized that the woman in her arms, the 
reincarnation of her lover past, was the one embracing her. Neptune. 
Michiru. And she realized that although the last eight hundred years of 
her past life and the entirety of her current life had been painful and 
difficult, it was her partner of old who suffered now. She suffered 
because Haruka was not at her side. She suffered because they did not 
share that closeness of partners... the closeness of lovers.

The only way to right the wrong she had caused in her past was to right 
her future.

A small smile touched Haruka&#39;s lips as her hazel eyes traced the lines 
of the aqua haired woman&#39;s face, already so familiar. This woman would 
always be there for her, with her, at her side. Somehow, she knew she 
had nothing left to fear.

With a resounding crash, the last of the walls that the devastated 
Uranus had built around her heart collapsed as Haruka made her decision. 
She knew it would take time to fully adopt the carefree nature of her 
original persona, but she knew that with Michiru&#39;s help, she could do 
it. She could once again become the woman that Michiru, that Neptune, 
needed.

Now, Haruka was ready to embrace her duty as the senshi of Uranus. She 
was ready to embrace her destiny by Michiru&#39;s side, for now she knew 
that it was only the partnership and love they shared that could make 
them both whole again.

Haruka&#39;s eyes returned to the metal rod that had fallen on the garage 
floor, the rod that, in her selflessness, Michiru had urged her not to 
accept. Never losing her hold on the woman in her arms, her hand reached 
out for the now familiar henshin rod. Grasping the smooth alloy in her 
hand, she sighed contently at its weight and familiarity. Resolute and 
determined, with no doubt left in her mind, Haruka knew it was time to 
embrace herself, to return to that which made her who she was.

Determined hazel eyes caught hold of nervous and exhausted ones of 
cobalt. &quot;Thank you.&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice was quiet and calm.

&quot;For what?&quot; Neptune&#39;s confusion mingled in her exhaustion.

&quot;For freeing me from my barriers.&quot; The golden haired woman responded 
slowly, a small, soft smile on her angular face.

She felt the breath of the woman in her arms catch in her throat, felt 
the quickening heartbeat beneath her injured ribcage. The look of hope 
and happiness indicated in the widening smile on Neptune&#39;s face produced 
a toothy grin on Haruka&#39;s own.

&#39;It&#39;ll be different in this life, in this darker time, after the tragedy 
that occurred eight hundred years ago. But perhaps with this woman by my 
side, we can forge a new love, one based on the success of our past, for 
it&#39;s she who represents my future.&#39; Haruka nodded her own confirmation, 
&#39;Definitely.&#39;

Haruka&#39;s eyes shut lightly. A bright warmth filled her as the ancient 
words came to her, triggering a powerful transformation. With a rush of 
power brought by the wind itself, she was once again in tune with her 
element, in tune with herself. She was once again Uranus, a vital piece 
of her persona. She was ready to join her partner, and hopefully, her 
lover, of the new millennium.

Sailor Uranus rose to her feet. The woman in her arms seemingly light as 
a feather, she set her partner down carefully, holding Neptune&#39;s shaky 
frame to her own for support. No words were needed between them as they 
laced their fingers together, each staring at the other, each reading 
the world of emotions in the others eyes.

&#39;One thing I know for certain... my heart already beats for her.&#39;
