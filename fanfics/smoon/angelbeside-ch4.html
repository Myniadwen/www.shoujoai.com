All the Senshi had been informed by Mamoru&#39;s phone call the next day. No 
one could really think of a reason for why Usagi had lied to Mamoru 
about going to Rei&#39;s place. Even Luna seemed to have no idea. Then again 
she hadn&#39;t seen the blonde princess in two days.&quot;She has been quiet 
lately, more serious and mature.&quot; Makoto suddenly said while she and the 
others were waiting at the shrine for Usagi to show up.

&quot;Maybe she&#39;s getting more aware of how serious it is to be a queen, or 
atleast to become a queen. She is trying to give it her best.&quot; Luna 
stated. She was sitting next to Artemis at their usual spot. In front of 
the senshi, having a clear view of what was happening around them.

&quot;But have you looked at her Luna, she looks so empty. She is trying to 
hide it but she can not hide such things from her friends. Or atleast 
not from me. Something is obviously bothering her. I don&#39;t think she is 
acting so mature all of a sudden because she finally realised how 
serious it is to rule as a queen. I think it has something to do with 
the fact she is having doubts about that future.&quot; Ami whispered. 
Everyone looked at her in surprise.

&quot;Do you know something we don&#39;t know?&quot; Rei questioned the blue haired 
girl who shook her head.

&quot;Ofcourse not but I can still remember how she reacted when she was 
revealed as our princess. She didn&#39;t want to be a princess, she wanted 
to be Usagi Tsukino. A normal teenager. She always believed that after 
this mission she would be able to live up to that dream but she can&#39;t.&quot; 
Ami added.

Minako thought about the other&#39;s words for a couple of minutes before 
shaking her head.&quot;No.&quot; She said. By this point everyone was looking at 
her. No one asked her anything but instead of that they just gave her a 
questioning look.&quot;She&#39;s engaged with Mamoru for what, four days now?&quot; 
Minako said. It wasn&#39;t a real question so no one answered. She 
nodded.&quot;About four days, yeah. She&#39;s just scared. I read in a magazine 
that 50 percent of the female population get cold feet right before the 
wedding.&quot;

&quot;Minako, I know that must sound really obvious to you and maybe all of 
us but all due respect...Usagi&#39;s wedding won&#39;t happen until June.&quot; Rei 
said, ignoring the cold glare her secret lover was giving her. Yes, 
secret lover. She and Minako had decided not to tell the others about 
their relationship. Not in fear of not being accepted but simply because 
they hadn&#39;t found the right moment to tell them.

&quot;Hi everyone...&quot; Suddenly a voice said. All four girls turned around to 
face the small blonde.

&quot;Hi Usagi, We&#39;re so glad you could make it!&quot; Makoto said, walking up to 
the blonde she hadn&#39;t seen in two days or so to give her a hug. She 
stopped when she suddenly noticed Michiru. She was walking towards them 
as well. The brunette turned around, giving the others a questioning 
look but they seemed to be just as confused about Michiru&#39;s appearance 
as Makoto.

(Two hours ago)

Slowly Usagi pushed the door to Michiru&#39;s bedroom open.&quot;Michiru, are you 
awake?&quot; She asked. When she didn&#39;t get a reply she decided to wake the 
sleeping girl up. Michiru had slept for one whole day and she thought it 
would be time to wake the other up.

&quot;I am awake, you don&#39;t have to be so sneeky.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice came from 
under the covers. Usagi smiled as she straightened up and closed the 
doorb ehind her again, walking towards the bed and sat down on the edge.

&quot;How are you feeling?&quot; The blonde wanted to know. She could see 
movements come from under the covers.&quot;Ah you&#39;re super lazy. Even 
compared to me.&quot; Usagi joked, crawling on top of the aqua haired girl 
and pulled the blankets away.

&quot;The light!&quot; Michiru whined as she covered her eyes with her hands.

&quot;Yep, you sound perfectly ok again.&quot; Usagi stated. She was still sitting 
on top of the aqua haired girl who was trying hard to get back to sleep 
again.&quot;Michiru...&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice grew serious again. Michiru seemed to 
notice this because the moment after Usagi had said her name she dropped 
her hands, staring up at the blonde.

&quot;Yes?&quot; She asked.

Usagi blushed when she realised she was still sitting on top of the 
other. Quickly she crawled off Michiru. The older girl giggled at the 
blonde&#39;s nervous behaviour.&quot;What I wanted to ask...&quot; The princess 
paused, trying to regain her calm composure which was hard. The blush on 
her face grew deeper.

&quot;What?&quot; Michiru asked.&quot;Why are you blushing?&quot;

&quot;Your...&quot; Usagi whispered. She seemed to be embarrassed.&quot;I can see 
your...uh...&quot; Usagi looked away, staring at the cupboard across the bed. 
Michiru whow as still confused gazed down at her robe which had slightly 
moved, revealing her breast for a small part. At this point she was 
blushing as well but at the same time she started laughing.

&quot;We&#39;re both girls Usagi, you act like you just saw something dirty on 
the discovery channel.&quot; Michiru said between fits of laughter.

&quot;It&#39;s not funny.&quot; The blonde whispered, still staring at the cupboard.&quot;I 
am not used to seeing...&quot;

&quot;But you did see Mamoru&#39;s...&quot; Michiru didn&#39;t dare to finish her 
question, this conversation was obviously making the other feel 
uncomfortable.&quot;Sorry, I won&#39;t ask. Now why don&#39;t you tell me what you 
woke me up for?&quot;

Usagi seemed to be relieved about the change of subject.&quot;Uhm well, ah 
first look me into the eyes and tell me you are truly feeling ok.&quot; Usagi 
said. Once again Michiru giggled.

&quot;Usagi, I can&#39;t look you into the eyes. You&#39;re the one who is staring at 
my...&quot; She followed Usagi&#39;s eyes.&quot;At the cupboard.&quot; She finished. 
Quickly Usagi looked back at the aqua haired girl who straightened up 
the robe she was wearing.&quot;Ah you see, I am feeling fine. I just needed 
sleep. I haven&#39;t slept for quite some time.&quot;

The blonde stared at the aqua haired girl for a couple of minutes as if 
she was examining her before nodding.&quot;Ok I believe you. Now what I 
wanted to ask was...Well...If you...Mhh you wanted...I..&quot; She seemed to 
have a hard time asking her question.

&quot;You can ask me Usagi, I won&#39;t bite.&quot; Michiru said with a wink.

&quot;Iwaswonderingifyouwantedtocomewithmetothesenshimeetingthisafternoon!&quot; 
Usagi said. Michiru gace her a confused look.

&quot;You were wondering if I...what?&quot; She asked.

The other took a deep breath.&quot;If you wanted to come with me to the 
senshi meeting. If you don&#39;t want to or if yuo still feel a bit sick 
just tell me.&quot; Once again Usagi stared at the cupboard instead of facing 
Michiru. Until she felt Michiru&#39;s hand on her shoulder which caused her 
to turn her head back again.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind coming along.&quot; Came the reply.

Usagi smiled.&quot;It&#39;s not like...Well I want to tell the others about my 
true feelings for Mamoru and that I am not going to continue...I am just 
afraid they won&#39;t understand.&quot;

&quot;So you decided not to stay with Mamoru?&quot; The blonde nodded.

&quot;I had some time to think about it while you were sleeping and I&#39;ve 
decided I want him to be happy with someone who truly deserves him. I 
haven&#39;t found the courage to tell the others before but I think it is 
about time to tell them the truth. I hope that as my friends they will 
understand.&quot;

Now it was Michiru turn to smile.&quot;I am glad to hear that and I am sure 
they&#39;ll understand but you don&#39;t need me for that.&quot;

&quot;I know...&quot;

&quot;Maybe you should confront them with this without me. They are your 
friends, I don&#39;t think they really like me that much. I mean sure 
they&#39;re nice but...Do you really think they would want me there when you 
tell them?&quot;

Usagi nodded.&quot;Atleast I got you to back up for me in case they react 
like I fear they will. I can already hear Luna&#39;s screams when she finds 
out.&quot;

&quot;If you are sure, I will come with you. And don&#39;t worry. It is your life 
and no matter what they say...&quot;

&quot;It will always be my decision, not theirs.&quot; Usagi finished for her aqua 
haired friend.&quot;I know Michi...thanks a lot for your faith in me.&quot; 
Michiru flinched at that nickname. Haruka used to call her that before, 
before they broke up. When Usagi also noticed her mistake she quickly 
looked down at the ground again, apologizing.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it is ok. I like that nickname.&quot; Michiru stated. It was 
the truth but at the same time a lie. She liked being called &#39;Michi&#39; but 
the memories attached to that nickname bothered her.

-Flashback-

&quot;Michiru I have to tell you something...&quot; Haruka whispered. She gazed 
nervously at the beauty in front of her. Michiru smiled, taking the 
blonde&#39;s hands in hers.

&quot;Haruka you can tell me anything...Is something bothering you?&quot;

&quot;Not bothering.&quot; Came the reply.&quot;I need to confess something but I 
am...&quot;

&quot;Afraid?&quot; Michiru wondered out loud.

&quot;Afraid.&quot; Haruka stated with a smile.&quot;I don&#39;t want this to affect us...I 
like the way we are now.&quot;

&quot;Haruka?&quot; The aqua haired girl&#39;s heart was racing in her chest. Was 
Haruka really saying what she thought she was?

The tomboy swallowed away the lump that had formed in her throat.&quot;Michi, 
I...&quot; Michiru smiled upon hearing that nickname. She had never heard 
Haruka calling her &#39;Michi&#39; before. This had to promise something good.&quot;I 
love...you.&quot; Haruka finally managed to say. Michiru was so surprised 
that she had no idea what to say at first. By the same she realised she 
had to say something Haruka had already pulled away, looking down at the 
ground as she started to make small steps backwards.

&quot;I love you too Ruka.&quot; Michiru finally said, catching up with Haruka by 
making a small run before pressing her lips together with Haruka&#39;s.

-End Flashback-

&#39;Why did you tell me you loved me in the first place, no one told you to 
lie.&#39; Michiru thought. She was shaken out of her thoughts by Usagi 
again.

&quot;Are you alright Michiru, you were spacing out. Are you feeling sick 
again, headache, stomache, cold?&quot; The blonde asked concerned.

The older girl nodded.&quot;Yes, yes I am fine. Sorry. I was just thinking 
about...&quot; ...Haruka, again! ...&quot;About how you could probably tell Mamoru 
about your true feelings without hurting him.&quot; She lied.

Even though Usagi knew the other was lying she decided not to mention 
it. If Michiru wanted to tell her then she would do it eventually.&quot;I 
don&#39;t think I will tell him today. I need to think this through. I mean 
tell the others will be different from telling Mamoru. I know he will be 
hurt and mad and pained but...&quot; A tear rolled down the princess&#39; cheek 
but it just sticked with that one tear. No more followed.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry Usagi, it&#39;ll be fine. If he loves you he will understand.&quot; 
Michiru stated, placing her hand on the other&#39;s shoulder once more.&quot;Now 
let me get ready. I need to find some clean clothes and I desperately 
need a shower.&quot; Usagi nodded but stayed put. After a few seconds Usagi 
finally realised that Michiru needed her to leave the room in order to 
get dressed.

&quot;You can stay if you want but you seemed to have some problems with that 
before when you saw a part of my...&quot; Michiru got interrupted by Usagi 
who jumped up and hurried to the door.

&quot;No it&#39;s ok, I gotta go and do...something in the livingroom anyway!&quot; 
She yelped and with that said she disappeared in the hall, closing the 
door behind her. Michiru giggled to herself. Usagi truly was a cute yet 
innocent girl.

On the other side of the door Usagi leaned against the wall, breathing 
heavily.&#39;Why am I so nervous around her, I&#39;ve seen Rei naked before. 
Accidentally but I wasn&#39;t as embarrassed or...&#39; She decided not to give 
this any attention. She had other, more important things, on her mind.

(Present, Hikawa Shrine)

&quot;Hi everyone...&quot; A voice said. All four girls turned around to face the 
small blonde.

&quot;Hi Usagi, We&#39;re so glad you could make it!&quot; Makoto said, walking up to 
the blonde she hadn&#39;t seen in two days or so to give her a hug. She 
stopped when she suddenly noticed Michiru. She was walking towards them 
as well. The brunette turned around, giving the others a questioning 
look but they seemed to be just as confused about Michiru&#39;s appearance 
as Makoto.

&quot;Oh hey Michiru, we hadn&#39;t been expecting you as well.&quot; Makoto said, 
giving Usagi a small yet tight hug before shaking Michiru&#39;s hand.&quot;It&#39;s 
nice to see you again. Both of you.&quot; To be honest, Makoto wasn&#39;t really 
happy with the aqua haired girl&#39;s appearance. The outer senshi usually 
never came to their meetings. It had always been something for just the 
five of them. Then again Michiru never had been such a bother to them. 
She was a quiet girl.

&quot;Ah yes.&quot; Michiru said, returning the other&#39;s handshake.&quot;Usagi insisted 
me to come along.&quot;

&quot;So she has been with you and Haruka?&quot; Rei asked, stepping towards them 
as well. She gave Usagi a skeptical glare.&quot;Do you know how worried 
Mamoru is about you? He called me last night to check if you were with 
me. It seemed to claimed I called you?&quot; It sounded like a statement but 
there was obviously a hint of a questioning tone in her voice.

Usagi scolded Rei for betraying her like that. The other three inner 
senshi including Michiru were now looking at Usagi.&quot;I thought you said 
you called him and told him you were with me.&quot; Michiru said. The blonde 
princess blushed. Maybe inviting Michiru along wasn&#39;t such a great idea. 
Now she had to explain herself to everyone including Michiru for why she 
had lied.

&quot;I...well you see, that&#39;s actually a funny story.&quot; Usagi started but Rei 
cut her off.

&quot;Spare us your lies Usagi. We&#39;ve been talking a bit and we&#39;ve all come 
to one conclusion.&quot; The raven haired girl spoke.&quot;You are hiding 
something from us and Mamoru. You can&#39;t just run off like that and leave 
everyone worried. Besides you are late again, we thought you had gone 
missing!&quot;

&quot;Rei, calm down.&quot; Makoto said, giving the miko a warning look. If Rei 
would upset Usagi then there would be no way for Usagi to tell them what 
was going on.&quot;Now Usagi, why don&#39;t you tell us what is bothering you. 
It&#39;s not like you to lie.&quot;

Ami seemed to be the first one to notice that there was something wrong 
with this picture. She had seen nor heard a car drive up to the temple. 
This would mean that Michiru and Usagi either took a bus here or they 
had come walking.&quot;Didn&#39;t Haruka bring you?&quot; She asked. Michiru went wide 
eyes at that questioned as she shivered. Then she calmed down and gazed 
down at the ground.

&quot;Michiru...&quot; Minako wanted to start but was cut off by the other blonde.

&quot;Michiru and Haruka aren&#39;t together anymore.&quot; Usagi stated.&quot;Listen you 
guys...I went to Michiru&#39;s place because I needed to tell someone 
about...It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t trust you with my problems but I needed 
someone&#39;s opinion and well, believe it or not, fate made me choose 
Michiru by accident.&quot;

&quot;Usagi, just tell us.&quot; Rei whispered, giving Michiru an I am sorry look. 
She wanted to know more about why Haruka and Michiru had broken up but 
by the looks on Michiru&#39;s face she decided otherwise. Michiru obviously 
wasn&#39;t ready for it yet.Michiru just nodded and gave the raven haired 
girl a greatful smile. With that she focussed on Usagi again.

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be with Mamoru anymore!&quot; Usagi finally said. &#39;Stupid 
Usagi, stupid. I could&#39;ve tried to make it sound less cruel and direct.&#39; 
She scolded herself. While she had been speaking those words she had 
stopped looking at her friends. Her eyes were now closed as she waited 
for them to start yelling and disagreeing with her. Much to her surprise 
it stayed quiet.

Slowly she opened one eye. The others just stood there, the looks on 
their faces showing nothing but shock. She opened her other eye as 
well.&quot;Guys...I can&#39;t believe I am saying this but could you please say 
something?&quot;

Even though Usagi&#39;s words sounded like a helpless plead to their ears 
the four inner senshi stayed quiet. They were speechless. From all the 
things they had been assuming that would be bothering their blonde 
princess this was the last thing they had expected.&quot;What exactly do you 
mean?&quot; Rei finally managed to ask. She simply couldn&#39;t believe that 
Usagi had meant it in the way it had sounded.

&quot;I don&#39;t love Mamoru. Yes, I care about him but not as lovers care about 
eachother. I love Mamoru like I love you guys. As a good and close 
friend.&quot; Usagi whispered, confirming Rei&#39;s fear.

&quot;D-do you know w-what that means to...&quot; Ami stammered, unable to finish 
her question. Instead of that Makoto finished for her.

&quot;To our future?&quot; Usagi just nodded.

The only one who had been quiet for a while had been Minako. When 
Michiru gazed over to the blonde goddess of love she was surprised to 
see the shocked look disappear from her face as it was replaced by an 
honest smile.&quot;That&#39;s great news!&quot; Minako cheered. Everyone turned around 
to look at her, raising their eyebrows.

&quot;He was good for nothing anyway. Ok, ok that sounded mean but all he did 
was get kipnapped, get charmed over by the enemy and believe some silly 
dreams. Usagi deserves much better anyway! And don&#39;t look at me like I 
lost my mind because I know that you all secretly agree with me.&quot; The 
blonde cheered, running over to Usagi. With that she started hugging the 
blonde princess who was still too shocked by Minako&#39;s reaction to move.

&quot;Minako...&quot; Rei started but decided not to make any comments. She knew 
all too well that Minako never really liked Mamoru. She had told her a 
million times before. This was the only time she had heard Minako say 
something like that in front of anyone else.

&quot;Usako, I was so worried.&quot; Suddenly a male voice said, surprising 
everyone. In shock Usagi pulled away from Minako to look up at her 
fianc&eacute;e.

&quot;M-mamoru...&quot; The blonde stammered in shock. Then she went back to her 
usual act and put a fake smile on her face.&quot;I am so sorry to have 
worried you!&quot; She said, running over to him and hugging the man 
tightly.&quot;I was on my way to Rei when I bumped into Michiru. She was kind 
of down so I decided to cheer her up.&quot; Another lie. She just hoped he 
wouldn&#39;t ask anything about it.

The five other girls and the two cats who hadn&#39;t said anything and just 
watched the scence stared at the two &#39;lovers&#39; in front of them. Now that 
they knew the truh about Usagi&#39;s feelings the scence in front of them 
had lost its reality somehow. Mamoru smiled at hearing Usagi&#39;s words. He 
knew she was lying but he was, at this point, happy about knowing for a 
fact that she was safe and in his arms.

&#39;Blind fool.&#39; Rei thought. She didn&#39;t like to admit it but Minako was 
right. He wasn&#39;t good enough for Usagi. He was too blind to even see 
that something was bothering his fianc&eacute;e. Plus, if this man really 
didn&#39;t make their princess happy than they had no other choice but to 
accept that and just see what the future would bring them.

Michiru had stopped looking at the scence in front of her as she 
clenched her fists. She didn&#39;t know why but somehow all of this made her 
remember of her times with Haruka. Had Haruka faked her smile, her 
feelings for Michiru just like Usagi faked her smile and feelings for 
Mamoru as well?

To be Continued...

Ah in the next chapter I will promise all of you some romance between 
Usagi and Michiru. Top class! Haha, you&#39;ll see what I mean.</pre>
