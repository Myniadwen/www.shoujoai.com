<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 15 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>	Ami sat at her mother&#146;s table and nervously pushed the food 
around on her plate.  She listened as Makoto struggled to keep up the 
small talk and marveled at the girl&#146;s ability.  Only Makoto&#146;s closest 
friends would have noticed the strain in her voice.  Ami, for her part, 
could barely make eye contact with her mother, let alone hold up any 
conversation.  Beyond hello, she hadn&#146;t said much of anything since 
arriving at the house, and she knew it was making her mother suspicious.
	There was a lull in the conversation.  The only sounds Ami could 
hear were her own breathing and the slight clanking of the silverware 
as it touched the plates.  Those sounds, coupled with the quick, 
furtive glances her mother kept throwing her, pushed Ami&#146;s tension 
level over the edge.  Her fork fell to her plate as she closed her eyes 
as tightly as she could and took a deep breath.  Then, in one swift 
exhale, &#147;For the last month, Mako-chan and I have been intimately 
involved, and when she moves next weekend, I want to go with her.&#148;
	Everything stopped and went completely silent.  Ami slowly opened 
her eyes to see both her mother and Makoto staring at her in disbelief.  
Makoto&#146;s mouth hung open slightly, her eyes wider than they had been a 
few minutes ago.  Kaya&#146;s eyes, on the other hand, had narrowed, and her 
mouth had formed into a tight line.  Then her gaze turned slowly from 
Ami to Makoto.
	Makoto shifted uneasily.  &#147;Well,&#148; she said, putting on a nervous 
grin, &#147;that&#146;s not exactly how I would have put it, but&#133;&#148;
	Using very controlled motions, Kaya set her utensils down on her 
plate.  Placing her napkin neatly beside it, she said coolly, &#147;I see.  
Well, I think this meal is over.  I&#146;d like for the two of you to join 
me in the living room, please.&#148;  Kaya then got up and left the table 
without looking at either girl.
	Makoto smiled weakly at Ami.  &#147;That could have been worse.  At 
least she didn&#146;t yell.&#148;
	&#147;My mother doesn&#146;t yell,&#148; answered Ami, swallowing the 
nervousness she felt rising in her stomach.  &#147;Come on,&#148; she said as she 
stood.  &#147;We don&#146;t want to keep her waiting.&#148;
	Makoto slipped her fingers around Ami&#146;s as they walked the short 
distance to the living room.  She squeezed them briefly before letting 
go when they reached their destination.  Pausing there in the doorway, 
Makoto was uncertain how to interpret what she saw before her.
	Kaya slowly paced back and forth in the living room, her hands 
clasped behind her back.  She stopped when she saw Ami and Makoto, and 
waved them over to the couch.
	When the girls were seated, Kaya said calmly, &#147;Before I say 
anything else, I want to get this out of the way.  Ami, you should 
already know this, but I&#146;m going to say it anyway.  I love you, and 
that will never change no matter what you do.  Makoto, I have nothing 
but respect for you and how you&#146;ve handled yourself with everything 
you&#146;ve been through.  That being said, I think the two of you can 
understand why I have some issues with this.&#148;
	&#147;Mizuno-san,&#148; said Makoto quickly, standing and bowing before the 
woman, &#147;if you&#146;ll allow me?&#148;  When Kaya nodded, Makoto continued, &#147;I 
know the situation I want to bring Ami into looks bad, and that there 
isn&#146;t really anything I can say to make it seem better to you.  All I 
can tell you is that I love Ami.  I have for a long time, and I can 
take care of her properly if you&#146;ll allow me to.&#148;
	&#147;You love her,&#148; repeated Kaya, her tone questioning.  &#147;You&#146;ve 
loved her so much and for so long that as soon as she went away you 
slept with someone else without giving it a second thought?&#148;
	&#147;Mom!&#148; said Ami, horrified that her mother would say such a thing.
	&#147;No, Ami,&#148; said Makoto, stopping the other girl from saying 
anything more.  &#147;Your mother has the right to question this.&#148;  Her 
fists were clenching at her sides, and it was obvious she was fighting 
to control her temper in the face of what she felt was a personal 
attack.  Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Makoto went on, &#147;I 
wasn&#146;t with Ami then.  I wouldn&#146;t have done it if I had been.  You see, 
at the time, I was looking for something, and I thought maybe I could 
find it with him.  It was a mistake, one that I&#146;ve made before.  Partly 
it was because I was never comfortable with how I felt, and I didn&#146;t 
think anyone else would be either, so I tried to make it go away.  I 
never thought I&#146;d be given a chance to find what I was looking for with 
Ami.  I&#146;m sorry that I hurt her with what I did, but I didn&#146;t know how 
she felt then.  That may not be much of an excuse, but it&#146;s the only 
one I have.  And whether I deserve it or not, Ami has forgiven me.  And, 
for what it&#146;s worth, I really do love her.&#148;
	Kaya carefully studied the girl before her for several moments, 
then said, &#147;I&#146;d like to speak with Ami alone, please.&#148;
	Makoto looked nervously at Ami, then back to Kaya.  She nodded, 
then offered a polite bow to the woman before leaving the room.
	When they were alone, Kaya looked down to her daughter.  The poor 
girl looked like she was waiting for the executioner&#146;s ax to fall.  
Then Kaya realized that Ami was, in a sense, and it bothered her 
greatly to be looked at as the one wielding it.
	Without meaning to, Kaya began a slow trek back and forth in 
front of her daughter.  &#147;I&#146;ve heard what Makoto had to say, and I know 
what she wants,&#148; said Kaya.  &#147;Now I need to know what you want, Ami.  
And I need for you to be completely honest with me.&#148;  She stopped 
moving and stood with her arms crossed over her chest, not realizing at 
all how intimidating it made her seem.
	Hands wringing in her lap, Ami looked up at her mother and said 
in a small voice, &#147;I want her.&#148;  She looked down quickly, her cheeks 
warming at an uncomfortable subject.  &#147;I love her and want to be with 
her.  The baby as well.  I want them to be part of my family.  To do 
that, I need to be there with them, but not as a visitor or friend or 
even as Mako-chan&#146;s girlfriend.  I need to be there all the time, not 
just because Mako-chan needs me, but because Miki will also.  It still 
sounds a bit strange to say this, but it feels right when I do.  I need 
to be there as a parent, Mom.  I can&#146;t do it properly if I&#146;m living 
somewhere else.&#148;
	&#147;As a parent,&#148; repeated Kaya slowly.  Her fingers came up to 
pinch the bridge of her nose.  &#147;I think I need to sit down,&#148; she said 
as she moved unsteadily to the couch.
	&#147;Mom, please try to understand,&#148; pleaded Ami.
	Kaya looked at her child, a small, gentle smile forming on her 
lips.  &#147;Sweetheart, I do understand,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;I understand 
that you love her, and that right now because of that you feel like you 
need to be with her every second of every day.  I also understand that 
the kind of love you feel blinds you to all of someone&#146;s faults and all 
of the problems that may come up from becoming involved in a 
relationship like this.&#148;  Kaya reached over a placed a hand over Ami&#146;s.  
&#147;Ami, you&#146;ve only been with her like this for one month.  That&#146;s barely 
a drop in the bucket compared to the sort of commitment you want to 
take on.  I&#146;m afraid the two of you don&#146;t fully comprehend that.&#148;
	Kaya stood suddenly and began to pace once again.  &#147;What you are 
suggesting is, essentially, a marriage.  It&#146;s hard enough when two 
fully grown adults try to make it work.  The two of you are still in 
high school, and with the baby&#133;  It just makes the odds that much worse, 
because babies, as much as we may love them, don&#146;t always make things 
better.  More often than not, they just make things harder.&#148;
	Stopping a few feet from Ami, Kaya turned to her daughter.  &#147;Now, 
understand that I don&#146;t have a problem with you wanting to see each 
other.  I&#146;m fond of Makoto, and if you&#146;re willing to accept the 
situation the way it is, then I won&#146;t try to tell you not to.  However, 
anything beyond that, at the moment, I can&#146;t agree to.  Finish high 
school first.  Spend some time getting to know each other as a couple 
and everything that entails, and if you still want this at that point, 
I&#146;ll give you my consent.&#148;
	Ami shook her head almost imperceptibly.  Then, surprising both 
her mother and herself, stood and said, &#147;No.&#148;  Taking a breath and 
pushing forward before Kaya could recover, Ami went on, &#147;Graduation is 
over a year away.  The baby is due in three months.  I admit that we 
may not completely understand what it&#146;s going to be like after he&#146;s 
born or what it&#146;s going to be like for us together with him, but we&#146;ll 
figure things out.  But to do that, I need to be there now.&#148;
	&#147;You can still be there, Ami,&#148; returned Kaya, moving a bit closer 
to Ami.  &#147;I just want you to take a step back and really see the 
situation you&#146;re walking into.  Give it some time so that you&#146;re 
absolutely certain this is what you want so you don&#146;t have any regrets 
later on.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m already certain of what I want,&#148; said Ami, her voice gaining 
strength in desperation.  &#147;The only regret I could and do have in any 
of this is missed time.  If I wait until I finish school, an entire 
year of Miki&#146;s life will have passed.  If someone had told you to take 
a step back after I was born and to wait a year to decide if you really 
wanted me, what would you have done?&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s not the same thing, Ami,&#148; answered Kaya.
	&#147;It is to me,&#148; replied Ami.  &#147;Miki is my son.  If I lose that 
year with him, I won&#146;t ever get it back.  Makoto will wait for me if 
she has to.  She&#146;ll even understand why you want us to slow things down 
a bit.  But how can I explain to my son that I had to spend a whole 
year trying to decide if I wanted him or not?&#148;
	Kaya sighed deeply and ran a hand through her hair.  &#147;Oh, Ami,&#148; 
she said quietly as she stepped forward and took her daughter into a 
loose hug.  As Ami&#146;s arms slowly came up to return the hug, Kaya rested 
her chin on top of Ami&#146;s head and said, &#147;I just don&#146;t want you to get 
hurt.  You are my only concern in all of this, Ami.  I want you to be 
happy, but I don&#146;t want you to lose yourself in the moment.  You had so 
many plans for your future.  Have you even considered what you&#146;re going 
to do about college?  You used to talk about going abroad to study.  
You even had all the best places picked out for each field you were 
interested in.  Do you understand how much of that you&#146;ll have to give 
up if you take this on?&#148;
	Ami pulled back so she could see her mother&#146;s face, but didn&#146;t 
completely release her.  &#147;I think I&#146;m gaining more than I&#146;m giving up,&#148; 
she said.  &#147;Besides, I decided some time ago, even before Mako-chan, 
that I wanted to stay here and go to school.  Some of the best schools 
in the country are right here in my own backyard, and I hardly consider 
attending them as settling for something less.  Plus, my friends are 
all here, as well as my family,&#148; said Ami, smiling up at her mother.  
&#147;I don&#146;t want to leave any of them.  And you know you don&#146;t have to 
worry about Mako-chan ever forcing me to stay or trying to keep me from 
doing something I want.  If she thought I wasn&#146;t happy or truly wanted 
to study someplace far away, she would likely take me down to the pier 
and put me on the next boat out herself.&#148;
	Returning the smile Ami was giving her with just a bit of sadness, 
Kaya said, &#147;You&#146;re still supposed to be a little girl, you know.  I 
feel like I&#146;ve missed a step somewhere.&#148;
	&#147;I think we&#146;ve all been feeling a bit like that lately,&#148; replied 
Ami.
	Kaya held Ami&#146;s gaze for several seconds longer, then slowly 
nodded.  &#147;Okay, Ami.  Okay.&#148;  She sighed.  &#147;Before anything else 
happens, the three of us need to sit down and talk.  There are some 
things I want made clear before I actually agree to this.&#148;  Kaya 
couldn&#146;t help but smile at the huge grin that lit up Ami&#146;s face.  She 
added, &#147;But we&#146;re going to do it after I clean up the dinner dishes.  I 
need some time to digest all of this for myself.&#148;
	Ami hugged her mother tightly then.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; she said 
happily.
	Kaya chuckled.  &#147;Don&#146;t thank me just yet.  I still get to try and 
scare off your girlfriend with evil glances and stories of your 
childhood.&#148;



	Makoto stood in the hallway leaning against the wall.  She tilted 
her head back and blew air nervously through her lips.  It was too 
quiet in the living room.  The lack of yelling made her more anxious 
than she would have been if Ami and her mother had started fighting.  
At least if they had gotten loud, she would be able to hear what was 
going on.
	Footsteps pulled Makoto out of her thoughts, and she stood 
straight as Kaya and Ami appeared.  Makoto licked her lips as they 
approached her.
	Kaya stepped up to Makoto, and, after a second, gave the girl a 
gentle smile.  &#147;The three of us are going to have a long talk.  But I 
think we all need to take a few minutes to catch our breath first.&#148;  
She reached up and patted Makoto&#146;s cheek lightly, then headed back 
towards the dining room.
	Makoto watched Kaya as she left, then turned to Ami, confusion on 
her face.
	Ami smiled at her girlfriend.  &#147;It&#146;s okay, Mako-chan.  Mom&#146;s 
worried about some things, but she&#146;ll say yes.&#148;  Ami moved forward and 
put her arms around Makoto&#146;s waist in a hug.
	Relaxing at the feeling of having Ami near her, Makoto returned 
the hug.  She closed her eyes and took a few deep breaths as she held 
her love close.  Quietly she said, &#147;I was beginning to think I&#146;d done 
the wrong thing by insisting we tell your mom.  I don&#146;t know what I&#146;d 
do if she tried to take you away from me.&#148;
	Ami pulled back a bit and smiled up at Makoto.  When the other 
girl returned it, she said, &#147;Don&#146;t worry, Mako-chan.  That isn&#146;t going 
to happen.  Mom isn&#146;t going to do that.  No one is.&#148;
	Makoto pulled Ami back to her and stood just holding her.  She 
kissed the top of Ami&#146;s head and rested her cheek against the softness 
of Ami&#146;s hair.  She felt safe like this, and for the first time in her 
life, Makoto began to think that maybe Fate wasn&#146;t so cruel after all.
	

*            *            *

	Shifting her bag more comfortably on her shoulder, Kaya knocked 
firmly on the apartment door.  The lateness of the hour made the sound 
seem unnaturally loud in the stillness of the corridor, and she cringed 
slightly at the dull echo.
	Ken answered the door a minute later, a novel in his hand and 
bookmarked with a finger.  He smiled when he saw her.  &#147;Hi,&#148; he said.
	&#147;Hi,&#148; Kaya answered.  &#147;I thought you might like some company.&#148;
	&#147;Always,&#148; replied Ken as he moved aside for her to enter, taking 
her overnight bag from her as she did.  &#147;I thought Ami was going to be 
home tonight,&#148; he said as they moved into the livingroom.
	&#147;So did I,&#148; said Kaya.  &#147;She and Makoto came by for dinner, but 
they had other plans for the evening.&#148;  She chuffed lightly and turned 
to Ken with a smirk on her face.  &#147;They&#146;re sleeping together.&#148;
	Surprise crossed Ken&#146;s features.  &#147;They?  Ami and Makoto?&#148;
	Kaya nodded.
	&#147;Are we still guessing?&#148; he asked.  &#147;Or do we know for certain 
this time?&#148;
	&#147;They came by tonight specifically to tell me that,&#148; Kaya 
answered.  She sat on the couch, folding her arms and resting them on 
her knees.  &#147;Well, not *exactly* that, but that they&#146;re together.  
Better yet, when Makoto moves into her new apartment Ami wants to move 
in with her so they can raise the baby together.&#148;
	&#147;Sounds like you had an eventful night,&#148; said Ken as he came to 
sit beside her.  &#147;Are you going to allow it?&#148;
	&#147;Yes,&#148; answered Kaya.  &#147;I wasn&#146;t going to, and there&#146;s still a 
part of me that feels like this is too much, too fast.  But you should 
have seen them tonight.  When I told Ami I wanted her to wait, she 
fought me.  I shouldn&#146;t be happy about that.  I should be even less 
happy that it&#146;s Makoto&#146;s influence that led to it.  But it feels almost 
good to see something akin to a little teenage rebellion in her 
finally.&#148;  She sighed and turned to Ken, worry marring her features.  
Quietly she asked, &#147;Did I make a mistake?&#148;
	Ken reached over and placed a hand on Kaya&#146;s back.  He began 
stoking gently as he said, &#147;I can&#146;t answer that for you.  But I can say 
that I know you well enough to know that you don&#146;t make decisions 
lightly and that you always have a good reason for what you do.&#148;
	&#147;Makoto was very honest with me about things when we talked,&#148; 
replied Kaya after several seconds of thought.  She leaned back and let 
her head fall against the top of the couch.  &#147;I think she was a lonely 
child who grew into a confused teenager.  While I&#146;d prefer her 
confusion didn&#146;t involve my daughter, I do think she&#146;s begun to deal 
with it in a healthy manner.  And while I may have initially been 
concerned about her motives, I believe her when she says she loves Ami.  
I told you before I thought Makoto seemed very protective of her.  
That&#146;s still there, and I can see it even more clearly than before.  It 
makes me trust her, even if I do have a few concerns with it all.  But 
they have a chance to make this work for them.  I don&#146;t want to be the 
one that takes that chance away.  And as long as we&#146;re all on good 
terms with things, I can be there to keep an eye on them.  Make sure 
Ami doesn&#146;t make the same mistakes I did.&#148;
	A slow smile began to form on Kaya&#146;s lips.  &#147;I remember once, 
when Ami was a little girl, she told me that when she grew up she 
wanted a large family with lots of children.  At the time, I took it as 
a veiled request for siblings.  However she meant it, it looks like 
that&#146;s what she&#146;s getting now,&#148; said Kaya as she sat forward and turned 
on the couch so she was facing Ken.  She held her hands up in front of 
her, about two inches apart.  &#147;Because the way I figure it, one little 
version of Makoto is going to be the equivalent of about three of any 
other child.&#148;  She laughed lightly as she moved her hands further apart.  
&#147;They&#146;re going to have their hands full with that little boy.  And Ami 
is completely wrapped up in being his mother.&#148;
	At that, an odd looked crossed Kaya&#146;s face.  It was if she&#146;d just 
remembered something or realized some detail and it had left her 
seemingly confused.  Slowly, she said, &#147;My little girl is going to be 
someone&#146;s mother.  In a few months she&#146;s going to have a son, and I&#146;m 
going to be that child&#146;s grandmother.&#148;  Kaya closed her eyes and shook 
her head slightly, a hand coming up to rub at her temple.  &#147;Never mind 
what I said about Ami being too young for all of this.  *I&#146;m* too young 
for this.  I&#146;m only 43.  I can&#146;t be someone&#146;s grandmother.&#148;
	A deep chuckle greeted her actions, and Kaya opened one eye 
partway to glare at the man sitting across from her.
	&#147;Uh, hello, Mr. Sensitive,&#148; said Kaya through a scowl.  &#147;This 
isn&#146;t the part where you start laughing at me.  This is the part where 
you take me in your arms and tell me I&#146;m overreacting and that I am 
most definitely not old.&#148;
	Ken&#146;s smile widened as he reached forward to pull Kaya against 
him.  &#147;Better?&#148; he asked as she settled against his chest.
	&#147;Much,&#148; she answered.
	&#147;Now let&#146;s see,&#148; he teased.  &#147;I&#146;ve been told this is where I&#146;m 
supposed to tell you you&#146;re overreacting.  Experience, however, leads 
me to believe that would be a bad move.  So, instead,&#148; said Ken as he 
put a finger under Kaya&#146;s chin and tilted her head so she was looking 
up at him, &#147;I&#146;m just going to say that you aren&#146;t old.  Even if you 
were, you&#146;d still be the most beautiful woman I know.&#148;  He leaned down 
and kissed her lips softly.
	They parted, each wearing a happy grin.  Kaya turned and lay back 
so her head was resting in Ken&#146;s lap.  As Ken adjusted slightly and 
rested his feet up on the coffee table, Kaya took one of his hands in 
hers.  She spent several minutes just playing with his hand, matching 
their palms together, twining and untwining their fingers.
	Finally, she wondered absently, &#147;I wonder if this is how my 
mother felt when I put her through all of this?  I should give my 
parents a call; let them know what&#146;s going on.  I&#146;m honestly not sure 
how they&#146;re going to take it, and it will be easier on Ami if I break 
it to them first.  You know, I think I know, now, why my mom laughed 
when she found out I&#146;d had a girl.  &#145;She&#146;s going to be just like you,&#146;&#148; 
said Kaya with a chuckle as she remembered that moment.
	Ken looked down at her, glad to see her smiling, and brought her 
hands up to his lips.  He kissed them lightly, and when Kaya turned her 
smile solely to him, he said quietly, &#147;Marry me.&#148;
	Kaya sighed almost wearily and shook her head at the old proposal.  
&#147;I can only handle one life-crisis at a time, Ken.  And today my 
daughter beat you to it.&#148;
	His free hand stroking the hair that framed Kaya&#146;s face, Ken 
replied, &#147;All right, you get off the hook this time.  But I&#146;m going to 
get you to say yes one of these days, Mizuno Kaya.  You haven&#146;t got any 
more excuses.&#148;
	&#147;She hasn&#146;t moved out yet,&#148; replied Kaya.  Then, changing moods, 
she said cloyingly as she began playing with the buttons on the front 
of Ken&#146;s shirt, &#147;Speaking of Ami moving, do you have any plans for next 
Sunday?&#148;
	&#147;Nothing concrete,&#148; answered Ken.
	&#147;Would right now be a very bad time to ask for a favor?&#148;
	Ken pushed a lock of hair behind Kaya&#146;s ear.  &#147;You can ask,&#148; he 
said.
	&#147;Well, the girls have planned the move for next Sunday,&#148; began 
Kaya.  &#147;Now, far be it from me to ever tell them they can&#146;t do 
something simply because they&#146;re female.  In all honesty, though, 
they&#146;re a bunch of girls, and they can&#146;t move an entire apartment by 
themselves.  I considered hiring someone to help, but I&#146;m afraid Makoto 
would see it more as interference and lack of trust than anything 
helpful.  She&#146;s very proud, and they&#146;ve planned everything out very 
carefully.  I don&#146;t want to step on any toes this early in the game.
	&#147;So I was thinking,&#148; went on Kaya as she continued to toy with 
the front of Ken&#146;s shirt, &#147;if you offered to help me move Ami&#146;s things 
over to the new apartment, when we got there you could very gallantly 
offer to help move some of the other things as well.  I figure between 
you and Haruka we should be able to get most of the heavier furniture 
moved.  The rest of the girls can handle everything else.  Except for 
Makoto, of course.  She can&#146;t lift anything heavier than a shoebox, and 
she won&#146;t even be doing that if Ami has her way.&#148;
	Ken thought for a second, then said, &#147;All right, I&#146;ll help.  But 
on one condition.&#148;
	Kaya looked at him suspiciously.  &#147;And that would be?&#148;
	&#147;Go away with me for a few days.&#148;  He put a finger to her lips to 
stop the protest he saw coming.  &#147;I know you have the time, Kaya.  You 
need to take a real vacation, one that has nothing to do with any kind 
of work.  The girls can last a few days without you.  And believe it or 
not, so can the hospital.&#148;  He smirked at the look that got him, and 
pushed forward.  &#147;So, sometime in the next six months, you have to take 
a vacation with me.  That, or you&#146;ll be lifting furniture by yourself 
next weekend.&#148;
	Kaya nipped playfully at the finger resting on her lips.  &#147;Fine,&#148; 
she answered.  &#147;But not until I&#146;m certain the girls are properly 
settled in.&#148;
	Ken nodded his agreement.  &#147;That&#146;s all I&#146;m asking, Love.&#148;
	Admitting a small defeat, but not minding at all, Kaya resettled 
herself as Ken&#146;s fingers continued to move gently through her hair.  
Her eyes were beginning to droop when she noticed the novel lying 
beside Ken&#146;s feet.  She hadn&#146;t seen the title when he&#146;d met her at the 
door, but now that she could, her interest was piqued.
	&#147;When did you pick this up?&#148; asked Kaya as she reached over and 
picked up the book.  &#147;I thought the new one didn&#146;t come out until next 
week.&#148;
	&#147;Got it on the way home tonight,&#148; answered Ken.  &#147;Looks like it&#146;s 
going to be even more twisted than the last one, if you can believe 
that.&#148;
	Kaya smiled at him sweetly.  &#147;I don&#146;t suppose I could convince 
you start over again, could I?&#148;
	&#147;Possibly,&#148; replied Ken.
	&#147;How about if I throw in some hot chocolate?&#148;
	&#147;Then I can&#146;t refuse.&#148;
	&#147;Great,&#148; said Kaya as she got up off the couch.  &#147;I&#146;ll make the 
hot chocolate.  You go get comfortable.  And since it&#146;s my turn to read 
first, I&#146;ll just hold on to this.&#148;
	Ken chuckled as Kaya hurried off with his novel.  Before retiring 
to the bedroom, he listened for a moment as Kaya puttered around in the 
kitchen, opening and closing cabinet doors and fixing the kettle to 
boil water.  The knowledge of her presence alone left him with a warm 
and comfortable feeling, and if he could only have her for a night at a 
time, then he would be happy with that.  But one of these days he was 
going to convince her that a more permanent arrangement was better for 
both of them, regardless of schedules, families, or past mistakes.
