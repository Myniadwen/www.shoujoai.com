<h1>Kazeko (part 11 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Setsuna sat quietly on her bed, hands clasped in her lap and eyes 
closed.  She had taken off her suit and slipped into the simple white 
knee-length silky dress she wore to bed, the thought of the younger 
senshi halting her preparations for bed.  Was it right to deny the 
younger senshi their memories?  They had lives and loves back in the 
Silver Millennium, loves they sacrificed themselves for, loves they 
hoped to be with in their next lives.  Did she have the right to keep 
them from remembering that?
 
Ailan knocked on her door and entered the oldest senshi&#39;s room, having 
sensed her turmoil three rooms away in the guest room.  &quot;Setsu-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Come in, Ailan.  I was just thinking.&quot;
 
Ailan sat beside Setsuna on her large bed, resting her head on the 
taller woman&#39;s bare shoulder.  Ailan had changed out of the exquisite 
dress Setsuna had given her and into one of Haruka&#39;s long white dress 
shirts.  It was practically a dress on her, reaching nearly to her 
knees, and Setsuna realized just how much like the silver haired woman 
was like her blonde daughter.  All of Haruka&#39;s shirts were too big for 
Usagi.  Usagi looked and acted like the ancient queen.  &quot;But not like 
me.&quot;
 
&quot;Who?  Usagi?&quot;
 
Setsuna nodded, wrapping one arm around Ailan&#39;s waist as they leaned 
against the headboard of her bead.  &quot;She&#39;s nothing like me.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes she is.  On the outside she may look like me, and she may be a 
little flighty and a bit of a klutz now and then, but inside, her heart, 
is you.  Do you remember leaving the Moon?  You left because you loved 
our daughter so much that nothing else mattered.  I couldn&#39;t have ever 
done that.&quot;
 
&quot;Serenity&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;Setsuna, listen.  Her heart, her strength, her capacity for love, is 
from you.  I expected her to look like me, all daughters of the Moon 
Kingdom look similar.  But when she gets determined, she looks like you.  
When she smiles kindly at her enemies or her friends, she looks like 
you.  When she smiles that mysterious little smile because she knows 
everything will turn out alright, that&#39;s all you.  I don&#39;t have your 
strength, Love, but she does.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna whispered.  &quot;How long have you been watching her?&quot;
 
&quot;A long, long time.&quot;  She closed her lavender eyes, sighing softly.  
&quot;Would you . . . would you have even noticed me if I wasn&#39;t the Moon 
Princess?&quot;
 
Setsuna laughed, kissing Ailan&#39;s forehead before answering.  &quot;I didn&#39;t 
even know who you were when I first saw you.  It was so long ago, there 
was a party on Jupiter and you were wearing a silky pink dress covered 
in flowers.  It moved with the slightest breeze.  I had no idea who you 
were, but I fell for you in an instant.  I wasn&#39;t even Sailor Pluto yet.  
It was years before the ball on the Moon where we first spoke, and I 
wasn&#39;t even going to speak to you once I learned that you were the 
princess.  I knew we had no chance, but I was determined to meet you.&quot;
 
&quot;Good thing for Usagi you found your courage.&quot;  Ailan leaned up and 
kissed Setsuna gently.  &quot;And good thing for me, too.&quot;
 
&quot;No matter how little time we had together back then, I never regretted 
my choice.&quot;
 
&quot;Then, since I&#39;m only going to be here for a little while, could we . . 
. could you . . . could we be in love again?  Just for now?&quot;
 
Setsuna smiled at her partner, turning to face the silver-haired woman.  
&quot;I have never stopped loving you,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I never will.&quot;
 
&quot;I wish you could, Setsu-chan.  You deserve to be happy with someone who 
can stay.  You&#39;ve been alone for centuries and I don&#39;t want you to be 
alone any more.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m not with you here,&quot; Setsuna whispered.
 
&quot;Setsuna!  I&#39;m not going to be here forever and you need to find someone 
to love, someone who can be by your side.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ve loved a queen; who else could ever compare?&quot;  Ailan turned away, 
tears in her eyes, and Setsuna caught her chin, turning the woman back.  
&quot;Look, I have been alone since the Silver Millennium.  Alone.  I had so 
many chances, but I was never tempted.  Ever since I first saw you at 
the party on Mokusei, no one has ever come near my heart.  I loved you, 
I love you, and I will always love you.  Only you.  No matter what you 
say, I could never give my heart to another because it no longer belongs 
to me.  I gave it to you and I don&#39;t want it back.&quot;
 
Ailan wiped her tears away.  &quot;That was beautiful,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I 
wish I was good enough for you; I wish I could be here forever, like you 
deserve.&quot;  She placed her fingers over Setsuna&#39;s lips, knowing her 
beloved&#39;s thoughts.  &quot;You don&#39;t have to say anything.  Back in the 
Silver Millennium, if I could have had just one wish, one wish in the 
whole world, I would have asked for you.  I would have been a servant on 
Pluto or a commoner on the Moon, so long as my position didn&#39;t keep me 
away from you.  Life isn&#39;t fair for us, for two old queens, but we have 
some time, at least.  I never thought we&#39;d have this much.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t regret what little time we have.&quot;  Ailan&#39;s sad purple eyes 
looked up at Setsuna, and the green-haired woman kissed her, aching to 
be with her one and only lover once more.  For the first time in her 
long guardianship as Sailor Pluto, Setsuna didn&#39;t care about the 
consequences&#151;she was going to make love to Ailan.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka pushed Michiru onto their bed, their locked lips pulling her, 
too.  They had made love before and they had shared a bed for years, but 
tonight was different.  They were married now, they had an eternity to 
spend together, and no one would ever again question their devotion to 
each other.  Besides, the Inner Senshi had forced them to sleep in 
different rooms for the past week to prepare for their wedding, and 
Haruka was sick and tired of sleeping alone as a bachelor on Makoto&#39;s 
couch.  She wanted to show Michiru how much she had missed her.  She 
could feel the slight woman wiggling slightly to get into position, and 
she gasped into Michiru&#39;s mouth as her lover&#39;s hands found their target.
 
Haruka suddenly realized that she wanted to give Michiru something more.  
She knew that the aqua-haired woman had a wish so deep in her soul that 
she could never tell her lover, and Haruka wanted nothing more than to 
find a way to grant it.  They were married now and there was something 
that her wife deserved.  And she . . . almost . . . remembered how to 
grant that wish.
 
Haruka felt the power of her planet run through her in a much more 
intimate way than when she blasted enemies as Sailor Uranus, and she 
felt something inside her take that power and channel it, altering and 
refining as she sensed an answering surge of energy from Michiru.  The 
power left her and arrowed toward Michiru, wrapping around the smaller 
woman and slipping inside her, escaping from Haruka&#39;s grasp.  The two 
women gasped, neither sure what had happened, as energy exploded through 
the room.
 
Haruka collapsed, panting, Michiru trapped beneath her, as the light and 
the sudden burst of exquisite pleasure faded.  &quot;Michi?&quot;
 
&quot;What was that, Ruka?&quot;  Her wife&#39;s voice was soft and trembling, very 
uncharacteristic for the senshi of the seas.
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know what that light was, but the rest was incredible.&quot;  
Michiru snorted as Haruka rolled to one side and pulled the smaller 
woman into her arms.  &quot;Are you okay?&quot;
 
Michiru nodded, resting her head on Haruka&#39;s breast, letting her wife&#39;s 
steadying heartbeat calm her.  &quot;I think so.  I feel a little drained, 
and I&#39;d like to know what that light show was.  I didn&#39;t know we could 
do anything like that with our powers.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know about you, but I, for one, was not in control.  It&#39;s like 
Uranus took over and just used my body as a vessel to do what she wanted 
to.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  I tried to stop, to pull away, but I couldn&#39;t.  It was 
incredible, the most incredible experience in my life, but I wasn&#39;t in 
the driver&#39;s seat.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;It seems so strange for me to be the 
one talking about cars.&quot;
 
Haruka chose to ignore that comment as she moved into a more comfortable 
position and readjusted her arms around her wife, pulling the blanket up 
higher.  &quot;It almost seemed&#151;I don&#39;t know&#151;familiar, somehow.&quot;
 
&quot;I know . . . I felt . . . Neptune remembers something like this before, 
and she was a little . . . she is worried.  This doesn&#39;t make any sense, 
and she won&#39;t tell me.&quot;
 
&quot;It makes sense,&quot; Haruka whispered, her breathing slowing.  &quot;I&#39;m so 
tired, Michi . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Me, too, Ruka.  I think, after today, we deserve some rest.&quot;  She 
closed her eyes, and both women were asleep moments later.
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna gasped as she shot out of bed, leaning against the window to let 
her blood stop pounding in her ears.  Realizing that she was naked, 
Setsuna slipped her robe on and sank to the floor, glancing up to make 
sure her shock did not wake her lover.  The green-haired senshi glanced 
at her hands, unable to comprehend the newest consequences of her choice 
so long ago.  She had vowed never to let the senshi remember, to never 
let them relive that pain, but now the Outers who had defied everything 
to be together were testing that vow.  They had tried to combine their 
powers again!  It was forbidden!  There was a seal on the planets to 
keep the incident with Helios from happening again, but it must have 
eroded over the centuries.  Pluto wondered if her power was fading&#151;the 
seal should still be strong.  The planets knew better than to combine 
their powers and the senshi should, too!
 
How could they know, she asked herself bitingly, if they remember 
nothing of their pasts?  They&#39;ll keep doing it again and again, and you 
can&#39;t restore that damn seal if the senshi are alive and drawing power 
from their planets!  One day they&#39;ll succeed and Michiru will get 
pregnant.  Again.  You cannot allow that a second time.  Setsuna snorted 
at her inner voice.  As if I allowed it the first time!  Anyway, how do 
I stop it?  How do I prevent the conception of another child of two 
senshi?  Usagi and Helios must remain unique, but Haruka and Michiru 
love each other too much to stop willingly, and they don&#39;t remember how 
to control their planets.  Then there is only one choice.
 
Return their memories.
 
Before she had time to convince herself to stop or find another way to 
achieve her goal, Setsuna summoned the Time Staff to her side and pulled 
her Garnet Orb into her hands.  Closing her ruby eyes, Setsuna wrapped 
her fingers around the smooth orb, her talisman.  It warmed to her 
touch, and she smiled as its radiant energy filled her strong frame.  
There was no confusion, no question of her true path when she held the 
orb, and it took a moment to remind her that she had not released its 
powers in years.  Life made perfect sense when she held the orb, and she 
knew that her choice was the right one.  Focusing that power, Setsuna 
reached into the past, into the last glorious days of the Silver 
Millennium.  &quot;Let them remember,&quot; she whispered, wind filling her room 
and whispering secrets of time that only she knew.  &quot;Nine lonely 
planets, one mother star, a lifetime ago they knew the truth.  Let them 
now know what they did, let them see that truth once more.  Let them 
remember the Silver Millennium.&quot;</pre>
