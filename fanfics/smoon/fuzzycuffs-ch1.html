<h1>Fuzzy Handcuffs</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: This story contains light bondage (Oh my God, NOOOOOO!), 
so if that offends you, please read no further.

Also, this gets a bit silly at times, so if you&#39;re looking for some 
serious hardcore stuff, you&#39;re down on your luck.

------

The door to the Outer&#39;s mansion opened as Setsuna, dressed in a 
fashionable bridesmaid dress, entered the home followed by flower girls 
Hotaru and Chibi-Usa. All three were smiling as they removed their 
shoes.

&quot;Oh, Setsuna-mama,&quot; Hotaru sighed dreamily, &quot;Wasn&#39;t the wedding 
beautiful?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the Time Senshi agreed, &quot;Michiru certainly looked beautiful in 
her bride&#39;s dress, and I can&#39;t remember the last time your Haruka-papa 
looked quite so handsome.&quot;

Chibi Usa was about to say something as well, when she remembered 
something, &quot;Hotaru,&quot; she said as she tugged on her best friend&#39;s sleeve, 
&quot;Do you mind if I turn on the TV? I want to see if any of the Saturday 
morning cartoon shows are still on.&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; Hotaru said, &quot;You go right ahead, while Setsuna-mama 
and I go upstairs and change.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; the cute pink-haired girl said as the two Outers began to head 
for the stairs. Chibi Usa turned the TV on, and frowned when she saw 
that the kid&#39;s programming was being interrupted by a special news 
announcement.

&quot;We interrupt your normally scheduled programming for this important 
news story. It seems the International Astronomers Union, or IAU, has 
passed a monumental ruling concerning the number of planets in our solar 
system...&quot;

Setsuna stopped dead in her tracks as she turned to look at the TV 
screen.

------

The two entered the honeymoon suite they rented at the elegant hotel, 
carrying their luggage and a few of the wedding gifts their friends gave 
them. Shutting the door, they embraced lovingly.

Michiru kissed Haruka warmly, relishing the feel of her lips, her breath 
against her cheek, her tongue. Pulling back from the kiss, she rested 
her head on the blonde&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; she said happily, &quot;My Haruka, my love, my wife.&quot;

&quot;Wife,&quot; the racecar driver murmured, feelings of love filling her as she 
held the slightly shorter woman close. After holding one another for 
several minutes, she spoke up, &quot;Well, I suppose we should unpack.&quot;

&quot;Hmm? Oh, right,&quot; Michiru said with a light chuckle as the two broke 
away from one another and went to their luggage. As they started sorting 
things out, Michiru noticed one of the wedding gifts lying on the bed, 
&quot;Ruka,&quot; she called over as she picked it up, &quot;Wasn&#39;t this Minako&#39;s 
gift?&quot;

&quot;What? Oh, yeah, I think it was. Why?&quot;

&quot;Well, she asked us to open it first.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Haruka asked, &quot;Well open it then.&quot;

Michiru began to unwrap the gift, and stopped cold when she got a good 
look at what it was. Her new wife, noticing the look on the artist&#39;s 
face, came over to take a look for herself. Her eyes widened as she 
looked at the box as well.

&quot;You&#39;re kidding me,&quot; the blonde gasped.

------

&quot;You&#39;re kidding me,&quot; Setsuna gasped as she stared at the newsman on the 
television.

&quot;...Yes, after a vote in which four-hundred and twenty-four astronomers 
took part, the IAU has declared Pluto is no longer a planet. There are 
now officially only eight planets in the solar system. The highly 
controversial decision is being hailed as &#39;a triumph of scientific 
reasoning over popular belief.&#39;&quot;

&quot;They got rid of Puu&#39;s planet?&quot; Chibi Usa asked.

&quot;Usagi believes Pluto is a Planet,&quot; Hotaru answered defensively, &quot;And 
since she&#39;s the future queen, she overrules those astronomy dorks, right 
Setsuna-mama? Setsuna-mama?&quot; Hotaru asked as she noticed how all the 
blood seemed to drain from the Time Senshi&#39;s face.

&quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; the statuesque woman said, &quot;I&#39;m... Going out a bit. Can 
you stay here and watch Small Lady?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; the Senshi of Death asked, &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot;

&quot;Good&quot; Setsuna answered as she headed for the door. Putting her coat and 
shoes on, she rushed out of the mansion. Both girls left in the living 
room turned to one another.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Chibi Usa said, &quot;Puu seemed pretty upset, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll say,&quot; Hotaru agreed, adding, &quot;She didn&#39;t even bother to take her 
bridesmaid&#39;s dress off before leaving.&quot;

------

&quot;What in the world was Minako-chan thinking?&quot; Michiru asked as she 
pulled a pair of handcuffs out of the gift box, &quot;I mean, fuzzy 
handcuffs? A blindfold? A large paddle and... What is this?&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s called a ball gag,&quot; Haruka answered, &quot;Look, you know 
Minako-chan. I&#39;ll bet this is her idea of a joke gift. You know, like 
fake vomit.&quot;

&quot;Humph, I suppose. Knowing her, she was probably giggling the whole time 
she was buying it.&quot;

A moment of silence passed between the two as they stared at the box&#39;s 
contents. Then, slowly, the corner of Haruka&#39;s lip curled up into a 
smirk.

&quot;You know,&quot; she began, &quot;We are alone on our honeymoon. It&#39;s not like 
anyone would ever know...&quot;

&quot;Are you seriously suggesting...&quot;

&quot;Come on, it might be fun.&quot;

Michiru looked from her new wife back at the box, &quot;No &#39;ball gag,&#39; 
right?&quot;

&quot;What? No, of course not.&quot;

&quot;(sigh) Fine, just this once. Give me your hands,&quot; Michiru said as she 
pulled out the handcuffs.

&quot;What? Why do I have to be handcuffed first?&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#39;t want to be first, and besides,&quot; she said as she batted 
her eyes and gave Haruka her most charming smile, &quot;It was your idea.&quot;

The two stared at one another in a silent battle of wills. Finally, the 
blonde smiled back.

&quot;Rocks, scissors, paper?&quot; the racecar driver asked.

&quot;You&#39;re on!&quot; Michiru answered.

------

&quot;Tttthooose s-s-stupid old j-jerks and their as-astronomer&#39;s u-u-union!&quot; 
Setsuna slurred out as she took another sip of the drink in front of 
her, &quot;Wh-Whoooo th&#39; hell d&#39; they thiiiink th-they are, anyways? Pluto&#39;s 
no l-l-longer a plaaaanet my ass!&quot;

&quot;Hey, lady,&quot; the bartender asked out of concern, &quot;How many of those have 
you had already?&quot;

&quot;Three,&quot; the Time Senshi answered, adding &quot;I&#39;m n-not much of a drinker.&quot;

------

&quot;Okay Michiru, are you comfortable?&quot;

&quot;Well, as comfortable as a person handcuffed to a bed blindfolded can 
be.&quot;

&quot;Can you see?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;You sure?&quot;

&quot;Yes, now just get on with it,&quot; Michiru said as she tightened her 
muscles up and held her breath, waiting for the paddle to come in 
contact with her rear end. After several seconds, she noticed that her 
lover had become very quiet.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; she called out. There was no answer. &quot;Haruka,&quot; she said a bit 
louder. Again, no answer. By this time, the artist was starting to 
become annoyed, &quot;If that baka left me here alone in this room handcuffed 
to this stupid box-spring in my birthday suit...&quot;

WHACK!

&quot;Ow!&quot;

&quot;Ha! I got you totally off guard!&quot; Haruka declared triumphantly.

&quot;Ouch, hey that really hurt! And you&#39;re supposed to give me a warning 
you jerk.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but isn&#39;t the whole point of the blindfold to keep you from 
knowing when it&#39;s coming?&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Besides, it&#39;s all in fun, remember?&quot;

&quot;I suppose, I...&quot;

WHACK!

&quot;Ow!&quot;

&quot;He, he, got you again.&quot;

&quot;Okay, that&#39;s it; no more with the paddle!&quot; Michiru said angrily, &quot;That 
really stings, you know.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm... On the box it says it&#39;s supposed to be &#39;painfully erotic.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just painful, and...&quot; her voice drifted off 
as she felt a new sensation on her bare rear. The corners of her lips 
drew up into a smile as Haruka gently caressed her behind with her hand.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; the blonde said, &quot;Tell you what, forget the whole pain 
thing. Instead, while I have you at my mercy,&quot; she said, lowering her 
voice as she softly reached up to stroke Michiru&#39;s cheek, &quot;Why don&#39;t we 
concentrate more on the erotic, hmm?&quot;

The artist smiled wider at that, as Haruka continued to rub her rear 
end. The blond then helped turn Michiru onto her back, and brought her 
lips to the aqua-haired beauty&#39;s as her hands found her partner&#39;s full 
breasts. As Michiru moaned softly into her love&#39;s mouth, one of Haruka&#39;s 
hands began to travel southward.

Several intense minutes later, the blonde undid her partner&#39;s handcuffs, 
removed her blindfold, and pulled her into a tender embrace. Michiru 
sighed happily as Haruka ran her fingers through her wavy locks. As the 
blonde kissed the smaller Senshi on her forehead, Michiru looked into 
her green eyes.

&quot;So,&quot; the artist said with a smirk, &quot;Are you ready for your turn?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve been looking forward to this, haven&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Uh huh.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going to regret using that paddle, aren&#39;t I?&quot;

Michiru didn&#39;t answer, instead laughing a bit as she reached over to the 
nearby dresser where Haruka had put the handcuffs.

------

&quot;Look lady,&quot; the bouncer said as he led Setsuna out of the bar, &quot;You 
look like you&#39;ve had too much to drink. You want me to call a cab or...&quot;

&quot;N-n-no, thank yo-you,&quot; the school nurse said as she turned and started 
to stumble her way down the sidewalk. Thanks to those jerks at the IAU 
she no longer had a planet to call her home. She was depressed and, by 
now, quite intoxicated.

&quot;I c-can&#39;t go hoooooome l-like this,&quot; she mumbled to herself, fearing 
how her inebriated state might affect Hotaru and Chibi-Usa. This of 
course made her feel like a bad parent and baby-sitter, which made her 
even more depressed. As the Time Senshi started to cry, she reached into 
her pocket for a handkerchief. Instead she found a note written by 
Michiru with their hotel number and a phone number they could be reached 
at in case of trouble.

Setsuna looked at the note closely, then headed off into a side alley.

&quot;P-P-Pluto puh-planet powwwer, Make-up!&quot;

------

&quot;Hold on... Just a bit... There,&quot; Michiru said triumphantly as she 
finished adjusting Haruka&#39;s blindfold. The blonde was lying on her back, 
her hands handcuffed just as the artist&#39;s were to the bed frame. Michiru 
then began to softly run her nails across Haruka&#39;s abdomen, smiling as 
the blonde moaned a bit under her touch. She then bent down and kissed 
the racecar driver, lightly at first, but then deepening it as the two 
lost themselves in the moment. After a few seconds, she pulled back.

&quot;Haruka-kun,&quot; she said as she gently ran her index finger around her 
love&#39;s mouth, &quot;No offense to Minako-chan, but I&#39;m not sure this whole 
&#39;bondage&#39; thing is for me.&quot;

Haruka let out a bit of a sigh, &quot;I hear you,&quot; she admitted, &quot;It&#39;s just 
not the same without your arms around me, or mine around you.&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; the artist answered, &quot;Besides, we&#39;ve been together this long 
without doing anything like this...&quot;

&quot;Okay, okay. We&#39;ll just thank Minako for the gift when we see her again, 
and then we&#39;ll throw the junk away. Maybe some kinky homeless person 
will find it and it&#39;ll make their day.&quot;

They both laughed at that. Michiru then bent over and kissed Haruka 
again. As they seperated, the blonde spoke up, &quot;Well, if it&#39;s settled, 
undo my handcuffs and...&quot;

&quot;Not so fast.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t really think I was going to let you off the hook for the 
paddle so easily, did you?&quot;

&quot;Oh boy... Michiru, it was all in fun. I was just trying it out, and...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; the artist answered impishly, &quot;And now, there&#39;s something I 
want to try out.&quot;

Before Haruka could respond, she felt something wet drip between her 
breasts. As Michiru blew a bit on the wet spot, Haruka arched her back 
and let out a gasp as she suddenly felt the area becoming warmer.

&quot;So,&quot; Michiru purred, &quot;How does that feel?&quot;

&quot;Mmmmmm... What is that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s a special massage oil that I packed in my suitcase for us. It 
warms the skin when you blow on it. Do you like it?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm, it feels nice.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you like it,&quot; the artist said, &quot;Here, let me put a little bit 
more on... Oops!&quot; she cried out as Haruka suddenly felt something wet 
splashing against her entire chest.

&quot;Oops?&quot; the blonde asked uneasily, &quot;What do you mean &#39;oops?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Haruka-kun, don&#39;t panic...&quot;

&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t panic?&#39; Michiru, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Well, the silly thing accidentally slipped in my hands and I spilled it 
all over you.&quot;

&quot;You what? I...&quot; the racecar driver&#39;s voice drifted off as a burning 
sensation started to take hold of her, &quot;Aaaaa! This shit hurts!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! Look, it&#39;s water based, so I&#39;ll just undo your handcuffs, 
you can run into the shower and... Ut-oh.&quot;

&quot;What now?&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t seem to find the key to the handcuffs.&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;Now Haruka love, don&#39;t be alarmed.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be... My tits are on fire and you&#39;re telling me not to be 
alarmed?&quot;

&quot;Okay, hold on. I&#39;ll run into the bathroom and get a wet washcloth.&quot;

&quot;Alright, anything! I... What&#39;s that noise?&quot; the blindfolded Senshi of 
the Air asked as the time gate suddenly appeared in the honeymoon suite.

&quot;Setsuna!&quot; Michiru shrieked as she quickly covered herself and Haruka 
with a blanket, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Th-they took away my planet!&quot; the bitter Senshi wept, &quot;Th-those 
stuuupid astro-astro... Those guys that look at stars! They g-got rid of 
P-Pluuuuto!&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t happening,&quot; Haruka groaned from both pain and embarrassment. 
Sailor Pluto walked wobbly over to the bound woman.

&quot;Haaaaruka?&quot; she asked, &quot;A-Are you aw-aware that you&#39;re h-h-handcuffed 
to a bed with aaaaaaaaa l-l-leather blindfold on.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; the blonde answered sarcastically, &quot;Gee, thanks. I knew there 
was something wrong, but until now I couldn&#39;t put my finger on it.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-chan?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;Have you been drinking?&quot;

&quot;Welllll...&quot;

&quot;Okay, look,&quot; Haruka interrupted, &quot;Michiru and I were playing around and 
she handcuffed me to this bed...&quot;

&quot;R-r-really? Are you un-under arrest?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Michiru answered, &quot;Like Haruka said, we were just playing around. 
But now we&#39;ve lost the key to the handcuffs.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and Michiru then poured lighter fluid on my nipples and set them 
ablaze...&quot;

&quot;I did not!&quot; the artist answered back defensively, &quot;It was a massage 
oil...&quot;

&quot;Same difference!&quot; the angry blonde answered back, &quot;Look, as long as 
you&#39;re here, could you help Michiru look for the key so I can run to the 
shower and wash this junk off?&quot;

&quot;Key?&quot; Sailor Pluto asked as she swayed in place, &quot;K-k-key? We don&#39;t 
need no stinking key!&quot; she declared as she held up her time staff.

&quot;Setsuna-chan!&quot; Michiru cried, &quot;No, wait!&quot;

&quot;N-now hold still,&quot; Sailor Pluto stammered out as she aimed her staff at 
where Haruka&#39;s hands were handcuffed together, &quot;Th-this won&#39;t hurt a 
b-b-bit.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna?&quot; the blonde asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on? I...&quot;

&quot;Duh-D-Dead Scream!&quot;

-KA-BOOM!-

Michiru was thrown off the bed by the force of the blast, landing hard 
on her rear end. As she looked up, she could see through the plaster 
dust in the air the remains of the demolished bed and a large hole in 
the wall behind where the headboard once stood. As she watched through 
the hole as the occupants in the next room over ran out in fear for 
their lives, a hand emerged from the rubble with a broken handcuff 
hanging from its wrist.

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Michiru shrieked, running to help her wife out of the rubble 
as Sailor Pluto blew on the end of her time staff like a gunfighter 
blowing the smoke away from a gun barrel.

&quot;N-N-No need to th-thank me,&quot; the Time Senshi said as a disheveled 
Haruka stood up and pulled her blindfold off.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;Are you alright? I...&quot;

&quot;Michiru,&quot; the blonde interrupted, &quot;I&#39;m going to the bathroom now. You 
get dressed, and try to come up with a logical explanation why part of 
our room blew up for when the hotel manager comes up here. By that time 
I should be done with my shower.&quot;

&quot;A-a-and whaaat do you want m-me to do?&quot; Sailor Pluto asked.

&quot;Turn back into Setsuna, go downstairs into the hotel&#39;s restaurant, and 
start ordering lots and lots of coffee,&quot; Haruka answered, adding, &quot;And 
as far as you, Michiru and I are concerned, none of this ever happened. 
Got that?&quot;

&quot;Rog-Roger,&quot; the Time Senshi answered as she gave a military salute 
before transforming into her regular clothes again and heading out of 
the room through the door. Michiru was about to go to her suitcase to 
get dressed before the inevitable hotel personnel would arrive to check 
up on the disturbance, when Haruka called to her from the bathroom door.

&quot;Michiru-chan,&quot; she began, &quot;The next time I suggest we try something 
different just for fun...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Just tell me to shut up,&quot; she said as she went in to wash the massage 
oil off.
