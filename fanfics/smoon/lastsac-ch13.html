----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;My father called us to the throne room,&quot; Makoto informed her partner, 
an inexplicable fear in her green eyes.  &quot;He&#39;s not going to want to let 
me go home with you.&quot;
 
&quot;Do you want us to go with you?&quot;
 
Makoto looked over at Haruka, holding Ami&#39;s hand.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what 
good you can do.  If they won&#39;t let me go to Suisei&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;Then you can leave when they&#39;re not looking.  Don&#39;t worry so muck, 
Mako-chan; they can&#39;t keep you here forever.  They think I&#39;m Urakaze 
Haruka, your sword-instructor, right?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.  Why?&quot;
 
&quot;They respect me as him.  I&#39;m sure I could help out a little.  Michiru 
must have some sway over them, and you can tell them the story of your 
servant seeing my mother.  We can convince them to let you fly free.&quot;  
Haruka turned to Kiyoshi while the Princess of Mokusei considered her 
friend&#39;s words.  &quot;Kiyoshi-kun, why don&#39;t you go on ahead to Suisei like 
we planned?  You probably should leave before her parents figure out why 
you&#39;re here.  We&#39;ll see you when we get there.&quot;  Yoruno Kiyoshi nodded 
and headed for the transport room.
 
Makoto looked at Ami, and her gaze softened.  &quot;Okay.  We&#39;ll try 
anything.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
King Kino Meisha and Queen Kino Meika of Mokusei were waiting for their 
only daughter when she entered with her blue-haired lover, the 
aqua-haired princess of Kaiousei, and a tall, blonde man wearing a 
beautifully decorated sword.  The latter three bowed to Jupiter&#39;s 
rulers, but Makoto glared at her parents.  &quot;Why did you call me here?&quot;
 
&quot;We hear that you plan to accompany your friend back to Suisei.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  What of it?  She did us the honor of visiting our fine palace; 
why should I not return the courtesy?&quot;
 
Meika sighed and leaned forward, her emerald-studded crown sparkling in 
the light.  &quot;We know why you really want to go to Suisei.  You know that 
you have to marry soon, and your three brothers have been kind enough to 
find some very promising young Dukes.&quot;
 
Makoto wrinkled her nose.  &quot;I hated them all, Mother.  You know that, 
too.  I appreciate their efforts, but those guys just aren&#39;t my type.&quot;
 
&quot;Your type has to be applicable to men, child.  You can&#39;t spend the rest 
of your life with Ami-chan.&quot;
 
&quot;You were almost twice my age when you finally married.&quot;
 
Meika leaned back, clenching and unclenching her hands nervously.  
&quot;Don&#39;t exaggerate.&quot;
 
&quot;I wasn&#39;t.  Until Mizuno Amami&#39;s wedding, you stayed single and away 
from all men.&quot;  Makoto silently thanked Haruka&#39;s research for the 
valuable information.  &quot;Why can&#39;t I wait a little longer for marriage?&quot;
 
Meika and Meisha exchanged glances, the king shaking his head.  Haruka 
cleared her throat and bowed a moment before speaking.  &quot;Majesties, 
these two were blessed recently by the spirit of Ten&#39;ou Kazeko when I 
was visiting your fine palace.  She meant for them not to make the 
mistake she and Kaiou Shousha made so very long ago.&quot;
 
That got Meika&#39;s attention.  Her eyes, the exact same color as Makoto&#39;s, 
widened, realizing what Haruka meant.  &quot;Shousha?  Why was Kazeko here?&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps she&#39;s looking out for these young princesses.&quot;
 
Michiru chose that moment to voice her opinion.  &quot;Meika-san, they&#39;re 
still young.  There is always time left for marriage and heirs.  They 
need to be with other Senshi anyway while they&#39;re learning to fight and 
control their powers.  You know how important partnership is.&quot;
 
Meika descended her dais, walking up to Ami and looking at the 
short-haired girl.  &quot;You look like Amami.&quot;
 
&quot;Father tells me that a lot.&quot;
 
Meika took Ami&#39;s hand and smiled.  &quot;You&#39;re so sweet and innocent.  Try 
to remember that the love between Senshi may be powerful but it must 
eventually be sacrificed.  You never have to say goodbye, though.  I 
never really lost her.&quot;
 
&quot;I know,&quot; Ami whispered.  &quot;The only thing I remember about my mother is 
when she told me that there are two different types of love&#151;eternal and 
necessary.  She told me not to forsake one for the other.  In her 
diaries she spoke of you often.&quot;
 
&quot;You want to be just like her, don&#39;t you?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
 
Meika embraced the shorter Senshi and returned to her throne.  &quot;Have a 
good trip, Mako-chan, and remember to say goodbye to your brothers.&quot;
 
&quot;Thank-you, mother.&quot;  The four bowed before leaving, Haruka taking 
Michiru&#39;s hand as the two followed Mercury and Jupiter.
 
Meika looked at her husband and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Urakaze Haruka is 
with Kaiou Michiru.  Did you hear about Shousha&#39;s daughter having a 
boyfriend?&quot;
 
Meisha shrugged.  &quot;I have no idea.  Shall we call her?&quot;
 
&quot;Not until after Michiru&#39;s birthday.  We&#39;ve been invited, so we can 
speak to her in person.&quot;
 
&quot;Okay.  Do you think Makoto will be okay?&quot;
 
&quot;What could possibly happen?  Two women can&#39;t disrupt our family lines.  
Let them live and love before they have to rule.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Ken-chan!  Ei-chan!  Sai-chan!  Hayaku!&quot;
 
Three young men, one taller than Haruka and Makoto, one the same height 
as Makoto, and one about Michiru&#39;s height, dashed into the room, rushing 
to embrace their sister.  &quot;There you are, Mako-chan!  We got home 
yesterday and you weren&#39;t here.  We went into the city to perform our 
princely duties and have only just returned.  It&#39;s been months, 
imouto-chan.&quot;
 
Makoto smiled at the tallest boy, hugging him again.  &quot;Ken-chan!  You 
could have just called me!  You promised to, anyway.&quot;
 
The prince, Makoto&#39;s older brother, grinned sheepishly.  &quot;We had a lot 
to do for your sake, little sister.  When you&#39;re queen, we&#39;ll be your 
faithful servants, and we have to know all about the rest of the 
kingdom.&quot;
 
Makoto smiled as she pulled her three brothers forward.  &quot;Min&#39;na, these 
are my brothers.  This is Ken&#39;nin, my older brother, Eiki, my older 
younger brother, and Saiki, my youngest brother.  Guys, this is Ami, 
Haruka-kun, and Michiru-san.&quot;
 
&quot;Dozo yoroshiku onegaishimasu,&quot; all six greeted simultaneously as they 
bowed to each other.  Michiru chuckled at their timing, and Ken&#39;nin 
smiled.
 
&quot;It is nice to meet you at last, Ami-san.  Mako-chan has told us all a 
lot about you.&quot;
 
&quot;Ken-chan, I&#39;m afraid I have to leave you guys again.&quot;
 
&quot;Nani?  Mako-chan, we only just got back.&quot;  Saiki, arms crossed, glared 
at his sister, the deep green eyes common to Makoto and her siblings 
piercing his sister&#39;s thoughts.  &quot;Why do you have to go away again?&quot;
 
&quot;Gomen&#39;ne, Sai-chan, but I want to go stay with Ami on Suisei for a 
while.&quot;  Her eyes begged her brothers to understand, and Eiki rested his 
hand on Makoto&#39;s shoulder.
 
&quot;It won&#39;t be for very long, and we can visit you.  It&#39;s not your fault 
we were gone while you were here.  Go to Suisei, Mako-chan, and have 
fun.&quot;
 
Makoto embraced her brothers again, sighing when Saiki relented and 
hugged her.  &quot;Okay, Mako-chan, but don&#39;t leave us alone for very long.  
We&#39;re pretty much helpless without you.&quot;
 
Ami and Makoto went to gather the last of their belongings, leaving 
Michiru and Haruka alone with the Kino brothers.  Haruka tilted her head 
at Ken&#39;nin, smiling slightly.  &quot;Perhaps if I had brothers like you, I 
wouldn&#39;t have run away from home.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-kun, right?  Why did you run away?&quot;
 
&quot;To meet Michiru,&quot; Haruka answered honestly.  &quot;I visited Mokusei on the 
way.  I taught your sister a few things about sword fighting and obeying 
her feelings.  She was kind enough to teach me about the Senshi.&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re so familiar with Michiru-san.  Are you dating?&quot;
 
Michiru looked up at Haruka, and the same thought crossed both minds.  
&quot;We aren&#39;t allowed to reveal our relationship until Michiru&#39;s birthday 
in a few days.  If you can keep a secret, we&#39;re married already.  
Makoto-san, Ami-san, Rei-san, Minako-san, and Serenity-san were there 
three days ago.  Shousha-sama will announce our marriage on Michiru&#39;s 
birthday.&quot;
 
&quot;The wedding was her idea, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;
 
&quot;You know my mother very well, Eiki-kun.  Yes, it was.  That doesn&#39;t 
mean that we didn&#39;t want it, only that we would perhaps have waited a 
bit longer.&quot;
 
Eiki and Saiki looked up as Makoto and Ami returned to the room, while 
Ken&#39;nin wondered for a moment longer whom Haruka looked like.  Then he 
smiled and kissed Makoto&#39;s forehead and hugged Ami once.  &quot;Take care of 
our sister,&quot; Ken&#39;nin whispered.
 
&quot;I will,&quot; Ami promised.  Eiki and Saiki also embraced the blue-haired 
Senshi and stood back, watching as Makoto and Ami pulled out their 
henshin sticks, gesturing for Haruka and Michiru to join them beside 
their pile of luggage.  Haruka slipped her hand into her pocket and 
touched her henshin stick, lending power to the other two Senshi as all 
four disappeared.
 
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot;
 
&quot;What, Ken-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;The necklace Haruka-kun was wearing,&quot; Ken&#39;nin explained, facing Eiki 
and Saiki.  &quot;Did you see it?  A topaz inscribed with the symbol of 
Uranus?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, sure,&quot; Saiki shrugged.  &quot;What of it?  Mako-chan&#39;s message to us 
weeks ago said that Urakaze Haruka was some Duke&#39;s son from Ten&#39;ousei.  
He should have the symbol of his planet.&quot;
 
&quot;Except that the necklace he was wearing is very selective in its 
owners.&quot;
 
&quot;Nani?&quot;
 
&quot;The stories say that the necklace is an heirloom from the planet 
Uranus, formed from a special stone found when the palace was first 
built by the first Sailor Uranus so long ago.  It was inscribed with the 
symbol of Uranus and given to the second bearer of that henshin stick.  
Regardless of the truth of the origin stories, it cannot be worn by 
someone not of the royal family.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean . . . masaka!  He couldn&#39;t have been!&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Saiki, it can.  Urakaze Haruka is Ten&#39;ou Haruka.&quot;
 
Eiki grabbed Ken&#39;nin&#39;s arm with one hand and Saiki&#39;s with the other.  
&quot;We can&#39;t tell anyone.  If they can&#39;t figure it out, we don&#39;t need to 
tell them.  Haruka-kun married Michiru-san&#151;I&#39;m not sure how, but she 
did&#151;and there are laws against that.  You both know the story of Kazeko 
and Shousha and we know how Mother loved Amami.  We don&#39;t have the right 
to come between those two.&quot;  He could tell that his brothers agreed with 
him, so he released their arms.
 
&quot;I wonder where they got married.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin shrugged at Saiki&#39;s words.  &quot;We could check the records.  Any 
marriage would have been reported.&quot;
 
&quot;Ten&#39;ou Haruka faked her own kidnapping, made off with her henshin stick 
and Space Sword, traveled to Mokusei, Kasei, Kaiousei, and the Moon, 
hiding her true identity from even Queen Shousha.  That&#39;s not easy.  She 
wouldn&#39;t be dumb enough to . . . Moons of Jupiter.&quot;
 
&quot;What?  What is it, Eiki?&quot;
 
&quot;I know where they went.  Earth.&quot;
 
The silence stretched.  &quot;You can&#39;t be serious.  Mako-chan would never go 
to Earth, even for a friend&#39;s wedding.  She wouldn&#39;t.  And yet . . . 
she&#39;s going to Suisei to be with the woman she loves and we all know the 
fight she had for permission.  Do you think they were married on Earth?&quot;
 
&quot;I do, Saiki.  I just wonder why Setsuna-san wouldn&#39;t stop them.  She 
never allows tradition or the rules surrounding the Senshi to be 
corrupted, and she would have known.  She couldn&#39;t have allowed it.&quot;
 
&quot;Then we&#39;ll go ask her.&quot;  Ken&#39;nin pulled a necklace out of his pocket, 
letting the emerald on the end sparkle in the light.  The symbol of 
Jupiter was clearly engraved on the surface.  &quot;Mother told me to give 
this to Mako-chan when she&#39;s old enough.  Until then, we can use it to 
go to Pluto.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t I have a say in this?  Pluto hates being disturbed, and even the 
queen never dares to intrude on her privacy.  Setsuna-san is not going 
to be happy.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Eiki.  She&#39;ll have to be expecting us.  She sees the 
future, remember?&quot;  Ken&#39;nin wrapped his fingers around the emerald, and 
Eiki and Saiki covered his hand with theirs.
 
&quot;She&#39;s going to be so angry.&quot;</pre>
