Minako handed the envelope wordlessly to the man behind the table 
and moved on down the line.  The rituals associated with the 
funeral were distressingly familiar to her.  She&#39;d donated the 
same amount as she had at Shingo&#39;s funeral and ordered a wreath 
of similar size and complexity, since she had loved them both 
equally.  In the distance, she could make out Ikuko, flanked by 
Usagi and Mamoru.  Perhaps later there would time to speak with 
them, though she had no idea what to say.  What would be worse, 
losing one&#39;s son and husband or losing one&#39;s brother and father?  
A twinge of pain jabbed Mina as she pondered briefly what her 
life would be like if she were to lose Rei.  Wiping the tears 
away from her cheek, she moved to find her love.  She had a 
sudden urge to cling to her arm and never let go.

------------

&quot;The baby is crying again,&quot; Hotaru reported.  

Since a funeral was no place for a baby, Setsuna had volunteered 
to babysit Chibi-Usa.  Hotaru had stayed home as well to help.  
The Mistress of Time sighed and gathered up yet another new 
diaper.  One convenient aspect of Hotaru&#39;s rapid aging had been 
the ability to skip potty training altogether.  Setsuna had been 
quite happy to get rid of the diaper pail.  The memory reminded 
her to have Hotaru take the trash out this evening.  Setsuna had 
never heard of a baby that ate as often as Chibi-Usa did and the 
end results of that appetite filled their garbage can.  

&quot;Can I help change the diaper, Setsuna-mama?&quot; Hotaru asked as she 
hovered behind, watching the action.   

Setsuna masked a smile. &quot;Well, it&#39;s a big responsibility, but I 
suppose you are ready for it.&quot;  Trying not to appear too anxious, 
she stepped aside and handed the materials over to her young 
ward.  

----------------

Makoto sat quietly in the passenger seat as Ami drove them back 
to her new apartment.  All day her emotions had been in a tumult.   
Her joy at being with her love once again warred with the guilt 
that she should feel any happiness on such a horrible occasion.  
As always, Ami read her mood perfectly.  Sometimes, when Makoto 
was feeling down, Ami would do everything in her power to shake 
her out of it.  Other times, she said nothing, simply remaining 
close, providing reassurance with her presence alone.  Makoto 
darted her bloodshot eyes over toward her girlfriend, a small 
smile drifting across her face.  &#39;Aishiteru, Ami-love,&#39; she 
thought. 

Eventually, they made their way back to the parking garage 
underneath Ami&#39;s building.  As Ami shut the car off, Makoto made 
no move to get out.  Ami paused with her hand on the door handle 
and then turned in her seat to face her companion.  Again, she 
waited silently.  

&quot;I don&#39;t ever want to leave you again, Ami,&quot; Makoto announced 
after a long pause. 

Ami blushed. &quot;I know, love, I don&#39;t ever want you to leave, but 
it will be ok.  We&#39;ve made it this far; we can survive another 
year.&quot;  She tried desperately to sound upbeat, but ever since 
Makoto had been told by her employers that they required her to 
remain in Europe for at least 14 months longer, a heavy blanket 
of disappointment and sadness had weighed her spirit down.

Reaching forward and taking Ami&#39;s hands in hers, Makoto shook her 
head.  &quot;No, Ami-love, I mean it.  I don&#39;t ever want to leave you 
again. I don&#39;t care what we may have seen of the future.  We 
still have free will and the future can change.  Any day, 
something like this disease or an enemy could take one of us 
away.  If that ever happens, I don&#39;t want to regret that I didn&#39;t 
spend enough time with you.&quot;

Ami began to disagree, trying to reassure Makoto that they need 
not worry about such things, but Makoto silenced her, laying a 
finger lightly over her lips.  &quot;Ami, I&#39;ve proved to myself that I 
can stand on my own.  I&#39;ve been proving it ever since my parents 
died. I&#39;m done with it.  I love you and I want to be with you.  
Nothing is more important than that.&quot;  She lifted her finger to 
Ami&#39;s cheek to wipe away the tears that were falling there. 

&quot;But, Mako, what about your...&quot; Ami sniffled, hope lighting in 
her eyes.

Makoto reached into her purse and retrieved an envelope.  &quot;This 
is my resignation letter; I wrote it on the plane.  There will be 
other jobs, Ami, or I can open a bakery or a flower shop like I 
always dreamed.&quot;  She smiled fondly and caressed Ami&#39;s cheek, 
pressing her hair back behind her ear.  &quot;Or, I can just be a good 
wife to you, if you will have me.&quot;  

Ami&#39;s eyes widened and her breath left her in a loud gasp.  
Suddenly, she flung herself forward, embracing her love 
frantically.  &quot;Oh Mako-love, yes, yes, yes...&quot;  Her voice faded 
as her lips desperately sought out Makoto&#39;s.  The windows of the 
car began to steam up as Ami showered a giddy Makoto with kisses.  

---------------------------

&quot;Am I going to have to have you surgically removed?&quot; Rei chided 
gently.  For almost the entire funeral service and their drive 
back, Minako had pressed herself to Rei&#39;s side.  Rei knew how 
Minako felt, however.  Truly, she felt the same way.  Too much 
sickness and death; it made her appreciate all the more the 
sources of joy in her life.  She stroked Minako&#39;s hair, combing 
it through her fingers. Mina cuddled even closer, sighing sadly.  

&quot;We&#39;re here, Ms. Aino,&quot; the driver announced a few moments later.  

Mina reluctantly sat up.  &quot;Thank you.  You can take the rest of 
the day off; I won&#39;t be going anywhere.&quot;   

The older gentleman nodded with gratitude, especially as Minako 
opened her own door and helped Rei out of the car.   He&#39;d heard 
horror stories about celebrity egos and demands from other 
drivers, but he had never had any such problem with Aino Minako.

Soon, Rei and Mina found themselves in Minako&#39;s condo, high above 
the streets of Tokyo.  As Rei slid her shoes and jacket off, Mina 
pushed some buttons, calling up some light jazz music in the 
background.  The two women sat together on the long sofa in the 
sitting room.  For some time, neither spoke.  Rei sat upright, 
her arm draped over Mina, curled up against her side.  

&quot;Rei,&quot; Mina said eventually, breaking the comfortable, melancholy 
silence, &quot;I want you to move in with me.&quot;

Tilting her head to meet her love&#39;s gaze directly, Rei considered 
Mina&#39;s words.  The idea was certainly something that Rei had 
already pondered at some length. Finally, she replied, &quot;I&#39;d like 
that.&quot;  Her eyes closed as she leaned down to kiss Minako 
tenderly and thoroughly. 

Eventually, Rei began to pull away, only to find her head held in 
place, Mina&#39;s fingers laced throughout her long hair.  Opening 
her eyes, she saw her love gazing back at her with an almost 
feverish expression.  The passion, the love, the want and the 
need that Rei found in those clear blue eyes sent a shiver down 
her spine.  Mina lifted herself slightly, still pressed to Rei&#39;s 
side.  &quot;I need you, Rei,&quot; she whispered in a voice bordering on 
desperation. 

Rei could feel the same level of desire within herself, but even 
in that heated moment, a small part of her remained detached, 
analyzing. Part of the intensity was physical, of course.  The 
feel of her, her scent, the taste of her lips and skin, the sound 
of her breathing and her incomparable beauty; Minako was a full-
blown assault on the senses.  Some of it was the result of the 
emotional tumult they had both been through, the joyous discovery 
of their love intermingled with the two tragic deaths in their 
&#39;extended family&#39;.  The truth could be found beyond all of those 
things, however.  Rei knew now that Minako was a part of her.  
Even while they were apart, there existed a bond that no distance 
could confound.  Minako complemented her and completed her in 
ways she had never even known she&#39;d needed. 

The only thing keeping them apart was this very same part of Rei 
which kept the outside world at bay, the piece of herself that 
she&#39;d never been willing to share with anyone.  Rei had dealt 
with primal forces her entire life.  She had been trained to 
always remain in control, to monitor and manipulate those forces 
around her.  Anger, joy, whatever emotion she felt would wash 
across her for the world to see, but only for a moment.  Even at 
those times, Rei remained in control.   

Now, something threatened that iron fortress of will inside of 
her.  She loved Mina with a love unlike any which she had ever 
experienced.  Her companion gave of herself without question; all 
of her feelings for Rei lay there in her glistening blue eyes as 
she waited for Rei&#39;s response.  The miko&#39;s heart ached, longing 
to return that unquestioning, unconditional love, to let it join 
with Mina&#39;s and carry them both away.  Doing so meant giving 
herself fully to the moment, to the powerful forces tugging at 
her heart and soul, however.  Abruptly, Rei realized that no 
decision need be made, because she&#39;d already decided inside her 
heart.  Her self-reflection came to an end as Rei, for the first 
time in her entire life, opened herself up completely.  

&quot;I need you, too,&quot; she said, surprised at how very true that 
simple statement was.  

Deep inside those violet pools where Minako loved to linger, she 
could see the final walls come down.  A sense of profound joy and 
love suffused her very being as she watched Rei rise and extend a 
hand.  As Mina laid her own hand delicately in Rei&#39;s, her vision 
blurred.  Suddenly, she saw the world in the same way that she 
suspected Rei did.  Everything seemed clearer, brighter and Rei 
radiated with a pure, intense light that was almost blinding.  
Rather than shield herself from that glow, however, Mina willed 
herself to join with it.  She felt the winds of energy swirling 
around her as they did when she transformed, but along with them 
was a profound sense of warmth. 

Rei&#39;s eyes widened as she realized that Minako was experiencing 
the same thing that she was.  She had entered this zone before, 
but only during long meditations, or while transforming into 
Sailor Mars.  She had often wondered about the nature of the 
power that surrounded her in such moments.  Now, she knew the 
answer.  Love was a powerful force, indeed.

&quot;I love you, Minako.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Rei.&quot;

Together, they strolled into their bedroom to complete this one 
portion of their journey through love and life.  Though to an 
outside observer, the room would have appeared dark and quiet, as 
they consummated their love for one another for the first time, 
for Minako and Rei, the air sparkled with colorful lights and the 
crackle of energy unleashed.  

-------------------------------------------------- 

Usagi watched as Mamoru bounced his daughter on his knee.  Though 
her daughter spent the majority of time with her, sometimes Usagi 
suspected that the reason was mainly because the little one was 
so hungry all the time.  When she wasn&#39;t suckling, she was 
generally crying.  Usagi chuckled to herself.  It was so odd, 
watching this infant and knowing what she would become one day.  
&#39;I suppose her daddy complex started early,&#39; Usagi thought.  Even 
at only four months old, her daughter demanded as much of her 
Mamo-chan&#39;s time as possible.  Somehow, it bothered her far less 
now than it had back then.  &#39;Probably because she can&#39;t talk 
yet,&#39; she theorized with a fond laugh.  She decided to give the 
two of them their privacy.

&quot;These need to cool, so hands off,&quot; Ikuko informed her daughter 
as she entered the kitchen.  She carefully set a tray with 
steaming cookies on the counter.  &quot;Is Mamoru watching the baby, 
then?&quot;

Usagi nodded, sending a wistful glance toward the cookies which 
had begun their relentless assault on her sense of smell.  &quot;I&#39;m 
going to gain all of that weight back, Ikuko-mama, if you don&#39;t 
stop making all these sweets.&quot;  

&quot;Nonsense,&quot; Ikuko stated, waving away Usagi&#39;s concern with her 
wooden spoon, &quot;you&#39;re just like your mother, very high 
metabolism.&quot;  The older woman smiled suddenly, her features 
growing soft.  &quot;You are growing up into such a lovely young 
woman, Usagi.  I&#39;m very proud of you.&quot;

Usagi blushed.  Her initial instinct was to deny the compliment 
or to chide her mother for embarrassing her.  Instead, she simply 
replied, &quot;Thank you, mama.  That means a lot to me.  I hope I can 
be half as good a wife and mother as you have been.&quot;  

Ikuko sighed and cast her gaze out the kitchen window.  &quot;I know 
it&#39;s been two months, but sometimes, when Mamoru comes home from 
work, I think it&#39;s him.  I start to call his name and have to 
catch myself.  I miss him.&quot;  

In the fading light of the late afternoon, Usagi looked at her 
mother and, for the first time, wondered when she had started to 
show her age.  Small wrinkles creased her face and white tinged 
her hair, but beyond that, she seemed smaller somehow and quite 
frail.   &quot;What did the doctor say, Ikuko-mama?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I didn&#39;t get a chance to go,&quot; Ikuko replied much too quickly.  
&quot;I had so many errands to run, and there was a lot of traffic.&quot;

Usagi did not have the heart to rebuke her mother.  What good 
would it accomplish?  What could the doctor say, anyway?  They 
had all been through the process twice already; they knew 
everything they needed to know.  Not for the first time, she 
wished that this enemy was just another youma, something she 
could blast with her wand or scepter and make disappear forever.  
Apparently, some things were beyond even Sailor Moon&#39;s power.  
Still, just because Sailor Moon had no solutions to offer, that 
did not mean that Tsukino Usagi must sit and do nothing.  

&quot;It&#39;s Ok, mama.  It was pretty crazy out there today on the 
roads.  Why don&#39;t you go take a hot bath and let me clean up the 
dishes here?&quot; 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not trying to get rid of me so you can 
sample those cookies before they&#39;re cooled?&quot; Ikuko joked as she 
hung up her apron.  

Usagi put on her best look of indignant innocence.  &quot;Mama! Would 
I do something like that?&quot; she wailed quietly.  

Together, they answered, &quot;Of course!&quot; and shared a moment of 
laughter.  As Ikuko left, Usagi rolled up her sleeves and got to 
work on the job at hand.  

----------------------

Makoto held the picture against the wall, making minute 
adjustments in response to Ami&#39;s orders from across the room.  
Finally, Ami announced that it was just right.   Makoto let the 
picture sag on its wire and stepped back to admire it.   Neatly 
hung over their antique sideboard was a photo from Usagi&#39;s 
wedding showing all of the sailor senshi in their formal attire.   
Vases on the sideboard held flowers which rose to either side of 
the picture, framing it nicely on the wall.  

&quot;You have a real flair for interior design, love,&quot; Mako informed 
Ami, generating a blush and a shy smile.  Makoto moved to Ami&#39;s 
side and laid an arm gently across her shoulders.  &quot;That will do, 
until we can replace it.&quot;

Ami looked up at Makoto in shock. &quot;Replace it?  Why would we do 
that? I thought that once we hung this last picture, our home was 
finally complete.&quot;   Ami recalled the weeks spent packing and 
then unpacking boxes, rearranging furniture, shopping for the 
little decorative knickknacks that made a house a home.  A home.  
Her home.  Their home.  Ami nuzzled against Makoto&#39;s side happily 
before rediscovering her train of thought.  &quot;I like that 
picture!&quot; she insisted.

&quot;I do, too, love, but it really is a central focus point for the 
entire living room,&quot; Makoto explained.

&quot;Yes, and thus a perfect place for that picture: us and our 
friends on a very happy day.&quot;

&quot;It was a happy day, and it is a wonderful picture,&quot; Mako agreed, 
smiling cleverly.  &quot;But eventually it will have to be relocated.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Ami asked, suspicions dawning.

Makoto turned and wrapped her arms around Ami&#39;s waist. &quot;Because, 
that is where our wedding portrait will go,&quot; she stated, lifting 
Ami off the ground and into a warm kiss.  

Ami felt dizzy, her feet dangling off of the ground, Makoto&#39;s 
strong, firm arms supporting her entirely.  She locked her arms 
around Makoto&#39;s neck and returned her kiss, waiting for the 
inevitable rush of energy that always came when the two of them 
became intimate.  Soon enough, it was there, sweeping her away 
even as Makoto carried her tenderly to their bedroom.
