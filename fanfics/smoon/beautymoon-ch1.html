<h1>Beauty in the Moonlight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/daughterofmars.html">daughterofmars</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: Based on the Sailor Moon anime, seeing that I have never 
laid eyes on the manga. Events portrayed in this fic take place directly 
after episode 101 and 102 of Sailor Moon Super (the episodes where 
Usagi&#39;s pure heart crystal is stolen). There will be Haruka/Michiru - of 
course, and Haruka/Usagi - unrequited. Besides that mentions of 
Kaorinite and Sailor Jupiter will occur.

Prompt: Quiet, 10lilies on LJ.


Even though Haruka liked giving in to the speed in her blood and letting 
the rush of air around her take away her worries, if only for the 
moment, she knew there were problems she couldn&#39;t solve by letting her 
element sweep them away. In the end, the wind was an unpredictable 
partner and had the unfortunate tendency of turning against you when you 
least expected it, bringing every leaf of trouble with it. Yes, she did 
like the roar of her car engine when accelerating and the growl of her 
bike when she let it loose in a curve, but there was something about the 
quiet of night that had always comforted her when her mind was rustling 
with thoughts like it was now.

The living room was left in darkness around her, the faint moon outside 
the enormous window the only source of illumination. From where Haruka 
was sitting on the windowsill the lights from the city beneath her were 
easy to ignore &#150; and if she raised her gaze just so, leaning her head 
back against the window frame and pushing herself off the windowsill a 
couple of inches, it almost felt as if she was floating among the stars 
up there. Sighing, she eased back against the wall, stretching out her 
long legs, naked skin gleaming in the moonlight. Her alter ego might be 
Mistress of the Winds, but at times like this Haruka longed for the 
ability to fly &#150; sprout wings and forget the day Newton discovered 
gravity.

More than anything, however, she wished that it wasn&#39;t so hard for her 
to ignore her emotions and simply do what was her duty. Back when 
Michiru had saved her from the monster that should prove to be the key 
to her new life, Haruka had been ready to stand up for the boy within 
the beast &#150; convinced that the means could never justify the measures. 
Murder was murder, no matter what; an excuse good enough for killing 
didn&#39;t exist. That was what she had believed then... before Michiru had 
sacrificed herself in order to keep Haruka out of harm&#39;s way.

In the best interest of the majority, a few individuals would have to 
pay with their lives. It was that simple, really. Haruka had learned her 
lesson by now.

Except... it had got a little &#150; no, a lot &#150; more complicated after 
Odango Atama entered the scene....

Gritting her teeth, Haruka turned her head to watch the red and white 
lights of the cars moving like fireflies back and forth on the dim roads 
below, their glow reflected in the glass of the window like droplets of 
radiance. A simple trick of the eye.

She had been so careful to keep her heart out of this; only ever relying 
on Neptune because she was bearing the same burden upon her shoulders &#150; 
neither of them could lose any more than what they had already given up 
on to follow their calling; both aware of the dangers of their mission. 
Being with Michiru, loving Michiru, was safe, because their destinies 
were already entwined.

Tsukino Usagi was another matter entirely. Tsukino Usagi was everything 
Haruka was not supposed to be distracted by at this point in time; 
everything she was not supposed to find appealing or attractive. Yet, 
there was something in the girl&#39;s eyes; in her voice when she had talked 
directly to Haruka&#39;s heart from the backseat of her car about the people 
she was stepping on when trying to complete her task... there was 
something about her beaming smiles and her ridiculous buns that had 
succeeded in edging its way through all of Haruka&#39;s defences.

&quot;Shimatta,&quot; Haruka hissed, mentally scolding herself as she pressed her 
burning forehead against the cool window, Odango&#39;s blushing cheeks 
flaming behind her closed eyelids; her shrill voice as she made her 
little speech echoing in the silence of Michiru&#39;s and hers apartment. 
&quot;Get out of my head, kitten...&quot;

The words were merely a whisper, but just saying them out loud was a 
crime, Haruka knew. She had to stay focused; she had to remember to whom 
she owed her loyalty.... The Talismans. The Grail. The Messiah. She 
needed to find the Messiah before she could let anyone but Michiru into 
her heart. She couldn&#39;t afford to fail.

But she already had....

Today... Today had been her final exam &#150; her graduation project; her 
chance of showing herself that she could do this without stumbling in 
her pace &#150; and Haruka had failed. Her heart had fought her body too 
hard, forcing her to use far too much energy on staying where she was 
without blowing the Daimon to pieces for daring to lay hands on Usagi. 
That was the true reason why she had ended up hurting her shoulder &#150; she 
had faltered, only because Sailor Moon for a second reminded her of 
Odango. It was unforgivable, reprehensible and uncalled-for. Haruka had 
no excuse for saving those pathetic girls from their demise. None.

Except for the fact that for one fleeting moment, Sailor Moon had looked 
just like Tsukino Usagi with her desperate, white face and too brave 
eyes....

Uttering an angry sound, Haruka curled her right hand into a fist, 
hitting it against the pane underneath her over and over, the dull 
sounds of the blows disappearing in the quietness of the room like snow 
melting on the spring-warm ground. It hurt, but not as much as knowing 
that she had let herself down along with her assignment, Michiru and 
everything else she had been entrusted with after awakening as Sailor 
Uranus. For the gentle smile of some cute girl, she had forgotten her 
true objective. It was intolerable.

&quot;Yamete,&quot; a soft voice said; a pair of cool hands grabbing hold of 
Haruka&#39;s arm as she was about to hit her fist against the windowsill 
again. &quot;Sometimes you&#39;re too hard on yourself, Haruka.&quot; Michiru&#39;s tone 
was neither scolding as it had been after her clash with Sailor Jupiter 
nor did it hold the teasing note it had done as she helped Haruka down 
the stairs of Tokyo Tower mere hours ago; after Kaorinite had ended up 
as the target of her own attack. Instead it was filled with a calm 
understanding that did not make Haruka feel better &#150; if anything it only 
made her feel even more blameworthy.

&quot;I would have hated the Messiah if her pure heart&#39;s crystal had turned 
out to be a Talisman,&quot; Haruka told Michiru in a low voice, filled with 
shame, careful not to look at her. Living your life by leaving someone 
behind &#150; stepping on someone else &#150; didn&#39;t feel as heroic as she had 
once convinced herself that it was. To be honest, it felt dirty.

Usagi-chan&#39;s words about joining forces had spoken to the part of Haruka 
who had yelled at Sailor Neptune that the monster she was fighting had 
been a normal boy only a few minutes prior to the attack; the part of 
Haruka which ached every time the word sacrifice came over her lips. 
Groaning almost inaudibly, she hugged her knees to her chest, hiding her 
face in the crook of her arm.

Making a tender sound in the back of her throat, much like the sounds 
Haruka had heard her producing when one of the children in her art class 
fell and bruised a knee &#150; as if she was speaking to a hurt deer or a 
kicked puppy &#150; Michiru caressed the side of Haruka&#39;s face gently. 
Fingers running through Haruka&#39;s dirty blonde hair in a soothing manner, 
she pressed herself against Haruka&#39;s side, the thin fabric of her night 
gown making the skin on her arm tickle.

So typically Michiru this was; always accepting, always indulgent of all 
Haruka&#39;s moods if she could feel that Haruka didn&#39;t have the energy for 
a discussion. Had it been anyone else, she would have felt annoyed by 
it, but with Michiru it was hard staying angry if they weren&#39;t exactly 
on the brink of one of their rows.

It wasn&#39;t because Michiru would take everything from her, Haruka knew &#150; 
on the contrary, she hated patronizing just as much as being patronized 
and drew the line when she felt it was necessary; with Haruka&#39;s 
flirting, with Haruka&#39;s attitude, with everything Haruka, really. 
Nevertheless, Michiru had a good intuition and often seemed to 
instinctively know what people around her needed, especially when it 
came to her tomboyish lover.

&quot;You would have taken the crystal of her heart, had it been required of 
you,&quot; Michiru reminded her, &quot;and that&#39;s what is important. You would 
have ignored your feelings and accomplished your mission, if it had been 
necessary.&quot; Her fingers never stopped their movement through Haruka&#39;s 
hair; pushing her bangs away from her face again and again in comforting 
little touches of fingertips against her cool skin.

Haruka squeezed her eyes shut and moved her arm to lean her head against 
the soft curve of Michiru&#39;s breasts. She knew it was true &#150; she knew 
Michiru was right, as she so often was, but it didn&#39;t make her hate what 
she had done any less. Was it supposed to comfort her, the fact that she 
would have let Usagi die to get hold of the Grail? Was it supposed to 
make her feel justified?

An innocent. That was what Odango Atama was; that was what Haruka was so 
attracted to about her... her purity. She would never be able to 
understand the difficulties of Sailor Uranus&#39; mission or the conflict of 
emotions it led to within Haruka&#39;s soul. No, Odango thought everything 
could be solved with love and peace and good intentions, but Haruka was 
too old &#150; too much of a soldier &#150; to believe in that anymore.

God, how she wanted to believe in it... how she wanted to have that kind 
of conviction....

Losing your faith was the hardest part of growing up.

Letting her arms come up to encircle Michiru&#39;s waist, she pulled the 
other girl closer, feeling Michiru take a tentative step forward as 
Haruka twisted her own body to hide her face at her neck; the familiar, 
reassuring scent of Michiru embracing her in much the same way as 
Michiru&#39;s hands resting on her shoulders did, straying from time to time 
to stroke her back through the tank-top Haruka normally wore at night.

Odango with all her inexperience and childhood beliefs was a temptation 
&#150; an unpolished diamond placed in front of Haruka to blind her when the 
sunlight made it shine like crystallized water; Sailor Neptune and 
Talismans forgotten in its brightness. Still, she was only a gem. Haruka 
could deal with gems.... She had to, because faith alone wouldn&#39;t win a 
battle. To come out victorious, it would take action and, despite her 
unwillingness, sacrifices. These were the unchangeable aspects of war.

Feeling Michiru step back, Haruka finally opened her eyes to face her 
partner. Outside, the morning was creeping through the darkness and 
silence of night, the pale pink blush of the sunset casting shadows on 
Michiru&#39;s face and down her body like a puzzle of shadow and light. In 
the dim glow of dawn, Michiru&#39;s eyes had the same colour as the ocean at 
night, so dark blue that they almost seemed blackish, softened by the 
small smile curling on her lips.

Michiru was striking in her beauty &#150; more valuable than any gemstone in 
the world and Haruka appreciated it, knowing that things around them 
could change all they wanted, Michiru would stay by her side, just like 
the sea would always stay near the sky in the horizon.

In daylight doubt was easier to close your eyes to. Luckily.

&quot;Gomen,&quot; Haruka apologised, sitting up straighter, the glass of the 
window clammy and cold against her bare shoulder as she moved. She tried 
with her trademark crooked smile, but knew it didn&#39;t reach her eyes. &quot;It 
was the moonlight...&quot;

Laughing, Michiru crossed her arms over her chest, her nightdress riding 
up her thigh just enough for Haruka to ignore any thoughts of Tsukino 
Usagi at the moment. &quot;You can&#39;t use that excuse twice, Haruka,&quot; Michiru 
teased in a voice that was no longer softened by the soul of night and 
sympathy for Haruka&#39;s inner turmoil. Now a new day would begin. After 
sunset they could be Tenoh Haruka and Kaioh Michiru &#150; sixteen year old 
girls with all the issues an identity like that resulted in &#150; but during 
the sunlit hours, they were Senshi.

Pushing herself off the windowsill and stretching her sore back as she 
stood up, Haruka took a deep breath. As long as they stayed here in 
Tokyo, as long as they attended Mugen Gakuen and kept up the fa&ccedil;ade of a 
normal pair of young Japanese women &#150; to whatever extend they could &#150; 
this was the double-life she had to live. Fighting and battling her 
conscience every time a struggle ended. Until it was all over.

And maybe when it was, Haruka thought to herself, closing her eyes for a 
brief moment... Maybe then she could allow herself to be warmed by the 
light she felt surrounding Tsukino Usagi.

Until then, though....

Blinking as she heard the sound of footsteps &#150; bare feet against the 
floor, three soft steps before silence indicated a halt &#150; Haruka opened 
her eyes to find herself face to face with Michiru, her arms now by her 
sides and her eyes the same colour as the sea on a day when it reflected 
the colour of the sky above. Cocking her head, Michiru reached out and 
took her hand, their fingers interlacing in the easy way that came with 
the kind of relationship they shared &#150; long evenings on the couch, 
talking; followed by even longer, quiet nights in a bed that was 
probably not quite big enough for two people.

Haruka was well aware of the fact that when it came to her partner in 
crime, she couldn&#39;t hide anything; especially not when Michiru was 
seeking answers as she did in this moment, all her attention focused on 
Haruka&#39;s face &#150; on her uneasy features; forehead creasing in a frown, 
lips pressed together in a taut line. Any mask Haruka might have tried 
hiding behind wouldn&#39;t have survived those eyes.

Michiru pursed her own lips as if she saw something on Haruka&#39;s face 
that confirmed her thoughts and then nodded, refraining from saying 
anything but: &quot;Look out the window, Haruka&quot;, making Haruka wonder for a 
moment what she felt when it came to Odango. Did she feel the same 
warmth about her as Haruka did? After all, between the two of them 
Michiru was the one with a streak of psychic powers.... Not Haruka; 
however much she was able to vaguely sense and foretell in her frequent, 
nightly returns to her castle of the heavens from once upon a peaceful 
kingdom.

As Michiru had told her to, Haruka turned around towards the window 
again, not entirely sure what she was supposed to see in the scenario 
before her, but eyes still following the waves of sunlight that now 
began to break against the facades of the skyscrapers and run through 
the streets like golden liquid.

&quot;You have a kind heart, koi, I know...&quot; Michiru whispered in her ear, 
pressing herself against Haruka&#39;s back and leaning up on her toes to 
rest her chin on Haruka&#39;s shoulder &#150; the left, because her right 
shoulder was still swollen and painful from the cut she had received 
during her little t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Kaorinite. &quot;Therefore, never forget 
that it&#39;s a beautiful world you&#39;re trying to save, doing what you have 
to do &#150; what only you can do.&quot;

The words made Haruka recall the first time she met Usagi-chan and that 
other girl... Minako-chan, was it? They had asked what her dream was now 
when it wasn&#39;t becoming a famous racer. &quot;Doing something only I can do,&quot; 
she had told them, Michiru having grabbed hold of her hand in empathy &#150; 
like Michiru always did, because she had been with Haruka from the 
start, recognising the self-control Haruka had to muster not to break 
their sacred promise.

Staring unseeingly at the sun rising over the city like a ripe orange, 
caught up in the feeling of Michiru&#39;s gentle presence and an image 
coming to mind; an echo of Usagi as she had opened her eyes to look up 
at Sailor Uranus, asking if they had really saved her, Haruka suddenly 
remembered that Usagi hadn&#39;t been the bearer of a Talisman. She was 
still an innocent; still untouched by the war Haruka and Michiru were 
trying to win. They hadn&#39;t found their sacrifice yet, but it wasn&#39;t 
Tsukino Usagi and to Haruka that was a relief.

&quot;Something only I can do,&quot; she repeated, feeling Michiru&#39;s smile rather 
then seeing it out the corner of her eye. The sun hung between two 
building tops, its glow having turned white instead of golden, heralding 
the approaching noon; the shine of the moon a faint silhouette in 
comparison. The time of the moon would return, but for now Haruka had to 
spend her days on finding a way to rescue everything she had come to 
believe in.

For Odango Atama-chan&#39;s sake as well, because Usagi possessed the beauty 
of the moon and the quiet strength of the night when the wind was lulled 
to sleep.

Perhaps faith wasn&#39;t completely lost to Haruka after all, because &#150; 
indeed &#150; the world before her was beautiful, but this blonde girl with 
her blue eyes and cute hairwas as well, and Haruka would keep that in 
mind as she searched for the Grail.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me feel jealous, Tenoh Haruka,&quot; Michiru murmured, her arms 
tightening around Haruka&#39;s waist as if she was afraid she would run 
towards freedom in case she were to let go. Normally Michiru tolerated 
Haruka&#39;s soft spot for pretty girls, but just as well as Haruka knew 
that it was different when it came to Tsukino Usagi, so did Michiru. 
Reaching down to cover Michiru&#39;s hands with her own, Haruka withheld a 
reply to remind the Senshi of the Sea that nothing in this world could 
keep the wind prisoner when it decided to blow freely... but even when 
it did, even when it ran along foreign coasts and coached the kites of 
little girls towards the sky, it still carried the scent of the ocean to 
which it would always return. In the end.

Usagi was a brilliant pearl &#150; a priceless diamond, even.... but Haruka 
had never used jewellery for other purposes than to feel a short 
moment&#39;s awe and admiration. The wind was unpredictable, yes, but not 
unfaithful.

&quot;If you didn&#39;t know me better... ne?&quot; responded Haruka, her smile 
returning and this time it felt genuine. Michiru relaxed against her 
back, sighing softly.

&quot;Yes, if I didn&#39;t know you better...&quot; she said.

The silence that fell between them held promises neither needed to 
express.</pre>
