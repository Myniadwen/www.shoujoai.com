<h1>All Must Be Endured</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/reichs.html">Reichs</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Never mind the differences between the North American Sailor Moon dub 
and the Japanese original, what about the differences between the 
original series and the manga? 

Well, this is fic contains much non graphic lesbianism, angst and wild 
assumptions about the sexual orientations of the Sailor Moon girls. No 
senshi were harmed in the making of this fic, although the author did 
lose her mind and convinced herself she&#39;d be able to break dimensional 
barriers with a plastic spoon.

------------------------------------------------------------------

Minako&#39;s eyes widened at Yaten&#39;s chuckle and she dropped into a 
relaxed stance. I followed suit but said nothing.

&quot;You&#39;ve got me, oops&quot;, she said, maybe trying to mask her shock. Her 
brows knit over eyes full of distrust and anger. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she started, 
&quot;I&#39;ve given my life to my one and only...&quot; she trailed off, eyes 
dropping to the ground, lashes falling over eyes softened with the 
vision of her. I knew who she was talking about, I could practically 
see the vision that filled her mind. Long silver hair, smiling face. 
Let me crawl into your arms, Princess, it&#39;s our only dream. 

Before Yaten had another chance to stab at poor Minako, I moved to 
her. &quot;Actually,&quot; I said, flowing in behind her, &quot;we don&#39;t need any 
men.&quot; I raised a finger to my lip, touching where she touched me 
earlier, resting my elbow on her shoulder. She leaned into me, head 
drifting to rest against mine and one hand brushing the fabric 
covering my thigh. I matched his smirk.

&quot;You have a problem with that?&quot;

&quot;No. I wouldn&#39;t expect any less from a Sailor Senshi!&quot;

Damn him. What does he know anyway?

------------------------------------------------------------------

He knew enough to save my Princess, or at least his own Princess did. 
My memory&#39;s so jumbled that I can only remember flashes here and 
there. Venus and I running, hands outstretched to her, ripping in my 
chest, fighting against her, trying to kill her... And for the longest 
time, nothing, I could feel nothing. I was truly dead, my Sailor 
Crystal melted in the Galaxy Cauldron by Galaxia. 

And then her power filled me, her beautiful, wondrous power and I was 
alive again. I awoke cradled against Minako, our arms around each 
other. I saw all that I felt mirrored in her eyes and we said nothing, 
tears streaming down our faces. 

------------------------------------------------------------------ 

&quot;Usagi! Sorry we couldn&#39;t help you.&quot; 

Is that the best I could have come up with? How about; &#39;I&#39;m sorry that 
because I&#39;m a crappy leader and a total airhead you died&#39; or how about 
&#39;I&#39;m sorry I tried my best to kill you&#39; or why not just ask her to 
kill me? Tears burned my eyes, and I&#39;m pretty sure they did the same 
to Rei as she gripped my hand. 

But damn it, she ran to me and held me as if I&#39;d done nothing wrong, 
burying her head in my shoulder and crying tears of sheer happiness. 
So glad to see me, so happy. 

I love her so much. 

Gods, I love my Princess to bits. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

And now, all&#39;s back to normal. Ami-chan&#39;s still hitting the books like 
there&#39;s no tomorrow, Mamoru-san&#39;s gone back to study in Harvard, 
Mako-chan&#39;s growing hybrid roses in school and Rei&#39;s still busy in the 
temple and at her own school. Hotaru-chan&#39;s a bit lonely without 
Chibi-Usa, but she&#39;s still having fun and making lots of new friends, 
Setsuna-san&#39;s still a school nurse, only god knows why though. 
Michiru&#39;s got a squad of fans following her around, though a certain 
someone chases most of them off.

And that someone&#39;s sitting here beside me, munching on an apple. 

&quot;Ne, Minako-chan,&quot; Haruka says, looking out over our high school 
(probably at the girls playing tennis down there, that ecchi!). 

I glance over at her, brushing hair out of my face. The wind gets 
pretty strong at the top of the school. She turns and studies my face 
for a moment, white-blonde hair jumping every which way, then sighs 
and looks back to the ground, eyes soft and full of affection. She&#39;s 
so beautiful and strong; a great role model. I wish I was half as 
strong as her, maybe I&#39;d be better able to keep Usagi-chan safe. 

&quot;Is she writing love letters again?&quot; that low voice asks, meeting my 
eyes again. 

And now I know her greatest weakness and she knows mine and we&#39;ll take 
strength from that, offer support. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Rain falls over the shrine, rinsing the dust and muck down the drains. 
Phobos and Deimos are hiding under eaves somewhere and grandpa&#39;s 
poking around trying to fix the leak in the tool shed roof. 

I retire to my room and fall onto my bed. The heat and humidity are 
really getting to me today. I close my eyes and let my breath slow 
down a bit. My mind clouds with hazy half dreams and I let myself be 
carried away on a tide of fuzzy musings of what will never be.

The next thing I know, I&#39;m awakened as my mattress sags and a gentle 
touch brushes hair out of my face, stroking my forehead and cheek. I 
reach up and touch the gentle hand, our fingers twining. Minako smiles 
down at me as I open my eyes, blinking sleepily. 

&quot;He asked her to marry him.&quot; She says, a sad smile on her face. Once 
she weds, once she has her child... I close my eyes at the memory of 
what is to come. It&#39;s so selfish of me, I know. She&#39;s going to suffer 
so much, and all I can think of is how jealous I am of him. How much 
would I, would any of us, give to be the one she offers her heart and 
soul to? The one she smiles at first thing in the morning, who she 
turns to when she needs help. Who she says &#39;I love you&#39; to. 

Minako shifts on my bed, never letting go of my hand, and leans over 
me, touching her other hand to my lips. I smile and open my eyes. &quot;She 
must be so happy,&quot; I whisper as Minako leans down, her breath warming 
my face.

&quot;I&#39;ve never seen her happier.&quot; She rests her forehead on mine and I 
can see her eyes shine wetly as she smiles. &quot;She said she can&#39;t wait 
to start their eternity together.&quot; Black lashes fall over cornflower 
eyes, the light from the hall reflecting dampness on her cheek. &quot;She 
can&#39;t wait for all of us to start our eternity, together forever.&quot;

I feel tears on my own face as a shuddering breath is released, a 
second catches in her throat. 

&quot;Eternity&#39;s such a long time, Minako.&quot; 

She nods, and her lips touch mine.

I never thought it could feel like this, with someone else.

------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;And maybe, I&#39;ll find some peace tonight...&quot;

Your English is near perfect, nearly no accent. Rich as melted 
chocolate but with a sandpaper edge. The violin tucked under my chin 
isn&#39;t the best accompaniment to your piano, I think it&#39;s cello in the 
original, but I begin to play anyway. You&#39;re surprised, you didn&#39;t 
think I was listening. We play the song together, it&#39;s slow and 
mournful. You once told me that it was written as a dirge to people 
who died from heroin overdoses. 

It suits us as well though. We could die any second from the fire in 
our veins, from our love for her. We know the risk, we know that our 
purpose in life is to serve as cannon fodder. It doesn&#39;t matter 
though, does it love? I know that you love her as much as I do and 
that you&#39;d gladly give every ounce of your soul to her if she asked 
for it, as she has before. You&#39;ve died, my precious, and so have I. 
But knowing that it could happen again doesn&#39;t matter because it would 
be for her, in her name and for her sake. It would be worth it, I know 
that, I know it for sure.

&quot;May you find 
Some comfort here.&quot; 

You hold the last note for a few minutes, your eyes closed as if 
remembering something painful. But then, there&#39;s no &#39;as if&#39;, is there? 
You&#39;re probably thinking about the wedding. I put my violin down and 
sit beside you on the piano bench, wrapping my arms around you and 
laying my head on your shoulder. 

&quot;Love,&quot; I breathe into your soft ear, ruffling short white strands 
with one hand and caressing strong hands with the other. You grip me 
around the waist and bury your face in the crook of my shoulder, 
heaving great sighs. 

&quot;I&#39;m so happy for her,&quot; you say in a tiny voice. I can nearly hear the 
sobs in your voice, my strong, beautiful Haruka. I love you so much, 
you&#39;re so very dear to me, more than I can ever say. &quot;It must be so 
hard for Minako-tachi,&quot; you continue, nuzzling the side of my neck and 
throat. &quot;I know that whatever pain I feel can never be as great as 
theirs, never.&quot;

You lift watery eyes to meet mine and cup my face gently, smiling 
gently. &quot;I sometimes think I don&#39;t have a heart or mind or soul at 
all, you know that? She owns half of me,&quot; you begin to stroke my 
cheeks with calloused thumbs, your eyes never leaving mine. 

&quot;And you; you, my dear, sweet, wonderful, beautiful girl, own the rest 
of me.&quot; 

Oh love, I could melt into you when you say things like that, when you 
touch me like that, when you kiss me like this. I pull away 
reluctantly, fingertips touching a fluttering pulse in your neck and 
chest. &quot;I love you, Haruka.&quot; And I so rarely say it, so very rarely.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever leave me, please,&quot; you say, toying with the soft, fine 
hair at the top of my neck, sending shivers through me. 

&quot;I won&#39;t, our souls are bound to each other as surely as they&#39;re bound 
to the Princess. I&#39;ll never leave you.&quot;

You lift me up in soft arms, catching my lips again and carry me to 
our bedroom.

I&#39;ll never be able to tell you how much I love you, Haruka. Because I 
don&#39;t think I love you half as much as you deserve.

------------------------------------------------------------------

It&#39;s nice to have the girls around once in a while. I&#39;ve grown so fond 
of all of them, I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do without them. Usagi and 
Mamoru-san left a few hours ago with Ami-chan, Usagi needs all the 
rest she can get after all, and Ami-chan has a dissection first thing 
tomorrow. 

I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not a doctor. 

Setsuna and Hotaru went to bed a while ago, and Mako-chan left ten 
minutes ago. Minako surveys my now sparsely populated living room from 
her position between Rei and Michiru on the couch and raises an 
eyebrow. She drains the last of her wine and sets the glass back on 
the coffee table and I cringe at the number of empty bottles. 
Considering that Usagi, Mamoru, Ami-chan and Mako-chan weren&#39;t 
drinking... 

&quot;Hmph,&quot; she starts, &quot;no stamina at all! It&#39;s only half past one in the 
morning!&quot;

&quot;Just because they&#39;re not possessed party animals, like you-&quot; Rei 
says, a light flush over her delicate features. Michiru smiles softly 
and I nearly melt. I could watch this all night.

&quot;Oh hush,&quot; Minako says, folding her arms over her chest and sticking 
her nose in the air haughtily. Rei laughs and lays a hand on her 
tummy, tickling her gently. Minako squeals and tries to get away from 
her tormentor, only to be stopped when Michiru (my quiet, reserved and 
elegant Michiru!?!) grabs her wrists and holds them over her head, 
allowing Rei full access to her sensitive belly. 

Minako makes a few high-pitched protests (y&#39;know, aaahhh! eeeeeeehhh! 
noooo!), arching her back and drawing her legs up to her chest. I 
chuckle as Rei practically jumps into her lap to keep her legs down 
and continues her onslaught. I get out of my armchair and kneel beside 
the couch, snaking both hands out and delivering a crushing counter 
strike to Rei and Michiru. Both yelp, Michiru&#39;s hands fly to her sides 
to cover herself but she finds herself blocked by Minako so she pulls 
the blonde into her lap, using her as a shield (she&#39;s done that to 
Hotaru before, when she was the victim of a two pronged attack from 
Setsuna and me). Rei stops tickling her as well, and the three fall 
into a moment of relaxed giggling and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen 
such a wonderful sight on my living room sofa. 

The moment passes when the three of them realise what a compromising 
position they&#39;re in and awkwardness seems inevitable until Minako 
pulls Rei (who&#39;s straddling her hips. I told you this was a glorious 
sight!) down into her arms, kissing her forehead affectionately and 
relaxing into Michiru. Rei lays her head on Minako&#39;s chest and closes 
her eyes as Michiru strokes her arm, letting out a contented sigh.

I scoot as near to the pile as I can, propping my head up in one hand 
as I watch them. Rei smiles and shifts her head slightly. 

&quot;I used to be so confused by you two,&quot; she mumbles as Minako strokes 
her hair. &quot;I didn&#39;t trust either of you for a long time after you 
proved yourselves allies because you were so madly in love with each 
other. How could you hold her in high enough esteem, how could you 
truly love her if you already had each other? I couldn&#39;t understand it 
at all.&quot;

I reach out and touch her face, she who is so new to all this despite 
her apparent maturity. &quot;Now I understand,&quot; she says, touching my hand, 
a great sadness in her voice. &quot;I understand.&quot; 

Minako lifts her face and kisses her gently. &quot;Usagi is so pure and so 
good, Rei-chan, no honestly felt love can do her any wrong at all. 
She&#39;s love incarnate, failing to love to your hearts content would be 
a sin against her.&quot; Rei nods, and we&#39;re all silent. &quot;Although,&quot; Minako 
continues, &quot;that doesn&#39;t make it any easier, does it?&quot; she murmurs 
into violet locks. &quot;It might even make it harder, because it makes us 
love her more.&quot;

I woke up the next morning when Setsuna came in for breakfast. Such a 
beautiful tangle of limbs and shining hair and soft skin and delicate 
touches, I was loath to wake them at all.

I made damn sure to take pictures though. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

I often wonder why I feel this way about Usagi-chan. I&#39;ve never felt 
this way about anyone before, let alone a girl. It&#39;s so different from 
anything I feel for anyone else. I love all my friends dearly, but 
it&#39;s not the same at all. I don&#39;t sigh when I see Minako getting 
starry eyed over the latest boy group. I don&#39;t flush when Makoto hugs 
me. I don&#39;t feel like my heart could burst when Mamoru compliments my 
studies. I don&#39;t avert my eyes when Rei looks at me for more than a 
moment. I don&#39;t feel light headed every time I see Michiru in a 
swimsuit. I don&#39;t feel warm all over when Haruka guides me through a 
crowd. You could call what I feel for them platonic love.

If Plato hadn&#39;t been a bit of an insane maniac who believed that the 
best way to absolute wisdom was sex with young boys. 

Enough of that. 

But love. What is it? Is there really any difference between the love 
I have for my friends and the love I have for our Princess? I can&#39;t 
say that I don&#39;t adore each and every one of my friends but I don&#39;t 
yearn for that same closeness. I want to melt into her, I want her to 
hold me and never let me go. I want to be able to hear her heart beat, 
I want to be able to do these things and have her accept me doing 
them. 

I&#39;m asking so much, such selfishness. But then, I don&#39;t expect these 
things to ever happen. I shouldn&#39;t think about them at all. She is the 
most loving person I know. She loves without question and with her 
entire heart. She feels the same way about us as I do for the others 
and feels for Mamoru what I feel for her. I&#39;m sure of it. 

Such a pure, innocent wonderful girl. How can I be saddened? It&#39;s 
terribly selfish of me, selfish and nonsensical. She&#39;s happy, and 
that&#39;s all that matters. She treats us all so well, never afraid to 
let us know that she loves us all.

All of us felt so empty before we met her and why not? A piece of our 
soul was missing, after all. When we found her, we all wanted so badly 
to reclaim that piece of our soul, to have her near us the entire 
time, to know that she&#39;s safe. It&#39;s never enough to know that someone 
else is looking after her, not when each of us loves her so much. 

It&#39;s so confusing; no matter what I do or think I can&#39;t stop wanting 
her. No matter how illogical and absurd it is, I can&#39;t stop. Maybe I 
should talk to the girls about it.

Or maybe considering the way some of them have been eying me up, I&#39;d 
better not.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Such warm lips. Such a sweet mouth. Small warm hands gliding over me, 
sliding into my hair and under clothes. Skin soft under my fingers.

She&#39;s so small in my arms, so petit and gentle.

So soft. 

It&#39;s nearly enough to make me not think about you.

------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ne, Usagi-chan,&quot; I ask, rolling onto my back and nearly squashing my 
new manga.

&quot;Nani, Hotaru-chan?&quot; she says, watching gentle rain fall over the 
window pane in my room, her belly full and round with new life. 

I pause. How to ask her. I&#39;ll just follow Haruka&#39;s example, I think, 
and bull on in. &quot;When you defeated Galaxia and Chaos, you said that 
you gained something. I, I remember you looking so sad when you said 
that.&quot;

Her face falls, eyes become unfocused and distant. Not a sound. I 
remember her telling Setsuna about it one night a couple of years ago, 
and Haruka and Michiru were discussing it last night. Whenever anyone 
mentions this &#39;gift&#39;, they get so sad. I wonder what it could be? 
She&#39;s still not said anything, I hope I didn&#39;t upset her. I&#39;ve gotten 
bigger, but it seems that my brain hasn&#39;t caught up yet.

&quot;The power to lose everything and the power to save everything.&quot; She 
says slowly. &quot;I gained that power.&quot; 

I must look confused because the next thing I know, she reaches out 
and pats my head. A bit silly, considering that in my old (teen) age, 
I am in fact taller than my queen. Not that that would be hard or 
anything... &quot;Is there someone or something that you&#39;d give your life 
for, Hotaru-chan? Something that you depend on. Something that makes 
you, well, you. Something that you define yourself with?&quot; I can&#39;t look 
at her in the eye anymore. &quot;Something you cherish more than anything 
else?&quot;

I nod. No, don&#39;t make me remember, please. Don&#39;t.

&quot;When that disappears and you have nothing else, you can either 
collapse in on yourself, like a popped balloon, or find the strength 
to go on regardless, just so you can treasure the memory of your 
precious thing. It&#39;s then, and only then, that you can truly and 
selfishly save everything.&quot; She quirks her mouth and shrugs. &quot;It 
sounds so strange, I know, but that&#39;s what happened to me. When you 
all died,&quot; even now, the word catches in her throat, &quot;I lost 
everything that I had to fight for. I wanted to die. I needed to 
forget that pain so badly. But I couldn&#39;t, I couldn&#39;t because I knew 
that if I were to melt in the Cauldron with the rest of you then no 
one would carry on your precious memories.&quot;

She lifts my chin and smiles beautifully at me. &quot;Was that too weird? I 
can&#39;t explain it at all, can I?&quot;

I force a smile, it feels pretty lopsided. &quot;It&#39;s ok, I think I 
understand. How, how,&quot; I sound pathetic, &quot;how did you go on without 
any hope?&quot; Please, give me hope, please.

&quot;Because I loved you all too much not to.&quot;

I hug her close to my chest and squeeze her. I think I can understand 
the way the others feel about her, the sighs and glances and furtive 
and forlorn faces. I understand, but I don&#39;t share those feelings. Not 
for her. 

&quot;Everyone has that power within them, as long as they love and are 
loved in return.&quot;

Her voice is muffled and I can&#39;t help but smile. I let her go and she 
holds my hand gently. &quot;None of us would have that power without you, 
not at all.&quot;

She smiles mischievously and cocks her head to one side. &quot;But I&#39;m not 
your Princess, am I Hotaru-chan?&quot;

I blush redder than your average tomato and cough into one fist. She 
just grins at me and taps my nose. &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; she goes to leave 
my room but pauses at the door. &quot;I&#39;m fine with being your Queen.&quot;

Damn, our Usagi&#39;s grown up without anyone realizing it. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Usagi and I are sitting on a bench in the park, watching Small Lady 
scoot around after a ball, munching on ice cream cones. Oh, isn&#39;t she 
a dote! Her hair&#39;s nothing but fluff on her head (the poor child was 
practically bald until a month or two ago).

&quot;Usagi-chan, she&#39;s so cute!&quot;

Usagi nods happily, munching on her cone happily. She looks like she&#39;s 
a child herself again when she does that! Our beautiful, precious 
Usagi-chan. Small Lady pulls herself up on the edge of the bench, 
waving chubby hands at Usagi&#39;s cone, causing a serene smile to spread 
over her features. 

She lifts her child, cradling her baby in slender arms and talking 
mother-ese to the bouncing bundle on her lap. She&#39;s smiling the whole 
time, lips curved up beautifully, eyes soft and full of affection for 
her daughter. She breaks off a tiny piece of cone, scoops up some ice 
cream and feeds it to her Small Lady.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that nice, that nice? Yummy ice-cream, yummy!&quot;

Small Lady laughs loudly at her mother, taking a fist full of ice 
cream and licking her fingers, then offering the mucky pile to her 
mother, patting porcelain cheeks and leaving chocolate-y handprints 
everywhere. Usagi makes a face, then laughs, kissing her child on her 
forehead. She whips out a baby wipe and cleans Small Lady up before 
sending her off after her ball again.

&quot;What a mess, Mako-chan, look at me.&quot;

I do, and despite the fact that she&#39;s covered in melting ice cream and 
bits of wafer, her eyes are soft and dancing with mirth. I laugh, I 
laugh and laugh until my sides ache and tears stream from my eyes. I 
take a baby wipe from her and clean her up, leaving her skin, well, as 
soft as a baby&#39;s backside. Although I don&#39;t think it&#39;s politically 
correct to say that anymore. Ah well. 

&quot;Thanks Mako-chan!&quot;

&quot;Ara, no problem.&quot; Oh God&#39;s, I&#39;m blushing. She smiles impishly and 
reaches up to clean a spot of ice cream from my cheek. 

&quot;There, the favor&#39;s returned.&quot; I could melt at this moment in time, 
absolutely melt. She&#39;s so full of joy, our Usagi-chan. She brings so 
much joy and love to us all, more than we ever imagined could exist. 
This world is hers, this world and all the people on it are here to 
keep her happy and make her smile. And if they&#39;re not, then they 
should be, I reckon. She never asks for anything in return, she fills 
our hearts and souls with such warmth and never, ever asks for a 
reward or even an acknowledgement of her greatness. 

So selfless, so innocent and pure and good and wonderful. I&#39;d do 
anything to keep you happy, Usagi-chan, anything. 

I pull her into an impromptu hug, but she shows no signs of being 
startled or annoyed. She burrows into my arms and hugs me back, her 
soft head under my chin. I expect she&#39;s used to this kind of behavior 
by now, she&#39;d have to be. She backs out of the embrace and kisses me 
on the forehead, her soft power filling me, sustaining me until the 
next embrace, to the next time soft, warm lips caress me.

She looks into my eyes, blue eyes clear and guileless, such honesty 
and love. I know she knows how we all feel for her, that moment I know 
that she knows my heart beats only for her and her happiness. 

&quot;You know, I read somewhere that Jupiter protects the Earth. If it 
wasn&#39;t for Jupiter&#39;s gravity then tons of comets would hit us, maybe 
something as big as Shoemaker-Levy.&quot; She hugs me again, smiling up at 
me. &quot;Just like you, Jupiter protects the weak little, tiny, rock of 
the Earth.&quot;

I smile wanly. &quot;I&#39;ll always protect you, Princess.&quot;

Small Lady chooses that minute to crawl over and demand attention. She 
sits between us on the bench and if I could make this day last forever 
for my Princess, I would. My sweet, beautiful, wonderful Usagi-chan. 
I&#39;ll tear the stars from the sky to keep you safe.

------------------------------------------------------------------

I sink deeply, deeply into silken sheets and sigh loudly, too drained 
to even pull a blanket over me. 

I did it. I finally, finally defeated Sailor Chaos. 

But I couldn&#39;t have done it without Eternal Sailor Moon, without 
Tsukino Usagi. Oh, I&#39;m still her, really, but a thousand years can 
change a person, and it&#39;s changed me. Sapped my strength and worn me 
down to nothing. 

For many, many decades my dear, my beloved husband has lain in a coma. 
He can project his form, but there is little else he can do. He can 
rarely touch, he can&#39;t be touched. I can&#39;t hold him to me, I can&#39;t 
crush him in my arms like I used to, or cuddle up to him at night... 
it&#39;s terrible. I&#39;ve shared my bed with him for countless years (905, 
if you must) and my soul for an eternity. And now, he lies in a cold, 
cruel coffin, life sustained by the crystal around him. 

I roll into my pillow, wrapping my arms around it and sighing hugely. 
What a selfish woman I am. After the Black Moon&#39;s attacks, after my 
own taste of lying in one of those glass prisons I should know better 
than to leave my husband there, than to leave my friends there. My 
beautiful, wonderful Inner Senshi were able to move around for a few 
months after we were all saved by Sailor Moon, what a glorious time! 
As if we were back in high school, all of us together again. But 
before long the strain became too much and one by one they lay back 
down in their coffins, and now the only thing keeping them alive is 
the palace&#39;s enchantments and their will to serve me. A few weeks 
after Venus closed her eyes for the last time, Endymion did the same. 
And Luna and Artemis, in their basket at the foot of my bed... 
unmoving for sixty years this time. 

And what of our poor daughter? The past is a far better place for her, 
but she cannot remain there forever. When she came home this time, I 
told her. I let her know the truth of her father&#39;s and friends&#39; 
situation. I even showed her the Outers.

Oh? The Outers. You didn&#39;t know. Well, maybe I should explain. There 
is simply no way to kill a Sailor Senshi, except maybe the destruction 
of our Sailor Crystals, but that didn&#39;t slow us down for long in the 
past... Anyway, just before the creation of Crystal Tokyo there was a 
battle, a great, horrible, terrifying battle for our little planet. 

I rise, fatigue and weariness gone now, and walk down into the bowels 
of the palace. You see, before Death Phantom became a being of pure 
will, he was a man. A man, born like you or I to a mother, he went to 
school, he graduated from college and somewhere, developed a horrible 
fascination with the black arts. A long, long story short, he was the 
catalyst that was needed for the creation of this city, the power 
released to repair the damage done to this star brought me further and 
further away from my &#39;normal&#39; form as Tsukino Usagi and I became one 
with Sailor Moon, total immersion in my own power, a complete 
awakening. The others went through the same, and it was the tremendous 
power of the three outer senshi (Pluto had vanished altogether, it 
seemed) finally reaching into their souls that allowed my tiny, tiny 
crystal to expand and become the huge magnifying glass of a palace it 
is today. I don&#39;t need a crystal, or henshin phrases, or fancy sticks 
anymore, just a thought. The crystal focused my powers, allowed me to 
tap into the awesome power of the cosmos and the moon to help people. 
But what use is the crystal if it can&#39;t help everyone? It was that 
idea that created this palace. The power from the crystal softly flows 
through the world, suffusing it with just enough energy to allow the 
inner light of everyone here to shine through. People are wonderful, 
in the end. Just a tiny push, any excuse, and they will pour their 
soul into their life. 

I touch the immense pillar before me and tears cloud my vision. For a 
thousand years, I&#39;ve come down here to gaze at the bodies of three of 
my nearest, dearest, most beloved friends hang in the crystal. Their 
coffin is the palace, their coffin is the foundation upon which this 
world is built. Their strong, wonderful hearts allowed this world to 
be born, by taking a blast for me, by protecting me with the shining 
glory of their love they allowed me to help every person on this 
planet. It would be possible to remove them, the crystal is still 
under my control and will not shatter with their bodies gone, but I 
have no desire to see the breath gone from their lips, to feel cold 
skin touch mine, to release them from my heart.

Haruka, Michiru and Hotaru are dead, but in this coffin their Sailor 
Crystals remain sleeping eternally in their bodies, lending me 
strength and protecting this world. I believe more than a little of 
their influence has spread though, their minority group is less of a 
minority now. Their dreams of heaven must surely revolve around each 
other, filled with love and peace. 

I walk around a bit, trying to get a decent view of my three warriors. 
In death, they don&#39;t look at all like the fierce warriors they were. 
They each stand, eternal wings spread behind them, holding each other 
close. Through the layers, through the shimmering facets of ten feet 
of crystal, I can see tears stream down Neptune... Michiru&#39;s face as 
she holds her daughter to her heart with one arm and draws Haruka in 
for a kiss with the other, Haruka&#39;s gloved hand covering her fingers 
with so much tenderness. As I press myself to the crystal, I can see 
how she stands so proud and tall, enveloping her family in strong 
arms, protecting her princess. A hand on Hotaru&#39;s head, the youngest 
senshi&#39;s arms flung around their waists, her Glaive suspended a few 
meters behind her, Haruka&#39;s sky blue wings curling around her. Oh, 
what have I done?

I tear myself away and race upstairs to the gallery where the Inners, 
Pluto and Endymion lie. Endymion is resting now, far too tired to 
attempt a walk about. I was surprised that none of the others could 
ever master that trick, not even Rei, but maybe it was the Golden 
Crystal protecting him. I kneel at each of their tombs, watching their 
still faces. Oh, my loves, my precious, precious wonders. I collapse 
and weep over Venus&#39;s coffin, my tears shining as they rain over the 
cold, clammy shell. 

How selfish, how wretched I am! The fight with Sailor Chaos has taught 
me that much, as has my younger self. They deserve a slumber, real 
peace. Not this artificial, selfish idiocy! They&#39;d never ask to leave 
me, they&#39;d never leave me. They&#39;d rather lie between life and death 
for eternity. No chance for peace, no hope of ending it. Sobs rip from 
my chest, and I feel small arms around me.

&quot;Mama,&quot; Small Lady whispers, running a hand down my back. I wrap my 
arms around her neck and sob pitifully. While she was in the past for 
the last time, she felt the passage of a few hours in the centre of 
the Galaxy. Here, decades passed. Well over twenty long years. Why? I 
simply asked Pluto to wait until things were better here, until after 
the battle with Chaos was won to bring her back from her ordeal with 
Galaxia. 

More selfishness. I couldn&#39;t stand for her to see me so weak. Once she 
was ready to come back from the past, she was plonked further down the 
time line than I knew existed. Kinda. Pluto said she &#39;threw her in an 
inter-dimensional cupboard&#39; where time and space bend into a strange 
singularity and cease to have much meaning until I was finished with 
Chaos. In the blink of an eye, she missed the bloodiest, most 
terrifying battle I&#39;ve ever fought. I hated it, I hated having to be 
alone. I hated having to feign shock when Pluto revealed a disturbance 
in the past. 

Hmm... Pluto is a complicated case of time travel. Eternal, stranded 
in one place by the will of the Silver Millennium until her death here 
in Crystal Tokyo by Endymion&#39;s side, then reborn in the past to join 
the new force, ten scouts, one destiny. She helped in the battle with 
Galaxia and then popped out of existence entirely, it seemed, to give 
her predecessor time to sort out the bother with the Black Moon, then 
appearing here with no memory of the Galaxia Battle. I hate to think 
of what could happen to her at that Time Gate. The Necronomicon of 
doors. I don&#39;t know how she kept her mind intact at all. Maybe she 
didn&#39;t, maybe a complete snap of the psyche, a total loss of memory is 
the only way she can deal with remembering the possible future. 

But I digress. Once Small Lady got home, the first thing she asked was 
to see Hotaru-chan. And I showed her. Such tears. Inconsolable. Then, 
finally, I thought I could rest in my bed, but my heart won&#39;t let me. 
My dear, dear child. I love you so much, but I can never make you 
happy. I can&#39;t give you your best friend, I can&#39;t give you your aunts 
or your father. I don&#39;t think I can even give you myself anymore.

&quot;Mama?&quot; she whispers, sniffles and sobs still shake through me.

&quot;Small Lady, Usagi, I need to let them go. I need to let them be 
reborn.&quot;

She freezes. &quot;But they can&#39;t be reborn again until there&#39;s trouble,&quot; 
she voice trembles, &quot;that could be a long, long time.&quot; A thought grips 
her, and she strokes my hair. &quot;And they can&#39;t be reborn without you to 
guide their souls.&quot;

I&#39;d have to die too... Please, I&#39;m so tired. &quot;A thousand years is so 
long, Small Lady.&quot;

&quot;But, what about you and Papa and Hotaru-chan? What will I do without 
you?&quot;

Such pain in her voice, such innocence still. The same fate that 
befell me and my senshi... although technically Hotaru IS one of my 
senshi. I cling to her tightly. She loves the senshi of Death and 
Rebirth as much as Hotaru loves her, and she doesn&#39;t have a clue. 
&quot;We&#39;d never leave you, my darling.&quot; I press a kiss to her forehead. I 
don&#39;t want death, not at all, I want to laugh and play and be with my 
friends and family again. I don&#39;t want them to lie in stale tombs for 
the rest of eternity, dreaming of their useless princess. The only way 
I can give them some happiness is by allowing ourselves to die... to 
abandon my daughter with a promise that we will return.

What am I to do?

------------------------------------------------------------------

They can&#39;t walk around to say hello to me, but I can still visit their 
dreams. I lie back in bed and call on their Sailor Crystals. I can see 
their glow, I can see their shine! I&#39;m falling, falling into their 
dreams before I even hit the pillows.


I&#39;m in the Outer&#39;s mansion, dressed in my school uniform. I remember 
this! I came over to ask Haruka if she could let the mechanics in her 
garage fix Mamo-chan&#39;s car (what? You trust auto mechanics who aren&#39;t 
working under Haruka&#39;s shadow?).

&quot;Hello? Anyone home?&quot; Ooh, pink house slippers in my size with 
bunnies!

&quot;Ah, Usagi-chan!&quot; Michiru calls. She rushes out to greet me a few 
moments later, hair tied back, flour spotting her cheeks. &quot;How are 
you?&quot;

&quot;Fine, thank you. Have I come at a bad time?&quot; ooh, I&#39;m disturbing 
dinner!

&quot;Not at all! Would you like to stay for dinner?&quot; Ah, Michiru&#39;s such a 
good woman! Feeding me as well as everyone else.

&quot;If it&#39;s not imposing...&quot; Michiru&#39;s a very good cook, and I don&#39;t want 
to leave at all, but there&#39;s not use in being rude.

A gentle smile. &quot;Of course not, Usagi-chan. Come on in, and please 
excuse the mess.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s busy making a pie of some description, she&#39;s a great one for 
trying out new recipes that Mako-chan gives her. &quot;So, how&#39;s school?&quot;

&quot;Fine, thank you.&quot; Damn, Haruka and Michiru graduated last year. Lucky 
ducks. &quot;All those study sessions paid off!&quot;

Michiru raises an eyebrow as she kneads the dough. &quot;Ami-chan can get 
quite scary at times, ne?&quot; I nod emphatically, hair bobbing 
everywhere. &quot;But still, one year left and then you&#39;re free to do what 
ever you want.&quot;

I sigh. &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much I can do. I doubt I&#39;ll get into 
college.&quot;

&quot;If Haruka can manage, so can you.&quot;

My eyes widen. They&#39;re NOT perfect? Oh my. &quot;Haruka-san was bad in 
school?&quot;

&quot;Atrocious! She nearly failed most of her classes.&quot; A twinkle in 
Michiru&#39;s eye tells me that there&#39;s more to this!

&quot;So, what happened?&quot;

&quot;Well, she and I were both in juku, we weren&#39;t in the same middle 
school back then. One day the teacher called her to the board to 
answer an equation but she made a few mistakes and couldn&#39;t solve it. 
She threw the chalk at the board and stomped away in disgust.&quot; My eyes 
are like saucers, I bet. Michiru starts to giggle softly. &quot;It would 
have been dramatic, but then she went and slipped on the chalk, fell 
face first onto my desk and broke her nose.&quot;

&quot;Oh! That&#39;s terrible!&quot; 

&quot;I brought her to the hospital and well, one thing led to another...&quot;

I sigh happily, little hearts dancing around. &quot;That&#39;s lovely! Not too 
romantic though.&quot;

Michiru sits across the table from me and quirks an eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;ll 
tell you about our first date if you want romance.&quot;

So, many, many hours later we&#39;re still chatting away about the miracle 
of love that is Haruka and Michiru. Cute! Michiru&#39;s pie is in the 
oven, simmering away and stewing in its own juices (Irish stew pie, I 
think, with real Guinness!). Michiru&#39;s leaning back against the back 
of the couch, telling another tale about Haruka and her various 
antics. I swear if I ever need a favour from that girl again. I own 
her!

&quot;...and her little sister paled and ran away, her father belly laughed 
and her mother rolled her eyes.&quot;

&quot;It must have been scary! Telling your parents that you&#39;ve got a 
girlfriend. It&#39;s bad enough with a boyfriend...&quot;

&quot;It was, it was. But it was worth it.&quot; Michiru turns and looks at me. 
&quot;How does your mother feel about you being engaged already?&quot;

I shrug. &quot;She likes Mamo-chan, and he&#39;s growing on Papa. Shingo thinks 
he&#39;s really cool &#39;cause he&#39;s a college student. Papa still thinks 
he&#39;ll be too poor for years to support me though.&quot;

Michiru laughs. &quot;He won&#39;t be able to keep you in the luxury you&#39;re 
accustomed to, ne?&quot; Scowl. &quot;Don&#39;t make faces, it gives you wrinkles.&quot;

A change comes over her suddenly, she&#39;s much more solemn. &quot;You&#39;re a 
very lucky girl, Usagi. Very lucky.&quot; Sadness in her eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Michiru-san, I promise that you and Haruka-san can be 
together forever, I&#39;ll make sure!&quot;

Michiru reaches out and cups my cheek. She&#39;s everything I want to be 
and more. Elegant, refined, brave and intelligent. A warrior but 
filled with ethereal grace. I want to be more like her.

&quot;Thank you, Usagi.&quot; She leans forward and kisses me, directly on the 
lips (oh my! I&#39;ve kissed more girls in my life than guys... what kind 
of 
a reputation will I earn? Actually, it&#39;s nice to kiss girls, no 
stubble and they tend to brush their teeth more). She holds the kiss 
for a moment; soft, sweet lips gentle against mine and so very warm. I 
don&#39;t know why I tip my face and kiss her back, but I can&#39;t help it. 
The hunger and passion behind her ivory skin nips at me, drags me into 
her arms, begging to sate itself. I love them all so much, how can I 
deny my friends the thing that would make them happy? A low moan, a 
whimper, and Michiru breaks the kiss, her forehead touching mine. Oh 
kami-sama, what do I do now? Crap! 

She pulls back and looks me in the eye, sorrow shadowed in dark green 
depths, veiled by her obvious amusement at my apoplexy. &quot;Hmm, just 
making sure Haruka wasn&#39;t exaggerating about your kiss.&quot;

I do the only thing I can think of. I tackle her and embrace her 
around the waist, hugging tightly. She strokes my hair and hugs me 
back. I can&#39;t do this. It has to stay the way it&#39;s always been. I 
could never make them all happy, never. I&#39;m sorry, everyone, I&#39;m not 
strong enough. 

&quot;I promise I&#39;ll protect your happiness, Michiru-san.&quot;

&quot;My happiness is your happiness, Princess. Keep your heart filled with 
joy and I&#39;ll always be happy.&quot;

And suddenly, I&#39;m flying through scenes and people. 

Ami-chan blushing as I hug her for installing Windows 2000, laughing 
that I&#39;ll get great pleasure out of being able to play Sailor V at 
home and that&#39;ll be fun for everyone.

Rei-chan dressing me in a kimono for a festival we all went to in 
Hokkaido, laughing as I twirled in the light of the moon, wishing I 
was outside in the falling snow and telling me that she&#39;d love to 
watch me dance forever, that just watching me countered the chill of 
the snow.

Mako-chan carrying me to bed one night after I&#39;d fallen asleep on her 
couch during a movie and telling me not to worry about getting up in 
the morning, that she&#39;d see to my mama and papa and everything.

Minako-chan embracing me as she told me of her relationship with Rei, 
tears rolling over her cheeks as I whispered that her happiness was 
all that mattered and receiving an emphatic denial that mine was far 
more important.

Haruka giving me a piggy back to her car when I lost my favorite shoes 
at a water park and her telling me not to be such a forgetful kitten 
and to stop crying, that she was the one who should cry over having to 
spend money on a new pair of shoes for me.

Hotaru-chan crying on my shoulder when Chibi-Usa left for the last 
time, her young heart not able to name what was tearing it apart.

Setsuna massaging my feet when I was pregnant and bloated and telling 
me that I was to stay in bed for the last few weeks, that she&#39;d manage 
everything and make sure that everything went smoothly with my life.

Michiru holding me as I promised to let her spend eternity with her 
lover, because I was unable to give her the one she wanted most. 

I gasp as the images flood my brain and sit straight up in bed. Those 
dreams weren&#39;t even theirs! They were mine, my memories. They can&#39;t 
even dream anymore, their Sailor Crystals are too weak to keep even 
the simplest illusions going. 

I sink into my sheets, weeping. Oh, my poor senshi. What have I done 
to you all?

------------------------------------------------------------------

And it is done. They&#39;re dead now. I have left my daughter with the 
fate of the entire planet in her small hands. 

I have released all the senshi but Venus so far, and I sit poised to 
do so. Her coffin has melted away, leaving her lying serenely. I 
stroke her hair away from her face and kiss her cheek, then her lips, 
her cold, cold lips. My senshi, dead for so long and me, unwilling to 
give you up. I close my eyes and picture her flying away, golden wings 
spread around her. You loved me so much, and I loved you as well. How 
it killed me to see the pain of unrequited love in your eyes for a 
thousand years, in all your eyes. You all knew that I knew, but what 
could I have possibly said to have made it easier? Only lies, lies and 
half truths and building up hopes and crushing them. I couldn&#39;t do 
that to them, any more. I wish I could have kissed you even once, 
Minako-chan. You all would have thought I was lying if I&#39;d said that 
though, that I was just trying to make you all feel better. Maybe. 
Maybe my happiness depends on all you as much as yours depends on 
mine.

And her body is gone, a tiny breeze rustling the dust on the marble 
slab. I blacked out then, my heart too sore and tired to go on. 

Small Lady tucked me into bed, and stayed by my side until I died, one 
stormy night seven months later. I&#39;m sorry to leave you with the world 
on your shoulders, Usagi. But I can&#39;t stand this anymore. 

I&#39;m deeply in love with nine people and to end their suffering, I let 
them re-enter the cycles of life we go through. I have to go with 
them, I need to. 

------------------------------------------------------------------

We&#39;re all such complete fools. Everyone alive. We love the wrong 
people, the wrong people love us and it all ends in tears. I would 
pretend for a millennium that I felt nothing for you, because you 
could not give me your heart fully, or because I couldn&#39;t give mine. 
And there isn&#39;t a way to change this, except to stop loving and start 
hating.

But isn&#39;t it worth all the pain and hurt to see the ones you love 
smile? 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Enjoy? I hope so. Love is love, and it will kill you someday. </pre>
