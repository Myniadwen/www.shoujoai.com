<h1>Strange Bedfellows</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shooting147.html">Shootingstar147</a><br> </h2>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Mizuno-Kun!&quot; 
Naru called out as she caught up to her new found love.  Ami just 
smiled sweetly and waved at Naru before giving a small kiss on the lips 
as they headed towards their classroom.  Who would have thought 
that Ami Mizuno ,the shyest girl in class 1-1 and oh yeah Sailor Mercury 
would fall for a civilian and specifically one of her own gender!</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Wait...I think we need to back 
up a bit don&#39;t we...very well then let&#39;s do just that!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Two months earlier...</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">It 
was a rather dreary day in Tokyo.  The wind had been howling all 
day and the rain was unforgivable!  It was the kind of day that 
those that didn&#39;t have to go out didn&#39;t but if you did...God have mercy 
on your soul!  On this day four girls were gathered at the Hikawa 
Shrine huddled in a bedroom apparently having a study session.</font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;So 
you see Tuskino-san that&#39;s how you solve this problem.&quot;  One 
girl said to the other.  This girl was wearing glasses that some 
would say she honestly didn&#39;t need but her self-consciousness wouldn&#39;t 
allow her to part with them.  &quot;I see Ami-chan. &quot; Usagi 
replied to her friend as she applied what the genius girl showed her.</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;So 
then does that same thing apply to this problem?&quot; Another girl 
asked and when Ami looked at the problem she shook her head &quot;no&quot; 

and then showed her how to solve it.  The girl nodded as she saw 
how Ami went about it and was just floored with how she was able to 
grasp the subject matter in the textbook.  It was one of the qualities 
that the girls admired about Ami.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As 
night came and the weather let up the girls went their separate ways 
and to their respective homes.  When Ami got home of course there 
was a note from her mother on the dry erase board telling her that she 
wouldn&#39;t be home and that she was going to have to make something to 
eat for dinner.  Ami filed the note away in that LARGE filing cabinet 
they call her brain but as she was going to her room the light for the 
&quot;voicemail&quot; on the phone was blinking...who could that be?!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Mizuno-san...I&#39;m sorry to 
bother you but I need someone to talk to.  I&#39;m having a...&quot;problem&quot; 

with something and I just need someone to talk to.  I usually talk 
to Usagi about this but...</i></font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">[BEEEEEPPPPPPPPPP!!!!!]</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>(Naru-san is having issues 
with something and its something she usually talks to Tuskino-san about?  
I&#39;ll talk to her about it in the morning!)</i></font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That 
was the thought process that Ami had and it was a promise that she kept 
when she got to school(early as usual) and while she was going over 
some of the material that she knew they would be studying Naru came 
in when she saw Ami at her desk.  &quot;Mizuno-san...good morning!&quot; 
Naru exclaimed and Ami returned the greeting.  Naru had started 
to spend time talking to the girl genius before class everyday after 
the slumber party they had at Usagi&#39;s.  Ami truly felt honoured 
that Naru wanted to talk to her because outside of Usagi and Makoto 
not many students really spoke to her all that much.  It was definitely 
a good change of pace for sure!</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ami...when 
you aren&#39;t studying what do you do for fun?&quot; Naru asked and this 
got Ami to look up from her book.  To be honest it was something 
she never really had to think about because her whole life revolved 
around the text and she knew this.  What DID she like to do if 
she wasn&#39;t studying?  &quot;You know Osaka-san...I never thought 
about that.  My whole life has been based around studying and wanting 
to be my absolute best because of my goal of what I want to do when 
I get out of school.&quot; Ami explained and Naru nodded politely.  
This was all common knowledge to anyone that asked that question that 
Ami wanted to be a doctor like her mother.  Was there anyway to 
break that mold?</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
day went by rather uneventfully and Ami being Ami went up onto the roof 
and studied alone.  While Usagi and her friends having lunch Naru 
kept stealing glances over at where Ami sat and frowned at the fact 
that she still would try to isolate herself from the rest of the class 
during social periods.  This HAD to bother her even just a little...didn&#39;t 
it?</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Something 
wrong Naru-chan?&quot; Usagi asked but her friend just shook it off.  
Naru wasn&#39;t about to tell her friend the situation she was having or 
what it related to.  Naru was going to try her best to really get 
to know Mizuno Ami no matter what!</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Days 
blended into weeks and Naru made it a point every day before class to 
try to talk to Ami and not just about school either!  Naru had 
convinced herself that if she found a topic outside of schoolwork that 
Ami could relate to then maybe...just MAYBE she could start to get the 
&quot;Bookworm of 1-1&quot; to open up a bit to her.  Her big chance 
came when she walked into class one day and saw the Minidisc that Ami 
was listening to while studying.  Out of the corner of her eye 
Ami saw the young lady and politely took out the earbuds as Naru took 
what became her customary spot in front of Ami before class.</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Usagi 
told me you liked Minako&#39;s music.  I was surprised how into it 
you were when we had the slumber party awhile back.&quot; Naru stated 
and she could tell Ami was smiling a bit behind the book she was reading.  
Over the past few days Naru had begun to chip away at the wall that 
Ami had when she was around people she didn&#39;t know all that well and 
Naru was starting to become a good friend to her.  This &quot;daily 
ritual&quot; during the school days was something that Naru enjoyed 
and ,even though she didn&#39;t readily admit it, Ami enjoyed talking to 
Naru.  She was a nice girl whom meant well and knew that if she 
wasn&#39;t so damn busy with cram school she&#39;d definitely hang out with 
her some.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Usagi 
let me borrow hers for awhile but then I finally broke down and bought 
the disc for myself.  Its a good tool to use when I have to memorize 
different material or when I have a bad day.  I usually don&#39;t have 
anyone to talk to so when I&#39;m alone I usually just listen to the disc 
to help me concentrate.&quot; Ami explained and Naru just nodded.  
She was beginning to understand Ami but at the same time she silently 
wished that the girl would learn what fun was every so often!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>The following month</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Golden 
Week was had come and that meant that the kids had time off for a little 
while.  Ami was busy pouring over notes for school to try and keep 
pace if not get ahead of the class per usual when she got a phone call 
from Usagi.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Ami-chan&quot; 
Usagi started &quot;What are your plans for the day?&quot; she asked 
and when her friend told her Usagi mentally faceplamed.  &quot;Come 
on Ami you need to learn to have some fun in your life.  I&#39;m at 
the ice cream shop with Naru-chan and she wanted to know if you wanted 
to join us but you&#39;re busy so I&#39;ll tell her that you can&#39;t make it.&quot;  
Usagi sad somberly and hung up the phone.  As Ami listened to the 
dial tone at the other end a part of her felt AWFUL!  There was 
almost no logical explanation for her to have this feeling but at the 
same time it was nice that Naru thought of her.  Naru ,a civilian, 
was thinking of Ami Mizuno...did we enter the twilight zone or something 
here?</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Minutes 
later Ami closed up her textbook and got changed to go out.  As 
she did she sent Usagi a message that she would meet up with them at 
the park but NOT to tell Naru!  Odd behaviour much?  When 
Usagi got the text she started smiling and kept her promise to Ami to 
not tell her friend...which was hard because Naru was good at reading 
Usagi like a book.  This time it wasn&#39;t going to be so easy because 
of the fact that Usagi found a way to divert her attention every time 
she got close.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">When 
Usagi and Naru got to the park Ami was waiting for the girls at the 
entrance patiently.  This got Naru to show her &quot;WTH?!&quot; 
face that quickly turned into a smile as the trio made their way in 
and had an absolute ball!  Naru and Ami did the bottle toss and 
Ami nailed the targets on the first shot which got the attention of 
the attendant and Naru couldn&#39;t help but be impressed.  What else 
was this girl good at?!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
trio would get to find out as they did the various games and Ami had 
a hard time carrying some of the prizes she got.  One of the games 
she won a big plushie that Naru joked looked like her in a way and when 
she won it Ami gave it to her new found friend.  This was the kind 
of day that Naru wanted Ami to have and slowly Ami started to let her 
guard down around the girl.  When the day was over the girls were 
BEAT!  It was the kind of day that after you get home your head 
hits the pillow and you go &quot;night night&quot; real quick!  
All three girls did just that but when Ami went off to dreamland her 
dreams started revolving around her new friend in Naru Osaka!</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Three days later...</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The 
class was given a pop quiz and naturally Ami passed!  Usagi had 
to do cleaning duty and Naru stayed behind to help her.  Ami had 
gone off to cram school and this gave Naru a chance to try and talk 
to her best friend about her newest...&quot;problem&quot;.  &quot;Usagi...what 
did/do you do when you like someone?  How easy is it for you to 
express yourself when you have feelings for someone and they don&#39;t know 
you like them?&quot; Naru asked and this line of questioning was unusual 
for Naru.  Sure she glanced at pictures of boys that she admired 
but this sounded different somehow.  What was going on?</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Well 
Naru...I think the first thing you have to do is know yourself first 
if the feelings are real.  If they are then you have to figure 
out how to come out and tell the person you like how you honestly feel.  
The hard part is if the person you like doesn&#39;t like you then it gets 
scary because you could lose that friend...make sense?&quot; Usagi asked 
and Naru nodded as the finished up on the cleaning duty and Naru had 
her mission now:  Tell Ami Mizuno how she felt about her!</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Two Days Later...</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes rehearsing helps!</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Its 
not that the conversation didn&#39;t go well...it would have if Naru didn&#39;t 
stumble over what she was going to tell her new friend.  The time 
was perfect as it had been before school started and Naru was talking 
to Ami about what was getting covered and she asked to see Ami&#39;s notes(she 
had legitimately forgotten her notebook for one of the classes) when 
the subject of &quot;crushes&quot; came up but it was Ami that brought 
it up!  This caught Naru so off guard that she couldn&#39;t say anything 
and the rest of the day was kind of awkward.  When lunch came Usagi 
had asked Naru if she got to tell the person she liked how she felt 
but Naru dodged the question.  She was so ashamed at how she acted 
around Ami that she didn&#39;t want to talk about it.</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Osaka Residence</i></font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Naru 
sat at her desk almost in tears!  Its not easy for one to admit 
how they feel about someone but it was even HARDER because in this case 
the person that she was crushing on was a fellow female classmte!  
How in the [BLEEP] does that work?!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Naru 
didn&#39;t have much time for moping about it when she glanced out of a 
window and saw a light on over by the ice cream parlor not too far from 
her house.  Something was happening because it looked almost like 
a light show over there and her curiosity?  Well it got the best 
of her!</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;SUPREME THUNDER!!!&quot;</font> <br>

</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!!!!&quot;</font> <br>
</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Sailor 
Mercury and Jupiter were fighting a monster that Nephrite had brought 
out but this was a tough bastard!  It was absorbing a lot of the 
attacks they threw at it and even Mars was having trouble.  Just 
how tough WAS this thing?!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Naru 
cursed herself for not being all THAT athletic when she ran and got 
to the parlor and ended up behind the monster.  Mercury noticed 
this and told her to back away but it was too late as the monsters started 
going after Naru and Mercury led the chase after the youma.  This 
was honestly the first time that she remembered chasing a youma because 
it was going after a civilian....why?!</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That 
thought process would be put on hold as the monster trapped Naru and 
after draining a significant amount of energy threw her like a rag doll 
into a set of steel girders that were near a construction site!  
This pissed off Mercury to the point where she delivered an attack that 
was about as cold at dry ice to the creature!  When Sailor Moon 
got there and saw what Mercury did she didn&#39;t say a thing...didn&#39;t need 
to either as the piece came into place as she hit the &quot;Twilight 
Flash&quot; and Mercury knelt down next to the unconscious Naru.  
The last time she felt like this was when she almost killed Sailor Moon 
as Dark Mercury but why now?</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">That 
night at the hospital where Saeko was on the night shift Ami brought 
in Naru and took her to one of the vacant rooms to let her rest.  
She would have taken her back HOME but trying to explain whom she was 
to the mother might not have been easy considering she would have probably 
shown up as Mercury and NOT Ami.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">A 
few hours later and Naru woke up but still fairly weak to the point 
where she didn&#39;t bother sitting up.  This was going to have to 
be the time to tell Ami because if she didn&#39;t then when would be the 
&quot;appropriate&quot; time after this?  &quot;Mizuno-san&quot; 
Naru started &quot;I&#39;m sorry about tonight.  I saw that light coming 
from the parlor and I let my curiosity get the best of me.&quot; she 
finished quietly but Ami just shook her head and placed her hand in 
Naru&#39;s before speaking.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I 
don&#39;t suppose I can convince you that what you saw was an illusion can 
I?&quot; Ami asked and Naru just gently shook her head.  Ami knew 
that if she told Naru who she was then she would be putting a civilians 
life in danger.  What could she do now though?  &quot;The 
person you may have seen attack that monster before you blacked out...that 
was me.  I promise you that when you feel better I&#39;ll tell you 
anything you want to know but at the same time can you keep it between 
us?&quot; Ami asked and Naru complied.  She was starting to get 
Ami&#39;s trust and she didn&#39;t want to lose it.  This was the LEAST 
she could do for her</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">As 
the conversation continued it was for the most part light-hearted and 
small talk but then the subject came up that both girls dreaded and 
Ami ,oddly enough, was the first to bring it up!  &quot;Naru...when 
you said in a message a few months ago you wanted to talk about something...was 
it about me?&quot; Ami asked and Naru knew she was busted then.  
How to go about talking about a subject that could do irreparable damage 
to their fragile friendship.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;I&#39;d 
be lying to you if I told you it wasn&#39;t Ami.&quot; Naru explained and 
Ami just listened for the explanation to come &quot;Do you remember 
the slumber party we had over Usagi&#39;s house?&quot; Naru asked and Ami 
nodded waiting to see where this was going &quot;When you were singing 
I thought you were absolutely adorable and slowly my perception of you 
started changing.  A day or two later and when you reverted back 
to your old habit of isolation I was concerned because I think you are 
a good girl and someone that needs a person to talk to at the least 
but maybe down the line become something more.  I...had chased 
after boys most of my time on this planet admittedly but something about 
you captured a place in my heart.  I&#39;ll never be able to explain 
it I don&#39;t think but you are someone I honestly and truly care about 
and I don&#39;t want to see you get hurt.&quot; Naru explained and b the 
time she was finished Ami was by her side sitting in a chair next to 
the bed.</font> <br></p>

<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">&quot;Osaka-san 
I...I&#39;ve felt the same way since that night!  I didn&#39;t know how 
to express it to you or anyone in the school because ,to be frank, there&#39;s 
still people that perceive me as a snobbish bookworm but honestly I&#39;m 
just trying to do my best in school.  You understand that right?&quot; 
Ami asked and Naru just smiled.  She wouldn&#39;t expect anything less 
from the whiz kid of the class and the fact that Ami reciprocated Naru&#39;s 
feelings made her feel good inside.</font> <br></p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">And this brings us to...</font> <br>
</p>
<p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><i>Present Day...</i></font> <br>

</p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Naru 
hadn&#39;t said much to anyone about her and Ami dating...hell it took a 
good while for Usagi to figure it out but when she did she was quite 
happy for them and made a promise to not tell too many people in the 
school.  It was a promise that she kept even when Rei asked about 
Ami going to the jewelery store a little more frequently than normal 
but Usagi found a way to deflect the questioning to something else.  
She didn&#39;t know how Rei would take it and made certain to not leave 
any hints about it after the fact.</font> <br></p>
<p>      <font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Was 
it a hard pill for Saeko to swallow?  Not really because when she 
saw how much Naru truly cared for her daughter she became an accepted 
member of the family.  It was something that Naru would treasure 
always and whenever she woke up in the morning she did so knowing one 
thing:  She was the one that captured Ami&#39;s heart!</font></p>
