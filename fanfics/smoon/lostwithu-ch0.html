<p><strong>Setting</strong>: <strong>AU</strong> ,even if there'll be a couple of Sailor Senshis, youmas and stuff like that.</p>
<p><strong>(Long) Author's note (please don't skip it)</strong>:  This crazy idea came to me as I watched the first couple of episodes of  'Lost' from which I borrowed the setting, while the characters are from  Sailor Moon.</p>
<p>I hate dub names but I had to use some of them cause  plot needed it (on an international flight people are supposed to be  from different countries). I used English dub names cause I thought  they'd be familiar for a larger amount of you readers. But for those  who aren't here's a little reminder:</p>
<p>Lita: Makoto</p>
<p>Mina: Minako</p>
<p>Serena: Usagi</p>
<p>Darien: Mamoru</p>
<p>Molly: Naru</p>
<p><em>Italics</em> are flashbacks.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING!</strong>: Even if in the first pages it can seem otherwise this is an Haruka and Michiru fic, so H&amp;M fans, please be patient!</p>
<p><strong>WARNING 2!</strong>:  I'm not a great fan of Seiya, so, if you are one, please forgive me for  fooling around with him, I needed to... and I wanted to either.</p>

<strong>PROLOGUE
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Tokyo airport, 9.26 AM.</strong></p>
<p>The  departures hall was full of people ready to leave Tokyo. Someone was  going on business trips, someone was going on holiday after a year or  so of hard working, someone was going back home after their tour of  Japan. Some of them were happy to leave, others quite the contrary.  Some of them were desperate or maybe just disappointed.</p>
<p>Amid them  there was a blonde young woman with a red ribbon in her long hair, who  was giggling sillily talking with two handsome and slightly annoyed  stewards. A similar situation was taking place just a couple of meters  from her where a bald and short old man in traditional Japanese  clothing was ogling every pretty girl passing.</p>
<p>In the big hall  big and little dramas were played every single day and today wasn't an  exception. In fact a tall brunette with a ponytail had tears running  down her cheeks as she looked out the wall-wide window at the front of  the departures block, and at the same time in the waiting area a  middle-age woman with blue shoulder length hair and small glasses was  pacing anxiously. They were both distressed but for very different  reasons.</p>
<p>There were people who tried to stay unnoticed like the  two men in the far corner, one had his hands uncomfortably joined  together on his belly and covered with a jacket and the other was  showing to his companion the black piece of iron he hid under his coat;  there was someone else, on the contrary, who tried to get the attention  that was denied to her. That was the black-haired little girl pulling  her father's sleeve while the man with white hair and glasses mumbled  insanely something to himself and took notes on a small note-book. But  there were some who didn't passed unnoticed and just liked it that way.  The three well-dressed young men were signing autographs before a small  flashing crowd of fans and reporters. And beside them there was a  beautiful aqua-haired woman that was equally signing autographs while  one of the three pop-idols circled her shoulder with his arm and had a  smug smile on his face. She didn't seem interested in her adoring fans  nor in her self-satisfied colleague, she was looking in the distance  somewhere over the tickets office.</p>
<p>Big rooms have their own  noise, it's like a buzz consisting in all the voices and sounds  produced by people and objects. So nobody heard the thick glasses  impacting with the ground. The spike-haired owner crouched to pick it  up but was anticipated by a blue-haired girl. He managed an almost  timid 'thank you' before she was gone. What was audible even from a  certain distance was the quite heated quarrel that was taking place at  the ticket office where an handsome tall blonde was arguing with a poor  clerk. He then cooled down and tried another strategy. He wore an  incredibly charming smile, and soon obtained whatever he was asking for  by the blushing clerk.</p>
<p>Crowded room are the best places to  embarrass oneself or those who are with you. That was the case of a  blonde woman in her early twenties with two strange pigtails on her  head and her sweatdropping fianc√©. She was eating ice-cream with such  enthusiasm that her hands, mouth and cheeks were a sticky mess. But  sometimes what one considers embarrassing another can consider just <em>cute.</em> And cuteness was what a young man crouched on the ground involved in a  game with two little kids was inspiring for the beautiful black haired  girl in traditional white and red clothes watching.</p>
<p>Where  technology is like a philosophy the image of a blonde man reading an  old-fashioned letter made of nervous black handwriting on creased white  paper made a good contrast with the elegant tanned woman in a business  suit, with her laptop in front of her.</p>
<p>All that people ignoring  everything about each other could be in a very near future  travel-mates, but there were someone who had her travel-mate already  with her in a wonderful way. That was the young, pretty, pregnant woman  with her shoulder-length brown hair tied up with a dark ribbon. She had  taken off her shoes and was complaining about her puffy feet to no one  in particular. In her case the little pulsating life growing inside of  her was probably enough to make her feel like she wasn't alone.</p>
<p>Every  kind of people, rich and poor, happy and sad, brilliant and plain, old  and young. Everyone had their own story to tell, their secrets to hide,  their life to live, their death waiting for them.</p>
<p>And all of them had a flight to take.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong>Tokyo airport, 10.30 AM</strong>
<p><em>&quot;Attention please, last warning, flight number 5186 bound to New York JFK is now boarding at gate number twenty-three...&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Serena! Hurry, we're gonna lose it!&quot; Yelled a pretty blonde girl with a big red ribbon in her very long hair.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen,  I'm sorry for the inconvenience.&quot; An obviously embarrassed, tall, black  haired man said in an unsure Japanese to the clerk who had a couple of  flight papers in her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;PUFF PANT mmhcomiiing!  Umpharien...ove, fis...GULP...Japanese... CHOMP... candy...mmh...are...  CHOMP... pho goooood. GULP! Here I am, all ready to go home!&quot; She said  with a satisfied and disarming smile to the embarrassed clerk.</p>
<p>&quot;I  wish you have a good flight back to New York...&quot; Said the young  Japanese clerk with a sigh of relief, as the three left her to board.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong>Flight 5186, 10.45 AM, economy class.</strong>
<p>The roaring of the engine was increasing by the minutes, the  passengers had already buckled their belts. The flight was ready to  take off.</p>
<p>&quot;Calm down Mom, it's going to be ok. There's nothing to  be scared about. You know, the odds this flight could fall are very  low, just the 2.&quot; Said the blue-haired girl to a very pale woman sit  beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you dear, now I'll be ok, I just have to try  not thinking about that 2...&quot; The woman tried to lighten the spirit but  maintained her deadly grip on the armrest and her look never left the  seat before her.</p>
<p>&quot;Now you're going irrational, I did it several  times during these years and the flight never fell.&quot; The younger woman  said returning her yes to the thick volume on her lap.</p>
<p>&quot;Sometimes you're so rational that you don't make any sense, Ami-chan.&quot; Her mother said with an incredulous smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Right  now I can just think about all the hours I'm gonna spend stuck in this  seat and how big my feet will be when we'll be finally in New York!&quot;  Intervened a young woman obviously pregnant, talking in English.</p>
<p>&quot;How many hours?&quot; Asked the already scared woman in a heavy accented English.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh!&quot;  The girl was taken aback by the woman's question cause she didn't  thought they would have talked to her in her language. &quot;Well 13, maybe  14.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;GULP!&quot; Was the only sound the woman made, while her  daughter sweatdropped gaping at the girl at the other side of the  narrow corridor.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually we'll land after a flight 12 hours  long.&quot; A timid voice said from right behind the pregnant woman, but  nobody seemed to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, I'm Molly, by the way,  and I'm not alone like you can see.&quot; The brunette said as she reached  out for a friendly handshake while with her other hand pointed to her  swollen belly.</p>
<p>&quot;Dr. Mizuno Kimiko, nice to meet you.&quot; The blue  haired woman shook the proffered hand. &quot;And this is Mizuno Ami, my  daughter.&quot; She said pointing at the short haired young woman sit beside  her.</p>
<p>&quot;Nice to meet you, Molly-san.&quot; She said in a perfect English.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi!&quot; The other girl just said with a big smile.</p>
<p>Right behind them a young shy man with thick rounded glasses leaned back in his seat sighing.</p>
<p>A  couple of rows up to the front the 'Japanese candy lover' was clinging  to her boyfriend's arm almost painfully, though he kept on smiling  stoically.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh Darien, love, I'm so scared! If something happens  you'll save me, right?&quot; She blinked dreamily, her light blue eyes  sparkling. Darien sweatdropped as he replied.</p>
<p>&quot;If the airplane falls down I don't think there will be nothing I could do about it, Meatball-head...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Whaaaaa!  I don't want to crash down with this airplane! Whaaaaa!&quot; Serena cried  out, her eyes watering rapidly. Soon she had her cheeks streaked by big  tears.</p>
<p>&quot;Serena, love, there's no need to be so loud. I promise  I'll be here with you and I won't let anything happen to you. It's that  ok?&quot; He reassured her squeezing her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, stop it Serena!  You're not scared, as soon as we'll take off you will be asleep  drooling on poor Darien's shoulder like it was during the outward  journey.&quot; Said the blonde girl sit at her other side.</p>
<p>&quot;That's not  true, Mina! You're mean. I was just tired, and I don't drool!&quot; She  turned towards her boyfriend for confirmation but the young man  remained silent blushing furiously. &quot;Whaaaaaa!&quot;</p>
<p>Darien circled his girlfriend's shoulder trying to calm her again, glaring at Mina disapprovingly.</p>
<p>Mina shrugged and turned to the boy sit at the other side of the aisle smiling apologetically.</p>
<p>&quot;She's  not that way all the time... well, ok she is but she's a good girl.&quot;  She suddenly noticed the blonde boy was definitely good-looking with  green eyes and freckles spread on his straight nose. &quot;Hello I'm Mina,  nice to meet you.&quot; As soon as she said that she thought he could have  not understood her and she had a sigh of relief when he answered her in  a good English.</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, I'm Furuhata Motoki, and it's my pleasure.&quot; He smiled kindly to her.</p>
<p>'It'll be a nice voyage...' She thought smiling in return.</p>
<p>A  few rows behind a tall brunette was thinking the exact opposite way. A  fat, sweaty, gray-haired man was talking endlessly to her since they  had boarded. He was invading her personal space and she started to  think it wasn't so involuntarily.</p>
<p>&quot;...cause business is like  dealing with dogs or women, you have to make clear who's on charge from  the very beginning then is just a 'big slick'. I just did that with  these Japanese and I closed my deal soon and neatly. There's no  challenge for 'Big Harold' here!&quot; He said... to her chest while his  hand slipped dangerously toward her thigh. She grasped the  soon-to-be-offending appendage and replaced it on the armrest. Her  patience was wearing off rapidly.</p>
<p>Fortunately the take-off run  started and he was forced still in his seat, but soon the plane was  horizontal again and again he started. When he offered to help her  unbuckling her safety-belt and didn't wait for her answer she gripped  on his hand and twisted it painfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Ow! Ow! Hey! What are you  doing?&quot; 'Big Harold' turned in 'Big Red Harold' cause the deep shade of  his face contorting in a grimace of pain.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, I was  thinking that if you dirty obtuse pervert bastard are the important  businessman you keep telling you are, why aren't you in the business  class? You loser! And, you know, next time you want to talk with me you  better look at my face!&quot; She then let go of his hand glaring menacingly  at the surprised man.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me?&quot; A lightly accented voice from  her left got her attention. She turned still glaring, when she realized  that, she quickly smiled reassuringly at the black haired girl a the  other side of the aisle.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See, my <em>old</em> grandfather would prefer sitting on the seat near the aisle and... you  know, me too, so I was wondering if you would be so kind to switch your  seat with him.&quot; The girl said winking knowingly at her.</p>
<p>&quot;What?... Oh! Well... sure!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you, you're very kind.&quot; The traditional clothed girl said, then in  Japanese, &quot;Grandpa! You hear that? This nice girl has accepted to make  you have the seat you wanted.&quot; She had to elbow the already sleeping  old man.</p>
<p>&quot;What...? Rei-chan what are you talking about?&quot; The  short, bald man asked sleepily, but his granddaughter was already  standing, gesturing him to stand up. He just did what he was asked to  do. Slightly dumbfounded he watched a tall brunette taking his former  seat as her granddaughter leaned down and kissed his cheek.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank  you grandpa, you're a gentleman.&quot; He was even more puzzled. Then he  just made the conclusion he wasn't able to understand young people  anymore and just took his place in the opposite row, when the brunette  had been sit before. His short frame let him not to be bothered by  Harold hugeness and in a few seconds he was asleep again.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you! You're my savior...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hino Rei, and you're welcome.&quot; The black-haired girl said.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm Lita. But your grandfather won't...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  don't worry,&quot; she pointed at him. &quot;See? He's already asleep, and he's  absolutely capable to stay that way all the way to New York.&quot;</p>
<p>Lita turned in the old man's direction and just shrugged, &quot;Thank you again, then.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hi,  I'm Kumada Yuiichiro, nice to meet you Lita-san.&quot; A young dark-haired  man said in a rather bad English bowing his head to her from Rei's  other side.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi!&quot; She waved back to him smiling.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Now  don't make any trouble, asshole. I'm gonna take a nap.&quot; A man with  gray-streaked hair said as he took a travel-pillow and placed it behind  his head trying to gain a comfortable position.
<p>&quot;And how do you think I can escape? I'm not Houdini.&quot; The long  haired man sitting beside him said with an annoyed tone pointing at his  left hand.</p>
<p>&quot;You can never know. And I meant not to pull with your hand, by the way. Just sit tight.&quot; The other answered closing his eyes.</p>
<p>His companion just glared at him and leaned back on his seat.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong>Flight 5186 on board, 10.20 AM, first class.</strong>
<p>&quot;I could have used another couple of days at home, actually... that  was really rude of Shineda-san, make us move so suddenly, don't you  think Michiru-san?&quot; A young man in a very stylish pale green suit said.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I don't care wherever or whenever I move if I'm in your adorable  company, Michiru-chan.&quot; Another young man with black curly hair and a  very long pony-tail pointed out to the beautiful woman that was walking  beside him.</p>
<p>&quot;You'll like New York, Yaten, all those boutiques...  And you Seiya, stop being a moron, Michiru-san doesn't need to hear  your sloppiness... Uh, Michiru-san, are you ok?&quot; A third man asked when  the young aqua-haired woman hadn't acknowledged his two brothers. He  was very tall, with very long brown hair neatly combed backward and in  a pony-tail just like the other two.</p>
<p>Michiru was staring intently  ahead at the plane entrance. There stood a tall blonde writing  something while a flight-attendant blushed furiously. She didn't know  what had got her attention but there was something weird and curious  about that person, he was the same she had observed before in the hall  arguing and then convincing the clerk at the ticket-box. He wore kakis,  a white dress shirt and sailing shoes. He had a black little suitcase  and when he turned to make his way into the plane she had a shot of  sunglasses and a intriguing profile.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-san?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!  Oh, gomen Taiki-san I think I got distracted. What were you saying?&quot;  She said waving back her aqua strands in an incredibly sexy and  disarming way.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my! So it's true!&quot; An excited hostess said seeing the four person approaching and getting involuntarily their attention.</p>
<p>&quot;The  Threelights! And that's Michiru Kaioh!&quot; Another hostess said barely  containing herself. &quot;That's our lucky day, first Tenoh-san and now...  This job is worth it, after all!&quot;</p>
<p>That was how the two  flight-attendants greeted them when they finally reached the plane.  Then in a more professional way, &quot;Welcome on board, I wish you enjoy  your journey on our plane.&quot; One of the hostesses said smiling at them.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  a real pleasure to have you on our flight.&quot; Said the other, obviously  excited, she held a piece of paper in her hand and handed it to Seiya  with dreamy eyes. &quot;Can I... ehm... can I have an autograph, please?&quot;</p>
<p>The young man smiled charmingly at her, took the handed piece of paper and signed it with the pen Taiki has held out for him.</p>
<p>&quot;Me  too, please?&quot; The other hostess said handing Michiru another sheet of  paper, &quot;I'm a great fan of you.&quot; She smiled blushing, her look cast  downward timidly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; Michiru took the offered paper and pen, &quot;What's your name?&quot; She asked the girl sweetly.</p>
<p>&quot;I-It's Yumi.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very cute name, Yumi.&quot; She said signing a dedication on the paper.</p>
<p>&quot;Th-Thank you, you're so nice to me.&quot; The girl answered blushing even more, &quot;Elegant, talented and so nice...&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  didn't blush cause she rarely do that, but was very pleased about the  sincerity and naiveness of the young attendant. She then said good-bye  and walked down the aisle to take her seat while her three travel-mates  were still engaged in the autograph session.</p>
<p>When she reached her  assigned seat she picked up her Luis Vuitton beauty-case to put it in  the baggage-box above, but the weight was suddenly lift from her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot; Was her surprised comment.</p>
<p>&quot;May  I help you?&quot; An incredibly husky voice came from behind her. When  Michiru turned around she found herself face to face - or should I say  'face to chest' - with the mysterious blonde. And chest it was indeed!</p>
<p>'Well,  now I know what was the ambiguity I sensed before.' Michiru thought  when she realized that chest was way softer than a man's chest was  supposed to be.</p>
<p>&quot;Arigato.&quot; She said smiling up at the tall blonde who was still stretched up.</p>
<p>&quot;It  was my pleasure.&quot; The blonde said. She smiled and Michiru couldn't help  but think how charming that smile was. She had to keep herself from  blushing and giggling like a school-girl with a crush.</p>
<p>'Well, that was something! It was so long since I felt this way...'</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan,  is everything alright?&quot; Seiya was right behind her and was glaring at  the blonde from over her shoulder. He circled her waist with his arm  and she felt suddenly annoyed by his presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; was  her cold replay to him, then softening her voice, &quot;Thank you again, I'm  Kaioh Michiru. It was very kind of you...?&quot; She lent her hand to the  blonde who took it and instead of shaking it bowed down and brushed her  lips against the back of the delicate appendage.</p>
<p>&quot;Enchanted Kaioh-san. I'm Tenoh Haruka.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's my pleasure Tenoh-san.&quot; She bowed.</p>
<p>&quot;Ehm...&quot;  Seiya had observed the scene from right behind them and was getting  upset at the boldness of the blonde. He had recognized her and he  didn't like it at all. &quot;We better take our seats, we could be in the  way.&quot; And pulled Michiru back toward Yaten and Taiki.</p>
<p>&quot;Good bye.&quot; Michiru managed to say to the blonde before she was pulled away.</p>
<p>&quot;Good bye.&quot; Was the whispered response.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong>Flight 5186, 10.000 feet of altitude, 01.43 PM, first class.</strong>
<p>'Beautiful...' That had been the only word in her head for the past three hours.</p>
<p>&quot;Beautiful!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What!&quot;  Haruka was snapped out from her reverie state. Someone had somewhat  voiced out her thoughts. She turned to her left where the voice had  come from. There was a little girl about six, seven years old who was  stretching up trying to take a look out of the small window. They were  above a big bank of clouds and the sun was shining bright on the white  surface. The black haired girl was looking in awe at the fluffy things  bathed in the morning sun.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like whipped-cream!&quot; She was  stretching up trying to look past the white-haired man sitting beside  her. He was leaned forward writing on a note-book and mumbling from  time to time. The little girl never said anything to him and he seemed  not to notice her.</p>
<p>'Or <em>care</em>.' Haruka thought watching the scene from her seat just across the small corridor.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, you can look this way, it's just as beautiful.&quot; She said to the little girl, who turned to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, arigato.&quot;</p>
<p>The  girl had violet eyes that shone for the sun from the window, her black  hair ended just above her shoulders and framed her very pale and pretty  face. A smile was spreading adding brightness to that face.</p>
<p>Haruka  found herself smiling in return, there was something endearing about  that kid, maybe it was the sweet smile or those big eyes but Haruka  found herself wondering how, what seemed to be her father could be so  engrossed in whatever he was doing instead of that lovely child.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems snow, too, doesn't it?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  yes. And I think it would be as wet and cold as the snow to the touch.&quot;  Haruka commented and soon the little girl's eyes shifted from the  window to her.</p>
<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mhh... I think it is, I never  touched a cloud actually.&quot; Haruka answered suddenly feeling self  conscious under the suspicious and incredibly serious look of her young  interlocutor.</p>
<p>&quot;I never touched the snow, either. I'm not allowed  to go out when it's snowing.&quot; The girl said, and Haruka saw a great  sadness, so out of place in those eyes that were just too young.</p>
<p>While Haruka was still thinking about that the little girl gasped and turned to the rows on the back.</p>
<p>&quot;That strange woman is watching you.&quot; She commented.</p>
<p>&quot;Who?&quot;  Haruka leaned up to look over the headrest of her large first-class  seat. In the distance there was a woman with long dark hair, tanned  face and piercing garnet eyes. Their look met for a moment before the  plane had a vigorous shrug and Haruka was threw back in her seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Whoa!&quot;  She said to the little girl who looked a little bit scared. &quot;Don't  worry it's normal, just a turbulence.&quot; She smiled reassuringly at her  and sit back.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes the plane shook again  even more forcefully. The frame started to tremble and they heard a  'ding', then the 'belt sign' went on.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen,  the pilot has switched on the 'fasten seat-belts' sign. Please return  to your seats and fasten your seat-belts.&quot;</em>The speaker above their head said.</p>
<p>Haruka  looked surprised at the seemingly unaware man beside the little girl  then leaned to her to help her fastening her seat-belt.</p>
<p>&quot;All right, now sit tight Hime-chan, it will be alright.&quot; Then she hurried fastening her own belt.</p>
<p>The flight attendant walked along the aisle making sure everybody was sitting with the belts fastened.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse  me, sir. You have to close your writing-table and fasten your  seat-belt, please.&quot; She said to the white-haired man. He seemed to stop  for an instant but never looked at her, then he just went back at his  work.</p>
<p>&quot;Sir, please. We are in a turbulence.&quot; She said stumbling to maintain her equilibrium while the plane shook again.</p>
<p>&quot;Papa?  Please, you have to close that and fasten your belt.&quot; The little girl  said softly but firmly and suddenly she seemed way older than she  looked. She put her hand on her father's and managed to close the  table, then she took the belt ends and held them to him. He then seemed  to acknowledge her, he took the belt and fastened it. The only one eye  that could be seen behind his thick and strange glasses looked blankly  into space and a shiver run through Haruka's spine at that view.</p>
<p>Suddenly  the plane hit some rough turbulence and the people who didn't fastened  their belt were flied out of their seats and hit the ceiling. Screams  were heard and loud 'thuds' caused by people hitting the floor and  objects falling. The turbulence continued and the alarms blared, then  the overhead oxygen masks fell from their compartments.</p>
<p>Haruka  took her mask and breathed deeply then she turned and saw the little  girl trying to reach for her own mask, her father kept on staring into  space. The blonde leaned out to help the little girl but her belt held  her in place preventing her from grabbing for the elusive mask. She  looked at the terrified girl and decided to unfasten her belt to help  her despite the danger, but when she was about to do it she heard a  loud groan of metal and a screech. Then the very loud rumble of air was  accompanied by the intense sensation of being sucked back. She looked  powerless at the little girl who was screaming but she could only see  her open mouth, cause any sound was engulfed by the horrible roaring  from the hind part of the plane.</p>
<p>Haruka saw a man flying to the  back of the plane, she leaned down her head sheltering it behind the  seat in front of her to prevent herself to be hit by flying objects.  Then a flash passed through her mind and she found herself raising her  head and scanning the situation a few rows ahead. The last thing she  saw was a glance of aqua hair waving from behind the headrest of a seat.</p>
