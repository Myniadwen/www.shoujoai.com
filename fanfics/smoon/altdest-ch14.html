<h1>Altered Destinies (part 14 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/altdest-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Rei leaned over the table, as if she was conveying a deep secret, &quot;I 
saw Luna coming home earlier today, and when I called out to her, she 
completely ignored me.&quot; She added thoughtfully, &quot;Luna looked really 
happy.&quot;

Ami frowned slightly in thought, &quot;I wonder what&#39;s going on with her 
lately. I noticed she hasn&#39;t been around Minako&#39;s house much lately 
either.&quot;

Mokoto looked over at Rei thoughtfully, &quot;Coming home happy. I wonder 
if she&#39;s in love?&quot;

&quot;Love?&quot; Usagi repeated happily, a goofy smile on her pretty face.

Artemis jerked up on hearing that, then he slumped down again. Minako 
looked at him in concern as she said, &quot;It may not be love, you know.&quot; 
She thought quickly, &quot;I mean, there&#39;s lots of other things that make 
girls happy!&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Mokoto scoffed. &quot;It&#39;s not like Luna can have chocolate 
or something. No, I think its love! But I wonder who it is?&quot;

Artemis slinked slowly out of the room, his tail dragging behind him.

&quot;Be a little more sensitive,&quot; Natsuna chided them softly. &quot;You know 
how Artemis feels about Luna,&quot; she said quietly.

&quot;What? What?&quot; Usagi said, sounding honestly perplexed as she looked 
back and forth between her friends.

Minako looked at her in disbelief. &quot;You mean you didn&#39;t notice that 
Artemis is in love with Luna?&quot; she asked Usagi.

Usagi sweatdropped. &quot;But I just thought they were friends,&quot; she said 
with a cute little frown on her face.

&quot;Baka,&quot; Minako sighed, even as Usagi facefaulted.

Outside, Luna slipped out of the building, but came to a sudden stop. 
Artemis smiled at her hesitantly, his tail twitching with his 
nervousness. &quot;It&#39;s been a long time, Luna,&quot; her said to her softly, 
trying to get her to meet his eyes.

&quot;Hello, Artemis,&quot; Luna said hesitantly, looking away from him 
slightly.

&quot;The kittens miss you,&quot; he said to her softly, even as Luna began to 
walk away.

Luna&#39;s body stiffened at that, and she hesitated. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Artemis,&quot; she finally said, her voice so low it was almost unhearable, 
&quot;but I have to go.&quot; Luna took off at a dead run, leaving Artemis 
standing there behind her.

Michiru frowned at Haruka, complaining &quot;I don&#39;t understand what&#39;s 
wrong with you today.&quot; She paced across the floor, even as Haruka 
looked out the window thoughtfully, almost seeming to be waiting for 
something.

&quot;There&#39;s nothing&#39;s wrong,&quot; Haruka said to her softly in reply, adding 
under her breath &quot;at least nothing you&#39;ve been here to notice.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s that supposed to mean?&quot; Michiru asked her indignantly.

Before Haruka could say anything, there was a soft scratching at the 
window. With a much more friendly smile than the one she had been 
giving Michiru, she quickly pushed the window open and let Luna 
inside.

&quot;Meow,&quot; Luna said happily, even as Haruka scratched her gently behind 
the ears.

Michiru watched this going on with an odd expression on her face. &quot;And 
what&#39;s with the black hair all over the bed?&quot; she complained. &quot;That 
cat spends way too much time here lately.&quot;

&quot;At least some girl is spending time with me,&quot; Haruka shot back. 
&quot;You&#39;ve been so busy with your practices that I never see you!&quot;

&quot;What? With your races you&#39;re gone as often,&quot; Michiru said weakly. She 
wasn&#39;t used to fighting with Haruka, and it shook her greatly.

Haruka looked away from her, stroking the cat gently behind the ears. 
Michiru took a few steps forward, reaching out as if to grab at Luna, 
even as Haruka shielded her. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Haruka 
demanded.

Before anything else could be said the connecting door opened and 
Setsuna strode in. &quot;We&#39;ve got a problem,&quot; she announced calmly.

&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Michiru said, glaring at Luna.

&quot;Bigger than that,&quot; Setsuna said dryly. &quot;The winter is becoming 
permanent, and we need to move quickly to stop it!&quot;

A tower rose in the far north, a tower of hard, dense ice. The snow 
dancers swirled around it, as the ice spread across the water, 
covering the sea in a shell of ice. It grew colder and colder, as the 
snow began to fall faster.

&quot;Go forth,&quot; the Snow Queen ordered her servants, &quot;It is time at last! 
The world has grown cold enough that you can complete your task, and 
seal this world away in ice!&quot;

They sang out their reply, and then swept out to the four corners of 
the globe!

Artemis shook his head, his eyes widening as he jumped to his feet. &quot;I 
remember!&quot; Artemis exclaimed, bringing the meeting to a roaring halt.

&quot;Remember what?&quot; Rei asked, pushing her short hair out of her face.

&quot;This happened once before! A Queen of snow and ice came to Earth, 
seeking to freeze it to add this world to her collection.&quot; He frowned, 
trying to remember, &quot;She was driven away by Silver Crystal power of 
hope and love!&quot;

&quot;Silver Crystal power,&quot; Ami echoed. She frowned slightly, &quot;She&#39;s 
trying to freeze the Earth, correct,&quot; she quizzed Artemis. At his nod 
of agreement she pulled out a laptop, emblazoned with her Mercury 
symbol.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Usagi said admiringly, &quot;does it have any games?&quot;

Rei sweatdropped at that, and Makoto chuckled softly. &quot;Sorry Usagi,&quot; 
Ami laughed, &quot;I set it up for official Sailor business.&quot; She worked 
intently for a moment, her expression growing grim, &quot;The North pole. 
She&#39;s up there, changing the weather patterns and expanding the ice 
caps.&quot;

&quot;So we go up there and stop her?&quot; Natsuna asked softly.

There were nods of agreement all around the group. &quot;Look at the news!&quot; 
Rei cried, pointing at the TV screen. Something was happening out in 
Tokyo Bay...

Even as they talked, the snow dancers spread the cold across the 
world. Every major city, from New York to Paris to Tokyo was visited 
by the keening figures, leaving only cold silence in their wake. Out 
in the bay, a tower of ice rises, and the queen stands atop it 
triumphant.

&quot;This world is mine at last,&quot; she sighed happily.

A snow dancer keened in alarm, &quot;World Shaking!&quot; the voice cried, and 
it exploded in a burst of energy!

The dancers began to gather to face the threat, and another voice 
cried, &quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; A tidal wave seemed to swallow the dancers up, 
leaving nothing behind.

The snow queen whirled, meeting Pluto&#39;s calm gaze. &quot;Dead Scream,&quot; she 
said quietly, and a purple bolt of death hurled towards the queen 
herself, only to be stopped by the sacrifice of one of her snow 
dancers.

&quot;So,&quot; the snow queen said quietly, &quot;the little sailors are here to 
stop me. Do you not yet understand the futility of your quest?&quot; She 
gestures to the tower, and the dancers flow out of it, ten, twenty, 
and more, marshaling in the air above them. &quot;Now, destroy them!&quot; she 
commanded.

&quot;Fire Blossom!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen cried out, casting burning roses to drive 
the first rank of snow dancers back. They flinched, afraid of the open 
flame.

&quot;Venus Love Me Chain!&quot; Sailor V cried, casting the shining chain 
across the enemy&#39;s lines.

&quot;Sparkling Wide Pressure!&quot; Sailor Jupiter growled, and threw a massive 
ball lightning to tear through several of the dancers.

&quot;Shine Aqua Illusion!&quot; Sailor Mercury cried, following up against a 
confused cluster of snow dancers, destroying them in one move.

But more and more dancers appeared, and before they could perform any 
more attacks they were struck down, singly or in pairs. Neptune saw 
Uranus go down and felt a stab of regret, a distraction she regretted 
a moment later. Mercury fell with a cry, spurring Jupiter to try and 
fight to her side, a effort doomed to failure. Finally they were all 
down, the battlefield silent.

&quot;Now, at last, it will be done,&quot; the snow queen sighed.

&quot;We&#39;re not finished yet!&quot; a voice cried out. Sailor Moon stood ready 
for battle, Natsuna and Luna at her side. &quot;Go help the others,&quot; she 
instructed her friends, before turning to the snow queen.

Luna ran across the battlefield, only to skid to a sudden stop. She 
looked at Sailor Uranus in shocked recognition, blurting out &quot;That&#39;s 
Haruka!&quot;

&quot;Another senshi?&quot; the queen barked angrily. &quot;I have had enough of 
this!&quot; She formed a ball of glowing cold power and cast it as Sailor 
Moon.

Sailor Moon raised her scepter, the words coming easily to her lips, 
&quot;Heart Ache!&quot; Her power warred with the queen&#39;s, but in the end it 
wasn&#39;t enough. The explosion blew her off her feet, ice shards 
stinging her cheeks as she leapt away.

She staggered a moment, then took her locket in hand. It opened, 
revealing a shining crystal than slid free, floating between her 
hands.

&quot;No, Usagi,&quot; Luna found herself crying, &quot;you can&#39;t use the Silver 
Crystal! You&#39;ll die!&quot;

Sailor Uranus felt herself returning to wakefulness, and found herself 
looking at the cat in deep surprise. &#39;It talked,&#39; she thought dazedly, 
&#39;the cat talked!&#39;

&quot;Alone maybe,&quot; she said, the soft light of the Crystal washing over 
her, &quot;but I&#39;m not alone!&quot; She called out to the others, &quot;Help me! 
Together, we can beat her!&quot;

Tuxedo Kamen rose to join her side first, and they shared a warm 
smile. Love seemed to leap between them, a power greater than the cold 
that was sweeping down over them. Pluto saw it, and felt her heart 
clench with jealousy.

Sailor V looked at Sailor Moon in pride. &quot;Usagi&#39;s really getting good 
at this,&quot; she smiled. She felt a gentle push at her back, and Natsuna 
gave her a confident smile.

She hefted her gun. &quot;Get this done,&quot; Natsuna said, grinning slightly, 
&quot;I&#39;ll cover you!&quot;

Sailor Mercury and Sailor Jupiter hesitated, then joined the circle. 
Finally, Uranus and Neptune stepped up, the circle closing. They all 
held hands, as shafts of light from the Crystal illuminated them all, 
linking them into something greater, somehow.

The snow queen attacked, and they countered with a shaft of pure white 
light! &quot;No,&quot; the queen gasped, &quot;it&#39;s the same light! The light that 
exiled me before!&quot;

The snow dancers charged, trying to overwhelm the sailors and destroy 
them! Natsuna fired her charmed bullets rapid fire, but suddenly one 
swept towards Sailor Uranus. Luna saw it coming, and something within 
her cried out!

And was answered. A single bolt of crystal light struck her, and Luna 
was transformed. The black-hared woman gestured, and it was like giant 
claws tore the snow beast apart! She and Natsuna demolished snow 
dancers, even as the battle came to a head!

The snow queen screamed as the beam tore through her, shattering her 
into powder! The tower of ice fell, and the beam continued onward into 
space to meet the comet itself. In moments, it was nothing but dust.

Sailor Moon cried out as the crystal flared in her hands, a wave of 
power washing over them all. As it passed, they realized they had all 
been transformed back to their civilian identities! The young women 
gazed at each other in shock, their secrets revealed.

The human Luna swayed on her feet, feeling the transformation begin to 
fade. She ran, pressing her body to Haruka&#39;s and stealing from the 
surprised woman one lingering kiss. Haruka took the dark hared woman&#39;s 
shoulders in her hands, but in a final flash of light found herself 
holding the cat in her hands. Luna frantically wiggled free, running 
away to jump into Usagi&#39;s arms.

It was a bit warmer now, as they all gathered by the water to look out 
over the bay. The unnatural cold is gone, only a more reasonable 
winter chill lingering in the air. Everyone is spaced out somewhat 
uncomfortably, the inners in one bunch, the outers in another.

Haruka and Michiru stand a little apart, talking quietly. &quot;Do you 
think they&#39;ll be all right?&quot; Usagi found herself asking Rei.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Rei said softly, &quot;they seem really happy together.&quot; She 
looked around with a frown, &quot;Where&#39;s Luna, anyway?&quot;

&quot;Back at the house,&quot; Usagi sighed. &quot;She&#39;s left Minako&#39;s place and 
taken the kittens with her,&quot; she added quietly.

&quot;Poor Artemis,&quot; Ami sighed quietly. She was snuggled into the 
protective warmth of Makoto&#39;s arm.

Setsuna sighed, watching Usagi and Rei together. She went over to 
Haruka and Michiru&#39;s side, where she simply said, &quot;Brace yourselves.&quot;

&quot;Brace ourselves?&quot; Haruka echoed.

&quot;For what?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; the voice cried, growing both louder and 
closer. Thump! Usagi and Rei found themselves sprawled out under a 
young woman who had fallen out of the sky! She scrambled off of them, 
then started to help them up.

&quot;Usagi-mama?&quot; the pink haired teen said, gazing at Usagi happily. She 
pulled the shocked girl into a hug. She peered over Usagi&#39;s shoulder, 
and her grin grow wider, &quot;Rei-papa!&quot;

Before anyone could find anything to say, it happened again! Haruka 
and Michiru were flattened by an older girl, who leapt off to offer 
them assistance quickly. Both woman instantly recognized her.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; Michiru gasped out.

She looked back and forth between them. &quot;Haruka-papa? Michiru-mama? 
What are you doing here?&quot; she asked, sounding a bit surprised.

The only one not surprised to see the two young ladies was Setsuna. 
&quot;Small Lady, Hotaru, you&#39;re just in time,&quot; she said with a little 
smile.</pre>
