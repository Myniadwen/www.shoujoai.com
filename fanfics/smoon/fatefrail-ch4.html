Under the moonlight...

Stuck Between Two Worlds

Rei had strained the last of her patience. If one more person had to ask 
her if she &quot;remembered anything&quot; she was going to scream.

Everything was so overwhelmingly unfamiliar. At least she recognized 
common objects like furniture, and things like birds and trees... She 
could even name something as complex as the IV that was stuck to her 
arm. They called it Psychogenic Amnesia. She called it an inconvenience. 
Her &quot;father&quot; did not realize all this though, and made the mistake of 
bringing flash cards to help Rei along. Deeply insulted, she nearly 
flung the offending objects back at him. Hell... She was amnesiac, not 
retarded!

She was beginning to hate her stay in the hospital. The itchy cast on 
her broken right arm, and the annoyingly perky nurses were driving her 
crazy. She would rather brave the unknown than stay another minute 
surrounded by these patronizing idiots. If she weren&#39;t drugged with 
medicine most of the time, she would walk out the door herself. And what 
was up with all the medication anyway? She knew for certain that 
head-trauma was not terminal... least of all hers.

While Rei was stewing over these thoughts in her bed, Dr. Mizuno smiled 
slightly beside her. The truth was, her patient was already well enough 
to be discharged from the hospital. But her overprotective father had 
insisted that his daughter stay in the hospital for a few more days in 
case the doctors missed something.

Kaori knew he meant well and was worried about the young girl&#39;s current 
state of memory loss... but he really was overreacting too much. &quot;Do you 
feel any pain, Rei-chan? Migraines?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; Rei answered, sounding almost petulant. &quot;I&#39;m &#39;perfectly&#39; fine.&quot; 
The doctor nodded neutrally and scribbled something on her clipboard. 
&quot;Mizuno-sensei...&quot; The young girl began seriously, &quot;I want to leave.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that&#39;s up to your father,&quot; Kaori told her. &quot;But don&#39;t worry; 
you&#39;ll be able to leave soon.&quot; She nodded to the other girl before she 
walked out of the room.

Rei watched her leave with a frown. &#39;Cold woman...&#39; She thought before 
shifting around in her bed uncomfortably. She wished she had television 
in the room... or even a radio. But she had none of those because &quot;that 
stupid man&quot; deemed that it was too much for her poor, damaged brain to 
handle. She wondered if the patriarchal man had always been like that... 
He was so irrational.

She looked out of the window and jerked in surprise. She had seen 
something, or rather someone-- a flash of long, blonde hair. &#39;What 
the...?&#39; But she knew that her room was three stories high. She 
struggled out of bed, and dragged the IV with her towards the window. 
Something was compelling her to check. Curiosity? A certainty that she 
really had seen someone and simply wanted to confirm it with her own 
eyes?

When she looked outside, she saw nothing unusual. Of course! What else 
did she expect?

She was about to turn away, and return to her bed, when she saw it 
again. She followed the figure with astonished eyes as a blonde-haired 
girl, with strange-looking pigtails who wore a peculiar sailor uniform, 
ran down the road away from the hospital building. What was bizarre 
about this otherwise normal sight was the fact that this girl was nearly 
transparent and that her movements were caught in slow motion.

&#39;Rabbit...&#39; The thought came unbidden in her mind. She blinked and shook 
her head. Then checked to see if the apparition was still there. 
Nothing. It was gone. &#39;I must&#39;ve hit my head harder than I thought... 
I&#39;m having hallucinations.&#39; She shook her head again-- troubled with 
this weird, new development.

Friday... Her father finally relented to have her discharged from the 
hospital on Friday. Well... today was that day and no one showed up. For 
some odd reason, Rei felt that this sort of thing was familiar. She felt 
uncomfortable waiting alone in the Hospital lobby and regretted chasing 
away the fussy nurse that was assigned to watch her. The people that 
would pass through the doors, especially the sick ones, were making her 
feel very ill.

One case stood out of the rest... One child was wheeled in. She seemed 
to be locked in some kind of happy trance. The small girl looked at her 
with an open-mouthed smile, saliva dripping down one corner of her lip. 
She overheard the doctors call it the &quot;Gaudium Syndrome.&quot; She had 
quickly looked away, completely unnerved by the happy emptiness in the 
child&#39;s eyes.

After waiting for almost an hour, the dark-haired girl had finally had 
it and stood up. She could not take being inside this clinical prison 
for another minute. A yellow convertible, a Mazda Miata, pulled up 
alongside the curb just when Rei walked outside. &quot;Hey lady, want a 
ride?&quot; The sandy blonde-haired driver called out cheekily, dark green 
eyes twinkling.

Rei paused and stared at the driver for a while, a rather good-looking 
man at that, suspicious and intrigued at the same time. &quot;Do I know you?&quot;

&quot;I work for your father.&quot; When he stepped out of the car, Rei was amazed 
to realize that he was actually a &#39;she.&#39; Sure she was tall, had 
boyish-cut hair, and was wearing mannish khaki slacks with a loose, 
white button-down shirt... But the roundness of her breasts that hinted 
below her shirt was obvious to those who looked. &quot;I&#39;m Ten&#39;ou Haruka. 
Your father called me a few minutes ago to pick you up.&quot;

&quot;A few minutes ago? I was waiting for almost an hour!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; The amiable smile on the handsome woman&#39;s face fell, and was 
replaced by a contrite one. &quot;Your father was probably held up in an 
extremely important meeting and just recently managed to get out of it 
to call me to pick you up.&quot; Rei could not help but feel that the words 
seemed like a white lie. No... She KNEW it was a white lie.

She let out an aggrieved sigh before walking around the car and got in. 
Haruka got in as well and drove out of the Hospital and onto the main 
road. The blonde could not help but glance at Rei at the corner of her 
eye. She was sure Yasujiro had told her that his daughter had amnesia... 
But Rei was acting like Rei, who did not seem surprised by Haruka&#39;s 
convincing excuses-- as if she had heard them before. She knew that the 
young girl was extremely perceptive before the accident but this was 
just a little eerie.

&quot;Do you remember anything, Rei-dono?&quot; Haruka ventured out, testing the 
waters.

&quot;If you ask me that question one more time... I&#39;m going to stick my foot 
in your mouth...&quot; Rei whispered dangerously, not even looking in the 
blonde&#39;s direction when she said that.

Haruka smirked. Rei was Rei... Amnesiac or not. &quot;Sorry, I just had to 
ask.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;Well... You&#39;re acting like your normally peachy self; I thought your 
father was lying when he said you had amnesia.&quot;

That finally brought a smile to Rei&#39;s face, albeit a self-deprecating 
one. &quot;I was always that grumpy?&quot;

&quot;Only on your better days.&quot; Haruka joked while she turned the car to the 
left at a less busy intersection and skillfully maneuvered them around 
the other stagnant cars. &quot;Would you like something to eat before you 
meet up with your father? I bet you hardly even ate that 
cardboard-flavored junk they serve in the hospital. I know I wouldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Yeah... I&#39;d like that.&quot; The dark-haired answered gratefully.

She never took her eyes away from the scenery that flashed in front of 
her as the car sped ahead. She felt like a tourist as she admired the 
unfamiliar and beautiful shops and restaurants that lined the streets. 
She admired the goods that she would catch glimpses of, within these 
buildings. She inwardly vowed to re-acquaint herself to this wonderful 
place... if her father did not decide to lock her in some house for her 
own safety. She rolled her eyes at that probability.

The car slowed down to a stop in front of a restaurant called Anna 
Miller. &quot;We used to always eat here together. So don&#39;t be surprised if 
some of the waitresses recognize us.&quot; Haruka told her, a strange-- 
almost impish grin on her face, as she held the door for her younger 
charge. Rei was looking at her oddly as she walked inside, so she did 
not see some of the available waitresses suddenly perk up and moved 
towards them.

&quot;Good afternoon!&quot; They greeted brightly, startling Rei. The dark-haired 
girl&#39;s eyes widened when she finally took in their appearances-- 
especially the exaggerated emphasis on their breasts and legs by the cut 
of their rather short uniforms. The ribbon above the butt... It was just 
so, so huge! &#39;Oh my god...&#39; She thought.

&quot;Haruka-chan! Rei-sama!&quot; A short and cute red-haired waitress suddenly 
launched herself towards Rei and wrapped her arms around her neck, 
careful to not jar the cast between their bodies. &quot;Rei-sama! I was so 
worried! I thought that I would never see you again!&quot; She pulled away, 
their faces inches from each other, to pout at the older girl. &quot;You made 
Naru-chan cry. Boo...!&quot;

&#39;Wha--!&#39; Rei was dumbstruck, flinching away from the other girl&#39;s 
nearness-- which was hard to do since she was wrapped around her like an 
octopus.

&quot;Whoah there, Osaka-chan! Rei-dono just got out of the hospital.&quot; Haruka 
laughed, stepping behind the red-head named Osaka Naru, and pried her 
away from the other girl. Naru immediately latched on to Haruka, 
blushing like a happy bride in her arms.

&quot;Haruka-chan! You&#39;re so mean! You haven&#39;t visited us for a while! 
Naru-chan missed you!&quot;

&quot;You did? But why would such a pretty girl like you miss someone like 
me? Don&#39;t you have dashing suitors pounding away at your doorstep 
everyday?&quot; The blonde was practically oozing with charm as she smiled 
down at the smaller girl flirtatiously.

Rei shook her head at this public display of affection and went ahead to 
look for an available table. A few minutes later, Haruka joined her and 
sat across from her. She had a sheepish expression on her face when she 
met Rei&#39;s arched eyebrow.

Naru appeared beside them and put a couple of menus in front of them. 
Then she whipped out her little notepad and pen, and finally put on a 
professionally cute air that was Anna Miller&#39;s trademark. &quot;What would 
you like to order?&quot;

Haruka did not touch her menu, knowing what to order already. She waited 
patiently as Rei perused hers. &quot;Uh... I&#39;d like the club sandwich and 
some iced tea please.&quot; The dark-haired girl told her.

&quot;Same here.&quot; Haruka added.

Naru jotted the orders down in her notepad. &quot;Is that all?&quot; She saw her 
customers nod. &quot;Thank you. The food will be served in a few minutes.&quot; 
The red-head bounced away, but not before winking at Haruka.

The table was silent for a moment. Rei could not help but stare at the 
waitresses that passed by. &#39;Such tight shirts...&#39; She thought. &#39;How can 
they breathe in that thing?&#39; She turned around to see her companion 
looking back at her intently. She was annoyed to feel embarrassed to be 
caught staring like a hormonal pubescent boy and looked around again, 
this time, nonchalantly observing the kind of people who ate here.

Otaku...

They were everywhere. What kind of place was this! &quot;THIS is where we eat 
most of the time?&quot; Rei asked incredulously.

&quot;ALL the time actually.&quot; Haruka answered, stifling a chuckle. She was 
extremely amused at how fidgety Rei seemed, especially when she looked 
like she was trying hard not to look at the suggestively-uniformed 
girls. &quot;You can look all you want, you know? The waitresses here are 
used to it. Touching them is a big no-no though.&quot; She grinned when the 
other girl flashed her a glare.

&quot;Are you sure? Because one of them was willing enough to be touched by 
you.&quot; Rei retorted sarcastically. The blonde blushed at this.

&quot;Yeah... I get that a lot.&quot;

&quot;I bet...&quot; The younger girl muttered under her breath. Out loud, she 
said, &quot;Does &#39;Naru-chan&#39; know you&#39;re a girl?&quot; Haruka nodded. &quot;Why do you 
dress like that?&quot;

The blonde looked mildly offended at that. &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not exactly the 
latest thing to hit the stores but it&#39;s comfortable.&quot;

&quot;No, I mean-- forget it...&quot; And Rei had accused Haruka of putting her 
foot in her mouth earlier. She was no different. Feeling like a fool, 
she refused to meet the other&#39;s eyes.

&#39;Jeez... Defensive much?&#39; Haruka thought, chagrined. She kept forgetting 
that Rei was like a newborn--everything was new to her. &quot;Look Rei-dono,&quot; 
she began, &quot;it&#39;s really quite simple. I am a boy trapped in a girl&#39;s 
body.&quot; She had said the words humorously, but she was alarmed to see the 
blood drain from Rei&#39;s face.

&quot;So um...&quot; The younger girl started, and Haruka was afraid that she was 
going to ask her the dreaded question. &quot;You said we ate here together a 
lot. Are... Are we together?&quot;

At first, the blonde was confused with the question. She had not been 
expecting that one. Then she realized what exactly it was that Rei had 
asked and doubled over in laughter. &quot;Kami... NO! Your father is going to 
kill me if we were! What made you think we were a couple anyway?&quot;

By now, Rei was wishing really hard that the ground would rise up and 
swallow her whole. She had never felt so mortified-- by her own audacity 
and foolishness to ask such a ridiculous question. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she mumbled, 
&quot;I&#39;m just grasping at straws here... I was just trying to find out what 
kind of person I am and what kind of life I was supposed to lead...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to rush, Rei-dono.&quot; Haruka offered sympathetically. 
&quot;You&#39;ll learn more about yourself, little by little, in due time.&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

There was a short and uncomfortable pause which Naru interrupted when 
she came back. &quot;Here are your orders!&quot; She announced cheerfully and 
arranged the food and drinks in front of the pair. She turned to Rei and 
sweetly spoke to her before she left them again, &quot;It&#39;s great seeing you 
again, Rei-sama.&quot;

Rei, fearing the worst, pointed at the retreating girl&#39;s back and 
queried, &quot;Are we...?&quot;

&quot;Hell no.&quot; Haruka chuckled. &quot;She&#39;s not your type.&quot;

The assembly hall of TA Gakuen bustling with students. There were a lot 
of excited whispers. There was a rumor going around that their idol was 
back and that she would be addressing everyone today. Of course, it was 
just a rumor with the prospect that it couldn&#39;t be true. Of course, as 
rumors went-- 50 of them were true.

Hino Rei was returning to school-- just not today. And it was the 
headmaster who had everyone gathered in hall to address the issue 
regarding the girl, himself.

&quot;Good morning, everyone.&quot; He spoke, his nasal voice resonating in the 
loudspeakers. &quot;As you all know, on the unfortunate night, a week and a 
half ago, one of our dear students was involved in a car accident. She 
lay unconscious, but recovering, in the hospital for two days. Well... 
She will be returning next week.

&quot;Yes, you heard me clearly. Statesman Hino&#39;s daughter will be coming 
back to school on Monday. Now, the reason why I gathered you here today 
was to tell you that I expect each and every one of you to treat Hino 
Rei-san with sensitivity and tact. I have been told that she has amnesia 
due to her head-trauma. Bearing these things in mind... You should treat 
her accordingly.

&quot;Now... Are there any questions?&quot;

The hall erupted with raised hands and voices.

&quot;He... WHAT!&quot; Monday morning, her &#39;first&#39; day of school... and she was 
already wishing she had not left the hospital. &#39;Of all the infuriating 
things...&#39; Rei stormed into her father&#39;s study, Haruka hurriedly rushing 
after her and trying to intervene.

&quot;I&#39;m sure your father meant well...&quot; The blonde began only to be cut 
off.

&quot;Are you trying to run a freak show... &#39;Dad?&#39;&quot; Rei demanded angrily, 
approaching her oddly calm father sitting behind a large, red Mahogany 
desk. &quot;Am I the main attraction?&quot;

&quot;Of course not, Rei-chan.&quot; Yasujiro answered serenely.

&quot;Then WHY did you call my school and asked the staff to tell EVERYBODY 
that I&#39;m brain-damaged!&quot; Rei started pacing, too furious to stay in one 
place. She was so tempted to hit her father over the head with her cast. 
What had he been thinking!

&quot;Alright, first of all you&#39;re not brain-damaged.&quot; The older man looked 
upset with that and was trying to use the most soothing voice he had 
possible. &quot;And I was only trying to make sure your classmates won&#39;t hurt 
you or take advantage of your... condition.&quot;

&quot;Did you ever stop to think that I can handle myself? GOD! What am I? 
Incompetent? Helpless? I don&#39;t need everyone in school to recognize that 
I&#39;m the retarded one they had heard about and start pointing fingers at 
me!&quot;

&quot;Stop saying those things about yourself! You&#39;re not like that!&quot;

&quot;Did you tell YOURSELF that!&quot;

Haruka had buried her face in her hand. What a mess... She should&#39;ve 
just kept her big mouth shut when Rei had voiced her concerns over her 
re-integration to a school life that she could not remember. She could 
not look at the arguing father and daughter. But she could feel 
Yasujiro&#39;s accusing eyes boring holes into her head.

Finally the blonde pulled her hand away and yelled to be heard over the 
shouting match. &quot;You&#39;re going to be late for school, Rei-dono!&quot;

&quot;Fine!&quot; Rei spat back and stomped out of the room.

Haruka turned to her boss. &quot;Sir... I&#39;ll be driving Rei-dono to school 
now.&quot;

&quot;Fine!&quot; Yasujiro snapped before rolling the chair to face the window, 
hiding his tense form from view.

Without another word, the blonde left the room quickly.

Rei ignored her for the rest of the drive. When they finally arrived in 
TA Gakuen, she jumped out of the car before the blonde could speak or 
apologize. When she walked through TA&#39;s grand and intricately designed 
entrance gates, she was instantly surrounded by school girls talking all 
at once.

&quot;Rei-sama! Welcome back!&quot;

&quot;Rei-sama, how are you?&quot;

&quot;If you need any help, Rei-sama, just ask me!&quot;

&quot;Rei-sama!&quot;

&quot;Rei-sama!&quot;

The dark-haired tried to shield her broken arm from their enthusiastic 
expression of female adoration and tried to push through the crowd with 
little success. Finally, her already frayed patience spent, she 
screamed, &quot;BACK OFF!&quot;

Just as the nearby girls instinctively stepped back in surprise at her 
vehemence, Rei felt herself being scooped up in protective arms and was 
quickly carried through the mass and into the main building&#39;s entrance 
where Haruka finally let her down.

&quot;Thanks...&quot; Rei looked up at the taller woman with awe and gratitude.

&quot;No need.&quot; The blonde answered, smiling sheepishly. &quot;I was just making 
it up to you for not stopping your father&#39;s foolhardy idea.&quot;

Rei thwacked her shoulder harmlessly for that one. &quot;Yeah... Whatever... 
Get out of here.&quot;

&quot;Sure thing, princess.&quot; The other woman winked. &quot;I&#39;ll be picking you up 
later. And I might probably do that literally if the afternoon is 
anything like this morning. Until then... Gambatte, Rei-dono!&quot;

Rei nodded, took a deep breath to gather her courage, and entered the 
building like she was approaching the gallows. Haruka mentally wished 
her luck one more time before turning around to walk in the opposite 
direction.

As a doctor, Mizuno Kaori knew she must keep a certain professional 
distance from her patients. But treating patients with the Gaudium 
Syndrome was making it hard for her to keep detached. In fact she was 
close to feeling more than a little worried and anxious.

She watched the patients through the glass window of the ICU. The ward 
was full to capacity with people with Gaudium Syndrome and more were 
coming everyday. As far as the research department knew, there was no 
cure for this weird psychological illness. Was there an epidemic? Was 
this simply mass hysteria? But what could cause such a thing?

She turned her attention to a child, the latest one who was brought in.

A Jane Doe-- most likely a street urchin judging by the rags that she 
wore-- was found standing, catatonic, in the middle of the road-- the 
cars speeding and blaring their horns past her until a concerned 
bystander was finally smart enough to realize that something was wrong 
with this little girl.

So far, out of everyone with the illness, she was the most responsive. 
The research department, whom Kaori was actually a part of, wanted to 
bring her to their private facilities to perform tests on her. Kaori 
shook her head in pity at the little girl&#39;s impending fate. A lab rat, 
she was going to be... But she was no one... A street kid was not going 
to be missed.

She turned away from the window and left. She did not notice a small 
figure appear beside the Jane Doe&#39;s bed.

The little girl turned towards the newcomer, smiling happily. If only 
Kaori had stuck around, she would&#39;ve witnessed a miracle. The child 
spoke. &quot;Deedee-onee-chan.&quot;

&quot;Hello Dumdum-onee-chan.&quot; The mirror image of the girl, this one who had 
inky-black hair instead of platinum-blonde like the other, spoke. &quot;Did 
you have a nice tour?&quot;

&quot;Yes, onee-chan. The people in this world were very nice to me.&quot;

The other twin slapped her hard. &quot;Idiot! They are all faking it! This 
world is as crummy as the last!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry onee-chan.&quot; Dumdum sat up and pressed a hand gingerly on her 
cheek. But she felt nothing. Things like sensations and feelings were 
eradicated from her system a long time ago. There was only happiness. 
Pure, unadulterated, ignorant bliss...

Deedee reached out to tear the IV from her sister&#39;s arm. The sisters 
watched the blood spurt out for a moment, before Deedee bent down to 
lick along her arm-- following the bloody trail until she reached the 
wound where she began to suck on it.

Dumdum smiled happily.

Finally, when the wound stopped bleeding, Deedee straightened and pulled 
her sister down. &quot;Come on... The queen is waiting for us.&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Dumdum agreed with quiet joviality before they both disappeared, 
unnoticed, in thin air.

+Author&#39;s Note+

Is it just me or are the chapters getting shorter and shorter. O.o;;;

Hehe... I&#39;m sick right now so the next update might take a little 
longer. I typed this baby as best as I can in my state! But I am about 
ready to collapse. Damn, I&#39;m obsessed...

The reference to Anna Miller is true in real life. My mom told me about 
it and about the waitresses there. I am so envious she got to see them! 
T.T If I was there, I might&#39;ve probably joined the Otakus in the ranks. 
Lol. Naw...

The &quot;-dono&quot; suffix means you are regarding someone with respect. I 
believe it translates to madam or sir.

You probably all know what otaku means already (because I know anyone 
reading this fanfic is a pure-blooded BSSM otaku) so I&#39;m not explaining 
that one.

Gambatte means &#39;hang in there&#39; or &#39;good luck.&#39;

Anyone noticed any fairytale allusions yet? Anyone :P Like I said... The 
theme may seem unoriginal but the plot isn&#39;t.</pre>
