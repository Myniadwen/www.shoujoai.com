<h1>Setsuna Gets a Surprise</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/valie.html">Valie</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Setsuna looked around nervously. Haruka was out for the day and Hotaru 
was in her room playing with Chibiusa. This left her and Michiru alone 
for most of the day. There was absolutely nothing to do. All the 
housework had been done and Michiru didn&#39;t feel like painting. And 
Setsuna didn&#39;t want to sew or do pretty much anything. However, as she 
sat watching the tv, she couldn&#39;t help but feel the hungry eyes of the 
water nymph gaze at her from time to time. Nervously, she excused 
herself from the room and decided to head for the bathroom. She hoped 
that her imagination was playing tricks with her mind. She let the hot 
water run and undressed as it slowly rose up. She stopped it halfway 
and carefully slipped in. The heat engulfed her body in warmth. Her 
eyes fluttered as she tried to fight the feeling of sleep that washed 
over her. 

While this happened, Michiru checked on Hotaru and Chibiusa. To her 
surprise and delight, the two girls were sleeping peacefully. She 
smiled at the sight and covered them with a blanket. She placed a soft 
kiss on both their foreheads before quietly exiting the room and 
headed towards the bathroom. She was fully aware of the fact that 
Setsuna was in there. She quietly peeked in and saw that Setsuna was 
on the verge of falling a sleep. She entered the bathroom and locked 
the door behind her.

At the sound of the click, Setsuna stirred a bit and looked up in time 
to see Michiru smiling at her. &quot;What...?,&quot; was all that Setsuna could 
say before Michiru placed a finger on her lips. The soft finger was 
removed and replaced with Michiru&#39;s soft lips. Setsuna wanted to pull 
away but the feeling that formed within her wouldn&#39;t let her move. She 
felt a bit helpless at the moment and she just closed her eyes. When 
Michiru finally pulled away, Setsuna&#39;s face was a bit flushed. She 
stared up at the sparkling blue eyes of the woman she had known for so 
long. She didn&#39;t know what would happen next. 

As if Michiru had read her mind, she removed the blue skirt and let it 
drop to the floor. Setsuna&#39;s eyes widen as she realized what Michiru&#39;s 
intentions were. The silk white shirt Michru wore, also fell to the 
floor and Setsuna was a bit surprised to see that she wore no bra. 
Setsuna could only blush at the sight of the beautiful woman in front 
of her. Their eyes met and Michiru held out a hand to Setsuna, who 
grabbed it and was pulled to her feet. Michiru&#39;s lips found the other 
woman&#39;s lips once again and this time she didn&#39;t hold back from the 
kiss. Thier tongues mingled and explored each other&#39;s mouths. Michiru 
pulled Setsuna closer to her, letting the water drip where it may. 

Michiru&#39;s hands moved along the slender body of her roommate, 
discovering small weaknesses as she went. The seconds ticked slowly as 
the two were soon on the bathroom floor. Michiru taking the upperhand 
and showing Setsuna how a woman should be pleasured. Her tongue 
licking every inch of the tan breasts and her hands carassing tan 
thighs. Setsuna could feel her sex heating up and almost begging to be 
touched by the soft hands of the violinist. Michiru teased Setsuna by 
slowly leaving small kisses down her stomach and licking Setsuna&#39;s 
slit once and than pausing for a moment to hear soft pleas of wanting 
more. She smiled as Setsuna squirmed a bit before she finally let 
Setsuna have the release she so desparately wanted. Michiru&#39;s tongue 
played about in the almost virgin sex of her friend. She sucked on her 
clit before plunging her tongue within the senshi of time. Setsuna&#39;s 
mind filled with a long since forgotten emotion, one of lust and 
desire. Her moans echoed through the room getting louder each time 
Michiru&#39;s tongue went deeper. Finally Setsuna could take no more and 
came. Michiru was quick to lick up as much as she wanted. When she 
finished they kissed again. Setsuna smiled weakly at Michiru when they 
pulled away. Nothing could&#39;ve interrupted the moment, nothing but the 
knock that came from door. Both froze, fearing it was Haruka but a 
small voice eased them.

&quot;Setsuna-mama? Are you in there?,&quot; a sleepy Hotaru asked.

&quot;Yes dear. I&#39;ll be out in a minute,&quot; Setsuna said standing up.

Michiru and Setsuna quickly slipped on their robes before opening the 
door. Hotaru was surprised to see that Michiru was in the bathroom 
with Setsuna. 

&quot;What happened?,&quot; Setsuna asked.

&quot;I thought I heard you in pain so I came to check on you,&quot; the 
innocent little girl said.

&quot;Um... She hit her head when she went to turn off the shower and I 
came to make sure she was okay. Right, Setsuna?,&quot; Michiru quickly 
said.

&quot;Hai! But don&#39;t worry Hotaru, I&#39;ll be fine. It just hurted a lot when 
I first hit my head.&quot;

&quot;Okay. Well, I&#39;m still sleepy... so I&#39;m going back... to bed,&quot; Hotaru 
yawned.

&quot;Okay, sweetheart.&quot;

Michiru and Setsuna both kissed the little girl and watched her go 
back to her room. When the door locked they both let out a sigh of 
relief. At the same time they heard Haruka pull up to the house. The 
two women scrambled to their rooms, stopping to kiss each other one 
last time. Setsuna flopped down on her bed and stared up at the 
ceiling. She never thought that something like this would ever happen. 
But now that it had, she liked it. Her eyes fluttered once again as 
she felt sleep wash over her. She managed to cover up and relax a bit. 
Just before she fell asleep, her last thought was of Michiru. &quot;Next 
time it&#39;ll be her turn,&quot; she mumbled before finally falling asleep 
with a smile on her face.

I hoped you enjoyed my little fic. I love this couple, but I&#39;ve really 
never read anything about these two together. So I took it into my own 
hands to write this  fic. Expect more Michiru/ Setsuna fics from me in 
the future. Flames, questions, reviews, and whatever else are 
welcomed. Ja ne! ^__^ </pre>
