<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 11 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The song is called &#39;One Night a Day&#39; by Garth Brooks. I don&#39;t own the 
song nor Sailor Moon.

At that moment, Yung Hu&#39;s hand rose up, a green flickering light in his 
hand. It looked like a sort of green fire ball. He roared out in both 
anger and pain when he shot it out at Rubeus. Rubeus, who was still 
looking at Sailor Moon had no time to react so he had been hit head on 
with the fire ball, causing him to fly into a wall and hit it with a 
sickening crack. Yung Hu&#39;s hand then fell to the ground.

He was dead.

A roar of voices yelled out in anguish at the sight of the falling 
warrior. But none were as loud as Sailor Jupiter&#39;s voice. She was 
trembling so hard, Sailor Moon swore the crystal cross that held her was 
cracking in places.

&quot;That stupid animal,&quot; Rubeus said as he stood from the floor to his feet 
wobbling feet. &quot;I&#39;m happy he&#39;s gon-What the hell!?&quot; His attention was 
now turned to Sailor Jupiter as well, who was straining agaisnt her 
crystal prison. The pure white crystal began to turn red from the inside 
out from the wounds that poured out blood that were caused by sharp cuts 
to Jupiter&#39;s body.

Sailor Jupiter&#39;s head was bowed as she screamed out in agony. Tears 
coursed down her face as her back near her shoulder blades began to 
twitch. Soon, white feathered wings erupted from her back, although they 
were no longer beautiful. Feathers began fall from her wings like snow, 
her wings now taking on a leathery look.

Something shot out from behind the crystal; a tail. A green tail was now 
twitching behind Jupiter&#39;s cross and it took no genious to figure out it 
had erupted from Jupiter&#39;s back as well.

Sailor Jupiter&#39;s cross snapped in half and she fell forward the five 
feet to the ground. Her hands were still incased in the crstal so her 
face smashed headlong into the ground and those closest to her would 
have sworn the cracking noise was her nose and not the floor.

Her wings pushed back on the cross and it flew into the back wall, 
narrowling missing Venus as it flew by. Jupiter flew her head back, stil 
cryin out in rage, blood flowing from her face in several places. Horns 
were begining to grow from her forhead, causing her tiara to snap in 
half. The horns grew quickly and began to turn, shaping themselves into 
what resembled ram&#39;s horns. Her neck also grew, lengthening several feet 
into an almost serpentine way.

Her skin began to turn scaley and green as her face lengthen and 
hundreds of sharp teeth formed inside of her mouth.

Her fuku ripped as her body began to grow too large for it. it fell to 
peices and landed silently next to her. Her hands and feet were large 
finger and toe nails that looked razor sharp.

Jupiter stood from her place on the floor. Seconds after she had stood, 
two large snaps were heard s her knees bent backward, and her feet grew 
to acomidate her knew leg formation.

After minutes of screaming in pain from the transformation of her new 
body, Sailor Jupiter fell to the ground panting heavily. Sailor Moon 
took several steps back.

Rubeus, looked at the fallen girl. &quot;What the-&quot; he was cut off once again 
by another large roar. Except this time it wasn&#39;t a roar of sadness. It 
was one of rage.

Jupiter, now in her new form, quickly jumped from the floor, her frame 
now at least twelve feet tall, her wings twenty feet from tip to tip. 
Her tail swished behind her as her eyes narrowed dangerously at Rubeus.

She charged the negitave barrior and broke thru. But after she was thru 
it, she hunched over breathing heavily again. Rubeus laughed.

&quot;You can hardly go thru a simple negitave wall, what makes you think you 
can take me?&quot;

Jupiter slowly raised her head, her eyes now a blood red. Her head 
slowly turned to the pulsating purple crystal that was with in her 
reach. She reached out a taloned hand before looking back towards 
Rubeus.

He shook his head at her, fear clearly written on his face. Growling 
deep into her throat, Jupiter&#39;s hand slowly closed in on the crystal. It 
exploded in her had and fell to the floor in a pile of dust.

Rubeus fell to his knees, clutching his head as he screamed in pain. 
Jupiter lumbered towards him, her every step shaking the space ship. 
Rubeus looked up at her. He quickly got to his feet and scrambled for 
the dagger laying several feet from him. He felt his fingers clutc 
around it and he turned towards the transformed senshi of lightening and 
lunged at her.

Jupiter quickly turned her body and slapped the dagger from his hand 
with her tail. The dagger flew into the air and embeded itself in a 
wall. When Rubeus turned to face Jupiter, he felt her scaly hand circle 
around his throat. He tried to punch her, but her body mass nearly broke 
his hand.

She placed her other hand on his shoulder, and the other hand moved to 
the opposite side of his head. In a swift motion, Jupiter criss crossed 
her arms and not only snapped Rubeus&#39;s head, but tore it clean from his 
body.

Jupiter then turned to the others who were now standing around Yung Hu&#39;s 
lifeless body. They had been set free when she had destroyed the 
crystal. She stared at them for a moment, and the group looked back. 
Blinking, Jupiter&#39;s eyes flickered to a brighter red, and she roared 
again and as she turned to charge the group, the ship began to shake 
violently and start to crummble. Fires began to erupt in several places, 
one said fire was encasing them with a now very dangerous Jupiter.

As the ship began to crumble, a large piece of the ship fell and hit 
Jupiter&#39;s head, causing her to stagger and to fall uncounscious.

As the ship continued to crummble, Sailor Moon turned to the others. &quot;We 
need to get out of here!&quot;

&quot;How,&quot; asked Chibi Usa who was still clutching Yung Hu&#39;s corpse.

&quot;We can use teleportation,&quot; suggested Mercury.

&quot;But will it work,&quot; Mars asked. &quot;There are only four f us who can 
teleport and we have six extra people to take with us,too.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got to try,&quot; Mercury said urgently. &quot;If we don&#39;t we&#39;ll surely die 
here.&quot; The senshi turned and looked at one another, nodded and formed a 
circle around Yung hu, Chibi Usa, and Jupiter. They asked the guardians 
to move iside the chain as well, but the shook their heads and stepped 
out of the ring.

They formed a ring of their own, the tips of their wings filling in the 
gaps. They bowed their heads and clasped their hands together as if they 
were praying, and began muttering a language no one understood. A bright 
flash of lights engulfed the entire group, and in mere seconds they were 
gone.

The group was transported to an old abandoned warehouse. The senshi 
looked around then to the guardians.

&quot;Why are we here,&quot; Sailor Moon asked.

Raiga took hold of Jupiter&#39;s body and dragged her over to a wall that 
had chains bolted to it. He took four of the chains and clasped one 
around her ankles and wrists. The last one that was fitted with 
something that resembled a collar, he snapped around her neck.

&quot;We&#39;re here because of Makoto&#39;s transformation,&quot; Raiga said.

Venus stared at him. &quot;You knew about this?&quot;

Raiga nodded. &quot;Hai, I did.&quot;

The senshi stared at him. Venus was shaking with anger.

&quot;You fucking KNEW!? You knew and you didn&#39;t TELL us!?&quot; She was begining 
to cry now. &quot;Why the hell not?!&quot;

&quot;Yung Hu told us just yesterday,&quot; Karasu said, coming to his comrade&#39;s 
defense. &quot;And even if we had known sooner, we still couldn&#39;t have told 
you. He made us swore not to tell anyone.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean &#39;he made us swore not to tell anyone,&quot; Mars asked. &quot;He 
knew?&quot;

&quot;Of course he did,&quot; Tori said, tears brimming her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m so confused,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;I demand you to explain this.&quot;

Tori looked at the blonde in disgust. &quot;You are not our leader,&quot; she 
snapped. &quot;We do not follow your orders.&quot;

&quot;You will follow my demands,&quot; Sailor Moon said calmly, but sternly. &quot;You 
protect my daughter, there fore I was the one who put you in charge. 
Explain, now.&quot;

Tori growled, but Raigi cut her off from making any snide remarks.

&quot;Yung Hu is from the future, just like us. But he was born at least a 
hundred years before the rest of us. How old do you think the princess 
is?&quot; All eyes fell upon the small child who was still cradeling Yung 
Hu&#39;s head in her lap.

&quot;Six,&quot; Mercury said.

Raiga shook his head. &quot;Iie. She&#39;s over nine-hundred years old. She and 
Yung Hu are older than Tori, Karasu, and myself. Yung Hu was born here, 
in this time. You must understand that our kind can out live those from 
the Royal Moon family. But no one know&#39;s why. As far as we know, our 
race is nearly immortal, unless we fight. We do not die of old age nor 
disease.

&quot;Yung Hu, like I said, was born in this time. And he lived long enough 
to see Chibi Usa born and then to meet us as well. Then he was sent back 
into time becuase something happened to Makoto. Her parents were not 
suppossed to die. Not both of them. And for some un known reason, they 
did. So Yung Hu traveled back thru time to be with her, although he 
could not reveal himself to her just then. He changed his appearnce so 
he would be a kitten instead of an adult cat. Kittens can be easily 
befriended than adults. he simply made himself &#39;grow up&#39; by changing his 
size every few years.&quot;

&quot;So thats how he knew everything,&quot; Mercury said out loud. &quot;By being born 
in the past and living thru the future than dying in the past, he was 
able to learn about his own death. Is that about right?&quot;

Raiga nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;So, he knew about Makoto chaning into this...&quot;Mercury looked over at 
the still uncounsious Makoto, still transformed.

&quot;Hai he did. Remember when Makoto was killed and a mystery man fused 
their bodies together so she could continue to live? Yung Hu did that in 
his human form. Only after that did he reveal himself to her as to what 
he truely was. But never his human form. He wasn&#39;t sure if she would 
understand. But as to this form..&quot; Raiga turned to Venus. &quot;Had Makoto 
been complaing about headaches lately?&quot;

Venus nodded. &quot;Hai, but I was so worried about it I asked Rei to do a 
fire reading for me.&quot;

Mars groaned. &quot;Gomen ne, Mina-chan. I totaly forgot when you showed up 
at the temple..&quot; Venus nodded.

&quot;She&#39;s been fighting with the demon&#39;s soul since they were fused. And it 
is a demon. Youma&#39;s do not try to eat their prey after attacking them. 
They simply want their life essence. Thats why she&#39;s been having 
headaches. She been having inner battles that she wasn&#39;t aware that were 
going on. But when she saw Yung Hu killed, she let the demon have 
control. And it transformed her into her spirtual form.&quot;

&quot;...A dragon,&quot; Venus said. &quot;Will she change back?&quot;

Raiga sighed. &quot;She will. But we don&#39;t know when or how. Yung Hu refused 
to tell us. Thats why we broguht her here. Everything here has been 
enchanted so she can&#39;t be heard nor seen. And there is also a charm on 
the building to ward off anyone but us.

&quot;We&#39;ll need to take turns guarding over her,&quot; Raiga continued. &quot;Just in 
case she was able to escape.&quot;

&quot;Tori and I have decided to take first watch,&quot; Karasu said. &quot;I&#39;ll take 
tonight&#39;s watch, and Tori will take over tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll need to take both day and night shifts. Or at least come in to 
check on her,&quot; Raiga said. &quot;We guardians will take day shifts and part 
of night shifts because you are still in school. But after studying, I 
ask you get here as soon as possiable.&quot; The senshi nodded. &quot;You can pair 
up with people to take shifts if you&#39;re too worried about being here 
alone. Just as long as someone&#39;s with her most of the time.&quot; The senshi 
again nodded.

&quot;What about Yung Hu,&quot; Sailor Moon asked.

&quot;Bring him back to my temple,&quot; Mars said. &quot;I&#39;ll personally see to it he 
has a proper burial.&quot; Raiga nodded and walked over to Yung Hu&#39;s body. 
Chibi Usa looked up at him. She was still crying. Sailor Moon walked 
over and picked her up and cradled her as Raiga picked up Yung Hu in his 
arms. He nodded at Karasu and the rest of the group left for the temple.

There&#39;s not a lot of things to do
I wouldn&#39;t rather do with you
Guess I&#39;m funny that way

Lately I just sit and stare
I talk to people who aren&#39;t there
To get through one night a day

Days after the battle that took Yung Hu&#39;s life and transformed Makoto 
into a green dragon that now stood over fifteen feet tall (she had 
continued to grow until she reached her full height), Chibi Usa sat in 
the attic room that Usagi&#39;s parents had arranged for her, staring out 
over the neighborhood. Since Yung Hu&#39;s funeral which consisted of the 
senshi and the rest of the guardians, she hadn&#39;t even eaten.

Usagi was worried about her, but she didn&#39;t know what to do. On most 
days, Usagi was to be found sitting next to her in the attic, not saying 
anything. Simply sitting there with her future daughter who would 
occasinally mumble to herself. Otherwise, Chibi Usa said nothing.

I sit up with the radio
Sing along with the ones I know
To get through one night a day

One night a day
One step away
From leavin&#39; you behind
Ami sat at her desk, doing her homework. On the desk in a clear space 
sat Raiga, in his cat form, simply looking at her text books, but not 
seeing them. Ami was doing something similar, except somehow she was 
doing her school work without realizing it and getting everything right.
A song played on the radio, a slow, sad, mournful tune. Ami quitly sang 
it to herself as she finished her homework. Raiga looked up and sighed 
then jumped from his place on the desk to curl up on Ami&#39;s bed.
I&#39;m callin&#39; every friend I&#39;ve had
Wake &#39;em up, and make &#39;em mad
Let &#39;em know that I&#39;m OK

I used to sit and talk to you
They&#39;re all just a substitute
To get through one night a day
Minako tossed and turned most nights since the battle. Two weeks had 
passed and Makoto had still not changed back into her normal self. 
Artemis was snoring lightly next to her head. He had taken Yung Hu&#39;s 
death very hard, but had yet to actually mourn over his lost friend. He 
had began to busy himself with gathering information. He began to remind 
Minako of Ami.
Sighing, Minako sat up, picked up her phone and dialed Rei&#39;s number.
&quot;Er..Moshi moshi,&quot; came Rei&#39;s sleepy reply.
&quot;Hi, Rei-chan,&quot; Minako said quietly. She heard Rei groan on the other 
end of the phone.
&quot;Minako, its three in the morning. I&#39;m going back to bed.&quot; Minako then 
heard a soft click on the other end. Sighing again, Minako clicked her 
phone off.
One night a day
One step away
From leavin&#39; you behind

I stay up with the late, late show
Just another way I know
To get through one night a day
Artemis yanwed as he watched the television. After Minako had tried 
calling Rei and then hanging up, Artemis had snuck out of the bedroom 
when Minako had finally fallen asleep. He couldn&#39;t sleep. He had too 
much on his mind.
He heard a soft swishing noise and when he turned his head, he saw Luna 
come thru the cat flap that located next to the balconey door. She 
smiled at him as she approached, but he turned back to the television 
with out returning it.
Luna sighed and padded over to him, layed next to him, and rested her 
head over his back and began to purr quietly. Artemis lowered his head 
to his front paws, tears streaming down his face...
