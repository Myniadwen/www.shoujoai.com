<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 12 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>All of the Senshi were awake now. Michelle, Hotaru, and Mina were in 
wheelchairs because of their injuries. Mina, though not as scratched 
and bruised as everyone else, was in the worst condition. Hyphora&#146;s 
blade had slit through her like nothing and punctured some major 
arteries. Luckily it hadn&#146;t gone all the way through. She was 
recovering fine like the others. 

Neo-King Endymion was another story. He had lost his soul when he had 
helped Hyphora. His loving wife had used the silver crystal on him and 
had regained a large enough portion to awaken him. Now Serenity and 
Terrestria were talking with him, whilst everyone else stayed outside 
to wait. 

&#147; So your hair is going to stay that way sister?&#148; Terrestria giggled 
somewhat. Her hair was still white, with those two chestnut strips 
framing her pretty face, and the random silver strands made it shiver 
as it did before. 

&#147; I&#146;m afraid so, does it look that bad?&#148; he cupped her face gently.

&#147; No, your just as beautiful as ever little sister. Just like my 
darling Serena. Are you still mad at me love?&#148; Serena smiled brightly.

&#147; I can&#146;t stay mad at you. Even after what you&#146;ve done. Terri has 
explained Hyphora to me. She had amazing powers. I just wish you&#146;d had 
told me of the dreams.&#148; He looked away, ashamed at how stupid he was. 
Darien&#146;s face calmed soon as he looked back at them.

&#147; I don&#146;t have many days left.&#148; Serena shook her head.

&#147; Don&#146;t even say that. I&#146;m sure the crystal can heal you.&#148;

&#147; Serena, you would die from the energy drain. And don&#146;t say anything 
about the future. The one we&#146;ve seen was fake.&#148; Darien smiled and 
turned back to his sister.

&#147; I&#146;m sorry for hurting you Terri. She was so convincing and that&#146;s no 
excuse. You&#146;ve come so far with your training and now can control the 
power that was given to you. Terrestria, you have my blessing when you 
marry Rei. &#147; Terri&#146;s eyes sparkled with tears as she hugged her 
brother. 

&#147; Thank you brother. I forgive you, and I&#146;m sure that in time so will 
Rei and the others.

&#147; I&#146;m glad to hear that. Mind if I talk to my wife alone?&#148; She nodded 
and quickly left. The others looked up as she came inside.

&#147; What did he say Terri?&#148; The now white haired goddess bent her head 
down and when it came back up everyone gasped to see the silent tears 
stream down her tan face. Terrestria rarely cried, and it was quite a 
shock and depressing sight. 

&#147; That he doesn&#146;t have much time left. And I know he&#146;s right. The body 
and mind cannot live with out the soul. I don&#146;t know if we&#146;re ever 
going to have a pink haired girl running around this palace.&#148; Rei 
limped over to her dragon, enveloping the woman in a loving hug.

&#147; It&#146;ll be alright Dragon. Don&#146;t worry.&#148;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

Later that night all the Senshi remained at the Crystal Palace. Rei 
and Terri were sitting in their large bed reading a book. Well Terri 
was reading the book, enjoying the feel of her love wrapped in her 
arms. Rei had been quiet all night long as she read. The raven-haired 
beauty shifted a bit and looked up at her white haired girlfriend.

&#147; So did you get that hair color from your mother?&#148; Terri put the book 
on the nightstand and snuggled down a bit. 

&#147; Maybe, I have no idea what she looks like. When I had talked to her 
she had taken my form. Someday though, I&#146;ll meet her.&#148; They turned the 
light off and got comfortable. The rain adding a soft pitter-pat on 
the windows.

&#147; Dragon&#133;where did you meet Hyphora?&#148; Rei felt her stiffen a bit but 
soon relaxed into Rei&#146;s embrace.

&#147; I was 1,013 years old at the time. Or um 14, it was a few months 
after you all had defeated Galaxia. I was in the middle of my training 
when an outer world was starting a war, defeating every planet they 
came across. The world was called Antof-Qoritan. Their leader had set 
it&#146;s sites on us and attacked. I led my army through the war as 
effectively as possible. By the end of the war, I had killed their 
leader, and the only one left of the race was a pretty little girl my 
age. Hyphora wanted to reform and study the path of light. So I 
welcomed her to my kingdom. I trained her as I was and most of what I 
knew. Taref had warned me of the risks of having the enemy with us, 
but I didn&#146;t care. She was a great friend and I loved her dearly as my 
sister. Hyphora had always felt the same, until somewhere down the 
line her feelings changed and her power switched to that of what she 
truly was. She was going to earth to kill you, just to stop me from 
loving you and meeting up with you again. By this time we were 17, and 
I was finished with my training. I had known nothing of my goddess 
form or Universal Destiny. I and when I became the goddess I am meant 
to be, I banished her. Thus loosing any memory of her or the battle. 
It wasn&#146;t even her anymore. I miss her. Hyphora could have gone so 
far.&#148; Terri buried her face in her taller girlfriend&#146;s chest, falling 
asleep soon after. Rei remained awake for awhile longer, watching her. 

- Every one falls in love with her&#133;minus the others. And she only 
loves me. - The Fire Queen smiled impishly and fell asleep.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

A week later his Majesty King Endymion passed away. A beautiful 
service was held and he was buried on a hill where the sun always 
shined bright. Two weeks after that the Senshi were together for 
dinner in the Crystal Palace. They were chatting happily when a 
clinking sound interrupted. Everyone looked towards the cause. Queen 
Rei stood in up in a fine dark red tuxedo. 

&#147; Excuse the interruption, but I would like to do something before I 
lose my nerve. &#147; She walked a few steps over to her girlfriend. 

&#147; Queen Terrestria, if you would please stand.&#148; The planet Queen did 
so as Rei produced a small box. Terri gasped as her love got down on 
bended knee. Rei opened the box. Inside was a delicate sliver ring, 
with smooth round diamond with a small ruby on the left side of it and 
a small black diamond stone on the right. 

&#147; So my dragon, we have your brother&#146;s blessing. Will you be my wife?&#148; 
Terri&#146;s eyes glimmered with tears as she slipped the ring on the right 
finger and hugged Rei.

&#147; Yes, I&#146;d love to!&#148; The other&#146;s shouted for joy. Serena, Mina, and 
Lita had stars in their eyes. 

&#147; So romantic!&#148; They cried out in unison. Serena stayed in place as 
the others hugged the two engaged women.

- I&#146;ll tell them tomorrow.-

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

~ Next Day ~

They were all at the park today, celebrating Rei and Terri&#146;s 
engagement. Serena sat on the blanket waiting for the right time.

- It&#146;s just about time for lunch.- The blonde stood up, waving her 
arms.

&#147; Guys, come eat! We&#146;re hungry!&#148; The girl&#146;s came running. With Hotaru 
riding on Taref&#146;s back. Lita was getting out the food when she had 
realized what her Serena had said. She looked at her Queen. 

&#147; Serena&#133;you said &#145;we&#146;re hungry&#146;.&#148; The rest of the Senshi looked at 
the now blushing blonde. 

&#147; Well, I don&#146;t wanna take Terri and Rei&#146;s spotlight but&#133;I&#146;m pregnant 
with Rini.&#148; Surprise and Happiness stuck to the Senshi&#146;s faces. Terri 
was the first up and hugging the Queen. Loving the fact she had a 
niece to spoil.

&#147; Oh Serena this is great! I&#146;m getting married and your having a kid!&#148; 
She pulled back. 

&#147; Oooo I feel sorry for the palace. If she&#146;s anything like 
you&#133;*laughter in background*&#148; Michelle had stars in her eyes, a rare 
thing.

&#147; Your baby shower is going to be so much fun!&#148;
*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

A few days later they had a baby shower. Even if Serena wasn&#146;t showing 
yet. Ami and Lita gave her baby books and recipe books. With a 
beautiful green and blue shelf to put them on. Amara &amp; Michelle gave 
Serena a navy-blue, teal, and light pink diaper bag, including the 
diapers, bottles, some toys, and formula. Setsuna and Mina&#146;s gift was 
clothes. Lots of baby clothes. Terri and Rei provided the pregnant 
Queen with a cradle of lavender, baby blue, and rose pink. With small 
rubies, diamonds, and amethysts embroidered in here and there. Plus 
some specially designed maternal clothes for when the Queen finally 
did show. Finally Hotaru gave her a deep orchid stroller, with light 
pink bunnies all over it. Hotaru also presented to the Queen a deep 
purple hovering bunny. With a touch of a small button the bunny turned 
into a floating cradle. Just so Serena didn&#146;t have to carry little 
Rini all over. 

&#147; Oh! Everything&#146;s so adorable! I have practically everything I need. 
All that&#146;s left is her room. Thank you!&#148; Somehow Serena managed to 
bear hug each of them at the same time. After that they dug into the 
large cake and other treats. They would relax for now. Until all hell 
breaks loose planning the wedding. </pre>
