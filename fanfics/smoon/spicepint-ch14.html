<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Minako&#39;s POV, apartment, next morning

I...didn&#39;t any sleep at all last night.

I walked out of our bedroom and into the kitchen, yawning as I did so. 
Maybe if I had a glass of cold water it&#39;ll wake me up. One could hope 
couldn&#39;t they?

Without looking I reached up with one of my hands into an upper kitchen 
cabinet and drew out a glass cup while the other busied itself with 
turning on the water. This was all practically routine anyway.

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

&quot;Mm...&quot; I groaned.

Momentarily I forgot about filling my cup. I was too busy wincing in 
pain from the bright light; behind my back the sun was only starting to 
come up. Its warm golden rays came in through the balcony window and 
practically lit up our dark apartment.

How can something so warm make me so sad? Maybe...it was because this 
was my last day... I doubt the demon would want to keep me alive very 
long after the &#39;marriage&#39;. It only wanted my life and soul didn&#39;t it? 
Taking a life didn&#39;t necessarily mean &#39;capture&#39;, it also could mean 
literally killing something. Humph, now I&#39;m thinking like Rei. Another 
double meaning that I&#39;m sure the other woman would love to hear. 
Except...she would probably get the meanings off the bat unlike me.

Great, now I&#39;m grouchy AND sarcastic! It almost made me want to scream 
in frustration. I shouldn&#39;t be so fidgety! It&#39;s all because...

I paused. Already I could feel my thoughts back tracking.

Ooooooh, wait a minute. Even though my eyes have adjusted to the 
sunlight that pain inside still hasn&#39;t gone away. There&#39;s nothing wrong 
with the sun... there&#39;s something wrong with me. Ha! I get it now! I&#39;m 
jealous. The way the sun would always come up predictably everyday was 
making me envious. It&#39;s always warm and always bright. It doesn&#39;t have 
to worry about being snuffed out.

It&#39;s all because of that one thought...dying.

I found myself shaking my head. I&#39;m not afraid of dying... no, I&#39;m 
afraid that I&#39;ll never see Rei-chan again. I mean, I did spend the 
entire night watching her sleep. It&#39;s no wonder I&#39;m exhausted.

But now I&#39;m stuck with the matter of saying good-bye.

What should I do? I can&#39;t tell her anything about my predicament, but I 
also can&#39;t leave without saying good-bye... or could I? Should I leave 
right now and just disappear from her life? Wait, no, no, that would be 
selfish... Then again, what I&#39;m doing is also selfish isn&#39;t it?

...I&#39;m going to leave her behind...

Shhhhhhhhhhhhhh...

&quot;Ah? O-Oh yeah! The water... almost forgot. Silly me.&quot; I placed the cup 
underneath the stream of water until the container was nearly full and 
then turned the knob back the other way until the water flow immediately 
stopped.

There, that wasn&#39;t too hard.

&quot;Can&#39;t sleep?&quot;

I jumped at hearing the voice. When I whirled on the spot I saw Rei was 
sitting at the small table in the kitchen, watching me with alert eyes. 
They were anything but drowsy or relaxed. It irked me that she was 
looking at me so intently but I was also peeved that I hadn&#39;t noticed 
her when I walked in here. What a way to start your last morning in 
life.

In embarrassment.

&quot;Rei! Jeez, don&#39;t go sneaking up on me like that! You almost gave me a 
heart attack,&quot; I placed my hand on my chest for emphasis.

&quot;...What are you hiding?&quot;

She&#39;s in no mood for jokes huh? Okaaaaay.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; I replied and took a sip of my 
water. I pretended to look refreshed by it but inwardly the liquid 
really made me cringe. It only served as another reminder of what I&#39;m 
going to miss after I&#39;m dead.

&quot;You&#39;ve been acting weird ever since we left the studio yesterday. When 
we came back to the apartment I offered to make us something to eat but 
you refused and went straight to bed. And don&#39;t you say it&#39;s because of 
my cooking,&quot; She quickly added. &quot;I would have made you eat something 
first but I figured it was a normal thing to lose your appetite when 
you&#39;re exhausted...However it&#39;s definitely not normal to be as tired now 
as you were last night unless you didn&#39;t get any sleep! What&#39;s bothering 
you?&quot; She demanded.

&quot;Rei...&quot;

I guess I can&#39;t just disappear on you after all...Well scratch that 
plan, she&#39;d probably chase me to the end of the Earth just to scold me 
for it...

With that thought I fell into a giggling fit. How do I always get 
straight answers from indirect responses?

&quot;What&#39;s so funny?&quot; She snapped.

&quot;I-It&#39;s nothing, really, haha... I was just thinking how cute you are 
when you look all annoyed like that,&quot; I walked over and pinched her 
cheeks. &quot;You really are cute, why don&#39;t you give in and admit it?&quot;

&quot;Because I don&#39;t do cute,&quot; Rei pulled away from my grasp. &quot;I&#39;m serious, 
tell me what&#39;s wrong.&quot;

&quot;Persistent little thing aren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re practically the same height,&quot; She huffed. &quot;And stop trying to 
change the subject!&quot;

&quot;All right, all right, take it easy. I just had a bad dream that&#39;s all. 
You sometimes get nightmares too don&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;No, actually I don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Eh---? So lucky...&quot; I retreated again to lean against the kitchen 
counter, still sipping some water occasionally. She was probably fibbing 
just to get me off her case.

As predictable Rei pressed the matter further and asked, &quot;Well, do you 
remember what you dreamt about?&quot;

&quot;Nope. I don&#39;t remember a thing, nothing at all. I remember waking up 
tired and that&#39;s it.&quot; I took another sip.

&quot;...Then nothing&#39;s wrong...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a-okay Rei-chan, I&#39;m good as I&#39;ll ever be.&quot; And that was the truth. 
After today I sure won&#39;t be though. &quot;Why are you worrying so much?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Oh come on, it&#39;s obvious to me that I&#39;m not the only one with something 
on her mind. I told you, so it&#39;s only fair that you tell me.&quot;

Rei turned her head to the side and stared at a wall. &quot;Is it a crime to 
worry about you?&quot;

&quot;Ah, so you were worried about me?&quot;

&quot;Yes! Okay? I was worried about you. Are you happy now?&quot;

Silly of me...Acting unlike myself is only going to cause Rei to worry 
isn&#39;t it? Stupid, stupid, stupid! I should&#39;ve known better. Running away 
without a word isn&#39;t going to make things right. I mean, look how she&#39;s 
reacting because I didn&#39;t get enough sleep!

So...then there&#39;s only one thing to do...

&quot;Yes, I am. Thank you,&quot; I put my glass down on the counter and walked up 
and gave the other woman a big hug. &quot;That means a lot to me...&quot;

&quot;Erm... I&#39;ll make us breakfast now,&quot; Rei suddenly stood up out of my 
embrace and walked over to the fridge. &quot;Try to get a good night&#39;s sleep 
from now on.&quot;

She&#39;s blushing again. I grinned.

For someone who&#39;s changed so much, she really hasn&#39;t changed at all. So 
why should I? If this day will be our last memory together, then it 
should be a happy one right?

I sat down in Rei&#39;s vacant seat and flipped open the newspaper she had 
brought in. As I flipped through the first few pages I noticed that 
there was the usual reported accidents or tragedy, but nothing out of 
the normal. This was one of the reasons why I stopped reading the news; 
it was always so sad and it made me frustrated that I couldn&#39;t do 
anything to help. After all, Sailor Senshi are meant to fight evil 
forces and demonic monsters...but there&#39;s not a lot we can do against 
small crimes that people commit. There&#39;s too many.

&quot;Hey, wait a minute...&quot; I prompt myself up onto my elbows when I found 
the entertainment section. When did this happen?

Huge Showdown between Stars!

Be prepared for a blast of the Century because Raidon Music Enterprises 
and manager Yukio Manuke have announced early this morning that Hino Rei 
and Aino Minako will face each other in a musical showdown where the duo 
made their smash debut concert!

&quot;Both women will prepare five songs a piece. You, the lovely audience 
will have the pleasure of rating the two young woman and ultimately 
decide who&#39;s better of the two.&quot; Manuke graciously commented.

When asked about how Rei and Minako feel about this the man replied, 
&quot;Nervous, I don&#39;t doubt. After all, they are very close &#39;friends&#39;.&quot;

It looks like we can expect a good show, regardless of the outcome. The 
fans, I hear are in a frenzy at the ticket booths to get their seats. 
Better get down there fast before tickets sell out!

--For more information turn to page C3

I slowly looked up from the newspaper article with a feeling of 
disbelief. That demon... it didn&#39;t have to stop with wanting my life and 
soul, but it&#39;s now trying to take away what little time I have left with 
Rei.

By... turning us against each other? Well that&#39;s one thing I won&#39;t let 
it have the satisfaction of.

&quot;Rei, did you know about this competition?&quot;

&quot;What competition? Are we talking about sports or what?&quot; My raven-haired 
companion had just finished her work at the stove and brought over two 
plates loaded with food.

&quot;THIS competition?&quot; I pointed out.

&quot;...&quot; Rei silently took the paper and took a seat beside me. I watched 
her eyes quickly scan down the lines. As time passed, her face was 
setting into a deeper frown than I had ever seen before. &quot;I thought you 
cleared our schedules...&quot; She finally muttered. I expected her to get 
all angry but she was taking this better than I thought.

&quot;But I did! That&#39;s why I&#39;m so surprised. I wasn&#39;t sure whether you 
agreed to do this because I sure didn&#39;t...but since you didn&#39;t either 
then I guess our company made the decision for us.&quot;

This definitely wasn&#39;t my day.

&quot;Then there&#39;s only one thing to do, we&#39;re going to need a little chat 
with our manager.&quot; Rei growled. NOW she looked ticked off.

&quot;Right now?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, Company head office

It turned out that our &#39;dear&#39; manager was out. Like I could care less. 
At least we were able to get a hold of someone.

&quot;My deepest apologies but Manuke is busy with a press conference at the 
moment,&quot; The Company head said. The business man looked to be in his 
fifties. His gray hairs were definitely showing through what little 
natural black he had left.

&quot;That&#39;s good and fine for him. Then maybe you can answer our question, 
what is the meaning of this?&quot; I demanded and threw the paper onto the 
man&#39;s desk. &quot;Ever citizen in the city seems to know about this EXCEPT 
the performers!&quot;

&quot;You mean...you didn&#39;t agree to it?&quot; The man gave us a blank stare. 
&quot;That&#39;s odd. Manuke told me you two were the ones who thought up of the 
idea! And it was such a great gimmick plan that I didn&#39;t question it. Oh 
dear... but we can&#39;t back out of it now!&quot; He sighed, looking frustrated. 
I should be the one who&#39;s frustrated.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Mina asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s obvious to all of us that the fans are ecstatic over 
this. The tickets have already been sold. They&#39;ve been sold out at all 
booths across the city for ten minutes now.&quot;

&quot;Great...&quot; I muttered bitterly. And with Mina-chan being all exhausted, 
I&#39;m sure this is the last thing she needs.

&quot;Then we&#39;ll do it.&quot; Mina suddenly interrupted.

&quot;What? Mina, you aren&#39;t serious are you?&quot;

&quot;What choice do we have?&quot; The blonde replied back. I noticed her clasped 
hands were shaking slightly as she spoke. She took a deep breath before 
reasoning, &quot;It would be a great disappointment for all the people who 
have supported us this far and the tickets are already sold out... But I 
will say this much, if another stunt like this is pulled without our 
consent then I will no longer continue with this company. Do I make 
myself clear?&quot;

The man at the desk paled significantly. It was obvious that he was 
thinking about all the money he&#39;d lose if Mina or I left. &quot;I-I 
understand. I&#39;ll make sure Manuke receives a punishment for this. And if 
something happens again, I&#39;ll even fire him.&quot; He babbled.

&quot;I see...&quot; Mina said calmly, yet to me her eyes seemed distant. I wonder 
if she even realizes what she&#39;s talking about anymore.

Which means... it&#39;s time for us to take our leave.

&quot;Come on Mina, there&#39;s no point in staying any longer. Please excuse us 
sir.&quot; I took her hand and pulled us out of the room.

&quot;Huh? Yeah, okay.&quot;

Minako&#39;s dressing room

Wham!

I hit my fist against a wall. &quot;What do they think they&#39;re doing? Going 
off behind our backs and using us like this?&quot; If Mina&#39;s career weren&#39;t 
on the line, I would have stomped off and quit right there and then.

When I heard nothing but silence I turned on the spot and asked my 
partner, &quot;How can you be so calm?&quot; She actually did look upset about it 
this morning, so why isn&#39;t she saying anything now? It&#39;s not like 
there&#39;s cameras in the room (I checked).

&quot;Come on Rei-chan, chill. It&#39;s not like it&#39;s the end of the world... We 
won&#39;t have to deal with this ever again...you heard the man.&quot;

&quot;But aren&#39;t you at least a little bit frustrated?&quot;

&quot;Of course I am. But you know me, I&#39;m a little too tired to do much 
about it at the moment.&quot; She smiled.

&quot;Right... That&#39;s right...&quot; I paced on the spot. If she insists on going 
through this, then she should be in good health right? &quot;Do you want to 
take a nap now then? If you pass out during the competition from 
exhaustion...&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine,&quot; Mina shook her head.

&quot;Why not? You said you were tired didn&#39;t you?&quot; I said in a flat voice.

&quot;Rei...I don&#39;t have the time to sleep. Not now... Besides, don&#39;t we have 
to prepare five songs each? That could take some time choosing and 
planning if we&#39;re going to do our best!&quot;

&quot;To do our best?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right. Think you can handle it?&quot;

Twitch

&quot;Of course I can! Just because we&#39;re together doesn&#39;t mean that I&#39;m 
going to go easy on you. Now that we&#39;re stuck in this no matter I...&quot; 
What am I thinking? I was starting to get a feeling of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu but then 
I lost the thought. Inwardly I shrugged, it couldn&#39;t be that important 
if I forgot it right? &quot;Ah, never mind... but I will definitely give it 
my all.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good to hear,&quot; The blonde laughed.

There was a short pause that followed.

&quot;Erm...so I guess I should leave and get ready.&quot; I don&#39;t want to be a 
distraction to her...

&quot;Actually...if it&#39;s not too much to ask, could you stay? If you don&#39;t 
want to sit next to me you can sit on that couch,&quot; Mina pointed to the 
black leather furniture across the room.

Hmm, I guess that could work... Truthfully I&#39;d rather be in here with 
Mina than being out in the hallway. My songs are rather personal. If 
anyone saw me writing something so mushy I might die from embarrassment.

&quot;Okay.&quot;

I walked over to her dressing desk and opened a particular drawer to 
pick out a pen and a blue clipboard. Inside the clipboard there were 
various musical song pieces that I scribbled down when Mina and I were 
brainstorming for our music project awhile back. Most of the writing was 
in fragments though. There wasn&#39;t anything too together or complete. In 
a sense it was like trying to fit together pieces of a puzzle except you 
had to find the right pieces to use as well.

Taking my supplies with me I sat down at the other end of the room and 
began analyzing what I had to work with. I knew I had two songs already 
done and were sitting in &#39;storage&#39;. They were supposed be in our albums 
later on... but this was an emergency. I could always write more if 
necessary later.

I dumped the papers onto my lap and began to shuffle through them before 
sorting them all into like-matching piles. First I needed to find &#39;like&#39; 
lyrics that would fit together...

...Now with these pieces...I might be able to put them here...

Sometime later

Time ticked by without both of us seeming to notice. Throughout most of 
the time, Mina and I were absorbed in our work. Or at least I was. I was 
pretty sure Mina was too because she looked like it.

...Although I have to admit it sometimes felt like someone was staring 
at me the entire time, just like when I was trying to sleep last night. 
I must have been imagining it though because every time I looked up, my 
blonde companion was deep in her work.

Song four done... I took a deep breath. &quot;One to go.&quot;

&quot;Mm?&quot; Mina looked up.

Seeing I had her attention I asked her, &quot;I said I only have one more 
song to go. How are you making out?&quot;

The silence actually had been starting to get to me. I was glad to start 
a conversation. It&#39;s easy to work in silence while meditating but when 
you&#39;re in a bright room meant for an enthusiastic singer it&#39;s a little 
hard to take it easy. You expect the place to be noisy.

&quot;I&#39;m all done.&quot; She grinned.

WHAT?

&quot;Really? Since when?&quot;

&quot;For awhile...&quot; Her blue eyes danced with a mysterious light. That 
couldn&#39;t be a good sign. Maybe I wasn&#39;t imagining the staring after all.

&quot;...Hey Mina-chan, remember when you asked if I was happy with my life 
yesterday?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Are you happy with yours?&quot;

&quot;With mine...?&quot; She blinked and then paused as she put on a thoughtful 
expression. A smile slowly formed on her lips. I wondered what sort of 
memories she was thinking about. It almost made me envious that she 
didn&#39;t have blanks in hers.

When I thought I saw tears beginning to form in her eyes, I brought 
myself to blink only to see they were gone.

Maybe I&#39;m the one who hasn&#39;t gotten enough sleep. I shook my head. First 
I get all worked up because she had a nightmare, then I think I&#39;m being 
stared at when I&#39;m actually not... Now I&#39;m having hallucinations of Mina 
tearing up.

&quot;Of course I&#39;m happy with my life. I admit it was hard at first, moving 
here all the way from England... but if I never moved here I wouldn&#39;t 
have gotten the chance to meet such great friends. Usagi, Ami, Makoto, 
you and well, everyone... Knowing that you have friends to count on no 
matter what is almost the best feeling in the world! It&#39;s nice to know 
that you belong somewhere, that your life has a purpose...even if it&#39;s 
hard,&quot; She gave a small laugh. &quot;But like you said Rei-chan, life 
wouldn&#39;t be life without some struggling right?&quot;

&quot;Y-Yeah...&quot;

&quot;Mm... It might be a bit early to say, but I don&#39;t intend on living my 
life with regrets...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, way too early. You&#39;ve got a long time to go.&quot; I tried to tell 
her.

She suddenly looks so tired... or am I imagining that too?

&quot;Let&#39;s do our best okay?&quot;

&quot;Mina? Hey!&quot;

I shot up and ran over to the other couch as she fell sideways into the 
soft cushions. My heart must have been racing 100 mph with worry. What 
if she collapsed?

That theory was immediately thrown out the window when Mina blinked up 
sleepily at me.

&quot;Sorry... I don&#39;t think I can stay awake,&quot; She made a goofy grin.

I was just relieved that it wasn&#39;t anything more serious. &quot;Then you 
should sleep. Not getting a good night&#39;s rest has finally caught up to 
you. I&#39;ll wake you up before our competition, how does that sound?&quot;

Mina gave a weak nod. &quot;Hey Rei?&quot;

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m really glad to have met you...&quot;

She then closed her eyes and fell into a deep slumber, leaving me there 
to ponder what I just heard.

I then took off my jacket and then laid it over her sleeping form with a 
smile playing on my own lips.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to have met you too Mina-chan. Sweet dreams...&quot;

Outside the room

Click.

Maybe I should try to find a better blanket... my jacket might not be 
enough...

&quot;Now that I think about it, there might be some in the supply room.&quot; I 
reminded myself.

I starting walking and made my way down the hallways. Getting lost 
wasn&#39;t an issue as it was the first time Mina and I came here. After 
coming to this place so much I couldn&#39;t help but memorize my way around 
the place. It was &#39;survival of the fittest&#39;, as Mina would say.

I had to chuckle at that. She really says some silly things sometimes... 
Unlike today...

I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;m still getting the feeling that it&#39;s not only a 
nightmare that&#39;s on her mind. The way she keeps spacing out on me, the 
lack of sleep, her odd comments... it&#39;s almost as if she was afraid to 
lose time.

Which is absolutely silly isn&#39;t it? We&#39;re still young. We&#39;ve got maybe 
seventy years to go, give or take.

But... if it isn&#39;t sleep that&#39;s bothering her... and we weren&#39;t 
together, I would have said it was &#39;boy trouble&#39;. I felt myself frown. 
Am I doing something wrong?

&quot;Hello miss, may I help you?&quot; A woman looking in her late thirties 
addressed me.

&quot;Hm...?&quot; When I glanced around at my surroundings I realized that I 
wandered to the supply room without noticing it. On the bright side, at 
least my feet knew where to go. &quot;Yes, is it possible to get a blanket 
and a pillow?&quot;

&quot;Planning on catching a nap? No problem, may I see some I.D?&quot;

I reached into my pocket and handed her my company identification card.

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re Hino Rei! You look a little different up close. My 
daughter is a huge fan of yours. Tell me, are you nervous about today&#39;s 
competition? I can say no one I know thought something like this would 
happen so suddenly; none of us were expecting it.&quot;

&quot;Neither did I...&quot; I grumbled.

&quot;...Did you say something?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing at all.&quot;

The woman turned her back to picked off a blanket and a pillow from the 
shelves but paused with her hand mid-air. &quot;I&#39;m assuming this is for you, 
correct?&quot;

&quot;No, it&#39;s for Mina.&quot;

&quot;Ah! So you came to get her something to be comfy in? That&#39;s so sweet of 
you. I imagine the poor dear is all tuckered out with all the 
excitement. Today is her big day, you know?&quot;

I shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s only a competition... what&#39;s so special about that? 
You make it sound like she&#39;s getting married or something.&quot;

The woman handed me a large blanket and two pillows. &quot;Well...that&#39;s 
exactly it isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Was I hearing things?

&quot;Oh no... she didn&#39;t tell you? I thought she would have since you two 
looked so close... Manuke told me about it before he left for his 
meeting. Both of them apparently are planning to tie the knot this 
evening at some small chapel east of the city. I know I haven&#39;t gotten 
any invitation and neither has any other company employee that I&#39;ve 
conversed with so it must be a private event. But don&#39;t fret dear, I&#39;m 
sure Aino san will give you her invitation.&quot;

To me the room suddenly dropped to freezing temperatures.

Why wasn&#39;t I told about this? And with Manuke no less! I don&#39;t 
understand. Was what she told me yesterday...and today... was it all a 
lie? No, that can&#39;t be it! Mina wouldn&#39;t do something like that. It had 
to be Manuke. After all, he tried to kill me once to get to Mina. 
Blackmailing isn&#39;t that far down the crime list.

&quot;Hino san?&quot;

&quot;Thank for informing me of the event. I am sure &#39;Aino san&#39; will extend 
an invitation to me before the evening is up. Now if you do not mind, I 
shall take my leave,&quot; I said coolly and made my way back to Mina&#39;s 
dressing room. Perhaps I should have been nicer but right now I couldn&#39;t 
help it.

No wonder Mina seemed troubled. Being forced to marry that pathetic 
excuse for a man would make any decent woman hurl-or in this case, lose 
sleep.

My hands clenched the sleeping supplies tightly in my arms. &quot;He&#39;s gone 
too far...&quot;

I will not allow him to use Mina! I won&#39;t let him...

I&#39;m done with saying good-byes.

I meant every word...

Minako&#39;s POV, later, early evening

Creeeeak.

&quot;Mm...?&quot; I automatically flinched when a bright light suddenly hit me. 
At first I thought it was the sun again but I quickly reminded myself 
that I fell asleep in my dressing room. By the sounds of it, someone had 
only opened the door. &quot;Rei?&quot; I called out.

Tup...tup...tup...

&quot;Rei?&quot; I tried again. Ow, why does the light always hurt when you first 
wake up? I managed to open my eyes enough to see her figure standing 
beside me. As I shuffled to move, I suddenly noticed that a blanket 
covered me and a few pillows were lying where my head was only seconds 
before. Did she get all this for me?

Rei placed something down on the table beside the couch before heading 
back out the door.

&quot;Rei, wait up-&quot;

&quot;Time to get up. I&#39;ll see you on stage.&quot;

&quot;Rei...?&quot;

Tup...tup...tup...

What did she mean by that? Why didn&#39;t she wait for me?

Once my eyes adjusted to the light level I glanced over to the table and 
a small gasp escaped me. A red rose? My hand went out to touch the red 
petals. Feeling their softness confirmed to me that it was real, Rei 
really gave me a rose.

&quot;It&#39;s so beautiful...&quot;

I gently picked it up and then cradled it in my hands. Red, the color of 
blood...how fitting... The thought again sparked the sadness I felt 
inside, the same I felt from this morning. Look what I&#39;ve become. 
Someone filled with thoughts of my own death that I would compare a rose 
to it... I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t what Rei had in mind when she gave it to me.

...Wasn&#39;t a rose... also a symbol of love? What happened to the warmth 
that I used to carry?

Love...

I don&#39;t regret my decision. But is it wrong for a person to fear death 
when you know your fate is eternal torture?

&quot;Pfft, Rei probably wouldn&#39;t approve. I have to be strong...&quot; No fear is 
going to make me change my mind.

My fingers trailed up and down the rose&#39;s stem, only to hit a small 
bump. Having found it one of my fingers kept going over it, trying to 
identify what it was. It didn&#39;t feel like one of the thorns.

Huh? &quot;What&#39;s this? A note?&quot;

Using one of my hands I opened the small card and held it up to my face.

Good luck Mina-chan.

&quot;Rei...&quot;

It still amazes me... how you can say so much without saying anything at 
all.

Stage, start of show

Rei was dressed up in her casual wear and was standing opposite of me on 
the other side of the stage. And as usual I was all dressed up in my 
singer outfit.

For a moment I thought our gazes met before the stage lights came on and 
revealed our locations.

Good luck Rei chan...

CLICK- Clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk!

All around I could see the large screens on the stadium walls come to 
life as the fan&#39;s screams rocked the place.

&quot;WOOOOOOOOOO!&quot;

&quot;There they are!&quot;

&quot;Hell ya!&quot;

&quot;Go Aino san!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m rooting for Rei san...&quot;

&quot;Actually I like them both.&quot;

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen!&quot; The announcer&#39;s voice came booming over the loud 
cheering. &quot;To all you people who managed to grab seats for this exciting 
event, consider yourselves lucky! You get to see this live! And to all 
those who are watching this from their television screens at home, I 
also hope you will also enjoy the experience regardless. Ahem... getting 
on with the show here, both Hino and Aino san will be performing five 
different songs apiece. Everyone in the audience, please look down at 
your hand held counter. After each round, if you think Hino san 
performed the round better, press the red button on the left. But if you 
think Aino san performed the round better, press the orange button 
beside it on the right. Very simple right? Good, then let&#39;s get 
underway! Aino san will open the competition with her song, &#39;C&#39;est la 
vie&#39;.&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV

&quot;This warm feeling is c&#39;est la vie

As long as I am me

C&#39;est la vie, I want to keep on being in love with you

Running through the place where this moment lives
Right in front of me&quot;

She&#39;s really good...Heh, but what else can I expect from Mina chan? 
She&#39;s amazing... I just hope I can compete...

...Although, I still can&#39;t help but worry about this whole wedding 
business. When will Manuke come to get her? After the concert perhaps? I 
waited outside her dressing room door the entire time she was sleeping 
and I never sensed him anywhere. Then that must be his plan!

&quot;Running through the place where this moment lives

Right in front of me
Right in front of me&quot;

Until then...I should concentrate on my own songs. We said we&#39;d do our 
best, so I&#39;ll do my best!

&quot;Thank you Aino san for that wonderful song! Next up we have Hino san 
with &#39;Stars Fall at Dawn&#39;.&quot;

Okay... Take a deep breath... here goes. I brought the microphone up to 
my mouth.

Minako&#39;s POV

&quot;Honestly, in my warm heart I want to wait for dawn, but

I have no choice but to proceed from here with my own feet

That time, you gave to me the strength to go through life alone

Everything came from your smile

If the stars shine through the darkness and answer my prayer
My single wish, to unlock my spirit&quot;

To unlock your spirit...? Don&#39;t worry Rei. That&#39;ll come soon... very 
soon...
I couldn&#39;t care less who wins or loses this competition. It doesn&#39;t 
matter to me. Both Rei and me, we might&#39;ve not spent this day the way I 
wanted us to, but at least we were able to be together for that little 
bit while we prepared our songs. I don&#39;t know if she knew it or not, but 
I couldn&#39;t help but watch her. The way she would get into her work in 
concentration despite what&#39;s happened to her so far. Losing her 
grandpa... Mar&#39;s soul...being forced into this competition... She really 
is a strong person.

My hands came up to touch the rose in my hair. I had cut the stem and 
thorns so it would fit.

I&#39;ll get it back for you. Please wait a little longer.

...I won&#39;t live my life with regrets...

Rei&#39;s POV, end of song

&quot;And there we have it, round one has been completed! As instructed 
earlier, please either press the red button for Hino san or the orange 
button for Aino san.&quot;

Bleep. Bleep, bleep, bleep...

The sound of the audience pressing their buttons gained momentum. I 
glanced up at one of the two score boards in the stadium to where the 
results were being electronically tallied.

&quot;Well, well, looks like Aino san is leading Hino san by a few points. 
BUT it&#39;s still close! Three rounds to go before we take a break and then 
the grand finale! Is everyone excited? I know I am! So let&#39;s get going 
with Rei to start off round 2 with &#39;Cherry Blossom Storm&#39;!&quot;

&quot;Grasping the cool flower petals tightly

I felt as if I saw a break in the clouds
Going on forever...&quot;

Later on after the end of round four

&quot;Amazing! Folks I think we have just seen the impossible. Hino san has 
pulled off a spectacular come back, to tie Aino san going into the fifth 
and final round. And as promised, we&#39;ll give our two stars a 
well-deserved break. See you soon everyone!&quot;

The lights dimmed and then I made my way backstage. It&#39;s so warm out 
there and my head hurts from all the loud noise.

&quot;I need a glass of water.&quot; I mumbled to myself.

Tup! Tup! Tup!

The sudden sound of footsteps caught my attention. &quot;Wha----- OOF!&quot;

Collide, thud

Shit, what&#39;s going on?

&quot;Ow, ow, ow! I-I&#39;m really sorry, I should&#39;ve been watching where I was 
going. Sometimes I can be such a klutz. Are you-&quot;

&quot;Usagi? What the hell are you doing here? And where did you run off last 
time without saying a word?&quot; I demanded the woman. This was definitely 
the last place I&#39;d expect us to bump into each other.

&quot;No time! Where&#39;s Mina, Rei?&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan? What are you talking about? Didn&#39;t you see her on your &#39;run&#39; 
here...? She&#39;s supposed to be on the other end of the stage, where YOU 
came from.&quot;

Come to think of it, I hadn&#39;t seen her since we disappeared behind 
stage. And then I run into a frantic looking Usag--

DAMN!

&quot;I&#39;ve got to go Usagi!&quot;

&quot;Rei, wait!&quot; But I had already left.

What if... what if the competition was just another distraction...?

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

Wham!

I threw open the backstage door that lead into the back parking lot. A 
gust of wind hit my face. With the dark clouds overhead I was easily 
able to make out Mina standing between two large bodyguards.

I recognized the men immediately. Their uniforms were exactly like the 
group that had tried to kill me off awhile back.

&quot;MINA!&quot;

I saw Mina&#39;s head shot up at the call of her name.

&quot;Rei...?&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t think about touching her!&quot; I was running towards the three now 
with my hands raised. There was another pair of footsteps following but 
sensed it was Usagi close behind me.

&quot;Shit, guess it&#39;s not going to be easy after all...&quot; One of the 
bodyguards said as he dug his hand into his suit pocket.

&quot;Wait, you can&#39;t!&quot; Mina grabbed his arm. Instantly the man threw her 
back to his partner. &quot;Ah!&quot;

&quot;Shut up, all we gotta do is deliver you. Manuke didn&#39;t say anything 
about sparing the Hino girl...&quot;

&quot;Rei, watch out!&quot; Usagi called out.

A gun? Is that all they got?

Bam!

I dodged right.

How...annoying! &quot;RAH!&quot; My fist shot out and connected with the man&#39;s 
face, forcing him to drop the weapon. I was satisfied to hear his 
sunglasses break upon contact.

Crunch

&quot;AH! My glasses, you broke them!&quot; He howled.

&quot;Forget about her!&quot; The other bodyguard warned. But it was too late, 
Usagi had placed herself behind him and when I kicked the man, he 
tripped backwards over Odango.

Whack! Thud!

&quot;Oooooh...&quot; The injured man groaned.

&quot;One down, one to go!&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot;

The last standing bodyguard let go of Mina and ran full speed to meet 
us. Without a word, Usagi lunged with a kick at his legs while I shot up 
with a flying kick. An odd feeling poured over me. What we were doing 
felt really familiar... Why did I just do that?

The man ducked back to avoid my attack but he was caught flat footed on 
Usagi&#39;s.

WHUP!

&quot;Ugh..!&quot;

Thud.

&quot;It worked...&quot; I stared shocked at the fallen man. Just like our combo 
attack on the first guy... &quot;Good move Usagi, it looks like even you can 
be serious when you put your mind to it. Where did you learn all those 
moves anyway?&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot; Usagi stared at me with a scared look on her face.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;T-Turn around...&quot;

Ca-click.

What? But I thought we took them all out! I turned around to see a gun 
in my face, but it wasn&#39;t held by any bodyguard...

&quot;Mina...chan...?&quot;

DOOOOOM

&quot;What are you doing Mina?&quot; Usagi shouted. &quot;Put that down!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;I...As your future queen, I command you to drop the gun now!&quot;

&quot;Future queen? Have you gone nuts Usagi? What are you talking about? 
This isn&#39;t the time to fool around.&quot; I shot Odango a look.

&quot;See? She really doesn&#39;t remember. So I have to do this, even if...even 
if it&#39;s to disobey you!&quot; Mina shouted back.

Remember what?

&quot;Disobey... what wrong with you two?&quot; I demanded. When I searched their 
faces I saw Usagi had looked away and Mina hung her head down. &quot;This 
isn&#39;t funny, somebody better tell me what&#39;s going on right now!&quot;

A hand cupped my cheek, bringing me to look up into Mina&#39;s sad blue 
eyes.

&quot;Mina chan?&quot;

She leaned in and began to whisper into my ear. I felt my eyes go wide.

What...are you saying...?

&quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; The back of the gun came crashing down.

HUH? Crack!

&quot;Ah..!&quot;

Thud!

From the ground my sight was starting to disappear around me. Things 
became dark around the sides of my vision and swirled towards the center 
where I could only see Mina joining the two recovered bodyguards.

...Mina...chan...

All went dark.

Usagi&#39;s POV, Hikawa Shrine

Somehow I had managed to carry Rei back to the shrine. And it wasn&#39;t 
easy. She&#39;s heavier than I last remembered. I even had to transform just 
to carry out the simple task.

Now...I was watching Rei carefully in case she was going to wake up any 
moment. I can only guess how she will react when she wakes up.

This mess... why did it all happen? Could it have been avoided if the 
amulet didn&#39;t crack? If we had finished the monster instead of trapping 
it in our past lives? Or perhaps if I had tracked it down sooner!

Mina... When I close my eyes I can see happen all over again.

Crack! Thud!

&quot;Why? Why did you do that?&quot; I shouted. &quot;Don&#39;t you care about her 
anymore?&quot;

Mina dropped the gun. &quot;Usagi... I have to do this.&quot;

&quot;By walking into a trap?&quot;

&quot;... No, by getting Mar&#39;s soul back to Rei.&quot;

I thought she was more responsible than this! She&#39;s supposed to be a 
leader. Going into things alone isn&#39;t going to help anyone. &quot;Mina!&quot;

Mina slowly turned around once more. What I saw caught the rest of my 
words at the back of my throat. I couldn&#39;t talk.

She was crying...

&quot;Usagi? Please... take care of Rei for me.&quot;

I could only watch her leave. I couldn&#39;t do anything... because she 
wants to...

&quot;...My head hurts...&quot; Rei suddenly groaned and began to shuffle around.

She&#39;s awake? &quot;Wait, don&#39;t move so quickly. Your...I...&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;s Mina?&quot; The woman ignored me and bolted upright. Her amethyst 
eyes darted around the room in confusion. &quot;Why am I back at the shrine?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not here...&quot;

&quot;What? Why didn&#39;t you stop her?&quot;

&quot;Because I wasn&#39;t strong enough.&quot;

No matter how hard I would plead, she wouldn&#39;t change her mind. Because, 
it isn&#39;t me that can save her. I&#39;m... such a failure.

&quot;...Did...did you at least try? Mina chan...&quot;

Plip, plip...

Please don&#39;t cry Rei, or I&#39;ll cry too. I... But it was too late. I know 
I cry more easily than Rei does but this-I wish I could be stronger too.

&quot;I did try. But she won&#39;t listen to me. Rei, do you know what we were 
talking about in the parking lot?&quot;

Rei shook her head. &quot;...&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t understand what we were talking about because you don&#39;t 
remember. Your memories... there are blanks in them aren&#39;t there?&quot;

&quot;How... did you know?&quot;

Our eyes met.

&quot;What I&#39;m about to tell you... you just have to trust me. I won&#39;t be 
able to tell you everything with the time we have but I can at least 
tell you why Mina left. Please listen to what I have to say.&quot;

Rei narrowed her eyes. &quot;...I&#39;m listening.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot; I tested my own voice. &quot;You are...&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, on the way to the chapel

With my bow slung over one shoulder and a bundle arrows in a bag on my 
back I sprinted as fast as my legs would carry me to the chapel. To my 
fortune, the place wasn&#39;t too far from the shrine.

I can only hope that I&#39;ll make it in time!

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

&quot;Hah...hah...&quot;

&quot;You are... Sailor Mars, one of the inner senshi that have protected my 
family for millennia.&quot;

&quot;Me? No way, I don&#39;t believe it. I&#39;m only an ordinary person...&quot; I 
trailed off.

&quot;An ordinary person that has psychic abilities and a heightened 
intuition? Or perhaps a priestess with an unnatural mastery of flame? 
Rei, you can deny it all you want but that&#39;s who you are. Mina-chan 
isn&#39;t the normal person you think her to be right now either. She&#39;s 
Sailor Venus, also our comrade for many years.&quot;

&quot;Mina chan was? Then who are you?&quot;

&quot;Sailor Moon. Can&#39;t you sense my power?&quot;

&quot;This is stupid.&quot; I tried turning away.

&quot;Just try.&quot;

When Usagi gripped my hand I couldn&#39;t help but yelp and jump back at the 
shock I felt. There was a sudden connection. She really did have a lot 
of power... And strangely enough, it felt familiar. It was the same 
feeling I got during our fight with the bodyguards. That was when I 
began to have seconds thoughts about her story.

Minako&#39;s POV, inside chapel

Manuke (or the demon I should say) and I stood at the front of the empty 
room. There was no other person other than the priest who was going to 
perform the ceremony.

&quot;You look very beautiful,&quot; The demon said, although I knew it was 
laughing itself to death on the inside. I really wish it were dead.

This wedding gown...that creep said it was &#39;essential and the wedding 
could not proceed without the bride all dressed up&#39;. It was one big 
joke. Right now the coldness of the room had nothing on how cold I felt 
inside.

&quot;Ah? Where did you get that &#39;sweet pea&#39;?&quot; The demon extended its hand 
toward the rose in my hair.

I tried to move back but its hand shot forward and grasped the flower 
hard, only be to be pricked by a thorn. &quot;OW!&quot; It pulled back immediately 
and sucked on the wound.

That&#39;s odd... I thought I cut off all the thorns. Where did I miss one?

...Rei... it almost feels like she&#39;s still here with me.

&quot;Sorry &#39;dear&#39;, perhaps you should be more careful next time.&quot; I gave a 
grin while secretly thinking you deserved that.

&quot;Let&#39;s just get going already!&quot; The demon snapped.

&quot;Y-Yes sir...now let&#39;s see...we are all gathered here today...&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, outside the chapel

I stopped quickly and glanced around for more guards. Those goons are 
always around, why should this be an exception? It was no longer a 
surprise when I heard a voice mocking me.

&quot;You never learn to quit do you?&quot; I whirled around.

Bam!

Minako&#39;s POV, inside the chapel

Did I just hear a gunshot?

&quot;Quickly, skip ahead a bit. This is taking too long!&quot; The demon ordered 
the elderly man.

Unconsciously my hand came up to touch the rose again. Could it be...?

&quot;GAH!&quot;

Thud.

&quot;If anyone has any objections please say so now or forever, hold your 
peace.&quot;

Tup! Tup! Tup!

&quot;There&#39;s one RIGHT HERE!&quot; The miko&#39;s bloodied form stomped in along the 
front isle. I noticed a large wound on her arm but the woman seemed to 
pay it no mind. If anything Rei was blazing with battle energy.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

Why did she come?

Rei&#39;s POV

&quot;Demon! Release her now!&quot; Despite my own heavy breathing and minor 
exhaustion I brought my bow up and drew an arrow back, targeting the 
fake man in front of me.

I still could remember Usagi&#39;s words...

&quot;The demon is able to shape shift once it has a living human body to 
work with. That&#39;s why I haven&#39;t been able to track it.&quot;

&quot;Shape shift?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s able to change its form into any soul it&#39;s collected... I 
suspect Mina is trying to strike a deal with it to get Mar&#39;s soul back 
for you.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Now isn&#39;t that interesting...?&quot; The demon muttered and cocked its 
head to the side. Behind the &#39;couple&#39; I could see the priest already 
making tracks for the door. &quot;You aren&#39;t supposed to remember anything.&quot;

My eyes moved from the demon and stopped briefly on Mina before 
returning my gaze back to my opponent. &quot;Yeah? Well that&#39;s too bad for 
you. I said let her go.&quot;

&quot;Rei, you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re doing!&quot; Mina tried to protest. 
&quot;Just...go home!&quot;

&quot;Hmm, yes, listen to the woman Rei chan. I think that would be best.&quot;

&quot;Shut up!&quot;

&quot;How rude...I suppose you won&#39;t just leave?&quot;

&quot;What do you take me for?&quot;

The demon narrowed its eyes. I noticed how it quickly glanced over at my 
bow before muttering again, &quot;Interesting... Are you saying you still 
love this woman?&quot; To my anger it dared to wrap one of its filthy arms 
around Mina&#39;s shoulders. I could see the disgusted look on the blonde&#39;s 
face. My own might have been exactly like hers if I weren&#39;t so angry.

My blood was boiling... I just wanted to kill it... All I could see was 
red. Keeping myself calm was becoming very difficult to do. How easy it 
would be to release this arrow...

&quot;You can try firing that arrow...&quot; The demon &#39;kindly&#39; pointed out. &quot;But 
if you kill me, Mar&#39;s soul will be gone as well. You&#39;ll never get it 
back,&quot; It paused. And then a very twisted expression decorated its face. 
The face was definitely closer to demonic than human now. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you 
what. I&#39;m a generous demon. You can have a choice Rei-chan... Mar&#39;s 
soul, the source of your missing memories and Senshi power...or this 
worthless woman.&quot;

&quot;Ah!&quot; It pulled Mina closer. My shoulders tensed but I forced myself to 
relax; if the wrong muscles are used then my shot is as good as no shot 
at all.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you want to remember who you were? And imagine the power you 
would regain! You can go back to playing hero again. Besides, it&#39;s what 
this dumb blonde wanted to get back for you, even though she knows it 
would cost her an eternity of torture. Isn&#39;t it sweet?&quot;

&quot;Mina... is it true...?&quot;

But I wasn&#39;t talking about what the demon was rambling on about. What 
she said to me before she knocked me out...

&quot;Whatever may happen, my love is for you and only you. Good-bye 
Rei-chan.&quot;

Our eyes met and somehow she caught on. In one simple word she answered, 
&quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;See? I told you.&quot; The demon went on. &quot;Now choose Hino Rei! Which is 
truly the other half to your soul?&quot;

The other half to my soul...

&quot;I could get my memories back...find out who I used to be and what I 
am...and even power. Maybe what Usagi said was true, perhaps I really 
was some super hero and part of the Sailor Senshi team. Wouldn&#39;t that be 
something? To know I was a part of something bigger with a purpose.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right...Go on...&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot; Mina whispered.

&quot;If I had a future that didn&#39;t have to be death... if I had a future 
where I wouldn&#39;t be looked down on because of these strange 
abilities...&quot;

&quot;Exactly. Now we&#39;re getting somewhere... Your choice?&quot;

I closed my eyes. &quot;The other half to my soul...&quot; and then they shot 
open, &quot;is in your arms! I won&#39;t repeat myself again, I SAID LET HER GO!&quot;

&quot;WHAT?&quot;

&quot;Rei! It can-&quot; I heard Mina scream.

&quot;Shut up!&quot; The demon threw the blonde aside, sparking another fire of 
rage deep inside me. &quot;Hahaha, if that&#39;s your choice... then I&#39;ll just 
have to beat you with the powers you once coveted. You could have had it 
all back but you choose some woman? Taste some humility former Senshi of 
Mars!&quot;

Before I could release my arrow a surge of dark energy surrounding the 
laughing demon. I resisted the urge to step back and continued to watch 
the energy build. This is what Usagi must&#39;ve meant by it changing 
forms... if it could use any soul then...

FSSSSSSSSSSSSSssssssshhhhh...

I forced my eyes to stay open against the rush of wind.

Wait a minute, is the energy dying down?

The demon also looked surprised. &quot;W-What? Why can&#39;t I change...? Ah, 
damn it all to hell! Even in death Mars, are you willing to sacrifice 
yourself to save that woman as well?&quot; I saw it&#39;s hateful gaze train on 
me. &quot;Those same eyes... You both really are thorns in the side! You and 
your so called feelings of love. Ha! Well you still can&#39;t kill me or 
you&#39;ll kill Mars too. Permanently. And you don&#39;t want that do you?&quot; The 
demon&#39;s energy had died down completely. I realized that I could release 
the arrow at any time.

&quot;...&quot; My grip was already beginning to loosen from my sweaty fingers. 
Exhaustion of holding this pose was starting to wear on me.

SHROOOM

A dark shadow behind the man&#39;s body drew my attention.

Mars?

The Senshi of fire stood directly behind the demon and was watching me 
with searching eyes that mirrored my own.

She really was something... the way she looked in her sailor fuku and 
that intense power radiating from her very being. Mars was standing 
there tall and proud in all of her glory.

She really is the Goddess of War...

&quot;What are you staring at?&quot; The demon demanded but I ignored it. I 
refused to break eye contact with Mars.

Even if I lose my memories... and even... if I lose my powers forever... 
I&#39;ll still do it for Mina-chan! Do you hear me! I mentally shouted to 
Mars, hoping she would hear my heart.

&quot;Then so be it!&quot; I shouted and answered the demon&#39;s question aloud.

Mars suddenly nodded.

A strong wind suddenly picked up again but it was specifically around me 
this time. It blew upward, pushing my clothing against my body and my 
hair flying behind me.

&quot;It can&#39;t be!&quot; The demon shouted.

A circle of flames then shot up in my vision.

SHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

What&#39;s this power? It... It feels like it&#39;s flooding into me!

&quot;How...&quot; My opponent was trembling violently.

Beside the demon Mina&#39;s eyes had widened. &quot;She&#39;s...&quot;

The flames exploded upward into a column and then immediately fell down 
towards me, engulfing me in a warm light. The fire became something I 
never expected. Instead of being in my miko outfit I found myself in 
Mar&#39;s sailor fuku. And instead of being Hino Rei, I was Mars.

...No... that wasn&#39;t true, because we&#39;re one and the same. I&#39;ve never 
realized it but I was afraid of myself this entire time. If I had 
listened to my own heart instead of my fears, I would have been able to 
heard Mar&#39;s voice echoing inside of me, telling me everything would be 
all right.

After all this time... I finally can hear it.

Re-awaken young one...

Yes...

FLAAAAAAAASH!

&quot;In the name of Mars, I shall punish you!&quot; I lifted my hand and an arrow 
of fire formed. In the other a similar type of bow materialized. I then 
drew the flame back in its proper place.

&quot;Wait! I still have a legal contract with the woman.&quot; The demon tried to 
protest. &quot;If I gave your soul back, hers would belong to me! Even you 
cannot go back on such a deal. It was made by blood contract!&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t &#39;give&#39; it back to me, that was never your intent. Thus the 
contract is null and void! Now disappear from our sight! 
Mars...Flame...SNIPER!&quot;

CRACKLE!

&quot;GAAAAAAAAAAAH! This can&#39;t be happening!&quot;

The demon&#39;s body began to disintegrate into dust.

&quot;My flame will turn all evil to ash...&quot; I turned around and as I made my 
way towards the exit I de-transformed. I was about to leave altogether 
when I heard a familiar voice call me.

The things I said... the battles we all fought...

&quot;Rei...?&quot;

&quot;...Mina-chan, I remember everything...&quot;

&quot;I-I see...&quot;

&quot;Do you remember when you asked me if I was happy with my life?&quot;

&quot;Huh? ...Mm...&quot; She made an affirmative noise.

&quot;I was happy.&quot;

&quot;Then why did you-!&quot; Mina was about to protest but abruptly stopped when 
I held my hand up for silence.

&quot;Listen to me! It didn&#39;t matter which life it was. I was happy not 
because of some memory... but because you were there with me.&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot;

&quot;Anyway, you might want to go get changed. We still have a competition 
to do right? So let&#39;s do our best.&quot;

&quot;...Yeah.&quot;

Without turning around I knew Mina was smiling. But I wondered if she 
could see the smile playing on my own face?

I&#39;m back...
