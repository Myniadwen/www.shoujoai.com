<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 14 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>It&#146;s been another three weeks since that day in Phoenix Palace on 
Mars. Now the Senshi were running around like mad. Terri and Hotaru 
were busy designing the dresses and tuxedos for them all. All 
positions had been decided. Serena was Rei&#146;s best &#145;man&#146; and Hotaru is 
Terri&#146;s maid of honor. Mina would be the flower girl. Lita and Amara 
would lead Ami and Michelle up the ail and stand next to Rei as 
grooms&#146;men&#146;. Vice versa with Ami and Michelle. Then Setsuna would lead 
Terri to the alter, Hotaru bringing up the rear holding her &#145;sisters&#146; 
train. 

Before any of this could even be practiced, many things had to be 
done. The chapel in the Crystal Palace was being decorated by Serena. 
Rei and Mina were planning the reception. Amara and Michelle were 
ordering flowers, linens, and silverware. Lita was busy with catering. 
Ami and Setsuna were arranging the honeymoon and inviting everyone, 
placing them where they should be. Of course Hotaru and Terri were 
designing. Hopefully everything would be done in the month they had. 

Hotaru looked up from her sketches to the woman at the other desk. The 
person she called her sister was working diligently on the tuxedos. 
Since Hotaru was still learning she got the dresses. Terri had said it 
would be good practice for her and that the tuxedos had to fit 
perfectly. Hotaru would need more experience. The bright part was, she 
got to make the wedding gown.

The Saturn Princess looked at Terri again, taking in her dazzling 
features. Queen Terrestria, Universal Destiny, leader of the Outers, 
and half the heart of the team. The young woman had so many sides, as 
did the others, but somehow it was just different with her and Serena. 
Terri had changed since she had shown up that night two years ago. 
Hotaru had known then that this girl would forever be a part of them. 
Her beauty was never ending. Terri&#146;s now white hair had once hung to 
just the middle of her back. Now it was to her perfect bottom. 
Shimmering with those random silver strands among her pure white hair. 
The long strips of chestnut went along with the rest. Framing her tan, 
smooth face. The Queen&#146;s eyes were navy - silver pools surrounded by 
her long dark lashes. She was slim, with long shapely legs and well 
muscled everywhere. They were silent muscles though, only showing that 
they were their. 

Terrestria understood war. She had be spilling the blood of her 
enemies much longer than the rest and with more skill. When she had 
arrived, she was full of mysteries and secrets. Her disposition was 
sweet and caring. A genius of Ami&#146;s standards and innocent. Terri was 
amazing and they all new. Like Serena was. Both were what the Universe 
had to have. And they way for Rei too live like she had used too. 
Before the last fight with Galaxia. Hotaru heard her name being called 
and she came out of her trance. 

&#147; Hotaru?!&#148; Terri looked flustered.

&#147; I&#146;m sorry Terri. Yes?&#148; 

&#147; I&#146;m gonna go get Serena. If I don&#146;t she&#146;ll forget and I need her 
measurements. Anything you want?&#148;

&#147; Lots of food please. You know Sere will be hungry.&#148; Terri giggled as 
she went out of the study.

&#147; Don&#146;t you know it!&#148; Hotaru grinned.

- She was our destiny. Her and Serena, and I am not complaining.-

A/N: I don&#146;t like that chapter too much. Too much sentimental stuff in 
it. But I wrote so oh well. I&#146;ll just have to put up the WEDDING 
chapter&#133;or maybe not&#133;I don&#146;t yet.</pre>
