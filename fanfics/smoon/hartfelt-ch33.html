<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch32.html">Back to Part 32</a><p><u>(Venus, Cupid Palace, Minako)</u></p><p>Sometime later in the day, Minako returned to 
her mother’s room. The woman slipped through the door, closing it softly behind her, and 
proceeded over to the bed. She peered at it for a moment, recalling when she had laid here 
in recovery after the incident; the memory saddened her, but at the same time it made her 
happy to know that everyone came for her.</p><p>Minako climbed onto the bed and fell down 
onto the sheets, inhaling deeply, and sighed happily. She was sore and exhausted from her 
work earlier that day, but she never felt more content. Minako lay there for a few minutes, 
feeling herself about to drift off to sleep until she snuggled further into the sheets and 
realized that there was something was hidden beneath the blanket.</p><p><i>Hm? </i>She swore 
that her foot hit something. <i>What’s that?</i></p><p>Minako reached over and pulled a 
fistful of blankets away to see a sheathed sword. There was a note on 
it.</p><p>“<i>Minako.”</i></p><p>She stared at the sword in confusion. <i>Is this for 
me?</i> A knock came at the door and she rushed to hide the weapon again in 
surprise.</p><p><i><b>Knock, knock.</b></i></p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Lady Minako? It’s Taya. May 
I come in?”</p><p><i>Oh. </i>“Yes, of course!”</p><p>A smile lit Minako’s face as the woman 
entered the room. Despite her fatigue, she couldn’t resist getting up and giving her friend 
a big hug.</p><p>“I missed you!” She laughed as they briefly embraced. “And wow...you 
look...uhh...”</p><p>Taya arched an eyebrow at that. “Old? I wouldn’t finish that if I were 
you, young Miss.”</p><p>“Hah, I was going to say tired, but okay. That works too! Hey. Don’t 
look at me like that, you did that yourself.”</p><p>Taya placed her hands on her hips and 
shot the girl a reproachful look. Minako briefly glanced down at the clipboard in one of her 
hands and noticed that it happened to be stuffed to the brim with papers. She was almost as 
bad as Luna.</p><p>“C’mon...turn that smile upside down.” Minako grinned and 
gestured.</p><p>She couldn’t help it. What had meant to be a smile came out like a 
half-snort. “...That was terrible. You got it all wrong.”</p><p>“Nope! I got it right. You 
smiled.” She winked.</p><p>Taya couldn’t fight that logic. “In any case, it is good to see 
you again My Lady. I would have come sooner, but I was tied up in a meeting.</p><p>“...Yeah? 
I think Sapphro mentioned something about it earlier.”</p><p>“Did he now?”</p><p>“Mhmm. But 
he never actually said what it was about. From the sounds of it... a lot has happened while 
I was away.”</p><p>“...You...could say that.” Taya frowned. She caught the mischievous look 
on Minako’s face and before she could open her mouth, she quipped, “Please try to be 
serious, My Lady. This is no laughing matter.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I couldn’t help it... So, 
what were you about to say?” Her excitement died away when she saw the serious expression. 
“Did...something bad happen?”</p><p>“...Perhaps. Lady Minako?” She was surprised when Minako 
suddenly grasped her hands and led her over to the bed where she sat them both 
down.</p><p>“I'm sorry... It’s just, you really do look tired. I thought you might feel 
better if you sat down.”</p><p>“But, this is Her Majesty’s...”</p><p>“It’s fine. Trust me.” 
The words seemed to have their desired effect because the tactician appeared to calm down a 
little. “Taya...before I say anything else, I just want you to know that I appreciate 
everything that you’ve done for me. Not just for back then, but for now as well. Believe 
me...even while I was gone, I felt really guilty for leaving you with all of this. You’re 
all worn out on my account. But I’m here now. I want you to know that I am taking you 
seriously, and that I’ll listen to anything you want to say. You’re my friend... So, 
please...tell me everything that’s happened while I was away. I need to know.”</p><p>Taya 
appeared to be somewhat hesitant still, but the look of determination in her charge’s eyes 
made her stare in wonder. It had happened again.</p><p><i>She’s changed 
again...</i></p><p>“All right,” she finally said. “To be honest, the reason that I was late 
was not because of the morning meeting. It was the second one.”</p><p>It took a moment for 
Minako to realize what she had said. “You mean you went to two meetings today?”</p><p>When 
her friend met her eye, Minako suddenly felt like she was being put on the spot. She signed 
in relief when the woman turned her piercing gaze away.</p><p>“Yes. You see… after you left, 
the people eventually found out about Her Majesty and Lord Eleutherios’s fate. They 
immediately took to the streets and began to riot. It took almost every able-bodied man we 
had to calm them down. I had intended to keep the news withdrawn from the public until you 
had returned home, however...it appears that privacy can be difficult when you have so many 
palace staff.” Minako could detect some annoyance in her voice, but she didn’t press it. “As 
a result, the number of injured increased significantly, and its putting an even greater 
strain on our system. To put it simply...Venus was never properly equipped for war. There 
were so many injured during the battle, and now this! The meeting this morning was called to 
address our shortage of medical supplies.”</p><p>“Oh.” <i>Should I tell her that it isn’t a 
problem anymore? But if I do, she’ll know that I wandered off again.</i> Already Minako 
could hear her guardian launching off into another 
lecture.</p><p><i>Maybe-I-should-just-stay-quiet-after-all.</i></p><p>“If that wasn’t bad 
enough,” Taya continued, “sometime during the meeting a messenger barged in screaming his 
head off that there was a strange being within the Capital. My first inclination was to 
think that we were being attacked, but apparently that wasn’t the case. He claimed that a 
saviour or an ‘angel’ had descended upon us. When I confronted him on the topic, he 
described her as a woman bathed in a golden light, that she was performing miracles, curing 
the sick and the injured without asking for anything in return.”</p><p>Minako gulped. <i>An 
‘angel’? C’mon, isn’t that going a bit too far?</i></p><p>“Umm...Sounds interesting?” She 
warily eyed the tactician as stood up and began to pace around in front of 
her.</p><p>“Indeed. I’ll let you know that the incident has created quite the ruckus. Even 
as I speak, there is practically a mob outside the palace gates. When I inquired a guard 
about the disturbance he said that the people were demanding to see the ‘captain’. 
Apparently, the citizens claim that this individual was a commanding officer of our military 
ranks, but they had no other name to go by. If you can believe it, they are calling for this 
‘captain’ person to become the next ruler.”</p><p>Taya stopped pacing, adjusted her glasses, 
and stared Minako directly in the eye.</p><p>“Can you explain this to 
me…Captain?”</p><p>Minako went pale, and braced herself for the lecture. But when it didn’t 
come, she realized that Taya was serious.</p><p>“W-Well... I was just waiting for you, but 
then someone said they needed my help... And then, it just kind of snowballed from there. I 
didn’t mean to cause more trouble for you...I’m sorry.”</p><p>Taya’s eyes softened and she 
sighed. “I know you meant well, but this does complicate the situation for you. The people 
now believe that they are asking someone other than their rightful ruler to ascend to the 
throne. If we tell them the truth, there is the small chance that it may create some 
resentment despite what you’ve done for them. On the other hand, if you present yourself as 
the captain, you will forever lose an important piece of your identity. And, on top of 
that...this forces your official appearance to happen quicker than I had 
anticipated.”</p><p>“Taya...” The regret in her friend’s voice made Minako’s heart 
ache.</p><p>“Why did you come back?” She heard her former student gasp behind her, and 
slowly turned around to face her. “If you had wanted it, you could have disappeared forever. 
You could have cut your ties to Venus, and gone wherever you pleased. You could have lived a 
normal life.”</p><p><i>What are you saying?</i></p><p>“The people would never have found 
out. We could have told them that the entire royal family had perished that 
day.”</p><p>“Wait, I don’t understand. You mean, you would have lied to them for me? But 
why?”</p><p>In the background, a faint sound of noises could be heard in the 
distance.</p><p>“Lady Minako... If you wish to, it’s still not too late. You can still turn 
back.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You don’t have to become the new ruler if you don’t want to. It 
won’t change the fact that you’re a Goddess, but at the very least you can live life the way 
you want.”</p><p><i>...Taya...</i> The woman’s word reminded her of the first time she had 
met Rei and the others.</p><p>Minako shook her head. “No. I didn’t come back here just to 
run away again!”</p><p>“My Lady--”</p><p>“Taya--you knew ever since the incident... that 
this would have to happen someday. So why are you trying so hard to stop me 
now?”</p><p>“...Because you’re my friend.” She said sharply, and silenced her. “It’s true. I 
was well aware that this day may come the moment I laid eyes on you after Her Majesty’s 
death.” In the woman’s vision, she could see a strong, golden aura around the Goddess. “You 
may already be aware of this, but Her Majesty’s power resides within you. No matter what 
anyone says, youare the rightful heir.”</p><p>Minako felt her heart skip a beat. “But 
Eros...”</p><p>“Lady Minako. Please come here. There is something that you need to see...” 
Taya beckoned the young woman to the window. When she pulled aside the curtains, the 
entrance of the courtyard could be seen in clear sight. Minako felt her eyes go wide and her 
breath, quicken. At the palace gate there was a large crowd of people that spread across the 
hill the palace was built upon. Was the entire city here?</p><p>Her guardian had anticipated 
Minako’s reaction, and felt partially overwhelmed herself by the situation.</p><p>“Do you 
see them?” She asked her. “They are all here because of you, regardless of who you presented 
yourself to be. Your Mother, Lady Aphrodite...also chose you.”</p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb</b></i></p><p>Suddenly, Minako looked vulnerable. There was a hint of uncertainty at 
what was to come.</p><p>“Do you understand, My Lady? Although it’s true that Lord 
Eleutherios was the intended heir, this is the reality of things. If you choose to ascend to 
the throne, you will be required to address them. Also, you would be expected to put their 
needs ahead of yours from this point on. In my personal opinion...I think it would be a 
terrible, heavy burden to put on your shoulders since you are still very 
young.”</p><p><i>Even for someone such as Lord Eleutherios, this would 
be...</i></p><p>“However... I would like to make it clear that this is your choice and yours 
alone. Whether you decide to become their ruler, or walk away from this... Regardless of 
what your choice will be, you will continue to have my full support.”</p><p>“Taya...” Minako 
was at a loss for words. For a moment, she thought she was going to cry. “I--I really don’t 
know what to say.”</p><p>Taya smiled back. “You don’t have to say anything. For now, I would 
find a quiet place and just think things over until you are ready.”</p><p>“But, what about 
them?”</p><p>They both turned their gazes back to the crowd. The guards in front of the gate 
were starting to have trouble keeping them calm.</p><p>“I will go out and meet with 
them.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“As the substitute ruler, it is my duty to address the people’s 
concerns. But please don’t worry... I will only ask that they be patient and wait until you 
have made your decision. If they are truly serious about wanting you to become their leader, 
then they will wait, even if only for a little bit. I’m afraid this is all I can do for you 
at the moment.”</p><p>“No. Don’t apologize.” Minako surprised her friend and gave her 
another hug. “This is more than enough. Thank you.”</p><p>“...It’s no trouble at 
all.”</p><p><i>When you’ve made your decision, come to the Audience 
Chamber.</i></p><p>Minako watched Taya leave and reappear down in the courtyard below to 
quell the masses. She had to admit that Taya was right; after seeing so many people at once, 
it had startled her terribly. She needed a quiet place to think, and she just knew where to 
go.</p><p>Minako past the bed and picked up her communicator. As she was about to leave, she 
suddenly remembered the sword she had hidden under the bed covers. Without really thinking 
about it, she picked that up as well before she left the room.</p><p><u>(Palace 
Garden)</u></p><p>Minako had eventually found herself in front of the royal gardens once 
again. It was in considerably worse shape than when she had seen it last. Some of the walls 
that held a few of the flowers beds had collapsed, spilling flowers and roots alike on the 
brick pathways, and a few of the pathways had been ripped out altogether. The flowers in the 
plots that appeared to be relatively unscathed were largely trampled—it was as though a 
child and a group of his friends had stomped around on them, but Minako knew better; this 
place was like the others. Nothing had been left untouched by the war.</p><p>The woman 
eventually made her way to the far end, preparing herself for what she may see, but sighed 
in deep relief to find that her sister’s plot was still intact.</p><p>“Whew...They’re all 
right.” She smiled. It was one thing less to worry about.</p><p>Minako sat herself down on a 
patch of dirt, right where a row of plots used to be. She knew her friend had told her to 
sit down and think, but now that she was trying to think nothing was quite coming to 
mind.</p><p><i>This would be easier if I had someone to talk to. </i>Rei’s face instantly 
came to mind. Minako took out her communicator and stared at the machine for a moment. 
<i>Well, she diiiiiid say that I could call. And if she’s busy, she just won’t pick 
up.</i></p><p>Minako inputted the channel, and watched the screen light 
up.</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>Channel secured… opening 
transmission…</b></i></p><p><i><b>Bleep!</b></i></p><p>Minako was momentarily surprised when 
Rei’s projection showed up. But she was even more surprised because the woman appeared to be 
in a strangely good mood.</p><p>“Hey. Well, this is a bit of a surprise. I didn’t expect you 
to call. Did something happen?” She heard Rei ask. In the background, she could hear 
distinct shouting.</p><p>“Umm...Well, kind of...But, before we get to that, what’s that in 
the background?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Correct me if I’m wrong but...is someone is 
screaming?”</p><p>She saw Rei smirk. That was never a good sign. “I don’t know what you’re 
talking about.” For an instant, Minako could have sworn that she saw the Martian’s first 
officer fly through the background. Was there something chasing him?</p><p>“Is that 
Zen?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Rei turned her head for a moment, but then shrugged. “He and Nozomi are 
just playing, so it’s nothing to worry about. Anyway,” she turned her attention back to the 
blonde, “what did you want to talk about?”</p><p>“Oh, well...You know. I was just wondering 
how you were doing.”</p><p>“Oh. Well, as you can see, everything is going well.”</p><p>“You 
mean it worked out okay?”</p><p>“Mhm. It’s just like I told you. It wasn’t a problem at 
all.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>It felt like someone had burst her bubble; Minako thought she 
should be happier for the woman, but now she felt like she was falling behind. Out of their 
group of friends, she figured she was holding them back.</p><p>Rei seemed to notice the 
suddenly dip in the blonde’s attitude. “Why? How are things going with you?”</p><p>There was 
a silence on Minako’s end as she racked her brains for the best way to explain things. In 
the end, she just gave up.</p><p>“Not so good.” She finally admitted.</p><p>“What? What do 
you mean? Nothing bad happened did it?”</p><p>“No. Not exactly,” Minako assured her. “I’m 
not really sure I would call it bad. It’s just...I did something, and now everyone wants me 
to be the ruler.”</p><p>“Okay? I won’t ask you what you did but...what’s the problem then? 
Are you starting to have second thoughts about this?”</p><p>Minako absent-mindedly picked up 
the sword she had brought with her and leaned it against her shoulder. Rei eyed the weapon 
with mild interest and then looked back to Minako. She was clearly distracted by something 
but the Martian didn’t know what.</p><p>“So, where did you get the sword? I thought you were 
just going to use your chains in battle from now on.”</p><p>“Hm? Well, I do. It’s 
just...It’s kind of a long story. I just feel comfortable when I hold it, that’s 
all.”</p><p>Rei seemed to nod her head in understanding. “I suppose I can understand 
that.”</p><p>Minako tapped the sword for a moment and looked at the seedlings before her. 
“Hey. You know how I had a lot of siblings right?”</p><p>“...Yeah.” Rei wasn’t sure where 
this was going, but she decided to play along anyway.</p><p>“Aside from Eros, there was one 
other person that I was remotely close to. I had an older sister named Marie. When we were 
younger, we would pass the time by planting flowers. They’re right there. See?”</p><p>Rei 
shot her a look.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“It’s a one way projection Mina. Unless you turn your 
communicator around then I can’t...”</p><p>“Oh! Sorry.” She laughed at herself and turned 
the machine around. “There, do you see them now? They’re right over there.”</p><p>“You mean 
those seedlings? Yeah, but it doesn’t look like they’ve quite grown yet.”</p><p>“Yeah,” she 
nodded. “They’re what we’d call, ‘late bloomers’. That’s because they’re always bloom later 
than the others. In any case, I was in the city today and it got me thinking about my 
sister. You know...she died on the battlefield, just like Eros.”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“When I 
thought about it, it got me thinking about the war again. Like, how many people are going to 
lose their lives when we fight? Do we really have any chance of winning?”</p><p>“I don’t 
know.” Rei replied. “But I do know that if we don’t fight back, our enemy won’t stop until 
he gets what he wants. When you look at it, we really don’t have much of a choice in the 
matter.”</p><p><i>We don’t have a choice? </i>She thought back to Taya’s words. <i>That’s 
right...Even if I ran away now, nothing would get better. Ares and Apollo would just hunt 
all of us down, no matter where we go. </i></p><p>The knowledge seemed to limit her choices 
to just one, but somehow it gave little comfort.</p><p>“Even if we don’t have a choice in 
the matter, doesn’t it make you even a little nervous? You’re responsible for everyone’s 
lives and, what if you make a mistake? Setsuna wants us all to become rulers so that we can 
strengthen our forces but even after the war is over we’ll still be the rulers. It just 
doesn’t end there.”</p><p>“That’s right.” Rei said. The confidence in her voice startled 
Minako. “When you become the leader of a people you can’t just go back and forth whenever 
you feel like it. It’s a lifelong commitment.”</p><p>“It almost sound like marriage,” the 
blonde chuckled.</p><p>“I’m serious!”</p><p>“I know. I know...I’m listening. It’s just, I 
know it’s obvious and I know what I need to do, but the idea of speaking in front of so many 
people all at once is kind of nerve wracking.”</p><p>“Oh, so you have to give a 
speech?”</p><p>“Kinda.” Minako sighed. “Hey, can I ask you something Rei?”</p><p>“What is 
it?”</p><p>“If I didn’t become queen, would you hate me?”</p><p>There was a long silence. 
Minako was afraid to see how the woman would react, so she looked away at first, but when 
she finally looked back she could see a deep, contemplative look on the Martian’s 
face.</p><p>“I don’t think it would be a matter of liking or hating at that point.” Rei 
finally said. “I mean, there are many ways at looking at it. If you don’t become the ruler, 
then someone else will but there’s no guarantee that the person will qualified to fill the 
role. Also, aside from the obvious fact that Venus may not join our fight against Apollo, 
would you really be happy with yourself?”</p><p><i>Huh?</i></p><p>“After fighting with us 
all this way, would you really be satisfied with walking away from everything now? Besides, 
for what it’s worth...I think you’d make a great ruler.”</p><p>“Really? You aren’t just 
saying that because of what I said before, are you?”</p><p>“I don’t say things that I don’t 
mean.” Rei retorted. “But why are <i>you </i>surprised? Do you really have that little 
confidence in yourself? Really Mina, I swear! If it’s not one thing it’s another with you! 
Before, you used to worry about becoming stronger, and now you’re stronger aren’t you? 
You’re strong enough to protect anybody you want to.” Her gaze then softened. “But... just 
because a person is strong, it doesn’t mean that they would be a good ruler. You have to 
care about your people, and I know you do. I’ve seen you shed tears and worry yourself sick 
over this. If you really, and I mean <i>really </i>feel that you won’t be a good leader, 
then that’s your choice. But I’d still tell you that you’re wrong.”</p><p><i>I believe in 
you.</i></p><p>Rei was surprised when Minako started laughing out loud. “W-What so 
funny?”</p><p>“It’s nothing. Really...” The woman wiped away the tears from her eyes, and 
sniffed. Somehow, Rei looked skeptical. “Well, it’s just...you’re really blunt, aren’t 
you?”</p><p><i>You’re the only one who scolded me for even thinking about running away. In a 
way, my shoulders feel almost lighter somehow.</i></p><p>“It’s no wonder I fell in love with 
you.” She saw Rei turn a deep shade of crimson.</p><p>“A-Anyway... Is that all you wanted to 
talk about?”</p><p>“...Yeah. Oh, actually, there was one other 
thing.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“These flowers... I don’t think they’ll bloom before we go and 
fight.” Behind her, the wind began to shift. “When everything is over...Would you come and 
watch them with 
me?”</p><p><i><b>...fwooooOOOOoooosssh...</b></i></p><p>“...Sure.”</p><p>“You 
promise?”</p><p>“Promise.”</p><p>After she turned off her communicator, Minako stood up with 
the sword in her hand. She spared one last glance at the samplings before she finally turned 
around and headed back towards the palace.</p><p><i>I’ve made my decision.</i></p><p><u> 
(Cupid Palace)</u></p><p>Minako marched back into the palace and began to make her way 
towards the Audience Chamber. Somewhere along the way, she heard the beginnings of 
voices.</p><p>The Venusian made it to the doors of the Audience Chamber when she ran across 
Sapphro. The man had been standing there as if he had been waiting for 
someone.</p><p>“Minako!” He greeted her.</p><p>“Sapphro? What are you doing here? Where’s 
Taya?”</p><p>“Ah, well, she’s a bit busy at the moment, so she asked me to wait here for 
you. Anyway! I guess if you’re here, that must mean that you’ve made a decision. So 
kiddo...? Lay it on me. What do you plan to do?”</p><p>She steadily met his eyes. “I’ll 
succeed my mother and become the new ruler!”</p><p>Sapphro just smiled at that. “Yeah, I 
kinda figured as much. Anyway! Taya is waiting up ahead... We’re all waiting for you,” he 
winked and then began to lead the way.</p><p>For a moment, Minako just gaped at him. <i>That 
jerk! You can at least pretend to act surprised! </i>She almost wanted to ambush him from 
behind but that wouldn’t be a very Goddess-like thing to do, would it?</p><p>The two changed 
course and continued to climb higher and higher into the palace, while the entire time the 
shouts became louder.</p><p>Halfway up their climb, Sapphro kept shooting glances over at 
the woman. Eventually, he said,</p><p>“So, I guess you received it without a 
problem.”</p><p>“Huh?” Mianko looked up. She then followed his gaze to the sword. “Oh, you 
mean this? I found it on Mother’s bed. Were you...the one who left it for 
me?”</p><p>“...Maybe.”</p><p>“But why...? You know, I don’t need a sword to fight anymore. 
My powers are a lot stronger than they used to be.”</p><p>They both came to a 
stop.</p><p>“...Sapphro?”</p><p>“That’s true. Since you inherited your mother’s powers, you 
are stronger. But...I didn’t give you that sword because I thought you needed one to fight. 
I gave it to you because I thought you needed <i>that </i>sword.”</p><p>“I’m afraid I don’t 
quite follow...”</p><p>“Look at the hilt. Do you see anything on it?”</p><p>“Umm...Well, not 
really...” Minako furrowed her brow in confusion. <i>Is there something I’m supposed to be 
looking for specifically? </i>As she analyzed it, she noticed Venus’s insignia engraved on 
it but then again she saw that everywhere. Finally, she gave up. “I give up Sapphro. What 
are you talking about?”</p><p>“You mean you didn’t see your planet’s insignia?” Sapphro’s 
blue eyes twinkled when he saw the look of surprise on her face.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>He 
couldn’t help but laugh at that. “You’re probably thinking ‘so what’, right? Well, I guess 
that’s normal, considering that you grew up around the palace. A planet’s insignia is like a 
royal crest. You’re probably used to seeing it, but most people aren’t. So, since it’s on 
that sword, that must mean...”</p><p>Minako fell silent. <i>It can’t be.</i></p><p>“Have you 
figured it out?” He calmly asked.</p><p>“You don’t mean...that it belonged to Eros, do 
you?”</p><p>“That’s right. It was your brother’s sword. I wasn’t able to do anything for 
him, but...if he were here, right now... I think he would like you to have 
it.”</p><p>“...Thank you.” She smiled. “It means a lot to me.”</p><p>Sapphro nodded back and 
they continued along their way. It wasn’t long before they reached the top floor. In the 
highest corridor of the palace, there was a small doorway at its middle. A set of red 
curtains draped to either side of the circular archway, acting as an entrance to a narrow, 
dimly lit tunnel inside. It wasn’t particularly long; they could already see the end from 
the entrance. Sapphro and Minako walked through the space and walked straight into small but 
brightly lit room. It appeared to be connected to a balcony in the very front. As Sapphro 
had promised, Taya was waiting there for them. Since the last time Minako had seen her, the 
woman appeared to have aged a few years in a matter of hours.</p><p>“Hey Taya! Been waiting 
long?” Sapphro shouted over to her. As she turned around and began to reprimand him, 
Minako’s ears perked up. The voices were the loudest up here. As she listened, she could 
clearly make out the word ‘captain’ amidst the shouts.</p><p>“...Captain! Bring out the 
Captain!”</p><p><i>Are they really calling for me? </i>Minako was getting butterflies in her 
stomach just thinking about it.</p><p>“Lady Minako…” Taya approached her. There was a very 
serious expression on her face. “Have you made your decision? Sapphro didn’t force you to 
come here, did he?”</p><p>“No, he didn’t. I chose to come here on my own accord.”</p><p>“I 
see. So then, that means...” He voice was suddenly cut off when loud shouts could be heard 
in the corridor outside. A handful of the elite guards within the room exchanged glances and 
then ran out to see what the disturbance was about.</p><p>“Please let me through! I need to 
speak with the Captain!” A familiar voice pleaded.</p><p>Minako’s eyes widened. <i>That 
couldn’t be, could it?! </i>She remembered the trio of guards she had met with earlier. 
There was only one person who was that persistent.</p><p>“Minako!”</p><p>Minako ran outside 
into the corridor and turned her head towards the good of guards. “Captain!” Approximately 
halfway down the hallway, she spotted Render and his two friends being barred by a line of 
the elite guard. The young man stood on his tip-toes to try and get a better look at the 
Goddess, but one of the guards promptly shoved him back.</p><p>“Oof!”</p><p>“Render! Are you 
all right?” Ernest caught him.</p><p>“Y-Yeah...I’m fine. Thanks.”</p><p>“I strongly advise 
that the three of you leave now,” the head guard said sternly at a distance away. “If you 
continue to persist, then you will be punished!”</p><p>“No! I swear I’m telling the truth! I 
know the Captain!”</p><p>“Just like the rest of the mob outside, I’m sure!” He retorted. “Do 
not let them pass!”</p><p>“Wait!” Render bit back when he saw the line of soldiers took the 
neutral stance. If they even took one step forward, he was sure they would draw their swords 
on them in an instant.</p><p><i>I don’t understand! Why is the elite guard here with the 
Captain? Aren’t they supposed to be loyal to the royal family?! </i></p><p>Render drew down 
into a squat as the rest of his teammates also prepared themselves. It looked like a fight 
was about to ensue when someone shouted,</p><p>“Stop! Don’t hurt them!” Minako commanded the 
men. The head of the elite guard looked shocked.</p><p>“What?! But—with all due respect, 
they could be rogue soldiers!”</p><p>“It’s all right. I will see him. Let him and his men 
through!”</p><p>The head guard didn’t appear too pleased with the order, but he followed it 
nonetheless. With a gesture of his hand, his troops obediently parted to the sides. Squad 
RED didn’t waste any time. The trio ran up to the Goddess and dropped to one 
knee.</p><p>“Our thanks to you, Captain!” Render bellowed out. Behind Minako, Taya and 
Sapphro were shooting curious glances at the three soldiers while their comrades shot them 
looks of disdain.</p><p>“Do you know them?” Taya inquired the to-be ruler.</p><p>“Yes, they 
were a part of the squad that I commanded during the invasion. Also, I’ve met with them 
earlier today. When I went to the city they acted as my escorts.” She returned her attention 
to the soldiers and noted the beads of sweat forming on their leader’s face. “Render. Why 
have you come here?”</p><p>“Before I say anything, Sir, I would like to offer you my thanks 
again on behalf of the people you helped today! ...And...For what you did for my 
grandmother, you also have my personal thanks.” Minako patiently waited until he gathered 
enough breath to continue. “But there is something that I need to ask you... The people 
outside are clamouring for you to take up the throne as our new leader. Will you do it? Will 
you accept the position?!”</p><p>Minako blinked. “You came all the way here just to ask me 
that?” That was when a thought hit her. “Why is it so important to you? What would you do if 
I did accept the position?”</p><p>“If… If you did…” He bit his bottom lip. Despite his armor 
Minako could see that he was trembling from some internal conflict. “With all due respect 
Sir, I believe that I speak for my squad when I say that we believe you are more than 
qualified for the position. You truly care about our people, and have come to our aid when 
we were at a loss... more than once in fact… However! While we joined the military to 
protect our homes, didn’t we also swear an oath to protect the royal family as well? By 
taking up the position of ruler now, even though there is a chance that the true successor 
is still out there... wouldn’t that be considered treason?!”</p><p>“Render.”</p><p>“We all 
swore an oath to Her Majesty, Aphrodite’s family! Therefore, Sir… If you should take the 
position now, I will not stop you. BUT!” As he said this, his voice shook. “But if the 
successor to the royal family is ever found… then I cannot guarantee that we will not clash 
in the near future. For this, I offer my apologies, Sir!”</p><p>Minako found herself 
speechless.</p><p><i>Wow. I really can’t believe it... Their dedication goes as far as this? 
</i>She noticed Ernest, the very man who had argued against searching for the heir also 
bowing in agreement. <i>Even if I wasn’t the appointed successor to the throne, if it was 
another person, they would still fight against their superiors for someone they’ve never 
met?</i></p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>Render’s head shot up. “Sir?”</p><p>“I commend your 
dedication. It’s admirable.” Minako smiled, and then walked back into the room.</p><p>“Wait! 
What do you mean--” He rose to his feet, but was stopped by a firm hand on his arm. Render 
gasped. “L-Lady Taya? But...why is the substitute ruler allowing this? Are you really okay 
with this?!”</p><p>The tactician’s eyes were trained on her charge now; the young Goddess 
was a mere step from leaving her cover, from making her appearance.</p><p>“Lady 
Taya?”</p><p>“If you are loyal to the former Queen’s family like you say you are, then I ask 
that you give the ‘captain’ a chance. Watch and listen carefully. You may even learn 
something.”</p><p>Minako stopped just outside of the balcony and swallowed hard. A steady 
stream light was beaming through the open doorway and the voices beyond it were louder than 
she last heard them. It seemed that the crowd was becoming restless. Behind her, she could 
also feel multitude of gazes intensely watching her back.</p><p>She was trembling 
inside.</p><p>“<i>Now, tell me... what’s the problem? What’s bothering my little sister?” 
</i></p><p>“… <i>I only met you, and I’m already making a fool of myself.”</i></p><p><i>No. 
That’s not it. The problem is... I’m 
scared...</i></p><p><i><b>fwoooOOOooossssh…</b></i></p><p>……………………<i>.……..Minako………….</i></p><p>She 
blinked when she felt a tug on her hand.</p><p><i>Huh? Is it just my imagination or... why 
does it feel like someone is holding my hand?</i></p><p>She didn’t know why, but Minako 
allowed herself to be pulled from the shadows and into the light where she was exposed for 
all to see. Instantly! The crowd erupted into enthusiastic cheers that were so loud that 
they were deafening.</p><p><i><b>RAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</b></i></p><p>The invisible force 
released the young woman’s hand, and Minako shakily gripped onto the balcony railing for 
support. It was a breathtaking sight, far different than what she had anticipated from the 
shadows. Out here, in the sunlight where the wind played with her golden hair, a realization 
hit her.</p><p><i>This must be how my Mother felt when she addressed her people… 
</i></p><p>…<i>From this same place…</i></p><p>…<i>Exactly like this…</i></p><p>From inside, 
the thin silhouette of a longhaired woman caught Render’s attention. He blinked and rubbed 
his eyes. In the instant he lost sight of it, it was gone.</p><p><i>T-That’s weird… for a 
moment, I thought I saw a shadow behind the captain…</i></p><p>Minako inhaled deeply, and 
then tilted her head upward towards the blue sky. Immediately she was filled with awe at its 
expansiveness; it stretched further than the crowd below her, over her entire planet. If one 
were up there, how far could one possibly see? Those who passed on from this life, from this 
world of sorrow and joy, were they watching now?</p><p><i>What would you tell me… if you 
were here, Marie?</i></p><p>The sun briefly flickered behind the clouds, and Minako raised 
her hand for silence.</p><p>“Everyone!” She tested her voice. “Everyone, please listen to 
me!”</p><p>The crowd hushed…</p><p>“My name… is Venus, Minako! I am the youngest child of 
the former Queen Aphrodite!”</p><p>Inside the castle beside Taya, Render nearly fell over in 
astonishment. The man wasn’t quite sure if he heard correctly.</p><p>“Y-You mean… She’s the 
survivor?!”</p><p><i>The captain was the remaining member of the royal family? She’s one 
we’ve been searching for all this time?</i></p><p>Taya turned to him and regarded him 
calmly.</p><p>“Young man… do you not find it odd how a person can heal as many as she did in 
such a short time span? Or the fact that she has the ability to heal at all?”</p><p>Render 
recalled back to earlier that day when his grandmother was made well. There actually had 
been something unusual that had caught his attention.</p><p>“I remember that there was a 
strange light…” He confessed. “I didn’t know what it was, but maybe, I just didn’t care. She 
was helping people, and that was all that mattered to me.”</p><p>“A Goddess can heal others 
at the expense of their own strength. What she did today was a very reckless thing to do, 
but… that is the type of person Lady Minako is.”</p><p>“Lady Minako...” The man repeated the 
name, the Goddess’s true name.</p><p><i>When we needed her she appeared out of nowhere to 
help us. Back then, it was our fault for not staying focused, for not remembering our duty. 
It was our fault for not realizing anything then…</i></p><p>His earlier worries disappeared 
and a sad relief flooded into his heart.</p><p><i>I’m glad. Even though we won’t be able to 
hang out together anymore, I’m glad that she’s the true successor...Truly. With all my 
heart! </i></p><p>“You know, I...I’ve always wanted to become part of the elite guard. A 
lowly soldier like myself isn’t permitted to be in the presence of the royal family...but... 
it was my hope that, someday, I would be able to speak with them and protect them 
personally. It was a dream of mine...”</p><p>“And you have.” He turned his head in surprise. 
“You have spoken with a member of the royal family quite a bit, or at least from what I have 
heard. You escorted My Lady to the city capital today, did you not?” She watched the youth 
weakly nod his head. “Although you did not know who she was, you still believed in her. That 
type of loyalty is rare, and is essential for our members of the elite guard.”</p><p>“Lady 
Taya, just what are you saying?”</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>“Please continue to protect My 
Lady... as you always have…”</p><p><i><b>Lubb dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>As part of the elite 
guard?</i></p><p>Tears blurred Render’s vision in overwhelming gratitude. Even Dael and 
Ernest were lost for words as they tried to support their friend. However, it was not over 
yet; Minako hadn’t finished yet.</p><p>“I’m sorry that I wasn’t there for all of you 
earlier. But I am here now, and there is something that I need to tell you.” She took a deep 
breath. “The enemy who attacked us, and killed the late Queen is still at large!”</p><p>A 
murmur flew through the crowd.</p><p>“I understand that many of you would rather not fight 
again, and I will not force you! But as long as we sit idly by and do nothing, then it’s 
guaranteed that there will be more unwanted battles! There will be more unnecessary deaths! 
That is why... I believe we should join forces with the other planets and fight back! 
Although I may not be worthy of your trust... please lend me your strength. If you won’t do 
it for a ruler, then do it for yourselves!”</p><p>Minako’s plea rang throughout the area, 
echoing against the walls and back faintly to her ears. Her hands pressed against the 
balcony’s railing, barely keeping a grip on the slippery, marble surface as she silently 
pleaded with her people; she had said everything she could say, and now she waited for their 
answer.</p><p>A faint humming caught in the woman’s ears first, quickly followed by quick 
movements below. While she waited for the possible rejection, she registered another 
familiar 
sound.</p><p>…<i>Clapping…?</i></p><p><i><b>RAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</b></i></p><p>Inside, Render 
weakly lifted his head and smiled at the Goddess’s surprised expression.</p><p><i>What’s 
that face for? Even if you were gone for a long time, you still came back to us. You helped 
us when we needed you... That’s all that matters.</i></p><p>Minako’s knees went weak upon 
hearing their response. She was so happy that she wasn’t sure if she should laugh or 
cry.</p><p><i><b>Bleep! Bleep!</b></i></p><p>An insistent noise dragged the Venusian out of 
the clouds; Minako’s communicator was detecting multiple incoming calls. Without hesitation 
she simultaneously opened all channels. In a blink of an eye, all around the balcony from 
where she stood, six different projection windows popped up and within each of those panels 
they depicted the other planet rulers also addressing their people. Haruka, Michiru, Ami, 
Makoto, Usagi and Hotaru (with a strange man she’d never seen before in the background), 
and, lastly, Rei made their appearance.</p><p>She couldn’t resist smiling.</p><p>There was 
another re-adjustment of the transmission panels before the representative rulers were 
specifically focused on. Meanwhile, the citizens on all of the planets were left taken aback 
from seeing so many high ranking individuals gathered at once. As a result, the same 
questions were being asked among the different cultures.</p><p>“Those are the rulers 
right?”</p><p>“I recognize a few, but I don’t recognize Mars’s. Wasn’t their ruler Ares? 
What’s a woman doing there?”</p><p>“Wait… I think I heard something about them having a 
substitute ruler…”</p><p>“Never mind Mars! It looks like Earth is getting involved as 
well.”</p><p>“Earth, Mercury, Neptune… I’m actually surprised Venus is here too! But somehow 
I thought Aphrodite looked older.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s not her?”</p><p>“What’s going on 
here?!”</p><p>Haruka glanced down momentarily at her communicator, re-checking to make sure 
they were all present. Once she counted off the correct number of windows from her side, she 
nodded to herself.</p><p>“Then we are all here?” Her projection boomed and instantly all 
observers fell silent to witness this unusual meeting. “It appears that there is a much 
needed announcement!”</p><p>From where she stood Rei whole-heartedly wished she could shoot 
the wind ruler a glare, yet she resisted to uphold her diplomatic form.</p><p>“Yes, that is 
correct.” Rei’s window began to temporary zoom out to reveal the kneeling Martian soldiers 
behind her. They were numerous in their numbers.</p><p>“As many of you may already know, I 
was formerly the substitute leader of Mars in Ares’s place. However, there has been a change 
in command! From here on, I, Mars Rei, am the leader of Mars!”</p><p>Though statement 
prompted many whispers among all of the planets, none of the rulers seemed to mind; 
secretly, the majority of the women were already having a hard time as it is trying not to 
grin at their friend’s success.</p><p>“I see,” Uranus mused. “And I see there is also a new 
face representative for Venus as well…”</p><p>Minako glanced back at the people below her, 
reassuring herself of their decision. There were many grins and ‘go on’ type of gestures 
from both the crowd and her support group behind her. It took everything the new ruler had 
to suppress her excitement.</p><p>…<i>Everyone…</i></p><p>“Yes.” Minako replied in a serious 
tone. “Due to a few unforeseen circumstances there has also been a change in command for 
Venus. I, Venus Minako, am the new ruler of 
Venus!”</p><p><i><b>RAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</b></i></p><p><i>Thank you.</i></p><p>“It would also 
appear that we have one other unfamiliar face among us.” Michiru pointed out. All attention 
shifted towards Earth’s window.</p><p>King Endymion was zoomed upon.</p><p>“Please allow me 
to introduce myself. I am King Endymion of Earth.” He politely gestured. “Today I have not 
come to solely speak for myself, but on the behalf of both the people of Earth and the Moon. 
After speaking with the ruler of the Moon, we have come to an agreement to bridge our two 
societies together! As it now stands, Earth will remain as our center of command until 
re-settlement to the Moon is established.”</p><p>Haruka narrowed her eyes a little. 
<i>Getting all the help we can get, huh, Setsuna?</i></p><p>“Very well.” Haruka reluctantly 
accepted the fact. “Then we, the rulers of Uranus, Neptune, Mercury, and Jupiter hereby 
recognize Venus Minako, Mars Rei and King Endymion as the rulers of their respective 
planets!”</p><p>There was applause sounding in the background, especially on Venus. However, 
Uranus wasn’t about to stop until it was all over.</p><p>“We all have gathered here today to 
formally dissolve any previous alliances, and to swear a new allegiance under the Planetary 
Alliance! Together, it is our hope that we may finally gain peace!” She raised her 
hand.</p><p>“Therefore, as the ruler 
of--”</p><p>“Uranus--”</p><p>“Neptune--”</p><p>“Mercury--”</p><p>“Jupiter--”</p><p>“Earth--”</p><p>“Mars--”</p><p>“Venus--”</p><p>“--SWEAR 
ALLEGIANCE TO THE PLANETARY ALLIANCE!”</p><p><i><b>RAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!</b></i></p><p>As the 
people celebrated the new unification, Minako finally let her hand fall down to her side and 
basked in the joyful atmosphere-- finding herself pleasantly exhausted from all the 
excitement.</p><p><i>I was so afraid back then, that now I don’t even know what I had to be 
afraid about. Thinking back on it, it almost makes me feel silly.</i></p><p><i>Maybe… It’s 
just like Rei said. I just lacked confidence. I could believe and trust anyone but myself. 
But if I had never taken that first step to address my people, then none of this would have 
been possible. I would have never known…</i></p><p><i>But I’ve decided! No matter what the 
outcome is, I will have no regrets!</i></p><p>A gentle breeze blew up against the Goddess 
and sent her hair-flying back; the coolness against her flush face momentarily refreshed 
her. Yet the gift was not enough to entirely distract the woman from the light pressure 
squeezing against her hand. Minako’s eyes widened and her heart raced upon feeling the 
comforting gesture.</p><p>…It was familiar…</p><p>…All too familiar…</p><p>“<i>What would 
you tell me… if you were here, Marie?</i><i>”</i></p><p>“…You…” Tears stung her 
eyes.</p><p>“<i>There, there… The past is the past Minako dear… What happened is done. Why 
don’t we focus on the present?”</i></p><p>Minako gently squeezed back, finding the tears 
already falling. The final good-bye between loved ones-- to the one who rescued her, who 
showed her, her world and home. Every unspoken emotion was expressed within a single 
heartfelt gesture, to be forever cherished between two souls until the final distant 
reunion.</p><p>…<i>I’ll miss you…</i></p><p>Minako felt the breeze slowly pull away, the 
ghostly fingertips keeping contact right until the tips of their fingertips slipped apart. 
Her heart cried out but she knew that no matter how much she desired it, it was one wish 
that cannot be granted.</p><p>The memories that they shared, would always be filled with 
laughter and warm embraces. It was with that one consoling thought, that with a heavy heart, 
Minako was finally able let go, and watch as the breeze soared upwards towards the waiting 
blue sky.</p><p><i>You don’t have to worry anymore Marie…</i></p><p>…<i>From now 
on…</i></p><p>…………………<i>.…I think I’ll be okay…</i></p><p>“Good-bye…” She whispered. 
“…And…”</p><p>“…Thank you…”</p>
