<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 9 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>        The two made their way forward, an arrow ready in Rei&#39;s bow 
and Usagi carrying her sword in the guard position. The halls were 
almost eerily quiet, the normal bustle of the hospital completely 
gone. They reached the doors of the nursery, and Usagi gave Rei a 
questioning look.

        &quot;It&#39;s in there,&quot; Rei confirmed.

        Usagi took a centering breath, raised her katana, and then 
smiled grimly. She kicked out, slamming the swinging doors wide open 
as she rolled inside, her sword coming up in guard position as she 
cried, &quot;Get away from those kids!&quot;

        The silvery haired figure stood in front of the cradles, 
gathering up swirls of white light from the many little babies. He 
turned around, eyes widening slightly as he saw Usagi, Rei coming in 
right behind her, then he smiled wryly.

        &quot;I take it the five chose to let you pass,&quot; he said to them 
thoughtfully, &quot;they&#39;ll pay for that disloyalty later.&quot; He threw his 
arm back dramatically, the cape he wore over his shoulders 
swirling, &quot;I am Malachite, little princess.&quot;

        &quot;That will not get you on her good side,&quot; Rei tightened her 
grip on the arrow on the string as she continued, &quot;she hates being 
called that.&quot;

        Usagi tossed Rei a slight frown, then looked over at 
Malachite. &quot;Yield and live,&quot; she said crisply, &quot;fight me and die.&quot;

        Surprisingly Malachite laughed at them. &quot;You grow over-
confident,&quot; he murmured, &quot;but little rabbit, you have yet to face 
our warriors. And,&quot; he gestured, energy coursing between his hands 
to form a sword of pure light, &quot;you have never faced one like me.&quot;

        &quot;Big talk,&quot; Rei drew and released, the arrow hissing as it 
raced through the air towards him. With an completely inhuman speed 
he actually caught the arrow from midair, contemptuously tossing it 
aside to clatter to the floor.

        Usagi moved, katana a blur as he swept down at her, their 
weapons coming together in a flash of light. They gazed into each 
other&#39;s eyes, for a moment the two looking oddly... alike, both of 
their eyes alive with the passion of combat. A twist of Usagi&#39;s 
blade broke the clash, and the two fought back and forth in the room.

        Malachite was like poetry in motion, the smooth, wide arcs 
of his weapon clearly defining his territory. He leapt and almost 
danced, staying at least a step ahead of the powerful strokes of 
Usagi&#39;s blade. But his face was a study, moving from supreme self 
confidence, to surprise, worry, and finally a bit of fear in his 
oddly gray eyes.

        &quot;You&#39;re very good,&quot; Malachite finally had to concede as 
their weapons came together once again. The two of them stood there 
almost frozen, studying each other&#39;s faces intently, each ready to 
move in a moment&#39;s notice.

        &quot;And you think that you&#39;re in some kind of samurai drama,&quot; 
Rei said coldly, quite deliberately drilling Malachite in the back 
with an arrow.

        Malachite jerked in pain, his guard dropping for just a 
moment, but more than long enough for Usagi to sweep her blade right 
across his exposed belly. He staggered backward, desperately trying 
to hold his guts in with his arms, then his back exploded into 
flames as Rei&#39;s arrow finally ignited, light and fire driving him 
forward.

        Usagi swept her katana upwards, cutting him once again and 
finishing the youma off. As he fell the sphere of life energy broke 
up, swirling to return to the children, all of whom began to cry 
weakly as will and strength returned to them. The gray clad body 
began to dissolve, black ooze spreading out on the gleaming floor.

        &quot;We&#39;d better get out of here before any of the hospital 
staff free themselves from the youma&#39;s spell,&quot; Rei suggested, taking 
a step towards the doors.

        &quot;A very good idea,&quot; Usagi made a face, realizing that 
several diapers in the room probably needed changing. They hurried 
away down the hallway as dazed medical staff began to return to 
their duties, ignoring both young women.

        Rei looked over at Usagi as they hurried out of the 
hospital, realizing what was bothering her. Usagi had been enjoying 
herself when she fought Malachite, completely wrapped up in the 
dance of the sword duel. Now as they walked Usagi looked completely 
normal, but it had been a bit... unnerving, to see that look on the 
intense young woman&#39;s face.

        &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Rei finally asked softly.

        Usagi gave her an odd look, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot; She took the 
communicator Ami had given them and felt a bit relieved it was 
relatively simple. &quot;Ami, you there?&quot;

        The voice came through loud and clear, &quot;Of course, Usagi.&quot; A 
pause, &quot;We&#39;ve dealt with the youma at the amusement park. Makoto and 
I are currently heading for the shrine, and I assume we&#39;ll meet you 
there.&quot;

        &quot;The youma at the hospital&#39;s been dealt with,&quot; Usagi said 
calmly, &quot;and yes, we&#39;ll meet you there. Usagi, out.&quot;

        Rei chuckled softly, &quot;My grandfather gets to look at you 
three again, he&#39;ll be so happy.&quot;

        &quot;Oh, joy,&quot; Usagi smiled back, her blue eyes glinting.

        It wasn&#39;t long before the two were climbing the shrine steps 
together, feeling like two warriors triumphant in battle. They were 
almost through the gate when Rei reached out to stop Usagi, &quot;There&#39;s 
someone else up there.&quot;

        &quot;Lets go,&quot; Usagi drew her sword as the two ran up the final 
steps.

        Rei slid arrow to string, dropping down on one knee to ease 
her firing while Usagi remained standing, sword in hand. She didn&#39;t 
see anything, but she could feel whomever it was out there. &quot;Show 
yourself,&quot; Rei cried, closing her eyes and reaching out with her 
senses. The arrow almost released itself, soaring through the air...

        ... only to be caught by a white gloved hand. The girl&#39;s 
long blonde hair stretched out behind her like a banner, the skirt 
of her sailor fuku moving slightly in the wind. Her face was almost 
entirely shadowed, her eyes hidden by a simple white mask. On her 
shoulder, a familiar looking white cat crouched there, watching the 
four of them warily.

        &quot;Sailor V,&quot; Ami murmured, jumping to her feet with her cold 
gun in hand, Makoto rising beside her with fists clenched for battle.

        &quot;Very good,&quot; Sailor V nodded to Rei respectfully, casually 
tossing the arrow back to the girl, &quot;you&#39;re senses grow sharper.&quot;

        &quot;Blame that little cat of yours,&quot; Rei kept her voice nearly 
flat as she caught the arrow, &quot;he reminded me that I could be trying 
harder.&quot;

        Artemis shifted, becoming the form of a white haired young 
man. &quot;Luna,&quot; he smiled weakly, &quot;it&#39;s good to see you again.&quot;

        The little black cat stalked right by him as she walked from 
where Ami and Makoto were standing to leap up onto Usagi&#39;s shoulder. 
Her tail lashing she glared at the boy until he took an involuntary 
half-step backward.

        &quot;That&#39;s enough, Luna,&quot; Usagi murmured as she reached up to 
scratch the black cat behind the ears. She looked over at Sailor V, 
studying the masked woman intently before finally saying, &quot;I don&#39;t 
think we&#39;ve met.&quot;

        &quot;No, we haven&#39;t,&quot; Sailor V agreed, walking up to where Usagi 
and Rei stood. They stood a short distance, looking almost exactly 
alike as they gazed at each other. Finally a slight smile tugged at 
Sailor V&#39;s lips, &quot;You know, I think you&#39;ll do.&quot;

        Usagi blinked. &quot;Thank you, I think,&quot; she managed. She puffed 
a little breath out before saying, &quot;Could you please tell me what&#39;s 
going on?&quot;

        Sailor V shook her head no. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she gestured, and 
Artemis shifted back to his cat form, leaping up onto her 
shoulder, &quot;but you&#39;re not ready. Not yet.&quot;

        As the blonde moved off Makoto ran forward to shout, &quot;Wait a 
minute!&quot;

        The voice came back to them from the darkness, fading 
fast. &quot;When you need me, I&#39;ll be there. That I promise you.&quot;

        There was a long moment of silence as the four stood there 
before Rei growled out, &quot;Well that was irritating.&quot;

        &quot;She did that to us over at the amusement park too,&quot; Ami 
admitted, pushing her short blue hair back, &quot;but I didn&#39;t realize 
she followed us.&quot;

        &quot;You couldn&#39;t have known,&quot; Makoto said gruffly.

        &quot;Well,&quot; Usagi looked tired, &quot;at least we won for tonight.&quot; A 
grim little smile, &quot;There&#39;ll be other nights, but tonight is ours.&quot;
