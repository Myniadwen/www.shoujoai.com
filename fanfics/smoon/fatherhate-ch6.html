<p>Haruka felt a  sad frown come over her features as she felt the aura of sorrow that  radiated from the moon-hime, took in her dull blue eyes and the blank  expression on her face. Mamoru was there, his face also contorted in  pain, even though it was a fraction less than the blonde’s, but still,  it was obvious that the prince of Earth was feeling as bad as the rest  of the Senshi. There was a time, a very long time ago, when Rei and  Mamoru had dated, although it was only for a short time. During the few  days before the revelation that Usagi was the Serenity reincarnated,  Mamoru had bonded into a brother-sister relationship with the miko.  Things had been tense and awkward, but after a few weeks, that bond,  completely platonic of course, had come back. </p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a crushing blow, to all of them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako was curled up  in her Puu-chan’s arms, sniffling into the Senshi of Time’s slender  neck while the normally stoic woman murmured sweet nothings and rubbing  her back in small circles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hotaru was fast asleep in Michiru’s  embrace, a sad, worried frown on her angelic face. The little girl had  nearly fallen apart when the news that Rei could be dead had reached  the Outers home. Despite Michiru telling Hotaru that her healing  abilities need not be used, the Senshi of Death and Rebirth had done so  anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The room was silent, save Minako’s sniffles, and the steady ‘beep’ from the monitor that showed Rei’s heartbeat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usako,” Mamoru began, “Do you want me to drive you home or do you want to stay here?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi’s  silence was her answer. Mamoru smiled, absolutely in awe at Usagi’s  loyalty to her friend. He knew that Rei and Usagi were as close as  friends could be, even though he was nearly driven insane by their  constant bickering. He bent and pressed a kiss to her temple, sensing  that that was all she could take at this point. He bid a farewell to  the Senshi, getting soft good-byes in exchange. As he entered his car,  another friend entered his thoughts, making him smile bittersweetly. A  certain man with green skin and turquoise hair…</span></p>

“You mean,” Rei murmured. “If I move away from you…I’ll die?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s mother closed pained lavender eyes. “I’m afraid so Rei-chan.”  Rei frowned and hugged her knees to her chest. The miko found her  thoughts drifting towards a blonde princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will I…be able to go back?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you want to?” came the equally soft reply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What kind of question is that?” Rei snapped. She felt bad immediately after, and apologized. “Yes…” the Fire Senshi answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Even  if Usagi doesn’t feel the same?” Rei cringed. Biting her lip, she  looked at the lush, green grass as her mother awaited her answer. Rei  very much doubted that Usagi would be able to look at her, or stay in  the same room alone. After what they had done-for over five hours, an  annoying little voice that sounded suspiciously smug snickered in the  back of her mind-she didn’t blame her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But…will she stay my friend?</em> It didn’t matter that Usagi would never feel the same-well, not that  much. She simply needed the blonde’s friendship. After experiencing the  wonderful, breathtaking friendship Usagi had given her, Rei never  wanted to return to the despair filled days, full of whispered taunts  and endless hours of seclusion and pain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Well aren’t I a little bundle of sunshine?</em> She spat in her mind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was the truth. She needed the princess’s friendship.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to go back.” She whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To heartbreak? To days watching her laugh and love with someone else?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei inhaled sharply. Usagi didn’t love her…in <em>that</em> sense. She was in love with Mamoru. The miko felt the sharp, acidic taste of jealousy sting her throat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>I wish he would just…</em>She  blinked and felt tears prick at her eyes. Was this what she’d been  reduced to? She saw Mamoru as her brother! Was she truly that rotten?  Wanting him to simply disappear? Leaving Usagi all alone, and worse,  endangering an innocent little girl’s life?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Now <em>she </em>wanted to disappear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And it would be easy…simply get up and walk away from her mother and, as terribly corny as it sounded, walk towards the light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was so easy that Rei didn’t notice that she’d stood up and was walking away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>We said we wouldn’t talk about what if’s!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her eyes widened at Usagi’s voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Wait, I know! I’ll kill them and Queen Beryl and so that you won’t have to die!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No one said I <em>have</em> to die,” she whispered automatically as the tears fell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rei-chan, please! We said we’d be together to the end! Don’t leave me! Don’t leave me all alone!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But  you’re not alone.” She hiccupped. Why? Why were these memories  re-surfacing?! Was someone trying to get her to think twice?! Why?! She  didn’t deserve to be saved! Didn’t she just wish for Mamoru to  disappear!?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you die,” her mother said from her place on the ground. “then who will protect her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The other Senshi could do it. She was just another soldier who would gladly lay down her life for her princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Think about it Rei. Don't you want to protect your special someone?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No duh. Usagi needed protecting. But she wasn’t the one to do it. With her luck, someone would need to protect Usagi from her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  certainly can’t protect her if you’re dead. Plus…don’t you think Usagi  will be sad? Yes, the one destined for her might be able to protect her  heart in most cases…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Most cases?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“ But she needs you to  protect her heart from all of it. Think; who was there when her heart  was broken into tiny little pieces?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Don’t worry Usa; Chibi-chan will come back.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You think so Rei-chan?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I know so.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Thanks…thank you Rei-chan.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She may not be <em>in</em> love with you.” Mother continued. “But she does love you Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Things  became a bit clearer. Rei began to turn and slowly shuffle back to her  mother. Once she had knelt in front of the woman, Rei’s mother smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What made you come back?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because,  if I die…” Rei lifted her head and her eyes sparkled with unshed tears.  “I…I won’t be able to protect her.” Rei’s mother leaned and kissed her  daughter’s forehead. Rei blinked as everything suddenly darkened.  “Then, my sweet little phoenix,” the air whispered. “protect…”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When she re-opened her eyes, all she saw was white. For a moment, she thought that she’d really died and gone to Heaven.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But Heaven didn’t snore. Or drool. Or murmur something about pickled beets and how it wanted to eat the cotton candy mountain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…. At least, she <em>hoped</em> it didn’t…No wait. There was only one person who snored, drooled, and dreamed of pickled beats and cotton candy mountains.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usa?” she croaked, feeling her tongue stick to the roof of her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>Snoooooore.</strong></em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em><strong>Snoooooore.</strong></em> Huh. De ja vue….</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi!”  With a small gasp, the blonde shot up, wiping away at the trickle of  drool at her mouth. She blinked the sleep out of her eyes, still  clueless to the change with her favorite miko. Rei hid her grin and sat  up, slowly, so that she could surprise Usagi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She forgot that a  hospital johnny’s ties in the back were always, suspiciously, loose,  and said gown was beginning to slip off of her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  didn’t pay attention to it as she smirked, crossed her arms and  laughed, “Sleepin on the job? And I thought I was special.” There was a  second as Usagi stared in wonder at her no longer comatose friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em><strong>You’re alive</strong></em>!”  Usagi cried out as she practically lunged at an unsuspecting Rei,  wrapping her arms tightly around her friend’s neck and, accidentally of  course, straddling her waist. Rei made a sound between a cough and a  wheez as her air supply was cut off. Usagi continued to sob out “You’re  alive!”.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“U…sa…gi...choking…not breathing…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You’re alive</em>! Oh my God I thought you were dead or in a coma or pretending to be in a coma just to freak me out but you’re alive—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I…won’t…be…if…you…don’t…let me…<em>breathe</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t believe it because I saw the bullet hit you and you were falling  and I was so worried because you didn’t breathe for a second—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usa….seriously…you’re cutt…ing off…my wind pipe!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s a wind pipe? Is it that thing the doctors had to shove up your nose?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No…you stupid…<em>idjit</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well if you can still call me bad names—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em><strong>Goddammit woman I’m suffocating! Stop hugging me</strong></em>!”  Usagi jumped and undid her vice grip on Rei’s neck, in the process  undoing the only string on the miko’s hospital johnny. The paper-like  gown pooled at her waist, leaving the patient butt naked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With Usagi still straddling the patient’s waist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that they noticed. Rei was far too busy gasping in precious, precious , air while Usagi bit her lip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay,”  Rei gulped, still unaware of their predicament. “You can hug me again,  but,” She looked up at the blonde with pleading eyes. “Just don’t try  to kill me again.” Usagi giggled, and slowly wrapped her arms around  Rei’s bare shoulders—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wait. Bare? Well, at least no one would see  them. Rei smiled and snuggled into her friend's embrace. This was  perfect. Nothing could <em>possibly</em> ruin it for her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere, the evil twins Irony and Inconvenience laughed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Haruka slammed open the door, brought in by Usagi’s screams.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan what going—<em>whoa</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna and Hotaru entered next, only for Setsuna to shriek and cover the Senshi of Saturn’s eyes. “<em>Not in front of the children</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Setsuna-mama, are Usagi-chan and Rei-chan gonna be like Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama now?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look  what you’ve done!” Michiru added, pointing an accusing finger towards  to now blushing, and still embracing, duo. “You’ve corrupted Hotaru!  You’re scarring her for life!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s scarring me for life? <em>I don’t get it</em>!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smirked somewhat roguishly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wow, couldn’t you guys have waited until <em>after</em> Rei was healed until you acted like bunnies?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere, the poor, poor, abused Pun was beaten until he or she bleed.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A/N:  Okay, there ya go. Not only do ya get an update, all those bad things  that swirled in your heads about Rei-chan diein and stuff—they’re gone.  What? Did you <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">actually</span></em> think I was gonna kill off Rei-chan?
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kai: You’ve done it before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shiki: Shiki see Arashi-sama kill off Rei-sama before! Yes Shiki did!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">…..Meet my muses. Yes. As in <em>plural</em>. Not only do I get tortured by having a <em>male</em> muse (who is a very smexah bishi) I get stuck with a crazy <em>female</em> one who refers to herself in past tense. –sigh- Woe is me.</span></p>
