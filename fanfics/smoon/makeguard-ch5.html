Makoto knew it was there. The realization came sometime around the 
second day of the trip, she guessed. Though one could not really tell 
much of what day it was when traveling faster than the speed of light 
through space. There were those who kept track of the hours; she was not 
one of them. The first sign had been the feathers. Well, there had only 
been two, and small at that. But Makoto knew that none of the cargo on 
the upper deck contained anything of that nature. Suspicion led to 
investigation and then to discovery. So as not to arouse alarm aboard 
her ship, she investigated the matter solely on her own.

Yesterday had been spent nonchalantly surveying the deck. In fact, 
Makoto had not been below since sometime after she pulled the tallies of 
the ship&#39;s cargo many hours before. Once she found that she was indeed 
right about the contents, she then noticed that there was a crate 
unaccounted for. And that&#39;s when the order for the crew to rest came in. 
She didn&#39;t need any of them getting in the way when she took care of 
what she presumed to be residing inside the large wooden box. It was 
most almost definitely a Chimera. Coming to the conclusion was quite 
easy when one considered the size of the crate and the quality of the 
feathers. She had seen those same feathers on occasion during her 
training throughout the years and already knew how to deal with them. It 
wouldn&#39;t be so hard to put this one away as long as no one interfered.

The one thing she couldn&#39;t figure out, though, was how quiet it was 
being. Did it know that she knew of its presence? Was it waiting for an 
opportune moment to strike? From what she knew of the beasts, patience 
did not come easily to them. So she found it strange that it had yet to 
make its move. So she waited. The crate sat at the stern of the ship 
among the others for hours upon hours, while she herself took &quot;watch&quot; at 
the bow, on the quarter deck. The crew would rest for several more 
hours. If it did not emerge before then, she would have no choice but to 
approach it herself. Which could prove to be very dangerous, for 
Chimeras were tricky creatures. It was bound to have a plan formed if 
she even came near the crate. Knowing the beast must be keeping watch on 
her as well, she tried to make herself appear as if off guard to see if 
she could lure it out. Makoto feigned sleep, as she lay at the bow, but 
her senses were on alert for any source of movement. She would bring the 
Chimera to her first, where she&#39;d deal with it on equal terms with no 
threat of traps.

Light was a dim thing, glowing silently, swallowed by the blackness of 
space around her. A few lanterns had been placed around the ship, not 
many of the crew frequented the top deck anyway. There was no reason to, 
when everything was really done in steerage. As long as she was there, 
the ship continued its fast trek across the solar system. She had more 
than enough energy to get them there. Despite this, she had to make sure 
that none of them would be on deck for her wait.

After some hours passed, Makoto was about ready to give up her long 
visual when something changed. Shifting a little from side to side, she 
tried to discern what it was. There was no hint of movement in her 
peripheral vision; there were no sounds either. She was beginning to get 
restless. It wasn&#39;t something she felt with her physical senses, but 
something inside of her, a feeling of...well, something. It wasn&#39;t 
friendly or welcoming at all, but that didn&#39;t matter. Somehow the 
feeling was right, there was a kind of kinship with the emotion. She lay 
quite still, waiting for it to become clearer and attempting to steady 
her thoughts. Suddenly there was another feeling, and it was one that 
suggested violence and malice. She&#39;d felt this plenty of times before, 
again there was a rightness to it. Then she realized that part of the 
emotions were being directed at her.

&#39;Nothin alright about that,&#39; she thought, &#39;now get your slow ass over 
here so I can kill you.&#39; Makoto knew what it was now, and opened herself 
to the emotions. The more she allowed herself to feel it, the more exact 
the position of the Chimera was. &#39;That&#39;s it, come on now, I&#39;ve been 
waiting here for hours!&#39; her mind screamed. She wanted to run at it 
right now and rip it to pieces. Feel its hot blood pour from the wounds 
she was soon to inflict upon it. The restlessness was growing, along 
with the emotions rushing through her. &#39;What a rush...what is this?...&#39; 
lying there, she began to sweat. Her mind was a jumble of confused 
thoughts. Some telling her to go for it, others begging her to listen to 
reason. She was apt to jump up right then and forget her plans all 
together. At the same time, though, she knew that was wrong, it wasn&#39;t 
her, was it?

Soon another emotion came crashing into the rest as she heard the hatch 
open on the lower deck. Was it annoyance, worry, fear? &#39;Oh damn, not 
good,&#39; she thought as Shingo&#39;s unmistakable mop of brown hair peeked 
over the now open hatch. Emerging completely onto the deck, he paused 
but a moment before coming closer to her. When he neared her spot on the 
quarter deck, he hesitated in approaching her . Makoto&#39;s thoughts were 
together in a snap, her body relaxed slightly against the cool wood of 
the deck. She rubbed her shirt sleeve over her face slowly, removing the 
dampness there.

&#39;Well crap, get over here.&#39; She waved him over, never moving from her 
position to avoid making the beast retreat, she didn&#39;t want it to know 
that she was aware of it&#39;s presence. Makoto was just going to have to 
make some adjustments to her original plan.

Shingo came to her and sat down, blocking her view of the dark figure. 
Not that she was looking at it anyway. Shouldn&#39;t need to see it, she 
could feel it. Her mind was not as chaotic as it had been moments 
before, but the feeling was still there, threatening to take control of 
her. The beast was stopped now, probably pondering how to deal with this 
new development as she was. Shingo&#39;s voice broke into her emotional 
maelstrom as he relayed a message from the navigator. So they were 
making good time, she had expected nothing less. This could have waited 
and now she was really annoyed. She wondered if he&#39;d noticed anything at 
the stern when he came from the lower deck. Makoto needed to keep her 
mind clear right now and keep Shingo from asking the wrong questions, 
and if that meant having a long conversation with him, then so be it.

So of course the first thing he wanted to know waswhy she was out here 
to begin with. &#39;Dammit, I was hoping he wouldn&#39;t ask that.&#39;

Keeping watch of course,&quot; she asnwered him, sighing loudly. &#39;Oh that was 
a great answer, thank Jove he&#39;s only thirteen, else I&#39;d feel a bit 
stupid telling anyone older I&#39;m keeping watch with my eyes closed.&#39; He 
started picking at his clothes.

&quot;Oh&quot; was his small reply, but seeing as how he was still a bit confused, 
she decided to take over the direction of their talk.

&quot;It&#39;s good that we&#39;ll be there soon though Shingo. The sooner we get 
there, the sooner we can leave.&quot; Makoto rolled onto her stomach so that 
she was now face down on the deck, cushioning her forehead with her 
arms. &#39;Ain&#39;t that the truth.&#39; She again noticed that he was picking at 
his clothes, and for some reason this was really starting to grate on 
her nerves. Shingo had been nervous from the moment they&#39;d set foot on 
the ship and seemed to stay that way ever since. &#39;Fidgeting...why does 
he keep doing that!&#39;

He continued asking her questions, weird ones, about the palace and the 
princesses and other things she could really care less about. All the 
while Shingo&#39;s pant leg was becoming more thread bare by the moment. 
&#39;Why is he getting so nervous and excited about this?&#39; When she told him 
that he was going to meet the other royalty he seemed fit to explode or 
something.

They&#39;d elapsed into silence, his fidgeting now reaching an all time 
high. &#39;Dammit, that&#39;s it.&#39; reaching out, she stopped Shingo&#39;s hand with 
her own. &#39;Why&#39;d I do that?&#39; She quickly gave him an excuse about needing 
to properly represent Jupiter and all that formal mess, and removed her 
hand from over his. She quickly became annoyed with herself. &#39;Why am I 
becoming mad at Shingo? Such a trivial thing shouldn&#39;t matter to me like 
this. Something&#39;s wrong here.&#39;

Shingo quickly figured out that he was attending the ball with her, and 
his reaction was something of a surprise. &#39;What&#39;s wrong now?&#39; she 
thought, as well as voiced.

If he was going to explode before, he was about to turn to dust where he 
sat stock still with shock. The boy was obviously becoming distressed 
over this whole event. He began to ramble about being the only servant 
boy there and other such nonsense. Funny, she had never once thought of 
him as a servant. His duress was uncalled for really, considering that 
fact that all the attention would be directed at the long absent 
princess and her Jovian soldiers. &#39;Ha! Bet they won&#39;t see that coming.&#39; 
Makoto had no &#39;court&#39; her fellow warriors were here counsel. She&#39;d 
brought an even number of her best men and women with her. They would 
all train together to pass the time, she&#39;d figured. &#39;Shingo can hide 
behind one of them if it becomes to much for him,&#39; she truly was 
concerned for the boy at the moment, he seemed so afraid of these 
people. &#39;They&#39;re just a bunch of pampered princesses, nothing to be 
afraid of there. What he should really be fearing is the thing lurking 
behind him somewhere back there in the darkness.&#39;

As her mind shifted to the other matter...the one that was now absent 
from her being, she cursed. &#39;Shit, now what? The feeling is gone. How 
did that happen? Hells, when did it happen?&#39;

She needed to locate the beast, and she needed to do it now. It could be 
anywhere, and Shingo was still here. Her plans were falling apart, 
everything would be ruined. Someone could die if she didn&#39;t act soon. 
Sitting up, she put a hand on Shing&#39;s small shoulder, she wanted to make 
him feel a little better as well as take a look behind him.

&quot;You have absolutely nothing to worry about Shingo. As long as you stick 
with me no one will bother you, and if they do it&#39;ll be the last anyone 
sees of them anyway.&quot; She took her hand from his shoulder and made a 
fist. &quot;I&#39;ll protect you and the others no matter what. Nobody messes 
with my people.&quot; Her face was a cold mask of calm.

Shingo bowed his head and Makoto looked beyond him...straight at two 
glowing red orbs that seemed to float in the darkness that covered the 
stairs to the deck. Sweat started to bead on her forehead as her other 
hand was occupied with sliding a small knife free from her tattered 
leather boot.

&#39;Alright now, there&#39;s no going back for either of us,&#39; she thought as 
Shingo looked up, &#39;For any of us,&#39; she corrected. Her gaze was still 
fixed on the eyes in the darkness. They were moving now, coming closer, 
bringing that feeling with them. Makoto made a motion for Shingo to 
move, he needed to be out of her way and find someplace safe. &#39;Move 
dammit!&#39; she yelled in her mind. Her hand waving furiously to the right. 
Finally, the boy got the message. The moment he moved she was already 
leaping over him, running at the creature now emerging onto the quarter 
deck.

The Chimera stormed onto the deck in a burst of speed that rivaled 
anything she&#39;d ever encountered. It was much bigger than she had 
originally anticipated. Her reaction was one of amazement, and she found 
herself wondering how it had fit into that crate. &#39;Must have been quite 
an uncomfortable ride.&#39;

This Chimera looked to be a combination of a feline body and a 
serpentine tail. Its head was equine, but the mouth was horribly 
disfigured by a set of large teeth; it would take three of the dagger 
she held to match them. Most amazing of all was its size. It was easily 
two times as tall as she was. Now that was saying something. The height 
of Jovians was one of the main characteristics that distinguished them 
from the other races in the kingdom. The men were usually taller than 
the woman, however, Makoto had obtained her father&#39;s height, so that she 
towered over most male fighters.

When she finally confronted the creature, her power was barely 
constrained. She didn&#39;t want to have to use any of it for this battle if 
she didn&#39;t need to. However, she let a small storm brew up in the 
atmosphere of the ship to intimidate and hopefully confuse the creature.

Oily black wings flapped violently towards her as she leapt to the left, 
feeling the wind against her body. It unsteadied her just long enough 
for the Chimera to swipe at her with a paw full of sharp claws. She was 
clipped on the arm briefly and a pain shot up her shoulder. Ignoring it, 
she came around and under the beast&#39;s outstretched foreleg. Before it 
could pull back, she used her own swiftness to slice at the area 
whereleg connected to body. Black blood splattered her retreating hand 
as she rolled clear of the beast&#39;s other leg. She felt the deck rumble 
below her as its front legs came crashing down in a tangle while it was 
trying to tear at her moving form.

Jumping to her feet, she spun to take advantage of the Chimera&#39;s folly. 
Running forward as fast as her legs would carry her, she used her 
strength to drive her sharp blade into the long mussel that came up as 
her blade drove down, adding to the force. It lodged deeply with a 
slight crunching noise that she could only assume was bone or cartilage. 
The Chimera made a noise somewhere between a roar and a loud hiss. 
Either way, it seemed she had really pissed it off. Lifting its mussel, 
the Chimera jerked roughly upwards, crashing into her lower jaw to send 
her flying backwards onto the deck. The back of her head bounced against 
the wood with a thunk. &#39;

Shit-shit-shit-oooouch!&#39; Makoto scrunched her eyes shut from the pain.

She grabbed the back ofher head to make sure her brain wasn&#39;t hanging 
out anywhere. &#39;Damn that hurt.&#39; She&#39;d now lost her knife, it was still 
in the Chimera&#39;s mussel. The thing&#39;s head was flailing back and forth, 
sprinkling the deck, and her, with its ebony blood.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna have headaches after this one.&quot; Makoto&#39;s eyes shot open as 
she heard something beneath the floor she was currently lying on. There 
were voices and a small thundering that could only be human feet. The 
crew had roused, she would have to kill this thing fast. Rolling quickly 
to the right, she just avoided being stomped. And then to the 
left...avoided being stomped again. &#39;Get on yer damn feet stupid!&#39; her 
mind jeered at her.

Rolling forward with a grunt took her under the Chimera, slipping 
between its hind legs to jump freely to her feet behind it. &#39;Now that 
was some dumb ass luck!&#39; Spinning, she kicked it squarely in its rear.

&quot;Ha!&quot; Makoto shouted triumphantly at the beast. Then ran to the side, in 
the opposite direction it was turning. It was becoming more ornery every 
moment. &#39;I don&#39;t wanna do this, but I&#39;m gonna have to. Nobody on my ship 
is going to die just so we can get to some dumb ball on time.&#39;

With her mind made up, she began to taunt the Chimera harshly. If it 
became mad enough then it would also become reckless and disoriented. 
She was actually starting to enjoy this. A slow smiled formed on her 
lips as she jumped in to pull a feather from the powerful black wings. 
Procuring it, with a loud screech from the creature. She hadn&#39;t heard 
that one yet.

&#39;Wonder how many sounds it makes.&#39; Makoto grinned, &#39;Maybe I can find 
out.&#39; Now she used her true power, the element that Jupiter had endowed 
her with. The one she protected. Raising her hand in a careless gesture 
lighting fell upon the beast in short bursts, making it cry out in pain. 
It twisted upon the deck, writhing, as she rained more and more bolts 
over it. She wanted to torture it, make it feel this pain for as long as 
she could keep it alive. Her eyes had taken on a deadly glare as she 
observed the Chimera. It was weak now, weak enough to simply kill. She 
could kill it with one shock, so why didn&#39;t she?

Her mind refocused as something touched her arm. Whirling to intercept 
it, Makoto found herself gripping Shingo&#39;s small wrist with all her 
might. Eyes cleared along with her mind and the air around them as well. 
There was no more electricity dancing in the atmosphere, the storm was 
over.

She let out a shaky breath as Shingo held something out to her. It 
glittered in the pale light of the lanterns. Her sword. How had she 
forgotten her weapon. She&#39;d hidden it on the deck where she would easily 
be able to get at it if need be. But being so into the moment as she 
was, it was forgotten. There was a crash to the right of them. Looking 
up, Makoto could make out figures rushing up onto the deck. They made it 
to the quarter deck and stopped upon seeing the Chimera. They all had 
weapons, and were looking quite bewildered at the site of a very crispy, 
very large creature on the deck they had been sleeping under only 
moments before.

Releasing Shingo, Makoto took her sword. Walking over to the twitching 
animal, she lodged the sword into its chest, blood pooled out onto the 
deck, slipping around her feet. The twitching stopped and letting out 
one large breath, the Chimera died.

The warriors broke out in cheers and applause for their princess. She 
had single handedly killed such a huge beast, that would have taken 
their collective group to bring down. They each bowed deeply to her and 
sheathed their own sword, as she cleaned her&#39;s free of the dark blood.

Makoto looked at Shingo again, &#39;If he hadn&#39;t come to me...how long would 
I have stood there?&#39; She ran a hand over her weary face.

&quot;I&#39;m going to need rest now. I&#39;ve used up much of my power that I&#39;d 
reserved for this journey. We&#39;re going to have to get this mess cleaned 
up soon before it starts to stink. Keep the claws and teeth as usual, 
the feathers as well. Put the rest in the extra crate on the lower deck 
and seal it tight. It should be fine until we can dispose of it when we 
reach the moon.&quot;

This was going to mess things up quite a bit for them. They were going 
to be a bit late. She could get them there before the ball, but it was 
going to be very close. Her warriors and she weren&#39;t going to get much 
of a rest when they landed. As long as they had enough time to clean up 
and get themselves looking half decent, she had no qualms with that. It 
wasn&#39;t her fault or their&#39;s that a Chimera had been slipped on board.

&quot;Listen up...we&#39;re going to be late.&quot; her warriors suddenly looked a 
little crestfallen. &#39;They really wanna go to this thing don&#39;t they.&#39; 
&quot;Worry not though. We should arrive in enough time for you to prepare 
for the gala. There will be time to clean up, we&#39;ll leave the ship 
maintenance until afer the event.&quot; She walked towards the stairs, &quot;I&#39;m 
going to rest, the ship will continue on a steady course. Navigator, 
return to your post and keep me updated as to our progress.&quot; The crew 
dispersed to complete their appointed tasks.

&quot;What about me Milady?&quot; Shingo&#39;s small voice asked.

Makoto looked to him again and smiled slightly. She looked over at the 
carnage laying on the deck, then back. &quot;Come with me, I&#39;ll see if I can 
gather something up for you to wear for the ball. Can&#39;t have you going 
threadbare now can we?&quot;

Shingo laughed lightly. &quot;Suppose not Milady.&quot;

&quot;Sorry we won&#39;t be having time to get those clothes made for you. Maybe 
afterwards?&quot;

Shingo nodded his head. &quot;Anything is fine with me Milady.&quot; Makoto nodded 
to his agreement and walked off down the stairs to her cabin.

Shingo reached up to wipe away a tear that had somehow managed to slip 
down along his cheek. &quot;As long as you&#39;re alive Milady, anything and 
everything is fine,&quot; he whispered to her retreating back.</pre>
