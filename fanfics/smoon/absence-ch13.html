<h1>Absence (part 13 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>Tsubasa increased his pace to keep up with Megumi as she marched 
purposefully towards the entrance to the Ragnarok nightclub, the beat of 
rave music matching their footsteps. Tsubasa was still soaking wet from 
the emergency sprinklers at the Yokohama Daily and his shoes squelched 
uncomfortably with his every step. Megumi was in the same condition, but 
it didn&#39;t seem to bother the raven-haired girl.

The nightclub looked like a standard raver&#39;s hangout constructed out of 
a large, unused warehouse. Not a place that Tsubasa would have gone to 
willingly... at least not before his acquaintance with Megumi, &#39;Fighter 
of Justice&#39;, that is. Tsubasa imagined that there were probably all 
sorts of debauched things going in the building. Tsubasa surmised that 
there were lots of youma in the nightclub, but there had to be some 
innocent people in the club as well. Tsubasa looked apprehensively at 
Megumi, hoping that she wouldn&#39;t just torch the place as soon as they 
entered.

The duo approached a heavy-set bouncer who was standing guard at the 
double door entrance of the club. As Tsubasa and Megumi got nearer the 
bouncer&#39;s eyes widened, then bugged out of his head. He was clearly 
shocked at the sight of them for some unknown reason. The man quickly 
unfolded his arms, barged through the doors of the nightclub, then ran 
into the Ragnarok screaming something Tsubasa couldn&#39;t quite catch over 
the loud music that streamed unimpeded out of the entrance before the 
doors closed again.

Tsubasa frowned in confusion, and, not without a little suspicion. 
Megumi wasn&#39;t dressed *that* strangely... not enough to cause that sort 
of reaction. Perhaps it was the sight of the pair of them, both sopping 
wet on a clear night, which had elicited the reaction. But Tsubasa 
sincerely doubted it....

&quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Megumi announced, interrupting Tsubasa&#39;s 
speculations. She walked over to the double doors of the Ragnarok 
nightclub and pushed them open. After she entered, the doors swung shut 
behind her.

Tsubasa nodded to Megumi&#39;s retreating figure and leaned against the wall 
beside the doors to wait for her... he didn&#39;t really want to wind up 
like Sanjuro anyway. Tsubasa hoped the reporter was okay; he had seemed 
pretty messed up. The ugly purple youma must have done something pretty 
horrible to the irritating man, Tsubasa reflected as he began to wring 
out his sodden shirt.

All of a sudden, the double doors of the club burst open and swarms of 
frantic people flooded out, all screaming in panic. Inside, the air was 
filled with inhuman cries and whooshing noises that rose above the manic 
music. Every now and then, the sound of Megumi&#39;s voice was mixed in with 
the cacophony as she yelled out incomprehensible phrases. The exiting 
ravers continued to run out of the Ragnarok and Tsubasa pressed himself 
as close as he could against the building&#39;s wall, trying not to get 
swept away in the crowd. Then a frosted glass window unexpectedly 
exploded outward next to him and some sort of blue energy blast flew 
out, careering off towards the night&#39;s sky. Many of the people ducked 
reflexively as the bolt and flakes of glass sailed over them.

Tsubasa looked anxiously to his right as a flaming figure staggered 
blindly through the doors and out onto the street, causing the mob of 
fleeing ravers to part before it. The blazing figure gave guttural 
shouts of agony as it stumbled about aimlessly, wildly flailing its arms 
all over the place. It then fell forward to the ground, unmoving, the 
flames still burning high on its body. Tsubasa covered his mouth and 
nose with a wet sleave, attempting to block out the stench of burning 
flesh. People had now stopped running out of the nightclub, and all had 
dispersed into the night, leaving Tsubasa as the only one standing 
around.

The brown-haired man jumped when an arrow, which seemed to be made 
entirely of fire, startled him by slamming into one of the Ragnarok&#39;s 
doors. The door swung outwards momentarily before ripping completely off 
of its hinges from the fierce impact. The wooden door immediately 
exploded into a ball of fire, sending chunks of flaming wood flying in 
all directions. The debris clattered down the dark street to burn 
themselves out.

Tsubasa was considering whether or not to run like hell when everything 
went relatively quiet suddenly. Only the dance music could be heard 
clearly, but over that noise, he could still detect muffled, far away, 
shouts within his hearing range. Tsubasa gathered up his courage and 
decided to take a peek inside the club. He prayed he wouldn&#39;t see any 
charred human bodies courtesy of an overzealous and uncaring Megumi.

As Tsubasa was about to have a look inside, more people hobbled out of 
the now doorless entrance. But these individuals were raggedly dressed 
and looked badly hurt... their wounds appeared old, though, to Tsubasa&#39;s 
eyes. Their bodies were caked with a liberal layer of dirt and grime, 
also. Upon closer examination, he noticed that some had shattered chains 
dangling from manacles clamped to their wrists and ankles, the edges of 
the broken links still glowing hotly. The youma... they must have kept 
prisoners, Tsubasa realised with terrible understanding. And by the 
looks of it, the monsters&#39; unfortunate inmates had not been treated well 
at all.

The music in the Ragnarok nightclub began to wane, getting more 
distorted as time went by. Tsubasa peered inside the building. He really 
hoped the owners had insurance. The interior of the place was like a war 
zone. Small fires burnt nearly everywhere and the fast decaying bodies 
of strange, barbecued creatures decorated the dance floor. The bar was a 
roaring inferno and Tsubasa thought he could see blackened limbs 
sticking out from behind it that resembled gnarled tree branches. The DJ 
booth was partially aflame, causing the music it still beat out to be 
detrimentally affected.

Tsubasa turned his gaze upwards to the ceiling and saw waves of fire 
creeping along it, slowly consuming it. The blaze currently gutting the 
building also sent flaming showers of debris all over the large room. 
Any tables or chairs that had escaped initial conflagration were now set 
alight by the raindrops of flame. It was obvious to Tsubasa that the 
nightclub&#39;s structural integrity wasn&#39;t going to last. Wherever Megumi 
was, she had better hurry up!

From somewhere in the back of the club, Tsubasa heard a bestial scream 
that was cut off abruptly. Megumi then appeared from a door near the 
stage. She walked over to him, nonchalantly stepping through the many 
small fires dotting the floor, but avoiding the larger ones.

&quot;He wasn&#39;t here,&quot; the Fire Senshi declared, &quot;but there&#39;s a Honda factory 
not too far from here. That&#39;s where he is.&quot;

Tsubasa assumed that Megumi meant the leader of the youma and would have 
asked, but the raven-haired girl was already moving past him to reach 
the exit. Tsubasa hurried after her, dodging coals of fire that rained 
down as he went... his former neighbour didn&#39;t even seem to be bothered 
by them.

Tsubasa noticed that Megumi&#39;s clothes had dried off--probably from the 
heat caused by all of the fires burning inside the building--the 
majority, most likely, being caused by her own hands. He could also see 
that she had sustained a few more injuries, but decided not to mention 
them; it would be pointless. It didn&#39;t take the most observant of 
individuals to tell that Megumi was determined to finish off all of the 
youma tonight. It was the look in her eyes; in the things she had said. 
Hell, her intentions were blatantly clear through sheer body language 
alone. Tsubasa just hoped that the whole ordeal wouldn&#39;t finish the fire 
warrior off permanently as well.

******

Khairephon shouted out rousing encouragement--or rather, compelling 
threats--to hasten his three youma lackeys&#39; efforts in preparing to open 
the primary interdimensional passageway that the great warrior and his 
siblings had used to invade this plane several days before. He was 
growing impatient; he should have been back at the Ragnarok nightclub by 
now. Santhesis would be waiting there with new information for him on 
the whereabouts of the human female that was meddling in their affairs 
so much....

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Without warning a fiery arrow burst through the back of one youma&#146;s 
head, which then erupted into flames. The youma collapsed over the 
pattern it had been drawing on the concrete floor of the factory, its 
ruined head quickly burning to ash from the blaze.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Khairephon, with an almost casual indifference, turned around to face 
the entrance of the car factory as he felt the heat of another arrow 
sail past him. The flaming projectile slammed into the stomach of a 
second youma, exploding on impact. The blast propelled the creature 
backwards and into a stack of empty metal drums, its roasting remains 
obscured from view by the scorching flames that engulfed it. The 
remaining youma minion growled low in its throat and prepared to attack, 
but Khairephon raised a hand, signalling it to hold back.

&quot;So. You must be the human that has been fighting my youma. You don&#39;t 
seem very special at all,&quot; Khairephon mocked the girl standing at the 
entrance of the factory a short distance away. He observed her curiously 
as she lowered her arms from where they had been previously wielding a 
bow crafted wholly out of fire.

&quot;You don&#39;t seem special either,&quot; the female replied, directing a cold, 
piercing stare at the thuggishly dressed man.

Khairephon smirked, a cocky half-smile coming to his rugged, somewhat 
manic features. He spared a glance at her male companion a couple of 
steps behind her and then dismissed him from his mind. The pathetic 
weakling was no threat; he appeared to be a mere normal human who could 
be easily crushed at his leisure.

&quot;How did you know I would be here?&quot; Khairephon asked.

&quot;I asked someone,&quot; the girl stated simply. &quot;By the way,&quot; she continued, 
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go clubbing at the Ragnarok for a while. Seems it&#39;s become a 
real fire hazard....&quot;

Khairephon blinked at her, then frowned, his red eyebrows forming a deep 
V. She couldn&#39;t have destroyed his headquarters. Sure, the youma there 
had only been made up of a few of his warriors and the rest of 
Thrinakie&#39;s bookish types, but still... there had to have been a dozen 
there at least. Out of the corner of his eye, Khairephon saw the youma 
beside him tense. It was, apparently, his last surviving youma in this 
world and it was obviously a little disturbed by the news.

Khairephon walked closer to the human, dismissing her claims. It didn&#39;t 
matter if his headquarters had been wiped out and, with it, his youma 
forces; they could be replaced once he had dealt with the interfering 
girl. Besides, those of his followers who had been slain were clearly 
not worthy to be in his ranks anyway; the human had done him a service, 
really.

&quot;Well, it is time I faced you anyway. I&#39;ve been dying to test this human 
body out in real combat. Shall we dance?&quot; Khairephon challenged the 
female, his smirk returning.

Without waiting for an answer, the brilliant warrior moved his body into 
a rather relaxed fighting stance, reminiscent of street brawlers, his 
smirk becoming a full, confident grin.

******

Sailor Mars positioned herself into her own combat stance in response to 
Khairephon&#39;s, looking grimly and unwaveringly into the punk&#39;s burning 
red eyes all the while.

&quot;You had better run,&quot; she whispered out the corner of her mouth to 
Tsubasa who, after witnessing the prior scene of her pyrotechnic 
displays, had been unable to move or speak while watching the verbal 
exchange between Khairephon and herself.

Then Tsubasa, evidently coming to his senses and finally finding his 
legs, ran off to the right to seek refuge deeper into the plant. Mars 
lost sight of him when he sprinted between factory equipment and headed 
towards the abundant boxed, and unboxed, car parts stacked high about 
the area. Sailor Mars noticed, too, that the surviving youma darted 
after him; no doubt to hunt down the brown-haired man as a tiger would 
hunt a deer. She ignored the predatory monster and refocused on 
Khairephon, who was the bigger, and primary, threat. Tsubasa would have 
to fend for himself.

&quot;You know, I have never lost a fight....&quot; Khairephon remarked 
matter-of-factly, still grinning at her.

&quot;You know, I&#39;ve heard that before... back in Tokyo. The youma who said 
it, died,&quot; Sailor Mars responded emotionlessly.

Khairephon&#39;s eyes widened in a mixture of recognition and confusion. 
&quot;You&#39;re... you can&#39;t be...&quot; he started, clearly perplexed and somewhat 
amazed, his bravado vanishing.

But Mars had had enough of talk and waiting; she wanted to fight.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A fireball streaked towards Khairephon, the opening attack jogging the 
man out of his stupor. He darted effortlessly to the side and out of the 
fiery projectile&#39;s path, then ran at Sailor Mars. He moved like 
quicksilver, striking at her face with a leather-clad fist.

Mars redirected the blow away from her with an arm and countered fluidly 
with a left hook to her opponent&#39;s own face.

Khairephon ducked and executed a leg sweep, catching the miko unawares 
and tripping her onto her side.

Mars rolled hastily to her left as a heavy black boot crunched down on 
the floor where she had just lain, leaving a crumbly footprint behind in 
the concrete. Sailor Mars flipped to her feet and preformed a spinning 
heel kick at Khairephon, catching him firmly on the side of his head. 
However, the Fire Senshi&#39;s adversary shrugged the hit off as if it were 
nothing, and then smashed both of his palms into Mars&#39; now vulnerable 
chest. She was knocked violently off of her feet and back onto the 
floor. Sailor Mars rolled her body quickly backwards, sprung to a 
standing position, and then strafed to the right just as Khairephon flew 
past her, while trying to hit her with a crippling flying kick.

Sailor Mars shook her right arm painfully. It ached badly from 
redirecting Khairephon&#39;s first punch. It also hurt to breathe--she was 
sure she had two palm shaped bruises on her chest by now. Mars couldn&#39;t 
afford to let Khairephon get any more solid blows on her. It seemed the 
creature possessed an unnatural strength that far surpassed a normal 
human being&#39;s....

Khairephon spun around, kicking at Sailor Mars&#39; head, interrupting her 
very short respite. She quickly jumped backwards and out of her 
opponent&#39;s range.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A globe of fire crashed into Khairephon&#39;s chest, the close proximity 
making it impossible to dodge. The only immediate reaction the thug had 
to the hot flames that licked at his torso, was a feral growl through 
gritted teeth... more in anger than pain.

Sailor Mars ducked and rolled to her left as Khairephon&#39;s juggernaut 
fist rammed into a thick, steel support girder behind her, the metal 
buckling with a dull metallic thud. Mars sprang to her feet, kicking him 
swiftly in the face as she did so.

However, Khairephon reacted fast to the attack by grabbing the Senshi of 
Fire&#39;s leg, ready to bring his elbow down upon it and snap it like a 
twig.

Sailor Mars leapt into the air and delivered another powerful kick to 
her foe&#39;s face with her free leg, forcing him to let go of her other 
one. She landed on her stomach and struck out with both feet behind her, 
supporting herself on her hands. Sailor Mars&#39; double kick made hard 
contact with Khairephon&#39;s midsection, bashing him back a few steps 
towards the bent steel girder. Mars flipped over and onto her feet, then 
followed up her manoeuvre with a spinning side kick, ramming her foot 
into Khairephon&#39;s skull.

The brutish man shook his head and then smirked smugly at Mars, before 
cart wheeling to his left and smoothly following the move by lashing out 
at the raven-haired girl with an arm as he became upright.

Sailor Mars nimbly evaded the attack, dropping into a crouch, then 
punched with all her might into Khairephon&#39;s groin. Khairephon&#39;s smirk 
was instantly wiped off of his face and replaced by a very painful 
expression. That, too, was soon wiped off as Mars gave the youma leader 
a final devastating uppercut as she rose.

Khairephon staggered backwards and fell to one knee, breathing heavily. 
He reached up to touch his face gingerly, then looked in astonishment at 
the blood that had appeared on his hand. Khairephon glared at Sailor 
Mars with pure hatred.

&quot;Human bodies are weak anyway,&quot; he seethed.

Khairephon let out a cry of excruciating agony as his clothes started to 
split apart, the black leather ripping as though it were tissue paper. 
There was a crackling sound as bones elongated and strengthened. His 
human skin ruptured, revealing dark red flesh beneath, the colour of 
brimstone, and decorated with a network of hideous blue veins. 
Khairephon&#39;s eyes bulged and grew, turning yellow as each pupil was 
squashed into a black vertical line. A quadruple set of horns erupted 
from his skull and a bright red mane matching the hair on his human head 
sprouted in a line down the middle of his back. Khairephon sustained his 
unholy cry, its pitch turning more bestial with every passing second. 
His jaw cracked and lengthened, his teeth turning into daggers. 
Khairephon continued to grow larger; his hands now twice the size of a 
human&#39;s torso and having nails like sword blades. A tail grew from the 
small of his back, the end adorned with lumpy, bony protrusions.

His transformation complete, Khairephon stood up on his powerful new 
legs and gave a mighty, unearthly roar, flexing muscular arms that could 
pass for thick, dark red, tree trunks. The windows of the Honda plant 
shook and some even shattered with his animalistic bellow.

Sailor Mars looked at the shredded skin and clothes left behind by 
Khairephon, then back up at the huge beast that had replaced the figure 
that had once resembled a man. How such a huge creature could fit into a 
human form was beyond Mars&#39; comprehension. Her first impression was that 
he was some kind of demon straight from the pits of Hell. But whatever 
Khairephon was, he had to be destroyed.

Khairephon grinned evilly down at the diminutive Sailor Mars, the 
gesture making the beast&#39;s expression all the more demonic, if that were 
possible. &quot;Now you see the *real* me... and why I&#39;ve never lost a 
fight!&quot; he roared, clenching one hand into a colossal fist, his huge 
muscles making thick, rope-like cords on his arm.

Sailor Mars looked up at the demon and swallowed hard, trepidation 
demolishing her apathetic persona. This was certainly not good.

&quot;See me... and know fear....&quot; Khairephon whispered, the low rumbling of 
his still substantially loud voice causing the foundations of the 
building to vibrate.

Mars&#39; heart was suddenly gripped with an unnatural terror. It was like 
she was reduced to a child afraid of the dark, cowering in a corner. She 
collapsed to her knees, her head bowed. The Fire Senshi couldn&#39;t even 
look at Khairephon; he was fear incarnate. She was paralysed, all will 
to fight fleeing from her mind. Her heart beat faster and faster, as if 
trying to rip out of her chest and flee from the terrible fiend before 
her. Sailor Mars heard Khairephon&#39;s booming laugh echo around her, 
causing the terror inside her to strengthen its icy grip on her 
quivering heart, and in turn, freezing her body. The energy was drawn 
from her limbs, leaving them about as effective as heavy lead weights. 
There was no fight left in her.

******

Tsubasa ran a little faster when he heard a truly nightmarish howl come 
from behind him. It was so powerful that the floor beneath his feet 
quaked. He hoped the sound was because Megumi had struck the youma 
leader with a killing blow... or something like that. Tsubasa stopped 
his frantic dash and leaned against a car chassis to catch his breath. 
While he was contemplating whether to flee the factory all together, he 
felt a sudden urge to look behind him.

Standing partially in the darkness between two piles of car parts was 
the last youma Megumi had left unscathed. It was green and resembled a 
humanoid lizard, possessing a thick covering of scales. The monster 
looked like a giant upright crocodile. Oh no, Tsubasa panicked... where 
the hell was Megumi? She was supposed to save him from this kind of 
stuff!

Tsubasa bolted at the same moment the youma&#39;s extra long tongue flew out 
of its mouth towards him, just missing his leg. Tsubasa ran as if his 
life depended on it... which, in fact, it did. The brown-haired man&#39;s 
mind raced with his heart, trying to think of what he should do. He 
couldn&#39;t go back to Megumi; what if she was still fighting that punk 
guy? He was on his own. That thought alone was enough to make Tsubasa 
instantly despair and a small, pitiful moan escaped his throat.

Tsubasa screamed when he felt something grab his ankle. He reflexively 
latched onto a yellow forklift&#39;s blade in front of him with both hands 
and quickly looked over his shoulder, expecting the worst. The youma&#39;s 
long, flexible pink tongue had wrapped itself around his ankle and was 
attempting to pull him into its fang-filled mouth.

Tsubasa whimpered loudly at the horrible sight and held on even tighter 
to the forklift, madly praying to every deity he could think of to save 
him. He was going to be eaten by a youma! Oh god, what a way to go! 
Tsubasa had known this was going to happen, damn it! Why hadn&#39;t he 
stayed with Sanjuro at the Yokohama Daily, or better yet, stayed in the 
reporter&#39;s apartment in safety, Tsubasa mentally berated himself as he 
struggled to retain his grip on the forklift blade. Though he tried with 
all his might to hold on, the youma met his increased resistance with 
its superhuman strength. The youma&#39;s pulled so hard, the man felt that 
his leg could be torn off. God, he was such an idiot. Tsubasa just *had* 
to stay with Megumi, didn&#39;t he? Sap! She didn&#39;t even like him! What if 
the lizard monster digested things the way a snake did?! His poor broken 
body would be slowly dissolved by acid for days within its stomach!

&quot;Oh nooooooo!!&quot; Tsubasa wailed at the awful thought, becoming hysterical 
as he desperately tried to maintain his gradually loosening grasp on the 
forklift, his knuckles whitening in the effort.

Tsubasa heard a whisper behind him and felt a gust of wind. He suddenly 
lost his grip on the forklift blade and fell flat on his face upon the 
floor. The youma soared over the top of him, having been blasted in the 
back by something with tremendous force.

Tsubasa covered his eyes as the youma was impaled on the two forklift 
blades, its dark green blood splattering all over him. Tsubasa blinked 
up in confusion at the creature&#39;s skewered corpse dangling on the 
forklift, still twitching slightly. It was a welcome, yet nauseating, 
sight and almost made him lose his dinner. What... what had just 
happened? Had Megumi...?

Tsubasa pried the dead youma&#39;s tongue from his ankle gingerly, not 
really wishing to touch the slimy thing, then tried to wipe the green 
blood from his face. He turned around to face his saviour, expecting to 
see the irritated expression of his former neighbour.

&quot;Megumi, you have the best...&quot; Tsubasa started, but suddenly stopped at 
the sight of the statuesque figure before him. &quot;You&#39;re not... who are 
you?&quot;

******

&quot;Such a pity,&quot; mocked Khairephon, &quot;and here I thought I had finally met 
a worthy opponent; but it looks like you&#39;ll die like all of the others 
who have faced me.&quot;

Sailor Mars had never felt such fear before in all her life. She knew in 
the back of her mind that it wasn&#39;t real, that the terror was some sort 
of power Khairephon possessed, but the knowledge didn&#39;t help--she was 
still completely petrified. Mars&#39; breathing was quick and shallow as her 
rapidly beating heart pumped adrenaline through her veins at a frenzied 
rate. Sailor Mars knew she had to move or she would die, but she just 
couldn&#39;t muster the strength or will to do so.

Khairephon chuckled and swatted the Fire Senshi like a fly with a large 
hand. The warrior was knocked onto her back and slid along the floor, 
unresponsive.

Sailor Mars curled into a ball, her eyes tightly shut. She was aware of 
blood trickling out of her nose, but it only served to heighten the 
unnatural terror that gripped her even more. She heard Khairephon laugh 
evilly above her once again, the demon taking a perverse pleasure at the 
sight of her quivering form. She didn&#39;t want it to end like this....

Sailor Mars wondered where that thought had come from. Hadn&#39;t she wanted 
it all to end? Her miserable existence? She had believed that she did... 
yet Khairephon was still alive. But Mars had fought so hard already; 
didn&#39;t she deserve to finally rest? Her body throbbed all over, her 
wounds humming in constant pain despite the amount of adrenaline 
shooting through her veins. The demon was still laughing at her, his 
voice echoing around her. Enveloping her. Closing her in....

Mars squeezed her body into an even tighter ball. The miko&#39;s heart was 
pounding so hard in her ears. No, this was the end. She had always 
thought she would go out in a blaze of glory... not shivering on the 
floor like a coward.

Sailor Mars gasped suddenly. She felt something... something deep inside 
her. It was as if some sort of force was pulling her, calling her. It 
wasn&#39;t strong, it was barely there in fact; the tiniest pinprick. But 
she still felt it.

Sailor Mars blinked her blurry lavender eyes open. Her photo was in 
front of her face; the one of her and Usagi. It must have fallen out of 
her coat pocket sometime during the fight. No. Mars couldn&#39;t give in. 
She couldn&#39;t let that beast win and let it wreak havoc on the world 
because she had failed to stop it when she&#39;d had the chance. Sailor Mars 
couldn&#39;t die now... not when she was needed.

The stray thought was growing stronger within her mind. Sailor Mars was 
*needed*. If she died here, who would destroy Khairephon? He would be 
able to re-establish his hold on Yokohama; bring more youma. The other 
Sailor Senshi didn&#39;t even know about him. But that didn&#39;t feel right... 
was that why she was truly needed? It didn&#39;t matter; Usagi would be put 
in danger regardless of why she was needed.

The raven-haired girl&#39;s gaze focused on the image of her beautiful 
princess in the photo on the floor. Khairephon was a powerful being; if 
Mars fell here Usagi, and the other Sailors, would have to fight it. 
Usagi could be hurt or even killed. Sailor Mars trembled; not due to the 
terror caused by Khairephon, but from the fear of what could happen to 
Usagi if she faltered here. No fear from a monster could ever compare to 
that.

The icy grip of fear on Sailor Mars&#39; heart evaporated. Khairephon 
abruptly ceased his booming laughter, roared angrily, and then brought 
the sword-nails of one hand down at her. Mars uncoiled her body, rolled 
backwards and onto her feet, the demon&#39;s talons raking four deep scores 
in the floor.

&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;

A bird of fire flew up at the demon, colliding with his wide chest and 
spreading flames around him. He laughed at Sailor Mars&#39; useless attack 
and took another swipe at her. The miko ducked desperately, knowing that 
a single strong hit would be enough to kill her outright. Khairephon&#39;s 
claws tore a steel girder asunder, the ravaged metal squealing loudly. 
Sailor Mars needed a plan right now.

Mars leapt over a conveyer belt... just before a raging Khairephon 
ripped the whole thing from the floor it had been bolted to and threw it 
effortlessly at her. Sailor Mars desperately dove, and then rolled under 
a tall, wide shelf that stored crates full of heavy car engine parts. A 
fraction of a second later the conveyer machinery smashed into the 
shelf, causing it to topple. Mars hurled herself out of the way as 
crates rained down and cracked open on the hard concrete floor, spilling 
their contents everywhere.

The great beast roared again, making the very foundations of the factory 
tremble and causing more items on other shelves to fall from their 
perches. Sailor Mars stopped running and turned to face Khairephon, her 
feet skidding slightly backwards on the floor. She whipped out an ofuda.

&quot;Rin, pyou, tou, sha, kai, jin, retsu, sai, zen. Akuryou taisan!&quot;

Sailor Mars tossed the ward at the demon, the paper landing on his leg.

Khairephon sniggered as the ofuda disintegrated when it touched his dark 
red skin. &quot;Did you really think that a pathetic ward could stop a being 
of my strength? My power?! DIE WORM!!&quot; the demon bellowed as he charged 
forward, trampling everything in his wake. The concrete floor shook, its 
surface fracturing with every heavy footstep.

Mars cursed and ran, the demon stomping after her, roaring furiously all 
the while. The Fire Senshi ducked as a half finished car sailed over her 
head and crashed into a mountain of oil drums, scattering them like 
bowling pins. Sailor Mars had no idea what she could do. Khairephon 
seemed to be unstoppable. She wished Sailor Mercury were here with her 
mini supercomputer to help find a weak spot on the creature. A weak 
spot... a weakness. Maybe Mars could use the demon&#39;s size against him, 
turning his asset into a disadvantage.

Sailor Mars gasped in shock as something grabbed the back of her long 
coat, lifting her completely off her feet and into the air. She could 
smell sulphur. Sailor Mars turned her head to see that Khairephon had 
snapped her coat up into his mouth and was ready to swallow her entirely 
within his gaping maw. Mars reacted fast and slipped her arms out of her 
coat, falling into a crouch on the floor near the great beast. She 
dashed quickly through his legs and behind him.

Khairephon let her empty coat fall and lashed out at the nimble Mars 
with his tail, but his adversary dove forward and his bony tail swung 
above her with a whoosh of air.

Mars curled into a roll, then turned to face the demon.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars drew her fiery bow and shot an arrow straight into 
Khairephon&#39;s back. The arrow struck the demon and exploded into hot, 
searing flames.

Khairephon growled in annoyance as the fire marginally burnt some muscle 
tissue, his tough hide having only been slightly penetrated by the 
projectile.

Good, Mars thought; she had pissed him off. She leapt onto the main car 
production line and sprinted along the conveyer belts.

Khairephon turned and clomped after her, smashing the conveyers aside or 
simply stomping them flat into the floor as he went.

Mars ran through a large, cube shaped, spray paint machine that was 
surrounded by thick, solid metal on all sides. As she had hoped, 
Khairephon continued his enraged charge and rammed his huge red form 
into the machine trying to get at her.

The Senshi of Fire kept running like crazy, breathing rapidly. She raced 
through the other end of the machine just as Khairephon&#39;s gigantic mouth 
took a chomp at her, his teeth lightly scraping her back. Mars cried out 
and stumbled forward, falling onto her stomach with multiple lacerations 
now marring her back. Despite the pain of her freshest wounds, she 
rolled over and glared into Khairephon&#39;s slanted, narrow, demonic yellow 
eyes. The demon&#39;s torso was wedged tightly in the, now distorted, paint 
machine, with his head and part of his shoulders sticking partially out 
of it.

&quot;Gotcha,&quot; panted Sailor Mars, a ghost of a smirk on her grimy and sweaty 
face.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Khairephon&#39;s reptilian eyes registered shock as Mars fired an arrow of 
flame from where she lay, holding her bow horizontally. The arrow soared 
true piercing one of the demon&#39;s bestial yellow eyes, then bursting 
alight. Khairephon howled in agony as his eye was destroyed and part of 
his brain was cooked.

&quot;NOOOOO!! You can&#39;t! I don&#39;t lose!! I DON&#39;T LOSE!! I NEVER LOSE!!&quot; he 
roared in disbelief and defiance. He thrashed desperately in his metal 
prison, trying to break out of it with brute force.

&quot;First time for everything,&quot; Sailor Mars smiled grimly.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

A second arrow ripped into Khairephon&#39;s other eye--despite him quickly 
closing the eyelid--giving him no chance to escape his confinement in 
the spray paint machine. He screamed an unearthly death cry as the arrow 
detonated, frying the rest of his brain.

As Khairephon&#39;s last sulphurous breath enveloped Sailor Mars--its odour 
almost overwhelming the battered girl--the demon&#39;s huge head collapsed 
onto the conveyer belt and lay still, smoke billowing out of the empty 
eye sockets. As Mars watched, Khairephon&#39;s body turned a sickly green 
and began decaying at a tremendous rate. It was over.

Sailor Mars rolled over and lay back on the conveyer belt, relaxing her 
fatigued and injured body. She had won. She had killed the youma leader, 
Khairephon, and stopped whatever the creatures had been planning to do 
in Yokohama. Sure, there were probably still some youma survivors out 
there, but she doubted they could do any real damage without their 
commander. Mars let out a deep breath, disturbing the wisps of smoke 
coming from Khairephon&#39;s carcass. She had won and she was still alive. 
Sailor Mars didn&#39;t know how she felt about that.

The Senshi of Fire frowned. She still felt that tiny pulling deep inside 
her... that minute call. But Khairephon was dead; there was nothing else 
she was needed for. So why did Sailor Mars still feel the call? She had 
an urge to get up and move, but to where and for what purpose, she had 
no idea.

Sailor Mars was roused from her thoughts by footsteps approaching her 
from the right. She turned her head languidly towards the sound, 
expecting to either see Tsubasa... or the last youma. It was Tsubasa, 
looking a little worse for wear, and someone else was beside him. A 
woman with long dark green hair and dressed in a Sailor Senshi fuku. The 
ornate staff she carried rapped on the floor as she walked purposefully 
towards the miko. Tsubasa and Sailor Pluto came to a stop a few feet 
from Sailor Mars.

&quot;She... she saved me from that other youma,&quot; Tsubasa said, shooting 
nervous looks at the huge rotting corpse of Khairephon.

Sailor Mars gazed up at Sailor Pluto from the conveyer belt, her stomach 
tightening in fear. The Guardian of Time had come to get her... that 
could only mean one thing: Usagi was in some sort of trouble and needed 
Sailor Mars. And not just any trouble; but trouble that was seriously 
dangerous and would threaten her princess&#39;s life.

Pluto first studied Mars&#39; battle weary body for a moment, the faintest 
of creases marring her brow, then took in the raven-haired girl&#39;s 
lifeless, lavender eyes. Sailor Pluto opened her mouth to speak the 
words Sailor Mars already knew were coming and dreaded nevertheless.

&quot;That time has come....&quot; the Senshi of Time said quietly.
