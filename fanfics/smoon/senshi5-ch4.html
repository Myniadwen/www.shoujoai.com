<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 4 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>        Usagi stood there a moment, and Rei was struck by how.. lonely 
the young woman looked. &#39;Of course she&#39;s lonely,&#39; Rei reminded 
herself, &#39;she&#39;s lost so much, her family, the boy she loves.&#39; Without 
thinking she said softly, &quot;We&#39;re ready to help you, Usagi.&quot;

        Usagi smiled slightly, and it was almost like seeing the sun 
rise. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said softly. They began to walk away from what 
was left of the youma and she asked Luna, &quot;What was that youma talking 
about?&quot;

        &quot;There is a prophecy,&quot; Luna said, seemingly reluctant to go 
on. The combined glares of three young women soon spurred her on 
however, &quot;It speaks of a band of champions that would oppose the 
rising of the youma. The Princess out of Shadow, the Seer of Fire, and 
the Wise Woman of Frost are some of those mentioned.&quot;

        &quot;Well, the seer fits me,&quot; Rei said softly, &quot;and Ami could be 
the frost woman. But why would they call Usagi the Princess out of 
shadow?&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Luna admitted quietly, &quot;I was raised for the 
purpose of the fulfillment of the prophecy, but I can&#39;t say that I 
fully understand it.&quot;

        &quot;I guess we&#39;ll find out when we track the leader of the youma 
down,&quot; Usagi said, giving Ami a not so casual glance.

        &quot;Using the data I acquired when you fought Zoisite, I&#39;ve 
confirmed that there is a central location in Tokyo that the youma use 
to transport themselves,&quot; Ami said. &quot;Once we find it, we&#39;ll be able to 
access the youma&#39;s home dimension,&quot; she finished.

        Usagi smiled slightly, &quot;I sense there&#39;s a but in there 
somewhere.&quot;

        Ami smiled back, &quot;But I&#39;ll need the data from at least another 
portal opening, maybe more, before I can narrow down the location with 
any accuracy.&quot;

        &quot;So we get to keep on picking fights with random youma until a 
high ranking one uses a portal to get away,&quot; Rei summarized.

        &quot;Simply put,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;but basically accurate.&quot;

        Usagi looked over at Luna, &quot;Anyone else mentioned by name in 
that prophecy?&quot;

        &quot;Strength of Oak,&quot; Luna volunteered, &quot;and Heart&#39;s Champion are 
the remaining two of the five. The prophecy also speaks of the Four 
who came before, but nothing more detailed.&quot;

        Am odd look crossed Usagi&#39;s face as she heard the first 
description. &quot;Then Strength of Oak will have to be our next recruit,&quot; 
she said firmly.

        &quot;But, how will we find her? Will the magic of the sword help 
us?&quot; Rei blinked in surprise.

        &quot;No,&quot; Usagi actually grinned as she produced a business card 
from her shirt pocket, &quot;I have her phone number.&quot;

        There was an extended moment of surprised silence as the two 
young women and one cat looked over at her oddly.

        &quot;How?&quot; Ami started weakly.

        &quot;I&#39;m not entirely certain that it&#39;s her,&quot; Usagi admitted, &quot;but 
the coincidence is just a bit much, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

        Rei took the card from Usagi&#39;s hand and looked it over. 
&#39;Makoto Kino,&#39; it read simply, a pager number underneath and it was 
decorated with oak leaves. &quot;Makoto,&quot; Rei murmured as if trying to 
remember something, then her eyes grew wide. &quot;Her?!&quot; she said weakly.

        Ami looked between the two of them thoughtfully. &quot;I take it 
she has some reputation?&quot; she finally ventured to ask.

        Rei sighed, &quot;You could say that.&quot;

        In an dark alleyway on the other side of the city, a young man 
cowered against the wall as a pair of bullies rifled through his 
wallet. &quot;Is this all that you have?&quot; the first scowled.

        &quot;Not even enough to pay the toll,&quot; the second smiled 
dangerously as he flexed his hands.

        &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; the bow whimpered, using his bookbag as a 
shield.

        &quot;I&#39;d do what he says,&quot; an cheerful voice startled them from up 
the alley. The two men quickly turned around to see a tall girl 
leaning up casually against the alley wall, looking at them with an 
very amused expression.

        &quot;Don&#39;t interfere, bitch,&quot; the leader growled.

        A much more serious expression crossed her face at that 
remark. &quot;And here I was, just offering you some friendly advice,&quot; 
Makoto shook her head mournfully. Somehow she seemed to disappear from 
the mouth of the alley to reappear right in front of them, grabbing 
the leader by the collar and hoisting him up against the wall with 
surprising ease.

        &quot;Lemme go,&quot; he squeaked out fearfully.

        &quot;AAAH!&quot; the other boy ran forward to swing a pipe down at her 
head, but Makoto just reached back and casually caught it in one hand.

        With frightening suddenness Makoto head-butted the boy that 
she was holding on to, knocking him out cold. She gracefully turned 
even as her leg came up in such a powerful kick that it sent the other 
boy flying into the far wall of the alley with a loud thump!

        &quot;You all right, kid?&quot; Makoto walked over to ask the badly 
shaken young man. He nodded weakly, looking at her with almost as much 
terror as he had the bullies. She casually picked up his wallet and 
handed it back to him as she said more gently, &quot;You&#39;d better get out 
of here before someone comes to check this out.&quot;

        She watched him go just a bit regretfully, as Makoto rather 
liked the shy, intellectual type, then she shook her head firmly. &#39;To 
business,&#39; she thought, and bent down to collect the two bullies 
rather fat wallets. &quot;Not bad,&quot; she murmured aloud at the amount of 
cash they were carrying around, &quot;you&#39;ve been very busy.&quot;

        Makoto took the yen note that was worth the least and wrote on 
it with a black marker, &quot;Don&#39;t mess around in my territory.&quot; 
Underneath she signed it, then pinned it to the leader&#39;s coat. &#39;That 
ought to get the point across,&#39; she thought.

        Makoto nodded to some of the working girls on the corner who 
smiled at her happily. There were no pimps in this part of town, they 
didn&#39;t dare, not with her here. She had broken both the arms of the 
last one to try it, and that had pretty much scared all the others 
away.

        She felt the vibration of her pager, and noted it was a new 
number. Makoto went to the nearest payphone and dialed, waiting a 
moment for it to pick up. The woman&#39;s voice was pleasant, and 
strangely familiar, though Makoto couldn&#39;t quite place it.

        &quot;Yes? You&#39;d like to meet? When and where. Thank you, I&#39;ll see 
you then,&quot; Makoto finished her side of the conversation and put the 
phone down. &quot;Well,&quot; Makoto stretched with a smile, &quot;maybe I&#39;ll get a 
good fight today after all.&quot;

        With that much more cheerful thought in mind Makoto headed off 
down the street with a spring in her step.

        Later that day, three young women and a cat waited rather 
nervously in front of Rei&#39;s shrine. Usagi smiled over at Rei, &quot;Thank 
you for offering this place for our meeting.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Rei smiled back. &#39;Hopefully, this woman 
won&#39;t try something here,&#39; she thought to herself nervously.

        Usagi seemed to pick up on it as she said softly, &quot;I think 
it&#39;ll be all right, Rei. I&#39;ve met her before, and Makoto&#39;s not as bad 
as the stories say.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve met her too?&quot; Ami looked thoughtful. &quot;Interesting, 
likely while fighting youma. Statistically, it seems to me that it&#39;s 
quite improbable that all three of us would merely by chance have been 
attacked by the various youma,&quot; she noted.

        Luna saw the slightly baffled looks on Rei and Usagi&#39;s faces 
and offered, &quot;It&#39;s probably not all a coincidence.&quot;

        &quot;That&#39;s what I said,&quot; Ami smiled.

        Makoto Kino came up the steps with a slight smile on her face, 
wearing a different style of school uniform than Usagi&#39;s. Her long 
brown hair was held back in a ponytail, and her eyes were the deepest 
of forest green. She paused there, studying them intently.

        Makoto&#39;s eyes narrowed as she recognized the slim blonde. 
Usagi had helped her, when a goon she had been fighting had 
transformed into a monster. She still wasn&#39;t sure she had really 
needed the blonde&#39;s help, but it had felt kind on nice fighting beside 
her.

        To one side a woman with long black hair looked at her 
steadily, dressed in the traditional garb of a shrine maiden. Makoto 
frowned slightly, she had heard there was a real miko out here, with 
visions and everything. If this was her, she could be trouble.

        Then the other girl caught Makoto&#39;s eye, and she gulped 
softly. The blue haired woman pushed her glasses up, sitting there 
comfortably in a woman&#39;s suit, almost looking like a school teacher. 
She noticed Makoto&#39;s gaze and looked down, blushing slightly.

        &#39;Kawaii,&#39; Makoto thought with a sigh.

        &quot;Makoto Kino?&quot; Usagi asked with a smile.

        Makoto shook herself, trying to focus on business. &quot;Yes?&quot; she 
asked.

        Usagi smiled, &quot;I&#39;d like to hire you.&quot;
