<h1>Darkness (part 5 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Serena sighed and looked at Rei&#39;s retreating back. She really wanted 
to stay in that position with Rei. But NOOO!! She had to go and train. 
Serena stood to her feet and walked into the bedroom. She picked up 
her clothes from the floor and looked up to see Rei already dressed to 
go. Serena quickly dressed and followed Rei out the door.

The two girls talked animatedly until they reached the huge double 
doors of the training room. Rei opened the door and walked inside to 
see Hotaru in a hand to hand combat with Michelle. Amara was sitting 
in a chair watching.

Amara turned around upon hearing the door shut. She saw Rei and Serena 
and told them that their breakfast was on the table. The two girls 
rushed over and saw two water bottles. They smiled at each other, took 
the bottles and gulped down the red and warm liquid hungrily.

Serena wiped her lips with the back of her hand and walked over to see 
a closer inspection of the fight. Hotaru was doing really well for 
someone who was 4 years old. Serena knew how to fight since she had 
been training with her father and brothers.

Serena stood on the right side of Amara as Rei walked over to the left 
side of the older woman. The three vampires watched the battle which 
soon ended with Hotaru&#39;s body colliding against the floor.

The little girl fell to the floor with a soft thump. Hotaru raised 
herself into a sitting position and rubbed her left cheek as to where 
she had been punched. Michelle walked over and put forth a hand for 
the 4 year old to take.

Hotaru grabbed the hand and let Michelle pull her to her feet. 
Michelle patted the child on the back and said, &quot;good job&quot;. Rei and 
Amara went into a quick hand to hand battle which Rei had lost like 
her sister had.

&quot;Serena I want to fight you.&quot;, said Amara. Amara motioned Serena over 
to the mat and Serena followed. They both crouched down into a 
fighting stance. Michelle sat where Amara had and held Hotaru on her 
lap. Rei leaned against the wall, crossing her arms over her chest. 
Rei fixed her eyes on the oncoming fight, curious in seeing how well 
Serena can fight.

Amara lashed out first with an onslaught of punches and kicks. Serena 
blocked all of them with ease and brought some punches in herself. 
Amara took a step back in surprise before snapping out of her reverie 
to block a kick to the face.

Blows upon blows were thrown into the rumble as Michelle and the two 
ravened haired sisters watched in awe. Serena back flipped her way to 
Amara and jumped up to do a round house kick to the woman&#39;s head.

Amara grabbed Serena&#39;s leg and spun her around and let her go. Serena 
flew into the air and crashed onto the floor with a painful thud. 
Amara stood up straight with her breathing slightly uneven.

Serena laid on the floor for a minute slightly panting. That toss that 
she was dealt really hurt. She felt the left side of her ribs as pain 
shot threw her body rapidly. She let out a little whimper before she 
looked up at Rei.

Rei looked down upon her with worry evident in her eye&#39;s. Her eye&#39;s 
slightly widened and Serena flipped over to be met by Amara&#39;s foot 
come plummeting down onto her sore ribs. Serena cried out in pain as 
Amara kept on beating on her mercilessly.

Serena didn&#39;t understand why nobody was helping her. Serena felt 
herself getting angry and felt her eye beam a blackish red color 
unnoticed by everyone except Rei. Rei straightened up and began to 
fear for Amara. She could feel strange vibes coming from Serena know.

&quot;Amara-papa stop!&quot;, yelled Rei. Amara stopped her blows and looked to 
Rei in confusion. Michelle looked at Rei and then at Serena. Her eyes 
widened at the girls eyes and turned to Amara.

&quot;Amara!! Get away from her now.&quot;, yelled Michelle. Amara looked down 
at Serena and saw the look in the girl&#39;s eyes. It was the scariest 
thing Amara had ever seen and she began to fear for her life.

&#39;Maybe I went a little to far.&#39;, thought Amara as she backed away from 
the girl

Serena was taken over by anger as her focus was aimed at Amara. She 
growled and gave a sickening smirk which revealed her now fully 
exposed fangs. Serena walked casually towards Amara cracking her 
knuckles along the way.

Amara kept walking back as Serena kept on moving forward. Serena 
stopped her walk and then lunged at Amara unexpectedly. Amara taken by 
surprise and didn&#39;t have time to block. Serena&#39;s raised a fist and 
swung full force and it collided with Amara&#39;s face.

Amara flew back and hit the floor with a sickening thud. Amara raised 
herself unsteadily to her feet to be struck down again. Serena was 
completely lost in her anger and one and only thought was to kill 
Amara. Serena gave a little smile that sent shivers up everyone&#39;s 
spines.

She went up to Amara went who was on the ground and attacked the 
woman. Michelle and the two girls watched on in horror as Amara laid 
helplessly on the floor, crying out in pain. Michelle couldn&#39;t take it 
anymore and rushed in to help her lover.

Michelle stealthily came up behind Serena and kicked the back of 
Serena&#39;s head. Serena flew across the room and lay on the floor 
motionless. Michelle bent down and looked over her lover who was in a 
bloody heap.

Hotaru ran over to see if her Amara-papa was okay as Rei stood in 
place watching Serena intently. The silver haired girl laid there as 
if she was dead. Suddenly Serena started twitching and she sat up in a 
sitting position. She lifted a hand and rubbed the back of her head.

Rei noticed that her eyes were the same color and backed up as Serena 
twisted her head towards Michelle.

&quot;Michelle.&quot;, said Rei. The aqua haired woman turned to Rei and saw 
fear in the young girl&#39;s eyes. Michelle slowly turned her head around 
and saw Serena staring at her menacingly. Michelle shivered at the 
look Serena laid upon her.

&quot;You hurt me Michelle. Now you will perish.&quot;, said Serena in a deadly 
whisper. She slowly stood to her feet and lunged at Michelle causing 
them both to tumble to the floor with Serena on top. Serena wrapped 
her little hands around Michelle&#39;s throat and began applying pressure.

Amara saw her lover in distress and quickly went to her aid. Amara got 
to her feet and pulled Serena into the sleeper hold. Serena struggled 
violently and began feeling light headed after a while.

&quot;Shh Serena. Just calm down.&quot;, whispered Amara over and over again in 
the young girl&#39;s ear and applied more pressure onto the girl. Serena 
kept struggling even though her eye&#39;s kept on rolling to the back of 
her head every so often. Everyone watched silently as Serena slowly 
calmed down as Amara began lowering her to the ground.

Soon Serena was out cold and Amara gently laid her to the floor. They 
all sighed with relief an vowed to never get her that angry ever 
again. Training was over for the day as Michelle carried Serena to the 
girl&#39;s bedroom.

Amara, Hotaru and Rei followed closely behind. When they made it to 
the door, Amara opened it and they all walked inside quietly. Michelle 
set Serena down on her bed and walked into the bathroom. Rei and 
Hotaru sat on their respective beds and looked over towards the 
sleeping girl.

Amara sat on the bed where Serena laid and gently rubbed the girls 
back. Michelle entered the room with an first-aid kit in hand. The 
woman silently tended the girl&#39;s wounds and tucked Serena in the bed. 
Amara and Michelle bid their goodnights to the girls and left the 
room.

&quot;That was scary.&quot;, whispered Hotaru. Rei nodded her head in Agreement.

&quot;I just hope I don&#39;t have to see anything like that ever again.&quot;, said 
Rei as she turned out the lights. The two sisters shuffled around in 
their beds until they made themselves comfortable and went to sleep.</pre>
