<h1>Sailor Moon V: The Dark Adventures of the Sailor Scouts (part 12 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tstanton.html">Troy "Silver" Stanton</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/smoonv-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>     The moon shown on the display unit was a small one by cosmic standards,
being about a third the size of Earth&#39;s moon.  Called Nathanya by those who
viewed it in the sky on an almost nightly basis, it was a pale yellow moon that
was for the most part largely nondescript, having only a few distinguishing
features to set it apart from any other moon of similar size and color.
     The video feed seemed to be almost boring as it remained focused on the
miniature moon, doing nothing but watching in complete silence.  The monotony
only lasted for a few moments before the entire moon seemed to shiver for an
instant, a brief and very subtle wobbling motion that would have been easily
overlooked if the focus hadn&#39;t been so intense.
     A dark crack suddenly appeared on the lunar surface, marring the casual
smoothness of the yellow terrain with a jagged line that seemed to ooze thick
red magma from deep within the core.  The moon shivered again, this time for a
little longer than before and added another pair of visible red gashes to the
moon&#39;s previously featureless face.
     &quot;We simply don&#39;t know what is causing the gravity fluctuations,&quot; a very
uneasy voice said in the denizen language.  The words had both a slight slur
and a distinct accent to them, denoting the speaker as one of the conquered
Renn inhabitants.  &quot;Most blame the quantum accident that destroyed our dark
moon Jalandor, but none of the scientists believe this is possible.  Regardless
of the cause, there is growing unease among the population that this phenomenon
is neither transient nor containable.  The surviving World Rangers point to the
death of their High Priestess and the shattering of the WorldStone as proof
that our world will likewise be destroyed and soon.&quot;
     A third tremor rocked the tiny moon, adding yet more magma-oozing cracks
to the surface and giving the impression that it was getting ready to shatter
into fragments at any minute now.  &quot;We expect Nathanya to break up within the
hour,&quot; the voice said in a subdued tone.  &quot;If we assume that the cause is in
fact the quantum experiment that destroyed Jalandor and that it is spreading,
it will take three weeks to reach the moon of Hallas and will not reach the
planet until thirteen weeks after that.
     &quot;However,&quot; the speaker warned ominously, &quot;By that time the moon of Paleste
will have passed near the remains of Nathanya.  Paleste&#39;s gravity well is all
but guaranteed to disturb the debris, and several scientists believe that this
will send a significant number of asteroids and the like towards the homeworld
itself.  Given the odds that we will be struck by multiple fragments that will
be too big to burn up in the atmosphere, I have no illusions as to our chances
of survival in the wake of the utter devastation that will be visited upon us.
     &quot;Therefore, I intend to request an immediate audience with World Governor
Pra&#39;dek and the Red Wing forces, at which point I will urge them to begin a
planetary evacuation of the homeworld&#39;s population to a safe haven through the
dimensional rift, inside their world.  I realize that many of you have branded
me a traitor and have sought my death as punishment for my recent actions, but
you must realize that I am doing this to ensure that we as a species will still
survive this catastrophe.&quot;
     The room was deathly silent as Ar&#39;kanis switched off the recording with a
simple gesture of his hand.  The armored general sighed quietly to himself
before he lifted his head up to look at the bed, making note of the look on
both Nop&#39;tera and Sor&#39;en&#39;s faces.
     &quot;Ar&#39;kanis....&quot; Nop&#39;tera said, her voice barely more than a whisper as she
leaned her head back to rest on the pillow.  Her complexion was unusually pale,
making the skin seem to be a shade of powder-blue.  Her face was clearly etched
with lines of weariness as she continued to recover from the allergic reaction
to the tranquilizer.
     &quot;The drone came through the Hinterland rift twenty minutes ago,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
rumbled quietly, acutely aware of both the early hour of the morning and of how
little sleep both he and Nop&#39;tera had managed to get since they last spoke.
&quot;I felt this was important enough to disturb the both of you.&quot;
     &quot;The entire planet,&quot; Sor&#39;en murmured to herself, slowly shaking her head
as she continued to hold her mother&#39;s hand in a gentle grip.
     &quot;No, the entire star system,&quot; Nop&#39;tera whispered as she closed her eyes.
&quot;Even if it stops now and only Nathanya is destroyed, the debris will end up
bombarding the planet and the other moons sooner or later.  Paleste&#39;s gravity
will see to that,&quot; she pointed out in a weak tone.
     &quot;Can they evacuate the entire planet?&quot; Sor&#39;en inquired in a dubious tone,
giving Ar&#39;kanis a skeptical look.  &quot;I thought they only had a handful of heavy
cruisers left, certainly not enough to shuttle a few billion slugs around.&quot;
     &quot;Enough to form a sustainable and viable colony,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis sighed with a
slow flexing of his draconic wings.
     A muted growl of frustration rose up from Nop&#39;tera&#39;s chest as she opened
her eyes and stared up at the ceiling.  &quot;Damn it, this couldn&#39;t come at a worse
time,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;Ar&#39;kanis, the logistics....&quot;
     &quot;Can be handled by the military,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis interrupted gently.  &quot;That is,
after all, part of their core function.  However, they will need to start the
process now if we are to have a decent chance of success.  If what was said is
correct, then the asteroids will begin to approach the planet in four months.
I would like to have everything ready on our side of the rift in three, just to
be certain.  It will require a lot of work, but I have every confidence that it
can be done in that timeframe.&quot;
     &quot;If the rest of the military will cooperate,&quot; Sor&#39;en pointed out in a dark
tone.  &quot;Right now, I bet they wouldn&#39;t give us the time of day if we asked.&quot;
     &quot;Leave that to me,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said calmly, causing Nop&#39;tera to blink and
make an attempt at sitting up again.  Her body was still well beyond exhausted
from the after-effects of the allergic reaction, however, and so her upper body
only made it a few inches off the sheets before abruptly falling back down with
a soft whumph.
     The gesture didn&#39;t go unnoticed by anyone.  Sor&#39;en immediately looked down
at her mother and frowned, unconsciously gripping her hand tighter.  &quot;Are you
sure you&#39;re alright, Mother?&quot; she asked for the seventh time.
     &quot;Sor&#39;en, if you ask me that one more time....&quot; Nop&#39;tera started to say.
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said softly, causing the dark general to fall silent.
&quot;There is a time when it is best for a leader to hide her pain from her troops
so as not to affect their morale, and there is a time in which being honest to
them is for the greater good.  How bad is it at the moment?&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera looked at him in silence for several moments before casting a
brief glance towards her daughter.  &quot;I can barely move right now,&quot; she admitted
in an almost inaudible whisper, looking away from them.  &quot;It took two days the
last time before I could walk again, and a full week after that before I had my
full strength back.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Sor&#39;en gasped, blinking hard.  &quot;Wait, what happened?&quot;
     &quot;The Dark Kiss of Bliss, Sor&#39;en,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis explained quietly.  &quot;For some
reason, the Chief Medical Officer administered it last night.  What he failed
to realize is that your mother is allergic to it, which results in extreme
weakness of her muscles for several days.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re allergic to that?&quot; Sor&#39;en said, blinking in surprise again as she
regarded her mother with a deeply worried look.
     &quot;Nobody&#39;s immune to everything,&quot; Nop&#39;tera admitted with what might have
been a note of humor and a faint blush of embarrassment on her pale cheeks.
     &quot;In your mother&#39;s case, the drug works all too well,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis added with
a faint gesture.  &quot;She is tranquilized, alright, but just a little harder than
was intended.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s enough, Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; Nop&#39;tera muttered, casting a sidelong glance at
him and wondering what he was up to.  She was privately grateful for the fact
that he hadn&#39;t made the slightest mention of the rather psychotic episode she
had undergone as her body tried to fight off the drug.
     Sor&#39;en glanced at the armored general before returning her ash-gray eyes
to the pale countenance of her mother.  &quot;So what does this mean?&quot; she asked in
an unusually soft tone.
     &quot;That will be discussed very shortly, Brigadier, I assure you,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
said in a neutral tone.  &quot;I will inform you and the rest of the Red Wings once
General Nop&#39;tera and I have come to a suitable understanding.  For the moment,
I think it would be best if you were to oversee the bridge and listen most
carefully for any signs of activity from anyone, be it another drone from the
rift, our sister ships, or the rest of the Negaverse military.  The drone was
broadcasting in the open, so I&#39;m sure everyone who was paying attention is now
aware of the situation in the Hinterlands and will want to ask questions.  If
someone does ask someone else, I want to know who and what.&quot;
     Sor&#39;en blinked and carefully eased off of the bed, not sure what to make
of the formal shift in his tone.  &quot;Understood, sir,&quot; she said as she stood up
straight, still wearing her night-clothes instead of a proper uniform.
     &quot;Sor&#39;en,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said gently, &quot;You need not be overly worried for your
mother&#39;s health or well-being.  Think of it as merely a debilitating headcold,
something that all of us have had at various points in our lives.  Life for the
sufferer will not be pleasant, but it will pass in time.  Your mother will be
back to normal within seven days, I assure you.  Now go change and report to
the bridge, I will be along shortly.&quot;
     &quot;Sir,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied with a crisp salute.  She paused to cast a final
look of daughterly worry towards her mother before she turned and left to go
back to her own quarters.
     Only a keen observer would have been able to discern Nop&#39;tera&#39;s shifting
the focus of her featureless yellow eyes, seeming to narrow just slightly.  She
turned her attention from her departing daughter to Ar&#39;kanis as he strode over
to the control panel on the wall.  A simple tap of an armored fingertip closed
the bedroom door with a soft hiss, and a second tap promptly engaged the lock.
     The air became disturbingly still as he then turned to look at her for a
number of moments in perfect silence.  She hadn&#39;t bothered to get dressed from
earlier and was still completely naked, but the bedsheets and covers provided
enough concealment to ensure that she was in no danger of exposing anything.
     &quot;General Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she finally said after what seemed to be a full minute
of uneasy silence.  &quot;Surely you of all people know how much I dislike being set
up for something.  What precisely do you intend to do?&quot;
     &quot;End this,&quot; the armored figure said quietly, causing Nop&#39;tera to tense up
at the dark chill that suddenly crept down her spine.
     &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; she prodded in a very leery tone, absently tucking the
sheets a little tighter around her.
     A soft sigh echoed out from the confines of his helmet as he looked away
from the bed.  &quot;I want you to give me command of the Red Wings,&quot; he said very
quietly.  &quot;Three days should be enough to accomplish this.  Please, hear me,&quot;
he added as he raised a hand to forestall the expected outburst of questions.
     She stared hard at him for several seconds before she closed her eyes and
tried to relax.  &quot;Again, I&#39;m listening,&quot; she said with a discernible edge, the
corners of her dark blue lips pulled down into a mild scowl.
     &quot;It is a simple statement of fact that you are not fit for duty,&quot; he said
in a calm and level voice.  &quot;Rather than have you relieved on medical grounds,
I ask that you voluntarily yield command.  This will then be explained to the
rest of the V&#39;ral as such, that their general knows she has to rest and is not
afraid to trust her soldiers to protect her during a momentary weakness.  As I
said to Sor&#39;en, it will be no worse than the time you caught the same headcold
that two-thirds of the V&#39;ral fought off during the insurgency of Vul Rein.&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera grunted quietly out of sheer reflex, not needing to be reminded
about how she had suffered over the course of six very long days.  Her immune
system was robust enough to fight off most viral infections, but every now and
then she encountered a bug that was able to linger around long enough to make
her life fairly miserable.  The bug in question had been both quite prolific
and highly mutable, which was why it had lasted as long as it had among the
rest of the crew despite the strict hygienic routines practiced aboard the
ship.
     &quot;That much I understand,&quot; she said carefully.  &quot;But the rest of what you
said, about how you plan on ending this....&quot;
     &quot;By &#39;this&#39; I mean the problem between you and General Rune,&quot; he replied.
&quot;And I believe it can be done without further violence or bloodshed.  I spoke
with Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren after your encounter with Rune and her crystal sword.
The substance of the conversation is not important enough to relate, as she had
her orders from Rune and I had mine from you.  What is important, however, is
that I got the impression that she is nobody&#39;s fool and can be reasoned with.
     &quot;What I intend to do is leave Sor&#39;en in command of the V&#39;ral while I use
one of our remaining aircraft to fly over to the Imperial Castle to meet with
Admiral Si&#39;ren in person for a very frank face-to-face discussion.  The intent
will be to avert a war between us, or more precisely, between you and Rune.  If
she and I can come to an agreement, then I will return here with the intention
of persuading you to accept the terms as negotiated while she does the same
with General Rune.&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera&#39;s eyes promptly snapped open to stare at the ceiling.  She then
tilted her head slightly to regard him very carefully in silence.  &quot;The terms
as negotiated, Ar&#39;kanis?&quot; she finally echoed in a soft tone that revealed very
little of what she might be thinking.  &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, I might think
that you intend on selling me out.&quot;
     &quot;Diplomacy, my general, means you don&#39;t always get everything that you
want from the other party,&quot; he said in a distinctly cold tone.  &quot;Or do you have
so little faith left in me that you think I would negotiate our surrender to
General Rune?&quot;
     &quot;Of course not,&quot; she murmured with a sigh as she closed her eyes again.
She almost opened them again as she heard the soft rasping and clanking of his
heavy armor as he crossed the room.  The metallic noises continued for a brief
moment even after his footsteps stopped, followed by a soft creaking noise as
a weight was settled onto the corner of the bed.  She was about to open her
eyes to see what he was doing when she felt a warm hand lightly caressing her
cheek, moments before his lips brushed against hers in an unmistakable gesture.
     It was only through sheer force of will that she managed to keep her eyes
closed, realizing that it meant that he had taken his helmet off in order to
kiss her.  That he was doing so was surprising enough to shock her into near-
total paralysis, able to do little more than yield to the unexpected warmth and
depth of the intimate gesture.
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera,&quot; he murmured very softly once their lips parted, the timbre of
his unhelmeted voice sending a tingle down her spine.  &quot;Have you no trust in me
anymore?  I would do anything for you, anything at all, and only ask for your
acknowledgment of my service in return.  What I seek is to save you from all
this, to save everyone from this.&quot;
     &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she asked quietly.  She felt the weight from the bed
disappear and heard a soft rasping noise, causing her to hesitate for a moment
before opening her eyes to look at him.  He was still standing next to the bed
but had just finished locking his helmet back into place, sparing her the sight
of seeing his face again.  Her blood promptly turned to slush as she caught a
glimpse of his ungloved hand, quickly averting her gaze as she did her best to
keep her expression from changing.
     &quot;There can be no good coming from a conflict between you and Rune,&quot; he
pointed out, the acoustics of his helmet once again masking his voice with a
chilling sepulchral echo.  &quot;Such in-fighting is of no benefit to anyone, least
of all the ones directly involved.  What we need now is a unified military, one
that can work together efficiently to deal with the crisis that appears to be
brewing in the Hinterlands.  We both know why you picked General Pra&#39;dek to be
your overseer while you returned to the Negaverse, and we both know how he will
react to this threat.  He will do what he can to save as many Renn as possible,
and in turn we must be ready to do our part to help him.  That cannot be done
if we are too busy fighting amongst ourselves.&quot;
     She waited until she was absolutely sure that he had put his armored glove
back on before turning to look at him again.  &quot;And you really think you can do
this, Ar&#39;kanis?&quot; she inquired softly with just a hint of dry sarcasm to her
voice.  &quot;Settle matters in three days and make us all one big happy family?&quot;
     &quot;I believe I can reach an accord with Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; he replied in a
calm tone.  &quot;Or at least reach a mutual understanding.  What comes after that,
however, all depends on how much influence she has on General Rune.  I have no
idea if she can be persuaded or not, but I am fairly confident that I will be
able to get you to understand the situation from my perspective once I return
to the V&#39;ral and have a chance to discuss it with you.&quot;
     &quot;Really, now,&quot; she said in a flat tone, giving him an unamused look that
was bordering on being unfriendly.
     Ar&#39;kanis froze in mid-motion before turning to regard her very carefully.
&quot;Are you implying you will not listen to me?&quot; he inquired in a studious tone.
&quot;Or that you have no desire to be open to compromise, or even understanding?
If that is the case, my general, then you disappoint me greatly.&quot;
     It took Nop&#39;tera a moment to get her temper under control, the edges of
her lips unconsciously curling back to expose her vampiric fangs.  &quot;Ar&#39;kanis,
with as much as I value your counsel and services, I do not appreciate being
maligned like that,&quot; she warned him in a low tone.  &quot;I seek an end to this just
as much as you do, but it will be on my terms and not General Rune&#39;s.&quot;
     &quot;And do you not think I will seek to arrange that?&quot; the armored general
replied quietly.  &quot;I will be honest, my general, there are probably a few minor
points I will have to yield on or otherwise allow Si&#39;ren to have, but I assure
you that it is very likely that you will find the end result to be largely to
your satisfaction.  Unless, of course, you do not see things as I see them,
which is entirely possible as we are both individuals.  Regardless, I have a
duty both to you and to the Negaverse military that I swore an oath to serve to
do my best to see this resolved as swiftly as possible and for the greater good
of the Negaverse.  Surely you understand this, my general.&quot;
     &quot;I do, Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she sighed as she closed her eyes, trying to ignore the
feeling of utter helplessness at the moment.  Her body was still too weakened
to respond properly, making it difficult to even lift her head up.  She knew it
would pass in a day or two, but that didn&#39;t help her mood in the slightest.
     &quot;Then if you will excuse me, my general, there is much to be done,&quot; he
rumbled quietly as he reached for the door lock.  He paused as he suddenly
remembered something and cast a sidelong glance at her.  &quot;You will, I trust,
yield command of the Red Wings until your convalescence is complete?&quot; he asked
in an uncharacteristically wary tone.
     A silent growl of frustration rose up from Nop&#39;tera&#39;s chest.  &quot;I will,&quot;
she finally said after several seconds of silence.  &quot;However, I ask that you do
not make me regret it, Ar&#39;kanis.  It is bad enough I feel absolutely useless at
the moment, I don&#39;t need to be adding remorse to the situation.&quot;
     &quot;Honestly, my general, when have I ever not tried to do so?&quot; he pointed
out with just a faint hint of humor to the otherwise chilled echo of his tone.
     &quot;You know what I mean,&quot; she grumbled quietly with another soft sigh.  She
paused as she heard the near-silent tap of his fingertip against the panel and
the equally quiet sound of the locks being withdrawn.  &quot;Ar&#39;kanis....&quot; she said
on pure impulse as the memory of what was said last night resurfaced.
     &quot;My general?&quot; he inquired.
     She absently chewed on the edge of her lip before she decided there wasn&#39;t
too much to lose at this point and drew in a deep breath.  &quot;About the storage
pool at Hannshok....&quot;  She waited to see if he would say anything, feeling a
faint chill forming in her abdomen as he remained perfectly silent.  &quot;If you
really knew all this time.... why didn&#39;t you ever say anything?&quot;
     &quot;Does it truly matter?&quot; he inquired softly.  &quot;Or rather, do you want it to
matter?&quot;
     A slightly uncomfortable silence descended around the room as they both
remained quiet, briefly lost in their own thoughts and memories of what had
happened during the V&#39;ral&#39;s maintenance cycle at the Renn seaport of Hannshok.
As water was not an overly abundant commodity aboard the airborne carriers, it
was a very rare luxury for anyone to soak in a bath instead of using the more
water-conserving showers for personal hygiene and relaxation.  Someone had come
up with the idea of using the storage pools for recreation given the fact that
the coolant units had to be taken off-line for several days and their contents
had already been relocated elsewhere for the duration.  That had led to five
days of almost non-stop usage by the crew, much to everyone&#39;s delight.  There
had initially been rules of decorum and conduct in mixed company, but that had
lasted for maybe seven hours before quietly being flushed down the drain by 
unspoken consensus, resulting in more than a few stories that would be told in
quiet whispers among friends for weeks afterwards.
     The storage pools had been officially closed at midnight on the day before
they were to be serviced and restored to operation, and as expected the area
only became completely vacated an hour later.  Only then did Ar&#39;kanis quietly
and unobtrusively enter the chamber to make use of the pool in solitude, having
reached a quiet arrangement with the Engineering staff.  The situation took on
an entirely new facet when the lights suddenly shut off, leaving the pool in
absolute darkness.  The door slid open a few moments later, allowing someone
else to enter the room with him.  His unknown guest then stepped into the pool
after a brief delay to discard her clothes, and it soon became obvious that she
wasn&#39;t there to soak in the water....
     &quot;Ar&#39;kanis....&quot; Nop&#39;tera said softly.
     &quot;The way I see it,&quot; he interrupted gently, &quot;I was not meant to know.  That
I did know was therefore unintentional, and I saw no need to spoil anything.
Sometimes a valid reason is not required for some things.  I felt that was one
of them, and so I never asked for a reason nor bothered to seek one out.&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera wasn&#39;t sure what to say, feeling a chill inside as she thought
about what it all meant.  She was still struggling to find something meaningful
to say when the door hissed open without warning, allowing Freya to enter the
bedroom carrying a small insulated container.
     &quot;Oh!&quot; the pale-haired woman gasped as she almost ran into Arkanis, taking
a quick step back and clutching the cylinder tightly.
     &quot;Easy, Freya,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said as she opened her eyes to look at her slave.
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Freya breathed as the worst of the shock wore off, leaving a
pale blush of embarrassment on her cheeks.  &quot;I saw Sor&#39;en in the corridor just
a few moments ago and thought you had left as well.&quot;
     A muted chuckle of amusement rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39;s chest.  &quot;I will be
leaving in a few moments as well, unless General Nop&#39;tera has anything further
to discuss.&quot;
     &quot;Not at the moment, Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said quietly.
     &quot;Then if you will excuse me....&quot; he started to say.
     &quot;One moment,&quot; Freya said quickly.  &quot;Medical asked me to pass along to you
that M&#39;s nerve structures have finished reforming, but that she appears to be
in a sort of regenerative-sleep mode.  They expect her to show some signs of
consciousness within a few hours.&quot;
     &quot;M?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis echoed with a slight hint of confusion.
     &quot;Our stowaway metamorph,&quot; Nop&#39;tera spoke up as her mood shifted.  &quot;She met
with me earlier to discuss a few things about Earth.  It will be interesting to
hear what she has to say about why she tried to come onboard,&quot; she mused.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied with a nod.  &quot;I was told of her nature, although I
was not told her name.  I will keep you informed of any new developments,&quot; he
promised Nop&#39;tera.
     &quot;I also found out what happened to your medical records,&quot; Freya continued
with an absent gesture of the insulated container.  &quot;Do you remember the time
the computer core was partially damaged a few years ago and they had to reload
some of the data by hand?&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera blinked in surprise and tilted her head to exchange surprised
looks with Ar&#39;kanis.  &quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;I thought the only data
we lost had to do with maintenance and Engineering records?&quot;
     &quot;One of the data nodes that held a portion of the medical records was also
corrupted,&quot; Freya explained.  &quot;Your record was one of them.  They were able to
reload it using the physical copy stored in the medical vault, but it seems
that a page was somehow overlooked.  The Chief Medical Officer wishes to assure
you that he will order a physical review of all the records for missing data,
and has.... asked for your forgiveness,&quot; she said as she came over to the bed
and set the container down next to Nop&#39;tera.
     Nop&#39;tera sighed quietly as she was helped into a sitting position, once
again cursing the severe muscle weakness that was plaguing her.  The sheets
would have tumbled into her lap to expose her if it wasn&#39;t for a last-second
realization of her state of undress, prompting a hasty grab just as the top
sheet started to slide away.  She cast a look of faint embarrassment at the
armored figure by the door before she turned to look at the cylinder Freya was
opening for her.
     &quot;Oh, my,&quot; the blue-skinned vampire purred as she was greeted with both the
sight and smell of freshly-drawn dark green blood.  &quot;I think he&#39;s quite serious
about this one.  Not that I doubt he would be, given his dedication to his
work, but still, this is a little.... unexpected.  His, no doubt?&quot;
     &quot;He had me draw it for him,&quot; Freya said quietly, casting a glance down at
the slightly-steaming contents.  &quot;It hasn&#39;t even been five minutes yet, and it
has been kept at a constant temperature.&quot;
     &quot;Mmm, breakfast in bed....&quot; Nop&#39;tera said demurely with a soft smile.  She
looked up as Ar&#39;kanis coughed quietly to himself, one delicate white eyebrow
arching up as she regarded him carefully.  &quot;Something wrong, Ar&#39;kanis?&quot; she
inquired casually.
     &quot;I need to report to the bridge,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said calmly.  &quot;As I said, we
will need as much time as we can muster and there is much to do now.  Or do you
seek an audience for your.... breakfast in bed?&quot; he added, echoing her words
with just enough dryness in his tone to let her know that it wasn&#39;t the blood
that was making him slightly uncomfortable.
     &quot;I expect you to keep me informed of any developments,&quot; she said to him as
she picked up the container.  Her eyes never left his as she swirled it around
gently before bringing it to her lips, taking a careful sip of the emerald
nectar.  It was several degrees warmer than normal body temperature, which only
made the flavor all the more pungent.
     &quot;Breakfast indeed,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis observed with open amusement as he watched
the vampire promptly down half the contents within the span of a few seconds.
&quot;Or have you been neglecting to take care of yourself since our arrival in the
Negaverse, as I am starting to suspect is the case?&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera paused to lick her lips, giving him a look of patient suffering.
&quot;We&#39;ve all been busy these past few days, Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she said in a tone that
was somehow both apologetic and reproving at the same time.
     &quot;Freya, see that she is properly fed,&quot; the armored general instructed in
a bemused tone.  &quot;Her body has been subjected to a great deal of stress as of
late and has probably used up her energy reserves trying to regenerate what it
can.  Let me know if a few more volunteers are needed.&quot;
     &quot;General Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said crisply, &quot;Might I remind you that I&#39;ve
been managing my blood intake quite successfully on my own for well over five
thousand years now?&quot;
     A quiet chuckle emerged from the depths of his helmet.  &quot;Then with all due
respect, my general, quit drinking like a dehydrated man being given a bottle
of water,&quot; he observed as he made a gesture to the container of blood.
     Nop&#39;tera paused and glanced down, blinking hard as she saw that she had
somehow managed to empty it without realizing it.  &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; she sighed
softly, casting a glance over at Freya.  Her slave remained perfectly silent,
but there was a pale blush on her cheeks that spoke volumes in of itself.
     &quot;I will deliver a status report to you later, my general,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said
with a slight bow of his head.  He had turned to leave and was halfway through
the bedroom door when he heard Nop&#39;tera call his name quietly, causing him to
pause and glance back.
     &quot;One final question, if I may,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said in a very quiet tone, her
featureless yellow eyes remaining focused on the faint traces of green left in
the empty container.  &quot;The storage pool.  How did you know?&quot;
     &quot;There is a saying,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly as he returned his gaze to
the main living room.  &quot;Even the smallest candle shines like a beacon when in
absolute darkness.  Fair morning, my general,&quot; he said before he left, allowing
the door to quietly hiss shut behind him.
     It took Nop&#39;tera a few seconds to realize what he meant, and it took even
longer for her to quit berating herself for overlooking a detail such as that.
How long had she mulled it over when the thought came to her, how much effort
had she put into setting everything up just right, and how much of a fool had
she been for thinking she had successfully kept it secret only to be told long
after the fact that she had given herself away almost immediately back then?
Worse, everything that he had said and done after that now had to be viewed in
a different light simply because he had been aware of it the entire time....
     Her focus snapped back to reality as Freya gently pried the empty cylinder
from her hands, almost causing her to hit the ceiling.  &quot;Are you alright?&quot; she
whispered very softly as she noticed that Nop&#39;tera was no longer obviously lost
in introspective thought.
     &quot;I was,&quot; the dark general admitted frankly, causing her pale-haired slave
to blink hard.  &quot;I think Ar&#39;kanis has a point, I honestly can&#39;t remember how
long it&#39;s been since I had that much blood.  It seemed to have helped, though,
so I might have to ask Medical to thaw a pouch or two for me.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure we can arrange for a live donation,&quot; Freya said softly.
     &quot;Maybe once I can move properly,&quot; Nop&#39;tera sighed as she glanced down at
the sheets.  She discovered that she could wiggle her toes now, but it required
a great amount of focus to do so.  &quot;Until then, however.... well, it&#39;s not like
I have anything else to do now,&quot; she grumbled as she tried to lay back down.
&quot;Ar&#39;kanis has command for a few days and he&#39;s going to see if he can sit down
with Admiral Si&#39;ren to work something out.  Sor&#39;en will have the bridge, which
she&#39;ll just love,&quot; she added with a weak rolling of her eyes.  &quot;But then again,
seeing how her fighter wing is parked in some open field, I doubt that she has
much else to do either.  This is not turning out to be a pleasant homecoming,&quot;
she sighed wistfully.
     Freya reflexively winced as Nop&#39;tera suddenly belched, causing a truly
dark blush to appear on the denizen vampire&#39;s cheeks.  &quot;I think you drank that
too quickly,&quot; Freya pointed out in an embarrassed tone.  She then had to blink
rapidly to retain her vision as the fumes reached her nose, causing her eyes to
start to water.
     &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; Nop&#39;tera coughed as her own tear-ducts likewise started
to react.  &quot;This is *not* how I wanted to start my day.  I&#39;m going to try to go
back to sleep.  If the rest of today is going to be like this, don&#39;t bother
trying to wake me up until at least lunch.&quot;
     &quot;Not if you react to lunch the same way you just did to breakfast,&quot; Freya
murmured very softly in a rare moment of dry humor.
     &quot;Thank you, Freya,&quot; Nop&#39;tera sighed heavily, wondering just how long the
day was going to turn out.  If recent events were any indication of things to
come, however, it was likely going to be a really long one....

                *               *               *               *

     Serena didn&#39;t sit down at her desk so much as plop down, quite obviously
not fully awake yet.  She was still on-time, however, and even had a full ten
minutes to spare before class began, which was unusual enough on a Monday to
cause most of the class to exchange assorted glances and quiet whisperings.
     &quot;Morning, Serena,&quot; Molly ventured in a cautious tone as she studied the
look on her best friend&#39;s face.  She couldn&#39;t help the smile that crossed her
face as she was answered with a very fuzzy grunting-moan of reluctance that
said far more than any coherent words could have.  &quot;New alarm clock?&quot;
     &quot;Mom found out how to turn up the volume,&quot; Serena muttered quietly as she
tried valiantly to stave off a yawn.
     That caused Molly to pause for a moment.  &quot;Huh,&quot; she said thoughtfully.
&quot;Odd, I thought you could sleep through anything....&quot;
     &quot;The alarm clock wasn&#39;t what woke me up,&quot; Serena sighed.  &quot;What happened
was the volume was loud enough to spook Luna, who of course panicked and began
to claw everything around her.&quot;
     &quot;Ouch,&quot; the redhead winced in sympathy.  &quot;So where did she claw you?&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; Serena replied in a voice as flat as paved concrete.
     Molly chuckled quietly and reached out to pat Serena&#39;s shoulder.  Her hand
hadn&#39;t made contact yet when Melvin seemed to pop up between them without any
warning whatsoever, already opening his mouth to say something.  His arrival
caught both girls by complete surprise, resulting in a very shrill scream from
Serena and a reflexive swat of panic from Molly that sent him tumbling across
the floor.
     &quot;Hey, girls, guess whaAAAAAHHHH!!!&quot;
     &quot;Ooh,&quot; a freckled girl with a cherubic face winced as Melvin came to a
halt at her feet.  &quot;You really need to be careful about sneaking up on people
like that.  You okay?&quot;
     &quot;Ergh,&quot; Melvin groaned as he sat up and readjusted his glasses.  &quot;I&#39;m
okay, Willow, thanks.&quot;
     &quot;Melvin, don&#39;t DO that!&quot; Molly called out once she recovered her wits.
&quot;You about scared the bejeebers out of us.&quot;
     &quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Melvin said as he stood up and dusted himself off.
     &quot;Okay,&quot; Serena said quietly in a voice pitched a full octave higher than
was normal, &quot;I think I&#39;m awake now.  Honest.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s good, Serena,&quot; Melvin said as she approached them again.  &quot;You&#39;re
going to love this one.  I just got a note from my source in the main office
about....&quot;
     &quot;Melvin?&quot; Molly said in a weary tone, cutting him off with a sharp gesture
of her arm that caused half the room to tense up with the expectation that she
was going to swat him again.  &quot;It&#39;s not even seven-thirty in the morning, and
it&#39;s a Monday morning at that.  The gossip can wait.&quot;
     &quot;Not this one,&quot; Melvin said, lowering his voice.  The somewhat dramatic
shift in his mood caused the part of the room that was listening to him to very
casually lean closer, not wanting to miss out on whatever juicy piece of gossip
he was about to impart.  &quot;We&#39;re getting a new student today, and she&#39;s being
assigned to this room.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; both Molly and Serena said in the same moment, sitting up just a
little straighter in their chairs.
     Melvin nodded sagely, feeling pleased with himself yet again as he took
their reactions to mean they wanted him to continue.  &quot;We think she&#39;s a foreign
exchange student, possibly from Europe,&quot; he babbled quietly.
     &quot;Wow, that sounds like.... uh, Serena?&quot; Molly said as she glanced over at
the long-haired blonde.  She blinked as she noticed the expression on Serena&#39;s
face as she looked at something behind Melvin, clearly not paying attention to
what Molly was trying to say to her.  Curious, she turned around to see if she
could spot what had grabbed Serena&#39;s somewhat flighty attention-span this time.
     Melvin likewise craned his neck around and almost fell over on the spot.
&quot;That *has* to be her,&quot; he whispered very softly to the other girls, oblivious
to the fact that Molly&#39;s jaw was slightly unhinged and that both Serena and
Molly&#39;s eyes were fairly wide.
     The young girl standing hesitantly just inside the doorway was about as
beautiful as a woman her age could get without resorting to cosmetics.  Her
skin was a milky white color and appeared to be utterly flawless.  Her braided
hair was an even paler shade of white, giving her the appearance of being cast
out of glass.  Her eyes were a very soft shade of cream yellow, seeming to be
studying the occupants of the room with reserved curiosity.
     &quot;Wow....&quot; Serena breathed quietly in awe.  &quot;She&#39;s pretty.&quot;
     &quot;Definitely a foreign exchange student,&quot; Molly agreed somberly.
     &quot;Maybe she&#39;s Canadian,&quot; Melvin suggested.  &quot;I understand they don&#39;t get a
lot of sunlight during the winters.  Either that or she&#39;s really a ghost.&quot;
     Serena and Molly just looked at him in open disbelief that he had actually
uttered something that stupid.  &quot;No,&quot; Molly said very slowly.  &quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot;
     &quot;Huh?&quot; Melvin said as he turned to look at her with a questioning look.
&quot;What makes you say that?&quot;
     &quot;Women&#39;s intuition, Melvin,&quot; Molly said calmly, resisting the urge to
either roll her eyes or make a good-faith effort at slapping the stupidity out
of him.  &quot;That, and ghosts don&#39;t enroll in schools.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, I guess you&#39;re right,&quot; the gossip-king admitted as he turned back
to stare at the new student some more.
     The girl&#39;s eyes continued to sweep across the room before her gaze fell on
Serena, producing an almost electrical sensation in the blonde&#39;s blood as she
sat up straight.  It seemed that the new arrival was about to say something
when she blinked and cast a startled glance behind her, quickly moving aside to
let the teacher enter the room.
     &quot;Ahh, Ms. Azmodan, I presume?&quot; he said cordially as he headed over to his
desk and set his briefcase down.
     &quot;I am,&quot; the girl replied in a soft, almost musical voice that immediately
reminded Serena of how her own voice sounded when her denizen side was showing.
The sudden reminder of the recent emergence of her hybrid blood made her look
around the room in acute unease, having very strong doubts yet again about how
she was going to keep her angelic nature a secret from everyone else.  That she
was Sailor Moon was easy to hide, as it took a deliberate effort to transform
and thus couldn&#39;t just slip out when she was distracted.  But if someone like
Ami, who certainly had a greater focus of mind than she did, could occasionally
let her darker side show without realizing it....
     &quot;I don&#39;t have assigned seats, so just have a seat wherever you like,&quot; the
teacher said, snapping Serena out of her brief reverie.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; the girl said with a faint smile as she quickly scanned the
room once again.  Her gaze settled on Serena after a brief moment before she
started to move towards her, carefully threading her way between the rows of
occupied desks.  &quot;Is this taken?&quot; she asked softly as she pointed to the empty
desk on Serena&#39;s left.
     &quot;Uh, no,&quot; Serena replied after a momentary hesitation.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; the girl said as she slipped between the desks to set her
backpack down and sit in the chair.  &quot;I&#39;m Lily.  What&#39;s your name?&quot;
     &quot;Serena,&quot; the long-haired blonde replied, trying to figure out just why
she was experiencing a slight anxiety attack all of a sudden.  What gives? she
thought as she tried to clear her mind.  I never had this problem meeting new
people before.  Especially when they&#39;re pretty like she is....
     &quot;I like what you&#39;ve done with your hair,&quot; Lily said quietly, snapping the
blonde out of her thoughts.  &quot;It&#39;s definitely unique.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, umm, thank you,&quot; Serena stammered in reply.  She nearly leapt out of
her school uniform when Molly poked her in the shoulder, whipping around in a
slight panic to see the redhead giving her a very concerned look.
     &quot;Serena, you alright?&quot; Molly inquired carefully.  &quot;You seem awfully jumpy
this morning.  I mean, I know it&#39;s Monday and all, but still.  Hi, I&#39;m Molly,&quot;
she added as she leaned slightly to the side to look at Lily.
     &quot;Hello,&quot; Lily said with a fairly warm smile.
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry, it&#39;s just.... one of those days already,&quot; Serena spoke up with
a weak laugh.
     &quot;Time to switch to sugarless gum,&quot; Molly said dryly.
     &quot;Oh, come on, I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; Serena protested sourly.
     &quot;You know, Serena,&quot; Melvin spoke up, &quot;I can probably get you a good deal
on sugarless gum.  I&#39;ve got a friend on the Internet who sells such things, and
the cost of shipping is really cheap....&quot;
     &quot;Melvin?&quot; Molly said in a tone of patient suffering.  &quot;Go sit down, it&#39;s
almost time for class to start.&quot;
     Melvin immediately checked the wall clock and blinked.  &quot;Oooh, thanks,&quot; he
squeaked as he bolted for his desk.  He managed to sit down with precisely two
seconds to spare before the bell sounded, signaling the official start of the
morning class.
     &quot;Good Monday morning, everyone,&quot; the teacher said in an overly cheerful
tone, prompting a slew of quiet grunts and moans at the reminder.  &quot;Yeah, tell
me about it,&quot; he chuckled.  &quot;Anyway, before we begin, I&#39;d like to introduce our
newest student to you.  Everyone, meet Lilibeth Azmodan.  Correct me if I&#39;m
wrong, but I believe you hail from Glen Haven in Nova Scotia?&quot;
     &quot;I do,&quot; Lily replied with a faint smile.
     &quot;Great,&quot; the teacher said before he paused and cast a quick glance around
the room.  &quot;Okay, pop quiz,&quot; he said, causing most of the class to blanch in
pure reflex.
     &quot;Canada,&quot; Melvin piped up.
     &quot;Correct,&quot; the teacher said after only a slight hesitation, giving him a
distinctly nonplussed look.  &quot;And the county?&quot;
     &quot;Halifax,&quot; Melvin promptly replied.
     &quot;Geek check,&quot; someone muttered quietly, causing a muted outburst of muted
giggles and chuckles.
     Molly sighed quietly and unobtrusively leaned over to Serena.  &quot;I hate it
when he does that,&quot; she muttered under her breath.
     Serena cast a quick sidelong glance at her best friend before leaning over
as well.  &quot;Who, the teacher or Melvin?&quot; she whispered.
     &quot;Both,&quot; Molly grumbled.
     &quot;So much for the geography quiz,&quot; the teacher said dryly, causing a few
of the students to applaud.  &quot;Yes, thank you.  Anyway, welcome to Tokyo, Ms.
Azmodan, hopefully you&#39;ll find it to be as delightful as Glen Haven is.  Now,
if everyone would be so kind as to pull out your homework from the weekend and
pass it up to the front, we can get things started.&quot;
     &quot;Typical,&quot; Molly sighed as she opened up her backpack to fish out her
homework folder.  &quot;Serena, please tell me you did yours this time,&quot; she asked
in a low tone, casting a slightly worried glance out of the corner of her eye.
     &quot;Right here,&quot; the blonde replied as she held up the completed assignment.
     &quot;Finally decided to start the week out right, eh?&quot; Molly teased her as she
leaned forward to pass her assignment up to Willow.  &quot;Thanks.&quot;
     &quot;Hope you did better than I did,&quot; Willow sighed as she briefly eyeballed
what Molly had written before stacking her own assignment on top and passing
them both up the line.
     Serena sighed as she remembered how both Luna and Susan had teamed up to
gently prod and coerce her into finishing the assignment.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say I
had a few people encouraging me,&quot; she muttered to Molly.  She paused as an icy
trickle slid down her back for no discernible reason, casting a glance around
the room.  It took her a moment to realize that her chest felt slightly odd.
A quick and reflexive motion of her hand assured her that the brooch holding
the Imperium Silver Crystal was both securely closed and still pinned to the
front of her uniform.
     She let out her breath quietly, then chided her for having held it in the
first place.  Yeesh, settle down, she told herself as she glanced around the
room again.  It&#39;s not like there&#39;s ever been a problem with it before.  I mean,
it&#39;s never popped open by accident or fell off or anything.  So why am I so
jumpy all of a sudden?  Maybe Molly&#39;s right about the sugar.... huh?
     She blinked as the odd sensation in her chest returned, causing her to
reach up and touch the brooch again.  It felt unusually warm to her before it
abruptly cooled back down to room temperature, happening so quickly that it
made her wonder if she had simply imagined the feeling.  Oh, now what is going
on? she thought to herself as a feeling of unease wrapped around her.
     &quot;Serena,&quot; Molly said very quietly.  She then flinched as the blonde made
a startled squeaking noise that was clearly audible, causing the majority of
the class to turn around.  &quot;Gezundheit,&quot; she said loudly.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Serena said, quickly rubbing her nose.
     Molly let out a silent sigh of relief as the class immediately went back
to whatever they had been doing, figuring that it had simply been an aborted
sneeze.  &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re okay?&quot; she murmured once she was sure that the
coast was clear.
     &quot;It&#39;s.... been a long weekend,&quot; Serena replied hesitantly.
     &quot;Yeah, I know what you mean,&quot; Molly nodded in understanding.
     No, you don&#39;t, Serena found herself thinking as her mind flashed back to
what had taken place since school had let out on Friday.  First the meeting
with Susan, Alex, and Michelle, then the various fights between individuals,
Rei&#39;s brief resignation as a Sailor Scout, the slow emergence of her denizen
side, the fight with Darian, the confrontation with Jedyt, being kidnapped and
taken into the Negaverse as she fought for her life against the Chaos Factor,
the foggy memories of confronting Rune and watching Darian die, feeling her own
life finally slip free from her body only to be called back by Rei, her sudden
transformation into a denizen angel, making up with Darian, surrendering her
virginity to him the following night, learning that there were more than a few
problems with the Imperium Silver Crystal....
     &quot;Good job, everyone,&quot; the teacher said, abruptly refocusing her on her
immediate surroundings.  &quot;Of course, we won&#39;t know until tomorrow just how good
you really did, but at least everyone turned in something which is a bit of an
improvement in of itself.  Now then, let&#39;s pick up where we left off on Friday,
shall we?&quot;
     &quot;So another long week begins,&quot; Molly sighed softly.
     &quot;It&#39;s looking to be that way,&quot; Serena agreed as she cast a quick glance
over her shoulder at Lily.  She noticed that the new arrival already had her
textbook out but seemed to be uncertain where the class was.  &quot;We&#39;re on page
fifty-five,&quot; Serena quietly said to her.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lily replied with a grateful smile.  &quot;You&#39;re an angel.&quot;
     It took the blonde a considerable effort not to react to the comment,
instead managing to force a weak smile on her face at the pretty girl.  &quot;I
wouldn&#39;t say that,&quot; she said carefully.
     &quot;Maybe,&quot; the other girl said demurely, her pale yellow eyes giving her a
very studious look.  &quot;I know a kind-hearted person when I meet one.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Serena replied after a slight hesitation.  A somewhat booming
cough from the front of the classroom got her attention, causing her to look up
to find the teacher giving her a reproving look.
     &quot;What seems to be the problem, Ms. Tsukino?&quot; he inquired warily.
     &quot;Umm, I....&quot; Serena started to say.
     &quot;She is helping me find the right page,&quot; Lily spoke up, her musical voice
turning the head of every single boy in the classroom.
     &quot;Ah, I see,&quot; the teacher replied, nodding his head in understanding.
&quot;We&#39;re not too far into the chapter, so catching up shouldn&#39;t require too much
effort.  I&#39;m sure Ms. Tsukino can give you a condensed version of what we&#39;ve
covered so far.... after class,&quot; he added with noted emphasis.
     Serena and Lily briefly exchanged looks before nodding to one another.
&quot;Thank you,&quot; Lily said to the teacher with a faint smile.  &quot;We&#39;ll do that.&quot;
     &quot;Great,&quot; the teacher said as he turned back to his own textbook and began
the morning&#39;s lesson.
     Willow cast a furtive glance at Serena before discreetly leaning back.
&quot;How does she keep making friends that easily?&quot; she grumbled to Molly.
     Molly just shook her head in resignation.  &quot;It must be a blonde thing,&quot;
she whispered back sourly.  She knew that Willow had a hard time finding good
friends because of her chubby appearance and introverted tendencies, but that
still didn&#39;t have anything to do with the apparent ease at which Serena made
friends with people who otherwise showed little social interest.  Both Ami and
Leda came to mind, the former being a somewhat shy bookworm and the latter an
aggressive schoolyard fighter, neither of which she felt she would have gotten
to know if it hadn&#39;t been for Serena making friends with them first.
     &quot;Figures,&quot; Willow sighed as she sat back up and turned her attention to
what was being taught.  The material was unusually dry, and it wasn&#39;t even ten
minutes before the entire class was absently wondering if this was going to be
one of those weeks yet again.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Well?&quot; Rune prompted quietly as Si&#39;ren continued to stare at the display
after it was shut off, leaving the room in near-perfect silence.  They had been
preparing to head up to the turret where Rune&#39;s amplification crystals has been
growing all night when an aide came in with a recording of the broadcast from
the Hinterland drone.
     &quot;I don&#39;t envy them,&quot; Si&#39;ren said quietly.  &quot;I can only imagine what sort
of problems would arise if one of our moons suddenly decided to break up.&quot;
     Field Sergeant Alani glanced around the room before discreetly clearing
her throat, acutely aware of just how junior in rank she was among the rest of
the occupants.  &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; she ventured cautiously.  &quot;What about what he said
about a planetary evacuation?&quot;
     &quot;Good luck,&quot; Lieutenant Tempest spoke up.  &quot;You&#39;d need a fleet of heavy
cruisers just to clear out a small city, and even then we&#39;re talking a few
hundred thousand at most.  Now being in Security means I&#39;m not able to see the
big picture like Logistics or Intel might, but after three thousand years of
constant warfare I doubt there&#39;d be that many left.  Especially if they&#39;re on
the losing side,&quot; she added.
     &quot;And if they ask for an evacuation anyway?&quot; Captain Ael&#39;ien suggested in
a guarded tone.
     &quot;There is a human expression,&quot; Rune said casually.  &quot;Life&#39;s a bitch, and
then you die.&quot;
     Al&#39;vexi cleared her throat gently.  &quot;Perhaps we should not be getting
ahead of ourselves,&quot; she said in a neutral tone.  &quot;No such request has been
made as of yet.  Should one arrive, it will be filtered through the appropriate
channels at which point it will be taken under advisement.  Right now, however,
we have a more immediate problem on our hands.&quot;
     &quot;The radiation,&quot; Ael&#39;ien grunted quietly.
     Al&#39;vexi nodded slowly.  &quot;Correct.  I believe we should be ready to see if
this plan of ours will work.  Pa&#39;an Vol asked if he could have a little time to
himself out on the balcony to meditate before we begin, a request that was of
course granted.  I believe that he should be ready by now as well, so unless
there is something else of importance to discuss....&quot;
     &quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am?&quot; Tempest interrupted carefully.  &quot;I think that before
we begin this, we should all have a fair idea of how this is going to be done.
I don&#39;t mean from a power-networking standpoint, but rather from a procedural
one, like where you want me to start bringing the rain down and how you want
the storm to circulate.&quot;
     &quot;A fair question,&quot; Al&#39;vexi allowed as she glanced at Si&#39;ren.
     &quot;Like a radar sweep,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied.  &quot;I want a single line of storms on
a north bearing that will slowly sweep around in a circle using the Imperial
Castle as a pivot point.  The water will be drawn inwards towards the Castle
and pooled in the crater.  This will allow Vol to focus the majority of his
powers close-by instead of having to extend them outwards.  He will still have
to do that at some point to deal with what doesn&#39;t get swept up by the rain or
wind, but I&#39;d rather get the worst of it dealt with first so he doesn&#39;t have to
strain so hard when he goes to do that.&quot;
     &quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; Tempest replied with a curt nod of understanding.
&quot;The front will have to creep slowly if you want to have the squall line act as
a single entity, but it can be arranged.&quot;
     Rune turned to regard Si&#39;ren carefully.  &quot;Sure you can process that much
water at once?&quot; she inquired.
     &quot;Unassisted, of course not,&quot; the white-haired admiral replied calmly.
&quot;With Sergeant Alani&#39;s help and the amplification effects of your crystals, I
think it can work.  And if not, then we will try other plans until one does.&quot;
     &quot;Hopefully that won&#39;t be necessary, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ael&#39;ien&#39;s aide spoke up as she
cast a look of confidence towards Rune.  &quot;General Rune was kind enough to let
me briefly test the crystal structure she has constructed, and even without any
telepathic contact being established I was able to sense a rather strong echo
of her mind as she stood next to me.  If we can hold the overmind mesh in a
synergetic state, there shouldn&#39;t be any problems to speak of.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked in slight confusion.  &quot;Excuse me, Ensign, but that aspect
just went over my head.  What is an overmind mesh?&quot;
     &quot;Allow me to explain,&quot; Al&#39;vexi spoke up in a guarded tone, as if she were
choosing her words carefully.  &quot;The premise of this entire effort is for the
eight of us to act as a single entity in terms of both Chaos Factor powers and
that which directs it.  This will require us to merge our minds together as a
cohesive whole, a superconscious if you will.  This formation is known as an
overmind, and an overmind mesh when it is extended to include non-telepaths in
the matrix.  When there are enough people merged together as such, as will be
the case with eight of us, the overmind will evolve into a gestalt entity that
will not be under anyone&#39;s direct control but will rather tend to respond in
accordance to the will of the majority of its components.  As long as we are
all in general agreement, working together in synergy, the overmind will not
cause any conflicts or otherwise attempt anything unexpected.&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t think I like the sound of this,&quot; Rune said flatly.
     &quot;All that needs to be done is for everyone to focus on their individual
roles,&quot; Al&#39;vexi replied calmly.  &quot;Ael&#39;ien, A&#39;del, and I will work to keep the
matrix stable and ensure everyone is properly joined.  Alani will concentrate
on her amplification powers, Vol his accelerated radiation-decay ability, you
on keeping the crystal lattice structure balanced, Tempest on the weather, and
Si&#39;ren on controlling the contaminated water.  The only decision-making that is
necessary will be on the pace, and that will be set by mutual consensus between
Tempest, Si&#39;ren, and Vol.  This will not be an in-depth mind link but merely a
sort of forum environment, so there are no mental privacy concerns that you
need to be worried about, either.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s a relief,&quot; Tempest said dryly.
     Ael&#39;ien raised an eyebrow in amusement.  &quot;Treasonous thoughts we need to
know about, Lieutenant?&quot; she said lightly, her expression clearly indicating
that it was a joke.
     The security officer chuckled quietly to herself.  &quot;Of course not, ma&#39;am,&quot;
she replied with a grin.  &quot;Just the usual classified things that Security has
to deal with every single day.  I&#39;d tell you about it, but you&#39;re not cleared
for it so then I&#39;d have to kill you.  Nothing personal, Captain.&quot;
     Al&#39;vexi cast a quick glance at Si&#39;ren, noticing that the admiral was also
casting a brief glance back at her.  The exchange between Tempest and Ael&#39;ien
had been entirely in jest, but it was an unwelcome reminder of the current
suspicions about the Dragoon Legion as well as Ael&#39;ien&#39;s psionic link to the
current Dragoon Commander.  Then of course there was the distinct possibility
that the former Dragoon Commander was with them as well, which only made the
overall situation even more uncertain.
     &quot;If the two of you are finished?&quot; Rune said in a faintly clipped tone.
     &quot;A&#39;del, go ahead and take Tempest and Alani up to the terrace,&quot; Al&#39;vexi
instructed calmly.  &quot;The rest of us will be along shortly.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the Psi-Corp ensign said crisply as she started to head for
the door.  She waited until Tempest and Alani were with her before triggering
the sensor that opened the door, allowing them to exit the conference room in
measured silence.
     Ael&#39;ien waited in uneasy silence, getting the distinct impression that
there was something the flag officers wanted to talk to her about that wasn&#39;t
meant to be for the ears of anyone else.  That indicated that the topic had
nothing to do with their current problem of dealing with the intense radiation
surrounding the Imperial Castle, which only made her sense of unease worse.
Both Rune and Si&#39;ren seemed to be a little surprised by the request but didn&#39;t
indicate any objections or unusual impatience, which to Ael&#39;ien meant that it
was all Al&#39;vexi&#39;s idea.
     The retired telepath cast a brief glance at Si&#39;ren before drawing in a
deep but subtle breath.  &quot;Ael, how is your psionic link with Commander K&#39;tal
holding up?&quot; she inquired in a somewhat neutral tone.
     &quot;I haven&#39;t been able to feel anything since he transited the aerial route
in the Northern Mountains,&quot; Ael&#39;ien said slowly.  &quot;Whether that is due to the
mountains themselves or the distance between us is unknown, but I suspect it&#39;s
the distance.&quot;
     &quot;But you feel that the link is intact, though, correct?&quot; Al&#39;vexi prodded.
     Ael&#39;ien paused for a moment before she briefly turned her focus inward,
very gently probing the mental link.  She felt absolutely nothing coming from
the link itself, but she could still discern the fact that there was something
anchored in her mind.  &quot;I think so,&quot; she replied.
     Al&#39;vexi let her breath out in a soft sigh before glancing over at Si&#39;ren
again.  &quot;If I am correct,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;It is likely that, between the
amplification effects of Rune&#39;s crystals and Alani&#39;s enhancement ability, you
will be able to contact him once again through the bond.  If that is the case,
it is important that we know what he personally and the Dragoon Legion as a
whole intends to do.&quot;
     &quot;In what regard?&quot; Ael&#39;ien managed to say without reacting on the outside.
Inside, however, she was struggling to throw off the deep chill that was trying
to crawl down her spine.  She could read between the lines as well as anyone
else and knew that she was being asked to spy on K&#39;tal&#39;s thoughts.  Such a
thing was quite unethical, but it was not unknown for telepaths to be employed
in such a manner for reconnaissance.... or to confirm suspicions of treason.
     &quot;The Moon Princess,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up quietly.
     &quot;I... will look into it, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ael&#39;ien promised quietly.
     &quot;One more thing, Captain,&quot; Al&#39;vexi added.  &quot;If Tolaris is indeed with the
Dragoon Legion as we suspect he is, we need to have that confirmed as well.&quot;
     &quot;Understood,&quot; the Psi-Corp captain said simply, still struggling to keep
an outward appearance of neutrality.
     Rune snorted quietly as she headed for the door.  &quot;If Nop&#39;tera would have
listened to me, we wouldn&#39;t have to be worried about the Moon Princess anymore,
now would we?&quot; she grumbled darkly.
     &quot;General Rune, don&#39;t start,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a weary tone, drawing a dark
glare from the other woman.  &quot;Worry about keeping the crystals together for the
moment and save the recriminations for another point in time.  I doubt that we
will have to deal with the Moon Princess anytime soon given her present state
of health.  Al?&quot; she added over her shoulder as she noticed the distracted look
on Al&#39;vexi&#39;s face.
     &lt;We might have a problem,&gt; Al&#39;vexi telepathed with a sigh.  &lt;Ensign A&#39;del
just informed me that a pair of Healers are waiting for us out on the terrace
with Pa&#39;an Vol.  They said that they will be monitoring our health while we are
doing this, which I both understand and gladly accept, but that one of them is
Master Healer Maq&#39;i.&gt;
     That caused both Si&#39;ren and Rune to halt in their tracks.  &quot;They let her
return to duty?&quot; Rune said incredulously.
     &quot;Why not?&quot; Si&#39;ren countered.  &quot;She is still a Master Healer, and as long
as Security has no reason to believe she did anything wrong, why should we?  So
she went with the Sailor Scouts to ensure that her patient was properly tended
to while she healed.  Tell me what Healer wouldn&#39;t do that?&quot;
     &lt;It gets better,&gt; Al&#39;vexi warned.  &lt;It seems that Maq&#39;i realized that Vol
was of the K&#39;maal &#39;il Hal&#39;al and told him about both the Moon Princess and what
the Chaos Factor has done to her.  A&#39;del reports that the Pa&#39;an is more than a
little unsettled, but not nearly as unsettled as everyone else is right now at
hearing Maq&#39;i&#39;s words.  It seems Tempest promptly gave everyone a headache with
a very loud thunderclap, no doubt a simple slippage of her powers from shock,
and I can clearly feel A&#39;del&#39;s unease from here.  I suspect that the situation
just got worse, Si&#39;ren.  A lot worse.&gt;
     &quot;Out with it, Al,&quot; Rune demanded in a flat tone.  &quot;What is going on?&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;re trying to stop a civil war before it starts, Rune,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in
a muted tone, causing both Rune and Ael&#39;ien to blink hard.  &quot;I know you were
there when it was revealed that Princess Serena is the daughter of the Dragoon
Captain, and that you promptly tried to keep that information as quiet as you
could.  I myself didn&#39;t learn this little fact until yesterday, and I can very
easily see why you kept it quiet.  However, that particular secret is starting
to become public knowledge now, and once it does we are almost guaranteed to
have a rebellion of some sort by somebody.&quot;
     &quot;You think it has already started, don&#39;t you?&quot; Ael&#39;ien suddenly said as it
hit her like a lead weight.  &quot;You think the Dragoons are going to revolt?&quot;
     &quot;If they haven&#39;t already,&quot; Al&#39;vexi suggested calmly.  &quot;This is why I&#39;ve
asked you to use your psionic link to K&#39;tal to assess his state of mind and
ascertain his intentions.  We could ask him directly, of course, and we have
every intention of doing so once the channels are completely clear, but we need
to be absolutely and positively certain we understand what he and the rest of
the Dragoon Legion intends to do.&quot;
     &quot;I.... understand,&quot; Ael&#39;ien said slowly as the dark chill inside her only
got worse.
     &lt;Ael, put aside your feelings for him,&gt; Al&#39;vexi telepathed quietly as she
headed for the door.  &lt;This has little to do with him personally, but rather
what direction he will send the Dragoons in.  We are looking at the very real
chance that this could destroy our world.&gt;
     &lt;Think I don&#39;t know that?&gt; the Psi-Corp captain telepathed back, causing
the retired general to stop in her tracks at the sharpness of the mental tone.
&lt;What&#39;s more, do you honestly believe he doesn&#39;t know that as well?  You most
likely know him just as much as I do, or at least in regards to how he thinks.
Do you honestly have that little faith in him to genuinely think that he isn&#39;t
going to do what he sees as being best for this world?&gt;
     &lt;That, child, it precisely what has us worried,&gt; Al&#39;vexi replied in an icy
tone.  &lt;What he sees as being best and what people such as General Rune and I
see as being the best are most likely not the same thing.  All I have asked of
you is to find out his viewpoint, nothing more.&gt;
     &quot;Al?&quot; Rune prompted warily, giving both telepaths suspicious looks.  While
her own meager psionic skill wasn&#39;t powerful enough to let her transmit her
thoughts to another mind or listen in on a private mental broadcast, she could
still &#39;hear&#39; a very soft synaptic buzzing sound whenever someone was using
telepathy around her.
     &quot;Just making sure everyone is ready,&quot; Al&#39;vexi said calmly as she reached
the door and stepped into the hallway.  &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot;
     Rune frowned and cast a dark look at Ael&#39;ien before she followed Al&#39;vexi
out of the room, leaving Si&#39;ren and Ael&#39;ien alone together.  They looked at one
another in uneasy silence before the Fleet Admiral sighed quietly.
     &quot;Let me make one thing clear, Captain,&quot; Si&#39;ren said very softly.  &quot;I don&#39;t
know what Rune intends to do, but I am certain it is not even close to what
either K&#39;tal or Tolaris would do.  I&#39;m not sure I can trust either of them at
this point, and I&#39;m starting to get the feeling that I can&#39;t trust Rune either.
If there is any way at all we can defuse this situation, I need to know about
it so I can see if I can do something with it and I need to know now.  Holding
anything back will not benefit anyone at this point.&quot;
     Ael&#39;ien nodded slowly.  &quot;I understand, ma&#39;am,&quot; she replied quietly.
     &quot;Good,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she headed towards the hallway.  &quot;At least one
of us understands her role in this.  That&#39;s actually a bit of an improvement,
if I may say so myself....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Not so hard, please,&quot; Whisper said calmly from her meditative position
hovering four feet above the floor, supported only by her telekinetic powers.
A shielded plasma sword was floating several feet away from her, the glowing
gray weapon likewise under the direction of her mental abilities.
     &quot;Sorry, habit,&quot; Sailor Uranus replied as she paused to catch her breath.
The plasma sword in her hands had turned a bright yellow color moments after
being ignited, resulting in a brief discussion before the practice fight had
begun in relative earnest.  The fact that there was almost no risk to Whisper
whatsoever had allowed Uranus the chance to unwind, thrusting and slashing her
weapon with almost reckless abandon and with a fury that was not easy to tell
if it was controlled or not.
     That was not to say that it wasn&#39;t taking a toll on the telepath.  The
force of Uranus&#39; weapon against her own was still keenly felt as she had to
keep exerting her telekinetic powers to keep her own blade stable.  She wasn&#39;t
nearly as winded as the blonde Sailor Scout was at the moment, doing little
else aside from providing a target for Uranus, but keeping both herself and the
blade supported by her powers was starting to become slightly more difficult
with each passing minute.
     &quot;Do you always try to beat your partner senseless in training?&quot; Whisper
inquired mildly as Uranus suddenly exploded into a series of vicious slashes
and powerful spinning blows that she would have been unable to block had she
actually been holding the weapon with her hands.
     &quot;Like Sue keeps saying,&quot; Uranus grunted as she spun around for another
hard slash that produced a ringing hum of colliding forcefields, &quot;Pain is a
very effective teacher.  A few cracked knuckles usually wises you up to your
opponent&#39;s tactics in a hurry.  Damn, this thing is light,&quot; she fussed as she
hit the floating plasma sword hard enough to flip it end-over-end before it
could be brought back under control.
     &quot;Careful,&quot; Whisper warned, keeping a very wary eye on where the shielded
plasma was going, aware of how even a shielded plasma field could seriously
hurt if it made contact with unprotected skin for longer than a fraction of a
second.  It was hardly unknown, and more often than not expected, for novices
to the delicate art of plasma sword fighting to acquire at least one fairly
serious burn mark in a largely random location from just such a strike.
     Uranus stepped back and eyed the pommel in her hands for several seconds
before sighing through her nose.  &quot;Ah, screw it,&quot; she muttered as she thumbed
the weapon off.  The plasma field promptly collapsed with a soft whooshing
sound, allowing the force field that contained it to shrink in size until it
vanished as well.  &quot;I think that&#39;s enough for one morning.  Starting to put a
serious strain on my wrists, too.  I&#39;m not used to tossing something around
that weighs less than a good length of steel.&quot;
     Whisper said nothing as she closed her eyes, focusing on her surroundings
using only her psionic senses.  A simple telekinetic brush of her mind found
the toggle for her weapon, gently flicking it into the off-position to close
down the plasma field.  The now-inert pommel drifted back over to her, lightly
settling into her lap as she continued to hover in a half-meditative state.
     Uranus regarded her carefully as she started to stretch and massage her
sword arm.  &quot;You do this floating thing often?&quot; she inquired.
     &lt;We all have various skills that need practice every so often,&gt; Whisper
replied quietly.  &lt;You have your sword, I have my mind.  Both can be deadly if
wielded properly, but otherwise are simply dead weight if left to rust.&gt;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; the blonde observed, scowling as her shoulder started to kink.
&quot;So tell me again what exactly you can do with your mind?&quot;
     &lt;A lot,&gt; the denizen said with a clearly discernible mental shrug.  &lt;My
strongest powers are telepathy and psychokinesis, with a few psychoportation
abilities as well.  I&#39;m not nearly as proficient with clairsentience powers as
Ra&#39;vel is, but she lacks my psychokinetic powers, so it&#39;s a fair trade in my
view.  The reflection test I did with Michelle&#39;s mirror drew on my telekinetic
powers,&gt; she added.
     &quot;Yeah, like I understood half that,&quot; Uranus grumbled as she continued to
rotate and massage her shoulder.
     &lt;Telepathy is far more than speaking into your mind,&gt; Whisper explained.
&lt;Were you to consent to it, I could merge our minds together so I could view
your memories, allow you to view mine, or even fuse our minds into a single
unified entity that draws on the both of us.  I could also exert an influence
on how your mind works, altering thoughts, behaviors, even memories.&gt;
     &quot;So I&#39;ve heard,&quot; Uranus said quietly in a glacial tone as she looked away
from the hovering telepath.  &quot;Did you really have to do a number on Darian?&quot;
     Whisper sighed quietly and opened her eyes to look at the blonde, feeling
a more than a little depressed herself at both the reminder of her role in
Darian&#39;s brainwashing as well as where the conversation was going.  &quot;If Serena
asked you to kill Jedyt, would you refuse?&quot; she asked in a neutral tone.  &quot;Of
course you wouldn&#39;t, you&#39;d jump at the chance to bring harm to the enemy of
your princess.  So why would it be any different than my Queen asking me to do
something to someone who was, at the time, one of our worst enemies?&quot;
     &quot;I s&#39;pose so,&quot; Uranus said in an uncertain tone.
     &quot;In any case, Sailor Uranus, I long ago apologized to Darian and have
since worked to make amends,&quot; Whisper continued.  &quot;We are fairly good friends
these days, despite what happened last year, and I daresay we are even more so
now since the discovery of his anointment as Crown Prince.  That.... reminds
me,&quot; she suddenly said in a hesitant tone.  &quot;I really should sit down with him
again for another scan of his memories.  The mind-block came apart cleanly and
left no discernible residue, if you will, but I still think a detailed scan
would be best to make absolutely sure there are no.... lingering concerns.&quot;
     Uranus shrugged and started to pace the training room.  &quot;Don&#39;t want to
hear about it,&quot; she said in a clipped tone as she resumed rubbing her shoulder.
She suddenly froze in mid-motion as she felt a force start to massage the area,
looking up to give Whisper a suspicious look.
     &lt;You have a muscle kink, it seems,&gt; the telepath thought as she closed her
eyes and focused on her psychokinetic probe of Uranus&#39; shoulder.  &lt;A hot shower
might help.&gt;
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Uranus replied dryly, casting a look at the blast doors as they
started to slowly hiss open.  &quot;I was going to wait until I was sure Mich was
out of the shower, but apparently that&#39;s not an issue anymore....&quot;
     &quot;Fair morning,&quot; Whisper said aloud as she cracked one eye open.
     &quot;Morning,&quot; Michelle replied quietly as she padded barefoot into the room,
still wearing the borrowed nightshirt and apparently very little else.  Myst
was curled up in a contented ball in her arms, seeming to be in a far better
mood than she was in after yesterday&#39;s events.
     Uranus paused and raised an eyebrow as her lover approached.  &quot;You&#39;re up
a little late this morning,&quot; she observed.  She blinked as Michelle promptly
leaned in for a soft but fairly deep kiss that lasted far longer than usual.
The kiss was eventually broken, at which point Michelle simply gave Uranus a
soft smile and wordlessly headed back towards the exit.  The blast doors hissed
shut after she left, leaving Uranus standing in the middle of the training room
with a deeply resigned look on her face.
     &quot;Is everything alright?&quot; Whisper inquired in a careful tone.
     &quot;She&#39;s still a touch upset with me,&quot; Uranus sighed.  &quot;Otherwise she&#39;s in
an unusually good mood.  Not that she isn&#39;t a morning person, which she is, but
she still likes to sleep in as much as the rest of us do.  Maybe Myst slept on
her tits last night and kept them nice and warm or something.  Who knows.&quot;
     Whisper gave the other woman a slightly pained look before shaking her
head and gently lowering herself back down to the ground.  &quot;I&#39;ll let you handle
that one, if you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she said as she made an absent gesture with her
hand.  The plasma sword pommel promptly jerked out from Uranus&#39; grasp and flew
across the room to land in her own hand, producing a somewhat violent startled
reaction from the blonde.
     &quot;Hey!  Goddamn, *warn* me before you do that!&quot; she groused as she tried
to calm down, holding one hand to her petite chest.  &quot;I about pissed myself.&quot;
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; Whisper replied as she carried both weapons into the open vault
and set them back into their charging units.  She paused as she only counted
three sword pommels in addition to the plasma lance hilt, trying to remember
what happened to the fourth weapon.  &lt;Question,&gt; she broadcast back out to the
rest of the training room.  &lt;Does Mina still have that plasma sword she asked
to borrow the other day?&gt;
     &quot;Damned if I know,&quot; Uranus called back loudly.
     &lt;If you see her before I do, please ask about it.  I don&#39;t mind too much
if she continues to hold onto it, but they don&#39;t hold a full charge for longer
than a few days and probably needs to be recharged by now.&gt;
     &quot;I&#39;ll try to keep that in mind,&quot; Uranus said in a normal voice as she
stepped into the vault, casually eying the collection of weapons that lined
three walls and took up several display cases in the middle of the room.  &quot;Not
that I wouldn&#39;t mind keeping one of those in my back pocket for emergencies or
when I have to cut through something solid like what Blondie did to those blast
doors back in the tunnel, but don&#39;t ask me to use it if I still have my saber
around.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s always good to have a backup weapon,&quot; a voice said behind her in an
amused tone, causing Uranus to whirl around and draw her saber in a single,
fluid movement.
     &quot;Goddamn,&quot; Uranus panted as she recognized their unexpected visitor.  &quot;Is
the rest of today going to be like this?  Don&#39;t sneak up on me like that!&quot; she
growled quietly.
     &quot;Fair morning,&quot; Whisper called out in a slightly wary tone.
     Megan paused for a moment before nodding slowly.  &quot;Yes, I suppose we can
call it a fair morning,&quot; she said, absently smoothing a few wrinkles out of her
rather conservative, if form-fitting, business attire.  &quot;I just wanted to let
you know that Susan is not likely to return until this evening, as she said she
had a fair amount of what she called &#39;administrative paperwork&#39; to handle.  Not
that I have the slightest idea what she meant,&quot; the succubus admitted as she
fluffed her hair behind her.  &quot;Oh, and Lisa has returned to the Underworld to
Queen Persephone&#39;s side, so you won&#39;t have to worry about her bothering you for
a day or so either.  Nice suit,&quot; she added as she gave Uranus an open look of
appraisal.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Uranus replied distantly.  &quot;Do I want to ask why you&#39;re dressed
in a suit like that?  And where&#39;s the bat?&quot; she added as she realized that the
pair of head-wings were missing.
     A dangerously coy smile crossed Megan&#39;s face as she ran her hands along
the length of her dark skirt.  &quot;Balregu is at home sleeping on his perch, as he
doesn&#39;t exactly qualify as business-casual.  As for the suit itself.... let&#39;s
just say I&#39;m scheduled to have a power-lunch with the vice-president of a mid-
sized corporation.  Apparently he is not in the best of health and recently
picked up a very nasty drug addiction that will, sad to say, be the end of him
in a few hours.  It&#39;s shameful what some people do while on company time.  Or
whom,&quot; she added lightly.  &quot;Corporate interns aren&#39;t what they used to be.&quot;
     &quot;Uh....&quot; Uranus said very slowly, not entirely sure what to make of the
succubus&#39; words.
     &quot;Don&#39;t worry, he won&#39;t suffer,&quot; Megan purred as she absently licked her
lips.  &quot;In fact, he&#39;ll be having the time of his life and probably won&#39;t even
notice.  That&#39;s happened to me before, you know,&quot; she added casually, ignoring
the way both Whisper&#39;s and Uranus&#39; eyes widened in shock at the realization of
what she was talking about.  &quot;You go to harvest a soul, have a little fun with
him beforehand, and the smile is still on his face even at the very end.  Oh,
don&#39;t look at me like that, I&#39;ve been given personal instructions by Lord Hades
himself.  Believe it or not, this happens.... I won&#39;t say all the time, but it
does occur with regular frequency.  Just ask Susan how many souls she has been
tasked to recall.&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t think we need to be hearing about this,&quot; Whisper pointed out in
a fairly flat tone.
     Megan shrugged her shoulders, impressively flexing her chest beneath the
somewhat stiff lines of her business attire.  &quot;As you wish.  I just thought I&#39;d
let you know what to expect, as you may encounter it in tomorrow&#39;s newspaper
headlines.  Probably below the fold, however,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;It is, after
all, not too prominent of a company and the veep is almost sixty years old.&quot;
     &quot;Yeech,&quot; Uranus muttered quietly to herself, trying very hard to clear her
mind of the visual of the seemingly-youthful succubus being screwed by a sixty-
year-old man on some business desk.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Megan said demurely.  &quot;I&#39;ve done what my sister asked me to do,
namely tell you not to expect her until dinner, so now I must be off.  Give my
regards to your princess.  She is.... a rather curiously unique individual,&quot;
she admitted with a soft note of admiration.
     &quot;We&#39;ll be sure to pass that along for you,&quot; Uranus replied dryly as she
traded wary looks with Whisper.
     Megan shrugged absently in dismissal as she turned away.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say
that the more I hear being said about her, the more intrigued I am.  No matter,
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll run into her again soon enough.  As will you and I, of course,&quot;
she added before she started to leave the vault.  She had almost reached the
exit before pausing to study a pair of whip-like weapons hanging from hooks on
one of the wall displays.  &quot;Oooh, what have we here?&quot; she purred softly.
     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re into those,&quot; Uranus said in an uneasy tone as she
returned her Soul Saber to its dimensional sheath.
     Megan paused and cast a sidelong look at the blonde.  &quot;I happen to favor
using a whip when I am in need of a weapon,&quot; she explained calmly.  &quot;It has a
certain.... elegance to it when wielded properly.  But then again, I&#39;m sure you
have your reasons for your choice of weapon.  A steel blade for you, a whip for
me, a staff for Susan, nunchaku for Lisa.... do I want to ask what you use?&quot;
she inquired as she turned to look at Whisper.
     &lt;Psionics,&gt; Whisper telepathed to her, causing Megan&#39;s red eyes to widen.
What followed next was a brief burst of eldritch noise from the succubus that
might have been construed as being part of a language if either Whisper or
Sailor Uranus had been able to properly hear the exotic sounds.
     &quot;Yeah, what she said,&quot; Uranus spoke up after a moment of mild confusion,
giving Whisper a plaintive look and getting a helpless shrug in reply.
     &quot;I know what psionics are,&quot; Megan said quietly.  &quot;And if you have what it
takes to use them.... well, let&#39;s just say that you&#39;re a lot more dangerous
than I had initially thought.  Things are definitely getting interesting now,&quot;
she murmured to herself as she turned away and silently left the vault.
     Uranus watched her depart before turning around to look at Whisper.  &quot;Can
I go back to bed now?&quot; she asked in a weary tone.
     &quot;I think I know what you mean,&quot; the telepath grumbled quietly as she began
to lightly massage her sinuses.  &quot;And no, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea if you
tried laying back down on the couch.  There&#39;s a fair amount of cleaning to do
this morning, after all, which should end up making some noise.  Besides, you
really need to take a shower first,&quot; she pointed out.
     Uranus just rolled her eyes.  &quot;Yes, mother,&quot; she sighed as she started to
head towards the archway.  &quot;I&#39;ll tell you one thing, though, Maggie&#39;s probably
right about the interesting part.&quot;
     &quot;I think you mean Megan,&quot; Whisper corrected gently as she followed the
blonde Sailor Scout out of the vault.
     &quot;Whatever.  If Sue&#39;s going to be busy all day dealing with paperwork, she
might actually come back in a tolerable mood,&quot; Uranus mused.  &quot;I mean, I don&#39;t
care what anyone says, I&#39;ve watched her with my own eyes enough times to know
she absolutely loves sorting out little nit-picky bureaucratic details.  If it
happens to be complicated stuff, she could actually end up in a playful mood
that has nothing to do with sex for once.  Hell, for all I know, she could be
getting her rocks off even now over paperwork being filed in triplicate....&quot;
     This is going to be a long day, Whisper thought to herself with a sigh.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Ouch,&quot; Leda purred very quietly to Mina as they both watched the new
student make her way over to an unassigned desk after being introduced to the
class by the teacher.
     &quot;Down, girl, easy,&quot; Mina replied languidly, glancing over at the brunette
in time to catch the half-amused look directed at her.  &quot;She&#39;s pretty, alright,
but I doubt she&#39;s really your type.  She looks fragile to me, and I don&#39;t think
you&#39;d be able to play with glass for very long without breaking something.&quot;
     &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Leda grumbled quietly.
     &quot;Cheer up, we can talk to her after class,&quot; Mina pointed out with a very
cheerful smile.  &quot;If nothing else, I want to know her beauty secrets.  I never
really cared for pale hair or anything, but it has a really nice shine to it.
Wonder what kind of shampoo she uses?&quot;
     Leda just shook her head absently.  &quot;If you can get to her before all the
boys do,&quot; she pointed out, not missing the way that every single male in the
classroom was watching Lilibeth.  &quot;Just look at &#39;em, I can almost feel their
hormones lighting up from here.&quot;
     &quot;Sure that&#39;s not just your own going off?&quot; Mina inquired with a smirk.
     &quot;I&#39;m just saying she&#39;s cute, girl, back off,&quot; Leda countered.  &quot;Anyway,
like I said, good luck getting to talk to her before she gets mobbed by the
goon squad.&quot;
     &quot;O, ye of little faith,&quot; the blonde chuckled quietly.  &quot;Keep in mind you
are in the august presence of a master of misdirection.  Trust me, girl, I&#39;ll
be able to talk to her after class.&quot;
     Leda paused and cast a sidelong glance at her.  &quot;Great, now I&#39;m worried
what you plan to do,&quot; she grumbled.
     &quot;Trust me,&quot; Mina whispered with a truly disarming smile.
     The brunette just shook her head to herself and eyed the wall clock, not
looking forward to the next fifty minutes of history class and wondering just
how long it would feel like before the day was over.  Or at least until it was
time for lunch and she could check up on how Serena was doing.  She had only
caught a brief snippet of the conversation between Mina and Melvin in the hall
earlier, but it seemed that Serena was a little jumpy this morning.  That, and
the long-haired blonde had already gotten a head-start on getting to know their
new student from Nova Scotia.
     Hell, if I had gone through what she did over our extended weekend, I&#39;d
probably be jumpy too, she thought to herself.  But she must not be doing too
bad if she can still make friends like that.  I still don&#39;t see how she does
it, especially with a foreign exchange student.  That reminds me, I need to ask
Ami just where hell Nova Scotia is on a map....

                *               *               *               *

     &lt;General Rune?&gt; Al&#39;vexi said in a concerned tone.  She was sitting down on
a chair-like protrusion from the now-massive crystal structure that was taking
up fully half of the terrace&#39;s floorspace.  The seat was contoured slightly and
angled back to let her recline a few degrees, but she had the feeling that the
unyielding surface was going to make everyone&#39;s backside more than a little
stiff and sore before this was over.
     &quot;Not so loud, Al,&quot; Rune sighed as she massaged her temples slowly.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Ensign A&#39;del asked cautiously, keeping one
eye on Al&#39;vexi as she interacted with the amplification crystals and the other
on the pained look on Rune&#39;s face.
     Rune looked at her carefully for a moment before sighing again, not overly
thrilled at having to admit to a weakness.  &quot;I&#39;m just a little sensitive to
telepathic emanations,&quot; she admitted quietly.  &quot;I can&#39;t hear anything that is
thought-broadcasted, but I do feel a sort of buzz in my mind from it.  And now
that Al&#39;vexi is using the crystal matrix to augment her mental powers, the hum
in the background just got a lot louder.&quot;
     &lt;Synaptic static, most likely,&gt; Al&#39;vexi thought.  &lt;Sit down and open your
mind to me.  If this works as I suspect it should, I will be able to shield you
from the side-effects.  It will also give me a chance to test the Chaos Factor
integration aspect before I draw either A&#39;del or Ael&#39;ien into this.&gt;
     &quot;One second, General,&quot; Master Healer Maq&#39;i said as she stepped forward and
placed her hand on the back of Rune&#39;s neck.  A soft white glow encompassed her
hand a moment later as she directed a small amount of her healing energy into
Rune&#39;s head and neck, trying to discern if there was a obvious cause for the
headache.  She felt absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, save for a high
level of tension, but that was completely expected.  &quot;Forgive me, but I wanted
to rule out any sudden physical ailments,&quot; she explained as she gently removed
her hand and stepped back.
     &quot;I assure you it&#39;s entirely mental,&quot; Rune said, giving Maq&#39;i a slightly
unfriendly look before she moved to sit down next to Al&#39;vexi.  She shifted her
weight around until she was as comfortable as she thought she was going to get
before leaning her head back and resting it in the shallow impression.  She let
her hands fall to her sides and slipped them into the deep grooves on either
side of her, letting her fingertips come into contact with the hypersensitive
nodes of the crystal structure that she had grown for the purpose of directing
and controlling their energies.
     She closed her eyes as she felt a ghost-like touch on her mind, followed
by a spectral chill as she was enveloped by Al&#39;vexi&#39;s mental presence.  The
thundering noise in her mind&#39;s ear promptly peaked before fading away into a
very blissful silence, resulting in a soft sigh of relief.  Her senses likewise
faded away several moments later, leaving her feeling alone and in a floating
trance of sorts.
     &lt;Good, I think we&#39;re ready to proceed,&gt; Al&#39;vexi&#39;s voice said calmly.
     &lt;Are you sure this is going to work?&gt; Rune thought, a feeling of shock
washing through her as she both felt and heard her words being broadcast into
the psionic realm.  &lt;Wait, what just happened?  Why am I...?&gt;
     &lt;Chaos merge, Rune,&gt; Al&#39;vexi explained patiently.  &lt;We now have access to
one another&#39;s powers of Chaos, or at least we do on a primitive level.  I can
feel the power flowing through this crystal structure now, and I must say I am
more than a little awed by the.... geometric beauty of it.  It&#39;s quite hard to
put into words,&gt; she admitted.  &lt;But at least we proved it works, at least for
us.  When this is over, you need to document what you did in as much precise
detail as you can possibly manage.  This is a very major breakthrough, Rune,
one that can have unimaginable possibilities if we explore it properly.&gt;
     &lt;Right....&gt; Rune said slowly.
     &lt;No desire for scientific glory, hmm?&gt; Al&#39;vexi sighed.  &lt;No matter, I&#39;m
sure something can be worked out.  Later.  Captain Ael&#39;ien, would you be so
kind as to have a seat and join us?&gt; she broadcast in a significantly louder
telepathic voice.
     &lt;Two seats to my left,&gt; Rune instructed, likewise boosting the mental
output of her psionic voice.  There was a sudden period of silence before she
felt a third presence suddenly join the group.  An icy tingle swept through her
very being as her senses became briefly disoriented, slowly returning to what
felt like normal.  At least, she thought it felt like normal....
     &lt;Oh, excuse me,&gt; Ael&#39;ien apologized quietly.  &lt;This is.... going to be one
of those messy melds, isn&#39;t it?&gt;
     &lt;Not if you, A&#39;del and I work together to form the basis of the overmind,&gt;
the retired general replied calmly.  &lt;Remember, this will be a mesh and a bit
of an unbalanced one at that.  The overmind must be free to act as necessary,
but not so free that it exerts itself independently.&gt;
     &lt;In that case, let me see if we can try a deeper meld here.&gt;
     &lt;Wait for A&#39;del, then.  Ensign A&#39;del, please have a seat two spaces off to
my right,&gt; Al&#39;vexi instructed calmly.
     Rune waited patiently as her senses started to blur around the edges once
again before becoming stable.  She was now aware of the psionic dampening field
around her, a sort of bubble encasing her brain that could be traced back along
a shimmering thread to where Al&#39;vexi&#39;s voice resided.  Curious, she started to
look around, surprised to find more shimmering threads forming around her.  She
very carefully picked one up and tried to see where it went.
     &lt;Hey, hey, hey, don&#39;t do that!&gt; A&#39;del&#39;s voice protested stridently.  &lt;With
all due respect to whomever it is, you really do NOT want to try using that
sort of power without knowing how to handle it and I myself still don&#39;t have a
very solid hold on it.  Umm.... how did you do that, anyway?  Oh, wait, I see
now.... interesting.&gt;
     &lt;Indeed this is, though I&#39;m a little hesitant to explore this just yet.&gt;
     &lt;We can do so once this crisis is over.  Do you think this meld is deep
enough to handle the overmind mesh?&gt;
     &lt;It should be, although any deeper and we&#39;re going to be needing intellect
barriers to protect our conscious identities.  I say we start adding the mind-
blinds and see how it goes.  Umm, no offense, ma&#39;am.&gt;
     &lt;If I knew what a mind-blind was, I could tell you if I was offended by
that or not....&gt;
     &lt;Someone who isn&#39;t psionically active.&gt;
     &lt;I suppose I should be offended by that, then....&gt;
     &lt;Admiral Si&#39;ren, would you please have a seat between General Rune and
Captain Ael&#39;ien?  Yes, just relax and open your mind, that&#39;s it....&gt;
     &lt;....&gt;
     &lt;Excuse me, but what is this?&gt;
     &lt;That?  Hmm.... ah, that would be Ael&#39;ien&#39;s mental link to K&#39;tal.&gt;
     &lt;The Dragoon Commander?  But isn&#39;t he way over in...?&gt;
     &lt;I will explain later.&gt;
     &lt;Wow, this is.... interesting....&gt;
     &lt;Welcome to the party, Admiral.&gt;
     &lt;Are.... we sure this is going to work?  This feels very.... odd.&gt;
     &lt;The situation is, for the moment, under control.  I assume that this is
how your water-control power works?&gt;
     &lt;Hey, how&#39;d you do that?&gt;
     &lt;Just take it easy, we&#39;re all still learning how this Chaos Factor overlap
is working.  Rune, how are the energy levels working out at the moment?&gt;
     [ ]
     &lt;What the hell was that?&gt;
     &lt;That wasn&#39;t me....&gt;
     &lt;That was the overmind starting to take shape.  General Rune?&gt;
     &lt;I.... think we&#39;re good.&gt;
     &lt;You don&#39;t sound very confident, ma&#39;am.&gt;
     &lt;I&#39;m not sure that this is even my power anymore.  I mean, I know I&#39;m the
one who has it encoded in my DNA, but.... the control is a little iffy.&gt;
     &lt;The overmind will handle that, just relax.  Lieutenant Tempest, please
have a seat next to Captain Ael&#39;ien.&gt;
     [   ]
     &lt;Is it supposed to do that?&gt;
     &lt;That&#39;s how a mind sounds when it&#39;s catatonic.  No, really.&gt;
     &lt;Someone asleep at the wheel?&gt;
     &lt;No, as I said it is merely the overmind starting to take shape.  Are you
alright, Lieutenant?&gt;
     &lt;Umm.... hang on, I think I just lost control of the weather....&gt;
     &lt;Uh-oh.&gt;
     &lt;Wait, wait, I think I&#39;ve got it.  This is.... very odd, I might add.&gt;
     &lt;Here, let me help you with that.&gt;
     &lt;Watchitwatchitwatchit....&gt;
     &lt;Oops, what&#39;d we just hit?&gt;
     &lt;Felt like a tree.&gt;
     &lt;A little lightning never hurt, right?&gt;
     &lt;Wait, stop, just let it.... there, let the ions flow naturally.  Yeah,
like that.  See, if you do this, you trigger another lightning bolt, but if you
let it do that, the energy stays contained in the clouds.&gt;
     &lt;Damn, how long did it take you to learn to control it all like that?&gt;
     &lt;Weeks, and please don&#39;t ask about the damage I ended up doing.  It is not
something I like to dwell upon.  Umm, wait, who&#39;s playing with the moisture
content in the atmosphere?&gt;
     &lt;That might be me, my water-control power seems to have gotten awfully
twitchy all of a sudden.&gt;
     [   ]
     &lt;Who&#39;s that?&gt;
     &lt;Hey, I think that&#39;s what keeps tugging on my powers.  Make it stop?&gt;
     &lt;Pa&#39;an Vol, please sit down between myself and Ensign A&#39;del.&gt;
     &lt;This might not be such a good idea after all....&gt;
     &lt;....&gt;
     [     ]
     &lt;Wow, that thing is really starting to wake up.&gt;
     &lt;Amazing....&gt;
     &lt;Not used to mind links, Pa&#39;an?&gt;
     &lt;We do not do such things in the monastery except for healing purposes.&gt;
     &lt;Hey, stop that.&gt;
     &lt;Stop what?&gt;
     &lt;*THAT*&gt;
     &lt;That is, as I said, the overmind.&gt;
     &lt;Ma&#39;am, I don&#39;t care who it is, that&#39;s not a power you want to be tossing
around at random.  It&#39;s the same with Tempest&#39;s control over the weather, you
sort of need a very steady hand for it.&gt;
     &lt;Speaking of which, is that the storm front?  Right here?&gt;
     &lt;Yes.  Try not to disturb it, please, it took me the better part of the
night to line it up like that.&gt;
     &lt;Umm, General Al&#39;vexi?  You know this is only going to get worse once we
add Alani to the mesh, right?  With her boosting ability....&gt;
     &lt;Everyone listen carefully.  Focus on your individual powers and let the
three of us worry about the overmind.  Managing it will not be easy, but as
long as you maintain focus on your powers there will not be any problems.  It
will be like a child-mind when it awakens, curious and inquisitive, and will
probably attempt to examine everything.  Be firm with it but not harsh.  Rune,
both you and Si&#39;ren must avoid trying to dominate it.&gt;
     &lt;Wait, why am I being singled out here?  I&#39;ll be focused on the water.&gt;
     &lt;The nature of command, Admiral, nothing more.  When was the last time you
took orders from a child?  The overmind will control events, not you or anyone
else.  Granted you, Tempest, and Vol will direct the overmind, but it will be
the one to execute the collective will.  Remember that.&gt;
     &lt;Question....&gt;
     [ . . ]
     &lt;Yes?&gt;
     &lt;Man, that was creepy.&gt;
     &lt;The mesh-depth is sufficient for the moment, but what about when Alani is
added?  Do you think the sudden augmentation will deepen it by accident?&gt;
     &lt;....&gt;
     &lt;That&#39;s not comforting, Al.&gt;
     &lt;Unknown, Ensign, but I understand your concerns.&gt;
     &lt;Think we should construct intellect barriers?&gt;
     &lt;If you believe the effort is worthwhile and that they will hold against
an overmind powered by three telepaths and augmented by two different sources.&gt;
     &lt;Wait, just what are we going to unleash here?&gt;
     &lt;Hey, don&#39;t poke it!&gt;
     [. . .]
     &lt;Just let it be, it will become cognizant soon enough.&gt;
     &lt;Perhaps I should have my Order look into the benefits of having our minds
meshed together like this.  It has the potential to be quite enlightening.&gt;
     &lt;Well, they do say two heads are better than one.&gt;
     &lt;So what happens when you merge eight together...?&gt;
     &lt;Someone winds up with a very potent headache.&gt;
     [. .. ]
     &lt;Yeah, what he said.&gt;
     &lt;Sergeant Alani, please have a seat and open your mind to us.&gt;
     &lt;Here it comes, brace yourselves....&gt;
     &lt;Such faith.&gt;
     [........]
     &lt;Wow.&gt;
     &lt;Ay&#39;cha navidshi.&gt;
     &lt;Agreed.&gt;
     &lt;Whoa....&gt;
     &lt;Good morning, Sergeant, so glad you could join us.&gt;
     &lt;I take it back, I take it *all* back.  This is incredible.&gt;
     &lt;Focus.  Focus on your tasks and your powers.&gt;
     [...?]
     &lt;That&#39;s right, concentrate.  Let the rain come down to scrub the air, let
the water surge forth like a river to the crater, and let the radioactive ions
it carries be decayed into harmless dust.  Focus.  We are One Entity now.  We
can reach out as One.&gt;
     [....]
     &lt;Concentrate.  Rain.  Wind.  Water.  Ions.  Focus.  Reach out.  Act.&gt;
     [...!]

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;So, Commander,&quot; K&#39;tal said casually as he stared through his glare-proof
binoculars, &quot;You going to try to catch up to her?&quot;
     &quot;Not even in my dreams,&quot; Tolaris replied dryly as he likewise kept track
of the dust plume in the distance with a pair of filtered binoculars.  &quot;Keep in
mind that even when I was her age, I couldn&#39;t sustain that kind of speed for
more than a few seconds.  You might want to try to tell her to dial her speed
down a bit, I think she&#39;s brushing up against the sound barrier.&quot;
     &quot;So what&#39;s the downside?&quot; K&#39;tal wondered.  &quot;I mean, we&#39;re out in a fairly
open desert, nothing but mountains all around us.  The sonic boom should be
contained quite nicely.&quot;
     &quot;You see what it&#39;s doing to the sand behind her at sub-sonic speeds?&quot; the
elder Dragoon pointed out.  &quot;Keep in mind that it&#39;s probably still damp from
the rain last night.  If she goes supersonic, she&#39;ll start to trail a shockwave
behind her that will turn all that wet sand into very solid projectiles.  That
won&#39;t be a problem for us if she&#39;s down there and we&#39;re back here, but we do
still have native wildlife around here.  Ever see a sand-blasted askiri before?
It&#39;s not a pretty sight.  And once she drops below supersonic speed she will
promptly be overtaken by that very same shockwave.  While I&#39;m guessing she is
using a windburner suit and a scramjet breather, that still won&#39;t protect her
from a wall of sand slamming into her ptanka at the speed of sound.&quot;
     K&#39;tal grunted quietly.  &quot;You might have a point, at least about the local
wildlife being exposed to this, as we really don&#39;t need to wind up with some
opportunistic mess sergeant putting desert roadkill on the menu without telling
us.  However, I should like to remind you that T&#39;Hai did ask for permission for
a free-range run, which was duly granted, and last I checked free-range means
nobody tries to post a speed limit sign in your path....&quot;
     Both Dragoons blinked and glanced down at their belts as they heard the
distinctive chirp of a comm-link indicating that someone was trying to contact
them.  &quot;Strange,&quot; Tolaris said as he noticed that it was his device that was
lit up.  He quickly plucked it off his belt and toggled the switch.  &quot;Commander
Tolaris,&quot; he said calmly, still keeping one eye on the dust plume being kicked
up in the distance.
     &quot;Sorry to bother you, sir,&quot; came the voice of the current Communications
officer on duty, &quot;But the long-range sensors are picking up a possible lume in
the vicinity of the Imperial Castle and the boys over in Sciences wanted to ask
you for your help since the weather models are all still pretty unreliable for
the Central Plains region.&quot;
     Tolaris nodded absently.  &quot;Copy, I&#39;ll be on my way shortly.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Commander.  Operations out.&quot;
     &quot;Problem?&quot; K&#39;tal inquired carefully, still keeping a very careful eye on
the distant horizon.  Even with full magnification and computer-assisted lens
adjusting, T&#39;Hai&#39;s figure was little more than a two-pixel blur in the remote
distance as she ran at a speed very few living denizens were capable of doing
even with their Chaos Factor powers.
     &quot;It looks like someone is creating a lume around the Imperial Castle,&quot;
Tolaris replied.  &quot;Sciences apparently thinks I can explain something to them
given my weather-control powers.&quot;
     &quot;But you don&#39;t sound convinced,&quot; K&#39;tal pointed out as a statement rather
than a question.
     Tolaris shrugged and refocused his binoculars.  &quot;If it really is a lume,
then it will do whatever the controller wants it to do, laws of physics being
largely damned for the most part.&quot;
     &quot;And if it happens to be a natural event?&quot; K&#39;tal prodded.
     &quot;Then it will still do as it damn well pleases,&quot; Tolaris replied with a
faint smile.  &quot;Just with a little more conformation to physics, that&#39;s all.&quot;
     It took K&#39;tal a fair amount of effort not to laugh aloud, settling instead
for a very quiet chuckle that was mostly suppressed in his chest.  &quot;You&#39;re a
piece of work, you know that?&quot; he drawled.
     &quot;It&#39;s hardly my fault that weather patterns are complicated entities,&quot; the
other Dragoon replied with a shrug of dismissal.  &quot;I still think that it has a
lot to do with the gravity wells of our three moons, or at least the mechanism
that keeps them moving around so erratically.  If they ever decided to settle
down into predictable and stable orbits, weather-forecasting will most likely
get a lot simpler and with far more accuracy.&quot;
     &quot;So how easy and accurate is it with just one moon?&quot; K&#39;tal mused quietly.
     Tolaris tilted his head back slightly to allow him to cast a sidelong look
at his fellow Dragoon.  &quot;Something on your mind, Commander?&quot; he asked in a
perfectly neutral tone.
     K&#39;tal sighed softly to himself, still keeping his gaze focused on the
distant desert horizon.  &quot;I didn&#39;t sleep too well last night.  Not that such a
thing is a rare occurrence, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve had your fair share of sleepless
nights as the Dragoon Commander, but no matter.  In any case, while I was busy
playing the count-the-ceiling-tile game, I was thinking about what to do with
our Crown Prince and his half-denizen Moon Princess.  Oh, did I remember to
mention that they contacted us last night?&quot; he added in an uneasy tone.
     &quot;What?&quot; Tolaris said, whipping his head around to give him a slightly
startled look.
     &quot;Guess not,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he lowered his binoculars and switched them
off.  &quot;You were still on the roof playing in the rain with the avians at the
time and I must have gotten distracted with that Engineering report.  I spoke
with.... Ami, is it?  Blue-haired girl?&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s her,&quot; Tolaris affirmed with a slow nod.
     &quot;Not something you see everyday, but no matter,&quot; K&#39;tal continued.  &quot;The
communicator units you and Maze left in my office started beeping, so I got a
little curious and pushed the blinking icon-button.  Her image appeared in the
display window and we had a bit of a conversation for a few minutes.  Princess
Serena is reported to be very much alive and well, and that they still have her
genetic data readily available for us.  She mentioned that Maze would know how
to set up a suitable data terminal for transmission and access.&quot;
     &quot;He should, seeing how he helped her with the design and construction of
the communication interface between her computer and the main computer core in
the cathedral,&quot; Tolaris agreed.  &quot;Go on.&quot;
     &quot;I asked if they would be willing to meet with us,&quot; K&#39;tal continued in an
uneasy tone.  &quot;You know, for a formal introduction during a mass formation.
She said they could arrange that, but only on one condition.... that once our
meeting is done that we escort them over to Ka&#39;an-Nul.&quot;
     &quot;Ka&#39;an-Nul?&quot; Tolaris echoed, blinking hard.  &quot;Did she say why?&quot;
     &quot;Nope,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a helpless shrug.  &quot;She said she needed to go
finish her studies and that dinner was liable to be ready soon, so we ended the
conversation at that point.  I figured that the &#39;why&#39; wasn&#39;t too important to
worry about at the time, as I was more concerned with the group meeting.  But
now that I&#39;ve had some free time to stop and really think about it, something
about their request is giving me a faint chill.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, like why Ka&#39;an-Nul of all places,&quot; Tolaris grunted quietly.  &quot;I can
easily see Mount Arachen or maybe even the ruins of places we talked about like
Asleen and Mintaka, but Ka&#39;an-Nul....&quot;
     &quot;You think they know something we don&#39;t?&quot; K&#39;tal suggested.  He blinked in
surprise as Tolaris chuckled very quietly to himself and held his binoculars
back up to his eyes.
     &quot;When it comes to humans, K&#39;tal, anything is possible,&quot; he murmured.
     &quot;And half-humans?&quot; K&#39;tal prodded carefully.
     &quot;They&#39;re even more unpredictable,&quot; Tolaris sighed as he started to scan
the terrain for the dust plume T&#39;Hai would be kicking up behind her if she was
still running at superspeed.
     &quot;Umm, you sound like you&#39;re saying there&#39;s more than one,&quot; K&#39;tal said in
a very careful tone.
     &quot;What, more than one person with only a single human parent?&quot; Tolaris
replied calmly.  &quot;Absolutely, I happen to know three off the top of my head.
Serena, of course, is a human-denizen hybrid, but Susan and her sister Lisa are
both human-demon hybrids.&quot;
     &quot;Who and what?&quot; K&#39;tal echoed, giving him a distinctly confused look.
     Tolaris paused for a moment as he realized that it was likely that he had
just said a little more than he had intended to.  &quot;I&#39;ll let them explain it to
you if you ever meet them,&quot; he finally said after a short silence.  &quot;But as far
as half-denizen individuals, Serena is the only one I&#39;m aware of.&quot;
     K&#39;tal grunted very quietly to himself.  &quot;The general population is most
likely going to have a collective gas-cramp when that little secret gets out,&quot;
he warned softly.  &quot;And just between you, me, and the sand here, I don&#39;t think
we can keep it quiet for much longer.  Too many people know.&quot;
     &quot;So what would you have us do, then?&quot; Tolaris prodded the other denizen
carefully.  &quot;Do a global broadcast containing that information?&quot;
     &quot;Not without absolutely rock-solid proof first,&quot; K&#39;tal countered.  &quot;Don&#39;t
get me wrong, I personally have no problems going on your word whatsoever as
I&#39;ve known you long enough to know you wouldn&#39;t try to dump a pile of navidshi
into anyone&#39;s lap.  I know Maze is the kind of guy to play along with a wide
range of jokes and the like, but Ra&#39;vel certainly isn&#39;t, and having the three
of you solemnly swear to the same thing means that you honestly and truly are
convinced of its validity.  But as I said earlier, sometimes you still need to
have the proof examined under a microscope regardless.&quot;
     &quot;Which will happen as soon as we can arrange the meeting,&quot; Tolaris replied
with a nod of understanding.  &quot;That part was never in question.  What we really
need an answer to, however, is the question of what to do with that information
once it is verified.&quot;
     &quot;Wait and see what happens?&quot; K&#39;tal suggested.  &quot;Honestly, Tolaris, I&#39;m not
sure that we should do anything with it.  Consider what will happen once the
common denizen in the village street finds out....&quot;
     &quot;Honestly, K&#39;tal, do you ever stop to listen to yourself?&quot; Tolaris sighed
quietly as he lowered his binoculars and turned to face his fellow Dragoon.
&quot;You just said that it will get out eventually, as far too many people know for
it to be kept quiet for much longer.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; K&#39;tal admitted.  &quot;But do we need to be the ones unlocking
the gate to let pure chaos surge forth?&quot;
     &quot;That depends on how the people take it,&quot; Tolaris said carefully.  &quot;And
how it is viewed will depend largely on how they receive that information.  If
we were to release it ourselves along with the proof of her heritage and then
present our views as to how it should be understood and accepted....&quot;
     K&#39;tal blinked hard and regarded the elder Dragoon carefully.  &quot;I thought
you hated to put a bias on published information,&quot; he said slowly.
     &quot;When I am asked for facts, I give only facts,&quot; Tolaris explained calmly.
&quot;When I am asked for my opinion, I give both my opinion and the facts used to
formulate it.  When asked for an official policy recommendation, I give that
and cite the factual basis for my conclusions.&quot;
     &quot;Okay, that&#39;s certainly acceptable,&quot; K&#39;tal said after a slight hesitation.
&quot;So what exactly are we being asked to do for this one?&quot;
     &quot;Excuse me, Commander, but I don&#39;t recall someone asking us for anything
of the sort,&quot; Tolaris said in a mildly diplomatic tone.  &quot;At least, I myself am
unaware of it.  Do you happen to know of such a request?&quot;
     It took K&#39;tal a few moments to figure out what precisely he was saying,
and more importantly, what he was implying by what he didn&#39;t say.  &quot;Like I keep
saying, Tolaris, you&#39;re a piece of work,&quot; K&#39;tal chuckled as he shook his head.
     Tolaris shrugged absently.  &quot;No offense, K&#39;tal, but I don&#39;t think I was
screened for the job of Dragoon Commander based on my looks.  That might work
for Hospitality and Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet, but not the Intelligence field.&quot;
     &quot;Ouch,&quot; K&#39;tal winced.  &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll appreciate hearing that comment.&quot;
     &quot;Which she won&#39;t if you have any decency,&quot; Tolaris smirked.  &quot;Besides,
just try to prove to me that physical appeal doesn&#39;t have its own weight when
it comes to a service division like Hospitality.&quot;
     &quot;No, no, I&#39;ve seen the reports, I believe you,&quot; K&#39;tal replied quickly.  He
paused for a moment before clearing his throat quietly.  &quot;You know, speaking
loosely of Dragoon Commanders, isn&#39;t Commander D&#39;ael supposedly at Ka&#39;an-Nul
these days?  You know, after his retirement and all?&quot;
     That caused Tolaris to stop and think for a moment.  &quot;Last I bothered to
check, I believe so,&quot; he replied slowly.  &quot;Why?&quot;
     K&#39;tal shrugged and scratched his cheek absently.  &quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know, I was
just thinking that if we were planning on dropping by the region, we might as
well be polite and pay him a visit for old-time&#39;s sake.  He&#39;d have to be told
of our visit in advance, of course, as you really don&#39;t want to just drop in on
a monk unannounced or anything.  They tend to strongly dislike having their
little moments of inner-peace disturbed and all that.&quot;
     Tolaris&#39; eyebrows arched up as he thought about it.  &quot;You know, that might
not be a bad idea at all.  I don&#39;t know if he&#39;ll be overly thrilled to see you
or me, given the stress he was under when he decided to resign, but I&#39;m sure he
will be suitably discreet about any such visit arrangements made in advance.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps even a guided tour?&quot; K&#39;tal suggested lightly.  &quot;A small group at
most, of course, maybe a dozen or so.  It is, after all, a bit of a tourist
attraction for the view from the peak observatory if nothing else.  And I&#39;m
reasonably sure that if someone anal like General Rune happens to get wind of
our plans for a bit of an impromptu visit, she should be able to understand and
maybe even appreciate our decision to take the scenic route home.  Especially
if we send her a copy of the pictures....&quot;
     &quot;Let&#39;s not get ahead of ourselves, Commander,&quot; Tolaris warned quietly.
&quot;Worry about cleaning up the last traces of radiation first, then work on the
hull and engine shrouds.  We have to be capable of travel first before we can
properly consider any plans to actually do so.&quot;
     &quot;Cut you a deal?&quot; K&#39;tal asked casually as he turned his binoculars on and
started to search for T&#39;Hai&#39;s dust plume again.  &quot;You worry about getting us
cleaned up and mobile again, and I&#39;ll worry about coordinating things with the
monks at Ka&#39;an-Nul and the paper-pushers in the Imperial Castle.  They will be
asking questions if we fire up the mains and start meandering around without a
flight-plan, you know,&quot; he warned.  &quot;Or if not them, then at least Air Traffic
Control North will want to know.&quot;
     &quot;Let you handle external affairs while I deal with internal affairs?&quot; the
other Dragoon paraphrased after a moment of careful thought.
     &quot;It can work,&quot; K&#39;tal nodded slowly.  &quot;That way we won&#39;t be stepping on one
another&#39;s toes.  We will at some point have to work this rank thing out to a
more definite degree, but just between the two of us I&#39;m in no real rush.  You
know how it goes, there would have to be paperwork out the ptanka, we&#39;d have to
get General Rune to sign off on it since it&#39;ll be a division-level posting....&quot;
     Tolaris grunted quietly, knowing that K&#39;tal wasn&#39;t making an idle joke
about the level of paperwork likely to be involved in such a thing.  &quot;I think
I can live with that,&quot; he said calmly.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s assume that the Sailor
Scouts won&#39;t be free until their weekend.  Seeing how the week just started,
it will be five days at the earliest before this can happen.  I&#39;m fairly sure
we can have the engine ducts cleaned out and the facility made mobile again by
then.  Or at least we can attempt a launch,&quot; he added in a sober tone.  &quot;There
might be a problem when we fire up the mains and promptly liquefy all the sand
in a thirty-ke&#39;shel radius of the vents....&quot;
     K&#39;tal shrugged in indifference.  &quot;Work something out with Sector Seven?&quot;
he suggested.  &quot;It&#39;s their sand, after all, not to mention their mess to clean
up once we depart.  Oh, and Chief Octane asked me last night to pass along her
thanks for those bottles we found lying around next to the reactor heat sinks.
Seems you were right about that hot spot.  Oddest thing.... oh, and it gets
even better.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Tolaris inquired in a neutral tone, suddenly wary of what sandbag
was going to be dropped on his toes this time.
     &quot;We, being the senior Dragoon officers, have been invited to accompany our
Sector Seven sisters tonight over to the local drinking establishment in Sector
One, a pub by the charming name of the Biased Bastard.  It seems that one of
them is.... shall we say, a hobbyist at the performing arts and is scheduled to
take the stage tonight.  You know who T&#39;Del is, right?&quot; he added lightly.
     It took a few seconds for the full meaning of the entire conversation to
properly register on Tolaris&#39; mind.  &quot;T&#39;Del?&quot; he echoed, giving K&#39;tal a stunned
look.  &quot;The redhead?  Fusion specialist?  SHE is here?  Performing in a bar?&quot;
     K&#39;tal couldn&#39;t help the smile that crossed his face at seeing the usually
calm and reserved Tolaris completely blowing several mental fuses all at once.
&quot;It&#39;s nice to know life on Earth hasn&#39;t completely ruined you,&quot; he chuckled.
&quot;Yes, yes, yes, and yes, respectively.  She and the rest of Sector Seven will
be joining us for lunch in the cafeteria, since we&#39;re stocked with foodstuffs
they haven&#39;t had in months and all.  The evening performance is being kept as
quiet as possible, however, as we don&#39;t need a horde of off-duty Dragoons all
mobbing the bar without any advanced notice.  Civilian clothes for that, by the
way, I understand the bar takes a dim view on rank and uniforms.  Something
about not mixing business and pleasure, which I can understand.  You want to
pick your jaw up now, Commander?  It&#39;s unsightly, not to mention you&#39;re asking
for sand to wind up wedged between your teeth in this desert environ....&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s odd,&quot; Tolaris said quietly, only half-listening to what K&#39;tal was
saying.  &quot;Why would they let T&#39;Del work all the way out here in the middle of
nowhere?  And as a simple vehicle mechanic?  That makes absolutely no sense at
all.... unless....&quot;
     &quot;Commander?&quot; K&#39;tal prodded carefully as he saw Tolaris start to space out.
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; Tolaris mused to himself.  &quot;Perhaps there is far more to
this whole situation than I had thought.  I wonder if her file has been updated
recently?  Carry on, Commander,&quot; he said absently as he started to head back
inside the open cargo bay.
     K&#39;tal watched him go before sighing softly and shaking his head.  &quot;Had I
known talking about T&#39;Del could throw you for a loop that easily, I&#39;d have done
it decades earlier,&quot; he muttered as he refocused on what Cadet T&#39;Hai was doing
several dozen miles in the distance.  &quot;But that&#39;s T&#39;Del for you.  Alright, my
little supersonic cadet, where are you now?  Oh, heading back now, are we?  I
hope you slow down before you get too close.  Bad enough we have sand in the
intakes, we don&#39;t need sand being blown into the cargo bays as well....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;You&#39;re going to love this one,&quot; Leda said quietly to Ami as she paused
on her way to her seat in the third aisle.  &quot;New student from Nova Scotia....&quot;
     &quot;Halifax, Canada,&quot; Ami replied absently without looking up from her open
science textbook.
     &quot;Cool, I was wondering where that was,&quot; Leda smirked, feeling pleased with
herself for not having to put her ignorance of geography out on display.  &quot;So
anyway, she&#39;s pretty damn cute by anyone&#39;s standards, especially the guys, and
she&#39;s already made friends with Serena and Mina since this morning.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ami said, finally lifting her head up and blinking to refocus on the
brunette.  &quot;That was fast.  Not that it takes long for either of them to start
up a friendly conversation, but still.... oh, that must be her,&quot; she added as
she leaned to the side to look around Leda&#39;s hip.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Leda murmured as she glanced over her shoulder.  &quot;Oh, cool, she&#39;s
in this class as well.  Yes, that&#39;s her.  Lilibeth Azmodan, prefers to go by
Lily.  Huh, she&#39;s about the right color as one, too, just now noticed this.&quot;
     Ami paused for a moment and cast a sidelong glance at her.  &quot;You should
sit down, class is about to start,&quot; she suggested calmly.  She then froze as
Lily glanced in her direction, feeling a deep chill course through her veins as
their eyes made contact.  For one horrid moment she thought that her vampiric
nature was going to try to wake up, but it merely did the equivalent of rolling
over onto its other side and going back to contented sleep.
     The quiet ringing of the bell snapped Ami out of her momentary paralysis,
resulting in a furious dash by Leda to reach her seat before the teacher walked
in the door.  The brunette&#39;s haste was unnecessary, as it was a good minute or
two before the science teacher finally made an appearance.  There was a very
brief introduction of the new student to the class, at which point Lily was
asked to take the empty spot three seats behind Ami.
     Another deep chill flooded Ami&#39;s veins as Lily passed by her, pausing for
a brief moment to smile at the blue-haired student before continuing.  It took
Ami an additional second to fully recover her senses, but the faint lingering
chill in her blood simply wouldn&#39;t be dispelled no matter how hard she tried to
throw it off.
     Something&#39;s wrong, she kept thinking during the entire class, finding it
extremely difficult to concentrate for some reason.  She could tell that the
dark part of her was unsettled by something, but not enough to truly cause it
to be a problem.  Logically she figured that it had something to do with the
new arrival, as she hasn&#39;t experienced anything like this previously, but she
also couldn&#39;t discount something else being the cause.  Like Leda, she too had
heard more than one casual observation that Serena was clearly edgy today about
something, so it was possible that she could be experiencing the same sort of
unidentifiable unease.
     I&#39;ll have to ask Serena about it during lunch, she finally decided as she
tried to return to the current lesson being taught.  The back of her mind was
still trying to warn her of something, however, and more than once she felt the
hair on the back of her neck start to tingle as if something was watching her.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Ms. Hino?&quot; the voice said in a deceptively casual tone, jolting Rei out
of the super-light meditative trance she had slipped into.
     &quot;X-squared minus eight-X plus sixteen,&quot; Rei said quickly, rewinding her
short-term memory and letting the rest of her subconscious mind speak freely.
     &quot;And the value for X?&quot; the teacher prompted, giving Rei a nonplussed look.
     &quot;X equals negative four,&quot; Rei replied, giving the math teacher a look that
was completely devoid of any semblance of emotion.
     &quot;Correct,&quot; the teacher said simply with a mental shrug.  To her, it seemed
that Rei had been daydreaming, but obviously she wasn&#39;t if she was still able
to follow along with the rest of the class.  &quot;Ms. Vale, problem five, please.&quot;
     Rei breathed a silent sigh of relief as Willow began to recite the next
equation and solution.  She had long ago learned how to bring her subconscious
mind into a slightly more active role in things, allowing it to pay attention
to her surroundings to a certain degree even while she was somewhat distracted
with other thoughts.  A response still required her to refocus her conscious
mind on the task, but she was getting markedly better at making the transition
appear to be perfectly seamless.  Now if she could only get her subconscious
mind to take the tests for her....
     Damn it, she thought quietly as the ghost-like chill drifted past her yet
again.  The feeling had been plaguing her since school started, a vague feeling
of general unease that seemed to come and go at irregular intervals.  It was
getting to the point of distraction now, and she wasn&#39;t sure how much longer
she would be able to keep herself focused on her schoolwork.  I really hope it
isn&#39;t Serena&#39;s fault, she thought darkly.  Granted I never felt anything like
this from her before, but with that new angel form of hers....
     &quot;Correct,&quot; the teacher said dryly, snapping her out of her thoughts yet
again.  &quot;Last problem.  Mr. Yoshii, number twelve, please.&quot;
     Damn it, Rei thought again with a heavy sigh.  Why do I keep feeling like
something is here?  None of my wards reacts to anything, so it&#39;s not that, she
added, absently brushing her fingertips over the spot on her blouse where she
kept her spiritual wards hidden away.  I might have to ask Ami at lunch if she
can do a scan with her computer, maybe there&#39;s something around here after all
that&#39;s just being a pain in the butt.... like Serena.  That&#39;d be a laugh....

                *               *               *               *

     Michelle was absently humming to herself as she finished washing the pots
and pans in the sink.  It wasn&#39;t the most pleasant of tasks to be doing at the
moment, but like the laundry downstairs it was one of those &#39;somebody has to do
it&#39; jobs.  And seeing how Alex and Whisper were already taking care of that, it
only made sense for her to tackle the mess in the kitchen.
     She had just finished drying the skillet and was about to ask Myst an idle
question when she caught motion out of the corner of her eye.  She turned to
get a better look and nearly leapt out of her skin as Susan walked into the
kitchen as silently as any ghost.
     &quot;Yeeep!&quot; she squealed before she could get ahold of herself.  &quot;Oh, Susan!&quot;
     Susan blinked at the unexpected reaction before sighing quietly.  &quot;Forgive
me, I thought you were already aware of my presence,&quot; she said demurely as she
held up a clipboard with several forms attached.  &quot;Or were you not paying close
attention to when Myst greeted me several minutes ago?&quot; she inquired archly.
     &quot;I....&quot; Michelle stammered as she glanced over at the gray kitten calmly
preening her tail.  &quot;I must have missed that.  I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she apologized.
     &quot;No matter.  I need your signature on these documents,&quot; Susan explained.
&quot;They will serve as your identity records in this era.  Unless you have any
particular objections, your official place of birth will be the coastal city of
Constanta, Romania.  That is close to where your father was from, if my memory
is accurate,&quot; she added.
     &quot;Oh!&quot; Michelle exclaimed as her eyes went wide.  &quot;You took us there once
before, didn&#39;t you?  Back when I was still a little girl?&quot;
     &quot;I did,&quot; Susan replied with a small smile.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised you remember,
as you were only seven at the time.  Alex, of course, remembers next to nothing
of the visits to Reykjavik, Iceland, which is where she will be listed as being
born in.&quot;
     Michelle paused and peered at the documents closely, blinking when she saw
Alex&#39;s full signature on half of them.  &quot;You got her to sign it as Alexis?&quot; she
inquired carefully, giving Susan an amazed look.  &quot;That must have been fun.&quot;
     &quot;As I explained to her, these are legal documents,&quot; Susan replied with a
faint smile.  &quot;And her full legal name is required for such things.  Here,&quot; she
added as she handed a pen to Michelle.  &quot;This is your contemporary-era birth
certificate, which will be discreetly filed in the main hospital in Constanta.
These are your immigration papers, saying that you came to Japan with your
mother when you were three and thus hold dual-citizenship.  It will be several
more days before I can arrange for your passport, unfortunately, so you won&#39;t
be taking any international trips anytime soon.  Sign here, please?&quot;
     Michelle paused and regarded the succubus carefully, absently making note
of the rather pleasing lines of her dark green business suit.  &quot;You&#39;re in an
unusually cheerful mood today,&quot; she observed with a soft smile as she carefully
penned her signature.
     &quot;There is always satisfaction to be taken from the successful completion
of a task, no matter what magnitude,&quot; Susan replied.  &quot;Since last night, I have
been able to take care of several such matters of importance in rather rapid
succession.  And as soon as I am finished collecting your signatures, I can
resume the process of seeding your identities into the bureaucratic system and
thus be permitted to set even more events into motion.  I anticipate that I
will remain preoccupied for most of the week, but by the week&#39;s end there will
be much accomplished that you and Alex will find to your liking.  Financial
matters, certainly, and perhaps even residential ones as well, although I must
admit that I haven&#39;t looked very closely at that one as of yet.  May I ask why
you are smiling at me like that?&quot;
     Michelle couldn&#39;t help the soft giggle that rose up from her chest.  &quot;I&#39;m
sorry,&quot; she said, not sounding the least bit apologetic.  &quot;It&#39;s just that you
don&#39;t seem to be in this cheerful of a mood very often.  Usually you&#39;re all
quiet and gloomy.  Or at least quiet,&quot; she amended hastily as she noticed the
change in Susan&#39;s expression at her words.
     &quot;As I said,&quot; Susan said dryly, &quot;There has been a great deal that has taken
place since last night that has been.... satisfying,&quot; she said, her cheeks
suddenly taking on an uncharacteristic blush.  She quickly rifled through the
forms to make sure that Michelle had signed them all, unaware of the knowing
look on Michelle&#39;s face.  &quot;Ahh, I believe that is sufficient, at least for the
present.  I shall return if I encounter anything.... else....&quot;
     Michelle blinked at the way Susan trailed off, apparently distracted by
something in the hallway.  She turned to look and blinked again as a truly
massive pile of sheets and towels seemed to be migrating down the hallway in a
very slow and unsteady manner.  It was only by taking a closer look did she
realize that they were being carried by Whisper&#39;s telekinetic powers as they
floated dangerously close to the ground.
     &quot;Do you need a hand with that, Captain?&quot; Susan called out curiously.
     &quot;Whisper?&quot; Michelle called out a few seconds later as she heard nothing
but silence in response.  She waited until the bulk of the sheets had passed
before sticking her head out into the living room, blinking hard as she noticed
that the telepath wasn&#39;t anywhere around.  &quot;Uh, Susan....&quot;
     &lt;Michelle, you might want to stay clear of the hallway,&gt; Whisper&#39;s voice
echoed in her mind without warning.  &lt;I&#39;m moving the clean sheets and towels up
there now, but I&#39;m still down here with the dryer to fold the rest of them.
Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ve got it all under control.  I&#39;m using a sort of psychokinetic
touch-and-feel method to direct them from a distance.  Just think of it as an
advanced form of practice that I&#39;ve been neglecting as of late.  I&#39;ll be up in
a few moments to physically check on them, so just relax.&gt;
     &quot;That&#39;s interesting,&quot; Susan commented, having heard the broadcast herself.
     &quot;That&#39;s spooky,&quot; Michelle protested quietly, giving the parade of sheets
and towels a slightly uncertain look.  &quot;If she hadn&#39;t said anything, I&#39;d have
started to worry we were becoming haunted by ghosts or something.&quot;
     &quot;Nonsense,&quot; the succubus replied with a faintly reproving look.  &quot;I have
every reason to believe that I would have detected the presence of any such
poltergeist or other spectral entity by now if one was in residence.  Having
said that, I will admit to a minor amount of curiosity as to what precisely
occurred in the room with the star mosaic to leave behind that spectral aura I
can sometimes sense, but it is a minor curiosity at best.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Michelle said, giving her a startled look.
     &quot;It is an Astral dent, Michelle, nothing of significance,&quot; Susan explained
in a soothing tone.  &quot;I assure you there is no need to worry about it, as it is
a fixed and apparently immovable object.  Now then, unless there is something
you need of me, I shall be off to finish this round of paperwork.  I doubt I
will be back for lunch, as I&#39;m not sure when or where I will be by then, but I
shall make a good-faith attempt at being back at a reasonable hour for dinner.
Please try to keep Alex occupied and hence out of trouble until my return,&quot; she
instructed in a humorous tone as she made a snatching motion at the air.  The
silvery Key to Time promptly materialized in her hand and she disappeared in a
burst of light a few moments later.
     &quot;Mmmmmergh,&quot; Michelle muttered quietly to herself, casting an uneasy look
towards the part of the cathedral where the star mosaic was.  &quot;I hate it when
she does that,&quot; she complained quietly to Myst.
     &quot;Prrrrm?&quot; Myst inquired absently as she lifted her head up from her task
of preening her paws, her tongue still hanging out.
     &quot;Nevermind,&quot; Michelle sighed quietly as she turned back to the sink to see
what else she had to do.  &quot;Okay, so they&#39;re washed and dried now.  Time to see
where they all go,&quot; she said as she began opening up the various cabinets.

                *               *               *               *

     There was a fundamental truth to the saying, &#39;Timing is everything.&#39;  Time
was technically a bi-directional dimensional component, meaning one could go
forward or backwards along it.  However, it was still possible to have a small
amount of lateral motion when traversing the stream.  Such sideways motion had
no direct effect on the physical component of such travel and in fact was quite
often unconsciously used by travellers to get around certain blockages or other
obstructions in a chosen path.  However, unless the temporal &#39;equation&#39; used to
calculate a given path was likewise altered to compensate for the minor amount
of lateral motion, or the motion otherwise returned to its original value once
clear of the obstacle, the result could sometimes be different than intended.
     When the conduit opened directly in front of them, a conduit that was most
certainly not theirs and was likely a result of someone slipping into the Flow
of Time at just precisely that instant so close to their destination, they had
little choice but to dodge to the side in an attempt at avoiding a temporal
collision.  They had been on time-travelling voyages before, but never on their
own without Lady Pluto&#39;s hand to guide them to their destination.  The result
of their panicked movement was a minor but still important change in their
course, an error that wouldn&#39;t be realized until they zoomed in towards the
physical coordinates they had been aiming for and slipped into the conduit that
opened before them.
     The world reformed around them in a hard flash of blue light, a result of
exotic temporal particles instantly decaying outside of their normal eleven-
dimension environment.  When the glare faded enough to allow them to see the
world around them, they immediately got the impression that something was most
likely amiss.
     &quot;Huh,&quot; said the girl with pink hair the color of cotton-candy.  She was
holding the hand of a girl with dark purple hair, and pressed between their
hands was a brightly glowing red gem that was slowly fading away to normal
intensity.  &quot;Helen, are you sure this is the right place?&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Helen replied as she carefully let go of the other
girl&#39;s hand, keeping the red gem cupped in her palm.  &quot;You&#39;re the one who was
driving.  Speaking of which.... is it me, or did we move a little back there?&quot;
     &quot;Leave me alone, I had to move to avoid being run over,&quot; the pink-haired
girl retorted as she looked around the room with a faint scowl.  &quot;Wait, wait,
this looks like it after all.  Look, up on the ceiling.  See, that looks like
the Astroglobe that Lady Earth told us about.  You know, the one you should be
able to use your power of Astrology with?&quot;
     &quot;If it still works,&quot; Helen said dubiously.  &quot;It was broken how long ago?
Seriously, Renee, I don&#39;t think we should try to mess with it.  We&#39;re here for
a wedding, remember?  We just slip in the back, watch quietly, and slip back
out before anybody notices.  That was the deal we made with Lady Pluto.&quot;
     Renee sighed and removed her hat, revealing the pair of conical pink buns
that most of her hair had been swept up into.  The remaining portion of her
hair hung like streamers from the cones, coming down to her shoulders.  &quot;Yeah,
yeah, kitty, don&#39;t get your panties in a knot.  Here, give me that,&quot; she said
as she pointed to the now-inert red gem.  The gem was casually tossed into the
air on a gentle arc and promptly disappeared into the depths of the hat as it
sailed into the center of it.
     &quot;Hey, careful with that!&quot; Helen blurted out.
     Renee paused and gave her a bizarre look.  &quot;What, think it&#39;d break on us
or something?&quot; she inquired archly.
     &quot;You know how easy it is to lose something in that?&quot; the purple-haired
girl protested with a pout.
     Renee just rolled her pink eyes and carefully put the hat back on, making
sure that it covered her distinctive hairstyle.  &quot;You worry too much sometimes,
you know that?&quot; she sighed.  &quot;Now come on, if I did it right they should be
starting the ceremony soon so we need to start moving.  Qui-et-ly,&quot; she added
in an emphatic tone.
     &quot;I&#39;m not the one who tripped over the carpet and woke up the entire Castle
last year when we were supposed to be in bed,&quot; Helen retorted darkly as she
cast an unamused glance towards her best friend.
     &quot;I&#39;m telling you,&quot; Renee replied with an exasperated sigh, &quot;We would have
been fine if Minerva had just keep her big mouth shut.  Now come on, let&#39;s just
get going before we get....&quot;
     Both girls promptly froze as the door creaked open, allowing a truly large
stack of sheets to be carried into the chamber by Whisper.  The sheets were
piled so high that the telepath couldn&#39;t see where she was going, instead using
her psychokinetic sense to attempt to navigate her way along the corridors of
the denizen cathedral.
     &quot;....Caught,&quot; Renee muttered in a dejected tone as her blood turned to an
icy slush.
     The pile of sheets promptly fell to the floor as Whisper dropped them in
surprise, looking around the room for the source of the sound.  She spotted the
pair of girls an instant later, her eyes widening in shock at the discovery of
intruders in the cathedral without their detection by the internal sensors.
     &quot;Whisper, we can explain,&quot; Helen blurted out quickly.
     &quot;Who are you?&quot; the telepath demanded in a low tone as she tensed up, one
hand hovering near her head in preparation of focusing her mind for psionic
combat.
     Renee and Helen exchanged unhappy glances before sighing heavily in near-
perfect unison.  &quot;Long story short, we&#39;re out-of-phase,&quot; Renee said simply, as
if that explained everything.  It did to a degree, but the statement was quite
meaningless to someone who wasn&#39;t versed in the mechanics of time-travel.
     &quot;Give me the long story, then, and quickly,&quot; Whisper growled, her body
still tense with anticipation of the unknown.  &quot;Who are you and what are you
doing here?&quot;
     &quot;I am Crown Princess Renee of the Kingdom of the Moon,&quot; Renee said in a
quiet but firm voice, turning her focus inward briefly and causing the golden
crescent sigil to flare into view on her forehead.  &quot;And this is my handmaiden,
Lady Helen Tomoe-Kino.  We are from what you would call the distant future, and
we came here with the intent of observing a wedding, nothing more.&quot;
     Whisper remained perfectly motionless as she considered the implications.
She was reasonably sure that the brief flash of soft light on Renee&#39;s forehead
had been genuine, meaning that she was a descendant of the Royal House of the
Moon.  That also meant she was related somehow to Serena, which in turn meant
that somewhere along the line the concerns of her heritage and her ability to
bear children would be rendered quite moot.
     &quot;Handmaiden?&quot; Helen muttered out of the corner of her mouth.
     &quot;Hush,&quot; Renee discreetly whispered back.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; Whisper said calmly as her thoughts quit cascading enough to
let her refocus on the situation.  &quot;Say I believe you, that you two are who you
claim to be and that you are from the future.  Be that as it may, I&#39;m not aware
of any weddings taking place around here.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Renee said, blinking in surprise.  &quot;But I thought that....&quot;
     &quot;Renee?&quot; Helen interrupted in a low tone as she took the time to study her
surroundings in detail.  &quot;I think we have a slight problem on our hands.  Look
around you.  This place doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s been around for that long, now
does it?  The Astroglobe is still intact, too,&quot; she added in an ominous tone.
     The pink-haired princess blinked hard and gave Whisper an unsettled look
before she tilted her head back to study the mosaic on the ceiling.  &quot;Ummm....&quot;
she said dubiously before turning her attention back to Whisper.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s
start with the basics.... what year is this?&quot;
     The question seemed to catch the telepath off-guard, causing her to open
her mouth before freezing in place.  &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she admitted with a faint
blue blush of embarrassment.  &quot;I never really stopped to ask how the human
calendar works in relation to ours.&quot;
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Renee replied, clearly nonplussed by the answer.  She thought for
a moment before a potential solution occurred to her.  &quot;Okay, so just how old
is...?&quot; she started to say before Helen grabbed her arm and nearly yanked her
off of her feet.  &quot;Hey!  Easy, kitty, just.... huh?&quot; she said as her friend
began to quietly but furiously whisper in her ear.  &quot;Oh, good point.  So who do
we use?  Oh, I know.  Umm, Whisper?  How old is Lady Mar.... I mean, just how
old is Rei Hino at the moment?&quot;
     Whisper gave her a suspicious look before replying, &quot;Sixteen.&quot;
     &quot;WHAT?&quot; both Helen and Renee gasped in shock.  They both stared at the
telepath before Renee whirled around and swatted Helen on the shoulder.  &quot;You
sent us too far back in Time!&quot; she blurted out.
     &quot;Don&#39;t blame me, rabbit, you were the one who was driving!&quot; Helen retorted
with a dark scowl.
     &quot;I told you not to call me that,&quot; Renee fumed.
     Whisper blinked and alternated her gaze between the two girls, trying to
decide if this was an elaborate ruse of some kind or if they really were just
a pair of time-travellers who had simply taken a wrong turn.  She would have
dismissed that out of hand if it wasn&#39;t for the fact that Susan had indicated
that she herself was a time-traveller and apparently wasn&#39;t above taking others
along on a journey with her.
     &quot;Does it matter right now?&quot; Helen hissed.  &quot;We&#39;re screwed.  We missed the
mark by almost a full *decade*, and not only are we seriously out-of-phase, we
have to explain to Lady Pluto why we got caught.  She is going to *kill* us.&quot;
     &quot;Take it easy, Helen,&quot; Renee said in a soothing voice.  &quot;Look, the only
person who&#39;s seen us so far is Whisper, and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not going to tell
anyone else.  Right?&quot; she added hopefully as she leaned to one side to look at
Whisper.  &quot;You&#39;re not going to change the future time-line by telling anyone
that we were briefly here?  Please?&quot;
     Whisper raised a delicate pale green eyebrow.  &quot;I think that&#39;s already
been done now,&quot; she pointed out in a very cautious tone.
     &quot;We&#39;re dead,&quot; Helen moaned.  &quot;Lady Pluto is going to kill us both....&quot;
     &quot;Look,&quot; Renee sighed heavily, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about her, okay?  I&#39;m the Crown
Princess, let me do the worrying.  You just.... I don&#39;t know, go study the way
the star mosaic looks right now or something.  Let me handle this, alright?&quot;
     &quot;Sure, you&#39;re doing an excellent job of it so far,&quot; Helen muttered as she
glanced over at Whisper.  She paused as she noticed the rather intense look she
was receiving from the telepath and cleared her throat nervously.  &quot;Umm, why
are you looking at me like that?&quot; she inquired cautiously.
     &quot;I&#39;m trying to remember if we&#39;ve met before,&quot; Whisper replied in an uneasy
tone.  &quot;I don&#39;t think so, but I&#39;ve still got the funny feeling that we have.
You do, after all, seem to already know who I am,&quot; she pointed out.
     &quot;Maybe because you two met in the future?&quot; Renee suggested dryly.
     &quot;Renee?  Don&#39;t antagonize her, okay?&quot; Helen whispered softly.  &quot;We&#39;re in
more than enough trouble as it is, we don&#39;t need to go home with headaches.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, please,&quot; the pink-haired girl scoffed.  &quot;What denizen is going to so
much as lay a mental finger on their Cr....&quot;
     &quot;She doesn&#39;t know that!&quot; Helen hissed sharply.  &quot;None of them do!  For the
love of the Moon, you crazy bunny, *we&#39;re in the past!*&quot;
     Renee suddenly got very quiet as the realization sank in, her complexion
suddenly becoming dangerously pale.  &quot;Oh, right,&quot; she said in a small voice.
&quot;Yeah, that, umm.... might have an impact.  I think we should go home now.&quot;
     &quot;That might be for the best,&quot; Whisper suggested as she felt the beginnings
of what would soon be a headache of epic proportions start to take up residence
in her frontal lobes.  She paused and raised an eyebrow as Renee swept off her
hat to reveal the conical hairbuns.  &quot;Interesting hairstyle,&quot; she observed as
she immediately thought of Serena&#39;s &#39;meatball&#39; buns and the almost identical
streamers of hair hanging from them.
     &quot;Royal tradition,&quot; Renee muttered as she held the hat in one hand and
reached into the darkness beyond the brim with the other.  She quickly found
herself up to her shoulder as she felt around inside the artificial dimensional
field, trying to locate the small red gemstone that had been loaned to them.
     Whisper studied her carefully before shrugging in dismissal.  &quot;I can see
that happening,&quot; she admitted, remembering that Queen Serenity also used the
same general hairstyle.
     &quot;Renee?&quot; Helen prodded in a wary tone after a few seconds of silence.
     &quot;I&#39;m working on it,&quot; Renee replied, absently holding the tip of her tongue
between her teeth as she blindly felt around inside the pocket.  &quot;It&#39;s not like
I can shine a flashlight in here to make this any easier, you know?  Ah, wait,
this might be it.  Errgh,&quot; she grunted softly as she strained her arm to reach
even deeper into the field.  &quot;They made this too big,&quot; she protested.
     Helen sighed and crossed her arms over her petite chest.  &quot;That&#39;s not what
you were crabbing about last month,&quot; she grumbled.
     &quot;Well, I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d end up with THAT much Halloween candy,&quot; the
other girl replied with a sour look.  &quot;Besides, you were keeping your stash in
there too, so no wonder we had a problem with overflow.  Oh, come on,&quot; she said
tartly as she started to balance on one foot while trying to push her arm even
deeper into the void.  &quot;Great, I think it rolled into a corner.&quot;
     &quot;Careful,&quot; Helen warned.  &quot;If you fall over, I&#39;m going to laugh at you for
a week.  I might even tell Kei and Morgan so they can tag-tease you as well.&quot;
     &quot;No you&#39;re not, because I&#39;ll beat your furry butt for that long,&quot; Renee
countered.  &quot;And don&#39;t even think of telling the twins about *any* of this or
Lady Pluto really will.... aha!&quot; she said triumphantly as she stood up straight
and removed her hand from the depths of her hat.  &quot;Finally,&quot; she added as she
held up the small red gem.
     Whisper just rubbed her temples slowly.  &quot;Helen, please tell me you&#39;re
related to Rei so I can easily understand the reason you two keep going back
and forth like they keep doing in this era,&quot; she sighed.
     &quot;What?&quot; Helen said, blinking hard.  &quot;Lady Mars?  No, I&#39;m not her dau....
er, descendant.  The twins are, but that&#39;s *OW!* you stupid rabbit, what the
hell did you do that for?&quot; she yelped as Renee promptly stomped on her foot.
     &quot;To shut you up, furball,&quot; Renee said acidly.  &quot;Weren&#39;t you the one trying
to remind me two minutes ago that *we&#39;re in the past* right now?&quot;
     &quot;You didn&#39;t need to do that, though,&quot; Helen protested darkly.
     &quot;Well, if you&#39;d watch what you say....&quot; Renee countered hotly, her dark
temper starting to flare.
     &quot;Girls?&quot; Whisper sighed heavily, causing an abrupt veil of silence to fall
around the room.  &quot;Not to be rude, but just go home already before you make my
headache even.... what?&quot; she gasped, staring at the black crescent mark that
suddenly appeared Renee&#39;s forehead.
     &quot;Huh?&quot; Renee said in confusion, giving Whisper a concerned look.  &quot;What?&quot;
     &quot;Uhh, you&#39;re glowing again,&quot; Helen said in a very flat hiss.  &quot;And I don&#39;t
mean the gold one this time.&quot;
     Renee blinked hard and quickly focused her mind, causing the black moon
sigil to vanish from her forehead.  &quot;Oh, yeah, umm.... mood swing.  Temper, you
know.  It happens, heh heh....&quot; she said weakly.  She blinked hard and winced
as Helen&#39;s hand wrapped around hers, almost crushing it in a tight embrace.
&quot;Ow, hey!&quot; she protested.
     &quot;We&#39;re outta here,&quot; Helen said quickly as she concentrated on the gem.
&quot;Umm, sorry for dropping in on you like this, Whisper, please try to forget we
were here and anything you might have seen, and please don&#39;t tell Lady Pluto
about any of.... this....  Umm, Renee?&quot;
     &quot;What?  This hurts, dammit....&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not feeling any temporal energy here,&quot; Helen warned.
     &quot;Well, quit squeezing my hand so hard and let me try,&quot; Renee replied in a
cross tone.  She made a quiet huffing noise as Helen adjusted her grip so that
their palms were pressed together and their fingers intertwined.  &quot;Okay, that&#39;s
a lot better.  Now then, just let me.... handle.... this?  Umm....&quot;
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; Renee agreed in a sickened tone.
     Whisper paused and frowned as an icy chill started to crawl down her back.
&quot;What&#39;s the problem, girls?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     Helen and Renee exchanged uneasy glances before they took a step back,
Renee cupping the gemstone in her hand and studying it carefully.  &quot;It&#39;s not
glowing anymore,&quot; she said in a sullen tone.
     &quot;Meaning?&quot; Helen prompted.
     &quot;I think we might have used up all the energy getting here, &quot; Renee said
in a tentative tone.  &quot;After all, we travelled further back than expected....&quot;
     Helen moaned softly as she buried her face in her hands.  &quot;Oh, great,&quot; she
sighed.  &quot;If Lady Pluto wasn&#39;t going to be happy with our screw-up before, she
is absolutely going to have a litter of kittens now.  How are we supposed to
get ourselves out of this one?&quot;
     &quot;Umm.... ask the Lady Pluto of this era?&quot; Renee suggested weakly.  &quot;Surely
she can time-travel just as easily too, right?&quot;
     &quot;But not into the Silence,&quot; Helen said dourly.  &quot;That&#39;s why she let us
borrow the gem in the first place, remember?  Reverse-vector homing and all
that fun stuff?&quot;
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Renee whispered very softly.  &quot;Well, maybe she can recharge this
thing or something?&quot; she asked as she gave Whisper a hopeful look.
     &quot;She&#39;s not here right now,&quot; Whisper pointed out.  &quot;In fact, she told us
not to expect her back until dinner, and that won&#39;t be for several hours.&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;re dead,&quot; Helen said in a flat tone.  &quot;We are so dead, and the gods
help us if we run into any of the others before then.&quot;
     &quot;Helen?&quot; Renee sighed.  &quot;I know you&#39;re an Astrologer and everything, but
can you put a lid on the doomsday prophecies for once?  It isn&#39;t helping.  Can
you try raising her on the communicator network?  That should still be working
properly in this time period.... right?&quot;
     Whisper paused for a moment as the chill in her blood became even deeper.
&quot;My communicator works just fine, last I checked,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;However,
I don&#39;t think one has been built for Susan just yet.&quot;
     Renee grumbled quietly to herself as she rubbed the bridge of her nose.
&quot;You&#39;re not making this easy for me, are you?&quot; she muttered darkly.  She then
had to make a quick grabbing motion as the gemstone started to vibrate hard,
almost leaping out of her hand.  &quot;Hey, what gives?&quot; she protested.
     Helen paused and regarded her carefully.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you actually got
worse with that clumsy can&#39;t-do-two-things-at-once problem of yours,&quot; she said
with a sigh.  &quot;You&#39;re standing perfectly still and yet you still managed to
start fumbling it?  You chewing gum again or something?&quot;
     &quot;Oh, shut up,&quot; Renee groaned with a sigh of her own.  &quot;It&#39;s not MY fault
that this thing just started shaking all of a sudden.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Helen gasped, her face turning a sickly shade of white.  &quot;It
started resonating?  You know what that means?!&quot;
     &quot;Resonating?&quot; Renee echoed in confusion before she likewise turned pale.
&quot;But that would mean....&quot;  She fell silent for a moment before both she and
Helen turned towards the door as it creaked open.  &quot;Lady Pluto,&quot; they both said
in perfect unison with identical cringes of anticipation.
     &quot;Captain, is there...?&quot; Susan started to say with a frown before she saw
that the room was more populated than expected.  There was an initial moment of
reflexive tension before the color seemed to literally evaporate from her face.
&quot;Hotaru....&quot; she breathed in a shocked voice so soft as to almost be inaudible.
     &quot;Okay, *now* we&#39;re in trouble,&quot; Renee whimpered to Helen.
     &quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; Helen spoke up quickly as she realized what Susan&#39;s problem
was.  &quot;Chancellor, listen carefully, I&#39;m not who you think I am but I can&#39;t say
more since we&#39;re out-of-phase.&quot;
     It took Susan several moments to recover to the point where she could nod
her head fractionally in a semblance of understanding.  &quot;I-I-I see,&quot; she said
in a choked tone.  She closed her eyes and visibly tried to rally herself with
a deep breath before focusing on the visitors once again.  &quot;If you are indeed
out-of-phase with a negative temporal coefficient, then as the Guardian of Time
I demand that neither of you say anything further and immediately return to
your point of origin,&quot; she managed to say with a measure of firmness.
     &quot;We can&#39;t,&quot; Helen said very carefully, acutely aware of just how pale the
succubus was.  &quot;We overshot our target and used too much energy, or at least we
think we did.  We&#39;re going to need your help to get us back,&quot; she explained as
she pointed to the quiescent red gem in Renee&#39;s hands.
     Susan glanced over at the gem and blinked in surprise before nodding to
herself.  &quot;So that is the reason,&quot; she murmured quietly before she glanced up
at Renee.  She blinked hard again and stared at her before sighing softly.  &quot;I
will attempt to have it recharged for you, but that will require a few moments
of preparation first.  I suggest you either set the gem down or get a very firm
grip on it,&quot; she warned as she braced herself.  She waited for Renee to wrap
both hands around the gem before she made an unusually rapid and hard grabbing
motion at the air.
     &quot;Eeep!&quot; Renee squealed as the gemstone in her hand suddenly began to jerk
around the instant Susan&#39;s staff appeared.  The resonance only lasted for maybe
a tenth of a second before Susan warped out of the room, obviously trying to do
so as fast as she could manage.  &quot;Wow, that was powerful,&quot; she said to Helen
once the gem became still again.
     &quot;That was dangerous,&quot; Helen pointed out sourly, casting an uneasy glance
where Susan had been at just a moment ago.  &quot;She must have blown one heck of a
fuse if she&#39;s willing to bring the two into that close a proximity, even for a
fraction of a second.  Umm, yes?&quot; she added as she noticed the way Whisper was
staring at her.
     &quot;I knew I had seen you before,&quot; Whisper said quietly.  &quot;Only it was in a
painting Susan had done of Sailor Saturn, a girl named Hotaru.  You indeed look
like her, and I mean exactly like her.  Well, aside from the purple hair and
eyes,&quot; she amended after a moment&#39;s thought.
     A bright flash of light heralded Susan&#39;s return, holding the Key to Time
in a white-knuckled grip.  There were two gaps near the top of the heart-shaped
loop where a pair of red gemstones had once been set but had obviously been
removed at some point.  She immediately braced herself for a hasty exit, but
allowed herself to relax after several seconds when it became clear that there
wouldn&#39;t be any additional temporal resonances in the immediate future.
     &quot;There,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;I believe I can now attempt to recharge the
time crystal you are using without causing an overlap.  Would you please hand
it to me?&quot; she said to Renee, her voice wavering ever so slightly.  The gem was
wordlessly passed over to her and promptly socketed with a soft click.  &quot;Thank
you,&quot; she said absently as she closed her eyes and focused on the staff.
     &quot;Susan, are you alright?&quot; Whisper asked quietly.
     &quot;I.... should like to defer answering that question until later, if you
don&#39;t mind, Captain,&quot; Susan said in a level tone as she continued to focus on
the Key to Time.
     &quot;Meaning she&#39;s trying not to throw up,&quot; Renee muttered to Helen, drawing
a very sharp look of rebuke from the purple-haired girl.
     &quot;Silence,&quot; Susan said in an unusually crisp tone, drawing hard blinks of
surprise from the rest of the room.  &quot;You have indeed drained the crystal of
its energy, which I find to be rather incredible given the charge it usually
contains.  What I find to be more upsetting, however, is the fact that you were
more than a little careless in plotting your temporal journey through the Flow
of Time.  I only returned here because I became concerned about the potential
for harm following the near-collision I experienced several minutes ago.  I am,
quite frankly, at a loss to imagine how such an event was possible short of
gross negligence on your part as I was no doubt the one who instructed you on
how to navigate the Flow and most assuredly would not have allowed either of
you to travel on your own without having full confidence in your demonstrated
abilities to do so properly and responsibly.&quot;
     &quot;Daaaaaamn,&quot; Renee moaned quietly as she seemed to wilt like a flower.
&quot;You don&#39;t even know us and already you&#39;re starting with the lectures.  Can you
at least wait until we get home first?&quot; she pleaded.  &quot;Besides, what makes you
so sure that it wasn&#39;t your *AAAAHHHH!*&quot;
     &quot;Children, please,&quot; Whisper sighed, wincing as she watched Renee try to
recover from Helen&#39;s somewhat vicious jab to her kidney.
     &quot;Quiet before you get us both in trouble!&quot; Helen hissed darkly.
     &quot;I assure you that the both of you have already reached that point,&quot; Susan
observed in a fairly glacial tone.
     &quot;Dammit, Helen, that *HURT!*&quot; Renee snarled.
     &quot;Then bite your tongue so we can get out of here, okay?&quot; Helen retorted.
     &quot;Don&#39;t talk to me like that, I&#39;m your...!!!&quot; Renee started to say before
both she and Helen abruptly staggered back from powerful psi-spikes, giving
them instant and very strong migraine headaches.
     &quot;Girls?&quot; Whisper said calmly, hoping she hadn&#39;t just made a mistake from
using her telepathic skills on them.  &quot;Both of you please be quiet.  I&#39;m not
good at guessing a human&#39;s age, especially when they&#39;re as young as you seem to
be, but you both strike me as being in your early teenage years, which is old
enough to know how to behave like adults.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Captain,&quot; Susan said briskly as she removed the gemstone from
its socket and held it out.  &quot;Here, the crystal has been fully recharged and
should have more than enough power to return the both of you to your point of
origin.  Again, as Guardian of Time I demand that you do so and without further
delay.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Renee said in a pained whisper as she reached out to accept
the gem.  It began to glow as soon as it touched her skin, shedding a soft but
steady red light.
     &quot;Told you not to antagonize her,&quot; Helen muttered as she continued to hold
one hand to the side of her head.  Her other hand reached out to gingerly clasp
Renee&#39;s, pressing the glowing gem between their palms.  &quot;Let&#39;s just go, okay?&quot;
     &quot;See you in a couple of minutes,&quot; the pink-haired princess sighed as she
turned her focus inward, directing her thoughts towards the crystal.  A rift
was immediately torn open behind them, drawing the pair of girls inside and
sealing itself shut just as quickly as it had come.
     &quot;Susan!&quot; Whisper gasped as the succubus collapsed to her knees and seemed
to go limp.
     &quot;Tension, nothing more,&quot; Susan whispered quietly as she adjusted herself
to sit properly on the floor.  She set her staff aside and drew her knees up to
her chest, resting her forehead against her arms.  &quot;Oh, what have I allowed to
happen?&quot; she moaned softly.
     Whisper hesitated for a moment before she moved over and sat down next to
her, reaching out to grip her shoulder gently.  She blinked as she realized
that the succubus was shaking fairly hard.  &quot;Susan, take it easy, okay?&quot; she
said carefully.  &quot;Just take a deep breath and tell me what just happened.&quot;
     &quot;No,&quot; Susan replied as she shook her head violently, startling Whisper.
&quot;No, neither of us can speak further of this.  You must not speak to anyone at
all about this, not to me, not to Michelle, not to the Princess, nobody.  All
that you heard and saw here must be forgotten lest it change the past that has
already been written.&quot;
     &quot;Susan, listen to what you are saying,&quot; Whisper pointed out.  &quot;You told us
several times before that the future is not set in stone.  If they are from a
future time-period, then so what?  Whatever they said will not change *our*
past, and since their past is our future, doesn&#39;t that mean it can still be
changed?&quot;
     &quot;It is not that simple,&quot; Susan said quietly.  &quot;By changing their past,
even though it is still technically our future, they have linked themselves to
a specific temporal thread of possibility and forced it into our reality.  This
is how paradoxes are created, and unless properly broken or corrected they can
incur truly catastrophic results.  I learned this lesson the hard way, and it
is not something I can permit to happen if it is within my power to prevent.
Significant damage has already been done with the simple knowledge that they
even exist as such.  To spread that information to others would be to amplify
that damage on a geometric scale.&quot;
     &quot;Even to tell you about it?&quot; Whisper prodded carefully.
     &quot;Even to tell me about it,&quot; Susan echoed with a somber nod.  &quot;While I have
become accustomed to guarding such secrets for my entire life, they each weigh
heavily on me in their own way.  Such burdens can never be lifted until the
Moment passes the points in Time they concern, fixing events in the past and
thus rendering the concerns moot.  It dismays me more than you could possibly
know to see that you are now burdened by such a duty, but it is nonetheless a
duty for you to remain silent on all that you have seen and heard until events
come to pass as they ultimately will.  Failure to do otherwise could very well
have consequences for this world well beyond your imagination or mine.&quot;
     The telepath sat back and studied her carefully, getting the very clear
impression that the other woman absolutely believed that what she was saying
was the literal truth.  &quot;So what do I do about the curiosity I have about all
of this?&quot; she inquired carefully.  She blinked as Susan lifted her head up and
began to laugh very softly to herself, making her genuinely wonder if the other
woman&#39;s sanity was starting to fragment or at least crack around the edges.
     &quot;What do you think is the heaviest burden that must be borne?&quot; Susan said
with what was best described as remorseful irony.  &quot;I of course desire, and I
might even daresay hunger, to know who they were and what they were doing here
in this era.  However, knowing will only further prejudice me against choices
I must make in the future, and so I must avoid finding out to the best of my
ability.  Welcome to one of the many burdens I bear, Captain, and I pray that
you can endure it with less pain and suffering than I usually experience.&quot;
     Whisper sat back with a heavy sigh, absently drawing her knees up to her
chest in an unconscious mirroring of Susan&#39;s current pose.  &quot;This is giving me
a truly massive headache, you know,&quot; she pointed out as she began to massage
her temples.
     &quot;I believe I can state with authority that I share your pain,&quot; Susan said
with a faint hint of a smile.  &quot;If it is any consolation, at least you have a
greater degree of mental discipline than most others.  Try to imagine for a
moment how poorly someone like Alex might cope in this situation.&quot;
     &quot;Ask me later how well I&#39;m coping with this,&quot; Whisper replied dryly.  &quot;So
just so I understand this correctly....  I can understand being asked not to
tell anyone else, that part I&#39;m comfortable with.  But you and I can&#39;t try to
figure any of this out between us?&quot;
     Susan sighed quietly.  &quot;I&#39;m sure that we could manage to piece together a
great deal of information if we tried,&quot; she said in a muted tone.  &quot;That is,
however, precisely what I am trying to avoid as it is the information itself
that will end up prejudicing ourselves when it comes to future decisions.  I
hesitate to use words like taint or contaminate, but there will nonetheless be
a definite bias towards the thread of possibility that they originated from if
we pursue this any further than what has already been done, intentionally or
not.&quot;
     &quot;Is being biased a bad thing, though?&quot; Whisper mused.
     &quot;It can be,&quot; Susan allowed.  &quot;Is it guaranteed to be?  No, but there is
still an increased possibility of that, and as Guardian of Time is has long
been understood that one of my purposes is to ensure that the probabilities are
not artificially tampered with by external agents or influences.&quot;
     Whisper just shook her head slowly.  &quot;You&#39;re making my headache worse, you
know,&quot; she pointed out in a rueful tone.
     &quot;With all due respect, Captain,&quot; Susan said quietly as she stood up and
picked up her staff, &quot;Just imagine how I feel.  This is your first encounter
with time-travelling entities.  I&#39;ve been at this for seven hundred years now,
and being a Damned soul means that I will continue to bear these burdens until
either Time as an entity ceases to exist or I am finally claimed by the dark
abyss of oblivion.  At least you have the hope of not having to go through this
sort of experience again.  I, however, have no such comfort.  I will see you
later tonight,&quot; she added quietly before she made a gesture with the staff and
vanished in a flash of light.
     &quot;Great,&quot; the telepath muttered to herself as she rose to her feet and cast
a weary look at the forgotten array of sheets scattered over the floor.  &quot;Now
I understand why Alex keeps giving her a hard time.  Ohh, my head,&quot; she moaned
as she gingerly began to scoop the sheets up.  &quot;You know, maybe Myst is right
about things being just a little too chaotic around here after all....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     The rain continued to come down from the ink-black clouds in torrential
proportions, not so much falling as being hurled by the internal forces that
were directing it.  The windshear was not helping matters one bit, or at least
from the perspective of the ground as it was torn up by the sheer violence of
the storm.  The force of the falling rain was enough to take the paint off of
most of the unprotected buildings and terrain, and with it the layer of deadly
radioactive fallout from the nuclear blast.
     Aided by not just the super-strong winds but by a seemingly unnatural
current, the flood-like waters on the ground flowed towards the eye of the
immense storm where the pressure was dangerously low.  Like a rip-tide, the
water surged along a narrow path to wind up in a whirlpool of sorts where it
swirled around in a mad frenzy before being drawn up into the truly terrifying
funnel cloud that rotated around the perimeter of the Imperial Castle.  What
was taken up by the winds soon found itself back in the clouds, being driven
back towards the ground once again in a giant meteorological loop.  And during
the process, the radioactive ions trapped by the water began to spontaneously
decay at a rate thousands of times faster than what was normal, essentially
rendering them largely harmless.
     The process was moving very slowly, but it was nonetheless working as it
was intended to do.  The creation of the stationary mega-tornado that spun with
the Imperial Castle safely ensconced in the center of the vortex had been the
surprising but highly effective idea of the overmind itself, boosting the
efficiency of the water-movement process.
     &lt;So far, so good,&gt; Tempest thought to the rest of the group as she kept a
very careful eye on the internal pressure of the whirling cyclone.  &lt;Admiral,
Pa&#39;an, let me know if you start to feel fatigued or run into problems and I&#39;ll
try to convince Junior ease off on the tornado.&gt;
     &lt;Copy,&gt; Si&#39;ren thought simply as she remained focused on her work.
     &lt;I am doing just fine,&gt; Vol assured her calmly.
     General Rune remained perfectly silent as she listened to what was going
on in the psionic mesh.  The conversation between Si&#39;ren, Tempest, Alani, and
Vol was clearly audible to everyone, while the distinctly muted communications
between the three telepaths was kept to an almost subconscious level so that
their coordination wouldn&#39;t disturb anyone else.  The child-like instincts of
the overmind had its own mental feel to it, not so much heard as a distinctive
sound but was rather felt as background noise like the call of nature when in
a forest.  And now that Al&#39;vexi was too distracted to maintain the psionic
thought-barrier that had been shielding Rune from the synaptic static inherent
to telepathic activity, she could also hear a fourth level of communication,
barely more than the hum of an electric device way off in the distance: the
sound of Ael&#39;ien&#39;s mind as she communicated with K&#39;tal through the psionic bond
that they shared.
     And what are you saying, Captain? Rune wondered as she focused on the very
subtle humming sound.  Are you doing what you are supposed to do, finding out
what his plans are and determining if he has betrayed us?  Or are you plotting
with him even now to commit treason?  How can I trust you now that your mind is
tied to his?  Do you think like he does now?  Will you in time betray me as I
suspect our Dragoons soon will?  Will you betray me for her sake, for that of
the Moon Princess?
     Damn you, Nop&#39;tera, she fumed quietly, able to feel the residual ache in
her hand despite being immersed in the depths of the overmind mesh.  What is so
special about her that blinds you to the danger she poses?  Even the NegaForce
admits she is a danger, yet instead of killing her to ensure that the threat is
negated, you wish to protect her?  To put her on the throne as Queen-Regent?
     Darian, she thought quietly.  Prince Darian is the key to everything now.
I can easily see what Beryl saw in him, and not just from a physical standpoint
either.  But would it be enough for me?  Could I live with him as my Prince?
Allow him to be the one to share the rest of my life with?  Beryl thought so,
and she had to break his mind to do it, but look what it did to her.  Who among
us couldn&#39;t see how she was changed by him?  Are these humans really that....
that powerful, that dangerous, to affect us as such?  Look what they&#39;ve done to
denizens like Tolaris.
     Tolaris.... he was a loyal soldier and a dedicated Dragoon.  Now he&#39;s a
traitor, and for what?  Sailor Mercury?  A lone human girl who by all rights is
still a child?  And what of the others who followed in his footsteps, the other
denizen exiles?  Maze, Ra&#39;vel, Whisper?  Perhaps Maze could be charmed by one
of them as Tolaris could, both being men, but what about a woman like Whisper?
She was married for centuries and her husband was killed by the Sailor Scouts.
And yet she allies herself with them now?  And what of an avian like Ra&#39;vel?
What could she possibly see in humans?  What are they seeing?  Why?  Could it
all be.... her?
     Rune sighed mentally as the thoughts and doubts continued to swirl around
inside the depths of her mind.  What is so special about Sailor Moon? she all
but yelled into the empty silence around her, not daring to let the thoughts
slip into the psionic mesh surrounding the uppermost layer of her mind.  What
is so special about these humans that affects us so?
     &lt;Try to relax, please,&gt; a very soft psionic voice whispered in her mind.
     Eh? Rune thought as her blood turned to ice.  Who&#39;s this?
     &lt;A&#39;del, ma&#39;am,&gt; the voice replied.  &lt;I&#39;m far more sensitive to empathic
disturbances than either General Al&#39;vexi or Captain Ael&#39;ien, so I tend to feel
it when a person is agitated for some reason.  I&#39;m not sure if you would care
to talk about what&#39;s on your mind, ma&#39;am, but I would appreciate it from a
psionic standpoint if you could try to relax.&gt;
     Find a way to kill Sailor Moon for me and I will be greatly relaxed, Rune
thought darkly on pure impulse.  She paused as she felt a wave of amusement
drift down from the web of psionic connections.
     &lt;No disrespect, ma&#39;am, but apparently it never occurred to you to send a
trained telepath after her,&gt; A&#39;del said with a faint tinkle of humor to her
quite telepathic voice.
     A dark wave of anger promptly flushed through Rune.  You assume I haven&#39;t,
she snarled.  One was indeed dispatched to Earth several months ago, and when
the Sailor Scouts were done with him his ashes fit rather nicely in a shoe box.
Also, surely you are quite aware of the fact that the Psi-Corp was thoroughly
decimated by them and that your former captain now guards her mind on Earth.
If you think you can deal with both Whisper and Sailor Moon, then by all means
let me know and I&#39;ll send you to Earth on a personal assignment.  Otherwise, I
strongly suggest you hold your tongue, Ensign, as your division simply doesn&#39;t
have the personnel to spare for such missions.
     &lt;Rune,&gt; Al&#39;vexi&#39;s voice suddenly came through the mesh.  &lt;Is something
wrong?  I can feel your blood pressure starting to spike from here.&gt;
     &lt;Just thinking of our dear friend Sailor Moon,&gt; Rune grumbled, deciding
that it wasn&#39;t worth the effort of publicly crucifying A&#39;del for her comments.
     &lt;The Moon Princess?&gt; Vol said carefully.
     &lt;Now is not the time to discuss this,&gt; Al&#39;vexi said firmly.
     &lt;But after the radioactive threat is negated, yes?&gt; the monk persisted.
&lt;Forgive me, but I find this to be a most pressing subject of importance and I
doubt I am alone in this opinion.&gt;
     Rune felt her insides turn to lead at the thought of having to hold any
sort of public discussion on the issue.  Anyone in the military could be given
a direct order not to discuss the matter further, with suitable examples being
made out of the first violators, but she simply didn&#39;t have the authority to
impose such a restriction on a civilian.  At least, not legally....
     &lt;If such a wild theory can be proven,&gt; Al&#39;vexi replied.  &lt;We have had how
many cross-species successes in our recorded history?  A history that spans how
many tens of thousands of years?  And you wish the world to believe that all of
a sudden we have a hybrid girl running around on Earth?  Not just any child, of
course, but the daughter of a very prominent denizen who died thousands of
years ago?  I am not calling Master Healer Maq&#39;i&#39;s sanity into question at this
point, but I am certainly not going to get flustered by a story she was told by
her kidnappers.&gt;
     &lt;Ma&#39;am?&gt; Ael&#39;ien spoke up in a very hesitant voice.  &lt;You.... might be
getting your wish.  It seems that the Dragoon Legion has made contact with the
Sailor Scouts and are trying to set up a meeting where they will run a genetic
analysis of Sailor Moon&#39;s blood and DNA.  If she is half-denizen, that will be
pretty obvious in the first three seconds of such a scan.  The paternity claim
will probably only take an additional ten or twenty seconds to sort out, as
they also have the genetic records of the suspected father as well.&gt;
     &lt;*WHAT?*&gt;
     &lt;Ow, ow, not so loud, please!&gt;
     &lt;Hey, careful!  We&#39;re losing the mesh!  Everyone, please focus!&gt;
     [...?]
     &lt;Everyone, just settle down.  Tempest, mind the pressure in the cyclone,
it&#39;s starting to drop again.  If it gets too low the Castle will start to have
decompression effects and that will not help our situation one bit.&gt;
     &lt;Especially if we&#39;re still out on the balcony here....&gt;
     &lt;Precisely.  Everyone, your focus would be appreciated.  I should like to
remind you that I and the other flag officers are aware of your concerns about
the Moon Princess and the suggestions of her heritage, and that we will be
monitoring things very closely.  It is not to anyone&#39;s benefit, however, to let
abstract thoughts and baseless speculations get in the way of our work or to
distract us from our duties.  Pa&#39;an Vol, I realize that you are not obligated
to the military in any fashion, but I do ask that you respect our wishes for
this to remain outside of the general public domain until all the facts have
been gathered and verified.  While the throne itself currently sits empty, you
may rest assured that we who serve the NegaForce are still diligently working
on behalf of both it and the greater good of the planet as a whole.&gt;
     &lt;Understood, General,&gt; Vol said simply.
     [...?]
     &lt;Ma&#39;am?  I think it wants something....&gt; A&#39;del spoke up.
     &lt;Lieutenant Tempest?&gt;
     &lt;I&#39;m trying to stabilize the pressure, but the overmind isn&#39;t listening.&gt;
     &lt;Enough, everyone,&gt; Si&#39;ren spoke up quietly.  &lt;Al, worry about getting it
back under control before it hurts us.  Everyone else, focus on your powers.
Whatever the truth is about Sailor Moon, it can wait.  The radiation can&#39;t.&gt;
     &lt;Understood, Admiral.&gt;
     &lt;Copy, ma&#39;am.&gt;
     &lt;Rune?&gt; Al&#39;vexi telepathed privately.  &lt;Just let it go.  Once we&#39;re done
here, your role in things is over.  And you know what?  That&#39;s actually the
best thing for you right now.&gt;
     Oh, really? Rune thought back in a scathing tone.  How so?
     &lt;Consider this.... you are still relieved of command, which places the
onus on Si&#39;ren.  If the Dragoons do go forward with this and air their findings
to the general public, the fallout will fall on Si&#39;ren as she will be the one
blamed for allowing military intelligence to publish this as it happened while
on her watch.  Granted I will probably suffer some of the backlash for my role
in things, but you should be able to pick up the pieces.&gt;
     The thought was enough to stun Rune into silence for several moments.  Al?
she finally replied.  Why?  Why would you do this?
     &lt;I was not simply tossing feel-good words around when I spoke of doing
what is best for the NegaForce and the population as a whole,&gt; the telepath
replied softly.  &lt;We all have our strengths and weaknesses.  I truly believe
that Si&#39;ren can navigate us through this difficult time with Nop&#39;tera and maybe
even the situation with the Moon Princess, which is why I support her efforts
as they stand.  Should she fail, however, we will be in an entirely different
situation, one that I suspect we will fare better in if you were still able to
exert an influence.&gt;
     As immersed in the mesh as they all were, Rune was pretty sure that she
wouldn&#39;t have been able to feel it if her jaw fell into her lap.  The icy shock
of realization, however, was just as mental as it was physical and thus was
quite easily felt as it rampaged through her.  You too, Al&#39;vexi?  First Jedyt
plays me for the fool, and now you try to manipulate me like a pawn?
     A soft sigh echoed down the mental link.  &lt;If you truly believe that, then
perhaps it would be best for you to simply kill me where I sit once we are done
with the overmind mesh.  I&#39;m sure you can explain it away to the others.  Has
it always been this way with you, that one is either your unquestioning minion
or is seeking to undermine you behind your back?  Must it always be political?
I have a conscience, Rune, I have to be able to wake up each day and look at my
reflection in the mirror without hating what I see.  What I am doing now is
what I have always done during the course of my life, what I truly feel is the
best thing for this world and its people.  If you do not agree with me, so be
it, I can handle constructive dissent.  It is when I am faced with destructive
and baseless paranoia that things become exceedingly difficult for everyone.&gt;
     Al? Rune thought as a wave of weariness washed over her, making her feel
tired in ways she had rarely felt before.  Kill the Moon Princess, and most of
our problems simply vanish.  Is that really asking too much?
     &lt;It is, I admit, a simple solution,&gt; Al&#39;vexi replied quietly.  &lt;Could it
be done with a minimum of complications?  Perhaps.  But is it the best way to
solve these problems?  That is where we disagree, and it is towards the best
possible solution that both honor and duty demands I strive for.  Do not try
to confuse my sense of honor with an institutional cultivation like what the
Dragoon Legion has, they do not compare.  Their way is learned by training and
devotion, a powerful culture that is imprinted on them.  My honor, however, is
what I already said it was.... what I feel I need to do in order to look at my
reflection in the morning and still tolerate what I find.&gt;
     So that&#39;s it, then? Rune found herself thinking with open resignation.
I&#39;m just supposed to stand aside and let our worst enemy accede to the throne?
Surrender control of the military to either a sea-based admiral or a vampiric
general who hasn&#39;t set foot in this world in a thousand years?  Is that really
what is best for this world?
     &lt;If Sailor Moon is our best hope, is she truly our enemy?&gt; Al&#39;vexi replied
gently.  &lt;If Si&#39;ren assumes command, do you think others were let her run it
aground?  Or Nop&#39;tera, for that matter?  We are all cogs in a greater machine,
Rune, we can only influence so much around us.  But if the choice is either to
continue running a damaged machine or see it destroyed outright by sabotage....
I think I would prefer to see it limp along and try to find a way to repair it
rather than have it destroyed and lose everything.  That is what I believe we
are now facing in these times, my friend, either the utter destruction or the
salvation of the Negaverse.  I have chosen my side, which happens to be one of
many factions working towards the goal of saving this world and admittedly does
not mesh well with several of the other factions.  The question is, Rune, which
side are you on?  You have to look inward to find the answer, and it is not an
answer I can provide for you.  Just a simple question, Rune, and you only have
to answer yourself if nobody else.  Which side are you on?&gt;
     The question echoed in Rune&#39;s mind long after the voice fell silent, the
soft words seeming to blend together with the repeated thoughts and concerns
about the Moon Princess.  She&#39;s using me, she thought to herself.  Not just
Al&#39;vexi, but Sailor Moon as well.  They&#39;re both using me for a purpose.... but
can Al&#39;vexi be right?  Can it really be for the greater good?
     &lt;General Rune?&gt; A&#39;del whispered softly.
     &lt;Leave her alone, she has a lot on her mind,&gt; Al&#39;vexi replied.
     &lt;Don&#39;t we all....&gt;
     &lt;As you were, Ensign.&gt;
     &lt;Yes, ma&#39;am.  I think we&#39;ve got the overmind back in its playpen.&gt;
     &lt;I do hope so, for I think we would all find it to be most uncomfortable
if the pressure were to drop any further than what it already has.&gt;
     &lt;No argument there, ma&#39;am.  Umm....&gt;
     &lt;Yes?&gt;
     &lt;Are you sure she&#39;s alright?  I can feel her mood from here, and it&#39;s....
well, a little disconcerting.  I mean, I know you flags almost always have some
sort of weight on your shoulders and often a sharp stick being jabbed in your
ptanka by someone else, but....&gt;
     &lt;As I said, Ensign, she has a lot on her mind and it is best if you left
her alone,&gt; Al&#39;vexi said calmly.  &lt;Do not worry, as worrying is my job.&gt;
     &lt;Copy, General,&gt; A&#39;del replied with an audible smirk.
     [...?  ...!  ....  ....]
     &lt;Wow, the overmind got real excited all of a sudden.  Should I ask why?&gt;
     &lt;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, let go!  Turn it off, turn it off!&gt;
     &lt;Oh, k&#39;ves, what is it playing with now?&gt;
     &lt;You&#39;re going to love this one.&gt;
     &lt;Let&#39;s hear it.&gt;
     &lt;It discovered how it can use my weather-control powers to manipulate the
ambient temperature of the clouds and hence the precipitation inside.&gt;
     &lt;Why does that sound bad?&gt;
     &lt;Hey, is it just me or is it getting a little cold in here?&gt;
     &lt;Umm, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just you, Sergeant.&gt;
     &lt;Great.  Just what we need, frostbite.  Charming.&gt;
     &lt;Wait, you&#39;re kidding right?&gt;
     &lt;It&#39;s.... turning to ice....&gt;
     &lt;And me without my thermal underwear.  C&#39;mon, Junior, turn it off!  Will
one of you telepaths help me here?&gt;
     &lt;Let&#39;s hope it learns real quick what cold air does to rain and decides
that it&#39;s not the effect it really wants, eh?&gt;
     &lt;Care to explain to us just how bad the situation is right now?&gt;
     &lt;I hope someone&#39;s getting satellite overheads of this one.  I&#39;ve always
wanted to see what the Imperial Castle looked like under a foot of snow....&gt;
     
                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Serena,&quot; Ami sighed heavily as she watched the blonde cram fully half of
her sandwich in her mouth, &quot;You don&#39;t need to shovel it all in at once.&quot;
     &quot;But &#39;m hungwy,&quot; Serena replied as she chewed.
     &quot;You&#39;re always hungry,&quot; Leda observed dryly as she leaned back against the
oak tree and nibbled on her own lunch.  &quot;But still, Ami&#39;s got a point.  Slow
down before it ends up going down the wrong pipe, okay?&quot;
     Ami glanced around the schoolyard as Serena made a soft grumbling noise to
herself and continued demolishing her lunch.  She could see Mina off in the
distance holding a rather animated conversation with the new student, Lily,
which didn&#39;t surprise her in the slightest given the blonde&#39;s highly sociable
tendencies.  She couldn&#39;t spot Rei yet, which made her just a little uneasy as
the priestess was usually one of the first ones in the courtyard once the lunch
bell sounded.
     &quot;So you doing alright, Serena?&quot; Leda inquired casually.  &quot;Heard you&#39;ve
been a little tense all day, which really isn&#39;t like you.  I mean, I know it&#39;s
Monday and all and we&#39;ve come to expect you to be a gloomy Gus, but still....&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not that bad,&quot; Serena muttered as she started in on a dark red apple.
     &quot;But...?&quot; Leda prompted carefully.
     Serena paused in mid-chomp and glanced over at Ami just as the blue-haired
girl looked over at her.  She sighed and removed the apple from her mouth, idly
studying the teeth marks left on the surface.  &quot;I&#39;m just a little.... worried,
I guess,&quot; she admitted in a very quiet tone.
     &quot;About what, Serena?&quot; Ami inquired cautiously.
     &quot;About.... you know,&quot; the blonde hesitated.  &quot;The angel thing.&quot;
     Leda chuckled wickedly to herself.  &quot;Trust me, meatball head, nobody here
at school who knows about your blonde tendencies and mischievous side is going
to think you&#39;re even remotely angelic,&quot; she teased.
     &quot;Leda!&quot; Ami said sharply.
     &quot;Lily did,&quot; Serena said quietly as she looked up at the brunette.
     &quot;So what?&quot; Leda replied with a shrug of dismissal.  &quot;Like I just said ten
seconds ago, nobody who KNOWS you will say that.  She just met you, of course
she&#39;s going to give you the benefit of the doubt.  You are a nice person deep
inside, after all, fights with Rei notwithstanding....&quot;
     &quot;Leda,&quot; Ami sighed heavily.
     &quot;....And admit it, you&#39;re not exactly hard on the eyes either,&quot; Leda went
on, ignoring Ami&#39;s exasperated sigh and causing Serena to blush.  &quot;So you just
might look like an angel to her.... until you pull some crazy stunt like what
Mina routinely does for giggles when she&#39;s bored....&quot;
     &quot;Leda, it&#39;s not just Lily,&quot; Serena blurted out.  &quot;I&#39;ve had several people
I only know in passing come up to me and ask me what I did to make myself....
so radiant, is what they most often said.&quot;
     &quot;Huh?&quot; Leda said, almost choking on a portion of her fruit cup.
     &quot;I don&#39;t think I look different today than I did on Friday,&quot; Serena said
in a low tone as she glanced around nervously.  &quot;But I think something *has*
changed that other people can see, or at least pick up on.  So far they just
think that it&#39;s a new shampoo or that I&#39;m just in a good mood for a Monday, but
I&#39;m worried I&#39;m missing something!  I mean, I know my nails look different,&quot;
she said as she held out her hands with her fingers spread wide.  &quot;I&#39;m not all
that worried about it since I can say that&#39;s just some new clear polish.  But
what if there is something else?&quot;
     &quot;And if there is?&quot; Rei said quietly as she sat down next to Ami.  She had
approached in such perfect silence that it caught everyone off-guard, resulting
in squeals of surprise from not just Serena but Ami as well.
     &quot;Damn, Rei!&quot; Leda rasped as she thumped her chest hard, trying to convince
the mouthful of fruit that she had just swallowed to stay in the proper pipe.
&quot;Your grandfather teaching you how to do the ninja thing again or what?&quot;
     &quot;Again?&quot; Rei echoed, giving the brunette a slightly confused look.
     &quot;Remember way back when I walked into the temple as he was trying to teach
you and Chad something involving those boku-tohs?&quot; Leda prodded carefully.
     &quot;Oh, that,&quot; the priestess replied with a dismissive gesture.  &quot;Just a way
of using a weapon as a spiritual focus, that&#39;s all.  You need to calm down,&quot;
she added, giving Ami a mild look.  &quot;I think you yelped louder than Serena did,
and that&#39;s saying something.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, leave me alone,&quot; Serena grumbled.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami apologized with a dark blush as she looked away.  &quot;I was just
a little distracted and wasn&#39;t paying attention, that&#39;s all.&quot;
     Leda snorted quietly and buried her face in her fruit cup.  &quot;Like that&#39;s
anything new around here,&quot; she muttered under her breath.
     Ami watched Mina and Lily talking in the distance before she felt the hair
on the back of her neck stand up, turning around to find Rei staring at her
with a perfectly unreadable mask of concealed emotions.  &quot;Something wrong?&quot; she
ventured in an uncertain tone.
     &quot;Funny you should mention feeling distracted,&quot; Rei replied in a tone that
was completely devoid of any emotion.  &quot;You aren&#39;t by chance getting a feeling
of unease every so often, are you?  Like something&#39;s here that you can&#39;t quite
put your finger on?&quot;
     &quot;Umm, guys?&quot; Leda said slowly as she saw Ami&#39;s expression abruptly change.
&quot;Is there something going on that we need to know about?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m trying to find out if there is,&quot; Rei replied without taking her eyes
off Ami.  &quot;You&#39;ve been feeling it too, haven&#39;t you?&quot; she prodded carefully.
     &quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Ami admitted quietly.  &quot;My vampiric side seems to be a bit
unsettled today, if that&#39;s what you mean, but that could be caused by several
things.  It could be reacting to Serena, for all I know.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, why are you looking at me like that?&quot; Serena protested as Rei&#39;s
bottomless black eyes turned to focus on her.
     &quot;Probably because she&#39;s likely right?&quot; Rei said in a flat tone.  She then
sighed heavily and rubbed her face, her whole body suddenly seeming to be
overcome with weariness.  &quot;Damn it, Serena,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;I know it&#39;s not
your fault, but can&#39;t you do something about your emotions or something?  I&#39;m
starting to think they&#39;re leaking somehow and that Ami and I are picking up on
it subconsciously or something.  You have been uneasy all day, right?&quot; she
prodded carefully.
     &quot;Umm.... well, yeah....&quot; Serena replied slowly.
     &quot;Typical,&quot; the priestess muttered as she glanced off towards the horizon.
     &quot;Wait, whoa, hey, back up,&quot; Leda protested as she rubbed her temples in an
attempt at enticing her sudden headache to go away.  &quot;You mean that because
Serena&#39;s been on pins and needles all morning that you and Ami have been able
to feel it too or something?  When the hell did this start happening?&quot;
     &quot;When did she become an angel again?&quot; Rei pointed out quietly.
     &quot;Rei, we don&#39;t know if that really is the cause,&quot; Ami spoke up.
     Rei shrugged to herself.  &quot;Fine, let me know when you have a better idea,&quot;
she replied as she stood back up.  &quot;If I&#39;m picking up on her mood leaks, that
would explain a few of the emotional issues I&#39;ve been having lately.  See if I
bring you back from the dead again,&quot; she muttered as she walked off.
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Leda called out after her.  &quot;Yo, Rei!  Get back here!  Rei!&quot;
     Ami sighed as she reached out to put a hand on Serena&#39;s suddenly trembling
arm.  &quot;Serena, please, just take it easy,&quot; she said gently.  &quot;We don&#39;t even
know what the problem is here, okay?  It could just be a coincidence of some
sort.  I really don&#39;t see how your emotions could be affecting her.&quot;
     &quot;But.... but what if they can?&quot; Serena whimpered quietly, her blue eyes
starting to fill with tears.  &quot;What if that is part of my denizen side, that I
will always.... leak emotions?&quot;
     &quot;Please,&quot; Leda chuckled.  &quot;C&#39;mon, Serena, you&#39;ve always worn your heart on
your sleeve, how could you possibly call that a leak?  Rei sure knows how to
pick a stupid term for something, too,&quot; she added ruefully.  &quot;Leaking emotions,
please.  If duct-tape could have helped, we&#39;d have tried that months ago....&quot;
     &quot;Leda....&quot; Ami sighed heavily.
     &quot;Hey, Serena&#39;s smiling about it,&quot; Leda pointed out with a grin.
     &quot;It is kinda silly when you put it like that,&quot; Serena admitted quietly.
     &quot;Never hurts to laugh, Serena,&quot; the brunette added with a gentle pat on
the blonde&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Well, at least not gently.  Lord knows I&#39;ve had my
fair share of stomach cramps from laughing too hard, but that&#39;s not the point.
In any case, I think I just found a sizable hole in Rei&#39;s leakage theory.  Stop
and think, if it&#39;s something that has to do with your angelic nature and that
both Rei&#39;s spiritual senses and Ami&#39;s vampiric nature can pick up on it, then
what about Susan?  Surely she would be picking up on it as well, right?&quot;
     There was a very noticeable pause as Serena and Ami blinked and looked at
one another, both clearly mulling over Leda&#39;s words.  &quot;That would make sense,&quot;
Ami ventured carefully as she turned back to the brunette.  &quot;Especially when
you take her demonic side&#39;s sensitivity to spiritual energies into account.&quot;
     &quot;See?&quot; Leda said as she relaxed and leaned back against the tree.  &quot;You
guys worry too much sometimes.  It&#39;s Monday, okay?  That tends to put everybody
in a disgruntled mood and.... topic shift, incoming,&quot; she suddenly warned as
she sat back up.
     Ami blinked and cast a quick glance over her shoulder, feeling a slight
sense of unease forming in her abdomen as she saw Mina approaching the group
with Lily in tow.  She wasn&#39;t sure what to make of the new student yet, save
that she seemed to be fairly intelligent judging by some of her comments made
during a discussion about a question in their science class.  However, there
was still a vague feeling of uncertainty about the pale-haired girl that she
couldn&#39;t put her finger on.
     &quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Mina said cheerfully as they approached.  &quot;Good morning,
fellow space cadets, how&#39;s life?&quot;
     &quot;Just fine until ten seconds ago,&quot; Leda replied dryly.
     &quot;Ignore the big meanie,&quot; Mina said to Lily with a lopsided smirk.  &quot;She&#39;s
a bit of a fruitcake, but she&#39;s still a good person.  Umm, speaking of fruit,&quot;
she added slowly as she sniffed at the air, &quot;Do I smell pineapple?&quot;
     &quot;Sure do,&quot; Leda replied as she made a gesture with her empty fruit cup.
&quot;And it was delicious.&quot;
     &quot;You are so cruel sometimes,&quot; Mina whimpered as she eyed the empty cup.
She blinked as Leda reached into her backpack and pulled out another small cup
of mixed fruit.  The cup was casually launched through the air on a shallow arc
to land perfectly in Mina&#39;s hands.  &quot;Oooh, thank you!&quot;
     &quot;And she calls me a fruitcake,&quot; the brunette chuckled as she watched Mina
use her fingernails to neatly slice a perfect circle out of the foil cover.
&quot;Have a seat, Lily, we&#39;re not going anywhere anytime soon.  You&#39;ve already met
Ami and Serena, right?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, I have,&quot; Lily replied quietly as she gave Serena a warm smile.  &quot;My
savior in math class.  Thank you again for helping me out.  Goodness, are you
alright, Mina?&quot; she added in a worried tone as Mina half-choked on part of her
diced pineapple.
     &quot;Sure, sure, fine,&quot; Mina coughed as she waved a hand around.  She finally
cleared her throat and gave the pale-haired girl a startled look, her cheeks
flushed a moderate shade of red.  &quot;It&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never heard anyone ever
refer to Serena as a savior in class before.  Especially in a math class....&quot;
     &quot;I just helped her find the right page, that&#39;s all,&quot; Serena spoke up, her
own cheeks taking on a light pink tint.
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Leda chuckled as she put her arms behind her head and leaned back
against the tree.  &quot;Looks like there&#39;s hope for you after all, eh, Serena?&quot; she
teased, chuckling again as Serena made a sour face at her.
     &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; the long-haired blonde grumbled.
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Lily asked hesitantly as she carefully studied the other girl.
     &quot;Yes?&quot; Ami replied cautiously as she glanced up from her textbook.
     &quot;May I ask you a personal question, please?&quot; Lily said, giving Ami a very
cautious yet hopeful look.  She waited until she got a nod in reply before she
continued, &quot;I have never seen someone with hair colored like yours before, or
at least not as successfully with artificial dye, yet I have heard that some
people do have hair that color.  I mean no offense, but I cannot tell which it
is at the moment....&quot; she said, her cheeks turning a vibrant pink color.
     &quot;It&#39;s natural,&quot; Ami replied, feeling a wave of heat rise to her face.
     &quot;But forgive me, I did not mean to embarrass you!&quot; Lily protested as she
noticed the sharp contrast of color to Ami&#39;s rapidly-changing complexion.
     &quot;Ah, relax,&quot; Leda spoke up with a faint smile.  &quot;We all think Ami looks
pretty cute when she blushes like that.&quot;
     Mina just sighed and shook her head ruefully as she finished picking out
the last chunks of pineapple from the fruit cup.  &quot;See, I told you she can be
a mean one,&quot; she said to Lily.
     Ami cast an unamused glare at Leda before turning back to Lily.  &quot;It runs
in the family,&quot; she explained calmly.  &quot;My mother has the same shade of blue
hair as well.  It&#39;s not very common at all, granted, but I&#39;m a little surprised
that you&#39;ve never seen it before.&quot;
     A faint smile of embarrassment crossed Lily&#39;s face as she tinted pink once
again.  &quot;My homeland is not the most diverse of countries,&quot; she admitted with
a faint hint of apology to her musical voice.  &quot;I have only twice before met
people who claimed their exotic hair-coloring was natural.  Everyone else I&#39;ve
met said they had used varying dyes for effect.  I have seen blue-dyed hair,
but as I said, it was never as richly colorful as your hair is.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami said after a slight hesitation, not precisely sure how to
field the other girl&#39;s statement.
     Lily gave her a warm smile and giggled very quietly.  &quot;At least your hair
has color to it,&quot; she pointed out as she picked up one of her braids.  She very
carefully rolled the ends between her fingertips and fanned it out so that the
individual strands were clearly visible.  &quot;My hair is almost transparent, like
a spider&#39;s silk.  I am one of the few people who can actually gain color from
using bleach, as it leaves the strands milky white.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s still pretty,&quot; Serena spoke up as she carefully reached out to
touch the lock of hair.  &quot;Ohhh, and it&#39;s nice and silky too!  Real soft.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Lily replied as she gave Serena a gentle smile.
     &quot;I keep trying to get her to tell me how she does it,&quot; Mina interjected
with a faint note of envy and jealousy.  &quot;You know, shampoo or conditioner and
the like, but I keep getting this line about natural beauty.&quot;
     &quot;But it is,&quot; Lily protested with a smile.  &quot;I cannot help it if my hair
grows soft and colorless on its own.&quot;
     A dour sigh rose up from Leda&#39;s chest.  &quot;Color might have something to do
with it, too,&quot; she grumbled as she reached up to toy with a streamer of her own
medium-brown hair.  &quot;I can get the soft thing going if I shampoo and condition
it until my head hurts, but it gets all coarse and wiry on me a few hours after
it dries.  My only consolation is that at least it grows straight and can be
brushed out with a minimum of tangles.&quot;
     &quot;Snarl in your hair, dearie?&quot; Mina purred in a wicked tone.  &quot;That might
explain the snarl in your attitude most mornings....&quot;
     &quot;Okay, where&#39;s a stick?&quot; Leda sighed as she made a show of looking around
the area.  &quot;Hang on, Blondie, I&#39;ll have a snarl for you to play with, just as
soon as I can find something solid to beat your....&quot;
     &quot;Leda,&quot; Ami sighed quietly, giving the brunette a reproving look.
     &quot;You should see her when she really gets going,&quot; Mina said to Lily with a
truly evil grin.  &quot;They don&#39;t call her the Psycho-Killer for nothing.&quot;
     &quot;Goodness,&quot; Lily observed carefully.  &quot;That does not sound good....&quot;
     A faint smirk crossed Leda&#39;s face as she closed her eyes and relaxed back
against the oak tree once again.  &quot;It&#39;s real simple, kid,&quot; she drawled.  &quot;Don&#39;t
mess with me and I won&#39;t have a reason to mess with you.  Sorry if I don&#39;t deal
with stupid people very well, like idiots who want to try to throw their weight
around because they think they&#39;ve got some muscle and a few half-baked ideas
about how to fight.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, something like that,&quot; Mina said absently as she leaned back several
degrees to study something in the distance, a small frown forming on her face.
&quot;Speaking of half-baked idiots, tell me that isn&#39;t someone harassing Willow
again....&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Serena said as she turned around, her eyes going wide.
     A truly dark sigh rose up from Leda&#39;s chest as she sat up straight and got
to her feet.  &quot;So much for starting the week off on a quiet note,&quot; she grumbled
as she cracked her knuckles.  &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;
     &quot;Leda, don&#39;t start another fist-fight,&quot; Ami sighed in resignation.
     &quot;What, you want to handle this one?&quot; Leda offered, making a gesture for
her to proceed ahead of her.
     &quot;Tell you what,&quot; Mina said as she gracefully slipped between Leda and Ami
to move past them.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you let me try the diplomatic approach first,
and if that doesn&#39;t work then you can pound the goofball into the ground.  That
sound fair to you?&quot; she inquired as she lobbed the half-eaten fruit cup into a
nearby trash can.
     &quot;Deal,&quot; the brunette said as she glared at the figures in the distance.
&quot;Excuse us,&quot; she added absently to Lily as she started to follow the blonde
across the courtyard.  It didn&#39;t take them very long to cover the distance at
all, a clear path opening up as if by magic once the other students realized
that Leda looked to be on the warpath again.
     &quot;Hey, hey, hey, what seems to be the problem here?&quot; Mina said in a mildly
affable tone as she very skillfully edged in between Willow and her adversary.
     &quot;Beat it, sister,&quot; the stocky dishwater-blonde growled in reply.  A very
light splattering of pale red could be seen on one sleeve, as if a few drops of
something had been spilled on it.  &quot;This is between me and the whale here.&quot;
     &quot;Hey, it was a simple accident!&quot; Willow protested, her cheeks becoming
flushed at the snide comment about her plump figure.  &quot;And you&#39;re the one who
waved your arms around without looking, so don&#39;t blame me.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, come on, ladies, there&#39;s no need for such anger,&quot; Mina cooed as she
made a settle-down gesture.  &quot;Surely a little accident isn&#39;t worth getting all
riled up over, right?  I mean, we&#39;ve all had those little oopsies before....&quot;
     Amanda Parkins paused and cast a dangerous glare over at Mina.  &quot;You&#39;re
about to encounter an &#39;oopsie&#39; if you don&#39;t mind your own business, you little
uptight busybody,&quot; she growled.  &quot;Now scram.&quot;
     Mina paused and raised an eyebrow, giving the other girl a cool look in
response.  &quot;Aww, ain&#39;t that sweet, the mouth wants a piece of me.  Oh, well, so
much for the diplomatic approach,&quot; she said as she sighed theatrically.  &quot;Tag,
Leda, you&#39;re it.&quot;
     Both Mina and Willow found it absolutely amazing at how fast the color
drained from Amanda&#39;s face.  &quot;What...?&quot; she said before her eyes tripled in
diameter as she felt a hand clamp down on her shoulder.
     &quot;You know, Amanda,&quot; Leda said in a languid voice that was almost literally
dripping with scorn, &quot;I&#39;ll give you credit for being a persistent little tart.
I mean, who else would be dumb enough to keep harassing friends of mine after
being warned the first time?&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;ve got to be kidding me,&quot; Amanda said in a faintly shaky tone.  &quot;As
long as I&#39;ve known you?  You&#39;re not friends with the Goodyear blimp here, she&#39;s
simply not your type.&quot;
     Mina reached out to snag Willow&#39;s arm, pulling her to the side with casual
grace as Leda shoved the stocky blonde forward to encounter the brick siding of
the school.  &quot;Temper, temper,&quot; Mina said absently with a yawn.
     &quot;Okay, reject, listen carefully,&quot; Leda snarled as she spun Amanda around
so that they faced one another.  &quot;Am I good friends with Willow?  Not really,
but then again, I don&#39;t need to be best-buddies with everyone to be on good
terms with them.  She is, however, a good friend of both Mina and Serena, both
of whom are *my* best friends.  Now then, are you starting to get the picture
here, or shall I spell it out for you in excruciating detail?&quot; she added with
an ominous flexing of her wrist, placing careful emphasis on her usage of the
word &#39;excruciating&#39;.
     Both Leda and Amanda blinked as Mina eased her hand between them and very
gently pressed against the upper part of Leda&#39;s large chest.  &quot;Easy, tiger,&quot;
she purred softly.  &quot;I think that we can try the diplomatic approach again, now
that we have her attention.  You are listening this time, I trust?&quot; she added
lightly as she cast an overly cheerful smile at Amanda.
     &quot;Yeah, what?&quot; Amanda ventured in a very leery tone, not entirely sure if
there was any significance of the way Mina&#39;s hand was pressed against Leda&#39;s
chest without actually seeming to be touching her breasts.
     Mina smirked and removed her hand from Leda&#39;s blouse, clasping it behind
her.  &quot;Oh, it&#39;s simple, really.  Just walk away and forget the whole mess ever
happened.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll come out in the wash without worries,&quot; she added
with a casual jerk of her chin towards the spotted sleeve.  &quot;Willow isn&#39;t too
keen on confrontations either, so I know she&#39;s not going to go out of her way
to make an issue of this or otherwise bother to remember anything.  Like I said
earlier, accidents do happen and we&#39;ve all had them before, so it&#39;s really not
a big deal or anything.  I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll even ignore the insults, since she&#39;s
a nice person at heart.&quot;
     &quot;Right....&quot; Amanda said dryly.  She blinked as Leda leaned over so that
their noses were only inches apart.  &quot;Now what?&quot; she muttered.
     &quot;Sounds like a plan to me,&quot; Leda said quietly.  &quot;I&#39;ll even let you walk
away without tossing you around like a wet sock in the dryer, providing you
don&#39;t give me the slightest excuse to change my mind.  Of course, that means
you don&#39;t harass any of my friends again, but surely that should have sunk in
during the little get-togethers we used to have back at our old school....&quot;
     A soft snarl rose up from Amanda&#39;s throat.  &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re not into
whips and chains?&quot; she inquired in a very careful tone.  &quot;That would explain an
awful lot about your aggressive streak....&quot;
     Mina just rolled her eyes as she reached up to grab Leda&#39;s wrist in fluid
motion just as it was drawn back.  &quot;Oh, come on, that one was so weak it wasn&#39;t
even worthy of an eyeroll,&quot; she chided the brunette.  &quot;Look, if she wants the
S&amp;M treatment, we can introduce her to Susan later.  No, better yet, Megan,&quot;
she said with a faint hint of glee to her tone as she narrowed her eyes.  The
change in her mood was enough to cause everyone else to blink hard and exchange
looks of unease.
     &quot;Uh, did I miss something here?&quot; Leda said warily, her eyebrows arched up
to her hairline.
     &quot;Nah, I was just thinking that Megan would probably be more than happy to
chain our little problem-child here to the wall,&quot; Mina replied with an idle
gesture to Amanda.  &quot;She just comes across as that kind of woman, you know?  I
mean, who else would bother using a live bat as a hair ornament?&quot;
     &quot;Yeah....&quot; Amanda said very slowly as she discreetly began to edge away
from both Leda and Mina.  &quot;Tell you what, you girls go talk about whom you&#39;re
going to play with after school and all, and I&#39;ll just go take a raincheck for
later or something, okay?&quot;
     &quot;Hold still, dirtball, we&#39;re not done with you yet,&quot; Leda sighed.
     &quot;Just let her go, girl,&quot; Mina sighed theatrically as she craned her neck
to look up at the clouds.  &quot;I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll forget about this little accident
of no importance before school lets out for the day.  In fact, I&#39;m pretty sure
we all will forget about this whole incident.&quot;
     &quot;I hope I can,&quot; Leda muttered softly as she glanced at Willow.  The chubby
girl gave her a sour nod of agreement, obviously wishing that she could erase
the visual from her mind that Mina had painted a few moments ago.
     &quot;See?&quot; Mina said cheerfully, clapping her hands as she briefly bounced on
her toes.  &quot;Diplomacy can solve problems after all.  Okay, off with you now,&quot;
she said as she made a shooing motion at Amanda.  She paused in mid-motion as
she noticed the crowd that had gathered around them, obviously to watch what
sort of violence Leda was going to unleash this time.  &quot;Show&#39;s over, guys,&quot; she
called out as she made a shooing motion at the crowd as well.  &quot;Nothing to see
here anymore, honest.  Seriously, go away....&quot;
     &quot;Someone got something they want to say?&quot; Leda said loudly, taking her
time in turning around to look behind her.  To nobody&#39;s surprise, Amanda took
the opportunity to make a very quiet and unobtrusive exit, vanishing around a
corner a few seconds later.
     &quot;Damn,&quot; Mina said very quietly as she watched the way the crowd abruptly
dispersed.  &quot;I wish I could do that.  Usually I have to spend a few minutes
quietly working the area before I can create a bubble of privacy like this.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s all in the reputation, girl,&quot; Leda said absently as she glanced over
at Willow.  &quot;So you can take it from here, right?&quot;
     &quot;Uh.... I guess so,&quot; Willow replied in an uncertain tone.  &quot;Not that I
know what I&#39;m supposed to be taking where or anything, but.... oh, hi, Serena,&quot;
she called out as she saw the group approach them.
     &quot;Hi,&quot; Serena replied quietly as she drew close enough for conversation.
Ami and Lily were right behind her, the former giving the brunette a look of
resignation while the latter was clearly unsettled by what she had both seen
and heard.
     &quot;Hey,&quot; Leda said absently by way of greeting.
     &quot;Umm, Leda?  Was that.... really necessary?&quot; Serena ventured carefully,
trying to gauge what sort of mood the other girl was in at the moment.
     Leda paused and gave her an odd look.  &quot;Necessary?  No, I could have let
her continue to torment Willow, if that&#39;s what you mean.  After our little
conversation, however, I doubt she&#39;ll try anything like that again.  Think of
it as a deterrent against future incidents.&quot;
     &quot;And how successful has that been in the past?&quot; Ami inquired in a faintly
edged tone.
     The brunette sighed and leaned her shoulder against the brick wall as she
crossed her arms over her ample chest.  &quot;Honestly?  I&#39;d say somewhere between
two-out-of-three and four-out-of-five times, it works.  Amanda&#39;s a bit of a
special case, however.  She used to go to my old school, you see, and we had a
bit of a rivalry going back then that tended to get.... what&#39;s a good word?&quot;
     &quot;Violently ugly?&quot; Mina suggested dryly.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just say that she usually found herself on the wrong end of the
beat-down stick a couple of times a month, if not more often,&quot; Leda replied
with a smug smile.
     &quot;Usually?&quot; Mina echoed carefully, her eyebrows arching up.
     There was a slight pause before the brunette made a face and grumbled
something inarticulate beneath her breath.  &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll be honest, she&#39;s
tossed a few good ones at me before and I&#39;ve had more than one school uniform
ruined because the bloodstains on the blouse wouldn&#39;t come out, but more often
than not I came out on top.  What can I say?&quot; she added with a shrug.  &quot;It&#39;s
not like I ever claimed to have a perfect record or anything, you know?&quot;
     &quot;Boy, I hope Melvin isn&#39;t around,&quot; Mina said quietly as she glanced around
the area.  &quot;One word of that into his bat-ears and your reputation would be so
ruined.&quot;
     &quot;Bah, like I care,&quot; Leda replied with another shrug.  &quot;Everyone already
knows what&#39;ll happen if you try to mess with me or my friends, so let him blab
about it.  Of course, he better get his facts straight if he does, or he&#39;ll be
discovering the flavor of the beat-down stick for himself....&quot;
     &quot;She&#39;s not usually like this,&quot; Ami said quietly to Lily with a soft sigh.
     &quot;Yes, she is,&quot; Serena muttered.
     Leda snorted quietly in contempt and pushed herself off the wall.  &quot;Thanks
a lot, guys, see if I go out of my way to help your friends again.  See you
after school,&quot; she growled as she moved past them and headed back over towards
the oak tree to retrieve her backpack.
     Mina blinked in surprise before sighing quietly to herself.  &quot;Okay, maybe
I need to go back to marking the calendar with colored crayons again,&quot; she said
to herself before looking over at Ami and Lily.  &quot;Ami is right, Leda&#39;s edges
usually aren&#39;t this rough.  Still, it is Monday, after all, and I can imagine
that she might be a little extra-cranky because of it.  However, she might also
be entering the proverbial red-zone here....&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Mina,&quot; Ami said in a flat tone as her cheeks tinted pink.
     &quot;Hey, umm, I gotta go,&quot; Willow said quickly as she glanced down at her
wristwatch.  &quot;It&#39;s almost time for class and all.&quot;
     &quot;Aww, already?&quot; Serena whined softly, giving Willow a petulant look.
     &quot;Time and tide waits for no woman, you know,&quot; Mina pointed out with a soft
sigh of her own.  &quot;Come on, girls, time to pack it up and get ready to return
to the dullness of our formal education.  Don&#39;t look at me like that, Ami, it&#39;s
dull to the rest of us non-geniuses,&quot; she added sourly.
     Ami sighed darkly and returned her science textbook to her backpack.  &quot;See
you in gym class,&quot; she said briskly and headed off towards the main building.
     &quot;Wow,&quot; Mina sighed as she looked up at the clouds.  &quot;I&#39;m really failing
the charisma checks today, aren&#39;t I?  Bah, it&#39;s Monday, that&#39;s an automatic
penalty on the die roll anyway.&quot;
     Serena and Lily traded identical looks of confusion before Lily delicately
cleared her throat.  &quot;Mina, what.... are you referring to?&quot; she asked slowly.
     &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Mina replied with a dismissive wave of her
hand.  &quot;Come on, girls, time to saddle up.  Willow, you want to...?  Willow?&quot;
she said as she looked around.  &quot;Damn, that girl can move fast.  And quietly,
too, I didn&#39;t even hear her wander off.  Sneaky little bugger, isn&#39;t she?  I
bet if she could lose a few pounds so she wouldn&#39;t stand out at a distance, she
could probably be a good taffer....&quot;
     &quot;Serena?&quot; Lily said very softly as she unobtrusively leaned over.  &quot;Is
Mina okay?  She seems a little.... chaotic.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s Mina,&quot; Serena muttered back with a rueful shake of her head.  &quot;Stick
around long enough and you should get used to her.  Should,&quot; she added with a
very quiet sigh that drew a very uneasy look from the Canadian student.  &quot;And
yes, chaotic is how everyone else describes her, too.  Welcome to Crossroads,&quot;
she said with another rueful shake of her head as the five-minute bell sounded,
indicating that lunch was over and that class would soon begin again.

                *               *               *               *

     The bank executive glanced up from the stack of paperwork on his desk as
his secretary knocked on his door.  &quot;Ming?&quot; he said in a weary voice as he saw
the manila folders in her hand.  &quot;Tell me that&#39;s good news you&#39;re carrying.&quot;
     &quot;It might be,&quot; she replied as she entered the office and set them down in
front of him.  There were nine folders in total, each one marked with a hand-
written label that indicated they were prospective new accounts to be opened.
Ordinarily such paperwork wouldn&#39;t have come anywhere near his desk, as it was
a matter for the tellers and low-level managers to deal with.  That they were
now being brought to him indicated that there was something unusual enough to
the requests that they needed executive approval to continue.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; he said in a neutral tone as he set his current report aside to get
a better idea of what the problem was.  Five of the folders were not marked in
any unusual fashion, suggesting that they would be processed normally.  One of
them was marked with a yellow sticky-flag, a second with an orange flag, and
the remaining two were marked with red flags.
     &quot;These were all filed at the same time by the same individual,&quot; she said
in a quiet tone, tapping one of the unflagged folders.  &quot;We ran the names past
our databases and they returned flags on these four.  This one,&quot; she said as
she tapped the yellow-flagged one, &quot;Is a pre-existing account.  This one came
back as a relational account,&quot; she explained as she gestured to the file with
the orange flag.  &quot;And the other two said simply to see you personally.  Given
the nature of the instructions, I thought it best to bring the entire batch up
for you to review as necessary.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; the executive said again, his bushy eyebrows rising up in surprise.
He glanced down at the names on the two red-flagged folders and blinked hard.
The first he recognized right away, but the second name took a few seconds to
sink in.  &quot;Ah, yes, I remember now.  Yes, I will handle these myself.  Thank
you, Ming, I appreciate this.&quot;
     &quot;My pleasure, sir,&quot; the secretary said simply before she quietly left the
room.  She paused for a brief moment at the door before quietly closing it
behind her with a soft click.
     The bank manager scooped up the folders and leaned back in his chair,
studying the names intently before opening the files one by one.  The first
five seemed to be of no consequence, being standard applications for a bank
account all drawing off of deposits from the first account, which in turn was
to be created from a wire transfer from a bank in the United Kingdom.
     Susan Meiou, he read silently.  Michelle Kaiou.  Alexis Ten&#39;ou.  Rei Hino.
Serena Tsukino.  He then picked up the yellow-flagged folder and skimmed the
hand-written sticky note on the inside cover.  Darian Chiba, existing account
(checking/savings), will need his written permission to continue.
     The orange folder, belonging to one Ami Mizuno and flagged as a relational
or &#39;legacy&#39; account, took a few seconds to figure out.  Ah, so this must be her
daughter, he said as he came across the name Dr. Amelia Anderson in the notes.
Dr. Anderson was one of the more prestigious customers of the bank, given her
role and reputation as a trauma surgeon at the hospital, and he had gotten to
know her personally after having his appendix removed by her three years ago.
     His hand was halfway to the phone with the intent of calling over to the
hospital to ask her if she knew anything about this when he suddenly hesitated.
Granted one of the lower-level managers or supervisors should have placed a
friendly call to her the instant her daughter&#39;s name came up on an application
that she hadn&#39;t signed off on, but something in the back of his mind was trying
to warn him that there might be far more to the situation than initially met
the eye.  It was an instinct that had served him quite well over the years,
enough to have helped him climb the corporate ladder to his current executive
position, and thus wasn&#39;t a voice that he lightly ignored.
     Let&#39;s see, he thought as he turned to the first red-flagged folder.  He
only needed to glance at the name to remember everything there was about that
particular account, including information that wasn&#39;t in the bank&#39;s database.
Leda Kino, he read silently.  Now why is your name coming up on a new account?
And one opened by someone else that I&#39;ve never met before, let alone have any
reason to believe is related to you?  This is getting very, very bothersome....
     His eyes finally passed over the last name in the stack, causing him to
sit back and study the folder very carefully.  Mina Aino, he thought as a very
faint chill seeped into his blood, the real-life identity of the mysterious
Sailor V.  Why are you popping up on my radar again like this?  And I know for
a fact that if you really did want to open a bank account in your real name,
you certainly wouldn&#39;t be doing it here.  Now I&#39;m *positive* something isn&#39;t
right with any of this.
     He closed his eyes and gave very serious consideration to lighting up a
cigar, one of the few remaining vices that he had.  The cigarettes had been
dispensed with a decade ago and he didn&#39;t smoke his cigars very often, but once
in a while the craving would return just long enough to drive him to light up
for a half-hour or so.
     Nine filings at once, he thought to himself.  All ordinary dual checking-
savings combination accounts, all submitted by the same individual and all
financed by a quarter-million British pounds wired from good ol&#39; Edgar Bloom
in jolly old England.  The wire should be legit, but I&#39;ll place a quiet call to
his secretary tonight just to make sure.  Nine people, apparently all women
save for Mr. Chiba who&#39;s been with us for a few years now.  The list includes
three people whom I strongly doubt would be opening an account on their own,
especially seeing how two of them know me personally.
     This smells of one of two things, he summarized with a soft sigh.  Either
it&#39;s fraud, in which case Ms. Meiou will have a great deal of explaining to do
to the police, or there is something else here that I&#39;m not convinced I really
want to know about.  However, *not* knowing really isn&#39;t an option in this line
of work, so I will have to ask a few questions.  I have the sneaking suspicion
that this is going to be a very long night, he sighed as he leaned forward to
pick up the phone.
     The number dialed was not one found in his Rolodex, but rather engraved
into his memory.  The other end rung a couple of times before someone picked up
and a teenaged voice said, &quot;Seventh Street Pizza.&quot;
     &quot;I would like to speak with Sal, please,&quot; the banker said.
     &quot;Sure, hang on,&quot; the teen replied before the line was muted.  There was
the faintest of humming noises before the line was opened up again.  &quot;Seventh
Street Pizza,&quot; a familiar and somewhat gruff voice said absently.
     &quot;There is a storm gathering on the horizon,&quot; the executive said calmly.
     As always, there was a moment of hesitation on the other end of the line
followed by a somewhat weary sigh.  &quot;But the winds are calm for the moment,&quot;
the restaurant owner answered, able to recognize the voice as being one of the
few who regularly made use of the coded exchange.
     &quot;I need to leave a message for her,&quot; the executive said.
     &quot;One sec,&quot; the other voice said as there was the sound of a drawer being
opened up.  &quot;Alright.&quot;
     &quot;Call your bank,&quot; the banker said simply.
     &quot;That&#39;s it?&quot; Sal inquired cautiously.
     &quot;That&#39;s it,&quot; he confirmed.
     &quot;I&#39;ll let her know soon as I can,&quot; Sal promised before he hung up.  He
cast a weary glance at the floor beneath him before standing up, easing out
from behind the somewhat ratty desk.  He absently folded the napkin in half as
he carried it out of what passed for his office and headed into the restaurant
proper.  Things were somewhat busy at the moment, being lunch-time and all, but
it was nowhere close to being as busy as they usually were during dinner or
weekend hours.
     &quot;How we doin&#39; so far?&quot; he asked the teen waitress at the counter as he
came up beside her and slipped his manager&#39;s key into the cash register.  He
twisted the key to the right and the tray popped open, allowing him to quickly
eyeball how much money was inside.
     &quot;Not too bad,&quot; the waitress replied, absently running a manicured hand
through her Kool-Aid-dyed greenish-blonde hair.  &quot;So far, so good.&quot;
     &quot;Great,&quot; Sal said as he closed the register and took his key out.  While
he was doing that, he slipped the folded napkin under the register and pushed
a nearly invisible button set into the underside of the counter.  Outside, the
neon sign that read &quot;7th ST Pizza&quot; began to flicker just slightly, making the
superscripted &#39;th&#39; section seem like it was running out of neon gas to burn.
The flickering would continue until the button was pressed again, which would
only be done when someone said the proper coded phrase.
     &quot;Everything alright in the back?&quot; the teen inquired idly.  &quot;Someone called
for you a few minutes ago and I tossed it back there, or at least I thought I
did.  Mute, flash, star-one, then hang-up, right?&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, I got it,&quot; Sal replied.  &quot;Routine business and all.  Lunch should
stay quiet like this, but dinner tonight should be fun.  You know how it goes
some days,&quot; he sighed.
     &quot;I&#39;ll be ready,&quot; the teen promised with a smile.
     Yeah, Sal thought to himself as he headed back to his tiny office, this is
going to be fun.  He knew it would be several hours before someone would stop
by to claim the message, as there had been an understanding reached awhile ago
about timing issues.  She needs to get a cellphone and an answering service or
something one of these days, he thought darkly with another sigh.  Had I known
I&#39;d be her go-between, I&#39;d have told her to take a hike and let those goons in
the alley finish me off.  Some days it just isn&#39;t worth the hassle....

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Major?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired calmly as he watched Sirene essentially remove
the front half of her throat.  The pair of glowing monofiliment wires promptly
disintegrated on exposure to the atmosphere, breaking the connection between
the implant in what was left of her voice box and the vocoder unit.  A soft
rasping noise started up as the surgical hole in her trachea became exposed,
allowing air to enter and exit the normally-sealed gap as she breathed.
     Sirene made a universal gesture of asking for patience while she brought
the inside of the device up to her lips and blew a puff of air at it, as if she
was trying to blow off a layer of dust.  She examined the exposed leads of the
device before carefully reconnecting it to its proper position over her throat.
The vocoder gave off a faint humming sound as it regenerated the monofiliment
wires and rebuilt the sound matrix from read-only memory.
     &lt;Aaaaah,&gt; Sirene hummed quietly before she seemed to relax.  &lt;I apologize,
sir, the vocoder connection must not have been socketed properly this morning.
I usually can tell right away when that happens, but sometimes it will work for
several minutes before it comes loose.&gt;
     &quot;We all have had those mornings,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied in a bemused tone.  &quot;A
pity that few problems are as easily corrected as that.  As I was asking, how
long would it take to make your Ghost aircraft available for flight?&quot;
     &lt;It would probably take more time for me to go change into my flight-suit
than for my wing to be made ready,&gt; Sirene replied without hesitation.  &lt;With
the hangers being as empty as they are right now, there is very little for the
service crews to be occupied with in terms of aircraft maintenance.  In fact,
I will be surprised if there is anything that needs to be done at this very
moment other than a basic fuel and supply check.&gt;
     &quot;Excellent,&quot; the armored general nodded, fully expecting to have heard
such an answer.  &quot;And your aircraft can seat two people, correct?&quot;
     Sirene blinked and regarded him carefully, suddenly getting the feeling
that he wasn&#39;t asking simply for a status report.  &lt;It can, if you don&#39;t mind
the tight quarters,&gt; she replied in a faintly wary tone.
     &quot;How tight?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis prodded.
     &lt;The seats are back-to-back, so the pilot won&#39;t have to worry about anyone
riding in her lap, but there isn&#39;t a lot of elbow room once you get situated.
I imagine it would only be a little worse than your tank,&gt; Sirene added as a
brief after-thought.  &lt;A claustrophobic would go insane, but you can sneeze
without impaling yourself on any of the instruments.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis grunted quietly to himself and absently flexed his wings.  &quot;I
see,&quot; he said in a faintly distracted tone.  &quot;I will be blunt with you, Major,
as time is not in ample supply.  Would you be able to take me as a passenger
in your aircraft for a rather unique mission?&quot;
     Even though half of her face was hidden behind a metal mask of implants,
what was left was still more than capable of showing a wide arrange of emotions
and reactions.  &lt;Are you serious?&gt; she blurted out, her forehead wrinkling to
suggest that her eyebrows would have been arched clear up to her hairline if
she still had them.
     &quot;Perfectly serious, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said calmly.
     Sirene blinked hard and took a half-step back to study him, changing the
optic filters in her eyes to see the indistinct outline of his body beneath the
exotic metal of his armor.  She then thought very carefully about just how much
room she had to play with in the back seat of her Ghost-class support craft.
     &lt;Truthfully, sir?&gt; she said a cautious tone.  She waited until she got a
somber nod before continuing, &lt;You might be able to fit if you can fold your
wings around you carefully, but there&#39;s simply no way with your armor on.  We
have avian pilots, of course, so finding you a flight-suit designed for winged
backs won&#39;t be a problem.&gt;
     &quot;That was expected, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with a simple shrug.  &quot;Indeed,
a flight-suit has been kept in storage for me for just such an occasion.  Will
there be enough space in the external storage compartment for my armor?&quot;
     &lt;Most likely, though I don&#39;t know how compactly you can stow it,&gt; Sirene
hedged carefully.
     &quot;We shall simply have to see, then,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis stated with another casual
shrug of dismissal.  &quot;The current idea right now is for me to pay a very quiet
visit to the Imperial Castle and have a face-to-face conversation with Fleet
Admiral Si&#39;ren about the current state of affairs, and when I say a quiet visit
I mean one where we remain as invisible to the sensors as possible.  Correct me
if I&#39;m wrong, Major, but I believe that only your Ghost aircraft can accomplish
a successful launch from a cloaked carrier without detection.&quot;
     &lt;A launch, no,&gt; Sirene replied as she felt the remains of breakfast turn
into an icy slush.  &lt;There would simply be too much of a kinetic disturbance
from the catapults.  An unpowered combat drop, however, would likely work.  I
can.... well, ghost for a fair distance before needing to light up the engines
and regain some altitude.  Even if that gives away my presence, I will still be
far enough away from the V&#39;ral that nobody should be able to extrapolate its
position, especially if they change course after the drop.&gt;
     &quot;Excellent,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with a hint of satisfaction to his tone.  &quot;I
still have a few things to do before I can turn control of the carrier over to
Brigadier Sor&#39;en, but I should be ready before the eleventh hour.  I trust your
aircraft can be prepared for this mission by then?&quot; he inquired.
     &lt;With all due respect, General Ar&#39;kanis?&gt; Sirene said as she squared her
shoulders and braced herself.  &lt;I don&#39;t think I can comply with that order.&gt;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said calmly, tilting his head at a slight angle.  He had
long gained enough experience to not become upset in the slightest whenever a
subordinate told him &#39;no&#39; with varying degrees of respect, as more often than
not they did so with very valid reasons.  &quot;Please explain.&quot;
     &lt;Sir, did you miss the recent weather update?&gt; she asked carefully.
     &quot;It&#39;s possible I may have,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis admitted.
     &lt;There&#39;s a lume centered on the Imperial Castle right now,&gt; Sirene said,
relaxing slightly as she realized that she wasn&#39;t about to be chewed out for
not immediately rushing off to prepare her aircraft.  &lt;Even if I were to ignore
the radiation levels still present in the region, the lume consists of a hyper-
tornado completely surrounding the Castle, hurricane-force winds coming from
all quadrants, and a density of rain that I can guarantee you will choke any
air-intakes.  The Ghost-class of aircraft may have very stable flight profiles,
but both basic physics and common sense mandates it&#39;s a no-fly zone for now.&gt;
     A soft echo of faint amusement could be heard echoing inside his helmet.
&quot;Indeed.  Had a spare tank been left aboard, I would have Sor&#39;en simply drop me
off in a flat space and drive to the Castle, even under those conditions, but
my choices are limited at the moment.  Very well, Major, we will delay this
until the weather is clear enough for your needs.  Unless, of course, you wish
for another pilot to be chosen in your stead,&quot; he added lightly.
     It took Sirene several seconds to decide how to respond to him.  &lt;Sir?  If
I may ask.... why did you ask me personally instead of drawing from the pool?&gt;
she inquired, referring to the usual way of randomly selecting a pilot for such
&#39;unique&#39; missions.
     &quot;For your unique vision, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied quietly.  &quot;Or rather,
for what you don&#39;t see.  I am quite willing to travel without wearing my armor,
but it is always worn for a good reason.&quot;
     &lt;I don&#39;t understand what you mean by what I don&#39;t see,&gt; Sirene replied in
a faintly uncomfortable tone.  Like everyone else among the Red Wings, she too
was more than a little curious as to what he looked like beneath the imposing
armor he always wore.  It was rumored that only the Chief Medical Officer knew
and that he had been sworn to absolute secrecy about the matter.  Many had gone
on to discreetly ask the CMO about it, only to be brushed aside with a gentle
but iron-clad reminder of doctor-patient confidentiality rules.  Some have even
suggested that Nop&#39;tera herself didn&#39;t know, though nobody had yet dared to try
to ask her about the matter fearing her ire at prying into Ar&#39;kanis&#39; privacy.
     &quot;I thought you had difficulty with the visible-light spectrum?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
said carefully, suddenly wondering if he had been mistaken.
     A flat burst of static erupted from her vocoder as she snorted in disdain.
&lt;Whomever told you that was very much mistaken,&gt; she pointed out.  &lt;If I turn
off or remove my implants I&#39;m blind, of course, but as long as they&#39;re working
as designed I can see light and color just fine.  I can see much more than the
visible-light spectrum and that sometimes makes it hard to focus on what color
a given object is instead of how it&#39;s constructed, but I can narrow that focus
down well enough if given a moment.&gt;
     &quot;I see,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said quietly.  &quot;Humor me for a moment, Major.  Are you
able to see through my armor?&quot;
     &lt;Somewhat,&gt; Sirene replied as she carefully studied him again.  &lt;I can use
different filters to see through your armor, but there is little detail to be
resolved from that.  I can tell that there&#39;s nothing wrong with the formation
of your bones, if that helps any,&gt; she offered in an attempt at humor.
     &quot;And my skin?&quot; he added in an even quieter tone.
     Sirene paused and glanced down at his arms.  It took her several seconds
to find the right balance of sensors and filters to penetrate both the armor
and his undersuit without going too deeply.  &lt;I see nothing wrong, sir,&gt; she
said slowly.  &lt;I am not a physician, of course, so I cannot say if you have an
unknown skin condition or anything, but I don&#39;t detect anything obvious aside
from a few scars.  With all due respect, sir, you seem to have less than I do,&gt;
she pointed out with another note of attempted humor.  &lt;Although I must admit
that your armor is blocking the majority of my scans.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis looked at her in silence for a number of moments before quickly
glancing around the empty room.  He then reached over and removed the armored
gauntlet from his right hand, exposing his skin.  &quot;And now?&quot; he said, almost
too softly for her to hear.
     Sirene blinked and glanced down at his hand, studying it carefully.  It
didn&#39;t appear to be all that different from any other denizen&#39;s hand, save for
the fact that the bones in his fingers ended in sharpened points much like the
claws of a Felinoid.  She found herself having a slight difficulty resolving
the visible-light portion of his skin, unable to determine for certain what hue
it was, but other than that she saw absolutely nothing of significance.
     &lt;I still don&#39;t see anything abnormal, sir,&gt; she finally said with a faint
shrug.  &lt;I don&#39;t envy that scar on your forearm, but I know what it&#39;s like to
wind up with them.&gt;
     &quot;Thank you, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with an almost inaudible echo of relief
as he slipped his armored glove back on.  &quot;I think that sufficiently validated
my understanding of how your vision works.  Please keep an eye on that lume
surrounding the Imperial Castle and notify me immediately once it dissipates.
I will be on the Bridge,&quot; he instructed as he started to turn away.
     &lt;Sir?&gt; Sirene spoke up, causing the armored figure to pause.  &lt;If I may
ask a personal question.... what was I supposed to have seen?&gt; she inquired in
a very careful and respectful tone.
     Ar&#39;kanis paused and sighed quietly to himself, looking at the wall of the
room instead of at her.  &quot;You will not speak of this to anyone else, not even
to General Nop&#39;tera herself.  If you indeed saw nothing, Major, then consider
yourself fortunate.  Warriors who have endured far more in life than you have
seen me unmasked and ungloved, only to run screaming from my presence.  I wear
this armor for protection.... not for myself, but for the sake of others.  I
trust I need not bother with details about what will happen should another hear
of this from your lips, natural or artificial?&quot; he added in a chilling tone as
he finally glanced in her direction.
     &lt;Understood, General,&gt; Sirene said as she snapped to perfect attention.
     &quot;Thank you, Major.  Dismissed,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied simply.  He closed his
eyes and remained perfectly still as she departed the room, wondering if he had
finally said too much or allowed someone too deep of a glimpse inside.  There
were several others who knew what he looked like, of course, as he did have
regular medical exams by the Chief Medical Officer and rarely by one of the
other medical staff.  He had long become accustomed to his armored isolation,
however, building up both his character and reputation around the mystique of
his imposing armor.  Not that he wasn&#39;t equally as imposing physically, as he
very much was, but the armor merely added an extra layer to the effect that he
would rather not see diminished or otherwise tainted.
     He glanced down at his hands, absently flexing his fingers as he wondered
how long it had been since he had touched another living being in a meaningful
way.  Granted he had briefly touched Nop&#39;tera&#39;s face earlier, and before that
had to tie her down during the drug-induced psychotic reaction, but what about
before then?  No, he hadn&#39;t been touched even remotely like that, not since....
     Enough, he commanded himself as the memories returned once again.  It had
taken him weeks to get the incident out of his conscious mind where they had
subsequently lain dormant for decades.  But after seeing Nop&#39;tera in the throes
of psychosis and lending his strength to help her fight for control, the dark
memories had returned with a haunting vengeance.  He had successfully seduced
a small number of women in the past, even after the Chaos Factor had taken hold
and transformed him to what he was now, but never before had someone turned the
proverbial tables on him like that, least of all a legend....
     &quot;General Ar&#39;kanis, to the bridge,&quot; the wall speaker suddenly said without
warning, jolting him out of his thoughts.
     He paused to regain his bearings before striding over towards the door,
his mind already shoving the thoughts and memories into a dimly-lit corner of
his consciousness for later review.  It was more of a reflex than anything, as
he knew he would need a fully clear mind for whatever lay ahead.  As for what
that would entail, he knew he&#39;d find out once he got there.
     He only stopped long enough to half-gently bash his armored fist against
one of the buttons on the wall speaker.  &quot;I&#39;m on my way,&quot; he said simply and
resumed walking towards the nearest lift.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;This is so stupid,&quot; Alex said ruefully as she continued to watch the game
show on the television.  She was perched on the end of the couch and leaning
over the coffee table so that she could munch on her sandwich without making
too hideous of a mess.  &quot;And people are entertained by this?&quot;
     &lt;You&#39;re still watching, aren&#39;t you?&gt; Whisper telepathed with a chuckle as
she chewed on her own lunch.  &lt;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be watching this particular
one again, but I have to admit I like the other one.  More intellectual, I
suppose, instead of a somewhat questionable game of chance.&gt;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Alex huffed quietly as she took another large bite.  &quot;Vu ha&#39;fa &#39;no
w&#39;at vey mean firs&#39;.&quot;
     &quot;Exactly,&quot; Whisper said aloud as she cast a mild glance at the blonde as
she continued to eat.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand half of the cultural references of
this world, but by watching these kinds of programs in my spare time, I&#39;m able
to slowly learn.  Sometimes I can keep up with Mina for three whole minutes at
a stretch when she gets started on who said what to whom on these soap operas
and other social sagas, cheap and sappy as they are.&quot;
     Alex made a face and swallowed noisily.  &quot;Ugh,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;If Mina is
watching this crap all the time, it would explain her brain-rot.  Seriously, I
really don&#39;t see much use coming from this stuff.  Hell, we only watched that
one program for a few minutes and I told you that he was a lying, cheating,
scummy dirtbag of a boyfriend.  And it took her how long to find out, half the
show?  Please,&quot; she scoffed.
     &quot;It&#39;s called drama,&quot; Whisper said dryly.  &quot;And not everyone is as jaded as
you are when it comes to men.  Okay, so a lot of them really are pigs,&quot; she
added with a shrug.  &quot;But they&#39;re not *all* bad.  It sometimes takes a few
hundred years of searching, but the good ones can be found if you look in all
the right places.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll pass, thanks,&quot; Alex muttered darkly.  &quot;Besides, I already have Mich
to put a smile on my face, why would I want some guy trying to cozy up to me
while he&#39;s sneaking around behind my back trying to bed the neighbors as well?&quot;
     Whisper just sighed quietly and tried not to imagine the look that was
crossing Michelle&#39;s face over at the table.  &quot;As I said, it&#39;s just drama for
the purpose of cheap entertainment,&quot; the telepath spoke up carefully.  &quot;Very
few people actually behave like that, Jerry Springer notwithstanding,&quot; she said
with a truly rueful shake of her head.  She had only seen the show twice, both
times because Mina had turned it on during an idle moment, and that had been
more than enough for her sense of curiosity.
     &quot;Like I said, this stuff will rot your brain,&quot; Alex grumbled as she cast
an absent glance at a somewhat tacky and flashy commercial.  &quot;And I don&#39;t even
need Sue to stop and point that out for me, either.&quot;
     The mention of Susan&#39;s name immediately reminded the telepath of what had
occurred barely an hour ago, resulting in a prompt souring of her stomach and
a very quiet sigh.  She had turned on the television in the hopes that it would
be mind-numbing enough to help clear out the chaotic thoughts, and by the time
the second game show had started it was a largely successful endeavor.  Or it
had been until a few moments ago.
     The image of the black crescent moon on Renee&#39;s forehead simply wouldn&#39;t
go away.  It was virtually identical to the golden sigil that manifested on her
forehead at first, save for the fact that the tips of the crescent moon pointed
downwards.  Whisper knew for a fact that the rest of the Sailor Scouts were
quite familiar with the mark of the Royal House of the Moon, but she had the
disturbing feeling that only Darian would be able to recognize the black moon
as being the sign of the Negaverse&#39;s royal bloodline.  And if they were both
present in the same person, then Renee could only be....
     The sudden feeling of a slightly cold and wet nose brushing against her
earlobe was like a lightning bolt, shocking her out of her thoughts and causing
her to quite literally leap out of the chair.  A defensive reflex kicked in a
fraction of a second later, tripling the intensity of her &#39;casual&#39; psionic
shields while lashing out with a moderate-strength burst of unfocused mental
energy designed to briefly play havoc with the synapses of unshielded minds.
     &quot;Ow, ow, ow, goddamnit!&quot; Alex yelped as she dropped what was left of her
sandwich to clutch her head.  A sharp clattering sound was heard from the table
as Michelle&#39;s fork fell into her salad bowl, accompanied by a pained keening
whimper as she too was briefly staggered by the panicked burst of psi-energy.
     &quot;Myst!&quot; Whisper panted as she calmed down and realized what the problem
had been.  The gray kitten was still perched on the arm of her chair, her ears
folded flat against her head with a visible look of pain and suffering on her
face.  Her tail was twisted into a complicated shape that made a pretzel seem
straight by comparison, seeming to tremble just slightly as she otherwise stood
perfectly still.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, you startled me.  Is everyone alright?&quot; the
telepath asked as she glanced around the rest of the room.
     &quot;Ow,&quot; Alex groaned as she rubbed her temples.  The initial headache was
largely gone by now, but there was still a bit of lingering soreness from the
psionic attack as her synapses continued to recover.  &quot;Damn, can&#39;t you just
swat the cat like the rest of us next time?&quot; she complained.
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Whisper apologized with a heavy sigh, feeling more than a
little sheepish for having lashed out in a panic like that.  She made a soft
grunting sound as Myst cast a truly evil glare in her direction before seeming
to melt into the chair cushions and vanishing from sight.  &quot;Great,&quot; she said,
mostly to herself before a sudden thought occurred to her.  &quot;Hang on, I&#39;ll be
right back,&quot; she said to Alex and Michelle before she turned her focus inward
to use her dimension-phasing power.
     The room immediately seemed to darken and warp into a twisted shape as she
slipped into the demiplane, an unexpected effect that immediately worried her.
Alex&#39;s surprised face melted away until she was a wispy yellow outline sitting
on the spectral shape of what looked to be the couch.  Much to her surprise,
the glittering outline of the normally-invisible Soul Saber could be seen with
a moderate degree of clarity hanging from her back.  The blade wasn&#39;t any more
distinct than the rest of the environment but was still easily discernible as
a visible object.
     Michelle was still sitting at the table, now little more than a ghostly
figure surrounded by an aquamarine aura.  At the small of her back was a metal
object of some sort that was unusually reflective, seeming to glitter like a
beacon in the near-darkness of the twisted realm Whisper found herself in.  It
took her a moment to realize that the object was Michelle&#39;s Soul Mirror tucked
away in her Lunar Space pocket.
     But what surprised her the most was the pinkish.... *thing* that seemed to
be hovering in mid-air where the armchair used to be.  Unlike the rest of the
surroundings, the blob seemed to be quite defined in terms of detail and color.
     &lt;Myst?&gt; Whisper telepathed carefully, not sure if her psionic senses were
fully functional in the twisted and obviously spectral demiplane.  She blinked
as she found her telepathic shields flaring under an attack of some sort, her
eyes almost doubling in diameter as she saw a physical manifestation of the
shields taking shape around her head.
     She paused to study the Shinma, not entirely sure if she had tried to
reply to her or if the attack had been a result of something else.  She sent
out a very weak psionic signal, akin to a light tapping on the shoulder, and
found herself under a considerably weaker psionic attack once again.  She then
tried a repeat of that experiment using a series of quick psi-pulses and was
promptly rewarded with an equal number of rapid but easily-blocked attacks on
her mental defenses.
     Great, she thought to herself, this place is telepathically reflective.
An extremely icy chill promptly flooded her veins as she realized that if her
surroundings were psionically-reactive as well, she might not be able to shift
back to the original plane of existence without triggering a potentially nasty
reaction of some sort.
     She paused as she caught motion out of the corner of her eye and watched
as Myst, or at least what she thought was her, started to move downwards at an
angle.  The telepath blinked in surprise as the Shinma passed through the floor
as if it didn&#39;t exist.  Out of simple reflex, Whisper tapped her foot carefully
and nearly threw herself off-balance as encountered only insubstantial air.
     Ay&#39;cha navidshi! she thought in a slight panic.  So what am I standing on
if solid objects don&#39;t exist in here?  She glanced down at the retreating pink
blob and decided that she would worry about Myst later, since it was obvious
that the Shinma was already familiar with this demiplane and thus wouldn&#39;t be
in any danger.  But as for herself, being inside a somewhat hideously twisted
dimensional reflection of the &#39;normal&#39; world where her own psionic powers were
echoed back at her and solid objects were anything but solid, she was getting
the distinct impression that remaining there was not an overly wise idea.
     Let&#39;s hope this works, she thought as she braced herself and reversed the
Chaos Factor power that had allowed her to slip into the demiplane.  There was
a distinctly horrific wrenching feeling before she found her nerves under an
intense assault that threatened to overwhelm her.  The rush of color and sound
was both blinding and deafening, but the wave of pure psionic energy was enough
to leave her conscious mind dazed even despite her mental shields.
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Alex blurted out as Whisper suddenly faded into view, only to fall
back and collapse into the armchair.  &quot;Whisper!&quot;
     &quot;Not.... so.... loud....&quot; the telepath moaned softly as she slowly got her
bearings and struggled to sit up straight.  &quot;Ohhh, that hurt....&quot;
     &quot;Are you alright?&quot; Michelle asked in a muted tone as she approached, her
face a mask of worry and concern.
     &quot;It&#39;s just a momentary headache.  I think,&quot; Whisper said in a tone that
suggested she wasn&#39;t entirely certain.  The wave of psionic energy had receded
as quickly as it had come, leaving her just slightly disoriented as her mental
shields recovered from the attack.
     Alex wrinkled her nose and picked up the remains of her sandwich.  &quot;No
sympathy,&quot; she muttered darkly, feeling her skull twinge just slightly in a
reminder of the accidental psi-spike she had received a few minutes earlier.
     Michelle shot her a dark look before turning back to Whisper.  &quot;So what
happened?&quot; she asked carefully.  &quot;You faded out like a ghost a few moments ago,
just like Myst did, then you suddenly reappeared without warning.&quot;
     &quot;I think I followed Myst into that demiplane she mentioned,&quot; the telepath
explained as she rubbed her temples.  &quot;Dimension-shifting is the other major
power I gained after the Chaos Factor woke up.  Back in the Negaverse, it let
me slip into a shadow-like world that didn&#39;t seem to be directly tied to the
rest of the plane.  In this world, however, it seems to be a really twisted....
echo, I guess, of everything around me.  Nothing was solid, and trying to use
my psionic powers resulted in a reflective backlash.  I think that&#39;s what had
hurt me when I shifted back here,&quot; she added ruefully.
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Alex said in a somewhat thoughtful tone.  &quot;You should probably talk
to Sue about it, she&#39;s our resident expert on dimensions and all that crap.  If
you can get a straight answer out of her about it,&quot; she added darkly as she
turned her attention back to lunch.
     A very soft grunt rose up from Whisper&#39;s throat at the reminder of how it
didn&#39;t appear to be easy at all to get a full answer from the succubus.  &quot;I&#39;ll
be sure to mention it to her once she returns.  Hmm?&quot; she said to herself as
she heard her communicator unit start chirping quietly.  She dug it out of her
pocket and glanced at it, her light green eyebrows arching up in curiosity as
she saw the Jupiter sigil blinking at her.  She brushed her thumb over the icon
and Leda&#39;s face promptly appeared on the tiny display screen.  &quot;Yes?&quot; she said,
blinking as it appeared that the brunette was calling her from a bathroom.
     &quot;Hey, quick question,&quot; Leda said in a muted tone.  &quot;Is Susan around?  Got
a question I&#39;d like to ask her.&quot;
     Whisper shook her head.  &quot;No, she&#39;s still out taking care of whatever it
is she said she needed to do.  I don&#39;t expect her back until dinner.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Leda sighed, making a sour face.  &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll ask her about it
then.  Thanks anyway,&quot; she said before her image abruptly winked out.
     Whisper looked up from the display as she heard Alex laugh quietly to
herself and mutter some unintelligible comment beneath her breath.  &quot;Something
wrong, Alex?&quot; she inquired in a wary tone.
     The blonde simply made a dismissive motion with the crust of her sandwich.
&quot;Nah,&quot; she mumbled before she swallowed.  &quot;It&#39;s always been like this.  Sue
steps out for a day to take care of business, and half the palace stops by to
ask us if we know where she went.  And the funny thing is that they all have
minor piddly questions to ask of her, like they can&#39;t think for themselves or
something.&quot;
     Whisper nodded in understanding, remembering how things went when both
Queen Beryl and the division commanders weren&#39;t available to answer questions
or give orders to the rest of the military.  &quot;I think I know what you mean,&quot;
she replied in a knowing tone.  She blinked as the communicator in her hand
began to chirp again, this time lighting up the red Rose symbol associated with
Darian&#39;s communicator.  &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; she said quietly before she thumbed the line
open.  &quot;Darian, is everything alright?&quot; she asked as soon as the saw the look
on his face.
     &quot;Yes and no,&quot; Darian replied in a flat tone.  &quot;I&#39;m fine, but I need to
talk to Susan.  Immediately,&quot; he added darkly.
     Whisper paused for a moment as Alex promptly crammed the remainder of her
lunch into her mouth, obviously fighting the urge to laugh aloud.  &quot;She is not
here at the moment,&quot; she said in a leery tone.  &quot;Why, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     &quot;I ran into her sister earlier today,&quot; Darian&#39;s image muttered in a low
tone.  &quot;Megan.  And a few moments ago our vice-president was carted out of here
in a body-bag after apparently suffering a heart-attack.  Seems he was fooling
around with a new intern and couldn&#39;t keep up.  Guess who that &#39;intern&#39; turned
out to be?&quot; he said ominously.
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Whisper said very quietly.  She paused and waited to make sure
that the sound she heard from the couch wasn&#39;t Alex choking on her sandwich
before she took in a deep breath.  &quot;Uh, yes, I can see why that would be more
than a little.... suspicious.  Susan isn&#39;t here, your Highness, but I will ask
her about it as soon as she returns.  Which probably won&#39;t be until dinner,&quot;
she added quickly.
     Darian made an inarticulate grunting sound to himself before nodding in
understanding.  &quot;Great.  Remind me later to ask Luna about getting a few more
communicator units built for her and the others so I don&#39;t end up bothering you
for something crazy like this again.&quot;
     &quot;Trust me, I&#39;ll be sure to bring it up,&quot; Whisper replied dryly, thinking
about Leda&#39;s call not three minutes ago.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Darian said.  &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you later.  Out,&quot; he added as his
image winked out.
     &quot;Oh, crap,&quot; Alex rasped as she finished coughing, trying to clear the last
bread crumbs out from her throat.  &quot;I know Maggie told us earlier about what
she was going to do, but I didn&#39;t think it would be the same company Darian
works for....&quot;
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Whisper agreed with a sour expression, trying not to think about
the gleam of anticipation she had seen in Megan&#39;s eyes as she spoke about it.
&quot;Well, what can I say?  Even astronomical odds can be beaten if the numbers
come up just right.  Let&#39;s just hope it doesn&#39;t happen again anytime soon.&quot;
     &quot;Whisper?&quot; Michelle asked cautiously from the table, her fork still poised
over the remains of her salad.  &quot;Is everything alright?&quot;
     Alex and Whisper exchanged uneasy glances before the telepath sighed very
softly to herself.  &quot;For the most part, yes,&quot; she replied in a careful tone.
&quot;However, let&#39;s just say that the discussion at dinner tonight should be quite
interesting.  You said you finished with the dishes, right?&quot; she added.
     &quot;Oh, yes they&#39;re all done and put away,&quot; Michelle said, still giving Alex
an unsettled look as the blonde continued to very lightly cough to herself.
&quot;Alex, are you okay?&quot;
     Alex took a deep breath and let loose with a very forceful cough, sighing
in satisfaction as it finally dislodged the last fragment of crust.  &quot;Peachy,
babe,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;Bread was good, if a touch dry though,&quot; she said absently
as she rubbed her throat.
     Whisper just shook her head to herself, feeling yet another headache very
slowly moving in to take up residence in the front half of her skull.  Okay, so
maybe Myst is right about things getting chaotic around here, she grumbled to
herself.  Still, it was pretty quiet a few months ago, so things will quiet
back down eventually..... right?

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Hey, not so hard!&quot; Mina protested sourly as the volleyball was viciously
thumped by the opposing side.  It sailed high into the air where two dozen sets
of eyes watched as it seemed to take forever to plummet back down.  &quot;Out,&quot; she
called out in a dry tone as the ball landed a good ten feet out-of-bounds.
     &quot;Meh,&quot; one of the other players sighed.
     Mina winked at her and trotted over to pick up the ball.  &quot;Rotate!&quot; she
sang out as she pitched the volleyball over to the girl who had just stepped
back to the serving line.  &quot;C&#39;mon, Tina, you&#39;re up.  Make it count.&quot;
     &quot;Twelve serving seven,&quot; the brunette called out as she bounced the ball
off the ground, caught it, and immediately thumped it on the underside to send
it sailing over the net with barely an inch to spare.
     &quot;Good one, girl,&quot; Mina cheered as the other side scrambled to return the
service.  There was a near-collision as two of the girls both tried to bump it
up, but somehow things worked out for a near-perfect set by Molly.  The redhead
then dodged to the side to allow Serena to make a good-faith effort at a low-
intensity spike.  &quot;Oh, nice,&quot; Mina admitted as the volleyball seemed to zoom
over the net at a fairly steep angle.
     &quot;Mine,&quot; another girl announced as she lunged forward, almost eating the
grass as she managed to deflect the ball upwards on her wrists.  This sent the
volleyball on a lop-sided spiral towards Mina, who had all of half a second to
decide how to set it up for her team.  Sorry, Serena, she thought to herself
as she took a quick hop back to bounce the ball off of the inside of her arms.
&quot;Gail!&quot; she called out as she quickly backpedaled to make space.
     Gail, who was an inch taller than Leda and had dark hair cut even shorter
than Alex, promptly jumped up as high as she could and used both hands to slam
the ball downwards in a classic spike, deliberately trying to aim the ball to
the half-empty spot between Serena and Molly.  As expected, Serena panicked and
flinched from the bullet-like spike as it zoomed directly in front of her,
resulting in a point for Mina&#39;s team.
     &quot;Thirteen!&quot; someone called out in a gleeful tone.
     &quot;Dammit,&quot; Molly grumbled quietly as she watched the ball rebound off the
grass and start bouncing towards the fence line.
     &quot;I&#39;ll get it,&quot; Serena sighed, acutely aware of the muted grumbles from the
rest of her teammates.  She quickly jogged after the ball and caught up with it
just as it came to a halt a few inches away from the chain-linked fence that
separated the edge of the school grounds from one of the lesser-used city
streets.  As was expected for the time of day, there were only a handful of
people visible along the street walking along at varying casual paces.
     The dark chill didn&#39;t hit her until after she had heaved the ball back
towards the volleyball field, leaving her frozen in place for a brief instant
with her arms stretched out as her skin felt like it was turning inside-out.
The intensity was far stronger than she could ever remember feeling before, but
it was still one she could all too easily identify.  The Negaverse, she thought
in horror as she whipped around, furiously scanning the area for the source of
the dark vibe.
     Her frantic search lasted for only a few seconds before one of the passing
pedestrians paused and looked up from the small map he was holding.  Their eyes
met and Time seemed to literally freeze in its tracks as the shock of mutual
recognition registered.  They stared at one another in mute surprise before a
faint smile touched his lips and he bowed his head slightly, just enough to
indicate his awareness of her presence.
     &quot;Serena?&quot; Ami said quietly as she trotted over to where the blonde was
standing.  Like Serena, she too had felt the dark chill and had unobtrusively
left her own volleyball game to see what the problem was.  &quot;Are you....?&quot; she
started to say before she glanced over at what Serena was staring at, her face
turning dangerously pale in an instant.
     Jedyt tilted his head slightly to look at Ami before nodding at her as
well, the faint smile still touching his lips.  He continued to look at them
for another few moments before he smirked and turned away, looking down at his
map to regain his bearings and calmly continuing on his way.
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Serena said in a deathly-soft whisper, clearly conveying her fright
at the realization that he now knew where they went to school.
     &quot;Easy, girls,&quot; Mina said in a low tone as she approached the group, laying
a gentle hand on their shoulders.  &quot;He&#39;s not going to dare to do anything, not
with a good hundred witnesses or so around.  Just breathe, okay?&quot; she said, her
eyes never leaving Jedyt&#39;s retreating form for an instant.  &quot;Relax, if we have
to suit up today, it won&#39;t be his doing.  Just call it a hunch, okay?  Girl&#39;s
intuition and all that.&quot;
     &quot;Are you sure about that?&quot; Ami muttered in a flat tone, closing her eyes
and briefly giving in to the impulse to shiver.
     Mina cast a final glance at Jedyt&#39;s back before he disappeared around a
corner and slowly nodded to herself.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;Yeah, I am.
He&#39;s got places to be this evening, so I doubt he&#39;s going to be a butthead yet
again and try anything stupid that might get his ticket punched.  Look, you two
just breathe deep and go back to playing V-ball, okay?  Let me worry about what
our old friend is up to.  Trust me,&quot; she added as both Ami and Serena gave her
identical looks of unease.
     &quot;Mina, what are you up to?&quot; Ami prodded in a wary tone.
     &quot;Settle down, okay?&quot; Mina sighed quietly.  &quot;Look, I&#39;ll be blunt here.  If
anything does go down?  He&#39;s mine,&quot; she said ominously.  &quot;I&#39;ve been crossing
swords, as it were, with him long before either of you got involved.  You had
your shot on the airport runway.  If someone needs to step up and put him back
in his place, it&#39;s V&#39;s turn and she can handle that herself.  I&#39;m serious, you
just take it easy and *don&#39;t worry* about him any more.  I&#39;ll be keeping an eye
on him, alright?  Now come on, we&#39;ve still got a good fifteen minutes to kill
before it&#39;s time to hit the lockers and get ready to call it a day.  Back to
your own game, Bubbles,&quot; she added as she gave Ami a playful swat and a very
gentle shove back towards the other volleyball field.  &quot;Go on, I&#39;m still not
finished spiking the ball on Serena&#39;s foot yet....&quot;
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Serena protested out of pure reflex.
     &quot;Oh, don&#39;t give me that,&quot; Mina huffed as she continued to absently prod
Ami into leaving.  &quot;Molly is doing an excellent job covering for you, when she
can do it without running you over, and you had a really beautiful return spike
a few minutes ago.  I keep telling everyone that there&#39;s still hope for you
yet, but they just don&#39;t want to listen.  Speaking of which.... Ami, why are
you still here?&quot; she sighed.  &quot;C&#39;mon, shoo!  Your team needs you now more than
ever in their approaching moment of triumph and glory....&quot;
     &quot;Alright, already,&quot; Ami growled darkly.  She gave Serena a look of unease
before sighing quietly and heading back to rejoin her classmates.
     &quot;Mina, are you sure about this?&quot; Serena asked quietly as she followed the
other blonde back towards the first volleyball field.
     &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Mina replied without hesitation, flashing a cheerful smile at
her.  &quot;Seriously, I am.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I&#39;m not too happy with the idea
that he&#39;s still breathing and all, and I&#39;m really not thrilled to run into him
like this, but I think I know him well enough to have a fair idea of what he
might do.... and what he won&#39;t do.  If he does decide to bother us again for
whatever reason, it won&#39;t be today.  You just have to trust me,&quot; she cooed as
she patted her on the shoulder before trotting off to take up the empty slot on
her team.
     &quot;Feel better?&quot; one of the other girls said with a smirk.
     &quot;What, would you prefer I stuck around here with a gas cramp?&quot; Mina shot
back with a languid smile.  &quot;Kidding, just kidding.  So what&#39;s the score?&quot;
     &quot;Thirteen to twelve,&quot; was the slightly disgruntled reply.
     Mina blinked in surprise.  &quot;What happened?  I step out for a few and we
start tanking all of a sudden?  I know I&#39;m good, but c&#39;mon....&quot;
     The other girl glanced at the opposing team for a brief instant before she
leaned in closer.  &quot;We didn&#39;t start getting spanked until Molly realized that
Serena wouldn&#39;t be back right away and put the extra room to good use,&quot; she
muttered.  &quot;Next time we play?  Either get her on our side or come up with a
plan to keep her off of the net because she spikes harder than Gail does.&quot;
     &quot;Ouch,&quot; Mina winced.  She blinked hard as she heard the call for service
and looked up to find the volleyball making a very sharp beeline towards her.
She immediately brought her hands up in a modified set maneuver, more to kill
the ball&#39;s momentum than to set up a spike, and quickly lost all thoughts of
Jedyt in a sport where focus and paying attention was half the battle.

                *               *               *               *

     Tolaris didn&#39;t look up from the screen or pause his typing as he heard the
door chime quietly.  &quot;Enter,&quot; he said loudly, figuring that it was someone like
Maze or K&#39;tal to remind him it was time for lunch or something.  Is is time for
lunch? he thought as he cast a quick glance at the clock in the corner of the
computer terminal.  Oops, he added with a mental sigh as the time registered.
     &quot;Don&#39;t you ever quit working?&quot; a female voice said with quiet amusement.
     Tolaris blinked hard and twisted around to face his unexpected visitor,
his complexion taking on a distinctly gray pallor as his heart muscle briefly
twitched in surprise.  &quot;T&#39;Del,&quot; he said softly.
     &quot;I heard you were back,&quot; T&#39;Del said calmly as she glanced around the room
out of simple reflex.  &quot;I didn&#39;t see you in the cafeteria, so I figured you had
either forgotten it was time for lunch or were simply too busy to bother.  May
I?&quot; she asked as she gestured to the bed.
     It took him a few moments to realize that she was asking to sit down, as
he was using the lone chair in the room.  He immediately bolted to his feet and
grabbed the chair, swinging it around with the intent of carrying it across the
room to her.  &quot;Here, you can....&quot; he started to say before falling silent by a
raised hand.
     &quot;Tolaris,&quot; she sighed very softly, almost wistfully.  Piercing green eyes
met uneasy gray eyes before the faintest of smiles crossed the exquisite beauty
of her face.  &quot;You need to learn how to relax,&quot; she chided him as she strode
over to the bed and sat down on the corner.
     &quot;I know how to relax,&quot; he pointed out as he set the chair back down and
sat down in it.
     &quot;So you&#39;re just always edgy around me, then?&quot; she prodded lightly, one
delicate fiery-red eyebrow arching up in remote amusement.  She sighed softly
to herself at the look on his face and just shook her head gently.  &quot;With as
long as we&#39;ve known one another, you&#39;re still uneasy with me.&quot;
     &quot;Some things can&#39;t be helped,&quot; he muttered as his stomach tied itself into
a series of knots.  He glanced up at her and immediately took note of the way
her gaze remained focused on him, studying him with an intensity that made his
stomach squirm and wiggle all the more.  &quot;What?&quot; he asked softly.
     &quot;I never expected to see you again,&quot; T&#39;Del admitted quietly with a casual
shrug of one shoulder.  &quot;At least, not after your.... I hesitate to call it a
trial for treason, as it was a bit of a mockery of justice, but you know what
I am referring to.&quot;
     Tolaris nodded somberly as he tried to keep his breathing even.  &quot;I do.&quot;
     The redhead waited for him to say more, tilting her head slightly as she
realized that he wasn&#39;t about to volunteer anything further.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose
you have anything you&#39;d like to say about that?&quot; she prodded gently.  &quot;I knew
something was wrong when I heard about Shar-Tei&#39;s promotion, but it took me a
few days to get the full story from someone.&quot;
     &quot;If you have the full story, then you don&#39;t need me to say anything,&quot; the
Dragoon replied calmly.  &quot;I did what I felt was the right thing to do.&quot;
     A faint smile brushed her lips.  &quot;You always did, Tolaris,&quot; she murmured.
&quot;I ask that you indulge my curiosity, however, assuming it isn&#39;t classified.&quot;
     Tolaris resisted the impulse snort quietly at the irony that she had just
as many specialized and compartmented security clearances as he did, and that
was despite the fact that most of his were by simple virtue of his role as the
commanding officer of the military&#39;s elite intelligence division.  &quot;What are
you really asking me, T&#39;Del?&quot; he inquired in a faintly uneasy tone.
     T&#39;Del blinked in mild surprise and leaned back slightly.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she
said after a moment, sensing there was more to his brusqueness than his ever-
present unease when in her presence.  She glanced down at the generic carpeting
for a few moments before looking back up at him, gazing into his eyes.  &quot;Can I
still trust you, Tolaris?&quot; she inquired in a perfectly neutral tone.
     He returned her gaze in silence before slowly nodding.  &quot;You should still
be able to,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I have changed all that much during
my time on Earth, although I can&#39;t rule that out as I of course can&#39;t be fully
objective.&quot;
     A soft laugh ghosted past her lips even as they settled into a warm and
gentle smile.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve changed much, either,&quot; she observed
lightly, giving him a look that most others would have called coy.  She looked
at him with open amusement before she sighed and her mood seemed to change.
     &quot;T&#39;Del, why are you here?&quot; Tolaris suddenly said, surprising them both.
     &quot;In which sense of the word?&quot; she inquired, arching one eyebrow up.  &quot;In
this region, in this unit, in this facility, or in your quarters?&quot;
     &quot;In this remote desert will suffice,&quot; Tolaris replied with just a faint
hint of dryness to his tone.  &quot;We both know that with your talents....&quot;
     &quot;My career,&quot; she interrupted him gently, waiting for him to fall silent
before continuing, &quot;Has always been my business, much like your own has always
been yours.  We have both done what we liked, Tolaris, and like you, I have
very few regrets about the career paths I&#39;ve taken since we became of age.  As
I keep having to explain to my crew chief, I do like working with my hands,&quot;
she said as she raised her hands slightly, very gently flexing them for a few
seconds.
     Tolaris nodded in understanding, absently making note of the fact that her
skin was still as utterly flawless as it had been in the past.  &quot;Go on,&quot; he
said simply with an absent gesture.
     She paused and regarded him very carefully before leaning back slightly
with a faint smile on her face.  &quot;Surely you of all people know why I have been
working with Sector Seven for awhile,&quot; she said, her tone taking on a slight
suggestion of both huskiness and challenge.
     &quot;I have my theories,&quot; Tolaris allowed softly.  &quot;Your records are still
sealed with the highest level of protocols that I&#39;ve ever encountered, however,
so I can&#39;t be absolutely certain of several things.&quot;
     &quot;A pity,&quot; T&#39;Del sighed wistfully.  &quot;No matter, you may rest assured that
I am still a genuine vehicle mechanic and fusion specialist, and that is what
they are paying me for.&quot;
     &quot;Officially,&quot; Tolaris pointed out in a perfectly neutral tone.
     &quot;We all have our little secrets, Tolaris,&quot; she reminded him softly.  &quot;Even
ones that must be kept from friends and family.&quot;  She paused for a moment
before she gave him a faintly coy smile.  &quot;You remember when &#39;I&#39;d tell you but
I&#39;d have to kill you&#39; used to be a joke between friends?&quot; she said demurely.
     &quot;Times change, T&#39;Del,&quot; the Dragoon said somberly.  &quot;We&#39;re not children
anymore.&quot;
     &quot;Believe me, I know,&quot; the redhead replied with a soft sigh.  She studied
the look in his gray eyes for a number of moments before she sighed again and
glanced away, absently studying the contents of the room.
     &quot;You haven&#39;t answered my original question, you know,&quot; Tolaris pointed out
in a quiet tone, drawing her intense gaze back to him.  &quot;About the real reason
you&#39;re here.  And I think you know what I mean,&quot; he added.
     T&#39;Del looked at him carefully before sighing very softly to herself.  &quot;Am
I not allowed to seek the company of a childhood friend without having motives
ascribed to me?&quot; she asked in a soft voice.
     &quot;Ideally, no,&quot; Tolaris replied.  &quot;But when has it ever worked that way?&quot;
     &quot;The&#39;lon,&quot; she breathed with a very hollow laugh, her voice barely audible
as she said a word traditionally used to acknowledge a round-winning point in
a p&#39;sa&#39;na tournament.  She studied the carpet for a moment before looking back
up at him.  &quot;So what are you going to do now?&quot; she inquired.
     Tolaris paused and regarded her carefully.  &quot;Who&#39;s asking?&quot; he countered.
&quot;You or whomever it is you really work for these days?&quot;
     The slightest hint of a smile brushed the edges of her lips as she leaned
back a few inches.  &quot;I am asking, Tolaris,&quot; she replied softly.  &quot;Since the
failure of our communications unit two days ago, I haven&#39;t been in a position
to receive any new instructions.  Not that I mind,&quot; she admitted with a faint
shrug of dismissal.  &quot;The silence is welcome, which is not to suggest that I am
constantly distracted from my maintenance duties, but at the same time I am
more than a little distressed to be.... out of the loop, as it were, during a
rather unwelcome turn of events in global affairs.&quot;
     Tolaris grunted quietly as he was reminded of yesterday&#39;s events.  &quot;You
mean the nuclear missile strike on the Imperial Castle,&quot; he observed.
     &quot;Among other events, yes,&quot; T&#39;Del said with a slow nod.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose
you or anyone else has figured that one out yet?&quot; she asked in a hopeful tone.
     &quot;Not really,&quot; the Dragoon sighed in resignation.  &quot;I am fairly sure it was
one of Rune&#39;s less-than-elegant ideas, and that it appeared to have been aimed
at General Nop&#39;tera&#39;s flagship carrier, but the logic behind it all, if there
even is any, currently escapes us at the moment.  I&#39;m sure it will all become
sorted out and explained to the public soon enough.&quot;
     T&#39;Del nodded slowly.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you
will tell me how and why you became swept up in this?  Last I heard, you were
judged a traitor, entombed in Eternal Crystal, and subsequently.... departed,&quot;
she breathed, suggesting that she had feared the worst.
     It took Tolaris a few moments to decide how exactly to respond.  &quot;Let&#39;s
just say that I was in the area when things got problematic.  Being a Dragoon,
I was naturally concerned for the welfare of my former command and stuck around
to help as best as I could.&quot;
     &quot;I see,&quot; the redhead said studiously.  &quot;Are you still with the Legion,
then, or have you moved on to a somewhat private career?&quot; she inquired.
     &quot;Would you believe that I am officially listed as being on administrative
leave?&quot; he said lightly, prompting a surprised blink from her.  &quot;I&#39;m relieved
of command, of course, but it just might be plausible that I could return to
active and uniformed duty as a Dragoon.&quot;
     &quot;I see you have the uniform aspect taken care of already,&quot; she pointed
out as she let her gaze wander along the lines of his dark blue uniform.  &quot;If
I didn&#39;t know better, however, I&#39;d say that you&#39;ve put on a little weight.&quot;
     Tolaris grumbled very quietly to himself as he felt his cheeks take on a
dark gray hue.  &quot;Life on Earth has been good to me,&quot; he sighed.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; T&#39;Del said, her vibrant green eyes widening slightly as she sat up
straight.  &quot;Was that Queen Beryl&#39;s doing, then, or something else?&quot;
     Tolaris paused for several moments to regard her carefully.  &quot;T&#39;Del, just
how long have you been out in the middle of nowhere like this?&quot; he finally said
with a faint hint of reproach to his tone.  &quot;Granted I wouldn&#39;t expect many of
the details of my exile to have been publicly advertised, but surely you&#39;ve
heard *something* about what happened and why.&quot;
     T&#39;Del gave him a level look before sighing quietly and glancing away.  &quot;I
will admit to not having paid attention to minute trivia as I.... as we used
to,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;As I said, after word came of your so-called trial for
treason and I managed to research what was recorded of it, I truly had no real
reason to believe I would ever see you again.  I sort of lost the desire to
keep myself.... immersed, if you will, in the intricacies of politics and all
that their webs encompassed.  After all,&quot; she said as she turned back to look
at him, &quot;What was the use in trying to keep up with you if you were no longer
around to do so?  Don&#39;t get me wrong, I still paid attention to the newsfeeds
about events of importance, but only as far as the next denizen would.  I sense
I have said something that bothers you,&quot; she added with a slight frown as she
noticed the change in his expression.
     &quot;I think, when this is over, I need to see a Healer for a physical,&quot; he
finally said as his side quit hurting.  He gingerly massaged his ribcage where
his heart muscle was before sighing heavily and looking up at her.  &quot;I&#39;m fairly
sure I had a minor heart-attack on Earth several months ago, and it seems I&#39;ve
got this lingering twinge that flares up when something genuinely shocks me.
The funny thing is, every heart-scan I&#39;ve had says I&#39;m fine, and believe me
when I say that I&#39;ve been scanned quite often.&quot;
     &quot;Tolaris,&quot; T&#39;Del said with a dark scowl, &quot;You&#39;re only seven hundred, you
shouldn&#39;t be having any kind of cardiological problems.  Bear in mind that it
might not be with the heart itself, but with another part of your body that can
result in excessive stress on the muscles or surrounding tissue.  Now be that
as it may, what did I say that was sufficiently disturbing to remind you of
your medical concerns?&quot;
     &quot;The part where you said you were trying to keep up with me,&quot; Tolaris said
with open wryness.  &quot;I always felt like I had to work hard just to keep up with
you, and even then I didn&#39;t often feel like I had managed to do any more than
simply break even.&quot;
     T&#39;Del tilted her head at an angle and regarded him carefully.  &quot;Even when
we were children?&quot; she prodded in an odd tone.
     &quot;Especially then,&quot; Tolaris replied with a soft sigh.  &quot;Granted it became
easier once I went into the Intelligence field, but by that time.... well, you
had your career going and while finding you was easy, trying to talk to you was
not.  But then again, that&#39;s expected when you try to compete with a good fifth
of the planetary population for the attentions of a celebrity.&quot;
     &quot;Celebrity,&quot; T&#39;Del grumbled, her countenance darkening as she hugged her
knees to her chest.  &quot;That was a bit of a mistake, to be honest.  Yes, I know
it is a statement of fact to say that I rank in the top one-percent of women of
whom the global population agrees are the most physically attractive according
to the vast majority of standards regarding female beauty.  The accolades were
quite nice at the time, especially for the ego, and I will readily admit that
I savored some of the.... benefits, if you will, of the position, but I became
utterly and completely bored with it after a century.  There was virtually no
mental stimulation to speak of, which is why I finally chose a different path.&quot;
     Tolaris nodded to himself.  &quot;Back to the N&#39;Then&#39;an Academy of Arts and
Sciences for your degree in Applied Nuclear Fusion.  A third-level degree,&quot; he
added with a faint emphasis.  &quot;Shortly followed by enlistment into the military
and a position in the Engineering division after turning down an offer for an
Imperial Commission.&quot;
     The redhead shrugged absently to herself.  &quot;The media tends to leave you
alone once you leave the civilian life,&quot; she said demurely.  &quot;That, and after
what I had gone through in the proverbial spotlight, I had little desire to be
a leader of others.  I guess you could say I needed the motivation to grow up
just a little more,&quot; she added with a faint sigh.
     &quot;Any regrets?&quot; Tolaris prodded softly.
     &quot;No, not really,&quot; T&#39;Del said without hesitation, shaking her head just
slightly.  &quot;I&#39;ll be honest, the pay was.... less than ideal, but then again I
didn&#39;t choose this path for the monetary compensation.  I have, with very few
exceptions, all that I want in life.  I have never been a greedy woman, and so
I do not possess many material things valued for their physical worth.  My job
keeps me sufficiently busy that I am not bored, yet doesn&#39;t leave me feeling
overworked at the end of the day.  My abilities are not taxed heavily, but
often various challenges will arise that keeps me quite engaged in the overall
situation and sometimes even results in a new technique being used that I had
not previously contemplated before.&quot;
     &quot;I can see how that might appeal to you,&quot; Tolaris allowed with what might
have been a ghost of a smile on his lips.
     &quot;It does,&quot; T&#39;Del confirmed with a slight nod of her head.  &quot;I will admit
in private that I sometimes am.... less-than-impressed with my co-workers and
their abilities, but I have to often stop to wonder if that is due to a genuine
deficiency on their part or if it is merely arrogance and ego on my part.  The
current team I am on, Sector Seven, is of course no exception, but I have to
confess to being far more at ease with their company than with teams and groups
I have had to work with in the past.&quot;
     &quot;So what are the accommodations like?&quot; Tolaris inquired out of genuine
curiosity.  &quot;I would imagine that an isolated and somewhat desolate facility
such as a desert repair bay would not exactly be excessively above your basic
barracks-level standards.&quot;
     &quot;Barracks is a good word,&quot; T&#39;Del replied with a soft sigh.  &quot;Two to an
admittedly spacious room with a common open-bay shower.  Given the amount of
dirt, sand, grease, and other substances in which we routinely find ourselves
covered in, however, the open-bay shower is rather efficient in terms of being
able to keep the walls and floor sufficiently clean.  Of course, being an all-
female unit is also a positive, as that means the bathrooms don&#39;t need nearly
as much cleaning and maintenance as an all-male or mixed-gender unit might.
Would you please enlighten me as to how men can possess an aimable appendage
for the admittedly secondary but still biologically-valid purpose of liquid
waste disposal, and yet routinely fail to ensure that everything arrives in the
proper receptacle in its entirety?&quot; she mused with a fairly wicked twinkle in
her eyes.
     &quot;Things sometimes stick,&quot; he managed to say with a straight face despite
the fact that his face was now a solid gray color.  &quot;That tends to spoil your
aim at first, and unless you&#39;re awake enough to pay close enough attention you
might not even realize something is amiss.  Such as it were,&quot; he added after
the accidental pun hit him.
     Instead of being amused, T&#39;Del tilted her head steeply and seemed to be
giving it genuine thought.  &quot;Indeed,&quot; she said after a few moments of studious
silence.  &quot;When explained like that, it has a measure of plausibility to it.&quot;
     &quot;I should hope so,&quot; Tolaris replied dryly.  &quot;Show me a male who hasn&#39;t
pissed on his foot by accident at least once in his life because things went in
a different direction than was intended and I will show you a male who is still
in diapers.&quot;
     As expected, T&#39;Del immediately erupted into laughter at the mental image,
tipping over onto her side after a few seconds to end up in a ball on the lower
half of the bed.  The sound of her laughter and the way she was holding her
knees against her shapely chest were distinctly familiar, quietly bringing back
more than a few ghostly echoes of his childhood and the times they had spent
together as somewhat-close friends.
     &quot;Now that I can believe,&quot; she said in a slightly breathless tone once she
quit laughing and sat back up straight.  She continued to chuckle quietly to
herself before she seemed to sober up slightly.  &quot;Tolaris.... just how long has
it been since we spoke like this?&quot;
     Tolaris glanced at her for a brief instant before looking away, silently
digging through the rest of his memories.  &quot;Before Mintaka,&quot; he finally said in
a subdued tone.  &quot;Things were.... fairly chaotic after that for several years,
trying to figure out who was still alive and who wasn&#39;t.  I didn&#39;t think you
had been directly in combat like I was, but I know more than a few Engineering
units that had been completely wiped out.  They started the screening process
for Lieutenant-Commander about twenty years after the dust settled, and as it
turns out the fact that I knew you put a minor flag in my file.  They did some
minor digging, asked a few questions about our relationship and past, and at
some point casually mentioned that you were still alive and well.  I asked if
they knew how to get in touch with you and they made it quite clear that it
wasn&#39;t in my best interests anymore to do so.&quot;
     &quot;Ah,&quot; T&#39;Del said very quietly.  &quot;So he did do that after all.&quot;  She paused
as she caught his questioning look and sighed softly to herself.  &quot;Let&#39;s just
say that a few procedural changes were implemented in the wave of paranoia and
distrust following the Mintaka Campaign, and at the time I.... well, for all
intents and practical purposes, I didn&#39;t officially exist for a good thirty
years.  I finally told them to let me out for air or lose my services.  They
chose to let me out for air,&quot; she added in an attempt at humor.  &quot;Hence my
current official career as a mechanic.&quot;
     &quot;Your files, or at least the ones I knew to exist, were shortly sealed and
buried under six types of classification and two levels of encryption,&quot; Tolaris
said quietly.  &quot;Needless to say, I lost track of you.  I might have been able
to find you if I was truly determined enough and was willing to risk breaking
a few rules....&quot;
     &quot;But?&quot; T&#39;Del said in a near-whisper as the Dragoon trailed off.
     &quot;But I kept thinking,&quot; Tolaris replied as he closed his eyes.  &quot;I kept
thinking, she knows where I&#39;m at, she knows what I&#39;m doing, she knows how easy
it would be to get in touch with me.  A communique, a letter, a simple service
message from a public terminal, anything to let me know how she&#39;s doing.  And
she never bothered.  A year, two years, ten years, fifty, a hundred.... all
this time passed by me, and never once did you say anything.  I figured that
you had your reasons for keeping to yourself, and so I didn&#39;t force anything.
After all, if it really wasn&#39;t &#39;in my best interests&#39; to not ask about you,
surely you would have said something, right?&quot;
     T&#39;Del remained silent as she drew her knees up to her chest again, her
vibrant green eyes half-closed as she stared down at the carpet.  &quot;Ironic,&quot; she
finally said in a faintly bitter tone.  &quot;And all this time I figured you were
simply too busy.  I tried to follow you as best I could.  First promoted to
Lieutenant-Commander, then later again to full Commander and given command of
the Dragoon Legion.  A mere six-hundred and fifty years old, and already you
had attained a division-level posting.  That would keep anyone busy.&quot;
     &quot;It did,&quot; Tolaris allowed quietly.
     &quot;Understandable,&quot; the redhead replied with a nod.  &quot;So then, now that we
finally caught up with one another.... what are you going to do now?&quot;
     A very faint grunt rose up from Tolaris&#39; chest.  &quot;Back to this question
again, is it?&quot; he said, trying to keep his voice free from any hint of emotion.
     &quot;Tolaris, please,&quot; T&#39;Del whispered quietly as she dropped her legs to the
floor and rested her elbows on her knees.  She glanced up at him before sighing
to herself and slowly running her fingers through her mane of flaming-red hair.
     &quot;Perhaps I should ask you what you&#39;re going to do now,&quot; Tolaris said as he
leaned back in his chair, studying her carefully.
     She paused in mid-motion and glanced up at him.  &quot;In regards to...?&quot; she
prodded in a curious tone.  She raised an eyebrow at him as he made a gesture
of idle dismissal and sat up straight.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she said in a faintly cool
tone.  &quot;This evening I and my co-workers will be heading over to Sector One for
casual recreation.  No doubt that my crew chief will be patronizing the bar&#39;s
selection of alcohol, while I personally am scheduled to be performing as part
of the entertainment.&quot;
     That caused Tolaris to sit up straight and blink hard in surprise.  &quot;Yeah,
that was mentioned to me earlier today,&quot; he said in an openly uneasy tone.  &quot;I
don&#39;t suppose you would care to clarify a few details for me on the nature of
this.... entertainment venue of yours?&quot;
     &quot;Such as?&quot; she prompted with a faint hint of a smile on her lips.  &quot;Surely
you don&#39;t need anyone to explain to you what a stripper does while on stage.&quot;
     &quot;T&#39;Del....&quot; Tolaris started to whisper before his voice failed him.
     T&#39;Del stood up and very slowly began to pace around the room, the sound of
her boots almost completely muffled by the carpeting.  &quot;I don&#39;t care what they
think, Tolaris,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;If they look at me and see something cheap
or tawdry, that is their concern.  I know what I am, and those who work with me
likewise know what I am.  To me, it is art, an expression of the living grace
and beauty of the female denizen form.  When I am on stage, I am not doing it
for them.  If I wanted their accolades, I would have remained a fashion model
for the masses.  When I stand in the light, it is all for me.  I know what I
am, and I don&#39;t need anyone to tell me that I&#39;m pretty or beautiful on the
outside.  I already know that.  But on the inside....&quot;
     She suddenly quit pacing around the room and turned to look at him.  &quot;When
I stand up there, I can feel how warm the light is on bare skin.  Not warmth
like standing in sunlight, but the warmth of artistic expression.  You have no
idea how.... how free it feels, how liberating, to dance like that.  There is
literally nothing between me and the warmth of that light, of the attention of
the crowd.  Yes, I mostly see lust and greed when I look at them, but I also
see appreciation and approval.  Not because I am naked, but because they can
see the art in what I do and like what they see.&quot;
     Tolaris nodded slowly to her.  &quot;Believe it or not, T&#39;Del, I can and do
understand,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;The first time is always the worst, having to
gather the courage to be so daring, so defiant, but afterwards, once you are
comfortable not with just yourself but with the sensations it brings....&quot;
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; T&#39;Del said very carefully, tilting her head to study him with
enough intensity to make him shiver slightly.  &quot;How have you of all people come
to know this?  Not that you are wrong, far from it, but never would I have even
considered that you would be the type of man....&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Tolaris interrupted gently.  &quot;I only know this because it was
explained to me by.... one who is a dancer in her heart.&quot;
     &quot;And who is she?&quot; T&#39;Del asked, her voice barely more than a whisper.
     &quot;No-one you&#39;ve met,&quot; he said gently.
     &quot;Humor me,&quot; she pleaded quietly.
     He looked at her before sighing softly to himself, suddenly feeling every
bit as old as he really was.  &quot;Sailor Mercury,&quot; he said before his voice quit
working properly.  As he expected, T&#39;Del became perfectly still as her mind
briefly went into overdrive to process the information, narrowing her mental
focus so intently that she quite literally forgot to breathe for a number of
seconds.
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; she finally said once she slipped back out of what he had come
to privately think of as &#39;super-computer mode&#39; and started to breathe again.
&quot;When that incident happened last year.... did you, in fact, betray us to the
Sailor Scouts?&quot; she asked, her voice unusually hesitant as she looked up at him
with open unease.
     &quot;What I did,&quot; Tolaris managed to say in a fairly level tone despite the
sudden anxiety attack that was gripping him, &quot;Was refuse to follow what I felt
was an unconscionable order to kill three humans whose sole crime was to take
up arms to defend their world against an unprovoked aggression on our part.  I
will admit to letting my emotions taint my perception of events, but even in
retrospect I am still convinced my actions were right and just.&quot;
     &quot;Go on,&quot; T&#39;Del said softly.
     &quot;I.... I had them,&quot; Tolaris said, his voice starting to rasp in his throat
as the memories came back.  &quot;I had both Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask securely
trapped in energy-draining crystal matrices.  All that was left was.... was
Sailor Mercury, and.... I just couldn&#39;t do it.  T&#39;Del.... I knew who she was,
we had met when I first arrived on Earth, she helped me, we became friends and
I found myself....&quot;
     He closed his eyes as he felt her touch on his wrist, squeezing him gently
in a gesture of support and comfort.  &quot;I fell in love with her,&quot; he rasped very
quietly, the words spilling forth in a torrent of emotion.  &quot;Not even an hour
before I was holding her in the gazebo, and then Serena joined us, and not even
three minutes later I&#39;m watching them both transform and realizing that they
were the ones I was sent to observe and kill....&quot;
     &quot;Kill?&quot; T&#39;Del echoed in a neutral tone.  &quot;Or merely capture?&quot;
     &quot;Please,&quot; the Dragoon said bitterly as he absently tugged his wrist free
from her gentle grasp.  &quot;I knew what would have happened to them had I brought
them back into the Negaverse alive.&quot;
     &quot;And you couldn&#39;t allow that to happen to your.... lover?&quot; T&#39;Del suggested
in a very curious tone.  She paused and blinked at the look her words drew from
her childhood friend, wondering if she had misread something.
     &quot;We weren&#39;t lovers,&quot; Tolaris said in a faintly edged tone.  He looked at
the redhead for a moment and sighed softly before staring down at the carpet.
&quot;At least, not at the time,&quot; he added in an almost inaudible voice.  &quot;Ami was
unlike anyone I had ever met before, and the strength of the emotions that she
drew from me, and had for me, was.... frightening.  And irresistible.&quot;
     He fell silent as he felt her touch along his jaw, very gently tilting his
head up so that their eyes could meet.  A very dark shiver ran down his spine
at the intensity of her piercing gaze, seeming to study every minute detail of
his face before she slowly nodded to herself in understanding.  It was not the
first time she had gazed into his eyes in order to gain an understanding of how
or what he was thinking.  He had once asked as a joke if she was trying to read
his mind through his optic nerves, only to be answered with a very coy smile
and a very cryptic answer that he still didn&#39;t understand to this day.
     &quot;As always, Tolaris,&quot; she finally said in a soft voice, &quot;You continue to
surprise me.  Don&#39;t misunderstand,&quot; she added quickly as he blinked.  &quot;I don&#39;t
think I could bring myself to act against my.... intended life-mate either, so
regardless of the actual truth of the matter, you will not find me among those
who would condemn you for your actions.  You.... do intend to take her as your
life-mate, correct?  A human girl, even if she is a Sailor Scout?&quot; she inquired
in an almost nervous voice.
     Tolaris might have smiled if he didn&#39;t sense an undercurrent of unease to
her question.  &quot;With all that she and I have been through together, with all
the feelings we have for one another that even today still sometimes take me by
surprise with its intensity, it would be almost unimaginable if I didn&#39;t,&quot; he
said gently.  He paused as he studied the emotions reflected in her green eyes
and suddenly got the distinct impression that he was missing something.  &quot;Why
are you smiling at me like that?&quot; he inquired cautiously.
     T&#39;Del simply shook her head and edged away from him, gingerly sitting back
down on the corner of the bed.  &quot;I always wondered how long it would be before
you took a lover,&quot; she mused in an odd tone.  &quot;For awhile I was starting to
wonder if you even found women attractive.&quot;
     &quot;You seriously doubted that?&quot; Tolaris said in a very dubious tone.
     &quot;Well, sort of,&quot; T&#39;Del admitted with a faintly embarrassed shrug of her
shoulders and a sheepish smile.  &quot;You never.... well, you never paid attention
to me like that.  Don&#39;t give me that look,&quot; she sighed as he leaned forward to
rest his elbows on his knees and put his chin in his hands.
     &quot;You were one of my best friends,&quot; Tolaris pointed out as his guts turned
into a solid ball of lead.  &quot;In some ways, my only friend.  Yes, you were the
most beautiful girl in the region, but let&#39;s be honest, you didn&#39;t act like one
and certainly didn&#39;t show even the slightest interest in dating anyone.&quot;
     Another embarrassed smile crossed T&#39;Del&#39;s face as she edged back and drew
her knees up to her chest, hugging them gently.  &quot;Okay, yes, I was more than a
bit of a tomboy,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;And you&#39;re right, very few people interested
me like that.  At the time,&quot; she added.  &quot;Like I said, I guess I just needed a
little extra time to truly grow up.&quot;  She paused to glance up at the expression
on his face and sighed quietly.  &quot;I should quit talking before you throw up,&quot;
she muttered.
     &quot;Just keep going,&quot; Tolaris said in a somewhat flat tone.
     &quot;Very well,&quot; the redhead murmured as she stared back down at the carpet.
&quot;What can I say, Tolaris?  By the time I realized I missed being with you, we
had already gone our separate ways.  Whenever we did talk, I always got the
feeling that you were busy and that you were just humoring an old friend.  I
sometimes think that if we had managed to stay in contact a little better....
well.... maybe things between you and I would be slightly different now.&quot;
     &quot;In what sense?&quot; Tolaris found himself asking in a hollow tone.
     A very soft and dry laugh rose up from her chest.  &quot;Well, you might not
have had to look to another world to find a lover or potential life-mate,&quot; she
admitted, her cheeks suddenly flushing a very fetching shade of red.  She very
carefully glanced up at him, only to blink hard and bolt upright in shock at
the look of pain crossing his face.  &quot;Tolaris!&quot;
     &quot;Wait for it,&quot; he grumbled quietly as he clutched his ribcage, willing the
sharp stabbing pain to go away.  It finally faded after a few seconds, leaving
him feeling more than a little drained of strength and energy.  &quot;Yeah, I think
it&#39;s time to make a very quiet and unobtrusive appointment to see a Healer.
You know, T&#39;Del, you could have said something to me somewhere along the line
about what you were feeling,&quot; he said, giving her a disgruntled look.
     She sighed and hugged her knees tighter against her chest.  &quot;Like I said,
it just seemed like you were busy all the time and I really didn&#39;t want to be
in your way or anything.  And after we lost touch after Mintaka....&quot;
     An uneasy silence descended around them as they both briefly withdrew to
deal with their own introspective thoughts.  Such stretches of silence between
them had not been uncommon in the past, tending to crop up after or sometimes
even during one of their more speculative conversations about what the future
would be like or intellectual debates of philosophy.  However, this time the
pause carried with it an undercurrent of emotion and the realization of the
tension between them was not lost on either of them.
     &quot;Tolaris,&quot; T&#39;Del finally said after an unknown lapse of time, &quot;Can we
still be friends, even after all this?&quot;
     The question seemed to catch Tolaris completely off-guard.  &quot;What?&quot; he
said before he could get his thoughts back in order.  &quot;I.... don&#39;t see any real
reason why not,&quot; he said slowly.  &quot;Granted we haven&#39;t talked to one another in
a good three centuries, but I don&#39;t think too much has changed.... right?&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;ve changed,&quot; she pointed out quietly.
     &quot;As have you,&quot; he reminded her gently.  &quot;Everyone changes after time, you
know that.  I will admit my views of our world have.... not so much changed as
been adjusted by the time I spent on Earth and living among the humans, but the
Negaverse is still my home and all.  Even if most other denizens now view me as
a traitor and pariah,&quot; he added with a distinct note of irony.
     T&#39;Del simply shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;That can be changed in time,&quot; she
said absently as she briefly slipped back into contemplative thought.  A quiet
reminder drifted up from the depths of her mind, causing her to lift her head
back up to look at him.  &quot;You.... are coming along with Commander K&#39;tal to the
tavern in Sector One tonight, right?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     The reminder was enough to provoke another twinge from the spot where his
heart was located.  &quot;To watch you.... perform?&quot; he replied in an uneasy tone.
     &quot;Among other things, yes,&quot; she said as a faint smile brushed the corners
of her lips.  &quot;Honestly, Tolaris, look me in the eye and tell me that you&#39;ve
never wanted to see me naked before....&quot;
     The soft smile on her face widened slightly as Tolaris sighed heavily and
stared down at the floor, his face flushing a dark shade of gray.  &quot;Not in that
way, T&#39;Del,&quot; he murmured as his cheeks continued to darken.  &quot;And certainly not
with an audience around.&quot;
     He looked up at her as he felt her touch on his face once again, gently
twisting his head around until their eyes met.  &quot;I would appreciate it if you
could be there tonight,&quot; she said softly, her piercing green eyes seeming to
bore through his very soul.  A faint twinkle of amusement seemed to briefly
flash across her face before she added, &quot;But if you don&#39;t think your heart can
handle it, I&#39;ll understand.  And yes, you do need to have that looked at,&quot; she
added in all seriousness as she dropped her hand and sat back, still studying
him intently.
     &quot;I will,&quot; he promised her quietly.  He gazed back at her before sighing
softly, feeling his guts tie itself into yet another knot.  &quot;And yes, I&#39;ll try
to be there tonight, barring another reactor emergency or problem.&quot;
     She nodded in understanding and stood up.  &quot;A perfectly justifiable reason
as any,&quot; she said with a soft smile.  She seemed to study him for a moment
before she bent over to give his cheek a quick kiss.  &quot;It is good to see you
again, T&#39;Laris,&quot; she murmured very softly.
     &quot;We&#39;re not children anymore, T&#39;Del,&quot; he said in a faintly edged tone.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; the redhead apologized.  She blinked as there was a rather heavy
knock at the door, causing her to cast a reflexive glance at it before looking
back down at Tolaris with a curious look.
     &quot;Enter,&quot; the Dragoon called out, giving her a helpless shrug in response.
     The door slid open to admit Maze into the room, the purple-haired Dragoon
seeming to be vastly amused by something.  The look on his face quickly changed
as he realized that Tolaris had company, causing him to abruptly halt.  &quot;Oh,&quot;
he said before clearing his throat.  &quot;Sorry to bother you, Commander....&quot;
     &quot;At ease, Maze,&quot; Tolaris said with a quiet sigh.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Maze said, giving T&#39;Del a respectful nod of his head.
     &quot;Lieutenant,&quot; T&#39;Del replied with a faint smile.  &quot;Forgive me, but you are,
I presume, the same individual that Tolaris told me about in the past?  I seem
to recall a rather interesting story being told about the trouble the two of
you got into together one midsummer evening....&quot;
     &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; Maze said, giving her a startled look.  He paused and cast a very
uneasy look at Tolaris as the elder Dragoon sighed heavily and put his face in
his hands, clearly able to see the dark gray color taking up residence in his
cheeks.
     &quot;Was is necessary to remind me of that?&quot; Tolaris asked in a muted tone.
     &quot;Of course,&quot; T&#39;Del said demurely.  &quot;What else are friends for?  As I seem
to have taken up more of your time than I had intended, I shall have to ask for
a continuance later.  Unless you still need a fusion specialist for further
engineering repairs....&quot; she added, giving Maze a questioning look.
     &quot;No, ma&#39;am, we already took care of the coolant conduit,&quot; Maze assured her
with a neutral expression.  &quot;I just came here to remind Commander Tolaris that
he needs to set the paperwork aside for a few minutes and eat something.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re right, you haven&#39;t changed much,&quot; T&#39;Del said to Tolaris with a coy
smile.  &quot;I will speak with you later, Commander, and thank you for your time.
Lieutenant,&quot; she added to Maze as she made her way over to the door.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Maze replied in a respectful tone as he stepped to the side to
let her pass.  He waited until the door closed behind her before letting out
his breath and turning to stare at Tolaris.  &quot;That.... was T&#39;Del, wasn&#39;t it?&quot;
he said in awe, absently jerking a thumb over his shoulder.  &quot;You know, the
supermodel?&quot;
     &quot;As you were, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris sighed quietly.
     &quot;What in the name of the NegaForce is she doing here?&quot; Maze demanded, his
tan eyes dangerously wide.
     &quot;She had a few questions for me,&quot; Tolaris replied, giving him a mild look.
&quot;And might I remind you that she is a very competent fusion specialist who is
assigned to duty in Sector Seven?&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re hiding something,&quot; Maze pointed out in a wary tone.  &quot;C&#39;mon, boss,
with as long as we&#39;ve known one another?  And what was that she said earlier
about hearing stories about us getting into trouble, anyway?&quot; he prodded.
     Tolaris resisted the urge to either roll his eyes or bang his head against
the nearest wall.  &quot;T&#39;Del and I are friends,&quot; he explained carefully.  &quot;What
she was referring to was the little incident you and I went through shortly
after we met in Asleen.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Maze gasped as his jaw fell open.  &quot;You said you weren&#39;t going to
tell anyone about that!&quot; he protested as he flushed green at the memory.
     &quot;You remember how I got you out of that prison cell, right?&quot; Tolaris said
in a low tone.  &quot;The only reason they didn&#39;t haul me in for questioning was I
was able to have a friend fusion-weld the bars back into place so it wouldn&#39;t
be obvious that they had been removed in the first place.  The price I had to
pay for her services was telling her how and why I had removed them to begin
with,&quot; he added in a rueful tone.
     &quot;You mean that she...?&quot; Maze said, still in a mild state of shock.
     &quot;Pure luck that our paths crossed that day,&quot; Tolaris admitted.  &quot;She was
en-route to a field assignment with her college classmates and they happened to
have stopped at that trading village for dinner.  Needless to say, we didn&#39;t
get to spend much time talking as her transport was on a schedule and I....
well, you know what happened after that,&quot; he explained, his own cheeks turning
dark gray yet again at the memory.
     &quot;Christ on a crutch,&quot; Maze breathed, clearly borrowing one of Mina&#39;s more
colorful expressions.
     &quot;Now that we&#39;re both suitably embarrassed about forgotten history, would
you mind telling me why you&#39;re here?&quot; Tolaris inquired, acutely aware of the
raging blushes still plaguing both their faces.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Maze said in slight confusion before his mind cleared.  &quot;Oh, yes.
I wasn&#39;t kidding when I said I came here to kick you in the ptanka about not
eating lunch.  K&#39;tal would have sent Asrial to do it, but I felt that you might
not have wanted to be patching claw holes in something, so I said I&#39;d go get
your attention.  Oh, and the good Commander said I had fifteen minutes to get
you into the chow hall before he sent Asrial after the both of us.&quot;
     Tolaris grunted quietly to himself at the mental images that sprang to
mind.  &quot;Alright, let&#39;s go,&quot; he sighed.
     &quot;Wow, that didn&#39;t take long,&quot; Maze chuckled as Tolaris rose to his feet.
&quot;And here I thought I&#39;d have to toss a few kinetic darts at you to get you to
put the paperwork down.  Or whatever it was you were working on,&quot; he added as
he cast a discreet glance at the computer monitor.
     &quot;Paperwork,&quot; Tolaris grumbled as he reached out to type in a quick command
on the terminal.  The display went idle a few moments later, erasing whatever
electronic data had been written to it.
     &quot;Anything worthwhile?&quot; Maze prodded carefully.
     &quot;Not anymore, Maze,&quot; Tolaris said absently as he briefly thought of the
odd smile on T&#39;Del&#39;s face he had seen only moments ago.  &quot;Not anymore....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Damn,&quot; Leda sighed quietly as she roughly leaned her shoulder against the
oak tree.  &quot;I thought that class would never end.  What is it about school on
a Monday that makes it suck so much?&quot; she complained to Rei.
     Rei just looked at her before shaking her head to herself.  &quot;Psychology,&quot;
she muttered as she kept a casual eye on the horde of students heading towards
the buses and the waiting cars of parents.  The feelings of unease had largely
left after her brief conversation with Serena, but the wave of dark energy that
had swept through her less than an hour ago was a different matter entirely.
She figured that she could probably tune out the empathic vibes she was picking
up from the long-haired blonde if she tried hard enough, but she also knew that
there was simply no way that Serena&#39;s half-denizen side could have been the
source of the very distinct and familiar chill now plaguing her.
     &quot;I suppose that&#39;s a good sign, then,&quot; Leda groused as she too started to
survey her surroundings.
     Rei paused and cast a leery glance towards the brunette.  &quot;How so?&quot; she
prodded in a perfectly neutral tone.
     Leda glanced over at her before shrugging.  &quot;It means I&#39;ve got a mind to
mess with, contrary to what some people have said lately,&quot; she pointed out.
     The priestess just rolled her eyes and went back to scanning the crowd, a
slight frown crossing her face as she could see Mina chatting away with a girl
with unusually pale hair.  &quot;Great,&quot; she muttered sourly, knowing that if the
chaotic blonde&#39;s mood held for another few minutes, she would wind up being a
chatterbox for a good portion of the rest of the day.  Normally that wouldn&#39;t
grate too heavily on her nerves, especially when Ami was around to occasionally
prod Mina into toning it down so as not to be a distraction, but Leda had a
point about Mondays seeming to take a heavier-than-usual toll on everyone&#39;s
tolerance and patience.
     &quot;Find something?&quot; Leda asked in a low tone as she cast a glance over her
shoulder to try to see what Rei was looking at.
     &quot;Just the motor-mouth,&quot; Rei said sourly.
     &quot;Which one?&quot; Leda inquired with a smirk, prompting a soft grunt from Rei.
&quot;You need to settle down, pyro.  Yeah, I know, it&#39;s Monday and all, but.... oh,
you mean Mina this time, eh?  Bah, you know how she is when she makes a new
friend,&quot; she sighed in resignation.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised she hasn&#39;t talked Lily&#39;s
ears off yet.&quot;
     &quot;The pale girl?&quot; Rei said absently as she narrowed her eyes.  The ghostly
feeling of unease was starting to return once again, very gently raising the
hair on the back of her neck.  &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen her before.  She&#39;s
new here, right?&quot;
     &quot;Foreign exchange student,&quot; the brunette replied.  &quot;Met her this morning.
A bit quiet and shy, but she&#39;s still fairly cute.  Mina latched onto her right
away and I don&#39;t think she&#39;s shut up since.&quot;
     &quot;You mean Lily?&quot; a voice said very softly, causing both Leda and Rei to
nearly hit the tree branches hanging above them.  Rei immediately spun around
to find Ami quietly standing behind them, hugging her textbooks against her
chest in an unconsciously protective gesture.  The hasty movement whipped Rei&#39;s
mane of raven-black hair around, causing Ami to take a quick hop to the side
to avoid having the dark strands lash across her face.
     &quot;Jesus Christ, Ami,&quot; Leda growled as she leaned forward to rest one hand
on her thigh and used the other to massage her chest.  &quot;How many times to I
have to say this?  Quit sneaking up on us like some goddamned ninja, okay?
Damn....&quot;
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami apologized quietly, casting a very nervous glance towards the
street where she had seen Jedyt earlier.
     &quot;You felt it too?&quot; Rei asked carefully as she realized that Ami was quite
obviously uneasy about something.
     &quot;Jedyt was here,&quot; Ami replied, causing the priestess to blink hard.  &quot;He
saw Serena and I when we were out playing volleyball in gym class.  He knows
where we go to school now,&quot; she said, closing her eyes and shivering lightly.
     &quot;Huh?&quot; Leda said, pausing as she saw the dark look forming on Rei&#39;s face.
&quot;Back up for a moment.  Jedyt is that dipwad we met over at the temple, right?
Right before Serena.... well, anyway,&quot; she said, deciding it was best not to
remind them any more than was necessary about the weekend&#39;s events.
     Rei simply nodded solemnly as she cast another glance towards Mina.  Her
expression darkened by another degree as she noticed that Serena had joined the
group, both blondes holding a rather animated conversation with the pale-haired
girl.  An inaudible snarl started to rise up from her throat as the feeling of
ghostly unease started to become worse, as if a part of her subconscious mind
was trying to warn her of something.
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; Ami said in a very subdued tone.  &quot;That&#39;s him.&quot;
     &quot;Ami, are you alright?&quot; Leda inquired carefully.  &quot;You look like you&#39;re
ready to crawl under a rock or something.&quot;
     &quot;The three of us had to deal with Jedyt for several weeks on our own, long
before you came along,&quot; Rei spoke up, her voice sounding faintly distracted.
&quot;It was not a pleasant experience and it left a few scars we would rather not
talk about.  Let&#39;s just say he&#39;s a mean one and leave it at that.  We thought
we had killed him at the airport, but obviously not.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, what do you mean by scars?&quot; Leda spoke up, giving Ami an uneasy
look.  &quot;I thought you said you just picked up the usual cuts and bruises from
dealing with the Negaverse.&quot;
     &quot;Psychological ones,&quot; Rei spoke up before Ami could.  &quot;We weren&#39;t used to
dealing with the horrors of the Negaverse at the time.  It&#39;s no different than
what you kept bitching about when we had to deal with Zoicite and her antics.&quot;
     Both Ami and Rei blinked hard as Leda made a very dangerous growling noise
to herself, her expression immediately twisting into one of pure loathing.  &quot;I
think I know what you mean now,&quot; she grumbled, casting a truly dark look at a
particular and distant part of the city behind them.  &quot;You know, I almost wish
that flowery slut would come back, just so I can have the pleasure of....&quot;
     &quot;We get the idea, Leda,&quot; Ami said quickly as she shivered again.
     Leda glanced at her for several seconds before making a quiet huffing
noise to herself and leaning against the tree, still clearly lost in thoughts
of being able to exact her own personal brand of vengeance on the Negaverse
general.  &quot;Beryl could at least have let us kill her,&quot; she muttered darkly.
     &quot;At least she&#39;s dead,&quot; Rei pointed out, casting a sidelong look at the
simmering brunette.  &quot;That&#39;s more than we can say for Jedyt.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Leda sighed as she looked up at the sky, barely able to see the
blue color through the thick canopy of leaves overhead.  &quot;So tell me again why
nobody killed him when he dropped in on you?  Alex seemed ready to orgasm at
the thought of lopping his head off with her sword....&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Leda,&quot; Rei said sourly, prompting a soft snort of derision in
response.  &quot;Anyway, so back to the original problem.  Any idea why Jedyt was
hanging around here earlier?&quot;
     Ami hesitated before she took a deep breath.  &quot;I think he might have been
looking for something,&quot; she explained.  &quot;He had a map with him, and he didn&#39;t
seem to be too sure of where he was going.&quot;
     Rei thought about it for a moment, still absently watching the three girls
talking in the distance.  &quot;He knows where I live,&quot; she said slowly, thinking
aloud.  &quot;And he knows where Darian lives.  Or should,&quot; she added wryly.  &quot;After
that visit Zoicite paid him, I&#39;m sure everybody with a fraction of a clue can
get the information from a report or something.  They also know about us using
Nephlyte&#39;s cathedral as a base, which probably wasn&#39;t a smart move on our part
but that was Tolaris&#39; decision.&quot;
     &quot;Hey, easy,&quot; Leda said softly as Ami sighed at the mention of Tolaris.
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Ami whispered as she looked away from the group.  &quot;I&#39;m just
worried about him and the others.  Especially with that reactor coolant leak,&quot;
she added before she shuddered.
     Rei frowned as she noticed a dark and fairly expensive-looking sedan pull
up to the curb in the student pick-up zone.  The conversation between Serena,
Mina, and Lily seemed to change before the pale-haired girl gestured to the car
and seemed to indicate that it was there to pick her up.  Must be nice to be
that rich, Rei thought to herself with a faint twinge of jealousy as Lily waved
to the pair of blondes and got in the car.  The sedan promptly pulled away from
the curb and headed out towards the exit while Serena and Mina started to make
their way towards the oak tree, both blondes having identical smiles on their
faces as they continued talking.
     &quot;Relax,&quot; Leda said absently to Ami as she briefly eyed the departing car.
&quot;Dragoons aren&#39;t stupid, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve got the problem well in hand by now
and are probably kicking back with a beer or something while some low-ranking
janitor is running a mop along the floor to clean up the mess.&quot;
     Rei remained silent as she continued to think about what Jedyt could have
been looking for.  He knows the city fairly well, she thought, so it can&#39;t be
something major.  If he had an address where he thought one of us lived, he&#39;d
be out in the suburbs instead of around here.  Unless he had Leda&#39;s apartment
number, but even then he&#39;d be way over there instead of over here, and surely
he&#39;d be far more interested in where Serena lives than a Sailor Scout he never
met until....
     &quot;Until we ran into him at the temple,&quot; Rei suddenly said aloud in a muted
whisper as the puzzle pieces finally fell into place.  She paused and cast a
glance at the rest of the group as they both turned to look at her in surprise.
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Leda said, giving her an uneasy look.
     &quot;I know what he&#39;s looking for,&quot; Rei said in a neutral tone.
     &quot;Who, Jedyt?&quot; Mina said casually as she and Serena approached the group,
obviously having been able to hear what the priestess had said.  &quot;I keep trying
to get everyone to relax about him, but it&#39;s an uphill battle.  Hey, girls,&quot;
she added as an afterthought with an impish smile.
     &quot;Huh?&quot; Serena said in confusion, stopping dead in her tracks and turning
pale at the mention of Jedyt&#39;s name.  &quot;Wait, what&#39;s going on?&quot;
     &quot;I know what Jedyt was looking for earlier,&quot; Rei repeated, giving Mina a
look completely devoid of any semblance of emotion.
     A knowing smirk crossed Mina&#39;s face.  &quot;If you mean the location of the
church where I asked him to meet Sailor V at, you&#39;re probably right,&quot; she said
with a chuckle.  &quot;And yes, I completely forgot that it&#39;s not too far from here,
so I guess you can blame this one on me.&quot;
     &quot;And if he&#39;s looking for something else?&quot; Ami prodded in a wary tone.
     Mina paused for a few moments as a deeply contemplative look clouded her
face.  &quot;Well,&quot; she finally said before she shrugged and flashed a brilliant
smile at the blue-haired girl, &quot;If he&#39;s looking for something other than the
church, I guess I&#39;m just as screwed as the rest of you girls.  Oh, lighten up,
Ami,&quot; she sighed theatrically at the change in Ami&#39;s expression.  &quot;Look, will
you just sit back and trust me for once?  I really do know what I&#39;m doing when
it comes to dealing with that broken nacho.&quot;
     Ami gave Mina a very uncertain look while Serena, Rei, and Leda all traded
dubious looks at the blonde&#39;s rather unconventional descriptive term.  There
quickly followed a collective blink as the muted sound of a rumbling stomach
could be heard, prompting a dark blush from Serena.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; she apologized in a meek voice.
     &quot;Serena,&quot; Leda said in a pained voice, &quot;It&#39;s only two in the afternoon,
you can&#39;t possibly be that hungry.&quot;
     &quot;Er, well....&quot; Serena hedged as she glanced around.  &quot;Mina&#39;s the one who
start talking about nachos and all....&quot;
     &quot;Oh, god,&quot; Mina sighed as she looked up towards the sky.  &quot;Serena, what
are we going to do with you?&quot;
     &quot;I can&#39;t help it!&quot; Serena whined, giving her fellow blonde an upset look.
She sighed and gave Ami an unhappy look as she approached with her miniature
computer in hand, carefully scanning Serena&#39;s abdomen.
     &quot;Well?&quot; Leda prompted as Ami&#39;s eyebrows arched up slightly.
     &quot;It seems you have a faster metabolism now,&quot; Ami said in a studious tone.
She continued to study the data readings before sighing quietly to herself and
switching the device off, absently tucking it back into her Lunar Space pocket
for storage.  She glanced up to find a somewhat confused look on Serena&#39;s face
and had to suppress a second sigh of resignation.  &quot;It means you now digest a
lot faster than you used to,&quot; she explained.  &quot;You might want to either bring
a bigger lunch or several snacks for a light after-school meal.  And I do mean
a light one,&quot; she added with audible emphasis.
     &quot;Got any more fruit cups?&quot; Mina said to Leda in a low but amused tone.
     &quot;Are you kidding?&quot; Leda smirked as she knelt down to open up her backpack.
&quot;C&#39;mon, we&#39;ve been watching out for Serena for how long now?  Give me just a
little credit here,&quot; she smirked as she stood back up with a pair of the foil-
sealed fruit cups.
     &quot;Just one, Leda,&quot; Ami warned, giving Serena a reproving look at the way
her expression suddenly changed at the thought of being able to eat something.
     &quot;Who said they were both for her?&quot; Leda replied archly as she held one out
to Mina, catching the blonde off-guard.  &quot;This is the one I was looking for
earlier, but it had fallen to the bottom and I wasn&#39;t in the mood to go hunting
for it,&quot; she explained.
     &quot;Oooo, thank you,&quot; Mina said as she eyed the cup full of pineapple rings.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Rei muttered to herself as she picked up her backpack and hefted
it onto her shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;ll see you guys in class tomorrow.&quot;
     &quot;Erm?&quot; Serena said as she froze in mid-motion, her fingers still crammed
in her mouth and holding the pear wedge.  She quickly chewed and swallowed,
absently wiping her fingertips on the side of her school uniform.  &quot;You&#39;re not
coming with us to the cathedral?&quot;
     Rei snorted quietly to herself.  &quot;I&#39;ve got work to do at the temple,&quot; she
reminded her in a somewhat arch tone.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t there during the weekend, of
course, and Jedyt didn&#39;t take care of it all like Grandpa thought he had, so
I&#39;ve still got some catching-up to do.&quot;
     &quot;Merk!&quot; Mina gagged as she half-choked on the pineapple wedge.  She made
a face as she was forced to swallow it hard and gasp for air once it was free
from her windpipe.  &quot;Wait, back up.  Jedyt was at the temple again?  While we
were camped out in Susan&#39;s keep?&quot;
     Rei paused as she realized that she had said just a little more than she
had intended to say.  &quot;Yes, he was,&quot; she finally spoke up after a brief but
discernible silence.  &quot;He wanted to talk to Grandpa about having to leave last
year without warning and wanted to make it up by taking care of the chores I
usually did.&quot;
     &quot;Really....&quot; Mina said in a very slow tone, giving the priestess an uneasy
look.  Next to her, Ami and Serena traded startled glances, both wondering just
why exactly Jedyt would even consider doing such a thing.
     &quot;Ask him yourself if you don&#39;t believe me,&quot; Rei said flatly, her face
slipping into a mask of guarded and utterly unreadable emotions.
     Mina blinked at the shift in Rei&#39;s mood before nodding slowly.  &quot;Believe
me, I will,&quot; she promised quietly.  &quot;Huh,&quot; she added as she glanced over to see
how Serena and Ami were reacting.  &quot;You know, maybe there&#39;s a glimmer of hope
for that boy after all.  Don&#39;t look at me like that,&quot; she added as Ami promptly
scowled.
     &quot;What are you planning on doing?&quot; Ami inquired in a faintly-edged tone.
     &quot;I&#39;m not planning on anything,&quot; Mina countered as she fished another piece
of pineapple out of the fruit cup and popped it into her mouth.  &quot;Sailo&#39; V ish
gonna talk t&#39; him an&#39; fin&#39; ou&#39; wha&#39;s hish problem ish.&quot;
     Leda just rolled her eyes as she zipped her backpack shut and hoisted it
up by the straps.  &quot;It&#39;s pineapple, not seafood,&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;Want to quit
pulling an Alex and stop talking with your mouth full?  It&#39;s disgusting.&quot;
     &quot;Blech,&quot; Serena muttered as she glanced down at the three-quarters empty
fruit cup in her hand and made a sour face.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Rei sighed as she started to walk off.  &quot;Try not to cause any
trouble tonight.  HEY!&quot; she protested as Leda reached out to snag one of the
straps on her backpack, jerking her back with a casual tug.
     &quot;You want to stick around for a couple more minutes, pyro?&quot; Leda sighed.
She paused and raised an eyebrow as the strap was gently but firmly yanked out
of her hand.
     &quot;No, I don&#39;t,&quot; Rei said briskly.  She cast a very brief sidelong glance at
Serena before returning her gaze to the brunette.  &quot;You can call me on the
communicator if something happens.  Otherwise, I&#39;ve got work to do.  I&#39;ll see
you tomorrow,&quot; she said before she turned around and headed off.
     &quot;You know,&quot; Mina sighed quietly as she watched Rei&#39;s figure retreating
into the distance, &quot;At first I thought it was just the PMS kicking in just a
little harder than usual, but that quit how long ago?  I&#39;m not sure what the
problem is, but it&#39;s starting to really worry me now.  Ami, are you sure she&#39;s
okay in a physical sense?&quot;
     Ami glanced over at the blonde before shaking her head.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, I
haven&#39;t scanned her recently,&quot; she said quietly.
     &quot;See if you can arrange something,&quot; Mina suggested as she tossed the last
bite of pineapple into her mouth.  &quot;You know, real quiet-like an&#39; all.  I&#39;ve
got a few errands to run, so I&#39;ll catch up with you at the cathedral in a bit,
okay?&quot; she said as she picked up her backpack and started to head towards the
nearest trash can, ostensibly to dispose of the now-empty fruit cup.
     &quot;Remind us again what you&#39;re plotting?&quot; Leda inquired warily.
     Mina resisted the urge to roll her eyes as she pitched the cup into the
barrel and absently wiped her fingertips across the back of her skirt.  &quot;Like
I said, I&#39;m not doing anything, Sailor V is.  And don&#39;t ask me what she&#39;s going
to do because I don&#39;t think she&#39;s decided yet.  Planning ahead of time isn&#39;t
exactly her strong suit,&quot; she added with an impish wink.
     &quot;We&#39;ve noticed,&quot; Ami said dryly in a tone as flat as paved concrete.
     &quot;Oh, pooh, listen to you guys,&quot; Mina huffed.  &quot;Don&#39;t make me remind you
that I&#39;ve been dealing with Jedyt long before you had a clue that there were
green-blooded goobers running around our world.&quot;
     Ami and Leda traded looks before Leda shook her head.  &quot;You just did,&quot; she
pointed out in a rueful tone.
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; Mina said dismissively.  &quot;My point is that you girls just need
to back off and settle down.  It&#39;s my turn at bat this inning, okay?  Let me
swing at the ball however I want.  If I strike out, then it&#39;ll be your turn to
spank him stupid, but for now all I&#39;m asking you to do is *trust me*.&quot;
     Leda glanced over at Ami and paused briefly as she noticed the slightly
haunted look on not just Ami&#39;s face but Serena&#39;s as well.  &quot;You&#39;re really that
sure about this one, eh?&quot; she prodded as she turned back to Mina.  She got a
fairly serious look in response followed by a solemn nod, resulting in a quiet
sigh from the brunette.  &quot;Alright, screwball,&quot; she said in a weary tone.  &quot;You
go do whatever it is you gotta do, but you had damn well better check in with
us when you&#39;re done,&quot; she warned.  &quot;If we don&#39;t hear from you by....&quot;
     &quot;Midnight,&quot; Mina smoothly interjected.
     &quot;Midnight, then,&quot; Leda echoed with a nod of understanding.
     &quot;Eight,&quot; Ami spoke up in an edged tone, giving Mina a flat glare.  &quot;You
said you&#39;d be meeting him at sunset, right?&quot;
     &quot;Yes, and I have no idea how long this&#39;ll take to iron out,&quot; Mina replied
with a wary look.  &quot;Sundown starts at seven, and I don&#39;t like to be rushed for
this kind of thing.  Eleven.&quot;
     &quot;Nine,&quot; Ami countered.  &quot;Two hours should be more than enough to tell him
to go fly a kite into a power line and die.&quot;
     Leda just chuckled quietly to herself.  &quot;Just a little bitter, eh?&quot;
     &quot;Split the difference at ten?&quot; Mina offered.
     &quot;Nine,&quot; Serena spoke up, taking everyone by surprise.  &quot;We have school in
the morning, and I don&#39;t want to have to lose much sleep if we have to chase
you down in the middle of the night.&quot;
     Mina wrinkled her nose in distain.  &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; she drawled.  &quot;Nice to
see where your priorities are, girl.  In any case, like I said, I&#39;ll catch up
with you at the cathedral in about an hour.  Think we can do a little group
studying before dinner?&quot;
     &quot;Sure,&quot; Leda said as she shook her head to herself, absently starting to
wonder what she should cook for dinner.  &quot;Anyway, we need to get going.  It&#39;s
only been a few hours, but we might want to check in with Whisper to see if
she&#39;s heard anything new.  That, and see how Alex and Michelle are holding up.
Michelle can probably keep herself occupied on her own, but I have the sneaking
suspicion Alex will be crawling the walls by now out of boredom.&quot;
     &quot;What makes you say that?&quot; Ami inquired as she started to follow after the
brunette, briefly pausing to make sure Serena could keep up with them without
tripping over something while she finished off the rest of her fruit cup.
     &quot;Pah,&quot; Leda sighed.  &quot;In the words of Quasimodo.... call it a hunch....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     Whisper sighed and waited for the ringing sound in her ears to fade before
turning to cast a somewhat weary look at Sailor Neptune.  &quot;You sure you don&#39;t
want me to save a few of them for you?&quot; she offered.
     Neptune cast a quick glance at the piles of ruin and devastation that now
comprised the other half of the room before shaking her head.  &quot;No,&quot; she sighed
quietly.  &quot;I can&#39;t hit small targets like that without making a mess and you
don&#39;t need salt water ending up in any of the recovery bins.  Besides, it&#39;s
keeping her occupied.  How many are left, anyway?&quot;
     Whisper turned back to look at the display panel.  &quot;An even dozen.  Well,
ten now,&quot; she added ruefully as she tapped a button twice.  A pair of popping
sounds could be heard on the other side of the room as two of the target drones
were promptly ejected and began buzzing around like large flies.
     In a rather unexpected move, Sailor Uranus immediately turned to the side
and hopped back towards the wall instead of charging the drones as she had been
doing.  The purpose of the move became obvious an instant later as she pushed
herself off of the wall while still in mid-air, reversing the direction of her
momentum and sending her almost literally flying towards the drones that had
started to pursue her.
     &quot;Soul Saber SLICE!&quot; Uranus yelled out as she darted between them.  The tip
of her saber immediately began to emit a blue glow, carving a visible line of
energy into the air behind the blade like a wake.  The blade was then swung at
a horizontal angle, causing both the edge and the wave of energy to brush past
a drone, neatly cleaving it in two.  The ruined electronic halves immediately
exploded into fragments, littering the floor with yet more smouldering debris
and peppering her arm with twin sprays of shrapnel.
     The blonde Sailor Scout landed hard on her feet and immediately switched
her focus to her other side, reaching out with her free hand to make a fist.
&quot;Uranus Shockwave....&quot; she intoned as she drew energy out of the air, gathering
it around her clenched fist to form a ball of golden-yellow light.  &quot;IMPACT!&quot;
she shouted as she made a throwing motion, sending the sphere of energy darting
after the second drone that was only now reacting to the fact that she had
breezed past it.
     The shockwave left a trail of visibly-disturbed air in its wake as it
crossed the gap, slamming into the drone with a tremendous force hard enough to
literally flatten it against the wall like a soda can.  As the previous drone
had done when fatally damaged, the overloaded device exploded into a smoking
ruin in a loosely-controlled process that resulted in a stinging but non-lethal
shower of metallic fragments.
     &quot;Heh, heh,&quot; Uranus chuckled quietly, ignoring the sharp line of pain that
was drawn on her exposed upper arm by a drone fragment.  There were literally
dozens of tiny nicks and cuts on her arms and face from previous explosions and
debris showers, though only two were deep enough to do anything more than ooze
blood and plasma for longer than a few seconds.  &quot;Wasn&#39;t expecting that one,
now were you, sucker?  Whew,&quot; she panted as she reached out to rest against the
wall for a moment.  &quot;Hang on a second, Whisper, I think I&#39;m starting to run out
of gas here.&quot;
     &quot;No problem,&quot; Whisper called back, absently shaking her head to herself.
     &quot;Are you sure this cleans up easy?&quot; Neptune muttered as she glanced around
the training room.  The drone carcasses and debris were literally ankle-deep in
a number of places and it was starting to become difficult for Uranus to find
places to move and fight where she wouldn&#39;t be tripping over something.
     &quot;Maze was kind enough to automate a few things and build a sweeper drone,&quot;
the telepath replied, casting a glance at the closed doors of the vault.  &quot;At
least, I&#39;m fairly sure he did.  I remember him testing it out one day, but I
wasn&#39;t actively paying attention to what he was muttering so he might not have
ironed all the bugs out.  Even if we have to sweep it up ourselves, all we need
to do is just dump the parts in the recycle hopper and let the computer handle
the rest.&quot;
     &quot;Bleh,&quot; Neptune muttered as she surveyed the carnage around her and tried
not to imagine how long it would take to sweep up by hand.  She blinked and
cast a look at Whisper as the computer made a soft beep to itself, flashing an
oddly-shaped icon in the center of the display for a few seconds.
     &quot;Hmm....&quot; Whisper murmured to herself as she studied the display.  She
typed in a quick command, resulting in several lines of the spidery denizen
language to rapidly scroll up.  &quot;That&#39;s odd.&quot;
     &quot;Something wrong?&quot; Neptune ventured, casting a quick glance over at Uranus
to see how she was doing.  Comforted by the fact that the blonde seemed to be
just fine as she swung her saber around in slow arcs, she turned her attention
back to Whisper and the alien text on the screen.
     &quot;Not really,&quot; Whisper admitted.  &quot;The external sensors just picked up Ami
and Leda entering the outer perimeter, as well as a third individual that the
computer is having a hard time identifying.  It says that the bio-scan keeps
coming back with an echo that isn&#39;t matching up with anything ever encountered
before, but for some reason it seems it has a partial match and wants to gather
the rest of the picture to make a positive identification.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, they&#39;re coming from school, right?&quot; Neptune asked carefully.  &quot;So
shouldn&#39;t Serena be with them?&quot;
     The telepath blinked and cast a quick glance at her before typing in a
series of commands, leaning on the edge of the console as she waited for the
computer core to respond.  It seemed to take an unusually long time to process
before it finally began to display more lines of spidery text.  &quot;Ahh, that&#39;s
it,&quot; she said with a nod of satisfaction.  &quot;It is Serena after all, it&#39;s just
that the sensors were picking up the echo of her wings and couldn&#39;t quite make
sense of them.  That, and it seems her alpha template has changed,&quot; she added
in a slightly uneasy tone.  &quot;I&#39;m hoping it&#39;s just from the Chaos Factor changes
to her body, as physical characteristics are a recorded criterion, but maybe
her mind has changed slightly as well.  We&#39;ll see.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Neptune asked in a worried tone.
     &quot;Hey, Mich?&quot; Uranus called out from the other side of the room, a slight
frown forming on her face as she could see the change in Neptune&#39;s expression.
&quot;What&#39;s the problem, babe?&quot;
     &quot;The Princess is here,&quot; Neptune called back.
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Uranus said as she glanced around the room.  &quot;Great, the floor is
a mess and I could probably use a shower.  Hey, you think you can keep her busy
upstairs while I clean up?  Don&#39;t need her coming down here and seeing the
place all torn up like this....&quot;
     Whisper chuckled quietly to herself.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, this
room was designed for that exact situation.  You should have seen the mess the
others made the last time we hauled out the target drones for practice.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; Uranus said as she carefully slogged her way through the piles
of drone parts to approach them.  &quot;How long did that mess take to clean up?&quot;
     &quot;Not too long,&quot; Whisper assured her as she keyed in a few commands.  The
computer immediately chittered back at her as a truly deep and heavy sound
started up.  The two-foot-thick bulkheads of the vault began to very slowly
retract into the ceiling and floor a few moments later, moving at a pace that
was somewhere between ponderous and glacial.
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Uranus grunted.  &quot;It&#39;ll probably take longer to open the damn door
than to shovel some of this crap out of the way.  Hey, tell me again just why
that has to be so heavy and all?&quot; she added as she gave Whisper a questioning
look.
     &quot;It&#39;s part of a weapons-storage vault,&quot; Whisper explained as she kept one
eye on the computer display readings and the other on the slowly widening gap
between the upper and lower halves of the vault doors.  &quot;The doors, walls, and
ceiling are just as thick.  It serves two purposes, namely to keep out those
who don&#39;t have proper access and to attempt to contain any accidental explosion
or release of energy from anything inside of it.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Neptune said, her eyes widening.
     &quot;Wait, slow down,&quot; Uranus said a fraction of a second later, a dark frown
marring her face.  &quot;I can understand the part about keeping people out, but run
the rest of it past me again?  It&#39;s supposed to keep something inside?&quot;
     Whisper sighed quietly to herself as she tried to decide how to explain it
to the pair of humans.  &quot;Think about what you saw in there,&quot; she said after a
moment of careful thought.  &quot;There are hundreds of weapons stored inside, and
not all of them are simple things like swords and rifles.  Some of them are
very complicated energy weapons, like the plasma swords and the rail-gun.  If
a serious problem develops with those kinds of weapons, they run a minor but
still very real and dangerous risk of blowing up.  Because of the risk they can
pose, even as small as it is, they can only be stored in places where such an
uncontrolled or accidental release of energy can be readily contained by the
surrounding environment.  Hence the seemingly silly size of the bulkheads,&quot; she
summarized with a gesture to the now half-open vault doors.
     &quot;Ah, okay,&quot; Uranus said in a slightly uneasy tone.  &quot;That also why you
closed those shield doors over there?&quot; she added, pointing with her saber at
the hallway blast doors.  She blinked in surprise as the computer terminal
chittered quietly to itself before it began to retract the blast doors.  &quot;Hey,
why&#39;s it doing that?&quot;
     &quot;Probably because someone on the outside wants in,&quot; Whisper said dryly as
the hallway doors finished retracting to expose the standard bulkheads of the
main door.  The door hissed open a moment later, framing a visibly curious Leda
in the archway.  &quot;And yes, I closed the blast doors because of the tendency for
the drones to explode when hit too hard.  Afternoon, Leda,&quot; the telepath called
out to the brunette.
     &quot;Hey there,&quot; Leda said affably as she looked around the room, her green
eyes doubling in diameter as she noticed the piles of exploded drone parts.
&quot;Wow, I see someone had fun in here earlier....&quot;
     Uranus shrugged in dismissal and absently twirled her Soul Saber around.
&quot;Just a little afternoon practice, that&#39;s all.  How&#39;s the Princess doing?&quot;
     &quot;Serena?  She&#39;s....&quot; Leda started to say before pausing to wince as the
massive vault doors finished retracting into the housings and locked into place
with a pair of teeth-rattling booms.  &quot;Ow.  She&#39;s fine.  You know you can hear
the door being opened from outside, right?&quot; she added, giving Whisper a mild
look.  &quot;Not very loudly, of course, but you can feel the ground rumbling from
a good twenty feet away from the cathedral&#39;s front door.&quot;
     &quot;Is that why you all but ran down here?&quot; Ami&#39;s dry voice could be heard as
she exited the stairwell and approached the open training room doors.
     &quot;Well,&quot; Leda hedged in a faintly sheepish tone, &quot;I figured that if the
vault was being cracked open, we&#39;d be able to play with the target drones for
a bit.  You know, like what Sailor Uranus just said a moment ago, a little
afternoon drone practice and all.  Speaking of which, did you leave us any?&quot;
she added in a rueful tone as she glanced around the room again.
     &quot;Goodness!&quot; Ami gasped as she finally noticed the smoking piles of ruin
that carpeted three-fourths of the training room floor.
     &quot;There should be a few left over, right?&quot; Uranus said as she looked over
at Neptune and Whisper.
     &quot;Just ten,&quot; Whisper replied wryly.
     &quot;Just ten?&quot; Leda echoed with a hard blink.  &quot;Isn&#39;t a full load somewhere
around four hundred?&quot;
     &quot;Four-twenty,&quot; the telepath sighed.  &quot;And yes, we were at maximum when we
started earlier.  Would you girls step off to the side there, please?&quot; she said
as she made a gesture.  &quot;I&#39;m trying to see if I can bring ADRARU online and
turn it loose.  I think it&#39;s functional, but it doesn&#39;t seem to be in much of
a cooperative mood for some reason....&quot;
     &quot;Ad-what?&quot; Uranus said in a confused tone.
     &quot;Add-Rah-Roo,&quot; Ami said slowly.  &quot;Automated Drone Recovery And Recycling
Unit.  Code nine, function two, option two,&quot; she added to Whisper.
     Whisper just grunted softly to herself as she rekeyed the command, trying
not to sigh as she heard a quiet beeping sound start up from within the arsenal
vault.  &quot;There we go, I was trying function one,&quot; she confessed.
     &quot;Hey, Sparky,&quot; Leda said as a small six-wheeled box-like drone rolled out
of the vault.  It looked like a street-sweeper that had been scaled down in
size so that it was only waist-high and perhaps twice as long.  A bright orange
strobe mounted on the top immediately lit up as it went to work, spinning up
the rotating brushes in front as it rolled over to the nearest pile of debris.
The sound of a vacuum started up a few moments later, followed by a series of
clanking sounds as the broken parts were sucked inside the holding tank.
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Uranus said quietly as she watched the recovery drone&#39;s progress.
&quot;A remote-controlled vacuum cleaner or something?&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s a drone,&quot; Ami explained.  &quot;It&#39;s self-automated and has the ability
to make its own decisions based on the information it processes and from what
its onboard sensors say is around it.  Maze did most of the hardware and I put
together the logic modules,&quot; she added with a hint of pride.  &quot;We haven&#39;t had
time to perfect it, but we think we&#39;ve managed to work out most of the bugs.
It won&#39;t run over your foot or try to suck up anything other than drone parts,
but it still needs to be monitored, though,&quot; she added with a soft sigh.
     &quot;You mean it won&#39;t run over your foot anymore,&quot; Leda muttered quietly.
     &quot;Hush, it didn&#39;t hurt you,&quot; Ami whispered back in a faintly-edged tone.
&quot;And that was Maze&#39;s fault for not wiring the tread-sensors properly, so don&#39;t
try to blame the software for that one.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, so this is one of your toys, then?&quot; Uranus said, her eyebrows arching
up in surprise.  &quot;Kinda like your little computer, right?&quot;
     &quot;Sort of,&quot; Ami said after a slight hesitation.
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; the blonde said absently as she glanced over at Neptune.  The
other girl gave her a look of mild curiosity and intrigue in return before
nodding her head in seeming acceptance of the invention.  &quot;We really could&#39;ve
used one of these back in the Moon Kingdom,&quot; Uranus said as she returned her
saber to its sheath.  &quot;Even if it was only to pick up the dirty socks and the
like from the floor on the weekends.&quot;
     &quot;Alex,&quot; Neptune sighed quietly.
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying it would have been useful, hon,&quot; Uranus shrugged in
dismissal.  She paused and glanced around the room, making absent note of the
way a path had already been cleared by the drone.  &quot;So where&#39;s the Princess,
anyway?&quot; she inquired.
     Both Ami and Leda immediately blinked and looked behind them, exchanging
uneasy glances as they realized that the long-haired blonde had either wandered
off or slipped away very quietly for some reason.  &quot;She better not be in the
kitchen,&quot; Ami grumbled as she turned around to head back upstairs.
     &quot;Easy, tiger,&quot; Leda said as she gently put a hand on Ami&#39;s arm.  &quot;Serena
could be using the bathroom for all we know.  Remember, if she digests faster
now, it stands to reason she also processes everything quicker, right?&quot;
     Ami paused before nodding slowly.  &quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; she admitted before her
vampiric hearing picked up the sound of a pair of quiet footsteps making their
way down the staircase.  She leaned forward to see around the edge of the door
frame and immediately blinked, a pale blush rising to her cheeks.  &quot;Serena!&quot;
she gasped in slight shock.
     Serena gave her a slightly upset look as she continued to munch on a small
sandwich with her left hand.  Her blouse and bra had been removed somewhere
along the line and were being held against her bare chest with only minimally
effective coverage by her right hand.  Her denizen wings were floating freely
in the air behind her, carefully drawn inward into a more compact shape as she
left the fairly narrow confines of the stairwell.
     Leda glanced over her shoulder and did a classic double-take, blinking at
Serena&#39;s partial state of undress.  &quot;You, uh, feeling a little warm today or
something, Serena?&quot; she inquired in a very cautious tone.
     &quot;I felt confined,&quot; Serena whispered, her three-tone denizen voice sounding
distinctly musical and angelic as she spoke.  &quot;I didn&#39;t feel like trying to
find something with an open back, and I already put the swimsuit in with the
dirty laundry....&quot;
     &quot;Hey, your Highness,&quot; Uranus said as she gave her a brief curtsy.  &quot;Good
to see you again.  You holding up okay, wings aside?  I don&#39;t know about you,
and I&#39;d probably have to ask Sue what she thinks, but I can see how it would
get a bit cramped if you have to keep your wings in your back pocket all day.
I can probably find you a tank top or something if you want....&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;ll find something in a moment,&quot; Neptune said as she stepped forward,
giving Serena a warm smile.  She blinked and paused as she suddenly found her
path blocked by Ami as the blue-haired girl moved closer to Serena with her
miniature computer in hand.
     &quot;Hold still, Serena,&quot; Ami muttered in a tone of resignation as she toyed
with the scanner settings before starting to pass the edge of the device back
and forth over Serena&#39;s abdomen.
     &quot;Wow,&quot; Serena said quietly as she leaned to one side to peer past both Ami
and Sailor Neptune.  &quot;That&#39;s quite a mess with the drones.  What happened?&quot;
     Uranus chuckled quietly and cracked her knuckles.  &quot;Just a little casual
afternoon practice,&quot; she said with a wolfish grin.  She paused and blinked in
unison with the rest of the group as a decidedly flat beep of protest was heard
from the recovery drone.  A quick glance over her shoulder showed that the
ADRARU was nose-first in the corner and was trying to progress forward to reach
the last few fragments that were just beyond the reach of its brushes.
     &quot;Damn it,&quot; Ami growled very quietly to herself, causing both Serena and
Leda to unobtrusively edge away from her.  &quot;I thought I fixed that already.&quot;
     &quot;Bad angle of approach?&quot; Whisper suggested carefully.
     &quot;It should have figured out that it&#39;s dealing with a corner and realigned
itself against one of the walls,&quot; Ami muttered as she absently tucked her
computer back in her Lunar Space pocket without checking any of the readings.
     Leda and Uranus quickly exchanged glances before the brunette jerked her
chin towards the stairwell.  &quot;C&#39;mon, starlight, let&#39;s go find you something to
wear that won&#39;t crimp your wings,&quot; Uranus said quietly to Serena as she began
to gently usher her back towards the stairs.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I don&#39;t have
any problems with you wandering around like that to let your tits get some air
every so often, but that&#39;s usually best saved for after a warm bath....&quot;
     Serena blinked and gave the other blonde a dubious look while Whisper and
Neptune exchanged pained looks.  Leda simply closed her eyes and massaged her
sinuses as she stepped back to make room, following them into the stairwell
once the way was clear.
     &quot;We will catch up with you girls later,&quot; Whisper said to Neptune as she
edged back to let Ami have full access to the computer terminal.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure
how long this will take, but between her, me, and the drone, we should have it
all cleaned up and tossed in the recycle hopper long before it&#39;s time to start
making dinner.&quot;
     &quot;Okay,&quot; Neptune said with a nod of understanding.  She considered saying
something to Ami, only to quickly change her mind as the blue-haired girl began
typing in commands at a rapid rate and muttering quietly to herself in two
different languages.  &quot;Thanks,&quot; she said after a slightly awkward pause, giving
Whisper a slightly uneasy smile before half-running towards the door.
     The telepath counted to ten in her mind before turning to regard Ami with
guarded curiosity.  &quot;Well?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     &quot;Pause, pause, interpret, pause, compile, interpret, react,&quot; Ami muttered
to herself as she traced down the logic path, completely oblivious to what the
denizen woman had just said.  &quot;Why are you still in the corner?  You had the
sensor data here, and it got passed into the logic matrix here....&quot;
     Whisper just sighed and cast a leery glance towards the open vault doors.
&quot;Well, I suppose I could always do that inventory report I&#39;ve been putting off
for a week now,&quot; she said to herself as she made her way over to the archway.
She paused in mid-motion as she glanced over at the far left corner to where
the plasma sword recharging unit was, suddenly remembering that Mina still had
one of them in her possession.
     I really need to ask her about it, she thought to herself as she accessed
the small library computer inside the vault that dealt with inventory.  Where
is she, anyway?  And Rei, for that matter?  I&#39;m sure they both have things to
do after school and all, but after what happened over the weekend I&#39;m not sure
leaving them alone would be a good idea.  Well, they&#39;ve all got communicators,
she added with a mental shrug as she picked up a portable data tablet and began
to download the inventory list to it.  If something does happen, I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll
be hearing about it real soon.  Now, about this v&#39;tek&#39;ka inventory....

                *               *               *               *

     Rei paused and glanced up at the tree, her eyes narrowing slightly as the
pair of ravens continued to make an unusual amount of noise.  They had been
nesting in the tree for years, although she had yet to see any eggs or signs of
baby ravens being hatched, and she had often thought of them as simply being a
part of the temple.  Mina had taken to calling them Phobos and Deimos lately,
quietly explaining once how they were the names of the two moons of the planet
Mars.  That had prompted a very dark glare from the priestess, but then her
grandfather had approached and further discussion on the matter quickly ended.
     A soft shuffling sound behind her was her only warning that she wasn&#39;t
alone anymore.  &quot;Noisy today, aren&#39;t they?&quot; a very familiar voice said quietly.
     &quot;It&#39;s Monday,&quot; Rei sighed as she glanced over her shoulder.  &quot;That tends
to ruffle everyone&#39;s feathers.&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; her grandfather chuckled quietly as he shifted the box of trinkets
on his shoulder.  The temple&#39;s gift store was more like a large shelf instead
of a proper store, but it did enough business to make it more than worth the
hassle and effort to keep it properly stocked.  &quot;So how was school?&quot; he asked,
partly out of habit but also partly out of genuine curiosity.
     &quot;Like I said, it&#39;s Monday,&quot; Rei muttered darkly as she cast a glance at
the tree.  One of the ravens promptly cawed at her for several seconds, which
only added to her somewhat dark mood.
     &quot;Which class is it this time?&quot; her grandfather prodded in a wary tone.
     Rei resisted the urge to roll her eyes as she turned back to face him.
&quot;Pick one.  We&#39;ve got a Biology quiz tomorrow about shellfish, a Linear Algebra
quiz on Wednesday with multiple variables, and a History test on Friday about
the first World War,&quot; she summarized sourly.
     &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; her grandfather said quietly with a bemused expression.  &quot;If I
were in your shoes, Rei, I would worry more about the math and history tests.
Your Biology grades are important too, but I&#39;m not going to get upset if you
can&#39;t remember the difference between a clam and an oyster.  I just know they
both go well with cucumber sauce,&quot; he added with a faintly wicked chuckle.
     &quot;I&#39;ll do my best,&quot; Rei replied dryly.  She paused as she noticed a sudden
change in her grandfather&#39;s expression, his attention focused on something or
someone behind her.  She instinctively turned around, having learned the hard
way as a Sailor Scout that sometimes there wasn&#39;t enough time for a warning to
be given after an oddity that had been noticed suddenly became a very dangerous
and active threat.
     She spotted the likely source of attention almost instantly, as one would
almost have to be blind to miss the sun-yellow and orange colors of the monk&#39;s
robes.  He appeared to be somewhere in his thirties, but there was a sort of
ageless aura to him that she could clearly discern from halfway across the
temple grounds, suggesting that he might actually be older than he appeared.
He was looking around with a rather tranquil expression, as if he had all the
time in the world in which to stop and study every blade of grass.
     &quot;Rei?&quot; her grandfather said quietly in a tone that she very rarely heard
from him.  It wasn&#39;t loud or harsh in the slightest, but there was still a very
clear undercurrent of carefully and deliberately hidden emotion that instantly
worried her.  &quot;You should go inside and change, perhaps even start studying.
The chores can wait until after dinner.&quot;
     &quot;Grandpa....&quot; she started to say before she even had an idea of what she
wanted to say.
     &quot;Pah,&quot; he grumbled quietly as he shifted the weight of the box perched on
his shoulder.  &quot;Jokes about shellfish aside, Rei, you do have a test tomorrow
that you should study for, and we both know that your science grades could use
a little improvement.  The chores can wait,&quot; he added as he turned towards the
gift shop.  He paused for a moment before twisting to glance around the box to
look at her.  &quot;Unless you really want to start restocking all these postcards,&quot;
he added in a fairly mild tone.
     &quot;No thanks,&quot; Rei muttered as she cast a reflexive glance towards the gift
shop.  She didn&#39;t have any problems with the constant sweeping and cleaning
that needed to be done from having a steady stream of visitors and worshippers
to the temple, and the rest of the general maintenance chores were tolerable to
one degree or another, but she absolutely hated working in the gift shop.  Not
that it was the work itself that grated on her, but having to deal with some of
the potential customers.  Most of them were nice, but a number of them thought
she was &#39;of age&#39; because she worked there and thus felt like they could hit on
her as if she were a nineteen-year-old college student or something.  And more
than one had been dense enough to not take &#39;no&#39; for an answer....
     &quot;Just checking,&quot; her grandfather chuckled quietly to himself, mercifully
disrupting her dark train of thought.  He cast a very quick and very subtle
glance behind him before heading off towards the tiny store, leaving Rei alone
on the sidewalk.
     Okay.... Rei thought to herself, realizing that something was bothering
her grandfather.  She glanced over at the brightly-robed monk again, noticing
that he was quietly making his way towards the public part of the temple.  She
thought it odd for a Shaolin monk to pay a visit to a Shinto temple, but her
grandfather had taught her enough about Zen Buddhism to realize that it really
didn&#39;t matter where or how or even what one worshipped, so long as the feelings
of inner-peace and self-enlightenment were achieved.
     More power to him, then, she thought in dismissal as she turned to head
towards the private residence.  She paused and cast an irritated glance over
her shoulder as both ravens started to make a loud racket, cackling and cawing
at her in unusually strident tones.  &quot;Give it a rest, guys,&quot; she grumbled as
she started walking.
     It only took a few seconds to dump her backpack in a corner of her bedroom
and exchange her school uniform for the red skirt and white robes that she wore
around the temple.  She sometimes stopped to wonder why she bothered, as she
wasn&#39;t a true Shinto priestess by any stretch of the imagination, but neither
her grandfather nor any of the other Shinto monks who visited on rare occasion
had said anything to her about it or otherwise raised any objections.  The long
and voluminous skirt was sometimes an annoyance, especially in the heat of the
summer months and during the icy chill of winter, but it was otherwise a rather
comfortable and surprisingly unrestrictive outfit to wear.
     The small firepit in the middle of what passed for their living room was
lit, of course, as it was only extinguished when neither of them were awake and
around to keep a casual eye on it.  There had only been two instances that she
could remember where the fire-extinguisher in the corner had to be used to put
the flames out in a hurry, once because of some chemical spill on the wood used
that week that reacted badly to excessive heat, and the second time because of
a typhoon in the area that ripped off the silk-screen doors and allowed the
insanely-strong wind gusts to scatter burning embers all over the place.
     That was not fun, she thought distantly at the memory of the typhoon.  It
had scared the hell out of her at the time, but subsequent instances of such
heavy tropical disturbances and her grandfather&#39;s insistence on weathering them
out in the temple had taught her that one could respect danger without having
to fear it.  At least, not with a visibly panicked expression....
     A soft knock on the half-closed silk-screen doors caused her to lift her
head up, gently bringing her out of the meditative trance that she had already
started to unconsciously slip into.  She blinked hard as she saw the Shaolin
monk standing outside with his hands clasped in front of him and an oddly calm
look on his face.
     &quot;The temple is off to the right,&quot; Rei said without thinking about it.  It
was a rare week in which someone didn&#39;t become either confused or slightly lost
as to which structure was the actual shrine and which one was the private
residence.  She personally thought it was patently obvious, given the size of
the temple in comparison to the residence as well as its prominent place on the
temple grounds, but she would readily admit that sometimes she herself would
have what Mina called a brain-fart and do something stupid.  Or as what Leda
more accurately called it, usually to both Mina and Serena&#39;s immediate chagrin,
a blonde moment.
     The monk bowed his head to her.  &quot;Forgive my intrusion,&quot; he said in a very
calm and pleasant voice, &quot;But I am here to see.... your grandfather.&quot;
     The hair on the back of Rei&#39;s neck immediately stood up, not missing the
very slight but still discernible hesitation in his words.  &quot;He should be over
at the gift shop,&quot; she said carefully, still remaining in a kneeling position
before the fire.
     The monk bowed to her again and turned to leave, only to remain perfectly
motionless at something outside of Rei&#39;s field of vision.  The cause became
clear a moment later as a wrinkled hand reached in to grab the door, sliding
it back fully to permit her grandfather entry into the building.
     &quot;The temple is off to the right,&quot; he said in a perfectly neutral tone as
he brushed past the monk as if he didn&#39;t exist.  &quot;It closes to the public at
sunset, so feel free to remain there as long as you wish until then.&quot;
     &quot;It is good to see you, Master Wen,&quot; the monk replied, neither his calm
tone nor his serene expression changing in the slightest.
     The gentle words had an immediate effect on Rei&#39;s grandfather, causing him
to very abruptly freeze in mid-stride.  He closed his eyes a moment later, but
not before Rei could catch a glimpse of what might have been anger suddenly
ingiting in their dark depths.  &quot;Do not,&quot; he said very slowly and clearly in a
voice devoid of any semblance of emotion that nonetheless gave Rei an immediate
chill, &quot;Dare to call me that ever again.  State your business and leave.&quot;
     Rei blinked hard and shifted her focus to the fire, doing her best to keep
her expression as impassive as possible.  She couldn&#39;t ever remember hearing
her grandfather be that curt with someone before, nor could she remember anyone
addressing him as the monk had.  Part of her wanted to offer a polite excuse
and make a quiet exit for the sanctity of her bedroom, but another part of her
very much wanted to find out just what the hell was going on all of a sudden.
     The monk watched impassively as the old man knelt down in front of the
fire in such a way that he could still observe the doorway with most of his
back turned to his visitor.  It was a very subtle message, one that they both
understood clearly.  &quot;I am not here to aggravate old wounds,&quot; he said calmly.
     &quot;Then leave, it&#39;s that simple,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather replied quietly.
     The monk tilted his head slightly but his expression otherwise remained
unchanged.  &quot;Has the imbalance grown so strong that you are no longer even open
to anything that might be said, for whatever reason?&quot; he asked.  &quot;Or has your
disagreement expanded further to encompass me as well?&quot;
     The old man sighed heavily and allowed his chin to sink down towards his
chest slightly, his shoulders slumping from an unknown burden.  &quot;Why have you
come here?&quot; he asked in an audibly weary tone.
     &quot;The Tulku has asked me to deliver a message to you,&quot; the monk replied
calmly, still standing outside the open screen doors.  &quot;I will take your reply
back to him should you have one.  I was also asked to deliver one to your....
granddaughter, Rei, and await her reply.&quot;
     &quot;Leave her out of this,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather immediately spat out, whirling
around and leaping to his feet in a surprisingly fluid movement.
     Rei couldn&#39;t help looking up from the firepit to stare at both the monk
and her grandfather.  She still didn&#39;t have the slightest clue as to what was
going on, but she was beginning to feel more and more uneasy about the entire
situation with each passing moment.
     &quot;As I said, I am only a messenger,&quot; the monk said in that maddeningly calm
voice as he removed a pair of scroll cases from some hidden location in his
yellow-and-orange robes.  &quot;I am told that there are two parts to the message
for you, but his Holiness only described one part to me.  The other part holds
his personal thoughts, which are for you alone,&quot; he said as he held out one of
the cases.  &quot;His exact words are unknown to me, but I should be able to answer
your questions about his proposition in his stead.&quot;
     The old man stared at the offered case in silence for a number of moments
before he grudgingly moved forward to accept it.  The polished wooden case had
obviously seen better years, but it felt quite solid in his hands as he broke
the wax seal on the top and lifted the lid.
     Rei blinked as she saw him withdraw a literal scroll, a length of what
appeared to be parchment attached to two small segments of bamboo.  She wasn&#39;t
able to read whatever was written on the parchment, but she could tell by the
way it reflected the dim light of the fire that the lettering had been inked,
apparently by hand.  While such a thing was hardly unknown to her, being quite
proficient in the art of calligraphy herself from a solid decade of inking her
own spiritual wards, she knew what kind of effort would have to have been put
into writing such a long composition.
     Her grandfather remained silent as he read, seeming to study the ink with
deliberate caution as his eyes went from one word to the next.  He began to
drift back towards the fire, never taking his eyes off the parchment as he sat
down in his original position.  He paused for a brief moment to lift his head
up and glance over his shoulder, sighing quietly and making a brief gesture to
the empty air next to him.
     The monk bowed his head in acknowledgement before he stepped into the
residence and moved to sit down as indicated.  His dark eyes seemed to sweep
across the room for a brief instant before seeming to study Rei in silence,
turning his gaze back to her grandfather after a few moments.
     The chill in Rei&#39;s blood had tripled when the monk looked at her, but had
just as quickly settled back down once his focus had turned away.  Between the
eerie calmness of the monk and the deliberately concealed emotions of her
grandfather, she was getting the distinct impression that something unsavory
was either happening or was going to happen soon.  Despite her unease, however,
she continued to remain in a meditative position and tried to focus as best she
could on maintaining an outwardly neutral composure.
     It seemed a minor eternity had passed before her grandfather made a noise,
a barely-audible hissing sound as he inhaled deeply to speak.  &quot;I presume that
you speak for the Tulku in regards to this.... exchange?&quot; he said quietly in a
voice that betrayed no hint of his mood.
     The monk bowed his head slightly in reply.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he said.  &quot;He said to
emphasize the fact that the one is not linked to the other in the slightest.
He is prepared to send her here even if you do not agree to an exchange, and
the offer of compensation will likewise remain unaltered.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; the old man said, lifting his head up from the parchment to look at
the monk.  &quot;And why would he do that?&quot; he inquired in a neutral tone.
     The monk seemed to take a moment to choose his words carefully before
replying.  &quot;I believe his Holiness does not think that your.... disagreement
will have any bearing on this particular issue.  I doubt that he would have
contemplated making such an offer to you if he had even the slightest reason to
believe that you would mistreat her in any fashion.  Consider also the fact
that you have spent sixteen years raising your.... granddaughter by yourself,&quot;
he added, again hesitating just slightly as he spoke.  &quot;That by itself speaks
much for your patience, tolerance, and capacity to teach others, which has not
escaped the Tulku&#39;s attention in spite of your continued silence.&quot;
     &quot;Even now he continues to spy on me?&quot; the old man said in a soft tone that
carried a very subtle but equally distinctive edge to it.
     The monk shook his head gently.  &quot;The clouds in your mind are your own,&quot;
he said calmly.  &quot;Just as they have always been.  I do not expect you to truly
believe me, but we both know perception has little bearing on reality.&quot;
     &quot;And the girl?&quot; the old man prodded in a leery tone.
     &quot;A student,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;Just as you once were and as it is hoped
that Rei will decide to become,&quot; he added as he turned to look at her.  &quot;As I
said earlier, I have a message for you from his Holiness, the Tulku,&quot; he said
as he held out the second scroll case to her.
     &quot;Leave Rei out of this,&quot; her grandfather said in a flat tone, his dark
eyes seeming to flare just slightly with a hidden anger.
     For one moment, it appeared that the monk might have sighed to himself.
&quot;If you had read the Tulku&#39;s letter to you, then you will know all of what he
has to say to Rei,&quot; he said calmly, still holding out the scroll case.  &quot;In any
case, I am simply here to deliver the message and return with a reply if any is
to be given.&quot;
     Rei regarded him very carefully, still highly unsure about what to do in
the quite but tense situation.  A quick glance at her grandfather&#39;s face gave
her no answers, seeing only a tightly veiled mask of impassiveness that was of
very scant comfort.  She glanced back at the monk for a few moments before she
carefully leaned forward, reaching out to take the offered case.
     She blinked hard as her grandfather grabbed it before she could, reaching
through the fire itself to pluck the wooden casing from the monk.  He sat back
a moment later, giving her a clear look of warning before rolling up his letter
and setting it aside.  The seal was broken as easily as the first one had been
and the lid flipped open without so much as a blink from the monk, suggesting
that he either had been expecting such a move or possessed a truly incredible
amount of tolerance and patience.
     Rei sighed quietly to herself and stared into the fire, knowing that her
grandfather was being extremely protective of her for a very good reason.  This
is crazy, she thought to herself as she realized that this really was the first
time she could remember ever seeing him act this way.  She had the feeling that
he and the Shaolin monk knew one another from somewhere, most likely in the
past long before she was born, but it still bothered her greatly to see him
becoming upset like this.  Bah, too much more of this and I&#39;ll end up wishing
I was dealing with Negaverse troubles again, she thought dourly.  At least I
know how to handle them....
     &quot;I want Rei left out of this,&quot; the old man finally spoke up, his voice
tainted by a faint edge of steel.  &quot;You may tell the Tulku that I will give the
first question a proper amount of consideration before sending a reply, but I
will not allow my granddaughter to become involved in any of this.&quot;
     &quot;If that is to be your reply, I shall tell his Holiness upon my return,&quot;
the monk replied calmly.  &quot;However, I have been instructed to obtain a reply
from Rei as well, and that it is to be with her own voice regardless of what
she may decide to say or how.&quot;
     The old man lifted his head up from the second scroll and glared at the
impassive face next to him.  &quot;And if I refuse?&quot; he inquired in an ominous tone.
     &quot;Then you refuse,&quot; the monk said simply.  &quot;However, and I say this in my
own voice and not the Tulku&#39;s, I don&#39;t think you will.  I have long understood
the nature of your disagreement with his Holiness and all that has become of it
since.  While I obviously do not agree with your views, I doubt that you have
changed that much over the years that you would ultimately turn your back on
the core of the beliefs that we still share.  You know what is being asked of
her here, more so than I myself do, and neither myself nor his Holiness would
ever speak out against you for acting according to your conscience.  We both
know that this is a shared choice, and we both know it would be unjust for one
to be denied the right to their choice without their consent.  Even if the
denial is due to a shroud of ignorance clouding the mind,&quot; he added calmly.
     Rei&#39;s grandfather sighed quietly to himself and looked back down at the
scrolls, holding the side-by-side for comparison.  He continued to study them
very carefully before rolling up the second one and leaning forward, holding
out the parchment-wrapped bamboo to Rei in silence.
     She gave him a very uneasy look as she accepted the scroll from him and
unrolled it, quickly flipping it around once she realized she was holding it
upside-down.  The glow of the fire seemed to penetrate the bottom of the odd
parchment, giving the black ink imprinted on it a faintly golden glow as she
began to read the delicate calligraphy.

                *               *               *               *

Rei -

  I bid you greetings from the Order of Light.  I am known as the Tulku, the
master teacher of our holy temple in Tibet, China.  I doubt you know of me,
given the remoteness of our Order, but I know of you and of the fire that burns
in your heart.  You have a natural gift for spiritual energy, and I know that
you have sought for ways to further improve your inner powers.  I can instruct
you in our arts if you are willing to become my student, as your Grandfather
himself once was.  This is not an offer that is made often or extended lightly,
and I ask that you please consider it most carefully.  I know that you have a
great number of questions now, more so than ever.  As you are now aware of
this, your Grandfather will likely answer some of your questions, though many
will still be beyond his capacity to answer even if he had the desire to do so.
It is my hope that I will be able to help you find the rest of your answers
should you accept.  As a quick answer is neither wise nor expected, I do not
expect to hear from you at this time aside from a simple acknowledgement of
receipt of this letter.  Should you reach a decision at some point in the near
future, your Grandfather will know how and where to contact me with your reply.
Please give my regards to your friends, as I know how much of a pillar of
strength they have become for you in your darkest hours.  Had we all the same
guardian angels in our lives as you seem to have in yours, this world would
truly be a realm of Light.  I look forward to hearing from you one day.


                                                      Peace Be With You,
                                                      The Tulku


                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Grandpa....&quot; Rei started to say in a very quiet voice.
     &quot;We will speak later,&quot; he said in a neutral tone.  &quot;After dinner.  And
after both your chores and your homework are done,&quot; he added sternly.
     Rei blinked hard and gave him a classic &#39;you have to be kidding me&#39; look,
but otherwise simply nodded in acquiescence.  To say that she was curious about
what he might have to say about this was a vast understatement, but she knew
that he was also simply being practical about the situation.  They still had a
temple to maintain, after all, and the work could only be put off for so long
before it *had* to be done or there would be unpleasant consequences for the
way they lived.  The gift store paid for itself and then some, but they still
lived mostly on the donations of visitors and worshippers, and in order to keep
that money coming they had to keep the place presentable and peaceful.
     &quot;Just think of it as added incentive,&quot; he added with a very faint laugh.
It was hard for her to tell if it was a natural laugh or simply an emotional
facade put on for her benefit.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rei muttered, more out of a reflex than anything.
     &quot;Rei,&quot; the monk said quietly.  He waited until she looked back over at him
before continuing, &quot;The Tulku has asked me to convey to him what your initial
thoughts are on the matter, regardless of what they may be.  There are, of
course, a number of questions that you will have to have answered to your
satisfaction before you decide whether to accept or not, but I still ask that
you share with me what you are thinking right now.&quot;
     Rei blinked and cast a questioning look at her grandfather, feeling a
faint chill form in her abdomen as he stared back at her with a perfectly
unreadable expression before finally nodding to her.  &quot;Truthfully?&quot; she said
aloud as she glanced down at the parchment, slowly reading it again.  &quot;This
bothers me.&quot;
     &quot;How so?&quot; the monk inquired calmly, seeming to tilt his head just slightly
as he focused on her.
     &quot;He claims to know me,&quot; Rei said slowly.  &quot;And I doubt it is from talking
to my grandfather.&quot;
     The monk simply nodded in acknowledgement.  &quot;And what else?&quot; he asked.
     &quot;It&#39;d be nice to have some details,&quot; she added.  &quot;What exactly I would be
studying, where, when, and for how long.  I&#39;ve still got school to attend here,
so it&#39;s not like I can skip a month or three on a whim.&quot;
     The monk nodded his head again.  &quot;I believe your grandfather can explain
that better than I can, having been a student of his Holiness as well,&quot; he
replied.  &quot;I believe his Holiness understands the concerns of timing and your
formal state-sponsored education, but I will mention it when I return.  It is
my personal view that you would not be asked to travel until the spring season,
as the winter months typically result in a very harsh environment that is far
less forgiving than even the strictest of our teachers.&quot;
     Rei cast a quick glance at her grandfather as he grunted quietly, seeming
to be staring into the firepit with a slightly haunted look on his face.  &quot;And
this temple would be in Tibet, right?&quot; she inquired with just the faintest hint
of wariness to her voice.
     &quot;It is,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;You would, of course, need to apply for a
passport and visa permit to travel through China, but that can be taken care of
at the appropriate time.  Unless you have any objections, Rei, I shall tell his
Holiness that you are open to his offer.&quot;
     &quot;Conditionally,&quot; her grandfather spoke up in a flat voice.
     &quot;If I may,&quot; the monk said, his normally calm voice seeming to take on a
faint suggestion of humor, &quot;That much was understood in the beginning.&quot;
     The old man muttered something very quietly to himself that Rei wasn&#39;t
able to hear.  She had the feeling that it wasn&#39;t in a language she could have
understood anyway, but she nonetheless received the impression that it wasn&#39;t
exactly a polite comment.  He sighed quietly as he stared into the fire before
he finally lifted his head up to look at her.
     &quot;Rei, you might want to get on with the studying,&quot; he suggested in a calm
and reserved tone, making to clear that it wasn&#39;t a suggestion at all.  &quot;As I
said, we will speak more of this tonight after dinner.  Providing, of course,
you make enough progress on your science studies,&quot; he added with a soft laugh
of honest humor.
     What might have been a faint grumble of protest started to rise up from
Rei&#39;s throat, only to be quashed before it could be heard by anyone else.  She
knew a dismissal when she heard one, and the jab about her less-than-stellar
grades was only in half-jest.  She permitted herself the softest of sighs as
she rolled up the parchment and rose to her feet in silence, giving them both
a slight bow of her head before wordlessly leaving the room.
     &quot;The Tulku warned me that you had changed,&quot; the monk said quietly in a
quiet, almost musical sub-dialect of Mandarin Chinese.  &quot;But I must confess I
had not thought you would have become so.... embittered.&quot;
     &quot;We all change over time,&quot; the old man replied in the same language as he
closed his eyes.  &quot;You know why I left, and you know why there can be no sort
of reconciliation.  Do not waste my time or yours on it further.&quot;
     The monk bowed his head in acknowledgement.  &quot;And Rei?&quot; he inquired.  &quot;I
mean no disrespect, of course, but even I can see that she is not your....&quot;
     &quot;I would not say anything further I were you,&quot; the old man interrupted in
a very soft tone that would have chilled the blood of a psychopath.  &quot;Rei is my
granddaughter and I am her grandfather, and that is the end of it.  I&#39;m sure
the Tulku understands this quite clearly, even if you do not.&quot;
     The monk was silent for a number of moments, absently staring into the
burning heart of the fire as he sorted his thoughts.  &quot;Very well,&quot; he finally
said quietly.  &quot;Are you aware of the extent of her potential?&quot;
     The old man snorted quietly to himself.  &quot;I knew the day she came here,&quot;
he replied.  &quot;I may have a clouded mind, as you claim, but I can still see.
And I&#39;m sure the Tulku&#39;s vision isn&#39;t limited to what is in front of him,&quot; he
added in a darkly ironic tone.  &quot;I.... will admit to wondering sometimes when
someone from the Order would show up to try to take her from me, and seeing you
here today disturbs me greatly.&quot;
     &quot;It is not the Tulku&#39;s intention to take Rei from you,&quot; the monk countered
quietly. 
     The old man snorted quietly.  &quot;And what is his intention?&quot;
     &quot;To train Rei in the arts and return her to you,&quot; was the calm answer.
&quot;His Holiness does not share his visions with me often, but he has said enough
to suggest that he knows Rei&#39;s destiny and will not interfere with it.  All he
seeks is to teach her and open up new doors of opportunity that would otherwise
remain closed.  Much, as I suspect, as he has done with you.&quot;
     A truly bitter snort rose up from the old man&#39;s chest.  &quot;And that is
precisely what has me worried,&quot; he replied, looking up to level a glare at the
monk.  &quot;Bad enough I had to experience that, now he wants to do the same to Rei
as well?&quot;
     The monk sighed very quietly and looked into the fire.  &quot;I was never a
student of his Holiness,&quot; he reminded the other man.  &quot;I know of the art and
the training it entails, but I lack the first-hand knowledge of the ordeal.&quot;
     &quot;I know,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather replied curtly, &quot;Which is why I&#39;m not going to
waste my breath trying to explain the magnitude of what the Tulku is asking.
You say you understand my side of the argument, but until you learn how to see
past the clouds in your own mind I will not place much value on your words.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; the monk said quietly.  &quot;May I ask what your thoughts are on
the other half of the exchange?&quot;
     The old man remained quiet as he picked up the lengthy scroll and began to
read it again.  &quot;Rei said it well enough,&quot; he finally murmured after a full
minute of silence.  &quot;This bothers me.  Why does he ask this?&quot;
     &quot;I speak for myself and not the Tulku when I say this,&quot; the monk replied
in a subdued tone, &quot;But I believe that he is.... uncertain of what else to do.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; the other man replied as a very surprised look crossed his face.
     &quot;The situation is complex, possibly even more than I can follow,&quot; was the
calm reply.  &quot;Before his Holiness brought Taki to the temple, we had never had
a female student before.  His inclusion of her into the Order, while not being
against written law, caused no small amount of.... disconcertion among many.
Balance was eventually restored without undue pain or dishonor, and I honestly
believe that everyone is now far more enlightened because of it, but the first
few months were not easy on anyone.&quot;
     &quot;And now you don&#39;t know what to do with her, do you?&quot; the old man said in
a very uneasy tone.  &quot;A student is one thing, but if she has completed her
training to the Tulku&#39;s satisfaction and is a member of the Order of Light....&quot;
     The monk dipped his head slightly.  &quot;Again, these are my thoughts and not
those of his Holiness, but you seem to have raised Rei quite successfully and
without outside assistance.  Perhaps you can further guide Taki&#39;s steps as she
continues on her path to womanhood, just as you are doing with Rei.&quot;
     A very dry chuckle rose up from the old man&#39;s chest.  &quot;I take it the opium
harvests this year were exceptional?&quot; he drawled.  &quot;If the Tulku has taken up
the fine art of drug usage, that might explain his &#39;vision&#39; about this one.&quot;
     &quot;Master Wen....&quot; the monk started to say.
     The old man waved him off with a curt gesture.  &quot;Does the Tulku honestly
think he can just dump his problems on my doorstep like this?&quot; he spat.
     &quot;Did he say that in his letter to you?&quot; the monk countered calmly.  &quot;From
what he told me, the plan was for Taki to remain here as your student and aide
while Rei is taught the arts.  That will not leave your temple unattended or
lacking as she will assume Rei&#39;s duties.  Once Rei returns to you, Taki will
then return to the Order for another assignment.  If you were of the mind that
this exchange would be permanent, then I must apologize for not explaining it
properly.&quot;
     Rei&#39;s grandfather grunted very softly to himself, realizing that he had
indeed misread the situation.  &quot;So what about what you said about the two not
being linked?&quot; he inquired.
     &quot;The Tulku wishes two things, for Taki to be your student for a time and
for Rei to be his student for a time,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;He felt it would be
best for both to occur at the same time, simply because he knows how important
it is for your temple to be maintained and that you will have a difficult time
if you are forced to do it alone due to Rei&#39;s absence.  Taki&#39;s primary purpose
will be to assume Rei&#39;s role in maintaining things, and the offer of a stipend
is to ensure that she will in no way be a burden on your resources.&quot;
     The old man grunted quietly again as he glanced down at the inked scroll,
his eyes scanning the delicate characters until he found the proposed value of
the stipend.  It was far from a trivial amount, and in fact openly bordered on
stunning in size.  &quot;I was not aware that the Order had become so enriched that
it could offer such a sum as a stipend for a travelling monk,&quot; he said, keeping
his voice as neutral as possible.
     &quot;Change over the years is not limited to people,&quot; the monk pointed out in
a tone that might have been taken by some as a gentle rebuke.  &quot;You do not need
to.... if you will forgive me, worry yourself on our account.&quot;
     The old man paused and blinked before looking up from the scroll to find
a faintly bemused look on the monk&#39;s face.  &quot;A joke, Wu?  You of all people?&quot;
     The monk merely bowed his head slightly, the faint ghost of a smile still
touching his lips.  &quot;There is a time and place for everything,&quot; he reminded the
other man.  &quot;As to the stipend, his Holiness knows that you are not greedy or
wasteful and that anything left over after seeing to Rei and Taki&#39;s needs will
be put to productive use.  For example, I have noticed several spiritual wards
have been set into place, but that their energies are.... tired.&quot;
     A soft grunt rose up from the old man&#39;s chest, knowing precisely what the
monk was referring to.  It was obvious to anyone who could sense spiritual
energy that the temple resided on consecrated land and was surrounded by more
than a few defensive wards, but it had been a number of years since he had been
able to afford the necessary materials to reinforce the holy bindings and have
the land reconsecrated.  There was still more than enough spiritual energy left
to continue to repel evil influences, but he was also aware of the occasional
transgression by darkened spirits.  They rarely stayed for long and to his
knowledge never did any damage to anyone or anything, but it was still enough
to disturb his meditations some nights thinking about what they were and what
it ultimately meant....
     &quot;Tell me about this student of the Tulku&#39;s,&quot; he finally said as he tried
to clear his thoughts and refocus on the current situation.
     &quot;I would if I knew much about her,&quot;  the monk replied, prompting a blink
of surprise from the other man.  &quot;Taki does not speak to anyone unless spoken
to first, save for when his Holiness instructs her to speak her thoughts, and
even then she guards her words in the presence of others.  If she speaks freely
to his Holiness, he has not indicated such to me.&quot;
     &quot;Not at all surprising,&quot; the old man commented absently as he stared into
the firepit before closing his eyes.  &quot;He has always guarded the secrets of
others in silence, I wouldn&#39;t expect him to start speaking now.  Surely there
is something you can tell me about her, though,&quot; he prompted.
     &quot;Only her outward appearance,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;I would guess that she
is a year or two older than Rei, and having finally seen your granddaughter for
myself, I can say that it is not unlike seeing a reflection in a pond.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; the old man said as he opened his eyes again.  &quot;How so?&quot;
     &quot;A first glance might suggest they are related,&quot; was the calm reply.  &quot;I
know nothing of either woman, so I would not immediately dismiss the notion of
their sharing of a common ancestor in recent memory.&quot;
     The old man snorted quietly in dismissal.  &quot;I doubt it,&quot; he murmured.
     &quot;How much do you know about your granddaughter?&quot; the monk inquired softly.
He waited in patience for a reply that he knew would never come, nodding his
head slowly after a few moments to indicate he understood.  &quot;As I said, this
appears to be a very complex situation that his Holiness has set up, and I do
not believe it to be an accident.&quot;
     &quot;I am aware of how skilled a thread-weaver the Tulku is,&quot; the old man said
very quietly.  &quot;Regardless of which, I would know more about this Taki before
I invite her to live with me as a student.&quot;
     &quot;She is a model student,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;She has never disobeyed an
instruction nor misbehaved in the slightest, as she seems to value her sense of
honor above all else.  She has only asked one thing of us during the entire
course of her training, and that was to be permitted to keep her sword with her
at all times.  She agreed to have it bound so that it could not be drawn, which
is why the Tulku permitted it.  Other than that, there is nothing else to be
said of her.&quot;
     &quot;A sword?&quot; the old man echoed, giving the monk a studious look.  &quot;Do you
happen to know what kind, by chance?&quot;
     The monk merely shook his head.  &quot;I am not a weaponsmith.&quot;
     &quot;Describe it, then,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather suggested.
     &quot;The scabbard is this long,&quot; the monk replied, holding his arms a fair
distance apart.  &quot;And the hilt spans this much.  I have not seen the blade,
but there is a slight curve to the scabbard that suggests the blade has such a
curve as well.&quot;
     &quot;Color?  Decorations?  Carvings on the hilt?&quot; the old man persisted.
     &quot;The scabbard is black and unadorned,&quot; the monk said calmly.  &quot;The hilt
was bound with a black silk cord and slung with another length of black silk.
The hilt seemed to likewise be gripped with black silk and woven with fine gold
strands as one might bind hair.  There might have been some detail engraved on
the hilt beneath the grip, but I never got close enough to see.&quot;
     The monk remained sitting perfectly still, watching in idle interest as
the old man rose to his feet and silently left the room.  He returned a moment
later holding the sheathed sword that was part of the collection that hung on
his bedroom wall.  &quot;A sword like this?&quot; he inquired as he sat down and held out
the scabbard.
     &quot;It is similar,&quot; the monk replied, not moving to touch the weapon.
     &quot;A katana, then,&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather murmured as he set the ancient weapon
next to him and stared into the fire.  &quot;Interesting.&quot;
     &quot;Indeed, these are becoming interesting times,&quot; the monk commented in a
faintly amused tone.  The barest hint of a smile touched his face as the old
man began to chuckle softly to himself.
     &quot;More humor, Wu?&quot; Rei&#39;s grandfather said.  &quot;You should be careful with
that sort of thing, it could get you into all kinds of trouble.&quot;
     &quot;If only it were humor, I might find it amusing as well,&quot; the monk said,
causing the old man&#39;s chuckles to fade away.  &quot;As I said, the situation is very
complex right now, and I know that I know very little about it.  All the Tulku
has said to me is that he desires for Taki to be placed in your service for a
period of time, and that he would prefer that Rei be trained in the arts for
her own benefit.&quot;
     The old man sighed and picked up the message scroll again, letting his
eyes move from one inked character to the next with deliberate slowness.  &quot;Just
for the sake of discussion,&quot; he said slowly after a fair amount of silence,
&quot;Let&#39;s say that I agree to have Taki come here for awhile.  How much advanced
notice would have to be given?&quot;
     &quot;She can be in-country within twenty-four hours of your approval,&quot; the
monk said calmly, drawing a startled look from the other man.
     &quot;That is.... surprisingly fast,&quot; he said in an uneasy tone.  &quot;I would have
thought that Beijing would take a few days to scrutinize everything first.&quot;
     &quot;She is a Japanese citizen,&quot; the monk replied.  &quot;Customs will only delay
her to inquire about the sword, and the government permits from both China and
Japan have already been obtained.  The only delay is making the actual flight
arrangements.&quot;
     &quot;Wu?&quot; the old man said in a tired tone as he rubbed his face.  &quot;Surely you
could have mentioned her citizenship when I asked about her earlier.  Do I even
want to ask how she became part of the Order?&quot;
     The monk made a slight gesture of dismissal.  &quot;You presume I know,&quot; he
replied calmly.  &quot;Taki&#39;s story is her own to tell if she wishes it, as it is
not for me to say in any case.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; the old man sighed.  &quot;As I said, you may tell the Tulku that
I will give it the consideration it deserves.&quot;
     &quot;And as for Rei?&quot; the monk prompted carefully.
     &quot;I have strong reservations against the notion, but in deference to Rei&#39;s
wishes I will not immediately forbid it,&quot; was the quiet reply.  &quot;She and I will
discuss it tonight, however, so you may have a different answer come sunrise.&quot;
     The monk bowed his head before he slowly rose to his feet.  &quot;I will see
that your words are conveyed to his Holiness,&quot; he promised calmly.  &quot;And I do
thank you for your hospitality.&quot;
     The old man waved a hand absently.  &quot;A common courtesy, nothing more, so
don&#39;t read too much into it.  Time changes many things, but it still hasn&#39;t
changed my desire to have nothing more to do with the Order of Light.  Or those
who still serve it,&quot; he added in a faintly edged tone.
     &quot;I thank you for your hospitality anyway,&quot; the monk replied calmly.
     The old man snorted quietly to himself.  &quot;Enjoy the flight home,&quot; he said,
mostly to himself.  He didn&#39;t look up from the fire as the monk bowed and left
in near-perfect silence, betrayed only by the slightest of whisperings as his
orange-and-yellow robes brushed the edge of the door as he exited the building.
     It took them long enough, he thought to himself as he glanced down at his
side.  The sheathed katana was a good three hundred years old, given to him by
the Shinto priest who had been the original caretaker of the temple.  The dark
memories started to return and replay themselves in his mind before he abruptly
dispelled them, forcing them to return to the corner of his mind where he had
largely kept them quietly locked away.
     &quot;So the first thread finally becomes unbound from the tapestry,&quot; he said
very softly to the weapon as he picked it up.  &quot;It has held for sixteen years,
and I had hoped it would have held longer, but no matter.  Interesting times,
indeed,&quot; he said as he started to laugh quietly once again.  The very soft and
bitter sound remained with him as he stood up, taking the ancient sword with
him.  He returned it to its proper place on his bedroom wall before turning his
attention back to the world around him, knowing that he would indeed have to
have a long talk with Rei about the matter and that a few questions would be
asked that he would rather not have to answer.  And if that wasn&#39;t enough, he&#39;d
also need to decide if he could handle having two teenagers in the temple.
     It was an old and somewhat traditional Chinese curse that went, &#39;May you
live in interesting times.&#39;  And he was painfully aware that things had just
gotten *very* interesting indeed....

                *               *               *               *

     The world swirled madly around Rune in a blur for what seemed to be an
eternity before everything suddenly snapped into crystal-clear and distinctly
painful focus.  The first thing her senses were able to process was the smell,
the unmistakably heavy scent that lingered in the air after a solid downpouring
of rain.  The fact that she was completely soaked to her underwear registered
an instant later, producing a reflexive shiver that quickly became a full-body
tremor as the chill took hold.
     &quot;Oh, *ICK!*&quot; someone groaned as the group slowly became aware of their
surroundings following the collapse of the overmind mesh.
     &quot;Everyone stay still, please,&quot; Master Healer Maq&#39;i instructed as she made
a sharp gesture to her aide.  A few simple words into a comm-link resulted in
the terrace door opening up, allowing the swarm of waiting medical technicians
to scurry out with heated blankets.
     &quot;Ow.... my.... head....&quot; Tempest whimpered quietly as she gingerly rose to
her feet and was promptly enveloped in a deliciously warm blanket.
     Al&#39;vexi just sighed and rubbed her face, apparently unfazed by the surge
of psionic energy that had resulted from the dissolution of the mental union.
&quot;The pain will fade in a few moments, Lieutenant,&quot; she said in an unusually
brittle voice.  &quot;The rest of you should remain seated and let the healers take
care of matters for the moment, as I suspect we are all suffering from a mild
case of Chaos drain right now.&quot;
     &quot;I know I am,&quot; Alani sighed quietly, not having bothered to open her eyes
yet.  &quot;Ohh, that feels good,&quot; she cooed as she was all but buried in a mass of
heated fabric by a medic.
     &quot;You can still feel?&quot; A&#39;del muttered darkly as she tried to focus on the
darkened sky.  &quot;My ptanka is numb, and I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s just a stray icicle I
feel inside my shirt.  Otherwise, I&#39;m in trouble.... HEY!&quot; she protested as she
felt a finger slip into her collar and tug her tunic down a few inches.
     &quot;That&#39;s just your necklace you&#39;re feeling,&quot; the medic said calmly as she
started to rub the telepath down with the heated blanket.  &quot;Metal takes a bit
longer to warm up than skin does.  Tell me again what you were doing?&quot; she
added carefully as she cast an uneasy glance at the crystal structure A&#39;del and
the others were still sitting on.
     &quot;House-cleaning,&quot; Ael&#39;ien grumbled as she probed the front half of her
skull with her fingertips.  She was fairly sure it was completely intact, but
the incessant throbbing feeling was trying to suggest otherwise.  &quot;And if there
is still a coat of paint on anything within a mile of here, we did it wrong.
Ohhh, thank you, that feels warm,&quot; she sighed as another technician started to
cocoon her in a warm blanket.
     &quot;Trust me, I think you did it right,&quot; another medic said to her.
     &quot;Remind me again why I&#39;m soaked?&quot; Rune asked in a mild voice as she too
was enveloped in heated blankets.
     &quot;Blame the overmind,&quot; Tempest grumbled.  She closed her eyes and tried to
summon a heated wind to aid the evaporation process, giving up with a grunt as
she realized that she was simply too drained of energy to stir a breeze of any
sort.  &quot;I&#39;ll bet the Castle got a decent scrubbing out of it, if.... wait, what
was that?&quot; she said in an uneasy tone as an odd sound reached her ears.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Alani said in an openly worried tone, &quot;But I know I felt
it right beneath me.&quot;
     &quot;Rune?&quot; Si&#39;ren prodded carefully as she both heard and felt another odd
vibration coming from the crystal structure.
     &quot;Chaos drain,&quot; Rune said simply as she allowed herself to be gently pulled
into a standing position.  &quot;The crystal energy matrix was emptied of power as
well, so it&#39;s starting to disintegrate and collapse under its own weight.  No
need to panic, it won&#39;t blow up or anything,&quot; she added as she heard no less
than four breaths being sharply sucked in.  &quot;There&#39;s no energy left in it to
explode.  Just let it decay on its own and have someone bring a vacuum out here
in a few hours to clean up what&#39;s left.&quot;
     &quot;Ooof, get me off this thing,&quot; Alani said as she tried to scamper to her
feet.  The sudden change in blood pressure almost caused her to pass out, and
she would have fallen back on her rear if it hadn&#39;t been for the medic holding
on to her elbow.
     &quot;Hey, easy,&quot; the medic protested.  &quot;You&#39;re all suffering from fatigue and
borderline hypothermia.  C&#39;mon, we&#39;ve got orders to take everyone here down to
the medical ward to dry you off and make sure you&#39;re all okay.  Due respect,
ma&#39;am, that includes you flag officers as well,&quot; he added as he noticed the
dark look coming from Rune.
     &quot;I&#39;m the Commander-General,&quot; Rune replied flatly.  &quot;Nobody can give me
orders unless they&#39;re wearing a crown.&quot;
     &quot;They are my orders based on medical authority,&quot; Maq&#39;i said gently.  &quot;You
should come down to the medical ward with us anyway, as we already have dry
uniforms ready for you to change into.  Pa&#39;an Vol, I trust you will not feel
offended if all we can offer you is a robe from our own order?&quot; she added as
she glanced at the monk.
     &quot;In truth, I wouldn&#39;t care if you offered me a dress right now,&quot; Vol said
with a quiet chuckle.  &quot;Just as long as it is drier than what I&#39;m wearing now.&quot;
     &quot;Careful what you wish for, Pa&#39;an,&quot; Rune said absently as she started to
wobble towards the open archway.  Her backside was very much asleep at the
moment, and the bone-deep chill in her muscles wasn&#39;t helping matters either.
She none-too-gently shrugged off the hand that tried to steady her arm and
continued to make her own way inside.  &quot;If this collective effort was as much
of a success as I think it is, you can all look forward to a commendation of
one kind or another.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m honored, Rune,&quot; Al&#39;vexi spoke up dryly.  &quot;But seeing how I&#39;m retired
now, I&#39;ll settle for a very warm cup of ma&#39;cha or two.&quot;
     &quot;Not to be greedy, but can I have both?&quot; Tempest inquired as she started
to limp towards the door, her backside just as stiff and uncooperative as the
rest of the group&#39;s rear ends.  &quot;Ow, ow, this hurts....&quot;
     Maq&#39;i just shook her head to herself as she and the other medical aides
ushered the group into the distinctly warmer environs of the Imperial Castle.
The trip down to the medical wards several levels below was a slow one, but it
gave them an opportunity to loosen stiff muscles and restore circulation to
their extremities.  By the time they arrived in the ward, only Al&#39;vexi and Vol
had minor issues with still-sore posteriors.
     &quot;Oooh, yeah, I can just smell the warmth in that,&quot; Alani purred as the
doors hissed open, bringing with it the strong smell of freshly-brewed ma&#39;cha.
     &quot;You all need to change first,&quot; Maq&#39;i instructed firmly.  &quot;Dry uniforms
are over there, and you can put the wet ones in the bin in the corner.&quot;
     &quot;Sir, if you&#39;ll come with me?&quot; a male medic said as he guided Vol over to
a small curtained-off area where he could change in relative privacy.
     The rest of the group barely glanced at one another before they began to
strip off their tunics, prompting the quiet and unobtrusive departure of the
rest of the male medical staff.  The remaining female staff members started to
bring more heated blankets and towels over to the group, seeking to offer them
some modicum of privacy as they stripped.
     &quot;I don&#39;t suppose the Navy uniforms are more water-resistant than this?&quot;
Ael&#39;ien inquired absently as she had to literally peel her undertunic off of
her skin.
     &quot;I wish,&quot; Si&#39;ren grumbled as she finished stripping to the waist.  &quot;The
only difference I&#39;ve ever noticed between uniforms is that ours tends to float
better in sea-water.&quot;
     A&#39;del made a soft sound to herself as she struggled to remove her boots
without falling over.  &quot;Wonder who they found to test that one,&quot; she muttered.
She paused as a thought occurred her and glanced over at Si&#39;ren only to quickly
look away from the bare-breasted admiral.  &quot;Or was that the voice of experience
talking, ma&#39;am?&quot; she ventured with a faint green blush.
     &quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; Si&#39;ren muttered as she began to work the fastenings of her
thoroughly-soaked pants.  Everyone jumped slightly as a comm-link chittered
loudly, prompting a very dark curse from her once she realized that it was her
comm-link that was going off.  She did her best to finish the task of removing
her pants as fast she could without falling over.  The device chittered twice
more before she finally could pluck it off of her belt and thumb the channel
open.  &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; she said as she started to peel her underwear off.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, this is Operations duty officer with a situational status report,&quot;
the male voice said calmly, completely oblivious to her state of undress.  That
was to be expected of a voice-only communication, of course, but the feeling of
exposure wasn&#39;t something that could be easily dismissed.
     Si&#39;ren paused and gave the rest of the group a look of remote unamusement
at the current situation.  &quot;Go ahead,&quot; she said warily as she quickly turned
her focus to the comm-link.  The nude female body didn&#39;t faze her in the least,
and like a small percentage of women she actively appreciated the toned and
youthful bodies that Alani and Tempest had.  By the same token, however, she
was more than a little disconcerted to see an aged woman like Al&#39;vexi in a
state of near-total undress.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, the surrounding radiation field appears to have been completely
removed,&quot; the male voice said.  &quot;The regional communication networks are in the
process of being taken down for an attempted synchronous restart.  The logic
behind this is that such a coordinated restart will take less time to complete
than a node-by-node synchronization and rebuilding of the network.  The nets
should be regenerated in approximately six minutes.&quot;
     &quot;Excellent,&quot; the soaked admiral replied.  She frowned slightly as she was
enveloped in a warm towel and briskly rubbed down by a medic, the sensation
momentarily disrupting her concentration.  &quot;As soon as the channels are clear,
contact General Olox and inform him of our current status.  If the radiation
hazard is negated and communications fully restored, we should be ready to
reassume global command shortly.&quot;
     &quot;Copy, ma&#39;am,&quot; the voice assured her.  &quot;Operations out.&quot;
     &quot;Umm, excuse me....&quot; Alani suddenly spoke up in a very uneasy tone.  She
was looking down at the small stack of dry clothes one of the medical aides had
handed her, her cheeks turning a very bright shade of blue-green.  The cause of
her embarrassment was made obvious a moment later as she very gingerly picked
up a pair of panties that was somewhere in between frilly and racy.
     The medical aide blinked and glanced around uneasily before leaning close
to the Field Sergeant.  &quot;We had to get clean uniforms from your quarters,&quot; she
explained quietly.  &quot;That included undergarments as well, but we didn&#39;t want to
intrude any more than was absolutely necessary.  Those were all that we could
find in a quick search, and we didn&#39;t want to rifle through everything.&quot;
     &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, Sergeant,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up as the rest of the
group all glanced away from Alani as her blush quadrupled in intensity.  &quot;I&#39;m
sure that everyone has worn something beneath their uniforms at one point or
another for comfort value that wasn&#39;t what you would call standard-issue.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am.  Thank you, ma&#39;am,&quot; Alani mumbled in reply, clearly still too
embarrassed to think of anything else to say.  She briefly glanced around the
room and somehow managed to blush even harder before quickly slipping her
panties on and all but leaping into her pants.
     Rune raised an eyebrow at the casualness of Si&#39;ren&#39;s comment.  &quot;Anything
you want to share with us, Admiral?&quot; she prodded carefully as she continued to
dry herself off with a towel.
     Si&#39;ren paused and regarded Rune carefully.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure about the exact
date you started military service, but when I enrolled in the Naval Academy the
type of underwear issued to female cadets was notorious for chafing in a number
of very tender spots, and I&#39;m told the male issue was only marginally better.
Suffice it to say that very few instructors bothered to reprimand anyone for
non-standard underwear so long as it wasn&#39;t obvious or outlandish.  I take it
that amuses you, Lieutenant?&quot; she added coolly as she noticed the smirk on
Tempest&#39;s face.
     &quot;The anecdote, of course not,&quot; Tempest replied as she pointedly held up a
bra that definitely wasn&#39;t military-gray.  &quot;I know the Navy uses a different
contractor for issued clothing than the Army, but I&#39;m sure we all know what you
mean about stock issue tending to chafe.  With all due respect, ma&#39;am, I think
General Rune was looking for something amusing like a story about reporting for
duty with a thong beneath the uniform or something.&quot;
     &quot;I work for the Navy, not Hospitality,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied dryly, prompting a
series of quiet chuckles from both the group and the medical staff.  &quot;And even
if at some point in my youth I did happen to have been wearing something that
had been obviously designed for off-duty activities beneath my on-duty uniform,
I would certainly not be boasting about it in semi-public, even centuries after
the fact.&quot;
     &quot;No sense of adventure, ma&#39;am?&quot; Ael&#39;ien teased her with a grin as she
began to get dressed.  It was fairly obvious that only Al&#39;vexi was making use
of the standard-issue underwear, as she didn&#39;t have personal quarters in the
Imperial Castle for the medical staff to very discreetly obtain dry clothing
from.
     &quot;Not when you reach my age,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out with a faint smile.
     &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; Al&#39;vexi spoke up in a very dry tone.  &quot;I assure you
that age has little to do with it.  Now had you said rank, that I would very
much agree with.  Unless, of course, you really do work for Hospitality, in
which case I&#39;m not sure the dress code even applies anymore.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you have something like Alani&#39;s underwear in your closet,&quot;
Rune said in a very amused tone, causing the young Sergeant to blush hard once
again.  The general blinked hard as she got a distinctly frosty stare in return
from the retired telepath.
     &quot;That, Rune, doesn&#39;t even deserve the dignity of a response,&quot; Al&#39;vexi said
in a level tone as she buttoned her pants and tugged out the wrinkles.
     One of the medical technicians who didn&#39;t appear to be much older than
Alani very discreetly leaned over to the young Field Sergeant.  &quot;If you don&#39;t
mind my asking.... where did you get that, anyway?&quot; she whispered.
     Alani blinked and cast a sidelong glance at the rest of the half-undressed
group before whispering back, &quot;Hospitality&#39;s quartermaster.  She gets a lot of
stuff from the civilian markets and has service catalogs for everything.  And
I mean everything,&quot; she added with noticeable emphasis.
     The group looked over their collective shoulders as a single unit when the
main doors for the medical ward hissed open, framing an Imperial Guard Captain
in the now-open archway.  She took one look inside the ward before she turned
to her side to address more guards who where out of immediate view.
     &quot;Stand post here,&quot; T&#39;shal instructed crisply.  &quot;This area is off-limits
until I say otherwise, and that includes you two.  Nobody in or out until I say
so,&quot; she added before she stepped just far enough into the room to be clear the
sensor&#39;s detection field.  The doors hissed shut behind her with a muted thump
that seemed to echo slightly in the sudden silence.
     &quot;So much for privacy,&quot; Rune muttered darkly, still naked to the waist.
     &quot;Security override,&quot; T&#39;shal replied in a matter-of-fact tone.  &quot;It wasn&#39;t
intentional, I assure you.  Ma&#39;am,&quot; she added to Si&#39;ren with a slight bow of
her head, not seeming to be fazed by the admiral&#39;s nudity.
     Si&#39;ren said nothing, knowing precisely why the Imperial Guard Captain had
shown up in the medical ward with a security detail.  It was an unwelcome
reminder of the current situation they were all in, just minus the immediate
threat of the radioactive fallout.  Rune was still under house arrest pending
the investigation of the nuclear missile launch, and Nop&#39;tera&#39;s cloaked carrier
was still somewhere out there with presently-unknown intentions.
     &quot;With all due respect, Captain,&quot; Al&#39;vexi spoke up in an openly weary tone,
&quot;Can this wait for a few minutes?  I assure you that General Rune isn&#39;t going
anywhere, and certainly not in our current condition.&quot;
     T&#39;shal glanced over at Rune to see a neutral look being directed back at
her.  &quot;I have my orders and protocol to follow, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said, not taking
her dark eyes off Rune as she spoke.  &quot;And in this case, neither privacy nor
medical authority supersedes my duty.&quot;
     &quot;Persistent as always,&quot; Rune said absently as she half-turned away and
finished towelling off her bare chest.
     Si&#39;ren sighed quietly and turned her attention back to her own task of
getting dry and dressed, suddenly mindful of the fact that she was the only one
who had yet to put any clothes back on.  &quot;Sergeant Alani, Ensign A&#39;del, and
Lieutenant Tempest, the three of you are relieved of duty for the remainder of
the day.  I would recommend that you return to your quarters and rest for a
period of time, as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re all still just as Chaos drained as I am.&quot;
     &quot;After each of you are examined,&quot; Maq&#39;i spoke up before anyone else could
draw in a breath to speak.  &quot;Kel, take them into Ward 3 once they&#39;re finished
getting dressed and make sure there aren&#39;t any lingering energy issues.  If
you don&#39;t get an echo-pulse above thirty, they stay here to recover until you
do get such a reading.  Make that thirty-two for Captain Ael&#39;ien, thirty-five
for General Rune and Admiral Si&#39;ren, and forty for both Pa&#39;an Vol and General
Al&#39;vexi.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Al&#39;vexi grumbled to herself as she finished buttoning her tunic.
She placed both hands on the sides of her head and began to focus her psionic
powers, resulting in a visible halo-like splash of energy around her skull.
The effect faded away after a few brief moments, but it was enough to raise the
eyebrows of both Ael&#39;ien and A&#39;del.
     &quot;Wow,&quot; A&#39;del said quietly in open amazement.  &quot;I&#39;ve never been able to
manifest my psi-shields like that.  At least, not without absorbing a very
intense psi-spike in the process.&quot;
     &quot;Practice, Ensign,&quot; the elderly telepath said simply.  &quot;I don&#39;t know if my
energy levels are up to forty on whatever scale the Master Healer mentioned,
but I am certain that the Chaos drain effect was not permanently damaging.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll be here for awhile, then,&quot; Alani muttered sourly as she tugged the
wrinkles out of her uniform.  &quot;It always takes awhile to recover after using my
enhancement powers like that.  I&#39;ll be lucky if it starts working again before
sunrise tomorrow.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren sighed quietly as she tucked the towel completely around her and
eyed the stack of clothes the medical aide had set down on the counter.  It was
nothing more than a spare uniform and clean underwear taken from the topmost
shelf of her dresser, but for some reason she felt slightly hesitant about
putting the uniform back on.  &quot;Rest assured, Sergeant, you will be compensated
for your efforts in the line of duty,&quot; she murmured absently as the studied the
diamond of four silver stars on her uniform shoulders.
     The admiral quickly became lost in introspective thought, her mind briefly
remembering her rise through the ranks to when the four bars of a Commander
were replaced with the silver starburst of a Navy Captain, then later became a
single silver star of a Commodore, then the twin stars of a Lieutenant-Admiral,
then finally the triangle of three stars as a full Admiral.  Being given the
fourth star, the promotion to Fleet Admiral by Queen Beryl, had come as a
complete surprise to her and only long after the novelty had worn off had she
come to realize how truly heavy each successive star had weighed on her mind
and soul.
     &quot;Are you going to stand there all day and drip-dry, Si&#39;ren, or can we get
on to other business?&quot; Rune&#39;s voice intruded into her quiet thoughts, almost
physically snapping her back to her senses.
     &quot;We?&quot; Si&#39;ren said softly as she continued to stare at her uniform.  &quot;You
seem to forget you&#39;re done here, Rune.  If you are that eager to return to your
quarters, then go.  Al&#39;vexi and I will handle matters from here.  Ael&#39;ien,&quot; she
added quietly.  &quot;Division commanders like you and I don&#39;t get to take the rest
of the day off like Sergeants and Lieutenants can simply because of the burden
of duty.  What we can get away with, however, are fairly decent lunch breaks.
I will not expect to see you in the Operations center until half past the
thirteenth hour.  The rest of you are dismissed.&quot;
     She closed her eyes as she heard motion all around her, quiet shuffles of
booted feet as various people left the part of the medical ward she was in.
She heard the hissing of the main door opening, followed by a terse but quiet
command by T&#39;shal to the guard contingent as they escorted Rune away and back
to her house arrest.  An odd silence seemed to fall around her once the doors
closed again, seeming to thump heavily in the hushed air.
     The uniform was still there when she finally opened her eyes again, still
waiting to be put on once more.  Her gaze was drawn back to the cluster of
stars that denoted her rank, seeming to mock her silently as she continued to
study every minute ridge and detail of the emblems.
     &quot;Something on your mind, Si&#39;ren?&quot; Al&#39;vexi said very quietly, her voice
barely more than a whisper and yet still quite loud to the admiral&#39;s ears.
     &quot;What prompted you to retire, Al?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked softly, never once looking
away from the neatly folded uniform.
     &quot;Two factors, really,&quot; the telepath admitted.  &quot;Age being the first, and
general weariness with military politics being the second.  Don&#39;t ask me which
one had the greater impact, as even now it changes from day to day, even in
retrospect.&quot;
     &quot;If I may, General,&quot; Maq&#39;i spoke up softly, startling Si&#39;ren with the
realization that the Master Healer was still with them, &quot;Age is not nearly as
potent a factor as you might think.  Look at me, by all rights I should have
peacefully died in my sleep a century ago, yet I still don&#39;t plan on retiring
anytime soon.&quot;
     &quot;The difference, Master Healer, is that you love your job,&quot; Al&#39;vexi said
in a tone as dry as the Lex&#39;eri desert.  &quot;And speaking of jobs.... not to give
you the impression that I&#39;m prying into your mind, Si&#39;ren, but you need to quit
stalling and get dressed.  Simply put, you can&#39;t retire anytime soon.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a perfectly neutral tone, finally looking away from
the dark blue uniform and casting a sidelong glance at the retired telepath.
     &quot;You&#39;d need to find two replacements,&quot; Al&#39;vexi explained with a slight
note of apology.  &quot;First of all, you&#39;d have to find someone to assume the role
of Central Division commander.  It can&#39;t be me, since I&#39;m retired, and you had
Rune arrested yesterday, so who does that leave?  A one-star Brigadier to fill
a four-star post?  And then what of your position as Fleet Admiral?  You have
yet to appoint an Executive Officer to replace Lieutenant-Admiral Ne&#39;tan, let
alone find someone experienced enough to be your peer.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren simply sighed quietly to herself, acutely aware of just how thin
the naval ranks had become as of late.  Had anyone asked, she would have openly
admitted fast-tracking Ne&#39;tan for promotion to full Admiral and assignment to
replace the ailing commander of the Southern Ocean Fleet who had indicated that
he desired to retire before his health degenerated further.  Given the quiet
admission of his physician that he had less than a century to live, Si&#39;ren saw
it unconscionable to delay or otherwise deny his wishes.  The role could be
temporarily filled by the Commodore who was his executive officer, but Si&#39;ren
knew that she was still awfully young for such a posting....
     &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren, may I offer some advice?&quot; Maq&#39;i spoke up in a very soft
tone, gently bringing Si&#39;ren back out of her introspective thoughts.
     &quot;If you wish,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied absently.  She stared at the folded uniform
and sighed heavily before unwrapping the towel from around her nude body and
setting it aside.  No sense in putting this off any longer, she thought as she
reached for the pair of panties on top of the stack.
     &quot;I am not a member of the military, of course,&quot; Maq&#39;i said in what sounded
to be a fairly delicate tone, &quot;But I think I can offer a solution to some of
the problems that seems to be burdening you and the other command staff.  All
you need to do is travel to Earth, find the Sailor Scouts, and get to know them
as the young individuals they truly are.  I assure you that they are not the
bloodthirsty warrior-women Queen Beryl made them out to be.&quot;
     &quot;And that will solve what, Master Healer?&quot; Al&#39;vexi spoke up when Si&#39;ren
remained oddly silent.
     &quot;You fear them, don&#39;t you?&quot; Maq&#39;i asked quietly.  &quot;Not so much you as an
individual, but the military as an institution.  They are not your enemies, nor
do they wish to be.  They will listen to what you have to say if you approach
them calmly and rationally.  If you can find it within yourself to open up to
Princess Serena, then you will see that you have nothing to fear from her or
her Sailor Scouts.  There can be peace between our worlds, General, and all it
will take on our part is a simple action of inaction.  Do nothing to them or
their world, and they will embrace ours with their human hearts.&quot;
     &quot;Will they?&quot; Si&#39;ren asked in a near-whisper as she clasped her bra.
     &quot;Consider this,&quot; the elderly healer said simply.  &quot;Three of their number
already have very strong feelings towards three denizens, and that Princess
Serena herself is the product of a fourth human-denizen pairing of love.  Yes,
even after all that the Negaverse has done to them and to Earth, they still
look at our world with awe and fascination.  Make peace with the Sailor Scouts,
and you will not have a single worry from Earth again,&quot; Maq&#39;i promised quietly.
     &quot;Master Healer, do you truly believe that Sailor Moon is the half-denizen
daughter of the Dragoon Captain?&quot; Al&#39;vexi asked in a neutral tone.  &quot;A man who
died thousands of years before the Moon Kingdom was even discovered?&quot;
     &quot;Without question,&quot; Maq&#39;i replied firmly without hesitation.
     &quot;That&#39;s enough, Al,&quot; Si&#39;ren said quietly as she buttoned her tunic.  A
simple and efficient tug on the front removed the few wrinkles that had cropped
up from being put on, followed by a truly heavy sigh of resignation.  &quot;If what
Ael&#39;ien says is true, then I&#39;m sure we will have ample opportunity to arrange
for a meeting with Sailor Moon in the near future.  For now, we....&quot;
     The sound of Si&#39;ren&#39;s comm-link chittering for attention could be heard
quite clearly, as was the muttered profanity that was an ancient and rather
obscure reference to what might be done between bored lovers looking to try
something distinctly unorthodox in their search for entertainment.  &quot;Si&#39;ren,&quot;
the Fleet Admiral said a few moments later in a more contemporary denizen
dialect once the device was activated.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, this is Operations duty officer,&quot; a now-familiar male voice said.
&quot;I have a priority message for you from Air Traffic Control North on a secure
circuit that needs your immediate attention.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren looked at the metal cylinder in her hand and sighed quietly before
glancing over at Al&#39;vexi.  &quot;Does this never end?&quot; she asked as she took her
thumb off the transmit switch so her words wouldn&#39;t be carried across the line.
     &quot;It will end eventually,&quot; the telepath replied with a casual shrug.  &quot;Of
course, you&#39;ll either have to die or retire for that to happen, but I assure
you that it ends at some point.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Al, I feel so much better now,&quot; Si&#39;ren muttered darkly before
she pressed down on the switch again.  &quot;Acknowledged, I&#39;m on my way,&quot; she said
before turning the comm-link off.
     &quot;If it&#39;s Air Traffic Control, they might have something for you about the
V&#39;ral,&quot; Al&#39;vexi suggested as Si&#39;ren stepped into a dry pair of boots.
     &quot;I know,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied.  &quot;And that&#39;s what worries me.  Thank you for the
dry underwear, Master Healer, it is appreciated.  Even if you had to go through
my laundry to find it,&quot; she added with a faint note of humor.
     &quot;You are, of course, welcome,&quot; Maq&#39;i replied with a bow of her head.
     &quot;Let&#39;s see what surprise is going to be dropped in our lap this time,&quot;
Si&#39;ren said to Al&#39;vexi with a heavy sigh as she headed for the door.
     Maq&#39;i remained where she was as she watched the pair of flag officers exit
the medical ward.  She knew that she really should have checked them both for
energy readings, but she was fairly sure that they weren&#39;t suffering from any
problems that a solid night&#39;s sleep wouldn&#39;t fix.  As for the rest of what was
on their minds....
     &quot;Master Healer?&quot; a voice said behind her, causing her to refocus her mind
and turn around.
     &quot;I trust you are well, Pa&#39;an?&quot; she asked once she saw who her visitor was.
     The monk made a gesture of indifference, seeming to wear the saw-toothed
robe with relative comfort.  He seemed to be oblivious to the fact that it was
one designed for a woman, and Maq&#39;i didn&#39;t see any reason to point that minor
detail out to him if she didn&#39;t have to.  &quot;I suppose I am in need of a nap,&quot; he
admitted with a faint smile, &quot;But I assure you I will not be passing out in the
immediate future.  Do you have a few minutes to spare for a discussion, by
chance?&quot; he added with an openly hopeful look.
     The faintest of smiles touched the corners of Maq&#39;i&#39;s lips as she could
see what he wanted.  &quot;To discuss the Moon Princess, I trust?&quot; she said lightly.
     &quot;If it would not be an imposition,&quot; Vol replied.  &quot;I know General Al&#39;vexi
didn&#39;t want a public discussion about the issue, but surely if a private and
very quiet conversation were to be held between you and I....&quot;
     Maq&#39;i simply made a gesture.  &quot;My office is this way,&quot; she said as she
started to move off.  &quot;And if you don&#39;t mind my saying so, Pa&#39;an, I do hope you
are feeling as well as you say, for you might find that things have gotten more
than a little interesting on Earth as of late....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     Sirene paused on the access ladder and peered into the open cockpit of her
Ghost-class aircraft.  &lt;Sir, are you alright?&gt; she asked carefully as the frame
of the aircraft continued to wobble back and forth.
     &quot;Forgive me, but I am merely trying to make sure I am both strapped in
securely and reasonably comfortable,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis apologized as he continued to
carefully shift his bulk back and forth.  The motion continued for another few
moments before he found an acceptable balance, keeping his wings neatly folded
around him while he gingerly tightened the straps that would keep them braced.
The fit was a dangerously tight one, having underestimated the actual space
available for a denizen of his size, but he was still determined on his course
of action.
     &lt;Just checking, sir,&gt; Sirene replied as she carefully climbed into the
pilot&#39;s seat, trying not to dwell too heavily on the surprisingly pleasing tone
of his unhelmeted voice.  His armor had been stored inside the Ghost&#39;s external
cargo hold with very little room to spare, and the general was now wearing only
an avian-design flight suit with gloves and a flight mask.  It was enough to
completely cover him from head to toe, save for his draconic wings, but it also
left his voice without the seemingly cold echo-effect of his armored helmet.
The timbre of his voice was such that, in another time and place, she might
have simply sat back to listen and enjoy the subtle, almost sexual thrill it
induced along her aural nerves where they meshed with her implant mask.
     She quickly strapped herself in and laid her head back against the padded
headrest before typing in a special command on her left-hand console.  A soft
whirring sound started up as a pair of probes were extruded from the seat that
immediately latched on to the sides of her implant mask.  Her senses began to
swim for a few moments as the monofiliments burrowed into the neural conduits
before making a connection to her nervous system.  The psionic component was
established a moment later and everything became crystal-clear once again, only
now with a vastly larger focus.
     &lt;Ghost-4 to flight bridge,&gt; she thought through the link as she used her
mind to instruct the aircraft to start the internal pre-flight checks.  There
were physical controls for the aircraft in easy reach of her hands, but those
would only be needed if there was a malfunction with the psionic link to the
aircraft.  For now, she *was* Ghost-4, able to feel and direct the aircraft
with her mind as easily as she could flex her hand or stretch her foot.
     &quot;Flight bridge, we read you loud and clear, Ghost-4,&quot; the voice on the
speaker said as the canopy started to come down.
     &lt;All internal checks are nominal,&gt; Sirene reported calmly as the engines
started to turn over.  She allowed them to operate for several seconds before
shutting them off, letting them remain in a preheated state for a quick restart
if necessary.  She didn&#39;t plan on having to use them until well after the drop
and had a chance to put some distance between her and the V&#39;ral, but she still
needed to make sure they would be available in an instant if something didn&#39;t
go according to plan.
     &quot;Copy, Ghost-4, prepare for drop-shot loading procedures,&quot; the voice said
from the flight bridge overlooking the entire hangar.
     &lt;You ready, sir?&gt; Sirene asked over the internal intercom that allowed a
pilot to converse with a passenger without having to yell or otherwise twist
around in the seats.
     There was a slight pause before the headset in Ar&#39;kanis&#39; flight mask was
turned on with a faint click.  &quot;I believe so, Major,&quot; he said calmly.  &quot;I trust
the drop procedures are similar to those of our tanks?&quot;
     &lt;Yes and no,&gt; Sirene replied as a dark shadow suddenly loomed over the
cockpit.  There was a heavy thumping noise and the entire aircraft was very
slowly hoisted into the air.  &lt;Yes in the sense that we will be loaded onto a
rail of sorts for a simple gravity-drop through an open hatch.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis grunted quietly.  &quot;So what&#39;s the difference?&quot; he asked wariliy.
     A faint smile crossed Sirene&#39;s face at the almost inaudible note of unease
in the general&#39;s normally stolid voice.  &lt;The trick, sir, is that the hatches
are the same size used by your tanks, so in order for this to work I have to
keep the wings folded against the hull as we get dropped nose-first.  We will
be tilting forward ninety degrees as soon as we&#39;re in position.&gt;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with obvious surprise.
     &lt;Look on the bright side,&gt; Sirene said with an audible smile.  &lt;You&#39;ll be
essentially on your back when we drop.  I&#39;m the one who&#39;ll be face-first as we
plummet into the open sky.  We should be ready now,&gt; she added as the aircraft
jerked to a halt and seemed to sway back and forth slightly for a few moments.
     &quot;Ghost-4, flight bridge,&quot; the speaker crackled.  &quot;Tilting now.&quot;
     Sirene simply clicked the channel twice to indicate her acknowledgment of
the warning.  The world began to lurch forward a few moments later as they were
essentially lifted tail-first up towards the ceiling, resulting in her weight
pressing down hard on the restraints and Ar&#39;kanis&#39;s wings being half-crushed
beneath his massive bulk.
     &quot;Brigadier Sor&#39;en to Ghost-4,&quot; a new voice said on the circuit as the
aircraft finally reached a nose-down position.
     &lt;Ghost-4 copies, Wing Commander,&gt; Sirene replied carefully, making sure to
patch the line into the internal channel so Ar&#39;kanis could hear as well.
     &quot;Major, are you sure you want to do this?&quot; Sor&#39;en said in a weary tone.
     &quot;I do, Brigadier,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis spoke up before Sirene could reply.  &quot;As we
discussed, you have full command of the V&#39;ral in my absence until my return or
until General Nop&#39;tera has fully recovered.  Now unless you have some new
information for us, I would ask that you not further distract my pilot.&quot;
     Sirene could clearly hear the sound of Sor&#39;en blinking up on the V&#39;ral&#39;s
main bridge at the rebuke, making the psionic Major wonder just what sort of
behind-the-scenes situation was going on this time.  She, like the rest of the
Red Wings, had been surprised to hear the announcement that Nop&#39;tera was ill
from an allergic reaction to something, and Ar&#39;kanis&#39; sudden request for a
stealthed visit to the Imperial Castle only deepened her sense of unease.
     &quot;No, sir, no new information,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied in a detached, almost
mechanical tone.  &quot;The V&#39;ral has come about to bearing two-two-seven and is at
thirty-four angels for your flight operations.  Your suggested course after
drop recovery is one-niner-seven.  Winds are bearing zero-four-seven at thirty-
four p&#39;kia with a shear change towards zero-niner-one at seventeen angels.
Safe flight, Ghost-4.  Main bridge out.&quot;
     She&#39;s pissed about something, Sirene thought with a very subtle shiver.
     &quot;Ghost-4, flight bridge,&quot; the speaker seemed to crackle in a subdued tone.
&quot;You are locked in position.  Drop controls are now yours.  Safe flight.&quot;
     &lt;Copy, flight bridge,&gt; Sirene replied as she sent a mental signal through
the monofiliment wire that was connected to the anchor points on her tail.  The
command caused the hatch directly beneath her to spiral open, exposing the pale
purple expanse of the lower atmosphere below her.  The view was a distinctly
hazy one, a side-effect of the light-bending cloaking field that surrounded the
airborne carrier and kept them hidden from everyone else.  Even from a height
and through the blurring effects of the screen, she could make out a few large
features of the ground directly below her that she would no doubt plow into at
terminal velocity if things didn&#39;t go according to plan.
     &lt;You ready, sir?&gt; she asked over the internal circuit.
     &quot;At your leisure, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis grunted in reply.
     &lt;Copy,&gt; Sirene said over both circuits.  &lt;Three... two... one... drop.&gt;
     The clamps on the tail section of the aircraft were released with a simple
mental command, allowing gravity to take over and send them plummeting into the
open sky.  The sensation was quite familiar to them both, she from countless
such drops before and he from the likewise countless experiences of having his
armored tank almost literally cannonballing from the bays on the underside of
the airborne carrier.  Best described as having your stomach attempting to leap
out through your throat, it was not a sensation for the weak of heart.
     There was the slightest of ripples in the air in front of them before the
view became perfectly clear as they passed beyond the limits of the cloaking
field.  The ground seemed to rush up towards them at an unnerving velocity
before Sirene both unfolded the normal wings and extended the underwings to
put them into a shallow glide.  The nose of the Ghost-class aircraft promptly
swung up to level with the horizon, producing a sensation that was not unlike
a rollercoaster encountering a very steep curve.
     &lt;You alright, sir?&gt; Sirene said carefully as she heard an odd noise coming
from the seat behind her.
     &quot;I&#39;m fine, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a noticeably strained voice.  &quot;Tanks
don&#39;t normally change orientation like that.  Or curve to the side like that
unless something is wrong,&quot; he quickly added as the horizon tilted at what had
to be a sixty-degree angle.
     &lt;Sorry, I&#39;m just changing course so we can&#39;t be traced back to the V&#39;ral,&gt;
she explained with a faint hint of apology.  The banking maneuver had been done
by simple pilot&#39;s instinct, and indeed could have been described as without
conscious thought if she wasn&#39;t literally flying by psionic command alone.
&lt;With all due respect, sir, you really should fly more often.&gt;
     &quot;I trust you will forgive me if I prefer driving my tank instead,&quot; he said
with a hint of dryness to his tone.  &quot;Granted we tend to be air-dropped with
regularity, but once we are on the ground we very rarely leave it again.&quot;
     &lt;Armored landworms,&gt; she teased as she adjusted their course with a far
more delicate touch this time.  The passive sensors in the nose of the Ghost
aircraft were showing a few large thermal blooms ahead of them, which meant she
stood a very good chance of being able to retain most of her altitude without
having to resort to the use of her thrusters.
     &quot;Mer&#39;catas may fly,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis countered with a chuckle, &quot;But landworms
very rarely wind up getting sucked into air-intakes.&quot;
     &lt;Point, sir,&gt; Sirene replied with a static-like chuckle of her own.  She
had long ago lost count of the number of times where she had been flying a jet-
powered aircraft at low altitudes and managed to pick up a flying creature in
her intakes.  The turbines usually managed to cope with the hapless life-form
without too much damage, or at least to the turbine, but there have been more
than one instance of a clogged intake requiring a controlled emergency landing.
     Ar&#39;kanis looked at the array of displays in front of him and sighed very
softly, knowing that he probably could find the information he wanted if he had
any idea how any of the panels worked.  &quot;How long until we reach the Imperial
Castle?&quot; he inquired as he absently tried to make sense of the readings.
     Sirene consulted her displays and made a few mental calculations.  &lt;If we
can stay in an unpowered glide like this, a little over an hour.  I can light
up the engines if you need a faster approach, but that will definitely increase
our energy signature.  I&#39;m starting to pick up some less-than-casual scatter
from a sensor array off to starboard, it&#39;s possible that they might have caught
a trace of something during the drop.&gt;
     A deep grunt rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; compressed chest.  &quot;How stealthed are
we?&quot; he inquired in a faintly cautious tone.
     &lt;We&#39;re not easy to see on radar, even at point-blank range,&gt; she informed
him.  &lt;The thing is, virtually all the stealthing is done passively.  Shielded
engine shrouds, radar-absorbing hull, very low slipstream signature, things of
that nature.  If someone paints us with a high-powered and very focused sensor
sweep, we&#39;ll probably show up.  Right now, our biggest weakness is the fact
that we&#39;re visible to the naked eye in the middle of the day.  I&#39;m trying to
find us a cloudbank to hide in, but the weather around here is extremely quiet
for some reason.  Probably a result of yesterday&#39;s blast,&gt; she suggested.
     &quot;Just do your best, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis instructed.  &quot;Our flight profile is
at your discretion, so long as we arrive at the Imperial Castle.  Preferably in
one piece,&quot; he added with a touch of dark humor.  &quot;If it becomes necessary to
talk to someone on the ground, I will handle that.&quot;
     &lt;Copy, sir,&gt; Sirene replied calmly.  She studied the thermal map of the
air in front of her and settled on a course, tilting them at a slight angle to
change their bearing to match.  A warning began to flash on her radar scanner
a few moments later, informing her that the intensity of the signal that had
been washing over them was starting to increase.
     &quot;Mmm?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis grunted to himself as he saw an identical message appear
on one of his displays.
     &lt;The scatter from the radar station is increasing, sir,&gt; Sirene spoke up
as she took a guess at what had garnered his attention.  &lt;We&#39;re not nearly at
detection values yet, but they&#39;re definitely sniffing for something.&gt;
     &quot;Let them sniff,&quot; the general rumbled quietly.  &quot;I took a shower before I
climbed into this flight suit, and I&#39;m fairly sure you did as well.&quot;
     Sirene would have arched her eyebrows up at the comment if she had any.
&lt;If you don&#39;t mind my saying so, sir, you seem to be in an unusual mood,&gt; she
ventured, wondering what sort of reaction she would get.
     A dry snort echoed in both her ears and along the psionic link that kept
her in touch with the internal systems.  &quot;I see you don&#39;t know me too well if
you don&#39;t think I have a sense of humor, Major,&quot; he pointed out as he continued
to study the radar signals the sensors were picking up.
     &lt;Due respect, sir, I never suggested you didn&#39;t,&gt; she replied.  &lt;And if I
may say this without sounding condescending, you never struck me as the kind of
person to open up to anyone outside of your tanker unit.  It is more than a
little difficult to get to know someone who is....&gt;
     &quot;Constantly entombed in armor?&quot; he spoke up as Sirene hesitated for a
moment to try to find the right words.
     Sirene twisted her head slightly to cast a sidelong glance out of the
corner of her eye.  &lt;That is not what I would have said or thought, sir, but I
will not argue the point if you won&#39;t,&gt; she said carefully.  The change in the
conversation had taken her by surprise, and she was more than a little uneasy
about how personal it seemed to have gotten in the span of a few breaths.
     &quot;I suppose you have a point, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis admitted quietly.  &quot;I will
confess to speaking far more freely to my tank crew when we are on a mission
than I do with the rest of the Red Wings.  It is.... difficult not to under
such circumstances, as everyone&#39;s lives are in the hands of everyone else.  I
lead and they follow, of course, as that is simply the nature of rank, but one
cannot help a sense of camaraderie on a more personal level in such conditions.
Such as now,&quot; he added absently.
     &lt;Something on your mind, sir?&gt; Sirene prodded carefully, knowing that she
was being offered a glimpse into a window that was rarely opened and had to be
very careful about peeking inside.
     &quot;Always, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled before falling silent.
     Sirene remained quiet as well, absently guiding the Ghost-class aircraft
through a series of gentle turns to keep themselves within the thermal blooms.
The radar scatter from the ground station was starting to fall off, suggesting
that either they weren&#39;t looking as hard as they were a few minutes ago, or
that their focus was well away from the swept-wing aircraft.  Either way, it
was definitely good news to hear.
     &quot;Whom do you confide in, Major?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis finally asked quietly.
     &lt;Sir?&gt; was the slightly puzzled response.
     A soft sigh rose up from the back seat.  &quot;Whom do you seek out when you
have questions that should not be asked, but still need to have answered?&quot;
     Sirene cast a sidelong glance out of the corner of her eye as she chewed
on the edge of her lip.  &lt;I guess that depends on the nature of the question,&gt;
she finally said.  &lt;I do tend to talk to Brigadier Sor&#39;en about most of my
concerns, as she is my wing commander.&gt;
     &quot;And when you can&#39;t ask the one who leads you?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis prodded gently.
     &lt;Usually someone I can trust not to talk about it,&gt; Sirene replied in a
guarded tone.  &lt;If I may, sir, I take it you have something on your mind that
you can&#39;t bring to General Nop&#39;tera&#39;s attention?&gt;
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera is all too aware of it,&quot; the tank general rumbled in reply.
&quot;That in itself is part of the problem.  The purpose of what I am doing is to
converse with Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren and seek a peaceful resolution of this....
animosity, if you will, between Nop&#39;tera and General Rune.  We will soon be
facing a crisis of epic proportions, if we aren&#39;t doing so already, and we will
need a unified military if we are to respond to events with any success.&quot;
     &lt;What sort of crisis?&gt; Sirene asked, her digital voice clearly filled with
wariness and unease.
     Another quiet rumble rose up from his massive chest.  &quot;Are you aware of
the message drone that emerged from the Hinterland Rift this morning?&quot;
     The aircraft started to tilt to one side as she carefully steered towards
another thermal bloom in the distance, keeping a virtual eye on the slowly
decreasing altitude reading as they glided along in near-silence.  &lt;That a
drone came through, yes,&gt; she said carefully.  &lt;I haven&#39;t heard anyone say for
certain what it had to say, however.  Most seem to think it was just a routine
message or something from General Pra&#39;dek.&gt;
     &quot;Put the controls on autopilot for a moment,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis suggested.  &quot;And I
don&#39;t mean mental guidance, either.&quot;
     Sirene would have physically twisted around in the cockpit to look at him
if she could have done so without breaking the monofiliment connections to her
implants.  She remained silent for a number of moments before reaching up to
key in a series of commands on her side console, returning the Ghost to a level
flight profile and locking it on a straight course.  She could still issue an
override if she needed to, but it would be a two-step process instead of a very
simple mental thought.
     &lt;Very well, sir,&gt; she said in a neutral tone as she sat back and closed
her eyes, neatly folding her hands in her lap.  She didn&#39;t need to use her
optic implants to fly the aircraft, being able to &#39;see&#39; with the sensors just
as well, but the visual darkness helped to allow her to focus on the sound of
his voice and his words.  &lt;Guidance is automatic.&gt;
     &quot;Pra&#39;dek indeed sent the drone,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis explained in a muted tone as he
stared at the various displays in front of him.  &quot;The message it contained was
not with his voice, however, but rather that of a Renn collaborator.  Why or
how is unknown, but the moon of Nathanya has exploded.&quot;
     &lt;What?&gt; Sirene blurted out as her eyes snapped open.  A distant part of
her was extremely grateful for the fact that she had taken a mental step back
from the controls, as the shock would likely have sent the stealthed aircraft
into a steep dive she might not have been able to recover from in time.
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera and I expect further information soon, of course, along with as
detailed an explanation as possible,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis continued.  &quot;Regardless of the
cause, it is anticipated that Paleste&#39;s passage through Nathanya&#39;s remains will
ultimately send debris towards the main planet.  Again, we simply do not have
enough information to speculate the scale of this, but it is not unreasonable
to presume that there could be a global catastrophe.  If a planetary evacuation
is warranted, the Negaverse military will be able to assist with the logistics,
but only if we are unified as one instead of bickering amongst ourselves like
young siblings.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis paused and raised an eyebrows as he heard a soft hiss of static
in his helmet, wondering if the connection had gone bad or if Sirene&#39;s vocoder
was malfunctioning again.  It became obvious a moment later that that static
was merely the telepath exhaling very slowly as she tried to remain calm, able
to hear the rush of air coming from over his shoulder.  &quot;Are you alright,
Major?&quot; he inquired once the hissing noise tapered off.
     &lt;The entire moon?&gt; she said in a subdued tone.  &lt;Like Jalandor?&gt;
     &quot;The cause is unknown, but the effect is the same,&quot; he replied quietly.
&quot;Unlike Nathanya, however, the remains of Jalandor won&#39;t be heavily disturbed too much
by Paleste&#39;s gravity well anytime soon.&quot;
     &lt;Understood, sir,&gt; Sirene said, more out of simple military reflex than
anything else.  Her blood was still ice-cold with shock, and it took her a few
seconds before she felt she could safely resume psionic control of the Ghost.
&lt;Flight control is back on manual, sir, and I may have to fire up the engines
if we want to remain aloft.  We&#39;re about a quarter of the way to the Imperial
Castle and I&#39;m not seeing many thermals ahead that I can glide on.&gt;
     &quot;You&#39;re the pilot, Major, it is at your discretion,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with an
absent gesture of his hand.
     &lt;Just wanted to warn you, sir,&gt; Sirene replied as she flexed her hands to
try to return some circulation to them.  Her skin felt dangerously cold, even
inside the flight suit, and right now she would have given an awful lot to be
curled up in a ball beneath the blankets in her quarters.  The entire moon....
     &quot;If I may, Major,&quot; the general rumbled quietly, &quot;I would appreciate your
silence on the matter upon our return to the V&#39;ral.  Nop&#39;tera will make an
announcement on the Hinterland situation when she is ready to, but she and I
agree that it is best to wait until we get as much information as possible and
can verify its accuracy.  Many of us have strong ties to the Renn&#39;s homeworld
for various reasons, and we should not like to cause unease with unfounded
rumors or baseless speculations.  Brigadier Sor&#39;en is aware of the situation,
but she too has been asked for her silence for the moment.&quot;
     &lt;Understood, sir,&gt; Sirene replied, having the feeling that Sor&#39;en hadn&#39;t
been &#39;asked&#39; to remain silent but rather ordered to be.  Neither Jalandor nor
Nathanya were populated moons, but there were a few Red Wings who were born in
the colony on the moon of Havar, which was located in a shallow orbit between
the planet and Nathanya&#39;s broader orbit.  If any of the newly-formed asteroids
were nudged towards the homeworld by Paleste&#39;s gravity, they would first have
to cross Havar&#39;s orbit with most likely devastating results....
     &quot;I understand your concerns, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly, catching
Sirene off-guard.  &quot;Silence can be a heavy burden at times, but other times it
is far easier to bear than the cost of speaking out and risking change.&quot;
     Sirene paused as his words seemed to be just a little too introspective.
&lt;With due respect, sir,&gt; she said carefully as she made sure the engines were
still in a pre-started state, &lt;Was that directed at me, or was that directed at
yourself?  Starting engines,&gt; she added in a muted tone as she ignited them.
     Ar&#39;kanis remained quiet as the noise of the engines started to roar around
him, quickly ramping up from a dull thrum to a steady rumble that he could feel
in his bones.  The sound wasn&#39;t overly loud, at least not compared to some of
the engine noises that could be heard inside the confines of his tank, but it
was still something to be consciously noticed.
     &quot;It is.... not easy to admit a fear to anyone, let alone to someone who
means something to you,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a soft murmur.  &quot;In such cases, one
tends to remain silent as much as possible, seeking instead to deal with the
fear through other means.&quot;
     Sirene remained silent as she listened to his muted words, focusing on the
quiet emotion behind them as she gently nudged the Ghost into a higher flight
path.  The radar scatter began to return a moment later, again from the small
station off to the north, but she thought it unwise to mention it to him just
yet or otherwise disrupt his introspective mood.
     &quot;When this is over,&quot; the winged general continued quietly, &quot;And by this I
mean the internal strife among senior military staff, it is likely that General
Nop&#39;tera will assume the role of Commander-General of the entire military and
that I will be given permanent command of the Red Wings.  Should this come to
pass, I doubt I will be able to lead my tank divisions from the forefront as a
proper general should, but rather remain on the V&#39;ral&#39;s main bridge.  I shall,
of course, miss the luxury of front-line combat operations, but it will be a
price I would willingly pay for the benefit and sake of the Red Wings.  Such is
one of the many burdens of command,&quot; he added with the hollowest of chuckles.
     &lt;But that&#39;s not what bothers you, is it?&gt; Sirene spoke up quietly.
     A very soft and deep sigh rose up from his chest, seeming to rumble like
a plume of gas from a less-than-quiescent volcano.  &quot;No, Major, it is not,&quot; he
admitted.  &quot;Like you, I was born to military parents on the very slow march to
war and victory, and like so many others, have chosen to walk that path myself
since I was of age.  I have no regrets of where that path has taken me, nor do
I regret my lifetime of service to Nop&#39;tera in the slightest.  Indeed, I fear
I have come to savor it more than I should, for what disturbs me the most is
not the notion of being the one whom others would choose to follow in life, but
rather that I will no longer be able follow her path as well.&quot;
     Sirene remained silent for a moment as a faint chill ran through her at
the depth of emotion in his soft words.  &lt;But if she becomes the Commander-
General, doesn&#39;t that mean everyone in the military will follow her?&gt; she said
carefully as she eyed the radar display.  The scatter from the station was
still slowing increasing, making her warily wonder if they had indeed somehow
picked up on the fact that her stealthed aircraft was in the area.
     &quot;Indeed we would, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied quietly.  &quot;But then it would be
from a distance instead of at her side.  No doubt that she views naming me as
her successor for the Red Wings as a just reward for my life of leadership and
service in her name, but I must confess that it is not the reward I seek.  All
that I have asked of her and will ever ask is acknowledgement of my services
and the chance to continue serving at her side.  Major, am I to presume that
there is some significance to this flashing icon on the upper-right display?&quot;
he added in a guarded tone as the amber light caught his attention.
     &lt;Yes, it means someone is getting awfully curious with the radar scans,&gt;
she replied in a slightly flat tone.  &lt;I&#39;m starting to think somebody got an
echo of something, either when we dropped or when I fired up the engines, and
now they&#39;re trying to pin something down.  I&#39;m still not detecting any narrow-
beam sweeps, which suggests they don&#39;t have anything solid yet, but that one
station is still sniffing carefully.&gt;
     A quiet grunt rose up from the back half of the cockpit.  &quot;As I said, let
them sniff,&quot; the general rumbled.  &quot;If we are actually detected, let me handle
communicating with whomever is interested.  Mmm?&quot; he added as fully half of his
displays suddenly lit up without warning, accompanied by a series of soft but
rapid beeps.  &quot;Major?&quot; he prompted.
     &lt;Someone just got serious,&gt; Sirene reported in a faintly edged tone.  &lt;An
anti-aircraft radar just lit up a few miles ahead of us, and another pair of
radar stations just ramped up activity to the south.  We&#39;re still nowhere near
detection values yet, but that signal ahead of us is rotating between search
and seek modes.  That&#39;s what&#39;s setting off the warning alarm,&gt; she added.
     &quot;Any indication that they are searching for the V&#39;ral?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired
calmly as he tried making sense of the radar readings.
     &lt;It&#39;s possible,&gt; Sirene admitted as she nudged the Ghost a few degrees to
the south to avoid flying directly over the anti-aircraft radar.  &lt;I doubt they
will find anything, given the evasion screens, but.... k&#39;ves,&gt; she spat as a
hard beeping started up inside the cockpit.  &lt;Someone just switched on a laser
relay for a satellite uplink just as we passed over the dish.  If they weren&#39;t
sure we were in the area before, they&#39;re pretty certain about it now.  Not that
they couldn&#39;t tell by simply looking up at the sky, but still....&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis simply grunted quietly to himself.  &quot;Any message traffic?&quot;
     &lt;Nothing I can detect, which doesn&#39;t mean much,&gt; Sirene replied.  &lt;They
could be using landlines to communicate, infrared lasers.... k&#39;ves, they could
be using smoke signals at this point and I wouldn&#39;t be able to tap into it,&gt;
she growled quietly.  &lt;So much for your stealthed approach, sir.  Sorry.&gt;
     &quot;At ease, Major,&quot; the general said gently.  &quot;I did not expect to arrive at
the Imperial Castle without detection at some point, I merely wished to avoid
exposing the position of the V&#39;ral during launch.&quot;
     &lt;Fair enough, sir,&gt; Sirene said absently as she focused on what her Ghost
aircraft&#39;s sensors were telling her.  A small burst of radio energy flashed
past them in a blink of an eye, a &quot;packet&quot; of data being &quot;squirted&quot; out into
the open that took a few moments for her to properly decipher.  &lt;Well, you just
got your wish, sir,&gt; she reported.  &lt;I just picked up a Raid Watch issued to
the entire Central Plains division.  No details given, just a general stand-to
order to all military units in the region.&gt;
     &quot;Expected,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis murmured as he closed his eyes with a soft sigh.
     Sirene paused for a moment before she closed her eyes as well, focusing on
the sudden bursts of energy her Ghost&#39;s sensors were starting to pick up in
abundance.  &lt;Starting to get chatter on the radio frequencies,&gt; she reported as
she tried listening to six conversations at once.  &lt;One unit is reporting a
visual on an unknown aircraft but no radar contact.... another is reporting a
transient blip from a few minutes ago.... I think they got a lucky bounce-back
pulse on the wings as I unfolded them after the drop,&gt; she added.
     &quot;Can you transfer the feeds back here?&quot; he inquired.
     Sirene absently shook her head gently.  &lt;Sorry, sir, I&#39;ve got an implant
chip decrypting them as they come across the sensors, there&#39;s nothing audible
being said out in the open just yet, just data squirts.  It&#39;s an experimental
psionic processor, so I can&#39;t just plug you into it as well.  Not yet, at any
rate,&gt; she added.
     &quot;Distance to the Imperial Castle?&quot; he prodded.
     &lt;We passed the halfway point right around the time they got a clue,&gt; was
the slightly distracted reply.  &lt;Sir, a bunch of radar stations are starting
to come online and the scatter is getting thicker.  We&#39;ll be at the low-end of
the detection threshold in another minute or two if they keep this up, and I&#39;m
seeing a pair of tight-beam sweeps up ahead.  I can slip between them without
anyone noticing at the radar consoles, but as I said earlier, we&#39;re pretty easy
to spot in the open sky in the middle of the day like this.&gt;
     A quiet grunt rose up from his chest.  &quot;Understood,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said simply.
&quot;You are, I trust, prepared to eject if things become actively hostile?&quot;
     It took Sirene a moment to figure out how best to respond to his words.
&lt;That depends on the situation, sir,&gt; she said in a wary voice.  &lt;But yes, I am
properly strapped in and all.  With all due respect, General Ar&#39;kanis, you&#39;re
not exactly inspiring confidence at the moment.&gt;
     &quot;It is simple, Major,&quot; he said as he leaned over to the communications
panel and began to manipulate the settings.  &quot;I am about to inform our military
brethren of my presence and thus provide them with a very high-profile target.
I have no hesitations facing death should it ultimately be of some use or value
to Nop&#39;tera, but I would rather not take anyone else with me if it can somehow
be avoided.&quot;  He paused with his hand on the controls as he heard a very quiet
noise over his shoulder, one eyebrow arching up.  &quot;Not that I intend to be made
a sacrifice, mind you,&quot; he added lightly.
     Sirene just reached up to rub the lower ridge of her nose where her flesh
met the metal alloy of her implant mask.  &lt;It wouldn&#39;t be the first time I was
shot down in the line of duty, sir,&gt; she replied with a weary sigh.
     &quot;I don&#39;t think they will shoot at us, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied calmly as
he finished setting the frequency.  &quot;I am sure they can imagine what Nop&#39;tera
will do if she learns that her executive officer was assassinated.  Hopefully
we can avoid this situation altogether.&quot;
     &lt;Right, sir,&gt; Sirene replied, clearly not convinced.
     &quot;Ghost-4 to the Imperial Castle,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said as he pressed the transmit
switch, opening the broadcast frequency he had specified.  He waited in silence
for a reply, a faint frown crossing his face as he heard only empty static.
&quot;Ghost-4 hailing the Imperial Castle,&quot; he repeated in a measured tone.
     &lt;P&#39;tais,&gt; Sirene growled as a low-pitched monotone alarm went off in the
cockpit.  &lt;We just got solidly bracketed by three narrow-beam radars that went
active a moment ago, and now we&#39;re being tracked by a fire-control radar in
seek mode.  Hope you&#39;re firmly strapped in, sir, because I&#39;m not about to hold
still if they&#39;re getting ready to launch a missile at us.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis sighed and dialed open the public frequencies.  &quot;This is General
Ar&#39;kanis of the Imperial Red Wings,&quot; he said in a level tone.  &quot;I am inbound on
an approach vector to the Imperial Castle to meet with Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren.
Any hostile action taken against my aircraft will be viewed as an act of both
treason and rebellion by a rogue military unit and will subsequently be dealt
with accordingly.&quot;
     Sirene just closed her eyes at his words, minorly grateful for the fact
that the tank general couldn&#39;t see the expression on her face.  &lt;Sir?&gt; she said
in a very careful tone.  &lt;You do realize that I&#39;m only armed with conventional
anti-missile weaponry, right?&gt;
     &quot;You know that and I know that, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said calmly.  &quot;Or at
least I know that now,&quot; he amended, causing Sirene to reach down and grasp the
crotch of her flight suit to keep her bladder from reacting.  &quot;However, having
independently developed this particular model of aircraft ourselves during the
course of our campaign against the Renn, I doubt the rest of the Negaverse
military is aware of its capabilities.  Or lack thereof,&quot; he added with a very
faint note of humor.
     &lt;Yes, sir,&gt; she replied, not knowing what else to say.
     &quot;Hail, Ghost-4,&quot; the speaker crackled without warning.  &quot;This is Commander
May&#39;el of the First Plains Shock Front.  You have entered restricted airspace
and have done so using a hostile flight profile.  You are ordered to come about
to bearing zero-nine-one and increase altitude to fifteen angels.  Failure to
comply will result in the immediate grounding of your aircraft.&quot;
     A soft laugh rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; chest.  &quot;I will admit that being a
tank commander means I am not as well-versed as others might be on the normal
protocols for flight operations.  Having said that, I would be of the mind that
he just threatened to shoot us down, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot; he said lightly.
     &lt;Two missile battery radars just came online,&gt; Sirene warned.  &lt;I&#39;m glad
to see that our flag officers don&#39;t lose their senses of humor just because we
are in a tense situation, but with all due respect, sir, now is not the time to
be playing with your k&#39;vesan.&gt;
     &quot;Let me reiterate,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said as he thumbed the switch open.  &quot;This is
General Ar&#39;kanis of the Imperial Red Wings, and I am on my way to the Imperial
Castle for a meeting with Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren.  I am sure that both she and
General Nop&#39;tera would be most displeased if I were to be late for our meeting
because my pilot had to stop and pick the missile shrapnel out of her engine
shrouds.  Feel free to send up an escort if it will make you feel better, but
we will be continuing on our original flight path.  Please advise if you can
offer a clearer approach vector to the Castle,&quot; he added calmly.  &quot;Are you
alright, Major?&quot; he added over the internal circuit as he heard an exasperated
sigh behind him.
     &lt;Ask me once we&#39;re on the ground, sir,&gt; she muttered.  &lt;Assuming we&#39;re
offered the option of landing on our own.  May I dispense with the stiffness
of rank for a moment, sir?&gt;
     &quot;By all means,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied, seeming to be amused at her words.
     &lt;Perhaps you&#39;re not aware of our current situation too well, so permit me
the honor of spelling it out for you,&gt; she said flatly.  &lt;This is not a combat
aircraft in any sense of the word.  The defenses are mostly passive and the
skin of my hull is probably about as thick as your toenail.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;re
used to having tank armor to backstop you if your usual brand of diplomacy
fails, but right now we have no such luxury.  Would you mind stopping for a few
brief moments to think before saying things that might piss off a field officer
who likely has the launch button of a missile battery beneath his fingers?&gt;
     &quot;I am aware of the risks, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said gently.  &quot;In fact, I am
far more aware of the risks that you would think, though they might not be
readily apparent to you even with your enhanced vision.  What I am seeking to
do is save our world from a conflict, and in order to do so I have to be able
to talk to Admiral Si&#39;ren in person.  If I fail, I strongly suspect that we are
all as good as dead anyway, so there is little need for me to hold back if it
will get me what I need.  And at this moment, I need to get on over to the
Imperial Castle, and missile-toting field commanders from the Central Plains
Division be damned.&quot;
     &lt;Understood, sir,&gt; Sirene replied in a neutral tone.  &lt;But with all due
respect, your odds of success might be improved if the other side doesn&#39;t feel
like they&#39;re being told to sit and rotate.&gt;  She paused for a brief moment as
her sensors began to detect radio bursts that were encrypted and seemed to be
originating from the same antenna that had challenged them earlier.  &lt;Sir, I&#39;m
starting to pick up more message traffic, and this one seems to be directed to
a higher military authority.  They might be conversing with either the division
commander or the Imperial Castle.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis nodded to himself, the faint smile on his lips thoroughly hidden
by his flight mask.  &quot;Put yourself in his position, Major,&quot; he said calmly.
&quot;The first senior-grade officer to arrive in the radar room after an alert,
most likely only the battalion&#39;s executive officer, and he is confronted with
a full general who claims to be going to a high-level meeting with the head of
the entire Navy.  If I were him, I would be asking for guidance as well,&quot; he
added lightly as he folded his hands over his abdomen to wait.  &quot;What is the
radar situation?&quot;
     &lt;We&#39;re bracketed by four tight-beam arrays, plus a pair of missile battery
arrays in seek mode,&gt; Sirene reported with a faint edge to her metallic tone.
&lt;They all look like they&#39;re wavering slightly between sweeps, which suggests
that they don&#39;t all have solid locks on us but instead are reacquiring us by
triangulation after each sweep.  That probably has them very edgy right now,&gt;
she pointed out in a measured tone.  &lt;If I may point out, sir, there are many
kinds of aerial profiles to be used depending on the mission at hand.  Right
now, we probably look like a stealthed bomber to them.&gt;
     That caused the unarmored general to sit up slightly.  &quot;Oh?  How so?&quot; he
rumbled as he cast a wary eye at the display consoles.
     &lt;Low altitude, fairly slow cruising speed which suggests a heavy load, I&#39;m
sure the stealth aspects are driving them nuts,&gt; Sirene immediately rattled off
as she ticked her fingers for each point.  &lt;You just told them we&#39;re Red Wings,
which they have no immediate love for, not that I can&#39;t imagine why....&gt;
     &quot;Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a tone of gentle rebuke.
     &lt;Odds are they can&#39;t even scan us for armaments because of the stealth,&gt;
Sirene continued, ignoring the interruption.  &lt;And your suggestion that we
would &#39;deal&#39; with any unit attacking us probably only made the whole situation
even more threatening than it should be.  Sir, please tell me you thought of
this earlier,&gt; she added as she heard a disgruntled sigh behind her.
     &quot;I had not,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis admitted in what for him was a fairly sheepish tone.
&quot;As you correctly pointed out earlier, Major, I am not used to negotiating with
an opposing force from a less-than-sturdy combat platform.  When we return to
the V&#39;ral, you will be given the opportunity to freely express yourself to
General Nop&#39;tera and take me to task for my oversight.  However, we have to
concern ourselves with the present situation.  If we may appear to be a bomber
to them, we must alter their perceptions to show that we are not.&quot;
     &lt;You know that and I know that, sir,&gt; Sirene replied in a perfectly even
voice.  &lt;However, having independently developed this particular model of
aircraft ourselves during the course of our campaign against the Renn, I doubt
the rest of the Negaverse military is aware of our capabilities, or the lack
thereof.&gt;
     &quot;Major Sirene, as deserving as I am of such a rebuke, I distinctly said
that you will be offered that opportunity upon our return to the V&#39;ral and not
before,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis pointed out dryly.
     &lt;Copy, sir.&gt;
     &quot;Excellent.  Now then, would I be amiss in thinking that because we are
flying in a stealthed profile, we are not broadcasting a transponder signal of
any sort?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis mused aloud.
     Sirene blinked in surprise and cast a quick glance down at her consoles.
&lt;No, sir, the transponder is off,&gt; she said warily.  &lt;If I may point out, sir,
that we will be providing a homing beacon for any missiles launched at us if
you have me turn it back on.&gt;
     &quot;I am aware of that, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied gently.  &quot;However, it will
also raise our visibility profile, which is not something any attack aircraft
would wish to do.  Now that they know we are here and why, I see no further
need to mask our presence.&quot;
     &lt;To avoid getting shot down by some trigger-happy missile battery?&gt; she
suggested archly as she cast a sidelong glance over her shoulder.
     &quot;Thank you, Major.  Activate the transponder, please,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis ordered.
     Sirene suppressed the urge to sigh heavily and directed a mental command
through the monofiliment links.  The tiny transmitter in the tail section began
to give off a steady stream of energy pulses, causing her aircraft to abruptly
appear on every single radar screen trying to locate her.  There was a delay
of precisely three-tenths of a second before no less than four missile fire-
control radars promptly locked onto her transponder signal, resulting in a very
rapid beeping sound in the cockpit.
     &lt;Transponder activated, sir,&gt; Sirene said in a tone devoid of emotion.
     &quot;Thank you, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said after a slight hesitation.  &quot;Tell me,
that beeping sound we hear isn&#39;t the transponder itself, is it?&quot;
     &lt;No, sir,&gt; Sirene replied.  &lt;That&#39;s the onboard computer warning me that
we&#39;re bracketed by the seeker units in the missile warheads.  Our lifespan is
now limited to six seconds once the first missile is launched.  That will be a
solid tone, sir,&gt; she added absently as she turned her focus inward, trying to
get a feel for the positioning of the missiles around her and the best way to
attempt an escape if they light up.  &lt;And with all due respect, sir, flag rank
or not, if I get that tone we&#39;re out of here.&gt;
     &quot;Understood, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said simply.  &quot;Distance to the castle?&quot;
     &lt;Almost there, sir,&gt; the cybernetic woman replied.  &lt;Assuming I haven&#39;t
crossed the line into insubordination yet, sir, do you annoy your tank drivers
like this?  You&#39;re like a little kid in the backseat of a transport wondering
if we&#39;re there yet.&gt;
     A quiet chuckle rose up from the back of the cockpit.  &quot;I assure you that
what is said between us will remain so,&quot; he said with open amusement.  &quot;As I
mentioned earlier, it is difficult not to develop a sense of camaraderie when
in such a situation.  To answer your charge, Major, I would admit that in the
none-too-distant past I have been rather bluntly told, if respectfully, to sit
back down and hold my tongue so as not to distract the others.&quot;
     &lt;I believe it,&gt; Sirene commented absently.  She paused for a moment as her
sensors picked up two new radar sources approaching from the south, as well as
a flurry of encrypted messages squirted from a relay station that appeared to
originate from the Imperial Castle.  &lt;Sir, I&#39;m picking up a pair of inbounds
from the south, possibly Guardian-class interceptors, as well as some heavy
division-wide message traffic.  Nothing I can translate for you yet.&gt;
     &quot;Escorts, I presume?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled.
     &lt;Let&#39;s hope,&gt; Sirene replied.
     &quot;Attention, Ghost-4,&quot; the radio speaker suddenly crackled.  &quot;You are
ordered to track right to a bearing to two-eight-zero and maintain altitude.
A pair of Guardians will be forming up off your wings and have instructions to
ground you if you do anything remotely suspicious.  Admiral Si&#39;ren sends her
regards and will have an escort waiting for you on your arrival at the western
landing field.&quot;
     &lt;Ghost-4 copies,&gt; Sirene said over the circuit before Ar&#39;kanis could reach
for the microphone.  &lt;Tracking right to bearing two-eight-zero.  Ghost-4 to
Guardian flight,&gt; she said as she switched frequencies, making sure to keep
Ar&#39;kanis&#39; headset patched in.
     &quot;Hail, Ghost-4, this is Guardian-8,&quot; the circuit said in a female voice.
&quot;Maintain flight speed and bearing until instructed otherwise, Guardian-11 will
be doing a close fly-by for a visual inspection.  Don&#39;t do anything unexpected,
as it will likely ruin both our days, over.&quot;
     &lt;Ghost-4 copies,&gt; Sirene said before muting the external circuits.  &lt;Sir,
they appear to be your standard pair of Guardian-class aircraft, no heavy
external weapons detected.  They have their fire-control radars active but set
into search mode instead of seek, which means we&#39;re not about to eat a missile
without plenty of advanced warning.  At least from the interceptors,&gt; she added
as an afterthought.  &lt;They&#39;re forming up off our wings now, sir.&gt;
     &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about your airborne brethren, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with
an audible note of satisfaction.  &quot;It seems that we are not going to be made
late for our meeting after all.  Rest assured that Brigadier Sor&#39;en will hear
of your service and piloting skill once our mission is complete.  Interesting,&quot;
he added as he glanced off to his side, able to see another aircraft in rather
close proximity to the end of their wings.  &quot;Do they normally fly that close?&quot;
     &lt;For a visual inspection, yes,&gt; was the reply.  &lt;I&#39;m sure they&#39;re making
quite certain we don&#39;t have any bombs or the like mounted on the rails.&quot;
     &quot;She looks clean to me, ma&#39;am,&quot; the speaker crackled quietly.  &quot;Hell, I&#39;m
not sure those pylons could support weapons anyway.  Seems to be all wing.
Well, except for those flare pods on the shroud, but who doesn&#39;t have them?&quot;
     &quot;Copy, Lieutenant, I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d be packing anyway,&quot; the other
pilot replied, not realizing that they were both on a frequency that could be
heard by the the Ghost.
     &quot;Major?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis asked in a puzzled tone over the internal circuit.
     &lt;Hush,&gt; Sirene replied quietly.  &lt;I want to hear what they&#39;re saying.&gt;
     &quot;What kind of bird is that, anyway?&quot; the first pilot said as he edged his
interceptor a few ke&#39;shels away for more maneuvering room.
     &quot;A quiet one,&quot; Guardian-8 said calmly.  &quot;Just keep an eye on her anyway.
If she is toting some flag in the backseat, I doubt she&#39;ll do anything stupid,
but who knows what kind of training these Red Wings have.&quot;
     &lt;At least we know which circuit is the internal one and which one is the
open channel,&gt; Sirene spoke up in a faintly edged tone.  A small smile brushed
the edges of her lips as she heard a muted curse on the circuit, followed by a
click as one of the Guardians closed their line.
     &quot;Mistakes happen, Ghost-4,&quot; the pilot of Guardian-8 replied calmly.  &quot;So
while I have you up here, you mind explaining just what the t&#39;zarn you&#39;re doing
with all this stealth business?&quot;
     &quot;Deploying on a mission without compromising the steath of my carrier,&quot;
Ar&#39;kanis spoke up calmly.  &quot;Surely you can understand that one, miss...?&quot;
     &quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Ceran of the Central Division Air Command,&quot; the voice
replied crisply.
     &lt;Sir?&gt; Sirene said wearily.  &lt;Try not to irritate her, please?  She is
flying a fully-armed and considerably more combat-capable aircraft model than
what you&#39;re riding in.&gt;
     &quot;Duly noted, Major.  To answer your question, Colonel Ceran,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
said as he smoothly switched channels, &quot;The objective was to make a very quiet
visit to the Imperial Castle to meet with Admiral Si&#39;ren, and I didn&#39;t want the
V&#39;ral to become exposed to any more ballistic missile fire in the process.&quot;
     &lt;K&#39;vesi t&#39;zarn, sir,&gt; Sirene moaned in resignation.
     A dry snort came across the circuit in response.  &quot;I&#39;m just a pilot, sir,
you&#39;ll have to talk to someone else about the political navidshi,&quot; Ceran said
in a distinctly unhappy tone.  &quot;All I give a rakketh&#39;s ptanka right now is
making sure you behave and getting you on the ground without incident.  You
should be within range of Air Traffic Control in a moment, they&#39;ll give you a
proper approach vector.  Good luck with your meeting, sir, and with all due
respect, try not to start another war this time.  Life was interesting enough
with two nuclear warheads going off within the span of a week, we really don&#39;t
need a third one going up.  Steady flight, Ghost-4.  Guardian-8 out.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose she has a point,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis allowed as he set the microphone
back in the cradle and leaned back against the seat as well as his wings would
allow.  He paused to listen as he heard a very indistinct grumbling sound from
over his shoulder.  &quot;Did you say something, Major?&quot; he prodded carefully.
     &lt;I said you&#39;re walking home, sir,&gt; Sirene grumbled.  She paused as a new
frequency came across her sensors, opting this time to respond to it with a
purely mental command.  &lt;We&#39;re being hailed by Air Traffic Control for final
landing procedures,&gt; she reported.
     &quot;At your leisure, Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied.  &quot;Hopefully Admiral Si&#39;ren
will be just as easy to deal with as the rest of the Central Division has been
so far.&quot;
     &lt;Let&#39;s hope so, sir,&gt; Sirene replied as she settled into a shallow glide.
&lt;I would hate to see how it could possibly get any worse at this point....&gt;

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;It took you long enough,&quot; Leda grumbled as she glanced up from her math
homework to give the blonde a disgruntled look.
     Mina shrugged in dismissal as she set Artemis down on the table.  &quot;I told
you I had a few things to do first,&quot; she replied.  She paused as she glanced
over at Serena, her eyebrows arching up a few inches in surprise.  &quot;Serena,
please tell me you got that from Susan&#39;s closet and not your own,&quot; she hedged.
     A dark blush swept across Serena&#39;s face as she flicked her glowing wings
behind her.  &quot;I did,&quot; she murmured, her triple-tone voice seeming to resonate
with embarrassment.  She had changed out of her school uniform into a pair of
comfortable blue jeans and very little else, her modesty barely preserved by a
wide but distinctly thin ribbon of dark green fabric that had been wrapped
around her waist to rise up and criss-cross over her breasts.  While the attire
left her back completely exposed and thus provided a free-range of motion for
her wings, it also left a great deal of her feminine curves exposed as well as
highlighting both the location and size of her nipples.
     &quot;Actually, I did,&quot; Alex spoke up as she hovered over Ami&#39;s shoulder with
a faintly puzzled look.  &quot;But I figured that Sue wouldn&#39;t mind in the least as
it&#39;s for the Princess.  One more time, babe,&quot; she sighed quietly.  &quot;You add a
single drop of this,&quot; she said, tapping part of the rather lengthy chemistry
equation Ami was mapping out, &quot;And you wind up with all of that?&quot;
     &quot;Not all at once,&quot; Ami said patiently.  &quot;Adding the sodium bicarbonate to
the solution will start a precipitation reaction, this part.  Then when you
filter out the solute and heat it, then you wind up with this next reaction.&quot;
     &quot;What frightens me is I think I can follow that,&quot; Mina said casually as
she slipped her backpack off her shoulders and started to dig inside.
     &quot;Heaven forbid the chemistry lessons should be sinking in,&quot; Ami said dryly
as she continued to sketch out the reactions without missing a beat.
     &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; Mina said absently as she finally extracted her history book and
plopped it on the table.  &quot;So who&#39;s working on what, or should I ask?  Artemis,
what are you doing?&quot; she sighed as she noticed the white cat poking his head
into the open backpack.
     &quot;Please tell me that&#39;s not pineapple I smell,&quot; he sighed, still nose-first
inside the backpack and sniffing intently.
     Both Mina and Leda paused before glancing at one another.  &quot;I had a few
rings with lunch,&quot; Mina said slowly, her tone causing the rest of the group to
look up at her.  &quot;Why?&quot;
     &quot;Great,&quot; Artemis sighed as he backed up and sat down, giving her a weary
expression.  &quot;You know pineapple gives you gas, right?&quot;
     &quot;It does not!&quot; Mina said indignantly, giving him an upset look.
     &quot;Maybe not when you&#39;re awake,&quot; Artemis muttered darkly.  He yelped sharply
in surprise as he was grabbed by a pair of wings and yanked back just moments
before Mina could swat him with her textbook.
     &quot;Hey, hey, hey, easy on the cat, eh?&quot; Alex said as she moved over to very
gently pluck Artemis out of Serena&#39;s winged embrace.  &quot;No need to shoot the
messenger.  Good reflexes, your Highness,&quot; she added with a wink.
     &quot;Errgh,&quot; Mina muttered as she glared at the white cat before sitting back
down in a huff.  &quot;Fine, he can sleep with you tonight.  Uh, wait, that didn&#39;t
sound right,&quot; she added a moment later, her expression turning pained.
     &quot;Mina....&quot; Leda sighed as she rested her elbows on the table and put her
face in her hands.
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Alex chuckled quietly as she tucked the white cat in the crook of
her arm and absently began to scratch his ears.  &quot;He&#39;ll have to run that past
Mich first, she tends to be a pillow hog most nights....&quot;
     Leda cringed slightly by reflex and glanced over her shoulder, trying to
see if Michelle was around.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say that too loudly, Alex,&quot; she said
in a warning tone.  &quot;No need to upset the significant other, y&#39;know?&quot;
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying....&quot;
     &quot;We know,&quot; Mina said smoothly as she flipped open to the current chapter
being taught in History class.  She paused for a moment as she was distracted
by the subtle and gentle motion of Serena&#39;s wings in her peripheral vision,
turning her head to get a better look at them.  &quot;Feeling better about being an
angel, Serena?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     Serena blinked in surprise at the question before sighing quietly.  &quot;No,&quot;
she murmured softly.  &quot;I was feeling.... confined earlier, which is why I felt
like I had to change.  I&#39;m worried about it now, about how long I&#39;ll be able to
keep it under control and hidden from everyone else....&quot;
     &quot;Just take it easy, Serena,&quot; Leda sighed as she reached out to gently rub
the blonde&#39;s bare shoulder.  &quot;We all know this is new, so of course it&#39;s going
to take some time getting used to.  I&#39;m sure Susan can sit down with you and
tell you all about how long it took her to adapt to having wings, just as soon
as she gets back from doing whatever.&quot;
     &quot;Good luck,&quot; Alex muttered, drawing a number of curious looks.  She paused
and looked up from Ami&#39;s homework assignment as she became aware of the shift
in focus and added, &quot;She&#39;s playing with paperwork today, which has been known
to keep her happily occupied for hours at a time.  Some days we think she has
to flip a coin to decide if she should go put a smile on some guard&#39;s face or
get her jollies by filing a stack of paperwork with one of the ministers.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks, Alex,&quot; Mina sighed.  &quot;I really needed that mental image.&quot;
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying,&quot; Alex protested.  &quot;Sue seems to like dealing with
the ins and outs of government as much as she likes the ins and outs of....&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Alex,&quot; three voices chorused in virtual unison.
     &quot;Uh, no problem....&quot; the Viking said in a dubious tone.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Mina said in a faintly edged tone.  She paused as the motion of
Serena&#39;s wings got her attention again, prompting a very quiet sigh.  &quot;So back
to the original topic.... just what precisely is worrying you, Serena?  Afraid
you&#39;ll sneeze one day and out comes the wings or what?&quot;
     Serena gave her fellow blonde an uneasy look at the phrasing before she
nodded slowly.  &quot;Something like that, yes,&quot; she admitted quietly.
     Mina simply gave her a charming smile and squeezed her wrist gently.  &quot;I
have a crazy question for you, girl.... you even try that before?  Letting your
angelic side show when you&#39;ve got a shirt on or something,&quot; she amended as she
saw a look of confusion in Serena&#39;s gold eyes.  &quot;I mean, it&#39;s one thing to be
changing bras in the gym and have a hard sneeze shake them loose, but what if
there isn&#39;t room for your wings to come out and play?  You don&#39;t see Susan
going all demonic on us with a bra on, right?&quot;
     Alex snorted quietly to herself.  &quot;I think Sue wears a bra less often than
I do,&quot; she muttered to Ami, prompting a very faint blush from the blue-haired
girl.  &quot;And lord knows she&#39;s the one who really needs her tits tied down....&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Alex,&quot; Ami sighed as her blush darkened by four shades.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Mina said, pointedly ignoring the comment.  &quot;Just go give it a
try, Serena.  Usual clothing, nothing too tight, but you don&#39;t want it falling
off on its own either.  Oh, umm.... nothing you truly want to keep, either,
just in case something does tear,&quot; she added with a sheepish look.  &quot;I can hook
you up with something from my closet that I wouldn&#39;t miss if it got ruined, if
you think you&#39;d need it.&quot;
     Serena blinked before she turned to give Leda an uncertain look, prompting
a casual shrug from the brunette.  &quot;Don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Leda replied.  &quot;I mean,
it sounds plausible in theory, but I would ask Susan about it first before I
try something that might poke a hole in a blouse or end up hurting yourself in
some way.  I mean, what if your wings do come out but there&#39;s no where for them
to go?&quot;
     &quot;Hey, where&#39;s Michelle?&quot; Alex spoke up as she glanced over her shoulder.
&quot;She might remember this better than I do.  I think Sue mentioned something in
passing once about how she was restricted from changing when she wore something
heavy across her back that couldn&#39;t be torn by her wings.  I&#39;m not sure if that
actually prevented her from changing, or if she avoided doing that because it
would screw with her wings somehow.&quot;
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t help,&quot; Leda pointed out.
     Alex shrugged to herself.  &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just passing along what I remember.
I know Sue said she modified her Sailor Suit in the back to allow her wings to
break through it, as otherwise it was too tough and needed to be sliced open
first.  Hey, umm, speaking of which....&quot; she added, suddenly seeming to be very
hesitant about something.  &quot;Can I ask you girls a personal question about the
designs of your suits?&quot;
     &quot;What design?&quot; Mina inquired.  &quot;They&#39;re all identical, save for the color
and the choice of footwear.&quot;
     Alex paused to cast an uneasy glance over her shoulder at the residential
hallway before gently clearing her throat.  &quot;Okay, I know I don&#39;t wear a bra
very often simply because I&#39;m flat-chested, but Mich uses one for support and
all, which is fine with me.  The problem we&#39;ve noticed is that when she goes to
transform into Sailor Neptune, her bra somehow doesn&#39;t make it.&quot;
     &quot;None of ours do,&quot; Leda muttered darkly.
     &quot;Wait, what?&quot; Alex said, blinking hard.  &quot;When did this start happening?&quot;
     &quot;From day one,&quot; Leda replied in wary tone.  &quot;Why am I getting the feeling
that we never had that problem before back in the Moon Kingdom?&quot;
     &quot;Because we didn&#39;t?&quot; the short-haired blonde said archly.  &quot;Seriously, you
mean to tell me that all this time here on Earth, you girls have been fighting
the Negaverse without bras in those suits?  Doesn&#39;t that chafe after awhile?&quot;
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Serena muttered darkly, the tips of her wings seeming
to shiver briefly.
     &quot;Now hold on,&quot; Alex protested as she sat down on the edge of the table and
rubbed her sinuses, completely oblivious to the fact that she was putting a
wrinkle in Ami&#39;s homework assignment and was incurring a truly evil glare from
the blue-haired girl.  &quot;Serena, you&#39;re the Crown Princess, you control the
Imperium Silver Crystal.  Why haven&#39;t you used it to modify the design, then?&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Serena said, giving her a startled look.  &quot;Umm.... how?&quot;
     Alex just stared at her in disbelief before sighing heavily.  &quot;Oh, for the
love of the Moon, your Highness....&quot;  She paused as she suddenly became aware
of the borderline lethal look off to her side and glanced over at Ami.  &quot;Uh,
what&#39;s with the evil eye, hon?  The deodorant gave out already or something?&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re sitting on my homework assignment,&quot; Ami said in a rather glacial
tone.  &quot;Please move before I have to kill you.  Thank you,&quot; she added as the
Viking promptly hopped off the table and edged away.
     &quot;Damn, babe,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s your turn to start going
all Rei on us....&quot;
     Mina just shook her head to herself.  &quot;That was wrong,&quot; she commented.
     &quot;So back to the suit issues,&quot; Leda said, casting a mild look at Artemis to
suggest that it would be in his best interests to continue to remain silent.
&quot;You&#39;re saying that Serena could fix this problem for us somehow?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m fairly sure she can,&quot; Alex replied as she set Artemis down on the
table, making sure she wasn&#39;t anywhere close to Ami&#39;s school work this time.
&quot;Granted you&#39;ll probably have to run it past Sue just to make sure, as I&#39;m sure
she can tell you all about the design modifications she&#39;s made over the years
and all, but last I checked such things are the domain of the Royal House.&quot;
     &quot;Serena,&quot; Artemis spoke up in a careful tone as he padded his way over to
her section of the table.  &quot;I know my memory about such things isn&#39;t what it
should be, but I think I have a good idea of what Alex is talking about.  You
remember awhile ago when Luna and I supercharged everyone&#39;s powers, and you had
to use the power of the Crystal to seal the new changes in place?&quot;
     &quot;Hmm....&quot; Serena said quietly to herself, the soft triple-tone harmonic
sounding quite pleasant to everyone else.  She blinked suddenly and glanced up
at the white cat with a slightly uneasy look on her face.  &quot;But that really
wasn&#39;t me doing it, it was.... her.&quot;
     &quot;Her?&quot; Artemis echoed in a very uncertain tone.
     &quot;The Moon Princess,&quot; Serena said in an almost inaudible whisper.
     &quot;Umm, Serena?&quot; Alex spoke up carefully.  &quot;You *are* the Moon Princess.&quot;
     Serena shook her head gently.  &quot;I know that, but.... in a way, I&#39;m not.
I can&#39;t explain it, it&#39;s like.... she&#39;s someone else who comes to visit every
now and then.  She knows things I don&#39;t, she remembers how to truly control the
Imperium Silver Crystal.  I&#39;m.... still learning,&quot; she admitted with a dark
blush of shame.
     Leda snorted quietly and crossed her arms over her ample chest.  &quot;Funny,
you seem to be doing a damn good job so far.  Okay, so you might not be able to
explain the whole process to anyone, but I think that your spirit knows how to
make it all work when it counts, even if you don&#39;t think you do.  C&#39;mon, when
did Luna take you aside and teach you how to raise your friends from the dead?&quot;
she pointed out as she leaned back in her chair.
     &quot;She has a point, Serena,&quot; Ami chimed in gently.  &quot;You do seem to be able
to get the Crystal to respond correctly in a crisis, even when you&#39;re asking it
to do something unorthodox or unique that hasn&#39;t been tried before.  Granted it
doesn&#39;t seem to be able to break certain universal laws of physics, but that
has never been an issue before.&quot;
     Alex nodded in agreement.  &quot;We&#39;re not trying to move heaven and Earth or
anything like that, your Highness,&quot; she added.  &quot;All I want is a decently soft
tit-cup for Michelle so she doesn&#39;t fuss about sore nipples in the shower, and
a minor redesign of my panties when I&#39;m transforming into Sailor Uranus so I
don&#39;t wind up with crotch rash after a ten-minute fight.&quot;
     There was a slight pause as five heavy sighs were heard in almost perfect
unison.  &quot;Must you be so vulgar?&quot; Ami muttered, her cheeks tinted a rather
fetching shade of dark pink.
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying the design is cut far too low,&quot; Alex protested as
she made a gesture to her upper thighs.  &quot;If it can be drawn up to here and
thinned out a touch in the front, to about this wide,&quot; she added with another
series of gestures, &quot;Then I don&#39;t chafe in four places when running.  I don&#39;t
have any issues with my Sailor Suit irritating my tits, so I don&#39;t need a bra.
And like I said, I&#39;m more worried about Mich&#39;s concerns than I am about mine.&quot;
     &quot;You might want to try looking into this, Serena,&quot; Leda said in a quiet
tone.  &quot;I don&#39;t know about the rest of you girls, but I really wouldn&#39;t mind a
little support for the twins when suiting up, and I&#39;m sure Rei would as well.
And not just because it all becomes visible when we get wet,&quot; she added sourly.
     &quot;Been there, done that, got leered at,&quot; Mina muttered.  &quot;And yes, support
would be nice, thought I&#39;d honestly have to ask for an underwire design rather
than a traditional back-and-shoulder harness.  Shoulder mobility,&quot; she added as
she caught the questioning looks from both Artemis and Ami.  &quot;It&#39;s a little on
the rough side to be running and jumping around when you&#39;ve got shoulder straps
digging into your skin,&quot; she explained.
     &quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Ami replied after a brief moment of thought.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; Serena said in a faintly uncertain tone.  &quot;I&#39;ll talk to Susan
about it the next time I see her.&quot;
     &quot;Talk to her about the communicators as well,&quot; Leda spoke up as a thought
came to her.  She leaned forward and dug a piece of scratch paper out of her
homework folder and started to scribble on it.  &quot;Hell, might as well make a
list of things we need to talk to her about, seeing how there seems to be more
than a few issues.  Sailor Suit designs, communicators.  What else?&quot;
     &quot;Those fantasy-bubble world things of her would be nice,&quot; Mina spoke up in
an openly speculative tone.  &quot;I&#39;m still not sure how they work, mind you, but
if we could create small virtual-realities as playgrounds....&quot;
     &quot;Gotcha,&quot; Leda said as she scribbled down another line.
     &quot;Bubble worlds?&quot; Artemis inquired, his eyebrows arched up.
     &quot;Long story, kitty,&quot; Alex said as she absently reached out to stroke his
tail.  &quot;I&#39;m sure Sue will explain it to you if you can pin her down in a comfy
chair for a few minutes.  Done already, babe?&quot; she added as Ami set her pen
down and sat back, carefully studying the chains of chemistry equations she had
written out.
     &quot;I think so,&quot; Ami said after a few moments of studious silence.
     &quot;That&#39;s Ami for you,&quot; Mina said as she turned her attention back to her
all-but-forgotten history assignment.  &quot;I&#39;m almost afraid to ask what other
subjects she completed before I could make it over here.&quot;
     &quot;Just her math assignment,&quot; Leda spoke up.
     &quot;Really bizarre math,&quot; Serena muttered.
     &quot;Trigonometry,&quot; Ami corrected with a faint hint of crispness to her tone.
     &quot;Ami, we really need to get you out more often,&quot; Mina sighed softly.
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m with the Princess on that one,&quot; Alex commented, casting a glance
over her shoulder as she heard approaching footsteps.  &quot;Don&#39;t ask me to follow
along with what Ami was doing to those triangles, it seemed pretty Greek to me.
Hey, hon,&quot; she added as Michelle quietly joined the group.  She blinked hard as
Michelle promptly grabbed her earlobe and started to gently but firmly drag her
back towards the residential hallway.  &quot;Ow, Mich!  What the hell!  OW!&quot;
     &quot;Let me show you what you did to the bathroom earlier,&quot; Michelle said in
a fairly level tone.
     &quot;I&#39;m not even going to ask,&quot; Mina murmured in a very low tone, casting a
sidelong glance towards the upset blonde being dragged into the hallway.  &quot;I
know there&#39;s a few things I&#39;d consider smacking Maze around for, but those are
all typical guy habits like their issue with toilet seats.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll make you a bet,&quot; Leda said as she stretched, putting a significant
strain on the front of her blouse for a moment.  &quot;Michelle strikes me as the
quiet but slightly prissy type, so I&#39;ll bet it has to do with soap scum in the
tub or something of that nature.  You know, something that can be washed down
the drain in ten seconds if you deal with it while it&#39;s still wet.&quot;
     &quot;No bet,&quot; Mina replied in an airy tone with a small smile.
     &quot;Spoilsport,&quot; the brunette grumbled as she turned her attention back to
her homework assignment.  She blinked and lifted her head up a moment later as
she heard a muted beeping noise from somewhere, glancing over at Mina just as
the blonde discreetly checked something in her pocket.  &quot;Mina, what sort of toy
are you playing with now?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     &quot;Oh, umm.... nothing, really,&quot; Mina replied, seeming to be distracted for
a moment.  &quot;Just a little device I picked up awhile ago that comes in handy
every so often.&quot;
     &quot;Tripwire went off already, hmm?&quot; Artemis muttered, causing the rest of
the group to blink hard.
     &quot;It&#39;s early, he&#39;s probably just checking it out ahead of time,&quot; Mina said
with a dismissive wave of her hand.  She started to turn her attention back to
her textbook when she realized that everyone else was looking at her with
varying degrees of curiosity, concern, and suspicion.  &quot;What?&quot; she asked in a
tone of casual innocence.
     &quot;Tripwire?&quot; Ami echoed in a faintly edged tone.
     The blonde looked at her before glancing over at the visibly uneasy look
on Serena&#39;s face, prompting a very quiet sigh of resignation.  &quot;Okay, look,&quot;
she said in a low tone.  &quot;There are two reasons why I didn&#39;t come here right
away with the rest of you guys after school.  The first was to grab Artemis.&quot;
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Serena said quietly as she reflexively glanced towards the front
door of the cathedral.  &quot;Maybe I should have picked up Luna earlier....&quot;
     &quot;She&#39;ll be fine, she&#39;s probably out having a good time with Hercules or
something, if you know what I mean,&quot; Mina replied with an absent gesture of
dismissal, ignoring the pained looks from the rest of the group at the mental
image.  &quot;Anyway, the other reason was to put one of Sailor V&#39;s toys to use, in
this case an electronic sensor placed inside the church where she&#39;s going to be
meeting with Jedyt soon.  It&#39;ll send a signal to the receiver here whenever it
gets tripped,&quot; she said, patting the small device in her skirt pocket.  She
paused for a moment as it beeped softly again, prompting another momentary
delay as she discreetly checked the tiny LED readout.  &quot;That&#39;s probably him on
his way out,&quot; she ventured absently.  &quot;It&#39;s what I did, really, a simple and
brief stick-your-head-inside-and-look-around survey before leaving to go back
to your usual business.&quot;
     &quot;Should we ask where you got that from?&quot; Leda inquired cautiously.
     Mina shrugged theatrically and turned back to her textbook.  &quot;Sailor V has
many friends,&quot; she said lightly.  &quot;One happens to like tinkering with all sorts
of electrical and electronic gadgets as a hobby.  This didn&#39;t work the way he
wanted it to, by the way, which is why he didn&#39;t have any concerns about giving
it to me.  I&#39;m trying to convince him to open up a small store to sell some of
those toys he makes, but he says he&#39;s not interested in the hassle.  A shame,
really, some of what I&#39;ve seen could be sold for a serious penny if the right
buyer can be found.&quot;
     &quot;Right,&quot; Ami said in a faintly suspicious tone.
     &quot;Settle down, Bubbles,&quot; Mina countered, casting a sidelong glance at her.
&quot;I&#39;m not running around like I&#39;m Batman&#39;s illegitimate daughter with all sorts
of neat James Bond-like gadgets tucked into my panties, okay?  I just happen to
have a few really useful tools at my disposal.  I&#39;m sure you could easily build
a detachable electronic tripwire sensor module for your own toy computer if you
were of a mind to do so, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m walking off with black-market
military technology or anything even remotely close.&quot;  A sweet smile crossed
her face as she leaned forward and added, &quot;And trust me.... I&#39;ve tried.&quot;
     &quot;She&#39;s not kidding, is she?&quot; Serena asked Artemis in a low tone.
     &quot;Nope,&quot; the white cat sighed.
     &quot;C&#39;mon, even you said those night-vision goggles would be useful,&quot; Mina
protested with a small pout.
     &quot;Yeah, and I&#39;m sure that military supply sergeant would have been quite
upset if they had walked off,&quot; Artemis countered dryly.  &quot;Giving a cute girl
first-dibs on military surplus is one thing, but some things just aren&#39;t for
sale yet.  Like he said, you&#39;ll probably be able to legally get your hands on
one in a few years.  We already had that very lengthy discussion about what I
fully expect you not to do, and stealing from the military is on the top of the
list.  Even vigilante crime-fighters have to respect the law to an extent for
the police to be inclined to overlook certain less-than-legal activities.&quot;
     &quot;Mina....&quot; Ami sighed quietly as she put her head in her hands.
     &quot;Ami, how many criminals have you arrested?&quot; Mina inquired casually as she
looked down at her textbook and flipped a page.
     &quot;Do the minions of Queen Beryl count?&quot; Ami replied in a wary tone.
     &quot;Nope,&quot; Mina answered lightly.  &quot;I mean fully-human, law-breaking dirtbags
who might have otherwise gotten away with their crimes had somebody not been
able to intervene in time.  You know, crimes like assault, attempted murder,
attempted rape, robbery, attempted robbery, drug-pushing, fun things like that.
The way I look at it some days, usually when I&#39;m in a pissy mood, uptight and
sanctimonious, holier-than-thou people like you should be down on your KNEES,
thanking V for putting her life on the line for the sake of people she doesn&#39;t
even know and half of whom probably wouldn&#39;t have given her the time of day a
mere five minutes before their world was rocked by some thug with a nylon over
his ugly mug.&quot;
     Everyone blinked hard at the sudden shift in her tone halfway through her
diatribe, edging back slightly as Mina&#39;s head came up to fix a truly piercing
stare at Ami.  &quot;Ask Artemis,&quot; she said in a dangerously flat tone.  &quot;Ask him
how I was about thirty seconds away from an almost certain death if he hadn&#39;t
empowered those glasses with as much Lunar energy as he could without killing
himself.  Then ask him about all the good that Sailor V has done with her new
powers since then, and not just smacking around rogue denizens.  Ask him about
the lives she&#39;s saved, both in England and here in Japan, and all the money
raised for children&#39;s charities.  Ask him how many young and impressionable
kids these days look up to her as a role model, about how her influence has
helped so many.  Then I *dare* you look me straight in the eye and try to rake
her over the coals over what she has to do some nights to get the job done.&quot;
     &quot;Mina,&quot; Artemis spoke up very quietly.  He waited for the worst of her
sudden burst of anger to bleed off before continuing.  &quot;Just take it easy, we
all know that Sailor V is one of the good guys.  However, even you have to
admit that she can be a true wild card at times, and we both know that never
sits well with those who prefer a little more predictability in their lives,&quot;
he said, casting a neutral look towards Ami.  &quot;And Ami?  You really do need to
cut her some slack every now and then,&quot; he added gently.  &quot;I&#39;ve got my eye on
her, and she can tell you that there have been times where a gentle nudge was
called for to put her back onto a slightly straighter path.&quot;
     &quot;Gentle nudge?&quot; Mina echoed in a dangerously soft whisper as she began to
read her homework assignment in apparent earnest.
     Artemis paused for a few moments to lick his whiskers.  &quot;Yeah, what?&quot; he
ventured in an extremely leery tone.
     &quot;The last time you &#39;nudged&#39; me on an issue, it took three days for the
claw marks on my butt to heal,&quot; Mina pointed out in a flat tone, casting a very
brief sidelong glance at the white cat.
     Artemis sat back and sighed, suppressing the urge to roll his eyes.  &quot;Oh,
here we go again,&quot; he moaned.  &quot;I already told you this several times, I only
used my claws on you because you were sitting on my tail and wouldn&#39;t move.
Let&#39;s not get started on all the things you&#39;ve done to me when you didn&#39;t like
what I was saying when I put my paw down.&quot;
     &quot;Like what?&quot; Mina demanded as she turned away from her textbook to glare
at him, oblivious to the sudden look of unease being shared between Ami, Leda,
and Serena at the shift in tension.
     &quot;Let&#39;s see,&quot; Artemis said with a yawn.  &quot;You&#39;ve duct-taped me to the door
of your closet, threw me into your laundry hamper and set the TV on top of the
lid, tossed me into the toilet and flushed on more than one occasion, dyed my
fur purple of all things....&quot;
     &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Mina protested, &quot;The purple dye incident was an accident.
Even you thought it looked like the bottle of shampoo at first....&quot;
     Leda sighed quietly and looked over her shoulder as she heard a noise,
raising one eyebrow at the look on Alex&#39;s face as she made her way back to the
dining room table.  &quot;Everything okay?&quot; she inquired cautiously.
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Alex grumbled as she sat down at the table.  &quot;She was just ticked
that I trimmed the short hairs earlier and not all of the fluff got washed into
the drain like I thought.  Umm, are they okay?&quot; she added as she gestured to
the almost casual way in which Mina and Artemis were arguing back and forth.
     Leda cast a dour look at Ami before shaking her head to herself.  &quot;They&#39;re
fine, they&#39;re just bleeding off a bit of stress from earlier, that&#39;s all.  I
take it someone showed you how to use a safety razor?&quot; she ventured.
     &quot;What?  Oh, nah,&quot; Alex replied with an absent wave of her hand.  &quot;Sue was
kind enough to pack our blades in with the rest of the toiletries that she said
she was able to recover from the Moon Kingdom.  I tried using that foam stuff
Whisper mentioned but it came out as this green goop that smelled bad, so I
just grabbed the lather kit instead.&quot;
     &quot;Whoa, whoa, wait,&quot; Mina said as she held up a finger to Artemis.  &quot;Hold
that thought for one second, okay?  Thanks.  Run this one past me again,&quot; she
said as she turned to Alex with a slightly queasy look.  &quot;Did you just say that
you used a straight-razor to trim your pubic hair?  Quiet,&quot; she added as she
reached out to flatten Artemis&#39; muzzle against the hard surface of the table.
     &quot;Errrr..... mgkay,&quot; he murmured as his tail started to twitch.
     &quot;Hey, I told you the cut of the panties in my Sailor Suit is messed up,&quot;
Alex replied with a sour look.  &quot;I was getting friction burn from the elastic,
and having it snarl the carpeting was making things worse, so I just trimmed it
back a half-inch or so.&quot;
     &quot;But with a *STRAIGHT-RAZOR?*&quot; Mina protested, her eyes widening.
     Alex glanced over at Leda and Serena before shrugging helplessly.  &quot;What
else was I supposed to use, babe?  It&#39;s worked just fine for the past four or
five years.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s brave,&quot; Leda admitted quietly.  &quot;Mina, you might want to let the
cat up for air before he claws you again.&quot;
     &quot;Hmm?  Oh, sorry,&quot; Mina said as she let go of Artemis&#39; head, allowing him
to breathe properly through his nose once again.  &quot;Yes, that is brave.  One
wrong move down there and you&#39;ll wind up with a second..... uh, Ami?&quot; she said
as the blue-hair girl stood up with a heavy sigh and collected her textbooks
together.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m going to go study in a quieter place,&quot; Ami said briskly.  &quot;Preferably
one where I don&#39;t have to listen to such impolite conversations about personal
business.  What?&quot; she growled in a truly dark tone as Leda gently pressed down
on her shoulders, pushing her back down into the chair.
     &quot;Why don&#39;t we all take five, okay?&quot; the brunette suggested softly as she
began to lightly knead the tense muscles in Ami&#39;s neck.  &quot;Call it a study break
or something.  Not to say that it wasn&#39;t broken to begin with for the past ten
minutes or so, but still.  Settle down and relax, okay?  You, however, need to
start studying,&quot; she said to Mina in a gentle but commanding tone.
     Mina glanced over at the dark look on Ami&#39;s face before sighing quietly.
&quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve still got a couple of hours to kill before I go deal with Jedyt,&quot;
she murmured as she turned back to her textbook.
     Alex tilted her head to one side as she idly scratched her jaw, absently
eyeing the way Leda&#39;s hands were skillfully working over Ami&#39;s neck muscles.
&quot;Remind me again how that&#39;s going to work, babe?&quot; she prodded cautiously.
     Mina continued to look down at her textbook for a few moments before she
sighed softly and closed her eyes.  &quot;I keep telling you, I&#39;m not going to do
anything, Sailor V is,&quot; she pointed out in a muted tone.  &quot;The general plan,
pardon the pun, is to see what the hell he&#39;s doing this time.  Only this time,
if he&#39;s up to no good?  He&#39;s dead,&quot; she promised as she opened her eyes to give
the Viking a somber and serious look.  &quot;Patience is a virtue and all, but all
kidding aside about losing my virtue to Maze, my patience with him is pretty
much played out.&quot;
     &quot;Can&#39;t you just kill him and be done with it?&quot; Ami muttered darkly, the
scowl on her face slowly fading away as Leda continued to lightly massage the
tension out of her neck.
     &quot;Please,&quot; Serena added, her own expression tainted with bitterness.
     Mina just shook her head and reached out to scoop up Artemis.  &quot;Sorry, we
made a deal,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;We talk first, then we see what happens after that.
And aren&#39;t you two usually the first ones to jump on my case about going off
half-cocked and shooting first before asking questions?&quot; she added, one blonde
eyebrow arching up in mild unamusement.
     &quot;It&#39;s Jedyt,&quot; Serena muttered as she glanced away.  She blinked and held
still as she felt Alex&#39;s hands lightly rubbing her upper back, seeming to be
trying to mimic the movements of Leda&#39;s hands on Ami&#39;s neck.  Her fingertips
were more than a little cold, but it became obvious after a few moments that
the short-haired blonde had more than a fair idea of how massage worked.
     &quot;Easy, starlight,&quot; Alex said softly.  &quot;No need to get your panties all in
a knot over it.  Like I said, just point me to him and give the word, and I&#39;ll
go lop off both his head and his balls for you.&quot;
     &quot;He doesn&#39;t have any balls,&quot; Ami grumbled quietly as she closed her eyes.
     &quot;Hey, c&#39;mon,&quot; Artemis protested quietly.  &quot;Have just a little decency here
and leave the guy&#39;s cajones out of this one.  You&#39;re Sailor Scouts, there&#39;s no
need for unnecessary roughness and hitting below the belt.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re actually defending him,&quot; Alex said sourly.
     The cat just sighed and gave her a slightly pained look.  &quot;It&#39;s a guy
thing, okay?  Just let that one go, please.  Hmmmmmrrrrrrr,&quot; he purred softly
as Mina began to scratch him behind the ears.
     &quot;So anyway, what homework do you have left, your Highness?&quot; Alex asked
absently as she glanced down at Serena&#39;s exposed back, giving the glowing wings
a very studious look.  She blinked as she was answered with a petulant groan
that needed little translation, bringing a faint hint of a smile to her lips
even as she felt a pang of regret at reminding the winged blonde that she still
wasn&#39;t finished studying yet.  &quot;I&#39;m just asking, that&#39;s all....&quot;
     &quot;Linear algebra and two writing compositions,&quot; Serena sighed.
     &quot;Which subjects?&quot; Ami spoke up, her eyes still closed as she started to
unconsciously lean back against Leda.
     &quot;World War II and a summary of some story read in class earlier,&quot; Serena
replied in a faintly sleepy tone.  &quot;Something about a Roman emperor getting
killed by a conspiracy.&quot;
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Alex said thoughtfully.  &quot;I think I know this one.  One of those
salad emperors, right?  Juice something?&quot;
     &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; Ami said in a very pained tone.
     &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s him,&quot; Alex replied with a nod.  &quot;&#39;Eat this, you brute,&#39; or
something like that.  Sue told us the story a few times, but I never really
paid too much attention to the details.  I know he made a really good salad,
though, especially with the right croutons.  Uh, Leda?  I think you&#39;re rubbing
her neck too hard,&quot; she pointed out as Ami groaned softly and slumped forward,
letting her forehead lightly bump against the edge of the table.
     &quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; Leda muttered as she started to massage her own neck.
     &quot;Okay, so maybe Ami&#39;s not the only one who needs to get out more,&quot; Mina
commented quietly to Artemis as she tried to lose herself in the historical
world of life in the late nineteenth century.
     &quot;What?&quot; Alex inquired in an uncertain tone.
     Leda just shook her head as she set her algebra homework aside and dug
around in her backpack for her literature textbook.  &quot;Have a seat, Alex,&quot; she
suggested as she flipped pages until she came across the section dealing with
the Shakespearian story of the life and death of Julius Caesar.  &quot;It seems like
you&#39;re in a need of a refresher as well.  Here, read.  You might want to pay
attention too, Serena, if you have to write about this.  See, it all starts
back in Rome with these two Roman officials....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     Sirene stood in front of the conference room door and tried to keep her
cybernetic vision on both ends of the hallway at the same time, clearly not in
the least bit happy with the current situation.  There were six guards in total
that she could detect, only four of which she could see in the visible light
spectrum without resorting to using her optical implants to pick up the other
pair of thermal traces through the walls.  None of them were overly close to
her, the nearest being a good dozen yards away, but it was still more than
enough to give her a distinctly unsettled feeling.
     She reflexively glanced behind her as she heard yet another heavy metallic
sound coming from the conference room where Ar&#39;kanis was changing out of his
flight suit and back into his heavy armor.  Seeing his thermal trace through
the door was a fairly trivial task, but she couldn&#39;t quite make out the lines
of his armor well enough to discern how much longer he would need.  The guards
had assured her that they wouldn&#39;t be disturbed until he was ready, but there
had been an undercurrent of resentment to the tone that only added to her sense
of unease at the situation.
     And of course he asked me to leave the pistol in the cockpit, she thought
to herself with a faint buzzing sigh.  She paused and blinked as her implants
registered a new thermal trace, watching carefully as the woman made her way
down a corridor and into the main hallway where she could be seen using the
visible light spectrum.
     &lt;Sir, hurry up,&gt; she muttered softly to herself as she cast yet another
quick glance behind her.  She sighed as he seemed to be taking his time in
putting his armor back on, his draconic wings flexing back and forth as if he
were stretching them out.  The sound of a pair of approaching boots caused her
to refocus on the new arrival, snapping to perfect attention as she drew close
enough for the silver stars on her collar to be seen.  &lt;Ma&#39;am,&gt; she said, her
vocoder making her voice perfectly flat and devoid of emotion.
     Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren seemed to pause for a moment before returning the
salute.  &quot;Major.... Sirene, is it?&quot; she said in a calm voice.  &quot;Welcome back to
the Imperial Castle.  I trust he is waiting for me?&quot; she added with a gesture
of her chin to the conference room.
     Sirene hesitated for a moment before squaring her shoulders.  &lt;Ma&#39;am, the
general is still changing out of his flight suit at the moment, so I can&#39;t let
you in just yet.&gt;
     &quot;Understandable,&quot; Si&#39;ren admitted as she glanced at the closed door for a
moment before turning her attention back to the other woman.  &quot;Forgive me if I
seem testy at the moment, but with events being what they have been as of late,
I am not exactly in the mood for further surprises.  What is the purpose of
your visit?&quot;
     &lt;Ma&#39;am?&gt; Sirene said, her forehead wrinkling slightly.  &lt;I&#39;m just the
aircraft pilot for this one, and my orders were to bring him here for your
meeting.&gt;
     &quot;What meeting, Major?&quot; Si&#39;ren prodded in a wary tone.  &quot;Until you set off
a division-wide Raid Watch with your stealthed approach, I wasn&#39;t aware that
such a meeting had been scheduled or even contemplated.&quot;  Her white eyebrows
arched up as she was answered with a flat burst of static from Sirene&#39;s vocoder
that she wasn&#39;t entirely sure she wanted to have translated.
     &lt;Ma&#39;am, forgive my bluntness, but do you mean to tell me that you weren&#39;t
expecting to meet with General Ar&#39;kanis today?&gt; Sirene inquired in as delicate
a tone as her synthetic voice could manage.
     &quot;No, Major, I was not,&quot; Si&#39;ren said firmly.  &quot;I sense this is a bit of a
surprise for you as well?&quot; she added as Sirene closed her eyes, very slowly
curling and uncurling her hands into fists.
     &lt;He&#39;s walking home,&gt; Sirene growled darkly.  &lt;Now I know why he asked me
to leave my pistol in the aircraft, it&#39;s so I don&#39;t kill him.  My apologies,
ma&#39;am, I was under the impression that we were somewhat expected,&gt; she added
as she opened her eyes and gave the admiral an uneasy look.
     Si&#39;ren sighed softly and reached up to rub her face with her hands.  &quot;If
the situation wasn&#39;t so dire, Major, I might otherwise be amused by this,&quot; she
admitted in a weary tone.  &quot;One Negaverse soldier to another.... just what the
hell is going on in your division?&quot;
     Sirene paused for a few moments to choose her words carefully, fully aware
that she was a mid-rank Red Wing officer dealing with the highest-ranking naval
officer in the military chain-of-command, and one who likely was quite unhappy
with the Red Wings as a division.  &lt;Ma&#39;am, as far as I personally can tell as
a Red Wing,&gt; she said slowly, &lt;It seems to be an issue between General Rune and
General Nop&#39;tera.  I believe General Ar&#39;kanis may have come here to meet with
you to try to sort things out as quietly as possible.  With all due respect,
ma&#39;am, you&#39;ll have to ask him to be sure.&gt;
     &quot;Believe me, I will,&quot; Si&#39;ren promised.  Both she and Sirene looked up as
the door hissed open, framing the heavy bulk of Ar&#39;kanis&#39; armor in the doorway.
&quot;Ah, timing,&quot; the admiral commented absently.
     &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said as he saluted sharply, the sepulchral echo
of his helmet seeming to sound unusually loud to Sirene&#39;s ears.
     &quot;General,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied as she returned the formal salute.  &quot;As I was
just saying to your pilot, I hope you will forgive me if my patience is rather
short at the moment given recent events.  Why are you here?&quot;
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, I&#39;m sure you are aware of the tension between General Rune and
General Nop&#39;tera,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly.  &quot;I seek to end it, preferably as
quickly and painlessly as possible, and I believe I will need your help to do
this as I doubt General Rune would be willing to negotiate with me directly.&quot;
     &quot;Negotiate what, General?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired carefully.
     &quot;Peace,&quot; was the simple reply.
     &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out.
     &quot;Perhaps you would wish to sit and discuss this?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis suggested as he
stepped back and made a gesture to the conference room.  &quot;I find that even when
patience is short and time is of the essence, it is still easier on everyone
involved to be seated for a calm and rational discussion.&quot;
     &quot;And if I don&#39;t have time for this?&quot; the admiral asked casually.
     &quot;With all due respect, Admiral.... you may wish to make time,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
countered calmly.  &quot;I have been allotted three days for this endeavor, after
which I can make no further guarantees as to what the V&#39;ral will do, but for
the moment I can assure you that you will face no threat from the Red Wings
while I am here and unharmed.&quot;
     &quot;Really, now,&quot; Si&#39;ren said carefully.
     &quot;Admiral....&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said, lowering his voice to a very quiet rumble.
&quot;This is my own initiative, not Nop&#39;tera&#39;s.  I only know of one side of the
story, of General Rune&#39;s attack on Nop&#39;tera, but even I can see that there is
far more to this than is readily apparent.  Even so, there are more important
matters brewing on the horizon that will need our attention, and I think it
best that we be united as one cohesive military entity in order to meet and
counter this threat than to risk disaster while fighting amongst ourselves like
little children.  For this, I am more than willing to put pride aside and to
try to convince Nop&#39;tera to do the same as well.... but only if there is some
genuine reciprocation and agreement on General Rune&#39;s part.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren looked at him in silence for a number of moments before very slowly
nodding her head in understanding.  &quot;Yes, I suppose she would be concerned with
the question of the Moon Princess as well,&quot; she said quietly.
     &quot;Moon Princess?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said cautiously, his helmet making the faintest
of rasping sounds as it was tilted.  &quot;While I understand that her captivity
here was a source of contention between the military and the Sailor Scouts from
the planet Earth, I fail to see how that would impact the impending crisis in
the Hinterland rift-world.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Si&#39;ren said, her own eyebrows arching up slightly.  &quot;You mean with
the exploding moon?  That concerns her more than the Moon Princess?&quot;
     A very soft rumble rose up from the depths of Ar&#39;kanis&#39; helmet.  &quot;I sense
a disconnect somewhere between our perspectives, and that does not bode well.
Forgive me if I seem uninformed, Admiral, for while I am normally kept just as
informed as Nop&#39;tera is, there are sometimes things that escape my awareness,
either by accident or by the design of others.  What precisely is the nature of
your concern regarding Earth&#39;s Moon Princess?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren paused for several moments as she regarded him very carefully.
&quot;General Ar&#39;kanis, please tell me that you are intelligent enough to figure out
what will happen once the general population learns of her heritage,&quot; she said
in a faintly edged tone.
     Ar&#39;kanis suddenly became as motionless as a statue, not even seeming to
breathe for a number of moments.  &quot;Admiral, perhaps I am not nearly as aware of
events as I should be,&quot; he said in a very slow and openly uneasy tone.  &quot;I ask
for your indulgence by elaborating your concerns in a little more detail, as I
have no personal knowledge of the Moon Princess&#39; heritage, save that she is
obviously the daughter of an Earth king or queen.&quot;
     &lt;Sir, if I may?&gt; Sirene suddenly spoke up, trying her best to ignore the
sensation of her blood turning to slush at the realization that Nop&#39;tera hadn&#39;t
told him yet.
     &quot;If you can inform me, Major, then by all means please do so,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
said calmly, absently fluttering his draconic wings slightly.
     Sirene paused to take a deep breath, making sure to do so slowly enough so
as not to cause a burst of static from her vocoder.  &lt;Sir, Princess Serena is
a hybrid, half-human and half-denizen.&gt;
     Both Si&#39;ren and Sirene blinked hard as Ar&#39;kanis&#39; armored hand suddenly
shot out to grab the doorframe, gripping it hard enough to make the metallic
gauntlet creak in protest.  &quot;A hybrid, Major?&quot; he said slowly, his voice taking
on an audible tone of shock that not even the chilling echo-effect could erase.
&quot;Are you quite certain of this?&quot;
     &quot;We are,&quot; Si&#39;ren said carefully.  &quot;We had a pair of Healers confirm that
the Chaos Factor was in her blood, and that it was trying to become active in
the hours before this nonsense started.  With all due respect, General, how can
you be General Nop&#39;tera&#39;s executive officer and not be told of something that
is clearly of major global significance?&quot;
     It took Ar&#39;kanis a moment to respond, still gripping the doorframe.  He
very slowly let go, his hand edging away to reveal a series of indentations in
the frame where his strength had started to compress the metal.  &quot;I.... do not
know when Nop&#39;tera was made aware of this,&quot; he said, still clearly rattled by
the realization.  &quot;But in her defense, she has been quite preoccupied since the
V&#39;ral landed and.... indisposed since her confrontation with General Rune.  I
do not recall many opportunities in which such a thing could have been spoken
of or discussed in private.  Are you aware of anything further, Major?&quot; he
added, almost as an afterthought while he continued to fight an internal battle
to remain calm.
     Sirene cast an uneasy glance at Si&#39;ren before she drew in another breath.
&lt;Sir, I only know of this because I was tasked to help guard the Moon Princess
while she was in the Royal Medical Suite,&gt; she said carefully.  &lt;We were all
given orders by General Nop&#39;tera herself not to discuss the matter.&gt;
     &quot;Then I order you to discuss it now,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said without hesitation.
&quot;I will ensure that you do not suffer from any repercussions on Nop&#39;tera&#39;s part
as you are now obeying a direct order from a superior officer.  Speak, Major.&quot;
     &lt;Sir, General Nop&#39;tera said that the Princess was part of the NegaForce&#39;s
plan for the reconstruction of the monarchy, and that.... paraphrasing things
here, sir.... that she could be the one who either saves the world or ends up
destroying it.&gt;
     Si&#39;ren grumbled quietly to herself as she rubbed the bridge of her nose.
&quot;That she can, or at least the latter half of that statement,&quot; she sighed very
softly.  &quot;Or if not her personally, then at least her Sailor Scouts.&quot;  She
suddenly froze in mid-motion and looked up at them, alternating her gaze back
and forth between Ar&#39;kanis and Sirene.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose either if you two
knows what Nop&#39;tera intends to do with regards to the Moon Princess?&quot;
     A very soft grunt rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; helmet.  &quot;If Nop&#39;tera believes
that the Moon Princess will play a key role in a plan explained to her by the
NegaForce, then I have every reason to believe she will do whatever she can to
see that the plan is executed as the NegaForce desires,&quot; he rumbled.  &quot;She has
said more than once that she views herself as a loyal minion of both the throne
and the NegaForce, and I for one see no reason to doubt the strength of her
personal convictions.  If the NegaForce wills it, she will act.&quot;
     &quot;So that&#39;s it,&quot; Si&#39;ren breathed quietly as she moved to lean against the
nearest wall.  &quot;Rune wants Sailor Moon dead, and if Nop&#39;tera not only wants to
keep her alive but use her to bring back the monarchy....&quot;
     &quot;I see we have a starting point for negotiating an agreement,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
said in a disturbingly calm tone, drawing a dark look from the admiral.
     &quot;If Nop&#39;tera is just as unyielding as Rune is on certain issues, I fear
that trying to &#39;negotiate&#39; anything between us would be somewhere between an
academic discussion and an exercise in futility, neither of which I have the
time for,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied in a faint tone of warning.  &quot;And in any case, I have
my doubts about being able to get Rune to agree to anything in the end.&quot;
     &quot;Admiral, please listen to me,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a quiet tone.  &quot;Surely
you realize the danger we are all in at the moment.  This situation between
Rune and Nop&#39;tera simply cannot be allowed to continue lest it destroy us all.
I was not born in this world, but my blood nonetheless stems from it and it is
to be my home, and I should not like to see it become a casualty of war.  Some
have said that when two ter&#39;akas fight for dominance, it is the turf that they
are fighting over that is ultimately vanquished.  I have never seen a ter&#39;aka
before or know how they fight, but I can understand the wisdom in the words.
     &quot;I have taken considerable risks in coming here to try to meet with you,
risking not just my life but the lives of others in order to try to stop this
madness before it truly spirals out of control.  It might already be too late
given the missile strike on the V&#39;ral.... the third such attempt at destroying
it, I might add.... but....&quot;
     &quot;General?&quot; Si&#39;ren interrupted with a gesture of her hand, her face forming
into a dark frown.  &quot;What were the previous two attempts, then?&quot;
     &quot;The missile launch when we emerged from the rift was the first,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis
replied carefully.  &quot;The aborted attack from the Dragoon Legion&#39;s Headquarters
was the second.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Si&#39;ren blurted as she pushed herself off the wall, her eyes almost
tripling in diameter.  &quot;You say the *DRAGOONS* tried to attack you?&quot;
     &quot;Not knowingly, or so they would have us believe,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a very
uneasy tone, not fully sure of what to make of Si&#39;ren&#39;s reaction.  &quot;From what
I understand, someone had reprogrammed their orbital satellite&#39;s targeting
computer to track the V&#39;ral instead of the designated bombing range.  Had they
actually fired their weapon, we might not be having this conversation at the
moment.  Forgive me, Admiral, but I would have thought that you would have been
informed of such an incident as that....&quot;
     Both Ar&#39;kanis and Sirene blinked as the admiral growled softly to herself.
&quot;Damn her,&quot; she fumed quietly.  She glanced up at Ar&#39;kanis and sighed.  &quot;Keep
in mind this happened before I had to assume command of the military and thus
had to watch over more than just the Navy.  Had a naval unit been involved in
anything like that I surely would have heard of it, but who would bother a Navy
commander over a glitch in some ground-based Army Intel unit&#39;s computer?  Rune
never said a word of it to me.&quot;
     A very soft grunt rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; armored chest.  &quot;It seems that I
am not the only one who is occasionally less than informed,&quot; he rumbled.  &quot;This
does not bode well, Admiral, for it likely means that much more has taken place
behind the scenes than we were previously aware of.  And the latest incident?&quot;
     &quot;Rune&#39;s orders to the missile facility were quite explicit about how they
were NOT to load the fuse into the warhead,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied flatly.  &quot;That was
recorded on both her data terminal and in the outgoing transmission itself.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said, his eyebrows arching up.  &quot;You will, I trust, provide
verifiable copies of that transmission for our own analysis?&quot;
     &quot;Once Internal Review is done, yes,&quot; Si&#39;ren said with a nod.
     The tank general nodded slowly.  &quot;If it can be proven that General Rune
did not, in fact, order the missile strike on the V&#39;ral after her confrontation
with Nop&#39;tera, that may go a considerable way towards easing tensions.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren snorted bitterly and crossed her arms over her chest.  &quot;I&#39;m not so
sure about that,&quot; she countered.  &quot;Rune ordered the missile launched so that it
would only appear to be a nuclear warhead to your sensors.  The overall intent
was to force you to lift off, at which point things would still have gotten
distinctly unpleasant.&quot;
     &quot;The Castle&#39;s defensive artillery?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired.  He got a sour nod
in reply and sighed heavily to himself.  &quot;If I may, Admiral, you are not making
this any easier on me.  No doubt that Nop&#39;tera will still feel.... offended
that Rune was actively and deliberately attempting to kill her.  Again.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure Rune didn&#39;t appreciate you nuking a good portion of our Eastern
Frontier&#39;s reconnaissance units after you emerged from the Hinterland rift,&quot;
the Fleet Admiral replied tartly.  &quot;Even I have yet to understand why that was
deemed to be necessary.&quot;
     A soft sigh drifted up from his helmet.  &quot;We were on the highest stage of
alert at the time due to the potential for a last-second insurgent attack from
the Renn as we entered the rift,&quot; he rumbled.  &quot;The missile attack caught us
off-guard and our weapons officer counter-struck before we realized that it was
a denizen military unit firing on us and not a Renn unit.  While we are on the
subject in question, ma&#39;am, we have yet to receive an official explanation for
that incident as well,&quot; he added in a faintly cool tone.
     Si&#39;ren blinked as she realized that she hadn&#39;t the slightest idea of what
that particular investigation had revealed, if anything.  &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she
admitted with just the faintest hint of a blush.  &quot;Again, that was an internal
Army investigation and not a Navy one, and nobody ever said anything about it
to me.  But yes, I think you are owed an explanation.  I will have one for you
as soon as I find out for myself,&quot; she promised.  &quot;Assuming there is one,&quot; she
added darkly as she cast a glance over her shoulder.
     &quot;If I may, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said gently, returning her focus to him, &quot;I
submit that this merely more proof that whatever is at hand, it is not the
machinations of the military as a whole but rather General Rune personally.  If
that truly is the situation, and if I can be presented with concrete evidence
of this, then I can guarantee that Nop&#39;tera will not seek retribution on you or
any other uninvolved individual.  What I am starting to fear, however, is that
there are more hands at work here than simply General Rune&#39;s.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren studied him very carefully before slowly nodding her head.  &quot;I fear
you may be right,&quot; she said in a low tone.  &quot;But what scares me the most to
contemplate is that it might not be another denizen hand trying to guide our
path, but a human one.&quot;
     &quot;The Moon Princess?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis asked in a puzzled tone.  &quot;You fear her?&quot;
     &quot;Did you see the blast crater when you flew in?&quot; Si&#39;ren replied.  &quot;I saw
what it looks like from orbit, and it looks like a crescent moon shape to me.
I find it very, very disturbing to hear that the Moon Princess warned Rune of
the consequences of her death, only to have this happen to us shortly after she
winds up essentially brain-dead thanks to Rune.  I heard from the Healer who
went with the Sailor Scouts when they rescued her that the Princess is alive
and well on Earth, but I still wonder if she had anything to do with events.
Or worse still, what future events will come about because of her influence.&quot;
     &quot;One soldier to another, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled.  &quot;Which do you fear
to be the greater threat, the conflict between Rune and Nop&#39;tera or the Moon
Princess?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren sighed and rubbed her face gently.  &quot;In the short-term, Rune and
Nop&#39;tera,&quot; she said in a weary tone.  &quot;But I can&#39;t just focus on whatever is
in front of me at the moment, I have to look further down the line to what may
lie ahead in the immediate future.  And bear in mind that the concern over what
to ultimately do about her seems to be a very key aspect of the conflict Rune
and Nop&#39;tera are in,&quot; she pointed out.  &quot;I doubt we can solve one question or
otherwise alleviate it without addressing the other.&quot;
     &quot;I concur,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied.  &quot;I see this boiling down to two things,
then: Whether or not you and I can find a sort of middle ground that everyone
can live with, and whether or not we have enough influence over our superiors
to get them to see things as we do.  I have faith that Nop&#39;tera will listen to
me if I can provide her with a reasonable accord.  Talking to you in person and
seeing how you react has given me a measure of faith that you indeed are a very
reasonable individual as I suspected.  I will not waste my time fighting for a
cause if it is truly lost, but I will fight to the last if I have reason to
believe that victory is both achievable and ultimately worth the cost that must
be paid in order to obtain it.  The question is, Admiral, what do you think?
Do you believe that you and I can work together to end this and possibly even
save our world, or do you believe all is well and truly lost?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m not much of an optimist these
days, but I don&#39;t think the situation is that bad.  Yet,&quot; she added with a
dark sigh.  &quot;If I thought that we could simply sit at a table and work out an
accord between the two of us in the span of a few hours, one that would truly
end this mess, I would gladly skip dinner in order to see it done.  However, I
also have to remain realistic with my expectations.  You would be asking Rune
to put her deep-seated vengeance aside and let the one woman she hates above
all others become her Queen-Regent.  I simply don&#39;t see that happening, as I
don&#39;t see what kind of concession Nop&#39;tera could possibly make that would make
it worthwhile for Rune to do so.&quot;
     &quot;Then we should ask General Rune what she wants,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied in a
gentle tone.  &quot;As long as it does not involve either the death of the Moon
Princess or detriment to Nop&#39;tera&#39;s position, I believe Nop&#39;tera can be rather
flexible in terms of who is actually in charge of the military.&quot;
     &quot;Your general wants to be in charge of everything,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out.
&quot;Which by every legal right is Rune&#39;s job.  I understand that Nop&#39;tera has more
seniority than you, me, and Rune put together, but simply put Rune was named
Commander-General by Queen Beryl herself just days before her death.  A death
at the hands of the very same woman Nop&#39;tera wishes to make Queen-Regent,&quot; she
added with emphasis.  &quot;There are many, *many* denizens who wish to see Sailor
Moon executed for that one alone, and I for one don&#39;t see things going over too
well if she suddenly is put on the throne in Queen Beryl&#39;s place.&quot;
     &quot;Would that include yourself, Admiral?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired mildly.
     Si&#39;ren remained silent for a moment as she sought to both calm herself and
compose her thoughts.  &quot;I have never met the girl myself, or at least not while
she was conscious and able to react to her surroundings,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;As
such, I haven&#39;t been able to form an opinion of her as a person and only have
her reputation and history of actions to go by.  She could end up being a great
Queen-Regent, she could end up being an absolute disaster, I honestly have no
idea.  The thing to remember with this is that the choice really isn&#39;t ours to
make who becomes Queen-Regent, but rather Prince Darian&#39;s.  After all, he is
the Crown Prince, and it is the mother of his child who will be Queen-Regent
until the princess is old enough to assume the throne herself.&quot;
     &quot;Admiral?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a pained tone, casting a concerned glance at
Sirene as he could audibly hear her implants blinking hard.  &quot;Again, I ask your
forgiveness at seeming to be so blatantly ignorant of current affairs, but when
was a Crown Prince anointed, and why hasn&#39;t he intervened in this?&quot;
     &quot;Doesn&#39;t Nop&#39;tera tell you anything?&quot; Si&#39;ren growled in open frustration.
&quot;Prince Darian of Earth was named Crown Prince by the NegaForce quite some time
ago, but that only recently came to light.  Regardless of which, I know for a
fact that Nop&#39;tera knows as the NegaForce itself told her that when she went to
see it long before this nonsense between her and Rune got out of hand.&quot;
     &quot;Where is he now?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled as he stood up straight, flexing his
wings cautiously.  &quot;If he is indeed our Prince, then he can end this now with
but a few words to both Rune and Nop&#39;tera.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s not that simple,&quot; Si&#39;ren countered.  &quot;First and foremost, he may be
the Crown Prince but that does not give him any authority.  He is the Queen&#39;s
consort and little else, the laws are quite clear on that.  I assure you, Rune
will not listen to him if she doesn&#39;t like what he says.  And in any case, he
is with his Moon Princess and her Sailor Scouts on Earth, which the NegaForce
has forbidden us from entering for any reason.&quot;
     A quiet grunt rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; chest.  &quot;Rune may not be willing to
listen to a Crown Prince, but I assure you that Nop&#39;tera most certainly will.
Should he make a proclamation as to how the military will be structured, she
will follow it to the letter with conviction.  Even if it goes against her,&quot; he
added with a faint emphasis.
     &quot;I suppose that should be a comfort to know,&quot; Si&#39;ren said neutrally.  &quot;But
as I said, the NegaForce has deemed Earth to be off-limits for now, so I am not
about to knock on Darian&#39;s apartment door to ask for his input on a purely
internal matter.&quot;
     &quot;Odd,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a distinctly casual tone, &quot;I have received no such
instructions from either the NegaForce or my chain of command with regards to
Earth being off-limits.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked in surprise, both eyebrows arching clear up to her hairline
at the implication of his words.  &quot;I just told you about it,&quot; she pointed out.
     &quot;With all due respect, ma&#39;am,&quot; he replied in a tone that suggested he was
smiling inside his helmet, &quot;While you are the Fleet Admiral and a direct order
from you will be heeded as it would from any superior officer, you are not in
my chain of command.&quot;
     &quot;Tell me something, General,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a very wary tone.  &quot;You like
to play dangerous gambits in your spare time, don&#39;t you?&quot;
     A very soft laugh rose up from Ar&#39;kanis&#39; helmet as he flexed his wings.
&quot;As I said, Admiral, I will fight to the last if I have reason to believe that
the victory I seek is both achievable and ultimately worth the cost that will
need to be paid in order to obtain it.  I have already risked death once to
come here in order to find a viable solution to this crisis, I have very little
hesitation of doing so again if it will bring me closer to a resolution.  I
doubt that I will be able to visit Earth personally, given the fact that I am
quite unable to masquerade myself as a human, but I&#39;m sure I can find someone
suitable I can trust beyond reproach who can go in my stead.&quot;
     &quot;And that will accomplish what?&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out.  &quot;As I said, General
Rune won&#39;t listen to him.&quot;
     &quot;What of the rest of the military command structure?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis countered.
     &quot;What of them?&quot; the white-haired woman replied in a suddenly leery tone.
     Ar&#39;kanis made a gesture with his hand.  &quot;Say that we find Prince Darian
and have him speak to the global population, assuring them that the matter of
reconstituting the monarchy is well in-hand and that they will have their Queen
in a matter of a few decades.  Should he in his speech outline any suggestions
for reform within the military....&quot;
     &quot;Enough,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a very quiet tone.  &quot;Rune will not accept any of
it, then it will trigger the very same civil war that we are all trying to
prevent from happening.  If you are suggesting an uprising of sorts against
Rune&#39;s legal authority, then you are essentially advocating high treason.  I
will not stand for such talk, General, is that perfectly clear?&quot;
     &quot;Clear as crystal, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said as he came to attention, causing
Sirene to stiffen up a moment later out of pure reflex.
     Si&#39;ren looked at the both for a moment before sighing softly and rubbing
her sinuses yet again.  &quot;At ease, both of you,&quot; she murmured, causing them to
relax their rigid postures.  &quot;I understand what you are trying to accomplish,
General Ar&#39;kanis, and believe me when I say I fully support your objective of
putting an end to things, but it isn&#39;t that simple.  I&#39;ve had a magistrate go
over the laws with a quantum microscope, and there just isn&#39;t any way around
the fact that Rune was named Commander-General by royal fiat, and that makes
her Nop&#39;tera&#39;s superior.  The best that can be done is that Nop&#39;tera gets named
the Central Division commander and thus becomes Rune&#39;s executive officer until
Rune steps down or otherwise retires.  The naming of the position can only be
done by Royal Decree, and we need a Queen for that.  And no, a Crown Prince&#39;s
word will not be sufficient.  Believe me, I checked,&quot; she added wistfully.
     Both Ar&#39;kanis and Sirene blinked as the comm-link on Si&#39;ren&#39;s belt went
off, resulting in a truly dark and vicious curse from the Fleet Admiral.  She
plucked the device off her belt and flicked her thumb over the switch, opening
it with a faint growl.  &quot;Si&#39;ren.&quot;
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, your presence is requested in Operations,&quot; a voice said calmly.
     Si&#39;ren rolled her eyes and suppressed the urge to hurl the device down the
hallway.  &quot;I will be there in five minutes.  Out,&quot; she said as she closed the
channel and returned the comm-link to her belt.  &quot;I don&#39;t see how Rune puts up
with this,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised Medical hasn&#39;t asked me to change a
diaper yet or something equally as trivial.&quot;
     &quot;Admiral, if I may,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis spoke up in a cautious tone, &quot;Where is
General Rune at the moment?  I should like to speak with her directly before I
attempt to return to the V&#39;ral.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren visibly hesitated before sighing and running her fingers through
her close-cropped white hair.  &quot;General Rune is under house arrest pending the
results of Internal Review&#39;s inquiry into the missile launch,&quot; she said in a
neutral tone.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said, clearly surprised by the news.  &quot;Am I to presume that
you have taken her place as the military commander on a temporary basis, then?&quot;
     &quot;For the moment, General,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied in a wary tone.  &quot;But I wouldn&#39;t
get any ideas if I were you.  I may not be directly in your chain of command,
or Nop&#39;tera&#39;s for that matter, but I still outrank the both of you by a pretty
clear margin.  For now, I am in charge and things will be done my way until I
am properly relieved by the Commander-General.&quot;
     &quot;Understood perfectly, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with a nod of his head.
&quot;Then if I may....&quot;
     &quot;No,&quot; Si&#39;ren said calmly, cutting him off with a gesture.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am?&quot; the tank general said, clearly surprised by the interruption.
     &quot;I have things to do, General,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out.  &quot;If you wish to talk
further, it will have to wait until I have the time in which to do so.  I would
be more than willing to discuss other matters with you after dinner, or even
during it if you are that impatient, but I have a military to oversee and one
that is in a mild uproar at that.&quot;
     &quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied in a faintly uneasy tone.  &quot;If I may
ask one more question of you.... what would you have me do in the interim?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren paused as she realized that she had basically told him he had to
wait for a few hours and thus his concern was a valid one.  &quot;Well....&quot; she said
slowly, trying to think of what she might be able to get away with having him
do.  A sudden thought popped into her mind, causing her to mull it over for a
few moments.  &quot;Seeing how it might be in your best interests to keep as low a
profile as you can.... why don&#39;t you see what Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet can do for
you?  I&#39;m sure Hospitality can take your mind off matters until dinner.  And
that would include you as well, Major,&quot; she added as she glanced at Sirene.
&quot;I realize that not very many denizens choose to use cybernetic implants, but
I know for a fact that Hospitality is still equipped to handle someone who has
them.  Even if the implants are not perfectly waterproof,&quot; she added.
     Sirene blinked and cast an uneasy glance at Ar&#39;kanis, drawing a casual
shrug in response.  &quot;If that is your recommendation, Admiral, then we shall go
see what your Hospitality division can do for us.  We of course have no such
units with us, but Nop&#39;tera has spoken of them somewhat fondly at times,&quot; he
added in a faintly bemused tone.
     A faint smile touched the edges of Si&#39;ren&#39;s lips.  &quot;Yes, they have a way
of taking your mind off things.  If there are any concerns, have Zan&#39;zemet call
me personally and I will see that she understands what is being asked of her.&quot;
     &quot;By your command, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said with a sharp salute.
     &lt;Ma&#39;am,&gt; Sirene added with a salute of her own.
     Si&#39;ren gave them a somber look before returning the salute and turning to
leave, pausing after only a few steps.  &quot;If you do happen to send someone to
Earth to speak with Darian, make sure you do so politely and carefully,&quot; she
said in a very quiet voice that was almost too soft to hear.  &quot;I doubt that the
Sailor Scouts will attack your envoy without just cause, but I would still walk
with a light tread nonetheless.  They are quite the force to be reckoned with,&quot;
she murmured as she resumed walking down the hall.
     &lt;Sir?&gt; Sirene spoke up after the admiral had disappeared from both normal
view and the range of her thermographic optics.
     &quot;At ease, Major, neither you nor I will be going to Earth,&quot; he rumbled
softly, absently stretching his wings.
     &lt;So who gets the lucky assignment?&gt; Sirene muttered.
     A soft snort echoed within the confines of his helmet.  &quot;One thing at a
time, Major.  For now, I think it best that we do as she suggested and pay a
low-key visit to Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s domain.  I will admit some measure of
curiosity as to how.... refreshing such a place can be, but I doubt that they
will be able to assist one such as I.  If I may, Major.... just how waterproof
are your implants?&quot;
     A muted burst of static could be heard from her vocoder as she made a soft
grumbling noise to herself.  &lt;Let&#39;s just say that taking a shower is a minor
adventure in of itself,&gt; she replied in an unusually flat tone.  &lt;Now if they
have a bath to soak in, I&#39;ll be perfectly fine as long as the waterline stays
below my collarbone.&gt;
     Ar&#39;kanis nodded absently to himself.  &quot;I&#39;m sure you will not encounter any
difficulty in finding a suitable pool of water to soak in,&quot; he said as he cast
appraising glances at both ends of the hallway, trying to gain his bearings.
&quot;Well then, seeing how we have little else to do for the moment, shall we go
present ourselves to the good Brigadier?&quot;
     Sirene cast a discreet sidelong glance at the armored figure before she
shook her head gently.  &lt;Right behind you, sir,&gt; she said in a neutral tone as
she began to follow him down the corridor, wondering what she was going to be
subjected to during the course of the adventure and trying to ignore the very
uneasy feeling that it wouldn&#39;t be over anytime soon.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Artemis, are you SURE about this?&quot; Mina said for the fifth time as she
kept a very critical eye on the way the white cat was laboring for breath.
     &quot;Like I said, just give me a few moments,&quot; Artemis panted quietly as he
remained half-curled up in a ball on the table, all but obscured by the way
Serena&#39;s denizen wings were brushing back and forth over his fur.  The gold
crescent mark on his head seemed to twinkle slightly, making it seem to be a
trick of the light.  Next to him were a pair of brand-new communicator units,
created from the Lunar energy that he had apparently been able to draw from
Serena when in protracted contact with her angelic wings.
     &quot;We can wait for Luna, you know,&quot; Mina persisted.
     &quot;Easy, blondie,&quot; Leda said gently as she reached out to lightly stroke
Artemis&#39; tail.  &quot;I&#39;m sure he knows what he&#39;s doing.  And there really isn&#39;t any
rush for this, you know,&quot; she added, more to the cat than to Mina.  &quot;Making the
units is one thing, but Ami has to reprogram them first and all.  Um, speaking
of which....&quot; she added as she glanced over her shoulder to the far end of the
table where Ami was seated.
     &quot;I&#39;m working on it,&quot; Ami said as she finished prying the cover off of her
own communicator unit.  Her miniature computer was likewise half-disassembled
and scattered in a neat arc in front of her, accompanied by a small collection
of tiny micro-screwdrivers and connection wires.  &quot;Allocating a trio of unique
frequencies will only take a second, but we first need to upgrade the software
in the existing communicators to take the new changes into account.  I&#39;m going
to see if I can&#39;t cross-link the new pattern through the datalink Maze and I
created to the cathedral&#39;s computer core, but that software has to be upgraded
first and that has to be done by hand unless I can push the changes through my
computer, but first I need to test that with my communicator so I know I&#39;m not
going to blow a hole through the memory matrix or melt something again....&quot;
     Alex and Michelle traded uneasy looks before the blonde leaned over to tap
Leda&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;Is she alright?&quot; she asked in a low tone, making a gesture
towards Ami.
     &quot;Trust me, she&#39;s fine,&quot; Leda replied with a smirk.  &quot;Not that I understood
half of what she just said, mind you, but she knows what she&#39;s doing.  Kinda
like the furball here does, or so he claims....&quot;
     &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Artemis muttered as he gingerly rose to his feet.  The
gentle motion of Serena&#39;s wings didn&#39;t stop for a moment, smoothly gliding back
and forth over his fur in slow and steady strokes.  He closed his eyes for a
moment and concentrated, causing the crescent mark on his forehead to begin
glowing in a somewhat unsteady fashion.
     &quot;That looks awful faint,&quot; Mina pointed out after a few moments when she
didn&#39;t notice any strengthening of the glow.
     &quot;Shush,&quot; the white cat murmured as he continued to concentrate.  &quot;This
sort of thing usually takes me a few weeks to fully recharge, and that&#39;s only
if it&#39;s not cloudy during the phases of the full moon.  I think I&#39;m doing quite
well as it is, so settle down.&quot;
     &quot;Still....&quot; Mina protested with a small pout, glancing up as Whisper came
over to sit down at the table, a small steaming cup of ma&#39;cha in one hand.
     &quot;So what exactly are you doing, Artemis?&quot; the telepath inquired as she
took a careful sip of her ma&#39;cha, keeping one eye on the white cat.  &quot;I&#39;m still
detecting a definite psionic resonance of sorts, but it&#39;s nothing I&#39;ve ever
encountered before.&quot;
     Artemis sighed very quietly, seeming to try to relax even has he continued
to maintain a high level of concentration.  &quot;It&#39;s a little difficult to explain
to others since I don&#39;t fully understand it myself.  Lunar cats like myself and
Luna are.... I won&#39;t say linked to the Moon Kingdom, but I understand that we
were bred to exist there.  We have human-equivalent intelligence as well as the
ability to talk in human languages, but we also seem to have mental capacities
that humans lack.  I&#39;m not sure if it qualifies as psionics, but we can exert
a sort of hypnotic influence if we work at it.&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Mina laughed very softly to herself.  &quot;So that would explain why my
parents didn&#39;t mind adopting an apparently stray cat from England, eh?&quot;
     &quot;Exactly,&quot; Artemis murmured, the glow from the crescent moon mark on his
forehead becoming brighter with each passing moment.  &quot;Here on Earth we can
gather a form of energy called Lunar energy, the source of which appears to be
rays of sunlight that are reflected off of the moon during the night.  Whether
it&#39;s the actual moonlight or something that is emanating from the Moon Kingdom
itself, we don&#39;t know.  We just know we can gather the most Lunar energy on
cloudless nights when the moon is full.
     &quot;As for what we can do with it.... again, that&#39;s a bit difficult to try to
explain,&quot; Artemis continued with a soft sigh.  &quot;We can either transfer the
energy directly to someone with an elemental spirit that can use it, giving
them a sort of energy boost that can be reworked into something constructive,
or we can.... condense it, if you will, into something that has direct ties to
an elemental entity that is in turn tied to the Moon Kingdom.  That&#39;s how I was
able to save Mina&#39;s life back then, by infusing what little Lunar energy I had
left into those glasses.  It wasn&#39;t enough to awaken the reincarnated soul of
Sailor Venus, but it provided enough oomph to at least partially empower the
elemental core inside her spirit to trigger a defensive response.&quot;
     &quot;Okay,&quot; Leda said slowly, pausing as she realized that Ami was intently
focused on something her computer was doing and didn&#39;t appear to be aware of
what was being discussed.  &quot;So that might explain Sailor V to a certain degree
and all, but I still don&#39;t see how that lets you yank deactivated communicators
out of your butt or anything.  Or is that just a variation of that condensation
category you mentioned?&quot;
     &quot;Something like that,&quot; Artemis admitted with the feline equivalent of a
shrug.  &quot;Like I said, I don&#39;t truly understand how it works, I just know that
I can turn a certain level of Lunar energy into an unassigned communicator that
Ami can reprogram into a functional device.  I think I&#39;m almost there,&quot; he
added as he started to stretch.
     Whisper nodded as she took another sip of ma&#39;cha.  &quot;So I take it that you
can now draw some of that energy from Serena?&quot; she ventured.
     &quot;Apparently so,&quot; the cat confirmed as he glanced up at Serena.  He got a
warm smile in response as several of her wings briefly squeezed him gently.
&quot;Granted it&#39;s not like I can just grab her wing for a few moments and I&#39;m good
to go, but it&#39;s like a steady trickle of Lunar energy.  And it only seems to be
coming from her wings,&quot; he added.  &quot;Otherwise, Luna would&#39;ve long ago become
super-charged every other day from the constant attention she gets.&quot;
     &quot;Is that a bad thing?&quot; Alex spoke up as she absently toyed with a lock of
Michelle&#39;s aquamarine hair.
     &quot;Well, there is such a thing as too much energy,&quot; Artemis admitted.  &quot;Not
that Luna or I have really ever had a chance to collect that much with as often
as we&#39;ve had to replace things around here....&quot;
     &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Mina spoke up with a slight huff.
     &quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t mention names, did I?&quot; Artemis countered with a flick of
his tail.  &quot;Stop and think all of what we&#39;ve done since we came out of stasis.
We had to create four Power Wands, Ami&#39;s computer, six communicators, we pretty
much emptied the tanks super-charging you when you went into the Negaverse with
Tolaris, we had to create four new communicators for the denizens after you
came back, and that doesn&#39;t even begin to cover all the part replacements we&#39;ve
had to do.  We can&#39;t just make individual pieces to replace what&#39;s broken, we
have to make entirely new devices.  Like when Ami royally zorched the chips on
her computer&#39;s motherboard....&quot;
     &quot;Daughterboard,&quot; Ami corrected calmly, causing the rest of the group to
jump slightly.
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; Artemis sighed.  &quot;Between Luna and myself, we&#39;ve made no less
than four copies of her computer for parts and salvage, and I don&#39;t even want
to speculate how many times we had to replace someone&#39;s communicator because it
was dropped and stepped on, or flooded in the bathtub, or ruined by some other
surprisingly catastrophic event.  I *still* don&#39;t know how Rei managed to melt
hers that one day, as they are quite heat-resistant....&quot;
     &quot;Wait,&quot; Leda said in a suddenly quiet voice.  &quot;I thought these things were
waterproof?  I know I dropped mine into the sink once or twice and it came back
out okay.  It needed a good cleaning after that, but it still worked fine.&quot;
     &quot;They weren&#39;t waterproof originally,&quot; Artemis said in a flat tone.
     &quot;Oh, that&#39;s right,&quot; Ami said as she lifted her head up from her computer
chassis, her expression slightly vacant.  &quot;I thought there was something else
I had to do before I was finished.  The last time I upgraded the chips in the
communicators, I made sure to coat them with a waterproof sealant I developed
in the school&#39;s chemistry lab after class one day.  Umm....&quot; she hesitated as
she cast a quick glance over her shoulder towards the stairwell.  &quot;There might
be some left, but I&#39;m wondering if Dyvach ate it for analysis....&quot;
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Serena sighed, her triple-tone voice sounding unusually resigned.
&quot;Mina&#39;s right.  You need to get out more.&quot;
     &quot;Serena, don&#39;t give me that,&quot; Ami protested.  &quot;The reason I even came up
with the sealant in the first place is because you ruined two others in the
span of a week, both of which caused by liquids seeping into the casing to
short out the power conduits.&quot;
     Leda just sighed and shook her head gently.  &quot;C&#39;mon, guys, just because
Rei isn&#39;t here to argue with Serena doesn&#39;t mean someone needs to step up and
take her place.  If Ami has enough know-how in her skull to walk into a chem
lab and walk back out with something useful, more power to her.  Hell, I wish
I knew how to do that, but then I&#39;d be tempted to come back out with a better
beer or something.&quot;
     &quot;Nothing wrong with that, babe,&quot; Alex spoke up, drawing a faint look of
unamusement from Michelle.  &quot;You know, speaking of which, I don&#39;t suppose you
know how to brew your own yet?  I&#39;d try to figure it out myself, but then Mich
wouldn&#39;t let me hear the end of it and god forbid if I should actually give it
a shot.... oh, don&#39;t start, love,&quot; she sighed heavily as she heard a muted but
distinctly flat growl coming from Michelle.
     &quot;You don&#39;t need to be getting drunk,&quot; Michelle said tersely.
     &quot;Who said anything about getting drunk?&quot; Alex countered.  &quot;If we were
talking about the heavy stuff, you&#39;re right, it&#39;d be the counting game again.
But this is beer here, babe, it&#39;s supposed to be enjoyed for the taste rather
than the alcohol content.&quot;
     &quot;Counting game?&quot; Mina echoed, giving Leda a slightly wary look.
     The brunette shrugged.  &quot;One tequila, two tequila, three tequila, floor,&quot;
she said simply.  &quot;At least, that&#39;s how it is with me and alcohol shots in
rapid succession.  And no, Alex, I don&#39;t brew my own beer.  That&#39;s a little on
the time-intensive side and all, and the taste isn&#39;t worth the effort.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; the Viking said with a wave of her hand.  &quot;It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve got
much to do around here as it is.  I take it you&#39;re all set, Artemis?&quot; she said
as she noticed him easing himself out of Serena&#39;s winged embrace.
     &quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; he sighed quietly.  &quot;But quick recharges from Serena
or not, this&#39;ll be the last one for a day or two.  Granted this mostly uses
Lunar energy, but I&#39;m the one who has to channel it and that&#39;s not something
you can do all day.  It&#39;s probably no worse than you guys using your Sailor
Scout powers,&quot; he suggested.
     Alex blinked and looked down at her hand, absently making a fist.  &quot;Yeah,
I see what you mean,&quot; she said before she looked back up at him.
     &quot;Artemis, are you sure about this?&quot; Mina spoke up, giving him a concerned
look.  &quot;Like we&#39;ve said from the start, there isn&#39;t any rush for this.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, good, that worked,&quot; Ami spoke up, staring down at the readings on her
communicator display.  She glanced up as she realized that the rest of the room
was looking at her curiously, causing a faint blush to rise to her cheeks.  &quot;I
just had to be certain that I wouldn&#39;t ruin anything if I pushed the software
and firmware changes to the cathedral&#39;s communicator node, and from there have
it push the changes to everyone&#39;s communicators.  Including the blanks,&quot; she
added as she gestured to the pair of devices near Artemis&#39; paw.  &quot;I&#39;ll still
need to manually key in the transponder and frequency codes, but they&#39;ve been
set aside and just need to be loaded into permanent memory.  What?&quot; she added
in a faintly uneasy tone at the looks on their faces.
     Alex just shrugged.  &quot;Hey, at long as you understand it, babe.  Let me
know when you&#39;re finished with it so you can show me how it works and all.&quot;
     &quot;Good luck,&quot; Artemis murmured as he crouched low and closed his eyes.  He
began to concentrate a moment later, causing the glow of the crescent moon on
his forehead to nearly triple in intensity.  He seemed to tense up slightly as
he drew in a deep breath, then suddenly exploded into a back-flip that launched
him a surprising distance above the table.
     The glow from the mark on his forehead seemed to carve a path through the
air, leaving a visible trail in its wake.  As the cat tumbled in a loop, the
glowing line folded in on itself and started to balloon out, quickly taking on
a flat rectangular shape.  The shape solidified a moment later into the shape
of a communicator unit, falling towards the ground even as Artemis came back
down to land on his feet.  There was a surprisingly soft thump as he landed,
followed by the much louder clatter of the communicator landing next to the
other two copies.
     &quot;Nice,&quot; Leda commented.  &quot;Hey, you okay?&quot; she blurted out as the white cat
started to sway on his feet.
     &quot;Okay, we&#39;re done here,&quot; Artemis murmured as he plopped over on his side,
his breath heaving in his chest again.  He was immediately engulfed by Serena&#39;s
wings, wrapping around him so that only his head and his tail were poking out
of the glowing bundle.  &quot;Yeah, so popping out that last one might not have been
such a hot idea after all, but it&#39;s done.  Tag, Ami, you&#39;re it,&quot; he wheezed.
     &quot;Thirty seconds,&quot; Ami said as she pressed a button on her computer.  A
very quiet and steady beeping sound could be heard from the device a moment
later, letting her know that it was transmitting the data as instructed.  The
sound seemed to pause for a number of seconds before it began to make a series
of loud beeps at a much slower pace.  &quot;Push successful, bursting data now,&quot; she
reported with a satisfied smile.
     &quot;In King&#39;s English, hon?&quot; Alex prodded.  She blinked along with the rest
of the room at the sound of the loud chittering noise in the room, followed by
the sound of the cathedral&#39;s computer &#39;thinking aloud&#39; as a series of muted
beeps and buzzes heard over the ceiling speakers.  &quot;Wait, what the hell is
that?&quot; she demanded.
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Ami said quietly as she glanced down at her computer.  &quot;I forgot
to instruct it to process silently.  Odd, it usually doesn&#39;t do that....&quot;  She
blinked as she heard a flat beeping noise that usually indicated a refusal or
negative response on the computer&#39;s part.  &quot;That didn&#39;t sound good.  I wonder
what it....?  Oh, I see,&quot; she said, nodding absently at the display on her
miniature computer.  She paused and glanced up at the rest of the group as she
noticed they were giving her odd looks again.  &quot;Check your communicators,&quot; she
suggested.  &quot;You&#39;ll see what I mean.&quot;
     &quot;Okay,&quot; Alex said as she moved to peer over Leda&#39;s shoulder, trying to
read the lines of text scrolling up on the tiny display.

     &quot;Wow,&quot; Leda said as her eyebrows arched up.  &quot;That&#39;s a lot of frequencies
to keep track of.  I see that the three new ones are here.... sorta....&quot;
     Ami nodded as she carefully disconnected the wires that had connected her
computer to the transmission node of her communicator.  &quot;The frequencies are
already assigned and allocated, but they&#39;re not ready to be used yet.  That&#39;s
why you&#39;ve got the no-carrier warning.  What triggered the error messages from
the cathedral&#39;s computer was the fact that it can&#39;t find the transponders from
the communicators Tolaris, Maze, and Ra&#39;vel have with them.  They&#39;ll get the
update the next time they come within transmission range of the node we built
for the cathedral&#39;s computer.  Pass me one of those, please?&quot; she added as she
gestured to the pile of inert communicators on the table.
     &quot;Sure,&quot; Leda said as she reached out and carefully sent them skidding over
to where the blue-haired girl was at.
     &quot;C&#39;mere, you,&quot; Mina sighed as she reached out to gently scoop up Artemis,
cradling him in her arms and lightly scratching his ears.  &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re
going to be okay?&quot; she asked in a concerned tone.
     &quot;Yeah, really,&quot; Artemis replied with a loud yawn.  &quot;I&#39;ll probably go take
a nap in a bit, but I&#39;m fine.  Just don&#39;t ask me to pop another one of those
things out for another few days,&quot; he added with a faintly raspy chuckle.
     Everyone looked up as a dull flash lit the room, only half-surprised to
see Susan time-shifting into the room.  She was still wearing the dark green
business suit and had a distinctly satisfied look on her face.  &quot;Good evening,&quot;
she said with an audible measure of warmth to her voice.
     &quot;Hey, Sue,&quot; Alex replied casually.  &quot;So how&#39;d it all go?&quot;
     &quot;Rather well, to be honest,&quot; Susan said as she leaned her staff against
the back of the armchair.  She then paused to indulge in a brief stretch,
interlocking her fingers together and raising them over her head for several
moments.  &quot;The wire transfer from England was successful, as was the seeding
of both your paperwork and Michelle&#39;s.  The financial paperwork seems to have
been delayed, most likely because of the need to validate the wire transfer,
but I fully expect that to be resolved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.&quot;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; Alex replied as she glanced over at Ami.
     Susan paused for a moment as she noticed what Serena was wearing.  &quot;If I
may, your Highness, I take it that you had to borrow that for the time being?&quot;
she inquired, making a slight gesture to the ribbon-like attire.
     &quot;My idea, not hers,&quot; Alex spoke up before Serena could reply.  &quot;I figured
you wouldn&#39;t mind since she doesn&#39;t have much in the way of open-backed gowns
or the like.&quot;
     Susan smiled gently.  &quot;Of course I don&#39;t mind,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Had I known
that you needed something along those lines, your Highness, I would have made
sure to pick something up before I returned here.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Serena said quietly as she flicked her wings behind her.
     &quot;Want to hit the mall tomorrow, Serena?&quot; Mina offered as she moved over to
the couch and sat down, still gently cradling Artemis in her arms.  &quot;I mean, I
know Tuesdays aren&#39;t the hottest shopping days, but I think we can find you a
bargain or three to wear around the house, as it were.&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Serena replied, blinking and casting a glance over her bare
shoulder as she heard a fairly hard beeping sound.
     &quot;I think that did it,&quot; Ami said, more to herself than to anyone else.  She
typed in a quick command to her computer and waited for the results, a smile of
satisfaction crossing her face as she got the answer she expected.  &quot;Yes, that
did it alright,&quot; she purred as she lifted her head up.  She paused and blinked
hard as she realized that Susan had joined them.  &quot;Oh, hello, Susan.  How did
everything go?&quot;
     Susan paused for a moment to regard her carefully, one delicate green
eyebrow arching up slightly.  &quot;As well as can be expected.  Should I inquire as
to what you have done to your computer, or is the matter sufficiently under
control?&quot;
     &quot;Hmm?  Oh, I&#39;m just using it to reprogram the transponder codes and upload
the frequency and memory matrices for the new communicators,&quot; she explained as
she held up the newly-imprinted device.  &quot;Just let me run a quick diagnostic on
this and it should be ready for use.&quot;
     Susan blinked in reply, both eyebrows arching upwards in a gesture of
surprise.  She then glanced over at Artemis, blinking again as she realized
that the white cat seemed to be more than a little exhausted.  &quot;Artemis, did
you fabricate those, by chance?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     &quot;Do you see a giant crystal spider around here?&quot; Artemis replied with a
quiet chuckle.  &quot;Yes, I used Lunar energy to make them.  And before you ask, I
drew the power from Serena.  It seems her wings are more than a little charged
with Lunar energy.&quot;
     &quot;Ah,&quot; the succubus replied, turning to give Serena an appraising look.
&quot;That would explain several minor curiosities, then, the least of which being
the energy I can sense when in physical contact with you.  Artemis, please tell
me that you did not over-exert yourself when you crafted those devices,&quot; she
added as she glanced back over at the white cat.
     &quot;Told you,&quot; Mina muttered quietly.
     &quot;You hush,&quot; Artemis countered with a flick of his tail.
     &quot;Artemis,&quot; Susan said in a reproving tone.
     &quot;Oh, don&#39;t you start,&quot; the cat sighed.  &quot;I didn&#39;t break anything, and you
know it takes a minor toll on us to even use that kind of power.  I didn&#39;t push
myself over the edge or anything like that.&quot;
     Susan nodded in understanding.  &quot;I should hope not,&quot; she replied in a far
more gentle tone.  &quot;In any case, your efforts are sincerely appreciated, I
assure you.&quot;
     &quot;Okay, it&#39;s good,&quot; Ami said cheerfully as she held up the communicator.
&quot;I&#39;m just going down the list here, so this first one is for Alex.&quot;
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Alex said as she moved over to accept the device.  &quot;So how exactly
do I use this thing?  Wait, hang on a sec.... Mich, you want to come see this?
That way she doesn&#39;t have to explain twice.&quot;
     &quot;Here, let me show you guys,&quot; Leda said as she moved over to stand next
to Alex, making sure to leave room for Michelle.  &quot;That way Ami can go back to
doing whatever.  Okay, it&#39;s simple, see these buttons?  You push them to send
a signal to whomever you want to talk to, and you can tell who&#39;s using what
channel by these icons here.&quot;
     &quot;Huh, those are the signs of our Houses,&quot; Alex pointed out.
     &quot;Exactly, which keeps things real simple here,&quot; the brunette said with a
nod as she pulled out her own communicator.  &quot;Just for kicks, push the Jupiter
button and it&#39;ll try to open a channel....  See?&quot; she added as her communicator
started to chirp for attention.  &quot;Now, this button will cancel a request if it
isn&#39;t answered, or will close the session if you have one open.  This big one
here with the bumps on it is the panic button, you don&#39;t want to press that
unless it&#39;s an emergency since it will set everyone&#39;s alarm off.  Seriously,
don&#39;t fool with it unless you&#39;ve got a problem on your hands.  As for that row
on the top, that&#39;s all related to diagnostics and networking stuff, you&#39;ll have
to sit down with Ami and have her explain it to you since it&#39;s all technical.&quot;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; Alex said as she studied the row of icons.  &quot;So what are these
sigils here?  This one, these two, that red one, and these four here.&quot;
     Leda glanced down at her own communicator, one eyebrow arching up as she
saw a new channel that she hadn&#39;t noticed before.  &quot;Huh.  Well, this one is
Darian&#39;s, I think that blue one on the left is the link to Ami&#39;s computer, the
red cross is the Emergency channel, the panic button I told you about, and that
group of four are the channels used by Tolaris and crew.  The lightning bolt is
Tolaris, the star is Maze, that funky squiggle sign is Ra&#39;vel&#39;s, and that last
one is Whisper&#39;s.  Hey, Ami?  What&#39;s this spiky-looking Senshi line for?&quot;
     &quot;Funky squiggle sign?&quot; Ami echoed, giving her an incredulous look.
     Leda sighed quietly.  &quot;Like she would have understood what I meant if I
said the Dragoon insignia,&quot; she replied tartly.  &quot;So what&#39;s this one, anyway?&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s the bridging node for the cathedral&#39;s central computer,&quot; Ami said
as she glanced down, keeping an eye on what her own miniature computer was
doing to the fabricated communicator unit.  &quot;I don&#39;t have full access to it by
remote yet, but I can contact it and query most of the databases without having
to be at the main console in there,&quot; she said, making a gesture to the computer
room down the residential hallway.  &quot;Michelle, I&#39;m almost finished with yours,&quot;
she added as she glanced back down at the communicator she was working on.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Michelle said with a soft smile.
     &quot;Hey, speaking loosely of communications,&quot; Leda said as she headed over to
her stack of textbooks on the table.  &quot;Susan, do you have a few minutes?  We
have a list of things we&#39;d like to discuss with you now that you&#39;re here.  Hmm,
I think we can take the communicator issue off the list now,&quot; she said absently
as she picked up a pen and made a scratching motion.
     Susan nodded.  &quot;Providing you allow me a few moments to change and use the
bathroom first,&quot; she said lightly.  &quot;Business suits have their uses, but I find
them to be slightly confining by the end of the day.  I shall return in a few
moments,&quot; she said with a slight bow of her head as she quietly left the room.
     &quot;Hey, that&#39;s cool,&quot; Leda replied with a casual shrug.
     &quot;Okay, the diagnostic says it&#39;s ready,&quot; Ami said as she picked up the
communicator and handed it to Michelle.  &quot;Feel free to test it out, but as Leda
said, please don&#39;t use the Emergency button unless it really is an emergency.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Michelle replied as she accepted the device.  She looked at
the row of icons carefully before tapping the yellow sign of Uranus, blinking
as Alex&#39;s communicator immediately began to make a chirping sound.
     &quot;What?  Oh,&quot; Alex said as she glanced down at her own communicator.  She
flicked her thumb over the flashing button and blinked as Michelle&#39;s image
appeared in the tiny display window.  &quot;Wow,&quot; both Alex and Michelle said in
perfect unison, staring at their respective communicators.
     Both Ami and Serena had to repress the urge to giggle, while Leda leaned
back in her chair with a languid smile on her face.  &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s pretty much
what we said the first time Ami handed us those things,&quot; the brunette drawled.
&quot;Don&#39;t let them get too close to one another like that, though, or you&#39;ll start
to get feedback.&quot;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; Alex commented, blinking hard as she heard her own voice coming
from the tiny speaker in Michelle&#39;s communicator.  She glanced down at her own
unit and carefully pushed the close button, her eyebrows arching up as the tiny
image of Michelle&#39;s amazed face promptly winked out.
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Michelle protested.  She gave her communicator a hurt look before
she glanced over at Alex&#39;s communicator and realized why it had shut off like
that.  &quot;Oh, was that you?  Okay, I see how it works now.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, it&#39;s a little wild, ain&#39;t it?&quot; Alex agreed, absently reaching out
to wrap an arm around Michelle&#39;s waist.  &quot;So, Ami, what other kinds of toys do
you have around here for us to play with?&quot;
     &quot;Plug-in or battery operated?&quot; Mina muttered very softly to Artemis, her
soft smile turning distinctly wicked as the cat almost fell out of her lap.
     &quot;That was wrong,&quot; Artemis replied, giving her a slightly unamused look.
     &quot;Well, Michelle&#39;s the one with the tazer, so....&quot;
     &quot;Only because you gave it to her,&quot; he reminded her.
     Mina shrugged helplessly.  &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not like I was using it.&quot;
     A smirk crossed Artemis&#39; face as he stretched.  &quot;Well, you might want to
ask for it back since Maze won&#39;t be around for a few days....&quot;
     &quot;HEY!&quot; the blonde protested, giving him an upset look.  She paused as she
noticed that the rest of the group was looking at her, a knowing smirk visible
on Leda&#39;s face while Serena&#39;s expression was distinctly crimson.  Michelle and
Alex were giving her odd looks, being too far away to have heard every word in
the exchange, while Ami had returned to her task of reprogramming the remaining
communicator unit.  Whisper, for her part, seemed to be preoccupied in drinking
her ma&#39;cha and gave no indication of showing a reaction to what was said.
     &quot;Face it, girl,&quot; Leda spoke up as Mina began to quietly fume to herself.
&quot;You started it.  Besides, you can&#39;t win them all, so just let it go.&quot;
     &quot;Baaaah,&quot; Mina grumbled, glancing up as Susan returned to the room.  She
blinked and sat up straight as she saw the dark green summer dress that Susan
had changed into, a somewhat form-fitting design that looked to be more than a
little expensive.  &quot;Oh, wow, that&#39;s pretty.  Where did you get that?&quot;
     Susan paused in mid-motion and tilted her head slightly to one side, her
gaze becoming vacant for a brief moment as she sifted through her memories.
&quot;I believe the original was created by Minister Svetlana not too long ago, and
she was kind enough to let me copy the design template for my own use.  I had
to make a few adjustments, of course, as we wear different sizes and I desired
it to be an open-backed design, but the fabric was purchased during the early
twentieth century and reworked for me by Queen Serenity&#39;s seamstress.&quot;
     &quot;You didn&#39;t make it yourself?&quot; Michelle inquired, her eyebrows arching up.
     Susan made an idle gesture of dismissal as she made her way over to the
armchair and eased herself into it.  &quot;Granted I usually prefer to handle such
tasks myself, as I have ample time to do so during the twilight hours while
most others are asleep, but there were instances in which it was best to have
left the task to others.  In this particular case, I believe that Lady Arawn
expressed an interest in the design as well and wanted to see how difficult it
would be in certain places to sew together.  As we both benefitted from it, she
obtaining the experience she desired and I a new dress, I saw no reason to
reject her offer.&quot;
     Leda just shook her head to herself.  &quot;Susan, if you don&#39;t mind my asking
this, is there anything you *didn&#39;t* do while in the Moon Kingdom?  I mean, it
seems like you did everything.  Run the kingdom, cook, clean, sew, teach....&quot;
     &quot;Keep the guards happy,&quot; Alex muttered quietly, drawing a subtle poke in
the shoulder from Michelle.
     A soft smile crossed Susan&#39;s face as she leaned back against the cushions.
&quot;I will admit that I tended to let the cleaning and maintenance crews handle
most assignments, though that is not to say I haven&#39;t taken matters into my own
hands at times.  Simply put, Leda, I felt that I couldn&#39;t instruct someone to
perform a given task unless I had at least a rudimentary understanding of it
myself and thus would have a fair idea of what I was truly asking of them.  So
yes, I made it a point to personally take care of as many &#39;mundane&#39; chores and
tasks as I could at least twice so that I could get a proper feel for them.  I
will readily admit my skills in some areas are sub-par at best, or at least in
comparison to a dedicated professional, but I found that in the majority of the
instances I could achieve at least an acceptable result with a proper amount of
dedicated time and effort.
     &quot;You also have to keep in mind that I have two distinct advantages over
most humans,&quot; she added.  &quot;First, I have far more physical strength, stamina,
and a vastly reduced need for sleep compared to others, so I am able to work on
a given task for a greater stretch of time when others become tired or need to
sleep.  Second, I am over seven hundred years old, which means I have had more
than enough time in which to have picked up a considerable amount of skill and
knowledge about a truly diverse number of crafts and professions.  Perhaps it
can be best summarized as Mina might,&quot; she said, immediately drawing a wary
look from the blonde.  &quot;A Chancellor of all trades, but mistress of none.&quot;
     Mina blinked in surprise and looked down at Artemis.  &quot;Yeah, I can see
myself putting it like that,&quot; she admitted with a shrug.
     &quot;Age alone doesn&#39;t go nearly as far as you might like to imagine,&quot; Whisper
spoke up from her seat at the table.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure about your exact age, but
I&#39;m willing to bet I&#39;ve got a full century over you and even with that much I
probably couldn&#39;t do half of the things you seem to be able to do.  Don&#39;t get
me wrong, I can cook and clean as much as the next life-mate, and I can even
fix simple things like holes in socks, but I certainly don&#39;t know enough about
sewing to make my own dress from scratch.&quot;
     &quot;Whisper?&quot; Ami spoke up in a slightly odd tone, causing everyone to look
over at her.  A faint blush was coloring her cheeks as she gave the telepath a
somewhat apologetic look.  &quot;Part of that might be the denizen learning-curve
issue,&quot; she said, her blush darkening as Whisper raised an eyebrow.  &quot;At least
when compared to the rate at which humans learn.&quot;
     &quot;Meaning?&quot; Whisper prompted in a neutral tone.
     &quot;Meaning it takes a little longer for the denizen mind to imprint new
synapses in the brain, which translates into needing a little longer for it to
&#39;make sense&#39; or otherwise sink in.  I&#39;m not suggesting that denizens aren&#39;t
fast learners,&quot; she added hastily.  &quot;It&#39;s only when you compare the average
learning curves of a denizen to human normals and compress the time-span down
to equivalent levels that things appear.... different.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose I should be insulted,&quot; Whisper said in a bemused tone, giving
Ami a look that clearly indicated she wasn&#39;t upset in the least.  &quot;Granted we
do take a decade or two to get past the diaper stage in life, but still.... you
do have a bit of a point about how it takes a little practice for something to
go click in the mind.&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Leda chuckled quietly, glancing over at Serena to find a faintly
puzzled look on her face.  &quot;Be glad your human side kicked in long before your
denizen side did, Serena, otherwise you&#39;d really be having issues in school.&quot;
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Serena protested, giving the brunette an upset look.  She paused
and cast a glance over her shoulder to look at her wings, shimmying them gently
for a few moments before looking back at Leda.  &quot;Leave me alone,&quot; she muttered
as her wings started to slowly droop towards the ground.
     There was a somewhat awkward silence as Leda glanced at the rest of the
group before she looked down at the homework arrayed in front of her.  &quot;Oh, um,
seeing how we&#39;re on the subject of Serena&#39;s angelic side and all..... Susan, we
have a question for you.  How sensitive are you to spiritual energies?&quot;
     &quot;Fairly sensitive, although there are some that are far easier to detect
than others,&quot; the succubus replied carefully as she sat up.  &quot;I presume that a
a new concern regarding Serena&#39;s nature has arisen?&quot;
     &quot;Kinda,&quot; Leda said in a careful tone as she glanced over at Serena again.
She hard blinked as she realized that the winged blonde now looked thoroughly
dejected, her glowing wings hanging limply from her back as she sat half-curled
in a ball in the chair.  &quot;Hey, Serena, take it easy....&quot;
     &quot;Rei and Ami could feel my emotions earlier,&quot; Serena said, her triple-tone
voice barely more than a whisper.  &quot;Rei said it felt like a leak, that she was
aware of my mood throughout the day and that it wasn&#39;t something she could
easily ignore.  Ami was distracted by it, too....&quot;
     &quot;It was just a general feeling of unease,&quot; Ami spoke up quietly, moving
over to where Susan was with the last reprogrammed communicator in hand.  &quot;It
wasn&#39;t something that could be pinned down, and I honestly can&#39;t say if it was
being caused by Serena or not.  Rei seemed to think it was, but I&#39;m not sure
how much of that was her simply looking for a scapegoat excuse.  Here,&quot; she
added softly as she handed the device to Susan.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Susan said absently, keeping her focus on Leda and Serena.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Artemis said as he sat up in Mina&#39;s lap.  &quot;You didn&#39;t mention any
of this earlier,&quot; he said over his shoulder, giving the blonde an uneasy look.
     Mina sighed quietly.  &quot;Honestly?  It slipped my mind.  Okay, so more than
a few people at school noticed that Serena was in a glum mood, but let&#39;s be
honest for a moment.  What kind of mood would you be in on a Monday after you
spent a few days in a personal hell during the weekend?&quot;
     &quot;Exactly what I tried to tell everyone,&quot; Leda spoke up.  &quot;Thing is, our
moody pyromaniac didn&#39;t feel like listening to me earlier, so she wasn&#39;t any
help.  What we agreed on, Susan, was to ask you to see if you can feel anything
for yourself.  If you don&#39;t, that would suggest Serena isn&#39;t &#39;leaking&#39; emotions
as Rei rather tactlessly put it, and that Serena doesn&#39;t have to worry about
her mood swings.  At least, no more so than usual,&quot; she added absently.
     &quot;Leda....&quot; Ami said in a reproving tone.
     &quot;Oh, c&#39;mon, Ami, even you have to admit that there is more than a little
truth to what they say about blondes being moody....&quot; Leda pointed out.
     &quot;Ahem,&quot; Mina spoke up with a loudly faked cough.
     &quot;Leave me out of this one, babe,&quot; Alex added in a faint warning tone.
     Susan raised a hand.  &quot;Anecdotal evidence about hair-coloring aside, I
have no reason as of yet to suspect that the Princess is able to directly or
subconsciously influence the emotions of those around her.  Nevertheless, I
shall remain vigilant for any such indications that this may be happening.  As
to the question of spiritual sensitivity, I am aware that the Princess&#39; aura
has undergone a.... change in tone, if you will, that does indeed feel slightly
different than it used to.  However, the strength and intensity of her aura has
most certainly not changed, which leads me to believe that nothing significant
has changed either.&quot;
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Whisper spoke up carefully.  &quot;What precisely did you feel earlier?&quot;
     Ami glanced over at Serena and sighed quietly before moving to sit down
next to Mina on the couch.  &quot;It was just a general feeling of.... unease, like
something was there that was bothering me.  Or at least that my.... my vampiric
side could pick up on,&quot; she admitted quietly.
     &quot;Are you still feeling that way now?&quot; Susan inquired.
     Ami blinked hard at the realization and lifted her head up, looking over
at Serena again.  &quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;In fact.... I don&#39;t think
I&#39;ve felt it since we left the school.&quot;
     &quot;See?&quot; Leda said with a soft sigh as she craned her neck to look up at the
ceiling.  &quot;I told you Serena wasn&#39;t leaking emotions.  Feeling better now?&quot; she
added as she caught motion out of the corner of her eye, turning her head to
watch as Serena&#39;s wings began to slowly float in the air once more.
     &quot;A little,&quot; Serena admitted quietly as she slowly let her breath out.
     &quot;Bah, such optimism,&quot; Leda grumbled as she picked up her pen and scratched
out another section of her list of things to talk to Susan about.  &quot;You can
unkink your panties now, girl, we won&#39;t look.  Like I said, I really think it
was just an all-around crappy day at school, which is par for the course on a
Monday.&quot;
     &quot;Sue, where have I heard that expression before?&quot; Alex spoke up as she
made her way on over to unoccupied armchair with Michelle in tow.  She gingerly
sat down and fluffed the cushion behind her back before drawing her lover down
to sit in her lap, wrapping her arms around her waist to keep her steady.
     &quot;It is in reference to the scoring mechanism used in the game of golf,&quot;
Susan replied with just the faintest hints of a sigh.  &quot;Par is the average
number of attempts needed to hit the ball into the cup, and the course is the
overall layout of holes to play on.&quot;
     &quot;Golf,&quot; Mina muttered as she shook her head.  &quot;Another fine invention of
the Scots.  Robin Williams had the right idea behind its origins.&quot;
     Susan paused and tilted her head carefully to regard the young girl.  &quot;If
I didn&#39;t know better, Lady Venus, I would say that you have something against
the Scottish culture,&quot; she said in a somewhat guarded tone.
     Mina looked up at her with a faint smirk on her lips.  &quot;I&#39;m English, what
do you expect?&quot; she said lightly.  &quot;Maybe not nearly as much as Grams is, but
still enough to count for such things, if only for pure amusement value.&quot;
     &quot;I am aware of a measure of historical animosity between the English and
the Scottish clans,&quot; Susan said in a measured tone, &quot;But that hardly gives you
or anyone in this contemporary era any license for casual contempt simply for
the sake of amusement.  Especially when you are unaware of the exact heritage
and lineage of your friends and allies.&quot;
     Mina paused as she suddenly got the impression that she had just tossed a
frisbee into a mine field.  &quot;Susan?&quot; she said with deliberate slowness.  &quot;You
aren&#39;t Scottish yourself, are you?&quot;
     &quot;Uh-oh,&quot; Leda said quietly at the change in Susan&#39;s expression.
     &quot;My mother,&quot; Susan said, her voice suddenly taking on a somewhat thick and
distinctively Scottish brogue, &quot;Was Deborah Meiou of the clan Galbraith and
could trace her ancestry back five generations.  That she was a Sailor Scout
was an unknown to the clan, but she wore the tartan and kilt whenever she was
on Earth and was readily welcomed by her kin despite her isolationist ways.
To them, she and her immediate ancestors were merely rogue sheep who cared more
to wander the Highlands than stay with the family, but they were still family
nonetheless and heartily welcomed whenever they cared to visit the homeland.&quot;
     &quot;Hey, uh.... Sue?&quot; Alex spoke up as Mina cringed slightly.  &quot;Maybe I just
wasn&#39;t paying attention at the time or something, but I don&#39;t recall you ever
mentioning anything like that.  Or hearing you talk like that,&quot; she added.
     Susan sighed quietly and leaned back, her expression turning more than a
little withdrawn.  &quot;I have little desire to speak of my mother or her heritage
these days,&quot; she said quietly, her voice free of any hint of an accent.  &quot;The
memories are.... not to say unpleasant, but intertwined with my foolishness as
a child.  Her soul was lost, and I am wholly to blame for it.  Forgive me if I
have little desire to be reminded of the pain I have carried since then.  She
spoke with the same accent as they did, and the accent remained with me for a
measure of my youth until I made a conscious effort at removing it.  Indeed, I
sometimes wonder if my fascination with a more modern and contemporary English
culture is simply a result of.... subconscious over-achievement.&quot;
     &quot;Susan, I didn&#39;t mean to disrespect your mother or her clan,&quot; Mina spoke
up in a careful tone.  &quot;But all things being equal, you have to admit that golf
is a pretty unusual sport that the Highlanders invented.&quot;
     &quot;And what of cricket?&quot; Susan countered lightly.
     Mina shook her head.  &quot;Don&#39;t ask me, I never was able to figure that one
out for myself, either.  Croquet and polo I can understand, but the way I see
it, cricket is more than a bit of a one-off as far as sports go.&quot;
     A faint smile touched Susan&#39;s lips.  &quot;I strongly suggest you don&#39;t say
that aloud in places like Camden and Yorkshire,&quot; she said demurely.  &quot;At least,
not unless you desire to be lynched or burned at the stake for blasphemy.&quot;
     &quot;Trust me, I usually keep my sports opinions to myself,&quot; Mina muttered.
&quot;Or at least when there are known testosterone-laden fanatics around.&quot;
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Leda said with an air of dismissal.  &quot;So back to the issue of
Serena&#39;s moods.  Seriously, girl, I think you&#39;re worrying entirely too much
about this one.  Okay, so you&#39;re an angel now and you need to be careful about
letting it show.  That&#39;s not difficult when you stop and think about it.  I
mean, look at Ami, she&#39;s been a vampire for how long now?&quot;  She paused for a
moment before looking over her shoulder, giving the blue-haired girl a slightly
quizzical look.  &quot;Hey, just how long *has* it been, anyway?&quot;
     Ami blinked in surprise at the question before her gaze became vacant as
she turned her focus inwards.  &quot;About nine months now, give or take,&quot; she said
in a faintly resigned tone as she refocused on the brunette.
     &quot;Wow,&quot; Leda said quietly before she nodded and turned back to Serena.
&quot;Okay, so she&#39;s been a vampire for close to a full year now, and there are how
many people at school who know about it?  Only us,&quot; she answered as the blonde
remained oddly silent.  &quot;By god, Serena, her own *mother* doesn&#39;t know about
this, and they live together!  I think if Ami can keep things that quiet for
that long and not even tip off her mother, who is a *doctor* and knows more
about the human body than the rest of us put together, probably including Susan
there as well....&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Susan admitted with a faint smile on her lips.
     &quot;Leda,&quot; Ami spoke up quietly, causing both Leda and Serena to blink at the
odd tone she was using, &quot;I know you&#39;re trying to comfort Serena and all, and
while I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll have many problems keeping her denizen side hidden
away from everyone, don&#39;t try to use me as an example.  I hardly see my mother
anymore, which is more by design these days than simply a result of her work
schedule.  I know when I have to be home and when I don&#39;t need to be there.
Which is why I have to go soon,&quot; she added absently as she glanced over at the
clock on the wall.  &quot;But timing aside, there have been instances where I know
I&#39;ve slipped, both at school and in my mother&#39;s presence.  I&#39;m fortunate that
nobody will notice the change unless they&#39;re paying attention to my eye color,
but even then it doesn&#39;t stand out like the changes to Serena&#39;s eyes.&quot;
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Leda sighed as she looked up at the ceiling, fully aware of the
suddenly glum look on Serena&#39;s face.  &quot;You&#39;re supposed to be helping me here,
not making things worse.  She&#39;s already frightened as it is about Rei&#39;s pissy
reaction earlier.  And I still say it&#39;s a bucket of bullcrap,&quot; she added as she
gave the long-haired blonde a measured look.  &quot;C&#39;mon, when was the last time
the pyro passed on an opportunity to blame you for something?&quot;
     Serena sighed heavily and looked down at her lap, her wings drifting back
and forth in apparently random patterns.  &quot;I know,&quot; she whispered quietly.
     &quot;You might want to cut Rei a little slack for a moment,&quot; Mina spoke up in
a faint tone of warning, drawing a leery glance from Leda.  &quot;Keep in mind that
Serena wasn&#39;t the only one who had things turned inside-out during our little
weekend adventure.  I&#39;m willing to bet she&#39;s still rattled fairly hard on the
inside, and you know how hard it is to get her to uncork the bottle without
triggering another volcanic eruption.&quot;
     &quot;I think she&#39;s got a point, babe,&quot; Alex spoke up.  &quot;I know I&#39;ve got a bit
of a wicked temper, but Rei scared the hell out of me when she went off on the
Princess back in Sue&#39;s fog-bubble world or whatever it was.&quot;
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Leda muttered as she briefly rubbed her face with her
hands.  &quot;But one emotional crisis at a time here, okay?  Umm.... dammit,&quot; she
sighed.  &quot;I had a thought earlier, but I think I just lost it....&quot;
     Both Alex and Mina opened their mouths in the same instant to make an off-
color comment.  They were quickly convinced to change their minds before they
could speak, however, Alex by a far-from-subtle prod from Michelle&#39;s elbow and
Mina by the distinctly sharp sensation of Artemis flexing his claws against a
patch of bare skin.
     &quot;Try your notes,&quot; Ami suggested quietly, casting a sidelong glance at Mina
and trying to figure out why her facial expression had changed so abruptly.
     &quot;Notes, notes....&quot; Leda muttered to herself as she scanned the array of
paperwork on the table.  &quot;Ah, yes, that&#39;s right.  Susan, we&#39;ve got another
question for you about how your wings work and all.&quot;
     &quot;Very poorly,&quot; Susan replied with a quiet chuckle.  &quot;I do not have enough
wing surface or muscle strength to permit powered flight, although I can glide
reasonably well from a suitable height.&quot;
     Leda blinked and cast a brief sidelong glance at Serena.  &quot;Umm, that&#39;s not
what I meant,&quot; she said carefully.  &quot;We were wondering about how you went about
dealing with the issue of having to stretch your wings or whatever when you&#39;ve
got something covering your back.&quot;
     &quot;The tear-through issue with your Sailor Suit,&quot; Alex added.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Susan said with a nod of understanding.  &quot;Thank you for reminding me
of that, Alex, as I had been meaning to inquire about that myself.&quot;
     &quot;Whoa, slow down,&quot; Leda protested as she make a &#39;time-out&#39; gesture with
her hands.  &quot;I think we&#39;re starting to cross a wire here....&quot;
     Susan shook her head gently.  &quot;If I may, Leda, I think I may be aware of
the precise nature of your concern.  In any case, I ask that you permit me to
raise my own concerns first, which may in turn serve to answer yours in part.
The emergence of my wings is a purely physical event that very much conforms to
known and established multi-dimensional physics.  Simply put, attempting to
release my wings while wearing something would be no different that inflating
a balloon inside a sock.  One of two results will occur: Either the sock will
rip and allow the balloon to finish expanding, or the balloon will be confined
by the sock and become deformed.  The same applies to my wings, either what I
am wearing will be torn or I will wind up imploding my wings in a distinctly
painful, if spectacular, fashion.&quot;
     Alex grunted softly as Michelle made a muted squeaking sound to herself.
&quot;Yeah, there&#39;s a cheerful thought,&quot; the short-haired blonde muttered as she
absently rubbed Michelle&#39;s arm.
     &quot;With my Sailor Suit,&quot; Susan continued, &quot;Or at least the previous design
I had been using, the material stretched over my back had been deliberately
thinned out in two places so that it would easily rip if I attempted to release
my wings while in an empowered state.  However,&quot; she added with a faint sigh,
&quot;It seems that my suit has been &#39;defaulted,&#39; if you will, to the original basic
design that lacks a number of features that I had grown accustomed to.&quot;
     &quot;Like missing bras?&quot; Leda spoke up in a somewhat dry tone.
     &quot;That, and a few minor tailoring adjustments to conform to my individual
measurements,&quot; Susan replied with a nod.  &quot;I presume that the rest of you are
likewise less-than-satisfied with the current design of your Sailor Suits?&quot;
     The everyone except Artemis and Whisper nodded somberly.  &quot;Bras would be
a nice touch,&quot; Mina spoke up, causing a faint blush to appear on at least three
sets of cheeks.  &quot;And if it&#39;s possible to make a few nip-and-tuck adjustments
here and there for creature comfort, that&#39;d be icing on the cake.&quot;
     Susan nodded and glanced over at Serena.  &quot;That would be the domain of the
Royal House, as only the Imperium Silver Crystal can exert such an influence on
our transformations.  Your Highness, may I please see the Crystal for a moment?
I should like to consult.... an old associate,&quot; she said delicately.
     Serena seemed to hesitate before she nodded and reached up to her chest,
blinking hard as she realized that she wasn&#39;t wearing the golden brooch.  A
brief wave of panic swept through her before she remembered that she had left
it in her room when she had changed out of her school uniform.  &quot;Hang on,&quot; she
said as she rose to her feet, absently flicking her wings off to the side to
avoid brushing them against the table as she turned around.  The glowing wings
trailed after her as she left the room, seeming to naturally flow in a classic
butterfly shape with her movements.
     &quot;You&#39;re right, Susan,&quot; Leda spoke up as she glanced over at what she had
written down to ask about.  &quot;That only partially answers the concern.  Yeah, so
that&#39;s how it works with you, and that really explains a few quirks about your
behavior, but the real question is how does it work with Serena and her wings?&quot;
     &quot;I would imagine that the process is similar,&quot; Susan admitted.  &quot;However,
even if were to presume that she is bound by the same multi-dimensional laws of
physics, her wings do not possess bones or other rigid internal structures as
mine do and thus are far less susceptible to imploding.  Also, given their
original size and physical density when they first emerged, I do not think that
her wings would be significantly harmed should she encounter a compression
effect caused by a shirt or a bra.  I would expect her to experience a moderate
degree of bruising, of course, but nothing that would require immediate or
otherwise complicated medical treatment.&quot;
     &quot;Like we would know how to help her if she gets a wing caught in a door
or anything,&quot; Mina pointed out in a faintly sour tone.  &quot;Or at least I don&#39;t.
Ami, you&#39;re the unofficial medic, you have any ideas?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;d try opening the door first,&quot; Ami replied in a dry tone, prompting
chuckles from Leda and Alex, a muted giggle from Michelle, and a rolling of the
eyes from Mina.
     &quot;Thank you, Doctor Sterling,&quot; the blonde sighed.
     &quot;Sterling?&quot; Susan echoed with open curiosity, looking over at Ami.
     A delicate blush spread across her face as she studied the pleats of her
school uniform skirt.  &quot;Tolaris used it as his last name when we first met, as
he knew humans used a family name in addition to their given name,&quot; she said in
a somewhat muted tone.  &quot;It&#39;s been a bit of a running joke ever since.&quot;
     Mina smirked as she leaned back and absently stroked Artemis&#39; soft white
fur.  &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll appreciate hearing you say that,&quot; she teased.  &quot;Oh, sorry
to disappoint you, Tolaris, but Ami said that becoming a doctor and marrying
you was all a running joke....&quot;
     &quot;Hey, now,&quot; Artemis purred quietly as Ami shot the blonde a distinctly
unamused look.  &quot;At least Tolaris has a plan for that.  What has Maze said?&quot;
     &quot;Oh, that was taken care of months ago,&quot; Mina replied with a dismissive
wave of her hand.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure what he&#39;ll try to pass off as his last name,
but he&#39;ll be using Aino once we&#39;re properly married and all.&quot;
     &quot;Mina?&quot; Leda spoke up in a distinctly uneasy tone.  &quot;I remember him doing
that at the hospital to get past the receptionist, but I got the impression he
was just being a goofball at the time.&quot;
     The blonde just shrugged in reply.  &quot;Okay, so maybe I haven&#39;t broken it
down for him just yet, but he&#39;ll get all clued in one of these days.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Ami said, giving Mina a startled look.
     &quot;Oh, lord....&quot; Leda sighed heavily.
     Susan looked up as Serena returned to the room holding the golden brooch
that housed the Imperium Silver Crystal.  &quot;There are a number of historical
precedents for situations in which the groom adopts the family name of his
bride as his own instead of the opposite as tradition dictates.  This is most
often when there are several heirs of the groom&#39;s bloodline who can carry on
the family name but none left who could pass on the bride&#39;s name.  Thank you,
your Highness,&quot; she added as she gently accepted the brooch.  She sat up and
very lightly ran her fingertips over the sealed cover, almost as in a caress as
she focused her thoughts on the gemstone hidden inside.
     A soft white light began to seep out from around the edges of the cover,
persisting for a number of seconds before the lid rose up of its own volition.
The Imperium Silver Crystal itself seemed to shed a calming glow as it became
exposed to the room, the facets seeming to twinkle in an almost subtle fashion
like the pinpoints of light that ran the length of Serena&#39;s angelic wings.
     &quot;Iri?&quot; Susan said softly as she very lightly touched the Crystal itself.
The glow seemed to increase where her skin made contact with the facet edges
before a very faint and mellow humming sound filled the air.
     &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it, Susan,&quot; a tired and distinctly musical voice
said as a spectral image took shape, standing a few feet away from where the
succubus was seated.  The image resolved into the weather-worn face of a woman
wearing a truly prismatic gown, the tiny sequins seeming to display a literal
kaleidoscope of colors that changed from one moment to the next.  Her outline
remained somewhat transparent, and as with the manifestation of Queen Nectaris,
the expanse of her eyes had become replaced with a featureless black that was
as deep and empty as the void of space itself.
     Susan smiled gently as she stood up and curtsied before the past Queen.
&quot;It is good to see you again, your Majesty,&quot; she said demurely.  &quot;And no, I
don&#39;t blame you in the slightest for the reversion of the modifications to our
Sailor Suits to the original template.&quot;
     The spectral queen snorted quietly to herself, shaking her head ever so
slightly.  &quot;Of course not, I&#39;d smack you square on the bottom if you did,&quot; she
said dryly.  &quot;Even if it means rooting through the kitchen cabinets to find a
proper sauce-pan.  So now I&#39;m summoned to meet our problematic Moon Princess in
person, am I?&quot; she said with a soft sigh as she turned to face Serena, studying
her carefully.  &quot;Susan, please tell me her attire is your doing,&quot; she added in
a critical tone, giving Susan a mildly reproving look.
     &quot;Your Majesty, please,&quot; Susan said quietly as she saw the look on Serena&#39;s
face.  &quot;Serena, I should like you to meet Queen Iridum.  Her Majesty once took
it upon herself to attempt to &#39;domesticate&#39; a young Lady Pluto, whom she felt
had improperly overlooked her training as a potential wife and home-maker for
a future husband,&quot; she explained with a measure of amusement.  &quot;I forget the
precise length of her Majesty&#39;s efforts before effectively writing me off as a
lost cause, but I do not hesitate to admit that I learned much during my tenure
as her handmaiden.&quot;
     Both Susan and Iridum looked over towards the other armchair as they heard
a muffled sound, both raising their eyebrows at the sight of Michelle&#39;s hands
firmly pressed against Alex&#39;s mouth and giving the spectral queen a distinctly
abashed look.  &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Michelle said demurely with a bow of her head,
still forcefully keeping the Viking from making any public commentary.
     &quot;A wise precaution, I suppose,&quot; Iridum admitted with an absent shrug as
she turned back to look at both Susan and Serena.  &quot;But then again, I gave up
trying to keep track of what went on outside the Crystal ages ago.  That may
have been a mistake,&quot; she added, giving Serena a measured look.
     &quot;Iri,&quot; Susan said firmly, the edges of her mouth turning downward.
     &quot;I said I don&#39;t want to hear it, Susan,&quot; Iridum sighed before turning her
full attention to the winged princess.  &quot;Princess Serena, do not misunderstand
me, I don&#39;t have any animosity towards you personally in the slightest.  From
what we&#39;ve seen and heard recently, you truly are an angel at heart, and it is
hardly your fault that you were born half-human.  Indeed, after our initial
encounter with a hybrid,&quot; she added, casting a sidelong glance at Susan, &quot;The
initial consensus was that you wouldn&#39;t be giving anyone any problems so long
as your mother instilled you with the proper attitude towards life.  And until
the destruction of the Moon Kingdom, we had every reason to believe that you
were coming along just fine.
     &quot;However,&quot; the Queen said in a clear tone of both warning and unease, &quot;The
Moon Princess we all knew died in the assault, and with her our understanding
of what she was like.  You are clearly her reincarnation on Earth, as you are
in full possession of the purity and sanctity of her human spirit and soul, as
well it seems as the blood-legacy of her father.  Your mind, however, is not
hers, nor do you have the benefit of her memories and wisdom.  That worries us,
and it is that concern that forms the basis of the consensus that we cannot
risk a deeper degree of trust than what might otherwise be warranted and owed.&quot;
     Serena blinked hard and cast an uneasy look at Susan before looking back
at the translucent figure.  &quot;What do you want from me?&quot; she whispered softly,
her triple-tone voice wavering as she spoke.
     Queen Iridum blinked in surprise, clearly being caught off-guard by the
question.  &quot;What I want?&quot; she echoed.  &quot;Child, I wasn&#39;t asked to come here to
make demands of the living, although now that you ask I would appreciate it if
you could put on something a little more substantial.  Your wings are quite
breath-taking to look at and even an old woman like me can see that you are a
very attractive young woman, but there is simply no need for a Crown Princess
to have the royal charms out on display for the eyes of others,&quot; she said as
she briefly glanced down at the impossible-to-miss outline of Serena&#39;s nipples
against the sheer ribbon criss-crossing her chest.
     A fairly dark blush immediately exploded across Serena&#39;s cheeks as she
glanced over at Susan again, her angelic wings seeming to draw inward in a
slight cringing motion.  &quot;I.... don&#39;t have anything else with me that won&#39;t
confine my wings,&quot; she said in an apologetic tone.
     Iridum sighed heavily and cast a dark look at Susan.  &quot;Tell me you didn&#39;t
call me here to sew something for you,&quot; she said in a faintly edged tone.
     &quot;Of course not,&quot; Susan replied coolly, a delicate green eyebrow arching up
in response.  &quot;Having been thoroughly instructed by you on the matter, I am
more than capable of making a few gowns for the Princess that will permit her
wings to remain unencumbered while preserving her modesty to whichever degree
she favors for a given mood.  What I am unable to do, however, is instruct her
in the art of tailoring Sailor Suits to individual needs.  That, your Majesty,
is why I asked for your assistance as you are, to my knowledge, the one who
made the initial modifications to my own suit.&quot;
     &quot;Ah, I see,&quot; Iridum replied as she turned back to Serena, looking at the
winged princess in a somewhat different light.  &quot;I should warn the both of you
that it will take some time and no small amount of practice,&quot; she warned, more
to Serena than Susan.
     &quot;I am not concerned with the length of time required for this endeavor,&quot;
Susan replied calmly.  &quot;In fact, I would actually suggest that the both of you
take your time in doing so.  The Princess could use the instruction as well as
the opportunity to refamiliarize herself with the workings of the Crystal, and
you, Iri, may be well-served by getting to know her Highness as a person rather
than as a mere topic of discussion cast in an unfavorable light by the mindset
of the likes of Queen Andromeda.&quot;
     Serena blinked at the somewhat startled look on the spectral queen&#39;s face,
her void-like eyes staring off into space before refocusing and casting a mild
sidelong glance at the green-haired woman.  &quot;You&#39;re still a very manipulative
little tart, you know that?&quot; she said in a tone that was as reproving as it was
amused, the faintest hint of a smile brushing the edges of her lips.
     &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Susan replied with a deep bow of your head, &quot;I do believe
that&#39;s the first compliment you&#39;ve given me in two hundred years.  Thank you.&quot;
     &quot;Bah, off with you, woman,&quot; Iridum sighed as she made a shooing motion at
Susan.  &quot;You were a pain in the butt then, and it seems you are still capable
of being a pain in the butt now.  Now then, young lady, you and I need to find
a very quiet place for this, as I will need to teach you how to modify your own
suit first and it is likely you will accidentally expose yourself during your
instruction.&quot;
     &quot;I would suggest your bedroom, your Highness,&quot; Susan said gently as she
handed the still-glowing Imperium Silver Crystal to Serena.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; Serena replied in a subdued tone as she glanced back at the
spectral image standing before her.  She wordlessly accepted the brooch and
reflexively brought it up to her chest, pausing as she realized what she was
doing.  A moderate blush spread across her cheeks as she settled for cupping
the brooch in both hands and turning towards the residential hallway, her wings
seeming to fluff out behind her for a moment before settling back into their
usual pattern.
     Iridum sighed quietly and cast a quick glance at Susan.  &quot;Try to keep out
of trouble, Lady Pluto,&quot; she murmured softly.  &quot;It&#39;s bad enough my own House is
in a near-riot, I don&#39;t think it would bode well for any of us if you were to
further complicate things with your usual, though unintentional, mannerisms.&quot;
     &quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Susan replied simply with a bow of her head, watching as
the translucent figure followed Serena into the hallway in ghostly silence.
     &quot;Can I breathe now?&quot; Alex muttered darkly as she finally managed to pry
Michelle&#39;s hands off of her mouth.  &quot;C&#39;mon, Mich, you act like I was going to
insult her or something....&quot;
     &quot;Alex, please don&#39;t start,&quot; Michelle pleaded quietly as she allowed her
wrists to be grasped and gently pushed away.  She blinked as the force on her
arms was suddenly reversed, pulling her down into a firm kiss that was all but
impossible for her to resist.
     Leda cast a brief glance at the way Michelle all but melted against Alex
and shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;Yeah, keeping her quiet that way will work, too,&quot;
she said absently, more to herself than to anyone else.
     &quot;It works,&quot; Mina pointed out.  &quot;Or at least it does with Maze.&quot;
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; the brunette sighed as she looked up at the ceiling.  She paused
and glanced over at Ami as the blue-haired girl quietly stood up and made her
way over to the table, wordlessly collecting her homework assignments and study
materials together.  &quot;Ami, what&#39;s up?&quot; she inquired.
     &quot;I need to go soon,&quot; Ami replied quietly.  &quot;Mom&#39;s due to get off-shift in
an hour, and I need to be home before she does.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Mina grumbled as she cast a glance at the clock.  &quot;I might as well
get my butt in gear and head out as well.  What?&quot; she added as Artemis turned
around rather quickly to give her an uneasy look.
     &quot;I thought you said you weren&#39;t supposed to meet him until sundown,&quot; he
said in a faintly suspicious tone.  &quot;That&#39;s how many hours from now?&quot;
     Mina just rolled her eyes as she stood up, picking up the white cat in a
graceful motion so as not to dump him onto the floor.  &quot;I have a family too,
you know,&quot; she reminded him gently.  &quot;Okay, so they&#39;re used to me being out and
about socializing with my friends most of the time, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to be
home for dinner for once.  Besides, they won&#39;t try to bother me later tonight
if they think I&#39;m camped out in my bedroom studying for an upcoming test.&quot;
     &quot;Must be nice,&quot; Leda sighed quietly, still keeping one eye on the way Ami
was gathering her school books and homework together.  She paused as she heard
a very soft moan and cast a glance over to where Alex and Michelle were still
locked in what was best described as an intense snuggle.  &quot;Get a room, girls,&quot;
she said loudly as she looked up at the ceiling again.
     Everyone except Susan blinked hard as Alex promptly stood up with Michelle
still in her arms, slowly and gingerly carrying her in the general direction of
the residential hallway with only the briefest of interruptions in their kisses
so that Alex could make sure she wasn&#39;t going to bump into a wall.  Leda waited
until they disappeared around the corner before turning to look at the rest of
the group with a somewhat nonplussed look on her face.
     &quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that,&quot; Mina said with a casual shrug as she set
Artemis down on the table.  &quot;You told them to get a room.&quot;
     &quot;Yup,&quot; the brunette sighed in resignation.  &quot;So maybe Mom was right after
all, you really should be careful what you ask for.  Ami, are you alright?&quot; she
added as Ami hefted her backpack onto her shoulder in near-perfect silence.
     Ami paused for a moment before casting the briefest of glances towards the
empty residential hallway.  &quot;I&#39;m fine, it&#39;s just.... one of those days,&quot; she
admitted with a soft sigh.
     &quot;Ami?&quot; Whisper spoke up from her seat at the table.  &quot;I don&#39;t need to be
a telepath to pick on the fact that something is weighing on your mind at the
moment.  I&#39;m not trying to pry into your business or anything, but if something
is bothering you that your friends can help you with....&quot;
     The blue-haired girl just shook her head gently.  &quot;They can&#39;t,&quot; she said
softly.  &quot;But thanks anyway.  I&#39;ll see you all tomorrow,&quot; she said as she made
her way across the room towards the front door.
     &quot;Hey, hang on a second,&quot; Mina called out as she scrambled to stuff her
homework into a folder.  &quot;I still have a couple of idle questions for you about
that chemistry assignment, and I figured I could walk with you until we reached
the bus stop over near the library.  Damn, why does this thing have to be so
heavy?&quot; she complained as she zipped the oversized backpack shut and tried to
heft it onto her shoulders.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; Ami said, clearly not enthused about the prospect of having to
put up with Mina&#39;s company for a couple of miles.  She blinked as Artemis leapt
off of the table and trotted over to her, reflexively making a cradle with her
arm as the white cat jumped up.
     &quot;Hope you don&#39;t mind,&quot; he said with a large yawn, absently flicking his
tail back and forth.  He paused to cast a discreet glance at Mina as she began
to struggle to find a balance for the weight of her backpack that wouldn&#39;t put
her in any danger of being tipped over.  &quot;You&#39;re right, it definitely is just
one of those days,&quot; he added in a very quiet tone.
     &quot;I know,&quot; Ami said with a resigned nod.  She cast a quick glance towards
the residential hallway, more out of uneasy curiosity at what Serena was doing
with the Imperium Silver Crystal rather than anything Alex and Michelle might
have been doing together.  Not that it needs imagining, she told herself with
a faintly sour feeling in her abdomen.
     &quot;Okay, all set,&quot; Mina announced as she carefully lumbered forward, keeping
herself slightly bent at the waist to counter-balance her backpack.  She paused
as she went to scoop up Artemis, only to discover that he had wandered off when
she wasn&#39;t paying attention.  &quot;Hey, where&#39;s...?  Oh, nevermind,&quot; she added as
she saw where he was.  &quot;Anyway.  So about that one equation involving those
carbon-ring structures....&quot; she started to say as she plodded towards the door
with Ami in tow.
     Susan remained silent as she sat back in the armchair, idly studying the
weaving of the fabric on the arm rests.  She paused and glanced up as she felt
the weight of Leda&#39;s gaze, more than a little surprised to see the brunette
giving her a rather intense look.  &quot;Is something wrong, Leda?&quot; she inquired in
a gentle tone.
     &quot;You&#39;re awful quiet all of a sudden,&quot; Leda pointed out.  &quot;Usually when one
of us gets a case of the heavy thoughts, you&#39;re there chiming in with your two
cents to try to make us feel better or something.  Something started bugging
Ami a few moments ago, however, and you haven&#39;t said word one to her yet.&quot;
     &quot;What would you have me say, Leda?&quot; Susan countered gently as she glanced
back down at the edge of the armchair.  &quot;I believe I know what is weighing on
her mind, namely the matter of her present relationship with her mother, but I
do not think I can be objective enough in this instance to offer advice.  The
two best friends I have ever had in my entire life were her mother and Queen
Serenity, so of course I would be.... inclined to favor their side of a given
argument absent any obvious benefits of taking the opposing view.  However, I
must also remind both you and myself that the Amelia Anderson that I knew and
was close to died during the Moon Kingdom invasion.  Granted she seems to have
been reincarnated in this era like the rest of you, but as Queen Iridum pointed
out earlier.... her heart and soul may still be the same, but her mind is not.&quot;
     &quot;And?&quot; Leda said flatly.
     Susan sighed softly and glanced back up at her, studying the depths of her
green eyes.  &quot;The point, Lady Jupiter, is that Ami will have to reconcile her
concerns and differences with her mother on her own, and on her own terms.  I
have already suggested once that Amelia be made aware of her daughter&#39;s role as
a Sailor Scout as well as her own as a member of the House of Mercury, but the
idea was not well-received at the time.  Granted it will only be a matter of
time before that occurs through one means or another, but if Ami does not wish
to have any outside assistance or intrusion into her relationship with her
mother, then I will certainly not attempt to do so.&quot;
     &quot;Dammit,&quot; Leda sighed as she rubbed her face with her hands.  She paused
in mid-motion and glanced down at the assortment of homework and other papers
in front of her, trying to remember if she was forgetting something.  &quot;Bah,&quot;
she sighed heavily as she leaned back in the chair, putting enough of a strain
on it to cause it to creak slightly.  &quot;Why the hell do I feel so stressed out
all of a sudden?&quot; she asked the room at large.
     &quot;Suddenly or still?&quot; Whisper spoke up as she tossed back the last of her
denizen ma&#39;cha.
     Leda paused to mull over the telepath&#39;s words, absently collecting her
papers together in a neat pile.  &quot;I suppose you have a point,&quot; she admitted as
she sat back with another sigh and another creak from the chair.  &quot;I mean, I
know it seems like it&#39;s been a few days since we had to race against the clock
to rescue Serena from General Rune&#39;s clutches, but still....&quot;
     &quot;If I may, Leda,&quot; Susan said gently, &quot;I suspect it will take you several
days for the residual stress to &#39;bleed off&#39; on its own.  Returning to a normal
routine of school and quiet evenings of studying among friends should go a long
way in aiding the process.&quot;
     &quot;But that&#39;s just it,&quot; Leda pointed out.  &quot;For girls like Ami and Mina, it
just isn&#39;t the same to be in this place without having Tolaris and Maze around.
Hell, I miss those guys, and I&#39;m not emotionally involved with them.  And with
as long as we&#39;ve been hanging around here after school and the like, it would
feel out-of-place if we were to try to pal around somewhere else.  We can&#39;t
even casually meet at Rei&#39;s temple anymore because all those spiritual wards
drive Ami&#39;s vampiric side up the wall.&quot;
     Susan nodded in understanding.  &quot;I assure you I understand your concerns
in that regard.  Nonetheless, I would still recommend that you return to your
daily routines as much as the situation permits.&quot;
     &quot;Just so we can screw them all up again this weekend, eh?&quot; Leda reminded
her with a heavy sigh.  &quot;And that&#39;s assuming things stay &#39;normal&#39; around here
in the meantime, which at this point I think is being entirely too optimistic.
Blondie over there is supposed to meet with what&#39;s-his-butt tonight,&quot; she added
with a wave of her hand towards the front door of the cathedral.  &quot;Granted I&#39;ve
never met the guy until he spooked the hell out of Rei the other day, but even
the mere mention of his name sets off both Serena and Ami.  That tells me that
he&#39;s nothing but trouble, and that&#39;s the last thing we need more of right now.&quot;
     &quot;If it&#39;s any consolation, Leda,&quot; Whisper spoke up carefully, &quot;I&#39;ve already
told the computer to let the defenses go active and deal with him if he ever
tries to get near this building.  And if he gets past that, he&#39;ll have me to
deal with,&quot; she added with a faint edge to her otherwise calm tone.  &quot;And from
what I know of him, General Jedyt is not capable of fending off psionic attacks
well enough to save either his life or his sanity.&quot;
     Leda shrugged in indifference.  &quot;Hey, if he&#39;s anything like that bitch
Zoicite, you&#39;re welcome to fry his brain like an egg in a skillet for all I
care.  I&#39;m just saying that he&#39;s out there and that Mina&#39;s going to be giving
him a proverbial poke in the shoulder to see what he&#39;s up to.  That alone could
turn into a crisis situation, and that&#39;s just one of the things I can imagine
happening.  Lord knows what sort of situations a genius like Ami can picture
going down that&#39;ll screw up our lives yet again.  Hell, I&#39;m surprised nobody&#39;s
developed an addiction to antacids yet with all the stomach-churning headaches
that crop up with regularity around here,&quot; she added wryly.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Whisper said casually as she studied the faint ring of
ma&#39;cha left inside her empty cup.  &quot;With all the spices in your human foods, I
know I&#39;ve gone through more than my fair share of jen&#39;yan in a few months than
most denizens who aren&#39;t enthusiasts of avian cooking do in a decade.&quot;
     Both Susan and Leda raised an eyebrow at the change in Whisper&#39;s tone at
the end.  &quot;So what&#39;s the issue with avian cooking, aside from the tendency for
it to move while it&#39;s still on the plate?&quot; Leda inquired carefully.
     Whisper smirked.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that some of the foods they eat are more
than a little spicy by our standards.  A&#39;hiele is great with some spices, but
not all kiosks that serve it use the same seasonings.  I think the equivalent
in this world would be something like your General Tso&#39;s chicken recipe.&quot;
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Leda said as she cast a thoughtful glance towards the kitchen.
&quot;Ra&#39;vel never said anything to me about avians serving stuff like that.  You
think I could give it a shot?  I mean, it is kinda close to dinner and all.&quot;
     Whisper blinked and turned her thoughts inward for a moment.  &quot;I&#39;m not
sure we have the right foodstuffs available, but I can certainly check.&quot;
     &quot;A question, if I may, Leda,&quot; Susan spoke up in a carefully pitched tone.
&quot;You don&#39;t normally attempt to cook denizen foods, do you?&quot;
     Leda blinked at the question and gave her a slightly puzzled look.  &quot;I do
that all the time,&quot; she replied.  &quot;Granted I don&#39;t usually try to come up with
something that Ra&#39;vel calls a taste of home, mind you, but more often than not
that&#39;s only because we don&#39;t have the right ingredients here.  Why?&quot;
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Susan said with a mild look of surprised enlightenment.  &quot;So may I
safely presume you routinely attempt to cook exotic foodstuffs to palatability
despite the fact that you&#39;ve never tried a given recipe before?&quot;
     &quot;Yeah....&quot; Leda said slowly, giving her an openly suspicious look.  &quot;Why
do I get the feeling you&#39;re having me state the obvious for a reason?&quot;
     Susan just gave the brunette a demure smile.  &quot;If I may, Leda, I would be
of the mind that, for you, cooking the unknown in the kitchen would be not so
much commonplace as.... routine,&quot; she said, putting a subtle emphasis on the
last word as she leaned back in the armchair.
     It took Leda a few moments to decide just how to respond to the succubus&#39;
words and the realization of why she had spoken them as deliberately as she
had.  &quot;You know, I&#39;m beginning to understand why you drive Alex up the wall on
occasion,&quot; she said in a faintly weary tone.  &quot;But then again, I was never one
for the art of being subtle.  And you know what?  That Queen Iridum was right,
you are a little on the manipulative side.  But anyway,&quot; she said as she rose
to her feet and started to clear off the table.
     &quot;Leda....&quot; Susan started to say.
     &quot;Just keep this one in mind,&quot; Leda said, cutting her off with a look that
was somewhere between cautioning and unfriendly.  &quot;Things didn&#39;t start getting
hectic around here until you showed up.  Not that I&#39;m blaming you for any of it
or anything, and I&#39;m being honest when I say you seem to be worth the odd event
that crops up because of your presence, but your frustrating insistence on
mystery and cryptic wording of everything is just as much of a reminder of how
our &#39;routine&#39; lives have been thrown out-of-whack as dealing with the Negaverse
ever was.  Umm, no offense,&quot; she added to Whisper with the faintest hint of a
blush on her cheeks.
     Whisper just shook her head sadly.  &quot;None taken, I assure you.  I know how
things are in my world,&quot; she admitted.  She watched in silence as Leda finished
clearing the table and headed into the kitchen without another word.  Sighing
quietly to herself, she glanced down at her empty mug before looking over at
Susan.  &lt;She has a point, you know,&gt; she telepathed quietly as she stood up.
&lt;It wouldn&#39;t hurt if you simply made your point in plain terms that are easy
for all to see and understand.  Not like Alex does, of course, but still.&gt;
     &quot;Thank you, Captain,&quot; Susan said quietly, almost too quietly for Whisper
to hear.  &quot;I will.... endeavor to try to keep that in mind.&quot;
     Whisper looked at her for a moment before mentally shrugging, not having
the faintest idea if the green-haired woman was being sincere or sarcastic or
something else entirely.  It&#39;s expected, I suppose, she thought to herself as
she carried her empty mug into the kitchen to be washed.  Constantly wrap your
words in a veil of mystery and it isn&#39;t long before anything you say is rarely
accepted at face-value....

                *               *               *               *

     Darian sighed softly to himself as the elevator doors parted in front of
him, revealing the narrow and somewhat brightly-lit hallway of his apartment
complex.  He usually tried to take the stairs up to his floor after work, but
he was feeling more than a little weary tonight given the disturbing events at
the office earlier.
     I&#39;m not sure I want to hear that one explained, he thought grimly as he
plodded down the hallway to his door.  Reaching for the keys in his pocket had
been a completely automatic gesture, seeming to appear in his hand as if by
magic as his focus briefly slipped back into the recent past.  The disconnect
in his memory caused him to pause for an instant before he shrugged it off and
unlocked the door, feeling a sense of relief washing over him as he entered the
small apartment that he called home.
     Another introspective moment of thought and contemplation resulted in a
second momentary disconnect of his mind and his body, almost causing him to
drop the bottle of water he was holding as he sat down in the recliner.  Huh?
he thought as he glanced around, realizing that he had somehow tossed his suit
jacket over the back of the chair in the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water
from the refrigerator, all without conscious thought or active memory.  Man, I
think I need a vacation, he told himself as he leaned back in the chair with a
heavy sigh.
     A faint chill hit him a moment before he heard the soft but firm knocks on
his door, causing him to cast a very wary sidelong glance towards the kitchen
area.  The chill wasn&#39;t nearly as strong as it has often been in the past, both
distant and recent, but he could still tell when someone with a dark soul from
the Negaverse was nearby.  &quot;No rest for the weary, eh?&quot; he muttered softly to
himself in heavy resignation as he slowly rose to his feet, still holding the
bottle of water.
     Like it or not, a dark voice bubbled up from the depths of his memories,
the fate of two worlds lies solely in your hands now.  The sooner you discharge
your burden, the sooner you will be free from my influence.  Remember that.
     Great, Darian thought sourly as he unlocked the door without bothering to
check through the peep-hole.  Now I&#39;ve got the voice of the NegaForce coming to
mind as well.  Let&#39;s just get this over with, he grumbled as he swung the door
open only to freeze in mid-motion at what he saw.
     &quot;Good afternoon, Prince Darian,&quot; Jedyt said casually, smirking as he saw
the surprised look on Darian&#39;s face.  &quot;I hope I&#39;m not interrupting anything.&quot;
     &quot;Only what&#39;s left of my peace of mind,&quot; Darian sighed, giving the blond
denizen a very wary look.  &quot;I take it Zoicite left detailed instructions on how
to find my apartment?&quot;
     Jedyt shrugged absently.  &quot;It&#39;s probably the only useful thing she&#39;s ever
done, aside from keeping Malachite in a tolerable mood most days.  Not that it
matters anymore.  I was in the neighborhood and needed to kill an hour or two
before my little meeting with our dear Sailor V, and so I figured that I&#39;d drop
by to see how you were doing.  Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not here to start any trouble
or anything,&quot; he added.
     Darian raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I don&#39;t know, pal, I thought that&#39;s what you
said the other day when you went to Rei&#39;s temple,&quot; he reminded him darkly.
     Jedyt sighed quietly and rubbed the bridge of his nose.  &quot;As I told V, I
didn&#39;t intend to cause a deep rift between you and Serena, merely to needle her
one final time.  Consider it payback for the passenger jet incident, one that
I am more than willing to let rest now.  I don&#39;t blame you for not trusting me,
Darian, but I&#39;m not here to ask for your trust.&quot;
     &quot;So why are you here?&quot; Darian inquired neutrally as he twisted the cap off
of his bottle of water and took a casual sip.
     &quot;Simply to talk, my prince, nothing more,&quot; Jedyt replied in a level tone.
&quot;You would be surprised how a little information about a few key details can
drastically change one&#39;s views of a situation.  Or of a person,&quot; he added.
     &quot;You mean Serena,&quot; Darian pointed out.
     &quot;Her and you,&quot; the denizen clarified.  &quot;You are the Crown Prince, Darian,
and as I just said, that little detail changes things.  May I?&quot; he inquired
with a slight gesture to the door.
     Darian studied him carefully before sighing softly to himself and taking
a step back, opening the door wider to allow Jedyt to enter.  &quot;Don&#39;t make me
regret this,&quot; he warned in a faintly edged tone.
     Jedyt cast a slightly irritated look at Darian as he carefully entered the
small apartment.  &quot;Somehow, Darian, I don&#39;t think I have much to do with any
regrets you might be having at the moment.  Having said that, you will find
that I have no desire to add to either your problems or my own by upsetting
your precious Sailor Scouts.  Or at least not unduly so.&quot;
     &quot;Meaning?&quot; Darian prompted as he closed the door behind his unexpected
visitor, casting a sidelong glance over his shoulder.
     Jedyt smirked as he crossed his arms and leaned against the archway that
separated the kitchen from the living room.  &quot;Meaning I&#39;m sure that the simple
fact that I came here to talk to you would be enough to upset them.&quot;
     &quot;With good reason,&quot; Darian pointed out as he brushed past him and returned
to his recliner in the living room.  He swivelled the chair around so that it
faced the couch, making a casual gesture with his water bottle to the cushions
on the far end.
     &quot;Thank you, your Highness,&quot; Jedyt said as he made his way over to the
couch and sat down.  He paused and glanced over the small assortment of pillows
that were stacked on the other end, one eyebrow arching up as he noticed that
the circular gray one appeared to be moving.  &quot;Found a new friend, I presume?&quot;
he said to Darian without taking his eyes off of the fuzzy object.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Darian said, leaning forward slightly as he realized what it was
Jedyt was looking at.  &quot;Oh, her,&quot; he sighed as he leaned back, also keeping a
wary eye on the gray ball of fur.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s correct to say she&#39;s
Sailor Pluto&#39;s cat, but she&#39;s a known entity.  Not that I have the slightest
idea of why she&#39;s here instead of with the others,&quot; he added with a shrug.
     &quot;A cat, how quaint,&quot; Jedyt commented as he continued to study Myst for a
few moments before shrugging in dismissal.  &quot;No matter.  If you don&#39;t mind my
saying so, Darian, I actually like what you&#39;ve got set up here,&quot; he said as he
took his time in looking around the room.  &quot;It&#39;s a touch small in my opinion,
but then again I&#39;ve always preferred large open spaces.&quot;
     Darian made an idle gesture at the compliment.  &quot;Finding an apartment in
the city like this isn&#39;t easy, so you have to live with what you can afford,&quot;
he pointed out.  &quot;Besides, it&#39;s not like I need a lot of space anyway.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose,&quot; Jedyt allowed as he glanced down the hall that led to the
bathroom and bedroom.  &quot;So anyway, I take it life on Earth has been good to
you?  Aside from the occasional friction between your world and mine,&quot; he added
with a knowing smirk.
     Darian gave him a measured look as he took another sip of water.  &quot;Let&#39;s
just say that I don&#39;t have many noteworthy complaints,&quot; he said dryly.  &quot;And
don&#39;t get me started on the Negaverse, okay?  We&#39;re still trying to calm down
after that kidnapping stunt of Rune&#39;s.&quot;
     A quiet grunt rose up from Jedyt&#39;s throat as he sat back and closed his
eyes, a deep frown crossing his face as he crossed his arms.  &quot;Yes, I remember
Rei telling me about that last night,&quot; he muttered.  &quot;I had nothing to do with
it, despite the fact that it supposedly took place shortly after our little
group meeting, but I don&#39;t really expect any of you to believe me.&quot;
     &quot;No, we believe you,&quot; Darian said before he took a fairly large gulp of
water from the bottle.  He let his breath out with a somewhat explosive sigh
before adding, &quot;Sailor V mentioned how she had been following you since you
left Rei&#39;s temple, so we know whatever went down wasn&#39;t your doing.  Speaking
loosely of which.... you said you dropped in on Rei last night as well?&quot;
     Jedyt paused for a moment before giving the Earth prince a slow nod.  &quot;I
did,&quot; he said in a faintly wary tone.  &quot;Our conversation was interrupted the
first time when her fellow Sailor Scouts showed up, so I thought I would try
talking to her again.  It was no different than what you and I are doing now,
only with the cozy ambience of a burning fireplace,&quot; he added with a smirk.
     &quot;I&#39;d be careful in dealing with her,&quot; Darian warned.  &quot;You know what they
say about playing with fire.  Especially when she has every reason in the world
to hold a grudge against you.&quot;
     &quot;Believe me, I know,&quot; Jedyt countered with a faint grunt.  He paused and
glanced down at Myst as the kitten stirred in her sleep, briefly stretching her
paws out and flexing her claws impressively before curling back up into a ball
of silky gray fur.  &quot;In any regard, Rei mentioned during our conversation that
our dear Sailor Moon&#39;s denizen blood decided to manifest itself in a rather
prominent fashion and in a supposedly unique way.  Something about wings.&quot;
     &quot;And?&quot; Darian inquired in a neutral voice as his face lost virtually all
expression.
     Jedyt paused briefly at the other man&#39;s reaction.  &quot;I asked Rei if I could
be allowed to meet with Serena to see her denizen wings for myself,&quot; he said in
a careful tone.  &quot;While Rei was kind enough to ask her for me, the response I
got was.... not something you want to repeat in polite company,&quot; he said as a
smirk crossed his face.  &quot;I have to admit being fairly shocked to hear her say
such things, and I daresay Rei was all but speechless as well.&quot;
     Darian shrugged casually.  &quot;Hey, I don&#39;t blame her for telling you where
to stick it,&quot; he pointed out.  &quot;In fact, I&#39;m surprised she didn&#39;t send someone
like Sailor Uranus over to handle that one for you.&quot;
     &quot;Actually, I think the offer was made,&quot; Jedyt sighed.  &quot;But Rei had the
good sense to decline.  In any case, Prince Darian, I would still like to find
a way to meet with her and see her wings for myself, and quite frankly I don&#39;t
care what the conditions are so long as I&#39;m still alive and unharmed when our
conversation is over.  I don&#39;t suppose you would be willing to intervene on my
behalf, by chance, and convince her to meet with me?&quot;
     Darian came dangerously close to venting the last mouthful of water out
his nose in surprise that Jedyt had bothered to ask for his help.  &quot;You&#39;ve got
to be kidding me,&quot; he said, coughing lightly as he thumped his chest.
     &quot;Not in the slightest,&quot; the denizen general assured him in a somber tone.
&quot;As I told Rei, I don&#39;t care if you have me tied to a chair with her friend&#39;s
sword held to my throat, just as long as I can see her wings for myself.&quot;
     &quot;Humor me for a moment here,&quot; Darian rasped before he turned his head to
one side to cough as forcefully as he could.  &quot;Bah, hate it when that happens.
So explain to me what your hard-on is for seeing her wings?&quot;
     &quot;My...?&quot; Jedyt started to echo before he remembered how the slang term was
properly translated in his native language.  He snorted quietly in contempt and
crossed his arms tightly.  &quot;Very cute, your Highness.  Very well, I shall speak
plainly then.  Rei told me that someone said that Sailor Moon could be one of
the Heralds of Chaos, ie ay&#39;chen Ar&#39;kanis il&#39; Hal&#39;al.&quot;
     Darian raised an eyebrow as Jedyt fell silent, as if the simple statement
was enough to explain everything.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;m with you so far,&quot; he prodded.
     Jedyt blinked in surprise before sighing quietly, reaching up to lightly
massage his sinuses.  &quot;I&#39;m trying to think of an equivalent translation in your
world&#39;s mythology.  I think it would be akin to having your Jesus Christ walk
the Earth once again.  How many millions, if not billions, of humans would come
from every part of your planet to meet him for themselves, to bask in his holy
glory and beg for his forgiveness, for their own salvation?&quot;
     Darian froze for several moments as he considered the implications before
he up-ended the water bottle, draining it completely.  He then screwed the cap
back on and casually pitched it across the room, watching as it rebounded off
of the wall and ended up somewhere in the kitchen.  &quot;So you&#39;re saying she&#39;s a
goddess now?&quot; he inquired carefully.
     &quot;Far from it,&quot; Jedyt replied, glancing down at Myst as her ears perked up
at the noise from the kitchen.  &quot;However, if she truly is what I think she is,
she will be revered as a legend.  That will change the political landscape in
my world in a way that you can&#39;t even begin to imagine.  I think you woke up
the cat, by the way,&quot; he added as Myst lifted her head up and opened her eyes.
     &quot;She&#39;ll be alright,&quot; Darian said absently.
     &quot;Who, Serena or the cat?&quot; the denizen inquired carefully.
     Darian simply shrugged to himself.  &quot;Both, really, though I have to say I
was talking about Myst a moment ago.  Sorry about that,&quot; he added as the gray
kitten yawned and looked over at him.
     &quot;At least you&#39;re quieter than they are,&quot; Myst muttered as she started to
yawn yet again.  She tensed as Jedyt jumped to his feet and took a few steps
back, starting intently at her even as she turned to look at him.
     &quot;Easy, pal,&quot; Darian said with a faint smirk.  &quot;She won&#39;t bite.  Claw you,
maybe, but she won&#39;t bite.&quot;
     &quot;How charming,&quot; Jedyt replied with a faint scowl.  &quot;I take it you&#39;re a
sentient being, then?&quot; he said to the Shinma.
     &quot;I am,&quot; Myst replied in a faintly wary tone.  She paused and craned her
neck forward a few inches, sniffing the air intently.  &quot;You smell like one of
those other-worlders, like Maq&#39;i and Whisper are.&quot;
     Jedyt raised a blond eyebrow at the kitten&#39;s words.  &quot;Yes, I am a denizen
like they are,&quot; he said carefully.  &quot;Not that I would be surprised that you&#39;ve
met Captain Whisper already, but how would you know of Master Healer Maq&#39;i?&quot;
     &quot;Long story,&quot; Darian spoke up with a mental wince on the inside.  &quot;Let&#39;s
just say we needed a hand when we brought Serena back from the Imperial Castle
and Maq&#39;i was kind enough to cooperate.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose that should have been expected,&quot; Jedyt replied with a slight
shrug, very carefully moving to sit back down on the end of the couch.  &quot;Most
of the Healers I&#39;ve met tended to be protective of their patients, regardless
of who they were.  She is, I trust, feeling better?  Sailor Moon, that is.&quot;
     Darian nodded carefully.  &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s fine, all things considered.&quot;
     &quot;Who are you?&quot; Myst inquired warily, not sure what to make of the denizen.
     A faint smirk crossed Jedyt&#39;s face.  &quot;I would say an old friend of Prince
Darian&#39;s, but he might have an objection to the term.  Needless to say, he and
I have known one another for awhile now.&quot;
     &quot;Much to my chagrin,&quot; Darian added in a faint tone of warning.
     &quot;As I said, Darian, things are different between us now,&quot; Jedyt sighed.
&quot;Or if nothing else, at least from my perspective.  I will not apologize for
what happened between us in the past, as I had my orders from Queen Beryl, but
by the same token I don&#39;t hold anything against any of you for defending your
own planet.  And as I said earlier, I&#39;ve largely gotten over that last incident
at the airport and can easily forget the rest.&quot;
     &quot;And why&#39;s that?&quot; Darian inquired cautiously.
     &quot;Simply because it no longer matters now,&quot; Jedyt replied with a dark sigh.
&quot;Queen Beryl is dead, the sum of my life&#39;s work all but erased, and my future
looks fairly dismal.  What is there left, Prince Darian?  Vengeance?  If what
I think is true, that your precious Serena is indeed the Ar&#39;kanis il&#39; Hal&#39;al,
then my choices are fairly stark in contrast: seek forgiveness from the one who
will reshape our world, or be one of those cast into the abyss of oblivion once
she sets the prophecy into motion.  If it isn&#39;t already in motion as we speak,&quot;
he added in an ominous tone.
     Darian paused and raised an eyebrow at the note of drama that had crept
into the denizen&#39;s voice.  &quot;You know, I would almost think you believe that,&quot;
he said after a few moments of studious silence.
     Jedyt sighed and rolled his eyes at the ceiling.  &quot;No, Darian, I walked
across several of your city blocks just so I could come here and wax dramatic
about the end of my world,&quot; he said with open sarcasm.
     &quot;Beats standing on the street corner wearing a toga and holding a sign,&quot;
Darian pointed out with a measure of dry humor.
     Jedyt just shook his head to himself and rubbed his sinuses again for a
number of moments.  &quot;All bad humor aside, Darian, I would appreciate it if you
would consider asking Serena to meet with me, even if it is only for a brief
moment or two.  She doesn&#39;t even have to speak to me, just allow me to see her
wings for myself.&quot;
     Myst snorted very softly as she began to preen her whiskers.  &quot;She looks
like a gloam,&quot; she muttered.
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t help,&quot; Jedyt pointed out carefully.  &quot;I have no idea what a
&#39;gloam&#39; looks like.&quot;
     &quot;Myst?&quot; Darian spoke up with a slight frown.  &quot;You should let me take care
of this one.  Jedyt isn&#39;t exactly on our side, and I think it&#39;s safe to say
Serena would be quite pleased if he had the decency to leave our world alone.
Or at least just leave our world,&quot; he added in a measured tone, casting a flat
look over at the denizen.
     &quot;As I had to explain to Rei,&quot; Jedyt countered in a somewhat testy voice,
&quot;It seems that my Silkworm crystal has gone missing and so I can&#39;t just up and
leave this little blue planet of yours.  And Rei wasted little time in pointing
out to me that Sailor V had the audacity to pick my pocket earlier, so if you
have any problems with my presence here on Earth I suggest you raise the issue
with that little blonde slut at your earliest convenience.&quot;
     Darian shrugged in indifference.  &quot;Or you could simply wait until you meet
with her later today,&quot; he countered.  &quot;Oh, and I would be careful about calling
Sailor V such names, at least when you&#39;re a guest in my apartment.  She&#39;s a
definite screwball, alright, but not anywhere close to the way you suggest.  I
know Serena would be rather offended to hear you say such things,&quot; he added.
     &quot;I&#39;m sure she would,&quot; Jedyt said in a neutral tone.  &quot;Sailor V has been a
thorn in my ptanka for far longer than Sailor Moon has, although V has been
more of a persistent annoyance than an outright threat.  However, having said
that, there is still a great deal of unfinished business between us that has
yet to be settled with any measure of satisfaction.&quot;
     &quot;Word of advice?&quot; Darian replied in a faintly edged tone.  &quot;You might want
to bend over and pluck that weed out of your backside before leaving here to go
meet her.  I&#39;m not sure what the two of you are going to talk about, and to be
honest I don&#39;t really give a damn at this point, but I know her well enough to
be able to say that if you walk in there with an attitude problem like that,
you probably won&#39;t be walking back out.&quot;
     Jedyt snorted quietly to himself.  &quot;I&#39;m touched by your concern, Darian,
but I think I can handle dealing with Sailor V on my own.&quot;
     &quot;Your funeral, pal,&quot; Darian replied with a dismissive shrug.  &quot;I&#39;m just
warning you that they seem to have reached their limit of tolerance for you,
and I&#39;m about there myself.  If you&#39;re going to try to convince us that you&#39;re
not going to bother us anymore, you really should let your actions speak for
themselves.  Oh, and not to be a dick or anything, but don&#39;t let me find out
that you tried to hurt Sailor V tonight or something,&quot; he added as a truly dark
scowl suddenly crossed his face without warning.  &quot;I may not have any sort of
cosmic power backing me up like the Imperium Silver Crystal or the NegaForce,
but I can still make sure you&#39;ll regret starting anything.&quot;
     The denizen paused at the abrupt change in Darian&#39;s demeanor, one blond
eyebrow raising up in response to the overt warning.  &quot;There&#39;s no need for such
threats, your Highness, as I will not be the one to &#39;start anything&#39; tonight,
but rest assured I will be keeping your &#39;advice&#39; in mind.  In any case I sense
I&#39;ve overstayed my welcome, so I&#39;ll be going now.  Thanks for your time,&quot; he
added as he started to stand.
     &quot;Sit down,&quot; Darian said in a quiet but commanding tone, his face still a
somewhat dark mask of turbulent emotions.
     Jedyt blinked at his tone before very carefully easing himself back down
on the couch cushion.  &quot;You&#39;re in an imperial mood all of a sudden,&quot; he pointed
out in a faintly uneasy tone.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me that being the Crown Prince of
the Negaverse has started to have an influence on your cheerful personality.&quot;
     &quot;You don&#39;t know the half of it,&quot; Darian sighed quietly as he allowed his
eyes to close for a few brief moments.  &quot;I just thought about that &#39;favor&#39; you
asked for earlier, and while I still don&#39;t see Serena agreeing to anything I am
willing to ask her for you.... providing you promise to try to repay the favor
once you get your Silkworm crystal back and return to the Negaverse.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; Jedyt assured him in an openly wary tone.
     &quot;It&#39;s a simple matter, really,&quot; Darian replied as he leaned back in the
recliner.  &quot;Just pass word to Admiral Si&#39;ren that I&#39;d like to meet with her in
a quiet and private setting for a few minutes.  We can work the details out at
a later date, I just want her to know I&#39;m interested in meeting with her.&quot;
     &quot;About...?&quot; Jedyt prodded.
     &quot;None of your business, pal,&quot; Darian countered.  &quot;You&#39;re just going to be
my messenger for this one, and the message is simple: I&#39;d like to meet with her
at some point, preferably in the visible future.  You don&#39;t even have to stick
around to hear her answer, just give her the message and that&#39;s it.  If she&#39;s
interested, I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll find a way to return my message on her own.&quot;
     A faint smirk crossed Jedyt&#39;s face as he leaned back against the cushions.
&quot;You don&#39;t ask for much, do you?&quot; he observed dryly.  &quot;It is likely that the
good admiral isn&#39;t even aware that I&#39;m still alive, and I&#39;m not sure I want to
clue her in to that little detail.  I suspect that things would get quite ugly
if I were to be spotted by anyone in the Imperial Castle, in fact.&quot;
     &quot;So send her an anonymous postcard,&quot; Darian replied in a flat tone.  &quot;I&#39;m
not asking you to tweak her nose and whisper into her ear here, I just want her
to be aware of my request and I don&#39;t care how it&#39;s done as long as it&#39;s done.&quot;
     &quot;And in exchange you&#39;ll ask Serena to meet with me?&quot; Jedyt inquired in a
tone that was quite difficult for Darian to read.
     Darian paused and raised an eyebrow, giving the denizen general a rather
cool look.  &quot;You&#39;re acting like I&#39;m the one with the credibility problem here,&quot;
he observed in a faintly chilling tone.
     The smirk returned to Jedyt&#39;s face as he slowly shook his head to himself
at the change in Darian&#39;s mood.  &quot;I see part of Queen Beryl&#39;s charm has rubbed
off on you,&quot; he replied in a faintly languid tone.
     &quot;Like I said, I&#39;m pretty much out of tolerance when it comes to dealing
with denizens and the Negaverse,&quot; Darian stated darkly.
     &quot;Very well, Prince Darian,&quot; Jedyt said, still smirking as he rose to his
feet.  &quot;I will try to see that your message makes its way into Admiral Si&#39;ren&#39;s
hands.... assuming, of course, that I both survive my little get-together with
Sailor V and she is kind enough to give me my Silkworm crystal back.&quot;
     &quot;She will,&quot; Darian assured him.
     &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; the general added.
     &quot;What, you don&#39;t trust me?&quot; Darian inquired calmly.
     It took Jedyt a few moments to decide how best to respond to that.  &quot;Let&#39;s
just say that trust seems to be a precious commodity these days,&quot; he observed
in a fairly neutral tone.  &quot;Having said that, I will not bother arguing with
you over it since fulfilling your request hinges on a few conditions that are
in our little short-skirted blonde&#39;s control.  I&#39;ll let you know if I&#39;m able to
get in touch with Si&#39;ren for you.&quot;
     &quot;Do that,&quot; Darian replied as he swung the footrest up and reclined back
into a half-horizontal position.
     Jedyt seemed to pause for a moment before shaking his head to himself.
&quot;Fair evening, your Highness,&quot; he said lightly with a mock bow before he left
the room in relative silence.
     Myst waited until she heard the opening and closing of the door before she
cast a very uncertain glance towards Darian.  &quot;Who was that?&quot; she inquired in
a somewhat guarded tone, not sure what to make of either the conversation or
the suddenly weary expression on Darian&#39;s face.
     &quot;General Jedyt from the Negaverse,&quot; Darian sighed as he closed his eyes.
&quot;He gave us a few nasty problems last year when the Negaverse was busy causing
all sorts of trouble here on Earth, and it was up to Serena, Ami, and Rei to
deal with him.  I gave them a helping hand when they needed it, but let&#39;s just
say that my timing was questionable at best and the bulk of the actual work was
their doing.  Needless to say, they don&#39;t like him.&quot;
     &quot;He&#39;s strange,&quot; Myst pointed out as she hopped down from the couch and
padded across the floor over to where he was stretched out.  She cast a very
critical eye at the amount of space on the footrest before changing her mind
and leaping up onto the armrest.
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Darian sighed in dismissal, absently reaching out to lightly stroke
her silky gray fur.  &quot;He&#39;s actually fairly normal, or at least as far as Earth-
invading militant denizens go.  Why are you here, anyway?&quot; he added, cracking
open one eye to look at her.  &quot;I thought you&#39;d be with Susan and the others at
the cathedral.&quot;
     A somewhat flat growl emerged from her throat as she flicked her ears back
against her head.  &quot;Michelle is the only calm one over there,&quot; she complained.
&quot;Alex is loud and obnoxious, and Whisper&#39;s mind-powers are dangerous.  I tried
to shift planes after she gave me a headache, and she somehow followed me into
that spectral realm.  The only other places I know how to find are this place
and Leda&#39;s apartment, so I thought I&#39;d try here first.  Her place smells odd,&quot;
she added sourly.
     A faint chuckle rose up from his chest, having a fair idea of the exact
smell that was bothering her.  &quot;That&#39;s just the kind of carpet deodorizer she
uses every so often,&quot; he said.  He and Serena had visited her once after she
had just finished cleaning the carpets, and it had taken him a fairly long time
to get used to the distinct and rather pungent smell of eucalyptus.
     &quot;Still,&quot; Myst protested quietly.  She closed her eyes and began to make
the faintest of purring sounds as Darian reached up to gently scratch her ears.
&quot;So who&#39;s this person you wanted him to ask to meet you?&quot;
     &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; he explained as he closed his eyes again and tried to
relax.  &quot;She&#39;s a denizen like Jedyt, but she never came to Earth to harass us
or was otherwise hell-bent on bringing death and destruction to our part of
town.  There&#39;s a couple questions I&#39;d like to ask her, and I&#39;d like to see just
how cooperative this Crown Prince business will make her.  I&#39;m fairly sure that
even if it doesn&#39;t do a damn thing, it won&#39;t make our situation any worse.  Or
so I hope,&quot; he added.
     &quot;You don&#39;t sound confident,&quot; the kitten pointed out, unconsciously leaning
against his hand as he continued to lightly scratch her ears.
     Darian sighed heavily.  &quot;If you think humans are disruptive, you haven&#39;t
met many Negaverse denizens then,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Granted they tend to be far
more predictable than we are, but they can be just as irrational as humans when
surprised or confronted with an unknown.  And that&#39;s the problem, as I&#39;m sure
Si&#39;ren is going to be quite surprised when she finds out I want to ask her a
few questions.&quot;
     &quot;What could she do?&quot; Myst asked in a faintly sleepy tone despite the fact
that she had spent most of the afternoon in various stages of unconsciousness.
     &quot;You&#39;d be surprised, Myst,&quot; Darian murmured.  &quot;You&#39;d be surprised....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;I have to admit that this is a surprise,&quot; Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet said with
a faint smile as she stood up from behind her desk.  &quot;I had been told that the
two of you were with the rest of your fellow Red Wings aboard the V&#39;ral before
all this nonsense started.&quot;
     &quot;Until recently, I was,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled calmly as he and Sirene were
escorted into Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s office by a white-robed attendant.  He waited until
the attendant had left and closed the door behind her before continuing, &quot;I 
found it necessary to return to the Imperial Castle to discuss a few matters of
importance with Admiral Si&#39;ren, but it seems she has more pressing concerns to
tend to first.  She suggested that we pay you a visit in the interim.&quot;
     The smile on Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s face grew wider at his words.  &quot;Did she, now?&quot;
she replied, her voice almost a purr.  &quot;Well, then, if you indeed have some
idle time on your hands that needs disposing of, you have certainly come to the
right place.  I take it this is the first visit here for the both of you?&quot;
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis affirmed with a nod of his head.
     &lt;Yes, ma&#39;am,&gt; Sirene added an instant later.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet mocked gently, giving Sirene a studious look.  &quot;While
I am a divisional commander and a flag-rank officer of the military, I do not
encourage formality from my guests provided they are here simply to relax for
a period of time.  Feel free to leave your rank in the same bin as your clothes
when you change, as there are only guests and attendants within my realm.
     &quot;As this is your first visit,&quot; the brigadier continued, &quot;Let me explain
how things are normally done and what you may expect.  Most of our guests need
only to speak to a registrar and ask for whatever services they had in mind, at
which point the registrar will make the necessary arrangements.  The staff is
more than capable of handling walk-in requests, though we do ask that you make
an appointment ahead of time whenever possible or if you have specific needs or
requirements so as to give us sufficient time to prepare for your arrival.
     &quot;You will be taken to a private changing room where you are to undress
completely and put on the provided white robe and slippers.  You need not be
concerned about personal modesty during your session, as every single member of
our staff are trained professionals who are about as familiar with the details
of the ethics regulations as most judicial magistrates.  While you are being
tended to, any clothing placed in the orange bin will be given a dry-cleaning
treatment and pressed so as to be ready by the time you are.  Items left in the
white bin will not be disturbed and will otherwise be secured until you are
finished with your session.  In your case, general, we can arrange to have your
armor cleaned and polished by one with experience in heavy-armor maintenance,&quot;
she added.
     &quot;Duly noted,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis observed in a neutral tone.  &quot;Please continue.&quot;
     A faint smile crossed Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s face as she nodded.  &quot;As for how your
time is spent in relaxation here.... that is up to you,&quot; she purred.  &quot;Believe
me when I say that we can most likely accommodate whatever you happen to come
up with.  Most of our guests enjoy our attended hygienic services, as very few
things relax the body like a soak in a hot tub followed by a gentle massage.
Should your focus be more on the mind than the body, we can arrange for all
sorts of environmental changes and influences to suit your needs.  We almost
always have at least one denizen meditating in a light and sound room at all
times, so we are quite experienced in providing that sort of service.  I sense
you have a question, my dear,&quot; she added as she saw the look on Sirene&#39;s face.
     &lt;I&#39;m not sure what you meant by attended hygienic services,&gt; Sirene spoke
up, the voice emerging from her vocoder sounding a little flatter than usual.
     Zan&#39;zemet made a slight gesture with her hand.  &quot;That is where you have an
attendant with you during the course of your relaxation,&quot; she explained.  &quot;If
you choose to soak in a tub, he or she will be there with you to tend to your
needs as desired.  We have both male and female attendants available, and the
registrar will ask which you prefer when the session is arranged.  You can also
usually specify which denizen species you want your attendant to be, though we
may not always be able to satisfy that request given availability issues.  You
would be surprised by how many requests I get for Felinoids,&quot; she added with a
slight raising of her eyebrows.
     &lt;And who will be wearing what again?&gt; Sirene inquired warily.
     Zan&#39;zemet raised a delicate eyebrow.  &quot;You, nothing,&quot; she said carefully.
&quot;After all, one doesn&#39;t bathe dressed.  As for your attendant, you may ask that
they wear a swimsuit if you wish, otherwise they will disrobe along with you.
Providing they wear clothes to begin with,&quot; she added with a faint twinkle in
her eyes.  &quot;As I said, Felinoids are in a noteworthy demand for such things.&quot;
     &quot;And the chosen method of relaxation?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired in a calm tone.
     &quot;Again, that is specified when the session is booked,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied.
&quot;Should there be any requests or a need for clarification, your attendant will
discuss that with you before anything begins.  Just so nobody gets the wrong
impression of what is expected to happen.  You still seem uneasy, my dear,&quot; she
said to Sirene at the continued look of uncertainty on her metal-masked face.
     &lt;Let&#39;s just say I&#39;ve heard rumors about what kinds of services are offered
here,&gt; Sirene pointed out.  &lt;And I don&#39;t mean a simple back-massage, either.&gt;
     A faint smirk tugged on the edges of Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s lips.  &quot;Come now, we are
all adults here and can speak freely as such.  Should you desire sexual release
as part of your relaxation session, or even if that is your sole objective in
your visit, you need only to explain that to the registrar who will make the
appropriate arrangements.  We provide the utmost discretion with our services,
all of them, so you need not worry about matters in that regard.  I take great
care to ensure that what happens within my realm remains here,&quot; she stated in
a firm tone.  &quot;You are here to relax, so we make every effort to see that you
have little to worry about at all by coming to us.&quot;
     &lt;And if I just want a simple soak in a hot bath?&gt; Sirene prodded.
     &quot;Then that is what you will get, my dear,&quot; the brigadier replied calmly.
&quot;No more than what you desire, and certainly no less than what you expect.  If
I may, the vast majority of our service staff has had some degree of medical
training and expertise, and most of my specialists could easily have gone to
work in the medical field.  Indeed, whenever Medical has a shortage of nurses,
we are quite literally their reserve staff.  Now having said all that, let me
assure you that tending to someone with external cybernetic implants is hardly
a new or novel experience for us.  If you happen to desire a given service for
relaxation, we can easily accommodate you.&quot;
     &quot;Major,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled calmly as Sirene remained silent.  &quot;I do not
believe it likely that we will be returning to the V&#39;ral for several hours, if
at all tonight.  You may consider yourself to be in a stand-by state for the
time being, and I assure you that you will be given ample advanced-notice if we
are to depart the Castle.  Should you wish to indulge, you are more than free
to do so.  I would almost go so far as to insist that you do so,&quot; he added with
a faint chuckle that drew a slightly wary look from her.  &quot;If nothing else, you
have earned it for your tolerance of my presence in your aircraft.&quot;
     &lt;Understood, sir,&gt; Sirene replied.  The synthetic voice from her vocoder
was hard to read, but there was perhaps a suggestion of dryness to her tone.
She turned her attention back of Zan&#39;zemet and seemed to hesitate slightly, her
expression clearly conveying a sense of indecision.
     &quot;May I make a suggestion based on a few casual observations and my own
personal experiences?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet spoke up lightly.
     &lt;Please,&gt; Sirene said with a nod.
     &quot;You are, obviously, an aircraft pilot,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said as she took a step
back to openly study the cybernetic woman.  &quot;That means you spend a lot of time
sitting around with little room to stretch.  That you are based on an airborne
carrier suggests that fresh water isn&#39;t so readily available as to permit one
to soak in a hot bath.  I&#39;m not sure about your implants as I haven&#39;t examined
them in detail, but they do not appear to be waterproof.  Water-resistant, of
course, but not to the point of allowing a full immersion, correct?&quot;
     &lt;Correct on all accounts, ma&#39;am,&gt; Sirene replied.
     Zan&#39;zemet nodded and moved to sit back down at her desk, turning most of
her attention to the small keyboard that was three-quarters hidden under the
desk.  A simple tap of a key caused the glassy surface of her desk to light up,
acting as a giant display screen.  &quot;Unless you object, I think you would find
an attended bath to be to your liking, followed by a suitably-focused massage
of your joints.  Let me see if she&#39;s.... ah, yes, she is,&quot; she added to herself
as she scrolled through a series of display menus and report screens.  &quot;As you
have expressed a little hesitation for this, I figured that you would be most
comfortable with a female attendant, one who is most likely older than you and
has more than a little knowledge of cybernetics.  She will make an excellent
guide for you on your first trip through my realm of relaxation,&quot; she said as
she looked up at Sirene with a warm smile.  &quot;I just made the arrangements and
she will be getting the page momentarily.&quot;
     &lt;Thank you,&gt; Sirene replied automatically, blinking fairly hard at the
change in her situation.  She blinked again and turned around as the office
door opened, allowing a middle-aged woman to stick her head inside.
     &quot;I take it my break is over now?&quot; she inquired with an impish look.
     &quot;Now that is service,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet spoke up, clearly taken by surprise at
how quickly the page had been answered.  &quot;Or have you always been a speedster
and never bothered to tell me?&quot;
     &quot;You have good timing, Zan,&quot; the attendant said with a chuckle.  &quot;I was
just passing through on my way over to the front lobby when you paged.&quot;
     &quot;Timing is indeed everything,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied with a chuckle of her
own.  &quot;Bael, this young lady has just been scheduled for a nice soak in room
H-14 and needs a bit of assistance.  Also, this is the first time she has paid
a visit to Hospitality, so I figured that an experienced touch would be best.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, really?&quot; she said, her expression visibly brightening as she looked
over at Sirene.  &quot;I so much enjoy fresh blood.  Welcome, Major,&quot; she added with
a genuine smile.  &quot;I&#39;m Bael.  Oh, relax, I&#39;m just kidding about the blood and
all.  It&#39;s not that often that I get to be the one to introduce a denizen to
the wonders of Hospitality.  Might I ask for your name?&quot;
     &lt;Major Sirene,&gt; Sirene replied in a faintly wary tone.
     &quot;Oh, my, is that a T-34 model vocoder?&quot; Bael inquired with open wonder as
she listened to the synthetic voice coming from the device on Sirene&#39;s throat.
     &lt;No, it&#39;s a modified T-32,&gt; was the somewhat self-conscious reply.
     &quot;With regenerating monofiliment waveguides, right?&quot; Bael prodded.  She
smiled as Sirene nodded, giving the cybernetic woman a look of understanding.
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I know just how to help you with that.  I&#39;ll need to ask you a
few questions about the rest of your implants, if you don&#39;t mind, but we can
take care of that on our way over to the bathing facility.  I need to check on
the specifics of your session anyway.  Come on, you&#39;re going to love this,&quot; she
added with another smile as she reached out to gently take Sirene by the elbow.
     It took Ar&#39;kanis an effort to keep himself from laughing softly at the
expression on Sirene&#39;s face.  &quot;At ease, Major, and enjoy your experience.  I
doubt we will be able to indulge like this again in the near future, so you may
as well make the best of it while you can.&quot;
     &lt;Yes, sir,&gt; Sirene replied with a nod.  &lt;Ma&#39;am,&gt; she added to Zan&#39;zemet
before she followed Bael out of the office.  Ar&#39;kanis turned to watch their
departure, turning back to face Zan&#39;zemet once the door was closed behind them.
     &quot;She&#39;ll be alright,&quot; the brigadier said lightly.
     &quot;No doubt that she will,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled in reply.  &quot;If I may, however,
her attendant didn&#39;t sound to be nearly as old as she appears to be....&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet waved a hand in dismissal.  &quot;That&#39;s Bael for you, old in body
but still young at heart.  She used to be an engineer at some point, which is
why she knows so much about cybernetics, and I doubt she has ever gotten over
the curiosity about mechanics that drove her into the field to begin with.  Not
that I bothered to ask why the career change,&quot; she amended with a shrug, &quot;But
I value her services all the same.  More so on days like this one.&quot;
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; the armored general replied with a nod of understanding.
     &quot;So, my dear general, what shall we do with you?&quot; she inquired as she gave
him an appraising look.  &quot;Visits from flag officers are not as often as I would
like, given the stress they are under from the burdens of command, but we still
know how to properly tend to them.  I&#39;m almost tempted to tend to you myself,&quot;
she added lightly, a faint smile tugging on her lips as she saw the way his
helmet tilted at her words.  &quot;Or did you think that I was simply a paper-pusher
who sits in her office all day munching on over-sweetened foods?&quot;
     &quot;Far from it,&quot; he assured her.  &quot;It is heartening to hear that you do not
hesitate to become directly involved in the line of duty as a proper division
commander should, though that tends to apply more to such things as field and
combat operations rather than administrative ones.  Having said that, I will be
more than content to settle for a hot bath and the privacy of solitude.&quot;
     &quot;Ahh, I see,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet purred quietly as she leaned back in her chair,
still openly studying his armor.  &quot;If you will humor me for a moment, am I to
presume you have a reservation for being seen without your armor?&quot;  She waited
for him to nod before continuing, &quot;I should like to assure you that I myself am
a Healer in my own right.  Granted not in certified practice, but I do claim an
equivalence of knowledge in the medical field.  If you have a medical basis for
your.... desire for solitude,&quot; she said delicately, &quot;Let me assure you that if
I cannot assist you in relaxing or otherwise make you comfortable, someone else
among my staff certainly can.&quot;
     A very soft sigh rose up from the depths of his helmet.  &quot;I understand and
appreciate your desire to help me, Brigadier....&quot;
     &quot;Please,&quot; she interrupted with a gesture.  &quot;We are both flag-rank officers
and are standing in what for all intents and practical purposes can be deemed
as neutral ground.  When the uniform comes off, and let me assure you it always
does in my division, the rigid formalities can be discarded with it.  Please,
call me Zan&#39;zemet,&quot; she said with a soft smile.
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled.  &quot;While I understand your desire to help me
relax, I trust you will forgive me if I am not so eager to unmask myself in the
presence of others.  Simple force of habit alone would make the experience....
uncomfortable on my part, and I assure you that you would not find it to be a
pleasant experience either.&quot;
     &quot;Please, humor me,&quot; Zan&#39;zement replied.  &quot;I have been a member of this
division since I was a decade shy of my two hundredth birthday, and believe me
when I say I have seen everything on everyone.  Scars, deformations, mutations
from the Chaos Factor, I&#39;ve seen them all and more.  I very strongly doubt, my
friend, that whatever lurks beneath your armor will be enough to rescind my
offer of tending to you personally, and in whatever capacity you desired,&quot; she
added with a somewhat coy tone.
     It took Ar&#39;kanis a moment to decide how he wanted to reply to her.  &quot;You
may safely presume that the Chaos Factor has had a role in my desire to remain
enshrouded in this armor, though it is not the sole reason.  This armor has
saved my life in more battles than you can imagine, as such is the danger one
faces when you lead others into battle from the forefront as a true general
ought, and so it is more of a close and trusted friend than most can imagine.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet made an idle gesture of dismissal.  &quot;No doubt that it has, and
no doubt that you value it as highly as others would their brothers and sisters
in battle.  But let us be practical for a moment and try to convince me that
you do not part ways when it is more of a hindrance than a help.  Or would you
have me believe that you sleep and bathe in that armor as well?&quot;
     &quot;Indeed I do not,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied.  &quot;But when I do such things I am not
in the presence of others, as this armor serves to protect them as well as it
serves to protect me.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet rose to her feet and edged around her desk, slowly making her
way over to him.  &quot;One usually should feel glad to see a knight clad in armor,
not fear his approach,&quot; she purred softly.  &quot;Should your armor act to contain
something harmful, that is one thing.  But even with as little as I know about
the art of warfare and the tools employed therein I can tell that this is not
the case.  It is not air-tight, nor would I think waterproof, so what power or
energy could it possibly contain?  Should you be seeking to spare me the sight
of something or otherwise conceal your own shame, I can honestly tell you I
will not flinch or shy away.  I have seen much in my life, enough so that I&#39;m
tempted to say I&#39;ve seen it all, and should that not be the case I would ask to
be shown anyway simply to add to my experience.  Please, remove your gloves for
me if nothing else,&quot; she suggested as she took his hand in her own.  &quot;I only
wish to help you.&quot;
     &quot;Be that as it may,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled very quietly, &quot;I would be the first
to say that I am beyond help in that regard.&quot;
     &quot;We won&#39;t know until we see for ourselves, now will we?&quot; she countered in
a faintly reproving tone.
     &quot;General Nop&#39;tera asked me to remove my helmet once,&quot; he warned, the echo-
effect of his helmet making his voice sound unusually chilly.  &quot;She bade me to
put it back on after a few seconds and did not ever ask again.  For a woman
with her nerve and fortitude, I found that to be quite telling.&quot;
     She raised an eyebrow and gave him a somewhat mild look.  &quot;With all due
respect, general, I find your attempts at stalling to be almost insulting.  I
am far from young, though I will admit to taking pains to ensure that one can&#39;t
tell that at first glance, and I am not some novice medical trainee.  Either
remove your gloves and let me see you, or go find a book in the library to read
to keep you occupied while you wait for Admiral Si&#39;ren to get back to you.  I
ask that you do the former,&quot; she added in a far more gentle tone.
     Ar&#39;kanis sighed heavily.  &quot;Very well, Brigadier,&quot; he said in an impersonal
tone as he grasped his right gauntlet in his left hand and gave it a slight
twist, just enough to disconnect the joint seal and allow him to slip it off.
He then held his arm up, allowing her the same view of his bare skin that he
had offered Sirene back aboard the V&#39;ral.
     The widening of her eyes in shock was as expected as it was.... what? he
found himself thinking.  Depressing?  Disheartening?  He knew what he looked
like, having to put up with his own reflection whenever he steeled himself to
look in a mirror, but the reaction of others on seeing him.... sometimes it was
more than he could bear.  He knew that it wasn&#39;t his fault, being a random
result of the Chaos Factor, but it still weighed just as heavily on his mind
and soul as the heavy armor did on his body.
     He paused and refocused as he felt her fingertips brushing against his
skin, very lightly tracing their contours.  The look of horror in her eyes was
gone now, or at least very thoroughly masked, and was now replaced by a look of
almost morbid fascination.
     &quot;Amazing,&quot; she whispered to herself.  She glanced up at him for a moment
before she made the faintest of chuckling noises deep in her throat.  &quot;You are
right, my friend, I have never seen anything like this before.  Oh, the shape
of your hand itself is not new,&quot; she added, very carefully brushing her fingers
over the claw-like protrusions from his fingertips.  &quot;I would almost say that
they are as solid as Felinoid claws, but no matter.  Is this the only concern
you have with your skin, then?&quot;
     &quot;If there is a greater concern, Zan&#39;zemet, then I myself would rather not
be told of it,&quot; he rumbled quietly, not entirely sure what to make of the look
on her face.  For all her experiences with the horrors of battle, Nop&#39;tera had
not been able to look at his skin for longer than a few seconds before turning
her gaze aside and asking him to remask himself.  Yet he was now being touched
and studied by a woman who was perhaps not even a fourth of the Dark General&#39;s
age and certainly lacked her experience in the gory details of war and death,
but was not only unafraid but rather keenly interested in his condition.  It
was enough to disturb him in ways he had rarely been disturbed before.
     &quot;Hold still, then,&quot; she murmured as she quickly moved over to her desk.
She opened a drawer and pulled out a small device before returning to his side,
carefully passing it back and forth over his exposed skin.  It took him several
moments to realize that she was holding a portable medical scanner, able to see
the readings for himself as it reported his blood pressure, skin temperature,
and a slew of other values that he wasn&#39;t able to immediately make sense of.
     &quot;Well, my friend,&quot; she finally said after scanning his arm for what was
likely a full minute, &quot;If it is any consolation, your skin is in perfect health
for being in this state.  I can see why most would find it.... disconcerting to
look at, but I have long ago learned that beauty really is only skin-deep.  I
presume the rest of your body is just as.... revealing?&quot; she said, seeming to
falter for a moment before looking up at his helmet.
     &quot;All but my wings,&quot; he rumbled quietly, flexing them gently.
     Zan&#39;zemet nodded absently as she glanced down at the medical scanner in
her hand, carefully tapping in a series of commands.  She studied the results
for a moment before an odd smile tugged on the corners of her lips.  &quot;Well, I
will be honest with you, my friend.  I cannot help you with your skin, save for
helping you wash it, of course, which I am still more than willing to do if you
desire.... but I know someone who just might be able to help you in a far more
tangible fashion.  Would you be willing to come with me and let her examine you
in a little more detail than I have?&quot;
     There was the faintest of rasping noises inside his helmet, almost as if
an eyebrow was being raised.  &quot;Help me in what way?&quot; he inquired carefully as
he slipped his gauntlet back on and absently locked it into place.
     &quot;Beauty may only be skin-deep,&quot; she said lightly, giving him a coy look,
&quot;But you would still be utterly amazed at what can be done with it.  Come, she
should not be busy at this hour,&quot; she added as she took hold of his armored
wrist and started to lead him towards the door.
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled as he gently tugged himself free from her
grasp and started to follow her.  He soon became all but lost in a seemingly
endless maze of corridors and intersections as they traversed what felt like
the full length of the Hospitality division annex in the Imperial Castle.  All
he saw were doors and the occasional attendant in a white robe, most pausing
only long enough to nod their heads at Zan&#39;zemet as they went about their
business in a distinctly casual and relaxed manner.
     They finally stopped in front of a non-descript metal door that seemed to
be like the countless others they had just passed.  A small panel was off to
one side with a small placard that simply read &#39;AW-21&#39;.  &quot;Here we are,&quot; the
brigadier said as she entered a short sequence of taps on the panel, causing
the door to quietly hiss open.  Inside was a small studio of sorts, apparently
one for graphic arts, with a lone figure hunched over something on the table
set into the back wall.  She cast a quick glance over her shoulder at the sound
of the door being opened, seeming to give Zan&#39;zemet a cool look before turning
back to whatever it was she was working on.
     &quot;Lin,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said in a moderate tone as she stepped inside and made a
gesture to Ar&#39;kanis to follow her.  The door hissed shut as he did so, coming
rather close to pinching his wings in the process and causing him to cast a
leery glance at the tiny sensor set into the door frame.
     &quot;I don&#39;t suppose this can wait?&quot; the other woman said gruffly without
turning around.
     &quot;I have a gift for you,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied, causing Ar&#39;kanis to blink hard
and the other woman to turn just enough to cast a sidelong glance at her.
     &quot;Do you now?&quot; she said in an openly wary tone.
     &quot;Lin, this is General Ar&#39;kanis of the Imperial Red Wings,&quot; the brigadier
said as she took a half-step to the side, gesturing to the armored general.
     &quot;Okay, and?&quot; the woman prompted, turning around to give them both a look
that suggested she wasn&#39;t overly happy with the intrusion.
     Zan&#39;zemet suppressed the urge to roll her eyes as she turned to Ar&#39;kanis.
&quot;This is Lin-Ral.  She is a civilian associate here, so there isn&#39;t a whole lot
I can do about her attitude,&quot; she explained dryly.  &quot;However, I do value her
skills rather highly.  Enough so that I&#39;m willing to overlook her sharp tongue
at times, just as long as she doesn&#39;t cross the line,&quot; she added, raising her
voice slightly as it took on a faint edge.
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly, not quite sure what to make of the
seemingly youthful woman.  Her hair was carelessly pinned back in a loose coil
of dark brown, more to keep it out of her way than to try to accent any of her
casual beauty.
     &quot;So what can I do for you, Zan?&quot; Lin-Ral inquired warily.
     &quot;Would you be so kind as to show her your arm?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said lightly to
Ar&#39;kanis, taking several steps back so as not to obstruct anyone&#39;s view.
     Ar&#39;kanis cast a faintly uneasy look at her before turning to look at the
young girl.  He sighed at the look of open impatience on her face and reached
over to unlock his gauntlet again, deftly slipping it off before holding his
hand up to the somewhat dim light of the room.
     Lin-Ral&#39;s eyes nearly popped out of her head as she bolted to her feet, a
sheaf of papers on her desk scattering to the floor with a near-silent whoosh.
&quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi!&quot; she hissed in shock as she stared at his hand.
     Ar&#39;kanis sighed again as he looked down at his hand, able to clearly see
the bones through the perfectly transparent flesh.  His muscles and tendons
were likewise just as transparent, seeming to be little more than a gelatinous
mass that rippled slightly when flexed.  Even his blood vessels were all but
invisible unless one looked closely enough, barely more than ghostly lines that
carried his equally colorless blood throughout his body.
     &quot;Look closely, Lin,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet instructed quietly.  &quot;His skin is intact
and in perfect health.  It is only color that it lacks.&quot;
     &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; Lin-Ral repeated in a muted whisper as she carefully
approached Ar&#39;kanis, one trembling hand reaching out to hesitantly touch him.
She blinked hard as she indeed felt skin beneath her fingertips despite what
her eyes were telling her, causing her to look up at him in amazement.  &quot;What
happened to you?&quot;
     &quot;A legacy of the Chaos Factor,&quot; he rumbled in an unusually quiet tone.
     &quot;Lin,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet spoke up, causing both Lin-Ral and Ar&#39;kanis to look at
her.  &quot;Your time is precious, or so you keep telling me, so I will keep this
short before taking my leave.  You spoke to me several times about how you felt
your artistic skills weren&#39;t being properly utilized, and how you had been
studying a unique form of artistry involving dyes injected into the skin.&quot;
     &quot;Tattoos,&quot; Lin-Ral immediately spoke up, her eyes widening.  &quot;Zan, are you
serious?&quot;
     &quot;His skin is like yours or mine,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied calmly, &quot;Save that it
lacks color.  I believe the two of you can help one another, as you can give
his skin the coloring that he needs, and in turn he can give you something to
do for however long the process takes.  You always said you wanted a blank
canvas to work on,&quot; she added with a faint smile.  &quot;I believe I have just found
him for you.  If he is willing, of course,&quot; she said as she cast a questioning
look at Ar&#39;kanis.
     &quot;I am not sure I understand,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied in an uneasy tone.
     &quot;I will let Lin explain it to you,&quot; the brigadier replied, &quot;As she is far
more knowledgeable about the process than I am.  And if I am completely wrong
about this situation, which I will not hesitate to admit has happened before,
then she can be the one to tend to you in your bath if absolutely nothing else.
She is still obligated to do that much for me on occasion,&quot; she added, giving
Lin-Ral a measured look.
     &quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Lin-Ral replied dismissively as she continued to study
his hand intently, a look of wonder still in her dark eyes.  &quot;You know, she
just might be right,&quot; she said softly as she looked up at Ar&#39;kanis&#39; helmet.
She blinked and tried to peer inside for a few moments before wrinkling her
nose in slight distaste.  &quot;C&#39;mon, I want to put you under my scanner for a few
moments, I want to make sure that this&#39;ll work before I even think about mixing
up the inks and breaking out the needles.&quot;
     &quot;Needles?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired in a dangerously calm tone.
     &quot;Lin....&quot; Zan&#39;zemet tried to say.
     &quot;Look, make up your mind,&quot; Lin-Ral sighed as she cast an irritated glance
towards the other woman.  &quot;If you want me to work on this, then go away and let
me get to work.  And believe me, if this turns out to be what I think it will,
this is going to be my greatest work ever.&quot;
     &quot;He has places to be later tonight,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet pointed out.
     &quot;Look, this isn&#39;t something that can be done in an hour,&quot; Lin-Ral shot
back.  &quot;Hell, I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ll be able to do a demo-inking today.  Trust
me, if he needs to be washed and waxed or whatever, I&#39;ll take care of it.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet just shook her head slowly.  &quot;If you need anything, Ar&#39;kanis,
you have but to ask any attendant to page me,&quot; she said as she made her way
over to the door.  &quot;And if you have any problems with Lin here, feel free to
smack her around.  I won&#39;t say anything to Security or Admiral Si&#39;ren.&quot;
     &quot;As you command,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a perfectly neutral tone.
     &quot;Just get out of my studio and let me work,&quot; Lin-Ral sighed.  She waited
for the door to open and close behind Zan&#39;zemet before taking a step back to
look at Ar&#39;kanis with a critical eye.  &quot;Okay, let&#39;s start this from the top and
do it the right way first.  Your entire body is this transparent, right?&quot;
     &quot;All but my wings,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied.
     &quot;Lose the helmet, please,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;You sound like you&#39;ve got a nice
voice, but that metallic echo is getting on my nerves.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis raised an eyebrow at her tone.  &quot;I would not be so eager to have
me do that if I were you,&quot; he warned.
     &quot;Let me guess,&quot; she suggested as she sat back down on her stool and leaned
her elbows back against the desk behind her.  &quot;Your face is likewise just as
see-through, so it&#39;ll be like looking at Death head-on, am I right?&quot;
     Her seemingly fearless and cavalier attitude was more than enough to make
him pause for several moments.  &quot;There is more to it than that,&quot; he pointed out
carefully.  &quot;The Chief Medical Officer aboard the V&#39;ral seems to think that I
have what he calls &#39;a presence&#39; that is only discernible when I am unmasked.
I should like to warn you now, whatever you felt when you saw my hand will be
trivial in comparison if you are either brave enough or foolish enough to try
to look me in the eye.&quot;
     Lin-Ral leaned back harder against the desk, one eyebrow arching up at the
ominous tone to his words.  &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; she said after a moment.  &quot;Well, let me
put it to you like this.  Before I came to work here at the Castle, I spent a
few years in a morgue helping reconstruct faces so that a given corpse could be
properly viewed during funeral services or crystal entombment.  Believe me when
I say I&#39;ve seen some real stomach-churners before.&quot;
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t make me feel any better,&quot; he pointed out darkly.
     &quot;I&#39;m not comforted by it either,&quot; she retorted.  &quot;I&#39;m just telling you why
I&#39;m not all that worried about it.  Just take your helmet off, I won&#39;t laugh or
anything stupid like that.&quot;
     &quot;Indeed you won&#39;t,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a cold voice as he reached up and got
a firm hold on his helmet.  He hesitated slightly out of pure reflex, not being
used to unmasking himself in the presence of anyone other than his visually-
impaired squire aboard the V&#39;ral.  A simple glance at the look on her face was
enough to remind him of her attitude, causing him to mentally shrug before
breaking the joint seals and lifting his helmet off.
     Her reaction was virtually identical to Nop&#39;tera&#39;s so long ago, a brief
look of pure horror crossing her face as her eyes widened uncontrollably.  She
then averted her eyes, her skin turning a sickly shade of white and her breath
almost visibly catching in her throat.  &quot;By the NegaForce....&quot; she hissed in a
soft, almost broken whisper.
     &quot;I warned you,&quot; he said simply in an impassionate tone, feeling his soul
darken yet again.  He paused as she visibly rallied herself, taking a deep
breath and narrowing her eyes before looking squarely at him.  It was easy to
see that his unmasked visage was having a dramatic effect on her, causing her
face to lose even more color as she fought an internal battle against whatever
impulses of fear and terror were tearing at her mind and soul.
     &quot;Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she whispered through trembling lips.  &quot;Ar&#39;kanis il&#39; Ha&#39;ver.&quot;
     &quot;Some have said that,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied calmly as he moved to put his
helmet back on.
     &quot;Wait, don&#39;t,&quot; she suddenly blurted out, still obviously fighting to keep
control.  &quot;Just.... close your eyes for a moment.  Yes, yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; she
breathed with open relief as he complied.  &quot;Your physician was right, it is a
projected effect.  Wait right here, I&#39;ve got an idea,&quot; she said quickly as she
stood up and darted out of the room.
     He waited until he heard the door closing behind her before opening his
eyes, casting an uncertain glance around the room.  It bothered him greatly to
realize that it had simply never occurred to him to try to experiment with his
&#39;presence&#39; as the Chief Medical Officer termed it.  For physical exams, he only
exposed what parts of his body that needed to be examined in detail, and it was
a very rare event for him to be asked to remove his helmet for any such exam.
His vision and hearing were perfectly normal, and he seemed to be immune to
common respiratory ailments.  He had even managed to avoid acquiring that truly
nasty headcold that came around during the insurgency of Vul Rein, the one that
had even General Nop&#39;tera hating life with a passion....
     He shook his head hard to himself, not so much to dispel the sudden surge
of memories as to refocus himself on his mission.  He was here to meet with
Admiral Si&#39;ren and try to negotiate peace with her, not sit in some dim studio
in a NegaForce-only-knows part of the Hospitality division annex.  And he most
certainly wasn&#39;t here to expose himself to anyone, least of all a civilian....
     The sound of the door opening behind him caused him to freeze, resisting
the urge to turn around and look behind him.  It hissed shut a moment later as
Lin-Ral returned, quickly crossing the distance to stand in front of him.
     &quot;Hold still,&quot; she instructed as she reached up to him, slipping a pair of
goggles over his head.  She then moved to sit down on her stool, holding some
sort of remote device in her hand.  She paused and took a deep breath before
turning to face him, reflexively cringing once again as she looked into his
eyes.  &quot;Now the acid test....&quot; she whispered as she pressed a button on the
device.
     He blinked hard as the world was suddenly tinted a bright shade of blue,
a result of the lenses in the goggles taking in the vibrant coloring.  Much to
his surprise he then heard a heavy sigh of relief, glancing up at her face to
see that she was indeed able to relax.
     &quot;Oh, much better,&quot; she breathed.  She paused for a moment before making a
gesture with the remote unit.  &quot;Variable-filter goggles,&quot; she said by way of
explanation.  &quot;I can still feel a distinct chill, mind you, but the worst of it
seems to be blocked by the light filter.  You can still see, right?&quot;
     &quot;With some difficulty,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis admitted as he looked around the room.
He blinked as he heard a soft noise from her, one that definitely wasn&#39;t one of
fear or revulsion.  A quick glance back at her cause him to raise his eyebrows,
or at least the bony ridges that served as his eyebrows.
     &quot;See, I was right about your voice,&quot; she pointed out.  &quot;Keep talking for
a moment, I want to listen to it.&quot;
     &quot;What sort of optical device is this?&quot; he inquired as he carefully reached
up to probe the goggles.  They seemed to be little more than standard-sized
safety goggles, but obviously with some kind of polarizing hardware to tint the
lenses as desired.
     &quot;Like I said, variable-filter goggles.  Here,&quot; she said as she leaned
forward and held the device out to him.  &quot;If you can&#39;t see right, go ahead and
play with the settings until you can.  I&#39;ll let you know if your &#39;presence&#39; is
dialed up too high,&quot; she added with a distinctly ironic smirk.
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; he said as he studied the control.  It was a fairly simple
and straightforward device, and it only took him a few moments to dampen the
brightness of the blue filters to the point where he could look around the room
without cringing slightly at the intensity of the glow.
     &quot;Oooh,&quot; Lin-Ral said as she shivered faintly.  &quot;Try another setting.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis thought about it for a moment before he adjusted the amount of
red coloring to the lenses, darkening the tint to a deep shade of purple that
wasn&#39;t bright enough to interfere with his vision.  &quot;How&#39;s this?&quot; he said as he
cautiously looked up at her.
     &quot;Perfect,&quot; she said in a low tone, narrowing her eyes slightly.  &quot;I can
still see your eyes, kinda sorta, but I&#39;m hardly feeling that icy hand around
my heart.  Well, not too much,&quot; she amended after a moment.  &quot;But I can cope.
Amazing,&quot; she said as she studied his face and head.
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; he echoed quietly as he looked around the room carefully, more
than a little surprised at how well the situation was going given the fact that
he was completely unmasked.  &quot;If nothing else,&quot; he added a moment later as he
began to think aloud, &quot;This alone might have made my visit to the Imperial
Castle worthwhile.&quot;
     &quot;What do you mean?&quot; she inquired carefully as she sat back, her gaze still
firmly fixed on his skull.  The bones were the only feature that could be seen
with any ease, making it appear that he was little more than a fairly hefty
skeleton in a suit of armor.  His eyes were dark and somewhat indistinct orbs,
not easily discernible from his eye sockets unless seen from a side angle.  The
rest of his flesh was all but invisible unless she looked very closely for the
very minute variations in tint to the otherwise colorless mass that surrounded
his bones, seeming to be all that was holding both them and him together.
     &quot;I have never tried to do anything about this &#39;presence&#39; effect before,&quot;
he admitted quietly as he returned his focus to her.  &quot;And I am more than a
little ashamed to realize that part of it could have been mitigated with the
addition of a simple pair of goggles.  Such a thing might have served to make
my life significantly easier at times when it otherwise failed to be.&quot;
     Lin-Ral made a dismissive shrugging gesture.  &quot;All feel-good language in
the Hospitality charter aside, we really are here to help others,&quot; she pointed
out.  &quot;Granted I&#39;m not what you would call a people-person, and Zan&#39;zemet knows
she can kiss my ptanka if she honestly thinks I&#39;ll ever agree to put a smile on
someone&#39;s face like those bath sluts do with genuine eagerness, but like she
said, I do have a few uses around here.  Speaking of which, come over here for
a few minutes so I can let the scanner get a good look at your skin,&quot; she said
as she stood up and moved over to a small console set into the wall.
     A few taps on the keypad resulted in the wall seeming to split apart into
several sections, unfolding and rolling back until it was reformed into a half-
circle shape.  A glowing pattern was projected on the floor, depicting the area
that the sensors would be able to scan without any major design changes.
     &quot;And what will this do?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired warily.
     Lin-Ral shrugged again.  &quot;Not much,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;I really only use it
to map three-dimensional objects for planning my artwork, but it does have a
few medical-based sensors to let me know if there are any health issues I need
to be aware of.  It&#39;ll pick up on skin allergens, too, so I know what inks to
avoid.  Oh, by the way, you might as well ditch the armor since I&#39;m pretty sure
the metal will interfere with a few of the readings.  You.... do have something
on under all that, right?&quot; she added as a slightly awkward afterthought.
     &quot;And if I don&#39;t?&quot; he replied calmly.
     She looked at him for a moment and shrugged once more.  &quot;I doubt it&#39;d be
anything I haven&#39;t seen before.  Not that it&#39;ll be a concern if this goes the
way I think it will, but one step at a time.  Or do I need to find a portable
gravity-shield to help you with the weight of your armor?&quot; she prodded.
     &quot;That will not be necessary,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said as knelt down and set his
helmet on the ground.  He then began to methodically disassemble his suit of
armor, laying each piece aside in a process that he probably could have done in
his sleep.  It became obvious after a few moments that he was indeed wearing an
undersuit of some sort, though one designed more for padding certain key joints
against the metal of his armor than preserving his modesty.  That task was done
by a pair of boxer-like shorts that helped keep everything where it should be
without undue chafing or exposure.
     &quot;And that all weighs how much?&quot; Lin-Ral spoke up once he had stepped out
of the armored frames that served as boots.
     &quot;Enough to test the shock-absorbers on my tank,&quot; he replied with a faint
note of amusement.
     &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; she protested as she glanced up at him.  &quot;You also drive
around in a tank wearing all that armor?&quot;
     &quot;I do,&quot; he replied with a nod.  &quot;In fact, I am glad you said something.
My battalion should still be anchored on the south parade field, and if all of
the radiation has indeed been dispersed as our sensors would have us believe,
I may be able to recover it and take it back to the V&#39;ral when I return.&quot;
     She snorted quietly to herself.  &quot;A little paranoid about being safe and
protected, aren&#39;t we?  I&#39;ll bet you even wrap your k&#39;vesan in three condoms to
be sure before bedding someone,&quot; she muttered.
     Ar&#39;kanis paused and gave her a distinctly unamused look, absently flexing
his wings behind him.  &quot;I see what Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet said about your sharp
tongue,&quot; he said in a neutral tone.  &quot;In any case, unless you are interested in
finding out for yourself, I would strongly suggest you not waste your time or
mine with idle speculations on how I go about dealing with personal affairs.&quot;
     She gave him a smirk for a few seconds before her mood seemed to fade as
she got a good look at him.  &quot;Anyway, I see why the armor isn&#39;t too much of a
problem for you,&quot; she said as she studied the impressive amount of muscle mass
he seemed to have.  She paused as she regarded his wings carefully, tilting her
head slightly before making a gesture to him.  &quot;Hold still, I want to get a
good look at your back for a few.&quot;
     He remained silent as she slowly circled him, absently flexing his wings
now that the muscles were no longer constrained by his armor.  He felt a very
light touch on his arm after a few moments, slowly tracing the curve of his
shoulder before migrating across his back and down to the large knots where his
wings were anchored to the bony protrusions sprouting from his spine.
     &quot;You know, this just might work after all,&quot; she spoke up in a tone that
was best described as subdued awe.  &quot;I&#39;d have to completely map your skin out
in its entirety and do some serious contour-designing, but I think the software
can handle that.  And with your wings?&quot; she added as she very carefully stroked
the thick base where the dark olive coloring of his wings faded away to blend
in with the rest of his transparent skin.  &quot;I even have a few ideas of what
pattern to be using.&quot;
     &quot;If I may,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis spoke up in a wary tone, &quot;You have yet to explain to
me what it is that you plan on doing.  You have spoken of inks and needles,
which I must admit I do not find very comforting without further information.&quot;
     &quot;You know what a tattoo is?&quot; she asked, still gazing intently at the base
of his wings.
     &quot;The word is unknown to me,&quot; he admitted calmly.
     She paused and glanced up at him, wrinkling her nose slightly as she only
encountered the back of his skull.  &quot;The process is simple.  You take a needle,
fill it with an indelible ink, and inject a tiny drop beneath the skin.  Move
the needle over slightly, inject another drop, repeat to form a pattern.  Use
different dyes for different colors, and you have a permanent mark on the body.
Like this,&quot; she said as she pushed her left sleeve up almost to her shoulder
and held her arm out.
     Ar&#39;kanis turned around and blinked at the sight of the delicate flower in
full bloom imprinted on her skin.  &quot;A permanent inking?&quot; he echoed, giving her
a slightly startled look.  &quot;It does not wash off or become absorbed by the body
with time?&quot;
     &quot;It can be removed if you want,&quot; she replied with a half-shrug.  &quot;You&#39;ll
need a laser to do it, of course, since you&#39;ll have to break up the ink drops
in the skin, but still.  I inked this a century ago,&quot; she added as she flexed
her arm slightly.  &quot;Not many denizens care for the idea of permanent markings
on their bodies, and I know that military personnel are strongly discouraged
from having such things, but it isn&#39;t expressly forbidden.  Zan&#39;zemet made sure
to research that one quite thoroughly when the question first came up,&quot; she
added absently.
     She paused and raised an eyebrow at him as he very carefully reached out
to touch her, lightly brushing a fingertip over the tattoo of the kath blossom
she had inked as a proof-of-concept experiment.  &quot;It&#39;s underneath the skin, so
you won&#39;t feel anything,&quot; she explained carefully.  &quot;Granted you&#39;ll be feeling
it and then some when it gets put on, and it will scab over for a week or two
as the skin heals, but once it&#39;s done healing that&#39;s it.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; he murmured as he lowered his hand and edged back slightly,
giving her a faintly uneasy look.  &quot;And this is what you wish to do to me?&quot;
     She nodded as she tugged her sleeve back down, looking into his goggled
eyes and feeling a faint shiver run through her.  &quot;Here&#39;s what I&#39;m thinking,&quot;
she said carefully.  &quot;I&#39;ll have to scan you to make absolutely sure of this, of
course, but if the only problem with your skin is the lack of color, I can give
it some by using injected inks.  The ink stays beneath the skin and won&#39;t fade
with time or anything, so it&#39;ll be a permanent look for you.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting concept,&quot; he mused as he glanced down at his hands, flexing
them slightly.  He blinked as she reached out to grab his arm in a gentle but
firm grip, all but dragging him across the room towards the sensor unit she had
unfolded from the wall earlier.
     &quot;Talk while I scan you,&quot; she grumbled with impatience as she let go of his
arm and made a gesture.  &quot;Stand inside the ring on the ground and let me know
if I need to widen the scope of the scan to get everything.  Wait, I think I&#39;m
getting ahead of myself here,&quot; she amended with a sigh.  She cast a critical
eye at his padded undersuit before shaking her head to herself in resignation.
&quot;Yeah, one thing at a time.  Just stand under the light and hold still, I need
to examine your skin first to make sure this isn&#39;t just an exercise in wishful
thinking.&quot;
     &quot;As you command,&quot; he rumbled with mild amusement as he stepped into the
half-circle shape.  He drew his wings inward and turned around, trying to keep
his bulk inside the rather smallish ring of red light being projected on the
ground by the overhead sensor array.
     Lin-Ral just rolled her eyes.  &quot;You military types are like robots some
days, you know that?&quot; she observed as she went over to the control panel and
began to type a series of instructions into it.  &quot;Just hold still for a few
moments, this won&#39;t take long and you won&#39;t feel a thing.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis remained silent as a series of lights began to play around his
body, seeming to be coming from both the overhead unit and a series of sensors
imbedded in the back half of the curved wall.  He blinked as he heard a servo
start up, very slowly rotating the back wall around to pass in front of him and
allow the sensors to study his front half in detail as well.
     &quot;Yes, I was right,&quot; Lin-Ral cooed to herself with a small smile.  &quot;Your
skin is indeed just fine, lack of coloring aside, and it doesn&#39;t appear to be
sensitive to any of the usual dyes and inks.  Think you could stand still for
about five minutes while I map your skin contours in detail?&quot; she inquired.
     &quot;If you wish,&quot; he replied calmly.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; she said as she moved over to her stool and dragged it back
over to the wall console.  She then sat down and called up a very specialized
variation of a three-dimensional terrain mapping program, one suited to tracing
the subtlest outlines of a given body.  &quot;Go ahead and get undressed, and I&#39;ll
start the program when you&#39;re ready.&quot;
     &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis spoke up with an almost audible blink.
     &quot;Look,&quot; she sighed as she pivoted on the chair to look at him.  &quot;Here&#39;s
how this whole project is going to work.  I first need to make a very detailed
map of the shape of your body, and when I say detailed I mean down to the size,
shape, depth, and location of each and every pore in your body.  I can&#39;t do
that if you&#39;re wearing something.&quot;
     &quot;And once you have that information?&quot; he prodded warily.
     &quot;Then I load your virtual body into an imager and design your skin,&quot; she
replied patiently.  &quot;You and I will then go over it, discuss how it looks and
what sort of changes you would like, then once we&#39;re absolutely certain we have
the look you want I mix up the inks and break out the needles.  That last step
is liable to take months, by the way,&quot; she added.
     &quot;Months?&quot; he echoed.
     She sighed and crossed her arms over her shapely chest.  &quot;Yes, months,&quot;
she repeated.  &quot;I can&#39;t work on too large of a section at a time, and you need
to heal between steps.  Granted I can rotate between various parts of your body
so there isn&#39;t any downtime in a sense, but stop and think just how much skin
you have.  And when I say I&#39;ll be tattooing everything, I mean *everything*.
Between your fingers and toes, eyelids, around your nose, inside your navel,
inside your ear, your k&#39;vesan will have to be tattooed as well....&quot;
     &quot;You must be joking,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a somewhat flat tone.
     &quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; she replied firmly.  &quot;If it is colorless skin, it goes under
the needle to get color.  I&#39;ll be honest, Zan&#39;zemet was right.... you are a
gift.  I&#39;ve been wanting to do a full-body design for someone for quite awhile
now, and you seem to be a prime candidate for that.  Yes, this will take quite
a lot of time and will hurt like hell, but stop and think for a moment, okay?&quot;
     He blinked as she hopped off of the stool and approached him, giving him
a somber look that left him with the impression that she was being absolutely
sincere with him.  &quot;We both get something out of this.  You get to have a new
life without people looking at you and cringing, and I.... I get to have a use
for once, an honest and genuinely helpful application for my artistry,&quot; she
said, her voice dropping in volume as she spoke.
     &quot;Be that as it may,&quot; he rumbled in a guarded tone, &quot;I doubt I can spare
several months for such an endeavor.  I am a general of the Imperial Red Wings
and a commander of an airborne carrier-based tank division.  I have duties to
perform and soldiers to look after, neither of which permits a great deal of
&#39;personal time&#39; in which to see something like this done.&quot;
     &quot;So we do this at a measured pace,&quot; she countered with a shrug.  &quot;A little
bit each day.  Surely they don&#39;t have you working all the time with only a few
minutes allocated to eating or using the bathroom.&quot;
     &quot;Assuredly not,&quot; he replied.  &quot;However, I will most likely not be able to
make regular and routine visits to the Imperial Castle when such time becomes
available.  As I said, I serve aboard an airborne carrier, and like sea-based
carriers we do not spend the majority of our time docked to an installation.
Unless you were to be aboard the V&#39;ral with me, I don&#39;t see how this endeavor
would work out with any reliability.&quot;
     &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll think about it,&quot; Lin-Ral said without hesitation, causing
him to blink hard.
     &quot;Excuse me?&quot; he rumbled.
     &quot;Going back with you to your carrier,&quot; she explained with a shrug.  &quot;It
won&#39;t be the first time a Navy ship has taken aboard a civilian or three as
supercargo for a deployment.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re serious,&quot; he stated as his blood briefly chilled at the thought.
     &quot;Look,&quot; she sighed, giving him an unsettled look.  &quot;We can discuss this
later if you want.  Am I willing to say yes right this moment?  Absolutely not,
I&#39;d have to really think about this one.  I don&#39;t have anything tying me down
here in terms of obligations, aside from what Zan&#39;zemet has me doing here, and
getting out to see the planet doesn&#39;t sound like all that bad of an idea.  And
like I said, I&#39;ve been waiting for an opportunity like this for awhile now, so
if I have to do a little travelling to make it happen, I can handle that.  But
first thing&#39;s first, I need to map your skin properly so I know what I have to
work with when I go to plan out the pattern.  Think you could handle looking
like you have scales?&quot; she said as she sat back with a faint smile.
     &quot;Scales?&quot; he echoed carefully, giving her a slightly intrigued look.
     &quot;Why not?&quot; she replied.  &quot;I&#39;ll be honest, I find single-color skin tones
to be.... well, boring,&quot; she said as she pushed both sleeves back and crossed
her arms at the wrists for comparison.  &quot;Look at my skin, for example.  No real
color, no contrast, nothing stands out at a distance.  I once thought of trying
to ink a pattern on my arms, sort of like the color bands that some Felinoids
have, but Zan&#39;zemet said it would be a distraction to others who were focused
more on relaxation or something.&quot;
     &quot;And the tattoo on your arm?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired lightly as he was able to
glimpse the very bottom edge of it beneath her rolled-up sleeve.
     Lin-Ral paused for a moment before moving to push the sleeve up higher so
that it was readily visible.  &quot;Like I said, a proof-of-concept experiment that
she let me have since it&#39;s not immediately visible.  I actually have a second
one that she doesn&#39;t know about, but it&#39;s on my thigh and I&#39;ll be damned if I&#39;m
going to strip just to show you.  So back to the original topic,&quot; she grumbled
as she absently tugged her sleeve back down a few inches.
     &quot;About subjecting me to a procedure that sounds suspiciously like torture
in order to make me look like a lizard?&quot; he said with an open note of humor.
     &quot;Truthfully?&quot; she replied, her tone making him blink.  &quot;I was thinking
more like a cross between a ter&#39;aka and an oratu.  Armored scales, or at least
the appearance of them, just on a smaller.... er, scale,&quot; she said, a delicate
blue blush tinting her cheeks at the accidental pun.  &quot;Small scales, each one
about the size of your thumbnail and overlapping one another.  I was thinking
a dark shade of green for the primary color, though that mostly is intended to
help match the color of your wings so you don&#39;t really clash.&quot;
     &quot;Go on,&quot; he prodded as he cast a glance behind him as best he could, one
wing stretching out to enter his field of vision.
     &quot;From a technical standpoint, it&#39;d be perfect,&quot; she continued, her voice
taking on a measure of restrained excitement the more she thought about it.
&quot;A pattern like that would be fairly easy to model on a grid that would then be
mapped to your body&#39;s contours.  Inking the actual artwork would be a pain in
the ptanka, figuratively for me as well as literally for you, but like I said,
I&#39;ve been wanting to do a detailed project like this for decades.  And since
each individual scale would be a discreet task, any artistic mistakes made in
the inking process would be confined to that lone scale.  I could even make a
few &#39;broken&#39; scales for you to accent scars if you like, or I could try to make
a given scar.... umm, become invisible,&quot; she said, faltering slightly at her
choice of words.
     &quot;Please continue,&quot; he urged her gently, giving her a very studious look
even as the possibilities began to swirl around in his mind.
     &quot;Well....&quot; she hedged before a new thought occurred to her.  &quot;Zan said you
were a general, right?  Sounds to me like you&#39;re used to standing out among
others, especially if you&#39;re wearing all that armor on a constant basis.  So if
you want to keep that.... presence,&quot; she said carefully, deliberately using the
same word he had used earlier, &quot;Why not have the best of both worlds?  You keep
your armor with you all the time, only wearing it literally beneath your skin,
and the uniqueness of it all guarantees that *nobody* will be able to mistake
you for anyone else, even at a distance.  And speaking of keeping that presence
around you..... what if the ink on your head was a dual-state dye?&quot;
     &quot;I beg your pardon?&quot; he asked warily as her attention suddenly started to
drift off into space.
     &quot;I&#39;m thinking,&quot; she said absently as she chewed on the edge of her lip.
     &quot;Try not to think too far ahead, if you please,&quot; he suggested dryly.  &quot;It
seems that long-range planning may not be one of your stronger skills.&quot;
     She blinked and suddenly refocused, giving him a distinctly dark look as
she glanced over at him.  &quot;You&#39;re starting to sound like Zan&#39;zemet,&quot; she said
in a somewhat flat tone.  &quot;I&#39;m trying to help you here, you know.&quot;
     &quot;No doubt that you are,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis allowed with a faint smile, &quot;But you
yourself have said that you seek to do this for your own purposes.  While I do
not have any problems with that in of itself, as we both will benefit from such
an endeavor, I would prefer that there not be any illusions as to motives.&quot;
     &quot;Alright, then,&quot; she replied in a faintly cool tone.  &quot;I can sleep soundly
at night with that premise in mind.  So then, let&#39;s get back to work, shall we?
I&#39;ll start drawing up the draft patterns while you finish getting undressed so
that the imagers can scan everything in sufficient detail.&quot;
     &quot;Humor me for a moment,&quot; he rumbled in a somewhat uneasy tone as he cast
a quick glance at the wall unit.  &quot;Must you examine.... everything with such a
minute focus?&quot;
     Lin-Ral sighed quietly and looked up at the ceiling.  &quot;Look,&quot; she said in
a somewhat testy voice.  &quot;If I don&#39;t image it with the precision scanners ahead
of time so I know what I have to work with, down to the smallest detail, then
I&#39;m not going to bother tattooing that section, which means it doesn&#39;t get any
color.  So unless you really want to continue waving a colorless k&#39;vesan around
for the rest of your life, I suggest you get undressed and stand under the red
circle of light.  Or are you getting all bent out of shape over the thought of
being naked with a woman in the room?&quot; she prodded, giving him a measured look.
&quot;If that&#39;s going to be a new experience for you, I can go ask....&quot;
     &quot;That will not be necessary, I assure you,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis interrupted in a calm
but distinctly icy tone.
     &quot;I was just checking,&quot; she replied with a knowing smirk.  She cast a quick
glance down at his undershorts before shrugging to herself.  &quot;Besides, not to
be offensive or anything, but I doubt I&#39;d be able to see anything anyway with
your body being that.... transparent isn&#39;t the right word, but you know what I
mean,&quot; she sighed.  &quot;Anyway,&quot; she added with another shrug before she sat back
down on the stool and turned her focus towards the wall console.
     He studied her for a moment before making the softest of sighing sounds to
himself, casting another studious glance at the wall scanner as his thoughts
returned to the small seed of hope that he was starting to believe was within
his grasp.  Surely a minor indignity such as undressing in her presence would
be almost trivial in comparison to what she suggested she would end up doing to
him in the visible future, right?  And if she really did intend to inject ink
into *every* part of his skin, obvious concerns about pain and tender anatomy
aside, then wouldn&#39;t he have to be essentially undressed for protracted periods
of time in her presence anyway?
     His hands were halfway to the fastenings of the padded undersuit when he
heard her voice once again.  &quot;Oh, umm, one more thing,&quot; she spoke up, her eyes
still focused on the display in front of her.  &quot;You&#39;ll need to take off the
goggles as well.  The electronics will interfere with the sensor readings.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; he replied quietly as he reached up and slipped the tinted
lenses off.  He paused and cast a glance in her direction as a thought occurred
to him, causing a small smile to form on his face.  He realized that if his
&#39;presence&#39; effect wasn&#39;t being suppressed, then it was unlikely that she would
try to look in his direction until everything was finished.  And even if she
did, a simple glance would be more than enough to convince her to look away....
     &quot;You know,&quot; she said slowly, ignoring the chill starting to creep into her
blood as her peripheral vision picked up on his movements, &quot;I&#39;m still thinking
about what I said earlier, about using a dual-state dye for your face and head.
What if.... and I&#39;m just thinking aloud here, mind you.... what if I could mix
a dye that was green in one energy state, but reverted to colorless when the
right kind of energy was applied?&quot;
     The thought was enough to halt him in mid-motion, still in the process of
removing the last part of the padded undersuit from his legs.  &quot;Then that part
of my skin would likewise remain colorless,&quot; he observed slowly.
     &quot;Yes, so what if you could use it like a masking effect?&quot; she said as she
glanced over at him without thinking about it.  She managed to avert her gaze
an instant later, but not before a bolt of pure horror was sent racing down her
spine to induce an icy tingle that ran from her fingertips down to her toes.
&quot;So imagine that you&#39;re dealing with someone you don&#39;t like, or need to scare
the living navidshi out of.  You just look them in the eye, trigger the change
in skin color.....&quot;
     &quot;And watch as they react to looking the Ar&#39;kanis il&#39; Ha&#39;ver in the face,&quot;
he murmured softly.  He continued to mull it over as he resumed his motions,
setting the padding aside and reaching for the elastic band of his undershorts.
&quot;It is an.... interesting concept, I have to admit, but one I am not sure would
be practical.  Should I be wearing goggles at the time....&quot;
     &quot;Why not tattoo your eyes as well?&quot; she suggested cautiously as she made
certain that the imaging program was ready.  &quot;Well, not literally, of course,
but I&#39;m fairly sure that someone in Medical can work with me on the concept.
Why not lay a reactive membrane over your corneas?  They remain dark purple or
whatever color you desire, one that will eliminate that fear-effect you seem to
have going pretty well, but can be tied to the same impulse signal that turns
them transparent when you trigger the skin-color change.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis mused as he stepped out of his undershorts and
absently set them aside.  He then paused and looked up at her, acutely aware of
his state of total undress.  &quot;I am ready,&quot; he said simply.
     &quot;So go stand over there,&quot; she suggested as she made a pointing gesture to
the wall unit.  She waited until he stepped inside the wide ring of red light
and turned around to face the room before hitting the commit button, sending a
slew of instructions to the computer interface.  &quot;Okay, just hold still, this
shouldn&#39;t take too long.&quot;
     He winced slightly as a series of small but extremely bright lights lit up
to cast a series of cross-shaped patterns across the front of his body.  The
hue darkened to a somewhat piercing shade of blue before the overhead servo
started up again, very slowly rotating the wall panel around him in a very wide
circle.  &quot;Must it be so bright?&quot; he spoke up in a fairly sour tone.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; she sighed, &quot;But it has to contrast your skin somehow.  The....
er, bright side is that it&#39;s only getting an overall highlight and won&#39;t last
much longer.  The rest of the work will be done by mapping lasers which won&#39;t
be nearly as hard on the eyes.&quot;
     &quot;Bright side indeed,&quot; he echoed in a fairly dry tone.  He blinked and cast
a startled glance over towards his armor as he heard the unmistakable sound of
a comm-link chittering for attention.  He was giving serious thought to simply
leaving the scanner to answer it when she stood up and made her way over to her
desk, pulling open a drawer with a distinctly unhappy look on her face.
     &quot;Typical,&quot; she muttered as the sound repeated itself, this time seeming to
be even louder than before.  She reached into the drawer and picked up a pair
of devices, the first being the flashing comm-link and the second being what
appeared to be a small pager unit, also with a flashing light.  She studied the
tiny display on the pager before flipping her thumb over the comm-link switch.
&quot;I&#39;m busy,&quot; she said tartly into the microphone.
     &lt;Be that as it may,&gt; the somewhat distorted voice said from the speaker,
&lt;Admiral Si&#39;ren has informed me that she has found some time in which to meet
with General Ar&#39;kanis before dinner.&gt;
     &quot;It&#39;ll have to wait, then, because he&#39;s busy,&quot; she said with a growl.
     &lt;How busy?&gt; the voice said with clear wariness.
     Lin-Ral glanced over at Ar&#39;kanis and promptly regretted it, having to stop
for a moment to visibly calm herself.  &quot;He&#39;s stark-naked right now and is being
scanned by my imaging program, which I&#39;m not going to interrupt for any reason
short of another nuclear disaster.  If someone is that eager to talk to him,
they can come down here and face the wall while they chit-chat so as not to be
bothered by the sight of his k&#39;vesan hanging out.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis felt his stomach tie itself into a knot and do a back-flip at the
way she had phrased things, idly wondering if it was possible for him to blush
and if anyone else would even be able to notice.  It was obvious that whomever
was on the other end of the comm-link was having a minor issue with the way
things had been phrased as well, as there had to have been almost a full thirty
seconds or so of pure silence from the speaker.
     &lt;And this will take how long?&gt; the distinctly tired voice finally replied.
     &quot;Call it thirty minutes,&quot; she replied with a casual shrug.  &quot;Have someone
put a smile on the admiral&#39;s face if you need to kill some time or otherwise
take her mind off of things, but he isn&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon.&quot;
     &lt;Very well,&gt; the speaker sighed.  &lt;Once you are finished scanning him and
he has made himself presentable again, please escort him to Conference Room Two
in the Imperial Castle.  Please do not delay him any longer than that, however,
as Admiral Si&#39;ren is not gifted with copious amounts of idle time.&gt;
     &quot;Right.  Out,&quot; Lin-Ral said as she thumbed the line closed and casually
tossed both the pager and the comm-link back into the drawer.  &quot;Ptanka,&quot; she
grumbled quietly beneath her breath.  She then glanced over at him again, her
eyes drawn by the movements of the sensor wall as it continued to rotate around
his body.
     A faint chill ran down his spine as their eyes met.  It was obvious that
his &#39;presence&#39; effect was not blunted in the slightest despite his state of
undress and being bathed in rays of almost blinding light, but for some reason
she seemed to be trying to fight the terror-inducing influence.  The struggle
was visible on her face as she continued to look at him, almost paralyzing her
body before she finally looked away and let her breath out as a ragged wheeze.
     &quot;Well, I&#39;ll say one thing,&quot; she finally spoke up, her tone wavering just
slightly as she tried to rally herself.  &quot;Working on you is going to be quite
the challenging experience.  And not just because of those eyes of yours.&quot;
     He raised an eyebrow at her, more than a little uncertain of what she was
trying to say.  &quot;How so?&quot; he prodded.  The dazzling nimbus of light around him
suddenly winked out, much to his immense relief, only to be replaced with a
literal shower of soft red laser lights that began to wander around his body at
seeming random.
     She paused to take in a deep breath before she looked back at him, her
body and blood once again becoming deathly chilled with irrational horror and
terror.  &quot;A....&quot; she started to say before closing her eyes, once again trying
to rally herself to the point of letting her speak and breathe normally.  &quot;Ask
me again later,&quot; she managed to say in a hoarse whisper before she gave up and
turned away, heading over to the wall console and sitting down on the stool.
     Interesting, he found himself thinking as he watched the lasers play over
his nude body.  The infusion of red light to his colorless skin made for a very
odd contrast, making it appear that he was composed of a dark red gelatin.  He
didn&#39;t care for the current look, but he knew that it was only temporary and
that the illusion would be dispelled when the lasers were switched off.  But if
what she said was both true and achieveable....
     Enough, he told himself firmly as he closed his eyes, mentally reaching
out to get a firm grip on the spark of hope that was burning inside his mind.
One step at a time, and there is much to be done first before I can think of
matters such as this.  Admiral Si&#39;ren is ready to talk now, and so that must be
my first.... indeed, my only priority, for without her consensus and agreement,
then I doubt either myself or Lin-Ral will live long enough to see her dream
become a reality.  Hers.... and perhaps my own as well....
     &quot;So far, so good,&quot; Lin-Ral said in a rather subdued voice, her gaze firmly
on the readings in front of her.  &quot;Just another few minutes to go.&quot;
     Indeed, he found himself thinking.  One step at a time, then....

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;So maybe putting that on the speaker was a mistake,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet admitted
with a faint blush as she very gingerly returned the comm-link to the drawer.
     Si&#39;ren just shook her head to herself, trying very hard not to let the
visual image haunt her any more than it already had.  &quot;Should I ask what she&#39;s
doing to him?&quot; she inquired in a very leery tone.  &quot;Or should I just leave it
alone and expect him to be in a pleasant mood shortly?&quot;
     The Hospitality mistress waved a hand in dismissal as she pressed a hidden
switch on the underside of her desk, silently engaging the heavy lock on her
office door.  A warning light outside was also lit up, letting everyone know
that now was not the time to be disturbing her in her office.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say
that he is being tended to in a very unique way by a very unique woman,&quot; she
said in a diplomatic tone.  &quot;Whether or not that will result in a pleasant mood
is up to the good general, but I don&#39;t expect him to be overly unruly.  Or at
least no more so than any flag officer in her Majesty&#39;s military,&quot; she added
with a note of distinct dryness.
     &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a noncommittal tone as she glanced over at the
office door.  She was fairly certain she had heard a very quiet noise a few
seconds ago, but it was hard to tell if it was indeed something or if she was
just hearing something truly innocuous like a momentary rattle in an air vent
from a change in temperature.
     &quot;Even you have to admit we&#39;ve had some real characters in this place, Si,&quot;
Zan&#39;zemet said gently.  &quot;Granted people like Jedyt and Malachite could be real
pains in the ptanka when they were in a mood, but they still tended to behave
themselves for hours at a time after a visit to my little domain,&quot; she chuckled
as she stood up.  She paused as she caught a glimpse of the look on Si&#39;ren&#39;s
face, fleeting as it was.  &quot;I take it you don&#39;t like being reminded of our
former and departed Commander-Generals?&quot; she prodded carefully.
     &quot;Would you?&quot; Si&#39;ren groused as she rubbed her sinuses.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said in a languid tone, immediately drawing a
very wary look from the admiral.  &quot;I didn&#39;t get to see Malachite in here very
often, but Jedyt was.... a frequent guest, or at least as far as visits from a
flag officer goes.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren continued to study her with extreme wariness, trying to decide if
she truly wanted to ask or not.  &quot;Not everyone sees people as you do,&quot; she said
in a somewhat arched tone.
     &quot;True,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet admitted.  &quot;However, none of my staff have ever reported
any.... what&#39;s a good term?... &#39;unnecessary roughness&#39; from Jedyt&#39;s visits.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren just shook her head to herself.  &quot;Depending on what he wanted, I
can see why he&#39;d want to behave himself,&quot; she muttered.  She paused as she felt
Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s hands on her back, very lightly smoothing out the wrinkles in her
dark blue uniform.  &quot;Zan, what are you doing?&quot; she inquired cautiously.
     A coy smile crossed the brigadier&#39;s face.  &quot;Crude as she can be at times,
my little artistic Lin often has valid points,&quot; she said in a faintly sultry
tone.  &quot;If your meeting with Ar&#39;kanis is to be delayed while she finishes up
her scans of him, then it only makes sense to keep you.... occupied....&quot;
     Si&#39;ren immediately tried to rise up from the stool, only to be gently and
firmly pushed back down by the pair of hands on her shoulders.  &quot;I don&#39;t have
time for this,&quot; she sighed quietly, already able to guess what Zan&#39;zemet was
thinking.
     &quot;I&#39;ve been hearing that a lot lately, Si,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet purred softly as she
lightly stroked Si&#39;ren&#39;s back.  &quot;No time for this, no time for that.  Yet oddly
enough, people still manage to find time to take care of certain things that
are important to them.  Consider the fact that until a few hours ago, we were
all but cut-off from the rest of the planet and had been for some time.  Yet
did the world come to an end because the outside couldn&#39;t talk to you?  Will
all be right with the Negaverse only as long as you are constantly watching out
for it?  Or can the world wait half an hour while you think of other things?&quot;
     &quot;Such as...?&quot; Si&#39;ren prompted in a quiet, almost sullen tone.
     &quot;Does it matter?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet murmured quietly as she leaned forward, her
hands slipping around Si&#39;ren&#39;s waist in a gentle embrace.  &quot;If the world can
handle you forgetting about it for half an hour, then why should it matter why
you are doing so?  Or are you going to tell me that you can&#39;t spare that sort
of time for a little rest and relaxation?  And don&#39;t try to tell me you don&#39;t
need both right now,&quot; she warned in a faintly reproving tone.  &quot;Lal told me
about the muscle kink she had to undo for you, and we both know what kind of
stress you have to be under for you to get those.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren snorted quietly to herself.  &quot;Someone went out of their way to make
sure that Rune and the rest of us got more than we bargained for yesterday,&quot;
she pointed out.  &quot;That alone is enough to stress anyone out, and more so when
you&#39;re in charge of cleaning up someone else&#39;s nuclear mess.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet made a quiet grunt deep in her throat.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you can
tell me what you know about that one?&quot; she inquired in a soft tone as her hands
began to gently work the fastenings of Si&#39;ren&#39;s tunic.  &quot;As I said to General
Ar&#39;kanis, I know little of the raw mechanics behind weapons of war save that
their wrath is so terrible as to almost be unimaginable.  Educate me, Si,&quot; she
breathed in a quiet, almost dulcet tone as she leaned forward to brush her lips
against the base of Si&#39;ren&#39;s neck.
     Si&#39;ren closed her eyes at the almost electric contact, not bothering to
resist as the front of her tunic was parted by Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s experienced touch.
&quot;In this case,&quot; she murmured, &quot;The missiles were stored in a silo complex in
the Northern Mountains.  Rune gave the order to spin up a pair of nuclear-
capable missiles, which means to fuel and prep the actual missile housing for
launch.  This takes a small measure of time, as the missiles are usually kept
inert so as not to result in any accidental firings.&quot;
     &quot;This was not an accident, then?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet asked softly as she stepped
back and slid Si&#39;ren&#39;s tunic off of her shoulders.
     Si&#39;ren shook her head as she focused on the wall opposite her, her mind&#39;s
eye turned inward to review what she knew of the weapons.  &quot;The launch was a
deliberate act,&quot; she said carefully.  &quot;Rune said the intent was for the V&#39;ral
to read the missile as being nuclear, which it was, and react appropriately.
What Rune emphasized in her orders, however, was that they were not to install
or otherwise arm the fusion trigger.  Without it, there wouldn&#39;t be the right
kind of force necessary to implode the core and create a nuclear explosion.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet was in the process of reaching for the bottom edge of Si&#39;ren&#39;s
undertunic when she froze in mid-motion, blinking hard at the realization of
what the admiral was implying.  &quot;Wait,&quot; she said slowly, casting a concerned
look up at Si&#39;ren before resuming her motions.  &quot;The warheads are part of the
missile housings and can&#39;t normally be removed, right?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren said nothing as she raised her arms up, allowing Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s hands
to slide her shirt up and over her head.  &quot;I&#39;m sure the warheads can be removed
if you disassemble the upper half of the missile,&quot; she said in a quiet voice.
&quot;However, that&#39;s intensive work and not done in a storage or launch facility.
There are access ports in each one, however, and those are primarily used to
fuel the missile and insert the firing mechanism before launch.&quot;
     &quot;I see,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said, setting the undertunic aside and running her
fingertips over Si&#39;ren&#39;s exposed back.  She reached up and undid the clasp of
Si&#39;ren&#39;s bra, brushing the webbing aside and slipping it off her shoulders.
She then began a slow and methodical series of strokes across Si&#39;ren&#39;s back,
using her fingertips to apply a rather moderate degree of pressure.  &quot;So what
are the odds of a missile going nuclear by accident with the fuse removed?&quot; she
inquired carefully.
     &quot;Flat zero,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she absently studied the bra that was in
her lap.  &quot;Oh, I suppose one of the ancient models with a gravity trigger could
go off if it landed just right and the brace gave way, but not with the fusion
warheads we have now.  No, Zan, the only reason this one went off in our laps
is because somebody wanted it to go off.  And for as much as I dislike the way
Rune does things sometimes, I really don&#39;t believe the detonation was her doing
and I don&#39;t see IR holding her directly responsible.  Not after she repeated
herself very clearly on the tape about not loading the fuse.&quot;
     &quot;A ruse, perhaps?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet suggested as she continued her massage.  The
tension in Si&#39;ren&#39;s back was quite apparent to her skilled touch, both the
muscles and tendons seeming to be cast out of flexible iron from sheer stress.
     &quot;That would be even worse,&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed quietly.  &quot;Instead of a &#39;mere&#39;
case of high treason, we now have high treason and conspiracy.  You&#39;re supposed
to make me feel better, Zan, not make me worry all the more.&quot;
     The softest of laughs rose up from the brigadier&#39;s chest as she began to
lean forward, putting more pressure into the massage.  &quot;You don&#39;t believe it,
though,&quot; she pointed out in a soft murmur.
     Si&#39;ren shook her head to herself.  &quot;No,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I think Rune was
telling the truth when she said all she intended to do was have the missile
read as nuclear instead of actually going off.  The risks would simply be too
great otherwise.  Which means we have a traitor somewhere in one of our nuclear
missile facilities, one with enough power or influence to make something like
this deliberately happen.&quot;
     &quot;Sure it can&#39;t be an accident?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet suggested.  &quot;Not with the raw
mechanics, mind you, but a simple case of denizen error?&quot;
     &quot;Zan, it takes a deliberate act to arm one of them,&quot; Si&#39;ren protested with
a very soft sigh as she closed her eyes.  She could feel the tension in her
back start to recede as Zan&#39;zemet continued to manipulate her muscles, cajoling
them into relaxing with a firm and steady touch.  &quot;A deliberate and physical
act.  You can&#39;t just pry open a hatch and flip a switch on a control panel, you
have to physically insert a circuit board and remove a trio of titanium-alloy
holding pins around the explosive triggers.  Nuclear weapons never go off by
accident, they can only go off by deliberate action and intent.&quot;
     &quot;And this procedure isn&#39;t practiced often?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet continued in a soft
tone, easing some of the pressure as she worked her hands higher up to focus on
Si&#39;ren&#39;s shoulders and the base of her neck.
     &quot;I&#39;m sure it is,&quot; the admiral murmured.  &quot;I know the Navy performs weapon
drills on a regular basis.  Or at least they are mandated to,&quot; she added with
a very faint chuckle.
     &quot;And that is done how?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet inquired gently as she continued to try
to relieve the tension and stress in Si&#39;ren&#39;s upper body.
     Si&#39;ren tilted her head to one side as Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s fingertips burrowed into
the muscles of her shoulder.  &quot;Mostly with mock-ups and inert hardware,&quot; she
said after a minor pause of thought and realization.  &quot;But now that I think
about it, they are permitted to train with the &#39;live&#39; hardware under certain
strict conditions.  Before you say anything, however,&quot; she added quickly before
Zan&#39;zemet could draw in a breath, &quot;You have to keep in mind that the procedures
governing nuclear weapons are quite literally the most rigid and stringent in
the entire military.  There are so many safeguards involved in such things that
it is almost inconceivable for a careless error to occur and not be noticed in
seconds, let alone to persist long enough to be involved in a launch.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet nodded to herself, knowing that Si&#39;ren wasn&#39;t making an idle
comment about the extreme level of rigid control associated with such weapons.
&quot;Be that as it may, Si, there is a saying,&quot; she murmured softly as she leaned
forward to gently brush her lips across a random spot on Si&#39;ren&#39;s back.  &quot;Do
not be so quick to attribute evil intentions to that which can adequately be
attributed to innocent incompetence.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren sighed quietly, more out of idle frustration than out of pleasure
at the somewhat intimate gesture.  &quot;That&#39;s just it, Zan, we don&#39;t let anyone
who isn&#39;t proven beyond all doubts to be competent near those weapons, and the
proficiency exams are both exacting and performed on a regular basis.  If this
was a case of incompetence, then I can see more than a few public executions
being scheduled in the immediate future.  If it goes up high enough in the
chain-of-command and a flag officer is deemed at fault, by law I will have to
wield the sword myself as we are without a Queen to either tend to it or name
a surrogate executioner in her place.&quot;
     &quot;Now there&#39;s a cheerful image,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet mused quietly as she moved her
hands to Si&#39;ren&#39;s other shoulder and started to give it the same deep and
intensive treatment as the first.
     Si&#39;ren cast a sidelong glance off to her side.  &quot;Sometimes, Zan, your idea
of what constitutes entertainment disturbs me greatly,&quot; she said neutrally.
     &quot;I see sarcasm eludes you today,&quot; the brigadier countered gently.
     The white-haired woman suppressed the urge to roll her eyes.  &quot;Sorry if I
have had a lot on my mind as of late,&quot; she replied with the faintest of sighs.
The sigh turned into an equally faint gasp as Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s hands slid around her
body to cup her breasts, very gently hefting them up in a soft squeeze.
     &quot;You know you only have to come see me to have your mind taken off other
things,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet breathed quietly in her ear as she leaned forward to nuzzle
the side of her throat.
     &quot;Zan....&quot; Si&#39;ren started to protest very quietly.
     &quot;I know you are busy,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet continued in a soft murmur, &quot;And I know
the importance of your duties, both to the military and to our world.  That is
why I do not make demands of your time.  With as long as we have been together
like this, surely you know my feelings for you.  I will wait with patience for
time to make itself available, as it always will sooner or later, but in return
I ask that you do not deny me moments such as this....&quot;
     Si&#39;ren didn&#39;t resist as a hand slid up to her cheek, very gently twisting
her head around and into a soft kiss that sent a tingle coursing down the full
length of her spine.  She wasn&#39;t quite sure just how long ago Zan&#39;zemet had
essentially seduced her, one thing leading to the next in a series of quiet and
unobtrusive relaxation sessions that ultimately culminated in the emotional but
somewhat awkward relationship that they currently had.
     The kiss was broken a moment later as the comm-link on Si&#39;ren&#39;s belt began
to chitter quietly for attention.  The admiral didn&#39;t even have time to draw in
a breath to mutter a curse before Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s hand reached down to almost rip
the device off of the clip.
     &quot;This is Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet,&quot; she said calmly as she thumbed open the
switch.  She didn&#39;t give the other end a chance to respond as she continued,
&quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren is unavailable at this time, so unless you intend to announce
a global nuclear war I suggest you call back in ten minutes.  And should you be
calling to inform her of nuclear weapons being used or made ready, you may call
back in three minutes.  Hospitality out,&quot; she added before flicking the device
off and tossing it onto her desk.
     &quot;Zan....&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed quietly as she closed her eyes.  She sighed again
as Zan&#39;zemet moved around to give her a deep kiss, sliding her arms around her
bare waist and hugging her tightly.  As always Si&#39;ren found it extremely hard
to resist the other woman, a phenomenon that faintly bothered her.  Not that
she minded being drawn into a relationship like that, even with another woman,
but the inclination for passiveness at her mere touch was still worrisome to a
minor degree.  She was the highest-ranking officer in the Navy and third in
global military authority behind the throne and the Army&#39;s Commander-General,
a four-star flag officer who directly commanded almost a million denizens from
the front lines, and yet she found herself all but dominated by simple touches
and caresses of a one-star garrison officer who knew little of true command.
     It seemed an eternity passed before Zan&#39;zemet finally allowed their lips
to part, just enough to let her speak properly in the softest of whispers.  &quot;I
always believed that if a call was important enough, they&#39;d call back,&quot; she
murmured with a faint hint of coyness.  &quot;That, and no call is important enough
to disturb you when you&#39;re using the toilet.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked and gazed uneasily up at Zan&#39;zemet.  &quot;But I&#39;m not....&quot; she
started to say before being silenced by another gentle kiss.
     &quot;You know that, and I know that,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet said demurely with a fairly
wicked twinkle in her eyes, &quot;But they don&#39;t know that, nor are they likely to
inquire about it.&quot;  She paused for a moment and twisted her head around to cast
a studious glance at the comm-link on her desk, absently making note of the way
it had half-rolled off over the edge and was hanging rather precariously over
her wastebasket.  &quot;They haven&#39;t called back yet,&quot; she murmured as she turned
back to Si&#39;ren.  &quot;I guess it means no nuclear wars are happening today.&quot;
     &quot;Yet,&quot; the admiral replied in a subdued tone.
     &quot;Such optimism,&quot; the Hospitality mistress purred as she leaned forward to
brush her lips against Si&#39;ren&#39;s in a light caress.  &quot;In any case, Si, as much
as I&#39;d like to follow Lin&#39;s advice and put a smile on your face, such things
take time to do properly and I don&#39;t believe in cheap pleasure.  We do have
standards in my division, after all,&quot; she added impishly.
     &quot;How kind of you,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied dryly.
     Zan&#39;zemet chuckled quietly and gave her one final kiss before stepping
back and returning to her position behind the white-haired woman, reaching out
to probe the level of tension in her upper back muscles.  &quot;You still need some
work, however,&quot; she added in a faintly sour tone.
     &quot;I don&#39;t have the time, Zan,&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed as she picked up her bra and
moved to put it back on.  She paused as she felt a hand on her elbow, keeping
her still for a moment.
     &quot;I don&#39;t believe in cheap pleasure, Si, but I do know a few ways for quick
relief,&quot; she explained carefully.  &quot;However, it&#39;s not exactly something I care
to do often as it is.... not initially pleasant.  You will feel relieved when
it is over, however, that much I can guarantee.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked and cast a measured look at the other woman.  &quot;Sounds a lot
like banging your head against the wall so it feels good when you stop,&quot; she
pointed out in a leery tone.
     &quot;Hardly,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied with a smirk.  &quot;It just depends on how bad you
want some relief in your upper back and how much momentary discomfort you&#39;ll
put up with to get it.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m listening,&quot; the admiral assured her.
     Zan&#39;zemet merely smiled at her and made a fist with her right hand, very
carefully running the bony ridge made by the joints in her fingers up and down
the upper portion of Si&#39;ren&#39;s spine.  &quot;It&#39;s one of those surprise things,&quot; she
explained with a hint of genuine apology in her voice.  &quot;If I explain how it
actually works, you&#39;ll probably tense up and it won&#39;t work.  You just need to
trust me on this one, Si, it won&#39;t kill you.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren glared at her for a few seconds before grumbling quietly to herself
and turning to look at the opposite wall.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she muttered.  She cast
a reflexive glance down as Zan&#39;zemet reached out with her left hand, lightly
brushing a single fingertip across the outside swell of her breast.  The finger
followed the soft contour downward and slid across her abdomen to her stomach,
very lightly toying with her navel before flexing in a tickling motion.
     She gasped slightly at the sensation, reflexively sucking her stomach
inward and arching her back slightly.  That appeared to be precisely what was
wanted, as Zan&#39;zemet promptly put as much force as she could on her knuckles
and ran it downwards, parallelling Si&#39;ren&#39;s spine as close as she dared without
putting pressure on the bones themselves.
     Si&#39;ren&#39;s light gasp was transformed into a hideous sucking noise as the
sensation in her back registered on her brain.  The sound coming from it was
not unlike that of a massive zipper being quickly parted as the tendons in her
vertebrae were &#39;cracked&#39; like knuckles in rapid succession.  Each pop produced
a sharp burst of pain, resulting in a line of fire that made her think that her
back had just been fragmented.  The searing feeling all but vanished moments
later, leaving behind only a faint throbbing and a very curious sensation of
warmth.
     &quot;By.... the.... NegaForce....&quot; Si&#39;ren whispered once she was absolutely
certain she was still alive and that nothing was broken.  What little air that
was left in her lungs promptly left in a soft exodus as Zan&#39;zemet gently bent
her forward, one hand rubbing her stomach as the other lightly pushed on her
back.  The feeling of relief was incredible, the stiffness and aches in her
back seeming to melt away to be replaced with more of that curious warmth.
     &quot;Feel better?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet inquired as she brought both hands up to begin a
very light massage of Si&#39;ren&#39;s back.
     &quot;I&#39;d kill you if I didn&#39;t feel so relieved right now,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied with
a steady sigh that was one degree shy of blissful.  &quot;That hurt, by the way,&quot;
she added.
     &quot;I know,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet murmured.  &quot;But I figured it would be worth it.  Don&#39;t
let anyone do that to you again for a few days, either.  What I did would have
a chiropractor soiling his underwear, but like I said, I&#39;m a Healer in my own
right and I know how the body works.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren paused and glanced out of the corner of her eye.  &quot;Should I be
worried about back problems now?&quot; she inquired in a faintly edged tone.
     &quot;Please,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet scoffed quietly.  &quot;I knew what I was doing.  I just
figured that with you being as busy as you are, desperate times called for
desperate measures.  You&#39;ll be fine, honest.  Stretch it out for a moment?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren carefully flexed her hips and back, leaning forward after a few
moments to determine how much flexibility had been restored.  &quot;Wow,&quot; she said
after discovering that she could lean all the way forward again without feeling
any significant or painful resistance.
     Zan&#39;zemet chuckled and leaned forward to kiss the curve of Si&#39;ren&#39;s back.
&quot;You&#39;re welcome, ne&#39;ana,&quot; she murmured softly before she made her way over to
her desk, absently picking up the teetering comm-link and putting it in a more
stable location on her desk.
     Si&#39;ren sighed as she stood up, pausing to stretch once more before putting
her bra back on.  &quot;Now I see why Al&#39;vexi retired,&quot; she observed as she clasped
the undergarment and scooped up her undertunic.  &quot;Getting old is one thing, but
getting old with stiff joints is something else entirely.&quot;
     &quot;There wasn&#39;t much I could do for her,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet admitted as she accessed
her computer network.  &quot;Oh, I could ease the pain on a temporary basis, but she
was developing arthritis in her knee and the near-constant stress didn&#39;t help.
Still, she was a remarkably healthy woman, all things considered,&quot; she added.
     Si&#39;ren made a noncommittal noise to herself as she finished putting her
uniform back on.  &quot;I&#39;m not that far behind her in terms of age, you know,&quot; she
pointed out quietly once she was sure all the buttons were properly fastened.
     &quot;I&#39;m hardly a spring vep&#39;tera myself,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied dryly as she cast
a quick glance down at her display before looking over at Si&#39;ren&#39;s comm-link.
&quot;Ten,&quot; she murmured.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Si&#39;ren said as she looked up at her.
     Zan&#39;zemet shrugged a shoulder.  &quot;Seven.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked before she noticed what the other woman was looking at.
&quot;Ah,&quot; she sighed in quiet resignation as she moved over to the desk.
     &quot;Four,&quot; the brigadier said lightly as she leaned back in her chair and
folded her hands over her stomach.  &quot;Three.  Two.  One.  Mark.&quot;
     A faint smile tugged on Si&#39;ren&#39;s lips as there was only silence following
the pronouncement.  The smile promptly left as the comm-link chittered quietly
a few heartbeats later, resulting in a now-unamused look being directed towards
the smug expression on Zan&#39;zemet&#39;s face.
     &quot;I can handle being off by two seconds,&quot; she replied languidly.
     &quot;I&#39;m sure you can,&quot; Si&#39;ren muttered as she picked up the device and ran
her thumb over the switch.  &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; she sighed.
     &quot;We need to talk,&quot; a flat voice said without preamble.  &quot;Tonight.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked and glanced down at the device, finally placing the voice
after a brief moment of confusion.  &quot;Is there a problem, Colonel?&quot; she replied
in a fairly cool voice.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just say I know why Rune&#39;s k&#39;vesan got stepped on by the Nuclear
Postman,&quot; the voice of Colonel Azi&#39;mar said darkly.
     Si&#39;ren blinked hard and traded suddenly uneasy looks with Zan&#39;zemet.  &quot;I&#39;m
listening,&quot; she prodded carefully.
     &quot;Not on an open circuit, ma&#39;am,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied.  &quot;What are your dinner
plans for tonight?&quot;
     &quot;Booked,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied in a neutral tone.
     &quot;You sound stressed,&quot; the speaker pointed out, his tone still perfectly
flat.  &quot;How about you grab a small cruiser and come on over for an evening
drink or two after dinner?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked before scowling.  &quot;Colonel Azi&#39;mar....&quot; she started to say.
     &quot;Trust me, Si&#39;ren,&quot; he continued, his tone causing her to pause.  &quot;It&#39;ll
be on me.  The Biased Bastard pub in Sector One.  Best seats in the house.  You
really should try to make it.  Good entertainment and better ale.  Oh, one more
thing.... leave the rank in the cruiser.  House rules.  Civilian clothes are
appropriate for this as well, and I&#39;m sure you have an evening dress available
that&#39;s somewhere between cozy and slinky that you&#39;d care to wear.  I&#39;ll see you
tonight, two hours after sundown.&quot;
     Admiral Si&#39;ren just stared at the device in her hand as the transmission
link was closed with a soft snap, leaving her listening to the silence of the
now-empty carrier wave.  She thumbed the comm-link off and absently placed it
back on her belt, turning to give Zan&#39;zemet a truly puzzled look.
     &quot;That was Azi&#39;mar?&quot; Zan&#39;zemet inquired, her eyebrows arched up.  &quot;Odd, he
isn&#39;t normally that brusque.  Granted he&#39;s stiff to begin with, but he almost
sounded like he was.... in pain.&quot;
     &quot;You know what I hate worse than being set up for something?&quot; Si&#39;ren said
in a tone completely devoid of any semblance of emotion.
     Zan&#39;zemet paused for a moment to think.  &quot;Having the situation sound like
something you could otherwise enjoy if you weren&#39;t so worried?&quot; she suggested.
&quot;I can think of far worse things than being wined and dined by him.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t you ever give it a rest, Zan?&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed softly.
     Zan&#39;zemet shrugged to herself.  &quot;He&#39;s actually a pretty good lay.  Granted
it&#39;s not often he leaves his command center in the Northern Mountains and rarer
still that I can lure him into Hospitality for a little.... relaxation.... but
he&#39;s definitely high on my list of preferred guests.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren just closed her eyes and rubbed her sinuses, trying extremely hard
to clear her mind of the mental image.  &quot;Zan, are you sure you&#39;re not a slut?&quot;
she muttered quietly.
     &quot;That&#39;s not very nice,&quot; the brigadier protested with a small pout.  &quot;My
needs have to be tended to on a regular basis, just like everyone else&#39;s, and
when your business literally is pleasure you tend to lose track of what is done
for which.  It&#39;s one thing to satisfy the body, but it&#39;s another thing entirely
to satisfy the soul.  Which is why you mean so much to me,&quot; she added, her
voice growing softer as she spoke.
     Si&#39;ren looked at her for a few moments before glancing away, not entirely
sure what to say.  &quot;So what do you think he wants?&quot; she after an awkward pause.
     &quot;Just what he said he wanted,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied instantly.  &quot;To talk to
you about what he apparently just discovered.  I&#39;m not sure why he&#39;s going all
secretive and mysterious on you, but we both know that he doesn&#39;t play games.
Or if he does, he&#39;s doing so with a very, very good reason,&quot; she added in a
faintly ominous tone.
     &quot;That&#39;s what bothers me the most,&quot; Si&#39;ren admitted.
     &quot;Well, look at it like this,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet shrugged as she silently unlocked
her office door with a casual nudge of a fingertip.  &quot;If nothing else, the ale
will still taste the same tonight regardless.  You do have a suitably slinky
dress to wear, I trust?&quot; she inquired in a tone of faked innocent curiosity.
     Admiral Si&#39;ren just rolled her eyes as she turned to leave.  &quot;Thank you
for your help, Zan,&quot; she grumbled as she strode across the floor.  &quot;Even if you
are a literal pain in the back some days.&quot;
     &quot;A pleasure as always, Admiral,&quot; Zan&#39;zemet replied with a coy smile.  &quot;And
if other kinks happen to arise tonight that don&#39;t get worked out of their own
accord, you know where my quarters are.  Enjoy your dinner conversation with
General Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she called out before Si&#39;ren could completely exit the room.
     &quot;K&#39;ves, I almost forgot about that,&quot; the admiral sighed, pausing to very
gently bang her head against the door frame.  &quot;This has been just one thing
after another.  At this point, I&#39;m ready to put Sailor Moon on the throne just
so she can deal with the problems instead of me.&quot;  She paused for several
moments before glancing over at Zan&#39;zemet and adding, &quot;That was just a joke.&quot;
     Zan&#39;zemet simply shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;I&#39;m not worried about it.&quot;
     &quot;It must be nice to have that luxury,&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed.
     &quot;I guess it pays to be a &#39;slut&#39; instead of an admiral, hmm?&quot; was the coy
reply, prompting another eyeroll from Si&#39;ren.  &quot;Enjoy dinner.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Si&#39;ren muttered as she pushed herself off of the door frame and
strode into the hallway.
     Zan&#39;zemet merely chuckled to herself as she turned her attention back to
her computer terminal.  &quot;Oh, yes, I do love my job,&quot; she purred to herself as
she focused her attention on the bureaucratic side of her job and quickly lost
herself in the virtual stacks of paperless paperwork.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Uhh, Whisper?&quot; Leda said very carefully as she watched the telepath make
a third attempt at convincing her tear-ducts to contract enough to staunch the
almost literal river of tears flowing down her cheeks.
     &lt;Honestly, I&#39;m fine,&gt; Whisper broadcast quietly as she leaned over the
sink and splashed more water onto her face.  &lt;The best a&#39;hiele brings tears to
the chef&#39;s eyes when it is being cooked, though avians are a little less prone
to such forceful reactions like this.  Remember when I took a whiff of that
white vegetable you were slicing up that one day?  Same reflexive response to
heavy spice compounds in the air, nothing to worry about.&gt;
     Leda winced in pain at the memory.  &quot;Yeah, but raw onions can bring tears
to *my* eyes if I&#39;m not careful with them, and I know you were suffering for a
good hour afterwards.  I didn&#39;t think I put all that much seasoning into this,
but I can&#39;t be absolutely sure since Ami isn&#39;t around to scan it with her toy
computer,&quot; she added, casting a leery glance at the strips of meat that were
sizzling in the skillet.
     Whisper stood up straight and blindly grabbed another paper towel, gently
patting her face and eyes dry.  Much to her relief, her tear-ducts remained
largely closed this time, resulting in a slightly watery feeling instead of the
spate of tears that had completely blurred her vision.  &quot;Ahh, there we go,&quot; she
sighed quietly.  &quot;Whew.  Like I said, the meat itself is perfectly fine and the
only real trick to a&#39;hiele is the spicing.  And believe me, I think you found
a good balance.  I&#39;ll be able to tell for sure when it&#39;s done, as a lot of the
heavy spice compounds will have been absorbed into the meat where it can&#39;t
evaporate so easily.  Good stuff,&quot; she added as she patted her eyes yet again.
     &quot;Let&#39;s hope,&quot; the brunette replied with a shake of her head.  &quot;Now I know
why nobody ever asked for it to show up on the menu.  Gotta be hard to enjoy it
if your sinuses start purging themselves the instant you catch a whiff of it,
and don&#39;t ask me how you guys could possibly smell this from a distance and go
from thinking you were being gassed with a neurotoxin to thinking it meant that
a good dinner was being grilled.&quot;
     She paused and blinked as a tingle suddenly shot through her, seeming to
linger for a number of moments before finally leaving.  &quot;Hey,&quot; she protested as
she glanced down at her hands, able to feel a sort of energy residue that was
still present in the very tips of her fingers.  &quot;Did you feel that?&quot;
     &quot;Feel what?&quot; Whisper inquired as she paused and glanced over at her.  She
blinked in surprise before making a gesture to Leda&#39;s forehead, the edges of
her lips curling down in an uneasy frown.  &quot;I didn&#39;t feel anything, but your
Sailor Scout aura just became visible.&quot;
     &quot;My what?  Oh,&quot; Leda said as she held her hand up to her forehead and saw
a faint green reflection of light on her skin.  &quot;It might be Serena playing
with the Imperium Silver Crystal or something,&quot; she suggested.  &quot;You know, with
that ghost of a past Queen or whomever.  Iridum, I think.&quot;
     Whisper glanced at the cooking a&#39;hiele for a few moments before she turned
back to Leda with a somewhat uneasy expression on her face.  &quot;Could you do me
a favor and go check on her?&quot; she asked in a tentative voice.  &quot;Just to make
absolutely sure she&#39;s alright and all.&quot;
     Leda paused at the denizen&#39;s tone before nodding slowly.  &quot;Yeah, you might
have a point,&quot; she replied as she carefully wiped her hands on a kitchen towel.
&quot;I&#39;ll be back,&quot; she promised as she turned around and left the kitchen at a
moderate pace.
     A quick glance around the living room showed that Susan was elsewhere at
the moment, not an altogether unusual surprise given how busy she had been of
late.  Not that I have half a clue as to what she&#39;s doing, Leda told herself as
she made her way down the residential hallway, but just as long as she&#39;s not
getting into trouble.  Or bringing it to our front door, she added with a quiet
but dark mental sigh.
     The rest of the hallway was silent and empty as expected.  A quick glance
at Serena&#39;s bedroom door showed nothing unusual, save for the fact that it was
closed as she figured it would be.  She was about to knock when a bright burst
of light erupted around the doorframe, accompanied by a fairly high-pitched and
quite distinctive yelp of surprise and shock.
     Acting purely on instinct, Leda grabbed the doorknob with both hands and
heaved against it.  She was almost thrown flat on her face with the door swung
open without the slightest resistance, indicating that it wasn&#39;t locked.  She
had figured it hadn&#39;t been but didn&#39;t want to waste the time necessary to find
out for sure, opting instead to use her trademark &#39;direct approach&#39; for dealing
with closed doors.
     A simple movement allowed her to convert her momentum from downward to
forward, letting her take a pair of steps into the room to confront whatever
lay beyond.  &quot;Serena, are you....?&quot; she started to say before coming to a rapid
halt at what she encountered.
     Sailor Moon was essentially nude as she stood in the center of the room,
her angelic wings spread out behind her like so many glowing ribbons of light
as she gave Leda a thoroughly dejected look.  The golden brooch that housed the
Imperium Silver Crystal seemed to be stuck to her bare skin, gently nestled
between her breasts.  Dozens of delicate pink ribbons seemed to be sprouting
from the brooch, lazily looping around her body and hanging limply from her
shoulders and upper arms.  A thin puddle of dark red surrounded her bare feet,
suggesting that it might have once been her boots.
     The spectral image of Queen Iridum was seated on the corner of the bed,
her expression marred by a dark frown of unpleasant surprise that cast the vast
expanse of her void-like eyes into an even more unsettling visage.  Three other
ghostly images stood next to her and Sailor Moon, all of whom were turning to
look at the brunette&#39;s forceful entrance.  Two of them seemed to be as Iridum
did, appearing to be in their early forties and with the same empty void-like
eyes.  The third, however, appeared to be much younger than Queen Iridum was,
perhaps being in her late twenties with distinctively piercing maroon eyes that
matched her hair almost perfectly.
     &quot;...Alright?&quot; Leda finished, almost blinking hard enough to be heard.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; Sailor Moon whispered very quietly, her triple-tone voice seeming
to resonate with resignation.  She glanced down at her exposed body and sighed,
absently tugging the pink ribbons into a position that would at least try to
conceal her nakedness.
     &quot;I doubt that was your fault,&quot; Iridum said quietly as she cast a level
glare at Leda before raising her voice.  &quot;Sailor Jupiter, kindly have the good
grace to quit gawking at your Princess and close both your mouth and the door.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Leda stammered as she quickly stepped to the side and eased
the door shut behind her.  She paused and glanced around the room, trying to
figure out what precisely was going on.  &quot;I was on my way to check up on her
and heard her scream, so I just.... you know.... reacted....&quot; she said in a
sheepish tone as she felt a dark blush saturate her cheeks.
     &quot;As a proper Guardian should,&quot; one of the other spectral images commented.
     &quot;Serena,&quot; Iridum said, ignoring the other woman, &quot;I would ask that you
return to your human form and attempt this again.  While it is possible that
you have made an error with the weaving of your suit&#39;s energies, I suspect that
there is something else at work here.&quot;
     &quot;Could it be too much energy use by the Crystal?&quot; the other figure spoke
up in a faintly raspy tone, watching with interest as Sailor Moon turned her
focus inward.  Her angelic wings began to glow a moment later, seeming to pulse
gently with energy before vanishing with a faint rippling effect.
     Iridum cast a faintly disdainful glance towards the queen who had spoken.
&quot;If you feel that is the case, Roris, then perhaps you should depart so as not
to put too great a strain on Princess Serena,&quot; she said somewhat archly.
     Sailor Moon blinked and turned around, her golden eyes returning to their
usual blue color as her denizen side became dormant.  She watched in silence as
the first queen cast an unamused glance at Iridum before fading from sight,
creating in a faint twinkle of light within the Imperium Silver Crystal that
quickly faded.  Much to her surprise the other queen vanished as well without
saying a word, leaving her alone with Leda, Iridum, and the other young woman
with vibrant maroon hair.
     &quot;Umm, are you guys sure everything is alright?&quot; Leda spoke up in a careful
tone, trying to decide what to make of Sailor Moon&#39;s state of undress.  It was
obvious that her suit wasn&#39;t working right, but as to how it had gone from the
distinctive blue-and-white coloring to pink ribbons was beyond her imagination.
     &quot;Largely,&quot; the young woman replied with a wry sigh.  &quot;Who are you?&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s Leda,&quot; Sailor Moon spoke up as she closed her eyes and began to
concentrate again, etching her face with a series of subtle stress lines.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; the woman said simply, giving the brunette an appraising look.
     &quot;Mind if I ask who you are?&quot; Leda inquired carefully.
     &quot;You may converse later,&quot; Iridum interrupted.  &quot;Once again, Serena, you
are trying too hard.  Focus your thoughts, but you don&#39;t need to try to force
the issue.  The Crystal knows your thoughts and your will, it will respond to
your desires as soon as it has the energy to do so.  Yes, that&#39;s it,&quot; she added
after some of the tension lines in Sailor Moon&#39;s face seemed to disappear.
     Leda watched in uneasy silence as the golden sign of the Moon flared into
visibility on Sailor Moon&#39;s forehead.  The Imperium Silver Crystal began to
glow a few moments later as well, outlining Sailor Moon&#39;s figure in a gentle
white halo of light.  The mass of pink ribbons began to stir, moving almost
languidly at first before starting to ripple in earnest.
     &quot;Wow,&quot; Leda breathed softly to herself in surprise and admiration at the
way the pink ribbons suddenly seemed to shrink and condense, wrapping around
Sailor Moon&#39;s torso to solidify into her distinctive Sailor Suit.  The puddle
of red at her feet began to boil for an instant before it surged upwards like
a crimson geyser, adhering to her legs and arms before gelling into her red
boots and white gloves.  The glow of the crescent moon sigil on her forehead
flared brightly before expanding sideways, seeming to melt and reform into the
golden tiara that all Sailor Scouts wore when empowered.
     &quot;Nice,&quot; the maroon-haired girl said with a nod of admiration once Sailor
Moon opened her eyes and glanced down at her newly-reconstituted suit.
     &quot;Excellent work indeed, Princess Serena,&quot; Queen Iridum added with her own
sagely nod of approval.  &quot;A little focus and concentration is all it takes to
secure the Crystal&#39;s attention, so you don&#39;t need to overly burden yourself in
the effort.  Now then, try once more to assume your angelic form, and don&#39;t be
disheartened if you encounter the same problem as before.  As I said, I suspect
there is more at work here than you may be able to detect and control.&quot;
     Sailor Moon cast a quick glance over her shoulder to look at the fabric
over her back as best she could before she nodded.  &quot;Alright,&quot; she said quietly
as she seemed to steady herself and took a deep breath.
     &quot;Look at it like this, Serena,&quot; the other girl said with a faint twinkle
in her eyes.  &quot;Even if it fails like that again, it can still be used to tease
your lover at night....&quot;
     &quot;Princess Raena!&quot; Iridum snapped as Sailor Moon promptly blushed a vivid
shade of crimson.  &quot;One more outburst like that and I will have to reconsider
allowing you to assist me.  Such a thing is to remain solely between her and
her Prince and has no business being discussed by others, least of all by one
who has no true knowledge or experience of such things.&quot;
     &quot;Princess?&quot; Leda echoed carefully, giving Raena a startled look.
     &quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; Raena replied with a simple nod, her cheeks tinted pink at
being chastised for her suggestive comment.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t born until a few years
after my sister was, so I was never the Crown Princess, but I&#39;m still a member
of the Royal House of the Moon.  Or did you think that Queens and Sailor Scouts
were only permitted to have one child per generation?&quot; she added with a faint
smile as she caught the surprised look on the brunette&#39;s face.
     Leda traded looks with Sailor Moon before shrugging in dismissal.  &quot;Hey,
whatever works for you guys,&quot; Leda replied as she absently leaned against the
wall.  &quot;I&#39;m still chewing on the idea of even having one to begin with, let
alone starting my own branch of the family tree.&quot;
     A decidedly icy sound cut through the air as the spectral image of Queen
Iridum cleared her throat.  &quot;If you ladies are finished,&quot; she said, putting a
mild emphasis on the word ladies, &quot;I should like for Princess Serena to resume
her efforts at testing the design changes to her suit before Princess Raena and
I retire for the rest of the day.&quot;
     Sailor Moon and Raena traded looks before the maroon-haired woman sighed
and took a few steps back, making a gesture to Sailor Moon.  Sailor Moon gave
her a gentle smile before sighing heavily and taking another deep breath.  She
closed her eyes a moment later and turned her focus inward, seeking to unlock
her denizen heritage and release her angelic wings.
     Leda&#39;s eyes promptly doubled in diameter as she saw the way the back of
Sailor Moon&#39;s suit balloon outward before seeming to explode, resulting in a
dazzling burst of prismatic energy as the ribbons of light unfurled and began
to float behind the blonde.  Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes snapped open an instant later,
widening dangerously as her irises melted from a blue to a rich golden hue.  A
sharp cry then rose up from her throat as her body was engulfed in a series of
bright crimson lines, her suit seeming to shimmer faintly before exploding
outward into the mass of pink ribbons that had been seen before.
     &quot;Oooh,&quot; Raena winced in sympathy as the surge in energy essentially turned
what was left of Sailor Moon&#39;s suit into a liquid, falling back down to the
floor to puddle at her feet.  The whirling mass of ribbons seemed to pause in
mid-motion before fluttering down towards the ground, ending up draped across
her body at random and doing very little to conceal her now-exposed body.
     &quot;Hey!&quot; Leda protested as a sharp jolt of energy ran through her, causing
both her green sigil and Raena&#39;s golden crescent sigil to briefly flare into
view on their foreheads.  &quot;What the hell was that?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly in a pained voice as she glanced
down at the remains of her suit, her cheeks tinting pink with embarrassment.
     Iridum sighed quietly and shook her head slowly to herself.  &quot;As I said,
Serena, I very strongly doubt that there is a material defect with your suit.
Rather, it seems that there is another force of energy that must be taken into
account that we must first identify before we can attempt to cope with it.  I
think you have accomplished much as it is, and so perhaps we should call it a
day.  Please reconstitute your suit and reverse your transformation, and I am
compelled to remind you that you will be required to seek an audience with the
collective consciousness beforehand should you wish to transform on your own.
That is not my own will, Princess Serena, but I must yield to the will of the
current consensus.&quot;
     &quot;You could help argue the case, though,&quot; Raena pointed out in a somewhat
flat tone as Sailor Moon closed her eyes again.  A bright flash of light lit
the room as the transformation energies were reversed, allowing the dismembered
remains of the Sailor Suit to dissolve into light and reform into the green
ribbon and blue jeans that Serena had been wearing earlier.  The brooch housing
the Imperium Silver Crystal seemed to hover in mid-air for a moment before it
dropped, falling neatly into Serena&#39;s hands with a near-silent tinkle.
     Iridum cast a somewhat unfriendly look at the older princess, causing her
to edge back slightly.  &quot;The only voice that needs to be heard arguing the case
is that of Queen Serenity&#39;s,&quot; she said in a brittle tone.  &quot;What is a far more
effective tactic, however, is having us meet with Princess Serena on our own to
make our own judgments of her.  Your opinion has been duly noted by the others,
Raena, so it is of little use for you to persist in making noise that will only
serve as an unwelcome distraction.&quot;
     &quot;If you insist,&quot; Raena muttered in a sullen tone.
     &quot;I do,&quot; Iridum replied primly.  &quot;Now then, unless you have something of
practical value to say to Princess Serena, I suggest that it is time for us to
depart and rejoin the others.  If I may, Serena,&quot; she added as she turned to
the blonde princess, &quot;For all her irksome and manipulative ways, Lady Susan&#39;s
suggestion of having me come here to instruct you was probably a wise one.  I
shall, however, firmly deny ever having said such a thing should she become
aware of my views,&quot; she said with open wryness.  &quot;I will not discuss how others
view you at the moment, but instead will only say that I personally believe you
are on a proper path in life and that you should continue to do what you have
come to believe is the right thing to do in this world.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Serena replied with a soft smile, her cheeks taking on the
faintest of blushes at the compliment.
     &quot;Raena,&quot; Iridum said in a far softer and gentler tone than either princess
could remember hearing within the past forty minutes.  &quot;I doubt we will be able
to return in the immediate future, so you may wish to say goodbye for now.&quot;
     The maroon-haired woman looked over at Serena and smiled gently.  &quot;You&#39;ll
be alright, Serena.  After all, you are an angel, both in body and at heart.
Just keep that in mind and don&#39;t let the turkeys get you down.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Serena said again as Raena moved forward to hug her, wrapping
several of her denizen wings around the other woman and squeezing gently.
     &quot;And thank you for your patience, Princess Serena,&quot; Iridum said as she
stood up and smoothed her prismatic dress out.  &quot;And as for you, Guardian,&quot; she
added as she cast a mild look over at Leda, &quot;Do try to keep her out of trouble,
preferably with a little more success in the future than you and your fellow
Sailor Scouts have had in the recent past.&quot;
     &quot;Hey, what&#39;d we do?&quot; Leda protested with a frown as she pushed herself off
of the wall, not entirely sure what to make of the comment.
     &quot;Well, that kidnapping thing probably wasn&#39;t what most would call a bright
spot on your track record....&quot; Raena muttered to herself as she faked a cough.
     &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Leda sighed as she looked up at the ceiling.  &quot;I didn&#39;t see
your fluffy backside coming to her rescue at the time....&quot;
     &quot;Enough,&quot; Iridum said firmly.  &quot;What is done, is done, and all that is
left is to try to prevent any such incidents from occuring again.  I wish you
well, your Highness,&quot; she said as she gave Serena a deep bow of her head.  She
then cast a quick glance at Raena before fading from view with a faint sparkle
effect.
     &quot;Still,&quot; Raena said with a chuckle as she glanced over at Leda, &quot;I think
I like your Sailor Jupiter better than my sister&#39;s, but anyway.  Take care!&quot;
she added with a brief wave before her outline likewise became transparent as
she vanished in a brief shimmer of light.
     Leda just shook her head.  &quot;I&#39;m not even going to ask,&quot; she sighed.
     Serena looked over at her and blushed faintly.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot;
she said softly, her triple-tone voice sounding to be rather amused.  A pair
of glowing wings were stretched across the distance, gently wrapping around the
brunette&#39;s wrist and carefully drawing her over for a distinctly warm hug.
     Leda blinked at the unexpected gesture before returning it, holding her
for several seconds before finally stepping back.  &quot;You&#39;re in a mood all of a
sudden,&quot; she pointed out with a faint smirk.
     The soft smile on Serena&#39;s face seemed to become even softer.  &quot;I can&#39;t
help it if I like basking in the love of my friends,&quot; she said quietly.  She
visibly paused for a moment before she leaned closer, carefully sniffing at
something.  &quot;Whoa,&quot; she said as she edged back, her golden eyes starting to
widen just slightly.  &quot;Did you spill something on your sleeve, by chance?&quot;
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Leda inquired as she immediately brought her sleeve up to her face
and took a hard whiff.  She instantly regretted the move as the resulting waft
of denizen spices was enough to cause her eyes to water up.  &quot;Oh, yeah, that,&quot;
she said, blinking rapidly to try to clear her vision.  &quot;Whisper and I were
trying to cook some avian a&#39;hiele for dinner tonight, and apparently it&#39;s a
good thing to spice it until your eyes turn into waterfalls.&quot;
     &quot;Er, avian cooking?&quot; Serena echoed, giving her an openly unsettled look.
&quot;That&#39;s not.... going to be a problem, right?  To eat, I mean....&quot;
     &quot;Nah,&quot; Leda replied with a soft chuckle and a shake of her head.  &quot;It&#39;s
just strips of meat sauteed in some kind of spicing, that&#39;s all.  Speaking of
which, I probably should go tell Whisper everything&#39;s okay,&quot; she added as she
cast a quick glance over her shoulder at the door.  &quot;She asked me to check up
on you when I reacted to that energy surge earlier.  Umm, you are feeling okay
and all, right?&quot;
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; Serena sighed as she flicked her wings behind her, unconsciously
arranging them in a butterfly-shaped pattern.  &quot;I just can&#39;t seem to be Sailor
Moon and an angel at the same time, that&#39;s all.  At least not a fully-dressed
one,&quot; she added with a fairly dark blush.
     &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Leda replied, giving her a shrug of dismissal
as she made her way over to the door.  &quot;Sailor Moon is tough enough on her own,
and I&#39;m not sure you&#39;d want to be exposing your wings to anything nasty given
how delicate they look.  And don&#39;t worry about showing a little skin in private
by accident,&quot; she added with a momentary glance over her shoulder.  &quot;Everyone&#39;s
seen you like that before and all, so it&#39;s no big deal.  Not that anyone needs
to be traipsing around in the buff to begin with, mind you, all my jokes aside
about the joys of living alone and all, but I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s nothing to
lose sleep over if it happens around here.  Come on, dinner should almost be
ready by now.&quot;
     Serena reflexively reached up to hold one hand to her exposed stomach,
expecting to feel the rumbling pangs of hunger at any moment now.  &quot;Good,&quot; she
said as she followed Leda into the hallway.  She paused as she heard a door
open up somewhere behind her, craning her head over her shoulder to look.
     Leda likewise heard the sound and stopped to check it out, heaving a soft
sigh of resignation as Alex staggered out of her room wearing only a robe that
she didn&#39;t appear to have bothered to tie shut.  The glow of the sign of Uranus
on her forehead was bright enough to make both her and Serena wince slightly,
forcing them to avert their eyes from both it and Alex&#39;s nude body.
     &quot;Yo, Alex?&quot; Leda called out in a weary tone.
     &quot;&#39;Zup?&quot; Alex grumbled as she paused and half-turned around, casting her
slender body in what most would call a universally appealing profile.
     &quot;Dinner in fifteen,&quot; Leda replied as she resisted the urge to bang her
head against the wall.  She personally didn&#39;t have any problems with seeing
Alex in a state of undress, and while she didn&#39;t have any objections to the
blonde&#39;s relationship to Michelle she would rather not have to see the results
of their private moments together put out on public display.
     &quot;&#39;Kay, thanks,&quot; the somewhat dazed blonde muttered with an idle wave of
her hand before she made her way into the hallway bathroom and closed the door.
     Leda sighed quietly and studied the paint on the wall for a few moments to
make sure her mind was relatively clear before casting a glance at the look on
Serena&#39;s face.  &quot;Serena,&quot; she said quietly.
     &quot;...Yeah?&quot; Serena replied in a very quiet voice, her cheeks a solid sheet
of red as she too appeared to be focused on the wall in front of her.
     &quot;See no evil, hear no evil, think no evil,&quot; Leda said carefully.  &quot;Water
off a duck&#39;s back and all.  Think of dinner instead, okay?&quot;
     &quot;Sure,&quot; Serena replied, casting a disturbed glance at her before blinking
hard and sniffing the air.  &quot;Oh, wow, that smells good,&quot; she purred as she took
in a deep breath through her nose.  The effort lasted for precisely two seconds
before she seemed to choke, her hands quickly darting up to her face and her
golden eyes widening to the size of dinner plates.
     &quot;Whisper says that&#39;s a normal reaction,&quot; Leda assured her as she saw the
glimmer of tears forming in her eyes.  &quot;Well, at least for denizens, at any
rate.  In fact, she was crying up a storm earlier like I had just diced a raw
onion under her nose, and she said that meant I was cooking it just right.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot; Serena inquired in a flat tone of disbelief, her
vision now blurred from the tears leaking out from her irritated tear-ducts.
     &quot;Nope,&quot; Leda replied with a shrug.  &quot;What can I say?  That&#39;s just avian
cooking for you.&quot;
     Serena cast an openly disturbed glance down the hallway, blinking as she
saw Whisper emerge from the kitchen and promptly lean against the wall.  &quot;Uh,&quot;
she said in a dubious tone she made a pointing gesture with a pair of wings.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Leda hummed as she turned around.  &quot;Whisper!  You okay?&quot; she called
out as the telepath leaned forward to put her head below her heart, seeming to
be panting for breath slightly.
     &lt;Perfectly,&gt; her voice said in their minds, sounding just a little amused.
&lt;I just took the a&#39;hiele off of the stove and caught a strong whiff before I
could drain all the juices out, that&#39;s all.  Once it cools a little and absorbs
the surface moisture, the smell won&#39;t trigger any more reactions.  Are you
alright, Serena?&gt; she added as she noticed Serena&#39;s mild suffering.
     &quot;Ask me in a few moments,&quot; Serena replied in a flat tone as she tried to
wipe her eyes on the borrowed ribbon of fabric criss-crossing her chest.  The
effort proved to be a futile one, as the material seemed to be unwilling to
absorb any sort of moisture.  &quot;Dammit, I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she grumbled as she
half-blindly made her way back into her room.
     &lt;Trust me, you should like this,&gt; Leda heard in her mind as she made her
way past Whisper and into the kitchen.  &lt;It&#39;s purely denizen in origin, so I
know it&#39;ll be good for your metabolism.  Or at least it should,&gt; she amended
with an audible note of faint unease.  &lt;But still, you should at least try it
first, the smell should dissipate in another minute.&gt;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; Leda muttered to herself with a wry smirk, wondering how long it
would be before Alex and Michelle made an appearance for dinner.  Not that she
minded if they were &#39;fashionably&#39; late, as there were some things in life that
were more than worth putting off dinner for, but she would still like for them
to show up before the food gets cold so she can get their opinions on how the
avian dish came out.
     &quot;Oh, wow,&quot; she murmured to herself as she picked up a fork and speared a
small strip of meat to sample.  The burst of hot juice and spices was enough
to make her mouth water with anticipation at being able to savor more of it,
and a cautious sniff of the air immediately above the steaming pan resulted in
a most savory aroma.
     &quot;So what do you think?&quot; Whisper said as she re-entered the kitchen, only
a solitary tear visible on her cheek as she reached for another paper towel.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I&#39;m going to enjoy eating this stuff,&quot;
the brunette assured her with a smug smile.  &quot;And I think Serena will as well.
Not that she stops to taste most things when her stomach is growling like a
junkyard dog, mind you, but still....&quot;
     &quot;I heard that,&quot; Serena grumbled in her normal voice as she poked her head
around the corner, holding a handkerchief in one hand.  She had returned to her
human form and donned a pale blouse in place of the borrowed succubi ribbon.
     &quot;You&#39;ll be alright, meatball head,&quot; Leda teased her with a smirk.  She
paused as she saw the shadow loom over Serena&#39;s shoulder before Michelle came
into view, her hair still damp from a shower and the sign of Neptune visible on
her forehead as a somewhat faded aquamarine mark.  &quot;Like I told Alex, dinner&#39;s
almost ready,&quot; she called out.
     &quot;It smells good,&quot; Michelle said quietly, seeming to be oblivious to the
faintly unsettled look Serena briefly cast in her direction.
     &quot;You two should go wash up,&quot; Whisper called out as she began to use her
Chaos Factor powers to telekinetically open the cabinet and lift several plates
out.  A small stream of silverware followed after them, loosely organized into
v-shaped groups like so many military aircraft.
     A faint blush crossed Michelle&#39;s face as she edged away from the doorway.
&quot;I just did,&quot; she replied.  She turned to look at Serena, giving her a warm
smile.  &quot;You doing okay, your Highness?  Alex and I felt some sort of energy
disturbance earlier and figured that you were experimenting with the Crystal.&quot;
     &quot;It, umm.... didn&#39;t go as well as we hoped,&quot; Serena replied, edging back
just slightly from the other woman and trying very hard not to imagine what
exactly had happened to cause her sigil to glow like that.  Mina had tried to
explain a lot to her awhile ago, back when they had all gone on a weekend mini-
vacation to the Hot Springs Resort last winter, but some things were still hard
for her to grasp.  Namely, why another girl instead of a guy like Darian....
     Michelle blinked and gave her a slightly startled look.  &quot;You didn&#39;t hurt
yourself or anything, though, right?&quot; she inquired in a worried tone.
     &quot;Only her modest pride,&quot; Leda spoke up dryly as she started to shred a
head of iceberg lettuce for use in a tossed salad.  &quot;Now both of you go find
something to do for a few while we finish making dinner, okay?  Good Sailor
Scouts,&quot; she purred with a wicked smile as they both started to move away from
the kitchen.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Serena muttered in a somewhat flat tone as she made her way over
to the dining room table and claimed a seat.  She looked up and blinked as
Michelle took the seat next to her, giving her a shy smile.  The smile seemed
to falter slightly as she studied the look on the blonde&#39;s face.
     &quot;Is something wrong, your Highness?&quot; Michelle inquired cautiously.
     Serena felt a tiny thread of ice filter into her veins before she took a
breath and decided to speak up.  &quot;You&#39;re.... still glowing,&quot; she managed to say
in a calm and even tone without tripping over her tongue, able to feel the heat
rising to her cheeks at broaching the subject.
     Michelle immediately blushed a moderate shade of crimson and looked down
at the surface of the table in front of her.  &quot;I know,&quot; she murmured quietly.
&quot;I can&#39;t quite control it too well like that.  Well, neither of us can, to be
honest,&quot; she admitted as her blush darkened by three shades.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry if it
bothers you, your Highness.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, it.... umm.... really doesn&#39;t bother me or anything,&quot; Serena found
herself saying in a slightly strangled manner.  She nearly hit the ceiling as
an empty plate and some silverware were set down in front of her, looking up to
find Whisper giving her a concerned look as she directed her psionic powers to
lay out the rest of the table settings.
     &quot;Something&#39;s bothering you, however,&quot; Whisper pointed out carefully.
     &quot;Er, well....&quot; Serena stammered as she cast a brief glance at Michelle
before sighing heavily.  &quot;I.... don&#39;t know,&quot; she murmured as she stared down
at the minute yellow stitching in her blue jeans.
     Michelle visibly paused as she gave Serena a worried look, not entirely
sure what was going on all of a sudden.  &quot;Serena?&quot; she spoke up in an audibly
unsettled tone.  &quot;You&#39;re not upset that Alex and I.... well....&quot; she said, her
blush darkening by five shades as her voice briefly failed her.
     Serena glanced up at her and sighed softly before looking away, her own
cheeks likewise darkening with color.  &quot;I just.... don&#39;t get it,&quot; she confessed
quietly as she looked down at her jeans again.  &quot;I&#39;m.... glad you and Alex are
happy with one another.... but I.... just.... don&#39;t get it.&quot;
     &quot;Get what?&quot; Leda inquired as she carried the steaming plate of a&#39;hiele
into the dining room and carefully set it down on a heat pad.
     &lt;Apparently Michelle&#39;s relationship with Alex,&gt; Whisper telepathed in a
somewhat reserved tone.  &lt;Or at least some of the more obvious aspects.&gt;
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Leda said, pausing to give both Serena and Michelle a startled look.
The other girls blinked and traded slightly confused looks, not having heard
the private message Whisper telepathed to the brunette.  &quot;Serena, I thought we
covered this one already.&quot;
     &quot;Umm.... covered what?&quot; Serena inquired as she eyed the plate of a&#39;hiele.
     &quot;Diverse relationships,&quot; Leda summarized as she raised her hand as if she
were about to swat the long-haired blonde.  &quot;I&#39;m not finished, so don&#39;t touch
any of it just yet,&quot; she warned with a faint growl as she returned to get the
rest of the foodstuffs from the kitchen.
     Serena blinked and traded dubious looks with Michelle before she sat back
and sighed quietly.  She paused as she saw motion and leaned back slightly to
glance behind Michelle, the edges of her lips twitching slightly as a still-
glowing Alex plodded into the room wearing a tank-top and shorts.
     &quot;Damn, something smells good,&quot; Alex murmured as she took a seat next to
Michelle, absently caressing her lover&#39;s neck as she inhaled slowly.  &quot;So how&#39;d
it go, your Highness?&quot; she added as she glanced over at Serena.
     &quot;Not too well,&quot; Serena admitted, giving Alex a faintly uneasy look as she
glanced up at her glowing sigil once again.  The glow had dimmed since she had
first seen it in the hallway, but it was still strong enough to be impossible
to miss.  Michelle&#39;s sigil by contrast was almost completely faded now and was
little more than a faint aquamarine blur cast in the shape of a trident.
     Everyone looked up as Leda returned with the large salad-bowl in one hand
and the small rack of salad dressings in the other.  They were both thumped
down on the table with very little ceremony before Leda made her way over to
take the unoccupied seat next to Serena.  &quot;Run this past me one more time,&quot; she
said in a faintly weary tone.  &quot;What exactly is the problem?  Here, have some
a&#39;hiele,&quot; she added as she grabbed the serving tongs and set a measured portion
down on Serena&#39;s plate.
     &quot;Perhaps it would be best if you were to wait until after dinner before
trying to discuss such things?&quot; Whisper suggested in a diplomatic tone as she
started to scoop out a portion of the salad.  &lt;Susan?&gt; she broadcast a moment
later.  &lt;Dinner is ready.&gt;
     &quot;Nah,&quot; Leda replied with a gesture of dismissal.  &quot;Serena tends to pay
better attention when there&#39;s food involved, so we might as well make the best
of it.  Tell you what,&quot; she added as she looked up at the rest of the group.
&quot;The rest of you guys eat, I&#39;ll handle this one.&quot;
     &quot;Handle what, babe?&quot; Alex inquired as she accepted the salad tongs from
Whisper and started to load up her plate.  She paused in mid-motion as Michelle
leaned over to murmur very softly in her ear, causing the short-haired blonde
to blink in surprise.  &quot;Oops,&quot; she said as she glanced over at Serena, a very
delicate blush springing to her cheeks.  &quot;We weren&#39;t too loud or anything, were
we?&quot; she inquired carefully.  &quot;I mean, I know Mich can be....&quot;
     &quot;Alex,&quot; Michelle promptly interrupted with an under-the-table kick and a
truly heinous blush on her cheeks.
     &quot;Eat,&quot; Leda instructed with a heavy sigh.  &quot;Like I said, I think I see the
problem here and to be perfectly honest I&#39;m probably the best-equipped to try
to explain things.  Or at least until Susan joins us,&quot; she added as she cast a
questioning look down the empty residential hallway.  &quot;Anyway.  So how&#39;s it
taste?&quot; she said as she noticed the way Serena was chewing on a small piece of
a&#39;hiele.
     &quot;Good,&quot; Serena murmured brightly.  &quot;Spicy, but good.&quot;
     &quot;So what is this again?&quot; Alex inquired as she speared a strip of the avian
meat and held up her fork to examine it closely.
     &quot;Avians call it a&#39;hiele,&quot; Whisper explained as she reached for the bottle
of White N&#39;Taki Seven that she favored as a salad dressing.  &quot;It&#39;s spicy even
by human standards, so you can imagine what it can do to us if we don&#39;t take
the proper precautions, but it&#39;s one of those dichotomy foods in the sense that
one either loves it or can&#39;t stand it.&quot;
     &quot;Ra&#39;vel&#39;s idea of a snack, eh?&quot; Alex commented as she sniffed at it.  Her
eyebrows arched up at the smell and she promptly took an experimental nibble,
making a contented humming sound to herself after a few moments.  &quot;Mmm, I see
what you mean,&quot; she said before tossing the rest into her mouth.
     &quot;Guess that means I didn&#39;t screw it up, then,&quot; Leda observed as she took
a bite for herself before turning to regard Serena carefully.  &quot;Okay, so I take
it that you have a few minor issues with the idea of Alex and Michelle running
off to express their love for one another in a somewhat direct fashion?&quot;
     Serena paused in mid-chew and promptly blushed, giving Alex an uneasy look
as her fellow blonde likewise froze in mid-motion.  &quot;Umm.... kinda,&quot; Serena
admitted sheepishly as she glanced down at her plate and started to toy with
the salad mixture.
     &quot;It really isn&#39;t anything to worry about,&quot; Leda assured her gently.  &quot;I&#39;ve
been on both sides of the street, if you know what I mean, so I think I know
what I&#39;m talking about here.  Intimacy in any relationship is nice, and yes it
can be a little.... different if you and your significant other are both the
same gender, but all that really counts are the emotions behind it all.&quot;
     Serena nodded quietly before sighing softly yet again.  &quot;I know,&quot; she
replied glancing over at Alex and Michelle again.  &quot;It just doesn&#39;t.... make
much sense to me, I guess.&quot;
     Alex just gave her a helpless shrug.  &quot;I don&#39;t see what....&quot; she started
to say before glancing over at Leda as the brunette coughed loudly.
     &quot;I said I&#39;ll handle this,&quot; she said in a flat tone.  &quot;Eat.&quot;
     &quot;Damn, hon,&quot; Alex grumbled as she reached for the bottle of Catalina salad
dressing.  &quot;What&#39;s with the kink in your panties all of a sudden?&quot;
     &quot;You ever sleep with a guy?  No?&quot; she added, not giving Alex enough time
to even consider framing a reply.  &quot;Didn&#39;t think so.  I have, however, and I
also spent the best year of my life in the arms of another girl, and believe
me when I say the weather forecast some nights called for localized typhoons
among the bedsheets.  Trust me, I&#39;ve got your angle covered as well, so pipe
down and let me explain both sides of the coin to Serena, okay?&quot;
     &quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Alex sighed as she made a gesture of surrender.  She
gave Michelle a mild look as she reached up to grab her hand in her own, gently
intertwining their fingers together.  &quot;Easy, love,&quot; she murmured as she gave
Michelle&#39;s hand a soft squeeze.
     &quot;Short and simple, Serena,&quot; Leda said as she returned her attention to the
still-blushing blonde.  &quot;Being with a guy is absolutely wonderful so long as he
both knows what he&#39;s doing and cares enough about you to make it worthwhile.
You don&#39;t have to worry about that problem with Darian, so don&#39;t sweat it.  My
first time with Freddy wasn&#39;t all that spectacular in retrospect, but at the
time it was still pretty damn fun.  Reish&#39;id is a hell of a lot better, but
that&#39;s more because of his feelings for me than his.... anyway,&quot; she muttered
as everyone except Whisper started to blush fairly hard.
     Everyone looked up as Susan entered the room, the green-haired succubus
pausing slightly as she noticed the looks on everyone&#39;s faces.  &quot;Is everyone
alright?&quot; she inquired in a delicate tone.  She visibly paused and glanced over
at Whisper for a few moments before nodding slowly, obviously having something
explained to her in semi-private by the telepath.  &quot;Very well,&quot; she said simply
as she sat down at the unoccupied place setting and wordlessly began to pile
some of the salad mixture on her plate.
     Leda glanced at her for a few moments to see if she would say anything,
arching up an eyebrow once she realized that she was going to remain silent for
her own reasons.  &quot;Anyway,&quot; she said as she turned back to Serena.  She paused
and glanced down at her plate before looking back up at her, the other eyebrow
arching up to join the first.  &quot;Hungry, I take it?&quot;
     &quot;It was good,&quot; Serena protested as the blush on her cheeks turned bright
pink.  The hue darkened slightly as Leda gave her a knowing smirk and started
to pile a second helping of a&#39;hiele and salad onto her plate.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; she
murmured once the brunette was finished.
     &quot;That&#39;s why I cooked it,&quot; she pointed out, still smirking.  Her expression
quickly turned back to one of seriousness as she sighed and started to toy with
the contents of her own plate.  &quot;So anyway, like I said, later I picked up a
girlfriend and things got all hot &#39;n heavy in fairly short order.  Yeah, it was
a bit awkward at first, or at least for me since she was already used to it as
she had a girlfriend before, but anyway.  The point is we were in love with one
another, and I mean seriously in-love like Alex and Michelle are, and that sort
of had an impact on the way we viewed things.
     &quot;Was it different that being with Freddy?&quot; she continued as she picked up
a strip of a&#39;hiele and idly chewed on it.  &quot;Yes, but not by much.  Okay, so I
couldn&#39;t get that real-deep feeling of sex, but believe me when I say it wasn&#39;t
missed in the slightest.  Most of the nerves are up front, you see, so the
stars I was seeing at the end twinkled just as brightly because of what she did
as they had because of what he did.  And you know why, Serena?  Because Jenni
loved me and I loved her, and that made it *all* worthwhile.&quot;
     Serena nodded slowly, most of her blush having faded back down to a rather
modest pink tint.  &quot;Okay, but what about.... you know, returning the favor?&quot;
she asked as the blush suddenly returned with a vengeance.
     Leda sat back and shrugged with dismissal.  &quot;What about it?&quot; she replied
casually.  &quot;Stop and ask yourself what you would do for Darian, and what he
would do for you, then ask yourself *why* you would do it.  What a guy can do
for a girl is no different than what a girl can do for another girl, just minus
one or two minor things because of the lack of proper hardware.  And you know
what?  If you really, really miss it that much, you can go out and buy what you
need from one of those novelty stores.  You know, like the one Mina tried to
drag us into when we were at the mall a few weeks ago,&quot; she added dryly.
     &quot;Mergh,&quot; Serena muttered as her ears turned bright red.  She glanced over
at the more calmer looks on Michelle and Alex&#39;s faces before shaking her head
to herself.  &quot;I&#39;m just.... having a hard time picturing this, really.  Or not
picturing it,&quot; she added as she gave Alex a fairly accusing look.
     &quot;Hang on, starlight,&quot; Alex protested.  &quot;What&#39;d I do this time?&quot;
     &quot;Stagger around stark-naked in the hallway earlier?&quot; Leda suggested before
biting down on a small cherry tomato plucked from her salad.
     &quot;Whoops,&quot; Alex replied as she cringed, giving Serena an apologetic look.
&quot;Sorry about that, your Highness, didn&#39;t even see you.&quot;
     &quot;Alex, do I want to inquire what you were doing?&quot; Susan spoke up gently.
     &quot;Nope,&quot; both Alex and Leda said in the same instant.  They paused to trade
slightly unsettled looks before Leda took a deep breath to continue.  &quot;Like I
said, accidents happen and all.  I personally could care less what the two of
you love-birds do in the privacy of your own room, you are more than encouraged
to please one another however you want, I would just rather not see a pointed
reminder ambling down the hallway with the spotlight on full-blast and showing
us just where the massage oil was applied.  And Serena?&quot; she added as she cast
a gentle look at her.  &quot;Relax.  They love one another, they&#39;re not going to
start making advances towards you or anything any more than you would start
hitting on another guy or Darian on another girl.  Love is like that, once you
have who you want in life you&#39;re just not interested in anyone else.&quot;
     &quot;Usually,&quot; Michelle spoke up in a very soft whisper, causing the rest of
the table to blink hard and look at her in perfect unison.
     &quot;Usually?&quot; Alex echoed in a dangerously soft tone.
     Michelle glanced over at her and promptly blushed hard.  &quot;I don&#39;t look at
other women,&quot; she spoke up.  &quot;Not like you do, at least....&quot;
     &quot;Mich, not this one again....&quot; Alex moaned.
     &quot;No, no, I know what you mean,&quot; Michelle quickly assured her with another
gentle squeeze of their still-intertwined hands.  &quot;I know you don&#39;t actively
look at other women like that, it&#39;s just that.... you know,&quot; she stammered as
her blush darkened impressively.  &quot;Every now and then someone will walk by and
you stop to look, go &#39;Hmm....&#39; for a few moments, then go back to what you were
doing and forget about it a few minutes later.&quot;
     &quot;That happens to everyone,&quot; Whisper spoke up.  &quot;Granted it seems to happen
more to men than to women, but I&#39;ll admit to being.... intrigued every now and
then by idle fantasies, even when I was married,&quot; she added with a faint blue
blush of her own.  &quot;Orestan tended to be amused by it, but that&#39;s because we
both knew our feelings for one another were simply too strong to be cast into
doubt like that.&quot;
     &quot;Michelle?&quot; Susan inquired in a faintly curious tone.  &quot;I am not trying to
imply anything here, but I take it that you have occasionally found yourself
intrigued, as Captain Whisper put it, by a young man passing by?&quot;
     &quot;I.... well....&quot; Michelle started to say before her voice failed her as
she saw the look on Alex&#39;s face.  &quot;It&#39;s not like that, Alex,&quot; she protested in
a very soft voice, giving her a deeply hurt look.  &quot;You know I love you more
than life itself, and I would like nothing better than to be your bride for now
and all time.&quot;
     &quot;I know, love,&quot; Alex replied carefully, still giving her an openly uneasy
look.  &quot;Just humor me for a moment and explain the rest?&quot;
     Michelle looked at her in silence before she sighed and seemed to wilt.
&quot;It&#39;s just the whole child issue,&quot; she muttered as she glanced away.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Alex said simply as she gave Susan a somewhat unfriendly look.
     &quot;As I said, Alex,&quot; Susan sighed as she picked up her glass of water and
swirled it around gently, &quot;Both you and Michelle will need to conceive a child
independently of one another in order for your bloodlines to continue.  Once
that concern is dealt with and assuming a medical breakthrough is discovered,
then she will be free to bear a child conceived from your DNA and hers.&quot;
     Both Leda and Serena promptly blinked hard, their eyebrows arching clear
up to their hairlines as the exchanged startled glances.  &quot;Back up,&quot; Leda said
in a slightly uncertain voice.  &quot;You two want to have kids together?&quot;
     &quot;She does,&quot; Alex spoke up before Michelle could draw in a breath to speak.
&quot;I&#39;m still waffling about the idea myself, but seeing how she&#39;ll probably be
the one to carry our child I probably won&#39;t deny her anything.  Of course, that
completely overlooks Sue&#39;s insistence that I get knocked up by some random
stranger first,&quot; she added in a faintly frosty tone.
     &quot;Hey, I hear ya,&quot; Leda sighed quietly as she looked up at the ceiling.
     &quot;Michelle?&quot; Serena asked in a very tentative voice, causing the rest of
the room to focus on her.  &quot;I take it that men interest you?  I mean, despite
being in love with Alex and all,&quot; she amended in a nervous tone as she gave
Alex a slightly uneasy look.
     &quot;Umm....&quot; Michelle hedged, glancing over at Alex before looking down at
her half-empty dinner plate as another heinous blush rose up to her cheeks.
&quot;In a sense, yes, but that&#39;s.... more idle curiosity than anything.  I&#39;m not
about to go out and sleep with one, though, if that&#39;s what you mean,&quot; she said
as she looked up at Serena.  &quot;But seeing how I&#39;ll have to eventually if I want
to have a child before trying to have a baby with Alex....&quot;  She paused as she
seemed to struggle for words before sighing heavily and shaking her head in
resignation.  &quot;I love Alex and she&#39;s all I need,&quot; she murmured softly.  &quot;But
I won&#39;t lie and say I don&#39;t occasionally get a curious about what it would be
like to have a guy make love to me instead of Alex.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Leda huffed as she picked up another strip of a&#39;hiele.  &quot;You&#39;re not
in the Moon Kingdom anymore, girl, you&#39;re in the modern world now.  I&#39;ve got
two words for you: artificial insemination.  You&#39;ll have to ask Ami about it if
you want the really nitty-gritty gory details, but the short version is they
take out one of your eggs, stick it in a test-tube and toss in a few random
sperm cells to liven things up, then implant it back in you once things get
rolling properly.  Junior pops out nine months later, and you don&#39;t have to
worry about some guy not calling you the morning after because you never had to
tango with him, simple as that.&quot;
     &quot;It is a little more complicated than that,&quot; Susan spoke up quickly as
Michelle&#39;s eyes promptly widened.  &quot;But that is one possibility.  However,&quot; she
added in a steely tone that caused her to flinch slightly, &quot;That is a rather
invasive medical procedure and not something to be considered lightly.&quot;
     &quot;And being boned by some guy isn&#39;t invasive?&quot; Alex muttered darkly as she
stabbed a cherry tomato with her fork hard enough to cause it to explode in a
small spray of vegetable matter.
     &quot;Alex?&quot; Leda spoke up before anyone else could.  &quot;I know you&#39;ve got a bias
against the thought, and I damn well don&#39;t blame you in the slightest, but do
me a favor and don&#39;t knock it unless you&#39;ve tried it the way it was meant to
be.  I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll tune out whatever advice Susan might have on the topic,
but good luck convincing Serena it&#39;s not fun.  Well, I&#39;m guessing,&quot; she added
as she glanced over at Serena and saw the startled look on her face.  &quot;I mean,
you didn&#39;t look like you wanted to hurt him or anything that morning....&quot;
     Serena cast a somewhat glacial glare towards the brunette as her cheeks
continued to glow brightly with embarrassment.  &quot;Thank you, Leda,&quot; she muttered
as she quickly resumed eating the remains of her salad and a&#39;hiele strips.
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying....&quot; Leda started to say before she winced slightly
as she felt the equivalent of a tap on the shoulder roll through her mind.
     &lt;Perhaps we should let the matter rest as it stands,&gt; Whisper telepathed
in a faintly cool tone.  &lt;I&#39;m sure Serena now has an increased understanding of
the issue, though I doubt it will lessen her unease at the thought.  I fully
understand it all myself, although that doesn&#39;t make it any more appealing for
me to consider letting another woman touch me like that.  In short, Serena, you
humans have a saying that well and truly applies in this matter.  Love really
does conquer all, including most inhibitions.&gt;
     &quot;Well said, Captain,&quot; Susan spoke up with a subtle nod of approval.
     &quot;I think I understand,&quot; Serena added quietly.  Her cheeks were still a
fairly solid wall of pink, although her normal coloring was slowly starting to
return with each passing moment.
     &quot;Ditto, babe,&quot; Alex muttered as she chewed on the imploded tomato.
     &quot;If I may,&quot; Susan said as she held up a small strip of a&#39;hiele, &quot;This is
quite a flavorful recipe.  I would almost go so far as to suggest that it might
even be on par with a few demonic recipes native to the Underworld.&quot;
     &quot;Umm.... thank you?&quot; Leda said, giving Susan a faintly uncertain look.
     &quot;Now there&#39;s an image,&quot; Alex muttered to Michelle, immediately drawing a
guarded look from the other woman.  &quot;If the Negaverse&#39;s idea of spicy bird-food
can give you gas, just imagine what kind of farts you&#39;d be blowing after a bowl
of something from Hell&#39;s kitchen.&quot;
     &quot;Eww,&quot; Michelle protested, giving her a sour look.  &quot;Alex!&quot;
     &quot;Lady Uranus....&quot; Susan started to say with a truly heavy sigh.
     Leda and Serena traded weary looks before the brunette slowly shook her
head to herself.  &quot;You gotta admit, whether it&#39;s the spices in the food or the
really quirky conversations that crop up around here, there&#39;s hardly a dull
moment to be found in this place.&quot;
     Serena glanced over at Susan and Alex before sighing softly through her
nose.  &quot;I never thought I&#39;d be saying this,&quot; she murmured back, &quot;But I&#39;d rather
things went back to being boring like it was just after we dealt with Queen
Beryl once and for all.&quot;
     &quot;Amen, Serena,&quot; Leda sighed quietly.  &quot;Amen....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     Artemis sighed quietly as he craned his head out of the open window, very
warily eyeing the twelve-story drop to the ground below.  &quot;And what&#39;s wrong
with the stairs again?&quot; he prodded the blonde girl next to him.
     &quot;Oh, listen to you,&quot; Sailor V huffed as she hooked her line to the looped
end of the steel piton embedded in the brick wall and climbed over the edge of
the balcony.  &quot;No sense of adventure, I tell ya.&quot;
     &quot;Adventure is nice, but so&#39;s making it to the bottom in safety,&quot; he said
in a moderate tone.  He sighed as she leaned over to kiss him, her lips making
firm contact with the golden crescent moon marking on his forehead.
     &quot;I&#39;ll be back tonight, fuzzy,&quot; she promised him with a wink as she made
sure her grip on the runner was solid.  She then cast a brief glance downwards
before exhaling slowly and turning her attention back to the cable line.  She
waited an extra second to make absolutely sure she was set before she hopped
off the narrow ledge and plunged into the empty air.
     The runner immediately began to rasp as the cable played out at a rapid
but still-controlled pace, putting V into almost-but-not-quite-free-fall.  Her
descent nonetheless only lasted for a few seconds before she reached the end
of the runner, the tension on the spool increasing exponentially as it played
out before locking up entirely.  The change in tension served to slow her just
enough to avoid killing her ankles as she dropped into a patch of soft ground
that had at one time been her aborted attempt at making a vegetable garden.
Nobody in the apartment building ever bothered the square of dirt in the back
portion of the lot and she suspected few people even knew it was there, but she
still made a point of checking on it every time she came or went to make sure
her &#39;express elevator&#39; landing pad wasn&#39;t cluttered by hazards like discarded
glass bottles or stray cat droppings.
     V quickly locked the runner&#39;s reel in the open position and secured it in
a tiny niche tucked behind the apartment building&#39;s gutter downspouts.  Even
with the cable fully played out, the wire wouldn&#39;t appear to be anything other
than a normal cable wire unless someone bothered to look closely at what it was
attached to at either the bottom end or the top.  Glancing around out of simple
reflex to make sure nobody took any undue interest in what she had just done,
she then set off into the semi-darkness of the alleys.
     She would have been the first person to admit that traversing the twisted
and often filth-filled maze of back alleys and rooftops was hardly a glamorous
notion, as she occasionally found places where holding your breath against the
smell wasn&#39;t enough.  However, the darkness and desolation that they offered
was enough to make it worthwhile, allowing her to cross fairly large portions
of the city undetected by everyone except the occasional sewer rat and the
small community of bums and other homeless people.
     Her current route was one she thought of as the Commercial Highway, making
use of the rooftops of a stretch of two- and three-story buildings that had a
commercial business store on the first floor and with the other floors being
used as a residence by the owner.  The roof was both wide and flat, allowing
her to move at a very rapid pace while shielding her from the curious eyes of
the throngs of pedestrians on the streets below.  There were two places where
she had to return to the ground level in order to cross a street but in both
instances she was able to dart across in semi-darkness between gaps in the
buildings after pausing to check for traffic, seen as nothing more than a white
glimpse of motion that might have appeared in a rear-view mirror if someone
looked up at just the right instant.
     She had just hopped down from a third-story roof onto a second-story one
and was getting ready to sprint across to the other side when she noticed a
tell-tale left for her, a pair of empty soup cans stacked atop one another and
perched on the edge of the roof.  She paused for a few moments as she tried to
remember who in this area knew of her route before she glanced around, nodding
to herself once she realized just precisely where she was at.  Curious as to
what he wanted this time, she jogged over to the edge of the alley and peered
down into the near-darkness.  A faint smirk crossed her face as she spotted him
casually leaning against the wall next to a dumpster.  She leaned over a little
bit further to get a feel for the distances before she took a deep breath and
leapt down into the alley below.
     The bum&#39;s head snapped up as he heard a soft thump above him, his eyes
widening dangerously as he saw what appeared to be a blonde ghost flying over
him close enough to touch.  He blinked hard as she completed her flip off of
the dumpster and landed on her feet a few feet away from him with what most
would have called unearthly grace.
     &quot;Jesus Christ!&quot; the bum blurted once his heart quit lurching in his chest.
     &quot;Hey, hey, JJ,&quot; Sailor V replied with a cheerful smile, her blue eyes
twinkling with amusement at the startled look on his face.  &quot;I saw your marker
up top, so I thought I&#39;d drop in to say hi.  How&#39;s life?&quot;
     JJ just shook his head slowly and sighed.  &quot;Y&#39;know,&quot; he groused as he sat
back and started to breathe easy again, &quot;Most people knock before they drop in
on someone like that.  I just cleaned the underwear, you know,&quot; he added in a
tone of warning.  &quot;Almost needed to have it cleaned again.&quot;
     V just wrinkled her nose.  &quot;I&#39;ll see if I can find you a few bleach tabs
for that,&quot; she said dryly.  &quot;So what&#39;s news?&quot;
     &quot;Looks like the phone rang earlier,&quot; the bum replied with a smirk as he
pointed across the street.  &quot;I don&#39;t know if you know about it already, but I
just figured I&#39;d flag you down to make sure since I know you like to breeze by
here without saying hi.&quot;
     V blinked and looked to where he was pointing at, her eyebrows arching up
as she saw the flickering neon sign of the 7th Street pizza shop.  &quot;D&#39;oh,&quot; she
grunted quietly.  &quot;It figures something else would go down today.  Can&#39;t a girl
keep her calendar organized anymore without having to pencil in someone on her
dance card at the last moment?&quot; she complained, giving him a sullen pout.
     &quot;I thought you liked surprises,&quot; JJ commented as he scratched the mass of
stubble on his unshaven cheek.
     &quot;I do,&quot; V countered with a sigh.  &quot;I just have places to be and people to
smack around tonight, that&#39;s all.  Hey, you want a soda?&quot; she added on impulse
as a thought popped into her mind.
     &quot;Sure,&quot; JJ replied, his eyebrows arching up at the unexpected offer.
     &quot;What kind?&quot; V prodded as she moved towards the edge of the alley to peer
around the corners to get an idea for what kind of traffic was around.
     The bum just shrugged with indifference.  &quot;Whatever they have, just as
long as it&#39;s not that diet crap.  I need every calorie I can get these days,&quot;
he added with a truly rueful chuckle.
     V cast the briefest of sidelong glances at him before shaking her head to
herself.  &quot;Right-o,&quot; she said as she turned her attention back to the street.
&quot;Alright, you just stay put for a few while I go see who stepped on what with 
a pair of golf cleats again, and I&#39;ll be back with your soda in a flash.  Oh,
wow, that&#39;s a nice car,&quot; she purred as she briefly eyed a passing BMW.  She
sighed softly to herself and checked traffic one last time before she took a
deep breath and calmly stepped out of the alley as if she owned the entire city
block it was bordering.
     Timing is everything, as the saying went, and she had timed her exit just
right to coincide with the changing of the traffic lights on the street corner
several feet away.  That allowed her to walk across the road without having to
pause or alter her pace, casually winking at a startled driver as she passed
in front of his car.  She had no problems with Sailor V being seen in public,
but she still wanted to keep her exposure to a minimum as she travelled from
point A to point B.
     She estimated that the restaurant was two-thirds full of hungry patrons as
she entered the front door, absently wondering how many seconds it would take
for someone to notice that a minor celebrity was paying a visit.  She figured
that maybe a full second had passed before an excited kid started babbling to
his mother in a rather loud and shrill voice, waving and pointing even before
the door could close behind her.
     She gave him an impish wink before she looked to see who was standing at
the cash register, feeling a small measure of relief that it was her &#39;friend&#39;
Sal.  She had to suppress the urge to giggle at the stunned look on his face,
as she had never come to claim her message &#39;in person&#39; like this.  Oh, she had
come here several times before to retrieve a message intended for Sailor V, but
he simply had no idea that the young blonde girl with a well-behaved white cat
and knew the proper phrase was the same person as the blonde bombshell standing
before him now.
     &quot;Hey, hey,&quot; she said cheerfully as she strode up to the counter.
     &quot;Sailor V....&quot; Sal said, seeming to be at a genuine loss for words.
     &quot;That&#39;s me,&quot; she replied out of pure reflex, striking a pose.  She cast a
vastly amused smile at the crowd as there was more than one muted cheer from an
underaged fan, wiggling her fingers at them before looking back at Sal.  &quot;Hey,
what can I say?  I get thirsty like everyone else does, so I just figured I&#39;d
pop on over to grab a drink.  Something smells good back there, too,&quot; she added
in a serious tone as she carefully sniffed the air.
     Sal simply shrugged.  &quot;We make fresh pizzas, what do you expect?  Got a
killer Italian menu going, too.&quot;
     &quot;Believe me, I know,&quot; V said as she took a step back and lightly patted
her hips.  &quot;I&#39;m still trying to work off the lasagna I ate the last time I came
here for a bite to eat.  But it was good, reaaaaaally good,&quot; she added as she
gave him a dazzling smile.
     Sal just shook his head, unable to prevent the faintest of blushes on his
cheeks.  &quot;So what can I get you?&quot; he asked, acutely aware of how the entire
restaurant was either openly or covertly listening to every word that V said
and wondering what that was going to do for his lasagna sales in the near-term
future.
     &quot;Just a small soda, if you please,&quot; V said with a soft sigh.  &quot;I&#39;m on my
way to a meeting so I can&#39;t stay and.... get high off that wonderful smell,&quot;
she said as she leaned to the side to inhale deeply.  &quot;Man, I might have to
come back here when I&#39;m done, that smell is absolutely tantalizing....  Oh!&quot;
she blurted out as she glanced back at him just as he opened his mouth.  &quot;Umm,
Pepsi, please,&quot; she said sheepishly.  &quot;Sorry about that, blonde moment.&quot;
     Sal wisely kept his comments to himself as he turned around to grab a cup
and start filling it with ice.  He quickly set it under the soda dispenser and
hit the proper preset, turning back to the cash register.  &quot;Ninety-three,&quot; he
said calmly.
     V calmly brushed the back of her skirt out before making an exaggerated
digging motion on the side of her hip.  Her gloved hand came back up with a
single folded dollar bill, making it seem like she had pulled it out of a more
conventional pocket instead of her Lunar Space pocket.  &quot;Gotta love sales tax,&quot;
she grumbled good-naturedly as she handed it to him.
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; he muttered as he punched in the sale and popped open
the register to make the appropriate change.  He absently reached under the
register to grab the napkin he had placed there earlier and handed it to her
along with the receipt and her seven cents.  He then turned to the soda tap
just as it shut off, leaving behind an almost perfectly-filled cup of Pepsi.
The cup was given a plastic lid before he picked it up and handed it to Sailor
V with a casual smile.  &quot;And here you go.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, thank you,&quot; she said cheerfully as she put the change in a jar
used for donations for a local charity.  She then swiped a pair of straws from
the holder, very discreetly tucking the first one into her glove in a way that
wouldn&#39;t be obvious to anyone else.  She tore open the wrapper on the second
straw and promptly popped it into the lid, idly tossing the wrapper into the
trash can by the counter.  &quot;Wooo,&quot; she said after taking a quick sip, blinking
at the tartness.  &quot;I take it you just changed the cee-oh-two tank?&quot;
     &quot;Just this morning,&quot; Sal replied with an absent shake of his head.  &quot;Just
a bit strong, I take it?&quot;
     &quot;Nah, just has a bit of a bite to it, that&#39;s all,&quot; V replied with a shrug.
&quot;That&#39;s good, though.  Some days sugar alone just isn&#39;t going to cut it,&quot; she
added with a mischievous wink.  She paused in mid-motion and sniffed the air
again before sighing longingly.  &quot;I need to go before that smell makes me buy
something my waistline is going to regret,&quot; she murmured.
     &quot;I&#39;m open until nine tonight,&quot; Sal replied with a smile, still keeping a
casual eye on the mild buzz of his customers.  He knew that word of Sailor V&#39;s
appearance in his restaurant would get out, which would lead to a short-lived
and minor but still visible increase in sales.  Maybe this phone message gig
isn&#39;t so bad after all, he thought to himself as he reached under the counter
to switch off the flicker in his neon sign.
     &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; V replied with open dryness.  She took another
sip of the soda and smiled before she gave him a small wave.  &quot;Okay, I need to
quit teasing my stomach and get going now.  Take care, everyone,&quot; she added in
a much louder tone as she waved to the rest of the crowd.  She waited for the
burst of noise to settle down before she waved again and made her way out the
door, pausing to make sure it wouldn&#39;t slam shut behind her.  She then cast a
quick glance at the traffic situation in front of her before darting out into
the street to cross the road.
     &quot;So how&#39;d it go?&quot; JJ asked as V slipped back into the alley.
     &quot;The usual,&quot; V replied with a shrug as she took the straw out of the cup
of soda and pitched it into the dumpster.  She then pulled out the unopened
straw and handed both the cup and the straw to him.  &quot;Here you go,&quot; she said,
making sure to keep the napkin for herself.  &quot;Careful, though, it&#39;s a little
on the tart side today.  New carbon-dioxide tank in the tap,&quot; she explained.
     &quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; the bum said as he gratefully accepted the soda and tore
the wrapper off the straw.  He ignored the way V discreetly unfolded the napkin
to read the inked words inside as he jammed the straw into the hole in the lid
and took a deep sip of the fizzing drink.  &quot;Yeow,&quot; he protested with a sharp
gasp once he swallowed.
     &quot;Told ya,&quot; V said absently.  She checked both sides of the napkin to make
sure she wasn&#39;t missing anything before she sighed and wadded the napkin up
into a ball.  &quot;Not sure if this is a good sign or a bad one,&quot; she muttered as
she tossed the crumpled napkin into the trash.
     &quot;Anything worthwhile?&quot; JJ inquired as he took a second, more careful sip.
     V simply shrugged to herself.  &quot;No idea yet, but I know that he doesn&#39;t
ask me to call him just to chat about the weather.  Oh, well,&quot; she said as she
craned her neck up to look at the sky, already tinted orange with the setting
sun.  &quot;Yeah, I got time,&quot; she decided as she took a step back and glanced at
the far end of the alley where the fire escape ladders were.
     &quot;Back to work, eh?&quot; the bum asked.
     &quot;Yeah, you know how it is,&quot; V sighed.  &quot;Anyway, thanks for the head&#39;s-up
on the message, it&#39;s appreciated.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks for the soda,&quot; JJ replied with a gesture of the half-empty cup.
     &quot;One favor for another, sounds fair to me,&quot; V said with a shrug.  &quot;Well,
you take care and maybe I&#39;ll breeze past you some other day.  Give my regards
to the rest of the guys,&quot; she added, meaning the rest of the unofficial network
of homeless people that lived in that section of the alleys.
     &quot;If I see &#39;em,&quot; JJ promised.
     V just smiled at him before she trotted over to the fire escapes, climbing
up on the south staircase.  She paused once she was back on the roof to regain
her bearings, sighing quietly as she saw how low the sun was on the horizon.
I can do this, she told herself as she started heading back the way she came,
making a ninety-degree turn once she reached the first intersection that would
normally have forced her to return to the street level in order to cross.
     She covered another two city-blocks of terrain before she came across one
of the &#39;communication nodes&#39; she had rigged up, a small storage box attached to
a nearby and low-lying set of telephone transmission cables.  A simple flick of
her fingertips pried the cover off, revealing a &#39;borrowed&#39; technician&#39;s handset
that had been tapped into one of the main lines.  She picked it up and started
to punch the dialing buttons on the back, keeping one eye on the anchor point
to make sure she wouldn&#39;t jerk it loose.  She then held the handset up to her
ear and listened to the soft static and electronic chittering noises as the
device, normally just used for wire- and signal-testing, created a perfectly
traceless (and illegal) connection to the main telephone exchange.
     The electronic &#39;handshake&#39; seemed to take unusually long to establish
before she finally got a signal, listening to the familiar &#39;dial-ready&#39; tone
before it dialed the number she had just punched in.  The line began to make a
series of soft chitters to itself as the switchboard started to reroute the
signal, an event that was inaudible to normal phone customers but could be
heard by the diagnostic hardware in the handset.  The line began to ring a few
moments later, repeating twice before the other end was picked up.
     &lt;Hello?&gt; a familiar voice said in a rather wary tone.
     &quot;Hey, Mister Banker-Man,&quot; Sailor V said lightly in a carefree tone.  &quot;I
heard you wanted to have a word with me?&quot;
     &lt;Ah, yes,&gt; the banker said as he audibly relaxed.
     &quot;Whatever it is, I didn&#39;t do it,&quot; she added with a faint giggle.
     &lt;I&#39;m pretty sure you didn&#39;t,&gt; he replied in a level tone, causing her to
sober up.  &lt;That&#39;s why I wanted to speak with you.&gt;
     &quot;Uh-oh.  This isn&#39;t about taxes or anything, I take it?&quot; she asked.
     &lt;I almost wish it was.  I don&#39;t suppose you could drop by my office for a
few minutes?&gt; he inquired.
     &quot;Ugh,&quot; V sighed as she glanced over at the horizon again.  &quot;Umm, right at
this very second, no, I&#39;m kinda running against a clock right now.  Just how
late do you plan on being in your office tonight?&quot;
     A soft sigh drifted up from the speaker pressed against her ear.  &lt;I&#39;ll
be here,&gt; he assured her in a faintly resigned tone.  &lt;I&#39;ve got a few other
things on my desk that need a little work as well.&gt;
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; V apologized, knowing that his wife hated it when he had to work
past the usual bank closing time.  &quot;I&#39;ll try to finish things up quick and be
up there as soon as I can.  And if you run out of things to do and I&#39;m still
not done pruning the weeds, go ahead and call it a night.  I can always drop in
on you tomorrow.&quot;
     &lt;We&#39;ll see how it goes.  Be careful, okay?&gt;
     &quot;Always,&quot; she assured him.  &quot;See ya,&quot; she added as she thumbed the switch
to break the connection and stuffed the handset back inside the box.  She then
took a step back and stretched carefully, absently surveying her surroundings
as she wondered what sort of financial concern she had now.  Taxes wouldn&#39;t be
due for some time to begin with, and her tax burden was essentially zero now
with all of her donations to charities and the like.  There might still be a
minor concern with her college savings account, but she couldn&#39;t imagine what
it was this time.
     &quot;Oh, well,&quot; she said to the empty air around her as she looked around to
decide which was the shortest route to her destination.  &quot;I&#39;ll find out soon
enough, now won&#39;t I?  But first thing&#39;s first,&quot; she promised.  &quot;Jedyt, you had
better not be late with all the running around I&#39;m doing to be on-time, or you
are going to be in for *such* a headache....&quot;
     She sighed as she finally made her choice and moved back over to the edge
of the roof, peering into the semi-darkness of the alley below to check for
hazards before taking a deep breath and leaping back into the shadows.

                *               *               *               *

     Tolaris and K&#39;tal both paused to exchange startled glances before turning
back to look at Octane and T&#39;Del.  Both Dragoons were dressed in casual pants
and shirts while Octane was still wearing her open-backed overalls and heavy
work boots.  T&#39;Del, however, was dressed in a modified flight suit and was in
the process of strapping an airframe to her shoulders.
     &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up in an uncertain tone.
     &quot;Do I look like I am making a joke, Commander?&quot; T&#39;Del replied lightly as
she secured the webbing and locked it together over her chest.
     &quot;Okay....&quot; K&#39;tal said slowly, pausing to give Tolaris another uneasy look.
The elder Dragoon simply shrugged in reply and started to move towards the open
hatch of the ground transport.  K&#39;tal watched him climb inside to take a seat
behind Glitter before he turned to regard Octane and T&#39;Del carefully.  &quot;Look,
I&#39;m not about to start making accusations or anything,&quot; he said quietly, &quot;But
he&#39;s been dangerously quiet since you invited us along for this little outing
of yours.  I don&#39;t suppose you can shed any light on things?&quot;
     T&#39;Del shrugged in dismissal, the gesture virtually identical to the one
Tolaris had made moments ago.  &quot;Tolaris and I are.... old friends,&quot; she said as
she walked over to the back end of the transport.  She reached out to pull a
lever, causing the tow cable to start to unspool onto the desert floor.  &quot;That
may be part of his.... discomfort with the situation, although seeing how he
has accepted in spite of his knowledge of my hobby I would be of the opinion
that it does not bother his conscience that heavily,&quot; she explained, picking
up the end of the cable and latching it to the front of her airframe.  She then
gave it a measured tug to ensure that the connection was solid before pulling
the lever again.
     &quot;Huh,&quot; K&#39;tal said slowly, watching as T&#39;Del rewound the cable drum until
there was almost no slack left.  &quot;Mind if I ask how close?&quot;
     &quot;As I said,&quot; T&#39;Del replied in a fairly cool tone, &quot;Old friends.  I believe
I am ready when Glitter is, Chief,&quot; she said to Octane as she climbed up onto
the back of the transport and held onto a pair of handgrips.
     &quot;Alright,&quot; Octane replied as she started to plod over to the open hatch,
pausing to cast a glance over her shoulder at K&#39;tal.  &quot;C&#39;mon, get your butt in
here so we can get going.  It&#39;s a fair drive to Sector One, even with as fast
as Glitter drives.&quot;
     &lt;I heard that,&gt; Glitter&#39;s voice drifted out from inside the transport.
She was hunched over the controls with her fingertips firmly shoved into the
pair of interfaces, positioned more like a motorcyclist riding into the wind
rather than someone simply sitting down at a set of controls.  Her eyes were
closed and her lips didn&#39;t move as she spoke, instead making use of the ground
transport&#39;s sensors as her eyes and the internal speakers as her voice.
     &quot;Don&#39;t start,&quot; Octane huffed as she climbed inside, reaching out with a
pair of tentacles to brace against the seat so she wouldn&#39;t squish Tolaris as
she moved past him.  &quot;We both know you like stress-testing the engines, which
tends to red-line the tachometers and blow sand everywhere.  And before you get
all huffy on me, I already told you I really don&#39;t give a damn how you drive
when we&#39;re in the open desert.  It&#39;s once we clear the tunnel and enter Sector
One that I expect you to drive like a normal denizen.&quot;
     Glitter would have rolled her eyes if they had been open.  &lt;Sure, Chief,
whatever you say.  You coming or what?&gt; she added loudly.
     &quot;I&#39;m coming,&quot; K&#39;tal assured her as he waited for Octane to sit down before
he climbed into the somewhat cramped confines of the ground transport.  He very
gingerly sat down in the bucket seat next to Glitter and started to strap the
restraining webbing over his waist.
     &lt;T&#39;Del?&gt; Glitter called out.  There was a slight pause before a pair of
thumps were heard, as if a boot had been kicked against a roof panel, before
the engine suddenly roared to life.  &lt;Okay, everyone, hold on,&gt; the cybernetic
mechanic warned them before she eased the drive train out of neutral.
     &quot;Hey, what about the...?&quot; K&#39;tal started to say as he realized that the
hatch was still open.  The world promptly blurred around him as the engine
ramped up and everyone was thrown back against their seats, the sudden burst of
movement slamming the hatch shut with a deafening thump.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi!&quot;
     &lt;Wuss,&gt; Glitter muttered as she opened her eyes to cast a sidelong glance
at the somewhat panicked look on K&#39;tal&#39;s face.
     &quot;Settle down, you two,&quot; Octane sighed as she settled against the chair,
absently bracing herself with all six tentacles.
     &quot;Ergh,&quot; K&#39;tal grunted as he sat upright and finished strapping himself in.
&quot;And I thought Asrial tended to be rough with the controls....  What&#39;s that?&quot;
he added as a heavy whirring sound started up.
     &lt;T&#39;Del,&gt; Glitter said simply as she continued to accelerate.  She looked
down at her controls for a moment before she closed her eyes and returned her
focus to a purely neurological level, immersing herself in the interface that
turned the vehicle into an extension of her conscious mind.
     The rest of the group all looked up as the roof started to split open, a
hatch hissing slightly as it first slid inwards, then forwards on a track to
leave a gaping hole that allowed the wind to whistle past them at a rather
unholy velocity.  It took Tolaris and K&#39;tal a moment to figure out why she had
done so, both Dragoons blinking hard at the sight of T&#39;Del using the airframe
as a hang-glider to essentially turn herself into a high-speed kite.
     &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; K&#39;tal breathed as the tow cable continued to play out
at a measured pace, letting T&#39;Del soar higher into the sky.  The stubby wings
of the airframe were not overly broad when fully deployed, but they usually had
enough aerodynamic lift to allow the user to glide down to the ground once
dropped from a suitable height.  This was the first he had ever heard of one
being used for recreation like this, and he found it to be a little unnerving
to contemplate what might happen if something went wrong and that aerodynamic
lift was lost.
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; Tolaris commented quietly, watching T&#39;Del&#39;s flight for a
number of moments before sitting back and closing his eyes.
     &quot;Now there&#39;s an understatement,&quot; K&#39;tal pointed out.  He glanced back up
at the roof as it started to close, the hatch resealing itself and cutting off
the heavy howl of wind that he only now realized was fairly deafening.
     &quot;She knows what she&#39;s doing,&quot; Octane spoke up.  &quot;After all, she&#39;s the one
who came up with the idea.  I&#39;m not exactly flight-worthy with these hanging
around,&quot; she added as she gestured with a pair of tentacles, &quot;So I never took
a shot at it, but both T&#39;Del and Mint love it.&quot;
     &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; K&#39;tal said neutrally, giving Tolaris a slightly curious glance.
He frowned as the other Dragoon seemed to be lost in thought and ignoring what
was said around him.  &quot;So what prompted the idea in the first place?&quot;
     &quot;Would you believe impatience?&quot; Octane spoke up with a chuckle.  &quot;As you
can tell we&#39;re literally in the middle of k&#39;vesi nowhere, so if you want to go
get a drink in a bar or go dig up some supplies or spare parts you have to grab
a transport and drive a good hundred miles or so to one of the other depots.
You could dispatch a cargo drone, of course, but who knows how long it would be
for someone to get around to loading it up for you.&quot;
     &lt;Speaking of cargo drones,&gt; Glitter spoke up, &lt;There&#39;s one heading our way
now.  It looks to be on the Sector Five outbound track.&gt;
     &quot;That would explain the delay,&quot; Octane sighed as she reached up to rub the
back of her neck with a pair of tentacles.  &quot;We send the request to Sector One,
they drop it in Sector Five&#39;s lap, and some poor bird-mechanic gets to root
through the scrap heap to find some working communication crystals.  Hey,&quot; she
added in mild protest as the transport was suddenly rocked hard by something.
     K&#39;tal blinked as the cargo drone shot past them, seeming to be little more
than a giant metal wheel with a pair of storage containers welded to a rotating
frame mounted on the axle.  &quot;What in the name of the NegaForce was that?&quot; he
asked, giving Glitter a disturbed look as the vehicle continued to be buffeted
by the shockwave trailing behind the almost-supersonic drone.
     &lt;A desert cargo drone,&gt; Glitter replied with a casual shrug, keeping the
transport&#39;s velocity as steady as she could.  &lt;If you can&#39;t use a transport
like the one you&#39;re in now, your only alternative is to hitch a ride on one of
those as cargo.&gt;
     &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot; K&#39;tal said, casting a glance towards the rear of
the vehicle as if he were trying to look out of a non-existent back window.
     &quot;Nope,&quot; Octane spoke up with a dry chuckle.  &quot;And believe me when I say it
is not the Negaverse&#39;s most comfortable ride.  So anyway, T&#39;Del once had to
hitch a ride on a drone out to Sector One for a performance after Glitter here
had ruined the drive-train on our usual transport....&quot;
     &lt;That&#39;s right,&gt; Glitter muttered darkly to K&#39;tal, &lt;Blame the pilot and not
the faulty weld on the engine assembly....&gt;
     &quot;So once T&#39;Del came back,&quot; Octane continued without missing a beat, &quot;She
sat down and tried to think of a new way of crossing the desert sands without
becoming a supersonic tumbleweed.  We&#39;re still trying to figure out what kind
of wires she had to cross in her brain to come up with the idea, but about a
week afterwards she starts welding tow-cables to every drone that comes out
here and puts in a request for airframes to be added to our inventory.  Next
thing we know, we&#39;ve got the hot-shots from Sector Five paying us a visit and
asking her all sorts of questions about her new idea.  Long story short, her
drone-kite idea goes up the chain and everyone from here to Sector One starts
playing with the &#39;sky-surfing&#39; concept.&quot;
     &quot;Unique,&quot; Tolaris commented quietly, still keeping his eyes closed.
     &lt;You need to be hooked to a transport that can move fast enough to keep
you aloft, however,&gt; Glitter spoke up.  &lt;Cargo drones weren&#39;t intended to carry
living passengers, so they&#39;re built to travel as fast as their drive-trains can
manage.  That makes them fairly decent platforms for kiting, although you do
have to be careful about such things like windstorms and tunnels.&gt;
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; K&#39;tal said with a faintly sour look.  &quot;I can see how entering a
tunnel would be a little problematic.  Speaking of which....&quot;
     &lt;I&#39;ll reel her in before we get close to the mountain tunnel,&gt; Glitter
replied casually.  &lt;Relax.  Okay, so I&#39;ve driven a few people around I wouldn&#39;t
mind seeing splattered across the mountainside at high velocity, but believe me
when I say T&#39;Del certainly isn&#39;t one of them.&gt;
     &quot;That&#39;s comforting,&quot; K&#39;tal said with a faint chuckle.  &quot;You ever try to
fly around on an airframe like that?&quot;
     &lt;I&#39;ll stay on the ground, thanks,&gt; the drone pilot responded with a flat
sound from the speakers.  &lt;Besides, I&#39;m the only one who can drive this thing
fast enough to create enough lift without causing any problems.&gt;
     &quot;Conventional problems, you mean,&quot; Octane spoke up dryly.
     &lt;You know, Chief, if you don&#39;t like my driving, you are cordially invited
to get out and walk....&gt;
     &quot;Settle down,&quot; Octane sighed.
     K&#39;tal just shook his head to himself.  &quot;So how much longer is it to this
pub in Sector One?&quot; he inquired carefully.
     &lt;Pipe down,&gt; Glitter grumbled as she opened her eyes to cast a sidelong
glance at him, a look made all the more menacing due to her jet-black and
featureless eyes.  &lt;It&#39;s not like I have scramjet thrusters mounted on this
thing, so we&#39;re a little limited in terms of speed.  It&#39;ll be another thirty
minutes or so until we hit the tunnel, and since the Master Chief here doesn&#39;t
like hearing echoes I&#39;ll have to slow down while we traverse it.&gt;
     &quot;Don&#39;t start with me,&quot; the curly-haired chief mechanic grumbled.  &quot;You saw
the same engineer briefing I did about what happens to the tunnel walls when
you drag a supersonic shockwave inside with you.  Especially one comprised of
compacted sand,&quot; she added.
     Glitter simply shrugged.  &lt;It needs a new coat of paint anyway.&gt;
     &quot;You ladies travel to Sector One together like this often?&quot; K&#39;tal asked in
a fairly neutral tone, casting a glance at Tolaris&#39; expression.
     &quot;Fairly often,&quot; Octane replied with an absent shrug.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; K&#39;tal said with a nod of understanding.
     &quot;Why?&quot; Octane inquired as she gave him a somewhat suspicious look.
     &quot;It would explain why T&#39;Del opted to fly by herself instead of having to
deal with the two of you,&quot; the Dragoon replied with a wicked chuckle.
     &quot;Be nice,&quot; Tolaris murmured quietly, obviously trying not to smile.
     &lt;Guess who&#39;s walking home tonight?&gt; Glitter grumbled.
     Octane merely grunted softly to herself.  &quot;If you think we&#39;re bad, wait
until you have to drive out to the Dome with Mint.  Three hours out and a full
seven on the way back when you&#39;re hauling liquid oxygen tanks and can&#39;t go over
a certain speed.&quot;
     &lt;And without any gum to shut her up,&gt; Glitter snarled.
     &quot;Who are you kidding?&quot; Octane countered.  &quot;I was this close to breaking
both your jaws before Taffy managed to shut Mint up, and she only did it so
Gravija wouldn&#39;t be forced to keep her promise to sit on the little slut.  And
believe me, I think she was serious about it, too.&quot;
     &lt;No, I believe you,&gt; Glitter replied quickly.  &lt;But I still say Taffy was
reacting more to Gravija&#39;s threat to pass gas after she sat on Mint rather than
the actual threat of sitting on her.  Not that I blame Taffy in the least....&gt;
     &quot;You ladies aren&#39;t exactly painting a rosy picture of your unit,&quot; K&#39;tal
spoke up in a somewhat guarded tone.
     Octane grumbled quietly as she crossed her arms over her large chest, her
tentacles likewise mimicking the movement.  &quot;We&#39;re mechanics, not a bunch of
prissy drama-queens,&quot; she pointed out.  &quot;As long as we get the job done right,
and believe me when I say we almost always do, I could care less about what you
formal uniform types think of how we do things.  Let&#39;s see you spend a couple
of years working in the desert like this and see how smooth your edges are at
the end.  Trust me, delicate flowers don&#39;t last long in this environ.&quot;
     &lt;Settle down, Chief,&gt; Glitter chuckled, producing a somewhat raspy sound
from the internal speakers.  &lt;Okay, so neither of us qualify as ladies, but I&#39;m
sure T&#39;Del does and Taffy seems to be coming along just fine.&gt;
     &quot;Only because of T&#39;Del&#39;s influence,&quot; Octane pointed out.  &quot;Otherwise Mint
would have corrupted her years ago.  And you&#39;re not exactly helping, either,&quot;
she added dryly.
     &lt;Now what did I do?&gt; the drone pilot protested sourly.
     &quot;Discover the hard way what happens to a protomorph when she exposes her
mind to a skewed field of psionic energy,&quot; Octane pointed out.
     &lt;Here we go again,&gt; Glitter sighed.  &lt;You tried it yourself, you know.&gt;
     &quot;Yes, but I didn&#39;t need to be vacuumed up into a liquid holding tank so I
wouldn&#39;t flow down the drain,&quot; Octane replied tartly.  &quot;And I told you after I
tried it that you shouldn&#39;t let anyone else use your little mind-bending gear
since it was only intended for neural circuitry.&quot;
     K&#39;tal shook his head and leaned forward as best he could in spite of the
web of restraints around him.  &quot;Tolaris, are you alright?&quot; he asked gently.
     &quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Tolaris replied with a quiet sigh.
     &quot;So why the look of constipation?&quot; K&#39;tal prodded, causing Tolaris to crack
open one eye to glare at him.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;m glad we&#39;re heading to a bar,&quot; Tolaris replied in
a tone as dry as the desert sands around him.  &quot;A stiff drink sounds good right
about now, and not just because listening to our hosts go back and forth is
every bit as bad as listening to Serena and Rei argue.&quot;
     Octane glanced over at Glitter&#39;s back before shaking her head to herself.
&quot;Should I even ask?&quot; she inquired with a casual chuckle.
     &quot;The humans have a saying,&quot; Tolaris said, keeping his expression perfectly
neutral.  &quot;The more people I meet, the more I like my dog.&quot;
     There was a sudden silence in the transport before the speaker made a very
soft clicking sound as Glitter cleared her throat.  &lt;Okay, I&#39;ll ask,&gt; she said
when she realized that Octane wasn&#39;t going to inquire.  &lt;What&#39;s a dog?&gt;
     &quot;This is going to be a long drive,&quot; K&#39;tal muttered quietly to himself.

                *               *               *               *

     He looked around with disdain as he entered the abandoned church, trying
not to inhale too deeply.  The stone walls were layered with a decade of dust
and cobwebs while most of the stained glass windows were shattered.  A draft of
dank air seemed to hover around the ruined altar and rotting pews, almost as if
the once-holy aura had become corrupted by the passage of time.
     The massive wooden door behind him suddenly creaked open without warning,
the sound of rusted metal echoing quite loudly in the empty rafters.  He made
a bold decision and deliberately kept his back to the new arrival, listening in
tense silence as the door creaked closed again.  He decided it was best to test
her trustworthiness and sincerity in making peace now rather than have to wait
to see if she was wasting his time with this.
     He raised an eyebrow as she silently slipped past him carrying a small lit
candle.  She set the blue candle on the decrepit altar with surprising grace
and reverence before kneeling before it in a momentary prayer.  He was able to
catch a few soft-spoken words muttered under her breath, but he had the feeling
that the language used was most definitely not her native tongue.
     She finished her prayer and rose to her feet, making the sign of the holy
cross before sighing and turning to face her momentary companion.  &quot;So I was
raised in a Catholic family,&quot; she said quietly in response to his expression.
&quot;Sue me.&quot;
     &quot;An abandoned church, how quaint,&quot; Jedyt said with a faint sneer.
     Sailor V raised a delicate eyebrow.  &quot;Abandoned or not, this church is
still holy ground so try to show a little respect, okay?&quot;
     He looked around him briefly before mentally shrugging.  &quot;So anyway, you
obviously wanted to talk about something since you asked me to be here.  I&#39;m
here as you requested, so what can I do for you?&quot;
     &quot;Simple, really,&quot; she replied as she moved over to a pew and examined it
for stability.  She nudged it with her foot, and once she was satisfied that it
wouldn&#39;t fall out from under her in the forseeable future she carefully sat
down.  &quot;I want you to tell me why you paid a little visit to the Cherry Hill
Temple the other day.&quot;
     He rolled his eyes and crossed his arms.  &quot;I thought you said you heard
what I told the others,&quot; he groused.  &quot;I just wanted to let Sailor Moon know
just how special she is to the Negaverse.&quot;
     V snorted in contempt.  &quot;Aww, ain&#39;t that sweet, she spanks you around for
a few months and you start getting a craving for more tough love.  I don&#39;t give
a dead rat&#39;s rear end why you wanted to talk to Sailor Moon, pretty boy, I want
to know why you dropped in on Rei Hino.&quot;
     A soft snarl emerged from Jedyt&#39;s throat.  &quot;You know as well as I do that
Rei is really Sailor Mars,&quot; he hissed.
     She looked up at him with a faked yawn.  &quot;So she is.  Your point?&quot;
     He just shook his head.  &quot;What better way to draw Sailor Moon&#39;s attention
than to find one of her friends?  I thought you would have been smart enough to
figure that one out yourself, but I see what they say about blondes is true.&quot;
     She laughed quietly.  &quot;I hate to break this to you, sugar, but have you
looked in a mirror latley?  Oh, and should I bother to mention how many times
my ditzy, air-headed self has kicked the crap out of your so-called Negaverse
elite agents?&quot;
     He sighed and looked up at the cracked ceiling.  &quot;Is there a point to your
babbling, girl, or are you wasting my time for your twisted amusement?&quot;
     &quot;Here&#39;s the point, muffin,&quot; she said flatly as she stood up and walked
over to him, leaning forward until they were almost nose-to-nose.  &quot;I actually
believe your spiel about not being Sailor Moon&#39;s blood-sworn enemy anymore, I
really do.  Scary, isn&#39;t it?&quot;
     He stared back at her with equal intensity.  &quot;Go on,&quot; he prodded.
     &quot;What I don&#39;t believe is that you visited Rei just so you could flag down
the attention of our beloved Sailor Moon,&quot; she said in an edged tone.  &quot;I have
a bit of a hunch that you have something else in mind.  Call it a girl&#39;s sixth
sense if you want, but I don&#39;t like it.  Nope, don&#39;t like it one bit.&quot;
     &quot;How terrible for you,&quot; he replied evenly.
     &quot;Listen, ptanka,&quot; V growled, &quot;I want to know what you&#39;re up to.  That load
of navidshi you spouted about being retired was quite a speech, but you can
spray Eau de Cologne on a cow-patty and it&#39;d still be a pile of crap.&quot;
     A soft smile tugged on the edges of his lips.  &quot;My, you&#39;re a rather foul-
mouthed little girl.  Who taught you such language?&quot; he said in bemusement.
     She took a step back and reached for her Lunar Space pocket, making sure
to move slow enough so he wouldn&#39;t be startled by her movements.  Her hand came
back up a moment later holding her stiletto in a loose grip that wouldn&#39;t be
immediately seen as threatening.  &quot;It is absolutely fascinating what kind of
language skills you can learn from someone when you&#39;re cutting their testicles
off,&quot; she said with a cruel smile.  &quot;You remember that one agent you guys sent
to try to kill me on Halloween, the big hulking brute with blue skin?&quot;
     Jedyt wasn&#39;t worried about the blade at all, but her description of the
agent gave him a decidedly unpleasant chill.  &quot;You&#39;re bluffing,&quot; he said in a
flat tone, trying desperately to remember of any reports of slain Negaverse
agents having been mutilated.
     &quot;Put it like this,&quot; she whispered quietly with sadistic glee.  &quot;He was a
well-endowed fellow for a denizen, having four eggs in the nest instead of the
usual two.  I think his name was Halon, kinda cute despite the blue skin and
attempt on my life.  By the time I was done with him, however, his new name was
Johnny One-Nut and I had learned a wealth of new denizen words.&quot;
     He blinked hard as she leaned even closer, kissing the tip of his nose as
she tossed the blade into the air before catching it by the point and returning
it to her Lunar Space pocket.  &quot;You little bitch....&quot; he hissed, his complexion
darkening with rage.
     &quot;That&#39;s Ms. Bitch to you, punk,&quot; she said flatly.  &quot;Now let&#39;s get back to
the original question, shall we?  I don&#39;t think you chose to visit the Cherry
Hill Temple on a whim, nor do I believe you did it &#39;just&#39; to get the attention
of Sailor Moon.  So again, what did you want?&quot;
     He closed his eyes and counted to ten, trying to calm his breathing before
he did something he would most likely regret.  &quot;Alright then, if that&#39;s the way
you want it,&quot; he said quietly.  He opened his eyes and gave her a penetrating
stare.  &quot;This one stays just between you and me for the moment.&quot;
     Sailor V blinked and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;What, a secret, just for me?
Aww, honey, you shouldn&#39;t have,&quot; she said, her voice dripping sarcastic scorn.
     &quot;I see your so-called wit hasn&#39;t changed,&quot; he growled.
     &quot;And I&#39;m supposed to believe you&#39;ve changed?&quot; she shot back with a degree
of vehemence that surprised them both.  &quot;Mister I&#39;ve-given-up-on-my-world?&quot;
     &quot;What do you know of what I&#39;ve been through?&quot; Jedyt snapped.  &quot;Child, you
have NO IDEA what it&#39;s like to be frozen in crystal for months, unable to rest,
unable to move, unable to even lose your mind in sleep!  Can you imagine being
fully conscious for days at a time?  Weeks?  Unable to see you surroundings,
unable to interact with anything, unable to even hear your own heart beating to
use as a measure of the passage of time?&quot;
     &quot;My heart bleeds for you,&quot; she said dryly.  &quot;Maybe next time you won&#39;t be
so eager to try to invade another world, hmm?&quot;
     He leaned forward until their noses almost touched.  &quot;That, my dear, is
precisely my point,&quot; he said in a very soft tone.  &quot;Everything I&#39;ve fought for
over the past thirteen centuries is gone.  My queen is dead, my career wasted,
and no friends left alive to speak of.  There is very little left for me in my
world, and I am finally sick of it all.&quot;
     She blinked hard and took a step back, giving him a very wary look as she
digested his words.  &quot;Alright, Sparky, let&#39;s just say for the sake of argument
that you&#39;re sincere and that, God forbid, I decide to play along with this
little song-and-dance,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;What do you want from us?&quot;
     &quot;Peace,&quot; he said simply.  &quot;I just want to be left alone to my own devices,
which no longer include death, destruction, conquest, or anything else that you
girls might find upsetting.  After taking the time to stop and look around at
the landscape, alien as it is, I think I actually like this pretty blue world
of yours.&quot;
     &quot;Riiiiiiiight,&quot; she sighed as she rubbed her nose.  &quot;If you&#39;re serious
about wanting to settle down, I know someone who can fix you up with a nice
piece of Siberia.  It&#39;s a peaceful place, rather remote, but with fairly decent
neighbors.  It&#39;s a bit seasonal in the weather department, though, so you gotta
dress in layers for the winter snows.&quot;
     He snorted with contempt.  &quot;Thanks, but I&#39;m not into arctic tundra.&quot;
     She shrugged causally.  &quot;&#39;Twas worth a shot.  Now, about this just-for-me
secret you mentioned earlier....&quot;
     Jedyt sighed very quietly and glanced over his shoulder, briefly studying
the blue candle as the flame flickered slightly in a draft.  &quot;You&#39;re right, I
did stop by Rei&#39;s temple for another reason,&quot; he admitted quietly.
     She wrinked her nose slightly.  &quot;Sometimes I hate being right,&quot; she said,
mostly to herself.  &quot;Go on.&quot;
     He sighed again and looked back at her.  &quot;I want to get to know Rei.&quot;
     That drew a hard blink from the blonde.  &quot;Excuse me?&quot;
     &quot;I know she and I have never stopped to say hello in the past, so this is
a bit difficult to fathom,&quot; he said in a guarded tone.  &quot;But I would like to
get to know her.  And I mean Rei, not Sailor Mars.  Believe me, I am already
quite acquainted with our little pyromancer.&quot;
     &quot;Mmm, I&#39;ll bet....&quot; she said languidly.  &quot;Speaking of making friends, that
reminds me of a story I heard once.  Something about you making out with a 747
on the tarmac at the airport?&quot; she inquired lightly.
     He gritted his teeth and glanced away.  &quot;Yes, I was run over by a large
passenger aircraft and barely survived being pinned between the front tires.
Are you satisfied now?&quot; he growled.
     Sailor V shrugged.  &quot;At least you&#39;ve got the guts to admit it,&quot; she said
with a casual stretch.  &quot;So why Rei, hmm?  Something about her has to pique
your interest enough to cross a dimensional boundary.&quot;
     &quot;What&#39;s it matter to you?&quot; he demanded as he crossed his arms.
     &quot;Oh, it matters to me, pumpkin, it matters a whole lot,&quot; she assured him
with a slight edge to her voice.  &quot;Y&#39;see, Rei is a good girl.  A little rough
around the edges, perhaps, but she&#39;s still good people.  And as she and I are
rather good friends, I would take it quite personally if some sleezeball from
the Negaverse tried to cuddle up to her with the intention of getting into her
panties.  Especially one with a proven past of failed assassination attempts on
her life and the lives of her friends.  A very big no-no in my book.&quot;
     He raised an eyebrow at the accusation.  &quot;I think you&#39;re reading just a
little too deeply into this one, my dear.  I said I wanted to get to know her,
nothing more.&quot;
     &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; she replied nonchalantly.  &quot;And of course getting to know her in
an intimate way would never, ever cross the bastion of virtue that is your so-
called mind, right?&quot;
     His arms dropped to his sides and his hands curled into fists.  &quot;I assure
you that I have had no such thoughts, interesting as it sounds.  At least not
about Rei.  You will, of course, forgive me if I confess to entertaining a few
dark fantasies about being able to have my way with you in the event of your
capture by Negaverse agents,&quot; he said with a leering grin.
     &quot;What, you want to ravish lil&#39; ol&#39; me?&quot; she said in mock-surprise, her
voice turning sultry.  &quot;Oh, baby, I had no idea.  And here I was thinking that
you were just being a prick out of sheer spite....&quot;
     He sighed and resisted the urge to roll his eyes at her verbal antics.
&quot;Are you finished?&quot; he said sourly.
     &quot;Maybe,&quot; she said flatly.
     &quot;I take it you&#39;re not convinced that I&#39;m serious?&quot; he prodded.
     &quot;Nope, not at all,&quot; she confirmed.
     He gritted his teeth as he stared into the depths of her blue eyes.  &quot;So
what will it take, hmm?&quot; he demanded.  &quot;Shall I sign a document in blood that
I only want to talk to Rei, to get to know her and nothing more?&quot;
     &quot;Oh, please do,&quot; she replied instantly as she brought the stiletto back
out and held it up.  &quot;Honey, you have no idea how long I&#39;ve been waiting to see
you shed some blood, and the more the better....  *HEY!*&quot;
     She tensed as he promptly grabbed her wrist in one hand and swiped his
other hand across the sharpened tip of the knife.  &quot;Will this suffice?&quot; he said
flatly as tiny flecks of dark blue blood were splattered across her wrist and
along the length of the steel blade.  A rivulet of blood began flowing across
his hand, gathering together at the tips of his fingers and dripping down to
splash the dusty marble flooring.
     Sailor V blinked hard and took a step back, casting an uneasy glance at
the severity of the wound in his palm.  &quot;You&#39;re serious,&quot; she said, more as a
statement than as a question.
     &quot;So nice to be believed,&quot; he said as he turns his hand up to examine what
he had just done.  &quot;Shall I write on the walls now, or do you get the point?&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s not needed,&quot; she said quietly, still slightly mesmerized by the
sight of his alien blood.  She had drawn various colors of blood from hostile
denizens before, of course, but for some reason the sheer intensity of emotion
behind his gesture bothered her.  She blinked again and looked up at him.  &quot;So
again.... why Rei?&quot;
     He snorted quietly as he took a handkerchief from his pocket and balled
it up in his wounded hand.  &quot;That, my dear, is a mystery even to me,&quot; he said
very quietly as he sat down on a pew.  &quot;Being trapped in Beryl&#39;s crystal prison
was a nightmare the likes of which you cannot possibly be able to fathom.  My
mind was.... starved of sensory input, no way to tell what was happening.  All
I could do was think, and remember, and reflect.  You have no idea how quickly
my mind started to unravel at the seams.&quot;
     She decided to pass on a flip remark and instead leaned on the pew next to
him, still not entirely sure of either the stability of the rotted pew or of
the sincerity of the Negaverse general&#39;s words.
     &quot;Two things kept me sane.... the thought of vengeance on Sailor Moon, and
the memories I had of Rei,&quot; he continued after a moment&#39;s pause.  &quot;I&#39;m sure she
told you of the time I spent working at her temple as part of a disguise while
setting up another trap for Sailor Moon and Sailor Mercury.  Quite a feisty
girl, Rei....&quot; he mused before refocusing.  &quot;And later finding out that she
herself was a Sailor Scout was one of the bitterest ironies I&#39;ve encountered in
this life so far.  You tend to remember such things,&quot; he added dryly.
     &quot;So let me get this right....&quot; V said slowly.  &quot;You kept your marbles in
the same bag by fantasizing about bloody vengeance on Sailor Moon, and yet you
turn around and declare her to be super-extra-special in your book?&quot;
     He snorted in contempt.  &quot;That was before I learned that Serena is half-
denizen and that Darian was named Crown Prince of the Negaverse.  Believe me
when I say that immediately put things in a different light.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure it did,&quot; she drawled.
     He looked up at her with a scowl.  &quot;Listen, girl, as much as I hate your
precious Sailor Moon for what she&#39;s done, our society.... our world NEEDS to
have a Queen.  I find it poetic justice that the same girl who killed our Queen
will one day bear the child who will ascend the throne, and in doing so fulfill
our original goal of uniting both our worlds under one hand.&quot;
     She blinked at the realization and frowned.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure I like the way
you said that,&quot; she said in a guarded tone.
     He made a dismissive gesture with his wounded hand.  &quot;Don&#39;t get ahead of
yourself,&quot; he warned.  &quot;This is all mere academic debate if we can&#39;t get her
recognized as Regent.  Then of course there&#39;s the trivial matter of being able
to bear Darian&#39;s child, which we&#39;re still not fully certain of because of her
mixed heritage, to say nothing of what your Imperium Silver Crystal might try
to do about things....&quot;
     She waved her hand in the air.  &quot;Yeah, yeah, I get the picture, dingbat.&quot;
     &quot;Took you long enough,&quot; he groused quietly.
     She sighed and stood up.  &quot;Will you stuff a sock in it already?&quot;
     &quot;Make up your mind,&quot; he shot back with a quiet growl.  &quot;You asked me to
come to this decayed ruin of a building and demanded me to explain myself, but
now you want me to hold my tongue when you don&#39;t like the explanation?&quot;
     She held her breath for a moment before slowly exhaling through her nose.
&quot;Alright, I&#39;ll grant you that much,&quot; she conceded after a moment.  &quot;Tell you
what, why don&#39;t you just sit there and try to look pretty or something for a
few moments?  I have a sudden, burning desire for a cigarette break.  The real
kinker, of course, is that I don&#39;t smoke.&quot;
     He blinked but said nothing as she quietly walked over to the small blue
candle still burning on the forgotten altar.  He watched with remote interest
as she removed her elbow-length white gloves, tucking them in the small red bow
on the back of her skirt before lightly resting her bare fingertips on the slab
of ancient limestone.
     The concept of religion was hardly unknown in the Negaverse, he reflected
as he looked around the church, but it was not exactly a dominant influence in
denizen society.  Unless, he mentally added, you count the NegaForce, in which
case almost everyone becomes rather deeply religious....
     He looked up as she turned around and walked towards him, her otherwise
beautiful face marred by the wrinkled forehead of deep contemplative thought.
&quot;Alright, Jedyt, let&#39;s try it like this,&quot; she said slowly as she slipped her
gloves back on and tugged the wrinkles out.  She paused as she noticed the odd
expression on his face and added, &quot;What?&quot;
     He simply shook his head in reply.  &quot;I think this is the first time I&#39;ve
ever heard you use my name.  Until now, I wasn&#39;t even sure that you knew it.&quot;
     &quot;Give a girl some credit,&quot; she replied with a faint note of dryness.  &quot;Or
did you think we&#39;d be fighting one another for this long without having learned
one another&#39;s name at some point?&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t know your name,&quot; he pointed out.  &quot;And merely &#39;V&#39; doesn&#39;t count.&quot;
     A faint smile touched the corner of her lips.  &quot;That&#39;s right, you don&#39;t
know, do you?  Let that little mystery keep you awake at night,&quot; she teased.
     He decided to skip the bait this time.  &quot;You were saying?&quot;
     She sighed quietly and ran her fingertips through her long blonde hair.
&quot;Just between you and me?  I personally think you&#39;re a scumbag who deserves to
burn in Hell for eternity.  However, I was raised in a Catholic family which
means I&#39;m well-acquainted with concepts like an epiphany and repentance.  So
here&#39;s the deal.... you prove to me that your abandonment of your former ways
is genuine and sincere, and I will speak to the others on your behalf about
letting you be left alone to live your life in relative peace.&quot;
     He grunted as he held up his hand, dark blue blood still oozing out of
the slash in his palm.  &quot;And this wasn&#39;t enough for you?&quot;
     &quot;That merely proves you were serious about Rei,&quot; she countered.  &quot;And a
few drops of blood is nothing.  I&#39;m talking about your whole lifestyle here.
You want to live on Earth?  That&#39;s fine, we&#39;re a friendly society for the most
part.  You&#39;re going to have to adapt to our way of life, however.&quot;
     He nodded.  &quot;That&#39;s a given, but spare me the assimilation speech.  I know
more about this world than you think,&quot; he pointed out.  &quot;Just like I know how
doing something to attract attention would be counter-productive.&quot;
     She smirked.  &quot;Fine, I&#39;ll skip the rhetoric and get to the point.  You&#39;ve
destroyed a lot of stuff in the past, so now it&#39;s time to start fixing that.
You can start by rebuilding this church.&quot;
     Jedyt blinked in surprised and glanced around him, making note of the
general state of decay and neglect of the structure.  &quot;This might take quite
some time,&quot; he cautioned her.  &quot;I&#39;m a general, not a mason or a carpenter.&quot;
     &quot;So learn,&quot; she suggested quietly.  &quot;Learn how to build instead of burn.
Learn how to create instead of destroy.  This church is on holy ground and you
will have to respect that.  Learn the history of this place.... how it got to
be what it was, how it became sanctified, and how to restore that purity.&quot;
     He blinked as he considered her words.  &quot;And what about tools, or raw
materials, or help?  Even a master craftsman can&#39;t always work alone.&quot;
     &quot;Why not return to the Negaverse and make friends with a weaver or two?&quot;
she inquired.  &quot;Explain to them what you want, offer them the chance to eat a
few trees from Earth.... discreetly, of course,&quot; she amended quickly.  &quot;We do
*not* want to hear news reports of crystalline spiders the size of small horses
munching on cherry trees in the city park, now do we?  Very bad for business.&quot;
     He paused as he realized that her idea might be an excellent one to try
to pursue.  &quot;Where am I to stay while this is being done?&quot; he asked, more to
stall for time to think than out of true curiosity.
     She jerked a thumb over her shoulder towards the altar.  &quot;There&#39;s a door
behind the curtain on the left that leads to a small hallway and a few rooms.
Turn them into a modest living area or whatever you want, I don&#39;t really care.
I can go talk to a few people I know, call in a few favors, and see if I can
get the utilities turned on so you can have running water and electricity.  I
might be able to get you a decent mattress for a bed and maybe even a working
toaster, but don&#39;t hold your breath on that last one.&quot;
     He just shook his head.  &quot;You&#39;re serious about this one, aren&#39;t you?&quot;
     She gave him a level gaze.  &quot;Oh, I&#39;m quite serious.  The question is, my
denizen friend, are you serious?&quot;
     &quot;Careful how you use that term,&quot; he grunted quietly.
     &quot;Would you prefer we be at one another&#39;s throats?&quot; she replied.  &quot;If so,
just give the word and we&#39;ll skip this &#39;changing my ways&#39; charade to take care
of unfinished business outside.  Believe me, it would be quite a pleasure.&quot;
     He chuckled quietly.  &quot;Why not settle it in here if you&#39;re so eager?  I
don&#39;t think there&#39;s much left to destroy anyway.&quot;
     She sighed theatrically.  &quot;Remember what I just said about holy ground?
I have no qualms about kicking your butt all the way to your Imperial Castle,
but we&#39;re not fighting in here.  You really should learn about such taboos,&quot;
she added in a tone of mild disapproval.
     He merely grunted quietly in response.  &quot;Tell me exactly why I should put
any sort of trust in you given your blatant hostility towards me.  Why even
bother pretending to want to help me if you&#39;re so eager for my death?&quot;
     &quot;Guess what, Bubbles?  This ain&#39;t about me,&quot; she replied in a low tone.
&quot;Nope, like I said, my personal feelings for you have nothing to do with this
one.  Zilch.  Zero.  Nada.  I&#39;m offering my assistance for two reasons, the
first being because the Catholic in me is saying that offering you chance for
personal redemption is the right thing to do.  To sin is human, or in your case
denizen, and to repent is divine.&quot;
     He raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I think you mangled that quote,&quot; he ventured.
     &quot;Probably, but you get the idea,&quot; she replied with a faint growl.
     &quot;And the second reason?&quot; he prodded.
     She exhaled quietly through her nose.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that the young girl
behind this mask still thinks you&#39;re serious about Rei,&quot; she said in a soft
tone, gesturing to her oversized Sailor V Transformation Glasses.  &quot;I&#39;ll be
honest, I don&#39;t like it much and I&#39;d rather not see anything happen along those
lines, but that&#39;s not a judgment I&#39;m allowed to make.  That&#39;s for Rei to decide
if you&#39;re worth giving the time of day to, let alone this getting-to-know-one-
another nonsense.  I realize that there seems to be some sort of an instant-
attraction bond between certain humans and denizens, and all of those have so
far turned out to be extremely serious relationships so I&#39;m not about to blow
this one off just yet.  Like I said, it&#39;s her call to make, not mine.&quot;
     That caused the denizen to blink.  &quot;So you&#39;ll talk to her?&quot; he inquired
with an audible note of wary hope.
     &quot;Once I&#39;m sure this whole deal isn&#39;t a sham,&quot; she replied.  &quot;You&#39;re being
given a chance, Jedyt, I suggest you make the best of it.&quot;
     He said nothing as she started to walk away from him, heading towards the
large wooden door at the end of the spacious room.  &quot;One moment,&quot; he spoke up
as a thought came to mind.  &quot;We&#39;re not quite done yet.&quot;
     She paused in the middle of the aisle and turned around to face him, a
neutral look on her face.  &quot;Oh, we&#39;re not?&quot; she inquired carefully.  &quot;Do tell.&quot;
     He simply looked at her before holding his hand out expectantly.  &quot;I&#39;ll
give you credit for having k&#39;vesan, despite being a woman, but I&#39;m going to
have to ask you to return the Silkworm crystal you stole from me earlier.&quot;  He
pointedly ignored the triumphant smirk on her face and waited as she made a
show of digging around behind her back.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said simply as the
purple gem was sent sailing through the air in a shallow arc, forcing him to
take a half-step to the side to catch it.
     &quot;I&#39;ll be dropping by from time to time,&quot; she warned him as she turned away
to leave.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I won&#39;t disturb anything or anyone.  And if you need
something, just leave a note out in the open, I&#39;ll find it eventually.  Take
care and stay out of trouble, alright?&quot;
     He waited until she crossed the remaining distance to the door before he
called out to her.  &quot;Sailor V....&quot;
     She paused and cast a wary glance over her shoulder.  &quot;Yes?&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; he said, almost too quietly for her to hear.
     &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; she countered as the door creaked open just enough for her
to slip outside.  The door closed with a soft thump, leaving Jedyt alone with
his uncertain thoughts and with only a small blue candle to guide them.

                *               *               *               *

     Ar&#39;kanis waited for the small conference room doors to fully hiss open
before carefully striding into the room.  &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; he said with a sharp salute
as he saw that Admiral Si&#39;ren was seated at the head of the table.  Two sets
of dinnerware had been laid out by some attendant earlier, accompanied by small
selections of various steaming foodstuffs.
     &quot;General,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied calmly as she gestured to the empty seat with
her fork.  &quot;I trust you&#39;ll forgive me for not waiting, but I would rather not
let dinner grow cold if it can be helped.  That, and I do love fresh fish,&quot; she
added as she gestured to the plate of multi-colored fish fillets.
     &quot;I doubt forgiveness is even an issue under the circumstances,&quot; he said in
a tone of humor that even the echo-effect of his helmet couldn&#39;t obscure.  &quot;I
am grateful for the chance to meet with you again, and I beg your forgiveness
and understanding for regretfully declining to partake in the meal with you.&quot;
     &quot;It is understood,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied simply, casting a sidelong glance at
him as he moved to take the unoccupied seat.  She paused to indulge in another
large bite of the delicately-flavored fish before wiping her mouth on one of
the ornate napkins.  &quot;I will be blunt with you, General, as time seems to be in
unusually short supply today.  I do not see any reason to be rude but I would
like to ask you to dispense with the rigid formalities and speak plainly with
me, one soldier to another.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied with a nod of understanding.  &quot;Nop&#39;tera is
of the mind that her experience and rank is sufficient enough to warrant the
position of Commander-General.  General Rune, obviously, sees it differently.&quot;
     &quot;As do the rest of us,&quot; Si&#39;ren said calmly.  &quot;Rune has the law on her side
in this one, General, there is simply no way General Nop&#39;tera can force Rune to
step aside or yield the position against Rune&#39;s will.  The best she can expect
is the role of a theater commander and as Rune&#39;s executive officer.&quot;
     &quot;Which theater?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired idly.
     Si&#39;ren paused for a moment before spearing another slice of fillet with
her fork.  &quot;Outreaches, certainly,&quot; she said as she chewed thoughtfully.  &quot;I
suppose the Western and Northern commands are negotiable as well.  General Olox
deserves to keep his Southern command, however, and I&#39;m not sure how our good
friend Ra&#39;en in the Eastern division would react to being asked to take a step
back from the reins of command.  The Central Plains division would remain under
General Rune&#39;s direct supervision, of course.&quot;
     &quot;What of the naval regions?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis asked carefully.
     It took an incredible amount of willpower for Si&#39;ren to not swallow her
bite of fish down the wrong pipe.  &quot;Naval regions?&quot; she echoed, looking up to
give him an openly startled look.
     &quot;Though Nop&#39;tera is technically part of an airborne component of the Army,
she has essentially acted as a fleet commodore for centuries with command of
five airborne carriers and thousands of support troops,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis explained in
a careful tone, knowing that he was treading in fairly treacherous waters.  &quot;If
there is room within the Naval command structure, I do not see her being overly
displeased with such a division-level posting.&quot;
     &quot;Bad enough Rune has to watch her back for over-eager officers seeking to
climb the ranks,&quot; Si&#39;ren commented as she took a sip of denizen wine.  &quot;Must I
now be on-guard against Nop&#39;tera&#39;s hunger for power as well?&quot;
     &quot;The idea came to me only moments ago,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied with a bow of his
head.  &quot;I doubt Nop&#39;tera would seek the path of the Admiralty given her beliefs
regarding her current branch of service, but as I said I doubt she would be
displeased should it be offered to her.  As she had confided in me on numerous
occasions, she views herself to be a dedicated servant of both the throne and
the NegaForce.  Should either direct her to change her path, she will do so
without hesitation and with resolved conviction.&quot;
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t comfort me in the slightest,&quot; the admiral pointed out.
     &quot;General Nop&#39;tera may not care for General Rune,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said in a very
careful tone, &quot;But I assure you that she had nothing but the utmost respect for
your position and rank.  Where Rune&#39;s promotion could be seen by some as being
unwarranted, she views your promotion to Fleet Admiral as justly earned and
beyond question.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren raised a delicate white eyebrow as she regarded him carefully in
silence.  &quot;Humor me for a moment,&quot; she said as she reached for another pair of
bright green fish fillets.  &quot;What is so &#39;unwarranted&#39; about Rune&#39;s promotion?&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis remained quiet for a number of moments as he thought carefully.
&quot;Nop&#39;tera has not said this to me in so many words,&quot; he finally spoke up in a
soft rumble, &quot;But she has expressed disappointment and even frustration at the
lack of reliable communications with the Negaverse military during the entirety
of her campaign in the Hinterlands and the Renn homeworld.  She feels that if
the command structure had been more mindful of her service requirements, then
the campaign would not have taken as long as it had and that she would have
been suitable for the role of Commander-General when it was made available.&quot;
     &quot;Is that all?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired lightly, causing him to give her a truly
unsettled look.  &quot;I believe the human expression is &#39;sour grapes&#39;.  There have
been many fine officers in military history who were passed up for promotion
because of their duties elsewhere.  Unfair, perhaps, but since when has life in
any world ever been even remotely fair?  She is not owed anything beyond due
recognition for her services and proper accolades befitting her victories.  She
will recieve those, I assure you,&quot; she added with a somber nod.  &quot;And believe
me, it would be an honor to pin the medals on her myself.  I believe Rune may
have had the same feelings as well before all this.... unpleasantness began.&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis nodded slowly.  &quot;As I said, she seeks to serve the NegaForce as
best she can and I have yet to be given a reason to doubt that the NegaForce
would be better served with her in charge of the military than anyone else.  I
will admit to being biased, of course,&quot; he added calmly with a simple shrug.
     &quot;I&#39;ll give you credit for honesty, General,&quot; Si&#39;ren observed with a faint
note of bemusement.  &quot;But just for the sake of discussion, even if I were to
fully agree with you on every count, the law is still the law and that means
General Rune remains both the Commander-General and General Nop&#39;tera&#39;s superior
in rank and authority by fiat of Royal Decree of Promotion.&quot;
     &quot;And should she be relieved of command for crimes?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired in
a very careful tone.  &quot;Correct me if I am wrong, Admiral, but General Rune is
presently under house arrest, is she not?  If she is relieved of command, then
does not the position of Commander-General become open once again?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren paused and quickly set her glass of wine down before the sudden
spasm in her hand could break the glass or otherwise spill the contents over
her uniform.  &quot;That&#39;s a very dangerous line of thought, General,&quot; she warned in
a somewhat flat tone.  &quot;She presently stands relieved of duty while Internal
Review completes their investigations, but only the throne or a full military
tribunal can relieve her of her rank and authority.  And now that I stop and
think about it.... we might not have enough for a tribunal,&quot; she added as her
blood temperature suddenly cooled.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis inquired in a surprised tone.
     &quot;If Rune is brought before a tribunal and the throne sits empty, we&#39;d need
to form a panel of five active-duty full-rank general officers,&quot; Si&#39;ren said as
she stopped to think about it.  &quot;The branch of service doesn&#39;t matter, just the
rank.  Even if we return Al&#39;vexi to active duty, we still wouldn&#39;t have enough.
The only full-rank general officers we have right now are you, me, Al&#39;vexi,
Rune, Nop&#39;tera, and Admiral K&#39;rel, and Admiral K&#39;rel wouldn&#39;t be medically fit
to stand in judgment due to his health.  Everyone else is a one- or two-star
flag.  Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; she breathed as she sat back in her chair with a truly
unsettled look on her face.  &quot;What happened?&quot;
     Ar&#39;kanis cleared his throat gently.  &quot;You are overlooking General Pra&#39;dek
who is serving as the World Governor for the conquered Renn homeworld.  Even if
he were to be recalled and deemed impartial enough to serve, however, I doubt
either General Nop&#39;tera or myself could sit in judgment on such a tribunal
which would make the whole exercise moot.  As to the answer to your presumably
rhetorical question, Admiral, I believe you are aware of recent events that
have either directly or indirectly led to the loss of the lives of four of
General Rune&#39;s immediate predecessors....&quot;
     &quot;The Sailor Scouts,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she briefly closed her eyes as a
feeling of weariness washed over her.  &quot;Yes, we did manage to go kill off four
of our finest warriors and leaders in that fruitful endeavor, did we not?&quot; she
said in an openly bitter tone.  &quot;To say nothing of dozens of our more talented
agents and soldiers.  That only took what, less than a year to accomplish?  A
self-neutering of both our royal bloodline and our military command?&quot;
     &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis pointed out in a neutral tone.  &quot;I
was not present in the Negaverse during those events.  If I may be so bold, as
we seem to be on the subject of the world called Earth, deciding what to do
about it seems to be the other major point of contention between General Rune
and General Nop&#39;tera.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, I&#39;m aware of Rune&#39;s feelings on the matter,&quot; Si&#39;ren observed in a
dry tone.  She glanced down at her plate for a moment before looking up at him
with a somewhat bemused twinkle in her eye.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose we can settle for
a simple trade-off?&quot; she suggested.  &quot;Nop&#39;tera backs off on the idea of her
becoming the Commander-General in exchange for Rune agreeing in principle to
allow Princess Serena to accede to the throne?&quot;
     A hollow grunt rose up from the depths of Ar&#39;kanis&#39; helmet.  &quot;Were this to
be solely a matter between you and me, I would simply shake your hand and call
it a deal.  Unfortunately, I doubt it will be that simple.  While I may be able
to impress upon Nop&#39;tera the legal realities of her situation, I strongly doubt
she will accept the Moon Princess issue as conditional on anything.  If she has
come to understand that the NegaForce wishes to see her on the throne, even if
only as Regent until the ascension of her daughter, then I simply do not see
Nop&#39;tera accepting any other alternative.  Consequently, she will still need
some form of tangible concession from General Rune in regards to the issue of
command.&quot;
     &quot;So what do you propose, then?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired archly.
     Ar&#39;kanis sat back with a soft creak to ponder the issue carefully.  &quot;Just
so there are no misunderstandings, I am speaking only for myself right now,&quot; he
rumbled slowly.  &quot;If the position of Commander-General were to be vacated and
unable to be filled due to the absence of the monarchy, then that would put
Rune and Nop&#39;tera on fairly even terms in regards to military authority.  Rune
would still remain a theater commander, and Nop&#39;tera will remain the commander
of the Red Wings.  A division, I might add, that we expect to be returned to
the initial authorized strength in terms of personnel and equipment that was
laid down when the Hinterland Campaign began.&quot;
     &quot;A division that reports to whom?&quot; Si&#39;ren prodded as she took a wary sip
of her wine.
     &quot;The throne, just like the rest of the regional divisions do,&quot; the armored
general replied calmly.  &quot;Should a new Commander-General be appointed at some
future date by Royal Decree, then we would of course be subject to his or her
authority as well.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren snorted quietly in contempt and reached for another fillet of fish.
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s all we need,&quot; she pointed out darkly.  &quot;We have a chain of command
just so there are no autonomous military forces running loose on the planet.
And if both Rune and Nop&#39;tera are technically peers who don&#39;t report to any
higher authority....&quot;
     &quot;Begging the Admiral&#39;s pardon,&quot; he interrupted carefully, &quot;I should like
to point out that I am not advocating any such thing.  While the removal of the
Commander-General and the current inability to appoint a new one would create
an even larger power-vacuum than the one that currently exists with the absence
of the monarchy, I should like to point out that the military is not nearly as
leaderless as you would suggest.  There is still one more link in the chain of
command you are overlooking.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren suddenly froze in mid-motion, the forkful of bright blue fish less
than an inch away from her open mouth.  &quot;You must be joking,&quot; she said as she
slowly set her fork down, trying not to shiver as her blood turned icy cold.
     &quot;You are a four-star officer of the Negaverse military,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis pointed
out calmly.  &quot;And while command of a given branch tends to be confined to the
same, it is hardly unheard of for a Naval officer to take command of an Army
organization.  Three-star Army Generals are still very much bound by duty to
obey the orders of a four-star Navy Admiral, are they not?&quot;
     &quot;Let me get this right,&quot; the white-haired admiral said slowly.  &quot;You want
*me* to oversee the entire military while we wait for Prince Darian to take
care of business on his end and give us an heir to the throne?&quot;
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera will listen to you,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied calmly with a slow nod of
his head.  &quot;And if you can moderate the situation between her and Rune in terms
of command and orders, I do not believe she will give you any problems.  In
fact, this may be ideal,&quot; he added as he sat up straight and leaned forward to
carefully rest his armored elbows on the end of the table.  &quot;Consider this....
Rune is allowed to concentrate on the Central Division which will limit any
disruptive influences she may still retain.  Nop&#39;tera will be tasked to handle
the concerns of Prince Darian, which will divert her focus from the military as
an institution.  It would also be explained to Nop&#39;tera that whatever personal
issues she has with Rune are to be considered settled and that any action taken
against Rune, or anyone else for that matter, would be subject to discipline.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren raised a delicate white eyebrow at him as she sat back, absently
taking another sip of wine.  &quot;I don&#39;t see this sitting well with Rune at all,&quot;
she pointed out.  &quot;She loses command of the military and is forced to watch as
the throne is prepared for Sailor Moon.  You spoke earlier of Nop&#39;tera needing
a tangible concession, but now I will have to have something to make the whole
deal seem appealing to Rune.  And having Nop&#39;tera decide not to kill her just
isn&#39;t going to be enough,&quot; she added in a somewhat edged tone.
     The comm-link on Si&#39;ren&#39;s belt suddenly chittered for attention, causing
the admiral to close her eyes and mutter a word with such venom that Ar&#39;kanis
was surprised nothing on the table started to wither or melt from exposure to
the intensity behind the archaic curse.  &quot;Admiral Si&#39;ren,&quot; she managed to say
in a surprisingly calm voice once she retrieved the device and thumbed the
channel open.
     &quot;Ma&#39;am, this is Air Traffic Control,&quot; a voice spoke up.  &quot;You requested to
be notified when your cruiser and flight plan were ready.&quot;
     &quot;That I did,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied with a nod that only Ar&#39;kanis could see.  &quot;I
will be ready to depart in twenty minutes.&quot;
     &quot;Understood, ma&#39;am,&quot; the voice replied.  &quot;Your pilot will be Major Zhen&#39;tu
and she will be waiting for you at West Terminal 2.&quot;
     &quot;Copy.  Si&#39;ren out,&quot; she said as she flicked the device off.  She paused
for a brief instant to debate if she truly wanted to hurl the comm-link against
the wall in simple frustration before sighing heavily and reattaching it to her
belt.  &quot;I never had this problem before,&quot; she muttered darkly, giving Ar&#39;kanis
a look that clearly spoke of her irritation.  &quot;And you want me to have to put
up with this for another thirty years or so?&quot;
     &quot;If you have an alternative suggestion to avoid a conflict between Rune
and Nop&#39;tera,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied lightly, &quot;I assure you I am most interested in
hearing about it and discussing it with you.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren snorted quietly to herself and wiped her mouth on her napkin before
standing up.  &quot;It will have to wait until tomorrow, then,&quot; she said.  &quot;As you
can see, I&#39;ve still got quite a lot to do tonight, and I honestly have no idea
when I&#39;ll be able to get the chance to get some sleep tonight.&quot;
     &quot;Understood perfectly, ma&#39;am,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis said crisply as he too rose to his
feet, coming to rigid attention.
     She paused to regard him carefully before sighing very softly to herself,
absently reaching out to grab the small piece of fish that had been earlier
impaled on her fork.  &quot;Some of your ideas have merit,&quot; she said quietly as she
chewed.  &quot;Others do not.  I am grateful for your willingness to discuss these
matters with me calmly, but as I said, I need something to offer Rune that she
will find appealing enough to offset what you are asking her to give up.  The
issue of Princess Serena becoming our Regent is not nearly as set into stone as
your commander would have us believe.  The key is not her, but Prince Darian.&quot;
     &quot;All the more reason to include him in this discussion,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled
softly.  &quot;I believe Nop&#39;tera would give his words great weight, regardless of
what they might ultimately be.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren nodded and wiped her fingertips on the napkin.  &quot;One day at a time,
General,&quot; she said in a muted tone.  &quot;And for now, the day is not yet over.
Have some fish,&quot; she suggested as she gestured to the half-full plate before
she moved towards the door.  &quot;It should still be warm, and I assure you that
the taste is excellent today.  Fair evening, General Ar&#39;kanis.&quot;
     &quot;Fair evening, Admiral,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied with a salute.  He waited in
silence as the door first hissed open, then subsequently closed behind her
before he turned to regard the table carefully.  What do I offer Rune, indeed?
he found himself thinking as he slowly sat back down at the table.  Nop&#39;tera
will want to keep the Red Wings close to her, and the matter of Princess Serena
is all but settled in her mind.  So what indeed is there to negotiate? he asked
as he removed his helmet, paused to truly smell the aromas wafting up from the
still-warm plate, and reached for the multi-colored pile of fillets.

                *               *               *               *

     Everyone winced slightly as they waited for the harsh electrical glare to
fade away, averting their eyes so as not to be dazzled by the up-close display.
It seemed that the energies persisted for an unusually long time before they
finally vanished, leaving Sailor Jupiter standing in the middle of the room
with her arms stretched out and with a very surprised look on her face.
     &quot;Well?&quot; Uranus prompted carefully.
     Jupiter blinked and flexed her hands slowly before very carefully passing
them over her curvaceous chest.  &quot;Serena?&quot; she said as a blissful look started
to cross her face.  &quot;Don&#39;t take this the wrong way, but I love you.&quot;
     Serena giggled quietly as she continued to cup the Imperium Silver Crystal
in the palm of her hand.  &quot;Does everything fit right?&quot; she asked as she watched
the brunette pat herself down and make a few experimental tugs in a number of
sensitive spots.
     &quot;Oh, yeah,&quot; Jupiter cooed as she reached up to unclip the pink bow on her
chest.  She tossed it onto the back of the couch before running her fingers
along the nearly invisible seam, parting her blouse down to her navel to get a
better look at the dull white bra that had formed during her transformation.
&quot;Yeah, this is nice,&quot; she purred as she gave the straps a slight tug.  &quot;Mina
might not need shoulder straps, but I know I do.  This is wickedly soft, too.
Definitely an improvement.&quot;
     Uranus just shook her head to herself.  &quot;It&#39;s just a suit, hon, no need to
start getting all riled up over it.  Feel better, babe?&quot; she added as Neptune
walked into the room with a faint pink blush on her cheeks.
     &quot;It still chafes slightly,&quot; Neptune admitted, giving Serena an apologetic
look.  &quot;I tried adjusting it, but it&#39;s still cut just a little too steeply.&quot;
     Serena blinked in surprise and glanced down at the gemstone in her hand.
&quot;Er, I.... thought I did what you wanted me to do,&quot; she said slowly.
     &quot;No, you did, your Highness,&quot; Neptune said quickly.  &quot;It&#39;s just rubbing me
a little further back now.&quot;
     Serena nodded in understanding.  &quot;So you want me to try thinning it out a
little bit more?&quot;
     &quot;Hang on a second, babe,&quot; Uranus said as she moved to stand behind the
aquamarine-haired Sailor Scout.  She then brought her hands up to cup Neptune&#39;s
breasts, lightly squeezing and massaging the supersoft flesh through her bra in
a series of gentle rolling motions.
     &quot;Alex!&quot; Neptune gasped, her blush darkening by four shades as she shivered
lightly out of reflex.
     &quot;You know what?&quot; Uranus said as she let go and took a step back, giving
her lover a somewhat amused look.  &quot;I think you put on a little bit of extra
cushiness since the last time you measured yourself.  Try deepening the cup an
inch, your Highness,&quot; she said as she turned to the long-haired blonde.  &quot;That
might ease the strain on the clasp in the back.&quot;
     Serena immediately blushed a fetching shade of pink, giving Neptune a look
of mild embarrassment.  &quot;Ummm, I can try,&quot; she said carefully.  &quot;If that&#39;s what
you want,&quot; she added as she saw the look on Neptune&#39;s face.
     Neptune glanced over at the look on Jupiter&#39;s face before the crimson tint
on her cheeks took on a darker hue.  &quot;You can do that if you think that&#39;s the
problem,&quot; she said in an openly abashed tone.
     Uranus chuckled and stepped forward to kiss her gently.  &quot;Trust me, babe,
I don&#39;t consider a little extra padding to be a problem.  Just means more nice
softness to play with later....&quot;
     &quot;Get a room, girls,&quot; Jupiter sighed as she resealed her blouse and clipped
the chest bow back into place.  &quot;Later,&quot; she added quickly as she remembered
what had happened the last time she made that suggestion aloud.
     &quot;Maybe,&quot; Neptune murmured as she edged away from Uranus and glanced over
at Serena, her cheeks still a vibrant color.  She closed her eyes and turned
her focus inward, her Sailor Suit turning into a shimmering field of water as
she reversed her transformation.  The sea-green liquid splashed to the floor
and evaporated an instant later, leaving Michelle standing with her Power Wand
tucked in one hand.
     &quot;So how&#39;d it go?&quot; Jupiter called out as Pluto exited the stairwell where
she had been stress-testing some of the modifications to her own Sailor Suit.
     &quot;Exceedingly well,&quot; Pluto replied with a smile as she fluffed her wings
out.  &quot;There was some resistance at first, of course, but the suit tore along
the perforations as expected.  The other adjustments are performing as intended
as well, so I must say that this endeavor has been quite successful.  Or at
least it has been for me,&quot; she added in a faintly guarded tone as she noticed
the look on Michelle&#39;s face.
     &quot;It just needs another minor adjustment,&quot; Michelle muttered as she glanced
away and continued to blush fairly hard.
     &quot;I&#39;m working on it,&quot; Serena assured her as she closed her eyes and began
to concentrate, wordlessly directing her will into the Crystal to communicate
her desires.
     Jupiter just shook her head.  &quot;Settle down, it&#39;s nothing to get all bent
out of shape over,&quot; she said to Michelle.  She suddenly paused and winced as
the pun hit her, adding, &quot;Such as it were,&quot; in a sheepish tone.
     &quot;I know,&quot; Michelle replied with a faint sigh.  &quot;It&#39;s just.... still....
one of those things,&quot; she managed to say without blushing any harder.
     &quot;Might I inquire as to the nature of the problem?&quot; Pluto asked carefully
as she stepped over to join the group.
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Uranus chuckled as she winked at Michelle.  &quot;Mich here just needs
more space up front since she&#39;s gotten a little lusher on me....&quot;
     &quot;Alex....&quot; Michelle hissed in a strangled tone, giving Pluto a look that
clearly conveyed her embarrassment at the subject.
     &quot;C&#39;mon,&quot; Jupiter sighed as she looked up at the ceiling.  &quot;I&#39;m all for
teasing the hell out of your lover at various points in time, but now you&#39;re
just being mean.  Hell, that could be simple water retention,&quot; she added as she
tapped her hand against the underside of her own breast.  &quot;Trust me, that can
have an influence some days if you&#39;ve got a tight-fitting bra that was measured
awhile ago.&quot;
     &quot;A very valid point,&quot; Pluto agreed with a nod.
     The conversation came to a halt as the sign of the Moon began to glow on
Serena&#39;s forehead, flickering gently like a candle in a slight breeze.  &quot;Cosmic
Moon Power....&quot; she intoned as she held the Imperium Silver Crystal up towards
Michelle.
     Michelle closed her eyes as her sigil lit up like a flare, a soft gasp of
awe and wonder rising up from her chest as the wave of energy swept through her
elemental spirit.  The aquamarine mark on her forehead faded several moments
later, both Michelle and Serena opening their eyes at the same time as the
Crystal became quiescent once again.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Michelle murmured as she gave Serena a warm smile, drawing a
smile and a nod of understanding in return.  She then took a step away from the
group and held her Power Wand up towards the ceiling.  &quot;Neptune Power!&quot; she
called out.
     Uranus chuckled quietly to herself and idly scratched her cheek as she
watched the familiar geyser of sea-green water erupt from the floor to briefly
conceal Michelle.  &quot;One of these days, I&#39;m going to have to see if I can&#39;t get
her to shampoo the carpet when she does that.  I mean, why let all that water
go to waste?&quot;
     &quot;Your carpet or hers?&quot; Jupiter inquired idly, her off-color comment almost
causing Serena to drop the Crystal in shock.
     &quot;Lady Jupiter....&quot; Pluto said with a heavy sigh.
     The wall of water drained away, leaving behind a somewhat unamused Sailor
Neptune.  &quot;Ahem,&quot; she said primly as she continued to glare at Jupiter.
     &quot;Settle down, I&#39;m just harassing you guys,&quot; Jupiter sighed as she looked
up at the ceiling.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Uranus said dismissively before she turned back to look over
Neptune&#39;s newly-reconstituted suit.  &quot;So how&#39;s it feel this time, hon?&quot;
     Neptune blinked and glanced down at the front of her blouse, her eyebrows
arching up slightly as she started to roll her shoulders.  &quot;Hmmm....&quot; she said,
the sound emerging from her throat as more of a squeak than a hum.
     &quot;A little extra space does wonders like that,&quot; Jupiter observed as she
started to stretch, visibly putting a moderate amount of tension on the front
of her blouse.  &quot;Oooh,&quot; she protested after a few moments as she felt the way
the straps were digging into her skin under the strain.
     &quot;Likewise,&quot; Uranus muttered as she eyed the now-prominent outline of
Jupiter&#39;s bra as the fabric continued to remain dangerously taut.  &quot;You might
want to ease off before you hurt someone with that.&quot;
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Jupiter said as she paused in mid-stretch before lowering her arms
slightly, just enough to ease the worst of the tension.
     Uranus just shrugged in dismissal before returning her focus to the way
Neptune was poking and prodding the new changes to her Sailor Suit.  &quot;I&#39;m just
saying bras are dangerous.&quot;
     &quot;How so?&quot; Serena spoke up in a very guarded tone, clearly unsure if she
really wanted to hear the answer.
     &quot;Just imagine what would happen if Leda went to stretch like that again
and the clasp in the back popped,&quot; Uranus replied with another shrug.  &quot;Might
put someone&#39;s eye out when her tits suddenly flopped forward, you know?&quot;
     Jupiter and Pluto just traded weary looks before the brunette shook her
head in resignation.  &quot;Tell you what, girl,&quot; Jupiter muttered as she moved over
to the coffee table to collect her schoolbooks.  &quot;We&#39;ll let you know if that
ever happens to anyone.  I still think you&#39;re jealous of those of us who have
something for the guys to look at from a distance, but I&#39;m not going to make an
issue of it if you won&#39;t.&quot;
     A truly derisive snort rose up from Uranus&#39; chest.  &quot;Tell me again why I&#39;d
want some punk leering at my tits to begin with?&quot; she inquired darkly.
     &quot;You&#39;ll understand one of these years,&quot; Jupiter replied dryly as she put
her homework into a folder and stuffed it into her backpack.  &quot;In any case, I
really wouldn&#39;t worry about it if I were you.  All bad jokes aside, it really
isn&#39;t the size of whatever on whomever that counts but the depth and sincerity
of the emotions between you.  Serena, do you think you&#39;ll need me to cough up
a few thousand volts anytime soon, or can I change back now?&quot; she added as she
cast a questioning look over at the long-haired blonde.
     Serena blinked in surprise at the question before shaking her head.  &quot;No,
you can go ahead and change,&quot; she replied.  &quot;And if something does need to be
zapped with your thunder, I think we&#39;ll all know about it.&quot;
     &quot;Just saying,&quot; Jupiter replied with a dismissive shrug as she continued to
load up her backpack with her homework.  She paused for a moment to turn her
focus inward, reversing her transformation with another dazzling display of
electrical energy to leave her wearing her school uniform again.
     &quot;Speaking of change, Serena,&quot; Pluto spoke up carefully, &quot;If you are going
to return home to your Earth-born parents, you may wish to change back into
your school uniform in order to avoid any undue interest or speculation as to
why your attire has changed.&quot;
     &quot;Oops,&quot; Serena said as she glanced down at the blouse and jeans she was
wearing.  &quot;Almost forgot about that.  Thanks, I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; she promised
as she quickly made her way into the residential corridor.
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Leda chuckled quietly as she zipped her backpack shut.  &quot;You beat
me to the punch by about five seconds.  Her parents are pretty cool and all, so
I don&#39;t think they would have said anything.  Hell, with as much time as she
spends hanging around here with the rest of us, I&#39;d be surprised if they even
would have noticed.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Pluto allowed in a faintly guarded tone.  She closed her eyes
briefly as she concentrated to first absorb her wings, then reverse her own
transformation in a veil of dark fog that quickly dissipated into nothingness.
&quot;However, with the situation currently being what it is, I would prefer not to
run any unnecessary risks of exposure.  Granted I am somewhat.... relieved to
know that your respective situations with your respective families is enough to
deter or otherwise avoid casual questions about your alter egos, but at the
same time I am still of the firm belief that it will only be a matter of time
before you are forced to reveal yourselves to them.&quot;
     Leda snorted to herself and absently crossed her arms.  &quot;I don&#39;t have a
family, other than you guys,&quot; she pointed out darkly, causing both Uranus and
Neptune to blink hard.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s kinda nice not being told
what to do or when, but at the same time I need to be on my toes all the time
instead of kicking back and letting a parent handle something important like
bills or grocery shopping.&quot;
     A small whirlwind surrounded Uranus for a moment as she reversed her own
transformation, coming dangerously close to scattering sea-green water in all
directions as Neptune likewise started to transform back in the same instant.
&quot;Run this one past me again, hon,&quot; Alex said in a leery voice as she absently
slid her arm around Michelle&#39;s waist.  &quot;What happened to set you up like that?
Hey,&quot; she added softly as she realized that Michelle was hugging her fairly
tightly.
     Leda sighed quietly and looked up at the ceiling.  &quot;My parents died two
years ago in a plane crash,&quot; she said in a somewhat flat tone.  &quot;A friend of
my father&#39;s knew what kind of person I was and offered to cut me a deal about
what my life would be like.  I agreed, he did some behind-the-scenes work to
set things up so I was largely self-sufficient, we both kept in touch and life
went on.  I don&#39;t talk about it unless I have to,&quot; she added in a faintly edged
tone as she turned her attention back to Alex and Michelle.  &quot;That way, nobody
starts asking questions and tries to make his own life difficult for what he
did for me.  It&#39;s worked quite well for the past two years, and it just needs
to keep going smoothly until I turn eighteen and can then take full legal
responsibility for everything without needing any intervention.&quot;
     Susan cleared her throat delicately before speaking up.  &quot;If I may, Leda,
what precisely were the terms of this deal you made with your benefactor?  I
would hope that it wouldn&#39;t be anything.... unethical....&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t even go there,&quot; the brunette growled with enough indignation to
make Michelle take a half-step back and cause both Susan and Alex to blink.
&quot;It&#39;s a simple financial and legal understanding and absolutely nothing more.
I know the guy quite well, his wife is one of the sweetest ladies I&#39;ve ever
met, he&#39;s got two grandkids right now, and if you&#39;re trying to insinuate that
he would even *think* about laying a hand on me....&quot;
     &quot;Whoa, whoa, whoa, settle down, girl,&quot; Alex said carefully as she edged
herself forward half a step to shield Michelle from Leda&#39;s sudden temper.  &quot;I
think we all get the picture that you found yourself a white knight and that
all is well with the world.  I&#39;m pretty sure Sue wasn&#39;t trying to suggest that
you were giving him any favors or anything like that....&quot;
     &quot;Indeed I was not,&quot; Susan said with a slight bow of her head.  &quot;Forgive me
if I seemed to suggest otherwise, Leda, as I was merely trying to make sure
that he wasn&#39;t taking advantage of you.&quot;
     &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; Leda grunted quietly as she exhaled slowly.  &quot;Like I said, he&#39;s
done quite a lot to keep my life straight since my parents died, the least of
which was keeping me out of foster care, so sorry if I get all edgy when people
start to suggest he&#39;s got ulterior motives.  He doesn&#39;t.  All he is is my legal
guardian on paper, and I make damn sure that his task of &#39;guarding&#39; me is made
as painless as possible.  If something truly heinous goes down I know he&#39;ll be
able to step in to help, but otherwise my life is essentially my own to run as
I see fit.  Michelle, you look like you&#39;re ready to cry,&quot; she added, her voice
softening as she saw the look on her face.
     Michelle glanced up at Alex before sighing heavily and leaning against her
for support.  &quot;It&#39;s just that.... our parents are dead too now,&quot; she said in a
muted voice.  &quot;My parents, Alex&#39;s mother, the rest of Queen Serenity&#39;s Sailor
Scouts....&quot;
     &quot;C&#39;mon, Mich,&quot; Alex said softly as she wrapped her in a gentle embrace.
&quot;Let&#39;s not get started on that one again, okay?  I mean.... well.... shoot,&quot;
she huffed as she closed her eyes.  &quot;Now you got me thinking about it....&quot;
     Leda glanced up towards the hallway as Serena returned, wearing her school
uniform and with the golden brooch securely fastened to the chest bow.  &quot;Hey,&quot;
she said quietly by way of greeting.  &quot;You about ready to head on out?&quot;
     &quot;Umm, almost,&quot; Serena said in an uneasy tone as she realized that Michelle
was quietly crying to herself and that Alex looked like she was considering it
as well.  &quot;Wait, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked cautiously.
     &quot;Nothing, starlight,&quot; Alex spoke up before anyone else could.  &quot;Just a few
stray memories of the past biting us in the butt again.  We&#39;ll manage.&quot;
     Leda sighed heavily as she hefted her backpack onto her shoulder.  &quot;Just
be glad you&#39;ve got a family to go home to, Serena,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;Yeah,
I know I make a big deal out of being independent and all, but it still sucks
some days when you go home to an empty apartment at the end of the day.  Hey,
speaking of which, you guys want to come spend the night at my place?&quot; she
asked purely on impulse as she turned back to Alex and Michelle.  &quot;I&#39;ve got a
spare room you can use with clean sheets and all, and lord knows I could use
the company right now.&quot;
     Both Alex and Michelle blinked hard at the sudden offer.  &quot;Wait, you want
us to do what with your sheets?&quot; Alex said in a brief moment of confusion.
     &quot;Just thought I&#39;d offer,&quot; Leda replied with a shrug of dismissal.  &quot;You
know, so none of us have to really be alone tonight.  Not that you two seem to
have that problem, mind you, but I&#39;m just saying....&quot;
     &quot;Leda, we&#39;d love to,&quot; Michelle said, visibly perking up.  She glanced over
at Alex before resting her head on her shoulder.  &quot;And I promise we won&#39;t make
a mess of anything.&quot;
     A dry chuckle rose up from the brunette&#39;s throat as she gave the other
girl an amused look.  &quot;Believe me, I&#39;m going to hold you to that promise, too,&quot;
she teased.
     A gentle smile merely touched the edges of Susan&#39;s lips.  &quot;I doubt that
you will have much to worry about, Leda,&quot; she said.  &quot;And I do thank you for
making the offer.  Getting out to see the city from another perspective should
be educational for both Alex and Michelle, even if it is only something as
mundane as a walk from here to your apartment complex.&quot;
     &quot;Whoa, wait,&quot; Alex protested as she alternated her gaze between the look
in Michelle&#39;s eyes and the expression on Susan&#39;s face.  &quot;Sue, what are we being
dragged into this time?&quot;
     &quot;Hey, you don&#39;t have to come with me if you don&#39;t want to,&quot; Leda spoke up
before Susan could reply.  &quot;I just thought I&#39;d ask for some company tonight
given the mood and all.  Besides, I figured it&#39;d be easier to go as a group
since Serena&#39;s house is pretty much on the way home and all, and I don&#39;t have
any problems making a ten-block detour for her.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, okay,&quot; Alex replied casually as she finally grasped the situation.
&quot;Sure, that&#39;s cool.  Umm, give us a moment to pack a bag or something?&quot; she
added as she traded glances with Michelle.
     &quot;Go for it,&quot; Leda said as she slipped her backpack off and set it back
down on the table.
     &quot;Thanks, babe, we&#39;ll be right back,&quot; the short-haired blonde promised as
she and Michelle promptly headed towards the residential wing of the cathedral.
     &quot;Took her long enough,&quot; Leda muttered under her breath to Serena, drawing
a faint giggle from her and a mild look from Susan.  &quot;I was worried I was going
to have to break out the crayons in order to a draw a picture that she could
understand.&quot;
     &quot;You should not be so harsh in your judgments of Alex&#39;s mental faculties,&quot;
Susan said in a gentle tone.  &quot;While I will be the first to admit she is not
nearly as.... how shall I phrase it.... intuitionally fortified as someone like
Ami or myself, her heart and soul are nonetheless in the proper place.  All she
needs is proper guidance and a measure of patience.&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Leda chuckled quietly to herself.  &quot;If you&#39;re trying to scrounge up
spare patience like it was pocket change, you&#39;d have better luck checking under
the couch cushions instead of looking at me.  Lord knows I&#39;ve got my own issues
with needing to be patient for a lot of things.&quot;
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Serena muttered softly to herself.
     &quot;Oh, don&#39;t start, meatball head,&quot; the brunette huffed, giving the blonde
a look of only partial amusement.  &quot;The only ones in this motley crew who has
patience to spare are Ami and Rei, and sometimes even Rei comes up short a few
pennies, so I don&#39;t want to hear it since you don&#39;t have much room to talk.&quot;
     &quot;I know,&quot; Serena grumbled quietly as she looked away, sighing softly after
a few moments.  She glanced over at the hallway as Alex and Michelle came back
to join them with a small bag-like container slung over Alex&#39;s shoulder.
     &quot;Alright, we&#39;re set,&quot; Alex announced.
     &quot;That was unusually expedient,&quot; Susan commented in a fairly neutral tone.
     &quot;Bah,&quot; the Viking countered with a wave of her hand.  &quot;It&#39;s just a short
overnight trip, Sue.  Clean underwear and those toiletry kits you picked up for
us.  We figured we can change once we get back here in the morning.  And if we
have to, we can just mooch something from Leda&#39;s closet until then.&quot;
     Leda shrugged to herself as she picked her backpack up again and slung it
over her shoulder.  &quot;That&#39;ll work,&quot; she commented.  &quot;It&#39;ll probably look baggy
on either of you, but nobody&#39;ll really care.  Everyone set?&quot; she added as she
cast a quick glance at Serena.
     &quot;I&#39;m ready,&quot; Serena replied with a nod.
     &quot;I would advise all of you to travel carefully,&quot; Susan spoke up as she
absently brushed her fingertips through her mane of dark green hair.  &quot;Granted
it is unlikely you will encounter any hazards or dangers in a group, but you
should nonetheless maintain a vigil for any such possibilities.&quot;
     A wry smirk brushed against the edges of Leda&#39;s lips.  &quot;We&#39;ll be alright,&quot;
she assured the succubus.  &quot;And believe me, if something does go down we&#39;ll be
sure to give you a buzz on the communicator.  Speaking of which,&quot; she added as
she heard a muted chirping noise start up.
     &quot;Not mine,&quot; Serena protested as she cocked her head at a slight angle,
listening to the pitch and tone of the beep.
     &quot;Excuse me,&quot; Susan said as she retrieved her communicator from her Lunar
Space pocket and took a step away from the group.
     &quot;Typical,&quot; Alex muttered as she shook her head.  &quot;See you in the morning,
Sue.  Let&#39;s go,&quot; she added as the rest of the group started to head for the
front door of the cathedral.
     &quot;Indeed, sleep well, all of you,&quot; Susan replied absently as she studied
the display of her communicator for a moment.  She carefully brushed her thumb
over the blinking orange Venus icon and was rewarded with the image of Sailor
V appearing in the tiny display area.  &quot;Good evening,&quot; she said carefully, not
entirely sure why she was being contacted.
     &quot;Hey, spooky lady,&quot; V said with an overly cheerful smile that was belied
by the openly stormy look in her bright blue eyes.  &quot;We need to talk....&quot;
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound good,&quot; Leda muttered very quietly to Serena as they
left the cathedral.
     Alex cast a visibly disturbed glance over her shoulder an instant before
Michelle closed the door behind them.  &quot;Hey, question.... does Mina always
sound like she ate a lemon when she&#39;s got that other costume on, or should I
be worried what&#39;s going on?&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s Sailor V,&quot; both Leda and Serena said in the same instant with nearly
identical sighs of resignation.
     &quot;Right,&quot; Alex replied slowly, trading unsettled looks with Michelle and
getting a helpless shrug in return.
     &quot;Trust me, you&#39;ll get used to her,&quot; Leda explained.  &quot;And like we just got
done telling Susan, if something does go down on V&#39;s watch, she&#39;ll be sure to
let us know about it.  C&#39;mon, this way,&quot; she said as they started down the long
gravel path that connected the cathedral&#39;s hidden sanctuary to the rest of the
outside world.  &quot;Okay, Serena, time to see if you remember what we told you.
If I give you an algebra equation that starts with x-squared....&quot;


                *               *               *               *

     Rei looked up impassively as her grandfather gingerly eased himself into
a sitting position in front of the fireplace.  The movement didn&#39;t appear to be
any more difficult or labored than before, but she nonetheless got the very
distinct impression that he was more than a little weary tonight.
     &quot;So how goes the shellfish studying?&quot; he asked in a fairly amused tone as
he made himself comfortable and indulged in a brief moment of meditation out of
simple habit.
     The softest of grunts rose up from Rei&#39;s chest as she reflected on what
she felt she had actually accomplished with her studies earlier.  &quot;I think I
know how to take them apart in a lab now,&quot; she spoke up, trying not to let her
distaste show at the notion of having to physically dissect them.
     &quot;Such confidence,&quot; he mused gently, cracking one eye open to give her a
somewhat careful look.
     It took the priestess a considerable amount of self-control to not roll
her eyes at the casual prod.  &quot;Looking at a picture drawn in a book is a lot
different than having the same object sitting in your hand,&quot; she pointed out.
     &quot;True,&quot; he admitted as he closed his eye and sighed softly.  &quot;As I said
earlier, your Biology grades could use a little improvement, but at the same
time they are far from being considered deplorable, so I will not press the
issue too strongly.  Just make sure to take the right kind of cucumber sauce
in with you when you go to eat them afterwards,&quot; he added with a chuckle.
     &quot;Thanks,&quot; Rei muttered sourly as her stomach briefly twitched at the idea.
     &quot;You&#39;re doing fine, Rei,&quot; her grandfather said quietly, sounding more like
he was speaking to himself than to her.  He opened his eyes to stare into the
burning heart of the fireplace, his gaze becoming unfocused after a few moments
as his mind turned inward.  &quot;Surely you know how important it is for you to be
fully educated now, when you are young and have your future ahead of you, than
when you get to be my age and find yourself limited by ignorance.&quot;
     Rei blinked but remained silent, knowing that her grandfather rarely spoke
of himself in even the most casual of senses.  She realized that he was trying
to work himself up to telling her about the messages they had both received
earlier in the day and the stories behind them, but that it clearly wasn&#39;t an
easy thing for him to do.
     His gaze might have glanced up to her for a brief instant before falling
back down to the firepit quietly burning away between them.  The orange and
yellow coloring of the fire seemed to reflect off of his face in an unusual
way tonight, not so much giving him a hellish cast as making him seem to be far
older than what he really was.  Or at least what Rei thought was his age.
     The faintest of heavy whispers brushed her ears as he finally drew in a
deep enough breath to speak.  &quot;I would ask that you not repeat any of this to
anyone else for any reason,&quot; he murmured softly, almost too softly for her to
hear.  &quot;I have always viewed an individual&#39;s past to be their own personal and
private business, a veil of privacy I have always sought to respect, and I only
speak of my own tonight to answer the questions that you now.... deserve to
have answered.&quot;
     Rei blinked silently at the obvious hesitation to his words, giving her
the impression that he felt she still didn&#39;t &#39;deserve&#39; to hear the answers to
her questions.  She wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it, but decided that now was
not the time to inquire or press him about it in even the slightest way.
     &quot;As with all stories,&quot; he continued in a quiet, almost whispering voice
that threatened to be lost amid the gentle crackling of the fire, &quot;It is best
to start in the beginning.  In this case, I will start with my own introduction
to the Order of Light.
     &quot;I was born to a pair of poor farmers in a very remote and rural province
of China, bordering the mountainous region called Tibet.  The region was prone
to seasonal droughts which often made life very difficult, and it seems that I
had the misfortune of being born just after the start of an unusually long era
of parched fields and dying crops.
     &quot;Famine hit the region when I was four, and with the harvest being barely
worth the effort of collecting I was sent to a local monastery in the hopes
that I would be better taken care of in their service.  I remember waving to my
parents as they left, not realizing that it would be the last time I ever saw
them again.  The drought continued, and eventually the famine claimed all but
a handful of sparse villages,&quot; he whispered sadly.
     &quot;My life in the monastery was not easy.  We had enough food for our own
needs, though barely sometimes and not without a cost.  I had to perform work
for them, of course, even at my young age as everyone needed to do their part
to ensure there was enough for all to eat in the monastery.  The labor was such
that it was both strenuous and burdensome to all without being back-breaking,
and yet still remained fair in terms of the way it was divided according to an
individual&#39;s ability.  We had no measurable wealth in even the slightest sense,
being quite literally dirt-poor in every respect.  We remained alive due to our
organization and self-sustaining ways when so many were neither, however, and
to us that was worth more than all the riches in the land.
     &quot;I was ten years old when an emissary from the Order of Light came to the
monastery,&quot; he continued in a quiet, almost withered voice.  &quot;It was said that
it had been the first visit from them in almost thirty years, and all of the
elders were excited about it.  Not openly so, of course, but you could tell in
their eyes and the way they spoke about it that they were both grateful and
deeply humbled.  I remember there was a bit of a fuss about making sure our
robes were freshly cleaned and properly mended so that there wouldn&#39;t be any
dishonor cast upon our monastery.  At the time I laughed on the inside,&quot; he
added with a muted chuckle.  &quot;Here we were, as impoverished as we could be and
yet still worried about appearing correctly before others in faded yellow and
orange linens that were probably older than half of our number.&quot;
     &quot;You were Shaolin?&quot; Rei spoke up quietly before she could stop herself.
She flinched fairly hard on the inside an instant later, not believing she had
interrupted her grandfather like that and praying that it wouldn&#39;t anger him
enough to cease telling her about his past like this.
     A quiet snort of derision rose up from his chest as he stared into the
burning embers of the fire.  &quot;Not in the sense that most people think of these
days.  Most TV and movies depicted Shaolin monks as inhumanly-skilled martial
artists who could stop an army with a stick they picked up walking through a
local forest.  Yes, we had a few dedicated practitioners of the art among us
who taught us to keep us physically fit and help guide our thoughts when we
needed to search inward for our answers, but never did it approach anything
remotely depicted in those low-grade Hollywood movies you see in the stores.&quot;
     Rei kept her gaze downcast as she heard the muted grumblings of discontent
from him, knowing that she really shouldn&#39;t have spoken up like that.  Great,
she thought dourly to herself, bad enough I was picking up on Serena&#39;s emotions
in class earlier, but now I&#39;m picking up on her bad habits too.  If this keeps
up, I might have to kill her again myself just for some peace and quiet....
     &quot;In any regard,&quot; he finally continued quietly after a short stretch of
heavy silence, &quot;We all made ourselves as presentable as we could be and lined
up to receive the emissary from the Order of Light.  When I actually saw him
for myself, I remember feeling a little disappointed because he appeared to be
no different than any of us were, save for the fact that his robes were in far
better condition.
     &quot;I honestly don&#39;t remember what the elders said to him, or what he said to
the elders about his visit, but I do remember the look of shock on their faces
at one point.  Shortly afterwards, he began to walk among us, speaking to each
of us in turn.  His voice was.... quiet,&quot; he murmured distantly, his gaze all
but vacant as he stared into both the fire and into the dark recesses of his
past memories.  &quot;I remember hearing him speak to the boy next to me, but I was
unable to make out what he said.  When he came to me and looked me in the eye,
it was like the world around me suddenly vanished.  For those few brief moments
he was focused on me, it was as if he and I were the only ones in the entire
universe.  All he said to me was, &#39;The clouds in your mind are thick now, but
you more than anyone here will be able to see through them soon.  Remain strong
and endure until we are ready for you.&#39;  And with that he turned away from me
to speak to the next boy in line.&quot;
     A very soft yet heavy sigh rose up from him as he closed his eyes, the
normally calm lines of his aged face seeming to smooth out for one brief moment
in time to give him the appearance of a man a third his age.  The illusion of
youth vanished an instant later, leaving behind the weather-worn mien of one
who had lived for what appeared to be a full seventy years if not longer.
     &quot;He left shortly afterwards,&quot; the quiet voice finally spoke up after what
felt to Rei like a minor eternity had passed.  &quot;His words made little sense to
me, but I couldn&#39;t bring myself to speak to any of the others about what he had
said to me.  For all but the elders, his visit was forgotten with the span of
a week as we returned to our chores and rigid duties of survival in a place
where the earth itself struggled to remain alive.  It would be another ten
years before I would be reminded of the emissary&#39;s words, for that was when he
returned to our monastery for a second visit, just before the winter chills
began to set in with icy earnest.  Only this time, I was asked to accompany him
to the west on his journey home, into the imposing shadow of Shishma Pangma to
study with the Order of Light as the newest pupil of the Tulku.&quot;
     He fell silent for a number of moments, continuing to stare into the core
of the fire before sighing silently and drawing in another breath to continue.
&quot;The elders were both awed and excited that I had been chosen, though for what
I had yet to fully grasp at that point.  I nonetheless accepted their quiet
congratulations and tried to remember their whispered admonishments about how
I was to conduct myself during my stay with the Order.  The emissary spent the
night with us at the monastery and without any unusual fanfare or ceremony.  I
thought that to be odd, being a distinguished and revered guest, but he laid on
a thin mat on the bare earth like the rest of us without a second thought.
     &quot;The evening meal that night was no different, but the morning meal the
next day was rather hearty compared to the usual portions we were allotted for
breakfast.  It was the first time in my life I could remember being too full to
eat anything more, and you have to keep in mind that I was age twenty by that
point.  I decided that it was their way of both celebrating and seeing us off
on a long journey, dipping into our meager stores like that, which only further
impressed upon me a feeling of uncertainty about my fate and the future.
     &quot;In due course, the emissary and I left the monastery and started walking
with nothing more than the clothes on our backs and a simple cloth sack each
holding a wooden cup, an earthen jug of water, and a small loaf of bread.  We
walked for six days,&quot; he added in an even quieter whisper.  &quot;We only stopped to
sleep at sunset and were walking again by sunrise.  Somehow both the bread and
the water lasted until we reached another monastery further west, where we were
able to refill the jugs and were given another loaf of bread.  After that, it
only took us a single day to reach the base of the mountains, and four more of
navigating steep mountain paths to finally reach.... an empty plateau.&quot;
     Rei blinked, more in response to the change in her grandfather&#39;s tone than
to the unexpected discovery of nothing at the end of the journey.  She was in
the process of drawing in a breath to ask him a question when she changed her
mind at the last instant, deciding it was better not to interrupt him again.
     &quot;The emissary then turned to me and asked me what I saw.  When I said that
I saw nothing, he merely shook his head and gestured to the empty distance.
&#39;There are still clouds in your mind,&#39; he said quietly.  &#39;You must learn to
look past them if you are to truly see with open eyes.  We will remain here
until the Tulku is ready.&#39;  And with that he sat down and began to meditate.
     &quot;Not knowing what else to do, I sat beside him and stared at the empty
terrain,&quot; he sighed quietly.  &quot;Mountains are pretty from a distance, but when
you get close enough to climb them they are nothing more than large rocks and
occasional patches of scrub brush.  The air was clear but thin, making me feel
just a touch light-headed.  A haze started to form around us, and at the time
I couldn&#39;t tell if it was just me or a passing cloud being snagged.  Then all
of a sudden, everything changed.
     &quot;I remember jumping to my feet as the temple appeared out of nowhere, a
towering edifice of stone and bronze and iron that seemed to be part of the
mountain peak itself.  I could not speak, I was so amazed and awed by it, not
just by the beauty or richness of the temple but of the fact that it hadn&#39;t
been there a moment ago.  Or so I had thought.
     &quot;The emissary calmly got to his feet and looked at me as if nothing had
changed.  He spoke to me before I could remember how to move my tongue again,
simply saying, &#39;The clouded mind sees nothing.  Remember that,&#39; before moving
towards the great bronze doors that were starting to swing open.&quot;
     It took Rei a considerable amount of effort to keep her own tongue still,
having a dozen questions she wanted to ask her grandfather but not wanting to
dispel the current mood of reminiscence and wonder.  She instead settled for a
simple nodding of her head, not aware that her grandfather wasn&#39;t paying any
attention and wouldn&#39;t readily notice the subtle gesture.
     &quot;There must have been fifty or sixty monks lining the hall as we made our
way inside,&quot; he continued after another lengthy pause, his visage seeming to
briefly become youthful once again before returning to normal.  &quot;Each dressed
in finely-crafted and well-woven robes that made me quite self-conscious of the
tattered rags I was wearing.  They said nothing as we passed, merely bowing
their heads in respect.  We reached a beaded curtain where the emissary stopped
and gestured for me to enter before bowing his head and turning back down the
hallway.  I will readily admit to being more than a little fearful at that
point, but I somehow found the courage to reach out to part the curtain and
enter the room.&quot;
     Rei blinked hard as her grandfather started to chuckle very softly to
himself, seeming to be more nervous laughter than actual amusement.  She was
about to ask a question about the temple when he looked up at her, resulting in
a somewhat uneasy tingle shooting throughout her entire body.  She managed to
keep her expression perfectly impassive, but her spiritual senses continued to
twitch for several moments before finally calming down.
     &quot;You felt that, I trust?&quot; he murmured quietly to her.
     &quot;I did,&quot; Rei replied carefully after a moment of hesitation, wondering
what the hell he had just done a moment ago.  It wasn&#39;t anything she could ever
remember feeling before, making her wonder if it was something new that he had
yet to teach her or otherwise demonstrate.
     He nodded slowly in understanding before sighing and returning his focus
to the fire, his appearance once again seeming to flicker for the briefest of
instants with ageless youth.  &quot;That is what I felt when I first met the Tulku,
or at least the one of my generation,&quot; he added.  &quot;It is said that the Tulkus
are holy wisdoms who reincarnate themselves generation after generation so that
they can continue training their students and followers.  I cannot say for sure
if that is ultimately true or not, but the feeling I got when I first saw the
Tulku was that he was indeed ageless beyond years.  And yet he appeared to be
no older than I was,&quot; he murmured as he closed his eyes.
     &quot;Grandpa....&quot; Rei started to say without thinking before abruptly shutting
her mouth.
     &quot;I will not relate the exact details of our introduction,&quot; he continued in
a soft and audibly weary voice.  &quot;Suffice it to say that he informed me that I
had a latent gift that not many other men had, an ability that he would teach
me how to use to its fullest extent.  Or at least that was his intention,&quot; he
added in a faintly bitter tone.
     &quot;You might call it a gift of influence over others,&quot; he continued as he
continued to keep his eyes closed.  &quot;They called it the ability to cloud men&#39;s
minds, to make them see that which is not truly there, or to not see that which
truly is there.  I was amazed and intrigued at first, still fully awed by how
the temple had been hidden from not just me but from everyone else as well with
a simple thought from the Tulku.  I stayed with him for a full year, learning
about not just this new ability but the ethos and purpose of the Order of Light
as well.  When the true purpose of the Order was revealed to me, however, and
what the power of the clouded mind was intended to be used for.... I....&quot;
     Rei suddenly blinked hard as she saw a single solitary tear drip from the
corner of the old man&#39;s eye.  &quot;Grandpa...?&quot; she whispered as she moved to rise
to her feet and see if he was okay.  She promptly froze in mid-motion as his
eyes opened, letting her see for a single brief instant the depths of shame and
pain in his soul before his expression recomposed itself into a perfect mien of
impassiveness.
     &quot;I rebelled,&quot; he whispered very softly as he stared into the fire.  &quot;What
I learned disturbed me in a way I had never been disturbed before.  Up until
then I had thought that my training had been geared towards simple perfection
of myself, of expanding my mind to ultimately transcend mortal thoughts.  But
after being &#39;enlightened&#39; as to my true purpose,&quot; he added, almost literally
spitting into the fire at the word enlightened, &quot;I found nothing but discord
and discontent within me.  I forget how many nights I sat in discussion with
the Tulku afterwards, agitated beyond description while he remained utterly
calm and impassive.  Finally I decided I could not remain there any longer, and
after informing his Holiness of my decision, I packed the few possessions I had
and left the temple.  I have not returned since,&quot; he added quietly.
     Rei remained perfectly motionless as she studied her grandfather, unable
to fathom what he was feeling inside.  Her bloodstream felt like it was almost
literally on fire from tension, not at just watching her grandfather react in
an emotional way that she had never seen before, but from trying to sit on her
own sense of curiosity at the same time.  Literally hundreds of questions were
flooding her mind, begging her to speak up and ask them in the hopes that the
answers would satisfy her and ease the turmoil in her own spirit.
     &quot;Needless to say,&quot; he said after a large heaving sigh, visibly rallying
himself before looking up at her, &quot;I left not just the Order but China as well.
How I came here to Japan is not important, save that I did, and I have not left
the country since.  The only contact I had with the Order of Light before today
consisted of three letters, the first informing me of the Tulku&#39;s death some
years later and the second informing me later still that his reincarnation had
been found and subsequently enthroned.&quot;
     &quot;And the third?&quot; Rei found herself asking when he trailed off, wincing yet
again on the inside at failing to stop the impulse to speak.
     A very soft snort rose up from his chest.  &quot;An attempt at reconciliation
made many years ago,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;Had I bothered to write back, the message
would have consisted of a postcard of me telling the Tulku.... as your friend
Leda once phrased it, telling him where to stick it.&quot;
     The faintest of delicate blushes crossed Rei&#39;s face at the realization
that he had overheard the brunette&#39;s off-color comment during a particularly
boisterous discussion after school several months ago.  &quot;So what does this....
cloud ability do?&quot; Rei asked in a very cautious and careful tone, trying not to
wonder too hard what the conversation would be like after his explanation of
part of his enigmatic past.
     He sighed yet again and refocused on the gently crackling fire burning in
the pit between them.  &quot;You must understand one thing above everything else,
Rei,&quot; he said in a weary voice as he looked up at her.  &quot;Once I learned what it
truly was and how it was meant to be used, I made a conscious decision never to
use it again.  I view it as more than just a violation of privacy, but as a
violation of one&#39;s soul as well.  There are some passive aspects that can be
used, and I will admit to using them when necessary, but since I left I have
only used that ability once even in the slightest.  That lone instance was a
few moments ago, which to my relief I know you felt instantly.&quot;
     Rei simply nodded as her blood seemed to turn into an icy slush, suddenly
getting the feeling that she was about to be exposed to a dark or sinister
secret that she would rather not know about.  A truly horrific chill hit her
moments before her grandfather started to speak again, her subconscious mind
assembling a few pieces of the puzzle on its own to come up with a suggestion
that well and truly disturbed her peace of mind.
     &quot;This must not be mentioned to anyone else for any reason,&quot; he said in a
deathly quiet whisper.  &quot;I made that vow when I accepted the Tulku&#39;s offer to
be taught, and though I no longer agree with the teachings or their purpose I
have not broken my word.  The Tulku&#39;s letter gave me permission to speak to you
of it in general terms, providing that you agree to be bound by the same oath.
I ask that you not make it,&quot; he added, prompting a truly hard blink from her.
     &quot;What?&quot; she said, clearly startled by his suggestion.
     &quot;If you do not agree to be bound by the vow, I cannot tell you about it,&quot;
he said calmly.  &quot;And in all honesty, Rei, I would rather not have to tell you
about it.  However,&quot; he added in a tone of open resignation, &quot;I know that you
are as curious now as I was back then, and so I will not hold it against you if
you truly wish to inquire about it.&quot;
     Rei blinked again before she turned to focus on the fire, trying to calm
the sudden increase in turmoil inside her mind.  She knew that he was giving
her an excuse to avoid the matter, a face-saving way out that would not be an
embarrassment to either of them.  But at the same time, after having heard as
much as she already had and knowing that she herself probably had the same kind
of potential he did.... how could she *not* ask about it?
     &quot;I promise not to speak of any of this to anyone,&quot; she said quietly, her
eyes remaining downcast so as not to see the look on his face.
     &quot;At least I understand this much of you, Rei,&quot; he murmured, the faintest
ghost of a smile seeming to touch the edges of his lips for a moment.  &quot;Very
well then, I shall speak.  To be blunt, it is the power to invade the mind of
another, to impress your will upon them to cloud their senses.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Rei gasped as her head snapped up to look at him.  She was not
truly surprised to hear of this, having thought of the possibility that it
might be a latent psionic power similar to what Whisper and Ra&#39;vel had, but she
hadn&#39;t thought it would be something directly invasive.
     Her grandfather shook his head gently.  &quot;I cannot explain it any more than
that, Rei, as the mechanics of it are.... unique,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;I left the
Order before my studies were anywhere close to being finished, so my skill in
the art is significantly lacking.  The most I could do is touch the mind of
another, as you felt me do earlier, but even then it is a clumsy attempt that
can accomplish nothing and is easily felt by the.... victim,&quot; he said with a
faint snarl.  He sighed and looked up at her, giving her a somewhat sorrowful
look.  &quot;Rest assured I never tried this with you or anyone else, and I only did
so earlier purely to demonstrate.&quot;
     It took a few moments for Rei&#39;s mind to calm down to the point of letting
her respond to him in a rational way.  &quot;I believe you,&quot; she said, truthfully
feeling that he had indeed never tried to do so before.  Part of the tension in
her body began to evaporate a moment later as she thought about it, knowing
that the mere notion of such telepathy ran counter to the very core of his
strongly-held beliefs about a person&#39;s privacy.  Which would explain why he had
issues with it once he realized what it was for, she thought to herself as she
tried to relax even further.
     &quot;If the Tulku is offering to train you as his student,&quot; he spoke up in a
muted tone, &quot;Then it is likely that you possess the same potential as I do.  It
is not for me to say anything more about it or the uses of such an ability, but
I will nonetheless urge you to put it out of your mind as soon as you can.  We
both know that you have always had a.... penchant for spiritual energies,&quot; he
said, seeming to choose his words very carefully.  &quot;I have yet to meet someone
with a stronger or more intense focus of it, and I should not like to see that
inner balance disturbed by chaotic thoughts and self-doubts.&quot;
     &quot;Too late,&quot; Rei muttered softly, having to physically bite the tip of her
tongue an instant later to squash the impulse to slap herself for speaking up
yet again without thinking.  What the hell is wrong with me tonight? she found
herself thinking as she glanced up only to find her grandfather giving her a
look that was only partially amused.
     &quot;Rei....&quot; he started to say before falling silent and sighing heavily to
himself.  He continued to study her in silence for several moments before he
turned to look back at the fire yet again.  &quot;Yes, I know this is probably more
than a little confusing and chaotic for you right now,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;I too
was dazzled by it all in the beginning, and all I want is for you to avoid
being blinded by events as I was for a time.  Were it up to me, none of this
would have taken place and your balance would not have been upset by what was
said tonight.  However, it was not up to me, nor can I change the past to erase
what was said aloud.  All I can do now is try to guide you as I always have and
seek to steer you clear of danger you don&#39;t need.&quot;
     The priestess looked at him before nodding in understanding.  &quot;I know,&quot;
she whispered in reply, knowing that he well and truly was only looking out for
her best interests.  Or at least what he thought they were....
     Do you have the slightest clue about me? she found herself thinking as she
studied his weary visage.  Do you know I&#39;m Sailor Mars, and now Regent of the
Moon Kingdom?  Do you know that if Serena dies, the fate of the entire universe
will fall into my hands again?  Do you even know that our planet is in danger,
being a wormhole away from invasion by another world?  Do you know that my own
life was torn from me once, only to be brought back by the love of a girl who
isn&#39;t even fully human?  Do you have *ANY IDEA* what I&#39;ve done with my life in
the past year since she and I first met right here in this very temple?
     Another faint chuckle rose up from his chest, prompting a startled blink
from the priestess.  &quot;As if there isn&#39;t enough to contemplate at is is,&quot; he
said in an audibly weary tone, &quot;There is also a significant twist to events, as
it were.  I&#39;m sure you were listening closely to the conversation Wu and I had
earlier, though the context may not have been as clear as you would have liked.
In short, the Tulku has proposed an exchange program of sorts.  In exchange for
you becoming his student for a time, he is willing to send me a student of his
to see to your duties while you are in Tibet.&quot;
     &quot;A female student?&quot; Rei spoke up in a perfectly neutral tone, having been
able to pick up on that much from the earlier conversation.
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; her grandfather replied with a quiet grunt that was impossible
to read.  &quot;The first such woman admitted to the Order of Light, if I understand
things correctly.  If such an exchange were agreed to, she would travel here to
live with us for a short period of time in order to adjust and become familiar
with your chores before you left.  It is also my understanding that she is a
year or two older than you are and would have to share the room with you.&quot;
     Rei blinked but otherwise kept her face perfectly impassive, keenly aware
of how small the residence was and how there really wasn&#39;t any other place for
her to go unless she felt like sleeping in the pantry with the canned goods.
Perhaps sleeping in the living room next to the fire pit was technically an
option, which tended to be done during the dead of winter, but it would have
been quite rude to ask a live-in guest to have to do so.
     &quot;I take it that doesn&#39;t sit well with you,&quot; he observed after a moment of
heavy silence as he studied the look on her face.
     &quot;It would be different,&quot; Rei allowed carefully, still not entirely sure
what to make of the idea.  Sharing the room with a friend wasn&#39;t anything new
to her, not after having spent two nights in Susan&#39;s keep with Mina taking up
the other half of the bed to say nothing of previous sleepovers with the other
Sailor Scouts before the discovery of Nephlyte&#39;s cathedral and subsequent use
as their base of operations.
     &quot;It would,&quot; her grandfather agreed with a sage nod of his head.  &quot;And not
just for you, either.  After all, I would have more than just you to take care
of for a period of time.&quot;
     The faintest of chills started to trickle down Rei&#39;s spine as she thought
about what it would ultimately mean for them to have a live-in guest for even
a short period of time.  &quot;Do you really think we could afford that?&quot; she said
in an openly uneasy tone, all too aware of how precarious their financial
situation was.
     &quot;The Tulku&#39;s letter made mention of a monetary stipend for Taki during the
duration of her visit,&quot; he replied calmly.  &quot;Assuming that his Holiness didn&#39;t
have a nervous twitch in his hand when he wrote that part, you may rest assured
that she will not be a financial burden on us in the slightest.  Quite the
contrary,&quot; he added with the slightest gesture of his eyebrows.
     &quot;Taki?&quot; Rei echoed, giving him a rather curious look.
     &quot;The Tulku&#39;s student,&quot; he explained with a casual shrug.
     A faint frown brushed the edges of Rei&#39;s lips.  &quot;That&#39;s not exactly a
Chinese name,&quot; she pointed out carefully.
     &quot;Does it matter what her parents named her?&quot; he replied with a slight hint
of admonishment to his otherwise calm tone.
     &quot;You have a point,&quot; Rei admitted with a gentle sigh, giving him a faintly
embarrassed look at being chastised for the unnecessary comment.
     &quot;In any case, I know nothing further about her so there is little else I
can tell you,&quot; he said with a quiet sigh as he went back to staring into the
burning pit of the fire.  &quot;In any event, the Tulku&#39;s letter suggested that she
can stay with us for a period of time to study even if you do not wish to be
his student.  That is something else to consider, as with the circumstances
being what they are and if I were to overlook the fact that she is with the
Order of Light, I would be relatively open to the idea.  Providing, of course,
you are as well,&quot; he added with a twinkle of humor in his eyes.  &quot;I&#39;m not about
to saddle you with a guest if you don&#39;t think you could put up with a roommate
for a month or three.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;d have to think about it,&quot; Rei hedged cautiously.
     &quot;Of course,&quot; he replied with a gentle smile.  &quot;Believe me, I think we both
will be sleeping on the matter for a few weeks.  In any case, I expect it will
be early spring before a decision would have to be made, and that gives us more
than enough time to discuss the matter at our leisure.&quot;
     Rei cast a purely reflexive glance across the room towards the window,
knowing that autumn was in the process of taking hold and that the winter snows
were not too far over the meteorological horizon.  &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; she said absently,
trying not to think about what the outside air temperatures would be like in a
month or two.  At least Ami will be happy again, she thought, trying yet again
to imagine how someone could be perfectly content wearing a short-sleeve blouse
and light skirt in fifty-degree conditions.
     She glanced back over at her grandfather as she heard him chuckle very
softly to himself again, finding his gaze turned towards her yet again.  &quot;I
take it you have something on your mind, Rei?&quot; he prodded her in a tone that
made it quite clear he was simply teasing her.
     &quot;What do you think?&quot; Rei groused back, making sure to keep her voice free
from any sharp edges or acidic overtones.  She could deal with his occasional
teasing quite easily, and more often than not she was just as idly amused by it
as he was, but now was not one of those instances.  She knew that he would pick
up on the undertone to her reply, a minor rebuke of sorts that was still far
from being disrespectful or mean-spirited.
     He simply shook his head at her and looked back into the fire.  &quot;Since you
are asking,&quot; he replied in a subdued tone, &quot;I think you should forget about the
matter entirely and focus on your school-work and friends instead.  I doubt you
will, of course,&quot; he added with another faint and hollow laugh.  &quot;It is just
one of those things that grabs the imagination and won&#39;t let go.  Slipping into
the minds of others to make them &#39;forget&#39; to see you or something else, using
your thoughts as a weapon.... such fanciful stuff.  It is real, I assure you,
but it is also exceedingly dangerous and immoral,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;Does such a
thing surprise you, knowing that such a power exists in this world?&quot; he asked
as he looked back up at her with what seemed to be guarded curiosity.
     Rei blinked at the question before her face became perfectly impassive and
largely unreadable.  &quot;Not really,&quot; she replied in a neutral tone.  &quot;After all,
knowing what I know about spiritual energies and how they can be manipulated,
why shouldn&#39;t mental energies be any different?  Or are they?&quot; she added as she
kept her gaze on the wrinkles around his eyes, knowing that if she was going to
get any sort of non-verbal reaction from him it would show up there.
     Much to her surprise, he simply shrugged one shoulder at her in a gesture
of casual dismissal.  &quot;If anyone can say, Rei, it certainly isn&#39;t me,&quot; he said.
&quot;I never thought about it like that, but perhaps you are right.  Regardless of
the matter,&quot; he said as he slowly rose to his feet, &quot;I am done thinking about
the Order of Light for the day.  Perhaps another day we can debate such things
as one would philosophy or academics.  Try not to stay up too late, as you&#39;ve
got school in the morning.  And a test on shellfish to be rested for,&quot; he added
with a slight but still-meaningful gesture of his eyebrows.
     &quot;I know,&quot; Rei sighed as she looked down into the fire.  The faintest of
twinges could be felt in her abdomen as her gaze rested on a &#39;dent&#39; in the
normally straight lines of the stacked wood, knowing it had been caused by her
using the fire-poker in the corner to retrieve Mina&#39;s wand from the flames not
too long ago.
     She paused as a distinctly unusual tingle swept through her, causing her
to blink and look back up at her grandfather.  It took her a moment to realize
that it was identical to the tingle she had felt earlier when he had said he
used his &#39;clouded mind&#39; ability on her as a demonstration.  &quot;What is it?&quot; she
asked carefully as she saw the look of concentration on his face.
     The tingle abruptly vanished as he exhaled, the stress-lines on his face
smoothing out slightly.  &quot;I wasn&#39;t there when you were brought into this world,
Rei,&quot; he said very quietly, &quot;But I am here now and I love you just as much as
any father would his child.  Believe me when I say I am only trying to protect
you from things in this world that are better left undisturbed.  I cannot stop
you or anyone else from thinking, of course, but I nonetheless ask that you do
not dwell on what has been said earlier.  And remember your promise not to say
anything of it to anyone else,&quot; he added in a somber tone.  &quot;Good night.&quot;
     &quot;Good night, Grandpa,&quot; Rei replied quietly as she watched him leave the
living room and head towards his bedroom.  She turned her attention back to the
yellowish-orange fire and tried to clear her mind, knowing that what he had
just said and the implications behind it would make it all but impossible to
find peace and quiet in her nightly meditations.
     Believe me when I say I am only trying to protect you from things in this
world that are better left undisturbed, she heard his voice echoing softly in
the depths of her mind.  That makes two of us, Grandpa, she thought as images
of transforming into Sailor Mars and fighting the Negaverse flashed across her
mind&#39;s-eye.  A frown formed on her face as she suddenly thought of Susan and
her mysteriously cryptic ways, likewise saying similar words.
     Can it be both ways? she thought as she sat back with a silent sigh.  If
Grandpa is doing it out of a genuine feeling of protection, why can&#39;t Susan be
doing the same?  Or if Susan has her own agenda in doing so..... doesn&#39;t that
mean Grandpa would as well?  The power to invade the mind of another and make
them see something else?  Isn&#39;t that what Ami does with her vampiric hypnosis?
What about Whisper&#39;s mind powers?  Should I go talk to her about this?
     The thoughts continued to swirl madly in her mind long after she ceased to
be aware of her surroundings, the doubts and questions simply sliding back into
the depths of her subconscious mind as her conscious mind drifted off into a
shallow miasma of sleep that wasn&#39;t sleep, leaving her kneeling in front of the
fire in a state of suspended dreams that wouldn&#39;t be disturbed until long after
the fire pit consumed the last of its fuel and sputtered out into a collection
of dark ashes and glowing embers.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Freya?&quot; Nop&#39;tera said in a somewhat testy voice as she struggled to rise
into a sitting position under her own power.  &quot;I well and truly appreciate your
concern for my health and well-being, but if you don&#39;t settle down and soon I
am going to toss you out an open cargo hatch.  And you, Sor&#39;en, need to quit
encouraging her,&quot; she added as she cast a dark glare at her daughter.
     Brigadier Sor&#39;en just sighed and crossed her arms over her chest, giving
the blue-skinned woman a look of patient suffering.  &quot;Are we not allowed to be
worried about you anymore?&quot; she grumbled, ignoring the way Freya quailed at
Nop&#39;tera&#39;s words.
     &quot;Worry can be healthy in moderation,&quot; Nop&#39;tera countered as she finally
reached the position she wanted to be in, pausing to exhale softly in relief.
&quot;But there is no need to go overboard with it.  I&#39;m fine.&quot;
     A faint grumble of discontent rose up from Sor&#39;en&#39;s chest.  &quot;You mothered
me for a few decades like a vep&#39;tera does her hatchling,&quot; she muttered darkly,
more to herself than to either Nop&#39;tera or Freya.  &quot;I don&#39;t see what&#39;s so wrong
about trying to return the favor when you&#39;re seriously ill like this....&quot;
     &quot;Sor&#39;en....&quot; Nop&#39;tera moaned before she reached up to rub her sinuses.
&quot;Just give me the k&#39;vesi medical report, okay?  Is M awake yet?&quot;
     The Red Wing brigadier sighed quietly as she strode across the room to
insert a small data crystal into the slot next to the display monitor.  &quot;No,&quot;
she said as the screen lit up to show a still-image of the inside of a portable
magnetic containment unit.  A humanoid shape could be seen hanging in mid-air,
kept in place by the powerful magnetic field generated by the containment unit.
The blob of pink matter was curled up in a fetal position, only having the most
basic of shapes and curves to suggest that it was a living female denizen.
     &quot;Mmmm,&quot; Nop&#39;tera grunted softly as she studied the image of the metamorph.
&quot;She doesn&#39;t look too good like that.  Are they sure she&#39;ll be alright?&quot;
     Sor&#39;en blew her breath out slowly and consulted the small index card she
was carrying.  &quot;That&#39;s just it, they&#39;re only able to make educated guesses as
to her condition,&quot; she explained carefully.  &quot;Her cells are continuing to take
on definite aspects and firm up, so they think she&#39;ll be finished reforming her
body on her own in another day or two.  Healer Zun&#39;ya reports that she&#39;s able
to pick up a definite psi-trace of active mental function, but that it feels
more like M&#39;s in a coma than anything.  Of course, where the mental pattern is
coming from right now is being actively debated as we speak,&quot; she added dryly,
giving Nop&#39;tera a faintly unsettled look.  &quot;The nerve structures are all there,
but the synapses in her skull don&#39;t appear to have restarted just yet.  Or at
least what passes for her skull right now,&quot; she amended.
     Nop&#39;tera continued to study the image on the screen before sighing and
nodding sourly to her daughter.  &quot;That&#39;s unfortunate,&quot; she observed.  &quot;I had
hoped to be able to talk to her by this point, but it seems that being turned
into ionized plasma hit her harder than initially thought.  It will, of course,
be interesting to see if she remembers any of it,&quot; she added.
     &quot;Remind me again why she&#39;s even onboard the V&#39;ral?&quot; Sor&#39;en prodded in a
very careful tone.  &quot;Or why you&#39;re not about to pour her out the window like
you did with the last stowaway we caught in the cargo bay?&quot;
     &quot;Call her a surprise guest,&quot; Nop&#39;tera suggested as she started to twist to
one side, seeking to rotate her body to the left in what appeared to be another
attempt at getting out of bed.  &quot;Assuming she recovers and is willing to work
for me, I have a few assignments that I believe her unique skills are quite
suited for.  Mergh,&quot; she huffed as it took an immense amount of effort to move
her legs into the approximate position that she wanted.
     &quot;Mistress, please,&quot; Freya whimpered softly as she moved to assist, only to
freeze in mid-motion as Nop&#39;tera cast a chilling glare in her direction.
     &quot;What kind of assignments?&quot; Sor&#39;en spoke up, more out of genuine curiosity
than in an attempt to dampen Nop&#39;tera&#39;s irritation with her slave.
     &quot;Well,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied, her voice audibly strained as she continued to
try to get out of bed under her own power, &quot;I was actually thinking of sending
an envoy to Earth to make contact with the Sailor Scouts.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; Freya blurted out, her pale violet eyes going wide.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Sor&#39;en said in the same instant, her white eyebrows arching up in
mild surprise.  &quot;You want to send this Agent M woman to Earth, then?&quot;
     &quot;Only as a guide,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied as she eased her bare feet onto the
floor, trying not to grimace at the intense tingle of restored circulation that
was assaulting her nerves.  &quot;I don&#39;t know her that well, however, so I&#39;d still
need someone I could implicitly trust to be my envoy when dealing with the Moon
Princess.  I was actually thinking of sending you and Freya,&quot; she added as she
very carefully began to put some weight on her still-weak leg muscles.
     &quot;What?&quot; Sor&#39;en blurted out, almost dropping the index card she was still
holding.
     &quot;Nop&#39;tera?&quot; Freya gasped in a shocked whisper, causing the vampire to look
up at her.  &quot;You.... want *me* to go to Earth?&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera paused to glance up at the both of them.  &quot;Yes, I was thinking of
sending the both of you,&quot; she said slowly and clearly.  &quot;I can&#39;t send Ar&#39;kanis,
of course, as there is simply no way he&#39;d be able to masquerade as a human even
without his armor, and neither can I go to converse with the Moon Princess in
person unless she comes to the Negaverse.  In this case, Freya would act as my
envoy since she has studied the language,&quot; she said in a carefully measured
tone, casting a sidelong glance at her pale-haired slave.  &quot;And you, Sor&#39;en,
would be her escort and military liaison to ensure that nothing happens.  You
know that it is always prudent to present a show of arms, even when engaging in
peaceful discussions and negotiations,&quot; she added lightly.
     &quot;B-But, mistress....&quot; Freya said, her lower lip trembling as she tried to
contemplate visiting the world she had once been born to a thousand years ago.
     Nop&#39;tera sighed and momentarily ceased her most recent attempt at getting
herself out of bed.  &quot;Freya,&quot; she said firmly as she reached out to cup her
slave&#39;s chin, forcing her pale eyes up to meet her own featureless yellow gaze.
&quot;If I didn&#39;t have a measure of faith and confidence in you, I wouldn&#39;t even be
contemplating sending you to Earth.  Even after recent events,&quot; she added in a
moderate tone, knowing that Freya would understand her meaning.
     &quot;In any event,&quot; Nop&#39;tera continued as she let go of Freya&#39;s chin and cast
a patient look towards Sor&#39;en, &quot;I am certainly not going to dispatch anyone on
assignment until Ar&#39;kanis returns and the Chief Medical Officer decides to get
out of my ptanka about these k&#39;vesi stitches.  Don&#39;t look at me like that,&quot; she
added as Freya visibly flinched.  &quot;I&#39;m not blaming you for them, and in fact I
think you did an excellent job keeping the acid damage down to a minimum when
they had me in surgery.  Believe me, I am very grateful for your light touch.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Freya murmured softly, almost silently as she glanced away
with just the faintest hint of a blush on her otherwise pale cheeks.
     Sor&#39;en just sighed as she absently extracted the data crystal from the
access port and returned it to her pocket.  &quot;Any idea when he&#39;ll be back?&quot; she
asked in a cautious tone, the edges of her lips turning down in a slight frown
as Nop&#39;tera resumed her latest attempt at standing up unassisted.
     &quot;He asked for three days,&quot; the vampire replied calmly.  &quot;The first isn&#39;t
even over yet, so I wouldn&#39;t be overly concerned with the matter until sundown
the day after tomorrow.  Hopefully by then,&quot; she huffed as she made a serious
good-faith effort at rising to her feet, only to plop down on her backside a
moment later, &quot;I&#39;ll be able to walk properly.  Hmm,&quot; she added as she realized
that she was still in a sitting position.  &quot;I didn&#39;t fall over this time, that
is definitely an improvement....&quot;
     &quot;Mother,&quot; Sor&#39;en sighed as she briefly buried her face in hands.
     &quot;Sor&#39;en, go find something to do before I break out the video clip I have
of you trying to walk for the first time as an infant,&quot; Nop&#39;tera suggested in
a distinctly casual tone as she gave thought to trying to stand up again.  &quot;I
assure you that you had your own issues with physical strength versus the need
to move about on your own at the time.&quot;
     Sor&#39;en promptly blinked hard and glanced over at Freya, feeling an icy
ball form in her gut as the slave promptly looked away with a telltale blush of
embarrassment on her cheeks.  &quot;You&#39;re bluffing right?&quot; she inquired cautiously
as she gave her mother an openly unsettled look.
     Nop&#39;tera paused and twisted her head to cast a somewhat unfriendly glance
over her shoulder.  &quot;It&#39;s stored in the pale gold memory crystal in my safe,&quot;
she said in a slightly flat tone that clearly said she wasn&#39;t bluffing.  &quot;It
should be the one between the Felinoid claw and the plasma sword casing, unless
everything got tossed around in yesterday&#39;s blast.  Speaking of which, I should
go check on it,&quot; she added as she turned back to look at Freya.  &quot;I doubt that
anything would have been broken being tossed around, but that claw could put a
few hard scratches in something if it was knocked around at the wrong angle.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll take care of that,&quot; Freya promised quietly.  &quot;You still need to try
to get some rest, your body is still low on energy and is still healing.&quot;
     &quot;Freya, for the last time....&quot;
     &quot;Mother?&quot; Sor&#39;en interrupted, her tone causing both Freya and Nop&#39;tera to
blink and look at her.  &quot;You seriously took videos of me as a child?  I know
about the baby pictures, of course, what parent doesn&#39;t have those, but....&quot;
     &quot;Sor&#39;en, when was the last time I made an empty bluff?&quot; Nop&#39;tera reminded
her in a gentle tone as she decided that she had made enough progress for the
moment and carefully laid back against the pillows.  &quot;And I&#39;m not talking about
a simple game of cards in the mess hall, either.  With cards, bluffing with a
less-than-ideal hand is almost required,&quot; she added, allowing an audible note
of humor to tint her otherwise unamused tone.
     &quot;The third battle of Sil-Ti&#39;ar comes to mind,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied as she idly
leaned against the wall and folded her arms over her chest.
     Nop&#39;tera visibly paused before giving her daughter an uneasy look.  &quot;That
was a feint and not a bluff,&quot; she corrected.  &quot;Besides, the forward batteries
of both the V&#39;ral and the Visage were not completely empty.  Low, but we could
still have punched through their defenses in a modified catapult maneuver if we
truly had to, so it could hardly be called an empty bluff.  If you want a prime
example of an empty bluff, try listening to Ar&#39;kanis&#39; radio transmission to the
Central Plains military division earlier today threatening to &#39;deal with&#39; any
unit firing missiles at him.&quot;
     A truly sour look promptly took up residence on Sor&#39;en&#39;s face.  &quot;I caught
that from the bridge,&quot; she muttered.  &quot;I might have to put Major Sirene in for
a commendation for not shooting him for that.  Tank diplomacy has its uses, of
course, but it doesn&#39;t quite work that well when you&#39;re flying in an unarmed
aircraft usually used for directing air traffic.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure the good Major will be given the chance to express herself upon
her safe return to the V&#39;ral,&quot; Nop&#39;tera murmured with a faint hint of a smile.
&quot;Now that I think about it.... she has been performing a few special operations
for me as of late, hasn&#39;t she?  Perhaps it is time I took another look at her
service file to make sure I haven&#39;t overlooked something noteworthy.&quot;
     Sor&#39;en&#39;s eyebrows promptly arched up in mild surprise, knowing that it
wasn&#39;t all that often that Nop&#39;tera went out of her way to directly review a
candidate for promotion, especially outside of the usual review cycles.  As the
Wing Commander it was Sor&#39;en&#39;s responsibility to review the service records of
those who dealt with the aircraft, just as it was Ar&#39;kanis&#39; dominion as Tank
Commander to vet candidates from the armored divisions.  Nop&#39;tera had the final
say in matters, of course, but she more often than not relied on the input from
the rest of her command staff and only occasionally handled the reviews on a
personal basis.
     &quot;If you&#39;re going to start reviewing paperwork,&quot; Sor&#39;en spoke up carefully,
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d consider looking at Lieutenant Ten&#39;ako from my Thunder
wing and Junior Lieutenant Stick from Colonel Tha&#39;an&#39;s Windslash wing?  Well,
everyone else calls him Stick,&quot; she amended with a mild blush of embarrassment.
&quot;Windslash-15, the Felinoid.  Nobody can seem to pronounce his name correctly,
and he tends to get irked when we have him try to say it for us....&quot;
     &quot;S&#39;tk&#39;alar,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied casually.
     Sor&#39;en blinked in surprise before sighing quietly.  &quot;How in the name of
the NegaForce do you keep doing that?&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;Every time Tha&#39;an tries
to say it like that, she ends up sounding like she&#39;s choking on a hairball.&quot;
     &quot;What can I say, I&#39;ve always liked Felinoids,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said with a gentle
shrug of her shoulders.  &quot;They do take some getting used to, especially when
they&#39;re young and hot-tempered like Lieutenant S&#39;tk&#39;alar is, but that is part
of their charm.  Call it an acquired taste.  As with all languages, it takes a
bit of dedicated focus to properly master.  In any case, he could use a little
more seasoning before the next cycle, so he&#39;ll have to wait for the next round
of proficiency tests first.  Likewise for your Lieutenant Ten&#39;ako.  However, I
am aware that much has happened since our last promotion cycle review, and not
a small amount of combat experience gained in the interim, so it is likely I
will be calling for a full cycle review to begin in the coming weeks once the
matter of General Rune is settled.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Sor&#39;en said as she came off the wall and stood up straight, her ash-
gray eyes widening slightly in surprise.  &quot;So soon?&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera paused and regarded her daughter carefully.  &quot;I take it you have
an objection to that notion?&quot; she inquired in a moderate tone.
     &quot;A full review will take months,&quot; Sor&#39;en pointed out.  &quot;And I&#39;m sure that
both Training and Internal Review would like to watch over our shoulders to see
how we&#39;ve been doing things now that we&#39;re back in the Negaverse.  Begging the
General&#39;s pardon, coordinating that is going to be a significant distraction in
of itself to say nothing of how it&#39;ll impact our assigned duties.&quot;
     A deep chill suddenly flooded Sor&#39;en&#39;s veins as she watched Nop&#39;tera lean
back against her pillow with a dangerously soft smile on her dark blue lips.
&quot;In that case, Brigadier,&quot; the general said slowly and with open satisfaction,
&quot;I&#39;d say you just found something constructive to do.  You may defer any such
initial planning and preparation for this until Ar&#39;kanis returns, of course, as
his current mission deserves our full attention.  Once the situation becomes a
little more stable, however, I think we can afford to work in reintegrating
ourselves back into the rest of the Negaverse&#39;s military.&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera&#39;s smile only grew wider as Sor&#39;en leaned back against the wall
and let her breath out in a protracted exodus of air.  &quot;In other words,&quot; the
brigadier grumbled in a tone as dry as any arid desert, &quot;I should have left you
alone earlier like you suggested.&quot;
     &quot;No, I would have asked this of you at some point,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied as
she briefly considered trying to get out of bed under her own power again.  &quot;I
just figured that telling you about this now was a good time to do so as any.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, Mother,&quot; Sor&#39;en sighed as she rubbed her face.
     All three women paused in mid-motion as there was a soft chime from the
overhead speakers, warning them that an all-call message was about to follow.
&quot;Attention all Red Wings,&quot; the voice of the third-watch helmsman said, &quot;We are
approaching the outer edges of a storm front and are liable to start picking up
some moderate turbulence in the next few hours.  I&#39;m going to try to skirt the
worst of it as best I can, so be ready for a few bumps and shakes.  Brigadier
Sor&#39;en to the bridge, please.  Engineering, set watch level 2 for possible main
engine restart.  Bridge out.&quot;
     &quot;Bah,&quot; Sor&#39;en grumbled as she resumed rubbing her face to try to ease the
tension in her sinuses.  &quot;If things get too bad and there isn&#39;t an easy way to
cruise out, I&#39;m going to order the mains fired up to get us out of that,&quot; she
said to her mother.  &quot;A little turbulence is one thing, but I don&#39;t need the
deck swaying back and forth like we&#39;re stuck in the middle of an ocean during
a localized hurricane.&quot;
     &quot;Noted,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied in a slightly subdued tone, having to bite her
tongue to keep from issuing an order of her own.  She knew that Sor&#39;en would
listen to whatever she said regardless of her current medical status, but it
was the whole principle of the matter that kept her silent.  For now, the V&#39;ral
was in Sor&#39;en&#39;s hands until Ar&#39;kanis returned, at which point it would be in
his hands until she finished healing.  Or until his three days were up, she
thought silently to herself.
     &quot;Freya, make sure she stays in bed for this,&quot; Sor&#39;en added as she made her
way towards the door.  &quot;If the deck does start heaving, we don&#39;t need her being
tossed around like dice on a casino table.&quot;
     &quot;Brigadier Sor&#39;en....&quot; Nop&#39;tera started to say in a flat tone.
     &quot;Mother, please,&quot; Sor&#39;en pleaded quietly as she turned back around to face
the blue-skinned vampire.  &quot;I know you hate this, but right now you can&#39;t even
stand up on your own when the deck is stable.  Trying to do so when the deck is
rolling around is going to be ten times worse, and I well and truly think you&#39;d
be better off trying to save your strength for later.  Believe me, I hated it
when I was confined to bed after that nonsense at Vul Latt, so I know how you
feel.  It&#39;s just that....&quot;
     &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said testily.  She glared at Sor&#39;en for a moment
before sighing softly and making a dismissive gesture.  &quot;Alright, I&#39;ll stay in
bed.  Now report to the bridge before things get unpleasant.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied with a crisp salute before leaving the room,
leaving a visibly uneasy Freya alone to try to console and comfort Nop&#39;tera.
The bedroom door shut a moment later, followed several moments later by an
almost inaudible chime to indicate that someone was either entering or leaving
through the main doors outside.
     &quot;Finally,&quot; Nop&#39;tera grumbled as she started to swing her legs over the
edge of the bed again in another apparent attempt at getting up.
     &quot;Mistress?&quot; Freya blurted out, her pale eyes going wide.  &quot;What are you
doing?  You shouldn&#39;t be....&quot;
     Nop&#39;tera silenced her with a simple look, one white eyebrow arching up in
mild reproval.  &quot;We&#39;re not into the turbulence yet,&quot; she pointed out.  &quot;I have
every intention of doing what I promised Sor&#39;en I would do, unhappy with the
prospect as I am, but I have to use the bathroom first.&quot;
     &quot;Oh,&quot; Freya replied softly, her cheeks taking on a pale pink tint.  &quot;Here,
please, let me help you,&quot; she said as she held her arm out to use as a brace.
     Nop&#39;tera looked at her for a moment before sighing and gritting her teeth,
reaching out to accept Freya&#39;s arm and allowing her slave&#39;s vampiric strength
to gently pull her into a standing position.  &quot;I do wish Ar&#39;kanis would hurry
up,&quot; she muttered, more to herself than to Freya as she began a slow and almost
torturous shuffle across the floor towards the bathroom.  &quot;It shouldn&#39;t take
him too long to convince Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren that Rune has overstepped her
authority and have her arrested.  Freya....&quot; she added in a suddenly thoughtful
tone, catching the other woman off-guard.
     &quot;Mistress?&quot; Freya inquired carefully, not entirely sure what to make of
the look on Nop&#39;tera&#39;s face.
     &quot;When we&#39;re done with this, go pull that memory crystal out of the safe,&quot;
Nop&#39;tera instructed absently.  &quot;I just realized that I haven&#39;t watched those
videos we made of Sor&#39;en&#39;s infancy since they were first taken.  I suppose if
I&#39;m to be confined to bed for awhile longer, I might as well pass the time by
watching them.  Taking them was your idea in the first place, remember?&quot; she
added lightly.
     Freya nodded somberly.  &quot;I remember,&quot; she said quietly.
     &quot;Perhaps there is something to be said for remembering such things after
all,&quot; Nop&#39;tera mused quietly to herself as she was led into the bathroom.  &quot;As
you said back then, a lot can happen in the span of a day.  Amazing how she has
changed in the span of four hundred years, all grown up now.  And yes, Ar&#39;kanis
is right.... her parents would have been proud of her.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re her mother now,&quot; Freya reminded her gently.
     &quot;Yes, I know, another one of your ideas,&quot; the Dark General pointed out.
&quot;It would have been interesting to see how things turned out had you raised her
as Ar&#39;kanis suggested, but no matter, she is my daughter now as you said.  Now
here&#39;s a frightening thought,&quot; she added in an openly amused tone as she closed
the bathroom door.  &quot;Could you imagine Sor&#39;en making me a grandmother one day?
As if my hair isn&#39;t white enough as it is, heh heh....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     The electronic lock seemed to take an unusually long time to validate her
passcard before flashing green, allowing Sailor V to open the side door to the
bank&#39;s administrative lobby and quietly slip inside.  Normally she would have
simply walked through the front doors to access the elevators, but even the
extended-hours teller had gone home for the night and so the rest of the main
lobby was closed and under typical security lockdown until the morning.  That
left the employee entrance by the back parking lot as the only way she could
get in without creating a huge ruckus.
     A second swipe of the card on another reader at the far end of the hallway
resulted in a soft ding as it opened the cargo elevator in the corner, knowing
that she would be seen on the security cameras if she used the other elevators
in the lobby.  While the access card she possessed was a valid one, having been
&#39;issued&#39; to her by the bank executive she was going to see, it was her quiet
understanding that Security had yet to become aware of the fact that she was
using it and hence saw no reason to tip them off to the situation.
     A simple jab of her fingertip on the proper button once the doors closed
was enough to set the elevator into slow motion, gliding up on its tracks at a
steady pace that traded speed for heavy lifting capacity.  As always, she found
herself becoming both anxious and impatient for it to reach the desired floor,
knowing that the custodial staff was still present and tended to make use of
the cargo elevator for trash disposal.  She had already had one entirely too-
close call as it was, able to save herself from discovery by ducking behind a
trash bin at the last moment, and it was something she keenly wished to avoid
having to experience ever again.
     The elevator finally slowed to a halt before dinging quietly and parting
the doors.  A cursory glance into the hallway showed it was empty, much to her
relief, and she promptly settled into a somewhat rapid walk down the length of
the corridor towards the one office room that was still lit.  She paused as she
reached the doorway and carefully edged to one side to peer in, checking to see
if his secretary was still around.  Seeing that the room was empty, she took a
deep breath and strode inside to carefully knock on the slightly-ajar door to
the inner office.
     &quot;Come in,&quot; a weary voice said, sounding slightly distracted.
     V carefully eased the door open wider and stuck her head in.  &quot;Howdy,&quot; she
said lightly, giving him a smile as he lifted his head up from the paperwork on
his desk.  &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, but I had a burr under my saddle that really needed
to be plucked.&quot;
     James Burrow, Senior Vice President (International Division) for the Bank
of Japan simply shook his head as he gestured for her to take a seat.  &quot;That
sounds bad, but I&#39;ll not bother asking about the details.  You didn&#39;t get hurt
or anything in that, did you?&quot; he added, all too aware of some of the things
she did that made the evening news.
     &quot;Oh, no, no, nothing like that,&quot; she replied with a wave of her hand as
she moved to sit in the offered chair.  &quot;Someone needed a stern talking-to, and
I think I actually managed to get through his thick skull this time, which is
nothing short of a minor miracle in of itself, but that should have been dealt
with months ago.  Nope, no police reports for me tonight,&quot; she added with a
twinkle of amusement in her bright blue eyes.
     &quot;That&#39;s good,&quot; Mr. Burrow said as he glanced back down at the stack of
folders on his desk.  &quot;You might have to help me fill out a police report in a
day or two, however, depending if this is what I think it is.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Sailor V said in a suddenly wary tone, giving him a slightly uneasy
look.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me someone pooched a deposit or something.&quot;
     The bank executive paused for a brief moment before leaning back in his
leather chair and picking up a red-tabbed folder from the stack.  &quot;Funny you
should mention an improper deposit,&quot; he said slowly.
     V arched one eyebrow up.  &quot;Like I said earlier, I didn&#39;t do it.  Not that
I know what&#39;s going on, mind you,&quot; she amended quickly.  &quot;But still, I don&#39;t
recall doing anything unusual with my account lately.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m afraid of,&quot; Mr. Burrow countered.  &quot;You aren&#39;t trying to
set up a combination checking-and-savings account with us in your real name,
are you?&quot;
     That drew a hard blink from V.  &quot;Uh, no,&quot; she replied as she felt an icy
ball form in her abdomen.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, your reputation is solid gold
in my book and I just love what you&#39;ve done with my investment portfolio, but
I don&#39;t need any dots being connected between two accounts.  If I ever get off
my cute butt and decide I need an account for casual personal use, I&#39;ll get an
account with my Dad&#39;s bank, which unfortunately happens to be one of your other
less-than-market-share-threatening rivals.  No offense,&quot; she added with an
impish smile and a faint blush of embarrassment.
     &quot;None taken,&quot; Mr. Burrows replied with a gesture of dismissal.  &quot;And to be
perfectly honest, that&#39;s what I would have suggested you do as well.&quot;
     &quot;Mmhmm,&quot; she said as she warily eyed the folder he had just opened.  &quot;So
I take it my birth-name is being tossed around in public or something?&quot;
     &quot;It seems someone is attempting to open a number of fraudulent accounts in
a few names,&quot; the banker explained as he gestured with the folder.  &quot;Your name
happens to be one of them.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, lovely,&quot; V sighed as she put her elbows on her knees and tossed her
chin into her hand.  &quot;So who&#39;s the genius trying to pull a fast one?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m afraid I can&#39;t reveal that information now,&quot; he apologized as the
folder was closed and set back down on the stack.  &quot;Seeing how I now have proof
that this is indeed fraud, it becomes a criminal matter and you know there are
laws about revealing such things during any potential legal investigation.&quot;
     &quot;James?&quot; she said in a somewhat flat and disappointed tone, drumming her
gloved fingertips against her cheek.  &quot;Games are fun to play, believe me, but
this is my short-skirted butt on the line if some ornery financial detective
starts sniffing around like a starving bloodhound looking for a can of Alpo.
Just give me the goofball&#39;s name, maybe I can solve a few mysteries for you on
my own.  Who knows, I might even know the doofus,&quot; she added sourly.
     &quot;Unlikely, seeing how the wire-transfer originated in the United Kingdom,&quot;
Mr. Burrow warned as he leaned forward slightly.  &quot;And because it came from an
overseas institution, this is now an international affair.  I&#39;m sure Interpol
would love to have your autograph, but they would probably hate having you try
to &#39;help&#39; them along.&quot;
     &quot;What, did Ming take the coffee pot with her when she left?&quot; V smirked as
she sat up and leaned forward to rest her arms on the edge of his desk.  &quot;That
would explain why you&#39;re a bit out of it right now, or at least why you forgot
that my celebrity career of fame and fortune got started in England,&quot; she said
in a teasing manner.  &quot;Trust me, Mister Banker-Man, I&#39;m quite familiar with the
United Kingdom.  Or at least the civilized portion of it,&quot; she added with a
wicked grin.
     Mr. Burrow sighed heavily and gave her a level look before glancing down
at the stack of folders neatly arranged on the corner of his desk.  &quot;Alright,&quot;
he said in a low tone.  &quot;But if you start something that screws up anything in
the investigation....&quot;
     &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; she fussed, giving him a sour look.  &quot;I know you&#39;ve got a
thing for protecting your money and your clients, which believe me is very,
very greatly appreciated, but this involves my real name here.  If that gets
leaked to the press, you *know* they&#39;ll print it in big, bold letters on the
front page along with a picture of my cuteness for easy identification.  And we
both know how interesting life for me will get once that winds up in the chow
halls of every prison in the country,&quot; she added darkly.
     The bank executive merely nodded his head in understanding.  &quot;I know,&quot; he
said simply.  &quot;Which is the only reason I&#39;m even considering doing this.  And
don&#39;t get me started on the &#39;I owe you&#39; line, that little debt....&quot;
     &quot;Is being repaid by all the wonderful help you&#39;ve given me by helping me
keep my finances in order,&quot; V interrupted smoothly, flashing him a charming
smile.  &quot;Believe me, I know and appreciate what you&#39;ve done for me.  And be
honest here, when have I *ever* even attempted to suggest you owe me anything
else beyond our little arrangement?&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m just saying, V,&quot; Mr. Burrow muttered quietly as he leaned back in his
chair and sighed heavily.  &quot;International fraud is a very serious matter and I
don&#39;t want to end up torpedoing anything by breaking a non-disclosure rule and
getting a vigilante involved.&quot;
     &quot;Make you a deal,&quot; V offered.  &quot;If I don&#39;t know the name, I don&#39;t try to
do anything about things and play along with your police report instead.&quot;
     He regarded her carefully in silence before nodding slowly.  &quot;Alright, I
suppose I can live with that much.  The name you want is Susan Meiou, she....&quot;
     &quot;WHAT?&quot; Sailor V blurted out as she shot to her feet, her eyes widening
dangerously around the edges of her oversized glasses.
     &quot;I sense that name is known to you,&quot; Mr. Burrow ventured carefully as he
studied the expression on her face.
     &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; V said in a very dangerously calm tone as she turned to look at
the stack of folders.  &quot;Believe me, I am quite familiar with our green-haired
friend.  Wait, who else did she try to open an account for?&quot; she added as she
noticed that several other colored flags were visible in the stack.
     &quot;Sorry, privacy rules,&quot; the banker pointed out.  &quot;Hey!&quot; he protested as V
suddenly scooped up the folders, quickly sifting through the tabs to read the
name on each one.  She managed to read most of them before the entire stack was
yanked out of her grasp, looking up to find a very unhappy bank executive
glaring at her.
     &quot;You know what?&quot; V said before he could speak.  &quot;I bet I can solve this
whole mess for you.  I know every single name on those folders, and I know how
it all ties together with Susan.  I&#39;m not allowed to explain it to you, since
that will blow my cover as Sailor V and then some, but I can say that this is
not a case of fraud but merely a case of Hanlon&#39;s Razor biting us both pretty
hard on the bum-cheeky.  I&#39;ll leave it to your imagination as to where it is
about to bite Chancellor Meiou,&quot; she added darkly as she reached behind her to
extract her Sailor Scout communicator from her Lunar Space pocket.  &quot;Would you
excuse me for a moment?  I have a call to make,&quot; she said as she stepped out of
his office and gingerly closed the door behind her, not giving him enough time
to voice an objection.  She then closed the front door and looked around to
make sure that nobody could either see or hear her.
     A quick brush of her thumb across one of the new buttons resulted in a
quiet chirp and a flash of dark green light on her display, letting her know
that she was trying to open the Pluto channel.  The device chirped again before
the channel was opened and Susan&#39;s image appeared in the tiny window.
     &quot;Good evening,&quot; Susan said quietly, seeming to be a little surprised.
     &quot;Hey, spooky lady,&quot; V replied, giving the succubus a smile that was quite
obviously faked.  &quot;We need to talk.  Preferably in person.  You busy?&quot;
     &quot;At the moment, no,&quot; Susan said carefully.  &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;
     &quot;Ohhh, big-time,&quot; V assured her.  &quot;Seeing how prison-orange pinstripes
would probably clash something fierce with your dark green hair, you might want
to start explaining why you just tried to open a bank account in my name.  And,
I should stress, without my knowledge or permission,&quot; she added, allowing her
displeasure to finally show through unmasked.  &quot;That&#39;s called felony fraud, by
the way, not to mention putting me at risk by using my real name.&quot;
     A delicate green eyebrow was raised on the monitor.  &quot;If I may briefly set
aside the question of consent and permission, I fail to see what sort of risk
such a thing would be exposing you to,&quot; Susan replied calmly.  &quot;And I assure
you that I examined the situation from every conceivable angle beforehand.&quot;
     &quot;Guess which bank Sailor V does official business with?&quot; V said flatly.
&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s right,&quot; she said as Susan blinked hard and seemed to pale just
slightly.  &quot;You set off one bright red flag when you filed that paperwork, and
believe me when I say that I am Not Happy with this.  Give me a good reason not
to go along with my accountant&#39;s suggestion of filing fraud charges?  Multiple
fraud charges, seeing how you tried to open an account in the rest of our names
as well, and five bucks says you didn&#39;t ask them for permission either.  Oh,
and it&#39;d be international fraud charges at that, with wire transfers crossing
continents and oceans and all that fun stuff,&quot; she added casually.
     &quot;I understand your displeasure, Mina,&quot; Susan replied patiently.  &quot;The goal
of my venture was to provide and establish financial resources for the eight of
you should the need arise.  Alex, Michelle, and I would certainly need them, of
course, and I was under the impression that the rest of you could benefit from
them as well.  There was no malicious intent at all, and certainly nothing that
could be construed as attempted fraud,&quot; she admonished.
     V frowned at the tone of the explanation.  &quot;You know what, demon?  I just
might be willing to believe that.  However, I&#39;m not the only one who needs to
have things explained,&quot; she warned.  &quot;The senior Vice President is sitting at
his desk in the office behind me, and I&#39;m quite sure that he&#39;d love to hear the
whole story.  In fact, I know he&#39;ll insist on it before he considers changing
his mind on the whole fraud issue, which he is deadly serious about seeing how
my name wasn&#39;t the only one that triggered a very loud warning.&quot;
     Susan paused and cocked her head at a slight angle.  &quot;I can certainly
provide an explanation in person if he desires,&quot; she said slowly.  &quot;Just whom
else was flagged by my applications?&quot;
     &quot;Me, Leda, Ami, and I think that last one was Darian, but I only got a
short glimpse of things,&quot; V replied, casting a brief glance over her shoulder
to make sure that she wasn&#39;t being spied on.  &quot;Susan, I&#39;m serious,&quot; she said as
she turned back to look at the tiny image on her communicator with a genuinely
somber look.  &quot;You might have had good intentions with whatever it is you tried
to pull, but you reeeeeally stomped in a big pile of doggy-doo this time and
the stench is atrocious.  Had you just stuck with Alex and Michelle, nobody
would have said word one or even thought anything was fishy.&quot;
     &quot;I will attempt to rectify the situation as soon as I can,&quot; Susan promised
quietly.  &quot;You said that your manager is available right now?&quot;
     &quot;Uhhh....&quot; V said, blinking hard.  &quot;Yeah, somewhat.  Wait, don&#39;t tell me
you&#39;re just going to wave your staff around and &#39;port on over here, that would
really raise a few eyebrows.  Umm.... okay, try it like this.  I know you&#39;ve
got a decently fast car and a mild respect for local speed laws, so it should
only take you.... what, seven minutes to get here?  Ten if you can&#39;t find a
decent parking spot?&quot;
     The green-haired woman promptly blinked.  &quot;While I do know how to operate
a ground vehicle that is similar in construction to.....&quot; she started to say
before pausing in mid-sentence and tilting her head at an odd angle.  &quot;Ah, I
believe I understand your meaning now,&quot; she said after a few moments of careful
thought.  &quot;Yes, I shall arrange to &#39;arrive by car&#39; in ten minutes.&quot;
     &quot;At least you&#39;re quicker on the uptake than Alex,&quot; V observed absently.
&quot;Anyway, if we&#39;re going to do this the right way, we&#39;re going to need to be on
the same page before we start trying to tap-dance in a mine field.  How exactly
are you going to try to spin this cow-patty into something palatable?&quot;
     Susan raised an eyebrow at V&#39;s choice of words before taking a breath to
speak.  &quot;As I told Mr. Bloom, I am a business woman of comfortable means who
unfortunately had a favored aunt pass away.  My aunt was heir to a previously-
unknown fortune that was only recently rediscovered, and as the executor of her
non-binding will I am putting that fortune to use by seeing to the financial
needs of some of her less-than-well-off friends.&quot;
     &quot;Ah, yes, poor Aunt Rose,&quot; V said calmly.  &quot;I remember her with fondness,
to say nothing of absolutely adoring her recipe for oatmeal cookies.  They just
don&#39;t make cookies like they used to,&quot; she added with a dry smirk.  &quot;Just out
of random curiosity, how rich was she?&quot;
     &quot;My aunt, not at all,&quot; Susan replied with the faintest hint of a smile,
more than a little surprised by how smoothly V was adapting to the scenario she
was describing.  &quot;Our ancestor&#39;s family fortune, however, hasn&#39;t been fully
appraised yet but at last guess it was valued at somewhere between three and
seven hundred million pounds.  Before taxes, of course,&quot; she added lightly.
     &quot;Wow, wealthy lady,&quot; V said, visibly stunned by the notion that Susan now
had access to that much money and was willing to share it with the rest of the
Sailor Scouts.  &quot;So, umm.... not to sound nosy or anything.... but....&quot;
     A knowing smile crossed Susan&#39;s face.  &quot;Twenty-five thousand each for the
initial account setup,&quot; she explained, causing Sailor V to blink hard enough to
almost be heard across the channel.  &quot;Four thousand for unrestricted checking,
seven thousand for limited savings, and the other fourteen thousand to be used
as a foundation for self-sufficiency through investments and the like.  As I
said, I intended for this to be a pleasant surprise, although I will admit that
perhaps I should have indeed consulted with everyone beforehand.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, advanced notice would have been nice,&quot; V agreed, still in a bit of
a daze at the thought of simply being given that much money for personal use
above and beyond the modest allotment she had set aside from her non-charity
income as Sailor V.  Money that she raised for charity never came anywhere near
her private account, and the bulk of the commercial royalties she made from the
sale of Sailor V merchandise likewise only made the briefest of stops in her
bank before being forwarded to a diverse array of charities.  Of the four or
five percent that did linger, most of it was channeled in a very discreet way
to her college savings account while the remaining amount was hers to use as
she saw fit.  Access to that money was granted via a particular ATM machine in
a remote part of the city that had been discreetly reprogrammed to recognize
her bank access card and transact as instructed just like any other ATM.
     &quot;So we&#39;re all good friends of poor departed Aunt Rose, then?&quot; she added as
she shook her head to clear the momentary daze.  &quot;That might work for most of
us, but I&#39;ve still got a funny feeling something will be overlooked and go boom
when we start dancing around this one,&quot; she warned.
     Susan simply shook her head.  &quot;I am certain that between my diplomatic
skills and your penchant for improvisation and relative finesse, we can resolve
the situation to everyone&#39;s mutual satisfaction,&quot; she said demurely.
     V raised an eyebrow before sighing quietly.  &quot;When you put it like that,
it makes me feel like I need to take a shower or something to get all the slime
off,&quot; she said dryly.  &quot;Alright, demon, we&#39;ll give this one a shot.  But don&#39;t
come crying to me if you wind up doing the perp-walk for fraud regardless,&quot; she
warned in an ominous tone.  &quot;And keep in mind you&#39;re going to have to try to
explain this little behind-the-back stunt to everyone else.&quot;
     &quot;I will handle that tomorrow once the paperwork clears,&quot; Susan replied.
     &quot;Awful big assumption there, my friend, but it&#39;s your headache,&quot; V said
with a casual shrug of dismissal.  &quot;Anyway, you need to get into your little
fast car and start driving, I&#39;ll tell him you&#39;re on your way.&quot;
     &quot;I shall be there in ten minutes,&quot; the succubus promised.
     &quot;Mind the traffic,&quot; V added lightly.  &quot;Racking up pedestrian points may
sound cool, but the local police will absolutely hate you for it and we don&#39;t
need to be adding to the workload of Ami&#39;s mother, now do we?  See ya,&quot; she
said before flicking her thumb across the button to close the channel.
     V sighed quietly as she returned the communicator to her Lunar Space
pocket and absently smoothed her skirt out, pausing in mid-motion as a stray
thought popped into her mind.  Speaking of which, she mused as she carefully
opened the inner office door and headed back inside.  &quot;Hey, hey,&quot; she said in
a cheerful tone.  &quot;Miss me?&quot;
     Mr. Burrow lifted his head up from another stack of paperwork, one gray
eyebrow arching up in faint amusement.  &quot;And if I said no?&quot; he inquired.
     V paused before her face slipped into a pout.  &quot;Meanie,&quot; she muttered as
she sat back down in the chair.  &quot;Susan is on her way here, by the way, and
knowing how she drives it should only be a matter of minutes.&quot;
     &quot;I see,&quot; the banker said slowly as he set the paperwork aside and leaned
back in his chair, absently folding his hands over his stomach.  &quot;So tell me
who she is and how you know one another?&quot; he prompted.
     V sighed heavily, the gesture puffing out her cheeks for several seconds.
&quot;Susan is an odd one, but she&#39;s hardly up to no good.  She&#39;s a business type
like you are and recently became a member of the family,&quot; she said, giving him
a meaningful look.  &quot;I suppose this stunt is her idea of paying me back, along
with a few friends of her family.  You&#39;ll have to ask her about the others,
although again I truly don&#39;t think she&#39;s trying to pull a fast one anybody.
Umm, speaking of the others.... you mind if I ask you a question about why some
of them are flagged as well?&quot; she inquired with a gesture to the folders still
stacked on his desk.
     &quot;Contrary to what you may think,&quot; Mr. Burrow said slowly, &quot;I don&#39;t play
the favorites game when it comes to my client&#39;s privacy and confidentiality.
While you may safely assume that you are not the only &#39;special&#39; account I keep
close tabs on for security reasons, you can also count on the fact that I am
not going to vacate my duty to ensure that their privacy is protected from the
eyes of others.  Unless you have a judicial subpoena, I will not hesitate to
smack your hand with a ruler if you try to touch them again, celebrity status
be damned.&quot;
     V blinked, her eyebrows arching up towards her hairline.  &quot;What kind of
ruler?&quot; she hedged, blinking again as a desk drawer was opened up and an old
metal ruler was held up in the air.  &quot;Ohhhhhh, boy,&quot; she breathed as she gave
him a look that was both amused and unsettled at the same time.  &quot;What&#39;d you
do, borrow that from a Catholic school or something?  You know, the discipline
tool of choice, endorsed by Sister Helga of Our Lady of the Iron Ruler?&quot;
     A faint chuckle rose up from his chest as he set the ruler down on the
desk and studied it absently.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; he murmured quietly.  &quot;But no
matter, young lady, you have your secrets and they have theirs.  Perhaps theirs
are not as.... dramatic as yours, but they all have equal weight from where I
sit and will be treated equally.  Surely you can understand and respect that,&quot;
he added in a faintly reproving tone.
     V absently chewed on the edge of her lower lip.  &quot;And if I said I already
know more about Leda Kino&#39;s life than you probably do?&quot; she ventured.
     &quot;Then what is there to ask if you already know?&quot; he inquired casually.
     &quot;There is one question,&quot; she assured him as she leaned forward to rest her
elbows on her knees.  &quot;Y&#39;see, Leda and I are good friends at school and all.
Crossroads High, just started the freshman year.  I know why she pays a visit
to the cemetery on Twelfth Street every so often, and I&#39;ve always wondered just
who in the grand scheme of things did the behind-the-scenes work to keep her
life from being completely uprooted.  Knowing what lengths you&#39;ve gone to for
my sake and knowing how many of them took place out of the spotlight, I don&#39;t
suppose you could be that presently-nameless individual?  I mean, that *would*
explain why both she and I are red-flagged like that, if you&#39;re the one riding
shotgun over her financial status,&quot; she added as the bank executive remained
perfectly silent and completely expressionless.
     &quot;It is the policy of this institution,&quot; he said with deliberate slowness
and precision in each word, &quot;Not to comment in any way, shape, or form on the
private accounts of individuals and corporations whom have placed their trust
in us to safeguard their financial information.  We will, of course, comply
with a properly-served judicial subpoena within the bounds required by law, but
under no circumstances will third-party individuals be privy to any of the
information therein.  Therefore, Ms. Aino, I can neither confirm nor deny any
of the allegations you have made, nor answer in any way any the questions you
are trying to pose to me.  Have I made myself perfectly clear, young lady?&quot;
     A disappointed sigh rose up from V&#39;s chest as she sat back in the chair
and tried not to cringe.  &quot;Clear as crystal, Mr. Burrow,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Well,
seeing how you&#39;re not going to answer me, I&#39;d like to thank you on the off-the-
wall chance that I am right.  Leda has her faults, as do we all, but she is one
of my best friends and I am extremely grateful for whatever strings were pulled
by whomever to let her continue to live her life like that.  It&#39;s a hell of a
way to live from my view, but I know it&#39;s what she wants so I&#39;m all for her
rocking on with her big, bad, independent-minded self.&quot;
     The bank executive studied her in silence for a moment before making the
slightest of nodding motions.  &quot;Yes, I would agree that Ms. Kino is very much
an independent young lady, and that her legal guardian has taken great pains to
level the balance that life as a whole seems to have unjustly tipped at several
points in her life,&quot; he said in a very carefully controlled tone.  &quot;I trust I
need not admonish you not to mention any of this to anyone else, given the
delicate nature of Ms. Kino&#39;s current legal status as a guarded minor?&quot;
     &quot;Hey, I told you, she&#39;s one of my best friends,&quot; V replied as she gave him
a slightly unamused look.  &quot;Believe me when I say I&#39;m not about to do anything
that would get her panties in a knot.  And not just because of her aggressive
streak, either,&quot; she added with a faintly sour expression before seeming to
sober up slightly.  &quot;So why did your computer flag Ami&#39;s name along with Leda
and myself?  Oh, come on,&quot; she protested when Mr. Burrow simply sighed and gave
her a fatherly look of disapproval that all children readily recognized.  &quot;I&#39;m
trying to help you here, okay?  I really do know all these people.&quot;
     Mr. Burrow continued to glare at her for a few moments before a truly
heavy sigh drifted up from the depths of his chest.  He reached out to scoop up
the stack of folders and started to sift through them.  &quot;Surely you know who
Ms. Mizuno&#39;s mother is,&quot; he said slowly as he quickly skimmed the application
that had been filed under Ami&#39;s name.
     &quot;Doctor Amelia Anderson,&quot; Sailor V replied instantly.  &quot;One of this city&#39;s
premier trauma surgeons and a *very* hard-working lady.  She&#39;s a little on the
stiff side, but that&#39;s just her German heritage showing despite her absolutely
gorgeous hair.  I&#39;m glad she went into medicine instead of education,&quot; she
added, prompting a questioning look from the banker.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s
obvious where Ami gets her brains from, but Doc Anderson strikes me as the type
who would be a hellaciously stern schoolmarm if you give her the chance....&quot;
     Mr. Burrow simply nodded, having privately reached that same conclusion on
his own after his surgery and subsequent recovery in her care.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say
that I am well-acquainted with Dr. Anderson myself, and not just because she
happens to do business with us.  Believe me when I say I am fully aware of who
she is, who her daughter is, and who has legal authority to try to open an
account in her daughter&#39;s name,&quot; he added in a tone of warning.
     &quot;Oopsie,&quot; V said with a faint hint of a smile on her face.  &quot;Susan&#39;s going
to have fun explaining that one.  But then again, knowing Susan, she just might
have a perfectly valid explanation.  I&#39;m still putting the pieces together in
my head as to how everyone&#39;s tied together,&quot; she said as she gestured to the
stack of folders, &quot;But I think I might know the bottom line here.  That one
with the yellow flag.... that&#39;s Darian, right?  Another satisfied customer?&quot;
     &quot;As far as I know,&quot; the bank executive said simply as he glanced down at
the folder that contained Darian&#39;s information.
     &quot;Ahhh, I get it now,&quot; V purred with a smile.  She nearly jumped out of the
chair when there was a soft knock on the office door, causing both her and Mr.
Burrow to look up in surprise at one another.  &quot;No way....&quot; V said as she cast
a visibly disturbed look towards the door.
     &quot;Yes?&quot; Mr. Burrow called out in a guarded tone.
     &quot;Excuse me for interrupting,&quot; Susan said as she eased the door open just
enough to reveal her presence.  &quot;But I believe I was asked to make a personal
appearance to settle a few concerns?&quot;
     &quot;Wow,&quot; Sailor V said as she made a show of glancing down at her wrist.
&quot;So much for the local speed laws.  You had to have been doing what, ninety to
get here this quickly?&quot;
     &quot;You would be surprised at how fast one can travel when the streets are
empty and the traffic lights are all cooperatively green,&quot; Susan said demurely.
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Mr. Burrow said as he stood up.  &quot;So you would be Ms. Meiou, I take
it?  Please, come in and have a seat,&quot; he added with a gesture.  &quot;I am James
Burrow, Senior Vice President for International Affairs.&quot;
     &quot;Susan Meiou,&quot; Susan replied with a bow of her head as she stepped into
the office to take the indicated seat.  &quot;I apologize for the lateness of this
visit, Mr. Burrow,&quot; she said as she absently smoothed out the dark green dress
she was wearing, &quot;But I received Sailor V&#39;s message and felt that it would be
best to resolve this matter as quickly as possible given the seriousness of the
situation.&quot;
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Mr. Burrow said in a neutral tone.  He cast a warning glance at
Sailor V before returning his focus to Susan.  &quot;There is a storm gathering on
the horizon,&quot; he said calmly, causing V to blink hard.
     Susan visibly hesitated for a moment before clearing her throat.  &quot;I trust
you will forgive me, Mr. Burrow, but I am.... still coming to terms with my....
shall we say, relationship with Sailor V, and so....&quot;
     &quot;Meaning you forgot the code phrase already,&quot; V spoke up with a sigh.
     &quot;It seems I have,&quot; Susan replied with only the slightest pause, giving the
blonde girl a somewhat abashed look.
     &quot;I told you she&#39;s new to this,&quot; V muttered to Mr. Burrow before taking a
deep breath.  &quot;You really, really need to remember this, Susan.  When someone
says &#39;there is a storm gathering on the horizon&#39; and you really aren&#39;t in the
middle of a conversation about the actual weather, you need to reply &#39;but the
winds are calm for the moment&#39; so the other guy knows you work for me.&quot;
     Susan nodded sullenly.  &quot;I shall endeavor to remember,&quot; she promised.
     &quot;I see,&quot; Mr. Burrow said quietly, giving Susan a somewhat wary look.  &quot;I
will be blunt with you, Ms. Meiou, you have an awful lot of explaining to do
about these account filings you submitted earlier.&quot;
     &quot;Would you prefer the short version or the long version?&quot; Susan said with
a simple shrug of her shoulders.
     Mr. Burrow sat back down in his chair and gave her a steady and somewhat
piercing look.  &quot;Let&#39;s start with the short version for now,&quot; he replied.  &quot;I&#39;m
sure I don&#39;t need to cite chapter and verse regarding attempted fraud and all
the associated consequences, as no doubt Sailor V has already warned you ahead
of time, so let&#39;s get to the heart of the matter as quickly as possible.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Susan said before taking a deep breath that put a moderate
amount of strain on the front of her dark blouse.  &quot;The short version is that
my aunt recently passed away and I am making use of a recently rediscovered
family fortune to see that her non-binding will is executed according to her
last known wishes, one of which being the establishment of financial resources
for a number of individuals known to her either directly or through her secret
association with Sailor V.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Mr. Burrow said an instant before V shot to her feet.
     &quot;Whoa, hold the phone,&quot; V blurted out, giving Susan a truly startled look.
&quot;Just what exactly are we talking about here?&quot;
     &quot;My aunt Rose, of course,&quot; Susan replied calmly.  &quot;It seems her life was
one of the first ones you saved during that unpleasantness in Liverpool two
years ago, only she never told anyone else and kept that secret hidden away in
a diary which I only discovered last week.&quot;
     &quot;Wait, wait, wait,&quot; V said rapidly as her face turned pale.  &quot;Rose?  You
mean Lady Rosemary Williams?  She&#39;s your aunt?  You never mentioned that!&quot;
     &quot;As I said, discovering that she had already made your acquaintance was a
very recent development and one that occured shortly after you and I had met,&quot;
Susan replied quietly.  &quot;In any regard, there are several entries in her diary
regarding her regular correspondence with you through letters and the oddly
random phone call.  In two of the entries she listed people she expressed a
desire to &#39;look out for&#39; for various reasons.  The first category regarded a
number of people she wished she could meet for herself that she knew you had
befriended at some point in time, people like Ami, Serena, and Rei.  The other
category dealt with several individuals who were known to be orphans that she
had the pleasure of hosting for a short period of time, such as Alexis and
Michelle, or had likewise heard of through you, such as Leda and Darian.&quot;
     V cast a quick glance over at Mr. Burrow to see how he was reacting to the
current conversation.  &quot;See, I told you she had a method to her madness,&quot; she
murmured before looking back at Susan.  &quot;I remember her mentioning her hosting
house-guests every so often, but I must have missed out on the orphan part.  I
know I remember talking about Darian growing up in an orphanage, but I&#39;m pretty
sure I didn&#39;t go into detail about Leda....&quot;
     The green-haired woman simply shrugged.  &quot;I can show you what she wrote in
her diary at a later date, if you wish,&quot; she offered before returning her focus
to the bank executive.  &quot;In any regard, Mr. Burrow, my intention was to execute
my aunt&#39;s will to the best of my ability and felt that establishing a monetary
account for the named individuals would be the best method of doing so.&quot;
     &quot;You could have said something first,&quot; V muttered darkly before Mr. Burrow
could draw in a breath to reply.  &quot;You know, like asked us ahead of time for
permission to pull a stunt like this?&quot;
     &quot;I will admit to having acted in undue haste,&quot; Susan admitted with a very
faint blush.  &quot;However, as these are essentially trustee accounts filed on
behalf of my aunt&#39;s estate, explicit permission of the named individual is not
needed for the initial setup and allocation of funds.  To activate the account
and permit access, however, requires the submission of a separate form which
indeed requires your signature and legal consent.  I was planning on discussing
that aspect with each of you once I am able to meet with you as a group to let
you know that the accounts have been established for you and explain why.&quot;
     &quot;Excuse me for a moment here, Ms. Meiou....&quot; Mr. Burrow started to say as
he grabbed the topmost folder in the stack and flipped it open to examine the
application in detail.  &quot;While you are somewhat correct about trustee accounts,
the applications I have here are for dual checking-and-savings accounts....&quot;
     &quot;Which are all drawn from the executive trustee account I have established
with the main branch of my aunt&#39;s bank in London,&quot; Susan interrupted smoothly.
&quot;All that I am doing in Japan is establishing a subset of accounts for the
proper allocation and purely administrative oversight of the trustee funds.  At
no time are the funds outside of the scope of the estate trust, and thus are
governed by the rules of such funds.  Even the initial allocations themselves
are pre-determined ahead of time as for what purposes they may be used and in
what amounts.  While I am the executor of the estate trust, my instructions are
clearly spelled out in my aunt&#39;s will.  There is no fraud or malice to be found
in my actions, Mr. Burrow, merely an initial less-than-ideal execution,&quot; she
added in a faintly cool tone as she leaned back in the chair and folded her
hands over her lap.
     A small frown crossed Sailor V&#39;s face as she watched the bank executive
open up Susan&#39;s application folder to study in detail.  &quot;So let me get this
right,&quot; she said quietly to Susan.  &quot;You were going to just set up a number of
special bank accounts for everyone, then come along and tell us about it after
the fact?&quot;
     &quot;As I said,&quot; Susan said carefully in a tone of crafted patience, &quot;I will
readily admit to being less-than-exemplary in my planning, but you need to bear
in mind that I am working with a frustratingly narrow timetable.  Alexis and
Michelle have already arrived in-country and have yet to be established in a
proper place of residence, which is not something that can be done unless they
have access to the accounts I am attempting to set up.  I myself am likewise in
the midst of relocating my residence to a more favorable setting, and suffice
it to say that I was not prepared for the rediscovery of my ancestor&#39;s fortune
in England.  That in of itself is enough to preoccupy me, and I still have a
business to maintain on top of my new.... obligations to you,&quot; she added with
just the right amount of uncertainty.
     &quot;Busy lady,&quot; V commented absently, casting a quick sidelong glance at the
bank executive&#39;s still-suspicious expression.  &quot;Might explain why you wound up
wandering down the wrong alley in the middle of the night, but no matter.  You
look like you just ate a dead rat, James,&quot; she spoke up.  &quot;Everything okay?&quot;
     &quot;Yes and no,&quot; Mr. Burrow said as he lifted his head up from the paperwork
and gave Susan a somewhat unreadable look.  &quot;From what I can tell, the actual
forms are all properly filled out, which doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least.  I
notice that the wire transfer from the Bank of England has already been deemed
valid and is indeed marked as coming from an estate trust account.  If I were
to accept your explanation at face-value, everything would seem to be perfectly
acceptable and should be taken care of by close-of-business Thursday.  Access
to said funds would be denied pending the validated signatures, of course.&quot;
     &quot;Of course,&quot; Susan murmured demurely, giving him a neutral look.  &quot;I get
the feeling that you, however, are not personally satisfied with the current
situation or my explanation of events.&quot;
     &quot;Ms. Meiou, I don&#39;t know how old you are, but I&#39;m willing to bet I&#39;ve been
in the financial business longer than you&#39;ve been alive,&quot; Mr. Burrow said as he
leaned back in his chair and rested his hands on his abdomen, giving the green-
haired woman a distinctly unsettled look.
     &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Susan allowed with a slight tilt of her head.
     &quot;In any case,&quot; the bank executive continued, &quot;I&#39;ve learned over the years
to trust what my instincts are telling me.  Quite frankly, Ms. Meiou, right now
my instincts are telling me that something is very, very wrong with this entire
situation.&quot;
     &quot;Answer me this, Mr. Burrow, if you please,&quot; Susan replied in a cordial
tone.  &quot;If this is indeed a case of fraud, as you have suggested, then what do
I stand to gain from this whole endeavor?  My aunt&#39;s will was non-binding, so
I am free to do what I wish with the family fortune I have inherited.  It is
out of respect for my aunt&#39;s wishes that I am doing this, not because I happen
to owe Sailor V my life.  That debt will be repaid in a different manner, as
like you, I can offer her services that few others can provide that will be to
her ultimate benefit in the future.  And, it seems, to the benefit of several
of her friends as well,&quot; she added.  &quot;But not, however, to my own benefit, or
at least not a financial one.  So again, I ask you, what do I gain from this
whole endeavor if I am purportedly doing this for fraudulent reasons?&quot;
     &quot;Hey, umm, can I get a word in edgewise here?&quot; Sailor V spoke up quickly.
     &quot;If you think it&#39;s necessary,&quot; the bank executive replied with a shrug.
     That caused V to pause for a few moments and exchange uneasy glances with
Susan before continuing.  &quot;Like I said earlier, it would have been nice if she
had clued me in to this surprise before dropping this little bomb into my lap,
but I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s not being shady about things.  I mean, it&#39;s ironic as
hell that I first saved her aunt&#39;s bacon back in England two years ago, back
before I started keeping a proverbial little black book about whom I saved and
all, and recently saved Susan&#39;s backside from a really nasty situation just the
other week.  Talk about your small worlds and all, but anyway.  And yes, Lady
Rosemary was just as sweet as could be and was a wonderful pen-pal.  So maybe
I did say a few things about my friends here in Japan and how they kept the
girl behind this mask largely sane and out of trouble,&quot; she said with a gesture
to her oversized Sailor V Transformation Glasses.  &quot;That probably touched her
heart, and you know how sentimental little old English ladies can be.&quot;
     Mr. Burrow raised an eyebrow at her before sighing quietly and returning
his focus to Susan.  &quot;Very well,&quot; he said in a somber tone.  &quot;I still believe
something is not right about this whole situation, so here is how things are
going to go: I will go ahead and allow the trust funds to be set up according
to the written application instructions,&quot; he said, gesturing to the stack of
folders.  &quot;However, I am going to very firmly insist that the access forms be
signed in front of me, right here in this office, by the named individuals in
these forms.  And if they are legal minors, both they and their legal guardians
will need to be present.  And in this case, Sailor V?&quot; he started to add.
     &quot;Oh, wait, no you don&#39;t,&quot; V immediately protested with a frown.  &quot;You are
so not getting my parents involved in this one, no sir.  We have a deal, for
all matters pertaining to Sailor V and her financial business you have full
legal authority to sign off on things.&quot;
     &quot;For Sailor V, yes,&quot; he countered.  &quot;However, I don&#39;t see Sailor V on this
application, I see someone else&#39;s name.  Someone whom I know without a doubt is
not legally old enough to enter into a financial contract on her own.  I rarely
regret making our deal to safeguard your alter-ego&#39;s finances, young lady, but
this one is outside the scope of our agreement and so I&#39;m going to have to be
quite firm in insisting that everything be above-board and in the clear.&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t suppose the rigidity of your requirements can be negotiated?&quot;
Susan inquired in a light tone, prompting a blink from V and a scowl from the
bank executive.
     &quot;Ms. Meiou,&quot; Mr. Burrow said in a distinctly frosty tone, &quot;If you think I
am going to be flexible on principles....&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps you may wish to hear me out first?&quot; Susan interrupted politely
with a subtle gesture of her hand.  &quot;As we are both business individuals, I am
certain that you understand my situation when I say that time is money and that
my time is very much in short supply at the moment.  If an understanding cannot
be reached tonight so that the accounts can be fully established by the end of
this week, then I will be forced to seek the aid of a slightly more cooperative
financial institution to help resolve the issue of the accounts in a far more
timely manner.
     &quot;However,&quot; she quickly added as his jaw suddenly set into a dark line, &quot;I
have come here at the advice of a trusted business associate in England and do
not wish to settle for a lesser institution.  It would be quite beneficial for
the both of us to conduct business together, as I expect in the coming months
to be in a position to act as a facilitator for a number of business deals on
behalf of Sailor V as her public relations agent.  At least, that will be my
overt role.&quot;
     The only thing that kept V both seated and silent was the sudden feeling
of the toe of Susan&#39;s high-heeled shoe lightly pressing down on her own toes.
The blonde cast a very brief sidelong glance at the other woman before sighing
very carefully through her nose, wondering just sort of landmine was about to
be stepped on in the next five minutes.
     &quot;Really, now,&quot; Mr. Burrow said in an utterly flat and unreadable tone, his
expression likewise cast into a hard-to-read mien.
     &quot;As I said,&quot; Susan continued, &quot;I have recently become indebted to Sailor
V and will be paying off that debt by examining her list of.... &#39;friends of the
family&#39; I believe is how she phrased it, and attempting to construct a useful
and productive organization that will not just benefit the &#39;members&#39; of the
association but will raise a substantial amount of resources for charity work
in the process.  Any such network will require extensive corporate contacts, of
course, but in this case I truly believe it will be in everybody&#39;s interests if
such an arrangement were kept out of the public view given the sensitive nature
of how we are all associated to begin with.  A veil of privacy, if you will,&quot;
she added with another gesture of her hand.
     &quot;Go on,&quot; Mr. Burrow said after she had fallen silent for several moments.
     &quot;Your involvement in this still-theoretical association would of course be
purely voluntary,&quot; Susan explained with the faintest hint of a smile on her
lips.  &quot;After all, you are already performing one task of great significance,
so it would be rather unfair to impose another upon you.  However, if you were
to agree to be a part of this, I&#39;m sure that it would result in a modest but
still discernible increase in monetary transactions through your institution,
which would of course be to your benefit.  This, of course, all hinges on how
cooperative you wish to be and how much &#39;behind-the-scenes&#39; work you are both
willing and able to perform.  I can assure you without the slightest doubt that
you will never be asked to do anything illegal for anyone, but there may come
a time when something needs to be accomplished that falls within a gray area of
legal understanding that would require both discretion and judgment.&quot;
     Mr. Burrow simply sighed quietly to himself, having long ago learned how
to read between the lines with the best of business executives.  &quot;Minor tasks,
I trust, such as ignoring a feeling of suspicion about opening a series of bank
accounts that could easily be fraudulent?&quot; he spoke up in an openly weary tone.
     Susan simply shook her head, still very discreetly keeping the edge of her
foot pressed against Sailor V&#39;s orange sandals.  &quot;No, Mr. Burrow, neither I nor
Sailor V would ever ask you to do anything fraudulent.  In the case of the
accounts I wish to open with you, it is simply a matter of needing to have the
situation dealt with as expediently as possible without actually breaking any
established laws of finance or commerce.  I will provide notarized copies of
the permission forms for accessing the accounts when the time comes.  I simply
ask that you not add to the burden-of-proof beyond what is customarily required
of such individuals.&quot;
     &quot;And if I refuse?&quot; he asked calmly.
     Susan merely shrugged in reply.  &quot;Then I withdraw the applications, take
my business and that of my aunt&#39;s will elsewhere, and not bother you in the
future with any business opportunities or ventures that I come across.  Your
deal with Sailor V remains between you and her, of course, and I will leave it
up to her to continue matters.&quot;
     &quot;There&#39;s still the concern of the applications to begin with,&quot; he pointed
out in a faintly ominous tone.  &quot;They are already on record and could still be
turned over to the appropriate authorities for possible investigation as being
attempted fraud.&quot;
     A gentle smile crossed Susan&#39;s face as she steepled her fingertips, a look
that was both dark and smug at the same time.  &quot;You could do that,&quot; she allowed
with a slight gesture of her head.  &quot;However, that would most likely result in
a lawsuit of one form or another.  I take my reputation very, very seriously,
you see, and I&#39;m sure the Bank of Japan would not like to become mired in any
sort of litigation with the potential for some very negative public relations.
Imagine the spin, a massive international bank thwarting the will of a deceased
English widow who only wanted to help people who were dear to her heart.  The
press would have a field day, don&#39;t you think?&quot;
     Both Susan and Sailor V watched in silence as Mr. Burrow opened up a small
drawer behind his desk to pull out a small cigar holder.  A simple flick of his
fingertips lifted the lid up and an almost spasmodic twitch of his other wrist
expelled the half-burned stub of a rather expensive Cuban cigar.  It only took
another brief moment to procure a lighter and even less time to apply the small
but intense jet of blue flame to the burnt end of his occasional vice.
     &quot;You know, Ms. Meiou,&quot; he said as he tossed the lighter back into the
drawer and leaned back in his chair, absently puffing a small cloud of blue-
tinted smoke up towards the ceiling, &quot;Just between you and me, if Sailor V
would be so kind as to plug her ears for a moment, I well and truly hope like
hell I don&#39;t ever have to see you in my office like this again.  To be blunt,
young lady, you&#39;re starting to scare the hell out of me.  I&#39;m almost inclined
to believe you&#39;re trying to blackmail me.&quot;
     &quot;Forgive me if I seem.... overly aggressive,&quot; Susan said demurely as she
folded her hands in her lap.  &quot;Being both a small-business administrator and a
woman in a highly-competitive environment dominated by massive corporations run
almost exclusively by men, I&#39;ve learned that if I want to survive I need to
make sure I have an impact.  Sometimes that means leaving teeth marks on my
competitors.&quot;
     Sailor V seemed to shiver lightly.  &quot;Now there&#39;s a visual I really didn&#39;t
need to have seared into my mind,&quot; she grumbled quietly as she gently edged her
foot out from beneath Susan&#39;s.
     &quot;It is a simple case of reciprocity, Mr. Burrow,&quot; Susan said to the bank
executive, pointedly ignoring V&#39;s comment.  &quot;Or if you prefer, a reflection of
willingness and effort.  If you can perform this minor business favor for me,
I am more than willing to repay you in kind once I am in a position to do so.
Should you decide that it is not in your best interests to do business, I will
simply walk away and let the matter rest.  And should anyone go out of their
way to complicate my life needlessly.... well, that can be reciprocated in kind
as well,&quot; she added lightly.  &quot;You may find that the Golden Rule of doing unto
others as you would have them do unto you applies just as well in the realm of
business as it does in schoolyard playgrounds and other social environs.&quot;
     A somewhat substantial cloud of smoke was expelled from his nostrils as
he sighed quietly, giving Sailor V a studious look for a number of moments
before returning his focus to Susan.  &quot;Remind me not to ever play cards with
you, Ms. Meiou,&quot; he finally said after a lengthy period of silence.
     &quot;A pity,&quot; Susan said with a soft smile.  &quot;I am somewhat fond of playing 
poker, although I have been told I sometimes play a little too seriously.&quot;
     &quot;Now that I believe,&quot; Sailor V piped up.
     &quot;And how much of a gambler are you, Ms. Meiou?&quot; Mr. Burrow inquired.
     Susan made an absent gesture of dismissal.  &quot;That depends on what is at
stake.  I have no hesitation of playing simply for the fun of playing.... even
if I have been known to lose my shirt and then some in certain friendly games,&quot;
she said casually, causing Mr. Burrow to raise an eyebrow and Sailor V to bite
the tip of her tongue to keep herself from making an off-color comment.  &quot;What
I do not do, however, is gamble with anything of personal importance, and I
certainly do not gamble with the assets of my clients.&quot;
     The banker took a protracted puff from his cigar before reaching over to
tap the ashes into the trash can and stamp out the burning tip.  He then sat
back to exhale slowly once again, creating a large haze of blue-tinted smoke as
he idly returned the stub of his cigar back to the storage case.
     &quot;Alright, let&#39;s try it like this,&quot; he said carefully.  &quot;Notarized copies
of the signature forms will suffice.  I will sign off on Mina&#39;s form if she
really wants me to, since we already have an understanding in place.  You, of
course, can sign off on your own form.  I do have two restrictions that I am
going to insist on, however.  The first is that Mr. Chiba comes to my office to
sign his paperwork, as he already has a dual savings-and-checking account with
us and would need to have some additional paperwork filed to integrate the two
given the limitations of the original estate trust.  It should take maybe ten
or fifteen minutes of his time at most.&quot;
     Susan nodded in understanding.  &quot;I&#39;m sure that can be easily arranged.&quot;
     &quot;Second, I&#39;m going to insist on Dr. Anderson co-signing her daughter&#39;s
paperwork,&quot; Mr. Burrow continued as he sat up straight and gave Susan a level
look.  &quot;As I explained to Sailor V earlier, I personally know Dr. Anderson and
with her being one of our more prestigious customers I feel I would be doing
her a great disservice if I were to knowingly allow something to take place
that involved her daughter without her knowledge or consent.&quot;
     Susan simply nodded again.  &quot;That will take a day or two, given the good
doctor&#39;s work schedule, but I will obtain that for you before the end of the
week.  Bless you,&quot; she added as Sailor V seemed to half-sneeze and half-choke
on a random air molecule at the same time.
     &quot;Gooooooood luck with that one,&quot; V warned, giving the succubus an openly
uneasy look that she knew didn&#39;t require further elaboration.
     &quot;You need not worry, Sailor V,&quot; Susan assured her gently, &quot;I will be sure
not to disrupt either Dr. Anderson&#39;s schedule or Ami&#39;s studying.&quot;
     &quot;Like I said, good luck with that,&quot; V replied with a faint smirk.
     Susan shot her a partially amused look before looking back over at the
bank executive sitting across from her.  &quot;I trust that will be sufficient for
your needs, Mr. Burrow?&quot; she inquired lightly.
     &quot;By and large, yes,&quot; the banker replied in a somber tone.  He paused for
a moment before leaning forward, his expression seemed to darken slightly.  &quot;I
should like to warn you now, however.... I *will* know if you happen to try to
falsify anything, and I assure you that any such attempt to do so will result
in severe consequences.&quot;
     &quot;But of course,&quot; Susan said as she gave him a somewhat disturbing smile of
both understanding and triumph.  &quot;What use are laws without proper enforcement
and penalties for violations?  You need not worry, I have more respect for the
rule of law than you can imagine, or at least more so than our mutual associate
here does....&quot; she added with a casual gesture beside her.
     &quot;HEY!&quot; V immediately protested, giving Susan a hurt look.
     &quot;I don&#39;t mean any offense, of course,&quot; the green-haired woman continued
with a faint smile, &quot;I am merely pointing out that you will not find me cloaked
in the shadows of the night picking the pocket of an adversary before sending
him along on his merry way.  A bold move, granted,&quot; she added, ignoring the way
V&#39;s face was taking on a distinctly purple hue of outrage, &quot;But perhaps not the
most ethical means of recovering stolen property.  In any case, Mr. Burrow, I
do thank you for hearing me out and giving me the chance to explain myself,&quot;
she said as she stood up and smoothed out a wrinkle in her dark skirt, still
actively ignoring the look on Sailor V&#39;s face.  &quot;And I trust my.... aggressive
style of business negotiations has not resulted in any ill-will or personal
feelings of harm?&quot;
     &quot;Like I said, Ms. Meiou, just don&#39;t ever expect me to sit down with you to
play a game of cards,&quot; the bank executive replied in a weary tone, keeping a
leery eye on the parade of emotions running rampant across V&#39;s face.  &quot;If all
goes as smoothly as you say it will, I don&#39;t see why either of us will have a
reason to remember the details of this conversation for future reference.  V,
if you&#39;re going to have a nose-bleed, kindly take it outside before you ruin
the carpeting,&quot; he added with a gesture towards the door.
     &quot;No, no, I&#39;m fine,&quot; V assured him with a cheerful smile that seemed to be
quite out-of-place when compared to her expression a split-second before she
had spoken up.  &quot;Moments like these are like accupuncture therapy.  You know,
having a needle stuck in the right place here and there can do things like get
the blood flowing and clear up the sinuses and all.  The true secret isn&#39;t so
much where you jab the needle but how you twist it just so.  But anyway,&quot; she
babbled as she likewise stood up and started to shoo Susan towards the door.
&quot;Thanks for the head&#39;s-up about this mess, sorry to have kept you up so late,
give my regards to your wife, and if you can net me another five-percent return
on my investments this quarter like you did the last one I&#39;ll be sending you an
extra-special-happy Christmas card come the winter solstice.  Come on, Susan,
we still have a bit of work to do tonight, let&#39;s get going,&quot; she prodded as she
all but physically shoved her out the door.
     Susan simply sighed.  &quot;Patience is a virtue, Sailor V,&quot; she spoke up.
     &quot;Pity I got rid of my.... oh, wait,&quot; V started to say before pausing to
glance over her shoulder at Mr. Burrow, her cheeks taking on a pink tint of
embarrassment.  &quot;Wrong conversation choice.  No matter, it&#39;s not your business
anyway.  Take care, James!&quot; she said in a sing-song tone as she cleared the
doorway and casually closed the door behind her.
     &quot;Good night, Mina,&quot; the banker said in a truly weary tone before the door
clicked shut, leaving Sailor V and Susan alone in the outer office.
     &quot;Mina, perhaps we should....&quot; Susan started to say before V reached up to
clamp a white-gloved hand over the other woman&#39;s mouth.
     &quot;Not here,&quot; V growled in a truly dark tone.  &quot;But yes, we need to have a
very open and blunt conversation in the next five minutes, preferably somewhere
else where we won&#39;t be overheard.  And the cathedral just isn&#39;t going to cut it
since I know the computer listens to everything we say just in case we start
trying to issue it verbal commands.&quot;
     Susan coolly raised an eyebrow as she edged V&#39;s hand away from her mouth.
&quot;Very well then,&quot; she said calmly.  &quot;Where do you wish to go?&quot;
     &quot;Right now, I don&#39;t care where the hell we go,&quot; V countered.  &quot;Just as
long as it&#39;s someplace quiet and remote and far from here.&quot;
     &quot;As you wish,&quot; Susan replied as she made a snatching motion at the air.
The Key to Time promptly materialized out of the temporal flow, seeming to be
plucked out of thin air as it gently slapped into her palm.  The silvery staff
was then offered so that V could take hold of it, a gesture that promptly drew
an uneasy look from the blonde before she accepted.
     &quot;Hey, where....&quot; V started to say as her fingers curled around the staff.
The world around them suddenly flashed for the briefest of instants as Susan
sent them through a conduit and into the flow of Time, resulting in a momentary
feeling of dizziness before their surroundings refocused into four-dimensional
space once again.
     &quot;.... are we going?&quot; V finished softly as she paused and looked around.
They appeared to be in an underground cavern of some sort, one with a fairly
high ceiling and naturally smooth stony walls.  Several yards away was a truly
massive wrought-iron gate, the kind one might see standing guard over medieval
cemetaries or castles.  A large bronze gong was situated a few feet away from
the hinges, and beyond the gate was a small wooden pier that jutted out over
what appeared to be a river of black ink that left hideous stains on both the
dock and the surrounding rocky shoreline.  A series of torches set into heavy
iron sconces lined the walls, providing a dimly-lit path from the closed gate
towards a small tunnel-like exit some distance away.  A light fog permeated
everything, leaving the air more than a little damp and chilly.
     Sailor V gave Susan a truly uneasy look as she continued to survey their
new surroundings, unable to dispel a feeling of dark dread that was beginning
to seep into both her bones and her soul.  &quot;Hey, uh, Susan?&quot; she finally said
in an unusually subdued tone.  &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be a wet rag or anything, but
someone around here obviously doesn&#39;t watch Martha Stewart&#39;s Home Living on the
weekends.  Where exactly are we?&quot;
     &quot;Where you wished to be,&quot; Susan replied in a neutral, almost empty tone.
     &quot;Right....&quot; V said, still visibly unsettled by something.  She cast a
measured look at the closed iron gate and the dark waters beyond before turning
her full attention back to the succubus.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll admit it, this is pretty
remote and all, but this place is creeping me out now.  Where are we?&quot;
     &quot;The Gate of the Arbiter,&quot; Susan explained with a gesture of her staff.
&quot;You said you didn&#39;t care where in Hell we went, did you not?&quot;
     &quot;Yabut....&quot; V started to say before the realization hit her with all the
grace and force of a sandbag filled with shotgun pellets.  &quot;W-W-Wait....&quot; she
stammered as she raised a suddenly-trembling finger to point at the gate.  &quot;Is
that what I think it is?&quot;
     Susan tilted her head slightly to study the blonde.  &quot;And that being...?&quot;
she prompted in a somewhat disinterested tone.
     &quot;YOU BROUGHT ME TO THE GATE OF HELL?!&quot; V blurted out in a genuine panic,
her blue eyes as wide as was physically possible.
     &quot;No, I haven&#39;t,&quot; Susan explained calmly.  &quot;The so-called &#39;Gate of Hell&#39;
that you are referring to lies deeper in the Underworld, nestled in the Elysian
Fields with the rest of the &#39;traditional&#39; afterlife realms.  What we are before
right now is merely one of the physical entrances into the Underworld, and a
rarely used gate at that.  This gate is traditionally only used to escort high-
profile souls into the afterlife, like those who ruled nations in life.  In any
case, Mina, we are still technically in the mortal plane as the border between
this realm and the Underworld lies further downstream and is only accessible
via the Ferry of the Damned.  Which, I might add, is forbidden from granting
passage to a living soul like you who isn&#39;t a native of the Underworld.&quot;
     &quot;That doesn&#39;t make me feel better!&quot; V shot back, still extremely upset and
close to hyperventilating.  &quot;Jesus H. Christ, Susan, did I take a piss in your
Wheaties this morning and not realize it?  Of all the places to pick for a cozy
heart-to-heart, *why the hell here?!*&quot;
     Susan closed her eyes briefly and sighed softly, a gentle exhalation of
air that seemed to age her several years before she took in another breath.
&quot;Like Alex,&quot; she said slowly and carefully, &quot;You need to learn to be aware of
what you say.  You said you wanted to talk in a remote place where we will not
be disturbed, and you likewise indicated that you did not care &#39;where in the
hell&#39; it was.  I took that to mean the choice was wholly mine, and given the
stress I have recently experienced I suppose my initial inclination was to find
a location that would be both comforting to me and complying with the isolation
that you appeared to desire.  Rest assured you will not find anything harmful
on this side of the gate,&quot; she added quietly.
     &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; the blonde replied, clearly not convinced in the least.  &quot;You
know what, demon?  I take it all back.  Go ahead and try to put me in the same
boat as Alex, I don&#39;t care.  We can hash it out later.  I can even wait until
tomorrow to discuss things with you.  Just get me out of here and back home to
the world as I know it before my bladder gives out, which it feels like it&#39;s
going to do any.... second....  Uh, Susan?&quot; she added in a truly uneasy tone as
she leaned back slightly to look past both Susan and the staff she was holding.
     Susan paused in mid-motion at the abrupt change in Sailor V&#39;s demeanor,
already in the process of reaching out with her staff to offer it to the blonde
again.  She noticed V looking behind her and quickly turned around, blinking
fairly hard as she saw a shrouded figure slowly leaving the access tunnel and
making its way towards their location.
     &quot;Odd,&quot; the succubus found herself saying, more than a little curious about
the new situation.  The figure was completely covered in a black shroud with
the hood pulled up, leaving her to guess at what sort of entity it was.  While
she knew that the Gate of the Arbiter was still &#39;in use&#39; as an active entrance
for souls into the Underworld, it was unheard of for any such soul to be alone
or otherwise unescorted during its journey.  That left her with the impression
that their guest was a native of the Underworld on a return trip, though from
where or even what the shrouded figure could be was very much a mystery.
     &quot;So much for privacy, eh?&quot; V muttered in a nervous tone as she absently
edged behind Susan, her nerves seeming to tingle near the breaking point from
sheer tension and lingering horror at the situation.  She blinked as a thought
finally surfaced in the depths of her mind, causing her to reach out and grab
the Key to Time and hold on as if her very life depended on it.  &quot;Beam me up,
Scotty, this isn&#39;t the men&#39;s room....&quot; she whispered quietly, more to herself
than to Susan.
     Susan cast a brief sidelong glance at her before returning her focus to
the approaching figure.  &quot;You are the avatar of Lady Aphrodite, Mina, and thus
a protected soul,&quot; she explained softly.  &quot;No agent or entity of any sort from
the Underworld will dare harm you.  Good evening,&quot; she called out as the figure
came within casual earshot.
     &quot;Good evening,&quot; a dulcet and somewhat deep feminine voice replied as she
came to a halt.  &quot;Forgive my insolence, but would that be the Key to Time which
you are wielding?&quot;
     &quot;It is,&quot; Susan replied carefully.
     &quot;So the rumors are true,&quot; the voice purred, taking on a faintly sibilant
aspect.  &quot;You have indeed returned to us, Guardian Susan.  Welcome back,&quot; she
said as she reached up, exposing her hands as she started to push her hood
back and thus reveal her face.
     Susan only needed an instantaneous glance at her hands to know what sort
of entity she was, able to recognize the tell-tale hint of green coloring and
the delicate, essentially invisible suggestion of reptilian scaling along the
otherwise flawlessly smooth expanse of her pale skin.  It took her an extra
moment to realize that, while she knew her unexpected guest would not actively
pose a danger to either her or Sailor V, it was highly likely that V would not
only fail to understand that but would experience a very bad initial reaction.
And if her bladder was as full as she had said it was....
     &quot;Mina, don&#39;t....&quot; she started to say as the dim torchlight fell across her
visitor&#39;s exposed face.  She simply closed her eyes and winced as the blonde
promptly yelped in genuine mortal fear, her pupils dilating so wide that the
blue coloring of her irises were essentially blotted out.  &quot;MINA!&quot; Susan said
sharply as she reached out, wrapping her arm around the blonde and hugging her
tightly in an embrace that was both protective and comforting.  &quot;You must trust
me when I say the legends are not what you think they are.  Settle down and do
not panic, she will not hurt you.&quot;
     &quot;T-T-The Lord is my s-s-shepherd,&quot; V murmured in a badly broken whisper to
herself, her body wracked with spasms of pure fright.  Her eyes were tightly
closed with faint glimmers of tears leaking out from the very edges, seeming to
be ready to spill down her cheeks at any moment.  &quot;I s-s-shall not want.  He
m-m-makes me lie down in green p-p-pastures....&quot;
     &quot;Mina, please listen,&quot; Susan said gently, absently commanding her staff to
slip back into the flow of Time.  &quot;I did not expect this, but you must believe
me when I say you will not be harmed.  Look at me.  Open your eyes and look at
me, you will not die.  I promise.&quot;
     It seemed to take the blonde a considerable effort for her to part her
eyelids, just enough to let Susan catch a fleeting glimpse of blue.  Sailor V
seemed to hesitate for several moments before drawing in a shuddering breath
and opening her eyes wider to the point of being able to see properly.
     &quot;Forgive me,&quot; the other woman said in a subdued tone as she moved to pull
her hood back down.  &quot;I did not mean....&quot;
     &quot;It is alright,&quot; Susan assured her softly with a shake of her head.  &quot;She
is the avatar of Lady Aphrodite, and in times past she would not have reacted
like this.  Mina, look at me,&quot; she murmured to V once again.  &quot;I would try to
explain this to you as I would to Ami or Leda, but like Alex you hear my words
and choose not to listen.  What you have been told about her kind is factually
incorrect.  Look at me and tell me why I am still alive if what you think is
the truth.&quot;
     V&#39;s eyes closed for several moments as she took in a deep breath, her body
still wracked with a series of mild twitches and spasms.  &quot;Yea, though I walk
through the shadows in the Valley of Death,&quot; she murmured as she suddenly stood
up straight and turned to face their still-unhooded visitor.  &quot;I will fear....
no.... evil....&quot; she whispered as she forced her eyes open.
     The briefest of icy twinges shot through Susan&#39;s veins as she thought that
Sailor V would simply pass out from sheer horror, but much to her relief the
blonde somehow managed to stand her ground with only the smallest of quivers in
her jaw to indicate that she was one moment removed from a complete and total
nervous breakdown.  She reached out to gently take hold of V&#39;s hand, ignoring
the pain of having her fingers almost instantly crushed by a terrified grip as
the blonde absently sought to hold on to something, anything that she could use
to keep her sanity firmly anchored in place.
     &quot;Good evening,&quot; their visitor said with a slight bow of her head.  The
gesture caused the mass of slender forest-green snakes on her scalp to gently
undulate back and forth before settling back down.  Two of the snakes seemed to
twitch for several additional moments before falling still with only a faint
hissing noise to suggest they were even alive.  Her irises were shaped like
those of a cat, black slits set against a background of pale yellow as they
studied both Susan and Sailor V with open curiosity and intrigue.
     &quot;A m-m-medusa....&quot; V whimpered quietly as she clutched Susan&#39;s hand even
harder than before, staring at the snake-hair in open horror.  &quot;Jesus Christ,
Susan....&quot;
     &quot;A gorgon,&quot; Susan corrected gently.  &quot;As you can see, simply looking at
her will not turn you to stone, kill, paralyze, or otherwise harm you in the
slightest.  Please, try to calm down.&quot;
     &quot;Forgive me,&quot; the gorgon purred with a faint hint of a smile, &quot;But I was
not aware that I was in the presence of a mortal.  My name is....&quot; she said,
followed by a truly harsh hissing word that V&#39;s human ears could barely make
out as a proper sound.  &quot;However, as few mortals can even speak our language,
you may call me Ciscerren if you wish,&quot; she added, pronouncing the name with a
somewhat exaggerated hiss.
     It took Sailor V several moments for her brain to calm down to the point
of letting her speak rationally and coherently.  &quot;H-H-Hi,&quot; she stammered as she
absently brushed her free hand over the short pleats of her skirt.  &quot;I&#39;m....
hell with it,&quot; she muttered before taking a deep breath and visibly rallying
herself.  &quot;Hi, I&#39;m Mina,&quot; she said in a louder voice as she did her best to
force a somewhat lighter expression on her face.  &quot;You.... ah.... caught me by
surprise there earlier, what with the.... ah, snakes and all....&quot;
     &quot;I would imagine so, mortal,&quot; Ciscerren replied with a bow of her head.
&quot;It has been centuries and centuries still since I was last allowed to walk
freely among your kind, unfettered and unbound by the chains that now hold me
and my sisters, so I can understand why meeting me would be a surprise.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s.... a minor understatement,&quot; V allowed with a weak smile,
her complexion still dangerously pale.  &quot;I mean, I know Halloween isn&#39;t too far
away and all, but.... Jesus Christ, Susan, help me here....&quot; she muttered as
her exterior of bravado briefly faltered.
     Susan cast a deeply concerned look at the blonde, not entirely sure what
to make of the way she was able to feign near-recovery despite clearly being
terrified on the inside.  &quot;All Hollow&#39;s Eve,&quot; Susan spoke up as she glanced
back at the gorgon and saw the faintly confused look on her face.  &quot;Only now
it is &#39;celebrated&#39; with a festival-like atmosphere where the participants dress
in costumes to seek candy from others.&quot;
     &quot;Ahh, I see now,&quot; Ciscerren purred.  &quot;I&#39;m surprised they still celebrate
that, considering how much the world has changed once the Pantheon&#39;s influence
started to wane after you disappeared, Guardian.  But no matter,&quot; she added
with a regretful shake of her head that set her snakes swaying once again.
     &quot;What, Susan left someone in a lurch without notice?&quot; V spoke up with an
ironic smirk that wasn&#39;t faked in the least.  &quot;Call me crazy.... not that they
don&#39;t already do that.... but somehow I can picture that happening, alright.&quot;
     &quot;Mina....&quot; Susan started to say in a faint tone of warning.
     &quot;My understanding,&quot; Ciscerren said slowly, hissing just slightly as she
spoke, &quot;Was that the Key to Time was destroyed, collapsing the Portal and thus
forcing the entire Pantheon to withdraw their power from the mortal realm in
order to reinforce the Portal to prevent Creation from self-destructing.  With
the Pantheon thus focused elsewhere, the mortal realms began to irrevocably
change.  As for the mysterious fate that befell the Guardian of Time, not even
the Pantheon could say for certain what had truly happened.  None, however, had
any reason to believe it was an act of willful abandonment or that she had cast
aside her obligations and her duties.  Although now that you are indeed here
among us, Guardian....&quot; she added slowly, giving Susan a curious look.
     Susan sighed quietly and ran her free hand through her mane of dark green
hair.  &quot;Suffice it to say that being slain tends to restrict one from fully
discharging their duties,&quot; she murmured, causing the gorgon to blink hard.  &quot;As
you can see, however, I have been restored to a corporeal form and freed from
my soul&#39;s entrapment in The Dark.  The snapped Key was subsequently recovered
from the ruins of the Moon Kingdom and reforged by Lord Hephaestus.  The Portal
was immediately reopened soon afterwards and I was instructed by Lord Hades to
tend to my other duties as a member of the Moon Princess&#39; court.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting....&quot; the gorgon hissed with open fascination.  &quot;If the Moon
Kingdom has fallen as you say, that would explain much that has happened since
that darkest of nights so long ago.  Does your return thus herald a new era for
both our kind and the mortals, then?&quot; she inquired eagerly.
     &quot;That&#39;s one way of looking at it,&quot; V spoke up with a faint giggle, drawing
a truly uneasy look from Susan.  &quot;I, uh.... don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be going back to
the Dark Ages, mind you, but with Serena being an angel now.... well, let&#39;s
just say that the times are likely to be changing and soon.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Ciscerren said, the ridges of her eyebrows arching up.
     &quot;Much has indeed changed,&quot; Susan interjected quickly.  &quot;And I have reason
to believe that more changes will be forthcoming in the years ahead.  However,
we are unable to definitively comment on the nature of those changes as they
are still largely within the realm of speculation and conjecture.  Having said
all that, however, I do not believe it to be likely that our kind will ever be
a part of the mortal plane as we once were.&quot;
     &quot;A pity,&quot; the gorgon sighed, shaking her head gently.  &quot;I did like being
able to pay an unshackled visit the world above when I wished.  The Master is
not without sympathy and allows me the occasional moment of fresh air, but alas
the chains remain around me,&quot; she murmured as she hefted up the edges of her
shroud and held her leg out.
     V glanced down and blinked hard, noticing that the gorgon&#39;s toenails ended
in decidedly sharp-looking points like claws.  The skin of her feet were a very
light shade of green and seemed to be covered in tiny scales, not unlike those
of a reptile.  V was surprised to see that she was barefoot, not seeming to be
bothered in the least by the rough stone surface of the floor.  A slender coil
of silver was wrapped around her right ankle like a bracelet, hardly seeming to
be a burdensome chain that would impede her movement.
     &quot;Wow, that&#39;s pretty,&quot; V found herself saying as she continued to study the
silver anklet.  &quot;Not my style, mind you, as it&#39;d only get in the way with all
the running and jumping I have to do some nights, but maybe a bracelet instead
would go well with those earrings I picked up the other month....&quot;
     &quot;I doubt you would wish to be bound as I am,&quot; Ciscerren murmured quietly
with a soft sigh as she lowered the edge of her shroud.
     &quot;Mina, I will explain later if you wish,&quot; Susan said very quietly to the
blonde, &quot;But you should not comment any further.&quot;
     &quot;Deal,&quot; V whispered back, suddenly realizing that there was more to the
gorgon&#39;s anklet than met the eye.  &quot;So, umm.... not to be nosy or anything,&quot;
she said in a louder tone as she brushed her hair behind her, &quot;But what exactly
are you doing here at this time of night?&quot;
     &quot;Night, is it?&quot; the gorgon replied with open amusement.  &quot;Surely I do not
travel that slowly that the sun has finished rising only to set again since I
turned away from the morning rays and returned here.&quot;
     &quot;Eh?&quot; V said, giving her a slightly confused look.
     &quot;The physical entrance to the cave that connects the Gate of the Arbiter
to the surface is located on a very remote island in the south Atlantic ocean,&quot;
Susan explained.  &quot;Hence it is night in Japan, but not too far removed from
dawn here.&quot;
     &quot;Ah, my bad,&quot; V apologized with a faint blush.  &quot;My head&#39;s still spinning
from all.... this,&quot; she explained with a nervous gesture to her surroundings.
     &quot;Quite understandable, mortal,&quot; Ciscerren replied with a sibilant chuckle.
&quot;Most of your kind do not come here until it is time for Judgment, but if you
are a Guardian like Susan then the rules are somewhat different.&quot;
     &quot;Somewhat,&quot; Susan echoed in a neutral tone.  &quot;I only brought her here for
a quiet conversation, nothing more.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, right,&quot; V muttered beneath her breath, casting a sidelong look at
the green-haired woman.
     &quot;Ahh, I see,&quot; the gorgon purred.  &quot;Then perhaps I should be on my way so
as not to intrude further.  It is good to see you again, Guardian Susan, even
if you cannot return us to the surface.&quot;
     Susan remained silent as Ciscerren made her way over to the closed iron
gates, watching as the other woman picked up a small padded stick to strike
against the bronze gong.  The deep sound that followed seemed to echo forever,
a resonant note that reverberated not just in her ears but in the bound remains
of her darkened soul as well.
     &quot;Oh, dear Christ, what the hell is that?&quot; Sailor V whimpered as the echo
sent a truly primal shiver through her very being.
     &quot;A summons,&quot; Susan explained quietly as the shadow of a boat appeared on
the inky river in the far distance.  &quot;The Ferry of the Damned resides in the
Underworld, across a planar boundary, and so only the most powerful of signals
can be used to garner its attention from the mortal realm.  Death, however,
knows no bounds and so the Knell of the Dead is used as both a call to the
boatsman.... and as a warning to those who still live.&quot;
     &quot;A warning of what?&quot; V inquired in a very wary tone.
     &quot;To beware the approach of the Reaper,&quot; Susan replied quietly as the mists
parted and the small wooden boat came into view.  A shrouded figure stood at
the stern, pushing the boat along with the aid of a large wooden pole.  Even at
a distance its skeletal hands were clearly visible, the bleached white bones
standing out in stark contrast against the black coloring of its shroud and the
river-stained pole.
     &quot;Oh, hell,&quot; V whispered to herself as she looked out across the river.
     &quot;Mina, perhaps we....&quot; Susan started to say.
     &quot;No, no, I&#39;m fine with this,&quot; V interrupted with a curt wave of her hand.
&quot;Really I am.  Morbid curiosity is kicking in and all.  You said I&#39;ll be fine
and all, right?  I&#39;m cool with this, really,&quot; she said rapidly.
     Susan paused to regard the blonde very carefully, not fully certain if she
could accept her words at face-value.  &quot;As you wish,&quot; she finally said as she
pulled her staff out of the temporal flow and gently leaned on it.
     The boat finally reached the pier and drifted to a halt.  There was the
faintest of rasping noises as the boatsman set the pole down inside the boat
and started to walk towards the gate.  It was more of a glide than a walk, as
its stride was perfectly smooth and nobody could see it making physical contact
with the ground.  The gate swung open with a loud and very ominous creak as it
approached, sounding like the iron hinges hadn&#39;t been oiled in centuries.
     The shrouded figure came to a halt in the archway, seeming to loom before
the group like a vengeful wraith.  A ghastly skull was visible inside the cowl,
its empty eye-sockets lit with dull red pinpoints of light like a pair of fiery
coals.  Its gaze seemed to sweep over the three of them in eerie silence, as if
peering into their souls as it studied their faces.
     &quot;Passage is forbidden to living mortals, Guardian Mina,&quot; it finally said
in a truly deep voice as it turned its focus towards Sailor V.  The depth of
the tone was the kind that made bones gently vibrate in the body, making the
blonde tingle all over just from listening.  The skeletal jaw never moved,
however, leaving V to guess how or where the voice was coming from.  &quot;Even to
those who are avatars.  You shall not pass.&quot;
     &quot;Never crossed my mind,&quot; Sailor V managed to reply in a trembling voice.
     &quot;I have summoned you, Boatsman, not her,&quot; Ciscerren spoke up in a firm
tone.  &quot;I seek passage back into the Underworld, to return whence I came.&quot;
     The boatsman turned its burning gaze on her for a moment before making a
simple nod.  &quot;So be it, Gorgon Ciscerren.  Passage is granted,&quot; it said as it
moved to the side.
     &quot;It is a pleasure to have met the both of you,&quot; Ciscerren said to V and
Susan, giving them both a gentle smile.  &quot;Perhaps we will meet again.  In any
case, I look forward to the changes you suggest are coming, Guardian.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps,&quot; Susan replied with a bow of her head.  &quot;I cannot say what those
changes will entail, of course, but in any case you should still be vigilant
for what lies ahead as it may not be as enticing as you currently believe it to
be.  Safe journey to you.&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, what she said,&quot; V added in a still-unsettled voice.  &quot;See ya.&quot;
     They both watched as the gorgon merely smiled at V before raising the hood
of her cowl.  She made sure it was firmly settled in place around the snakes on
her scalp before she stepped past the boatsman and made her way across the pier
and over to the waiting boat.
     &quot;Lord Charon sends his regards, Guardian Susan,&quot; the boatsman said calmly
as it stepped back, just enough to allow the gates to swing shut.  They did so
with a booming echo, seeming to fill the underground cavern with the sound of
finality.  It then turned around and silently returned to the boat without a
backward glance, picking up the pole as it resumed its position at the stern of
the wooden vessel.
     &quot;Just you wait, demon,&quot; V said very quietly to Susan as she watched the
boatsman push the boat away from the pier before slowly moving down-river.  &quot;As
soon as we get out of here and I can use the bathroom in civilized comfort, I
am going to give you such an earful....&quot;
     Susan paused and raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Are you sure you&#39;re alright, Mina?&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; V murmured, the weak sound emerging from her chest like an aborted
cough.  &quot;It&#39;s a little late to be asking now, don&#39;t you think?  I mean, I&#39;ve
already come face-to-face with an agent of Death who knew my name.  Heh,&quot; she
murmured again with another minor spasm of her chest.  &quot;I remember having a
very pissed-off blue-haired vampire in my face awhile back and thinking that I
was looking at the new face of Death at the time.  Boy, was I wrong.  Heh,&quot; she
said, this time seeming to be hiccuping.
     &quot;Mina....&quot; Susan said in a worried tone as she realized that the blonde
wasn&#39;t coughing but was in the initial stages of sobbing.  She blinked hard as
V suddenly turned around to face her, tears already streaming from the corners
of her eyes to run across her cheeks.
     &quot;Susan, why do you hate me?&quot; V asked softly.  &quot;What have I done to you to
deserve being treated like this?&quot;
     The succubus paused and gave her a visibly confused look.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure
I understand what you mean,&quot; she said carefully.  &quot;I certainly don&#39;t hate you,
Mina, quite the contrary.  And if you are referring to me bringing you here to
begin with....&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t mean Mina, demon,&quot; V snarled in a low tone, the sudden surgence
of anger taking Susan by complete surprise.  &quot;I mean *me*.  You call me crazy,
talk as if I don&#39;t have any business existing, you&#39;re trying to take over all
the social contacts that I&#39;ve made over the past two years, you&#39;ve gone out of
your way to destroy my faith in God, you&#39;ve shown me horrors of the night and
taunted me by telling me I don&#39;t know anything about them....  Susan, for the
love of all that is holy,&quot; V cried out as she collapsed to her knees and began
sobbing in earnest, &quot;*WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?*&quot;
     Susan remained silent for several moments, suddenly realizing that it was
entirely possible that she may have just hastened the collapse of Mina&#39;s sanity
by exposing the fragment of Sailor V&#39;s persona to some of the mechanics that
the universe was actually based on.  She had a theory as to the true nature of
the artificial personality, but for now that was a secondary concern.
     &quot;I don&#39;t hate you, Mina,&quot; she finally said as she returned her staff to
the temporal flow and took a single step forward.  She reached out and very
carefully grasped the oversized red glasses on the V&#39;s face, gently slipping
them off.  As she expected, she received a startled look from the blonde before
she was enveloped in a soft nimbus of dull white energy as the transformation
power was drained away.
     &quot;Contrary to what you think,&quot; Susan continued as she briefly studied the
empowered glasses before looking back at a visibly frightened Mina, &quot;Neither do
I hold any ill-will towards your alter-ego.  I have every reason to believe you
are not exaggerating to say that having such a power at your disposal has saved
your life as well as dozens of other lives.  Unfortunately, what I am hesitant
to believe is that you are fully aware of how power and energy are used in this
existence.
     &quot;For every usage of divine power there is a price to be paid by the one
who uses it,&quot; she explained.  &quot;Even for Sailor Scouts.  The cost is small, but
the toll it takes is measurable over time and increases as we age.  What is
easy to do at sixteen is harder at twenty-six and a strain at thirty-six, and
that only takes normal usage of our Sailor Scout powers into account.  In your
case, Mina, you are adding to the burden on your body and spirit by using
another outside power.  And, it seems, to your mind as well.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not insane,&quot; Mina protested softly as the tears continued to flow.
     &quot;No, not yet,&quot; Susan sighed with a gentle shake of her head.  &quot;You have
always been an impulsive and somewhat chaotic individual, even as a child in
the Moon Kingdom.  What I fear, however, is that the toll of dividing not just
your elemental power but your mind as well between Sailor V and Sailor Venus is
slowly exacerbating the natural chaos in your mind.  If left unchecked, it will
eventually become a degenerative spiral that will ultimately lead to madness.&quot;
     &quot;So now what?&quot; Mina sniffed, absently wiping her tears away.  &quot;Are you
going to try to tell me I can&#39;t use her power anymore?  Going to try to keep
her from me?  You already have her in your hands, demon, that&#39;s where she is.
Are you going to destroy her, then?  Kill her?  Murder a heroine who has given
so much for the sake of so many?&quot;
     Susan felt the weight of several centuries of life silently settle around
her shoulders as she listened to the pain and despair in Mina&#39;s words.  &quot;If the
choice was mine,&quot; she began to say, choosing her words with great care, &quot;There
would be no need for Sailor V&#39;s continued existence.  It would be revealed that
Sailor V was actually Sailor Venus in disguise, working undercover in England
in order to draw the focus of others away from Japan at a time when Sailor Moon
was not yet ready to combat evil herself.  A feinting maneuver, if you will.&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Mina murmured, the sound still seeming to be more of a sob or a
cough than an actual laugh.  &quot;People just might believe that, too.&quot;
     &quot;However,&quot; Susan continued as she briefly closed her eyes to take in a
deep breath, &quot;I am aware of my place in the proverbial scheme of things, which
is to say I am an advisor to both Princess Serena and her court.... which would
include you as well.  Advisor, Chancellor, teacher, confidant.... but not a
mother or mistress.  The choice of Sailor V&#39;s existence is not mine to make,
nor will I attempt to make it.  All that I will do is ensure that you are fully
aware of the consequences of continuing to make use of powers that, I suspect,
are not fully your own.&quot;
     Mina blinked hard as Susan reached down to gently press the folded Sailor
V Transformation Glasses into her hands.  She stared down at the red plastic
frames before looking up at the succubus in open confusion.  &quot;Susan....&quot; she
said, clearly not sure what to make of the situation.
     &quot;Calling on Sailor V may help you in dark times, Mina,&quot; Susan said as she
took a step back, absently recalling her staff from the temporal flow again.
&quot;But in doing so, you will be sacrificing part of yourself in the process, one
tiny piece at a time.  Think of it as taking water out of a barrel, one drop at
a time.  Each drop may not seem like much, but over time the water level will
drop until there simply isn&#39;t any more to take.  Sailor Venus&#39; power draws from
the same limited resources as well, so you need to be careful about calling on
such powers.  Were I fully human, I would have lost my powers centuries ago at
the age of forty and likely would have died before I was sixty.  The same fate
awaits all of us in time, Mina, the price to be paid for being a Sailor Scout
and wielding elemental powers that no ordinary mortal could ever hope to have.
Only in your case, calling on Sailor V&#39;s powers will empty the sands in your
personal hourglass all the more rapidly, and once a grain has fallen there is
no going back, no undoing what has been done.  Remember that,&quot; she whispered.
     Mina blinked and looked back down at the glasses in her hand, absently
reaching up to wipe away a stray tear.  &quot;Susan, it&#39;s not that simple,&quot; she said
in a muted tone.  &quot;I would have been dead if it wasn&#39;t for her.  You can ask
Artemis about the tests I&#39;ve done, about how I can prove that there was simply
no way I could have made that jump on my own.  And if I hadn&#39;t been able to
make that jump?  I would have been part of the crater that was left on the
pavement when that denizen attacked.  V can jump six feet further than I can,
and those last seven inches are what separated life from death.&quot;
     Susan said nothing as Mina finally looked up at her, seeing not just the
pain of the memories in the blonde&#39;s blue eyes but a fierce spark of protective
anger as well.  &quot;I owe Sailor V my life,&quot; Mina continued.  &quot;There is absolutely
no doubt about it.  Everything that has happened to me since then, everything
in life I&#39;ve been able to see and experience and enjoy, is extra bonus time on
the clock thanks to her.  Yes, she is nothing without me, without my body to
use and my mind to host hers.... but without her, what would I be?  A name
carved on a tombstone and a broken memory for my parents, that&#39;s it.  Serena
wouldn&#39;t have known me, since I would have been gone long before she knew she
was Sailor Moon, and nobody would have ever even heard of Sailor Venus.&quot;
     &quot;Mina....&quot;
     &quot;So what if she&#39;ll kill me in time?&quot; Mina whispered fiercely as the tears
started to flow again.  &quot;As far as I&#39;m concerned, Susan, I&#39;m already dead.  And
listening to you now, about how we&#39;ll lose our powers in twenty years and have
our candles snuffed out shortly thereafter.... it sounds like we&#39;re already
condemned to an early grave, don&#39;t you think?  So what&#39;s it matter in the end?&quot;
     &quot;It does matter, very much so,&quot; Susan countered in an icy tone.
     &quot;Oh, yeah, the Imperium Silver Crystal thing,&quot; Mina sighed, her anger all
but melting away in the span of a few moments, catching Susan off-guard.  &quot;So
our souls will be protected and eternal, that&#39;s nice.... no, really, it is.  I
can honestly and truthfully handle the idea of a shorter-than-average lifespan
and constant battles against external forces in exchange for a guaranteed spot
in this universe&#39;s idea of Heaven.  But what about V, huh?&quot;
     Susan paused and tilted her head at a slight angle.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand
what you mean,&quot; she said carefully, wondering if this was simply another aspect
of Mina&#39;s weakened sanity that was starting to manifest.
     &quot;I liked the idea of being a Catholic,&quot; the blonde murmured sullenly as
she glanced down at the ground.  &quot;It gave me hope.  And believe me, those first
few weeks when I was coming to terms with Sailor V inside my mind, if I wasn&#39;t
out on the streets hunting green-blooded denizens at night or chatting away the
afternoons with my grandmother, I was inside the chapel trying to find peace.
And until now, I honestly thought I had found the right balance, found the
comfort and solace that I was looking for &#39;knowing&#39; that God was with me and
was watching my back while I put my life on the line.  A very thin line,&quot; she
added with another faint sob of a hollow laugh.  &quot;But of course, you opened my
eyes to the &#39;real world&#39; and changed all that, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
     &quot;Mina, as I said to you earlier, faith is never a waste,&quot; Susan started to
say, only to fall silent as the blonde made an absent gesture of dismissal.
     &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter anymore, Susan,&quot; she sighed as she slowly and almost
painfully rose to her feet.  &quot;Ignorance and innocence are simply two facets of
the same crystal of purity.  Once tainted, once taken, it&#39;s gone forever like
your virginity after that first night with a lover.  Maybe in time I&#39;ll thank
you for showing me the truth,&quot; she added absently as she unfolded the glasses
and slipped them on.
     There was very little Susan could think of to say as she watched Mina&#39;s
body become enveloped in a gentle glow of power, seeming to reshape both her
clothing and her mind in the same instant before fading away to leave behind
the figure of Sailor V.  The blonde paused to stretch for a few brief moments
out of simple habit before she turned to look squarely at the succubus.
     &quot;But enough of that,&quot; she said in a surprisingly calm tone, as if the pain
that had been in Mina&#39;s soul had been erased or otherwise pushed back.  &quot;And
don&#39;t look at me like that, demon, I know what I&#39;m doing.  Okay, so the wick on
the candle is a little shorter than I had thought at first, no big problem.  I
still need to see at night, however, so unless you&#39;re going to cough up a spare
flashlight for the soul, the candle will be lit to provide the light I need.
And when the candle finally burns out.... well, what can I say, it&#39;s been fun
and a royal blast, which is pretty much all we can ask life to be at the end.
Remember, I&#39;ll be dying with her, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m deliberately trying to
run her into the ground like a rusted Chevrolet.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose so,&quot; Susan allowed in a neutral tone, trying very hard not to
sigh quietly in resignation.
     &quot;Bah, quit being such a gloomy Gus,&quot; V grumbled.  She paused and cast a
measured look around the cavern before shivering lightly.  &quot;Although if you
hang out in places like this all the time, I can see why you&#39;d be a bit of a
downer at parties.  Speaking of which, we need to go,&quot; she added, giving Susan
a look that quite clearly conveyed her present mood.  &quot;I&#39;ll make you a simple
deal.... I&#39;ll let you have my little black book, you don&#39;t do anything with it
that I don&#39;t personally okay ahead of time.  And I don&#39;t care if it involves
anything time-sensitive, I want to have it all explained to me up front.  That
sound fair to you?&quot;
     It took Susan a moment to follow along with what the blonde was offering.
&quot;I can assure you that you will not encounter any difficulties with that sort
of arrangement,&quot; she replied with a somber nod.  &quot;After having aided in the
administration of an entire kingdom for six centuries, I am quite confident in
my ability to organize and direct a consortium of business entities and other
talented individuals.&quot;
     &quot;Alrighty, then,&quot; V shrugged.  &quot;Just to warn you, though.... if you screw
me up on this and my butt shows up on some financial detective&#39;s radar, I&#39;ll
put a bounty out on your hide and turn you into the next Richard Kimball.  Uh,
I take it you&#39;ve never watched the TV series &#39;The Fugitive&#39; before?&quot; she added
as she saw the mild look of confusion on Susan&#39;s face at the reference.
     &quot;I can&#39;t say that I have,&quot; Susan allowed, giving V a slightly cool look in
response, &quot;But I believe I can infer your intended meaning from the title.  Not
to sound ungrateful, Mina, but perhaps you would wish to take some time to stop
and truly consider both the pros and the cons of this suggested endeavor?&quot;
     &quot;Oh, don&#39;t be so argumentative,&quot; V moaned quietly as she briefly rubbed
her eyes with her white-gloved fingertips.  &quot;Look, I&#39;ll be honest, I haven&#39;t
done a whole lot with the names I&#39;ve collected and that&#39;s more because I don&#39;t
have the time to sit down and draw up anything more elaborate than what I&#39;ve
already got going as it is.  Sal handles messages, James handles the money,
Abraham is my attorney when I need some advice, all the local TV networks have
someone on the payroll who owes me so I&#39;ve got the media covered, Michael does
his little comic book series starring yours truly, and I&#39;ve got a couple of
boys down on Fourth Street who handle various acquisitions for me.  Everyone
else is just a bonus waiting to happen, if it ever happens at all.  If you can
make something useful and productive happen, I&#39;m all for it.&quot;
     Susan blinked as V suddenly stepped forward and leaned close, almost so
that their noses were pressed together.  &quot;Just one final thing,&quot; V said in a
dangerously soft voice.  &quot;Make sure that no matter how you spin the wheel, all
of our contestants understand that they work for me and not you, and that you
are only doing things on my behalf because I&#39;m busy busting some perp&#39;s behind
for pushing drugs on the street or something.  This is my network, not yours,
and you can bet your bippy I&#39;m keeping full control of it.&quot;
     &quot;If I may, Mina,&quot; Susan replied dryly, &quot;That much was understood in the
beginning.  As I said, I am nobody&#39;s mistress, merely an advisor to those who
have the true power.  And when required,&quot; she added lightly, &quot;The sharp end of
the stick for the hand that wields it.&quot;
     &quot;Mmmhmm,&quot; V hummed to herself as she stepped back.  &quot;Careful how you say
that, I&#39;ve needed to poke a few idjits in the bum with a sharp stick before.
In one case, quite literally.  But anyway, can we go now?  It&#39;s late, or at
least it feels late to me, and I&#39;ve got school in the morning to say nothing
about how loudly my bladder had been screaming in the past half-hour or so.&quot;
     Susan nodded in understanding and held out her staff.  &quot;Where do you wish
to go?&quot; she inquired carefully.
     &quot;Aha, that question again,&quot; V said ruefully as she grasped the offered Key
to Time.  &quot;Lesson learned number one: When your taxi-driver asks you where to,
you don&#39;t let her decide on her own.  How about we aim for the small garden of
lost dreams right behind my apartment building?  I tried to grow a few things
in the dirt awhile back, y&#39;see, but it didn&#39;t quite work out too well.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Susan said as she prepared to open the temporal conduit.
     &quot;Oh, and one more thing, my demonic friend?&quot; Sailor V said carefully.
     &quot;Yes?&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t ever bring any of us to a place like this ever again,&quot; V said in a
somewhat flat tone.  &quot;Yes, it seems to be important to the here-after, but we
can skip the peek behind the curtains.  To quote Albert Einstien to you once
more, imagination is more important than knowledge.  I imagined the doorway to
the afterlife to be all bright and cheerful, something to give the new arrival
a warm and fuzzy feeling.  Try not to spoil anyone else&#39;s dreams unless you
really really have to, alright?&quot;
     Susan looked at the expression on her face and nodded in understanding.
&quot;I shall endeavor to avoid doing so in the future,&quot; she promised before they
were both drawn into the temporal flow in a flash of light.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Glitter,&quot; Octane said in a perfectly flat tone as the transport came to
a somewhat abrupt halt, causing both Tolaris and K&#39;tal to almost literally
bounce off of the restraint harnesses and fall back into the seats.
     &lt;Hey, that wasn&#39;t my fault,&gt; the drone pilot protested.  &lt;I think we just
lost one of the fuel injectors in the drive train and the throttle dropped into
a lower gear.  Running the diagnostics now.&gt;
     &quot;Sounds bad,&quot; K&#39;tal commented with a slight wince as he unbuckled the web
restraints.  &quot;Don&#39;t suppose you could open the door for us?  Thanks,&quot; he added
as the hatch promptly hissed open.
     &lt;Wuss,&gt; Glitter muttered.
     &quot;Hey, it&#39;s not my fault it&#39;s been years since I&#39;ve been a passenger in a
cramped ground transport like this,&quot; K&#39;tal countered as he gingerly eased his
now-sore backside out of the bucket seat and half-stumbled out into the open
air.  &quot;Ahh, there we..... errrk,&quot; he gagged as he caught a solid whiff of an
odor that immediately seared his nasal passages.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, what in the
name of the NegaForce is that smell?&quot;
     &quot;Probably cruiser exhaust,&quot; Octane commented as she climbed out of her own
seat and exited the transport.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; she added sourly as she cast a glance
towards the bug-shaped personal cruiser sitting on one of the smaller landing
pads a few dozen yards away.  &quot;Someone needs a filter changed, alright.&quot;
     &quot;Eeesh,&quot; K&#39;tal protested as he waved a hand in front of his face.  He cast
a quick glance behind him and paused in mid-wave, suddenly realizing that the
tow cable hookup was empty.  &quot;Wait, where&#39;s T&#39;Del?&quot;
     &lt;She disconnected when we hit the outer perimeter,&gt; Glitter called out.
&lt;Probably just glided on over to the back entrance or something.  She has a
distress beacon wired into her suit in case something goes wrong, by the way,
so I know the disconnect was intentional.&gt;
     &quot;Thank you for the ride,&quot; Tolaris said quietly as he passed Glitter on his
way out of the transport.  He hopped down to the ground and promptly made a
face as the stench of over-oxidized fuel reached his nose.  He cast a quick
glance around him to see where things were before turning his focus inward to
create a gentle breeze that attempted to clear the air of the fumes.
     &lt;Yeah, you&#39;re welcome,&gt; the drone pilot grumbled.  &lt;Hey, chief?  I&#39;m going
to go find an empty maintenance bay and unclog that fuel injector so we don&#39;t
have to worry about throttle issues when everyone sobers up.  Try to save me a
bottle of something, will you?&gt;
     &quot;No problem,&quot; Octane replied as she reached past Tolaris with a pair of
tentacles to slam the hatch shut.  &quot;Come on, boys, it&#39;s not a healthy idea to
spend too much time out in the open here.  That way,&quot; she added with a gesture
of a third tentacle.
     &quot;Copy, chief,&quot; K&#39;tal said.  He flinched slightly as the transport seemed
to suddenly explode into motion behind him, kicking up a moderate spray of grit
and dirt as it darted further down the street.  &quot;You know, maybe I need to cut
Asrial&#39;s driving a little more slack after all,&quot; he commented as he started to
follow the tentacled mechanic towards the indicated building.
     &quot;Maybe,&quot; Tolaris echoed in a neutral tone, still absently focused on the
mild breeze he was stirring up around them.  The trip was a fairly short one
before they found themselves standing outside of a somewhat battered pub, the
exterior walls looking like they hadn&#39;t been cleaned in years.  A very large
sign was pasted to the left of the door, and beneath it was a chipped porcelin
toilet that had obviously seen better days.
     &quot;S&#39;pani P&#39;tai,&quot; K&#39;tal commented as he glanced up at the neon sign that was
hung over the metal doorframe.  &quot;The Biased Bastard.  Of all the things to name
a bar, why that?&quot;
     A soft snort of amusement rose up from Octane&#39;s chest.  &quot;The bar-mistress
told us she named it after her father,&quot; she replied, prompting hard blinks from
both Dragoons.  They exchanged faintly uneasy looks before K&#39;tal simply shook
his head in amazement.
     &quot;Charming,&quot; he muttered.
     &quot;It gets better,&quot; Tolaris pointed out as he made a gesture towards the
sign on the left.  &quot;Call it a hunch, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re kidding about
the house rules.  Read.&quot;
     K&#39;tal paused briefly before looking over at the sign.  &quot;House Rules,&quot; he
read aloud.  &quot;Leave the rank in the top tank, no exceptions whatsoever, and do
not try to enforce any military decorum.  I hear anyone say sir, ma&#39;am, or use
a military form of address in my bar, and someone&#39;s head will wind up at the
bottom of the tank.  Sincerely, B&#39;nai.  That&#39;s.... a touch harsh,&quot; he added.
     &quot;And no, she&#39;s not kidding,&quot; Octane spoke up as she reached into the front
of her overalls to pull out a small stub of a cigar.  &quot;Check the toilet tanks
if you want proof.&quot;
     K&#39;tal and Tolaris exchanged wary looks while Octane lit her cigar.  K&#39;tal
glanced over his shoulder at the toilet for a number of moments before taking
a deep breath and walking over to it, peering into the open top tank.  &quot;Wow,&quot;
he said as he saw it was half-filled with various military rank insignia in
various conditions of decay.  &quot;I know sergeants like to party and all, but you
could probably outfit a division with all this.  Hey, is that a general&#39;s star
in the corner?&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai is no fan of the military,&quot; the mechanic explained after taking a
deep puff of her cigar.  &quot;She won&#39;t lunge across the bar to eviscerate you with
a spoon if you walk in wearing a uniform, but she&#39;ll tear the rank insignia off
your collar in an instant.  The safest route is to wear civvies or non-descript
utility clothes and treat everyone around you like familiar friends.  You&#39;ll
get used to it.  Careful with that,&quot; she added in a tone of warning as K&#39;tal
started to lift up the lid to the basin.
     The attempt at looking inside lasted for all of half a second as K&#39;tal saw
what he half-expected to find, resulting in the lid promptly slamming down and
him taking a quick hop back.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; the Dragoon breathed, giving
Tolaris a stunned look.
     &quot;When in the Outreaches....&quot; Tolaris said casually with a shrug.
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; K&#39;tal agreed, giving Octane an uneasy look.
     &quot;Settle down,&quot; Octane sighed, rolling her eyes before flicking a bit of
ash into the dirt beside the door.  She then jammed the cigar in her mouth and
reached out, pushing open the door of the bar to let the sounds and smells of
a typically rowdy drinking establishment fill the air.
     The Dragoons traded leery looks before following her inside, pausing just
inside the doorway to look around the bar.  It was pretty much what they had
expected it to be, a somewhat run-down place with dozens of small tables taking
up the center area and a number of booths lining the walls.  The entire left
side of the building was taken up by the bar where a lone bartender was idly
mixing up a series of drinks.  The far end of the bar contained a small stage
where a jukebox sat off to one side and a pair of brass poles ran from the
ceiling to the wooden stage floor.
     &quot;I guess it&#39;s too late to change my mind, huh?&quot; K&#39;tal muttered to Tolaris
as he continued to look around.  A small hallway off to his immediate left led
to a series of stairs, suggesting that there was a second floor to the place.
The bar was already half-filled with patrons, all wearing some form of gruff or
work-oriented clothing that suggested most were manual laborers of one kind or
another.
     &quot;Settle down,&quot; Tolaris murmured back.  He paused as Octane let out a loud
yell as she made a gesture with her cigar, elicting a number of causal roars
and bellows from the other patrons.  The woman behind the bar cast a glance at
the tentacled mechanic and nodded her head in greeting before turning her focus
to the pair of Dragoons standing just inside the entranceway.  She seemed to
narrow her eyes for several seconds as she gave them a truly piercing look of
suspicion before she set down the drink she was mixing and made a curt gesture
for them to approach.
     &quot;Okay, I didn&#39;t do it,&quot; K&#39;tal said quietly as they both started to thread
their way among various patrons to approach the bar-mistress.  &quot;Fair evening,&quot;
he said once they got close enough to talk without having to yell.
     &quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; the bar-mistress growled, prompting K&#39;tal to blink in
surprise and Tolaris to raise a wary eyebrow.  &quot;Let&#39;s keep this short.... I&#39;ve
never seen either of you in here before, and pudgy here looks like he spends
his days behind a desk,&quot; she said, jerking her chin towards Tolaris&#39; waistline.
&quot;That makes you outsiders, which means you two had better tread very carefully
in here.  Understand?&quot;
     &quot;We know the rules,&quot; Tolaris spoke up calmly.
     &quot;Good, it means you can read,&quot; the woman pointed out flatly.  &quot;Which means
I can spare you the rest of the lecture.&quot;
     &quot;How kind of you,&quot; K&#39;tal replied in a level tone.  &quot;You wouldn&#39;t by any
chance happen to be B&#39;nai, would you?&quot;
     &quot;What&#39;s your first clue?&quot; the bar-mistress shot back with a sneer.
     &quot;K&#39;tal,&quot; Tolaris said quietly, trying not to sigh in resignation.
     &quot;Just curious, that&#39;s all,&quot; K&#39;tal said casually as he started to step back
from the bar and look around.  He blinked hard as B&#39;nai promptly reached out to
grab him by the collar of his shirt, yanking him back down until he was almost
face-to-face with her.
     &quot;K&#39;tal, is it?&quot; she said in a very low tone.
     &quot;That&#39;s what my mother came up with, yes,&quot; the Dragoon replied calmly.
&quot;Is there something I can help you with, by chance, or are you merely trying
to straighten out a kink in my neck?  That&#39;s a lovely necklace you&#39;re wearing,
by the way,&quot; he added as he briefly studied the silvery pendant hanging from a
chain around her neck.
     B&#39;nai stared at him for a moment before casting a sidelong glance over at
the other figure standing in front of her.  &quot;And you would be.... Tolaris, I
take it?&quot; she inquired, still using a low tone that was not easily overheard.
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Tolaris replied after a minor hesitation, suddenly getting the
very distinct feeling he was about to have his k&#39;vesan caught in a trap of one
form or another.
     &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; B&#39;ani said as she glanced back at K&#39;tal before letting go of his
shirt.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you two should go have a seat in the corner over there,&quot; she
suggested with a gesture of her chin to a somewhat dark and dismal booth set
into the corner.  &quot;I&#39;ll bring your drinks once they&#39;re ready.&quot;
     &quot;Right....&quot; K&#39;tal said slowly, likewise fighting off a feeling of dread
about the way the situation had changed.  &quot;And we&#39;re doing that because...?&quot;
     B&#39;nai merely raised a dark gray eyebrow.  &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid, okay?&quot; she
growled quietly.  &quot;Just sit your ptankas in the booth and try to stay out of
trouble.  Now get off my bar and let me get back to work.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Tolaris spoke up with a faint nod of his head as he started
to turn away.  He paused in mid-motion for a brief instant before he glanced
back at the young lady.  &quot;S&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue, if you have it.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t insult me,&quot; the bar-mistress snarled.  Tolaris merely smirked at
her before he turned back and made his away across the floor, carefully edging
around various patrons who were all but ignoring him.
     K&#39;tal cast a quick glance over his shoulder to make sure Tolaris was on
his way over to the indicated corner booth before he turned his attention back
to the bar-mistress.  &quot;Mind if I have another moment of your time, ne&#39;ana?&quot; he
asked in a very quiet tone that was almost lost against the background din.
     &quot;Do I look like I&#39;m for rent?&quot; B&#39;nai shot back, likewise speaking quietly.
     &quot;You look like you&#39;d make a hell of a date, not to mention scorch a hole
in the bedsheets later, but that&#39;s not what I&#39;m asking,&quot; K&#39;tal said calmly, his
words first resulting in a surprised blink before her expression changed to one
of guarded suspicion.  &quot;One denizen to another.... who set this trap for us?&quot;
     &quot;Yeah, you&#39;re a Dragoon alright,&quot; B&#39;nai smirked, drawing the faintest hint
of a wry smile from K&#39;tal.  &quot;Just have a seat, he should be here soon enough.
Oh, and he already told me to put everything on his tab, so if you want to load
up on the expensive stuff to really stick it to him, feel free.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll keep that in mind,&quot; K&#39;tal replied dryly as he studied her face very
carefully.  She seemed to be young but not too young, probably in her mid- or
late-400s.  Her hair was a natural shade of dark gray with piercing eyes to
match, like stormclouds trapped in a pair of orbs.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be
kind enough to name our generous benefactor for this little outing?&quot;
     She snorted quietly in disdain as she picked up a clean glass and began to
fill it with ice.  &quot;You&#39;ll find out,&quot; she said.  &quot;He said he owes you one, so
he wanted to make it a surprise.  I can tell you this much, however.... I can
guarantee you he will NOT be trying to start something in my bar,&quot; she added
with a look of fiery conviction in her eyes.  &quot;So don&#39;t worry, you won&#39;t be
going home with a knife in your liver or something.  Maybe with your head in a
used toilet, perhaps....&quot;
     &quot;I suppose that&#39;s fair,&quot; K&#39;tal mused.  &quot;Thank you.  Oh, umm.... one last
thing.  What exactly did he order?&quot; he inquired with a very discreet jerk of
his thumb towards the corner booth were Tolaris was sitting.
     &quot;Something you could probably use,&quot; she sneered as she reached out to grab
the front of his shirt again.  She pulled his collar back for a moment before
letting go and leaning slightly towards him.  &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ll mix one up for you
as well.  It&#39;ll put some hair on that baby-smooth chest of yours.&quot;
     K&#39;tal raised an eyebrow at her, giving her a level look for a number of
moments before letting his gaze fall down to the fastenings of her blouse.  &quot;If
it really does that, then you&#39;ve just ruined a good mental picture for me,&quot; he
said casually.
     &quot;Go sit down before I kill you with my bare hands,&quot; B&#39;nai suggested in a
distinctly arctic tone as she resumed mixing a vibrant pink drink.
     &quot;You can bare it later to prove me wrong, if you wish,&quot; K&#39;tal purred back
at her as he edged back.  &quot;You will find I don&#39;t have any problems offering a
properly humble apology in private.  I have a reputation to maintain in public,
however, so you know how it goes.  Fair evening.&quot;
     &quot;Keep wishing,&quot; B&#39;nai growled in a truly dangerous tone, giving him a look
that would have turned his chest into a smoking crater if her eyes had been a
lethal weapon.
     K&#39;tal merely smiled at her and bowed his head lightly before turning away
from the bar and gingerly making his way over to the corner.  &quot;Seems to be a
decent crowd for early in the week,&quot; he said to Tolaris once he got within
casual conversation range.
     &quot;Work hard, play hard,&quot; Tolaris commented as he scooted over slightly to
make more room.  The booth was shaped in a three-quarters circle and was more
than a little close to the table, providing just enough space for four or five
individuals to sit in relative comfort.  &quot;So what&#39;d you find out?&quot;
     &quot;Nothing useful,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he sat down.  &quot;Except that the drinks
are on someone else&#39;s tab tonight.  I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this one.&quot;
     Tolaris merely grunted very quietly to himself.  &quot;You and me both.&quot;
     &quot;On the bright side,&quot; K&#39;tal continued as he began to very casually look
around the bar, &quot;I&#39;ve been given assurances that our mysterious guest won&#39;t be
trying to start anything.  Or at least not inside *her* bar,&quot; he added with a
faint emphasis on the word and a dry chuckle.  &quot;She&#39;s definitely a feisty one,
I&#39;ll tell you that much.&quot;
     The elder Dragoon shot him a somewhat bemused look.  &quot;If I had known you
were going to try to get information from a woman using casual flirting, I&#39;d
have brought along Lieutenant Maze.&quot;
     &quot;He might have actually gotten somewhere with her, too,&quot; K&#39;tal replied
lightly.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t make a serious pass at her without pissing off Ael, so
who knows what might have really happened.  But to be honest, T&#39;Del said it was
intended to be just you and I on this little outing and nobody else, so Maze
probably wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to join us for that lovely cross-desert
cruise.  No disrespect to our hosts, of course, but Glitter&#39;s driving makes
Asrial&#39;s driving seem.... tame.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s the neural interface,&quot; Tolaris explained, glancing up towards the
bar as a young woman with unusually vibrant amber hair entered the pub.  She
seemed to look around the bar for a number of moments before being approached
by a visibly wary B&#39;nai.  &quot;The response time is greatly reduced when you&#39;re
thinking instead of physically reacting,&quot; he continued, &quot;So you get results in
real-time like tighter curves and sharper shifts in momentum instead of having
that extra half-second delay.&quot;
     &quot;Still,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed, absently watching as B&#39;nai examined a metallic card
the other woman produced before muttering something obviously distasteful and
passing over what looked to be an electronic key-card.  The woman nodded her
head in understanding and headed for the small staircase, quickly disappearing
from view a few moments later.  &quot;I see the specialized entertainment industry
is alive and well,&quot; he commented.  &quot;Any bets on the pricing?&quot;
     &quot;Too much for not enough,&quot; Tolaris replied calmly, prompting a cough from
K&#39;tal as he struggled to contain a burst of laughter.
     &quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; he finally said in a calm tone once his stomach
quit heaving from repressed mirth.  &quot;Granted you can&#39;t beat Hospitality on the
notion of &#39;price&#39;, but sometimes you really do get what you pay for.  Or so I
have been told,&quot; he added quickly as he received a somewhat nonplussed look in
response.  &quot;Don&#39;t look at me like that, you know I&#39;m not the kind of denizen.&quot;
     &quot;So is Ael&#39;ien going to be keeping you out of trouble now?&quot; Tolaris asked
out of idle curiosity as he went back to keeping a watchful eye on the local
population.  Octane was pretty hard to miss given the large tentacles sprouting
from her half-exposed bare back, and she was casually chatting away with what
looked to be a beer in hand with a crowd of men and women who all looked like
they were mechanics themselves.
     &quot;Eh, who knows,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he rested one elbow on the table and put
his chin in his hand.  &quot;One night together doesn&#39;t make us life-mates, even if
we are psi-linked, but I can&#39;t say that I&#39;m adverse to the thought of having a
long-term relationship with her.  But at least she&#39;s my age, give or take a few
decades.  Hey, easy on the icy look there....&quot; he added as the air temperature
around him suddenly dropped by a measurable degree as Tolaris cast a truly dark
look towards him.
     &quot;Not to be taking a page from Sailor Jupiter&#39;s handbook or anything, but
I take it you have something you&#39;d like to say on the issue of my relationship
with Sailor Mercury?&quot; Tolaris spoke up in a calm but distinctly frosty tone.
     &quot;Yeah,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a soft snort.  &quot;Feel free to pull the weed out
of your ptanka, I wasn&#39;t even thinking about your own personal business in the
slightest.  Although now that you&#39;re asking, she *does* seem to be a bit on the
young side, but what do I know about how humans mature?&quot;
     Tolaris grunted quietly and looked away, realizing that he had overreacted
to the other denizen&#39;s comments.  &quot;Sorry,&quot; he murmured.  &quot;And to be perfectly
honest, I don&#39;t quite understand them myself.... but I do know an adult mind
when I encounter one.  Besides, they only live a century at the absolute most,
so they have to grow up fairly quickly.  Or at least by our standards.  Granted
there are exceptions, of course, but by and large they seem to have things all
sorted out by the time they reach their twenties.&quot;
     &quot;Amazing,&quot; K&#39;tal observed as he shook his head gently.  &quot;When I was that
age, I was still playing with building blocks and drinking out of plastic cups
with spill-proof lids.  How old are they now?&quot;
     Tolaris paused to think for a moment.  &quot;Most of them are sixteen, and I
believe both Uranus and Neptune are seventeen.  Prince Darian is in his early
twenties.... I believe he said twenty-two, but I&#39;d have to ask him again.  But
as for Sailor Pluto.... she said she was in my age category, but that she&#39;s not
fully human.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; K&#39;tal said as he sat up straight.  &quot;You mean she&#39;s a hybrid like our
enigmatic Moon Princess?&quot;
     &quot;Somewhat,&quot; Tolaris replied.  &quot;She is half-human, of course, but I&#39;m not
sure what the other half is.  I believe she said &#39;demon&#39; and that her specific
heritage was a succubus.  I&#39;ve been meaning to research the details of that if
possible, seeing how it&#39;s my understanding that humans believe demons to be
mere myths, but I haven&#39;t had much idle time lately.  Cross-dimensional rescue
missions tend to get in the way of peaceful research like that,&quot; he added with
a wry smile.
     &quot;Don&#39;t you just hate it when that happens?&quot; K&#39;tal smirked as he glanced up
at the bar as a new arrival made his way inside.  It took him a moment to focus
properly before an icy chill slammed into his guts like a lead weight.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha
navidshi....&quot; he whispered in a tone of muted dread.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Tolaris said as he looked up and likewise felt a truly deep chill
seep into his veins.  He could only watch in silence as B&#39;nai cast a dark look
at the new arrival before making a curt gesture to the corner booth and turning
her back in an unmistakable gesture.  The lone figure continued to look at her
for a number of moments before shaking his head and making his way over to the
darkened booth.
     &quot;I see you&#39;re alive and well, Tolaris,&quot; Colonel Azi&#39;mar said calmly as he
casually sat down at the other end of the circular booth.  &quot;I suppose that is
for the better, all things considered.&quot;
     &quot;Colonel,&quot; Tolaris replied in a neutral tone.
     &quot;Be careful,&quot; Azi&#39;mar spoke up, giving Tolaris a one-eyed look of mild
caution.  &quot;B&#39;nai has radar ears and won&#39;t think twice about coming over here
to rip you a new one if she hears you mentioning rank.  You both may dispense
with the usual protocol as we are all out-of-uniform and off duty.  So how was
the desert express?&quot;
     &quot;Jarring,&quot; K&#39;tal said, his tone likewise as flat and empty of emotion as
Tolaris&#39; had been.  &quot;But then again, letting a certain Felinoid Lieutenant sit
behind the controls of a cruiser on occasion is no different, so I can&#39;t say
that I&#39;m not used to it.  Tell me that&#39;s not your leaky cruiser sitting on the
pad outside stinking things up.&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;tal,&quot; Tolaris said very quietly in a firm tone.
     &quot;Hardly,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied with a soft snort of contempt.  &quot;I know which
cruiser you&#39;re talking about, however, and if you care to check the registry
numbers on the aft section you&#39;ll see that it&#39;s a cargo-hauler from a remote
depot in the Central Plains.&quot;
     &quot;When in doubt, blame the Central Plains,&quot; K&#39;tal said with an idle shrug.
     &quot;So I take it you had T&#39;Del set us up?&quot; Tolaris asked in a dangerously
flat tone, giving the one-eyed colonel a truly piercing look.
     Azi&#39;mar closed his eye and leaned back against the padded backing of the
booth.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I heard you were in town, and with the situation
being what it was I felt that it might be best if we were to have a little talk
in a private setting before everything winds up going to hell.  It was merely
convenient for everyone involved to have T&#39;Del ask you to come over here with
her since she was scheduled to perform tonight anyway.  I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;re
familiar with her performance skills, Tolaris?&quot; he inquired as he opened his
eye and gave the elder Dragoon a somewhat lazy and languid look of intrigue.
     The look that he got back was far colder than the one Tolaris had given
K&#39;tal a few minutes earlier.  &quot;With all due respect, Azi&#39;mar,&quot; he said, making
sure to keep his tone free of any disrespectful overtones while still keeping
the chilling undertone, &quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s any of your business.  But then
again, I&#39;m sure you already know the extent of my relationship with her.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar merely shook his head as he leaned forward to twist his head and
peer up towards the bar.  &quot;Digging up arcane dirt on people and following the
threads of obscure history here and there is your fieldcraft, not mine.  What
I know consists of what information she has volunteered in the past, which is
to say precious little.  Not that it matters, of course.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose I should take comfort in that,&quot; Tolaris allowed, still keeping
his focus on Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;Not to be rude, but unless you intend to shut the trap
on us some time next week, can we go ahead and get this one over with?&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar paused and raised a salt-and-pepper eyebrow.  &quot;Patience, Tolaris,
not everyone is here yet.  B&#39;nai should be here soon with something to drink,
just as soon as she is finished playing her little games.&quot;
     &quot;I take it she knows you&#39;re military, eh?&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up carefully.
     &quot;Trust me, she knows,&quot; Azi&#39;mar assured him with a smirk.  &quot;While we have
a few idle moments, Tolaris, how is the Moon Princess doing?&quot;
     &quot;Evacuated to Earth, last I checked,&quot; Tolaris replied cautiously.  &quot;Not
that I&#39;ve spoken with her myself lately or anything.&quot;
     &quot;She&#39;s fine,&quot; K&#39;tal added.  &quot;Sailor Mercury was kind enough to give us an
update yesterday after the dust had settled.&quot;
     A faint grunt rose up from Azi&#39;mar&#39;s chest as his expression slipped into
a somewhat contemplative mien.  &quot;That&#39;s oddly comforting to hear, actually,&quot; he
confessed in a quiet tone.  &quot;Sailor V made mention of her ill health and how
badly the other Sailor Scouts would react if anything harmful happened to her.
Needless to say, I had every reason to believe she was being serious.&quot;
     &quot;I heard how your meeting went in Mar&#39;ken,&quot; Tolaris commented.
     &quot;And?&quot; Azi&#39;mar prompted after the Dragoon fell silent.
     Tolaris simply shrugged in reply.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that both Sailor V and
myself are quietly grateful for your rare display of non-interference.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m sure you are,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied dryly with a dark smirk.
     &quot;Hel-lo, what do we have here?&quot; K&#39;tal whistled very softly as he leaned to
one side to get a better look at the figure who just walked into the bar.  &quot;Oh,
you have *got* to be kidding me.  Tolaris, tell me that isn&#39;t who I think it is
over there by the bar.&quot;
     &quot;Let me guess, the other shoe is about to drop?&quot; Tolaris inquired as he
cast a wary look at Azi&#39;mar before looking over towards the bar.  He promptly
blinked hard as the new arrival started to head over in their direction, her
shimmering evening gown seeming to be extremely out-of-place when compared to
the slightly grungy clothing of the rest of the patrons.  Four-fifths of the
bar was turning to watch her as well, her heels making a muted clicking sound
on the wooden flooring as she walked.
     &quot;Scoot over,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said absently as he shifted sideways on the seat to
make room for the new arrival.
     Admiral Si&#39;ren came to a sudden halt once she reached the table and was
able to see who was occupying it.  She cast a very uneasy look at both Tolaris
and K&#39;tal before turning her focus towards Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;Well,&quot; she finally said
in a somewhat normal tone of conversation, &quot;I suppose I should have expected an
ambush of some kind.  Gentlemen,&quot; she added as she glanced back over at the
Dragoons.
     &quot;Fair evening,&quot; Tolaris said, seeming to be fighting the urge to sigh.
     &quot;Lady Si&#39;ren,&quot; K&#39;tal added with a slight bow of his head.  &quot;If you don&#39;t
mind my saying so, that is an absolutely stunning dress.  I wasn&#39;t aware that
the Navy had such decent tastes.&quot;
     &quot;Settle down, K&#39;tal,&quot; Azi&#39;mar grumbled quietly, giving him a somewhat dark
look.  &quot;So glad you could join us, Si&#39;ren.  Please, have a seat.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren gave him a leery look before sitting down in the recently vacated
spot and absently tucking the edges of her dress in.  &quot;When you said I should
wear something like this, I was honestly expecting a place of.... shall we say,
slightly higher caliber,&quot; she observed as she briefly surveyed the room.
     &quot;Our mutual associate seems to be in a mood for laying traps for everyone
tonight,&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up in a faintly rueful tone.  &quot;Due respect, we had no
idea either of you would be here.&quot;
     &quot;Oh, really now....&quot; Si&#39;ren said, turning to give Azi&#39;mar a look.  &quot;Odd,
I wasn&#39;t expecting company either.  So, Azi&#39;mar, I don&#39;t suppose you can shed
a little light on why I was rather rudely &#39;asked&#39; to fly across a large portion
of the planet to this.... charming establishment?&quot; she said, casting an openly
suspicious look towards the empty performance stage.
     &quot;One thing at a time,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said as he leaned forward to wave his arm
in the air towards the bar.  He continued to do so until B&#39;nai looked up as she
caught the motion in her peripheral vision, a somewhat dark scowl crossing her
face as she saw who was gesturing for her attention.  She finally nodded to him
and returned to her work, quickly setting up a number of glasses on the bar.
     &quot;Some of us don&#39;t have all night to wait,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out archly.  &quot;I
don&#39;t know about your schedule, but mine is pretty full now.&quot;
     &quot;Time is what you make of it, Si&#39;ren,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied calmly.  &quot;And you
will simply have to trust me for the moment when I say that this little meeting
is going to be worth your time and then some.  However, I believe that it will
go far more smoothly once everyone has had something to drink first.  Si&#39;ren,&quot;
he added softly as a truly dark look crossed her face, &quot;I am not trying to play
games or waste your time, but rather I am trying to gather the courage to speak
of this as best I can.  Indulge me.&quot;
     The confession caused everyone else to blink virtually in unison, keenly
aware of his historical reputation for staunch courage and valor on the field
of battle before leaving the Special Operations division.  They traded uneasy
looks with one another before seeming to lean back slightly.  &quot;Very well, if
you insist,&quot; Si&#39;ren said in a fairly neutral tone.
     &quot;Hello....&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up in a somewhat purring tone as B&#39;nai approached
the table with a small serving tray loaded with drinks.
     &quot;Settle down,&quot; B&#39;nai growled back as she casually flicked a series of
small square coasters across the table with practiced ease.  &quot;S&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue
for the two of you,&quot; she said as she set a pair of neon-blue drinks down on the
coasters in front of Tolaris and K&#39;tal.
     &quot;Thank you, ne&#39;ana,&quot; K&#39;tal murmured.  &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;seren Six,&quot; the bar-mistress replied as a rather crystalline green
cocktail was set in front of Si&#39;ren, prompting a surprised look from the white-
haired admiral.  B&#39;nai then cast a visibly hostile look towards Azi&#39;mar before
grunting softly and plopping down an empty glass and a fairly squat bottle in
front of him.  &quot;Last bottle, by the way,&quot; she pointed out in an edged tone.
     &quot;I suppose that means you want to increase the price?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired
mildly as he started to peel off the wax seal on the bottle.
     B&#39;nai snorted to herself.  &quot;As if more could be bought.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not worried about the price, B&#39;nai,&quot; Azi&#39;mar pointed out.  &quot;Nor am I
concerned about its rarity.  It was made to be savored, not to be collected.&quot;
     &quot;Ow,&quot; K&#39;tal coughed as he took an experimental sip of the blue drink, his
eyes widening as his throat started to burn the instant he swallowed.  &quot;What
did you put in this, rocket fuel?&quot;
     &quot;Can&#39;t hold your liquor, Dragoon?&quot; B&#39;nai sneered.
     &quot;B&#39;nai,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said quietly, drawing a dark look from her.  &quot;It&#39;s quite
likely that we&#39;ll never see one another again after tonight.  Have the good
grace to behave for once in your life, if only for my sake.&quot;
     Tolaris paused in mid-sip and traded startled looks with Si&#39;ren, who was
likewise briefly caught in frozen motion.  He simply shrugged his shoulder in
a very subtle gesture and took a cautious sip of the mixed drink, arching his
eyebrows as he tasted a far higher alcohol content that he remembered from the
last time he had ordered the drink in a tavern in the Southern Flatlands.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; B&#39;nai spoke up, one gray eyebrow arching up in open suspicion.  &quot;So
you&#39;re finally leaving here, I trust?  By all means, don&#39;t let me stop you.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar paused and briefly closed his good eye before twisting the cap off
of the bottle.  The discarded cap was tossed on the table with a muted clatter
and the bottle promptly up-ended, causing four sets of eyebrows to rise up in
perfect unison at his open disregard for manners.
     &quot;Pah,&quot; he sighed after swallowing and setting the bottle back down.  &quot;We
can discuss this in private later, if you want, but the short version is I&#39;ll
probably be executed in the morning.&quot;
     &quot;What?&quot; both K&#39;tal and Si&#39;ren said in perfect unison.
     B&#39;nai simply stood still, staring at Azi&#39;mar in uneasy silence for several
moments.  &quot;Executed, huh?&quot; she finally said.  &quot;So now what did you do?&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re now concerned about me after all this time,&quot; Azi&#39;mar
countered as he sat back in the booth and gave her a somewhat piercing look.
     &quot;Spare me the games,&quot; B&#39;nai growled softly, setting the serving tray down
on the table with a muted thump that rattled the remaining glasses on it.
     K&#39;tal carefully cleared his throat.  &quot;Can I ask you two a question?&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps proper introductions are in order after all,&quot; Azi&#39;mar sighed as
he reached for the bottle, ignoring K&#39;tal&#39;s question for the moment.  &quot;You&#39;re
already familiar with Commander K&#39;tal and Commander Tolaris of the Dragoon
Legion, I presume?&quot;
     &quot;Only in a very remote sense,&quot; B&#39;nai said, giving K&#39;tal a truly glacial
look before casting a far less frosty glance over towards Tolaris.
     &quot;I take it K&#39;tal hit on you?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired in a faintly amused tone
before taking another deep drink directly from the bottle.
     &quot;Wishful thinking, I assure you,&quot; K&#39;tal said with a small smirk.
     &quot;Wishful indeed,&quot; B&#39;nai growled darkly.
     &quot;Pah,&quot; Azi&#39;mar sighed again as the bottle was set down.  &quot;K&#39;tal doesn&#39;t
bite, I assure you, but no matter.  In any case, this is Fleet Admiral Si&#39;ren,
currently the most powerful woman on the planet in terms of authority,&quot; he
added with a casual gesture to his side.  &quot;I&#39;m sure you have no intention of
having any respect for that, but you can at least be kind to her tonight as
she&#39;s liable to be the one holding the sword for the execution.&quot;
     &quot;Really, now....&quot; B&#39;nai said carefully, giving Si&#39;ren a sidelong look for
a number of moments before returning her focus to Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;And here I was
thinking you simply found yourself another....&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai,&quot; Azi&#39;mar interrupted in a truly chilling tone, casting a piercing
glare at her.  He stared at her in heavy silence before he let his breath out
in a soft exodus.  &quot;We&#39;ve already discussed that, but you&#39;ve never bothered to
listen to me before so I&#39;ll not waste my breath trying to explain it again.
No matter.  Everyone, I should like you to meet my daughter, B&#39;nai.&quot;
     Tolaris just sighed and reached out to thump K&#39;tal on the back as the
younger Dragoon immediately choked on his drink.  &quot;Settle down,&quot; he murmured
quietly, casting a brief glance at the startled look on Si&#39;ren&#39;s face.
     &quot;No, no, I&#39;m fine,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a muted cough.  &quot;I have to admit
you have a wicked sense of payback, Azi&#39;mar.  I haven&#39;t been surprised like
this since.... well, to be honest it&#39;s only been a couple of days, but on the
scale of things....&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;tal?&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up as she took a cautious sip of her drink.  &quot;Word
of advice, enjoy your drink and be quiet.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; K&#39;tal replied in a faintly sullen tone.  He then blinked
hard as B&#39;nai grabbed him by the hair and yanked, almost slamming his head
against the back wall of the booth.  &quot;Ow, hey!&quot;
     &quot;Apparently you didn&#39;t read the house rules earlier,&quot; B&#39;nai said in a
chilling whisper.  &quot;You can take your uptight military ways and shove it right
up your....&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai?&quot; Azi&#39;mar sighed quietly in open resignation.  &quot;As much as it galls
me to say this, the Negaverse would be far better off in the long run if he
stays alive for the time being.  Trust me.  Now kindly let him go so I can get
this over with while I still have both the time and the courage.&quot;
     The bar-mistress gave him a level glare for a number of moments before she
finally let go of K&#39;tal&#39;s hair.  &quot;Whatever,&quot; she muttered as she wiped her hand
on the back of her pants and picked up the serving tray.  &quot;Try not to make too
much of a mess when you kill him,&quot; she said to Si&#39;ren before she turned away
and started to thread her way among the rest of the crowd in the bar.
     Si&#39;ren cast a visibly disturbed glance at B&#39;nai&#39;s back before turning to
give Azi&#39;mar an equally unsettled look.  &quot;Now I know why you wanted us to have
a few drinks beforehand,&quot; she opined as she took another sip of her crystalline
drink.  &quot;Forgive me, Azi&#39;mar, but I never knew you had any children.&quot;
     &quot;Likewise,&quot; K&#39;tal muttered before being discreetly elbowed by Tolaris.
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; Azi&#39;mar prodded casually before he picked up the bottle again.
He paused to shake it gently, peering inside the dark-colored bottle before
snorting in dismissal and pouring some of the jet-black contents out into the
empty glass in front of him.
     &quot;I once heard a rumor of you having an affair with someone else,&quot; Tolaris
replied before taking a moderate sip of his s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue.  &quot;Nothing ever
came up to substantiate that, however, so no official notation was ever made.&quot;
     &quot;A short but intense affair with a fellow soldier,&quot; Azi&#39;mar explained
quietly as he stared into the dark liquid in his glass.  &quot;Her contraceptive
implant must have expired a little faster than expected.  She wouldn&#39;t name me
to her superiors, ended up with an official reprimand.  Died in childbirth,&quot; he
added bitterly as he tossed back almost the entire drink.
     &quot;Sorry to hear that,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up quietly, giving him a somber look.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied once he finished swallowing.  &quot;To make a long
story short, B&#39;nai wound up in the care of her grandparents.  I didn&#39;t identify
myself to her until I thought she was old enough to understand.  Big mistake,&quot;
he added with a hollow snort of what might have been ironic amusement.
     &quot;This explains an awful lot,&quot; K&#39;tal said, casting a brief glance across
the room at B&#39;nai before looking back at Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;Or at least half of my
headache tonight.  I don&#39;t suppose you&#39;d be so kind as to explain the other
half while you&#39;re still sober?&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;tal, if you don&#39;t settle down I&#39;m going to take you outside and no-
navidshi electrocute you,&quot; Tolaris said in a faintly irritated tone, casting a
warning look at his fellow Dragoon.  &quot;And yes, the s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blues I&#39;ve had
in the past were never as potent as this one is,&quot; he added with a gesture of
his own neon concoction.
     &quot;Your associate has a valid concern, I have to admit,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up
after taking a measured sip of her own drink.  &quot;While I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all had
our own issues with family and blood-kin, they are not exactly something one
usually discusses in the open.  Or gets blatantly drunk over,&quot; she added as
Azi&#39;mar poured out another measure of inky darkness into his glass.
     &quot;Very well,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied calmly.  &quot;As much as I would like to enjoy
your company for the evening, Si&#39;ren, I will get to the point if you truly are
that impatient.  The nuclear missile strike on the Imperial Castle,&quot; he sighed
as he picked up his glass and swirled it around gently.
     &quot;Please tell me that really was Rune&#39;s idea,&quot; Si&#39;ren sighed as she felt a
dark chill start to form in her abdomen.
     &quot;Oh, it was,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied with a somber nod.  &quot;And yes, the order to
remove the warhead&#39;s fuse was clearly received.  What I am going to tell you
now stays between the four of us, as I see no need for certain details to be
put into the official report.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps you should start with the official version?&quot; Tolaris suggested.
     &quot;Officially, my second-in-command disobeyed a direct order,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said
flatly before taking another large gulp of the now-extinct fruit alcohol blend.
&quot;She was having an affair with a soldier who was killed by the nuclear blast
out by the Hinterland rift after someone got trigger-happy on Nop&#39;tera&#39;s ship,
and saw Rune&#39;s orders as an opportunity to get revenge on both Nop&#39;tera and
Rune for his death.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren blinked and sat up straight.  &quot;And this can be proven?&quot;
     &quot;Closed-circuit surveillance recording of her re-inserting the fuse and
removing the safety pins shortly before the warhead was spun up,&quot; Azi&#39;mar
murmured as he stared down at his drink.  &quot;I don&#39;t have any proof of her
confession afterwards, however.  The cameras aren&#39;t everywhere.&quot;
     Tolaris and K&#39;tal traded looks.  &quot;Sounds like high treason to me,&quot; K&#39;tal
spoke up in a careful tone as he took another sip of his drink.
     &quot;Without question,&quot; Si&#39;ren nodded as she looked at Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;So tell me
why you think your life is forefit instead of hers?&quot;
     &quot;Because she&#39;s already dead,&quot; Azi&#39;mar growled quietly, causing everyone to
lean back slightly at the intense anger in his tone.  &quot;I confronted her once I
understood what she had done..... and why.  Enraged at the betrayal, I killed
her on the spot,&quot; he said before tossing back the last of his drink.
     Si&#39;ren paused and raised a delicate white eyebrow.  &quot;I&#39;m still not seeing
your concern, Azi&#39;mar,&quot; she said very carefully.  &quot;As long as it can be proven
she acted alone....&quot;
     &quot;Which can&#39;t be proven now that she&#39;s dead,&quot; Azi&#39;mar interrupted.  &quot;Who&#39;s
to say I didn&#39;t give her a verbal order and killed her to cover it up?  And
let&#39;s not forget the responsibility of command.  Rune is going to want someone
to publicly pay for this, and it happened on my watch under my command.  I&#39;ve
no illusions of any sort of clemency or mercy from General Rune if offering up
my head on a stick will save her own ptanka.&quot;
     &quot;Mmm, that does seem a little grim indeed,&quot; K&#39;tal muttered as he took a
cautious sip of his overly-strong drink.
     &quot;A question for you, if I may,&quot; Tolaris spoke up as Si&#39;ren remained silent
and stared into the depths of her own drink.  &quot;I was there when Master Chief
D&#39;Nina received a Priority-One message from you, before the missile launch.&quot;
     &quot;From my personal cipher,&quot; the one-eyed man corrected him with a sigh.
&quot;That&#39;s the other reason Rune will have my head.  I assure you I didn&#39;t send a
message to either D&#39;Nina or to Rune, but there&#39;s no way I can prove that beyond
anyone&#39;s doubt as my cipher was indeed used.&quot;
     &quot;So who used it?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired softly, still studying the half-melted
ice chips in her drink.
     &quot;Lieutenant-Colonel Sha&#39;an, my second-in-command,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied as he
emptied the last dregs of the bottle into his glass.  &quot;How she obtained it, I
don&#39;t have a clue.  Officially,&quot; he added with a shrug before taking a deep
drink.
     &quot;And unofficially?&quot; Si&#39;ren prodded finally looking up at him and studying
the red starburst design on his eye-patch.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just say that she had free access to my personal quarters,&quot; he
grumbled before he tipped his head back and downed the last of the jet-black
liquid.  The empty glass was then half-slammed onto the table in an unconscious
gesture of anger and frustration that spoke volumes in of itself.
     &quot;Just so we&#39;re clear about this, Azi&#39;mar,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she returned
her gaze to her drink, idly running her fingertip around the rim in a slow
circle.  &quot;You were having an affair with your second-in-command, and she used
your cipher to both warn the Dragoons before and taunt General Rune after she
had deliberately armed a nuclear warhead in direct violation of Rune&#39;s orders.
After confronting her with proof, you learned of her motives, discovered that
you were not the only person she was having an affair with, and killed her in
a fit of jealous rage.  Is that a fair summary, then?&quot;
     A truly dark snort rose up from Azi&#39;mar&#39;s chest as he set both the empty
bottle and his glass on the far edge of the table where it could be easily
picked up by B&#39;nai later.  &quot;As the old joke goes, Si&#39;ren, it&#39;s close enough for
government work.  For my own reasons I would prefer that the affair part be
left out if possible.  Otherwise, I&#39;m not about to argue that the ultimate
responsibility for the missile strike lies with someone other than me.  It was
my missile unit, my silo, my warhead, my team that launched it.  If that means
I answer with my life.... so be it.  And unlike a few others I can name, none
of whom are at this table, I&#39;m not going to try to let Rune take the blame for
this one as her orders were crystal clear.&quot;
     &quot;If it means anything, Azi&#39;mar,&quot; Tolaris spoke up quietly, &quot;Speaking only
for myself and for what it&#39;s worth, your honesty and integrity is sincerely
appreciated.  Not that there&#39;s anything I can do about this, of course.&quot;
     &quot;I suppose I should be grateful for the sentiment,&quot; the one-eyed colonel
grumbled absently as a series of flashing lights on the performance stage
caught his attention.  &quot;In any case, confessing my sins is only part of the
reason I asked you to come here.&quot;
     &quot;There&#39;s more?&quot; K&#39;tal coughed, almost swallowing his drink the wrong way
and thumping his chest fairly hard.  &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, now I know what B&#39;nai
meant about this stuff putting hair on my chest.&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;tal, not now,&quot; Tolaris sighed.  &quot;With all due respect, Azi&#39;mar, I think
you&#39;re being entirely too pessimistic here.  First of all, Queen Beryl isn&#39;t
with us anymore, so a summary execution by royal fiat is not an option.  Rune
would still have to call a proper tribunal first, and that alone would take a
day or two.  And as long as what you&#39;ve told us is the absolute truth, you can
still be exonerated on the high treason charges.&quot;
     &quot;Actually, forming a tribunal will take a lot longer than a day or two,&quot;
Si&#39;ren spoke up quietly, still staring into the depths of her cocktail.
     &quot;How so?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired in a very guarded tone, giving her a faintly
wary look.
     &quot;You&#39;re a division commander,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied.  &quot;We&#39;d need a panel of
three flag-rank officers, and Rune would not be allowed to sit in judgment at
a trial where she herself also stands accused of treasonous activity.  Not that
the charges will remain once you testify, but that will still preclude her from
being on the panel.  That really only leaves Brigadier Zan&#39;zemet and myself, as
Al&#39;vexi is legally retired and not able to sit in judgment, and I have reason
to believe Zan&#39;zemet would recuse herself for reasons of personal conflict.&quot;
     &quot;Another affair?&quot; K&#39;tal inquired cautiously, only to hiss in pain as a
jolt of electricity was sent through his shoulder by Tolaris.  &quot;Hey, hey, hey,
I&#39;m not trying to be a wise-guy here, alright?  I&#39;m just pointing out what I as
a Dragoon perceive to be is a pattern of misconduct that will not be cast in
any sort of favorable light.&quot;
     &quot;To be perfectly fair,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up in a level tone, casting a fairly
unamused look at both K&#39;tal and Tolaris, &quot;Zan&#39;s job brings her into distinctly
personal contact with just about everyone and would most likely be excused for
medical ethics.  Although, seeing how we&#39;re being fair here,&quot; she added in a
rather dry tone, &quot;There probably aren&#39;t any senior officers she hasn&#39;t slept
with in the course of her duties at some point in time.&quot;
     &quot;Anything you want to tell us?&quot; K&#39;tal asked lightly as he went to take a
sip of his s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue, only to nearly spill the drink as Tolaris zapped
his arm with another jolt of electricity.  &quot;With all due respect, Tolaris, that
is getting to be quite irksome.&quot;
     &quot;Trust me, I&#39;m starting to understand just how patient a woman Sailor
Neptune truly is in the face of persistant annoyances,&quot; Tolaris muttered.
     &quot;So I take it Al&#39;vexi was right and that Sailor Moon has recruited a few
new Sailor Scouts?&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up as she gave Tolaris a somewhat uneasy look.
A slight frown crossed her face as the elder Dragoon simply leaned back in the
booth and made a minor show of taking a very protracted drink from his glass.
     &quot;I think there&#39;s too much sleen in this,&quot; Tolaris finally said to Azi&#39;mar
once he put the now half-empty glass down.  &quot;Or was that deliberate?&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar merely shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to discuss that with
B&#39;nai,&quot; he pointed out.  &quot;I didn&#39;t ask her to make anything for you ahead of
time since I figured you and K&#39;tal were too straight-laced to drink.&quot;
     &quot;All things in moderation,&quot; Tolaris replied with a shrug of his own.
     &quot;You know.... I just thought of something,&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up in a somewhat
contemplative tone as he absently studied the ice in Si&#39;ren&#39;s glass.  He kept
his focus on the translucent squares before carefully looking up at both Si&#39;ren
and Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to run this past a magistrate, of course, since it
is a somewhat arcane practice.... but what about the Mind Truth defense?  If
Azi&#39;mar is telling the truth about what happened and why, it can be used to
prove his innocence.  Or at least in regards to the question of treason.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren cocked her head to one side.  &quot;The what?&quot;
     &quot;You get three telepaths together,&quot; K&#39;tal explained.  &quot;The panel gets to
name one, Azi&#39;mar chooses the second, and everyone has to agree on who the
third member is.  The telepaths form a mind-link, delve into Azi&#39;mar&#39;s mind
together, and learn the truth.  The practice was discontinued ages ago because
of the tendency for new charges to be filed against the accused once the mind-
sifting results were in, but when your options are either death for treason or
a black mark on your career for breaking the rules regarding personal conduct
within the ranks....&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar blinked hard and exchanged startled looks with Si&#39;ren.  &quot;I&#39;ll be
honest with you, K&#39;tal,&quot; the one-eyed colonel said slowly, &quot;The idea of having
someone else rooting around inside my mind looking for dirt doesn&#39;t sit well
with me in the slightest.&quot;
     &quot;And execution does?&quot; K&#39;tal countered.  &quot;I&#39;m just tossing out an idea to
try to see that justice is done, nothing more.  If you&#39;re going to end up being
disciplined, it may as well be for something you truly did instead of something
you didn&#39;t do.&quot;
     &quot;Thank you, K&#39;tal, I feel so much better now,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied dryly.
     &quot;Actually, you might not need a.... now what?&quot; Tolaris started to say,
only to be interrupted by an outburst of light and sound from the performance
stage.  The crowd started to react an instant later, the noise of conversation
almost doubling in volume as chairs were turned around and reshuffled so that
everyone could get a good view of the stage.
     &quot;Use your imagination,&quot; Azi&#39;mar laughed before he carefully looked around
the bar.  He finally spotted B&#39;nai as she made her way back towards the front
with an almost overflowing tray filled with empty glasses and bottles, raising
an arm to try to flag her attention.
     &quot;Any surprises we need to watch out for?&quot; K&#39;tal inquired as he shifted
slightly to allow him to keep one eye on the stage without straining his neck.
     &quot;No, it&#39;s just the usual hiana and k&#39;vesana,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said off-handedly,
holding up his empty bottle when B&#39;nai glanced over at him.  She promptly gave
him a dark scowl before giving him a sour nod and continued on her way back to
the bar.  &quot;Some of the dancers are a little more.... shall we say, blatantly
open about their intentions, but others are a little more....&quot;
     &quot;Artistic?&quot; Tolaris spoke up in a perfectly unreadable tone.
     &quot;T&#39;Del has a bit of a following,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied with a casual shrug.
&quot;Both in the audience and among her fellow performers.  Some of the girls have
changed their choreography to match.  Less sexuality, more sensuality.&quot;
     &quot;You sound like you spend a lot of time here,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out as she
cast a sidelong glance at Azi&#39;mar.
     A quiet huff of idle amusement rose up from Azi&#39;mar&#39;s chest.  &quot;Not nearly
as much as you think,&quot; he countered calmly.  &quot;I hear about what goes on behind
the curtain, as it were, simply because a few of them work for me.&quot;
     &quot;Like T&#39;Del?&quot; Tolaris murmured as he took a sip of his drink.
     &quot;If you want to put things in those terms,&quot; the Training Commander allowed
with a slight tilt of his head.  &quot;But I meant more in a direct sense.  Take
her, for example,&quot; he added with a gesture as the stage curtain suddenly parted
to reveal a dancer in a skin-tight outfit.
     K&#39;tal raised an eyebrow.  &quot;Was that a suggestion or a reference?&quot;
     &quot;I can&#39;t take you anywhere, can I?&quot; Tolaris sighed softly, trading weary
looks with Si&#39;ren.
     &quot;You&#39;re no fun, Tolaris,&quot; K&#39;tal replied, keeping most of his attention on
the stage where the dancer was slowly stretching.  &quot;So I take it our athletic
friend on the stage is assigned to the Training Division?&quot;
     &quot;A junior but fully-commissioned officer,&quot; Azi&#39;mar murmured as he cast a
glance towards the bar.  &quot;Not the most straight-laced of soldiers, but she is
a capable technician and usually receives high marks from her superiors for the
quality of her work.  Teasing a crowd just happens to be her idea of fun, and
as long as it doesn&#39;t conflict with her duties I don&#39;t see a problem.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; K&#39;tal mused.  &quot;So what do you think?&quot;
     It took Si&#39;ren a moment to realize that the younger Dragoon was talking to
her.  &quot;Excuse me?&quot; she said, giving him a faintly suspicious look.
     &quot;There&#39;s no excuse for him,&quot; Tolaris spoke up as he tossed back the last
dregs of his drink and set the empty glass back down.  &quot;So back to the original
topic of discussion, or at least the last one I remember,&quot; he said, ignoring
the unamused look on K&#39;tal&#39;s face and the still leery look on Si&#39;ren&#39;s.  &quot;As I
was saying, Azi&#39;mar, you might not need a military tribunal at all.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar raised an eyebrow in response, giving the Dragoon a measured look.
&quot;At the risk of asking an obvious question, Tolaris, I take it that you know
something I don&#39;t in regards to my situation?&quot;
     &quot;Why bother with a military tribunal?&quot; Tolaris said as he leaned back and
folded his hands in his lap.  &quot;Ask for summary judgment by royal fiat.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar promptly narrowed his good eye.  &quot;Maybe the alcohol is affecting
me a little faster than anticipated, Tolaris,&quot; he growled quietly, &quot;But I seem
to recall you saying a few minutes ago how I didn&#39;t have to worry about that.
Something about Queen Beryl being deceased.&quot;
     &quot;I said you don&#39;t have to worry about a summary execution by royal fiat,&quot;
Tolaris countered.  &quot;Summary judgment by royal fiat just might still be an
option, depending how how the laws are worded.&quot;
     &quot;Prince Darian?&quot; Si&#39;ren said carefully as she sat up straight.  She cast
a brief sidelong glance at the stage as there was a low roar from the crowd,
one delicate white eyebrow arching up as she realized that the dancer was in
the process of very slowly taking off her form-fitting top.
     &quot;Indeed,&quot; Tolaris said somberly as he leaned forward to rest his elbows on
the table.  &quot;Darian is, without a doubt, our Crown Prince.  I&#39;ve seen the mark
on his forehead myself, and he told us about his meeting with the NegaForce.
Now while that doesn&#39;t give him much executive power in terms of authority over
the military, he does have a certain measure of legal authority.&quot;
     &quot;How much?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired in a low tone.
     Tolaris sighed and sat back against the booth cushions.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure,
you&#39;ll have to ask a magistrate,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;It&#39;s possible he might not be
able to stand in summary judgment, but what harm could there be in asking?  I
know Darian personally and I know he&#39;s a fair and honest man.  And while I&#39;m
not about to make any promises here, I think it&#39;s safe to say that the idea of
having you executed as punishment won&#39;t readily cross his mind.&quot;
     &quot;Si&#39;ren?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired in a very wary tone as he glanced over at the
white-haired admiral.
     &quot;Tolaris is right,&quot; Si&#39;ren admitted with a shrug as she sat back and took
an absent sip of her drink.  &quot;I will have to ask a magistrate.&quot;
     &quot;Any gut feelings to put our one-eyed friend at ease, maybe?&quot; K&#39;tal said
as he cast a measured glance towards the half-naked dancer on the stage.
     Si&#39;ren glanced up over the rim of her glass to look at him.  &quot;Somehow, I
don&#39;t think Azi&#39;mar would appreciate any false hopes,&quot; she said coolly.  &quot;As I
said, I will have to talk to a magistrate first before we can start making any
plans to ask Prince Darian to intervene in a purely military matter.  Speaking
loosely of our Crown Prince,&quot; she continued, pausing to take another sip of her
crystalline green cocktail, &quot;When did you plan on officially informing your
chain-of-command that you intended to host a meeting with Sailor Moon in order
to officially document her rumored half-denizen lineage?&quot;
     K&#39;tal blinked and cast a truly unsettled glance towards her before sighing
heavily and tossing back the remains of his drink in a single gulp.  &quot;Not until
after she was safely back on Earth,&quot; he admitted as he turned his full focus to
her.  &quot;Due respect, Ad.... er, my lady,&quot; he interrupted himself as he cast a
brief glance towards the approaching figure of B&#39;nai.  &quot;But the entire point
of keeping it quiet was to avoid yet another assassination attempt on her life
or on the lives of her Sailor Scouts.  Back for more, ne&#39;ana?&quot; he purred as the
bar-mistress came within earshot.
     &quot;Don&#39;t make me toss you outside,&quot; B&#39;nai growled as she tossed out another
set of wafer-thin cardboard coasters.  She then started to set small bottles
and even smaller cups in front of everyone before scooping up the empty bottle
and dirty glasses.  &quot;You should finish that before starting in on the mi&#39;po,&quot;
she added with a gesture of her chin to Si&#39;ren&#39;s half-empty glass of K&#39;seren
Six.
     &quot;Mi&#39;po?&quot; K&#39;tal echoed as he carefully studied the small bottle.
     &quot;First time, Dragoon?&quot; B&#39;nai said, suddenly pausing in mid-motion to give
him a guarded look.
     &quot;They don&#39;t let me out much,&quot; K&#39;tal confessed, giving her a neutral look.
     &quot;With good reason,&quot; Tolaris murmured as he carefully picked up his bottle
and started to peel the wax seal off.  He paused in mid-motion as the crowd
began to quietly roar with approval as the stripper on the stage began to work
the fastenings of her pants, casting a brief glance towards the stage before
shaking his head to himself.
     &quot;It&#39;s from the Outreaches,&quot; Azi&#39;mar explained as he likewise started to
unseal his bottle of the exotic and extremely potent wine.  &quot;The bottles are
small for a reason, which should clue you in about the potency of it.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren raised a delicate eyebrow as she continued to sip her vibrant green
cocktail.  &quot;Trying to get me drunk or something?&quot; she inquired archly.
     A dark sneer crossed B&#39;nai&#39;s face.  &quot;Isn&#39;t that page one of a guy&#39;s book
on how to seduce women?&quot; she suggested.  &quot;Turn it the other way, you fool,&quot; she
added to K&#39;tal as he struggled with the bottle&#39;s top.  &quot;It&#39;s a safety measure.
If you&#39;re too drunk or too stupid to read the instructions on the cap, then you
don&#39;t need to be drinking it.&quot;
     &quot;Backwards bar, backwards bottles,&quot; K&#39;tal commented with a dismissive
shrug of his shoulders before twisting the cap in the opposite direction.  He
then became perfectly still as B&#39;nai&#39;s serving tray hit the table with a muted
clatter and he suddenly found himself almost nose-to-nose with her.
     &quot;You know, you&#39;re awful mouthy for a desk-bound paper-pushing p&#39;tai,&quot; she
snarled in a dangerously soft tone.  &quot;If you don&#39;t like the way things are done
around here, you are *cordially* invited to get the hell out of my bar and go
run your own.&quot;
     &quot;And you&#39;re awfully uptight for someone who chooses to deal with people
for a living,&quot; K&#39;tal countered calmly as he studied the gray coloring of her
eyes.  &quot;You really should try to relax every now and then.  Who knows, you just
might end up being approached and seduced for a gentle night instead of having
to cower behind a veil of harsh ice, watching as others around you indulge in
the kind of affections you seem to crave yet actively deny yourself.&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai!&quot; Azi&#39;mar said sharply as the bar-mistress promptly swung her fist
back, her features a mask of dark rage.
     &quot;No, no, that&#39;s quite alright,&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up as he leaned back slightly
with a faint hint of a smile of satisfaction on his face.  &quot;Let her react if
I&#39;ve hit a raw nerve.  It wouldn&#39;t be the first time the truth has hurt me just
as much as it hurts someone else.  You&#39;ll be alright, ne&#39;ana, won&#39;t you?&quot; he
added as he casually took a large swig from the bottle of mi&#39;po.
     Both Si&#39;ren and Tolaris raised their eyebrows at how fast K&#39;tal set the
bottle back on the table, his eyes almost doubling in diameter.  The younger
Dragoon swallowed as discreetly as he could and reached out to get a subtle but
firm grip on the table in front of him.
     &quot;Burns on the way down, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; B&#39;nai cooed in a mock-purr, giving
K&#39;tal a distinctly feral look as she lowered her fist.
     &quot;A little,&quot; K&#39;tal rasped, his voice barely audible.
     &quot;Are you two finished?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired cautiously as she cast a glance
towards the now-naked dancer moving around on the stage.  &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be
rude, B&#39;nai, but you should simply ignore him like the rest of us do and don&#39;t
let him get under your skin.  And as for you, K&#39;tal....&quot; she added in a faint
tone of warning.  &quot;Protocol restrictions be damned, I&#39;m giving you a direct
order to knock off the navidshi.&quot;
     K&#39;tal simply nodded quickly, still holding onto the table for support as
his throat continued to burn with an unusual intensity.  He glanced over at
B&#39;nai for a number of moments before a faint smirk crossed his face, bowing his
head in a gesture of understanding.
     &quot;Need some water, I take it?&quot; B&#39;nai said with a casual sneer.
     &quot;It would be appreciated,&quot; K&#39;tal managed to say without wincing as his
throat painfully protested the attempt at speaking.
     &quot;I believe that water would be best from this point onward,&quot; Tolaris said
in a neutral tone as he cast a wary glance down at his small cup of mi&#39;po.  &quot;Or
at least it would be for me,&quot; he amended with a quick glance up at both Si&#39;ren
and Azi&#39;mar.
     &quot;Can&#39;t hold your liquor either?&quot; B&#39;nai inquired archly as she picked up
her serving tray.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know how robust your liver is,&quot; Tolaris replied calmly as he sat
back to give her a measured look, &quot;But I know mine can&#39;t cope with this much
alcohol on an empty stomach.&quot;
     A faint snort of contempt rose up from the bar-mistress&#39; chest before she
started to turn away.  &quot;Try the Dirty Devil just down the road, they&#39;re always
open.  Just watch out for the spiced oratu dishes.  Depending on which cook is
in the kitchen, they&#39;ll either be the best steaks you&#39;ll find for five hundred
miles or they&#39;ll keep you holed up in the bathroom until sunrise.  Sometimes
both,&quot; she warned before she left to carry the dirty glasses over to the bar.
     &quot;Sadly enough, she&#39;s not kidding,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said dryly as he poured a small
amount of mi&#39;po into his glass and picked it up.  &quot;Word of advice, K&#39;tal?&quot; he
added as he noticed that the younger Dragoon was still visibly suffering from
the acid-like stinging of the alcohol.  &quot;Breathe through your nose and keep
quiet.&quot;
     &quot;So back to where we were,&quot; Tolaris prompted in a neutral tone, pausing to
cast a leery glance towards the stage as the crowd noise increased for several
seconds before settling back down.  A new dancer was taking the stage, one clad
in a rather garish outfit that he personally felt didn&#39;t do much of anything
for her seemingly youthful figure.
     &quot;You know, I really should find this amusing,&quot; Si&#39;ren commented as she
took another cautious sip of her K&#39;seren Six.  &quot;Not a full hour ago I was in
uniform at the dinner table in the Imperial Palace discussing the merits of
trying to get Prince Darian involved in events.  Now I&#39;m wearing a cocktail
dress sitting in a seedy tavern in the middle of the mountains, of all places,
and the subject of Prince Darian comes up again.  I&#39;m starting to get the very
disturbing feeling that this isn&#39;t a simple coincidence,&quot; she sighed.
     Tolaris and Azi&#39;mar exchanged faintly unsettled glances before Tolaris
carefully cleared his throat.  &quot;Would you mind if I asked whom you were talking
to at the time and the exact nature of the conversation?&quot; he inquired in an
openly leery tone before taking a tentative sip of his mi&#39;po.  &quot;Ow,&quot; he rasped
as his throat promptly seemed to catch fire.
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; K&#39;tal said in a hoarse whisper.
     Si&#39;ren gave Tolaris a measured look before tossing back the last mouthful
of her neon-green drink.  &quot;General Ar&#39;kanis of the Imperial Red Wings,&quot; she
said simply.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Tolaris, Azi&#39;mar, and K&#39;tal all said in perfect unison as they sat
up straight.
     Si&#39;ren merely raised a delicate white eyebrow.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that he
felt it was necessary to speak to me directly about a few matters of purported
importance to General Nop&#39;tera, although not directly on her behalf.  One of
the things discussed was how Nop&#39;tera would most likely react if Prince Darian
was to involve himself in the.... situation between her and General Rune.&quot;
     &quot;And just how would she react?&quot; Tolaris inquired before taking another
very careful sip of the extremely potent Outreaches alcohol.
     Si&#39;ren simply made an idle gesture with her empty glass before setting it
down and picking up her still-sealed bottle of mi&#39;po.  &quot;The impression I got
was that, while she wouldn&#39;t instantly obey his word with the same fervor as
she would an instruction from the NegaForce, she would still nonetheless give
great weight to whatever he had to say.&quot;
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; Tolaris commented in a neutral tone, casting a brief glance
towards the stage just in time to catch the dancer finish stripping off her top
with a flourish that drew cheers from the crowd.  &quot;So I take it that Darian
should be warned to expect a visit from the Red Wings in the visible future?&quot;
     &quot;Most likely,&quot; Si&#39;ren admitted as she too cast a momentary glance towards
the action on the stage.  &quot;However, if he is planning on accompanying his Moon
Princess to her meeting with you, then I&#39;m sure arrangements can be made for
another meeting to take place afterwards.  A neutral one, of course,&quot; she added
as she saw the way Tolaris&#39; expression suddenly changed.
     &quot;One where you can personally guarantee their safety?&quot; Tolaris asked in an
openly guarded tone, giving the white-haired admiral a suspicious look.
     Si&#39;ren took her time in peeling the wax off of her bottle of mi&#39;po and
opening it, pouring the contents into the same glass her K&#39;seren Six had been
in.  &quot;To be bluntly honest, Tolaris?&quot; she finally said without looking up at
him, her eyebrows arching up slightly as she noticed what the mi&#39;po was doing
to the few remaining ice cubes left.  &quot;I can guarantee Darian&#39;s security.  I
can make no such promises in regards to Sailor Moon or her Sailor Scouts.  We
still have outstanding warrants for their immediate arrest, after all.&quot;
     &quot;That&#39;s unfortunate,&quot; Tolaris replied in a flat tone as he tossed back the
rest of his mi&#39;po and tried not to choke.
     &quot;Tolaris,&quot; K&#39;tal rasped quietly, giving him an uneasy look.
     &quot;It&#39;s simple, Si&#39;ren,&quot; Tolaris said darkly, ignoring the other Dragoon.
&quot;Guarantee that they won&#39;t be bothered, and I can personally promise you that
nobody gets hurt or even looked at the wrong way.  Try to arrest them, and you
will have a very nasty fight on your hands once they start resist.  And let me
assure you,&quot; he added ominously as he leaned forward, giving Si&#39;ren a piercing
look, &quot;If you threaten Serena or any other Sailor Scout in any way, shape, or
form, the others *will* take defensive action.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren paused in mid-motion for several seconds, giving him a guarded look
before putting the now-empty bottle aside and gingerly picking up her glass.
&quot;Thank you for the warning, Tolaris,&quot; she said carefully, &quot;But I&#39;m not sure I
can afford to overlook certain political concerns once they set foot inside our
world again.  I&#39;m sure you understand,&quot; she added dryly before taking a small
sip of her mi&#39;po.
     &quot;This is bigger than politics, Si&#39;ren,&quot; Tolaris persisted.
     &quot;Tell me something I don&#39;t know,&quot; the admiral growled back, causing the
rest of the group to blink at her tone.  &quot;I have General Rune breathing down my
neck, I have Nop&#39;tera&#39;s vengeful wrath to worry about, and I have to keep tabs
on what some human girl from another world is doing in addition to trying to
run the rest of the military.  I assure you, Tolaris, I know just how bad the
situation is right now, and how easily it can turn deadly in very short order
if something else decides to happen.&quot;
     The clinking of a glass of ice water on the table caused all four of them
to jump, heads jerking up to find B&#39;nai standing at the edge of the booth with
her serving tray heavily loaded with various beverages.  &quot;Doesn&#39;t anyone in the
military know how to hold their liquor anymore?&quot; she inquired, giving Si&#39;ren a
wary look.  &quot;Or are you just one of those angry drunks?&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s called the stress of responsibility,&quot; Azi&#39;mar spoke up, casting a
visibly amused glance at K&#39;tal as the Dragoon promptly downed half of the water
in a single gulp.  &quot;The main reason I had us meet in a bar was so that a few
drinks would make it easier for them to air their frustrations in a controlled
and productive manner.  And for all the animosity between us, B&#39;nai, I know we
won&#39;t have any problems with the proprietor blabbing whatever happens to be
overheard to the news media,&quot; he added with a faint smirk as he tossed back the
remainder of his mi&#39;po.
     &quot;Like the media ever comes here,&quot; B&#39;nai snorted.  &quot;And no, I don&#39;t care
what you have to say, just as long as you keep it down so nobody complains.
You&#39;re welcome,&quot; she added sarcastically to K&#39;tal as he drained the glass and
set it aside.
     &quot;Make up your mind, ne&#39;ana,&quot; K&#39;tal replied, giving her a remotely amused
look.  &quot;Not to suggest I&#39;m not grateful, mind you, but.... must you keep doing
that?&quot; he said as he turned around to glare at Tolaris after feeling another
jolt of electricity against his shoulder.
     &quot;If you&#39;re going to annoy her, you might as well go sit at the bar and do
it right,&quot; Tolaris sighed.  &quot;I&#39;m not saying I don&#39;t understand your situation,&quot;
he said as he turned back to Si&#39;ren.  &quot;I&#39;m just saying that you are going to
end up doing more harm than good if you confront them.  If you want to meet
with Darian, that&#39;s one thing.  If you want to try to arrest the Sailor Scouts,
that&#39;s something else entirely.&quot;
     &quot;I can&#39;t have them running around the Negaverse,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied in a low
tone, casting the briefest of sidelong glances at B&#39;nai before refocusing on
the elder Dragoon.  &quot;We shouldn&#39;t have any problems if Prince Darian comes by
himself, and I just *might* be able to get away with letting Sailor Moon come
with him.... by herself.  If the others come with her....&quot;
     &quot;Which they will,&quot; Tolaris interrupted carefully.  &quot;With all due respect,
Si&#39;ren, I know you&#39;re smart enough to grasp this.  Darian may be willing to
come alone, but there is absolutely no way that the others will allow Serena to
enter our world without them coming along to protect her.  And after the sort
of treatment she got the last time she was here, I don&#39;t blame them one bit.&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai?&quot; Azi&#39;mar spoke up quietly.
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; B&#39;nai snorted as she turned away from the group with a dark
scowl.  &quot;Plot treason for all I care, it&#39;s not my concern.  Have fun cutting
his head off,&quot; she added to Si&#39;ren before she strode away to deliver a round
of drinks to one of the other tables.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just hope she&#39;s as discreet as you suggest,&quot; K&#39;tal muttered.
     &quot;She looks after her bar and her paying patrons,&quot; Azi&#39;mar assured him as
he cast a glance towards the stage just as the naked dancer waved to the crowd
before slipping behind the curtains.  &quot;Which is the only reason she even gives
me the time of day, I might add.  She ignores gossip, even when she shouldn&#39;t,
but that&#39;s just her way of coping with life.  Tolaris?&quot; he added quietly.
     &quot;Yes?&quot; Tolaris asked in a wary tone.  He visibly hesitated as Azi&#39;mar made
a gesture with his bottle of mi&#39;po towards the stage, giving the one-eyed man
a deeply unsettled look before turning to see what he was pointing at.
     The stage was empty now, but only for a moment as the curtain was brushed
aside to let T&#39;Del walk on.  She was dressed in what appeared to be her normal
duty clothes, a pair of coarse and heavy overalls and seemingly little else.
Her steel-toed boots made a heavy thumping noise as she crossed the full length
of the stage towards the jukebox.  The crowd noise had started to increase the
moment she had stepped onto the stage, but suddenly hushed down as she simply
smiled at them and made a gesture for silence.
     &quot;Is there something going on I should know about?&quot; Si&#39;ren inquired in a
low tone as she saw the change in Tolaris&#39; expression, his countenance taking
on a visibly pale-gray contrast.
     &quot;Let&#39;s just say that T&#39;Del and I are.... old friends,&quot; he murmured as he
watched T&#39;Del reach the jukebox and promptly open the front cover.  This was
apparently not anticipated by anyone, as the crowd started to very quietly talk
among themselves as they started to speculate on what she was doing.
     &quot;T&#39;Del?&quot; Si&#39;ren said as she sat up straight, casting a startled glance at
the redhead on stage.  &quot;The supermodel?  That&#39;s her on the stage?  Azi&#39;mar....&quot;
     &quot;Just sit back and enjoy the show,&quot; Azi&#39;mar suggested calmly as he emptied
the bottle of mi&#39;po into his glass and sat back against the booth cushions.
     T&#39;Del reached inside the open jukebox to pull out a wireless headset,
slipping it on and tapping the microphone briefly before nodding to herself as
the sound was heard on the stage speakers.  &quot;Good evening, how&#39;s everyone?&quot; she
asked as she gave the crowd a warm smile, eliciting a fairly loud roar in
response.  &quot;That&#39;s what I thought,&quot; she teased as she continued to mess with
the inside of the jukebox.  &quot;I&#39;m almost done, I just need to reshuffle a few
storage crystals here.... you don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; she inquired, giving them a
look of innocence.
     &quot;Sounds like a no to me,&quot; K&#39;tal muttered as the response was an almost
deafening outburst from the crowd before they settled back down.  He cast a
quick glance back at Tolaris and blinked, giving him a concerned glance.  &quot;Uh,
you don&#39;t look too good right now, Tolaris.  The mi&#39;po giving you heartburn?&quot;
     &quot;Quiet,&quot; Tolaris said, his voice barely audible as he continued to stare
at his childhood friend.  His response caused K&#39;tal and Si&#39;ren to exchange very
uneasy glances before returning their attention to the stage.
     &quot;There we go,&quot; T&#39;Del purred in a silken tone as she closed the cover to
the jukebox and pushed a button on the front panel.  The speakers promptly
began to play a strain of soft jazz-like music popular in the Southern Plains,
abruptly falling silent after a few seconds.  That prompted a scowl from the
redhead as she delivered a cautious but solid kick to the edge of the jukebox
frame, resulting in the music starting up again.  &quot;Loose crystal,&quot; she said to
the crowd with a casual shrug before making her way back towards the center of
the stage.
     &quot;Everyone here knows how women can be at times, right?&quot; she asked in a
light and casual tone as she reached out to grab one of the dancer poles, very
idly walking around it in a large circle.  The crowd roared back at her for a
few seconds, causing her to pause and glance over her shoulder coyly.  &quot;I heard
that,&quot; she said in a mock-stern tone to someone in the crowd.  &quot;You should know
better than to say such things.  No, I was talking about how women can find
themselves in unpredictable moods on a whim.  You know, a sudden urge to do
this, an impulse to do that, throwing caution to the desert winds as you....
well, do something you normally don&#39;t do,&quot; she said, her cheeks taking on a
fetching shade of red.
     She gave the crowd a smile as she briefly whirled around the pole, still
keeping one hand on it for balance.  &quot;I guess you can say I&#39;m in such a mood
tonight,&quot; she confessed.  &quot;Which is why I wanted to try something a little
different.  You don&#39;t mind, do you?&quot; she asked, using the same tone of crafted
innocence that she had used earlier.  A wave of noise promptly erupted from the
audience, bringing a knowing smile to her soft lips.
     K&#39;tal cast a quick glance at Si&#39;ren&#39;s glass of mi&#39;po before looking down
at the empty glass of water B&#39;nai had given him and his own half-empty bottle.
&quot;Pah,&quot; he murmured to the open air as he picked up the bottle and took a very
cautious swig, almost dropping it as his throat started to burn once again.
&quot;Any idea what she&#39;s up to?&quot; he rasped quietly to the rest of the group.
     &quot;For once, I&#39;m just as clueless to events as you are,&quot; Azi&#39;mar replied in
a muted tone, giving K&#39;tal a one-eyed look of remote amusement.  &quot;Which, I have
to admit, is part of the intrigue.  Si&#39;ren?&quot; he added.
     &quot;Quiet, both of you,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she sipped at her mi&#39;po, more
than a little curious and intrigued herself.
     &quot;I just wanted to check,&quot; T&#39;Del said demurely once the crowd had settled
back down again.  &quot;What I&#39;m going to do tonight is tell you a story, about the
night that never happened.  Oh, it really did happen,&quot; she added quickly as a
murmur rose up from the crowd.  &quot;Just not the way I wanted it to.  Let me start
with the true version, what really did happen that night....&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;vesi t&#39;zarn....&quot; Tolaris whispered softly to himself as his heart began
to painfully lurch in his chest.  &quot;The barn....&quot;
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Azi&#39;mar grunted as he glanced over at Tolaris, barely able to make
out the half-audible words.  He frowned slightly as the Dragoon merely shook
his head, the color visibly draining from his face as he listened to the sound
of T&#39;Del&#39;s voice.
     &quot;I grew up in a farming village in the Southern Flatlands,&quot; T&#39;Del said in
an almost longing tone as she pressed her back against the dancing pole, the
gesture thrusting her hips forward.  She began to slowly sway from side to
side, as if she were rubbing the exposed portion of her upper back against the
cool metal of the pole.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t say I was a country girl, as my family was
part of the commercial district, but we were definitely in a rural area.  There
was an abandoned barn within sight of my house, part of a neighboring property
that had fallen into ruin for one reason or another.  As a child, I used to
play in there all the time with my friends as all imaginative kids did.  As I
grew older, however, the nature of the play changed.... just a little....&quot;
     T&#39;Del closed her eyes for several moments, a soft smile visible on her
face as she listened to the murmuring of the crowd.  &quot;Now, now, not like that,&quot;
she purred, cracking one eye open to give the audience a look that was between
knowing and sultry.  &quot;I was a good little girl, honest.  I knew what went on in
the hayloft at night, when the sun was down and everyone had gone home....&quot;
     She gently pushed herself upright and began to slowly roam around the
stage at apparent random, reaching up to slowly run her fingertips through her
mane of fiery-red hair.  &quot;I found myself up there one night,&quot; she said, almost
in a whisper.  Her voice was still audible, however, thanks to the microphone
which automatically adjusted the gain in response to the change in volume.
&quot;Don&#39;t ask me how, as I forget, but it was innocent.  Now, now,&quot; she chided the
audience as a low whispering started up.  &quot;I&#39;m being perfectly serious here.
It was just me and a friend of mine.... my best friend....&quot; she murmured with
a quiet sigh and a faint, almost blissful smile.
     &quot;We used to talk a lot as all friends do,&quot; she said quietly.  &quot;You have no
idea how many days and weeks swept past us in the blink of an eye as we talked,
immersed in our own world of imagination.  Just him and I....&quot; she purred as
she closed her eyes again, reaching out to grab the pole and swing around in a
graceful dance-like movement.  She turned around to rest her back against the
pole again, leaving her body in profile to the majority of the audience.
     &quot;We talked that evening, as we always do,&quot; she continued in a low-pitched
tone.  &quot;For one reason or another, we wound up sitting in the hayloft.  Maybe
I went up the ladder first and he followed, maybe he went up there first....
I don&#39;t remember,&quot; she admitted with a shrug.  The gesture caused the front of
her overalls to flex slightly, accenting her feminine curves in a flattering
way.  &quot;But what I do remember is talking to him, and talking, and talking....
until we realized that we had talked for so long that the sun had set.  It was
dark out now, not the gentle hues of evening twilight but true darkness.  The
kind of darkness that one doesn&#39;t want to be caught in out in the wilderness.&quot;
     A faint shiver seemed to run through her as she closed her eyes briefly,
absently reaching up to run her hand over the front of her overalls.  &quot;We had
both survived the Chaos Factor by then,&quot; she murmured.  &quot;Between him and I, my
powers and his, we probably could have made it safely home.... but we felt it
would be too great of a risk.  The majority of the predators in the area were
motion-trackers, not heat-seekers, and so we decided it was safest to stay in
the hayloft until the dawn came.  Just him and I, alone in the hayloft....&quot;
     A soft chuckle rose up from her throat as the crowd started to murmur in
low tones again.  &quot;Remember what I said earlier?&quot; she reminded them as she very
carefully surveyed the crowd.  &quot;I&#39;m telling you what happened that night, the
night that never happened.  Alone in the hayloft with him.... and nothing ever
happened.  He was my best friend, too kind of a young man to even think about
such a thing with me.... and so nothing happened.  We slept with our backs to
one another, and even through our clothes I could feel the heat of his body,
so tantalizingly close to me.... so close, and yet so far.
     &quot;We awoke when the dawn came,&quot; she said softly, almost sadly as her hand
came up to brush her hair over her shoulder.  &quot;The villagers came looking for
us once the sun cleared the horizon, fearing we had gone missing.  When we were
found half-asleep in the barn we were almost executed on the spot by our upset
parents,&quot; she added, giving the audience a rueful chuckle that elicited a mild
amount of knowing laughter in response.  &quot;They were calmed down by sunset that
day, although we were still both grounded for weeks afterwards.  We started to
talk again once we had &#39;learned our lesson&#39; and were allowed play together as
best friends, and life went on in our little rural village.&quot;
     T&#39;Del paused to look up at the audience with a coy smile.  &quot;As I said,
that is what actually happened that night, the night that never happened.  But
ever since then, I&#39;ve often wondered.... what would have happened, had my best
friend been just a little braver when we were together.... alone.... up in the
hayloft?  What if he was just a little more daring that night....&quot;
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; Azi&#39;mar asked very quietly as the elder Dragoon slumped back
against the booth cushions, one hand still holding his ribcage.
     &quot;Remind me in the morning to see a Healer about this,&quot; Tolaris replied in
a broken whisper, his eyes never leaving the slender figure on the stage.  &quot;No,
I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; he added as Azi&#39;mar&#39;s head jerked around to give him a look of
open concern.  &quot;Trust me, Sailor Mercury has put a worse strain on me before.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks for the visual,&quot; Azi&#39;mar grumbled before he refocused on T&#39;Del,
his words drawing a distracted grunt of agreement from a captivated Si&#39;ren.
     &quot;We started out laying back to back,&quot; T&#39;Del purred as she leaned back to
press herself against the dancing pole.  &quot;Guarding one another&#39;s dreams, as it
is said.  But I could see him turning around at some point, snuggling up as he
very gently presses his body against mine, one arm coming around in a light and
hesitant touch....&quot;
     The softest of sighs escaped her lips as she brought her hand up to brush
over waist in slow motion.  &quot;Not a brazen touch,&quot; she breathed as she closed
her eyes, allowing her fingertips to lightly trace a prominent seam.  &quot;But a
gentle one, almost as if he were afraid of me.  I can hear his breath as he
moves just a tiny bit closer to me, able to feel the warmth tickle my ear as he
tries to inhale the scent of my hair without me knowing about it....&quot;
     She reached up to run her hand through her hair slowly before tilting her
head to one side, her face a mask of gentle bliss and pleasure as she continued
to speak to the crowd.  &quot;It would have been hard to resist him,&quot; she murmured,
&quot;To refuse his gentle touch.  Mmmmm, I&#39;m tingling just thinking about it,&quot; she
confessed in an even softer whisper.  &quot;I can feel the lightest of sensations as
his hand comes up to touch my hair, stroking me with a touch that trembles just
a little with his uncertainty, his hesitation.... and his anticipation....
     &quot;He would whisper my name first,&quot; she continued, still speaking in a soft,
almost throaty purr.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t need to say anything to assure him it was
more than alright, merely to reach up and touch him.... to gently bring the
soft warmth of his lips down to my neck and shoulder.  A simple kiss would be
all it takes,&quot; she whispered as her fingertips came up to brush across the side
of her throat.  &quot;Just one soft, gentle, tender kiss across my skin, and I would
be his for the night....
     &quot;I can already feel his fingertips caressing me,&quot; she breathed as she
leaned back against the pole with her head at an angle, baring the curves of
her neck and throat.  Her left hand came up to idly trace her contours, slowly
working her way across the edge of her jaw, down the side of her throat, and
across the expanse of her bare shoulder before gently coming down to rest on
the metal clasp of her right overall strap.  &quot;A slow touch,&quot; she continued to
whisper softly, &quot;One that brings chills to the nerves even as it sets them on
fire with gentle warmth.  I can see how he would pause for a moment, just for
a moment to look at me, to make sure I was still his.... before moving a lone
fingertip just a little further....&quot;
     The softest of clicking sounds could be heard as the clasp came undone,
audible to even the booth the four military officers were in.  A perfectly
silent rush of air followed, more felt than heard, as the audience collectively
exhaled after realizing that they had quit breathing in anticipation.  The
heavy strap slowly slid backwards to hang free from the seams on her lower
back, leaving her shoulder completely bared and exposing the outside swells of
her breast.
     &quot;You all remember how it was that first time you allowed such a thing,&quot;
T&#39;Del breathed as she very slowly started to trace the curve of her shoulder
with her fingertips, her eyes still closed and a look of bliss on her face.
&quot;The very first time someone was able to touch skin that nobody had ever been
allowed to touch, not that way.... how deliciously warm it feels, how you can
feel his pulse throbbing in his fingertips, how you can feel your own pulse
throbbing even faster beneath his light touch.... and how you want.... how you
*need*.... to feel his touch continue elsewhere....&quot;
     A second surge of silent air rose up from the audience as T&#39;Del&#39;s hand
slipped lower, brushing aside the loose flap of her overalls to almost but not
quite bare her breast.  The faintest suggestions of a moan could be heard from
the speakers as her fingertips came to rest at the very top of her feminine
flesh, working in very slow motion as they began to descend with deliberate
casualness.
     &quot;Knowing him,&quot; she whispered, her soft voice taking on an audibly husky
undertone, &quot;He would have kissed my neck again, to reassure me that he would be
every bit as gentle as I imagined he would be.  Mmm, to feel his lips nuzzling
my sensitive ear as he makes the lightest of contacts,&quot; she moaned, her hand
moving as if to suggest she was toying with something unseen by the audience.
&quot;The rest of the night could have easily passed with that much alone, with just
that one soft kiss on my neck and that one simple touch on my skin.... but for
the night that never happened, so much more would happen....&quot;
     T&#39;Del&#39;s eyes parted slightly as she moved, keeping her back against the
dancing pole as she came around to face the crowd.  &quot;You can&#39;t imagine,&quot; she
said in a low tone, &quot;How I ached to be touched, and yet felt so relaxed at the
same time.  I was putty in his gentle hands.... and we both knew it.  By then,
I simply had to taste his kiss on my lips, slowly rolling over until I could
gaze into his eyes, reaching up to caress that youthful, familiar face.... and
bring him down to me to savor a kiss.... our first, true kiss,&quot; she purred as
she pursed her lips for a number of moments, seeming to kiss an invisible
phantom in front of her.  &quot;Not the casual ones we had shared before, the ones
given by innocent children playing together in their worlds of imagination and
drama, but a genuine kiss that warms both the heart.... and the desire....&quot;
     &quot;You could have said something,&quot; Tolaris murmured quietly, almost silently
to himself as the left side of his ribcage continued to burn.  He didn&#39;t take
his eyes off of the stage as K&#39;tal reached back, placing the remainder of his
mi&#39;po in front of the elder Dragoon.  &quot;Thank you,&quot; Tolaris added absently as he
promptly downed the last mouthful of the acid-like drink.
     T&#39;Del suddenly gasped softly and arched her back, leaning her head back as
well to fully expose the curves of her throat.  &quot;His kisses on my throat would
have been like fire,&quot; she said in a silken tone that clearly spoke of gentle
pleasure, one hand coming up to caress her collarbone.  &quot;And for as hard as the
hayloft would be spinning around me at that point, both he and his touch would
have remained crystal clear and exquisitely delightful.  Never would he have
tried to rush anything.... always he would move slowly, gently, tenderly to
kiss and caress me, to savor the slow surrender of our innocence to one another
as only lovers can hope to experience....&quot;
     Time seemed to creep along at a glacial pace as her hand slid over to her
shoulder, teasing her flawless skin before moving down to the other clasp.  Her
fingertip seemed to dance around the metal in a slow circle before making the
slightest of flicking gestures, resulting in another nearly silent click that
somehow was still heard by everyone in the room.  The back strap slowly slid
away to clink against the metal dancing pole, the front of her overalls now
only held in place by her arm pressed against her chest.
     &quot;Would I have let him see me?&quot; she murmured as she gave the audience a
sultry look, her eyes barely open.  She slowly began to lower her arm, allowing
the front flap of material to inch its way downwards as well.  &quot;Would I have
let him touch me as no other had touched me before?  Even with as drunk as my
senses were with pleasue and excitement, even with as loud as my nerves and my
desires were singing.... I probably would have hesitated,&quot; she said, her arm
stopping just short of allowing the flap to fully fall free.  The curves of her
breasts were clearly visible, the lush valley of her cleavage heaving deeply
with every breath she took.
     &quot;But then he would have kissed me again,&quot; she whispered as she eased back
against the dancing pole until it pressed against her bare back, still keeping
the front half of her overalls just high enough to conceal her nipples.  &quot;His
soft and gentle lips would have melded to mine in a kiss that would have made
my toes tingle.... and in that instant, in that one single moment with his lips
upon mine.... I would be his for eternity....&quot;
     The front flap fell away just as she inhaled in a soft gasp, thrusting her
visibly tightened nipples into the deathly still air.  Her breasts were firm
and high, composed of the same utter flawlessness as the rest of her skin and
not seeming to be weighed down by the constant pull of gravity.  A soft murmur
rose up from the crowd a moment later, muted by the need to exhale and breathe
after realizing they had forgotten to do so a number of moments earlier.
     &quot;Ouch,&quot; K&#39;tal murmured very softly to himself, openly admiring T&#39;Del&#39;s
exposed curves.  Across from him, a quiet sound could be heard from Si&#39;ren as
she too seemed to be mesmerized by both T&#39;Del&#39;s beauty and the sensuality of
her performance.
     &quot;Oh, yes,&quot; T&#39;Del whispered very softly.  &quot;He would have reacted just like
that.... a gentle sigh of wonder and amazement as he was allowed to see me in
a whole new way.  To see me.... and to touch me,&quot; she added she began to very
slowly trail a lone fingertip along the curve of her throat.  Her fingernail
seemed to glitter in the spotlight as it meandered downward at an unhurried
pace, very lightly caressing every curve and contour.
     &quot;Words are not be able to describe how I feel at this point,&quot; she said
quietly as her finger encountered the soft swell of her breast.  &quot;How can you
explain to others how it feels to be standing on the cusp of adulthood, ready
in body but not yet in the mind or spirit, and slowly being drawn towards that
final line in the sand?  How can you describe how.... frightening it is to be
touched,&quot; she breathed as her fingertip lightly brushed over the hardened nub
of her nipple, &quot;And yet how empowering, how liberating it is at the same time?&quot;
     She turned her head to the side and pursed her lips again, as if giving a
phantom lover a soft yet deep kiss.  &quot;But for all that I am feeling, for all
that he can make me feel with his touch alone.... I wouldn&#39;t be afraid of him,&quot;
she murmured as she turned to put her body in profile to the audience.  &quot;How
can I be afraid of him, my best friend, and in some ways my only friend?  I
know he is just as.... hesitant as I am, being as new to him as it was to me,
but he still reaches out to me.... and I to him.&quot;
     The stage creaked very quietly as she began to move, taking several slow
and measured strides across it.  She seemed to pause briefly in the very center
of the stage before flexing her leg just right and bring it upwards, leaving
the heavy steel-toed boot behind.  Her other leg followed suit a moment later,
allowing her to continue bare-foot to the other side of the stage where the
other dancing pole was.
     T&#39;Del seemed to glide across the floor as she moved, reaching out to take
hold of the brass pole in one hand.  She then became a blur of motion, swinging
around in a tight arc to wind up pressed hard against the cool metal as if she
were embracing a lover.  Her lips seemed to briefly brush against it as she
thrust her chest forward, resting the soft valley of her cleavage against the
poll in a most inviting manner.
     &quot;Even in a crafted fantasy, I couldn&#39;t say for sure how I would react,&quot;
she purred very quietly as her head dipped forward to very lightly rest her
forehead against the dancing pole, her eyes gently closed.  &quot;Maybe I would be
slightly aggressive, taking hold of his overalls and unclasping them myself.
Maybe I would be giving him a gentle look, praying that he would be able to
read my thoughts and continue to be the one taking action.  Even now, as I
confess to you my deepest-held fantasy.... I can&#39;t say what I would have done
in response to his touch.
     &quot;But I know one thing,&quot; she whispered as she slowly turned around, resting
her bare back against the pole and leaving her breasts thrust forward.  &quot;I do
know that if he wanted to?  That if my best friend had wanted to take that next
step, to bring us both closer to that line in the sand?  I would have taken it
with him....&quot;
     The air seemed to turn deathly quiet as T&#39;Del began to flex her body in a
slow and deliberate manner.  She reached up to take hold of the pole with both
hands, leaving her chest arched forward in exquisite profile as the fabric of
her overalls began a very slow migration down her hips.
     &quot;You remember what it was like the first time,&quot; she breathed in a soft,
almost silent voice that was barely audible to the audience as she continued to
work her body in a very deliberate manner and rhythm.  &quot;The first time you felt
his fingertips brush across your clothes before very carefully moving them.
Tugging them this way, pushing them that way, pulling here, and there, and here
again.... until he got them right where he wanted them to be....&quot; she said as
she arched her back and closed her eyes.
     Time seemed to freeze in mid-motion as she held perfectly still before her
abdomen seemed to twitch once in a spasm.  The coarse fabric appeared to move
of its own accord after that, taking a virtual eternity to slide the rest of
the way over her hips before rushing down her legs in a controlled free-fall
to leave her body fully exposed on the stage.
     &quot;Nicely done,&quot; K&#39;tal murmured to himself as the audience seemed to exhale
as a single entity.  T&#39;Del remained motionless on the stage, not seeming to
even breathe as she raptly listened to the almost inaudible noise coming from
the truly captivated bar.
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; Azi&#39;mar asked very cautiously as he noticed a very faint glow
of energy surrounding the elder Dragoon&#39;s hand as he continued to clutch his
ribcage.  The one-eyed colonel blinked as he was answered with an almost broken
string of fragmented syllables that could have meant any number of things.
&quot;Wimp,&quot; he sighed in resignation as he refocused his attention on the stage.
     &quot;Hush,&quot; Si&#39;ren admonished quietly as she continued to study T&#39;Del&#39;s nude
figure on the stage.
     T&#39;Del very slowly began to move, lifting up one leg at a time to step out
of the puddle of rough fabric at her feet.  She then slowly turned around away
from the audience to gently press herself against the pole, only giving them a
transitory view of her shapely backside.  An almost casual kick of her leg sent
the discarded overalls flying through the air to impact the wall behind the
jukebox.  She then brought her leg forward, very slowly sliding the inside of
her calf and thigh along to pole until it rested against her sheath.
     &quot;This is how it should have been that night,&quot; she whispered very softly,
taking her time in wrapping her leg around the pole, &quot;The night that never
happened.  Just him and me, alone in the hayloft together.... with nothing
between us but the warmth of our friendship.... and the warmth of our feelings
for each other.  Old, familiar feelings.... and the new, strange, frightening
and yet exciting feelings....&quot;
     Tolaris simply let his breath out as the redhead began a slow rotation
around the pole, giving the audience a full view of her back and sides in an
openly sensual manner.  &quot;You could have said something,&quot; he murmured, unable to
stop himself from studying the curves and details of her nude body.
     T&#39;Del continued to spin around the pole before coming to a halt facing the
audience, her head tilted to one side to peer around the brass pole and her
groin still carefully hidden from view.  &quot;I would have crossed the line with
him,&quot; she confessed softly as a delicate blush tinted her cheeks.  &quot;I would
have yielded to him.... to that wonderful, gentle, tender touch.... here,&quot; she
purred as she turned to the side to cast her body in profile again, reaching up
to run her hand along the side of her neck.
     &quot;And here....&quot; she whispered as her hand moved downward, deliberately
sliding across the softness of her breast and the hardened point of her nipple
before continuing lower.  &quot;Oh, how I shiver to think about it, being bared to
both his gaze and his tender touch, tasting his soft lips on my own in a kiss
that warms my very soul as he continues to explore me....  Shocking, daring,
frightening, burning, needing his touch where none had touched me before, not
in that way, never in that way before....&quot;
     The air in the bar seemed to turn deathly still again as T&#39;Del leaned back
against the dancing pole, her right leg arched forward just slightly to keep
her sheath hidden from the eyes of the audience.  Very slowly she relaxed the
muscles of her thigh, allowing her leg to slip back at a measured pace even as
her hand slid down over the smooth lines of her stomach.  Her hand swept over
her groin muscles just as her leg moved, revealing only an instant&#39;s glimpse of
the smoothness of her hairless sheath before it was hidden from view again.
     &quot;To be honest,&quot; T&#39;Del murmured in a somewhat husky tone, her eyes still
closed as she slowly arched her back forward, &quot;This is another moment where not
even I can imagine how it would have happened, or how I would have responded.
All I know is that he would have been as gentle as a feather, fearful of how I
would react to his touch.  Oh, how I wish there were words to explain this, or
words to tell him that he didn&#39;t need to fear me.... to fear the power of the
woman he would soon make me....&quot;
     A gentle smile crossed T&#39;Del&#39;s face as she opened her eyes and turned her
head to look at the audience, fully aware of the provocative pose her nude body
was in at the moment.  She reached up with her free hand to cross her chest,
resting her palm on her breast as her other hand made an exaggerated wiggling
motion over her groin.  &quot;But alas, my friends, that is a different story and
one I am not yet ready to tell.  But now you know how it is, the truth of that
night, the night that never happened.... and the fantasy of how it should have
happened.  Sleep well and pleasant dreams tonight,&quot; she breathed as she stood
up straight and bowed her head briefly, giving them a full and unrestricted
view of her entire body.
     There seemed to be a collective intake of breath as the audience realized
that the performance was over, quickly followed by what could only be described
as a controlled riot as the hoots and shouts of approval started in earnest.
T&#39;Del held her pose for a few moments before straightening up with a soft smile
on her face, tilting her chin just enough to cast a knowing look squarely at
the booth in the corner before turning around and calmly walking off the stage.
     &quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi,&quot; Si&#39;ren murmured as she slowly let her breath out.  &quot;Now
that was a performance.  Tell me again what you....&quot; she started to say to
Azi&#39;mar before she saw the look on Tolaris&#39; face.
     &quot;Yes, that certainly was,&quot; Tolaris said, visibly struggling to breathe.
He seemed to wince as he tried to take in a deep breath, rubbing his ribcage
gently before letting his breath back out with a ragged sound.
     &quot;Commander?&quot; Si&#39;ren said in an openly uneasy tone.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
     &quot;I wish I knew,&quot; Tolaris replied, giving her an apologetic look.  &quot;Just
give me a few moments, I should be fine.&quot;
     K&#39;tal cast a sidelong glance at him before looking at the table in the
hopes of finding something to drink.  &quot;Well, I&#39;m not a Healer or anything, but
I&#39;d start with turning off the electricity first,&quot; he said in a pointed tone.
     Tolaris blinked and glanced down at his hand, able to catch a glimpse of
a tiny spark of lightning as it arced between his fingertips.  &quot;Strange,&quot; he
said as he turned his focus inward, getting a firmer grip on his Chaos Factor
powers.  Much to his surprise, the sharp stabbing pains in his ribs seemed to
ease considerably a few moments later.
     &quot;Enjoyed it that much, eh?&quot; K&#39;tal smirked as he cast a glance towards the
bar to see if he could flag down B&#39;nai.
     &quot;I thought I told you to settle down,&quot; Si&#39;ren said to him in an edged tone
before returning her focus to Tolaris.  &quot;So let me get this right.  That was
you she was talking about?&quot; she inquired, giving him a genuinely curious look.
     Tolaris visibly paused as he regarded the white-haired admiral carefully.
&quot;As I said, T&#39;Del and I are.... old friends.  And with all due respect, Si&#39;ren,
the subject of whatever transpired my childhood is not open for discussion,&quot; he
added in a neutral tone.
     &quot;As you wish, Tolaris,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied calmly as she went to take a sip of
her drink, only to discover that the glass was empty.  &quot;Mmm, interesting,&quot; she
mused to herself.  &quot;I haven&#39;t been distracted like that in centuries.  To be
honest, Azi&#39;mar, I think that performance makes up for being asked to fly out
here on such short notice.  I&#39;m still a touch upset about the dress-code aspect
of this place, however,&quot; she added, giving Azi&#39;mar a faintly reproving look.
     &quot;If it means anything, you look absolutely stunning in that dress,&quot; K&#39;tal
offered as he gave her an appraising look.
     &quot;I suppose I should be flattered,&quot; Si&#39;ren admitted with a half-shrug.  She
paused as Azi&#39;mar reached out to pick up her hand, leaning forward to briefly
kiss it.
     &quot;You should be flattered, Si&#39;ren,&quot; he assured her.
     &quot;And why&#39;s that?&quot; she asked in a guarded tone, keenly aware of the fact
that he was still holding her hand and that Tolaris&#39; eyebrow was arched up.
     &quot;Because it&#39;s true, you do look stunning in that gown,&quot; he replied as he
kissed her hand a second time.  &quot;And before you ask, yes I did have ulterior
motives in asking you join me this evening.  Aside from needing to converse on
a number of important subjects,&quot; he added almost as an afterthought as he made
a gesture to the Dragoons with his chin.
     Si&#39;ren simply raised a delicate white eyebrow.  &quot;I do appreciate your
honesty, if nothing else,&quot; she pointed out in a somewhat dry tone.
     K&#39;tal sighed quietly to himself before making a slight coughing noise.
&quot;Not to be a wet blanket or anything, but I don&#39;t suppose we have time to iron
out a plan for who will be doing what in the immediate future while we&#39;re all
still here and talking to one another like civilized adults?&quot;
     &quot;Try this,&quot; Tolaris spoke up before anyone could react.  He paused for a
moment to make sure he had everyone&#39;s attention before picking up his empty
glass, making a show of trying to drink from it.  &quot;When I get the chance, I&#39;ll
have a word with Darian about arranging a meeting on a number of topics, one of
which being his willingness to stand in judgment at a trial.  I&#39;ll have to run
this past a magistrate as well, of course, but I can&#39;t say that I foresee any
real conflicts with the law at this point.  I&#39;ll also coordinate things with
Serena and the others so there won&#39;t be any surprises.&quot;  He paused again to
shake the empty glass upside-down on the table before setting it back down.
&quot;Until you hear from me, I would very strongly suggest you don&#39;t try anything
else that would upset the Sailor Scouts.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren gave Tolaris a measured look before she tugged her hand free from
Azi&#39;mar&#39;s grasp and leaned back.  &quot;I suppose that&#39;s acceptable,&quot; she mused.
&quot;And in regards to the Dragoon Legion?&quot; she added, giving K&#39;tal a wary look.
     K&#39;tal frowned slightly.  &quot;As far as I know, we are simply awaiting new
orders,&quot; he said in a very guarded tone.  &quot;Granted we&#39;re still ptanka-first in
the terrain with liquefied sand clogging our intakes, but that&#39;s expected to be
resolved in a few days.  I really must commend Sector Seven for their efforts,
by the way, as they have been most helpful in decontaminating our hull.&quot;
     &quot;Mmmm,&quot; Si&#39;ren grunted quietly as she tried not to think about yesterday&#39;s
nuclear incident.  &quot;I&#39;ll try to make a note of it when I get back.&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;ll send up an official statement,&quot; Tolaris promised her.
     &quot;Do that,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied with a nod of her head.  She blinked as a glass
of water was plunked down in front of her, looking up to find B&#39;nai at the end
of the table again with a tray full of assorted drinks.
     &quot;You people need to learn how to relax,&quot; the bar-mistress groused as the
entire table seemed to jump slightly at her silent approach.  &quot;Here,&quot; she added
curtly as she set a second glass of water down in front of K&#39;tal.
     &quot;Surely you are a savoir in the dim twilight,&quot; K&#39;tal purred at her as he
picked up the glass and promptly downed half of it.
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; B&#39;nai sighed with a roll of her eyes as she handed out glasses
of water to both Tolaris and Azi&#39;mar.  &quot;I take it you want the room tonight?&quot;
she asked her father in an openly wary tone.
     &quot;Unless one of your lounge ladies needs to rent it for business purposes,&quot;
Azi&#39;mar replied casually, almost causing K&#39;tal to choke on his ice water.
     B&#39;nai gave him a glare that was pure steel before reaching up to grab the
small box-like device hanging from her belt.  Her thumb seemed to dance across
the surface for a brief moment before it started to hum quietly to itself.  A
slender key-card was spat out the bottom a few seconds later, neatly landing in
the palm of her hand.  &quot;Try not to snore too loudly tonight, I&#39;ve got a guest
in the next room over,&quot; she growled as she tossed the card on the table.
     &quot;Thank you,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said as he took a measured sip of his water, seeming
to be unfazed by her attitude.
     The bar-mistress snorted quietly to herself and turned to look at Tolaris
with a very critical eye.  &quot;I don&#39;t know who you are,&quot; she said in a dangerous
tone as she activated the key-printer again, &quot;But I am only going to say this
once: Behave or they&#39;ll find your head in the toilet outside.  Both of them,&quot;
she added darkly as the printer spat out a second key which was promptly tossed
in front of the elder Dragoon.
     Tolaris blinked and glanced down at the key-card before looking up at her.
&quot;I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but I&#39;m not asking....&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid,&quot; B&#39;nai interrupted him, giving him a very level look.
     Tolaris studied her expression very carefully for a number of moments
before nodding slowly.  &quot;Very well then,&quot; he said as he reached to pick up the
key-card.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;
     K&#39;tal cast a side-long glance at Tolaris before turning his attention to
B&#39;nai.  &quot;Not to make a mockery of the level of hospitality being shown here,&quot;
he said in a very carefully-crafted tone, &quot;But we thumbed a ride here with some
friends from Sector Seven and we&#39;re not exactly in a position to drive back to
pick him up in the morning.&quot;
     B&#39;nai simply jerked her chin over her shoulder.  &quot;Glitter already asked me
about room arrangements,&quot; she retorted.  &quot;She said something about not being
able to repair the fuel injector until the morning, so unless you want to be a
tumbleweed on the Desert Express you&#39;re not going anywhere tonight.&quot;
     &quot;Charming,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he sat back with a faintly sour expression.
     &quot;You&#39;ll survive,&quot; B&#39;nai smirked as she manipulated the key-printer again.
She waited until it spat out the key before tossing it on the table in front of
him.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to negotiate your own deal with G&#39;Lan, but she&#39;ll keep you
out of trouble for the night.&quot;
     K&#39;tal blinked hard and regarded the key-card warily as if it had suddenly
become poisonous.  &quot;Right,&quot; he said slowly, casting a brief look at Tolaris and
getting a casual shrug in response.  &quot;Thanks.... I think.&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;ve never spent the night with a woman before,&quot; B&#39;nai
sneered as she collected the empty glasses and bottles.
     &quot;K&#39;tal?&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up as the Dragoon opened his mouth.  &quot;Spare us.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; he replied with a sigh, suddenly flinching as B&#39;nai grabbed
the back of his head in an iron grip.  &quot;Hey, hey, easy ne&#39;ana, I just had that
trimmed last week....&quot; he protested in a pained tone.
     &quot;Someone obviously needs an object lesson in etiquette in my bar,&quot; she
hissed softly in a glacial tone.
     &quot;Your room or mine?&quot; K&#39;tal replied without thinking.
     &quot;B&#39;nai!&quot; Azi&#39;mar said sharply as the bar-mistress moved to slam his head
against the surface of the table.
     Si&#39;ren just shook her head to herself in mild disbelief.  &quot;And to think
we have someone like him running a division,&quot; she commented to the table.
     &quot;Hey, blame him for leaving,&quot; K&#39;tal retorted as he gestured to Tolaris,
still keeping most of his focus on B&#39;nai&#39;s painful grip on his hair.  &quot;Then
Shar-Tei would still be both alive and the XO, and my sorry ptanka would still
be studying for the LC screening board.  Ne&#39;ana, you&#39;re cute as hell and all,
but you&#39;re going to have to let go real soon before I get excited....&quot;
     &quot;I think you&#39;re excited enough as it is,&quot; Si&#39;ren pointed out dryly.
     &quot;Move,&quot; Tolaris grunted as he elbowed K&#39;tal.  He waited patiently as B&#39;nai
let go of K&#39;tal and took a step back, allowing the younger Dragoon to slide out
of the booth to let Tolaris exit.  &quot;Thank you.  Which way to your restroom?&quot; he
added casually.
     B&#39;nai simply pointed to the dark hallway that continued past both the bar
and the staircase.  &quot;Third door on the right past the bar,&quot; she said crisply,
still giving K&#39;tal the proverbial evil-eye.  She paused to cast a glance at
Tolaris&#39; back as he moved past her before snorting quietly.  &quot;And people wonder
why I can&#39;t stand you military types in my bar,&quot; she growled as she hefted her
serving tray and started to move away.  She froze in place as K&#39;tal reached out
to gently snag her wrist, turning her head to glare at him yet again.
     &quot;Word of advice, ne&#39;ana?&quot; K&#39;tal said, giving her a perfectly serious look.
&quot;Don&#39;t try to use me as a model-brush to paint the entire military with.  Yes,
I&#39;m what they consider off-the-wall most of the time and have more than a few
marks on my record for inappropriate behavior at meetings, but one lone Dragoon
doesn&#39;t qualify as the military.  Tolaris is a straight-shooter,&quot; he said with
a nod towards the distant hallway where Tolaris had gone.  &quot;Si&#39;ren here is Navy
so she&#39;s in another category entirely, but she&#39;s still good people.  And as for
our one-eyed wonder here.... I think you know deep down that he&#39;s not the iron-
fisted tyrant you seem to have the occasional waking nightmare about.&quot;
     B&#39;nai yanked her hand free from his with a sharp snarl.  &quot;What makes you
think I care, Dragoon?&quot; she hissed, her face a mask of barely-contained anger.
     &quot;I know you don&#39;t,&quot; K&#39;tal replied calmly.  &quot;But think about this for a few
moments.... if you don&#39;t care about us, why should we care about you?  Oh, and
before you say it?&quot; he added as her eyes narrowed even further.  &quot;You and I
just met today, so keep in mind who didn&#39;t care about whom first.&quot;
     The bar-mistress simply snorted in contempt and turned away, heading back
to the bar with the dirty glasses.  K&#39;tal watched her for a moment before he
sat back down with a soft sigh, casting a rueful look at his half-empty glass
of water.  &quot;That probably could have gone better,&quot; he admitted to both Si&#39;ren
and Azi&#39;mar.
     &quot;Part of me idly wondered why an officer like you was single,&quot; Si&#39;ren said
casually as she took another sip of her water.  &quot;Now I know why.&quot;
     The Dragoon paused in mid-drink and looked back up at her.  &quot;Is there any
particular way I should take that?&quot; he inquired in a very cautious tone.
     &quot;Face-value,&quot; Si&#39;ren assured him in a tone as dry as the desert sands.
     &quot;Just checking,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a casual shrug.  &quot;You&#39;re awful quiet,&quot;
he added as he glanced over at Azi&#39;mar.
     Azi&#39;mar merely grunted quietly to himself.  &quot;I have a lot on my mind,&quot; he
pointed out as he too reached for his glass of ice water.
     &quot;Anything you&#39;d like to share?&quot; K&#39;tal prompted.  &quot;Or is this where I take
my leave and let you hit on Si&#39;ren in private?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren just shook her head.  &quot;Be glad I left my duty sidearm back in the
cruiser,&quot; she said in an openly resigned tone.
     &quot;Mind if I think aloud for a moment?&quot; K&#39;tal inquired casually, making a
show of finishing off his glass of water.  He waited several moments to make
sure there wasn&#39;t going to be any overt objection before setting the glass down
and taking a deep breath.  &quot;You know, if you do spend the night with him, that
will be sufficient grounds to recuse yourself from any sort of tribunal, which
will of course delay the matter even further,&quot; he said in a muted tone as he
studied the ice cubes in his glass.
     &quot;K&#39;tal....&quot; Azi&#39;mar started to say.
     &quot;It&#39;s just a thought,&quot; K&#39;tal interrupted with an exaggerated shrug, still
keeping his gaze on the ice cubes.  &quot;I mean, we&#39;re all adults here, aren&#39;t we?
Even if you don&#39;t and just say you did, that should be sufficient.  And without
a sufficient panel available to sit in judgment, the worst that could happen is
you get put under house-arrest until such a panel can be formed.  Well, I think
Rune can have you tossed in a military prison facility to await trial, but odds
are a distinguished and senior officer such as yourself will not be subjected
to such an indignity.  Not quite a vacation scenario, mind you, but I doubt
you&#39;d be seeing the wrong end of a chopping block anytime soon.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar and Si&#39;ren exchanged wary glances in silence for several seconds
before they turned back to look at K&#39;tal.  &quot;I suppose I should be grateful for
such a suggestion,&quot; Azi&#39;mar said in a neutral tone.
     K&#39;tal simply waved his hand and picked up his glass, draining out the few
drops of water that had melted from the ice cubes.  &quot;Like I said,&quot; he mused as
he set the glass back down, &quot;We&#39;re all adults here and division officers to
boot, so it&#39;s not like I have any reason to play the dagger-in-the-back game
with either of you.  Learn to trust me, alright?&quot; he said, more to Si&#39;ren than
to Azi&#39;mar as he scooped up the key-card in front of him and started to scoot
out of the booth.
     &quot;Can I trust you, K&#39;tal?&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up, giving him a measured look as
she drained the rest of the water from her glass.
     K&#39;tal returned the look for a number of moments before leaning over to put
his lips near her ear.  &quot;If you truly have to ask that, Admiral,&quot; he said in a
very soft voice that only she could hear, &quot;Then I think you have more troubles
than you had thought.  Fair evening to the both of you,&quot; he added in a normal
tone as he glanced up at Azi&#39;mar.
     &quot;Fair evening, K&#39;tal,&quot; Azi&#39;mar rumbled quietly as he watched the Dragoon
thread his way among the chairs and tables to approach the bar.  &quot;He really
doesn&#39;t know when to quit, does he?&quot; he said in open amusement as he saw K&#39;tal
trying to talk to B&#39;nai again.
     &quot;Tenacity has its uses in a person,&quot; Si&#39;ren spoke up as she absently let
her gaze roam around the table.  Her eyes fell on the key-card B&#39;nai had given
him earlier, sending just the faintest of shivers through her veins as she
thought about her conversation with Zan&#39;zemet earlier in the day.  &quot;While I&#39;m
not naive enough to think he&#39;s utterly harmless, I do believe that he can be
counted on to do the right thing.&quot;
     &quot;The right thing according to whom?&quot; he inquired archly.
     &quot;One mystery at a time, Colonel,&quot; she said softly, still idly studying the
electronic etching in the plastic key-card.  Her gaze shifted upwards as his
hand moved to gently touch her chin, tilting her head to the side so that their
eyes met.
     &quot;So what other mysteries are you worried about?&quot; Azi&#39;mar inquired in what
sounded to her like an uncharacteristically soft tone.
     &quot;What to do with Rune,&quot; Si&#39;ren replied calmly.  &quot;What to do with Nop&#39;tera,
what to do with Darian, what to do with Sailor Moon, what to do with Tolaris
and the Dragoons.... and what to do with you,&quot; she added in a faintly arched
tone.  &quot;Zan&#39;zemet warned me about you earlier, you know.&quot;
     &quot;Oh?&quot; he said, arching up the eyebrow over his distinctive eye-patch.
&quot;And do I dare I ask what she said about me?&quot;
     The faintest snorts of amusement rose up from her chest as she studied the
tiny wrinkles around the edges of his eye-patch.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that she&#39;s a
bit envious of my being asked to join you for an after-dinner drink.&quot;
     It was Azi&#39;mar&#39;s turn to snort quietly in idle amusement as he lowered his
hand and leaned back against the padded booth.  &quot;Not to speak ill of her, but
your informal life-mate needs to get out more.  Oh, your relationship is not as
quiet as you think,&quot; he added as Si&#39;ren promptly blinked hard.  &quot;Quite a few
people know about your relationship, though I have to say it&#39;s one of the most
discreet ones I&#39;ve encountered.  And you know what, Si&#39;ren?  Nobody seems to
really care, either, so relax.&quot;
     &quot;Hmmph,&quot; Si&#39;ren grunted as she looked away, feeling her cheeks tint just
slightly with shame.  She cast a sidelong glance back at him as she felt his
fingertip lightly make contact with her chin again.  &quot;You&#39;re awfully bold for
someone facing potential execution,&quot; she pointed out in a faintly cool tone.
&quot;Or are you always this touchy with women?&quot;
     &quot;Consider my situation,&quot; he replied calmly, gently putting pressure on her
chin until she turned around to look at him.  &quot;If I&#39;m already a walking corpse,
then what&#39;s the worst that could happen to me?  If you&#39;re not interested, all
you have to do is say good night and leave.  After all, you are a busy lady
with the entire military to run and all, correct?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren simply raised an eyebrow at him.  &quot;Well, if you&#39;re going to put it
like that....&quot; she said tersely as she started to scoot away.  She paused and
held still as he likewise moved, sliding himself forward as his hand left her
chin to take hold of her wrist in a gentle grip.
     &quot;Humor a drunk old fool for a moment,&quot; he murmured quietly in her ear, his
lips brushing against her with every syllable.  &quot;What else did Zan&#39;zemet say?&quot;
     &quot;Is that curiosity or ego asking?&quot; she inquired in a neutral tone.
     &quot;At this point?  Both,&quot; he admitted with a casual shrug.
     She sighed quietly, trying not to shiver lightly at the way his breath was
tickling the edges of her ear.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say she mentioned that you ranked
fairly high on her list of preferred customers,&quot; she summarized dryly.
     A truly sour grunt rose up from the depths of his chest as he leaned back
from her.  &quot;I&#39;ll bet she keeps a list, too,&quot; he muttered darkly as he glanced
down at the table.  He paused and glanced back up at her as she turned around
to give him a look that was both curious and guarded at the same time.
     &quot;Why, Azi&#39;mar,&quot; she said in an openly faked tone of sultry intrigue.  &quot;Is
that a note of...?&quot;
     &quot;Jealousy?&quot; he interrupted, giving her a look of amusement.  He closed his
good eye and allowed a small smile to briefly cross his face before looking up
at her once again.  &quot;We all have our character flaws, Si&#39;ren,&quot; he pointed out
in a soft tone.  &quot;For all the casual contempt I have for women who sell their
bodies for mere coin, Zan&#39;zemet strikes me as a woman who truly enjoys such a
calling in offering comfort and pleasure to others.  I&#39;m sure you know just how
good she is at what she does,&quot; he added with a note of jaded humor, causing a
delicate blush to cross her cheeks.
     &quot;Your point being...?&quot; she prompted him as calmly as she could manage.
     He simply shrugged a shoulder in casual dismissal.  &quot;In another time and
place, Si&#39;ren, she and I might have been life-mates if it wasn&#39;t for her....
life-style, I suppose you could call it,&quot; he admitted after a brief pause to
try to find the right words.  &quot;So I guess you can imagine there is more than a
little tension between us, and I don&#39;t mean the kind that can be worked out
with a warm bottle of massage oil.&quot;
     &quot;Yet you still visit her on occasion,&quot; she pointed out carefully, more
than a little surprised that the normally gruff and reserved Training colonel
was being this open and candid with her.
     &quot;Rare occasion,&quot; he corrected her with a somewhat dour sigh.  &quot;And only
for business reasons as mandated by Medical.  Let&#39;s just say she and I had a
rather.... in-depth conversation one day and came to an understanding about a
few things.&quot;
     The white-haired admiral paused for a moment, visibly digesting his words.
&quot;Don&#39;t tell me she blackmailed you?&quot; she finally ventured in a muted tone, not
entirely sure if she was reading between the lines properly.
     &quot;Hardly,&quot; he replied, giving her an unamused look.  &quot;We simply made a
deal: I wouldn&#39;t argue with her medical staff when they said it was necessary
for me to visit the main Hospitality annex at the Imperial Castle, and her non-
civilian personnel would do their part to properly comply with the mandated
physical fitness requirements set forth by Training that every other military
division has to meet on an annual basis.&quot;
     &quot;Ah,&quot; Si&#39;ren said quietly as the last piece fell into place in the back of
her mind to solve a century-old puzzle.  So that explains it, she mused as she
briefly thought about why the aging Hospitality Brigadier tended to go on a
minor, if grouchy, fitness binge at certain times of the year.  &quot;So why me?&quot;
she said suddenly as she looked back up at him, refocusing on the situation at
hand.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; he murmured, seeming to be caught off-guard by the question.
     &quot;So what does your checkered past with Zan&#39;zemet have to do with your
seemingly casual interest in me?&quot; she prodded as she edged away from him just
slightly.
     &quot;You interest me for two reasons, though I suppose it should be three,&quot; he
confessed with a faint hint of a smile.  &quot;First of all, let&#39;s be honest here,
you&#39;re hardly a strain on the eyes in terms of physical beauty, and showing an
interest in a younger woman at my age could be considered cradle-robbing.&quot;
     &quot;Uh huh,&quot; she said, giving him a slightly unsettled look.
     &quot;That was meant as a compliment,&quot; he groused as he reached up to take her
hand in his, leaning forward to lightly kiss her knuckles.
     &quot;Go on,&quot; she prodded, casting a momentary glance down at her hand.
     &quot;The second reason, and the one that ties in with Zan&#39;zemet, is that she
likewise is interested in you, but in far more than a casual way.  Trust me,&quot;
he added as she blinked in surprise, &quot;With as much personal attention as she
gets, there has to be something truly special about a person to draw her focus
like that.  And more so if it&#39;s another woman,&quot; he added meaningfully.
     &quot;O.... kay,&quot; Si&#39;ren said slowly, still giving him a dubious look.  &quot;I&#39;m
sure that&#39;s supposed to be a compliment as well, but I guess I&#39;m not really
seeing it in the proper light.  Should I bother asking what your third reason
is, or should I just let it rest?&quot;
     A wry chuckle rose up from Azi&#39;mar&#39;s chest as he regarded her carefully.
&quot;I suppose you could call it ego,&quot; he confessed.  &quot;I&#39;ve never shared the bed
with an admiral before.&quot;
     &quot;Nor will you at this rate,&quot; she pointed out with a faint note of humor.
     &quot;So much for simple charisma,&quot; he replied with a truly dry chuckle, giving
her hand a gentle squeeze before running his thumb along the edge of hers.  &quot;I
don&#39;t suppose I could entice you in a more direct fashion, then?&quot;
     Si&#39;ren raised a delicate white eyebrow.  &quot;I&#39;m listening.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s strange how the Chaos Factor works sometimes,&quot; he mused, still very
lightly caressing her hand.  &quot;When used on one woman it will almost literally
knock her socks off, when used on another she barely feels anything.  I&#39;m not
sure if it&#39;s solely me or solely her or something in between.  I just know it
feels like a roll of the dice.  Feeling lucky, Si&#39;ren?&quot; he added as he looked
up at her, staring into her eyes with an unusual intensity.
     &quot;Depends on the stakes and how the game is played,&quot; she said neutrally.
&quot;If that&#39;s your way of asking me if I&#39;ll sleep with you....&quot;
     Her words were suddenly cut off as he leaned forward, just enough to bring
his lips into contact with hers.  She wasn&#39;t precisely sure what happened in
the following moments, only aware of having to blindly grab onto the nearest
solid object with her free hand as a truly dizzying electric sensation flowed
through her entire body.  The kiss was broken several moments later as he sat
back, not able to feel anything on his own and carefully studying her for a
reaction.
     &quot;Si&#39;ren?&quot; he prodded carefully after she remained seemingly frozen in
place for several moments.  He raised an eyebrow as she slowly opened her eyes,
revealing a pair of dangerously wide irises that seemed to have a hard time
focusing on the table in front of her.
     &quot;That.... was unique,&quot; she breathed once she was absolutely sure she could
both see and think clearly again.  She blinked several times and shook her head
before looking back up at him, very slowly letting her breath out.  &quot;With a
power like that available to you, I&#39;m surprised this is the first I&#39;ve even
heard of it.&quot;
     &quot;What can I say,&quot; he replied with a slight shrug, &quot;I try not to abuse it.
Scale of one to ten, Si&#39;ren, how&#39;d that feel?&quot;
     &quot;Tempting,&quot; she admitted as she looked down at her hands.  She blinked as
she discovered she was gripping the booth padding almost hard enough to tear
the material, very gingerly releasing her hold on it and taking in a measured
breath.  &quot;Hmm?&quot; she inquired as she heard a very soft grunt somewhere deep in
his chest.
     &quot;Nothing, really,&quot; he said, casting an absent glance around the table to
see if he had overlooked anything worth drinking.  &quot;I was hoping I would be
able to appeal to you without having to rely on that.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren said nothing for several seconds as she studied him carefully, her
hand still gently held by his.  &quot;In another time and place, Azi&#39;mar, or even
simply at another time, this wouldn&#39;t be much of a problem at all,&quot; she said in
a careful tone.  &quot;However, all kidding aside, I&#39;m not sure I really do have the
time for something like this.&quot;
     Azi&#39;mar simply made a gesture with his free hand.  &quot;You do have your comm-
link with you, correct?  Important decisions can still be made if they need to
be made.&quot;
     The Fleet Admiral visibly mulled over his words.  &quot;My pilot is not going
to be happy if I&#39;m delayed much longer,&quot; she hedged.  &quot;Granted I told her that
I didn&#39;t know how long this meeting would take, but....&quot;
     A faint smile crossed his face as he leaned forward.  &quot;So do what I do,&quot;
he murmured quietly as he gently nuzzled her ear.  &quot;Buy them a bottle to drink
when they get back and go off-duty.  And don&#39;t try to tell me the Navy isn&#39;t in
the practice of soothing rough edges at sea with distilled spirits, we both
know better than that.&quot;
     Si&#39;ren sighed quietly as his lips lightly teased her ear.  &quot;Just so we
understand one another,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Why are we doing this again?&quot;
     &quot;For our own reasons, Si&#39;ren,&quot; he replied quietly.  &quot;In my case, I want to
enjoy your intimate company.  It doesn&#39;t matter to me why you want to, so long
as you do so of your own free will.  And to be perfectly honest, I&#39;d prefer it
if one of your reasons wasn&#39;t for K&#39;tal&#39;s proposed conflict of interest.&quot;
     &quot;Very well,&quot; she murmured as she twisted her head around, allowing her to
gently kiss him.  It seemed that whatever power he had used on her earlier was
under his control, as it was several seconds before she was rewarded with the
sudden full-body tingle that she had experienced earlier.
     &quot;You alright?&quot; he asked when their lips parted after a minor eternity,
neither fully aware of how much time had actually elapsed.
     &quot;Ask me later,&quot; she replied as she leaned forward to kiss him again, her
free hand reaching out to pick up the electronic key-card from the table.  &quot;My
head is spinning all of a sudden, so it&#39;s a little difficult to tell.  Well, I
shouldn&#39;t say all of a sudden,&quot; she added as she scooted out of the booth and
took a few steps back.  &quot;I guess you can say I&#39;ve been in a bit of a tizzy
since yesterday.  Nuclear headaches tend to linger like that,&quot; she sighed.
     &quot;This is where K&#39;tal would crack a joke about women and headaches, no
doubt,&quot; he observed dryly as he likewise scooted out of the booth and stood up
straight.  &quot;And speaking of headaches, he&#39;s going to develop one of his own if
he doesn&#39;t leave B&#39;nai alone,&quot; he added as he glanced over at the bar again.
     Si&#39;ren merely shrugged.  &quot;I&#39;m sure he can manage his own problems,&quot; she
said in dismissal as they began to move towards the staircase.  &quot;Or are you
having protective paternal feelings for your daughter all of a sudden?&quot; she
added as the thought hit her, causing her to pause and glance back at him.  She
promptly blinked at the subtle smile on his face and apparent gleam in his one
good eye.
     &quot;Trust me, Si&#39;ren,&quot; he said quietly as he lightly took hold of her elbow
and guided her towards the stairs.  &quot;There&#39;s a reason I asked for K&#39;tal to be
included in this little get-together, and it wasn&#39;t because he&#39;s supposedly in
charge of the Dragoon Legion at this point.&quot;
     &quot;Really, now....&quot; she said slowly, casting the briefest of glances back at
the bar before she moved past it.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure who I need to feel sorry for,
K&#39;tal or B&#39;nai.&quot;
     &quot;One mystery at a time, Admiral,&quot; he purred softly in her ear as they
began a casual ascent of the stairs.

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;K&#39;tal?&quot; Tolaris said in a weary tone as he emerged from the restroom to
find the other Dragoon sitting at one end of the bar.  B&#39;nai was busy at the
other end of the bar, seeming to be actively ignoring him as she mixed up a
series of vibrant-colored drinks for various patrons.
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; K&#39;tal replied, absently drumming the edge of the key-card against
the polished surface of the bar.
     &quot;You really should give it a rest,&quot; Tolaris advised as he cast a casual
glance around the tavern.  Octane was still pretty easy to spot given the way
her back tentacles stuck out in contrast to the rest of her surroundings.
     K&#39;tal shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;Trust me, I know what I&#39;m doing.  She&#39;s a
little busy at the moment, which makes sense now that the show is over, but I
expect we&#39;ll have ourselves a little conversation in short order.  Should I ask
about your room assignment for the evening?&quot; he added, casting a brief glance
at the key-card Tolaris carried in one hand.
     &quot;Much like most of our evening so far, probably yet another blind surprise
that won&#39;t be too difficult to endure,&quot; he said in a completely neutral tone,
prompting a quiet grunt from the other Dragoon.
     &quot;What scares me is I think I know what you mean,&quot; K&#39;tal grumbled.
     &quot;So what are you going to do?&quot; Tolaris prodded cautiously, already having
a fair idea of what the answer would be.
     K&#39;tal made a gesture with the key-card.  &quot;Oh, me?  I&#39;m going to see if I
can&#39;t weasel a bit of an accommodation upgrade out of our lovely hostess.  And
if that doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll probably hunt down Glitter and ask her if she feels
like....&quot;
     &quot;K&#39;tal!&quot; Tolaris said, his eyes widening slightly.
     K&#39;tal turned to give him a fairly moderate glare.  &quot;Letting me borrow the
keys to her transport so I can crash in one of the seats,&quot; he finished in a
faintly glacial tone.  &quot;Read too deeply into things much?&quot;
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; Tolaris apolgized with a soft sigh as he realized that he had
jumped to the wrong conclusion.
     &quot;You need to relax,&quot; K&#39;tal observed.  &quot;Try letting your hair down a bit,
I won&#39;t say anything if it&#39;s longer than the regs permit.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s not as easy as you think,&quot; Tolaris grumbled, ignoring the comment
about his longer-than-collar-length hair.  &quot;We&#39;ve run into how many traps since
we left the Imperial Castle?&quot;
     K&#39;tal simply made a dismissive gesture with his free hand.  &quot;You get used
to being ambushed at random, or so the kids in Field Operations keep trying to
tell me.  You&#39;re a Mintaka veteran, you should know this.&quot;
     A faint twinge promptly took up residence in Tolaris&#39; gut at the mention
of the campaign.  &quot;Yes, and it&#39;s because I was so uptight all the time that I
was able to survive life in the field,&quot; he pointed out darkly.
     &quot;Settle down, boss,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he slumped against the bar.  &quot;Maybe
you should be making use of this,&quot; he added with a gesture of his key-card.
&quot;A night on the wild side might improve your disposition.&quot;
     Tolaris cast a reflexive glance down at K&#39;tal&#39;s key-card and thought about
what B&#39;nai had said earlier.  &quot;Does Ael&#39;ien know what you&#39;re up to?&quot; he asked
carefully.
     &quot;She will soon enough,&quot; K&#39;tal growled, causing Tolaris to blink at the
darkness in his tone.
     &quot;Oh?&quot; Tolaris said, sensing a landmine ahead.  &quot;I thought the two of you
were on good terms as of late.&quot;
     The other Dragoon simply shrugged.  &quot;Well, I thought so too, up until I
learned that what I told her in confidence was promptly repeated into our dear
friend Si&#39;ren&#39;s ear.&quot;
     An icy chill started to thread through Tolaris&#39; veins as he reviewed his
memories of the conversation back in the booth.  &quot;You mean in regards to trying
to meet with Serena,&quot; he said as the realization sank in.
     &quot;What can I say, I don&#39;t appreciate being used,&quot; K&#39;tal growled quietly.
     Tolaris raised an eyebrow.  &quot;And doing something stupid is going to make
the situation any better?&quot; he prodded.  &quot;Not to pry into your personal business
or anything, but women as a species tend to take very dim and unforgiving views
of deliberate....&quot;
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; K&#39;tal said in an openly weary tone, turning to give him a tired
look.  &quot;I think the proper human phrase is &#39;get bent&#39;.  And if that&#39;s not it,
tell me you at least get the general idea.&quot;
     The elder Dragoon simply shrugged in reply.  &quot;See you in the morning,&quot; he
said as he turned away and warily made his way towards the stairs.
     &quot;Let&#39;s hope, eh?&quot; K&#39;tal muttered to himself as he glanced down at the far
end of the bar.  &quot;Come on, ne&#39;ana, work with me here,&quot; he added quietly as the
bar-mistress showed no signs of coming over to talk to him anytime soon.
     So the Red Wings wanted to talk earlier, he thought as he turned his focus
inward to review the group conversations.  Or at least General Ar&#39;kanis does.
Interesting, there may be a relatively painless way out of this mess yet.  And
if it&#39;s proven that Rune didn&#39;t deliberately nuke Nop&#39;tera&#39;s carrier out on the
front lawn, that might also help the situation but probably not by enough to
tip the scales.  Still, if the Red Wings are talking, it&#39;s a hell of a lot
better than fighting.
     Good ol&#39; Prince Darian, he added as he sighed quietly to himself.  Not to
speak ill of Queen Beryl, deserved or not, but what the hell was she thinking?
He&#39;s how old again?  And with what sort of experience to help run a planet?
Okay, so maybe being an Earth prince counts for something, but I doubt he&#39;s got
any recent hands-on experience keeping the throne warm.  Unless it was with
Queen Beryl earlier, let&#39;s not think about that.  Yeech, too late....
     Anyway, he thought as he physically shook his head to clear the cobwebs.
And what&#39;s a prince without his princess?  Crown Princess Serena, half-human
and the daughter of Captain Raijen.  If Darian&#39;s situation is going to be going
to hell in short order, I absolutely feel sorry for what hers is going to be
like as well.  Okay, the meeting has to happen one way or another, and our dear
friends at the Imperial Castle know this.  Hmm, can&#39;t forget that trip over to
Ka&#39;an-Nul at some point.  Why there, who knows, but if that&#39;s what they want in
exchange for coming to our meeting, we can definitely arrange a guided tour.
Do we really want to bother Commander D&#39;ael for this, however?  Poor guy was
almost a basket case when he resigned.  Not nearly as bad as Obelisk, mind you,
but she had Mintaka to deal with and that gave *everybody* gas cramps....
     K&#39;tal snapped out of his musing as a glass was plunked down in front of
him.  He blinked hard and focused on it for a moment, realizing that it was
another s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue.  Fighting the impulse to sigh heavily, he glanced up
to find a pair of stormy gray eyes giving him a distinctly guarded look.
     &quot;You&#39;re taking up space on my bar,&quot; B&#39;nai pointed out in a dark tone.
     &quot;I figured customers were allowed to sit here,&quot; K&#39;tal replied casually as
he gazed back at her.  &quot;You trying to get me drunk for a reason, or is this
simply a reflex?&quot; he added with a gesture of his chin to the mixed drink.
     B&#39;nai snorted quietly in response.  &quot;You looked like you needed something
to keep you busy now that your friends all went upstairs.  Or do you not know
how to use a key-card to unlock a door?&quot; she added with a faint sneer.
     &quot;Funny you should mention that,&quot; K&#39;tal replied lightly as he tossed the
plastic key-card on the bar in front of her.  &quot;Thanks, ne&#39;ana, but I&#39;ll not be
needing this tonight.&quot;
     B&#39;nai&#39;s eyebrows promptly arched clear up to her hairline.  &quot;Don&#39;t tell me
you&#39;re finished already,&quot; she said, giving him a look that seemed to be at
least partly serious.  &quot;I know you military types strive for efficiency in your
work and all, but this has to be a record.&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about,&quot; K&#39;tal replied in a tone as flat
as paved asphalt.  He kept his gaze on her as he reached out to pick up the
glass of blue alcohol, taking a slow drink before setting it back down with a
muted thump.  &quot;You busy?&quot;
     &quot;What does it look like to you?&quot; she growled, narrowing her eyes.
     &quot;Fair enough,&quot; he replied calmly.  &quot;So when do you get off work?&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re kidding, right?&quot; she demanded, giving him a suspicious look.
     K&#39;tal simply made a gesture with his hand.  &quot;Usually I am, ne&#39;ana, but I
assure you that at right this very moment I&#39;m perfectly serious.  So when do
you put the veil of ice aside and actually socalize with other denizens, or am
I supposed to believe you&#39;re married to your job?&quot;
     &quot;Go home, Dragoon,&quot; B&#39;nai snarled as she turned away.
     &quot;Ever make love before?&quot; K&#39;tal inquired calmly as he took another sip of
his s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue.  &quot;Nice, slow, gentle love where the point isn&#39;t sex but
rather basking in the simple joy of being with someone, free of constraints
like clothes and time and responsibilities?  I&#39;ll take that as a no,&quot; he added
as she turned back to cast a truly dark glare at him.
     &quot;What do you know of such things?&quot; she demanded in a low tone, one that
was almost impossible to overhear.  &quot;And what makes you think I care?&quot;
     &quot;I think you care,&quot; he argued quietly, lowering his tone to match hers.
&quot;One doesn&#39;t have passion in their tone like you do if you don&#39;t care.  I have
absolutely no idea what happened in your life that made you this embittered,
B&#39;nai, but for my own reasons tonight I&#39;m willing to try to give you a new
perspective on life, or at least a few new experiences to savor.  It&#39;s up to
you, of course,&quot; he added, pausing to take another measured drink, &quot;But for
what it&#39;s worth I just thought I&#39;d make you a sincere offer.&quot;
     &quot;How kind of you,&quot; she replied, almost literally dripping acid onto the
bar.  &quot;And such a noble offer you&#39;ve made, too.  I think I&#39;ll put it with all
the other &#39;offers&#39; I get from these horny bastards on a weekly basis,&quot; she
added with a sharp jerk of her chin to the crowd.  &quot;In the trash can.&quot;
     K&#39;tal remained silent for a number of moments, studying the dark look in
her storm-gray eyes and trying to wonder if he miscalculated something.  &quot;I
suppose that&#39;s fair, ne&#39;ana,&quot; he finally said in a calm tone.  &quot;No doubt that
everyone else is eager to help you with your personal problems, not that I can
blame them in the least.  You&#39;re cute as hell, after all, that tends to go for
an awful lot.  But no matter.&quot;
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; B&#39;nai snorted as she cast a brief glance over her shoulder to
see if anything else needed to be done at that end of the bar.
     &quot;One final question, if I may,&quot; K&#39;tal spoke up, causing B&#39;nai to visibly
roll her eyes before looking back at him.
     &quot;What?&quot; she demanded through clenched teeth.
     &quot;The room key you gave Tolaris,&quot; he said before taking a small sip of his
drink.  &quot;Not that it&#39;s really any of my business, but I try to look out for my
fellow Dragoons as best I can so I was wondering whose it was.  It has to be
important,&quot; he added as B&#39;nai remained silent.  &quot;After all, why else would you
threaten a guest.... excuse me, issue a pointed reminder for him to obey the
rules of decorum and protocol within your bar?&quot;
     &quot;For once, you&#39;re right,&quot; she said slowly with a protracted nod of her
head.  &quot;It isn&#39;t any of your business.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps not,&quot; K&#39;tal agreed somberly.  &quot;But stop and think about this one
for a moment.  How often do your stage-girls invite random strangers to spend
the night with them?  Wait, we might want to skip that one,&quot; he added hastily
as B&#39;nai just shook her head to herself.  &quot;Let&#39;s try it like this.... Tolaris
was invited by name, correct?&quot;
     &quot;He was,&quot; B&#39;nai replied in an openly suspicious and leery tone.
     &quot;And how many people knew he was going to be here tonight?&quot; he continued,
leaning forward to rest his elbows on the bar.  &quot;I can only think of seven:
You, me, him, Azi&#39;mar, Octane, Glitter.... and T&#39;Del.  Kinda leaves very few
options, don&#39;t you think?&quot;
     &quot;Your point?&quot; the bar-mistress demanded in a low tone.
     &quot;Just for the sake of discussion, ne&#39;ana, let&#39;s say it was T&#39;Del who asked
you for that room,&quot; K&#39;tal explained carefully.  &quot;Now I don&#39;t know T&#39;Del very
well, or at least not in a personal capacity, but she doesn&#39;s strike me as the
kind of lady to casually sleep around.  In any case, what I *do* know is that
T&#39;Del and Tolaris are good friends.  Childhood friends,&quot; he added with a very
distinct emphasis on the last two words.
     B&#39;nai blinked hard and cast a sidelong glance at the empty stage for a
number of moments, keenly aware of the unique and intense performance T&#39;Del had
given earlier.  &quot;So what?&quot; she finally said as she refocused on K&#39;tal.
     &quot;Tolaris isn&#39;t what you would call single these days, so it&#39;s not like he
would be prone to any misbehaving to begin with,&quot; the Dragoon continued.  &quot;So
imagine how things would go when he tromps on upstairs and learns he&#39;s supposed
to share a room with his childhood friend.  Again, this is all just a wild
guess here, but I&#39;m pretty sure that they won&#39;t be rumpling the sheets like so
many other &#39;guests&#39; do upstairs.  Nope, friends like that don&#39;t do such things.
So you know what they do instead?&quot;
     B&#39;nai narrowed her eyes at him for several seconds before sighing darkly
with impatience.  &quot;I have no idea, Dragoon,&quot; she growled.  &quot;Enlighten me.&quot;
     K&#39;tal simply leaned over the bar as best he could, acutely aware of the
risks he was taking by trying to get close to her.  &quot;They simply enjoy one
another&#39;s company,&quot; he whispered very softly into her ear.  &quot;That&#39;s all.  Oh,
he might hold her hand for a bit as they reminisce about past memories, she
might give him a solo performance to show him what she&#39;s been doing with her
spare time, only they know for sure.  But what I can guarantee you is that it
will remain within the bonds of friendship and respect for one another, and
that, ne&#39;ana, is the true key to everything.  Simple.... genuine.... respect,&quot;
he breathed as he tilted his head to briefly brush his lips across the side of
her neck.
     He wasn&#39;t overly surprised when she promptly grabbed him by the hair, her
iron grip keeping him largely immobile.  The part that took him by surprise,
however, was the sudden feel of something fairly cool and distinctly sharp
pressing against the base of his exposed carotid artery.
     &quot;Give me one good reason why I shouldn&#39;t kill you for that,&quot; B&#39;nai hissed
softly in a truly dangerous tone, jerking his head up to look into his eyes.
The gesture pressed his neck against her knife, threatening to break the skin
on the carefully-honed edge.
     K&#39;tal blinked and thought very quickly before taking as deep a breath as
he could without cutting himself.  &quot;Honestly, ne&#39;ana?&quot; he whispered, trying not
to let his vocal chords move too much.  &quot;The mess you&#39;d have to clean up would
probably not be worth it.  Remember,&quot; he rasped as she remained silent, &quot;I&#39;m in
charge of the Dragoons, there would be an investigation into my death, and you
know as well as I do that they&#39;d....&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t you ever shut up?&quot; B&#39;nai interrupted with a quiet sigh, giving him
a look that was somewhere between resignation and amazement.
     &quot;How about I...?&quot; K&#39;tal started to say before pausing and casting a brief
glance down at her hand.  &quot;Well, I was going to say cut you a deal, but under
the circumstances I might want to rephrase that.  You mind?&quot; he added as he
gingerly reached up with a fingertip to nudge the blade away from his throat.
     &quot;Last time, Dragoon,&quot; B&#39;nai snarled as she lowered her hand and put the
knife back under the bar.  &quot;Go away and leave me alone before I kill you,&quot; she
added as she none-too-gently shoved him back on the barstool.
     K&#39;tal briefly rubbed his throat to make sure he hadn&#39;t been cut before
picking up his forgotten drink.  &quot;So about that deal I&#39;m offering you,&quot; he said
before taking a cautious sip.
     &quot;Not interested,&quot; B&#39;nai countered flatly before turning away from him.
     &quot;Surely you&#39;re civilized enough to at least listen,&quot; he prodded calmly.
     The bar-mistress closed her eyes for several moments, visibily struggling
to keep her temper in check.  &quot;Do you know how many people in this bar would
physically tear you apart if I asked them to?&quot; she growled in a low tone once
she finally opened her eyes again.
     The Dragoon simply made a gesture of dismissal with his free hand.  &quot;More
than a few, I would imagine.  So it goes like this,&quot; he said, ignoring the look
in her stormy gray eyes.  &quot;You tell me if I&#39;m right or wrong....&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re wrong,&quot; B&#39;nai interrupted acidly.
     &quot;If I&#39;m wrong,&quot; he continued without missing a beat, &quot;Then I&#39;ll just toss
back this drink, turn around, and walk away from this bar with the promise that
you will never have to see me in Sector One again.&quot;
     B&#39;nai narrowed her eyes as he fell silent, seeming to busy himself with a
protracted drink of his s&#39;zaz&#39;aren blue.  &quot;And?&quot; she finally demanded as her
brief attempt at cultivating patience failed.
     &quot;And if I&#39;m right,&quot; he replied slowly, setting his drink down with a muted
thump and looking her straight in the eyes, &quot;Then you let me borrow your couch
for the night.  Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t snore,&quot; he added as she promptly blinked
hard enough to almost physically be heard.
     &quot;You *must* be joking,&quot; she said, her jaw falling open in sheer amazement.
     &quot;Nope, that&#39;s what I&#39;m offering,&quot; he countered calmly.  &quot;Tell me I&#39;m right
and I spend the night on your couch since it&#39;ll be a hell of a lot easier on my
back than Glitter&#39;s co-pilot seat.  Tell me I&#39;m wrong and I&#39;m out of your hair.
And you know what, ne&#39;ana?  I&#39;m not even going to ask you to tell the truth if
you don&#39;t want to.  Not that I would know, mind you,&quot; he added with a shrug of
dismissal, &quot;But being a Dragoon means I give others a chance to be honorable
and truthful with themselves.&quot;
     B&#39;nai simply looked at him in silence for a number of moments before she
slowly shook her head to herself.  &quot;I&#39;ve heard some truly bizarre things come
out of the mouths of drunk people before, but you, Dragoon, win the prize for
the month.  Now sober up and go home,&quot; she sighed as she turned away from him
again and picked up a clean glass from the rack.
     &quot;Tell me if I&#39;m right or wrong about you, B&#39;nai,&quot; K&#39;tal said quietly as he
took another sip of his drink.  &quot;Tell me if my Chaos sense still works.  Oh,
yes,&quot; he added as she paused and turned around to give him a truly odd look.
&quot;It&#39;s a Chaos Factor power.  I can read people like books, you see, get a feel
for what kind of person they are by talking to them.  It&#39;s hard to put into
words or explain to others, however,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;But it does work, I assure
you.  I know you&#39;re hurt on the inside, B&#39;nai, and secretly want someone to
ease that pain for you.  But you don&#39;t know how to ask for help, or what shape
you want that help to take.
     &quot;Ironic, really,&quot; he continued, pausing to take another drink as he kept
his gaze focused on hers.  &quot;You work in a bar, you&#39;re literally surrounded by
a sea of denizens who come here to socialize and relax with one another.... and
you&#39;re stuck alone on your frozen iceberg in the middle of it all.  So close to
the answer you&#39;ve been craving, and yet so far from being able to grasp it.  So
when a perfect stranger like me walks in your door and offers to help, you just
brush it off and ignore that little voice in the back of your mind, the one
that whispers, &#39;What if...?&#39;&quot;
     The air became dangerously still as K&#39;tal tilted his head back, finishing
off the drink before gently setting the empty glass down on the bar.  He then
looked up at her, carefully studying every aspect of her expression as she
remained perfectly silent and virtually motionless.  &quot;So which is it, ne&#39;ana?&quot;
he finally spoke up after a minor eternity of silence had passed.  &quot;Am I right
about you, or am I wrong?  And I don&#39;t care how you answer me.  The important
thing is how you answer yourself.  It&#39;s called respect,&quot; he added with a slight
gesture of his hand.  &quot;Lie to me if it makes you feel better, but if you have
any lingering sense of self-respect for your life as you&#39;ve lived it, you&#39;ll
tell yourself the honest truth.&quot;
     It seemed to take the bar-mistress several moments to figure out what to
say in reply.  &quot;What exactly do you want from me, Dragoon?&quot; she finally said in
a low tone.
     &quot;To borrow your couch,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a faint sigh of resignation.
&quot;No, I&#39;m quite serious,&quot; he protested as she rolled her eyes.  &quot;All I&#39;m asking
for is a soft place to sleep tonight, or at least one that&#39;s softer than a
ground transport&#39;s bucket seat.  Having your company would be an extra bonus,
and I think we both understand what I&#39;m willing to offer, but I&#39;m not going to
waste my time or yours making an offer that doesn&#39;t remotely appeal to you.  I
have every intention of behaving, B&#39;nai, so if you had something in mind beyond
me taking up space on your couch you&#39;ll have to ask for it.  As a good friend
of mine is fond of saying, you&#39;ll get nothing more than what you ask for and
nothing less than what you expect.&quot;
     &quot;And what am I supposed to expect?&quot; she demanded with a dark glare.
     K&#39;tal simply shrugged in dismissal.  &quot;You&#39;ll have to tell me.  I said I
can read people to get a sense of what kind of person they are, but I&#39;m not
able to read minds.  Unless I&#39;m exposed to the Chaos Factor powers of someone
who can, at which point I can mimic them for a few seconds, but that takes a
fair amount of effort and tends to give us both headaches.  What sort of Chaos
powers do you have, if I may ask?&quot; he added with genuine curiosity.
     &quot;None of your concern,&quot; B&#39;nai retorted with a scowl.
     &quot;As you wish,&quot; he replied with another shrug.  &quot;So what&#39;ll it be, B&#39;nai?
Am I right or wrong about you?  Tell you what,&quot; he added as she simply gave him
a stony look.  &quot;You go ahead and think about it, and I&#39;ll be back in a moment.
You said the bathroom is on the right?&quot;
     &quot;Third door on the right,&quot; she growled as she turned away from him and
moved down to the other end of the bar.
     &quot;Thank you, ne&#39;ana,&quot; he muttered quietly to himself as he stood up and
made his way down the hall to the bathroom.  Business was promptly dealt with,
much to his bladder&#39;s relief, and he soon found himself sitting back down at
the bar.  Business seemed to have largely wound down after the performances,
as the rest of the tavern&#39;s population had started to thin out.  Octane and
Glitter were still preoccupied with a large group at one of the larger tables,
seeming to be enjoying themselves as they talked about something technical.
     He blinked and glanced down at his belt as his comm-link began to vibrate
hard in a series of staccato pulses.  Casting a quick glance around the room to
see if anyone was actively watching him, he plucked the device off of his belt
and discreetly held it up to his mouth.  &quot;K&#39;tal,&quot; he said quietly as he thumbed
the channel open and quickly dialed the volume down.
     &lt;Operations, routine comm-check,&gt; a voice said calmly.
     &quot;Copy, sounds good to me,&quot; the Dragoon replied.  &quot;Do me a favor and don&#39;t
bother Tolaris tonight, he&#39;s probably got his hands full right now and would
would most likely hit the ceiling if his comm-link went off.&quot;
     &lt;Copy, sir,&gt; the watch officer said.
     &quot;One more thing,&quot; K&#39;tal added in a low tone.  &quot;Pass word to Healer Relan
to expect a patient to arrive after breakfast, probable level 3 cardio issue,
but that&#39;s just a field assessment from an untrained denizen.&quot;
     There was a slight pause from the comm-link before it made a faint crackle
in response.  &lt;Copy message to Healer Relan, sir.  Anything else?&gt;
     &quot;Not that I&#39;m aware of,&quot; he replied with a sigh.  &quot;Keep me posted if you
catch wind of any new developments.  And for the love of the NegaForce, if a
Postman gets called move your ptankas first and tell me about it later once you
get a few spare moments.&quot;
     &lt;We copy, sir,&gt; the watch officer replied.  &lt;Operations out.&gt;
     K&#39;tal brushed his thumb across the switch to deactive the device and put
it back on his belt with another sigh.  He almost leapt off the bar stool when
he heard a soft metallic click behind him, quickly glancing over his shoulder
to find a key-card lying on the bar.  He then turned around to properly gaze
into the pair of stormy gray eyes that were giving him a truly piercing look.
     &quot;I&#39;m only going to say this once,&quot; B&#39;nai said in a very low tone, almost
inaudible against the background noise of the rest of the bar.  &quot;If you even
*think* of doing anything other than sitting on the couch, you&#39;re going to find
out what the Chaos Factor has done to me.  And I promise you, Dragoon,&quot; she
said as she leaned over, almost pressing her nose against his, &quot;You will *NOT*
like the result.&quot;
     K&#39;tal simply nodded his head in understanding, making sure that he didn&#39;t
touch her by accident.  &quot;Your hospitality is appreciated,&quot; he replied quietly
as he picked up the card.  &quot;And as I said earlier, I&#39;m not here to dishonor or
disrespect anyone.  Fair evening, lady B&#39;nai,&quot; he murmured as he stood up and
started to make his way towards the staircase, only to nearly have his back
broken against the bar as a hand grabbed his collar and yanked backwards.
     &quot;I&#39;m not kidding,&quot; she murmured in his ear in a glacial tone.  &quot;If I even
think you&#39;re up to something....&quot;
     &quot;B&#39;nai?&quot; K&#39;tal sighed, already feeling a dull ache start up in the spot
where his lower back had impacted the bar.  &quot;Either you trust me or you don&#39;t.
If you don&#39;t, here,&quot; he said as he held up the key-card.  He waited for several
seconds before lowering his hand and turning his head to look at her as best he
could while still pinned against the bar.  &quot;Okay, then.  Believe me when I say
your point is eminently clear, ne&#39;ana.  Now unless you want me to stick around
while you tidy up the bar....&quot;
     &quot;Whatever,&quot; B&#39;nai growled as she shoved him forward, almost tipping him
over to land face-first on the ground.
     K&#39;tal waited until his sense of balance stabilized before tugging on his
shirt to remove the wrinkles and glancing over his shoulder at her.  &quot;Fair
evening,&quot; he said simply before he set off for the staircase again.  A quick
look at the etchings on the key-card confirmed his suspicions that she hadn&#39;t
simply given him back the one she had offered earlier.
     You&#39;ll have to negotiate your own deal with G&#39;Lan, he thought as he made
his way up the slightly creaky staircase.  Yeah, I&#39;m sure that &#39;deal&#39; would
have been relatively straight-forward to hash out.  Okay, so instead of the
prostitute, I&#39;m going to be kept company by Colonel Azi&#39;mar&#39;s daughter, which
should be far more interesting and rewarding without requiring a hole in my
finances.  So why do I feel like I&#39;m about to walk onto a live-fire range with
a target drone taped to my ptanka? he thought with a physical sigh.
     &quot;Eeesh,&quot; he muttered to himself as he reached behind him to rub the sore
spot on his back.  &quot;And to think I tried to do this to avoid a back-ache,&quot; he
grumbled as he reached the door indicated on the key-card and slipped the thin
plastic wafer into the lock.  The lock promptly clicked open, flashing a green
light on the tiny display before ejecting the card with enough force to send it
flying through the air to bounce off his stomach.
     K&#39;tal glanced down at the ground in silence before gingerly bending down
to scoop up the card.  &quot;Thanks for the warning, ne&#39;ana,&quot; he murmured as he
stood back up and pushed the door open.  &quot;Yeah, this has all the hallmarks of
a fun night just waiting to happen....&quot;

                *               *               *               *

     The door closed quietly behind him but not quietly enough, sounding to his
ear like the cell door in a prison facility.  He knew that was far from the
case, but his nerves were shot as it was and the alcohol he drank earlier was
probably making things worse.  He took a single step into the room and came to
a stop as he realized that he wasn&#39;t alone.  Hardly an unexpected development,
but one that simply made his nerves all the more frazzled.
     &quot;Fair evening,&quot; T&#39;Del purred softly from the chair against the far wall.
She appeared to be dressed only in a simple robe, her slender legs tucked
beneath her as she studied him carefully with a faint smile on her lips.
     It took Tolaris several moments to decide what to say, absently reaching
up to rub the sore spot where his heart muscle was once again making him wonder
what precisely was wrong with it.  &quot;T&#39;Del,&quot; he said simply, not trusting his
tongue to form anything coherent.
     The redhead tilted her head slightly to one side as she continued to study
his expression.  &quot;Is that all you are going to say to me?&quot; she prodded him, her
smile starting to falter just slightly.
     Tolaris made a faint gesture with his free hand that was more of a twitch
than a conscious movement.  &quot;I guess I&#39;m.... a little speechless,&quot; he said as
calmly as he could.
     A delicate eyebrow rose up in response to his words.  &quot;I take it you liked
my performance?  I&#39;ll admit it was.... not my usual style,&quot; she confessed as a
rather fetching blush appeared on her cheeks.  &quot;But what can I say, I guess I
was.... inspired tonight.&quot;
     Tolaris closed his eyes briefly as a wave of pain crossed his chest for a
split-second.  &quot;T&#39;Del.... you could have said something,&quot; he finally managed to
say as he looked up at her with an almost pleading expression.
     &quot;Does it truly matter, Tolaris?&quot; she inquired in a soft voice, the look of
idle amusement fading from her face to be replace with a far more somber mien.
&quot;Are we not still childhood friends?&quot;
     It took the Dragoon a few moments to formulate a reply.  &quot;I don&#39;t know
about you, T&#39;Del,&quot; he said carefully, &quot;But I left my childhood behind a number
of centuries ago.  And, I think, so have you.&quot;
     &quot;To a certain extent,&quot; the redhead admitted, her expression once again
softening into a faint smile of amusement.  &quot;We all still retain aspects of our
childhood inside us, however, despite our best efforts at becoming supposedly
responsible and mature adults.  Or would you have me believe that you discarded
that youthful adventurism of yours when you joined the Dragoon Legion?&quot;
     &quot;Discarded, no,&quot; he replied with a faint sigh.  &quot;Tempered with the burdens
of responsibility and duty, yes.  But you already know that,&quot; he prodded.
     &quot;Do I?&quot; she purred as she slowly rose to her feet, the faint smile on her
face growing more pronounced.
     &quot;T&#39;Del....&quot; Tolaris said in a faint warning tone, sensing a trap.
     &quot;I&#39;ll admit that we&#39;ve changed,&quot; she said, seeming to deliberately take
her time in crossing the room towards him.  &quot;You&#39;ve moved up in the ranks to
lead a noble and respected Intelligence division, and I have tried to brush off
my celebrity past by hiding my true nature from others.  These days, I am just
a desert mechanic recognized by her peers for the quality of her fusion welds.&quot;
     Tolaris remained silent as T&#39;Del traced an arc through the air with a lone
finger, creating a bright contrail of ionized plasma at her fingertip that
vanished almost instantly.  &quot;And?&quot; he finally said after several seconds of
uneasy silence.  &quot;If I didn&#39;t know better, T&#39;Del, I&#39;d say you have something
on your mind you want to say but are stalling for some reason.&quot;
     She paused for a moment and blinked in surprise before slowly nodding in
acquiescence.  &quot;I guess this means I haven&#39;t changed all that much if you can
still read me like that,&quot; she said with a faint smile.
     &quot;I&#39;m a Dragoon,&quot; he reminded her quietly.  &quot;We&#39;re trained to do that.&quot;
     &quot;Perhaps, but you have to admit you have an unfair advantage over your
fellow Dragoons,&quot; she countered gently.  &quot;At least when it comes to me.&quot;
     Tolaris simply raised an eyebrow.  &quot;I&#39;m willing to bet K&#39;tal can beat me
two out of three times in reading people, but that&#39;s his nature.  T&#39;Del, we&#39;re
both adults now.  Spare me the childhood mystique and just tell me what&#39;s on
your mind.&quot;
     T&#39;Del blinked hard and edged back just slightly, giving him a somewhat
uneasy look.  &quot;That&#39;s just a little direct, don&#39;t you think?&quot; she chided in a
neutral tone.
     The Dragoon sighed and took a step back to lean against the wall, absently
rubbing his side again.  &quot;Pain tends to blunt your manners,&quot; he murmured.  His
breath caught in his throat as she moved over to him, one hand reaching out to
lightly probe the front of his shirt where his heart was.
     &quot;Should I ask?&quot; she inquired cautiously, looking up to stare into his gray
eyes.  She seemed to study him for several moments before slightly tilting her
head to one side.  The gesture suddenly reminded him of Susan&#39;s mannerisms,
prompting the faintest of heavings in his chest as he suppressed a soft laugh.
     &quot;Trust me,&quot; he murmured, allowing a faint smile of his own to touch his
lips.  &quot;If I knew what was causing it, I would have had it fixed awhile ago.&quot;
     &quot;I would hope so,&quot; she replied softly, giving him a gentle smile for a
brief moment before her expression faded again.  &quot;Are we still friends?&quot; she
asked suddenly.
     The question itself failed to surprise him, but the look of carefully
concealed worry in her eyes caught him off-guard.  &quot;Why wouldn&#39;t we be?&quot; he
asked.  &quot;Or are things supposed to change after.... enjoying.... your evening
performance?&quot;
     &quot;Time changes many things,&quot; she murmured as she glanced away from him, her
gaze coming to rest on the buttons on his shirt.  &quot;That which is familiar can
become.... alien, even while not appearing to have changed.  And yes, we have
both changed.  How much so is.... not yet known.&quot;
     &quot;You&#39;re afraid of something,&quot; Tolaris whispered as something clicked.
&quot;T&#39;Del, please.... just tell me what&#39;s bothering you.  I can&#39;t help you if I
don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in your mind.&quot;  He paused as the faintest of giggles
rose up from her chest even as a look of unease crossed her features.
     &quot;Some days I&#39;m not sure I know what&#39;s going on in my mind,&quot; she replied,
looking back up at him.  &quot;Most of my life is.... not so much a lie, but rather
an illusion.  I can&#39;t tell anyone what I truly do in the military....&quot;
     Her voice fell silent as Tolaris raised a finger and very gently pressed
it against her flawless lips.  &quot;You forget I am a guardian of secrets,&quot; he
reminded her.  &quot;There are things I&#39;ve encountered in the archives that I can&#39;t
discuss with anyone except the Queen, and even then only if she asks first.  I
know dark secrets about people that honor and duty forbid me from making their
mere existence known to others.  If your role in life must remain a secret,
even from friends.... I understand.&quot;
     It seemed for a moment that she might have started to cry, the edges of
her piercing green eyes becoming moist with emotion.  The softest of smiles
crossed her face as she looked into his eyes, nodding her head once before her
lips move slightly to brush against his finger.  She waited until he removed
his hand before taking a slow breath to speak.
     &quot;Of all the people I&#39;ve met in life,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;Of all those I&#39;ve
had both the pleasure and displeasure of working with, of all the friends I&#39;ve
ever made, both as a child and as an adult.... you&#39;re the only one who has ever
truly understood me.&quot;
     It took Tolaris a great deal of effort not to sigh heavily.  &quot;Not to be a
disappointment, but I hardly think I qualify as ever having understood you.&quot;
     &quot;I think you understand more than you realize,&quot; she countered softy as she
started to slowly move her hand, gently rubbing the front of his shirt and the
muscles underneath.
     &quot;You&#39;re still stalling,&quot; he prodded gently.
     T&#39;Del sighed quietly and closed her eyes.  &quot;I.... don&#39;t want to risk the
friendship we have,&quot; she whispered almost inaudibly.  &quot;I value it too much.&quot;
     Tolaris paused as another faint twinge of pain lanced through his ribs, a
faint frown forming on his face the longer he thought about it.  &quot;Why do I have
a feeling the trap is finally about to close on me?&quot; he spoke up, deciding it
was best to get things over with.
     &quot;When have I ever trapped you?&quot; she inquired.
     &quot;The time you set fire to the patch of v&#39;etu when I was up on the windmill
comes to mind,&quot; he said in a perfectly normal tone.  As expected, T&#39;Del&#39;s head
snapped up to give him a startled look.
     &quot;What?&quot; she demanded before blinking at the look of faint humor in his
eyes.  &quot;That was a Chaos accident and you know it!&quot; she protested with a frown.
&quot;And one far less damaging than the time you brought hailstones down on the
crop fields a week before the annual harvest was to begin.&quot;
     &quot;Nobody&#39;s life was in jeopardy from that,&quot; Tolaris countered.
     &quot;You were fine up there,&quot; T&#39;Del retorted with a scowl.
     &quot;After I blasted the area with a hurricane in panic,&quot; he pointed out.
     The redhead snorted quietly to herself in contempt and turned away from
him, tightly crossing her arms over her chest.  She visibly paused after a
moment and cast a sidelong glance back at him.  &quot;Wait, what just happened?&quot;
     &quot;A stress-relieving distraction,&quot; he replied with a faint smile.
     T&#39;Del just looked at him for a number of moments in silence before letting
out her breath in a muted sigh.  &quot;I&#39;m trying to be serious about my emotions
for once in my life,&quot; she said in an unusually subdued tone.  &quot;You could at
least have the decency to let me work up the courage to speak without breaking
the mood.&quot;
     &quot;Maybe you&#39;re just going about it the wrong way?&quot; he suggested.
     &quot;How so?&quot; she inquired archly, turning around to face him and absently
hugging herself tightly.
     &quot;You&#39;re worried you&#39;ll say something that will ruin our friendship,&quot; he
pointed out.  He waited until she finally nodded somberly before continuing.
&quot;I don&#39;t suppose you could have a measure of faith and trust in me when I say
there are very few things in life that could instantly dissolve such a long-
lasting friendship?&quot;
     &quot;And if this happens to historically be one of them?&quot; she whispered.
     Tolaris paused for a moment as the feeling of impending doom suddenly
returned.  &quot;Do you think it would be worth it?&quot; he ventured, not entirely sure
what he should be thinking at this point.  The sense of unease promptly tripled
as he saw the change in her eyes, a faint and rather subtle shift of emotion
that he knew was the only part of the maelstrom of emotions she was feeling
that she had failed to completely mask.
     &quot;You saw me on stage earlier,&quot; she finally replied, her voice so soft as
to almost be lost.  &quot;You tell me.&quot;
     The Dragoon simply closed his eyes and leaned against the wall, unable to
do anything else as his lungs suddenly felt like they were being crushed by a
massive weight.  He heard the faintest of noises a few moments later, the light
creaking of bare feet on a wooden floor as she approached him.  A gentle touch
followed, her fingertips cautiously probing the now-painful spot on his side
where his heart resided.
     &quot;Tolaris?&quot; she whispered quietly.
     &quot;What exactly do you want from me, T&#39;Del?&quot; he managed to reply.  &quot;Tell me,
and don&#39;t hold back.  You&#39;ve never been dishonest with me before, and I don&#39;t
see a need to be now.&quot;
     &quot;I don&#39;t want to lose you,&quot; she pleaded.
     &quot;Answer me,&quot; he demanded quietly as he finally found the courage to open
his eyes and look at his childhood friend.  His lungs promptly seized up as he
saw that her mask of emotions was gone, letting him see for himself the toll
the situation was suddenly taking on her.
     A minor eternity passed before she was able to draw in enough air to speak
properly.  &quot;I want you,&quot; she breathed.  She then gasped and jerked her hand
away from his chest as a torrent of electricity tore through her fingertips,
shocking her hard enough to leave transient sparkles in her vision.  &quot;TOLARIS!&quot;
     &quot;DON&#39;T!&quot; Tolaris said forcefully from between clenched teeth as she moved
to touch him again.  The wave of electricity continued to course through his
body as he struggled to get a grip on his weather-control powers.  The fiery
agony in his chest finally began to subside as he focused on discharging the
electrical corona through the wall behind him, letting the metal nails absorb
and disperse the worst of it without allowing them to overheat to their melting
points.
     T&#39;Del watched in wide-eyed silence as the crackling arcs of electrical
energy sweeping over him faded away one by one.  &quot;Tolaris?&quot; she ventured once
the last one had disappeared and he seemed to be able to breathe easier.
     &quot;I think....&quot; he rasped faintly before pausing to turn his head aside and
coughing forcefully.  &quot;Ouch.  I think I just figured out the cause of my heart
issues.  Ay&#39;cha navidshi....&quot;
     &quot;Chaos drift?&quot; she inquired in an openly worried tone.  It was a little-
understood and not overly common medical condition where the affected denizen&#39;s
Chaos Factor genes began to degenerate, slowly causing a loss of control over
their powers and eventually resulting in death as the degeneracy spread to the
rest of their DNA.
     &quot;Doubtful,&quot; Tolaris sighed as he rubbed his chest.  &quot;But like I said, I&#39;m
going to see a Healer in the morning.  T&#39;Del.... you could have said something
to me earlier,&quot; he said, giving her a visibly unsettled look.
     T&#39;Del glanced away from him and absently hugged herself again.  &quot;Like I
said, I.... guess I needed a little more time to grow up.  Tolaris....&quot;
     &quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; he whispered as he closed his eyes and sagged against the wall.
     The air seemed to become unusually heavy for several seconds before she
took in a deep breath.  &quot;Your human friend?&quot; she finally ventured.
     &quot;The friendship you and I share is strong,&quot; he said quietly as he tried to
open his eyes.  &quot;And, I have to confess, so are some of the feelings.  You awed
me as a child, and even now as an adult to think of being able to have you as
a life-mate is.... overwhelming.  Had we met like this a year ago and you spoke
those words to me, your robe would probably be on the floor by now and the bed
quietly protesting about our combined weight.&quot;
     &quot;Tolaris....&quot; she said, her unusual tone causing him to finally open his
eyes and look up at her.  He discovered that her cheeks were now a solid shade
of red that seemed to be actively trying to match the fiery shade of her hair.
     &quot;But the reality is this,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;I&#39;m in a deeply-committed
relationship with someone else.  Ami is my love and lover, and in a few years
she will become my life-mate.  You and I are friends, T&#39;Del, and in many ways
best friends.... but there are lines I can&#39;t cross and still think of myself as
being a man.  I won&#39;t forsake one woman for another, not even for the sake of
all that you and I once shared together.&quot;
     T&#39;Del simply nodded to him, most of the blush having faded at his words.
&quot;I understand,&quot; she said quietly as the barest hint of a smile seemed to cross
her face like a ghost.  She visibly paused and glanced away for several seconds
before refocusing on him.  &quot;Tolaris....&quot;
     A hollow laugh of amusement rose up from his chest as he finally found the
strength to push himself off of the wall and stand up straight.  &quot;We&#39;re still
friends, T&#39;Del,&quot; he assured her softly.
     &quot;I know,&quot; she replied, still visibly unsettled.  &quot;Do you.... do you think
I can meet her for myself?&quot;
     &quot;Hmm?&quot; Tolaris said, giving her a startled look.
     &quot;Your human lover,&quot; T&#39;Del added.  &quot;It sounds like she and I have more than
a few things in common.  Don&#39;t give me that look,&quot; she chided him as she saw
the change in his expression.  &quot;I&#39;m not going to assassinate her in a fit of
jealous rage or anything, you know that.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;ll.... see what I can do,&quot; Tolaris replied in a faintly uneasy tone,
not fully sure what to make of her request.
     T&#39;Del paused and tilted her head slightly.  &quot;You don&#39;t trust me?&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s not that,&quot; he assured her quickly.
     &quot;So what is it?&quot; she prodded in a faintly suspicious tone.
     The Dragoon just sighed quietly and made an absent gesture.  &quot;I&#39;m not too
sure how well she&#39;ll react,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;You have to remember that I still
don&#39;t truly grasp human emotions as well as I would like, and that they as a
species are truly chaotic life-forms.  Granted Ami tends to be far more....
emotionally predictable than her friends, but she is still young in human terms
and does have her faults.&quot;
     &quot;As do we all, Tolaris,&quot; T&#39;Del reminded him with a gentle smile.
     &quot;Some moreso than others,&quot; he muttered to himself, prompting a blink from
the redhead.
     &quot;Dare I...?&quot; she started to ask.
     Tolaris merely made a gesture of dismissal.  &quot;Let&#39;s just say that Maze&#39;s
human girlfriend is the most chaotic person I have ever encountered, and I do
believe that is saying something.  She&#39;s extremely friendly, but I can&#39;t even
begin to predict what she&#39;ll do in a given situation that calls for any sort of
creative mental processes.&quot;
     &quot;Almost sounds like Mint,&quot; T&#39;Del observed with a note of humor.
     &quot;Mint....&quot; Tolaris echoed as a relatively recent memory bubbled up from
the back of his mind.  &quot;Maze mentioned meeting her once.&quot;
     T&#39;Del nodded.  &quot;After your scout cruiser was forced to make an emergency
landing due to a gravity-shield failure.  I was elsewhere at the time, but rest
assured I heard about the visit.  Including details I would rather not have
heard,&quot; she added in a dry tone.
     Tolaris raised an eyebrow, able to all-too-clearly read between the lines.
&quot;Do you have that problem often, being an all-female unit in isoalted terrain?&quot;
he inquired cautiously.
     A delicate eyebrow arched up in response, giving him a somewhat unamused
look.  &quot;Of course not,&quot; she replied with a faint hint of crispness to her tone.
&quot;Mint, however, has a penchant for indulging in such things.  No doubt she has
already introduced herself to the Dragoon Legion by this hour, but it is often
best not to speculate unnecesarily about such things.  No doubt we will come
across personal anecdotes regarding the truth during breakfast, much as some of
us would rather not suffer through the details.&quot;
     &quot;Maybe Alex was right,&quot; Tolaris grunted.  He glanced up at the curious
look on her face and added, &quot;Perhaps it is the hair color after all.&quot;
     T&#39;Del made a casual gesture of dismissal as she slowly approached him.
&quot;Mint&#39;s personal business is her own, so long as it doesn&#39;t affect either her
health or the quality of her work.  Seeing how neither has ever proven to be a
cause for concern, her antics are simply ignored to the best of our ability.
And as my section chief reminded me lately, we all have our vices.&quot;
     &quot;Vices, T&#39;Del?  You?&quot; he spoke up in a half-teasing tone.  &quot;Do tell.&quot;
     &quot;Master Chief Octane seems to think my indulgence in the performing arts
constitutes a questionable vice,&quot; she said demurely as she very lightly pressed
herself against him, causing him to blink hard in surprise.  &quot;But we all have
our own views of such things.&quot;
     &quot;T&#39;Del....&quot; he said in a low tone of warning as she reached up to rest her
hand on his chest.
     &quot;Tell me that in another time and place you....&quot; she started to say before
falling silent as he placed a pair of fingers over her lips.
     &quot;That is a very dangerous line of thought,&quot; he said quietly.  &quot;We are not
in another time or place, but are in the here and now.  We both have to respect
that.... as friends.  You are without question beautiful beyond words, and yes,
moreso without the burden of clothing.  Believe me when I say I appreciate the
natural beauty and grace of the female form.... of several species,&quot; he added.
     &quot;I&#39;m told the difference between us is cosmetic,&quot; she murmured, moving her
head back just enough to allow her lips to move while not breaking contact with
his fingers.
     &quot;A few patches of hair and no variation in the color of their blood,&quot; he
replied quietly.  &quot;Not entirely cosmetic, but hardly noticeable until you&#39;re
either intimate or in a barfight with them.&quot;
     &quot;And how does the intimacy compare?&quot; she inquired softly, her eyebrows
arching up as his cheeks suddenly tinted gray.
     &quot;Being with her is like nothing else I&#39;ve ever encountered,&quot; he confessed.
&quot;But I wouldn&#39;t know how it compares to being with anyone else.  T&#39;Del....&quot;
     The faintest of smiles crossed her lips as she reached up to lay a pair of
fingertips on his lips to still them, mirroring the way his were still lightly
resting on hers.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t know,&quot; she murmured, prompting a surprised blink
from him.  &quot;But one day I would like to.  Perhaps it is all that Mint claims it
to be, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll find out for myself eventually.  You look surprised,&quot; she
added in a faintly coy tone.
     &quot;I shouldn&#39;t be,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;But I can see why you would be just a
little reluctant to.  After all, when half the planet lusted after you for a
good portion of your youth....&quot;
     &quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; she said with a patient sigh, giving him a look that
said all it needed to about her awareness of what was quietly fantasized about
during her years as a global supermodel.  &quot;Remind me again what your excuse was
for waiting over seven centuries to take a lover?&quot; she prodded in a coy tone.
     Tolaris remained silent for a number of moments before sighing quietly.
&quot;I guess I just never found the right woman,&quot; he murmured, still acutely aware
of her fingertips against his lips.
     &quot;It sounds like a fair excuse for me as well, don&#39;t you think?&quot; she said
lightly.
     &quot;Only if you&#39;re looking for another woman,&quot; Tolaris pointed out, drawing
a faint look of reproachment and a light tap of her fingers against his lips.
     &quot;I assure you I&#39;m not,&quot; she replied dryly.  &quot;Although I was given several
such.... offers.... while still a supermodel.  You may safely presume they were
respectfully declined.&quot;
     &quot;The humans have a saying,&quot; he observed lightly.  &quot;Whatever floats your
boat.&quot;
     &quot;Be that as it may,&quot; she retorted with faintly edged humor as she removed
her fingers from his mouth, &quot;I assure you that I am not that kind of woman.&quot;
     &quot;Never meant to imply that you were,&quot; he teased with a gleam of humor in
his gray eyes.  An uneasy silence began to develop as they continued to look at
one another, his light moment of humor fading away to be replaced by a more
somber mood.  &quot;T&#39;Del....&quot; he started to say quietly.
     &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she murmured in an almost weary tone, her gaze briefly
falling to the buttons on his tunic before looking up at him again.
     &quot;Do you, now?&quot; Tolaris said in slight confusion.  &quot;Do tell.&quot;
     A faint smile tugged at the corners of the redhead&#39;s lips.  &quot;You were
about to ask &#39;so what now?&#39; or words to that effect, correct?&quot; she prodded.
     &quot;The humans have another saying, one that covers this sort of situation,&quot;
he replied in a perfectly unreadable tone.
     T&#39;Del raised a delicate eyebrow in response.  &quot;Do they, now?&quot; she purred
in an almost silken tone of idle amusement.  &quot;Do tell.&quot;
     &quot;It&#39;s a simple, yet profound expression,&quot; he replied.  &quot;D&#39;oh....&quot;
     The softest of giggles rose up from her chest as she leaned forward to
rest her body&#39;s weight against his.  &quot;I&#39;ll not ask for a translation,&quot; she said
quietly, &quot;Assuming one even exists, but I think the meaning is clear enough.&quot;
     &quot;T&#39;Del?&quot; he said gently, all too aware of the faintly electric sensation
of her body against his.
     &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she murmured again, leaning forward to rest her head on his
shoulder.
     That prompted a raised eyebrow from Tolaris.  &quot;Didn&#39;t we just have this
discussion a few moments ago?&quot; he prodded.  &quot;I think you&#39;re stalling again.&quot;
     The softest of sighs tickled his throat as she exhaled.  &quot;I suppose I am
stalling,&quot; she admitted.  &quot;But can you blame me?&quot;
     &quot;To a certain extent, I can,&quot; he replied calmly.  &quot;So answer the question:
Now what do we do?&quot;  A faint thread of ice started to work its way down his
spine as he was answered with a quiet and rather coy chuckle in his ear.
     &quot;Ideally?&quot; she whispered very softly, her tone wavering just slightly.
&quot;You pick me up, carry me over to the bed, and help me do something about my
maiden status.&quot;  She quickly gritted her teeth against the agonzing wave of
electricity that coursed through them both for several painful seconds.  She
waited until the worst of the shock had faded away before tilting her head back
to give him an unamused look.
     &quot;Sorry,&quot; he muttered, his face taking on a visibly gray pallor.
     &quot;Have you always reacted this way to emotional shocks?&quot; she inquired in a
soft, yet demanding tone.
     Tolaris exhaled quietly and closed his eyes, shaking his head to himself.
&quot;No, just since.... well, I&#39;m not entirely sure it was an actual heart-attack,
but let&#39;s just say there was a definite coronary incident several months ago.
And oddly enough, it likewise involved a truly beautiful and special woman,
dancing for me in all her naked glory before making just such a proposition.
And as Ami was the one to offer it of her own free will and understanding, it
was.... duly accepted.&quot;
     T&#39;Del blinked in surprise, her eyebrows arching up for several seconds as
she studied him.  &quot;It figures,&quot; she muttered as she slowly let her breath out,
her whole body seeming to deflate and wilt with resignation.  She then held
perfectly still as he reached out to her, wrapping one arm around her waist and
pulling her against him until her head rested on his shoulder again.
     &quot;I don&#39;t mean to be cruel, T&#39;Del,&quot; he said quietly, his eyes still gently
closed, &quot;But did you honestly think you could reappear in my life after three
centuries of empty silence, a silence that you could have been easily broken at
any moment you wanted, and expect me to set aside all that I&#39;ve done in order
to be your life-mate?&quot;
     A faint huff of air rose up from her chest that could have easily have
been either a soft laugh or a quiet sob.  &quot;Ideally, yes,&quot; she admitted, almost
too quietly for him to hear.  &quot;After all, a girl can dream, can&#39;t she?  Even if
they are selfish dreams.  But I know as well as you do that idealism doesn&#39;t
often work in this life.  As for tonight, my childhood friend,&quot; she sighed as
she hugged him tightly, &quot;Tonight I will settle for being carried to bed and
tucked in for the night.  You are, of course, welcome to join me.  Even if you
insist on behaving,&quot; she added with just the faintest hint of a smile on her
lips as she leaned back to look at him.
     Tolaris paused as he saw the single tear making a slow progression down
her cheek, not entirely sure what to make of it.  &quot;Define join you?&quot; he asked
in an openly uneasy tone.
     The faint smile on her face seemed to widen as she regarded him.  &quot;Back to
back as friends do in the darkness of night,&quot; she replied quietly.  &quot;So close
together, and yet so far away from one another.  Just like it was in the barn
that night.&quot;
     &quot;The night that never was,&quot; he murmured softly, one hand absently coming
up to wipe the solitary tear away.  The gesture seemed to take her by surprise,
her piercing green eyes blinking hard once she realized what he was doing.
     &quot;Damn it,&quot; she breathed, more to herself than to him as she turned away.
A delicate blush sprang up on her cheeks, embarrassed to have been so emotional
in his presence like that.  She nearly squealed in surprise as he stepped over
and swept her off her feet in a single fluid motion.
     &quot;Damnation takes many forms,&quot; he said quietly as he carefully carried her
over to the bed.  He knelt down before laying her on the sheets, making sure
not to get his arms caught beneath her weight.  &quot;Be grateful that yours doesn&#39;t
involve constant electrical shocks.&quot;
     She remained silent as he untucked the sheets and proceeded to slip her
beneath them in a complicated evolution that barely disturbed her sense of
inertia.  Had she not been watching him, she would have thought that the sheets
had simply flowed out from beneath her before gently cocooning her in a soft
embrace.
     &quot;Tolaris....&quot; she started to say before she suddenly found his lips on
hers in a very light but warm kiss.  The sensation caused her to all but melt
into the sheets, feeling the emotional tension draining out of her body as if
a plug had been pulled.
     &quot;As Prince Darian is fond of saying,&quot; Tolaris murmured once the kiss was
broken, &quot;Lead me not to temptation for I can find it myself.  A year makes all
the difference, T&#39;Del.  A year earlier and I&#39;d join you without hesitation....
or fear of consequence.  But my heart belongs to another, and thus so does my
body, and I can&#39;t afford to risk destroying all that I hold dear in a moment of
failed willpower or weakened virtue.  I won&#39;t take that risk.  Please tell me
you understand.&quot;
     &quot;I do,&quot; she whispered as she stretched herself forward, just enough for
her lips to brush against his for a brief moment.  &quot;Forgive me for....&quot; she
started to say before she felt the warmth of his lips on hers again, pressing
her back against the pillow and all but driving the air from her lungs in a
blissful exodus.
     &quot;I&#39;ve never forgiven you before for just being yourself, T&#39;Del,&quot; he said
with a soft chuckle of humor once he had lifted his head away from her.  &quot;And
I don&#39;t see a need to start now.  Sleep well, my friend.&quot;
     Despite the myriad of emotions roiling within her that only minutes ago
had threatened her peace of mind, she found a sense of calmness and peace start
to encompass her like a second blanket.  &quot;Sleep well, my friend,&quot; she echoed
quietly, already feeling the weight of her eyelids increasing with each pulse
of her heart.
     She tried to open her eyes to observe when she heard the rustling of his
clothes, giving up after several seconds when her body simply refused to obey.
The far corner of the bed creaked suddenly, and for one brief instant she had
visions of him coming to join her after all.  The room was plunged into total
darkness a moment later, suggesting that he had simply bumped the bed on his
way over to the wall switch, and the muted groaning of the couch confirmed her
quiet dismay that he was indeed &#39;going to behave&#39; tonight.
     Mother was right, the redhead found herself thinking as she started to
drift off to sleep at a surprisingly rapid rate.  Some battles just aren&#39;t
meant to be won.  At least, not until later....

                *               *               *               *

     &quot;Look,&quot; Leda sighed as the elevator doors parted with a soft chime.  &quot;Just
admit that meeting her parents freaked you out and move on, okay?  Eeesh, it&#39;s
been half an hour and you&#39;re still whining about it.&quot;
     Alex made a quiet grumbling noise as she followed Leda out of the elevator
and across the exposed corridor of the apartment building with Michelle in tow.
&quot;I&#39;m just saying I don&#39;t believe it, that&#39;s all,&quot; the blonde protested yet
again.  &quot;Queen Serenity&#39;s her mother, not that lady we met.  I know, I know,&quot;
she sighed as Leda cast a dark glance over her shoulder, &quot;So maybe she did give
birth to the Princess&#39; reincarnation, but you just have to look at them to tell
she&#39;s not related to them.  Or that snotty little brat she calls her brother,&quot;
she added with another flat growl.
     The brunette just sighed quietly as she fished for her keys in her skirt
pocket.  &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll give you the brat part,&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;I&#39;ve only had to
deal with him a couple of times and I&#39;m pretty sure a solid spanking or two
would be enough to straighten him out, but you learn to ignore him.  And to be
perfectly honest here?&quot; she added, casting a mild look over her shoulder as she
came to her door and started to unlock it.  &quot;Serena wasn&#39;t much better when I
first encountered her.&quot;
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Alex blinked as both she and Michelle came to a sudden halt with
almost perfectly identical expressions of disbelief etched on their faces.
&quot;Back up a sec, hon, what&#39;s your problem with the Princess?&quot;
     &quot;Look,&quot; Leda said in a low tone as she turned to face them, keeping her
voice fairly quiet.  &quot;Things were different back then.  I had no idea I had an
elemental core inside my soul, and she had only been under Luna&#39;s guidance for
a few months.  When we first met, she was a somewhat whiny and spoiled cry-baby
with a fairly loud mouth who had a hell of a lot of growing up to do.  Go ask
Ami if you don&#39;t believe me,&quot; she added firmly as she received a look of shock
from Michelle and a somewhat hostile glare from Alex.  &quot;I&#39;m just calling it
like I saw it, okay?  She wasn&#39;t the loving angel that she is now, and I ain&#39;t
talking about her wings.  Why are you still locked?&quot; she suddenly snarled as
she turned her attention back to the lock and fussed with the key.
     Alex and Michelle traded uneasy looks as Leda continued to growl at the
reticent lock, jiggling the key back and forth over the tumblers.  There was a
hard click as the latch finally yielded, allowing the brunette to twist the
knob to the left and open the door.
     &quot;Finally,&quot; Leda huffed as she made her way inside.  &quot;That&#39;s the second
time this month that it&#39;s done that.  Maybe I should ask Mina to look at it....
assuming she hasn&#39;t tried to pick it herself just out of simple curiosity,&quot; she
added in a faintly sour tone.  &quot;That better not be why it&#39;s jamming, either, or
she&#39;s going to be in a world of hurt....&quot;
     &quot;So back to the Princess, babe,&quot; Alex said in a wary tone as she followed
Leda into the apartment.  She took a deep breath to continue and paused, her
nose visibly twitching for a moment.  &quot;Hang on,&quot; she rasped as she quickly
stepped back out onto the open-air corridor, briefly waving a hand in front of
her face.
     &quot;Alex?&quot; Michelle asked, giving her a concerned look.  She blinked as she
caught a whiff of the air that was wafting out from inside Leda&#39;s apartment,
turning around to cast a faintly intrigued look inside.  &quot;Umm... Leda?&quot; she
called out in a fairly neutral tone.
     &quot;Now what?&quot; a faintly weary voice drifted out from within the kitchen.
     &quot;What&#39;s that st...?&quot; Alex started to say before Michelle quickly reached
up to clamp a hand over her mouth.
     &quot;Eh?&quot; Leda inquired as she poked her head out to look at them.
     &quot;Did you.... leave out an air-freshener or something?&quot; Michelle asked in
a fairly delicate tone, trying to look calm and composed while actively keeping
Alex muffled.
     Leda gave her a confused look for a moment before testing the air herself.
&quot;No, I don&#39;t use.... oh, the carpet deodorizer!&quot; she said as it dawned on her.
&quot;I completely forgot about that.  I laid some out before going to school and
figured I&#39;d vacuum it up when I got home, but obviously I figured I&#39;d have been
home shortly after dinner.  Hang on, this&#39;ll only take a few to clean up,&quot; she
promised as she turned away and started to dig into the storage closet.
     &quot;Trust me, babe,&quot; Alex muttered after managing to pry Michelle&#39;s hand away
from her lips.  &quot;Whatever might be living in there *has* to be dead by now.
Holy crap, my sinuses are still stinging....&quot;
     &quot;Alex, stop it,&quot; Michelle protested quietly.  &quot;It&#39;s just some eucalyptus.
Well.... a lot of it,&quot; she admitted with another glance over her shoulder as
she heard the sound of a vacuum starting up.
     The blonde rubbed her nose and took a step away from the door to lean on
the concrete railing, making sure not to crush the overnight bag still slung
over her shoulder.  &quot;She growing her own forest in there or something?&quot; she
grumbled.  &quot;C&#39;mon, that lone stick of incense Lady Mars lit that one day was
bad enough, but it smells like Leda set fire to the whole tree....&quot;
     &quot;I liked that incense,&quot; Michelle protested, giving her lover a faintly
upset look.  &quot;Granted I wouldn&#39;t burn it too often, but it was only strong
enough to tickle your senses every so often which is how incense should be.&quot;
     Alex just rolled her eyes.  &quot;You&#39;re supposed to tickle with a feather,
babe,&quot; she grumbled.  &quot;That is using a shovel,&quot; she added with a casual gesture
towards the open doorway.  She sighed quietly and started to absently look
around at the area.  &quot;This isn&#39;t too bad, to be honest,&quot; she observed.  &quot;Not
that we ever had everything packed together like a box of fish on a wharf, but
I suppose I could get used to this.&quot;
     &quot;Mmmmm,&quot; Michelle absently hummed to herself, keeping a casual eye on the
movement of the vacuum cleaner inside the apartment.  &quot;It is a little on the
cramped side for my taste,&quot; she admitted quietly.
     &quot;What, the apartment or the city?&quot; Alex inquired as she reached out to toy
with a lock of her lover&#39;s aquamarine hair.
     &quot;Both,&quot; Michelle sighed as she moved to lean against Alex an an entirely
unconscious and almost automatic gesture.  &quot;I mean, we haven&#39;t really seen the
inside of her home yet, but if it&#39;s like Darian&#39;s apartment there won&#39;t be a
lot of living space available.&quot;
     &quot;Eh, whatever,&quot; Alex replied with a wave of her free hand, her other hand
still idly stroking Michelle&#39;s hair.  &quot;It&#39;s not like our rooms in the palace
were all that spacious.&quot;
     &quot;Yes, but we spent how much time in there?&quot; Michelle countered quietly.
&quot;It&#39;s one thing to not have copious amounts of elbow room when sleeping or just
lazing around, but we didn&#39;t have to eat or really live in our rooms either.
We had how much space to roam around in when we weren&#39;t on duty?  The library,
the gardens, the bathhouses, the dining halls, the courtyards....&quot;
     Alex paused as she sensed a change in Michelle&#39;s voice.  &quot;Something in
particular on your mind, love?&quot; she prodded as she saw the slightly forlorn
look staring back at her.
     &quot;We&#39;re going to have to try to live in this city on our own,&quot; Michelle
spoke up in a muted tone.  &quot;I mean, I know they&#39;re not going to kick us out of
the cathedral or anything.... or at least not until you manage to upset Tolaris
like that again....&quot;
     &quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Alex protested with a frown.  &quot;You really expected me to
just blindly trust him right out the gate simply on Ami&#39;s say-so?  And that
whole kidnapping business with the Princess just shows that you really can&#39;t
trust the Negaverse.&quot;
     Michelle just closed her eyes.  &quot;Alex, don&#39;t start with that,&quot; she pleaded
quietly.  She sighed as she felt an arm wrap around her waist, gently pulling
her into a comforting embrace.  She yielded almost instantly, finding it very
hard to resist the blonde&#39;s touch for any reason.
     &quot;Anyway,&quot; Alex muttered as she briefly nuzzled her lover&#39;s ear, eliciting
a muted purr from her by simple reflex.  &quot;So back to what you were saying.&quot;
     &quot;We can&#39;t stay at the cathedral forever,&quot; Michelle murmured softly.  &quot;It&#39;s
not really ours to use, it belongs to Tolaris and the denizens.  Again, I don&#39;t
see them forcing us out, but at some point we&#39;re going to have to get our own
place to live.  Someplace where it&#39;s just you and me,&quot; she added in an even
softer tone.  &quot;Like we&#39;ve always dreamed about.&quot;
     Alex suppressed a hollow laugh.  &quot;As if Sue will leave us alone.&quot;
     &quot;She will,&quot; Michelle assured her quietly as she closed her eyes, leaning
harder against the blonde.  &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, she&#39;ll still drop in when she
feels the need to for one reason or another, but when was the last time she
interrupted us for anything that wasn&#39;t important or an emergency?  And Alex?&quot;
she quickly added as she opened one eye to give her a moderate look.  &quot;Before
you bring up the tropical fish incident, that really would have been important
if that had been a live conch in the tank with us.&quot;
     The blonde just tilted her head back to look up at the sky for several
moments before looking back down.  &quot;Whatever, babe,&quot; she said neutrally.  She
glanced up as she saw Leda walking out of the apartment with a small rug in
her hands.  &quot;Safe to breathe yet, hon?&quot; she inquired, drawing a subtle poke in
the ribs from Michelle.
     &quot;Almost,&quot; Leda replied absently as she moved a few steps away from them
before holding the rug out over the railing and snapping it hard.  A cloud of
tiny particles promptly flowed out from it like a ghost, seeming to hover in
the still air before drifting downwards at a leisurely pace.  &quot;Okay, so maybe
I went a little overboard with the deodorizer this time,&quot; she admitted as she
snapped the rug several more times until she couldn&#39;t see any new powder being
shaken loose.  &quot;I&#39;ve got the windows open and a box fan running on medium, so
just give me another couple of minutes.  Sorry about this,&quot; she apologized with
a faint blush as she carried the rug back into the apartment.
     &quot;S&#39;okay, babe,&quot; Alex said absently, all too aware of the heavy scent of
eucalyptus lingering in the air and trying not to breathe too deeply.  &quot;You
know,&quot; she spoke up quietly once Leda was out of earshot, &quot;Now that I stop and
think about it, I think I just figured out what that smell was in Darian&#39;s
apartment.  And trust me, it wasn&#39;t eucalyptus,&quot; she muttered sourly.  &quot;Maybe
we should insist he borrow her vacuum for a couple of days or something.&quot;
     &quot;Alex....&quot; Michelle just sighed in resignation.
     &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just making an observation, that&#39;s all,&quot; the blonde protested
casually as she started to look around the region again.  She paused to study
the movements of cars on a side-street not too far away before puffing out her
cheeks in a muted sigh.  &quot;This isn&#39;t going to be easy, you know.  Living down
here on the planet by ourselves,&quot; she added when she got a curious look.  &quot;I
mean, you&#39;re right about how Sue isn&#39;t truly going to leave us out on our own,
and we&#39;ll always have the others for company and tips on how to live and all,
but this is going to be like living in a steel jungle with strange natives all
around us.  Take that, for instance,&quot; she added as she gestured with her chin
towards a passing motorcycle.  &quot;What the hell is that?  I mean, it looks like
a two-wheeled rover, but it&#39;s pretty damn skinny and there&#39;s no armor at all.&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;ll adapt,&quot; Michelle assured her gently, reaching up to take her hand
in hers and intertwining their fingers together.  &quot;It probably won&#39;t be very
graceful at first, but we can do this.&quot;
     &quot;There we go,&quot; Leda said cheerfully as she came out of the apartment,
absently dusting her skirt off.  &quot;Sorry about the mess, guys, I didn&#39;t think
I&#39;d be hosting company tonight like this.&quot;
     &quot;You sure this isn&#39;t an imposition?&quot; Michelle spoke up quickly before Alex
could open her mouth to fuss about the lingering eucalyptus smell.
     Leda simply waved her hand in dismissal.  &quot;Bah, I already told you that
it&#39;s cool.  Besides, surprise company can be fun when it&#39;s the right company.
Oh, and before you get all bent out of shape, I didn&#39;t deodorize the bedroom
carpeting since it doesn&#39;t get nearly as much traffic as the living room.&quot;
     &quot;Unless it&#39;s Sue&#39;s bedroom you&#39;re talking about,&quot; Alex said dryly as she
pushed herself off of the railing.
     &quot;Alex,&quot; Michelle sighed in resignation.
     Leda shook her head to herself.  &quot;Not even going to ask.  Anyway, come on
in.  Can&#39;t promise you I&#39;ll be able to stay up for too much longer, since I&#39;ve
got school in the morning, but I should be able to get you two situated before
having to go pass out.&quot;
     &quot;Thanks, babe,&quot; Alex said with a smile as she started to enter the small
apartment.  She paused after a moment when she realized that Michelle hadn&#39;t
moved and was staring out over the railing.  &quot;Mich?&quot; she prompted.
     &quot;Oh, sorry,&quot; Michelle apologized as she refocused on the group with a
faint blush.  She cast the briefest of glances back towards the street below
before following the other two girls inside, only unconsciously aware of the
feeling of being watched by the dark-colored sedan parked out on the dimly-lit
side-street.
     &quot;Nice,&quot; Alex commented as she glanced around the small foyer.  The kitchen
was immediately off to her left, while on her immediate right was a series of
closet doors.  The combination living room and dining room was spread out in a
rough L-shape ahead of her, while the hallway leading to the bathroom and pair
of bedrooms was just past the closet doors.
     &quot;Eh, it&#39;s home,&quot; Leda admitted with a shrug as she waited for Michelle to
pass by her before closing and locking the door.  &quot;It&#39;s not much, but with the
cost of rent being what it is in this part of town, it&#39;s reasonable for a one-
child family.  Wha&#39;cha looking for?&quot; she asked as she noticed Alex peering down
the length of the short hallway.
     &quot;Which door&#39;s which?&quot; the blonde inquired as she absently slid the small
overnight bag off of her shoulder.
     &quot;Bathroom&#39;s on the near right, guest room on the far right, my room&#39;s on
the left,&quot; Leda replied as she tossed her backpack onto the floor next to the
couch in the living room.
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; the idly distracted voice drifted back as Alex continued to take
her time in looking around.  She carefully opened the guest room door to look
around, her eyebrows arching up in mild surprise before she stepping further
into the room.
     Michelle carefully glanced around the living room before making her way
over to sit on the far end of the couch.  &quot;This is about the same size as
Darian&#39;s apartment, right?&quot; she asked tentatively.
     The brunette paused for a moment to think, absently chewing on the edge of
her lip.  &quot;Eh,&quot; she hedged.  &quot;Darian&#39;s place only has one bedroom and doesn&#39;t
have a potter&#39;s balcony, but I think he might have a bigger living room.  Don&#39;t
know for sure, we&#39;ve never tried to compare them,&quot; she admitted with a shrug.
     &quot;Oh,&quot; Michelle replied, casting a curious glance at the small glass door
set into the far wall.  &quot;What&#39;s a potter&#39;s balcony?&quot;
     &quot;Heh,&quot; Leda chuckled as she went into the kitchen and opened up the
refrigerator.  &quot;It&#39;s a really small balcony to give you the illusion of having
outside space.  Most people just put a few potted plants and flowerbeds out
there, which is why I call it a potter&#39;s balcony.  Feel free to take a look,
just twist the latch to the left to unlock it.&quot;
     &quot;Hmm,&quot; Michelle hummed to herself, her eyebrows arching up with curiosity
as she stood up and walked over to the glass door.  It unlocked just as Leda
said it would, allowing her to slide it open and step out onto a disturbingly
small walled terrace.  The view was hardly a spectacular one in her opinion, as
all she saw was a wide expanse of city buildings cast against the last vestiges
of twilight.  The immediate environment wasn&#39;t to her liking either, tainted
with the stench of engine exhaust from the fleet of cars driving around below
and filled with the muted sounds of a metropolitan city slowly winding down to
a nocturnal idle.
     She sighed quietly to herself, knowing that this was a very far cry from
the calm and tranquil pace of life in the Moon Kingdom.  Almost by relfex she
began to scan the sky, trying to locate the silvery pool of radiance that was
her former home.  Her spirits sank slightly lower when she couldn&#39;t find it,
realizing that it was either behind her where she couldn&#39;t see it at this hour,
or that it wasn&#39;t in a readily visible phase.
     &quot;So what do we have here, babe?&quot; Alex asked quietly as she stepped out to
join her on the small terrace.  &quot;Blech,&quot; she added sourly as she surveyed the
view and took a cautious whiff of the evening air.  &quot;I know it didn&#39;t smell too
good out on the street earlier, but it seems to get worse higher up.  Eeesh.&quot;
     Michelle nodded sadly in agreement.  &quot;They&#39;ve really changed down here,
haven&#39;t they?&quot; she murmured.  &quot;I know Susan said that the future would be a
difference place, but I didn&#39;t think we&#39;d find out for ourselves like this.
And I don&#39;t think she did either,&quot; she added with another quiet sigh.
     &quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Alex muttered.  &quot;Hell, I thought things had reached
their peak in the seventeenth-century with the way Sue kept carrying on about
life in Baghdad and Cairo at the time and all.  Now what?&quot; she added as the
sound of a siren started up in the distance.
     &quot;Hey,&quot; Leda said as she poked her head out of the open doorway, holding a
small wineglass in her hand.  &quot;I take it the eucalyptus smell is still on the
strong side or something?&quot;
     &quot;Nah, we&#39;re just checking out the city, that&#39;s all,&quot; Alex replied with a
brief glance at the wineglass.  &quot;Any idea what that noise is?&quot; she asked with
a gesture over her shoulder.
     &quot;Which one?&quot; Leda inquired as she took an absent sip of the plum wine.
     &quot;That siren,&quot; Michelle spoke up in a faintly uneasy tone.  She blinked as
she saw a burst of flashing lights in the distance, seeming to cross part of
the street before disappearing behind another building.
     &quot;Ambulance, probably,&quot; Leda commented.  &quot;The fire department has a small
station several blocks from here, you can usually hear it when they get called
up for something.  Yeah, there&#39;s the tower truck,&quot; she pointed out as a second
siren started up, pointing with her free hand to the intersection where the
vehicle was expected to cross.
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Alex said in a neutral tone as a much larger emergency vehicle went
through the intersection as expected, the brief exposure to the flashing red
and white strobes casting all sorts of reflections across the buildings.  &quot;I
take it that&#39;s not a good thing, then?&quot;
     &quot;Probably not,&quot; Leda replied as she stepped back inside the apartment.
     &quot;Noisy bastard,&quot; Alex pointed out as she tried to follow the movements of
the fire engine as it traversed several blocks.  &quot;Wait, what&#39;s it doing now?&quot;
     Leda had to suppress a chuckle at the sheer innocence of asking a question
that a five-year-old could readily answer.  &quot;That&#39;s the horn,&quot; she explained.
&quot;It lets other cars who can&#39;t see it know that he&#39;s approaching an intersection
and that they need to pay attention and get the hell out of the way.  They hve
right-of-way on the roads, you see, so they don&#39;t have to stop for red lights,
but they still need to let other traffic know they&#39;re going to brew through an
intersection.  It&#39;s a safety measure.&quot;
     &quot;Brew through?&quot; Michelle echoed, giving her a curious look.
     &quot;Figure of speech,&quot; the brunette replied with a casual shrug.  &quot;They&#39;re on
a mission, they have absolute right-of-way, and they brake for nobody.&quot;
     &quot;Peachy,&quot; Alex commented.  &quot;Speaking of brews, wha&#39;cha got there?&quot;
     &quot;Alex,&quot; Michelle promptly spoke up in a faintly glacial warning tone.
     &quot;What the hell, babe?  I&#39;m just asking what she&#39;s drinking....&quot;
     &quot;You don&#39;t need any alcohol.&quot;
     &quot;I&#39;m not asking for any.  Leda, did you hear me ask for any?&quot;
     &quot;Yo, I&#39;ve got nothing to do with this,&quot; Leda protested as she took a pair
of steps back from the impending argument, taking a sip of her wine without
thinking about it.
     Alex just rolled her eyes.  &quot;Glad we got that one established, babe.  So
back to the original question.  What is it?&quot;
     &quot;Oh.  This is just some plum wine I picked up a couple of weeks ago,&quot; Leda
replied.  &quot;Same kind of stuff we had in Susan&#39;s fortress or whatever the hell
it was.  Ami&#39;s idea, probably,&quot; she added.  &quot;I shared some of it with her the
other day and I don&#39;t remember asking Susan to pick up any for dinner since
it&#39;s not really all that common.&quot;
     &quot;Mmm,&quot; Alex purred absently.  &quot;Got any left?  OW, HEY!  Mich!&quot;
     Leda just shook her head to herself as Michelle promptly kicked Alex in
the ankle.  &quot;Kids, play nice,&quot; she sighed.
     &quot;Why aren&#39;t you listening to me?&quot; Michelle demanded.
     &quot;Damn, babe, what&#39;d you do that for?&quot;
     &quot;I told you, you&#39;re not getting drunk.&quot;
     &quot;I didn&#39;t ask to get drunk!  Why do you keep saying that?&quot;
     &quot;You had how much with dinner already?&quot;
     &quot;That was how long ago?  Settle down, babe.&quot;
     &quot;Guys, guys, c&#39;mon,&quot; Leda sighed as she rubbed her sinuses with her free
hand.  &quot;I didn&#39;t invite you over here to referee a domestic dispute, okay?  Not
that they don&#39;t keep happening in my apartment,&quot; she grumbled as she took an
absent sip of her wine.
     Alex and Michelle both visibly paused to exchange uneasy glances.  &quot;Run
that past us one more time, hon,&quot; Alex said cautiously.  &quot;What keeps happening
up in here?&quot;
     &quot;Arguments,&quot; Leda pointed out with a faint smirk.  &quot;If it&#39;s not you two,
it&#39;s Serena and Rei.  If it&#39;s not them, it&#39;s Mina and Maze.  Every now and then
it&#39;ll be Mina and Ami fussing at one another about something.  The thing that
gets me is why it keeps happening up in here instead of somewhere else, like at
Rei&#39;s temple or the denizen cathedral.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, Rei and Serena tend
to argue at the drop of a hat, current location be damned, but it just seems
that the heated ones always happen up here.  Damned annoying, you know?&quot; she
sighed before emptying her glass of wine.
     &quot;Maybe it&#39;s the eucalyptus,&quot; Alex suggested, drawing a dark look and a
light shoulder swat from Michelle.  &quot;NOW what did I do?&quot; she demanded as she
cast an equally dark look back at her lover.
     &quot;You&#39;re being mean again,&quot; Michelle pointed out in a flat tone.
     &quot;Michelle?&quot; Leda quickly interjected before Alex could open her mouth.
&quot;Not to be taking sides here, but you&#39;re not exactly running on a squeaky-clean
track record yourself at the moment.  I can probably dig up a punching bag if
you need to vent some frustration, but last I checked using your significant
other as a target isn&#39;t cool outside of a paintball arena.&quot;
     Michelle sighed quietly through her nose and cast a quick glance at Alex
before looking away, her jaw setting slightly as she slipped into a pout.  &quot;She
doesn&#39;t need to be getting drunk,&quot; she said archly.
     &quot;Nobody was offering to get her drunk tonight,&quot; Leda countered calmly.
     &quot;Tonight, eh?&quot; Alex said, seeming to perk up slightly.  &quot;You uncork a few
bottles often or something?&quot;
     Leda raised a slender eyebrow in response to the visible change in the
blonde&#39;s mood.  &quot;All things in moderation, you know,&quot; she pointed out.  &quot;And
from my point of view, that includes mercy on your liver.  Okay, so I&#39;ve got a
collection in the cabinet that could turn Happy Hour into Happy Week, but that
doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m about to get completely wasted on a whim.  Or let any of my
underage guests get drunk either,&quot; she added in a pointed tone.
     &quot;Underage?&quot; Alex prodded, giving the brunette a leery look.  &quot;That&#39;s like
the pot calling the kettle black, don&#39;t you think?  You&#39;re what, sixteen?&quot;
     &quot;And you&#39;re only seventeen,&quot; Leda countered.  &quot;Legal age is eighteen.  And
before you open your beak, it&#39;s only a misdemeanor for me if I get caught with
my own supply, but it&#39;ll be a felony if I distribute it to anyone else.  I&#39;ve
no qualms about sharing some wine with friends during dinner or the like, but
you even *think* about nipping any of my good stuff and you&#39;re dead.  Clear?&quot;
     &quot;Damn, babe, easy....&quot; Alex protested, blinking at the sudden change in
Leda&#39;s mood.  Next to her, Michelle was giving the brunette a fairly surprised
look, not entirely sure what she should have expected to hear to begin with.
&quot;So how&#39;d you get your hands on that kind of stuff to begin with?&quot;
     &quot;Money talks,&quot; Leda said in a muted tone.  &quot;That and you have to know who
to buy what from.  The wine is easy to get, since a lot of people are okay with
sharing it with their kids during dinner, but the harder stuff is a bit on the
dicey side.  Let&#39;s just say Dad had a college friend who works at a particular
booze joint somewhere out there and is willing to overlook things so long as I
don&#39;t abuse his generosity.  One bottle of this and another bottle of that once
in a metric while is fine, but it&#39;s not like I&#39;m able to walk out with a crate
of 90-proof on a whim.&quot;
     &quot;Huh,&quot; Alex mused as she traded glances with Michelle.  She sighed quietly
at the look on her face, realizing that she wasn&#39;t liable to hear the end of it
anytime soon.  &quot;Still got your panties in a bunch?&quot; she ventured.
     &quot;You don&#39;t need to be drinking,&quot; Michelle replied firmly.  &quot;And neither
does she,&quot; she added with a faintly accusing glance at Leda.
     &quot;Like I said earlier,&quot; Leda intoned in a neutral voice.  &quot;All things in
moderation.  Which, by definition, includes moderation itself.  You two going
to camp out on my balcony all night or what?  If you&#39;re looking for fresh air,
you probably might want to keep looking,&quot; she admitted with a quiet sigh.
     &quot;Nah, just seeing what sights we can,&quot; Alex sighed as she stepped into the
apartment.  She glanced back at Michelle and noticed her staring out at the
street again.  &quot;Spot another fire truck, babe?&quot;
     Michelle simply shook her head and turned away from the urban sprawl with
a quiet sigh of her own.  &quot;No, I&#39;m just.... not used to cities like this,&quot; she
confessed with a faint blush.  &quot;We certainly didn&#39;t have anything like this in
the Moon Kingdom, and the planet really wasn&#39;t all that developed back then.&quot;
     &quot;You get used to it,&quot; Leda assured her as she waited for Michelle to step
back into the apartment before closing the sliding glass door and flicking the
latch shut.  The curtains were casually drawn over the window, blocking the
casual glare of the city lights to leave the room in near-darkness.  &quot;Whoops,
hang on while I grab a light here....&quot;
     &quot;There&#39;s no need,&quot; Michelle quickly spoke up before Leda could reach for
the nearest lamp.  &quot;We&#39;re going to bed anyway.  Or at least I am,&quot; she added as
she gave Alex a gentle look.
     &quot;Already, eh?&quot; Alex spoke up, giving her a somewhat surprised look.
     &quot;I&#39;m just tired, that&#39;s all,&quot; she replied softly as she glanced away.
     &quot;Feeling alright, babe?&quot; the blonde inquired cautiously.
     Michelle gave her a gentle smile and moved over to kiss her softly.  &quot;I
just have a lot on my mind tonight, that&#39;s all,&quot; she murmured.
     &quot;Don&#39;t we all,&quot; Leda pointed out as she carried her empty wineglass into
the kitchen.  &quot;You girls want anything to drink before you call it a night?  A
conventional drink,&quot; she added in a faintly-edged tone as she looked over her
shoulder at Alex.  &quot;Water, tea, juice, milk?&quot;
     Alex just shook her head.  &quot;Nah, most of that will just keep us up.  We&#39;ll
just grab some water in a bit if that&#39;s okay with you.&quot;
     &quot;Sure, cups are in the cabinet,&quot; Leda replied with a gesture.  &quot;Kitchen&#39;s
yours if you want to make a midnight snack or anything, just use some common
sense with what you swipe.  And I&#39;m not kidding in the slightest, stay out of
my booze cabinet,&quot; she added in an audibly serious tone as she moved past them
to walk down the hallway to her bedroom.  &quot;My alarm goes off at quarter-to-six,
need to be out the door by six-thirty, hopefully that won&#39;t disturb you guys.&quot;
     &quot;We&#39;ll be fine, Leda,&quot; Michelle assured her with a smile.  &quot;And thanks for
letting us spend the night here.&quot;
     &quot;Bah, what are friends for,&quot; the voice drifted out from the far bedroom,
accompanied by a gentle rustling of fabric being removed.
     Alex simply shrugged to herself.  &quot;A shot of that 90-proof might be nice,&quot;
she said to herself as she started to untuck her blouse from her pants.  &quot;Oh,
come on, it was a joke,&quot; she sighed as she was swatted on the shoulder again.
     &quot;I&#39;m not laughing,&quot; Michelle countered darkly.  &quot;So what did you do with
the overnight bag?&quot;
     &quot;Bedroom,&quot; Alex replied as she stripped off her blouse, leaving her naked
to the waist.  &quot;You go ahead and grab the bathroom first if you need it, I&#39;m
going to take her up on that offer of some water.  Is it just me, or is the air
out there a little on the dry side?&quot; she inquired as she kicked off her shoes
and padded into the kitchen.
     Michelle simply shook her head as a delicate blush sprang to her cheeks.
It wasn&#39;t that she was embarrassed that Alex had stripped, but that she was
doing so in the middle of their host&#39;s living room.  &quot;It was a little arid,&quot;
she admitted as she started to move down the hallway.
     She reached the end of the hallway and cast a glance off to the left, just
a little curious as to what Leda&#39;s room was like.  She quickly averted her gaze
when she realized that Leda was almost completely undressed at that point, not
wanting to invade into her privacy.  Maybe it&#39;s just me, she sighed to herself
as her blush deepened, all too aware of Susan&#39;s tendency to change clothing in
the presence of others as if it didn&#39;t matter.
     Still, she thought to herself as she cast a studious glance around the
guest room that she and Alex would be borrowing, this isn&#39;t really all that bad
of a place.  It&#39;ll take a lot more getting used to than I had thought it would,
but maybe Alex and I can make our home in this city after all.  I wonder what
Susan would think? she mused as she quickly unpacked her bag of toiletries and
carried them into the bathroom to prepare for bed.
     She&#39;ll probably say the change of pace would be good for us, she thought
with a mental sigh as she flipped on the bathroom light and promptly blinded
herself for a few moments.  Ow.... but still, she wondered as she waited for
her vision to refocus, there has been an awful lot of changes in our lives as
of late, and I&#39;m not entirely sure it&#39;s all for the better.  Serena becoming an
angel seems to be, but what about everything else?  Darian as the Negaverse&#39;s
crown prince?  Alex and I having to pretend to be citizens to live ordinary
lives on the surface?  And just what was Susan talking about the other day with
this whole Chosen One thing?
     She paused as she saw her reflection in the mirror, blinking in surprise
as there was the briefest of sensations of seeing someone else entirely within.
Hmm? she thought as she peered at the glass, half-expecting it to ripple like
her Soul Mirror does when it reveals a true reflection.  She saw only herself
looking back at her with a faintly confused look, causing her to sigh quietly
in resignation.
     &quot;Too many doubts,&quot; she muttered to herself.  &quot;We&#39;ll be fine,&quot; she insisted
to her reflection, knowing it was a silly gesture but somehow feeling just a
tiny bit better about it anyway.  &quot;We always have been, and as long as we have
the Princess on our side, we always will be.&quot;
     She visibly paused again as the faintest of tingles ran through her,
causing her to poke her head out of the bathroom to look around.  She could
hear motion coming from both directions, Leda moving around in her bedroom and
Alex casually checking out the contents of the refrigerator.  Relax, she told
herself with a muted sigh, casting only the barest of glances towards the
curtained window that led to the balcony and the rest of the outside world.
     &quot;You need to relax,&quot; she muttered to her reflection after returning her
focus to getting ready for bed.  &quot;Too much more of this and you&#39;ll wind up
talking to yourself....&quot;

                                     EPILOGUE

     The succubus stood alone on the building roof, the dark coloring of her
suit combining with her equally dark skin to render her all but invisible in
the faded twilight.  Her wings were neatly folded behind her like a canopy,
further adding to the concealment that wasn&#39;t truly necessary at this point.
     &quot;This should be interesting,&quot; she quietly said to the open air.
     &lt;You will not take any action tonight,&gt; a truly dark voice said in a muted
tone, making the air around her body resonate slightly.  It was a sensation she
had come to savor, often prodding her master into speaking simply to experience
that most unusual of feelings.
     &quot;How much longer would you have me wait?&quot; she protested with a pout that
twisted her features into a mien that some men would have found more than a
little appealing.  &quot;I&#39;m ready to take them on.&quot;
     &lt;I doubt that you are,&gt; the voice countered ominously.  &lt;And I would not
have you disrupt the threads before they are firmly woven into the tapestry.
Two have already been laid down, and only when the third joins them will you
be allowed to act freely.  Time itself has favored me, and I would not have
even a single grain of sand in the hourglass disturbed ahead of schedule.&gt;
     The succubus sighed quietly and absently fluttered her wings.  &quot;At least
let me meet them first,&quot; she pleaded.  &quot;Just to get an idea of what they are
like.  You know, like the others.&quot;
     &lt;No, the time is not yet ripe.  I forbid it.&gt;
     &quot;So you would make me hungry by bringing me out here, only to leave me to
starve in the cold darkness?&quot; she murmured, casting another wistful glance out
to the horizon to the east.  &quot;You are too cruel to your servant, master.&quot;
     &lt;And your ignorance is disturbing,&gt; it countered, seeming to make the very
building shake briefly as if it had been caught in a stiff gust of wind.  &lt;You
do not fully understand what you are up against.  Twice already your presence
has been betrayed to them, and already tonight you were espied by that gift of
unawareness.  Had you met earlier you would have been betrayed a third time.
Ignorance is a powerful ally, but once dispelled it is you who will fall prey
to the weakness.  Remember that.&gt;
     &quot;The Guardian will underestimate me,&quot; she replied.  &quot;We both know that.&quot;
     &lt;Perhaps I have failed somehow in your genesis,&gt; the voice rumbled in a
low tone, causing her to blink hard as her blood chilled.  &lt;That may account
for the sudden weakness of your mind.&gt;
     &quot;Master....&quot; she said in a faintly trembling tone.
     &lt;You are a fool to think she would make such a trivial mistake.  She is
not a fledgling recruit thrust onto a field of battle by necessity, but rather
she is a battle-hardened veteran and I daresay a general in her own right.  If
your paths were to cross now I would not care to wager on the odds of your
continued survival.&gt;
     It took the succubus a moment to frame her reply to the unexpectedly harsh
words echoing in the otherwise still air around her.  &quot;Am I not your servant,
master?&quot; she spoke up carefully.  &quot;Is your kiss not upon my wretched soul?  Do
I not embody an echo of your greatness, a fragment of your power?  Surely that
is enough to overcome a mere Guardian.&quot;
     &lt;A &#39;mere&#39; Guardian would indeed fall before you like the harvest wheat to
the reaving blade,&gt; it pointed out in a flat rumble.  &lt;But that one is not to
be underestimated.  Of the five who can break the binding threads of all that
I have laid out, she alone can directly unravel the tapestry completely if she
becomes aware of the cloth.  I have said this before, my meager servant, to
battle her is to battle against the power of Hell itself.  Do NOT presume that
she can be taken in battle as easily as a rook can take a pawn, for while she
acts as neither king nor queen she still commands the board as the most potent
of threats.  Remember that.&gt;
     &quot;And what of this one?&quot; she murmured as she absently gestured to the floor
beneath her dark boots.
     &lt;A bishop,&gt; it replied calmly.  &lt;A strategic threat like the others, one
that cannot be readily ignored, but yet limited in her moves.  You may take her
at your leisure once the board has been cleared of resistance, but again....
you will not be allowed to act freely until all is ready.  Patience.&gt;
     &quot;Again, you tease me, my cruel master,&quot; she purred as she absently licked
her lips.  &quot;We met earlier, she and I, and for a moment I would have believed
that you had already kissed her soul as well.&quot;
     &lt;She is human,&gt; the voice replied simply.  &lt;The essence of chaos resides
in them all, some are merely more in touch with it than others.  Her life is
essentially half-played out already, and the curtain will fall on the drama of
her act long before the others.  A comedy and a tragedy at the same time, and
ironic beyond words that in the deepest recesses of her heart she yearns for no
greater an epitaph.  Let her fate be a lesson to you.... be careful indeed what
you hunger for, as you just might receive your fill of your desires.&gt;
     A coy smile brushed her lips as she gently flexed the dark canopy of her
demonic wings.  &quot;You know what I hunger for, master,&quot; she purred.
     &lt;And a short, violent demise is all you will find served at the table if
you persist in foolishness and folly,&gt; the voice replied darkly.  &lt;Your power
is great, and my power makes you greater still, but even that power pales in
comparison to the unified might of many against one.  Your time will come, but
you must be patient until then.&gt;
     She resisted the urge to roll her eyes, knowing that would only provoke a
painful rebuke, and settled instead for silently exhaling through her nose.
&quot;At least let me act the guise,&quot; she pleaded quietly.  &quot;Allow me to scout the
terrain first so I know what to expect.  Or would you send an army into battle
on an unknown field?&quot;
     &lt;The fields of battle are already known,&gt; it pointed out.
     &quot;Not to me,&quot; she retorted tartly as she glanced over her shoulder at the
heavy yet otherwise empty air.  &quot;My vision is vast, being mere mirrors of your
own sight, but even that has its limits.  Sight alone is not enough, as a wise
general would have the grass smelled beforehand to see if it has been tainted
by poison or worse.&quot;
     A very faint chuckle surrounded her, the gentle reverberations seeming to
caress her sensitive skin and wings.  &lt;Most would not have that sort of luxury,
and fewer still would bother if a herd had roamed there previously, but I shall
acknowledge your point as having some validity in theory if not in practice.
Very well then, scout your path if you wish, but I will warn you now that you
will not be as invisible as you believe yourself to be.&gt;
     She threw herself into the air in an instant, soaring high up into the
thin nocturnal clouds with a powerful snap of her wings that seemed to leave a
crackle of energy in their wake.  She continued to gain altitude until she was
safely hidden by the clouds, pausing only for a moment to regain her bearings
before heading west towards the center of the city.
     The aerial journey only lasted a handful of seconds before she settled
into a cautious glide, allowing gravity to pull her out of the clouds at a
steady rate.  She continued to descend at a moderate pace before she abruptly
folded her wings against her back, allowing her to plummet straight down like
a rock towards the roof of a skyscraper.  Her wings snapped out at the last
moment to act as air-brakes, briefly scattering a prismatic shower of electric
sparkles in all directions amid a sharp crack of hyper-compressed air that was
loud enough to rattle a few nearby windows.
     Her toes had barely touched the rooftop when she was suddenly flattened
against the ground by a powerful force.  &quot;Master!&quot; she gasped as the pressure
threatened to implode her chest, leaving her utterly breathless.
     &lt;Fool!&gt; the disembodied voice hissed, causing the building to rumble very
slightly.  &lt;They can sense your energies even from a distance.  Flaunt it and
they will surely find you, and I.... do not.... tolerate.... failure.&gt;
     She waited until the compressive force had lifted before trying to draw in
enough breath to respond.  &quot;Your power inside me is great, my master,&quot; she
simpered quietly as she gingerly sat up.  &quot;Sometimes too great for me to keep
full control of.&quot;
     &lt;Oh, is it now?&gt; it replied, the voice audibly changing pitch.  &lt;If you
are not able to wield it with absolute control, then perhaps I would be best
served by another....&gt;
     &quot;Master, please,&quot; she breathed as she rested on her knees, looking up at
the darkened sky with a plaintive expression.  &quot;You know I live only to serve
you, that all I do is with your desires in my heart and your power singing in
my very being.  The joy of being yours is enough to overwhelm at times, and I
know how important this task is for you.  Please, forgive your humble slave for
her eagerness to please you....&quot;
     &lt;You would please me the greatest by being careful,&gt; it replied using a
tone she rarely heard from it.  &lt;One misstep could cost me dearly, perhaps even
enough to ruin all that I have worked for.  The Rules bind me and prevent me
from acting directly, and so I must rely on you to be the hand that I shall
reshape all of Creation with.  You were selected above all others for a reason,
Erebeth, as you held the greatest promise for me.  Restrain your enthusiasm and
control your emotions, lest they control you in turn.&gt;
     &quot;Yes, master,&quot; she murmured as she briefly closed her eyes and tried to
enter a meditative state.  She remained motionless for several moments as she
sought to quell the burning desires within her, betrayed only by the steady
rise and fall of her shapely chest as she breathed.  &quot;Oh?&quot; she suddenly blurted
out as she opened her eyes, blinking hard before turning to peer over the edge
of the building to the city below.
     &lt;Sensed her, have you?&gt; the voice observed in a faintly amused tone.  &lt;Now
do you see what you can discern with a cleared mind and a steady grip on your
own essence of chaos?&gt;
     &quot;Interesting,&quot; she said quietly to herself as she examined the demonic
echo next to her current quarry.  &quot;You&#39;re right, master, I probably wouldn&#39;t
have sensed her until I was much closer.&quot;
     &lt;Close enough to be sensed yourself if she were paying attention,&gt; it
added in a satisfied tone.  &lt;Bear that in mind, as there are others with such
gifts of otherworldly senses.&gt;
     &quot;Yes, I know,&quot; she murmured absently as she glanced up towards a part of
the city that she could readily feel even from her vantage point several miles
away.  &quot;And what of this one?&quot; she added as she refocused on the small cluster
of apartment towers a couple of blocks away.
     &lt;The white king,&gt; the voice replied in a neutral tone.  &lt;He has the power
to destroy my threads, yet it is not within him to do so.  You will leave him
alone and not strike at him under any circumstances, for to do so would put my
plan in great peril.  What&#39;s more, to place him into check would be to rally
the others to his defense, and you would be well-advised not to underestimate
the potency of a castle-defense move.  The white queen will be neutralized in
the opening gambit, but that will not leave him overly exposed.  The others
will see to that,&gt; he assured her.  &lt;You will allow them to protect him, am I
understood?&gt;
     She simply nodded in understanding.  &quot;Understood, my master.  And what of
the other bishop?&quot; she mused as she turned again to face the core part of the
city that figuratively glowed on her spiritual senses.
     &lt;A grave threat if you leave yourself exposed,&gt; it explained.  &lt;If your
dark rival is the white queen&#39;s left hand, then she is the right.  She will be
among those defending the white king, however, once the castle-defense becomes
invoked.  If your greatest danger is not presented by the knight, then it will
stem from her.  Watch both with great care.  Remain here,&gt; it warned ominously
as she spread her wings as if to take flight again.
     &quot;I thought I was allowed to scout further,&quot; she complained, giving the air
a faintly upset look as she flutterd her wings before folding them against her
back.
     &lt;Avoid her as long as possible,&gt; it warned.  &lt;The strength and power of
her elemental core is second to none, not even to the white queen.  You were
betrayed to her earlier, though the shroud of ignorance was sufficient to keep
her blinded.  For the moment,&gt; it added darkly.  &lt;Once her eyes are opened to
your mere existence, there will be precious few places in this realm capable of
hiding you from her watchful gaze.&gt;
     A weary sigh drifted up from her chest as she weighed the implications and
found them to be burdensome.  &quot;Very well, master, I shall not tempt her.  Will
I be able to take her later?&quot;
     &lt;Should the board be sufficiently cleared and the three threads of fate
united as one within the tapestry, she will be yours to do with as you please,&gt;
it said in a solemn tone.  &lt;But do not start savoring your victory just yet,
my eager servant, there is much that will take place first and not even I am
able to influence every single grain in the hourglass.  Nor, for that matter,
will you,&gt; the heavy echo said in a clear tone of warning.
     The succubus remained quiet for a number of moments, absently glancing
down to where she could still sense the demonic echo before refocusing further
to the west.  &quot;I have met both your white queen and her dark rook,&quot; she finally
said, carefully straining her senses outward to try to detect the tell-tale
energy signatures of either woman.  &quot;Powerful Guardians indeed, but yet....&quot;
     &lt;Do not worry about them,&gt; the inhuman voice assured her.  &lt;Both will be
neutralized and removed from play, though you will still need to be on guard
while in their presence.  Unless you fail me utterly, neither will be able to
pierce the shroud of ignorance until it is far too late.&gt;
     She sighed quietly at his words, letting her shoulders and her wings droop
to briefly expose her emotions.  &quot;Master, why do you taunt me so?&quot; she pleaded
with an almost tearful expression.  &quot;I will not fail you.&quot;
     &lt;Famous last words,&gt; it observed in an openly bemused tone.
     &quot;You are cruel!&quot; she protested with a pout.  &quot;Have I not trained for this
too hard, have I not lived for you for too long, to fail you now?&quot;
     &lt;Were success so certain, my wily servant, I would have ended this some
time ago,&gt; it pointed out.  &lt;Irksome as the thought is, not even I am left a
virgin once enveloped in failure&#39;s bitter embrace.  Twice before my plans have
failed due to simple and unforseen events, and for all my precautions I am all
too aware that I may yet endure that embrace a third time.  You call me cruel,
but I am simply being cautious in my words and actions.  The field is almost
ripe, and the smell of the fruits of success still hanging from the vine teases
me more than you can imagine.  But only when it is time for the harvest will
that sweetest of tastes be mine, the nectars of triumph and victory, and not
even I can influence the sands of Time to hasten the Moment along her steady
path.  Patience it must be until the hour arrives of its own accord.&gt;
     She simply bowed her head, quietly savoring the vibration along her wings
caused by her master&#39;s voice.  &quot;At least let me visit the final battlefield,
master,&quot; she urged quietly.
     &lt;I forbid it,&gt; it countered quietly.  &lt;Even from this distance you can be
espied, and I suspect you already have been.  Look past your eyes, Erebeth.
Use sight beyond sight, sense beyond sense, and truly see the dangers you are
already in as you stand here before me.&gt;
     The succubus cast a slightly uneasy look at the air around her before she
took a deep breath and tapped the onyx gemstone imbedded in the center of her
golden tiara.  A band of kaleidoscopic colors washed across her face for a few
moments before solidifying into a dark visor.  The tinted plastic immediately
began to light up as the tiny sensor unit she had just touched began to scan
her surroundings, letting her see energy emissions that her normal vision and
spiritual senses weren&#39;t able to readily detect.
     &quot;Oh.... my,&quot; she breathed as she glanced up at a beam of dark green light
that passed over her head with maybe four inches to spare.  It took the display
a moment to categorize the energy signature as being a simple satellite uplink
and that she was in no danger of bodily harm despite the fact that the energy
frequency was almost in the microwave band.
     &lt;Three of the Guardians can see such things at their leisure,&gt; the voice
warned her quietly, &lt;Yet only the dark rook is truly aware of her ability to do
so at any time.  Such sight was used before to detect a surprise visitor, and
it was not with her own eyes that contact was made.  Behold....&gt;
     She frowned as she looked off to the west towards the edge of the city,
the multitude of criss-crossing beams of light fading in and out as her sensor
cycled through the frequencies.  She blinked as the scanner locked onto a very
particular energy signature, showing up on her visor as a large hemisphere of
prismatic blue energy accompanied by thin lances of dark red that swept around
at random.  A thick curtain of green radiated out at an angle that moved in a
slow circle at a steady pace, sweeping the horizon like....
     &quot;Radar,&quot; she spoke up, her tone turning to one of dread.
     &lt;Indeed,&gt; her master spoke up with a faint chuckle that was only partially
amused.  &lt;Doppler radar is used mostly for weather, although it can serve to
illuminate a moving target just as readily.  Had you approached, you would have
been detected almost immediately.  Observe how far it plays out,&gt; it added as
the sweep passed over them.  The energy signature was extremely thin and pale
at this distance, appearing as little more than a faint green glow on her
visor, but it was more than enough to suggest that it could still pick up her
presence in mid-air.
     &quot;Great,&quot; she murmured to herself, suddenly no longer sounding eager for
her moment in the proverbial spotlight.
     &lt;I sense you have lost your appetite, my devoted disciple,&gt; it spoke up.
&lt;Do you no longer hunger for the taste of triumph and victory?&gt;
     She raised a raven-colored eyebrow in response.  &quot;Forgive you most meager
minion, my master,&quot; she replied carefully, &quot;But have you not advised patience
for the present?  I will admit that.... perhaps my words earlier were indeed a
bit.... rash, but now I am aware of my oversights thanks to your guidance.  I
will not fail you, master,&quot; she added with a soft purr and a flexing of her
wings.  &quot;They will come to fear your name soon enough.&quot;
     &lt;Soon indeed,&gt; the unholy voice promised.  &lt;Study what you will from this
vantage point, but you will venture no closer to any of them tonight.  Return
once you are finished and prepare for a new day.&gt;
     &quot;Mmmmm,&quot; she replied, still using a silken purr.  &quot;And what will the new
day bring us, my master?&quot;
     &lt;One step closer, that is all,&gt; it mused.  &lt;Time sets her own pace, as she
has since the beginning, and none can hasten her path.  But by the same token,
my eager Erebeth, neither does she wait for anyone, mortal or divine.&gt;
     She almost shivered as there was the faintest of sensations along her
wings, as if she were being caressed by a hidden hand, before the air seemed to
become ever so slightly lighter and easier to breathe.  She knew then that her
master had departed, leaving her to her own devices in the city.
     &quot;Soon,&quot; she whispered to the open air, casting one final look towards the
distant west before reaching up to shut off her virtual visor.  The display
became blank as it was powered down, quickly disintegrating into another band
of kaleidoscopic energy that promptly faded away.
     She walked over to the edge of the building, casting a glance down towards
the apartment towers as she stretched her wings out to their full span.  &quot;Soon,
my white king,&quot; she purred as she licked her lips.  &quot;Soon you and the others
will bow before my might.  Behold my true form and despair!&quot; she said loudly,
snapping her wings around her hard enough to make the very air shiver as the
gesture sent prismatic sparks of energy everywhere. &quot;For I.... am Chaos!&quot;
     There was the the briefest of pulses of energy around her as the threads
of dimensional energy were woven and inverted, lasting just long enough to
illuminate the golden brooch nestled in the center of her jet-black chest bow
before the Sailor Scout vanished entirely from the mortal plane.
