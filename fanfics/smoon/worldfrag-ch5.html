<h1>World in Fragments (part 5 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/worldfrag-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&#147;Wanna swim!&#148; Hotaru crawled over to her daddy and laughed happily.

She wore her dark green swim suit and hold a big swimming ball in her 
hands. Her cheeks were redden and her mouth was brown. She just ate a 
chocolate ice cream and shared it with her whole body. Her arms and 
her legs were also covered with brown spots. The dark hairs flew over 
her shoulders and wind played with some strands. It was a very hot 
summer&#146;s day. After a rainy May the weather got better and better and 
the meteorologist promised a long and very warm summer.

&#147;Okay.&#148; Haruka took her daughter and her arms and needed two tries 
until she stood up. There were only two weeks left until the birth and 
she felt like a big walrus. She wore a long, wide dark shirt instead 
of her own swimming suit. It simply didn&#146;t fit anymore. Nothing of her 
whole clothes didn&#146;t fit anymore. Now she often wore wide shirts and 
trousers that were adjustable. One week ago she searched for something 
in her wardrobe and looked sceptically at her red racing suit. 
Wondering how she had ever been so slim to get into it. Slowly the 
senshi of the wind went over to the swimming pool. She entered it at 
the side that was very low. So that Hotaru could stand in the water 
without being in danger of drowning. Although the little girl wasn&#146;t 
afraid of it. Every time her mama took her into the house swimming 
pool she laughed happily and threw the water high in the air. As she 
did this time, too and soon her black hairs were wet.

&#147;Are you sure that she doesn&#146;t carry twins?&#148; asked Ami and put her 
thick book away. She picked up her sun glasses and watched over to the 
young car racer who sat down at the rim and looked with a loving 
expression on her face down at her daughter. Hotaru ran through the 
water, caught her ball and threw it up at her daddy. Haruka threw it 
back very carefully. The little girl clapped in her hands each time 
she was able to catch it again.

&#147;Hai. Although she often says that she feels like a balloon.&#148; Michiru 
corrected her summer hat and giggled as she saw how Hotaru tried to 
splash her daddy and Haruka winced away quickly. She didn&#146;t want to 
get wet. So everyone could see her state of body. As if anybody could 
have overseen it.

&#147;I can imagine.&#148; Ami giggled, too and rolled her eyes as two shadows 
run by.

&quot;The last one in the water is a lazy chicken!&#148; screamed Minako and her 
yellow swim suit sparkled in the bright sun. Rei followed her and soon 
they shouted out how cold it was by splashing each other. It was such 
a nice Saturday afternoon and they all decided to go to the swimming 
pool.

&#147;Hey, wait for me!&#148; Usagi got to her feet and stumbled over her own 
shoes. She almost hit the ground but her boyfriend hold her back. 
Together the run into the water and soon there was a big water battle. 
And it wasn&#146;t sure who would win it.

&#147;Do you know the gender of the baby?&#148; Ami yawned and stretched her 
arms. It had been a hard week with a lot of tests to do in school. She 
learned hard for getting only good notes. For having better chances to 
become a doctor one day.

&#147;Hai, but Haruka doesn&#146;t. She doesn&#146;t want to know it.&#148; Michiru&#146;s 
smile faded slightly but brightened up as she heard Makoto scolding an 
innocent looking Chibiusa.

&#147;Where&#146;s the sandwich? I knew I had two cheese sandwiches and now 
there&#146;s only one left!&#148; The future Princess of Crystal Tokyo only 
smiled and chewed very slowly. Then she turned around to play with 
Hotaru, too. Her pink swim suit fitted perfectly to her hairs and her 
pink eyes shone happily as she entered the water, took her best friend 
in her arms and swirled around with her. Hotaru laughed high and more 
water splashed around.

&#147;I see.&#148; Ami nodded understanding but then she looked curiously at the 
older woman next to her. &#147;And what is it? Please, Michiru! I know 
we&#146;ll all know in about two weeks but I am so curious about it.&#148; She 
said and blushed deeply. The young violinist only giggled, then laid 
back at the huge blanket and looked up at the cloudless sky above.

&#147;Guess we&#146;ll have to buy another race car one day.&#148; She whispered and 
swallowed hard.

As long as Haruka isn&#146;t so crazy and gives it away.

They didn&#146;t talk about that topic during the past three months and 
since that afternoon with Usagi Haruka didn&#146;t visit any of those 
couples again. She went to all appointments and often met her racer&#146;s 
team. To see how they were doing in the World&#146;s Championship. And to 
give them some advice.

She often watched Michiru playing the violin at some spring concerts 
and she was a loving daddy to Hotaru.

I am so glad that Himme-chan&#146;s too small to know what happens with her 
daddy. That she&#146;s too small to understand that she&#146;ll have a brother 
in two weeks. And maybe that she will loose him...

Michiru blinked her tears away and smiled a sad smile. She avoided the 
topic of adoption and also Haruka slowly changed her habit. They took 
several photos of Haruka&#146;s arched belly and Michiru loved to see the 
sparkle in her lover&#146;s eyes each time the baby kicked wildly around.

Maybe she didn&#146;t change her mind during the past months. 

The young violinist smiled even more as she remembered the small toy 
she once discovered in the cradle that stood &#150; still untouched &#150; near 
the TV set. It was a violet mouse with shinning eyes, big ears and 
huge feet. Michiru knew that only one person could have bought it &#150; 
for their child.

&#147;Great!&#148; was all Ami could say. She glanced again over to the pregnant 
woman, then she turned her head and looked at Makoto who still 
observed their picnic basket. &#147;Let&#146;s go into the water, Mako-chan. 
It&#146;s too hot for sitting outside and it&#146;s too early for lunch.&#148; She 
declared, grabbed Makoto&#146;s hands and together they run into the fresh 
water and joined the rest of the Sailor Team in the great water battle 
near the slide. Usagi&#146;s screams could be heard all over the swimming 
pool.

&#147;And, what is it doing?&#148; Michiru sat down behind her lover and 
embraced her. Chibiusa threw the ball again and Hotaru screamed exited 
as she ran through the low water to catch it. She stumbled, fell into 
the water and stood up again &#150; wet all over. But there was a happy 
smile on her face as she took the water ball and threw it back at her 
best friend.

&#147;Sleeping, I guess. It&#146;s too hot.&#148; Answered Haruka, bowed her head and 
closed her eyes as the young violinist started to massage her 
shoulders. Since her belly became bigger and bigger her back often 
hurt. Michiru spend a lot of hours massaging Haruka who laid silently 
on their wide bed. The senshi of the wide ocean enjoyed those hours 
very much. As she enjoyed the hours she took a long shower with Haruka 
and washed slowly the arched belly, feeling the child under her 
caressing hands. Sometimes Haruka&#146;s hormones were playing crazy and 
although she kept strong when she was together with the other senshi 
and although no one ever saw her crying but her Michiru and only for 
one single time their future Queen, Michiru knew how hard it was for 
her lover. The nightmares were still haunting her down. Not as often 
as they had during the winter but there were some nights she spend 
holding her sobbing Haruka tight in her arms. Rocking her for hours. 
Trying to calm her down. Her hormones let grow her feelings stronger. 
Her happiness and her luck, but also her sadness and her despair. It&#146;s 
okay. She can cry as much as she wants. As long as she&#146;s able to smile 
again afterwards. Michiru&#146;s hands slipped under the wide black shirt 
and Haruka gasped for breathe.

&#147;Not now. We&#146;re in public.&#148; She said and wanted to put those soft 
hands away. But Michiru was faster. For the first time in her whole 
life she was faster than the senshi of the wind. And stronger. She 
didn&#146;t misuse that strange power she suddenly got. Only sometimes. 
Like now.

&#147;Hai, now. We&#146;re in love, can&#146;t you remember?&#148; Michiru giggled and 
stroke over the arched belly under the wide shirt. There was no 
kicking yet. Certainly the child was sleeping now. Deep and tight. In 
her lover&#146;s womb.

&#147;And we&#146;re pregnant.&#148;

Haruka didn&#146;t respond anything. She just sat there, hearing her 
daughter&#146;s happy laughter, feeling her lover&#146;s soft hands caressing 
her body. Again she remembered the words once a young man had said to 
her. With a sad look in his light green eyes.

He&#146;s right. We should be grateful for the things we have.

Haruka gasped as she felt those soft hands on her breasts. There were 
bigger now and sometimes she asked herself how she could ever hide 
them behind her race track. How anybody could ever thought about her 
as a man. They were full of milk and sometimes she felt herself like a 
cow. Michiru only giggled when she told her and teased her a little 
bit around.

Haruka bit on her lower lip and felt how she became exited. First she 
had been scared to love her Michi-chan. She thought that she would 
never be able to love her with her body after the rude man hurt her so 
much. And she had been unsure if Michiru would like her arched belly. 
But the young violinist did.

The young car racer opened her eyes as she felt cool water on her 
naked legs. She saw into several grinning faces and couldn&#146;t help but 
to blush.

&#147;You&#146;ll have enough time for that later.&#148; Declared Minako with a 
wicked grin on her face. &#147;Now it&#146;s time for party.&#148; She looked around 
and the other agreed. Then they splashed the two outer senshi with all 
their forces. Even Setsuna who had swam silently though the swimming 
pool joined them and soon Haruka and Michiru sat at the rim &#150; wet all 
over. Hotaru and Chibiusa laughed loudly and then the water battle got 
even worse. Harder.

And funnier.

Haruka felt how her lover moved into the water and took her with her. 
The young car racer didn&#146;t defend &#150; even if the cloths pasted now to 
her belly and didn&#146;t hide anything any longer. The other senshi were 
nice to her and they had a great afternoon. Even if Usagi almost fell 
from the slide and cried until her Mamoru bought her some sweets &#150; 
which she had to share with Chibiusa who shared her prey with Hotaru. 
Even if Minako almost drown at the attempt to get Ami under the 
surface &#150; but the water&#146;s senshi was simply faster than her. Even if 
Rei almost burned one of Makoto&#146;s sandwiches because she wanted to 
have her cheese melt.

I changed my opinion so often during the past months. Haruka smiled as 
Michiru helped her down the blanket, wrapped a towel around her wet 
body and fought with Usagi for something to eat. Makoto scolded them 
both but all she earned where wicked grins and she screamed out loud 
when they tickled her until they got what they wanted. There&#146;re only 
two weeks left to make up my mind.

Haruka sighed slightly and took her daughter in her arms who climbed 
on her lap and enjoyed it to get dried by her daddy. 

Secretly in her heart Haruka knew how she would decide. But she didn&#146;t 
tell it to Michiru because she wasn&#146;t really sure yet. And she didn&#146;t 
admit it to herself.

***

&#147;Now the basket is almost light.&#148; Declared Makoto and her still wet 
plaid swirled through the air as she turned back to her friends who 
followed her. Mamoru wear the huge blanket in the one hand and some 
bags in the other one. Michiru wore some more bags. They came to the 
swimming pool by food. There was a huge park they had to walk through 
to the next bus station and they enjoyed the walk. Over sandy ways, 
through the shadows of huge, green trees beneath. Although it was late 
at evening the sun still shone. Her light got weaker and it was 
pleasant cool outside. Fresh wind played with their summer clothes and 
Minako started to sung. Soon they accompanied her and Ami&#146;s book fell 
on the ground as the senshi of love grabbed her hands and danced 
around with her. Rei laughed and almost cried of laughing, because 
they both danced into Usagi who couldn&#146;t hold her balance anymore. She 
seized on the other senshi and the three fell down on the ground.

A big, lively family.

Haruka smiled and took her daughter&#146;s hand into her own one. Hotaru 
insisted to walk but Haruka would carry her when she&#146;d got to know 
that the little girl was too tired to walk anymore. Chibiusa ran over 
the sandy way and collected some flowers she gave to every one &#150; but 
her future mother. Usagi scolded her and soon there was another loving 
argument. After they calmed down they all decided to go to a nice 
Italian caf&eacute; they all liked very much to eat an ice cream. Tomorrow 
was Sunday and they all had enough time to get enough sleep to survive 
the next week at school, at university, at library or at stage.

&#147;Everything alright?&#148; Michiru looked up at Haruka who supported her 
arched belly with her free hand. The taller woman turned her head and 
smiled at her. It was a honest, happy smile that moved Michiru&#146;s 
heart. She raised her hand and ran it through short blonde hairs that 
felt like velvet. They were still a little bit wet and looked wet.

My tomboy!

&#147;Hai. It heard something of ice cream and now it wants one.&#148; Declared 
Haruka and slowed down a little bit. To walk could be exhausting for 
her. For the strongest of all senshi who was as fast as the wind. The 
other mentioned it and got slower, too. Only Rei and Usagi speed up. 
Because they were haunting each other again.

Rei simply couldn&#146;t oppress a cynic word and Usagi was now very angry 
with her. But their giggles betrayed their real feeling, their deep 
friendship.

&#147;It&#146;s kicking around very wildly now.&#148; Haruka took Michiru&#146;s free hand 
and hold it up to her belly. Michiru smiled as she felt the kicking 
under the skin. Then she suddenly put her bags down and gave her lover 
a tenderly kiss.

&#147;You baka!&#148;

&#147;Rei, you can&#146;t...!&#148;

The voices of the other died slowly away. They knew when it was time 
to leave the couple alone and so they decided to go and to wait at the 
next bend.

&#147;I love you, Michi-chan.&#148; Declared Haruka and blushed deeply. Michiru 
gave her another loving kiss and smiled up at her pregnant lover.

&#147;I love you, too, Ruka.&#148; She whispered.

&#147;Love you!&#148; shouted Hotaru and smiled happily as they both looked down 
at her. They wanted to say anything more as the shadow stepped out of 
the shadows. The rushes of the leaves increased and the wind got 
wilder.

Some birds flew screaming into the dawning sky.

&#147;Hi, beauty.&#148; Said a low voice and someone grabbed Michiru&#146;s right arm 
and pulled her away from her lover. 

She turned around. Too surprised to say anything. Too surprised to 
defend herself. &#147;Do you wanna come with me?&#148; She made a face as she 
could smell the alcohol and the sweat. The man was taller than her and 
certainly he was stronger. His brown hairs were fatty and he didn&#146;t 
shave for a long time. He smiled a wicked grin and she started 
automatically to freeze. Then she was able to move again.

&#147;Leave me in piece!&#148; she shouted and kicked him. He didn&#146;t expect it 
and let her go. But not for long, she could see the sparkling in his 
dark eyes.

&#147;Go or I&#146;ll call the police.&#148; She said determined and searched for her 
handy while she stepped back to her lover.

Haruka didn&#146;t respond anything. She only took her daughter in her arms 
and stared at the man with an empty face. But her dark green eyes 
burned. They were full: Full of despair. Full of disgust. Full of 
hate.

The man came nearer again while Michiru dialled a number. But he 
slammed it out of her hand and tried to get her in his arms again.

Where the hell are the other senshi?

Michiru shook her head but at the next moment Haruka stepped 
protectively between her and the man.

&#147;Didn&#146;t you hear what she said? Leave her in piece!&#148; she declared with 
an icy voice that didn&#146;t seem to belong to her anymore. It sounded 
strange in her own ears and she bit hard on her lower lip. She wanted 
to scream. To shout. But she knew that it wouldn&#146;t change anything.

&#147;YOU!&#148; The man blinked and looked at her. Then there was another 
expression in his face. It wasn&#146;t greedy anymore. It was simply 
annoyed &#150; and surprised. Shocked he looked at her arched belly and 
shook his head.

&#147;Why didn&#146;t you abort it, you silly brat?&#148; he declared and laughed a 
rude laugh that were haunting the young car racer down. Every night in 
her nightmares. Every day when she was awake and felt how the child 
moved inside her body.

Not knowing how she should love it &#150; after all what happened.

&#147;Don&#146;t expect that I&#146;ll pay for it, you whore. I believe you slept 
with so many men, I am not the father.&#148; He shouted and raised his hand 
to beat her. Haruka didn&#146;t move. She simply stood there, looking at 
him with a look in her eyes that made him shiver. That drove him 
crazy.

&#147;DEEP SUBMERGE!!!&#148;

A huge blue planet hit the man and he flew several meters before he 
landed hard on the grass. A young woman in a sexy uniform stood over 
him. Her deep blue eyes shone down at him and suddenly he was sure 
that she would kill him. Maybe he was very strong but suddenly he knew 
that she was stronger than him.

&#147;You aren&#146;t it&#146;s father!&#148; declared the senshi of the wide ocean and 
grabbed his collar. He seemed to be weightless as she pulled him on 
his feet and pushed him against a tree&#146;s trunk. &#147;You asshole! Can you 
imagine how much you hurt her?&#148; screamed Michiru and tears were 
running down her cheeks. She slammed him right into the face, right 
into his stomach. He groaned but she didn&#146;t mention it.

&#147;You asshole! I&#146;ll kill you for what you&#146;ve done to my Ruka!&#148; she 
raised her knee and he groaned even more as she kicked him between his 
legs. He wanted to go on his knees but she hold him up. &#147;I&#146;ll kill you 
slowly and bit by bit. You&#146;ll be happy to be in hell. Because the 
devil is friendly compared with my revenge!&#148; She pushed him against at 
the trunk and he tried to defend himself. But he couldn&#146;t. She was too 
strong. Too desperate.

Michiru didn&#146;t see him. She didn&#146;t see his blood, didn&#146;t hear his 
groans. Didn&#146;t mention that she was really killing him. All she 
remembered was her Ruka how she sat down in the shower, staring afraid 
into nothing. How she broke down sobbing when she got to know that the 
AIDS test was negative. How she cried for the first time in her arms 
of her girlfriend after they made love. How she sat at the snow 
covered beach telling her that she had been a coward. That she 
couldn&#146;t abort the child. How she became more and more desperate after 
every meeting she had with potential parents for her child. How she 
yelled at her because of the cradle &#150; and bought the tiny toy mouse 
some days later. How she hold her hands towards her arched belly and 
smiled with tears in her eyes, because she didn&#146;t know how to love 
that child. How she listened to the tiny heartbeats and looked 
terrified with her big green eyes at the screen of the ultrasound. How 
she wanted to be so desperate a loving mother &#150; but wasn&#146;t simply able 
to.

Because of that asshole!

She kicked him again and again while tears were running down her 
cheeks. She sobbed hard and she finally let him go into his knees 
while she reeled. Helpless her shoulders hang and she choked as she 
saw into dark eyes that still didn&#146;t understand what he had done. That 
he destroyed not only one single life with his lust.

How my Ruka wakes up almost every night. Screaming, trembling. Crying 
as if the world would end...

&#147;I hate you, you rude...&#148; she reached her henshin high into the air 
and Neptune&#146;s planet slowly formed in her shaking hands. &#147;ignorant 
asshole!&#148; She screamed and her scream could be heard in whole Tokyo. 
Maybe in whole Japan. Maybe in the whole world. Quickly she lowered 
her hands and the planet flew up to him. Now he didn&#146;t grin anymore. 
Now he looked very frightened with a sudden. But Michiru didn&#146;t care. 
He also didn&#146;t care when he hurt her lover.

The man groaned deeply and fainted. He wasn&#146;t dead. Michiru knew that 
she had huge powers but she also knew that her Neptune&#146;s planet 
couldn&#146;t kill anyone as long as she wasn&#146;t in life danger. It couldn&#146;t 
kill anyone by attacking him. But it could by defending herself.

He&#146;s alive. He&#146;ll be alive until he dies one day. As an old man.

Michiru turned around and went over to Haruka. The young car racer 
didn&#146;t move during the whole battle. Her cheeks were wet. She cried, 
too. But she made no sound. No sob, no chock. She simply squeezed her 
Himme- chan knowing that she would do it again. To save her daughter 
she&#146;d do anything. Even dying. But at the same time she knew that it 
was over. As he fell down and fainted she knew that he would never 
ever hurt her again. He was still alive. But Michiru hit him so hard, 
so aimed and made sure that he would never ever be able to hurt any 
woman again.

Blood covered his trousers and she knew that he would never ever rape 
a helpless woman again. A woman who only wanted to defend her 
daughter.

Slowly Haruka went on her knees because her whole body trembled to 
much. She let go of Hotaru who watched her parents with big eyes not 
understanding what happened. Then she wrapped her arms around her 
arched body and bowed her head.

It&#146;s not it&#146;s fault It never been. 

She swallowed hard as her lover embraced her. She could feel how her 
Michi-chan trembled as much as her. She heard her silent sobs and felt 
salty kisses on her cheeks.

&#147;What...?&#148; Several senshi ran towards them. They had heard Michiru&#146;s 
desperate cry and transformed quickly.

Sailor Moon forget her ballet and looked terrified at the bleeding 
body in the grass and at the crying woman, holding each other tight.

&#147;Guess he got his fair punishment.&#148; Whispered Mamoru and took the 
handy that laid still on the ground. Silently he dialled the number 
and called the ambulance. Ami took the future senshi of death in her 
arms and she and the other senshi exchanged glances. Not knowing what 
to say. Not knowing what to do. They stood there as the ambulance 
came. They stood there as the men in white carried the man away &#150; not 
asking how it happened. They stood there as the ambulance was gone. 
Watching at the two outer senshi. With pale faces. Only Setsuna smiled 
a thin smile. Knowing that it was over know &#150; even if the birth would 
be in about two weeks.

They went through hell. But now they finally reached paradise.

Together.

Setsuna didn&#146;t ask the future. She didn&#146;t have to misuse her powers.

She simply knew it.

***

The pain increased inside her body. She groaned oppressed and wanted 
to get up. It took her several tries before she was able to leave the 
bed. Slowly she went over to the bathroom and stayed near the opened 
window. Fresh wind played with her sweaty short blonde hairs and she 
took a deep breathe. Both hands were holding a huge belly. They came 
home late at night. Hotaru was with Usagi so that they had some time 
on their own. That they could hold each other the whole night. 
Comforting each other. After the battle in the park.

I am grateful for such nice friends.

She winced as the pain increased again and bowed a little bit.

It can&#146;t be. There&#146;re two weeks left.

She gasped hard and took to steps to get to the toilette. But she 
didn&#146;t reach it. The pain was taking her breathe away and she went on 
her knees on the soft carpet. She bowed her head and tried to breathe 
regularly. As she had learned during the lessons she took part at &#150; 
together with her Michiru. First the other couples had stared at them 
but soon they got used to the couple always teasing each other around. 
Joking over the baby and laughing when the teacher scolds them.

It can&#146;t be.

She whimpered as the pain filled her whole world. Then she felt 
something warm running down her legs. It wasn&#146;t blood. Her shirt was 
wetted by sweat and she knew that she had to wake up her girlfriend. 
But she didn&#146;t know how.

It can be!

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148; she whispered and wondered how shaky her voice suddenly 
was. Of course she had read all those books Setsuna brought them from 
library. Often they sat at the couch in the evening studying them 
together. Looking at the picture and discussing the text above. They 
talked a lot about the birth but suddenly Haruka feared that she 
wasn&#146;t ready now.

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148;

I&#146;d never be ready for it.

The door was pushed open and the light was switched on. Michiru was at 
the next moment at her lover&#146;s side. She saw scared deep green eyes 
and knew what happened.

&#147;Two weeks too early.&#148; She mumbled and helped her lover up. Slowly 
they walked over to the bed and Haruka sat down. She breathed hard as 
if she just ran a very long way. Michiru opened the wardrobes and 
searched for some clothes. Soon the whole sleeping room was a mess and 
Haruka knew why they packed that special bag a long time ago.

She sighed relieved as the pain decreased but she knew that it wasn&#146;t 
over yet.

&#147;Are your labour pains coming quickly?&#148; asked Michiru and pulled a 
summer dress over her suddenly trembling body. She shortly brushed her 
hair. Then she helped her lover out of the wet shirt, dried her body 
with a soft towel and helped her into a wide maternity dress she 
bought special for this day. Haruka didn&#146;t even protest that she 
didn&#146;t want to wear a dress. She simply hold her belly and gasped hard 
for breathe.

&#147;I don&#146;t know...&#148; she whispered and groaned again. There was the next 
pain coming and she almost fell on the ground. But Michiru hold her 
tight. She grabbed with one hand the bag with the other one her 
groaning girlfriend.

&#147;We should hurry up. If he&#146;s as impatient as you then we&#146;ll see him 
before we&#146;re getting into the hospital.&#148; Teased Michiru while she 
helped Haruka downstairs. Suddenly every step was too high and the 
senshi of the wind seemed to need eternity. &#147;Car racers!&#148;

Haruka froze and Michiru blushed deeply as she recognized what she had 
say.

&#147;He? It&#146;s a boy?&#148; Haruka asked and looked down at her arched belly. 
She never asked about the gender because she feared...

What the hell did I fear?

She didn&#146;t know. She simply didn&#146;t think of anything else than the 
pain returning inside her belly.

&#147;Hai. We&#146;ll have a small son.&#148; Declared Michiru with a shaky voice and 
opened the door. Haruka took another deep breathe but she felt too 
weak to argue again with her lover.

Why should I argue with her?

She didn&#146;t find an answer of that question, too.

&#147;Don&#146;t forget the car keys.&#148; Whispered Haruka and leaned herself 
against the handrails. She took another deep breathe and smiled as 
Michiru&#146;s eyes widened and she ran again into the light house by the 
sea.

***

&#147;Breathe. Regularly breathe!&#148; Michiru hold her lover&#146;s right hand 
tight. Haruka rolled her eyes and groaned again as the pain increased 
to a level she didn&#146;t expect yet.

&#147;What do you think I am doing?&#148; she growled and laid her head again on 
the pillow. Her sweaty hairs hang in her pale face and she wanted to 
take a shower. But didn&#146;t know how the get up from the bed. They got 
to the hospital in a speed Haruka feared that Michiru would cause an 
accident. She simply speed up and let her know that they drove a 
Ferrari. That she was indeed a car racer&#146;s girlfriend. Michiru helped 
her out of the car and yelled at all nurses that this was an 
emergency. They helped Haruka into a wheelchair and brought her away.

Michiru wanted to follow her but they didn&#146;t want to let her pass. 
Because she wasn&#146;t a family member. That was the moment when the 
senshi of the wide ocean screamed very loud and very raging. So they 
let her through to get their peace again.

&quot;Hey, I didn&#39;t went to all those lessons to keep silent now! So I&#39;ll 
tell you how you&#39;ll have to breath!&quot; teased Michiru with a big grin 
that showed that she felt with her lover. Not only mentally. Her whole 
body trembled, too and the young car racer asked herself if it wasn&#39;t 
even harder to become a daddy than a mommy.

&quot;I do it. I do it. You don&#39;t have to yell at me.&quot;

&quot;Gomen...&quot; Michiru blinked and looked wildly around. But there was no 
doctor yet. The nurse left three minutes ago to call for someone and 
suddenly the young violinist didn&#39;t know what to do.

What shall I do if the baby&#39;s coming right now? And I am the only one 
who can help her? I don&#39;t know how to bring a child in this world! I 
don&#39;t...

Haruka smiled a tired smile as she looked at her exited lover beside 
her.

Is she even more scared as I?

&quot;Hey, Michi-chan. Calm yourself down. Everything will be right!&quot; 
Michiru turned her head and smiled nervous back at her and Haruka knew 
that she was right.

&quot;How do you know that?&quot; she asked in a very shaky voice and the young 
car racer could see tears sparkling in those wonderful deep blue eyes 
she loved so much.

She&#146;s my light. She&#146;s my life. I don&#146;t know how I should have survived 
all those months without her.

&quot;Instincts.&quot;

Haruka squeezed the icy hand tenderly that was holding her own one 
tight. The senshi of the wind knew that Michiru would never let her 
go. That she would hold her - as long as it would take to give birth 
to this child.

&#147;I love you.&#148; She gasped and bit on her lower lip as the pain 
increased again. Michiru nodded with tears in her eyes.

&#147;I love you, too.&#148; It was not more than just a shaky whisper.

The door was opened and Dr. Sagurasa entered the room. She smiled 
friendly at the couple.

&quot;It&#39;s nice to see you again. To see you in that situation is pleasure 
for my old eyes.&quot; She said and came over to the bed. Almost tender she 
stroke over sweaty short hairs and looked into scared green eyes.

&quot;Nice to delight you...&quot; breathed the young car racer through her 
teeth and wondered how much pain she could bare. How much it would 
take the child to push her to her limits - and how easily she would 
cross them.

&quot;Joker.&quot; Said Dr. Sagurasa and smiled. Then she controlled Haruka&#146;s 
state of body. She looked once at Michiru then decided quietly that 
she was allowed to stay. The pregnant young woman needed her and the 
doctor didn&#146;t care a lot about hospital rules. Maybe the see green 
haired beauty didn&#146;t belong to the other&#146;s family by law. But if love 
made family then she was one of the groaning one&#146;s closest member.

&#147;It&#146;ll have a lot of aunts, am I right?&#148; she asked and smiled as 

Haruka rolled her eyes and groaned again oppressed. She clenched her 
fists around her girlfriends hands and her face showed how much pain 
she felt right now. The young car racer didn&#146;t want any medicine 
before the child wasn&#146;t born and again Dr. Sagurasa knew that the 
young woman already loved that child. Although she didn&#146;t admit it to 
herself yet.

&#147;They&#146;re already here?&#148; asked Haruka and bit again on her lower lip. 
She tasted blood and felt tears burning in her eyes. She looked up at 
Michiru and knew that she needn&#146;t to be ashamed about the weakness the 
young violinist saw right now. 

The senshi of the wide ocean giggled and squeezed Haruka&#146;s hands back. 
For her her lover wasn&#146;t weak at all. Right at this moment she was the 
strongest woman Michiru had ever seen. Giving birth to their child.

&quot;I promised Usagi to call her up when you&#39;re in hospital.&quot; Said the 
young violinist.

&#147;Guess they&#146;re making all the nurses crazy.&#148; Said Haruka oppressed and 
started to breathe harder again. The pain was almost unbearable and 
she had to fight hard against herself not to cry out loud.

&#147;How could you guess?&#148; asked the doctor and placed herself between 
Haruka&#146;s legs. The young woman wore a white shirt now and it smelled 
of disinfectants. Normally she would have been ashamed to lay in such 
a helpless position. But now she didn&#146;t care about it. She only wanted 
that pain to be over. And she wanted her child to be born. At last 
born.

So that I can see it. And decide...

&#147;Instincts.&#148; Laughed Haruka and groaned loudly as the pain reached 
it&#146;s climate. She grabbed her lover&#146;s hands tight and heard the soft 
voice she loved so much saying calming words.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Ruka. I am here. Right here. I won&#39;t leave you. Not now. 
Never. I love you...&quot;

She didn&#146;t listen to them. All she felt was the pain inside her body.

All she heard were the words of the doctor.

&#147;And now press, Haruka. That looks good. You&#146;re doing it very well.&#148;

It was one of those moments when Dr. Sagurasa decided that there was 
no need anymore to be too polite. But there was a need to be familiar. 
She saw the tears running down over two pale faces. The young woman 
closed her eyes and did as she was told.

&#147;Just a little bit harder. Hai... That&#146;s good.&#148; The door was opened 
again and one nurse came into the room. She said nothing but took 
position right behind the doctor. To help her and to call quickly 
other doctors if there were any complications.

But there weren&#146;t any.

Please, come out!

Haruka pressed her eyelids hard together, felt her lover&#146;s hands 
holding her own ones tight. The pain seemed to torn her apart.

Please, be healthy, small boy!

&#147;Press. That&#146;s good. Hai, right this way. And here comes the tiny 
head.&#148; Commented the doctor with a calming voice that remembered 
Haruka suddenly of her mother. When she had been a small child. Loved 
by her family...

Suddenly her fears were gone and she trusted the doctor. Although the 
pain was incredible she pressed once more as she was told.

Please, let me love you!

The pain almost torn her apart. She couldn&#39;t hold back a scream and 
grabbed hard her girlfriend&#39;s hands. Michiru stopped talking. Now she 
held her hand tight, too. Being with her. All the time. Suddenly 
Haruka  felt how something left her body. Someone...

&#147;And here he comes.&#148; Said Dr. Sagurasa and Haruka could hear Michiru&#146;s 
sobs. And then she heard a high, protesting scream. It filled the 
whole room and it was the most beautiful scream Haruka had ever heard. 
It sounded angry as if the child didn&#146;t want to be born. That it 
wanted to be back in it&#146;s mother&#146;s belly. That it was cold outside.

It was an angry and wild scream. It remembered Haruka of the scream of 
a bird flying high in the sky. Being carried by the wind. Under it 
there was the wide ocean. The sea that would hold it if it would ever 
fall...

Haruka sobbed and her head fell on the pillow again. She breathed hard 
and felt suddenly very exhausted. Very tired. But at the same time so 
excited. So happy she had seldom been in her whole life.

&#147;It&#146;s a little boy.&#148; Declared the doctor and a warm bundle was laid in 
Haruka&#146;s arms. &quot;And don&#39;t tell me he wasn&#39;t worth it, Haruka.&quot; It 
sounded like a warning but Haruka knew it wasn&#39;t.

The young woman swallowed hard. Then she opened her eyes and stared 
into deep blue ones. The small child yawned tired and stopped 
exhausted to scream. It&#146;s skin was red and crumbled. But it was the 
most beautiful face Haruka had ever seen. The tiny head was covered 
with wet, fluffy hairs. The colour was a light blonde. Like her own 
strands...

Again another yawn. Two tiny hands reached for her and touched her. 
Haruka swallowed again and more tears were running down her cheeks. 
She wasn&#39;t ashamed about them. She didn&#39;t even mentioned them.

He&#39;s so tiny.

He&#39;s so weak but yet so strong..

Haruka lowered her head and kissed automatically the child&#39;s tiny 
forehead. He closed his eyes and made a face as if he didn&#39;t want to 
be disturbed. As if he needed his time to get some sleep. To be ready 
to face this world. His future. His family.

He&#39;s my son...

&#147;He&#146;s beautiful...&#148; whispered Michiru with a shaky voice and more 
tears run down her cheeks. &#147;I love you, Ruka.&#148; She said and trembling 
hands touched carefully tiny ones. The baby didn&#146;t mention it. It 
yawned again and settled down into sleep after an exiting birth. &#147;And 
I love him too, Ruka. Our small son.&#148;

Haruka didn&#146;t respond anything as she heard her lover&#146;s soft words. So 
true words. She didn&#146;t feel the pain anymore that was still in her 
body. That would die away during the next hours. Dying away forever. 
All she saw was the tiny child in her arms. Sleeping deep and tight. 
Trusting her. At that moment she made her decision.

&#147;Congratulation.&#148; Whispered Dr. Sagurasa relieved as she saw the proud 
couple with their child.

***

&#147;It&#146;s a boy!&#148;

The scream filled the whole hospital. Some patients and some visitors 
look up in surprise as a blonde haired girl crashed into the waiting 
room.

&#147;It&#146;s a boy!&#148;

Minako smiled such a big grin that some of the visitors feared that 
her face would break apart. A wild shinning sparkled in her light blue 
eyes.

Ami rose from her chair and threw the book high into the air. Makoto 
shouted happily while Rei jumped on the table and did a loud and 
moving prayer of gratitude to the goods.

Chibiusa took Hotaru in her arms and swirled around with the still 
very tired girl who didn&#146;t know what was happening.

&#147;It&#146;s a boy!&#148;

Usagi grabbed Setsuna&#146;s hands and danced with her through the whole 
waiting room. For the first time the senshi of time didn&#146;t care about 
her age or what other people thought and danced with her future Queen. 
Happily laughing. Only Mamoru stood in at the wall and smiled knowing 
at them all.

&#147;It&#146;s a boy!&#148;

Then they took each other by the hand and danced through the whole 
hospital as if it was Sylvester or carnival. The nurses let them do. 
Some of them even clapped in their hands as they sung well known 
songs. But they changed the texts completely.

&#147;It&#146;s a boy!&#148;
