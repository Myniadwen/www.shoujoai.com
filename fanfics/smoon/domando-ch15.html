<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 15 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>The song is called &quot;Tomorrow&quot; by Avril Lavigne. I don&#39;t own the song nor 
Sailor Moon.

This chapter is dedicated to my dear friend Krys. She has such a hatred 
for Ami and I&#39;ve never been able to get a straight answer out of her as 
to why. So Romeo, this is for you.

Dr. Mizuno yawned as she opened her front door. She hated working night 
shifts and coming in on her days off. She hated doing both.

She dropped her keys on the small table at the enterance way and kicked 
her shoes off. She felt bad when she couldn&#39;t see Ami off, but part of 
her was joyous that Ami had called her at work, deciding she didn&#39;t want 
to leave Japan after all.

Dr. Mizuno climbed the stairs to her bedroom. As she neared Ami&#39;s door, 
she noticed it was cracked and decided to have a peek in on her 
daughter. She quietly opened the door and did a double take.

Ami was there, but there was some boy with her as well. Dr Mizuno 
blinked. This couldn&#39;t be her Ami!

She looked up and no longer saw the boy. Instead she saw Ami&#39;s cat, Leo, 
laying on Ami&#39;s pillow, purring softly next to Ami&#39;s head.

Dr. Mizuno sighed as she closed the door. &quot;I need a vacation...&quot;

Ami dressed as Raiga sat on her bed. Ami&#39;s mother was fast asleep by 
now, so Raiga feared nothing as he sat on Ami&#39;s bed in human form.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe my mother saw us,&quot; Ami said under her breath.

Raiga sat in silence for a moment. Then he said, &#147;Does it really 
matter?&#148;

Ami looked up at him, blinking. &#147;Of COURSE it matters! We&#146;re so lucky 
she came in off her night shift.&#148; Ami then went back to tying the bow on 
her uniform.

Raiga smiled a bit. &#147;You&#146;re stressed out. I can tell.&#148; Ami looked up 
again. &#147;You should calm down. Everything will be alright.&#148;

Ami sighed and turned away. She finished tying her bow and grabbed her 
school bag. She headed for her bed room door then stopped. She turned 
and looked over her shoulder, not exactly looking at Raiga.

&#147;I wish I could believe you...&#148;

Ami walked alone to school. She had left early on purpose so she 
wouldn&#146;t have to meet up with the others. She wasn&#146;t sure how they would 
react to her wanting to leave and not telling them.

As Ami neared her school, she glanced up and saw the girls already at 
the school gate. Ami blinked and looked at her watch. She groaned 
slightly when she realized she wasn&#146;t late. They were early as well.

I guess they know me better than I thought, Ami thought to herself.

She put on her best fake smile and approached them. Usagi, as usual, was 
the first to notice her.

&#147;Ami-chan!&#148;

Ami smiled more as she neared them. Thats when she noticed not everyone 
was here. Minako was missing.

&#147;Usagi-chan. Rei-chan. How are you two this morning?&#148;

Rei shrugged. &#147;A little peeved. Why didn&#146;t you tell us you were 
leaving?&#148;

Ami hung her head.

&#147;Don&#146;t yell at her Rei,&#148; Usagi said. &#147;She could have had her reasons for 
not wanting to tell us.&#148; Usagi then looked to Ami. &#147;Right?&#148; Ami nodded.

&#147;Sorry I&#146;m late,&#148; Minako said in a huffy voice.

Rei and Usagi turned to see Minako running towards them.

Rei smirked. &#147;And WHY are you late?&#148;

Minako returned the smirk, with a devilish glare. &#147;Late breakfast.&#148; She 
then giggled. She turned to Usagi then to Ami, her glare becoming icy.

&#147;H-hi, Mina-chan...&#148;

It happened all too fast. Usagi and Rei would have both sworn later that 
it didn&#146;t happen...That they were simply imaging things.

Then ofcourse Ami on the sidewalk, holding her left eye, and crying, 
would prove them wrong.

Minako still stood in her postion from the punch. She glared down at 
Ami.

&#147;You BITCH!&#148;

&#147;WOAH!&#148;

&#147;HOLD IT!&#148;

At the same time, Usagi and Rei jumped onto Minako, holding her back 
from the mousey girl on the ground. This gave Ami just enough time to 
stand from where she fell and run back towards her home...

And I wanna believe you,
When you tell me that it&#39;ll be ok,
Yeah I try to believe you,
But I don&#39;t

When you say that it&#39;s gonna be,
It always turns out to be a different way,
I try to believe you,
Not today, today, today, today, today

I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll feel,
tomorrow, tomorrow,
I don&#39;t know what to say,
tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day

Ami cried silently on her bed. Her face hurt from where Minako had 
punched her. In her head, she cursed Minako for doing it, but in her 
heart, Ami knew why.

Ami had nearly ruined everything for the two of them just as they were 
starting to get their lives back in some sort of order.

After a few hours, Ami calmed down enough to drift into an unrestful 
sleep. She awoke several hours later by a loud knocking on her bedroom 
door.

Ami stood from her bed and ran her fingers thru her hair. She opened her 
bedroom door and there stood Raiga, in human form. Ami blinked at him, 
obviously slightly ticked at seeing him here in non feline form.

But before she could scold him, he said, &quot;Your mother isn&#39;t here. She&#39;s 
at the store.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;You woke me up for that?&quot;

He shook his head. &quot;No. You have a vistor.&quot; He stepped aside so Ami 
could go downstairs.

She walked into the living room, and almsot ran back upstairs. Minako 
was sitting on Ami&#39;s couch, acting as if nothing had happened earlier.

Ami walked into the room and sat in a chair furthest away from Minako.

&quot;What do you want?&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;Rude much?&quot;

&quot;After what happened this morning? Yes.&quot;

Minako shrugged and showed Ami her school bag she had dropped. &quot;You left 
this at school.&quot;

Ami blinked. She hadn&#39;t even noticed she had dropped it. She reached 
over as Minako offered it to her, and took the bag. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Minako nodded then stood. &quot;Come on. We have a meeting to attend.&quot;

It&#39;s always been up to you,
It&#39;s turning around,
It&#39;s up to me,
I&#39;m gonna do what I have to do,
just don&#39;t

Gimme a little time,
Leave me alone a little while,
Maybe it&#39;s not too late,
not today, today, today, today, today...

I don&#39;t know how I&#39;ll feel,
tomorrow, tomorrow,
I don&#39;t know what to say,
tomorrow, tomorrow
Is a different day

The senshi meeting was quite abnormal compared to the others. Everyone 
was...quiet.

Too quiet.

And then-

&quot;Why the hell couldn&#39;t I transform?&quot;

Luna looked to Makoto as did everyone else in the room. Luna sighed and 
shook her head.

&quot;We have no idea...&quot;

&quot;Will I be able to again,&quot; Makoto asked, slightly worried.

Agian, Luna shook her head. &quot;We&#39;ll need time to figure this out, Makoto. 
Your body has under gone so many transformations, it may be confused.&quot;

Silence.

&quot;What about this,&quot; Ami pipped in quietly. &quot;Makoto is older than us. And 
she has more experiance. Is it possiable her transformation is more 
advanced than ours?&quot;

Luna thought for a moment. &quot;Thats a very interesting point, Ami-chan. 
I&#39;ll have to look into that.&quot; Luna then looked to Minako. &quot;By the way, 
where is Artemis?&quot;

Minako shook her head. &quot;He said he was checking something out. But thats 
all I know.&quot;

Luna nodded.

&quot;What about our enemy, Luna,&quot; Rei asked. &quot;Anything on them yet?&quot;

&quot;Clueless. All we know is that they want Cbibiusa and the Imperial 
Silver Crystal. But we&#39;re not sure why.&quot;

&quot;Where is Chibiusa,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Mamo-chan has her right now,&quot; Usagi said.

Silence again.

&quot;If thats all there is to this meeting, I&#39;m leaving,&quot; Makoto said, 
standing from her place on the floor. Minako also stood and took 
Makoto&#39;s hand.

&quot;See ya, you two,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Ja,&quot; Usagi and Ami said together.

Makoto nodded and left the room, Minako waving as she was guided out by 
Makoto. When they were outside, Minako stopped Makoto.

&quot;Something wrong?&quot;

Makoto shook her head. &quot;No.&quot;

Minako didn&#39;t push it and walked with Makoto down the temple stairs to 
their car. They both climbed inside and Makoto started the car. She 
pulled out of her parking spot, and drove in silence.

Minako glanced over at Makoto before gently placing her hand over the 
amazon&#39;s. Makoto may act tough and as if nothing bothered her, but 
Minako knew just how fragile she really was.

As they drove, the came across an intersection that was backed up, and 
people were running in the direction from where they just came. Makoto 
and Minako looked at one anther before jumping out of the car and 
running towards the thing the people were running from.

When they approached the site, the saw several cars destroyed, and a few 
crater sized pot holes in the road. But no youma.

They glanced around, water lightly spraying them from the broken fire 
hydrent.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Minako said, chancing a look up.

Makoto blinked and also looked up, her breath catching in her throat.

Floating above all the carnage, was a young man. He was wearing a blue 
jacket with white pants. He also had dark blue hair.

Makoto blinked.

&quot;..Yung Hu?..&quot;

And I wanna believe you,
When you tell me that it&#39;ll be ok,
Yeah I try to believe you,
Not today, today, today, today, today...

Tomorrow it may change</pre>
