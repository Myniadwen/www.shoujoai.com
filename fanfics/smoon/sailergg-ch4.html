<h1>Sailer GG (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/pedarandersson.html">PederAndersson</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sailergg-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>	Michiru scaled the stairwell up to the front door, unlocked it then
stepped into the hallway and placed the bag of groceries on the floor as she
closed the door. Haruka&#39;s voice was present in the house accompanied by
footsteps that came closer. Her wife appeared in all her pregnancy with a phone
close to her ear. Kishimo. Haruka shaped the name with her lips and Michiru
smiled slipping out of her shoes and snuck into the kitchen and began unpacking
the groceries.
	&quot;Yeah. Michiru came home. She has promised to cook.&quot; A smile shaped on
Haruka&#39;s lips as she glanced back over her shoulder towards the kitchen. &quot;I made
her feel guilty this morning.&quot; She released a little laugher as a reply to his
comment and stopped to look at the muted TV. &quot;Not exactly.&quot; She scratched her
elbow. &quot;It was about sex. The case that we have had less of it since I became
pregnant.&quot; Kishimo interrupted her and her lips flattened with sadness. &quot;Its not
because I have slept with you. She&#39;s just afraid of hurting me or the babe.&quot;
Haruka pulled her fingers through her hair while he was speaking. &quot;But back to
the hose. Do you have time to fix it?&quot;
	Michiru walked past her blabbering wife and into the bedroom. Opened the
wardrobe and began Unbuttoning her blouse while looking for something more
comfortable to slip into. Sighed as she loosened the buckle keeping her shirt up
and it fell to the floor.
	Haruka stood in the doorway watching, slipped the phone into the pocket
of her trousers as her wife reached around to unhook her bra. Slowly the smile
grew over her lips as she looked at the the frame of her wife&#39;s back. The
movement of the skin, the nuance of the spine, waist a slim relish, armpits a
brisk breeze as Haruka inhaled the perfume that came towards her. &quot;Thanks.&quot; Her
voice was a shallow desire and Michiru turned somewhat embarrassed about her
wife&#39;s sudden appearance. &quot;For taking my words to heart.&quot; She came a few steps
closer to feast her eyes on the naked chest of her lover. Wide her eyes grew and
the reflection of Michiru with them. The kiss summoned feelings within the two
and Haruka allowed her hand to venture down Michiru&#39;s thigh while inside her
that flame called love intensified.
	Her nipples brushed against the fabric of Haruka&#39;s shirt as Michiru
leaned forward, cuddled her forehead close to Haruka&#39;s cheek and remained there
inhaling the heat radiating towards her. &quot;I love you.&quot; Closed her eyes like they
where heavy metal curtains and waited with her smile until she could feel the
beat of Haruka&#39;s heart.
	A kiss against the spring green hair then two hands firmly grabbing
Michiru&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Do you want help with dinner?&quot;

Chapter 4: Butterflies.

	Haruka opened the fridge door and inspected what Michiru had bought.
Turned and looked at her wife who arrived collecting her hair and fastened it
with a scrunchie to keep it together. &quot;You bought wine.&quot; She said with a
surprised joy.
	&quot;Yes.&quot; Michiru&#39;s said with her fingertips trickling down the frame of
Haruka&#39;s back. &quot;It would complement the food and make you easier to seduce.&quot;
	&quot;But its non alcohol.&quot; Haruka said eyebrows high on her forehead.
	&quot;That&#39;s just how easy you are.&quot; Michiru reached for the meat and the two
began the intricate ritual that was cooking.



	&quot;Kishimo had a date tonight.&quot; Haruka said while slicing the shallots. &quot;A
university gal.&quot;
	Michiru made two deep incisions in each of the chicken fillet before she
replied her voice oozing with worry. &quot;Does he have second thoughts about the
agreement?&quot; 
	&quot;This is the third date.&quot; Haruka smiled her face bright with joy. &quot;He
told me about her only because he told her about the agreement.&quot; She looked at
Michiru. &quot;His lady wants to meet us.&quot;
	&quot;Why?&quot; Michiru said while stuffing thin slices of leek into the
incisions. &quot;She gay too?&quot;
	&quot;Straight as a pine.&quot; Haruka continued. &quot;You don&#39;t need to worry. She
thought he was cute for helping me getting pregnant so he must become gorgeous
after helping you.&quot; Haruka smiled as the nervous fa&Atilde;&sect;ade on Michiru&#39;s was
replaced with a smile. &quot;He will honour our agreement, that was why we decided on
him.&quot;
	&quot;Yes.&quot; Michiru slapped the chicken then placed a lamb chop on top and
sprinkled it with shallot. &quot;At least she knows he is capable.&quot;
	Haruka shook her head. &quot;Wait till you get some and you&#39;ll know how
capable he is.&quot; The two erupted with laughters that reminded them of their high
school years.



	Michiru placed the two wine glasses on the table then sat down close
beside her wife in the sofa and leaned herself against Haruka&#39;s shoulder.
&quot;Tired?&quot; Was replied by a head leaning against hers and a exhale passed over her
face leaving her smiling as she brought her hand below Haruka&#39;s shirt and felt
the belly with eyes closed. Dug a fingertip into the shallow navel then traced
the hair down towards the line of the trousers then back up again. The touch
made Haruka smile, made her relax, made her complete as a woman. Michiru&#39;s soft
hair against her face, the odour that she liked. Memories that came bursting up
inside her like flowers on a warm spring meadow. Movement. Movement inside her
belly, a dance of butterflies that brought Michiru&#39;s hand to a stop and Haruka
held her breath. &quot;It moved.&quot; The words where spoken as if Haruka was in ecstasy.
&quot;She moved.&quot; Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s fragrant scalp through the hair, wished the
sensation of butterflies would come to her belly once more as the caressing
continued.
	The kiss came suddenly and Haruka did only receive a taste of the grace
that was Michiru&#39;s lips before the wife slipped away from her with a teasing
laughter that filled the room. She realised that she had been asleep and reached
forward to take her glass, brought the delicate tasting wine to her lips and
allowed it to please her mouth while she listened to her wife rummaging about in
the kitchen. Looked down at her bare belly and smiled recalling the sensation of
the moving child.
	Michiru opened the oven door and relished in the vapour of the food that
rose towards her, lingered a moment before she continued with preparing the
rice.
	&quot;I&#39;ll light some candles.&quot; Haruka said entering the kitchen with a wine
glass in each hand. &quot;It has been weeks since a romantic occasion such as this.&quot;
The longing in her voice was sharp but the edge not directed at Michiru but more
at herself.
	&quot;I will tell my boss that I want to spend more time with you.&quot; Michiru
said carefully as she looked at her wife. &quot;Share the time remaining with you to
the fullest.&quot; She released a giggle. Received a thought in her head that made
her heart leap and the taste of desire came to her mouth. &quot;What do you say about
a early night?&quot;
