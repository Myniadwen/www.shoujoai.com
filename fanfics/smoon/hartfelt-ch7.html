<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 7 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><p>“<i>Do you really think we did the right thing by telling her about Rei?”</i></p><p>On 
the far side of the palace entrance, past multiple doorways and various stairwells, there 
was a single room that sat apart from the rest of the guest quarters. It sat at the end of 
its section, with no nearby window to shed light onto its entrance--a tiny door-- it was 
nothing more than an insignificant, wooden frame that dutifully guarded its current master 
from prying eyes of the outside world. However, unlike the bright world beyond the palace 
walls, the inside of the chamber was drowned in 
darkness.</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>…<b>FfFfzz…</b></p><p>Inside the chamber’s center, 
as one would not expect, was not the eye of the storm but the storm itself.</p><p>“<i>I 
believe so. If Minako starts to see Rei differently now because of this, 
then…”</i></p><p><i>...Different…?</i></p><p>Amethyst eyes crawled open, fiercely aware of 
her tingling senses. Her hearing had become sharply acute as she listened for echoing 
footsteps in the corridors outside.</p><p><i>Did they hear me? </i>Rei knew Ami and Makoto 
weren’t slouches at this game. They were no longer the timid children that they used to be. 
<i>If they found out that I’m…</i></p><p>Rei narrowed her eyes, and then closed them 
altogether. The energy she spared from her sight was transferred towards her spiritual 
activities.</p><p>…<b>FfFzz…FfFfzz…</b></p><p>…<b>FfFfzz…</b></p><p>“Nothing,” Rei 
half-whispered to herself. “They must have moved on…”</p><p>However, the Martian performed a 
few more readings just in case. Only until she was satisfied did she release the pent up 
energy into her surroundings; the strands of red energy, resembling snakes, crawled away 
from their source and curled up within the inanimate objects within the room. They dropped 
into drawers, slipped beneath the bed covers and became one with the threads that carpeted 
the floor by the front door. Being raised the way she was, Rei disliked wasting anything; 
instead of allowing the energy to dissipate into useless heat, she manipulated it into a 
greater purpose. She set a trap throughout the room. If a presence should ever step foot 
into the place she would know instantly by the extension of her own soul (it was rather 
difficult to overlook the feeling of someone trampling on oneself).</p><p>But was she really 
worried about being found? Everyone knew she went to rest. She had even announced it! 
Everyone knew where she was.</p><p>Unable to explain the flood of emotions she was 
experiencing, Rei allowed the silence to take her again. It was almost comforting to see 
reality reflecting the bleakness ravaging her heart. She was feeling restless and her 
muscles were tense. She wanted to do something, but what could she do? The damage had 
already been done.</p><p><i>This is crazy, why am I feeling like this? </i>Rei snapped at 
herself. She held herself up on her knees, pondering this damning confusion. <i>Who cares if 
Minako knows that I’m not… like her or like any of them for that matter? She would have 
found out sooner or later anyway. </i></p><p>She just hadn’t seen the point in announcing to 
the world, that’s all.</p><p>Rei’s dark eyes began to cloud up in memory. A nostalgic wave 
of emotions gripped her tightly, tugging on her, beckoning her to someplace she did not want 
to visit as a child to its mother. Her pride rebelled. In that instant Rei shook her head, 
struggling for air, and sought for a shred of her cool, collected nature. When did it become 
so hard to breathe? But there was no time for that, for the line between reality and memory 
blurred; the woman’s thoughts had already melded through some unexplainable connection. The 
answer for her stubbornness, she already knew it.</p><p><i>It was always—no, not always. It 
wasn’t always like this! Ami, Makoto, Neptune, Haruka …</i></p><p>She knew the 
reason.</p><p><i>It’s all because of what happened back then. That day, everything 
changed...</i></p><p><i><u>(Neptunalia, Palace of Neptune, 8 years 
ago…</u></i>)<br><i><br>“Did you hear?” A man whispered to his friend.</i></p><p>“<i>I can’t 
almost believe it.” A woman across the street broke out into nervous 
laughter.<br></i><i><br></i><i>There was an excited piece of gossip on the streets of 
Neptune; today was the day that the royal heirs would gather together for one of their 
annual visits. As it was decided from way back, it was the planet’s turn to host the reunion 
for this year. It was their turn to be honoured with so many powerful and influential beings 
at once, and, in truth, many found the opportunity to be wonderfully overwhelming. Though 
the people of Neptune prided themselves for their physical beauty, they knew that they would 
someday grow old. Their hair would turn gray and their skin should wrinkle, but there were 
creatures who even Father Time could not influence- Gods. Admiring a God or Goddess from 
afar, as the citizens would often do to their leader, would stir a sense of wonder and envy 
within them or a sense of peace. But to see a gathering of so many magnificent persons! 
Imaginations went wild; the women would swoon and the men would gawk. Oh, and the heirs were 
okay too. Word on the street had rumoured that the tykes were reaching those teenage 
years.</i></p><p><i>Now normally there would be much to do to prepare; any host of the Gods 
and Goddesses would be somewhat concerned about presenting themselves in a fashionably 
manner. Yet their leader had her preparations complete long before the guests had arrived. 
There was little to do in the first place; the city already was blessed with a unique 
beauty. Unlike Mercury and their technology, or Mars with its deserts, Neptune possessed 
naturally built-in streams that ran throughout its capital city. The water itself often 
proved to be more than enough entertainment for the foreigners; many souls found the sound 
of the watery splashes soothing, or they would content themselves by watching their own 
reflecting off of the clear, blue surface. For those who tired quickly of the cool 
substance, if not careful, they would lose themselves by simply gazing at the splendid city 
of white and blue marble, crafted into finely decorated structures. Only the capital city of 
Venus or Uranus could come even close to mirroring its exotic beauty.</i></p><p><i>It wasn’t 
until early afternoon when the guests finally arrived. Standing serenely at the front gate 
waiting to greet them was Neptune’s current ruler, and her young daughter and heir. The 
child at Neptune’s side was a tiny girl, with shoulder length aquamarine hair and eyes like 
her mother. With those charming young eyes, she would peer down the line of approaching Gods 
and Goddesses, keeping a watchful eye for others of her class and 
rank.</i></p><p>“<i>Mercury, Jupiter, I bid thee welcome,” Neptune greeted the two 
approaching rulers. Beside Mercury and Jupiter were two girls who looked to be a year, if 
not two, younger than the Princess of Neptune. Ami shyly watched the headstrong Neptunian 
princess, while Makoto offered a mumbled ‘hello’ on behalf of herself and her shy 
companion.</i></p><p>“<i>I hear that Aphrodite will not be attending,” Mercury spoke up. He 
looked to be a tall, blue haired man in his prime. The decaying process of age had not laid 
a finger on him or his fellow comrades.</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, I heard word from her messenger 
yesterday,” Neptune replied regretfully. “Apparently she is held up by business 
matters.”</i></p><p>“<i>Business matters!” Mercury immediately scoffed. “I doubt it very 
much. She hasn’t shown her face amongst us for years now. Where is her heir? Did we not all 
agree to these annual gatherings?”</i></p><p>“<i>Now, now Mercury,” Jupiter spoke to his 
friend. “At least we know that Lady Aphrodite is alive and well. It may be that some of us 
need more time to adjust to the changing times. The new era has only been established five 
years ago.” Mercury gave a reluctant nod at this. He could not seem to find any grounds for 
argument with his patient friend. “Besides, Lady Neptune always hosts the most amazing 
parties. I think we should try to enjoy ourselves. It has been very stressing year for all 
of us.”</i></p><p>“<i>I agree,” Neptune smiled. “We are still awaiting a few guests, so 
until we have all arrived, feel free to wander about. There is no need to hurry with the 
meeting.”</i></p><p><i>As the three adults continued to chatter with each other, Ares and 
Uranus had finally arrived. The two men were most likely gloating over who had the better 
heir, yet something was amiss-- the heirs themselves. The Princess of Neptune and her 
friends continued to throw curious glances towards the newly arrived rulers as they passed 
by. Neither of them appeared disturbed by this fact.</i></p><p>“<i>Where is Haruka and Rei?” 
Ami finally asked.</i></p><p>“<i>One guess,” Makoto sighed. “You know how they 
are.”</i></p><p><i>Both girls were slightly startled when, without a word, the Princess of 
Neptune fiercely spun on her heels and began to march back towards the palace. Unlike her 
companions she didn’t need to guess where the two culprits had gone. She knew exactly where 
they went, and she wasn’t at all too pleased.</i></p><p><i>Although the business meetings 
took place within the palace, it was well known that Neptune always threw a type of 
relaxation party afterwards in the field behind the Godly structure. Food, drink and 
entertainment of all varieties would be served. The adults would talk some more while the 
children would become more acquainted with each other out back.</i> <i>Although today there 
were two participants who were a little more than anxious to get the festivities 
started.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p><i>Two blurs dashed out 
from the palace’s back entrance and into the field where they promptly ducked underneath one 
of the party tables. The tablecloth, to their delight, was long enough that it reached to 
the ground, proving to be a very effective hiding place.</i></p><p>“<i>So, do youf tink thay 
saw us?” Haruka mumbled as her partner peeked underneath the tablecloth for pursuers. Her 
mouth was stuffed with the cookies they had ‘borrowed’ from the kitchen. The rest of the 
pile lay in her long arms.</i></p><p>“<i>I don’t think so...” Rei was ninety percent sure; 
she couldn’t see anyone charging their way cursing, or waving a kitchen utensil like a mob 
with pitchforks. In fact, she just couldn’t see anyone. There was no one in sight in the 
field, just the empty party tables. Perhaps her and Haruka were just that good? 
</i></p><p>‘<i>Hmm…’ But strangely enough, she was still getting the feeling that they were 
being watched. Rei frowned at this, and contemplated whether or not she should do a 
detection reading. While behind her, Haruka stuffed another handful of cookies into her 
mouth.</i></p><p>“<i>Want some?” The blonde offered.</i></p><p>“<i>No thanks.” Rei shook her 
head. “You know how bad sweets are for training! If I suddenly got fat, I’d get hell if Ares 
finds out.”</i></p><p><i>Both girls knew that ‘hell’ went along the lines of more chores, 
shifts on cleaning duty, and having their training increased to massive proportions. Oh, and 
none of them could forget the worst punishment of all- the ‘lecture’. People would be 
mistaken if they thought it was a simple, talk/scolding session. It always started with 
talk, but it always ended with a practice fight against the planet ruler. It was a very 
painful lesson, and Haruka could personally attest to that! The last time she picked a fight 
with Uranus, the old man knocked her out with a spinning kick (they really don’t hold back 
if you slacked off, nothing like a little discipline to straighten a child out). Normally 
the conditions for punishment in Mars and Uranus’s military ranks were very similar, but 
Rei, on the other hand, wasn’t too worried about a punishment like Haruka’s. She had bigger 
worries on her plate if the God of War found out.</i></p><p>“<i>Man, that dude is a hardass. 
Growing kids NEED sweets to survive!” Haruka bit down on another cookie. “Besides, you worry 
too much yourself. You gotta enjoy things while you can! This is what we have now. You can’t 
even get this stuff living on the streets, you 
know...”</i></p><p>“<i>Still…”</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Uh...Rei? Did you 
just feel that?”</i></p><p><i>Rei and Haruka slowly turned their heads, and stared at the 
shadow hovering on the tablecloth in front of them.</i></p><p>“<i>Bad feeling…” Rei flatly 
stated as she watched the shadow’s hand reaching towards the white cloth.</i></p><p>“<i>So 
uhh… Rei, you know about our training</i> <i>plan to infiltrate and not get caught?” Haruka 
rambled quickly in a moment of fear.</i></p><p>“<i>Yeah?”</i></p><p>“<i>I think we’re 
screwed…”</i></p><p><i><b>FWOOSH</b></i></p><p>“<i>There you are!” An angry voice cried out. 
Rei and Haruka (with her armful of cookies) blinked back at the Princess of Neptune. Her 
aquamarine eyes were shooting daggers at the pair before her, especially at 
Haruka.</i></p><p>“<i>Uhh… hello dere,” Haruka gave a nervous laugh. “Want a 
cookie?”</i></p><p>“<i>No thank you,” The girl replied coolly.</i></p><p>‘<i>What a snob,’ 
The Martian heir secretly thought. She never really liked the other girl, especially now 
than ever. The Neptunian Princess had so many masks that it irritated the Martian; why 
couldn’t she have shown her true face earlier rather than hiding it for all these years? 
During their last visit the girl really exposed herself as the snob she 
was.</i></p><p>“<i>What’s with that look? If you have something to say, then out with it! 
You know we aren’t supposed to have deserts until after the meeting and everyone’s had 
dinner.”</i></p><p>“<i>But Michiru, you know Rei and Haruka have always been like this.” Ami 
spoke up on their behalf. She flinched back when those angry aquamarine eyes turned on 
her.</i></p><p>“<i>She’s right,” Makoto nodded. “Why not leave them alone? It’s not like 
they’re going to listen to you, you know.”</i></p><p><i>Michiru looked up at the taller girl 
in annoyance. “Why are you sticking up for them? They aren’t like us at all!” She pointed. 
“They’re only human!”</i></p><p><i>Haruka put another cookie in her mouth, looking 
undisturbed by the comment. Rei on the other hand felt like her blood was beginning to 
boil.</i></p><p>“<i>Or have you forgotten that they used to live on the streets for Goddess 
sakes?”</i></p><p>“<i>And what’s wrong with that?!” Rei shot back.</i></p><p><i>Michiru 
gripped her fingers into tiny fists.</i></p><p>“<i>I couldn’t care less which planet you’re 
both from. But living on the streets means that you were both thieves! Or do you deny it? 
How can we even think of trusting scum like you?!” </i></p><p><i>Rei was about to snap. How 
dare this twit talk about something she’s never known about? While her and Haruka had to 
endure many hardships just to survive all of these years, this snob was being pampered like 
a spoiled brat by her mommy. Even now! Rei doubted Michiru had to work nearly as hard as the 
‘former thieves’ had to in preparing for their futures. </i></p><p><i>Just when the words 
were about to spill out of her mouth, the Martian suddenly noticed something odd about the 
girl in front of her; there were tears forming in her eyes. Oh great, now what? But they 
weren’t fake tears. Michiru suddenly seemed genuinely saddened by something. Everyone was 
rendered speechless; if it wasn’t one thing Michiru did, it was crying.</i></p><p>“<i>I 
can’t believe I trusted you!” She shouted and ran off.</i></p><p>“<i>Michiru!” Haruka called 
after her. The blonde gave a quick glance down at the cookies in her arms before she dumped 
them onto Ami, and ran off to find the Princess of Neptune. “Michiru, wait 
up!”</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Huh.” Was all Rei could muster. Most 
of her earlier anger had drained away and was replaced by confusion. “Did I... just miss 
something here?”</i></p><p>“<i>Michiru is still in shock from the truth...” Ami answered 
quietly. Rei seemed slightly taken aback that it was Ami who had spoken, and not Makoto. 
From all the years they’ve known each other, the blue haired girl appeared to be very 
intelligent (more so than the rest of their group, though Rei sometimes hated to admit it). 
However, the prodigy genius had a bad habit of clamping up and never uttering a word for 
periods on end.</i></p><p>“<i>The truth?” Rei arched an eyebrow. She felt the pains of 
irritation prickling her heart at the mention. “Oh riiiight, I remember now. She was all 
nice and polite when we first met but after she learned something new about our pasts, she 
went all Miss Snob. Suddenly, we’re monsters!” She growled in a sarcastic 
voice.</i></p><p><i>Ami lowered her eyes to the ground. She disliked seeing Rei like this. 
After all, it wasn’t Haruka or Rei’s choice to live on the streets or to live as 
orphans.</i></p><p><i>Apparently Makoto was thinking the same thing.</i></p><p>“<i>You both 
aren’t monsters,” Her friend agreed. “I think you’re both nice people. Perhaps a little 
strange, but when you think about it we all are to some degree.”</i></p><p>“<i>Well no duh, 
we all live on different planets.”</i></p><p>“<i>That is correct.” Ami’s voice became 
slightly bolder. She almost winced back in surprise when Rei’s intense eyes fell on her, but 
she relaxed and continued on; there was no hostility towards her reflecting in them. “Yet 
that is precisely why Michiru is acting the way she is now.”</i></p><p>“<i>Like a 
snob?”</i></p><p>“<i>Rei…”</i></p><p>“<i>What?”</i></p><p>“<i>Rei, if you haven’t noticed, 
Michiru likes Haruka!” Rei blinked back dumbly at Makoto. The Martian opened her mouth to 
say something but nothing came out. What could she say to something like that? “Actually, it 
was Ami who first pointed it out to me. But when I watched them, it really does seem like 
it. I really do think Michiru does like Haruka.”</i></p><p>“<i>Ami did?”</i></p><p>“<i>Well, 
all the signs pointed to it,” She replied in a scientific voice. “I suspect that Michiru is 
behaving the way she is now because romantic relationships between Gods and Goddesses with 
‘normal folk’ are frowned upon. I truly doubt that her anger stems from what she wants you 
to believe.”</i></p><p><i>Rei carefully digested this new information.</i></p><p>“<i>Well I 
still don’t see the problem. Someday, Haruka’s going to take over the throne of Uranus. When 
she does that, she’ll become a Goddess you know.” </i></p><p>“<i>Yeah…” Makoto crossed her 
arms. “Yeah, I almost forgot all about that! And you know what? Michiru might’ve too! What 
do you guys think? Do you think we should go and tell her?”</i></p><p><i>Ami looked around 
her before she realized that she was the one being addressed. “W-Who? Me? You want me to 
tell Michiru?”</i></p><p>“<i>Why not?”</i></p><p>“<i>W-Well… I do think it may resolve a lot 
of tension between us…”</i></p><p>“<i>Good enough! So let’s go, I think I saw them head in 
this direction,” Makoto began walking forward a few steps. “Oh, you’re coming too, right 
Rei?”</i></p><p>“<i>Why should I go?” There was some bitterness lacing her 
words.</i></p><p>“<i>Oh, nothing. I just thought you wouldn’t want to leave Haruka alone 
with Michiru, that’s all.”</i></p><p><i>The comment hit its mark and Makoto knew it. As soon 
as the words had left her mouth, Rei bolted upright and sprinted off in the direction that 
Makoto had indicated.</i></p><p>“<i>What are you two standing around for? Let’s get going!” 
The Martian shouted over her shoulder.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></i></p><p><i>While deep inside the palace, two sets of loud footsteps echoed 
throughout the long corridors. A voice cried out after the Princess of 
Neptune.</i></p><p>“<i>Michiru!”</i></p><p><i>The other girl hesitated for a moment in 
indecision before she looks over her shoulder. Her beautiful eyes were red from the earlier 
crying yet she couldn’t help herself. She couldn’t stop crying or running. In a sense of 
great urgency, she begged her legs to keep their pace; her blonde pursuer would surely catch 
her if she slowed any bit.</i></p><p>“<i>Michiru!”</i></p><p>“<i>Stop chasing me 
Haruka!”</i></p><p>‘<i>Just stop chasing me…’ She inwardly pleaded. Already her breaths were 
coming out in short pained gasps. The footsteps behind her were 
gaining.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p><i>In a great hurry, Michiru suddenly 
felt her feet catch in the fabric of her dress. The tangled predicament caused her knees to 
clip each other. Once or twice her balance waned as they fumbled desperately to keep from 
falling but she couldn’t. Her hands released their tight holds on her dress’s sides and the 
fabric fell, falling almost as quickly as she 
was.</i></p><p>“<i>Ah!”</i></p><p><i><b>TUP!</b></i></p><p><i><b>THUD!</b></i></p><p><i>Michiru 
waited for the crashing pain of the fall to take her. Yet when she felt nothing but softness 
beneath her, she curiously opened her surprised, aquamarine eyes. She let out a squeak when 
her soft cushion suddenly jerked away and rolled to her side. She couldn’t help but stare. 
Short strands of blonde hair flew past her line of vision, catching her eye. Her gaze slowly 
turned to follow the glimmer of gold to its owner’s face—flush, from the running or from 
embarrassment she couldn’t tell. The awkward, child-like grin Haruka had plastered all over 
her face brought Michiru to silently wonder.</i></p><p>“<i>I--Uh…” Haruka’s eyes darted 
everywhere but to Michiru’s eyes. She gave a nervous laugh. “Oh darn, the cookie got 
crushed! I was going to give it to you, but I guess…” There was an awkward silence as 
Haruka’s dark green eyes finally fell onto the floor.</i></p><p><i>The blonde was struggling 
for words, a difficulty that she wasn’t used to. Usually she took life as, ‘whatever 
happens, happens” because brooding over something was a waste of time. Or was it? What if 
there was something or someone important? Well, anyhow, she had always thought that way; it 
was a way of life she had adapted back on the streets. But being an orphan and then suddenly 
becoming the heir of her planet, what had happened was still somewhat of a shock to her. 
When Michiru had said all of those hurtful things, although she never showed it like her 
friend did, they did sting quite a bit. </i></p><p>“<i>I-- I’m sorry.” Haruka finally 
replied flatly. She hated to admit her own faults, especially to the girl sitting in front 
of her.</i></p><p><i>Michiru’s tears had long stopped flowing, but their traces could still 
be seen on her delicate face. She almost couldn’t believe what she had just heard. 
</i></p><p>“<i>You’re sorry?” She repeated in disbelief. A touch of anger sparked again in 
her weary body.</i></p><p>“<i>Yeah… I-I know you’re angry about my past, but it’s something 
that I can’t help! You’re angry that I’m not a Goddess right?” One look at Michiru’s face 
confirmed her suspicions. “If that’s all it is, then don’t worry! When 
I-”</i></p><p>“<i>Don’t worry?!” The girl nearly yelled. “If you knew that much… All you 
have to say ‘don’t worry’? How can you say that so casually?”</i></p><p>“<i>I’m not. I’m 
being serious...”</i></p><p><i>The lost playfulness in Haruka’s voice slapped Michiru hard. 
Haruka’s stern features strongly supported her claim.</i></p><p>“<i>When I’m strong enough, 
I’ll take the throne from Uranus. I’ll take it, and I’ll become a Goddess! A real one! Then… 
then you won’t have to cry anymore…”</i></p><p><i>Michiru was left speechless and weary from 
the swirl of emotions within her. Relief? Happiness? She couldn’t say, although she knew 
what the blonde was talking about.</i></p><p>“<i>I think someone needs a hug.” 
</i></p><p><i>Michiru was vaguely aware that she was in the blonde’s arms or that Haruka was 
whispering something else into her ear. “I’ll get strong real fast. I’ll become a Goddess... 
and then, I’ll come back for you.”</i></p><p>“<i>Haruka I-”</i></p><p><i><b>Tup… tup… 
tup…</b></i></p><p><i>Both girls froze at the sound of approaching footsteps. The heir of 
Uranus threw glances up and down the corridor, but no person or presence could be seen. The 
sudden tension in the atmosphere prompted Haruka to hold Michiru tighter than she ever had 
before. Her dark green eyes were narrowed and defensive. She didn’t like this feeling at 
all; there was something unnatural and icy about the air.</i></p><p><i>However, unlike 
Haruka, Michiru could sense this presence. How could she not?</i></p><p>“<i>Mother...?” 
Across the corridor at the T intersection, the elder Neptune stepped into view. However, 
there was something strange about her mannerisms. She did not acknowledge them. She kept 
walking forward with her eyes concentrating on something hard, yet on something that no one 
could see. It was almost trance-like. </i></p><p>“<i>Mother?” Michiru called again, but her 
words fell on deaf ears.</i></p><p><i>Michiru tried to stand, to go to her mother and ask 
what was troubling her, but Haruka held her fast.</i></p><p>“<i>Don’t!” She hissed. Michiru 
gave her a questioning gaze; Haruka’s green eyes were burning with an intense fire, one that 
she’d never seen before.</i></p><p><i>Following far behind the elder Neptune, Rei, Makoto 
and Ami peeked out from around the corner to make sure that they hadn’t been spotted. Rei 
was acting strange and none of the two other girls could understand why. Why were they 
following the Goddess anyway?</i></p><p>“<i>I-I don’t think Michiru and Haruka are here…” 
Ami huddled closer to Makoto’s side. The darkness of the halls frightened her; she had 
sensed the sudden shift in the ambience.</i></p><p><i>Rei knew otherwise. “No, they were 
here.” Her amethyst eyes locked onto the aquamarine and golden spiritual clouds on the 
floor. The fact that the two heirs were in such a place troubled her deeply, but she 
wouldn’t allow it to show.</i></p><p>“<i>Are you sure?” Makoto asked with dark eyes; 
Jupiter’s heir hadn’t quite mastered her power of detection quite yet. She was well aware 
that she wasn’t on the same level as the Martian in that aspect, but she did know that she 
was just as acutely aware to danger.</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Hear that?” 
Makoto’s muscles tensed. Judging from the stillness in Rei’s stance she knew the other girl 
had.</i></p><p>“<i>Someone’s fighting.”</i></p><p><i>The trio raced down the corridors, 
following the force that drew them. The air became heavier and stale, the temperature-kept 
rising, and the stench of danger exponentially grew with each step they took. Once or twice 
did the group have to stop for air and determine their next course of direction, but the 
break was never long as Rei would almost expertly find their invisible trail. The 
predicament was frightening, especially to the children barely in their teens. The force 
that beckoned to them all stirred a sense of fear for the unknown (more than once did Makoto 
have to coax her withdrawn blue-haired friend to continue with them). </i></p><p>“<i>It’s 
all right Ami. We’re all right here. I’m here...” Makoto outstretched her hand. Beside 
Makoto, Rei nodded. </i></p><p><i>It was not the darkness itself that Makoto and Rei feared, 
but the possibility that if they left the smaller girl behind then she would be swallowed by 
that very darkness.</i></p><p><i>Ami could see the strength and kindness that reached out to 
her, and without hesitation she took it.</i></p><p>“<i>I know…”</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! 
Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p><i>The trio hit a staircase moments later. It was the deepest in the 
palace that any of them had ever gone. Far below from where they stood they saw a mystical 
light dancing upon the floor, being emitted from the chamber in their direct line of vision. 
Just witnessing the sight made the girls’ hearts leap inside their chests—this was it, the 
source they had been looking for. But why were their friends down there? </i></p><p>“<i>It’s 
down there,” Rei confirmed her friends’ suspicions.</i></p><p><i>Without wasting time they 
all bolted down the spiralling steps and rushed the light. Rei was the first to vanish into 
the room, just as two piercing screams rang throughout the 
air.</i></p><p>“<i>MOTHER!”</i></p><p>“<i>EYAAAAAAAAAAH!”</i></p><p><i><b>FLASH!!</b></i></p><p><u>(Present,</u> 
<u>Rei’s room, Palace of Mercury)</u></p><p>“<i>EYAAAAAAAAAAH!”</i></p><p>Rei calmly opened 
her clouded eyes at the sound of the distant, echoing scream. She had heard it many times 
before, heard it repeat itself over and over again within the darkest realms of her soul. 
That scream had embedded itself into her memory; she could not rid herself of it. None of 
them could. None of them could forget what they saw that day, eight years ago.</p><p>“But 
first things first…” Rei gave a disheartened sigh. Although a piece of her rebelled strongly 
against the thought, she resolved to go through with it. <i>I have to find Minako… Ami and 
Makoto have already told her about me, but I don’t know how that ditzy idiot is taking it. I 
don’t want her going off and doing anything stupid now that she knows; I’m still responsible 
for her! </i>Her mind retorted. But a little voice within Rei, uncertain and timid, was 
asking, <i>‘Will she be as angry as Michiru?’</i></p><p>With her mind made up, Rei prepared 
another network of detection readings. This time she was going to locate the Princess of 
Venus.</p><p><u>(Lower basement of Mercury)</u></p><p>Further into the depths of the palace 
of Asta, down all the staircases and secret passages, lay a chamber. And in that chamber lay 
a monster--a being that has never slept or known the existence of daylight. It would 
restlessly make noise for hours on end, demanding attention and recognition. It became more 
demanding as time’s fingers tickled across its gray skin, threatening to burn it. In 
response the beast would cry out in its own language, but not today. Unlike many days, today 
there was a purpose for it. Blindly it heeded its master’s orders and turned its attention 
onto a small, dark haired girl. It was a child its senses told it. Crossing the first 
threshold of recognition, it continued along its way to learn what else it could about the 
strange life form.</p><p>“What does it say?” Makoto curiously asked Ami.</p><p>In front of 
the two women was a small, rectangular chamber, propped up parallel to them. Through the 
glass comprising its front, they could see Hotaru. Their visitor was sleeping peacefully, 
her face absent of any signs of discomfort or pain. Jupiter’s ruler didn’t know for the life 
of her of why they were doing a bio scan on the girl.</p><p>“The database isn’t saying 
much.” Ami replied slowly. “It confirmed our suspicions that Hotaru is a child, but as for 
her exact age, it seems that it cannot determine it. As far as it’s concerned, Hotaru is 
just an ordinary, healthy, young girl.”</p><p>“Hmm...No family, no home, and no past? But 
there’s got to be something! She couldn’t have just appeared out of 
nowhere.”</p><p>Mercury’s ruler was just as puzzled as her tall friend. For once in her 
life, her intellectual genius couldn’t come up with a reasonable explanation for their 
dilemma and it terribly frustrated her. This was one problem that she <i>needed</i> to 
solve! Any information may prove to be vital for later.</p><p>“I wouldn’t say out of 
nowhere...” <i>But close enough, </i>Ami inwardly sighed.</p><p>“What do you mean? Didn’t 
you just say that the computer couldn’t find anything?”</p><p>“Rei mentioned it.”</p><p>“She 
did?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Makoto watched as Ami slowly turned to face her. She always felt a shock 
whenever she saw those blue eyes staring back at her. There was a clarity to them that 
almost appeared to be mysterious all at once.</p><p>“Right after you called, I received an 
urgent message from Rei. She told me that Haruka had found one half of the 
key.”</p><p>“You’re kidding! Are you trying to tell me, that this girl is....?” Makoto’s 
green eyes trailed back to the sleeping child, wide in apprehension.</p><p>“Yes, that is 
correct. From the legend of the Sun Kingdom, there is a rumour that Apollo possessed the 
power of the ‘key’. As the story describes it, it is a terrifying power, that if manipulated 
properly, it could potentially bring about the end of the solar system. Even Gods and 
Goddesses would not be spared if such a power was unleashed.”</p><p>“Yet no one knew where 
this power was hidden, correct?” Makoto saw Ami nod. “Then how did Haruka know where to 
look? What does she know that we don’t? And why would this ‘power’ be on Saturn? Hotaru is 
just a harmless, innocent girl, right? Right…? Ah, this is making my head hurt!”</p><p>Ami 
silently watched Jupiter grimace as she tried to make sense of it all.</p><p>“But there’s 
nothing on Saturn. There’s nothing there but purple fog. How can Haruka possibly say that 
she found Hotaru there…?”</p><p><i>Hotaru is from Saturn? </i>Behind the two women, hidden 
in the shadows, a pair of blue eyes blinked. Minako had hidden herself well behind the wall 
of machinery. <i>I wanted to ask them more about Rei, but when they started getting all 
serious… it was just plain scary.</i> The blonde tried shifting her weight to get a better 
look at the two people. <i>What could be so important about Hotaru? What are they 
planning?</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>Makoto suddenly flinched and whirled around in 
Minako’s direction. An expression of comprehension washed over her normally relaxed 
face.</p><p>“Minako?” Minako froze. <i>Oh no, they’ve sensed me? W-What should I do? </i>She 
panicked. What would Ami and Makoto do once they realized she had been eavesdropping on 
them? Already a row of excuses whizzed through in her head. <i>I-I didn’t mean to! I just 
wanted to ask more about Rei, honestly! </i>She practiced in her mind like she was cramming 
for a school test. It was the honest truth after all, but the fear of not being believed was 
overwhelming. Already she could feel the two pairs of eyes piercing through her with their 
intense gazes.</p><p><i>Someone…</i> She saw Ami’s eyes turn in her direction as well. Her 
anxiety increased as did her heartbeat. When Makoto took a few steps in her direction, 
Minako’s blue eyes squeezed shut.</p><p>“Makoto!” A voice rang out.</p><p>Minako saw Rei’s 
form enter the room, just to the side of where she had hidden herself. For a second, the 
blonde thought she saw those amethyst eyes flick towards her direction.</p><p>“R-Rei?” 
Makoto’s startled eyes flew to the raven-haired figure. Ami’s as well. Neither of the two 
women expected the Martian to make an appearance so soon. When Rei was in a bad mood she 
tended to meditate until she was called upon. “I…ah, so it was you? What a surprise! How are 
you feeling? Do you feel better after having a rest?”</p><p>“Mm.” Rei gave a slight 
nod.</p><p>“That’s wonderful news,” Ami smiled warmly, already having recovered from her 
earlier shock. “Makoto and myself were just discussing matters relating with Hotaru’s 
bio-scan.”</p><p><i>So she knows about Hotaru now... good. </i>Rei felt relieved that she 
wouldn’t have to explain it all over again. Once was enough for her; she didn’t have all the 
answers to the questions that would surely be asked of her. It was mentally exhausting just 
thinking about it.</p><p>“Well…” Jupiter started. “Apparently Ami’s computer can’t decipher 
anything out of the ordinary about Hotaru.”</p><p>“Are you sure? It really found nothing?” 
Rei frowned. She knew that Haruka would never joke about something as serious as 
this.</p><p>“Yes, but it’s still too early to conclude anything,” Ami reminded her two 
friends.</p><p>“Hmm...”</p><p>“Actually, this might be good.” Makoto suddenly spoke up. All 
eyes were on her now. “If no one is busy with anything that is... As you mentioned earlier 
Rei, I did have business with Mercury. But that might include you too now, I mean, since 
you’re already here. I need help.” She finally admitted with clenched fists. Her troubled 
green eyes grew stormy and wild with mixed emotions.</p><p>The air grew heavy as soon as 
those words left Makoto’s mouth. Her two friends could hardly believe what they had just 
heard; Makoto, like Rei and Haruka, often fought her struggles on her own terms. That was 
how the three of them were raised, to believe in their own strength without having to rely 
on others. Their planets were prideful in that aspect. Yet even if that were not the case, a 
leader who cannot fix any problems on their own wouldn’t be considered a leader at 
all.</p><p>“Help…?” Rei said once she regained her serious composure. <i>But what could it 
be?</i></p><p>“It’s all right Makoto. Please tell us what’s bothering you. I am sure both 
Rei and I will be more than glad to assist you in whatever way we can,” Ami encouraged. Rei 
crossed her arms, but nodded in agreement.</p><p><i>You guys…</i> Makoto could feel some of 
that heavy burden upon her shoulders lift instantly. Suddenly she no longer felt ashamed or 
inferior. <i>I really missed this. </i>She realized.</p><p>With a deep breath she began her 
tale.</p><p>“As you both already know, Jupiter has a problem with storms. But with help from 
Mercury we were able to build a system to control these storms. Recently though, these 
storms have been gaining tremendous power! Honestly, I didn’t think much of them at first. 
It’s not unusual to get a strong storm here or there. But... when they just kept on getting 
stronger… Anyway, I suspected that there might be a fault in the system so I sent a team of 
soldiers and scientists to inspect it. But...”</p><p>Her voice trailed 
off.</p><p>“...But?”</p><p>Makoto bit her lip. “They--they never came back. So then I went 
to investigate instead. I managed to find the place easily enough, but when I tried to 
approach the main controller I was repelled by an invisible force! It’s like there’s some 
kind of barrier around it. I know it sounds really strange, and even I don’t know why it’s 
like that, but I’ve tried just about everything I could. I just can’t get near the darn 
thing. I’m just... I’m really worried. If something isn’t done soon, a very powerful storm 
could potentially destroy my people! That’s why, I need help…”</p><p>“None of the others 
know about this…?” Ami inquired gently.</p><p>Makoto shook her head. “I tried but I couldn’t 
get a hold of them.”</p><p>“Then we’ll help you.” Rei promised. She already knew what was 
going through Mercury’s mind. The other ruler had already made up her mind to help Makoto, 
no matter what the problem was. And although the Martian felt a twinge of bitterness that 
her friends revealed her secret to Minako without her permission, she wasn’t about to let 
something so pity prevent her from helping her childhood friend in her time of need. They 
were in this together.</p><p>“Do you mean that?” There was a hopeful note in Makoto’s 
voice.</p><p>Behind the group, Minako was looking just as surprised as the ruler of 
Jupiter.</p><p>…<i>Rei? </i>The blonde questioned. She had never seen this side to Rei 
before.</p><p>“Yeah, but make no mistake. I’m still pissed at you for keeping this to 
yourself for so long Makoto! If you have a problem like that, then you should’ve just told 
us! It doesn’t do anyone any good if you go off hurting yourself for nothing!”</p><p>“Uh…” 
<i>Haha, and you’re the one telling me this…? </i>“I’ll keep it in mind.” Makoto finally 
replied.</p><p>“We’ll leave immediately,” Ami nodded. “The trip itself will take some time. 
Therefore, the sooner we leave the faster we can fix this problem.”</p><p>“Thank you, both 
of you…”</p><p>“Never mind that,” Rei waved off the thanks. “Ami, could you set us up the 
transportation? Oh, and take Makoto with you. I’ll stay here and tend to Hotaru.”</p><p>“Are 
you sure?” The genius wondered. Did Rei even know how to operate the computer 
system?</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure. Once I’m done I’ll go and tell Minako about our plans as 
well.” Behind her the two Goddesses exchanged knowing glances. Rei didn’t know it, but the 
two women had already suppressed their auras and had quietly tip-toed away.</p><p>“I don’t 
know if she would want to come along or not. Maybe she’ll stay here or maybe we can drop her 
and Nozomi off on Mars on our way to Jupiter. Now that I think about it that might be for 
the best. If she wants to go home, she can easily catch a shuttle from there.”</p><p>“No 
way, I’m coming!”</p><p>Rei whirled on the spot to see herself being boldly confronted by 
the Venusian. She knew where the blonde had been hiding, but she hadn’t expected Ami and 
Makoto to ditch her so quickly!</p><p>“Excuse me?” The Martian couldn’t deny that she was 
surprised by this response. Did Minako forget what she was…?</p><p>“I said... I’m coming 
along.” The blonde’s gaze softened when she saw Rei’s quizzical look. She knew what Rei had 
expected—that she would see the woman as inferior or as something 
disgusting.</p><p><i>But</i> <i>as psychic as Rei is, she can’t read my 
heart...</i></p><p>“I admit I was a bit shocked when I first found out…” Minako started 
carefully. She took careful note of Rei’s reaction as she slowly said this- she was stiff 
and on the defensive. “But I don’t care,” Rei’s stance faltered again. “Learning this 
information doesn’t change who you are. You’re still you, silly. If anything, I’m the one 
who’s changed.”</p><p>“W-What are you talking about?!” Rei sputtered as she turned away, 
looking slightly red faced and embarrassed. She felt confused all over again. One part of 
her wished Minako had been like Michiru, to really be someone who would turn her off 
completely. And yet here she was, acting like nothing had changed. How could she be so 
accepting?</p><p>Unperturbed by the silence, Minako walked up beside Rei and hesitatingly 
took her hand in hers. At first Rei tensed at the contact, but her mind was quickly 
preoccupied with other thoughts when Minako’s soft lips found her 
cheek.</p><p>“Wha--”</p><p><i><b>Kiss</b></i></p><p>“Thank you for covering for me 
earlier.”</p><p><i>Uhh…</i></p><p>“Stop talking nonsense! I never did anything!”</p><p>Rei 
pivoted on the spot and marched over to the computer’s main panel without realizing that she 
was still holding Minako’s hand. She also didn’t notice the happy smile on the blonde’s 
face.</p><p>Minako truly wondered how much longer Rei could remain ‘lucky’.</p><p><i>As long 
as it takes… </i>She told herself.</p>
