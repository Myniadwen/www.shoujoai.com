<h1>Sunday</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/noblemaiden.html">Noble Maiden</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Michiru felt her heart humming heatedly within her breast as she drove 
home from the grocery store. It was only a fifteen-minute ride, but it 
seemed much longer on weekends. She rolled one of the windows down to
catch the Autumn wind in her hair, and sighed happily as the cool breeze
danced exuberantly through her turquoise locks. Watching the crisp,
tangerine colored leaves cling frailly to the tree branches ahead of her
made her feel pleasantly at ease, and she let out a trickle of song to
keep her company on the ride home.

&quot;I adore this time of year,&quot; she thought to herself. She loved wearing
big warm sweaters and snuggling up cozily by the fireplace. An automatic
blush rose to her cheeks as that thought came to mind. Michiru pressed
her foot against the accelerator and sped down the road. Sunday was the
best day of all, in her opinion. She and Haruka both hardly had a minute
to spare throughout the week. What with college, homework, and all the 
other activities they pursued, it seemed as if the only time they saw
each other was when they awoke in the morning and went to bed at night.
&quot;I have her all to myself on Sundays,&quot; Michiru thought gaily as she
rushed home to spend the day with her beloved.

After they graduated from High School, Haruka thought that it was time 
they moved from their apartment to a house of their own. The world was
at peace. Galaxia and Chaos had been defeated, and the Princess and her
Court were safer now than ever, so Michiru agreed. It was about time
they started to learn how to relax! After dealing with the stress and
anxiety of Senshi lifestyles, the couple opted for a more serene,
picturesque environment.

Right outside of the city overlooking a vast forest they found the 
perfect place to start their lives anew. It was small, but comfortable.
Michiru, finally arriving home, stepped out of the car and took a moment
to view her surroundings. The cobblestone path leading from the driveway
to the front door was laid out by none other than Haruka herself about a
week after they moved in. Michiru laughed out loud as she remembered the
way her lover had carefully arranged the stones while women driving by
rolled down their windows to get a better look at the handsome young
&quot;man&quot; working in his yard. There were roses in the garden, which circled
the exterior of the house. Michiru loved roses, especially white ones,
and the garden was her pride and joy. She tended them year round, until
the winters first frost ceased their lives, causing their trembling
petals to curl up in frigid anger. Michiru smiled as she tenderly gazed
at the house she shared with the woman she loved and whispered, &quot;I&#39;m
home.&quot;

She opened the front door slowly, trying not to make a commotion just in
case Haruka was asleep. Gods, that woman could sleep! Sit her down 
anywhere at any time of day and in five minutes she would be comatose.
Michiru&#39;s attempts proved fruitless however as at that very moment their
dog Suki came bounding across the foyer and leaped into her arms!
Michiru laughed while trying to fend off the golden retriever&#39;s slobbery
advances.

&quot;Oi, Michiru is that you?&quot; came a voice from upstairs. &quot;Come on up, I
just got out of the shower.&quot; Michiru felt the blood rush to her face as
she walked up the stairs, leaving the grocery bags abandoned on the
floor.

When she opened the bedroom door and saw Haruka clad only in a towel, a 
quick gasp flew out of her mouth. Haruka&#39;s perfectly muscled and well- 
proportioned body still shone with a few droplets of water, which clung 
to her pale flesh lovingly. Her dazzling sandy-blond hair was tousled
and dripping wet. Haruka didn&#39;t seem to notice Michiru&#39;s reaction to all
of this, and launched into a conversation about an upcoming race and her
next karate belt test. Michiru just gaped. Haruka really didn&#39;t have any
idea how sexy she was, how beautiful she was. It took all of her
strength not to run over and silence her blond goddess with a kiss. She
longed to bend down and worship her with her tongue. She felt a slow,
creeping flush of heat roll through her body. Haruka seemed to get the
drift. She leaned over until she was right in Michiru&#39;s face and
smirked.

&quot;You,&quot; she started, &quot;are such a pervert.&quot;

Michiru vigorously shook her head and averted her eyes. &quot;No...I...um...
you...I wasn&#39;t thinking of anything dirty, I promise!&quot; Haruka&#39;s 
raucous laugh filled the room.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe you Michiru, you&#39;ve got a perverse mind!&quot; It was true.
No one had a sex drive like Michiru.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go put the groceries away&quot; she announced gloriously,
trying to change the subject. She rushed down the stairs quickly, with
Suki two paces behind, and Haruka&#39;s amused chuckle still ringing in her
ears.

Michiru allowed herself to cool down while she organized and put away 
the groceries. Just as she was finishing, she felt strong arms entwine 
around her waist.

&quot;Hey, did you buy anything good?&quot;

Michiru grinned mischieviously and replied, &quot;Oh you know, the usual.
Just some candy, cake, marshmallows, and ice-cream.&quot; Haruka slowly
withdrew her arms and backed away, her face filled with horror. &quot;I abhor
sweets.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s tinkling laugh filled the room. &quot;I know darling, I know. I
wouldn&#39;t do that to you. I know how much you like to stay in shape.&quot;

Haruka breathed a sigh of relief. &quot;Ne, Michiru?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;What do you want to do today?&quot; Michiru crept up to her and draping her
arms around her neck, pressed her face against her lover&#39;s warm chest. 
While Michiru was wearing a short, pale yellow dress, Haruka was 
sporting a jade colored top and faded jeans. Lovely. The shirt wasn&#39;t
horribly low cut, but it was indeed low enough for Michiru to press her
lips against Haruka&#39;s collarbone.

&quot;Maybe we can just curl up and watch a movie?&quot; Haruka kissed her 
forehead lightly, breathing in her scent.

&quot;That sounds great darling. But first, may I play my new song for you?
I&#39;ve been feeling a bit prolific lately.&quot;

Michiru nodded emphatically. &quot;Of course!&quot; Holding hands, they went to
the den, where the piano was kept. Michiru&#39;s violin skills were 
excellent, and whenever she played at a concert the tickets were sure 
to be sold out. But Haruka&#39;s beautiful piano compositions were just as 
lovely, even if she didn&#39;t avidly pursue this talent. Racing came first,
her music was saved for Michiru alone. She sat next to Haruka on the
piano bench and gently laid her head on the golden haired woman&#39;s
shoulder as she began to weave her intricate melodies. Michiru shut her
eyes and let the music wash over her. The harmonious notes made her
think and feel many different things simultaneously; the rapture of a
flower which is caught in the bright sun&#39;s rays, the moon spinning
cobwebs of light upon the world below, the rough wind parting eager tree
boughs delightedly, the ocean&#39;s warm, maternal embrace. The
possibilities were simply endless. She didn&#39;t know whether to laugh or
cry with the joy the music brought to her.

She opened her eyes when Haruka finished playing. The blond turned to 
her lover, anticipation filling her eyes. Michiru smiled. &quot;That was 
absolutely divine.&quot; She got up from the bench and went to lie down on
the couch. &quot;Keep playing, love, I just want to stretch out for a
minute.&quot; Haruka looked over curiously.

&quot;I thought you wanted to watch a movie?&quot;

Michiru smiled indulgently. &quot;Listening to you is much better than
anything we would watch.&quot; Haruka nodded and began to play once more.
They were lucky to have enough money to be able to afford the luxury of
a grand piano. In fact, they were fortunate to be able to pay for the
house as well. Michiru&#39;s parents had withdrawn their economic support
when she told them she was a lesbian. Haruka didn&#39;t really keep in touch
with her parents either. However, with both of their jobs and the money
they received from Haruka&#39;s racing competitions, and Michiru&#39;s concerts,
they were able to live quite nicely. Michiru&#39;s stomach turned violently
within her abdomen at the thought of her mother. She could still hear
the belittling screams her mother emitted when she told her she was in
love with Haruka; in love with a woman. Disappointment. Sin. Unnatural.
Freak. Those words still reverberated in her mind, the last words her
mother had spoken to her since she moved out. It had been the biggest
struggle Michiru ever experienced, leaving like that. It was hard, since
the last thing she had ever wanted was to disappoint her parents. But
she loved Haruka. She loved her more than she had ever loved anyone or
anything. It consumed her utterly. Right from the first moment they met
she knew that she belonged at Haruka&#39;s side. You can&#39;t predict when 
love will strike. You can&#39;t stop it once it has arrived in your life. 
All you can do is just sit back and let it claim you. And Michiru knew
that despite the pain and the sacrifices that needed to be made, it was
all worth it. The knowledge that she shared a perfect and unconditional
love with someone so wonderful made everything okay. Love is always
worth the price you have to pay. Always.

Absorbed in her own thoughts, she didn&#39;t notice that the music had 
stopped until she felt Haruka softly but firmly pick her up off the
couch, enveloping her in her arms. &quot;Wha? Where are we going?&quot; she asked
groggily. 

Haruka started up the steps. &quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot; Michiru snuggled into her 
lover&#39;s warm body as she carried her upstairs. She felt safe like this,
in Haruka&#39;s arms. Nothing in the world could harm her there. Haruka
paused in the bedroom doorway a moment before entering and laying
Michiru down gently on the bed.

The blue eyed woman looked up at her, puzzled. &quot;What are we-&quot; But 
Haruka silenced her with a sudden kiss. Michiru parted her lips slightly
to allow the other girl&#39;s tongue to gently brush against her own, and
felt a small flame ignited somewhere deep inside of her.

Haruka broke the kiss and whispered lasciviously, &quot;I&#39;m going to rape you
with my fingers.&quot; Michiru gasped and arched her back as the blond deftly
slid her hands up Michiru&#39;s thigh and underneath her short dress. Now it
was Haruka&#39;s turn to gasp. &quot;Michiru! You&#39;re not wearing any underwear!&quot;

Blue eyes blinked innocently up at her. &quot;Ooops, I guess I just forgot to
put them on this morning.&quot;

Haruka grinned as she pulled the rest of the dress off. &quot;Liar.&quot; She 
traced a long, slender, finger across Michiru&#39;s already moistened slit, 
relishing the way her love responded to the touch. &quot;I love using my
hands on you,&quot; she murmmered sensuously. &quot;You&#39;re just like playing a
piano.&quot; Michiru let out a small whimper, for she had learned long ago
that words were just as arousing as touches. Haruka parted Michiru&#39;s
legs and thrust two fingers into her warm center. She cried out at the
sudden exuisite waves, which streamed throughout her body. &quot;So
beautiful&quot;, Haruka thought as she watched her lovers body writhe while
she impaled her again and again. She reached up and ran one of Michiru&#39;s
nipples between her fingers. Michiru could not stop the heat filled
throbbing which had taken over her body. She was a bright, pulsing star,
the flittering heart of a hummingbird. She was everything, she was the
world. She screamed as she climaxed, finally allowing the powerful tides
to engulf everything. After the ebb and flow in her body had calmed a 
bit, she looked up at Haruka, and felt desire flame up again.

&quot;How is it that you can be so good at making love to me?&quot;

Haruka smiled and responded, &quot;I guess I just know my women.&quot; Michiru
playfully whacked her on the arm before she sat up and ran her tongue
across the blond&#39;s neck. &quot;Hey, you know you don&#39;t have to do anything to
me if you don&#39;t want,&quot; Haruka began, her breath coming out in short
gasps. &quot;If you&#39;re too tired.&quot; Michiru started to undo the button on
Haruka&#39;s jeans.

&quot;Hush.&quot;

Haruka hushed.

After all of the tomboy&#39;s clothes were off, revealing the immaculately 
feminine figure underneath, Michiru began placing butterfly kisses all 
over her body. Haruka tried to turn away from the achingly sweet touches
against her skin. Without warning, Michiru fell against the bed, lying
on her back, beckoning for the other girl to climb on top.

Haruka blushed. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; Michiru nodded slowly in consent. Haruka
crawled over the supple form of her lover, and kneeling, placed one leg
on either side of Michiru&#39;s head. The teal haired girl felt her flesh
quicken again as Haruka lowered her womanhood gently onto her waitng
lips. Michiru ran her tongue around Haruka&#39;s clit, sensing the blond&#39;s
grip on the bed sheets tighten. Michiru flicked the sensitive bud
rapidly, as Haruka felt white hot flames lick along her veins. After a
brief pause, Michiru plunged her tongue into her lover. Haruka&#39;s world
burst into color as she came, kneeling above Michiru like a perfectly
poised goddess. Everything was light, everything was color. She laid
down next to the blue eyed Princess, trying to regain her composure.
Michiru kissed her lover with a tender wildness she hadn&#39;t known she
possessed, while Haruka dropped an arm across her waist.

It&#39;s funny, isn&#39;t it? How something so wonderful can seemingly come out 
of nothing? They were warriors, Senshi, protectors of the world. And 
somewhere along the way they had fallen in love. Nothing could ever come
in between them now. Michiru turned to comment about this to Haruka, and
was unsurprised to see her eyes already closed, her mouth open in a
goofy expression of unconsciousness. Yep. She was asleep again.
Chuckling, Michiru rose and draped a robe over her sweat-dampened body.
Leaving quietly, she walked outside and sat in the swing on the front
porch. The sun was just starting to set, and twilight was slowly
descending. As she watched the perfect pink, purple, and orange sky
swirl into the darkness of the night, she felt Haruka sit beside her.
They were quiet for a while, neither saying anything.

Finally Haruka spoke. &quot;Even after people create such malice with their
hate, greed, and prejudice, the world is still a beautiful place.&quot;

Michiru thought of her mother and replied, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s true. People 
will always hate what they don&#39;t understand, and persecute those who are
unlike themselves. But, &quot;she turned to Haruka and cupped her face gently
in her hands, &quot;as long as there is love in the world, everything will be
okay.&quot;

Haruka smiled, and leaned into Michiru&#39;s waiting kiss.</pre>
