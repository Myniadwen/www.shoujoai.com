<h1>Secrets of the Sexy Slippers: ChibiUsa</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This story is from a multipart fanfic entitled &quot;Secrets of the Sexy
Slippers&quot;. You can find the other (non-shoujoai) parts at:

A few quick notes from the Amazoness Duo in no particular
order:
*In Japan, to get into a good high school, you must pass the
high school entrance exams. Usagi and the inner senshi were
studying much of their free time in Sailormoon S to get ready
for this. ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru are almost at the age when they&#39;ll
have to take that to get into high school the next year.
ChibiUsa has lived in the past for a while now, and Hotaru
had reaged to around ChibiUsa&#39;s age before continuing on
normally. Both girls are 15, and getting ready for the
entrance exams.
*In the manga, Michiru taught Hotaru how to play the violin
as she grew older. We thought it was great that Michiru would
teach the girl she helped raise this, so we have kept it in
our stories. In other words, Hotaru can play the violin, so
don&#39;t be surprised if she does from time to time.
*People don&#39;t walk around indoors wearing shoes often. At
school they put their shoes in lockers.
*To fit this series of stories better, we&#39;re using American
names. We still pray that DiC won&#39;t dub the rest of the series,
but now you&#39;ll know why the &#39;scouts&#39; are having so many
meetings during Sailormoon S, the high school entrance exams.
American names might not sound as good as the Japanese, but it
is fun to make them up.^^ ChibiUsa is Rini and Hotaru is Tara.
We&#39;ll be keeping the Japanese names for most of the story, but
like a previous story, this takes place in a slightly different
dimension. The only major difference, though, is the change of
names. The dimension Neo Queen Serenity is in uses the American
names (IE Serena, Darien, Rini, etc.) whereas the dimension
being looked upon uses the Japanese names.

We hope this helped (we&#39;re sorry if any of this was wrong) and
that you enjoy the story. Thank you.

        Neo Queen Serenity looked into the crystal ball as she
waited to see which couple would get the slippers next. She was
rather pleased that she&#39;d been able to help out her friends during
that difficult part of their lives. Serenity was a bit surprised
when she found out her daughter was getting the slippers next. She
smiled to herself. She&#39;d told Darien that there was something more
between Rini and Tara than they had been letting on. Darien had
dismissed the idea, thinking Serena had just been overprotective
of the girl from the future. She remembered the day when Rini and
Tara had finally told everyone about the two of them. She still
used it as an example if Darien thought she might be
misinterpreting something. Serenity wished her daughter luck with
the slippers as she left the room. She thought she&#39;d go have lunch
with her daughter and her wife.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChibiUsa waved to her friends and made her way to her
locker. Before she could open it, she felt a pair of arms wrap
around her waist.
        &quot;Taru-chan, not in school,&quot; ChibiUsa whispered.
        Hotaru&#39;s hands stroked her belly for a moment before heading
upwards. She gently cupped ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts through the cloth
of her blouse and bra. &quot;I don&#39;t mind if everyone knows I love you,&quot;
Hotaru said quietly. She nuzzled the back of ChibiUsa&#39;s neck.
ChibiUsa shuddered lightly when she felt Hotaru kiss her nape.
&quot;Other couples kiss in public, so why don&#39;t we?&quot; she asked
innocently.
        &quot;Hotaru, can we talk about this later?&quot; ChibiUsa asked
nervously.
        &quot;You&#39;re so cute when you&#39;re shy,&quot; whispered Hotaru. She
reluctantly took a step back.
        ChibiUsa turned around to face her. &quot;You look beautiful in
your school uniform,&quot; she said quietly.
        &quot;So do you,&quot; replied Hotaru.
        ChibiUsa gave Hotaru a quick kiss. She smiled at her lover
and best friend. &quot;You&#39;re so kawaii, Taru-chan.&quot; Hotaru smiled back
at her.
        &quot;I&#39;ve got class now, but I&#39;ll see you soon, ChibiUsa-chan,&quot;
said Hotaru. She kissed ChibiUsa on the cheek. ChibiUsa caught her
hand as she turned to leave.
        &quot;Hotaru-chan, could you spend the night at my house tonight?&quot;
ChibiUsa asked. &quot;Ikuko, Kenji, and Shingo are going to visit some
relatives, and Usagi&#39;s with Mamoru, so I&#39;d feel lonely all by
myself.&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;d love to, Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru said happily. ChibiUsa
squeezed her hand before letting go. Hotaru blew a kiss to her from
across the crowded hall and then headed to her class. ChibiUsa
looked around nervously. Luckily, her opened locker had blocked
the two girls from view of the other classmates.
        ChibiUsa sighed contentedly and turned back to her locker.
&#39;I&#39;m so lucky to have Hotaru,&#39; thought ChibiUsa. She put her shoes
in the locker, but noticed something already inside. It was an odd
pair of slippers. They were a pair of sexy, high-heeled,
feather-trimmed bedroom slippers with pink crystals. She was puzzled.
Hotaru had gotten to school shortly after she had, so she knew that
it couldn&#39;t have been her girlfriend who placed them there. The
slippers would fit perfectly with the nightie she had bought several
days ago. It had been one of the most embarrassing moments of her
life when she&#39;d bought it. As soon as she saw it, she knew that
Hotaru would like it. She had wanted to surprise Hotaru with it when
the two of them were alone. The slippers would make a great
finishing touch. She looked around to make sure nobody was looking
and put the slippers into her backpack. She smiled to herself as she
thought about being alone with Hotaru that night. She hurried off to
class happily.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Hotaru sat in class thinking to herself. Things had been so
tiring lately. Luckily, there seemed to be a lull in the continuing
challenges the Sailor Senshi met with. Unfortunately for Hotaru, she
and ChibiUsa were quite a bit younger than their other
teammates. Whereas the rest of the Senshi had gotten past high
school, Hotaru and ChibiUsa had to keep studying for the high school
entrance exams. Hotaru was a good student and ChibiUsa was really
trying, but it was easy for the two of them to get sidetracked when
they were alone studying. Hotaru blushed as she remembered the last
time she and ChibiUsa had tried to study. Hotaru didn&#39;t want to be
in class at the moment. She wanted to be with her love. She sighed
and tried to concentrate on class, but her mind kept drifting back
to ChibiUsa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        ChibiUsa and Hotaru made their way to ChibiUsa&#39;s house. They
walked along holding hands, deep in conversation. Suddenly, Hotaru
smiled at ChibiUsa. The smile reminded ChibiUsa of when Hotaru had
been Mistress 9. &quot;Isn&#39;t that Usagi and Mamoru?&quot; asked Hotaru.
        ChibiUsa looked around and tried to spot them. Hotaru pushed
her surprised girlfriend up against a nearby shop&#39;s window. The people
walking by sweatdropped as the pink haired girl struggled against her
lover&#39;s passionate kiss. &quot;Mmmphh....mmmmm...&quot; Hotaru&#39;s hand stroked
ChibiUsa&#39;s soft cheek. She finally pulled away from ChibiUsa.
Th pink haired girl was gasping for air and blushing deeply.
&quot;Taru-chan...&quot; she started.
She looked around for Mamoru and Usagi.
        Hotaru giggled. &quot;They&#39;re not here, Odango-chan. I just like
keeping you on your toes.&quot;
        ChibiUsa breathed a sigh of relief.
        &quot;On the other hand, that doesn&#39;t mean that I won&#39;t do the
same thing if I do happen to see them,&quot; Hotaru added mischievously.
        &quot;I remember you being the shy one when we first met,&quot; said
ChibiUsa as she fixed the bow on the front of her blouse.
        &quot;I don&#39;t see why you should be shy about the one you love.
You&#39;re everything to me and I don&#39;t want to pretend otherwise. I
don&#39;t understand why you&#39;re so shy about the two of us,&quot; said
Hotaru exasperated.
     &quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; ChibiUsa trailed off as they continued
walking. ChibiUsa tried to make sense of how she felt, so she
could explain her reasons to Hotaru. She looked over at the
dark haired girl hopelessly. &#39;I love her so much, so why am
I afraid of everyone knowing? She&#39;s my the most important thing in
my life, but I act like we&#39;re just friends. Why?&#39; &quot;I&#39;m afraid,
Hotaru. I&#39;m afraid of what will happen if everyone knows. Things
have been happening so fast and I feel like if we hold on to how
things were, we&#39;ll be alright. I don&#39;t know how to handle
everything. My parents are in the future, and I don&#39;t even know
if Setsuna will let you go back with me, and I can&#39;t tell them
without you.&quot;
    &quot;But you wouldn&#39;t go without me,&quot; Hotaru said, staring directly
at ChibiUsa, causing the pink haired girl to laugh nervously. &quot;And
if you tell Mamoru and Usagi now, then won&#39;t they know about the
two of us since before you were born? You&#39;d grow up with them
knowing about us. Maybe that&#39;s why they sent you back here,&quot; Hotaru
said helpfully.
     &quot;I&#39;m not sure. Wouldn&#39;t I have noticed if my parents knew I was
going to get with the Senshi of Death and Rebirth in the past?&quot;
ChibiUsa asked.
     &quot;No offense, Odango-chan, but you&#39;re not exactly the most
perceptive girl I know. You didn&#39;t notice the way I looked at you
from time to time,&quot; Hotaru said. Her hand rested gently on the pink
haired girl&#39;s shoulder.
     ChibiUsa&#39;s mood brightened as she lay her hand atop Hotaru&#39;s.
&quot;That&#39;s only because I didn&#39;t want to. I had to wait until you were
mature enough to handle a deeper relationship,&quot; ChibiUsa argued
playfully.
     Hotaru smiled at ChibiUsa. &quot;Please don&#39;t say I have to wait
until you&#39;re mature enough to tell everyone. And I think I&#39;ve been
ready to handle a relationship with you even before I had to reage.
I thought about you all the time. I still do.&quot;
        &quot;I think it would have been a little strange if two
eight-year olds were going out,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
        &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Hotaru squeezed ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulder gently.
&quot;I would have thought it was fun to be girlfriends back then. And
you were looking for romance, anyway, so I think it would have
worked rather well.&quot; Hotaru looked thoughtful. &quot;I might have to ask
Setsuna-mama about that.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        They stopped off at Hotaru&#39;s house before continuing on to
ChibiUsa&#39;s. Hotaru picked up a few things and asked her parents if
she could spend the night with ChibiUsa.
        &quot;Thanks for coming over, Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said as she
unlocked the door.
        &quot;I&#39;m just glad to be here with you,&quot; Hotaru said, leaning
forward and kissing ChibiUsa softly on the lips. They left their
shoes by the door and went to ChibiUsa&#39;s room. Hotaru sat down on
the bed and straightened out her skirt. ChibiUsa sat on Hotaru&#39;s lap,
facing the dark haired girl.
        &quot;Don&#39;t worry about a thing, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa. Her hand
went up to the side of Hotaru&#39;s face, gently stroking her cheek.
&quot;Things have been so hectic lately. All I want to think about tonight
is you. I&#39;ll cook us a romantic dinner later and afterwards I have a
surprise.&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;ll cook for us, Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru said hastily. She
knew the little pink haired girl put her heart in it, but she just
wasn&#39;t good at cooking. She was actually very dangerous in the
kitchen. Hotaru always ate what ChibiUsa made for her for her
Odango-chan&#39;s  sake, but she&#39;d much prefer cooking herself if given
the chance. &#39;Okay, maybe I&#39;m exaggerating,&#39; Hotaru thought, &#39;But I&#39;d
still rather cook for the two of us.&#39;
        &quot;I can do that, Hotaru. I want to make sure everything&#39;s
perfect tonight. Just being here with you makes me feel hundreds of
times better than I did earlier,&quot; ChibiUsa said, looking deeply into
Hotaru&#39;s dark purple eyes.
        &quot;But I want to. Let&#39;s both make tonight a romantic night,&quot;
Hotaru said softly. Hotaru&#39;s fingers brushed through ChibiUsa&#39;s soft,
pink hair. Hotaru&#39;s heart started to beat faster as ChibiUsa leaned
forward and kissed her. Hotaru kissed ChibiUsa back, feeling
ChibiUsa&#39;s sweet lips against her own. ChibiUsa parted Hotaru&#39;s
lips with her tongue as the two girls continued to kiss passionately.
        &quot;I love you, Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily after they
broke the kiss.
        Hotaru smiled. &quot;I love hearing you say that. I love you too,
ChibiUsa-chan. Now what was that surprise you were talking about?&quot;
Hotaru asked curiously.
        &quot;I was going to wait until after dinner, but I&#39;ll go get it
now.&quot; ChibiUsa gave Hotaru a quick kiss before standing up. &quot;I hope
you like it.&quot;
        &quot;As long as it involves you, I&#39;m sure I will,&quot; the dark
haired girl said playfully, her eyes following ChibiUsa&#39;s every
movement as she walked out of her room after putting something
in her backpack and picked it up.
        Hotaru dimmed all the lights in the room as soon as ChibiUsa
was gone. When they&#39;d stopped at her house, she&#39;d made sure to get
some candles and her violin. She knew that ChibiUsa had her own plans
for the night, but she wanted to help.
        &#39;I wonder what she&#39;s up to,&#39; Hotaru thought as she placed the
candles around the room. &#39;I&#39;m glad we decided not to spend tonight
studying. I don&#39;t want to waste any of the time I have alone with
ChibiUsa.&#39; She began lighting the candles. &#39;I hope she comes down
soon. I want to see her.&#39; She closed her eyes partway. &#39;I want to
hold her. I love being so close to her. She&#39;s been the most important
thing in my life since I met her, and now I can show her that.&#39;
Hotaru sighed happily, thinking of her beautiful pink haired goddess.
She picked up her violin and started to play. The melody was slow
and soft, reminding Hotaru of previous romantic moments with ChibiUsa.

        ChibiUsa took off her clothes and pulled her nightie and the
slippers out of her backpack. She looked at the nightie nervously. It
was light pink and silk. It left much of her long arms and legs bare,
ending mid thigh. She pulled it over her head. It got caught briefly
on her odango before she managed to pull it down. She brushed her
fingers through her hair to try to get it back in order. She had been
thinking about getting rid of the hair style she&#39;d had since she was
a little girl and letting her hair grow longer, putting it in two tails.
She&#39;d talked to Hotaru about it, but the dark haired girl had told her
she wanted ChibiUsa to keep her hair the way it was, in its shorter
style. The cool cloth against her bare skin brought her out of her
reverie. She picked up one of the slippers and put it on. A
strange feeling washed over ChibiUsa as she was putting on the second
one. She wasn&#39;t nervous about Hotaru seeing her in what she was wearing
any longer.
She wanted Hotaru to see her. She wanted to make the most of her
night with Hotaru. As ChibiUsa walked out of the bathroom, she could
hear the soft sound of violin music coming from her room. &#39;It sounds
so romantic,&#39; she thought as she walked towards her room. ChibiUsa
loved to hear Hotaru play the violin.
        ChibiUsa walked into her room. It was lit only by candles
placed around the room. Hotaru continued to play, her eyes half
closed as she concentrated.
        ChibiUsa stepped up behind Hotaru. Her arms encircled
Hotaru&#39;s waist. A smile formed across Hotaru&#39;s lips as she kept on
playing. ChibiUsa kissed Hotaru&#39;s cheek, her chin resting on Hotaru&#39;s
shoulder. ChibiUsa&#39;s right hand went up to Hotaru&#39;s chin. She turned
Hotaru&#39;s face towards her. Her lips brushed Hotaru&#39;s lightly before
meeting again more passionately. ChibiUsa&#39;s other hand started to
roam Hotaru&#39;s body. Hotaru gasped as ChibiUsa&#39;s hand ran along her
thigh. ChibiUsa&#39;s right hand went slowly down from Hotaru&#39;s chin, her
fingertip lightly sliding down Hotaru&#39;s neck. Her hand stopped at one
of Hotaru&#39;s breasts. She cupped Hotaru&#39;s breast through the thin
cloth of Hotaru&#39;s shirt.
        &quot;I love you, Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa whispered as she kissed
Hotaru&#39;s ear. ChibiUsa&#39;s hand disappeared under Hotaru&#39;s skirt. The
dark haired girl moaned softly in reply.
        &quot;Aishiteru, ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru said. ChibiUsa pulled Hotaru&#39;s
shirt up over her head. Hotaru turned around to face ChibiUsa. She
smiled as she looked up and down at ChibiUsa&#39;s nightie and slippers.
ChibiUsa blushed. &quot;You look so cute, Odango-chan.&quot;
        ChibiUsa pouted. &quot;I&#39;m not supposed to look cute, Taru. I&#39;m
supposed to look sexy for you.&quot;
        Hotaru stepped closer, her hands running along ChibiUsa&#39;s
bare arms. &quot;You don&#39;t understand. You&#39;re my little Odango-chan. You
are cute. And sexy. I can&#39;t help it if I love how kawaii you are.&quot;
Hotaru rubbed some of the cloth between her fingers, gently touching
ChibiUsa as she did so. &quot;I&#39;m really glad you wore this, but I&#39;d like
to see what you look like without it.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s hands went down to
ChibiUsa&#39;s legs. She ran her hands up ChibiUsa&#39;s thighs and under her
nightie. Hotaru gently pulled the nightie up across ChibiUsa&#39;s body,
her hands caressing the other girl&#39;s gentle curves. Hotaru looked
ChibiUsa up and down. The pink haired girl was naked except for the
bedroom slippers she wore. She had almost gotten over being shy around
Hotaru, but, still, she sometimes got embarrassed when she saw Hotaru
look at her.
        &quot;See? This is much better,&quot; Hotaru said happily.
        &quot;Maybe for you,&quot; ChibiUsa said, smiling impishly, &quot;but I&#39;d
like it better if you&#39;d join me.&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;d be only too happy to, Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru said. She
unfastened her bra, before sliding her skirt and panties off.
        ChibiUsa stepped forward and kissed Hotaru again, her hands
traveling to Hotaru&#39;s chest. She cupped Hotaru&#39;s breasts. Hotaru felt
the other girl&#39;s palms press against her breasts. Hotaru loved the feel
of ChibiUsa&#39;s gentle hands against her skin. Hotaru&#39;s hands ran across
ChibiUsa&#39;s back, causing the small pink haired girl to shiver
slightly from the sensation of the dark haired girl&#39;s fingertips
against her back. She kissed ChibiUsa, her hands resting on ChibiUsa&#39;s
rear. ChibiUsa caressed slightly pale skin of her lover&#39;s breasts,
feeling Hotaru&#39;s hardening nipples against her hands. ChibiUsa pushed
Hotaru back onto the bed. ChibiUsa crawled on after her, kissing
Hotaru&#39;s soft lips as she settled atop her dark haired lover.
        &quot;You&#39;re so pretty, Taru,&quot; ChibiUsa said softly. She pushed
some of the sweat dampened hair away from Hotaru&#39;s eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so
glad you&#39;re mine.&quot;
        &quot;I&#39;m glad to know that you&#39;re my Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru leaned
up to kiss ChibiUsa again. &quot;Now why are you acting so frisky today?
Not that I mind, but it&#39;s not like it&#39;s been very long since we&#39;ve
been together.&quot;
        ChibiUsa hand went between Hotaru&#39;s legs. She gently began
to caress Hotaru&#39;s lower lips. &quot;I just realized how beautiful you
are.&quot;
        One of Hotaru&#39;s hands went up to ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts. She
stroked one of ChibiUsa&#39;s nipples between two of her fingers. &quot;You&#39;re
pretty cute, yourself,&quot; Hotaru whispered as her hand went down
ChibiUsa&#39;s stomach. ChibiUsa continued to rub Hotaru&#39;s womanhood as
she felt Hotaru&#39;s fingers brush her own. Hotaru moaned as ChibiUsa
found her clitoris. ChibiUsa stroked Hotaru&#39;s pearl causing pleasure
to course through the dark haired girl&#39;s body. ChibiUsa moaned
lightly as she felt Hotaru&#39;s fingers push into her. Hotaru made
shallow strokes into ChibiUsa&#39;s vagina.
        &quot;Taru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa moaned as Hotaru picked up the tempo
of her strokes.
        Hotaru panted. She was having a hard time concentrating on
anything other than the pleasant sensations she was getting from
ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers.
        ChibiUsa kissed Hotaru&#39;s shoulder before moving downwards
toward Hotaru&#39;s breasts. She kissed the tender flesh as her other
hand went to Hotaru&#39;s left breast, rubbing the soft skin there. ChibiUsa
licked Hotaru&#39;s nipple several times before starting to suckle it.
        Hotaru put a hand on ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulder and pushed forward.
Both girls sat up. Hotaru gingerly kissed ChibiUsa&#39;s neck. Both of
them continued on with their fingers as their free hands roamed
along the other&#39;s body. They kissed again and again as the two girls
continued to build up towards their climaxes. Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s
wet fingers pinch her clitoris lightly before stroking it again.
        ChibiUsa felt Hotaru&#39;s fingers inside her. Hotaru&#39;s slender
fingers continued to press into her. ChibiUsa was near her edge. She
tried to bring Hotaru along with her, but she knew she probably
wouldn&#39;t make it. As ChibiUsa nearly reached her limit, she felt a slight
surge through her, helping her to keep going. She and Hotaru met in
another kiss. ChibiUsa&#39;s free hand cupped one of Hotaru&#39;s breasts as
she continued to stroke the dark haired girl. Hotaru moaned as they
kissed. Both girls tensed as they reached orgasm.
        ChibiUsa and Hotaru laid back on the bed, exhausted. ChibiUsa
slid the slippers off. Strangely, she didn&#39;t hear them hit the floor.
She lay back atop Hotaru, one of her legs between Hotaru&#39;s and her
head on the other girl&#39;s soft breasts. ChibiUsa pulled up the sheet
around the two of them. Hotaru brushed some of the damp hair away
from ChibiUsa&#39;s face. She kissed her gently on the forehead. Neither
girl said a word. They kept on looking into the other&#39;s eyes, kissing
and touching each other occasionally.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Neo Queen Serenity smiled as she kept her back turned to the
crystal ball. She was waiting to find out who would get the slippers
next. She was glad her slippers had managed to help her daughter and
her girlfriend. She&#39;d thought the slippers had been a good idea in
the first place, but after the few times she&#39;d sent them already, she
knew that this was just what she and her friends (and this time, her
daughter) needed during that dark time. She turned around to see the
image of her daughter and Hotaru fade, and change to the new location
of the slippers.
