<h1>Conversations (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Haruka let her fingers play across the keyboard, not striking the 
keys, simply acknowledging them. The music flowed through her head, a 
tangible thing in the nearly empty room. Empty, that is, but for the 
piano, her futon, and the figure that lay upon it - the figure she now 
ignored.

Haruka let the music drive the memory of the last 18 hours out of her 
mind. She did not glance over to where the sleeping figure lay, or 
think about the unconscious body she had carried home last night, 
bloody and bruised. She did not think of the rapidly healing wounds, 
the fever, the night sweats and dementia, the moment of exquisite 
tenderness as this strange girl, her eyes fevered, had reached out for 
her, begging her not to leave. Haruka had held her then, wondering 
whom it was this slight girl could love with so great a passion that 
she would cry out, even in her dreams.

Now Haruka refused to remember that moment during the depths of the 
night when the girl&#39;s fever peaked. Looking down, she had seen the 
girl&#146;s brow drenched in sweat, eyes burning with confusion and pain. A 
slender, graceful hand had reached out of this special madness. The 
hand had brushed her lips, her face, pushing hair out of her eyes, and 
the voice, so soft, so kind it hurt to hear, had said, &quot;I love you&#133;&quot; 
Haruka hadn&#39;t been able to breathe, had felt the most amazing envy for 
the true recipient of this emotion. The girl&#39;s blue eyes had relaxed 
and closed then, as the fever broke, and as she fell into peaceful 
sleep, the word had come, almost inaudible. &quot;Haruka.&quot;

But Haruka would not think of that. Nor would she remember the boy who 
became a monster, the overwhelming need to fight it, the sense of 
outrage that something so unnatural would invade her city, her planet. 
She would not wonder at the wand that appeared magically before her, 
nor at the appearance of this girl, and her miraculous transformation 
into a sailor-suited superheroine. She refused to even think of her 
own pain, her own flight from her destiny. No, all that she would 
think of, all that she would allow herself right now, was the music.

&quot;Do you have it?&quot; The voice was sharp, firm. Haruka&#39;s hands slipped, 
slamming into the piano keys discordantly. She turned to see the girl 
sitting up, returning her gaze coolly.

Haruka did not answer, amazed that this girl, still in a blood-stained 
school uniform, could be so in control, so commanding.

&quot;Do you have it?&#39; she demanded, her eyes blazing.

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka had not imagined their next conversation would be so 
disconcerting.

&quot;The wand! The wand - where is it?&quot; The girl&#39;s voice was not 
emotional, but insistent.

&quot;I&#133;I don&#39;t know where it is.&quot; Haruka attempted to explain, but it was 
hard to remember just what had happened. Everything had moved so 
quickly&#133;&quot;I looked for it, but it was gone.&quot;

&quot;Gone.&quot; The word was not a question. The girl&#39;s eyes closed. Her face 
became calmer and when she again looked at Haruka, she smiled a cold, 
distant smile. &quot;Call it.&quot;

&quot;Wait a second!&quot; Haruka had had about enough. &quot;Who are you? What is 
going on here? And by the way, &#39;Thank you very much for taking care of 
me while I was ill, Tenoh Haruka-san.&#39;&quot;

The girl smiled at Haruka&#39;s outrage, but she bowed. &quot;Thank you very 
much.&quot; Her face became serious. &quot;But we don&#39;t have time for this&#133;&quot; 
pushing aside the bedclothes, the girl - Kaioh Michiru, Haruka 
grudgingly acknowledged the girl&#39;s name - stood up with alacrity. She 
moved fast enough to make Haruka dizzy, and before she could stop 
herself, Haruka found herself halfway to the door. She opened her 
mouth, but Michiru&#39;s voice stopped her.

&quot;We *don&#39;t* have time for this, Haruka-san.&quot; And they were out into 
the hall, down the elevator and on the street.

Before Haruka had time to get her bearings, Michiru had pulled her 
into an empty lot. From the looks of things construction had begun 
there, but never been finished. The rotten metal carcass of an 
abandoned building shielded them from prying eyes.

Michiru rounded on Haruka, her eyes shining. Haruka wondered if the 
fever had left the gir.., Michiru, damaged in some way. Haruka 
affected a cool demeanor, crossing her arms and waiting for Michiru to 
speak.

&quot;Call it.&quot; 

Haruka stared down at Michiru, acting with a nonchalance she did not 
feel at all. Her heart beat so loudly, it was a wonder Michiru did not 
comment on it. Haruka felt dizzy, as if she was carrying too heavy a 
load for too long, but she ground out the words, &quot;Not until you tell 
me what this is about.&quot;

Michiru began to open her mouth, but stopped, pressed her lips 
together tightly and turned away. It was a moment before she spoke.

&quot;I won&#39;t. You already know what this is about.&quot;

&quot;But yesterday,&quot; Haruka found herself sweating with the effort to 
remain calm, Something inside her head pounded against her skull, 
clamoring to be born. She was deathly afraid that once she gave in, 
she would never be in control of herself again. &quot;Yesterday you told me 
not to touch it&#133;&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was impossibly sad. &quot;I know what I said. I 
was being selfish. I didn&#39;t want you to have to share this burden. But 
today&#133;&quot; she spun around and Haruka was shocked to see tears on her 
face, &quot;today I&#39;m even more selfish. I want, I need your help, Tenoh 
Haruka&#133; please, call it.&quot; She lowered her eyes to the pavement, 
refusing to meet Haruka&#39;s gaze.

Without conscious thought, with hardly a movement at all, Haruka found 
herself holding the wand in her hand. She glanced at its blue and gold 
exterior, she felt its weight, its solidity. Looking at the girl in 
front of her Haruka knew suddenly, exactly what she had to do. As she 
lifted the pen over her head, she could feel the tension, the fear 
wash away in her new understanding. And she could see the relief that 
washed Michiru&#39;s face clean of years of care and worry.

&quot;Uranus Planet Power, Make-up!&quot; The words came to her lips as if she 
had said them a thousand times. Maybe she had. The rush, the whirlwind 
of transformation, left her breathless, yet energized, as if the world 
itself was no obstacle at all.

&quot;That&#133;was&#133;in..credible!&quot; Haruka gasped, as she stood, dazed, in the 
middle of an abandoned lot. Her previous understanding of metal, of 
the air, of sound had changed as well. She could hear the various 
vehicles outside, she could sense the presence of the people that 
walked down the street past the lot, unaware of the miracle within. 
She looked at her hands, the sailor suit that she wore, and the boots 
on her feet. When she looked at Michiru once more, she could see the 
color in her cheeks, the excitement&#133;and pleasure, in her eyes.

&quot;Incredible!&quot; Haruka repeated. &quot;Is it always like that? That was 
unbelievable!&quot; She moved her arms and legs, wanting to run, to jump, 
to land, just to feel the power her body now had.

For the first time since they had met, Haruka heard Michiru laugh. The 
sound was enough to bring her up short. She glanced at sparkling blue 
eyes and found herself, unaccountably, blushing.

&quot;So, does everything feel this, this amazing?&quot; Haruka asked, trying to 
draw attention away from her warmed cheeks.

The smaller girl nodded. &quot;Everything.&quot; she said, then smirked. Haruka 
looked at her, puzzled, then she realized what Michiru had meant. 
Haruka spun away, as her face flamed with an amazing variety of 
emotions.

A surge of power brought her back, as if a giant had laid its hand 
upon her and spun her around. Haruka gazed at Michiru, as she lifted 
her own henshin wand, and this time, Haruka was able to see her 
transform, naked in silhouette, the great rush of water that left her, 
not Kaioh Michiru, but Sailor Neptune.

Haruka, no, Sailor Uranus, stepped back, then stood, firm. She knew 
what her past had been, and now, finally, she accepted her destiny.

Smiling, she took a step forward. &quot;What&#39;s next, sempai?&quot;

Sailor Neptune laughed. &quot;Your attack.&quot;

&quot;Attack?&quot; Haruka had never considered this. She had pretty fair 
hand-to-hand fighting skills. But that wouldn&#39;t do against a 
supernatural monster. &quot;What do I&#133;&quot; Her hand lifted in defiance, and as 
she slammed it into the ground, she heard herself screaming, with a 
controlled anger that seemed to echo out of the past, &quot;World Shaking!&quot; 
Her hand hit the ground and a golden sphere of light ground its way 
through the rubble of the lot, bursting into a million glowing shards 
that completely destroyed a tumulus of rusty I-beams.

&quot;Oh my God.&quot; Haruka whispered, one hand covering her mouth, one still 
clenched. &quot;Oh my God&#133;Michiru, Michiru, did you see that?&quot; She turned, 
caught the look the other girl gave her and found herself rushing to 
embrace the smaller girl. &quot;Michiru? Did you see that?&quot;

Laughing, crying, relief flooding her limbs and making them weak, 
Michiru embraced Haruka and shouted that she had, she had seen it.

Haruka&#146;s joy was quickly muted, as she realized the desctructive power 
she now commanded. Was this why she was born? To destroy things, 
people, with the power of the quaking earth? Was this what she really 
wanted?

Michiru watched her solemnly, not willing to shepherd her through this 
crisis. Haruka was aware, suddenly, that Michiru had also gone through 
this - the comprehension of exactly what it meant to be a soldier. And 
she had faced it alone. Haruka&#146;s respect for her grew. A thought came 
to her, an understanding that in the past they had been partners, and 
that their fates were now intertwined.

Haruka looked at her hands, wondering how much blood she might get on 
them, then looked up at Michiru. Despite the burden she had just 
accepted, when she saw Michiru smile, Haruka knew that her decision 
had been made.

It was several hours later, after the they had utterly exhausted 
themselves delving into Haruka&#39;s powers, that two girls could be seen 
leaving the abandoned lot. They walked down the street in perfect 
understanding. Whatever was to happen, even if they faced death 
itself, they knew that they would find the Talismans, find the Messiah 
and save the world from the Silence that threatened. 

And for the first time in her life, Tenoh Haruka knew exactly what she 
had to do.
