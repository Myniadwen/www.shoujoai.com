Rei walked back to her apartment after a long hard day on second shift. 
It was late in the evening and there was a full moon in the sky casting 
its pale light over the badly lit, and rather decrepit, street she was 
travelling along. Graffiti adorned many of the buildings&#39; walls the girl 
passed and rotting garbage was liberally littered about the footpath... 
which the Fire Senshi was careful to step around. This was a dangerous 
part of town and Rei knew it; but she didn&#39;t care. She was the Senshi of 
Fire, after all. Any unsavoury types who dared to confront her would be 
in for the worst night of their pathetic lives. And in her current mood, 
she wouldn&#39;t pull any punches.

If Rei had to pour one more cup of coffee today she was going to go 
insane. Being a waitress in a busy restaurant was a pretty tough job. 
She wondered if she would get repetitive stress disorder from excessive 
pouring. Otaku had been out in force that afternoon, and had ordered so 
much coffee from the miko, that she thought they would be hyper from all 
the caffeine for the rest of the week. And all to just get Rei&#146;s 
attention, and then proceed to drool at the sight of her close 
proximity. The Fire Senshi&#146;s short temper had been tested to its very 
limits.

Rei couldn&#39;t wait to get back to the apartment building and take a long, 
hot, relaxing shower, then call it a night at last. That is, unless 
Tsubasa pulled his oh-so-funny prank again by using all of the hot water 
up just before she arrived. Though, after the chewing out Rei had given 
him the last time, he would have to have a death wish to do so again. 
She hated sharing a bathroom, but at least Tsubasa knew what it was to 
be neat and tidy... thank the gods. If she had to share a bathroom with 
a messy person on top of an annoying one, she didn&#146;t think she would be 
able to stand it.

The fluttering of feathery wings startled Rei out of her reverie. She 
looked up and saw a couple of crows settling down for the night on a 
building&#39;s ledge. They reminded the miko of her own birds, Phobus and 
Deimos, back at the Hikawa Jinja. She hoped her Grandpa was taking good 
care of them. Rei continued to look up at the sky as she walked, gazing 
at the full moon with forlorn eyes.

&quot;A permanent reminder of her,&quot; Rei sighed heavily.

Rei lowered her eyes down to the pavement in front of her and shoved her 
hands into her jacket pockets. How very bland her life had become. She 
had no purpose anymore, no reason to go on. The light of her life was 
gone... though it had been for the best. But was this how it was always 
going to be from now on? Working in a dead end job by day, and staying 
in a tiny &#145;apartment&#146; by night... where the slightest thing reminded her 
of whom she had left behind and consequently caused her to be miserable 
for the rest of the day? Was this to be Rei&#146;s life now?

Rei thought that maybe she could go back to school in Yokohama to reduce 
the tedium of her new life. She had simply abandoned high school when 
she had left Tokyo. She had a false name now and no parents to back her 
up. However, Makoto had more or less done it... except for the false 
name part... so why couldn&#39;t she? Though, any school she tried to attend 
would probably want her old school records or something....

The Fire Senshi was suddenly snapped out of her thoughts by a strange 
noise ahead of her. &quot;Probably just a rat,&quot; she murmured to herself, 
though she did walk a little more cautiously up the street.

Rei stopped when she came to a dark alley to her right and carefully 
peered into its dim gloom. All the miko could make out initially, was a 
dumpster, several trashcans, and piles of garbage that didn&#39;t quite make 
it into the cans. She was positive the sound had come from this 
direction. Yeah, right. Like she was going to actually go down a dark, 
spooky alley in the middle of the night... *and* in a rough 
neighbourhood no less... just to investigate a strange noise. Rei *had* 
been to the movies.

Rei began to walk off again, but quickly halted when she heard the noise 
again. It sounded like... it sounded like somebody crying. Somebody 
could be hurt and in trouble. Or, it could be some junkie needing a fix. 
It was a bad neighbourhood after all. Rei debated with herself for a 
couple of seconds, and then sighed resignedly. &quot;Damn it,&quot; she swore, 
before warily entering the alley.

The Fire Senshi hastily covered her mouth and nose with her hand as the 
odour of the place became apparent. Augh, this alley was filthy! Not to 
mention that the smells from all kinds of putrid garbage were utterly 
rank and nearly overpowering! There were probably whole swarms of 
cockroaches just waiting for the right time to ambush Rei. The miko just 
hoped that they were currently tied up fighting with the alley&#146;s rodent 
population, instead.

Rei slowly made her way deeper into the alley, carefully picking her 
steps for maximum stealth--and to prevent getting any refuse on her 
shoes--her breathing becoming shallow and quick as adrenaline started to 
pump through her veins. It was all right; there was nothing for her to 
be scared of. The noise Rei heard was probably just her imagination... 
nobody horrendously disfigured was going to jump out of the shadows and 
axe murder her or anything....

Rei&#146;s paranoid thoughts were cut short as the sound she had heard 
earlier reached her ears once again. She strained to listen, trying to 
pick up what the noise was exactly. It sounded like something was being 
scraped against a brick wall of the alley. But there was something 
else... it was almost like someone was humming. That couldn&#146;t be right, 
humming? Rei shook her head slightly at the thought. No, it couldn&#146;t be.

Rei moved a little closer to the source of the noise, while attempting 
to make out the dark shapes in the murky shadows. She saw what looked to 
be two figures. One appeared to be a homeless woman, who was sitting 
against the wall of the alley, moving feebly. The other was vastly 
different. It was humanoid in form but was bulky, like someone who had 
done very heavy weight training all of his or her life. Rei squinted her 
eyes, trying to see more details of the larger figure. It was wearing 
something on its head... some sort of weird hat. It stood over the 
sitting woman, one of its broad hands covering her face, which caused 
her moaning to be muffled making her sound like she was humming. The 
still shadowed figure didn&#39;t notice Rei&#39;s presence, nor could the 
raven-haired girl make it out fully, but what she did see was enough. It 
was obviously not on the side of the good. She had to do something... 
Rei&#146;s mouth curled into a grim half-smile... something like throwing a 
few Fire Souls at the scumbag.

As the Fire Senshi prepared to transform into her alter ego, she 
hesitated. Rei couldn&#39;t transform into Sailor Mars. Sailor Mars was 
supposed to be dead. If the bulky thing with the odd hat escaped or the 
woman recognised her, Rei&#39;s secret would be out. Sailor Mars was a 
well-known figure in Tokyo and she was sure that her fame had spread all 
over Japan, or at the very least, to Yokohama. Maybe Rei could take down 
the bruiser without transforming. She wasn&#146;t exactly helpless as just 
her normal self. The miko then mentally chastised herself. Come on, a 
woman&#146;s life was in danger; she couldn&#146;t hold back... perhaps... Yes, 
Minako had had a mask when she had transformed into Sailor V during her 
younger days; maybe Rei could do something similar. But how had the 
blonde done that?

Rei swallowed a gasp as the bulky figure pulled the woman&#39;s face towards 
him and then pushed viciously forwards, smashing the back of her head 
against the brick alley wall with a sickening thud. The woman&#146;s body 
jerked once, then stopped moving altogether, falling totally limp. Rei 
didn&#146;t have time to hold a summit meeting in her head! She had wasted 
enough time as it was! She would just try to will her Sailor fuku to 
change into something different. She could add a mask or something 
similar like Sailor V... or Tuxedo Kamen. With those thoughts held in 
her mind, the miko transformed, shouting out her command words loudly 
and breaking the silence of the night.

&quot;MARS CRYSTAL POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

As Rei felt her senshi fuku take form around her, she willed it to 
alter. There was a slight pause in the transformation sequence and then 
it continued. The Senshi of Fire felt her legs and arms being covered 
and then something slide over her face. It was all over in a split 
second.

At the sound of the miko&#146;s shout, the figure let go of the woman&#146;s face, 
whose body slumped sideways onto the pavement, then stepped towards the 
now revealed Sailor Mars.

With her eyes now completely adjusted to the darkness and in range of 
the figure, Sailor Mars could now see that this was no big body-builder 
bullying a woman. Nor was it wearing a hat. The creature stood a head 
taller than Mars and possessed distinctly bestial features. Its lower 
body was covered in a thick silvery fur, while it&#39;s upper-half was 
hairless and the colour of raw skin. Two entwined antlers sprouted from 
the top of its head. Its characteristics made it look positively demonic 
and obviously not human. It was a youma.

Sailor Mars moved into a combat stance, positioning her feet firmly on 
the ground and bringing up her loosely clenched fists. &quot;I am Sai-- um... 
I&#39;m...&quot; Mars&#146; speech faltered when she realised she didn&#39;t actually know 
how to refer to herself. &quot;I am a fighter of justice!&quot; the Fire Senshi 
quickly recovered. &quot;You will pay for hurting a defenceless woman!&quot;

The creature, the youma, seemed quite unperturbed by the miko&#146;s stern 
declaration. In fact, it looked rather pleased. A sinister smile almost 
split its face in half. &quot;A fighter,&quot; it hissed, a forked tongue flicking 
out its mouth, &quot;then fight, fighter!!&quot;

The youma roared out a battle cry as it charged at Sailor Mars, its 
heavy footfalls shooting a web of cracks out along the concrete pavement 
with each step. Mars instantly darted to her right, leaping agilely onto 
the dumpster nearby. The youma swiftly responded with a swipe at Mars&#39; 
legs with a taloned hand, attempting to take her feet from under her and 
deposit her flat on her back.

However, the Senshi of Fire had other ideas. She bounded upwards and 
grabbed the last rung of a fire escape ladder to dodge the attack. Then 
she swung her body outwards before letting go of the ladder to land 
behind the youma. Mars whirled around on the youma&#39;s now vulnerable 
back. As she prepared to launch a fireball... she hesitated; her powers 
would identify her as Sailor Mars. But there was no other choice. 
Besides, her adversary wouldn&#146;t be telling anyone what it had seen once 
she was through with it! Unfortunately, Sailor Mars&#39; hesitation was 
enough to give the youma an opening.

The monster lashed out brutally behind it with a furred leg, catching 
the unsure girl in the sternum. The &#39;Fighter of Justice&#39; was hurled 
backwards to land in a spongy trash mound at the end of the alley.

Thankfully, the cushioning helped to soften the impact... but it did 
nothing to prevent the pain coming from Sailor Mars&#39; chest. She silently 
gasped as she tried to force air back into her evacuated lungs.

The youma turned around to take advantage of her vulnerable position, 
bolting for Sailor Mars with a furious bellow, its maw elongating to a 
length that hardly seemed possible. It was as if the monster was going 
to attempt to swallow her whole.

When the creature was almost upon her, Mars forced her hurting body into 
action and rolled to her left, before struggling to her feet. She 
hurriedly ran forward as best she could, needing to put some distance 
between herself and her enemy.

The youma rapidly switched directions to pursue her, strings of drool 
hanging revoltingly from its mouth and trailing after it in the air.

However, before the creature could get its greedy chops on her, the Fire 
Senshi jumped high into the air and spun around to face her enemy:

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

The fireball launched from Mars&#39; fingertips careened straight towards 
the youma&#39;s wide-open maw.

The youma, in an astonishing display of reflexes, grabbed a nearby 
trashcan lid to shield its face from the oncoming inferno. The blazing 
sphere struck the metal instead, dispelling the flames quickly as they 
broke apart. As the Senshi of Fire landed, the beast threw the hot lid 
at her like a Frisbee, catching her by surprise.

Mars desperately moved her body, trying to angle herself in such a way 
to evade the spinning projectile, but unfortunately, she didn&#146;t react 
quite fast enough. She screamed in pain as the lid scraped against her 
tender ribs, shooting the spasms of agony straight to her brain. 
Seething, Mars clutched her throbbing side and glared at the evil 
monster. This youma was going to burn for that.

Unaware of its impending destruction, the youma laughed heartily at the 
Justice Fighter&#39;s angered scream, the noise coming from its wide open 
mouth sounding particularly strange. It then resumed its charge; no 
doubt believing that the girl was weakened and hence susceptible for 
some sort of decisive attack....

Mars pulled out an ofuda, undeterred by the sight of a fearsome monster 
swiftly bearing down on her. &quot;Rin, pyou, tou, sha, kai, jin, retsu, sai, 
zen. Akuryou taisan!&quot;

When the youma was right in front of her, Sailor Mars adroitly dove 
between its hairy legs, turned fluidly onto her back... despite the 
afterglow of hurt from her ribs... then deftly slapped the paper ward 
onto the creature&#146;s back. The youma&#39;s charge abruptly halted in mid step 
when all of its muscles were suddenly struck with paralysis.

&quot;What... have you... done?!&quot; it choked out, its distorted and now also 
immobile mouth affecting its speech to degree that it was barely 
understandable.

Sailor Mars sprung to her feet and moved in front of the frozen monster, 
smiling smugly. &quot;I&#39;ve destroyed you,&quot; Mars stated levelly.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A scorching ball of flame streaked at the creature&#146;s open mouth. This 
time the shot did not miss.

After the youma was nothing but ash, Sailor Mars hurriedly moved to the 
injured woman&#146;s side. She had cuts all over her arms, probably from the 
youma man-handling her roughly. Mars carefully felt behind her head. It 
felt moist and sticky. The woman suddenly moaned weakly and cracked open 
her eyes slowly... then shrieked at the sight of Sailor Mars.

&quot;It&#146;s okay, it&#146;s okay,&quot; said the Fire Senshi soothingly, &quot;that thing is 
gone now and I won&#39;t hurt you.&quot;

The woman continued to look at Sailor Mars warily. Mars was wondering 
what exactly her Sailor fuku looked like now. She hoped that her 
appearance wasn&#39;t what was frightening the woman. The miko rationalised 
that it was just the shock of having some ugly monster waling on her, 
followed by waking up to a weird looking stranger staring down at you.

&quot;Can you move?&quot; asked Sailor Mars. &quot;Come on, let&#146;s try.&quot; She put her 
hands under the woman&#39;s armpits and gently lifted her onto her feet.

The woman swayed unsteadily, touched the back of her head and then 
cringed. When she looked down and saw the blood staining her hand, she 
promptly passed out.

Mars caught the woman as she fell, exhaling wearily. Now she was going 
to have to carry her all the way to a hospital. What a day. Well, at 
least she didn&#39;t have to pour any more coffee. Sighing once again, 
Sailor Mars made for the nearest hospital, lugging a quite heavy woman 
in her tired arms all of the while.

******

The hospital staff looked at Sailor Mars rather strangely when she 
entered, but once they noticed that she had an injured person in her 
arms, they broke into immediate action by taking the assaulted homeless 
woman from her care.

With her work done, the Fire Senshi disappeared quickly and quietly into 
the night. Curious as to what her Sailor fuku looked like, Sailor Mars 
stopped to look at her reflection in a nearby shop window before 
detransforming. She got quite a shock. Exactly who the hell was she 
supposed to be, Tuxedo *Mars*?

Her Sailor fuku had taken on some startling changes. You couldn&#39;t even 
call it a Sailor fuku anymore. Mars had on a long, black, two-tailed 
coat with its wide collar up and buttoned in the middle over loose 
clothes. It sort of resembled a style of tuxedo, totally black, with the 
dark pants of the garb tucked into solid, similarly coloured, boots. 
Mars&#146; hair had also been bundled under a black, wide-brimmed hat. The 
crimson veil that hid the lower half of her face completed the ensemble.

&quot;Gods, no wonder everyone looked at me like I was nuts; I look like some 
formally dressed ninja,&quot; moaned Sailor Mars in dismay and embarrassment. 
&quot;&#145;The ninja of the ball.&#146; Oh, geez.&quot;

Mars wondered why this outfit had appeared. Just a mask would have been 
fine; that&#146;s all she had wanted. The Fire Senshi then punched a fist 
into her palm as it dawned on her. Damn it, this is just what she got 
when she thought about Tuxedo Kamen! Thinking about how the prince 
looked like just before she transformed must have influenced what 
changes were made to her Sailor fuku. Well, it was only this once. She 
could always change the fuku into something else more to her taste the 
next time her fiery powers were needed.

Sailor Mars got out of the sight of possible prying eyes and 
detransformed. Tsubasa had definitely better not have used up all of the 
hot water... especially after the little escapade Rei had just 
undergone. His life depended on it.

******

Khairephon slouched in his straight-backed steel chair. Was he ever 
bored. He missed his annoying sister terribly. Sure they fought like 
banshees, but that was just their way of showing affection for each 
other. Makareus and Thrinakie didn&#39;t understand; it was irritating when 
they kept separating Laodameia and himself. In unexciting little 
operations like this one, the only form of amusement Khairephon got was 
from bickering with his older sister.

Khairephon let out a fed up sigh. He was always stuck with the dull 
jobs. Thrinakie and Makareus only called on him when they needed some 
tough heads bashed in. Every other time he was brushed off and told to 
go wait somewhere out of the way or charged with some pathetic 
responsibility to make it seem like he was actually doing something 
useful. So he liked fighting, the lust for the kill. Who didn&#39;t? That 
special way blood spurted from a severed artery or the sound bones made 
when pulverised within your very own hands... that fearful and 
disbelieving look in your enemy&#146;s eyes as they realised that their life 
was about to come to an end... there was nothing in the multiverse quite 
like it. Khairephon&#146;s brothers didn&#39;t understand.

Makareus and Thrinakie always wanted to take over worlds to increase 
their empires, conquer the cities, enslave the inhabitants, and so on 
and so forth. Even Laodameia did, though her reasons for enslaving the 
populace were a little... different. Khairephon would much rather just 
systematically slaughter all of the weaker beings and put their remains 
on some gruesome display as a warning to all others who would even think 
that they could possibly defeat him.

Khairephon was tired of waiting for word from his siblings. Sure, it 
wasn&#39;t long ago that they had left, but he was growing uncomfortable in 
his human form. It felt as if his insides were trying to scratch their 
way out of his skin or like some rabid animal was imprisoned in his 
shell of humanity. Khairephon just wanted to cut loose.

Khairephon studied the youma in the large square room with him. All of 
the creatures here were loyal to him; the other small handfuls of youma 
left behind by his siblings preferred to not partake in the... 
festivities... currently underway. The room he occupied was below a rave 
nightclub purchased before Khairephon&#146;s arrival by Makareus&#39; followers. 
His older brother&#146;s youma had always been good at infiltration... the 
backstabbing sneaks... none of the conniving creatures could be trusted 
in Khairephon&#146;s opinion. He had to admit, though, that the rhythmic 
thumping from bass percussions in the dance music above them served well 
to drown out all of the battle cries his youma made while sparring with 
one another. They held very little back to increase their skills... and 
for the sheer pleasure.

The room also echoed with moans of the suffering and screams of the 
excruciatingly tormented... sounds that were far sweeter to Khairephon&#39;s 
ears than any music in existence. Humans died so very easily... and 
hardly any of them had the courage to face their pain and death with any 
dignity. Just look at them, all chained to the wall and begging for 
mercy. Didn&#146;t they know that there would be no mercy? All they lived for 
now was for the sadistic amusement of Khairephon and his allies; the 
humans should accept their pain, embrace it! For only in the sweet 
ecstasy of agony, can one truly feel alive. But instead they whimpered 
and cowered from each blow to their soft bodies, from each snap of their 
fragile bones. The puny fools.

Khairephon had ordered his youma to gather human cattle from areas in 
the city that the feeble beings would not be missed from. His youma 
needed food and entertainment, after all. Thrinakie&#39;s youma had come in 
handy finding the right areas; they were always the brainy ones. 
However, Khairephon had never realised humans were so... weak. They were 
dying by the dozen each day, not including those used as food. He was 
certain he could clean out the city&#39;s entire population single-handedly 
in less than a week if he were so inclined. But instead he waited, 
allowing his cronies to abduct humans and return quietly to the 
nightclub via the sewer system that connected to this very room.

A metal cover on the floor was knocked on twice, once, then three times, 
signalling that the latest raiders had returned. As the youma clambered 
through the trapdoor and into the room from below, all carrying their 
unconscious prizes, Khairephon realised that one of their number was 
missing.

&quot;What happened to Vethuzial?&quot; he demanded of the closest raider as the 
creature dumped two human males with disregard onto the hard stone 
floor, who were both promptly dragged off to join the others of their 
kind.

The youma raider shrugged and looked to his companions, who all did the 
same or shook their heads... if they possessed one. Khairephon frowned 
angrily. The absent youma had better not be a deserter. He really hated 
having to hunt them down and punish them for being so cowardly.

Khairephon put his hands behind his head and leaned back in his chair, 
dispelling the thoughts of a deserter out of his mind. He let out a puff 
of air. Did he ever wish for some strong adversary to occupy his time 
with.

To be continued....


Author&#39;s ramblings:

There is chapter five. I changed Rei&#39;s outfit because I wanted to keep 
her identity secret when she transformed and fought. It will be more... 
interesting later on that way. Merely adding a mask to the outfit 
wouldn&#39;t have done the job. As a visual aid for the outfit, think Kaho 
Mizuki on Tokyo tower in Sakura&#39;s dream from Card Captor Sakura. If you 
haven&#39;t seen CCS... well, use your imagination. ^_^

I hope I described the fight scene okay, and wrote the ofuda thing 
correctly. I know I said I wouldn&#39;t mix much Japanese and English but... 
it just happened.

I didn&#39;t have the chance to introduce a good guy support character in 
this chapter. Don&#39;t worry; it&#39;s not some hero with powers from another 
dimension or something. It&#146;s just your average civilian, with no powers 
whatsoever. I just want someone to interact with Rei who doesn&#39;t want to 
kill her.

ofuda = a ward in the form of a strip of paper with Japanese characters 
written on it that Rei, being a miko, uses against evil spirits and 
demons. They usually just paralyse the paranormal being.</pre>
