the anime. 

============================================

  	Rei walked into the nursery room. It was dark outside and the 
same  with nursery room. By the windowsill sat Neo-Queen Serenity 
cradling her  baby, Chibi-usa, in her arms. Queen Serenity hummed 
sweetly to her  child. Rei stood there and leaned against the 
doorframe and took in the sight  of her queen. Serenity looked up and 
smiled at Rei acknowledging her presence  while continuing to hum to 
Chibi-usa. Chibi-usa was bundled in a soft blanket,  breathing calmly 
and clenching her mother&#39;s long finger in her chubby  little hand. It 
was truly such a sweet picture of a mother and her baby.  When 
Serenity was satisfied with putting her baby to sleep, she carefully 
got  up to put her baby in the cradle a few feet away from her.   
	Rei walked over to Queen Serenity who was standing by the 
cradle.  Serenity leaned over and whispered into Rei&#39;s ear, &quot;Let&#146;s go 
out to the  balcony we can talk there. And it&#39;s a warm night.&quot;
   	Rei nodded and Serenity took her hand and led her out to the  
balcony. It was a nice, warm night Rei thought in her mind. She 
silently  sighed as the moonlight naturally surrounded and played 
around  Serenity&#39;s form. Her long pigtails flowed all the way down to 
the floor and  her crown sparkled in night. Her bangs slightly blew 
across her forehead.  Serenity&#39;s eyes slow swept over her kingdom. 
Serenity drank in her city  below. The city lights looked like 
scattered jewels from Rei&#39;s and  Serenity&#39;s point of view from the 
balcony way up high.
   	Rei&#39;s quiet sigh was not missed by Serenity, &quot;So, was there  
anything you wanted to tell me, Rei?,&quot; Serenity watched as Rei&#39;s 
elegant ebony hair, shining with highlights of silver from the 
starlight, blow  gently around her.
    &quot;No, I just wanted to be in your accompany that&#39;s all,&quot; responding  
directly, she smiled at Serenity and laid her head on her folded arms 
resting on the railing.
    &quot;We haven&#39;t much time just to relax and spend some solitude with 
our  friends and family in awhile.&quot;
    &quot;Yes and no, I suppose,&quot; Rei answered paradoxically.
    Serenity taken aback, &quot;What do you mean, Rei?&quot;
    &quot;Hmmm..nothing important,&quot; not really saying that she had not 
spent time  alone with Serenity, just the 2 of them together. Changing 
the subject quickly, &quot;Everything turned out just as it should,  right 
Usagi?&quot; Rei used Serenity&#146;s name from the late 1900s.
    &quot;Not everything Rei, not everything,&quot; it was Serenity&#39;s turn to be  
mysterious.
   	Rei surprised, jerked her head up and looked directly at 
Serenity,  &quot;But I don&#39;t understand, Usagi. How could it not? You have 
fulfilled your  destiny as Setsuna for told. All of the Senshi are 
here with you. You married  your one true love and both you and King 
Endymoin rein over Crystal Tokyo.  Your daughter was recently born a 
few months ago,&quot; Rei turned to the railing  and put her arms on the 
railing, placing her cheek against her hand, &quot;It  turned out just as 
it should, Usagi. All the way you wanted to be,&quot; Rei replied though 
slightly sadly.
    &quot;You are almost right Rei but our chance to be together was 
realized too  late,&quot; Serenity turned towards Rei and touched the side 
of Rei&#39;s face with her cool hand.
   	Rei&#39;s cheeks blushed and warmed at Serenity&#39;s caress and 
statement  as her eyes widened in shock, &quot;How did you know? How did 
you find that I..,&quot;  she quickly looked away from Serenity and looked  
downward, &quot;Are you telling me that you have had similar feelings for 
me all this time?&quot;
    &quot;Yes, my dear Rei, but I didn&#39;t know you felt the same way till I 
fully  became a queen. The ginzuishou helped me find the answer why 
your love for me was so different from the rest of the Senshi,&quot; she  
then dropped her hand from Rei&#39;s face, &quot;If only we had known sooner. 
Rei, I wished you had told all those hundreds of years ago  instead of 
denying them to me and yourself.&quot;
    &quot;I..I.thought it was immoral of me to think of you that way or 
worse to  act upon them. I did not want to scare you away. I always 
treasured our friendship. So in the beginning, I just chased Mamoru as  
an excuse to hide my feelings and besides you were destined to be with 
Mamoru,&quot; Rei paused for a brief second, &quot;Don&#39;t you  love him?&quot;
    &quot;Yes, I do love him in my own way but my destiny with Mamoru was 
more  for a political necessity. You are the first one I fell in love 
with Rei, in the present and even when we were together for a short  
time back in the Silver Millennium.&quot;
    &quot;What? How could that be?&quot;
   	Both Serenity&#39;s crescent moon on her forehead and the Mars 
symbol  on Rei&#39;s forehead appeared and started to glow, &quot;I am queen 
now. The seal has served my mother&#39;s purpose. The fate of our souls is  
free in our hands now,&quot; Serenity royally decreed.
   	Rei felt a strange block like sensation in her forehead. The  
moment it was there and then slowly faded out of existence, &quot;Usagi..I 
remember....your mother..Queen Serenity had called for me at in her 
private  quarters at the Moon Palace. She had learned of our being 
together from Venus.  Queen Serenity was happy that her child had 
found love but she asked me to end it.  It would have brought slander 
if people found out that the High Moon Princess was  being courted by 
her Sailor Senshi. She was glad that I loved and cared for you deeply 
because I would look after your well being like  no other. I did my 
duty as your Sailor Senshi. Even further, Queen Serenity placed a 
magic binding on me to keep my feelings  for you in check that I never 
cross over the line. I still remember your tear-stained face and 
pleadings when I broke off our  relations.&quot;
   	Serenity continued on, &quot;Then much later after a broken heart, 
I  met Prince Endymion. At first, my mother was worried about the 
affair but eventually realized it to be actually advantageous for the  
Moon&#39;s royal house and Earth&#39;s to form a royal alliances through me 
and Prince Endymion being married. It has been far too long  to learn 
the truth, Rei,&quot; Serenity sadly looked at Rei with a smile.
    &quot;Forgive me, I never wanted to hurt you,&quot; Rei&#39;s eyes filled with 
tears.
    &quot;Don&#39;t be my dear. We both had duties and honors to keep,&quot; she 
embraced  Rei and wiped the tears from Rei&#39;s eyes with her thumb.
    &quot;Thank you, Usagi,&quot; she wrapped her arms around Serenity&#39;s waist, 
&quot;I  would never ask of you anything to break your marriage vows to 
King Endymion but you will always have my love.&quot;
    &quot;I know and you always had mine,&quot; Serenity nestled her head on 
Rei&#39;s  chest and pulled her closer against herself, &quot;Perhaps not fully 
in this small moment but we will be free to live and love as we  wish 
in the next lives I am sure.&quot;</pre>
