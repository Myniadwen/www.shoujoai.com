<h1>Birthday (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/birthday-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Hotaru Tenoh-Kaioh smiled just a bit nervously as the
black haired woman looked around the house, checking
to see if everything was all right. The Christmas tree
in the living room glittered with decorations, the
walls shone with garlands and the sweet scent of food
filled the air.

&quot;Would you calm down?&quot; Haruka Tenoh advised her
daughter gently, the taller sandy haired woman patting
the younger on the shoulder.

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Hotaru made herself stop her restless
movement, &quot;I just want to make sure that everything&#39;s
perfect.&quot;

&quot;It will be,&quot; Michiru Kaioh smiled from where she was
sitting on the couch, the green haired woman feeling
more than a bit amused to see her normally stoic
daughter looking so badly flustered. &#39;She reminds me
of Haruka on our first date,&#39; she mused.

Setsuna Meioh emerged from the kitchen, the greenish
black haired woman briskly wiping off her hands with a
towel. &quot;The dinner is on as per Miss Kino&#39;s
instructions,&quot; she reported to them calmly, &quot;it should
warm up fine.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for doing this,&quot; Hotaru smiled, &quot;but I
don&#39;t trust papa in the hitchen...&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Haruka protested as she settled down beside
Michiru.

&quot;...and Michiru-momma had to preform in the big
Christmas concert for charity earlier today,&quot; Hotaru
explained.

&quot;It was my pleasure,&quot; Setsuna answered, a slight smile
on her lips.

&#39;I guess it was,&#39; Hotaru thought as she hid a smile.

Going out to Makoto Kino&#39;s restaurant also gave
Setsuna the chance to go up the street at Luna&#39;s and
visit her own girlfriend, Ami Mizuno. A former medical
student fallen on hard times Ami had found a home in
Luna&#39;s, and brought to the place an aura of education
and grace the establishment usually lacked. At first
Setsuna had seized on any excuse to visit the lady,
though now they seemed to have settled into a
comfortable relationship.

&quot;Thank you for letting me invite Ami to our dinner, by
the way,&#39; Setsuna added as she addressed Haruka and
Michiru.

Michiru smiled, &quot;To be honest I&#39;m looking forward to
getting to know Ami better.&quot;

&quot;Try not to scare her off,&quot; Hotaru suggested.

&quot;We wouldn&#39;t do that,&quot; Haruka looked embarrassed.

Hotaru rolled her eyes, &quot;Tell that to my last
girlfriend.&quot;

Michiru sighed, &quot;That wasn&#39;t our fault... and you have
to admit she wasn&#39;t good for you.&quot;

&quot;At that point, I don&#39;t think I cared,&quot; Hotaru
admitted.

Haruka reached out to stroke Michiru&#39;s hand, &quot;I know
how that feels.&quot;

The doorbell rang before any more comments could come
and Setsuna rushed to get it. Following her usual wary
peer through the peephole she opened up the door and
smiled at their guests, &quot;Welcome Ami and Minako.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Minako Aino entered first, the blonde
carting a load of gifts.

&quot;Let me help you with that,&quot; Hotaru hurried over, soon
taking over about half the large pile of stuff. As
this was accomplished their hands brushed together
lingeringly and both of them exchanged shy smiles of
welcome.

&quot;I told her she didn&#39;t need to bring gifts,&quot; Ami
explained as she stripped off her large overcoat to
reveal a simple but sexy looking little black dress
that clung to her every curve, &quot;but Mina doesn&#39;t
usually listen.&quot;

&quot;For me,&quot; Setsuna said as she took Ami&#39;s coat, &quot;the
most wonderful gift is merely having you here with us
today.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad to be here with you, too.&quot; Ami blushed
charmingly and looked down, but it was obvious she was
pleased with the compliment.

&quot;Those two are so adorable,&quot; Minako softly whispered
to Hotaru as they piled up the presents under the
tree.

&quot;I know,&quot; Hotaru agreed, kneeling down to set a gift
and not incidently taking a look up Minako&#39;s legs
towards her skirt.

Minako noticed she was looking and winked, watching
Hotaru blush as she pulled her up. &quot;I think that&#39;s
cute too,&quot; Mina grinned.

&quot;No messing around before dinner,&quot; Haruka ordered,
looking amused as she gracefully rose to greet her two
guests.

&quot;Thank you for inviting me, Mrs Tenoh,&quot; Amu bowed just
a bit, well aware of Haruka&#39;s high station in life.

&quot;Just call me Haruka,&quot; she smiled charmingly as she
took Ami&#39;s hand.

&quot;The only Mrs Tenoh we know,&quot; Michiru added with some
amusement, &quot;is my mother in law.&quot;

&quot;Mother on law?&quot; Minako whispered to Hotaru.

&quot;Mean old bat,&quot; Hotaru whispered back to her, &quot;she
pretty much said that we&#39;d all be going to hell for
living like we do.&quot;

&quot;Ms Aino,&quot; Michiru moved forward to smile warmly at
the slim blonde and say, &quot;welcome to our home.&quot;

&quot;Minako, please,&quot; she laughed, &quot;or Mina if you want to
be friendly.&quot; She shook Michiru&#39;s hand, &quot;I saw your
concert on television, it was lovely.&quot;

Michiru smiled, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;Mina then,&quot; Haruka nodded agreeably, &quot;nice to see you
again.&quot; She looked amused, &quot;Hotaru&#39;s been visiting
Luna&#39;s quite a lot lately.&quot;

Hotaru blushed, &quot;You make me sound like a pervert.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not?&quot; Minako looked innocent.

Haruka snickered softly at that comment as Hotaru
rolled her eyes. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to like you,&quot; she
admitted.

&quot;I&#39;m SO glad,&quot; Minako winked as she took Hotaru&#39;s
hand.

Christmas dinner was a tradition on the Tenoh
household, one that Haruka had picked up traveling in
the west as a racer, and they went all out with it.
Turkey, stuffing potatoes and all were consumed,
toasts were made and conversation flowed easily.

&quot;So you&#39;ve been dating for nearly a year,&quot; Michiru
addressed Setsuna and Ami, &quot;when are you going to make
each other honest women?&quot;

Ami blushed charmingly while Setsuna buttered a roll
calmly. &quot;We&#39;re talking about it,&quot; Setsuna revealed,
&quot;these things take time.&quot;

Minako smiled at Hotaru, &quot;It has nearly been a year
for us too, hasn&#39;t it?&quot;

Hotaru chuckled softly, &quot;Yes, since my birthday gift
of a visit to Miss Luna&#39;s place.&quot;

&quot;Does that mean I was your present?&quot; MInako winked
impishly, &quot;Too bad you never unwrapped me completely.&quot;

&quot;Mina!&quot; Hotaru blushed.

Minako kissed her cheek gently, &quot;Well, this year
you&#39;ll be getting something special.&quot;

&quot;So, what do you think of her?&quot; Haruka whispered to
Michiru as they watched the young women talk.

&quot;I like her,&quot; Michiru admitted, &quot;she seems to really
care for Hotaru.&quot; A grin, &quot;And she doesn&#39;t let us
intimidate her, either.&quot;

Once dinner was over they socialized a bit, Minako
proving she could keep up with both couples while
staying close by Hotaru&#39;s side. Finally the two young
ladies slipped away, standing together out on the
balcony as they gazed out at the city.

&quot;You have a lovely family,&quot; Mina admitted as she
swirled her drink around in the glass.

Hotaru leaned against the railing, looking at Minako
fondly. Chuckling softly she added, &quot;I think they like
you, too.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Minako admitted, &quot;I&#39;ve been on my best
behavior.&quot;

&quot;No need,&quot; Hotaru stroked her arm, &quot;I think you&#39;re
wonderful.&quot;

&quot;Sweet talker,&quot; Minako leaned forward to kiss Hotaru
gently.

Hotaru reached into her pocket as she said, &quot;I have a
Christmas present for you.&quot;

Minako&#39;s eyes sparkled as she asked, &quot;Ooh, what is
it?&quot;

Hotaru popped open a small box, revealing a ring
glittering with diamonds, &quot;This.&quot;

Minako gasped at the ring, then looked up
questioningly at Hotaru. &quot;Does this mean what I think
it does?&quot; she asked softly.

Hotaru got down on one knee as she took Minako&#39;s hand
in hers as she softly asked, &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;

Minako smiled, a few tears glistening on her cheeks,
&quot;Yes, oh yes.&quot;</pre>
