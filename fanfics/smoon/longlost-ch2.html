Sailor Ice&#146;s P.O.V.

The Scouts still being weary of me thought it best to leave it be for 
next time. They left but not before Sailor Uranus gave me a glare that 
would scarce any normal person but not me. I was use to it by now, 
anyway before Sailor Cosmos left I asked her to stay for a moment. 
&#147;Serenity I do not trust that man&#133; Tuxedo Mask. Please for your own 
safety stay away from him?&#148; When I said this she was at first 
surprised but feeling that it was best nodded yes that she would stay 
away from Darien. When she turned to leave I did notice that Sailor 
Uranus was still close by the trees. Waiting for Sailor Cosmos. 
Knowing that she was in safe hands I too, turned to leave before they 
went to see if Crystal was still where their left her. When I got 
there I quietly let Crystal have control back but not with any 
memories from today. Making it look to her that she had just passed 
out from lack of energy. 

Normal P.O.V

Crystal&#146;s first thoughts were &#145;ok what just happened here why don&#146;t I 
remember anything&#146; getting up on shaky legs she saw the girls walking 
back. But what she saw between Amara and Serena did not go unnoticed. 
From what she could see of the girls it looked like they all caught 
it. And deep inside there was apart of Crystal that was happy that 
they where starting to remember their past together. But that was 
apart that Crystal did not know about yet. When they looked up they 
saw Crystal and the worry that was in her eyes, though she did not 
remember what happened after she past out she did remember that they 
had started to run in the direction that the attack was in. meeting 
half way three things came out of her mouth &#147;are you guys ok? What in 
the world did you think you where doing scaring me like that? And 
don&#146;t you EVER DO THAT AGAIN.&#148; Ending in a scream, the Sailors looked 
at her closely and noticed that like Sailor Ice her eyes where a dark 
brown almost black, and her eyes only seemed to get darker as she got 
angrier, as they got closer to her she did start to calm down as she 
saw that they were not hurt. To them she was your normal girl with 
short light brown hair with blond highlights. Serena and Amara being 
the closest to her where able to calm her down even more. &#147;Crystal 
please we are ok, please calm down.&#148;
