<h1>Moonlit Nights (part 3 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illus-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Hello again. ^-^ This story is kind of a third part to &#145;Moonlit 
Nights&#146; and it centers mainly around Diana and Momoko. 
Hopefully it will tie up some of the loose ends left from 
&#145;Moonlit Nights&#146; 1 and 2. You don&#146;t have to have read those 
before you read this, but it would probably help. 

For those of you that don&#146;t know some of these characters, 
here are some very brief descriptions (we&#146;re using some parts 
from the manga in this, too, like Ruruna and Naruru)-
Diana: She&#146;s ChibiUsa&#146;s guardian cat and comes from the 
future. She has a human form but she still has her tail as a 
human. 
Momoko: She&#146;s a cute lavender haired Chinese girl who 
befriended ChibiUsa shortly after she&#146;d first come to the past. 
Ruruna &amp; Naruru: They&#146;re two other friends of ChibiUsa&#146;s, 
though Hotaru can&#146;t seem to stand them. ^^ They only showed 
up once near the end of the manga, but they are fun to keep 
around. And yes they do say strange things like &#145;Haaging&#146;, so 
just remember we didn&#146;t make that up. ^_-

We&#146;d like to thank Eric because without him, we never would 
have been able to get this out for a long time. Thanks for 
everything, Eric. ^-^

We&#146;d love to hear what you think of this story and we&#146;d love 
to hear any ideas you all have for any other stories we could 
do. Please e-mail us.

Please enjoy the story. ^-^

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Over here, Momo-chan!&quot; a familiar voice yelled 
to Momoko. She smiled and looked up to see her 
friend ChibiUsa already waiting for her outside the 
gate with Ruruna and Naruru. Relief washed over her 
as she exited the school grounds and made her way 
over to her friends. ChibiUsa waved cheerfully to her 
as she approached.

&quot;I&#39;m glad that&#39;s finally over with,&quot; Momoko said
as she started walking along with the other girls.

&quot;Yeah. All those tests the week after the dance.&quot;
ChibiUsa sighed. &quot;I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t pass most of
them.&quot;

&quot;We shouldn&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Naruru said. &quot;Its
Friday, so we&#39;ve got all weekend to forget about
the week.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; Ruruna said. &quot;That gives me
time to talk to my boyfriend about not being able
to go anyplace last weekend because of the dance.
What are you two going to do?&quot;

&quot;Not much,&quot; Momoko said. She was glad that it was
the weekend, but she really didn&#39;t feel like doing
anything. It had been a week, but her mind kept
being drawn back to the mysterious girl she&#39;d met
at the dance. Every time she closed her eyes, she
saw her. When she fell asleep, she would dream of 
what had happened. And she could swear it felt like the
other girl was right at arms length at times.

&quot;Hotaru and I are going shopping and then we&#39;re
going to see a movie.&quot; ChibiUsa smiled.

Naruru and Ruruna stared at her for several moments.
&quot;You&#39;re the only one she acts that way around, you
know,&quot; Naruru said.

&quot;What way?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.

&quot;All happy and excited. Blushing a lot. Buying you
things,&quot; Ruruna said.

&quot;That&#39;s because I&#39;m always short on money,&quot; ChibiUsa
countered the only excuse she could think of.

&quot;How she gets so jealous over you, how she 
walks with you to school,&quot; Naruru continued.

&quot;Those weird looks she gives you,&quot; Ruruna and Naruru
said simultaneously.

ChibiUsa blushed a deep crimson hue. Momoko said
nothing, having seen ChibiUsa kiss the dark haired
girl in question already.

&quot;She&#39;s my best friend,&quot; ChibiUsa said defensively.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It seems kinda strange to me,&quot; Naruru
said. &quot;I heard a rumor that she&#39;s a lesbian. Could be
why she stays around you so much, ChibiUsa. She
probably likes you.&quot;

&quot;But that&#39;s a rumor,&quot; ChibiUsa protested.

&quot;Well, its not like you exactly discourage her, though.
So of course she wouldn&#39;t have stopped,&quot; Ruruna added.

&quot;It&#39;s just a rumor. You should ignore things like
that,&quot; ChibiUsa said. Two arms wrapped around her from
behind pulling her into a hug, startling the already
nervous pink haired girl.    

&quot;Hi, ChibiUsa-chan. Sorry I&#39;m late, but I forgot
something back in class,&quot; Hotaru said happily as she
let go of the other girl and held her hand. Ruruna and
Naruru stared at ChibiUsa as if they&#39;d proven their point.

ChibiUsa laughed nervously. &quot;Where to next, everyone?&quot;
she asked, trying to change the subject.

&quot;We&#39;re going back to Ruruna&#39;s house,&quot; Naruru answered.

&quot;Yeah, so we&#39;ll probably see you later. We&#39;ll probably
do some haaging before we get there though,&quot; Ruruna said 
as she waved to the other girls before she took off with
Naruru.

&quot;What does that mean again?&quot; Hotaru asked her pink haired
girlfriend.

&quot;It means they&#39;re going to get some Haagen Dazs before they
go home,&quot; ChibiUsa supplied.     

&quot;Ohhhh... I wish they&#39;d just talk like normal people,&quot;
Hotaru said exasperated. She&#39;d never liked the two girls
much, but they were ChibiUsa&#39;s friends, so she tried to at
least get along with them.

ChibiUsa laughed. &quot;They aren&#39;t that bad, Taru-chan.&quot; She put 
her  arms around the dark haired girl. Hotaru smiled as she felt  
ChibiUsa against her.

&quot;Maybe not, but I&#39;m still glad they&#39;re gone.&quot; Hotaru started
leaning towards ChibiUsa as the other girl began to do the
same. ChibiUsa stopped suddenly and slowly turned to stare
in a certain direction. Hotaru followed her gaze and saw
Momoko still standing there. The two girls pulled away and
looked around nervously as their friend pretended not to
have noticed anything.

&quot;So, where should we go now?&quot; ChibiUsa asked nervously.

Momoko decided to ignore what had just happened for the 
time being. She had to much on her mind to worry about her 
friend&#39;s relationship. She still didn&#39;t know what to say to 
ChibiUsa about it in the first place. And it really didn&#39;t seem 
like much of a big deal anymore. Not after she&#39;d started 
realizing how she felt about Diana. She sighed before forcing 
a smile. &quot;How about the Crown Fruit Parlor? We can go there 
before we decide what to do next.&quot;

ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes lit up while Hotaru sweat dropped, knowing
she&#39;d probably be paying for a large meal for the pink haired
girl.

&quot;Sounds great!&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.

&quot;Ok then. We&#39;ll find out what else we want to do once we get
there,&quot; Momoko said. She was glad was glad that they were
going to the Fruit Parlor. ChibiUsa would be distracted by the
food while Hotaru was distracted by ChibiUsa, as she often 
was. It would give Momoko more time to think about things.

As the three girls continued walking, a gray kitten ran up to
them.

&quot;Diana!&quot;

Momoko&#39;s head jerked up as she heard that familiar name. She
quickly looked around for the beautiful girl. Her spirits sank 
as she realized it was ChibiUsa&#39;s kitten.

ChibiUsa picked up the kitten and placed it on her head, as
she often did. &quot;Do you want to go with us?&quot; she asked.

Diana meowed in response. ChibiUsa giggled as the kitten 
tried to get more comfortable on her head. Momoko and 
Hotaru stared at ChibiUsa for a moment, the other girl 
seeming to find nothing strange about the kitten riding on her 
head.

Diana kept shyly stealing glances at Momoko as they began to
walk again. She&#39;d been meeting ChibiUsa everyday after 
school that week so she could see her lavender haired friend. 
After learning that the other girl liked her, she tried to see
her as often as possible. Diana had a crush on Momoko for
a long time and it felt so good to know the other girl liked her.  
Unfortunately, she hadn&#39;t been able to tell Momoko how she 
felt.


Momoko sat quietly in thought while petting the gray kitten
curled up in her lap. She barely noticed the other two girls
talking to her. She was having trouble concentrating because 
her thoughts kept returning to the mysterious girl at the dance. 
She finally brought her attention back to Hotaru and ChibiUsa 
when she noticed them stand up.

&quot;We&#39;re sorry, Momo-chan,&quot; Hotaru apologized. &quot;We promised 
Setsuna-mama and Michiru-mama that we&#39;d go shopping with 
them today. We&#39;re going to be late if we don&#39;t get going soon. 
I can&#39;t believe I forgot.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it,&quot; Momoko said, feeling a bit relieved 
that she&#39;d have time to think by herself.

&quot;You could come with us if you want,&quot; Hotaru offered 
hopefully.

&quot;No. Thanks anyway, but right now I don&#39;t really feel like 
going anywhere,&quot; Momoko declined.

&quot;Okay. Call me tonight then,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

&quot;ChibiUsa...&quot; Hotaru began.

&quot;Oh yeah. Never mind. Call Hotaru&#39;s house tonight. I&#39;ll be 
there.&quot; ChibiUsa smiled at her friend as she stood up. 
ChibiUsa and Hotaru waved to her as they walked off.

Momoko sighed. She saw them hold hands as soon as they 
thought they were out of sight. &#39;I was so shocked when I found 
out that they were together. But now... I don&#39;t know. Am I 
jealous of them?&#39; She sighed again and took a sip of her drink. 
&#39;At least they have each other. I just want to see Diana again.&#39; 
She blushed deeply as she thought of  the other girl. &#39;How 
could I be in love with her? I only met her the night of the 
dance. Then why do I feel like I&#39;ve known her for years?
She seemed so familiar.&#39;

Momoko gently pet the sleeping kitten on her lap. Diana 
purred happily. &quot;Oh! ChibiUsa forgot to take Diana with her.&quot; 
She picked Diana up and quickly went out the door, trying to 
catch up to her friends. She looked around as crowds of people 
passed by on the busy streets obscuring her view. &quot;She said 
she&#39;d be at Hotaru&#39;s house tonight. I guess you can stay with 
me until then.&quot; She lifted the kitten up to her face. 
&quot;How does that sound?&quot;

Diana meowed happily and licked Momoko&#39;s cheek. The 
lavender haired girl giggled. &quot;Okay then. I could use some 
company right now anyway.&quot;
The kitten looked back at her happily, purring. Momoko 
walked away from the cafe with the kitten in her arms and no 
real destination in mind.

&quot;Where should we go Diana?&quot; Momoko asked.

&#39;She&#39;s asking me? I have to come up with a nice place for us to 
go then. Just don&#39;t say anything stupid,&#39; Diana thought to 
herself. &quot;We could...&quot;

Before Diana could finish, Momoko turned around swiftly. 
She looked around to see who the voice belonged to. &quot;Hello?&quot;

Diana sweatdropped. &quot;Oh no,&#39; she thought. &#39;I&#39;m a cat. I&#39;m not
supposed to talk. Good going.&#39; Diana meowed nervously, 
hoping Momoko would forget about the voice.

&quot;That was strange.&quot; Momoko shrugged and continued 
walking. &quot;Can&#39;t think of anything, can you? Let&#39;s go home 
then. I&#39;ll take you to ChibiUsa later tonight.&quot; Momoko smiled 
as she heard Diana meow in agreement.

&#39;Why am I talking to a cat so much? Probably because I hear 
ChibiUsa talk to her so much. And its comforting in an odd 
way. I don&#39;t have to worry about what I say to her. And its 
nice to have someone to talk to about Diana.&#39; Momoko 
scratched the kitten&#39;s chin and started off for home.


Momoko unlocked the door to her house and let herself in. 
She knew her parents were both gone for the night and that 
was fine with her. She&#39;d rather be alone for the moment. Her 
mother had noticed her strange behavior lately and had asked 
her about it. She had tried to tell her mother it was nothing, but 
she didn&#39;t believe her.

Momoko sighed wearily as she walked into her room, setting 
down her backpack before sitting on the bed.  &quot;Why is this 
getting to me so much? I&#39;ve never felt like this before,&quot; she 
said aloud. She slumped backwards onto the bed staring at the 
ceiling.    

The little gray cat crawled onto the lavender haired girl&#39;s 
lap. Momoko giggled. &quot;Thanks, kitty. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here.&quot; 
Diana purred as Momoko began petting her. &quot;Why&#39;d Diana 
have to leave?&quot; she asked, not expecting an answer.

&#39;Because you noticed my tail,&#39; Diana thought sadly.

&quot;I still don&#39;t know what was going on. That whole night was 
pretty strange,&quot; Momoko closed her eyes, trying to remember 
every small detail of the night of the dance. How pretty Diana 
had been. How it felt when they were dancing. How she&#39;d 
forgotten her whole reason for being there while dancing with 
the other girl.

Diana silently watched the lavender haired girl as she lay deep 
in thought. Her eyes darted over Momoko&#39;s lovely features. 
Diana blushed as she continued looking at the other girl. She 
stood up on Momoko&#39;s lap and walked across the other girl so 
that her face was right above Momoko&#39;s. Her paw gently 
stroked Momoko&#39;s cheek. The lavender haired girl didn&#39;t seem 
to notice. Diana sighed longingly. Without thinking, she 
leaned forward and tried to kiss Momoko.

Momoko&#39;s eyes opened suddenly. Diana jumped back. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry!&quot; Diana blurted out.

Momoko stared wide eyed at the kitten. Diana stared back at 
her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she repeated. Momoko abruptly fainted.   

Momoko blinked several times. What had happened? Dim 
light filtered through her open window, making her wince. 
She&#39;d been unconscious for a while.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she heard a voice ask worriedly. She could 
barely make out the figure sitting near her on her bed. She 
blinked again, trying to make out who it was. She bolted 
upright when she saw it was the girl she&#39;d met a week ago, 
Diana.

&quot;Diana!? What are you doing here?&quot; Momoko asked, shock 
and joy mixed in her voice.

Diana thought for a moment before answering. &quot;Well, its kind 
of hard to explain.&quot; Diana remembered how she&#39;d left the 
dance after Momoko had noticed her tail. She tried desperately 
to keep it behind her to hide it from view. &#39;Why do I have to 
keep my tail in my human form? Mom and Dad don&#39;t have 
tails when they&#39;re humans. It&#39;s not fair. Especially with 
Momoko. How am I supposed to explain it to her?&#39; she 
thought.

&quot;I&#39;m.. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re here,&quot; Momoko said shyly. &#39;Why am I so
nervous right now? This isn&#39;t like me at all.&#39;

&#39;Is she blushing?&#39; Diana asked herself. &#39;Could it be because of
me?&#39; she thought happily. &#39;Now&#39;s my chance to tell her how 
I&#39;ve felt about her for so long. She said she... she said she 
loved me when she was talking to my kitten form. But what if 
she knows that the kitten and the girl are both me. Would she 
still have said that about my human form? I&#39;m so nervous. I 
don&#39;t know what to say. How can I explain things to her? 
What would she think?&#39;

&#39;She&#39;s here. I don&#39;t know how, but she&#39;s here,&#39; Momoko 
thought. &#39;That&#39;s what I&#39;ve been wanting all week, to see her 
again. So why can&#39;t I think of anything to say to her?&#39;

Both girls sat nervously, unsure of what to do.

Momoko suddenly turned to Diana. &quot;Why did you leave the 
dance? I&#39;ve felt bad about that for the past week.&quot;

Diana looked away from the other girl. &quot;I just had to leave...&quot;

&quot;Diana, I&#39;ve been so confused about things for the past week. I
just found out something surprising about some friends of 
mine that I&#39;m still trying to deal with, and all these things 
about you and the dance. I don&#39;t know if I can handle anymore 
secrets or lies. Please, can we tell each other the truth about 
everything?&quot; Momoko pleaded.

Diana wanted to agree with her, but there were so many things 
she didn&#39;t know how to explain. &quot;Things are a lot more 
confusing than you think.&quot;

Momoko shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t care. I want to know.&quot;

Diana sighed. There were so many things she wanted to tell 
Momoko. And Momoko did want to know. It seemed to fit 
perfectly. Diana took a deep breath before replying. &quot;Okay, 
but this is all pretty strange. You have to promise that you&#39;ll 
believe me.&quot;

Momoko stared at her for a moment. &#39;What could be so 
strange?&#39; she thought. &quot;Okay, I promise.&quot;

Diana smiled nervously. &quot;Good. Well, I should probably start 
at the beginning. You should make yourself comfortable. Its a 
long story.&quot;

Momoko looked on, interested in what the other girl had to 
say. Diana started by trying to explain where she came from. 
Momoko looked on in disbelief as Diana told her about her 
home in the future. She went on to tell how she came back to 
the past as ChibiUsa&#39;s guardian and how she&#39;d met Momoko 
because she was ChibiUsa&#39;s friend. Diana continued on, trying 
to explain most of what had happened up to that point.

Momoko sat silently for a moment, completely unsure of what 
to say. &quot;But how could you have known me for so long? I 
didn&#39;t meet you till last week,&quot; she finally said, not mentioning 
the stranger parts of Diana&#39;s story. She wanted to believe 
Diana, but what she said couldn&#39;t be real.

&quot;Well, that&#39;s not exactly true. You&#39;ve met me, you just didn&#39;t
recognize me,&quot; Diana explained.

&quot;Trust me. I&#39;d recognize you anywhere,&quot; Momoko reassured 
her.

&quot;I didn&#39;t really look the same, though,&quot; Diana said nervously.
Momoko stared at Diana oddly. Diana sighed. &quot;I know this is 
all hard to believe. I shouldn&#39;t have said anything. Its just that I 
really wanted to tell you. I wanted you to know. I didn&#39;t want 
to hide anything from you, Momo-chan.&quot; She looked down 
sadly.

Momoko didn&#39;t know what to do. Diana was disappointed that 
she didn&#39;t believe her. But it all sounded so unbelievable. She 
wanted to say something comforting to the other girl, but she 
couldn&#39;t think of anything.

Suddenly Diana looked up at the lavender haired girl. &quot;Wait! I 
can prove it. If this is possible, then the rest is. Then you&#39;ll 
believe me,&quot; she said happily.

Momoko sweatdropped at Diana&#39;s enthusiasm. &quot;That&#39;s good...&quot; 
She had no idea what Diana could mean. She didn&#39;t think 
anything could prove Diana&#39;s bizarre story. Diana hesitated for 
a moment. It had ended her night with Momoko at the dance 
and now she was hoping it would prove she was telling the
truth. She sat up on her knees and turned to the side slightly to
show her tail. &quot;See? I&#39;m a Sailorchibimoon&#39;s guardian cat. I 
offer advice and help when I can.&quot;

Momoko looked at Diana&#39;s tail for a moment. She reached out 
and grabbed it to see if it was real. She instantly let go when 
the tail moved in her hand. &quot;A tail?&quot; Momoko continued to 
watch as Diana moved it behind her.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Diana said quietly, a little embarrassed about 
Momoko&#39;s reaction to it. &quot;I&#39;m the only one that keeps my tail 
in human form. My mom and dad don&#39;t have theirs when 
they&#39;re humans.&quot;

&quot;Human form?&quot; Momoko asked, still shocked by the other 
girl&#39;s tail. It felt so real, like when she&#39;d been petting the kitten 
earlier. This was all too confusing. None of this was making 
any sense. Momoko paced back and forth for a second in a 
vain attempt to say something, anything, in the midst of all 
this. &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; she asked as she turned around. The 
other girl was gone. In her place was ChibiUsa&#39;s kitten, sitting 
exactly where Diana had been a moment ago.

&quot;Hi!&quot; The kitten said, smiling up at Momoko.

Momoko took a step back. This was really starting to freak her 
out. &quot;You talked,&quot; she barely managed to say.

&quot;Of course I did,&quot; the kitten said teasingly. &quot;This is what I was
talking about. This is my cat form.&quot;

&quot;Diana?&quot; Momoko knew that the girl she&#39;d met and ChibiUsa&#39;s 
kitten were both named Diana, but she hadn&#39;t realized the 
significance of that till now. &quot;You&#39;re her?&quot;

The kitten nodded. &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s my human form.&quot; She stuck 
out her tongue. &quot;I told you. And I am from the future.&quot;

Momoko blinked a couple times. She felt faint. This just 
wasn&#39;t possible. Cats didn&#39;t talk. And girls didn&#39;t have tails or 
change into cats. Then again, she had been attacked by a 
lemure who was after her dream mirror a couple years back. 
She&#39;d been saved by Sailormoon and Sailorchibimoon. So 
strange things had happened to her before. This wasn&#39;t too 
much stranger, was it?

&quot;Momo-chan?&quot; Diana asked, still in her kitten form. &quot;Are you 
okay?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m fine,&quot; Momoko said. She sat down on the bed by 
Diana. Momoko and the kitten sat in uneasy silence for a 
moment. As Momoko thought about what this meant if Diana 
was ChibiUsa&#39;s kitten, a sudden realization donned on her. 
&quot;Diana, if you&#39;re the kitten I&#39;ve been talking to, then you were 
here in my room the night of the dance, right?&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Diana said reluctantly.

&quot;Then you heard what I said about your human form?&quot; 
Momoko said nervously.

Diana didn&#39;t say anything for a moment. &quot;Yes,&quot; she said 
quietly. Momoko blushed deeply and looked away. A hand on 
her arm turned her around to face Diana, now as a human. 
&quot;You don&#39;t know how much it meant to me when I heard you 
say how you felt about me. I&#39;ve been in love with you for so 
long, but I never said anything because you only thought I was 
a kitten. That night, dancing with you, talking, hearing you say 
you loved me, was the best night of my life.&quot; Diana smiled 
brightly, her eyes misting up with tears. Momoko looked on in 
alarm. &quot;I&#39;ll always remember that night. But you didn&#39;t know 
who I really was. That wasn&#39;t fair of me. Arigato, Momo-
chan.&quot; Diana stood up and wiped some tears from her eyes
before turning to leave.

Momoko got in front of Diana before she could reach the 
door. &quot;Diana, wait.&quot; She put her hands on the other girls 
shoulders and looked deep into her eyes. &quot;What I said that 
night, I meant all of it. You&#39;re right, I didn&#39;t know that the 
kitten I was telling it to and the girl I was talking about were 
the same person, but that doesn&#39;t matter. It doesn&#39;t change 
anything. I meant every word of it, Diana. I love you.&quot; Diana&#39;s 
mouth opened slightly, but nothing came out. She couldn&#39;t 
think of anything to say. She didn&#39;t have to. Momoko pulled 
Diana closer and kissed her. Diana gasped as she felt the 
lavender haired girl&#39;s lips pressed against her own. Momoko&#39;s 
eyes closed as she felt Diana kissing her back. Both girls
were nervous about what lay ahead, but they felt safe in each 
others&#39; arms and that was all that mattered.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChibiUsa and Hotaru plopped back down on the soft bed in 
Hotaru&#39;s room. ChibiUsa had bought a beautiful new dress and 
hair bows for herself. She&#39;d even bought a new ribbon for her 
kitten. It was purple with two cute bells for Diana. Then the 
realization hit her like a tidal wave. She bolted up off the
bed and stared at Hotaru with wide eyes.

&quot;What is it ChibiUsa?&quot; she asked worried that something was 
wrong.

&quot;Diana! I forgot Diana at the Crown with Momoko!&quot; she 
yelled with a hushed harsh tone. She jumped up to run to the 
door and was stopped by Hotaru&#39;s hand.

&quot;It&#39;s been three hours Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru whispered, &quot;Do 
you really think that Momoko and Diana are at the Crown at 
this time?&quot;

&quot;No but I can go to Momoko&#39;s. I&#39;m sure Momoko wouldn&#39;t let 
her stay at the Crown by herself!&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; They would have continued the little conversation if 
Michiru hadn&#39;t knocked on the door just then.

&quot;ChibiUsa there&#39;s a girl at the door wanting to speak to you. 
She&#39;s seems very distraught.&quot; ChibiUsa stared at the elder 
senshi and then she looked at Hotaru. They both bolted for the 
door and dashed down the stairs in record time. They where 
greeted by the vision of Momoko holding Diana in her hands 
they both turned to each other and then they to Momoko.

&quot;Small Lady who is this girl?&quot; Haruka asked clasping her arm 
around Michiru&#39;s waist. She pulled Michiru closer and looked 
at Hotaru and ChibiUsa with a parental glare. 

&quot;My name is Momoko, and I am ChibiUsa and Hotaru&#39;s 
school friend. I do know how late it is but you see they forgot 
Diana and I wanted to give her back. I also wanted to talk to 
them very briefly.&quot; Haruka nodded her approval but didn&#39;t
let ChibiUsa and Hotaru know that they where off the hook. 
She ushered Michiru into the next room leaving the girls 
alone.

&quot;Thank you for caring for Diana for me Momo-chan,&quot; 
ChibiUsa said reaching for Diana. She was surprised when the 
kitten didn&#39;t jump into her arms. Instead the kitten remained 
with the lavender haired girl purring contently. She looked
to ChibiUsa and said with a very serious glaze.

&quot;She already knows about me Small Lady.&quot;

&quot;Diana!&quot; Hotaru exclaimed clasping a hand around her mouth. 
Momoko only smiled and nodded.

&quot;Yes I know all about you Sailorchibimoon, Sailorsaturn.&quot; 
Momoko said, &quot;It was a very long story but it was worth it. I 
can understand why you&#39;ve kept it a secret. I&#146;m just 
disappointed that you couldn&#39;t tell me a little sooner.&quot;

&quot;But...but why Diana?&quot; ChibiUsa stammered, &quot;Do you know 
how much trouble you&#39;ve just gotten us into? What danger 
you&#39;ve put us in?&quot;

&quot;What danger?&quot; Momoko asked, &quot;I should of known, besides 
it shouldn&#39;t of been Diana that told me this. It should have 
been you and Hotaru. Why didn&#39;t you tell me you two were in 
love?&quot; Hotaru took a step back and sat down in the couch.

&quot;That&#39;s what bugs you the most?&quot; she asked, &quot;That Odango-
chan and I didn&#39;t tell you we where in love? Not that we 
were....&quot;     

&quot;Were what?&quot; Momoko asked, &quot;Sailor Senshi? No, that secret 
I understand. The being in love one I don&#39;t. I have been your 
friend for years now, ChibiUsa. You should have trusted me. 
Besides Diana and I have our own little secret we&#39;d like to tell 
you.&quot;       

&quot;Secret?&quot; ChibiUsa asked looking to Momoko and Diana. 
Searching their faces for the answer and coming up with 
nothing. She sat next to Hotaru and took her hand
into her own.

&quot;You tell them, Diana.&quot; Momoko said watching Diana leap off 
of her head and patter down to the floor. Then she saw Diana 
change into her human form, take her hand into her own and 
smile to ChibiUsa and Hotaru.

&quot;We&#39;re an item!&quot; she said with childish glee. Her face lighting 
up into a thousand little bulbs. The two girls sat in amazement, 
the whole ordeal not really registering.

&quot;Momo-chan,&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice interrupted. &quot;Would you like to 
stay with us tonight?&quot; Hotaru looked to her parents in the 
doorway. The green-haired women and her blonde haired 
lover looking at the two couples, smiling happily.

&quot;Here, Haruka-papa, Michiru-mama?&quot; Hotaru asked. &quot;But...&quot;

&quot;You have a true friend here Hotaru.&quot; Michiru said in her sing-
song voice. &quot;It isn&#39;t everyday you find someone in the same 
situation that you are both in. Or that understands the two of 
you so well. You have both found someone who is accepting 
you for who you are. For who you&#39;ve become, it&#39;s a special 
gift. You should embrace it.&quot; Hotaru looked to ChibiUsa
and felt a great weight lifted off of her. The dream of her not 
having to hide the fact that she was in love with ChibiUsa was 
coming true. She didn&#39;t have to hide in her own home, and 
now she didn&#39;t have to hide it from Diana and Momoko. She 
smiled with a beam and took ChibiUsa&#39;s hand into her own.

&quot;Your right Michiru-mama,&quot; Hotaru said, kissing ChibiUsa in 
the forehead. &quot;I am lucky.&quot;

**********

ChibiUsa and Hotaru sat along side each other while looking 
at Diana and Momoko holding hands and talking feverishly 
about the events that had brought them together. The story 
unfolding in a strange and happy conversation. They were
still adjusting to the fact that they where free to be themselves 
amongst the two girls that had been their dear friends for so 
long. The feeling was soaring, but the change was also filled 
with surprises. ChibiUsa was met with more kisses then she 
could handle, and she was able to lay into Hotaru&#39;s embrace
for longer periods of time then she was used to. The smiles on 
Diana and Momoko&#39;s faces, both pleased and happy, gave her 
an easy feeling.

&#39;If I had known how different our relationship would after 
telling just a few people,&#39; ChibiUsa thought, &#39;I would have 
done it a long time ago.&#39;  Hotaru smiled and kissed her again.
