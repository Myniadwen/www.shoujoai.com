<h1>Crystal Tokyo, California (part 4 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cali-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Hotaru gently stroked at Usagi&#39;s long blonde hair, holding the younger 
woman close to her in her arms. The light outside the window had 
dimmed somewhat, and she could hear that things were starting to 
settle down a bit in the tavern just below them. Usagi woke up from 
her doze, her bright blue eyes opening up to meet Hotaru&#39;s own.

&quot;What time is it?&quot; Usagi asked, stretching out on the bed. She hid a 
smile, watching Hotaru looking at her nearly bare body as she 
stretched.

A faint blush marked Hotaru&#39;s cheeks, made even more vivid by her 
usual paleness. &quot;It&#39;s nearly nine, I think,&quot; she answered her, smiling 
over at Usagi.

Usagi suddenly sat up, looking rather alarmed. &quot;Do you think we missed 
diner?&quot; she asked Hotaru anxiously, a few tears in her eyes.

The darker haired girl sweatdropped. &quot;I didn&#39;t hear Makoto ringing the 
meal bell,&quot; Hotaru said with a smile, &quot;we should still be fine.&quot;

Usagi bounced to her feet, grabbing up her clothes from the pile 
resting on the floor. She dressed as quickly as she could manage, 
Hotaru watching her with a amused expression on her face. She got up 
off the bed herself, pulling her simple little black dress back on, 
and then tidying her hair with a simple flip of her hand.

&#39;Short dark hair really does come in handy sometimes,&#39; she thought 
with a little smile on her face. Hotaru noticed that Usagi was having 
some problems with her own hair, so she stepped up behind her to 
lovingly help her untangle the long blond tails.



&quot;I think we&#39;ll just have to give up on eating any of our lunch,&quot; 
Michiru said, sounding rather amused by the situation.

Michiru poked through the big picnic basket, looking around for 
anything that was still even somewhat warm for them to eat. She hadn&#39;t 
gotten dressed yet, just wrapped Haruka&#39;s shirt around her shoulders, 
and Haruka thought that she looked quite charming in only a white 
cotton shirt.

Haruka sat up on the blanket, only her blue eyes showing her 
amusement. &quot;We should probably be getting back, anyway,&quot; she said with 
a little smile.

Michiru looked over at the slim young woman, her sandy blonde hair 
messy, a flush to her cheeks, and wondered why she had once been 
afraid of her. She nodded her agreement, looking up at the darkening 
skies, &quot;We can make it back for dinner, I think.&quot;

The two dressed quickly, occasionally sneaking little kisses as the 
did so. The picnic was packed up, and they were reluctantly ready to 
go. Walking over to the patiently waiting horse, Haruka reached over 
to gently stroke along Michiru&#39;s cheek.

Haruka took a deep, steadying breath, then she asked Michiru softly, 
&quot;I&#39;d like to do this again, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Michiru bent into the caress, and if she was a cat she would have been 
purring aloud. &quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Michiru said with a happy smile. Haruka 
held her close as the rode to town, her arms circled firmly around her 
curves, occasionally sneaking a naughty caress.

&quot;If you keep that up,&quot; Michiru said to her rather breathlessly, after 
a very naughty touch &quot;I think I&#39;m going to fall right off this poor 
horse!&quot;

Haruka gave her a smoky little laugh, but her hands stilled their 
restless touches, at least for now. &quot;We can&#39;t have that,&quot; she said in 
a sexy whisper into Michiru&#39;s ear, &quot;it would spoil all my evil plans 
for you tonight.&quot;

Michiru laughed softly as they reached the Palace. &quot;Your room or 
mine?&quot; she asked Haruka archly as the other woman helped her down. She 
could get down herself, but it felt so nice having that firm grip 
around her waist.

&quot;If we wear out one bed, then we&#39;ll just move on to the other,&quot; Haruka 
said with a cheeky grin on her face. Michiru batted her arm, blushing 
brightly, and Haruka laughed. They stabled the horse and walked in 
together.

There was a moment of near silence when they walked in, then the 
conversations started up again. The crowds had begun to thin out for 
the evening, but the servers were still kept busy. A pretty new girl 
with green hair was flirting from table to table, taking their orders 
and then delivering the plates full of steaming food.

Strangely, there was a odd giggling going on as Haruka and Michiru 
passed through the crowds to the stairway where Setsuna was standing. 
She watched them get nearer with thinly veiled amusement, stopping the 
two of them once they reached her.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Haruka asked, a bit worried.

A smile teased at Setsuna&#39;s lips. &quot;You&#39;re buttoned up wrong,&quot; she 
explained to Haruka softly, pointing at the front of her shirt.

Haruka looked down, blushing a bit. Obviously, she had gotten dressed 
a little too fast. She looked at herself, then at Michiru, and 
realized that it was very likely obvious what they had been doing, at 
least by the state of their clothes.

&quot;Congratulations,&quot; Setsuna said with a little grin. &quot;Go get changed,&quot; 
she advised them, &quot;you&#39;ve got leaves on your clothes, too.&quot;

Haruka and Michiru went upstairs with as much dignity as they could 
manage, holding hands to the loud cheers of the crowd.



Emerald deposited the pile of plates on the table, then she carefully 
placed the dishes in front of each customer. She turned to head back 
to the kitchen, when she saw Haruka and Michiru walk in together. She 
noticed the way they stood close, holding each other&#39;s hands, and 
realized they were almost certainly a couple.

&#39;This could make things a bit more difficult,&#39; she mused, then she 
continued on into the Palace&#39;s bustling kitchen.

Makoto was standing at the stove, handling several different cooking 
pots and pans at once. She juggled various seasonings, ordered her 
assistants around, and continued to produce wonderful meals. The 
smells alone were terrific, not to mention the tastes!

&quot;That&#39;s incredible,&quot; Emerald said softly, looking around her in awe.

&quot;Thanks, Emi,&quot; Makoto said distractedly. The last few orders were 
brought in, but Makoto kept concentrating on her cooking, a few pans 
and pots left out.

&quot;Why are you still cooking?&quot; she asked her curiously. Emerald would 
have thought that the taller woman would have wanted a break by now.

Makoto looked a bit little surprised, then she laughed kindly. &quot;I 
forgot you just arrived, Emi,&quot; she said with a warm smile, &quot;I also 
make the dinner for all of the people who work here in the Palace, 
including you.&quot;

Emerald smiled back, and bowed to her deeply. &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; 
she said with real sincerity. After smelling Makoto&#39;s cooking, she 
really wanted to try some!

Minako stuck her head in the door, reporting to Makoto &quot;Ami&#39;s back 
from helping Priss give birth.&quot; She smiled, &quot;Sylia was a bit worried, 
but the baby&#39;s just fine. They were going to name the poor kid after 
Ami, but she talked them out of it.&quot;

Emerald smiled and raised her eyebrows at that. &quot;Does that happen very 
often, then?&quot; she asked the two of them curiously.

Makoto laughed softly. &quot;More than a few times,&quot; she admitted with a 
grin, &quot;until Ami got tired and put her foot down about it.&quot;

&quot;I was just imagining a whole generation of little girls and boys all 
named after poor Ami,&quot; Minako chuckled, an odd look on her face. 
Everyone shared a soft laugh, then Emerald headed out into the tavern 
to help with the last of the clean up.

&#39;Gee, they&#39;re all such nice people,&#39; she thought, carefully wiping a 
table down. She stopped for a moment, then ahe went back to work with 
a fierce frown. &#39;I can&#39;t belive this, it&#39;s only been a few hours, and 
I&#39;m already liking these people. I&#39;m not supposed to like them,&#39; she 
angrily thought, &#39;concentrate on your mission from Diamond, damn it! 
I&#39;m here to take out Haruka, not make nice with the locals.&#39;

&quot;Thanks for the help,&quot; she heard, and turned to meet Rei&#39;s amused gaze 
as she continued, &quot;but I think that table&#39;s as clean as it&#39;s going to 
get.&quot; She looked down and realized she&#39;d been busily scrubbing just 
one spot for a bit.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Emerald said, blushing. &quot;I got a bit distracted,&quot; she 
admitted softly.

Looking around, she noticed Ami was leaning back in a chair by the 
hearth, her face rather strained. It looked like the childbirth hadn&#39;t 
been quite as easy as Minako had implied. &#39;Probably downplayed it so 
Makoto didn&#39;t get alarmed,&#39; Emerald thought. She poured a coffee from 
a nearby urn and took it over to the young doctor.

Ami&#39;s nose twitched, and her eyes opened, an honest smile apearing on 
her tired face. &quot;Ah, coffee,&quot; she sighed, taking the cup in her hands 
and having a small sip, &quot;nectar of the gods, I swear.&quot; She gave 
Emerald a warm smile, &quot;Thank you very much, Emi.&quot;

A bit of blush apeared on Emerald&#39;s face, &quot;Your welcome.&quot; She walked 
away, &#39;These people are way too easy to like.&#39;

There was a soft sound on the stairs as Usagi and Hotaru came down 
them. The taller blonde looked a bit strange with the older, dark 
hared woman, but the seemed to be happy together. As far as Emerald 
could tell, anyway.

&quot;Have a good time?&quot; Minako asked the two of them archly.

A blush appeared on both young ladies cheeks. &quot;More than good, thank 
you,&quot; Hotaru answered her with as much dignity as she could muster.

Rei had a little frown on her face. &quot;Have you told Setsuna about the 
two of you, yet?&quot; she directed the question to Usagi.

The blonde blushed brighter, &quot;No, I have not told Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;Told me what?&quot; Setsuna asked, coming back in from the porch, giving a 
fairwell to their last few patrons of the day.

&quot;About your gift, of course,&quot; Hotaru said, improvising an answer 
quickly, &quot;we don&#39;t want to spoil the surprise, do we?&quot;

&quot;I guess not,&quot; Setsuna said, giving the dark hared girl an odd look. 
She looked like she was getting ready to ask some pointed question, 
when they were interupted.

Makoto stood her head out of the kitchen, ringing a small bell. 
&quot;Dinner&#39;s ready,&quot; she announced, &quot;get the table ready and let&#39;s go!&quot;

&quot;Saved by the bell,&quot; Usagi sighed softly.

Haruka and Michiru came back downstairs together, a pale flush to 
their cheeks. Both had changed clothes, and looked a little bit 
neater. Everyone gathered around the long table, and the platters of 
food began to appear like magic. Three, four, then five separate 
dighes were laid out, each one of them smelling absolutely marvelous.

Emerald took a forkful hesitantly, almost afraid that the taste 
wouldn&#39;t be able to live up to the smell. She put it into her mouth, 
chewed a bit, then her eyes grew wide. &quot;Marvelous,&quot; she softly sighed 
after swallowing her mouthful.

Haruka was often adjusting the napkin laid across her lap, and each 
time she did Michiru, who was sitting right beside her, would blush 
brightly. Emerald rather suspected that there was a lot more going on 
under the table than just napkin adjustment.

From the head of the table, Setsuna would give a scolding glance to 
all the loving couples, but it only stopped them a few moments. Then 
the games under the table would begin again.

A foot brushed Emerald&#39;s leg, and she blushed, looking around her 
wildly.

Minako met her eyes with a gin, mouthing at her silently, &quot;I missed.&quot;

It took all Emerald&#39;s self control not to start laughing, especially 
after she saw the look on Rei&#39;s face when Minako actually succeeded.
