-----------------------------------------------------------  	

Rei Hino stripped out of her private school uniform, placing  the 
jacket carefully on a hangar.  She padded to the closet in her bare  
feet, naked save for a pair of red panties (her favorite color) and  
hung the jacket up.  Before she donned the miko robes for her  evening 
chores at the shrine, Rei flipped her long black hair back and  let 
the gentle fall air caress her slim, soft body.  The school jacket  
was hot and the robes weren&#39;t much better, so she tried to squeeze in  
every second of cool naked freedom she could.

The mental image of her running naked through the shrine like  some 
demented nymph suddenly entered her mind and brought a smile to  Rei&#39;s 
face as she slipped the robe on.  Where did that come from, she  
wondered?  Rei knotted the sash at her waist.  She&#39;d never have the  
nerve of course, but wouldn&#39;t it be wild?  Yuuichiro would probably  
burst a blood vessel if he saw her like that.  And what if the other  
Sailor Senshi were there and saw her?

What if Usagi saw her?

Suddenly Rei felt a throb in her groin and an empty hole in her  
chest.  She exhaled a deep sigh of frustration.  Usagi would probably  
faint - - or laugh - - or her eyes would explode - - or she&#39;d take  
pictures and pass them around her school.  But the last thing she&#39;d do  
would be what Rei secretly wanted her to do.  The girl was completely  
clueless.  If Rei hit her over the head with the truth, Usagi still  
wouldn&#39;t pick up on it.  Besides, Usagi only had eyes for Mamoru.  	

Rei walked out to the garden to check the discarded fortune tree.   
She didn&#39;t blame Usagi.  Mamoru was a great guy: Smart, gentle,  
protective, sexy.  She&#39;d be a fool not to be in love with him!  
Besides, they were fated to be together.  But all that left Rei was 
enduring  Yuuichiro and spending her nights dating the first two 
fingers of her  right hand.  	

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Granddaughter?&quot; Rei&#39;s Grandpa asked, appearing  behind 
her like a spirit.  	

&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t sneak up on me like that!&quot; Rei fumed.

&quot;Keeps you on your toes,&quot; chuckled Grandpa, his moon face  beaming.  
&quot;But if you weren&#39;t so preoccupied, you would have heard me.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; sighed Rei.  &quot;I&#39;m. . .it&#39;s nothing.&quot;

&quot;Well it seems like a pretty big nothing.  If you don&#39;t want to  tell 
me, I understand and accept that.  But sitting here moping about  it 
won&#39;t accomplish anything.&quot;  He winked at her encouragingly.  &quot;Try  
your luck at o-mi-kuji.  Maybe that has the answer you&#39;re looking 
for.&quot;  

&quot;No,&quot; shied Rei.  &quot;There&#39;s no sense in wishing for something  you 
can&#39;t have.&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; Grandpa said, taking the girl&#39;s hands in his, &quot;if  there&#39;s one 
thing I&#39;ve learned, it&#39;s that you can never predict the  fates.  
Nothing is absolute, so never assume.  But a question that isn&#39;t  
asked can&#39;t be answered.  If the answer is no, you accept it and move  
on.  But it might be yes.&quot;  His chubby face beamed with a mega-watt  
smile.

&quot;OK, Grandpa,&quot; smiled Rei.  &quot;Now don&#39;t you have some chores to  do?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve got Yuuichiro doing them,&quot; he whispered conspiratorially  to 
Rei.  Then he chuckled and scampered off.  Rei shook her head.  How  
could he have spent all this time on Earth and not grown up yet?  

Going inside, she picked up the tube, hesitated, then shook out a 
stick.  The number was, ironically, 69.  Leafing through the book to  
interpret the number, she found a curious passage.  

&quot;Your heart&#39;s desire will give you a blessing of ash.&quot;

&quot;Well that doesn&#39;t sound very encouraging,&quot; Rei thought.  &quot;Maybe it&#39;s 
better that I don&#39;t understand it.&quot;

Taking the fortune outside, Rei tied it to a branch of the tree.   The 
young miko stared at the branch for a few moments, biting her lip.   
Then she turned to get her broom.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sunday was a dark, rainy, dreary day.  Yuuichiro was off - -  
somewhere.  Rei didn&#39;t know and at the moment didn&#39;t care.  Grandpa 
was  off &quot;spreading the word&quot; - - meaning he was ogling teenage girls 
at the  mall.  The shrine was deserted because it was raining so 
heavily that  no one who didn&#39;t have to would venture out into it and 
she couldn&#39;t go  anywhere for the same reason.

&quot;This bites,&quot; scowled Rei, wandering around the shrine in  boredom.  
She stopped at the cabinet of incense, charms, candles and  oils they 
sold and picked up a small vial.  Popping the top, Rei  smelled the 
scent of jasmine filling the room.  She smiled.

&quot;I think I need to soak in a nice hot bath,&quot; Rei said to herself.   &quot;A 
bath loaded with this.&quot;

Ten minutes later Rei was reclining naked in a sunken tub.  Her  body 
was limp, immersed in the hot water, her head lolled back on the  side 
of the bath and her senses were swimming in a jasmine-induced  
euphoria.  Her beautiful face relaxed and a smile of contentment 
curled  her red lips.

Her hand drifted through the water up to the nipple of her  right 
breast.  The tip of the second finger stroked it lightly.  Her  chest 
shuddered and her lips curled more.

Seeking greater heights, she stroked harder, tracing around the  
aureole.  The muscles in her groin tightened, demanding attention.  
Her  left hand floated down between her legs.  She lightly touched her 
vulva, taunting herself, then gave in and began stroking the passage 
entrance.  Drifting along with the sensations, her hands on 
auto-pilot, Rei lost  herself in her efforts and the growing 
excitement she felt.

The loud rap of the door-knocker wrenched Rei out of her  reverie.  
She expelled a frustrated curse and reluctantly climbed out  of her 
scented bath.

&quot;This better be good,&quot; she growled, donning her robe.  As she  crossed 
the shrine, dripping and her hair still pinned up, Rei heard  the 
caller rap on the door again impatiently.  &quot;All right, I&#39;m coming!&quot;  
Rei snapped.  &quot;Who&#39;d be stupid enough to be out on a day like this  
anyway?&quot;

Rei opened the door and found Usagi waiting.  Her clothes were  
drenched.  Her skin was soaked.  Her blonde hair was limp and 
plastered  to her, the balls frazzled and coming undone.  She looked 
like a very  large, very miserable drowned rat.

&quot;Usagi?&quot; gasped Rei.  &quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;My umbrella turned inside out!&quot; Usagi cried in frustration,  shaking 
the bent, useless item at Rei.  &quot;What took you so long?  I&#39;m  soaked!&quot;

&quot;I was in the bath!&quot; Rei snapped impatiently.  &quot;Come on in.&quot;   She 
escorted Usagi into the shrine.  &quot;What are you doing out in this  
weather anyway?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m. . .um. . .uh. . .&quot; Usagi murmured, searching her memory  
fruitlessly.

&quot;You don&#39;t remember?&quot; gasped Rei in exasperation.

&quot;Well I was too busy trying NOT TO DROWN!&quot; bellowed Usagi.   &quot;You are 
so mean!&quot; and she turned her back on Rei, arms folded over her  chest.

The young fire goddess&#39;s eyes blazed with momentary fury.  Then  she 
noticed Usagi shivering and her anger drained into sympathy.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rei huffed, grasping Usagi&#39;s wrist and leading her  into 
the temple.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; blustered Usagi.

&quot;You&#39;re shivering,&quot; scolded Rei.  &quot;Get out of those wet clothes  and 
get into a hot bath.  A hot bath YOU interrupted.&quot;

&quot;How am I supposed to know when you&#39;re taking a bath!&quot; Usagi  
sputtered.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you print it in the newspaper if it&#39;s so  
important!&quot;

&quot;And let every guy in Juuban know when they can stare at this  
heavenly body,&quot; joked Rei.

&quot;Heavenly stick is more like it.&quot;

&quot;Who are you calling a stick, Thunder Thighs?&quot;

&quot;Rei Hino, don&#39;t you EVER CALL ME THAT!&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

After hanging up Usagi&#39;s clothes to dry, Rei returned to the  bath 
with a steaming pot of water.  Usagi was lounging in the bath, as  
limp and as contented as Rei had been.  Seeing Usagi content gave Rei 
a  good feeling.  Seeing her naked, though, gave her a different one.

She knelt down next to the bath and poured the hot water in.   The act 
drew a sigh from Usagi.  

&quot;Ooooh, that&#39;s good,&quot; she heaved.  &quot;And this bath smells so  nice.  
What is it?&quot;

&quot;Jasmine oil,&quot; Rei smiled.  &quot;We sell it here.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m buying ten,&quot; grinned Usagi, her eyes closed.  &quot;When I get  some 
money.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll give you a vial,&quot; chuckled Rei.

&quot;You will?&quot; Usagi grinned, looking up at Rei.  &quot;Oh, thank you  so. . 
.&quot; Then Usagi stopped and blushed beet red. Rei was puzzled by the 
reaction.  She glanced down to where  Usagi was looking and found her 
robe had fallen open, displaying her  cleavage.

&quot;What are you embarrassed about?&quot; she huffed, amused and  annoyed at 
the same time.  &quot;You&#39;re sitting there naked and YOU&#39;RE  embarrassed 
about seeing my BREASTS?&quot;

&quot;I,&quot; Usagi said, turning away timidly.  Her hand went between  her 
legs modestly.  &quot;Well, it&#39;s - - they&#39;re nice breasts.  Nicer than  
mine.&quot;

The comment threw Rei for a loop.

&quot;Everything about you is nicer than me,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;well,  except 
your personality.&quot;  Rei smirked in spite of herself.  &quot;But  you&#39;re so 
beautiful and exotic and stylish.  I-I. . .&quot; and Usagi turned  her 
face up at Rei, a fragile glass doll fearing she&#39;d be crushed at  any 
moment.

&quot;What are you babbling about, silly?&quot; Rei said softly, a  bemused grin 
on her face.  &quot;You&#39;re more beautiful than I could ever  hope to be.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m not,&quot; Usagi mumbled, turning away.  &quot;I&#39;m clumsy and  goofy 
and, well. . .&quot;

&quot;Sweet and kind and happy,&quot; Rei said gently.  &quot;And you have a  cute 
face.  And your breasts are just as nice as mine.&quot;

&quot;No they&#39;re not.&quot;

&quot;Nicer.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tease me like that!&quot; bellowed Usagi, lurching up at Rei  from 
the bath.

&quot;I&#39;m not teasing, you thick-headed idiot!&quot; raged Rei.&quot;

You are!  You,&quot; and Usagi stopped dead.  They both realized  they were 
nose to nose.  The jasmine coated the air with an erotic  sheen.  The 
two girls looked in each other&#39;s eyes and saw their deepest  secrets 
mirrored in the other one.  Rei swallowed.  Usagi barely  breathed.  
Then, after a hundred years, she moved forward timidly until  her 
mouth was a fraction of an inch from Rei&#39;s.    

The skin of their lips touched.  Rei held perfectly still for  fear of 
spooking Usagi into retreating.  Her breath mingled with that  of her 
princess, when she could find the strength to breathe.  Usagi&#39;s  kiss 
burned.  Rei&#39;s heart thudded to a halt.  She felt light-headed,  like 
she was about to faint.  Then Usagi withdrew fearfully.  Just like  
that her lips were gone and Rei instantly missed them.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Usagi squeaked, fearing Rei&#39;s vaunted wrath.

&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Rei smiled gratefully.  &quot;I liked it.&quot;  Usagi&#39;s eyes  lit up 
with relief and something more.  &quot;May I kiss you?&quot;

Usagi nodded, intimidated and yet intrigued by what lay before  her.  
Rei bent in and cupped the back of Usagi&#39;s head with her right  hand.  
Her lips met Usagi&#39;s, respectfully at first, but in seconds the  kiss 
surged with the passion she&#39;d felt for Usagi for all this time.   Her 
princess seemed to respond, arching her body up against Rei&#39;s,  
snaking her arms around Rei&#39;s torso.  The feel of the slim, soft,  
yielding body against hers, separated only by the robe, was heavenly.   
Usagi&#39;s nipples, hard and swollen, pressed against Rei&#39;s breasts and  
her shifting body caused the robe to rub against Rei&#39;s own erect  
nipples.  Usagi&#39;s own scent mixed with the jasmine and filled Rei&#39;s  
nostrils and head.

This must be what lust smells like, she thought.

Finally the two came up for air.  Usagi looked like she was  about to 
swoon and Rei wasn&#39;t far behind her.

&quot;I-I think it&#39;s the jasmine making me do this,&quot; Usagi alibied  weakly.

&quot;I&#39;m not screaming for help, am I?&quot; grinned Rei.

&quot;Do you,&quot; she began shyly, &quot;want to come in?&quot;

It took Rei a few moments to figure out Usagi meant the bath.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rei smiled.  She began to slip her robe off.

Usagi reached up and took the lapels of the robe from Rei.  She  eased 
robe down slowly, trapping Rei&#39;s arms to her sides as she exposed  the 
girl&#39;s torso.  Usagi&#39;s face was level with Rei&#39;s chest.  She leaned  
in and kissed Rei&#39;s breastbone.  A surge of desire flooded through the  
young priestess.  Usagi kissed her breastbone again, then began 
licking  the skin with long, luxurious strokes.  As she worked her way 
down to  Rei&#39;s left breast, the fiery young priestess squirmed and 
moaned,  trapped by the folds of the robe drawn tight around her and 
helpless to  escape.  At once, Rei wondered in between gasps of joy 
why she would  want to.

Finally Usagi relented and slipped the robe off the girl.  Once  she 
was nude, Rei slipped into the bath.  Usagi looked down demurely as  
Rei gathered her in her arms.  The girls molded to one another,  
surrounded by the warm water, and nuzzled.

&quot;Do you really think I&#39;m beautiful?&quot; Usagi whispered.

&quot;Yes, silly.  Every guy loves you the moment they meet you.  I&#39;m  so 
jealous.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re beautiful, too,&quot; Usagi replied.  She caressed Rei&#39;s  arm.  
&quot;Your skin is so soft.&quot;

Their stomach&#39;s pressed together.  Rei was gripped by a sudden  
longing and her hand crawled between her own legs.  The stimulation  
melded with her already enflamed passions.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; whispered Usagi.

&quot;What do you think I&#39;m doing?&quot; Rei said, her annoyance blunted  by her 
passions.  Mischievously, she moved her hand from her sex to  Usagi&#39;s 
and Usagi jumped.

&quot;Rei, keep your hands to yourself!&quot; gasped Usagi.

&quot;No,&quot; Rei smirked devilishly.  &quot;I like the way you jump.&quot;  She  groped 
Usagi again and the blonde sucked in a loud breath of air.

&quot;I&#39;ll,&quot; groaned Usagi, &quot;get you!&quot;  Her hand moved to Rei&#39;s  groin and 
Rei felt her own breath catch.  From that point on, Usagi  would mimic 
every move Rei made.  When Rei stroked Usagi&#39;s vulva, Usagi  would do 
the same.  When Rei grazed the girl&#39;s clitoris, drawing a  squeal from 
her, Usagi probed doggedly until she drew the same squeal  from Rei.  
When Rei penetrated with a finger, so did Usagi.  The girls  stiffened 
against each other.  Each girl was determined to outlast the  other, 
to arouse the other into submission.  Their efforts succeeded in  
producing a chorus of moans and high-pitched sighs.

&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot; sobbed Usagi after a while.

&quot;Did I hurt you?&quot; panted Rei.

&quot;It was a good hurt,&quot; she smiled, her forehead glistening with  
perspiration.

&quot;What does that mean?  Did you come?&quot;

&quot;Rei, you don&#39;t talk about things like that!&quot; blushed Usagi.

&quot;We&#39;re naked in a bath and feeling each other up and talking  about 
coming embarrasses you?&quot;

Usagi scowled petulantly at her.  Then she splashed water in  Rei&#39;s 
face.

&quot;You little. . .&quot; Rei gasped in mock anger.  Instantly the bath  
erupted, both girls splashing each other and giggling.

&quot;All right, all right!&quot; squealed Usagi after a time.  &quot;I quit!   You 
win!&quot;

&quot;Then I&#39;m claiming my prize,&quot; Rei rumbled.

She grabbed Usagi around the waist and pushed slightly.  Usagi  lost 
her balance and tumbled backward into the bath, shrieking as she  
fell.  A wave kicked up, overflowing the walls of the bath.  Usagi lay  
on her back, giggling helplessly while Rei pinned her down and lapped  
at her left nipple and the water filled back in around them.  Soon  
Usagi&#39;s giggles turned to groans and she was squirming under Rei&#39;s  
weight.

&quot;Rei,&quot; sighed Usagi, her voice heavy with ardor.  &quot;Rei, stop.   
Please?&quot;

&quot;Am I going too fast?&quot; asked Rei timidly.  Usagi smirked.

&quot;No, I&#39;m just getting all pruney,&quot; she giggled.  &quot;And the bath  
water&#39;s cold.  Maybe we better get out.&quot;

&quot;Maybe you&#39;re right.&quot;

Rei pulled herself out of the sunken bath and padded over to  the 
bench she&#39;d put towels on.  She tossed one to Usagi.  As she dried  
herself with the plush white terry-cloth, Rei wanted to say something  
nice to Usagi.  However she kept silent, for fear of somehow saying 
the  wrong thing, as she so often did, and ruining this dream-like 
mood.   She pulled the pins out of her hair and shook the black mane 
out as it  fell down her back.

She glanced over at Usagi, drying her very pert, very curvy,  very 
feminine body, demurely facing away from Rei.  Bereft of its  &quot;odango&quot; 
hairstyle, her blonde locks fell loosely down her back.  She  looked 
so different this way, so naturally beautiful, like a forest  spirit 
who had wandered into Rei&#39;s bath.  The young priestess turned  away, 
lest Usagi notice her tremulous admiration.

Out of the blue, Rei felt a sting on her ass.  She jumped and  turned 
around to find Usagi with a rolled up towel and a guilty  expression.

&quot;You treacherous little. . .!&quot; Rei fumed playfully.  &quot;I&#39;ll get  you 
for that!&quot;

Rei lunged at the girl.  Usagi dodged, squealing, and barreled  out 
the door with Rei in hot pursuit.  The girls chased each other  
through the cavernous shrine, both totally naked and Usagi shrieking 
in  mock terror.  She was finally cornered in, to Rei&#39;s amusement, the  
bedroom.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Usagi giggled between gasps for air.  Then she  locked 
eyes with Rei and grew sober.  &quot;Let me make it up to you.&quot;

Gliding up like a goddess, Usagi took Rei&#39;s hands and led her  over to 
the futon.  She guided her friend down gently onto the mattress, then 
perched over the girl&#39;s bent knees.  Her hands grasped Rei&#39;s knees  as 
she looked at Rei, beaming with warm desire, then guided her legs  
open.  Anticipation gripped the young fire goddess&#39;s body as Usagi&#39;s  
face neared her pubic area.

The stroke of Usagi&#39;s tongue was like a gigantic hand cradling  her, 
lifting her up into the heavens until she floated among the  clouds.  
Rei&#39;s teeth bit into her lower lip.  Her hands made fists and  pulled 
at the sheets.  The muscles from her groin to her sternum  contracted 
into steel bands.  

&quot;Uhh,&quot; she groaned.  &quot;U-Usagi. . .&quot;

Usagi&#39;s tongue grazed her lover&#39;s clitoris in passing and Rei  felt a 
tremor run up her body.  Her eyes closed.  Her mouth opened,  though 
no sound came out.  Usagi brushed it again and that wrenched a  
high-pitched squeal from her.  Rel felt her toes curl and her lower  
abdomen try to push up through her throat.

&quot;Oh!&quot; she cried.  &quot;OHHHHHHH!&quot;

The climax washed over her like a tsunami.  Rei&#39;s eyes snapped  open 
and she could see the texture of the ceiling as if it were inches  
from her face.  Then things clouded over as tears gathered in her 
eyes.

The tidal wave of satisfaction receded and Rei exhaled a deep,  
contented sigh.  She wondered if she could ever possibly feel this 
good  again.  Then she felt Usagi licking again.

&quot;U-Usagi!&quot; Rei gasped.  &quot;D-Don&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Mmf!  Can&#39;t hear you,&quot; Usagi mumbled between strokes of her  tongue.

Rei threw her head back, certain she couldn&#39;t endure such  wonderful 
torture.  Usagi continued to lap at her like some mutant five  foot 
blonde cat.

&quot;Oh!  Oh, yes!  Oh, yesssss!&quot; Rei screamed as the second climax  
flowered.  She forgot how to breathe.  Her hips felt like they were  
going to detach from her body.

And Usagi continued relentlessly.

Rei&#39;s consciousness was bobbing like a cork on a sea of  ecstasy.  She 
couldn&#39;t focus enough to string two words together.  Her  entire being 
was centered on the several inches of flesh that Usagi&#39;s  tongue was 
caressing with the passion of a lover and the skill of an  artist.

The young priestess could sense a third climax firing up.  This  was 
unexplored territory and there was fear in her.  But she continued  on 
and her passion expanded exponentially, filling her up completely.

&quot;Ohhhhh!&quot; she wailed pitifully.  &quot;Usagi, stop!  Please stop!&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Usagi whispered, grinning ear to ear.  &quot;Since you  asked 
nicely.&quot;  Rei gazed at Usagi, so much in love.  She felt drained,  and 
yet energized to the point where she could run a marathon.  &quot;You  
taste salty,&quot; Usagi smirked.   Laughter burst from Rei&#39;s chest.

Her hand extended to the girl.  Usagi took it and eased up the  futon 
so they were face to face.  Their foreheads touched.  Rei&#39;s leg  
forced between Usagi&#39;s thighs and pressed gently to her wet sex.  
Usagi  sucked in air and looked at her lover with hooded eyes.  Rei 
cradled  one arm around Usagi.  Her other hand pressed to Usagi&#39;s 
chest,  directly over her heart, then massaged lightly.  

&quot;I don&#39;t know why I did this,&quot; Usagi whispered timidly, &quot;but  I&#39;m glad 
I did.  I love you forever, Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve always loved you forever, Usagi-chan,&quot; whispered Rei.

Her left arm kept Usagi captured.  Rei&#39;s mouth slid down to  Usagi&#39;s 
neck and shoulder.  She kissed them reverently, her right hand  fell 
to Usagi&#39;s left breast and she gently stroked the nipple with her  
thumb.  Rei&#39;s thigh stayed pressed up to Usagi&#39;s sex.

Usagi&#39;s eyes jammed shut.  She whimpered under the weight of  her 
mounting passions and clung tightly to her friend.

------------------------------------------------------------

Rei woke with the slam of the shrine front door.  She listened  to the 
slap of sandals on the floor.  Grandpa was back.  Glancing over  to 
the warm body next to her - - the warm body with her mouth wide open  
and drool trickling onto the sheet - - Rei nudged her.  It took 
several  prods to wake Usagi.  Rei&#39;s hand instantly covered Usagi&#39;s 
mouth.

&quot;Shh!&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;Grandpa&#39;s home.  Maybe you&#39;d better go.   I&#39;ll 
get your clothes.&quot;

Sneaking over to the room, Rei retrieved Usagi&#39;s clothes.   Sneaking 
back undetected, the two girls got dressed.  They eased  cautiously 
out of the room and wound up face to face with Grandpa.  

&quot;Oh!&quot; gasped Rei in surprise.  Usagi bumped into Rei, staggered  
backwards and fell on her ass.  &quot;You&#39;re back, Grandpa!&quot;  She quickly  
helped Usagi up.

&quot;Had to wait out the storm, or I&#39;d have been back sooner,&quot;  Grandpa 
replied, eyeing the two girls suspiciously.

&quot;Um, yeah.  Has it stopped raining?  That&#39;s what Usagi was  doing, 
too!&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir, that&#39;s all we were doing!&quot; echoed Usagi.  Rei nudged  her 
with an elbow to the ribs.

&quot;Um hmm,&quot; replied Grandpa.

&quot;Well, I guess you need to be getting back, huh Usagi?&quot; Rei  hinted, 
herding Usagi toward the door.  

&quot;Oh, uh, yeah,&quot; Usagi said, staggering to the door.  She picked  up 
her broken umbrella for some reason, glanced back at Rei with a  
mixture of warmth and uncertainty, then disappeared out the door.

&quot;Boy, it was lucky for me Usagi stopped by,&quot; Rei babbled.   &quot;Sure 
would have been boring without her.  We must have talked the  whole 
afternoon away.&quot;

&quot;Rei.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Grandpa?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t ask.  You don&#39;t have to tell me.  If you&#39;re happy,  that&#39;s 
all that matters.&quot;

Rei blushed.  Her grandpa turned and walked away.  He stopped a  few 
paces on, turned and looked Rei up and down, then walked off  
chuckling to himself.

------------------------------------------------------------

Monday morning came and suddenly Sunday seemed like a dream.   Rei 
donned her school uniform with a deep, spiritual satisfaction and  at 
the same time an urgent need to see Usagi again.  Could they achieve  
that level of passion again?  She didn&#39;t know, but she wanted to try 
as  soon as possible.  

As she descended the steps of the shrine, Rei caught sight of  Usagi 
standing at the bottom step.  Her spirits lifted and her heart  beat 
faster until she saw the miserable expression on Usagi&#39;s face.   She 
didn&#39;t have to be psychic to know she wasn&#39;t going to like this.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi squeaked.  &quot;About yesterday.&quot;

Rei stared neutrally.

&quot;I&#39;M SORRY!&quot; Usagi wailed, bursting into tears.  &quot;I don&#39;t want  to 
hurt you!  That&#39;s the last thing in the world I want to do, but I  
don&#39;t know what else to do!&quot;

&quot;Calm down, Usagi,&quot; sighed Rei.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I was thinking yesterday!&quot; cried Usagi.  &quot;I&#39;m  not 
like that!  Believe me, I&#39;m not!&quot;

&quot;Neither am I,&quot; bristled Rei, &quot;but I thought yesterday was  
beautiful.&quot;

&quot;So do I!  Rei-chan, please believe me, yesterday was one of  the most 
beautiful days of my life!  It was!  I-I love you, Rei!  I do!  I love 
you in a way I could never love Mamo-chan!&quot;

&quot;I sense a &#39;but&#39; coming,&quot; whispered Rei hoarsely.  Usagi&#39;s eyes  cast 
to the ground.

&quot;But,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;I love Mamo-chan, too.  And I love  him. . . 
in a way. . . I could never love you.  I&#39;m sorry.  I&#39;ve messed  
everything up.  You hate me and Mamo-chan&#39;s going to hate me. . .&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t hate you.&quot;

Usagi looked up, a glimmer of hope in her eyes.

&quot;I could never hate you,&quot; Rei grinned helplessly, &quot;no matter  how 
silly you act.  And - - Mamoru doesn&#39;t have to know.&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; Usagi whispered in awe.

&quot;You let me into your heart.  I&#39;m grateful, even if it was only  for 
one day.  And you&#39;ll be my friend for life.  What more do I have a  
right to ask for?&quot;

Usagi stared, blue eyes wide and wondrous.  Then the dam burst.   
Tears pouring down her, Usagi caught Rei in a bear hug and squeezed 
her  tight.

&quot;Thank you for understanding!&quot; she cried.

&quot;Thank you for yesterday,&quot; Rei replied, patting Usagi&#39;s back.   &quot;Now 
you better get going or you&#39;ll be late for school.  And more  
importantly, you&#39;ll make me late!&quot;

Usagi shoved away from Rei.  She looked at her watch, screeched  in 
alarm and tore down the street.  Rei followed her with her gaze.   The 
ache in her chest was back.  	Glancing back at the shrine, she 
saw the fortune tree.  Only one of the fortunes had washed off the 
branches in the storm.  Three guesses which one it probably was.

&quot;Thanks a lot,&quot; she grumbled.

But as she walked to school, she recalled some words of wisdom,  words 
she herself once told Minako.    

&quot;If you love someone, you have to do what&#39;s best for them - -  even if 
what&#39;s best is letting them be with the one they love.&quot;

It was the right thing to do.  It was the noble thing to do.

But why did doing the noble thing have to suck so often?</pre>
