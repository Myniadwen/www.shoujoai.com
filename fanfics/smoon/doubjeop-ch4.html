Ami could feel herself waking up. Everything hurt. She felt like she had 
survived being hit by a Mack truck. Then her brain started to catch up 
with her and she started to remember everything she had gone through 
over the last few days. The senshi of ice realized that an 
eighteen-wheeler was close enough to the truth. Finally she opened her 
eyes to see where she was.

The room was dark, but not so dark she couldn&#39;t see. There was a very 
soft blue light on overhead. Ami mused that it was probably to keep her 
eyes from hurting. She figured the light would probably very slowly get 
brighter to help her eyes adjust to light, since this was a typical 
treatment for people who were deprived of light for a long amount of 
time. She noticed an IV inserted into a vein in her wrist. The room was 
your typical hospital room, complete with another one of those low TVs 
Makoto hated. As she continued to observe her surroundings, she noticed 
she wasn&#39;t alone.

Makoto was holding her hand, but apparently had fallen asleep that way. 
She was sitting in a chair, but had slumped over a bit and was leaning 
on the side of the bed. Ami couldn&#39;t help but be concerned for the fact 
that Makoto&#39;s neck was going to be sore when she woke up with her head 
tilted so awkwardly. Even though it hurt for her to move, Ami reached 
over with the hand Makoto wasn&#39;t holding, and gently stroked her green 
eyed friend&#39;s cheek.

Makoto woke, so startled that she jumped up out of the seat saying, 
&quot;Who! What! When! Where!&quot; as she rose. Just after getting the last word 
out, she banged her head on the low TV, yelping in pain. She rubbed the 
top of her head and her neck for a moment. Then she looked down at Ami, 
still in bed, and, gritting her teeth a little at the pain, still 
managed an embarrassed smile on her friend&#39;s behalf.

Ami looked up at her with a weak smile and answered Makoto&#39;s rhetorical 
questions in order. &quot;Its just me, I&#39;m sorry for waking you up. I can&#39;t 
tell if it&#39;s ante meridian or post meridian since we seem to be in a 
room without windows, but the clock on the wall says 5:30, and I think 
we are in Azabu Regional Medical Center.&quot; Then it was Ami&#39;s turn to feel 
less intelligent as she said shyly, &quot;You wouldn&#39;t happen to know what 
day it is, would you?&quot;

Since she just woke up, and from the splitting headache she now had, 
Makoto had to take a moment to answer. &quot;Tuesday morning, I think.&quot;

Ami looked down at her hands, glancing at the small hospital bracelet on 
her wrist for a few seconds, deep in thought. Then she said, &quot;It was 
only three days? It felt much longer than that.&quot; She closed her eyes as 
memories of her time as a captive came back to her, surprisingly vivid, 
and tried not to show her fear. She couldn&#39;t keep herself from shaking 
from some of the more brutal memories as they played in her head though. 
Unable to keep her voice from quivering, she said quietly, &quot;It was 
horrible, Makoto.&quot;

Makoto placed a hand on the smaller woman&#39;s trembling shoulder and asked 
sympathetically, with no pressure, &quot;Do you want to talk about it?&quot;

Ami took a few deep breaths and pulled herself back together. After a 
few moments she opened her eyes and looked at her friend. &quot;No, not yet. 
I just want to get on with my life and forget it, at least for now.&quot;

&quot;All right, but if you want to talk about it, you can come to me. I 
won&#39;t tell anyone unless you want me to, either.&quot; Makoto gave Ami&#39;s 
shoulder a gentle squeeze then added, &quot;We&#39;re here for you. Don&#39;t forget 
that.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Mako-chan. I will when I&#39;m ready, I promise.&quot; Then, sounding 
exhausted, Ami said, &quot;For now, I think I&#39;m going to go back to sleep 
though.&quot;

Makoto looked thoughtfully at Ami then said, &quot;As you wish, Ami-chan.&quot; 
Then Makoto put a backpack on a small side table that could be pulled up 
to the bed and pushed it near Ami. &quot;Minako went back to your place and 
packed a few things in here to help keep you entertained while you&#39;re 
stuck here. I&#39;m going to go find your mom and let her know you&#39;re awake. 
She wants to make sure you&#39;re all right.&quot; Then Makoto added 
reassuringly, &quot;I&#39;ll be back in a few minutes. The others left earlier 
this morning so I promised Id let them know when you came to.&quot;

Again, Ami thanked Makoto and watched her leave, right up until she 
realized Makoto was going to open the door. She pulled a pillow in front 
of her head to cover her eyes and waited to hear the door close. Then, 
instead of going to sleep, Ami started rummaging through the backpack, 
hoping Minako had the good sense to put her cell phone in there.

&quot;Just a quick text message. Pie Lover deserves that much, at least,&quot; Ami 
said to herself quietly.

Makoto was in a crowded elevator just a few moments later, when her cell 
phone started vibrating. She opened it and realized it was a text 
message. As soon as she saw who it was from, she said out loud 
excitedly, &quot;PBJ!&quot; and ignored the looks of surprise and confusion from 
the other occupants of the elevator as she excitedly typed a greeting. 
She was so happy to hear from her secret girlfriend that she didn&#39;t even 
stop to think why the other woman would be up this early.

PBJ1978 has signed on at 5:40AM

PBJ1978: I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re there or not... but I figured I&#39;d let 
you know I&#39;m good. Just wound up with some computer problems. I 
apologize for not contacting you sooner. I&#39;ve missed you.

CherryPieLover: That&#39;s OK. I figured that, but I was beginning to worry 
you had met someone else more interesting. I missed you too!

PBJ1978: No! No! The only person in my life who would really give you a 
run for your money isn&#39;t interested in other women. So you have nothing 
to worry about.

Makoto smiled at that comment as she walked out the elevator.

CherryPieLover: Her loss. Straight or not, she&#39;d be a fool to turn down 
someone as sweet as you :D

PBJ1978: Yeah I guess . . . well, I need to get some rest. I&#39;ll talk to 
you again later.

CherryPieLover: OK. Just give me a buzz when you&#39;re ready to chat again!

PBJ1978 has signed off at 5:45AM

Makoto sighed quietly as she put her cell phone back in her pocket. &quot;I 
can&#39;t wait to finally see her in person.&quot;

Dr. Hana Mizuno had shown her where her office was the night before, and 
Makoto now found herself at the door. She knocked quietly, then opened 
the door once Ami&#39;s mom told her to come in.

The room was another small interior room with no windows. Dr. Mizuno&#39;s 
office had a professional and plain appearance to it. There was a desk 
with a picture of Ami and her mother from Ami&#39;s graduation from college, 
as well as Dr. Mizuno&#39;s nameplate and a flat screen monitor off to the 
side of it situated so Dr. Mizuno could see the door. A chair in front 
of the desk for whomever wished to speak with her, a few filing 
cabinets, and a few medical charts and posters on the walls rounded out 
the remaining items. The room was a little dark since one of the 
florescent lights had burned out. Combined with the eerie electrical 
buzz from the working florescent light, the lower lighting gave the 
white room a creepy feel.

&quot;Ah, Kino,&quot; Hana said quietly, almost as if talking to a patient as she 
gestured to a chair in the small office opposite her desk. &quot;Lock the 
door, please. I have some things I&#39;d like to discuss with you. It won&#39;t 
take long. Please take a seat.&quot;

Makoto was a little puzzled as to why she was being asked to lock the 
door, but she did so and sat in the recommended seat. It always 
surprised Makoto how similar Dr. Mizuno was to Ami. The major 
differences were that her hair looked like it was a lighter blue due to 
her hair starting to turn gray, and she was slightly taller. She was 
wearing a lab coat with a stethoscope around her neck, and a name tag 
with &#39;Dr. Mizuno&#39; written on it. Ami&#39;s friends had often joked that all 
Ami would have to do is get ahold of her mother&#39;s work clothing and she 
could probably pass for her mother.

Even while sitting, Makoto still had to look down to make eye contact 
with her. &quot;Good morning, Dr. Mizuno. I came to tell you Ami is awake.&quot;

As Makoto spoke, Hana leaned forward in her chair, put her elbows on the 
desk, folded her hands together, and lowered her head so that her mouth 
was covered by her hands. Then Hana looked over her glasses into 
Makoto&#39;s eyes as if searching her very soul. Makoto couldn&#39;t help but 
think to herself that Ami always looked over her glasses at someone when 
she was irritated, angry, or surprised by the person. Obviously this was 
where her friend had gotten the habit. Whatever Hana Mizuno wanted to 
discuss, it probably wasn&#39;t something Makoto wanted to talk about.

As Makoto shifted in her seat, feeling suddenly even more uncomfortable 
under Dr. Mizuno&#39;s gaze, Hana spoke, not moving other than to blink her 
eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll be sure to visit her shortly. Since we are both busy people, 
Miss Kino, I will get straight to the point. Recent events have forced 
me to face an unfortunate truth about my daughter&#39;s life.&quot; Narrowing her 
eyes she said simply, &quot;I know your secret.&quot;

The taller woman tilted her head to to the side a little. She doubted 
Hana knew Makoto&#39;s true feelings for Ami, or about her online 
relationship. Even if she knew about that, Hana never struck her as 
homophobic. That left only one other secret in her life and there was no 
way in hell that Ami&#39;s mother knew about that, could she? &quot;Excuse me, 
Doctor, I don&#39;t mean to be rude, but any secrets I may have, or that you 
think I have, are none of your concern.&quot;

The second the last word left Makoto&#39;s mouth, Hana slammed her hands 
down on the desk so hard that the picture fell over and her name plate 
slid off the desk clattering as it hit the floor. She stood up and 
arched her back so her eyes were now level with the younger woman&#39;s. The 
anger flashing in her eyes was intense, and for a moment Makoto thought 
Dr. Mizuno was going to jump over the desk and strangle her. Instead, 
shaking with rage, Hana spoke so quietly that Makoto had to strain to 
hear her. &quot;My daughter, my only child, is 3 floors above us in a 
hospital room recovering from a severe beating, dehydration, light 
deprivation, and is being treated for a concussion for the second time 
in less than a week.&quot; Then, leaning forward so her nose was almost 
touching Makoto&#39;s, she said, &quot;I think the secret the nine of you are 
trying to hide so well and so long has suddenly very much become my 
concern.&quot;

Makoto hadn&#39;t had her parents to yell at her for nearly 19 years now, 
but she had a feeling that the cold sensation in her stomach was 
probably what it felt like to be caught in a lie by one of them. Making 
one last attempt to throw Hana off, Makoto said angrily, trying to force 
as much confusion into her voice as she could, and rising to her feet to 
try to intimidate the smaller woman with her height, &quot;What the hell are 
you talking about, Hana Mizuno?&quot;

Ami&#39;s mother looked up at Makoto for a moment before speaking. &quot;You, my 
daughter, and your entire group of close-knit friends are the Sailor 
Senshi that show up in the news from time to time over the last 15 
years. You&#39;re considered both heroes of Tokyo, and as perhaps the most 
destructive gang in the history of the city based on how much damage 
seems to follow in your wake.&quot;

The green-eyed woman forced out a laugh, saying, &quot;I&#39;m rather surprised 
an upstanding doctor would actually believe in a silly urban legend like 
that. Look, I know you&#39;re concerned about your daughter, but you&#39;re way 
off! We told you what --&quot;

Makoto was cut off in mid-sentence when the small woman yelled out, &quot;You 
all lied to my face!&quot; Then, forcing herself to regain a bit of her 
normal calm demeanor, Dr. Mizuno started talking again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Makoto, you&#39;re right. I am concerned about my daughter. I love her 
dearly and I know a lot about her. Despite how close you and your 
friends may be to her, I&#39;m even willing to bet I know a few things you 
don&#39;t. I know I&#39;m right, and I know you know it.&quot;

Then she sat back down in her chair, slumping her shoulders a bit, 
looking suddenly old and worn out. &quot;I&#39;ve known for a long time now. I&#39;m 
not sure how long she has been involved, but I started to notice 
patterns in when she was late or didn&#39;t show up at home, and when events 
involving the Sailor Senshi would occur while she was in high school. 
The first year or so I passed it off as coincidence. Unfortunately, 
coincidence only accounts for a few events. Not over one hundred.&quot;

Taking Makoto&#39;s silence as permission to continue, Hana added as she 
opened a drawer and set a newspaper clipping in front of Makoto, &quot;A few 
years back, a reporter snapped this picture and attached it to an 
article. Most people dismissed it as a hoax, but I believe it is clear 
enough to prove my point.&quot; The picture in question was a blurry black 
and white picture of Makoto, Ami, Usagi, Rei, and Minako transformed 
into their alter egos. Only Ami&#39;s face was clear enough to see, though 
even it was pretty distorted from motion blur, bad lighting, and water 
since she was in the middle of an attack.. Not enough for most to place 
her, except perhaps her mother and closest friends.

Makoto read the article briefly and placed it from events about 5 years 
ago. A few leftover Yoma from way back when the Senshi had fought Beryl 
had decided to show up in the middle of a crowded mall to try to avenge 
their long-dead queen. Their attempts failed horribly, but the incident 
had made front page news for weeks, re-kindling the debate over whether 
the Sailor Senshi and their adventures were truth or myth, and whether 
they were helpful or harmful to the greater good of Tokyo. Also, as Dr. 
Mizuno had mentioned, the property damage to the Roppongi Hill&#39;s 
shopping center had been costly, to say the least.

The elder blue haired woman sighed, then continued. &quot;Several times she 
even admitted to me she was at those locations at the same time, but as 
a bystander. You all had to know you couldn&#39;t hide it forever. There 
were a few times I tried to bring it up with Ami, but she always changed 
the subject.&quot;

When Makoto didn&#39;t say anything, she continued, looking suddenly guilty. 
&quot;It&#39;s clear to me now I should have insisted. I know what she was doing 
was dangerous, but I also knew she believed in it enough to take the 
risk, and that she would be careful. Now however, one of her adventures 
has finally landed her in the hospital.&quot; Looking up at Makoto, she added 
sadly, &quot;I no longer feel I can take the risk. I can&#39;t bear the thought 
of losing her.&quot;

Finally admitting defeat, Makoto sat in her seat, looking down at her 
feet for a moment. This wasn&#39;t the conversation she was prepared for at 
all. It suddenly surprised her to realize that none of them had ever 
talked about what to do or say if someone actually did find out. 
Obviously, killing Ami&#39;s mother was out of the question. She was glad 
that at least the doctor wasn&#39;t asking for specifics on how Ami wound up 
how she did since that would have been impossible to describe to someone 
who hadn&#39;t seen their doubles with their own eyes. Once Makoto realized 
there was no point denying it, she asked, trying to choose her words 
carefully, &quot;So, you want me to ask her to quit? Why not talk to Ami 
yourself?&quot;

Hana quietly looked down at her desk as she thought of a reply. &quot;Yes. I 
want you to ask her to quit. She has gone to so much trouble to hide 
this from me. I feel like I would be betraying her somehow by letting 
her realize I&#39;m aware of her other identity. I want you specifically to 
talk to her because . . . &quot; Dr. Mizuno stopped for a moment, trying to 
think of a way to put her thoughts into words. &quot;Because she trusts you 
more than anyone. Even me.&quot;

The brunette looked at the doctor and replied quietly, &quot;I will ask her . 
. . but you have to know what the answer will be after 15 years. Not 
you, me, or anyone can convince her or the rest of us to give it up. 
It&#39;s a responsibility we all share and take seriously.&quot; Then Makoto 
said, &quot;You&#39;re a very intelligent woman, so you had to already know that. 
So that leaves the most obvious question. What do you want me to do when 
she says no?&quot;

As Makoto was talking, Hana walked around the desk to stand beside the 
taller woman. Once Makoto finished, Hana smiled and answered, &quot;You&#39;re 
Sailor Jupiter. If she says no, I want you to do your job. The planet 
Jupiter keeps many dangerous large asteroids and comets from hitting the 
planets within the inner part of the solar system due to its large size 
and gravitational pull, thus allowing life to survive on earth. I don&#39;t 
know much about the other group of your friends, but I know out of Ami&#39;s 
closest friends, you&#39;re the best fighter. You have quite the martial 
arts talent, I&#39;m told. You may be surprised to hear this, but Ami brags 
about it to me whenever you win a tournament.&quot; Looking up at Makoto with 
sincere respect, she finished, &quot;I want you to protect her. Keep her 
safe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll do my absolute best.&quot; Then Makoto looked down at Hana in 
confusion. &quot;OK. I can see how you knew we were the Sailor Senshi, but 
how did you know which specific one I am?&quot;

Hana grinned. &quot;Simple. First, Since you hit your last growth spurt 
toward the end of high school, you&#39;re the tallest out of all your 
friends. Logically, knowing that all the Senshi are named after planets 
save your leader, you match more of a physical description to the 
planet. Second, during your senior year of high school, Ami had the four 
of her closest friends over for a sleepover one nameless night.&quot; 
Chuckling at the memory, Hana finished. &quot;I came home in the middle of 
the night from work to find all of you passed out in the living room. 
Wouldn&#39;t you know your friend Usagi talks in her sleep?&quot;

Their conversation finished, Hana and Makoto made their way back up to 
Ami&#39;s hospital room. The trip was quiet all the way back since both were 
lost in their own thoughts. Makoto remembered checking her watch and 
seeing that it was only 6:30 AM. To her, it felt like the day should 
have been just about over with instead of just starting. When they 
opened the door to the room, it was Hana&#39;s turn for a surprise.

&quot;Hi Mom!&quot;Ami said with a smile after taking another sip of water from 
the cup she was holding. Ami had gotten out of bed and was sitting in a 
chair next to it. After Makoto left, she had decided to watch TV and 
catch up on the news. She was still drained a bit from her ordeal, and 
had a slight headache, but other than that she appeared fine.

Simple and innocent enough, except when Ami had been brought in last 
night, she could barely maintain her consciousness or stand. Let alone 
have the coordination to get out of bed and sit in a chair. Even her 
eyes, which should have taken another hour and a half to adjust to light 
at the least, weren&#39;t bothered at all by the light spilling in through 
the doorway. On top of that, all of the bruises she had from the 
previous night and most of the cuts were gone, and there was no sign of 
concussion. Instead of being extremely dizzy, dehydrated to the point of 
weakness, incredibly sore, and sensitive to light, Ami looked only 
mildly uncomfortable and slightly thirsty. Ami looked absolutely fine. 
Looking a little confused, Ami said, &quot;Mom? Are you OK?&quot;

Dr. Mizuno was standing in the door way with her jaw open and a 
dumbfounded look on her face. Makoto, squeezing between her and the door 
frame to get in, seemed to snap her out of it. Hana walked around the 
bed, staring at Ami as if she were looking at an alien. Ami got up, 
grabbed the post her IV was hanging from moving it with her, and walked 
to her mom, looking concerned. Once they were standing in front of each 
other, Hana said, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t be out of bed, never mind be able to 
walk.&quot; Searching for a way to respond to her daughter&#39;s question, Dr. 
Mizuno said, &quot;I&#39;m impressed, that&#39;s what I am. I know you always healed 
quicker than most people, but honey, you shouldn&#39;t even be able to see 
straight right now with how bad you were last night!&quot;

Makoto smiled as she watched. Dr. Mizuno knew Ami was a Sailor Senshi, 
but she didn&#39;t know just how fast they healed. They had all been beaten 
badly through their careers as Senshi, and were almost always able to 
get up and go to school or work the next morning. Makoto had expected 
Ami&#39;s stay in the hospital to be a day or two, but apparently it 
wouldn&#39;t even be that long.

Ami looked around nervously, trying to think of a response. &quot;Well you 
know, I have the best doctor in Tokyo. I personally chalk it up to great 
medical care . . . &quot;

Ami&#39;s mother was already listening to Ami&#39;s heart with a stethoscope and 
taking her pulse. Ami knew a few of the tricks in the book of medicine, 
so when her mother said, &quot;I need to take your pulse again since I lost 
count,&quot; which is medical speak for I&#39;m going to count your respirations 
now, Ami held her breath. Dr. Mizuno looked up at Ami&#39;s face and said, 
slightly annoyed yet at the same time amused by her daughter&#39;s antics, 
&quot;Knock it off.&quot;

While her mother searched for a sphygmomanometer to take Ami&#39;s blood 
pressure, Ami simply laughed and said, &quot;I&#39;m fine, Mom, I promise! I just 
needed a little medical care, a good night&#39;s sleep, and a little water.&quot;

Hana looked over her shoulder at Makoto as if for confirmation. Makoto 
just smiled and shrugged. Looking back at Ami, Dr. Mizuno said, &quot;All 
right, but I want you to stay at least for this afternoon for 
observation just to be on the safe side.&quot; Then trying to change the 
subject a little, the older blue haired woman said, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to 
get some coffee. I&#39;ll be back in a while to check on you. Whether you 
feel fine or not, I want you to get back in bed and stay there, and I 
want you to drink more water. Look after her for me, won&#39;t you, Makoto?&quot;

Makoto caught what Dr. Mizuno was really asking, and answered, &quot;Of 
course. She&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll let you know if anything happens.&quot; 
Satisfied with the brunette&#39;s reply, Hana gave Ami a hug, then walked 
out the door to wherever it was doctors go, closing the door quietly 
behind her.

Ami asked from across the room as she was getting back in bed, &quot;So, what 
did the two of you talk about?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Makoto said, sounding startled by the question, then looked away 
from Ami&#39;s face for a moment, suddenly interested in the opposing wall. 
&quot;Nothing. Nothing at all. Why?&quot;

Ami flopped back in her bed, putting her hands over her head as she 
stared back up at the ceiling for a moment. Then, turning her eyes to 
watch Makoto as she sat back down in the chair she had woke up in this 
morning, and putting some of her patented angry teacher voice into her 
comment, Ami said, &quot;You&#39;re a terrible liar, Makoto, and you were gone 
for nearly an hour.&quot;

Makoto had to stop and think for a moment. She didn&#39;t want to outright 
lie to Ami, but she didn&#39;t want to tell her the complete truth either. 
Looking down at Ami&#39;s face, Makoto sighed and said, &quot;We just talked for 
a bit about you. Mostly we established that we are both worried about 
you and have your best interests at heart.&quot; Then Makoto looked away for 
a few seconds before continuing.

Sounding like she was changing the subject, Makoto decided it was as 
good a time as any to get Hana&#39;s request out of the way. &quot;I think you 
should consider . . . quitting. I know whoever or whatever those people 
were we dealt with last night were not kind to you. I don&#39;t think anyone 
would blame you if you wanted to get away from all of it for a bit to 
clear your head.&quot; Makoto squeezed her eyes shut and flinched, as if she 
knew she were about to get hit as she thought to herself how bad that 
sounded to her. When no response came from Ami, Makoto opened one eye to 
look at the shorter woman.

Ami was sitting up in bed, sipping a cup of water and staring off into 
space. When she spoke, she was so quiet that Makoto almost hadn&#39;t 
noticed she said anything. &quot;I got caught off-guard pretty badly, didn&#39;t 
I?&quot; She took another sip of water, apparently deep in thought. It took 
Makoto a few more moments to realize Ami was very seriously considering 
it. &quot;You guys did pretty well when you rescued me, even if the whole 
thing was improvised. It&#39;s also the last thing our new adversaries would 
see coming since they would expect me to be making the strategies used 
against them in battle.&quot; After a pause, while Ami sipped some more 
water, she said, &quot;They came so close to breaking me, Makoto. They nearly 
had me believing the sky was purple if that was what it would have taken 
to get them to leave me alone.&quot;

Ami turned toward Makoto, saying, &quot;I&#39;ll never quit being a Senshi . . . 
but perhaps for the moment . . . it would be best to step back.&quot; Ami 
looked at the bed railing for a moment as she organized her thoughts. 
Once she had, she looked up at Makoto and said confidently, &quot;I have some 
things I need to work out on my own at the moment. I promise I won&#39;t 
leave you all hanging in a fight or something . . . but I think I need 
to step back . . . &quot; After she finished talking, Ami laid back down, 
looking up at the ceiling. Only when Makoto saw tears start to leave 
Ami&#39;s eyes did she realize how hard it was for Ami to say that. As if to 
end the argument that was silently being waged in her mind, Ami 
whispered to no one in particular, &quot;I&#39;m no use to anyone at the moment.&quot;

Makoto suddenly felt like she had personally delivered a killing blow to 
her friend. &quot;Look Ami, I take it back. I shouldn&#39;t even have -- &quot;

Makoto was silenced by Ami putting a finger to her lips. When Ami 
lowered her hand, she said, &quot;No, Makoto. You&#39;re right. They did a lot 
more to me than what you had the chance to see. They probably knew the 
physical wounds they inflicted on me would heal up relatively fast. 
Permanent physical damage wasn&#39;t their goal. It&#39;s the damage to my mind 
that will take time to heal.&quot; Closing her eyes tightly, Ami continued, 
&quot;I can still hear them, Mako-chan. Taunting me from the darkness of my 
own mind. Laughing at me, insulting me. They took my greatest strength 
as a Senshi and as a human being that I have and turned it against me. 
Don&#39;t get me wrong, the physical beatings they gave me were not easy to 
endure. But . . . well, for lack of a better word . . . what they did to 
me mentally . . . &quot;

Ami reached out and grabbed Makoto&#39;s hand suddenly, squeezing it as 
tightly as she could, trying to get some kind of security out of knowing 
she was with someone she could trust. &quot;They raped my mind, Makoto. I 
truly can&#39;t think of another way to word it. I don&#39;t think they realize 
just how close they were to breaking me down to nothing. They had the 
best interrogator in the world to do it too. Someone who thought almost 
exactly like I do, only a twisted version of myself.&quot; Ami gave out a 
shuddering gasp as the memories of her recent ordeal came back to her 
once more, suddenly and vividly. &quot;She reached into my mind and threw my 
most intimate, private thoughts out on the ground for all to see, like a 
careless child throwing toys out of a box. She could pick them up and 
play with them and flaunt them as if they were nothing special.&quot; Taking 
a breath, Ami said, &quot;Now that I&#39;m out of that nightmare, I find myself 
in a new one.&quot;

So quickly it scared Makoto, Ami jerked her hand away from hers and 
grabbed her own head for a moment with both hands, and curled up into a 
fetal position. Ami could almost feel her mind falling apart at the 
seams as memories came to her without her wanting to recall them, like 
books being violently and rapidly knocked off a shelf. She tried to 
scream as loud as she could, but hardly any sound came from her as all 
the calm she usually possessed had suddenly left her. She finally 
snapped, letting the rest of her thoughts spill out rapidly like 
precious water in the desert. &quot;She pulled thoughts out of my head 
whenever she wanted, hurt me with them and then tossed them back in my 
mind like they were garbage! I AM garbage! I&#39;m disgusting! Weak! 
Useless! A freak! I&#39;m -- &quot;

Her last words were stopped by Makoto, as she hugged Ami as tightly as 
she could. Ami was completely limp now, but she was sobbing like a baby 
into her friend&#39;s shoulder. Makoto could hear Ami&#39;s voice as she cried 
out between sobs, &quot;I can&#39;t make her stop! I can still hear her taunting 
me! I can&#39;t even get away from her in my sleep!&quot; Then Ami just cried 
over and over for a while, begging Makoto to, &quot;Make it stop!&quot;

All Makoto could do was hold Ami as tightly as she could and quietly 
tell Ami it would be OK every time her friend begged her to make it 
stop, even though Makoto had no idea how to make it OK. She wanted 
desperately for Ami to have never gone through whatever those monsters 
had done to her. She would have given anything to trade places, too. It 
was only until after Ami had cried herself to sleep that Makoto realized 
she had also been crying -- both from sadness for her friend and also 
out of anger and helplessness at not being able to do anything for her.

Makoto eventually gently let go of Ami as the petite woman slept, still 
occasionally whimpering and twitching a bit in her sleep from a 
nightmare Makoto suddenly wasn&#39;t sure she ever wanted to fully 
understand. It made Makoto want to wake the poor girl up again, but she 
knew it would do her no good at the moment. As Makoto dried her own 
tear-streaked face with a convenient box of Kleenex in the room, she 
thought to herself that she wanted to do more than just protect Ami. As 
she quietly walked out of the room and closed the door so Ami could 
rest, Makoto put into words in her mind what she wanted. She wanted to 
get revenge.
