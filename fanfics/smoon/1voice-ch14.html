<p>“And now, for my first trick, I’ll have Sailor Mars kill Nephrite’s guards over there.”</p>
<p>Nephrite crossed his arms over his chest and scolded his leader. “Stop kidding around, Kunzite.”</p>
<p>But  the crimson warrior was already striding across the stone courtyard  with deadly intent, raven hair tossed behind her by a sudden and angry  breeze.</p>
<p>“Call her off, Kunzite. This isn’t funny.”</p>
<p>The five  guards who protected the palace entrance turned towards the  representative of the Moon Kingdom. Their hands eased towards the hilts  of their swords and they exchanged curious glances at one another.</p>
<p>“They’re just common guards; it won’t be much of a loss.” Kunzite brushed it off easily.</p>
<p>Mars  met the first of the men to step forward. By the time he’d unsheathed  his sword, she’d already skirted behind him, placed soft palms on his  scratchy cheeks, and snapped his neck in one, swift, violent motion. He  hit the ground like a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p>With ashen faces, the  other four charged simultaneously. Mars ducked. One soldier ran down  another for her - unable to halt the forward momentum of his attack  without Mars’ body in the way to take the blow. His comrade pawed at  the spot where the blade impaled his abdomen. Mars was quick to snap  the neck of her intended attacker before kicking the other soldier’s  fallen sword off the ground and into her waiting hand with a precise  ease.</p>
<p>She leveled the weapon at the two remaining guards who  stood defensively - frozen and trapped by Mars’ empty, amethyst eyes.  She charged, and made short work of them, felling both with one blow  that opened both their necks effortlessly. Their blood left crimson  splatters on Mars’ cheek that she didn’t bother to wipe away.</p>
<p>Zoicite whistled softly. “Didn’t even use her sword or her powers on them.”</p>
<p>Kunzite nodded slowly. “The Venusian was right. She really <em>is</em> a barbarian.”</p>
<p>’<em>Venusian?’</em></p>
<p>The  Martian’s body froze. The world as she had grown to know it - dark  representations of her surroundings veiled in a thick, red haze -  faded. Instead of the cold and lifeless bodies on the ground before  her, she saw an image of the most beautiful blonde she’d ever seen.</p>
<p>And she felt at peace.</p>
<p>“Call her back.” Jadeite said uneasily.</p>
<p>“Fun’s over, Mars!”</p>
<p>The  image of the blonde was stripped away. The crimson warrior tossed the  dead guard’s sword to the ground where it landed with a clatter. She  slowly returned to the leaders of the Dark Kingdom.</p>
<p>Where she sat  under the shade of a generous elm, Queen Beryl crossed her legs and  pressed a finger to her chin. Why had Mars obeyed Kunzite’s command?  She was under no obligation to serve him. It struck her as strange from  this woman who had initially resisted Metallia’s control so diligently,  even in her unconscious state.</p>
<p>She smirked. Perhaps her  hypothesis was correct. Perhaps the Martian harbored her own inherent  darkness deep within her soul. Perhaps she <em>wanted</em> this.</p>
<p>Beryl,  however, would never know that as Mars came to stand next to her side  obediently, the crimson warrior had only one clear thought in her  clouded mind, even if she wasn't entirely aware of its meaning.</p>
<p>‘<em>Five less dark kingdom scum.’</em></p>
<hr />
The ice was too thin to step on.
<p>Of  all seven women assembled, none had found the courage to openly look  another in the eye. There had been sideways glances, darted gazes, and  fleeting looks, but there were still two unavoidable elephants in the  room.</p>
<p>Firstly, the change in their Princess had caught everyone  off guard. Serenity threaded idle fingers through one of her ponytails.  There was a chilling determination in her deep, blue eyes. She’d had  Endymion given to her, only to have him taken away again. It was cruel.  It was harsh. However, his disappearance also had the opposite effect.  She had not folded under pressure; in fact, she wanted to fight <em>harder</em>,  to win him back. She’d already asked her senshi for extra training and  was crestfallen to learn that she and her guardians were to be stuck in  a meeting for the next several hours.</p>
<p>Minako was a different  circumstance. The Venusian put up a brave front by masking her  bloodshot eyes and puffy cheeks with too much makeup, all while holding  her exhausted frame upright and stiff. She and Rei had had to fight for  everything they’d come to share. Nothing had been given to either of  them, and for her lover to be stolen away in the dark of night, from  her own bed, was a heavy blow that she still hadn’t reconciled with.  The others had never seen their leader become so unhinged. Only Rei had  ever had such an affect on her, and without Rei there to have caused  it, the effect was frightening.</p>
<p>Serenity and Minako were proof positive that people who are in love act strangely.</p>
<p>“Pluto?”  Serenity asked, unable to tolerate the uncomfortable silence any  longer. “I was unaware there was a senshi for the ninth planet.”</p>
<p>The  tall, sapphire haired woman nodded. “Did you not find it strange that  you hadn’t met the representatives of Pluto or Saturn?” She smiled  indulgently and inclined her head slightly. “I’m sorry that our first  meeting had to be under such circumstances, Princess.”</p>
<p>“Pluto has  been working with the outers for some time now, but let’s hold off on  the explanations until Rei and Endymion are here with us, ne?” The  others couldn’t bring themselves to meet Minako’s forced optimism.  “Besides,” Minako ruffled Serenity’s hair, “you don’t need more things  to worry about right now.”</p>
<p>Serenity nodded and clutched the  communicator Endymion had given her. It had been quiet ever since he  had been stolen from the Moon. But she had not given up hope.</p>
<p>Minako  turned to the herald of the Time Gates. With this stoic woman, who she  knew had seen more than all the other senshi combined, Minako could  allow her façade to slip in the slightest. She turned serious once  more. “If you’re here, then Saturn-“</p>
<p>“No. Saturn has not been awakened. Not yet.”</p>
<p>“Not <em>yet</em>?”</p>
<p>“I… don’t think we can hold off much longer.” Pluto paused and captured Minako’s gaze. “Tell me what happened here last night.”</p>
<p>Minako  looked to Makoto, and the Jovian fidgeted uncomfortably. “Mars,  Endymion and I…” Makoto began haltingly, finding no small amount of  interest in her hands where they rested in her lap, “we were all called  to the pole.”</p>
<p>“By Beryl?” Minako asked.</p>
<p>“No… I think it was  Metallia herself.” The Jovian suppressed a shiver. “When we got there,  we found the Earthlings setting up an access point. The youma were  already starting to stream through. Mars and I… we attacked. We were  going to try to collapse the access point, to stall for more time  against the Dark Kingdom, but…”</p>
<p>Ami laid a reassuring hand on  Makoto’s thigh, and the Jovian’s shaky voice continued. “Endymion  alerted us that Beryl would brainwash both Mars and I, and that’s when  she… that’s when she trapped me in her burning mandala.” Makoto  swallowed the lump in her throat. “She fought. She just kept <em>fighting</em>… but there were too many of them!”</p>
<p>Pluto stood. The Jovian had suffered enough. “And then they took Mars, but you escaped.”</p>
<p>Makoto  looked away, her lips a thin, white line. She was a warrior. It was a  soft spot. “She protected me, I think. Even after they brainwashed her,  I was still protected inside her shield. It wasn’t until she left  through the access point that the barrier faded. I… I wanted to stay  and fight the youma. I did. But I knew I needed to get back to the  palace to deliver the message…”</p>
<p>Minako rose and closed the  distance between herself and Makoto. She rested a hand on her senshi’s  shoulder. “You did what you had to do.” She said as bravely as possible.</p>
<p>The  leader of the senshi cracked an honest half smile then, for she could  hold onto that small hope that the Jovian had unwittingly given her,  that Mars had retained enough of herself to keep Jupiter safe, even  while being influenced by Metallia.</p>
<p>Minako slipped away from  Makoto and cracked her knuckles. “I think it’s safe to assume that the  Dark Kingdom plans to invade the Moon.” She could nearly feel the surge  of protectiveness and battle readiness from her warriors. She turned to  face them all coolly.</p>
<p>“What do you say we get the jump on them  and attack first? If we crush their access point on our pole, we’ll at  least buy ourselves more time against whatever it is Beryl’s planning.”</p>
<p>“Now  we’re speaking the same language.” Uranus pushed herself off the pillar  she’d been leaning against. It took only a few strides of her long legs  to close the distance that separated her from Minako and she grasped  the smaller woman’s shoulder and offered her a feral smile. “It’s the  best plan I’ve heard since we got here.”</p>
<hr />
The room she was in  seemed strangely familiar. She couldn’t quite put her finger on it, but  Mars was sure she’d been in the place before. She slowly walked its  perimeter. She poked her head into the expansive bathroom, paused by  the generous bed, and stared listlessly at the small koi pond from the  serenity of the wooden deck. She looked up. The Moon wasn’t out, but  Venus glowed brightly in dawn’s early light.
<p>She’d <em>definitely</em> been here before.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  Mars frowned. She turned on her heel and drew her sword, pointing it to  the room’s entrance. A half second later, the door swung open wildly. A  dark haired man stood panting in the opening. With a darted glance down  the hall, he stepped inside and closed the door behind him before  hurrying towards the crimson warrior. He seemed familiar, too, though  Mars couldn’t place him.</p>
<p>“Rei!”</p>
<p>’<em>Rei?’ </em>The Martian’s eye twitched. Her red tinged world wavered just the slightest.</p>
<p>The  Earthling rushed over to her side. Mars didn’t feel threatened by his  presence, and she lowered her sword before sheathing it once more.</p>
<p>“Listen,” he said insistently, “Beryl’s going to send you back to the Moon.”</p>
<p>’<em>The Moon?’</em></p>
<p>“I can’t imagine that Minako-san’s taking this any better than Serenity is right now.”</p>
<p>’<em>Minako?’</em> Mars raised a shaky hand to her temple. There was that vision of the blonde again. Why did that woman seem so <em>utterly</em> important?</p>
<p>“All  I can say is that I hope you’re being a damned good actress, Rei-san.”  The dark haired man reached into his cape. In his hand, he fingered a  finely folded piece of paper. “Mars, I don’t know what you have  planned, but my communicator is broken and I need you to give this to  Serenity-“</p>
<p>With a confused frown, Mars pushed the dark haired man  back with a sudden, violent shove. The Earthling stumbled and retracted  his hand back into his cape as though he’d been burned. He fingered the  piece of paper impotently.</p>
<p>The door to the room opened with a low-pitched squeal. A man with long, white hair scowled at what he found.</p>
<p>“Endymion.”  Kunzite spat. His boots quickened over the stone floor. His fingers  clasped around Mars’ arm. She yanked her arm from his grasp and leveled  narrowed, amethyst eyes at him.</p>
<p>Kunzite’s hands fell limply at his sides. He returned to the door. “Follow me.” He growled at her over his shoulder.</p>
<p>Mars afforded Endymion one short, critical glance before falling in behind the leader of the shittenou.</p>
<p>“Beryl  has a mission for you.” Kunzite said smartly, eyeing the crimson  warrior from the corner of his vision as he marched down the hall. He  liked her obedience, and he sneered with satisfaction. “I told you  you’d be on our side eventually.”</p>
<p>Mars frowned. Her pace slowed.  The blank darkness inside her mind gave way to a scream that sounded so  much like her own voice. It was disjointed, urgent, like something was  wrong. But she was so confused. So confused. She remembered the name  the man named Endymion had spoke, the name associated with the one  woman she could remember. It was all she could think of.</p>
<p>‘<em>Minako. Minako. Minako. Minako!’</em></p>
<p>Kunzite  laughed. He tossed a hand over his shoulder in a flippant gesture. “You  should have just chosen the easy way and surrendered when we had you  here on Earth. Now your little Venusian will be in a world of hurt.”</p>
<p>The  blankness disappeared from Mars eyes, the cloudiness giving way to  piercing amethyst. Her pupils dilated, and with the scream of metal  against metal as she drew her sword from its sheath, Mars leapt at the  shittenou, driving him back against the wall.</p>
<p>Kunzite found  himself in a position all too familiar, with the Martian’s blade  pressed against his throat. The crimson warrior applied just the  slightest amount of pressure, and he felt his skin give way to the  blade’s paper-thin edge, felt his hot blood coursing a trail down his  neck.</p>
<p>“That’s enough!”</p>
<p>Mars narrowed her eyes at Queen  Beryl’s voice. She gave Kunzite one last scathing look and pressed her  sword just a fraction of a centimeter closer before releasing the  pressure on his neck altogether. Holding his bleeding neck with a  gloved hand, Kunzite dropped to a knee in deference to his Queen.  Swiftly, Mars turned her back on him and sheathed her sword.</p>
<p>Beryl  walked around the crimson warrior in a close circle, eyeing her  critically. “Are you ready for your first mission, Sailor Mars?” The  Martian nodded. Beryl sneered. “I want you to go back to the Moon  Kingdom tonight. I want you to kill Venus.”</p>
<p>Rei’s eyes wavered;  the murky depths once again edged towards a violet hue and Beryl  frowned. The Queen flexed her will, and in one, short moment, they  clouded over once more.</p>
<p>“Yes, Queen Beryl.”</p>
<p>They were the first words the crimson warrior had spoken. Beryl smiled confidently and let her go.</p>
<hr />
Serenity was wearing a hole in her rug.
<p>Her  warriors had left hours ago, on a mission to the pole, and she’d been  forced to stay back with Pluto as her guard. She shot a weary glance to  the closed door of her chamber, knowing that that enigmatic woman was  just on the other side. Pluto was confusing. The woman seemed to speak  in riddles, and it was more than the distraught Princess could handle  at the moment.</p>
<p>She’d wanted to fight alongside her senshi, aide  them in battle, but her plea had been issued on deaf ears. Despite the  days of rigorous training she’s subjected herself to, her friends and  guardians had made her stay back while they went into battle.</p>
<p>And  she had to wonder if that what she’d always be to them - the helpless  Princes who needed their protection above all else. She couldn’t help  but wonder as her small hands balled into tight fists if they’d ever  take her seriously. Her fingernails pressed into her palms hard enough  to pull her back to reality, and her hand darted to the folds of her  dress.</p>
<p>She clutched the cool plastic contours of the communicator  Endymion had given her impotently, fighting to keep the tears that  threatened from spilling down her face.</p>
<p>She collapsed onto her bed, her fingers flying over the well memorized keys.</p>
<p>-Endymion, please respond-</p>
<p>Serenity’s  eyes were riveted to the chronometer on the wall. She’d force herself  to wait a full five minutes for a response. She was acutely aware that  in those five minutes, one of her senshi might be risking her life for  her sake.</p>
<p>-Endymion!-</p>
<p>Two more minutes passed. She couldn’t be so strong. Her fingers danced across the keypad once again. <em>Endymion</em> could be risking his life for her, and she’d never know.</p>
<p>-Please. I have to know you’re alright-</p>
<p>Fifteen  minutes passed. Small sniffles began to chip at the dam she’d so  carefully built. Watery blue eyes looked out her arching windows to the  glowing blue orb of the Earth, and with a single, hitching sob,  Serenity gave in to her despair.</p>
<hr />
“The humans aren’t here.”
<p>Venus growled. “Are you sure, Mercury?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely.”</p>
<p>“Then  the youma will just have to do for now.” Venus’ gloved hands made tight  fists. Slaughtering the youma hoard in the crater would only suffice  until she could get her hands on the ones that took Rei from her. But  at least it would be <em>something</em> to ease the pain. A cold, eerie wind howled restlessly.</p>
<p>“There are hundreds of times more youma now than when I left here last night.” Jupiter said darkly.</p>
<p>Uranus  nodded grimly. “We might make a dent, but we won’t be able to push them  back like we’d originally planned. There’s too many.”</p>
<p>“Mercury, if we can get in close enough, you can disable that access point, right?”</p>
<p>“Venus…” Mercury looked to her leader with a cautious eye, “we’d have to get <em>really</em> close.”</p>
<p>Cerulean eyes hardened. Fists clenched and unclenched.</p>
<p>“Venus?”</p>
<p>But  out and over the edge, the leader of the senshi was already lost to the  shadows of the crater’s wall, running down its vertical ledge  recklessly.</p>
<p>Uranus looked back to the others. “Keep an eye on  her.” She barked, and then she followed the Venusian headfirst into the  crater, feeling the others right behind her on her heels.</p>
<p>Elemental  attacks whizzed to the right and left of Venus. The ground rumbled at  her feet, and she felt Uranus at her left. A surge of ocean water  reared to her right and she knew Neptune was with her as well. The  familiar spark of electricity and a menacing spray of water that  tingled next to her were confirmation that Jupiter and Mercury were  right behind her. Yet Venus wanted to be the first to meet the youma  head on, and she appeased herself with a vicious swipe of her sword  that opened ones neck and sent him tumbling to the ground in a spray of  blood.</p>
<p>Slow and stupid, the monsters reared and sounded the  attack. Their cumbersome bodies ceased their aimless milling, and their  numbers slowly formed a more cohesive force, hundreds and hundreds of  the creatures forming lines and marching to meet the threat of the five  senshi.</p>
<p>Back to back, Neptune and Uranus launched long range  attacks in tandem, careful to aim close enough to the leader of the  inner senshi to reduce the number of youma in her immediate vicinity,  all while eliminating dozens of their numbers with each attack.</p>
<p>Despite  their massing numbers, the golden warrior only allowed herself to see  one enemy at a time. Focus, defend, attack, kill, smile, and press on.</p>
<p>Venus  only smirked when three youma surrounded her at once. They were a wall  of flesh and ooze, a mass of teeth and claws. Dwarfing her small form,  they were all she could see. One swiped at her with its short arms. She  sliced through the appendages with her sword before driving her weapon  into its throat. The other two seemed to learn and attacked together.  One met its fate with a crescent beam to the brain, the other received  the business end of her sword in the gut.</p>
<p>“Maa,” Neptune said between releasing long-range attacks, ”She’s getting a little cocky over there.”</p>
<p>“Let  her.” Uranus barked as two of the monsters got a little too close for  comfort. She rushed forward and tagged both of them through the neck  with her sword. “She won’t listen to reason now. Let her work off some  steam.”</p>
<p>With Jupiter as her cover, sending long-range bolts of  lightening into the fray before the first lines had even neared their  location, Mercury scrambled atop a rock formation. Gaining her feet,  her blue visor came to life before her eyes and she scanned the enemy  camp for their numbers and locations, their strengths and their  weaknesses.</p>
<p>“Not good.” She said hurriedly. “Even Uranus and Neptune’s attacks can’t possibly reach the access point from here.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”  Jupiter asked as she released another bolt of lightening. Ten youma  fell to the ground in charred heaps. Their brethren were only minimally  slowed as they clambered over their dead bodies. “Then we’ll just have  to get closer.”</p>
<p>“Through all those?” Mercury asked. Jupiter only  smiled up at her. With a knowing sigh, her blue visor disappeared.  Mercury launched her small body off her perch and she landed nimbly  next to her partner. Together, they rushed into battle.</p>
<p>A set of  claws razed Venus’ shoulder and she hit the frost-covered ground hard  enough to knock the wind out of her. From the corner of her eye, she  could see the two outers and her two inners fighting effectively as  teams. She was too slow to regain her feet, however, and she grimaced  as the foot of a youma pressed down against her back. She found she  very much missed fighting with Rei at her side. She coughed shallowly  as her air supply diminished. What she’d give to have that fiery,  confident reassurance next to her. The foot that pinned her down  flexed, producing long talons that shot into the tender flesh of her  side. Venus swallowed a strangled cry.</p>
<p>The ground beneath her  body rumbled. A vicious wind and a golden glow stole the air and pushed  her attacker off her prone body and cleared the general vicinity around  her. She was suddenly aware of Uranus pulling her to her feet. Venus  batted away the helping hands and found herself pushing her back  against the Uranian’s form, not wasting any time in summoning her love  me chain to attack four of the monsters that rushed in close to them.</p>
<p>From  where she’d fallen back to aide Mercury and Jupiter, Neptune sent a  Deep Submerge in her partner’s direction, taking out five more of the  youma that charged the two senshi leaders. Uranus and Venus leaned  against each other for support, each of them panting from their efforts.</p>
<p>“There’s no way we’ll make it to the access point, Venus.”</p>
<p>“What are you suggesting?”</p>
<p>“Fall back.”</p>
<p>The Uranian considered Venus’ small hesitation to be her approval.</p>
<p>“Never.” Venus’ raspy voice was nearly lost to the raging winds and the roar and constant shifting of the youma.</p>
<p>“Venus?” Uranus grabbed for the leader of the inner senshi.</p>
<p>But  it was too late. She was gone. Venus was a flash of golden light,  threading herself through the youma’s ranks. Her chain snaked out,  taking down bodies to her right, working in tandem with her sword that  dropped the youma to her left. Crescent beams felled the monsters that  stood before her.</p>
<p>But they just kept coming.</p>
<p>A World  Shaking cleared the path that had already closed in Venus’ wake and  Uranus charged in with one target in mind. She grabbed Venus by the  wrist. A Shabon Spray and an Oak Evolution kept the youma at bay for a  short moment.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” The Venusian barked.</p>
<p>“Calling a retreat. This is suicide.”</p>
<p>“If the outers want to retreat, that’s your decision.”</p>
<p>“I’m calling a retreat for the inners, too.”</p>
<p>“That’s not your decision to make, Haruka-san.”</p>
<p>“Have you even <em>looked</em> to your warriors, Minako?” Uranus barked, tightening her grip on Venus’  wrist. “They’re wounded and exhausted! They can’t keep this up and  neither can <em>you!</em>”</p>
<p>Venus reluctantly looked to her senshi,  barely visible through the shifting and scuffling of the monsters that  surrounded them. Jupiter held a bloodied arm closely to her body.  Favoring one of her legs, Mercury leant against the Jovian’s form, a  trickle of blood running from a gash across her forehead. Even Neptune  boasted battle wounds, a rapidly rising bruise above an eye and a cut  lip.</p>
<p>The Venusian looked to the leader of the outers, that  serious scowl compromised by a long, bloody gash that ran down an arm,  and a blackening bruise that circled one hazel eye.</p>
<p>“Don’t make me remove you forcibly.” Uranus warned. “This isn’t what <em>she</em> would have wanted.”</p>
<p>The  Venusian’s body went limp. She nodded her consent. Their comrades  cleared a path for their escape. Venus offered little protest as Uranus  pulled her back through the youma.</p>
<hr />
Sickbay had done its work,  bandaging the warriors of the Moon and sending them back to their rooms  to let their senshi powers complete their accelerated healing  processes. But it was only a small consolation to the leader of the  inners.
<p>“I can walk by myself.” Minako spat.</p>
<p>Haruka hefted the Venusian’s petite form in her arms easily. “Some thanks I get for helping you, you little brat.”</p>
<p>Minako  twisted her torso and slugged Haruka in the shoulder. Her weak punch  had little affect on the Uranian and succeeded in only tugging at the  stitches that lay beneath the Venusian’s bandaged side. She leant her  head against Haruka’s shoulder in defeat.</p>
<p>“Are you quite done  now?” Haruka asked scathingly. “That was some stunt you pulled out  there, risking yourself like that.” She looked down at the limp woman  in her arms. “You were no leader today, Venus.”</p>
<p>“’Ch.” Minako  spat the familiar curse, but it only served to remind her of her  missing partner, and she was forced to stifle a sob.</p>
<p>Haruka came  to a stop in front of Minako’s door and eased the body in her arms to  one side as she worked the doorknob. She strode towards the expansive  bed, not bothering with the luxuries of turning on the lights.</p>
<p>“Regardless  of what’s going on in your personal life, you can’t let it affect your  leadership. Too many lives hinge on your strength, Minako.”</p>
<p>Haruka deposited the Venusian on the bed none too gently. Minako refused to make eye contact with her.</p>
<p>“For  all you know, Rei is doing everything possible to get back here. You’d  throw that all away and sacrifice yourself in a reckless battle?”</p>
<p>The Uranian took the Venusian by the shoulders. “Look at me, damnit!”</p>
<p>Haruka  found herself regretting her words, for when Minako’s broken gaze  finally turned in her direction, she had no recourse to the haunted  pain she fond in the Venusian’s eyes. Haruka straightened stiffly and  returned to the doorway, but she looked back one last time. Minako only  stared at the ceiling blankly.</p>
<p>The Uranian frowned. ”I’m disappointed in you, Minako.”</p>
<p>Haruka shut the door behind her with a gentle click.</p>
<p>In  the darkness near the window, a pair of cloudy, amethyst eyes narrowed.  Her fingers possessed a white knuckled grip around the hilt of her  sword, pointed downwards so as not to catch the glint of the blue and  gold light of the Sun and the Earth that bled through the barely parted  curtains.</p>
<p>She stepped forward slowly, intent on her target, but  when one, retching sob seemed to unhinge the woman on the bed, filling  the room with inconsolable sobs, she paused.</p>
<p>“Rei!” Minako wailed, face down and pounding at her pillow, “Where <em>are</em> you?”</p>
<p>Battling  the haze that filled her mind, Mars hit the floor on one knee and one  hand gripped her head. What was this confusion? Why did she feel like  she was the cause of this woman’s pain? What was this sudden,  inconsolable <em>wrongness</em> that surrounded her?</p>
<p>Mars stood. Her sword clattered to the floor. The crimson warrior turned, and she threw herself out the window.</p>
<hr />
<p>Preview: Chapter 15: Home</p>
<p>Mars  paced between the walls of her room in Edo Castle. The heels of her  pumps tore ragged holes in the fine carpet that covered the polished  wood as she furiously turned her body time and again.</p>
<p>The woman in that bed, back on the Moon… why could she see her in <em>this</em> bed here on Earth, her naked body wrapped tightly around one that resembled her own? <em>Why</em>?</p>
<p>She was supposed to have killed that woman.</p>
<p>But she hadn’t.</p>
<p>She  stopped pacing. Her hands flexed, relaxed, and flexed again. Perhaps  she should seek out Endymion, that man who seemed to know her. Perhaps  he could-</p>
<p>Mars crumpled to the floor, hitting it with her knees  and rolling on her side into a fetal position as the hazy, crimson veil  that shrouded her vision flickered and faded to black. She felt icy  fingers surround her soul and squeeze tightly. She stifled a cry until  the pain receded.</p>
<p>Standing back up on shaking legs, the Martian  warrior wiped a cold sweat from her brow. Cloudy eyes hardened, and  with a newfound resolve, she left her room to resume her mission.</p>
