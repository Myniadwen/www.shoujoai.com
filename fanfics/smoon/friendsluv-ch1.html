&#147;&#133;&#148; is speaking

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako fell onto her bed with a loud sigh, &#147;Another weekend alone!! 
How boring!!! I need a boyfriend!!! How come no boy wants to go out 
with me, I mean come on who wouldn&#146;t want to go out with a beauty 
goddess like me? And how come Rei could get any boy she wants, but she 
hates men!! How is that fair!!!&#148; She rolled onto her stomach, &#147;Lucky 
Rei how I wish I was her!!&#148; The thought of Rei made her smile! &#145;Uh 
where did that come from&#146; She then sat up &#145;I know I&#146;ll go see Haruka 
she always cheers me up&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako knocked on the door of Haruka&#146;s house.

&#147;Minako! What are you doing here?&#148; Haruka asked as she opened the 
door.

&#147;Just came to chat, I hope you don&#146;t mind.&#148;

&#147;Naw it&#146;s fine, uh come in.&#148;

&#147;Thanks.&#148;

&#147;So what&#146;s bugging ya?&#148; Haruka asked sitting down on the black leather 
sofa. &#147;Boy trouble again?&#148;

&#147;How&#146;d you ever guess.&#148;

&#147;So what is it this time?&#148;

&#147;Nothing much except that I&#146;ve been turned down once again!! What&#146;s 
wrong with me Haruka?&#148;

&#147;Nothing Mina-chan!!&#148;

&#147;Then why won&#146;t anyone go out with me!!!&#148; Minako yelled.

&#147;Maybe someone does like you, and just hasn&#146;t been able to tell you. 
I&#146;m sure your true love is right around the corner.&#148;

&#147;Ya think so?&#148;

&#147;I know so!&#148; Haruka said with a devious smile. &#147;I&#146;m positive that 
you&#146;ll find true love very soon!&#148;

&#147;Thanks Haruka, you always know how to cheer me up!!&#148;

&#147;No sweat! Come back and tell me when true love finds you ok!&#148;

&#147;Alright! Bye Haruka and tell Michiru, Setsuna, and Hotaru I said hi&#148;

&#147;Ok I will, take care&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako walked down the street. &#145;I wonder if Haruka knows something I 
don&#146;t she sound so sure that I would find true love soon. No probably 
not it&#146;s probably just a coincidence. Oh well, I know I&#146;ll go see 
Rei!! Maybe we could go get ice cream or something.&#146;

&#147;Rei!!&#148; Minako yelled to her raven haired friend.

&#147;Minako?&#148; Rei called out looking up from her sweeping.

&#147;Hey Rei, do you want to go out&#133;for some ice cream?&#148;

&#147;Uh sure!&#148; Rei replied. &#145;Holy crap for a minute there I thought she 
was asking me out. What was I thinking Minako would never ask me out. 
Oh well.&#146;

&#147;Ok then let&#146;s go!&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#147;So what&#146;s bothering you?&#148; Rei asked as the two sat down in a booth at 
the ice cream parlor.

&#147;What do ya mean?&#148; Minako asked in total confusion.

&#147;Well every time something goes wrong, like a boy turns you down, you 
always ask me to go get ice cream with you.&#148; Rei replied simply.

&#147;I do? Wow, I never knew that, I guess it&#146;s just a habit.&#148; Minako 
replied. &#145;A habit that I&#146;d like to keep! What the&#133;where&#146;d that come 
from? Oh well.&#146;

&#147;So are you gonna tell me?&#148; Rei asked impatiently.

&#147;Just the usual. No boy on the face of the earth wants to date me!&#148; 

&#147;Aw Minako, that&#146;s not true, I know someone out there wants to date 
you!&#148;

&#147;Really who?&#148;

&#147;Uh&#133;you&#146;ll find out soon enough.&#148; Rei said nervously.

&#147;Come on Rei, tell me!! It would make my day! Please!!&#148; Minako begged.

&#147;Nope sorry!&#148; Rei replied firmly taking a bit of her hot fudge sundae.

&#147;Whatever! How bout you Rei have you finally given up the I hate men 
thing?&#148;

&#147;Nope!!&#148;

&#147;You&#146;re hopeless!! It&#146;s so unfair every boy on the face of the earth 
wants to date you and you could care less, and here I am wanting to 
fall in love and do I have any one? No!!&#148;

&#147;Poor little Mina-chan!&#148; Rei teased.

&#147;You got that right! Well hey I gotta get going! See ya &#145;round!&#148; 
Minako said getting up and walking out the door.

&#147;It won&#146;t be soon enough Mina-chan.&#148; Rei said to herself.

------------------------------------------------------------

Rei laid down on her bed. &#145;What&#146;s wrong with me! I&#146;m not suppose to 
fall in love with my best friend! I should be in love with some hott 
guy, but I&#146;m not! Ah how could I let myself fall in love with! It 
would be nice if she liked me back, but that&#146;s impossible. She&#146;s 
totally boy crazy! Haruka you&#146;re wrong there&#146;s no way that she could 
ever love me! No way! Damnit why am I crying! Get over it! There is no 
reason to cry, I mean its not like I really love her, its just a 
stupid crush! So why the fuck am I crying! Unless&#133;no that&#146;s 
impossible, or is it? Is it that I really do love her?&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

&#145;What a day! I&#146;m so glad to be home!! I think I&#146;m going to take a hot 
shower and then go to bed! Yeah that sounds good.&#146; Minako thought to 
herself.

Minako got out of the shower and slipped into her pajamas and crawled 
into her bed. Within minutes she was fast asleep.

~Dream~

&#147;Roses?&#148; Minako asked standing in a beautiful parlor of some fancy 
hotel. &#147;I wonder who they are from?&#148;

&#147;From your true love&#148;

&#147;Haruka? Who&#146;s my true love? Are they here?&#148;

&#147;Not yet Mina-chan, but they will be very soon.&#148;

&#147;Why are you here?&#148; Minako asked, but realized that no one was there. 
&#145;That sure is odd!&#146;

Minako walked around the large room, admiring every detail. She soon 
came upon a bunch of pictures, all of which were to blurry for her to 
make out. &#145;That&#146;s kinda weird. Who would frame blurry pictures.&#146; Her 
thoughts were interrupted by the sound of a door opening.

&#147;Rei? Why are you here?&#148;

&#147;Mina-chan you still don&#146;t get it do you? Do you like the roses?&#148;

&#147;Uh yeah, they&#146;re my favorites! But how&#146;d you know I got sent 
flowers?&#148;

&#147;Mina-chan are you that blonde? How on earth can you not know it&#146;s so 
obvious!&#148;

&#147;What are you talking about Rei?&#148;

&#147;Obviously I&#146;m just going to have to be blunt.&#148; Rei said a little bit 
irritated. And with saying that Rei kissed her softly. Minako a first 
stood in shock but then got into the kiss. Then she remembered who she 
was kissing and pulled away.

&#147;What the fuck was that about?&#148; Minako practically yelled.

&#147;Mina-chan are you that dumb! I did that because I love you!! That&#146;s 
what Haruka and I have been trying to tell you!&#148; Rei yelled.

&#147;You love me?&#148;

&#147;Yes!&#148;

~End Dream~

Minako sat up in shock. &#145;It was just a dream! That&#146;s all it was it&#146;s 
not like Rei really loves me! No, it was just some strange fucked up 
dream and nothing more! Ok, if that&#146;s all it was why am I still 
freaking out? Is it because it&#146;s true? No, that can&#146;t be right! I mean 
yeah Rei doesn&#146;t think highly of men, but that doesn&#146;t mean she&#146;s a 
lesbian. Right? I mean come on, Rei in love with me, Ha. I seriously 
doubt that! Maybe I should talk to her about it, but what if she gets 
mad at me for it? Oh I don&#146;t know!! I guess I&#146;ll just talk to her in 
the morning! Till then I need to get some sleep.&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

~Next morning~

&#147;Hey Rei!&#148; Minako said as cheerfully as she could.

&#147;Uh hi Mina-chan! What brings you here so early?&#148; Rei asked.

&#147;Um can we talk?&#148; Minako asked nervously.

&#147;Uh yeah sure.&#148; Rei replied reluctantly. &#145;I wonder what this is about, 
defiantly not a boy!&#146;

Minako sat down on Rei&#146;s bed, while Rei sat on the floor in front of 
Minako.

&#147;So&#133;what&#146;s this about?&#148; Rei asked half impatiently the other half 
dreading what she was about to hear.

&#147;Uh&#133;I had this dream last night.&#148;

&#147;Yeah so, I have dreams all the time.&#148;

&#147;It was about you.&#148;

&#147;Oh,&#148; Rei said sitting up a bit straighter. &#147;What about me?&#148;

&#147;Um&#133;well&#133;you told me that you um&#133;&#148;

&#147;I told you what?&#148;

&#147;You told me you&#133;loved me.&#148; Minako said so softly that is was almost a 
whisper.

&#147;Oh! Really,&#148; Was all that Rei could get to come out of her mouth.

&#147;And um&#133;I know this is gonna sound stupid, but I just have this weird 
feeling that um well&#133;do you?&#148;

Rei sat there in silence how on earth could she tell her, her best 
friend, that yes it was true. She was head over heels in love with the 
blonde sitting in front of her. No, she couldn&#146;t!! She wouldn&#146;t. For 
some reason she then heard Haruka&#146;s voice inside her head. &#147;You have 
to tell her! When the time comes you have to tell her. You can&#146;t keep 
all of your emotions inside of you!&#148; I guess this is the time. She 
took a deep breath and barely whispered one word and one word only, 
&#147;Yes&#148;

Minako sat in shock did she say yes? &#145;No! that was impossible, I must 
have heard wrong.&#146; But taking one look at her best friend&#146;s face 
proved her wrong.

&#147;I&#146;ll understand if you hate me, but just know I didn&#146;t choose to be 
this way.&#148; Rei said on the verge of tears.

&#147;Rei, I could never hate you!&#148; Was the only thing Minako could say. 

&#147;Minako, maybe you should leave.&#148; Rei said softly.

&#145;My gosh, she looks like she&#146;s about to break into a million pieces&#146; 
Minako thought. &#147;There&#146;s no way I&#146;m leaving you like this, Rei.&#148;

&#147;Please Mina-chan, just go.&#148;

&#147;But Rei&#133;&#148;

&#147;Get out!!&#148; Rei screamed.

Minako stood and looked at the raven-haired girl for a moment before 
leaving. &#145;What have I done? I need to talk to Haruka!&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

~Haruka&#146;s house~

&#147;Mina-chan, what&#146;s wrong?&#148; Haruka asked concerned. She had never seen 
the blonde so sad.

&#147;I know what you meant yesterday, and I wish I didn&#146;t.&#148; Minako said 
quietly.

&#147;What? What do you mean you know?&#148; Haruka asked confused and shocked 
all at once.

&#147;I know you meant Rei!!&#148; Minako yelled and then began to sob.

&#147;Mina-chan! What happened?&#148;

&#147;I had a dream about her, then I asked her about it and she hates 
me!!&#148; Minako sobbed.

&#147;Why does she hate you?&#148;

&#147;I don&#146;t know!!&#148;

&#147;Did she say she hated you?&#148;

&#147;No, but when someone screams at you to get out that it usually means 
they hate you.&#148;

&#147;No, it doesn&#146;t Mina-chan! She&#146;s embarrassed and upset. She wasn&#146;t 
prepared for you to call her on her feelings for you, she was shocked 
that&#146;s all.&#148; Haruka said soothingly.

&#147;Really?&#148;

&#147;Yes Mina-chan, really.&#148;

&#147;I need to talk to her!!&#148;

&#147;Before you go talk to her, you need to know how you feel about her.&#148;

&#147;What?!&#148; Minako asked in confusion.

&#147;She&#146;s gonna need to know if you care for her in that way or not. So 
you need to be able to tell her before you talk to her next.&#148; Haruka 
replied simply.

&#147;I guess you&#146;re right. Thanks Haruka.&#148;

------------------------------------------------------------

~Rei&#146;s house~

&#145;Why did I yell at her like that! It&#146;s not like she did anything 
except catch me completely off guard!! I mean it&#146;s not like she was 
screaming at me I hate you sick bastard! What the hell is wrong with 
me how on earth could I have been so fucking stupid!! Oh well, there&#146;s 
always tomorrow.&#146;

------------------------------------------------------------

~Minako&#146;s house~

&#145;Ok, how do I feel about Rei? Do I like her more than a friend? What 
kind of question is that of coarse I don&#146;t I&#146;m the most boy crazy girl 
out there! But then why do I have this weird butterfly-in-my-stomach 
feeling every time I think of her! Get real Minako you are not a 
lesbian!! Do you hear me not a lesbian!! You cannot like Rei Hino!! 
There is no possible way!! But then again what&#146;s so wrong with loving 
another woman? Why do I keep thinking like that! I can&#146;t like another 
woman and that&#146;s final!! Oh I don&#146;t know!! There&#146;s always tomorrow.

------------------------------------------------------------

~Next day, Rei&#146;s house~

&#147;Um hi Rei&#148; Minako asked cautiously afraid Rei would go off like she 
did yesterday.

&#147;Hey Minako, I&#146;m glad you&#146;re here. We need to talk.&#148; Rei said calmly.

&#147;Uh yeah!&#148; Minako replied with a smile that made Rei melt inside.

&#147;So um&#133;how are you?&#148;

&#147;Fine, I guess. Sorry bout yesterday I was just shocked that you um 
knew.

&#147;Yeah, I guess you were.&#148; Minako replied with another one of those 
smiles.

&#147;Um ok,&#148; Rei said taking a deep breath. &#147;Mina-chan, I want you to know 
no matter how you feel about me, I&#146;ll be ok. And also I don&#146;t want you 
to be afraid to talk to me any more, it&#146;s not like I&#146;ll try and get 
you completely drunk and rape you. It&#146;ll be the same old stuff except 
you&#146;ll know how I feel. Also, I need to know, do you feel the same? 
It&#146;s ok if you don&#146;t. I don&#146;t want you to say you do just to make me 
happy I want the truth.&#148;

&#147;Oh Rei!&#148; Minako sighed. &#145;How on earth can I tell her that I&#133;I know!&#146;

A huge grin crossed Minako&#146;s face. Rei could have sworn it went from 
ear to ear.

&#147;Minako?&#148; Rei asked wondering why Minako was smiling.

Minako didn&#146;t reply she just kept on smiling and walked over to Rei. 
Touching Rei&#146;s face she said, &#147;I&#146;m not real good with words, ya know, 
so I think I&#146;ll show you.&#148; She then leaned in and kissed Rei 
passionately. Rei was stunned but kissed back with as much intensity. 
She was totally shocked as she felt Minako slip her tongue into her 
mouth. They stayed like that for a while. In total bliss.

&#147;Wow!&#148; Rei said when they finally pulled apart. &#147;That was nice. 
Where&#146;d you learn to kiss like that?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s my little secret!&#148; Minako laughed.

&#147;So what now?&#148; Rei asked.

&#147;Let&#146;s let the world decide that. Let&#146;s just enjoy now, ok&#148; Minako 
replied.
