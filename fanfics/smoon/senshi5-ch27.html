<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 27 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><pre>Makoto pushed the doors open to the inner chambers,
the massive stone slabs moving along reluctantly. She
pressed, muscles on her arms showing like cords of
steel, then with a grinding sound they slid open to
reveal what lay within.

Without a word Usagi lead the way, Makoto, Rei,
Setsuna and Haruka following her as they strode
inside. Torches lit the walls, guards spaced out along
the edges of the chamber, a great throne sitting in
the center of the room. They walked on as the guards
hurried to circle the throne and the three figures
waiting there.

&quot;There she is,&quot; Usagi murmured, meeting the eyes of
her mother.

The two women looked almost eerily similar, Serenity&#39;s
silvery hair styled much like Usagi&#39;s blonde hair was,
the faces and forms basically alike. But while Usagi&#39;s
blue eyes ran the emotional range from gentle to
furious, the Oni queen&#39;s eyes were cold and lifeless.

&quot;How do you want to do this?&quot; Haruka asked,
electricity arching around the hands of the sandy
blonde haired woman.

Setsuna spoke up softly, &quot;I need to face Hotaru.&quot;

Makoto and Rei exchanged a silent glance then Rei
looked towards Usagi, &quot;You&#39;ll need someone to keep the
guards off your back when you face them.&quot;

A faint smile touched Usagi&#39;s lips as she nodded, &quot;I
guess so.&quot; She looked towards the throne and met
Mamoru&#39;s eyes, something dark passing between them,
then she looked to Haruka and asked, &quot;Can you take
him?&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s the one who betrayed you?&quot; Haruka asked
curiously, her eyes flashing. With Usagi&#39;s reluctant
nod Haruka smiled grimly, &quot;Then it&#39;ll be my pleasure.&quot;

Before anything else could be said the Queen rose from
her throne, her white gown swirling around her.
&quot;Welcome to my hall,&quot; Serenity said coldly, &quot;and to
what may be your deaths.&quot;

&quot;Or it may be yours,&quot; Setsuna said, meeting her former
lover&#39;s eyes, &quot;depending on what the fates will
decide.&quot;

&quot;The Oni have always decided our own fates, witch,&quot;
Mamoru said coldly, his red lined black cloak flowing
over the black armor he wore. At his side a long sword
hung, his eyes glowing faintly red in the dim light of
the cavern.

Serenity turned her gaze to meet her daughter&#39;s eyes,
&quot;I offer you a final chance to surrender and so doing
spare your friends&#39; lives.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Usagi answered crisply, then she gestured to
the others, &quot;Attack!&quot;

On cue Rei drew her bow, three arrows on the string
and let fly, dropping shafts with uncanny accuracy
into three of the guards as the others charged into
the breech. Drawing again she fired a arrow into
another guard as the first three burst into flame,
cries of alarm coming from the remaining Oni warriors.

Lightning danced around Haruka&#39;s fingers to form the
stormlord&#39;s saber, the blade crackling with power as
she raced towards Mamoru. He drew his sword, the
weapon a piece of shadow given form, sucking in light
like some kind of black hole. Their weapons met with a
silent clash of powers, the shockwave staggering any
nearby.

&quot;Die,&quot; the Oni lunged at Makoto but she dodged
smoothly. Before he knew it she had broke his nose,
then her next blow brought on inky blackness. As he
fell a arrow drilled into him, his body exploding into
flame.

Makoto&#39;s brown mane flowed as she spun, a kick
breaking the neck of another enemy with frightening
ease. &quot;You have no idea how good it feels to cut
loose,&quot; she growled. Makoto raised her voice
defiantly, &quot;Who&#39;s next?!&quot;

With ghostly silence Setsuna drew her knife, long
greenish black hair flowing like a banner as she raced
towards Hotaru. The black haired young woman had a
welcoming smile on her face, her polearm held ready
with it&#39;s darkly glowing runes. &quot;I will enjoy killing
you,&quot; Hotaru confessed, &quot;and consuming your
life-force.&quot;

The polearm swung down but Setsuna parried with the
dagger, the light pulsing around them both. &quot;You don&#39;t
have to do this,&quot; she offered gently, &quot;there could be
another way.&quot;

Hotaru reversed her weapon, slamming Setsuna across
the jaw, &quot;Fool, I embrace what the Oni have made of
me!&quot;

Knowing the others could handle themselves Usagi raced
through the crowd, only slowing once she neared the
throne itself. The sword slid free with a steely hiss,
then Usagi held her katana at the ready as she said,
&quot;Defend yourself.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m unarmed,&quot; the Queen spread her hands innocently.

&quot;Somehow I doubt that,&quot; Usagi said coldly , holding
her blade at the ready.

Touching the arm of her throne there was a soft click,
then a concealed sword sheath popped from the side.
Grabbing it Serenity charged, drawing the blade and
striking with incredible speed. The swords met with a
clang, Usagi staggered as much by the sense of
corruption from the other blade as by her mother&#39;s
strength.

&quot;This is the sister blade to your own katana,&quot;
Serenity said to her smugly, &quot;and is more than an
equal to you.&quot; Smoothly Serenity separated them then
launched a series of strokes with the green-glowing
blade that forced Usagi onto the defensive, driving
her backward.

&quot;No,&quot; Usagi braced herself, stopping her retreat and
facing her mother.

Serenity smiled mockingly, &quot;No?&quot;

Usagi rose confidently, her eyes shining as she stood
up straight. &quot;No,&quot; she repeated then continued, &quot;just
having a sword doesn&#39;t make you my equal.&quot;

Serenity faltered slightly, whatever she saw in
Usagi&#39;s eyes giving her pause, and seizing the moment
Usagi attacked. Instead of letting her anger control
her Usagi drew on her experience and training,
channeling her anger to strengthen her. Step by step
she drove the older, more capable swordswoman back
even as the light of her blade grew brighter and
brighter.

&quot;No,&quot; Mamoru&#39;s eyes widened in alarm, turning away
from Haruka and their battle as the queen visibly
faltered.

Before he could have a chance to recover Haruka
struck, her saber swept up, cutting him from the belly
straight up, lightning exploding around them. &quot;You
don&#39;t get to make that sort of mistake with me,&quot; she
said coldly.

&quot;Damn you....&quot; Mamoru managed before the world faded
to black.

As more guards burst into the room Makoto raced to
meet them, Rei&#39;s arrows arching up over her and into
them even as she struck. Blood, both Oni&#39;s and hers
stained the cloth binding her fists but she fought on
with grim intensity, determined to hold them back.

Hotaru panted softly, her glave moving in slow circles
as she studied Setsuna. &quot;You&#39;re good,&quot; she said, &quot;for
such a mystic.&quot;

&quot;As are you,&quot; Setsuna reached up to wipe some blood
from her cheek, then licked it off the back of her
hand. She seemed to disappear, moving with such speed
that she almost teleported in front of Hotaru. But
this time she didn&#39;t attack the girl, instead with a
quickly chanted spell she attacked the enchanted blade
of her weapon!

The bloody metal cracked, then shattered as it spewed
forth black energy, pure negative force that exploded
upwards into the cavern roof. A black miasma seemed to
lift from Hotaru as the broken weapon fell from her
grasp, clattering to the floor. Violet eyes wide with
shock and horror Hotaru gasped, &quot;What have I DONE?!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Serenity hissed, &quot;the binding spell is broken!&quot;

Taking advantage of her shock Usagi batted the Queen&#39;s
blade aside then struck, slicing across Serenity&#39;s
body in what was surely a fatal blow. Black blood
gushed down her body as she gazed down at the wound
then up at Usagi, mouth moving weakly... then she
died.

The ground heaved under the Senshi as the realm shook
wildly, stones rattling down from the ceiling. &quot;What
is...?&quot; Rei blurted.

&quot;The Queen was holding the Realm together,&quot; Usagi
quickly realized, &quot;and with her dying this place is
falling apart!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve got to go,&quot; Setsuna ordered, grabbing Hotaru in
her arms and leading the charge back to where they had
left the others.

Ami looked up in fear as they rounded the corner, then
smiled in relief as she cried, &quot;Makoto!&quot;

&quot;What are we, chopped liver?&quot; Haruka asked as she
hurried to Michiru&#39;s side, dodging another piece of
falling rock.

Raising her dagger Setsuna called, &quot;Usagi, your
sword!&quot;

Usagi drew her sword and crossed it over Setsuna&#39;s
blade as the other woman chanted, words rippling
across the chamber. The room buckled, rocks falling
and as a bright light grew around them all... the
cavern roof fell in with a loud crash.</pre>
