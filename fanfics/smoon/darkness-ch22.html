Outside of the vampires home, were thousands upon thousands of  vampires 
standing together, as well as some arriving. They stood in a semi-circle 
in front of Artemis and the gang, listening to him, as he spoke of the 
plans and details of what had happened a few hours before.

&quot;For centuries, we have been in hiding from the slayers. We&#39;ve watched 
as our loved ones were slaughtered by these monsters and this is going 
to stop, and I mean now. Those bastards had taken someone I really care 
about and they&#39;re going to pay for it. This is going to be a war to the 
fittest. We&#39;re not going to hide anymore, we&#39;re going to fight, a fight 
to the death. We&#39;re going to show them that we aren&#39;t going to take all 
of their crap anymore, and show that we should be respected!,&quot; exclaimed 
Artemis, with such emotion and passion.

The vampires shouted in approval and clapped, cheering him on. Artemis 
looked around and with determination and shouted, &quot;Let get this party 
started!,&quot;

*********

Serena looked at the woman in shock. She couldn&#39;t believe it, it was her 
mother, Long silver blonde hair, silver eyes, and older image of 
herself. &#39;How is this possible,&#39; thought Serena, the thought not 
registering in her mind.

Serena took a step forward, &quot;Mom?,&quot;

The woman turned around and the woman&#39;s eyes widened. The elder woman 
took a step closer to her daughter, &quot;Serena?,&quot;

Serena looked her mother up and down, &quot;I thought you were dead,&quot;

Her mother smiled, &quot;Well I&#39;m here sweetie,&quot; 

The woman took a step closer to Serena, reaching out her hand to touch 
her daughter. Serena slapped the hand away. 

&quot;No, I heard you scream!,&quot; shouted Serena, walking away from the woman. 
&quot;Me and my brothers heard you scream as we ran?we heard you die!&quot;

Serena&#39;s mother glared down at her daughter becoming angry, &quot;Well 
believe it kid, I&#39;m alive,&quot;

Serena shook her head, walking away from her. She turned to Darien 
angrily, &quot;You told me that you killed my mother and father because they 
meddled in your business,&quot;

Darien grinned, &quot;Well, I lied,&quot;

&quot;What the hell do you mean that you lied?,&quot; growled Serena. 

&quot;Well I lied about your mother meddling in my business,&quot; replied Darien. 
Serena looked at him oddly.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; said Serena.

Darien chuckled, &quot;The whole thing was a set up,&quot;

&quot;A set up?,&quot; whispered Serena.

Serena&#39;s mother laughed, &quot;Yes my dear, a major setup,&quot; 

&quot;How so?,&quot; asked Serena.

Darien walked casually over  to Serena&#39;s mother, &quot;Because little 
vampire, your mother is a slayer, and she was hired to kill your 
father,&quot;

*********

The vampires were moving rapidly, several flying, others running, as 
well as some driving. They were heading towards the slayers joint, 
getting pumped for their war. Ready to kick some major slayer butt. They 
were nearing the hide out quite quickly.

Adrenaline was pumping through their veins. The excitement getting to 
them. Many of them have been waiting for centuries for this day, and it 
has finally come. They began to slow down their pace to a stop.

They were there?

*********

Serena&#39;s eyes widened, &quot;What?,&quot;

Darien chuckled, &quot;The thing was, your mother was suppose to get close to 
your  father, and she did. Marring him, then having children. You see, 
the whole purpose was to get to your father and to kill him, and we 
succeeded,&quot;

Serena&#39;s mother laughed, &quot;The fool didn&#39;t even see it coming,&quot;

&quot;But why?, what did he do?,&quot; questioned Serena, eyes tearing up.

&quot;Because your father was the one that murdered my father!,&quot; exclaimed 
Darien. &quot;I&#39;ve been waiting for years for this plan to work, and it did. 
Then after his death,  a few years later, I hear that his daughter kills 
two of my best slayers.&quot;

Serena looked to the ground, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you kill my brother&#39;s and I 
that day, the day you killed my father?,&quot;

&quot;We had no use for you, we weren&#39;t planning on you surviving anyway, 
considering you were trained,&quot; replied Darien. 

&quot;You are strong kid, we should have captured you long ago. We could have 
corrupted you mind, making you one of us, if only I had foreseen what 
was to come,&quot; replied Darien.

Serena quickly turned to her mother with pleading eyes, &quot;Mom, this cant 
be true?tell me this is a lie,&quot;

The woman shook her head glaring at her daughter, &quot;Oh no child, this is 
indeed real,&quot;

A loud bang on the door disrupted the conversation, &quot;WHAT!?!?&quot; shouted 
Darien.

A young man entered, looking to be the age of 20, &quot;Sir, we&#39;re being 
attacked,&quot;

Darien looked at the man questioningly, &quot;What?,&quot;

&quot;The vampires, they&#39;re here, there&#39;s thousands of them, we need help!,&quot; 

Darien turned to see Serena&#39;s grinning face. He glared down at the girl 
and looked towards her mother, &quot;Lets go,&quot;

They both ran towards the young man, &quot;You keep a good watch on her, you 
got it?,&quot; replied Darien.

The young man nodded his head quickly, &quot;Yes sir,&quot; 

Darien smiled, &quot;Good,&quot; then he ran out with the woman.

The young man turned towards Serena and gulped. She gave him a sweet 
smile, &#39;This can be fun,&quot; she thought, cracking her knuckles.
