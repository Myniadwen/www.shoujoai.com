<h1>Plus de Compassion (More Than Sympathy) (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Je savais le silence depuis longtemps
J&#39;en sais la violence, son go&ucirc;t de sang
Rouge col&egrave;res, sombres douleurs
Je sais ces guerres, j&#39;en ai pas peur
Je sais me d&eacute;fendre, j&#39;ai bien appris
On est pas des tendres par ici
Je sais les hivers, je sais le froid
Mais la vie sans toi, je sais pas

(C&eacute;line Dion)

I knew silence for a long time
I know it&#39;s violence, it&#39;s taste of blood
Loud rage, silent pain
I know these wars, I am not afraid of them
I know how to defend myself, I learned it well 
People aren&#39;t very sensible here
I know the winter, I know the bitter cold
But life without you, I don&#39;t know.


Author&#39;s note:

It&#39;s my free translation from &gt;I don&#39;t know&lt;, because the French 
version is a little bit different and a little bit sadder (that&#39;s my 
opinion). To all those French people outside: I did my best with 
translation, I only had some years at school.

For all those people who read my first fanfics, don&#39;t be shocked, it&#39;s 
complete another story. It has nothing to do with the events that 
happened in the past during my last short stories. And it has another 
style. It isn&#39;t so funny because there&#39;re no Star Lights and hardly a 
Sailor Team who would make it funny.

Don&#39;t blame me for wrong details but I never lived with a handicapped 
person. Maybe it isn&#39;t so easy to find back into &gt;normal&lt; life again. 
Maybe it isn&#39;t so easy to face one&#39;s destiny. Maybe it takes much more 
time until you can laugh about yourself again. And maybe there&#39;s too 
often no hope of cure.

Normally I don&#39;t excuse myself for my writing but if I am hurting just 
one person out there on this wonderful world: I am really sorry. 
Gomen. I didn&#39;t mean it.

Epilogue: Life without you...

It stopped raining at dawn. Soon the raising sun broke soon through 
the dark clouds that had covered the sky for the last days. In the 
bright light the last raindrops started to sparkle and it looked as if 
nature was covered with shinning pearls. Fresh wind played with the 
coloured leaves of the trees. Some danced exited in the morning dust 
and the rushing was almost appeasing. Surely it was going to be one of 
those days why this months was sometimes called golden September. 

Silently she stood at the open window. The wind played with the wide 
dark shirt she was wearing over her blue jeans. She closed her eyes 
and tried to think of nothing. Sunglasses hide her eyes, a dark cap 
her short blonde hairs. 

This is going to be my last race.

She raised her hands and reached out for the chestnut tree that was 
standing in front of her window. She knew she couldn&#39;t touch the 
leaves after they cut the big branch that was once her lifeline. With 
the help of this tree she often escaped him. So many times she sat in 
the crown and looked at heaven above, feeling the wind rushing through 
the leaves around her. There she almost felt free and she wished that 
she could leave forever. She wanted to become the wind to be fast 
enough to escape forever.

Today I&#39;ll be able to.

Her face was motionless as she stood there for a while, the arm wide 
stretched to touch the tree that used to be her only friend for so 
many years. Her gesture looked like a goodbye wave.

&quot;Haruka? Breakfast!&quot;

She winced as she heard the loud voice downstairs. Actually she wasn&#39;t 
very hungry but she knew she had to eat anything because the racing 
could be exhausting. And she knew that he would force her to eat if 
she didn&#39;t. Slowly she turned around but the pain was faster. It 
flashed through her body and she winced again. Quietly she groaned and 
took a deep breathe. She knew this feelings. She was used to it. 

Carefully she went downstairs and entered a light and comfortable 
kitchen. Her muesli stood on the table while her father drank is 
coffee behind the newspapers. Haruka sighed silently as she sat down 
and forced herself to eat her breakfast.

At least the milk tastes fresh.

&quot;That&#39;s what they deserved!&quot; growled her father but Haruka didn&#39;t ask. 
She understood little of politics and she wasn&#39;t interested in the old 
men playing chefs but being at the same time still little children who 
are fighting for their favourite toys.

&quot;I hope you are prepared, Haruka. Because today is a very important 
race for your career.&quot; Said the huge man and laid down the newspaper. 
He ran a hand through is blonde hair and got up. &quot;I expect from you to 
break the track record this time. You can do it, I know it.&quot; He came 
over to her and she automatically ducked. &quot;Don&#39;t dare it to dishonour 
me again, Haruka!&quot; Then he left the kitchen and the girl lowered her 
head and pushed her breakfast aside.

&quot;Hai.&quot; She whispered with a low voice and took the newspapers to think 
of anything else.

Today I won&#39;t dishonour you. Today I will break the track record. And 
then I will leave you and this bloody life forever!

Silently she read the news and the temperature for the next days. It 
was going to be a lovely September. That was good, because the summer 
had been cold and wet.

Why do I care for the weather?

She closed the newspaper and froze in motion as she read the headline: 
Famous musician and his family involved in a deadly car accident.

&quot;Goddess...&quot; she whispered as she looked at the picture below. The 
silver Ferrari that used to be the realisation of a dream was not more 
than a small quarter of metal and sheet metal. A red fluid covered the 
asphalt of the street below and Haruka was sure that it was blood. No, 
no one could survive such a terrible accident.

What happened?

&quot;The cause isn&#39;t found yet. The best piano player of Japan died at the 
place of accident. His wife fought long but she died at the way to the 
hospital. Their daughter lays in hospital. She is unconscious and the 
doctors don&#39;t see a chance that she will awake again. What a 
tragedy...&quot; read Haruka aloud and didn&#39;t even mention that her voice 
was very shaky with a sudden. Her hands who hold the paper trembled 
and she felt trapped with all a sudden. She couldn&#39;t breathe anymore 
and nausea filled her belly and increased.

What a tragedy!

She read the article once more as if it would change. But it didn&#39;t. 

What a tragedy...

Haruka rose from her chair and it crashed the floor as she spun around 
and run upstairs as if bloodhounds haunted her. She ignored the 
shouting of her father and entered her bathroom. She locked the door 
and went into her knees beside the toilette. Then she threw up her 
breakfast. She kneeled there for a long time and couldn&#39;t fight back a 
sob.

She isn&#39;t dead. Maybe she&#39;ll survive it.

Very slowly Haruka came back to her feet and reeled over to the 
washbasin to cool her hands and her sweaty face.

Surely she&#39;ll survive it. She&#39;s the strongest human I&#39;ve ever met.

Haruka shook her head then she entered her room again. Her rucksack 
was already packed with her lunch, her racing suit and her English 
book. She&#39;d write a test the next day and her father expected only 
good marks. And English wasn&#39;t her favourite lesson. Her French was 
even worse.

Why should I learn all these silly languages when all I should do is 
racing the motorbike and full filling his dreams? Not my own ones...

Determined she threw the book and her lunch under her bed and took an 
old photo album and her worn-out teddy bear in it. She looked around 
her room and her Walkman and a black pullover followed. Sadly she 
observed the rucksack.

Strange, that&#39;s all what I own. That&#39;s all what would remember the 
world that I lived. Fifteen long years. And all I would leave are a 
teddy and some photos.

She ignored the cupboards being filled with trophies. She didn&#39;t need 
them. Not really. They couldn&#39;t full fill her dream. Hai, on her 
Suzuki she was very fast. There she could almost feel free. There she 
wasn&#39;t only as fast as the wind. There she was the wild element. 
Actually she didn&#39;t want to win. She simply wanted to escape. To go to 
a place where no one would ever hurt her again.

&quot;Haruka! We have to leave now!&quot;

The girl nodded and left her room without looking back. She knew that 
she would never return again and she didn&#39;t regret it.

She thought at the headlines of the newspaper and knew that she would 
break every record today just to let this race be over as quickly as 
possible.

Please live! If not for yourself or your music, then live for me. 
Because I need you.

Haruka was almost shocked as she felt the tears burning in her eyes. 
She hadn&#39;t cried the last two years and she hardly ever cried before.

&quot;Haruka! Hurry up!&quot;

&quot;Hai!&quot; The girl ran downstairs and joined her father to go over to the 
big red car he was driving. Silently she sat down and reached 
automatically for the belt. Her father switched on the radio and 
Haruka made a face as she heard the famous love song they played a lot 
at the last time.

&quot;You&#39;ll break the track record and make me honour, won&#39;t you?&quot; asked 
her father as they left the drive and headed towards the highway. 

&quot;Hai.&quot; Whispered Haruka and looked out of the window and watched the 
world flying by.

&quot;That&#39;s my good boy.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes grew wide behind her sunglasses but she didn&#39;t say a 
word. She just pressed her lips together and automatically crossed her 
arms before her chest. It was an almost protectively gesture.

&gt; That&#39;s what they deserved! &lt; she heard again the voice of her father 
in her head and clenched her fists under her arms. 

I hate you!

But she knew that she would never say it aloud. Maybe he knew about 
her feelings. Maybe he didn&#39;t. Probably he simply didn&#39;t care. As long 
as she full filled his dreams how he wanted it everything was alright 
for him. Haruka shivered slightly although it was very warm in the 
car. She knew too well what happened when she couldn&#39;t full fill his 
expectations.

Perhaps it isn&#39;t going to be my last race.

The girl leaned her head against the seat and closed her eyes.

But surely it&#39;s the last time that he will ever see me!

***

&quot;Exited?&quot; 

Haruka didn&#39;t even look up as the old mechanic entered the box. She 
already wore her racing suit and now she tried to repair her motorbike 
as fast as possible. Dirt and oil covered her arms as she worked with 
the spanner.

&quot;What are you doing? I watched it yesterday and it was okay. Did I 
oversee anything?&quot; Now the voice of the old man was very concerned. He 
came nearer and looked over her shoulder.

&quot;The brake hose is cut?&quot; he whispered and observed with his dark eyes 
the kneeling girl in front of him. &quot;But that wasn&#39;t yesterday when I 
checked it. I swear.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell father.&quot; Was all Haruka replied as she finished her work 
and cleaned her hands on an old towel. A shocked expression appeared 
on the old man&#39;s face.

&quot;You&#39;re still wearing your sunglasses? How can you see anything? It&#39;s 
very dark in here.&quot; He reached for her but Haruka was too quick. She 
jumped back and took her helmet in her hands. &quot;Is that cool?&quot; asked 
the old man then he shook his head. He knew little about the young 
generation but he knew that it wasn&#39;t fashion that forced the girl to 
wear her cap and her sunglasses almost always. 

&quot;Without a break you&#39;d be able to get to the start but the first bent 
is too dangerous to...&quot; The old mechanic whispered as Haruka pulled 
her helmet over her head. The sunglasses and the cap went into her 
rucksack. Then she put it on her back. It had the same colour as her 
racing suit and was covered with advertising. When they got to know 
it, it was too late to call her back. Carefully she took the heavy 
motorbike and slowly left the box. The old mechanic followed her and 
held her back. His dark eyes looked really concerned down at her.

&quot;Why did you change your opinion with all a sudden?&quot; he asked with a 
shaky voice. Haruka sighed slightly but she understood him. He was 
there since she started racing. For his possibilities he cared for 
her. Sometimes he protected her from the rude opponents who didn&#39;t 
want to loose against a boy much younger than they. The old mechanic 
was kind of a father to her. Or the grandfather she never had.

&quot;There&#39;s still someone out there who needs me.&quot; She declared quietly 
and entered the bright sunshine on the track.

There&#39;s still someone out there who wants me.

***

She raced like a devil. No one could hinder her. No one could detain 
her. The track seemed to be too long for her and it took her too much 
time until she reached the start again. So she speeded up and every 
bent was a new adventure if the Suzuki would make it or not. At the 
tenth round she broke the track record. She broke it with a time her 
father always dreamed of. Surely it would take another long time until 
it would be broken again. But she didn&#39;t care about it. She just drove 
like crazy and lapped the last drivers. The audience yelled and the 
commentator talked the whole time exited. They&#39;d never seen anything 
like that before in their whole life.

Please, stay alive!

Please, god, let her live!

It was the first time that she prayed. She never really believed in 
god because she was convinced that there was no higher power above. 
Otherwise he certainly had a lot of fun to watch her life and make it 
worse with every bloody day!

But now she prayed with all her heart. If there was such a power he 
should watch over her. The daughter of the piano player never did 
anything wrong. She was the sunshine of her parents.

She&#39;s the light in my darkness.

Minutes seemed to last like hours and it seemed to last eternity until 
she reached the goal. The second racer would arrive two minutes later 
and she knew that she had driven the race of her life. The audience 
yelled and it was her honour to drive another lap to enjoy her victory 
until she had to go to the box again. But this time she didn&#39;t even 
think about this honour. Instead of becoming slower she even speeded 
up.

&quot;What the hell are you doing?&quot; she heard her father in the micro she 
wore in her ear. She reached for the cable and ripped it. The angry 
voice died away and she concentrated on the exit. It was the exit for 
normal people but she knew that she couldn&#39;t escape on a different 
way. The audience seemed to feel it and the people stepped aside. She 
bowed over her handlebars and ignored the pain that went through her 
body. The audience yelled as she left the track and drove through the 
mass, through the exit and on the street behind the arena. Her wheels 
squealed on the hot asphalt and some cars had to break as she crossed 
the street and turned around to take the direct way to the highway. 
She knew where the piano player moved with his family two years ago. 
And she believed to know in which hospital his daughter laid and 
fought with her life.

Don&#39;t loose this fight!

Her birthplace was several hundred miles away from the hospital but 
Haruka was trained well. She speeded up on the highway and she knew 
that she would reach the big city in about an hour or less. And she 
knew that her father would never be able to find her in that city.

He will never force me again!

The wind played with her racing suit as she speeded up until she 
reached her limit. She didn&#39;t hesitate and crossed it. The highway 
made a bent and behind it she could see the wide ocean. She had to 
train too much and so she was hardly be able to watch nature&#39;s beauty. 
The surface shimmered like silver in the bright sun. Steady waves 
crushed at the beach and somewhere behind the horizon sky and sea 
seemed to become one.

Strange, I never had a place to go.

But now she felt as if she was coming home.

***

&quot;It&#39;s such a pity.&quot; Declared the nurse to her colleague and thanked 
for the warm coffee. It was evening and there was little to do. The 
patients slept and the operations were over. Now they had to watch 
over the ill people to make sure that they&#39;d experience the next day. 
This was the intensive care unit. The two nurses had seen a lot of  
sorrow in their lives but times by times even they were really 
shocked.

&quot;Hai, she&#39;s so young. Only fourteen. And so talented. The newspapers 
said that she learned the clarinet...&quot; 

&quot;No, it was a violin.&quot; 

&quot;Right, the violin since she&#39;s four years old and strong enough to 
hold it. She gave her first concerts with eight and she&#39;s very known. 
Almost as known as her father in the music world of Japan.&quot; The first 
nurse sighed and drank a bit of her hot coffee.

&quot;She&#39;s just too young for this destiny.&quot; Declared the second nurse and 
took sugar in her coffee.

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s karma that she won&#39;t survive.&quot;

&quot;Is it so sure?&quot;

&quot;The doctor looked at her with that look on his face this morning. You 
know that look that makes your heart break.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

Silence evolved between them and they sighed again.

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s better that she&#39;ll die. After all what will she have from 
her life?&quot; asked the first nurse very silently.

&quot;But she&#39;s so young. She has so much time left, so much to experience. 
So much to learn.&quot;

&quot;The doctor isn&#39;t sure if she has any brain damages. Maybe she&#39;s deaf 
or blind if she&#39;ll awake again. Or she&#39;ll be mental handicapped. Then 
she&#39;ll be a person in need of care the rest for her life. A dead 
spirit trapped in a still living body.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s such a pity. She&#39;s such a beautiful girl. And so young! It&#39;s 
said she won a lot of prices with her music and with swimming. She 
must be a very good swimmer.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s over now for sure. Even if she awakes and even if her brain is 
okay she&#39;ll never be able to walk again. Her legs are broken and the 
doctor supposes that her backbone got a bad damage.&quot;

&quot;But she could live a normal life! Even if she has to use a 
wheelchair, she would still be able to play her music, to fall in 
love, to finish school and to get married one day. Her parents were 
very rich and she&#39;d inherit enough to make her life worth living. She 
can even drive a car when she uses the helps of special apparatuses!&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s unconscious and the doctor don&#39;t think that she will awake 
again. She&#39;s almost dead and we can&#39;t help her anymore. It&#39;s her will 
to survive now. Maybe she already knows that her parents are dead and 
she doesn&#39;t want to awake anymore. The newspapers wrote that she loved 
her parents very much and her parents loved her in return. She has no 
grandparents and no other relatives. Maybe it&#39;s better to die after a 
short but happy life than to live a long but very lonely one. After 
all there&#39;s no one who would take care for her.&quot; The nurse sighed and 
shrugged her shoulders. &quot;And even if she&#39;s rich it&#39;s still very hard 
to find a person who wants to live the rest of his life with a 
handicapped person. She would learn a lot again but there are things 
she would need help for forever. Believe me, it&#39;s hard to find such a 
person. My nephew lost a leg because of an accident and it&#39;s very hard 
for him at school. A lot of students deride him and no girl wants to 
go out with him.&quot;

&quot;But she&#39;s so young!&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot;

Again silence evolved between them and quietly they drank their 
coffee.

&quot;It&#39;s such a pity.&quot;

***

Haruka took a deep breathe then she averted from the two nurses. She 
wore her normal clothes again and the sunglasses although she could 
hardly see anything in the dark corridor. The motorbike stood in the 
parking space hidden in the shadows of huge trees.

Silently the girl crept through the hospital. Her heart beat violently 
inside her chest and she could hardly think a clear thought. Her mind 
was dizzy and the whole world begun to spun around her as she heard 
the cruel words of the nurses again and again in her head.

She mustn&#39;t die!

Haruka sneaked into the room and froze in motion by the door. There in 
the middle of the room in a bed laid a girl under white blankets. Her 
sea green hair that once shimmered in the bright sun was now matt. The 
face was covered with bruises and the once so red cheeks were pale. 
Deep shadows laid under her once so shinning eyes. No smile laid on 
the now almost white lips. Motionless the girl laid there, just her 
chest moved with the regular noises of the machines that hold her body 
back from dying. Hoses were connected to her mouth, her neck and her 
arms. Two drips were connected to her left wrist. The legs were in 
plastercasts.

She looks so fragile.

Haruka swallowed hard and didn&#39;t even mention that tears were running 
down her cheeks. Tears she never felt during the last two years when 
she went through hell.

When I thought I knew what hell was. Now I see what real hell is.

She closed the door and came slowly over to the bed. The steady noises 
of the machines were driving her crazy but she calmed herself down and 
forced herself to sit down on the chair beside the bed.

&quot;You mustn&#39;t die.&quot; Declared the girl with a shaky voice and more tears 
ran down her cheeks. Carefully she touched the right hand of the pale 
patient who brought a little happiness in her painful life. For only 
some weeks. But these weeks had been the best in all those terrible 
fifteen years. Those weeks had been worth living this nightmare. 

&quot;Can you hear me?&quot; whispered Haruka and caressed tenderly the pale 
cheeks and the matt hairs. Once she had touched them, too. But two 
blue eyes had shone up to her and a loving smile had touched her heart 
two years ago. Once she had embraced the pale girl and felt her arms 
around herself as well. And just for once she had kissed her. It was 
the gentlest touch she&#39;d ever experienced and sometimes she thought 
that she was born just for this moment that lasted for eternity. And 
that was so fast over as if it didn&#39;t happen at all.

But it changed my life forever.

&quot;I know you&#39;re not gone.&quot; Haruka wasn&#39;t good at words. She never knew 
what to say best and so she often kept silent. When her father argued 
with her she knew that it was better to keep silent. Also in other 
situations it was too hard for to explain her feelings. But now the 
words were just pouring out of her mouth.

&quot;You can&#39;t be gone! Remember what we promised each other at that time! 
We promised to go to the same school so that we can be together 
without him interfering in our world. We promised to be together for 
the rest of our lives. You wanted to go on tour with your violin and I 
wanted to join you with my piano play. Even your dad said that I am 
very good at it. You can&#39;t forget those weeks then! You can&#39;t forget 
all those words we&#39;ve said. You can&#39;t...&quot; Haruka sobbed and with a 
sudden she wasn&#39;t ashamed of it. &quot;You&#39;re all I&#39;ve got, Michi-chan. 
You&#39;re the one who keeps me going on. You&#39;re the only reason for me 
being alive. What shall I do without you? You&#39;re the ray of hope in my 
dark life. You can&#39;t just go like that. There is too much to do for 
you. You&#39;re so talented! The people need your music! They need you 
being part of their society. You always wanted to go to high school. 
To become a real musician. To see the world. You always wanted to 
visit Europe and America. That&#39;s all possible. Just stay alive. Just 
awake again. Please!&quot;

It was the second time in her whole life that Haruka pleaded for 
anything. 

&quot;Don&#39;t go, Michi-chan. I need you.&quot; She whispered and held the 
lifeless hand on her now wet cheeks. Warm tears ran down the icy 
fingers.

&quot;Please, come back to me! I need you so much! Please, Michi-chan!&quot; As 
the pale girl didn&#39;t react Haruka lowered her head and sobbed 
helplessly.

She heard the shaky voice somewhere in the dark. She was here for such 
a long time that she thought it was right so. That she belonged in the 
dark. It seemed to be right to stay here forever. A feeling said her 
that there were other people in the dark who wanted her to stay. Then 
there was a bright light and she headed towards it. She saw two 
figures standing in it.

&quot;Mom! Dad!&quot; she screamed and wanted to run towards them. But at that 
moment she heard the shaky voice. She blinked and turned around. But 
there was only darkness. Her parents were still standing in the light, 
reaching her hands out for her to take her with them home. But the 
shaky voice told her something different. She knew this voice. There 
had been a time when she listened to it for hours. She liked it to 
listen to it. Slightly she remembered someone smiling down at her. 
Suddenly she felt wind playing with her sea green hairs and she heard 
the rushes of the wide ocean. She had been there with that person. And 
she loved it. She remembered the sun shinning on her skin and the soft 
violin music she loved so much.

&quot;Please come back to me! I need you so much! Please, Michi-chan!&quot; she 
had never heard this voice so desperate. Normally it was full of fun 
and joy. 

But only in my presence.

Michiru took a last long look at her parents and waved her trembling 
hand. Her parents waved back with a smile on their faces. Then they 
turned around and vanished together with the bright light.

It took all her powers to open her eyes. It was dark in the room and 
she almost fainted as the pain flashed through her body. Her legs hurt 
so much she wanted to scream. But she had no powers to. She heard the 
steady noises of machines and she saw the hoses connected to her body. 
Fresh air was pushed in her mouth and blood was pushed in her veins. 
Her body seemed to burn and she wished herself a great aspirin.

The sobbing was louder than the machines. Michiru wanted to scream as 
she slowly turned her head but she couldn&#39;t. The hoses in her neck and 
her mouth suffocated every try. She saw the girl sitting next to her 
bed, holding her hand against her cheek. Michiru could feel the hot 
tears on her cold skin and it prickled. Sunglasses laid on the white 
blanket and the strands of the blonde hairs that weren&#39;t hidden by the 
dark cap covered her eyes with shadows.

&quot;...&quot; Michiru rolled her eyes as her voice didn&#39;t obey her. She took 
all her powers and managed to speak a single word: &quot;Ruka?&quot;

The girl raised her head and Michiru would have gasped if she had been 
able to. The face was covered with bruises and the eyes were blue and 
swollen. Tears were running down the cheeks. Meeting no resistance.

He&#39;s still beating her.

With the rest of her powers Michiru managed to stroke over the bruises 
that were normally hidden by sunglasses and the shadows of the cape.

&quot;Michi-chan?&quot; Hope returned into deep green eyes that had stared so 
desperate some seconds ago. So empty. So all alone.

The pale girl smiled a small smile but it was the most beautiful smile 
Haruka had ever seen.

&quot;You&#39;re driving me crazy, Michi-chan. I&#39;ve almost thought...&quot; her 
voice broke again and a sob escaped her throat. The still cool hand 
squeezed her own one lightly as if she wanted to show her that she was 
alright. That she wouldn&#39;t die. That she would never go in her own 
world leaving her behind.

Tears were burning in Michiru&#39;s eyes as well and she didn&#39;t know how 
she should handle the pain that filled her body, her whole life.

&quot;Better I&#39;ll call the doctor.&quot; Said Haruka and wiped away the tears 
from her cheeks as if she was suddenly ashamed of it. Then she took 
her sunglasses again. Michiru&#39;s hand tried desperately to hold her 
back and panic grew in her pale face.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Michi-chan. I&#39;ll never leave you. I promise.&quot;

Dark green eyes looked for some moments deep into tired blue ones.

Haruka made hardly any promise. Because she hold it with all 
consequences. Michiru knew that. She let her go and smiled a painful 
smile towards the now opened door. She heard how the girl ran along 
the corridors screaming for a doctor not caring about the other 
patients she would wake up.

Maybe there&#39;s still hope.

Michiru closed her eyes and prepared herself for the words of the 
doctor. 

Definite words.
