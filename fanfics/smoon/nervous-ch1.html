<h1>Nervous</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<p>It was only a concert. She'd been to more than a few concerts with Hotaru before. 
Concerts, 
movies, museums, the theater, the park...she'd never been nervous before. What was there to 
be nervous about?
 
<p>"But that was when we were just friends," ChibiUsa sighed, glaring at her reflection in 
the 
mirror. "Ugh, Hotaru's seen this dress on me a million times, it's no good!" she wailed, 
whipping it over her head. Her hair still wasn't styled, Hotaru would be there to pick her 
up in fifteen minutes and she'd tried on everything in her closet.
 
<p>She thought it would be easy making the transition from friends to girlfriends. It was as 
if 
she and Hotaru were meant to be together, almost. <i>It was fate that we met.</i> And she 
knew Hotaru didn't care a whit about fashion or appearance.
 
<p>"But <i>I</i> want to look pretty for her," ChibiUsa sighed, trying a white skirt and 
pink 
sweater combination. "No, no, no! White shows dirt easily, and this fabric is nearly 
transparent!"
 
<p>She glanced at the clock and wailed with frustration. She'd never be ready on time at 
this 
rate.
 
<p>*
 
<p>At exactly seven fifty-nine, she met Hotaru outside, finally satisfied with a lavender 
skirt 
and dusty rose sweater. But in the end she couldn't be bothered with her hair and simply 
pinned the ends back with simple white clips.
 
<p>"I hope I'm not late." Hotaru stood on the front step, wearing lavender silk trimmed with 
black lace and pearls. "I couldn't decide what to wear," she said. "You look beautiful 
tonight, though, ChibiUsa."
 
<p>"Ah..." ChibiUsa laughed. "I wanted to look good for tonight, after all...but it's silly 
of 
me, to be so nervous."
 
<p>"I'm nervous, too," Hotaru confessed. "But...it's better to be nervous together, than 
alone."
 
<p>Suddenly, they both laughed. It was silly, really, a change in the relationship didn't 
change who they always were.
 
<p><i>Still, you can't fault a girl in love for wanting to look her best,</i> ChibiUsa 
thought 
as they settled into the backseat of Haruka's car.
