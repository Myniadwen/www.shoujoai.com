<h1>I'm a Woman Now!</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/steelshikoku.html">Steel Flint and Shikoku</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;Do I have to do this?&quot;

&quot;Yes, you do. I made dinner; Setsuna is doing the dishes, so YOU have to 
read the bedtime story.&quot; Michiru firmly informed her lover, crossing her 
arms over her voluptuous bosom.

&quot;But those kiddy books are soo... girly!&quot; Haruka whined. &quot;And they&#39;re 
soo stupid and sweet. It makes me get cavities just thinking about it!&quot;

Michiru rolled her eyes. &quot;Just read the book.&quot; She turned and was about 
to leave, when a thought struck her. She turned back, stood on her 
tip-toes to reach Haruka&#39;s ear and said, in the sexiest, throatiest 
voice she could muster: &quot;I&#39;ll make it worth your while... LATER.&quot;

Haruka gulped, then ran to five year old Hotaru&#39;s room.

Knocking on her new found daughter&#39;s door, Haruka opened it a crack and 
found the girl all tucked in and waiting. &quot;You ready for a story kid?&quot; 
The dark haired girl nodded, so Haruka-papa sat down next to her and 
opened the book Michiru gave her. &quot;&#39;The Happy Little Bunnies.&#39;&quot; she read 
the title with distaste. She sighed, then plunged into the story. &quot;&#39;The 
Happy Little Bunnies loved to play in the meadow together. The Blue 
Bunnies skipped, the Pink Bunnies hopped and together they 
hippity-hopped all day long....&#39;&quot; Haruka tried her best not to fall 
asleep or throw up.

&quot;&#39;They ate lettuce for breakfast, and carrots for lunch.&#39;&quot; The tall 
blonde yawned hugely. &quot;Damn, if THIS doesn&#39;t put you to sleep, NOTHING 
will..&quot; she muttered. But then she noticed that Hotaru seemed engrossed 
in the story. Her big purple eyes stared at Haruka with interest. &#39;Well, 
if the kid likes it...&#39; she thought, and kept reading. &quot;&#39;They had 
cabbage for supper and fell fast asleep on comfy beds of grass, all 
happy and snuggly together.&#39;&quot; Haruka&#39;s teeth were beginning to rot.

&quot;&#39;But there was one Little Bunny that was not happy.&#39;&quot; Haruka read on, 
hoping she had finally found the plot. &quot;&#39;This Bunny was different. It 
wasn&#39;t Pink OR Blue.&#39;&quot; &#39;Huh, sounds kind of familiar. Hmm.. I think I&#39;ll 
liven this story up a bit.&#39; So with a renewed interest, Haruka adlibbed.

&quot;It was Gold!&quot; Haruka said, with new enthusiasm. &quot;And instead of 
hippity-hopping with the other Bunnies, the Gold Bunny went searching 
for a new friend to play with. A new and SPECIAL friend.&quot; she said, with 
emphasis. &quot;The elusive Aqua Bunny!&quot;

&quot;Wooooo...&quot; exclaimed Hotaru, totally engrossed by Haruka&#39;s 
story-telling. She&#39;d never heard the story THIS way before.

&quot;Yes! The Aqua Bunny!&quot; Haruka enthused, getting caught up by her own 
fairy-tale. &quot;The Gold Bunny looked all over the place for this special 
Bunny, but she couldn&#39;t find her anywhere! The Blue and Pink Bunnies 
laughed at the Gold Bunny saying, &#39;Stupid Gold Bunny! There is no such 
thing as an Aqua Bunny! It doesn&#39;t exist!&#39; And the Gold Bunny was very 
very sad.&quot;

&quot;Aww..&quot; Hotaru&#39;s little lip trembled as she felt bad for the poor, poor 
Gold Bunny.

Haruka didn&#39;t even notice, she was too engrossed in her own story, now 
telling it more for her own benefit than Hotaru&#39;s. &quot;So the Gold Bunny 
ran far far away, so she could cry all by herself. That way the other 
Bunnies couldn&#39;t see they hurt her feelings, and call her a baby again. 
But while she was crying, there came a tap on her shoulder. Looking up, 
the Gold Bunny saw the Aqua Bunny standing right behind her! &#39;Why&#39;re you 
crying little Gold Bunny?&#39; the Aqua Bunny asked.

&quot;&#39;Because you don&#39;t exist.&#39; the Gold Bunny sniffed, not quite believing 
her eyes.

&quot;The Aqua Bunny blinked in confusion. &#39;I don&#39;t?&#39; she asked, looking down 
at herself. She pinched herself. &#39;Ouch! Well, I feel like I exist.&#39;

&quot;The Gold Bunny was sooo happy! &#39;Will you be my friend?&#39; she asked.

&quot;&#39;Of course.&#39; the Aqua Bunny smiled.&quot; Haruka hadn&#39;t noticed that she&#39;d 
stopped turning the pages of the book.

&quot;The Gold Bunny then said: &#39;Yay!&#39; and hopped on top of the Aqua Bunny 
and ravished her, making passionate lo-&quot;

&quot;HARUKA!!&quot; a shrill voice cut the blonde off mid-sentence.

Haruka blinked then looked up at Michiru. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s NOT how the book goes!&quot; Michiru stated, ripping said children&#39;s 
story from the blonde&#39;s grasp.

&quot;Uhm, yeah, well, I was livening it up a bit.&quot; Haruka replied, at least 
looking a bit sheepish. The aqua haired woman merely pointed to the 
door. Head hung, the Wind Senshi trudged out of Hotaru&#39;s room. &#39;So much 
for acting out the story tonight..&#39; she thought.

Michiru quickly finished the story the right way, hoping to do damage 
control. This had better not bite them in the ass someday.

---- 10 Hotaru Years Later (i.e. roughly 6 months) ----

The Outer Senshi House was shattered by a piercing scream.

Thundering down the hall, ran Haruka and Michiru to burst down the door 
of their precious Hotaru&#39;s room. What was wrong? Had a daimon attacked!? 
Was she in some sort of danger??

The pair skidded to a halt in the doorway.

And just stared in shock.

To see Hotaru casually undressing Chibi-Usa with one hand under the pink 
haired girl&#39;s skirt. She looked up sharply at her parents&#39; intrusion. 
&quot;Hey! Get out of here!! Can&#39;t a girl have some privacy??&quot; She threw her 
pillow at them and it bounced off a stunned Haruka&#39;s face. That said, 
Hotaru turned back to Chibi-Usa. &quot;Now, I&#39;m gonna take off your shirt..&quot;

&quot;Oooohhh!&quot; Chibi-Usa moaned.

Haruka and Michiru quickly backed out of the room, slamming the door 
closed just as Hotaru&#39;s head lowered again to disappear under 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s skirt.

Michiru quickly turned on Haruka. &quot;Now look at what you&#39;ve done!&quot; Haruka 
merely stared at Hotaru&#39;s door; her mouth agape. &quot;This is all your 
fault! You are such a bad influence on her!&quot;

Suddenly Haruka shook her head violently. &quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! 
I saw NOTHING!!&quot; She then turned and dashed down the hallway, as if 
running from the scene Chibi-Usa and Hotaru had been displaying.

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Michiru cried, chasing after her stunned lover. She found the 
girl sitting at the table, her head steadfastly buried in the newspaper. 
&quot;Haruka?&quot;

&quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! I saw NOTHING!!&quot; the blonde repeated.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; Setsuna asked, just then arriving home from 
work.

Simultaneously, Hotaru came happily skipping into the room. 
&quot;Setsuna-mama! Guess what! I&#39;m a woman now!&quot;

Setsuna stopped mid-movement and looked from Hotaru to Haruka to Michiru 
then back to Hotaru. &quot;What?&quot; she asked, needing clarification.

Chibi-Usa then stumbled out from the hall. She draped her arms lazily 
about Hotaru&#39;s shoulders, then leaned in and licked her ear. &quot;You 
coming&#39; back to bed &#39;Taru-chan?&quot; she murmured. &quot;I want to try more of 
that... what did you call it?&quot;

&quot;Oral sex?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s it.&quot;

Setsuna dropped her bag in shock, her mouth hanging open.

&quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! I saw NOTHING!!&quot; Haruka exclaimed.

Setsuna turned to give the blonde a stern look. Haruka just kept her 
head in the paper. Seeing the Wind Senshi wasn&#39;t responding to her 
glare, Setsuna decided to be vocal. &quot;Haruka! I thought I told you to 
stop being so graphic around the kid!&quot;

&quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! I saw NOTHING!!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Setsuna, I thought we were careful around her.&quot; Michiru 
spoke up. Setsuna arched an eyebrow at her.

Meanwhile, Hotaru and Chibi-Usa were getting a little... FRIENDLY. 
Chibi-Usa&#39;s hand was slowly going up Hotaru&#39;s skirt. The purple eyed 
girl giggled. &quot;You&#39;re so naughty!&quot; she cooed happily, turning around in 
her pink haired lover&#39;s arms. She then pounced on top of her, and they 
crashed to the floor.

&quot;Hotaru!&quot;

&quot;Chibi-Usa!&quot;

&quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! I saw NOTHING!!&quot;

&quot;Now look what you did! Chibi-Usa&#39;s been tainted! She&#39;s SUPPOSE to fall 
in love with a prince in the future! A MALE prince!!&quot; screamed Setsuna. 
&quot;So NOW what are we going to tell Usagi?? That she&#39;s not going to have 
grandchildren?!&quot;

&quot;You can tell her.&quot; Michiru stated with all certainty.

&quot;Me?? Why should *I* tell her??&quot;

&quot;Because you&#39;re used to it. Don&#39;t they call you the &#39;Doom and Gloom&#39; 
Senshi?&quot;

&quot;But.. but.. that&#39;s not fair!&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re the one wearing the black fuku.&quot;

&quot;Wha?? What&#39;s THAT suppose to mean?!!&quot;

&quot;Good luck Setsuna!&quot; Michiru then grabbed her lover and raced off for 
the garage. Moments later a car engine was heard, then the distinctive 
sound of peeling out.

Setsuna sighed, then called up Usagi. &quot;Hi hi!&quot; her Princess&#39;s 
hyper-cheerful voice answered.

&quot;Uhm, hello Usagi-chan.&quot; Setsuna replied, rubbing the bridge of her 
nose.

&quot;Oh HI Setsuna-san!!&quot; Usagi chirped.

Setsuna was beginning to get a headache; this was DEFINITELY not going 
to go well... &quot;Usagi-chan, listen, I have something kind of important to 
tell you..&quot;

&quot;What is it??&quot;

Suddenly there came a pair of screams from the floor.

&quot;What was that!?&quot;

&quot;The television..&quot; Setsuna lied, trying desperately not to look behind 
her.

&quot;But it sounded like Chibi-Usa..&quot;

&quot;No, it didn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;But.. but.. I recognize her voice, Setsuna. My Usagi senses are 
tingling!&quot;

&quot;Puu-chan? Are you talking to Usagi-mama?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked as Hotaru 
recovered. Suddenly the receiver was yanked from the Time Guardian&#39;s 
hands. &quot;Usagi-mama?? I&#39;m a woman now!!&quot; she exclaimed happily.

&quot;What?&quot; Usagi asked, not sure what she was hearing.

&quot;Here! I&#39;ll show you!&quot; Chibi-Usa then set the phone down and pounced on 
Hotaru again.

It took Usagi twenty minutes to figure out what Chibi-Usa was doing.

&quot;Chibi-Usa..&quot; she gulped. &quot;Just who are you doing that with?&quot;

&quot;Hotaru-chan, of course!&quot; Chibi-Usa responded in a &#39;Duh! Who Else?&#39; kind 
of voice.

Usagi promptly dropped the phone, having fainted.

&quot;Isn&#39;t this neat, Usagi-mama? I&#39;m in love! Usagi-mama?&quot; Chibi-Usa was 
left hanging.

On the other end, Usagi&#39;s little brother was poking her with a stick.

&quot;Don&#39;t poke your sister!&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother admonished him. She picked up 
the discarded phone. &quot;Hello? Tsukino residence.&quot;

&quot;Hi Auntie!&quot; Chibi-Usa perked up. Behind her, Setsuna was trying to get 
to the phone to head Chibi-Usa off, but Hotaru was effectively keeping 
her from it.

&quot;Oh hello, Chibi-Usa! How are you?&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother asked, happy to hear 
the girl&#39;s voice. &quot;Are you having fun at your sleepover?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s wonderful dear!&quot;

&quot;Yes, we&#39;re playing a new game!&quot;

&quot;And what&#39;s that?&quot;

&quot;Oral sex!&quot;

Usagi&#39;s mom then dropped the phone, as she too, fainted.

Usagi&#146;s brother then proceeded to poke them both with a stick.

&quot;Auntie? Auntie?&quot; Chibi-Usa looked at the phone, puzzled. Behind her, 
Setsuna had fainted at Chibi-Usa&#39;s declaration around the same time 
Auntie did. Shrugging, the &#39;Pink-Princess&#39; then hung up the phone, 
grabbed Hotaru and dragged the girl back to her room.

----

Meanwhile, back to Michiru and Haruka...

Michiru was at the wheel (Haruka was &#39;incapacitated&#39;), but she was 
paying more attention to her ranting than to the road. &quot;Where the heck 
did she get those ideas from? We were so careful! We only did it in our 
bedroom.. And that one time in shower!.. and that time in the kitchen.. 
and the living room.. and the hallway.. and the front entry way.. on the 
table.. the floor.. Hotaru&#39;s room (Michiru winced at that).. Setsuna&#39;s 
room.. the garage.. Haruka&#39;s car.. all of them... the motorcycle.. the 
helicopter... Hotaru&#39;s parent-teacher conference.. her school play... on 
her desk... the library at school, ours AND Hotaru&#39;s... on national 
television that time I won the music award.. at the race track.. my art 
show.. the 100 meter dash finish line.. under the bleachers.. in all of 
the school&#39;s bathrooms.. &quot;

The list went on and on.

&quot;... Usagi&#39;s house.. Ami&#39;s house.. Rei&#39;s temple.. Makoto&#39;s house.. 
Minako&#39;s house.. No wonder people don&#39;t invite us over any more.. but 
that carpeting was so plush and inviting..&quot; Michiru started drooling.

&quot;I saw nothing! I saw nothing! I saw NOTHING!!&quot; Haruka insisted.

&quot;Hmm..&quot; Michiru paused. &quot;Maybe we WERE the cause...&quot;

Oops.

---- Epilogue ----

Usagi&#39;s scream was heard the world over. &quot;HARUKA!! MICHIRU!! I&#39;M GOING 
TO *K-I-L-L* YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;</pre>
