<h1>Eternity (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eternity-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Three weeks later, Michiru was up early and full of energy. She went 
downstairs and made herself some toast with a low calorie, no fat 
butter. Thanks to current technology it tasted just like the real thing. 
She sat down at the kitchen table with some preserves and tea. Already 
shivering slightly, the violinist quickly coated her toast with the 
sweet confection and took her breakfast and magazines back upstairs. 
Happily ensconced in her nice warm bed, the artist turned on the table 
lamp and proceeded to pore over her many magazines on wedding and 
receptions.

An arm snaked out from under the covers and wrapped around her waist. 
Haruka pulled herself closer, contentedly resting her head against 
Michiru&#39;s hip. One teal eye slowly opened, once she became aware of the 
suspicious munching.

&quot;Are you eating in bed?&quot; The blonde raised her head to look 
incredulously at her fianc&eacute;e.

Michiru didn&#39;t answer. She only licked the butter off her thumb as she 
flipped a page with her other hand.

Haruka rolled onto her back and admired her lover&#39;s delicate profile. 
Michiru turned to look at her and then lightly kissed Haruka just where 
the blonde&#39;s shoulder met her neck. She was rewarded with a soft intake 
of breath.

&quot;Now I have crumbs on my neck,&quot; the reclining woman teased sleepily.

&quot;Oops, gomen.&quot; Michiru giggled and leaned back down and licked the spot.

Haruka shivered at the sensation.

&quot;It&#39;s cold downstairs,&quot; Michiru informed her mate as she returned her 
attention to her articles.

The blonde sighed. &quot;It&#39;s probably even colder outside.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Are you going out today?&quot; Haruka wanted to know as she rolled to the 
edge of the bed.

&quot;I think I&#39;m going to be lazy and stay right here where it&#39;s warm.&quot;

&quot;I thought that since I am about to thwart your plans to plunder my 
precious body heat...&quot; Haruka trailed off as she stretched. &quot;...you 
might relocate.&quot;

&quot;Enjoy your run.&quot; Michiru smiled while Haruka scowled as she thought 
about the coming shock to her system. In a few minutes the blonde was 
dressed in her jogging suit.

She went over to Michiru&#39;s side of the bed and gave her a quick kiss 
before stealing a bite of toast and heading out the door.

An hour past and the sky had taken on a pearly, gray color. The wind 
whipped through the claw like branches of the naked trees. Michiru gave 
a sigh of contentment glad to be warm and safe from the icy bite of the 
elements. The front door slammed.

&quot;Tadaima!&quot; came the energetic shout.

Michiru was off the bed and in the bathroom in seconds turning on the 
hot water.

Haruka bounded into the room her cheeks and nose rosy from the cold.

&quot;It&#39;s snowing!&quot; she said excitedly going to the window.

Michiru went to her side and sure enough small flakes were falling from 
the darkened sky. They stood for a moment like excited children watching 
their first snowfall in their new home as the gentle falling became a 
steady flurry.

----------

The blonde finally pulled away and turned toward the bathroom then 
stopped short when she heard the water running.

&quot;Were you going to take a shower?&quot;

Michiru smiled coyly, a teasing light in her eyes. &quot;Maybe.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot; Teal eyes blinked as the blonde had been anticipating a warm 
shower to relieve her of her semi-frozen state and make her feel human 
again.

&quot;Baka, that&#39;s for you,&quot; Michiru scolded her lightly. &quot;It should be hot 
by now.&quot;

Haruka smiled and scratched her head. &quot;Arrigatou.&quot;

&quot;I will admit I&#39;m tempted to join you.&quot;

&quot;You probably should, I can&#39;t promise you how much hot water will be 
left. I can&#39;t feel my fingers.&quot; Haruka inspected her hands then quickly 
pressed one to the back of Michiru&#39;s neck.

&quot;Shima-tah!&quot; Michiru gasped pulling way.

&quot;I thought you liked my hands.&quot; Haruka looked sad, however when her head 
came up her eyes were twinkling.

&quot;We need to get you some gloves.&quot;

&quot;I have gloves,&quot; the blonde reminded her.

&quot;Ano? And you didn&#39;t wear them?? It&#39;s freezing!&quot; The incredulous aqua 
haired woman gave her now laughing fianc&eacute;e a push toward the bathroom 
door. &quot;Go take a shower.&quot;

Haruka bumped her with her hip and Michiru giggled. After the blonde 
disappeared, Michiru stayed in their room alone for a moment in thought. 
Then she tossed her silky robe on the bed and followed that with her 
nightgown before going to join her lover in the shower.

Forty-five minutes later Haruka was dressed in flannel pajama bottoms 
and a loose T-shirt and Michiru was similarly attired though her shirt 
was long sleeved. They were relaxed on the bed together reading. Haruka 
had a new novel and Michiru was still digging through wedding 
publications.

The blonde worriedly eyed the growing pile of magazines with marked 
pages. Her suspicions soon proved correct when Michiru snuggled close 
and dragged a couple into Haruka&#39;s lap.

&quot;What do you think of a wedding on the beach?&quot; she asked 
conversationally opening the pages to an article on the topic.

Haruka picked up the handset of their phone and gave it to the 
violinist.

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so you can call Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not marrying Setsuna.&quot; Michiru leaned across Haruka and replaced 
the receiver.

&quot;You can do whatever you want,&quot; Haruka declared gallantly. &quot;I&#39;m only 
concerned with the honeymoon.&quot; The blonde grinned and went back to her 
book.

Michiru had been prepared for this and so she opened a book and thrust 
the page into her mate&#39;s face.

&quot;What do you think?&quot;

&quot;You want to get married in a bikini??&quot; Surprised, Haruka took the 
magazine and inspected the tiny garment.

Michiru&#39;s voice was thoughtful. &quot;Ah, no that&#39;s not my color. That&#39;s for 
you.&quot;

Haruka sat bolt upright. &quot;Ok...&quot; she started slowly. &quot;Now... I do 
reserve the right to choose my own attire.&quot;

&quot;No bikini?&quot; the violinist said mournfully as she took back the 
magazine. &quot;You would look so kakkoi in this bikini.&quot;

&quot;Hai, I would.&quot; Haruka stated with a flash of arrogance as she flopped 
back on her pillows. &quot;In fact, I have one almost identical to it over 
there in the drawer. I&#39;ll even wear it for you, but I am not wearing it 
in front of a couple hundred people.&quot;

&quot;You think only a couple hundred will show up?&quot; Michiru sounded 
surprised.

The blonde paused. &quot;How many are you inviting?&quot;

&quot;A few,&quot; the artist mumbled.

Haruka gave up on her book and set it aside. &quot;Ok, Michiru, we need to 
talk.&quot;

Blue eyes narrowed. &quot;Aha! So you do care what I do with our wedding.&quot; 
The aqua haired woman pointed an accusing finger at her beloved.

Well and truly caught, the blonde hung her head. &quot;Hai.&quot;

The violinist produced a long checklist from seemingly thin air. &quot;Ok. 
You&#39;re in luck because Setsuna and I have already taken care of the 
flowers, but you and I need to go over the guest list and what we&#39;re 
serving after the tea ceremony.&quot;

Haruka was on her back with her arm thrown over her eyes. &quot;Entrapment,&quot; 
she groaned meekly.

Michiru poked her in the ribs with her pencil.

&quot;Ok first topic of discussion...&quot;

The blonde gave a resigned sigh. &quot;Is it too late to elope?&quot;

A hour and a half later they were taking a hot cocoa break, Haruka&#39;s 
little reward to herself for being so patient with the incessant wedding 
planning. She carefully arranged the mini marshmallows in Michiru&#39;s mug 
and handed the steaming cup to her lover.

Michiru went to get a spoon and did a double take. Her marshmallow-eyed 
cocoa was smiling crookedly up at her.

&quot;You&#39;re so silly.&quot; she said affectionately, looping her arm around 
Haruka&#39;s toned waist and squeezing.

Haruka smiled and went back to scooping a little extra mix into her mug. 
The blonde followed up with a handful of marshmallows.

They had no sooner sat down at the kitchen table than the power went 
out. Instinctively, the two senshi tensed.

&quot;I don&#39;t sense anything.&quot; Michiru offered, rising from her chair.

Now serious, Haruka flipped on the battery-operated radio. The announcer 
came on immediately, calming them both.

&quot;... -ust received notification that the eastern Crystal Tokyo suburbs 
have temporarily lost power due to the snow storm and the strain on the 
grids. We want to assure you that this will be remedied as soon as 
possible. Again this is WPLTA with your winter weekend news.&quot;

They both let out relieved sighs, then ignored the matter, instantly 
shifting gears.

&quot;I can&#39;t finish this then.&quot; The violinist gestured to her pile of 
wedding papers sounding put out.

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s terrible!&quot; Haruka sounded far more cheerful than seemed 
necessary and Michiru shot her a look. The blonde rose and went into the 
living room where the larger window would allow more light. Her lover 
went upstairs to get a blanket for them to share as the house grew 
cooler. They snuggled together and drank their cocoa. Eventually Haruka 
grew drowsy and lay down. Michiru curled up on top of her. They napped 
peacefully not even aware when the lights flickered and the power came 
back on.

When Haruka had proposed, she hadn&#39;t considered all of the minutia 
involved in getting a wedding off the ground. Luckily, they didn&#39;t have 
to worry about the reception since the Queen insisted on arraigning that 
in the huge reception hall of the Palace usually appointed for 
diplomatic banquets.

Although the blonde had much better plans for time spent alone with her 
love, she didn&#39;t find it too difficult to help finalize so many 
decisions with Michiru&#39;s impeccable taste narrowing most choices.She 
dutifully assisted Michiru in choosing two sets of invitations, one for 
the big ceremony and another for the smaller intimate gathering the 
night before. They met with several different caterers and finally 
decided on one who prepared beautiful and symbolic dishes. They were 
also quite delicious. At one point, Haruka commented that everything was 
going to be like Michiru, elegant and beautiful, earning herself a soft 
kiss.

Winter faded to spring and Michiru was off having another dress fitting 
and Haruka was working off pre-wedding stress with Makoto.

The blonde dribbled the ball.

&quot;I knew you&#39;d break down and ask her eventually.&quot;

&quot;Not even she knew.&quot; Haruka shifted trying to get past her opponent.

Makoto jumped blocking the blonde&#39;s shot. &quot;Hm, everyone knows how you 
feel about her.&quot;

Haruka feinted to the right but Makoto wasn&#39;t fooled and she lunged for 
the ball her fingers barely brushing it, it was enough to dislodge the 
ball. Haruka recovered and shot the ball between her legs before jumping 
to make the basket.

Makoto took the ball dribbling lightly. They engaged mid court and 
Haruka effectively kept the other woman pinned.

&quot;I don&#39;t recall you anticipating your proposal,&quot; the blonde observed.

As emerald eyes went a little misty, Haruka made a move to take the 
ball. However, Mako-chan returned to the present in time to surge away. 
They struggled against each other neither willing to give an inch. There 
was little sound besides the occasional squeak of sneakers and deeply 
taken breaths. The brunette rolled then, charging forward and the ball 
sailed through the hoop.

&quot;Not bad.&quot; The blonde huffed as she wiped the sweat from her brow.

Makoto grinned. &quot;I don&#39;t like to make it too easy for you.&quot;

&quot;I guess you get better by playing the best,&quot; Haruka observed with a 
cocky grin, shooting a lazy three-point basket.

The brunette blew her bangs out of her eyes, resting her hands on her 
knees. &quot;First one to score two baskets out of three wins. Loser buys 
lunch.&quot;

Teal eyes narrowed fiercely. &quot;You&#39;re on.&quot;

Since the wedding party was so small they had opted to skip a rehearsal 
dinner. Instead they planned to have a formal tea ceremony. It was a 
ritual in which Haruka and Michiru both took great pleasure. They could 
think of no better way to celebrate with their friends.

Setsuna was excited about being in charge of making the tea. Tea was her 
favorite drink and she had long ago perfected the elements of the 
ceremony.

The guest list was small mainly consisting of the Royals and the Inner 
senshi along with their families. The ceremony itself would be followed 
by Michiru&#39;s version of a &quot;light&quot; dinner; so far there were three tables 
of food.

Haruka deftly wrapped her navy silk kimono. She had already donned her 
hakama skirt and now her hands were on autopilot as they lay the garment 
lapels left over right. She much preferred the male version of the 
kimono, as it felt more comfortable to her. Somewhere nearby her future 
wife was being fitted in a gorgeous aqua article that the blonde had 
just been able to glimpse before Setsuna and Minako had stuffed it back 
in the box.

Haruka checked her reflection making sure that she had everything in its 
correct place. A second set of hands lightly rearranged the silk at her 
collar. The blonde looked down into smiling blue eyes.

&quot;There,&quot; Michiru whispered with a smile as she smoothed away a small 
wrinkle.

Haruka was awestruck. Michiru&#39;s hair was up in an elegant style and 
decorated with combs. She looked so beautiful in her kimono. She winked 
at Haruka. The blonde offered her arm to her fianc&eacute;e and they went to 
meet their friends.

The tea ceremony was wonderful and all that they had hoped. Sensing the 
mood of reverence and solemnity among the elders, the children paid 
respectful attention. There was only one near miss with an antique cup. 
Chibi-Usa flushed scarlet as she quickly recovered her poise. Hotaru got 
jabbed in the foot for laughing.

Michiru knelt next to Haruka and darted looks at her collected partner 
out of the corner of her eye. Haruka&#39;s eyes were closed and she looked 
breath-takingly beautiful. She was marrying the person that she loved 
more than anything. She was finally getting married. Truly a dream that 
was now a sudden wonderful reality.

After the last of the tea had been served, Rei blessed the couple of 
honor. When she finished her impassioned murmuring, all of the candles 
flared briefly.

In the room where the tables were set up, tulle was draped around with 
strands of small lights running through it. Tall elegant arrangements of 
lilies dotted the tabletops. The guests supped on a lavish array of food 
including split oysters with keepsake pearls tucked in the raw flesh, 
the bride&#39;s favorite sashimi, and the traditional pastries that Makoto 
had made as a favor to the couple. These days it was so difficult to 
find someone else who possessed the knowledge or the skill to make them. 
The guests left with small bags of confections including molded white 
chocolate violins and tiny milk chocolate pianos.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe this. It&#39;s like a dream,&quot; Michiru whispered as they 
drove home after the dinner.

Haruka had the convertible&#39;s top down and the violinist was letting the 
wind run through her fingers.

Haruka laughed softly. &quot;Why? It was meant to be.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;You were destined to be mine,&quot; Haruka said earnestly as she glanced 
into her lover&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Michiru sighed and her hand went to where Haruka&#39;s strong one 
rested on the gearshift. Slender fingers enfolded lean ones. They didn&#39;t 
speak anymore, but both were aware of a deep feeling of contentment just 
being together.

Once home they kissed lightly then separated. Haruka and Michiru were 
sleeping in the guest bedrooms until the next evening when they would be 
officially married. In truth they had considered themselves married for 
so long that this was a mere formality for them.

At eleven thirty that night, Haruka stumbled down the hall to get a 
glass of water. As she returned to her solitary bed, she glanced to the 
room where Michiru was sleeping. The door was slightly ajar. The blonde 
padded down the hall and rested her hand on the latch. She listened for 
a moment but heard nothing. Assuming her fianc&eacute;e was lost in her own 
little world of dreams, she went back to the other guest bedroom.

Blue eyes looked up guilty at her from the other side of her bed.

&quot;Gomen nasai,&quot; Michiru whispered. &quot;I&#39;m weak.&quot; She bit her lip.

Haruka laughed at that. &quot;You&#39;re the strongest person I know. Come on.&quot; 
She held out her hand.

&quot;Nani?&quot; Michiru took it, worried that she was about to be exiled back to 
her lonely bed.

Haruka guided them out into the hall then turned right pulling her lover 
into their bedroom.

Together they tossed the decorative pillows on the floor and crawled 
under the covers. Michiru scooted close and Haruka put her arm around 
the violinist. They cuddled, smiling at each other.

&quot;Michiru.&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

The blonde kissed her fianc&eacute;e lightly on the forehead. &quot;Goodnight.&quot;</pre>
