Makareus stood on the metal rooftop of the main observatory of Tokyo 
Tower, observing his minions bustle about making the final preparations 
for the gate ritual. The chilly night wind was blowing hard from the one 
hundred and fifty metre height, whistling through the orange steel 
girders and causing the assembled group of mages&#39; assorted coloured 
robes and cloaks, and not to mention the demon&#39;s own black cloak, to 
snap sharply in the air. Incandescent lights from many large lamps laced 
in between numerous transmitters illuminated the tower, and hence the 
top of the observatory, combining with the pale light from the full moon 
above and dispelling most the darkness. Makareus and his followers could 
be easily seen due to the lights if the observer was close enough, but 
at this stage it did not matter. Everything was finally coming to 
fruition.

The seven-foot tall and imposing figure looked over his shoulder to 
where his right hand youma was coordinating his remaining troops into a 
defensive position on top of the observatory, while the rest were 
already gathered down on the ground floor and just below in the main 
observatory of Tokyo Tower. Iason was still wearing his human 
masquerade, the creature&#39;s artificial tie and black ponytail fluttering 
wildly about in the wind as he pointed to various spots on the rooftop, 
indicating to his Lord&#39;s troops where to place themselves. It seemed to 
Makareus that the youma had gotten back his nerve and was now acting 
like his usual self. For that, the demon was pleased. Replacing such a 
high-ranking, and frankly, quite capable aide would prove most 
troublesome. One had to be extremely careful whom they put their trust 
in. Even a servant of the lowliest standing could sow the seeds of your 
destruction if you were too trusting around them. Filtering out would-be 
usurpers from his continually swelling ranks was a never-ending task for 
Makareus. One could never be too vigilant.

Makareus turned his piercing gaze back to his older brother&#39;s former 
mages, the demon&#39;s twin long grey tresses hanging from beneath his hood 
fluttering in the breeze as he did so. Tokyo Tower had been secured very 
easily. There had only been a minor human presence in the tower, and 
they had all been summarily disposed of. Makareus&#39; eyes moved over the 
carefully placed gate spell components situated specifically on each 
point of the scrawled black pentagram; Tzetloch weed from the shores of 
Myhithirial Prime; a vial of drained hyphollic fluid of a Slogoraoth 
beast; a chaos gem from the belt of Nureoff; and brimstone and amber, 
both latter materials collected from Earth. It was strange to think that 
all those fairly mundane items, coupled with a few arcane words and 
gestures, could open a tear in the very fabric of reality that could be 
further coaxed into a massive interdimensional passageway. Anybody could 
do it too; no skills in the magical arts were even necessary. Though, 
Makareus preferred to let a youma with some arcane experience handle the 
conjuring. Why would he bother with such a thing if there were perfectly 
able spell weavers at his disposal?

The demon put one black gloved hand on the ornately crafted pommel of 
his sword and looked out over the abundant points of light of the city 
of Tokyo at night, taking in the sprawling human capitol. Tokyo was 
certainly a... peculiar place. The imperceptible barriers that separated 
the infinite number of different planes of existence were thin here, 
weak, and those weak parts were also fairly plentiful. To open a small 
portal to Makareus&#39; home dimension of Pandemonium required only a little 
magical effort. Perhaps the location of Tokyo was actually the nucleus 
for all the dimensions, where every plane of reality intersected with 
one another, creating a hub for prospective dimensional travellers. It 
would explain for a lot of bizarre occurrences that Makareus was not 
responsible for. Or perhaps it was merely a random anomaly. Whatever the 
reason, it had made choosing a focal point for the impending invasion of 
the planet simple.

&quot;It is ready, my Lord,&quot; said a feminine voice, disturbing the dark 
figure&#39;s thoughts. &quot;The reagents have been prepared, and the casting can 
now proceed.&quot;

Makareus looked down at the robed mage before him, noting the uneasiness 
in the creature as she shuffled her feet nervously. She had a right to 
be afraid. Who could stand before him and not prevent themselves 
trembling in terror? Makareus was a being of pure chaos, an immortal 
demon who was far beyond the level of an insignificant youma. Birthed 
from nightmares and given dreaded form, he was only one step below the 
gods themselves.

&quot;Then proceed,&quot; Makareus ordered conceitedly, glaring coldly at his 
inferior.

The mage nodded anxiously and then quickly scrambled into position in 
the centre of the large pentagram drawn on the observatory roof as her 
fellows retreated from the general vicinity. The youma took a moment to 
consult a tattered piece of parchment pulled out of her robe, and then 
stuffed it back up a sleeve. While Makareus watched impatiently, she 
raised her hands firmly above her with fingers spread, and started to 
bark out a series of incantations. As the spell caster continued, each 
word of power began to take on a booming timbre that echoed out over the 
city, and the youma commenced moving her arms in smooth, flowing 
motions, punctuating every utterance with a precise gesticulation. 
Purplish sparkles manifested from the mage&#39;s fingertips, trailing behind 
them as they moved and then dropping lethargically downwards, but fading 
away before hitting the rooftop. Suddenly, each component of the spell 
burst into blue flame in succession around the five points of the 
pentagram, the tendrils of the fire licking high into the air and waving 
erratically about in the wind. The mage&#39;s body trembled, as if under 
extreme stress, but she kept up her chanting and gestures, the 
glittering sparks showering off her fingertips becoming a deeper shade 
of purple that hurt the eye as their frequency increased. A barely 
noticeable line grew visible several feet out in the open air from Tokyo 
Tower&#39;s main observatory surrounded by a crackling display of gradually 
spreading multicoloured energy bolts, Makareus&#39; exceptional eyesight 
allowing the phenomenon to make itself known to only him at first. The 
line was a dark red, a scar on the night&#39;s sky, blotting out the stars. 
The image reminded Makareus of the blasted plains of Morderith, where 
the felled Khairephon&#39;s war legion were currently stationed, awaiting 
the invasion of Earth and subsequently its home dimension. It seemed 
that this rip in reality allowed one to see onto the plane on the 
opposite side, rather than just displaying an utter dark void of 
nothingness. Meanwhile, the robed youma intensified the strength of her 
invocation, the sound of her voice easily being heard above the howling 
wind. Without warning, the azure fires burning the spell reagents 
incinerated the materials completely, and then shot in spiralling bolts 
of flame towards the centre of the ebony pentagram, with the ash of the 
former components contained within them. The mage didn&#39;t flinch in the 
slightest as the searing flames fired directly towards her however, and 
was no doubt not the least bit surprised as they just stopped short from 
setting her alight and coalesced instead. The trapped ashes knitted 
together to form a silverly circular object that levitated in the air 
while it revolved slowly in a circle, basking untouched in the hot blue 
flames.

The mage collapsed to her knees, her arms dropping like lead weights to 
her sides as she panted heavily. &quot;The.... the deed is... done,&quot; the 
youma declared between laboured breaths, while beads of perspiration 
fell to the metal platform from under her hood. After taking several 
moments to compose herself, the spell caster stood up on unsteady legs 
and gingerly reached out to the metallic disc that still hung rotating 
in the air before her. She gently grasped the object from the azure 
fire, evidently not being burned at all, and removed it from its flaming 
container. As she did so, the flames snuffed out completely, as if a 
blanket had been thrown over them. &quot;This medallion binds the portal to 
this plane,&quot; the youma explained as she approached Makareus, dangling 
the silver disc from her hand by its thin and equally silver chain. The 
medallion was inscribed with complex script and designs that Makareus 
didn&#39;t recognise, but the demon knew that they must hold significant 
arcane power. The robed mage handed the disc to the black-clad figure 
reverently. &quot;It allows the portal to remain in a stable state while it 
grows in size. It must be protected by all costs. If it is damaged, or 
worse destroyed, the consequences will be catastrophic to say the 
least.&quot;

Makareus slipped the chain of the medallion over his head and let the 
conjured artefact hang from his neck. He passed his gloved hand over the 
metallic item, and then it vanished suddenly from view, the demon having 
put a minor shadow glamour over it for safety&#39;s sake. Magic. There was 
always some problem with it that led to untold carnage and ruin. But 
unfortunately, magic was usually a necessary danger for many of 
Makareus&#39; plans. At least he didn&#39;t have to rely on Thrinakie to provide 
it anymore, however.

Makareus dismissed the youma mage with an absent wave of his hand, and 
then looked out across the dark horizon of the city, in the direction 
his former headquarters were located. Taller buildings blocked the view 
of the skyscraper, but the demon didn&#39;t really need to see it. He was 
confident that the office building was now the tomb of this planet&#39;s 
defenders, the Sailor Senshi. Lazarus and the Silent Blades would not 
fail in their task. It was simply inconceivable. Makareus smiled smugly. 
From here on out, all he had to do was wait for the gateway&#39;s size to 
increase to allow more and more of his armies to slip through into this 
world, and another successful dimensional invasion would be under his 
belt. Yes, all he had to do was wait.

******

Rei walked purposefully out of the enemy&#39;s office skyscraper at a brisk 
pace, her comrades close by her side. Hers and the other Sailors&#39; and 
Mamoru&#39;s most grievous wounds had all been totally healed by Hotaru, 
making the miko feel somewhat refreshed despite her body&#39;s small ongoing 
aches and pains from her remaining superficial cuts and bruises, 
allowing her to walk with relative ease. Rei and the others had also 
detransformed to let their tattered outfits restore themselves; none of 
them had wished to travel to Tokyo Tower in the cold night dressed in 
shredded rags, even in a car.

Rei and her friends had encountered no further resistance in the 
twenty-storey building when they took a short breather for Hotaru to 
tend to the Fire Senshi&#39;s wounds --the other Sailor Senshi and Mamoru 
having already been previously seen to-- and also none when they had 
journeyed downwards on the remaining working elevator and vacated the 
premises. Rei surmised that any surviving youma had been cowed by the 
tremendous amount of casualties they had received whose bodies were now 
currently slowly rotting in the tall building&#39;s hallways, and by their 
leader&#39;s defeat and consequent death. Ultimately, Lazarus hadn&#39;t been 
too tough to vanquish, a fact that Rei&#39;s mind found difficult to 
comprehend. Near the end of her battle with the assassin, the miko had 
almost felt like giving up. Almost. But after calling on what reserves 
of strength and will she had left, and with Lazarus&#39; taunts helping to 
spur her on, Rei had burst back into the fight and emerged victorious. 
Although, she had to admit, the youma had lost his cool in the dying 
moments of the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, allowing her to easily take advantage of his lack 
of focus. The Senshi of Fire wondered why Lazarus&#39; mask hadn&#39;t foreseen 
her evading his finishing blow and his ensuing demise before the events 
came about. Perhaps there was a flaw in the mask? Rei supposed she would 
never know. The ebony artefact was dust blowing in the wind now, along 
with her hopes of ever being involved with Usagi again. But inside, 
Rei&#39;s heart weighed easier in her chest. She had made the correct 
decision. The fact that her dream of being together with Usagi truly was 
dead still hurt deeply, but she could take the pain for her love&#39;s sake.

&quot;Oh great, your fan club is still here, Rei,&quot; Minako remarked in a 
long-suffering sigh as the group approached the waiting Tsubasa and 
Sanjuro across the street from the skyscraper. Both men perked up as the 
Fire Senshi and company made their way towards them, the pair looking 
pleased as they quickly exited their blue compact car to eagerly meet 
them.

As Rei and the others came closer, Sanjuro whipped out a camera from 
behind his back and snapped a photo, the sudden flash causing the team 
to abruptly halt in their approach and blink rapidly, trying to clear 
the bright spots obscuring their vision.

&quot;Aah! No pictures! I&#39;m a mess!&quot; Minako implored, holding out one hand in 
front of the camera and recoiling away, while attempting to cover her 
dirty face and ruffled blonde hair with the other.

Rei glowered at Sanjuro levelly, making the man half-smile wanly and 
shrug his shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s my &#39;hero&#39; shot,&quot; he explained sheepishly. &quot;I 
couldn&#39;t resist, you know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m relieved you&#39;re alright, Rei,&quot; Tsubasa said in a heartfelt tone, 
saving the ex-reporter from a verbal lashing by the Senshi of Fire. 
There was a polite cough from Michiru, causing him to redden. &quot;Uh, I&#39;m 
relieved everyone&#39;s alright...&quot; Tsubasa hastily amended, shuffling his 
feet guiltily as he looked down to the ground.

&quot;Just another night in Tokyo,&quot; Rei said sarcastically, bending her head 
back and then rolling it around in gentle circles, getting the kinks out 
of her neck.

&quot;So, since you lot are all here in... more or less one piece,&quot; Sanjuro 
said, pausing for an instant as he eyed Rei&#39;s still scarred visage that 
was caked with dried blood. &quot;I guess that means that all the youma are 
all totally wasted in there. I never lost faith in any of you to get the 
job done for a second!&quot;

&quot;And who was the guy ready to bolt when all that glass fell on the car 
roof...?&quot; Tsubasa queried evenly, giving his spiky-haired companion a 
withering look.

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m no hero,&quot; Sanjuro said quickly, holding his hands out and 
shrugging again. &quot;I leave that to the professionals.&quot; He shot a cheesy 
smile at Rei and her friends.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that the truth,&quot; the miko commented sardonically, rolling her 
eyes.

&quot;We can&#39;t dally here,&quot; Ami cut in, forestalling any more banter and 
getting things back on track. &quot;We must proceed to Tokyo Tower 
*immediately*. Time is of the essence; we don&#39;t know what could be 
happening there at this very moment.&quot;

Rei and the other Sailor Senshi plus Mamoru nodded in grave agreement. 
It was glaringly obvious to them all that the whole ordeal with Lazarus 
and his assassins had been merely a delaying tactic to draw their 
attention away from whatever was currently occurring at Tokyo Tower. 
Whatever was happening there, it couldn&#39;t bode well for the Sailor 
Senshi and Mamoru... or even possibly the world.

&quot;Okay people, let&#39;s get moving!&quot; Usagi ordered enthusiastically, 
slapping her hands together in a series of claps, urging everyone into 
action. She then pointed to Mamoru&#39;s red sports car and Haruka&#39;s 
convertible, positioning herself in a valiant stance. &quot;To the cars!&quot; she 
commanded in a bold, yet somewhat comical, voice.

Rei rolled her eyes once more, this time at her princess&#39;s adorable 
hi-jinks, and then smirked, shaking her head slightly.

&quot;Hey! Don&#39;t just stand there, Rei!&quot; Usagi exclaimed at the grinning 
Senshi of Fire, frowning at the raven-haired girl and appearing ready to 
stamp her foot. &quot;Into a car!&quot; the blonde odango atama demanded, pointing 
again in the two vehicles&#39; general direction.

&quot;Yes, your royal magnificence,&quot; Rei mumbled under her breath as she 
moved towards Haruka&#39;s car, still smirking.

&quot;I heard that!&quot; Usagi shouted huffily, though it didn&#39;t put a damper on 
Rei&#39;s smirk in the slightest. It seemed like old times to the miko, her 
and her princess just good friends, like nothing had changed between 
them. But of course it had. The whole light-hearted joking around was a 
fa&ccedil;ade, really. Rei could tell Usagi was putting a false face over 
things, pretending nothing was wrong between them, that everything was 
fine, like things were as they had always been. It was fabricated, but 
she found herself embracing the lie just as much as Usagi was, hiding 
her true face and feelings behind her haughty smirks and usual bravado. 
Rei supposed make believe did have its uses sometimes. It helped to ease 
the pain of reality.

As Rei walked towards the convertible, she noticed that Hotaru was 
leaning heavily against it, looking as if she was letting the car 
support nearly all of her weight, while her breathing was somewhat 
ragged.

&quot;Are you okay, Hotaru?&quot; Minako asked in concern as she moved next to Rei 
in front of the young Outer Senshi. &quot;You don&#39;t look so good...&quot;

Hotaru remained quiet for a few seconds, collecting herself, before 
looking up with violet eyes highlighted by dark circles underneath them. 
&quot;I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; the young girl reassured the Senshi of Love, her face 
even paler than normal.

&quot;Perhaps you should sit this one out,&quot; Michiru suggested as she joined 
the group, and then placed the back of her hand against Hotaru&#39;s 
forehead, testing her temperature. &quot;Healing myself and the others must 
have taken a high toll on your body; no one can take *your* wounds and 
weariness away with simply a touch.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Michiru-mama,&quot; Hotaru said, finally catching her breath. &quot;I 
can go on. Ami wrapped bandages around all of my cuts; I&#39;ll be okay.&quot;

Michiru looked at the Senshi of Rebirth dubiously, appearing to consider 
the sincerity of the girl&#39;s words, before then scanning her eyes 
carefully over her thin frail body.

&quot;Hey, we don&#39;t have all night!&quot; Makoto called from next to Mamoru&#39;s car, 
making Rei, Michiru, and Minako look over their shoulders to see the 
tall brunette waving for them to get into Haruka&#39;s convertible.

&quot;Very well, Hotaru,&quot; Michiru consented, turning back to her fellow Outer 
Senshi. Hotaru smiled faintly at her guardian in gratitude.

Rei opened the front passenger door of the car as Michiru moved around 
to the driver&#39;s side and while Minako and Hotaru clambered into the 
backseat. She spared a glance behind her, and saw that Tsubasa and 
Sanjuro were also hurriedly entering their vehicle.

&quot;What do you think you guys are doing?&quot; Rei called out to the two men, 
pausing with her hand on the opened car door.

Sanjuro and Tsubasa looked at one another, and then back at the Fire 
Senshi, both also halting midway in getting into their car. &quot;Umm... 
getting into a car...?&quot; Tsubasa answered back uncertainly.

&quot;You&#39;re not coming along!&quot; Rei forbade vehemently.

&quot;You can&#39;t ditch us now!&quot; Sanjuro whined, looking at the miko with puppy 
dog eyes. &quot;I wanna know what&#39;s going down at Tokyo Tower! I know it&#39;s 
something kick ass!&quot;

&quot;Rei, we must go,&quot; Michiru informed Rei from inside the car with quiet 
insistence, the aquamarine-haired woman&#39;s eyes darting between the Inner 
Senshi and Mamoru&#39;s red car as it pulled away from the curb.

&quot;Grrr,&quot; Rei growled, getting in to the convertible beside the Senshi of 
the Ocean and deciding to leave Tsubasa and Sanjuro to their own 
devices.

&quot;Man trouble?&quot; Michiru inquired innocently with a small controlled smile 
and a single, raised, elegant eyebrow. Rei merely shot her a look that 
would have slain a lesser woman, and then forcefully put on her seatbelt 
with a hard click.

******

Sailor Mars bent her head back completely, looking straight upwards at 
the three hundred and thirty three metre tall broadcasting tower that 
loomed before her and her companions. Arguably the city&#39;s most 
recognisable landmark and tourist attraction, the brightly lit Tokyo 
Tower certainly didn&#39;t appear very inviting to Mars at the moment. Loud 
crackles of electrical energy filled the night air, while a chain of 
multicoloured lightning bolts surged along several of the white and 
orange metal support girders of the tower and around the red glaring 
tear in the dark sky, the low altitude, cloudless, and localised storm 
painting a vastly portentous and daunting picture. But that wasn&#39;t the 
only thing that disturbed Sailor Mars. The feeling that she had 
experienced outside the enemy&#39;s skyscraper had returned, but with 
increased force. It made the miko feel tense and uneasy, wanting to 
strike out at what was responsible for the unpleasant sensation and 
dispel it for some relief, but there was nothing apparent to strike out 
at. Sailor Mars looked over to where Sailor Moon was standing, gaping up 
at Tokyo Tower with wide eyes. She had to stay sharp. Her princess&#39;s 
life was still on the line; Setsuna&#39;s foretold defining &#39;moment&#39; that 
could spell the end for Sailor Moon&#39;s existence having not come about 
yet. However, Sailor Mars knew it was close. Very close. Her mind called 
back the divined vision she had received through the Fire, going over 
its contents one more time, trying to find some clue if it related to 
Setsuna&#39;s &#39;moment&#39;, and if so, what the &#39;moment&#39; actually entailed. But, 
as the raven-haired girl had suspected, it was no good; she still gained 
no further insight from her vision. Mars was certain she would be 
enlightened when the prophesised event was upon her however. She just 
hoped she would be able to act in time to prevent a tragedy that her or 
the other senshi and Tuxedo Kamen would never recover from.

Sailor Mars broke her gaze away from the paranormal display taking place 
above her, and turned it to the other uninviting scene before her. The 
entire ground floor of Tokyo Tower was covered by all sorts of hideous 
youma, the dozens of foes watching the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen 
through the clear glass walls, shooting the group threatening scowls and 
barking vile taunts. The creatures held their position however, probably 
waiting for Mars and the others to make the first move. The miko spared 
a glance over her shoulder to where Sanjuro and Tsubasa were currently 
hiding in safety in their car fifty metres or so back. The two guys had 
followed behind Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s and Haruka&#39;s cars as they had raced to 
Tokyo Tower --much to Mars&#39; displeasure-- but on her and most of her 
friends&#146; combined insistence, they had agreed to stay away from the 
invaded tourist attraction.

&quot;It looks like they&#39;re waiting for us...&quot; Sailor Venus said, eyeing the 
assembled enemy warily.

&quot;There are at least thirty youma, possibly more,&quot; Sailor Mercury 
contributed, tapping away on her mini super computer as she gave 
frequent glances through her blue visor at the mob of creatures. &quot;Most 
likely they have been placed there to deal with anyone who may happen 
by. And in our case, delay us from investigating the phenomenon 
occurring above.&quot;

&quot;We should get to an elevator as fast as we can,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen advised 
as he observed the kaleidoscope sparks fly around the dark red line in 
the sky. &quot;It&#39;ll take us directly to the main observatory. From this 
angle, it looks like the electrical disturbance is originating from 
there.&quot;

&quot;Right!&quot; Sailor Moon agreed heartily. &quot;Who knows what&#39;s going on up 
there? We should get there as soon as possible.&quot;

Sailor Jupiter punched one fist into her hand, glaring at the numerous 
amount of youma as a somewhat sinister half-smile pulled up one side of 
her mouth. &quot;Then let&#39;s not keep these scumbags waiting...&quot; she growled.

&quot;My sentiments exactly,&quot; Mars smirked in a feral-like grin.

Suddenly, as if on some silent signal, Sailor Mars, Tuxedo Kamen, and 
the other Sailor Senshi charged forwards towards the main entrance of 
Tokyo Tower, all knowing that there was no time to spare for an any more 
complex battle tactic.

&quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot;

Jupiter lobbed a ball of glowing white energy at the entrance of Tokyo 
Tower as she ran, blasting apart the doors and shattering many glass 
wall panes, creating a wide entryway into the foyer. The Sailor Senshi 
and Tuxedo Kamen burst into the broadcast tower, the crunch of broken 
shards of glass being pounded beneath their feet sounding out as they 
flung themselves into combat.

Sailor Mars ducked under a slash from a curved hook-like claw attached 
to one hand of a hulking four-armed youma covered with long clumps of 
thick, brown, shaggy hair as she catapulted herself into the escalating 
fray around her. She sidestepped quickly around the brutish creature and 
then bounded a couple of feet backwards, giving her room to attack.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

The miko shot a fireball at the youma, setting its hairy hide into an 
inferno. The creature howled and flailed around uncontrollable, ripping 
into any nearby comrades with its scythe-like claws as it frantically 
tried to somehow douse the flames burning its body. However, to Mars, 
the youma was already forgotten. She smashed her fist into a fish-faced 
creature, sending it sprawling over a counter of a souvenir booth, and 
then delivered a high kick into the side of another youma&#39;s head, 
eliciting a sharp yelp from the thing, similar to a wounded canine&#39;s.

The Senshi of Fire shot a hasty look over to where Sailor Moon was 
fighting, and saw that the blonde was holding her own with her tiara 
while Sailor Saturn and Tuxedo Kamen kept the horde at bay, allowing her 
to use her ranged attack fairly unhindered. Seeing her princess was in 
relative safety was a load off Mars&#39; mind, letting her know that she 
could engage the enemy while not having to worry about her. Sailor Mars 
heard a cry from Sailor Jupiter, and looked to the source of the noise 
to see the strong brunette pick up one of the brass poles that, with 
others, supported a red velvet rope barrier that led to the elevators, 
most likely there to control a crowd of visitors. However, Jupiter used 
the pole for an entirely different purpose. The tall girl swung the 
heavy brass rod in a mighty uppercut with a yell, whacking a youma with 
a burgundy furred fox head in the face, a dull clang ringing out and a 
shower of blue fluid gushing up to the ceiling from the blow.

Sailor Mars&#39; attention was brought back to her own scrape when she felt 
a rush of air behind her. The miko instinctively dived forwards and 
rolled across the floor. When she was upside down, her front towards her 
latest youma assailant, the raven-haired girl quickly slapped her hands 
together, pointing her two index fingers at the enemy.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

A fiery sphere left Sailor Mars&#39; fingertips and she completed her diving 
roll, ending up on her feet. She glanced behind her, noting the now 
shapeless youma writhing on the floor in agony engulfed in roasting 
flames with morbid satisfaction.

Mars let out a short scream of shock and pain as something blisteringly 
hot grazed her right upper arm, searing a scorched line across her fuku, 
followed by her flesh. She reflexively grabbed her burning arm, 
disturbing the wisps of smoke wafting off the charred skin and muscle, 
and gritted her teeth, stifling another cry of pain as she searched for 
the origin of the attack with fevered, angry, lavender eyes. Sailor Mars 
saw a spindly greenish humanoid youma with long lank black hair standing 
stock still a short distance from her, the immobile creature clearly 
visible in the flurry of movement and violence going on around it. Its 
eyes were closed, but a dim red light could be seen glowing beneath its 
eyelids, making the veins prominent. Suddenly, it opened its eyes, and 
twin beams of bright red energy fired straight at Mars, the rays burning 
clean through any youma in their path to their senshi target. Sailor 
Mars desperately hurled herself out of the two beams&#39; course, throwing 
herself behind a support pillar. She heard the beams crash into the 
other side, and then the sound of numerous objects hitting the floor, 
the shafts of red light no doubt taking chunks of masonry out of the 
upright structure. Mars strafed out from behind the pillar in a crouch, 
and saw that the thin youma had closed its eyes again, shutting off its 
beams.

&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;

The youma snapped its head in the fireball&#39;s direction as the blazing 
globe sailed towards it, and then opened its eyes once more. The shining 
red rays shot out of its eyes and collided with Mars&#39; attack, the force 
of the impact blowing the orb into little bits of falling flame, 
breaking straight through it as if it were nothing and onwards to the 
stunned raven-haired girl. Sailor Mars cursed and ducked, letting the 
beams only just fly over her head. She prepared to hide behind the 
pillar once more, but then the path of the rays moved, striking it and 
blocking off Mars&#39; retreat. Instead she rolled to her left, barely 
dodging the shafts of light as the youma&#39;s eyes moved with her, singeing 
the ends of her long raven locks. The Fire Senshi hurriedly manoeuvred 
herself in front of a large mass of milling youma, punching and kicking 
any who dared challenge her, while madly wracking her brain for a plan 
to deal with her red-eyed adversary.

The skinny youma closed its eyes, hunting for Mars in the pack of its 
fellows, its powerful eyes strong enough to see through its eyelids.

&quot;SHINING AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

A geyser of water suddenly banged into the side of the searching youma&#39;s 
head, taking the creature unawares and causing it to stumble. Instantly 
ice started to form on its skull and spread rapidly over its face, 
freezing its eyelids shut. Sailor Mars grinned rakishly and after 
beating off one clingy monster with her foot, she quickly vacated the 
throng of creatures, her eyes focused intensely on the blindly 
staggering lanky youma.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars drew her burning bow and launched an arrow flawlessly at the 
half-frozen red-eyed youma, forcing several other creatures to jump 
recklessly out of the way of fiery death, before the bolt took her 
target cleanly in the chest. The projectile exploded, blowing out the 
youma&#39;s insides and incinerating them in a roasting hot fire before any 
of the mess could hit the floor. Mars looked over to were Mercury was 
and flashed her a grin of thanks, to which the blue-haired genius 
responded with her own smile, before returning her attention to the 
battle.

As the miko did likewise, she realised that the youma enemy were doing a 
good job at delaying her and her comrades from reaching the elevators, 
and hence the main observatory of Tokyo Tower. The Sailor Senshi and 
Tuxedo Kamen fought bravely and skilfully, sending scores of youma to 
their graves, but the sheer numbers of the enemy were enough to 
continually push the group back time and time again. It was very 
frustrating for Mars. She knew that she and the others couldn&#39;t keep 
fighting forever, and even if they did manage to slay all the creatures, 
by then it would probably be too late to stop whatever diabolical thing 
was happening up at the main observatory level.

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Mars swore under her breath as she torched yet another youma 
to a cinder, and then backhanded another nearby across its pig-like 
features, knocking it back, while the cacophony of her fellow senshi 
fighting filled the air around her. The Sailors and Tuxedo Kamen needed 
to get to that observatory or all would be lost, the Fire Senshi just 
knew it. They needed another plan to get there. And fast.

******

&quot;It&#39;s not looking very good; I think they&#39;re in trouble,&quot; Tsubasa said 
across to Sanjuro who was standing on the other side of the rented 
compact car, busy taking pictures with a telephoto lens attached to the 
camera hanging around his neck. The ex-reporter had been excitedly 
taking shots ever since Sailor Mars had went into that big office 
building with the rest of her pals, and it didn&#39;t look like the 
spiky-haired man was ever going to stop. Tsubasa wondered when he was 
going to run out of film; he must have taken a hundred pictures by now. 
Tsubasa had tried to dissuade Sanjuro from disobeying Mars&#39; request for 
no photos, but it was useless. All the self-centred man could think 
about was how famous he was going to be for getting such &#39;action packed&#39; 
pictures of the Sailor Senshi, and how all the newspapers would be 
throwing jobs and money at him.

&quot;Pfft, dude, that&#39;s what you said last time, back at that other joint,&quot; 
Sanjuro said as he snapped another photo, not taking his attention away 
from the ground floor of Tokyo Tower. &quot;Sure, before it looked like those 
youma were about to wear their asses as hats, but all those monsters got 
owned in the end.&quot; He lowered his camera, and looked over to his 
worrying companion. &quot;That&#39;s just their way of fighting, you know? They 
get beat up, and then come back and kick the crap outta everything.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Tsubasa murmured uncertainly, squinting his eyes as he 
tried to get a good look at what was happening in the tower. He couldn&#39;t 
make out Sailor Mars anywhere, though he did spot the older 
aquamarine-haired woman he had seen before at the high-rise plaza 
earlier, and the blonde with the red ribbon in her hair, who was 
currently shooting yellow beams of energy out of one pointed finger. 
That was certainly something you didn&#39;t see everyday, evil monsters 
overrunning Tokyo Tower notwithstanding. Tsubasa angled his head to the 
side, hoping to somehow get a glimpse of the fiery miko, but to no 
avail.

Sanjuro sighed deeply, letting go of his camera and allowing it to rest 
on his chest. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m sure your girlfriend is fine; kicking 
ass and taking names like she always does,&quot; he drawled, rolling his eyes 
in exasperation.

&quot;She&#39;s *not* my girlfriend,&quot; Tsubasa replied testily, with more 
bitterness in his tone than he would have liked.

&quot;Yeah, too bad for you, huh?&quot; Sanjuro smirked, and then returned to 
aiming his camera at Tokyo Tower and taking photos.

Tsubasa didn&#39;t dignify Sanjuro&#39;s remark with a response, and instead let 
out a depressed sigh and looked up at the strange goings on taking place 
in the sky by the white and orange landmark. He wondered if the police 
were going to show up soon; someone in this city must have noticed what 
weird stuff was happening right this second. It would not do for him or 
Sanjuro to be caught at the scene of such a disturbance however, 
especially after the police had them on file for being at Juuban High 
School during that awful youma attack.

Tsubasa looked back to the ground level of the broadcast tower, and 
frowned when he couldn&#39;t make out any of the Sailor Senshi anymore. A 
wall of rippling youma was all his anxious eyes could see, no matter 
where he looked. He swallowed nervously. Maybe everything was really 
fine, and that Mars and her friends had just fought onwards to a higher 
floor. Yes, that was it. Nothing to be worried about.

&quot;Damn, I lost &#39;em,&quot; Sanjuro complained, finally giving up on snapping 
any more pictures.

Tsubasa felt sweat bead on his brow as his now rather frantic eyes 
scanned over the horde of youma, trying to see any of the senshi. 
Detecting none of the girls, or even the formally dressed man that 
accompanied them, he glanced up at Tokyo Tower, looking to see if an 
elevator was ascending along the partially see-through shaft running up 
the centre of the landmark. No. There wasn&#39;t. He swallowed hard again. 
Something was wrong, he just knew it. But what could he do? Tsubasa was 
just your average guy, no one special. He had no super powers; hell, he 
didn&#39;t even know any martial arts or anything like that. Tsubasa looked 
up at the electrical display in the sky, and saw that the long red tear 
had widened and lengthened since the last time he had saw it. He lowered 
his head back down, staring at the ground. So this was the moment he had 
been waiting for; this was the time to get involved and make a 
difference in the world. It was a peculiar feeling, having such a 
responsibility on his shoulders; he wondered if this was a feeling that 
Sailor Mars experienced most of time. Tsubasa&#39;s heart felt like it was 
in his throat, and a blanket of fear fell about him, but it was tempered 
by an exhilarating sense of anticipation. He didn&#39;t know if he had what 
it took. Tsubasa had been a bystander all his life, no real meaningful 
purpose to his existence, but here and now, he could change that in a 
single instant. He raised his head, looking once more at the daunting 
tide of youma in Tokyo Tower, and then up at the gouge in the night&#39;s 
sky. And then, all of a sudden, an odd calm came over Tsubasa, his mind 
never having been so clear. This was his one chance to make a 
difference; a chance he didn&#39;t think he would ever have again... and he 
didn&#39;t intend to let it slip by.

&quot;Give me the car keys,&quot; Tsubasa ordered Sanjuro, turning his head to the 
man.

&quot;No,&quot; Sanjuro answered reflexively, as if it was the most insane request 
he had ever heard. &quot;Why?&quot; he then asked.

&quot;Just give them to me!&quot; Tsubasa demanded, putting more force behind his 
voice. &quot;This car *is* rented with my money, you know!&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine,&quot; Sanjuro grumbled, fishing the keys out of his pants and 
tossing them over to Tsubasa, who snatched them out of the air.

Tsubasa hurriedly jogged around to the driver&#39;s side of the car and got 
in, slamming the door behind him and then putting on his seatbelt. There 
was the sound of another slam of a door from Tsubasa&#39;s left, and he 
looked over to see that Sanjuro had gotten into the car too.

&quot;What the hell do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; Sanjuro asked from the 
passenger seat, incredulous. &quot;This is a once in a life time spectacle! 
We are *not* leaving yet!&quot;

&quot;Who said anything about leaving?&quot; Tsubasa said evenly as he firmly slid 
the keys into the ignition.

&quot;Uhh...&quot; Sanjuro said dumbly, blinking at the man next to him. &quot;What do 
you plan to do?&quot; he continued, with obvious trepidation in his voice.

&quot;Buckle up,&quot; Tsubasa commanded without inflection, her eyes riveted to 
the front entrance of Tokyo Tower, a short distance straight ahead of 
the car.

&quot;Y-You can&#39;t be serious!&quot; Sanjuro exclaimed, his head snapping between 
the youma invested Tokyo Tower and the determined Tsubasa.

Tsubasa turned the car key forcefully, revving the engine hard, and then 
took off the handbrake. &quot;I said buckle up,&quot; he repeated, not taking his 
eyes off his goal.

&quot;Are you nuts?!&quot; the ex-reporter screamed, at the exact same moment 
Tsubasa put the automatic gear into drive and floored the accelerator, 
causing a loud squeal to sound out from the rear tires. The small blue 
car careered forwards, directly for Tokyo Tower, Sanjuro howling in 
terror all the while. He fumbled frantically for his seatbelt, somehow 
getting it on as the ominous view of the youma-packed ground level of 
the tower came closer and closer, filling the windshield more and more 
by the second. &quot;We&#39;re gonna get in a lot of trouble!!&quot; Sanjuro screeched 
as the car whizzed past two of the four main support legs for Tokyo 
Tower, on a certain collision course with the landmark&#39;s foyer.

******

&quot;LOOK OUT!!&quot; Sailor Mars heard Sailor Venus&#39; voice scream at the top of 
her lungs, her warning rising above the clamour of the battle.

Sailor Mars socked her current youma adversary in the jaw, and then 
broke off the conflict, quickly throwing her head over her shoulder and 
looking past the dozens of congregated creatures to see what had 
elicited such a vehement warning from the Senshi of Love. The miko&#39;s 
lavender eyes widened and almost bugged out of her head as she saw the 
speeding compact car that Tsubasa and Sanjuro had been travelling in 
hurtling directly for her and a whole lot of youma between her. Just 
what in the name of all that was holy were those numbskulls thinking!?

Mars bit off a curse and then recklessly launched herself to one side, 
along with several youma doing likewise. She crashed into some more of 
the creatures, bowling them over, before landing on top of them. There 
was a loud bang as the car smashed through what remained of the windows 
and doors, and then a series of dull thuds and sharp, abruptly cut off, 
shrieks, which no doubt came from any unfortunate youma who had failed 
to get out of the unforgiving car&#39;s path in time. The Fire Senshi hoped 
that none of the pain-wracked cries belonged to any of her friends.

The car swerved to the right, skidding along the floor and sideswiping 
more startled youma as it left black tire marks in its wake --and also 
making Mars desperately scramble backwards on the floor to avoid being 
squashed-- before the vehicle finally came to a halt. The blue compact&#39;s 
front and right side were covered with dents and its headlights were 
smashed, and also its bumper and licence plate were missing, both items 
lost under a pile of youma bodies, but other than that the car had 
appeared to have come through the ordeal in more or less decent 
condition. Of course, once Sailor Mars had torched it to so much melted 
metal along with the stupid men inside, it would be a different story 
entirely. Had Tsubasa and Sanjuro lost their minds?

&quot;Get up, Mars!&quot; the miko heard Sailor Jupiter call to her. Sailor Mars 
dragged her eyes away from the now silent car to see that Sailor Jupiter 
and the others, who had all evidently escaped the car&#39;s rampaging 
charge, were using the lull in the enemy&#39;s resistance and focus to pile 
into an elevator.

Mars swiftly clambered to her feet, and then bolted for the open 
elevator doors and towards the others, stepping on and over many prone 
dead, dying, and stunned youma, while Sailor Moon and Sailor Venus 
anxiously waved her in, shouting encouragements. After what had seemed 
like an eternity, but in actual fact were only several seconds, Mars 
finally reached the elevator and her waiting princess, the blonde giving 
her a relieved smile. The Fire Senshi flashed Sailor Moon a swaggering 
grin, and then turned back to the ruin that was Tokyo Tower&#39;s foyer, 
only to see Tsubasa and Sanjuro stumble in a daze out of their car as 
the surviving youma began to get their wits back.

&quot;Isn&#39;t that...?&quot; Sailor Venus started, but was promptly cut off by 
Sailor Moon.

&quot;We have to help them!&quot; Sailor Moon exclaimed, looking at the men with 
frantic blue eyes.

&quot;You two, get in here!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen yelled at Sanjuro and Tsubasa, 
gesturing with one hand for added emphasis.

&quot;A little fire support wouldn&#39;t go amiss,&quot; Sailor Neptune suggested from 
behind Sailor Mars, as all the senshi started joining in calling wildly 
to the temporarily stunned pair to hurry up and run to them.

&quot;Way ahead of you,&quot; Venus said, crouching and bringing up one arm. 
&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

A ray of energy blasted through a youma&#39;s chest as it moved to grab 
Tsubasa, blazing a black cauterised hole in the monster. It toppled 
backwards, just as Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara ripped into another youma who 
leapt at the two men, slicing into its stomach. Its jump was halted 
prematurely as it landed hard on its knees, clutching at its eviscerated 
abdomen.

&quot;Move it, you idiots!!&quot; Sailor Mars hollered angrily as she released a 
fireball from her fingertips, the attack exploding in a recovered group 
of youma in a large conflagration, making skin and flesh alike run like 
wax.

The severity of their situation finally dawning on the men&#39;s addled 
minds, Sanjuro and Tsubasa sprinted like crazy for the open elevator and 
the protection of the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen-- Tsubasa covering 
his head with his arms as all sorts of attacks flew over and around him 
from Mars and her comrades, while Sanjuro just screamed like a baby as 
he ran, flailing his arms wildly as the camera dangling around his neck 
bounced up and down uncontrollably on his chest.

&quot;Close the doors! Close the doors!&quot; Sanjuro begged hysterically as he 
collapsed in the elevator, tucking his legs close to his body so that 
they were completely inside.

Sailor Moon quickly hit the button to shut the doors, followed by the 
button for the main observatory level. Sailor Mars and Sailor Venus 
continued firing fireballs and energy beams respectively at the 
gathering youma as the doors closed however, only ceasing their assault 
when the gap between them was too little for their attacks to fit 
through. At last, the doors closed completely and the elevator started 
its slow, scenic, ascent, shutting out the remaining frenzied youma and 
leaving them behind on the ground floor.

&quot;Oh geez, I thought I was a goner,&quot; Sanjuro sighed in unmistakable 
relief, falling flat on his back on the elevator floor. &quot;You psychopath! 
You tried to kill me!&quot; he then yelled at Tsubasa, who was leaning up 
against a clear plastic floor length window of the elevator that took up 
most of the wall while he breathed heavily from his run, with Mercury 
meanwhile inspecting his body for any serious injuries.

&quot;I&#39;m glad the youma didn&#39;t kill you,&quot; Sailor Mars said without emotion, 
her tone making Sanjuro fall quiet. &quot;Because now I get the chance to 
murder you both myself.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t my fault!&quot; Sanjuro instantly declared, pleading to Mars with 
his eyes as he got on his knees. &quot;It was all Tsubasa! The guy flipped 
out or something!&quot; he insisted, pointing accusingly at Tsubasa. &quot;I 
didn&#39;t want to drive *into* Tokyo Tower, for god&#39;s sake!&quot;

&quot;You know, Rei, they did provide us with a chance to get to this 
elevator...&quot; Sailor Jupiter reminded Sailor Mars, causing the Fire 
Senshi&#39;s lavender eyes to sharply flick to her. The tall brunette smiled 
weakly and held up her hands in a pacifying motion.

&quot;That *is* true, Rei,&quot; Sailor Neptune joined in, smiling faintly at the 
raven-haired girl.

&quot;Don&#39;t you start,&quot; Sailor Mars muttered irritably, to which the Senshi 
of the Sea responded by simply smiling a touch wider. The miko looked 
over to Tsubasa, who had remained quiet thus far. &quot;What do you have to 
say for yourself?&quot; she asked tersely.

Tsubasa looked out the gradually climbing elevator at the slowly 
improving view of Tokyo at night, and then at Mars. &quot;I just did what had 
to be done,&quot; he reasoned, shrugging his shoulders nonchalantly.

Sailor Mars opened her mouth to respond to the lame motive, but then 
felt a light touch on her shoulder, knowing instinctively that the 
gentle hand belonged to her love.

&quot;It all worked out. Don&#39;t be angry, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly to 
her bodyguard, sparing a brief smile at Tsubasa.

&quot;But that&#39;s not the point,&quot; Mars argued, somewhat stymied by her 
princess&#39;s touch and words, her tone now sounding like she was whining 
like a petulant child, much to her dislike.

&quot;I... I think I see something,&quot; Sailor Saturn interrupted in her small 
timid voice, pointing at a spot outside the slow elevator.

&quot;Looks like we&#39;ve got company!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen loudly informed everyone as 
he saw what the Senshi of Rebirth was pointing to.

Sailor Mars followed Sailor Saturn&#39;s finger and noticed that something 
was heading straight for them at high-speed. No, it was a collection of 
somethings. As the objects came closer, the Senshi of Fire realised with 
grim recognition just what danger was approaching her and her friends.

&quot;Oh no, not these guys again!&quot; Sailor Venus lamented as the party of 
robed youma flew towards them on their levitating discs, the circular 
floating travelling devices decorated with all sorts of unrecognisable 
characters and coloured designs.

&quot;What? What is it?! What&#39;s going on?!&quot; Sanjuro wailed, looking 
frantically all around him.

There was a flash of orange light from one of the flying youma, and a 
swarm of what looked like large fireflies buzzed towards the ascending 
group, before punching through the plastic section of the elevator shaft 
and impacting hard on the adjacent clear window on the wall of the 
elevator itself, the multitude of insects striking it like a rain of 
hailstones before they dissipated into nothing, leaving behind a web of 
cracks.

&quot;Aaaah!! We&#39;re all gonna die!!&quot; Sanjuro howled, pulling himself into a 
tight ball.

&quot;None of those bugs got through; the elevator shaft provided a buffer of 
a sort,&quot; Mercury reported, ignoring the ex-reporters cries. &quot;But these 
walls won&#39;t last forever under a prolonged offensive. Try and stay away 
from them.&quot;

&quot;Um, how?&quot; Venus asked, looking around the packed elevator.

Sailor Mercury glanced around the elevator herself, and then turned her 
head to the Senshi of Love. &quot;I see your point,&quot; she conceded disquietly.

&quot;Rei, uh, Sailor Mars, what do we do?&quot; Tsubasa pitched towards the 
Senshi of Fire, eagerly awaiting her guidance.

&quot;You just do like Sanjuro and keep your head down,&quot; Sailor Mars said to 
Tsubasa, to which he looked at the cowering ex-reporter with a mixture 
of consternation and disgust, not wishing to lower himself to his level.

There was a loud thud and the elevator reverberated as a wave of 
rippling energy collided with it, the nearly invisible attack only able 
to be seen by the way it blurred the air in its wake. The wave caused 
another window of the elevator to instantly be covered totally in a net 
of fractures, the neighbouring section of the shaft already destroyed, 
but somehow it held out, only barely maintaining its shape.

&quot;Saturn!&quot; Neptune called earnestly. The woman&#39;s fellow Outer Senshi 
nodded to her in acknowledgement.

Sailor Saturn raised her Silence Glaive above her head horizontally in 
both hands, the weapon only just fitting the breadth of the elevator, 
while in the meantime more energy-based projectiles assailed the 
elevator, weakening the hard plastic windows more and more with every 
hit.

&quot;SILENCE WALL!&quot;

Jet-black bolts of lighting curved up in a jagged path to the Senshi of 
Death&#39;s Glaive from the floor, surrounding the elevator&#39;s occupants in a 
protective cage. The bits of dislodged plastic from the windows bounced 
off the invisible domed force field with the youma attacks, absolutely 
nothing getting through the tangible silence.

&quot;Cool...&quot; Sanjuro whispered, looking up in awe at Sailor Saturn, before 
unconsciously bringing up his camera in one hand and snapping a picture 
of the young girl, his fear forgotten.

&quot;It should be a pretty cushy ride now!&quot; Sailor Jupiter commented with a 
smile, obviously glad.

Sailor Mars frowned as she saw sweat start to form on Sailor Saturn&#39;s 
forehead and drip down her face, the Outer Senshi&#39;s thin arms beginning 
to tremble minutely. The miko&#39;s head swiftly whirled to Tsubasa as the 
man let out a surprised yelp, a small piece of plastic having struck him 
in the side of the head, before bouncing off to land on the floor of the 
elevator.

&quot;Hotaru, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sailor Neptune asked with deep concern in her 
voice, the woman looking at the pale girl with fretful eyes.

&quot;I... can&#39;t...&quot; Sailor Saturn forced out haltingly as her shaking 
increased. And then, suddenly, the girl dropped to her knees, her 
manifested barrier vanishing as she rested heavily on her Silence 
Glaive, her dark-haired head bowed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot; she apologised as 
Neptune joined her on the floor, putting comforting and protective arms 
around her.

Sailor Mars cursed inwardly at the new development. Healing Tuxedo Kamen 
and her fellow Sailor Senshi must have taken a lot of Saturn&#39;s power, 
greatly decreasing the girl&#39;s strength, both physical and mental.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; Sailor Moon wailed, turning to gaze out an almost shattered 
window of the elevator, attempting to make out the circling youma enemy 
through the roadmap of cracks. &quot;We&#39;re defenceless!&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t we fight back?!&quot; Jupiter growled as she ground her teeth, also 
looking out a battered window.

&quot;And lose what little protection we have? Our own attacks will surely 
destroy the windows,&quot; Sailor Mercury said, shaking her head in dismay. 
&quot;We have innocent people with us; we can&#39;t willingly expose them to 
youma attacks!&quot;

&quot;Yes! Yes! Listen to her!&quot; Sanjuro interjected vigorously, clearly very 
much agreeing with the Senshi of Water while he flinched away from 
another brightly coloured attack courtesy of the flying enemy pounding a 
window.

&quot;They&#39;re already exposed,&quot; Sailor Mars disagreed gravely. &quot;We should 
counterattack now, before they get really smart and try to take down the 
whole elevator.&quot;

&quot;Isn&#39;t that what they&#39;re trying to do?&quot; Tsubasa said somewhat calmly 
from his slightly defensive hunched stance, the man apparently managing 
to keep his cool under fire unlike his partner in crime.

&quot;We can&#39;t risk their safety, Rei,&quot; Sailor Moon overruled as a blue 
wobbling sphere of light crashed in a spot on the window by her blonde 
head, making her start slightly. &quot;We should just sit tight and hope this 
stupid snail of an elevator makes it to the observatory with all of us 
still in one piece.&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; Sailor Mars sighed, a little frustrated. She took hold of her 
princess&#39;s arm and drew her back into the centre of the elevator by the 
drained Sailor Saturn, the comforting Sailor Neptune, and the cowering 
Sanjuro. &quot;But you stand here,&quot; the miko requested in a no-nonsense tone. 
Sailor Moon reluctantly conceded, but with an exasperated purse of her 
lips. Sailor Mars began to return her attention to the youma outside, 
but noticed Tuxedo Kamen looking at her impassively from one corner of 
the elevator, their eyes meeting. Unsure if she had given him the wrong 
impression of her intentions towards Sailor Moon or not, Sailor Mars 
broke the prince&#39;s gaze and opted to say nothing. Protecting her love 
was her duty, just like it was all the Inner Senshi&#39;s duty; it was in 
her right to watch over the blonde girl.

All of a sudden, there was a deafening boom sound as one window 
completely blew out under the force of the latest robed youma attack, 
the intact but heavily fractured plastic pane flying inside the elevator 
and hitting Sailor Jupiter in the side, the brunette only barely 
managing to get her arm up in time to protect her head before it 
impacted.

&quot;Now you can attack!!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out as Sailor Jupiter kicked 
the pane out of the now breached elevator, sending it falling down the 
shaft.

The one-layered plastic section of the elevator shaft now no adequate 
protection from the youma attacks, Sailor Mars and Sailor Venus quickly 
scrambled into position by the empty window frame, the girls knowing 
their powers would be the most effective against the nimble aerial 
enemy.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

Sailor Mars tracked one disc riding youma with her blazing bow from a 
crouch by the left side of the hole in the elevator, and then let loose 
her arrow. The bolt of fire punched through the elevator shaft, the 
pointed tip of the projectile allowing it to tear past the plastic wall 
without detonating and instead barbecuing the miko and her friends. The 
arrow only struck a glancing blow against a youma&#39;s disc, but it was 
enough to trigger the hot projectile to explode. The creature was able 
to pilot its levitating device with expert skill however, and avoided 
most of the explosion by angling the bottom of its disc upwards, letting 
it take the burnt of the blast.

&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;

Venus&#39; streak of yellow light punctured the plastic part of the elevator 
shaft with ease, burning clean through it before the ray travelled 
onwards to a flying robed youma. The creature swerved erratically out of 
the beam&#39;s path, its green-hued clothes billowing hard from the fast 
movement and fierce high winds.

Sailor Mars and Sailor Venus kept up their attacks as best they could, 
but were unable to score a substantial hit on any of the youma or their 
flying discs. The enemy was simply too fast, and after realising which 
side of the elevator the Sailors&#39; shots were originating from, they 
tended to shun that region of Tokyo Tower. But mercifully, as the 
elevator travelled higher, the area in which the youma could manoeuvre 
to assault the Sailor Senshi and company was diminished, the funnelling 
girders of the tower restricting their movement greatly. Seeing that it 
was now near impossible to stop or destroy the elevator, or to kill its 
occupants, the youma peeled away from Mars and her friends and flew 
upwards, joining the rest of their allies at the main observatory.

&quot;I never even hit any of them!&quot; Venus moaned, sounding as if she had 
viewed the whole ordeal as a shoot-em-up video game.

&quot;There&#39;s always next time,&quot; Mars said grimly, certain that she and the 
others would see those particular youma again very soon.

&quot;Oh, thank god, I&#39;m so glad that&#39;s over!&quot; Sanjuro sighed in relief, once 
again collapsing back onto the floor, nearly ending up with his head 
under the crouching Neptune&#39;s skirt. But luckily for him, the 
aquamarine-haired woman&#39;s attention was elsewhere.

&quot;Are you feeling any better, Hotaru?&quot; she asked Saturn with compassion 
filling her tone and eyes.

&quot;I think so, Michiru-mama,&quot; the Senshi of Rebirth answered, looking up 
at her guardian. &quot;I still feel tired, but I feel a little stronger too.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps you should stay behind with these two gentlemen in the 
elevator,&quot; Neptune suggested gently, glancing over at Sanjuro and 
Tsubasa. &quot;You can watch over them.&quot;

Saturn shook her head, her dark locks swinging. &quot;I will go on,&quot; she 
insisted, a glimmer of steel underlying her voice, the senshi in her 
coming out. Neptune merely smiled and nodded in acquiesce.

The battered elevator started to slow more in its ascent --if that were 
possible-- until it gradually came to a halt on the main observatory&#39;s 
level, to everyone&#39;s collective appreciation.

&quot;Finally! This thing took forever! I didn&#39;t think we would ever make 
it!&quot; Sailor Moon said, letting out a long breath.

&quot;Me neither,&quot; Tsubasa murmured, but for an entirely different reason.

There was a ding and the double doors of the elevator slid open, 
revealing the darkened main observatory of Tokyo Tower. Sailor Mars 
couldn&#39;t make out any movement in the general vicinity, but her senses 
picked up the presence of a considerable force of youma close by. Very 
close by. The miko had assumed there would be a substantial number of 
the enemy on the observatory level however, so she wasn&#39;t too alarmed. 
But that didn&#39;t mean she wasn&#39;t wary.

&quot;Ehh... I think you guys better stay here,&quot; Sailor Jupiter suggested to 
Sanjuro and Tsubasa, who both nodded in agreement, the former most 
readily.

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am! I&#39;ve been scarred for life by this traumatic nightmare!&quot; 
Sanjuro declared from where he lay on the floor of the elevator. &quot;On the 
inside,&quot; he elaborated, seeing the perturbed look he was getting from 
the medically inclined Mercury. &quot;You know...? Emotionally...?&quot; he went 
on lamely. Sailor Mercury directed a look at Sailor Mars, to which the 
miko responded by rolling her eyes at Sanjuro&#39;s behaviour, causing the 
blue-haired girl to hide a giggle behind her hand.

&quot;Keep an eye on him,&quot; Sailor Mars ordered Tsubasa. &quot;And stay out of 
trouble yourself.&quot; The man simply nodded in compliance, not taking his 
eyes off the Fire Senshi.

The Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen stepped cautiously out of the 
elevator and into the dark main observatory of Tokyo Tower, the only 
illumination spilling out from the elevator behind them, the floodlights 
decorating the landmark not reaching inside the large room. A grand view 
of the city could be seen through the windows that completely covered 
the outer wall of the circular observatory that surrounded the group, 
the countless pinpricks of different lights from the buildings of Tokyo 
painting quite an exquisite tapestry for the eye.

&quot;Wait,&quot; Sailor Mars said out of the blue, halting her friends&#146; movements 
with a quick hand motion. &quot;I think... something&#39;s...&quot;

There was an inhuman growl from in front of Mars, and then a low hiss 
joined it from behind her, making the Fire Senshi and her friends spin 
around at the sources of the threatening noises, forming a defensive 
back-to-back formation, four persons facing towards each one of the two 
sides of the observatory in a ready position. Sailor Mars&#39; eyes narrowed 
as they adjusted to the darkness and made out just how many youma of all 
shapes and sizes were crowded in the room with them, every one with 
their cold eyes directed menacingly at the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo 
Kamen.

&quot;I think we&#39;re in trouble,&quot; Sailor Moon gulped from beside her 
bodyguard. Sailor Mars was certain everybody else agreed.

******

Setsuna gazed forlornly out the window of her private hospital room with 
slumped shoulders at Tokyo Tower standing tall on the horizon, watching 
the anomalous spectacle of the gradually expanding interdimensional 
portal as it became increasingly more noticeable in its defacement of 
the dark cloudy night&#39;s sky. Soft moonbeams spilled into the otherwise 
dark room, the streak of light illuminating the Guardian of Time in a 
pale glow as she sat upright in her hospital bed. Events were finally 
drawing to a conclusion. To an end.

Chibi-Usa had visited the green-haired woman frequently during the night 
with Luna and Artemis both hiding in her shirt from the on-duty nurses, 
but now those visits had dropped off completely. Setsuna knew that the 
future princess was too tired to continue her patrol between her and 
Haruka&#39;s rooms. The Senshi of Time welcomed the solitude however. She 
was used to it; it was a feeling she was intimately familiar with. And 
on this night, she wanted to be left alone.

Setsuna had been staring out of the window for some time now, a length 
of time her normally astute mind had lost track of long ago. It was late 
into the night, and she really should have been sleeping, resting her 
weary and wounded body to hasten her recovery and subsequent release 
from Minato General Hospital. The Senshi of Time let out an almost 
silent sigh, barely audible to the casual listener. No, regardless of 
how tired she was a peaceful slumber would definitely be unattainable 
tonight, much like it undoubtedly was for Haruka one floor above her. 
And not to mention Chibi-Usa. How could you sleep when the people you 
cared about were out there fighting for their very lives? How, when 
someone who you loved with all your heart and soul was fighting without 
you by their side?

The Guardian of Time smiled faintly; a resigned, sad smile. That wasn&#39;t 
quite right. While Michiru would wish for Haruka to be along side her, 
and similarly with Hotaru and Chibi-Usa, it was different for Setsuna. 
She didn&#39;t have her love&#39;s heart; she never had. She wasn&#39;t the one Rei 
craved for to be by her side. The one the fiery miko longed for was 
already there, even if it wasn&#39;t for the desired reasons the girl would 
have liked. Such was the story of Setsuna&#39;s existence.

Setsuna&#39;s shoulder&#39;s slumped just a tad more as she saw pinpricks of 
different coloured lights twinkle around the lower half of Tokyo Tower, 
a countless number blinking in and out of view at a rapid rate. It 
wouldn&#39;t be long now. At times, the woman truly hated her life. There 
were some pleasant spots naturally, and she had met many good people who 
were now her friends and family. But then, she had been destined to meet 
all of those particular people from the moment she was born. Destiny. 
Fate. It was strange how those simple equivalent words could cause such 
pain and misery in one&#39;s life. Setsuna had learned a long, long, time 
ago that she was bound by an inescapable and merciless fate, a fate that 
forced her to guard over the Gates of Time for all time, and 
consequently trapped her in other harsh chains of Destiny. When she had 
finally understood that she was to be forever alone, that no one would 
ever hold her, love her; it had been a horrible, wretched realisation. 
The Senshi of Time hadn&#39;t wanted to believe it at first of course, and 
had entered a state of denial that had lasted until... until only a few 
days ago. But Setsuna knew the cold hard truth now; she had always known 
somewhere in the back of her mind, though she had never had the courage 
to accept it. Everlasting loneliness was her fate. And no one escaped 
their fate, a fact she knew all too well now.

But then Rei had come and dared to challenge Destiny, and one of the 
most powerful and binding destinies there was no less, just to be with 
Usagi, the one she loved. It had been a futile effort Setsuna had first 
believed, but she had still hoped for the raven-haired girl&#39;s success 
despite herself. But it had all been for naught after all, ending in 
sorrow and confirming what the Guardian of Time had already known. 
Setsuna closed her jaded crimson eyes, banishing the sight of another 
fate in the making from her sight. She wished... the Senshi of Time 
shook her head gently. She wished for a lot of things, but it was a 
pointless endeavour. Wishes were for people who had a bright future, not 
for someone doomed from their very first breath.

On one of her many trips to the Guardian of Time&#39;s hospital room, 
Chibi-Usa had been noticeably agitated about Hotaru&#39;s safety, prompting 
kind words of reassurance and comfort from Setsuna. It seemed that 
nearly all of the Sailor Senshi, even the youngest ones, were finding 
companionship and love. The only ones left were Rei, Minako, and 
herself. All three senshi were in the same situation, but Minako 
appeared to handle her fate, or rather, her curse easier than the 
Guardian of Time and the miko. Minako had always been a light-hearted 
and fun-loving individual though, so perhaps her very nature made her 
future easier to bear. She wasn&#39;t like Setsuna and Rei.

Setsuna opened her eyes, returning them to the spectacle at Tokyo Tower 
she had already seen numerous times at her appointed post. Rei... she 
liked to think that they would have been good together. Setsuna would 
have treated the raven-haired beauty well, lavishing her with all sorts 
of kindness and affection. She would have given Rei her whole heart to 
hold. Though, Setsuna knew she had already done so. The Guardian of Time 
could have tempered the passionate miko&#39;s raging internal flames; she 
could have been the one to tame the raven-haired girl&#39;s fierce fire 
burning strongly in her heart. But the fires in Rei&#39;s heart only cooled 
for one person... and that person didn&#39;t even wish to embrace them. 
Setsuna would have gone on Rei&#39;s behalf to talk to Usagi, reasoned with 
the blonde, begged her even to not spurn the Fire Senshi&#39;s heart. She 
wanted to yell at the Moon Princess for being so foolish as to let such 
a wonderful person&#39;s intense love go to waste, and also ask how she 
could turn away from such fiery passion after basking in its heated 
flames for a time. But it would all have been useless. Fate had other 
plans for Usagi, tying her to Mamoru, Chibi-Usa, and Crystal Tokyo... 
and such a fate was the strongest Setsuna had ever encountered.

The image of Tokyo Tower and the dimensional gateway blurred in her eyes 
and the Guardian of Time swallowed the lump forming in her throat. She 
could have been the one to take all of Rei&#39;s pain away, if the girl had 
just let her try. Setsuna would have devoted her life to making the miko 
happy. But instead, Rei had opted to willingly spend eternity alone, 
merely loving Usagi silently from afar. Setsuna couldn&#39;t voluntarily 
welcome an existence like that. However, the fact that Rei could was a 
trait that made her admire and love the girl all the more. For Rei&#39;s 
heart to accept no other... her love for the princess must be strong 
indeed. But now, she was condemned like Setsuna, facing a future of 
never-ending loneliness... no... that was wrong.

Setsuna cleared her cloudy vision as the points of multicoloured light 
stopped appearing around the bottom of Tokyo Tower, just below the main 
observatory of the landmark. A future. The green-haired woman&#39;s grip on 
the bed sheets tightened, scrunching the material in her fists. She 
should have never had brought Rei back from Yokohama. Setsuna could have 
prevented everything then; all the pain the Fire Senshi had went through 
with Usagi, the damage it had caused between her friendships with 
Mamoru, Chibi-Usa, and the other Outer Senshi-- everything. But most 
importantly, Setsuna could have prevented what was about to happen 
tonight.

Setsuna smiled again, but his time somewhat bitterly. No, she knew that 
keeping Rei away from Tokyo, away from Usagi, wouldn&#39;t have worked in 
the end. The princess&#39;s life hanged in the balance, and if she were to 
meet her demise when Rei wasn&#39;t there to provide her with aid, it would 
have yielded the same result as if the Fire Senshi had died herself. 
Besides, Setsuna had seen the future. It was a gift that was more like a 
curse. Being able to see every variation of the future timeline 
practically took all of the surprises out of life, and not being able to 
speak of them made it worse. And if a thread of Time was shackled on a 
set path by a destiny, then all surprises were definitely gone. Just 
like the thread that Rei was travelling along this very night.

It was almost time now. Setsuna knew it for a fact. Her love was riding 
ever closer to the moment the Senshi of Time had already seen the 
outcome of. As soon as Rei had returned to Tokyo, her fate had been 
sealed. And what was Setsuna doing while the girl she loved deeply was 
charging blindly towards an unavoidable destiny with all her thoughts on 
protecting the Moon Princess? Sitting in a comfortable bed observing the 
event from a distance. The green-haired woman lowered her head in 
self-pity and loathing. She had *known*. She had known from the very 
start even before Rei had been buried alive in that clothing store, and 
yet still she did nothing. Setsuna had the power to change things; she 
had some control over Time. But there were rules, weren&#39;t there? Rules, 
rules, always rules. We can&#39;t interfere with the timeline, can we? The 
bedridden woman&#39;s fists clenched tighter, balling more of the blankets 
hard in her grip as her crimson eyes attempted to bore a hole through 
the bed. Can&#39;t interfere... all her power, and ultimately it was 
worthless. She couldn&#39;t even protect the one she loved. No, she 
*wouldn&#39;t* protect her. And Setsuna claimed to love Rei? While she sat 
in her cosy and secure bed doing absolutely nothing? The rules 
constraining her as the guardian of the Gates of Time didn&#39;t have any 
bearing when weighed against the safety of her love! Setsuna wanted to 
change Fate? Break it? Then she should break it with her own hands, not 
wait and pray for a mere *girl* to be successful doing it for her! God, 
she was a grown woman, a woman old enough to be that girl&#39;s great, 
great, great, grandmother, if not older! For once in her long life, 
Setsuna should take up the fight against Destiny herself, and prove it 
could be conquered after all!

Setsuna&#39;s head snapped up, and then she threw off the blankets, 
revealing her bandaged form, before swivelling her legs over the side of 
the bed and planting her feet firmly on the floor. She then stood up, 
her newly energised state of mind allowing her to distance herself from 
the sharp twinges of pain that ran up her legs and spine.

&quot;PLUTO PLANET POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;

Setsuna felt her hospital gown disintegrate from her body --the 
dressings on her numerous cut and stab wounds staying in place with a 
thought-- followed by her Sailor Senshi fuku wrapping around her mostly 
naked form as it materialised. The heavy weight of her Time Staff was 
then in her hands, the cool metal still able to be felt through the 
woman&#39;s white gloves. The newly transformed Sailor Pluto took a resolute 
step forward, resting only a small fraction of her mass on her weapon. 
She wobbled slightly on her feet, gripping her staff tightly in an 
attempt to retain her equilibrium, but managed to remain standing. 
Knowing that the time left to make any sort of decisive difference at 
Tokyo Tower was flittering away with every passing second, Pluto took 
another step, and then another, increasing her pace to a brisk walk.

And then suddenly, Sailor Pluto&#39;s weak legs gave way, buckling at the 
knees like soggy paper and depositing the woman hard on the floor in a 
kneeling position, jarring her injured body and sending acute needles of 
pain to shoot through her. No! She could do this, she could! She 
wouldn&#39;t let Rei down! Pluto gritted her teeth as she attempted to pull 
herself up using her staff, sweat beginning to break out on her 
forehead. The Senshi of Time&#39;s wounded body shuddered as she desperately 
tried to will her legs to work, mentally striving to infuse them with 
strength she knew deep down she didn&#39;t have. After a few seconds, Sailor 
Pluto&#39;s still-recovering body fell limp, totally drained of all of its 
energy. In a fit of frustrated anger, Pluto threw her Time Staff to one 
side with the remnants of her depleted strength, sending it spiralling 
along the floor to smash against the wall with a loud bang. It wasn&#39;t 
fair. It wasn&#39;t fair! Fate really was unbeatable. It had stopped her in 
her tracks before she even had a chance to act. And now Rei... but wait! 
Pluto could stop Time! Perhaps if she stopped it at just the right 
moment, she could... could what? She would have to be close enough to 
Tokyo Tower for Rei to not be affected by the halt in the flow of Time, 
so that the raven-haired girl could take advantage of it. The fact that 
Sailor Pluto would lose her life as a result of her blatantly violating 
the rules she was bound by never even occurred to the increasingly 
frantic woman. Or perhaps Pluto could simply use her communicator to 
warn Rei! ...No, the radio and television signals from Tokyo Tower would 
disrupt the transmission. Her efforts were hopeless. Fate had ensured 
Rei&#39;s path, it had began to carve it from the very instant the thought 
to leave Tokyo had entered the miko&#39;s mind. Pluto covered her face with 
one hand as the tears trembling in her eyes ran down her cheeks, leaving 
wet trails. There was nothing she could do. She was going to fail when 
Rei needed her most. Sailor Pluto blamed herself utterly. She had known 
what would happen, and yet she had simply sat and observed, nothing 
more. Further tears sprung to her eyes, seemingly inexhaustible as they 
streamed down her face and collected between the fingers of her hand, 
her body being wracked with heaving sobs. Her breathing was fast and 
shallow as she wept for the first time in hundreds of years, the agony 
of her duty, her loneliness, her *life* breaking past the dam she had 
built up over the long length time, destroying her resistance to the 
cruel reality of her painful existence. The Outer Sailor&#39;s fuku fell 
away from her, reverting her back to Setsuna, simply the lonely woman 
she was, trapped in an eternal cycle of pain as she cried for Rei, her 
love. She cursed herself for being so weak, and cursed whatever higher 
power had deemed it necessary for her to be the solitary Guardian of 
Time. And most of all she cursed Fate, for denying her the love she so 
yearned for.

******

&quot;We really don&#39;t have time for this...&quot; Sailor Mars growled out of the 
corner of her mouth to her comrades, not taking her eyes off the amassed 
youma enemy in front of her, while the other senshi covered her back. 
&quot;We have to get to the roof.&quot;

&quot;I remember seeing a maintenance ladder by the elevator when we first 
arrived,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen whispered from the Fire Senshi&#39;s right, his grip 
on this black cane tightening as the horde of youma tensed and began to 
slowly fan out, taking cautious and sure steps as they moved to 
circumspectly surround the Prince of Earth and the Sailor Senshi.

Mars risked flicking her eyes to the windows of Tokyo Tower&#39;s main 
observatory, catching a glimpse of the view before she returned them to 
her countless adversaries. In her fleeting look, she had observed a dark 
reddish patch hovering a short distance outside of the windows with 
currents of green, blue, and purple electricity crackling along its 
edge. Whatever that dark red smudge was floating in the air near the 
landmark, it was getting bigger, which couldn&#39;t possibly be a good 
thing. The Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen had to get up on the roof of 
the observatory and find out just what was going on, and then most 
likely put a stop to it.

Sailor Mars eyes narrowed to menacing slits at the youma. &quot;Usagi,&quot; she 
whispered to Sailor Moon on her left hand side, the raven-haired girl&#39;s 
lips barely moving. &quot;When I give the signal, run to the ladder on your 
left.&quot;

&quot;The ladder?&quot; Sailor Moon replied just as quietly. &quot;What ladder?&quot;

&quot;The ladder on your left!&quot; Sailor Mars repeated in low hiss.

&quot;Okay...&quot; the blonde odango atama whispered uncertainly. &quot;But what&#39;s the 
signal?&quot;

Mars&#39; mouth curled into a sinister grin, making the youma halt in their 
not-so-subtle manoeuvres. &quot;This! FIRE SOUL!&quot;

Suddenly a ball of flame erupted from the miko&#39;s fingertips, 
illuminating the interior of the observatory in a flash of bright light, 
temporarily blinding the host of youma before her. The sphere careered 
towards the temporarily stunned youma force and hit the nearest one 
before exploding, reducing the creature to chunks of gore and severely 
burning its nearby fellows.

&quot;RUN NOW!!&quot; Sailor Mars yelled out, turning to Sailor Moon and pushing 
her forwards with one hand on her back as the girl frantically ran for 
the maintenance ladder. She heard a shout from Sailor Neptune followed 
by a loud splash of water, the woman probably delivering her own form of 
distraction to the other half of the youma swarm.

Sailor Mars charged after her princess, hearing the fast beat of 
footsteps behind her that no doubt originated from Tuxedo Kamen, Sailor 
Venus, and the rest of the senshi. Sailor Moon reached the ladder a few 
feet from the elevator, and then jumped up on it, grabbing a rung with 
both hands and pulling herself up. Mars planted a helping hand on the 
blonde&#39;s behind as the girl struggled up the maintenance ladder, pushing 
her on her way and out of the danger area. Once Sailor Moon was two 
thirds of the way up the ladder, with Sailor Mercury climbing hot on her 
heels --the Senshi of Water only pausing to spare an anxious glance back 
at Jupiter on the floor-- Sailor Mars turned around back to the now 
enraged youma mob. To her rising dismay and distress, she saw that the 
dozens of youma had all been provoked by her and Neptune&#39;s attacks, the 
horde roused into brutal retaliation against them and the rest of their 
group. But the most alarming sight was Sailor Venus and Sailor Neptune 
standing steadfast in the middle of the two halves of the howling 
abominable monsters, the pair holding back the frenzied masses while 
Sailor Mars and the rest of their friends made their escape.

&quot;Michiru-mama!!&quot; Sailor Saturn screamed her aquamarine-haired guardian&#39;s 
name, pleading to her with her tone to come back to relative safety, 
while the woman in question launched a globe of blue-hued water at 
almost point blank range at a pack of bloodthirsty youma, destroying 
several and forcing many back in a hasty retreat.

&quot;Go on, Hotaru!&quot; the Senshi of the Ocean called, looking over her 
shoulder briefly at the young girl, before returning her attention to 
raining attack after attack upon the enemy, buying her friends more time 
to flee.

&quot;Yeah! Leave it to us!&quot; Venus joined in enthusiastically, after evading 
a fierce swipe of one creature&#39;s claw and blasting a smoking hole 
through the unfortunate thing&#39;s skull with a well-aimed energy beam as 
she nimbly darted away. The Senshi of Love then winked over her shoulder 
and flashed a V with the fingers of one hand at Saturn. &quot;This is when 
I&#39;m at my best!&quot;

&quot;And someone has to protect those two!&quot; Neptune cried above the din of 
otherworldly shrieks from the fighting and dying youma, and above the 
clamour of senshi powers being repeatedly invoked.

&quot;I think you&#39;d be mad if you&#39;re fan club were to end up food for youma, 
Mars!&quot; Venus added, referring to Tsubasa and the cowering Sanjuro still 
in the elevator, the pair both watching the unfolding events with 
anxious, fearful eyes.

&quot;Saturn, Mars, come on!&quot; Tuxedo Kamen yelled from the top of the 
maintenance ladder, spurring both Inner and Outer senshi into action, 
before he pulled himself up through the opening in the ceiling, the 
fluttering red and black tail of his cape the last thing Mars saw of the 
prince.

&quot;Up you go, Hotaru,&quot; Sailor Mars said to the Senshi of Rebirth, allowing 
the younger girl to climb the ladder up to the roof of the observatory 
first, before the miko herself followed suit, leaving behind Venus and 
Neptune as self-appointed rearguard. She gave one last look back at the 
pair of senshi and the overwhelming number of their opponents. Mars 
wasn&#39;t sure how long they would be able to hold out, if they even could 
at all. Her hopes and prayers with Sailor Venus and Sailor Neptune, the 
Fire Senshi clambered up the final rungs of the maintenance ladder and 
onto the roof of Tokyo Tower&#39;s primary observatory.

The first thing Sailor Mars noticed once she had stood up on the windy 
platform one hundred and fifty metres from the ground, was that it 
wasn&#39;t any less dangerous than the situation she and her friends had 
just took flight from under their feet, the vicious combat taking place 
below now barely even being heard over the fierce winds around them. 
Mars wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if there was even more youma up on top 
of the observatory than there were in it. The whole orange metal rooftop 
was absolutely covered with a huge crowd of the evil creatures... with 
more joining the congregation&#39;s ranks every second. The dark red rip 
haloed by sparking, vividly coloured, lightning bolts in the night&#39;s sky 
hanging before Tokyo Tower was now more like a deep weeping gash, 
bleeding youma instead of blood. All manner of creatures great and small 
were pouring at a steady rate out of the tear, leaping over the small 
gap between the tower&#39;s observatory roof and the opening in the sky, and 
some even flying over it on wings sprouting from their backs. If Sailor 
Mars squinted her eyes, she could make out a black rippling mass inside 
the dark red slash. It took the raven-haired girl a moment to grasp that 
the moving swarm was yet more youma, fervently waiting their turn to 
travel through the breach to her world.

&quot;A portal,&quot; Mars spat, as grim realisation finally dawned on her. It was 
an interdimensional portal, probably similar to the ones Khairephon and 
his vanquished siblings had used to bring their youma forces to the 
planet.

&quot;A portal?&quot; Sailor Mercury said curiously, gazing at the paranormal 
spectacle with renewed interest. &quot;So this is how so many youma have 
gotten to Tokyo,&quot; she said with newfound understanding, nodding her head 
unconsciously, agreeing with her own conclusion.

&quot;Among other things,&quot; Tuxedo Kamen murmured, the man no doubt thinking 
back to his rather unpleasant time in the demon Laodameia&#39;s captivity.

Suddenly, a man dressed in a dark blue business suit, whom Sailor Mars 
recognised as the youma who had made an attempt on Sailor Jupiter&#39;s life 
at Minato General Hospital several days ago, whirled around from 
watching the portal to the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen, his black 
ponytail whipping out behind him in the wind as his human-looking eyes 
widened almost imperceptibly. However, Mars wasn&#39;t sure, but the 
masquerading youma looked somewhat pleased that they were there for some 
unknown reason. Perhaps she was mistaken. Or perhaps the creature had a 
death wish.

&quot;You...&quot; the finely dressed youma said without inflection, his cold, 
even, voice somehow managing to reach the miko and her friends without 
being stolen by the raging winds.

&quot;You better believe it,&quot; Jupiter sneered, glaring hatefully at the 
creature and taking a threatening step forward, only to be restrained by 
a gentle touch on the arm by Mercury. Obviously the tall brunette had 
some score to settle with the onetime would-be youma assassin.

&quot;Ahh... what a surprise,&quot; said a low, deep, masculine voice. All eyes 
turned to the owner of the voice as he turned around from the gradually 
enlarging interdimensional gateway. He was a tall man --if he could be 
called a man-- perhaps about seven feet tall and was completely swathed 
in a rich dark garb, dressed akin to a European aristocrat during a time 
long past, the white plumb of a silk scarf at his neck the only hint of 
colour on his outfit besides deep black. A hooded cloak moved in tune 
with the currents of the night wind behind the figure, while two long 
grey locks of hair that almost reached his waist from beneath his hood 
flowed freely about also, riding the airwaves. A slender, slightly 
curved sword comparable to a katana hung at his waist, the shiny 
jet-black weapon heavily decorated with wicked serrated spikes around 
the hilt and handle, painting the blade in a positively fiendish light. 
An evil aura radiated from the katana, the presence of pure evil from 
the blade nearly tangible in the air to Sailor Mars&#39; attuned senses, the 
miko almost believing she could reach out and touch it if she were so 
inclined. &quot;I wasn&#39;t expecting the presence of the Sailor Senshi,&quot; the 
man continued, walking towards the assembled group a few steps. &quot;I take 
it the that the reception at my headquarters wasn&#146;t to your liking then? 
And here I had heard that Lazarus, the Night Haunter, could be such 
an... entertaining host.&quot;

&quot;Well, it was all fun and games until good ole&#39; Laz lost his party 
mask,&quot; Sailor Mars replied with heavy sarcasm, smirking derisively. &quot;And 
then things just got plain... *dead*, you know?&quot;

&quot;Such a shame...&quot; the blue suited youma murmured impassively, though the 
Fire Senshi was sure he meant the complete opposite.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Sailor Jupiter snarled, clenching her fists until her 
knuckles cracked audibly. &quot;You&#39;ll get to experience the same treatment 
soon enough...&quot;

The black-clad figure took another step forward, seeming to focus on 
Mars beneath his hood and ignoring all others, as if he was intently 
scrutinising her. &quot;You are she, aren&#39;t you? Sailor Mars...&quot; he said, 
stretching out the name of the miko&#39;s alter-ego. &quot;You are... different, 
than I had believed you would be in person.&quot;

&quot;So you know me,&quot; Mars deadpanned, obviously not caring one bit. &quot;My 
reputation precedes me I suppose.&quot;

&quot;Yes...&quot; the tall dark figure replied, his tone almost taking on a 
bitter sneer. &quot;But where are my manners?&quot; He gestured to the youma with 
the ponytail nearby with one hand. &quot;This is my associate, Iason,&quot; he 
said in a slightly patronising tone as he introduced the creature. &quot;And 
I...&quot; The shadowy figure grabbed the top of his hood with one hand and 
pulled it back, revealing his face. Or rather, *faces*. &quot;I am Makareus.&quot;

Sailor Mars swallowed a little uneasily as it became evident that 
Makareus was in actual fact the final remaining demon of the four who 
had chosen to invade the planet. But the thing that was most unnerving 
was what the creature&#39;s hood had hidden. As Mars and her friends watched 
with slowly growing apprehension, Makareus&#39; face *changed* with every 
passing second, going through a constant cycle of masquerades, each one 
different that the last, some more so than others. At one moment, his 
face was that of a nondescript man, and then an instant later it was 
covered with a multitude of eyes, each blinking in unison. At another 
moment, the demon&#39;s features turned bestial, becoming like that of a 
ravenous wolf&#39;s, drool dripping from his open maw. And so the cycle of 
faces continued, never letting up for a second as they masked Makareus&#39; 
turn visage... if the demon even had one.

Sailor Moon blinked a few times, and then after visually recovering from 
the bizarre sight of Makareus&#39; thousand faces, she steeled herself, her 
Spiral Heart Moon Rod appearing in one hand in a burst of glittering 
light. &quot;For love and justice, I&#39;m the pretty senshi Sailor Moon!&quot; she 
declared, pointing challengingly at the tall, intimidating, demon with 
her Moon Rod. &quot;And in place of the moon, I will punish you!&quot;

Makareus stared levelly at Sailor Moon with his ever-changing eyes, 
clearly not at all impressed. However, a slow, calculating smile began 
to grow on his features, the devious grin carrying over to every 
different face. The demon then looked at Sailor Mars, his smile 
increasing even more as his eyes began to narrow in a cunning, 
portentous, way. And then, without any warning whatsoever, Makareus&#39; arm 
flashed to the belt around his waist in a lightning quick blur of 
motion, Mars&#39; eyes having tremendous difficultly following the fast 
movement. The miko saw a glint of metal, the light from the floodlights 
of Tokyo Tower reflecting off the steel and to her lavender eyes. 
Suddenly, Sailor Mars knew, as if divine inspiration sent from the gods 
themselves had hit her, that this exact time, this exact *moment* was 
the one she had been dreading from the very instant Setsuna had warned 
her about it. Time stretched out, slowing to but a crawl as Sailor Mars&#39; 
wide, seriously alarmed amethyst eyes watched as Makareus bent down into 
a low stance as he pulled out a razor-sharp dagger, a tanto, from his 
waist and drew his arm back, the lethal pointed tip aimed straight for 
Sailor Moon.

&quot;BOYAKERU SHADOU ATEMI!&quot;

Sailor Mars&#39; feet felt rooted to the rooftop as the demon took his first 
step in his furious charge, multiple dark, shadowy afterimages of 
himself streaming out behind him in his wake. Makareus&#39; deadly dagger 
led the way while he screamed a battle cry, the words sounding to come 
out lethargically to the Fire Senshi&#39;s ears, as if each syllable was 
lengthened a vast extent, like a stretched out audiotape. She heard her 
comrades shouting out around her, their words unintelligible gibberish 
to her. Sailor Mars stared at the unstoppable rush of Makareus, not 
blinking, feeling distanced from her body, as if she were watching the 
scene from far away. And then, without fanfare, without so much as a 
proverbial bolt of lightning striking her from the heavens above, Sailor 
Mars finally knew her purpose for coming back to Tokyo. What had always 
been her purpose. The understanding came gently, calmly, and clearly to 
her mind. It had always been so simple. Everything else that had 
happened since returning to Tokyo; the attempt to defeat Fate, her 
short-lived romantic relationship with her princess, *everything*... it 
didn&#39;t matter. In a way, it never had. This moment was the reason she 
had come, this single moment in time was the only reason.

Sailor Mars willed her feet to move, breaking into a run that was the 
longest in all her life, her prior hesitation not summing to even so 
much as a fraction of a second in reality. Each footfall came slowly, 
languidly, racing against Makareus&#39; in a sluggish contest, as if both 
competitors were sprinting through mud. There was a loud, heartfelt, 
desperate cry from her left, but the senshi ignored it, utterly focused 
on her final, most important task of her existence, the reason she was 
born in this world. And as Sailor Mars darted in front of Sailor Moon, 
Makareus&#39; glinting blade driving hard in her stomach in a mortal blow, 
she at long last realised she had been deluding herself. She had never 
defended her princess out of duty, never out of obligation or 
responsibility; it had always been out of love.

Sailor Mars pushed her stomach out to take Makareus&#39; tanto fully in her 
body, protecting her princess from it erupting out of her back and 
piercing the girl. She looked down at the dagger disappearing halfway 
into her abdomen. There wasn&#39;t any pain, but she felt... sad, that it 
had to end like this. Empty, that she would no longer be by Sailor 
Moon&#39;s side, basking in the loving glow that always shown from the 
angelic girl. But there was also a sense of satisfaction, of knowing 
that in her death, she had given Sailor Moon life. Sailor Mars smiled 
faintly as the memories of her Fire vision came back to her mind. So 
that was what it had meant. She now knew what the feeling of absence in 
her prediction was. The absence was her.

Author&#39;s ramblings:

Minako&#39;s curse Setsuna was thinking about refers to the curse she 
received from Saijou Ace during her time as Sailor V to only have her 
duty to protect Usagi, and never have love.

I wrote Makareus&#39; attack in Japanese since all the senshi&#39;s were in 
English. I don&#39;t know, I just felt like doing that. What the attack 
translates to isn&#39;t really important.

And on a final note... it&#39;s good to be evil. ^_^</pre>
