Tokyo, near her parents.

    Rap rap rap rap!
    &#147;Come in,&#148; Usagi said, nervously smoothing her black wool skirt.  
She had her long pink hair done up in its usual odango style, but with 
two long thin braids, one in front of each ear.  Variety could be a 
good thing, after all.  She hoped that one person would notice.
    Rei opened the door.  &#147;Konbonwa, Usa-chan,&#148; she said happily.  
&#147;Ooh, I like your hair.&#148;
    &#147;Arigatou, Rei-sempai,&#148; the younger lady said.  She and Rei drew 
nearer to each other and met in a brief but passionate kiss.  &#147;This 
will be our first dance as a couple.  After tonight, everyone will 
know about us.&#148;
    &#147;I&#146;ve always wanted to dance with you, Usagi; this is going to be 
a terrific night.  Before we dance, though, there are some people we 
should tell.  We owe it to them.&#148;  The fire priestess paused.  &#147;The 
queen and king know, ne?&#148;
    &#147;Well,&#148; Usagi said with a sweatdrop, &#147;I never actually told 
Serenity, but she&#146;s got to know.  We haven&#146;t been hiding from her.  As 
for Daddy&#133;&#148;
    &#147;&#133;Endymion doesn&#146;t know, does he?&#148;
    &#147;He might: Mom might have told him.&#148;
    &#147;Okay,&#148; Rei sighed.  &#147;We both know how likely that is.  We&#146;ll tell 
Endymion first.  We should also let Setsuna, Haruka, Michiru, and 
Makoto know.&#148;
    &#147;It&#146;s a short list, but I&#146;m nervous.  Setsuna&#146;s like a mother to 
me, Endymion is my dad, and Haruka&#146;s sure to tease us mercilessly.&#148;
    &#147;So we know what to expect!&#148;
    &#147;True.  Well, shall we go?&#148; Usagi asked.
    Rei offered the ruby-eyed woman her arm.  &#147;I&#146;d be honored, my 
Princess,&#148; she said.
    The two young ladies walked to the crystal portal, clasped each 
other&#146;s hands, and envisioned the ballroom.  Soft lights of many 
colors whirled around them and they arrived in an instant, standing on 
the ancient marble floor.
    &#147;We&#146;re a little early,&#148; Rei observed.  &#147;I don&#146;t see your mother 
and father yet.  Where would they be?&#148;
    &#147;This way,&#148; Usagi said, taking Rei&#146;s hand again.  &#147;If I know them 
at all, they&#146;ll be getting dressed to the nines.&#148;  Rei and Usagi 
proceeded down the corridor that led to the queen and king&#146;s wing.  
The attendant at their chamber door immediately recognized Usagi and 
Rei and gave them the proper greeting, then announced them to the 
queen.
    &#147;Usagi!  Rei!&#148; Serenity exclaimed when she saw the couple.  She 
finished clasping a silver necklace and approached them.  &#147;I hope that 
the two of you have patched up your differences?&#148;
    Usagi sweatdropped again and smiled apologetically.  &#147;It&#146;s great 
to see you, oka-san,&#148; she said, hugging the queen.
    &#147;Yes, it&#146;s great to see you again, Serenity-sama,&#148; Rei said, 
hugging her in turn.  &#147;And hai, we aren&#146;t angry with each other 
anymore.&#148;
    &#147;We&#146;re here as girlfriends, in fact,&#148; Usagi finished.  &#147;We wanted 
to tell you before the dance started.&#148;
    &#147;Wow,&#148; Serenity gasped, taken aback.  &#147;I guess you did make up!  
How long have you two been an item?&#148;
    &#147;Since that night&#133;I thought you&#146;d know, Mom; I&#146;m sorry I didn&#146;t 
tell you earlier.&#148;
    &#147;Hah hah hah, I should have known!  It&#146;s not your fault.  Forget 
all that, though; you two look great together.  Who else have you 
told?&#148; Serenity asked.
    &#147;Considering what I accidentally overheard just now, me,&#148; Endymion 
said, entering the queen&#146;s dressing room.
    &#147;Endymion-sama, it&#146;s good to see you,&#148; Rei said smoothly.  &#147;We 
were just about to tell you.&#148;
    &#147;Oto-san, I&#146;m glad you&#146;re back from Earth,&#148; Usagi said happily.  
&#147;I guess you know, but let me say it anyway.  I&#146;m going out with Rei.&#148;
    &#147;If you&#146;re happy, I&#146;m happy,&#148; he replied.  &#147;I admit, I&#146;m a bit 
surprised, but Rei is&#133;good for you.&#148;
    &#147;Arigatou.&#148;  Rei was blushing slightly.
    &#147;So who else have you told?&#148; Serenity repeated.
    &#147;Actually, just Hotaru,&#148; Usagi said.
    &#147;But Minako and Ami also know,&#148; Rei added.  &#147;They were indirectly 
involved.  Even if they hadn&#146;t been, Minako is quite in tune with all 
our feelings.  And whatever she knows, Ami knows of course.&#148;
    &#147;Let&#146;s go to the dance,&#148; Serenity suggested.  &#147;We can talk more 
later.  Right now, I want to party!&#148;

*****

    Usagi and Rei looked for their still uninformed friends as soon as 
they reached the ballroom, but a quick search didn&#146;t produce any of 
them.  The band started playing.
    &#147;I&#146;m sure they&#146;ll be along,&#148; Rei said with certainty.  &#147;May I have 
this dance, my dearest Princess Usa-chan?&#148;
    &#147;I&#146;m yours,&#148; Usagi responded.
    The song was slow and touching.  Rei and Usagi seemed to hold one 
another in trance.  Each young woman seemed soundly lost in the 
other&#146;s eyes.  &#147;How many people have ever seen this charming side of 
you?&#148;  Usagi finally murmured.
    &#147;Only you,&#148; Rei whispered back.  &#147;This side of me doesn&#146;t exist if 
anyone else is around.  You create this version of me.&#148;
    &#147;That&#146;s the kindest thing I&#146;ve ever been told,&#148; the pink-haired 
lady sighed, resting her cheek on Rei&#146;s chest for a moment.
    &#147;It&#146;s the truth&#151;the wonderful truth of who you are.  You can work 
miracles.&#148;
    The contented couple swayed to the music until it faded away.  Rei 
curiously looked over the party guests.  &#147;There&#146;s Setsuna,&#148; she said, 
pointing.
    &#147;Good.  Let&#146;s go talk to her,&#148; Usagi said, keeping her worries out 
of her voice.
    &#147;Setsuna-san, good evening,&#148; Rei greeted the senshi of time.
    &#147;Hi, Setsuna!&#148; Usagi echoed.  &#147;You&#146;re looking great!&#148;
    &#147;Oh, good evening, Princess!  Good evening, Rei-chan!  Are you two 
having fun?&#148;  Setsuna seemed a little disconcerted at the sight of 
them and that confused Rei.
    &#147;Rei and I have something to tell you.  We&#146;re dating,&#148; Usagi 
blurted eagerly.
    &#147;Are you?&#148;  Setsuna temporarily forgot all her courtesy and stared 
at the pair.  &#147;Gomen!  Gomen nasai&#151;that&#146;s great news.  I&#146;m happy for 
you.&#148;
    &#147;Nani?&#148; Rei asked.  &#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148;
    &#147;Nothing&#146;s wrong.  I just wasn&#146;t expecting&#133;that you two would get 
together.  That&#146;s all.&#148;
    &#147;We surprised you?  Rei-sempai, we&#146;re already doing incredible 
things together!&#148;
    &#147;Hai,&#148; Rei laughed, her genki tone disguising the general unease 
she suddenly felt.  &#147;Setsuna, did you come by yourself?&#148;
    &#147;No, I came with the Outers and Iori-san,&#148; the tall woman answered 
absently.
    &#147;Iori-san?&#148; Usagi inquired.
    &#147;He&#146;s a friend,&#148; Setsuna said too quickly.
    Rei and Usagi looked meaningfully at each other.  &#147;And how good a 
&#145;friend&#146; is he?&#148; Usagi pressed slyly.
    Setsuna&#146;s cheeks grew darker.  &#147;A pretty good friend,&#148; she 
muttered.  &#147;You&#151;&#147;
    &#147;No need to explain.  Way to go, Setsuna!&#148; Usagi said, nudging Rei 
with her elbow.
    Setsuna&#146;s blush deepened.  &#147;Heh heh,&#148; she chuckled, trying to 
cover her embarrassment.  &#147;Speaking of whom, I&#146;ll bet he&#146;s waiting for 
me.  I should be going, but I&#146;ll see you later tonight.&#148;
    &#147;Could you tell us where Michiru and Haruka are before you go?&#148; 
Rei asked sweetly.
    &#147;I think they were near the lotus pond.&#148;
    &#147;Thanks,&#148; Usagi said.
    Rei and Usagi headed toward the pond.  &#147;Makes sense that they&#146;d be 
there,&#148; Rei remarked.  &#147;Michiru loves water and they both appreciate 
the beauty of the flowers.&#148;
    Setsuna was right.  Michiru and Haruka were sitting on the short 
wooden bridge that spanned the narrow part of the long pond.  They 
were talking and swirling their feet in the water; their shoes sat 
near them.  Rei and Usagi called to them and the four women exchanged 
greetings.
    &#147;We&#146;ve got some news for you,&#148; Rei told them.
    &#147;Oh?&#148; Michiru asked mildly.
    &#147;I hope it&#146;s good news,&#148; Haruka said.
    &#147;Rei is my girlfriend.  This is our first dance,&#148; Usagi informed 
them with a huge smile.
    &#147;That&#146;s terrific,&#148; Michiru responded.  &#147;If you hadn&#146;t found a 
significant other soon, Usagi, Haruka and I were going to start 
setting you up with people.&#148;
    &#147;It will be difficult,&#148; Haruka sighed.
    &#147;What will?&#148; Usagi asked.
    &#147;Deciding which of you makes me more jealous,&#148; the powerful senshi 
answered, grinning like a wolf.
    &#147;Now, now,&#148; Michiru chided jokingly.  &#147;You&#146;ve got to set a good 
example for our two young lovers, dear.&#148;
    &#147;Are you saying that Usagi isn&#146;t genki and beautiful?  Are you 
implying that Rei isn&#146;t sexy and smart?  Are you telling me that you 
couldn&#146;t picture yourself with either of them?  Or both of them?&#148;
    Rei and Usagi turned bright red.  Usagi decided to return fire, 
though.  &#147;You&#146;re strong and kawaii yourself, Haruka.  Now that you 
bring it up, I can see me and you, and/or Michiru&#133;but Rei and I 
together is my favorite picture; she is quite sexy, as you said.&#148;
    &#147;Usagi!&#148;  &#147;Usa-chan!&#148;  &#147;Princess!&#148; all three scandalized women 
protested.
    Usagi laughed at their amazement.  The other women started 
laughing, too.
    &#147;She&#146;s a match for you, Haruka-chan,&#148; Rei said.  &#147;For an instant, 
you were as red as I&#146;ve ever seen you!&#148;
    &#147;Bold and a quick thinker,&#148; Michiru approved.  &#147;I&#146;ll bet you&#146;re 
great on your feet as well.  We&#146;re going to head back to the dance, 
are you?&#148;
    &#147;I think we ought to,&#148; Usagi said.
    &#147;Yes,&#148; Rei nodded.  &#147;We need to find Makoto.  She&#146;s the only 
senshi who doesn&#146;t know about us yet.  Plus, I love dancing with 
Usagi.&#148;  She put her arm around the pink-haired girl&#146;s shoulders and 
squeezed her gently.
    &#147;You&#146;re just too cute for words,&#148; Haruka chuckled as she watched 
them.
    The four senshi walked back to the dancehall, chatting as they 
went.  A fast song was playing.  Michiru winked at Rei and Usagi and 
pulled Haruka closer to the center of the room.  Usagi grabbed Rei&#146;s 
hand and led her into the lively dance.  The princess made sure that 
she rubbed against her partner at every chance.  Rei said nothing, but 
she seemed to be enjoying this form of teasing.  Her own moves grew 
bolder and her eyes gleamed wickedly.
    When the song ended, both young women were flushed and happy.  
They renewed their leisurely search for Makoto.  After a few moments, 
Usagi noticed her entering the hall through its main doors.  
&#147;Something must&#146;ve kept her,&#148; Usagi reasoned.  &#147;Shall we go?&#148;
    The tall brunette spotted them before they reached her.  She 
smiled and waited for them to join her.  When they did, she greeted 
them with huge hugs.  Usagi asked Makoto what had happened to make her 
late and Makoto grimaced.
    &#147;Let me put it this way: I&#146;m no diplomat,&#148; she said sourly.  &#147;From 
here on out, I hope not to be on any missions that involve embassies.&#148;
    &#147;Sounds rough,&#148; Rei said.  &#147;All you want is a healthy fight and 
you&#146;re supposed to talk instead&#133;&#148;
    &#147;&#133;Sarcasm from you, Rei-chan?  At least I know you aren&#146;t an 
impostor,&#148; Makoto replied.  &#147;But seriously, I love seeing both of you 
so happy!&#148;
    &#147;There&#146;s a reason for that,&#148; Usagi said.  &#147;Rei and I are an 
official couple now.&#148;
    &#147;That explains why she&#146;s happy, but why are you?&#148;
    &#147;Hey!&#148; Rei objected, almost laughing.
    &#147;Couldn&#146;t resist,&#148; Makoto joked.  &#147;I&#146;m happy for you girls.  
Usagi, I admit that I was afraid you&#146;d start dating some unworthy 
baka; it&#146;s nice to know that you didn&#146;t.&#148;
    &#147;It&#146;s &#145;nice&#146; that I didn&#146;t?  You don&#146;t understand!  Rei could be 
the champion kisser of the galaxy.  Being with anyone else would be a 
catastrophe,&#148; Usagi told Makoto.
    &#147;Really?&#148; the senshi of thunder asked, eyebrows raised.  Rei was 
blushing but she couldn&#146;t think of anything to say.  The introduction 
to another piece of music began to play, saving the fire priestess 
from whatever comment Makoto would have made next.
    &#147;The next dance is about to start,&#148; Rei said hurriedly.  &#147;Are you 
tired, love; do you want to sit this one out?&#148;
    &#147;Not on your life!&#148; Usagi answered predictably.  &#147;I don&#146;t want to 
miss even one.&#148;  She turned to Makoto, who was trying hard to hide her 
laughter.  &#147;I don&#146;t want to be rude&#151;&#147;
    &#147;&#151;Nonsense, you&#146;re being nothing of the sort.  You have fun with 
your girlfriend and I&#146;ll see you soon, okay?&#148;
    &#147;You bet, Makoto-chan.  Ja ne!&#148; Usagi replied cheerily.
    &#147;Stay out of trouble, Makoto,&#148; Rei laughed.  Makoto pulled down 
her eyelid and stuck out her tongue.
    It was another slow song and Rei took the lead.  She and Usagi 
whispered to each other.  &#147;That went well,&#148; Rei said, an enchanting 
smile on her face.
    &#147;People seem to think that we&#146;re perfect for each other,&#148; Usagi 
said dreamily.  &#147;I don&#146;t always agree with people, but this time 
they&#146;re right.&#148;
    &#147;Here and now, moving this way, feeling how wonderful it is to 
hold you in my arms&#151;perfect doesn&#146;t seem to cover it.&#148;  Rei bent 
forward slightly and her lips met Usagi&#146;s.  The music kept playing.

*****

    They were the last couple to leave the dance floor.  Arm-in-arm, 
they strolled to the crystal portal, where they joined hands and 
traveled to Usagi&#146;s suite in the gigantic Imperial Palace.
    Usagi let one of Rei&#146;s hands go, but clasped the other earnestly.  
&#147;Would you like to come in for a while, Rei?&#148; she asked bashfully, her 
ruby eyes barely meeting Rei&#146;s violet eyes.
    &#147;Princess, I would like that very much,&#148; Rei replied.  Usagi 
beamed, wrapping Rei in comfortable warmth.
    &#147;What kind of tea would you like?&#148; Usagi asked her girlfriend as 
they entered the large yet cozy dwelling.
    &#147;Usa-chan, you look dead on your feet,&#148; Rei chided.  &#147;It&#146;s time to 
admit that you&#146;re worn out, lie down on one of your sofas, and let me 
get the drinks.&#148;
    &#147;That would make me about the moon&#146;s worst hostess,&#148; Usagi 
objected.
    &#147;Arguing with someone you know is right and not accepting help 
when it&#146;s offered&#151;these are much worse than letting someone else make 
tea!  So what would you like?&#148;
    Usagi laughed softly.  &#147;Arigatou.  Cocoa, please.&#148;
    &#147;Coming up.&#148;
    Usagi allowed herself to relax into her huge crimson sofa.  
Concentrating for a moment, she brought up a fire in the wide brick 
fireplace.  Then she lay back, closing her eyes for a minute, and 
listened to Rei bustling about her kitchen.  When she could hear the 
priestess approaching, she opened her eyes and sat up.  She didn&#146;t 
want Rei to think she was more tired than she actually was.
    &#147;It smells great,&#148; Usagi praised.
    &#147;I hope it tastes as good,&#148; Rei said humbly, handing Usagi a warm 
mug.  She sat near her girlfriend and they sipped their drinks 
quietly, neither really saying anything.
    Eventually, Usagi set down her cup and Rei took the tea service 
into the kitchen.  She returned to the couch quickly and sat very, 
very close to Usagi.  &#147;Lie down,&#148; she invited.  Usagi laid her head in 
Rei&#146;s lap and Rei gently stroked her long pink hair.  Usagi almost 
purred.  &#147;You&#146;re a wonderful dancer and a fantastic girlfriend,&#148; Rei 
told her.  &#147;You&#146;re pulling me deeper in love with you every moment 
you&#146;re near.&#148;
    &#147;Loving you more than I do shouldn&#146;t even be possible.  But you 
make it possible, Rei-sama.  You&#146;re more than I deserve.&#148;
    Rei took a deep breath.  &#147;Let me help you relax,&#148; she said.  &#147;Just 
be still, I&#146;ve got you.&#148;  She unbuttoned Usagi&#146;s blouse, carefully 
removed it from her torso, then undid the clasp on her bra and removed 
that too.  Rei had studied massage techniques for years, now she 
worked with utmost skill.  Her hands soothed Usagi&#146;s tired body: first 
her neck, then her shoulders, her right arm then her left arm, next 
her upper chest, her breasts, her ribs, and finally her abdomen.  The 
touch was healing, refreshing, and too caring to be erotic.  Still, 
Usagi&#146;s heart and lungs worked faster while Rei&#146;s hands rubbed her 
upper body.
    &#147;Turn over, darling,&#148; Rei bid her young girlfriend.  Usagi did so, 
with a speed that betrayed how eager she was for the massage to 
continue.  Rei undid Usagi&#146;s odangos, brushed her hair out with her 
fingers, then began to knead Usagi&#146;s back.  As Rei progressed lower, 
she dragged her hair lightly across Usagi&#146;s skin, and she noticed the 
girl shiver with delight.  She opened the zip on Usagi&#146;s skirt and 
pulled the garment slowly off her.  Then she removed Usagi&#146;s 
stockings, garters, and finally panties.  Now the ruby-eyed princess 
was lying totally naked on the expansive sofa, completely vulnerable 
to Rei&#146;s touch.  The flame senshi continued her meticulous rubdown.  
She attended to Usagi&#146;s lower back, buttocks, thighs, knees, calves, 
heels, soles, and toes each in turn.  Usagi felt at peace.  She hated 
the absence of Rei&#146;s hands when they left her.
    &#147;Turn back over,&#148; Rei urged.  &#147;How do you feel?&#148;
    As Usagi lay there, nude and relaxed, with her head in Rei&#146;s lap 
once again, she was nearly overwhelmed.  &#147;I feel in love,&#148; she 
answered quietly.  She wasn&#146;t a bit embarrassed; she was comfortable 
with her state of undress in Rei&#146;s presence.
    &#147;You&#146;re incredibly beautiful, Usa-chan.  But it&#146;s your angelic 
personality that I&#146;ve fallen in love with.  When I&#146;m with you, I&#146;m a 
stronger, better person.  You&#146;re the only one I&#146;ve ever really loved.  
Nothing before was real, you&#146;ve shown me that.&#148;
    Usagi closed her eyes.  Her voice trembled.  &#147;Rei-chan, Rei&#133;I want 
so much to make love to you&#133;&#148;
    &#147;&#133;Why don&#146;t you?&#148; Rei asked in a whisper.
    &#147;Because you said you weren&#146;t ready and I refuse to rush you.  
You&#146;re worth the wait, even if it takes forever.  Once you let me know 
that you&#146;re r&#151;&#147;
    Usagi was cut off by Rei&#146;s tongue in her mouth, seeking to embrace 
hers.  Her fingers and palms roamed Usagi&#146;s body and this time the 
touch was sensual and energizing.  This time, Usagi writhed under 
Rei&#146;s busy hands; she couldn&#146;t stay still.  This time, Usagi touched 
back&#151;
    --With vehemence!
    The lithe, pink-haired woman rolled Rei onto her back and caught 
her with one knee on either side of her waist.  She heard Rei gasp at 
the swiftness and power in the motions.  She kept her mouth on Rei&#146;s 
while her hands tore feverishly at Rei&#146;s dress and undergarments.  She 
had the taller woman naked in an instant.  She felt Rei recovering 
from the shock of her passionate assault, felt Rei putting her hands 
on her shoulders.  Usagi wasn&#146;t having that.  A discarded article of 
clothing seemed to jump into her grasp.  She kissed Rei with 
insatiable thirst as her lightning-quick hands bound Rei&#146;s wrists.  
Usagi reluctantly took her lips from Rei&#146;s and spoke into Rei&#146;s ear.  
&#147;You&#146;ve taken care of me my whole life.  Now I&#146;m going to take care of 
you and even you won&#146;t interfere, Hino Rei.&#148;  The black-haired 
priestess shivered at the words; she knew that Usagi meant them.
    Usagi kissed Rei&#146;s neck and ears; she let her hands wander slowly 
over Rei&#146;s magnificent body.  Usagi paid close attention to Rei&#146;s 
responses when her touch drifted to various places.  The violet-eyed 
woman seemed to enjoy light caresses of the undersides of her breasts 
and quick kisses on the sides of her neck and on her exquisite 
nipples.  Usagi experimented more and found that licking Rei&#146;s navel 
drove her wild.  Usagi took advantage of Rei&#146;s near-helplessness by 
turning around quickly, gaining access to Rei&#146;s lower body.
    &#147;Princess!&#148; Rei gasped at the feeling of Usagi&#146;s lips and teeth 
making contact with her inner thigh.
    &#147;Love it when you call me that,&#148; Usagi mumbled.  Rei had already 
passed squirming; she was thrashing now.  Usagi began to tantalize her 
with her tongue and fingers.  She lavished attention on Rei&#146;s thighs, 
hips, and belly.  She neglected her damp, shaven delta.  Rei was 
definitely ready and willing&#151;some of her juice was dripping onto the 
sofa cushions&#151;but Usagi wanted her to ask for it.
    Rei was beside herself.  The pleasure was intense but her body 
cried out for more.  It was almost as though Usagi was purposely 
keeping her from ecstasy&#151;and then Rei understood!
    &#147;You want&#133;me to beg for it&#133;ne?  I&#146;ve never&#133;begged&#133;for anything!  
Do your worst!  I can take it,&#148; she challenged as well as she could.
    It&#146;s a contest now, Usagi thought wickedly.  She pushed Rei&#146;s 
thighs further apart and used her tongue to forcefully stroke the 
sensitive spot between Rei&#146;s lower lips and her anus.  She ran her 
fingers along Rei&#146;s legs very gently, making small circles.  She 
stopped licking just long enough to talk.  &#147;I&#146;m your princess and you 
will ask nicely for it!&#148; she taunted.  She immediately dove between 
Rei&#146;s legs again.
    Rei bit her lip.  Her will lasted for what seemed like forever, 
but was actually less than ten seconds.  Usagi&#146;s torture was just too 
much.
    &#147;Please!  Usagi-sama!&#148;
    Usagi pushed her middle finger deep into Rei and kept kissing 
Rei&#146;s inner thighs.  Rei&#146;s breath caught as her pleasure increased 
dramatically.  Her lungs struggled for more air; her hips moved on 
their own.  Her mind refused to think of anything but the immense 
sensations that rocked her and her love for the person who was 
responsible.  Usagi kept varying her tactics, creating new feelings, 
each bringing her closer to her goal.  Usagi spread Rei&#146;s labia with 
her fingers and drove her tongue into Rei&#146;s delicious vagina.  She 
lapped with energy, seeming to know how close Rei was to the edge.  As 
splendid as Usagi&#146;s fingers had been, Rei liked her tongue even 
better.  She tensed suddenly and bliss engulfed her.  During Rei&#146;s 
climax, Usagi kept her tongue in motion.  Using some dormant instinct, 
Rei called to the fire that burned in the room.  As she hit her peak, 
it lashed out for her and charred the garment that bound her.  Without 
knowing how or why, Rei was suddenly free.
    As she was slowly descending from her pinnacle, she became aware 
of her freedom of motion.  She paused and released a heartfelt 
moan&#151;Usagi&#146;s thumb was grazing her clitoris.  Clearly, the ruby-eyed 
girl intended to give her another orgasm.  Usagi&#146;s other hand traveled 
up and began carefully fondling Rei&#146;s chest.  The black-haired woman 
realized that her next orgasm was close.  She wanted to give back to 
her lover.  With one hand busy on Rei&#146;s breasts and the other on her 
swollen clitoris, Usagi shifted and started licking Rei&#146;s navel again.  
Rei was glad that she hadn&#146;t been standing, for she&#146;d have fallen when 
pleasure weakened her momentarily.  The second climax seemed more 
powerful than the first.  Though it was almost impossible to draw a 
breath, Rei managed to coo Usagi&#146;s name.  The pink-haired princess 
nearly burst with love and pride when she heard it.
    Abruptly, Usagi felt Rei&#146;s hands on her hips.  Rei was supposed to 
be her prisoner!  The fire priestess and the moon princess grappled 
(somewhat awkwardly) for the advantage, no matter how fleeting it 
might be.  Somehow, Usagi managed to turn around and grab Rei&#146;s 
wrists.  Rei bucked violently until it became clear that she wasn&#146;t 
going to be able to throw Usagi that way.
    &#147;An attempted escape?&#148; Usagi joked breathlessly.  &#147;It didn&#146;t work.  
Do you admit it?&#148;
    &#147;Yes,&#148; Rei said grudgingly.
    Usagi leaned forward.  She and Rei kissed passionately.  &#147;Your 
invincible spirit&#151;you&#146;re so unbelievably beautiful, Rei-chan.&#148;
    &#147;My lovely Usa-chan&#133;&#148; Rei answered, starry-eyed.
    &#147;But you&#146;ve still got to be punished!&#148; Usagi said gleefully.  
&#147;Turn over.&#148;
    The &#147;spanking&#148; that followed only served to arouse both women 
further.  Rei wiggled provocatively; Usagi kept her hand on Rei&#146;s 
shapely rear for much longer than she needed.  Before long, she was 
actively rubbing, and straying to other parts of Rei&#146;s anatomy.  She 
gently pushed Rei&#146;s trembling legs wide open and eased her index and 
middle fingers between her wet labia.  Rei hissed but said 
nothing&#151;this was her &#147;punishment,&#148; after all.  Usagi planted light 
kisses on Rei&#146;s smooth back, pumping all the while.  Rei&#146;s sweaty body 
shuddered as she came again and Usagi finally withdrew her hands and 
mouth from her beloved.  She lay on the huge sofa next to Rei.  
Priestess and princess embraced and kissed.
    &#147;Aishiteru forever,&#148; Rei whispered.  &#147;I never imagined how good 
that would be.&#148;
    &#147;Aishiteru.  I told you that I would take care of you.&#148;
    &#147;Come sit in my lap, Princess,&#148; Rei invited.
    Usagi hurried to do so.  Rei&#146;s long fingers played with her fine 
pink hair.  Usagi felt herself being lulled by the rhythmic, relaxing 
motions.  She felt Rei&#146;s breath against her ear.
    &#147;Now I&#146;m going to make love to you,&#148; the violet-eyed woman 
murmured.  Her hands left Usagi&#146;s hair.  One came to rest on her 
chest, the other on her thigh.  She started delicately caressing 
Usagi&#146;s pert breasts, playfully pinching the sensitive nipples now and 
then.  Rei&#146;s other hand sought out Usagi&#146;s wet vagina and slowly 
circled.  Usagi responded like the virgin she was.  She writhed at 
Rei&#146;s merest touch; more pressure drew gasps and moans from her.  She 
turned her head and kissed Rei desperately, fiercely.  Rei allowed 
only her pinky finger to enter Usagi, and then very shallowly.  Her 
thumb provided the main stimulation as she rubbed the younger woman&#146;s 
stiff clitoris.  Without realizing, Usagi held her breath as she 
climaxed.  She let it out with a soft moan, panted a few quick times, 
and held her breath again.  She repeated this pattern for nearly three 
minutes before her orgasm finally subsided.
    Rei laid Usagi down and then lay behind her, clasping her around 
her heaving ribs.  Eventually, the young princess&#146;s breathing calmed.
    &#147;Why didn&#146;t you&#151;you know&#151;why didn&#146;t you&#133;penetrate me, Rei-sama?&#148; 
she asked, exhausted but exhilarated.
    Rei smiled at her young lover&#146;s enthusiasm.  &#147;I thought you should 
keep your maidenhood until you choose to let it go, Usa-chan.  It&#146;s a 
precious thing, not to be lost lightly.&#148;
    &#147;You know best,&#148; Usagi sighed.  She snuggled back into Rei&#146;s 
embrace, wanting as much skin contact as she could get.  &#147;I love you, 
Rei-chan.  And you definitely know how to make me feel good.&#148;
    &#147;I&#146;m glad, &#147;Princess.&#148;  Rei kissed Usagi&#146;s earlobe, and the pair 
said nothing more.  They were asleep soon.  As she drifted off, Rei 
knew that she could never leave again.</pre>
