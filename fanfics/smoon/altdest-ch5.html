<h1>Altered Destinies (part 5 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/altdest-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Queen Beryl paced the throne room restlessly, wondering how things 
could have gone so very wrong for them. &#39;There are only two Senshi 
battling against us,&#39; she seethed to herself, &#39;and we are an army!&#39; 
But each plot, each strategy to gain the energy of the Earthers was 
thwarted, their emissaries utterly destroyed.

&lt;I need energy, Beryl&gt; the Negaforce hissed from it&#39;s chamber.

&quot;I&#39;m doing all that I can,&quot; Beryl answered, &quot;great Negaforce. But the 
Senshi...&quot;

&lt;You are a fool, Beryl&gt; the Negaforce roared, &lt;I have given you all 
the advantages, but you have failed me again and again.&gt;

&quot;Great Negaforce,&quot; Beryl was clearly working to keep her temper in 
check as she said, &quot;it&#39;s not quite that simple..&quot;

She trailed off, frowning, hearing a disturbance of some kind out in 
the hallway. The massive door suddenly exploded inwards, and Beryl 
gasped in surprise, seeing Sailor Moon and Sailor V standing there in 
the rubble.

&quot;Go, Sailor Moon,&quot; Sailor V said shortly. She ran towards the 
Negaforce chamber, while Sailor Moon ran at Beryl.

&quot;Moon Tiara Magic,&quot; Sailor Moon cried, her tiara glowing brightly as 
it extended outward. In a moment she held a sword, pointing it right 
at Beryl.

&quot;Venus Crescent Beam Smash!&quot; Sailor V cried out, placing two fingers 
on the vessel and blasting the Negaforce chamber at point blank range.

&quot;NO,&quot; Beryl cried out, but she was prevented from moving forward by 
the sword held threateningly in front of her.

&quot;Venus Love-Me Chain,&quot; Sailor V cried out, using her links of chain to 
bind the cloud of dark power, it&#39;s howls of pain echoing throughout 
the room. It moments, the Negaforce had completely dissipated, fading 
away to nothing.

&quot;Please give up, Beryl,&quot; Sailor Moon said to her softly. She smiled at 
her encouragingly, &quot;With the Negaforce gone, you&#39;re free to make new 
choices!&quot; More quietly, &quot;You don&#39;t have to fight against us anymore.&quot;

The redhead hesitated, seemingly taking a moment to weigh the words. 
Suddenly, she lunged at Sailor Moon, hands extended claw-like.

&quot;Look out, Sailor Moon,&quot; Sailor V cried.

Reflexedly, Sailor Moon swung down, her blade shining. A flash of 
light, and Beryl stood there frozen like a statue. She crumbled, ash 
blowing away on a slight draft, even as Sailor Moon looked at her in 
shock.
&quot;I killed her,&quot; Usagi whimpered softly, her eyes red with tears. She 
was sitting on Minako and Natsuna&#39;s couch, not long after their escape 
from the Negaverse.

&#39;I should have prepared her for this,&#39; Minako thought to herself 
sadly, &#39;I know it&#39;s never easy, killing something that looked so 
utterly human.&#39; Softly, she said aloud, &quot;She didn&#39;t give you a choice, 
Usagi.&quot;

&quot;You did what you had to do, Usagi,&quot; Luna said softly. The little cat 
had gotten a lot bigger as her pregnancy had progressed, and she had 
to be careful how she moved.

&quot;She&#39;s right, Usagi,&quot; Artemis backed her up loyally. He got a glare 
from Luna, and decided to keep his mouth shut.

&quot;She was human,&quot; Usagi sighed softly, &quot;and I killed her.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Natsuna said. She sat down on the couch, putting her arm 
across the smaller girl&#39;s shoulders. &quot;It&#39;s not an easy thing, to take 
a life. But you have to think of the lives you may have saved, all the 
people she and the Negaforce wanted to hurt,&quot; she said softly.

Usagi closed her eyes, but she nodded reluctantly.

&#39;Nicely done,&#39; Minako thought, looking at her lover in admiration. 
They all stood there a few moments silently, before she finally 
ventured, &quot;Are you going to be all right, Usagi?&quot;

Usagi looked up, meeting her gaze with those piercing blue eyes. &quot;I 
will be,&quot; she sighed.

&quot;Do you need a ride home?&quot; Natsuna offered her softly.

Usagi nodded, &quot;I promised Ami and Makoto I&#39;d go to the school concert 
with them tonight.&quot; She brightened slightly, &quot;Makoto&#39;s bringing the 
snacks.&quot;

Luna had to fight down a laugh. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind, I think I&#39;ll stay 
here,&quot; she said. Ruefully, &quot;I&#39;m not really up to car rides right now.&quot;

Not long after, and Natsuna pulled up near Usagi&#39;s home to let the 
blonde girl out. Ami grabbed Makoto, pulling her into an alley nearby, 
&quot;Don&#39;t let her see us.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Makoto asked, surprised.

&quot;Usagi&#39;s been trying to keep her and another friend secret,&quot; Ami 
explained cheerfully.

&quot;And you know this how?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Usagi isn&#39;t very good at keeping secrets,&quot; Ami laughed. She paused, 
&quot;Let&#39;s give her a few moments, then we&#39;ll go over to meet her like we 
planned.&quot;

Makoto reached over to take Ami&#39;s hand, and the other girl blushed 
faintly. &quot;Thanks for inviting me along tonight,&quot; she said quietly.

Ami smiled up at her sunnily, &quot;It was my pleasure.&quot; They stood there a 
few moments, each lost in each others eyes.

&quot;We&#39;d better go see Usagi,&quot; Makoto said quietly.

&#39;She is so clueless,&#39; Ami thought with a sigh. &quot;You&#39;re probably 
right,&quot; she admitted aloud. They walked over together, and Makoto rang 
the doorbell.

&quot;Coming,&quot; they heard from inside, and Usagi threw the door open 
cheerfully. &quot;Hi guys,&quot; she smiled, dressed in a simple white dress.

&quot;Ready to go?&quot; Makoto asked. She hefted a large box, &quot;I packed bento 
for all of us.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s eyes glowed happily, &quot;Thank you!&quot;

They walked together, enjoying the evening, and Usagi noticed 
something. Ami, whenever she could, reached out to take Makoto&#39;s hand, 
the taller girl clasping it in her own. They tried to be subtle, but 
Usagi thought it was cute.

Somebody else noticed, too. Haruka walked the three walk by them, 
pushing her sandy blonde hair back. Michiru stood beside her, the 
green haired girl holding her arm. &quot;They certainly are cute together,&quot; 
Michiru smiled.

&quot;I suppose so,&quot; Haruka said, but it was obvious that she was a bit 
distracted. &quot;Do you think Setsuna&#39;s right, that the other inner will 
be revealed today?&quot; she asked.

&quot;She&#39;s been right so far,&quot; Michiru nodded.

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Setsuna walked up to them, giving Haruka a mildly scolding 
look. &quot;Let&#39;s grab our seats, before the concert starts,&quot; she 
suggested.

The three of them settled down, and not long after, the show began. 
The first few performers were good, nothing special, but good.

&quot;I&#39;m bored,&quot; Usagi said plaintively, &quot;can we eat soon?&quot;

&quot;Shhh,&quot; Ami shushed her as the announcer stepped up.

&quot;Our next performer wishes to remain anonymous,&quot; he smiled, &quot;so please 
give a warm welcome to the Masked Maiden.&quot;

She walked out, dressed in a simple black dress, and stepped up behind 
a synthesizer keyboard. Her eyes were hidden by a small mask and her 
voice was quiet as she smiled, &quot;This song is dedicated to the one that 
I haven&#39;t found yet.&quot; She began to play a soft introduction, and then 
she began to sing:

Deep in my soul, love so strong, it takes control, Now we both know, 
the secret&#39;s bared, the feelings show, Driven far apart, I make a wish 
on a shooting star,

Usagi shivered, the masked figure&#39;s gaze lingering on her. &#39;It almost 
feels like I know her,&#39; she thought, &#39;but I&#39;ve never seen her before!&#39;

There will come a day, somewhere far away, In your arms I&#39;ll stay, my 
only love, Even though you&#39;re gone, love will still live on, the 
feeling is so strong, my only love, my only love.

Setsuna blew out a breath she wasn&#39;t aware she was holding. &quot;That&#39;s 
her,&quot; she whispered to Haruka and Michiru, &quot;that&#39;s the fifth Inner.&quot;

There will come a day, somewhere far away, In your arms I&#39;ll stay, my 
only love, You&#39;ve reached the deepest part, of the secret in my heart, 
Known it from the start, My only love, My only love...

Natsuna put her arm over Minako&#39;s shoulder, for now not caring if they 
drew any attention. &quot;I&#39;m glad we decided to go,&quot; she said to Minako 
quietly.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Minako admitted, laying her head on Natsuna&#39;s shoulder. A 
few moments later, and they slipped away.

Makoto turned to Ami, and was surprised by a gentle brushing of lips. 
&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami smiled, &quot;but you weren&#39;t getting the hint any other way.&quot;

Makoto went red, but she bent forward to kiss Ami back.

The Masked Maiden strode off the stage, the crowd&#39;s cheers ringing out 
behind her. Ignoring the congratulations of the other performers she 
slipped away into the shadows. A hand pulled the mask off, and she 
blew a breath out nervously.

&quot;Who was that blonde girl?&quot; Rei Hino asked herself softly.

To be continued in... The Secret of Tuxedo Kamen!

Author&#39;s Note: Yes, &quot;My Only Love&quot; is my favorite tune from the 
English dub. This is the end of the preludes, and now I have to decide 
if I want to do any sequels to &quot;Altered Destinies.&quot; Let me know what 
you think!
