<h1>Haunted Nights</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Minako Aino, TV actress, film star and all around idol, paused as she 
looked up at her manager and asked him, &quot;So what am I doing here again?&quot; 
The blonde had a engaging smile, a merry sense of humor dancing in her 
blue eyes and a sexy body that made more than one person do a double 
take.

&#39;Too bad I already have a girlfriend,&#39; Mamoru thought wryly as the tall, 
black haired man held the car door open for her. &quot;It&#39;s publicity for 
your latest film,&quot; the black business suit clad man reminded her, 
&quot;Horror High Two: the return.&quot;

&quot;Oh that piece of drivel,&quot; Minako sighed wryly, her simple dress 
swirling around her long, model&#39;s legs..

&quot;That drivel makes a lot of money,&quot; Mamoru shrugged. He pushed his hair 
back casually, &quot;We&#39;re doing a live action spoof here, basically.&quot;

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Minako smiled as they went to the back of the crowded 
amusement park, the autumn air brisk as they hurried in through the 
stage door. &quot;How much of my clothing am I going to shed this time?&quot; she 
raised a eyebrow.

&quot;Not too much,&quot; Mamoru laughed, &quot;it&#39;s a PG rated show.&quot; A young man met 
them, his glasses gleaming as he nervously led them in. &quot;How&#39;s the set 
up going, Greg?&quot; Mamoru asked him as they walked.

&quot;Pretty well,&quot; he smiled, brown hair falling messily into his eyes as 
Greg continued, &quot;we&#39;ve got the actresses for the monsters all set.&quot;

&quot;Actresses?&quot; Minako said with somewhat more interest.

&quot;Knowing your preferences,&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;I thought you&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be a stick in the dirt,&quot; Minako poked him in the side.

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean mud?&quot; Greg offered tentatively, a baseball cap holding 
back his hair. With his jeans and t-shirt, he looked like almost every 
stage hand Minako had ever met.

&quot;Mud, dirt, same thing,&quot; Minako shrugged as they went through the busy 
halls, teeming with production crew until they reached the set.

&quot;Oh ho ho ho ho!&quot;the brown haired woman dressed all in black leather 
called out, her full breasts barely contained by her little top, her 
skin eerily pale.

&quot;Please,&quot; the blue haired girl begged, her ragged clothes revealing a 
slim but attractive figure, &quot;no more!&quot;

&quot;You will join my army,&quot; the taller woman smiled, fangs gleaming as she 
advanced menacingly, &quot;of the UNDEAD!&quot;

&quot;Very nice,&quot; the slim, sandy haired young man emerged, &quot;though Makoto, 
your introductory laugh needs to be a bit scarier.&quot;

&quot;Right, Ms Tenoh,&quot; Makoto Kino nodded respectfully.

&#39;Ms?&#39; Minako looked at Tenoh again in surprise, only then noticing the 
swell of breasts under her man&#39;s shirt.

&quot;How was my performance, ma&#39;am?&quot; the small blue haired woman asked 
nervously, taking a pair of glasses out of her costume and putting them 
on. With that she went from a scantily clad damsel in distress to a 
raggedly clad nerdette, almost in a instant.

&quot;You&#39;re doing all right, Ami,&quot; Haruka Tenoh looked more amused than 
anything else by her actress&#39; subtle transformation, &quot;though you&#39;re 
going to have to try and look a bit more terrified of Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Ami bowed.

Just then Haruka noticed Minako&#39;s arrival and the director smiled 
warmly. &quot;Miss Aino, welcome,&quot; Haruka advanced, taking Minako&#39;s hand and 
then surprisingly bending over to kiss the back gently.

Minako chuckled at the old fashioned greeting, &quot;It seems you&#39;ve already 
started, I&#39;m sorry if I was late.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right on time,&quot; Haruka corrected smoothly, &quot;many of our cast are 
new actresses, so I organized a early rehearsal for them.&quot;

&quot;Ah, I understand,&quot; Minako nodded. &quot;So, should I get changed?&quot; she 
asked.

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Haruka yelled then turned to Minako. &quot;Miss Kaoru is our 
costumer,&quot; she explained, &quot;she&#39;ll get you set up.&quot;

A lovely young woman with blue-green hair bustled from back stage, 
quickly giving Haruka a kiss on the cheek. &quot;I hope this letch hasn&#39;t 
been too much trouble?&quot; Michiru joked as she took Minako&#39;s hand.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s been a perfect gentleman,&quot; Minako fought back a 
smile as Haruka looked mildly flustered.

&quot;That&#39;s when you really need to worry,&quot; Michiru laughed as they headed 
back to the dressing rooms.

As they walked a slim black haired girl advanced, her skin ghostly 
against the rags that covered her body, her violet eyes striking as she 
met Minako&#39;s eyes. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she murmured as she brushed by them.

&quot;Who is THAT?&quot; Minako found herself whispering, faintly surprised at how 
it had felt meeting the gaze of those stunning eyes.

&quot;Hotaru Tomoe,&quot; Michiru said as they reached the room with Minako&#39;s name 
on the door, &quot;she&#39;s new to the business.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d certainly remember seeing her before,&quot; Minako admitted, silently 
resolving to keep an eye on her.

&quot;So why am I a fire demon?&quot; Rei Hino waved a hand as they left the 
dressing room a sort time later. The black haired woman was sheathed 
head to toe in red plastic, the material molded to her body enough to be 
sensual, not erotic.

&quot;We all drew lots, remember,&quot; Usagi Tsukino said, the pretty blonde in a 
tiger stripped bikini advancing on Rei with a cute set of devil horns in 
hand.

With a blush Rei looked away from Usagi&#39;s pert breasts, barely contained 
by the bikini. &quot;If I find out Mamoru-baka rigged this,&quot; she grumbled as 
Usagi set the devil horns in place, &quot;he&#39;s gonna pay.&quot;

Minako fought back a chuckle as she walked by, dressed in almost as 
little as the other women. Of course in her case it was because her 
girl&#39;s school uniform was ripped to simulate running from monsters. The 
blouse was half torn off, the skirt was shredded and flashes of white 
under things were visible. Of course the audience wouldn&#39;t know she was 
also wearing a thin, flesh colored body stocking to prevent any real 
exposure, so to speak.

&quot;Minako,&quot; Haruka nodded in greeting as she entered the stage, &quot;your just 
in time for the dark queen&#39;s arrival.&quot;

Despite not having a scrip handy Minako was a trooper. &quot;What do you want 
me to do?&quot; she asked eagerly.

&quot;The monsters have captured you,&quot; Haruka gestured to Usagi and Rei, who 
grasped her arms gently but firmly, &quot;and they&#39;re taking you to the 
queen.&quot;

Minako took her cute and struggled weakly, looking helpless in the 
monster&#39;s stronger grips while still putting up a fight. &quot;Where are you 
taking me?&quot; she ad libbed.

&quot;Very nice,&quot; Haruka nodded happily. She gestured to the wings and 
ordered, &quot;Makoto, bring up your victim Amy.&quot;

Gracefully Makoto strode into the scene with Ami in her arms, a bit of 
red paint at Ami&#39;s throat faking blood. &quot;I have claimed the first, my 
queen,&quot; she declared.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Haruka cheered. &quot;All right,&quot; she waved, &quot;demon queen, that&#39;s your 
cue!&quot;

Dry ice made mist swirl around the stage as a platform lifted, a throne 
rising up from the white haze. She sat regally, like a true ruler, and 
her dark garb made her seem ghostlike in the bright lights. Hotaru rose 
gracefully as the throne reached the stage level then commanded, &quot;Bring 
her to me.&quot;

Still struggling more for effect than anything else Minako was pulled 
forward, stepping through the chill mists. &quot;What...do you want?&quot; Minako 
asked with that breathy, damsel in distress voice she was so good at.

&quot;What do I want?&quot; Hotaru asked, bending close so that their lips nearly 
touched. &quot;I want you,&quot; she purred.

&#39;I think I&#39;m REALLY going to enjoy this play,&#39; Minako thought, fighting 
back a smile.

&quot;Yes, just what I wanted,&quot; Haruka crowed, interrupting the moment.

&quot;Uhm, Tenoh-san, isn&#39;t this going to be a bit much for a free 
performance?&quot; Mamoru asked delicately.

&quot;Yeah, but the movie producers will love the controversy,&quot; Haruka shot 
back with a grin.

&quot;True,&quot; Mamoru agreed.

&quot;I hope I wasn&#39;t too rough,&quot; Rei apologized after the first run through, 
still looking faintly embarrassed by her costume.

&quot;No, it was fine,&quot; Minako laughed. She smiled and excused herself, 
walking over to where Hotaru was getting a drink.

&quot;Miss Aino,&quot; Hotaru smiled shyly, the utter opposite of her demon queen 
character, &quot;you improvise very well.&quot;

&quot;And you followed pretty well,&quot; Minako answered, getting a cup of water. 
A smile, &quot;Call me Minako, we&#39;ll be working a few days together.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru blushed a bit, &quot;Minako.&quot;

&#39;Shy, but cute,&#39; Minako thought. Part of her was tempted to feed her a 
line about private tutoring, but she restrained herself. &quot;Are you doing 
anything this evening?&quot; she asked instead.

Hotaru blushed again, &quot;No....&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t worked with Tenoh but usually there&#39;s a bullshit session 
after a day&#39;s rehearsals at some local spot,&quot; Minako grinned, &quot;if I have 
to, I&#39;ll organize the outing myself.&quot;

&quot;I think you would, too,&quot; Hotaru flashed a fleeting smile.

&quot;So,&quot; Minako grinned, &quot;you&#39;ll come?&quot;

Hotaru seemed surprised by the invitation, then she smiled, her eyes 
sparkling with pleasure, &quot;I&#39;d love to.&quot;

A beginning....

Notes: May or may not be a part two, depending on how inspiration hits. 
This is another of my Halloween fics for this year, too.</pre>
