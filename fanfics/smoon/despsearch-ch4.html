<h1>Desperately Searching (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/despsearch-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Haruka grunted as she came to a landing at the top of the staircase, her 
great golden wings complaining at the strain of the carefully controlled 
flight.  She stood up, stretching her limbs before knocking on the white 
door at the top of the staircase.
 
A tall woman with red hair and golden eyes opened the door, wearing a 
long silky dress that seemed to be absorb the pink tint in the light and 
darken it to red in the material.  &quot;Oh, a Sky Person.  I don&#39;t know why 
you came through the caves&#151;there is a balcony entrance, though I suppose 
it is hard to find in the rain.  Are you cold?  You don&#39;t seem to be 
wearing that much.  Or are you hungry?  I imagine the Darklings didn&#39;t 
feed you&#151;most of their food makes outsiders sick, though the poor dears 
do try.  Your eyes remind me of Kazeko; you must be one of her 
daughters.  She had two, right?  I guess you&#39;re the older one, 
Haruka&#151;I&#39;m told that Kotori is a little redhead.&quot;  The woman reached out 
and grabbed Haruka&#39;s hand, her rapid-fire question-and-answer session 
leaving the Skyling reeling, unable to think.  &quot;I know you must be tired 
if you flew up that staircase!  Come on inside and we&#39;ll see what we can 
do for you.&quot;
 
The woman pulled Haruka inside, leading her down a short marbled 
corridor to a huge chamber carved out of the very heart of the mountain, 
crystal columns reaching out of sight, a fountain tinkling peacefully in 
the center, light streaming in from windows on the sides of the 
mountain, colorful carpet covering the floor, women seated on couches 
and pillows scattered throughout the room.  One, a gorgeous pale blonde 
with pink eyes, rose off her pillow, white dress changing to gold as she 
passed under one of the skylights, smiling as she took the redhead&#39;s 
free head.  &quot;Who is our Skyling guest, Riko?&quot;
 
&quot;Asakaze, meet Haruka, daughter of Kazeko and rightful Queen of the Sky 
People.  My name is Rikuriko and this is my partner, Asakaze.&quot;
 
&quot;Are you all women?&quot;
 
Rikuriko nodded.  &quot;All Speakers of the Guardian&#151;or Keepers of the Light 
as the Darklings call us&#151;are women.  When the Guardian of Time began to 
recruit us, she knew that the males that Darklings birthed every now and 
then would soon die out and their species would be all female.  In order 
to show that she respects every species, she made all of her Oracles 
female so that there would be no conflict with the mountain-dwellers.  
We can adapt to her power much more easily than males, in any case.  All 
Speakers are paired, too; the Guardian chooses soul mates always.  She 
doesn&#39;t want us to be lonely in her service.  Natsuko!  Fuyuko!  Our 
guest is no doubt hungry and will be joining us for the midday meal.&quot;
 
Two of the Speakers&#151;one with orange-gold eyes and chestnut hair and one 
with white eyes and pale blue hair&#151;nodded and slipped into another room, 
obviously heading to the kitchen or wherever food was prepared.  &quot;What 
do you guys do up here?&quot;
 
&quot;We serve the peoples of this planet.  We&#39;re peacekeepers, though few 
have asked for our help in almost twenty years.  The Guardian doesn&#39;t 
seem too worried, though.&quot;
 
Haruka walked forward, wings open wide as she tried to imagine the size 
of the cave.  &quot;This place is huge . . . where&#39;s the Dark Queen the 
Darklings mentioned?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, she&#39;s off somewhere with our newest member.  Ailan was the first 
Keeper to come here without a soul mate.  We think that the Queen fell 
in love with her herself and chose her to be her partner.  I imagine it 
must be lonely at the top, and all.  She probably won&#39;t join us for 
supper, but I&#39;ll take you to meet her afterwards.  By the way, why are 
you headed through our mountains, anyway?  Don&#39;t you Sky People live 
father west?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m heading for the sea, which I am told is to the east.&quot;
 
&quot;Then the queen should be able to help you.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Ailan purred as Setsuna ran her hands over her breasts, the silky 
material of her dress scratching her as the Dark Queen&#39;s hands moved 
lower, searching blindly for the hem of her dress.  Ailan gasped as 
Setsuna covered her lips with her own, the fire in their kiss igniting 
the silver-haired woman&#39;s lust.  Then she felt Setsuna&#39;s hand find its 
target between her legs, and she arched her back, pressing her body 
against Setsuna&#39;s, moaning in anticipation of what was to come.
 
Unfortunately for the young Seer, it never came.
 
A short, sharp knock sounded on the wooden paneling, eliciting a curse 
from the very aroused Dark Queen.  Ailan sighed and rolled off the low 
couch, straightening her dress as Rikuriko spoke from the other side of 
the door.  &quot;Megami-sama?  We have a guest, a Skyling princess.&quot;
 
Ailan leaned over and kissed Setsuna, letting her tongue tease the older 
woman before she pulled away and headed for the huge balcony, leaving 
the glass doors open behind her.  &quot;Later, my love,&quot; she called as she 
vanished into the gardens.
 
Setsuna sighed and straightened her dark robes, calming her lust with a 
lot of effort and millennia of practice, brushing her long green hair 
over her shoulders and sitting on the ornate black throne her Keepers 
had carved from opal hundreds of years earlier.  Her Time Key, the tool 
through which she focused her power, waited quiescently in the stand by 
her throne, waiting for her need.  When she was ready, she cleared her 
throat and spoke in her most majestic voice.  &quot;Enter, Rikuriko.&quot;
 
The red-haired Speaker entered the Throne Room and bowed briefly before 
pulling a tall Sky Woman with short blonde hair, emerald eyes, and 
golden wings into the chamber.  &quot;Kurai Ojo&#39;ou-sama, this is Haruka, 
daughter of Kazeko, of the Sky People.&quot;

Setsuna smiled as she waved a hand.  &quot;You are dismissed, Rikuriko.&quot;  The 
Speaker left, and Setsuna descended from her throne and dais.  &quot;A 
Skyling,&quot; she breathed.  &quot;There hasn&#39;t been one of your people here in 
centuries.  You have all forgotten me.&quot;
 
Haruka raised one eyebrow.  &quot;I&#39;m not so sure.  We still worship the 
Goddess of Storms, a dark-robed queen with dark green hair and fiery red 
eyes.  I think that&#39;s you.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s nice.  I am called Setsuna by my friends.  Why have you come to 
me, Haruka?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m trying to find my people&#39;s ancestral home, and Kiyoshi-kun said 
that it was by the sea.  Therefore, I am pointed fairly eastward.&quot;
 
Setsuna took Haruka&#39;s arm and led her out onto the huge balcony, 
complete with sprawling gardens, majestic fountains, and marble 
temple-like buildings where visitors could pray to her or the other 
gods.  A slender woman in a white dress that shimmered silver in the 
light with silver hair and purple eyes met them, a question on her lips.  
&quot;Ailan, this is Haruka, Kazeko&#39;s oldest daughter and heir.&quot;
 
Ailan bowed, and Haruka smiled at the two.  &quot;The other Seers told me 
that you two are an item, that you brought her here as your soul mate.&quot;
 
Setsuna nodded.  &quot;They&#39;re right, and they know it.  I couldn&#39;t help it&#151;I 
was lonely, I fell in love, and I tempted her back to my mountain home.&quot;
 
&quot;And I never regretted a moment of it,&quot; Ailan whispered lovingly.  She 
waved her hand, turning to the sun-caressed flowers.  &quot;What do you think 
of my gardens?&quot;
 
&quot;They&#39;re breathtaking; I don&#39;t think any of my people are so skilled.  
You did all of this?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  Before I met Setsuna, my last girlfriend was wonderful with 
flowers&#151;we joked that she had to be part Elf.  When she died I devoted 
myself to her flowers.  This garden has become a beacon of love, and I 
made this for Setsuna.&quot;
 
&quot;Who were you before you became a Keeper?&quot;
 
&quot;I was the High Princess of the Plains that lie between the hills on the 
other side of these mountains and the forests by the edge of the sea.  I 
haven&#39;t been here that long, only one generation, and my little sister 
is High Queen now.&quot;  Her smile saddened a little, and she glanced at 
Setsuna.
 
&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ailan-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Nothing, Haruka-san,&quot; the silver-haired woman whispered, turning away.  
Setsuna rested her hand on the slender woman&#39;s shoulder, trying to 
comfort her lover.  &quot;It&#39;s just that . . . a few years after I came here, 
my sister, Noriko, visited to tell me that she was sterile.  She 
couldn&#39;t have the daughter needed to take over as queen after her.  Her 
husband had no idea.  In order to keep my kingdom alive, I agreed to 
help, and Setsuna used some of her magic to impregnate me.&quot;  Ailan 
sighed, one hand fluttering across her flat belly, remembering the 
child.  &quot;Two months into my pregnancy I visited my sister and had her 
announce that she was with child and brought her here, to my mountain 
retreat.  Eight or so months later, after I nursed little Serenity long 
enough for the wet nurse we found to take over&#151;actually, it was Rikuriko 
who volunteered&#151;Noriko went home, carrying her heir.  Every oldest 
daughter of my line is named Serenity, but I think they call her Usagi.  
I really miss her, you know.  I could visit, but I haven&#39;t been able to 
find the strength to see my daughter without her knowing the truth.&quot;
 
&quot;I can&#39;t believe that you gave up your only daughter like that.  I know 
I couldn&#39;t have.&quot;
 
&quot;She has a better life down there, anyway.  She&#39;s High Princess of the 
Plains and one day will be queen in her own right.  Just because I 
didn&#39;t want the throne doesn&#39;t mean that she should be denied that 
choice.&quot;  The three finally reached the edge of the flowered plateau, 
and Setsuna stepped aside so Haruka could have an unobstructed view of 
the land before her.  Haruka gasped at the simple beauty beyond the 
mountains.  Rolling green hills topped by simple cities flattened into 
golden plain studded by simple huts and fields of grain tinged by green 
forest along the horizon, tiny red volcanoes rising out of red desert to 
the south.
 
&quot;It&#39;s beautiful . . .&quot; she breathed.
 
&quot;The ruins of your ancestral home is beyond the forest.  So is the sea.  
If you pass by the palace on your flight, you should stop by to visit 
our daughter.&quot;
 
&quot;I will, Setsuna-san.&quot;  Her boldness amused the dark queen.  She bowed 
deeply, wings curled in friendly submissiveness.  &quot;I thank you for the 
help and the directions.  I will stop by on my way home.  If I go home.&quot;
 
Setsuna smiled at the Skyling.  &quot;Oh, I have no doubt that we will meet 
again, young princess.  Good luck on your journey.&quot;
 
Haruka opened her great wings, carefully testing the winds billowing 
under her before leaping into the startlingly blue sky, adjusting her 
golden feathers before soaring off toward the plains.  Setsuna smiled as 
she pulled Ailan into her arms.  &quot;I was wondering when she would come.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s so young and full of life.  I&#39;m going to miss her, Setsu-chan.&quot;
 
Setsuna kissed the side of Ailan&#39;s neck, pulling the former princess 
back into her rooms.  &quot;I have a few ideas how to make you forget.&quot;
 
Ailan stopped her, placing a hand on Setsuna&#39;s collarbone.  &quot;I need to 
ask you something first.  Setsu-chan, three months ago when we were 
celebrating the Darkling Unification, did you . . . did we . . . that 
burst of power . . . am I pregnant?&quot;
 
&quot;God I hope so.  I tried so hard.&quot;  Setsuna grinned as the silver-haired 
woman jumped into her arms.  &quot;You had been so melancholy and I just 
wanted to see you smile again.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m so happy, Setsu-chan!  And that explains this damn morning 
sickness.  I never had any with Usagi.  Another daughter . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Actually, twins.&quot;</pre>
