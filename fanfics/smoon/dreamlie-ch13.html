Serena, Terri, Hotaru, and Rei watched as Mina, Ami, and Michelle, 
armed with paint slowly stalked their girlfriends. Amara, Lita, and 
Setsuna backed away from their paint covered loves to the south wall. 
The four watching laughed until their sides ached as the three 
cowering Senshi were splashed with sapphire blue, sun yellow, and sea 
green paint.

Today a nervous Queen Terrestria would be making a speech to her 
people. Telling them all that she was going to marry the Queen of 
Mars. On Terrestrial the Outer Senshi stood behind their leader. Her 
arms were shaking as she approached the ledge of the balcony. Only the 
heavens knew how her people would react to her marrying another queen. 

- Well, here I go. -

&#147; My people I have called you here for a joyous announcement! I have 
decided to marry!&#148; Cheers rang out and died at the signal.

&#147; My fianc&eacute; is the Queen of Mars. Our worlds will combine when we are 
married, possibly before hand. I must have your permission first to do 
so. Representatives will be escorted to the Palace Conference room 
after the decision has been made. Good day everyone.&#148; Queen Terrestria 
bowed and left through the balcony door. The Outers followed. They 
reached an oak door that led to the inside of the conference room. 
Terrestria sat on the white sofa, setting her crown on the table. 

&#147; What if they won&#146;t let us? I don&#146;t want a rebellion.&#148; She looked at 
her guardians. 

&#147; We&#146;ll compromise. Terress&#146;s aren&#146;t cruel beings. I&#146;m sure your 
people will agree.&#148; Setsuna didn&#146;t look too concerned.

&#147; My scientists are so close to completing the crystals. Their sure we 
will be able to have children.&#148; 

&#147; Go-&#148; A knock interrupted Michelle.

&#147; Your Majesty. The Representatives have arrived.&#148; 

&#147; Send them in Forest.&#148; The General nodded and four people entered. 
Two women and two men. Dressed in noble wear. Terrestria gestured to 
four white chairs. 

&#147; Please sit. That certainly was a fast decision. &#147; They seated 
themselves and a woman with caramel colored hair and ruby red eyes 
spoke. 

&#147; Yes my Queen. The people were very sure in their answer. They have 
granted you permission.&#148; Grins spread. A dark blue haired man with 
brown eyes spoke next. 

&#147; Some were reluctant but decided in the end to allow it. Their only 
worry was of an heir. Will there be one?&#148; The planet Queen smiled.

&#147; There will be. My scientists are currently working on a special 
crystal that will allow me to become pregnant. Their very confident it 
will work. If not, there are other ways. Though if I have two 
children, the worlds will separate and each will rule a planet. It 
won&#146;t be for years yet.&#148; The Representatives smiled warmly at their 
happy Queen. They bowed and left. Terrestria snapped her fingers. Her 
silver gown swapped for lavender short-shorts, a light yellow tank, 
and some sandals. Terri&#146;s pretty white hair in pigtail braids at her 
side. The two chestnut strips weaving in and out of the braids. The 
others followed suit. Terri jumped and cried out happily. Hugging the 
closet person to her. Amara gasped for air. 

&#147; Oh they said yes! I hope they did on Mars!&#148; Hotaru joined her 
&#146;sister&#146; in squeezing poor Amara.

&#147; I can&#146;t wait to see your children!&#148; 

Setsuna and Michelle looked at Amara with pity and grinned. So what&#146;s 
happening on Mars?

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

A/N: Keep reading! I&#146;m sorry if this chapter is kinda corny. Of course 
there are other chapters worse than this&#133;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

&#147; Oh God&#133;You guys I&#146;m so nervous!&#148; Queen Rei paced back and forth. Her 
red gown trailing behind, her fiery crown fighting to stay upon her 
raven haired head. 

&#147; Rei, please your making me dizzy! Everything will be fine.&#148; Serenity 
tried to calm Rei down. What women wouldn&#146;t be worried she couldn&#146;t 
marry the one she loved? 

- Why does it depend on the people?! This is driving me insane!- 

&#147; Queen Rei, it&#146;s time for your speech.&#148; Queen Mina smiled as she held 
the curtain open. The Inners stood behind the nervous Fire Senshi. She 
calmed her self and spoke. 

&#147; My people, I have come before you to tell of my engagement.&#148; Cheers 
erupted and faded at the sigh of their queen. 

&#147; I have proposed to the High Queen of Terrestrial. She&#146;s accepted. 
When the marriage has taken place, Mars and Terrestrial will combine 
as one. I ask for your permission to do this. Representatives will be 
shown to the Conference room.&#148; Mars bowed and swiftly left. The others 
quickly followed her to the conference room. There they relaxed on the 
plush red sofas. Mina took of her pulsing crown. 

&#147; My, will I have to go through this when I marry Setsuna?&#148; Ami looked 
at the Venusian Queen. 

&#147; Oh&#133;is this an official plan Mina?&#148; The blonde blushed, replacing the 
crown on her golden head.

&#147; No, just a dream. For now.&#148; They sat in a comfortable silence for 
ten minutes when a woman a woman with short, dark pink hair and 
periwinkle eyes came in. 

&#147; Your Majesty?&#148; The five royals looked up. 

&#147; Treenity, come and sit. Where are the others?&#148; She sat and sighed.

&#147; Well, unfortunately Tora, Seth, and Vera caught the cold that&#146;s 
going around and were too sick to come.&#148; Rei smiled slightly.

&#147; I see, well what was the decision?&#148;

&#147; Yes, but one problem, an heir.&#148; The fire goddess grinned.

&#147; Terrestria has something up her sleeve.&#148; 

Treenity bowed and exited. Rei changed into some red Capri&#146;s and a 
white tank, with sneakers. The other&#146;s doing the same. They were 
walking down the hallway when tanned arms encircled Rei&#146;s waist. 

&#147; Hiya Firebird!&#148; Terri turned Rei around. 

&#147; Dragon, are we getting married?&#148; Rei didn&#146;t receive a verbal answer. 
Just two slender arms around her neck and soft full red lips against 
her own. The two kissed for a few minutes, loving the answer. 

&#147; Geeze, do you two have built in oxygen tanks?&#148; They blushed and 
separated. Rei glared at the pregnant Neo-Queen. She turned to her 
gorgeous fianc&eacute; and smiled.

&#147; I get to where the tux.&#148; The Senshi laughed and the couple embraced 
in an excited/loving hug.

A/N: Well, that chap is done! It was originally two separate chaps&#133;but 
I felt it had to be longer so mushed them together!</pre>
