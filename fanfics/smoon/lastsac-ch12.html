----------------------------------------------------------------------

&#39;It&#39;s all my fault!  I should have paid more attention.  She must have 
been weak earlier and I didn&#39;t see it.&#39;
 
Michiru stared into the darkness, desperately seeking her lover.  
&quot;Haruka!  Where are you?  I can hear you but I can&#39;t see you.  Help me.&quot;
 
&#39;Michiru?  Are you waking up?  Can you hear me?  Please wake up, 
Michiru.&#39;
 
Michiru fell to the ground, staring up into the black sky.  &quot;Where are 
you, Haruka?&quot;  She saw a golden flash, very far away, and she reached 
for it, desperately trying to return to her beloved. 
 
&#39;Not yet.  Wait.&#39;
 
&quot;Who are you?&quot;
 
&#39;Watch.&#39;  A purple light appeared right in front of Michiru, forming a 
symbol she knew all too well.  &quot;Saturn,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;It can&#39;t be.  
Saturn hasn&#39;t awakened in generations.&quot;
 
The symbol showed the face of a young girl, the Princess of Dosei, in 
the fuku of Sailor Saturn, the Silence Glaive in her hands.  She swung 
it down, and the world went dark.  &quot;She can&#39;t!  I can&#39;t let Hotaru-chan 
awaken as Sailor Saturn.  She would destroy everything!  Who is this 
enemy that the Sailor Senshi can&#39;t defeat without the help of the Sailor 
of Destruction?&quot;
 
&#39;You must stop the darkness.  It&#39;s coming; no one will survive.&#39;

Michiru waved her hand, erasing the vision.  &quot;We can.  We will.&quot;  
Standing up, dressed in her Sailor fuku, Neptune reached for the light 
in the sky that she knew would lead to her beloved.  She jumped into the 
air, flying on Haruka&#39;s power, calling.

&quot;Haruka.&quot;

&quot;Michiru?&quot;

Michiru opened her eyes, smiling when she recognized her lover.  
&quot;Haruka.  I heard you calling me.  Thank you for leading me home.&quot;

Haruka pulled the aqua-haired princess into her arms and held her, 
desperate not to cry.  &quot;I was so scared.&quot;

&quot;It was the mirror, Haruka.  It came to me to show me what is coming.  
Saturn is awakening.&quot;

&quot;What?  Masaka!&quot;

Michiru pulled away, reaching for the mirror on the table beside her 
bed.  &quot;It showed me Sailor Saturn and the end of our world, but it 
cannot tell me what is awakening the young Princess of Dosei.  We have 
to stop her and the coming evil, or we are all doomed.&quot;

&quot;Is this our fault?  Setsuna-san said that the combination of two Outer 
Senshi would destroy the world; is this what she meant?&quot;

&quot;No, my love.  This has been building for quite some time, since before 
we even met.  Only now is the spirit of Saturn stirring.  Only together 
can we six, the newest of the Sailor Senshi, stop the coming silence.  
We can do this, though.&quot;

&quot;Should we really involve them?  They are supposed to protect the 
princess specifically while we are to guard the kingdom.  Shouldn&#39;t the 
Outer Senshi band together to stop Saturn?&quot;  Haruka looked at Michiru&#39;s 
mirror, thinking of her own destiny.  &quot;We shouldn&#39;t make Queen Serenity 
awaken her daughter as Sailor Moon prematurely.&quot;

&quot;Haruka, if I had a dream, Rei-chan at least had a premonition.  She 
knows that the end is fast approaching and she deserves to be allowed to 
fight it with us.  We don&#39;t have to tell the queen if you are afraid for 
young Serenity-san.&quot;

Haruka nodded, looking at the door to the next room where she knew the 
other Senshi were waiting.  &quot;I really don&#39;t know what we can do.  For 
now, we ought to tell the others to keep an eye out for new enemies and 
return home.  Your birthday is fast approaching and we need to return 
your henshin stick and mirror before your mother realizes that they are 
missing.  She&#39;s not attuned to the Aqua Mirror anymore and may not know 
yet.&quot;

&quot;It won&#39;t take her long to figure out what we&#39;ve done once we return,&quot; 
Michiru whispered.  &quot;I&#39;ve never disobeyed her before.&quot;

Haruka kissed Michiru&#39;s forehead gently.  &quot;You&#39;re not alone anymore.  
I&#39;ll protect you.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

&quot;But what are we supposed to be watching for?  We Inners don&#39;t know how 
to sense evil from outside our Solar System.&quot;

&quot;It may not be from the outside, Rei-chan,&quot; Haruka warned.  &quot;It may be 
from one of our planets, or even Earth.  We just don&#39;t know.  Maybe 
you&#39;ll know in your dream.&quot;

Rei glanced at Minako, waiting patiently by their luggage, and stepped 
closer to the pair of Outer Senshi.  &quot;I don&#39;t want her to get hurt.  
She&#39;s not as powerful as I am, and Inner Senshi aren&#39;t nearly as strong 
as Outers.  If she gets hurt . . .&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;It&#39;s the Outers&#39; job to protect the 
kingdom and the Inners&#39; job to protect the princess.  We&#39;ll know what&#39;s 
coming first and you&#39;ll have time to protect your girl.&quot;  The tall 
blonde kissed Rei&#39;s cheek in a sisterly fashion, smiling as she pushed 
the Princes of Kasei to her lover&#39;s side.  &quot;Good luck on Kinsei.&quot;  
Kiyoshi, who had decided to briefly visit the second planet in order to 
&quot;broaden my horizons&quot; had already left the normal way and would 
transport to Mokusei when he was done.

Rei and Minako touched their henshin sticks and vanished with their 
bags, leaving Makoto, Ami, Haruka, and Michiru alone.  Makoto turned to 
Haruka, emerald eyes locked on emerald.  &quot;Are you two coming to Mokusei 
with us?&quot;

Michiru nodded, fingers tightly clenching the handle of her mirror.  
&quot;Then we have to return to Kaiousei for my birthday so my mother can 
give me this.&quot;  She stared at the mirror, thinking about her dream, and 
she shivered.  &quot;I don&#39;t want it.&quot;  Haruka wrapped her arm around 
Michiru&#39;s waist as the four Senshi vanished.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Haruka watched as Jupiter set below Io&#39;s horizon, painting the landscape 
in golds and greens she wasn&#39;t used to on Miranda.  For the first time 
since she left home, Ten&#39;ou Haruka yearned for the familiarity of 
Uranus.  She was homesick.

&quot;Homesick?  I didn&#39;t know you could feel homesick.&quot;

Haruka turned away from the window, smiling at her lover.  Michiru was 
lying in their double bed, propped up on one elbow as she watched Haruka 
at the window.  &quot;I am, Michiru.  I miss my planet and my people and even 
my father.  I wonder how much he misses me.&quot;

&quot;A lot, I imagine.  You&#39;re all he has left of the only woman he ever 
really loved, and you&#39;re his only heir.  He&#39;s probably angry at himself 
for keeping you cooped up in Miranda castle for so long and wishes that 
he had let you explore the Solar System earlier.  The news report said 
that you were kidnapped.&quot;

&quot;Kidnapped?  He doesn&#39;t think that I ran away?&quot;

&quot;He doesn&#39;t want the rest of the Silver Millennium to know that you were 
so unhappy with him and with Ten&#39;ousei that you would leave.  My mother 
believes that you ran away because you miss your mother.&quot;

&quot;I do miss her, but that&#39;s not why I left.&quot;

&quot;Why did you leave, Haruka?&quot;

The blonde blushed and turned back to the window.  &quot;No reason.&quot;
 
Chuckling, Michiru slipped out of bed and padded over to Haruka&#39;s side, 
silky blue bed dress sighing as it passed over the soft carpet.  &quot;Why, 
Haruka?&quot;

The Princess of Ten&#39;ousei looked down at her wife and pulled her into 
her arms.  &quot;I wanted to meet you.  I remember seeing you when we were 
very young, and I wanted to meet you.&quot;

&quot;That was it?&quot;

&quot;Basically, yes.  Setsuna-san came to my hideout and told me that it did 
no good to obey my father if I never learned how to protect my kingdom.  
She suggested that I disguise myself and go to Kasei and Mokusei to meet 
my partners and to practice for my visit to your home for your party.  
She never expected for destiny to push us together so quickly.&quot;

&quot;Maybe destiny was making up for our mothers,&quot; Michiru suggested softly.  
&quot;Maybe she needs a partnership between Ten&#39;ousei and Kaiousei.&quot;

&quot;Whatever for?  Our love is strong but it can&#39;t change the world.&quot;

&quot;Maybe it can,&quot; Michiru whispered.  Silently, the Senshi watched Jupiter 
disappear.</pre>
