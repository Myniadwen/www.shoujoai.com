<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 2 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Setsuna stood in the corner, her arms crossed as she observed the scene 
before her. Michiru was sipping a cup of tea while trying to calm a 
distressed Usagi. Minako was flipping through a magazine, clearly 
agitated. And Hotaru? Well, she was staring at the door and has been 
closed for the past hour.

The door in question suddenly opened, revealing Ami, Makoto and Haruka. 
The three were shocked to see Setsuna, but before Haruka could comment 
Usagi spoke.

&quot;Ami! How is she?&quot;

The blue-haired pre-med student smiled softly. Everyone in the room 
relaxed.

&quot;Just fine, we put her into a hot bath for a while to warm her up and 
now she&#39;s all tucked in. The concussion is minor, but she&#39;ll be a bit 
clumsy for the next two or three days. The fever isn&#39;t too high.&quot;

A collective sigh of relief came from everyone.

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Mina-chan. She&#39;ll be fine with a little rest.&quot;

Usagi collapsed onto the couch and sighed again.

&quot;But...&quot;

The Princess shot right back up at the word uttered by Haruka. Across 
the room, Hotaru tensed.

&quot;She&#39;ll need someone to watch over her for a couple of days, just to 
make sure. Her grandfather and Yuuichiro are both out of town.&quot;

Minako smiled evilly, her eyes meeting Usagi&#39;s and then Michiru&#39;s. The 
three women smiled to each other and Ami soon caught on.

&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; Minako began, sighing dramatically, &quot;My parents are 
dragging me to Tokyo as I told you guys before. I&#39;ll be gone for over a 
week.&quot;

&quot;And I&#39;m sleeping over at Makoto&#39;s for a while to help set up her 
computer.&quot;

Makoto looked at Ami in confusion before the shorter girl nudged her in 
the ribs. The brunette blinked a few times before nodding furiously.

&quot;Yea, that and the apartment&#39;s been lonelier than normal.&quot;

&quot;Mamo-kun&#39;s coming back tomorrow.&quot;

Haruka and Makoto both snickered. The deep blush on Usagi&#39;s face was a 
hilarious sight.

&quot;Well, Haruka and I have been planning a retreat for a couple of months 
now, but...&quot;

Everyone looked at Hotaru, expecting her to pick up where Michiru left 
off. Feeling all eyes on her, the girl blushed.

&quot;Um... I can stay to take care of Rei-ch... I mean Rei.&quot;

The entire room shared a look while Hotaru turned to Setsuna.

&quot;Care to join me, Setsu-mama?&quot;

Dread seized the other senshi. They had forgotten about Setsuna. And 
with her girlfriend Minako out of town, she&#39;d have no reason to turn 
down the offer.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, but I&#39;m going to be quite busy for the next few days, 
Taru-chan.&quot;

Setsuna smiled softly, but Hotaru knew from her tone that there was no 
room for discussion. Usagi sighed in relief. Their plan worked.

&quot;Well,&quot; Minako said, standing. &quot;Look at the time! We should all get 
going now.&quot;

The blonde walked over and gave Hotaru a quick hug. Her actions were 
then mimicked by the other six women. Makoto smiled at the younger girl 
before walking out.

&quot;Take care of her.&quot;

&quot;I will.&quot;

The last out the door was Minako, ironic since she was the first to 
announce she had to leave. The blonde winked at Hotaru before closing 
the door.

&quot;Have fun!&quot;

Before the youngest senshi could comment, the door closed with a soft 
click. Silence surrounded the princess of Saturn as she paused.

They all knew about her crush.

A groan echoed in the large apartment as a petite body collapsed on the 
couch Usagi occupied with Michiru minutes ago. Were they observant or 
was she losing her touch?

A damp washcloth wiped Rei&#39;s face while concerned violet eyes gazed down 
at the unconscious woman. When was she going to wake up? Oh, what she 
wouldn&#39;t give to see those lavender eyes open right now.

It was strange how similar yet different they were.

Hotaru rinsed the cloth in the basin of hot water beside the bed. 
Squeezing the water out, she carefully wiped her &quot;secret&quot; love&#39;s face 
again.

Their features were similar. Purple eyes, though hers were darker and 
dull in color. She was sure people who saw her eyes thought she was the 
most unemotional person in the world, and they&#39;d be right to a certain 
degree. She hid everything she felt behind a mask, letting no emotion be 
shown to the world.

But Rei&#39;s were a soft lavender color with hints of violet, darkening and 
lightening with her mood. A fire always burned within, either hot and 
suffocating or warm and tender. She let the world see exactly what she 
was feeling and thinking.

And the older woman&#39;s hair was basically raven silk. Light purple in the 
light with red highlights and rich, beautiful ebony in the dark. 
Hotaru&#39;s was just black, like the depth of space.

Ugh, she needed to stop thinking.

Hotaru growled as she picked up the basin and walked into the bathroom. 
The water swirled as it went down the sink drain.

A few days with Rei, even if she was unconscious, was simply too much. 
But the miko needed someone to stay with her, what with her future 
clumsiness, fatigue, drowsiness and the lack of appetite. That and the 
103 degree temperature she had.

Maybe one of the other girls-

Wait. They set her up, so no way was that happening. Even Setsuna was 
against her this time. Wonderful.

Hotaru was lying on the couch in Rei&#39;s room. She would have liked 
sleeping on the comfortable bed in the guest room, but feared the senshi 
of Mars might awake and find herself alone. Of course, all the senshi 
knew Rei was definitely one of the strongest, tough-as-nails and not 
scared of anything. But just imagining waking up in a dark room after a 
fight, a hard fight, with one killer headache, dizzy, nauseous and 
having no idea where you were sent a shiver down Hotaru&#39;s spine.

For Rei&#39;s sake she stayed in the room.

For her own sake she stayed far away from the older woman&#39;s bed.

Love. It did not fit a person like Hotaru Tomoe. After all, who would 
ever think the Goddess of Death and Destruction could love? Much less be 
loved in return? None of the other senshi truly understood her. Yet, 
they all loved her.

Setsuna, Haruka and Michiru loved her as all parents love their 
children. Sure, they weren&#39;t her real parents nor was she their real 
child, but they loved her nevertheless. Usagi loved her. But that&#39;s no 
surprise, Usagi loved everyone. The blonde princess had such a pure 
heart, such a large heart that she loved even the worst people in the 
world. That list included her.

Then there were the Inners. Minako loved her, but it was the love a 
leader had for her charge and comrade. Not matter how much more powerful 
Hotaru was, no matter how much wiser she may be when it came to certain 
things, Minako was the leader. And as the leader, the bond between her 
and the members of the team was strong. Minako loved her, didn&#39;t know 
her, but loved her nonetheless.

Makoto loved her. But it was the love that an older sister has for her 
younger sibling. The brunette could tell she was different from the very 
beginning and the lack of a parental figure in their lives bonded them. 
The green-eyed girl always looked out for her, giving her advice or just 
baking her cookies when she was down.

And Ami. The shy blue-haired genius was always the one Hotaru fled to 
for shelter. The quiet but wise woman has become her friend, her 
confidant. Nights filled with confessions of their love. One difference. 
Ami and Makoto were together. But Rei and Hotaru were not.

And then the miko herself.

Hotaru could never decipher the fire senshi&#39;s feelings for her. She knew 
in the beginning, Rei was weary of her, in the same way that Haruka was. 
After all, who would possibly trust the senshi of Death and Destruction? 
She wouldn&#39;t have. And the priestess was especially protective of Usagi, 
in a way that only Mamoru could rival. Hotaru had known that the miko 
cared for the Princess in a way deeper than friendship since the 
beginning, or suspected it anyhow. The Inners told her so, and even as a 
five year old she could tell.

But after a while, Rei began to pity her. Pitied her for what she went 
through and her life. And because of pity and... well, because the fact 
that Usagi forced the miko, she slowly started to care for her. The 
lavender-eyed woman could never refuse Usagi and listened to everything 
she said, even now.

Then it became a sense of adoration. Rei got closer to her, taking her 5 
year old girl self shopping, to the park and sometimes just hanging out 
with her. When she was around ten, it became a motherly kind of love, 
the same way Michiru, Haruka and Setsuna loved her. At sixteen, it 
became the love of a friend, the kind of friends that rarely talked 
about problems but just enjoyed each other&#39;s company. And now...

Well, that&#39;s the whole problem isn&#39;t it?

Hotaru growled and stood. This was madness. And it is so damn hot in 
this room.

Without thinking, Hotaru took off the blouse she wore, revealing a black 
tank top underneath. Damn, maybe she should have worn a skirt instead of 
jeans. Walking over to the balcony doors and opening them, her petite 
figure slipped out.

----------

Rei suppressed the urge to groan as she floated in and out of 
consciousness. Opening her eyes, she quickly shut them as a wave of 
dizziness hit her. Why the hell was the room spinning? And the huge 
headache didn&#39;t help things either. Slowly, she raised her hand to her 
head, though her arm felt like it weighed fourteen tons.

After several minutes of deep breathing and staying perfectly still, Rei 
figured out three things. First, she felt like hell. Second, she was in 
her room. Third, there was someone in the room with her.

The aura was familiar, though she was too disoriented to tell exactly 
who it was. Hell, she felt lucky to know who she was.

Moving her head slowly, the dizzy woman opened her eyes once again. The 
sight that greeted her was completely unexpected.

A short and slim figure stood on her balcony; the doors open as a cool 
breeze floated into the room, playing with the translucent curtains. A 
simple black tank clung to the curvy body while pale arms supported the 
girl as she leaned against the railing. Shoulder-length black hair 
greatly contrasted with the ivory skin. A hand gracefully flipped the 
black silk over one shoulder, revealing a long and slender neck.

The girl was an amazing sight to behold and the miko knew there wasn&#39;t 
another person in the world like her. Lavender eyes closed as Rei&#39;s nose 
was invaded by the intoxicating scent of vanilla and cherry blossoms. 
Ruby lips curved into a soft smile. Hotaru Tomoe.

Yes, no one in the world could ever be like that girl. Hotaru Tomoe with 
her violet eyes, dark and seemingly empty, but always captivating. Of 
course, Rei Hino knew there was so much more in those eyes than most 
people could ever dream of. The miko regretted treating the girl badly 
in the beginning; she had suffered too much to be treated like trash.

Her pale skin, no one else could ever be that pale. It was the perfect 
example of soft, smooth, ivory skin. Sure, Usagi was pale, but there was 
always a rosy flush in her cheeks that Hotaru didn&#39;t have. Hell, the 
girl had almost no color, though that only contributed to her beauty.

Hotaru suddenly turned around, as if knowing the miko was thinking of 
her at that very moment. Lavender and violet met, light clashing with 
dark. It was obvious the younger woman was shocked by the miko&#39;s 
consciousness.

&quot;Rei! You&#39;re awake!&quot;

The fiery woman winced at the volume. She groaned softly and held her 
hand to her head as Hotaru crossed the distance between them.

The miko tried to sit up, failing miserably. Rolling her eyes, the 
younger girl pushed the stubborn woman back onto the bed.

&quot;And what do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot;

The firm tone surprised Rei, giving Hotaru a chance to tuck the covers 
under her chin.

&quot;W-what happened?&quot;

Both women winced at the sound of the miko&#39;s voice. Violet eyes flashed 
with guilt as the college student helped Rei up slightly and brought a 
glass of water to her lips. It was emptied within seconds.

&quot;You pushed me out of the way when the ice beam came at me.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Rei remembered now. Waking up with a killer headache, the first thing 
she saw was Saturn running straight at the beam. Panic seized her and 
she rushed into action, jumping to her feet. The pain almost caused her 
to fall to her knees, but she charged toward her fellow senshi. Then, 
there was nothing.

&quot;Why were you running straight into the beam anyway?&quot;

Hotaru shifted uncomfortably, unable to meet Rei&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Well, my Death Reborn Revolution can usually block attacks, and since 
the youma was pretty weak by then, I figured my attack would protect me. 
The youma would&#39;ve been pretty surprised that I charged into its beam 
and came out fine, giving me enough time to kill it.&quot;

&quot;So,&quot; Rei said slowly in disbelief, &quot;I threw myself in the way... for 
nothing?&quot;

Hotaru blushed deeply while nodding slowly, playing with Rei&#39;s blanket. 
The miko groaned and pulled the blanket over her head.

&quot;One of the few times I decide to be chivalrous and it wasn&#39;t even 
needed!&quot;

Hotaru smiled softly, pulling the blanket away to reveal a pouting miko. 
Her smile widened and she reached over to brush a strand of hair from 
Rei&#39;s forehead.

&quot;Not needed? Perhaps. Appreciated? Yes.&quot;

Another groan was her response as Rei pulled the blanket over her head 
again.

&quot;How about highly appreciated?&quot;

The blankets were pulled down as lavender eyes glared at the amused and 
guilty but very cute expression on Hotaru&#39;s face.

&quot;Squirt.&quot;

&quot;Hot head.&quot;

&quot;Pale.&quot;

&quot;Bad tempered.&quot;

&quot;Skinny.&quot;

&quot;Stubborn.&quot;

&quot;Cute.&quot;

Hotaru blushed immediately and Rei smiled despite her pounding headache. 
That one always stopped the girl in her tracks, no matter what they were 
arguing about. However, the miko knew it was because Hotaru wasn&#39;t used 
to being complimented in such a way. Despite the girl&#39;s much more stable 
physical condition, her experiences had made it hard to make friends. 
Being called &#39;cute&#39; was only something the senshi did. And even then, it 
was rare.

&quot;Liar.&quot;

Rei opened her mouth to speak but was silence by a wave of dizziness. 
Caught between the desire to comfort her friend and cutting her own head 
off, she managed to find and squeeze Hotaru&#39;s hand. Violet eyes gazed at 
the miko as lavender eyes opened.

&quot;I think it would be best if you slept.&quot;

Underneath the firm and somewhat impersonal comment was concern. Rei 
nodded, only to groan as her headache and the dizziness worsened. How 
the hell was she supposed to sleep?

Hotaru released a long breath. No time like the present to test what 
Setsuna-mama and Rei&#39;s taught her. Sitting down on the bed, she cleared 
her mind of everything. A small hand moved forward, glowing softly. Her 
fingertips trailed down Rei&#39;s face with a feather-light touch. The 
miko&#39;s skin was soft and smooth, just like she knew it&#39;d be.

Rei opened her eyes, gazing at her friend in confusion. Upon seeing the 
reassuring smile and the purple glow of her hand, the miko relaxed. 
Lavender eyes closed again, feeling Hotaru&#39;s healing energy flow through 
her body.

The senshi of Death and Destruction was utterly fascinated. Never in a 
thousand years did she imagine caressing Rei&#39;s face in real life. Sure 
as hell not while she was awake. And for god&#39;s sake, Rei wasn&#39;t stopping 
her.

&#39;You idiot, you&#39;re helping her, of course she doesn&#39;t mind.&#39;

Even so, as much as Hotaru hated doing it, she was going to take 
advantage of the situation while she could. Slowly, she allowed her 
thumb and forefinger to brush against Rei&#39;s closed eyes. The miko didn&#39;t 
move. Feeling bolder, Hotaru traced the curve of the miko&#39;s nose, 
letting it linger at the tip for a while.

It looked like something out of a cartoon actually. A beautiful woman 
lying in bed, long hair fanned out all about her. A glowing angel 
caressing the face of a slumbering beauty tenderly, staring with adoring 
eyes. But she was far from an angel.

Her fingertips continued by brushing against the woman&#39;s cheeks. She 
then traced her jaw, wanting more than anything to touch with her lips 
and not her fingers. An idea came to Hotaru, but she dismissed it 
quickly. No, she couldn&#39;t.

Rei felt like she was floating. She was completely weightless, a 
soothing tingle racing through her body. The headache disappeared and 
the dizzy spell melted away. Hell, was there any other feeling in the 
world besides what she felt now? If there was, it couldn&#39;t possibly 
compare.

Actually, there was only one feeling that could compare. The feel of 
Minako&#39;s lips on hers.

But that was different. Hm... so very different.

Kissing the blond was like drinking 50 cups of coffee in a row. Her 
veins would course with energy, like was being charged by a source of 
raw power. Her skin tingled with excitement like she&#39;d never felt 
before. When kissing, Rei was ready to take on anything and anyone. Not 
one but Minako could give her that feeling.

But this, it was the complete opposite. It was soothing and relaxing. 
Her mind stopped racing at the speed of light, slowing down at the 
lightest touch. She felt like there was no reason to be so charged, to 
be on her guard or really to do anything at all. She just wanted to 
simply be and let go of everything.

The roaring flame within died down, leaving behind warm, glowing embers.

She was very aware of Hotaru&#39;s touch yet at the same time, not. Rei knew 
it was because of this touch that she felt this way: it brought peace 
and tranquility to the busy world she lived in. And for that, she was 
thankful.

Hotaru&#39;s eyes softened when she realized Rei had fallen asleep. So 
beautiful. Of course, she had yet to stop touching Rei&#39;s face. Hell, 
seeing her peaceful and angelic expression made her want the fiery girl 
even more. This was why she kept far away before. Once she was able to 
touch, she would never be able to pull away.

But since Rei was asleep...

Hotaru&#39;s fingers traced the curve of Rei&#39;s nose. But this time, she 
didn&#39;t fall back into the routine of tracing her cheeks and then jaw.

She allowed herself to run her fingers over the lips she so craved. 
Full, curvy, pouty lips that were sculpted perfection. The contact sent 
shivers down her spine. Soft as rose petals and just as deep in color. 
Those lips alone should have been enough to win Rei the title of 
&#39;Goddess of Love.&#39; Let&#39;s not forget her many conquests, both men and 
women.

But then again, Rei Hino wouldn&#39;t be Rei Hino if she were the Goddess of 
Love. That would make her too gentle and tame. Not that Minako Aino was 
tame, not at all. But Rei was like a roaring fire, powerful and in your 
face. That&#39;s one of the reasons Hotaru liked her, actually.

Because she was so unlike herself. While she was quiet, Rei was loud. 
While she kept everything in, Rei spoke her mind, letting people know 
exactly what she was thinking. While it took a lot to anger Hotaru, the 
miko would be set off by a single wrong look or word. And when Hotaru 
did become angry, it is shown in a calm but deadly manner. Rei&#39;s anger 
was flat out explosive. True both their wraths were dangerous, but Rei 
forgave easily. Hotaru held onto everything, letting it eat her away 
slowly.

That&#39;s why she was who she was. After a few years of suppressing and 
keeping everything in, it was starting to take its toll on her. That was 
the reason why she admired Rei. Though cautious, the miko gave her trust 
openly and wholly to those who deserved it. She shared her burdens, 
though always careful of how much people should know to protect them.

Ami once said that the easiest way to self-destruction was to keep 
everything in. Anyone ever hear of implosion?

&#39;You have someone to take care of, don&#39;t think about this now.&#39;

Taking one last look at Rei, Hotaru stood and walked to the couch.</pre>
