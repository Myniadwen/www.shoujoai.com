<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Pwned.</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fuzzes on the  screen, then it clears to show us an indoor arena.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And now, in this  corner, he's fat, hairy, Italian, and a plumber: Mario!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The crowd cheers  loudly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And in this corner,  the Champion of Justice, Moon Princess, fifteen year old cry-baby-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I give you, SAILOR  MOON!!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The stands erupt in  loud cheers while men (and women) shout “WE LOVE YOU SAILOR MOON!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And one particular  voice shouts out, “USAGI AND REI FOR EVAAAAAA!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mario pouted, his bushy  mustache bouncing on his lip. “Nobody lovesa da pluma.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Moon and Mario  took up fighter's stances, the fans surprisingly quiet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“FIGHT!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“HIYAAA!” Mario  launched himself at our favorite heroine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Moon sighed and  grabbed a steel chair. “The things I do for authors…” she  murmured as she readied her chair like a baseball bat. As Mario  neared her, she swung with all of her might.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">CLANG!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oha shita!” Mario  screamed as he crashed through the ceiling. “Looksa like I'ma  blastin' off agaiaaaannnnnn!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mario flew through the  night sky, fading into the distance and into the stratosphere and  becoming a star.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The arena was very  quiet. Crickets chirped in the night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn!”  Tempestflame shouted as she pointed at the Mario shaped hole in the  wall. “Mario got pwned!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In this corner, he's  mean, he's lean, he's green! It's Beast Boy!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Girls squealed. Men  booed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's the pointy ears  baby.” Beast Boy grinned, tugging on his kawaii elfy ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And, SAILOR MOON!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">More loud cheering  erupts.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey! What happened  to my intro!?” Sailor Moon asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“FIGHT!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What the hell!?”  Sailor Moon shrieked as Beast Boy morphed into a bull and charged.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He slammed into her  stomach and she flew into the arena's wall with a pained gasp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the stands, several  men and women fainted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“YOU SON-OF-<strong><em>BITCH!!!”</em></strong> A new voice roared. Sailor Mars flew from the sidelines and tackled  Beast Boy, who had morphed back into his human form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“OH SHIT!!” he  squealed as Mars punched him in his jaw, sending him reeling to the  ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong><em>DON'T YOU  TOUCH HER</em></strong> <strong><em><u>AGAIN</u>!!!!</em></strong>” she screamed as  she slammed her foot…between his legs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Every guy in the room  whimpered and crossed his legs, while the girls winced.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Moon covered her  mouth with her hands as Mars stomped her foot. Repeatedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>With those heels  too…</em>She closed her eyes as Mars ground her heel into BB's  crotch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As security finally  arrived to take Mars away, the Fire Senshi screamed out,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“AND ANY GUY WHO  TRIES TO HIT ON HER WILL GET <strong><u><em>100 TIMES WORSE THAN THAT!!!</em></u></strong>”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beast Boy limped over  to Sailor Moon and grabbed her shoulders, shaking her roughly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Your girlfriend's  completely INSANE!!!” He shouted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong><em>FIRE SOUL!!!”</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“SHIT!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beast Boy was blasted  into outer space, much like Mario.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The arena was  completely silent. This time, the crickets didn't dare to chirp.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn,”  Tempestflame murmured, pointing at the Beast Boy shaped hole in the  roof. “BB got pwned.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yay!” LunerMiasma  cheered. “Usagi/Rei 4 eva!!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Static fizzes again  as the screen goes blank.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ramblings: And THAT my  friends, is the first chapter of my omake fic, Robot Senshi. It's  just like Robot Chicken, a HUGE parody thing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">LunarMiasma is my  internet sister on deviantART.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She, like me, is a huge  Usa/Rei fan. Thus, the hint of Usa/Rei in this omake.</span></p>
