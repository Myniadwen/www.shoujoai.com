<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Seven Days Without Minako<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  morning after Minako’s welcome back party, Rei woke up with a throbbing  headache and bleary eyes. She felt like she had a hangover. In reality,  she had to assume that Minako just had that effect on her.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  knew her best friend well. She had observed Minako’s critical eyes on  her several times the night before and it was clear that the singer had  known something was up. She had suspected that Rei was remembering  their past lives. But the question was, even if she would admit that  her best friend’s suspicions had been correct, what did Minako expect  from her? Did she expect Rei to jump into her arms and proclaim her  love for her? Rei snorted, and then frowned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No. That had been  Minako’s failing when they were younger, not her own. Rei would not be  swayed by decisions made in any past life and Minako knew as much. And  if her best friend did want something romantic out of her in this life,  a wild thought the miko couldn’t begin to hope was true, then where did  that leave her? Was that something <em>she</em> wanted?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a  groan, Rei rolled over and sat up. The rising sun was spilling its  golden orange light through the paper coverings on the windows. It was  a new day, and she had seven more before she’d get to see Minako again.  That was seven days time to sort things out, to learn more about her  past self and her past relationship and its impact to her feelings in  the present - seven days time to decide what her next move would be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei didn’t need psychic abilities to know it was going to be a long seven days.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was seething.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was the third time in as many hours that she’d caught her three novice  miko huddled in the courtyard, all crowded around one set of  headphones. By now, news of Minako’s Encore Finale concert had reached  even the sanctuary of her shrine, and she was wondering when she’d ever  hear the end of it. She cruelly imagined the looks of shock she might  receive if her young protégé were to learn that she already had tickets  to the main event, let alone backstage passes granted by the pop star  herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One of the girls waved to her from across the way, “Hino-sama! Isn’t Minako-chan the greatest?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned and furiously returned to sweeping the courtyard. Under her  breath she grumbled, “Yeah, if you mean the greatest, most stubborn  contradiction ever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars was seething.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>All too  quick to assign her troops to separate coordinates instead of  coordinating their abilities, Venus had divided them, and she didn’t  know she was walking into a trap. With a speed she hadn’t even been  aware of possessing, Mars flew across the undergrowth of a dense  forest. Deliberately disobeying direct orders from her commander, she  cursed under her breath. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I’m not doing this for </em>her<em>.  I’m doing this to prove that I have the better tactic.’ Even as her  stressed quads quivered and threatened to give out underneath her, the  Martian senshi repeated this mantra to herself as she found yet another  burst of speed. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>As she closed in on her leader, she  watched that infuriatingly beautiful blonde haired warrior as she  flipped, dodged, and attacked with a golden chain that had been secured  loosely around a slender waist. Slim, yet muscular legs flexed as she  dashed from droid to droid. Unaware of the ambush that lay in wait, she  picked off the low hanging fruit that were the decoys. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Behind you!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Venus  spun, affecting a deadly serious defensive position, but she didn’t  know what to be more shocked about; that six droids were rushing her,  only feet from her position, or that the flames of Mars were close  enough to singe the ends of her hair, taking down the four closest to  her. With no small amount of effort, she managed to recover her grace  and take down the remaining two with an attack of her own.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars slid in beside the other woman, placed her back to Venus’, and scanned the quiet wilderness pensively.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Venus calmed her shaking nerves and glared at Mars over her shoulder. “What are you doing?” She hissed.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Saving  your ass! You may be our leader, but no matter how stupid you are for  charging headlong into unknown territory after scattering your team to  the winds, I’m not going to sit around idly if I can save you!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>For the first time since she’d met their stubborn leader, Mars saw Venus at a loss for words. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  sudden rush shook the forest. Their cover blown, the remaining ten  droids didn’t hesitate to rush their prey, and they came at the two  senshi from all angles. Venus and Mars pressed up against one another,  and without fully understanding what they were doing, combined their  formidable strengths, causing the flames of Mars to mingle with the  light of Venus in a massive attack that should have been far beyond  their skill levels. A bright flash of light enveloped them, and when  they could see again, all that was left within a twenty foot diameter  was the blackened remains of the forest floor.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Venus was  suddenly acutely aware that she was still leaning against Mars’ back,  and made a show of standing on her own accord. “You… you had your  orders!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>To let you die out there if this was a real  battle?” Mars spun, but faltered when she found herself toe to toe with  her leader. Not finding the anger and hatred she’d been expecting,  there was a glimmer in those caramel eyes that she couldn’t comprehend,  and it frightened her. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Venus’ hand shook as it reached  towards her second in command’s face and her voice was a soft whisper  when she called the others’ name, “Reiko…” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars’ fists  clenched. She could fight any number of foes, but she didn’t know how  to deal with this pain inside her chest. She turned, and ran. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  novice miko unsteadily presented a small tray that held two delicate  cups. An unnoticed blush covered her face as she looked away from her  superior shyly. “Tea or hot chocolate, Hino-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Barely looking  up from the shrine documents she hadn’t really been paying attention to  in the first place, Rei nodded her thanks to the young girl. Reaching  her hand for the bitter green tea she was so accustomed to, she  suddenly changed course, grasping instead the small cup of chocolate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  young miko bowed slightly before taking her leave. Rei only stared at  the cup of still, brown liquid that warmed her chilled hand as though  she’d never seen it before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako caught the slight twitch of Reiko’s eye. “Too sweet for you?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reiko allowed herself to openly grimace. “What is it with you Venusians and chocolate?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>We  like our sweets.” Minako said coyly. Pinning the other woman with her  eyes, she leaned in and briefly captured the other woman’s lips with  her own before smoothly taking the cup of chocolate from Reiko’s hands.  With a glance over her shoulder, she winked and retreated to the  balcony. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>It doesn’t taste so bad when it’s on her  lips.’ The Martian stared after her leader and closest friend dumbly  for a moment before she could master control of her legs again in order  to follow the seductive vixen.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Swathed in the blue glow of  the Earth where it broke over the horizon, Minako sat with her legs  swung over the low railing that bordered the balcony outside her room,  her eyes trained on the beauty of the courtyard garden. But in Reiko’s  eyes, the exotic flowers, the elegant foliage, even the ornate statuary  of her surroundings paled in comparison to the beauty that was Venus.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Feeling  as though she were an intruder to the scene before her, Reiko  hesitantly approached the other woman. Stiffly, she sat next to Minako  with her legs on the opposite side of the railing. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>The palace is quiet tonight.” She tried awkwardly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Un.” Minako replied. They sat in silence for a moment before she leaned back into her best friend.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>It  was a cool evening, but as Reiko twined her arms comfortably around  Minako’s familiar waist, she realized that she had not only what she  needed to keep warm, but that she simply had all she needed. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  familiar tale of Kaguya-Hime completed, Rei closed the well worn book  her mother had often read to her as a child. Having digested the fairy  tale, the small group of young children that surrounded her all began  talking at once, to which the miko responded with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is there really a Princess of the moon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course there is.” Rei replied causally.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How do you know?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Because  I happen to know her personally.” Her smart remark was paired with a  pinch to the cheek of its asker, and when this gesture brought a blush  to his cheeks and laughter to the rest of the children, it was music to  her ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A group of blonde haired children scrambled over the  grassy hill and surrounded the usually formidable red fuku clad Sailor  Mars. She smiled patiently at the barrage of questions they had for  her. Kneeling down to their level, she addressed each of their  questions with a motherly indulgence. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Aren’t you the Princess of Mars?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Are you really friends with the Princess of the moon?” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>My big brother says you’re the strongest of the senshi. I want to be just like you when I grow up!” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Having  eventually gotten their fill, the children finally went on their way to  their next activity, leaving Mars watching after them, making sure they  each got down the hill uninjured. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Who’d have ever thought the senshi of fire would have such a soft spot for children?” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>That  singsong voice would have made her hackles rise even just a few short  weeks ago, but now, Mars didn’t even bother to hide her tender smile,  but only lifted an eyebrow at her companion warningly. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  senshi of love laughed melodically and sauntered over to her closest  friend. “Oh come now, Reiko,” She twined an arm around the slightly  taller woman’s waist and pulled her toward her to whisper in her ear,  “I find it absolutely adorable.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a  special tub on the shrine grounds for higher ranking members of the  shrine clergy. Miko though she still was, Rei had seniority on almost  any other there. It was an indulgence she rarely allowed herself, but  on a cold night like this, especially after several days of collecting  memories that were enlightening, frightening, and enticing all at the  same time, she was in need of some serious relaxation. It especially  hadn’t helped that the emotional rushes associated with each memory had  almost always given her a burst of energy that she would siphon into  her physical duties around the shrine, and as such, she hoped the  soothing waters would do her aching muscles a world of good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Then  again, after being up to the wee hours of the morning trying not to  think about Venus Minako or Aino Minako, not for not wanting to think  about her best friend, but simply for needing some precious sleep, <em>anything</em> would do her a world of good.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having  showered and cleansed her body first, Rei let her towel fall to the  floor before she slowly slipped into the hot water, but even in this  sacred place, her memories found her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reiko stared in reverent  worship as the Venusian princess climbed out of the tub. Resplendent in  her nakedness, the jasmine scented suds slid from Minako’s gleaming  body as their eyes met.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A knock came at the door, but neither woman flinched.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>My Princess, will you or the Princess Venus be needing any help with your gowns this evening?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No. We will not require assistance.” Reiko replied flatly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>And we won’t be attending the ball, either.” Minako added.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>As you wish, my ladies.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reiko  raised an eyebrow at her lover’s boldness and then grinned scandalously  before her attention returned to where it had previously been, for  Minako’s silky, black hair, she decided immediately, which was done up  in a tight twist at the top of her head, would be only the first thing  to come undone that night.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She didn’t know what she  was looking for. Maybe she was trying to trigger another memory. Maybe  she was just killing time, but when she found herself rummaging through  her closet, she finally realized what it was that she’d been searching  for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though it was magical in its powers, and when she’d been a  senshi she’d had the ability to summon it at will, its physical  presence had to reside somewhere. For the past five years, it had been  housed in a non descript cardboard box in the back of her closet. In  all its pink, girlish, garishness, Rei picked up her star tambourine  gently, knowing that for its tacky façade, it was the host of an  infinitely powerful weapon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that weapon had a twin that was even more powerful than her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  had felt that power once. When Minako had died, she had summoned her  leader’s weapon, and had felt Venus’ sword surging to life in her left  hand, resonating its power in harmony with its twin in her right.  Likewise, Venus had called on Rei’s sword barely a year ago, and though  Rei had been unable to participate in the battle against Kuroki Mio,  she had surrendered what little power she’d possessed to her leader.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d been with Minako in heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Wait, Mars. I want you to take me with you.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars  spun and wished she hadn’t, for seeing her bruised and bloodied leader  lying prone on the hospital bed only cracked at her defenses. It was  all she could do to keep from breaking, let alone give in to any whim  Minako desired. She bit her lip and straightened. She had to be the  leader now, until Minako regained her strength. They’d discussed this  very scenario, but she could have never prepared herself for it.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>No, Minako. Don’t make me say it again.” She barked.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars  flinched when she felt Minako’s cold hand take her own, her fingers  twining with hers briefly, but when the other woman retracted her hand,  she felt a foreign object in the wake of the familiar touch. When she  looked down to find Minako’s tambourine held loosely in her fingers,  her mouth hung open slightly.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Take me with you through  this.” Minako summoned a brave smile for her second in command, to  which Mars managed a desperate nod in return. “Now go. I expect a  briefing on the results of the mission at 1800 hours.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars stood tall and mastered the sideways smirk she’d learned from her leader. “I’ll have my report to you shortly.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Lining up the last number, Rei put the finishing touches on the shrine’s budget report.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  a long day of shrine duties and meditation, the miko had found herself  suckered into working in the office on the shrine’s administrative  documents for most of the night. Having capitalized on her stay, her  elders had taken the opportunity for an evening out on the town,  leaving her to their dirty work.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A rumble of her stomach reminded  her that she’d forgotten dinner. Clicking off the lamp at the low desk,  she pulled away from the warmth of the kotatsu and padded down the  empty, quiet halls to the kitchen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The options presented by the  refrigerator proved as exciting as the budget report; some raw  vegetables, some old rice and a carton of milk. Perhaps they should  have sent her to the grocery store instead of handing her the paperwork.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  little hope, she opened the freezer. When she started laughing at its  lone content; a sad, freezer burned bag of eggrolls, her first thought  was that the numbers had driven her crazy.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The long haired woman frowned at the two greasy tubes in disgust. “What is that?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her glamorous companion giggled as she sauntered into the moon palace’s kitchen. “Silly, they’re called eggrolls.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Is it food?” Reiko asked, on the heels of her leader.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako’s long suffering roll of her eyes was overly dramatic. “Yes, my suspicious one.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>From that dreadful planet, I assume?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Oh,  Reiko, the Earth isn’t that bad.” Minako thrust the plate at her second  in command expectantly and picked up a magazine that had been left on  the countertop to idly flip through its pages. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Her  stomach was at odds with her mind, and though it did smell good, Reiko  warily popped their dinner into the food warmer with a certain amount  of hesitation. Quickly loosing interest, she glanced at her best friend  from the corner of her eye and became transfixed as a lock of silky,  black hair fell over Minako’s bare shoulder, coming to rest right above  her breast. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The senshi of love released a squeal of  surprise that was hushed by familiar lips. Her magazine fell to the  floor forgotten as her lover’s arms slipped around her waist and she  was pushed back against the edge of the counter. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Someone  might see us.” Minako’s words were a quiet whisper in Reiko’s ear. It  was a statement with no inflection, nor was it laced with fear. Ever  practical, she was simply identifying a possibility. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I,”  Reiko kissed the corner of Minako’s mouth, “don’t,” she nipped Minako’s  bottom lip with her teeth, “care.” Finally, she fully claimed  possession of the other woman’s lips.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The Venusian moaned  into her lover’s mouth as Reiko’s fingertips teased the hem of her  shirt before slipping underneath to caress the smooth skin of her hip,  eventually sliding up the flatness of her belly, and then, as Minako’s  knee came to rest between Reiko’s legs, settling just below the swell  of her breasts-</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Reiko paused, her lips hovering over the nape of Minako’s neck. “Do you smell something?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>The eggrolls!” The two girls shouted in tandem, only to look to the food warmer to find flames consuming their dinner.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  senshi of love acted quickly, extinguishing the fire with a towel.  Wearing a wide grin on her lips, Minako tossed the incriminating  evidence in the trash before returning to the awkward arms of her best  friend. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The senshi of fire looked away somewhat  sheepishly, the blush on her cheeks a toss up between embarrassment and  arousal, but when Minako took Reiko’s hands, still tingling with the  feel of her lover’s skin, and placed them where they’d been only  moments before, the Martian smiled and effortlessly found her pace  again.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>That’s my little pyro.” Minako purred.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  newfound reminiscences weren’t all so enlightening or heart warming.  There was something else, something darker and more confusing that  continued to drive her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After six days of trickle down memories,  the miko had found herself in the fireroom on almost a daily basis,  that lingering prickle of something missing, a particular vision of a  wounded Venus and a warning Mars, that had driven her to long bouts of  searching for answers before the flame, each time to no avail. As the  acidic scent of sulfur she’d come to associate with the well-hidden  memory faded from her senses once again, Rei realized she’d failed this  time, too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the fire wasn’t done with her yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  she was standing under a black, starless sky, beneath the angled roof  of a stadium. She was numb, unseeing, unfeeling. She could sense her  friends at her back, their question was obvious; <em>where was their leader?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then, her voice was raw and not her own, and when the flames of Mars  ignited her transformation, she briefly wondered if the fire of her  fury would eat her alive. She wasn’t so lucky. Instead, she attacked  with a ferocity she hadn’t been capable of harnessing ever before, and  when their foes had been eliminated, she had felt herself shaking like  a leaf as she fell to her knees, crying out her name,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mi…na…ko!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  forcibly severed her link with the sacred flame and collapsed forward,  resting on her arms. Her raven hair cascading over her shoulders,  falling in her wide, frightened eyes, she wondered why the fire would  return her to the single most painful moment in her life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako had been the first to die in this life. Did that mean anything to their past lives?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mars, retreat!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She felt the briefest of connections, but couldn’t quite make the link.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Instead,  she collapsed backwards, exhausted. Laying on her back, looking through  the open shoji screen doors, the cold winter air chilled her damp skin  and she cursed herself for having left the them open in the first  place. Too tired to amend the situation, she settled for looking at the  world from her upside down vantage point, where the setting sun was  caught in the craggy claws of the barren maples. The quiet babbling of  a distant koi pond eased her ragged nerves, if only a small amount.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  had been almost a week since Minako had returned to Japan, and in that  time, Rei had accomplished what she’d planned to do. She’d waited, and  she’d learned. She’d come to understand her past life. And although  she’d regained other memories as well; ones more… mundane; memories of  her comrades Jupiter and Mercury, her beloved Princess Serenity, her  honorable Queen, and their teachers, Luna and Artemis, all these  memories paled in comparison to the importance of the relationship that  Reiko and Minako had shared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she’d found that the knowledge  of their relationship hadn’t affected her own original attraction to  her best friend, the attraction she’d felt for Minako five years ago  that had steadily grown ever since. The attraction she had never acted  on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But now what? So she was as, if not more, attracted to her  best friend than ever. That still didn’t change the fact that she  didn’t know what Minako wanted. She still didn’t know why Minako had  wanted her to remember her past life.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her best friend had  remained as unreadable in this life as she had in the past, but if she  was to believe that Minako wanted the same thing she wanted, where did  that leave her? For no matter how badly she seemed to long for Minako,  the mere thought of letting anyone, even her best friend, get that  close to her, was a frightening thought for Rei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now, the concert was tomorrow. But was she ready to face Minako again?</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, Aino-chan! One more time from the top!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  grit her teeth, plastered a smile onto her lips that didn’t reach her  eyes, and stepped back up to the microphone. Aside from the fact that  she’d steadily gotten more and more fed up with the exhaustion of  touring, of singing the same songs over and over, of dealing with the  same routine in a different city all the time, this wasn’t the cause of  Minako’s restless anxiety.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With her Encore Finale concert less  than twenty four hours away, all she could think about was Hino Rei.  Had she done the right thing by giving the miko space to think things  through on her own? Could this be their chance to finally address their  feelings or was she only setting herself up for a painful rejection?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Was her tactic working, or would it only backfire?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only one thing was certain, and it was a conclusion Minako didn’t want to accept; only time would tell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I’m  a little mixed on this chapter. Although I like each memory and think  they add to the overall plot, I don’t like how fragmented the overall  chapter is. Actually, I think this entire chapter is just an excuse for  the eggroll scene. It was one of the single most enjoyable scenes I’ve  ever written. . In all though, I feel like you guys got jipped with  this chapter.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chapter 6 Preview:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  smiled softly and rested her hand lightly on Rei’s thigh. “It’s late,  and it’s cold. Why don’t we go back to my place and-&quot; Minako could feel  the miko’s muscles quivering under hand. “Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The long haired woman finally looked her best friend in the eye. “You were right. My past is returning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer fought back a gasp at hearing the one thing she’d waited to hear for what had seemed like endless years. “Then you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  forged forward, feeling that she had to get this out now or she’d never  say it at all. “And I’m sorry that… you’ve been calling to me all this  time and I’ve never really listened until now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>An apology?’</em> Minako asked herself with wide eyes. The miko never apologized! The singer’s mind raced and got the better of her. <em>‘Could Rei and I be on the same page after all this time?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s voice was a whisper. “Reiko…”</span></p>
