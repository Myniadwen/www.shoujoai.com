<p>A few hours later at the Hikawa Temple, Rei turned on the lamp in  her room. It was already dark and she was exhausted from the full day  she spent with the senshi, especially when Minako dragged her along to  go shopping for Usagi. After dressing into her pajamas, Rei collapsed  on her futon and placed a pillow on top of her face.</p>
<p>“Exhausted, eh?” asked Minako as she entered the room and sat beside the miko.</p>
<p>Rei peeked from the pillow and said, “How do you do it?”</p>
<p>“Do what?”</p>
<p>“Shopping.”</p>
<p>Minako laughed, “Don’t tell me that Hino Rei is not used to shopping!”</p>
<p>“It’s  not easy you know. My chores are easier than that,” replied Rei as she  threw the pillow at Minako. She frowned as it smothered her face.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan.  I’ve had a little share of your chores and they are not easy,” Minako  threw the pillow back. Rei laughed at the comment, perhaps because she  has done those chores since her childhood.</p>
<p>“I guess we really come from different planets.”</p>
<p>“Literally. <em>Mars Reiko-san</em>.”</p>
<p>Rei  winced when she heard the name. It reminded her of singing, and she  hated karaoke. Minako settled beside Rei and the miko looked at her.</p>
<p>“There is an extra futon you know.”</p>
<p>“I’m  much too lazy to get up. Already comfortable where I am.” In truth,  Minako loved to annoy Rei. She thought it was cute whenever the miko  would frown<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<hr />
Mamoru looked at the time as he walked  through the busy streets of London. The time difference between London  and Tokyo was menacing. It was very hard for him to call Usagi at the  right time, and now more than ever he wanted to hear her voice. She had  just recently told him about her condition and he was distraught about  the news. He could even barely pay attention during work.
<p>He walked  into his small apartment and sat on the couch, wondering whether or not  Usagi was even awake. Finally after just sitting and staring at his  phone, he began to dial the numbers.</p>
<p>“Mushi mushi?”</p>
<p>“Usagi?”</p>
<p>““Hmm? ... Ah. Mamo-chan…what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“I miss you.” He heard her yawn, and then there was a slight moment of silence, “I guess you were asleep?”</p>
<p>“Gomen. The girls were here all day.”</p>
<p>“Ah I see. I’m sure you enjoyed yourself. Well, I’ll let you go then. You sound exhausted.”</p>
<p>Usagi yawned again. “No, don’t go. I like hearing your voice. Just stay on the phone with me until I fall asleep, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hai. Usagi?”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>“I love you too Mamoru.”</p>
<p>He stayed on the phone, glad to hear her voice. Once he heard Usagi snoring, he smiled and said, “Bye then. Good night.”</p>
<hr />
Makoto  and Ami headed towards Crown Karaoke. Nearing the end of December, it  started to get colder these days. Makoto saw a cloud of vapor escape  her mouth as she exhaled. From a distance, they saw Motoki waving at  them. There was also another person who stood next to him and Ami  waved. It was Nephrite looking rather grumpy as usual. However, he  smiled when he caught sight of Ami.
<p>“Ready?” he asked.</p>
<p>Ami smiled at him, “Hai.” He took hold of her hand and started to head out. Motoki and Makoto followed behind them.</p>
<p>“So how’s Usagi-chan?” asked Motoki.</p>
<p>“She’s doing fine, although she tires easily now. It worries me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sure she’ll pull through,” reassured Motoki as he held Makoto closer.</p>
<p>Ami  heard the light conversation and joined in, “Of course she will make it  Mako-chan. She’s Usagi.” Nephrite looked at her then back at the couple  and nodded.</p>
<p>Makoto looked at him and nodded back. Nephrite  changed a lot ever since he and Ami started seeing each other. Other  than the fact that they went from allies to enemies to friends made  Makoto try to get used to the idea of Ami even being with him. However,  she knew that he was good to her, despite his hot-temperedness when he  was with the other Shitennou. Ami reassured her friends that inside his  exterior, Nephrite is actually a little softy. <em>I guess this is  alright. I remember in the past life how Nephrite showed a rather  strong interest for Mercury. Ha. I guess parts of our past tend to  repeat itself. Take Usagi and Mamoru as living proof of that.</em></p>
<hr />
The  next day, Ami helped Rei with her preparations for the New Year’s  festival for the temple. Makoto was also at the temple, along with  Minako. They were all dressed in similar miko outfits as Rei, which  brought a little bit of nostalgia for both Makoto and Ami.
<p>“I still  do not understand how you do not tire from this Rei,” said Makoto. Rei  shrugged as she was trying to complete her tasks, “I guess I was raised  that way.” She looked at Minako, who sighed as she was struggling with  her own task. Rei giggled as she observed the idol getting more and  more frustrated.</p>
<p>“Ah, well. When are we going to get Usagi-chan?”  asked Makoto. She was very eager to finish her assigned job. Last time  she had done this, she was too preoccupied with yelling at Usagi on the  phone that she caused a rather chaotic mess in the end.</p>
<p>“Oh,  she’s excited to go out. Already dressed and everything. She told us to  call as soon as we are finished,” answered Ami. Her mother had given  them permission to take Usagi out, since she was to have the surgery  the next day. They had also planned a surprise for her.</p>
<p>“Then let’s get a move on!” exclaimed Minako.</p>
<p>Once they were finished, all four senshi dressed out of their miko robes and headed towards the car.</p>
<p>“Ja ne. We’ll meet you at Crown Karaoke then?” said Rei as she began to walk with Minako.</p>
<p>“Hai. Ami-chan and I are going to airport to pick up Mamoru. He was so excited to come home,” said Makoto.</p>
<p>“Usagi-chan will be so happy,” finished Ami as both groups went their separate ways.</p>
<p>On  the way towards Narita Airport, Makoto spotted Motoki walking past them  towards a small shop. She was a bit puzzled by this little discovery,  but drove on.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan, should we have an Welcome Back Party for Usagi-chan? Perhaps after she recovers from the surgery.”</p>
<p>Makoto  was silenced by this idea. She still had pained memories for when they  tried to throw an Iterashai Party for Minako. Ami noticed her reaction  and said, “Well, I know it is a bit scary. But we should celebrate when  Usagi gets through this.”</p>
<p>“IF Usagi-chan gets through it Ami-chan”</p>
<p>“No. WHEN. Usagi will survive this. I know it. Why are you so pessimistic about it?”</p>
<p>“It’s  not pessimism, I’m just…scared. I don’t want things repeating itself,”  finished Makoto as they pulled over the curb. Mamoru waved at them and  they got out of the car.</p>
<p>“How’s Usagi? I can’t wait to see her,”  said Mamoru. He was merely gone for five days, and came back to Tokyo.  Apparently, his worry got the best of him and he wanted to be there  when Usagi would wake up from her surgery.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan and  Rei-chan are picking her up. Oh I can’t wait to see the look on her  face when she sees you!” said Ami. They helped him with his bags and  began to drive towards their beloved Crown Karaoke.</p>
<p>Usagi was  restless inside Minako’s car. She always seemed to have the same  reaction no matter how many times she’s been in it. Minako could simply  giggle whenever she saw this.</p>
<p>Rei sighed, “Usagi. Keep still, we’re almost there.”</p>
<p>“I  can’t help it Rei-chan. It has been a while since I’ve been able to see  the outdoors,” Usagi started to look outside the window when she bumped  her head.</p>
<p>“Ow ow ow ow!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>“See what I mean,” said Rei as she looked worriedly at her friend.</p>
<p>“Ah,  here we are,” said Minako as she parked the car. They both got out and  helped Usagi inside the building. “Mako-chan and Ami-chan are already  waiting for us.”</p>
<p>As they walked inside, Motoki and Makoto greeted  them. It seemed like they were talking for a while, because they each  were sipping on a glass of hot chocolate. Makoto smiled.</p>
<p>“You go on, Ami-chan is waiting inside.”</p>
<p>Usagi  walked towards the hidden door and opened it when Ami greeted her at  the entrance. Usagi walked down the staircase with the help of her  friends and they helped her settle on the couch. Just then the lights  suddenly turned off, and Usagi looked around confused. Finally, the  lights went back on and everyone in the room was gone.</p>
<p>“Eh?  Rei-chan? Mako-chan? Ami-chan? Minako-chan? We’re did everyone go?  Don’t tell me you’re leaving me alone here!” Music began to play and  she heard a familiar voice singing in the background. She turned  towards where the voice came and found that it was Mamoru, making his  way down the staircase with the microphone in his hand. He sang rather  smoothly and never left his eyes on Usagi. She was rather surprised and  he was finally in front of her.</p>
<p>Usagi smiled as Mamoru bent down  to her eye level. She wrapped her arms around him and began to cry. She  was so happy to see him and to even inhale his very scent made her  smile even more. “Mamo-chan. Aren’t you supposed to be in London?”</p>
<p>He  looked at her and said, “I asked if I could go back to Tokyo. I  couldn’t stand being away from you, especially at this time. I love you  Usagi-chan, and I want to always be here for you.”</p>
<p>Their faces  were so close to each other now, that Usagi felt the warmth of his  breath. She looked into his eyes that gave her so much courage and  comfort. He could kiss her any moment now. Their lips were getting  closer and Usagi closed her eyes.</p>
<p>“Ahhh! Mako-chan!” yelled  someone. Usagi and Mamoru stopped and turned towards the closet door.  All four girls came tumbling into the floor. Rei was in the bottom with  Minako, while Ami was trying her best to get up. Makoto was rubbing her  head and knew that a bump would form. Usagi and Mamoru sighed as they  saw the sight.</p>
<p>“Gomen Mamoru. The lights went off too fast and we just hid in the closest available spot.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, it was too small for all of us to fit,” said Rei as she frowned at Makoto.</p>
<p>“My fault? It’s not my fault that I’m tall!”</p>
<p>“Well, if my calculations were correct we should have been able to fit,” said Ami.</p>
<p>“Gomen. That was my fault. I couldn’t hold it in anymore. That feather duster was tickling me,” said Minako.</p>
<p>“Feather duster, eh? Are you sure it wasn’t Rei-chan?” said Makoto smugly.</p>
<p>“MAKO-CHAN!”  yelled Minako as she began to blush. She turned towards the miko and  found her blushing as well. Usagi shook her head, No matter how old we  get, I have a feeling that our goofiness will never change. It’s  actually comforting to know that, but at the same time, a very scary  thought.</p>
<hr />
Makoto sat in her chair as she began to nurse the  already forming bump on her head. She winced whenever it stung, and  frowned at Minako, who could only smile nervously at her and then look  away. Rei was still trying to get over the fact that she was still  blushing. She kept fanning herself with her hands in an attempt to keep  herself cool. Ami sat quietly and looked around the room. Mamoru and  Usagi were actually excused themselves from the room, while trying not  to laugh at the situation.
<p>“I told you that closet was too small,” said Rei finally.</p>
<p>“Aw.  You know you liked it Rei. Having Minako soooo close to you,” said  Makoto with a mischievous smile. Minako blushed even more, because she  recalled that once the lights went off, her and Rei were the first ones  to run in. However, in no means were they doing anything other than  trying squeeze in more so that Makoto could fit.</p>
<p>“Mako-chan. Stop bullying the them,” said Ami.</p>
<p>“I’m just teasing. It’s cute when they’re like this,” she answered, “Oh alright. Gomen Rei-chan, Minako-chan.”</p>
<p>Rei  glared at her with arms crossed and Makoto gulped. Finally, Rei sighed  and softened a bit. “Whatever. It’s over and done with. Shall we go  then?”</p>
<p>“Going? To where?” asked Usagi as she entered the room once more.</p>
<p>“It’s New Year’s Eve Usagi-chan. I’m sure you would like to see the festivals, eh?”</p>
<p>She looked at all her friends and then shook her head.</p>
<p>“No. Actually I just want to see the fireworks and spend time with you guys.”</p>
<p>“Is that what you really want?”</p>
<p>“Hai,” answered Usagi, “I never wanted a big event, just a simple one with you guys.”</p>
<p>“Well,  my penthouse is just around the corner. How about we go there instead.  You can see a clear view of the fireworks from the balcony.”</p>
<p>Everyone  decided to go to Minako’s place and spend time there until the  countdown was to being. As she opened the door to her place, everyone  was in awe. The place was extremely nice and spacey. Mamoru and Usagi  settled in the couch, as Ami and Makoto started to explore the place.  Motoki sat in the couch nearby Mamoru and Usagi.</p>
<p>“Ah, Usagi-chan. Happy to see Mamoru-kun eh?”</p>
<p>“Hai. Just spending time with the people I love is enough for me.”</p>
<p>She  smiled as she placed her head on Mamoru’s shoulder. This is nice. I  don’t need things to be fancy, just being able to see them before the  surgery is enough. To see them carefree and happy, I want to keep this  memory for tomorrow as I go in for the surgery.</p>
<p>The countdown  began and everyone was listening intently to the radio station.  Finally, after the ten anticipated seconds, it was the New Year. Usagi  smiled, as her friends began to cause a lot of noise. Fireworks started  to shower the sky from Minako’s window and everyone rushed outside to  see them. Mamoru held Usagi, who was wrapped with a blanket and they  sat down together. The view was breathtaking. Usagi smiled, as she  looked at everyone before her. They were jumping up and down in  excitement, Motoki holding Makoto in his arms. <em>I want to keep this memory with me forever</em>, thought Usagi. She felt the warmth of Mamoru’s body pressed against hers and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Rei  felt a familiar tension in her gut and her eyes widened. Minako sensed  something was wrong the moment she saw the miko’s expression. <em>Something is not right…fading rapidly. No.</em> Rei slowly turned around and saw Usagi’s eyes closed. Her body looked  limp and lifeless. Rei and Minako slowly walked up to their friend and  bent down to her eye level.</p>
<p>“Usagi-chan?” asked Rei softly as she  held the girl’s hand. Usagi was barely breathing. Mamoru was now trying  to wake her up, but she wouldn’t open her eyes. Everyone started to  notice the situation and stood frozen in their places from dread.</p>
<p>“Usagi?”  asked Rei once more, but this time her voice sounded desperate. Minako  tried to shake the girl to wake up, but Usagi’s eyes would not open.</p>
<p><em>Please. Wake up. Please…</em></p>
