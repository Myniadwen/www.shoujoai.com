Hi!

I guess it&#39;s my turn this time around. Well, you already know what 
this is about. This entry is about the events after the rest of us 
have been reawakened and introducing Hotaru to the group. Of course 
we couldn&#39;t get any rest. But before I take away anything, on with 
the show... err, read.

(Mamoru)
The quiet of the morning had something truly magical that had nothing 
to do with transformation phrases or energy attacks. It was a peace 
that was like the quiet before the storm. Soon people would filter 
out into the streets, running around like a horde of ants, They would 
all attend to their own business, most of them only concerned with 
their own problems, unaware of what is going on around them. 
Responsibility contained for them of doing their work as expected and 
maybe taking care of a family. They had no idea what responsibility 
was all about.
	I loved those hours of early dawn when the air was clean and 
full of promises, the day untouched and still vivid. Maybe it was 
because of my calling, my bonds to the Earth, maybe it was just 
simply a time where I could relax and reflect in peace, without the 
stress of the day pushing me onwards. It was no different this 
morning when I found myself on the small balcony of my apartment 
building, looking out at the still mostly sleeping city. My thoughts 
were on yesterday&#39;s events and the changes those events had brought. 
My thoughts were also on the sweet odango-haired girl dozing on my 
couch where we must have fallen asleep yesterday.
	Everything was happening so quickly. Yesterday morning I had 
fretted over a single date setup with Usagi and now she had already 
stayed over - not that anything else had happened. The memories 
spinning in my head were like a kaleidoscope of colors. Of a normal 
life as a university student of Azabu-Juuban, of a time as a lone 
knight in the night, out to seek his own past only to find it 
revealed and taken from him in the most brutal ways imaginable. 
Memories of Usagi, annoying but somehow cute, always good for a 
teasing, memories of a strong warrior with much heart  that always 
urged my protectiveness. Memories of a princess and a love that 
should not have been and yet had lasted into this lifetime.
	I think... No, I knew I loved her. If she could find it in 
her heart to love me completely as she obviously did, that was the 
very least I could offer her. My own love. What she had said to me in 
the imaginary Moon Palace yesterday... I wanted to do this for a long 
time. There will never be a nicer guy than you. She had remembered. 
Just like that time at the north pole, in her arms... I still 
remembered it clearly, cherished it. She had saved me despite 
everything I had done under Beryl&#39;s influence. Was there a stronger 
proof for love? If so I was honestly sure Usagi would have 
accomplished it as well.
	It was just all so sudden, so... new? No. That wasn&#39;t the 
right word. After all Serenity and Endymion had known each other for 
a long time already. Most of it spent in memories and waiting to see 
each other again. Then I thought about it more. The periods where we 
had each other were actually always only glimpses, fractions of time. 
The secret and short-lived romance ended by the fall of the Silver 
Millennium, the treasured moments with Usagi, neither of us really 
knowing what this attraction really meant, the realization followed 
by the capture, the healing followed by my death and Usagi&#39;s near-
sacrifice. Now it looked like we finally would have some time 
together but I could neither really believe it yet nor was I sure 
what to do with it. To make it precise. Would we survive a normal 
relationship in the modern world? Would our relationship ever be 
normal anyway...?
	What Queen Serenity said bothered me as well. Power like 
Usagi? That was unlikely and yet could I actually doubt her? The 
roses and skills had to come from somewhere. Endymion hadn&#39;t been a 
prince for nothing and in a magical period of time like the Silver 
Millennium he was inclined to have more serious powers, especially as 
a prince. It was nerve-wrecking, my memories of that time were just 
so thin and blurry. Most of what I remembered was about Serenity and 
me. My kingdom, my people, important events they were only fleeting 
glimpses of the actual happenings.
	The thing was I wanted to believe the Queen. I wanted to be 
an equal partner for Usagi, yet I feared that maybe I wasn&#39;t ready to 
accept all the responsibility that came with my past again. I knew my 
life would change as soon as I accepted that I was a prince and most 
likely future King of Earth... This really is nothing a normal 
university student at my age has to put up with.
	&quot;Mamo-chan?&quot; Snapped out of my thoughts I looked sideways at 
Usagi who had silently stepped next to me. I had been so engrossed in 
my thoughts, I could not tell how long she had been standing there 
already. Usagi had changed as well. A lot actually. She was much 
calmer and even a little more mature. She had developed from the 
clumsy fourteen year-old I had first met in both the first and the 
repeated year. The blonde certainly hadn&#39;t lost anything that made 
her so incredibly charming, it was more likely disposing of some of 
the worse character attributes. I was wondering how the sudden 
reawakening would affect her.
	&quot;It&#39;s nothing, Usako. I was just thinking.&quot; After a short 
pause, I turned and stepped into the apartment again. &quot;Why don&#39;t we 
eat something.&quot; Of course, as soon as you mentioned food Usagi would 
still develop back to an excited seven year-old...
	I smiled warmly.

(First gong)
Scenes fades up on the surface of a hilly land, covered with vivid 
green grass and a field of flowers. We see Usagi standing in the 
center in her princess gown but without the Crescent Moon sigil, 
Mamoru is standing off to the side in a black suit, watching her with 
a quiet smile.

(Second gong)
The camera swings around, capturing Minako and Hotaru sitting and 
leaning against each other in the flower field. Minako has an arm 
around Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and Hotaru&#39;s head is on her right shoulder, 
their fingers interlocked and eyes half-closed.

(Third gong)
The camera swings yet again towards Ami, Rei and Makoto a short 
distance away from the couples, enjoying the weather. Ami against a 
tree, reading, Rei dozing off in the sun and Makoto, chasing Artemis 
for some reason, while Luna sits nearby shaking her head.
(First notes up to lyrics)
The scene fades black shortly and then shows Usagi/Serenity rising 
into the sky, transforming into Sailormoon in the process, Tuxedo 
Kamen right beside her. The familiar shape of the Moon comes into 
view and the surface draws closer as the pair descend, showing the 
ruins of the fallen Moon Kingdom. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter join them 
shortly, as does Venus without Hotaru, Luna and Artemis to their 
respective partner&#39;s feet. The season logo is slowly drawn over the 
assembled senshi.

(Gomen ne sunao janakute)
(Yume no naka nara ieru)
(Shikou kairo wa shooto sunzen)
(Ima sugu aitai yo)
                       
We see Ami with a book in her hand walking down a street, before she 
looks and turns around to face the screen. The sign of Mercury 
flashes on her forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a 
translucent image of Sailormercury.
Rei can be seen with her back to the screen, working on something at 
the Jinja. Phobos and Deimos fly into the scene and perch upon Rei&#39;s 
shoulders. The miko turns around and the sign of Mars flashes on her 
forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image 
of Sailormars.
Makoto can be seen working out, her motions flowing flawlessly into 
each other. She suddenly halts in mid-motion and turns her head to 
face the camera. The sign of Jupiter flashes on her forehead and her 
form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image of Sailorjupiter.

(Nakitaku naru you na moonlight)
Denwa mo dekinai midnight)
(Datte junjou doushiyou)
(Haato wa mangekyou)

Minako can be seen with jogging clothes, running down a street, sweat 
pouring from her forehead. She comes closer and the scene is suddenly 
frozen with a close-up on Minako, the sign of Venus on her forehead 
and the translucent layer of her senshi identity. The screen splits, 
leaving Minako frozen in place and showing now Hotaru in her room, 
lit by various candles and lamps, kneeling in a circle of the former. 
Her hair is hanging down and half-covers the concentration on her 
face. Suddenly darkness engulfs the room as well as Minako in the 
other scene. Hotaru desperately reaches out towards the other. For a 
moment her eyes turn blank and emotionless, the sign of Saturn 
flashes briefly on her forehead and her form is overlaid by the 
translucent image of Sailorsaturn, before everything turns black.

(Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare)
(Nando mo meguriau)

A group of four shadows becomes more detailed on the background of 
darkness. A brown-blond haired man, a redheaded pig-tailed one, a 
dark haired, very tall and heavy man and a light blue-haired one that 
looked remarkably female. A &quot;shadow&quot; can be seen looming over the 
four like a cloak covering a head.
Two points of light suddenly disrupt the darkness. On the left (,) 
the Silver Crystal can be seen and on the right, another teardrop-
shaped crystal. A thin line of violet slashes through the middle of 
the screen and shows Serenity and Endymion on the left side, Saturn 
and Venus on the right. Serenity holds the Silver Crystal high into 
the air, while Endymion supports her with one arm, the other on the 
sword hilt. Venus has the tear-shaped crystal in both hands and 
Saturn swings the Silence Glaive a few times for emphasis.

A brief flash shows Sailorpluto at the Time Gate looking worriedly 
upon the scene.
                       
(Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue)
(Onaji kuni ni umareta no)
(Mirakuru romansu)

Scene shifts to the Moon once again. Among the ruins, a large, black 
structure can be seen, vaguely resembling a military base. The scene 
shows the Senshi again, running side by side on the surface of the 
Moon, being assaulted by various Youma and other things... The 
Princess&#39;s guard jumps into the air, Mercury sending a stream of 
water and Jupiter a barrage of lightning combined into the enemy 
rows, Mars ignites a few more and Venus slashes through several 
opponents with a four-bladed, cross-like weapon out of pure 
crystalline light.
The scene shifts to an image of the Moon again, hanging loosely in 
black space. A blue, red and green star appears to the left, an 
orange and violet one to the right. In the middle, a bright silver 
and golden star joins the others. The stars are transformed into the 
Inner Senshi, Moon, Tuxedo Kamen and Hotaru, standing beside Venus on 
the right, a translucent image of Saturn hovering over her. The image 
of the intact Moon Palace is added to the background. Pluto appears 
above the group with the Time Staff raised; the Garnet Orb flashes a 
bright crimson and the scene freezes.

(Hotaru)
I had been awake for awhile, safely curled in slender arm that yet 
held a strength you would not believe simply from looking. No, you 
had to experience it. And experience I did, last night had been 
enough testament to this. I could still feel my body ache somewhat. 
However, it was not as bad as you would expect from what transpired 
on usual mating nights. The energy boost helped a lot.
	It was safe here. In her arms, that strong, dominating 
embrace that was in its own way one of the strongest expressions of 
protection and love, I could be free here. An odd paradox. I needed 
to be emotionally bonded to someone else before I could feel and 
experience freedom. Nobody would ever truly understand what made us 
work because no one would ever truly understand us as much as we did 
each other. When I was with Minako I felt completed and even in this 
short time we had been together I could safely tell that were was no 
one who could make me feel as important as the blonde Senshi.
	&quot;Hmm, morning, Anata...&quot; I smiled softly. She hadn&#39;t called 
me that in a long time and a warm feeling spread throughout my body, 
enveloping my heart and staying there safely wrapped around it like a 
welcomed cloak on cold winter nights. &quot;Morning to you too,&quot; I said 
and yawned. Minako shifted behind me: &quot;Tired?&quot; she asked. &quot;Mmh... You 
wore me out.&quot; My lover chuckled. &quot;I doubt that is even possible.&quot; I 
swatted the arm around me and then turned in her arms to come face to 
face with the girl who had captured my heart without a chance of ever 
releasing it again. Not that I wanted her to, of course. &quot;Why don&#39;t 
we test that theory?&quot; I purred and before Minako could reply, leaned 
forward to brush my lips against hers.
	The kiss was sensual, not heated, but enough to ignite that 
certain spark in me. She always managed to do that. I had really not 
thought to have a relationship that was as much on an emotional as a 
physical level so soon. Hell, with my prior constitution I doubted 
that anybody would have ever wanted to do the things with me we had 
done last night. It did not matter that in my mind I was already 
matured enough to compete with almost anyone, my body had always been 
a problem. However, Minako had not cared about it that night in 
England, nor the ones following. And again I felt unbelievable 
special.
	Not that you get the wrong idea. We weren&#39;t sex-crazed or 
something like that. This was just a physical extension of the bond 
we shared. It went beyond simple comprehension and most of it we 
didn&#39;t even understand ourselves. The mating was wild and powerful. 
Competing with someone like Minako on this level was an experience 
you had to make yourself to understand. I just wished that I was 
older already and we wouldn&#39;t have to do this in secret more often 
than we liked. Society in my opinion was too narrow-minded in this 
regard. Physical age doesn&#39;t always equals maturity. There were a lot 
of other factors coming into play. And I don&#39;t think I could stand up 
to Venus high on the wave of Senshi lust if I wasn&#39;t mature enough, 
right?
	&quot;A tempting thought but as much as I hate it myself, we both 
have school.&quot; I sighed, not wanting to leave the bed so soon. Here I 
was alright, protected from the horrors of the outside world. Minako 
had not spoken a word about me suddenly showing up on her doorstep 
after the first couple of times and I was forever grateful for that. 
Maybe this time I would try and find out to see how long I could stay 
before they tried getting me back. So, I was useless to them now for 
what reason ever? Fine. Then they should leave me alone. I wouldn&#39;t 
let the family issue destroy my quality time with Minako.
	&quot;Okay&quot;, I said reluctantly. &quot;Not that I got anything to learn 
there anyway. Private school or not.&quot; I was way ahead of the actual 
material and even designing one&#39;s own schedule didn&#39;t help that much. 
I think I could easily skip at least a year, maybe two in a normal 
school. Besides Mugen was becoming more and more unbearable to me 
since I allowed myself to depend more on my spiritual senses. 
Something was going on there and it made me sick. Not the physical 
sickness I had endured for almost six years of my life but a mental 
sickness, bound to cause headaches and other symptoms after awhile. 
That was why I planned transferring to Juuban High at the end of the 
year. Okay, maybe it was because of Minako as well...
	Minako sat up and proceeded to put on some clothes. I think 
she was purposefully doing it in a way where I couldn&#39;t help but 
admire her perfect body. &quot;Well. Are you free this afternoon then?&quot; I 
laughed and tried hard not to let it sound bitter. &quot;You mean me, the 
person who has no social life other than being your girlfriend?&quot; 
Minako frowned but then suddenly brightened up. &quot;That&#39;s about to 
change. You are going to meet my friends this afternoon.&quot;
	Oh goody... I must have been silent a little too long since 
Minako glanced back at me worriedly. &quot;Nervous? We can wait if you 
want but I thought...&quot;
	&quot;No, no. I want to. It&#39;s just... I don&#39;t know how...&quot; I 
babbled, trying to find the right words. Yes, I had wanted to meet 
Minako&#39;s friends and teammates. From everything she told me, I 
thought I knew them already. They were an important part of what 
Minako was and I didn&#39;t want to be let out on this. Minako was not 
one to care much about other people&#39;s opinions as long as she 
believed in what she was doing. But I could tell that those of her 
friends were important to her. As much as she might say otherwise, 
she was a little nervous about this. And I...
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. They&#39;ll cope. I warn you, there will 
probably be some shouting, screaming, ranting and all the other 
stuff. Rei will surely freak. But you should not take it personal. 
They are the most accepting and open people I have known short of 
you. I&#39;m sure you will get along well.&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
The screen blinked with several numbers and figures that to the 
normal observer would really make no sense. For one thing they would 
have to be at least on Mizuno Ami&#39;s intellectual level - which was in 
itself unlikely - and they would have to be able to read the script 
that had been lost to humanity for a very long time. Once it had been 
THE language that bond all of Sol together, now it was only a cryptic 
arrangement of indefinable characters. The Lunar Script was a dead 
language.
	Not so to me or my companion, the black cat perched next to 
me and just now heaving a tired sigh. &quot;Still nothing?&quot; Yes, of course 
I could read the script and I could somehow understand most of it but 
the computer research was Luna&#39;s role. I would never dare to intrude 
there, my skills lay more in the hunting, the field research.
	The black cat I had know for millennia now shook her 
head. &quot;Nothing at all. The reports I&#39;m getting in from Priapos&#39; 
contacts are infrequent and jumbled. They just don&#39;t make sense. It 
seems that none of them has even been able to see who is running that 
damn place.&quot; It was the old matter again, I noted. Enemy research was 
running slow... No, let me correct that. It was stagnating.
	There was no progress at all over the night. Minako&#39;s sister 
had found some remains of the former elf kin on Venus, safely 
prevented from the Fall in a sub-dimension. I should have known that 
Venus&#39; magical society wouldn&#39;t just totally cease to exist. A few of 
them had obviously infiltrated the enemies&#39; base but as of yet still 
had found nothing that was worth anything. It drove Luna mad, not 
knowing what we were up against. That, combined with the mocking 
location of the base was sending her into unpredictable temper 
tantrums all morning.
	&quot;Give it some time. They have to move very carefully, you 
know that.&quot; Luna sighed yet again but nodded defeated. &quot;I set up the 
sensors on the Tomoe-ke. Can we try it?&quot; My companion reached over 
and pressed a different button. The screen immediately changed and 
showed several perspectives of the Tomoe residence through very 
sensitive, camera pins that probably every government, secret or 
whatever organization would murder to get their hands on. There was 
nothing interesting to see outside and the inside was only sparsely 
covered. &quot;I didn&#39;t get in far,&quot; I said, frowning at the lack of ANY 
activity.
	Luna nodded and gave the screen a critical glance. &quot;This is 
abnormal. Didn&#39;t you say they kept someone to help in the household.&quot; 
I confirmed that, which only helped to make Luna more suspicious. She 
had caught onto the lack of activity as well. &quot;I think it was a good 
thing you suggested that. Something is wrong there.&quot; Remembering the 
few times I had been over with Minako, I shuddered. &quot;It&#39;s... eerie. 
You would have to feel it yourself but believe me when I say 
something unnatural is there. I am not surprised with Hotaru carrying 
a demon for awhile...&quot;
	The sharp look leveled at me let me gulp and I realized with 
dread that I had just slipped. Turning cautiously, I hardened my 
resolve. Minako was trusting me on that one. &quot;No, she hasn&#39;t done any 
harm and the thing - whatever it was - is gone. I can safely attest 
to that myself.&quot; This was about all I could and would say. Luna held 
my gaze for a few more moments when surrendered.
	&quot;She&#39;s staying with Venus now?&quot; Luna asked after watching the 
cameras for awhile with the same lack of progress when the other 
matter. I nodded. &quot;Yes. I know what you are thinking. Playing at two 
games at once is not an option, as much as I would like to pursue 
this myself. For now she should be safe.&quot;
	After another silent period of time, Luna finally gave up and 
switched of the screen. Turning around to face me I noticed with a 
deep frown that she looked tired. Not only exhausted but a little 
bit... older. &quot;Luna-chan?&quot; I asked quietly, using the informal suffix 
one of those few times ever. &quot;I...&quot; She trailed off and I gave her 
time to gather her senses. &quot;I just hate how much a fuss I made. I had 
no right to deny Minako the happiness. All of them deserve it and I 
made a pretty, damn fool of myself just for violating a rule, even 
accidentally. Sometimes I think I did this too long already and it 
became routine. I don&#39;t want all this to become routine, Artemis. 
Can&#39;t they ever have some peace? That is what Serenity wanted for 
them.&quot;
	I trotted over to her, wishing for nth-time that I could 
still morph as before, so I just settled for a friendly and 
supporting nuzzle. &quot;I know Luna and you are doing all you can. I am 
sorry too for not telling you more about Hotaru and that time. It&#39;s 
not that I don&#39;t trust you... I...&quot; Kuso, sometimes I really could 
stick my foot in my mouth. Luna just laughed faintly. It was a little 
bit bitter. &quot;It&#39;s alright, Artemis... Maybe I&#39;m just stressed. I 
just... I must have made a pretty bad impression on the girl and I 
don&#39;t want everyone to think about me as the bitchy boss. I&#39;m not...&quot; 
Silencing her ramble with one paw I shook my head forcefully. &quot;Don&#39;t. 
I know.&quot;
	We sat in silence for awhile longer, this time it was 
slightly more comfortable but still tense to a degree. &quot;Tell you 
what,&quot; I suddenly quipped, nearly making Luna leap to the 
ceiling. &quot;You really are overworked. Why don&#39;t we swing by Rei&#39;s 
school as you wanted to do and then we do something nice?&quot; The female 
cat eyed me skeptically but I could tell that the sudden smirk and 
indignant pose was a fa&ccedil;ade. &quot;Artemisian Regnold, are you asking
me 
to a date?&quot;
	I shrugged my shoulders. &quot;Depends on your definition of a 
date.&quot; After all we were cats... most of the time.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Ami)
I sweated profoundly at the seemingly hopeless situation. The 
battlefield was practically devastated, only a handful of pawns 
remaining on both sides. Yet there I only possessed one rook and a 
knight for offense, my opponent still had both his bishop. I had 
tried lulling him into a trap but should have known better. My 
opponent was not easily fooled.
	Reaching out with one hand I intended to make a move but 
frowned, hesitating as I believed to spot something I had overlooked 
before. Suppressing the smile trying to wade its way through to my 
lips, I moved my rook two spaces up, closing off an escape route that 
would soon be needed, and hit the pin on the time clock. My opponent 
stared for a moment at the board and you could actually see the gears 
working overtime in his head.
	Finally, after two minutes of thinking while his time 
continued to mercilessly run out, the young teenager ruffled his hair 
in frustration and sighed heavily. &quot;Seems you won again. I give.&quot; I 
stood, sticking out my hand and he followed, taking the offered 
hand. &quot;Thank you, Mizuno-san. No one rarely gives me a challenge 
anymore those days. I don&#39;t like to lose but I also don&#39;t mind if my 
opponent is better.&quot; Blushing faintly, I mumbled something along the 
line of: &quot;It was just luck.&quot; The teenage boy shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t 
believe so. You shouldn&#39;t sell yourself so low.&quot;
	&quot;I agree with your boyfriend there, Ami-chan,&quot; Makoto said as 
she strolled into the bedroom, whereto we had retreated for our game. 
I hadn&#39;t even heard her coming and the blunt comment of course didn&#39;t 
help much. &quot;He&#39;s not my boyfriend,&quot; I managed to say in a calm tone, 
barely. &quot;We just both share some interest and Edugawa-kun just 
happened to come by.&quot; Makoto had been out for a few hours and it was 
bare luck that I had met him downstairs, apparently he lived a floor 
below.&quot; The boy in question laughed. &quot;I&#39;ve seen you around 
sometimes... Kino-san, was it? I live in 128.&quot; Makoto blinked, 
obviously trying to remember encountering him in her time 
here. &quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m new to the area. Just been here around two 
months.&quot;
	Turning to me he made a dramatic show of bowing which looked 
so hilarious I barely could contain the laughter. &quot;It was nice 
playing with you, Mizuno-san. Maybe we can do this more often now 
that we are practically neighbors.&quot; I smiled at him. &quot;I would like 
that.&quot;
	After my chess partner for about a year now left, Makoto 
closed the door and gave me a look of mirth. &quot;Not your boyfriend, 
huh?&quot; I shook my head, having collected myself by now. &quot;No, he is 
not.&quot; Noticing her look I added with a soft smile. &quot;Interested?&quot; 
Makoto blushed. &quot;Don&#39;t bother yourself. I believe Conan-kun already 
has a girlfriend.&quot; To which the tall brunette swore. &quot;A pity.&quot; 
Raising an eyebrow, I asked: &quot;Didn&#39;t you say once that you don&#39;t like 
nerdy types?&quot; Snorting Makoto placed her shopping back finally down 
on the table. &quot;Yes. But I like intelligent types.&quot;
	Alright that was a good point. Edugawa Conan was certainly 
not bad-looking and I always thought he wore the glasses simply for 
style. His clothing was of good taste but not too overdone. He would 
have made a fine catch but as I told Makoto. He was already hooked. A 
little part of me pitied that as well.
	&quot;What is he doing to keep up with you in a game of chess?&quot; 
Makoto asked curiously after a short period of silence. Wondering if 
I should share this, I decided that out of all people I knew Makoto 
was not one to shout things around a classroom like, say, 
Usagi. &quot;He&#39;s a junior detective.&quot; My friend&#39;s eyes got wide at that 
and her mouth opened and closed several times. &quot;But he looks so 
young, he can&#39;t barely be more than... fourteen?&quot; I thought for a 
moment before answering. &quot;Almost fifteen, I think. We might have to 
be a little careful with him around while rushing out for Senshi 
business in the future. Conan-kun has a VERY sharp mind and even 
better observation qualities.&quot;
	Makoto nodded, her face growing serious at the mentioning of 
Senshi business. After yesterday&#39;s strain it had been quite a relieve 
when the school called in this morning. Apparently a lot of parents 
were worried because Juuban Junior High was close to the battle site 
from yesterday and feared a repeat of whatever had been going on. The 
school administration had given the students a free day which left 
Usagi, Makoto and me with an unexpected free morning that could have 
been spent on a much needed meeting. However, Rei and Minako were 
going to different schools and therefore didn&#39;t have our luck. Yes, 
for once I considered it luck because I was still tired from the 
effort of maintaining the barrier for Moon, Tuxedo Kamen and Venus 
yesterday.
	Waking up this morning, I had been a little disorientated 
until I remembered that I was living with Makoto now... Yesterday 
evening I had even tried walking back home until my friend had 
reminded me, to my embarrassment, of the new arrangement. I had spent 
some time thinking about it with the new - or was this old? - set of 
memories now present and had come to the conclusion that this 
arrangement would probably be beneficial in the future. There was no 
parent or roommate to look out for when a distress call came in.
	None of us was happy that we had to fight again but I tried 
not to think about it too much. That would lead to memories I wanted 
to better forget and none of them would help us at the moment. The 
mood had been somewhat strained when we parted ways yesterday. I 
think all of us had realized how severe the situation truly was. One 
or two Youma once in a couple of days was one thing, almost two dozen 
high class Youma at our first fight in over a year was another.
	&quot;Minako called in a meeting for this afternoon. We are all to 
meet at Crown Fruit Parlor.&quot; Good. I was puzzled though. &quot;Why there?&quot; 
I would have thought we would make a classic meeting at the Jinja. 
That was after all more secluded. &quot;Beats me,&quot; Makoto answered, none 
the wiser.

(Rei)
I was only half-listening to the teacher. That was not because the 
topic was boring or I had better things on my mind - I tried to not 
think of those other things for the moment. No, it was simply a lack 
of sleep and the resulting exhaustion that had settled into every 
muscle of my body. I did envy Makoto for her training since she 
obviously wasn&#39;t really winded from yesterday&#39;s strain and I was 
wondering what kind of &quot;recharge&quot; Minako had been getting to 
practically bounce back in no time from channeling colossal energies 
before winning a marathon run... It still made me suspicious, the way 
she had behaved yesterday, the mental shields as strong as I could 
only expect them from Grandfather. She had never shown such an 
ability before and I could not believe that someone could train this 
in less than half a year. No way.
	So, after finally getting home, I was ready to sleep for two 
days straight, yet thoughts about all that had transpired the day had 
kept me awake long into the night. Not to mention that I had awoken 
before dawn and wasn&#39;t able to sleep anymore. Taking a meditative 
session had not helped or brought sufficient results from the fire 
reading at all.
	Of course while the teachers could often do a remarkable job 
of ignoring an obviously tired student, that did not apply to the 
rest of the students. &quot;You don&#39;t look too good. Are you sure that you 
shouldn&#39;t be in bed?&quot; Hitomi asked. It had taken some time to find my 
friend, Naru and Umino later on but apparently they had all gotten 
away unharmed in the middle of the chaos breaking loose on the track 
course.
	I frowned slightly at my friend. I might be tired, however, I 
was not unaware of the glances being directed my way all morning as 
if the other girl was searching for some hidden secret. A not so 
pleasant thought sent my mind reeling for a moment. Had Hitome seen 
us change? Her and Usagi&#39;s friends had all been close by when we 
changed. They had practically stood next to us. Yet Naru and Umino 
had acted as if nothing had happened... Then again Hitome was a very 
intelligent and sensitive girl. I always had the impression she had 
more than gotten her own fair share of experience of the darker side 
of this world.
	&quot;I&#39;m alright,&quot; I finally answered after I noticed that my 
silence only increased her worry and that probing stare. &quot;Just didn&#39;t 
get much sleep.&quot; Quickly thinking, I added: &quot;Those things gave me 
some nightmares, I admit.&quot; Hitome nodded. &quot;Yeah, tell me about it. I 
was worried than we got... separated.&quot; Again there was an odd tone in 
her voice but it was immediately gone when she switched over to some 
petty small talk as the bell rang, signaling the end of the period.
	Excusing myself I went down the hallway and out into the 
open. Fresh October air assaulted my senses immediately and I briefed 
in the rich smell of the season of change. I chucked tiredly. Change, 
yes. A pretty big change. It would take some time to settle into the 
old routine of somehow merging normal life with that of a Senshi 
again. Unfortunately yesterday&#39;s action had proved that time was the 
one thing we probably would not have.
	I closed my eyes briefly as I leaned against the old cherry 
blossoms tree that stood almost as high as the school building and a 
vision briefly flared in front of my mind&#39;s eyes. Standing atop a 
hill of snow and ice with a wailing, scared and sad Sailormoon 
clinging to me. Being held high by the last DD Girl. The hot searing 
pain as the last cleansing flame my Fire Soul attack would ever give 
consumed me... I tried to block out the images but they kept coming, 
merciless, branded into my mind. Kami, I never EVER want to go 
through all this again. Demo... A smiling Usagi replaced the series 
of tormenting memories. I can&#39;t let you go through all this again as 
well, Odango Atama.
	A heavy sigh escaped from my lips. This wasn&#39;t fair. Not at 
all. I had a life. Ojiji was upping the drill of my training, school 
went into the final phase of Junior High School and even though I 
didn&#39;t need to take entry exams like the others, falling behind on 
the topics was something I didn&#39;t really desire. Now there was Senshi 
business too and that came with a full new load of problems. I hated 
to burden myself with all that worry, still, not only my duty as a 
Shinto miko but also my compassion for my friends did not help 
lessening the strain any. This was all happening so fast.
	&quot;Hello, Luna,&quot; I regarded the cat, perched in one of tree&#39;s 
many branches, concealed from normal view almost as good as a 
chameleon. It has to be mentioned to her credit that Luna did not 
fall out of the tree in surprise. &quot;I have trained a lot with Jiji 
lately. You have to do better than that to stay hidden from me.&quot;
	The black cat with the crescent moon on her forehead stepped 
into plain sight, slightly embarrassed. &quot;We are all going to meet at 
Crown Fruit Parlor this afternoon around three if this is fine with 
you,&quot; she came to the point without exchanging pleasantries. I 
considered it for a moment and then nodded. &quot;Why there though? 
Wouldn&#39;t it be safer to meet at the Jinja as usual?&quot; Luna grimaced 
briefly, an act that wasn&#39;t lost on me, before answering. &quot;That was 
what Makoto asked as well. Minako called in the meeting, so I imagine 
she has a reason...&quot; Usagi&#39;s advisor trailed off under my intense 
gaze that had settled on her. &quot;Nani?&quot;
	&quot;What is going on here, Luna? Yesterday Minako was... 
different.&quot; That was one of those problems that got me heavily 
worried. &quot;Yes, that thing with the Tear shocked me as well. There are 
a lot of things Artemis and Minako have refused to share with me 
after they came back from England during Summer break...&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t mean that,&quot; I pressed on. &quot;I tried to probe her mind 
briefly when we were on the astral plane. Luna, I have never seen 
such a sensitive reaction to a mind probe in my entire life. It was 
like burning my fingers in a pit of lava.&quot; I shuddered at remembering 
the experience. It was brief and gone before it really registered, 
however, the warning had stuck.
	Whether or not, she didn&#39;t really know or didn&#39;t want to 
tell, the only thing Luna gave in reply was: &quot;I suppose you find out 
later. Try not to be as judgmental as I have been though.&quot; And with 
that ominous statement hanging in the air she hoped away before I 
could stop her.
	&quot;What the hell was that all about?&quot; I muttered, shaking my 
head. Making my way back, with even more questions spinning around in 
my mind, I nearly didn&#39;t see Hitome standing in the doorway. &quot;There 
you are! Did you forget that you had a appointment with that agent in 
fifteen minutes?&quot;
	Kuso! I hate my life... Groaning, I slumped against the wall, 
wanting nothing more than to sleep for the next week or so. My life 
was getting much too complicated all of a sudden.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Makoto)
The path of a true martial artist is wrought with peril... Sensei 
would cringe at the hackneyed quote from his old man. Yet, in essence 
it was the truth. For him, my sensei, myself, every martial artist in 
the world. And it was that bland and yet simple quote that made me 
take this new change in stride. &quot;Do never bend your will to fate, 
instead see it as a challenge&quot; was my Sensei&#39;s modified version these 
days.
	There really wasn&#39;t much to do about it. I had learned a lot 
of control over the past year, more than I ever thought I could 
manage. The new situation was just a change, a change like it occurs 
every then and when. Lately I had searched for this new challenge 
life and fate presented me with now, I had felt that there was more 
for me to do, an important task. Now I felt a wonderful clarity. I 
knew again, I knew what I had been born for.
	I stepped into the lukewarm sun of mid-autumn, away from the 
cover the shadows of the trees provided. The other... woman stood 
casually leaned against a railing in this deserted area of a small 
park, not far from my apartment. Her features were definitely 
striking. The red, flaming hair, the lithe body, steeled through 
battle and formed into a deadly weapon. I could take all this in with 
a look and in turn felt her own eyes studying me. The wings from 
yesterday were gone and my enhanced senses could pick up the glamour 
on the pointed ears, suggesting to everyone not knowing about their 
true nature that there was nothing wrong about them.
	&quot;You scared Ami,&quot; I stated. The challenge letter had been 
brought to me by instant air mail. Well-aimed and with no danger of 
injuring anyone and yet it had made my new roommate jump. There was 
not much written. Just a &quot;Meet me in twenty minutes&quot;. Our auras had 
drawn us too each other, making further words unnecessary. The elf 
truly looked apologetic for a moment. &quot;I did not intend to. Still, if 
that is the state of your training, I am surprised you&#39;re still 
alive.&quot;
	I narrowed my eyes at the otherworldly creature named 
Priapos. &quot;And you are better than that, of course.&quot; Granted, none of 
then were at my level - or Venus&#39; for that matter. But I had not seen 
her fight much either, which was due to the fact that the elf had 
first dropped in at the conclusion of the fight. I owed her my life, 
that much was clear, still that didn&#39;t mean that I would shrink back 
from a challenge. &quot;Yes, I am,&quot; Priapos answered with a voice that 
didn&#39;t betray any form of overconfidence or scorn. &quot;However, I do 
believe that you have more to show than your comrades. Do you accept 
my challenge?&quot;
	Used to taunting during a sparing session from my Sensei I 
was slightly taken aback by the formality but quickly gathered my 
resolve. This was a test. I had the feelings that the elf would soon 
be a frequent part of not only the team but especially our training 
program. She wanted to judge for herself how good anyone of us 
was. &quot;Don&#39;t you usually take the best for last?&quot; I quipped, hoping to 
draw a response out of her. Again that proofed futile when Priapos 
refused to take the bait. &quot;I do. My sister and I usually spar in the 
evening.&quot; I didn&#39;t like the implications, yet had to admit that what 
Venus had shown yesterday was hard to copy, even for me.
	&quot;We will see. Bring it on,&quot; I replied and dropped into a 
loose fighting stance. Priapos did not move for a few seconds, 
however, before raising one hand and drawing a strange symbol in 
midair. &quot;Indeed we will.&quot; And with that the world flared briefly 
before I found my eyes adjusting again to a beautiful scenario in the 
middle of a mountain range. Down below you could see a river crawl 
through the fertile land, a small, medieval village was on its shore. 
The mountain air was pure and filled with the clear smell that helped 
washing away all your sorrow and worries for the moment. All in all 
the perfect battleground. Vacant, remote and undisturbed.
	&quot;Impressive,&quot; I noted and without a further word rushed 
forward. I wasn&#39;t foolish enough to underestimate the elf. If she 
really was frequently training with Venus - and I didn&#39;t see a reason 
why she should lie about that -, holding back could result in severe 
consequence in battle, at least a lot of hurt pride while sparring. 
Priapos met my first probing, cautious attacks equally. What would 
have been already a cosmic battle to the normal observer was only a 
warm up for us. That initial phase was left behind quicker than usual 
though and soon I lost myself in the heat of the incredible dance 
that was a good fight.
	Our bodies not more than blurs for the majority of the spar, 
I implied speed the human eye would deem impossible, surprisingly the 
elf matched every blow and I doubted that even in Senshi form it 
would have been enough. I did not dare to change though. Priapos 
wasn&#39;t using any magic as much as I could tell, it was an equal 
battle in Martial Arts. And I loved it.
	I didn&#39;t have such a good all-out fight in ages and with my 
level of training there was hardly anyone in THIS part of Tokyo who 
could provide me with a decent spar. Apparently this was about to 
change.

(Minako)
The schoolyard was surprisingly tidy and free of the usual bustle of 
students filling out from the classes, rushing around or preparing to 
go home. Instead the train of people from all ages, kid to adult was 
a steady but almost clinical arrangement. There were no running 
children, no teenage girls bickering loudly over the latest rumor. 
Conversations were - if even present - quiet and barely reached 
anyone else&#39;s ears. The whole thing was simply put... eerie.
	I had experienced private schools firsthand. Before we had 
moved to Tokyo I had had my own fair share of them but this was... 
Unnatural. Students and teachers alike seemed to almost behave like 
robots, their daily schedule planned for them down to the last 
microsecond. I believed that the studying atmosphere must be perfect 
but I asked myself where the compensation was in all this. Alright, I 
wasn&#39;t Ami but I believed... knew that even she needed to relax once 
in awhile.
	Of course the general coldness and the unsettling aura the 
whole place emitted didn&#39;t really surprise me. I had sometimes come 
by when Hotaru had classes late into the afternoon. There wasn&#39;t 
really that much activity then. The lack of a higher level now was 
serving my opinion about this place and that I could more than 
understand and support that Hotaru wanted out of here. With all her 
problems back then, it had been an ideal place to hide in the masses. 
Quietness was to be expected, intellect wasn&#39;t frowned upon. But 
social life? Contacts? Barely any comparison to any other school. 
That she wouldn&#39;t find here.
	I stopped at a corner, hearing muffled voices.  Bits of &quot;... 
heard you ran away again...&quot; or &quot;... is it true that you&#39;ll be going 
to a different school next year?&quot; reached me and I could tell they 
were directed at my mate. I could sense Hotaru just around the corner 
and the echoes I received from the bond were varying from trepidation 
to annoyance.
	&quot;This is none of your business. Would you excuse me now, I 
have somewhere else to be.&quot; Tell them, Raven. I smiled to myself. 
Hotaru had become more and more confident in herself over the last 
months since the cleansing and it showed that she was really willing 
to do something for her new life. Still, a lot of this was a false 
front of bravery that was mostly there to put me at ease. As if she 
ever could hope to hide something from me. There was actual progress 
there, it was, however, slow and very fragile.
	&quot;Not so quickly, witch. You know we don&#39;t like people who are 
against the school and neither do students just leave. We are all 
part of a big community, have you forgotten the words of your own old 
man.&quot; Alright, I decided. Enough was enough. Introducing Hotaru to 
the group would be enough stress already. I was sure that she had 
wrecked her pretty little head all morning how to make a good first 
impression. Hotaru was a person who wanted to please everyone, it was 
deeply rooted in her nature and of course very much due to her 
upbringing.
	Rounding the corner I leveled a calming smile at my nervous 
girlfriend and she instantly relaxed. I made an impressive show, 
stalking up to one of the older boys and picking him up at the rim of 
his shirt. &quot;Is this a way to treat a fellow student? Is this in your 
school arrangements? I believe not. Now if you would be so kind to 
let the lady here pass?&quot; The boy&#39;s struggles were fruitless against 
my strength that not only was Senshi-benefited but also finely honed 
over the last month through frequent training periods with my kin 
sister.
	&quot;What&#39;s your problem, tramp? You don&#39;t belong to this school 
and this is private territory. So I&#39;d advise you to leave...&quot; I 
squeezed a little at the nape of his neck. So, he felt like being the 
confident one? Fine with me. He could have his ego crushed, not my 
problem. Hotaru by now had quietly slipped around the rest of the 
boys who were watching in unbelieving fascination. &quot;What did you call 
me?&quot; The still struggling boy made some gurgling noises and I 
released the hold on him a little. &quot;Well?&quot; I said quietly but loud 
enough for his friends to hear while turning him around and leaning 
close to his face. An expression of fear rushed over the boy&#39;s face 
and he stuttered out his answer quickly. &quot;No-Nothing at all, Miss.&quot;
	I nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; With a thud and maybe a little too much 
force than actual necessary I set him down, he immediately scrambled 
into the circle of his friends who were backing away now. &quot;Now you 
will listen and listen carefully. If I hear anyone and I mean ANYONE 
ever harassing my girlfriend ever again, then you will regret it. And 
if you think about threatening her, that is totally futile, I have my 
ways to find out.&quot; With a look I implied that those methods weren&#39;t 
actually pleasant even if I was merely referring to our link.
	Grabbing Hotaru&#39;s hand I turned to go. &quot;If you excuse us now. 
As Raven already said. We have somewhere else to be.&quot; Suddenly 
feeling bolt I leaned down for a brief kiss which for some reason 
turned more into those &quot;swept me off my feet&quot; ones. Hotaru visibly 
trembled when I was finished and lead her away from the thugs who 
were stunned into silence, gaping after us.
	Only then we were some distance away from Mugen Gakuen did 
Hotaru finally break her silence. She was still blushing madly 
though. &quot;I... I don&#39;t believe you! That was so...&quot; she paused briefly 
and I feared that I had overdone it, maybe completely wrecked her 
reputation. &quot;... absolutely cool!&quot; she finished with a smirk to my 
complete and utter surprise. Hotaru glanced back at the school and 
shook her head. &quot;I wish I had a camera.&quot;
	I blinked. She must really hate that school. No wonder that 
she wants out. A fresh start at a new school with all of us to 
support her... Hopefully with all of us to support her, I was sure 
Hotaru would do much better and find her own friends soon. Answering 
her smirk with one of my own, I put an arm around her shoulders to 
enforce my following statement. &quot;Nobody messes with my girl.&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
Okay... That went extremely well. Okaasan had chewed me out where I 
was last night. Despite calling and saying I&#39;d stay over with Makoto -
 knowing she would vouch for me without asking, I had the feeling 
that she looked right through it. A good thing that neither Shingo or 
Otousan were here or I would have never gotten upstairs. I needed a 
shower and some fresh clothes badly.
	We had forgotten the time this morning over breakfast, just 
talking. That had been relaxing and it helped diverting from all 
those other problems that came with the re-rediscovery of our love 
and the whole complicated situation. Therefore I had to jump into my 
clothes when I finally realized that I would be late for school since 
I had to come over and get my things. I was already well on my way 
when Mako called and let me know school was off for today...
	One good thing was that Okaasan hadn&#39;t inquired anything 
about the date. Thankfully. Otherwise I was sure that I would have 
let something slip. &quot;The Baka will really get me into trouble one 
day,&quot; I stated half-serious. It was worth it though. We could be 
together now, without any pressure, kingdoms or laws to worry about. 
Now if there just wasn&#39;t that new enemy again... I didn&#39;t want to 
lose Mamoru/Endymion anymore. That last time had been enough, I 
couldn&#39;t bear another time. He and my friends were the most precious 
thing in my life and seeing them all die... Kami, it had torn my 
heart right out there and then. Until this moment I still hadn&#39;t 
figured out how I could have pulled through until the end.
	As the hot water hit my body I immediately felt my muscles 
relax. Yes, sleeping on the couch with Mamoru had been pleasant and 
welcomed - even if honestly not planned - but the pleasant aspect 
didn&#39;t really apply to the crumbled position.  Additionally I had 
some problems with dreams haunting me throughout the night, one 
reason why I was up rather early for my usual standard. Surprisingly -
 or maybe even not so - the dreams had not been about me as much as 
they had been about Minako and that unfamiliar girl.
	What really got to me that every time I saw them my heart 
seemed to tear and leap with joy at the same time, overcome by such a 
strange familiarity that I almost thought I was one of them and 
Mamoru the other. Maybe it was an aftereffect from the channeling 
yesterday but I did not see how the other girl fitted into this. At 
one point I even had a totally embarrassing and quite farfetched 
dream of them doing... things. That had been the final straw that 
prevented me from sleeping again.
	The steady stream of water washed away most of the physical 
strain and exhaustion but my mind was still a blur, laced with worry 
about yesterday&#39;s attempts. I wanted to loath at Okaasan for 
unsealing our memories, however, otherwise we would all have been 
dead yesterday and Minako would probably have gone out all alone in a 
vain attempt to stop all of them, getting herself killed in the 
process. I wished I could have helped more. Everything I did was 
focusing the power stream, it had been my friend taking most of the 
risk. And that left me feeling unimportant, inadequate... Wasn&#39;t I 
supposed to protect them? Wasn&#39;t I supposed to be the one finishing 
off the Youma and save the day?
	It wasn&#39;t as much that I wanted that spotlight. I could very 
well do without any of it actually. But since I had not much choice 
in that matter I wanted at least to be able to help my friends. 
Seeing Venus and Jupiter&#39;s incredible fighting style yesterday and 
Mars still being able to at least hold her ground had put me off more 
than I allowed myself to think about. I knew I wasn&#39;t the physical 
strongest or skilled and as the Princess I assume that it was never 
meant for me to be a fighter at all. Still, I had done nothing other 
than watch and follow along with Minako&#39;s plan, focusing the power 
SHE provided with visible effort. My friend had nearly overdone it 
and that was just because I couldn&#39;t do anything. How good was a 
single tiara against a cascade of Youma anyway?
	Sighing heavily I tried to block out those unpleasant 
thoughts but failed yet again. Why did this all have to happen? And 
why so fast and so much at once? A complete insensitive baka could 
have sensed the tension in the air yesterday. The fact that we had 
all grown up over the years and were much more matured also pretty 
much meant that our lives had taken on a relative sense of order. A 
peaceful tranquility that had been rudely shattered and I feared that 
this could affect the relationship my friends and I had before the D-
Point fiasco. I feared that they didn&#39;t want to be Senshi anymore. 
And in the current situation this could be our downfall.
	The situation was grim. I was no fool to think that we had 
gotten off easy yesterday. This was an attack of a magnitude that 
Beryl had never launched on us since the last battle on the Moon. The 
worst we had to face were the DD Girls and that turned out so 
incredible well... Yes, we had won yesterday but if Minako hadn&#39;t had 
her ace... I didn&#39;t even want to follow that line of thought. Someone 
wanted us dead. US. Before that we had only always been a hassle to 
the Dark Kingdom&#39;s plans. Now there was no doubt that we had been the 
target.
	But above all... I feared that I didn&#39;t have the strength to 
be a Senshi again myself.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Luna)
I couldn&#39;t believe I broke down in front of Artemis. This was so 
embarrassing and certainly not a thing a lady should do. My training 
had screamed at me not to but I couldn&#39;t help it. All my life I had 
trained to be strong, a wise advisor, often even giving people 
orders. Artemis always had been so unlike me and it used to aggravate 
me to no end. For some strange reason he had been obsessed with me 
from the beginning. Not really in a bad, just an annoying fashion. In 
my youth he had often snug up to my quarters or dragged me away from 
my teachers. As much as I hated to admit it I had loved those short 
hours of freedom, of just being me.
	Maybe that was why I could not hold back. I really hated 
myself sometimes. For what I had become, what becoming an advisor had 
done to me. And more than once I wished that my family back on our 
home planet hadn&#39;t been royal. Artemis&#39; kin wasn&#39;t poor either but he 
did not have to deal with obligations. He had always cherished the 
freedom I just could not entertain. I had sworn myself that after I 
became an official advisor I would do it totally different. I would 
give them a certain space and all those things I had always yearned 
for. What a grand progress I had made from the freshling that had 
been sent to the Moon with all the multitude of hopes of the young to 
the cat stranded on Earth with fragmental memories of her old life 
trying to save a bunch of kids from themselves.
	Sometimes I really believed I failed them. I had not been 
able to prevent their fate from catching up to them, I had not been 
able to hold true to my charge&#39;s wish. In fact I had not been able to 
give them the freedom I had always wanted and swore myself to pass 
onto my students. It was a conflict that would leave me always 
guilty. Which way I decided to take, it would always have 
consequences that seemed to high for the outcome. I had tried the way 
of the heart and failed. Now I only had the way left that had been 
taught to me. Prepare them for what is to come. Even if they hate you 
for it, your own feelings don&#39;t matter, only their survival. I hated 
it, I hated me for it. But I didn&#39;t want to see them die again. Not 
one more time.
	&quot;Hey, beautiful. Didn&#39;t I say I want none of that solemn 
attitude?&quot; Artemis plopped down beside me on the low roof on of the 
building along the main shopping street of Azabu-Juuban. Our date so 
far had consisted of doing totally crazy things like in our youth. 
Running through deserted alleyways, Artemis snagging a bite from a 
kitchen and then running away from infuriated chefs... This sort of 
thing. It had felt good and been good for my psyche but now, 
apparently, it had gotten me thinking.
	&quot;Just thinking about the old times... It had been so simple 
then.&quot; My companion sobered instantly, his look faraway now. &quot;Yeah. 
Young and free, wild and full of dreams,&quot; he mused, shaking his head 
in quiet amusement. &quot;We were pretty na&iuml;ve,&quot; I added but instantly 
regretted it. Did I really forget how to have a good time without 
constantly worrying about the next social event or like now the next 
move of an unknown enemy?
	Surprisingly Artemis just looked at me for a moment, his eyes 
showing a hidden sadness but also a little guilt. Guilt? &quot;No, not 
na&iuml;ve, Luna. Just free of expectations and rules.&quot; After a short 
while he added: &quot;Never think the girls don&#39;t appreciate what you do 
for them. Without you they wouldn&#39;t have even reached Beryl and all 
of Earth would now be Metallia&#39;s territory. They would be lost 
without you, you know that. And that new enemy is not your fault.&quot;
	His forwardness and serious expression took me a little off 
guard and once again I was reminded why despite everything I trusted 
the baka. Why I knew I could tell him everything or maybe just needed 
to look at him and he would know. We knew each other so well. Grown 
up together, there never had been many secrets before. Maybe that was 
why I had reacted so badly to Hotaru and the whole situation at 
first. They were holding secrets from me, okay. I could live with 
that. But Artemis was holding secrets from me too. And that was 
something I didn&#39;t encounter often. I knew with absolute certainty 
that if it was essential for the current situation he would share 
this with me, I could tell it was eating him from the inside, and 
still I could not help but feel a little left out...
	Stop that now or you&#39;re going to end up in a mental hospital 
for cats... No wait, they didn&#39;t have them here. This time&#39;s methods 
were a little bit more... barbaric. And we wouldn&#39;t want that, 
right? &quot;Arigato, Artemis.&quot; I smiled at him softly, noticing his gaze 
now more gently resting on me. I was glad that he was here. I didn&#39;t 
think I would have been sane enough after a couple of weeks to guide 
the whole group. Mother and father probably wouldn&#39;t approve but the 
baka was worth something after all. And above all he was a good and 
loyal friend. I trusted him. He would tell me when the time was right.
	&quot;No problem. That&#39;s what I&#39;m here for.&quot; His goofy smile was 
often annoying and kind of macho-like now it was simply infectious. I 
grinned back at him. &quot;You really believe yourself to be the answer of 
every girl&#39;s problems are you?&quot; The smirk still firmly in place, 
Artemis&#39; eyes twinkled mischievously. &quot;Well,&quot; he drawled out the 
word, &quot;I recall a certain young lady once asking me about some VERY 
private...&quot;
	&quot;Artemis!&quot; I shrieked and lunged at him in mock anger, to 
some degree mocking at least. The white cat had anticipated the move 
and was already on top of the adjoining building, winking at me. I 
glared and my eyes narrowed. &quot;Oh. You will regret this,&quot; I mumbled 
and jumped after him. The chase was on.

Crown Fruit Parlor around this time was a busy place. Almost all 
booths were filled and if you didn&#39;t have your own one reserved it 
was a pain to get one for a whole group of people. Thankfully I knew 
the owner&#39;s daughter, so actually reserving one in advance wasn&#39;t a 
problem. We had deliberately chosen to be late for the meeting 
although I had called it in. This would have to go smoothly. The 
tension in the group was already evident. I didn&#39;t really fear the 
others&#39; reactions, there would have to be some serious mistrust that 
it would affect our relationship. I did, however, value my friends&#39; 
opinions. Very much.
	Stepping into the caf&eacute;, I squeezed Hotaru&#39;s hand and guided 
us through the masses of people to a table in the far corner. As 
expected they were already there. All of them, even Usagi. I made 
brief eye contact with Artemis to gauge the general mood. Upon simply 
receiving a curt nod I frowned but continued onwards anyway. It was 
to no surprise that Rei spotted us first and as her eyes narrowed I 
could feel a small tingle of doubt flash through the bond. Geez, Rei, 
you have to get over that attitude or you might really make yourself 
an enemy that you can&#39;t deal with one day.
	Hardening my resolve I lead Hotaru, who had retreated into 
shy and nervous mode, the last meters to the table. &quot;Hey, minna. 
Gomen, I know I&#39;m late.&quot; I made a hand gesture for Usagi to make a 
little space for me and Hotaru which she promptly did... by almost 
moving on Mamoru&#39;s lap, much to his embarrassment. None of the 
other&#39;s paid that much mind though.
	&quot;Um, Minako. I thought we were here to discuss... those other 
private things,&quot; Ami said, her voice dropping to a near-whisper with 
a curious glance at Hotaru. Makoto just raised an eyebrow but Rei all 
but glared at both of us. Usagi on the other hand was staring in... 
shock? Surprise? Recognition? Shimata, the bonding yesterday, she 
must have gotten glimpses from me and Raven. As Usagi finally noticed 
my gaze on her, she seemed to snap out of her trance. &quot;Now, now. Is 
this a way to make a first impression on Mina-chan&#39;s friend here. 
Please sit down, um...&quot;
	I chuckled, faking nervousness. &quot;Oh, gomen. Minna-san, this 
is Tomoe Hotaru and don&#39;t worry she knows about...&quot; I gave them a 
tale telling look. &quot;... those things.&quot; The reactions on this 
revelations of course were more or less unanimous here. It was just 
Rei who expressed everyone&#39;s shock in a dramatic show of nearly 
knocking the table over while jumping up and glaring daggers at me... 
us. &quot;NANI? Minako how could you? From you I had expected a little 
more...&quot; Man, she was pissed today. Obviously her school day hadn&#39;t 
been as uneventful as mine. I would have to be a little bit more 
careful with the actual revelation than expected.
	Fortunately someone decided to interrupt just then, clearing 
her throat. &quot;Onegai, don&#39;t raise your voice in here, the other 
customers want to eat in peace. If it can&#39;t wait, please take this 
argument outside.&quot; I glanced up at the brunette with the extravagant 
hairstyle and smiled pleasantly. &quot;No need for that, Unazuki-san. Just 
a little misunderstanding. Right, Rei-chan.&quot; I directed a look at the 
hot-tempered miko that clearly stated that she&#39;d better let me 
explain before jumping to conclusions next time. The raven-haired 
girl glowered at me for a moment, then just bowed apologetic to 
Unazuki and sat down with a huff.
	Motoki&#39;s little sister - though I doubted anyone even knew 
that - asked if my friend&#39;s wanted another drink and finally turning 
to us she asked with a smirk. &quot;The usual for you and your 
girlfriend?&quot; I groaned, wondering there the subtle approach I had all 
planned out beforehand had suddenly went off to. Hotaru confirmed the 
order since I was to busy fending off questionings glares. Rei 
grumbled something under her breath while Usagi nearly choked on her 
drink. Artemis just sighed and Luna shook her head.
	Against any expectations an uncomfortable silence suddenly 
settled over the table. I could feel Hotaru shift next to me and 
unconsciously wrapped an arm around her shoulders, which of course 
only managed to further drew attention to us. While most of it was 
curiosity and disbelief, the most animosity came from Rei. It wasn&#39;t 
anger as before but a deep suspicion, trying to literally burn away 
all our shields and see what this really was about. With not so much 
as a thought I tightened my mental defenses.
	After a small eternity it was Makoto of all people with the 
most unexpected of reactions. While I knew in advance that she was 
the last who would fall for prejudices, I didn&#39;t quite anticipate 
that sort of reaction. Leaning over from her position between Ami and 
Rei I was unprepared when she suddenly patted me on the shoulder with 
a smirk and a mischievous twinkle in her eyes. Bursting out into a 
sudden bellow of laughter, the tall brunette exclaimed: &quot;Now I 
expected a lot today but even though your sister dropped some hints, 
I must say... Mina-chan, who would have thought you changing teams! 
You of all people!&quot; Turning to Hotaru she plastered one of her 
brightest smiles on her face. &quot;You must really be special to her, 
Hotaru-chan was it, yes? I didn&#39;t think anyone could get one of us 
away from chasing boys.&quot;
	I was still dazed from the strange reaction from Makoto but 
looking around I could see that I wasn&#39;t the only one present who was 
taken aback by our friend&#39;s open acceptance. Whatever training Makoto 
had received, her teacher must have been a good moral influence as 
well. I didn&#39;t quite realize that that particular statement would get 
me some odd looks from people I didn&#39;t know...
	Ami was trying not to blush and looked down on the table, Rei 
was obviously torn between gaping in disbelief at Makoto and 
glowering at us, Mamoru looked... thoughtful as if he was trying to 
figure something out and Usagi... Usagi was smiling softly at us. 
While this in itself was expected I knew there was more behind that 
from that first time my Princess had laid eyes on Hotaru she had 
known... something. I didn&#39;t know how much but I made a mental note 
to question her later about it.
	Apropos questioning, seeing that Rei was once again in the 
mood for just that, I heaved an exaggerated sigh and prepared to 
launch into our tale. As much as we wanted everyone to know at least.

(Rei)
This was just great. How could someone be so impossible careless? And 
Minako no less. Back when we fought the Dark Kingdom I had to 
constantly be careful around the Jinja, so that neither Jiji or 
Yuuichiro noticed anything. We had often met there and I had not once 
let anything slip. Anything safe the incident with the Shadow had 
never come close to reveal our secret. And Minako just went, got 
herself a girlfriend - a GIRLFRIEND - and told her all about us. She 
was supposed to be our leader, the most responsible one. How could 
she endanger the life of all of us so easily. I...
	My mental rant was brought to a halt when Makoto suddenly 
perked up and actually tried to make fun of the whole situation. What 
was wrong with that girl? And the girlfriend issue is not THAT 
important as the other one, couldn&#39;t she see this? Or did she just 
want to ignore it? My nerves were already quite strained from the 
morning events and that just the last straw. I looked around, trying 
to gauge the reactions of the others. Ami seemed rather neutral while 
Usagi almost seemed as if she had already known. A fact that made me 
even more edgy. I might act often that I stood above things but it 
DID interest me what was going on. Yet, judging from her more curious 
expression, I believed that it might not have been more than an 
assumption or an aftereffect of yesterday&#39;s channeling. Mamoru seemed 
to be thoughtful as well but not really surprised either.
	I shifted my attention back to the duo. Minako seemed only 
the slightest bit nervous though that could only be a very good front 
for the dark-haired girl that was shifting uneasily where she was 
sitting next to the blonde. This was a development I had not quite 
expected. Even with Luna&#39;s ominous warning. A girl. Another girl of 
all the things. I was not the type of person to be judgmental about 
such things as preferences but believed that Minako had no idea what 
she was setting herself up for. This could very likely and very 
quickly end in heartbreak, a lot of tears and much disappointment. 
What she might have thought was something exciting and exquisite 
could very well turn into a nightmare. While I would never dare to 
make the choices in preferences for her, I knew what society could do 
to you. More than anyone present here could guess.
	I was about to say something, then Minako took up the 
explanation herself. I listened carefully trying to find anything 
suspicious in her tale while I watched the two closely. Despite her 
current nervousness Tomoe Hotaru was not an ordinary girl. I was 
almost a hundred percent certain that the spiritual cord I had felt 
from Minako yesterday was hers. No one should be able to achieve such 
a heighten state of bonding so quickly. At least no ordinary human 
with a Senshi.
	&quot;We met the first time about four months ago.&quot; Minako paused 
momentarily to look at Hotaru with a fond smile. &quot;I had just been 
dumped by my latest boyfriend. That had lasted longer than usual and 
I really had thought Hiroshi and I would work...&quot; She trailed off and 
before I could bite back the remark it had already slipped from my 
lips. &quot;Let me guess, you told him what you really were and he ran?&quot; 
Minako narrowed her eyes at me but it was surprisingly Usagi who 
interjected: &quot;That is quite enough, Rei. Would you let her explain, 
yes?&quot; For a brief moment I wanted to retort as I often did; this was 
not like our usual squabbles though. One look at my Princess told me 
that this hadn&#39;t been a request but an order. With a huff I sat back.
	&quot;No, Rei. If you would like to think rationally for a moment. 
I hadn&#39;t even been awake then. That was solely Hotaru&#39;s doing.&quot; 
Alright, I did feel a little dumb for that remark but... NANI? 
Everyone&#39;s attention was briefly drawn to the shy girl next to Minako 
at that last comment. &quot;Hotaru is to a degree spiritual gifted. 
She...&quot; Minako paused and I could practically HEAR her mentally 
communicating with her girlfriend. It wasn&#39;t telepathy that much I 
could tell, more like a series of emotions. It was Hotaru who decided 
to give the answer personally. The first thing she actually said 
since sitting down.
	&quot;I have a latent gift in healing. I believe I have it from my 
mother. When I met Minako this evening I was surprised that someone 
could be even more miserable than I was at this time. I... am not 
really popular at school to say it nicely and up to this time I was 
really sick too.&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice was soft and you had to strain to 
hear it. It had a faraway touch, yet there was no actual hesitation 
in it. &quot;I wanted to help her, for some reason I knew that I needed to 
help her. What exactly I did I was not sure but somehow I think I 
healed her soul.&quot;
	Healing one&#39;s soul? That was impossible. Maybe she lessened 
her pain but did not heal her soul. I doubted it was meant literal 
but what... Oh! Great. Hotaru apparently DID heal her soul indeed. 
This is just a matter of how you look at it. You didn&#39;t have to be a 
genius to figure out that she accidentally broke Usagi&#39;s memory seal 
and in the state Minako must have been after a breakup that, in a 
way, must have given her some salvation.
	Looking closer at the girl and cautious of the bond trying to 
probe deeper beneath the surface, I could tell that what Minako said 
was true. Hotaru did have some kind of spiritual power, even coming 
close to my own ability. There was something else though but it was 
hidden and protected. Trained eyes spotted the pendant around the 
girl&#39;s neck which only helped to further fuel my suspicion.
	I wonder if you really know her as well as you possibly think 
you do, I thought silently to myself. This Hotaru was a secret to me, 
I could not find anything that actually confirmed any suspicion. No, 
then you looked at her you could only find neutrality. And that was 
the same thing you found when you looked at the spirit of a Senshi.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Makoto)
I listened curiously at the story of the two. To say I was less 
shocked than the others that Minako apparently had shared her and our 
secret with the raven-haired girl would be lying. Instead of really 
be furious, like Rei obviously was at the moment, I was more 
interested in what a person this Hotaru had to be like to invoke so 
much trust in my friend. Minako usually was one to NOT take Senshi 
business lightly.
	&quot;Did she find out about you being Venus then,&quot; Rei asked, 
phrasing her question carefully, a bit to carefully for my taste and 
completely ignoring Hotaru. I could tell that Rei was stressed but 
this really was not a way to treat the poor girl. Believe me I 
recognize a social outcast when I see one. And this one had to go 
through a lot more if my instinct didn&#39;t betray me now.
	&quot;Iie,&quot; Minako answered calmly, sharing a look with 
Hotaru. &quot;That was more or less the funny thing. I had hid the moment 
the memories came back. Ironically we met a week later in England 
again. I saved her from a Youma and she somehow saw through the guise 
and glamour.&quot; Rei narrowed her eyes and I blinked. As much as I knew 
that wasn&#39;t possible. Though... I had not thought it possible to read 
chi patterns and manifest them until recently either.
	&quot;We haven&#39;t figured out how,&quot; Hotaru continued, &quot;maybe it was 
my close contact with Aino-chan&#39;s spirit and soul.&quot; I raised an 
eyebrow at the nickname and Minako, catching on to my amusement, 
blushed slightly. &quot;Anyway,&quot; the blonde quickly continued. &quot;To our 
surprise that we would not only be staying in the same town but 
apparently were sharing the same house...&quot; THAT made even me 
suspicious. A bit too many coincidence here, right?
	Minako looked around and shrugged. &quot;Yeah, I know what you are 
thinking. We have no clue either. I would bet though,&quot; Minako 
directed a stare at Usagi who was unusually quiet about all of 
this, &quot;that your mother had something to do with this. It was just 
too coincidentally.&quot; Usagi gave a slight nod but otherwise stayed 
silent. I could have sworn there had been some sort of silent 
conversation between the two but could not imagine what it was about. 
Had our Princess known in advance?
	Facing the rest again the two finished their explanation. It 
had gone pretty much by itself. They had encountered a few more Youma 
and discovered that there was some sort of mystical connection 
between them that allowed them to share energy first through... ah, 
physical contact and recently more and more spiritual as well. The 
growing connection quickly influenced their feelings and it didn&#39;t 
take long for them to acknowledge the growing love between them. It 
was a meeting of kindred souls. A meeting of two people who better 
understood than anyone else what the other was going through. They 
did not say as much but you could read it between the lines, in the 
subtle gestures and touches, the exchanged looks. They shared about 
everything and in my eyes this was simply beautiful.
	Rei&#39;s suspicious stare though was growing sharper with every 
word and I could not deny that the tale about Hotaru&#39;s abduction by 
one of Sailor V&#39;s old enemies - as Minako put it - was rather short 
and only telling the most basic information. There was a lot more to 
it. Especially the rescue part troubled me. I had caught the shift in 
Minako&#39;s chi for a moment when she related HER victory and was 
fortunate enough to catch Artemis&#39; expression briefly changing. They 
were hiding something. Which of course was only further venom to fuel 
Rei&#39;s foul mood.
	Fortunate or not - depends on how you look at it - any 
further discussion and the actual planned strategy meeting was cut 
short rudely. My senses flared with the noise of a gong and so I was 
already in motion when Minako suddenly called out a warning, pulling 
Hotaru down. Ami and Rei were not directly in the line of fire and 
able to react quickly enough than the window suddenly shattered under 
a blazing blast of energy. Usagi and Mamoru weren&#39;t that lucky and it 
was a miracle they didn&#39;t lose their heads in the process.
	The dark-haired student grunted in pain as some of the glass 
splinters dug into his back and for a moment I saw a horrible dej&aacute;
vu 
moment play over Usagi&#39;s face as her boyfriend shielded her from the 
worst. We had all shared Usagi&#39;s last experiences and the fight with 
Beryl, so I could tell what she was thinking. But compared to magical 
blasts this wouldn&#39;t be lethal. We were made of sterner stuff and I 
knew the Prince was too. He had to be.
	I was up and in a fighting stance the moment the blast shot 
over us and the Fruit Parlor erupted into screaming. To my surprise 
it wasn&#39;t Minako but Rei who was first out of the window, cursing 
something along the lines of: &quot;Just what I need!&quot; or something like 
that. Our blonde leader emerged a second later, making sure that 
Hotaru was alright, while Usagi was still fretting over Mamoru who 
tried to reassure her that it wasn&#39;t that bad. Out in the street I 
spotted movement at the entrance of an alleyway that Rei was moving 
towards to. A moment later both the obvious Youma and the miko 
vanished from sight, followed by a pronounced flash of red, 
indicating that Sailormars had entered the scene.
	&quot;She could have waited for us. What&#39;s her problem today 
anyway?&quot; Minako asked, watching with a slowly rising and bubbling 
rage as Mars came sailing out of the alley, followed by another 
figure that I couldn&#39;t quite make out from my position. &quot;I think 
she&#39;s just stressed.&quot; Shooting a glance at Hotaru - who was taking 
that exceptionally well, considering we had all been nearly grilled 
by a sneak attack - I tried to smile reassuringly. &quot;She&#39;ll get over 
it. Rei is actually a sweet girl, I think you guys just caught her in 
a bad mood.&quot; Yeah, a REALLY foul mood that is. Mars was throwing 
everything she had at the Youma now who seemed to almost mock her 
with evading most of them, while the rest seemed to harmlessly bounce 
of it&#39;s skin/armor.
	&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we help her?&quot; I asked, fetching my henshin wand 
from my subspace pocket. Looking around we noticed that the Fruit 
Parlor had emptied itself rather quickly. And in the mass panic 
nobody seemed to have noticed we were still here. Even the younger 
girl who Minako had addressed as Unazuki seemed to be swapped away in 
the rush... Oh well. Better for us, I supposed.
	&quot;Right. Hotaru see if you can do something about Mamoru-san&#39;s 
wounds. Everyone else, let us go help Mars. I, for my part, am not 
pleased about being attacked so cowardly.&quot; I had to agree there. 
Hotaru moved over to inspect Mamoru&#39;s back while Usagi reluctantly 
joined Ami, Minako and me.
	&quot;VENUS STAR POWER...&quot;
	&quot;JUPITER STAR POWER...&quot;
	&quot;MERCURY STAR POWER...&quot;
	&quot;MOON CRYSTAL POWER...&quot;
	&quot;MAKE UP!&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Venus)
&quot;SUPREME THUNDER!&quot;
&quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot;
Only seconds after the combined lightning energy beam crashed into 
the Youma we were already on it, diverting its attention away from a 
dazed but still seething Mars. The creature was as unsuspecting as 
they can get. The skin a pale gray that in bright daylight should 
blend well with both light and shadowy places, pronounced limbs and 
all in all more human-like than a lot of the others we had 
encountered. It&#39;s head was bald but the face was covered by a lens 
that seemed pretty much mechanical.
	I had to cut my observation short when the Youma whirled 
around, surprisingly unimpressed by the double attack that had hit 
dead on. Dodging a swing, I received an attack in the side that sent 
me sprawling while Jupiter was momentarily left alone. A whizzing 
sound cut through the air and as I looked up I saw the Youma narrowly 
avoiding a direct hit by Moon&#39;s tiara, instead the disc just cut open 
a wound in the left shoulder before returning to its wielder.
	&quot;Trying to kill unsuspecting people is the way of a coward! 
We will not stand for you endangering the lives of so many innocent! 
Ai to seign no! Sailor-fuku bishoujo senshi Sailormoon! Tsuki ni 
kawatte, oshioki yo!&quot; Mars who had recovered slightly, commented 
dryly: &quot;I don&#39;t think it cares much if that attack was cowardly or 
not.&quot; I had to agree with her there. Yesterday&#39;s attack had already 
shown that this enemy seemed to be aware of the danger we presented 
and were hell-bent on getting us out of the way. The Youma regarded 
Moon for a moment and you could actually see the eye lens flashing 
with activity. Before any of us could really react the Youma thrust 
out his arm, palm outstretched and leveled a blinding energy beam at 
Moon.
	&quot;Princess!&quot; I cried out, watching with horror as the attack 
struck. At the last possible moment where was a flash of black and 
white, accompanied by an almost instantly disintegrated red rose, 
moments later two bodies went flying. I glanced over at the parlor 
and saw Hotaru worriedly watching the exchange with the cats beside 
her. Tuxedo Kamen seemed to have taken most of the blast but his cape 
obviously had provided him with enough protection to at least survive 
it. Moon was not really hurt, only dazed and slightly disorientated.
	I turned back to the Youma and narrowed my eyes. Before I 
could launch into an attack of my own, Mars had already beaten me to 
it. &quot;You pay for that! FIRE SOUL... BIRD!&quot; One of her ofudas absorbed 
a Fire Soul and transformed into a fiery phoenix. The Youma seemed to 
be puzzled for a moment but quickly adjusted to the incoming attack. 
My eyes opened wide as the Youma seemed to form a mirror-like shield 
and angled it so that...
	&quot;Ack! EVERYONE DOWN!&quot; Following my own advise I hit the 
ground as the fiery bird suddenly rushed over our heads, deflected by 
the mirror. This was not good. This thing seemed to be clever and had 
a defense to Mars&#39; attacks. Were it only Mars&#39; attacks. I doubted 
that somehow, thinking back on Jupiter&#39;s and my initial strike. Time 
to test that theory...
	With a hand signal I told Jupiter to stay put and jumped into 
the air. Curling my body into a ball I passed over the Youma and 
turned still in mid-flight. &quot;VENUS LOVE-ME CHAIN!&quot; Months of training 
had helped me to control the chain as if it was an extension of my 
arm and so I was able to wrapp it around the gray-skinned 
Youma. &quot;Now!&quot; I called out but Jupiter had already powered up for an 
attack. &quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot; A thin but concentrated disc of 
lightning left her hand like a torpedo. Mars followed with her own 
new attack. &quot;BURNING MANDALA!&quot; Fire and lightning struck the Youma.
	Landing on my feet I discarded the chain for a follow-up 
strike. However, I never came to it as a massive tremble suddenly 
rocked the earth beneath our feet and I was forced to jump clear 
again. Jupiter and Mars were caught by surprise though. A lightning 
bolt came out of the cloud of smoke our attacks had left and sent 
Mercury flying. Moon was still worriedly kneeling next to Tuxedo 
Kamen. I spared a brief glance in the direction of the parlor but saw 
that no damage was done.
	Cursing under my breath, I reached into my subspace pocket 
and drew the Venus Tear out. I had been reluctant to use it so soon 
again. Yesterday&#39;s effort was straining enough but it seemed I was 
the only one left standing at the moment. &quot;Alright, time to play it 
hard.&quot; The crystal teardrop flared brightly when its shape shifted 
and reformed in four blades arranged in a cross-like fashion.
	Let us see how you deal with that. The Youma by now had 
successfully shown that it seemed to have counters for all our 
attacks and those that it obviously didn&#39;t know it had adapted to 
fairly quickly. Maybe it was time for more physical contact now. 
Letting out a battle cry I called upon every reserve I could muster 
and moved in with a speed and agility that took the Youma aback for a 
moment. It recovered quickly though and formed a blade of its own by 
transforming the right arm, limb, whatever...
	Trying a few swings, I rolled under one more and kicked up my 
feet while still in motion. I whirled around and leveled the Tear at 
the Youma. &quot;CRESCENT BEAM!&quot; This time the Youma was not quick enough 
to adept to the power-charged attack and it carried him a short 
distance before, to my growing annoyance, it flipped around and 
landed back on its two feet, seemingly not winded at all. This was 
quickly becoming frustrating.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mercury)
My body protested with agonizing pain as I tried to push myself up. 
That attack had come so quickly I had barely registered it with my 
visor and the smoke had provided that extra moment for its success. I 
felt like I had ran headfirst into a live wire and my mind was fuzzy. 
Not a good situation for someone who relayed heavily on their 
intelligence.
	Venus had engaged the Youma in close combat now, wielding a 
strange energy weapon with four blazing blades of light arranged a 
small round object like a cross... I gasped slightly as I recognized 
it as the Venus Tear our blonde leader had used in yesterday&#39;s fight. 
Until now I had assumed that there were only superficial differences 
between the Tear and the Ginsishou. Now I realized how wrong I had 
been. The Tear was obviously much more a weapon than the Silver 
Crystal who always had been more a focus and an amplifier. Watching 
critically I noted that Venus&#39; attacks had doubled, maybe even 
tripled in power but it also took a lot of energy from the wielder. 
No safeguards. I frowned as my data showed that by now any regulation 
that might have been there should have kicked in. Venus was tiring 
quickly but continued to drain her reserves more and more.
	I have to find some weakness, there must be a weakness. 
Pulling out the Mercury Computer I began furiously typing, 
transferring the information from the fight and trying to find a 
weakness on its basis. The Youma seemed to be invulnerable to our 
elemental attacks. Even combined powers seemed to be of no greater 
use. But Moon had gotten a hit in. Why had Moon&#39;s Tiara hurt it, even 
if only slightly?
	Mars and Jupiter had regained footage again and were now 
trying to assist Venus which gave our leader time to fall back and 
gather her breath. For a moment I felt a pang of regret at just 
standing here. But the three had shown that in close combat Moon and 
I were years behind them and would only be in the way. They needed me 
to find a weakness.
	I looked over at Moon who watched the whole thing with a 
growing depression. She had to feel awful, I realized. Usually it had 
always been her who ultimately brought the victory. Her tiara had 
barely scratched it. And still it had penetrated the armor. Why? Was 
it that this attack was more light magic? No, Venus&#39; powers were 
similar and the best she managed was staggering the Youma. So why...? 
What if it is not our elements per se, just the attacks... But even 
the newer ones that we just developed had be quickly adapted to. So 
it couldn&#39;t be that. And Moon had her tiara attack since the 
beginning so...
	Since the beginning? I narrowed my eyes as Venus managed to 
slash through the Youma&#39;s skin. What were we dealing with here again? 
Dark Kingdom agents. With a possibility they could be totally 
unrelated to Beryl&#39;s group. They could have just risen. They would 
have no knowledge about the Senshi&#39;s activities in this time. 
However, they would have a recollection of what we were in the Silver 
Millennium.
	&quot;Aha!&quot; I shouted triumphantly. Now how to use that to our 
advantage? Snapping my computer shut, I quickly called up my 
power. &quot;SHABON SPRAY!&quot; Almost instantly a thick mist covered the 
area. Venus, Mars and Jupiter did not need to be specifically told 
that this was a good opportunity to regroup. A few moments later they 
were next to me.
	&quot;Found something?&quot; Venus asked, slightly out of 
breath. &quot;Maybe. Listen I believe this thing is filled with data of 
our powers but instead of our activities in this time, it&#39;s based on 
our Silver Millennium identities.&quot; Mars scrunched up her face. &quot;How 
can you be sure? And how would that help us?&quot; Jupiter and Venus also 
seemed skeptical. &quot;For once,&quot; I said, &quot;the Tear seems to hurt it and 
so did Moon&#39;s tiara. Both haven&#39;t been around when we were still 
living in the Moon Kingdom. There was no Sailormoon and the Venus 
Tear was a myth.&quot;
	Venus put a hand under her chin. &quot;Hmm. That seems logical. 
That means we have to do things that are different from what we were 
capable of in the Past.&quot; Leave it to Venus for battle strategies. 
Mars started to make a remark but Jupiter rather loudly smacked her 
fist in her palm. &quot;Alright. We all have benefited somewhat from 
individual training. Let&#39;s concentrate on that.&quot; For a moment Mars 
regarded the taller Senshi dubiously, then a slow, grim smile formed 
on her lips. &quot;Right.&quot;
	The mist by now had more or less cleared away. The three 
Senshi were just about to set their new battle plan into motion when 
the Youma suddenly was all over us. In my excitement over finding a 
possible strategy that could actually be working, I had totally 
forgotten that if the Youma and its equipment was meant to counteract 
our known strengths, it must have had a method to penetrate my fog... 
That realization came a little too late.
	&quot;Kuso!&quot; Jupiter mumbled and the next thing I knew I was 
pushed out of the way. Rolling with the fall the scream of my team- 
and new roommate, let me whirl around instantly. Jupiter had taken 
the blast that had been for me directly into the stomach and was now 
bent over, coughing violently. The Youma moved to follow through with 
the killing blow while Venus and Mars were unable to react quickly 
enough.
	Anger and desperation mixed inside of me at the sight of the 
tall brunette who had so willingly let me stay with her, forming a 
deep cold flame. &quot;SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!&quot; The gust of water caught the 
Youma, totally focused on the downed opponent totally off guard and 
managed to freeze the limb with the blade instantly.
	A rush of wind was the only thing that gave me a hint of the 
new arrival. You had to give it to the Youma. It was able to dodge 
the powerful, quick and yet accurate swing from the energy blade 
wielded by one angry elf. It lost it&#39;s arm though. Priapos had just 
joined the battle. &quot;Really, you guys need some serious training.&quot; 
Further comments were prevented as the Youma simply regenerated its 
lost limb. The elf shook her head. &quot;Great. It&#39;s one of those things. 
I thought they were extinct ever since the Silence took over Mercury.&quot;
	Mercury? I blinked. What does this have to do with my mother 
planet. Did they originate there? I couldn&#39;t remember and once more I 
cursed our lack of a proper recollection from our past. For some 
reason I felt like I SHOULD know the answer. There was this nagging 
feeling that the elf&#39;s comment was more important than intended. I 
just couldn&#39;t tell why.

(Moon)
I felt so helpless. Helpless and indecisive. Torn between tending to 
Tuxedo Kamen who had bravely taken a deadly blast that had been aimed 
at me and helping my Senshi. Even though I could tell Mamoru wasn&#39;t 
mortally wounded, I wondered what could I do to help my friends? That 
Mercury wasn&#39;t actively participating until now when the Youma had 
scattered their formation was understandable. She was not so much a 
fighter as she was a thinker. But I? I was Sailormoon, their 
Princess, their strongest, their FRIEND. So why was I sitting here, 
telling myself I just wanted to make sure my boyfriend was safe? 
Makoto had almost been killed there, hadn&#39;t it been for Mercury 
pulling out her new attack and Minako&#39;s elfin sister entering the 
battle...
	A tear slid down my cheek. Earlier I had asked myself if I 
had the heart to be a Senshi again. If I truly wanted all that 
responsibility and the sacrifices coming with it. This was no 
fairytale, no wondrous story about the hero and heroine saving the 
world and live happily ever after. This was reality. A reality in 
which our enemy had almost succeeded in driving a knife right into 
our unsuspecting back. And although we survived that attack, would we 
survive the following struggle. Last time my Senshi had died, in 
front of my eyes. Mamoru had given his life for mine and I had given 
mine for the world. If the Ginsishou hadn&#39;t fulfilled my last wish, 
that would have been the end of the Sailorsenshi.
	I watched with growing despair as the Youma tore through the 
unstable formation of my friends. Even Priapos wasn&#39;t able to engage 
it long. They were losing, unable to gain a moments rest to execute 
the plan they obviously had discussed. Mercury&#39;s scream tore through 
my heart as she was slammed into the wall of a nearby building and 
Jupiter&#39;s battle aura flared a sickly green for a moment as she 
attacked in a blinded rage which only earned her another trip to the 
pavement.
	I can&#39;t even do anything more than throwing my tiara. The 
Moon Staff is gone. I had tried to summon it but it seemed the old 
wand was either lost in the ruins of the Dark Kingdom at D-Point or 
in the time-loop I created myself. Either way I couldn&#39;t reach it. 
What would I give for something, anything as a weapon to help my 
friends with. They had died for me, protected me to the end. If it 
meant giving up my own happiness, if it meant being a Senshi again 
and going through all the hardships again, if it was this what it 
took to keep my friends safe and the world a happy place, then... 
then...
	Mars fireball was overcome by a jet of water smashing her 
next to Mercury into the same wall, Venus was panting hard, her 
motions becoming slower, less agile. Jupiter was slowly consumed by 
anger, frustration and rage that made her moves less accurate. And 
Priapos wasn&#39;t able to handle the Youma alone.
	I glanced down at Tuxedo Kamen as I felt his hand over 
mine. &quot;Go,&quot; he rasped, barely a whisper. I shook my head in an 
attempt of futile denial. What good would I be? What could I 
do? &quot;They need you, follow your heart and it will show you a way to 
help them.&quot; A comforting warmth spread through me. This hands, they 
had always given me strength. His words, simple touches, protective 
arms, even when I didn&#39;t know who he was, my Prince had always made 
me able to be the strong warrior, the friend of them all. I could 
feel it now, the tingle of magic, the barest traces of a power that 
he wasn&#39;t even aware of having himself.
	And suddenly that power literally exploded as another joined 
the contact between us. I looked up startled as I felt my senses 
overflowing with an unidentified, yet vast power. Hotaru was kneeling 
next to us, clasping Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s free hand and a gentle purple 
glow indicated that she was healing him as she did before. I could 
hear the shouts in the distance but they grew silent as my eyes 
locked with those of the other girl&#39;s and something passed through 
and between us. Glancing at Tuxedo Kamen whose mask had long come 
off, our eyes locked as well. In a brilliance that was blinding and 
magnificent at the same time a bright flash lit the air where our 
hands had been joined. The sphere of light took shape into a long 
wand with a red and golden head with a heart shape resting on its top.
	*This is your new Moon Staff, Princess. With the power of 
your loving heart, you can protect those that you care for. Use it!* 
Queen Serenity&#39;s voice echoed in my head. Reaching out with trembling 
hands I took the staff out of the air. The moment ended abruptly and 
I barely registered the last bit of a warning. Turning around slowly 
I saw that the Youma had reached us and was practically right in our 
face. For a very odd reason it did not move, seemed actually frozen 
in mid-motion.
	I had no time to comprehend this or maybe I would have 
noticed that Hotaru was staring at the Youma intently, her eyes blank 
and flashing purple. So, I simply shrieked a little and jumped back 
as a golden heart shape slammed into the Youma&#39;s back, sending it 
flying over our heads. Venus was panting, holding the Venus Tear 
still outstretched, traces of magic running over the blades. Mars and 
Jupiter immediately took advantage of the situation.
	Jupiter was merely a blur as she moved past us. With 
amazement I saw her forming a beautiful ball of purplish-red energy 
between her hands. &quot;KONGOU NO GIHEI!&quot; A beam of the same color leapt 
forth from her outstretched hands and slammed into the stunned Youma 
with the force of a truck running over an unsuspecting person. It 
lived though, barely. Mars followed her teammates example and was in 
the air and before the Youma had regained footage an ofuda that was 
literally blazing with spiritual power, as much as I could tell, was 
tucked onto the Youma&#39;s forehead, effectively freezing it.
	&quot;Moon, now!&quot; Luna, who had somehow appeared next to me, 
reminded me of the perfect opportunity. I looked at the staff in my 
hand for a moment, refocusing on my earlier wish... no pledge. I said 
I would give everything for the safety of those I loved and I would. 
Shall it mean being a Princess, a warrior without rest, a life full 
of danger. At least it would be with my friends and loved ones.
	&quot;MOON PRINCESS HALATION!&quot;
	A beam of transparent power, filled with dozens, hundreds of 
little crescent moon sigils, struck the paralyzed Youma. It gave a 
horrendous, bone-chilling scream and then crumbled to dust.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
Several minutes later we had all retreated into a deserted back alley 
to tend to our... the Senshi&#39;s wounds. There were plenty to tend to 
and Hotaru had immediately offered to help out with the more severe 
ones. The adrenaline of the battle was just beginning to leave their 
veins and they had just began to realize what happened. As much as 
the mass attack was new for an enemy tactic, that at least could have 
been rationalized. A sniper attempt, an ambush like this was just... 
It reminded me too much of the old days.
	Although the Silver Millennium was very much a beautiful and 
peaceful place, it was as with every such place. There always were 
people who didn&#39;t agree with the current structure and sort own power 
in one or another way, even before Beryl. Such attacks like today 
were rare and barely as effective or dangerous as this one. Still, 
our Senshi here, did not have most of the memories and recollection 
of their training how to deal with such a situation. They usually 
just rushed out and fought whatever could be a harm to other people. 
In the old days - and it should have been now as well - the first 
priority would have been to get Serenity to safety.
	&quot;What the hell were you thinking? No, let me rephrase this 
because you weren&#39;t even thinking!&quot; That was Venus, although about 
ninety percent was Hebe speaking. A good thing I wasn&#39;t the only one 
who had at least semi-good memories of the past. These days I 
sometimes thought my partner had better ones than I had maintained 
through the stasis. Her anger and irritation right now was directed 
at Mars. The two were standing some distance away and continuing the 
battle in a screaming match. No, it was more like Venus screaming 
while Mars was silently fuming... until now.
	&quot;What? Should I have let it rampage through the whole city?&quot; 
Mars shot back sarcastically. Venus&#39; eyes flashed for a brief moment 
and Mars backed up slightly. &quot;Our first duty is to protect our 
Princess,&quot; she stated calmly which made the other Senshi flinch 
inwardly. &quot;If you were thinking clearly, you would have realized that 
the attack was meant for us. US. We could have led it away if you 
hadn&#39;t headfirst jumped it.&quot; She impressed me again and again these 
days. Venus had become even more responsible since meeting Hotaru. I 
believe it was a lot of the protector instinct towards her mate that 
prompted that deeper concentration. What mattered though was that she 
became every bit the leader as she had been in the Past.
	As much as in the Silver Millennium, Mars was never one to 
back down when driven by her temper. And so she didn&#39;t right now as 
well. &quot;Excuse me? Who brought us into danger first, hmm? You let an 
outsider knew who we are.&quot; Bad move. &quot;Leave Hotaru out of this, Rei. 
I told you already it was in no way intended.&quot; Mars arched an 
eyebrow. &quot;Oh right,&quot; she drew out the word, &quot;as much as it wasn&#39;t 
intended to fall in love with her, another girl, as much as you were 
more worried the whole time about her than about us in that battle. 
Do you think I couldn&#39;t tell?&quot;
	I wanted to say something at this point since I took that as 
a personal insult to my and Priapos training but kept quiet, not 
really looking forward to draw the Fire Senshi&#39;s attention to me. &quot;I 
have no idea what your problem today is, Mars. But if you keep 
treating my MATE like that, you will regret it.&quot; Again my partner&#39;s 
eyes were flashing with a dangerous gleam and still Mars wasn&#39;t 
relenting. Staring deep into the blonde&#39;s eyes, I had to thank my cat 
ears to hear the next words. &quot;You have no idea what you are getting 
into with her, do you?&quot; At that I silently shook my head. No, Mars 
was the one who had no idea, Venus knew better than anyone else here, 
much better.
	The leader of the Inner Senshi regarded her teammate with a 
look that could have frozen over Hell. &quot;Are you implying that Hotaru 
had something to do with,&quot; She made a gesture with her hand in the 
direction of the nearby Parlor, &quot;this?&quot; Of course the dark-haired 
Senshi gave the wrong answer to this. &quot;Maybe.&quot;
	The slap that echoed through the alley made everyone flinch. 
I knew they were all watching the exchange out of the corner of their 
eyes. Mercury who was bandaging Jupiter&#39;s sore side jumped a little 
while the taller Senshi just shook her head. Priapos sitting atop a 
crate held a hand to her forehead. Usagi, Mamoru and Hotaru who were 
talking quietly in another corner winced and shot looks varying from 
sadness to pity to a silent chiding from Usagi. I glanced over at 
Luna and caught her muttering something along the lines of: &quot;Why does 
no one listen to me anymore.&quot; Mars should have, that was for sure.
	&quot;I suggest you first come down from whatever trip you are on, 
Mars, before making such accusations again. I know my mate better 
than you can even imagine and I would NEVER do anything to endanger 
our safety. You, however, did today. So think about that first before 
trying to see things where they aren&#39;t.&quot; It was a wonder how Venus 
managed to hold her voice calm and even enough to not shake or morph 
into outright screaming. As it was the words were even sharper and 
after another moment of silently glaring at Venus, a hand to her 
cheek, Mars turned away and stalked out of the alley.
	An uncomfortable silence settled for about two minutes over 
the alley, none daring to move or say anything. Then, as if someone 
had snapped their fingers, Venus seemed to waver slightly and her 
knees threatened to buckle underneath her. It was a testament to 
their love, their strong bond and how much they got to know each 
other in those few months already that Hotaru was there to catch her 
mate the moment she collapsed to the ground. I mean, I hadn&#39;t even 
seen it coming and I knew Venus for a long, long time now.
	The scene though reminded me a lot of the one at the festival 
in England, the one where Minako and she had their first official 
date. It had been that night that Priapos had shown up first - still 
under the enemy&#39;s influence - and it had broken Venus&#39; heart to stand 
up to her kin sister in protecting Hotaru. When the elf had left it 
was similar, even if I believed that she wouldn&#39;t shut herself out 
from everyone as she did then. But seeing her there, on the cold 
pavement, gathered in the smaller girl&#39;s arms a few silent, wrecking 
sobs disrupting the general silence, made me loathe at the Fire 
Senshi. Mars had no idea how much she hurt my partner with this.
	&quot;I didn&#39;t want to... She... It&#39;s just...&quot; Hotaru made 
soothing noises while the others looked on uncomfortably. I caught 
Moon looking out of the alley with a strange, almost enraged 
expression - if it wasn&#39;t so impossible for her -, before she turned 
back to the crouched couple and kneeled down next to them. Putting a 
hand on Venus&#39; shoulder she smiled one of her most brightening and 
reassuring smiles. &quot;Don&#39;t make yourself reproach for something that 
isn&#39;t your fault. I&#39;ll speak with Rei, okay?&quot; After awhile Venus 
quieted down and nodded. She seemed rather embarrassed at the 
emotional breakdown but none of the others dared to meet her eyes 
right now.
	&quot;Alright, minna. I think we should all go home and rest,&quot; 
Moon announced and was met with silent approval from everyone.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mamoru)
What was that power? The question spooked around in my head ever 
since we left the scene, a quiet devastated scene of pure 
destruction. The repair crews would have a lot to do. My mind kept 
wandering back to that moment than we had somehow brought forth 
Moon&#39;s new staff. All three of us that is, although I wasn&#39;t sure if 
Hotaru hadn&#39;t been merely an amplifier. As hard as it was to believe 
that there was such strong power inside of me, it was even harder to 
believe that the dark-haired girl was responsible for more than a 
fraction.
	This was driving me crazy. It had been much like yesterday 
than I somehow joined with Moon and Venus. How and what exactly I had 
summoned in that moment I was not sure up to this point but it was 
something very potential. Had Serenity been right? Was there a power 
inside of me, one that I wasn&#39;t aware of. I really had to find an 
answer to that because if I didn&#39;t I might regret it soon. Today 
Usagi had almost been killed by the Youma and I hadn&#39;t been much help 
in protecting her either.
	However, that was something I could think about than I had a 
moment of peace and quiet. Right now I was more interested in 
something different. Quietly making my way over to the raven-haired 
girl, standing a little to the side and throwing worried glances the 
way where Venus and Mars were arguing. Other than Mars I wasn&#39;t 
suspicious or anything. No, through the brief contact today I had 
felt with an absolute clarity that her feelings for Venus were above 
all dominant and genuine. I had felt a lot of the devotion I held for 
my Usagi and that made me curious. Of course the fact that I had now 
an answer to my strange, embarrassing dream this night was important 
as well...
	Neither of us spoke for a moment when I leaned back against 
the wall next to her. Finally I decided to break the ice. &quot;Arigato, 
for helping us like that. You helped me twice already.&quot; I smiled 
gently at her, trying to soothe the nervous girl. Hotaru had provided 
some healing after the battle, even to Rei who had to be practically 
ordered by Usagi to accept the offer. I had no idea what the miko&#39;s 
problem was but that seemed to go beyond simple stress. There was a 
lot more going on when she shared with everyone. I should know, I 
dated her for awhile after all.
	&quot;That&#39;s okay. I&#39;m glad I could help.&quot; Despite her words, 
Hotaru&#39;s face brightened slightly at my gratitude. There was another 
period of silence and I saw Usagi moving away from Mercury and 
Jupiter and making her way over to us. Not really wanting to worry my 
girlfriend for the moment, I decided to ask the question that had 
been on my mind all this time right away. &quot;Um, are you aware of what 
you did back then?&quot; I phrased it carefully. No one had quiet noticed 
in the heat of the moment but my position had allowed me to have a 
good look when the Youma suddenly froze up, paralyzed on the spot 
actually. And that had been when Hotaru had looked at it. I wasn&#39;t 
quite sure if the brief color flash in her eyes was imagination or 
real but she HAD done something. That much I was sure of.
	Hotaru fidgeted. &quot;I&#39;m... not quite sure. I just wanted to 
heal you but somehow we linked like you and Venus did yesterday. 
After that, I... don&#39;t really know. Sometimes I have those blackouts. 
Even now that I&#39;m not sick anymore, they haven&#39;t gone away. And it 
scares me sometimes.&quot; Blackouts? She didn&#39;t know what she did, was 
the logical conclusion that I could draw from that. I had the feeling 
Minako knew. She had been with the younger girl far longer and if she 
had those blackouts often... Looking over at the arguing pair I made 
a mental note not to mention this in Rei&#39;s presence and to speak with 
the blonde later.
	&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; I tried to reassure her. &quot;I&#39;m sure it&#39;s 
nothing bad. You DID manage to help us destroy that Youma after all.&quot; 
Hotaru smiled a bit more at this, her almost humble demeanor 
beginning to change to a more relaxed one. Usagi had by now made her 
way over to us. &quot;Everything alright?&quot; I asked worried that there had 
been any deeper injuries that we had overlooked. Usagi looked back 
over her shoulder and then shook her head. &quot;No, everything is fine.&quot; 
Sending a smile Hotaru&#39;s way that you couldn&#39;t help but brighten at 
the sight, she added: &quot;Thanks to you, Hotaru-chan.&quot; The younger girl 
blushed and Usagi winked at her.
	&quot;Um...&quot; my girlfriend began anew, obviously searching for 
words. I eyed her curiously at her sudden tongue-tied behavior. 
Usually Usagi was not one to hesitate when speaking her mind. &quot;What I 
wanted to ask is, um... Did Minako and you do something, um... 
yesterday night.&quot; The last bit had been pressed out in a squeak and I 
had to choke back one myself which in turn earned me a look and 
raised eyebrow from my girlfriend. Hotaru, for her part, was confused 
first but then caught on with what the blonde was implying and 
immediately colored tremendously.
	&quot;Arigato,&quot; I chose to say before any more embarrassment could 
arise. &quot;I think that answers ou... her question.&quot; Which of course 
only made the poor girl stammer something incoherently. &quot;Err... You 
see... I think it was because you linked yesterday and... um, that 
probably, um... reflected on your dreams... right?&quot; Usagi giggled 
suddenly, patting Hotaru, much to the girl&#39;s dismay, on her 
head. &quot;You don&#39;t have to explain yourself. WE,&quot; She shot me a glare 
to which I winced, &quot;can very well imagine.&quot;
	Leave it to Usagi to make even a complete stranger feel 
comfortable. That was one of the qualities that made her so special. 
To me, to the girls and everyone who met her. Only seeing her surface 
did do her injustice. It was her heart, her soul that truly shown 
like a single star in the night. Right now Hotaru saw it too and 
quickly relaxed soon happily chatting with my girlfriend about this 
and that.
	I leaned back and watched them, once again my resolve 
strengthened. Yes, having Usagi as a girlfriend was a blessing. I 
could very well overlook the embarrassment that she sometimes caused 
for just being with such a happy, warm-hearted girl. Usagi herself 
had made an incredible jump on the emotional side as well. Accepting 
that the period of peace was over and that the simple life she had 
wished for anyone would not come to be was hard on her. But she had 
found her way again. Her faith had cleared away the obstacles she had 
set for herself. Sailormoon, the warrior, was back.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Hotaru)
&quot;Arigato for helping out, Oneechan.&quot; I had come to regard the fiery 
redheaded elf as much a sister as she was to my mate. By terminology 
she was as much as this now anyway. Priapos smiled wryly. &quot;My 
pleasure, little one. It was the least I could do after not being 
able to help much more today.&quot; I shook my head at the elf and 
motioned her to put an exhausted Minako on the bed. &quot;You saved Kino-
san and the rest as well in the process. We wouldn&#39;t have even been 
all there without you.&quot;
	The Efadio took the flattering comment in stride and looking 
down at her kin sister, she twirled the thick tendril - a symbol of 
their shared kinship - on her wrist lost in thought. &quot;I rarely have 
seen her like this. It pains me that she has to fight so much for her 
happiness.&quot; Priapos looked at me with that kind of look that made you 
squirm even though you know there was no actual reason to do so. &quot;You 
will make her happy, will you? You will not hurt her as the others 
did?&quot; Experiences, shared dreams and the common search for the 
missing part in both our lives made me answer without hesitating, 
without actually stopping to consider, to think. There was nothing to 
think about, nothing to consider. I could not turn back again. The 
bond was formed and to severe it now would be unbearable, our lives 
would be damned into misery. And on top of that I could not even 
imagine how a life without the blonde could be. They could accuse us, 
they could burn us for all it was worth, I would not leave her side 
as long as she would have me and longer if necessary.
	I didn&#39;t reply verbally. I did not even make a sound. 
However, the moment the realization of the intensity our bond 
represented set in like it had so often before, I felt a quiet 
determination and at the same time tranquility flood through me that 
I knew were mirrored in my eyes.
	Priapos held my gaze for a moment longer, then turned 
away. &quot;Good.&quot; Stepping away from the bed, she turned to make her way 
out of the room. &quot;She&#39;ll need some comfort when she comes to. I leave 
that to you.&quot; I winced slightly at the smirk accompanying the 
word &quot;comfort&quot;. A moment later the elf dodged an incoming 
pillow. &quot;Oh, get going. We&#39;d like to have our privacy,&quot; I retorted 
and Priapos laughed whole heartily, before slipping out of the room.
	I turned back to the bed, regarding the blonde girl - in more 
than one aspect already young woman - with a mixture of worry and 
fondness. All in all that meeting had have went a lot different from 
what both of us had suspected. It was neither the one nor the other 
extreme. Neither the open welcome from anyone nor the suspicion and 
rejection I had feared despite my mate&#39;s reassurance. I believed Kino-
san - I was not yet quite comfortable to call them by their given 
name - when she said that her friend was usually not THAT 
mistrusting. I could tell that Hino-san was troubled by more than 
just stress. An impending decision was weighing her down and that 
reflected on her mood. I could not deny that her words and pointed 
looks hadn&#39;t hurt but was not that judgmental to throw such signs in 
the wind.
	Nevertheless Minako had stood up for me and that had made me 
sort of proud even though my first reaction was worry and a little 
guilt that involuntary my presence this day had caused her to fight 
with her friend and sister-in-arms. That must have hurt almost as 
much as confronting Priapos back then and for a moment I was 
painfully reminded of this time. A time that had both tested but also 
strengthened our love.
	Stubborn as she was Minako had refused any help when the 
group decided to return to our individual home and had promptly 
collapsed from emotional exhaustion. Thankfully Priapos had been 
there to help carry her home and for once I was glad that Minako&#39;s 
parents were out of town.
	That would be another thing. Minako&#39;s birthday was coming 
soon and the Ainos would return. Explaining why I was staying was 
rather unnecessary. I&#39;m not quite sure what Minako had told them 
about this but they never seemed to object. Otherwise they seemed to 
not care about a lot of other things as well. I cursed them for this, 
knowing from own experience how it was to grow up with the lack of a 
parental figure. Father never had had much time for me and after 
overhearing him and that witch yesterday I was not sure if he ever 
was... No, if he ever had been my father anymore since the accident. 
How the Ainos could ignore their daughter like this was beyond me and 
infuriated me at the same time.
	One thing was for sure. With us living together for some time 
again and with the tense situation between the Senshi and us right 
now, I was sure that our secret would come out, most likely sooner 
than later. And THAT would shake them out of their lethargy. I wasn&#39;t 
quite sure though if we would survive the following storm.
	A gentle touch on my hand made me focus back on my girlfriend 
who was looking at me strangely. &quot;Why such sad thoughts. I could care 
less what they think. Let them wake up and realize that their little 
baby daughter is all grown up.&quot; Minako reached up with her other hand 
to touch my cheek and I leaned against it, melting into the 
touch. &quot;That doesn&#39;t change that I love you. No matter what.&quot; Tears 
sprang from my eyes as the stormy blue of her eyes met mine, 
expressing all the conflicting emotions that were love, devotion and 
compassion in one.
	&quot;Throughout life and death,&quot; I said as if reciting a prayer.
	&quot;Throughout love and hate,&quot; Minako answered.
	I smiled and she smiled and as I bent down to place a gentle 
kiss on her lips, I knew that my answer to Priapos would hold true 
and that all I expressed was not just a hollow concept but my faith 
as much as it was my fate.
	Despite the elf&#39;s suggestive remarks we did not comfort each 
other THAT way this night. For the moment we were just able to hold 
each other and relish in the feeling of belonging, safety and 
rightness that was us.

(Luna)
The late night air was chilling and uncomfortable but I endured it, 
perched high on my post opposite the house... mansion if you want. My 
sensitive ears were straining to catch any glimpses of conversation 
that might occur inside. Normally it would be impossible, even for a 
cat, to hear anything through closed walls so far away. However, my 
race inherited not simple cat genes but also abilities far beyond any 
of Chikyuu&#39;s kind. Not that I wanted to compare our proud race to the 
alley cats and lazy house ones. No, definitely not.
	One of my gifts was coming in handy right now as I managed to 
block out all my other senses and focusing only on hearing in an 
enclosed, rather small radius. That way I could never cover a wider 
range but it was quite useful to spy on others, especially enemies. I 
admit Artemis was better at this. However, I had not wanted him to do 
this. I did not even want him to know I was here right now.
	I might have relented that Artemis would not tell me more 
about what had been going on, that did not hinder me to follow my 
instincts though. Today something had happened that deeply troubled 
me and I knew it would leave me no rest until I found my suspicion 
confirmed or refuted. The Prince had caught it as well, I had seen it 
in his eyes but unlike me I believed that he didn&#39;t quite understand 
what exactly it was. I, on the other hand, had a creepy suspicion 
that I did. Not in detail though, and that was why I was here. To 
find answers, to find truths. Otherwise I feared not to be able to 
trust them again.
	&quot;It couldn&#39;t have been imagination,&quot; I muttered quietly to 
myself, frustrated at the lack of activity inside Tomoe-ke. No, it 
could definitely not have been imagination. Not the appearance of the 
Moon Staff had frozen the Youma&#39;s movements. No, Hotaru had. How I 
had no idea but in both the joining which produced my charge&#39;s new 
weapon and in that icy stare that had briefly flashed over the young 
girl&#39;s face as the Youma had moved in for the kill, lay power, a 
power that was at the same time hauntingly familiar as much as it was 
unlike anything I had felt before. And that was quite a lot. These 
emotionless yet piercing eyes locking the Dark Kingdom&#39;s creature in 
their gaze were forever branded into my mind though.
	After the battle was over I had quietly excused myself from 
Usagi&#39;s side and went to follow the elf and Hotaru as they brought an 
emotional collapsed Minako home. For a moment I had considered 
confronting the elf but decided against it. The oath of loyalty and 
kinship would as much prevent her from giving me straight answers as 
Artemis did. No, they would not tell me as long as Minako did not 
wish them to. And that she knew what was going on with her girlfriend 
was more than evident. It had been her attack that had slammed into 
the Youma first and broken the spell after her mate had somehow 
disabled its movements.
	Straining my senses even more I was finally rewarded for my 
efforts when the voices of two people invaded my hearing space. One 
older, male voice and one female... That had to be Professor Tomoe 
and his assistant. Artemis was quite certain that nobody else lived 
in the house. The voice I assumed to be Professor Tomoe spoke first 
in a tired tone: &quot;Would you quit being so paranoid? She can&#39;t stay 
away forever. We know that and she knows that. What we should do now 
is prepare Megumi properly. It is evident that the Mistress has 
chosen her now.&quot; I frowned at the words but filed it away for later 
use. I needed all my concentration to keep up the enhancement of my 
senses.
	The assistant seemed rather irritated and agitated at the 
professor. &quot;Paranoid? The child could doom us all and you know that. 
Her union with the other one has already cost us her as the perfect 
vessel. Now her spirit is free and you very well know that it is her 
that the Master fears!&quot; Unimpressed by his assistants outburst 
Professor Tomoe replied evenly: &quot;The light that threatens our world 
will not rise again. She will not rise her weapon against her own 
blood sister.&quot; I nearly fell out of the tree at this. Sister? Were 
they talking about Hotaru? They had never talked much about Hotaru&#39;s 
family and I knew that not even Minako seemed to know more than a few 
details. What was all that about.
	While the last comment did not manage to make me lose my 
concentration, it was a tremendous effort from my part that the 
assistant&#39;s angry reply did not manage to do it either, very 
barely. &quot;Listen to you! The child is the reincarnation of Saturn, 
damn it! That&#39;s what she is born to do! Fulfill her destiny albeit 
any consequence.&quot;
	Although I did not fell out of the tree or completely lost my 
concentration what was further said did not register anymore as the 
information set in with an icy shock, a terror and disbelief beyond 
imagination. Hotaru, sweet, innocent Hotaru was... Oh Goddess, by 
Serenity, what have you done? I looked up into the night sky, all but 
glaring up at the Moon. Hotaru was Sailorsaturn. The final one, the 
last resort. The Senshi of Death. And suddenly it made all a horrible 
sense that none of them wanted to tell me because they knew. While 
the Senshi spirit was dormant right now, Minako, Artemis and Priapos 
knew. And I was sure that was not because they had seen the symbol 
flash. There simply was no other way when Hotaru had really been 
possessed by a demon and was sick beyond human healing capabilities. 
It had to be Saturn&#39;s doing. &quot;What have you done to them, Serenity?&quot; 
I whispered up at the pale moon, for the first time since going into 
service not understanding my Queen anymore. And that it had to be her 
doing was painfully clear.
	&quot;You weren&#39;t supposed to learn this now.&quot; This time I fell 
out of the tree. At the last moment managing to turn my fall into a 
semi-graceful landing, I whirled around. Leaning against the tree as 
if she had been standing there the entire time without me noticing - 
which was virtually impossible, was a tall woman with some kind of 
staff in her hand. As the light of the Moon once again emerged from 
behind a cloud and she stepped out of the shadows, I suddenly 
realized that I really couldn&#39;t have told that she was there as long 
as the woman didn&#39;t want me to.
&quot;Greetings, Counselor Luna.&quot; The black-haired woman with a touch of 
green highlighting the long hair smiled somewhat ruefully. I let out 
a gasp, identifying the staff in the shape of a long key and the red 
sphere resting on top of it, the Senshi fuku in a shade of black that 
could be either that or a very dark red-brown. &quot;You...&quot; I never got 
more out of it before the red orb flashed brightly for a moment and I 
felt blissful darkness claim me. The last thing I heard were Pluto&#39;s 
apologetic words. &quot;I am truly sorry, Lady Luna. But what must be, 
must be. It was not yet your time to learn of this. When you awake 
you will not remember any of what you learned tonight about either 
Tomoe.&quot;

--------------
	Picking up the unconscious but peaceful resting cat, 
Sailorpluto allowed herself another rueful sigh. This job was getting 
too painful and she wasn&#39;t sure if she could do it all over again. 
Seeing the Silver Millennium fall was enough already. Now everything 
seemed to start all over again.
	&quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; Pluto inclined her head towards 
the white cat who had stepped into the soft moonlight, glaring at her 
silently. She wanted to tell him &quot;No&quot;, she wanted to take it back and 
just leave things their way. Unfortunately that option was not 
available to a Guardian of Time who had to watch that things went 
correctly.
	Lifting the Time Staff, the red orb flared once more and 
almost instantly space seemed to warp around the pair and the other 
cat in the Senshi&#39;s arms. A moment later they found themselves just 
outside Tsukino-ke. Finally deciding to give an answer to Artemis&#39; 
question, Pluto put Luna gently down next to him. &quot;Yes. She would 
have not concentrated on your current enemy anymore with those 
information at this stage.&quot;
	The white cat shook his head, not dropping the stare. &quot;And 
you are still not going to tell us about that current enemy.&quot; The 
sarcasm was obvious to the blindest fool. Pluto did not let it affect 
her. &quot;No. Not yet. Do not concern yourself with Professor Tomoe and 
his involvements. This is Outer Senshi business and will not come to 
pass until you are finished with this threat.&quot;
	And before the cat could reply the Senshi of Time had already 
vanished. Artemis gave a huff. &quot;Figures. As if I expected to get a 
straight answer.&quot; Draping Luna over his own limited body the white 
cat made his way slowly up to the house. &quot;I just hope you know what 
you are doing, Pluto. I just hope you know what you are doing.&quot;

TBC in Episode 3

The Senshi must deal with the numerous conflicts arising in their 
public as well as secret lives. And they are soon to experience the 
training drill of a certain elf. Be there for when our heroines - and 
hero - are introduced to a form of training that will make Luna 
appear tame.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

Venus: And here we are again. (looks around) What is this supposed to 
be again?
Moon: *popping in as a giant head looming over Venus* THE MORAL!
Venus: *shrinking back in fear* Ehehe, no need to get upset, Usagi-
chan... *scratches head* A moral, he? Well, let&#39;s see... Hmm... 
Mmmh...
*Five minutes later Venus is still racking her brain about it*
Saturn (signing in): Come on, its way past your bedtime, missy. 
(grabs Venus who is not at all protesting but still deep in thought)
Venus and Saturn have signed off
Moon: *irritated* What about MY MORAL?
Mars (signing in): Stop whining about it. Nobody is going to go along 
with your idiotic idea. *begins to drag off a kicking Moon* Now, come 
on. You have other duties to attend to.
Mars and Moon have signed off
Artemis: *coming out of hiding* If you let me. *looks around* Oh, 
nobody is here anymore. Well, then I suppose I can go as well. *looks 
back at screen* Huh, you want to know the moral? No wait. I bet Usagi 
and Minako want the moral, right? Right. Here it comes. *clears 
throat* Today&#39;s moral I think is that friends (and family too) can&#39;t 
be expected to always react as you want them to. Minako hoped for the 
acceptance of her and Hotaru from her friends and although she mostly 
got that, not everyone was quite happy about it. Sometimes our life 
just becomes to stressful and unpredictable. We feel as if everyone 
and everything is out to haunt us. Often we let it out on the persons 
who least deserve it but at those time we often don&#39;t care about the 
hurt we might inflict too much. Rei had one of those days and Luna 
too in her own way. That&#39;s it, I say. Ja!
Artemis has signed off.

Author&#39;s Notes

Thank Maia that you got that so soon. Everything up from Makoto&#39;s 
scene had been produced in roughly two days this weekend.

What to say to this part? Let&#39;s start with Mamoru. You might wonder 
what I&#39;m off about his powers. Anyone familiar with the Manga can 
answer that question and there was a reference to a familiar quote 
taken from the Dreams arc as well. Anyone who doesn&#39;t have a clue, 
well, I&#39;m not to spoil your fun. :)

Ami&#39;s cameo has been found as you saw. I thought that one was close 
enough for someone to equal Ami&#39;s skills remotely.

About Minako attending a private school. Well, we don&#39;t know for sure 
if they all have lived in Azabu-Juuban or Tokyo at all for their 
entire lives. We know that Makoto had been on a different school 
before coming to Juuban. So why shouldn&#39;t some of the Senshi have 
been in different wards or a different city altogether?

Reference to Luna and Artemis&#39; pasts are more or less a merge of the 
Mau (Manga) origin and the one done in Sailormoon Z (at least the 
social bit).

Makoto&#39;s chi attack is put together as followed. Kongou means 
diamond/adamantine/thunderbolt/vajra/Indra&#39;s weapon/Buddhist symbol 
of the indestructible truth and Gihei means soldier or army dedicated 
to a righteous cause. I think you can gather it from here.

Why I made Rei the one to spoil the fun? Several reasons that will be 
uncovered over the course of the next episodes. I do NOT hate Rei. 
Furthest from it. I could never bring myself to outright hate a 
character. Despise maybe, annoyed or simply fed up with but not 
hate... Well, maybe Genma is an exception to the rule. :)

No, honestly now. It is bad style to let your like or dislike of a 
character influence how you write them. I mentioned that in Tanbo&#39;s 
first part. Bashing is a sign of laziness and that you are not 
willingly to really make the effort of understanding the character&#39;s 
behavior deeper. I tried to write my characters as objective as 
possible. There is a difference between bashing and making a 
character appear bad. APPEAR. I&#39;m not bashing Rei. Point.

The last scene of this episode was not planned AT ALL! Honestly, it 
wasn&#39;t. I didn&#39;t want anyone to find out up to this point. Not Mamoru 
suspecting something either. I didn&#39;t want Pluto added already. But 
the Luna scene only developed because I had to write one for symmetry 
reasons and Maia just sprang that on me... I couldn&#39;t let go and 
Ayrki told me it gave her the exact same impression when she read it. 
So, that&#39;s how THIS got into the story. I have to see how to further 
deal with that surprise for not even you but more for me. We&#39;ll see.

That&#39;s it, I suppose. I hope I haven&#39;t left that much typos in the 
last scenes. I was kind of distracted, messenging with Ayrki at the 
same time. Anyway, I hope you liked; and make sure to check out our 
new archive at www.catstrio.de, if you haven&#39;t already. All mine and 
Ayrki&#39;s fics are there now. Be sure to give feedback to our 
stories... like this one! :)

Ja ne, yours
