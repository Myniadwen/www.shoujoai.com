<h1>Relaxation Techniques</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/peaceguy.html">Peaceguy</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The sound of a book closing was the only sound that filled the small 
library. 

Ami Mizuno sighed and rubbed her eyes. Midterms were coming up and she 
spent every available minute studying. She sighed again, her classes 
were particularly difficult. As a future doctor she did her best to fill 
her schedule up with math and science classes.Currently she was taking 
advanced biology, anatomy, chemisty, advanced algebra, and the only 
non-science/math class: music theroy. And she was begining to become 
very stressed. The twenty-year-old freshman rubbed her eyes again. 
Suddenly the door opened and a feminine voice spoke softly, 

&quot;Ami-chan are you okay?&quot;  

Ami looked up to see her friend Rei Hino smiling at her. Ami smiled 
back, 

&quot;I&#39;m okay, just tired. And you?&quot;  

&quot;I&#39;m good, but studying as much as you do isn&#39;t healthy.&quot; Rei said, her 
pretty face filled with concern. Ami shrugged. 

&quot;I&#39;ve got to study, I need to maintain a good GPA so I can get into 
Tokyo med school.&quot; Rei sighed. 

&quot;You&#39;ll do fine, you&#39;re the smartest girl I know.Don&#39;t worry, you&#39;ll be 
the best doctor in Tokyo.&quot; Rei smiled sweetly, while Ami blushed. 

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know about the best, but I&#39;ll do my best to help others.&quot; 
Rei nodded. 

&quot;And you can&#39;t do that if you have a mental breakdown, come on I have 
two tickets to a very nice day resort and you look like you need a 
break.&quot;  

&quot;Where did you get them?&quot;  Rei&#39;s smile became bigger. 

&quot;I got them for my birthday, from a pretty, smart doctor-to be.&quot; Rei 
giggled, and Ami blushed; she&#39;d forgotten she had given Rei those 
tickets. &quot;Let&#39;s go&quot; Rei said holding out a hand. 

&quot;But I have studying to do.&quot; Ami said pointing to her books. 

&quot;If you don&#39;t come willingly, I&#39;ll drag you out.&quot; Rei said in a 
mock-threatening voice. Ami sighed once more. 

&quot;Okay, but just for a little while.&quot; 

&quot;Great! Put your books away and then we&#39;ll go to my car.&quot;  

Ami nodded, grabbed all her books and followed Rei to their dorm, by a 
fourtunate coincidence Rei and Ami shared the same dorm room. After 
walking back to their dorm, Ami put her books in their usual places and 
then the two of them walked to Rei&#39;s dark red chrystler. As they drove 
Ami turned to Rei. 

&quot;Rei-chan why didn&#39;t you invite Usagi-chan,  Mako-chan, or Minako-chan?&quot; 
Rei blushed slightly,she hoped Ami wouldn&#39;t figure out her real reason 
for inviting her. 

&quot; Um.. well Usagi is being helped by Setsuna-san in math, Minako-chan 
and Mako-chan are having &#39;quality girl-time&#39; as they say, and of course 
Haruka-san, Michiru-san and Hotaru-chan are all hanging out; so I asked 
you. Besides you need to relax.&quot; She finished with a smile. Ami smiled 
back, 

&quot;Well thank you, I can&#39;t wait to get in the spa!&quot; Both began to laugh 
happily. 
 
 

      The day-spa was rather big. It had an indoor pool, several hot 
tubs, a natural hot spring, spas, mud baths, the works. Rei and Ami 
walked up to the front desk. A cheerful looking young woman smiled at 
them. 

&quot;Hello welcome to the Sapphic Spa! The one and only spa specifically for 
women. How will you be paying?&quot; Rei held out the two tickets and the 
woman nodded. 

&quot;Oh good, many people buy these for friends. You must have a very good 
friend to give these to you.&quot; 

&quot;Of course, she&#39;s the best,&quot; Rei said looking at Ami. The woman noticed 
this and smiled knowingly at Rei, who winked back. The Sapphic Spa was 
famous for serving a particular type of women... 

Lesbians.

Ami of course, had been given the tickets by Michiru and Haruka, who had 
said that Rei would love it if Ami in particular would them to her. Ami 
hadn&#39;t known why they bought two, but now she knew. Ami blushed again as 
she looked at Rei out of the corner of her eye. Ami had had a crush on 
Rei since she met her, she never knew that Rei liked other women, she 
thought Rei was just picky and hadn&#39;t found the right man. Well she and 
Ami had something in common. The two walked down a hall. 

&quot;Hey Ami-chan, do you want to go into the pool or hot spring? We&#39;ll do 
whatever you want.&quot; Rei smiled, secretly nervous; she knew Ami didn&#39;t 
have a problem with Minako and Makoto, or Haruka and Michiru, or Usagi 
and Setsuna; but she didn&#39;t know if Ami liked women.  

She was in for quite a surprise. 

Ami smiled and shrugged, 

&quot;Why not go into the pool.. oh, but we didn&#39;t bring suits.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s okay, they rent suits to people.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, okay then&quot;  

They went into the locker room, Rei walked up to a woman in a booth and 
rented a blue one piece suit for Ami, and a dark red one for herself. 
They changed quickly, sneaking looks at each other occasionaly. Soon 
they put their clothes in lockers and walked out to the pool. Ami dove 
right in, Rei slid in. They spent a few minutes swimming around and 
floating on the water, after a while Rei looked over at Ami. The 
blue-haired girl was in her element, floating easily on the water. She 
looked like a water nymph, looking so peaceful and content in the water. 
Rei looked at her with affection. Ami sat up and smiled, then grinning; 
she splashed Rei. Rei giggled, 

&quot;You&#39;re gonna get it!&quot; They both laughed as they spent the next twenty 
minutes splashing and chasing each other. Rei was a good swimmer, but 
she couldn&#39;t keep up with Ami. After floating around for a little while 
more Ami looked at Rei. 

&quot;Hey Rei-chan, can we go to the hot spring now, I&#39;m kind of cold.&quot; Rei 
nodded and together they got out and walked outside to the hot spring. 
It was fairly big and was completely deserted. They sank into the warm 
waters and sighed happily. For a while neither spoke, finally Rei 
decided to break the silence and ask Ami something she had been dying to 
know for a while. 

&quot;Ami-chan are you uncomfortable being here? This is a lesbian spa.&quot; 

Ami shook her head, &quot; No, and I&#39;m honored to be here with the most 
beautiful girl in the world, who&#39;ll soon be the best lawyer in the 
world.&quot; Rei blushed at the double complement. 

&quot;Do you have a problem with my being a lesbian, I mean..&quot; whatever Rei 
was going to say was cut off when Ami placed her hand over Rei&#39;s mouth. 

&quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong with being who you are, I&#39;d love you if you were 
straight,lesbian or bisexual.&quot; Rei smiled, and in a fit of delirious 
happiness; kissed Ami on the mouth. She was about to pull away, when two 
slender arms wrapped around her. The two leaned into the kiss, pulling 
each other close. After they broke apart, both were smiling happily. Ami 
giggled. 

&quot;I didn&#39;t expect that, but it was wonderful.&quot;  

Rei nodded, &quot;It was, I dind&#39;t realize you&#39;d enjoy kissing another 
woman.&quot; Ami giggled again, 

&quot;I&#39;ve dreamt of having my first kiss with a girl.&quot; 

&quot;That was your first kiss?!&quot; 

Ami laughed and nodded. 

&quot;It was and I&#39;m glad it was with you.. I..&quot; Ami stopped and blushed, not 
knowing how to express her feelings, &quot;I&#39;ve always liked you.. as more 
than a friend.&quot; What happened next surprised her. Rei launched forward 
and pressed her lips to Ami&#39;s again. After the two seperated again Ami 
noticed that there were tears in Rei&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;Ami-chan you don&#39;t know how long I&#39;ve wanted to hear that. Did you 
really mean you.. you..?&quot; Rei couldn&#39;t get out the words, she was so 
chocked up with emotion. Ami nodded.  

&quot;Yes Rei-chan, I love you with all my heart and soul; I want to spend my 
life with you.&quot; Ami could feel tears of happiness in her eyes. &quot; So um.. 
will you be my girlfriend?&quot;  

&quot;Yes, of course I will!&quot; Tears were flowing down their cheeks as they 
hugged each other tightly. After a few moments they decided to go to the 
spa, so they got up, dried themselves off and walked towards the spa. As 
they sat down in the steany room, they cuddled together as close as they 
could.  

&quot;This feels great&quot; Rei murmured, 

&quot;Yeah, the steam is good to help relieve tension.&quot;  

&quot;Not that, being with you.&quot; Ami smiled and kissed her. Rei smiled and 
kissed Ami&#39;s head. 

&quot;So do you feel better now, this is better than studying huh?&quot;  

&quot;Oh yes, I feel much better, thank you for bringing me here and for 
being with me.&quot; 

Rei smiled and held her close, &quot;I&#39;ll always be here for you Ami-chan.&quot;  

Ami sighed happily, &quot; And I&#39;ll always be here for you, forever.&quot;  

They cuddled close and enjoyed the relaxing atmosphere, and being with 
each other. 
 
 
 
 

Well that was the best I could do, I hoped you enjoyed it. If you have 
any requests I&#39;d be happy try write something else.</pre>
