<h1>When the Soul Speaks</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alkris.html">Al Kristopher</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Self-reliance. Why bother going to school when she already knew that 
truth? Self-reliance. To rely on one&#39;s self. To come up out of the pit 
on your own strength, with your own ropes and levers. She probably 
fashioned them herself, to boot. Self-reliance. She didn&#39;t want it, she 
liked being dependent, but she didn&#39;t have a choice. When her mother and 
father were killed in that plane crash, the only person she had to rely 
on was herself--and of course, from time to time, her dearest and 
closest friend Shinozaki. But for the majority of her life, Makoto L. 
Kino was self-reliant.

Hence, her strength. The girl&#39;s heart and will was something; her body 
was another deal. Being self-reliant, independent, for ten years or so 
forced her to grow up, to bulk up, to become this damsel that was never 
in distress. She vowed to earn her strength because being self-reliant, 
independent, meant that you had to be strong enough to take care of 
yourself. Makoto didn&#39;t want that, but she didn&#39;t have that freedom, 
that choice. She either had to become strong on her own or else fall 
into the pit and stay.

But trauma bears scars, and no strength save that of the love of others 
could cover up those gaps in her heart. Makoto was a lonely, lonely, 
loveless little soul, cold and scared and becoming hard like a chunk of 
ice. Loner. Antisocial. Karate freak. Knives dug through her ears and 
went straight to her heart, until it too decided to become strong, and 
formed a barrier of stone around it, to protect from the daggers. Maybe 
that was why she was such a vigilante. She saw herself as a protector of 
the weak, a schoolyard anti-bully force, a defender. She might have been 
Don Quixote for all her efforts.

And then there was Naru Osaka, hardly one of strength since her mother 
was alive and quite well (her father was another story). Owning a 
jewelry store simply did not result in living out on the street. She was 
pretty, sophisticated, and bright, even as a youngster, though she 
picked up much of her guile and razor&#39;s repertoire in the schools and 
streets. She only needed wit and charm to last through her years, and 
gentleness of the heart. She loved many but not all, and even those she 
did love were not loved completely, but the young woman was by all means 
a well of love, and certainly wit and charm were thrown in.

Naru only needed to rely on her wit and her charms to get her out of 
tight spots. Sometimes she outsmarted her problems and foes, or else 
used her friendliness and cheer to get past them. Her body was designed 
to be delicate and soft. Had she been in the same seat as Makoto, the 
same situation, there was no telling whether she would&#39;ve survived. But 
even Makoto had been frail once, a long time ago, and was now anything 
but. These two were not total opposites, though they had few 
similarities. The one outstanding thing they both had in common was that 
they attended the same school.

Yes, once upon a time, long ago, the charming Naru and the self-reliant 
Makoto once went to the same school. They didn&#39;t know each other--not 
just yet anyway, but a strange, sleight twist of fate determined 
otherwise. Fate required that a dependent person needed to fall into the 
care of an independent person for the meeting to work, and the two girls 
fit the descriptions perfectly. The act was ready to begin. All it 
needed was a little push in the right direction.

Naru Osaka was rudely shoved into the dirt by one of the many school 
bullies. It wasn&#39;t the first time it happened.

&quot;Well, get up. C&#39;mon, spoiled little rich girl, get up!&quot;

&quot;Why are you doing this to me?&quot; wailed poor Naru as she struggled to 
crawl to her feet. &quot;I never did anything bad to you! I&#39;m not spoiled or 
rich either! Come on, just leave me alone!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; insisted the bully, leaning in to leer at her. He had the face of 
a lizard and a disposition to match. &quot;Now gimme all your money! My 
friends and I are real hungry, and a puny little school sandwich just 
won&#39;t cut it. Now fork it over!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; she screamed, desperately raising her arm to defend herself. 
&quot;Leave me alone!&quot; Suddenly, the wind whistled sharply as a small object 
popped the bully on his head and landed neatly in the ground. It was a 
rose earring.

&quot;Ow!&quot;

&quot;Hey, you heard her, you bullies!&quot; barked a very strong voice from afar. 
The nasty kid turned around and paled, wide-eyed, as the schoolhouse 
&quot;karate freak&quot; stood defiant atop a jungle gym. He and his cohorts 
quickly scampered away, too frightened by stories and rumors about the 
person to test them. Naru was left on the ground, trembling a little as 
she waited for something to happen. She didn&#39;t know if her savior was 
there to help or hurt her.

As it turned out, the person was a tall, pretty girl with long, free 
flowing brunette hair, with the most heartwarming smile and the most 
beautiful earring. Naru noticed that she only had one, and it looked 
exactly like the one that had struck the bully. She smiled awkwardly as 
the tall girl extended her hand and asked if she was okay. She reached 
over and grabbed the small jeweled rose.

&quot;Uh, you dropped this,&quot; she managed. The brunette laughed quietly.

&quot;Yeah, I did. Had to get his attention somehow.&quot; She quietly affixed the 
jewel onto her ear, talking as she did. &quot;So what&#39;s your story? Those 
bullies are terrible, but they don&#39;t usually gang up on someone unless 
they have a reason. I heard them say you were rich or something.&quot;

&quot;No, not even remotely,&quot; managed Naru, and pulled herself up with the 
brunette&#39;s help. She was frankly amazed at how easily the taller girl 
picked her up from the dust. Perhaps those crazy &quot;karate freak&quot; rumors 
were true, at least partially. But no, she looked gentle and kind, 
perhaps too kind for that rough little world all the other mortals lived 
in.

&quot;So, what then?&quot;

&quot;Um, my mom just owns a jewelry store. I don&#39;t have any more money than 
the other kids do. My lunches and breakfasts are all the same.&quot; Naru 
smiled shyly and hugged herself as she realized her savior was staring. 
She blushed and stared down at the ground. The young lady smiled and 
raised her chin up delicately.

&quot;Well, please take care of yourself from now on. I&#39;ll be watching you 
just to make sure those morons don&#39;t come back, but maybe you should 
learn how to fight back as well.&quot;

&quot;Oh, but I couldn&#39;t do that!&quot; insisted the redhead. &quot;I don&#39;t know how to 
fight, and my mother doesn&#39;t like violence. Besides, I&#39;m a girl, and I&#39;d 
never be able to fight off those boys!&quot;

&quot;Then how do you explain me?&quot; countered brunette with a sly smile. Naru 
flushed.

&quot;Oh. Well, um... I mean... well, sorry. I didn&#39;t mean to say that it&#39;s 
not ladylike.&quot;

&quot;You do what you have to in order to stay a step ahead of the game,&quot; 
said the brunette gently. She gave Naru&#39;s shoulder a pat, and went off 
on her own before the stammering redhead could even ask her name. Naru 
was left by herself, but not for long, as the bell rang for everyone to 
come into class. She sighed, wondering what sorts of strange things the 
rest of the day would bring her. And she hoped to see that pretty girl 
again.

----------

It wasn&#39;t as if Naru obsessed over the beautiful stranger for the rest 
of the day (so much so that her studies were fazed out by the fa&ccedil;ade of 
a tall, gentle, karate maniac). Hardly. She was able to concentrate, 
able to answer questions and take quizzes. But for sure, her savior 
occupied her mind whenever she allowed it. It was like a tickling 
sensation in the back of her mind, something that nagged but not 
overbearingly so. Naru was more curious than she was obsessed, really. 
Who had that been?

Chances were that unless her harassers had wised up quickly, she would 
probably find out the hard way. If it came down to it, Naru would rather 
be safe and not know who the girl was, than be picked on again and find 
out. She wasn&#39;t na&iuml;ve, though. She anticipated another attack in the 
near future, probably sparked by the same illogical reason as before. So 
her mother owned a jewelry store. So what? Why did that make her more of 
a target than anyone else? Naru sucked on her lower lip nervously when 
she left school and began the long walk home.

No bully attacked her, and for the record, her fear that something even 
worse would jump out was never realized. Naru had to stop briefly, rub 
her face, and get a drink. She was starting to grow paranoid. She took a 
deep breath and kept walking. Naru actually was interrupted on the way 
home, but by somebody whom she knew she would be safe with, the very 
person who had saved her and who she was curious about. She smiled 
softly and gave a meek wave.

&quot;Uh, nice to see you again.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. So do you walk home?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm, every day. I don&#39;t know anybody who could drive me and the bus 
doesn&#39;t even go near where I live. It&#39;s good exercise.&quot;

&quot;Mind if I join you?&quot; she asked. Naru smiled.

&quot;Sure! I could use some company! You know, I&#39;ve been feeling very 
paranoid recently.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, ever since I got picked on by those boys today, all I can think 
about is getting attacked again. I moved on from the school to the 
sidewalk, and all of a sudden I&#39;m afraid of a burglar, or worse! Heh... 
pretty silly, huh?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; replied the brunette, stretching her arms behind her 
head as she walked. &quot;Sometimes even the safest neighborhoods can be 
dangerous. Maybe I should keep an eye on you just to be safe.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Naru gave her savior a warm, bright smile, and inched closer 
until they were walking directly side by side. Makoto Kino, the gentle 
&quot;karate maniac&quot;, smiled shyly at the shorter girl. She badly wanted to 
know her name.

&quot;So, ah, where exactly do you live? Maybe I can walk you home better if 
I knew.&quot; Naru slowed down and raised her hand above her, stabbing the 
air with her finger.

&quot;You see that avenue way over there? It&#39;s marked by all those lovely 
trees. In the spring their leaves turn pink and it smells gorgeous; in 
the fall, it looks like they&#39;re on fire.&quot; Makoto stood on her toes and 
squinted to see.

&quot;The one with the big weeping willow?&quot;

&quot;Yeah! I live right across from that tree!&quot; Makoto smiled and stood at 
her usual height.

&quot;A beautiful girl living in a beautiful neighborhood. Now I know why 
those creeps were after you.&quot; Naru blushed shyly and turned her face 
away. She had never been called beautiful before, at least not by a 
stranger.

&quot;Y-yeah?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm. They were jealous. I&#39;d be too, except I know you&#39;re not 
stuck-up about it. May I see where you live?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one who&#39;s walking me home!&quot; she exclaimed shyly. Makoto 
laughed, her face beaming with delight and joy. Naru couldn&#39;t help but 
stare at the simple face. She barely knew the young lady, yet already 
she was enamored with her. She was also just young enough and just 
innocent enough to feel such admiration, such a liking to the girl, 
without knowing any adulterations. This was merely the act of one human 
being attracted to another human through their innate goodness, and that 
was a very pure act indeed.

&quot;Well, come on,&quot; smiled Makoto after she finished laughing. &quot;I&#39;ll take 
you home, and maybe someday your parents will let you see mine. It&#39;s a 
really nice place, but it gets kinda empty.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Where do you live?&quot; Makoto smiled, her eyes twinkling just barely 
as she led the smaller redhead into the &quot;beautiful neighborhood&quot;.

&quot;Not far.&quot;

As usual, Naru came to an empty house, so she unlocked the outer door 
and led herself in. Her mother wouldn&#39;t be home until sometime that 
evening; her father wouldn&#39;t be home at all, to their grief. Inwardly, 
Naru was proud that her folks had &quot;divorce-proofed&quot; their partnership 
and remained faithful and loving all their years together, but the vow 
of being parted only by mortality had taken a very literal, very painful 
turn in the lives of the Osakas. It had been all girls since, but Naru 
had learned to be comfortable with it.

&quot;You wanna come in?&quot; she asked, seeing Makoto holding the glass door 
open (the Osaka house had a glass door that swung out and an oak door 
that swung in). The brunette smiled shyly. If anyone had told Naru that 
this young woman had been the same fearsome, independent, bullish karate 
maniac of the schoolyard, she would have laughed. Makoto was definitely 
strong but certainly not cruel. She had warmed up to young Osaka like a 
kitten would warm up to a cozy fire, perhaps instinctively since the 
girl rarely interacted with anyone else, at least on friendly terms. 
Naru began to think she was the only friend Makoto ever had, and wished 
that she would accept.

&quot;Well... you sure your mom won&#39;t mind?&quot;

&quot;Oh, she won&#39;t mind. She loves it when I bring my friends around. Of 
course, I really don&#39;t have very many people I would call a friend, 
since I&#39;m sort of shy.&quot;

&quot;And the bullies.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and because a lot of people think I&#39;m &#145;too good for them&#39;. But I 
like you. You&#39;re different.&quot; Naru blushed faintly as she realized what 
had spilled out. I like you. Of course, this was an innocent gesture of 
camaraderie, something she would probably also attribute to good music, 
or a nice movie, or a book she could never put down. Makoto had a good 
song to her voice, moved and acted comfortably, and was received with 
goodwill and cheer. She began to wonder if her brunette savior, her new 
friend, felt the same.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; replied Makoto simply, after a lengthy, awkward pause. She 
took a step and cleared her throat. &quot;Um, so... may I come in?&quot;

&quot;Uh? Ah, sure, sure!&quot; Naru led her new friend into the house, bounding 
across the large rooms and halls until she got to the kitchen. She 
yelled from inside, &quot;Do you want anything to drink or eat? I&#39;m afraid we 
don&#39;t have much of either, but I&#39;ll get you something if you want it.&quot;

&quot;Iced tea?&quot;

&quot;Coming right up!&quot; Makoto knew better than to decline an offer from a 
host (or hostess, in this case). It bridged the small gap between 
resident and visitor, it broke the ice, and it was a small, subtle act 
of friendliness. Besides, she was honestly parched. Naru found a pitcher 
of cold, strong tea from her refrigerator and poured it into a tall 
class cup. She made another glass exactly as the first, and set it down 
on the table.

&quot;Lemon, sugar?&quot;

&quot;No thanks.&quot;

&quot;Something to eat? Crackers? We have some cookies left over from a 
party.&quot;

&quot;Ooh!&quot; Naru laughed and went for the box of cookies. She laid them down 
between her space and Makoto&#39;s, and sat down with a smile. Makoto 
returned it. From the humble act of service she had witnessed, the 
brunette lady could already tell that she would like Naru. Here was a 
girl who was warm, kind, simple despite her rumored social status, 
pretty, friendly, and generous. She was by no means a snob, nor was she 
even remotely afraid of Makoto&#39;s reputation. Of course, Makoto had been 
anything but mean to her hostess, so why base something off of rumors 
when the truth was right there, smiling and chewing on chocolate chip 
cookies?

&quot;Mm! Did somebody make these?&quot;

&quot;No, store-bought,&quot; admitted Naru shyly. &quot;My mother can&#39;t cook very 
well. I can do a little. We usually buy something easy from the store 
and warm it up, or else we eat out. You&#39;d be surprised at how much a 
jewelry store owner really makes.&quot;

&quot;Not nearly as much as those guys thought,&quot; replied Kino. Osaka smiled.

&quot;Mm-hmm. So what does your mom do? And what about your father? Mine died 
a few years back.&quot; Makoto smiled gently and reached out to touch Naru&#39;s 
soft hand. The girl was so humble and self-conscious about her mother&#39;s 
job that she didn&#39;t even wear a ring or bracelet.

&quot;I know how that feels.&quot; Naru blinked.

&quot;Ya do?&quot;

&quot;Mm-hmm.&quot; A pause. Naru blinked again until she was given clarity.

&quot;Oh. And your mother?&quot;

&quot;The same.&quot; Naru&#39;s face became dark as her stomach sunk. The sweet 
cookies suddenly felt bitter in it.

&quot;Oh. Gosh, I&#39;m sorry. It must have been awful.&quot;

&quot;It still is, what with that big house I live in.&quot; Makoto&#39;s voice was 
frail and monotone, not quite quavering under grief. Naru turned her 
hand around until it clasped the one on top of it, and the two girls 
comforted each other quietly.

&quot;All by yourself?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have many friends.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Gee, I&#39;ve got to come over and cheer you up! It doesn&#39;t sound 
right, just living alone! Tell you what: I&#39;m gonna ask my mother if I 
can spend the night at your house.&quot; Makoto&#39;s face brightened like a bulb 
in a black room. She didn&#39;t really expect Naru to say something like 
that, at least not yet. She definitely liked the girl--it would be hard 
not to--but she didn&#39;t know how she felt until just now.

&quot;W-would that be inconvenient?&quot; she managed.

&quot;No! Not at all! Odds are my mother already has plans for this evening. 
All I&#39;d need to do was ask, and she&#39;d let me. She&#39;s not going to be home 
for awhile, but--&quot;

The telephone rang. Both girls laughed.

&quot;Speaking of which... hello? ...Oh, hi mother! ...Yeah, I just got home! 
I&#39;m here with a new friend from school!&quot; Naru gave Makoto a friendly 
wink while listening to her mother; Makoto became warm inwardly and 
outwardly, and could not contain the gentle, beautiful smile. The wink 
was just a harmless signal; what really made her melt was Naru&#39;s open 
declaration of friendship. There would be no doubt that Makoto would 
accept the honored position.

&quot;Well, there&#39;s not much in the cabinets or fridge, except for 
leftovers,&quot; answered Naru. &quot;...A-huh. ...Yeah. ...A-huh. ...Oh, really? 
I was just telling her that you&#39;d probably be out for the evening! 
...Well, I was wondering if it&#39;d be all right if I spent the night at 
her house. ...I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ll ask her.&quot; Naru covered the receiver 
with her hand and whispered, &quot;Can you cook? My mom is thinking about 
letting me, as long as you can make us dinner.&quot; Makoto tried to give 
Naru her humblest nod. To say that she was able to cook was like saying 
water was wet.

&quot;Yeah, she can cook,&quot; answered Naru. She and her mother traded off Yeses 
and A-huhs for awhile, then came the standard farewell, &quot;Okay mom, I&#39;ll 
see you tomorrow evening after you get home from work. I love you! 
Thanks for letting me stay over! Buh-bye!&quot; Naru hung up the phone, 
turned around, and grinned. Makoto felt like asking a stupid question.

&quot;So can you come over?&quot;

&quot;She said no!&quot; Makoto smacked herself in the face, barely able to hide 
her laughter. Naru couldn&#39;t, and chuckled as she scrambled over and 
finished off a half-eaten cookie. &quot;Of course you can, of course! Jeez, 
weren&#39;t you listening?&quot;

&quot;Only to you.&quot;

&quot;I should hope so! So when can I come over?&quot; Makoto smiled and pointed 
to the box of cookies.

&quot;Take some of those with you and we can leave right now.&quot;

----------

As it turned out, Makoto&#39;s house was just as beautiful as Naru&#39;s, though 
way too large for one person to live in. Makoto assured Naru that most 
of her spare time was not spent sulking, but rather steeped into her 
loves: cooking, cleaning, physical exercise, and of course, romancing. 
She was away from home most of the time since she had the freedom to do 
so, and having guests over was a joy she rarely experienced. She put out 
all the works for Naru as she led her new friend inside, desperately 
trying not to sound too proud as she talked about herself and her home. 
Naru, however, loved learning more about her gentle friend.

Makoto rarely experienced grief, but the loneliness was definitely 
there. Sometimes it made her physically ache, until she became weary and 
wept. Other times she resolved to be strong, for her parents, and made 
the most out of a bad situation. The inheritance and all their property 
was hers, and so far, she had shown the neighborhood that she was 
competent in handling the affairs of her parents. Makoto didn&#39;t have to 
worry about money until she came of age, since her folks apparently left 
her whatever they had stored up. She cooked all her own meals and kept 
busy cleaning house just in case a special visitor did arrive.

Naru thought the place was beautiful.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful!&quot; she exclaimed, the box of cookies still in her arms. 
Makoto smiled and showed her guest to the kitchen, which was 
surprisingly clean despite the amount of time its lone user spent in 
there. She immediately swung open cabinets and cupboards, asking what 
her guest wanted. Naru asked what was available. &quot;Just about anything 
within reason&quot; came her unhelpful answer. Naru responded with a favorite 
of hers: stuffed tortellini, scalloped potatoes, and key lime pie. 
Makoto nearly blanched at her delicate choices, but tried to promise the 
next-best thing. Naru assured her hostess that whatever she made would 
be great.

About an hour passed. Naru was entertained just from watching Makoto 
scurry around and make the dishes. She had scalloped potatoes easily, 
and to Naru&#39;s amazement, she handmade the pasta, even stuffing it with 
cheese. The pie was a problem, though, so they just substituted for the 
leftover cookies as dessert. Makoto gave Naru a sinister chuckle as she 
slyly pulled out a half-full bottle of red wine she had been storing and 
poured two small glasses. Naru vehemently refused, but her hostess 
insisted.

&quot;A little wine won&#39;t hurt you,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re both underage but it 
doesn&#39;t matter. One glass won&#39;t affect you either way. Believe me, I 
know.&quot; Naru kept her lips pursed. Frankly, she didn&#39;t want to find out 
how her generous hostess knew that. She just accepted the wine and the 
dishes, and dug in slowly. Everything was delicious.

&quot;Oh, wow, this is even better than some of the stuff I&#39;ve had at the 
restaurants!&quot; she exclaimed after swallowing. Makoto smiled humbly and 
thanked her. Naru continued to eat, trying hard not to wolf everything 
down, as she usually did. She wanted to absorb every bite that came into 
her mouth; she wanted to please her tongue with every flavor that had 
been cooked into the dishes. Makoto, gracious to the end, had given most 
of what she made to Naru while she nibbled at a smaller portion.

&quot;I&#39;ve never had this dish before, but I suppose I&#39;ve outdone myself if I 
can make something this good without ever trying it first.&quot;

&quot;You did good,&quot; complimented Naru. Makoto smiled, and little more was 
said as the two new friends continued their dinner.

Naru took control of the dishes, insisting on cleaning them to repay her 
hostess. Makoto accepted on the condition that each girl clean their own 
dish. Then, since the hour was late but nowhere near darkened into 
night, they decided on talking, getting to really know each other, 
fraternizing into the hours as many girls did. Time passed. Naru quickly 
became attracted to Makoto, but in the purest, truest sense: the girl 
was too kind and too sweet, and too giving to be unattractive.

Makoto was drawn into Naru&#39;s sweetness, her innocence (blended in with 
deepened wisdom), her beauty and taste, and her warm heart. Both girls 
loved the other woman&#39;s goodness; it was this goodness that pulled them 
in towards each other like magnets, as good things are drawn to those 
that have the senses to appreciate them.

This was no fierce karate maniac. This was no stuck-up rich snob. 
Anything but. These were girls who ached because of their loneliness, 
their exclusivity, their forced, hated isolation. They were like flowers 
in the first chilly days of spring, trapped in their own worlds by the 
icy weather, yet budded open into bloom by the appearance of the other. 
When their goodness was noticed, appreciated, even loved and admired, 
their flowers bloomed and the true beauty--indeed, the true truth came 
out, and it was a wonderful sight indeed. They didn&#39;t need to know each 
other&#39;s names; their souls spoke for them.

Two flowers, with petals of brown and red, yawned as the hour deepened 
finally, and night came over their eyes. They shared a smile.

&quot;Well, my mother did say that it would be okay if I stayed over here for 
the night,&quot; noted Naru. Makoto nodded. &quot;Do you have any extra beds I 
could sleep in? It&#39;s getting towards that time.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, but there are only two beds in this whole house. One&#39;s 
mine, and the other I can&#39;t bear to touch. I&#39;ve, uh, kept it enshrined, 
if you know what I mean.&quot; Naru did.

&quot;Oh. Yeah. Well, um, the couch looks good...&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to sleep on the couch!&quot; beamed Makoto happily. &quot;Just 
share my bed! I promise I won&#39;t kick or talk in my sleep.&quot; Naru smiled 
shyly and blushed. That wasn&#39;t exactly what had concerned her--but the 
brunette girl was a good friend, no matter how long she had been so. 
Sharing a bed would be... nice, perhaps.

&quot;Well... I suppose I could,&quot; she drawled carefully. &quot;But I can&#39;t promise 
the same!&quot;

&quot;Uh-oh, am I gonna regret that offer?&quot; laughed Makoto softly. Naru 
smiled and stood up, helping Makoto along the way.

&quot;I hope not,&quot; she murmured under her breath. The house was so quiet that 
Makoto heard it anyway, and smiled. Naru made a beeline to the bathroom 
to change into the single nightgown she had brought, while Makoto made 
the switch in her own room. She had already burrowed herself into her 
big, soft green sheets as her friend came in, flicking off the light and 
feeling her way around. Makoto could feel her bed shifting as her friend 
dug in, and smiled as she felt her scoot in close.

&quot;It&#39;s so nice and soft!&quot; she exclaimed. &quot;But it&#39;s a bit big for just one 
person. Did you have a double bed just for occasions like this?&quot; Makoto 
laughed and denied it firmly. Naru shrugged, and allowed her body to 
slump as she entered into weary sleep. Makoto watched her, and the faces 
and eyes of the girls stayed locked onto each other, just as their souls 
and hearts would always be locked, even if circumstance, good or bad, 
saw them apart. Thirty minutes passed and the drowsy caress of slumber 
came over them both.

&quot;Sleepy,&quot; whispered Makoto. Naru smiled, barely able to nudge her own 
head. Makoto&#39;s green eyes were so stunning... so beautiful, and soft, 
not like the fierce fiery eyes of a bullish thug. Naru smiled, and just 
before she drifted off totally, she reached over and caressed the pretty 
face of her friend, brushing over like a ghost--neither lingering nor 
fleeting, just long enough to feel it and know it had happened. For all 
either girl knew, though, it had been just another part of the dream 
that came over their rest.

----------

The next day came with the speed of Mercury. It was a bright, warm 
spring day, but contained within the happiness was a cruelty that all 
people face in their lives. The day began wonderfully for Makoto and 
Naru, one of them making breakfast and the other doing a small load of 
laundry. They rarely spoke during that first morning together but there 
really was no need for speech, as by some powerful link hidden in their 
hearts, they had connected to each other through a bond more powerful 
than words, and were understood simply by expressions and movements. 
They predicted it was going to be a lovely day.

Makoto walked Naru (and herself) to school--not because her friend was 
still paranoid of being attacked, but because they loved each other&#39;s 
company. Besides, the day was warm and completely liberated from 
winter&#39;s chill, so who could take transportation anyway? The girls 
walked very close together, sharing little things from time to time 
along the way. When they arrived at school, the mere sight of the 
&quot;dreaded karate freak&quot; drove most of the other students away. Naru just 
giggled.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll like having a bodyguard around.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take payment in discount jewelry,&quot; countered Makoto playfully.

School was slightly different with a new friend in tow. Besides the 
strange absence of bullies, something else bothered Makoto and Naru that 
day. During lunch, the few friends of Naru called the girl out and asked 
her how she could cavort with the &quot;dangerous&quot; Makoto Kino. Naru&#39;s pure 
anger was only matched by her kindness, and she firmly set her friends 
straight. One of Makoto&#39;s few friends also came up to her and wondered 
why the gentle girl associated with a snooty snob like Naru. The person 
was ceremoniously chewed out. Later, the girls revealed their similar 
incidents and nearly laughed at how much they really had in common.

&quot;I suppose even birds of a different feather can still sing together,&quot; 
shrugged Naru. She was off on her proverb (on purpose), but Makoto liked 
the revision. It fit them both. Somehow, she didn&#39;t see herself as being 
very different from Naru.

The rest of the school day went without incident.

While they were walking back home from school, Naru reminded her friend 
that her mother was expecting her that evening, so they would need to 
drop by the Osaka house first. Makoto liked the place. It was smaller 
and cozier than her own home, and it felt like one could really get to 
&quot;know&quot; the place, even if they lived all alone. She also wanted to meet 
Naru&#39;s mother, to see where her friend got most of her influences from. 
As it turned out, the elder Osaka lady was already home before either of 
them, and she had a message for her daughter.

Makoto instantly liked Mrs. Osaka, but not the message she had.

&quot;Thank you for letting Naru stay over at your home,&quot; said Mrs. Osaka 
politely. &quot;I didn&#39;t want her home alone, at least not without a meal. 
Sorry I had to leave you like that, sweetheart, but I had to go to a 
party.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no problem!&quot; assured her daughter. &quot;So what kind of party did you 
go to?&quot;

&quot;A going-away party.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Somebody from work?&quot;

&quot;Yes, my dear,&quot; said her mother shyly. Mrs. Osaka cleared her throat and 
placed her hands on Naru&#39;s shoulders gently, already sensing that her 
news would spoil the pure heart of her daughter. &quot;...It was for me, 
Naru. I&#39;m the one who&#39;s going away from work. I got a promotion, and I&#39;m 
moving to another part of town. I&#39;ve already filled in the relocation 
papers for your school, and we should begin packing tomorrow.&quot;

A cold pause.

&quot;...What?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry dear,&quot; she sighed. &quot;I know it&#39;s cruel of me to tear you away 
from this place, especially since you found a new friend, but...&quot;

&quot;Mother...&quot;

&quot;You must understand that when an opportunity like this comes up, we 
can&#39;t just pass it down. Sweetie, I love you, and I want the very best 
for you, and ever since your father...&quot; Mrs. Osaka trailed off. Naru 
swallowed darkly. Makoto looked crestfallen.

&quot;When do you go in for your first day?&quot;

&quot;In a week. We have to be packed and ready to leave in three days. 
Honey, I&#39;m sorry...&quot; Naru sighed wearily, but was able to look up into 
her mother&#39;s face, and even smile.

&quot;Mom, it&#39;s... all right. I... I&#39;m fine with it, really. I mean, these 
things happen, right?&quot; Her mother nodded. Naru turned around sadly to 
Makoto, giving the taller girl a heartbreaking look. Makoto desperately 
wanted to embrace her friend, to erase the sadness and have a bright, 
sunny smile in its place, but Naru did the job for her. She froze 
awkwardly as the smaller girl hugged her, right in front of her mother.

&quot;...Sorry. This just came as a surprise. I didn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;...We&#39;ll be okay,&quot; replied the brunette, slowly returning the hug. Mrs. 
Osaka smiled wistfully and wisely decided to leave the two friends 
alone. Now, Naru really turned on the sad face, nearly causing Makoto to 
do the same. Makoto tried to smile, but it was hard. It felt like a 
small piece of her own soul, one that had been grafted on so flawlessly, 
was now being ripped apart at the worst possible time. She had gained 
and lost a wonderful friend in such a short time that she could barely 
believe it had happened at all.

&quot;This is wrong,&quot; sighed Naru, still holding onto her nameless friend. 
&quot;We&#39;ve become so close in such a short period of time, and now we&#39;ll 
have to say goodbye. I feel like I know you better than anyone I&#39;ve ever 
met, and yet I don&#39;t even know your name. Ever since you saved me... 
I&#39;ve felt... happy, like there was a hole in me that had been filled up. 
Now it feels like that hole&#39;s being torn by a knife.&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help but smile at her friend&#39;s bittersweet eloquence. 
She couldn&#39;t even speak for awhile. She just leaned in, and kissed her 
forehead.

&quot;It&#39;ll be okay. We&#39;ll be okay, just like I said. I mean, we&#39;ll still 
probably be in the same town, just not so close together. Y... yeah, but 
you&#39;re right, we were close, and now we&#39;re going to be far apart. Oh, my 
dear friend, the angelic girl whose name I don&#39;t know, you&#39;ve saved me 
more than I could ever save you. You&#39;re my little guardian angel, you 
know? I was just so sad... so sad and lonely, and bitter at so many 
things, before this sweet redhead stumbled into my life. I might have 
saved you from a beating, but you saved me from so many other storms. 
You were--are--a ray of sunshine in my life, a sign that... all the 
storms are now over, and spring has come out again.&quot;

Now it was Naru&#39;s turn to smile at Makoto&#39;s eloquence. She giggled 
sadly.

&quot;I... I guess we still have three days to spend with each other,&quot; she 
managed. &quot;I don&#39;t want to sound morbid, but maybe you can help us move. 
I know it will sound weird if you think about it, but at least we&#39;ll 
have some time with each other. And then...&quot; Naru trailed off, shaking 
her head slowly since she didn&#39;t have an answer. Makoto smiled and gave 
her friend a tight hug. When Naru embraced even tighter, Makoto was 
amazed at how desperate and powerful the girl was. She really was her 
emotional savior.

&quot;I&#39;ll help you pack,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;And then I&#39;ll make you a lunch 
when it&#39;s time for you to go. We&#39;ll see each other again. Just like the 
song goes, it&#39;s a small world after all.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; groaned Naru, her voice jittery from a mixture of laughter and 
sadness, &quot;anything but that.&quot;

---------------

Three days passed.

When Naru Osaka and her mother were ready to leave, Makoto Kino was 
there, bearing three gifts for her friend. One was the promised lunch: 
Naru&#39;s favorite, even an entire key lime pie, bought fresh from the 
store (Makoto promised to master the recipe for the treat). Another was 
a simple post-it note, with ten digits scrawled on it in permanent ink. 
Naru smiled as she recognized it to be her friend&#39;s phone number.

&quot;Call me once you get there so I can have yours,&quot; said Makoto with a 
wink. Naru promised with a nod. Finally, Makoto gave Naru one last 
present, unfastening one of her rose earrings from her ear and giving it 
to her friend. Naru gasped as it came into her possession.

&quot;I can&#39;t take this! It&#39;s yours! Besides, don&#39;t you need both?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ours now,&quot; said Makoto with another wink. &quot;If you wear it, you can 
think of me. Maybe it will give you special powers or let you see me in 
your dreams.&quot; Naru chuckled with disbelief and stared at the rose jewel 
for a long time, appraising its priceless value. The daughter of a 
jewelry store owner, she had gotten her ears pierced ages ago, and 
replaced one of her humble emerald pins with the larger rose.

&quot;I guess you can have this in exchange,&quot; said Naru bashfully as she 
handed the girl the small green pin. Makoto took it carefully and 
applied it with great love. Both girls looked a little weird with 
earrings that didn&#39;t match, but they didn&#39;t care. The deep significance 
of sharing such treasures was greater than appearance.

&quot;Oh, one more thing,&quot; said Naru hastily, digging inside her pocket. She 
produced a pink band with green baubles, and gave it to Makoto. &quot;Maybe 
you can put it in your hair. I think you&#39;d look cute with a ponytail!&quot; 
Makoto smiled warmly, and tied her loose, free flowing chocolate hair 
into the bow. As she got a glimpse of herself in Mrs. Osaka&#39;s car 
mirror, she admitted that Naru was right.

&quot;Naa-ruu!&quot; shouted Mrs. Osaka from the now-empty house. She carried two 
suitcases in her hands yet still managed to wave at her daughter. &quot;It&#39;s 
time to leave, honey. Oh, um, are you almost ready?&quot; Naru turned around, 
smiling at her mother in the most innocent, carefree way. She was still 
pretty sad to leave a good friend, but she knew the parting would not be 
forever. Somehow, those two were destined to see each other again, even 
if it was under strange terms; their very souls ordained it.

&quot;Yeah, just about,&quot; she replied. Mother nodded and threw the bags in the 
trunk, and started the car. Naru looked back, up into Makoto&#39;s stunning 
green eyes, remembering their first and best night together, and how 
alive it had been. Here, she was about to start something new, with the 
chance to make a new life for herself and find new friends, friends who 
didn&#39;t bully or intimidate her simply because of where her mother 
worked. She had to admit that in spite of briefly losing Makoto, it 
sounded pretty exciting.

&quot;Well...&quot; began the brunette, her hair in a cute tail thanks to her 
friend. Naru smiled and put her finger to the girl&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Long farewells were never necessary. Let&#39;s just promise to keep in 
touch, kay? We don&#39;t know each other&#39;s names, but we&#39;ll know each other 
again when we meet. How could we mistake it?&quot; Naru fell into the embrace 
of her friend, rubbed her back, then let her go. The girls bowed 
simultaneously, and parted down two paths. Before Naru vanished inside 
the car that would take her away into a new life, she blew Makoto a 
kiss. Makoto blew one at the exact same time.

One year later, the defender of the weak, unfortunate, and helpless was 
expelled from her school for fighting. Embittered by the extreme 
injustice wrought upon her, she wandered until she found a school that 
would accept her. It was by scholastic merit alone that she was able to 
continue her education at all. By that time, though, Makoto L. Kino had 
reverted to her isolated, cold, lonely self again, having spent too long 
a time away from any semblance of love. But unbeknownst to her, fate had 
a kinder hand in store for her.

And when Makoto gave it some thought, she was glad she had kept true to 
her Self and &quot;started&quot; those fights. Aside from Shinozaki and that one 
beautiful stranger she had met so many ages ago, the transfer was the 
best thing that had ever happened to her.

And true to her friend&#39;s word, when she saw the beautiful girl who had 
saved her from her own emotional storms, talking and sitting quietly 
with new friends, she was able to recognize her instantly. Makoto was 
able to find a private time to make her presence known, and squealed as 
she greeted her dear, great friend. The meeting was marked by an embrace 
that had been too long in coming, and little more save wordless 
expressions given by sparkling eyes of blue and green. Makoto giggled 
and shyly held out her hand.

&quot;By the way,&quot; she managed, &quot;before I totally forget, my name&#39;s Makoto 
Kino.&quot; Naru grinned and shook her hand.

&quot;And my name&#39;s Naru Osaka. It&#39;s a pleasure to finally meet you, Makoto.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good to meet you as well, Naru.&quot;

Their names rolled off their tongues like honey.</pre>
