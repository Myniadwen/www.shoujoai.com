The Science Project; Deep Feelings Emerge 

&#147;Lucky you, Taiki!&#148; Seiya teased. &#147;I don&#146;t mind having Mizuno-san as a 
partner, but&#133;&#148; 

&#147;But you know you can&#146;t fuck her in a library!&#148; Yaten finished. Seiya 
high-fived her. &#147;That&#146;s NOT what I was going to say!&#148; Taiki said. The 
two other lights continued laughing, &#147;I wouldn&#146;t be laughing if I were 
you Yaten since I wouldn&#146;t be the one fucking a cat.&#148; Taiki whispered 
to her. Yaten stopped laughing immediately, &#147;Who told you!?&#148; she 
asked. &#147;You think Aino-chan would keep something that good to 
herself!?&#148; Taiki asked. They were at the library getting information 
on their projects and Seiya continued laughing. The librarian had 
shushed her multiple times, but it didn&#146;t work. 

&#147;I&#146;m going to kill Mina-chan when I see her!&#148; Yaten said. &#147;That&#146;s 
something I&#146;d like to see!&#148; Seiya said. Then Taiki stood up and headed 
for the computers, &#147;Where ya goin&#146;?&#148; Seiya asked. &#147;Some where far away 
from you two!&#148; Taiki answered in a cold voice. As she approached the 
computers she noticed Ami at one with Usagi standing above her. &#147;I 
hate projects especially science ones.&#148; Usagi said. &#147;You always say 
that Usagi-chan! Besides learning can be fun.&#148; Ami said. &#147;She&#146;s right 
Tuskino-san.&#148; Taiki said standing on the opposite side of Ami. Ami 
blush slightly, &#147;Hi Taiki-san!&#148; Usagi said cheerfully, &#147;So I hear you 
and Ami-chan are partners.&#148; 

&#147;That&#146;s right. Anyway have you picked up on any good information 
Mizuno-san?&#148; 

&#147;Not really. I can&#146;t decide on what planet we should do.&#148; Ami 
answered. &#147;I know Mercury!&#148; Usagi suggested. Ami smiled at her 
suggestion, &#147;What a great idea Usagi-chan.&#148; she said, &#147;Taiki-san?&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t have a problem with it.&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m so smart!&#148; Usagi said. 

After about four hours on the computer Ami and Taiki found the 
information that they needed. &#147;Mizuno-san I don&#146;t know how you people 
of Mercury survived there.&#148; Taiki said taking a seat across from her. 
&#147;Well it was a thousand years ago Taiki-san. It wasn&#146;t THAT hot 
there.&#148; Ami said. &#147;I duno. I believe it&#146;s always been 400C there. And 
&#150; 150C at night.&#148; Taiki said. &#147;You seem to think you know a lot about 
things you don&#146;t know.&#148; Ami said. Taiki gave Ami an &#145;I really don&#146;t 
feel like fighting with you&#146; look. &#147;We have a report due in a few 
weeks and I don&#146;t feel like arguing with you about it.&#148; Taiki said 
calmly. &#147;Fine I&#146;ll drop it.&#148; Ami said. &#147;Fine.&#148; 

&#147;Fine.&#148; 

&#147;Are you missing it?&#148; 

&#147;Missing what your talking?&#148; 

&#147;NO! Kinmoku.&#148; 

&#147;Why?&#148; Taiki asked. &#147;Because it&#146;s your home.&#148; Ami answered. &#147;I thought 
you were going to stop talking.&#148; Ami started to get angry, &#147;See that&#146;s 
why we always end up fighting. Because every time I try to get close 
to you or know more about you, you always push me away!&#148; she said, 
&#147;Why Taiki-san!?&#148; 

&#147;Why what?&#148; 

&#147;Why do you keep your feelings all bottled up!? Is it me?&#148; 

&#147;No, it&#146;s not you Mizuno-san.&#148; 

&#147;Then what is it?&#148; Taiki didn&#146;t answer. Ami decided to give up. She 
didn&#146;t want to, but she just wasn&#146;t getting through to her. Ami got up 
from her seat and headed for the door. Taiki got up too and jumped in 
front of Ami before she opened the door. &#147;Mizuno-san I&#146;m sorry. It&#146;s 
not you it&#146;s me. It&#146;s just that I have trouble expressing my 
feelings&#133;and some times -- well most of the time I end up lashing out 
at people.&#148; Taiki confessed. She then took Ami&#146;s hand into her own, &#147;I 
don&#146;t want to loose you Mizuno-san. I care about you a lot&#133;and I&#146;m 
very sorry if me being an ass has hurt you in anyway.&#148; 

With that said Ami hugged her tight, &#147;See that wasn&#146;t so hard now was 
it? I care about you too Taiki-san.&#148; she said. Ami brought the taller 
girl&#146;s face towards her&#146;s until their lips locked in a long passionate 
kiss. Taiki broke away suddenly taking in breath. &#147;You&#146;ve never been 
kissed before have you?&#148; Ami asked. &#147;No.&#148; 

&#147;I think you&#146;re supposed to breath through your nose or something.&#148; 
Ami said unsure. &#147;Oh yeah&#133;it&#146;s just that I&#146;m sort of new at this.&#148; 
Taiki said shyly. &#147;That makes two of us.&#148; With that said they kissed 
again the science project forgotten. 

[CM] 

&#147;Are you sure we weren&#146;t too hard on her?&#148; Seiya asked Yaten over the 
phone. &#147;Well it&#146;s like they say the truth hurts.&#148; Yaten answered. 
&#147;Yeah, but&#133;&#148; 

&#147;I still believe in what I said. Until she can learn not to lash out 
at people and show her true feelings Taiki will always have the title 
as the Ice Queen.&#148; 

&#147;I still think we should say sorry&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Fine, since I don&#146;t like it when you&#146;re upset we&#146;ll do it&#133; But the 
library&#146;s closed by now.&#148; 

&#147;Well where could she be?&#148; 

&#147;Do you really want to?&#148; Ami asked. &#147;Do you?&#148; Taiki asked nervous. 
&#147;Might as well since I&#146;m already on top of you.&#148; Ami kissed her again 
with more passion. She beckoned Taiki up so that she was sitting in 
her lap as her lips caressed her neck. Taiki soon found her hands 
moving under Ami&#146;s shirt and lift it over her head. Her lover&#146;s kisses 
begin traveling downward as she unzipped her shirt and bra. 
&#147;Mizuno-san&#133;&#148; Taiki moaned when she felt her lips on her bare breast. 
&#147;You&#146;re very beautiful.&#148; Ami said as her lips traveled back towards 
Taiki&#146;s lips. During their kiss Ami pushed her back down onto the 
table removing her pants feeling they no longer needed a purpose. When 
both of their clothing was removed Ami moved downward again leaving a 
trail of kisses until she reached her most sensitive area. 

&#147;I called Ami&#146;s house about four times, but there&#146;s still no answer.&#148; 
Usagi said to Makoto over the phone. &#147;Where could those two be?&#148; 
Makoto asked. &#147;I duno, Seiya called Taiki&#146;s cell phone a few minutes 
ago with no answer either.&#148; 

&#147;Well&#133; Maybe she turned it off.&#148; 

&#147;Why would Taiki-san do that?&#148; 

&#147;Maybe she doesn&#146;t want to be bothered.&#148; 

&#147;Maybe&#133;&#148; 

&#147;Well if I see either of them I&#146;ll make sure that they call you ok 
Usagi-chan?&#148; 

&#147;Ok. Ja Ne Mako-chan.&#148; 

&#147;Ja ne Usagi-chan.&#148; 

When Usagi hung up she turned to Seiya, &#147;You wanna try her cell phone 
again?&#148; she asked. 

&#147;Ohhh Ami-chan.&#148; Taiki moaned as she felt Ami&#146;s tongue inside her. Ami 
raised her head up, &#147;You like that don&#146;t you?&#148; she asked already 
knowing the answer. &#147;Yes Ami-chan. Please&#133; don&#146;t stop.&#148; Ami then 
shifted her body so she could give and receive pleasure. Ami gently 
caresses her womanhood without entering it. Taiki did the same to her 
only using her lips before she began licking her clit. &#147;Ohhh 
Taiki-san! That feels so good!&#148; 

&#147;Maybe,&#148; Yaten began, &#147;maybe she doesn&#146;t want to be contacted.&#148; 

&#147;Yaten-chan!&#148; Minako exclaimed and pushed her off the bed. &#147;Ok I take 
it back. Maybe they&#146;re doing something &#145;privet&#146; and don&#146;t wanna be 
bothered.&#148; 

&#147;You have a dirty mind Yaten-chan.&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;s a fact of life Mina-chan. Get use to it.&#148; 

&#147;But they&#146;re GIRLS!&#148; 

&#147;So. Gender and age doesn&#146;t matter when it comes to love. Take Seiya 
and Usagi-chan for example.&#148; 

&#147;What about us?&#148; 

&#147;What ABOUT us?&#148; 

&#147;You love me right Yaten-chan?&#148; Yaten didn&#146;t have to think twice about 
the question, &#147;Maybe.&#148; She answered with a sly grin. 

&#147;Ok, so how do I, or should I say WE do this?&#148; Ami asked facing Taiki 
again. &#147;I think you&#146;re supposed to grind up and down rubbing both of 
our clits off at the same time.&#148; 

&#147;Oh ok&#133; Clit? What&#146;s a clit?&#148; 

&#147;Clitoris Ami-chan.&#148; 

&#147;Oh yeah I remember reading about it in a biology book in science 
class. It&#146;s said to be the most erogenous part of the female body.&#148; 

&#147;Ami-chan only you could bring up study at a time like this. But 
that&#146;s why I love you.&#148; 

&#147;Aww, I love you to.&#148; Ami said and started grinding up and down, &#147;Like 
this?&#148; 

&#147;Yeah&#133; Ohhh, but whatever you do don&#146;t stop.&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t plan to.&#148; Ami leaned forward and kissed her, &#147;Taiki-san--&#148; 

&#147;Ami-chan I don&#146;t think there&#146;s a need to be so formal.&#148; 

&#147;Ok Kou-chan! Ne, Kou-chan you know what?&#148; 

&#147;What?&#148; 

&#147;This seems SO wrong. I mean making love in a library, but it feels so 
right. Hey, how long have you been in love with me?&#148; 

&#147;To tell the truth, I loved you from day one. But I was to full of 
myself to tell you. My feelings for you grew stronger as you started 
showing me things. But I never thought this would be happening. I love 
your shine Ami-chan. You have a very beautiful shine.&#148; 

&#147;Do you really mean that?&#148; 

&#147;Yes. You&#146;re so beautiful Ami-chan. It&#146;s a wonder why you don&#146;t have a 
boyfriend.&#148; 

&#147;You&#146;re the first person that I ever had feelings for who has said 
that. Until now I never&#133; Oh Dear God!&#148; 

&#147;Are you cuming?&#148; 

&#147;Yeah&#133; OHHHH!&#148; Taiki sat up, &#147;Ok, don&#146;t stop, just use the rest of 
your vagina and...&#148; she was cut off by the sounds of her own orgasm 
coming. Ami began grinding faster and harder as the two senshi started 
playing with each other&#146;s breast. &#147;Oh Ami-chan! Keep it up!&#148; 

&#147;AH Kou-chan! OHHHH this is gonna be one hell of an orgasm! What do I 
do now?&#148; 

&#147;ANYTHING!&#148; 

&#147;Ok then.&#148; Ami said and pushed herself deeper inside Taiki, their 
clits practically being smashed together. &#147;You like that?&#148; 

&#147;YES!&#148; Both girls came together screaming out each other&#146;s name. Taiki 
had a massive orgasm and collapsed onto the table with Ami lying on 
top of her out of breath. &#147;OH God Ami-chan (gasps) that was SO good!&#148; 
Ami snuggled against her, &#147;I guess what they say is true. The longer 
you have to wait the better it is.&#148; Then she heard her lover chuckle a 
bit, &#147;What&#146;s so funny?&#148; 

&#147;I was just thinking about what the librarian is going to think when 
she finds cum on her table.&#148; 

&#147;Speaking of which we should be heading home. Your cell phone&#146;s been 
ringing like crazy!&#148; 

&#147;It&#146;s probably just Seiya.&#148; 

When the two reached the Mizuno household there were at lest 18 
messages on the answer machine. &#147;Let me guess, Tsukino-san, Kino-san, 
Aino-san, Seiya, and Yaten all called?&#148; Taiki asked. &#147;Who else would 
it be Kou-chan?&#148; 

&#147;Your mother?&#148; Then the phone rang, &#147;Moshi moshi&#133; Hi Usagi-chan&#133; Yeah 
we just got back&#133; We were &#145;working&#146; on our project. She had the phone 
turned off&#133; Ok, ok she didn&#146;t turn it off we just didn&#146;t want to be 
bothered. No, no Usagi-chan it&#146;s not that we didn&#146;t&#133; Usagi-chan please 
stop crying. Ok I&#146;ll tell Taiki-san to answer her phone more often&#133; 
Why didn&#146;t I answer my communicator? Uh&#133; Gomen nasi Usagi-chan, but I 
have to go see you tomorrow!&#148; Ami quickly hung up. 

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; 

&#147;Usagi-chan wanted to know why I didn&#146;t answer my communicator and why 
she heard sounds in the background.&#148; Ami then noticed that Taiki was 
blushing, &#147;But she doesn&#146;t have to know that it was us or anything for 
that matter.&#148; she kissed her, &#147;But first thing&#146;s first. Let&#146;s shower 
then let everyone know that we&#146;re ok if Usagi-chan hasn&#146;t already.&#148; 

&#147;Or&#133; we could take a shower and go to bed with pleasure in between. 
And we could call them tomorrow.&#148; 

&#147;That&#146;s even better, but YOU better be the one giving the pleasure 
since it was YOUR idea.&#148; 

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way.&#148; </pre>
