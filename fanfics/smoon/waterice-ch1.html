<h1>Water and Ice</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/cspluto.html">Celestial Sailor Pluto</a><br> </h2>
<pre>AN: If you don&#146;t want to read this story, there is a back button. If 
you wish to flame, at least explain why so I can improve. If you want a 
sequel to this, tell me and I&#146;ll try my best.

P.S. Michiru and Haruka are cousins in this, just so neither has a 
broken heart.

P.P.S. After S, but the Outers never left.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

	Michiru lazily swam around her indoor pool while she waited for 
the younger girl to finish changing for their race. Ami had shyly 
approached Michiru not fifteen minutes earlier to ask if they could 
have anther race. Being that no matter how hard Michiru tried, she 
could not have said no if she wanted to, Michiru had agreed.

	At the sound of the door to the indoor pool opening, Michiru 
looked up, to be met by the sight of her beautiful water-nymph in a 
blue bikini. Michiru tried not to stare as Ami gracefully dived into 
the pool. She silently thanked the gods for Ami not noticing that she 
was being gawked at.

	Once they were both situated for the race, Ami counted to three, 
and both took off. The objective of the race was to swim ten laps, back 
and forth across the pool, and come in first place. The prize was that 
the winner could have one wish granted if it was in the loser&#146;s power 
to do so. Both were desperate to win. Neither even thought about giving 
up. They were neck to neck for the first seven laps, before Michiru 
pulled ahead. By the end of the tenth lap, Michiru was three feet ahead 
of Ami, and had thus won the race.

	Ami climbed up out of the pool after Michiru, and asked her, 
&#147;so&#133;what&#146;s your wish?&#148;

	Michiru walked right in front of Ami, and gently put her finger 
under Ami&#146;s chin. She tilted Ami&#146;s head so they were looking right at 
each other, as Michiru whispered, &#147;this&#148;. With that said, Michiru 
gently kissed Ami. Both saw fireworks from that small kiss. As they 
pulled apart, Ami, in a small douse of courage said, in just above a 
whisper, &#147;I love you Michiru&#148;. 

	Michiru gently pulled the smaller girl closer and whispered, &#147;I 
love you too Ami. And I&#146;m very glad you suggested this race. So tell 
me, what was your wish going to be if you had won?&#148;

	Ami blushed lightly and looked Michiru in the eyes, before she 
gently kissed Michiru. When they pulled apart, Ami whispered, &#147;That&#148;.
