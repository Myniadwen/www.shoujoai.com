<h1>In the Sun (part 10 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/literalmeta.html">Literal Metaphor</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/inthesun-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>      Makoto looked around, wondering why the park seemed 
deserted in the middle of an afternoon.  She looked up at 
the suddenly gray sky just as a drop of water hit her 
forehead.  With a sigh she moved from the bench she had 
been occupying to a nearby gazebo.  Once underneath she 
nearly laughed at the irony, waiting for Freddy to arrive 
so she could break up with him, now in the exact same place 
he dumped her seemingly ages ago.
	&quot;Babe!&quot;  She cringed as she heard his voice from 
behind her.  Turning around slowly she saw him running 
towards her, using a newspaper as a shield from the 
increasing rain.  
	He shook his shaggy locks, spraying drops of water on 
her.  
	&quot;Freddy!&quot;
	&quot;Oh, sorry Babe.  Not my fault, you&#39;re the one who 
wanted to meet out here.  Didn&#39;t you watch the forecast 
today? Never mind, we have a bigger problem.&quot;
	Makoto crossed her arms.  She was starting to feel 
less guilty about dumping him.  &quot;What&#39;s the problem &#39;we&#39; 
have?&quot;
	&quot;I went home today and all my stuff was in the 
hallway!  It&#39;s like reverse burglary or something!&quot;
	&quot;Well, that seems to be more your problem than mine.&quot;
	He squinted at her, brushing wet hair away from his 
eyes.  &quot;What&#39;s up with you?  That time of the month or 
something?&quot;
	Makoto&#39;s hands flexed at her sides, curbing her first 
instinct of slugging him on the jaw.  &quot;No,&quot; She replied 
patiently, &quot;But you were right before, we do have a 
problem.  Freddy, listen...&quot; She paused, searching for the 
right words.  Not finding them, nor caring, she settled for 
the simplest.  &quot;You have to move out.  I can&#39;t be with you 
anymore.&quot;  
	It was a few seconds before he fully comprehended what 
she had said.  &quot;Are you-are you kidding? &#39;Cause it&#39;s not 
funny.&quot;
	&quot;It isn&#39;t&quot;, Makoto shook her head, &quot;But I&#39;m not 
kidding.&quot;
	A hand came up to run through his uncombed hair as he 
paced around.  Makoto waited.
	&quot;Why?&quot; He finally said, &quot;I thought we had something 
good Makoto!  Is this because I forgot to pay my half of 
the rent last month?&quot;
	&quot;I just can&#39;t be with you anymore.&quot; She sighed, 
looking away from his hurt face.  &quot;Sorry.&quot;
	Freddy&#39;s shoulders drooped, staring into the back of 
her head with wide eyes.  &quot;Makoto...&quot;
	She frowned hearing him begin to whimper.  &quot;Come on 
Freddy, don&#39;t make this bad.  I don&#39;t want to turn around 
and see you crying.&quot;
	&quot;Too bad!&quot; He shouted, wiping his eyes with his jacket 
sleeve.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand what happened to you.  You 
said you wanted to be with me, what happened?&quot;
	Reluctantly, Makoto faced him.  &quot;Things change,&quot; She 
said weakly, contemplating revealing the entire truth to 
him.  She shook her head; he was already in a pitiful 
state.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s how it is.&quot;
	&quot;Is it another dude?  &#39;Cause that&#39;s real foul, 
Makoto.&quot;
	Makoto swallowed, &quot;I can tell you with the utmost 
sincerity, that it is not &#39;another dude&#39;.&quot;
	&quot;Then what the fuck is it?  You can&#39;t do this to me!&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re taking this way too hard.&quot;
	&quot;How the fuck am I supposed to take it?&quot;
	&quot;Try thinking about how you dumped me, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll 
be inspired.&quot;  Makoto responded cuttingly to his sudden 
anger.
	He replied with a frustrated yell, kicking at the 
gazebo floor with his sneaker toe.  &quot;What is this?  What, 
are you trying to get revenge for something that happened 
years ago, you crazy bitch?&quot;
	&quot;No.&quot;  Makoto&#39;s voice was hard; she had reached her 
tolerance limit for her once again &#39;old sempai&#39;.  &quot;Revenge 
would be telling you that I&#39;ve been cheating on you with 
Ami for almost as long as I&#39;ve been with you.&quot;
	The expression change on Freddy&#39;s face was curious.  
&quot;Ami?  Little blue-haired chick?&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s her.&quot;  Makoto crossed her arms, wondering what 
was going through his head.  She was mildly surprised when 
he began to smile, a sleazy half smirk.  Again she 
restrained herself from knocking his teeth out.  &quot;You&#39;re a 
sick human being, Freddy.  And I&#39;ll be glad if I don&#39;t see 
you again for the rest of my life.&quot;  
	She left him standing on the gazebo, not bothering to 
shield herself from the downpour.  
	&quot;You&#39;re soaked,&quot; Were Ami&#39;s words upon opening her 
apartment door and finding Makoto dripping in front of her.
	Makoto grinned, &quot;No, I&#39;m free.&quot;  Unable to control 
herself she threw her arms around Ami, lifting her off the 
ground and squealing ecstatically into her neck.
	&quot;Makoto!  Makoto, please put me down!&quot;  Ami pleaded in 
a low voice.
	&quot;I can&#39;t.  I&#39;m too happy.&quot;
	&quot;My mother&#39;s home.&quot;
	Ami found the floor beneath her feet once again.  Her 
mother&#39;s voice beckoned her from inside.  &quot;Yes, mother.  
Come in, you&#39;ll need to change your clothes.&quot;  
	Makoto hesitated as Ami took her hand to lead her in.  
&quot;I don&#39;t know how I feel about getting naked while your 
mother&#39;s home.&quot;
	Ami smiled despite herself.  &quot;When I said &#39;change&#39;, I 
meant &#39;change&#39;.  Nothing else.&quot;
	&quot;You didn&#39;t... tell your mother... anything... did you?&quot;  
Makoto asked cautiously.
	&quot;Oh Kami no!&quot;  Ami answered surprisingly quickly.  
&quot;There was so much trouble with Freddy, and Usagi and 
everything else...  You wouldn&#39;t mind if my mother was in the 
dark for a bit, would you?&quot;
	Makoto sighed in utter relief.  &quot;Not at all.  We 
deserve an intermission before more drama.&quot;
	Ami only laughed, pulling her inside.

	Rei watched as Minako&#39;s breath came back to her, her 
chest rising and falling as she panted quietly, eyes 
closed.  Limbs still trembling, Rei turned from her back 
onto her side, reaching out to touch the blonde.  Rei 
smiled at her as her blue eyes came open.  The smile 
faltered as Minako ignored it, rising slowly and drawing 
her knees to her chest.  
	&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; She asked immediately.   
	&quot;Nothing,&quot; Minako hastened to assure her, meeting her 
eyes for a second before turning away again, &quot;I just 
haven&#39;t done that in a while, that&#39;s all.&quot;
	Rei relaxed, &quot;Oh.&quot;  She lay back down, folding her 
hands behind her head.  &quot;It sure didn&#39;t feel like it,&quot; She 
chuckled, but brought no response from Minako.  The blonde 
only threw the covers aside, getting up and finding her 
randomly strewn clothing.
	&quot;Where are you going?&quot;
	Minako glanced at her briefly, hesitating.  &quot;Home,&quot; 
She said quietly, slipping her shirt over head.
	Rei sprung out of bed, wrapping the sheets around her 
nude form.  &quot;Why?  Stay a little.  We should,&quot; She paused, 
watching Minako deliberately pull her socks on, &quot;talk about 
this.  About us.&quot;
	The blonde continued dressing, flashing her cloudy 
eyes over Rei.  &quot;I have to get home.  I didn&#39;t mean to... 
stay.  My parents will be wondering.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s five in the afternoon! And it&#39;s raining.&quot; Rei 
pleaded, not understanding her at the moment.  Minako had 
come to her house wanting to talk, but kissed her instead, 
setting off the intense physical reunion that Rei now 
needed to validate with an explanation.  Minako however, 
was not prepared to give one.  
	&quot;Sorry, but I have to.&quot; She ran her fingers through 
her hair and straightened her mussed bow, heading for the 
bedroom door.
	Rei hurried to follow her, wrapping the sheets around 
her nude body.  &quot;Hey,&quot; She grabbed her arm in desperation, 
but let it go immediately after Minako&#39;s alarmed reaction, 
&quot;Sorry.  But... don&#39;t you have anything to say about what 
just happened?&quot;
	&quot;Is it really necessary to say anything?&quot;
	&quot;Yes!&quot; Rei shouted, becoming frustrated.  She 
swallowed, &quot;You didn&#39;t say if you forgive me or not.&quot;
	Minako looked at her, eyebrows furrowed.  Her sudden 
frown made Rei wince.  &quot;I have to go.&quot;
	She was ten steps away before Rei could say anything 
else.  Suddenly drained and listless, the miko slumped back 
to her bedroom, passing her confused grandfather and a 
slack-jawed Yuuichiro.  
	&quot;Eh, Rei my child,&quot; Her grandfather began uneasily, 
&quot;How did-did you two-eh-&quot;
	The miko rubbed her eyes, screaming, &quot;Why is she doing 
this to me?!&quot;  
	They recoiled at her rage as she left them in the 
hallway, her bedroom door slamming shut behind her.

	The customary walk to school in the morning proved an 
interesting one to Usagi, looking on with a pleased smile 
at Makoto and Ami&#39;s simple and subtle display of affection.  
She hung back with Minako as the other two walked in front, 
arms linked.  
	&quot;Hey Mina-chan, what do you think of that?&quot; Usagi 
pointed with her chin at their friends.  
	Minako looked up, distractedly.  She shrugged, &quot;What&#39;s 
there to think?  It&#39;s just Ami-chan and Mako-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Are you telling me you don&#39;t see it?  They&#39;re so 
together!&quot; The odangoed blonde whispered excitedly.  &quot;I 
wonder why they haven&#39;t said anything yet.&quot;
	&quot;As if they would.  Usagi-chan, I need to tell-&quot; 
Minako stopped as Ami and Makoto greeted Rei as she joined 
them.
	&quot;Hey Rei-chan!&quot; Usagi waved, surprised to see her 
after having abandoned the walk for the past few weeks.  
Excited as she was, she remained unaware of Minako 
stiffening next to her.
	&quot;Hey,&quot; Rei replied quietly, eyes only on Minako.  To 
her though she said nothing, only resuming the walk beside 
Ami.
	Usagi noticed the obvious uneasiness between the two.  
Again she hung back with Minako, whispering, &quot;Ami told me 
you were going to talk to Rei.&quot;
	Minako swallowed, a sudden lump in her throat.  &quot;I 
did.  And... Usagi, I&#39;m the dumbest person in the entire 
universe.&quot;
  	&quot;I don&#39;t understand.  What happened, Mina-chan?&quot;  
Usagi&#39;s blue eyes widened with concern, but there was no 
time for a reply as the group arrived at TA, Rei&#39;s stop.
	Makoto rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly, not 
knowing what to say to Rei after so many weeks of disquiet 
and divergence.  &quot;So... should we stop back this afternoon?&quot;
	Makoto&#39;s effort was received with a small, but 
grateful smile.  &quot;Sure,&quot; Her eyes wandered to Minako, who 
was trying to look everywhere but at her.  &quot;Um... I&#39;m having 
some trouble with physics; maybe we can have a meeting at 
the shrine?&quot;
	&quot;Of course,&quot; Ami piped immediately.  
	Makoto too nodded.  &quot;Sure, Rei-chan.  I&#39;ll bring 
brownies.&quot;
	Rei coughed, noticing that neither Usagi nor Minako 
had said anything yet.  &quot;Everyone can come...&quot;
	Usagi&#39;s concern for Minako subsided momentarily, 
realizing that Rei was talking about them.  &quot;I&#39;ll 
definitely be there.  So will Mina-chan.&quot;  
	Minako looked up only to give Usagi a betrayed look.  
Her eyes glimpsed Rei&#39;s intense face for a second before 
finding the ground once again.
	&quot;Okay then.  See you guys later.&quot;  Not once did Rei&#39;s 
penetrating eyes leave the blonde until she finally turned 
to enter TA.  
	The remaining four stood for a few moments.  Makoto 
looked at Minako, remembering what she had asked her to do 
the day before.  Tired of the silence she said 
impertinently, &quot;That was more awkward than it probably 
should&#39;ve been.  Anyway, let&#39;s not stand around here all 
day; we&#39;re going to be late.&quot;
	Unaware of how to reply to that Minako and the other 
two simply followed her silently the rest of the way.

	&quot;Shit,&quot; Minako didn&#39;t bother to conceal her 
disappointment as Amagasaki-sensei handed a test back to 
her with a constipated frown.  
	&quot;It looks like propriety along with algebra aren&#39;t 
your strong points, Aino.&quot; He told her, missing her eyes 
roll as he handed Ami&#39;s perfect scoring test back to her, 
&quot;Get some help for the next one.  You too, Tsukino.&quot;
	Usagi frowned at her 47.  &quot;It&#39;s a good thing we&#39;re 
having a study meeting today, right Mina-chan?  What&#39;d you 
get?&quot;
	&quot;Not even double-digits,&quot; She shoved the paper into 
her bag embarrassedly.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry Mina-chan, we&#39;ll sort it all out this 
afternoon,&quot; Ami gave her a sympathetic smile, but it soon 
disappeared as Minako stiffened and avoided facing her.  
&quot;You will come, won&#39;t you Mina-chan?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami-chan.  I&#39;m not up for it right now.&quot;
	Ami became concerned, more for Rei&#39;s feelings than 
anything else.  She could see how much the miko wanted to 
see Minako, anyone could see it.  &quot;Please reconsider Mina-
chan. Rei-chan really wants you to be there.  I thought you 
two were talking again anyway, you told Mako-chan and I you 
would give her a chance.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, you never finished explaining that,&quot; Usagi 
reminded her.   &quot;Did you talk to her or not?&quot;
	Minako looked at the ceiling so she wouldn&#39;t have to 
see their reactions to what she was about to tell them, &quot;I... 
We did a little more than talk.  Much more.  Too much.&quot;  
	Ami put a shocked hand to her mouth while Usagi 
gasped, then squealed in delight.  &quot;You&#39;re back together?!&quot; 
She threw her arms around Minako&#39;s neck, almost knocking 
her over and drawing the attention of the rest of the 
class.
	&quot;Knock that off!&quot; Amagasaki-sensei roared.
	Usagi returned to her own seat, but still grinned.  
Minako however put her face in her hands, sighing heavily.
	&quot;I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami said, 
looking at the blonde carefully.   
	&quot;You&#39;re not back together?&quot; She asked, disappointed.
	Minako rubbed her temples, becoming fatigued.  &quot;No.&quot;
	&quot;Then why did you...&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t know!&quot;
	Once again the eyes of the entire class were on 
Minako, disrupting the quiet with her outburst.
	She sunk into her chair, &quot;Sorry Sensei.&quot;  Clearing her 
throat she attempted to explain herself to Usagi and Ami, 
&quot;I went over there to talk, and it was awful.  But then she 
grabbed me and I don&#39;t know what I said, then she asked if 
I forgave her or not.&quot;
	&quot;What did you say?&quot; Ami asked anxiously.
	Minako looked away again.  &quot;I didn&#39;t say anything.  I 
kissed her.&quot;
	&quot;Do you forgive her though?  If you kissed and 
everything...&quot;
	Minako shrugged.  &quot;I don&#39;t know.  I missed her; I 
liked being with her again.  And it was so good...&quot;
	Ami blushed as Usagi giggled.  &quot;Well then it seems 
like you&#39;re more than ready to work it out.  I know Rei-
chan is. She&#39;s desperate for your forgiveness Mina-chan.  
Please come with us this afternoon.&quot;
	Minako listened to Ami and with a sigh and agreed.  &quot;I 
guess I have to.  Even Mako-chan looked pissed at me this 
morning.&quot;
	&quot;She did, didn&#39;t she?&quot;  Usagi noted, but turned a sly 
smile on Ami.  &quot;Ami-chan, why don&#39;t you say something to 
your girlfriend?&quot;
	Ami turned pink as Minako laughed and joined in, 
&quot;Yeah, Ami-chan, I&#39;m sure you know how to lighten her up.&quot;
	&quot;Pay attention to Sensei&quot;, She squeaked, covering her 
face with a notebook. 

	The study meeting was quiet.  Usagi snored behind a 
textbook, but was not reprimanded by Ami, whose attention 
was given fully to Makoto&#39;s whisperings in her ear.  Having 
given up on completing any physics homework, Rei watched 
their affectionate antics with a bitter look on her face, 
reminded that at one time, that would have been her and 
Minako. Minako herself was sitting as far away from Rei as 
she possibly could, doodling on her notebook cover idly.  
	Time passed like this until finally Makoto announced, 
&quot;Well, Ami and I have to go.&quot;
	&quot;Walking her to cram school?&quot; Usagi asked through a 
big yawn.
	&quot;Yes,&quot; Ami answered quickly as Makoto chuckled, 
deciding the real reason was not vital knowledge for her 
friends.  &quot;See you tomorrow!&quot;
	&quot;I guess we should go too, Usagi-chan,&quot; Minako 
suggested, dying to get out of there.  
	Usagi looked at Rei, but the miko looked away.  &quot;Sure, 
Mina-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Minako,&quot; Rei finally said as they finished packing 
up, her voice even and casual, &quot;I think you should stay.&quot;
	Minako was surprised at her boldness.  She looked to 
Usagi for rescuing, but the blonde intentionally turned the 
other way, knowing she could not, and would not, help her 
out of this.  Realizing this, Minako&#39;s mouth tightened into 
a line, replying, &quot;Why?&quot;
	&quot;You know why.&quot;
	It was all Rei had to say to get her to drop her bag 
back onto the floor and send Usagi out of the shrine with a 
hurried goodbye.  She stood near the door with her back to 
Rei.  
	The miko sighed, standing up as well.  &quot;You can&#39;t just 
go on pretending like it never happened, Minako.  It 
happened.  And I think it happened for a reason.&quot;
	&quot;And what reason is that?&quot; Minako asked curiously over 
her shoulder.
	Rei smiled softly.  She went silently to the blond, 
putting her arms around her waist.  &quot;You still love me,&quot; 
She whispered.  
	She closed her eyes, turning in Rei&#39;s arms to return 
the embrace.  &quot;I do still love you Rei.&quot;  She let herself 
smile as the miko held her tighter, &quot;I never stopped loving 
you.&quot;
	 &quot;I knew it!&quot; Rei rejoiced, kissing her cheek, &quot;I knew 
you would forgive me.  I knew we&#39;d get back together...&quot;  She 
smiled uncontrollably, leaning in for a kiss.  Minako, 
however, pulled away, keeping Rei at arm&#39;s length.  She 
became worried suddenly; Minako&#39;s face not conveying the 
same emotions that Rei was feeling. &quot;What?&quot;  
	Minako could feel the tears begin to push at the back 
of her eyes.  Rei&#39;s face fell as she began to cry.  &quot;Oh 
God...  Minako, what is it?&quot; She pleaded, holding her by the 
shoulders.  
	&quot;I...&quot; The blonde sniffed, wiping her eyes with the back 
of her hand.  She sighed, &quot;Rei, I love you.  But...  I can&#39;t 
be with you.&quot;  
	Rei let go of her.  She looked at Minako, obviously 
perplexed.  &quot;What-Minako that doesn&#39;t make any sense! Of 
course you can be with me!&quot;
	&quot;No.&quot; She said calmly, though through some tears, &quot;No, 
I can&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;But you love me! And I love you, and you forgave me!  
How...&quot; Rei paused, trying to keep her own emotions in check, 
&quot;How can you not want to be with me?&quot;
	Minako wiped her tears away even as they continually 
poured out of her eyes.  She tried to keep it together, for 
the sake of expressing her feelings frankly.  &quot;I don&#39;t 
trust you anymore Rei.  I can&#39;t trust you anymore.  And I 
can&#39;t be with someone I don&#39;t trust.&quot;
	Rei&#39;s eyes glazed over.  She snapped.  &quot;Then why the 
fuck did you fuck me!?  Mina?  What the fuck have I been 
doing if you &#39;can&#39;t&#39; be with me?  Why are you fucking with 
my head?&quot;
	&quot;You wanted me to forgive you and you should be happy 
I even gave you that after what you did to me, Rei,&quot; Minako 
matched her intense glare, neck bulging as she screamed.  
&quot;Don&#39;t you dare act like that you&#39;ve been hurt more than I 
have.&quot;
	Rei was appalled.  &quot;You don&#39;t know what I went through 
just to get my friends to speak to me again,&quot; She said in a 
menacingly low voice, &quot;I was on my fucking knees, 
apologizing and explaining to more people than I needed to, 
just to get you to fucking talk to me again!  I made one 
mistake Mina, one mistake.  And I had to go through hell to 
get you to even listen to me.  I wanted to work it out, I 
wanted to fix it, and you?  You give me this bullshit.&quot;
	&quot;Oh my God, I can&#39;t believe you,&quot; Minako nearly 
laughed at Rei&#39;s absurd reasoning.  &quot;So you think all that 
you &#39;went through&#39;&quot; She said the phrase with air quotes, 
&quot;Is somehow worse than you breaking my fucking heart?  Rei, 
you hurt me.  And you humiliated me.  And you expect me to 
come back to you like it never happened?&quot;
	&quot;No, I don&#39;t fucking expect that!&quot; Rei roared, 
stomping to the other side of the room.  &quot;What I expected 
was...&quot;  The miko didn&#39;t even know what she expected.  She 
closed her eyes, realizing that the situation right now, 
them yelling at each other, was the best she could have 
hoped for.  After what she did, how could Minako trust her 
again?  
	It was hopeless, she realized.  All her being had been 
put into getting Minako back, and now at this relatively 
late date, it was hopeless.  She put a hand over her mouth, 
muffling the sudden violent sobs of despair.  
	Minako looked away.  After everything, she still 
couldn&#39;t see Rei like that.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry that this-I don&#39;t 
know.  We should&#39;ve never been together in the first 
place.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks for the fuckin&#39; consolation.&quot; Rei said 
bitingly through her tears.
	&quot;God...&quot; Minako sighed, the situation was unbearable, 
&quot;Don&#39;t be angry-oh wait, I forgot who I was talking to.  
Let&#39;s just... let it be.&quot;
	Rei nodded sarcastically, she was uncontrollably 
angry.  &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s do that.  Let&#39;s make this whole thing 
more convenient for you.  So you can move on and fuck with 
someone else&#39;s head.&quot;
	&quot;Oh yes, and while we&#39;re at it, you can find some 
other dumb blonde&#39;s heart to break.  Maybe Usagi this 
time?&quot;
	&quot;What?!&quot; Rei screamed, unable to believe that she 
would bring up a long forgotten issue, once significant 
early in their relationship, &quot;Don&#39;t start that shit now!  
You are so petty!&quot;
	Minako looked away again, somewhat ashamed that she 
had reached so low for a suitable comeback.  &quot;Sorry, I 
didn&#39;t mean to say that.&quot; She said quickly.
	&quot;You know what Minako,&quot; Rei said suddenly, &quot;You&#39;re 
right.  You&#39;re right, we can&#39;t be together, we shouldn&#39;t be 
together; I don&#39;t know why I wanted you back for so long 
anyway, because right now I hate you.&quot;  
	&quot;Oh you hate me?  That&#39;s great, because I hate you 
too.&quot;  Minako spat back at her, grabbing her bag off the 
floor and heading for the door.  &quot;I don&#39;t even know how I 
could&#39;ve fallen in love with such an arrogant, nasty, 
overbearing bitch like you.&quot;
	Rei followed her to the door, throwing it open.  &quot;I 
can&#39;t even imagine how I could&#39;ve been with a crazy, 
fickle, mind-fuck like you for as long as I was.&quot;
	&quot;Well you managed to even fuck that up didn&#39;t you?&quot;  
	&quot;Minako,&quot; Rei gritted her name out through clenched 
teeth.
	&quot;What?&quot; Minako replied staring her in the face, their 
noses almost touching, and the feeling of mutual disgust 
and anger emanating from them.  
	Rei stared her down. Minako&#39;s sky blue eyes, for once, 
matched the intensity of the miko&#39;s.  After a few seconds, 
Rei closed the door again.

	&quot;That&#39;s the last time,&quot; Minako announced, picking her 
school uniform up from the floor.  &quot;Where&#39;s my bow?&quot;
	Rei handed it to her, sighing heavily.
	Minako looked at her.  &quot;Seriously.&quot;
	&quot;I get it.  I didn&#39;t forget all that stuff you were 
screaming at me earlier.&quot;  She finally picked herself up 
off the floor and donned her shrine robes as Minako 
continued to dress.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, barely above a 
whisper, &quot;For whatever I said before.  I was angry.&quot;  She 
finished with an embarrassed blush.
	&quot;Of course you were angry, what else would you be?&quot;
	&quot;Hey, I&#39;m trying to apologize!&quot; Rei&#39;s voice rose, yet 
again.  This time however, Minako grinned at her.
	&quot;Rei, I was teasing.  Jeez...&quot;
	Rei smiled despite herself.  &quot;&#39;Of course you were, 
what else would you do?&#39;&quot; She mocked Minako, who chuckled, 
throwing the comb she was using at her.  &quot;Seriously though 
Mina-I mean Mina-chan.  We&#39;re fine, right?&quot;
	Minako looked at her, nodding.  &quot;I guess we are, yeah.  
As long as we can be friends, like we were before.&quot;
	Rei closed her eyes, she didn&#39;t know if she had it in 
her to ever just see Minako as a friend again.  But she 
couldn&#39;t say that.  &quot;Sure we can.&quot;
	&quot;Rei...-chan,&quot; Minako started awkwardly as she gathered 
her things to go, for the third time, &quot;It&#39;s good that 
there&#39;s finally some closure.  Let&#39;s put this behind us.&quot;
	Rei quelled the instant contradictory replies that 
popped into her head.  &quot;Yeah, closure.  Well, see you 
tomorrow morning.&quot;
	Minako kissed her cheek, &quot;Bye, Rei-chan.&quot;
	Rei waved to the back of her blond head.  &quot;Bye Mina.&quot;</pre>
