<h1>Darkness (part 10 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>Serena slightly shifted and slowly opened her eyes. She felt a weight 
on her side and looked down. She saw Rei snuggling into her while she 
slept. Serena smiled as she reached down and brushed some of Rei&#39;s 
hair from her closed eyelids.

Rei shifted slighted and then wrapped her arms tightly around Serena&#39;s 
waist. With the new position Rei was practically on top of Serena. 
Serena blushed, but didn&#39;t mind Rei&#39;s body draped over her. Serena 
blushed again at her thoughts as she tried to get Rei off of her.

With Serena&#39;s struggling Rei&#39;s grip got even tighter around her. 
Serena sighed and sunk back into the bed. She looked over towards 
Amy&#39;s bed to find that the blue haired girl was no where in site. 
Serena sighed again as she looked back at Rei.

Serena looked over the girl&#39;s body absent mindedly as she began to 
take in the girls beauty. She looked over the girl&#39;s long raven locks 
to her large amethyst eyes which were closed at the moment. Serena 
continued to look over Rei&#39;s body skipping the girl&#39;s lips.

She looked over the body which will soon shape out when she&#39;s older 
then down to her long legs. Serena then went back up to Rei&#39;s lips. 
The nice kissable lips that begged for attention. Serena unconsciously 
began to bend down, but was broken out of her trance when there was a 
knock on the door.

After the knock the door opened. Amara&#39;s head popped into the door 
with a knowing smile. She casually walked into the room with a mocking 
smirk. Serena groaned knowing what was coming next.

&quot;Aww you two look so cute together!&quot;, exclaimed Amara teasingly.

&quot;Leave me alone.&quot;, pouted Serena. Amara fiend hurt as she sat down on 
the bed.

&quot;All I came up here was to tell you two love birds to come down for 
breakfast, but noooo I get yelled at.&quot;, said Amara with a grin. Serena 
glared back at her and then looked back at Rei and saw that she had 
been running her fingers threw Rei&#39;s raven locks.

Serena stopped the strokes and got protests from the sleeping girl. 
Rei whimpered slightly wanting the attention she was getting and 
opened her eyes groggily.

When she opened her eyes she saw a blushing Serena and a grinning 
Amara. Rei looked up in confusion and then looked at the position she 
was in with Serena. Rei blushed slightly and quickly got off of Serena 
as she stared down at her hands in embarrassment.

Amara roared out in laughter which made the two girls redden even more 
in embarrassment. There was a knock on the door and Hotaru came into 
the room with Michelle following her tracks. Michelle slightly frowned 
already knowing what was going on.

&quot;Amara! Would you leave them alone. You act so childish sometimes.&quot;, 
said Michelle scolding.

&quot;Which adds to my charms.&quot;, exclaimed Amara. Amara ducked when 
Michelle tossed a pillow at her head. Amara walked to the door and 
began opening it up.

&quot;Hope to see you two love birds at breakfast!&quot;, yelled Amara before 
she ran out the door with Michelle chasing after her. Hotaru shook her 
head at her parents and looked towards Serena and Rei.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s go eat.&quot;, said Hotaru before she to left the room 
leaving Serena and Rei alone. Serena looked towards Rei who was 
blushing madly. Serena got off the bed and held out a hand for Rei. 
Rei looked up at the hand before she herself brought out her hand and 
slipped it into Serena&#39;s.

Serena smiled and pulled the girl off the bed. Serena kept a hold on 
Rei&#39;s hand as they both laced their fingers together. They both 
blushed but didn&#39;t really mind the small gesture of affection. They 
walked out of the room hand in hand.

When they made it to the kitchen they both unlocked their fingers and 
let them fall to their sides. When they entered the kitchen they saw 
Setsuna getting out the blood from the fridge with Amy helping her. 
Hotaru and Rini sat at the kitchen table and were talking excitedly 
towards each other.

Amara sat in a chair at the table with a hand rubbing the back of her 
head. She sat slouched and she had a sulking look on her face. 
Michelle sat next to her with her arms crossed over her chest and was 
slightly glaring at her lover.

Serena and Rei walked over to the table and sat down next to each 
other. Michelle smiled at them as Amara glared them. Hotaru and Rini 
waved at them as Amy and Setsuna brought the blood over to the table.

Everyone&#39;s eyes flashed green upon seeing the red liquid as their 
fangs automatically began to appear. Everyone took a large mug that 
was filled to the top with blood. Without a word they chug down the 
blood hungrily.

When they were finished they set the mugs down quietly. They all felt 
their fangs disappear and their eyes turn back to normal. They wiped 
their mouths and sat back in their chair for a while.

&quot;So what are we going to do today?&quot;, asked Serena breaking the 
silence.

&quot;Well, Amara, Michelle, Amy and I are going back to your old hide out 
to see if there are any survivors.&quot;, said Setsuna.

&quot;What about the rest of us?&quot;, exclaimed Hotaru.

&quot;You four are staying here, where it&#39;s safe.&quot;, said Michelle.

&quot;But..&quot;, protested Rei.

&quot;No butt&#146;s. You are to stay here. Is that understood?&quot;, replied Amara 
leaving no room for argument. The four girls nodded their heads with a 
frown.

&quot;Good. now go play.&quot;, said Amara flipping her hand towards the door.

The four girls got up silently and drag themselves over dramatically 
out of the kitchen.

Setsuna laughed at their behavior as the three adults and child 
cleaned up the kitchen. When they were finished they bid their 
goodbyes and walked out of the house and into Amara&#39;s car.

The four girls watched them leave as they gave out a sigh.

&quot;That&#39;s not fair, how come Amy get&#39;s to go?&quot;, whined Rini.

&quot;I don&#39;t know. It doesn&#146;t matter now since they left already.&quot;, said 
Rei.

&quot;Well I&#39;m going to take a bath so goodbye.&quot;, said Serena as she began 
walking back to her room.

&quot;Well me and Hotaru are going to play with some Lego&#146;s.&quot;, said Rini as 
she helped Hotaru up. They both left and Rei sat by herself on the 
couch in the living room. Suddenly she put up a devious smirk and 
chased after Serena into the bedroom.

Rei walked into the bedroom and saw nobody in the room. She could hear 
a slight humming sound coming from the bathroom and she could hear the 
water running into the tub. Rei smirked again as she opened the 
bathroom door to see Serena stepping into the tub.

Serena sat down into the bathtub, taking in the comfort of the warm 
water and the bubbles. She could have sworn she heard the bathroom 
door being opened and than closed, but had dismissed it as nothing. 
Serena closed her eyes and sunk deeper into the water until the water 
was up to her chin.

She reached out for her wash cloth to find out that it wasn&#39;t there. 
Serena opened her eyes to see Rei staring at her amused.

&quot;Rei, what are you doing in here?&quot;, screeched Serena. Serena covered 
her self up with her hands and blushed deeply. Rei laughed at the 
girl&#39;s desperate attempts to cover up, but to no avail.

&quot;I don&#39;t know why your doing that. It&#39;s not like I&#39;ve never seen you 
before.&quot;, said Rei with a grin. Serena glared at Rei before she 
relaxed in the water.

&quot;Well can I have my wash cloth back?&quot;, asked Serena as she lifted out 
a hand. Rei grinned yet again and shook her head no.

&quot;Nope.&quot;, said Rei.

&quot;Why not?&quot;, growled Serena. Rei giggled and wagged her finger in front 
of Serena&#39;s face.

&quot;Temper, temper.&quot;, mocked Rei. Serena growled something under her 
breathe before she took up a whole load of bubbles and threw it at 
Rei&#39;s face.

Surprised, Rei wiped the bubbles from her face to be hit again with 
another load. Rei growled lightly and picked up a load her self and 
she tossed some back at Serena. With the little tosses of bubbles soon 
broke out into a bubble war.

Laughter and splashes rung throughout the bathroom as the two vampires 
continued to play. Soon the bubble match turned into a wrestling match 
with the girls began flipping each other in the large bath tub.

Soon Serena had Rei pinned underneath her as they both laughed and 
gasped for air. Their eyes soon bore into each other as they stared at 
each other intently. They became lost in each other&#39;s eyes as they 
began to inch their faces together.

The were so close now that they could feel the warmth of their breaths 
against their lips. Rei and Serena stared at each other for a moment 
before their lips collided with each other.</pre>
