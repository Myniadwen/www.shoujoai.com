Makoto growled as she punched and kicked at one of the trees at the back 
of Rei&#39;s temple. Sweat poured off her body as she hammered on the poor 
tree that was just slightly larger round than her own body. Rei stood on 
the back walkway of the temple, watching her friend with concerned eyes.

It had been only a week since Makoto had changed back. And in the first 
twenty four hours of &quot;waking up&quot;, Makoto had recived a few shocks.

One, she had woken up naked and dirty in a warehouse. There she found 
Rei watching over her. Rei had told her Minako had just left moments 
before. Makoto had tried standing and thats when she noticed she had 
wings. Rei gave Makoto her jacket and the blanket she had brought with 
her to allow Makoto some type of clothing. Not knowing what to do with 
her newly aquired wings, Makoto took the coat and blanket from Rei and 
hid them and her naked body best she could and the pair left the 
building to go to Rei&#39;s car.

From the warehouse to Makoto&#39;s loft, Rei explained to Makoto all that 
had happened. At the mention of Yung Hu&#39;s death, Makoto seemed to space 
out. She remained silent the entire trip to her apartment.

Makoto quickly exited Rei&#39;s car and ran inside the building, thankful it 
was early morning on a sunday and no one saw her.

Makoto quickly made it into her apartment, thankful it was unlocked. She 
knew Minako must have left it open for her, but she wasn&#39;t sure how 
Minako would take to seeing her. Makoto hadn&#39;t been all that sure of 
wanting to see Minako after runnung out on her after her changed back.

Makoto had seen Minako on the way to the bathroom after coming out of 
the bedroom with clean clothes. Makoto had showerd and sometime during 
the shower her wings had disappeared allowing Makoto to put on clothes 
without having to rip holes in the back for her wings. After her shower, 
she packed a bag with a weeks worth of clothes, took her car keys and 
left for Rei&#39;s temple. And thats where she had been for a week, doing 
nothing but training.

The crisp coolnight air stung Rei&#39;s cheeks as she continued to watch her 
friend. Makoto&#39;s hands and shins had finally aquired brusies and cuts 
from the tree, despite the fact Makoto had wrapped a rope tightly around 
it.

Rei knew Makoto well enough to know why she was putting herself thru 
such painful training. She was thinking about what had happened the 
night she transformed and blamed her self for Yung Hu&#39;s death. She was 
also thinking about the situation with Minako and Ami. Rei couldn&#39;t help 
but to groan at the situation herself.

Ami has really messed things up for Mako-chan, Rei thought.

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Rei called out gently. &quot;Why don&#39;t you call it a night?&quot;

Makoto grunted and hit the tree one last time. Rei could have sworn she 
heard something crack as she did so. Makoto then limped sorely away from 
the tree and up the stairs of the temple&#39;s back deck.

Makoto nodded to Rei a goodnight and as she passed the Shinto Preistess, 
Rei stopped her by placing a gentle hand on her arm. Rei felt Makoto&#39;s 
body tense at the contact.

&quot;Mako-chan, why don&#39;t you take a hot bath to soothe your acheing 
muscles? I know they must be hurting you terriably.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Makoto said after a moments pause. Makoto then left the 
raven haired girl outside alone.

Rei sighed and looked up at the stars. Things had been so hard on Makoto 
the past month or so. Rei knew Makoto loved Minako terriably, but when 
Rei had asked Makoto why she didn&#39;t try to get Minako back, Makoto had 
said she refused to force Minako into something; that she wanted Minako 
back when she was ready.

There was no doubt in Rei&#39;s mind Makoto wouldn&#39;t wait an eternity for 
Minako. She had already been doing it when they had met.

And then there was the problem with Ami. Why was she acting so strange? 
First she didn&#39;t want anything to do with Makoto, then she&#39;s throwing 
herself at the amazon. It wasn&#39;t making any sense to the fire senshi.

Rei gently rubbed her temples in a way so her head would stop hurting. 
The motion only made it worse. Rei, deciding she had been thinking too 
long and hard about this, turned and walked inside the temple.

As she walked past the spare bedroom, she peeked inside and saw Makoto 
laying on the bad, one arm draped over her eyes. Rei couldn&#39;t help but 
to feel badly for her friend. Sighing once again, she headed to her room 
for the night.

Rei awakened the next morning to the sound of Makoto out back practicing 
her moves once again. Rei sat up in her bed and looked out the window to 
watch Makoto.

Rei shook her head. &quot;She&#39;s going to kill herself if she doesn&#39;t stop 
this,&quot; she said out loud to herself. Rei stood and dressed for school. 
She gathered her school bag and walked out towards the front of her 
home. As she reached the stairs, she saw a familiar blonde walking up 
them.

&quot;Morning, Mina-chan,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Minako called back. &quot;Is Mako-chan here?&quot;

Rei nodded. &quot;But i wouldn&#39;t recomend going to see her right now. She&#39;s 
training. You won&#39;t be able to get a word in edge wise while she&#39;s 
punching at that tree.&quot;

&quot;Can&#39;t I at least try?&quot;

Rei shook her head. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t push it right now, Mina-chan. She&#39;s 
under a lot of stress and she has a lot on her mind.&quot;

Minako stood there a moment before nodding. &quot;You&#39;re right, Rei.&quot; Minako 
turned and smiled slightly. &quot;I&#39;ll see you later. Ja.&quot;

Rei watched her friend leave and dissappear around the corner before she 
herself began to trot down the temple&#39;s stairs and headed off to school.

Crickets chirped loudly around Makoto as she sat under a tree near Yung 
Hu&#39;s grave marker. Her over sized leather jacket was fastened around her 
due to the chilly spring night air. In her hands, she sat strumming her 
guitar. Her breath bellowed out in puffs of smoke as she sang...

And you
Bring me to my knees
Again
All the times
That I could beg you please
In vain
All the times
That I felt insecure
For you
And I leave
My burdens at the door

But I&#39;m on the outside
I&#39;m looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
&#39;Cause inside your ugly
You&#39;re ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

All the times
That I felt like this won&#39;t end
It&#39;s for you
And I taste
What I could never have
It was from you
All the times
That I&#39;ve cried
My intentions
Full of pride
But I waste
More time than anyone

But I&#39;m on the outside
And I&#39;m looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
&#39;Cause inside you&#39;re ugly
You&#39;re ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

All the times
That I&#39;ve cried
All this wasted
It&#39;s all inside
And I feel
All this pain
Stuffed it down
It&#39;s back again
And I lie
Here in bed
All alone
I can&#39;t mend
But I feel
Tomorrow will be OK

But I&#39;m on the outside
And I&#39;m looking in
I can see through you
See your true colors
&#39;Cause inside you&#39;re ugly
You&#39;re ugly like me
I can see through you
See to the real you

&quot;Nice song.&quot;

Makoto turned and glared at the girl behind her. &quot;When did you get here 
Ami?&quot;

&quot;Just when you started singing,&quot; said the blue haired girl. &quot;You have a 
beautiful singing voice.&quot;

Makoto sighed heavily in an annoyed sort of way. &quot;What do you want?&quot;

&quot;You.&quot;

Makoto turned and her look became deadly.

Ami blushed and toed the ground. &quot;Well, I want to say that anyway. I 
came by to tell you that I&#39;m leaving next week.&quot;

Makoto shrugged. &quot;So?&quot;

&quot;I wanted to tell you,&quot; Ami said. &quot;No one else is going to know.&quot;

&quot;What makes me so special,&quot; Makoto demanded.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Ami said.

Makoto finally snapped. &quot;LOVE ME!? Ha! Girl, you only want me because 
you know you can never have me! And after what happened between me and 
Minako because of YOU!? You&#39;re lucky I don&#39;t kill you here and now. She 
won&#39;t even TALK to me because of you!&quot;

Ami looked down in shame. &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

Makoto groaned and shook her head. &quot;Get away from me. Now. I don&#39;t care 
that you&#39;re leaving. I. Don&#39;t. Care. About. You.&quot;

Ami stood there a few moments before turning and leaving. Makoto sighed 
to get her temper under control.

She began to strum a few more chords when she heard a twig snap. 
Growling she turned and yelled, &quot;AMI! I TOLD YOU...to...&quot;

No one was there. Makoto blinked and turned bck around and jumped when 
she saw the person who had stepped on the twig in front of her.

&quot;Chibi-Usa! Don&#39;t DO that!&quot; Makoto gasped. &quot;Nearly gave me a heart 
attack.&quot;

The small pink rabbit smiled weakily at Makoto. &quot;Gomen, Mako-chan.&quot;

The amazon settled back down and looked at the child. &quot;What are you 
doing out here? Its past midnight.&quot;

Chibi Usa kicked the ground slightly. &quot;Usagi told me today you 
had...woken up. I wanted to come see you.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you do that during the day?&quot;

&quot;I heard Rei said no one should see you because you were working out. 
She thought it&#39;d be a bad idea.&quot;

Makoto nodded. Prolly would have been, she thought. &quot;Why&#39;d you want to 
see me?&quot;

Chibi Usa blinked then turned to look at Yung Hu&#39;s grave. &quot;I miss him.&quot;

&quot;...I do too.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to talk to you about it because you&#39;re the only one who knew 
him like I did.&quot;

Makoto sighed and unzipped her jacket. &quot;You look cold. Come here, little 
princess.&quot; Chibi Usa walked over and sat in Makoto&#39;s lap. Makoto let 
Chibi Usa become comfortable before zipping the jacket over herself and 
the child and wrapping her arms around her as well.

They sat that way for a while, Chibi Usa listening to Makoto&#39;s heart 
before she said anything else. &quot;You&#39;re hard.&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re hard,&quot; Chibi Usa repeated. &quot;And cold. And powerful. Possiably 
even cruel.&quot;

Makoto shifted un easily in her spot.

&quot;But you&#39;re warm at the same time,&quot; Chibi Usa continued. &quot;You&#39;re warm, 
soft, gentle and never needlessly cruel. You&#39;re too careing for that.&quot;

Makoto blushed.

&quot;You&#39;re just like Yung Hu was.&quot; Chibi Usa sniffled and snuggled closer. 
Instintivly, Makoto pulled her closer.

&quot;I probably got that from him.&quot;

&quot;Do you hate me, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Why would I hate you?&quot;

&quot;Because it was my fault,&quot; the child said quietly.

&quot;Yung Hu&#39;s death was your fault? Is that what you think?&quot; Chibi Usa 
nodded. &quot;No sweetie. I don&#39;t blame you because it wasn&#39;t your fault. You 
had no control over what happened.&quot;

&quot;If I hadn&#39;t left, there would have been no battle...&quot;

Makoto shook her head. &quot;If you&#39;re gonna do that then blame Ami. Had she 
not kissed me and Minako had not seen that, you&#39;d have had no reason to 
leave.&quot;

&quot;...So you blame Ami?&quot;

&quot;I blame no one but Rubeus and he&#39;s dead now.&quot;

Chibi Usa snuggled closer to Makoto.

&quot;Does anyone know you&#39;re here?&quot;

Chibi Usa remained quiet. &quot;Um...princess?&quot; Makoto looked down and saw 
the small child had fallen asleep. Sighing, but grinning slightly, 
Makoto carefully stood and held Chibi Usa with one hand. With her other 
she picked up her guitar and began to walk towards the temple.

As Makoto neared the stairs, Rei came running out the doors. &quot;Mako-chan! 
We have to find Chibi Usa! Usagi called and said she was-&quot; Rei stopped 
when she saw Makoto smile.

&quot;I know.&quot; Makoto neared the light from the temple.

Rei sighed, visably relieved. &quot;How long have you had her?&quot;

Makoto shook her head as she climbed the few steps to the back porch. 
&quot;Not long. Fifteen minutes tops.&quot;

Rei nodded and slid the door open for Makoto. &quot;Well lets get her inside. 
I&#39;ll call Usagi and let her know we have her.&quot;

Makoto nodded and stepped inside the temple and Rei followed her, 
shutting the door softly behind them.

Makoto walked to the room she had been occupying that week and unzipped 
her jacket. After setting her guitar down, Makoto gently took Chibi Usa 
and laid the child onto the bed then drew the covers up around her. 
Makoto smiled softly and left the room, Rei waiting for her outside in 
the hall.

&quot;I told Usagi. She&#39;s going to come get Chibi Usa in the morning.&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Good idea.&quot;

&quot;Um, someone came by here to see you tonight,&quot; Rei said.

Makoto&#39;s mood darkened. &quot;I know. I talked to Ami when she showed up.&quot;

Rei blinked. &quot;I was talking about Minako. When was Ami here?&quot;

&quot;Just before I saw Chibi Usa.&quot; Makoto sighed, letting her anger simmer 
down. &quot;What did Minako want?&quot;

Rei shrugged. &quot;Ask her yourself. She&#39;s out front.&quot; With that Rei left to 
go back to bed, leaving Makoto alone.

Makoto stood there a moment before going towards the temple&#39;s doors 
leading to the front of the grounds. The only place visters were allowed 
to be. Out side, standing next to one of the colums holding the covering 
of the temple&#39;s walk way stood Minako, her breath coming out in puffs of 
smoke.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;Morning?&quot; Minako asked, confused.

&quot;Its past midnight. Its now morning,&quot; Makoto explained.

&quot;I haven&#39;t been to bed yet so its still night for me.&quot;

Makoto shrugged and leaned on one of the other colums. &quot;What did you 
want?&quot;

&quot;To aplogize,&quot; Minako said, looking at the ground.

&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For acting like a total bitch. I should have let you explain what 
happened before I got upset.&quot;

Makoto nodded her agreement. &quot;Accepted.&quot;

Minako looked up. &quot;Excuse me?&quot;

Makoto smiled and looked over at Minako. &quot;Apology accepted. I probably 
would have done the same thing myself.&quot;

Minako walked over to Makoto and wrapped her arms around the taller girl 
and laid her head on Makoto&#39;s chest. In turn, Makoto wrapped her arms 
around Minako and held her tightly.</pre>
