<h1>Minako's Warrior (part 2 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/minwar-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Usagi&#39;s wails had died down to a few sniffles, Luna was prowling back
and forth with only an occasional remark about Artemis made under her
breath. Minako and Usagi had moved Makoto to the couch with some
difficulty, they had to transform in order to pick the lanky girl up.
Makoto might not show it but man you could feel how much she really did
enjoy her own cooking. Her eyes were still spinning but at least she
had stopped drooling. Luna said it was better if they just left Makoto
knocked out till everything was discussed.

&quot;Now Mina, exactly how long has Artemis known about this...
&#39;arrangement&#39;?&quot;

Minako chewed on her lip, &quot;Ummm... three, maybe four weeks...&quot; she
answered Luna. Usagi started to cry again and Luna&#39;s fur was spiked on
her back. She started grumbling again about the white cat. Minako
didn&#39;t know whether to console Usagi or to stick up for Artemis. She
decided Usagi was the easiest to deal with. Luna could just stew for
awhile, it wasn&#39;t like she would listen to anything good about the
other lunar cat just yet.

&quot;Usagi would you please tell me why you are crying? I didn&#39;t think me
being bi would make you so upset. And you know Makoto, so it&#39;s not like
I&#39;m with some stranger...&quot; Usagi began sobbing more.

&quot;You kept it a secret from ME!&quot; Usagi took a few shuddering breaths
between sobs. &quot;You are my best friend! ...and ...and ...and ...and YOU
SAID Makoto was your best friend now... her NOT ME!!&quot;

Minako facefualted but she knew Usagi was really upset about this. She
had to handle this very gently. &quot;Usagi you are my best friend, truly.
Makoto and I are more than friends though. You know how it is with you
and Mamoru, it&#39;s like that with me and Makoto. She is my best friend in
a different way than you are. It&#39;s like a coin. Two faces of the same
tail. You and Makoto are the faces looking at my tail.&quot;

Usagi looked at her confused and sniffled once more. &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;You will always be my best friend Usagi. I wanted to tell you but I
couldn&#39;t. Makoto wasn&#39;t ready and I couldn&#39;t do anything to hurt her
and I didn&#39;t think not telling you right away would hurt you. I thought
you would be really happy for me.&quot; Minako sighed and looked down, &quot;But
if you don&#39;t want to be my friend anymore I guess I can understand
that.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s eyes grew big and her tears were magically gone. &quot;What do you
mean not be your friend! You&#39;re Sailor V. I&#39;ve always looked up to you
and now you think I don&#39;t want to be your friend because you didn&#39;t
tell me about you and Makoto. What ever gave you that idea? It&#39;s not
like I was that upset about you not telling me, really Mina-chan.
You&#39;re so touchy.&quot;

Minako looked up with a big smile. &quot;So we&#39;re still friends?&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Usagi gave the other blonde a huge hug. &quot;Like I could ever be
mad at you. SO! You have to tell me what it&#39;s like.&quot; Suddenly it was
gossip hour and the two began chattering a mile a minute while Luna was
still prowling and muttering.

Makoto was slowly coming out of her faint but the buzzing in her ears
from the on going conversation kept her from becoming fully alert. Her
eyes weren&#39;t spinning anymore but she kept them closed and tried to
make her way back to reality and away from the horrible dream she had
about Minako blurting everything out to Luna and Usagi.

Luna interrupted the two blondes and drew their attention to the groggy
brunette. Usagi had been leaning over and staring at the necklace
Minako was given with emotional eyes and a quivering lip. It was such a
beautiful love story. Almost as good as her and her Mamo-chan&#39;s. But
Minako pulled away when she wasn&#39;t paying attention and her face
smacking the floor brought her out of her romantic reverie rather
painfully.

The black cat was poised on Makoto&#39;s chest peering at her and Minako
was gently stroking her forehead. Usagi was beside them rubbing her own
forehead which had a red mark. &quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako whispered softly,
&quot;come on sleepy head. Time to waky waky and shaky shaky.&quot;

Makoto stirred and moaned quietly. &quot;Angel, just... just let me lie here
... I&#39;ll wake up soon soon,&quot; she managed to mumble. She wanted to clear
that dream away from her foggy mind.

&quot;Huh uh baby. Time to get up. Luna and Usagi are worried about you.&quot;
Minako said ruthlessly jabbing her in the side. But her tactics worked
and Makoto bolted upright on the couch. Luna, unfortunately, went
airborne for a short flight before landing on her head by Makoto&#39;s
feet.

Minako turned to the cat, &quot;What is it with you two hitting your
heads... is it a moon thing or something. It can&#39;t be good for you. We
don&#39;t do that stuff on Venus.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;What I&#39;m saying is that your involvement with each other could
endanger the moon princess. I&#39;m not saying the relationship is bad in
&#39;that&#39; way.&quot; Luna tried to explain again looking at Usagi and willing
it to sink in through her thick skull.

&quot;It won&#39;t endanger me Luna. It will make the team stronger. You&#39;re just
not accepting them.&quot;

They had been in a circular argument for twenty minutes now. Luna was
showing her concern and Usagi was valiantly defending her friends.
Minako broke into the argument wanting things to be settled. &quot;I can see
why Luna has her concerns Usagi-chan. Artemis has said the same thing
but it doesn&#39;t mean they are being judgmental about our lifestyle.&quot;
Luna nodded and Usagi looked over to Makoto who had recovered but
remained pensive. In fact she had said very little since waking up.

&quot;Do you think you&#39;ll endanger me Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;No Usagi. It is my duty to protect you first and foremost. It is also
my duty to protect all my friends.&quot;

&quot;But will you be protecting Minako more than the others?&quot; Luna
countered and looked at Minako, &quot;and vise versa? This is a very serious
question. If one of you is in danger and so is Sailor Moon, where will
your loyalties lie...&quot;

Both scouts we quiet. Usagi was glaring at Luna thinking it was a cruel
question. They had already risked their lives for her so many times and
each time she was grateful yet she hated it too. Makoto reached out and
squeezed Minako&#39;s hand. Looking into each others eyes they knew what
the answer was and they both understood what it really meant.

&quot;We will protect Sailor Moon.&quot; Minako answered.

&quot;We wouldn&#39;t forgive each other if we sacrificed Sailor Moon over
ourselves. It doesn&#39;t mean don&#39;t love each other deeply. We know what
is important.&quot; Makoto stated. She didn&#39;t mention how crazy she would go
on anything that would dare harm Minako though.

Minako nodded. Luna looked at both of them and let out a soft breath in
acceptance. Suddenly both Mina and Mako were tackled by Usagi who was
again wailing.

After Usagi&#39;s blubbering had died off to a few sniffles they began
discussing when they were going to tell the others. Luna had decided to
go find Artemis and show him exactly how many ways one could skin a
cat. She was still put off by the fact that he had kept it a secret for
so long and no pleading by any of the girls would make her see reason.

&quot;Well I think we should break it to Rei last. I don&#39;t know how well
she&#39;s going to take it considering she&#39;s a priestess and all.&quot; Makoto
suggested.

&quot;Yeah and if we have Ami on our side first she can calm Rei down and
make her listen.&quot; Minako added.

Usagi looked really unsure. She had dealt with Rei&#39;s anger, if badly,
and knew that it wasn&#39;t that easy to make her see things in a different
light. Something nagged at the back of her mind though that she
couldn&#39;t quite place. Whatever it was though, she didn&#39;t think Rei
would be that adverse to the idea of Makoto and Minako being together.

&quot;How should we tell Mamoru, Usagi-chan?&quot;

All thoughts of Rei and her odd quirks disappeared and were replaced by
thoughts of her Mamo-chan. And with those thoughts came and idea. A
sneaky grin appeared on her face and she waggled her eyebrows. &quot;Let go
on a double date and surprise him.&quot;

&quot;Umm... Usagi... I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s such a good id-&quot; Makoto was cut
off by a shriek of excitement from Minako.

&quot;Oh that would be such a blast Usagi. What a perfect idea! We can go
shopping for new outfits and corridor them and everything.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t you mean coordinate dear.&quot;

&quot;She knew what I meant love... isn&#39;t that right Usagi.&quot;

Usagi nodded thinking of shopping and food and Mamoru. She was in
daydream heaven.

&quot;Speaking of clothes Mina-chan... when are you going to return all my
nice clothes that you borrowed. I look like I shop at the Salvation
Army with the wardrobe you&#39;ve left for me.&quot; Makoto complained, her eyes
narrowed.

&quot;Well this just gives you an excuse to buy some new things then doesn&#39;t
it.&quot; Minako turned back to Usagi and they began making plans for the
date.

Makoto rolled her eyes and sweatdropped, although it worked out for the
better. She did want new clothes after all. She was pulled into the
planning by Usagi but her thoughts wandered. For some reason she had a
bad feeling about this whole thing. But then again she was always wary
of Mamoru. There was just something about him she didn&#39;t like. She
shook the thought and wondered how poor Artemis was fairing with Luna.
