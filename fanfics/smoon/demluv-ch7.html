  Usagi woke suddenly, her heart pounded in 
panic. She stared in horror at Rei&#39;s wall clock. 
Neither of them had remembered to set the alarm 
clock.
  Oh no, I&#39;ve missed all my morning classes, and 
I&#39;m about to be late for my afternoon classes!
  &quot;Rei! Wake up! It&#39;s really late in the 
morning!&quot; Usagi ran to the shower, and grabbed a 
towel along the way.
   Rei muttered.
   &quot;No, you&#39;re late. My classes start in the 
afternoon on Mondays. I missed Grandpa&#39;s &#39;after 
the weekend&#39; chores.&quot; She opened an eye to look 
at the clock anyway. 
  Rei shrieked.
  &quot;Aaah, it is almost afternoon, Usagi may I 
join you in there?&quot; 
  Usagi couldn&#39;t quite make out what was said, 
but she saw next, stopped her heart and left her 
mouth agape.
  Kami-sama.
  Rei was a drop dead gorgeous display of 
luxuriant raven hair, and perfect milk-white 
skin. She was physically awesome. She radiated 
the power and beauty of a seasoned warrior. Rei 
was magnificent in every way. Usagi thought she 
would faint, but suddenly found Rei&#39;s arm had 
encircled her tiny waist.
  She grinned wickedly. 
  &quot;Whoa girl... what&#39;s the matter, you&#39;ve never 
seen a naked woman before?&quot;
  Usagi blushed furiously. 
  &quot;Um, I was 14 the last time I saw you naked at 
the Azabu hot springs, and you sure didn&#39;t look 
like this. Nor were you ever this close to me!&quot; 
Usagi exclaimed and grabbed the shampoo.
  &quot;Lets switch places so you can get wet, then 
I&#39;ll do your hair.&quot;
  All thoughts of Usagi&#39;s cold were abandoned as 
Rei kissed Usagi lovingly, longingly, and 
pressed her naked body against Usagi&#39;s. They 
were nipple to nipple for the first time and it 
was wonderful. 
  Usagi turned herself back towards the water 
and Rei away from the water. She applied the 
shampoo to Rei&#39;s long soft black mane. As she 
looked into Rei&#39;s eyes she purposely rubbed the 
back of her neck slowly and kissed her the same 
way.  
  Usagi switched positions again so Rei could be 
under the water and her hair could rinse off. 
When Rei leaned her head back to rinse her hair 
off, Usagi first traced a finger downward along 
her neck, then began to suck on Rei&#39;s beautiful 
exposed throat gently while she reached around 
for the body wash. 
  She turned the water off temporarily and 
pulled back to pour some of the liquid into her 
palm. 
  Rei opened her eyes in time to see Usagi&#39;s 
hands as they approached her breasts. When they 
touched and began to massage the soap on, her 
nipples hardened and grew slightly. Rei thought 
she hadn&#39;t ever felt anything more sensual or 
delightful. Then she felt Usagi&#39;s lips start to 
suck on her right earlobe which sent ripples of 
goose bumps all over her flesh. Rei shivered.  
  Usagi&#39;s hands slowly soaped the rest of Rei&#39;s 
torso, hips, and backside. Her lips recaptured 
Rei&#39;s lips, and her tongue penetrated as her 
fingers moved around to the front, and began 
to gently rub Rei between her legs.
  Rei grinned to her self. It was payback time! 
She had left Usagi in a sexually excited 
condition the night before...  
  Rei&#39;s breath caught. Oh Kami... 
  She rewarded Usagi&#39;s tongue with greater 
access to the back of her throat. 
  Usagi kissed Rei deeply with all her 
considerable passion. 
  Rei &#39;mmmed&#39; loudly into the kiss as Usagi 
found Rei&#39;s clitoris at the same time, and her 
knees suddenly felt weak. Rei&#39;s hips rocked in 
an unconscious rhythm against Usagi&#39;s fingers. 
  Usagi stopped short of penetration, she put 
her arms around Rei, and broke off her kiss. Her 
voice was cracked when she spoke.
  &quot;Kami forgive me, Rei, I want you! You turn me 
on so hard. I really did want our first time to 
be in bed.&quot; Usagi turned the water back on so 
Rei could rinse off.
  Rei breathed hard as she agreed. Dammit! 
  &quot;Believe me, Usagi, you have the same effect 
on me, but I think you are right. We should 
wait. Here, turn around and let me do your hair 
now.&quot; 
  Usagi obeyed, and allowed herself to be 
carried away by the sensation of Rei&#39;s 
fingertips as they scrubbed her scalp. She 
relaxed into Rei&#39;s methodical touch, her skin 
tingled, and she wanted more. 
  Rei stepped around Usagi and pushed her back a 
little so the water could rinse the shampoo 
away. The silver blond hair fell almost to the 
back of her knees. She loved it! Rei held Usagi 
and waltzed her around so Usagi was away from 
the water. She turned Usagi so she faced away 
from her. Rei flipped Usagi&#39;s hair over the left 
shoulder, and revealed her exquisite backside. 
Rei laid kisses upon each shoulder as she rubbed 
body wash over every exposed part. 
  Usagi&#39;s hips danced between Rei&#39;s gentle, sure 
hands, and brushed purposely against Rei&#39;s 
pelvis. 
  Usagi was such a temptress! 
  Both girls felt an inner twinge. It started as 
a throb that emanated from between their legs, 
then the ache rose and spread upwards though 
their loins. 
  Rei lay her cheek against the back of Usagi&#39;s 
long delicate neck, her hands reached around to 
find Usagi&#39;s breasts. 
  Their hearts beat swiftly in unison as they 
moved together, drawn to a silent, urgent 
drummer. 
  Usagi turned around, and Rei&#39;s lips caught 
hers once again. 
  Their veins felt as though the blood in them 
had ignited and burst into flames of raw 
passion.
  When Rei caressed Usagi&#39;s bruised body 
gingerly, she realized the necessity for a 
little patience. 
  Their passionate desire would have to wait!
  Rei&#39;s breath was ragged as she tried to 
control herself. 
  &quot;Kami-sama, you are so sexy! I want to ravish 
you right here, right now, in the worst way, but 
we need to wait until Dr. Wakai says you are 
healed. I think we should wait for our bond 
ceremony, until then, too. I don&#39;t want anything 
in the way that could prevent me from making 
love to you all the way. I just don&#39;t want to 
risk any further injuries.&quot; 
  Rei and Usagi rinsed off in silence. Rei, 
sensed Usagi&#39;s apprehension, and squeezed her 
tight. 
  &quot;It will be all right, Usa, Dr. Wakai is very 
good, and I know you&#39;ll like her.&quot; 
  Rei shut the water off. 
  &quot;I love you, Usagi. After the blood bond, I 
promise that for the rest of my life, I will not 
let a single day go by without the expression of 
my love for you physically.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s body still shook with denied 
fulfillment. She cupped Rei&#39;s lovely face 
between hands that trembled in her desire, and 
kissed her full ruby lips. 
  &quot;I don&#39;t know if I can keep myself away from 
you until then, so I won&#39;t move here to the 
jinja until we&#39;re ready to take the Oath. I also 
have my parents to deal with. Um, how about 
&#39;dating&#39; until then, ne?&quot; 
  The music of Rei&#39;s laughter rang throughout 
the room as they toweled each other off. 
  &quot;Why don&#39;t you pick me up here around 6pm in 
your Subaru, it has awesome air conditioning. 
We&#39;ll have dinner at the Starlight Tower, so 
dress in formal attire, princess! Having been a 
senator&#39;s daughter, I do have some privileges. 
  Speaking of food, I&#39;m starving... you?&quot;
  Usagi nodded in affirmation. 
  &quot;You know me... the bottomless food pit!&quot;
  Rei shook her head incredulously. 
  &quot;I honestly don&#39;t know where you put it! You 
are without a doubt the most fatless person I&#39;ve 
ever seen!&quot;
  Usagi smacked her arm. 
  &quot;I know you really meant &#39;you look like an 
animated scarecrow&#39; or &#39;you and whippets have a 
lot in common&#39;, Rei. You don&#39;t have to pretend 
to be nice when you aren&#39;t! &#39;Nice&#39; doesn&#39;t suit 
you.&quot; 
  Rei clutched at her wounded heart and feigned 
a swoon. 
  &quot;Ouch, I suppose I deserved that after I 
hurled on you, my fine whippet friend.&quot; Rei said 
with a grin. 
  &quot;Oooo, I forgot about that. And no, you 
deserve to be hurled on back with the same 
vigor.&quot; She said, as she smacked Rei again.
  &quot;I will trust you, though, with my most 
closely guarded secret. If we are really meant 
to be together, there should not be any secrets 
between us. You may decide I&#39;m more trouble than 
I&#39;m worth! 
  You see, the ginsuishou literally feeds off my 
energy to protect me, Rei. It&#39;s an intimate, 
symbiotic part of me, and it&#39;s thankfully my 
burden alone. 
  Without it, I wouldn&#39;t last long, and 
conversely without me, it wouldn&#39;t last long. 
Without food, neither of us would survive. 
Mother called it the crystal sickness.&quot; 
  Rei paused briefly in her attempt to put her 
tight khaki Capri&#39;s on in mid hop. She stared at 
Usagi aghast. 
  &quot;Kami, Usa. You mean, what I did foolishly to 
myself yesterday, would have killed you?&quot;
  &quot;Probably.&quot; Usagi smiled, while she fixed her 
hair into odangos. 
  &quot;Well, I&#39;m done. Thank you for lending me some 
of your clothes. Let&#39;s eat!&quot; 
  She whooshed past Rei and out the door. 
  Rei was left behind, and stood with her pants 
around her thighs, her mouth in an &#39;O&#39;.
                                             
                   * * *
  Rei arrived in the kitchen in time to see 
Usagi smack Grandpa&#39;s sneaky hand away from her 
cleaned vegetables. Rei looked surprised at the 
array of food. 
  &quot;When did you buy that?&quot; Rei asked curiously.
  Usagi raised her eyebrows quizzically at her 
now perfectly manicured friend. 
  &quot;Oh, I flew magically to the store and 
bartered the family heirloom for them, having no 
money to pay. I was given some magic beans to 
throw out the window... Grandpa, was that the 
last of my magic beans?&quot; 
  Rei&#39;s face began to turn interesting shades of 
red. 
  Usagi almost lost it. 
  &quot;While you gave yourself a pedicure no one 
will ever see, a garden suddenly sprang up, and 
I toiled in the sultry sun to bring my mistress 
and task master this sumptuous bounty.&quot; She 
expounded with a flourish as she displayed her 
handiwork. 
  Usagi grabbed a tissue, sneezed and blew her 
nose. It was a great final effect. 
  Rei looked at her in surprise, and ignored the 
exaggerations.
  &quot;You had time to pick peppers, cherry 
tomatoes, and Romaine? It would have taken 
Yuuichiro all afternoon to pick that between 
rounds of whiskey and lousy songs.&quot; 
  Usagi&#39;s eyes twinkled.    
  &quot;Yes, oh wise, omniscient, and most imperious 
Mistress of the Shrine. And there&#39;s more, much 
more, grasshoppah. Look in fridge crispah! You 
too, can know what it means to &#39;work hard and 
eat hearty&#39;. Old Chinese proverb I just made 
up.&quot; Usagi replied out loud in a sing-song 
voice. Inside, she was secretly happy the 
whiskey had not been Grandpa&#39;s... he wouldn&#39;t 
miss it.
  Rei seemed like she grew fangs suddenly... 
imperious?
  Grandpa was going to hurt himself laughing at 
Rei&#39;s expense. 
  Usagi began barking orders. 
  &quot;Come on Rei, help me chop this stuff up for a 
salad, you&#39;re good with knives! Grandpa, do you 
have some yogurt? Get the left over salmon out 
of the fridge, while you&#39;re there. Rei, we&#39;ll 
have to hurry if we want to make it to class on 
time, so chop, chop!&quot; 
  Hurricane Usagi had arrived. 
  Rei was amazed at how much like Mrs. Tsukino, 
Usagi had become.
  &quot;So, Miss Gorge Yourself with Junk &#39;Till Your 
Teeth Rot, since when has a healthy diet become 
a part of your life?&quot; Rei asked, as she daintily 
placed more salmon into her mouth. 
  Usagi tapped Rei&#39;s tea cup, to urge her to 
drink more of the special brew. When Rei 
complied, she answered her.
  &quot;Since my track coach practically moved in to 
make sure I ate right. My ice skating coach was 
right there behind him. I just couldn&#39;t hide 
anymore and slowly succumbed to their madness. 
  Now I&#39;m insane.&quot; She said as she wiggled her 
eyebrows and rapidly blinked one eye. 
  &quot;Honestly, I&#39;m grateful. I generally feel 
better, have a lot more energy, and have greater 
endurance while I perform.&quot; Sotto voce she added 
to Rei, &quot;I can&#39;t wait to show you!&quot; 
  Louder she remarked, &quot;You should try it, 
Microwave Queen.&quot; 
  Usagi wadded more salad into her mouth. 
  &quot;Well, the food may have improved, but not the 
manner in which it&#39;s eaten.&quot; Rei said and 
pointed at the lettuce that still dangled from 
Usagi&#39;s delicious lips, &quot;and it doesn&#39;t look to 
me like you feel better!&quot; She said and indicated 
the garbage full of tissues. 
  Usagi issued her challenge with a glare. It 
would be a long life together. 
  Rei stood as the phone rang. But pointed at 
Usagi and quipped as she left... 
  &quot;Get thee to a piggery, thou slob!&quot;
  Rei answered the phone and gleefully knew she 
had gotten the last word in. 
  Then the words &#39;neat freak&#39; reached her ears. 
  &quot;Hmphh!&quot;
  &quot;Moshimoshi. Hikawa Jinja, Hino Rei 
speaking... yes, she um, confided in me. I trust 
that you can help her, and keep confidentiality 
a priority. Umm, Hmm... Oh, that&#39;s perfect, 
thank you so much! I&#39;ll see to it she&#39;s there. 
Konnichiha.&quot; Rei hung up and turned towards 
Usagi who had already cleaned off the table. 
  &quot;Usa, you&#39;re on for 4:30 this afternoon.&quot; Rei 
called out, as she grabbed her backpack and gym 
bag then headed for the door.
  &quot;Hey, wait for me!&quot; Usagi huffed, and grabbed 
her backpack and her &#39;new&#39; guitar.
  &quot;Usa, isn&#39;t that... Grandpa&#39;s guitar?&quot; Rei 
asked suspiciously.
  &quot;Nope, he gave it to me as a gift. 
It&#39;s mine... all mine!&quot; Usagi clutched the case 
to her chest and hugged it.
  She is so cute! Rei thought as they reached 
the Jinja arches at the top of the steps. Rei 
turned to Usagi.
  &quot;Would you like for me to come with you, or do 
you want to go alone to your appointment?&quot;
  Usagi arched an eyebrow at her, but answered 
seriously.
  &quot;Rei, you know I want you with me. I&#39;m afraid 
of what she&#39;ll say to me... and do to me. 
  But don&#39;t you have lacrosse practice until 
5:00? I can&#39;t ask you to hold my hand and shirk 
off your responsibilities! We&#39;ve already missed 
enough classes and practices because of youma, 
and no matter how smart we are, or how athletic 
we are, it isn&#39;t a good idea to skip. 
  I can&#39;t believe I just said that! I sound like 
Ami and Mom.&quot; 
  Usagi hung her head sadly. She peeked at Rei 
covertly, and flashed her teeth impishly. 
  &quot;If we don&#39;t speed up we&#39;re going to miss our 
1:00 classes! Race ya!&quot; 
  The girls started their rapid descent down the 
eighty something steps lined by multi-colored 
autumn trees.
  &quot;Usa, I appreciate what you are trying to 
say,&quot; Rei began, and sped up to catch up with 
her friend. She wondered how her friend could 
run two miles with a guitar... &quot;but in the realm 
of things, what happens to you effects all of us 
in a way. Your need comes first this time, ok?&quot; 
  Rei finished softly. 
  &quot;I want to be there for you the way you were 
for me. 
  Ugh, Usagi, could you please slow down... it&#39;s 
too hot and muggy to rush! I&#39;m not exactly at 
100 percent, right now, and neither are you. 
This Fall weather is like a yo-yo!&quot; 
  They had arrived at the dragon and deer 
statues at the bottom of the steps and entered 
the courtyard. 
  Usagi finally paid attention to her companion 
and glanced at her. She suddenly realized that 
Rei had consumed mostly liquids and had eaten 
only a little food. She probably had not 
replaced nearly as much as she had lost over the 
last 24 hours. She was flushed and sweat 
profusely. 
  Oops. 
  &quot;Maybe you should stay home today, Rei. I 
think you are fighting more than a binge. You 
look like you are about to stroke. Do you want 
some of my water?&quot; Usagi asked and handed her a 
water bottle.
  &quot;Thank you, Mommy. I&#39;ll be alright as soon as 
I&#39;m inside and can sit... you don&#39;t need to fuss 
over me!&quot; Rei exclaimed in exasperation. 
  The girls decided on a slow jog and arrived at 
their respective 1:00 classes a few minutes 
early. 
  Usagi went to Professor Shimi&#39;s Creative 
writing class, and slid into an empty seat next 
to Michiru and in front of Mina. 
  Rei went to Professor Ippongi&#39;s Religious 
history class... alone. Professor Ippongi was 
also Rei&#39;s lacrosse coach and he smiled 
pleasantly at her. She was an excellent student, 
and a great athlete.
  Usagi cornered the music teacher, Professor 
Kiremono, a couple minutes before class started 
at 2:00 and showed him Grandpa&#39;s guitar. She 
wanted to know where she could go to get it 
restored, and he obliged her happily. 
  Usagi sat between Makoto and Haruka. Behind 
her was Rei, flanked by Michiru, Ami, and 
Mamoru.
  Haruka leaned in close to Usagi. 
  &quot;Are you taking in homeless guitars now, 
Sensei Odango?&quot; She asked Usagi and pointed at 
the dilapidated old guitar case.
  Usagi leaned close to Haruka and indignantly 
answered her. 
  &quot;This happens to be a 1960&#39;s vintage Sakurai 
Kohno, and it is priceless to me! I mean to have 
it restored, and then play it!&quot; 
She retorted as she blew her nose.
  When music class adjourned, Ami and Michiru 
went to report to coach Iruka for swim team 
practice. Makoto and Rei went to Prof. Ippongi&#39;s 
lacrosse practice, Usagi and Haruka to coach 
Kennin&#39;s cross-country practice. Mamoru left to 
join Motoki for soccer practice.
  Usagi was glad when Coach Kennin let her go 
early at 4:00 from cross-country practice so she 
could keep her appointment. 
  She hadn&#39;t done very well. Coach Kennin had 
incorporated Fartlek into their long distance 
regimen to stimulate their fast twitch muscle 
fibers. 
  Usagi found it curiously difficult to breathe, 
and needed to cough after the speedplay portions 
of the Fartlek training. 
  Coach Kennin had been all over her. 
  Usagi wearily found a stall to herself and 
showered quickly, then headed dejectedly on foot 
for Dr. Wakai&#39;s office. 
  Where were the stupid youma when you needed 
them!
