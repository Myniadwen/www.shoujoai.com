<p>As it circled above and prepared for landing, a long range shuttle flew low over the Lunar plain.</p>
<p>Its  two occupants gazed down at a makeshift sparring arena where two  figures – a golden warrior and a crimson warrior – circled each other.  Their closely choreographed movements could have been preemptive of a  sparring session or a dance. At their altitude, it was hard to  determine.</p>
<p>“Ara, Minako and the new one, too?” A petite, aqua haired woman asked.</p>
<p>A tall woman with short, sandy hair snorted. “Just like Ami and Makoto.”</p>
<p>“Just like you and me you mean?“</p>
<p>“Do you think its coincidence, Michiru?”</p>
<p>The aqua haired woman smiled. “No more so than you and I.”</p>
<p>The  white noise of the shuttle almost drowned the tall woman’s quietly  spoken words. “These girls don’t need men or families to compete with  their duty to the Princess.”</p>
<p>“Saa.”</p>
<p>“And no one is better suited to understanding the hardships of being a senshi than another senshi.”</p>
<p>“You’re being incredibly deep today.”</p>
<p>“Am I?” She rested her chin in her hand thoughtfully. “Seeing Serenity must bring it out in me.”</p>
<p>“Maa.”  The more introspective of the two wasn’t the only one apt to retreating  into her own world at times. She’d have to remind her partner of this  fact when she was in a more receptive mood. The slightest touch of her  hand on the other woman’s knee snapped the blonde back to her attention.</p>
<p>“Haruka?”</p>
<p>“Hn?”</p>
<p>“Take it easy on them. Especially the little Venusian.”</p>
<p>“I’ll try.” A coy smirk tugged at Haruka’s lips. “But they need to be toughened up. Her especially.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  grassy plain where they had laid in each other’s arms some days ago  soon doubled as a sparring area. Venus had desperately needed to blow  off some steam, and so the Venusian and the Martian found themselves  circling each other slowly.
<p>“Why do these ‘outers’ bother you so much?” Mars demanded. “You’ve been on edge since news of their arrival.”</p>
<p>Venus  attacked, raising her blade and whirling her body sideways in an act  more for form than function. Their blades met and the golden warrior  launched an offensive; a series of quick, short thrusts that Mars had  to parry in double time until she managed to catch Venus’ blade with  the hilt of her weapon, their strengths matched as they pushed against  each other evenly.</p>
<p>Cerulean eyes hardened. “We don’t <em>need</em> them. We could have dealt with this threat on our own. What have we been training for, if not for this?”</p>
<p>“But  I thought the youma invasion extended into their outer territories as  well. Doesn’t it make sense to combine forces with more warriors?”</p>
<p>Venus’  strength faltered in the slightest. Mars seized the opportunity and  pressed the advantage, pushing the Venusian away from her and releasing  a subdued burning mandala which the golden warrior dodged with a  backwards roll before launching herself back to her feet.</p>
<p>“Life doesn’t always work that way. Egos get in the way.” A sphere of light illuminated Venus’ hands.</p>
<p>“Yours?” Mars asked with a raised eyebrow.</p>
<p>The  golden warrior frowned and the crimson warrior dodged her crescent  beam. Venus called another into existence. “You’re just as bad as <em>she</em> is.” She scolded.</p>
<p>“Then this Haruka person shouldn’t be so hard for to deal with, now should she?” Mars smirked.</p>
<p>The  Venusian’s offensive stance slipped. An epiphany. She smirked. Her  crescent beam winked out of existence. But she wouldn’t let Mars known  she’d won that point.</p>
<p>She charged the Martian, her sword raised, instead. Their blades clashed and Mars pressed the offensive, driving Venus back.</p>
<p>“It’s my bet that Queen Serenity called the outers here to aid in whatever hair brained, reckless scheme <em>you’ve</em> come up with regarding Serenity’s visit to Earth.”</p>
<p>“Well now, aren’t you just the regular detective?”</p>
<p>“You didn’t name me your second in command for nothing.”</p>
<p>Venus  snorted and attempted a leg sweep, which Mars hopped over easily. The  second in command position that had been open all along had been  filled. And she’d had just about enough of her second in command’s  insubordination. A slow, mischievous smile tugged at her lips. Her love  me chain materialized in her gloved hands with a golden glow.</p>
<p>Mars’ eyes narrowed expectantly.</p>
<p>The chain shot through the air.</p>
<p>Mars jumped back, but not far enough.</p>
<p>The  weapon she’d seen effortlessly decapitate so many youma gently wrapped  around her waist in a feather-light grip. The crimson warrior didn’t  falter. Her hands wrapped around the restraint. The senshi of love and  the senshi of passion stared at each other.</p>
<p>With a mighty pull,  Mars used her leader’s weapon to her advantage and the Venusian  stumbled forward. Mars caught her and wrestled Venus to the ground,  pinning her in a move she’d executed more than once against her.</p>
<p>“Sometimes  I wonder who’s the stronger of the two of us.” Venus said distractedly  as she ran her fingers through the other woman’s raven hair.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I wonder why you let me win.”</p>
<p>“Maa,” Venus said with a smile, “I wonder.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Haruka stood an entire foot taller than Minako.
<p>Only she could pull off such a feat as to maintain a powerful sense  of manliness and confidence while still remaining utterly feminine. It  was that awe inspiring respect she seemed to demand that simultaneously  drew the inner senshi to her and yet pushed them away.</p>
<p>“We answer  Queen Serenity’s call.” She barked. “We will fight alongside your  warriors, but we resent the fact that you could not contain the threat  within your territory of the inner solar system.”</p>
<p>Though the  circumstances were far beyond her control, Minako hung her head, for  she had no recourse to the allegations. In a sense, she <em>had</em> failed in her duty.</p>
<p>She  felt Rei’s glare, that gaze that nearly burned a hole through her. She  chanced a glance at angry amethyst eyes that seemed to say, <em>‘You wouldn’t take this crap from </em>me<em>, so suck it up!’</em></p>
<p>The  leader of the inner senshi straightened and drew a deep breath. She had  to be the stronger woman, but ignoring Haruka’s bait, she knew, would  prove difficult.</p>
<p>“We have less than a week to devise a plan to  deal with the Earth. I suggest that we work together on a strategy to  address the enemy that threatens all our planets.”</p>
<p>This seemed to  deflate the proud Uranian somewhat. She looked to her graceful  companion who nodded her head slightly. Following Michiru’s lead,  Haruka conceded. Following Minako, she took a seat at a long table with  the rest of the inner senshi.</p>
<p>Michiru steepled her fingers and  crossed her legs beneath the table. “What exactly are we dealing with?  We’ve read the report on your rather… unfortunate meeting with Earth’s  leaders, but are still at a loss. Who, or what, is controlling the  youma?”</p>
<p>Rei’s lips seemed to move of her own accord. It was a  conclusion that hit her as Michiru spoke, and her revelation felt so  right that it caught her off guard. “The human unrest is the driving  force behind the youma.”</p>
<p>Michiru leaned forward with no small  amount of interest. “You’re implying that the physical manifestation of  a peoples’ fear and mistrust is being fed on by an entity with a power  capable of controlling the youma.”</p>
<p>The senshi known for her  sensing abilities and the senshi known for her intuition leveled  understanding stares at each other that spoke volumes.</p>
<p>Finally  Haruka snorted. She pushed her frame into the back of her chair and  crossed her arms over her chest. “What kind of ridiculous concept is  that?”</p>
<p>“A very valid one.” Michiru said demurely.</p>
<p>The  senshi of wind ignored her partner, too wrapped up in her power  struggle. She turned to the Venusian. “What kind of crap have you been  feeding the newbie over here, Venus?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t expect someone like <em>you</em> to understand it.” Minako said offhandedly. She hadn’t yet heard Rei’s  hypothesis, but her past experience assured her that the extra sensory  Priestess had sharp aim in such subjects, not to mention that Rei had  garnered Michiru’s agreement, a feat not so easily accomplished.</p>
<p>“Someone like <em>me</em>, koneko-chan? I’d take a good, hard look in the mirror before slinging allegations like that one around.”</p>
<p>Rei  sensed the flare in Minako’s aura. Not wanting her leader to loose her  cool, she laid a warning hand on the other woman’s elbow.</p>
<p>Realizing  that she was loosing ground, Haruka unleashed her aggression on Rei.  “And you, newcomer. Do you protect Princess Serenity, or are you just  here as Minako’s bitch?”</p>
<p>Refusing to take the bait, no matter how tempting, Rei narrowed her eyes. “Screw off.”</p>
<p>The  Uranian seemed to recoil at the younger woman who seemed so impervious  to her intimidation tactics and her hazel eyes narrowed when she saw  the Venusian feed off that energy.</p>
<p>The leader of Serenity’s guard  smirked. “She’s no more my bitch than Michiru-san is yours. After all,  we all know who wears the pants in <em>that</em> relationship.”</p>
<p>Haruka’s  jaw clenched. Her hand balled into a fist and cocked behind her.  Michiru’s light touch disarmed her from doing something she’d  doubtlessly regret afterward.</p>
<p>But it was Serenity who brought the uncomfortable argument to an undisputable end.</p>
<p>Her  chair screeched across the marble floor and the Princess of the Moon  Kingdom stood hurriedly. Her golden bangs masking her tear filled eyes,  her hands balled into white knuckled fists. “Please stop.” Her voice  was a whisper. “Fighting amongst each other will get us nowhere. Its  times like this where we need to work together.”</p>
<p>She sniffled quietly. “You’re <em>all</em> senshi, aren’t you?” Watery blue eyes implored each woman sitting around her table. “We all have the same goal, don’t we?”</p>
<p>The  reprimand was akin to being splashed in the face with ice water, and  not one of the senshi dared make eye contact with another for fear of  seeing their Princess’ reproach in each other’s doleful eyes.</p>
<p>Michiru smiled sweetly and arched a delicate, aqua eyebrow. “I think we’re all going to get along just <em>fine</em>. Aren’t we, Haruka?”</p>
<p>The  sandy haired woman smirked and cracked her knuckles, relieved that her  confident display brought forth a small smile on Serenity’s face. “I  guess in the end it doesn’t matter. All I need to know is that we have  an enemy to face. That’s enough for me.”</p>
<p>The Princess’ small smile disappeared. “But we still don’t know who that enemy is.”</p>
<p>“Koneko-chan…”  Haruka began softly. Her words died on her tongue when none of the  other women would meet her gaze. Talk of the Earth, apparently, was off  limits.</p>
<p>Michiru’s hands steepled together in front of her. “It sounds like there’s no strategy <em>to</em> devise. All we can do right now is sit and wait.”</p>
<p>The others nodded silently, obviously displeased with the only logical conclusion.</p>
<p>Haruka sighed. “And Serenity is due to head to Earth in five days to begin diplomatic talks with their leaders?”</p>
<p>“Serenity’s not going to Earth.”</p>
<p>All eyes turned to the leader of the inner senshi. Minako smirked. “<em>I’m</em> going in her place.”</p>
<p>“Mina-chan!” Serenity’s cry was a reproachful protest. “This is <em>my</em> duty as Princess!”</p>
<p>The  Venusian smiled softly at her charge; despite the angry expression on  Serenity’s face, she was doing what she knew was best for her Princess.  “I can’t allow you to travel into hostile territory, and with only one  senshi as protection. You should have known as much.”</p>
<p>“Well, you <em>are</em> a dead ringer for Serenity-chan.” Ami said thoughtfully, looking for  any distraction to pull their Princess out of her upset state. Damage  control could be taken care of later, after all. And by the looks of  things, she knew that Makoto, who had been tensely silent throughout  the meeting, would also need some tending to.</p>
<p>The Venusian smirked. “Hmm. I don’t know if that’s an insult or a compliment, Ami-chan.”</p>
<p>Serenity had the decency to feign insult. “Mina-chan!”</p>
<p>“And your aide? Who will you choose to accompany you?” Michiru asked.</p>
<p>All eyes turned to Rei expectantly.</p>
<p>The Martian rolled her eyes. “Oh, <em>wonderful</em>.”</p>
<p>Haruka snickered and leaned towards Minako. “Are you <em>sure</em> she’s not your bitch?”</p>
<p>This time, it was Minako that had to keep Rei from leaping across the table at the Uranian.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Stay here. I’ll go ahead to our suite.”
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“Makoto.” The Neptunian stated simply without breaking pace. “She’s been following us since we left the meeting.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Haruka  stopped and watched Michiru’s graceful form until she disappeared  through the Palace’s side door. Finally, she uttered a long-suffering  sigh and turned to what only appeared to be an empty courtyard.</p>
<p>“Come out, Makoto. I know you’re there.”</p>
<p>Fists clenched, the Jovian stepped out from behind a large tree, failing at the casual nature she struggled to project.</p>
<p>“I  felt your glare on me through the whole meeting.” Haruka said.  “Surprised your little leader didn’t put up more of a fight against me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe she’s grown weak.” Makoto growled.</p>
<p>Haruka arched an eyebrow. “Maybe she’s grown <em>up</em>.”</p>
<p>Makoto  snarled. The airwaves around her distorted with a deep, green glow.  Jupiter stood tall in Makoto’s wake. “Shut up and fight me.”</p>
<p>The  Uranian shrugged. Jupiter was just like her, and as she suspected, just  like their new Martian friend, as well; they were cut from the same  cloth and their war-like instincts would guide them in matters such as  these.</p>
<p>‘<em>So be it.’ </em></p>
<p>In the space of time it took  Haruka to smirk resignedly, she was enveloped in a golden glow. Uranus  stood before Jupiter proudly.</p>
<p>The Jovian charged, her halberd  aiming straight for the Uranian’s chest. A jewel encrusted sword  blocked the blow and sent the long range weapon clattering to the  ground. A roundhouse kick to Jupiter’s chest sent the brunette  sprawling to the ground after it and Uranus kicked the halberd out of  her reach.</p>
<p>Jupiter spat the dirt from her mouth and raised her torso on shaky arms. “I’m tired of not being strong enough compared to you.”</p>
<p>“Then stop comparing yourself to me and set your own standards.”</p>
<p>Jupiter  looked up to those plainly spoken words, which, in the heat of her  frustration would not sink in to her subconscious until the Jovian’s  rage had subsided.</p>
<p>“Don’t take it so personally. I’m here to make you stronger, not make you feel bad about yourself.”</p>
<p>“Could’a  fooled me.” The senshi of lightening wiped the corner of her mouth with  an arm before leaping backwards and to her feet, affecting a defensive  stance.</p>
<p>Uranus sheathed her sword. She rushed forward and met the  woman in hand to hand combat – the preferred style for both their  warring nations.</p>
<p>It didn’t last long. The Jovian’s punches and  kicks, strong and fast though they were, were blocked by the Uranian.  Ones that were stronger and faster were delivered and Jupiter found  herself being pushed back. She was loosing ground. She was loosing  stamina.</p>
<p>She was simply loosing.</p>
<p>Uranus lunged forward,  grabbed Jupiter by the collar of her fuku, and pulled mightily. The  Jovian was granted a very detailed view of the starry sky as her world  was turned upside down. Her back hit the paver ground and the air was  forced from her lungs.</p>
<p>The courtyard was silent, yet her ears rang with defeat.</p>
<p>A  gentle fizzle in the air heralded a detransformation, and Haruka turned  her back and wordlessly departed. There was nothing she could possibly  say. The words she’d spoken earlier would still take a while to sink  in. Besides, she noted, as she watched a small blunette rushing into  the courtyard, she knew damage control was already on her way.</p>
<p>Drawn  up on her knees, her fists clenched, the defeated woman pounded the  hard pavers. She heard the Palace door shut with a click of finality  but she was only alone in the courtyard for so long. Ami paused a fair  distance away from her.</p>
<p>The brunette scowled at her lover’s  arrival. Pity would do her no good in this state. She turned her head  sharply. “Please don’t.”</p>
<p>She saw the soft, blue glow through  tightly clenched eyelids. Jupiter opened wide eyes to find Mercury  frowning at her. The Mercurian’s brow furrowed. Gloved hands rose to  her chest. Jupiter had to press herself to the pavers to avoid the  blast of a no-nonsense shabon spray.</p>
<p>Mercury eyed Jupiter  expectantly. She cocked her hands to prepare another attack. “If you  want to get stronger, you’ll have to get up and fight, Mako.”</p>
<p>A slow smirk tugged at Jupiter’s lips. She raised her aching body off the ground, and summoned the lightening.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Paperwork, paperwork, paperwork.
<p>Minako filed the last of her reports and sat back in her chair with  a contented sigh. That contentment faded all too soon as a tall blonde  shouldered her way into her office. Haruka slammed the door shut behind  her and pulled the chair opposite Minako away from the desk. Spinning  the chair, she sat on it backwards, long legs sprawled on either side  of it’s back.</p>
<p>The Uranian propped her elbows on the chair’s back and leaned forward with a coy smirk. “So tell me, Minako-<em>chan</em>, you’d fall for a Martian but not a Uranian?”</p>
<p>“You tell <em>me</em>,” the Venusian crossed her arms over her chest, “does Michiru-san know what a cur you are?”</p>
<p>“She sure does.” Haruka laid on a flattering smile.</p>
<p>“You’re so insincere.”</p>
<p>“Only with everyone <em>else</em>, koneko-chan.”</p>
<p>“Cut the crap and tell me what you want, Haruka-san.”</p>
<p>The sandy haired blonde’s cocky smirk slipped into a frown. “You only have two days left. Are you ready for your decoy mission?”</p>
<p>“<em>Decoy</em> makes it sound so dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Maybe you should pull your head out of your ass and think twice about what you’re walking into.”</p>
<p>Minako’s lips pursed into a fine, white line. “I’m as ready as I’m going to be.”</p>
<p>Haruka nodded and a degree of seriousness was lifted. “And the Princess. Has she forgiven you?”</p>
<p>“Not…  exactly. She’s still rather upset, but she’ll just have to deal with  the disappointment. We can’t risk her safety. She’ll have to wait to  see Endymion some other time.”</p>
<p>“Ah. So <em>that’s</em> what this is about.”</p>
<p>Minako nodded.</p>
<p>“Hmm. So you <em>have</em> grown up, to be able to disregard Serenity’s whims.”</p>
<p>“Keh.” The Venusian cursed at the Uranian’s condescending attitude, although this <em>was</em> the nicest she’d ever known Haruka to be. Somehow, Minako had the growing suspicion that she was being <em>coached</em>.</p>
<p>“And what of Mars? Are you sure she won’t distract you from your mission?”</p>
<p>“Never.”  Minako’s response was curt, her eyes hard. It was something unspoken,  but understood. Duty was paramount to everything else. It was a fact  each senshi was all too aware of, not least of all Haruka herself.</p>
<p>“I  understand you and this Beryl woman didn’t exactly hit it off. Will you  be able to maintain your cool while keeping up the disguise of  Serenity?”</p>
<p>“Pfft. Better than you ever could, you hot head.”</p>
<p>Haruka leaned back, a smile on her lips. “Touché, Venus, touché.”</p>
<p>The  Venusian stood, her chair sliding across the floor dismissively.  “Really, if you’re done with your little game of twenty questions, I  have more pressing matters to attend to.”</p>
<p>“Like Rei?”</p>
<p>Minako gathered a few belongings in her arms. She paused at the door and returned Haruka’s smirk evenly. “Yes. Like Rei.”</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
There was something primally alluring about seeing the Martian on a motorbike.
<p>Long, raven hair tied into a low ponytail at the nape of her neck,  Mars straddled the dangerous machine with a commanding ease. Maybe it  was the bike. Maybe it was Mars. Maybe it was just the difference of  being near the fire senshi while she was in her civilian form, but  Minako felt overwhelmed by the other woman.</p>
<p>“<em>She</em> talked to you, didn’t she?” Mars asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>What Minako had really meant to say was, <em>‘Do you see through me so easily?’</em> But she already knew too well this woman’s power over her. She didn’t need it voiced.</p>
<p>“And?”</p>
<p>Minako flashed a “v” with two fingers at her second in command. “Maybe Haruka’s not so bad after all.”</p>
<p>Mars only rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>The  Venusian sidled up to Mars’ side. The bike clinked and ticked, and heat  waves rolled off the exposed engine, indicative that the Priestess had  already given it a thorough workout.</p>
<p>“Patrol duty? On this thing?”</p>
<p>“What,” Mars frowned, “did you think the only thing I could drive was a pony?”</p>
<p>“Touché, but, these things <em>are</em> pretty primitive. I guess it suits you. So scoot over.”</p>
<p>Mars stiffened. “Eh?”</p>
<p>Just  as she had ridden behind the Martian warrior on her stout pony what  seemed like ages ago, but was really more like weeks, Minako placed her  hands on the Martian’s shoulders and swung a leg over the bike’s seat,  sliding her body tightly against the crimson warrior’s. “Show me why  you like this dangerous thing.”</p>
<p>“You sure?” Mars felt the nod behind her head. The bike came to life with a roar. “You ready?” She called.</p>
<p>“I’m holding on, aren’t I?”</p>
<p>The  Martian smirked. With a flick of her wrist, the bike lunged forward,  and Minako’s casual devil-may-care hold around her waist tightened into  a death grip as the bike sped away from the small town that skirted the  Moon Palace and headed for the Lunar plains beyond, kicking up a faint  trail of dust as it went.</p>
<p>Mars handled the machine like she did  everything else - with reckless abandon. But despite the speed and wild  maneuvers she made, Minako felt a smile on her face that hadn’t been  rivaled in as long as she could remember.</p>
<p>“The speed and the wind  in your hair are great, but I think I know why you really like these  bikes.” The screaming wind threatened to steal Minako’s words had her  lips not been pressed firmly against Mars’ ear. The crimson warrior  repressed a shudder and chose not to ask. She knew the answer would be  forthcoming.</p>
<p>It just hadn’t been in the form she’d expected.</p>
<p>Minako’s fingernails gently raked against Mars’ inner thigh. “Because it feels good right about <em>here</em>.”</p>
<p>Long fingers danced underneath the hem of the Martian’s red skirt and the bike faltered, wobbling from side to side dangerously.</p>
<p>Under  white gloves, Mars’ fists were white knuckled as she regained control  of her bike. The Venusian’s laughter was music in her ears.</p>
<p>“Very  funny.” Mars barked, though the effect of her sarcasm was diminished by  the laughter that laced her voice. “You know, I’ll get you back for  that.”</p>
<p>“I’m counting on it.” Minako purred.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Personal guard duty of Princess Serenity was a task the Martian was still trying to adjust to.
<p>Perhaps it wasn’t so much the guarding, as it was the tea parties.  She’d never heard of a bodyguard drinking tea from delicate cups and  eating small cakes while keeping watch of her charge. But for the woman  across the table from her, Mars would endure the breech in protocol.</p>
<p>“Do  you know what its like to be separated from the one you… care strongly  for?” Serenity’s last three words were quickly reconsidered as a blush  tinged her cheeks.</p>
<p>Mars opened her mouth. It clicked shut  promptly. All of her life she’d been alone, but now, she found that the  answer she had been so accustomed to providing no longer held true. And  now that she <em>did</em> have someone she… <em>cared strongly for</em>… she couldn’t imagine having to be away from her.</p>
<p>Minako.</p>
<p>She was suddenly very relieved to be accompanying the Venusian on this dangerous mission, even if she <em>was</em> relegated to the cover of an aide.</p>
<p>“Moon to Rei-chan?” Serenity giggled at her joke.</p>
<p>“Princess,  I…” Mars stopped and considered her words carefully. A small smile  touched her lips and her amethyst eyes softened. “You’ll see your  Prince again soon. Of this, I am certain.”</p>
<p>Mars chanced a glance at her chronometer. Serenity’s smile only widened.</p>
<p>“Tomorrow’s the big day, ne?”</p>
<p>Mars only nodded, her mind a million miles away.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps you should go get ready for your trip to Earth. I’m sure Minako’s waiting for you.”</p>
<p>Mars rose. When her Princess pulled her into a friendly embrace, she didn’t pull away.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Despite  their relationship that had grown in leaps and bounds, she’d been in  this place only once before, when she’d deposited a drunken Minako on  her bed before taking her leave.
<p>This time, she wasn’t so sure that she’d be leaving.</p>
<p>Rei and  Minako lay on that very bed, a tangled mass of limbs and hair. Heavy  petting had nearly devolved into something… more, when the Venusian  halted her worship of Rei’s body.</p>
<p>“Are we weak to hide from the growing problem like this?”</p>
<p>“If  this is weakness,” Rei said as her lips picked up Minako’s slack,  laying a kiss to the exposed skin above the other woman’s breast, “I  don’t mind it nearly as much as I thought I would.”</p>
<p>“You’re bad.” Minako scolded weakly.</p>
<p>Rei  propped herself up an elbow. “I’m a realist, Minako. A warrior has to  have more than just duty, even a leader. Don’t you agree? Or are you  really just looking for an excuse to distance yourself and play the  martyr again?”</p>
<p>“No.” Minako insisted abruptly. “I’m <em>not</em> running away.”</p>
<p>She  paused. She was caught in the depths of those amethyst orbs. She knew  her explanation had been enough for the Martian, but it wasn’t enough  for <em>her</em>. Minako’s heart spoke without her brain’s permission, and the sentiment slipped out-</p>
<p>“I love you, Rei.”</p>
<p>“Mina…”  The name was breathless. The Priestess regarded the woman underneath  her blankly for a moment. Love was a Venusian concept. What she felt,  she was sure, was deeper, and she returned the Martian equivalent.</p>
<p>“I need you more than the air that I breathe.”</p>
<p>Minako smiled knowingly, and Rei claimed those pink lips eagerly.</p>
<p>Their  first coupling would be not unlike their first meeting on that  barbarian planet. Somewhat tentative, yet entirely passionate - both as  willing to take as much as to give. On the Martian’s part, it would be  possessive, raw and powerful. On the Venusian’s part, it would be  loving and the joy of giving and the pleasure of taking.</p>
<p>Rei’s  nails danced along Minako’s ribcage. Her fingers slid across the gentle  hollow of her stomach before meeting the sharp rise of a hipbone. They  trailed up the graceful contour of her leg and then across to the  quivering muscles of Minako’s inner thigh before gently cupping her  hand around the woman’s most sensitive spot.</p>
<p>Amethyst eyes sought cerulean.</p>
<p>“Rei… please…”</p>
<p>And she did.</p>

Author’s Notes:
<p>Okay, so, not only did I cop out on the ending, I used the dreaded “L” word that I <em>hate</em> using. I’d like to think I balanced it though, with Rei’s response. I just… felt it needed it. Gah, don’t kill me.</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>For  a little something special, here’s a stupid omake that I really wished  I could have squeezed in, but just didn’t have the guts to:</p>
<p>Makoto propped herself up on an elbow. “Ami, what is it?”</p>
<p>“I  just remembered, I have to give Mina-chan these files for her to read.  They should prove useful since she’s not too familiar with Earth  customs. I’ll be right back”</p>
<p>Makoto shrugged as Ami dashed from their suite.</p>
<p>Only then did she remember, <em>‘isn’t Rei-san’s shift over by now?’ </em></p>
<p>The  blunette returned shortly thereafter. Ami shut the door behind her  haltingly and then pressed her back against it. Her crimson blush was  telling, but Makoto was still compelled to ask.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t know… that two women could achieve that position.”</p>
<p>Makoto fought back a chuckle. “Maybe they could teach us a thing or two, ne?”</p>
<p>Ami’s blush reached new heights. “Makoto!”</p>
<p>OOO</p>
<p>Preview: Chapter 10: Substitute Serenity</p>
<p>There was an urgent beep at the breakfast table.</p>
<p>Four  sets of curious eyes scanned the room. Serenity fidgeted and did her  best to discreetly glance at the device clasped in her hands under the  table’s edge.</p>
<p>Haruka, Michiru, Ami, and Makoto exchanged  suspicious glances that were confirmed by their Princess’ sudden gasp.  Watery, blue eyes beseeched her guardians.</p>
<p>“Endymion…” there was a pregnant pause, “he’s going to meet <em>Serenity</em> in her chambers.”</p>
<p>“Eh!?”</p>
<p>The  Princess of the Moon found her four guardians instantly surrounding  her. Makoto pulled her chair away from the table as though she weighed  nothing. Haruka snatched the small object from her palm. She paled at  the text message meant for the Princess’ eyes only.</p>
<p>“You should have told us about this.” The Uranian scolded sharply.</p>
<p>“This isn’t the time for arguments!” Ami snapped.</p>
<p>Serenity snatched the device back quickly. Haruka didn’t put up a fight.</p>
<p>“We have to alert Minako.” Michiru urged.</p>
<p>Makoto was already on it. Her hand held before her, her chronometer blinked to no avail. “Why won’t they answer!?”</p>
<p>“You tried them both?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>An uncomfortable silence rested heavily on their shoulders.</p>
<p>Michiru’s arms settled across her chest. “We’ll just have to trust that they’ll be able to keep up the façade.”</p>
<p>A fork skirted the edge of a porcelain plate and worried eyes caught worried gazes.</p>
