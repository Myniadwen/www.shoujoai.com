----------------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka didn&#39;t bother to move as the three Inner Queens reached the room, 
hands covering their mouths in shock.  Setsuna appeared behind them, 
shaking her head.  Then their daughters, dressed in whatever they had 
thrown on when they heard Shousha&#39;s voice in the small meeting room, 
appeared behind them.  Rei and Minako chuckled, not surprised at how 
Haruka&#39;s secret had been revealed, and Makoto pulled Ami away, desperate 
to escape before her mother shook free of the shock.
 
Michiru opened her eyes.  &quot;Hello, Mother.  Did you want something?&quot;
 
&quot;How long have you known?&quot;
 
Michiru shrugged.  &quot;Since the night before you ordered Haruka to marry 
me.  She was getting ready to leave, and I couldn&#39;t let her go without 
spending one night in her arms.&quot;
 
&quot;That was your storm.  Michiru, why would you disobey me?&quot;
 
&quot;We were only following your orders,&quot; Haruka countered, her soft voice 
reminding Shousha of her lost lover.  &quot;I would never have dared this, no 
matter how much I love Michiru, if not for your command.&quot;
 
&quot;Yoruno Kiyoshi knew?  He went to Earth willingly to perform the 
ceremony?&quot;
 
That news shocked the queens.  They would never have contemplated a trip 
to Earth for any reason, yet these two young princesses had gone there 
and married.  Meika noticed her daughter just then, and her glare 
stopped the pair in their tracks.  &quot;You knew.&quot;
 
&quot;We were invited,&quot; Makoto shrugged.  &quot;All of the Senshi were there.  
Including Setsuna-san.&quot;
 
Setsuna shrugged at the shock in her friends&#39; eyes.  &quot;I was too late to 
stop them, and destiny has shown me that she wants these two together.  
The world of the future will fall without their union, though I have no 
idea why.&quot;
 
&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter!  You two are princesses!  You cannot be married.&quot;
 
Narrowing her eyes, Haruka pulled her tunic off the nearby chair and 
slipping it on, sliding out of bed.  &quot;Just because you didn&#39;t have the 
courage to marry my mother does not mean that Michiru and I cannot be 
together.  Destiny needs a bonding of Kaiousei and Ten&#39;ousei, and we are 
not afraid to indulge her.&quot;  She slipped her pants on and crossed her 
arms over her chest.  Without the vest, outer tunic, and cape, Haruka 
looked much more feminine.
 
&quot;Courage has nothing to do with it!  Kazeko and I were very much in 
love, but we were smart enough to preserve our kingdoms.&quot;
 
&quot;And yet when she did what she was supposed to, when she got pregnant, 
you turned away from her.&quot;
 
Silence.  Shousha, fury in her blue eyes, clenched her fists.  &quot;I did 
not turn away from her.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes you did, even though she was nothing but supportive when you 
conceived and lost your son.  You refused to see her, to speak to her, 
until the day I was born.  The day you lost her.&quot;
 
&quot;And I&#39;ve hated you ever since,&quot; Shousha hissed, more powerful the more 
Haruka&#39;s words cut her.  &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for you, she would never have 
died and I would never have lost her.&quot;
 
&quot;She died because she gave up!  She died because she thought you hated 
her.  She went into labor and there was no one there to hold her hand, 
to love her and her child.  Where were you when she needed you most?&quot;
 
&quot;I came!  I was there!&quot;
 
&quot;You didn&#39;t come until Serenity sent the massage to the Moon that Kazeko 
might die.  Then you realized that you would be alone, and you finally 
showed up!  How selfish.  If anyone killed my mother, it was you.&quot;
 
That accusation hung in the air, quivering in the charged atmosphere.  
Michiru pulled her bed dress on and joined her wife, taking her arm for 
support.  &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; Shousha whispered, an instant from tears.  
&quot;It&#39;s not my fault.&quot;
 
&quot;Whose fault is it, then?&quot;
 
&quot;No one&#39;s.  Nobody could have saved her.&quot;
 
&quot;Just as nobody could have killed her.&quot;  As Haruka&#39;s words sank in, 
Shousha&#39;s deep blue eyes widened.
 
&quot;Nobody killed her,&quot; Shousha whispered.  &quot;I didn&#39;t kill her, Serenity 
didn&#39;t kill her . . . you didn&#39;t kill her.  Just like Hakuchou and 
Kaichou could never have killed their mother.&quot;
 
Haruka&#39;s gaze softened.  &quot;You lost a lover that day, a soulmate, they 
lost a partner, Father lost a wife, my kingdom lost a queen, the Silver 
Millennium lost Sailor Uranus, and I lost my mother.  Do you understand?  
I lost my mother.&quot;
 
Shousha nodded, wiping the tears from her cheeks.  &quot;Then all these 
years, I only blamed you because I still blamed myself.  No one could 
have saved Kazeko, no matter how much we loved her.  It was her time to 
go.  It was her destiny.&quot;
 
Haruka wrapped her arm around Michiru&#39;s waist.  &quot;And this is our 
destiny.  Nothing happens without reason; Kazeko&#39;s death was planned and 
required, even as our marriage was planned and required.  There is 
something we will do together to save the future world.&quot;
 
&quot;If they are kept apart,&quot; Setsuna whispered, &quot;the future world will 
never exist.&quot;
 
Shousha reached her arms out to the two women, eyes pleading.  &quot;Forgive 
me, please.  I didn&#39;t know.&quot;
 
Haruka took her mother-in-law&#39;s arms and smiled.  The brilliance in the 
young woman&#39;s eyes reminded Shousha of her lost lover, and she 
swallowed.  &quot;I am a lot like her, Shousha-san.  I know you see that.  
And I want to preserve my kingdom as much as she did, but, unlike her, 
my destiny is to surrender to my love, to marry Michiru.  It will all 
make sense one day, and I hope you will be supportive of me and 
Michiru.&quot;
 
&quot;I am, Haruka-kun.  I know Kazeko would be proud of you.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled Michiru into her arms again and bowed to the other queens.  
&quot;We didn&#39;t want to lie to you guys, but we had to keep this a secret.  
Thank you, Setsuna-san, for not telling anyone what happened on Earth.&quot;
 
Setsuna bowed her head, dark green hair falling over her shoulders.  &quot;I 
keep my promises, Haruka-san.  Always.  Now, I suggest you get some 
rest&#151;&quot; and she stressed that word to the other queens&#39; amusement 
&quot;&#151;before you have to go tell your father what you did.&quot;
 
Haruka&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;I forgot about that.  How mad will he be?&quot; 
 
The Space Sword, resting calmly on Michiru&#39;s dresser, glowed.  &#39;He&#39;ll be 
mad at first, but he&#39;ll get over it.  He always will.&#39;  A tall, 
blonde-haired spirit appeared in front of the group of queens, brilliant 
emerald eyes shining in the dim light.  She wore the navy and gold 
Sailor fuku of Sailor Uranus, though not exactly the same as the fuku 
her daughter wore.  Kazeko smiled and reached her arms out to her 
partners and lover.  &quot;Hello, Shousha.  How have you been?&quot;
 
&quot;Kazeko,&quot; Shousha whispered, reaching her hand out.  &quot;Moons of Neptune, 
how are you here?&quot;
 
Kazeko pointed at the sword and henshin stick on the dresser.  &quot;I hid in 
them until my daughter would take her place as Sailor Uranus.  Now that 
she has her necklace, I can walk about a bit.  I visited your dreams 
earlier, if you remember.&quot;
 
&quot;My dreams?  That was you?&quot;  Shousha touched the apparition&#39;s cheek, 
surprised to find warm flesh beneath her fingers.  &quot;I&#39;m so lonely, 
Kazeko.&quot;
 
The spirit embraced Shousha, kissing her forehead.  &quot;We&#39;ll be together 
again some day.  For now, your dreams will do.&quot;  Kazeko&#39;s spirit slipped 
into Shousha&#39;s body, and the sapphire-haired woman collapsed, 
unconscious.
 
Haruka laughed as she easily lifted the queen, gesturing for the queens 
and senshi to retire to their rooms.  &quot;She&#39;ll be busy for a while.  We 
can all return to our beds now.&quot;  Haruka carried her mother-in-law into 
her bedroom while the women dispersed, laying the dreaming queen in her 
bed and pulling the blue-aqua-white blanket over Shousha.  Smiling at 
the sleeping Queen of Kaiousei, the blonde senshi turned to return to 
her room.
 
Michiru was standing right behind her, staring at her mother.  &quot;She&#39;s so 
peaceful, Haruka, so happy.  I&#39;ve never seen her so happy.&quot;
 
Haruka looked at the queen and smiled.  &quot;She shouldn&#39;t push people away 
like she does.  She never lets anybody get close to her.  I don&#39;t blame 
her, but . . .&quot;
 
&quot;Thank you, Haruka.&quot;
 
Confused, Haruka looked back at her wife, catching the image of Kazeko&#39;s 
spirit as it passed through Michiru&#39;s mind.  &quot;Kazeko?  She chose to hide 
in the sword.  It wasn&#39;t my idea.&quot;
 
&quot;It was your love and your courage that let her out to see my mother,&quot; 
Michiru whispered, deep blue eyes full of tears as she looked up.  &quot;You 
made her so happy.&quot;
 
&quot;I guess it&#39;s my job to take care of this family,&quot; Haruka whispered, 
wrapping her arms around Michiru.  &quot;Let&#39;s go back to bed; my mother will 
take care of yours.&quot;  Secure in Haruka&#39;s arms, the aqua-haired princess 
let her lover lead her back to their room.
 
Kazan, alerted by the commotion coming from Michiru&#39;s room, watched the 
pair return to their bedroom, eyes wide.  Haruka was most definitely not 
a man.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;That&#39;s not possible.  Shousha-san would not let a woman marry her only 
daughter.&quot;  Akaneiro glared at his son, daring the boy to dispute his 
words.
 
&quot;Father, I know what I saw.  Men don&#39;t have breasts.&quot;
 
Akaneiro rolled his eyes, ignoring his son for a moment while he 
concentrated on his breakfast.  &quot;Haruka-kun is a very nice young man and 
it&#39;s not nice of you to call him a woman.  If he was a woman, would he 
say &#39;boku&#39;?  Trust me one this once.  In any case, it&#39;s not a prince&#39;s 
job to question the actions of the current and future queens of a 
different planet.  What happens on Kaiousei concerns the royal family, 
the queens, and the senshi.  No one else.&quot;
 
&quot;Meanwhile,&quot; Momoiro interrupted gently, &quot;Where&#39;s Mother?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I guess she&#39;s with her queen friends.  She hasn&#39;t seen 
them in a while and I want her to be happy.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll bet Mother knows that Haruka-kun is a woman.  All of the queens 
were gathered around Michiru-san&#39;s room last night right before I saw 
Haruka-kun carry Shousha-sama to her room and take Michiru-san back to 
theirs.  Without that vest and outer tunic, Urakaze Haruka really did 
look like a woman.&quot;
 
Akaneiro shook his head.  &quot;Your curiosity and stubbornness are not good 
or useful traits in a mere prince, but I suppose a little research 
wouldn&#39;t hurt.  Okay, I&#39;ll make you a deal.  Stop harping on this and go 
search the archives for a picture of Urakaze Haruka from Ten&#39;ousei&#39;s 
files.  That&#39;ll tell us the truth.&quot;
 
Kazan nodded.  &quot;Very well.&quot;  His meal finished, Kazan excused himself 
and went to discover the truth of Urakaze Haruka&#39;s identity.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;There must be something!  The Moon Archive lacks nothing!&quot;
 
The servant on the other end sadly shook his head.  &quot;Forgive me, 
Hino-sama.  There is nothing.&quot;
 
Kazan rubbed his eyes wearily.  &quot;Okay.  Then pull up the marriage file 
for Urakaze Haruka and Kaiou Michiru.&quot;  The controller touched a few 
buttons on his console, and the file appeared in the air before the 
young prince, floating mockingly.  Nothing.  The file showed that no 
marriage for Urakaze Haruka of Ten&#39;ousei was ever recorded.  &quot;Not 
possible.  They are married, the priest said so.  Wait, I know.  Pull up 
all information you have on Yoruno Kiyoshi, Priest of the Order of the 
Winds of Ten&#39;ousei, Oshou of the Ten&#39;ou no Utsukushii no Uta Temple.&quot;
 
&quot;Yoruno Kiyoshi has performed literally hundreds of weddings, Hino-sama.  
Do you only want his recent activity?&quot;
 
&quot;Very well.&quot;  A list replaced the empty marriage file for Urakaze 
Haruka, and Kazan glanced at the entries.  &quot;They&#39;re not here.  What&#39;s 
this?&quot;  He pointed to a gap filling the last week, ending the day before 
when the priest appeared at Kaiou Michiru&#39;s birthday party.
 
&quot;It seems that the Oshou asked for some free time for prayer and 
solitary reflection.&quot;
 
&quot;And?&quot;
 
&quot;And . . . here.  He left Ten&#39;ousei for Mokusei that afternoon.&quot;
 
Kazan touched the transport file and keyed in a request for all 
transport files concerning the same old priest.  There were many.  &quot;He 
was busy!  Look at this!  He went to Mokusei, Kasei, the Moon, back to 
Kasei, Kinsei, Mokusei, Suisei, and finally back to Ten&#39;ousei the 
morning before Michiru-san&#39;s birthday.  A little past midday yesterday, 
he was called to Kaiousei for the party, then he went home.  This list 
of activities does not seem to indicate a week of solitary prayer.  He 
was on a mission, but what?  What did he do?&quot;
 
&quot;Should I check the records of the planets?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  See who else showed up around the same time he did.&quot;
 
A list of visitors to the planets appeared beside Yoruno Kiyoshi&#39;s 
activity log, the computer highlighting and deleting name after name 
until the new list was gone.  &quot;Nothing was recorded of the same guests 
at any two planets.&quot;
 
Kazan thought a moment.  &quot;Bring up the logs of the Inner Princesses.&quot;
 
Shrugging, having missed the intellectual leap the prince made, the 
controller brought up the files.  &quot;Look here, Hino-sama.  It seems that 
Minako-hime, Rei-hime, Makoto-hime, and Ami-hime were all on the Moon 
about a week ago, and Queen Serenity entertained two unknown guests.  It 
seems that she had two guests rooms prepared for some reason.  The 
people aren&#39;t listed, but their descriptions match a pair seen on 
Mokusei, Kinsei, Kasei, and Suisei the same time Yoruno Kiyoshi was 
there.&quot;
 
&quot;Do any of the other kingdoms record names?&quot;
 
&quot;Um, Mokusei&#39;s records list Kaiou Michiru and Urakaze Haruka as guests.  
Hmm, look at this.  This was not Urakaze-sama&#39;s first visit to Mokusei.&quot;  
The list of Urakaze Haruka&#39;s activities over the past few months flashed 
into existence, and Kazan raised an eyebrow.
 
&quot;Kasei, Mokusei, the Moon, then Kaiousei, and there is no official 
transport record for him.  So how did he move from one place to another 
so easily?&quot;
 
The controller pushed a button, and the events listed moved into 
chronological order.  &quot;First Urakaze Haruka appeared on Kasei and 
trained Rei-hime for a while.  Then he went to Mokusei and trained 
Makoto-hime.  While he was there, one of the servants filed a report of 
a sighting of Ten&#39;ou Kazeko&#39;s spirit in the communications and archive 
room.  He then visited the Moon and apparently left in quite a hurry, 
appearing on Kaiousei and saving Michiru-hime&#39;s life the same day he was 
recorded on the Moon.  Then he and Michiru-hime left Kaiousei, and 
Yoruno-san left Ten&#39;ou no Utsukushii Uta Temple the same day.  He was 
later recorded on Kasei and Mokusei, the day before all of the princess 
appeared on the Moon.  Then this Urakaze Haruka, Kaiou Michiru, Hino 
Rei, Kino Makoto, Aino Minako, Mizuno Ami, and Yoruno Kiyoshi went to 
Kasei.  Yoruno Kiyoshi then accompanied Hino-sama and Aino-sama to 
Kinsei.  He traveled to Mokusei, where Urakaze Haruka confronted King 
Meisha and Queen Meika.  Yoruno Kiyoshi, Kino-sama, Mizuno-sama, 
Kaiou-sama, and Urakaze-sama then traveled to Suisei, where Kino-sama 
and Mizuno-sama remained.  Urakaze-sama and Kaiou-sama then returned to 
Kaiousei and Yoruno Kiyoshi went back to his temple.&quot;
 
Kazan nodded.  &quot;So, sometime during that whirlwind of traveling, those 
two married.  But none of the Inner Planets record the wedding?&quot;
 
&quot;No, Hino-sama.&quot;
 
Lost, Kazan pulled up a map of the Inner Planets, pushing the 
holographic chronological list of events to one side for the moment.  He 
drew a path with his finger, leaving behind a pale pink line indicating 
Kiyoshi&#39;s path.  He then drew in Urakaze Haruka&#39;s path in white.  &quot;They 
had to get married here, where the paths are one.  But Haruka-kun was 
never seen while the priest was on Mokusei and Kasei.  Only on and after 
the Moon.  I guess my sister and her friends would be there as 
witnesses, so Michiru-san must have gotten married here, on the Moon.&quot;
 
&quot;We have no record, Hino-sama.  I checked personally.&quot;
 
Kazan nodded, eyes moving away from the tiny white pearl that 
represented the Moon, and his eyes stopped.  &quot;No,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;It 
can&#39;t be.  They wouldn&#39;t have married on Earth unless they had something 
to hide.  When did Urakaze Haruka first appear?  What other news passed 
between the planets that day?&quot;
 
The controller pulled up a list, deleting the trivial ones.  &quot;Oh, look 
at that.  Ten&#39;ou-sama sent a message to all of the kingdoms recording 
the kidnapping of his daughter that day.  She, the Space Sword, and 
Uranus&#39;s henshin stick all vanished.&quot;
 
Kazan shrugged and reached to change the story, then something deep in 
his memory clicked.  &quot;The Space Sword?  Computer, picture.&quot;  He stared 
at the image floating in front of him.  &quot;Bring up pictures of Urakaze 
Haruka from the party today.&quot;  He skipped until he could see the 
beautiful sword hanging from the Duke&#39;s waist.  &quot;That sword!  Is he the 
one that stole it?&quot;
 
&quot;Ah, here&#39;s a picture.  This is Ten&#39;ou-sama&#39;s daughter, Ten&#39;ou Haruka.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka?&quot;  Kazan looked at the picture and fell back.  &quot;Urakaze Haruka 
didn&#39;t steal the Space Sword because it belongs to her.  To Ten&#39;ou 
Haruka.&quot;  He touched the screen, and a file appeared in front of him, 
listing two marriages that Yoruno Kiyoshi performed, each stamped with 
the exact same time; Kaiou Michiru to an unnamed groom and Ten&#39;ou Haruka 
to another unnamed groom.  &quot;He married them.  Ten&#39;ou Haruka married 
Kaiou Michiru.&quot;  The controller&#39;s eyes widened, but he was wise enough 
not to say anything.
 
The connection was suddenly severed.
 
Kazan looked over his shoulder as Shousha entered the room, hands on her 
hips.  The servant bowed quickly and left, knowing without having to be 
told that he was not to discuss any of Kazan&#39;s findings.  &quot;So you know.  
Congratulations; it took me a week after meeting her to discover the 
truth about Haruka-kun.&quot;
 
&quot;You know?&quot;
 
&quot;We all know, Kazan-kun.  All of the queens.  I made the connection last 
night while we were discussing how our daughters seem to be attracted to 
each other.  Your mother mentioned that if Michiru was attracted to 
women, she&#39;d probably fall for Kazeko&#39;s daughter.  That was when I made 
the connection between the names.  Haruka is a woman, but it doesn&#39;t 
bother me.&quot;
 
&quot;I thought you hated Ten&#39;ou Kazeko&#39;s daughter.&quot;
 
Shousha smiled and shook her head.  &quot;Not anymore.  Are you going to tell 
anybody?&quot;
 
&quot;I should tell my Father.&quot;
 
&quot;He knows by now.  All of the kings know.  So do Makoto-san&#39;s brothers, 
actually, and Amami&#39;s twin daughters.  Now you know and Momoiro-san 
will, too.  There is no secret to tell anymore.&quot;
 
Kazan stood up and looked at the queen.  &quot;You seem different, 
Shousha-san.  What happened to you last night?&quot;
 
Shousha blushed as she shooed the prince out.  &quot;Go talk to your father; 
I need to call Serenity.&quot;  When the boy was gone, Shousha sat down in 
front of the console and dialed Serenity&#39;s personal code.  The Queen of 
the Silver Millennium was quick to answer.
 
&quot;Shou-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;Hello, Serenity.  How have you been?  Had any interesting visitors on 
the Moon lately?&quot;
 
Serenity raised one eyebrow.  &quot;What are you getting at?&quot;
 
&quot;Visitors.  You could have mentioned that my daughter was on the Moon.  
With the person she just married.&quot;
 
&quot;I didn&#39;t think to call you, Shou-chan&#151;wait.  Married?  She wasn&#39;t here 
with that duke&#39;s son you told me about.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?  I&#39;m sure she was.  Where did he say he came from?  Uranus?  I 
think his family was Urakaze.&quot;
 
Serenity narrowed her eyes for a moment, then she gasped.  &quot;Shou-chan!  
Urakaze Haruka . . . you know.  You already know.  Are you telling me 
that Michiru married Ten&#39;ou Haruka?&quot;
 
Shousha began to laugh, her free hair tickling her face and neck at the 
unexpected movement.  &quot;Yes, Kazeko&#39;s daughter is now married to and 
sleeping with mine and I&#39;m happy for them.  It was never my fault or 
your fault that Kazeko didn&#39;t live, and it was never Haruka&#39;s fault that 
she died.  Haruka-kun told me that when I caught them, and I discovered 
something else.&quot;  Serenity, at a complete loss for words, raised an 
eyebrow.  &quot;Kazeko was in that damn sword, Serenity.  She was there all 
along.  And when you gave the necklace to Haruka-kun, she gained the 
ability to leave the sword for long periods of time.  She joined me in 
my dreams last night.  I actually held Kazeko again, and it&#39;s all thanks 
to Michiru and Haruka breaking the rules.&quot;
 
Serenity leaned back in her chair, remembering Michiru and Haruka&#39;s 
visit to the Moon.  &quot;I thought there was something going on between them 
when they were on the Moon.  The night they spent here, one of my 
servants was cleaning in the hallway and swears that there were two 
people in Haruka-kun&#39;s room, and there were noises.  The poor servant 
was too embarrassed to tell me what noises he heard, but if they were 
married, I know what they were up to.  I ignored him, but I guess he was 
right.  Serenity discovered that Urakaze Haruka was just a disguise for 
our missing Uranian Princess, and I figured it out after that huge fight 
I had with Haruka-kun before she left the Moon.  I guess she went to 
Kaiousei after that.  When did you first meet her?&quot;
 
&quot;It was much later.  Apparently she appeared the same morning I left for 
Ten&#39;ousei.  It was the anniversary of her death.  I guess I never 
thought about it, but Haruka-kun&#39;s birthday passed while she was on 
Kaiousei, and she never said anything to anybody.  I didn&#39;t come back 
for more than a month.  That was about a week ago.&quot;
 
&quot;You thought she was a man?&quot;
 
Shousha nodded.  &quot;Yeah.&quot;  She laughed lightly, remembering the morning 
after she returned.  &quot;They made quite a storm that night, Serenity.  I 
watched that hurricane brewing all night and I just couldn&#39;t figure out 
who was making it.  I remembered my nights with Kazeko . . . I didn&#39;t 
think about it again until just now.  They were so powerful, Serenity.  
The next morning, when I caught her in Michiru&#39;s room, I reacted 
automatically.  I ordered them to marry.&quot;
 
Serenity chuckled.  &quot;You ordered them to marry?&quot;
 
Shousha nodded.  &quot;Haruka-kun pointed that out while we were arguing.  
She had a good point, I have to admit.&quot;
 
&quot;Where were they married, Shou-chan?&quot;
 
&quot;On Earth.&quot;
 
Serenity stared at Shousha.  &quot;Wait a second.  Earth?  When was this?&quot;
 
&quot;When Haruka-kun and Michiru returned to the Moon.  A priest named 
Yoruno Kiyoshi was there with them.&quot;
 
&quot;Who else?&quot;
 
Shousha shrugged, wondering where the conversation was leading.  &quot;Makoto 
said that all of the Senshi were there.&quot;
 
&quot;All?  Do you think Serenity was there?  Oh . . . Haruka-kun and 
Michiru-san took her into the city that day, and the guard fell asleep . 
. . Shou-chan, my daughter went back to Earth!&quot;
 
&quot;And?&quot;
 
&quot;Did you know she was at Michiru-san&#39;s party last night?  She and that 
Earth prince she&#39;s been visiting?&quot;
 
Shousha shook her head.  &quot;Serenity, don&#39;t fight this.  Let your daughter 
be happy.&quot;
 
&quot;I can&#39;t let her keep going to Earth.  He&#39;ll die soon and she&#39;ll be 
alone again.  She doesn&#39;t need that pain.&quot;
 
&quot;Like she doesn&#39;t need to be Sailor Moon?&quot;
 
Serenity stared at the other queen.  &quot;Shou-chan.  I&#39;m surprised at you.  
You&#39;ve changed a lot.  I guess Kazeko had quite an influence on you.&quot;  
She turned to one of her servants and murmured an order, turning back to 
the screen when he left.  &quot;As much as the marriage of two noble women 
goes against the laws and traditions of the Silver Millennium, 
especially two senshi, that&#39;s not as bad as one of us with a prince of 
Earth.  He won&#39;t live long enough to giver her heirs, and I won&#39;t have 
her heart broken.&quot;  The servant returned, and Shousha watched him bow 
nervously to his queen in the background, muttering something.  
&quot;Serenity&#39;s vanished again?&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s not going to stop leaving, Serenity.&quot;
 
The silver-haired queen looked at her friend.  &quot;Shou-chan, she doesn&#39;t 
listen to me.  Right now I don&#39;t think she even likes me.  If she&#39;s on 
Earth, I can&#39;t get to her.  There is unrest on that planet, and the Moon 
Queen would be an easy target for the rebels.  Serenity isn&#39;t safe, 
either, but Setsuna doesn&#39;t worry much about her visiting, so I know 
she&#39;s safe enough.  But I can&#39;t let her stay.  Only one person has ever 
been able to bring her back.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-kun.  Of course.  Look, when they wake up, I&#39;ll suggest that 
Haruka-kun and Michiru take a trip to Earth before heading for 
Ten&#39;ousei.  Be patient, old friend.  She&#39;ll fix everything; it&#39;s what 
she does.&quot;</pre>
