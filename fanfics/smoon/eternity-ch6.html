<h1>Eternity (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eternity-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>A few weeks later, Michiru was frantically cleaning the already spotless 
kitchen. Haruka came downstairs with the vacuum cleaner and put it back 
in the closet.

&quot;Haruka!&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;Open the downstairs windows,&quot; Michiru ordered briskly. &quot;She&#39;ll be here 
any minute.&quot;

Haruka had to smile as she went about her assigned task.

The doorbell rang and Michiru raced to it. She and Setsuna embraced like 
long lost siblings. Eventually, Setsuna turned to Haruka and they 
playfully tried to squeeze the breath out of each other. When she pulled 
back, Haruka was surprised to see the garnet-eyed woman quickly wipe a 
few tears away.

&quot;Come in! Come in!&quot; Michiru waved their guest fully into the house. Her 
long dark green hair brushed the floor as Setsuna pulled on a pair of 
slippers.

Haruka picked up her best friend&#39;s bags and carried them into one of 
their guestrooms.

Michiru linked her arm with Setsuna&#39;s and they went into the kitchen.

&quot;Would you like some tea?&quot;

Michiru set a plate of cakes out.

&quot;Hotaru couldn&#39;t make it,&quot; Setsuna said softly.

Michiru&#39;s blue eyes filled with disappointment. &quot;I know. She called 
yesterday. I was hoping, but . . . &quot; She sighed. Haruka lay a comforting 
hand on her wife&#39;s shoulder.

Setsuna was running a slender finger around the gold edge of her teacup.

&quot;This looks almost like your old Royal Doulton pattern.&quot;

Michiru brightened. &quot;I know. Aren&#39;t they beautiful?&quot;

Setsuna grinned. &quot; I hope you have a few spares.&quot;

&quot;Oi.&quot; Haruka recalled the mess of broken shards they&#39;d come home to that 
sweltering summer afternoon. &quot;Hotaru broke those and that antique vase 
in the foyer.&quot;

Michiru shrugged. &quot;Children need things to occupy them or accidents can 
happen.&quot;

&quot;Have you looked at any schools yet?&quot; Setsuna inquired.

&quot;Why would we do that?&quot; Haruka replied. &quot;The baby&#39;s not even born yet. 
She won&#39;t be ready for school for at least five years.&quot;

&quot;Some of the better schools have waiting lists that long.&quot;

&quot;Masaka.&quot; Michiru&#39;s eyes went wide at this lapse in their planning.

Haruka could almost see the gears working as her wife made plans to 
start calling potential schools as soon as possible. The blonde wasn&#39;t 
worried. As a senshi, even a retired one, she was sure that a few words 
in the right ear and they would have schools calling them.

The doorbell rang.

&quot;I&#39;ll get it&quot; Haruka offered and pushed off from the doorway where she&#39;d 
been leaning.

&quot;More company?&quot; Setsuna&#39;s eyes were teasing.

&quot;We weren&#39;t expecting anyone.&quot; Michiru frowned.

&quot;Michiru. Michi-ru!&quot; The soft call followed by a shout alarmed the 
violinist. She surged to her feet heading for the entryway with Setsuna 
at her heels.

Haruka was fiercely hugging a slight figure.

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Michiru&#39;s gasped delightedly. Michiru and Setsuna embraced 
their daughter as if trying to squeeze the life out of the young woman. 
Haruka then took delight in ruffling Hotaru&#39;s hair.

&quot;Just wait until I get my growth spurt,&quot; the dark-haired woman groused, 
trying to comb the fluffed strands back into place.

Setsuna and Haruka exchanged grins.

&quot;I think it&#39;s time you gave up on that,&quot; the blonde teased.

&quot;I guess I got my height from Michiru-mama.&quot; Hotaru smiled.

The violinist laughed softly and wrapped her arms around the girl. 
&quot;Hai.&quot;

They stayed up long into the night remembering old times. Hotaru&#39;s 
favorite memory was when Makoto had finally settled down. She had been 
the first senshi to ask for a leave of absence so she could start a 
family. She had received more than she had bargained for though when the 
queen had released her from duty on a permanent basis. The excited young 
woman had shown up with a lace trimmed, ruffled fuchsia dress and had 
asked Uranus to be a bridesmaid. The blonde&#39;s face had remained neutral 
but the horror in her rapidly blinking eyes gave her away. Neptune and 
Saturn had doubled over in silent laughter behind her and Pluto had lost 
it then, choking and causing the tea she had been drinking to come out 
of her nose. They had all dissolved into laughter, though Uranus&#39; had a 
slightly relieved tone to it as Makoto assured her she&#39;d only been 
joking.

The next day Hotaru and Haruka made plans to go out and find something 
to do while Setsuna and Michiru embarked on a marathon-shopping spree 
for baby items.

&quot;Look at this.&quot; Setsuna held up a tiny pink outfit with lace around the 
collar.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful!&quot; Michiru exclaimed.

&quot;Haruka will hate it.&quot; She grinned, adding it to the little pile of 
things they had already gathered.

Their next stop was for the real reason they were out: maternity 
clothes. Michiru&#39;s estimated due date was sometime in the spring so they 
spent the afternoon trying on various outfits. One of their favorites 
was a white sleeveless top with a black and white ribbon that ran just 
over where her tummy would be. Setsuna, ever the fashion conscious one, 
helped her put together several chic outfits for later pregnancy.

The two stopped mid-afternoon to have tea and a snack. Setsuna looked at 
her friend with serious eyes.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Michiru set her glass back down from where she had been 
about to take a sip.

Setsuna smiled. &quot;Nothing. I was told to ask you something.&quot;

The violinist nodded slowly.

&quot;Do you want to have a baby shower?&quot;

The aqua haired woman let out a slow breath. She&#39;d had the fleeting 
thought that perhaps Haruka would be called back to duty without her.

&quot;We seem to have everything we need and then some.&quot; She smiled and 
gestured to the things they had bought.

&quot;Yes.&quot; The garnet-eyed woman nodded. &quot;But this isn&#39;t about needs. It&#39;s 
about spoiling.&quot;

&quot;The baby?&quot;

&quot;You and the baby.&quot;

Michiru giggled. &quot;All right, I&#39;m game.&quot;

&quot;Haruka is invited too.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#39;s just what she needs,&quot; Michiru said wryly.

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;More spoiling.&quot; The violinist grinned.

Setsuna laughed softly. &quot;Hai.&quot;

They returned home at almost four o&#39;clock and wrestled their packages 
into the house. It was then that fatigue hit Michiru.

&quot;Tired?&quot;

&quot;Hai. But I don&#39;t want to go to sleep and miss a minute of your visit.&quot; 
Setsuna smiled and patted her lap. Michiru drew her bare feet up onto 
the couch and lay her head on her friend&#39;s legs.

&quot;I had no idea,&quot; Michiru said drowsily as Setsuna gently ran her fingers 
through her hair.

&quot;Just be happy,&quot; her friend said with a smile.

&quot;I am,&quot; she whispered drowsily.

When Michiru awoke sometime later, Haruka was kneeling beside the low 
coffee table serving food from boxes onto the plate in front of her. She 
watched her wife deftly work the serving chopsticks. The wedding ring on 
her slender finger caught the light and Michiru felt a flush of emotion. 
It was a combination of joy, pride and attraction. When she saw Haruka 
and remembered their marriage, she couldn&#39;t control the warm rush of 
feeling.

Setsuna and Hotaru entered with glasses and a pitcher of ice water.

&quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot; Hotaru smiled at Michiru.

Haruka glanced up in surprise. The violinist smiled and slid off the 
couch to kneel on her side of the table. She lightly touched Haruka&#39;s 
arm, enjoying the warmth of her wife&#39;s skin through the sleeve. The 
blonde eased over so Michiru could reach the plate she&#39;d prepared for 
both of them. Michiru picked up a piece of tempura from their plate and 
took a delicate bite.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t sure what you wanted,&quot; Haruka confessed apologetically to her 
former housemates.

&quot;That&#39;s all right,&quot; Setsuna said, pulling her long, dark hair back. &quot;I 
prefer to serve myself.&quot; That was true since Setsuna was quite 
particular.

&quot;Everything!&quot; replied Hotaru blithely. Haruka smiled and prepared a 
plate for Hotaru while Setsuna made her own selections.

When dinner was finished, Setsuna and Michiru brought out their 
purchases to share with the rest of the family.

&quot;So much . . . pink.&quot; Haruka commented with mild distaste.

Setsuna threw a pillow at Haruka.

&quot;Be nice,&quot; she warned.

Hotaru was kneeling on the floor, pulling still more little outfits and 
blankets out of the bags. She was sorting them according to color and 
style. It was becoming apparent that the baby was going to be dressed 
all sorts of colors, yellows, light green, creams and blues.

&quot;Kawaii!&quot; she exclaimed.

Haruka picked up the buttery soft sleeper with ducks on it.

&quot;You had one like this,&quot; she commented to her daughter.

&quot;Hai, that&#39;s why we bought it.&quot; Setsuna nodded as she rose to her feet.

&quot;Bedtime?&quot; Hotaru asked.

The guardian of time stretched. &quot;No. No one go anywhere.&quot;

Haruka picked up a tiny pair of slippers. She set them next to Hotaru 
and put her fingers in the shoes to playfully kick at her daughter. 
Hotaru giggled and grabbed the blonde&#39;s wrist.

&quot;You two.&quot; Michiru laughed.

The racer was again surveying the pastel-draped floor.

&quot;Seriously, this reminds me of the time we went to Puroland.&quot;

Hotaru nodded her agreement as she thought of the Tokyo-based Sanrio 
theme park.

&quot;We spent hours looking for a Batz Maru plushie,&quot; Michiru remembered. 
&quot;You loved that character.&quot; Her voice turned nostalgic. Hotaru leaned 
her head against Michiru&#39;s leg while the violinist stroked the dark hair 
back from her child&#39;s face. Haruka had drawn one knee up and rested her 
chin on it, watching them with a bright look in her eyes.

&quot;You two are picture perfect,&quot; she murmured.

&quot;Ah. That was a very long time ago,&quot; Michiru commented and her own eyes 
shone at the memory.

Violet eyes looked curiously between her two parents. Hotaru recognized 
that there was an undercurrent to the exchange that she didn&#39;t 
understand.

Just then Setsuna came back from the kitchen with the bottle of wine 
she&#39;d brought.

She poured three glasses. &quot;None for you,&quot; she told Michiru with a wink.

Haruka moved to the couch and put her arm around Michiru. The violinist 
leaned back against Haruka&#39;s shoulder and looked up into her eyes.

&quot;Just a sip?&quot; she asked, batting her lashes.

Haruka surrendered her glass. Michiru took just enough to allow the 
flavor to explode on her tongue.

&quot;Mmm . . . I hope you have more of this,&quot; she commented. &quot;It&#39;s a good 
year.&quot;

Setsuna smiled mysteriously. &quot;I can get more.&quot; She raised her glass.

&quot;To family,&quot; she said with a warm smile.

&quot;Hai, to family,&quot; Michiru echoed.

Hotaru and Haruka touched their glasses to Setsuna&#39;s causing the high 
quality crystal to make a chiming sound.

The next morning Haruka woke up late. She really enjoyed sleeping in, 
although she was trying to break herself of the habit. She wandered down 
the hall to find everyone in the baby&#39;s room.

Looking chic in black pants and a lime green sleeveless top, Setsuna was 
cutting tags from baby clothes and handing them to Hotaru who was 
folding them. Michiru was deciding which drawers in the small baby 
wardrobe would be designated for booties, hats and onesies.

The senshi of Saturn, wearing a purple turtleneck with a purple and 
black plaid skirt, looked up and grinned when she saw Haruka&#39;s unruly 
blonde hair.

&quot;Ohayo,&quot; she teased, though it was almost noon.

Setsuna paused in her clipping to turn to the newcomer.

&quot;I hope the baby doesn&#39;t get your hair,&quot; she commented.

Haruka self-consciously smoothed her cowlick before her eyes took a 
playful gleam. &quot;She should be so lucky.&quot;

&quot;We saved some breakfast for you. It&#39;s in the fridge.&quot; Michiru told her 
mate.

&quot;I&#39;m good.&quot;

&quot;You need to eat something,&quot; Michiru scolded her lightly.

Setsuna grinned wolfishly at Haruka, knowing the blonde would soon be 
heading for the kitchen. Someone&#39;s stomach grumbled and three of the 
women looked around surprised. Michiru flushed.

&quot;Maybe I need to eat something.&quot;

Setsuna and Haruka exchanged glances and then burst into laughter. 
Hotaru went to Michiru and gave her a hug. &quot;Aww.&quot;

Haruka was still stifling chuckles as she offered Michiru her arm.

&quot;To breakfast m&#39;lady.&quot; The violinist smiled.

Setsuna was on her feet gathering up the neatly piled tags she&#39;d 
removed.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll just make lunch.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your vacation. You are not cooking!&quot; the aqua haired woman argued.

&quot;I can do it.&quot; Hotaru volunteered.

&quot;Now look.&quot; Michiru began. &quot;You two are our guests . . . &quot;

Haruka shrugged. &quot;I guess that leaves me. I think I saw some potted meat 
in the cabinet,&quot; the blonde mused.

Blue and garnet eyes wore identical horrified expressions.

&quot;Give up?&quot; Setsuna asked after several seconds.

Michiru looked down in surrender. &quot;Hai, give up.&quot;

In the end Setsuna made a delicious lunch for her family, but Haruka and 
Michiru insisted on doing the dishes.

&quot;I thought since it was their last night we could take them out to 
dinner,&quot; Michiru murmured to her wife.

&quot;That sounds good.&quot; Haruka took the wet dish Michiru offered her and 
began to dry it. &quot;Which restaurant?&quot;

The violinist was thoughtful. &quot;Let&#39;s let them choose, but we&#39;re paying.&quot; 
She shook a soapy finger at the blonde.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Haruka agreed easily.

&quot;We need to go back downtown. I think Hotaru would like to do a little 
shopping too.&quot;

&quot;Ok.&quot; Haruka didn&#39;t look overly enthusiastic but she didn&#39;t argue. &quot;Just 
let me catch a quick shower.&quot;

&quot;How quick do you want to make it?&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; It was a strange question and Haruka was confused.

Michiru smiled sweetly and gestured toward the soapy sink. The blonde 
choked on her incredulous laughter. &quot;Very funny. My wife the efficiency 
expert.&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; Michiru fluffed the sandy bangs with a damp hand.

&quot;I&#39;m going upstairs now to bathe.&quot; Haruka gave the aqua haired woman a 
kiss. &quot;In our shower, not our sink.&quot;

Michiru was giggling now. &quot;Fine, fine. Go.&quot;

Several hours later Haruka found herself downtown. Michiru had seen 
something the day before that she regretted not buying, so they had 
stopped to pick up the item. Haruka had opted to stand outside and 
people-watch rather than face the crush of shoppers inside. She was 
absently cataloguing the types of cars going by when she realized that 
someone was trying to get her attention.

&quot;Sir?&quot; A girl with auburn pigtails approached Haruka.

&quot;Yes?&quot; The blonde turned, surprised.

Another girl with raven hair pulled back in a ponytail joined the first 
and they smiled, slightly bouncing as they made their sales pitch.

&quot;We&#39;re cheerleaders from the Crystal Tokyo High School and we were 
wondering if you&#39;d like to buy a candy bar to support our squad.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s for a good cause!&quot; The other girl chimed in flashing a bright 
smile at the cute gentleman they had cornered.

Haruka returned the smile and was delighted to see she hadn&#39;t lost her 
charm as a glassy look appeared in the teenager&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Sweets from the sweet? How could I resist?&quot; she said smoothly, 
deepening her husky voice so that it almost purred. Haruka fished money 
out of her pocket and bought one of the bars.

One of the girls handed her the candy with a shaky hand.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; they chorused, still trying to calm their racing hearts.

&quot;You are very welcome, kittens.&quot; Haruka flashed a last melting smile and 
returned to the spot where she had been waiting for Michiru-tachi to 
return.

&quot;Pushover,&quot; Setsuna commented mildly as she appeared beside the blonde.

Haruka&#39;s grin was rakish. &quot;Hey, I support cheerleaders.&quot;

&quot;You must feel a special kinship because of the short skirts,&quot; the other 
woman observed tartly.

Haruka was working the wrapper off her bar and gave Setsuna a sweet 
smile. &quot;Not anymore . . . Puu.&quot;

The dark-haired senshi rolled her eyes.

Michiru and Hotaru rejoined them. The two had their arms linked 
companionably.

&quot;The true measure of strength is to break . . . &quot; Haruka grunted as she 
snapped the candy apart. &quot;...a chocolate bar into four pieces and then 
only eat one.&quot; Simultaneously, three hands shot out leaving the blonde 
with the smallest chunk.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll help you be strong,&quot; Hotaru said unrepentantly and 
winking she bit into the wedge she had just taken.

Michiru took pity on her wife and broke her own piece in half handing 
the rest to Haruka who looked at her questioningly.

&quot;Chocolate has too many preservatives,&quot; she explained.

&quot;Preservatives help you look younger,&quot; Setsuna shared after swallowing a 
mouthful of chocolate.

&quot;Meioh Setsuna: secrets revealed!&quot; Violet eyes were lit with amusement.

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; The garnet eyed woman exclaimed. &quot;Respect your elders!&quot;

The younger woman looked chastened and dropped her eyes. &quot;Hai, 
Obaa-san,&quot; she murmured.

Haruka nearly choked on her laughter and affectionately wrapped an arm 
around Hotaru&#39;s shoulder and squeezed. By this time Setsuna was laughing 
too, her hand pressed to her forehead.

&quot;All right, all right.&quot; Michiru restored order. &quot;Let&#39;s get to the 
restaurant before the dinner rush.&quot;

Following the enjoyable dinner was a tearful good-bye back at the house.

&quot;Don&#39;t forget to write.&quot; Setsuna sniffled.

&quot;And send care packages!&quot; Hotaru added quickly. Setsuna lightly elbowed 
her, but Michiru beamed, knowing that her efforts were appreciated.

Haruka helped them load their bags into Setsuna&#39;s rental car. Hotaru had 
taken a taxi to the house so the two senshi were returning to the palace 
together.

They hugged the two good-bye and then stood back. At first Haruka had 
her arms folded across her chest as Michiru was calling good-byes. Then 
the blonde moved forward and slid her arm around her wife. They waved 
until the car disappeared from sight.

Inside the house it was almost too quiet. No amount of music or 
television could mask the fact, so they went to bed early.</pre>
