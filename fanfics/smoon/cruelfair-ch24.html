<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 24 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/crawlspace.html">Crawlspace</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>	The house was large, granted, and there were times when Setsuna 
would come home and have to walk through several rooms before finding 
someone.  For it to take this long, however, was highly unusual, 
especially with everyone home and a guest present.  Her curiosity about 
it all rose significantly when she walked into one of the hallways and 
found Hotaru crouching on the floor, her ear pressed to a drinking 
glass against a closed door.  Setsuna crossed her arms over her chest 
and affected a somewhat sterner countenance.  Then she cleared her 
throat loudly enough for Hotaru to hear.
	The girl jumped and turned around quickly.  &#147;Setsuna-mama,&#148; she 
stammered out, trying to hide the glass behind her back.  Throwing on 
her best innocent smile, Hotaru continued rapidly, &#147;You&#146;re home.  Um, 
Haruka-papa told me to wait for you and tell you to come in here when 
you got back.  She wants to show you the videotape we got today of the 
man who was taking our picture at Mako-chan&#146;s.&#148;
	Setsuna lost the &#145;stern parent&#146; look and asked with some concern, 
&#147;You saw him again?&#148;
	Hotaru nodded.  &#147;On the TV with Rei&#146;s dad.  Haruka-papa says he 
works for him, that&#146;s why he was there.  Then they took the tape in the 
room with them and wouldn&#146;t let me in.  It&#146;s not fair, Setsuna-mama.  
I&#146;m the one who saw him first both times, and I&#146;m not some stupid 
little baby,&#148; complained the child, her irritation at such treatment 
very obvious.
	For a moment, Setsuna considered Hotaru&#146;s complaint.  True, 
underneath the child was a great deal of power.  However, she was still 
a little girl, and finding her the way she just had did nothing to 
change Setsuna&#146;s perception of that.  Granted, Hotaru had more life 
knowledge than the average nine-year-old, but there were some things 
one just naturally tried to shield their child from, regardless of what 
life had already handed them.  
	Setsuna walked up to Hotaru and put out her hand for the glass 
the girl held.  As Hotaru reluctantly handed it over, Setsuna said, 
&#147;There&#146;s no need for you to be involved in this discussion at the 
moment.  We&#146;ll all talk about it later tonight, but for now, you need 
to let us handle it.  Even though I know that annoys you a great deal.&#148;
	Hotaru frowned as her mother finished speaking.  &#147;You want me to 
go do something somewhere else, don&#146;t you?&#148;
	&#147;Yes, please.&#148;
	&#147;Fine, fine,&#148; answered Hotaru.  She sighed dramatically for 
effect, and as she walked sulkingly past Setsuna, mumbled to herself, 
&#147;It&#146;s always wait until later, wait until you&#146;re older, wait, wait, 
wait, wait, wait...&#148;
	Setsuna smiled slightly and shook her head, then reached for the 
door.  When the door opened, the conversation immediately stopped.  
Setsuna walked in and set the glass on a table.  &#147;It&#146;s just me.  And I 
hear I missed some interesting developments while I was out.&#148;
	Haruka indicated the TV screens they had set up and paused on a 
familiar face.  &#147;It&#146;s definitely the same guy.  He&#146;s part of Senator 
Hino&#146;s entourage, which would have given him opportunity and easy 
access to any information he wanted on Rei.  Or anything else that 
would have caused a scandal for his employer, for that matter.&#148;
	&#147;What we&#146;re trying to do now is figure out his motive,&#148; picked up 
Michiru.  &#147;It would be nice to have a definite why.&#148;
	&#147;Money,&#148; guessed Setsuna.  &#147;It seems reasonable, and I&#146;m sure the 
story was worth a good deal to whoever paid for the information.&#148;
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;Rei and I spoke with the reporter who 
broke the news.  It&#146;s a long story,&#148; she said at the surprised looks 
she got.  &#147;But, anyway, he said he got all his information anonymously.  
No money ever exchanged hands, and I doubt he was lying about it.&#148;
	&#147;He&#146;s working for one of the Senator&#146;s opponents, then,&#148; 
suggested Michiru.  &#147;Disgrace and scandal can easily shift the people&#146;s 
vote.&#148;
	&#147;Makes sense,&#148; said Haruka.  &#147;But no one&#146;s tried to capitalize on 
it yet.  The other candidates have all been remarkably quiet on the 
subject, actually.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s because Senator Hino&#146;s public rating is so high,&#148; replied 
Setsuna.  &#147;People are curious about it, but most of them are still 
backing him.  For one of his opponents to speak out against him or his 
daughter when they&#146;re already being assaulted by the media could cause 
a backlash they wouldn&#146;t easily recover from.&#148;
	&#147;Well, whatever the reason, I&#146;m going to have to tell Rei,&#148; 
jumped in Makoto.  &#147;Her dad needs to know about this.  I hate to put 
more on her, though, with everything that&#146;s going on already.&#148;
	Haruka nodded.  &#147;And it would be nice if we had a little more to 
tell her.&#148;
	&#147;What are you thinking?&#148; asked Michiru, though she expected she 
already knew from the look on Haruka&#146;s face.
	&#147;I want to find this fellow and talk to him myself,&#148; answered 
Haruka.  &#147;So I can very kindly point out to him that I don&#146;t appreciate 
people sneaking around my family or using my friends for their own 
gain.&#148;
	&#147;&#146;Very kindly,&#146;&#148; repeated Setsuna skeptically.  &#147;That might not 
be the best approach in this situation.&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; said Michiru, appearing as if she were giving the 
idea a great deal of thought.  &#147;Having a few words with him and letting 
him know our position on this matter could be very helpful.  And if we 
can convince him to confess on his own, it would take the burden of 
having to tell her father off of Rei.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m coming with you,&#148; announced Makoto, the decision to go after 
the guy as good as made.
	Haruka immediately objected.  &#147;The three of us can handle this on 
our own.&#148;
	&#147;Rei is one of my best friends, and I owe her.  Plus, I&#146;ve known 
her longer than all of you,&#148; argued Makoto.  &#147;It&#146;s my responsibility to 
tell her about this, and to do that, I have to be there to know what 
happens.  Besides, I have an advantage you don&#146;t.&#148;
	Haruka looked at her dubiously, taking in the way she sat half 
lying in the chair, one hand resting across a belly that seemed to be 
getting in the way of everything anymore.  Any advantage Haruka could 
think of was nonexistent here.  Of course, in civilian form, Makoto was 
still more threatening than Ami or Usagi, but the threat quotient right 
now for all three of them wasn&#146;t much higher than that of a bowl of 
pudding.
	&#147;All right, Mako-chan,&#148; replied Haruka.  &#147;I&#146;ll bite.  Just what 
is this advantage?&#148;
	Makoto smiled as she answered, &#147;I already know where he is.&#148;


*            *            *

	It was early evening, and the Sunset Lounge of the 
Intercontinental was slowly filling with those patrons who preferred 
this room as a showcase for the setting sun.  Haruka and Michiru sat 
together at a small table by the wall of windows that overlooked Tokyo 
Bay.  The purple and orange of the real twilight sky flowed smoothly 
into the painted sky of orange clouds over their heads.  The recently 
lit Bay Bridge glowed a pale blue against the darkening day outside, 
and a slow tune was played on a baby grand only a few feet from them, 
offering the guests here a pleasant cover for their hushed 
conversations.
	Haruka took a sip from her glass, taking a moment to watch 
Michiru in this setting.  Her natural beauty outshone everything around 
them, as far as Haruka was concerned, as Michiru appeared to gaze out 
over the water.  Though Michiru&#146;s focus seemed to be on something 
beyond the glass, Haruka knew what she was really watching, because she 
was watching the same thing in the reflection in the glass over 
Michiru&#146;s shoulder.  Seated in a small cluster of chairs in the center 
of the room were the Senator and two other men, one of whom was their 
target.  The three men sat there, relaxing with their drinks and 
chatting casually, until the Senator&#146;s cell phone began to chirp.
	Hino answered the call, listened for several seconds, then 
replied back.  On his next pause, he covered the phone with his hand 
and said something quickly to the men with him.  At that point, the one 
they were after nodded, then got up and left, right before the Senator 
went back to his conversation.
	Standing slowly, Haruka put out a hand for Michiru to take.  
Michiru smiled at her and accepted gracefully.  They left the lounge 
together, discretely following their target.


	Makoto fidgeted and shifted more to her right side on the hard 
park bench that sat along one of the more scenic areas of the bay.  
They could see the hotel entrance clearly from here, and Setsuna hadn&#146;t 
taken her eyes off it since they&#146;d arrived.  Complaints aside, Makoto 
understood she was the most conspicuous of the group, and that she 
needed to stay out of immediate sight.  She only wished she and Setsuna 
had found a more comfortable place to wait it out while Haruka and 
Michiru were inside doing the scout work.
	As the streetlights began to flicker on, Makoto wondered if Ami 
had gotten home yet to get her message.  In a way, she was glad she 
hadn&#146;t had to explain this to Ami over the phone, because Makoto had a 
feeling Ami would have put up a bigger fight than Hotaru&#146;s small 
pouting fit when she was told they were going without her.  At least 
the promise of a few hours with Chibi-usa had seemed to make up for 
whatever the girl thought she would be missing with her parents 
tonight.
	Hearing Setsuna&#146;s communicator signal, Makoto stood and walked 
over to where the woman was leaning against a tree.  &#147;He&#146;s moving,&#148; 
said Haruka&#146;s image.  &#147;It looks like he&#146;s heading for the entrance.&#148;
	&#147;We&#146;re watching,&#148; answered Setsuna.  Then, a few minutes later, 
&#147;I see him.  He&#146;s moving across to the waterfront.&#148;
	Makoto saw Haruka and Michiru exit the hotel and leisurely move 
off on one side, as she and Setsuna did the same on the other side.  
Keeping a reasonable distance, they followed their target until he came 
upon a woman standing by the railing around the bay.
	&#147;I thought you were quitting,&#148; Makoto heard the man say to the 
woman as she took a drag off her cigarette.
	The woman turned to him slowly, looking less than pleased, and 
blew a puff of smoke in his face.  Then she dropped what was left of it 
on the ground and crushed it with the toe of her shoe.  &#147;Do you 
actually want something this time, Seki?  Or is it just bug the hell 
out of Kimiko night?&#148;
	Seki glared at her as she pushed a wave of long, dark blonde hair 
casually over her shoulder.  &#147;The Senator wants you back inside.  Ukio 
is on the phone with more problems over the expansion project.&#148;
	Not bothering to acknowledge Seki any further, Kimiko headed back 
to the hotel.
	Seki smirked as he leaned back against the concrete railing.  
&#147;Bitch,&#148; he muttered, reaching inside his jacket for his own pack of 
cigarettes.  He took one out of the pack and held his lighter to it, 
clicking it several times without getting a flame.
	&#147;Need a light?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, buddy, tha&#133;&#148;  Seki looked up, his words cutting off and 
his smile disappearing when he saw Haruka standing there, sans lighter.  
Then he noticed the other three loosely surrounding him and that there 
was no one else in sight.  &#147;You know, never mind about that light.  I 
need to get back.  My boss is waiting for me.&#148;
	Haruka smiled at him in a less than reassuring way.  &#147;I&#146;m sure 
your boss wouldn&#146;t mind giving you a few minutes to speak with us.  Or 
perhaps we could all go back inside and speak with him together.  You 
could go get your camera and take a picture, even, to remember us all 
by.&#148;
	Seki shifted nervously on his feet.  &#147;I really don&#146;t have time 
for this,&#148; he said as he tried to maneuver passed Haruka.
	Haruka moved so she was blocking his path.  She stood an inch 
lower than Seki, but her presence made her seem more dominating, and 
Seki swallowed hard as he was forced back against the rail.  &#147;You&#146;ll 
make the time,&#148; said Haruka.  &#147;Because there&#146;s a number of things we 
need to discuss, starting with how I don&#146;t like 30-year-old men 
secretly taking pictures of my 9-year-old daughter and ending somewhere 
around how unhappy I get when my friends are being used.&#148;
	They knew, that was obvious to Seki.  How much they knew was 
another matter, and he was going to have a little fun finding out.  
Seki calmed down and composed himself internally.  Then he said, &#147;I can 
understand how those things would upset you.  I&#146;m assuming this is all 
coming from you somehow having seen me keeping tabs on Senator Hino&#146;s 
daughter, and I can assure that, where your daughter is concerned, I 
have no interest in her.  I don&#146;t think she&#146;s in more than two or three 
photographs, and, if you want, I&#146;d be glad to give you those prints, as 
well as the negatives.&#148;
	That answer threw Haruka off a step.  She&#146;d been expecting more 
of a denial in there somewhere.  So it was Makoto who picked up for 
her.  &#147;That doesn&#146;t do anything for what you&#146;ve done to our friends.  
We know it was you who gave the story about Rei to the press.&#148;
	&#147;I suppose you have some proof of that?&#148; asked Seki calmly.
	&#147;Enough,&#148; answered Haruka.  &#147;And I&#146;m sure the Senator will be 
glad to hear all about it.&#148;
	Seki nodded, a smug look on his face.  &#147;I&#146;m sure he will.&#148;
	&#147;You don&#146;t seem terribly concerned at the prospect,&#148; said Michiru 
curiously.
	Seki shrugged at her.
	&#147;It&#146;s because he isn&#146;t,&#148; answered Setsuna.  &#147;Really look at him,&#148; 
she continued as the thoughts formed in her head.  &#147;He&#146;s a coward, and 
a self-serving one at that.  Men of that nature don&#146;t take chances with 
things that could potentially strip them of their positions and power.  
They operate only under those they work for, never on their own.&#148;
	&#147;Huh?&#148; asked Makoto.  &#147;What does that mean?&#148;
	&#147;It means,&#148; said Michiru, &#147;that the Senator already knows about 
this, because he was the one who ordered it.&#148;
	Seki tilted his head at her, snapping off a two-fingered salute.  
&#147;Beautiful and smart.&#148;
	Makoto was completely confused by this.  &#147;That doesn&#146;t make any 
sense.  He couldn&#146;t.  She&#146;s his daughter.&#148;
	&#147;She&#146;s a liability,&#148; returned Seki.  &#147;This is politics, young 
woman, and family does nothing but cause problems and cost you leverage 
when you need it most.&#148;
	&#147;Why bring her out in the open, then?&#148; asked Haruka.  &#147;I&#146;d think 
you would want this buried as far as you could get it.&#148;
	&#147;If that were possible,&#148; answered Seki.  &#147;But nothing gets buried 
forever.  It was bad enough when she met you two.  You know the old 
saying, &#145;Guilt by association.&#146;  But you&#146;re just a novelty, a sideshow 
to amuse people.  When they close the newspaper, they forget about you.  
Out of sight, out of mind, because your father isn&#146;t sitting in an 
office somewhere telling them how to live their lives or who they have 
to let into their neighborhoods, businesses, and schools.  But that&#146;s 
who Rei is, which is why her father has always had someone watching 
her.  I took over that job when I started working for him, and when I 
saw her with that girl the first time, I almost died.  Because I 
guarantee you, if I could catch them, so could anyone else.  So we made 
the decision to act on it first.  That way, we knew when the story 
would break, how it would happen, and we&#146;d have all our answers ready, 
including one to explain how I leaked the story if that little detail 
ever got out.  And the worst the kid has to deal with is 15 minutes of 
fame and the press following her around for a few weeks.  In the end, 
as long as we play it right, no harm done.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s insane!&#148; gasped Makoto.
	&#147;Maybe,&#148; returned Seki, his smugness growing and leaving no doubt 
this idea was his baby.  &#147;But it&#146;s all gone exactly as we had planned.&#148;
	Haruka&#146;s right hook landed squarely on the side of that 
insufferable grin.  Seki fell to the ground, cursing in pain as he held 
his bleeding mouth
	&#147;Haruka,&#148; scolded Michiru, though it was barely halfhearted.
	&#147;What?  Tell me you didn&#146;t want me to do that,&#148; she said as she 
pointed down at Seki.  Then Haruka turned her attention back to him.  
&#147;You listen to me.  If I ever see you anywhere near any member of my 
family again, you&#146;ll be in a whole lot more pain than you are right 
now.  The same goes for Rei and any of her family or friends.  You are 
done with her, your so called job be damned.&#148;
	Seki was in no position to argue, so he just stayed where he was, 
cowering on the ground, as the girls turned and left.


*            *            *

	Makoto sat quietly, her head resting against the back of the car 
seat and her eyes closed, as Haruka drove.  They&#146;d dropped the others 
off at the house, Setsuna tasked with picking Hotaru up from Chibi-
usa&#146;s, and were now on their way to Rei&#146;s.
	The car came to a halt, and when Haruka turned off the engine, 
Makoto opened her eyes.  She sat for a moment, staring at her hands, 
then took a deep breath and reached for the door handle.
	&#147;Are you sure you don&#146;t want me to go with you?&#148; asked Haruka as 
the car door was opened.
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;I need to do this, and I don&#146;t think Rei 
is going to want an audience.&#148;  Then she asked quietly, &#147;Do you know 
how to tell when something&#146;s really important to Rei?&#148;
	&#147;How?&#148;
	&#147;She pretends it&#146;s no big deal and not important at all,&#148; 
answered Makoto.  &#147;When she was staying with us, she mentioned in 
passing that her dad was coming to see her this weekend.  She said it 
like it was just an everyday little thing that happened all the time.  
I can&#146;t even imagine how much this is going to hurt her.&#148;  Makoto 
pulled herself up and out of the car, then turned back to Haruka.  &#147;I&#146;m 
not sure how long this will take.&#148;
	&#147;Don&#146;t worry about it,&#148; answered Haruka.  &#147;I&#146;m in no hurry.  I&#146;ll 
wait for you here.&#148;
	Makoto thanked her, then walked the short distance to the steps 
of the shrine.  &#147;More steps than the apartment,&#148; she muttered to 
herself as she slowly ascended, reminded of the other reason she hadn&#146;t 
been here in so long.
	Once she reached the top, Makoto paused to stretch and catch her 
breath, intentionally stalling for time in the process.  When she was 
ready, Makoto moved forward towards the main house.  She walked around 
the porch to Rei&#146;s room, pausing momentarily before knocking.
	Rei opened the door and smiled at her through her surprise.  
&#147;Hey, Mako-chan.  What&#146;s up?&#148; she asked as she moved aside to let the 
girl in.
	Makoto, however, stood where she was, rather than going inside.  
&#147;I need to talk to you for a few minutes.  Hi, Minako,&#148; she said when 
she saw the blonde sitting at the table with a textbook.
	&#147;Heya, Mako-chan,&#148; greeted Minako with a wave.  Then she smiled.  
&#147;Thanks for letting me borrow Ami tonight.  I left her off all safe and 
sound for you.&#148;
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; complained Rei.  &#147;And she came home with all these bags, 
but refuses to tell me what&#146;s in any of them.&#148;
	Minako answered by sticking her tongue out and blowing a 
raspberry.  Rei replied in kind, and Makoto grinned at them for a 
moment before a fresh stab of guilt hit her.  Her friends had found a 
way to be happy tonight, and, responsible for the situation or not, she 
was about to take that away from them.
	&#147;Rei, do you mind if we walk a little?&#148; asked Makoto, earning a 
curious look for it.  &#147;I&#146;m restless, and we can talk out here.&#148;
	Rei nodded.  &#147;Sure, if that&#146;s what you want,&#148; she answered, her 
mood shifting to better match Makoto&#146;s cautious and hesitant one.
	Before following Rei away from the room, Makoto paused and said 
to Minako, &#147;Come and find us in fifteen minutes, okay?&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; answered Minako quietly, staring intently after them 
through the open door as the two walked away together.
	They walked a bit, until they were down in the yard.  Rei chose 
the place where they stopped, turning and resting her back against one 
of the trees.  Her arms crossed over her chest, and she asked, &#147;So 
what&#146;s up, Mako-chan?  It must be pretty important for you to come all 
the way out here by yourself.&#148;
	&#147;Yeah, it is,&#148; replied Makoto.  &#147;But I&#146;m not here by myself.  
Haruka&#146;s waiting for me down in the car.  Actually, I&#146;ve been with her 
for most of the night.  There was something we had to do.&#148;
	She began to explain then, about what they had seen at Haruka&#146;s, 
the idea they had come up with to find the man themselves, and how they 
had gone about it.  As Makoto recounted what had been said, she watched 
Rei get progressively tenser.  She couldn&#146;t read Rei&#146;s expression as 
well as she would have liked, and wished Minako would get here quickly.  
But she did reach out to her friend as she finished speaking, laying a 
hand lightly against Rei&#146;s arm.
	At the contact, Rei stiffened even more.  &#147;He lied to you,&#148; she 
said, her voice deathly low.  &#147;It wasn&#146;t the truth.&#148;
	&#147;That&#146;s possible, I guess,&#148; offered Makoto.  &#147;But it&#146;s not really 
likely.  I&#146;m sorry, Rei, but it was your dad.&#148;
	&#147;No!&#148; shouted Rei angrily as she shrugged away from Makoto&#146;s 
touch.  &#147;He lied to you to save himself from getting into any more 
trouble.  He just didn&#146;t want you to go to my dad.  And you didn&#146;t, did 
you?  So you don&#146;t really know.&#148;
	&#147;No, we didn&#146;t,&#148; admitted Makoto.  &#147;It was different when we 
thought it was just this one man.&#148;
	&#147;It was just him,&#148; said Rei as she shakily ran a hand through her 
hair, pushing her bangs away from her eyes.  &#147;I know I have a lousy 
father, but he wouldn&#146;t do that to me,&#148; she went on, her voice 
beginning to lose some of its firmness.  &#147;He cares about me at least a 
little.  Why else would he call me to make sure I was okay?  And he 
wouldn&#146;t sell me out like that, not for all the trouble it would cause 
us.  No father could do that and just let everything fall apart, no 
matter how miserable they are.&#148;
	&#147;Rei?  What&#146;s going on?&#148; asked Minako softly as she slowly walked 
up behind Makoto.
	Rei looked over into those blue eyes filled with worry over her.  
When she saw that, everything she was feeling spilled over.  Angry 
tears filled her eyes as all the hurt and little betrayals she carried 
in her heart collided and became a physical thing.  The crushing weight 
in her chest made it hard to breathe and dulled the sting of her nails 
digging into her palms as her hands clenched tight.
	&#147;Damn him,&#148; she whispered harshly.  &#147;How could he?  Damn him!&#148; 
she spat out once more as she turned quickly and slammed a fist into 
the tree behind her.
	Makoto winced as Minako moved quickly around her to get to Rei.  
Makoto moved more cautiously, wanting to help, but uncertain how much 
Rei would want from her.  Minako, though, had already wrapped her arms 
around Rei from behind, trying to calm her and find out what was 
happening.
	Rei&#146;s palms rested against the rough bark of the tree, her body 
continuing to shake from the emotional release.  &#147;He lied to me again.  
And I believed him.  I always believe him.&#148;
	&#147;Her father,&#148; elaborated Makoto for Minako as she stepped up to 
them and laid a hand on Rei&#146;s shoulder.  &#147;He was behind the initial 
press on you guys.  He was trying to save face by getting to it first.&#148;
	&#147;Oh, Rei,&#148; murmured Minako, one hand moving to gently smooth back 
Rei&#146;s hair.
	&#147;I hate him,&#148; bit out Rei, her head bowed and her eyes squeezed 
closed.  &#147;I&#146;ll never forgive him for this.  He didn&#146;t care at all what 
would happen to me.  And everything this has done to you&#133;  I hate him 
so much.&#148;


*            *            *

	Ami was working at her desk when Makoto came home that night.  
She could tell right away that whatever errand Makoto had needed to 
take care of hadn&#146;t been a pleasant one.  Ami had started to rise, to 
go to her love and offer some comfort or perhaps talk it out.  But 
Makoto had put up a hand to stop her, only saying, &#147;Not right now,&#148; 
before going to their room and closing herself in.
	Makoto&#146;s request was respected for precisely 30 minutes.  When 
Ami still hadn&#146;t heard anything from her at that point, she got up and 
went to the bedroom.  After knocking softly, she opened the door to 
find Makoto sitting on the bed, an old photo album opened beside her.
	Ami went over and climbed onto the bed.  She looked down at the 
pictures and smiled at what she saw.  Makoto&#146;s parents, either alone or 
together, made up the content of the eight pictures.  The scenery 
behind them was all ocean and touristy exotic.
	&#147;Their honeymoon,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Dad used to say he was going to 
take them back there for their fiftieth anniversary.  He would tease 
mom about doing the geriatric hula.  Mom always hit him for it, but 
she&#146;d be laughing when she did.  I laughed, too, but it was because I 
thought geriatric had something to do with jell-o, and&#133;  Well, never 
mind what I was picturing.  It&#146;s a good memory.  My dad was a good 
husband and a good father,&#148; she said as she traced her fingers over the 
image in the photo.  &#147;I needed to remind myself what one looks like.&#148;
	Ami reached up and carefully brushed back a few stray strands of 
hair that had fallen from Makoto&#146;s ponytail.  That task complete, her 
fingers passed lightly over Makoto&#146;s cheek before she pulled her hand 
back and asked, &#147;Are you ready to talk about it yet?&#148;
	With a sigh, Makoto closed the photo album, then looked over at 
Ami.  &#147;It was Rei&#146;s father who outted her and Minako to the newspaper.  
He set the whole thing up.  And I had to tell her.&#148;
	Makoto went on to explain what had happened at Haruka&#146;s and all 
the things that were said at the Bay and the shrine.  She glossed over 
the scene at Rei&#146;s, not wanting to think about the hurt and betrayal 
she&#146;d left one of her dearest friends with.
	&#147;Poor Rei,&#148; said Ami quietly.  &#147;How could anyone do that to their 
child?&#148;
	&#147;I don&#146;t know,&#148; answered Makoto.  She closed her eyes for a 
moment, her hand coming to rest on her stomach.  She stroked the spot 
absently as she said, &#147;All I know is that it isn&#146;t fair.  We don&#146;t ask 
to be born and we don&#146;t get to choose our parents.  It&#146;s all just one 
big cosmic crap shoot.  Some of us are lucky enough to get dads who are 
there every spare minute they have, and others get ones who just don&#146;t 
give a damn.  And for some reason, it&#146;s always the rotten ones who get 
to go on, getting chance after chance, while the good ones get taken 
away.&#148;
	Ami laid her hand atop Makoto&#146;s and smiled gently.  &#147;I think it 
seems that way because the bad ones cause so much hurt when they&#146;re 
around, while the good ones just go on living their lives with their 
families.  And not all the good ones have disappeared.  My mom isn&#146;t 
perfect, but, even with her faults, I would never trade her for anyone 
else.&#148;
	&#147;Do you miss your dad?&#148;
	Ami&#146;s smile faded, and her eyes dropped.  &#147;That&#146;s a bit of a 
complicated question,&#148; she answered as her fingers began to play 
nervously with Makoto&#146;s.
	Makoto&#146;s fingers wrapped around Ami&#146;s to stop their fidgeting, 
and she ducked her own eyes down to try and catch Ami&#146;s gaze.  &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry,&#148; she said.  &#147;That was a stupid thing to ask.&#148;
	&#147;It&#146;s okay,&#148; replied Ami.  &#147;I just need a moment to think of how 
to phrase an answer.  Let&#146;s see&#133;  Most of what I remember about him is 
good, and  I miss the memory I have of him and the little things we 
used to do together.  But that isn&#146;t really him, just the ideal I have 
wrapped up in a child&#146;s vague memories.  Sometimes, it&#146;s hard to 
separate what I think I remember and what I know actually happened.  So 
I suppose I really miss the idea of the man more than I miss the man 
himself.  But at least I know for all the times I&#146;ve thought about him 
and wondered, he&#146;s also thought about me,&#148; she added, glancing up to 
the framed sketch that hung on the wall.  &#147;His squiggles just couldn&#146;t 
live with my straight lines.&#148;
	&#147;Your what?&#148;
	Ami continued to play with Makoto&#146;s fingers as she explained, 
&#147;When Papa left, Mom tried to find a way of explaining it to me so I 
would be able to understand easily.  She said Papa saw the world like 
one of his canvases.  On that canvas, she was a straight line, always 
going in one direction, always neat and ordered.  Papa was like 
squiggles, always moving and all over the place.  And squiggles and 
straight lines were just too different to live together and share a 
canvas.  Mom never said it, but I know Papa used to say I was just like 
her.  So he couldn&#146;t live with me, either,&#148; she concluded with a small, 
sad shrug.
	At that, Makoto made a derisive sound.  &#147;That&#146;s just ridiculous.  
You are not a straight line.  I don&#146;t know what you are, because I 
don&#146;t really know how to think of you like that, but I do know you 
aren&#146;t that boring.  I don&#146;t think your mom is either.&#148;  She gave a 
decisive nod, as if her word was final and unchallengeable.
	Ami&#146;s smile grew until a small giggle escaped.  &#147;I love you,&#148; she 
said happily.
	&#147;I love you, too,&#148; said Makoto as she reached out and pulled Ami 
closer so she could kiss her forehead.
	When Makoto&#146;s lips left her, Ami resettled against her side.  
When they were both comfortable, Ami asked, &#147;Would you like to know 
what you are on my canvas?&#148;
	Makoto looked at her, surprised.  &#147;You&#146;ve actually thought of me 
like that?&#148;
	&#147;Yes.  I&#146;ve thought of all of you in those terms.&#148;  Ami used her 
fingers to count off her friends as she began.  &#147;Usagi, for instance, 
is swirls and pinwheels, all in pastels, because she&#146;s soft and calming 
and chaotic and haphazard all at the same time.  Minako is brightly 
colored finger paints &#150; bubbly and bright and seemingly childish, 
though there&#146;s much more to be found under the surface if someone is 
willing to take the time to look and see the true artwork that she is.  
Rei is a bit different, because she&#146;s more like lights, the ones on a 
stereo or the media player on my computer &#150; always in tune with and 
moving to the pulse around them, flaring red at the highest peaks and 
calming to blues and greens when everything is at peace.&#148;
	&#147;Huh.  Okay, so what about me?&#148; asked Makoto, giving Ami a 
teasing poke in the ribs.
	&#147;You, Mako-chan, are like watercolors,&#148; said Ami through a joyful 
grin.  &#147;Gentle and beautiful, the edges not always clearly defined, but 
always my favorite type of painting.&#148;


*            *            *

	The elevator was going too slowly, and Rei was certain that if 
her father could have manipulated this as well, he would have.  He knew 
she was coming, that much was a given.  Walking into the hotel at an 
ungodly hour and very loudly demanding the Senator&#146;s room number hadn&#146;t 
gotten her very far.  Throwing her name around and threatening the 
livelihoods of anyone in her way had gotten a quick call up to the 
suite and an okay from their guest to allow his daughter up.  
	Rei tapped her foot impatiently as she watched the numbers rise 
on the floor indicator.  Finally, it stopped, the doors opening to her 
floor, and without hesitation, Rei made her way to the suite.  When her 
father opened the door to her wordlessly, she pushed past him and moved 
to the center of the room.  She stood with her arms crossed over her 
chest and stared at him until he closed the door and turned to face 
her.
	For just a moment, when he saw Rei standing there with the deep 
orange of the rising sun in the windows behind her, the Senator was 
struck with a profound sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  But it had been a setting sun 
that day, and the woman who had stood before him had spoken in a tone 
of quiet finality.  Yet, even in silence, no part of his daughter was 
quiet.
	&#147;I don&#146;t need to ask why you did this,&#148; said Rei, her voice hard 
as she glared at her father.  &#147;I don&#146;t even need to ask if it&#146;s true, 
because I can see it in your eyes.  But how could you?  After all the 
times I defended you, and all the things I overlooked, how could you do 
this to me?&#148;
	The Senator took a hesitant step towards her and said calmly, 
&#147;You would have been better off if your friends hadn&#146;t told you about 
any of this, but I suppose that&#146;s a moot point.  I understand you&#146;re 
upset, Rei, and though our relationship was the primary factor in all 
of this, it was never meant to harm you personally or reflect my 
feelings towards you.  It was simply a matter of business.  You and 
your friend have suffered some embarrassment, I&#146;m aware, but it will 
all blow over soon.  In the meantime,&#148; he went on, moving closer to her 
and tentatively placing a hand on her shoulder, &#147;I&#146;ll make it up to 
you.  Whatever you want.&#148;
	&#147;You have no idea, do you?&#148; asked Rei harshly.  She shoved his 
hand off of her and moved several steps away.  &#147;You bastard.  You don&#146;t 
even know what you&#146;ve done to us.  Embarrassment we could have lived 
with, but Minako&#146;s parents didn&#146;t know, and you have no clue what 
they&#146;re like.  They hate the idea of us being together, and if we can&#146;t 
convince a total stranger in a court room that we&#146;re capable enough to 
live our own lives, her parents are going to send her as far away from 
me as they can get her.  She ran away from them for me.  She spent 
nights hiding from everyone, all for me.  She can&#146;t go home again, she 
can&#146;t even show her face in public, let alone go back to school.  And I 
don&#146;t even have a school to go back to.  Because of all this, they&#146;ve 
expelled me.  So not only do I stand a very good chance of losing the 
one person in this world who means everything to me, I also have to 
face Grandpa with the shame of Mom&#146;s school hanging over me.  I can 
live with that, though, but not with losing Minako.  And if I do, you 
better hope like hell that your people are willing to die for you.&#148;
	Pure hatred flashed in Rei&#146;s eyes, and her father saw it clearly.  
He swallowed down the sudden fear he felt rising, mentally chastising 
himself for being afraid of this girl.  Then, pulling up as much 
bravado as he could, the Senator stared down his daughter.  &#147;I&#146;m sorry 
for what&#146;s happened to you, but I am still your father.  I will not 
tolerate you making any kind of threats at me.&#148;
	A bitter laugh escaped Rei&#146;s lips.  &#147;You aren&#146;t my father.  My 
father wouldn&#146;t have done something like this.&#148;  Then she paused, a sad 
frown replacing the scowl she wore.  Softly, she added, &#147;My father 
didn&#146;t.&#148;
	A heavy silence hung between them for several moments, broken 
finally by Rei&#146;s voice.  &#147;Don&#146;t ever come near me again,&#148; she said 
firmly.  &#147;Don&#146;t try to call me, or follow me, or send me any more gifts 
with cards signed by your assistant.  I loved you, and for the life of 
me, I can&#146;t understand why.  Mom loved you, too, even in the end, and 
I&#146;ll never understand that either.  What I do know is the wrong person 
died in this story, and from now on, I&#146;m going to live it as close to 
the way it should have gone as I can.&#148;  Pushing roughly passed her 
father, Rei walked towards the door and opened it without looking back.
	The door slammed hard behind Rei as she left her father standing 
alone in the middle of the room.  A minute later, Kimiko appeared in 
the bedroom doorway.  She leaned against the doorframe, hands in the 
pockets of her slacks, and smirked.  &#147;Well, that could have gone 
better.&#148;
	The Senator shot her a harsh look in return.  &#147;Shut up, Kimiko,&#148; 
he said as he walked over to the room&#146;s mini bar.  &#147;I&#146;ve had just about 
all I can stand of you and your &#145;I told you so&#146;s.&#146;&#148;
	As the Senator dropped two ice cubes into a glass and poured 
amber liquid over them, Kimiko stood straighter, her smirk 
disappearing.  &#147;Do not talk to me like I&#146;m Seki or some other lackey of 
yours.  I&#146;ve got more than a decade of my life wrapped up in your 
career and just as much riding on you getting reelected as you do.  And 
just to reiterate, I did tell you something like this would happen, but 
you wouldn&#146;t listen because apparently I&#146;m too &#145;out of touch&#146; with 
today&#146;s voters.  It was your little lapdog, Seki, who thought this was 
brilliant and foolproof, so if you need to take it out on someone, take 
it out on him.  After all, he&#146;s the one who got caught by a bunch of 
kids.&#148;  She sighed, her gaze shifting to the closed door.  &#147;You aren&#146;t 
going to be able to get her back this time.&#148;
	The Senator grimaced as he swallowed the last of the glass&#146; 
contents.  &#147;I gave up Rei a long time ago, when I lost her mother.  
It&#146;s not my problem that it&#146;s taken her this long to realize it.&#148;  He 
set the glass down hard, the ice clinking against the sides as he did.  
&#147;And you do well to remember that you do work for me, just like Seki, 
no matter how much longer you may have been employed.  Speaking of him, 
do we have all of that worked out?  Just in case Rei or one of her 
friends decides to take this to the papers.&#148;
	Some of the edge Kimiko had been carrying abated as she switched 
to professional mode.  &#147;There are a few points that I want you to go 
back over, just to make sure everything syncs up.  Seki&#146;s already in 
transit, so that&#146;s one major thing out of our way.  If it comes down to 
it, we&#146;ll hang him like we&#146;d planned and keep him out of sight so no 
one can question him.  And the idiot gets an extended vacation, on us.&#148;
	A harsh bark of laughter escaped the Senator.  &#147;Almost makes you 
wonder just who the real idiot is,&#148; he said wryly.  Then, &#147;As soon as 
it&#146;s an appropriate hour, call the Ainos and tell them there&#146;s been a 
change in my schedule.  I want to meet with them tomorrow night instead 
of Friday.  Be as polite as possible, because I want to find out what&#146;s 
going on there without having to ask.&#148;
	&#147;Right,&#148; answered Kimiko.  &#147;Is that it?&#148;
	&#147;For now,&#148; answered the Senator.
	Kimiko nodded, then set about her routine, getting things 
organized and ready, leaving the Senator alone to his thoughts.  The 
Senator, for his part, poured himself another drink, heedless of the 
early hour and the protesting his stomach would likely do later.  
Instead, he collapsed wearily onto the couch, idly wondering to himself 
just how loyal his people really were.


*            *            *

	In a close to panicked state, Minako finished describing Rei to 
the desk clerk.  She knew this was where Rei was most likely to come if 
she hadn&#146;t gotten here already.  Mentally, Minako berated herself once 
again for falling asleep and not even noticing when Rei left in what 
was practically the middle of the night.
	The desk clerk nodded.  &#147;Yes, she was here.  You don&#146;t forget 
someone like that easily.  She left a short while ago after visiting 
with one of our guests.&#148;
	&#147;Thank you,&#148; answered Minako.  She moved away from the desk and 
over to where Grandpa was waiting for her.  &#147;He said she was here, but 
we missed her,&#148; she said, her voice worried.
	Grandpa reached for her hand and patted it gently.  &#147;Try not to 
worry so much.  We&#146;ll find her,&#148; he said, though his own concern was 
plain to see.
	They were near the entrance, on their way out, when Yuichiro came 
rushing inside.  &#147;I spotted her.  She&#146;s across the street by the bay,&#148; 
he said quickly.
	That was all Minako needed.  She broke away from them and hurried 
out of the hotel.
	Grandpa sighed quietly, feeling some relief.  &#147;We should wait for 
them at the car,&#148; he said, to which Yuichiro nodded.
	Once she was across the street, Minako found Rei easily.  The 
miko stood with her arms crossed on the railing, staring out over the 
water.  Her hair blew gently away from her face as the breeze off the 
bay picked up a bit.  As she got closer, Minako noticed the shine on 
Rei&#146;s cheeks, a combination of mist and recent tears mixed together 
with tension and emotional exhaustion.
	Minako approached slowly and carefully laid a hand against Rei&#146;s 
back.  She stood beside Rei and waited for some response.  When she got 
none, she said quietly, &#147;I&#146;m sorry I fell asleep on you like that.  You 
know, it surprised me when I woke up and you weren&#146;t there.  And I 
think I may have scared Grandpa a bit when I told him I couldn&#146;t find 
you.  But we thought this was where you would be, so he and Yuichiro 
brought me to get you.&#148;  She hesitated, biting her lip nervously as Rei 
did nothing more than stare out across the water.  &#147;I guess you saw him 
already,&#148; she went on cautiously.  &#147;If you want to talk about it, or 
maybe there&#146;s something you might want to tell me&#133;&#148;
	Minako was cut short as Rei reached for her and pulled her in 
close, Minako&#146;s back to Rei&#146;s front.  Minako stood facing out where Rei 
had been staring with Rei&#146;s arms tight around her and pinning her own 
to her sides.  Then Rei&#146;s cheek brushed against her ear, and Minako 
felt the warmth and moisture there for just a second before Rei&#146;s chin 
rested on her shoulder.
	Managing to free one of her arms, Minako raised it so she could 
touch some part of Rei.  &#147;It&#146;ll be all right, Rei,&#148; she said softly as 
her fingers brushed through dark hair.  &#147;We&#146;ll make everything okay 
eventually.  But for now, we should go home.&#148;
	Rei&#146;s grip tightened for a moment in answer, and Minako nodded.
	&#147;If that&#146;s what you want,&#148; replied the blonde.  &#147;We have a few 
hours before we have to be anywhere.&#148;
	&#147;I didn&#146;t forget about the lawyer,&#148; said Rei, her voice barely 
above a whisper.  &#147;I would have been there for you.  I always will be.&#148;
	&#147;I know,&#148; answered Minako, her free arm coming to rest over top 
of Rei&#146;s.  &#147;I never doubted that.  I was just worried about you.&#148;
	&#147;Where&#146;s Grandpa?&#148; asked Rei.
	&#147;I left him by the hotel,&#148; replied Minako, automatically trying 
to look over her shoulder.  &#147;They might be waiting for us there.  Or 
maybe they went back to the car.&#148;
	Rei nodded against Minako&#146;s shoulder, then loosened her grip and 
moved Minako so they were standing eye to eye.  Rei brought her hand up 
and placed it lightly against Minako&#146;s cheek, then slowly let her thumb 
trace over Minako&#146;s lips.  Carefully, she leaned forward and pressed 
her lips against Minako&#146;s forehead.  After several seconds, Rei pulled 
back and took Minako&#146;s hand in hers.
	Her voice sounded tired as Rei said, &#147;I&#146;m ready to go home, now.&#148;  
Then she started forward, still holding on to Minako&#146;s hand, leaving 
the bay behind them.
