<h1>Loving</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saun.html">Saun</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The blonde pushed the front door open and let Michiru go through it
first before slipping her keys back in her pocket. The violinist dropped
her wrap on the white couch and headed for the kitchen. The blonde was
left to secure the door.

Haruka paused, without Hotaru or Setsuna at home it was extremely
quiet. Too quiet for the blonde&#39;s taste. She headed for the stereo
system and sifted through their extensive CD collection. Bypassing the
Card Captor Sakura and Pokemon soundtracks the racer settled on
something more sophisticated. She hit play and adjusted the volume as
the surround sound poured the soft strains throughout the house.

Pleased, Haruka gathered Michiru&#39;s wrap and pulled her own silk scarf
from around her neck and replaced them on their respective hangers in
their room. While she was there Haruka pulled off her jacket and hung
it up as well.

When the blonde returned to the living room, it was dark other than
the warm glow from the two small lamps that Michiru had turned on. The
beautiful artist was seated on the couch. A wine bottle and two
glasses sat in front of her on the coffee table.

&quot;What&#39;s the occasion?&quot; Haruka wondered aloud as she tugged at her tie.

&quot;Do we need one?&quot; Michiru offered her lover the corkscrew.

Haruka&#39;s mouth quirked.

&quot;You&#39;re wanting to get a little wild tonight, eh?&quot;  Her teal eyes were
warm and teasing. Her lover met her intense look and smiled
suggestively. The cork made a soft hissing as the bottle opened.

Michiru unpinned her hair and shook out the curls in a wonderfully
feminine motion that Haruka found very sexy. Her gaze lingered on the
slender curve of the violinist&#39;s nape.

Haruka poured Michiru a glass and then filled her own. They expertly
swirled it before sipping.

The blonde pulled her tie off and casually tossed it on the table next
to the bottle.

Soon the racer was feeling mellow from the wine and the music and rose
to her feet.  She offered a hand to Michiru who took it and allowed herself
to be pulled off the couch and into Haruka&#39;s arms. They slow danced to
the soft ballroom music. Haruka found herself lost in the gentle rhythm and
without them noticing almost half an hour slipped away.

They swayed together; the way they fit was so natural. Haruka led them
with fluid grace. Michiru pressed closer and they rocked.

Hungry for closer contact, Haruka&#39;s body urged Michiru to follow her
lead. She expertly guided them to their room, but the aqua haired
woman was so lost in the scent and feel of Haruka that she didn&#39;t
realize where they were until the back of her knees hit the bed.
Haruka released her but only for a moment. She stroked her fingers up
the back of Michiru&#39;s arm and was delighted when her mate shivered at
the stimulation. The handsome racer hugged Michiru close for a moment
before pulling back and tenderly regarding her partner.

The blonde gently lowered her lover into the pool of moonlight in the
center of their comforter. Then Haruka lay down beside her and caught
her lover&#39;s lips in a sweet, hot kiss. The kisses continued as they slowly
explored the other&#39;s mouth in a tender exchange. Haruka&#39;s strong hand
moved to cup Michiru&#39; satiny cheek. They broke apart with a soft gasp on
Michiru&#39;s part. Neither woman was in a hurry so they slowly re-engaged.
The violinist&#39;s hands went to cradle Haruka&#39;s head. Her tongue darted
out to taste the salt of the blonde&#39;s lips. Their tongues met.

Haruka groaned and levered herself on top on Michiru. The kisses went
on exciting and inflaming them. Michiru&#39;s leg wrapped around Haruka&#39;s
waist and she moved it restlessly against the blonde&#39;s side. In
seconds Haruka&#39;s hand was there cupping Michiru&#39;s knee teasing the
soft skin behind it before stroking up her inner thigh.

&quot;Ooh.&quot; Michiru shivered with anticipation and angled her leg out.
Haruka&#39;s gaze was intense and her swollen lips slightly parted
allowing her to take panting breaths. The blonde&#39;s entire focus was
on her lover and she watched Michiru&#39;s face intently for signs of
pleasure. Every slight catch in her breath was noted. The violinist
made a sexy little noise in the back of her throat as her partner&#39;s
hand found the edge of her secret soft skin and stroked it with a
knuckle. Haruka couldn&#39;t stand it and with a low growl of desire she
took Michiru&#39;s lips again.

Michiru sucked at the tender skin on Haruka&#39;s neck while the blonde
shrugged out of her white dress shirt. Kisses traced across the racer&#39;s
collarbones and she moaned.A strong hand cupped Michiru&#39;s right breast and
squeezed it slightly, thumbing the nipple through the fabric of Michiru&#39;s 
bra.

Michiru broke contact with her and cried out. They rolled then and Michiru
jerked her black bra off over her head and threw it on the floor.
Haruka chuckled but the sound was muffled when Michiru&#39;s mouth made
contact with hers. The violinist&#39;s hands were playing with Haruka&#39;s
small breasts stroking the soft globes and causing her mate to gasp as
sensation surged from the blonde&#39;s aching nipples.

They kissed again fervently, their tongues softly stroking; Michiru&#39;s
hands undid Haruka&#39;s belt and pushed her trousers down over her hips.
Haruka had to sit up to kick off her pants and underwear, but the
moment they hit the floor she found herself on her back again, with a
gloriously nude Michiru perched delicately on her toned stomach. Their
palms met on either side and their slender fingers entwined.

Haruka smiled up into the tender eyes of her lover. For all that they
desired each other physically, it was love that was the strong center
of their relationship.

&quot;Aishiteru, Haruka.&quot; Michiru said softly. She could feel the blonde&#39;s
right thumb gently tracing a pattern on the back of her hand.

&quot;Michiru.&quot; Haruka said huskily back, the sound sending a shiver down
the violinist&#39;s spine and she leaned forward touching her forehead to
Haruka&#39;s. Their eyes closed but a soft smile played on the racer&#39;s
lips

&quot;You love me.&quot; Haruka repeated, the words making pleasurable
sensations bloom in her chest.

&quot;Hai,&quot; was the faint reply. Haruka&#39;s hands were now stroking Michiru&#39;s
legs. She felt the artist&#39;s hands cupping her cheek as their noses
touched.

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful, Michiru,&quot; Haruka whispered tenderly just before
she again kissed her lover. A finger slid between Michiru&#39;s legs and
teased her plump lips. The blonde sat up and with her hand on a satiny
hip settled her lover in her lap. Michiru&#39;s breath came in short
pants. Two fingers slid into her wet heat, causing a strangled gasp.
The violinist rocked her hips against the busy hand, impaling herself
deeper, while enjoying the firm circling of Haruka&#39;s thumb on the
small bud at the front of her sex. Sweat broke out on Haruka&#39;s brow
and she buried her face in the crook of Michiru&#39;s neck, seeking a
particular sensitive spot and sucking at it much to her lover&#39;s
delight.

Michiru was a very active participant in this loving. She rode
Haruka&#39;s thrusting fingers, her arms wrapped around the racer&#39;s
slender neck. Haruka&#39;s mouth had found her breasts and was suckling at
a velvet nipple, causing soft gasps to echo through the room. When the
end came Michiru arched and shuddered, brokenly crying out Haruka&#39;s
name. With a final quiver she fell forward, her bangs brushing
Haruka&#39;s sculpted shoulder.

The blonde pulled her closer and ran her hands comfortingly up and
down the artist&#39;s back causing tiny shivers to ripple through Michiru&#39;s
body. They clung to each other. Michiru raised her face only to have
it dotted with tender kisses while a wet hand smoothed her hair back
from her face. The violinist responded and sought Haruka&#39;s chiseled
lips with her own. The blonde wrapped her arm around Michiru and
cradled the violinist&#39;s head.

She broke the kiss and in a smooth motion Haruka rolled forward
pinning her lover beneath her and gently rubbed their bodies
together - groaning deeply as her breasts pressed against Michiru&#39;s
soft skin. A wave of passion overcame her and she kissed down
Michiru&#39;s chest and soft belly. The violinist reached out to run a
finger lightly over the blonde&#39;s earlobe and Haruka shivered, sliding
her hands down to frame her lover&#39;s hips. In seconds she was using
her very talented tongue to bring Michiru again to orgasm.

The aqua haired woman gave a cry of surprise and her hands went
automatically to back of the blonde&#39;s head. Haruka&#39;s tongue stroked
and circled the tiny sensitive bud before darting lower. The
violinist&#39;s legs trembled as the tension once again built between her
taut thighs.  Haruka loved her fervently, tongue and teeth working in
harmony to increase the delirious tension that was building in the
violinist&#39;s body.  Michiru stiffened as pleasurable surges crashed over
her. Her cries were passionate and musical to the racer&#39;s ear.

Haruka was thorough and when Michiru opened her eyes after the last
slow pulse faded they were dark pools of satisfaction tinged with a
little awe. Haruka smiled at her and leaned close.

&quot;I love you, Michiru,&quot; the racer whispered the words into her lover&#39;s
ear, her soft breath tickling the fine hairs. Her partner shivered with
joy and pulled Haruka down where she could reach the blonde.

Michiru&#39;s dry lips brushed at Haruka&#39;s temple then down to her strong
throat. Haruka arched her neck, her eyes closing as the velvety caress
of lips made her want to block out all other sensations. Love welled
up inside the violinist and she made her touches gentle as she stroked
her beloved&#39;s sweaty body.

Her hands slid down Haruka&#39;s sides, stopping to cradle her hips while
Michiru pressed feather light kisses against the unyielding abdominal
muscles. Haruka bent her legs and drew them up, inviting exploration,
but Michiru lingered above the blonde&#39;s groin, lost in the texture and
intoxicating scent of her lover&#39;s skin.

Above her she heard a gasp as she slid one hand under a toned thigh
and up for a quick caress against already slippery flesh.
Haruka arched, crying out. Michiru saw the tight peaks and abandoned
her descent to caress and taste her lover&#39;s breasts.

Haruka gasped somewhere between frustration and ecstasy as Michiru
delicately fondled her nipples causing her loins to ache. She thrust her
hips lightly and Michiru responded by sliding two fingers inside her
passage and moving them in and out. The blonde groaned and
her eyes slid closed as a warm rush of sensation fogged her senses.

&quot;Michiru!&quot; she whispered in a low voice made husky by need. She
opened her eyes to meet the warm gaze of her lover. There was no
doubt in Haruka&#39;s mind that Michiru cherished her and she could read
that tender love in her mate&#39;s gentle blue eyes.  She moaned and this
time when she drew up her legs, her beloved nestled between them.

She couldn&#39;t resist stroking Haruka&#39;s well-muscled legs. They were
sleek and beautiful and Michiru kissed the inside of one ankle then her
lover&#39;s knee, then her inner thigh.

Haruka&#39;s eyes rolled back as her lover&#39;s tongue at long last began to
probe her wet folds.

The artist&#39;s hands continued to massage Haruka&#39;s inner thighs and push
them apart.

Haruka&#39;s cries were low and strained as she felt heat radiate from her
groin. Michiru&#39;s fingers were inside her once again and made soft
squishing noises as again and again they parted the slick flesh.

Haruka&#39;s chest heaved as she drew in ecstatic breaths.
Michiru began to suck steadily on the small bundle of nerves at the
top of Haruka&#39;s sex.

Above her the blonde cried out hoarsely as icy flames of pleasure
licked over her body. She bucked as her body spasmed around Michiru&#39;s
fingers. With a last lick the violist pulled out of Haruka&#39;s quivering
flesh and rolled beside the recovering blonde. Haruka&#39;s arm went
around her and they rolled to face each other. Michiru couldn&#39;t help
but stroke the blonde&#39;s warm cheek.

They lay drowsily in the darkness happy to be together, their souls
feeling complete. Several minutes passed as they wrestled with
wakefulness, neither wanting to lose the intimacy of the moment.

&quot;Sit up.&quot; Michiru whispered and Haruka obeyed, eyes questioning.
Michiru slid behind the blonde and pulled the taller woman back
against her. Haruka&#39;s eyes closed in pleasure as she felt herself
folded protectively in her beloved&#39;s embrace. The blonde&#39;s own hands
lay on top of Michiru&#39;s, holding the aqua-tressed woman in place.

Michiru couldn&#39;t resist dotting fervent little kisses in the damp
feathery hair behind her love&#39;s ear. They stayed that way for a long
time before Haruka rolled to her knees and turned to her sleepy
girlfriend. She gallantly helped Michiru find a comfortable position
on her side before spooning herself around the violinist. They
snuggled close, weary but content. Haruka pressed a final tender kiss
against Michiru&#39;s temple and nuzzled her nape while the violinist
lightly stroked her lover&#39;s embracing arm. It didn&#39;t take long for
them to fall asleep and dream of a day when the world would be at
peace.

Notes:
One day I was in the mood just to read how H&amp;M expressed their
tenderness and affection for each other during their lovemaking.
