<p><em>The  Game of Chance</em></p>
<p>“EVEN!”</p>
<p>The dice landed... on a two and a five. Rei looked up and grinned  at her exuberant student. “Sorry, Mina-chan, that's another  two tokens for me. Care to raise the stakes?”</p>
<p>At that, Mina met Rei's gaze, and raised a suggestive eyebrow. Rei  sighed and shook her head. “I was referring to money,  Mina-chan. We'll never get down to the bottom if you keep only  betting two. And here I was about to go on thinking you liked to  gamble.”</p>
<p>“I do!” Mina sighed and leaned back. “I think  I've lost my edge though.”</p>
<p>“All right, ready for the lesson then?”</p>
<p>Again, Mina glanced up, surprised. “I thought we were taking  a break from lessons.”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head for a negative. “No, gambling's a key  trait for pirates, too. All right, lean over here and look at these  dice.”</p>
<p>Mina did as she was told, leaning in so that their noses were only a  few inches apart. As Mina watched Rei's fingers nimbly roll the dice  so that she could see each face, her eyes widened in realization.  Her yell knocked Rei back from her leaning position, along with a  noticeable wince. “Hey! No fair! You were <em>cheating</em>!”</p>
<p>Rubbing her sore ear woefully, Rei nodded. “Next time you  decide to yell, back up first.” Once the ringing had  stopped, Rei inquired, knowing full well what the answer was, “Would  you like to know how, if you were the one picking odd or even?”</p>
<p>Mina nodded, looking cutely apologetic. “Pretty please?”</p>
<p>“As a side note... apologizing, especially like that, make you  all the less like a pirate.” Though Mina opened her mouth to  protest, Rei raised a single finger and shook her head. “It  doesn't matter. Here, hold these.”</p>
<p>Rei handed her the dice, as well as the cup that they were using to  roll around the dice and hide them before revealing the outcome.  Once Mina had taken them, Rei instructed, “All right, now put  the dice in and roll. I'll call it when you put it down.”</p>
<p>“Even.” The dice came up odd. To further demonstrate,  Rei asked Mina to call the next one.</p>
<p>“Odd.” The dice came up odd.</p>
<p>Rei repeated it, choosing odd. The dice came up even. “Do  you understand how it works yet? It's no longer individual luck.  The dice will always agree with the dealer. These, I blessed myself,  but Haruka showed me some others that she has that the other pirates  use. You could tell that I somehow fixed the results, because you  probably sense my energy from them. The other senshi probably  wouldn't be able to, unless they were paying close attention.”</p>
<p>“Why did I feel it so easily then?”</p>
<p>At that, Rei grinned, and leaned over to lightly brush her lips over  Mina's. “Because you love me.” Rei paused, and then  made a smooth transition back to her original position, flicking her  hair back over her shoulder. “And also, because if you  couldn't sense it now, then this lesson would be hopeless. You can  have those dice, by the way. Just so long as you don't get me  anything if the dice help you win it. Go ahead, try to defy the dice  while I go find the... necessary components for a second level of  gambling lessons.”</p>
<p>“What are you looking for?”</p>
<p>“Don't worry about it- I'll be back soon.”</p>
<p>Mina watched as Rei walked to the cabin door, opening it, and  closing it behind her. She then stared at the dice in her hands. In  her eyes, they were glowing with a warm, soothing radiance. <em>In my  hands, these dice give me the same feeling that her kisses do. On a  much smaller degree, but still... it's undeniable.</em></p>
<p>“Even.” Mina started practicing with the dice, rolling  it with her hands so she could see what really happened. It landed  on a total of six.</p>
<p>The next time, Mina waited until the dice had stopped rolling- at a  pair of twos, to call out, “Odd.” She watched as one of  the dice glowed a familiar red, before it turned so that a three was  face up. When she blinked, the glow was gone.</p>
<p>“Cool... Thanks Rei-chan... I'm going to treasure this...”</p>
<p>“Good- I'd hate to see a present gone to waste in the trash.”   Mina looked up to see Rei reenter with Haruka and Makoto. Between  the latter two was a rather suspicious looking crate...</p>
<p>“What's in the box?”</p>
<p>Rei dismissed her question idly as she took her seat again across  from Mina. After setting the box down between Haruka's and Rei's  seats, the two official pirates joined them at the table. “It's  nothing much. Mako-chan won't let us drink alcohol until we <em>actually</em> turn twenty-one... so this is compensation. But before that... You  know how to play BS, don't you? (pretend she's saying the full word,  if it suits you. I won't say it though)”</p>
<p>When Rei held up a deck of cards, Mina nodded enthusiastically.  “Ooh fun! But wait... how do we gamble for this?”</p>
<p>“It's fairly simple. Everyone starts out with ten gold coins,  twenty silver, and thirty bronze coins. Each card is worth one  bronze coin. As you know, five bronze equals one silver, and five  silver equals one gold. If you get someone to pick up five cards,  they forfeit five bronze pieces to you. If you lose all of your  coins before you lose all of your cards, you get booted from that  game, and the rest of your cards go into the middle. When only one  person has all the gold, or when one loses all their cards, they win.   Got it?”</p>
<p>Mina nodded again, followed by Makoto. Haruka asked, leaning  forward in her backwards chair, “Why so little cash though? We  have more than this. A lot more.”</p>
<p>“When  you learn to swim, do you start in shallow water with experienced  swimmers, or take a boat into the middle of the ocean and jump?”</p>
<p>“Uhh... fine, I see your point.  Didn't you say we were going to concentrate on weapon practice  though?”</p>
<p>As Rei began shuffling and dealing out  the cards, she answered, “This <em>is </em>weapon training- just without  blades. Mind over matter, as they say.”</p>
<p>Through a round of coin flipping, Rei  was chosen to go first. “Two Aces.”</p>
<p>Haruka went next, casually placing two  cards of her own on Rei's. “Two Twos. I'm not bad at cards  but... why the change of plan?”</p>
<p>As Mina placed her one card on the  table, Rei effortlessly responded, “BS Mina-chan. Haven't you  heard? A woman's allowed to change her mind.”</p>
<p>Haruka laughed while Mina took up the  five cards, pushing five bronze across the table to where Rei could  reach it and pull it into her own stash. Makoto put a card down  before adding her own comment. “One Four. But you know,  Rei-sensei, most teachers don't sit down and gamble with their  students.”</p>
<p>“One Five. Most teachers aren't  teaching their students to be efficient pirates.”</p>
<p>“One Six.” Haruka place  her card on the table. “You mean we weren't efficient before?”</p>
<p>Rei airily commented, keeping her eyes  trained on her cards, “BS Ruka. And why don't you tell <em>me</em>?”</p>
<p>Haruka sighed as  she swept up the cards, moving three bronze to Rei. Mina placed her  two cards on the table, bluff uncalled. Makoto answered Rei's question  after placing two cards on the pile. “Two Eights. I'll admit,  Rei-sensei, we don't normally do even half the things you had us do  yesterday, but I can see the reasoning for doing it all.”</p>
<p>“Two Nines. Of course you wouldn't do it before; you aren't expected to  as captains, but you might as pirates.”</p>
<p>“BS Rei.” Makoto called.</p>
<p>Rei grinned, and flipped over her last  two cards. A pair of Nines. Grumbling, Makoto took the stack, and  forked over a silver and a bronze.</p>
<p>Haruka placed a card on the table.  “One Ten. Yeah, who would have thought? Me, the greatest  pirate that ever lived- washing the deck like a common servant.”</p>
<p>“BS.” Mina and Rei were in  sync, and as they looked up at each other, both grinned. Haruka  sighed again as she took back her card.</p>
<p>Then she looked between them and  asked, “Who should I give my bronze to?”</p>
<p>Both grinned wider before answering,  “She can have it.”</p>
<p>Makoto reached over and swiped the  coin from Haruka's grasp. “Gee thanks!” The two younger  girls glanced at each other, but shrugged in acceptance.</p>
<p>Mina put two cards down. “Two  Jacks. Hey, it's not like I have experience doing any of that menial  cleaning either.”</p>
<p>Rei briefly considered calling Mina's  bluff, but decided not to, for the sake of letting the pile grow.  Makoto put down a single card, but Rei again resigned against the  chance to call.</p>
<p>“One King. And Mina-chan? I  happen to remember a certain incident back at the Kingdom that had  you helping the servants for more than enough time to learn the  trade. Though, according to the remains of five dishes now residing  in the trash bin..</p>
<p>“One Ace. Really, Mina-chan?  What'd you do?”</p>
<p>A light blush stained Mina's guilty  facade as she put down two cards. “Three Twos. I don't want  to repeat it, if you don't mind.”</p>
<p>“One Three. Aw come on,  Mina-chan. It can't be all that bad, can it?”</p>
<p>Rei let out a soft laugh as she placed  a card down on the table. “One Four. You'd be surprised.”</p>
<p>Haruka debated calling on Rei. She  herself had two fours, but the stack was getting rather large... it  was better not to risk it. “Two Fives. Now I really want to  know. Come on, relive the Kingdom days for us!”</p>
<p>Rei met Mina's glance with amusement,  shrugging as if to say, 'Your choice.'</p>
<p>Minako murmured, “One Six. And  again, I'd rather not talk about it.”</p>
<p>Makoto placed her cards down. “Two  Sevens. Bah, we'll pester you about it later if you don't tell us  now.”</p>
<p>Rei smirked. “Yes indeed.  Which path? Pester now, or tease later? One Eight.”</p>
<p>Haruka placed one card down without  anything more than her mandatory announcement. “One Nine.”</p>
<p>Minako growled softly as she placed  down a card. “One Ten. No.”</p>
<p>Makoto intoned, “Two Jacks.”</p>
<p>“Well, let's compromise. A  basic summary in return for no teasing hereafter. One Queen.”</p>
<p>Minako menacingly murmured, “BS  Rei.”</p>
<p>Rei noticeably flinched, looking from  the pile to Minako. “You sure about that?”</p>
<p>Noticing her hesitation, Minako  identified it and grinned in triumph. Carefully, she turned over the  last card, a Jack. Her grin widened. &quot;Pay up, Rei-sensei.”</p>
<p>Rei groaned as she took the pile of 21  cards and added it to her hand. She then took four silvers and a  bronze to pass over to Minako, who was positively giddy with having  beaten Rei in at least one round. “Gutsy luck.”</p>
<p>In her free hand, Minako held up the  pair of dice that Rei had given her between three fingers. “Nah,  I'm just gifted.”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her eyes softly as Haruka  continued on with her turn. The rest of the game was completed  without much rise. The thought of compromise had been forgotten by  the streak of correct calling of bluffs that had hit Rei. No lie  went unpunished, as she called every single one. Even small piles of  two or three cards had piled up, which ultimately left it to Mina and  Rei. Haruka and Makoto had both run down on their luck, neither  having succeeded in losing their cards before their money. After  their hands were added to the pile, Mina and Rei went head to head,  one card to one card. Not much later, they were both down to their  last cards, which meant that whoever called a correct bluff first,  would win.</p>
<p>“One Queen,” Rei murmured  softly.</p>
<p>Not having much choice, if she didn't  want Rei to win, Minako whispered, “BS.”</p>
<p>Her expression revealed nothing as Rei  slowly reached for the card, and painstakingly turned it over. It  was the Ace... of Hearts.</p>
<p>Smiling softly, Rei stood up.  “Congratulations Mina. I didn't expect it to drag out so  long... we should probably get ourselves some dinner soon.”</p>
<p>At that, Haruka yelped and stood up,  as did Makoto. “Dinner already? Geez, I had no idea. Come on  then Mako- let's see what the cooks are making without you.”</p>
<p>That was all the encouragement Makoto  needed to all but sprint out the door, with Haruka close at her  heels. Mina continued to sit, however, and watched as Rei gracefully  stretched. She was startled out of her reverie when Rei murmured  softly, “The Ace of Hearts... Didn't you say, once, that it was  your favorite card because it was Cupid's Arrow, with the A for Ace  also referring to 'Arrow'?”</p>
<p>While attempting to remember when she  had told Rei that, as it was as good as forbidden for cards to be  seen within the Palace walls, Mina replied, “Yeah. But when  did I-”</p>
<p>“Shh.” Rei froze, her  eyes darting around the room. “Do you feel that?”</p>
<p>“Wha-” But then Mina  stopped too, and her eyes widened in recognition. “Already?  But... but how?”</p>
<p>A single name left Rei's lips before  she quickly stalked out the door, Mina close in tow. “Setsuna.”</p>
