<h1>Best Friends (part 14 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Ami waited anxiously while Makoto showered and dressed.  She 
tried not to think too deeply about that, instead focusing her 
attention on the new group of basketball players arriving on the 
court.  Apparently, a women&#39;s team in one of the Sports Center 
leagues had reserved the court for practice, as about 15 tall 
young women were going through a variety of drills and shoot-
arounds. 

Unconsciously, Ami found herself staring at one player in 
particular.  She must have been almost 6 feet tall, with light 
brown hair, lithe and athletic.  Though she was only watching the 
woman run sprints, Ami still felt a twinge of guilt.  As fate 
would have it, at the precise moment that that little twinge 
brought a hint of pink to her cheeks, Makoto returned from the 
locker room.  &quot;Kenjo says that his dad told him once that you can 
always look, you just can&#39;t touch,&quot; Makoto whispered in an amused 
tone.

Ami nearly jumped into the air at the sound of Mako&#39;s voice in 
her ear and the feel of her breath on her skin.  &quot;I was... it 
wasn&#39;t...&quot; Ami stumbled to reply, as if she were a child caught 
with her hand in a cookie jar.  

Makoto brushed Ami&#39;s hair with her hand in a fond gesture and 
smiled reassuringly.  &quot;It&#39;s ok, Ami-chan, I&#39;m just teasing you.  
I watch this team play quite often.  They&#39;re very good, and some 
are very good looking.&quot;  Makoto directed Ami&#39;s attention to one 
of the point guards, immersed in a passing drill.  &quot;Personally, 
that one is more my type,&quot; she admitted.  The woman in question 
was about Ami&#39;s height with short black hair and a slender build.  

Blushing furiously, Ami smiled at her girlfriend, &quot;So, you&#39;re not 
jealous?&quot;

With a gentle laugh, Makoto tousled Ami&#39;s hair and drew her away 
from the court.  &quot;Ami-chan, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re attracted to women, 
particularly tall brunettes.  How could I be jealous?  She might 
have your eyes for a moment...&quot; she began.

&quot;But you have my heart, forever,&quot; Ami finished, slipping her arm 
around Makoto&#39;s waist.  Out of the corner of her eye, she noted 
some strange looks, some amused or intrigued, some disdainful, as 
they exited the Sports Center, but she didn&#39;t really care.  Ami 
had never put much stock in what other people thought of her, and 
she was simply too happy to care in any case.  

As they exited, Makoto suggested that they could get something to 
drink at a coffee shop next door.  Ami agreed and they soon found 
themselves seated at a cozy table for two in the back of the 
shop.  Makoto had changed into a long brown skirt with a red, 
sleeveless blouse.  A white sweater provided some protection from 
autumn&#39;s chill.  Thoughts of any other woman fled from Ami&#39;s mind 
as she caught herself taking every opportunity to stare at this 
lovely creature across from her.  

&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Ami whispered to herself.  Makoto heard 
her, however, and lowered her eyes shyly.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you think so,&quot; Makoto murmured, &quot;I hope that I can be 
as beautiful to you as you are to me.&quot;  

Ami did not drop her gaze.  Normally, she was quite shy and, in 
the past, any hint of romance had sent her heart aflutter and 
discombobulated her completely.  With Makoto, though, she felt a 
surge of confidence and security.  This was right; this was how 
things should be.  True, she did blush and feel shy at times, but 
for entirely new reasons.  She reached out and took Makoto&#39;s hand 
just as she had at the restaurant the night before.  &quot;As I told 
them at the game, you are the most beautiful woman in the world.&quot;

Makoto thrilled to hear Ami talk like that about her.  She&#39;d 
never really considered herself beautiful.  With friends as 
obviously gorgeous as Usagi, Rei, Minako, and especially Ami 
herself, Makoto had always placed herself at the back of the 
pack. A chill spread across her skin, increasing as Ami began to 
stroke her hand with her thumbs, a gesture that was becoming 
increasingly endearing to her.  Ami made her feel like a 
princess.  No, that wasn&#39;t quite it.  Ami made her feel like a 
woman; she made her feel comfortable in herself in a way that no 
one else, even Kenjo, ever had.  All of those fantasies about 
being a bride, a wife, a mother came flashing back.  Though she&#39;d 
decided previously that a life with her true love was more 
important than such ideals, Makoto now understood that she could 
still have all of those things and so much more.  

&quot;Were you surprised I came to watch you play?&quot; Ami asked gently.

&quot;Truthfully?&quot; Makoto asked with a wary smile.

&quot;Always truthfully, my love,&quot; Ami answered.

Another shiver went down Makoto&#39;s back.  &quot;Well, you kind of threw 
me off my game.  Especially with Minako-chan cheering on Kenjo-
chan like that.  When I saw you, I wanted to...well, I wanted to 
impress you.&quot; 

&quot;Silly Mako-chan,&quot; Ami giggled, &quot;you don&#39;t need to impress me.  
Now, tell me, who really won?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes went wide, &quot;But, we told you, it was a tie.&quot;  

Ami simply raised an eyebrow, waiting for a better answer. 

Makoto laughed sheepishly, &quot;I suppose I should have known better 
than to think that we could pull one over on you.  If you must 
know...&quot;

Ami held up her hand, &quot;No, on second thought, I don&#39;t want to 
know.  That&#39;s between you and him.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, I 
was the big winner.&quot;  She blushed slightly, recalling the feel of 
Makoto&#39;s tongue sliding across her own, the weight of Makoto&#39;s 
chest pressed against her own.  &quot;I don&#39;t suppose we have time... 
to...pick up where we left off?&quot;  Underneath the table, Ami 
slowly slid her stockinged foot across Makoto&#39;s ankle.  

&quot;Ami-chan!&quot; Makoto declared. &quot;What&#39;s gotten into you?&quot;  She felt 
quite flush as Ami generated chills that ran up and down her legs 
to match the ones on her arms and spine.  Indeed, Makoto shivered 
quite visibly. 

Ami&#39;s eyes smoldered as she caught Makoto&#39;s gaze, &quot;Well, I was 
just thinking...&quot;

Makoto leaned across the table and kissed her friend on the 
forehead.  &quot;I know what you&#39;re thinking!&quot;  Loving the blush she 
got in response, Makoto continued regretfully, &quot;I have a lunch 
date with Kenjo-chan. I need to get the goods on him and Mina-
chan.  They seemed quite cozy together, didn&#39;t you think?&quot;

Ami laughed, &quot;Yes, and good for them.  Maybe we can double date 
sometime.  I&#39;d like to get to know him better, especially since 
he&#39;s such an important part of your life.&quot;   With a deep sigh, 
Ami became suddenly serious.  &quot;I don&#39;t know what I was thinking 
anyway, I have an appointment this afternoon.&quot;  Ami explained 
about the visit to the psychiatrist that her mother had arranged.

As Ami described her mother&#39;s reactions, not to mention the 
nature of this so-called &quot;Quality Time&quot;, Makoto felt her ire 
rising.  It took much of her strength of will to resist blowing 
up.  She didn&#39;t like injustice and she especially didn&#39;t like it 
when anyone mistreated her friends.  Still, Ami needed support 
and Makoto suspected that if she got mad, Ami might respond by 
trying to defend her mother.  She certainly didn&#39;t want Ami in 
that frame of mind.  Instead, she tried in vain to think of an 
alternate solution to the immediate problem.

&quot;You could just go and say the kind of things that people like 
that want to hear,&quot; Makoto suggested half-heartedly.

&quot;We both know that won&#39;t work,&quot; Ami replied softly, &quot;and that&#39;s 
not the problem.  I have to deal with my mother eventually.  I 
might as well do it today.  There&#39;s no sense in putting it off.&quot;

Makoto squeezed Ami&#39;s hands and gave her a supportive smile.  
&quot;You can do it, Ami-chan.  You&#39;re one of the strongest people I 
know.&quot;  Seeing that Ami was on the right track set her mind at 
ease immensely.  

With a skeptical snicker, Ami corrected her, &quot;You are the strong 
one.  It&#39;s your job to protect me, after all.  I wish you could 
this time, but I don&#39;t think you can.&quot;  The serious expression on 
Makoto&#39;s face made her pause.

&quot;You are a strong woman, Mizuno Ami.  Don&#39;t you dare imply 
otherwise.  That&#39;s my girlfriend you&#39;re disparaging and I won&#39;t 
just sit here and let you do it!&quot;

Makoto&#39;s earnest expression, the love and pride in her eyes, the 
determined set of her jaw, overwhelmed Ami.  She couldn&#39;t 
remember ever feeling so loved, so safe.  The only occasions that 
even came close were those few times when she and the other 
senshi had joined their powers as one.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mako-chan, I 
won&#39;t do it again,&quot; she promised meekly.

Makoto grunted, &quot;Damn right you won&#39;t, or I&#39;ll have to punish 
you.&quot; 

&quot;In the name of the moon?&quot; Ami prompted sweetly.

&quot;In the name of _me_,&quot; Makoto replied with a fierce grin.  All of 
her seriousness faded in an instant as she reached forward to 
caress Ami&#39;s cheek.  &quot;You handle her, and when you&#39;re done, come 
home.  I&#39;ll have a nice dinner waiting for you, among other 
things.&quot;  She winked at Ami saucily.  

&quot;Having that to look forward to should be all the incentive I 
need to resolve things,&quot; Ami declared. &quot;What would I ever do 
without you, my dear Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;How about we never find out?&quot; Makoto suggested.  &quot;Now, you have 
an appointment to keep, and not with some headshrinker, and I 
have a lunch date.&quot;

&quot;Do you think he&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s going on with Mina-chan?&quot; Ami 
inquired.  She was immensely curious to know.  The fact that 
Minako and Kenjo seemed to be finding each other at the same time 
that she and Makoto were had not been lost on Ami.  She was 
anxious to compare notes with Minako and to find out how far 
they&#39;d gone.  That idea opened up other lines of thought that 
threatened to raise Ami&#39;s pulse rate too quickly, so she tried to 
drop it.  In passing she wondered why she was so.... well, as 
crude as it sounded, she had to be honest with herself... why she 
was so randy all the time lately!  

Makoto nodded, &quot;Oh, he&#39;ll tell me, if only because he&#39;ll want to 
know all the juicy details about you and I.&quot;  

&quot;Do you really talk about such things with him?&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;We always have,&quot; Makoto admitted, &quot;but if you&#39;d rather I didn&#39;t 
tell him anything, I won&#39;t.  There will always be things we don&#39;t 
share, details about things at least, mostly because neither of 
us really wants to know that much.&quot;

Ami shook her head, &quot;No, please don&#39;t change your friendship to 
suit me.  I trust you completely, Mako-chan.&quot;  The weight of that 
statement hit Ami, so she repeated it more carefully to make sure 
they both understood.  &quot;I trust you completely.&quot;

Again, Makoto dropped her eyes shyly.  &quot;I trust you too, Ami-
chan.&quot;  They sat together, silently holding hands, letting the 
comforting depth of their love envelop them both.  Finally, 
Makoto realized they could no longer linger in the moment.   
Unfinished business stood between them and this evening, and 
nothing could be allowed to stand between the two of them any 
longer.  &quot;I should get going, and you should too.&quot; She rose and 
drew Ami with her out of the shop.  On the sidewalk, she gave Ami 
a warm hug. &quot;Till tonight?&quot;

&quot;Till tonight,&quot; Ami agreed.  Unsatisfied with a simple hug, as 
scrumptious as it was, Ami pulled Makoto down in a torrid, if all 
too brief, kiss.  &quot;Tonight,&quot; she said again with firm resolve.  

Makoto felt her knees go weak in the face of the desire flaring 
behind Ami&#39;s eyes.  She could sense her own longings responding 
in kind.  With a firm shake of her head, she marshaled her 
willpower and headed away with a wave and a knowing smile.  

Ami watched her go with some regret but also renewed purpose.  
She knew would need all of that energy to deal with Mom, but for 
the first time she felt certain that she&#39;d be able to do it.  

---------------------
Walking in a daze, Makoto found her way home.  So many happy 
thoughts floated through her mind that she found it hard to focus 
on any one in particular.  Ami loved her.  Ami had kissed her.  
Ami was coming over tonight.  Ami was her girlfriend.  She was 
Ami&#39;s girlfriend.  Two of her very best friends seemed to be 
falling in love.  Ami thought she was beautiful.  Ami wanted her, 
maybe almost as much as she wanted Ami.  

Her mind darting between these and other images, Makoto unloaded 
her gym bag and took care of a few chores around the house.  
She&#39;d have time after lunch to clean more thoroughly, though 
truthfully, her place never got very dirty or disordered to begin 
with.  She needed to come up with a new idea, though.  Years of 
fantasizing about the ideal romantic dinner with the man of her 
dreams (ok, so some things had changed) had resulted in the 
candles last Wednesday.  She&#39;d never really bothered to think 
about how to prepare for a second romantic dinner.  It had always 
seemed like one would be enough.  

&#39;We could eat Chinese take-out from little white paper boxes 
over the sink and it would still be the most romantic dinner of 
my life,&#39; Makoto decided.  Inspiration would come.  Perhaps Kenjo 
would have some ideas.  For a guy, he could be quite romantic.  
It was one of the reasons she&#39;d known that he and Minako would 
hit it off so well.  For all of her spunky, take-charge attitude, 
Makoto knew that Minako had a very romantic soul.  Perhaps that 
came with the job, she considered since, upon reflection, all of 
the senshi did, even the Outers. 
	
A few moments later, the doorbell rang and Makoto went to let 
Kenjo in.  He stood in the foyer, looking around while she got 
her sweater.  &quot;Your place looks as great as ever, Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;Thanks! Take a good look, I might need your decorating advice 
later,&quot; Makoto requested.  

&quot;Thinking of rearranging the furniture or painting?&quot;

&quot;No, nothing major, just something romantic for tonight,&quot; Makoto 
replied with a broad grin.  

They stepped into the hall and headed for the elevator.  
&quot;So, you and Ami-san are having dinner together?&quot;

Makoto nodded, &quot;Yep, but we can talk about all of that later.  
First, I want all the dirt on you and Mina-chan!&quot;  

Laughing, Kenjo agreed. &quot;Ok, I promised to tell all when we got 
together today.  Besides, I know you can&#39;t wait to tell me, so 
we&#39;ll see how long you can hold out.  Is she a better kisser than 
me?&quot;

Makoto punched him hard on the arm.  &quot;You jerk, you and I only 
kissed a couple times and it was a long time ago.  Yes, she is, 
but I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve gotten better over the years.  The way Mina-
chan couldn&#39;t wait to get at you would indicate that you have.&quot;

Kenjo rubbed his arm, smiling shyly.  &quot;She&#39;s really great, Mako-
chan.  Everything you said, and so much more.  I&#39;m kinda 
worried.&quot;

&quot;Worried?&quot; Makoto asked as they hit the street.   She decided to 
lead him to a nice place not too far away.  The food wasn&#39;t the 
best in the city, but it was good enough and the set up was 
perfect to allow for long conversations.  

The normal tone of jest and banter that characterized their 
conversations was gone when Kenjo replied.  &quot;I think I could fall 
for her, Mako-chan.  Hard.&quot;

Makoto hugged herself to his arm as they walked.  &quot;If you think 
you could, it probably means you already have.&quot;

Kenjo chuckled.  &quot;I guess.  I mean, we&#39;ve only seen each other 
twice, well three times counting today.  Two and a half.  There&#39;s 
just something about her.&quot;

&quot;You remember who she is, don&#39;t you?&quot; Makoto asked slyly.

After a moment&#39;s hesitation, Kenjo answered, &quot;The Senshi of Love, 
I know.  She doesn&#39;t know that I know, of course.&quot;  He laughed 
suddenly, &quot;How can I stand up against that?&quot;

&quot;Do you really mind?&quot; Makoto skeptically pointed out.

&quot;No, not really,&quot; he admitted.  For the rest of their walk, he 
related the events of their two dates.  Makoto asked which songs 
Minako had chosen, smiling knowingly to herself as he told her.  
When he got to the end of their second date, they had arrived and 
been seated at the restaurant.  After ordering, he finished his 
story.

&quot;So, she pulled me along behind her to this little playground and 
sat down on one of the swings,&quot; Kenjo related.

Makoto grinned, &quot;She&#39;s always sitting on those things.  It&#39;s 
where she goes when she has some serious thinking to do.  Artemis 
told me once that if we ever needed to find her, if we were 
worried about her, we should look there first.&quot;

&quot;Artemis?&quot;

&quot;Her talking cat,&quot; Makoto whispered, realizing how odd that 
sounded, though it was the most normal thing in the world to her 
now.  

She&#39;d told him about Luna at one point, so Kenjo was not too 
surprised, though he wasn&#39;t sure what he thought about having a 
girlfriend with a talking (male) cat.  He decided not to worry 
about it, at least not until he met the cat.

&quot;So, anyway, I pushed her on the swings a bit and then I helped 
her up...&quot;

&quot;And?&quot; Makoto encouraged him to continue, sensing that he was 
getting to the good parts.

&quot;And I took her in my arms and I kissed her,&quot; Kenjo concluded.

Makoto beamed at him. &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you, Kenjo-chan.  I just 
knew that the two of you would hit it off.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, but now I have to leave for the rest of the semester,&quot; he 
lamented.  

&quot;Oh grow up, it&#39;s only a month or so and you&#39;ve certainly gone 
longer with out getting any!&quot; Makoto teased. &quot;Besides, you&#39;ve 
heard of email and phones, right?&quot;

Kenjo gave her a nasty look, but they both knew he didn&#39;t mean 
it.  &quot;Ok, enough about me, what&#39;s this with you and Ami-san?&quot;

&quot;Ami-san?&quot; Makoto raised an eyebrow questioningly.

&quot;Well, I know I don&#39;t really know her, but she is dating one of 
my best friends, and I guess I&#39;m dating one of hers, so...&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m just teasing.  She certainly wouldn&#39;t mind.  And don&#39;t 
you act so surprised.  I understand that you&#39;ve been up to things 
this week.&quot;

Kenjo eventually admitted what had initially lain behind his 
desire to have dinner with Minako, telling his friend about what 
he&#39;d noticed, and why, and how he&#39;d tried to help.  As he 
explained, Makoto was taken aback by how very much he wanted her 
to be happy, how very much he and all of her friends loved her.  

&quot;I&#39;m not really sorry I did what I did, and it wasn&#39;t like I was 
betraying a confidence, since I knew before you,&quot; Kenjo pointed 
out as Makoto rolled her eyes (she&#39;d seen that coming!).  
&quot;Anyway, I think that it might have helped.  I understand that 
guy Urawa tried to cause some trouble.&quot;

&quot;Did cause some trouble,&quot; Makoto sighed.  She told him all about 
what Urawa had done and how Ami&#39;s mom had reacted.  &quot;Right about 
now she&#39;s supposed to be seeing this doctor.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not going to, is she?&quot; 

&quot;No, I think she&#39;s going to talk to her mom and try to sort 
things out.  I don&#39;t know what she&#39;ll say, but I know she&#39;ll do 
it.  She certainly took care of Urawa, though I&#39;m not exactly 
sure what she said to him.  I guess I&#39;ll find out tonight.&quot;

Kenjo gave her a provocative look, &quot;So, tonight huh?  And what 
exactly do you plan to do with your new girlfriend tonight?&quot;  

&quot;Nothing like that, no more than you&#39;re planning to take Mina-
chan to some seedy hotel room!&quot; Makoto retorted.

&quot;Point taken,&quot; Kenjo conceded.  &quot;No reason to rush things, 
especially when kissing is so much fun all by itself.&quot;  His eyes 
drifted off momentarily as he recalled the scent of Minako&#39;s hair 
and the playful way she nipped his lower lip when he tried to 
break a kiss.  

Makoto didn&#39;t notice Kenjo&#39;s distraction, since she was lost in 
her own wonderland remembering the feel of Ami&#39;s toe on her ankle 
and the look in her eyes.  &#39;I can&#39;t believe it was her,&#39; she 
muttered.

&quot;What can&#39;t you believe, Mako-chan?&quot; Kenjo asked.  Makoto 
grimaced as she realized she&#39;d said that out loud.  Well, maybe 
he would have some insight, she decided.

&quot;I thought I knew Ami-chan better than anyone.  I still think I 
do, but she&#39;s been...it&#39;s hard to explain.&quot;

&quot;She was your friend, now she&#39;s your girlfriend,&quot; Kenjo 
theorized.  &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you expect her to act differently?&quot;

&quot;Of course, but, well...&quot; Makoto took a deep breath.  &quot;I never 
suspected she&#39;d be so passionate, in public anyway!  I think if 
I&#39;d agreed, she would have dragged me into an alley and ravished 
me this morning.&quot;

Kenjo laughed, then stopped when he saw that she was serious. 
Thinking about it, and what little he knew about Ami, he asked, 
&quot;Mako-chan, has she ever had a boyfriend?  You know, a real 
boyfriend?&quot;  

Makoto replied quickly, &quot;No, not really.  I don&#39;t think she ever 
did anything but spend time with Urawa.  I doubt she even ever 
kissed him.&quot;   As she said it, it came to her.  

Kenjo realized it as well.  &quot;Mako-chan, that probably means that 
today was....&quot;

&quot;Her first kiss?&quot; Makoto concluded.  &quot;Her first real kiss, ever.&quot;  
The weight of that settled onto her.  

&quot;More than that, Mako-chan,&quot; Kenjo went on, &quot;she&#39;s twenty years 
old and for all this time, through the entirety of her raging-
hormone teenage years, she&#39;s kept that side of her bottled up 
completely.  Now, she&#39;s in a place where it&#39;s safe for her to 
finally explore that part of herself... difficult territory for 
you, I&#39;d say.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s probably never even...&#39; Makoto thought, blushing at 
memories of her own &#39;individual experiences&#39; and thoughts of Ami 
doing similar things.  She looked up at Kenjo with a mix of 
horror and amazement.  &quot;The poor sweet girl!&quot;

Knowing he was surfing dangerous waters, Kenjo did not reply but 
waited patiently for Makoto to sort things out. 

&quot;I think tonight might be a little more complicated than I 
thought,&quot; Makoto realized. &quot;I remember my first time alone with 
my old sempai.  Once he got me revved up, it was all I could do 
to stop myself before taking things way beyond a point I would 
have been comfortable with the next day.&quot;  

&quot;It gets easier, with experience, but she doesn&#39;t have any,&quot; 
Kenjo added.  &quot;She&#39;s also not a hormone-addled teenager, so that 
will make things easier on both of you.  Just take it slow and 
you&#39;ll both be fine.&quot;

Makoto nodded.  She could imagine what it might have been like if 
she&#39;d allowed her own desires to overwhelm her.  As wonderful as 
it would be to take Ami to her bed and make love to her all 
night, she knew that Ami couldn&#39;t be ready for that, after only 
having kissed anyone once or twice.  Truthfully, it was new 
territory for her as well.  Though Makoto was no virgin, she&#39;d 
never been with a woman and, though she could imagine (and had!) 
how things might progress, she would also be feeling her way at 
first.  The unintended pun brought a blush to her face.

&quot;Just remember, my friend,&quot; Kenjo advised, &quot;the important thing 
is that you love each other.&quot;  

Makoto grinned, feeling more at ease.  She felt quite thankful 
that she&#39;d kept her lunch date for a variety of reasons now.  

&quot;Well, I should go home and get my stuff together.  I need to 
pack up for the trip back and Minako will be picking me up in a 
couple hours.&quot;  Kenjo grinned.  &quot;She&#39;s walking me to the train 
station to see me off.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s almost as much of a sappy romantic as you are,&quot; Makoto 
noted. &quot;Email me or call me when you get back to school.  More 
importantly, email _and_ call her.&quot;

&quot;As if I could help myself.  Don&#39;t they have a winter formal just 
after exams at her school?  Maybe she&#39;ll invite me,&quot; Kenjo hoped.

&quot;And maybe Ami will invite me and we can double-date!  She said 
she wants to get to know you better.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that, too,&quot; Kenjo agreed.  He pulled out his wallet and 
took care of the check while Makoto pulled on her sweater.  

&quot;I thought we tied,&quot; she asked sarcastically.

Kenjo replied by flipping her the bird.  &quot;Next time, Mako-chan... 
next time.&quot;  Makoto simply laughed.  After a farewell embrace and 
appropriate words, they parted, sorry to say goodbye but looking 
forward to what the evening would bring.
