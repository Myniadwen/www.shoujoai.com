to burn.&quot;~ Lestat, from the novel Queen of the Damned
 
 
Rei was frozen still, her breathing shallow and quick, her eyes riveted 
on the wall in front of her.
 
&quot;Afraid?&quot; Serenity asked, seeming concerned, oddly enough.
 
If Rei could have found it in her to speak, she would have told the 
vampire to fuck off. Instead, she sufficed with a slow shake of her 
head.
 
Serenity raised an eyebrow. &quot;No? Odd...you are very brave.&quot; She looked 
wide-eyed and innocent all of a sudden, and Rei wished she could crawl 
into a corner somewhere.
 
Serenity smiled, trailing her finger along Rei&#146;s jawline, causing the 
woman to tense. &quot;Poor dear,&quot; Serenity murmured. &quot;Perhaps...I should 
unfreeze you?&quot;
 
She snapped her fingers once more, and Rei fell down in a heap.
 
As quickly as possible, Rei rolled away from the vampire and pulled her 
gun out of its holster.
 
The safety clicked off.
 
&quot;Dumbest thing you could&#146;ve done, you bitch,&quot; she growled, pulling the 
trigger.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Kazuki slipped from Setsuna&#146;s arms as quietly as possible, moving to 
find her clothes. She absentmindedly ran her fingers over a bright red 
bite mark right below her collarbone and smirked.
 
&quot;She&#146;s always so over-zealous...&quot;
 
Padding across Setsuna&#146;s room with bare feet, she gathered the rest of 
her clothes and slipped them on, being careful not to make any noise.
 
&quot;...Going somewhere?&quot; Setsuna murmured sleepily.
 
Kazuki uttered a curse under her breath.
 
&quot;Actually, I was, if you don&#146;t mind. I haven&#146;t seen the others in so 
long...&quot; 
 
Setsuna chuckled low in her throat.
 
&quot;If I didn&#146;t know better, I would think you found me stupid, love. I&#146;m 
older than you, and I know your tricks. Sit down.&quot;
 
Kazuki sat back down, muttering under her breath.
 
Setsuna chuckled again, and sat down next to Kazuki, running her fingers 
through the other woman&#146;s hair.
 
&quot;Why do you have to kill her?&quot;
 
Kazuki looked down, clenching her fists.
 
&quot;She has given us death. Forced us to become murderers...simply to 
survive.&quot;
 
Setsuna sighed weakly.
 
&quot;Death yes, but perhaps it can be seen as a new life? And love, if you 
must die, would it be better to die with me?&quot;
 
&quot;But...&quot;
 
Setsuna moved her fingers to Kazuki&#146;s lips, silencing her.
 
&quot;Hush,&quot; she whispered, pulling her back down onto the bed, &quot;and die a 
little death with me?&quot;
 
From the corner of her eye, she saw a single tear trace down Kazuki&#146;s 
cheek, and she gently kissed it away.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Makoto stared at the blue-haired doctor with more than a bit of pity.
 
&quot;Hey, I&#146;m not going to kill you.&quot;
 
Ami sighed in relief, and Hotaru frowned a little, shaking her head. 
Makoto ignored her, scratching her head and staring at Ami curiously.
 
&quot;What are you doing here anyway?&quot;
 
Ami shuffled from side to side, staring at Makoto warily.
 
&quot;I...I&#146;m here to find Miss Hino.&quot;
 
Makoto&#146;s ears pricked slightly. &quot;Hmm...sounds like she just shot someone.&quot; 
Hotaru&#146;s eyes widened. &quot;Milady! We have to save her!&quot; She tried to run, 
but Makoto grabbed her.
 
&quot;Calm down. Besides, it&#146;s not like it&#146;ll work. That detective shot me 
more times than I care to remember, and I&#146;m still here.&quot; She turned to 
Ami. &quot;You should leave.&quot;
 
Ami steeled herself. &quot;No...I won&#146;t be leaving until I&#146;ve found Miss Hino. 
I don&#146;t care if I have to...face all of you...creatures, but I&#146;m not going 
to just run away.&quot;
 
&quot;I wonder...&quot; a silky voice murmured from within the shadows, &quot;...how well 
she&#146;ll fare against more than two of us &#145;creatures.&#146;&quot;
 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; said another voice.
 
Ami felt the blood drain from her face as Haruka and Michiru stepped out 
of the shadows. Haruka chuckled slightly under her breath, and Michiru 
smiled at Ami.
 
&quot;Remember us dear?&quot; 
 
Ami looked around slowly, feeling her heart rate increase. She was 
surrounded. Well, she mused, at least you&#146;ll die knowing you tried to 
save Miss Hino. Suddenly, an idea came to her.
 
&quot;Umm...your leader was just shot by the detective!&quot;
 
Haruka&#146;s eyes widened, but Michiru for the most part, seemed 
unconcerned.
 
&quot;Don&#146;t worry Haruka. The detective will pay for her foolishness.&quot;
 
Haruka frowned for a moment and then chuckled, closing her eyes.
 
&quot;Nice try.&quot;
 
Hotaru frowned, raising her hand to her chin in thought.
 
&quot;Well, we can&#146;t all share her, can we? There isn&#146;t enough blood to go 
around...&quot;
 
Haruka scoffed. &quot;Well, I think Michiru and I should get her.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#146;s not fair!&quot;

&quot;Life isn&#146;t fair.&quot;

&quot;We saw her first!&quot; 

&quot;Doesn&#146;t matter.&quot;
 
Ami took this chance to slip away, hoping that none of the women would 
notice she was missing.
 
The vampires continued to bicker. 
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Rei didn&#146;t stop shooting until there weren&#146;t any bullets left. She 
stared at the still form of Usagi, forcing down the sudden quell of 
nausea. Turning away from the vampire, she slumped to the ground, 
shaking slightly.
 
Run! A voice in her head screamed. She&#146;s going to get up...Rei held the 
gun close to her chest, and shook her head in disbelief as she heard the 
metallic clank of the bullets hitting the ground.
 
&quot;Impossible...&quot; she whispered, shaking her head, &quot;it&#146;s just impossible...&quot; A 
groan from Serenity made her turn, and she stared in a mixture of horror 
and amazement as the bullet wounds closed over. Serenity clicked her 
tongue at the detective. &quot;Silly thing to do, don&#146;t you think?&quot; she asked 
airily, the only hint of her growing anger in her eyes. 
 
Run.
 
&quot;Too late...&quot; Serenity whispered, leaning down to touch Rei&#146;s cheek. 
&quot;There is nothing you can do. Even if you were able to escape my 
chamber, my children would capture you easily.&quot;
 
&quot;Why do you care anyway? I&#146;ll never tell anyone that I found you...I 
swear...&quot;
 
&quot;I know you won&#146;t. But that isn&#146;t why I&#146;m keeping you here.&quot;
 
&quot;Why then?&quot;
 
&quot;You fascinate me...never have I seen a being such as you.&quot;

Rei blinked. &quot;Me? Why?&quot;
 
Serenity stared into Rei&#146;s eyes, as if she was searching for something.
 
&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; She gripped Rei&#146;s shoulders, and held fast when she 
started to struggle.
 
&quot;Don&#146;t be afraid.&quot; She moved her head down to Rei&#146;s neck, ignoring it 
when the woman tensed. Slowly, very slowly, Rei ceased her struggles, 
and Serenity sighed in relief.
 
Rei&#146;s eyes widened and she gasped when she felt Serenity&#146;s fangs pierce 
the skin on the nape of her neck.
 
~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~
 
Minako sat on the roof of Serenity&#146;s mansion, not wanting to enter yet. 
Staring up at the moon, she wondered if what she had done had been the 
right thing. Truly, she mused, pining after a love one can never have 
is...foolish. She wiped her eyes on the sleeve of her trench coat, and 
sighed, staring down below. She quirked an eyebrow when she saw Ami run 
out of the mansion.
 
&quot;Odd...you there!&quot; she called, startling the blue-haired girl. Ami stopped 
dead in her tracks and looked around frantically.
 
&quot;I&#146;m up here!&quot; Minako called, waving down from the roof. Even from a 
distance, she could see Ami&#146;s expression contort into blind fear.
 
&quot;I won&#146;t hurt you! Please, just stay there, I&#146;m coming down!&quot; With the 
skill of an acrobat, she hopped down from the roof, landing on her feet 
in front of Ami.
 
Ami took a step back, and Minako felt another part of her heart break.
 
&quot;Please...don&#146;t fear me...I need you to relay a message to someone.&quot;
 
Ami seemed to think on it for a moment, and then took a deep breath.
 
&quot;What is it?&quot;
 
Minako grinned, and Ami inwardly winced when she saw her fangs. &quot;Her 
name...is Mitsuki. She has a horrible beast of a puppy named Fenrir, and 
her hair is as white as the first snow of winter. Her eyes are so many 
greens at once that&#146;s it&#146;s hard to explain them, and they sparkle when 
she laughs. She&#146;s a light sleeper, and her voice is very soft and kind 
when she speaks to that godforsaken dog.&quot; Minako&#146;s eyes misted over 
again.
 
&quot;I want you to find her, and tell her what I am. And...that I love her. 
Please, time for our clan grows short. Soon, he will return and take our 
Queen, and we will be forced to follow. Just tell her that for me...&quot;

Ami nodded her head, not quite understanding, but agreeing to it all the 
same.
 
&quot;You have my word.&quot;

&quot;Thank you.&quot;
