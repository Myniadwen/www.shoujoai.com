<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 30 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><p><u> (City Entrance, Rei)</u></p><p>It was early morning when Rei and Minako finally 
returned to the meeting place, and when they arrived they were taken aback by the condition 
their friends were in; the majority of the others were in considerably worse shape than 
either of them were.</p><p>Haruka was hunched over on the ground and was covered by a 
multitude of small cuts that littered her arms and legs. Michiru was sitting right beside 
her. She was quiet, but she carried a handful of large, blackening bruises and an enormous 
gash on her left side just below her ribs. A few meters away to the right of the pair, both 
Luna and Ami were currently tending Jupiter’s wounds. Makoto’s partner was essentially 
spot-free of injury, strongly indicating that she had already received treatment, however 
her sparring partner was covered by dark bruises all along her upper body—it looked as 
though she had been peppered by stones. The last of the bodies in the area were Artemis and 
Setsuna; the man was steadying the former advisor against his side.</p><p>“Wow...What 
happened to everyone?” Minako whispered to Rei.</p><p>The Martian scanned the group with her 
remaining, open eye and offered a small shrug. “What we did I suppose…but 
worse.”</p><p><i>But it looks like we’re still missing two...</i> Upon remembering Usagi and 
Hotaru’s last confrontation, Rei was inclined to expect the worst. <i>Those two...! They 
couldn’t have, could they...? </i></p><p>“Hey, Rei...? I think… Usagi and Hotaru are 
missing. I don’t see them anywhere.”</p><p>“We’re right here.” A weak voice spoke 
up.</p><p>The spoken party had just exited the city. Usagi was supporting Hotaru, allowing 
her to lean onto her side as she limped towards the group.</p><p>“Hotaru?!” Minako cried. 
“What happened?!” <i>Her wound...that doesn’t look very good!</i></p><p>“Lady Usagi! Lady 
Hotaru!” Luna left Jupiter’s side and went to greet the pair. She cringed when she saw the 
state that they were in, especially Hotaru’s; the dark-haired heir was deathly pale. She had 
broken out into a sweat and was barely holding onto consciousness-- a feat, alone, that the 
vice advisor considered a miracle judging by the blood loss and shock she was suffering due 
to the gaping hole in her side. Usagi’s medical treatment had stopped the bleeding but it 
hadn’t been enough.</p><p>“We must move her into the palace’s medical ward and treat her 
wounds immediately!”</p><p>It was eerily quiet as Usagi slowly escorted her limping sister 
away with Luna, with Artemis and Setsuna following closely beside them. They were all 
injured, but a wound like Hotaru’s was ridiculous for a practice match.</p><p>“I hope she’ll 
be okay...” Minako thought aloud. She hadn’t taken her eyes off of Hotaru’s back this entire 
time and Rei had noticed.</p><p>“She’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Hotaru’s a strong 
person...” She muttered as she stepped into the space between Haruka, Michiru and Makoto. 
Rei took a deep breath and began to concentrate. As she did, a soft crimson glow began to 
light up around her—it was somehow different than what Minako had sensed in the battlefield. 
It was almost gentle somehow. “I still have some power left, so... I’m going to stay here 
and help with the first aid while Luna’s gone. If you want, you can go and help them out. 
I’m sure they could use it.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Minako asked in surprise.</p><p>“...Why 
not? You and Hotaru are friends, right? Besides...I thought a babysitter’s job was never 
finished.”</p><p>“You--” She walked up behind her and gave her a playful slap on the back, 
momentarily breaking Rei’s concentration. “She’s older now, even old than me in fact. But 
all right... I think I actually will go help them out. You got everything covered 
here?”</p><p>“Mm...”</p><p>“All right, then I’ll catch you later, okay?”</p><p>“Uh huh...” 
Rei muttered as the blonde left. As soon as she was gone, she activated her spell; in a 
blink of an eye, thin, red threads shot outwards from her feet and snaked along the ground 
to form a circular pattern with Mars’s insignia at its center. With a meditative focus, Rei 
initiated the final sequence and eased the restraints on her powers--her remaining energy 
spilled out began to flow freely through the marked guidelines. The entire circle 
illuminated the area, and consequently began to heal the injured within its 
influence.</p><p>“That’s a good idea Rei. Here, let me help.” She was quickly joined by Ami, 
who also spread her sphere of influence outward until it overlapped with Rei’s. The healing 
rate of their combined spells jumped significantly.</p><p>Up ahead, Minako had reached Usagi 
and Luna. “Hey!” She shouted, and they both turned their heads at her. “Do you need a 
hand?”</p><p>“Minako? Well, this is a surprise. What are you doing here?” Artemis 
asked.</p><p>As Minako ran up, she saw her ‘twin’ look up at her with inquiring eyes. After 
all, why would Minako help her? They hardly knew one another and she had the feeling that 
the other woman didn’t like her that much.</p><p>“Well...”</p><p>“I thought that we could 
speed things up a little. If I helped Usagi carry her, then maybe Luna can concentrate on 
healing her. Here,” she walked right up and Luna stepped aside as she enthusiastically took 
her place at Hotaru’s side. When she still saw that look of surprise on Usagi’s face, she 
smiled and said, “Hotaru is a dear friend of mine, so...I’d like to help her in any way I 
can.”</p><p>“That’s very thoughtful of you.” Artemis beamed. “But what about the others...? 
Do you think they’ll be all right without your help?”</p><p>“Psh, they’ll be fine!” Minako 
grinned. “Rei has it covered.”</p><p>Usagi’s expression softened at the mention of the name. 
“I see. Well then, thank you. I appreciate your help Minako.”</p><p>“It’s no problem! No 
problem at all! But ahh… what about Setsuna? If you don’t mind me saying this, she doesn’t 
look too well…”</p><p>“Oh, she’ll be fine.” Artemis smiled. “She just pushed herself a 
little too hard, but with some rest she’ll recover. But just in case, I’ll come with you 
girls and let her rest in the medical ward. It’ll be easier for Luna to monitor both 
patients if they’re in one place rather than having her run between floors.”</p><p>“That’s 
great idea!” Minako agreed. “That way, she won’t get tired out!”</p><p>Artemis reddened a 
little and smiled nervously at the praise. <i>It was nothing, really.</i></p><p>“This is 
very nice and all, but do I need to remind you that we have patients to treat?” Luna 
growled. <i>Are you trying to say that I’m not in shape?</i></p><p>“N-No ma’am.” They all 
muttered.</p><p>As the second group disappeared out of sight, Haruka found herself chuckling 
to herself. The majority of her bruises and minor cuts were almost entirely healed 
now.</p><p>“So, Rei… What happened to you? It looks like Minako gave you quite the beating!” 
She laughed.</p><p>“If you’re so talkative, then why don’t you heal yourself?” Rei 
retorted.</p><p>“Hmm…I would if I could. But I’ve already exhausted all of my energy… so... 
I sadly, can’t. I think Michiru has too.” She quickly added.</p><p>Rei peered over at the 
Goddess but Michiru said nothing. The Martian inwardly sighed; she knew that she wouldn’t 
likely hear a thank you from the woman anytime soon, even if she were in dying need of 
medical aid. Sometimes Rei even wondered why she even bothered thinking about the subject. 
The way things were between them, Michiru would likely curse her existence until the day she 
died.</p><p>In that instant she heard someone yawn from behind her. Makoto was back up on 
her feet, fully healed, and stretching out her limbs. “Rrg...Wow, that’s a lot better! 
Thanks a lot you guys! I really needed that.”</p><p>“It was no problem. I’m just glad that 
you’re feeling better.” Ami smiled, but she hadn’t broken the spell yet. The remaining 
portion of her power went into Haruka and Michiru’s healing efforts, and soon the blonde 
woman was healed as well.</p><p>“Ahh...there we go!” Haruka stood up and jumped on the spot 
a few times to emphasize how light her body now felt. “Awesome work you two. You know, you 
guys really make a great team!”</p><p>“Still a flatterer,” Rei muttered. The comment made 
Haruka laugh.</p><p>“By the way, Rei, I guess you didn’t go full out against Minako after 
all seeing that you have this much energy.”</p><p>Rei caught the implication, but with 
Michiru in the area she didn’t had any inclination for share-and-tell.</p><p>“You’re wrong. 
We both fought hard. I just have a different fighting style, that’s all. Unlike you, I don’t 
blast every shred of my energy impulsively.” She smirked.</p><p>“… Hahaha...Ouch. Well, I 
couldn’t help it this time,” Haruka turned her head away and crossed her arms with a 
thoughtful expression. “There was a few times where I could’ve been crushed under some 
rumble if I didn’t react... like Makoto.” She saw Makoto’s head shoot up. “Apparently Ami 
outwitted her and sprung this amazing trap. I mean, it’s really no wonder why she was all 
black and blue.”</p><p>“Hey, you promised you wouldn’t tell!” Jupiter protested at the 
grinning blonde.</p><p>“What? But it’s not like it was a big secret.” <i>Actually, it was 
kind of obvious.</i></p><p>“But still!”</p><p>The two continued to bicker with one another 
while Rei finished healing up Michiru. She seemed to uphold her silence even as the last cut 
was healed without any signs of scarring. Rei had expected as much, but she said nothing of 
the cold shoulder treatment; instead the Martian concentrated on reeling in her powers, only 
managing to do so with a few grimaces. While spending time fixing up the others she wasted 
time to heal herself. The open cuts and scrapes badly stung as they were exposed to the air, 
and her muscles had become stiff and cramped from the lack of proper attention. However, 
there was one thing that irritated her more.</p><p>Rei peeled the dried blood over her 
closed eye and wrinkled her nose. For the first time in a long while she 
grumbled,</p><p><i>It stinks…</i> She couldn’t understand how she could ever lust for such 
stuff, even with her condition in mind.</p><p><b>Tap.</b></p><p>Rei violently flinched and 
whirled around when someone touched her shoulder from behind.</p><p>“Oh! I’m sorry. I didn’t 
mean to startle you,” Ami apologized. “But… I must insist that you sit still while I do 
this, all right? I will not tolerate any resistance this time. You need to be healed or your 
injuries may leave you with permanent disabilities.”</p><p>She had half-expected Rei to 
shrug her off as she always did, but to her surprise Rei yielded without a 
fight.</p><p>“…All right.”</p><p>Ami blinked back, dumb struck at what she had just heard. 
In all of her years knowing the other woman, Rei always, without fail, was strongly opposed 
to receiving help. Her friend was a strange individual indeed; although she would offer help 
herself, she was reluctant to receive it.</p><p>“All right, I’m starting.” Mercury informed 
her as she released a portion of her power and enveloped her patient</p><p>By now Uranus had 
stopped arguing with the pouting Makoto and eyed her former partner in crime at a 
distance.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p><i>Huh...That’s weird. Rei is actually sitting quietly for once? 
When we were kids it’d take all of us to drag her to a doctor or to one of the adults if she 
ever got hurt. Ahh...the good old days... She would always be kicking, and screaming death 
threats. It was actually kind of cute, but kinda surprising because she’s usually so 
reserved. </i>The sight brought a smile to Haruka’s face. <i>She looks so 
peaceful…</i></p><p><i>...Does this mean...that you’ve already told her, 
Rei?</i></p><p><u>(Medical Ward, Minako)</u></p><p>Minako had just finished helping Artemis 
tuck Setsuna into one of the nearby beds while, behind them, Luna and Usagi were busying 
themselves with Hotaru. As a result of Minako’s efforts, Luna was able to perform a good 
chunk of the treatment during the walk back. Hotaru was already looking better, but it would 
still be some effort yet before they could truly relax.</p><p>For the longest time Usagi’s 
gaze remained transfixed on her sister, never realizing that she had a small audience whose 
gazes were, in turn, fixed on her. Minako eyed her, and was unconsciously analyzing her 
mannerisms: How her hands remained stiff in her lap, how they shook ever so slightly, how 
her breathing had became shallow, and how her eyes would dart between the closing wound and 
Hotaru’s face. The expression on her face, she must have really thought that her sister was 
on her deathbed. It was stirring up some unpleasant memories for the 
Venusian.</p><p><i>They’re sisters, aren’t they? Hotaru is all the family she has left. So, 
if she ever lost her...</i></p><p>Despite her earlier bouts of resentment and jealously that 
she harboured against the Moon Princess, Minako walked over and patted her right on the 
shoulder.</p><p>“Hey, she’ll be all right.” She watched Usagi nod almost mechanically. “I 
mean, Hotaru has been through a lot of stuff worse than this. She’s strong, and I’m sure 
that Luna is a great healer too. So, don’t you worry! After she’s all better, you’ll both 
probably look back on this someday and laugh.”</p><p>Looking at Minako’s beaming face, Usagi 
couldn’t help but smile as well. “...Perhaps. She is strong, isn’t 
she?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>“You know... I haven’t told anybody this, but when we were little, 
we made a promise that we’d always be there for each other no matter what. She said she’d 
always be there for me. And I...” Her hands slightly tensed in her lap. “...I did this to 
her...”</p><p>The words reminded Minako of her own guilt after finding out about what had 
happened on Venus. She knew what it was like to nearly kill someone that you 
loved.</p><p>“...But it wasn’t your fault. Sometimes, these things just happen.”</p><p>Usagi 
shook her head. “I should have been more careful.” <i>For some reason, she didn’t try to 
avoid my attack. She said that she couldn’t, so...did something go wrong?</i> “There was 
probably another way, but I... I was so wrapped up with myself that maybe I didn’t 
notice.”</p><p>Even Minako wasn’t sure what to say to that.</p><p>“That’s enough, 
Usagi.”</p><p>“Luna?”</p><p>She saw Usagi look at her with her teary, blue eyes. “The 
purpose of the exercise was to teach all of you that these things are very possible in war. 
The moment you step onto the battlefield, you risk losing everything and everyone that you 
hold dear. Even Lady Hotaru...as powerful as she is, is no exception to this. That... is 
what she was trying to teach you.”</p><p>Usagi’s eyes widened. “You mean she did all of that 
on purpose?”</p><p>“Knowing Hotaru, I wouldn’t put it past her. She’s not the type of person 
to do things half-heartedly.” Artemis added.</p><p><i>So then...</i></p><p>Without warning 
Usagi sudden stood up from the bedside seat, and turned around and clasped Minako’s 
hands.</p><p>“Minako.”</p><p>“Uhh...Y-Yes...?” She wasn’t sure what to make of the 
determination in the girl’s eyes.</p><p>“Thank you again for all of your help. I really did, 
appreciate it.”</p><p>“Oh! Sure, like I said, it was no problem at all. 
Ahahaha...”</p><p>She continued to watch in surprise as the Moon Princess cross the floor 
over to Setsuna’s bedside.</p><p><i>Is it just me, or does the air around her suddenly 
feel... different?</i></p><p>In Usagi’s mind, everything from her previous duel with Hotaru 
was flashing back through the various stages: How Hotaru coldly stared her down, how she 
pointed a blade at her. The images kept flowing forward, highlighting the few moments where 
they clashed, where they purposely tried to hurt one another, and where they had nearly 
succeeded. One by one the injuries added up until Usagi narrowly evaded re-living the 
accident that nearly stole her only family away from her.</p><p><i>I want you, to become the 
Queen, and I... let me become your shadow.”</i></p><p><i>You went that far just to tell me 
something like that? </i></p><p>Her blue eyes glanced at her sister’s unconscious form, and 
then back over to her guardian. Setsuna looked very weary, but on willpower alone she 
managed to maintain her focus on her surroundings-- in this case, Usagi. Her crimson eyes 
silently observed her charge expectantly as she patiently waited to hear what she would 
say.</p><p>“Setsuna…” Usagi felt the urge to fumble her hands nervously, but she beat it 
back down. A bad habit she mentally noted. “…We… I mean, Hotaru and I have come to an 
agreement.”</p><p>Behind the Moon Princess, Minako and Luna’s ears perked up. Even Artemis 
was intrigued.</p><p><i>They made an agreement? </i>Minako wondered. <i>But...I don’t 
remember </i><i>Hotaru mentioning anything about an agreement when we were studying 
together… In fact, now that I think about it, Hotaru doesn’t really talk about herself, does 
she? Did she and Usagi...have an argument?</i></p><p>“We have decided, for now, that I will 
be the one who will ascend the throne.”</p><p>“The throne?!” Everyone yelled.</p><p>“I see…” 
Setsuna muttered. But Usagi wasn’t fooled; there was little doubt in her mind that the woman 
had predicted this to happen.</p><p>“However…There is a request that I would like to 
make.”</p><p>“A request?”</p><p>“Mm. Everyone has been working very hard lately... and today 
we have all made considerable progress. Therefore, I would like to propose that we give our 
guests the evening off and to hold a ballroom dance. Just like the old times.”</p><p>Setsuna 
stared long and hard at the to-be ruler.</p><p><i>...I see. You would like to have one last 
night of being a normal princess.</i></p><p>“I understand. Permission is granted.” Setsuna 
finally said. “However, in my current condition and as Luna is occupied with monitoring Lady 
Hotaru, you will need to ask Artemis if he would be willing to take up the 
preparations.”</p><p>“I’ll do it. No need to ask.” He grinned. Artemis had already braced 
himself for the usual ‘thank you’ squeal and hug from the young woman, but to his amazement 
Usagi hadn’t budged from her spot. She looked at him with blue eyes swimming with emotion, 
but she made no movement to clarify what was going through her mind.</p><p>“What, I don’t 
get a hug?”</p><p>Usagi slowly stood up and purposefully walked across the room to where he 
stood. She waited before her long-time friend for awhile, thinking quietly, before she 
finally stepped forward and gave him a big hug. Once his strong arms gently embraced her 
back and steadied her, she broke down and cried.</p><p>“Shhhhh…shhhhhh…” He comforted 
her.</p><p><i>It must be hard… going through something like that. </i>Minako thought to 
herself. The sight almost made her want to cry herself. <i>Realizing that you’re going to 
become a ruler of a planet, that you’re going to rule over countless lives and have millions 
of people looking up to you for protection and guidance… </i></p><p>…<i>it’s hard. 
</i></p><p><i>I thought that would be hard enough… but, what does Usagi have? Her people are 
already…</i></p><p>“Minako, will you please inform the girls of our plans when you see 
them?” Luna quietly requested. Usagi’s sobs still hadn’t faltered in their strength in the 
background.</p><p>“Yes, of course. I was just about to head back anyway.”</p><p>“Thank 
you.”</p><p>“Mm.” She nodded.</p><p>The Venusian paused at the doorway and took one last 
look at Usagi before she left the room.</p><p>…<i>Will I be like 
that…</i></p><p>………………………………<i>.when it hits me too?</i></p><p><u>(Palace room, 
Rei)</u></p><p>“Whew.”</p><p>Rei plopped down onto her bed and sighed deeply into the 
sheets. It was a relief, much to her surprise, to be back in this sort of place. It smelled… 
nice. She inhaled deeply before she angled her head until she could see the fragment of blue 
sky beyond the solitary room window. For some reason, today, her stomach was filled with 
butterflies.</p><p><i>I feel... strange. </i></p><p>Calm and peaceful, the two words drifted 
to mind.</p><p>Rei pushed herself up to sit, never once losing sight of that patch of sky. 
Her current emotions perplexed her.</p><p><i>I never thought that I would ever feel this 
way. I never really noticed these things before…</i></p><p><i>The sky, the wind, and the 
silence… were always indicators of the conditions of battle to me. If there were dark 
clouds, there would be bad weather. If there was a foul smell in the wind, there was war. If 
there was silence… you were either dead or barely alive. </i></p><p><i>But, when I look at 
all these things now… I realize that they can be comfortable.</i></p><p><i>It’s kind of 
nice.</i></p><p>Rei never realized the goofy smile that crept onto her face. She was too 
caught up within her own little world that she barely noticed that someone was knocking on 
the door.</p><p><i><b>Click.</b></i><b><br></b><i><b>Creeeeeak.</b></i></p><p>“I’d be 
careful if I were you. If you sigh like that anymore you might get light 
headed.”</p><p>“Mina!”</p><p>The blonde leaned against the doorframe with her arms crossed. 
Her blue eyes twinkled, silently laughing at her friend’s unusually enthusiastic 
reaction.</p><p>“Who else would it be? Or were you expecting someone else?”</p><p>“Well… no. 
I, umm… so, how are Setsuna and Hotaru?”</p><p>Minako raised an eyebrow at the sudden change 
of subject. “They’re doing all right. Luna was tending to Hotaru when I left and Setsuna was 
just getting some rest.”</p><p>“Oh. I see…”</p><p>“Some… other things came up while I was 
there too. Apparently, Usagi is going to inherit the Moon Kingdom’s throne.”</p><p>Rei 
blinked back at her with an expression of mixed confusion and surprise. “…Really? 
But…”</p><p>“I know, I know, I thought about it too. But unfortunately... there’s really 
nothing we can do about it. We can’t bring her people back. No one has that kind of 
power.”</p><p>“It must be tough for her…”</p><p>The thoughtful expression on Rei’s face made 
the corners of Minako’s mouth twitch. A part of her felt sympathy for Usagi, as 
contradictory as it may be for a person to feel towards their rival, but another part of her 
felt...</p><p>“You know, Usagi and me aren’t really all that different.” The statement had 
perked Rei’s interest. “Not just in appearance. We both lost loved ones because of this 
silly war… and now we’re both slated to become rulers before our time. But… she doesn’t have 
anyone left to protect. All she has is an empty kingdom, a few friends, and her sister. But 
don’t get me wrong, it’s not a bad thing. It’s just...I have so much more than she does... 
And in a way, it’s making me feel guilty. Goddess, Rei... she was crying down there! She was 
really crying…”</p><p><i>I almost wanted to cry too.</i></p><p>“Minako...?”</p><p>“You 
know...she really likes you.”</p><p>“Minako, wait. Why are you telling me all of 
this?”</p><p>Minako couldn’t take it anymore. Before Rei knew what was happening, the blonde 
came straight at her. She instinctively tried to back away on the bed but Minako jumped on 
top of her and pinned her with the sheer leverage of her body, holding her wrists above her 
head. A full blown blush was on Rei’s face. She thought that she would have fainted in shock 
if it weren’t for the serious expression on the Venusian’s face.</p><p>Rei started to panic 
when Minako began to lean down.</p><p><i>Oh no. Oh no, no, no, no---!!</i></p><p>“M-Mina--” 
Her words were abruptly cut off by a searing kiss. Rei’s mind instantly went blank. By the 
time she remembered that she should be reciprocating, Minako suddenly pulled back and left 
her looking back in confusion.</p><p>“That.” She said, further confusing the Martian. “Do 
you remember when I told you that it was a Venusian custom? Well... I kinda 
lied.”</p><p>Rei’s heart skipped a beat. <i>...What?</i></p><p>“But when I said that was 
meant only for you... I meant it. I’m not going to pressure you Rei. I’m not going to tell 
you what to do. I can’t, because this is about how <i>you </i>feel. You aren’t just a 
soldier who follows order. You’re a person, just like the rest of us. You’re...my best 
friend...”</p><p>The word made her heart ache.</p><p><i>Even if it would make Usagi happy, I 
can’t just give Rei to her. Because… that isn’t how love works. It’s really up to 
Rei.</i></p><p>She couldn’t get the image of Rei pulling Usagi into her room that one late 
night.</p><p>“Umm...W-Well, you’re my best friend too.”</p><p>“...Yeah, I know.” Minako 
smiled back. <i>But...I want us to be more than friends. </i>Instead of elaborating, she got 
off of her and walked back over to the doorway. “Anyway, I was supposed to tell everyone 
that we’ve been given the evening off. Usagi is going to be hosting a dance tonight, so she 
would like everyone to come. You’ll be going, right?”</p><p>“A dance? Hmm... I’m actually 
not very good with those things. I think I’ll pass.”</p><p>“I’ll be there.” She saw Rei 
tense. “And Usagi will be there too.”</p><p>In the back of her mind, she knew what she was 
doing was wrong. But before she could stop herself, she thought:</p><p><i>...Hey, you 
know...</i></p><p>“I love you.”</p><p><i>What?! </i>The whisper was so quiet that Rei barely 
caught it.</p><p>“…Umm...Did you... just say something just now?”</p><p>“Hm? Oh! Oh my 
goddess, I need to go tell everyone else about the dance! It’s getting late. Will you just 
look at the sky? I’ll see you later, okay?”</p><p>“Mina--!”</p><p>“See you at the dance!” 
She winked and rushed out before Rei could say another word. She had left so fast that Rei 
had only taken one step towards the doorframe before she was gone. Her hand, which had been 
reaching out, limply fell back to her side.</p><p><i>She’s gone... But, what was she just 
saying?</i></p><p>The Martian was left with the difficult task of digesting all of the 
information that Minako hurriedly threw at her. It was all kind of 
overwhelming.</p><p><i>So...there was no custom? Then, when she kissed me back on Neptune... 
and all of those others times--!! </i>It was all starting to sink in, and it was making 
Rei’s stomach do flip-flops. <i>No way. There’s no way she could actually...</i></p><p>She 
closed her eyes for a second and pondered to herself for a moment. When she opened them 
again, there was determined expression in her dark eyes.</p><p>“So...there’s going to be a 
dance tonight, huh?”</p><p><u>(Later that afternoon)</u></p><p>Sometime later the room had 
been transformed into a state of complete disarray; the drawers were wide thrown wide-open, 
garments were messily hanging over their sides, and the floor was littered with a 
combination of clothing, armor, and various trinkets of sorts. It looked as though the place 
had been hit by a tornado; a tornado named Rei.</p><p>Rei was sitting in the center of the 
room with a frown upon her lips. The woman’s brows were furrowed in deep concentration as 
she sat crossed legged atop a mountain of garments. It was taking every bit of her will 
power not to drum her fingers on her lap with impatience.</p><p>“A dance.” She repeated to 
herself for the umpteenth time within the last few hours. “Why a DANCE of all things! 
Argh!”</p><p>Rei crossed her arms and leaned back against the bed, taking this moment to 
stare up at the ceiling.</p><p><i>Not to mention that I can’t dance at all…</i> She groaned. 
<i>This is going to be embarrassing! </i><i>But…Mina said that she was going to be there. 
Everyone’s going to be there.</i></p><p><i>I know what I want to say, but...</i></p><p>“The 
question is... what should I wear?”</p><p>With a sigh, the Martian pushed herself up for a 
better look of the place. She placed her hands on her hips, and scanned the piles of mess 
with a glare that was especially reserved for disobedient soldiers. To her, this was a 
challenge like none other. Every second she wasted staring at the garments was another 
second of damage her already bruised pride.</p><p><i>I could always show up 
in...</i></p><p>She looked to her default choice and eyed the scattered pieces of armor. But 
somehow, the suit didn’t fit in with the image of luxurious ball setting. That and the 
prospect of being teased mercilessly didn’t quite appeal to her.</p><p><i>On second thought, 
maybe not. </i></p><p>Rei stumbled over to the closet on the other side of the room and 
nearly tripped several times in the process. It was a miracle that she reached the door 
unharmed, but she took her victories in stride. As she opened the door and began to ruffle 
through the clothes inside, a string of curses continued to form within her mind: Her main 
problem was that she hadn’t done this in awhile.</p><p><i>This is ridiculous, a dance of all 
things! Why, the last time that I’ve been to one was... was...</i></p><p>Rei stopped in her 
search, and lowered the shirt in her hands. She supposed it should have been a happy memory, 
but now it only brought her pain.</p><p><i>Dancing and all that... The only times that I 
ever got to do something like that was when we all met up every year. It was a common thing 
to do at the parties... but I can’t say that I was very good at it. The only ones who could 
actually dance were Ami and Michiru. They were usually the first ones out on the dance 
floor. While they were out there having fun, the rest of us just watched from the sidelines. 
Well, that was until Michiru or Ami coaxed one of us out onto the floor with 
them.</i></p><p><i>I’ve always hated dancing, so… I was usually the last one left on the 
sidelines. Actually, to be honest, I never learned how to do it...so... I never wanted to 
try. I thought I’d look stupid.</i></p><p><i>Lady Neptune, Michiru’s mother, once tried to 
teach me though. </i></p><p><b>. . . </b></p><p>“<i>Would you like to give it a try?” 
</i></p><p><i>The familiar, kind voice drew the young heir of Mars’s attention up to the 
gentle face that addressed her. </i></p><p>“<i>You mean dancing?” Briefly the girl’s eyes 
darted towards the dance floor. All of the adults were out there enjoying themselves. 
Whether it be dancing or drinking together, there were smiles wherever she looked. But 
happiness wasn’t solely monopolized by the grown-ups. A short distance ahead of her the 
other heirs were experimenting with the unfamiliar rhythms and steps. Although Haruka and 
Makoto were inexperienced dangers, they were still enjoying themselves. Everyone seemed to 
be having a good time except her.</i></p><p>“<i>I can’t dance,” She finally mumbled. 
</i></p><p>“<i>But it doesn’t mean that you can’t learn.”</i></p><p>“<i>No!” It had come out 
more forcefully than she had intended it to. “I-I mean, it’s just... I know I can’t, okay? I 
don’t like it anyway.” </i></p><p><i>The Goddess smiled. “That’s really too 
bad.”</i></p><p>“<i>Huh?”</i></p><p>“<i>I was really hoping to dance, but... it’s not as 
enjoyable without a partner. And it appears that everyone else is already taken.” She then 
offered out her hand to the young girl. “I know that you don’t enjoy doing it, but... do you 
think you can do me this one favour? Would you do me the honour and be my dance 
partner?”</i></p><p><i>Against Rei’s better judgement, she reached out and clasped that 
hand. She allowed herself to be guided out onto the dance floor, into the lights and away 
from the darkened sidelines. Yet as the twinge of loneliness shrunk inside her tiny body, 
the awkwardness exponentially grew. Some turned their eyes in her direction, staring at her 
with curious expressions. Even her mentor, the God of War took mild interest in his heir’s 
unusual behaviour. </i></p><p><i>Once Neptune found them a place on the floor, she began to 
explain the basic hand positions for common dances. Following that there was a period of 
awkwardness as Rei fumbled with the new information, but in almost no time at all they were 
practicing for real.</i></p><p>“<i>So...</i><i>What do you think of it so far?” Neptune 
asked her. </i></p><p>“<i>Well, to be honest...</i><i>I still don’t really see what’s so 
great about it.”</i></p><p><i>The comment brought a smile to Neptune’s face. She noticed 
that the child’s eyes were fixated on the couples on the dance floor. </i></p><p>“<i>They 
are with someone important to them.”</i></p><p>“<i>What?”</i></p><p>“<i>Dancing can be very 
enjoyable when one dances with someone precious to them. To stare into the eyes of the one 
you love, together swaying to the music... There is an inexplicable connection that binds 
both partners together in that single moment.”</i></p><p>“<i>Then... why aren’t you dancing 
with them? Why aren’t you dancing with your special person instead of me?” She asked her 
suspiciously.</i></p><p><i>The Goddess continued to smile yet, to the Martian’s eyes, Rei 
wondered if she had really imagined that flicker of sadness behind 
it.</i></p><p>“<i>That’s... for another day, I think.”</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>“<i>You are still 
very young, so there is no need to rush. But </i><i>I believe… that someday, when you have 
found that special person you will understand what I am talking about. There are very few 
joys that are greater in life.”</i></p><p>“<i>Really...? I don’t know about that. Ares seems 
pretty happy with just fighting.”</i></p><p>“<i>He is simply being stubborn.” The woman 
giggled. </i></p><p>“<i>?”</i></p><p>“<i>Listen, Rei… during your lifetime you may never 
encounter the curse of being a God. If you are fortunate, you may be spared of the cruel 
life that comes with our kind.”</i></p><p>“<i>What do you mean? What’s so bad about being a 
God?”</i></p><p>“<i>Your time is not frozen.” She paused for a moment and placed both hands 
on the shorter girl’s shoulders. “Finding one’s love may give a person great joy. However, 
if one is a God and the other is not, there is also no greater pain than to watch the one 
you love grow old and die.”</i></p><p>“<i>But, </i><i>because I’m still human…” Rei’s gaze 
fell to the floor.</i></p><p>“<i>Trust me, young one. </i><i>You are fine the way you 
are.”</i></p><p>“<i>Rei! Whatcha doing over there?! We’re going to go outside and play! Come 
on!” Haruka shouted across the room.</i></p><p>“<i>They are calling you.” Neptune released 
the heir of Mars and stepped back. Hesitantly the girl glanced between the two parties, 
wondering if this was really all right.</i></p><p>“<i>Go on.” The ruler urged. As she 
watched the child sped off towards her group of friends, Neptune whispered under her 
breath,</i></p><p>“<i>...I believe in you…”</i></p><p><b>. . . </b></p><p>“<i>...</i><i>I 
believe in you…”</i></p><p>Rei’s head shot up when she thought she felt a cold chill. She 
glanced around the room with a puzzled expression, but there was no one there. Breathing a 
little heavily, she allowed her gaze to linger a few seconds longer.</p><p><i>That’s 
strange...for a second there, I thought...</i></p><p>“No, get a hold of yourself. You can’t 
let yourself be distracted now! Time’s running out.” After another minute of shuffling 
through the assorted pile she threw her arms up in exasperation. “It’s no use! I just don’t 
have anything suitable! Most of this stuff is training wear...”</p><p>Rei stared at the bare 
clothes racks and found the situation growing hopeless by the second. The sun was beginning 
to set outside, indicating that the party may begin soon.</p><p>“Ahh… Well, I guess I have 
no choice. I’ll just have to throw something on and hope for the best. Anything would be 
better than going in <i>that</i>,” she eyed the pieces of armor on the floor. For some 
reason, the sight of it was really getting on her nerves.</p><p>Without thinking Rei walked 
over to the crimson, metallic pieces, picked them up and dumped them within the closet. 
After she had finished the deed, she heard someone knock at the door.</p><p><i><b>Rap. 
Rap.</b></i></p><p>“Rei?! It’s Haruka! We were just going down to the ballroom but I wanted 
to check up on you first. Are you ready yet?”</p><p>“Haruka?” She ran over to the door. 
“Hey, what are you wearing right now?”</p><p>“?” There was a silence from the other side of 
the door. “Just… stuff.”</p><p>“Is it a dress?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Haruka…”</p><p>“Okay! 
Okay!” Rei backed up just as the wind ruler barged in and slammed the door shut behind her. 
“Yes. It’s. A. Dress! Do you have a problem with that?!”</p><p>Rei nearly snorted. She had 
never seen her friend in such garments before. It was a one piece, golden dress that reached 
down to the floor. The top of it revealed quite a bit of Haruka’s shoulders, while down at 
her legs there seemed to be a small, forced rip that showed a peek of the woman’s ankles on 
either side. If that wasn’t bad enough, the blonde wore a thin, partially transparent scarf 
around her neck. It was pushing Haruka’s childhood friend to her limits; Rei feared that she 
was going to burst if she didn’t laugh soon.</p><p>“Don’t laugh!”</p><p>“I-I’m not. 
...Really!” She allowed herself to snicker.</p><p>“Humph. I’d wear a tux, but Michiru didn’t 
have any on her. Or that what’s she says anyway. Now that I think about it though, she 
probably just wanted to dress me up! Damn her!” The blonde frowned and punched the air. 
“Anyway... What about you? You aren’t going in that are you?”</p><p>“No. Of course not,” Rei 
lied. Although it actually had been on her plan of possible outfits, it wasn’t anymore. 
“Actually, to be honest...I don’t know what to wear. I didn’t expect anything like this to 
happen, I mean being in a war and all... The only clothes I’ve got on me are my training 
wear and, well... my armor, but I don’t think that counts.”</p><p>“Hmm… I know the feeling. 
I was having the exact same problem, but now, because of that, I’m stuck in THIS! I swear! I 
love her to death, but Michiru’s crazy! She’s almost always prepared for EVERYTHING.” Haruka 
took enough time to pause in her rant when a light-bulb went off in her head. “Hey, you 
know… I’m sure she could lend you something too. She has a ton of clothes like you wouldn’t 
believe.”</p><p>“Ask Michiru? I think I’ll pass.” The Martian crossed her arms 
stubbornly.</p><p>“Okay, then I’ll ask for you.”</p><p>Rei went red in the face. 
“No!”</p><p>“It’ll be fiiiiiiiine. I’ll lay on the charm and she won’t be able to refuse!” 
She winked. “But if she has a tux... first dibs!”</p><p>“H-Haruka, wait a minute. Really 
it’s all ri--”</p><p><i><b>Slam!</b></i></p><p>But it was too late; Haruka was already out 
the door.</p><p>To Rei’s surprise, not more than ten minutes later the woman returned… 
alive. The shorthaired blonde was slightly out of breath, but the Martian let it pass; she 
didn’t want to know what sort of charm the flatterer attempted to pull. Putting the issue 
aside, the package in Haruka’s hand piqued her curiosity much more.</p><p>“Here. Just like I 
said. No problem... whatsoever, wheeeew.” She handed the package over to her bewildered 
friend.</p><p><i>Can I even trust this thing? </i>Rei was almost afraid of opening 
it.</p><p>“Anyway, put it on and then come on down! I’m sure most of us are already down 
there. Catcha later!”</p><p>The door shut behind the blonde tornado as she left, thus again 
leaving Rei alone once again. She sighed quietly to herself before she began to fiddle 
around with opening the box.</p><p><i>Well, I guess that’s that. There’s really no point in 
putting it off-- it’s not like the contents will 
change.</i></p><p><i><b>Whup…</b></i></p><p>The box lid came flying off. She wasn’t sure 
what to make of it.</p><p>“I have to wear this?”</p><p><u>(Ballroom)</u></p><p>Makoto, Ami, 
Michiru and Haruka were the first guests to enjoy the lavishly prepared ballroom. While Ami 
and Makoto chatted together on the dance floor, Michiru and Haruka remained by the food 
table where Uranus insisted on stuffing herself.</p><p>“Did you give her the 
package?”</p><p>Michiru resisted the urge to fall back onto her old habits and scold her 
partner for her lack of manners. The past reaction was continually being fuelled now that a 
certain someone had found the cookie plate.</p><p>“Of cousff--”</p><p>“Haruka, please 
swallow first and then speak. It is difficult to hear you 
otherwise.”</p><p><i><b>Gulp.</b></i></p><p>“Sorry about that. I was just so hungry that I 
forgot myself.” She apologized. “Not to mention that this food is so good too! Ahhh...!!! I 
could stay here all night!”</p><p>“…”</p><p><i><b>Stare.</b></i></p><p>“…Uhh… yes, I did 
give it to her.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>“Why are you so curious anyway? You didn’t tamper with 
it or something did you?”</p><p>“Of course not! Honestly Haruka, what do you--”</p><p>“Oh. 
Speaking of the devil...”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>From the near side of the room, Rei approached 
the two gossiping women with an air of annoyance. The outfit she wore consisted of a black, 
spaghetti strapped shirt and a black skirt; the shirt showed off a good portion of the 
delicate, pale skin about her neck and shoulders. Whereas the skirt, though it reached down 
to the floor, naturally parted open on one side and showed off the woman’s long, slender 
legs. All of Rei’s natural curves, much like Haruka’s, that were normally hidden by the 
armor were now out in plain sight. The spectacle nearly made Haruka’s eyes bulge in 
disbelief.</p><p>“Ow! My eyes!” She feigned dramatically. “So. Much. Skin! What have you 
done to the real Rei?!”</p><p>“I could say the same for you.” Rei retorted. She then looked 
to Michiru, who currently seemed to be critiquing her sense of fashion for the other 
woman.</p><p>“I suppose it will do.” She finally concluded.</p><p>“Well, I wasn’t sure what 
to think when I first saw it.” <i>Or whether to trust it or not, but she doesn’t have to 
know that. </i>“But… T-Thanks, Michiru.”</p><p>“Think nothing of it. I was… merely paying 
off a debt.”</p><p>Between the pair Haruka had resumed assaulting the sweets plates, 
blissfully oblivious to the mild tension between her friends.</p><p>“Hey, Rei! Looking 
good!” Makoto and Ami now made their way over to the trio.</p><p>“Yes, it really suits you.” 
Ami agreed.</p><p>“Umm… thanks.”</p><p>“She should wear stuff… like thad mour 
offen.”</p><p>“Haruka…”</p><p>“Sorry.”</p><p>“By the way, has anyone seen Minako?” Rei 
questioned. “She said she was going to come, but it doesn’t look like she’s 
here.”</p><p>“Oh, she didn’t come down with you?” Haruka asked. “Yeah, ‘cause we knocked on 
her door earlier and she said she’d be down asap.”</p><p>“She did?” <i>Then </i><i>what’s 
taking her so long? </i>It must have been written all over her face because Haruka then 
said,</p><p>“Aww… don’t worry, she’ll come down before you know it. In the meantime, why 
don’t we get this party started? It’s a bit dull, don’t you think?”</p><p>Michiru returned 
the sparkling grin with a suspicious look.</p><p>“What are you up to?”</p><p>“You’ll see!” 
The blonde laughed. “Hey, Artemis! Could we borrow a few things?”</p><p><u>(Another hour 
later, Usagi)</u></p><p>The to-be ruler slowly made her way down a series of corridors 
towards the ballroom, outfitted with her favorite dress and usual hairstyle. Though she was 
sure that the dance, the event that she was supposed to be hosting this instant, had already 
started, her thoughts were not preoccupied with the excuses and explanations for her 
tardiness that she would be expected to dish out to her guests. Instead the woman fretted 
with questions of personal matters. Her appearance, did she look beautiful? She fiddled with 
a free strand of her hair. Her dress-- it didn’t make her look fat, did it? Everything that 
could go wrong, no matter how unlikely crossed her mind. The stress was beginning to make 
her feel awfully sick.</p><p><i>Should I ask her? But what if she says ‘no’? </i>She 
pondered. Rei didn’t seem like the type to attend those kinds of social 
gatherings.</p><p><i>Will she even go?</i></p><p>As Usagi neared her destination the music 
in the background grew in intensity. However, it they style wasn’t what she had been 
expecting to hear. The beat was unfamiliar and different, but it was refreshing somehow. The 
distinct music of the violin and the piano rang throughout the corridor 
now.</p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p>Usagi’s breath was caught in her throat upon reaching 
the lively area. To her amazement, the air was filled with golden spheres of light. They 
moved through the air with smooth, fluid movements; one in particular touched her bare arm, 
prompting her to flinch back as it passed right through her. Where it had touch, there was 
some strange but not unwelcome warmth lingering there.</p><p>A little calmer, Usagi then 
peered around the room. Within the mass of floating energy up ahead, Ami and Makoto were 
dancing with one another. To the side of the two women were Neptune and Uranus. To her 
delight the pair of Goddesses was the ones who were creating the beautiful melody. 
Unconsciously, she blushed upon seeing the perfect couple interacting so harmoniously; it 
wasn’t solely due to their perfect synching of instruments or their physical beauty that 
caused her heart race. What she admired, was their closeness. How they would share brief 
glances between the notes with deep affection, how sincere their smiles were to one another. 
What she envied, was their love. She was so distracted that she hardly noticed that it was 
Uranus’s aura that was multiplying the golden spheres of light.</p><p>Usagi’s mind was 
beckoned back to reality when she sensed another restless presence nearby. She turned her 
head to see a familiar figure standing along the wall directly across from 
her.</p><p><i>...Rei? </i></p><p>Usagi almost didn’t recognize the beautiful woman standing 
amongst the lights.</p><p>Rei’s outfit was a major factor, yet it was exactly that type of 
change that nearly brought Usagi to mistake her teammate for an entirely different 
individual altogether. She was simply so stunning that any stranger would have surely 
thought of her as Goddess descent. But upon closer inspection, the irritated expression that 
the Martian wore confirmed Usagi’s suspicions of who this familiar stranger was; only Rei 
had such an ability to hold a frown like that.</p><p>The blonde felt a lump starting to form 
in her throat. Rei was alone. She was naturally drawn to her and before she knew it, she was 
already crossing the floor.</p><p>Rei on the other hand hadn’t noticed the new presence 
nearing her location. Perhaps the music was counteracting against her acute sense of 
hearing, or Haruka’s power was causing interference in her detection ability, or perhaps the 
culprit was the Martian herself. A certain absence became the obsession of her 
attention.</p><p>Minako still hasn’t shown up.</p><p><i>Honestly, where is she? Minako said 
that she was going come but the dance has already started a long time ago. </i> <i>Could 
something have happened to her? </i>There was a thought. <i>Maybe I better go and check up 
on her...just to see if she’s okay.</i></p><p>Absent-mindedly Rei whirled around and nearly 
knocked Usagi over in the process.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>“!” Rei staggered back, thoroughly 
startled. But she relaxed her stance once she recognized the poor soul that she nearly 
flattened by her thoughtless actions. “Usagi?! I-I didn’t mean to… I didn’t see you! Are you 
all right? You aren’t hurt are you?”</p><p>“<i>You know...she really likes you.”</i>Minako’s 
words resounded in the Martian’s mind.</p><p>With curious observation, Rei steadily stared 
down at the timid individual before her. Now that she thought about it, the Moon Princess 
had been acting peculiarly lately. She had thought that Usagi was a lot like Minako, in the 
sense that they were both naturally out-going, but the blonde in front of her was definitely 
blushing and looking nervous about something. Could it really be because of her?</p><p>She 
hardly noticed that Usagi was saying something.</p><p>“No, it was my fault. Umm...Were you 
going somewhere?” She questioned in a soft voice. Her entire face was red now. “I-I didn’t 
mean to startle you like that. I should have paid more attention too.”</p><p>Rei felt a lump 
form in her throat.</p><p>“If-- If you aren’t busy… or mind, I mean, it would be really nice 
if, if you would…” Usagi broke eye contact briefly, before gathering the courage to 
ask,</p><p>“Will you… dance with me?”</p><p>“…Usagi...”</p><p>She was taken aback by Rei’s 
softened expression. Something was wrong. Unable to speak or move, Usagi felt her hands 
taken by the other woman and watched with baited breath as she stepped forward and leaned 
down. The music in the background hit a forte section, the volume continuing to rise even as 
Rei’s lips came to stop beside the blonde’s ear.</p><p>Her lips began to move.</p><p>The 
seconds passed by. One second… two… The invisible clock of time adamantly marched onwards, 
acting as both the observer and recorder, encasing this moment within the never-ending 
timeline.</p><p>…Twelve… thirteen… Tears began to blur Usagi’s vision. She blinks, and the 
tears are set free.</p><p>…Nineteen…twenty.</p><p>The Martian’s lips lastly whispered three 
syllables.</p><p>Rei then pulled away and left through the exit, leaving Usagi behind and 
stunned; she stood there, completely paralyzed.</p><p>Another tear fell.</p><p><u>(Minako’s 
room, Rei)</u></p><p><i><b>Knock, knock.</b></i></p><p>Minako’s room was dim, and was 
lighted only by the single desk-lamp on her desk. In her nightclothes, Minako angled her 
head from her desk and stared at the door. She hadn’t imagined the sound, had 
she?</p><p>“Who is 
it?”</p><p><i><b>Click.</b></i><b><br></b><i><b>Creeeeeak.</b></i></p><p>Her blue eyes 
widened a little when the unexpected visitor revealed herself.</p><p>“Hey.” Rei greeted. She 
bashfully entered the room, extremely self-conscious of her unusual appearance.</p><p>“…Rei? 
Is that really you? You look… great! I mean, wow. So, w-what are you doing here?” Minako 
turned around in her chair and stood up, spacing herself away from her desk. There was a 
hint of hesitation in her eyes.</p><p>“What do you mean, ‘what are you doing here’?” The 
Martian huffed. She crossed her arms over her chest in irritation and stared the Venusian 
straight in the eye. “You said you’d be at the dance. So why aren’t you?”</p><p>Rei eyed her 
nightwear, and had to blink. Minako was wearing a white, short-sleeved shirt and a pair of 
yellow pajama pants with a heart pattern on them.</p><p><i>Are 
those...hearts?</i></p><p>Minako didn’t seem to notice that she was being stared at. She 
seemed to be too preoccupied with her own thoughts.</p><p>“Oh...well, I was 
studying.”</p><p>“Studying?” Rei arched an eyebrow. “Are you really trying to tell me that 
you prefer studying over dancing? You seemed pretty worked up about it 
earlier.”</p><p>“Well, maybe I decided not to go after all! Besides... why aren’t you 
there?”</p><p>“Well, obviously I was worried because a certain someone didn’t show up like 
they said they would.”</p><p>“So you came to check up on me?” There was disappointment 
underlying her tone. “Thanks, but I’m fine. You can go back now.”</p><p>Rei narrowed her 
eyes. “I’m not going back.”</p><p>“What? But what about Usagi?”</p><p>“Usagi...?” Rei sighed 
in exasperation. There it was again. “What does this have to do with her? Why do you keep 
bringing her up?!”</p><p>“Well, you guys have been hanging out so much lately, so why 
wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“Goddess Minako! The way you’re talking, you almost make it sound like 
you’re jealous!”</p><p>There was a heavy silence between the women as the word seemed to 
hang in the air. Minako had gone pale, and Rei returned the stunned expression in 
disbelief.</p><p>“...Wait. You aren’t, are you?”</p><p>Minako turned away. She didn’t want 
Rei to see the pained expression on her face. “So what if I was?”</p><p>“But...why would you 
be jealous of Usagi? We only started hanging out more because you started avoiding me. 
Speaking of which, why <i>were </i>you avoiding me?”</p><p>Minako mumbled something but Rei 
didn’t quite catch it.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>She seemed to take a deep breath. “I said...it 
was because I thought that there was something going on between you two, okay?” She caught 
Rei’s ‘huh?’ expression and was starting to get angry again. “When I went to get you for 
Setsuna’s meeting, you two were practically in each other’s arms, not to mention later that 
night when you were seeing each other!”</p><p>“Wait, what night? Before what meeting? The 
one after you all arrived?” She noticed that the blonde had fallen silent. It suddenly 
dawned on her what Minako was referring to. “Are you talking about...?” She shook her head. 
“Goddess, Minako. Is that what you thought it was? I don’t even like Usagi! I mean, she’s 
nice, but she’s just a friend.”</p><p>Minako slowly turned around. 
“...Really?”</p><p>“...Yeah. To be honest, I had only met Usagi a few seconds before you 
did. I was trying to get up and she thought it would be bad for my wounds, so we 
accidentally...fell like that. And that’s when you came in. I don’t know why you thought we 
were like <i>that, </i>but it wasn’t like <i>that</i> at all.”</p><p>“But what about 
later...? Why was she at your door so late at night? And then you pulled her into your 
room!”</p><p>Rei tilted her head at the comment. “She had my medicine. And I wanted it 
back.” The answer seemed to catch Minako off guard.</p><p>“But why did she...?”</p><p>“Look, 
that doesn’t matter. What I want to know is... if it bothered you then why didn’t you come 
and talk to me about it? We’re friends, aren’t we?”</p><p>“...I did try. But if I recall, 
you ran away from me.”</p><p>This time, it was Rei’s turn to look surprised. She had nearly 
forgotten about that. <i>So that’s what she wanted to talk about...</i></p><p>“I admit that 
was my fault... I apologize. But that still doesn’t explain a few things. When you told me 
today that there was no Venusian custom about kissing friends... did you mean 
it?”</p><p>Minako walked over to the terrace and stopped in front of its closed doors. She 
touched the cool glass and carefully eyed Rei’s reflection.</p><p>“...Yeah. I like you...all 
right? I’ve liked you for awhile now...”</p><p>“If that’s true, then why didn’t you just 
tell me? Why did you go through the trouble of making up such an excuse? I really trusted 
you.”</p><p>It hurt to hear those words, but Minako should have known it would have come to 
this. The moment she told her the truth, Rei was going to hate her.</p><p>“I know it was 
wrong...but at the time, I didn’t know what else to do. If you’re angry with me, I 
completely understand.”</p><p>For awhile, Rei was silent. Minako took it that the Martian 
was indeed upset with her.</p><p>“If that’s all you wanted to talk about, then could you 
please leave? I think I’d like to be left alone for awhile...”</p><p>Minako was startled 
when she saw Rei’s reflection coming closer. She turned on the spot to ask what she was 
doing, but she quickly found herself face to face with the Martian.</p><p>“Rei...?” She felt 
the other woman gently clasp her hands. Why was there such a serious expression in her 
eyes?</p><p>“Mina.” The way she said her name made the blonde shudder. “There’s...something 
that I’ve been meaning to tell you for some time now.”</p><p><i>Oh no... Now she’s going to 
tell me that she hates me!</i></p><p>Rei gave her hands a light squeeze. “A lot of stuff has 
happened ever since we left Mars. There were a lot of hard times...and for awhile, I wasn’t 
sure whether to trust you or not. Like, on Neptune... you really surprised me. For awhile, I 
wasn’t sure what to do. And then, when you started avoiding me... it really hurt.” Minako 
tried to turn her head away, but Rei lifted one hand to her face and urged her not to look 
away. “But despite all of that, you became one of the closest friends that I ever had. 
Minako... Even though we’re friends, I...”</p><p><i>...What?</i></p><p>“I think I like 
you.”</p><p>Minako was stunned. There was no way she could have heard that, but her heart 
was already racing in her chest.</p><p>Rei was really blushing now.</p><p>“I don’t know if 
it’s l-love...but I know I do know that like you as more than a friend. You don’t think it’s 
weird, do you...?”</p><p>Minako brought her own hands up and placed them on Rei’s arms. “No, 
but...please don’t get mad at me, but I have to know. What about Usagi? You know that she 
likes you.”</p><p>A mixed expression washed over Rei’s face.</p><p>“I think she’ll be all 
right.”</p><p>“You mean you…?”</p><p><u>(Ballroom, Usagi)</u></p><p>Usagi wiped away the 
tears from her eyes, and a small smile found its way to her face. There was calm reflecting 
in her eyes as she peered up to the ceiling, eyeing a certain spot as though there were an 
invisible presence watching over her.</p><p>…<i>I understand…</i></p><p>“Usagi, are you 
feeling all right?” Makoto asked as she touched her shoulder. “You look a bit 
pale…”</p><p>“Oh. Perhaps I am still tired from today’s exercise. I haven’t gotten much 
sleep lately. But don’t worry, I’m fine… I’ll… be fine. If you would please excuse me, I 
would like to go and check up on Hotaru. Please continue to enjoy yourselves.”</p><p>She 
curtsied and then exited the room.</p><p><u>(Minako’s room, Rei)</u></p><p>They both looked 
into each other’s eyes, neither of them daring to look away. As Rei began to lean in, she 
thought her heart was about to burst from happiness. If this was a dream, then it felt too 
real.</p><p>Rei’s lips were a few inches away when she suddenly hesitated. Minako held her 
breath; had she changed her mind?</p><p>Rei shyly met her gaze. “Is this...all 
right?”</p><p>Slowly, a smile made its way to Minako’s face. She giggled and wrapped her 
arms around Rei’s neck, pulling the woman closer. “Mhmm...” She nodded.</p><p>This time, 
their lips met in a gentle kiss. It was warm and almost shy, not the same, frantic ones 
they’ve shared in the past. Minako thought she had died and gone to heaven; the tenderness 
that Rei was showing her went beyond anything she had ever imagined.</p><p>When the kiss 
finally came to an end, both of them found each other’s eye and saw that the other was 
blushing terribly. It had been their first, real kiss. They both broke down into giggles at 
the thought.</p><p>“It sure took us awhile, huh?” Minako asked.</p><p>“...Yeah.” Rei smiled. 
“...But, what do we do now?”</p><p>There was a thoughtful expression on Minako’s face. Why 
was she looking at her like that? Without a word, the Venusian stood up and grabbed the door 
handles of the terrace 
doors.</p><p>“Minako?”</p><p><i><b>Click—WooooOOOSSSH!</b></i></p><p>The moment the doors 
were opened, a gust of wind instantly blew into the room. Rei’s breath caught in her throat 
at the sight; despite her attire, Minako really did look like a Goddess. As she stood in the 
doorway, her long, golden hair waved in the wind and her backside was framed by a perfect 
starry night.</p><p>“C’mon.”</p><p>“?” Confused amethyst eyes peered up at the offered 
hand.</p><p>“Would you like to dance?” She smiled back. “Because of me, you’re missing out 
on the party.”</p><p>“But I—I can’t dance very well.” Rei mouthed.</p><p>“But if you don’t 
try, then you can’t get better, right?”</p><p>“<i>But it doesn’t mean that you can’t 
learn.”</i></p><p>Rei eyed the outstretched hand again. Finally, she reached out to take it 
and her partner smiled. The Martian was brought to her feet and then was slowly guided 
outside to the terrace. The transition was like day to night; the room had been considerably 
dimmer in comparison to the star filled night sky illuminating the terrace.</p><p>“I’m 
warning you, I don’t know a lot of steps. So I might be a little bit clumsy for 
awhile…”</p><p>“I don’t think it will be a problem.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Not for this type 
of dance anyway.”</p><p>Vaguely Rei could hear the soft music drifting up from the ballroom 
below. She was away from the curious stares, away from shadows, gone from the blaring music 
and the golden spheres of light. Instead, she was here with Minako under the starry sky. Her 
heart was here.</p><p>Minako stepped forward and embraced her partner, encircling her arms 
around the hesitant woman. For a split-second, Rei was unsure of what to do. What was Minako 
doing? She remained still until Minako began to guide her body into a series of slow steps, 
each never moving far from where they stood now.</p><p><i>Oh, I see now…</i></p><p>Minako 
leaned her head on Rei’s left shoulder and smiled as she felt a pair of arms wrap around her 
slim body, holding her close and tight. They stayed like that-- both gently swaying to the 
set rhythm, revelling in the warmth that had blossomed between them.</p><p>Rei blushed hard 
when Minako released a soft, content sigh; her breath had brushed against the exposed part 
of the woman’s shoulder, bringing Rei to inwardly shudder.</p><p>“<i>Dancing can be very 
enjoyable when one dances with someone precious to them. To stare into the eyes of the one 
you love, together swaying to the music... There is an inexplicable connection that binds 
both partners together in that single moment.”</i></p><p><i>So...this is what she 
meant.</i></p><p><u>(Medical Ward, Hotaru)</u></p><p>Hotaru silently eyed her sister, who 
was quietly crying on her lap. The blanket that covered her was quickly becoming wet with 
tears, but she didn’t protest. Instead Hotaru rested a free hand on Usagi’s head, doing her 
best to comfort the girl in the way she knew best; she allowed her to cry, always ready to 
lend an ear if her sister should ever wish to speak.</p><p>The stars in the night sky 
outside soon caught her eye and Hotaru turned her gaze towards the window, feeling nostalgic 
at the awe-inspiring sight.</p><p>…<i>Perhaps…</i></p><p>…<i>if the two of you had met 
earlier, there may have been a chance…</i></p><p><i>But, Usagi, this does not mean that you 
should give up on love… Keep on living life to the fullest like you always have. And, 
perhaps, someday you may fall for someone who can truly love you back. Until then…I will 
stay with you as long as I can.</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>Hotaru paused when the sobbing stopped. 
A small smile lit her face upon realizing that Usagi had finally cried herself to sleep. As 
usual, the blonde hadn’t thought about the possible consequences.</p><p>There was a moment 
of shuffling until Hotaru allowed her sibling to share her bed with her. Usagi mumbled 
something incoherent and reached out for the nearest warm source, thus snuggling up to the 
dark-haired woman. Hotaru sighed a little, and returned the embrace. It was like the old 
days when they were close. The memory brought another smile to her lips.</p><p><i>Good night 
to you… </i></p><p>…<i>my dear one…</i></p>
