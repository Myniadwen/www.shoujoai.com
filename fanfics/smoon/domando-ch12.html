<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 12 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>The song is called &#39;Open Arms&#39; and is sung by Journey. I don&#39;t own the 
song nor Sailor Moon.

The sun poured in thru the living room window. Artemis blinked sleepily 
as the heat from the morning sun began to lightly burnhis face. He 
yanwed, streched and shook his body. He then padded his way to Makoto&#39;s 
bedroom. Minako had moved in just the weekend before and the place 
really hadn&#39;t changed much. Only things that were different were some of 
Minako&#39;s things were mixed in with Makoto around the loft, and Makoto 
wasn&#39;t there.

Neither was Yung Hu.

Artemis stopped in the hall way, shook his head as the tears began to 
form and continued his way to Minako and Makoto&#39;s bedroom. He pushed the 
door open with his nose and peeked in. Minako looked so small in the 
large bed.

Artemis pushed the door open more, walked over to the bed and jumped up 
into it. He layed next to her and began to purr as he rubbed his cheek 
agaisnt her&#39;s. In moments, Minako&#39;s eyes fluttered open.

&quot;Morning, Arty,&quot; Minako yawned. &quot;What time is is?&quot;

Artemis looked over at the digital clock. &quot;Just after nine.&quot;

Minako nodded, rolled over onto her side and laid there for a moment 
before climbing out of the bed and walking into the bathroom.

Minako, after showering and breakfast, headed to Rei&#39;s temple. Spring 
was nearly over and the days were begining to get warmer and warmer. 
Minako&#39;s prom was in two weeks, and the thought depressed her. Even if 
Makoto was normal before then,would she still want to go with Minako to 
prom? Minako shook her head as she climbed the last stair and waved to 
Rei who was, as usual, busy with chores.

&quot;Hey Rei-chan,&quot; Minako greeted.

&quot;Konnichi wa,&quot; Rei answered back. &quot;Whats up?&quot;

&quot;Ah, nothing much. I was coming over to make sure that I had guard duty 
tonight.&quot;

Rei nodded. &quot;Yup, you do. Starts after sundown.&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Who&#39;s there now?&quot;

Rei stopped, trying to remember. &quot;Mamoru-san, I think.&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;When did he start helping?&quot;

&quot;When Usagi asked him to. If something happens with her family and she 
can&#39;t make it, he takes over for her if he can,&quot; Rei said.

Minako nodded, her dark mood becoming darker. &quot;I miss Mako-chan,&quot; Minako 
said out loud, mostly to herself.

Rei couldn&#39;t help but to feel sorry for Minako. &quot;I know.&quot;

After a moment&#39;s silence, Minako continued, &quot;And I hate Ami.&quot;

Rei sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t blame you.&quot; Rei looked up at Minako. &quot;But you can&#39;t 
let your personal feelings get in the way of our mission right now.&quot;

Minako sighed and nodded. &quot;Hai. I know.&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;But I 
want one good chance at her.&quot;

Rei&#39;s face paled. Minako spoke of Ami as if Minako was pushed any 
further by the genius girl, Mianko would kill her. It was so odd to see 
the spark in Minako&#39;s eyes fade to only be replaced by hatred.

Minako&#39;s sighing brought Rei out of her thoughts. &quot;Well, Rei-chan. I&#39;m 
going to go. I need to get some things together for tonight. Ja.&quot;

Rei waved. &quot;Ja.&quot;

The day droned on. Minako went home to gather a napsack, a book, cd 
player and cds, and a small light for her guarding shift. She packed 
everything into a duffle bag, except for the nap sack because it was too 
big. As the sun began to set, Mianko left the apartment, Artemis at her 
heels. He had decided to go with her so she wouldn&#39;t feel too lonely.

As Minako pulled up to the warehouse in her car, she saw Mamoru sanding 
next to a wall with a hole in it the size of a buick. It was the only 
way in our out of the grounds that surrounded the warehouse, except for 
flying up and out.

Minako parked her car and pulled her things out from the back seat. 
Artemis jumped out of the car after her and ran ahead to the other side 
of the street.

&quot;Hey, Mamoru-kun,&quot; the white feline greeted. &quot;How are you?&quot;

&quot;Tired,&quot; Mamoru said, covering a yawn.

&quot;I bet. Well you can go home now,&quot; Artemis said, trying to sound 
helpful.

&quot;Thanks. But I need to talk to Minako.&quot; Minako appeared at Artemis&#39;s 
side at the moment, hearing Mamoru&#39;s comment.

&quot;Talk to me about what,&quot; she asked curiously.

&quot;Dragon girl is acting weird. She isn&#39;t being her usual loud, defiant 
self.&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;What is she doing?&quot;

&quot;Nothing. That&#39;s what&#39;s weird. She sits crouched in the far corner. 
Watching. I think she&#39;s up to something.&quot;

Mianko sighed. &quot;Makoto was never able to stay long in one place. She&#39;s 
been in there nearly a month with out coming out. It&#39;s probably getting 
to her.&quot;

&quot;I thought I&#39;d warn you,&quot; Mamoru said.

&quot;Thanks. Ja ne, Mamo-chan.&quot; Minako winked at him and disappeared inside 
the hole. Artemis sighed and followed. Mamoru watched her creep into the 
building before he himself turned, walked to his motorcycle and left.

Minako walked to the back of the warehouse, moved aside a piece of loose 
boarding and entered the old building. It was much colder in here than 
outside. Drafts came in thru cracks of the warehouse, seemingly 
amplifying the coldbreeze from outside into a cold wind inside. 
Shivering, Minako, along with Artemis, made her way to the room that 
held Makoto.

As Minako stepped into the room that held Makoto, Minako could tell 
there was something different. Makoto sat in the far corner, the darkest 
corner, her tail the only thing that was visiable from the shadow.

Minako stepped further into the room, keeping her eyes on Makoto. Minako 
knew Makoto couldn&#39;t reach her due to the chains that imprisoned her, 
but Makoto could breath fire just like any other traditional dragon.

&quot;Hey, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said, trying to sound cheery. Makoto flashed 
her eyes a bright red and growled deeply within her throat for her 
greeting. Minako sighed and began to set up for her night at the 
warehouse...

Hours passed and Makoto was behaving herself for the most part. At one 
point she tried to remove a pesky lump that was postioned right above 
Artemis&#39;s shoulders; his head.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe she tried to do that,&quot; he cried out angerily.

Minako sighed and flipped thru her book. &quot;Serves you right. You knew she 
wouldn&#39;t apprieciate you trying to play withher tail.&quot;

Makoto finally fell asleep around one in the morning. Minako was about 
to join her when a beeping from her wrist woke her up.

&quot;Venus here,&quot; Minako said. &quot;Go.&quot;

&quot;Youma attack,&quot; came Mars&#39;s voice. &quot;In the park. Near the running trail 
around the lake.&quot;

&quot;Got it.&quot; Minako snapped her watch shut and transformed. By this time 
Makoto had re awakened and was staring at Minako, growling and snarling 
at her for waking her up. &quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Minako said as she left the 
room, Artemis staying behind.

As Venus arrived at the scene, she noticed Mercury was just arriving as 
well.

&quot;Venus!&quot; Mercury called out.

Venus glared. &quot;Blow off,&quot; she muttered to Mercury as she passed her to 
go stand next to Mars and Sailor Moon. The two were crouched on the 
ground, holding their wounds; small scratches and cuts along their arms 
and torso.

Venus sized the monster up as she heard Mercury retrieve her 
mini-computer and began to analyze it for weakness. Its body looked to 
be made out of stone. It was largly built and stocky. It looked like it 
could take a hit and keep going.

After five minutes, Mercury came up with nothing.

&quot;Sorry guys, but I can&#39;t come up with anything,&quot; Mercury said.

&quot;So basicly we gotta wing it,&quot; Venus asked. &quot;Fine with me.&quot; Venus 
charged the monster, called out her chain attack and wrapped it arround 
it&#39;s throat. She landed behind it, and tugged as hard as she could. To 
her surprise, it fell backwards.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Venus said. &quot;That wasn&#39;t so ba-AAAAHHH!&quot; The monster ahd stood 
back up and jerked its body forward, causing Venus to go flying into a 
lamp post. Her body hit it so hard, the lamp post bent beneath the 
force.

Venus slumped to the ground, her entire body aching from the impact.

&quot;Venus are you alright?&quot;

Venus opened her eyes and glared at the water senshi. &quot;Get. The. Fuck. 
Away. From. Me. Now.&quot; Mercury blinked and stood from Venus as the love 
goddess stood, wobbily, from her landing spot.

Venus turned to face her other two fellow senshi and she couldn&#39;t help 
but wonder where the guardians were. Probably taking care of Chibi Usa.

The youma headbutted(more like bulldozed) Sailors Moon and Mars out of 
its path. They flew back and fell onto Mercury.

Venus turned to face the monster as it stood up to its full height. 
Funny, Venus thought, it seemed smaller. Maybe it was the dented 
streetlight casting shadows. Yeah thats it.

The love seshi charged the youma again. But this time however, it walked 
towards her and as she lept at it again, it backhanded her and she went 
flying onc again; this time hitting the railing around the lake with her 
back and flipping over it. She landed in the mud, the water slashing up 
around her legs. Venus tried to stand. SHe got up to her feet and leaned 
on the railing then flipped back over it, landing on her face. The youma 
picked her up by the back of her neck and held her close to it&#39;s &quot;face&quot;. 
It had no real facial features, just eyes, glowing white.

Sailor Venus felt its other hand come up and circle around her throat 
and felt it began to squeeze. Venus closed her eyes, her body to weak 
and sore to fight back. She didn&#39;t know what happened to the others. 
Were they trying to find a way to get her away from the youma with out 
hurting her or were they just waiting for the oppurtune time to attack? 
Where are they?

Thats when Venus heard it. A roar that reminded her of Yung Hu. But..he 
was dead. Was it maybe Raigia? He hadn&#39;t shown up so far...it had to 
have been him. Then she was free. Venus dropped to the ground as the 
youma that was holding her was ripped from her.

Venus coughed and looked up. And did a double take. A large cat was 
attacking the youma. It kept dodging towards it, slashing or biting at 
it then back out of harms way. The cat kept this up until the youma 
finally died, turning to dust before hitting the ground.

The other senshi came up to Venus, checking on her. Did they not see the 
cat? It was white with black stripes. Or were those shadows? Venus was 
too out of it to tell. It had glowing, ice blue eyes and something 
golden was shining between its eyes. Was that a halo?

It looked at the group a moment longer before retreating into the dark.

The senshi stood from their spots on the ground. Venus began to limp 
back towards the ware house.

&quot;Minako, where are you going?&quot;

&quot;To take over my watch of Makoto, Usagi. Its my turn tonight.&quot;

&#147;I know that, Minako. But you&#146;re more badly injured than us,&#148; Usagi 
said. &#147;Would you like one of us to finish your post?&#148;

&#147;No. I&#146;ll be ok. They&#146;re just some bruises. Ja ne.&#148; And she left as 
quickly as she could without actually running.

Minako slowly crept back inside the warehouse. Makoto was still in her 
corner. Artemis was laying atop her sleeping bag.

&#147;You look hurt,&#148; he commented. &#147;Did you win?&#148;

&#147;Am I alive?&#148; Artemis nodded. &#147;Then we won.&#148;

Artemis snorted. &#147;Well I&#146;m going to go. I&#146;m hungry.&#148;

&#147;Ja, then,&#148; Minako said.

&#147;Ja.&#148; And the cat left.

Minako slid down the wall slowly until she hit the floor. Her tired eyes 
fell onto Makoto&#146;s and Minako sighed sadly. She picked up her cd player 
and stood again. She walked over to Makoto who was glaring at her. Not 
in a mean way, but just a cautious one. Minako leaned agaisnt the wall 
nearest to Makoto and slid down it. She placed her head phones on over 
her ears, pushed play and it wasn&#146;t long before she fell asleep.

Makoto, however stayed awake. She snorted and smoke rose out of her 
nostrils. With her tail, she gently picked Minako up, sat her between 
her large front legs and laid her long neck over her for warmth.

Lying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you&#39;re so sincere
How could our love be so blind

We sailed on together
But we drifted apart
And here you are by my side

So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you&#39;ll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you home

But now that you&#39;ve come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay

So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am with open arms
Hoping you&#39;ll see what your love means to me
Open arms

Rei yanwed as she made her way inside the warehouse to relieve Minako of 
her duties. As she stepped inside, she glanced round for Minako but 
didn&#146;t see her. SHrugging, Rei turned to face Makoto&#146;s corner and 
dropped her breakfast bag.

In the corner was no longer a dragon. Buit a woman with long chestnut 
brown hair, laying nude with a blonde in her lap and white wings drapped 
around them both.

Makoto was back.</pre>
