<h1>Sailor Moon V: The Dark Adventures of the Sailor Scouts (part 1 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tstanton.html">Troy "Silver" Stanton</a><br> </h2>
<pre>(Historian&#39;s Note: This story followed along the original Sailor Moon 
plot line up until this point. It branches off into a parallel story 
line I like to call Sailor Moon V, or &quot;The Dark Adventures of the 
Sailor Scouts.&quot; This episode takes place after the discovery of Ami 
Mizuno as Sailor Mercury, but before any of the other Sailor Scouts 
are found.) 

Beryl thought about who Moirah would most likely be reporting to and 
what exactly she would be reporting. She finally arrived at a probable 
answer and relaxed. Had the information been a really important 
secret, Moirah could be trusted not to breathe a word to Nephlyte. But 
something as simple as an assignment for a Dragoon agent was no big 
deal. 

The dark queen made another mental note to have a nice, quiet 
discussion with her bodyguard about politics and loyalty. Queen Beryl 
smiled to herself and wondered just how the conversation would go. 
Still smiling, she idly let her hand wander through the cool waters of 
the fountain. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

It was a typical, lazy Sunday afternoon. The sun was warm, the breeze 
was light and cool, the birds were out singing, and Ami Mizuno was 
holed up in her room studying. 

&quot;We have seen that multiplying (or dividing) the sides of an equation 
by a non-zero number give us a new, correct equation. Moreover, adding 
a multiple of one equation in a system gives us another correct 
equation. Finally, if we interchange two equations in a system of 
equations, we obtain an equivalent system.&quot; 

There was no warning, no chance for Ami to see it coming. With a loud 
whoosh, she was blasted out of her chair and onto the floor by the 
opening shot of an impending pillow fight. And she could only think of 
one person who would dare do such a thing while she was studying. 

&quot;Good morning, Serena,&quot; she said, her normally crystalline voice 
muffled by the fluffy mass of pillow on her face. She batted the 
pillow off and glared at her adversary and best friend. 

&quot;Hi, Ami,&quot; came Serena&#39;s cheerfully innocent voice. &quot;I knew you could 
use a break from studying, but why are you taking it on the floor?&quot; 
Her grin grew impossibly wide as she looked at Ami. 

Ami looked up, smirked, and tossed a pillow halfway across the room. 
&quot;Oh, I think you&#39;ll find out soon enough.&quot; She looked at Serena again, 
made a quick mental calculation, and kicked the pillow another few 
inches to the left. 

Serena shook her head in confusion, sending her bizarre ponytails 
swaying. &quot;Huh? And what makes you think I&#39;m going to wind up on the 
floor?&quot; And just like her friend, she never saw it coming. 

The black cat that had been carefully sneaking up behind her let out a 
blood-curdling howl. Serena squealed in fear as she turned around to 
look for the disturbance, tripped over her own feet, and promptly 
landed face-first on the pillow. 

&quot;Serves you right for sneaking up on poor Ami like that,&quot; the cat 
chided. She paused to stretch before sitting down and grooming her 
fur. &quot;You really ought to be learning from her studying habits, 
Serena, instead of trying to disrupt them.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks, Luna,&quot; said Ami as she fussed with her rumpled blue-tinted 
hair. She heard Serena mutter something acidic and laughed. &quot;Well, you 
did ask for it this time, Serena.&quot; She stood up and straightened her 
dress. 

Serena got up very slowly. &quot;Just trying to get you to lighten up, 
that&#39;s all. It&#39;s a wonderful day outside, and you&#39;re in here with your 
nose buried in a book again. You should get out more often.&quot; 

&quot;I was studying while I was waiting for you two to get up so we could 
go out and do something,&quot; came the tart reply. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault I 
like to get up sometime before lunch.&quot; Luna yawned. &quot;Don&#39;t look at me, 
I was up at nine. I was just enjoying the view out in the garden.&quot; She 
arched her tail toward Serena. &quot;She was the one who was snoring until 
eleven.&quot; 

&quot;Hey! It&#39;s not my fault I snore while I sleep! I can&#39;t help that!&quot; Her 
blue eyes became slightly wider as she got upset. 

Ami&#39;s own blue eyes twinkled as she smiled. &quot;It must be that big mouth 
of yours,&quot; she teased. She barely had enough time to dodge the 
red-lace pillow that was thrown in her direction. She dropped back 
into a modified defense posture, ready for the next attack. 

&quot;Oh yeah?!&quot; The blonde grabbed a pair of fluffy green pillows, tossed 
one to Ami, then charged forward to attack. Ami parried, then swung 
her pillow in a broad arc. Serena dodged and the battle commenced. 

Luna carefully made her way around the melee and over to Ami&#39;s soft 
bed. She leapt up, being cautious not to scratch anything in the 
process. Sighing heavily, she settled down to watch the duel, hoping 
they wouldn&#39;t accidentally use her as target practice. 

&quot;Why do I have the feeling that this is going to be one of those 
days?&quot; she asked the teddy bear next to her. Fortunately for her 
sanity, the stuffed animal didn&#39;t respond. There was a high-pitched 
squeal from the midst of the fight and Luna was buried beneath a mass 
of fluff. &quot;This is probably why,&quot; she said to nobody in particular. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolaris looked up from his work as a silver-haired Dragoon entered his 
private chambers. Occasionally he wondered what it would be like if he 
wasn&#39;t immune to her telepathic-based sex appeal, but never seriously 
considered it. There were a time and place for everything and being a 
Dragoon meant one never had much time for play. 

&quot;You sent for me, Commander?&quot; she said. 

&quot;Yes, Shar-Tei. I have an assignment to do, one that requires me to 
spend my time elsewhere. During my absence you will be in command of 
the Dragoons.&quot; 

&quot;Of course, Tolaris. I am puzzled why you would volunteer to do 
mundane research about the humans on Earth when you could send someone 
else.&quot; 

Tolaris gave his second-in-command an amused look. &quot;Let me guess. The 
aquamorph told Nephlyte like she was paid to do, Zoisite&#39;s spies 
overheard the report and told her, she told her bedmate Malachite 
about the plan, and your surveillance of Malachite&#39;s activities let 
you in on the information.&quot; Shar-Tei&#39;s featureless red eyes seemed to 
twinkle. &quot;Word travels fast in the intelligence division,&quot; she said 
demurely. &quot;No intelligence leaks here,&quot; Tolaris muttered to himself. 
He looked up at Shar-Tei. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that I could use a change of 
pace every now and then. Let&#39;s see you spend nine decades as the 
Dragoon commander and see if you don&#39;t start clawing the walls for 
some time off.&quot; 

The Dragoon officer shook her head slowly. &quot;We were wondering when you 
would finally get around to taking a vacation.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not a vacation, it&#39;s a field assignment,&quot; he muttered. 

&quot;An easy field assignment,&quot; she shot back. 

Tolaris finally smiled. &quot;So what if it is? Too late anyway. You&#39;ve got 
command of the Dragoons now, not me. See you later, Lieutenant 
Commander.&quot; He waved and walked out, leaving a startled Shar-Tei 
behind. 

He walked down the shadowy corridors of the Dragoon castle, heading in 
the direction of the underground tunnel that lead to Queen Beryl&#39;s 
castle. As he entered the tunnel entrance, he became aware of a dark 
figure leaning against a wall. As he approached, the figure stood up 
and spoke to him. 

&quot;I would speak with you, Commander Tolaris,&quot; he said in a strong 
voice. 

Tolaris bowed slightly as he recognized the voice. &quot;General Nephlyte. 
What can I do for you?&quot; 

&quot;A simple matter, really. During your visit to Earth, I would like you 
to search around for a suitable site for a cathedral. I am giving 
thought to seeing how my astroglobe would work beneath another set of 
stars and Earth looks like an ideal testing ground.&quot; 

A strange look passed over the Dragoon&#39;s face. &quot;I see. And you 
couldn&#39;t consult your.... astroglobe to tell you where such a site 
might be?&quot; 

Nephlyte smiled. &quot;The stars know everything, but they don&#39;t always 
tell what they know.&quot; 

&quot;So that&#39;s why you bribe the aquamorph for information,&quot; Tolaris said 
in a flat tone. 

Nephlyte laughed, something which he rarely did these days. &quot;Ah, yes, 
I forgot how much you hate politics. Let me explain this one, my dear 
Commander. Moirah and I trade information. She tells me everything 
except the really classified stuff and I tell her everything I know 
about recent rumors and such regarding assassination plots against 
Queen Beryl. It is my understanding that with my help, she has put an 
end to at least forty-six such attempts.&quot; 

&quot;So she is seen as a truly effective bodyguard while you gain the 
upper hand in your schemes against the other generals.&quot; 

The dark-haired general chuckled. &quot;And people wonder why she put you 
in charge of gathering intelligence.&quot; 

&quot;And I take it your new site for your astroglobe is another scheme to 
use against Jedyt and the others?&quot; Tolaris said with a weary 
expression. 

Nephlyte&#39;s face grew somber. &quot;No, Commander, I assure you that this 
one is for other reasons. If I can continue my work on Earth, I can 
get out of Beryl&#39;s immediate wrath-radius but still keep in touch if 
needed. Surely you can appreciate that.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded in agreement, his gray eyes twinkling with amusement. 
&quot;All too easily. In fact, that&#39;s one of the minor reasons why I&#39;m 
going on this assignment. Very well, General, I will see if I can find 
a suitable location for your cathedral.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Tolaris.&quot; Nephlyte reached into a pocket and pulled out an 
iridescent crystal pendant on a fine gold chain. &quot;If you wish, you can 
borrow this for the duration of your field assignment. It will open a 
portal between Earth and the Negaverse so you may travel between the 
two with ease.&quot; 

The Dragoon&#39;s eyes widened slightly. He knew that only a handful of 
the Silkworm crystals existed, and to be given the use of one was not 
to be taken lightly. He wordlessly accepted the jewel, then watched as 
Nephlyte turned around and disappeared into the tunnel. 

Tolaris walked along the corridor until he came to a relatively 
isolated section. Don&#39;t want to disturb anyone when this thing goes 
off, he thought. Ok, assuming that the humans haven&#39;t changed much in 
a thousand years, the information I need to know would most likely be 
in a public library. And since it&#39;s public, it&#39;d be someplace where 
everyone can easily get to it. 

He focused his thoughts on what he knew of the current map of downtown 
Tokyo. Randomly picking a point, he channeled his thoughts into the 
crystal. Immediately, a whirling vortex opened up in the wall of the 
corridor. On the other side he could see a dark alley in some part of 
town. 

&quot;Next stop, the local library,&quot; he said to himself as he stepped 
through the wormhole and into the world called Earth. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Serena and Ami were walking along one of the main streets in town. 
Serena was dressed in her favorite pink sweater and blue jeans while 
Ami was wearing one of her better aquamarine dresses. Luna was happily 
being carried by Ami as the two wandered the streets. 

&quot;Ok, so now that we&#39;re all up and dressed, where should we go?&quot; Ami 
asked her friends. 

&quot;The park should look nice this time of year,&quot; Luna said. 

&quot;But it&#39;s way too chilly,&quot; Serena complained. &quot;We should go someplace 
exciting where it&#39;s nice and warm.&quot; 

&quot;Let me guess. The arcade?&quot; Ami sighed. 

Serena&#39;s blue eyes lit up. &quot;Of course! All those games generate lots 
of heat to keep us warm, we&#39;re out of the wind which is starting to 
ruin my hair, aaaand....&quot; 

&quot;And you get to see Andrew,&quot; Luna muttered darkly. 

&quot;Of course, that&#39;s the coolest part.&quot; Serena said in a singsong tone. 

Ami sighed again and wondered where exactly she went wrong in having a 
semi-ditz as her best friend. She started thinking about it and didn&#39;t 
see the dark figure step out of the alley in front of her. The figure 
didn&#39;t see her either and they collided. 

Luna managed to leap free and, having the natural grace and agility of 
a cat, landed on her feet. Ami, however, was not so lucky and landed 
hard on her behind with a squeal. There was a grunt as the other 
person also landed on his rear. 

&quot;Ami! You all right?&quot; Serena knelt down beside her friend, her eyes 
wide with concern. 

&quot;I&#39;m fine. Sorry about that,&quot; she said to her new acquaintance as he 
picked himself up off of the concrete. 

&quot;No harm done,&quot; he said as he helped her up. &quot;Wasn&#39;t quite watching 
where I was going either. You okay?&quot; he asked with some concern. He 
quickly looked her over for cuts or bruises. Great way to meet 
someone, he thought ruefully. 

&quot;Sure.&quot; She looked around briefly. &quot;Luna, you okay?&quot; She heard a soft 
meow behind her. &quot;Good. Didn&#39;t mean to dump you like that.&quot; She looked 
at Serena, who merely smiled. 

&quot;Excuse me, but would you mind telling me where the local library is? 
I&#39;m new to the city, and I think I&#39;ve gotten lost,&quot; the gentleman 
asked in a gentle voice. 

Ami looked up at him. He looked to be in his late twenties, with black 
hair reaching his strange uniform collar. His gray-green eyes seemed 
to study everything as he looked around. For a brief instant, Ami 
caught the feeling of evil close by, but it faded so quickly she 
wasn&#39;t sure she didn&#39;t imagine it. 

&quot;Not really. It&#39;s only six blocks from here. I&#39;m headed there myself 
and I&#39;d be happy to take you there.&quot; She blinked in surprise as that 
last sentence came out. She had said it on impulse, something which 
she usually didn&#39;t do. 

&quot;Hey, I thought we were headed to the arcade,&quot; Serena protested. 

&quot;No, you were, remember? I still have some research to do for my 
biology assignment that&#39;s due next month. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll catch up 
with you and Luna later in the afternoon.&quot; Serena was about to say 
more when she felt Luna&#39;s claws tugging on her socks. She had learned 
quickly that this meant Luna had something important to say but 
couldn&#39;t do so with others around. 

&quot;Uh, sure, Ami. How about four o&#39;clock at the pizza place?&quot; The 
tugging on her socks grew more insistent. 

&quot;Sounds good to me. See you later, Serena.&quot; She turned to her strange 
companion. &quot;It&#39;s down this way,&quot; she said as he led him down the 
street in the direction of the library. 

Serena sighed and picked up her furry friend. &quot;All right, Luna, what 
is it? You were starting to put holes in my socks.&quot; 

&quot;I could have sworn I felt some bad vibes when Ami first ran into him. 
He might be from the Negaverse.&quot; 

&quot;You sure, Luna? I didn&#39;t feel anything, and he seems nice enough. Not 
all that cute, but it looks like Ami thinks so.&quot; She smiled. 

&quot;Serena, get serious! Ami could be in trouble. Besides, something 
about her behavior puzzles me. She told me about her biology project, 
but she said she would be going to the library next week and Ami isn&#39;t 
one to change her plans on an impulse.&quot; 

&quot;Relax, Luna. Ami&#39;s smart enough to know what she&#39;s doing. Besides, 
you know how she needs to get out more. Finding a boyfriend would 
definitely help her social life, and I think she&#39;s on her way to 
getting one. Come on, the arcade is down this way.&quot; 

Luna just sighed as Serena happily made her way down the street in the 
direction of the arcade. Why do I even bother? Luna wondered. I just 
hope Ami knows what she&#39;s doing. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

What am I doing? Ami thought for the thousandth time. I wasn&#39;t 
supposed to go to the library until next week, and here I am on my way 
there now with a complete stranger. She took a deep breath. One way to 
fix that, she thought. 

&quot;I don&#39;t believe we&#39;ve properly met. Ami Mizuno,&quot; she said. 

Her companion chuckled. &quot;Commander Tolaris Sterling,&quot; he said. &quot;And 
no, running into each other on a street corner isn&#39;t quite the proper 
method of meeting someone.&quot; Well that went smoothly, he thought. He 
knew that humans had two names, and since he only had one he borrowed 
the name of his great- grandfather as his last name. 

&quot;Commander? You&#39;re in the military? But I&#39;ve never seen that kind of 
uniform before,&quot; she said, gesturing to his dark blue uniform. 

&quot;Elite military intelligence,&quot; he explained. &quot;There&#39;s not a lot of us, 
so it&#39;s common for people not to recognize our uniforms.&quot; As he 
talked, he kept glancing over at Ami. Blue-tinted hair was a rarity in 
the Negaverse and he found it quite attractive. Goes well with her 
blue eyes, he thought. 

Ami looked up to find Tolaris staring at her. &quot;What?&quot; she asked with 
some concern. 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen very many people with hair like 
yours.&quot; He paused briefly. &quot;It is natural, right?&quot; 

Ami laughed. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s quite natural.&quot; 

&quot;Natural beauty is a rarity these days.&quot; 

Ami blushed and almost stopped walking. She looked up at Tolaris to 
find him busy looking at the street signs. &quot;This way, right?&quot; he said 
as he pointed to the left. 

&quot;Uh, right,&quot; she said. 

Tolaris smiled at her again. What is it about her? he thought. She was 
rather pretty but still very young. So why am I starting to flirt with 
her? He thought about it for a few more seconds before shoving the 
whole mess onto a back burner in his mind with a note to examine it 
further. 

&quot;So what brings you to this part of Tokyo? I thought all of the 
military bases were farther up north,&quot; Ami asked with curiosity. 

Tolaris thought quickly. &quot;Research. I understand that your library has 
a few books that I can&#39;t find on the base library.&quot; 

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind my asking, what kind of research?&quot; 

Inquisitive little tart, he thought. &quot;Well.... let&#39;s just say it 
involves astrophysics....&quot; 

&quot;I see,&quot; Ami said knowingly. &quot;Classified research, then.&quot; 

Tolaris gently took Ami by the elbow. &quot;Now that you know, I&#39;ll have to 
kill you,&quot; he said in a stern tone. He had to laugh as her blue eyes 
became impossibly wide. &quot;I&#39;m only teasing. It&#39;s not often I get a 
chance to say that to people.&quot; 

&quot;Hmpf,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s not all that funny, Commander Sterling.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; he said as he released her elbow. &quot;And I&#39;d be happy if you 
would call me Tolaris. I get enough of the &#39;Commander&#39; stuff back 
home.&quot; 

&quot;Sure,&quot; Ami smiled. She paused as something occurred to her. &quot;Uh, why 
would a small library like ours have something important that a big 
library like yours wouldn&#39;t have?&quot; 

Tolaris stopped cold in his tracks and looked at Ami. &quot;We don&#39;t know,&quot; 
he said slowly. &quot;That&#39;s one of the minor reasons why I&#39;m down here.&quot; 
Either I&#39;m getting rusty or she&#39;s unbelievably intelligent, he 
thought. Probably both. 

&quot;Here we are,&quot; she announced, pointing to a brick building behind him. 
&quot;Tokyo&#39;s Wataru Branch Library.&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Thank you for your help, Ami. I hope I can return the 
favor one day.&quot; 

Ami smiled back. &quot;No problem. If you need any help, I&#39;ll be studying 
in the Biology section against the far wall.&quot; 

&quot;Again, my thanks,&quot; the Dragoon said as they entered the building and 
went in opposite directions. Ami headed to the back of the library 
while Tolaris went in the general direction of the encyclopedias. 

He selected several different volumes, first concentrating on general, 
social, and cultural histories. As an afterthought, he picked up a 
volume that involved the space program and another regarding weather 
patterns. Might come in handy, he thought as he sat at a table and 
started reading. 

Occasionally he would pull an amber crystal out of a pocket and hold 
it over a page. The crystal would hum briefly as it photocopied the 
text into its memory. Then before anyone could notice what he was 
doing, he would hide the gem back in his pocket. Don&#39;t need anyone 
asking questions about strange gems, he thought. 

Tolaris lost track of time as he read through page after page of 
history and other information. He had just finished with the book on 
weather and was about to start in on a section about contemporary 
economics when someone set a large book down in front of him. 
Startled, he looked up. 

&quot;I thought this might help,&quot; Ami said as she gestured to the book&#39;s 
title. Tolaris glanced down, and his eyebrows went up as he read the 
title. 

&quot;Neo-classical Astrophysics. You know, this just might be one of the 
things I&#39;m looking for.&quot; He quickly leafed through it and stopped when 
he came to a complex diagram that looked familiar. He read the passage 
and it was all he could do to keep calm. 

The diagram and accompanying equations showed how a person could 
predict irregular orbital patterns. There was a high degree of 
inaccuracy involved if there were more than one celestial object in 
the orbit, but it was still quite useful. General Nephlyte had spent 
decades trying to figure out the orbits of the Negaverse&#39;s moons and 
once said he would pay dearly for any information that would help him 
solve the puzzle. 

&quot;Ami, you&#39;re wonderful. This is exactly what I&#39;ve been looking for.&quot; 
Not quite, he thought as he pulled out a pen and a piece of paper, but 
this is something extremely useful. Tolaris knew that the weather was 
influenced by the tidal forces of celestial moons and if he could 
predict what forces were going to cause which storms where, he could 
increase his powers tenfold. 

Like all of the Negaverse denizens, Tolaris had a few semi-unique 
special powers. Although the majority of the skills wielded by the 
denizens were weak, there were a few like Tolaris who were 
exceptionally powerful. And Tolaris&#39; strongest power was his ability 
to control the weather. 

A major factor of his powers was the weather currently in the area at 
the time. He could cause it to snow during a blistering heat wave, but 
it would be a weak snow. If there was a cold front and lots of 
moisture-laden clouds in the area, he could cause a full-scale 
blizzard to occur within a matter of seconds. Knowledge is power, and 
if he knew ahead of time what the prevailing weather would be like, he 
could use that to his utmost advantage. 

One problem, he thought as he scribbled down the equations. Nephlyte 
has to get this to work first. Otherwise, this is going to be a moot 
point. He looked up and smiled at Ami. 

&quot;You&#39;ve been an incredible help to me, Ami. If you don&#39;t mind, I&#39;d 
like to thank you by buying you dinner tomorrow night. I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll 
be quite busy with other business before then, so I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t do 
it sooner.&quot; 

Ami blushed. &quot;Oh, you don&#39;t have to do that. It&#39;d be entirely too much 
trouble and all....&quot; 

&quot;Which is nothing compared to the trouble you&#39;ve saved me,&quot; Tolaris 
said truthfully. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t for your help, I wouldn&#39;t have found 
either this library or that book until much later. Besides, my 
conscience wouldn&#39;t allow me to let you get away without some sort of 
payback.&quot; Which isn&#39;t all that far off the truth, he thought. 

Ami&#39;s blush deepened as several things occurred to her. She was about 
to say no since she would probably have homework to do, but again an 
impulse took over and she decided she could do it beforehand. Besides, 
she thought, I&#39;ve never been on a date before and now seems like a 
good time to fix that. 

&quot;Well,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;Since you put it that way, I don&#39;t see how I 
can refuse.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful. Since I don&#39;t know where you live and I won&#39;t know where I 
will be at any particular time, what say we meet at the park around 
five? It would give us plenty of time to enjoy dinner and a walk in 
the park, yet still have enough time to get you home at a decent 
hour.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d like that, Tolaris. Thank you.&quot; 

The Dragoon chuckled. &quot;No, thank you. For everything.&quot; He stood up and 
kissed her hand, causing her blush a delightful shade of red. &quot;Now I 
don&#39;t mean to be rude here, but you might want to get back to your 
friend. It&#39;s well past four.&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes went wide as she realized he was right. &quot;Oh! Uh, thank you. 
See you at the park at five tomorrow!&quot; She waved a hasty goodbye and 
ran for the door. 

Tolaris chuckled again as he watched Ami&#39;s form dash across the 
streets. Then his mood grew somber as he thought of other things. It&#39;s 
just as well that she left, he thought. He casually made his way to 
the back section of the library. Making sure no one could see him, he 
pulled an onyx crystal out of a pocket and hid it behind a row of 
books. 

This device will serve as my first trap, he thought. The gem was a 
time- delayed energy collector. It would activate in one hour, 
draining all of the energy out of anyone who happened to be near it. A 
simple touch or a focused energy blast would deactivate it so the 
Sailor Scouts should be able to turn it off quite easily. 

Only thing is, he thought, if it gets turned off, it&#39;ll do a thorough 
scan of whatever touched it. And if it works right, I just might get a 
fingerprint or even a DNA scan of one of those Sailor Scouts. Or at 
least a very detailed scan of their special powers. 

He walked back to the opposite side of the library, just out of the 
gem&#39;s field-effect radius. And when they get here, all they&#39;ll find is 
a glowing gem and a room full of drained humans, he thought with a 
silent chuckle. Plus one Dragoon who&#39;s pretending to be drained. 

Smiling to himself, Commander Tolaris sat back down to read the 
passage on contemporary economics, occasionally taking notes with his 
strange crystal. Queen Beryl&#39;s going to love this, he thought. Who 
would have thought that the humans could develop something like this? 
Amazing.... 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;This isn&#39;t like Ami at all,&quot; said Luna as she paced in circles. Her 
tail lashed back and forth as she grew more concerned by the minute. 
&quot;Usually, it&#39;s Ami who&#39;s waiting for you to show up, Serena, not the 
other way around.&quot; 

Serena made a face. &quot;Thanks, Luna. But still, you know how Ami gets 
when she&#39;s studying. She&#39;s probably still sitting there with her nose 
in a book.&quot; 

Luna paused to consider this. &quot;Well, you could be right.&quot; She perked 
her ears up at a sound. &quot;That sounds like her now.&quot; 

Serena was almost bowled over by a blue-haired tornado. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m 
late,&quot; Ami said, panting heavily. &quot;I kinda lost track of time. Hope I 
haven&#39;t kept you waiting too long.&quot; 

&quot;Only about ten minutes,&quot; said Luna, &quot;Even though we were supposed to 
meet half an hour ago,&quot; she said, giving Serena a meaningful look. 

&quot;What happened, your study of biology take an interesting turn?&quot; joked 
Serena. She blinked as Ami blushed for no apparent reason. 

&quot;You could say that. Tolaris invited me to dinner tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Who?&quot; chorused Serena and Luna. 

&quot;Tolaris,&quot; she repeated. &quot;You know, the guy I bumped into several 
hours ago? Well, I helped him with a bit of his research and he wanted 
to thank me by taking me out to dinner tomorrow night.&quot; 

Serena smiled. &quot;Boy, that was fast, Ami. You run over a guy on a 
street corner and it&#39;s not four hours before you two start dating.&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re not dating, Serena.&quot; 

&quot;Not yet,&quot; the blonde teased. 

&quot;Ami, how much do you know about this Tolaris?&quot; asked Luna. &quot;I would 
have thought he would be way too old for you.&quot; 

Ami blinked. &quot;Umm, I never got around to asking how old he was. He 
said he was a commander in the military intelligence division and that 
he needed a few books that our library had. I think it&#39;s classified, 
but he mentioned it involved a bit of astrophysics.&quot; 

&quot;That sounds like the space program,&quot; Luna said. 

Serena elbowed her friend in the ribs. &quot;Wow, Ami, not only do you have 
a thing for older men, you also like a man in uniform. How come you 
never told me this before?&quot; 

&quot;Serena!&quot; Ami said, blushing furiously. 

&quot;I think you are making this out to be something that it isn&#39;t, 
Serena,&quot; Luna chided the blonde. 

&quot;Perhaps, but I smell romance in the air.&quot; She paused and took a small 
whiff of the air. &quot;That, and a pepperoni pizza with our name on it. 
Come on,&quot; she said as she grabbed Ami&#39;s wrist. &quot;Let&#39;s go get dinner.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, calm down. You want me to bring you anything, Luna?&quot; 

Luna was about to say something when she caught motion out of the 
corner of her eye. She turned to look and her eyes lit up. &quot;Actually, 
no thanks,&quot; she said as she followed the movement. &quot;I&#39;ll just stay out 
here and.... uh.... keep an eye on things....&quot; 

Serena knew that look. &quot;Field mouse?&quot; she said, faintly disgusted. 

&quot;Cricket,&quot; the cat corrected. &quot;Excuse me.&quot; Luna leapt high into the 
air and landed running, pursuing the cricket into the bushes. 

&quot;Ugh. How can she eat those.... bugs?&quot; Serena said with a sour 
expression on her face. 

&quot;Protein,&quot; commented Ami. 

Serena gave her a strange look. 

&quot;Variety?&quot; Ami suggested. 

&quot;Thanks for sharing that, Ami.&quot; 

&quot;Well, she is a cat after all. Come on, I&#39;m getting hungry.&quot; 

Serena just stared at her friend&#39;s innocent expression. &quot;You&#39;ve got to 
be kidding me.&quot; 

&quot;Well, I haven&#39;t eaten since we left the house and that was quite 
awhile ago. Besides, you&#39;re the one who&#39;s always hungry.&quot; 

Serena sighed as they entered the restaurant. &quot;I think I&#39;ll just stick 
with a salad and bread sticks this time....&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Salad and bread sticks, huh?&quot; teased Ami as they left the restaurant. 

&quot;Well.... Umm.... That pizza smell kinda made me change my mind....&quot; 

&quot;Some change of mind. You ate six slices of pizza after you virtually 
ate half of the salad bar.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry, Ami, but I was hungry,&quot; protested Serena. 

A loud purring sound ripped through the air like a saw. Ami and Serena 
exchanged looks before trying to find the source of the sound. Several 
seconds later they found Luna stretched out on her back and being 
gently scratched by a man in dark clothes. 

&quot;Darian, get away from my cat!&quot; screamed Serena in anger as she ran to 
get Luna. She picked her up and checked her for cuts or other signs of 
injury. 

&quot;This is your cat, meatball head?&quot; he said with some disgust. 

&quot;Yes it is, so you can keep your grubby hands off of her!&quot; 

&quot;With pleasure.&quot; His icy tone softened slightly as he noticed Ami 
standing next to Serena. &quot;Tell me, Ami, with all of your genius, why 
do you hang around with this ditz?&quot; 

&quot;Because she&#39;s my friend,&quot; Ami said defensively. 

Darian looked like he was going to say something, then changed his 
mind. &quot;To each their own. Take care, Ami,&quot; he said as he turned around 
and walked away. 

Luna waited until he was gone before speaking up. &quot;I don&#39;t understand 
the problem, Serena. I rather enjoy having my belly rubbed after a 
good meal and he was doing a fine job until you stormed over here and 
started yelling. What is it with you and Darian?&quot; 

Serena made a foul face. &quot;He&#39;s a creep, that&#39;s what.&quot; 

Ami was about to make a comment when an icy wind blew through her 
bones. She blinked and looked at Serena. Her friend looked like 
someone had shoved an ice cube down her sweater. 

&quot;Yiii!&quot; she squealed, shivering lightly. &quot;What was that?&quot; 

&quot;I felt it too. What do you think it could have been, Luna?&quot; 

The cat&#39;s ears were flat against her head. &quot;I sense evil. It feels 
like the Negaverse is around somewhere. Ami, use your computer and see 
if you can pinpoint anything strange.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; Ami reached into her pocket and pulled out what looked to be 
a typical make-up compact. She flipped it open to reveal a miniature 
keyboard and computer screen. She did some quick typing and a blinking 
light appeared on the screen. 

&quot;Got it. There&#39;s some sort of energy disturbance a few blocks from 
here. Checking the map now....&quot; She pushed a button and a detailed map 
of the city was overlaid on the screen. Ami felt the color drain from 
her face as she recognized the area. 

&quot;It&#39;s in the library!&quot; she said, her voice laced with concern. Tolaris 
is still in there, she thought. 

&quot;Then I think you two should deal with this threat right now. There&#39;s 
no one around, so you can transform right here,&quot; said Luna. 

Serena looked dismayed. &quot;Does this mean we have to fight another 
monster? I&#39;m still healing from the last one.&quot; 

&quot;No time to argue, Serena!&quot; snapped Ami. &quot;Let&#39;s get going!&quot; She pulled 
a silver cylinder out of her pocket and held it over her head. 
&quot;Mercury Power!&quot; she yelled, and was immediately wrapped in a field of 
light and energy. 

Within seconds, her clothing had dissolved and reformed into the 
blouse and skirt of her Sailor suit. Her shoes melted into a mass of 
light that crept up her legs and solidified into her boots. Beams of 
energy wrapped around her arms and formed gloves. Stray tendrils of 
light merged into bows on her blouse and skirt. A cloud of motes 
coalesced to form a pair of sapphire earrings and a beautiful jeweled 
tiara, and the transformation was complete. 

Serena sighed. &quot;All right, all right, keep your skirt on, Mercury.&quot; 
She let her hand pass over the brooch on her sweater collar before 
raising it up to the sky. &quot;Moon Prism Power!&quot; she yelled. She then 
underwent the same process of transformation Mercury went through, but 
the only differences were her earrings were gold and a pair of ruby 
barrettes was added to her bizarre hairstyle. 

&quot;Hey, wait up!&quot; Sailor Moon yelled as she took off running after 
Mercury. 

&quot;I hate running on a full stomach,&quot; Luna complained as she darted 
after the two Sailor Scouts. 

&quot;I hate.... running.... period....&quot; Sailor Moon puffed. &quot;I don&#39;t.... 
see why.... she&#39;s in such.... a hurry....&quot; 

Mercury was almost to the library when the others caught up to her, 
still complaining about the run. She bit back an impulse to tell them 
to put a cork in it and focused on the library doors. A sudden thought 
occurred to her and she hoped the doors weren&#39;t locked. Too late now, 
she thought and braced. 

She slammed into the doors at full-tilt and nearly dislocated 
something as the doors refused to open. Behind her, Sailor Moon tried 
to stop and only partially succeeded before running into Mercury. 
There was a loud and vicious curse as they fell onto the grass in a 
jumble of arms and legs. 

&quot;Sailor Moon, such language!&quot; Mercury blushed as she tried to stand. 

&quot;Me? I thought that was you! I don&#39;t even know what that word means.&quot; 

Mercury looked confused as she rubbed a sore spot. &quot;When who...?&quot; 

Their eyes locked as it sank in. &quot;Luna!&quot; they chorused before 
scrambling to their feet. 

Luna groaned in pain as she slowly rolled over. She opened one eye and 
glared at Sailor Mercury. &quot;Mercury, I do believe you&#39;ve put on some 
weight,&quot; she said weakly. &quot;We are going to have to talk about this.... 
after I heal.&quot; 

&quot;Sorry.&quot; She looked up at the slightly dented door. &quot;Well, it&#39;s 
locked, so that means we&#39;ll just have to force it open.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, yeah?&quot; muttered Sailor Moon. &quot;And just how are we supposed to 
force open a heavy door like that without the aid of the army?&quot; 

Mercury didn&#39;t even bother replying. She stood in front of the door 
and concentrated all of her energy into a single mote. &quot;Mercury 
Bubbles....&quot; she intoned. The mote grew into a bubble, then a large 
sphere of energy. She flung her arms out wide and released the energy. 
&quot;BLAST!!&quot; 

The force of the sphere&#39;s impact neatly ripped the door off of its 
hinges and sent it skittering across the library&#39;s carpeted floor. 
Mercury waited for the dust to settle before entering the building. 

&quot;I see....&quot; said Sailor Moon as she followed her friend inside. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolaris was slumped in his chair, looking like every other human in 
the library. At the far end of the building, the onyx gem gave off a 
harsh purple light as it drained the last remaining wisps of energy 
out of the humans caught within its field-effect radius. Every now and 
then the gem would pulse as its negative energy field was altered 
slightly. 

Forgot about that, Tolaris thought as the gem&#39;s radius brushed against 
his arm. Stupid thing doesn&#39;t always maintain a constant radius. He 
sighed darkly as a bit of his own energy was drained away by the 
fluctuating field. If those Sailor Scouts don&#39;t get here soon, I won&#39;t 
have to pretend to be drained. 

His train of thought was interrupted by a large explosion, followed by 
the sound of something heavy sliding across the floor. That&#39;s one way 
to make an entrance, he thought with a silent chuckle. 

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s that?&quot; a voice said. Tolaris didn&#39;t dare open his eyes to 
see who spoke. Don&#39;t need to be giving myself away just quite yet, he 
thought. A sudden idea occurred to him and he thought vile curses. 
This would have been great if I could have gotten a voice-analysis. 
Too bad hindsight only works in reverse. Better luck next time, 
Commander. 

&quot;It looks like it might be what&#39;s causing the energy disturbance,&quot; 
said a second, deeper voice. 

&quot;I&#39;ll say. You see any monsters around?&quot; asked the first voice. 

&quot;No, but let me do a scan first,&quot; said a third voice. 

Tolaris&#39;s blood ran cold. Oh, great, he thought darkly. Sounds like 
I&#39;ve got three of those Scouts to deal with. Queen Beryl is not going 
to like this one bit. 

&quot;This is odd,&quot; said the third voice. 

&quot;What&#39;s up, Mercury?&quot; said the first voice. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m picking up a strange bio-reading, but I can&#39;t make sense of 
it because of the energy field.&quot; 

&quot;Worry about that in a bit. What about that strange light?&quot; asked the 
second voice. 

Tolaris heard the sound of typing, then a series of beeps. Sounds like 
the one named Sailor Mercury has a scanner of sorts, he thought. Good 
that I know, bad that she&#39;s got one. 

&quot;This is even stranger,&quot; said Mercury. &quot;The light is caused by a 
simple, unfocused energy collector. If my scan reads right, any 
contact with it will be enough to deactivate it.&quot; 

&quot;Easy enough,&quot; said the first voice. &quot;I&#39;ll just give it a nice kick.&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Moon, wait! If you enter the collector&#39;s energy field, you&#39;ll 
be drained of your energy like everyone else.&quot; 

&quot;Oh,&quot; said Sailor Moon. &quot;So how do we turn it off from here?&quot; 

&quot;You could use your Moon Tiara,&quot; suggested the second voice. Oh, by 
all means, thought Tolaris, please do. 

&quot;No, I&#39;ve got a faster solution,&quot; said Mercury. There was silence, and 
then Mercury grunted softly. A second later Tolaris felt an energy 
wave wash across the room as the crystal was shattered. 

&quot;Well, that&#39;s one way to do it....&quot; said the second voice. 

&quot;Hey, everyone&#39;s starting to wake up!&quot; came the jubilant voice of 
Sailor Moon. &quot;Looks like we won&#39;t have to fight a monster after all.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s great,&quot; said Mercury. &quot;Now if it&#39;s all the same with you, I 
want to get out of here before they start asking questions about the 
door.&quot; 

&quot;Problem, Mercury?&quot; teased Sailor Moon. 

&quot;Not yet, and there won&#39;t be if we move it now.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps Mercury is right,&quot; said the second voice. &quot;Now would be a 
very good time to leave.&quot; 

Tolaris waited until the sound of their footsteps faded, then counted 
to fifty before pretending to wake up. This is not going very well, he 
thought to himself as he casually made his way over to the shattered 
gem. He started to laugh uncontrollably when he saw what had destroyed 
it. 

&quot;A book,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;They threw a dictionary at it. This is simply 
incredible. No fingerprints, no energy scans, not even a voice print. 
And all I have to report is the possibility of three Sailor Scouts and 
that the one named Mercury has a scanner.&quot; 

He continued to laugh quietly as he made his way out of the library. I 
think I&#39;ll look for Nephlyte&#39;s cathedral site while it&#39;s still light 
out, he thought. Don&#39;t want to turn today into a total failure. Still 
shaking his head in wonder, the Dragoon randomly picked a direction 
and started walking. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ami, I&#39;m surprised at you,&quot; Luna said as she paced back and forth. 
The three of them were in Serena&#39;s room. Serena was playing the home 
arcade version of the Sailor V game while Ami and Luna were sitting on 
Serena&#39;s bed. 

&quot;You usually don&#39;t go rushing off like that without any sort of plan 
in mind,&quot; the black cat continued. &quot;You didn&#39;t even consider the 
possibility of the library doors being locked before trying to rush 
in. I take it you didn&#39;t damage anything in the attempt?&quot; 

Ami blushed and studied the carpet, unable to look at the expression 
on Luna&#39;s face. &quot;Just bruised my shoulders, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

&quot;I consider that lucky, seeing how you managed to dent the door like 
that. What about you, Serena?&quot; 

Serena was busy concentrating on the game and never heard Luna. &quot;Oh, 
come on, you stupid game, I dodged that missile!&quot; 

Ami and Luna exchanged looks. Luna just sighed, shook her head, and 
made a gesture toward Serena. A wicked smile crossed Ami&#39;s face as she 
picked up a pillow and launched it with amazing accuracy. 

There was a loud crack as Serena&#39;s forehead met the hard plastic 
casing of the game. &quot;Hey!&quot; she yelled as she stood up, rubbing a sore 
spot. &quot;What did you do that for?&quot; 

&quot;So we could get your attention away from that game and back to 
business,&quot; Luna responded crisply. &quot;We need to put our heads together 
about the incident at the library. Something about that wasn&#39;t quite 
right.&quot; 

Serena blinked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;She means it was entirely too easy for a Negaverse trap,&quot; Ami 
translated. 

The blonde laughed and airily waved a hand. &quot;We&#39;re just way too good 
for simple traps anymore. There&#39;s nothing to worry about.&quot; 

Luna frowned. &quot;I find that highly unlikely. However, just for the sake 
of argument let&#39;s say that is the case and proceed on to the other 
topic of concern.&quot; 

Serena blinked again. &quot;Like what?&quot; 

&quot;Like Ami&#39;s unusual behavior earlier today,&quot; Luna said with a 
meaningful look at the still-blushing Ami. &quot;I still find it highly 
distressing to see you simply rush into a confrontation without 
thinking about it. It&#39;s something I would expect from Serena, but not 
from you, Ami.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks,&quot; muttered Serena. 

&quot;Well.... I was just.... concerned for the people still in the 
library.&quot; 

&quot;You mean for your boyfriend?&quot; teased Serena. 

Luna&#39;s expression went demonic. &quot;Serena, sit down and put a sock in 
it! This is serious business and we don&#39;t need scatterbrained 
comments.&quot; 

The blonde sat hard on the bed, her wide blue eyes starting to grow 
wet as she became upset. 

&quot;He&#39;s not my boyfriend,&quot; said Ami, still studying the carpet, &quot;But, 
yes, I was rather concerned for him.&quot; 

Luna seemed to calm down. &quot;How&#39;s that?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;I can&#39;t explain it, Luna. I just felt that I had to do something and 
it had to be done immediately.&quot; 

&quot;That might explain your impatience, but what about the rest? You 
never tried to get a second scan on that strange bio-reading you 
reported.&quot; 

&quot;I guess I forgot about that....&quot; 

&quot;And what about the door?&quot; said Serena. &quot;I didn&#39;t think blasting your 
way through obstacles was your style, Ami.&quot; 

Ami closed her eyes and tried not to get upset. &quot;I don&#39;t know, okay?&quot; 

Luna blinked and backed off. &quot;Ami, is everything all right at home? 
Any problems that might be affecting you?&quot; she asked gently. 

Ami shook her head. &quot;Nothing that I&#39;m aware of.&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps you&#39;ve been studying just a little too hard, Ami. I think you 
could use a nice, long break from all of that book work you do,&quot; 
Serena said. 

Ami looked up, a strange look in her blue eyes. &quot;Maybe you&#39;re right.&quot; 

Luna stretched. &quot;Well, that could be one possibility.&quot; 

Serena stood up and smiled. &quot;And I think that your dinner date with 
that guy you met should be enough to do the job. You should kick back 
and take it easy that night. Forget about school and everything. Just 
talk with him, take a relaxing walk in the park, stir up a little 
romance and you&#39;ll be fine.&quot; 

The black cat looked like she was going to say something, then changed 
her mind. &quot;Perhaps you just might be right after all, Serena.&quot; She 
turned to look at Ami. &quot;I don&#39;t think one night without studying could 
hurt.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, I get the picture.&quot; Ami stood up and stretched. &quot;Unless you two 
have any other concerns, I&#39;m going to go home and take a nice, hot 
shower.&quot; 

Luna yawned. &quot;Well, I can&#39;t think of anything else except to wish you 
well on your dinner, uh, appointment tomorrow.&quot; 

Serena nodded in agreement. &quot;Same here. Take care, Ami.&quot; 

Ami smiled and waved. &quot;You too,&quot; she said, then turned around and 
left. 

Luna&#39;s posture seemed to droop ever so slightly as she sighed to 
herself. &quot;Just between you and me, Serena, I think there is more to it 
than a mere case of too much studying.&quot; 

&quot;Give it a rest, Luna. Ami can take care of herself and we all have 
our bad days. Just give her boyfriend a chance to relax her and she&#39;ll 
be fine.&quot; She sat back down and picked up her Sailor V game. &quot;Now 
where was I...?&quot; 

Luna just sighed and shook her head. What did I do to deserve this? 
she thought in silence. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ami walked in silence, her mind turned inward to consider several 
possible problems. Could it be that I do spend too much time studying? 
she thought. I know that Serena thinks so, but that&#39;s just Serena. She 
may not be the most brilliant of people but she does have her moments. 
Could this be one of them? 

She continued to think as she walked home, her subconscious 
automatically guiding her footsteps along the route from Serena&#39;s 
house to her own. But her autopilot mode failed to notice the dark 
figure slowly walking up the street and she bumped into him. 

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry about that....&quot; she started to say, but then recognized 
the figure. &quot;Commander Sterling!&quot; 

The Dragoon smiled. &quot;Hello, Ami. Tell me, do you always make it a 
habit of just walking into people?&quot; 

Ami blushed shyly. &quot;No, I was just thinking and I guess I wasn&#39;t 
keeping an eye out where I was going. You okay?&quot; 

&quot;Of course. If I can get knocked over by you without getting scratched 
or bruised, then having you step on my heel is nothing.&quot; 

Ami giggled. &quot;Sorry. What brings you here? This is mostly a 
residential section and I don&#39;t think anything of military interest 
would be around.&quot; 

&quot;Actually, I&#39;m doing a bit of amateur survey work for a friend. He 
wants to build a cathedral around here and I was just looking for a 
good site.&quot; 

Ami thought for a second. &quot;You might want to try up in those hills,&quot; 
she suggested, pointing at a region two miles up the street. &quot;I think 
there once was an old church up there, but I can&#39;t remember for sure.&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s eyebrows arched. &quot;An old church, eh? You know, that just 
might be what my friend was looking for. If he could renovate it, fix 
it up a little bit, it&#39;d save him a whole boatload of trouble and 
money.&quot; He started to laugh to himself. &quot;Why is it every time I run 
into you, you wind up helping me out?&quot; 

Ami blushed and looked down at the street. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Just lucky, 
I guess. If you want, I can stop....&quot; 

&quot;What I want is for tomorrow to get here so I can take you out to 
dinner and properly thank you for all of your help today,&quot; he said 
softly. &quot;Even if there isn&#39;t a church up there, at least you&#39;ve given 
me a starting point.&quot; 

Ami felt her blush deepen by at least two shades and couldn&#39;t think of 
anything to say. Why can&#39;t I find the words to speak? she thought. 
It&#39;s like I&#39;ve forgotten how to talk. 

Tolaris watched with interest as Ami&#39;s cheeks continued to change 
hues. I sure hope they&#39;re supposed to do that, he thought. Maybe it 
would be wise to study human biology as well. I have to admit that the 
color contrasts her blue eyes and hair quite well. 

&quot;You know, if you keep turning colors like that I think you&#39;ll wind up 
hurting something,&quot; he said, and was amazed to see the color deepen 
even more. 

&quot;I can&#39;t quite help it....&quot; she said as her face continued to burn a 
vivid shade of crimson. 

Tolaris chuckled softly. &quot;Hope it doesn&#39;t spread. As I said before, 
blue hair is a rarity and it simply won&#39;t do to lose such natural 
beauty to something like that. I think we have enough redheads as it 
is.&quot; 

Ami swore she could feel the skin being burned off of her face. 
&quot;Tolaris, I have to go,&quot; she managed to say. &quot;I need to study for 
school tomorrow.&quot; 

The Dragoon smiled at her. &quot;Far be it from me to come between a woman 
and her schoolwork. I&#39;ll see you tomorrow in the park at five, Ami. 
Until then, take care and try not to study too much. All work and no 
play makes Ami a very dull girl indeed.&quot; He reached out and took her 
hand. &quot;And I prefer to have a dinner companion who isn&#39;t anywhere near 
dull. See you later,&quot; he said. He kissed her hand before leaving, 
heading in the direction of the hill Ami had pointed out earlier. 

It took Ami several seconds to stop her mind from spinning around in a 
tiny circle. He&#39;s flirting with me, she thought over and over before 
getting a solid grip on reality. She cautiously touched her face and 
was surprised when she didn&#39;t burn her fingers. Why is my face burning 
up? Why can&#39;t I think of anything to say around him? What is it about 
him? Why was he flirting? 

Her mind still slightly off-balance, Ami resumed her walk down the 
street and toward her house. After she got home and had showered, she 
sat down to try to do her studies but found that she simply couldn&#39;t 
focus on her work. She continued to try for half an hour but finally 
gave up and laid down on her bed, her mind still working furiously on 
the problem at hand. 

She spent several hours trying to come up with an answer, any answer, 
to the multitude of questions plaguing her thoughts. But despite her 
efforts, the answers continued to elude her. Why can&#39;t I get him out 
of my mind? was her last conscious thought before her mind slid into 
the world of sleep and dreams. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The wormhole flared into existence and Tolaris stepped through. As 
soon as he was across, the portal collapsed in on itself, leaving no 
trace of it ever existing. It would be easy to get used to this mode 
of travel, he thought to himself. 

&quot;Greetings, Commander,&quot; said a voice behind him and took Tolaris a 
great deal of effort not to jump. He turned around to see the familiar 
figure of General Nephlyte leaning against a wall. &quot;How goes your 
assignment?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve had better, but I&#39;ve had worse.&quot; Tolaris looked around the 
corridor and frowned. &quot;Why am I here instead of where I wanted to go, 
and how did you know I would wind up here at this time?&quot; 

Nephlyte chuckled. &quot;This is one of the military staging areas. We 
didn&#39;t want anyone to be able to just pop in wherever they pleased, so 
we had a few wards put in to redirect the wormholes to certain areas. 
I made an educated guess that you would want to return to your 
quarters to get some sleep before returning to Earth, and this is the 
place the ward would have sent you if you were indeed headed there.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed mentally. &quot;Thank you for the warning,&quot; he said dryly. 
&quot;I take it you wanted to talk to me before I went to sleep?&quot; 

Nephlyte smiled. &quot;I just wanted to see how things were going.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; Tolaris pulled out a small emerald crystal. &quot;Here,&quot; he said 
as he tossed it to the general. &quot;Coordinates of an old church in an 
isolated area of the city. I&#39;ve also made detailed scans of the 
structure and interior in case you want to renovate instead of 
rebuilding.&quot; He pulled out a piece of paper and gave it to the stunned 
Nephlyte. &quot;And this is just something I happened to run across in an 
astrophysics text. Enjoy.&quot; 

Tolaris didn&#39;t bother waiting for the general to say something before 
he left. That should keep him out of my hair for a day or two, he 
thought as he walked down the corridor. He hadn&#39;t gone very far when 
he felt a cool breeze waft down the corridor, bringing with it the 
smell of ky&#39;thra blossoms. 

I don&#39;t need this, Tolaris thought as he turned to face his visitor. 
&quot;So what can I do for you, General Zoisite?&quot; he said in a neutral 
tone. 

The general&#39;s delicate laughter floated down the corridor. &quot;Why, 
Tolaris, what makes you think I would want anything other than to be 
social for a bit? Surely you can appreciate that.&quot; Her ice-blue eyes 
seemed to sparkle as she gave him a little smile. 

The Dragoon frowned, a sense of unease creeping down his spine. 
&quot;Perhaps, but there is a time and place for everything and this isn&#39;t 
either. I&#39;m only here to pick up a few things, then I have to report 
back to my field assignment on Earth.&quot; 

A feigned look of surprise crossed her face. &quot;But I thought you 
weren&#39;t supposed to return to Earth until you&#39;ve gotten some sleep 
first. Or do you want to go see your human girlfriend again?&quot; She 
smiled coldly as Tolaris&#39;s face turned as gray as his blood. 

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he said. His mind worked furiously to come up with 
ways she could have known that and came up with several different 
answers. I think I&#39;m starting to hate this assignment, he thought. I 
was supposed to get away from all of these politics, not thrown into a 
web of them. 

&quot;What I mean is that we know you&#39;ve met up with some girl named Ami, 
that she has helped you with your work, that you find her attractive 
and have made comments on her hair at least twice, and that you&#39;ve 
asked her out for a date tomorrow evening at five. It makes me wonder 
what your real purpose on Earth is, Commander.&quot; 

&quot;It sounds like you&#39;re a bit jealous. Malachite must not be pleasing 
you in bed if you have to pry into other people&#39;s private lives for 
amusement.&quot; He ignored the flash of anger in her eyes and continued. 
&quot;My mission is to study the humans, and interacting with them socially 
is one way of doing so. I can assure you that what I do for recreation 
will not affect my work.&quot; 

&quot;And who&#39;s work might that be, hmm? I understand you&#39;ve been doing a 
bit of work for Nephlyte on the side as well. Perhaps Queen Beryl 
would like to know what else you&#39;ve been doing during your visit to 
Earth.&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. So the truth comes out, he thought. &quot;Nephlyte had 
asked me to look for a place on Earth where he could build a cathedral 
so he could get away from Queen Beryl&#39;s occasional temper. If you 
wish, I could spend some time looking for a suitable love-nest for you 
and Malachite. I&#39;m quite sure it wouldn&#39;t be any trouble.&quot; 

Zoisite gave him a look that was pure venom. &quot;I don&#39;t think that will 
be necessary, Commander, but thank you for offering. Just see that 
your little tryst doesn&#39;t affect your work or Queen Beryl will be most 
displeased.&quot; She was enveloped in a whirlwind of flower petals and 
disappeared. 

The Dragoon focused his mind and a stiff wind was sent down the 
corridor, trying to disperse the smell of ky&#39;thra blossoms. Never 
could quite get used to that smell, he thought darkly. 

&quot;You look like you enjoyed that,&quot; said a voice behind him. 

Tolaris sighed and closed his eyes, wondering what he had done to 
deserve today. &quot;You should know by now that sneaking up behind someone 
is an excellent way of getting hurt or killed,&quot; he said as he turned 
around to glare at his Dragoon friend. 

&quot;Funny,&quot; his friend laughed, his tan eyes gleaming, &quot;I haven&#39;t been 
hurt or killed yet.&quot; 

&quot;Trust me, Maze, that can be arranged quite easily. Now tell me what 
you want before I put you on report for eavesdropping.&quot; 

The Dragoon lieutenant blinked. &quot;Calm down, boss. Unlike that flowery 
ice cube, all I want is to know how you&#39;ve been. Shar-Tei told me you 
were on vacation and I wanted to see if it was true.&quot; He grinned, then 
added, &quot;And if it is, then I&#39;ve just won fifty bucks in a betting 
pool.&quot; 

&quot;I swear I&#39;ll kill her....&quot; Tolaris muttered. &quot;No, I&#39;m not on 
vacation, just on a somewhat unstressful field assignment.&quot; 

Maze smirked. &quot;Yeah, I can see how having a girlfriend can be 
relaxing.&quot; 

Tolaris lashed out, grabbing his friend&#39;s uniform tunic and pinning 
him against the wall. &quot;I don&#39;t know where everyone is getting this 
so-called data, but I want one thing made clear: I don&#39;t, repeat, 
don&#39;t have a girlfriend, nor do I plan on obtaining one in the near 
future,&quot; he hissed. &quot;You are acting on unfounded rumor and that is 
unbecoming of a Dragoon. We are supposed to be the elite intelligence, 
not a grapevine of gossip. Understand?&quot; Maze nodded, his eyes wide. 
&quot;Good,&quot; said Tolaris as he released his grip. &quot;I want you to take this 
to Processing,&quot; he said, giving Maze the amber crystal with the 
photocopies. &quot;Inside is a bunch of basic background information on 
Earth culture and society, plus a bit of research on contemporary 
astrophysics and weather patterns. I want a hard copy of the weather 
stuff for my own use and you can make copies of everything for 
whatever purpose you need. Just make sure Queen Beryl gets a copy.&quot; 

&quot;Sure, boss. Anything classified in here?&quot; 

The Dragoon commander thought for a second. &quot;No, everything can be 
dumped into the general research system. You might want to ask Queen 
Beryl first if there is anything she doesn&#39;t want made public before 
doing the data dump.&quot; 

Maze nodded in understanding. &quot;Too right. Anything else?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing else as far as business goes. I need to get a few personal 
items from my quarters before returning to Earth, but that&#39;s it.&quot; 

&quot;Good,&quot; said the purple-haired Dragoon lieutenant as he pocketed the 
amber crystal. &quot;Just out of idle curiosity, how much free time to you 
have?&quot; 

&quot;Technically until morning, but I still want to poke around the city 
for a while. I want to see what it looks like at night and how the 
citizens behave during that time.&quot; 

Maze coughed lightly. &quot;I see. With all due respect, Commander, perhaps 
you might want to consider taking a bit of a break and unwinding 
tonight. You seem a little tense. You can always study the city 
tomorrow night after your dinner with your human friend.&quot; 

Tolaris eyed his friend suspiciously. &quot;Uh huh. And what exactly did 
you have in mind?&quot; 

Maze grinned. &quot;Well, I happen to know a lovely young Security ensign 
who wouldn&#39;t mind spending some time with you. It seems she also can 
control the weather, though to a lesser degree than you, and wants to 
learn a few tips and tricks about the wind. Said something about 
flight capabilities.&quot; 

That got Tolaris&#39;s attention. &quot;You mean she can fly? How?&quot; 

Maze blinked. &quot;You mean you can&#39;t?&quot; he asked, slightly stunned. 

Tolaris shook his head. &quot;Nope, too heavy. Best I could ever do was 
hover three inches off the ground for about six seconds. But I know 
it&#39;s possible to be able to fly if you&#39;re light enough. In theory,&quot; he 
added. 

&quot;I see. So you want me to arrange a meeting between you two?&quot; 

Tolaris didn&#39;t miss the lecherous gleam in Maze&#39;s tan eyes. &quot;Yes, but 
it will have to wait until I&#39;m finished with this assignment first. 
However, what you can do is give her level six-Aerce access to the 
Dragoon archives, which will let her be able to read my notes 
regarding weather control.&quot; 

Maze arched an eyebrow. &quot;Six-Aerce, huh? Want me to restrict that to a 
certain section of files or just give her the clean sweep?&quot; 

&quot;Restrict it to between DT-WCN/24 and DT-WCN/45. If she can&#39;t find 
what she needs, leave me a note and I&#39;ll search the rest of them 
myself. I think she&#39;ll be find quite enough to help her, though. Oh, 
and Maze?&quot; 

The lieutenant looked up. &quot;Yes, boss?&quot; 

&quot;Quit with the matchmaking. If I ever need a date or whatever, I&#39;m 
quite capable of finding one on my own.&quot; 

Maze was only slightly disappointed. &quot;Of course. Then might I suggest 
a visit from Hospitality?&quot; He caught Tolaris&#39;s dark glare and smiled. 
&quot;I know what you think about Hospitality, so don&#39;t start. They&#39;re not 
all prostitutes, you know, and they perform a wide variety of 
services.&quot; 

&quot;Like what?&quot; muttered Tolaris. 

&quot;Well, I&#39;m no expert but you look like you&#39;re in desperate need of a 
nice massage. It&#39;ll get your mind off of whatever&#39;s eating you and it 
just might improve your disposition to boot.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks, Lieutenant,&quot; the Dragoon commander said dryly. 

Maze smiled. &quot;Anytime. You know, if you&#39;re not really sure about their 
reputation, you could always ask Shar-Tei about it. She worked for 
Hospitality before joining the Dragoons.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;Doing what?&quot; 

&quot;I understand she was a very capable musician, and that she used to 
play meditative music for various patrons when they needed it.&quot; 

Tolaris briefly considered the issue. He usually preferred to avoid 
the rather disreputable branch of the Negaverse military, but the 
thought of a nice massage did have its merits. And if Shar-Tei had 
found the Hospitality branch to be worthy of her skills, then it 
couldn&#39;t be as bad as he imagined. He looked up to find Maze grinning 
at him. &quot;Now what?&quot; he asked with a slight trace of irritation. 

&quot;I can hear the gears turning in your brain. Trust me, Commander, 
you&#39;ll enjoy the experience. I even know who to have them send over. 
All you need is an hour of her attention and you&#39;ll be dead asleep. 
And when you wake up the next morning, you&#39;ll swear you were a new 
person.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed and gave up. &quot;Oh, very well. But have her stop by 
later. I still have some work I need to take care of, and that has to 
be done before I return to Earth.&quot; 

&quot;Right. Think two hours will be enough?&quot; 

&quot;If it isn&#39;t, then I&#39;ve screwed up somewhere along the way. No, two 
hours should be plenty.&quot; He caught the strange look in his friend&#39;s 
eye. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, nothing really. It&#39;s just that we&#39;ve had a betting pool running 
for around half a century on when you would finally let someone from 
Hospitality come within ten feet of you.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed, feeling much older than he really should. &quot;How much 
will you win from this?&quot; he said in a weary tone. 

&quot;More than you really want to know. Two hours, Commander. Talk to you 
later,&quot; he said and walked away. 

&quot;Tell me again why I like my job,&quot; Tolaris said to the empty corridor. 
&quot;I keep forgetting.&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolaris sat back and watched with interest as the weaver ate his 
research crystals. &quot;Hope you enjoy them,&quot; he told it. &quot;It took me 
three hours to get the data in those crystals. You sure you&#39;ll be able 
to replicate the stuff I requested?&quot; 

The giant crystalline spider made a series of high-pitched sounds that 
resembled a set of wind-chimes. It then scuttled off to a corner of 
the room and laid down to thoroughly digest its meal. 

Tolaris nodded. &quot;Right. You can wait until you&#39;ve got everything. Just 
don&#39;t forget I need that stuff by morning, okay?&quot; The weaver chimed 
once, then curled up into a smooth and featureless ball. 

I hope it&#39;s right, he thought to himself. It&#39;s going to be difficult 
to take Ami out to dinner if I don&#39;t have any Earth money. But the 
weaver&#39;s skill at duplicating objects from mere data has never failed 
me before, and I don&#39;t think it will now. 

There was a soft chime at his door. Perfect timing, he thought as he 
got up and opened the door. 

&quot;Commander Tolaris?&quot; inquired the sweet voice of the emerald-haired 
beauty standing on his doorstep. &quot;My name is Solstice. I believe you 
sent for me?&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s eyebrows arched impressively. &quot;If you&#39;re the masseuse from 
the Hospitality division, then yes. Please, come in.&quot; 

She stepped into his quarters holding a medium-sized duffel bag. As 
she made her way into the living room Tolaris cast a quick glance at 
the weaver still curled up in the corner. He frowned slightly as the 
sphere took on a slightly green tint for a second, then returned to 
transparency. He watched as Solstice unpacked a few bottles of various 
colored fluids. She caught his look and smiled. &quot;People tend to react 
differently to assorted oils and creams so I have to bring a wide 
selection. Do you have any kind of skin allergies I should know 
about?&quot; 

&quot;Aside to the usual poisons and toxins, nothing I&#39;m aware of.&quot; 

She shot him a strange look and continued to unpack. The Dragoon 
casually made his way across the room to stand next to the dormant 
weaver. Making sure Solstice couldn&#39;t see the movement, he tapped out 
a pattern on the weaver&#39;s carapace. He then moved to sit in a nearby 
chair. 

Solstice was almost finished unpacking when the weaver suddenly turned 
a deep shade of purple. Tolaris sighed and stood up. &quot;I don&#39;t think 
you&#39;ll be a very effective spy tonight, Solstice.&quot; 

The emerald-haired masseuse dropped a bottle of oil in surprise and 
shock. &quot;What?&quot; she said, her dark green eyes going wide. &quot;How.... how 
did you know?&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Well, you didn&#39;t bring any scanners or recorders in 
with you when you came in, so that only left two options: You&#39;re 
either a telepath with excellent memory skills or you&#39;re just an 
ordinary Hospitality worker. My home security system has just 
confirmed that you are indeed a telepath, and Hospitality policy is to 
exclude telepaths from their division. Hence, all it leaves us with is 
a spy posed as a Hospitality worker.&quot; 

Solstice looked like she was about to cry. &quot;Please, Commander, believe 
me when I say I didn&#39;t want to do this. I was approached by my 
superiors and told that I had to do this job because I was the only 
one qualified.&quot; 

Tolaris smiled gently. &quot;Of course. I would guess that there aren&#39;t too 
many beautiful young telepaths out there with photographic memories as 
well as massage skills. Correct?&quot; 

She nodded her head. &quot;They said you were good but that you shouldn&#39;t 
be able to tell if a person was telepathic or not. Nothing was said 
about a home security system.&quot; 

&quot;Actually, I wouldn&#39;t know a telepath if she walked up and tried to 
fry my brain. Come over here and try to read my thoughts.&quot; 

Solstice walked over and sat next to him. She lightly brushed his 
forehead with her fingers as she tried to probe his mind. Seconds 
later, her eyes widened in surprise. &quot;You&#39;re psi-mute!&quot; she exclaimed. 

Tolaris nodded his head. &quot;Exactly. The part of my brain that telepaths 
make contact with never quite developed so I&#39;m immune to all mental 
forms of psionics.&quot; 

She nodded. &quot;So my skills are useless and now my cover has been blown. 
I guess it won&#39;t be long now before I&#39;m disposed of, right?&quot; 

Tolaris merely chuckled. &quot;Maybe not. Here&#39;s how it&#39;ll happen: I never 
found out you were a telepath. You tried to do what you were supposed 
to but couldn&#39;t since I&#39;m psi-mute. No one knows I know about you and 
your mission fails due to circumstances totally beyond your control 
and through no fault of your own. They shrug and let you go, and life 
goes on.&quot; 

Solstice smiled at the Dragoon. &quot;When they said you were the master of 
military intelligence, they weren&#39;t kidding.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;No big deal. Anyway, you might as get comfortable 
for a while. It would be suspicious if you left here before you were 
supposed to have finished with me.&quot; 

The telepath laughed softly. &quot;Well, if you put it that way, might as 
well go ahead with the massage. Just because I can&#39;t do the one job 
doesn&#39;t mean I can&#39;t do the other....&quot; 

Tolaris laughed and allowed himself to be led over to his bed. He 
removed his uniform tunic and laid down like he was asked as Solstice 
reached out and grabbed a bottle of oil. She opened it and was about 
to start working when she noticed Tolaris making a face. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;Please, anything but ky&#39;thra blossoms. I&#39;ve started to develop a 
dislike for the stuff quite recently.&quot; 

Solstice shrugged and picked through her collection of oils and 
creams. &quot;You mind smelling like kath petals for a while?&quot; 

&quot;As long as it doesn&#39;t remind me of anyone I hate.&quot; 

Solstice smiled. &quot;Right....&quot; she said, then went to work. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Serena was sitting by the lakeside gazing wistfully up at the stars. I 
wish he would come here with me, she thought. It would be so 
romantic.... She blinked in surprise as a red rose was placed in her 
lap. Startled, she looked up only to find the gently smiling face of 
Tuxedo Mask. 

&quot;Be careful what you wish for, you just might get it,&quot; he said softly. 

She smiled as she was helped up. &quot;Tuxedo Mask, you heard my thoughts?&quot; 

He laughed quietly. &quot;It&#39;s not hard to hear what your heart is saying, 
my beloved Serena.&quot; 

She blushed. &quot;Then you know how I feel for you....&quot; 

He took her hand in his and drew her close. &quot;Which is exactly how I 
feel for you, my love.&quot; 

&quot;So you do love me....&quot; she said in a dreamy tone. 

&quot;I always have, Serena, and I always will,&quot; he said as he bent his 
head down to kiss her.... And the world exploded into reality as the 
alarm clock on Serena&#39;s night stand went off. She reached out to throw 
it across the room but only succeeded in tossing a surprised and 
sleepy Luna off of the bed. 

&quot;Serena!&quot; the cat said as she got up off of the floor. &quot;Come on, get 
up! It&#39;s time for school, and if you don&#39;t move now you&#39;ll be late 
again!&quot; 

&quot;Just another few more minutes....&quot; Serena muttered as she rolled 
over. 

&quot;But that&#39;s what you said twenty minutes ago when your alarm went off 
the first time,&quot; Luna protested. &quot;It&#39;s seven-fifty!&quot; 

That got Serena&#39;s attention. &quot;What time is it?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ve got ten minutes to get to class or it&#39;s detention time again!&quot; 

Serena bolted out of bed. &quot;Ten minutes?! WAAAAHHHH, I&#39;ll be late!&quot; she 
cried and dashed into the bathroom. 

Luna chuckled to herself. It may only be seven-thirty, she thought, 
but as long as Serena thinks she&#39;ll be late she won&#39;t waste any time. 
I just hope she doesn&#39;t catch on until she gets to school. 

She heard the doorbell ring and her whiskers started to droop. Oh, no, 
she thought, don&#39;t let that be Ami here to walk to school with Serena. 

&quot;Hi, Mrs. Tsukino. Is Serena up yet?&quot; came the familiar voice. 

Just then, Serena dashed out of the bathroom wearing her school 
uniform. She quickly grabbed her school books and ran out the door, 
almost running Luna over in her haste. 

&quot;Comeonwe&#39;relatewegottago!&quot; she said as she grabbed Ami&#39;s arm and took 
off running. Her arm was almost yanked out of its socket as Ami 
refused to budge. 

&quot;Serena, what are you talking about? We&#39;ve got almost a full half-hour 
to get to class. What&#39;s your hurry?&quot; 

Serena blinked, her pulse still racing. &quot;We&#39;re not late?&quot; she asked. 
It sank in a few seconds later and she turned around to fix Luna with 
a deadly glare. &quot;I&#39;m not late?&quot; she said in a dangerously soft tone. 

Luna smiled weakly and started to backpedal. Ami just laughed and 
patted her friend on the back. &quot;Well, at least you won&#39;t be if you get 
going.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll deal with you later,&quot; Serena promised her cat. 

Ami laughed. &quot;Come on, Serena, let&#39;s go.&quot; 

The two walked toward the school in relative silence, Serena being too 
upset to talk and Ami not in the mood for idle chatter. They hadn&#39;t 
gotten far when they felt another icy wind blow through them. They 
exchanged looks before Ami pulled out her computer to search for the 
source of the disturbance. 

&quot;Up there,&quot; she pointed to the nearby hills. &quot;I&#39;m picking up a strange 
life reading, probably a Negaverse monster.&quot; 

Serena groaned. &quot;Not another one. I&#39;m really starting to hate this.&quot; 

Ami looked about to make sure no one was around. &quot;We&#39;ll have to 
discuss this later. Ready?&quot; 

Serena nodded her head glumly. &quot;Yeah, let&#39;s get this one over with.&quot; 
She held up her hand. &quot;Moon Prism Power!&quot; she yelled. 

Ami held up her silvery wand. &quot;Mercury Power!&quot; she said loudly, and 
the two of them were transformed into the Sailor Scouts. Together they 
ran up the street toward the site of the disturbance. 

&quot;I don&#39;t.... see how you.... can type.... like that.... when 
you&#39;re.... running....&quot; Sailor Moon puffed as the road&#39;s angle grew 
steeper. 

&quot;It&#39;s easier than.... you would think....&quot; Mercury said, steadying her 
computer with one hand and poking at it with the other. The computer 
beeped loudly and Sailor Mercury made a sharp right turn onto a dirt 
road. The move caught Sailor Moon by surprise and she overshot the 
road before she stopped and backtracked. 

&quot;I don&#39;t get it,&quot; Sailor Moon said, still out of breath. &quot;Why are we 
in the middle of nowhere if the Negaverse is looking for energy? You 
would think that they&#39;d be some place populated.&quot; 

Without any sort of warning a dense fog bank sprang up and enveloped 
the two Sailor Scouts. Mercury immediately crouched down and started 
typing away furiously at her computer. She made a motion and Sailor 
Moon quickly crouched down as well. 

&quot;One of your bubbles get away from you?&quot; Sailor Moon whispered. 

Mercury shook her head. &quot;Not my doing,&quot; she whispered back. &quot;My 
computer reads this as natural, but you saw how sudden it appeared.&quot; 
She touched one of her earrings and a band of blue light formed over 
her eyes. A second later it solidified into her Virtual Visor. She 
poked at her computer some more and various readouts appeared on her 
visor. 

&quot;I&#39;ve got one bio-reading but I can&#39;t pinpoint it due to this fog. My 
best guess is that it&#39;s anywhere between twenty and fifty feet over 
there,&quot; she said as she pointed toward a barely visible grove of 
trees. 

&quot;You might want to check again....&quot; Sailor Moon said, her voice 
starting to waver with a strange emotion. 

Mercury glanced over at Sailor Moon to see what was wrong. An eerie 
cold washed over her as she watched the blood drain out of Sailor 
Moon&#39;s face, her wide eyes staring at something above Mercury&#39;s head. 
Mercury turned to look, then immediately wished she hadn&#39;t. 

The only thing Mercury could think of was that they were probably in a 
lot of trouble right now. The beast was the size of a large dog, 
hovering in place on a pair of gauzy wings. Its cold blue eyes seemed 
to bore straight through them as it hissed quietly. Its claws flexed 
as it lashed its reptilian tail back and forth, creating odd currents 
in the fog. 

Mist dragon, thought Mercury. Her computer automatically relayed its 
analysis to her visor, overlaying what she saw with words and symbols. 
Okay, she thought in a panic, now that we&#39;ve found what we&#39;re looking 
for, now what? 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

So now what? thought Tolaris as he sat in a tree, watching the two 
Sailor Scouts deal with the phantasm. It looks like a real mist 
dragon, it sounds real, it even smells real, so now what are you going 
to do about it? 

The Dragoon suppressed the urge to yawn. I really didn&#39;t want to get 
up this early, he thought, but this was probably the best time to 
catch these two off-guard. His train of thought vanished as he watched 
one of them touch her ear, causing a strange light to form over her 
eyes. I don&#39;t like this, the Dragoon thought with a frown. What is she 
up to? 

He held out his own crystal scanner and didn&#39;t like what it reported. 
A tactical computer, eh? So that one must be Sailor Mercury. 
Wonderful. So now she has a tactical computer as well as an analytical 
one. I seriously hope she doesn&#39;t find the holographic crystal before 
I can get a full scan on them. He took a closer look at her and 
blinked in surprise. Another blue-haired one, eh? So perhaps they&#39;re 
not quite as rare as I thought. 

He watched with dismay as Mercury turned her head to her left to look 
at something. She said something to the other Sailor Scout, then 
darted off. The mist dragon hologram turned to follow Mercury and the 
other one stood up and shouted out a warning. The Dragoon&#39;s eyes lit 
up as he watched her remove her tiara and drop into a combat stance. 

Maybe this won&#39;t be a wasted trip after all, he thought as he held out 
his crystal scanner. The tiara started to glow with a strange light as 
it melted and reformed into a flat disc. The Dragoon smiled as 
information raced across the crystal&#39;s display and was recorded into 
its memory. Now throw it, my dear, and let me get the data. Better 
yet, throw it at the phantasm and watch as it passes right through and 
hits your friend instead. 

His smile faded as Mercury came to a halt and brought her foot down 
hard on something. The sound of shattering crystal echoed through the 
area as the holographic mist dragon vanished. Tolaris sighed and 
dissipated his fog bank. This is just lovely, he thought as the second 
Sailor Scout reversed her tiara&#39;s transformation. Well, at least I&#39;ve 
gotten scans of that tiara and of Sailor Mercury&#39;s boot. I guess it&#39;s 
better than nothing. 

The crystal beeped a warning and Tolaris didn&#39;t need to glance at it 
to know that someone was trying to scan him. Sorry, girls, not 
happening. He concentrated on the Silkworm crystal and a wormhole 
flared into existence in front of him. He leapt through it and onto 
the street beyond, almost falling as he landed wrong. The wormhole 
flared once more before it collapsed behind him. 

He sighed softly and looked around. &quot;At least I didn&#39;t manage to get 
lost this morning,&quot; he said as he saw the library across the street. 
He stepped out of the alley and frowned, sniffing the air cautiously. 
Smells like a storm, he thought as he scanned the sky for the 
tell-tale gray clouds. 

The clouds were farther away than he had expected, but they were 
certainly storm clouds. Much as I like storms, he thought, I don&#39;t 
want a sudden rain to spoil an evening walk in the park. He 
concentrated briefly and a subtle low pressure system formed above the 
city. The system would keep the storm front away from the city until 
well past nightfall, giving Tolaris enough time to enjoy his evening 
with Ami. 

His train of thought switched tracks, thinking about Ami instead. Now 
why do I have a bit of difficulty getting her out of my mind? he 
wondered as he crossed the street and entered the library. He briefly 
noted with amusement that a pair of maintenance workers were still 
working on putting the heavy door back on its newly replaced hinges. 

He collected several books and sat down in a remote corner of the 
study lounge. He tried to focus on the material but his mind kept 
wandering back to Ami. He put the biology text down on the table and 
sighed. That&#39;s it, I give up. Just what is it about her? She is quite 
beautiful, but she is way too young. Or am I just too old? 

The Dragoon sat up as a new line of thought occurred to him. Could 
that be it? Could it be I&#39;ve spent too much of my life dedicated to my 
duty, and that I now find myself wanting some company? Wanting 
someone&#39;s attentions? He sat back and laughed quietly. Come on, 
Commander, you&#39;re over seven hundred and she&#39;s probably not even 
sixteen. Physically. 

He sat up again as a third set of thoughts came to him. It is proven 
that physical and mental ages can vary by several years. Of course, 
I&#39;m physically seven hundred and twenty-four, and mentally I&#39;m pushing 
two thousand, but Ami seems to be mentally older than she looks. Could 
it be that I find myself attracted to her because she&#39;s older than she 
seems? 

Am I even attracted to her? he thought briefly, but the answer was 
almost obvious. Probably. I guess the real reason I invited her out to 
dinner was so that I could spend more time with her. And there&#39;s the 
matter of the storm I delayed. I did it so our walk wouldn&#39;t be 
interrupted. 

Tolaris sat back as several trains of thought ran through his head. He 
never could answer all of the questions, but he realized that it 
boiled down to a set of very simple facts: He liked Ami, he didn&#39;t 
know why, and he really didn&#39;t care why. Sounds like I&#39;m going to have 
a few ideas to bounce off of Maze when I get back, if I can get him to 
keep his mouth shut about it. 

With his mind calmed down, Tolaris reached out and picked up the 
biology book once again. He had almost finished with the section 
regarding blushing and related responses when a single thought popped 
up from his subconscious. The nature of the thought was so startling 
that he almost dropped the book. Why didn&#39;t I think of it before? he 
thought. What happened to that third Sailor Scout I heard yesterday? 
Why didn&#39;t she come with the others? 

The Dragoon sighed darkly and sat back to contemplate his new line of 
questioning, all thoughts of Ami and biology forgotten. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Ms. Haruna glanced up from her desk just in time to catch Serena 
trying to quietly sneak into class. She sighed darkly as she stood up 
and grabbed the prepared detention form off of her desk. Why am I not 
surprised? she thought to herself. 

&quot;Well, Ms. Tsukino, so nice of you to join us. Do you realize that 
this is the fifth time this month that you&#39;ve been late to class?&quot; 

Serena silently nodded as she held her hand out to receive the 
detention form. She was late to class at least once a week, so the 
routine was quite familiar to her. She signed the form, kept the 
bottom copy, and took her seat in the middle of the room. 

Ms. Haruna glared at her before turning back to her class. &quot;Okay, now 
as I was saying....&quot; She trailed off as she saw Ami meekly walk into 
the room, wearing the same expression Serena did. &quot;Ms. Mizuno...?&quot; she 
said slowly. 

Ami nodded glumly. &quot;Sorry I&#39;m late, Ms. Haruna. I, uh, was rather busy 
this morning and wasn&#39;t watching the time.&quot; 

A minor shockwave rippled through the class. Ami&#39;s punctuality was 
almost legendary, and for her to be tardy to class without a serious 
medical reason or legitimate excuse was simply unheard of. 

The teacher blinked in concern. &quot;Are you feeling okay, Ms. Mizuno? Are 
you sick or anything?&quot; 

&quot;No, I&#39;m fine. I was just sidetracked, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

&quot;I see. Well, take your seat and please don&#39;t let it happen again.&quot; 
She turned back to the class. &quot;Now, as I was saying, everyone please 
get out your homework assignment from Friday.&quot; 

She made her way up and down the rows of desk, marking in her grade 
book who had their homework completed and who didn&#39;t. She came to a 
dead stop and almost dropped the book when she came to Serena. 

Serena looked up in confusion. &quot;What? I did my homework. See?&quot; she 
said as she held out the completed assignment. 

Ms. Haruna&#39;s hand shook as she examined the paper. &quot;You actually sat 
down and did the homework?&quot; she said, her eyes going wide in shock. 
This time a major shockwave ran through the room. Serena&#39;s habit of 
waiting until the last minute to do her homework was nearly as 
legendary as Ami&#39;s punctuality. 

The teacher walked over to her desk and set her grade book down. &quot;I&#39;ll 
be back in a few minutes, class,&quot; she said and left the room. Almost 
immediately the classroom started to buzz with rumors as to why she 
left. 

Serena&#39;s friend Molly stood up and walked over. &quot;Boy, Serena, I think 
you really blew her mind this time. You really did your homework?&quot; 

&quot;Actually, yes. I did it late Sunday night, but I did it.&quot; 

&quot;What a real mind-bender. I&#39;ll bet having Ami late for class didn&#39;t 
help Ms. Haruna either.&quot; The two of then looked over to Ami and were 
surprised to see that she wasn&#39;t spending the free time reading. 
Instead, she was staring at her desk with a glum look on her face. 

Serena stood up and was about to walk over to Ami when Melvin popped 
up with a grin on his face. &quot;Hey, guess what? Ms. Haruna is outside 
smoking a cigarette!&quot; 

&quot;What? You&#39;re kidding,&quot; the blonde said, amazed. 

&quot;No joke. I can&#39;t tell from up here, but it looks like it&#39;s 
unfiltered. I think you really did it this time, Serena.&quot; 

Molly got up and moved over to the window. &quot;He&#39;s not lying, Serena. 
Ms. Haruna is standing underneath the tree, puffing away like a 
dragon. Who would have thought it?&quot; She shook her head in wonder, 
looked out the window, then dashed back to her seat. &quot;Quick, everyone, 
here she comes!&quot; 

There was a brief scramble as everyone dove for their seats. Ms. 
Haruna walked in a few seconds later, picked up her grade book, and 
continued to check the homework papers as if nothing had happened. She 
finished, then returned to the front of the room. 

&quot;Okay, everyone, take out your math book and turn to chapter twelve, 
page two-thirteen. We will start today with second and third-degree 
polynomial equations. If you will note, multiplying or dividing the 
sides of an equation by a non-zero number gives us a new, correct 
equation....&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Serena was sitting beneath the tree contentedly munching on the 
remains of her lunch when an inky black shape silently dropped out of 
the branches and into her lap. Before Serena could scream in surprise 
and fear, the cat reached up and laid a paw across her lips. 

&quot;Serena, it&#39;s me,&quot; Luna whispered as she spat out a feather. &quot;Calm 
down. I didn&#39;t quite intend to land in your lap like that.&quot; 

&quot;Luna, you almost gave me a heart attack!&quot; the blonde said. &quot;Umm, why 
are you here at school? Is something the matter?&quot; 

Luna nodded her head. &quot;Shortly after you and Ami left for school, I 
felt the Negaverse nearby. I think they&#39;re up to something again.&quot; 

&quot;We already dealt with it this morning,&quot; said Ami as she quietly sat 
next to Serena. &quot;I don&#39;t know what they were doing, but I didn&#39;t like 
it one bit.&quot; 

The black cat waited patiently as Ami recounted the events that took 
place up in the hills earlier that day. Luna was mildly surprised when 
Serena stayed quiet throughout the recollection. &quot;Serena, you&#39;re 
awfully quiet about this. Is something wrong?&quot; 

&quot;No, it&#39;s just that I was late to school because of that stupid trap 
and now I&#39;ve got another detention after class. This is really 
starting to annoy me, especially since someone made me get up early 
just so I wouldn&#39;t be late.&quot; 

Luna sighed. This wasn&#39;t the first time Serena had complained about 
her destiny and she was quite sure it wouldn&#39;t be the last. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry, Serena, but it&#39;s your destiny to be Sailor Moon, and being late 
to school is just one of the small prices to pay to stop the Negaverse 
from conquering Earth.&quot; 

&quot;But I didn&#39;t ask to be Sailor Moon!&quot; she wailed. 

Ami smiled and gently laid her hand on Serena&#39;s shoulder. &quot;You should 
try to look at it this way: At least you get to kick the Negaverse&#39;s 
butt. All I can do is analyze whatever they throw at us and blow 
bubbles. I can&#39;t destroy the monsters like you can. I simply don&#39;t 
have the power.&quot; 

Serena looked up and smiled. &quot;Well, you do have a point. I guess being 
Sailor Moon isn&#39;t that bad after all. But still, I hate being late 
because of the Negaverse.&quot; 

&quot;Once we find the Moon Princess and defeat Queen Beryl once and for 
all, then you can go back to being an ordinary school girl,&quot; said 
Luna. &quot;So maybe if you concentrated on your mission a little more, we 
could find her and get this over with as soon as possible.&quot; 

Serena nodded her head. &quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; 

Ami giggled. &quot;Besides, if you weren&#39;t Sailor Moon then you would never 
have met Tuxedo Mask. How&#39;s that for incentive?&quot; 

The blonde&#39;s eyes went starry as she thought of Tuxedo Mask and Luna 
just sighed again. &quot;There she goes again, off into her fantasy dream 
world.&quot; The cat blinked as a thought occurred to her. &quot;Why didn&#39;t 
Tuxedo Mask show up to give you girls a hand this morning? He usually 
does when Sailor Moon is in danger.&quot; 

&quot;Probably because we had everything under control,&quot; Serena said, still 
thinking of Tuxedo Mask. &quot;It was a piece of cake to deal with that 
illusion.&quot; 

Ami made a face. &quot;Knock it off, Serena. I&#39;m the one who stepped on the 
crystal generating the illusion and you almost threw your tiara at me 
for my efforts. What I&#39;m more concerned about is that strange 
bio-reading I got. It vanished before I could get a definite reading 
on it, but I think it could have matched the one I got in the 
library.&quot; 

Serena blinked and focused on reality. &quot;Ami, are you sure your 
computer isn&#39;t on the fritz? The fog was part of the illusion yet your 
computer read it as natural.&quot; 

Her blue-haired friend shook her head. &quot;No, the fog was real. If you 
remember, it didn&#39;t disappear until after the crystal had been 
destroyed and the dragon illusion vanished. I can&#39;t explain what it 
was, but the fog was definitely real.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t like this,&quot; Luna said slowly. &quot;First it&#39;s a simple trap 
that&#39;s disarmed with a mere touch, now a simple holographic illusion. 
And plus we have a strange bio-reading at both sites. This simply 
doesn&#39;t feel like the Negaverse&#39;s usual tricks and traps.&quot; 

&quot;I told you before, we&#39;re just getting too good for those guys,&quot; 
Serena said with a smile. 

Luna sighed heavily, feeling the weight of her years bearing down on 
her. Why me? Why her? she thought. &quot;Serena, I seriously doubt that&#39;s 
the case.&quot; 

Ami abruptly stood up. &quot;I hate to interrupt you two, but we&#39;ll have to 
talk about this later. Come on, Serena, class is almost about to start 
and we don&#39;t want to be late again.&quot; 

Serena made a face as she got up. &quot;You got that right,&quot; she muttered 
to no one in particular. She then turned to Luna. &quot;I guess I&#39;ll see 
you after detention, Luna.&quot; 

Luna nodded. &quot;Looks that way. Take care, you two,&quot; she said, then 
leapt back into the tree. 

&quot;What is she doing in the tree?&quot; Ami inquired as they went back into 
the school building. 

&quot;Just because our lunch is over doesn&#39;t mean hers is.&quot; 

&quot;I see....&quot; 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Commander?&quot; said the polite voice. 

Tolaris looked up from his work. The voice belonged to a dark-skinned 
ensign from the Security division. Tolaris frowned in concern, 
wondering why she was sent to find him. 

&quot;How can I help you, Ensign...?&quot; he said cautiously. 

She smiled. &quot;Ensign Tempest, sir. It seems that your presence has 
been, shall we say, requested back at the, uh, base.&quot; 

The Dragoon&#39;s frown deepened as several thoughts occurred to him. This 
is not good, he thought. I&#39;m not due to report to Queen Beryl for 
another eleven Earth hours, so something must be wrong. 

&quot;Very well, Ensign, lead on,&quot; he said, gesturing for her to take the 
lead. She casually made her way out of the building with Tolaris in 
tow, the Dragoon still frowning. 

&quot;Perhaps you might not want to look like you ate a live rakketh, sir. 
It might make some people suspicious,&quot; the willowy ensign suggested. 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;Sorry, Ensign. I&#39;m just concerned that something 
must be wrong if I&#39;m needed. I wasn&#39;t due to check in until well past 
nightfall.&quot; 

A sudden wind sprang up, causing Tempest&#39;s mane of snow-white hair to 
whip about wildly. She nodded her head fractionally and turned down a 
narrow alley. Tolaris followed, but halted when she stopped suddenly 
and turned around to face him. 

&quot;I understand Queen Beryl is in a foul mood about something,&quot; she said 
as she handed him a piece of paper. He was about to say something when 
she laid a finger across her lips. Tolaris understood and silently 
read the note. 

&quot;Shar-Tei has reason to believe that you&#39;re being monitored somehow. 
She can&#39;t quite figure out how, but her intelligence shows that 
Zoisite has been feeding Beryl info about your activities on Earth, 
including about your social plans with the human girl. Suggestion that 
you watch yourself and assume that anything you say or hear is being 
monitored. - Maze&quot; 

&quot;Any idea what it could be this time?&quot; Tolaris asked his escort as he 
read the message again. Oh, this is just perfect. I hate politics. Ten 
bucks says Zoisite&#39;s ticked about my dinner date and told Beryl about 
it to light a fire under my butt. 

&quot;No clue, sir. Might as well find out for yourself.&quot; She reached into 
a pocket and pulled out a very familiar crystal. 

Tolaris&#39;s eyebrows shot up. &quot;Ensign, isn&#39;t that the Silkworm crystal 
that the Dragoon division is supposed to have in its possession? And 
if so, why is it that someone from Security is using it?&quot; 

Tempest smiled. &quot;Yes it is, and I happened to have been talking to 
your Lieutenant Maze when word came down that you were needed. I 
volunteered for the job and was given temporary use of the crystal.&quot; 

The Dragoon smiled as a puzzle piece fell into place. &quot;I see.... 
You&#39;re the Security ensign who can control the weather, right?&quot; 

Tempest blushed slightly. &quot;Well, yes. I had wanted to meet you for 
some time now and this seemed like a good opportunity to do so. Oh, 
and thank you for the computer files on weather control. They&#39;ve 
proven to be quite useful.&quot; 

&quot;My pleasure. Ensign. We weather elementalists have to stick together, 
seeing how there&#39;s so few of us. There&#39;s what, four of us?&quot; 

&quot;Five, actually, but the one is only forty years old and still 
learning to control her powers.&quot; 

&quot;Great. When you get back, would you ask Security to get me a copy of 
any records we have on her? I wouldn&#39;t mind teaching her if she needs 
any help.&quot; 

&quot;No problem, Commander,&quot; she said as she activated the Silkworm 
crystal. A wormhole flared into existence in the alley. The ensign 
made a gesture and Tolaris stepped through, into the main audience 
chamber of Queen Beryl. 

The Dragoon bowed to Beryl as Tempest stepped through the wormhole. 
The vortex collapsed and she handed the Silkworm crystal to Lieutenant 
Maze. Maze smiled and whispered a quick thank-you. 

&quot;Thank you, Ensign Tempest,&quot; said Queen Beryl from her throne. &quot;You 
are dismissed.&quot; The Security officer bowed to Beryl and left the room. 
Maze gave Tolaris a meaningful look and Tolaris nodded briefly. He 
then stepped forward to speak with Beryl. 

&quot;I understand you wanted to see me, my Queen,&quot; he said. 

The dark queen smiled. &quot;It has been brought to my attention that you 
are starting to show signs of inattention to your mission objectives. 
I wanted to talk to you to see what exactly is going on with you and 
your mission.&quot; 

Tolaris frowned. &quot;I am not aware of any such inattention. Perhaps if 
you could tell me what you mean, I might be able to explain.&quot; 

&quot;I understand that you have spent a rather substantial portion of your 
time socializing with a young human girl and that you are starting to 
display signs of romantic involvement.&quot; 

A cold wind blew through Tolaris. Sometimes I hate being right about 
some things, he thought. &quot;My Queen, part of my studies involves 
socialization with the humans to learn more about their culture. This 
particular girl has helped me, on several occasions, with my studies 
about Earth. Part of my cover as a native is to behave like one, and 
one such act is the repayment of a favor with a social event.&quot; 

Beryl looked mildly amused. &quot;And you are repaying the favor by 
becoming romantically involved with her?&quot; 

The Dragoon had to laugh. &quot;No, my Queen, I am merely repaying the 
favor by taking her out to dinner. As you will see in my report, this 
is considered an acceptable form of repayment. I take it you haven&#39;t 
seen my notes yet?&quot; Queen Beryl shook her head and Tolaris turned 
around to glare at Maze. The Dragoon lieutenant had the grace to look 
embarrassed and quickly left to obtain the notes from Processing. He 
turned back around to find Beryl giving him a strange look. 

&quot;I understand, however, that taking a person out to a meal is often 
seen as a romantic gesture, sometimes suggesting a desire for romantic 
involvement,&quot; said the dark queen. 

Tolaris mentally winced. &quot;That much is true, my Queen, but I have no 
such sentiments with regard to the human girl.&quot; 

&quot;I would hope so, Commander.&quot; Beryl sat back and laughed softly. &quot;I 
have a slight difficulty imagining that someone who has shunned such 
romance for seven centuries would suddenly turn to a mere child for a 
relationship.&quot; She sat up and a strange look crossed her face. 

&quot;However,&quot; she continued, &quot;I have seen stranger things in my time. 
Maybe you don&#39;t have any such intentions, but I warn you that I will 
not tolerate any interference in your mission. Make sure this.... 
relationship doesn&#39;t affect your mission, Commander, or I assure you 
the penalties will be quite harsh.&quot; 

&quot;Understood,&quot; Tolaris said simply. 

Beryl sat back once again. &quot;Now then, if you don&#39;t mind I&#39;d like to 
hear a brief verbal report on your current progress with the mission.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed softly. &quot;I&#39;m afraid that I&#39;ve managed to underestimate 
the Sailor Scout&#39;s resources. During my first encounter with them, I 
learned that the one called Sailor Mercury possesses an analytical 
computer with a rather surprising range of capabilities. Not only was 
she able to detect the simple nature of the energy crystal, she also 
managed to get a partial reading on my life-signs. Fortunately she 
failed to get a second reading once the crystal was destroyed. 

&quot;Also during that encounter, I heard three voices instead of the 
expected two and I believe that there is a third Sailor Scout working 
with them. Due to the nature of my camouflage, if you will, I was 
unable to view them as they dealt with the energy crystal. Due to 
error on my part, I didn&#39;t think of trying to get a voice reading on 
them.&quot; 

Beryl gave him a reproving look. &quot;Commander Tolaris, I&#39;m surprised 
that you would overlook something like that. However, at least you 
have the courage to admit that the fault was yours. I don&#39;t believe 
I&#39;ve ever gotten such a confession out of Jedyt. Still, such 
underestimations are rather disturbing.&quot; 

&quot;I am currently in the process of rectifying those oversights now. 
During the second encounter with them, I was able to obtain visual 
readings on two of the Sailor Scouts as well as some readings on 
Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara-weapon and on Sailor Mercury&#39;s boot.&quot; 

Beryl looked surprised. &quot;Sailor Mercury&#39;s boot?&quot; she echoed. 

Tolaris allowed himself to smile. &quot;That was unintentional. I had used 
a holographic projector crystal to simulate a mist dragon. Sailor 
Mercury used a tactical computer to locate the crystal and then 
stomped on it. The crystal was programmed to do a thorough scan on 
whatever deactivated it, which happened to be her left boot.&quot; 

&quot;Were I not distressed by your lack of useful information, Commander, 
I would be highly amused at that. What is your plan for your next 
encounter with those Sailor Scouts?&quot; 

Tolaris frowned slightly. &quot;I don&#39;t have a plan in mind yet, my Queen. 
I am still rather occupied with my research regarding human society 
and culture. It is quite involving and I don&#39;t believe I could be 
ready to lay another trap for the Sailor Scouts for some time.&quot; 

Beryl&#39;s red eyes narrowed. &quot;Then perhaps you should not be spending 
too much of your time with that human girl,&quot; she suggested darkly. 

&quot;I believe that would be unwise. Much of the information I have 
gathered in my research notes has been with her help, without which I 
would probably still be researching even now. Plus, dealing with her 
has given me several new insights into the human society and culture. 
Granted I won&#39;t be spending much time with her, but she is an 
invaluable resource to me.&quot; 

The dark queen was silent for several seconds. &quot;Even though I am 
highly displeased with your lack of progress,&quot; she said at length, &quot;I 
will allow you to continue with your mission. Be warned, however, that 
should you let your social research interfere with your mission, the 
consequences will be very severe and exacting. Dismissed.&quot; 

Tolaris bowed to Beryl, then silently left the chamber. I&#39;m starting 
to hate this assignment more and more with each passing hour, he 
thought. This was supposed to be an easy assignment, not one of the 
worst ones of my entire Dragoon career. I think I need a quick nap 
before my dinner date with Ami. 

He stopped in the corridor as an idea occurred to him. Perhaps I need 
something better than a nap. He smiled, then walked in the general 
direction of the main Hospitality division building. Maybe I can find 
out if Solstice is still somewhere around here. I could use another 
nice massage.... 

Still smiling to himself, he walked down the corridor and into the one 
building in the Negaverse military he had avoided with a passion for 
over five hundred years. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolaris wearily sat behind his desk, feeling every bit as old as he 
was. That&#39;s it, he thought, when this assignment is over, I think I&#39;m 
going to need a vacation. He read through the report once more then 
sighed. 

&quot;What&#39;s Hospitality got to say about this?&quot; he asked Maze. 

The purple-haired Dragoon paced back and forth. &quot;Not much. Solstice 
was never a part of Hospitality, so they don&#39;t have any information on 
her and they don&#39;t care who she was. As far as they&#39;re concerned, my 
request for a masseuse for you got lost in a paper shuffle and no one 
ever visited you.&quot; 

&quot;Right,&quot; snorted Tolaris. He tossed the report back on his desk. &quot;So 
now all we&#39;ve got is one dead spy and a lot of unanswered questions. 
Do we even know what division she worked for?&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;Not even that. None of the record traces I&#39;ve 
done has come up with anything, and I mean nothing. No name, no 
registration code, not even a fingerprint match. It&#39;s as if she never 
existed until they found her stuffed in a mailbox.&quot; 

Tolaris made a face. &quot;Thank you for reminding me, Lieutenant.&quot; He 
looked up as a nameless cadet entered his office, dropped off a stack 
of reports, and left in a slight haste. &quot;Now what?&quot; the Dragoon 
commander muttered as he went through the stack. &quot;I thought Shar-Tei 
was supposed to deal with this stuff while I was on assignment.&quot; 

&quot;Loving your job yet?&quot; Maze asked with a smirk. 

Tolaris was busy reading a short note from General Nephlyte and didn&#39;t 
pay attention. He&#39;s got the cathedral built on the site already? he 
thought. That was fast. I&#39;ll have to stop by and check it out later. 
He looked up as Maze poked him. &quot;Sorry, what was that?&quot; 

&quot;Just asking if you&#39;re loving your job yet.&quot; 

&quot;Very much so. If you want it, it&#39;s yours.&quot; 

Maze laughed. &quot;Sorry, but I&#39;m not quite dumb enough to accept any kind 
of job dealing with administration. Ah, no offense, Commander.&quot; 

Tolaris just sighed. &quot;Lieutenant, who did you want to have Hospitality 
send over last night?&quot; 

&quot;A beautiful woman by the name of Xenon. She has the most vivid shade 
of red hair you&#39;ve ever seen in your life, and she&#39;s got lots of it, 
too. I mean it&#39;s almost down to her waist.&quot; 

&quot;Uh huh. And how good are her massage skills?&quot; 

Maze smiled. &quot;Just between you and me, she&#39;s not the best but she&#39;s 
got a razor-sharp mind to go with a killer body. Talking to her is 
almost as much fun as letting her work on your back.&quot; 

&quot;I see.&quot; Tolaris stood up and stretched. He glanced at the chronometer 
on his desk and his mood lightened. &quot;Almost time for me to get back to 
my research on Earth. I understand being late for a dinner date is 
considered to be very rude and I certainly don&#39;t want to be that. I 
trust I can leave this case in your hands?&quot; he asked Maze, indicating 
the report of Solstice&#39;s death. 

Maze shrugged. &quot;Guess so, seeing how I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll go very far.&quot; 
He looked at Tolaris and grinned. &quot;Anyway, good luck with your, ah, 
research.&quot; He started to walk away, then stopped abruptly. &quot;Oh, and 
I&#39;ll see if Shar-Tei has managed to come up with anything else 
regarding her research.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded meaningfully. &quot;My thanks to both of you.&quot; 

&quot;Just be careful, boss,&quot; said Maze as he left the room. Tolaris sat 
back down to read the new reports when Maze slowly backed into the 
room, his face a sickly shade of white. &quot;Uh, boss...?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; the Dragoon commander asked with concern. 

&quot;There&#39;s a rather sizable crystal spider just sitting out here....&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Relax, Lieutenant. Dyvach won&#39;t hurt you unless 
you&#39;ve managed to get it mad. Now step aside and let him in here.&quot; 

Maze gulped and retreated to a far corner of the office. Seconds 
later, the weaver entered the room, chiming softly to itself. It moved 
over to the desk and deposited a dark crystal box. It chimed loudly to 
Tolaris for several seconds, then scuttled back out of the room. 

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Tolaris called out to the weaver&#39;s back. Maze nervously 
moved over to Tolaris&#39;s desk and looked at the strange box. The box 
was only seven inches long by two inches wide, having a depth of three 
inches. 

&quot;Since when has the Quartermaster been using spiders as delivery 
boys?&quot; 

The Dragoon commander chuckled. &quot;He hasn&#39;t. I had asked the weaver to 
replicate several items for me and I guess I forgot to pick them up 
before I went to Earth.&quot; 

He reached over and opened the box. Inside were several small 
rectangles of green paper, a colorless crystal rose, and a small 
sapphire pendant. He picked up the paper and examined it carefully. 

&quot;Earth money,&quot; he said, showing Maze. &quot;Used for assorted transactions. 
I&#39;m glad Dyvach brought this stuff to me before I left for Earth 
again. It&#39;s rather difficult to take someone out to dinner if you 
can&#39;t pay for the meal.&quot; 

&quot;Makes sense.&quot; Maze picked up the pendant. &quot;And I take it this is 
going to be a gift for the young lady?&quot; he said with a gleam in his 
eye. 

Tolaris deftly took the pendant out of his hands. &quot;I was considering 
it. I&#39;m curious to see how the human culture deals with gift-giving.&quot; 

&quot;Of course, I understand completely,&quot; Maze said with a wicked grin. 
&quot;Then what&#39;s this for?&quot; he asked, indicating the crystal rose. 

Tolaris&#39;s mood seemed to darken almost instantly. &quot;That, Lieutenant, 
is just a little insurance.&quot; 

&quot;Against...?&quot; Maze prompted. 

&quot;None of your concern, Lieutenant.&quot; He tapped his ear a few times, 
then made a circling motion with his finger. 

Maze nodded as he caught on. &quot;Right....&quot; he said slowly. &quot;Just your 
standard cover-your-butt-type insurance?&quot; 

&quot;Of course. That&#39;s a basic military tactic, Maze. Now if you&#39;ll excuse 
me, I do believe I have an appointment on Earth.&quot; 

The Dragoon lieutenant laughed. &quot;Have fun, boss,&quot; he said as he left. 

Tolaris sighed as he put the rose and pendant in his pockets. He cast 
a quick glance around to room to make sure he wasn&#39;t missing anything 
important, then concentrated on the Silkworm crystal he was carrying. 
He stepped through the whirling vortex and into the alley next to the 
library. 

Okay, now if I&#39;m here, then the park should be over.... there. He 
walked out of the narrow alley and down the street, noting with mild 
interest that the storm front was starting to push the low pressure 
system out of the way. He concentrated briefly and was surprised to 
find that something had been toying with the pressure system. 

I&#39;ll bet it was Ensign Tempest, he thought. The damage was easily 
fixed and the storm front halted its slow advance. The weather problem 
solved, he continued to walk down the street toward the park. 

When he got there, he found Ami sitting on a bench reading a book. He 
was about to say something when a thought occurred to him. Moving as 
silently as possible, he sat down a bit away from her, watching for 
her reaction. When she didn&#39;t notice, he sat back to study her. 

She is quite beautiful, he thought as a light breeze blew around the 
park. The wind stirred her blue-tinted hair and he watched as she 
reached up to move a stray lock of hair out of her line of vision. Her 
hair really brings out the color of her eyes, he thought. 

The breeze picked up in intensity, blowing Ami&#39;s hair past her face. 
She shut her book and closed her eyes, sitting back with a soft smile 
on her lips. So she enjoys the cool touch of the wind, thought 
Tolaris. He studied the soft smoothness of the skin on her face and 
neck. But I don&#39;t think she spends much time out in the sun since her 
skin isn&#39;t very dark. 

She suddenly opened her eyes and looked him. She blushed at his gaze 
and sat up quickly. &quot;Oh, Tolaris! I didn&#39;t see you there,&quot; she said 
with a shy smile. &quot;How long have you been sitting here?&quot; 

The Dragoon chuckled. &quot;Only about three minutes, actually. You looked 
like you were busy, so I didn&#39;t want to disturb you.&quot; 

&quot;I wasn&#39;t really busy, just waiting for you to arrive.&quot; 

Tolaris stood up and held out his hand. &quot;Shall we go, then?&quot; 

Ami blushed a darker shade of red as she took his hand and was helped 
up. &quot;So where are we going?&quot; she asked. 

The Dragoon shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know, you tell me. Remember, I just got 
here, so I have no idea what kind of places to eat are around here or 
what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not.&quot; 

Ami thought carefully. &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t mind, there&#39;s a new Chinese 
restaurant that just opened up not too long ago and I want to check it 
out. I hear the food is rather good and that it&#39;s not too expensive.&quot; 

&quot;Chinese it is,&quot; he said as he and Ami started walking down the 
street. &quot;Though I have to admit, Ami, that I&#39;ve never had Chinese 
before.&quot; 

Ami looked up at him. &quot;You haven&#39;t, hmm? Well, I think you&#39;re going to 
like it. It can get rather spicy but it&#39;s almost always delicious.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like fun.&quot; 

Ami looked down at the concrete and her blush returned. &quot;Tolaris, 
would you mind if I asked you a personal question?&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;Sure, but I can&#39;t guarantee any answers.&quot; 

&quot;How old are you?&quot; 

He chuckled. &quot;Twenty-four,&quot; he said with a smile. Good thing I saw 
that one coming down the pipe, he thought. Instant age-reduction. Just 
lose the hundreds place on your age and no one will notice the 
difference. &quot;And what about you?&quot; 

&quot;Fourteen.&quot; She looked up and gave him a strange look. &quot;How is it that 
you&#39;re a commander at your age? I thought it took several years to 
obtain any decent rank.&quot; 

The Dragoon broke out into a cold sweat. Okay, think fast. What did 
that book say it was...? &quot;I was part of the Reserve Officer&#39;s Training 
Corps in the college I went to. It gives the cadets military training 
and rank as they go to school. Granted that&#39;s not much experience, but 
that&#39;s why we&#39;re used as reserves.&quot; 

&quot;Ah, so you&#39;re not active military, then?&quot; 

&quot;No, I&#39;m active. I just don&#39;t have any real command ability.&quot; He 
laughed softly, then added, &quot;I command a desk and paperwork, that&#39;s 
about it.&quot; Which if you think about it really isn&#39;t too far off the 
truth. 

Ami smiled. &quot;Have you been at it long?&quot; 

&quot;Two and a half years.&quot; I like this, Tolaris thought. Just take the 
real number, hack off the highest digit-place, and poof! Instant 
answer. &quot;So what about you? Of course you&#39;re too young to have a 
career now, but what do you plan on doing in the future?&quot; 

&quot;I hope I can become a doctor one day.&quot; 

&quot;That sounds interesting. Which field?&quot; 

&quot;Pediatrics. I&#39;ve spent a bit of time volunteering in a day-care 
center and I&#39;ve found that I like working with children.&quot; She paused 
and giggled. &quot;I can&#39;t say for sure if I like them enough to want to 
have one of my own, but I would like to work with them.&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Doctor Mizuno. It sounds nice, don&#39;t you think?&quot; 

Ami blushed lightly. &quot;Not precisely.&quot; She caught his curious look and 
explained. &quot;Well, a doctorate takes ten years to get and I seriously 
hope I&#39;m married before then.&quot; 

The Dragoon smiled. &quot;I see. Have your eyes on any likely candidates?&quot; 
He watched with interest as Ami blushed deeper than he had ever seen. 
Okay, what did the book say about blushing? He thought for a second 
and came up with several possible explanations, a few of which he 
wasn&#39;t quite sure he liked. 

&quot;No, I&#39;ve been way too busy with my studies to think about finding 
someone like that. But I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll meet someone, eventually.&quot; 

&quot;Hopefully,&quot; Tolaris teased. Trust me, he thought, eventually could 
mean a great deal of time. I&#39;ve been waiting for seventy-two decades 
for a special someone. Of course, I&#39;ve never really went looking and I 
probably wouldn&#39;t know that special someone if she came up and kissed 
me. 

&quot;And is there someone waiting for you back home?&quot; Ami said, her blush 
starting to fade slightly. 

&quot;If there is, I don&#39;t know about it. No, I&#39;ve spent my time involved 
with my work as well.&quot; He stopped and gently placed his hand on Ami&#39;s 
arm. &quot;Just between you and me, it was rather miserable. I&#39;ve had 
friends who were dating in college and to me it seemed that their 
lives were infinitely happier. Granted their grades weren&#39;t as high as 
mine, but they passed just the same.&quot; 

Ami gave him a curious look and the Dragoon continued. &quot;Ami, perhaps 
you don&#39;t realize this, but it&#39;s not your grades that matter, it&#39;s 
that you pass. High grades are excellent, but the military didn&#39;t care 
what my grades were. They just wanted above a certain grade point 
average. My friends passed just as well as I did, but they were 
happier with their lives. 

&quot;I&#39;m not saying just do the bare minimum to pass, Ami. I&#39;m only saying 
that you shouldn&#39;t sacrifice your happiness in life for a few extra 
tenths of a point that won&#39;t mean much in the outside world. You 
should study hard, but also set some time aside to enjoy life, to get 
out and do stuff.&quot; 

Ami nodded. &quot;I think I understand what you&#39;re saying.&quot; 

Tolaris looked at her, a thought stirring in his mind. Perhaps I have 
spent too much of my time working and that it is time to go looking 
for that special someone. Could this be why I find myself attracted to 
her? 

He looked up and smiled. &quot;Is this the restaurant you were talking 
about?&quot; he said as he pointed to a building across the street. 

Ami turned her head and nodded. &quot;Yes, that&#39;s the place. It doesn&#39;t 
look to be too crowded. That&#39;s good.&quot; She turned around to find 
Tolaris offering his arm. 

&quot;Shall we go?&quot; 

Ami blushed as she took his arm, and together they crossed the street 
and into the restaurant. Far off in the distance, the idle storm 
rumbled softly to itself as an unseen force reached up and gently 
pushed the low pressure system away, allowing the storm to once again 
resume its slow march toward the city. 

The figure standing high up in the treetops chuckled to herself. &quot;I 
hope you enjoy your dinner, Commander,&quot; she said softly as she 
pocketed the tiny weather-control crystal. &quot;It may turn out to be your 
last.&quot; She concentrated briefly, then disappeared in a whirlwind of 
flower petals. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Tolaris and Ami left the restaurant an hour later, Ami looking amused 
as Tolaris had a slight difficulty walking in a straight line. &quot;Well, 
I warned you that General Tso&#39;s Chicken was hot and spicy,&quot; laughed 
Ami. &quot;Are you sure you&#39;ll be okay?&quot; 

&quot;Just as soon as the indigestion passes. Trust me, I&#39;ve had worse 
cases, so I&#39;ll be fine. Still, I think the pain is well worth the 
experience.&quot; 

Ami smiled. &quot;Thank you for dinner, Tolaris.&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;And thank you for your help yesterday.&quot; He was 
about to say more when he looked up at the sky and frowned. 

&quot;What is it?&quot; Ami asked with slight concern. 

&quot;That storm has moved in,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;I thought there was 
supposed to be a low pressure system over the city keeping it away. 
The storm shouldn&#39;t have gotten here until nightfall.&quot; Which means 
someone has been messing with my weather, he thought darkly. 

Ami shrugged. &quot;That&#39;s the weather for you.&quot; 

Tolaris made a face. &quot;I had hoped to spend some time taking a walk in 
the park with you before it started to storm.&quot; 

Ami blushed lightly. &quot;Well, we could still do so, and if it does start 
to rain we could always go hide in the gazebo.&quot; 

&quot;That sounds like a good idea, Ami.&quot; 

They walked in silence toward the park, Ami trying to figure out why 
she liked the idea of a walk in the park with Tolaris and the Dragoon 
brooding about the impending storm. 

I don&#39;t get it, Tolaris thought as he concentrated his powers on the 
storm front. That low was here, but it feels like someone dissipated 
it. He looked up as he felt Ami shiver slightly. 

&quot;Cold?&quot; he inquired. 

&quot;Not exactly. I just felt a brief chill, that&#39;s all.&quot; Please, just let 
it be that and not another Negaverse trap, she thought. But the 
feeling had vanished as quickly as it had come so she didn&#39;t worry too 
much about it. 

The wind picked up slightly, bringing with it a hint of rain and a 
very soft rumble of thunder. Tolaris and Ami exchanged glances and she 
smiled. 

&quot;So much for a walk in the park,&quot; she laughed. 

&quot;Perhaps we could still sit in the gazebo and talk until it passes,&quot; 
he suggested. 

&quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Ami said softly. 

The wind stirred, bringing with it the lightest of drizzles. They 
picked up their pace and made it to the gazebo just as the rain 
started to fall. Ami ran her fingers through her blue-tinted hair to 
get the water out and made a slight face. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; asked Tolaris. 

Ami shook her head. &quot;Not really. It&#39;s just that my hair gets somewhat 
uncooperative when it&#39;s wet.&quot; 

Tolaris laughed softly. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, Ami. It looks just 
fine on you, even when it&#39;s damp.&quot; 

She blushed and sat on the bench, looking out across the artificial 
lake and at the storm beyond. He sat beside her, also keeping an eye 
on the approaching weather front. The rain grew heavier and the wind 
picked up as another rumble thunder could be heard. 

&quot;Do you like storms, Ami?&quot; he said softly. 

&quot;Some of them.&quot; 

&quot;Which kinds?&quot; 

&quot;Rainstorms, mostly. I like thunderstorms as well, but only when 
they&#39;re gentle and mild. Heavy thunder and lightning tend to distract 
me when I try to do my work. Snowstorms are okay, too, just as long as 
they&#39;re light and airy. I don&#39;t like missing school because of ice or 
deep snow.&quot; 

&quot;Any particular reason you like rain?&quot; 

Ami smiled. &quot;I guess I find the sound of a gentle rain to be relaxing. 
I find that I can usually sleep a lot better if there&#39;s a rainstorm 
outside when I go to bed.&quot; She paused and looked over to him. &quot;You 
seem to like storms yourself.&quot; 

He laughed softly. &quot;Yes, but I prefer ones with power. I can&#39;t seem to 
explain it, really. It&#39;s like I can tap the energy of the storm, feel 
it as if it were part of me.&quot; A soft rumble of thunder echoed and 
Tolaris smiled. &quot;There are times I find a gentle storm to be relaxing 
as well, but I prefer to relax in the presence of good company.&quot; 

Ami started to blush again and looked away at the oncoming storm. 
Tolaris laughed softly as he laid his hand on top of hers. &quot;My job in 
the intelligence field is busy and stressful and this is the first 
time I&#39;ve managed to get an easy assignment since I joined. I&#39;m 
grateful for the help you&#39;ve given me, but I&#39;m also grateful for the 
company.&quot; 

&quot;Is that why you took me out to dinner?&quot; she asked quietly. 

&quot;My original intention was to thank you for your help, but I found 
that I wanted to spend more time in your company. I don&#39;t know why, 
but when I&#39;m with you, I feel more relaxed, more....&quot; he trailed off, 
unable to find the words. 

&quot;Happier?&quot; she suggested softly, studying the pleats of her skirt. 

Tolaris suddenly realized that he was happier in Ami&#39;s company and the 
realization brought several emotions that were new to him. &quot;Yes,&quot; he 
said, his mind puzzled by the new feelings he was experiencing. &quot;And 
how do you feel about this?&quot; 

&quot;I.... It feels strange when I&#39;m with you,&quot; she said, her face a 
delicate shade of pink. &quot;It.... makes me feel warm and calm....&quot; 

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; he said softly. 

&quot;Yes....&quot; Ami said quietly. 

A strange calm descended on Tolaris&#39;s mind and the whirlwind of 
thoughts that had been plaguing him about his emotions came to a halt. 
A distant part of his mind noticed the wind wasn&#39;t blowing as hard as 
it was before and the rain was lighter. I hope I&#39;m not losing control 
of my powers, he thought. 

A sudden thought occurred to him. Losing control.... could human 
emotions be making me lose control? he thought. He stood up and walked 
to the far side of the gazebo, leaning on the railing and looking out 
across the lake. Is this why Jedyt and I have been having problems? Is 
it because of human emotions? 

&quot;Tolaris, how long will you be in Tokyo?&quot; Ami asked from behind him. 

Good question, he thought. &quot;I don&#39;t know. It all depends on how fast I 
can get the information I need. Plus, I received word this morning 
that I may have to report back to the base if something new develops. 
I don&#39;t think it should take more than three days.&quot; If it does, he 
thought, then Queen Beryl is going to want to have words with me and 
they won&#39;t be nice ones. 

&quot;I was just wondering, that&#39;s all....&quot; Ami said, an odd note in her 
voice. 

He turned around. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; 

Ami turned pink. &quot;I was just.... curious....&quot; she said hesitatingly. 

Tolaris slowly walked over to her. &quot;There&#39;s more to it, isn&#39;t there?&quot; 

Her gaze slid down to the wooden flooring. &quot;Well.... yes....&quot; 

&quot;Something you&#39;re not sure you can admit to yourself?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....&quot; she said, her voice barely above a whisper. 

Tolaris reached out and stroked her cheek. &quot;Tell me what you&#39;re 
feeling.&quot; 

Ami closed her eyes at his touch. &quot;I.... I don&#39;t know what it is that 
I&#39;m feeling.... It&#39;s warm and peaceful.... soothing.... It makes me 
sort of tingle all over....&quot; 

&quot;Have you ever felt this way before?&quot; 

&quot;No....&quot; 

&quot;And do you like this feeling, Ami?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....&quot; she said softly. 

Perhaps it&#39;s not just me after all, Tolaris thought. Perhaps even 
humans are affected by the intensity of their own emotions. How 
strange it should be that way, and yet it feels somehow right. Am I 
feeling what she is feeling? He continued to stroke her cheek, 
wondering why he was doing so and how it felt both odd and natural. 

&quot;Tell me, Ami, how does my touch feel to you?&quot; he found himself 
asking. 

Her voice was soft as she replied. &quot;It feels warm.... gentle....&quot; 

&quot;Does it feel like what you&#39;re feeling inside?&quot; 

&quot;In some ways,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Can you tell me how?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s relaxing.... soothing.... makes me feel warm inside....&quot; 

A sudden question came to Tolaris&#39;s mind. &quot;Does this feel right to 
you, Ami?&quot; he asked gently. 

&quot;I don&#39;t understand.&quot; 

&quot;Does this feel.... natural that you should be feeling this way?&quot; 

&quot;Yes....&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s conscious seemed to suddenly detach itself from the rest of 
his body, and he found himself acting on a combination of instincts, 
desires, and emotions. His hand stopped stroking Ami&#39;s cheek and slid 
below her chin, slowly tilting her head up. He bent his own head down, 
and their lips met. 

In that single instant, everything became unbelievably clear to 
Tolaris. A word surged up from his memory, a word whose definition was 
only partially understood before and was completely understood now: 
Love. Tolaris realized that he was in love with Ami, and that she was 
in love with him. 

Time seemed to lose meaning as they kissed, eventually breaking apart 
for air. Ami leaned against Tolaris, wrapped her arms around his 
waist, and rested her head against his chest. Tolaris instinctively 
embraced Ami&#39;s slender form and rested his head on her shoulders. 

They held each other silently, each wishing that the feeling would 
last forever. No words needed to be shared between them to express 
their newly recognized emotions to the other. 

Outside the gazebo the rain continued to fall gently as the wind 
stirred the landscape, bearing silent witness to the emotions between 
the Sailor Scout and the Dragoon. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Waaahhh, I hate rain!&quot; Serena complained as she ran down the street. 
&quot;I told you we should have stayed at the arcade!&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Luna as she kept pace, &quot;But we need to find Ami. I 
sensed that the Negaverse was nearby and we need her computer to find 
it.&quot; 

The blonde made a face. &quot;But she&#39;s on her dinner date with that guy. 
Why can&#39;t we wait for her to give us a call when she&#39;s finished?&quot; 

&quot;Because this sort of stuff takes precedence over personal lives, 
Serena. You know that. Ami might be upset at the intrusion but she 
understands.&quot; 

Serena sighed. &quot;Yeah, I know. Still, where are we going to find her? 
If she had any brains, which she does, she&#39;d be inside someplace where 
it&#39;s nice and dry.&quot; She nearly tripped over Luna as the cat came to a 
halt. 

&quot;That looks like her over there in the park,&quot; said Luna. 

Serena peered through the rain. &quot;Well, there aren&#39;t too many girls 
with short blue hair in this city, so I guess it&#39;s her.&quot; She took a 
closer look and a smile crossed her face. &quot;Mmm, I think she&#39;s got her 
boyfriend in there, and they look rather occupied....&quot; 

&quot;Just get going, Serena. Remember, you were headed home and the rain 
got too heavy for you, so you decided to stop in the gazebo until it 
lets up.&quot; 

&quot;Right.&quot; She picked Luna up and ran for the gazebo, making sure she 
made enough noise for Ami to hear her coming first. 

&quot;Hi, Ami!&quot; she said as she walked into the gazebo. 

If Ami was annoyed by the interruption, she didn&#39;t show it. &quot;Hi, 
Serena. What are you doing running out in the rain?&quot; 

&quot;Trying to get out of it.&quot; She sat on the bench and started to fuss 
with her soaked hairstyle. Luna leapt down and proceeded to shake a 
sizable amount of water all over the place. 

&quot;Serena, I&#39;d like you to meet Commander Tolaris Sterling. Tolaris, 
this is my friend Serena,&quot; said Ami. 

The Dragoon nodded a polite greeting. &quot;A bit wet out there, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

Serena nodded. &quot;Yeah. Umm, you two mind if I stay put until this rain 
lets up?&quot; 

Ami and Tolaris exchanged a quick glance before Ami nodded her head. 
&quot;No problem, Serena.&quot; She walked over to scratch Luna behind her ears. 
&quot;And how are you doing, Luna?&quot; she asked, and received a soft meow in 
response. 

Tolaris turned around to look out across the lake. He smiled to 
himself as he focused his mind on the storm. Immediately, the rain 
lightened. After a few seconds, the rain had ceased entirely. It&#39;s 
times like these where I can truly appreciate my powers, he thought to 
himself. 

Behind him, Ami and Serena shivered lightly as an icy chill blew 
through them. Serena felt Luna tugging on her socks and she turned to 
Ami. 

&quot;Would you mind if I borrowed your compact? I think I&#39;ve got a tangle 
in my hair and I want to get it out.&quot; 

Ami nodded slowly and handed her the computer. She then walked over to 
stand next to Tolaris, hoping to distract him from Serena&#39;s 
activities. &quot;I&#39;m sorry about this,&quot; she said with a gesture behind 
her. 

Tolaris laughed softly. &quot;No matter, Ami. The storm appears to be done 
with the rain for now, so....&quot; 

&quot;Ami, step away from him,&quot; commanded a voice behind Tolaris, and his 
eyes widened with recognition. That&#39;s the same voice I heard at the 
library! he thought. 

He turned around to find Serena sitting with the cat in her lap, 
holding a strange device. Much to his astonishment, the cat spoke up. 
&quot;Ami, get away from him. He&#39;s from the Negaverse.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; Ami cried out as she rushed over to her friends. &quot;Give me 
that thing!&quot; She poked at it for a few seconds, then her eyes went 
wide in shock. 

Several things fell into place in Tolaris&#39;s mind. The scanner.... the 
voice.... Two girls.... the blue-haired Sailor Scout.... Please, don&#39;t 
let it be like this. 

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me you two are the Sailor Scouts I&#39;ve been looking for,&quot; 
he said with a heavy sigh. 

Serena stood up, unceremoniously dumping the cat onto the floor. 
&quot;That&#39;s right, Nega-creep, and you&#39;re about to get moon dusted!&quot; 

Ami reached out and grabbed her arm. &quot;Serena, you can&#39;t.&quot; 

Luna stood up and shook her head. &quot;Ami, what&#39;s gotten into you?&quot; 

&quot;Really,&quot; said Serena. &quot;This is the guy who made us late to class when 
I got up on time. And trust me, you&#39;re going to pay for that one,&quot; she 
said to Tolaris. 

&quot;Serena, I love him,&quot; Ami said quietly. 

The blonde turned to stare at her friend in surprise. &quot;But Ami, he&#39;s 
from the Negaverse! He&#39;s the one who set those traps for us!&quot; 

Tears were forming in Ami&#39;s eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t care, you can&#39;t blast him.&quot; 

They both turned at the sound of dark laughter coming from the other 
side of the gazebo. 

&quot;Noble sentiments, but it won&#39;t save you. I have lived for over seven 
hundred years and have been in the Negaverse military for slightly 
over six centuries. My orders are to neutralize the Sailor Scouts and 
I have never let personal feelings come between me and my sworn duty. 
The cat is of no concern to me and will not be harmed. Surrender, and 
I promise you both a painless demise.&quot; 

&quot;Get real, creep,&quot; Serena shot back. &quot;We&#39;re going to make you wish you 
never heard of the Sailor Scouts.&quot; She her hand up over her head. 
&quot;Moon Prism Power!&quot; she yelled and started to transform. 

&quot;Ami, you&#39;ve got to transform!&quot; Luna said sharply and Ami reluctantly 
nodded her head. She reached into her pocket and pulled out her 
silvery wand. &quot;Mercury Power!&quot; she yelled. 

Tolaris watched their transformations with interest. So she really is 
a Sailor Scout, he thought. This is most unexpected. I hope I can 
manage to subdue them both without hurting them. He waited until their 
transformations were completed before addressing them again. 

&quot;Perhaps you girls don&#39;t quite realize what you&#39;re up against, so 
permit me to fully introduce myself. I am Tolaris, commanding officer 
of the Dragoons and the master of the elemental forces of nature.&quot; He 
concentrated and a gale sprang up that forced the Sailor Scouts to 
their knees. A great lightning bolt split the sky as a deafening 
thunderclap echoed throughout the park. And then as quickly as they 
had come, the summoned weather was gone. 

&quot;Believe me, I do not wish to harm you. Surrender now, and I give you 
my word you will not suffer needlessly.&quot; 

Sailor Moon laughed. &quot;Perhaps YOU don&#39;t know who you&#39;re up against. I 
am Sailor Moon, champion of justice! I will right wrongs and triumph 
over heart- Stealing Negaverse trash.... and that means you.&quot; 

The Dragoon sighed as he drew two crystals out of a pocket. &quot;So be it, 
Sailor Scouts,&quot; he said, brought his hand up to throw the crystals. He 
suddenly jerked his hand back as a rose slashed across his hand and 
embedded itself in the wooden flooring. The Sailor Scouts watched in 
surprised silence as tiny drops of gray blood splattered the ground 
next to the rose. 

&quot;Now what?&quot; Tolaris muttered as he looked up. Standing high up in a 
tree was a caped figure wearing a black tuxedo with a white demi-mask. 
The figure leapt down and landed between Tolaris and the Sailor 
Scouts. 

&quot;Tuxedo Mask!&quot; Sailor Moon said, her eyes going starry. 

&quot;I figured you two could use a little hand against this guy,&quot; Tuxedo 
Mask said in his deep voice. &quot;Mind if I cut in, Sailor Moon?&quot; 

Sailor Moon giggled at the pun. &quot;I think you already have.&quot; 

&quot;Indeed he has,&quot; said Tolaris, holding his bleeding hand. &quot;And who 
might you be?&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask bowed slightly to the Dragoon. &quot;Just a friend of theirs 
who feels the same way about love.&quot; 

&quot;I see. Since you desire to take Sailor Moon&#39;s place in this battle, 
it is only fitting that you will suffer her ultimate fate as well.&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask smiled. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&quot; 

Tolaris nodded once. &quot;So be it,&quot; he said, then lashed out with a blast 
of hurricane-force winds. The impact blew Tuxedo Mask off his feet and 
slammed him into a tree. The caped figure grunted in pain and threw a 
rose at Tolaris. 

The Dragoon laughed and summoned a wall of wind. His laughter faded as 
the projectile passed through the vertical hurricane winds as if they 
simply weren&#39;t there. Tolaris managed to move enough so the rose only 
slashed his shoulder instead of embedding in his chest. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know how you did that, but I&#39;m quite impressed. However, you 
are going to have to come up with more than that to defeat me,&quot; he 
said. He threw one of the crystals at Tuxedo Mask and watched as it 
was easily batted aside by his adversary&#39;s cane. 

A tiny tendril of energy stuck to the tip of Tuxedo Mask&#39;s cane as the 
crystal continued to fly through the air. The crystal suddenly changed 
course, rapidly orbiting Tuxedo Mask and spinning its thread of energy 
around him. In seconds he was completely wrapped in a shimmering 
field, unable to move. 

&quot;All too easy,&quot; Tolaris said as the field drained Tuxedo Mask of 
energy. He slumped to the ground as the energy field solidified into a 
crystal shell, rendering him completely immobile. 

&quot;Tuxedo Mask!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out. She turned to face Tolaris. 
&quot;What have you done to him?&quot; she demanded. 

&quot;I merely drained him of his energy and imprisoned him. To be honest, 
my dear Sailor Moon, that particular crystal was intended for you and 
your tiara. This is your last chance, Sailor Scouts. Surrender now or 
suffer his fate.&quot; 

Sailor Moon removed her tiara and transformed it into a shimmering 
disc. &quot;Here&#39;s your answer, wind bag. Moon Tiara.... MAGIC!&quot; she said 
as she cast the spinning disc toward Tolaris. 

The Dragoon frowned as he erected his wind wall again. The tiara 
struck the leading edge of the wall and suddenly veered off in a 
totally unexpected direction, slamming into the ground just in front 
of Tolaris. 

&quot;My tiara...!&quot; 

Tolaris&#39;s frown deepened. &quot;That was odd. The wind should have blown it 
straight upwards, not down at that angle.&quot; He bent down to pick up the 
tiara and screamed as the tiara&#39;s energy arced through his hand. He 
hastily stepped back, a slightly amused look on his face. &quot;That was a 
stupid move on my part,&quot; he said as he kicked the tiara back toward 
Sailor Moon. &quot;Try it again. I want to see why it turned like it did.&quot; 

Sailor Moon blinked in confusion as she picked up her tiara. She 
looked it over for dents or other damage, but was relieved when she 
could find none. Might as well try it again, she thought. &quot;Moon 
Tiara.... MAGIC!&quot; she cried as she threw the disc once again. 

The tiara hit the wind wall again and suddenly shot to the side with 
great force. It impacted with a wooden beam in the gazebo and embedded 
itself. 

&quot;Well, so much for that,&quot; said Tolaris as he threw the second crystal 
at Sailor Moon. The crystal flew high above her and came to a stop 
several inches above her head. A ghostly cone of blue energy shot 
downward, engulfing Sailor Moon. She screamed and collapsed as the 
energy was drained out of her. 

The energy field faded and Sailor Mercury gasped in horror at the 
sight. All of the color had been drained out of Sailor Moon&#39;s body, 
leaving only gray. Her blonde hair was now a dull gray, and her blue 
eyes were now a medium shade of black. The brilliant colors of her 
sailor suit were now mere shades of white and black. 

&quot;What.... have you.... done to me?&quot; she said weakly as she struggled 
to sit up. &quot;I feel.... so weak....&quot; 

&quot;The crystal drained part of your spirit as well as part of your 
energy. You will be very weak, Sailor Moon, but you will live. For 
now.&quot; 

Luna ran over to Sailor Moon and checked her vital signs. &quot;Her pulse 
is very faint, but she is alive. Sailor Mercury, you&#39;ve got to do 
something!&quot; 

Mercury blinked. &quot;What? Oh, right.&quot; She focused her energies into a 
sphere in front of her. &quot;Mercury Bubbles.... BLAST!&quot; The bubble shot 
out and expanded, filling the entire area with a rich and dense fog. 

The fog suddenly parted and Tolaris laughed softly. &quot;Tell me, is that 
the best you can do against the master of weather?&quot; The full 
realization of the situation finally became too much for her to handle 
and she fell to her knees, crying softly. 

The Dragoon walked over to her and knelt down. &quot;Surrender, Ami. Don&#39;t 
make me destroy you,&quot; he said softly. 

Mercury shook her head slowly. &quot;Tolaris, you have to destroy me. I 
don&#39;t think I could.... I mean....&quot; She flung her arms out and hugged 
him tightly. &quot;I love you,&quot; she cried into his chest, her body 
trembling with emotion. 

Tolaris&#39;s mind came to a complete halt as she spoke, forgetting 
everything about the current situation except for the single fact that 
he loved her. He returned her embrace, wondering how it was possible 
for him to have forgotten that. I can&#39;t, he thought, I simply can&#39;t 
bring myself to harm her. 

&quot;Ami, I.... I can&#39;t destroy you.... I.... I love you as well....&quot; 

Mercury&#39;s tears continued to fall as she hugged Tolaris even tighter, 
the two of them forgetting all that lay around them. Luna carefully 
made her way over to Tuxedo Mask to check his vital signs as well, 
noting with relief that his pulse was strong and steady. 

&quot;Ami, can you forgive me for what I&#39;ve done?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, but the others might not be able to.&quot; 

The Dragoon laughed quietly. &quot;I guess it would help matters if I let 
them go, wouldn&#39;t it?&quot; he said as he focused his energies. 

There was a sharp cracking sound as the crystal above Sailor Moon&#39;s 
head shattered into glittering shards of light. The light slowly 
settled over her inert body, restoring her energy and returning her 
color. She yawned as she carefully sat up and stretched, feeling the 
life return to her body. 

A second sound followed the first as the crystal shell around Tuxedo 
Mask shattered as well, restoring his energy. He grimaced in pain as 
he sat up, rubbing a sore spot on his back. 

Tolaris got up and drew Mercury to her feet. &quot;I have to go now, my 
love.&quot; 

&quot;Go where?&quot; she asked in confusion. 

&quot;I have to go back to face Queen Beryl about this.&quot; 

Mercury blinked. &quot;What? Why? She&#39;ll destroy you if she finds out about 
this!&quot; 

The Dragoon laughed softly. &quot;It&#39;s too late, she should already know by 
now. I have the suspicion that I&#39;ve been bugged ever since I took this 
little assignment and I think I know how. But that&#39;s not important 
anymore. I have to go back, Ami, or they&#39;ll send someone after me and 
I don&#39;t want to spend the rest of my time being hunted like an 
animal.&quot; 

&quot;But I&#39;ll never see you again!&quot; she said as she started crying once 
more. 

&quot;Maybe, maybe not.&quot; He reached into his pockets and pulled out a 
sapphire pendant and a crystal rose. He nestled the pendant between 
the petals of the rose and concentrated all his energies. The rose 
turned a deep golden color briefly and the Dragoon gasped. The glow 
faded and Tolaris removed the gem from the rose, handing the pendant 
to Mercury. 

&quot;Here, a gift. Something to remember me by,&quot; he said. He then turned 
to Tuxedo Mask. &quot;You are the guardian of these two, correct?&quot; 

Tuxedo Mask nodded his head. &quot;In a sense, yes. My job is to give them 
a helping hand when they&#39;re in need.&quot; 

&quot;Then take this,&quot; Tolaris said as he tossed him the crystal rose. 
&quot;Make sure that she can get it when she needs it. It just might save a 
life.&quot; 

&quot;I understand,&quot; Tuxedo Mask said. He turned to face the Sailor Scouts. 
&quot;I believe I am no longer needed here. Take care, Sailor Scouts. We 
shall meet again,&quot; he said, and with a flick of his cape he was gone. 

&quot;And I must be going as well,&quot; Tolaris said softly. 

&quot;No! Can&#39;t you stay, even for a little while?&quot; Mercury pleaded. 

The Dragoon coughed lightly and shook his head. &quot;No, my time is now 
quite limited, I assure you. Take care, dearest Ami, and good luck 
with your school work.&quot; He pulled the Silkworm crystal out of his 
pocket and concentrated. A wormhole flared into existence behind him 
as he kissed Mercury one last time. 

&quot;Goodbye, my love,&quot; he said as he stepped into the whirling vortex. 
The wormhole flared once more and then he was gone. 

&quot;No, wait! Tolaris!&quot; Mercury said as she reached out only to touch the 
empty air. She slowly fell to her knees, crying softly once more. 
Sailor Moon gently squeezed her shoulder as Luna quietly curled up in 
her lap. 

Outside, the storm rumbled softly to itself as a gentle rain began to 
fall in the park, a final parting gift from Tolaris. The rain lasted 
well into the night, the falling drops kept company by the falling 
tears of true love. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The audience chamber was filled with Queen Beryl&#39;s minions when 
Tolaris stepped into the room, flanked by four Security guards. The 
guards retreated to the edges of the chamber, leaving Tolaris to walk 
alone up to the throne. He bowed to the dark queen and waited for her 
to speak. 

&quot;Commander Tolaris, I have monitored your recent activities with 
regard to your confrontation with the Sailor Scouts. Not only did you 
fail to destroy them, you allowed your personal feelings to interfere 
with your mission which led to your subsequent behavior. You stand 
charged with treason, Commander. What do you have to say about this?&quot; 

The Dragoon&#39;s voice was strong and clear as he spoke. &quot;I plead guilty, 
my Queen.&quot; A ripple of astonishment ran throughout the assembled 
crowd, for no one could remember ever hearing someone plead guilty to 
a charge from Beryl. 

Beryl&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;So be it. According to the law there is no 
need for further explanations once you plead guilty, and I could 
simply destroy you where you stand. But I am curious as to why a 
Dragoon who has served over six hundred years in the service with 
distinction, and whom I considered to be one of my most trusted and 
loyal soldiers, why he would suddenly become a traitor.&quot; 

Tolaris coughed lightly before responding. &quot;I doubt that anyone in 
this room could ever understand my reasons. I became friends with a 
human girl on Earth, and our friendship developed into something I 
never expected. I found that very little mattered to me when I was 
with her, not even my mission.&quot; 

He made a face and coughed again. &quot;The emotion deepened even further 
that I thought was possible, to the point where nothing mattered to me 
except her. Not even turning out to be a Sailor Scout changed my 
emotions for her, and that is why I acted as I did. I did it for her, 
and for her love.&quot; 

Queen Beryl laughed, a deep and bitter sound. &quot;So it seems that even 
the mighty Dragoon commander is as weak as a human. I wonder how you 
could have lived for as long as you have with such a tragic weakness.&quot; 
She stood up to her full height and glared down at Tolaris. 

&quot;For your failure and your treason you will suffer the ultimate 
penalty: To be locked away in Eternal Crystal, your body frozen but 
your mind still alive to endlessly regret you having ever crossed me. 
Your only companion will be the pain and suffering of your soul as you 
look back on what you have done today. Should you have any final 
business to attend to, you have one minute to do so.&quot; 

Tolaris bowed and turned around. &quot;Lieutenant Commander Shar-Tei, I 
would speak with you briefly.&quot; The silver-haired Dragoon stepped 
forward and Tolaris spoke quickly. &quot;I want you to release the archive 
lock on my notes regarding weather control. Make sure that Ensign 
Tempest from Security gets a copy and that she gets a copy to the 
little girl we had a talk about earlier. Also, in my quarters you will 
find a pet of sorts. I ask that you find someone to take care of it.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll see to it, Commander,&quot; she said quietly, her featureless red 
eyes showing no signs of emotion. 

&quot;Thank you. General Nephlyte, this belongs to you,&quot; Tolaris said as he 
threw the Silkworm crystal across the room. &quot;If you&#39;ll examine the 
crystal, I believe you will find one of Zoisite&#39;s monitoring devices. 
I don&#39;t have the time to prove it, but it&#39;s the only explanation that 
would make sense about her activities.&quot; 

Tolaris didn&#39;t stop to see the faces of either Nephlyte or Zoisite 
before he turned to face Queen Beryl. &quot;I am ready, my Queen,&quot; he said 
simply. 

Beryl smiled coldly. &quot;You always did manage to make sure your loose 
ends were taken care of. Now it&#39;s my turn to cut a loose end.&quot; She 
concentrated and Tolaris was wrapped in a shimmering field of light. 
He didn&#39;t have time to scream from pain before the light solidified 
into a transparent crystal shell. 

&quot;Let this be a lesson to traitors,&quot; Beryl said, her voice echoing 
across the vast chamber. &quot;I do not tolerate failures, and I do not 
tolerate having weak soldiers. Those who fall prey to his folly shall 
suffer the same fate.&quot; 

A vortex opened above the crystal prison, drawing it into a distant 
and harsh dimension. The crystal tumbled through the desert air 
briefly before it landed in the hard sands of the wasteland. 
Surrounding it were thousands of other crystals like it, each one a 
frozen servant of Beryl&#39;s. 

The vortex closed, and the crystal was lost to the desert winds 
forever. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Ami, are you sure you&#39;ll be okay?&quot; said the voice on the phone. &quot;I 
mean, you&#39;ve been rather depressed for over a week now. Luna and I are 
staring to really get worried about you.&quot; 

Ami sighed as she laid back into the mass of pillows on her bed. &quot;I 
know, Serena. It&#39;s just.... well, I really care about him. I don&#39;t 
know if he&#39;s coming back or not, or even if he&#39;s still alive.&quot; 

There was a quiet sound, then a second voice was heard on the line. 
&quot;Ami, I know this is extremely hard on you but you can&#39;t let your 
feelings get in the way of the rest of your life.&quot; 

Ami closed her eyes and tried not to sigh again. &quot;I know, Luna. But 
it&#39;s hard to just forget the way I felt when I was with him. Now that 
he&#39;s gone, I can&#39;t imagine feeling that way with anyone else....&quot; She 
took a deep breath to calm herself as she felt the tears form in her 
eyes again. 

&quot;Ami, listen to me. I know how you feel. I was in love once, a long 
time ago. We made each other quite happy and made plans to spend our 
future with each other. When he passed away from a severe illness, I 
thought I would never get over it. Even to this day I still mourn his 
loss, but I don&#39;t let it get in the way of my life. Granted the pain 
isn&#39;t as sharp now as it was way back then, but I can still deal with 
it and you must learn to do the same.&quot; 

Ami wiped away a tear and sat up. &quot;I understand, Luna. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll 
get over it, given time.&quot; 

&quot;Never forget that his love will always be with you, even if he no 
longer is. Trust me on that, Ami. Sleep well, and I shall see you 
later.&quot; 

&quot;Good night, Luna,&quot; Ami said softly. &quot;And thanks.&quot; 

&quot;Quite welcome.&quot; There was another quiet sound as Serena came back on 
the phone. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to have to call it a night as well. Ami. 
Try not to stay up too late studying again, okay?&quot; 

Ami managed to laugh. &quot;Okay, Serena, but it&#39;s only nine-thirty.&quot; 

A quiet laugh. &quot;Hey, just because you can bury your nose in a book for 
hours on end doesn&#39;t mean anyone else can. Just don&#39;t you ever forget 
that I&#39;m your friend and I&#39;m here if you need me.&quot; 

Ami smiled. &quot;I haven&#39;t forgotten that yet, Serena, and thank you for 
all that you&#39;ve done for me.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re more than welcome, Ami. Good night, and I&#39;ll see you in class 
tomorrow morning.&quot; 

&quot;Sleep well, Serena,&quot; she said, then set the receiver back on its 
cradle. She laid back into the pillows once more and started to 
silently cry. Tolaris, I love you, she thought as the tears slid down 
her cheeks. Her hand absently went up to her throat to caress the 
sapphire pendant she wore. 

She blinked in surprise as the gem felt warm to her touch. She tilted 
her head down to look at it and almost screamed. It&#39;s glowing! she 
thought. What is it doing? Why do I feel so strange all of a sudden? 

The pendant emitted a glittering cloud of tiny blue motes. Ami watched 
in fascination as they swirled around the room on unseen wind currents 
before they merged into a humanoid form. As quickly as they had come, 
the tiny motes faded into nothingness, leaving the now-solid figure 
behind. 

&quot;Tolaris...?&quot; Ami whispered, not believing what she was seeing. &quot;It is 
really you?&quot; 

The Dragoon flexed his muscles experimentally. &quot;Unless I&#39;m dead and 
this is Hell, yes.&quot; He barely had enough time to brace himself before 
Ami leapt off the bed and into his arms, tears of happiness streaming 
from her eyes. 

&quot;I thought you were gone and I had lost you forever....&quot; she cried 
into his chest. 

Tolaris wrapped his arms around her tightly. &quot;Not quite,&quot; he 
whispered. &quot;It takes slightly more than Queen Beryl&#39;s wrath to keep me 
away from you. At least, for the time being.&quot; 

Ami blinked away her tears. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;Let me explain. Physically, I&#39;m still locked away in that crystal in 
the Negaverse. However, since part of my physical life-force exists 
here, my soul can travel here and manifest in a physical form.&quot; 

Ami blinked again. &quot;Part of your life-force...? But how?&quot; 

Tolaris smiled. &quot;Simple, my love. Your pendant contains a tiny portion 
of my essence, if you will. As long as the pendant is worn on a living 
being, it can act as a projector for my spirit. But there are two 
limits: First, due to the nature of the magic used in the process, my 
spirit can only travel here when the Earth&#39;s moon is on the far side 
of the planet, away from the light of the sun. And second, the moon 
must be above the horizon or the Earth&#39;s mass will block the necessary 
energy waves.&quot; 

Ami seemed slightly crestfallen. &quot;But those conditions only occur for 
a few hours each month.&quot; 

The Dragoon smiled gently. &quot;Would you prefer I not visit you at all?&quot; 

She hugged him tightly. &quot;I see your point, Tolaris. Still, you have no 
idea how happy I feel now that I know you&#39;re still alive and with me.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised, dearest Ami. Trust me, I probably feel the same 
way, and more. After all, you don&#39;t have to spend the rest of your 
time locked up in a tiny crystal prison in the middle of nowhere, 
unable to do anything but think.&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes went wide. &quot;What happened?&quot; 

The Dragoon explained to her the events that took place after his 
return to the Negaverse and his confrontation with Queen Beryl. 
&quot;However, I saw this coming and was able to plan ahead. She said I was 
good at taking care of my loose ends but even she didn&#39;t know how 
well. I may be out of her way, but I&#39;m not totally gone yet.&quot; 

Ami smiled and rested her head on his shoulder. &quot;Tolaris, I love you,&quot; 
she said quietly. 

&quot;I love you as well, Ami,&quot; he said softly in response. 

&quot;Will you ever be able to stay here with me forever?&quot; 

Tolaris closed his eyes. &quot;For now, no, but I don&#39;t know what will 
happen in the future.&quot; He paused for a moment, then looked into her 
blue eyes. &quot;My love, I&#39;m afraid I have to go now.&quot; 

Ami&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;But you just got here! I thought you 
could stay until the moon sets.&quot; 

&quot;I can, but it&#39;s setting now. It took me this long to figure out how 
to travel from the Negaverse to here. But now I know, my love, and 
next time I&#39;ll be ready as soon as the moon rises.&quot; 

Ami held onto him as tight as she could, not wanting him to go. &quot;I&#39;ll 
be here, Tolaris,&quot; she said softly. 

He bent down and kissed her as his form started to dissolve into a 
cloud of blue motes. &quot;Never forget I love you, Ami,&quot; he said, then was 
gone. 

She watched in silence as the cloud whirled around the room madly for 
a second, then merged into her pendant. The gem continued to glow for 
several minutes afterward, its soft light being reflected off the 
single tear running down her cheek. 

After that, Ami felt the darkness in her heart lift and she no longer 
felt so sad about life. She managed to finish her homework before the 
weariness of the previous week&#39;s emotional strain caught up with her 
and she fell into a gentle and peaceful sleep. Outside, with no 
discernable cause or reason, a soft rain began to fall. </pre>
