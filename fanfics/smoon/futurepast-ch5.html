Michiru&#39;s eyes opened slowly. Rolling over, snuggling deeper into the 
warmth of her down comforter, she noted the time. Midnight. She had 
slept since mid-day after the exhaustion of her first battle as Sailor 
Neptune, and for the first time in weeks, had slept deeply and had not 
been plagued by nightmare visions of a silence-ravaged future.

An inexplicable smile curled her lips upwards, dimples forming in her 
cheeks as the ghost of a chuckle left her mouth. Whatever she had dreamt 
of was vague at best, but a rush of warmth filled her soul with 
happiness. Vague memories of close friendships and ties to a child they 
had cared for filtered through her mind and she knew she had dreamt of 
her past life on the moon.

&quot;Haruka.&quot; She whispered softly, suddenly melancholy that her partner of 
old on both the battlefield and in the bedroom was unready, or worse, 
unwilling to join her, to be by her side.

&#39;But why?&#39; She asked herself. The Haruka of her past had been a 
dedicated friend, always by her side, and although she hadn&#39;t yet 
learned how they had become lovers, she knew their relationship had 
eventually become passionate. If she felt the same need for her partner 
in this life, how could Haruka&#39;s feelings for her have changed? Such had 
been what was implied by the reincarnation of her lover&#39;s body language 
and listless expressions.

There were many questions about her past life yet unanswered and Michiru 
found she wanted instant gratification. Most importantly, she wanted to 
know why the Haruka of the present, the stoically handsome playboy, or 
so the tabloids called her, was so different from the Haruka, the witty, 
sensual, carefree lover of a millennia past.

Michiru sighed, her cobalt eyes finally opening, admitting defeat. There 
would be no falling back asleep once she started thinking of that woman. 
She hoped that some fresh air might clear her mind.

Prone to the chill of the early spring night, Michiru rose, abandoning 
the warmth of her bed. Wrapping her slim form in a flannel robe, she 
strode to her apartment&#39;s main room and slid open the door to the 
balcony. The brisk night air caused her to wrap her arms around her 
chest as she stepped through the threshold. Small puffs of hot breath 
crystallized in the cool air as her cobalt eyes were drawn to the stars 
above.

The cool temperature and the cloudless, moonless sky amplified the glow 
of the stars, almost overpowering the neon glow of the Tokyo streets far 
below her as Michiru&#39;s eyes studied the constellations. She had never 
specifically studied astronomy, but had somehow inherently known much 
about outer space. She had always assumed her knowledge to be from 
osmosis through other classes, but now she had to wonder if there wasn&#39;t 
another reason for her intimate understanding of the cosmos.

Her breath caught in her throat as she picked out the faint glow of 
Neptune. Once, it was her home world, her mother planet, and if she 
squinted, Michiru could imagine that Uranus was there too, in the 
distance, as if waiting to be discovered...

Suddenly, the sounds of the street below her faded and a strange duet 
between piano and violin reached Michiru&#39;s ears. Initially, she wrote it 
off as a neighbor&#39;s radio, yet slowly, the duet grew louder, drawing 
Michiru&#39;s attention, and like an old friend&#39;s name that she couldn&#39;t 
quite remember, she cocked her head as she tried to realize why the song 
sounded so familiar.

The aqua haired girl shuddered and the spell cast by the ghostly song 
was broken. The cold suddenly too much for her to bear, even with her 
heavy robe, she quickly retreated to the warmth of her apartment.

About to throw herself to the mercy of her overstuffed couch, Michiru 
first eyed her violin in the corner of the room. The strangely familiar 
tune still playing through her mind, almost as if in a trance, the young 
woman approached it.

Methodically, she opened the hard plastic case and removed her bow. 
Supple and familiar from years of use, she tightened the fine strands 
before running the bow&#39;s strings through a well worn piece of resin with 
a practiced stroke. Then, taking the fragile instrument from its bed of 
blue velvet, she raised the violin to the crook of her neck and with 
inherent grace, arched her bow to its strings.

Unthinkingly, her fingers found the right notes as she recreated a song 
from memory and her mind began to wander, lost to the music in her head.

flashback

The sun had set hours ago. Michiru lifted the long teal skirts that 
billowed around her ankles as she ascended the stone stairs, the weight 
of the moon heavy on her shoulders. While Hotaru had aged rapidly in the 
eight months under their care, Setsuna and herself had reached out, 
looking for clues to an undetermined future to no avail. Nowhere outside 
their solar system was there any indication of a catastrophe that should 
have triggered the birth of Sailor Saturn.

Nowhere. There was no sign of a danger to come from anywhere outside 
their territories, yet still, the rapidly aging girl was among them. 
Unknowingly, Hotaru heralded a terrible demise.

Training had been increased in the face of the seemingly nonexistent 
threat, and each of the outer senshi increasingly found themselves in 
solo missions patrolling the outer reaches of their solar system. 
Michiru&#39;s mind wandered as she thought of her partner. At that very 
moment, Uranus was scheduled to be out scouting the area between Pluto 
and the Kuiper Asteroid Belt, an area of suspicion suggested by those of 
planet Earth. Michiru frowned as she remembered the strange unease she 
continued to sense from that blue planet that the Moon orbited and she 
forced herself to think of Haruka. At least those were happier thoughts.

Marginally happier, at least. Of late, between their missions, training, 
and raising young Hotaru as a family, what little time Michiru and 
Haruka had to spend together was precious and rare over the last couple 
months. And finally, when they were together, the tension between them 
was an impenetrable wall and Michiru didn&#39;t know if she could bear it 
any longer.

The senshi of the ocean had reached the point of no return, and she felt 
that if she didn&#39;t confess her feelings for the senshi of the wind, 
clear her conscious and move on, whether with, or without Haruka, she 
feared her pent up frustration might defeat her. No longer could she 
play the push and pull game of suggestive flirting and physical near 
misses that had ensued in the three long years that they&#39;d been together 
as friends and partners.

Michiru needed an answer, once and for all. She needed to know if Haruka 
loved her as she loved Haruka.

But first, she wanted to consult Setsuna. Only the older, wiser woman 
would know if it was a good idea to approach Haruka with her questions. 
After all, Michiru wasn&#39;t even sure if senshi were permitted a luxury 
such as love. Although it was true that Michiru knew Haruka better than 
anyone else in the entire Moon Kingdom, she needed reassurance to take 
that first step and she knew that Setsuna would be willing to listen to 
her concerns.

Cresting the rooftop at the top of the steps, Michiru spotted her 
friend. Setsuna sat in an oversized chair, concentrating diligently on a 
high powered telescope set before her where the dark of night closed in 
around the openness of space. Above them, the stars glowed brightly, 
illuminating the white mountains on the horizon. The Earth hung largely 
overhead, casting its gentle blue hue across the rooftop. Michiru second 
guessed disturbing her friend and silently, she turned to leave, 
suddenly doubting herself.

&quot;Michiru, wait.&quot; Setsuna&#39;s voice pierced the darkness.

The aqua haired woman turned to see the senshi of time still engrossed 
in her telescope. &quot;No really, Setsuna, it&#39;s nothing.&quot; She urged.

The garnet eyed woman pulled her face away from the lens, blinking in 
the solar glow of the night. &quot;Nothing?&quot; She asked cryptically, her voice 
laced with the suggestion that she knew why her friend had come to her.

Michiru sighed in defeat and Setsuna patted the seat next to her 
lightly, a welcoming smile on her face. The senshi of the sea took the 
proffered chair, her legs pressed tightly together and her hands clasped 
in her lap. &quot;Anything interesting in the sky tonight?&quot; She asked lamely.

Setsuna cocked an eyebrow. Avoidance and a loss of words was not 
Michiru&#39;s style. As her garnet eyes studied the mountains on the 
horizon, she understood what her friend was so desperately searching 
for.

&quot;Yes. I think you should do it.&quot; The tall woman spoke with certainty as 
her knowing garnet eyes warmed even the darkness of the night that 
closed in around them.

&quot;Do what?&quot; Michiru asked slowly, brows furrowed. Used to being the 
intuitive one, she was always thrown off when her friend, the Guardian 
of Time, knew what was on her mind.

&quot;Confess to Haruka.&quot; Setsuna clarified plainly, as though the thought 
were an every day occurrence or at the very least, something that should 
have been done long ago. A smile graced her enigmatic face as she laid a 
supportive hand on her friend&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I think you should do it. You 
love her, don&#39;t you?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s jaw hung open slackly and a sudden blush tinged her cheeks. 
Then, a serious, heart-felt dedication rippled through her and a drawn 
expression chiseled tight lines on her face. &quot;I do. So much that I would 
die for her, Setsuna.&quot;

Setsuna shivered despite herself as the intensity of Michiru&#39;s emotions 
caught her off guard and the stoic guardian of the time gate found she 
couldn&#39;t meet Michiru&#39;s eyes. With an expertise born from centuries of 
controlling her power to see the future, she pushed away the images that 
her friend&#39;s words had brought her. Images that proved Michiru&#39;s 
dedication to be frighteningly true.

Once content that she would not break taboo and tell her friend what she 
had seen, Setsuna filled the silence and continued. &quot;You&#39;re worried that 
senshi aren&#39;t allowed to love.&quot; The sapphire haired woman said plainly. 
Michiru nodded shyly and Setsuna continued. &quot;But don&#39;t forget that each 
of the inner senshi, including the Princess herself has a suitor from 
the planet Earth.&quot; She noted, watching Michiru&#39;s thoughtful eyes 
considering her point.

&quot;But what of love between two senshi?&quot; Michiru asked haltingly, her 
frightened voice barely more than a whisper.

Setsuna smiled, trying ease her friend&#39;s concerns. &quot;Queen Serenity would 
not deny that which makes you happy. She is too compassionate for that. 
If she thought the feelings that you and Haruka share were a danger to 
her kingdom, she would have disbanded the outer senshi the day you two 
first laid eyes on each other.&quot;

&quot;Feelings we... share?&quot; Michiru repeated slowly, a shocked expression on 
her pale features.

Setsuna smacked her lips in mock frustration. &quot;Please. The only ones who 
don&#39;t know that the two of you are in love with each other are Haruka 
and yourself!&quot; The guardian of time laughed lightly at Michiru&#39;s wide, 
cobalt eyes. &quot;Kaioh Michiru, for one so intuitive, I&#39;m surprised at you. 
How could you not know that Haruka would return your affections?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s mouth hung open, quietly stuttering with excitement and shock. 
She knew not how to respond to the revelation Setsuna had granted her.

Suddenly, a slow, sad melody crafted by ivory piano keys filled the 
silence of the quiet rooftop and Setsuna&#39;s eyes closed as she sighed 
softly, indulging in the music.

&quot;She&#39;s here, you know.&quot; Setsuna finally said softly.

&quot;Who?&quot; Michiru asked, confused.

&quot;Haruka. She&#39;s returned from her mission.&quot; Setsuna clarified, still lost 
to the crying melody that carried on the wind.

&quot;But she wasn&#39;t due to return for two days time!&quot; Michiru exclaimed, 
finally regaining her voice.

&quot;Apparently something drew her back here.&quot; The garnet eyed woman said 
suggestively with a small roll of her eyes at Michiru&#39;s naivety. 
Smiling, she stood and took Michiru&#39;s hands in her own, helping her to 
rise.

Michiru threw her arms around her friend&#39;s neck, hugging her quickly in 
thanks. Wordlessly, the aqua haired woman hurried from the rooftop. 
Finally understanding that the sad song that had captivated the very air 
she breathed belonged to Haruka herself, she used the crisp, clear notes 
of the piano to lead her to her love.

----------

Her music reflected her mood, slow and melancholic as the crisp notes 
echoed off the low roof above her in the alcove of the quiet outer 
senshi wing of the palace. A garden surrounded the open air atmosphere, 
the green, creeping vines lending to Haruka&#39;s sadness as a shimmering 
pool of water cast its reflections across the ceiling above her head.

As her fingers danced over the keys, Haruka reminisced about her recent 
mission. In the vastness of space, searching for a seemingly nonexistent 
enemy, she had never felt so lonely. It had been only two weeks time, 
but not one fraction of that time was spent without thinking of her 
partner.

In her solitude, Haruka found that she could no longer set aside the 
depths of her feelings for Michiru.

It was years ago that she had decided that what she felt for Michiru was 
love, but now, the senshi of the wind was certain that she could no 
longer hide her feelings from her partner. As their constant flirting 
intensified, she could no longer trust herself not to act out on her 
desires for the senshi of the ocean, she could no longer rein herself in 
through the temptation of Michiru&#39;s gentle caresses and sensual 
closeness. Now that she had returned from her mission two days early, 
Haruka found that she was afraid to even see Michiru at all.

So, she found solace in the piano. Her fingers hadn&#39;t touched the keys 
in more years than she could remember and she was quite sure that the 
object of her affection would never find her there. For the time being, 
Haruka felt safe. Safe from ending her friendship with Michiru, from 
ruining what they shared all because she could no longer contain her 
emotions for her partner. All because she felt differently for Michiru 
than Michiru felt for her.

No longer could Haruka provide only friendship for her partner.

Although her fingers never hesitated, the blonde woman&#39;s heart skipped a 
beat painfully inside her chest as another instrument matched hopeful 
harmony to her melancholic melody. The sound of a stringed instrument 
wailed sadly in tune to her ivory keys as the two instruments weaved an 
impromptu duet. For long moments, the instruments spoke for their 
composers, creating a tale of friendship, of hardship, of longing... of 
something more.

Finally, the sad song Haruka had slowly weaved, an apology to the one 
she believed she&#39;d hurt with her honest emotions, turned into a 
passionate, restless confession of an emotion wholly different. The duet 
culminated into a brilliant crescendo, the intensity of the chords and 
strings filling the night itself in its wake.

The echo of the instruments&#39; aftermath continued for long moments as the 
two composers finally looked up from their respective instruments and 
two pairs of eyes full of torrential emotions met each other in a 
stormy, needy gaze.

Haruka was the first to break eye contact with her partner and she 
practically growled as she stared down at her hands numbly. &quot;What are 
you doing here?&quot; She barked, recoiling at the harsh sound of her own 
voice.

&quot;I could ask you the same thing.&quot; Michiru said levelly, gracefully 
setting her violin down on the black surface of the piano. She refused 
to allow Haruka&#39;s frustration to get the better of her. She knew that 
her partner was apt to overreact when troubled and she tried not to take 
it personally.

Haruka&#39;s mouth snapped shut as she pointedly ignored the smaller woman, 
forcing herself to keep her eyes from Michiru&#39;s beauty. The senshi of 
the ocean always found a way to neutralize her brashness. They would 
have been perfect for each other. Abruptly, the tall woman rose from the 
piano bench, the wooden legs screaming across the stone floor, causing 
both of them to wince.

&quot;There was nothing out there, so I came back.&quot; Haruka finally answered. 
&quot;I&#39;ve yet to debrief the authorities on my mission, I still have work to 
do.&quot; With that, the blonde woman bowed slightly in an effort to distance 
herself from her partner and walked forward, bracing herself as she made 
to walk past Michiru, her gaze cast to the side to avoid eye contact.

Yet Michiru slid to the side, blocking Haruka&#39;s path and the taller girl 
walked right into her, the senshi of the wind&#39;s normally lightening fast 
reflexes seemingly dulled. The aqua haired woman reached up gently, 
silently, and with her hands, cupped the sides of the blonde&#39;s face to 
force her partner to look into her eyes. As her body pressed against the 
other woman&#39;s tall form, she was instantly distressed by the turmoil she 
found in Haruka&#39;s hazel eyes.

&quot;Haruka, your eyes... what&#39;s affecting you so deeply? What are you so 
scared of?&quot; Michiru asked quietly, her concern for her partner 
dominating her. Somehow she felt she knew the answer to her own 
question.

Haruka&#39;s jaw clicked shut, the closeness of her partner overwhelming her 
senses. The silence of their surroundings was deafening and she battled 
her own body to not respond to Michiru&#39;s touch. When suddenly, she felt 
Michiru&#39;s soft lips on her own in a gentle kiss, she felt hot tears well 
in her eyes.

Slowly, the aqua haired woman pulled away, her eyes opening slowly as 
she observed her partner&#39;s stiff posture. She couldn&#39;t tell if the 
moisture in Haruka&#39;s eyes were tears or simply an illusion created by 
the reflection of the pool by their feet. Her breath caught in her 
throat as she panicked. Had she read Haruka wrong? Had she 
misinterpreted the song they had composed? What had she done?

The tension between them was long past snapping when finally, Haruka 
repeated Michiru&#39;s gesture. Strong arms wrapped around a slim waist, 
pulling her partner closer to her body as her lips crashed down onto 
Michiru&#39;s in a desperate, searching kiss.

The senshi of the ocean was bombarded with emotion from the tall woman. 
As their lips met and their tongues danced, tears came to Michiru&#39;s eyes 
as she sensed the depth of Haruka&#39;s feelings for her. Her long fingers 
caressed Haruka&#39;s shoulders and twined in her short, sandy hair as she 
tried to use both her body and her mind to ease her partner, to assure 
her, to convince her that this was right, that this was what they both 
wanted.

And that was all they needed. There were no empty words between them, no 
questions left unanswered that their simple actions hadn&#39;t already 
answered. They knew now, their feelings for each other really were the 
same.

Slowly, as the initial desperate act slowed and finally stopped, the two 
women broke for air, each panting slightly in breathlessness, their 
pounding heartbeats filling their ears. Finally, Haruka&#39;s hazel eyes met 
Michiru&#39;s cobalt ones, no longer in avoidance. The blue glow of the 
Earth above painted their skin as the senshi of the wind broke into 
quiet chuckling, her normal carefree, happy personality having returned.

Michiru breathed a sigh of relief but cocked her head in question, never 
loosening her grip on her partner. &quot;Maa, what&#39;s so funny?&quot; She asked 
with raised eyebrows, finding Haruka&#39;s laugh contagious.

&quot;That we didn&#39;t do this three years ago!&quot; Haruka replied lightheartedly, 
once again leaning downwards to catch Michiru&#39;s lips with her own.

Michiru hungrily returned her partner&#39;s kiss, but then suddenly pulled 
away, eyeing Haruka with a righteous pout of mock irritation. &quot;I thought 
you had a debrief to attend?&quot; She accused.

&quot;Oh no, that can wait. After all, I&#39;m not supposed to be back for 
another two days.&quot; Haruka said slyly as she stole another kiss from her 
partner, her lips trailing sideways to capture the corner of Michiru&#39;s 
mouth, the crook of her tempting neck and down to the smooth skin of her 
collarbone.

Michiru giggled and tore herself from Haruka&#39;s grasp, the curls of her 
aqua hair bouncing as they framed her face. Wordlessly, she took her 
partner by her hand and led them both back to their rooms, leaving their 
instruments to wait for their return.

/flashback

Michiru blinked, her bow still pulling at the heart felt sound of the 
last note of the impromptu love song. Hot tears collected behind her 
cobalt eyes as the memory of the wordless confession of love she had 
shared with Haruka replayed through her mind. Now she knew. She knew how 
she and Haruka had confessed their love.

A blush crept up her cheeks as she remembered her very first vision of 
her past life that had come to her days ago. Haruka and herself running 
down the halls of the Moon Palace, hand in hand, mouth to mouth, and the 
events that ended in her own bed. She was now able to connect, full 
circle, her first memory to her latest. Unable to stifle the arousal she 
felt, Michiru set her violin and bow down on the coffee table gently 
before standing and striding back to the balcony. The cold air rushed 
her as she returned to the nightscape above her and she loosened her 
robe slightly to allow the colder temperature to cool her hot skin.

Thousands of possibilities rushed through Michiru&#39;s mind. Finally 
equipped with the knowledge she had previously desired, to understand 
how she and Haruka had confessed their love, now she didn&#39;t know what to 
do with it. It didn&#39;t change the fact that the Haruka of her time had 
somehow inexplicably changed.

Still, riding high on the emotions associated with her confession to her 
partner of the past, she yearned to again pursue the Tenoh Haruka of the 
present.

&quot;I don&#39;t know... when she&#39;ll awaken. She&#39;s not ready now, and I fear 
that any attempts to make her try may only push her father away. She may 
never realize her destiny, Michiru.&quot;

Sailor Pluto&#39;s voice repeated in Michiru&#39;s head, her cryptic warning 
haunted her.

&#39;Why? What happened to Haruka in her past life to turn her away from her 
destiny in this one?&#39; Michiru asked herself, her mood darkening. &#39;Surely 
it couldn&#39;t have been simply the millennia that had passed us by, for 
I&#39;m not that different than I was in my last life. And somehow, it seems 
deeper than anything that could have happened in our short lives in this 
time, I can feel it. Could what changed her be something that happened 
in the past that I haven&#39;t yet remembered?&#39;

A frown settled on her face as she realized her latest memories had 
turned up only even more unanswered questions.

Her eyes returned to the constellations above and again she found 
Neptune, but this time, she surely saw Uranus, faint as she was, glowing 
next to her planet, and slowly the frown that had gripped her features 
melted into an expression of determination as she remembered her 
response to Pluto.

&quot;I&#39;ll find a way to help Haruka. I&#39;ll find a way to make it work.&quot;

And she had meant what she said when she had sworn her allegiance to 
Pluto.

&quot;I&#39;ll find you first.&quot;

And she still held herself to the promise she had issued Haruka ages 
ago. She had told her lover then, that if Haruka couldn&#39;t find her in 
their next life, that she&#39;d find Haruka first. And Michiru planned to do 
so, for she knew now, that she had a duty to Haruka that transcended 
their senshi destiny.

Determined, Michiru swore to figure out whatever it was that had changed 
Haruka so drastically, even if it meant discarding Pluto&#39;s advice and 
confronting Haruka on her own.

----------

Preview, Chapter 6:

&quot;Listen, Michiru, Haruka hasn&#39;t been as receptive to all the memories 
and emotions you&#39;ve experienced. You have to understand that if she sees 
you right now, she&#39;ll feel only fear and anger.&quot; Setsuna explained 
calmly.

Michiru&#39;s quiet voice threatened to break. &quot;But why Setsuna? What about 
me scares her?&quot;

Setsuna sighed, her eyes garnet eyes trailing to the horizon. &quot;You 
haven&#39;t remembered all of your memories of your past life yet, have you, 
Michiru? &quot;

&quot;All of them?&quot; Michiru asked slowly, suddenly realizing that the 
beautiful harmony that had been her previous existence would have had to 
come to an end eventually.

Setsuna nodded sadly. &quot;Have you seen the end of the Silver Millennium 
through your eyes?&quot;

Michiru gasped as the memories flooded her.

... On the white horizon of the Moonscape approached Earth&#39;s Queen 
Beryl, her four generals and a mass of humans, their eyes glazed and 
unthinking as they charged forward, slaughtering all in their path. But 
behind them all hung a hideous creature of death and destruction, its 
shadowed silhouette reaching out with clawed fingers and sharp teeth, an 
unnamed terror of monumental power. This hellish figure was alive, a 
Medusa of enormous proportion, a menacing creature that threatened to 
set the sky itself on fire.

And it came from the Earth.

The Moon Kingdom, the Silver Millennium, their Queen and Princess, their 
very lives... all they had ever known was under attack. </pre>
