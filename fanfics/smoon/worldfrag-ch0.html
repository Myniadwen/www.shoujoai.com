<pre>There&#39;s a  reason I hide my heart
Out of sight out of mind
And when I find out just who you are
The door will be open for you to...
Find a way to my heart, and I will always be with you
&gt;From wherever you are, I&#39;ll be waiting
I&#39;ll keep a place in my heart, you will see it shinning through
So find a way to my heart, and I will, I will follow you.
						Phil Collins
Notes by the author:
I know that this song is quite old (about 12 years or so). But songs 
about love, about faith and about hope are timeless.

For this story there are no more comments necessary yet.

Prologue: Out of a dirty street

It stopped raining about two hours ago. Although it was very cold it 
became a wonderful afternoon after all the morning&#39;s mist. The last 
rays of the setting sun shone through the thick clouds.

A hole in heaven...

She stumbled over the slippery leaves that covered the pavement. With 
every step it got darker and she wondered if it was really so late. 
Her lover would be very angry and very concerned if she didn&#39;t come 
home right in time. 

She wanted to buy some cheese they forget yesterday. Today was 
Wednesday and they wanted to cook noodles, their daughter&#39;s favourite 
food. Although the little girl wasn&#39;t so good in eating the Italian 
food. She preferred it to throw it on the ground and to laugh happily.

Laugh happily...

She hold the bundle in her arms tighter as she tried to sped her 
steps. Her legs hurt but she didn&#39;t mention it. The trees near the 
road looked naked. Like grey ghosts they pointed up to the now almost 
dark sky. Wind played with messed short blonde hairs and a crumbled 
jacket. The jeans were dirty and the shoelace of her left shoes were 
open. She stumbled again but she felt too weak to curse.

Where&#39;s that...

Here green eyes looked for some seconds up from the dirty pavement she 
was walking on. She stopped in her motion and almost fell down on the 
ground. She fluctuate and blackness waited at the rim of her eyes. 
Slightly she shook her head and crossed the street. There weren&#39;t any 
cars here. Except a white one making a terrible loud sound. She wanted 
to shout at them. That they were too loud. That her head was going to 
explode. But she kept silent. Instead she squeezed the bundle in her 
arms and fought herself to go the few steps over to the big entrance. 
The staircase seemed to be as high as the highest mountain, but step 
by step, very slowly and very concentrated she climbed it.

I mustn&#39;t give up! I mustn&#39;t give up! I mustn&#39;t give up! 

She didn&#39;t know how many times she told herself that bloody lie but it 
was the only thought that bought her such a long way. Without just 
laying down near the road and dying.

No, I mustn&#39;t die. There&#39;s someone who needs help. Who needs me...

She swallowed hard as two men passed her by quickly. They carried a 
stretcher. She could hear some other men shout and other apparatus 
were carried to the groaning patient quickly. She could see the blood 
and she turned away not to threw up the rest that was inside of her. 
The rest she didn&#39;t threw up half an hour ago.

Is it just half an hour ago?

She leaned herself against the white hospital wall and listened to the 
shouts of the doctors that seemed to surround the patient. Maybe an 
accident. Or maybe something even worse.

Like me...

She blinked and only the bundle in her arms kept her from becoming 
unconscious.

Don&#39;t think of anything!

She trembled hard but didn&#39;t even mention it. She wanted to go over to 
the next doctor. To a nurse or simply to another human being. But 
suddenly she wasn&#39;t able any longer. She leaned against that wall and 
couldn&#39;t move her body. As if she was paralysed.

As if I am already dead...

Tears sparkled in dark green eyes as she felt the warm body pressed at 
her own one. The bundle in her arms moved slightly and she heard 
another groan. A high groan. A child&#39;s groan.

I mustn&#39;t give up!

&quot;Hello...&quot; she whispered and her voice sounded shaky. &quot;Hello?&quot; It 
seemed to take eternity until someone mentioned her. A nurse at the 
age of thirty came over to her and she could see her eyes growing big 
as she saw the dirty woman leaning against the wall that was almost as 
white as her face. The lips were swollen and she could only open one 
of her dark blue eyes any more. Her clothes were crumbled and as she 
moved into the light of the emergency room the nurse could see that 
the blue jeans were covered with blood.

Her own blood?

&quot;Oh my...&quot; The nurse blinked, then she remembered her apprentice ship 
and that this was her job. &quot;What happened?&quot; she asked and tried to 
touch the young woman. She was about twenty years old and for some 
moments the nurse had confused her with a man. But then she saw the 
breasts under the crumbled t-shirt. It was torn as if someone had 
grabbed and ripped it.

&quot;They attacked my daughter.&quot; Whispered the young woman and two tears 
run down her cheeks, leaving two white strands on the dirty cheeks. &quot;I 
fought against them, but I couldn&#39;t hinder that they beat her down. 
I...&quot; her voice broke and for the first time the nurse realized that 
the young woman was holding something tight. She removed the bloody 
jacket from it and the nurse looked terrified down at a small girl. 
Her dark black hairs were also messed and blood covered a surely 
beautiful face. She was maybe two years old, maybe even younger. And 
she was injured!

&quot;Doctor! This is an emergency!&quot; screamed the nurse and took the little 
girl from her mother&#39;s arms. The girl opened her dark eyes and started 
immediately to cry. At the next moment they were surrounded by men and 
women in white and quickly they carried the little girl away in one of 
the big, white rooms.

&quot;Hello, I am doctor Sagurasa. She&#39;s your daughter, ...?&quot;

Swollen dark green eyes looked up at a smiling face.

&quot;Ten&ocirc; Haruka .&quot; Whispered the young woman and stumbled backwards as 
the doctor tried to touch her. 

&quot;You should come with me. You look as if you had a really bad fight 
yourself, Ten&ocirc;-san.&quot; The doctor, she was maybe forty years old, took 
carefully the young woman&#39;s arm and felt how much she trembled.

Hai, it was a bad fight.

Haruka looked away as she stumbled over the emergency hall into 
another white room.

And I lost it...

&quot;But I am feeling fine.&quot; Protested the senshi of wind weakly and 
coughed as blood run from her nose into her mouth and took her for 
some seconds her breathe. The doctor watched her and slightly shook 
her head. An understanding expression laid on her face. And a sad 
knowing one at the same time.

&quot;What about my daughter? What about Himme-chan?&quot; Haruka sat down at 
chair and closed her eyes for some moments, ignoring the pain that 
went through her whole body.

&quot;She&#39;ll be fine, believe me. Little girls are strong.&quot;

Hai, Hotaru had been strong, but I had been weak...

&quot;Is there anybody I can call for you? Who needs to know that you&#39;re 
here? Maybe your husband or...&quot;

Michi-chan...

Haruka looked up and a terrified expression laid in her eyes that made 
even the doctor shiver who had seen a lot in her carrier. The young 
woman clenched her fists and the doctor believed to know what was 
going behind the blonde strands. She didn&#39;t want to exchange with the 
young woman.

&quot;Hai...&quot; whispered Haruka and lowered her head again. For the first 
time she saw the blood that covered her blue jeans to the knees. For 
the first time she remembered what happened the past few hours. For 
the first time after she left that dirty street in the inner City of 
Tokyo to take her daughter to the hospital she felt really sick.

Really dirty...

&quot;My girlfriend&#39;s at home and prepares our dinner. I... we wanted to 
take some cheese...&quot; said the senshi of the wind with a cold, almost 
insensible voice. For some seconds she wondered why the doctor didn&#39;t 
gasp for breathe. As the most people did when they recognized that she 
wasn&#39;t a boy. That she loved a girl. That they both adopted their 
daughter to raise her together as a loving, lively family.

What will Michi-chan thinks...?

&quot;I... I have to go now...&quot; stammered Haruka and tried to rise from her 
chair.

Michi-chan mustn&#39;t ever get to know about it!

&quot;I... I have....&quot;

I mustn&#39;t give up!

Haruka looked up as the doctor tried to hold her back. Then the world 
started to swirl around her and it got darker and darker with every 
second.

&quot;Michi...&quot;

Haruka collapsed with a sigh on the white room&#39;s ground as she gave in 
her weak body. Her pain and her dizzy feelings.

***

The bed was narrow and hard. Every bone hurt in her body and she 
wondered if her legs and her arms were broken. Her face burned like 
hell and the headache awoke when she tried to open her eyes. Her mouth 
was dry and it hurt to breathe.

I mustn&#39;t give up!

She opened her eyes and blinked in the lights that hang on a white 
ceiling. A ceiling she didn&#39;t know. At home there were pictures 
overall - even at the ceiling. Michiru had been so crazy to draw them 
when they papered the light house by the sea two years after Haruka 
moved into it.

Just some months before we adopted our Himme-chan. 

&quot;Hotaru! Princess!&quot; She tried to sit upright. To leave the bed. To go 
out of the corridor. To ask the doctors there who her daughter was 
feeling. But two arms held her back. Two soft, but determined hands 
pushed her carefully back into the pillow and she oppressed a groan as 
the pain increased inside her body.

&quot;Your daughter is feeling fine, Ten&ocirc;-san. She had a cut on her 
forehead and some bruises in her face, but in two or three days she&#39;ll 
be alright again. Don&#39;t worry, she&#39;s a little devil and she will be as 
wild as she had been before that... incident...&quot;

Haruka frowned as she heard a concerned tone in the doctor&#39;s voice. 
Slowly she turned her head and looked into knowing eyes.

&quot;Shall I call the police?&quot; asked the older woman directly and sighed 
as her patient only shook her head.

&quot;They didn&#39;t hurt the child, did they? They only hurt you.&quot; Again only 
a nod. It didn&#39;t look as if the young woman wanted to talk about it. 
&quot;Shall I call for a psychologist?&quot; Only a shook. Dark green eyes 
looked up at her but the doctor wasn&#39;t sure if she really saw her.

&quot;Did you call Kaioh Michiru?&quot; asked Haruka after a long while the 
doctor already thought she didn&#39;t want to talk to her.

&quot;Hai, she&#39;ll be here as soon as possible.&quot; Answered the doctor and 
smiled a concerned smile.

&quot;You really don&#39;t want to call...&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Haruka turned her head around and stared out of the window. She 
could see some branches touching the window pane. Moved by cold wind. 
Autumn was almost over and suddenly Haruka was very afraid of 
Christmas. The festival of love...

&quot;But...&quot;

I mustn&#39;t give up!

&quot;No, doc. Arigato, but that&#39;s my business. Not yours or that of the 
state.&quot; Answered the senshi of the wind with a very silent voice.

&quot;But...&quot;

Haruka turned her head back to her, looked up in her worried face and 
tried to smile up at her although every move hurt so much she wanted 
to scream. Slowly she raised her hands and touched with her icy hands 
the warm ones of the older woman.

&quot;Just do that test. I want to be sure that I won&#39;t ...&quot; her voice 
break and the doctor nodded understanding.

&quot;Of course.&quot; She whispered and felt so tiny. So bad, because she 
couldn&#39;t help that young woman. Although she wanted it so much.

I am a doctor. I am a goddess in white.

But even such a powerful goddess couldn&#39;t change the other&#39;s memories.

Or even the past.

&quot;If you need anything. Just call me.&quot; Said the doctor and Haruka was 
sure that she meant quite a lot more with her words. Not only her help 
as a doctor. But also her help as a woman.

&quot;Arigato...&quot;

At that moment the door was pushed open and a young woman crashed into 
the room. Her sea green hairs hang in her red face. She gasped hard 
for breathe and red spots covered an old pullover.

&quot;Ruka! Oh my god! I was so scared about you!&quot; shouted Michiru and was 
at the next moment at her lover&#39;s side. Haruka swallowed hard as she 
looked up into deep blue eyes she loved so much. As she felt the soft 
hand that reached tenderly for her icy one and started thoughtlessly 
to stroke it.

I mustn&#39;t give up!

&quot;Hope our dinner doesn&#39;t burn in the meantime. Gomen, I didn&#39;t buy the 
cheese.&quot; The senshi of the wind forced herself to smile a wild, tomboy 
smile. Michiru only sighed and suddenly tears were running down her 
cheeks.

&quot;You baka!&quot; She sighed again and sobbed desperately. &quot;I was so 
terrified when I got the phone call. I don&#39;t know how I should live on 
without you or our Himme-chan.&quot; Declared Michiru and put that icy hand 
that was connected to a drip up to her now wet cheeks and hold it 
tight.

Haruka swallowed hard and closed her eyes to enjoy that nice touch. 
And to forget the rough touches she had experienced just some hours 
ago.

I mustn&#39;t give up!

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;d never leave you, Michi-chan. Nor would Himme-chan.&quot; 
She managed to smile but couldn&#39;t look directly into her lover&#39;s eyes.

&#147;What happened?&#148; asked Michiru and choked oppressed.

&quot;Nothing happened, Michi-chan. Nothing special. I just had to beat 
down some guys. You know how I am.&quot; Haruka managed to laugh a thin, 
shaky laugh and felt how her lover squeezed her hand tighter.

The doctor shook sadly her head as she left the room to look after the 
daughter of that couple. She won&#39;t tell her the truth.

The older woman sighed and clenched her fists. The young woman didn&#39;t 
even blush when she lied to her girlfriend.

Hope she&#39;s strong enough to handle it all alone. Otherwise her 
memories will haunt her down until she&#39;s broken...
