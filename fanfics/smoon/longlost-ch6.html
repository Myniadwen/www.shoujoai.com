Last Time 

When all in the room heard a soothing voice say. &quot;All is well Sailors 
you will have your Princess back soon I just need to talk to her so 
please my friends do not worry.&quot; soon the Scout realized who the voice 
belonged to and it was none other than Queen Serenity.



Now On The Moon Kingdom

On the Moon instead of a barren wasteland like Serena thought she was 
going to see because she knew that the bright light and passing out was 
her mother&#39;s doing. There was a gorgeous Kingdom. It was full of life 
as if the Kingdom had never been attacked. Serena looked to her mother 
who was standing next to Serena and asked the question as to why the 
moon looked as if it had never been attacked. It was not as if she 
was not happy to see that her people were alive and happy. And she was 
filled with joy, with the fact that her mother from the Silver Alliance 
was not dead. When she heard two voices that belonged only to two 
people and she had been lead to believe that they both were dead. So 
she could not believe it when two men came out of the palace and up to 
her mother the older man coming to her and wrapping his arm around her 
while looking at Serena. The younger of the two coming to a stop beside 
Serena these men were none other than the King of the Sun Apollo, King 
husband to Queen Serenity and Serena&#39;s father and Serena&#39;s twin brother 
younger than her by ten minutes Travis. Travis being a mirror copy of 
Apollo just as Serena was almost the same as them both. Both had golden 
blond hair and sapphire blue eyes where Serena had blondish silver hair 
and bluish/silver eyes getting the silver part of both hair and eyes 
from her mother. [Poppa?] Serena asked unsure that what she saw before 
her was real and not a dream come true. [Yes my little Serenity it is 
I your father you are not dreaming, as I know you are thinking.] He 
chuckled and, with that he soon found himself in a bear hug with his 
daughter that he has not seen in over a thousand years. [Hey are you 
forgetting someone Serenity?] Said Travis, as he watched his sister 
hug the life out of their father. [How could I forget you my brother?] 
Serena said, 



Meanwhile with the Sailor Scouts 

&quot;So you mean to tell us that Endymion forced you to go to Beryl and 
that it is Endymion that is bad and not you?&quot; Said Raye with disbelief 
in her voice. &quot;I know that it&#39;s hard to understand that we&#39;re the good 
guys and that Endymion isn&#39;t but yes that&#39;s what we&#39;re saying.&quot; said 
Malachite just as he stopped talking there was another flash of silver 
light with a gold light following it. As Serena and three others made 
their appearance. Two men and what the Scouts and Generals knew to be 
the Queen Serenity. Serena and the Queen seemed to not mind the two 
others that were there. And come to think of it one of the men had an 
arm around the Queen and a younger copy of the man had an arm around 
Serena. When Amara saw this she got jealous that it was not her that 
had her arm around the woman that she loved. &#39;Why am I getting jealous? 
Kitten does not even know that I love her. I have got to talk to her 
so that I can tell her how I feel but how am I going to ask her?&#39; She 
asked herself as she was looking at Serena, the girl in question look 
right at Amara. &quot;Is there something on your mind Amara?&quot; Serena asked 
with a bit of concern in her voice. &quot;It can wait for a little while 
Serena but after this meeting you and I need to talk.&quot; &quot;Ok Amara.&quot; &quot;Ok 
everyone we need to get down to business first off who are you two?&quot; 
questioned Raye. &quot;I am Apollo and this is Travis I am Queen Serenity&#39;s 
husband and Serena as you call her and Travis&#39;s father.&quot; Said King 
Apollo. &quot;This can all be explained if you would sit down to answer the 
first question that is in your eyes yes the Moon Kingdom is back where 
it should be and the Earth is more then welcome to join the Silver 
Alliance.&quot; Said Queen Serenity as she looked at the four Generals of 
Earth. &quot;We are honored that you would let us in even after what we did. 
I think that I speak for the others when I say thank you.&quot; 

Right after the meeting, Serena left with Amara. She got into her car 
and they drove off. &quot;Would you like to go to my place?&quot; Amara asked 
her. &quot;Sure, I&#39;ve always wanted to see your place.&quot; Serena replied. 
Amara knew she had to tell Serena her true feelings for her. &#39;If I 
don&#39;t tell her now, it might be too late.&#39; She thought. Serena was 
wondering what Amara wanted to say to her. During the meeting, she 
couldn&#39;t focus on what was being said to her. &#39;Lately my heart skips 
a beat every time I see her. Could it be that I&#39;m falling for her?&#39; 
Serena thought. By now the car had reached it&#39;s destination. While they 
were in the elevator, Amara would look at Serena from the side of her 
eye. &#39;She&#39;s the most beautiful woman that I ever met.&#39; Amara thought. 
She fought back the urge to tear Serena&#39;s clothes off and make love 
to her right now. Amara opened the door and after Serena was in, she 
closed it. &quot;Is there anything that I can get you?&quot; She asked. &quot;No I&#39;m 
fine. Why don&#39;t you tell me what you wanted to say after the meeting?&quot; 
Serena replied.
