a bit of Mamo-bashing)


Setsuna couldn&#39;t breathe.

&quot;Minako?&quot; she whimpered. The blonde stood and walked to the trembling 
sorceress. &quot;I&#39;m here,&quot;she whispered, enveloping the tremblong woman in 
her arms. &quot;It&#39;s me.&quot;

&quot;H-how?&quot; Setsuna hiccuped. &quot;You were killed! I saw you--&quot; She closed her 
eyes against the painful memories. Minako sighed, her warm breath 
tickling Setsuna&#39;s neck.

&quot;I was killed,&quot; she began. &quot;But does the word, &#39;reincarnation&#39; ring a 
bell?&quot; Setsuna pulled back. Minako grinned. &quot;Yep. Twenty-five years of 
boring, human life, and one day, I&#39;m ordering a BigMac from Mickey D&#39;s 
when,&quot; she slapped her palms together. &quot;WHAMMO! I remember another 
twenty-five years of my life! Except back then I could do this&quot; With 
that, she grabbed the bullwhip that was attatched to her belt, and 
cracked it like an old pro.

&quot;Freakin amazing right!?&quot; she yelled like a kid at Christmas.

Setsuna stared. Then she groaned and buried her face in her hands.

&quot;Honey?&quot; Minako asked. &quot;You okay?&quot;

&#39;Damn you reincarnation...&#39; Setsuna grumbled in her mind.

This Minako was going to be the death of her. She just knew it. 
::::---::::

Rei sped down the streets with inhuman speed. If her senses were right, 
Usagi&#39;s powers had just woken up.

Meaning she was helpless.

Weak.

Ripe for the picking. Her fangs eleongated and slid over her lips. Red 
eyes flickered and danced like the flames she had loved when she was 
human. She was almost near the spot where Usagi&#39;s energy had flared, 
when a new scent reached her nose.

&#39;No...&#39; She stopped and raised her nose to the air. &#39;It&#39;s...him!!&#39; Icy, 
black rage flared in her heart. The human took over so suddenly, so 
quickly, the demon had no time to react.

Rei was lost in the haze of hatred. Fire pumped in her veins as she used 
her new inhuman speed and senses to track him down. Then she saw him.

Short black hair.

An average build.

Gentle blue eyes.

Rei roared and slammed into him with the force of a bullet train. He 
gasped as hands wrapped around throat.

&quot;You fucking bastard!&quot; Rei snarled. &quot;You son-of-a-bitch!! I&#39;ll kill 
you!!!&quot; The man who smelled so much like him gagged and scratched at her 
hands.

&quot;Like the effects of your curse!?&quot; she spat, half-way to the point of 
insanity. People had begun to gather, some men rushing forward to held 
him. Rei turned and bared her fangs.

They stopped immediatly.

&quot;Tell me! Tell me if your enjoying my new look!&quot; She growled and dragged 
her claws down his cheek. He whimpered and began to thrash underneath 
her.

&quot;Tell me Endyimon!!&quot;

&quot;My name is Mamoru!!&quot; he shrieked. Rei&#39;s thought processes shut down. 
&#39;Not Endyimon?&#39;

Her violet eyes flashed crimson.

&quot;You stink of his blood.&quot; she hissed. &quot;You may not be him,&quot; She raised 
her right hand, cracking her claws flexing them. &quot;but you are his 
descendent.&quot;

She plunged her hand through his chest, grinning with sick pleasure to 
hear a series of cracks and the feel of warm blood. Mamoru screamed and 
ruby red liquid tricked from his nose, from his mouth.

Rei&#39;s hand closed over his heart.

Mamoru shrieked.

With an animalistic growl, she ripped the still beating organ from the 
body, closing her eyes in bliss as the blood sprayed like a geyser and 
drenched her clothes, her hair, her skin.

The body jerked once, then lay still. Rei stood and turned her face to 
the sky. &quot;See this Endyimon!&quot; she roared. &quot;I&#39;ve kept my promise! I 
promised you that I would hunt you down to your last descendent and rip 
out his heart!&quot;

Rei gazed at the franticallty pumping organ in her hand.

She closed her fisted hand and grinned as the blood oozed and trickled 
down her arm.

&#39;Usagi,&#39; Violet became ruby once more. Human became demon. Rei became 
the Cursed One. &#39;I love you...&#39;

&quot;I love you,&quot; The demon cackled. &quot;To death...&quot; :::---:::

Usagi gasped and clutched her heart.

Makoto, the freed genie, paused in her act of nuzziling Ami&#39;s neck. 
&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s here! She&#39;s close!&quot;

&quot;So?&quot; Ami began as she fended off an overly affectionate Makoto. &quot;Just 
beat her down!&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;If this is because you still love her--&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have my full powers.&quot;

There was a pause.

&quot;Oh shit!&quot; :::---:::

Makoto grumbled. She was supposed to be free! She was supposed to be 
able to use her magic as she wanted!

&#39;So why am I flying a ten-thousand year old princess and a teacher 
around?&#39;

A soft brush skin, Ami&#39;s hand, passed over her arm lovingly.

&#39;Oh. That&#39;s why.&#39;

&quot;Just a little farther!&quot; Usagi yelled. &quot;I can feel the One of Magicks 
close by!!&quot; ::---:::

Setsuna perked up and dashed outside.

&#39;The Pure One...&#39;

The green haired sorceress looked in the sky and nearly passed out.

Usagi grinned nervously and waved.

&quot;Hello Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;Usagi!?!&quot; SEtsuna shrieked. How did her dear Usagi become the slayer of 
the Cursed One!? Minako chose that moment to dash out there

&quot;Honey what&#39;s--HOLY SHIT!!!&quot; The sight of a bored Makoto floating in mid 
air with a blue haired woman in one arm and a near replica of herseldf 
in the other was just a tad-bit too much.

There was a dull thump as Minako&#39;s body hit the sand.

Setsuna immediatly forgot about the floating Usagi and rushed to the 
prone body of her reincarnated lover.

&quot;Minako!!&quot; she gasped. &quot;What--mff!?!&quot; Minako had leaned up and captured 
Setsuna;s lips with her own. With a contented sigh, she broke the kiss 
and laid her head in Setsuna&#39;s lap.

&quot;Do you know how long I&#39;ve been waiting to do that?&quot; she mumbled.

&quot;About ten-thousand years.&quot;

&quot;Smart-ass.&quot;

Makoto raised an eyebrow. &quot;This is our back-up?&quot;

Ami sighed. &quot;We&#39;re doomed.</pre>
