Night was falling. One by one torches were being lit throughout the 
Castle of Jupiter. They glowed brightly in the dim shades of twilight 
that were closing in on the immense structure. Tonight the castle was 
bustling with activity. A feast was being held in honor of the newly 
enlisted soldiers. The great hall was alive with the sounds of music, 
singing, and the general loud banter of the crowd. In the middle of the 
room was a large table filled with just about every food imaginable. The 
soldiers ate and drank merrily, praising their princess. They were 
enjoying every moment of the celebration to the fullest for they knew 
that a hard road lay before them. One full of training and discipline.

At the head of the table, on a raised dais overlooking the room&#39;s 
activities, sat their leader. The Jovian Princess was in a foul mood 
this evening. The room&#39;s joyous atmosphere only added to her distaste. 
She lifted her seventh goblet of wine to her lips, consuming half of the 
contents.

To her left sat Captain Nephrite, looking to be in no better mood than 
the princess. To her right was an empty chair. Makoto scanned the room 
looking for its occupant. Shinozaki liked social occasions such as these 
and would rarely be seen sitting down in one place for extended periods 
of time. She finally spotted him standing by a few other men, who were 
laughing at something Shinozaki had just said. He then excused himself 
and started to make his way towards Makoto. Beside her, Nephrite scowled 
as he retrieved his goblet from the table.

&quot;Quite the social bug tonight, isn&#39;t he?&quot; Nephrite said coldly.

&quot;We all go about getting our information in different ways Captain. This 
is his way. He feels that knowing his men on a social level will help 
him to better train them. His methods have yet to fail, so I see no need 
to halt his actions.&quot; She spared Nephrite no glance as she downed the 
remainder of her wine. Lowering the goblet, she found Shinozaki standing 
before her.

&quot;Your Highness,&quot; he said, bowing.

&quot;Not quite yet actually...&quot; she answered. &quot;But give me a little while 
longer and I&#39;ll be as high as the tallest tower we&#39;ve got up there,&quot; she 
said, pointing at the ceiling.

Shinozaki half smiled. &quot;You are getting drunk Milady.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said flatly. &quot;And getting there is half the fun. Besides,&quot; 
she filled her goblet once more, &quot;This may be my last chance to do so in 
quite awhile. After tomorrow I&#39;ll be on my way to that...er...ball 
thing, or whatever it was.&quot; Makoto was finally beginning to feel the 
effects of the alcohol. She slouched in her chair and leaned heavily on 
one arm, looking at nothing particular in the hectic room. Shinozaki 
sighed and took his seat to her right. Once there he decided to try for 
some conversation.

&quot;Speaking of the Princess&#39;s birthday party. I understand that you 
already have the ship stocked and ready to pullout?&quot;

&quot;Of course! I&#39;ve already made all the necessary preparations for this 
accursed trip to the Moon. It should only take a little less than a week 
to get there.&quot;

&quot;So, you are completely ready to leave when the time comes? The 
provisions are on the ship...along with your wardrobe?&quot;

Makoto nodded.

&quot;You did make sure to pack both casual and formal?&quot;

Another nod was his answer.

&quot;And I&#39;m sure that you did not forget the Princess&#39;s present along with 
the small, but customary, presents to greet your fellow guardians?&quot;

Makoto suddenly became very interested in the contents of her goblet.

&quot;You forgot, didn&#39;t you?&quot; He asked while watching her gulp the entirety 
of the wine down.

Wiping her mouth lightly with the side of her hand she replied, &quot;Bah! 
Can&#39;t be thad hard canit? I&#39;ll find somethin&#39; lyin round here. It&#39;s the 
thought that counts and all ya know.&quot;

Shinozaki sighed impatiently. &quot;Yes, but I was hoping that you could put 
a little more than one thought into this, and preferably when you are 
not drunk.&quot;

&quot;Whaddaya mean drunk?! I can think just as fine right now as when I&#39;ve 
completed a full session of meditation. I could beat ten men right now 
even if ya blind folded me and didn&#39;t gimme no weapon. Hell, I could 
wipe the floor with ol&#39; Nephy over here!&quot; She japped her thumb over her 
shoulder in Nephrite&#39;s general direction. Nephrite scowled, but did not 
respond to her comment on making use of him as a mop, or the way she 
butchered his name.

Shinozaki ignored her protests. &quot;Princess, I cannot stress enough just 
how important it is to find a proper gift.&quot; He cast around for 
something, anything, that would convince her to take this a bit more 
seriously. &quot;The other guardians, it will be only proper for them to 
bring gifts as well. Would it not be wonderful if you were to bring a 
gift that rivals there&#39;s. You would not want the House of Jupiter to be 
the only one presenting the Princess with a less than amazing gift, 
would you?&quot; He knew how competitive the Jovian Princess was, so he hoped 
she would take this bate.

Makoto lifted her head in thought. She stayed that way for a few 
moments. Furrowing her brow she thought, &#39;How did it suddenly become so 
loud in here?&#39; &quot;I&#39;m goin&#39; for a walk,&quot; she announced suddenly. Refilling 
her goblet with the last of the wine, she rose from her seat. Making her 
way past Shinozaki, she headed for one of the side doors of the great 
hall.

Shinozaki watched her go, hoping he had convinced her. He thought that 
maybe she was going somewhere quieter to think. Probably one of the 
gardens. She always liked to go there to meditate sometimes. He knew 
that Makoto loved roses, and she kept a very large garden full of them. 
It contained just about every kind that was in existence. They imported 
the plants from Earth, and had them tended to night and day by a young 
boy whom she paid generously. She had a closer relationship with those 
very plants than she did with any living breathing thing. The roses 
outlasted any plant that would live on earth. They were enchanted to 
live for as long as she wished, and she would never let any of them die.

Makoto strode down the dark hall, running her free hand along the cold 
stone of the wall as she went. She did this mostly to keep herself 
walking in a straight line to her intended place of refuge. Though, 
having walked this path many times before, she could do it with her eyes 
closed on even the darkest night. Without the light of the torches. 
Meandering a little further, she stopped in front of big wooden door. 
Laying her hand upon the rough, worn surface, she pushed it forward on 
squeaky hinges. The sound echoed in the vast room in which she entered. 
Looking about, the princess smiled. The smile was not a smirk and it 
wasn&#39;t haughty. Her visage seemed to change just by being in that very 
room. All around her there were roses. Roses of every kind. It was 
peaceful here at the top of the castle. Lifting her face, she looked 
skyward. There was no ceiling in here. The dome that should have served 
as one had been removed many years ago. The light of the stars poured 
into the room, illuminating its occupant. The night air swirled around 
her, cooling her hot skin. Made so from the long trek she had taken to 
reach this haven. Makoto let out a great breath and sprawled onto the 
damp grass that carpeted the ground. She put her arm over her eyes.

&#39;What am I supposed to give her? All of them in fact...I&#39;ve never had to 
give anyone a gift before. I don&#39;t have much that anyone would want 
anyway. A bunch of old books, weapons, some rusty old suits of 
armor...maybe some statues and paintings.&#39; Her mind was getting a bit 
foggier. &#39;Who am I kidding? I don&#39;t own anything that a normal female 
would want. I gave up all that stuff ages ago.&#39; Makoto started to wish 
she hadn&#39;t finished off the goblet she had been carrying earlier. It was 
now sitting somewhere along the giant stairway she had used to get 
here.Fishing into the pocket of her trousers, she pulled out a small 
green stone. It was a habit she had developed. Bringing it out now and 
then and stroking the smooth surface with her thumb. It calmed her 
somehow, or so she liked to think. Laying her hand on her stomach and 
holding the emerald, the scents of the roses filled her head making her 
sleepy. Slowly she drifted off to sleep, surrounded by the comforting 
gaze of the roses.

The moment Makoto awoke, she knew she was not alone. Drowsy and 
disoriented, she lifted her head and then sat up completely. In fact, 
she sat up so fast that it jolted her aching head sending screaming 
pains rushing behind her eyes. &quot;Dammit!&quot; she snapped viciously. Jumping 
to her feet she got into a decent fighting stance and faced her enemy.

The Queen of the Negaverse stood before her in all her wicked glory. A 
knowing smile played across her chilled features. &quot;I see that I have 
caught you at a bad time your highness,&quot; she said mockingly.

&quot;Alright, bitch, I didn&#39;t think you were completely stupid. Now, though, 
I&#39;m convinced that you are. Ya think a little hangover&#39;s gonna stop me 
from kicking the shit out of ya!?&quot; The Jovian princess smirked in a 
triumphant way. &quot;Now then,&quot; she brought a hand out in front of her, 
letting small sparks of lighting dance between her fingertips, &quot;yer 
gonna gimme a good fight, right?&quot;

&quot;Oh, do not worry little girl. I will be happy to. Only, that can be 
rather hard considering I am not even here in your presence.&quot; Beryl 
laughed lightly at the confused expression on Makoto&#39;s face. &quot;I am 
projecting an image of myself to this spot from my castle. You cannot 
even touch me, so put away your toys and let us have a little chat.&quot;

Without warning, Makoto brought her fist straight into Beryl&#39;s 
face...and through it. She stumbled a bit ending up on the other side of 
the figure. &quot;Fuck, tonight just ain&#39;t my night,&quot; she said putting her 
hand to her throbbing head.

&quot;Done dear? Good. I have a proposition to make that you might find very 
interesting. It is my hopes that we might become good associates.&quot;

&quot;Eat shit...,&quot; was Makoto&#39;s spat reply.

&quot;My, we do have a foul mouth now, do we not? That matters not to me, 
however. I have little time to waste here. Do you not have someone that 
you hate even more than me anyway? Hmm, Makoto dear?&quot; Beryl smiled and 
held out her hand. Upon it stood the small figure of a handsome blond 
man.

Makoto lunged forward in a vain attempt to completely crush the small 
man. But he remained standing unfazed, and the queen laughed all the 
more.

&quot;This is merely another projection, girl. I will not simply hand him to 
you.&quot; Her tone of voice changed here. &quot;I did not order this man to kill 
your parents, you do realize this, do you not? He acted on his own, and 
it was an extremely stupid move. None defy me. I have been holding him 
in my castle for the last 12 years.&quot;

&quot;Ha! As if I&#39;d believe a lying whore like you!&quot; Makoto laughed her own 
cruel laugh. Then she regarded the small figure the queen held. He was 
the same man, there was no doubt about it. Looking at him now, she 
wanted to kill him. She wanted to torture and mutilate him. There were 
no words for the depths at which her hate for him ran. He was a murder 
who killed her parents and took away the only people she had ever 
loved...the only people she ever would love. If she killed him, then her 
revenge would be complete. No more searching, no more pain, no more 
agony of knowing that he was still alive and well. Makoto breathed 
deeply, she would do anything to get this man.

Beryl&#39;s face had taken on a mask of calm, observing the Jovian princess. 
Makoto lifted her head, and looking into Beryl&#39;s eyes said, &quot;What do you 
want in return?&quot;

Beryl maintained that same calm visage. &quot;You will become my General. 
Your people shall still be yours, but they will be under the protection 
of the Negaverse. The army shall also be yours, and you will combine it 
with your own Jovian one. The combination will be unbeatable. The 
strongest in the universe, and you shall be at its head.&quot;

&quot;Never.&quot; Was all that Makoto could say.

&quot;Come now, do not be unreasonable. Think on this. What have the other 
guardians ever done for you? They are not your friends, nor has any of 
them offered you aid.&quot;

&quot;I need no aid.&quot;

&quot;But of course you do not. You are one of the strongest warriors in the 
universe, otherwise I would be a fool for choosing you as my general.&quot;

&quot;I am not evil like you are. I will never hurt any of them. It is my 
duty to protect each and every one.&quot;

&quot;You do not owe this Kingdom anything, and there is no good and evil in 
war. We battle for our own causes. We are not so different, you and I.&quot;

Makoto cringed inwardly at hearing some of her own words repeated back 
to her.

&quot;Do you not wonder why you are being forced to come to this little gala. 
She wants to get you under her thumb, and she will hold you there. She 
probably thinks of you as a threat to be dealt with. No doubt she has 
noticed the increase in the size of your army. It would be prudent of 
you to be weary. A wolf may hide behind that pretty face of hers. At 
least my intentions are known, I can hardly imagine what hers must be.&quot;

&quot;Do not tell me what to do, or how to handle myself you witch. I need no 
one, least of all you. I can fight my own battles and win them alone.&quot; 
Makoto&#39;s voice was sharp with anger. She stood tall and proud, daring 
the Queen to question her strength.

Beryl&#39;s calm facade finally broke, she spoke forcefully. &quot;These things 
are all meaningless if you sit here in this castle for the rest of your 
life, rotting away to nothingness. You hold no love for the bastards of 
the Moon Kingdom, so why is this such a hard choice to make. Your 
parents died for them...for nothing.&quot;

Makoto was raging inside. She wanted to tear this woman&#39;s heart out and 
rip her to shreds. &quot;I hold no love for anyone and I never will again!&quot;

Beryl&#39;s stare was long and even. &quot;Then what exactly is the problem?&quot;

Makoto stared back at the woman with no response. She had a duty to 
protect the Moon Kingdom and its inhabitants. A duty given to she and 
the rest of the guardians by Queen Serenity. &#39;What do I owe that woman 
though? Why should I be bound to a duty without a choice?&#39;

&quot;Think on all that I have said today Princess of Jupiter,&quot; she held the 
small figure of the blond general close to Makoto&#39;s troubled face. &quot;I 
shall await your answer eagerly. Until we meet again.&quot; She bowed her 
head slightly and dissolved from the rose garden.

Makoto stood in silence contemplating. She felt very exhausted. The 
world began to spin around her and her knees started to give way. 
Falling, her weight hit the soft ground with an audible thud. The last 
thing she saw before everything went black, was a pair of small booted 
feet running toward her.

Several minutes later, on a stone slab not far from where she passed 
out, Makoto awoke to the feel of cold water being applied to her flushed 
face. Opening her dark green eyes she met small brown ones. Thin arms 
helped her to sit up. She pushed them away hastily and propped herself 
up on her own. &quot;Shingo, how long have I been out?&quot;

&quot;Not very long at all your Highness.&quot; He said respectfully. &quot;I found you 
on the ground, yonder.&quot; Makoto looked in the direction he had indicated. 
On the ground she saw something sparkle, just barely visible in the wet, 
green grass. Standing she went to retrieve the object. Feeling its loss 
from her person as a physical thing. Like an appendage. Picking the 
emerald up, she stroked it unconsciously. Makoto regarded Shingo again. 
The young thirteen year old was still sitting on the slab a few feet 
away.

&quot;Would Milady be needing anything? Water? Some wine?&quot; he asked.

&quot;No thank you Shingo. I think I&#39;ve had my fill of wine for the night.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s almost morning Milady.&quot;

&quot;Well then, I&#39;ll need to be getting to bed then.&quot;

&quot;Good morning then Milady.&quot;

Makoto started to walk slowly towards the door, all of the events of the 
night rushing back to her as she progressed. &#39;I must do something about 
these thoughts that are plaguing me!&#39; her mind screamed. Her hand 
stilled in its stroking of the emerald she held. Several things seemed 
to fall into place at once. Turning on her heal quickly, she retraced 
her steps to the slab. Grabbing a very surprised Shingo by the collar, 
she brought him to his feet.

&quot;You Highness?!&quot; He squeaked in surprise.

&quot;You&#39;re coming with me Shingo,&quot; she smirked delightedly. &quot;And go grab 
those shears from the back storage. I need to gather some presents.&quot; 
Makoto released the bewildered Shingo, who ran off somewhere towards the 
back of the large room. The Jovian princess looked up once again at the 
night sky, the stars were beginning to slowly disappear and dawn drew 
near. Smiling she traversed the ground to the roses and began to make 
her way deeper into the immense garden, all thoughts of sleep gone from 
her mind.</pre>
