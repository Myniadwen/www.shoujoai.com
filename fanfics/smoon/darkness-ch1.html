<pre>THE BEGINNING

Today was the beginning of all the pain. The horrors and death that me 
and brothers had to live through. My name is Serena Moon, as my 
brothers are Jet and Tray Moon. I was six years old at the time as my 
brothers were 7, and yes people they are twins.

It was a Saturday evening when we were on our way home from a picnic. 
It was so much fun! You know, we aren&#39;t your average family. We never 
was. You see my father is a vampire as my mother is a mortal or shall 
I say human.

My brothers and I are half vampire and half human. So we are very 
different form any of the normal vampires. But first off let&#39;s get one 
thing straight. 1) Holy water and crosses don&#39;t affect us! I even were 
a cross to prove my point. 2) We are can be in daylight. and 3) All 
vampires are not bad.

You see in the daylight we look normal. We eat normal foods and drink 
normal things. My brothers and I go to school as my dad goes to work 
and my mother stays home to clean and cook. But at night were are 
different.

We are like all the other vampires. My daddy goes out for his &#39;hunts&#39;. 
At the time my brothers and I didn&#39;t know what that meant. My mom gave 
us blood, but it wasn&#39;t human blood. It was actually pig&#39;s blood. We 
grew up on it so it didn&#39;t taste all that bad. A little bitter, but 
sugar fixed that right up.

My brothers and I weren&#39;t allowed to drink from humans. My mother 
didn&#39;t want us to kill humans in order for us to eat. I can see why, 
since she was a human. My dad never drank the pig&#39;s blood. My mother 
tried to get him on it but he didn&#39;t like it since he grew up on human 
blood.

Anyway, I was holding my daddy&#39;s hand when we were on our walk home 
when we saw a couple of people coming towards us. It wasn&#39;t anything 
unusual to me. We see people every day. But one of the men came up to 
my father with a wooden stick. Another guy grabbed my mother from 
behind and held her tightly.

I looked on in confusion as did my brothers. My brothers who were next 
to me grabbed me and pulled me to the side when the man who had the 
stick punched my father in the face. We watched in horror as we saw 
the man bring the stick down to his heart. My father turned into a 
pile of ashes as I heard my mother scream.

Me and my brothers didn&#39;t shed one tear. We were taught that crying 
was a weakness in our trainings with our father. My attention turned 
from the dust to my mother when she screamed for us to run. My 
brothers dragged me along in their run and told me not to look back.

I let a sign of weakness show when I let a tear drop. I heard my 
mother scream in pain as she was killed. I couldn&#39;t believe my parents 
were dead. I swore to myself that I will avenge their deaths and make 
them suffer. This was far from over.

Soon we made it to our house but there were people surrounding it. We 
past by like we never saw the place in our entire lives. We ran from 
the horrors, our home, and from our once loved lives. We made it to an 
alleyway and prepared ourselves to sleep their. I sat in the middle of 
my brothers as they held me tightly. I soon fell asleep along with Jet 
and Tray.

****************

We stayed in that place for three days. My brothers would take turns 
in going out and stealing food for me and themselves. But I wasn&#39;t 
hungry for normal food as was they. We were hungry for blood. When 
ever we were hungry for blood, our eyes would turn a rich green color. 
And when we were starving for it our eyes would turn an eerie blood 
red.

Our eyes was just about that color of the red. And when our eyes were 
that color our fangs would automatically reveal itself. I felt like I 
was going to lose my mind if I didn&#39;t have some blood.

I was startled out of my thoughts when I saw someone coming down the 
alley. It was some girl who looked like she was paranoid. She kept 
looking behind her as if she was being followed. I was getting some 
strange vibes on attacking her. But that was against my teachings.

Suddenly I saw a dark shadowy figure jump off of a building and 
lightly touch the ground with out a sound. He walked up behind the 
girl and grabbed her. The girl shrieked in terror as the man held her 
tightly. I hugged my brother Jet tightly as I watched what happened to 
the girl.

I was surprised when I saw the man bring out his fangs and pierce it 
into the lady&#39;s neck. The girl screamed out in pain which soon died 
down to nothing. The man dropped the women and wiped his mouth with 
the sleeve of his shirt. He turned towards us and advanced his way 
over.

I shrinked down into my brother&#39;s arms as I felt him shake with fear. 
I felt my other brother Tray wrap his arms around me for protection. 
The man walked up to us and looked down upon us. He smiled down at as 
which wasn&#39;t comforting at all. It only made up shrink back in fear 
even more.

He silently brought out his hand and made a &#39;come here&#39; gesture. He 
sighed in frustration when we didn&#39;t move an inch.

&quot; Will you three please come here, I&#39;m not going to hurt you.&quot;, he 
said in a calm voice. I looked at my brothers and reached out for his 
hand. There was something about him I could trust. I didn&#39;t listen to 
my brothers cry of protests either.

When I held his hand he didn&#39;t do anything. Soon my brothers joined 
in. He told us to follow him and we did as we were told. Soon we met 
up with a couple of people. They were both girls. One had aqua colored 
hair and matching eyes. The other girl had sandy blonde hair cut 
shortly like a boy&#39;s. She also had light green eyes.

The aqua haired girl smiled down at us as they other girl glared. The 
three people began talking quietly as we continued our walk. Soon we 
made it to a truck and he told us to climb in. Me and my brothers were 
weary at first but than we climbed in.

I had some trouble getting in the truck but then the girl that glare 
at us pick me up and place me in the truck. Once we were seated, all 
of us just sat quietly throughout the whole ride.</pre>
