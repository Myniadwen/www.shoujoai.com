<h1>Mamorue Must Die! (part 6 of 35)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>A video camera is turned on, and the surroundings flew by the screen as 
the amateur filmmaker moved it around, finally aiming it at her own 
smiling face.

&quot;Hey guys,&quot; the cheerful blond said, &quot;Minako here with my video camera. 
Since this series of omakes started, it has become surprisingly popular. 
Therefore, I thought you&#39;d like a peek behind the scenes.

The scene suddenly changed to a behind the scenes cafeteria.

&quot;...and that&#39;s another thing.&quot; Makoto griped as she sat at the table 
across from Ami, &quot;Character development. There&#39;s no character 
development in any of these damn stories! We&#39;re just there as plot 
devices while Mamoru gets killed and Rei winds up with Usagi.&quot;

&quot;Yeah but Mako-chan, it&#39;s not like we have much of a choice in the 
matter.&quot; Ami answered, &quot;There&#39;s bills to pay, remember? There&#39;s not 
going to be a sixth season, so it&#39;s either this or the car show circuit 
again.&quot;

&quot;I know love, but...&quot;

&quot;You know,&quot; Haruka put in from the table she and Michiru were sitting 
at, &quot;I was going to stay out of this whine-fest of yours, but come on! 
For the amount of money we&#39;re getting paid to appear in this fanfic 
series I hardly think you have room to complain miss &#145;I&#39;m an actress, 
where&#39;s my motivation in this scene where Mamoru gets gored&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Makoto asked angrily, &quot;Well, there are plenty of fans out 
there of the Usagi and Haruka pairing; how about we change the series to 
&#145;Michiru Must Die&#39;?&quot;

Michiru spit out the water she was drinking while Haruka frowned at 
Makoto. The tomboy then looked over and noticed Minako.

&quot;Minako! Are you taping this?&quot; she asked angrily, &quot;Knock it off now or 
I&#39;ll shove that camera up your...&quot;

Suddenly the camera started moving wildly, eventually falling upon 
Minako&#39;s face as she ran desperately from Haruka&#39;s clutches.

&quot;Er... Okay gang, and now, on with the next omake.&quot;

&quot;Come back here you blond bimbo, I&#39;ll...&quot;

---Omake Six: Jailbait---

Usagi sat nervously in front of her parents, her boyfriend Mamoru and 
her closest friend among the Senshi Rei sitting with her on the couch to 
offer their support.

&quot;So that... That&#39;s it mom and dad. You see, I&#39;m Sailor Moon, and my 
friends are actually the Sailor Senshi.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s mother looked over to her husband, then back to Usagi, &quot;Well, 
while we&#39;re less than thrilled about the idea of you running around 
fighting these &#145;youma&#39; things, we do support you.

Rei smiled, &quot;See Usagi. I told you your parents would be behind you. 
They&#39;re wonderful folks; I knew that the first time I met your mother. I 
don&#39;t see what you were so nervous about.&quot;

Both parents beamed with pride.

&quot;Thank you very much young lady.&quot; Usagi&#39;s father said. It was then the 
patriarch of the family noticed Mamoru sitting on the couch with the two 
girls. &quot;And you must be Rei-chan&#39;s older brother, I...&quot;

Mamoru shook his head, &quot;Actually no, I&#39;m Usagi&#39;s...&quot;

&quot;Teacher?&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother asked, &quot;Tutor?&quot;

&quot;No ma&#39;am, me and Usagi are dating, and...&quot;

&quot;You WHAT?&quot; Mrs. Tsukino shrieked. Usagi&#39;s dad narrowed his eyes.

&quot;Exactly how old are you, young man?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m twenty, but...&quot;

&quot;Twenty?&quot; Mr. Tsukino asked in shock, &quot;Twenty? A twenty year old man is 
having romantic liaisons with my precious little fifteen year old 
daughter?&quot;

&quot;Daddy wait,&quot; Usagi jumped in, &quot;It&#39;s not like that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Mamoru put in, &quot;You see, we&#39;re going to be the future king and 
queen, and our daughter will...&quot; Mamoru&#39;s voice drifted off as Usagi&#39;s 
father stood up from his seat, went to his closet, and pulled out a 
shotgun.

&quot;Punk,&quot; the elder Tsukino growled, &quot;I&#39;m giving you &#145;till the count of 
three before I start blasting!&quot;

Mamoru jumped up from the couch in a panic and ran outside, Usagi&#39;s 
father in hot pursuit. Inside the house, Usagi and Rei both jumped when 
they heard the sound of gunfire coming in from outside.

&quot;Mom!&quot; Usagi pleaded, &quot;You have to stop them. Dad will kill him!&quot;

Her mom just shook her head, &quot;You know, I can accept your fighting 
monsters, being the reincarnation of a Moon Princess, and time travel, 
but this?&quot;

Both young women looked nervously up as Usagi&#39;s father came back in, 
smoke rising from his shotgun.

&quot;Well that took care of him.&quot; Mr. Tsukino said grimly. Usagi lost all 
the color in his face.

&quot;Daddy?&quot; she asked, &quot;Tell me you didn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;No, of course not.&quot; he answered, &quot;I fired over his head. He was so 
scared though that he ran into an open manhole.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Rei said nervously, &quot;This may not be the best time, but I have a 
little confession to make.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Usagi&#39;s mother asked suspiciously?

&quot;Yes. You see, I&#39;m a lesbian, and I think I&#39;ve fallen in love with your 
daughter.&quot;

The silence in the already tension-filled room became palpable. Finally, 
Usagi&#39;s over-protective father spoke up.

&quot;How old are you?&quot; he asked pointedly.

&quot;Fifteen, same as your daughter.&quot; she answered nervously.

&quot;Good!&quot; Mr. Tsukino answered with a smile, &quot;I&#39;m glad to hear you&#39;re not 
another cradle robbing pervert like that Mamo-jerk I ran out of here.&quot;

Usagi was flabbergasted, &quot;Wha... But... But you... But... Dad, she&#39;s a 
girl!&quot;

&quot;And a very charming one too.&quot; Usagi&#39;s mom put in.

Mr. Tsukino addressed Rei, &quot;You have my permission to date my daughter, 
provided you bring her home at a reasonable hour.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Usagi asked incredulously, &quot;But... But...&quot;

&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Rei asked, &quot;What are you so upset about?&quot;

&quot;What am I so... WE&#39;RE BOTH GIRLS!&quot;

&quot;So? You were attracted to Haruka weren&#39;t you?&quot;

&quot;Well, well yeah, but I thought she was a...&quot;

&quot;You thought she was a boy and became attracted to her so that later, 
when you found out he was a she you became freaked out, right? Well, you 
already know I&#39;m a girl, so there&#39;s no problem with us dating, see?&quot;

Usagi was dumbfounded; there was a hole in Rei&#39;s logic somewhere, but 
she was having a hard time pinpointing it.

&quot;Um... Okay, I guess.&quot; she said tentatively.

&quot;Terrific!&quot; Usagi&#39;s father said, &quot;Tell you what; here&#39;s fifty yen. You 
two crazy kids go out and have some fun.&quot;

Usagi just shook her head in shock, &quot;I... I&#39;m in the Twilight Zone.&quot; she 
mumbled.

&quot;Don&#39;t fight it, love.&quot; Rei purred as she took the dumbstruck blonde&#39;s 
hand and led her out of the house.
