<h1>Enchante (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Michiru hesitated as she touched the door handle. Her arms were full 
of groceries, as were mine. Her eyes became unfocused, then just as 
quickly, returned to the present.

&quot;Michiru? What is it?&quot; I moved closer to her.

&quot;Nothing.&quot; She lowered her voice. &quot;I thought I felt something, a 
presence...but there&#146;s no sense of evil.&quot; She shrugged the bags into a 
more comfortable position and turned the key.

I reached for the light switch as I entered, and she followed right 
behind me, closing the door as she passed through.

I flipped on the light and came to an abrupt stop. Michiru dropped her 
bags and gasped.

Sailor Venus stood in the middle of the apartment, a Venus Love Me 
Chain dangling from her hand. The delicate golden links tinkled with a 
unearthly noise as they made lazy swirls on the carpet.

I stood and stared, trying to think of something to say.

&quot;Well?&quot; she demanded, at last.

&quot;Well, what?&quot; I stuttered, completely taken aback. It&#39;s not often I 
lose my composure, but it&#39;s not often that I&#146;m taken completely by 
surprise either. Michiru&#146;s intuition had been right on both accounts, 
there was a presence and she wasn&#146;t evil - well not terribly evil, 
anyway. I knew why she was here. I could envision her standing in the 
audience at the Affection Degrees Contest, crying &quot;Haruka-san look at 
me!&quot; and picture her and Usagi following me with what they evidently 
regarded as stealth. I suppressed a smile.

&quot;Well,&quot; she said impatiently, as if I was a slow child, &quot;What is it 
going to take to get you to notice me? How many times do I have to ask 
you to look at me?&quot; Her voice rose, but did not become shrill. I 
opened my mouth to answer, but the spark in her eyes stopped me.

&quot;Don&#146;t make me use this....&quot; Her grin was as evil as anything I&#146;d ever 
seen. She brandished the Chain in our direction.

Michiru, still not quite sure of an appropriate reaction, took a step 
back towards the door. Venus reacted so quickly I barely had time to 
let my bags of groceries fall to the floor. A moment later I found my 
arms tightly bound to my side. Looking over at Michiru, I could see 
that the Love Me Chain held her firmly in place as well.

Venus approached, still grinning. &quot;Well?&quot; She detransformed as she 
walked towards me, ending up directly in front of me. Minako-chan was 
wearing a light blue dress that nearly matched the color of her eyes. 
She turned her back to me and gathered up her hair, lifting it to bare 
her neck and the dress&#146;s zipper.

I glanced a bit wildly at Michiru. She knows how helpless I am in the 
face of that gesture. She gave an almost imperceptible smile and I 
turned back to Minako.

&quot;I&#146;d be glad to but...&quot; I shrugged my arms still bound by the Chain. 
In a second, the Chain disappeared. I lifted my free hands and placed 
them on her back. I leaned into her hair and whispered. &quot;Surely 
Michiru doesn&#39;t have to stand here and watch this? Won&#146;t you let her 
go?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Michiru said, in the oddest tone of voice I&#146;d ever heard her 
use. &quot;I&#146;d like to stay.&quot; Something in her voice made me shiver, and it 
did Minako, as well. I could see goosebumps rise all over Minako&#146;s 
shoulders. 

The Chain released Michiru and she advanced, while I began to unzip 
Minako&#146;s dress. I am not kidding when I say that the act of baring a 
neck makes me helpless. Michiru has, one more than one occasion, used 
that gesture to end an argument. I leaned down and very gently placed 
a kiss on Minako&#146;s neck, while drawing the zipper of her dress lower. 
She shivered ever so slightly and as my kiss lingered, leaned her head 
back. I continued to kiss her on the neck, as the zipper reached its 
nadir. I felt the dress being pulled down over her shoulders. Michiru 
was lending a hand. I looked up over Minako&#146;s shoulder and met 
Michiru&#146;s eyes. Taking one of her hands, I kissed the palm, then let 
go. She smiled and turned to the girl in between us. Returning to 
Minako&#146;s neck, I kissed a trail down her spine, parting the dress and 
sliding it away from her. I could feel her moan slightly, as Michiru 
leaned forward and kissed her at the base of the throat. I smiled - I 
do that too, when Michiru kisses me there.

I finished sliding the dress across Minako&#146;s body and with a final 
slither, it fell to the ground. She now stood between us, clad in 
camisole and panties, looking every inch the magnificent creature she 
was. Her body was lithe and athletic - a dancer&#146;s body. I ran one hand 
under the camisole and around her ribs, while nipping at her shoulders 
and neck. I could feel her trembling, as Michiru kissed her deeply. 
For a moment, I stopped, simply to watch these two beautiful women as 
they kissed. Minako&#146;s&#146; hands covered Michiru&#146;s, which cupped Minako&#146;s 
face. Minako slipped one arm around Michiru&#146;s neck and I held my 
breath at the sight.

I slipped my second hand under the camisole and across Minako&#146;s 
abdomen. Slowly, I caressed the area beneath her breasts, not yet 
touching them. This is the softest area on a woman&#146;s body and deserves 
some attention of its own. I drew my hands back to where her breasts 
just began and ran my hands underneath them, cupping them lightly. I 
could feel Minako rumble with pleasure and lifted one finger on each 
hand, to just barely brush her nipples. With a gasp, Minako broke the 
embrace between her and Michiru, throwing her head back. Michiru 
lowered herself slightly and began to kiss the area above the 
camisole&#146;s lace trim. I could see her drawing her tongue slowly across 
the top of Minako&#146;s cleavage, sometimes letting it probe a little 
deeper. I moved into Minako&#146;s neck and gently fastened my teeth on 
her. Once again her head lolled back and once again, I let my finger 
brush her nipples. She leaned into me and moaned, thrusting her chest 
forward. I let my fingers roll her lovely soft nipples and reveled in 
the sounds she was making, now a gasp, now a cry. I took my mouth, 
then my hands away and Minako whimpered at the loss.

Looking at Michiru, I lifted Minako in my arms and walked with her to 
the center of the room. Michiru walked swiftly over to the lacquered 
cabinet and removed our futon from it. She laid it out and I laid 
Minako gently down upon it. The girl seems lost in a haze of pleasure, 
but her eyes opened as I leaned over her. She smiled - a slow, 
seductive smile that sent a chill through me. I looked up at Michiru, 
who answered that smile with one of her own. Michiru removed her 
clothes, then my tie, with alacrity. I opened the collar of my shirt, 
but did not remove it.

When I looked back at Minako, she was watching Michiru undress with 
interest. I decided to give her something more interesting to focus on 
and kissed her hard on the mouth. Her tongue met my own, fighting for 
supremacy. I let her win, and she explored my mouth, while I explored 
other parts of her. My hands had once again found her breasts, but I 
wanted more. I broke away from our kiss, and brought my mouth to one 
nipple. My hand still controlled the other, but it was brushed away by 
Michiru, who took the other nipple for her own. Together we removed 
the camisole, and together we began to suck at Minako, supporting her 
with one hand behind her back, one hand on her stomach, mouths firmly 
over her breasts.

If you haven&#146;t experienced that sensation, than I can&#146;t describe it 
fully. Hard and soft, warm and cold. Minako thrashed as we nursed on 
her. Michiru took her mouth away and swiped quickly at Minako&#146;s mouth 
with her tongue, The girl practically rose off the ground to get at 
Michiru, but laughing, my lover had disappeared back down to her 
chest. Michiru lifted herself, and taking one of Minako&#146;s&#146; hands, had 
the girl take one of her own breasts. The Michiru lowered herself to 
the waiting mouth. Minako pinched her own nipple and moaning, devoured 
Michiru&#146;s breast. I took one look at the thrashing hips below me and 
knew what I wanted most.

I slid Minako&#146;s underwear off, and lifted her slightly, discarding 
them over my shoulder. Minako was hot enough not to care what she 
looked like, and her pelvis pounded upwards, seeking some kind of 
release. I slid my hands down from her navel and ran them over the 
blonde mound in front of me.

&quot;Beautiful,&quot; I sighed and separated my hands, opening her up. I kissed 
her once, twice and three times, softly, slowly and lingeringly on her 
clit, then, very gently, let my tongue roll around it. I drew my 
tongue upwards in broad motions, which made her respond with a muffled 
moan. Then I drew my tongue down, across her labia, and into the 
center folds of her cunt. When I entered her, she bucked and I could 
hear her cry out, but I no longer cared about her. I only wanted to 
taste her, feel her in my mouth. My tongue ran lightly across her clit 
again and again, until I could feel her tensing. I brought one hand up 
and played with her wetness, coating myself in it. I slid my fingers 
into her gently until they were in as far as they could go. I looked 
up and caught sight of Michiru taking Minako&#146;s hand and entering 
herself with it. I brought my own hand out again and slammed it back. 
Minako lurched upwards with a shriek, as Michiru fingered herself. 
Minako had one hand on her own breast, pinching and pulling and the 
second hand was lost between Michiru&#146;s legs. 

I returned my mouth to Minako&#146;s clit and began to brush slowly over 
it, again and again. As her thrusts upwards increased, so did my 
tempo. I could feel her rising tension and moved my hand inside of her 
to coincide with the thrusts, entering her harder and deeper, until I 
was pounding into her. Minako began to thrash her head back and forth 
and I renewed my efforts, speeding up. Her abdomen tensed and her 
body, oblivious of anything but its own need, drew my fingers in 
deeply. I thrust into her and kept my tongue moving. All at once she 
screamed, a scream I have heard before and delight in. A scream of 
primal energy and desire. With that scream I also heard Michiru, now 
adding her own orgasm to Minako&#146;s, as the girl thrust hard into her.

I kept licking Minako until the tension subsided, until her chest 
relaxed and her back fell from its arched position and her hand 
dropped limply from Michiru. I lifted my head to look at the both of 
them, flushed and breathing hard. I was so wet I could barely think 
straight, but there was no way I was going to force myself on the 
girl. Michiru, on the other hand.... I smiled.

I got to my knees and crawled over to where Michiru kneeled. She 
smiled at me and lifted her hands to my shoulders. She licked Minako&#146;s 
juices off of my face and kissed me. 

&quot;Mmmmmm....&quot; she took my fingers in her hand and slowly dragged her 
tongue over each one, cleaning them seductively. I kissed her, tasting 
Minako in her kiss. We kissed deeply, until I felt something tugging 
at my shirt. 

I looked down to find Minako, practically panting with her need to get 
to me. She looked up and growled, &quot; Get it off.&quot; 

Michiru laughed at the look on my face. She unbuttoned the shirt and 
she and Minako removed it and the T-shirt underneath it. The next 
thing I knew I was flat on my back, and Michiru was pulling at my 
belt. I tried to assist, but Minako had pinned my hands over my head 
and was now sucking at me, teasing me with her tongue. I began to moan 
and she grinned at me ferally. Her teeth scraped across my nipples, 
dragging at them. 

Michiru had gotten my pants off and parted my legs. I braced myself, 
but nothing happened. I looked up to see Minako and Michiru watching 
me from under lowered lids. They sat at either side of me and just 
watched. I looked at both of them and waited. Nothing...

&quot;Please.&quot; I begged, all pride lost in desire. Minako brought one hand 
down between my legs and opened me. I gasped and my eyes rolled back 
in my head. At least ten hands touched me then, teasing me, drawing 
wetness out of me and spreading it on me. My head was whipping from 
side to side with the exquisite torture of it. I lost all power of 
speech as Minako entered me, while Michiru&#146;s tongue played across my 
clit. Hands on my breasts, inside of me, tongues teasing, when I came 
I called out for both of them, begging and pleading for them not to 
stop.

We lay for a while, the three of us, intertwined, letting that dreamy 
feeling one gets come upon us. We may have even slept. When I sat up 
again, I could see green hair and blonde caught together in the 
setting sunlight. I kissed each of them gently and rose. I pulled on 
my shirt and went into the kitchen to make tea.

When I returned with the tray, Minako sat with Michiru, both dressed, 
both looking for the world like nothing had happened, except for the 
slight flush in their faces. We had tea and chatted inconsequentially 
for a little while. It was just getting dark when Minako rose and 
politely excused herself, saying she had to go home.

She put one hand on the door and paused. She turned and with a smile 
asked, &quot;So? Which one of you picked me?&quot;

Both startled, we looked up at her, unsure what to say. 

&quot;Come on, out with it. Which one of you knew it would be me first?&quot; I 
pointed at Michiru, who smiled brightly. Minako smiled back at her and 
winked. &quot;Thank you for paying such lavish attention to me today.&quot; she 
said to us, and bowed. She turned, opened the door and walked out, 
never looking back.
