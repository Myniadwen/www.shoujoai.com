<h1>Gravity of Love (part 12 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Serena rolled over on the large bed. The sheets were soft and smooth... 
silk. It was different from her warm and comfortable cotton ones. And 
the blanket... what was that smell? Jasmine? Vanilla? It&#39;s familiar...

Blue eyes snapped open once she realized why.

&quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot;

The blonde sat up and stared at the figure in the doorway. A dark red 
tank top clung to Rei&#39;s figure, soaked through the sweat that rolled 
down her chest, arms and forehead. Her breathing was harsh and uneven as 
she leaned against the doorway tiredly.

&quot;Y-yeah,&quot; Serena whispered, surprised at how hoarse she sounded.

Rei frowned when she heard the blonde speak. Pushing herself away from 
the door, she walked over to the bed, arms crossed.

Unease and fear traveled through Serena. Was this Rei or Raven? Either 
way, Serena was captivated as she watched the other woman approach. 
Confident, proud and graceful, the assassin&#39;s movement alone embodied 
everything that was Rei Hino. Everything that amazed her.

Rei took off the fingerless glove on her left hand and placed it on 
Serena&#39;s forehead. After a second or two, she moved away.

&quot;Well, your fever&#39;s gone. But your temperature&#39;s still a bit high.&quot;

Serena nodded quietly.

&quot;I&#39;ll order something for you to eat; I doubt you want to taste my 
cooking. I&#39;d never force anyone to do that, especially when they&#39;re 
sick.

Serena giggled at the mischievous gleam in those gorgeous eyes. Rei 
smiled and grabbed the phone on the nightstand.

As the taller woman made the call, Serena watched her tired face 
intently. It must not have been an easy night for her.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower,&quot; Rei said once she was done. &quot;I&#39;ll be out 
before they get here.&quot;

A nod was her only response. The assassin turned and disappeared out the 
door.

Serena looked up once she heard Rei&#39;s footsteps. Sure enough, she 
entered, carrying a large tray. The delicious aroma filled her senses as 
she resisted the urge to drool.

The assassin rolled her eyes, but couldn&#39;t keep the smile off her face. 
She set the tray down on the nightstand.

The sick girl licked her lips, but wrinkled her nose when the smell of 
coffee hit her.

&quot;This is for me,&quot; Rei explained, reaching over and grabbing the cup as 
she took a seat on he bed.

To Serena&#39;s disgust, the other woman drank it black. She decided then 
that she&#39;d never going to get used to that.

&quot;Don&#39;t start on my coffee.&quot;

Hearing the protective tone in Rei&#39;s voice, the blonde rolled her eyes 
and giggled.

&quot;Just eat your food,&quot; the assassin mumbled.

Much to Serena&#39;s delight, the chicken noodle soup was delicious. It 
disappeared quickly, warming her. She then started on her fruit, looking 
up to find Rei was leaning on the footboard, her hair still wet from her 
shower and framing her face in a way that was beyond simply attractive. 
Violet eyes scanned the newspaper the assassin held, a mumble or a growl 
occasionally escaping from her lips.

Serena loved catching Rei during moments like this. The assassin seemed 
so peaceful... so adorable!

Sensing Serena&#39;s gaze, Rei looked up, a fine brow arching in question. 
The blonde blushed and quickly returned to her fruit.

&quot;Anything important in the news?&quot;

&quot;No, not really.&quot;

Rei put the paper down and crossed her arms again. She was much too lazy 
to change out of her bathrobe. Closing her eyes tiredly, her mind 
drifted.

Last night was certainly exhausting, and even after staying up with 
Serena for most of the night, sleep eluded her. The guilt of losing her 
temper at Serena forced her to drag her weary body away from the 
blonde&#39;s bedside and into the gym. It was now three in the afternoon, 
six hours since she first began her workout.

&quot;How much sleep did you get?&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rei said casually while sipping her coffee. &quot;A few hours.&quot;

&quot;Where&#39;d you sleep? I&#39;m in your bed.&quot;

&quot;The couch.&quot;

Silence.

&quot;Why am I in your room?&quot;

&quot;My room&#39;s closest to the bathroom.&quot;

&quot;What does that have to do with anything?&quot;

A dark blush appeared on Rei&#39;s cheeks, though it disappeared quickly.

&quot;I gave you a bath and washed your hair once you were properly warmed 
up.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Silence settled between the two. Serena was playing with the blanket. 
Rei had seen her...

A furious blush appeared on the blonde&#39;s cheeks. Only Minako has ever 
seen her naked, and that&#39;s because she&#39;s her cousin. She and Mamoru had 
never gone... well, that far. And here Rei had... she wasn&#39;t a stranger 
exactly, but still.

Despite herself, Serena imagined the other woman&#39;s strong hands running 
through her hair, the way they did when she dried and brushed her hair. 
Those same hands on her skin, bathing her gently.

&#39;Whoa, wait one minute! Stop right there! Bad thoughts! Bad!&#39;

While the blonde was having her internal battle, Rei got off the bed and 
walked over to her vanity table. Taking the brush, she began untangling 
her dark locks.

Blue eyes took in the image before her. The assassin sat in front of the 
mirror, her expression far away as she brushed her long, raven locks. 
She seemed completely at peace and relaxed.

Suddenly, Serena stood and made her way over to Rei. Without a word, she 
placed her hand on the hand holding the brush.

Lavender eyes met blue through the mirror in adorable confusion. The 
older woman simply smiled.

&quot;Let me.&quot;

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t be out of bed yet.&quot;

&quot;So?&quot;

To Serena&#39;s surprise, Rei didn&#39;t protest. Taking the brush, she began 
brushing the long, wet hair.

The assassin&#39;s hair was smooth and soft, just how Serena thought it 
would be. Rei&#39;s eyes slowly closed, her lips parted slightly as her 
chest rose and fell evenly. She was completely relaxed.

&quot;How&#39;s your hand?&quot;

Rei tensed as she opened her eyes. The blonde sighed softly in response. 
So much for the peaceful and relaxed Rei Hino. Sure, it was stupid to 
ask, but she was worried. There was a lot of blood last night.

&quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t look fine last night.&quot;

Rei tensed even further. She wasn&#39;t used to anyone except Makoto, Haruka 
and Michiru drilling her about how an injury was.

&quot;It&#39;s not as bad as it looked.&quot;

&quot;But you were working out, I&#39;m sure it must&#39;ve gotten a bit worse.&quot;

Rei was touched by Serena&#39;s concern, but she was starting to get a 
little annoyed.

&quot;I should clean the dishes.&quot;

Serena stepped back, startled as Rei suddenly stood. The raven-haired 
woman grabbed the tray and worked out.

With a frustrated sigh, Serena collapsed on the bed. How stupid was she? 
It had been the perfect moment. Never had she seen Rei so comfortable 
around her. And then she had to go and press her. At least Rei didn&#39;t 
lose her temper again.

Rei and Raven, two different personalities but the same person. Serena 
couldn&#39;t deny she found Raven captivating. Not only that, but beautiful 
as well. The flame in those lavender depths, burning brightly. Yet while 
the emotions raged on inside, her expression was calm and collected. Her 
movements were much more precise and deadly, like a dance. Every move 
counted.

The sound of the dishwasher being turned on snapped the blonde from her 
thoughts. But over that she could hear Rei speaking, though she couldn&#39;t 
make out what she was saying.

A few minutes later, Rei came back in. The dark-haired woman sat down on 
the bed and began reading her paper again.

&quot;Is there anything in particular you want to eat today?&quot;

Serena blinked as she turned her eyes to the other woman.

&quot;No, why?&quot;

&quot;I thought of going out for dinner so you can get some fresh air, but 
you&#39;re not well enough for that yet.&quot;

Serena nodded before turning around. She now sat in front of the vanity 
table, brushing her own long hair.

&quot;You didn&#39;t place the order already, did you? I didn&#39;t think a 
restaurant took orders this early for dinner.&quot;

&quot;No, I was ordering groceries.&quot;

Serena focused on Rei through the mirror. Her companion was leaning 
against the headboard, reading the newspaper still.

&quot;You&#39;re cooking?&quot;

Rei looked up, rolling her eyes.

&quot;Don&#39;t sound so excited.&quot;

Serena blushed slightly.

&quot;Sorry, but I thought you wouldn&#39;t force anyone to eat your cooking.&quot;

&quot;Yes, I did say that.&quot;

&quot;So, you want me to starve?&quot;

The blonde&#39;s teasing was rewarded by an annoyed glare.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then what am I going to eat?&quot;

&quot;What I cook.&quot;

&quot;Argh! You&#39;re so frustrating!&quot;

Violet eyes twinkled as Serena turned to glare at her. With a small 
smile, she went back to her reading.

&quot;I can cook some things. I&#39;ve been living on my own for six years. I 
have to be able to cook a little.&quot;

&quot;So, why didn&#39;t you make the soup?&quot;

Rei sighed and rubbed her temples.

&quot;I don&#39;t do soup. I usually get it out of the can or Makoto brings it 
over.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So, that means dinner will be edible?&quot;

Serena caught the pillow before it hit her. She stuck her tongue out at 
the assassin.

&quot;Oh, real mature.&quot;

The blonde glared at the other woman. She stood, stuck her nose up in 
the air, and marched into the bathroom. The door slammed behind her.

Rei smiled and shook her head. Now, back to that sentence she&#39;s been 
reading for the past half hour.
Serena held her stomach as she fell to the floor.

&quot;Oh... oh... my god! You&#39;re kidding!&quot;

Rei&#39;s smile was as wide as Serena had ever seen it. The woman reached 
out and grabbed another grape.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not! And then Michiru marched up to the stage, grabbed Haruka&#39;s 
beer, pulled on the waistband of her jeans... and poured it down her 
pants!&quot;

The older girl couldn&#39;t breathe anymore as she rolled on the floor. Her 
cheeks and sides hurt from laughing so much.

While Serena took a nice, long bath, Rei had made dinner. By the time 
the blonde was done, everything was ready. They sat on the floor in 
front of the couch, the food spread out on the coffee table. Rei&#39;s 
delicious meal turned out to be chicken and rice, with a fruit salad and 
biscuits.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, Rei began telling Serena 
about Haruka and Michiru&#39;s first date. Which led to the present, half an 
hour later.

Serena was sprawled out on the floor, breathing heavily with the 
occasionally fit of giggles. Her companion was leaning against the 
couch, a smile permanently engraved on her face.

&quot;That must&#39;ve been the first date from Hell!&quot;

Rei&#39;s smile widened. &quot;I don&#39;t know who to pity more, Michiru who had to 
put up with Haruka for the whole night or Haruka standing in the middle 
of a popular, black market bar with beer poured down her pants.&quot;

The blonde was seized by giggles again. She hasn&#39;t laughed so much 
since... well, before she was kidnapped.

Sorrow and homesickness seized her. The ever-present smile disappeared. 
Her family must be worried sick about her. Well, maybe not her Dad. He&#39;d 
be more than pleased about all the publicity. He probably thinks his 
daughter did something right, for once.

A warm hand touched hers. Blue met lavender as Serena looked up.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

It was surprising how many shades of purple a person&#39;s eyes could turn. 
Currently, it was a dark shade of violet, bordering on black. But 
definitely not the cold black they were when Raven took over. No, right 
now it was a caring, concerned and warm shade of violet.

&quot;I... I&#39;m fine.&quot;

Rei nodded. The light mood of the dinner was clearly gone. And to be 
truthful, she had been enjoying it. Just talking to Serena casually like 
that. It also felt good to hear her laugh. She knew she was the one to 
rob the blonde of that.

Rei stood, grabbed the dishes and started cleaning up. Serena blinked a 
few times and jumped to her feet.

&quot;Let me help you.&quot;

&quot;No, you&#39;re sick. Turn on the TV and relax.&quot;

Serena nodded and sat back down. She turned on the TV and flipped 
through the channels, looking for something to hold her attention.

Rei sighed and leaned against the sink. What was it about that girl? 
Such innocence, such carefree displays of emotion. To be honest, Serena 
scared Rei. Why? Because they were opposites in every way. Because the 
blonde was everything she&#39;d been taught never to be.

The burning water on her hand shook the assassin from her thoughts. 
Ignoring the pain, she finished washing the dishes. Great, now she has 
to change the bandages.

The lights suddenly went off. A scream sounded from the living room. She 
bolted out of the kitchen, grabbing a gun from behind a painting.

&quot;Serena?&quot;

&#145;Please answer.&#39;

&quot;Rei! It&#39;s dark!&quot;

Rei looked out the windows. Good, most of the city was dark. Just a 
power outage, that&#39;s all.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s the power&#39;s out on the block.&quot;

A whimper came from the direction of the couch. Rei tried to figure out 
what to do.

&quot;Serena, sit tight. I&#39;m going to get some candles.&quot;

The dark was practically her home. Lavender eyes adjusted to the lack of 
light quickly as Rei made her way to her bathroom.

A short while later, she returned to the living room. She noticed the 
shivering blonde on the couch. Despite the darkness, Serena&#39;s hair shone 
like gold. Ignoring her thoughts, she quickly walked over.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m right here,&quot; the assassin whispered, touching Serena&#39;s arm before 
setting up all the candles on the coffee table. Fishing into her pocket, 
she pulled out a lighter and lit the nearest candle.

That&#39;s when she saw Serena properly. She was huddled on the couch, 
shivering with her arms around her legs, which she had pulled to her 
chest. Blue eyes sought her lavender ones almost immediately.

Rei gave her a small, and what she hoped to be reassuring, smile before 
lighting a few more candles.

&quot;Better?&quot;

Serena nodded as she relaxed slightly.

&quot;I&#39;m going to look for some more candles.&quot;

After looking in every room and drawer, Rei came back with a few more. 
She hoped they would last them through the night and sat down on the 
couch.

&quot;Rei? How long is the power going to be out?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, not for long, I don&#39;t think.&quot;

It was obvious the blonde was scared. The taller woman ran a hand 
through her hair, smiling when she had an idea.

&quot;How about I bring out a few pillows and blankets? We&#39;ll sleep here if 
you&#39;d like.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

Rei laughed at the obvious relief in her voice. The dark-haired woman 
stood and went to get the blankets and pillows.

Serena stared at the flames dancing on top of the candles. Oh, how she 
hated the dark. But at least Rei was with her. She didn&#39;t think the 
woman was scared of anything. Most likely not.

The woman in question walked in, arms full. She dropped the load on the 
couch.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back in a minute.&quot;

As Rei turned, Serena noticed her bandaged hand. Where the woman was 
going suddenly clicked.

&quot;You should bring it over here where there&#39;s light.&quot;

&quot;Bring what?&quot;

&quot;The bandages. You are going to redress your hand, right? It&#39;s probably 
soaked from doing the dishes.&quot;

Rei sighed. Okay, so the girl noticed. She sat down on the couch and 
looked over at the blonde, who was leaning on a pillow, a blanket draped 
over her form.

The assassin moved closer to the candles and pulled out the stuff in her 
pocket. She unwrapped her hand, throwing them into the trash. She 
inspected the busted knuckles and cuts. Despite looking pretty nasty, it 
was far from the worse injuries she&#39;s suffered.

&quot;What happened?&quot; Serena asked as she reached over and touched the 
injured hand.

&quot;Oh, nothing really.&quot;

The blonde squeezed some of the cream Rei brought onto the taller 
woman&#39;s hand. She remembered Ami saying once that this type worked 
really well on cuts. Slowly, she spread the cream on the back of her 
companion&#39;s hand and fingers.

Lavender eyes watched her as she worked. Serena&#39;s touch was tender and 
warm, like everything else about her. Until she met her, the assassin 
had never felt such a gentle touch. Sex was certainly never gentle.

Rei&#39;s hand was extremely soft and her skin incredible smooth. How could 
an assassin have such nice skin?

&quot;So, how did you get this?&quot;

Rei hesitated. Serena&#39;s voice was soft, but firm. Might as well fess up.

&quot;I punched a window.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

There was silence as Serena gently wrapped Rei&#39;s hand. She stood and 
walked into the kitchen to wash her hands. The raven-haired beauty 
cleaned up.

By the time the blonde was back in the living room, the assassin was 
opening the blinds. Serena&#39;s eyes widened. All the lights in the city 
were off, except for a few government buildings. The stars were 
twinkling brightly in the sky, and there wasn&#39;t a cloud in sight.

&quot;It&#39;s beautiful tonight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Rei whispered, staring out the glass wall.

There was a knock on the door and the assassin moved toward the door, 
her hand slipping under her shirt to grasp the handle of the gun tucked 
in her waistband.

&quot;Who is it?&quot;

&quot;Miss Hino, it&#39;s Aki the security guard.&quot;

Rei opened the door. Only when she saw the familiar face of the young 
brunette did she release the hold on her gun. The teen gave her a smile 
and offered her a duffle.

&quot;The complex keeps one for each apartment for things like this. There 
are a flashlight, candles and some other stuff in there.&quot;

&quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;

Aki blushed when Rei flashed him a charming smile. He waved before going 
to the next door. The assassin locked the door securely before walking 
back to Serena. She pulled out a few more candles and the flashlight.

&quot;That&#39;s so much brighter,&quot; Serena said with a smile.

Rei nodded as she curled up on one end of the couch, watching Serena do 
the same on the other end. She felt the tension and hesitation coming 
from the blonde, but said nothing.

&quot;Rei, tell me about yourself?&quot;

The woman in question froze, lavender eyes staring at her companion in 
muted shock.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

The blonde shrugged nervously, waving her hands a little.

&quot;Like... your past or something.&quot;


I know. It&#39;s been a while since I last updated. I&#39;ve just been lazy, and 
busy with senior year. But it&#39;s spring break now and the college letters 
are rolling in, so I have all the time to spare. I hope to finish this 
before I head off to college, wherever that may be. So, look for more 
updates, and soon.

It&#39;s an awkward place to cut off, but I couldn&#39;t figure out where would 
be the best place, and to me this seemed to be it. You&#39;ll understand why 
in the next chapter.

Hope you enjoyed it.
