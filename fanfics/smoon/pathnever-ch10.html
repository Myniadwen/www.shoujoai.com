<p><u><strong>Author’s Note:</strong></u>Okay, so to answer a few questions. I’ve had a few reviews  about Kaiya using Saturn’s powers- She really isn’t. What she  really is saying is the password; think of it as a lock and key  method. Anyone could unlock a lock if they have the right key. It  does imply that in the chapter.</p>
<p><u><br />
The  Death Busters lab</u></p>
<p>A white figure stood at the lab  table, his face partially disguised by the shadows. For the most part  his attention was directed at the beaker in his hand, but he found  some to spare to an unfortunate subordinate.</p>
<p>“Kaolinite,  these failures are most displeasing.”</p>
<p>The long, red-haired  woman being addressed bowed her head slightly, unable to meet the  doctor’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Those pesky sailor senshi  seem have proven to be quite formidable, always at the scene of a  job…Our routine, change it, do something different. This is your <em>last</em> chance, do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>“Yes doctor.”<br />
  <em><br />
  </em>“Good. Now go and do not fail me.”</p>
<p>She  bowed obediently and then disappeared into the shadows.</p>
<p>When the woman was  sure to be gone the white figure raised his head and laughed, his  glasses reflecting what little light the room had to offer  menacingly. “Sailor senshi, I wonder how you will deal this time.”</p>
<p><u><br />
  Haruka’s POV,  her apartment</u></p>
<p>I couldn’t do anything…The fear of  seeing that impenetrable barricade… Was I afraid? Nothing I tried  worked, everything I did failed! Over and over, I summoned the ‘world  shaking’ but it… The world shaking… I choked back an oncoming  sob, only to find myself caught between laughing and crying.  Unconsciously my arms tightened their hold around the pillow I clung  onto, deforming the cushion as it pressed against my chest. Useless…I  hate it…I hate it! I wanted to yell, to thrash out. Anything to  silence these cursed thoughts. Just go away, I don’t want to  remember my own helplessness. It couldn’t be true, it didn’t <em>really</em> happen right?</p>
<p>My side throbbed suddenly,  forcing a sharp intake of air. “Ah!” One of my hands shot to the  source instantly. “Hah…hah…” Pain and a sea of  water…</p>
<p><strong>Click…click, click…</strong></p>
<p>Momentarily  distracted, I caught the window blinds clicking together from the  corner of my eye, welcoming an uninvited presence. The wind, which  was my only company this isolated moment in time. Only… I didn’t  wish for the guest now.</p>
<p>“You let me down…” I whispered  angrily. Rebelliously my eyes stared up at the ceiling with an  unwavering stubbornness.</p>
<p>I longed for the rain,  heaven’s tears. To have someone cry for me when I could not myself.  When <em>was</em> the last time I cried? My eyebrows furrowed  simultaneous as some strands of blonde fell into my eyes and obscured  my vision. With a deep sigh I blew up a breath of air that  immediately cleared the irritation. If only all my problems were so  simple. Soon my thoughts wandered back into previous territory. The  answer was,</p>
<p>I don’t remember…</p>
<p>“Heh…” I  admit, there were many times I had been close to losing it, however…  I’d always choke it back at the last minute, despite the comfort it  promised. …I know crying doesn’t change anything but it does make  a person feel better.</p>
<p>But, maybe I stopped because someone  heard me.</p>
<p><em>‘Why are you crying?’<br />
  </em><br />
  ‘<em>What?’</em></p>
<p>Michi…</p>
<p>Didn’t those two make a ‘perfect team’  together, taking that youma down in one go? Miss cool shades with her  ‘I’m better than you’ attitude. She didn’t have to come, we  were doing just fine; I could’ve gotten the crystal without any  help. With that thought, the image of the watery spears impaling my  side flashed before my mind’s eye.</p>
<p>Before  I knew it, both of my palms had clenched into tight fists. I-I  couldn’t believe it! It wasn’t enough to have my powers but that  person could use Neptune’s as well. What the hell is she? Human,  demon perhaps? I’d like to say the later but they haven’t made  any move to put us jeopardy…yet that was.</p>
<p>Bringing up a  hand to my face, I watched it open slowly curve open from a closed  fist into an open palm. I still could feel it, the blood draining  from my side, its warm liquid of life ebb away painfully slow leaving  me cold and weak. I was shaking as well, the feeling of my own  fingers trembling still lingered; even now they were still numb. If  she hadn’t shown up we’d have been…Breaking that thought I  violently shook my head. Damn it! Why her? Why not me…? I was the  one who promised to protect Michiru! Why did I have to be the one who  was weak and helpless? Weak and helpless…I was the one who was  saved.</p>
<p>“Argh!” In a  flash I had sat up and chucked the pillow across the room into the  dresser, knocking a few unstable objects to the floor. “!”</p>
<p>Then as quickly as I shot up I fell, landing my uninjured  side. “Geh…!” Everything swam before my eyes; the bleary images  would swirl and spark up every few seconds in color. However, the  sight was starting to make me feel queasy. I tried to get up again  only to find myself wondering which was up and where was my down.  Slow down, calm down, get a freaking grip on yourself! Just take deep  breaths, it’ll go away like always.</p>
<p>I had almost forgotten  that little detail.</p>
<p>“Hah…” A few tearful blinks ensued  until finally, my vision cleared. The first image that came into  focus was that irritating clock. 10:00am. Its red digital numbers  stared back, constantly nagging. For the circumstance, the thought  had completely slipped my mind. Oops, guess I’ll be missing school  today. No big deal I assured myself, I’ll make up for it later; I  wasn’t going to be there today anyway.</p>
<p>Again silence  infiltrated the apartment room.</p>
<p><em>‘Deep…SUBMERGE!’</em></p>
<p>“I  need to get out of here, just somewhere.” Or I’m going to go  crazy.</p>
<p>Carefully I threw my aching legs over the bed’s  edge; their muscles would twitch every so often, making me wish I had  stretched this morning. However that was now out of the question. If  I even tried I’d hurt myself again, and that was something I  definitely wanted to avoid. Sol ignoring the sharp jabs I managed to  propel myself onto the stiff limbs, but winced at the sudden shift of  weight. It’s just temporary, I told myself, after another transf-  The half-finished word hung in mental space, waiting to be finished  but was dropped like a dead weight. I felt myself inhale slowly,  taking in another deep breath before I sped walked towards the  dresser and kicked the pillow I had thrown shortly before to the  side.</p>
<p>In a few short moments I had picked out the desired  dress wear and allowed myself to fall back into my usual routine from  there on, which directed me to the bathroom next.</p>
<p>Fifteen  minutes and a warm shower later, I had somehow managed to dress  myself. The shower really helped but I really ought to be going  now…Trudging over to my bedside I swept up a small, packed duffel  bag in one smooth motion and then proceeded out the door. The ground  groaned underneath my burdened footsteps until a consecutive creak  and click drowned it out.</p>
<p>“I’ll going now.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV, future</u></p>
<p><em>It had been another quiet day, leaving me  with nothing to do really. The maids were briskly working to tidy up  the place and our guards were outside patrolling the palace borders  as usual.</em></p>
<p><em>I stopped walking for a moment to lean onto the  balcony edge, consciously careful not to wrinkle my favorite aqua  gown as I stared out into the beautiful garden. My eyes were  instantly met with groves of lush, colorful flowers. I loved their  variety, how each shone in their own unique way. Many times I would  go down there and spend hours painting. Not regular painting but one  with a passion! I could never resist marveling those soft petals,  their intricate designs and sweet scents… And the best part was  that there were so many! So many, that it was very difficult to  become bored with the task. Perhaps one day I shall record each  species into a book, one flower a day. Wouldn’t that be something?  I wonder how Ruka would react? She’d probably say, ‘you want to  become a writer?’ with that cute pout of hers. Then she’d chuckle  and tease me continuing on with ‘along with the other mountain full  of talents you already possess? If you don’t slow down, you’ll  run out of things to master.’</em></p>
<p><em>Ruka…I wonder when she’ll  be back? It had been almost a week now since she left for Crystal  Tokyo. I do hope there aren’t any problems with the Queen’s  delivery, she’s been waiting centuries for this. Besides, I doubt  Mamoru could handle any complications as well, he’d faint or have a  heart attack knowing him. Oh dear… A thought struck me. Wouldn’t  it be something if he really did faint and Ruka had to stay with him?  Hmm…It wasn’t impossible.</em></p>
<p><em>“Michiru mama!” I turned  expectantly towards the voice.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hotaru.” I greeted  cheerfully. “How are you feeling today?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Fine, thank  you.” She smiled back.</em></p>
<p><em>I eyed the young adult standing  before me. She’s really changed…Her eyes always seem to shine  brightly now despite their dark color, a wonderful change from her  previous self. Well, grown up is more like it I suppose; she’s no  longer the little baby we all knew. A young adult, physically  stronger and healthy…intelligent, kind, thoughtful, everything a  parent could ask for. Still, she prefers to keep her hair in that  cute hairstyle of hers and persists to wear those dark clothes as  always. Some things never change. However, someday I’m going to  paint her picture in a bright colored dress. I giggled inwardly at  that last thought, thinking of the inevitable shocked look that would  surely follow.</em></p>
<p><em>Hotaru narrowed her eyes suspiciously, “What  are you laughing about? It’s about me isn’t it?” Ah…She’s  onto me. She’s getting quite good at this.</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t know  what you’re talking about.” I calmly replied, giving her that  same smile as I brushed past her. “I’m going down to the garden.  Would you care join me?”</em></p>
<p><em>The woman seemed to think about it  for a short split second before calling out, “Hey, wait up,” and  jogged to my side as we both made our way down the blue and gold  corridor.</em></p>
<p><em><u>In the garden</u></em></p>
<p><em>“You really like  this place, don’t you Michiru mama?” Hotaru casually remarked as  she bent down to observe a violet flower.</em></p>
<p><em>“How did you  know?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Just a guess…” She muttered.</em></p>
<p><em>“Really…”  I sighed, taking the opportunity to sit myself down on the neatly  trimmed grass. My legs had become slightly stiff from wandering  around the palace all day. It really is a big place I must admit;  until this morning I’ve never quite realized how much.</em></p>
<p><em>Hotaru  turned around and walked over to take a seat beside me. “When will  Haruka papa come home?”</em></p>
<p><em>“I’m not sure sweet pea. Any day  now I think.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Well, I hope it’s soon.” She fell back  onto the grass. Without taking her eyes off the blue sky above us she  quickly added, “I miss making fun of Haruka papa’s bad  jokes.”</em></p>
<p><em>I also grinned. “You really shouldn’t say such  things.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But you’re laughing too!”</em></p>
<p><em>“…”  I playfully slapped her arm and in turn Hotaru started laughing, loud  enough for all the gardeners in the surrounding area to hear.  Meanwhile, I was struggling to keep my own blush under control. “Do  you know what I miss?” Hotaru shook her head. “I miss dancing  with Haruka. The way we’d spend hours moving to slow music and how  we somehow always end up in the balcony and staring up at the  stars…”</em></p>
<p><em>“…There’s something else?” The girl gave a  thoughtful look. “ I see…” Hotaru softly whispered, finally  understanding my silence. “But the process went well right? It  shouldn’t be too long to wait now.”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s right.”  It did go well. “I was very nervous but now, I’m not exactly sure  what to think.”</em></p>
<p><em>“You’re happy. It’s so obvious.” she  smiled. “I can tell.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Tell what?”</em></p>
<p><em>The  familiar voice made my heart skip a beat.</em></p>
<p><em>“Haruka!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Haruka  papa.”</em></p>
<p><em>Before I knew it I was running into the blonde’s  strong, open arms. The embrace was real, she was really here.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hey  there.” Ruka leaned down and gave me a peck on the cheek. “Miss  me much?”<br />
</em></p>
<p><em>I returned the peck  with a passionate kiss on her lips. “What do you think?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hmm…I’ll  take that as a ‘yes’.” She grinned and then turned her  attention to Hotaru next. “Hey kid, long time no see.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Is  that supposed to be a joke?” Hotaru sarcastically inquired,  crossing her arms stubbornly. Haruka’s eyes widened at the  gesture.</em></p>
<p><em>“Woah! You’ve been practicing haven’t  you?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Actually she has.” I finally spoke  up.</em></p>
<p><em>“For…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“That’s right Haruka papa, you  guessed it.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Hmm…” Haruka thoughtfully mused. “Then  that means?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yes. Haruka, I’m pregnant!”</em></p>
<p><u>Present  time, Mugen Gakuen</u></p>
<p>“Kaioh san, will you please answer  the question?”</p>
<p>Huh? “ X is equal to 13.”</p>
<p>“Humph,  very good. Try to keep from daydreaming Kaioh san.”</p>
<p>“Hai  sensei.”</p>
<p>I didn’t realize…I must have zoned out.  Looking around the classroom, I could see the other students  dutifully working at the assigned worksheets and then I glanced back  at my own completed ones. One thing less to worry about... What was I  thinking about exactly again? When I try to remember, it feels so  hazy…As though awakening from a dream, only to remember bits and  pieces of it.</p>
<p>Flowers… of different colors, a  young girl with dark hair and… someone else. I was there, waiting  for someone to come home. But who? And where was home? It didn’t  look like Tokyo. Could it be a memory of the past? Hmm…No, that’s  impossible. Haruka and I have already regained all of our past sailor  senshi memories. So…then what could it be?</p>
<p>My  gaze soon wandered again, beckoning me to look out the window and  admire the beautiful day once more. I’ve really been out of it  since yesterday; I hope Haruka is all right. That blow she took  really scared me; there was a lot of blood. When she blacked out in  the end, I almost panicked.</p>
<p><em>“Uranus! Uranus, wake  up!”</em></p>
<p>…It was a good thing that I got her back to her  apartment quickly. There was no telling how badly infected it  could’ve gotten if we left it be. I sighed. Sometimes… it seems  like things just keep getting complicated, don’t they? A hospital  might have drawn unwanted attention, something we couldn’t risk.  And then I couldn’t let our ally help me drop Haruka off without  risking our civilian identities. So I ended up dragging Ruka home,  almost literally.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it appears that Ruka  hasn’t come to school today. Good, it would do her well to stay  home and rest. There’s no way she can expect to race in tomorrow’s  competition if her body isn’t in any condition to. Besides, there’s  only so much our senshi healing powers can do…</p>
<p>Wait a  minute…Speaking of conditioning, isn’t her clocking test today?  Oh no…</p>
<p>“Sensei, I need to go now.”</p>
<p>“W-What?”</p>
<p>“It’s  important.” I persisted.</p>
<p>“…Oh, one of those violin  rehearsals is it?”</p>
<p>“Very well. Be sure  to catch up what you miss.”</p>
<p>“Hai. Arigato.”</p>
<p>I’ll  check her apartment first…And if she’s not there, then the  racetrack!</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s Pov, at the racetrack</u></p>
<p>I  walked slowly, gripping the rail as I attempted to go down the stairs  into the stadium entrance. Wow, that took a lot more energy than I  thought it would, I’m actually a bit breathless.</p>
<p>‘Whew…”  Finally making it into the place I stopped to look at the familiar  surroundings. I can actually think here, almost nothing can touch me.  A strong wind blew up, sending the sides of my unzipped jacket  sprawling forward with only my back holding it in place. Agree with  me huh? I can… almost hear the crowds. Crazy, isn’t it? I closed  my eyes, allowing past sensations to flood into me. This place filled  with their loud cheers and the sheer size of the masses! I could  imagine it now. It didn’t have to be my name they were screaming,  that didn’t matter. It was…racing itself. The entire experience  made it special! However, if four certain people would cheer me on,  it’d mean the world to me.</p>
<p>“Haruka! You’re  early!”</p>
<p>“Kameda!” I opened my eyes to see the mechanic  rush over. “I know, I hope it isn’t a problem. There were some  things on my mind and I just…well needed to come here.”</p>
<p>“That  so? Hmm…” He gave a sympathetic look. “Listen, it’s no  trouble at all! In fact, maybe it was fate; your baby is all tuned up  and she’s ready to go at any time.”</p>
<p>“Really? Wow, that  was fast! How long did you spend on it exactly?” Last time I saw my  bike, it needed some <em>serious</em> tuning. Kameda must’ve spent  all night working on it!</p>
<p>“Eh, you know, a little here and  there.” He waved off the praise. “But never mind that! Want to go  for a test drive?”</p>
<p>“Right now, seriously? That’d be  great!”</p>
<p>“Awesome, I’ll even clock you. We can get it  done now.”</p>
<p>I tried walking forward, only to almost trip  over myself. “!”</p>
<p>Kameda lunged forward but  fortunately I caught my balance in the nick of time. Before he could  ask ‘ are you all right’ I quickly assured him,</p>
<p>“Just a  bit sore, working out you know.”</p>
<p>“…All right, but try  not to overdo it okay?”</p>
<p>I nodded. I’ve really  got to be more careful, next time I really could fall flat on my  face. HA, Kaiya would love to see that. I can see the little brat  laughing her guts out if she did… But I am getting better; I can  almost walk without any pain now.</p>
<p>“So let’s  go!”</p>
<p><u>Clocking</u></p>
<p>The world had become a  blur, everything flashed over the visor. A whirl of colors never  ceased to amaze me, I loved every bit of it. The wind, the speed, the  sheer power! This is my element, where I belong. It’s a place where  I can forget everything, the hardships of duty, the fate of the world  and especially, the anger of…failure. Some people call it running  away, but let them think what they want. What do they know? ‘You’re  just a stupid girl’, ‘Tenoh is an amazing person who will break  the record…’, ‘I know you must be sad about your father’s  death’…Damn those people, damn that magazine. They know nothing!  How can you judge me? How can you claim to know me so well when I  don’t even know myself? What do I want?</p>
<p>“Raaaaaaah!”  Faster, come on. I’ll show all of you!</p>
<p><em>‘What do <u>you</u> want Haruka?’</em></p>
<p>Obaa  chan…</p>
<p><strong>VvvrrrrrRroooooOOOOOOMMM!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>After  finishing the clocking test</u></p>
<p>“Haruka! Hey, Haruka! That  was amazing!” Kameda shouted enthusiastically as I dismounted my  bike. “You really were on fire today.”</p>
<p>“Think so?” I  wonder why. “That’s it for today then?” It was really weird…Why  did I think about <em>that</em> during the session?</p>
<p>“Yeah,  pretty much, for today’s training anyway. But it seems there’s a  call for you in the garage.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Don’t  ask me, I don’t know anything. You can get it right now, I’ll put  away your bike for you.”</p>
<p>“Thanks.”</p>
<p>A telephone  call for me? Who could it be? Kami, please don’t let it be Michiru!  If she knew I wasn’t resting up she’d…Maybe I should skip out  the back entrance right now.</p>
<p>But…what if it wasn’t?</p>
<p>I  had finally reached the garage office and quickly located the on hold  receiver. It was tempting to pick it up but for some reason, I just  got a real bad feeling from it.</p>
<p>“Hah…hah…” I found  myself sweating again, finding it difficult to breath. It wasn’t  Michiru. Something told me it was more. I gulped as my hand reached  out, daring to grip the receiver and bringing the cold plastic to my  ear. “Tenoh Haruka speaking…”</p>
<p>“Haruka? Is that really  you?”</p>
<p>Now I know why…</p>
<p>“Obaa…  chan…”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s Pov, racetrack</u></p>
<p>“What?”  Did I hear right?</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, that’s all I know.”  Kameda apologized. “Haruka rushed out saying she was going to catch  the first train out...Something about going home and not to worry,  whatever that means.”</p>
<p>A train…And going home? She couldn’t  be…But it’s the only logical answer! “Arigato.” I bowed,  readying myself to leave.</p>
<p>“You know I’m worried about  Haruka; I mean her driving today was dead on as usual, but there was  just…something different about her today.”</p>
<p>“Different…?”  I mouthed the word. Something didn’t feel right; why was she going  back, why now? Are you running away again?</p>
<p>“Anyway, if you  happen to talk to her, would you remind her that the race is  tomorrow? We’re all counting on her.”</p>
<p>“Sure…” I need  to find Kaiya!</p>
<p><u>On the bus</u></p>
<p>Well, I did find  her, half-asleep in class that was. Yet after hearing about Haruka’s  abrupt disappearance she woke up immediately and insisted on tagging  along. I was immensely relieved, not having to coax someone for a  change. I don’t know how I would’ve done it either…What would I  say? Haruka, who was injured during a youma battle ran off before her  big race and I didn’t want to leave you behind because you could be  in danger? Even if it was the truth…I shook my head. For a second  there, I almost wished Kaiya were a part of the sailor senshi; then  Ruka and I wouldn’t have to hide it all from her. We could protect  her properly, warn her that she was a potential target. But if that  were true, she would have to fight all of these burdening battles as  well. I don’t want that. It’s dangerous, you’re life could end  at any time…The weight of it all could suffocate anyone with a weak  spirit; even those with strong wills find it challenging as it is.</p>
<p>By habit I let out a long sigh, but managed to keep it  down and avoid waking the dozing blonde lying in the seat opposite to  me. I found myself staring, feeling strangely protective of the girl.  Couldn’t stay awake the poor thing… Without another thought I  took my own pillow and placed it carefully under her head.  There…Kaiya mumbled something incoherent and then rolled over,  continuing her deep slumber. I couldn’t understand the feeling  myself; we were in the same grade, around the same age but I felt  like I wanted to protect her from everything, the world itself. Not  the same way as with Haruka but very similar…</p>
<p>I  spent the next few minutes listening to the vehicle’s monotonous  rumbling. Unable to fall asleep myself my gaze moved out the window  and watched the scenery flash by, anything to get my mind off of it.  I…I can’t believe I’m going back. When <em>was</em> the last time  Ruka and I been there? A few years, three perhaps? Our birth place,  where we met and grew up… I’m grateful for it, however I do not  sorely miss the it, how could I? So many painful memories…It was  also the place where our worlds came crumbling down and we were  shoved into this spiral of violence called destiny.</p>
<p>Do you  remember Ruka? We left it all there, in that little world of ours. It  must have been extremely hard, especially for you.</p>
<p>I took out  and peered down at my communicator, which hasn’t sounded since  yesterday. I’ve been trying to contact my partner for the last  three hours but nothing. The connection must be broken I finally  concluded. However, why won’t it work now? My hands held the tiny  golden object loosely, debating whether to attempt it again. But what  if it wasn’t a regular glitch, what if Ruka did it herself? Did you  Ruka? Do you want to be left alone this badly? I don’t know what  I’ve done wrong, but please don’t push me away…</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  Pov, town entrance</u></p>
<p>I haven’t been here for so long! The  train blew its final warning and then started to chug away from the  raised platform, leaving me to my actions.</p>
<p>“Guess I better  get going.”</p>
<p>I swung my backpack over one shoulder and  started down the steps into a flat groove. If I remember correctly, I  only need to follow this dirt path; it should take me towards  town…</p>
<p><strong>Tup, tup, tup, tup…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Heh, ironic isn’t  it? The memory of our last departure vividly came flooding back. Only  another world ago the two of us walked along this very same path,  seeking our own.</p>
<p>A cool shadow fell over my form as I passed  into the forested area of the trail. Not much longer now, should be  beyond this bit… I wonder if the town has changed much since I last  saw it…I bet if Michi were here, she’d say this place hasn’t  changed at all; the flowers, the trees that tower over this road, and  the air are all the same. Still, this is only the outside border. No  telling how the inside has changed; who knows, perhaps its gotten  bigger…</p>
<p>“…Ah.’ I threw an arm up to cover my face from  the bright light. That’s the part I’ve always hated about this  trail, the way it frequently sends you in darkness before dragging  you into the bright light and nearly blinding you. Waiting for my  eyes to adjust, I peeked through the cracks between my fingers to see  the sight that I knew would await me. There, down the hill from where  I stood the town stared back bright as day. From here I could see the  few tall buildings of central towering over the smaller residential  areas that surrounded it. As always, you could tell where the city  center was. And if you looked beyond the industrial structures  altogether you could see the ocean. I narrowed my eyes, willing them  to bring the floating masses by the large swirl of blue into focus.  It appears the ports are still open, the fish market must really be  booming; there were so many ships!</p>
<p>“Heh.” It really was  here, not some crazy dream. “I’m back…”</p>
<p><u>Town  entrance</u></p>
<p>I had scrambled down the hill to the gateway,  almost tripping the entire way in excitement. Everything was left  back here, for all of our sakes. I thought I had forgotten  everything, told myself that it wasn’t important at all.  But…</p>
<p>“Woah…”</p>
<p>I walked purposefully inwards,  taking slow cautious steps into the nostalgic atmosphere. For a  moment I had to blink. I remember this side of town…Michiru used to  live around here. Not in either of the houses to my right or left, it  was further down… and around the corner I think. Well, any case it  was the people who were a bit more well off that stayed in these  houses. When I was little I’d always think about how silly these  people were, spending more than they needed. Thinking stuff such as  ‘why couldn’t they live like the rest of us?’ How incredibly  naïve I used to be. A child who easily gave away their trust,  only to have it fly back and bash them in the face. My hand  automatically came up to lightly touch a spot on my cheek. Those  bastards…</p>
<p>A cool breeze broke my concentration, bringing me  back from a place that I almost fell into. Never mind I’ve got to  get going.</p>
<p><u>City center</u></p>
<p>It was definitely  much more crowded here; there were actually some crowds and cars down  in this area. Not nearly as much as Tokyo, but enough to considered  inhabited.</p>
<p>“Come on light, change.” With my arms crossed  I stood at the intersection, tapping my foot impatiently. I was  almost there, so close. It won’t be much longer now. The beach was  only twenty minutes away.</p>
<p>“Tenoh, Tenoh Haruka, is that  you?”</p>
<p>I turned on the spot, my vision darted frantically  around the faces to pinpoint the source. That’s when it fell onto a  middle aged shopkeeper, who had stopped doing his daily  sweeping.</p>
<p>“Baluk san?”</p>
<p>“Then it really is you! I  haven’t seen you in years! Would you come inside?” The kind man  smiled.</p>
<p>“I don’t know, I was supposed to meet obaa  chan.”</p>
<p>“Even better.” He beamed. “I have an order for  her, you can deliver it when you go visit.”</p>
<p>If that’s the  case, what could it hurt? “Why not?”</p>
<p>I sat  down at one of the wooden tables, listening to the chair groan under  my weight. Oh come on, I’m not really that heavy, I tried to argue  back mentally. Baluk san would surely be much more trying; the  shopkeeper wasn’t fat or skinny, but gaining on the chubby side you  could say. I suppose middle age can do that to you. I chuckled and  the man across from me raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>“Still think my  name is funny?” Baluk san was an immigrant from Ukraine who  originally was travelling around Japan to see the sights. He was a  regular anime otaku as well; you could see his bakery shelves filled  with plushies through the main window. That’s what attracted him to  visit here but what made him stay was the woman he fell in love with  and gave him the honor of being his wife.</p>
<p>“Hmm? No, not at  all! I was just thinking about that plushy obsession of yours; Michi  is a lot like that as well.” I looked over to the shelf behind the  cashier. “Looks like you’ve collected a ‘little’ more since  we last spoken.” Who was I kidding, there were so many that any of  them could fall off that tiny space at any moment.</p>
<p>“Uhh…Well  you know me Haruka.” Baluk san ruffled his brown hair with a free  hand in an embarrassed manner. “Tea?”</p>
<p>“Yes please.” He  tipped some hot liquid into a hand sized coffee mug. “Arigato.” I  picked up the gift and sipped it slowly, allowing the taste to  linger. The warmth convinced me entirely that I was here now. Or  maybe I wished I wasn’t for this particular moment.</p>
<p>“So  you’re still in contact with Kaioh Michiru? Must be pretty close if  you’re calling her ‘Michi’ eh?” He winked, making me spew my  tea.</p>
<p>“…I don’t know what you’re talking about.” I  tried to say with a straight face, only to fail horribly when I  coughed on some remaining tea.</p>
<p>“Sure, say whatever you  want.” He grinned. I hate that grin. “So anyway, what made you  come back? Was it to visit your obaa chan? And is Kaioh san around  too?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, pretty much to visit. We talked over the  phone a bit and I decided to drop by.”</p>
<p>“That’s great!  She talks about you a lot, you know. Always taking pride in watching  you race, doing the thing you love the most.”</p>
<p>Really? Well,  that was a surprise…</p>
<p>‘I watch too whenever I can, but I  really laughed my guts out when you almost fell on your face  accepting that last reward. You should’ve seen it!” Must resist  urge to kill.</p>
<p>“You know, you remind me of someone else I  know.”</p>
<p>“Really? Whom, if I may ask?”</p>
<p>“Well,  she’s a blonde like me, about my age. Very loud, irritating, a  constant thorn in the side and takes pleasure from it. Plus, she’s  a genius second to ‘Michiru’ which annoys me to no  end!”</p>
<p>“Competition?” Baluk san inquired, looking very  curious.</p>
<p>“NO WAY!”</p>
<p>“Woah, down girl, I was just  kidding.” He laughed, making feel like I’ve made a fool of myself  once more. Sure, Kaiya and Michiru are close, but not anything like  that!</p>
<p>“About that order…?” I muttered, trying hard to  keep eye contact.</p>
<p>“Right, right. I’ll go get it for you.”  He stood and walked into the back room, returning moments later with  a large box of freshly baked pastries. You could smell them through  the box, mouth-watering actually. He must’ve seen my expression  because he warned, “Now don’t try it, you know what your obaa  chan would say if she caught you.”</p>
<p>“I’ve grown up a bit,  give me some credit hey?”</p>
<p>“Well you have grown  taller…however you’re still the same Haruka but in  lov-“</p>
<p>“Don’t…say…it.” I glared menacingly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, come by again sometime and maybe we can have  lunch, perhaps chat like the old days.”</p>
<p>“Sounds good, I’ll  be seeing you then. Say hello to the miss for me.”</p>
<p>“You’ve  got it.”</p>
<p>I ran out of the store, leaving the loud bell  sound fading fast behind. It was nice to seeing Baluk san again; he  was one of the people I actually missed. The man was like a father to  me when I lived here. No… calling him my father would be an insult;  he was better than that bastard.</p>
<p><em>“I love you…”</em></p>
<p>A  woman screaming stops for the last time.</p>
<p><em>“Why are you  crying?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What? I don’t know what you’re talking  about.”</em></p>
<p><br />
  <u>Beach docks</u></p>
<p>“Less than a  quarter of the way to go.”</p>
<p>I could see her house from here  on the pier; it’s just a little ways down this strip of beach.  But…what a view. I raised my hand to shadow my eyes, allowing  myself to stare forward into the clear horizon. The beach by Michi’s  place is nothing compared to this! The air…I had almost forgotten  the air here, its salty scent, the wind’s purity and freedom  pulsing strongly in it as one with a pure heart. In Tokyo, I had  almost choked when I first arrived; the air was extremely violated,  marred by industry. And this place’s water…Almost took my breath  away. My reflection grinned back up at me as I thought this. It was  clean for the most part; I could see the shore bottom from the here.  Now I really wished I had brought Michiru, I know she’d loved it.  Well, this part anyway…</p>
<p>Why did I run off like that? I could  have phoned her to the very least. A sudden urge of throwing myself  off the pier and giving myself a well-deserved soak tackled me hard;  I bet she’s furious at me right now. But I still have to deliver  these pastries to obaa chan…I know what’ll I do. I’ll give  Michi a call when I get there…Its days like this that I wish I  didn’t leave my communicator at home. I was in a huge rush and  there’s no way a youma would show up here. I mean, what were the  chances? Zero?</p>
<p>Finally making it up the stretch of beach, I  reached my destination. It was a quaint house, standing by itself and  partially shielded from sight by a patch of deciduous trees. From  here you could see the rising smoke stack…That crazy old woman is  probably cooking something; its too warm for anyone to have the  heater on. Finishing that thought, I realized I had somehow made it  up the front stairs and was waiting at the door. Okay, I’m here.  ‘Well, no duh’ my mind retorted. Guess I should stop standing  around and knock. I hesitatingly lifted a free hand and lightly  rapped on the screen.</p>
<p>“Obaa chan? It’s Haruka.” I  knocked again. “Obaa chan? Are you ho- Ack!” Reacting on a sudden  instinct I leaped back, off the steps and onto soft sand.</p>
<p><strong>Thud!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Oh  no, don’t tell me…</p>
<p>“Nice dodge kid, seems like you’ve  improved.” She’s on the roof! “Would you mind tossing that  hammer back up here?” That crazy old kook, maybe this was why I  didn’t want Michi is come.</p>
<p>“What the hell do you think  you’re doing? Get down from there before you fall and break your  neck!”</p>
<p>“Fixing the shingles, some came loose in the last  rainstorm. But don’t worry, I’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“But you’re  old; you’re not as young as you used to be. Stop being so stubborn  and get back onto flat ground.”</p>
<p>“I’m only eighty-eight,  so chill.” Seeing that I wasn’t about to toss up the hammer she  had taken out a wrench and was about to attempt to drill a nail down  with it. Guess I’m going to have to pull out all the stops.</p>
<p>“Well  that’s too bad. You know I can’t let all this good stuff go to  waste. If you won’t help then…” I took out a pork bun and held  it up to my mouth for emphasis, watching the senior through one open  eye freeze.</p>
<p>“All right! I get it!”</p>
<p><u>Inside  the house, kitchen</u></p>
<p><u></u>Somehow I managed to get her inside  and seated without too much difficulty, but what a way to welcome  someone! I mean, who throws a hammer at a guest? Finding myself  staring at the exact person just had answered that question quite  bluntly. Good thing obaa chan’s weakness is food…I peered over at  the cardboard box to see half of the pork buns have already been  devoured, the old lady sure can eat a lot.</p>
<p>“You know, if  you eat so much you’ll gain weight.”</p>
<p>She stopped to look  up, “Really now? I didn’t know that.” Was that sarcasm? I felt  myself become slightly irritated by her behavior.</p>
<p>“Yeah,  really. And I thought you were sick, what’s with this fake illness  shit?”</p>
<p>“I was sick.” She grinned. “Had this terrible  cough. But it was gone since this morning, can you imagine  that?”</p>
<p>Yeah, actually I could.</p>
<p>“But you know I  have a huge race tomorrow!” This was stupid, I couldn’t believe I  fell for it.</p>
<p>To my surprise, obaa chan gave that mysterious  smile of hers. What was that for? Keeping eye contact she happily  said, “I know.”<br />
  I wasn’t so happy with that answer; there  was something else she wasn’t confessing. My eyebrows furrowed in  thought. It was clear that she was holding back, but what was it?  Times like this I wish I had Michiru’s sixth sense, and…huh? I  blinked; did she just look sad? Even if only for a split second, I  was sure of it!</p>
<p>“Why did you really… call me here?”</p>
<p><strong>Lub  dub… Lub dub… Lub dub. Lub dub.</strong></p>
<p>“Nothing really.”  I almost literally fell off my chair.</p>
<p>“What do you mean  ‘nothing really’!” Why is she acting as though nothing  happened?</p>
<p>In silence I watched the senior pick up her teacup  and move over to the sink to wash it. The sound of running water soon  filled the kitchen, drowning out the impatient tapping of my foot.  Did she really mean it? I waited, seeing if she would explain  herself, what she was thinking right now, but nothing. It irritated  me, she was always like this around me; she never says what’s on  her mind.</p>
<p>Not liked being ignored, I stood and walked out into  the living room to ponder over my own thoughts. Did she really call  me out here for nothing? No answer other than the ticking of the  grandfather clock replied. There really isn’t much to do around  here, do I just sit and wait for her to finish? My eyes jumped from  object to object in the small room. She still had the same old  coaches, the same small television by the main window…however she  did get a few new plants, I had noticed. That’s when I my gaze  finally stopped at the front door. Was she like this because of that?  Everything in the room darkened from my sight aside that single spot  in front of the screen. I never said ‘goodbye’ properly those  many years ago… A guilty lump started to form in my throat. It was  just some scribbling on a piece of paper, left on the kitchen table  for her to find the next morning. I remember how I stood in front of  that screen door for eternity length minutes, staring up at the  stairs and wondering how she would feel when she found out. Perhaps  she would celebrate for joy or that’s what I wanted to believe.  Then she wouldn’t have to take care of some brat she picked up off  the street. After I left and no search party had come looking, I  stopped looking back and started to walk forward on my own.</p>
<p>The  water in the kitchen suddenly stopped, bringing my attention to  reality.</p>
<p>As she began to speak my heart skipped a beat. What  if she was going to tell me what she thought when I left?. “Ruka,  would you be a help and pick up my prescription for  me?”</p>
<p>“Wha-“</p>
<p>“It’s on the coffee table in the  living room. And yes, you’ll have to go back to town. Be sure to be  back in three hours for supper.”</p>
<p>Without another word I  picked up the flimsy piece of paper and left, trying not to slam the  door behind me. Great, she did it again.</p>
<p>“Haruka…”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  Pov, city center</u></p>
<p>“So, this is it?” Kaiya yawned,  before stretching out her arms.</p>
<p>“That’s right.” I  watched the blonde’s eyes widen, analyzing our surroundings with a  critique eye. When she frowned I found myself asking, “What’s  wrong?”</p>
<p>“You weren’t kidding when you said it was small;  it must be ten times smaller than Tokyo!”</p>
<p>“True, but size  isn’t everything.” I gently reminded her.</p>
<p>“So, which  way do we go?”</p>
<p>“Well…I’m not exactly sure.”</p>
<p>“What?  Please tell me you’re joking.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “She  never told me where she was going; I only know that she’s in here  somewhere.”</p>
<p>“…Does she have any family? If she does,  maybe she’s staying over there.”</p>
<p>“That’s  possible…however I really have no idea where that would be either.  When we were younger, Ruka would always come over to my place to  visit, or we’d hang out in the park. For some reason we never  visited her place, not once.”</p>
<p>“It’s hopeless isn’t  it…?” Kaiya muttered.</p>
<p>“Not at all, it’ll just take  some time though. I suggest we check the most likely places Ruka  would be, such as any hotels or inns and go from there. Who knows,  maybe we’ll run into someone who’s seen her.”</p>
<p>“All  right, sounds good.”</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV, up a main  road</u></p>
<p>I couldn’t believe Michiru didn’t know where  Haruka was. Did that blonde idiot really rush off without saying  anything? It’s understandable that she didn’t call me, but  Michiru as well? Now that fishy, I wonder what’s up…</p>
<p>Hmm…Anyway,  this place doesn’t seem all that bad; it’s somewhat packed but  not extremely crowded. I’m not going to lie, being around a ton of  people makes me squirm. I never know what to say or who to look at.  And then there’s the part where you could possibly make a fool or  yourself and die from embarrassment. I remember the first day where I  had to introduce myself in front of the entire class, and all I’m  going to say about that is ‘never again’.</p>
<p>“Let’s check  here first.” Michiru suggested. I looked up to see a tall, white  building towering over us. It wasn’t a hotel, couldn’t be judging  by how close those windows and balconies were. An apartment most  likely.</p>
<p>“You really think she would be here? I thought we  were going to check something bigger…”</p>
<p>“Well, she really  isn’t into the huge and fancy places, not in this sort of  situation. Knowing her, she’d try to find an establishment that is  somewhat secluded and keep to herself.”</p>
<p>I nodded, accepting  the words for fact. It did sound like something Haruka would do. Even  back at ‘home’ she’d go off by herself every once in a  while…</p>
<p>I followed Michiru into the front foyer, making note  of how dreary the place was portraye. Everything was a shade of gray,  no bright color of any kind. Surely Haruka wouldn’t pay good money  to stay here, I know I wouldn’t.</p>
<p>“Do you have a guest  under the name of Tenoh staying here by any chance?” I heard  Michiru inquire the clerk.</p>
<p>“Tenoh? I don’t believe so…”  There were a couple of clicks as he searched for the information on  the computer. “No, I’m sorry. We don’t have anyone under that  name.”</p>
<p>“She’s a tall blonde, wouldn’t have checked in  before today.”</p>
<p>Again the clerk shook his head. “No one by  that description has come by.”</p>
<p>“I see…Thank you for your  time.”</p>
<p>I almost jumped for joy; Haruka wasn’t staying  there! Augh, but that means we have to look somewhere else now…Note  to self, beat some sense into that idiot after I find her.</p>
<p>“Hey  Michiru, before we get too wrapped up in this…”</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“Can  we eat first?” And as if on cue my stomach grumbled, chipping in  its two bits as well. I hadn’t eaten anything since lunch and that  was…four, five hours ago? I’m starving!</p>
<p>Michiru had a  good giggle at my expense. Still, that didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p>“We could go right now I suppose. I haven’t had a bite to  eat for awhile myself.” Really now? That’s great!</p>
<p>“You  should choose, I have no clue where anything is.” Hopefully  whatever she chooses will have good food. Officially my mind put the  search for our friend on hold.</p>
<p>“Hmm…Now that I think about  it, I have just the place.”</p>
<p>“Really? What’s it  like?”</p>
<p>“It’s a place where we might get information on  Haruka and a bite to eat all at once.”</p>
<p>…I wonder what she  meant by that.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV</u>, <u>Bakery</u></p>
<p>I  opened the door for the taller teen and watched her enter eagerly.  There was a small tingle sound from the bell atop the entranceway as  we entered, but it was easily overlooked for the aroma of baked  goods. Hmm…I looked around, where was the baker? I do hope Baluk  san still owned the establishment; any familiar face would help to  loosen the nervous knot in my stomach.</p>
<p>“Hey, anyone here?”  Kaiya tapped the tiny bell on the front counter impatiently. Perhaps  there was someone in the back room? Sure enough a voice almost  immediately responded,</p>
<p>“In a second…Haruk- Wait a minute,  you aren’t Haruka…” As the man approached and peered closely at  Kaiya I heard alarm bells sounding in my head; did he say Haruka?</p>
<p>“…  Did you just say Haruka?”</p>
<p>When our eyes met the bread maker  stumbled back for a moment, his mouth open but no words initially  came out.</p>
<p>“Michiru? Kaioh Michiru, it is you! And yes, I  did say Haruka; she passed by here earlier today. This has certainly  made my day, so many old friend’s dropping by for a visit.” He  beamed. “And perhaps a new one too. Who’s this?”</p>
<p>“This  is Kaiya, she transferred to our school recently.” I began the  introduction.</p>
<p>“Umm…nice to meet you.” The blonde gave a  slight bow.</p>
<p>“Interesting…” Baluk san muttered, whether  it was meant to himself or for all to hear I couldn’t be sure. “You  know, this kid resembles Haruka a great deal wouldn’t you say? I  almost had confused the two when I first saw her.”</p>
<p>Kaiya  resembling Haruka? I turned all my attention onto the girl. Perhaps a  bit… but then again, many blondes look alike. Their hair length,  eye color and height all varied slightly as well. However, I do  remember asking Ruka if they were related once, but the she brushed  it off with a negative and I accepted it; they’re very different  individuals.</p>
<p>“Uh… why is everyone staring at me?”  Kaiya shifted on the spot nervously. Oh, I was doing it again wasn’t  I?</p>
<p>“No reason.” I smiled. But onto more important matters…  “Baluk san, you said you’ve seen Haruka, do you know where she is  or where she’s gone? We’ve been looking for her all day.”</p>
<p>“Did  she ditch you or something? That crazy girl, I should’ve known!”  He laughed. “Or perhaps it was partially my fault; I asked her to  deliver some pastries to her obaa chan’s place. It’s this single  house out down on the beach stretch if you’re interested.”</p>
<p>“Did  you hear that?” Kaiya grinned.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.” It was  great news, the best I’ve heard all day. The feeling in my stomach  loosened immensely and I wasn’t feeling so exhausted anymore. In  fact, I could probably run the entire way to the beach right now if  it meant seeing Ruka again.</p>
<p>A sudden tugging on my  shirtsleeve drew my attention back, to the hand and then its owner.  Kaiya apparently knew what I was thinking; the look on her face said  it all. Ah…That’s right, I almost forgot in all this  excitement.</p>
<p>“It was nice to have spoken with you again, but  unfortunately we’re a bit short on time today. Would it be possible  to have something wrapped to go?”</p>
<p>“I hear ya, it’s no  problem at all.” The bread maker disappeared into the backroom once  more. While we waited, I could see my companion sigh a breath of  relief out of the corner of my eye. I smiled inwardly at the sight,  she was an interesting person I had to admit; that pleading face she  made earlier could rival Ruka’s!</p>
<p>“Here you go.” Baluk  san returned, handing the package to Kaiya. As I made to pull out  currency from my purse he added, “It’s on the  house.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“No sense in arguing, I won’t  accept it!” I could sense his stubbornness and there was no point  in debating over the issue as he stated. For one, I doubt I would  have the energy and secondly, finding a certain blonde took  precedence over the matter.</p>
<p>Accepting his kindness  gracefully, I gave a small bow. “Arigato Baluk san.”</p>
<p>“It’s  no problem at all. Come by again sometime you hear?”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Kaiya  and I bid our farewell and exited the shop, setting course for the  beach. It looks like we should hurry, I noted. My eyes squinted  against the sun’s rays. Clouds were starting to gather up ahead…  They weren’t dark or ominous but that could always change. Or it  may mean that night comes faster here.</p>
<p><u>Beach strip</u></p>
<p>“It  was sure nice of that guy to give us this for free, wasn’t  it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was.”</p>
<p>The two of us decided to  save half of the pastries to share with Haruka and her obaa chan. It  was the polite thing to do, as we intended to drop by without any  warning and such.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong?” I  could barely hear Kaiya over the waves.</p>
<p>Was something wrong?  I wonder if there is…A wide stretch of beach ran far ahead of us,  the ocean meeting its side. This place reminded me of something…Why  is my heart beating so fast? Its rhythm was pounding in my ears. I’ve  been here before, Ruka and I used to come here. But it was more than  that, something <em>important</em>. That word again! A shock shot up my  throat, constricting the airway. What’s going on? The reply was a  blinding flash of white light, only playing for my eyes to see. <em>‘The  receding water…A shore?’</em></p>
<p>“Michiru?” For a moment I  couldn’t say anything, the vision had taken me by surprise.</p>
<p>“…I  was just thinking…about how all the times I’ve been here and  never knew Ruka lived in this area.”</p>
<p>If only she knew.</p>
<p>“It  must be further down or partially hidden somewhere around here. But  don’t worry, we’ll find it.”</p>
<p>I nodded. Sure enough as  Kaiya had predicted, we found the small house a good ways down,  hidden from view by the foliage of various vegetation. It was what I  had expected to be- a small, cozy looking place. That would explain  Ruka’s preferences of living in an average apartment and her  discomfort she used to have towards staying at my place. But as we  neared, the knot in my stomach tightened again. What if Ruka really  was there and we were interrupting something important? Turning  around and forgetting the whole idea started to seem attractive.  Maybe I’ve been too impulsive lately…</p>
<p>“All right, we  just have to knock now.”</p>
<p>“Kaiya…”</p>
<p>She ignored  my words and proceeded to stubbornly rap the screen door.</p>
<p>“Anyone  home?”</p>
<p><strong>Knock, knock.</strong></p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>A  small, grandmother looking senior peered at us from the open screen  with a suspicious look plastered upon her face. She narrowed her  eyes, squinting up at the blonde who stood almost a quarter of the  woman’s height taller. Kaiya in turn stared back, not saying  anything. They both continued to rage in the silent staring contest  for a few moments longer, neither of them willing to back down. One  would wonder what was going through both of their heads as they did  so, perhaps my own; why was I still standing here letting it happen?</p>
<p>“You are Haruka’s obaa chan are you not?”</p>
<p>“What  if I am?”</p>
<p>“Sorry to intrude, we’re friends of Haruka. Is  she in right now?” By now I had made my way up the steps to the  front door as well. Maybe that wasn’t such a good idea, I began to  worry. Seeing how we both practically tower over her, she might think  we’re trying to intimidate her.</p>
<p>“She’s not here.” The  woman frowned. “If that’s all, you can leave now.”</p>
<p>A  bit hostile it seems. I wonder if Ruka really isn’t here or if  she’s covering for her. And I’ve never known Baluk san to lie…  It’s frustrating; there’s really nothing we can do even if it  were the later.</p>
<p>“Kaiya, please stop staring.” I gave an  exasperated sigh. “Well, if you see Haruka, would you please tell  her Michiru stopped by and-“</p>
<p>Kaiya held up our bakery  package in one hand and interrupted suddenly.</p>
<p>“We have  cookies.”</p>
<p><u>Inside the house, kitchen</u></p>
<p>I  can’t believe what just happened.</p>
<p>“The sugar cookies are  the best.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, ginger snaps have an edge over  them.”</p>
<p>Somehow Kaiya convinced the woman with the bribe of  cookies. How does that work? I looked to the new ‘friends’ who  were debating over the best tasting flavor.</p>
<p>“…Did you  really mean it when you said Haruka wasn’t around?”</p>
<p>The  addressed party took out her viewing glasses and adjusted them to her  face before replying, “That’s right. She went down to the city  pharmacy to pick up my prescription.”</p>
<p>So she really wasn’t  kidding…I was kind of hoping she was. If that’s the case then  there’s two options, we could chase after Ruka blindly or stay here  and wait. Only…I don’t think I could sit still here for very  long. As nice as this place is, it dwarfs in comparison to outside  where you see the ocean and breathe the salt air. That was why I  choose a place similar to the ocean by Tokyo after we left; I didn’t  want to feel locked away.</p>
<p>I shook my head; enough  daydreaming, we need a plan… And I think I’ve got it.</p>
<p>“Kaiya,  do you mind if I go out looking for Haruka?”</p>
<p>“But what if  she comes back after you leave…? Oh, I get it! Sure, I’m good  with that. Is it okay if I stay obaa chan?” Already she’s calling  the woman obaa chan. I wonder how Ruka will react when she sees  this?</p>
<p>“Fine by me.”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll see you two  later. Have fun and Kaiya? Behave.”</p>
<p>The blonde made a  pouting face that made me smile. But it was time to get going. If I  hurry I may catch Ruka on her way back.</p>
<p>I wonder if she  regretted leaving it all behind back then, when we departed on that  dark night. Silly me, of course she did; she still has her obaa  chan. And this town is everything a person could wish for in a  peaceful life.</p>
<p>What if…Ruka doesn’t want to leave? What  would I do then…? My feet stopped their steps so I could gaze at  the calm ocean.</p>
<p>I don’t understand anything…</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV, outside the pharmacy</u></p>
<p>“Well, that didn’t take as  long as I thought it would.” I stuffed the small white package into  the coat of my jacket.</p>
<p>Should I head back now? Hmm…I  crossed my arms in thought. Let’s see, if I did that she might just  send me off on another errand, like picking up more sweets for her.  Honestly, she shouldn’t eat so much of that stuff; any person that  age could heel over from over doing it. Which reminds me, why was she  on the roof anyway? What if she slipped and fell? It’s not like she  lives in a regular residential area or anything where someone could  hear her. She’d be helpless… Helpless? Scratch that. That was  quite the hammer throw back there. If I hadn’t had all that  experience with this stuff from before, I would’ve been knocked out  or worse!</p>
<p>“Okay, so I’m not going back. Not yet at least.”  Maybe I’ll just take a stroll around for a bit, stretch out the  legs. I was almost good as new, taking it easy really does pay  off.</p>
<p>With that settled I began to walk, relatively aimlessly  without a set guide or particular path. That’s the way I liked  things to be, letting everything fall into place. Some people call it  fate and some call it destiny. Although I accept things as they come,  I don’t believe in such nonsense. Michi is more of that type. Oh.  Crap. I forgot to call her, stupid errand…I wonder if she’d take  the ‘it may be destiny’ card. No, probably not. Then when I see  her again she’ll ignore me for the rest of the week! Suddenly my  happy stroll felt quite gloomy, it’s the feeling like you’re the  only one with a storm cloud following you. Maybe I should stay here  for awhile…The ocean senshi wasn’t my only concern; I mean, Michi  would get over it eventually but Kaiya would <em>kill</em> me if she  found out. The little brat is stronger than she looks, if she really  wanted to hurt you she’d do a good job at of it.</p>
<p>An array  of bright colors suddenly attracted my attention from the depressing  interlude. A flower shop? I found myself standing at the open  entrance, having stopped in my tracks while analyzing each one with  curiosity. They all looked very healthy…It looks like they paid  special attention to the roses and lilies. Nice, but it wasn’t what  I was looking for. Hmm…Ah, there it is! That was when a particular  species captured my gaze. A bouquet of violets… The sight got me  feeling very sentimental. People don’t usually think much of the  flower, common as it is. However, it was <em>her</em> favorite; she  always loved the simple things in life.</p>
<p>“Heh…” I waved  over the shopkeeper. “I’ll take this one.”</p>
<p>“Yes  sir.”</p>
<p>So Karma strikes again.</p>
<p><u>Park  area</u></p>
<p>Carrying my latest purchase I made my way through  the town’s only established park. It wasn’t much, nothing  extravagantly fancy like those places in Tokyo. It was…  simple…Mostly grass, trees and any naturally growing flowers  littered the area. The caretaker must’ve slacked off somewhere; the  weeds were starting to take root. Don’t they know that this entire  place isn’t a playground? There was a sandpit with swings somewhere  in here but it only took up a small portion of this area, hardly  worth mentioning. In fact, if you asked anyone what was the most  memorable structure in this place they wouldn’t say the playground,  they would say it’s ‘D’amour’. Who knows what love sick fool  named it but that’s what its called. The structure itself is  another story; it’s a beautifully decorated, white marble fountain  in this park’s center. It’s been around as long as I can  remember. From what I recall, it would run all day and night, a  perfect place where couples would come to watch the stars and bath in  the serene atmosphere. They believed it was an epitome of romance.</p>
<p>It should actually be called the epitome of death…</p>
<p>A  chill ran down my spine as I neared; the sound of running water  steadily increased, as it did so, my heart copied the action. Three  years was it? I entered the clear area.</p>
<p>“Everyone must be  off eating supper.” Couldn’t blame them, the sun would set in a  short few hours.</p>
<p>However, in that seemingly open background  stood the ‘epitome of romance’. My feet silently guided the rest  of me to the marble structure, taking the time to hesitate every so  often. It shouldn’t be scary, it’s in the past…</p>
<p>When I  had finally reached my destination I stood there, unmoving, unwilling  to sit upon its perfect, cold surface. It only looks perfect but I  can see its not; the blood stains can never be entirely  removed.</p>
<p>“Long time no see… mom.”</p>
<p><u>Obaa  chan’s house, Kaiya’s Pov</u></p>
<p>Obaa chan and I finished  most of the cookies and had settled in the living room. I guess the  both of us were extremely bored because we decided to peek through  some of obaa chan’s photo albums. There were so many pictures,  mostly ones of when she was young and a few of when she was married.  She even had an entire album with only photographs of Haruka in it.</p>
<p>But…there was something wrong, a flaw with the  images.</p>
<p>“Where are the <em>photos</em> of your kids?</p>
<p>The  old lady gave such a sad smile, it made me wonder what I said that  was so wrong.</p>
<p>“I never had any children; my husband divorced  from me a year after we were wed.”</p>
<p>“B-But Haruka is your  grand-daughter isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“As you probably suspect,  we’re not related by blood.”</p>
<p>Is that what Haruka meant  when she said she was an orphan? But what about her parents, does  that mean they abandoned her? Or…</p>
<p>“How much do you really  know about Haruka? …Not very much, judging by your facial  expression.” She sighed.</p>
<p>That’s true, I really didn’t  know much about my friend, I’ve always thought her to be an  easy-going person. Although, she’s sometimes becomes moody but that  was normal wasn’t it? Everyone gets like that right?</p>
<p>“To  put it simply…”The senior continued, “I found her.”</p>
<p>“Found  her?” My eyes widened.</p>
<p>“Or she found me, whatever you  would like to call it…It was all over town the next morning, such  an unforgivable act.”</p>
<p>“Then…Haruka was abandoned?” For  some reason I had to know, was she like me? I didn’t want to think  it was the other possibility; it would be too cruel.</p>
<p>“Abandoned?  My dear child, if it were only that. You see, Haruka’s parent’s  weren’t officially married, it was an on and off relationship.  However, the day her father finally planned on taking her mother’s  heart, he instead took her life.”</p>
<p><u>Park fountain,  Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>They buried her in the town cemetery…but  it was only her shell, the spirit wasn’t there. I can feel it, a  piece of her was still lingering at this place, the place she took  her last breath while screaming for help. I’m sure you remember  that day as clear as I do, mother.</p>
<p>We weren’t rich or poor,  reasonably well off without that man I called ‘father’. There  wasn’t anything special about us; you weren’t married to a  wealthy entrepreneur and I was a normal seven-year-old kid. An  ordinary, simple life was what you called it.</p>
<p><em>“It may be  simple, but I truly treasure it and you, Haruka.”</em></p>
<p>Wouldn’t  it have been paradise if it could’ve stayed simple? Going to church  every Sunday, picking violets every Wednesday and going out for walks <em>everyday</em>? Do you remember the story time evenings where we  would become pirates, sailing the seven seas or pretend to be secret  agents? I do…Being with you was one of the happiest times in my  life; it was always warm when you were around, especially when you  held me during all those times I cried… I cried a lot back then,  didn’t I? The kids at schools would always call me, ‘a stupid  crybaby who always runs to mommy.’ So what if it they did? It was  true.</p>
<p><em>“Mom!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ruka? Why are you  crying?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The kids at school keep making fun of the  way I look.” I sniffed heavily.</em></p>
<p><em>“Hush…I’m right here,  don’t cry.” She took me in her arms, letting my weary body rest  comfortably in her lap. “What did they say?”</em></p>
<p>But she  probably already knew what I would say.</p>
<p><em>“They made fun of  my hair and eye color... Why am I so different?”</em></p>
<p><em>“You mean  you don’t want your hair color to be like mom’s?”</em></p>
<p><em>“No!  I do like it, a lot. I even want to grow my hair as long as yours  someday. It’s just…”</em></p>
<p><em>Her arms circled me tighter as she  let out a soft sigh. “You are who you are. Everyone is different  but inside we’re the same…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Really?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Really.  Now how about we go get some supper?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yeah!”</em></p>
<p>It  could have stayed that way if he didn’t come back. If only he  didn’t... I remember that day was the coldest a fall season could  produce, the day he returned. We were doing the usual story routine  when the knock came at the door. However, unlike me, you were not  perturbed. Acting as though nothing was unusual you went and answered  that call. The door swung open and then you greeted the stranger with  an embrace. I remember thinking ‘Why did she do that?’ and ‘Who  is that guy?’ When you told me he was my father I thought it was a  joke; he looked like some bum off the street and there was a strong,  disgusting smell of alcohol reeking from him. It couldn’t have been  true.</p>
<p><em>“You’re lying!”</em></p>
<p>Until then, I’ve  never argued back with you, even if I had disagreed. I’ve never  asked for anything we couldn’t afford. So why didn’t you listen  to me this one time? No matter what I said you ignored it all and  went with that man anyway. I was angry, to the point where I threw a  fit after you left. I remember throwing things in my room and  punching the walls in frustration, anything to keep from crying. If I  cried, I wouldn’t be able to resist your warm embrace any longer. I  didn’t want to forget and forgive, I didn’t want to think it was  nothing and could easily be overlooked. Most of all, I didn’t want  you to leave me, especially not for him! For that time alone I  struggled with myself. I asked myself over and over, should I hate  you? However it was a foolish alternative that would never see light;  what I really wanted was you to come home safe. Having realized that  I decided to follow.</p>
<p>“Didn’t expect that, did you?” I  slowly reached out to the violets that I had bought earlier, and took  one, holding its face lightly in my fingertips.</p>
<p>I was  surprised that the two of you chose to come here, to this fountain.  Even more so, that you two appeared to be talking nothing but sweet  whispers under the star filled sky. It really did make me wonder; for  a moment, I thought maybe I was being too suspicious for no reason,  maybe you would be happier like this. How terribly mistaken I  was…When I was about to leave I heard loud yelling.</p>
<p><em>“You  like simple things? Think I’m so simple then bitch?”</em></p>
<p>I watched him beat you with a fury of fists. I heard you scream  but no one came.</p>
<p><em>What should I do? Mom! Mom! Why isn’t  anybody coming?</em></p>
<p>I don’t know if you knew his last words  to you before he took your life but it was-</p>
<p><em>“I love  you.”</em></p>
<p>Disgusting isn’t it?</p>
<p>You hit the cement  floor so hard and there was so much blood. Did you die on impact?  Some part of me hoped it was painless…After that, I ran all the way  into town screaming at the top of my lungs for help despite my own  frantic sobs. A few times, I even slipped and fell, earning myself  bruises that would appear the next day. It stung but it didn’t  matter…</p>
<p>When everything seemed to be hopeless obaa chan  found me. I didn’t know why she was out this late but I didn’t  care, at that point I was begging, anyone would do. She called Baluk  san and the paramedics without wasting any time… But…By the time  we got back, you were already gone. If you died because of me… I’m  sorry. I don’t know what else to say, nothing could make up for it  or bring you back. All I can do is miss you everyday and pray that  you’re happy wherever you are now.</p>
<p>“If you’re watching,  then you know that I’ve gotten stronger. Everything is different  now; there’s a lot on the line but I won’t lose.” I gave the  bouquet one final pat and turned to leave. “Until next  time…”</p>
<p>There’s one more place I would like to see…</p>
<p><u>Obaa  chan’s house, Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“No way…” That’s so  sad, no one deserves that...</p>
<p>“Well, her father was found  dead the next day in a dirty alleyway. The authorities reported that  he was hit by a car; everything in the autopsy confirmed it.”</p>
<p>It  doesn’t matter how he died, I’m just glad that murderer is dead.  If he were still alive I’d be tempted to hunt him down  myself!</p>
<p>“Did you take her in after that?”</p>
<p>“I did,  but it wasn’t so easy. She was a sad sight to see, for many days I  had to coax her to eat and go outside. It was like she lost the will  to do anything, she didn’t care anymore…All she really wanted to  do was cry…”</p>
<p>“…” I know the feeling…</p>
<p>“I  was very worried about her first day of school; she had gotten into a  few fights. Eventually, really it started to become a problem…so I  tried to transfer her to a different school.”</p>
<p>“What  happened, did things get better?”</p>
<p>“She met Kaioh  Michiru.”</p>
<p><u>School grounds, Michiru’s POV</u></p>
<p>I’ve  looked everywhere else, either she’s here or she went home.  Checking time for myself I looked over my shoulder to see the sun  beginning to set. It had started to become cooler as well…  goosebumps started to play across my arms. I wonder how cold it’s  going to get; hopefully not that much, I wasn’t dressed for  it.</p>
<p>“It won’t take long.” I assured myself. It’ll only  be a quick check and I leave.</p>
<p>With that, I took my first step  into the familiar junior high school building.</p>
<p>The janitors  must still be here if the school is still open. However, it probably  won’t be for much longer. If that’s the case, I should take the  main route on both floors; that way I can cover more ground in less  time.</p>
<p>With that settled I stepped forward, finding myself  feeling uneasy; things appeared quite different when no one was  around. It was colder and very quiet, granting the surroundings a  hollow effect. They used to hang the student’s works of art on  these walls but I notice they’ve stopped that little tradition. A  pity, such displayed talents could improve the ambience immensely;  that’s what art is for isn’t it? My thoughts were rudely  interrupted when I a fork in the hall met me. Trivial, from here I  could go either way; this place goes around in a circle. I turned  left and continued onwards. A circle, such a way my life used to  represent.</p>
<p>Everyday it would be the same thing; go to school,  attend to student council, give various clubs direction, come home,  eat supper, practice the violin and then sleep. Then I’d get up the  next morning. Everything was so predictable and I hated it. Life  wasn’t really there anymore, it seemed surreal. Soon I found myself  saying what people wanted to say, never what was really on my mind…  just another thing to be used. That’s what it felt like, that these  people wanted to use me until I was useless and ready to be thrown  away. So I rebelled, I wouldn’t let anyone close. Another vicious  cycle would began…one that I feared I could never break free  of.</p>
<p>I passed the hallway trophy case, never stopping to  lavish attention over the pile of awards with my name on them. It  wasn’t worth my time.</p>
<p>Finding that I’ve made a complete  cycle I decided it was time to search the second floor; it was  obvious Ruka wasn’t wandering around down here. So I took the  staircase up, all the while pondering whether I was really wasting my  time or not. It wasn’t a waste of time I concluded, it was another  memorable experience…only, there was one selfish aspect to this  search; I would like to see my old homeroom one last time. It was  where it all began after all.</p>
<p>I only had to walk a little  way, the room was fairly close; two doors down to my right. Reaching  the destination I paused, staring at the door handle with  nervousness. What if it was locked? Slowly my hand reached out and  grasped the cool metal, twisting it agonizingly clockwise  until…</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>It opened.</p>
<p>“Ah…so it  isn’t locked. I’m glad.” I gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>With  the worst of it over I swung the door open and tread forward into the  warm air. Instantly my fondness for this room came back, my stiff  muscles started to unthaw and relax. It was…comfortable, the way  I’ve always remembered it. Everything was the same, only it appears  that I’ve changed. But that’s all right, I don’t…regret this  change.</p>
<p>I began walking up the rows, examining each desk  through a quick scan. There was something I wanted to find…it  should be around here somewhere…</p>
<p>“Oh, here it is.” I  stopped at a desk at the very back of the middle row. With a gentle  touch I made small circles on the surface, trailing the roughly  engraved pen marks with lax precision. This was Ruka’s work…She  really used to be a troublemaker back then. The teachers would always  berate her for her effort calling it ‘damage of school property’,  however, I became used to thinking it as abstract art. If only she  didn’t use the school desk…</p>
<p>I sat down on its seat and  closed my eyes for a moment, trying to remember where I used to sit.  If memory serves me well, it had been by the main windows…I turned  my head and inspected the perspective feeling slightly amused. This  was probably how Ruka saw me…I wonder what she thought? It  embarrassed me back then to think about it but strangely it doesn’t  now; I used to always feel someone’s eyes on the back of my head.  Of course I didn’t have to guess who it was, I could see her  staring out of my peripheral vision.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>She  really made an unusual first impression the morning she first  presented herself to our class, the bruised cheek made quite a few  eyes widen, mine included. It didn’t take long for the whispering  to start, rumors were flying all over the school by the end of the  day. Little pieces of gossip shrouding her past were taking the  spotlight in every conversation. Because it was a small town, almost  everyone was mildly aware to a degree of her family predicament.  However, the most any person knew was that her parents were deceased.  Just like mine…</p>
<p>I remember an acquaintance of mine wouldn’t  let the subject drop and babbled continually between classes. She  went on about how the guys on the track team thought Haruka was  actually the one who killed her parents.</p>
<p><em>“You shouldn’t  listen to everything they say; they’re only jealous that Haruka out  ran them all.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But what if it’s true?”</em></p>
<p><em>“It’s  not.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What? B-but, how do you know? Michiru?”</em></p>
<p>I  said it wasn’t true without a second thought and left the puzzled  girl behind in the hallway. It had been bothering me for some time  since I laid eyes on you, my sixth sense as we both call it now. The  feelings weren’t very strong at first but they gradually increased  as the days started to stroll by; perhaps it was because we were in  the same building for those countless hours a day. At first I ignored  it, it wasn’t an uncommon experience for me; many times it would go  away… Maybe not immediately but they always did.</p>
<p>It was  quite the surprise for me, hers didn’t… they became  stronger.</p>
<p>One day I couldn’t let it go on any longer, I was  at my limit; I had to know why. By then I had become quite irritated  in my movements, it became difficult to sit still or concentrate on  anything during classes. To add onto that, I fell into constant mood  swings of depression for no particular reason. All I knew… was they  weren’t for my own reasons. It was then that I concluded that she  was making me feel like this.</p>
<p>I waited until everyone left  after the dismissal bell just outside the school entrance; I noticed  that the blonde tended to drag behind everyone else, probably wanted  to avoid the crowds…Who could blame her though? No one had taken to  her, a natural loner. Although there were many of our classmates who  respected her talents they found her character too mysterious and  unapproachable. I thought the same way at first…</p>
<p>When  Haruka didn’t leave as expected I became curious and made my way  inside, searching for the blonde. It took awhile, I remember checking  the entire first floor as I did earlier. I thought I might’ve  missed her, then allowed myself to feel slightly rejected at the  possible failure. But…As I turned to leave a new light came to  mind. Why not try feeling her out? At that time I had a pretty good  grip of my growing powers, even before I became Sailor Neptune. It  shouldn’t be too difficult, if she was still in the school her  energy shouldn’t have disappeared quite yet. For once the idea  wasn’t more difficult than saying it. I walked upstairs and caught  on almost immediately, it was so strong I wondered why I didn’t  feel it earlier.</p>
<p>I followed by the increasing throbbing  inside my head, up until I finally found her. She was in the school’s  music room surprisingly enough…But not to practice an instrument,  only seeming content to stare outside the window.</p>
<p>Haruka  didn’t seem to notice me so I stood there and waited. For a moment  I wanted to run; the atmosphere felt so heavy that it was  suffocating. It took all the courage I had… one of the hardest  things I had to do up that point of my life. But I finally asked  you.</p>
<p><em>“Why are you crying?” The blonde quickly pivoted  on the spot.</em></p>
<p><em>“…What? I don’t know what you’re talking  about, you’re the one who’s crying.”</em></p>
<p>I remember  that when I touched my face I felt the tears and realized that you  were right. But they weren’t my tears. They were yours.</p>
<p>Ever  since that incident we slowly grew closer at little steps at a time.  Maybe it was destiny that we met…When I later found out that we  were both sailor senshi I really began to think that.</p>
<p>“Hmm…It  looks like the sun is setting…Haruka probably went back by now.”  I probably should too.</p>
<p>Kaiya is probably wondering where I am  right now. I stood and took slow steps towards the room entrance,  careful to keep memorize each detail in my mind. The warm air, the  clear windows, the way the desks were lined up, even the way my  footsteps sounded as I walked. Perhaps this was one place that I  truly missed, it had nothing to do with today’s troubles. Even so,  I couldn’t stay; living in a memory isn’t the way I want to live.</p>
<p>After a last glance around the classroom I closed the door  and left…I left but I didn’t head downstairs, instead my feet  automatically walked down the hall in the opposite direction. This  feeling again… I hope it isn’t a past trace, it would be too  disheartening. Near the end of the corridor I spotted a thin line of  sunlight spill out into the darkness. Another open door…Does that  mean someone else is…I held my breath, not daring to  think.</p>
<p>Finally at its entrance I blinked back as my eyes  adjusted to the sudden intensity of golden red. And at its center  stood a familiar figure. We were only separated for a day but it  feels like it was a lifetime ago… Again you don’t notice me and  again I wanted to run. What will you say if you see me? Will you tell  me to leave…? And…</p>
<p>“Why are you crying?”</p>
<p>Haruka  turned around very slowly, her eyes flickered with a light of  surprise but in a split second it shifted once more. Those eyes…How  could someone’s eyes be so dark but bright at  once?</p>
<p>“Mi…chi?”</p>
<p>When she spoke my name the  trance had been broken and I started to run as my life depended on  it. Maybe it did.</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s Pov</u></p>
<p><u></u>That was  Michi wasn’t it? Or were my eyes playing tricks on me? If it only  had been the one or the other I might have believed it, but not if <em>both</em> my eyes and ears are sensing the same thing!</p>
<p>“Michi!  Wait up!” Why is she running away? “Michiru!”</p>
<p>My eyes  caught the flash of aqua dashing down the stairs at the opposite end  of the corridor. Shit she’s fast! Instead of following the same  route I shot down the staircase to my immediate right, maybe I could  catch a sight of her before she leaves. A question kept repeating  itself over in my mind, why did you follow?</p>
<p>I practically  flew down the steps and jumped the last few, my feet hit the floor  with a loud thud. The moment of stillness was short lived when a  consistent beat caught my ears. She’s almost at the exit!</p>
<p>“Ahh…”  That way!</p>
<p>The first exit I stumbled upon I was outside again.  A sudden breeze whipped at my jacket but it was easily ignored.</p>
<p>“Michiru!” I finally spotted her. She stood at the gate  entrance, seeming to hesitate. That too, was short lived. You’re  not getting away!</p>
<p>In seconds I had caught up and my hand shot  out, grasping her wrist in a strong hold.</p>
<p>“Michiru, why…?”  What? “You…you’re crying?” I immediately released her but  stood my ground. What I really wanted to do that moment was hold her  but I couldn’t; if I even took a step towards her she might run off  again.</p>
<p>“I’m not crying…you are.”</p>
<p>“What do…you  mean? You’re the one with tears coming out of their eyes.”</p>
<p>She  shook her head. And to my surprise, before I could react she had me  in a tight embrace.</p>
<p>“Not everyone expresses their sadness  the same way.”</p>
<p>It took me a moment to comprehend her words.  She said I was the one crying…But at the same time, I wasn’t.  Does that mean she’s crying for me?</p>
<p>There were so many  things that I didn’t understand…Then again, perhaps this was one  of those things that didn’t logical words pasted to it, but  meaningful feelings.</p>
<p>“Arigato Michi” I returned the hug.  “But still, why did you run?”</p>
<p>“Because…you hate to see  yourself cry.”</p>
<p><u>Obaa chan’s house, Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Made a difference huh?”</p>
<p>“What’s  wrong? Obaa chan?”</p>
<p>“I was remembering something odd that  happened with Haruka awhile back.”</p>
<p>“Like what?”</p>
<p>“Well…she  seemed to have adjusted to the school life somewhat but…She came  home one day with a strange air to her, there was this new flicker in  her eye that I’ve never seen before.”</p>
<p>“…You think it  was because of Michiru?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know to be honest.  However, that following week she would stare out at the ocean for  hours at a time like she had lost something very special to her. One  might describe the mood as… longing.”</p>
<p>Longing? Okay, was  Haruka missing her parents or something? Hmm…No, that wouldn’t  make sense. Obaa chan said it was ‘strange’ and Haruka lost them  both awhile ago by the sound of it. And I don’t think it was  Michiru either; I thought it was only a short time ago that Haruka  decided she</p>
<p>liked Michiru in  ‘that’ way. So what was it…? Darn, now I’m curious!</p>
<p><strong>Knock,  knock.</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“It’s probably Haruka.” Obaa chan mused.  Strangely she didn’t seem worried at Haruka’s lateness the least  bit. It was almost as though she <em>expected</em> it. “So, we’re  running plan A correct?”</p>
<p>Plan A was something the two of us  concocted to get even with Haruka. There was no plan B, if A failed  then it would go along the lines of improvising.</p>
<p>“Yup, I’ll  get into position.” I hid myself just around the corner of the  front entrance, barely out of view. It was pay back time and I wanted  some answer.</p>
<p>Obaa chan opened the door and greeted Haruka.  Wait, Michiru was back too? Hmm…This already changed things a bit.  I hope obaa chan can deal.</p>
<p>“Welcome back. Michiru san, would  you please step over here?” The senior grasped Michiru’s hand  lightly and pulled her well inside and clear of the door  entrance.</p>
<p>“Sure, but why?”</p>
<p>Obaa chan ignored  Michiru’s question and stopped Haruka with a hand gesture. “Stay  where you are for a second.” I could see Haruka raise an eyebrow at  the request.</p>
<p>“What are you up to?” She accused. That was  when Michiru spotted me but I made a quick motion of a finger to my  lips, telling her to keep quiet. Please don’t tell!</p>
<p>“Me?  Nothing…It’s actually-“</p>
<p>“ME!” I darted around the  corner and tackled the blonde as hard as I could.</p>
<p>Haruka  stumbled back a step, until we both tumbled down the steps onto the  stretch of sand. Everything was spinning but I heard on as long as I  could before the hold was forcefully undone by dizziness. The feeling  faded quickly though and before I knew it I was up on my feet,  brushing off gritty grains of sand stuck to my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Click.</strong></p>
<p>Behind us, I could hear Obaa closing the  door. That means it was time to get started…I approached the other  blonde, holding back the urge to slap her right there and  then.</p>
<p>“Kaiya! What the hell- Oof!” Haruka had tried to get  up but I shoved her back down with a hand to her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why  don’t you say something useful for a change.”</p>
<p>“?”   Seeing her puzzled expression I allowed her to stand up. She then  tried to step back, away from me but froze when her feet meet chilled  liquid. She couldn’t get out of this.</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb,  why did you run off like that without telling anyone? Especially  Michiru! I thought she was special to you!”</p>
<p>“She is…Look,  I was going to call, it just… slipped my mind.” She mumbled the  last bit.</p>
<p>“Slipped your mind?” Or you just didn’t  care.</p>
<p>“I’m not up for this, can we talk about it  later?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Why are you being so  stubborn?”</p>
<p>“Stop trying to change the question. What’s  going on with you Haruka? Everyone is worried about the way you’ve  been acting lately.”</p>
<p>“…” She stared at the ground.</p>
<p>I  gave a small sigh. It really doesn’t look like she’s going to  talk. “Let me guess. Obaa chan called you, pretending to be sick  and you didn’t want anyone to get involved so you came by  yourself.” Out of the corner of my eye I saw Haruka’s head shot  up. I’m… tired of people special to me abandoning me. I don’t  want you to become like my parents Haruka… “Don’t you know  that’s so cliché? Stop trying to play hero all the time. You  keep doing this! You say you’re holding back your feelings for  Michiru because you don’t want to burden her with troubles, but  you’re really concerned for your own sanity aren’t you? ‘What  if she rejects me’ that’s what really going through your head  isn’t it? And then you think by going off on your own you’ll  spare everyone trouble? Give me a break! Why do you think we came  looking for you in the first place? …What kind of idiot are you?  Just stop it Haruka, stop being so selfish!”</p>
<p>Everything  seemed to freeze; not even the sound of the waves could reach our  ears.</p>
<p>I lunged forward and gripped Haruka’s jacket collar,  “Say something!” and then I shook her.</p>
<p>“What’s to say!  You’re so smart, you’ve figured it out all right?” She shouted.</p>
<p>With that declaration I released my hold and stepped back,  still warily watching the blonde. The expressions on her face shifted  from anger to self-pity and then finally to confusion. A part of me  felt guilty for forcing the subject but I knew Michiru would have  dropped it and carried on as though it never happened. Nothing would  change, so I took it for my responsibility.</p>
<p>“Why all those  questions then Kaiya?” But her question really was ‘Did you have  to do that?’</p>
<p>“…I really wanted to hear it from you.  That’s why. Although…since I haven’t known you as long as  Michiru has, I already figured you’d be this way.”</p>
<p>“What  I’m trying to say is if you have problems at least tell Michiru  okay?” As I finished the sentence I looked up to see Obaa chan wave  to me from the living room window, signaling us to come back. I’ve  said all I wanted to…As long as Haruka gets it, I’m happy.</p>
<p>“Looks like we have to start making supper…are you  coming?”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s POV</u></p>
<p>“…I’m not  hungry.” I was actually feeling a bit on the sick side. It was a  bit shocking to have my exact thoughts being shoved into my face so  forcefully. That Kaiya really is something isn’t she? I didn’t  have to tell her and she figured it all out. But even then…It made  me a bit sad because I couldn’t be the one to tell her about my <em>real</em> problems. Being a sailor soldier, that business has  nothing to do with her.</p>
<p>“Listen, tomorrow is your big race  isn’t it? You might as well have a good time while you’re here  right? Oh and just between us…” She bent down to whisper into my  ear, “Obaa chan couldn’t stop talking about you all afternoon.  She really missed you.”</p>
<p>“She did?” Baluk san mentioned  something along those lines earlier today too, but I thought he was  joking.</p>
<p>“She really talked up quite a storm, saying how her  precious Ruka was chasing her dream… All your races, she taped them  all! At first I didn’t believe it myself but then she showed me the  pile, it was enormous! Believe me.”</p>
<p>The rest of the  blonde’s cheerful chatter droned on but I didn’t listen. When I  left three years ago, I thought obaa chan disowned me and moved on  with her life. But here I find she’s been watching me and cheering  me on? Plus Kaiya makes her sound like my number one fan…I can’t  believe it.</p>
<p>My hand brushed a bulge in my coat pocket,  reminding me of the medication. That’s right, I still have to drop  this off.</p>
<p>“…She’s thinks really highly of you  and-“</p>
<p>“Kaiya?”</p>
<p>“Yeah?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go  back, okay?”</p>
<p>The blonde grinned, making me smile as well.  That murderous look on her face earlier was pretty scary, I like it  better when she’s smiling.</p>
<p>“Obaa chan, what can I do?”  Kaiya rushed ahead.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ve decided on doing a  barbecue, so why don’t you get the hamburger buns up from the  freezer?”</p>
<p>Michiru and I watched the enthusiastic teen dash  into the house before Michi sent me a worried glance.</p>
<p>“It’s  all right now.”</p>
<p>“…I’m glad.” Somehow she didn’t  sound like it. I wonder obaa chan has been telling her…Or maybe  she’s still mad at me? Kaiya was furious at first, so what were the  chances Michi wouldn’t feel the same? She was good at hiding her  feelings after all.</p>
<p>The moment was interrupted when Obaa chan  yelled, “Haruka, stop acting like a lovesick dog and help me start  the barbecue!”</p>
<p>“Obaa chan!” Why did she have to say  that? “She doesn’t know what she’s talking about.” I quickly  told Michi. Without daring to wait for her reply I dashed off,  reminding myself to give that granny of mine a piece of my mind.  “Obaa chan, why did you have to say that? Now she’ll think I’m  weird.”</p>
<p>“What are you getting so upset about? Unless…you  really do like her.” She grinned.</p>
<p>“I…Uhh…”</p>
<p>“Don’t  worry about it so much child, things are going to be all right. It’s  not the end of the world…” She seemed to mutter the last  bit.</p>
<p>“Kaiya told you didn’t she?” I want to kill that  brat!</p>
<p>“Kaiya? No, I’ve actually known something like this  would happen for some time now. Although it was nice to meet the girl  for once... Anyway, let’s get started.”</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>Dinner was incredible fulfilling; it wasn’t  entirely due to the food though, but because we were all together.  So…I finally got to meet Ruka’s obaa chan. She’s quite the  woman. While I nervously waited for Kaiya and Ruka to finish their  ‘talk’ she told me something which surprised me very  much.</p>
<p><em>“Don’t worry, they’ll be fine.”</em></p>
<p><em>“But  they’ve been arguing so much lately, it’s hard to believe they  won’t try to kill each other.”</em></p>
<p><em>Obaa chan chuckled at  that. “You’re probably aware that not everyone expresses their  feelings the same way do you not?” I held my breath. “You heard  her, didn’t you? Her silent tears?”</em></p>
<p><em>“What do…you  mean?” How did she know?</em></p>
<p><em>“I’ve known that girl for a  good while now…It’s something I’ve sensed. Although she’s  physically stopped crying she was still being torn apart inside.  Until she met you, she had no other friends. That’s how I know;  without understanding there is no friendship.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…You’re  quite wise.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Well, I have been around for awhile.” She  chuckled before standing up and walking over to the window. “Would  you do me a favor Michiru san?”</em></p>
<p><em>A favor? “Which  is?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Take care of Haruka.”</em></p>
<p><em>“What?” I don’t’  understand, she makes it sound like she’s going to…No, it can’t  be that! “You don’t mean…?”</em></p>
<p><em>“…When you reach that  age, you know when it is close at hand. Though the exact cause is not  known, it matters not as the result will always be the same. It  happens to us all. Please give me your word that you won’t tell  Haruka? I wouldn’t want her to worry; she has that important race  tomorrow.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I…”</em></p>
<p><em>“Promise me.”</em></p>
<p><em>“…I  understand.”</em></p>
<p>I wish I could tell Ruka, it was very  tempting. The two of us were sitting outside on the sand by  ourselves; Kaiya and obaa chan were inside washing the dishes at this  moment. But what should I do? I gave her my word…I found myself  looking to the blood red sky for advice…then to the sand and  finally the ocean. The three different entities stood by their oath  of silence, neither willing to convey any hints or words of wisdom.  Frustrating really…the ocean wasn’t being cooperative for once.  Did it really think I could make this choice on my own?</p>
<p>“Isn’t  the sunset beautiful?” I heard Haruka comment.</p>
<p>“Yes, I  suppose so.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You aren’t still mad at me  are you?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, it’s nothing like  that.” Far from that.</p>
<p>“…Don’t laugh, okay? But I used  to have this dream that I could fly.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I  know it’s kind of weird, but I was the wind.”</p>
<p>That makes  sense in a way, Haruka was the senshi of the wind after all. “So  what happened?”</p>
<p>“Well…” She looked thoughtful. “There  was nothing but blue sky with the ocean beneath me. But then I  reached the shore and I saw myself, as a person staring at the water.  They didn’t seem to notice me, just…staring. It was kind of  creepy actually. Then I sudden became closer and closer… untill I  hit myself! That was when I woke up.”</p>
<p>I was at a loss for  words, it certainly wasn’t anything I’ve experienced before.</p>
<p>“I  was standing right here.” Haruka stood up and walked forward to  demonstrate.</p>
<p>As she did so, my vision started to become  blurred again. Instantly I knew the cause.</p>
<p>Is this your  advice?</p>
<p><u>Past</u></p>
<p><em>I wonder where Haruka is…The  kids at school said they saw her down here. Only, all I see is sand.  Unperturbed I continued forward thinking of what I would say when I  meet the blonde. Would I yell at her for going ahead like that? Or  would I break down and cry? I looked to the ocean, hoping it would  help me think. It really has been awhile…Only…things will become  difficult from here on. There isn’t a lot of time left, I have to  find her before it’s too late!</em></p>
<p><em>I took a few hasty steps  forward until I heard a voice call out to me. “Michiru?” When I  looked up ahead I saw Haruka sitting behind a patch of raised ground.  No wonder I couldn’t find her until now! “Hey, how are you?”  She smiled, motioning me over with a wave of her hand.</em></p>
<p><em>How  can she act like nothings happened? Or… doesn’t she know?</em></p>
<p><em>“What’s wrong? Are you still worried about me running  away from my powers? If you are, don’t worry because I agreed to  it…Michiru?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The kids say that you’ve been staring  out at the ocean for five days straight…Why?”</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka  seemed to freeze momentarily.</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh, that? It’s nothing  really.”</em></p>
<p><em>“Nothing?” I tried to keep my anger down. All  her words stung so much…</em></p>
<p><em>Before I was aware, I felt her  arms hold my shoulders trying to comfort me. “What’s wrong?  What’s bothering you?”</em></p>
<p><em>Unable to keep the secret to  myself I finally blurted, “Why did you run away?” I forced myself  to look up into her startled eyes, searching for the answer. She had  to know by now.</em></p>
<p><em>“You…followed.” Her eyes widened. By now  they had started to tear like my own. “Why…?”</em></p>
<p><u>End</u></p>
<p>“I  missed you so much.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What did you say?” I was  back. However, it unnerved me that the first thing I saw was Haruka’s  face being so close to mine.</p>
<p>“Nothing! I was just…”</p>
<p>“Off  in your little world again huh? You’ve got to stop doing that so  much, I was actually worried.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“It’s  no problem… Cold?” I think she saw me shiver. Before I could  protest she had draped her jacket over my shoulders and held me tight  to her side with a free arm. “How’s that? Feel better?”</p>
<p>“…Yes,  arigato…” But…My head is feeling so muddled from that  vision…And this place is so relaxing… I could just fall  asleep…</p>
<p><u>Overhead \ town central</u></p>
<p>Kaolinite  stared down smugly at the crowd of people below.</p>
<p>“Let’s  see those pesky sailor senshi find us now… They’re probably  scratching their heads in another city.” She laughed. “Now go and  capture a pure heart!”</p>
<p>The egg then flew away from her  outstretched palm.</p>
<p><u><br />
  Obaa chan’s house,</u> <u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Whew…We’re almost done.” I sighed. Obaa chan  decided that she would dry the dishes while I washed. It wasn’t as  that I disliked washing, drying would have been the same to me either  way. Although, I was a bit perplexed at why she had insisted so.</p>
<p>“Do  you really like drying dishes obaa chan?” She laughed, making me  feel as though I had just made a fool of myself. “What’s so  funny?”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing really…It’s just an old  tradition. When Haruka lived here she’d always wash and I’d  always dry. See?” She held the towel to my face and I noticed it  had Obaa chan’s name on it. “That girl would tease me so…one  day she brought this home for me. She said ‘there, now you’re a  real professional’. We really had a good laugh after  that.”</p>
<p>“Haruka sounds so cheerful…” For no reason?</p>
<p>“I  was surprised as well. It was during that week I told you about  earlier, when she would stare out at the ocean…”</p>
<p><strong>Lub  dub.</strong><u></u></p>
<p><u></u>What…was that? I released the plate I had  been holding back into the soapy water. I thought I heard another  heart beat…But it didn’t make me feel warm, it left me feeling  cold as if the whole room had been thrown into a freezer!</p>
<p>“What’s  the matter? Do you wish to try drying instead?” She teased.  “Kaiya?”</p>
<p><strong>Lub dub, lub dub…</strong></p>
<p>That isn’t  my heart that’s beating.</p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p>“AH!” I  threw my arms up. just as the kitchen window shattered into hundreds  of pieces. Glass shards flew everywhere but I couldn’t move; the  entire room was suddenly engulfed in a bright pink light. Obaa chan,  is she okay?</p>
<p>What’s going on? No, it couldn’t be!</p>
<p>A  small baseball sized object zipped by my head. I automatically  followed its motion, its every movement seemed to have slowed until  the last second it melded into obaa chan’s towel. Everything about  it screamed danger.</p>
<p>“Obaa chan, drop  it!”</p>
<p>“Pure…hearts…”</p>
<p>Reacting by habit I  reached for my back pocket to discover…I don’t have my bracelets!  That’s right! I never thought the enemy would come all the way out  here.</p>
<p>So… I guess it was time for plan B after  all.</p>
<p>“YAHHHHHH!”</p>
<p><u>Haruka’s  POV</u></p>
<p><strong>CRASH!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“YAHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>My eyes  shot open. What the hell was that? It sounded like a window broke.  Immediately I turned towards the sound. The house…</p>
<p>“It’s  on fire! Michi! Wake up!” I shook the sleeping woman.</p>
<p>“Mm…Haruka…?  What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“We got a problem!”</p>
<p>As mine  had, her sleepy aqua eyes blinked several times before instantly  jumping alert.</p>
<p>We both nodded simultaneously.</p>
<p>“Uranus  planet power, make up!”</p>
<p>“Neptune planet power, make  up!”</p>
<p>Kaiya! Obaa chan! My mind raced as I sprinted to the  front entrance and kicked down the door.</p>
<p>“Where are you?  Can anyone hear me?” I shouted. I could barely see anything; there  was smoke everywhere, the tainted air clawed at my eyes and burned my  lungs. If it weren’t for this smoke! I mentally  cursed.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!” A familiar blue blast shot over  my shoulder, parting the fog as it went. The blast deteriorated as it  hit the far-side wall, returning back into normal water. Neptune must  have halved the attack power.</p>
<p>“They must be further ahead.”  I heard Michi point out.</p>
<p>“Looks that way. I’ll go right,  take the left.” She nodded and I was off.</p>
<p>Somehow I  managed to avoid tripping over anything during my frantic search of  the area. Luckily, I also dodged the flame’s fingertips. They were  spreading fast, hungrily devouring anything they could reach.</p>
<p>What  happened to cause this? Why won’t anyone answer me?</p>
<p>“Is  anyone there?” I tried again.</p>
<p><strong>Crash!</strong></p>
<p>My head  spun. That came from the kitchen! I ran forwards two steps in that  direction before a large fire ignited cloth shot out of the open  entrance. Wait, that is a <em>really</em> long piece of cloth. I  watched warily as the object retracted and squirmed as though it were  in pain.</p>
<p>“Gaaaah! You little pest!” Came a monstrous  voice.</p>
<p>Youma!</p>
<p>I threw my entire weight around the  corner at all once only to almost trip over Kaiya and obaa chan.  However, it was mostly due to obaa chan, who was now unconscious. For  a minute I thought the demon had taken her heart crystal but relief  came when I checked the woman’s breathing, which was normal. Their  victim’s are usually thrown into a near death like state.</p>
<p>At  that, the monster narrowed its eyes suspiciously.</p>
<p>“Want to  play? Then get in line!”</p>
<p>Another strand came flying at my  head but it was easily evaded. What’s with these monster’s and  using malleable fabric for weapons? A quick motion suddenly startled  me, Kaiya was on her feet again and had grasped the long white  cloth.</p>
<p>“What are you?”</p>
<p><strong>Riiiip!</strong></p>
<p>“GAH!”  The youma howled. Kaiya had snapped the thread and threw it into a  gathering of hungry flames.</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!” Neptune had  rounded through the other end and released an attack onto the enemy,  knocking it outside through the broken  window.</p>
<p>“Yaaaaaah!”</p>
<p>“Neptune…” I was so glad  to see her.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to get outside.” She coughed.  Despite her efforts the place was becoming worse, it was going to  burn down with us in it if we didn’t get out soon.</p>
<p>I nodded.  “Give me a hand here.”</p>
<p>I made to pick up Kaiya.</p>
<p>“Hey!  What are you doing?” She protested.</p>
<p>“Just trust me on  this.” I slung her body over one shoulder and waited until Neptune  had obaa chan in a secure hold. “Let’s go!”</p>
<p>We were  lucky, half the house collapsed as we jumped out. However that was  the least of my concerns. Where the hell was that bloody youma? My  head swung right and left but it seemed to have disappeared. Did  Neptune knock it far away? Or was it merely binding its time?</p>
<p>“Look  out!” Kaiya shouted. Behind!</p>
<p>As I turned a curtain of white  had blinded my vision. That sure answered my question! In doing so, I  dropped Kaiya. The blonde made a small squeak of surprise as she hit  the soft sand.</p>
<p>“Uranus!”</p>
<p>“Neptune, get out of  here!” I tried to voice my concerns but they were muffled in the  fabric. It had the majority of my face covered. Trying to choke me  huh? Both of my eyes automatically shut tight, transferring my  strength to my arms. I had this one thought  out.</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p>The impact resulted with a  flurry of white overtaking the blood red sky. Did I do it?</p>
<p>“Stay  on guard, look at the thread!” Neptune cried out.</p>
<p>What is  it now? To my horror the tuff of battered cloth separated into their  individual threads and reattached themselves as though the attack  never happened. Was that why Kaiya was burning it? I looked to my  counter part who bit her bottom lip, watching nervously. That was  when something in me snapped.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Get  going!”</p>
<p>“Where to…? We’re surrounded.”</p>
<p>A  white dome of thread finished its completion around the small area.  Was that its original intention? There was no way out and the ocean  was at our backs. Swimming was an option but I doubt we’d have  enough time to get around the thing without being shot at! Memories  of the last fight started to resurface. It was just like last time,  like that barrier of water.</p>
<p>I’ll show you! “Raaaagh!”  There was one idea that I had… It might work! As I dashed forward  everything moved in slow motion. Every step, my every breath, the  ground becoming further distant from my feet…Until that last moment  mid air when I released the world shaking. Here  goes!</p>
<p>“World…SHAKING!” I started the attack, slamming it  into my opposite arm. “AH!”</p>
<p>To unleash the world shaking  a sacrificial surface is required to finalize the energy composition.  It doesn’t matter what, it just had to be something. Normally the  ground was best but it would slow down the attack’s momentum. This  way…</p>
<p>“AhHhHh!” I watched the monster receive the blast  head on, grinding it into the gritty sand pebbles. Too much friction  and what do you get?</p>
<p>“Fire!” I heard Kaiya yell. The  beast ignited. It twitched and squirmed, continually screaming for  its pathetic life. With satisfaction I watched it continue to do so  until the last of it had burned into a fine powder of ashes.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”  I felt my legs tremble and so I fell to one knee. My arm was pretty  battered up…Then again battered up may be an understatement, I  chuckled. If it weren’t my own power my arm would’ve been ripped  off.</p>
<p>“The dome…It’s not disappearing.”</p>
<p>“Correct!”</p>
<p>I  had barely turned my head when I saw a woman in red send Neptune  flying with a high kick.</p>
<p><strong>WHAP!  Shhhhhhhhhhhhh….</strong></p>
<p>“Neptune!” How did she do that?  She’s not even on the ground, she’s floating!</p>
<p>“There’s  more than one way to steal a pure heart.” The stranger mocked. “You  use a decoy and…” She held obaa chan by her shirt collar shirt  and smiled. With her other hand she curled it into a fist before  stretching it suddenly into an open palm, her nails becoming swords  themselves.</p>
<p>“No, don’t!” I yelled, catching onto her  plan.</p>
<p><strong>FOOOOOOSH!</strong></p>
<p>“Obaa chan!” Kaiya  screamed.</p>
<p>A white light lit the area briefly but I heard a  thud before I saw clearly again.</p>
<p>“Obaa chan, obaa chan!”  Kaiya had run over and was frantically shaking obaa chan’s limp  body.</p>
<p>“You!” I cried, glaring up at the woman.</p>
<p>“If <em>you</em> have any manners you’d call someone by their name. I am  Kaolinite of the Death Busters.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what your  name is!” I was tempted to say more but held my breath when the  enemy started to inspect the crystal. If she does anythingn to that  I’ll…</p>
<p>“Pity, another worthless piece of  junk.”</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!” Neptune had  recovered.</p>
<p>Kaolinite dodged to the right wildly, barely  escaping the deadly encounter. Again the woman laughed.</p>
<p>“Want  this back? Foolish sailor senshi, even if you return this crystal to  that old woman she’ll still die.”</p>
<p>No…It can’t  be!</p>
<p>“Urusai!” I won’t believe it!</p>
<p>“Heh…Think  you can do something about it? Dream on. Just face it, her body is  finished. Growing old is death itself.”</p>
<p>“What are you  talking about? You’re a hag yourself!” It was neither Neptune or  myself who had declared this, leaving me to think… then that  means…</p>
<p>Kaiya, what are you doing? I suddenly panicked.  Kaolinite shot the blonde a disgusted look, curling her bottom lip  tightly.</p>
<p>“See? You’re getting wrinkles!”</p>
<p>“Geh…”  Kaolinite twitched her eyebrows. “Enough of this!”</p>
<p>One of  her sword-like nails extended once more, shooting towards the teen  with a killer intent.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” My feet were already  moving but it wasn’t enough. Too fast, I won’t make it in time.  It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>SLISH!</strong></p>
<p>I stopped dead in my  tracks, trying to take in what just happened. There was a spray of  blood but to my relief, she was still standing. At the last minute it  looks like the blonde had shifted her weight to one side, adjusting  the enemy’s target to only her shoulder area. But that still  doesn’t mean she’s all right!</p>
<p>“Ha…ha…I hate you.”  She gasped, glaring up at Kaolinite. “Whoever you  are…”</p>
<p>Kaolinite’s eyes flickered momentarily before a  look of utmost hatred flared up. “You…” I barely heard the  whisper, what was she saying?</p>
<p>“You’re not getting this  back.” Kaiya pulled the instrument deeper. Then I saw what she  meant, the nail was buried into the ground directly behind her,  securing them both to their positions.</p>
<p>“That’s why I have  two hands fool!”</p>
<p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!” Neptune intercepted  the next attack and automatically created the diversion.</p>
<p>“My  nail!” Kaolinite cried out when the red weapon shattered.</p>
<p>“Worry  about this!” I had leaped off of the initial nail, still connected  to Kaiya to where she floated, my world shaking already starting to  form.</p>
<p>“No…” She mumbled. “It wasn’t supposed to be  like this!”</p>
<p>“<strong>World…SHAKING!</strong>”</p>
<p>I threw it  as hard as I could, slamming it into her face first. Her scream  filled the area but shortly disappeared along with the artificial  thread dome. It was more than she deserved.</p>
<p><strong>Tup.</strong></p>
<p>As  soon as I landed Neptune ran up by my side. “Uranus, are you all  right…?” But she wasn’t talking about my injured arm…</p>
<p>“Obaa  chan…Kaiya…”</p>
<p>“Kaiya is…” She turned to see the  teen trying to hold by tears as she guarded the elder woman’s body.  “I-I hate to admit it but, what she said may be  true.”</p>
<p>“Neptune…”</p>
<p>“However, if we return the  crystal, she might be alive for a little longer.”</p>
<p>Returning  the crystal was one of the hardest things I ever had to do aside from  watching Kaiya. The kid was a wreck and her shoulder…didn’t look  too good. I wanted to get her some help but it wouldn’t be right to  take her away before she could say her goodbye.</p>
<p>Everyone  seemed to hold their breath as the crystal reabsorbed itself into  obaa chan’s body. At the initial contact she gasped for air, before  slowing and coughing every so often. How long did we have?</p>
<p>“Obaa  chan!” Kaiya cried again. “You’re going to be okay right?”  Tears started to form again when the elderly woman smiled.</p>
<p>“You’re  hurt.” The senior suddenly noticed Kaiya’s injury. “You should  go get that looked at immediately.”</p>
<p>“B-but…”</p>
<p>“You  also need to bring Haruka, I would like to see her too.”</p>
<p>I  wanted to say ‘I’m right here’ but I didn’t. It was so  painful; my heart felt like someone was twisting it and tying it into  tiny knots. By the time Kaiya gets back, obaa chan will likely  be…</p>
<p>“Although I’ve only known you for a day obaa chan,  you’re the best grandma there is.” She hugged the elder woman,  who didn’t seem to mind the bloodstains her clothes acquired from  the teen’s wound. “Haruka is really lucky to have someone like  you.”</p>
<p>“Remember our promise…” Obaa chan smiled  wearily. Her strength was already starting to fade on her. With that  I motioned Neptune to take Kaiya with a nod of my head.</p>
<p>“Come  on, let’s find this Haruka person.” Neptune coaxed the teen to  let go of the dying senior.</p>
<p>“See you later  Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“Yeah…Bye obaa chan.”</p>
<p>I waited until  the two had made their way halfway down the strip before turning back  to the senior. How can I break this to her easily? How would she  react once she knows?</p>
<p>“It makes me sad that I won’t be  able to see her again. She’s such a sweet heart…You’re lucky to  have that girl for a friend Haruka.”</p>
<p>“… You knew?” I  made my way over to her, bending down to sit next to her battered  form.</p>
<p>“Nothing…gets by your obaa chan.” She coughed. “I  don’t have much time left…”</p>
<p>“I-“</p>
<p>“Shh, just  listen for a minute. I know things have been hard for you.  Whatever…job you have to do…do your best.” I nodded my head.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Kaiya and Michiru…p-protect them,  keep them close. They care for you…very much.”</p>
<p>Desperately  I wanted to say ‘save your strength’ but it wouldn’t do her any  good. Nothing would at this point. I can’t believe its come to  this, right now. It shouldn’t have been like this! First mom and  now obaa chan, why are the people most precious to me are being taken  away? Is this punishment for being so weak? Does a higher power enjoy  toying with my life?</p>
<p>“And…I know I’ve…never…said  this but…I’m very proud of you. Proud, Haruk…a. I…you’re  my…most treasured…daughter.”</p>
<p>I wasn’t some adoptive  kid or even a granddaughter to her…but a daughter. That itself  meant the world to me. It meant that I have a home in someone’s  heart…for a little while longer at least.</p>
<p>It’s…not  fair.</p>
<p>“Obaa chan, I don’t deserve it… I’m sorry! I’m  sorry for not being strong enough, for falling for the decoy! I was  so stupid! If I had gotten to you sooner this wouldn’t have  happened!”</p>
<p>“Haru…ka…”</p>
<p>“I promise I’ll  protect Michiru and Kaiya! I’ll do my best at everything. I won’t  lose! I’ll-”<br />
  “Ru…ka…” I could barely hear her now, so  I bent down and listened closely. “Good…luck…tomor…row…</p>
<p>“Obaa  chan? Obaa chan!” My body trembled under the heavy weight. “<strong>OBAA  CHAN</strong>!” I screamed at the top of my lungs.  “<strong>AHHHHHH</strong>!”</p>
<p><u>Next afternoon,  racetrack</u></p>
<p>“Racers start your engines…GO!”</p>
<p>Did  you see the large crowd at your funeral today obaa chan? Practically  the entire town showed up. Everyone cried for you…Kaiya, Baluk san,  Michiru…including me. Yes, even I cried after all these years  because…you were a special person to me as well. Did you hear that?  I hope you did. I also hope you’re happy where you are now, I hope  you’re with mom, together in a place with no more pain but eternal  paradise.</p>
<p>…I miss you both very much…Sometimes when I  close my eyes I can see you both smiling at me, as if you were really  here by my side. Maybe you are. Hey, can you see me? Are you watching  me right now? If you are, better watch close!</p>
<p>“Tenoh is on  the final stretch, taking the lead!”</p>
<p>Arigato and…</p>
<p>“Tenoh  takes first place! Look at the crowd going  wild!”</p>
<p>Sayonara.</p>
