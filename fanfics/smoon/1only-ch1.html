<h1>My One, My Only, My Eternity (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The deep fog of dawn settled over the quiet gardens of the majestic 
moon palace, shadowing the sparkling morning dew of the silver roses 
and white pond lilies that seemed most abundant in the moon&#146;s 
beautiful gardens. The only sound as the bright sphere that was earth 
rose to cast it&#146;s light on the moon was the clicking of tiny heels on 
the marble walkways as the young moon heiress, Princess Serenity, ran 
carelessly through them, unaware of the eyes watching her.

&#147;Galaxia! Where are you!&#148; the eight year old cried, letting out a 
small yelp as she tripped over her own dress before landing in a heap 
on the hard white marble. She sat up, stifling the urge to cry her 
lunges out, knowing it would alert her guardian cat, Luna, before 
turning as the sound of heels clicked on the path behind her. Azure 
eyes lit up as the taller figure of a woman wearing golden armor 
appeared in the mist, followed closely by two others, though the 
others obviously younger. The woman smiled down at the silver child of 
the moon, sliding down to one knee, her massive sword clanking loudly 
on the ground in the silent garden as she took Serenity into her arms.

&#147;Galaxia&#133;I don&#146;t want you to go&#133;&#148; the princess whispered, tears 
welling in her eyes as she looked behind the woman hugging her, to 
where another woman had appeared to take the hands of the other girls. 
Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune looked up adoringly at the green 
haired guardian of the time gates before looking back at their 
princess.

&#147;Galaxia&#133;you must go now&#133;&#148; Pluto murmured tonelessly, watching with 
cold, unfeeling eyes as the golden warrior of the galaxy embraced 
Serenity tighter before holding her at arms length.

&#147;I will miss you, my darling Serenity&#133;I will see you again&#133;when you 
are ready to know me once more&#133;&#148; the woman with golden-red hair 
murmured softly, finally letting go of the young girl she&#146;d come to 
love. Galaxia turned on her heel, walking with Pluto in the mists as 
Uranus and Neptune were left to comfort the crying child of the moon.

&#147;You will not be aloud to see her again. You&#146;ve become too arrogant 
Galaxia. If you will not obey the Queen Serenity, you will be exiled. 
It is my queen&#146;s wish that I ask you one last time&#133;&#148; Pluto murmured as 
they appeared before the time gates, the massive doors yawning open, 
&#147;will you submit to the will of Queen Serenity?&#148;

Galaxia rested cold maroon eyes on the guardian, staring into the 
other woman&#146;s eyes until Pluto was forced to look away. Galaxia 
smiled, running a hand down the other woman&#146;s face.

&#147;No, Pluto, I will not. I will see you one day as well&#133;when I come to 
see my Serenity.&#148; the golden warrior whispered quietly before turning 
to walk silently through the gates of time, where she was delivered to 
the other end of the universe.

The fog slowly faded with the gates of time, leaving one solitary 
figure to watch with narrowed red eyes&#133;
