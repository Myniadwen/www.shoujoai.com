<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 7 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Laurena and Tai had come back from their 10 minute break. What they 
found shocked them considerably. Their usually strong, calm, happy, 
and energetic Princess/friend was in a heap on the floor. Crying like 
there was no tomorrow. They quickly went to her and helped her to the 
couch. She told them why the Fire Queen had come. 12 minutes after 
crying on Tai&#146;s shoulder she calmed and a fire grew in her eyes. 
Scaring poor Laurena when she shot up and headed out the room. Calling 
behind her &#147; Take next week off.&#148; Tai and Laurena just stared after 
her, knowing someone was in danger of her wrath. 

- I want know, and I&#146;m gonna know now!- 

Terrestria stepped into the pure white Portal room. Stepping angrily 
down the Palace hallways, searching for her brother or his adviser. 
She found Rikkon, the King&#146;s advisor. He smiled at her, until he saw 
how angry she was.

&#147; Rikkon, where the hell is my brother?&#148;

&#147; With Neo-Queen Serenity, it&#146;s their daily alone time. I&#146;m afraid you 
can&#146;t see him.&#148;

&#147; Rikkon do I look like I care?&#148;

&#147; * gulp * &#133;&#133;no.&#148; Yeah&#133;he was scared now.

&#147; Where ,Rikkon?&#148; He looked at the looming, very angry, very scary 
Planet Queen. 

&#147; West wing, Relax room.&#148; He relaxed as she smiled slightly. Though 
before he blinked she teleported away. - uh oh-

~~~~****~~~~****~~~~****~~~~****~~~~****~~~~****

Endymion and Serenity were cuddled on the couch talking. Very peaceful 
and calm until they heard shouting voices outside the door. Then the 
guards pulling their swords out. The couple turned to watch the door. 
Hearing the muffled cries of pain from the guards. Two thuds against a 
wall and metal snapping, clanking against the marble floor. The door 
itself went flying of it&#146;s hinges. Revealing the guards slumped 
against the wall, swords in 2 pieces, &#133;&#133;and a very angry Planet Queen. 

&#147; Terri? Why are you here?&#148; Endymion looked at his sister. She glared 
back. 

&#147; Don&#146;t you &#145;Terri&#146; me Endymion&#133;(gently) Hello Serena.&#148; Her anger 
coming back as she turned back to her brother.

&#147; What the hell did you do to Rei?&#148; Realization struck as he figured 
out why she was here.

&#147; I told her to stop seeing you. It&#146;s for the best Terri. That 
relationship would cause your ruin.&#148; He looked calmly at her.

&#147; WHAT?!?!&#148; Serena &amp; Terrestria yelled in unison. Serena quickly got 
up, slapped her husband hard, and stood next to her sister-in-law 
(SIL).

&#147; Terri may I stay in Black Diamond Castle until my husband comes back 
from god knows where?&#148; Terrestria nods and leaves to prepare her 
suite. But not before slapping her brother&#146;s other cheek.

&#147; Darien Shields that is the stupidest thing you have ever done. What 
kind of shit is that? Rei causing Terri&#146;s downfall&#133;bull. If your 
worried about an heir, there are ways you ass!&#148; Then Serena teleported 
to pack her things and left with out another word.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~***

Slender hands pulled open the large black doors. Five figures slipped 
in and shut the doors. Walking through another hallway and across the 
living room, they went through a periwinkle door. There they crept to 
the massive four poster bed, pulling back the curtains.

&#147; Terri?&#148;

&#147; Kitten, I think that Dragon is sleeping peacefully this time.&#148; Amara 
looked at the outer princess ( yes I know she&#146;s a queen, but that 
seems to fit with Amara.) Eyelids fluttered opened, two silver-navy 
blue orbs staring back. Sitting up she rubbed her neck. Crawling onto 
the bed, Hotaru went to the older woman. 

&#147; Now, see what ya did? You woke her up!&#148; Terri smiled and turned on 
the lights as the others climbed on the bed. Michelle looked at her 
friend. 

&#147; Terri you&#146;ve been in bed for 3 days!&#148;

&#147; Yeah your Kingdom is worried Dragon!&#148;

&#147; You don&#146;t smile much anymore.&#148;

&#147; Or laugh!&#148;

&#147; At least come to the living room, Lita sent some of your favorites!&#148; 
Terri smiled as her friends/SIL bombed her with their worries about 
her.

&#147; Alright let me change k?&#148; They nodded and left. A few minutes later 
she came out in a curve fitting periwinkle gown, sleeves split and 
hanging, showing her shoulders. Hair in her royal style. Terri sat 
next to Hotaru, the closet thing she had to a sister. Besides Serena, 
who was by marriage. 

&#147; Dragon&#133;who&#146;s watching over the Kingdom?&#148; Terri looked up, for the 
first time in 3 days, with her happy eyes. 

&#147; Taref is ruling again until I get&#133;stable.&#148; 

&#147; That&#146;s what Luna is doing until I return. I couldn&#146;t let my husband 
rule alone. He&#146;d screw it up.&#148; They laughed and Terri finally got up 
the courage to ask: &#147; How&#146;s my Fir-&#133;I mean Rei?&#148; The only one not 
scowling was Setsuna, who spoke.

&#147; She&#146;s&#133;fine.&#148; Terri smiled.

&#147; Liar, tell me the truth.&#148; Setsuna sighed

&#147; She&#146;s worse than you. The only ones who will talk to her are me, 
Lita, Mina, and Ami. &#147; Terri gave her a confused look, which was rare.

&#147; Why only you guys?&#148;

&#147; Even though you know the reason she broke up with you, she won&#146;t fix 
it. She says Darien&#146;s right, that there&#146;s someone better for you. But 
she looks horrible, her eyes are all red from crying and her eyes 
don&#146;t shine like they did. It&#146;s really bad.&#148; The Plutonian looked at 
her lap. Terri just sighed and imagined what her Firebird was going 
through.

&#147; I see&#133;, and if she doesn&#146;t want to be my girlfriend again, the I 
don&#146;t wanna be hers. Now&#133;I need to exercise. Anyone wanna train?&#148; they 
all smiled as she snapped her fingers and stood up. Now in her 
training gi. The five did the same and raced to the MA room. (Martial 
Arts)

** A week later**

The eleven royals, Taref, Luna, and Artemis were in their monthly 
meeting. Right now they were split into two groups. The first one 
Terrestria, Luna, Amara, Michelle, Hotaru, Taref, and Serenity. Second 
Endymion, Lita, Ami, Mina, Artemis, Setsuna, and Rei. Rei shifted 
through some contracts and documents.

1&#148; Pluto where are those Venusian Drilling contracts? I wanna look 
them over.&#148; Pluto didn&#146;t look up from the map of Jupiter she was 
working on.

&#147; Saturn&#146;s got them, she was checking the suggested landmarks for 
fault lines I think.&#148; Mars nodded and got up. Saturn was with the 
Outers and Moon by the hung up geography maps. They obviously saw her 
coming cause they moved in a semi circle around Terrestrial, and 
glared. Mars smiled nervously and walked closer.

&#147; Ummm&#133; Saturn, I need the Venusian Drilling Contracts.&#148; The young 
Queen plucked them off a table.

&#147; Here you are Mars, we just finished. Oh and tell Mercury that we 
didn&#146;t find anything.&#148; Mars nodded and hurried back to the cluttered 
table. 

&#147; Mercury they didn&#146;t find anything.&#148; The genius nodded and scribbled 
it into her notes. 

They were almost done when the alarm went off and a screen popped up. 
Showing eleven very big and nasty youma.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

A/N: Okay 1. In meetings they call themselves by their planets k? k.

And yes I know I keep switching between Terri and Terrestria. Sorry 
but in some situations one name is better than the other to use. 
That&#146;s gonna happen with Terri/Terrestria, Serena/Serenity, and 
Darien/Endymion. Gives me more words to use. So now I get to the new 
enemy. Bye!</pre>
