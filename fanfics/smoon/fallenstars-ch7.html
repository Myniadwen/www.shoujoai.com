<a href="../smoon/fallenstars-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The Epilogue Arrives! 
The Return to Whence They Came.
    
    
    Minako wasn&#39;t known for being an early riser, but there were some 
things that could stop even her from sleeping in. Her imminent return 
to her home world from some warped fantasy one, for example. That is 
just the kind of event that will make anyone as excited as a child 
waiting for their trip to an amusement park.
    
    Of course that left her with very little to do besides sit and 
twiddle her thumbs, but thankfully for her, her friends were in 
exactly the same boat. Well, Ami almost always rose early anyway, but 
that was Ami for you.
    
    And, in typical Minako fashion, what else would she be doing but 
snooping out gossip? True, she had matured a great deal since her 
days of teaming up with Usagi to stalk their friends, but some things 
would never change. This time her definition of snooping just boiled 
down to a girl to girl chat in the back of their caravan as Rei 
packed and re-packed her belongings, making sure she had everything 
that she wanted to take back home. In all honesty Rei was happy to 
have the company. It had been a long time since she and Minako had 
just chatted.
    
    &quot;So come on Rei-chan,&quot; Minako wheedled, a cheeky but strangely 
innocent smile on her face. &quot;Spill the milk already. What&#39;s it like?&quot;
    
    Rei just shook her head, though she didn&#39;t mind a bit. &quot;What&#39;s 
what like?&quot; she asked in reply, feigning ignorance.
    
    &quot;You know what what,&quot; Minako pouted. &quot;The Mako-chan what. What&#39;s 
it like? What&#39;s *she* like? Is she really as spaced out as she looked 
when she was following all her sempai look-alikes?&quot;
    
    The mention of Makoto&#39;s old upperclassman made Rei frown, but she 
forced herself to let that go quickly. &quot;She&#39;s not spaced out. She&#39;s a 
hopeless romantic.&quot; Rei paused and shook her head. &quot;No, make that a 
hopeful romantic. I think the starry eyed thing is her looking for an 
opening to be romantic when someone is ignoring her.&quot;
    
    &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll be baking you cookies and stuff?&quot; Minako 
asked. It was a pretty classic show of affection back in school after 
all.
    
    Rei chuckled at that. &quot;Knowing her, probably. I wouldn&#39;t mind a 
bit. Makoto-chan is a great cook.&quot;
    
    &quot;Makoto-chan huh? Or just &#39;Makoto&#39; even. You really do like her, 
don&#39;t you?&quot;
    
    Rei nodded. &quot;Yes. If I didn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have let it go this 
far.&quot;
    
    &quot;This far?&quot; Minako asked, her eyebrows rising and her grin 
growing larger. &quot;Just how far have you gone.&quot;
    
    Rei just gave her friend a withering look. &quot;Far enough to know 
how I feel, and that&#39;s all you&#39;re going to get.&quot;
    
    Minako just leaned back against the caravan wall and smiled. &quot;So, 
is it like you thought it would be?&quot;
    
    Rei paused. &quot;No. Not really.&quot;
    
    &quot;Oh?&quot; Minako asked, caught by surprise. &quot;Why not?&quot;
    
    Rei had thought about that a lot recently. &quot;What&#39;s changed? I 
mean really changed. We&#39;ve always had fun together, all of us, even 
though we all go to different colleges and universities. And if we 
could spend more time with each other, what would happen? I found 
out. Makoto-chan is still one of my best friends, she&#39;s just more 
than that as well. Nothing has changed, except that we&#39;re both happy 
to be closer to each other than friends are supposed to be.&quot;
    
    The look Minako gave her was slightly incredulous. &quot;You can&#39;t be 
serious.&quot;
    
    &quot;Really, I am,&quot; Rei replied in earnest. &quot;I love her, but it&#39;s not 
a crush and I haven&#39;t fallen head over heels or anything. She&#39;s the 
one who had the epiphany.  That just gave me the chance to realise 
that I like being closer to her.&quot;
    
    She paused. &quot;You know, I actually thought she would lose interest 
in me pretty quickly,&quot; Rei confessed. &quot;What with all her &#39;sempai&#39; 
turns and everything. But she was gentler and more sensitive than I 
thought she would be, and she still made me feel protected too. It 
scared me a little when I realised I really did like her as well. She 
makes me feel a little like Haruka-san does when she&#39;s got that charm 
dial of hers turned way up, or those pretty boys in my manga books, 
but without the predatory edge they have. It&#39;s just warm and 
comforting.&quot;
    
    Minako&#39;s smile had slowly grown as Rei had talked. &quot;You&#39;re dead 
wrong, Rei-chan. You&#39;re definitely head over heels.&quot;
    
    Rei smiled with a touch of embarrassment. &quot;No I&#39;m not. I just 
like her, and she likes me. It&#39;s nice.&quot;
    
    Minako just nodded, smiling ear to ear. &quot;I bet.&quot;
    
***
    
    Rei wasn&#39;t the only one thinking about relationships that 
morning. Haruka had wandered out beyond the vast camp, enjoying the 
sunshine and trying to be patient over seeing Michiru again. It was 
tantalising, know how close she was to seeing her partner again, and 
still being an entire world away.
    
    The smell of her damp hair, the melodic singing of her violin, 
there wasn&#39;t much that Haruka couldn&#39;t feel of Michiru now, all 
etched into her memory. The second she got back she would lock them 
both in their bedroom for as long as she could get away with, and 
experience her all over again.   
    
    Haruka had thought there would be nothing that could ever make 
her forget every little thing that made up Michiru in her mind, but 
scarily that had turned out not to be true. It had only been two 
months or so, but little things had begun to seep away. She couldn&#39;t 
quite picture that knowing smirk Michiru wore when she played 
turnabout and flirted with a man right in front of her. She couldn&#39;t 
remember the words to the song she use to sing to Hotaru when the 
girl was still so small, even though Haruka had always listened in, 
in secret.
    
    They were just little things, but they were enough to plant the 
seeds of worry inside her. Had it also been two months in Tokyo? What 
had Michiru done in that time? Was she still frantically looking for 
her, even though there must have been nothing they could have done? 
Did she still wait at night for her to magically re-appear? Had she 
and Hotaru moved on in their lives, knowing nothing could be done?
    
    ... Had Michiru been unfaithful too?
    
    The worst part of that was that Haruka didn&#39;t even feel guilty, 
but she knew how hurt she would feel if Michiru had found someone 
else. Angry even. She just sighed and looked up to the cloud strewn 
skies. She would live with whatever had happened, and she would just 
have to hope that Michiru would do the same. They knew each other far 
too well to be idealistic about such things. 
    
    &quot;Haruka?&quot;
    
    The tall, boyish blonde looked around to see Ami standing there, 
once again wearing her school uniform. It was only natural that she 
was the only one actually wearing anything suitable to return home 
in. However, what struck Haruka was hearing her name spoken so 
intimately from Ami. She was more used to it now, being the way 
everyone spoke in this world, but still...
    
    Ami surprised her again when she stepped close and wrapped her 
arms around Haruka&#39;s waist in a gentle, friendly hug.
    
    &quot;Ami-chan,&quot; Haruka said, taken aback. &quot;What is it? What&#39;s wrong.&quot;
    
    Ami just smiled into Haruka&#39;s robe. &quot;Nothing. I&#39;ve just been very 
silly.&quot; She broke away and looked happily into Haruka&#39;s eyes. &quot;Thank 
you for looking out for me, Haruka. I&#39;m sorry I have avoided you over 
the last few days. That isn&#39;t the way a friend is supposed to 
behave.&quot;
    
    Haruka finally returned the smile as she realised what Ami had 
meant. They had been avoiding each other, ever since that awkward 
goodnight at the Warlock&#39;s tower. Ami had seemed withdrawn since 
then. Haruka had made more than one attempt to involve her in what 
was going on, but with little success. At the time Haruka couldn&#39;t 
blame her. Their feelings were still confused when it came to each 
other, she knew, but she had tried not to let that get in the way of 
everything else. 
    
    Now Ami was doing the same. She hadn&#39;t wanted to get closer to 
Haruka, and in so doing she had ended up avoiding her. Simply hearing 
Haruka&#39;s concern for her over her shooting of that soldier in the 
battle at the manor had broken through the defences she had put up. 
But Ami could live with that. It wouldn&#39;t be the first crush she had 
ever had that could come to nothing.
    
    &quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve been making you uncomfortable,&quot; Haruka said, but 
Ami hushed her.
    
    &quot;It&#39;s too late for that,&quot; she replied. &quot;Nothing you have done 
will make us think less of you, myself included. I&#39;m just glad you 
aren&#39;t worrying around us any more.&quot;
    
    She leaned up, cupping Haruka&#39;s jaw in her palm as she placed a 
light kiss on the taller girl&#39;s lips. A kiss that lingered as Haruka 
replied in kind.
    
    Ami was blushing as they parted, but the smile she wore lit up 
her face. &quot;We can still be friends, like we are supposed to be. As 
long as you are happy, I don&#39;t mind.&quot; Her eyes fell. &quot;We can enjoy it 
for what it was, right?&quot;
    
    Haruka nodded. &quot;Of course.&quot;
    
    Ami&#39;s smile returned, even though her eyes were moist. &quot;I know I 
can&#39;t win against Michiru-san, but I don&#39;t want to. I won&#39;t tell her, 
and I&#39;ll make sure the others don&#39;t either. Just remember to say 
hello every now and again, okay? We miss seeing you all when you 
disappear for so long.&quot; 
    
    &quot;I&#39;ll try,&quot; Haruka replied. &quot;I know we haven&#39;t always seen eye to 
eye, but we missed you too. We were just ashamed. Especially me.&quot;
    
    Ami nodded. &quot;And that was silly of you. So now we&#39;ve both been 
silly we are even.&quot; She was about to turn back, but she paused.
    
    &quot;Thank you, Haruka-san. For everything.&quot;
    
    Haruka smiled in reply. &quot;You&#39;re not the only one who gets to say 
that, Ami-chan. Thank you.&quot;
    
    The pair stood there for a moment, both wearing their faint 
smiles, before they went their separate ways. They both still had 
things to pack and people to say goodbye to after all.

***
    
    &quot;Are you sure you are ready, Makoto dear?&quot; Juriere asked as they 
kneaded their dough together inside the family&#39;s caravan. 
    
    Makoto giggled a little and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot; It was 
the fifth time she had asked since daybreak, and each time she 
sounded like just as much of a worrisome parent as the last. It was 
something Makoto had come to like about the woman - the fact that she 
was treated as a member of the family and not just as a guest.
    
    &quot;Leave her alone Mother,&quot; Jiyu said from the bunk on the forward 
wall of the mobile home. &quot;She&#39;s going to be gone in less than an 
hour. You could be grateful that she wants to spend that time with 
you.&quot;
    
    &quot;&#39;With us&#39;,&quot; Maki corrected from the other end of the bunk. 
    
    Juriere looked down into her bowl. &quot;I am. I will miss having a 
girl around after this, but surely there are other things you could 
be doing Makoto, not just baking with a worrisome old woman.&quot;
    
    Makoto laughed at that. &quot;Old? That&#39;s one thing you&#39;re not 
Juriere. Anyway, what should I do? I&#39;ve got everything I want to 
take. I&#39;d rather be with my family, especially after all this trouble 
we&#39;ve caused.&quot;
    
    &quot;I don&#39;t know if you caused it, but you certainly helped remedy 
it,&quot; Jiyu countered. &quot;And with considerable skill I might add.&quot;
    
    &quot;Thank you,&quot; Makoto beamed. &quot;I hope you all get it to work out. 
Politics is so complicated.&quot;
    
    Jiyu just shrugged. &quot;That is for the old guys to sort out. We&#39;ve 
done our part, at least for now.&quot;
    
    &quot;Exactly,&quot; Juriere agreed, &quot;and you all came out of it safely. 
That is more than enough for me. What will you be doing when you do 
get back dear?&quot;
    
    Makoto found that she actually had to think about that. What was 
she doing back home? &quot;I still have to finish my studies, I guess,&quot; 
she replied eventually. &quot;I&#39;ll have to find myself a job, see all my 
friends again. And be a warrior for love and justice on the side!&quot;
    
    &quot;Wow,&quot; Maki said to himself as he imagined his &#39;older sister&#39; as 
an angelic swordswoman, riding through the world of the gods. &quot;Do you 
wear shiny armour?&quot;
    
    Makoto chuckled, picturing the undersized sailor outfit that 
passed for her armour when she was Sailor Jupiter. &quot;Ahhh, not 
exactly. It stands out though, that&#39;s for sure.&quot;
    
    &quot;Can I come and visit?&quot; the young boy asked optimistically.
    
    &quot;I don&#39;t think it works like that,&quot; Makoto replied, &quot;but don&#39;t 
forget me, or else I&#39;ll have to come back and punish you!&quot;
    
    Maki just grinned in response. &quot;I won&#39;t, nuh-uh!&quot;
    
    It was only a few minutes later when Rin came in with the news. 
&quot;Makoto, they are ready now. Rei says you should get your things.&quot;
    
    Makoto let out a sigh as the silence hung from the sentence, 
rinsing her hands in the water bowl. &quot;Okay. I guess it&#39;s time to go.&quot;
    
    She and Jiyu&#39;s family filed out and into the large open circle, 
ringed with the thousands of people who had stayed the night with 
them. There in the grassy opening she took her place with the other 
Senshi as they all looked on. In the centre of that clearing stood 
Haruka, Desir, Kaori and every one of the Warlocks that had travelled 
with them.
    
    All eyes were focused on Haruka as Master Daltass held her hands, 
feeling for the faint trace of otherworldliness he had sensed in her 
before. Kaori stood beside them, her consciousness reaching out 
around them as she searched for that thread. The other Warlocks 
waited for her signal, the tension growing palpably among the 
assembled throng. When that signal came the Warlocks completed their 
semi-circular chain and began pouring their own minds into Haruka&#39;s 
ethereal thread. Desir was not about to touch any of them, but with 
such a mass of magical energy focused on the tendril that linked 
Haruka and her home world, all she had to do was reach out and touch 
it. 
    
    The summoning power within her shot along the thread like a flame 
along spilt gasoline, and the Warlocks broke apart, leaving Haruka 
gasping in the centre of the clearing as a murky, purple black sheet 
of liquid reality floating upright above the ground, ringed with fire 
and shimmering like oil on water. The crowd withdrew, but the flowing 
portal grew no wider than ten feet and soon settled to hang just 
above the grass by Desir&#39;s outstretched hand.
    
    &quot;There it is,&quot; Master Daltass said, helping Haruka to her feet. 
&quot;Well done my young woman. That must have felt interesting to say the 
least.&quot;
    
    &quot;No kidding,&quot; Haruka replied. &quot;And do you really need to be 
exploring any more?&quot; She took her hand from his.
    
    Master Daltass just smiled. &quot;Ah, my apologies, but you know how I 
like to take care of my apprentices.&quot;
    
    Haruka just shook her head. It was a bit late for last minute 
communing, but she knew what he was like.
    
    Over with the others Makoto said her goodbyes, giving her nomadic 
surrogate family hugs in turn. &quot;Thank you for everything you have 
done for us,&quot; she said, and she turned to Rin. &quot;Look after them all 
for me.&quot;
    
    Rin nodded and accepted the hug. &quot;I will.&quot;
    
    &quot;You too Jiyu,&quot; Makoto added as she gave the eldest his hug. Jiyu 
didn&#39;t reply, but just smiled.
    
    &quot;I don&#39;t get a goodbye hug?&quot; Tachi asked from the side, but 
Makoto wasn&#39;t about to forget him either.
    
    &quot;And you girls please take care of Makoto for us,&quot; Juriere said 
to the others as Makoto finished her farewells, feeling herself tear 
up as she did.
    
    Rei nodded. &quot;We will. Don&#39;t worry Mrs. Juriere.&quot;
    
    &quot;By the way,&quot; Ami asked Rin, &quot;isn&#39;t Kimiko here?&quot;
    
    Rin just shook his head.
    
    &quot;Why?&quot;
    
    The boy looked down at the ground. &quot;She said not to tell.&quot;
    
    Ami nodded with a sad smile. Maybe the girl just didn&#39;t like 
goodbyes. &quot;Then please tell her that we wish her good luck.&quot;
    
    Rin nodded. &quot;I will.&quot; 
    
    With that the girls took up their bags and turned towards the 
shimmering circle that would take them home. &quot;You know,&quot; Haruka said 
under her breath, &quot;there&#39;s no guarantee this will take us back to 
Tokyo. We&#39;re the guinea pigs in this one.&quot;
    
    The idea wasn&#39;t one they liked. Who knew if it would get them 
anywhere safely? But Minako just shrugged. &quot;Nothing adventured... 
right? It sounds like they&#39;ve worked it out pretty well to me.&quot;
    
    Haruka smiled at the optimistic blonde. &quot;True.&quot; She turned to the 
Warlocks and bowed, receiving a bow from each of them in return. 
    
    &quot;Good luck,&quot; Master Daltass said with a twinkle in his eye.
    
    Standing the other side Desir just smiled at them all. &quot;Well 
kids, that&#39;s all for this world. It&#39;s been fun.&quot;
    
    Rei gave her own personal bane a deadpanned stare. &quot;No, it 
hasn&#39;t. I would say I&#39;d miss you, but I think good riddance is more 
appropriate.&quot;
    
    &quot;Awww,&quot; Desir pouted, &quot;after this you never have to see me again. 
Don&#39;t I even get one kind word, my little Rei?&quot;
    
    Rei scowled, but looked away. &quot;You saved my life, so thanks. But 
that&#39;s all you get.&quot;
    
    If her grin was any indication Desir didn&#39;t seem to mind a bit. 
&quot;That&#39;s better. Have fun girls, and don&#39;t do anything I wouldn&#39;t!&quot;
    
    &quot;Fat chance,&quot; Makoto muttered with a smile. She took Rei&#39;s hand 
and they gave each other a final glance before they both stepped into 
the rippling darkness. 
    
    &quot;&#39;Bye everyone!&quot; Minako waved before she too hopped into the 
portal, finally followed by Ami and Haruka as they stepped through 
together.
    
    A few people cheered, the few who knew them shed a quiet tear, 
but as Desir took her hand away the portal just shrank away without 
so much as a clap of thunder or a puff of smoke.
    
    Once again, the Seraphi had left Seiji just as mysteriously as 
they had appeared.

***
    
    Desir watched with bated breath as Rei and Makoto stepped through 
the portal. 
    
    Then Minako, and Ami, and Haruka. 
    
    She waited as the shimmering purple-black sheet slowly shrank 
until the flaming circle become a pinprick in the air. Then it just 
ceased to exist. And nothing had happened.
    
    Desir smiled, and that smile widened until it threatened to split 
her orange face in two. That grin bared the blades of bone that were 
her teeth, glinting in the sun, while everyone else assumed the 
spectacle was over. It had worked. It had *worked*!
    
    All her planning and scheming for this one chance, and it had 
paid off! Her sorceress no longer existed in this world, but the pact 
had not been annulled! No sudden wrenching back to her harsh, 
unforgiving birthplace. No explosion of demonic essence into the air. 
Nothing. She was free!
    
    Free! The concept was the holy grail of any demon or demonette 
who had ever experienced another world! No more animal survival or 
scheming one-upmanship back in &#39;hell&#39;. No more bending and scraping 
to the sorcerer&#39;s every whim. All she had to do was stay within the 
guidelines of the pact that had been made, and she could live however 
she liked. Without the sorcerer to interpret it every which way, and 
dish out the punishment when their ideas were overstepped, it was 
perfection as far as any bound being was concerned.
    
    Then a hand lighted on her shoulder, she felt her power wrap 
itself around her as if it were a straightjacket, and her exultation 
shattered like sugar-glass. She turned to see Daltass standing there, 
a pleased, unthreatening smile on his face. The spell had already 
been cast. She had just been careless.
    
    &quot;I don&#39;t suppose we can come to some kind of agreement?&quot; she 
asked, but Daltass just shook his head with that same languid smile.
    
    Desir sighed in defeat. &quot;You jammy bastard. After the portal and 
that butch looker... you&#39;re going to be so sick after all this, you 
know that?&quot;
    
    Daltass nodded. &quot;I think I shall live.&quot; He pushed a little 
further, his eyes losing focus as he did.
    
    &quot;Hey, get out already!&quot; Desir exclaimed, already powerless thanks 
to the all but completed banishment spell. &quot;Whatever you&#39;re doing 
you&#39;d better stop or when I get called back up I&#39;ll make your 
ancestors wish you were never born!&quot;
    
    Daltass&#39; eyes re-focused and his smile returned. &quot;Just a little 
something to keep you otherwise engaged.&quot;
    
    Then, before Desir could issue her ready retort, Daltass&#39; hand 
left her shoulder, and the banishment took effect. With a scream and 
a single almighty lurch, like receiving a charging elephant to the 
small of the back, Desir was wrenched from reality and sent hurtling 
back between worlds. 
    
    She knew this little joke of fate&#39;s was going to stay etched on 
her mind for a long, long time. Just like the Seraphi, she was headed 
home too.
    
    &quot;Oh... Bugger it!&quot;

The End

***

Author&#39;s note: Only eight parts, two of which weren&#39;t even full 
length chapters, and it still took the best part of ten months to 
write! So, there you have it. Now I just have to see about getting 
around to a sequel! ^_^&#39;

Please send any comments and constructive criticism.

They are always greatly appreciated, and there is no better reward 
for a writer than to hear back from the readers.

Many thanks to Richard King for his proofreading assistance.
