<h1>Okaa-san? (part 1 of 6)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<pre>**I have to apologize in advance, Ami&#39;s a bit out of 
character...forgive me (^.^;) **

---------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;That&#39;s the fifth time tonight you&#39;ve looked over your shoulder&quot; 
Makoto said stopping to turn to her girlfriend, &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot;  

&quot;Nothing&quot; Ami replied, not at all convincingly. 

&quot;Nothing, eh&quot; Makoto repeated as she registered Ami&#39;s actions &quot;then 
why have you been looking around so much?&quot; Taking the smaller girls 
hand she began again &quot;all through the movie you were looking back into 
the tiers, I bet you can&#39;t even tell me what the movie was about.&quot; 

&quot;Um...&quot; Ami started, visibly making an effort to remember. A demure 
little smile played across her lips as she looked pointedly at Makoto 
then proceeded to give a summary of the movie.

Makoto wasn&#39;t so easily deluded, &quot;you know all of that because you 
read about it online.&quot; Scanning the streets herself before finally 
looking back to Ami &quot;C&#39;mon Ami-chan, tell me what&#39;s the problem.&quot;

Ami gave a heavy sigh as she began to walk down the street ahead of 
Makoto. &quot;Alright fine,&quot; Makoto said as she caught up to her &quot;you don&#39;t 
have to tell me, but...&quot; 

&quot;I think I&#39;m being followed&quot; Ami whispered to her, cutting her off. 

&quot;What?!&quot; Makoto asked. Concern written all over her face as she put 
her arm around the smaller girl, stopping her once again.

&quot;I&#39;ve had this feeling for the passed week, like someone&#39;s watching 
me.&quot;

&quot;All the time?&quot; Makoto asked calmly. She was angry, not at Ami but 
with this possible stalker. &#145;How dare they?&#39; she thought, however for 
Ami&#39;s sake she remained composed.

&quot;No, not all the time&quot; she said looking down the street as she 
instinctively moved closer to Makoto.  &quot;I feel fine when I&#39;m inside, 
like in school or at home...&quot; Looking up at Makoto she smiled and 
included &quot;and at you place.&quot; 

Nonetheless, Makoto wasn&#39;t having it. Her only thoughts were of Ami&#39;s 
safety. &quot;Why haven&#39;t you said anything before?&quot; Makoto began harshly, 
surprising Ami though by no means scaring her. &quot;Whoever&#39;s following 
you could be dangerous&quot; she stated.

&quot;I know&quot; she assured Makoto, &quot;I just thought no one would believe me.&quot; 
She paused looking at Makoto&#39;s livid countenance &quot;it is just a 
feeling.&quot;

&quot;So what?!&quot; Makoto said, now taking a more detailed look at their 
surroundings. &quot;They shouldn&#39;t be ignored&quot; looking back at Ami she 
asked &quot;have you noticed anyone around all the time?&quot;

Ami&#39;s face reddened as she studied the ground.

&quot;Oh Kami-sama!&quot; Makoto exclaimed, &quot;You have.&quot; Putting her anger in 
check, Makoto got her voice under control enough to say &quot;point &#145;em 
out.&quot;

Venturing a brief glance at Makoto Ami shook her head, &quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot;

Makoto stood there staring at Ami not knowing what to say to her. 
Ultimately, it was Ami who spoke again &quot;the next time I see her I&#39;ll 
point her out to you.&quot;

Makoto only nodded, taking Ami&#39;s hand as they resumed their walk to 
her apartment. &quot;Maybe we should call the police?&quot;

Ami knew Makoto was afraid for her, but she saw no point in calling 
the police and told her so.

Makoto said nothing, silently marinating in her anger.

&quot;I know there&#39;s not much the police can do&quot; she tried explaining to 
Makoto. &quot;And I don&#39;t think she&#39;s dangerous...&quot;

At this Makoto couldn&#39;t help but respond &quot;if you don&#39;t think she&#39;s 
dangerous then why have you been looking over your shoulders, hmm?&quot;

Ami sighed and started again &quot;I don&#39;t think she&#39;s dangerous because we 
are senshi...&quot;

Makoto stopped dead in her tracks, turning to Ami she asked &quot;do you 
think this is a new ene..&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;NO buts, I know she isn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll take your word for it.&quot;

After walking a few more blocks Makoto perked up, &quot;we are senshi&quot; she 
said proudly, even if it was only a whisper meant for Ami. &quot;We can 
take her whenever she finally makes her move.&quot;</pre>
