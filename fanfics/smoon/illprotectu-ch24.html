<h1>I'll Protect You (part 24 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>Rei held Minako&#39;s head lovingly. She looked at the blonde&#39;s eyes. They were tired, but still 
sparkly and beautiful.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me that you were here? I would have recognized you.&quot; Minako started.

&quot;I wanted to, really. But...&quot; Rei did not continue, because she promised Sanctuary not to 
tell anyone about them.

&quot;...But...what?&quot;

&quot;You...were confused. I&#39;ve been watching you from television and once I tried to chase after 
you because you were running and crying that time. That was like four days ago. When I got 
the chance to talk to you...you pushed me away.&quot; Rei said, embarrassingly.

Minako went pale as she recalled that day. &#39;So it wasn&#39;t a dream after all.&#39;

&quot;I...thought that you already remembered, and hated me for all the things that happened to 
you. I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Rei said guiltily. Minako looked at her surprisingly and held her lover&#39;s 
hand.

&quot;I would never hate you Rei-chan! I&#39;m sorry I was just so confused at that time.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to apologize.&quot; Rei said as she fixed Minako&#39;s blonde hair, she cursed 
mentally when she realized that Minako wasn&#39;t wearing any coat to warm her, and she&#39;s 
starting to feel the climate.

Rei immediately removed her lavender fur coat and wrapped it to her lover&#39;s fragile body.

&quot;B-but Rei-chan what about you, you&#39;ll catch a cold!&quot; Minako tried to remove the fur coat 
but Rei hugged her tight.

&quot;R-Rei-cha&acirc;&#128;&#148;&quot;

&quot;Save the talk later. Let&#39;s go to where I&#39;m staying at. I really missed you, Minako.&quot; Rei 
whispered to blonde&#39;s ear. Minako blushed and leaned her head to her lover&#39;s.

&quot;You never fail to dazzle me...I&#39;m all yours.&quot; She whispered shyly. Rei raised the hood of 
the fur coat and covered Minako&#39;s head to hide the pop star&#39;s identity. Rei once again 
kissed her blonde princess lovingly before gently letting go.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Minako asked as Rei picked up the books she bought that laid on the 
snowy ground.

&quot;I&#39;m going to call a cab or something available for us to ride.&quot; The pop star followed her 
and helped Rei pick up her books.

&quot;Rei-chan, I want to walk with you.&quot; Rei looked up, a little surprised. Minako&#39;s gaze was 
slowly melting the former policewoman. The blonde looked like a snow princess with her 
lavender winter coat.

&quot;Aren&#39;t you tired?&quot; The raven-haired girl asked worriedly. Minako shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;ve always wanted to do this with you. I think now is the perfect time.&quot; The blonde 
replied, blushing. Rei couldn&#39;t help but to smile. She picked up the last book and returned 
it to the paper bag with the rest of the books before standing up.

Minako noticed that Rei&#39;s clothes were not just ordinary clothes. Selected stores sell Rei&#39;s 
fit checkered blazer. Although the combination of grey and black only made Rei look more 
reserved, she still looked great overall along with the plain blue denims and brown laced 
high-heeled boots that was inches below her knees. How Rei could afford it didn&#39;t matter to 
Minako. She thought that it looked really good on her girlfriend.

&quot;So...What have you been doing when I&#39;m not around?&quot; The blonde asked. Rei didn&#39;t expect 
that question soon enough.

&quot;W-well...I&#39;ve been working undercover.&quot; The raven-haired girl replied. Minako wasn&#39;t 
satisfied with her answer though. The last vision came through her mind once again and made 
her nervous all of a sudden. Back in Tokyo, before they parted, Rei was yelling her name. 
Her tears were mixing with the blood flowing from her head injury. Minako wanted to move, 
and tell her that she&#39;s fine, but couldn&#39;t. Although she knew better that she was far from 
that.

&quot;You&#39;re head was bleeding.&quot; Minako said without thinking. Rei looked at her with disbelief 
and started to wipe her head with her free hand and looked back at it.

&quot;I don&#39;t see any blood.&quot; Rei said, her insides starting to panic. Minako looked at her 
lover&#39;s frightened face and giggled.

&quot;Silly Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;Hey, now I&#39;m silly.&quot; Rei snapped. She was obviously annoyed at that moment. Minako giggled 
because that part of Rei never changed. Her smile slowly faded as she recalled every detail 
before they got separated.

&quot;Come on, hear me out first. The last time I remembered...before I lost my memories...You 
were taken by a group of foreigners...Who are they? Did they hurt you? Why did they take you 
away from me?&quot; The blonde girl looked at her lover worriedly. Rei on the other hand was 
surprised at the sudden interrogation. She thought her answer carefully, making sure that 
there wouldn&#39;t be any lie and wouldn&#39;t blow up her cover at the same time.

&quot;...They are...They&#39;re my new companions...they helped me save you from the people who 
almost took you away from me that time...However, they needed something from me, and they 
didn&#39;t want you to be involved. That&#39;s why they took me away without you. I didn&#39;t have 
enough consciousness to refuse and fight from having myself taken away from you against my 
will. Minako, this is what I really want to tell you last time but...&quot; Rei was standing in 
front of Minako, holding her blonde love&#39;s timid shoulders. The former pop star felt her 
beloved&#39;s burden. It was like Rei was caught in the middle of something mysterious and 
dangerous at the same time. After all the confession Minako finally understood why Rei 
needed to hide something from her until now. It was all for her, for her safety, for her 
sake, and for their love.

Minako shoved Rei&#39;s hair and caressed her ruby lips as slow as she wished she could. The 
former cop looked at her anxiously. Her amethyst eyes filled with emotions that Minako 
missed so badly.

&quot;Rei-chan, I&#39;m sorry that I thought you were hiding things from me because I thought you 
didn&#39;t trust me enough. I just realized that it wasn&#39;t fair of me to expect what you should 
be doing...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you understand. I know it&#39;s also unfair that I couldn&#39;t tell you everything 
right now but please...trust me no matter what. And when I say &#39;I love you&#39;...I mean it. 
You&#39;re the only reason why I&#39;m enduring right now, the only reason why I have not given up 
after almost losing everything. I need you more than any entity in this world.&quot;

The former pop star smiled, tears falling from her eyes as she mentally repeated Rei&#39;s 
heart-flattering words. She would definitely remember those words for the rest of her life. 
Rei must have been very, very lonely without her. She felt guilty again for not being at her 
lover&#39;s side when they needed each other most. But now that they&#39;re together, she would 
never let anyone get in the way of their love. Rei wiped the tears as she appreciated 
Minako&#39;s smile and beauty at the same time.

&quot;Please don&#39;t cry. Your eyes are swollen already.&quot; Rei gently pleaded.

&quot;But I can&#39;t help it! I love you too much!&quot; The blonde said as more tears of joy fell down 
her cheeks. Rei chuckled mildly and wrapped her arms on Minako&#39;s shoulders. They continued 
walking to the silent, snowy streets of London.

---------

Minako for some reason was in high spirits although she looked a little tired. She insisted 
to stop from one place to another as they walk in the streets, much to Rei&#39;s slight dismay. 
They would stop and rest at every amusing place such as Christmas exhibits, where huge and 
colorful Christmas lanterns were displayed. There were also carolers. Rei planned on eating 
in a restaurant but didn&#39;t want to risk exposing Minako with her. However, the blonde had 
other things in mind. She led Rei and pointed every small take-out fast food stands that 
were still open and ate. They also stopped at selected candy shops to buy sweets. Rei did 
all the buying since Minako might be recognized. The former pop star felt like a child 
again. She had been to many famous restaurants when she was on her pop star days but never 
really enjoyed the food no matter how expensive and exquisite it was. This was her &#39;ideal 
date&#39;, with her &#39;ideal woman&#39;. Rei never thought that she would enjoy Christmas this much, 
especially with Minako having fun by her side. The noisy, outgoing and happy Minako was 
slowly going back.

The couple went back to where Rei was staying at that moment. Minako was amazed that Rei 
could afford staying in a luxurious hotel suite. The living room had huge sun jars in every 
corner, giving the room a dim aura. The sofa set was Asian inspired; which was recognizable 
because of its detailed embroidery. In the middle of it were a stylish glass table and a 
huge flat TV which Rei never used. Opposite the living room was a small dining area. Beside 
the bedroom was a stainless steel-themed kitchen with complete utensils. And to Minako&#39;s 
delight, there was also a huge bath with Jacuzzi inside. The blonde circled curiously around 
the place while Rei arranged the books she had bought for herself.

&quot;Wow, this is incredible! I&#39;ve been to somewhere like this but this sure is a lot bigger!&quot; 
Minako took one last look around before looking at her lover. Rei noticed her lover&#39;s 
questioning gaze; she knew that the blonde girl was hesitating to ask her a question.

&quot;It belongs to my comrade&#39;s friend. I was fortunate to be able to stay here for a few days.&quot; 
When the raven-haired girl noticed that her answer wasn&#39;t enough, she continued.

&quot;...You know that I couldn&#39;t tell you everything right now. But there is something I want to 
tell you. Whoever I&#39;m working for right now knew something about my past and it&#39;s something 
I need to once again uncover. However, I believe they do not exactly intend to do something 
immoral. Everything&#39;s at risk right now Minako...even you. That&#39;s why I need you to do 
something for me...&quot;

&quot;...What is it?&quot;

&quot;Everyone in Tokyo thought I disappeared...or probably was killed as far as I know. That&#39;s 
why they didn&#39;t want to tell you about me, I couldn&#39;t blame them either. They...the ones 
that I am working for right now didn&#39;t want me to be discovered alive in any way. That&#39;s why 
I&#39;ve been forced to watch you from shadows ever since you arrived in Europe. I need you to 
pretend that you&#39;ve never met me here, or that I&#39;m not here at all.&quot;

&quot;But...so will this mean that you won&#39;t be with me always?&quot;

&quot;I will be, it&#39;s just I can&#39;t stay all the time. If I have to see you every day or night, I 
will. After that, when everything&#39;s settled with them, I can finally be with you. Every 
hour, every second of every day, I promise you that.&quot;

Minako smiled and shook her head.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to make a promise, I trust you with all my heart. I&#39;ll do what I can to help 
you with this. Although I&#39;m a little angry that they took you away from me...I want to thank 
them, for taking care of you when I&#39;m not around.&quot;

Rei sighed in relief. If there was one thing about Minako that changed, it was her being 
more matured. She held her blonde lover&#39;s arms and leaned her forehead on Minako&#39;s, smelling 
her love&#39;s scent to calm her nerves. They started doing waltz for a few minutes before Rei 
spoke.

&quot;You&#39;ve changed. I so proud of you, but I still like my old Mina-chan though.&quot; The blonde 
smirked. She pushed the former police to the nearest wall and kissed her passionately. Rei 
was surprised by the sudden action.

&quot;You were saying? I was just being polite at first, you know, after being separated for a 
while and everything. The moment my memories came back, my naughtiness and my ecchiness came 
along with it as well.&quot; Minako whispered huskily on Rei&#39;s ear and sent shivers all over her 
body. Damn, she&#39;s right and she missed that too.

&quot;Hey, I thought it&#39;s my turn this time?&quot; Rei protested as Minako already started removing 
her girlfriend&#39;s blazer. The raven-haired girl noticed her blonde love&#39;s face was a little 
flushed. As the other girl slowly undressed her, Rei placed her hand on Minako&#39;s forehead 
and felt her temperature. The other hand moved down to her lover&#39;s right cheek.

&quot;I think it&#39;s too soon for us to do this again, Minako.&quot; Rei said gently as she hugged the 
other girl who stopped halfway from unzipping the brunette&#39;s jeans.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Minako pouted but Rei kept a stern face.

&quot;You may not realize it but it bothers me to look at your obviously tired face. I think 
you&#39;re even a little feverish.&quot; Minako put her own hand on her forehead and she was indeed a 
little hot. She puffed her cheeks and looked at Rei with puppy eyes.

&quot;But, I really want to do it with you right now...&quot;

&quot;Believe me, I want it badly, too. But I had to stop myself. I don&#39;t want you to catch a 
cold or worse, flu. There is always tomorrow.&quot; Rei said in a sweet tone as she wrapped her 
arms on Minako&#39;s now lazy shoulders. The blonde took the opportunity to stare and enjoy 
Rei&#39;s shirtless form. Her hands wandered from the raven-haired girl&#39;s breasts down to her 
flat stomach. Rei&#39;s body remained the same. It never failed to arouse her. She wanted not to 
resist but when her eyes landed on Rei&#39;s left shoulder, she stopped. There was a small 
medical plaster that covered the former policewoman&#39;s injury. She remembered Rei being shot 
by one of the people who almost kidnapped her. She lifted the other girl&#39;s bandaged arm and 
caressed it lightly as she spoke.

&quot;Okay...But you&#39;ll have to take care of me until I get better...and then we can do that, 
right?&quot; Minako thought it was embarrassing to still think of sex after everything that 
happened but she just really wanted to be with Rei, to talk to her, to make love to her 
everyday if she could. That&#39;s what she really felt and she didn&#39;t want to deny it. Rei 
nodded in response and bent down to retrieve her long-sleeved blazer. She was about to wear 
it when Minako stole it from her hands.

&quot;Minako...?&quot;

&quot;...At least let me have some fun...by seeing you without this.&quot; The raven-haired girl was 
surprised when the blonde threw her stolen clothes a few feet away. The blonde hugged her 
beloved and slowly rubbed herself on Rei&#39;s bare front as the raven-haired girl moaned from 
the bold contact. Minako received a light kiss on the forehead and she lifted her head to 
reach the other girl&#39;s lips. She received some quick and hungry kisses from Rei but the 
former pop-star gave a hint for a hot, passionate kiss by opening her mouth, which Rei 
gladly took. The kiss lasted longer than both of them expected. They have never done this 
even when they were together before. Perhaps it was because they were separated for a while. 
However, it was fate that they wanted to thank most that they were together right now. Even 
if there were upcoming obstacles in their relationship, they knew if they trust and love 
each other, they would make it no matter what.

&quot;If you&#39;re going to&acirc;&#128;&#148;take care of me...you should...give me satisfaction...slave.&quot; Minako 
whispered as she finally felt the need to breathe from the kiss. The other girl smiled.

&quot;I&#39;m going to spoil you then, my queen.&quot; Rei breathed as she offered her other hand which 
Minako took and led her to the huge bed.

Minako&#39;s clothes and undergarments were replaced by a red silk sleeping robe. She hated to 
take some medicine but since Rei was taking care of her, she would take even the most 
bitter-tasting medicine. She allowed her lover to wipe and cool her body down with a wet 
towel. The blonde would moan when Rei purposely wiped her sensitive areas, particularly her 
breasts. She knew Rei felt a little guilty for not doing it with her that night. But having 
her lover take care of her in an erotic way was not so bad at all. In fact, she loved it 
too. Finally, sleep took over her exhausted body. Everything that happened the past month, 
the wariness, the loneliness and doubt quickly disappeared. All it took was to sleep beside 
her most beloved, Rei.

-Sanctorium-

Mark was sitting on his study area silently in the middle of the night. He was researching 
online something using his laptop. He found out that the former politician, the mastermind 
behind his parents&#39; death, LudwigDuckheimer IV was found dead in one of his rest houses in 
Dublin two weeks after Sanctuary&#39;s unexpected visit. He was very sure that the one who 
killed him was none other than Stephen Shards because of the evidence, the same weird-shaped 
figurine left beside the corpse and the way the former politician was killed, suffer first 
then die. He smirked mentally when he read that Sanctuary was one of the main suspects 
because of the stunt they did almost fours weeks ago in the former politician&#39;s mansion. He 
just couldn&#39;t figure out why that man would kill someone who hired him before. Maybe someone 
else hired him to kill the former cabinet member. The mystery behind this murderous man only 
made Mark desire more vengeance.

It had been months&acirc;&#128;&#148;no years since he decided to seek revenge for his parents and his wife. 
Normally, in front of everyone, he wore a very thick mask. This mask shadowed his emotions, 
his doubts, especially his fears. At times like this when he was alone, he would think 
twice. Was he really doing the right thing? He knew it was already too late to ask that 
question. He knew that many things had happen, and there wasn&#39;t any way to bring it all back 
to normal. They had killed many people, including innocent ones, involved five young and 
talented people because of his selfish desires. He had hurt so many to satisfy his hunger 
for revenge; of course the recent victim was none other than Rei. It was all like a 
nightmare to him, how he wished it never happened. However, he already started this, and 
he&#39;d be the one who would finish this. That was the only thought that kept him going. He 
knew that he was no different from the ones involved in his family&#39;s death. But the 
difference was he knew when to stop when it&#39;s too much.

&quot;You know you&#39;re the only person I know who would sulk and does self-reflecting every 
Christmas.&quot; The sandy blonde-haired Henry said as he entered the study. He was holding two 
cups of hot chocolate and placed the other one on the table in front of Mark. The red-eyed 
man just looked at it.

&quot;Drink, you know I hate coffee. I made it extra special. Try to loosen up sometimes, Mark.&quot;

&quot;I am doing that right now.&quot;

&quot;No, what I meant is try to have some fun. You&#39;re still young, yet you act like a 50-year 
old geezer who thinks that even breathing was his burden.&quot;

&quot;...Perhaps I am like that.&quot; Mark said as he picked up the cup in front of him. Henry 
frowned and sighed.

&quot;Don&#39;t be so selfish. What would Edward and the others think? They joined Sanctuary, 
believing that you gave them a reason to continue living. No matter how unexpected things 
turn out, we will always be on your side. Despite all the bad things that happened, we don&#39;t 
care. You...gave us a place where we belong. You gave us a home to return to...Oh, man...now 
I sound like a drama actor! What a loser...&quot; Henry laughed at himself and scratched his head 
with a free hand. He stopped when Mark closed his eyes, seconds after he surprised the 
blonde man by laughing out loud. It sounded menacing, but Henry knew better that it was 
Mark&#39;s natural laugh. As the laugh died down, he took a sip of the hot chocolate.

&quot;I don&#39;t know what I did that you guys are still here, helping me out despite the cold 
personality I posses. Even if there is a part of hatred burning inside of me, there was also 
a part that was glad that I am here right now, with these people who trusted their future to 
me...I owe you one, Henry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing. I&#39;m just a little concerned that the ones that are always having fun were the 
four of us and not you. But ever since the cop girl came into our group, you showed a little 
emotion, you even had fun by teasing her.&quot;

&quot;...Is that so? That girl is just too stubborn than anyone I knew, sometimes I don&#39;t know 
what to do with her. Although I admit that seeing her cute, annoyed face already became a 
habit of ours. Plus, she made our stalking job easier.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to wait a few more days before that short-tempered girl comes back. For the 
meantime,&quot; Henry walked towards the door and opened it quickly to reveal Edward, Leonard and 
Grey listening on the other side of the door. Realizing that they were caught, they all 
quickly composed themselves and smiled gingerly at the other two.

&quot;And I suppose you did not happen to pass by, did you?&quot; Mark said, smiling a little. Grey 
was the first one to talk.

&quot;Well, yeah&acirc;&#128;&#148;No, no...um...we were just wondering if both of you were planning to enjoy 
Christmas by talking about unnecessary things&acirc;&#128;&#148;erm, not that necessary but&acirc;&#128;&#148;&quot;

&quot;We kinda decided to cook...although the food looked weird I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like it.&quot; Leonard 
chuckled.

&quot;It&#39;s a little lonely without Rei-san, though. But Grey said we&#39;ll have another celebration 
with her once she goes back. Right now we really want you to celebrate and have fun with us, 
Mark.&quot; Edward said, playing with a red and green feather.

&quot;...I guess I&#39;ll have to take out that fifteen year-old whine I was saving...&quot;

--Somewhere in an abandoned building, Dublin--

Christmas Eve. It was a very normal day for a certain murderer. He never believed in 
anything, for death was the only thing that was certain for him. The day that his eyes 
opened he already knew he was destined to be a psycho killer. He was a special case. He was 
more than aware of his surroundings, like he was a part of it. He was like a living death 
god, designed to inflict pain and suffering. He had outstanding skills, but was used to 
destroy his own kind for money. He had been silent for years, thinking that everything was 
just too boring for him.

However, recently, something caught his attention. He had ignored Sanctuary before because 
he thought they were just one of those lame youngsters who foolishly tried to seek him for 
revenge and gave up, until he saw them in television. For some reason, he was highly amused 
that they went back for more. He had heard many great things from this group, particularly 
Mark, the leader of the group. He also heard that some of them were &#39;gifted&#39; like him. He 
smiled menacingly; this only meant one thing for him, a game. He picked up a piece of wood 
and started to carve something with a small but sharp knife. He was watching a video 
recording of Sanctuary&#39;s appearance in Ludwig Duckheimer&#39;s mansion four weeks ago using an 
old television.

&quot;So...you still chose seek me, Mark Lindeburg? And what do we have here...a little sixth 
member? I say I have seen those violet eyes before...but I hardly remember when, though...&quot;

&quot;Maybe she&#39;s one of those hookers you had slept with before?&quot; An annoyed and jealous voice 
of a woman was heard. The man ignored what the woman said.

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. You&#39;re the only woman I&#39;ve slept with and allowed to live...I&#39;m not sure 
why Mark would recruit a timid looking girl though. But if he wants a challenge...I shall 
gladly give it to him. I&#39;ve never been this excited before.&quot; He finally said before blowing 
the bits of carved wood from the finished product and placed it with the rest of the 
figurines he made on a small old table.

-Back at the Hotel Suite-

Rei couldn&#39;t sleep. She was either too happy or was too overwhelmed to do so. At first she 
thought it was just a dream, but the feeling of her bare skin on Minako&#39;s was enough proof 
that it wasn&#39;t. Besides, she promised she&#39;d take care of her blonde lover. To her relief, 
Minako&#39;s fever completely disappeared. Now, all the girl needed was a good sleep.

She recalled everything that happened since she met Minako. She recalled her treasured 
memories with the blonde, the complicated situations. But the memory that scared her the 
most was seeing Minako injured, hurt, there was so much blood that she never want it 
remembered anymore. She just realized that losing Minako was her greatest fear. She had 
thought of so many things when she was with Sanctuary, but never thought of anything like 
this. The anger she felt for herself still existed. For her, being unable to protect Minako 
was definitely unacceptable. She swore to herself that she would never let anything happen 
to her lover, that she would protect Minako with her life.

Looking at the blonde&#39;s restless form for a few minutes, Rei couldn&#39;t help but to take 
advantage of the unconscious beauty in her arms. She traced the shape of the girl&#39;s perfect 
face, she let her fingers linger on the shaped nose and finally, she traced the pale-pink 
lips that she was kissing earlier. Rei leaned and kissed it lightly, and then ever slowly, 
she trailed her lips down on Minako&#39;s sexy neck and collar bone. It took all control she had 
left to stop herself from doing &#39;perverted&#39; things on her sleeping lover. The blonde girl 
shifted as her sleeping head leaned just below Rei&#39;s cheek. Her wandering right hand seemed 
to be trying to find something. Found it. The hand finally rested on one of Rei&#39;s breasts. 
The raven-haired girl sighed and contented her self by smelling Minako&#39;s scent and by 
hugging her in a most possessive way possible. She had let Minako&#39;s cotton candy scent fill 
her lungs and finally lulled her to sleep.

&#39;Tell me, what is our ending? Will it be beautiful?&#39;
