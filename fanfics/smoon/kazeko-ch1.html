*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka looked at herself in the full-length mirror in the spare bedroom, 
smoothing down the white dress shirt over her semi-flat chest and 
reaching for her vest.  She stared at her strong hand, long fingers, 
slight tan, toughened by years of throwing around massive amounts of 
energy as Sailor Uranus and wielding an incredibly powerful sword.  She 
turned her long hand over, looking at her finely lined palm, remembering 
back to the days when she was a student at Mugen Gakuen, when she was 
looking for the talismans hidden in her pure heart crystal, when all she 
could see was blood.  In her mind, she heard her beloved Michiru&#39;s words 
of comfort from those days: &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Haruka; I like your hands.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled her hand to her chest and held it, brilliant green eyes 
sparkling, a slow smile spreading across her face.  Michiru.  Gods, but 
she loved that woman.  She had known her since Junior High, since she 
discovered that she shared a destiny with the most beautiful woman in 
the world.  And now that they had finished not only High School but also 
college and were preparing for their own new careers, she and Michiru 
could be much more than mere girlfriends, Senshi partners in service to 
their young princess.  Pulling her attention back to the task at hand, 
Haruka slipped her arms into her vest and pulled on her dark navy 
jacket.
 
&quot;Ruka?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m ready when you are,&quot; Haruka called back, looking at the closed 
bedroom door where her lover was dressing, knowing that her Michi was 
not yet ready.  That was fine with her.  Haruka checked the clock before 
picking up the one piece of jewelry Michiru had given her, one of the 
few necklaces she consented to wear.  It was a beautiful dark gold piece 
of amber, colorful iridescent scales buried in the depths of the 
petrified sap roughly forming the symbol of Uranus.  It gave Haruka a 
sense of power to hold the lifeblood of a tree that had been extinct for 
hundreds of thousands of years.  The piece of amber, almost a perfect 
heart shape, hung from a golden chain that sparkled in the light of the 
guest room where Haruka had been exiled when Michiru wanted to dress 
alone, away from her lover&#39;s amorous hands and time-wasting plans.  
Haruka fastened the chain around her neck, glancing at her reflection in 
the mirror once more.  The dark navy suit made the tall tomboy look even 
taller, and her short boots reminded her of her Sailor fuku.  She ran a 
hand through her short blonde hair, watching it fall back into place, 
revealing the tiny hoop earrings she always wore.
 
&quot;I am now.  Coming, Ruka, or should I call a taxi?&quot;
 
&quot;If it comes to that,&quot; Haruka laughed, &quot;you can drive yourself.&quot;  She 
exited the guest room, knowing that Michiru wasn&#39;t out of the bedroom 
yet.  Setsuna had taken Hotaru shopping with Usagi, Mamoru, and the 
Inner Senshi, giving Haruka and Michiru time to perform at the diner 
they frequented before they all met for dinner at their favorite 
restaurant.  They only had one performance before the meeting, and they 
were going to be late if a certain violinist didn&#39;t hurry up.  The 
subject of the pianist&#39;s thoughts coughed discreetly behind her, closing 
their bedroom door, and the taller woman turned slowly to look at her.
 
She gasped.
 
In the years since Haruka had met the aqua-haired beauty, Michiru had 
grown from a stunning young lady just discovering her sexual potential 
to a drop-dead gorgeous woman fully aware of her effect on all men and 
her lover Haruka.  Her hair, longer than it had been when two Junior 
High students met each other on a dusty racetrack so long ago and so far 
away, now rippled down her back like a shimmering waterfall, just 
caressing her slender waist.  Her pale blue dress hemmed in lavender and 
covered in tiny white flowers hugged her breasts and hips; sleeveless, 
with a low neckline and virtually no back, the dress accented her 
sea-blue hair and deep sapphire eyes.  Her white skin seemed to glow 
with an inner light that had nothing to do with her immense Senshi 
powers, and Haruka could feel the joy pulsing off her girlfriend in 
waves.  Kaiou Michiru smiled at the blonde, tilting her head in 
amusement.  &quot;See anything you like, Haruka?&quot;  She fingered the 
aquamarine pendant hanging from her slender neck before turning her 
attention back to her lover.
 
Haruka nodded, swallowing.  &quot;Beautiful,&quot; she managed.  &quot;I don&#39;t think 
I&#39;m dressed well enough to escort you tonight.&quot;
 
Michiru laughed as she threaded her arm through Haruka&#39;s, pointing her 
girlfriend toward the door and the car outside.  &quot;Flattery will get you 
nowhere, Ruka, however, a kiss and I&#39;m all yours.&quot;  She smiled at the 
expression on her girlfriend&#39;s face as they reached the door.  &quot;On a 
more serious note, you look very handsome tonight, Haruka.  I wouldn&#39;t 
go with anyone else.&quot;
 
The two women had attended the same arts college for four years, both 
majoring in music and visual art.  Haruka told everybody that she wasn&#39;t 
much of an artist, but her lover disagreed, and after the world returned 
to normal following Haruka&#39;s wish more than six years earlier, Michiru 
encouraged the racer&#39;s artistic talent.  Now their paintings were always 
displayed in one exhibit, and Haruka had received many medals and much 
fame, especially since most of the world thought that she was a man and 
her paintings were fairly delicate and &quot;feminine.&quot;  They also performed 
concerts together and had toured Japan many times since High School, 
even doing two overseas trips.  Their fame did not tempt them long, and 
the famous Kaiou-Ten&#39;ou duet never failed to perform for the customers 
at their favorite nightclub at least once a month.
 
The drive to the club was silent, both women lost in their own thoughts.  
Michiru kept glancing over at Haruka, wondering why the taller woman was 
so uncharacteristically nervous and unusually reserved.  She had never 
expressed any fear at not being good enough for Michiru, except for the 
little incident with the wish.  It was just a performance at their 
favorite old haunt, not a concert for the emperor and his family.  It 
was no different from their hundreds of other duets, and Haruka had 
written three of the songs they were to perform.  She should be a little 
apprehensive that the customers would not like her music, though they 
always did, but that was not the sense Michiru was getting from her 
lover.  It was almost like Haruka was afraid of her partner, and that 
made no sense at all to the aqua-haired woman.  It wasn&#39;t their 
anniversary, it wasn&#39;t anyone&#39;s birthday, and it wasn&#39;t a holiday.  So 
why was tonight so very special?  What could it possibly be?  Haruka&#39;s 
mind remained closed to her partner.
 
The silent blonde could see her hands shaking almost imperceptibly on 
the steering wheel, palms sweating uncontrollably.  She had fought enemy 
after enemy as Sailor Uranus, including the Messiah of Silence, 
Nehelenia, and Galaxia, but she had never trembled.  She died, Michiru 
by her side, after sacrificing herself and betraying her princess for 
the sake of the mission, but she was never afraid.  Desperate to calm 
her nerves, Haruka rested her hand on the gearshift, letting the purring 
rhythm and vibrations of her car soothe her shattered nerves.  She 
jumped as Michiru&#39;s warm hand slid over hers, glancing over at the 
younger woman.  &quot;Michi?&quot;
 
Michiru stared straight ahead, smiling, letting the warmth and 
reassurance of her hand provide Haruka with the support she so 
desperately needed.  Haruka relaxed, letting her thoughts calm and her 
worries blow away with the wind as the pair sped toward their 
destination.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru and Haruka finished the song, both bowing, the aqua-haired woman 
reluctantly letting her mind return to the mundane plane from its flight 
with Haruka far above the earth.  In the past, before she met her 
soulmate, Michiru&#39;s spirit wandered alone during her performances, and 
she always knew that she was missing something.  With Haruka, though, 
she felt complete, their minds and spirits so closely linked that 
neither felt complete without the other.  The muted applause as the 
music faded was the rowdiest the small, elegant nightclub would support, 
but the only person that mattered to Michiru was her partner standing at 
the piano.  Haruka bowed again, gesturing for Michiru to wait before 
leaving the stage.  She took center stage and cleared her throat, 
waiting for the noise to die down.
 
&quot;Michiru and I have been performing together at least since we began 
High School seven years ago, and we have been playing duets here almost 
that long, certainly before I became known for the piano.  That is why I 
chose this diner for tonight.&quot;  Michiru looked at her lover, eyebrows 
raised, as the tall blonde turned to face her.  &quot;Michiru, we have been 
together for a long time, and I would like for &#39;a long time&#39; to become 
&#39;forever&#39;.&quot;  She crouched down on one knee, pulling a small blue box out 
of her pocket, watching as Michiru&#39;s sapphire eyes filled with tears.  
The aqua-haired senshi swallowed, hands flying to her mouth as she began 
to shake her head almost imperceptibly in wonder. 
 
Haruka opened the box.
 
A sigh spread through the room at the absolute beauty of the ring that 
shone brightly enough to be visible to every patron of the diner.  
&quot;Aishiteru, Michiru,&quot; the blonde senshi whispered.  &quot;Will you marry me?&quot;
 
Absolute silence reigned in the diner as Haruka held her breath, blood 
pounding in her ears, heart beating as fiercely as if she had just run a 
marathon, her entire world hanging on her lover&#39;s answer.  She could 
feel the other diners leaning forward in their seats, praying for her.
 
Michiru reached out one trembling hand, finger just barely brushing 
across the tiny diamond flower on the golden band, and her sudden 
half-sob broke the tension in the room.  &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered, tears 
running down her cheeks.  &quot;Kami-sama, yes, Haruka.&quot;
 
The blonde pulled the delicate ring out of the box and slipped it on 
Michiru&#39;s slender finger, biting her lip until it was safely on.  She 
had been so afraid that it wouldn&#39;t fit.
 
Suddenly overwhelmed by the sheer reality of her lover&#39;s answer, Haruka 
shot to her feet and pulled Michiru into her arms, kissing her as cheers 
sounded through the formerly quiet room.  Gods she loved this woman!</pre>
