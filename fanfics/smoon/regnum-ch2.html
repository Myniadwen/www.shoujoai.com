Hey Ami!  I hope your having fun in America.  I miss you sooooo 
much! (T__T)  Things here are fine.  I&#39;m not doing as well in my 
classes without you to help me study but I made Mamo-chan promise 
to help me instead!  (*^_^*)  Please don&#39;t be sad that no one has 
written to you.  They are all doing good and miss you too!  I 
think that Mako-chan is still a little mad but you know how she 
can be sometimes.  I really think you did do the right thing and 
I think everyone else knows that too.  I feel bad that I didnt do 
something sooner cause I&#39;m the princess so I feel like its my 
responsability. I am going to talk to Rei-chan.  I promise.  
Please dont stay away from us too long and please remember to 
bring me lots of neat American things when you return like a 
cowboy hat maybe.  Will write more soon, love Usagi!  (^_-)

Usagi-chan,

I can&#39;t tell you how happy I was to hear from you.  Ever since I 
left, I have felt horrible inside worrying about what kind of 
trouble I may have caused with my videotape.  I still think I did 
the right thing, but I also know I may have hurt all of you and 
that makes me so sad.  I am glad to hear that you are going to 
talk to Rei soon.  I know you will say the right things to her.  
You are really wonderful at that kind of thing.  

Things here are going very well.  My course load is a little bit 
lighter than I am used to, so I have found time to do lots of 
extra activities.  Many of the exchange students simply hang out 
together and don&#39;t bother to make friends with the American 
students, but I have tried to avoid doing that.  I joined the 
computer club and the chess club and there are a couple other 
social clubs that I may join.  San Francisco is a beautiful city, 
though it is not as close to campus as I originally thought.  You 
would be proud of me because I am making a special effort not to 
spend all of my time studying, but to go out and make new 
friends.  Of course, no one can ever compare to you or the other 
girls and I miss you all so very much.  

Please give my best to everyone, especially you-know-who.  

All my love!

Ami  (^_^)

--------------------------------------------
Dear Ami-chan,

I hope you don&#39;t mind that I&#39;m writing to you in the old-
fashioned way, but I don&#39;t have easy access to e-mail and I 
wouldn&#39;t use it anyway for anything of importance.  Usagi told us 
all that you were doing well.  I don&#39;t think anyone doubted that 
you would.   I&#39;m glad and I&#39;m very happy for you.  

Let me be direct.  Part of me is still very angry with you.  You 
left us, Ami-chan.  You dropped an explosive into our sanctuary 
and fled the country.  I know why you did it.  I may even agree 
that it needed to be done, but part of me still thinks that the 
way you did it was just wrong.  We could have sorted these things 
out together, the way we&#39;ve always dealt with crises.  

I suppose, though, that that was the whole point of your 
leaving, to get us to do things differently from the ways we&#39;d 
always done them.  It may surprise you to learn (but probably 
not) that that is the part of your message that hit closest to 
home for me.  Truthfully, I&#39;d never really noticed Minako&#39;s 
feelings for me.  Yes, I&#39;d noted some of her behavior around me, 
but I&#39;d shut that part of myself away for so long that it was 
completely numb.  I don&#39;t even know if I still love Usagi the way 
I did back then.  It took me so long to figure out that the 
strong emotion she brought out in me was love, and then so much 
longer to come to terms with the fact that she never would, never 
could, return that love in the way I wished.  I just went cold 
inside. It is so easy to pretend, Ami-chan.  You see a pretty 
boy; you go ga-ga over him, sigh heavily; and then you get on 
with your life. No need to ever look inside or consider your 
feelings.  Maybe I did know about how Minako felt, just like you 
said maybe Usagi knew about how I felt.  The problem for me is 
that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m capable of feeling anything anymore.

After your video ended, I left the room and went outside.  I 
found myself in a quiet corner of the garden, sitting on a bench.  
I knew then that you were right, that something had to change.  
I&#39;ve always wanted to be a career woman, to travel the world, but 
I&#39;ve also always loved my work in the shrine, helping others.  I 
think I know now what I need to do.  

I miss you, you know.  I miss having you here.  My life has been 
out of balance ever since you left. Grandpa doesn&#39;t want me to 
go, but he understands too.  You can&#39;t grow without change.  I 
guess I should thank you for helping me see that.  

I don&#39;t know what the others are going to do.  I know Makoto was 
very angry.  People think that I have a lot of anger inside me, 
and I have some, but hers goes much deeper I think.  You know as 
well as I, though, that she is one of the most loving and caring 
people in the world.  You hurt her, but she&#39;ll come to understand 
as I have and I hope she&#39;ll forgive you, too.  I think we&#39;ve all 
hurt each other, though none of us ever meant to.  Maybe that&#39;s 
all necessary too.  

Usagi is coming over later today.  I can guess why.  I can 
visualize almost exactly what she will say, how she will say it.  
I know it will break my heart and I also know that somehow, at 
the end of it, she will make me feel better about everything and 
leave me with the hope to move forward.  How could I have been 
expected not to love someone like that?  I&#39;m just surprised the 
rest of you don&#39;t as well.   Maybe you all do.  

I suppose I owe Minako the same courtesy, but I don&#39;t know what I 
can say to her.  Like I said, I think I knew, but I didn&#39;t know 
at the same time.  I haven&#39;t had time to figure out how I feel.  
It&#39;s all too much.  Maybe I owe it to her not to speak with her 
until I have something coherent to say.  I do love her.  In a lot 
of ways, she is very similar to Usagi, but without all of the 
annoying habits.  *smile*

Anyway, I just wanted you to know that I love you, Ami-chan.  I 
look forward to the day we meet again, no matter how distant that 
day may be.  When things settle out, I will write to you again to 
let you know how to stay in touch with me. 

Rei
