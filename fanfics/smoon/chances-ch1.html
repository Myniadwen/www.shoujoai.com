<h1>Chances Are</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto tossed in her bed, trying her best to stop thinking about
Minako. It was late at night, almost midnight but she couldn&#39;t sleep. She
wanted nothing more than to see Minako at that very moment. Loving
her best friend was becoming all too much for her. Ignoring her better
judgment she got out of bed and decided to take a walk... Knowing
exactly where she would end up.

She grabbed her shoes and a jacket and left her apartment on her way to
Minako&#39;s. She knew she was insane going out so late at night just to go
stare at Minako&#39;s house. But she also knew she wanted to be as close to
Minako as possible, and right now this was as close as she could get.
As she walked down the street a song she heard earlier that day came to
mind and she began singing the lyrics to herself.

Chances are you&#39;ll find me
Somewhere on your road tonight
Seems I always end up driving by
Ever since I&#39;ve known you
It seems you&#146;re on my way
All the rules of logic don&#39;t apply.

I long to see you in the night,
Be with you &#39;till morning light.

Makoto found herself standing outside of Minako&#39;s house much faster
than she had expected. She didn&#39;t know where to go from there so she
stood there, unmoving for a long time. As she looked up at Minako&#39;s
window she figured her angel must be sleeping. A solitary tear rolled
down her cheek and she headed back home to deal with another night of
complete emptiness.

_____

Minako lay in bed, looking at a picture of her and Makoto through the
dim light provided by the moon. She wanted nothing more than to tell
Makoto of her feelings but was afraid of ruining their friendship, and
risking Makoto being angry with her. She trailed her fingertips along
the picture wishing it really was Makoto she was touching at that
moment.

I remember clearly
How you looked the night we met
I recall your laughter and your smile
I remember how you made me
Feel so at ease
I remember all your grace, your style.

And now your all I long to see
You&#39;ve come to mean so much to me.

Minako clutched the picture to close to her chest and began to cry. She
had never wanted anything in all her life like she wanted Makoto&#39;s love.
&quot;I have to see you,&quot; she whispered quietly to the picture. She climbed
out of bed and checked to make sure no one was around. When she saw
the coast was clear she snuck out of her house with every intention of
going to Makoto and confessing her love despite her fear of how it may
end.

Makoto had decided to take the long way home through the park. All
that was at home waiting for her was an empty bed, and that&#39;s the last
place she wanted to be at the moment. As she looked down at her watch
she noticed it was now almost one in the morning. She knew she had
school in the morning so she reluctantly made herself go home.

She walked slowly up the stairs to her apartment, in no hurry to face
another night alone. When she got to her apartment what she saw was
the last thing she expected. &quot;Minako?&quot; she questioned now unsure if
this was really happening or just a dream.

Minako didn&#39;t say anything but instead walked to Makoto and wrapped
her arms around her hugging her tight. After a minute Makoto
reluctantly broke the embrace wanting to know what was happening.
For the first time she looked into Minako&#39;s eyes and noticed they were
all red and puffy as if she had been crying. &quot;Are you okay?&quot; Makoto
asked concerned.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not.&quot; Minako said once the two stepped inside Makoto&#39;s
apartment. &quot;I can&#39;t..stop...Mako-chan..I try but I just can&#39;t..I&#39;m sorry..&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get it Minako. You&#146;re not making sense.&quot; Makoto sat on the
floor in front of where Minako had sat on the couch.

&quot;Why have you been crying Makoto?&quot; Minako asked trying to get
Makoto to say what was in both their hearts first. Makoto only turned
away, unable to face telling Minako her true feelings. Minako held out
her hand and ran her fingers through Makoto&#39;s hair. &quot;Tell me, I need to
hear it Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto could only look at Minako dumbfounded. She had no clue
what was happening, or why but when she looked in Minako&#39;s eyes she
noticed something she hadn&#39;t before. Something that gave her the
courage to take Minako&#39;s hand into her own, and simply say, &quot;I love
you.&quot;

Minako looked down at Makoto, wanting to speak but found that she
was speechless. She had imagined, over and over, what it would be like
to hear Makoto to say that but never had she imagined it would leave
her speechless. She did the only thing she could think of, and lifted
Makoto&#39;s face up to hers and kissed her softly. When the two broke
apart Minako found that she was able to speak again. &quot;I love you too
Mako-chan,&quot; she softly whispered.

&quot;Are you going to get in trouble for being here?&quot; Makoto asked as she
wrapped her arms around Minako and lovingly played with her hair.

&quot;No, my parents won&#39;t notice. I&#39;m usually gone before they even wake
up. But it&#39;s late and we should get some sleep since we have school in
the morning.&quot; Minako smiled as she stood up bringing Makoto up with
her.

&quot;I...umm..&quot; Makoto began to mumble incoherently to herself.

&quot;Is there something you wanted to say?&quot; Minako asked as she wrapped
her arms around Makoto&#39;s waist.

&quot;Well uhh..&quot; Makoto felt like a five year old but was still scared to ask
what she wanted. &quot;Minako, will you be my girlfriend?&quot; Makoto blurted
out as her face turned red.

&quot;You are just too adorable.&quot; Minako said kissing Makoto again. &quot;And
I&#39;d be glad to be your girlfriend.&quot;

With that said the two girls lay down in Makoto&#39;s bed holding onto
each other, embracing the feel of the others body against their own.
They kissed once more in the dark and fell asleep looking forward to
tomorrow, for the first time.
