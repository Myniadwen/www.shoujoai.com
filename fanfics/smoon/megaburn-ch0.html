<h1>Megatokyo Burning (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>        Most people have heard alot about it, of course, the battle for 
the city of Megatokyo and in a very real way for the heart of Japan. But 
most people only know the outline, not any of the details. I guess 
that&#39;s why you&#39;re here now, right?

        With a story that&#39;s as big as this one is, they say you should 
start at the beginning. But where, exactly, is that supposed to be? 
Especially when you take into account some of the people that we&#39;re 
dealing with here?

        Should I start off with the fall of a ancient civilization on 
the Moon, the survivors flung through space and time into another era? 
In modern times they took up arms against the forces of darkness, 
protecting all of humanity as the legendary sailor soldiers of love and 
justice along with the people who would come to love them.

        But still, it&#39;s not just their story, and those details don&#39;t 
really help us tell the tale.

        Once upon a time, long, long ago a noble Prince fell from grace, 
pulling his Princess sister down with him. Seeking to regain his lost 
power he manipulated a group of heroic young people to become Duelists, 
and one of them proved to be a greater prince than he ever was, saving 
the Princess and freeing them all.

        They all became involved, too.

        As old as humanity itself, or maybe even much older, the beings 
called Goddesses and Demons watched over humanity, answering our calls 
and then granting us wishes both noble and dark as they competed 
fiercely for our very hearts and souls. They even came to Tokyo itself, 
changing things in ways we&#39;re all still dealing with.

        Their actions were part of our tale too, but still...

        Then there&#39;s the AD Police, at that time the only police force 
that really mattered much in the city. Having evolved beyond simply 
dealing with Boomer crimes, the Advanced Police worked all forms of 
cutting edge crimes, and were the first to begin to see that something 
was going on.

        But they weren&#39;t enough to stop it, not on their own.

        The staff of a private bar, some of the oddest women that you 
would ever think to meet, played a role, too. They took up arms to 
defend their home, to protect people they considered to be their 
friends... And to avenge the death of one of their own.

        Warriors all.

        But what it really came down to, in the end, was the members of 
the Knight Sabers, the four armored defenders of the city. They were the 
ones who finally ended the battle, ultimately, and one of whom paid the 
greatest price.

        Who am I?

        Oh, I didn&#39;t say, did I?

        My name is Nene Romanova.

        And I was there to see it all.

Introduction Notes: Bubblegum Crisis 2055: Megatokyo Burning

This is a continuation of the BGC fanfiction A Goddess Comes to Call, 
and set in the same continuity as the Arisugawa&#39;s Locket/ Eternal City 
Crystal Tokyo series. While knowledge of these fics will be useful, it 
won&#39;t be required, hopefully. Chapter one of this series will go up soon 
after the end of my BGC: Mecha Wars crossover.
