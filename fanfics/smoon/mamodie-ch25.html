He picked the lock and snuck into the apartment, his dark clothes 
blending in with the blackness of night. Searching around, he smiled 
when he heard the snoring coming from the bedroom. He stealthily closed 
the bedroom door, lest his presence be discovered by the figure deep in 
slumber.

He then took out his flashlight and began to search. It had to be here 
somewhere in this pigsty of an apartment, and he was determined to find 
it.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up with a malicious glee. He&#39;d found what he was 
searching for. As he began to look over the pages written in red crayon, 
he began to chuckle. They all thought they were so clever. They all 
thought they had everything made, especially her and his fianc&eacute;e.

Well, twenty-four times was more than enough, thank you very much.

He&#39;d show them. He&#39;d show them all!

Remembering the prologue to chapter six, he smiled viciously as he sat 
at the writer&#39;s desk. As the figure in the bed stirred a bit, he took up 
the crayon and started doing some rewrites...

---Omake Twenty-Five: Michiru Must Die?---

--

There are a lot of people out there who, for one reason or another, want 
to see Haruka and Usagi together, Rei portrayed uncharacteristically as 
a moron, that stuck-up snob Michiru dead, and Mamoru leave to go to a 
South Pacific island somewhere where he&#39;ll be taken care of for the rest 
of his life by big-breasted native women. This story is for them...

--

&quot;Hey guys.&quot; Ami said as a car came to a screeching stop outside the 
Crown, &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot;

&quot;Not much.&quot; Makoto said as a car door slammed shut outside, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;Whoa, hold on.&quot; Rei, who was wearing a dunce cap and a shirt that said 
&quot;Village Idiot&quot; interrupted, &quot;I don&#39;t care if it does break the fourth 
wall rule, something&#39;s wrong here!&quot;

Before Ami could respond, a very angry Haruka burst into the Crown.

&quot;What the hell kind of a script is this?&quot; the angry blonde roared.

&quot;Well...&quot; Ami said timidly, &quot;There are an awful lot of fics dealing with 
you and Usagi...&quot;

At that moment, Usagi walked in with a very unhappy looking Michiru. As 
Michiru and Haruka exchanged glances, Usagi looked at Haruka funny, 
looked quickly at the script she had in her hand, then looked back at 
Haruka.

&quot;Umm... &#39;Oh, Ruka-kun.&#39;&quot; she said, looking visibly uncomfortable, &quot;&#39;I 
love you so much, and...&#39; Okay, look.&quot; she said as she stepped out of 
character, &quot;We all know this is wrong. Ruka, you love Michi-chan, and 
I... I love Rei-chan. Something is horribly wrong with this script!&quot;

&quot;Humph,&quot; Michiru said as she crossed her arms, &quot;I could&#39;ve told you all 
that. Of course, I don&#39;t hear Mamoru-baka complaining.&quot;

&quot;Say,&quot; Rei said suspiciously, &quot;Exactly where is Mamoru?&quot;

------

&quot;This is the life.&quot; Mamoru said as a bubbly native girl handed him a 
drink in a coconut. As one of the attractive native women massaged his 
shoulders another was rubbing his feet. He smiled as he thought of how 
easy it had been. After he found the author&#39;s address, all he had to do 
was sneak in, do a little creative rewriting, and sneak out. Even now, 
he thought as he began to laugh, his plan was working perfectly.

They thought they were so smart, he thought. Let them see how they liked 
it.

Of course, if he had written the script as &quot;Rei Must Die,&quot; they&#39;d 
immediately know it was him. By choosing Michiru, it would throw them 
into confusion and he&#39;d make it through the omake scott free for once. 
And anyways, the prissy little violinist was always taking his parking 
space, so it served her right.

As one of the large breasted native girls started to play her ukulele, 
he sipped from his drink and sighed happily.

------

&quot;Guys.&quot; Ami said, &quot;Look, I agree with you that there&#39;s something 
seriously wrong with all this, but we have to follow the script. We have 
no choice, remember? I...&quot; the genius was cut off as Minako, dressed up 
as Sherlock Holmes, and Setsuna burst into the Crown.

&quot;Have no fear gang, detective Mina&#39;s here!&quot; the blonde declared as she 
held up her magnifying glass triumphantly.

Makoto raised an eyebrow, &quot;Huh?&quot;

&quot;What my girlfriend is trying to say,&quot; Setsuna broke in, &quot;Is that, since 
we&#39;re not scheduled to be in this episode, that gives us an opportunity 
to look into this mess and see what the heck&#39;s going on.&quot;

&quot;Right. What she said.&quot; Minako added.

&quot;Okay.&quot; Ami said, &quot;You two try to sort this mess out. In the meantime, 
we&#39;ll plod our way through this episode.&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan.&quot; Michiru said, a worried look in her eyes, &quot;Please solve 
this before page six.&quot; she said as she held the script tightly in her 
hand. As the artist finished, she felt Haruka&#39;s hand squeeze hers.

Minako nodded gravely, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, leave it to us.&quot;

&quot;We won&#39;t let you die.&quot; Setsuna added, going over to hug the violinist 
just before she left with Minako out the Crown&#39;s exit. Ami then turned 
to the others.

&quot;Okay.&quot; she said, &quot;Let&#39;s trust them and start the Omake.&quot;

......

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Minako asked as they entered the street outside the Crown, 
&quot;What do we do?&quot;

&quot;There are a multitude of realities and timelines out there.&quot; Setsuna 
answered as she opened the timegate, &quot;We have to search through them 
until we find the real author of this series and get him to fix this!&quot; 
and with that, the two entered the portal and disappeared.

------

&quot;And my girlfriend back home doesn&#39;t understand me.&quot; Mamoru said to the 
one native cuddled up in his lap as his back and feet continued to be 
massaged.

&quot;Aw, you poor sweet young man.&quot; The native massaging her shoulders cooed 
as she pressed her ample cleavage into his back, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll 
take care of you.&quot; She purred. Mamoru smiled blissfully as he took 
another sip of his drink.

&quot;I wonder how things are back in Tokyo.&quot; he said as the big breasted 
native in his lap traced his jaw line with her finger.

------

&quot;&#39;Duh...&#39;&quot; Rei said from her chair as she sat under her dunce cap 
drooling onto her village idiot&#39;s shirt.

&quot;&#39;Yes,&#39;&quot; Usagi said as she went over to Haruka, &quot;&#39;Oh, my Ruka-kun, I 
love you so much it makes my guts hurt.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Makes your guts hurt?&quot; Rei asked, &quot;What the hell kind of dialogue is 
that?&quot;

&quot;Fourth wall!&quot; Ami pleaded.

Rei rolled her eyes, &quot;Oh yeah, &#39;duh...&#39;&quot; she said as she went back to 
drooling on herself.

&quot;&#39;Yes, my cute little odango head,&#39;&quot; Haruka said, visibly uncomfortable 
saying the dialogue to the blonde she looked at almost like a little 
sister, &quot;&#39;And I love you too, far more than that stuck-up violinist who 
always looks down on Mamoru and never includes him in any of her 
conversations.&#39;&quot;

&quot;&#39;But my Ruka-kun,&#39;&quot; Michiru said, a worried look in her face as she 
realized what was coming up soon, &quot;&#39;I thought we had something special 
together.&#39;&quot;

Haruka looked into Michiru&#39;s eyes, her mind racing back to when she and 
Michiru were attacked by Eudial. She still shivered when she thought of 
watching her love shot with arrows. Then, there was the time she and 
Michiru were overcome by Galaxia...

&quot;&#39;I...&#39;&quot; the sandy-blonde began, looking from Michiru to the others in 
the room and back, &quot;&#39;I... Love her more.&#39;&quot; Haruka said, anger rising up 
within her at whoever was responsible for this script.

&quot;&#39;Then...&#39;&quot; Michiru said, &quot;&#39;I have no choice but to perform seppuku.&#39;&quot; 
she said, her voice barely above a whisper. As she turned mournfully 
away from Haruka to grab a large knife lying on a table, Makoto got from 
her seat.

&quot;No!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;I can&#39;t just watch this, I...&quot; she was cut off as 
the timegate opened and Setsuna and Minako rushed out, passing out 
papers hurriedly to all their fellow Senshi in the Crown. Everyone 
quickly read the new scripts and a collective sigh of relief was 
released by everyone in the scene.

&quot;&#39;Wait!&#39;&quot; Haruka shouted as she read the new lines, &quot;&#39;Don&#39;t kill 
yourself Michi-chan. For it turns out that Usagi, Rei and I were in a 
car accident that made the three of us temporarily insane. But we&#39;re all 
right now, and back to normal.&#39;&quot;

&quot;&#39;I... I&#39;m so glad.&#39;&quot; Michiru said, trembling slightly as she read the 
line. As she finished, Haruka took the knife away from her aqua-haired 
lover and put it back down on the table. She then hugged the violinist 
close to her.

&quot;&#39;Yes.&#39;&quot; Rei said, smiling as she watched Haruka and Michiru holding one 
another tightly, &quot;&#39;And now that I&#39;m no longer a drooling idiot, and 
Mamoru&#39;s nowhere to be found, I can declare my love for Usagi.&#39;&quot;

&quot;&#39;And I love you too, Rei.&#39;&quot; Usagi said as she went over and kissed the 
raven haired temple maiden on the lips, removing her dunce cap as she 
did so. As the scene now officially came to an end, Haruka turned to the 
blonde in the Sherlock Holmes costume.

&quot;Psst.&quot; the frazzled Senshi of the Air called to Minako as she held 
Michiru&#39;s trembling body close to hers, &quot;What happened, who...&quot;

&quot;It was Mamoru.&quot; Minako said, &quot;He snuck into the author&#39;s apartment late 
at night and rewrote the script. We were also able to learn he&#39;s 
currently lounging around in a South Seas paradise.&quot;

&quot;Care to pay him a visit?&quot; Setsuna asked with a malicious grin as she 
opened the timegate. Both Haruka and Michiru returned the evil smile.

------

&quot;You mean, you saved the world all by yourself?&quot; the native rubbing 
Mamoru&#39;s back asked. Mamoru smiled as he finished off his drink and 
passed it to the girl on his lap, smacking her behind playfully as she 
got up to get him a refill. As the native who was massaging his feet got 
up to help the other, Mamoru smiled pleasantly to himself.

&quot;Well, I had a little bit of help from some girls I know, I... Hmmm?&quot; 
Mamoru asked as he saw a bottle with a message in it floating to the 
shore of the island paradise he was on. He got up to grab the bottle, 
blissfully unaware of the hand reaching around to cover the mouth of the 
young native who had been massaging his shoulders. As he focused on the 
newfound discovery, he sat back down, ignorant of the fact that a 
different set of hands were now massaging his back. As he got the cork 
out of the bottle, he read the simple message.

&quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he asked, &quot;&#39;Dear Mamoru, you&#39;ve been a very naughty boy. 
Look behind you&#39;?&quot; he asked. He turned around, only to jump back in 
shock at seeing the very angry face of Sailor Neptune staring back at 
him.

&quot;Aaaa!&quot; he yelled as he jumped away from the Senshi of the Seas, &quot;Um... 
M... Michi-chan,&quot; he stuttered out nervously as he slowly began to back 
up, &quot;W... W... What a pleasant surprise, I...&quot; he stopped when he backed 
into someone. Whirling around, he found himself face to face with Sailor 
Uranus.

&quot;And... And Ruka too.&quot; he said as he felt a sinking feeling in the pit 
of his stomach. The Senshi of the Air glared angrily at him as she 
crossed her arms in front of her. She then looked over to her love who 
was likewise staring at Mamoru.

&quot;What do you say?&quot; Sailor Uranus asked, &quot;Ten second head start?&quot;

Sailor Neptune shook her head, &quot;Three seconds.&quot; she answered.

&quot;Now, now ladies,&quot; Mamoru pleaded, &quot;I...&quot;

&quot;One.&quot; Sailor Uranus said.

&quot;Let&#39;s not do something we&#39;ll all regret.&quot; Mamoru said as he began to 
back away.

&quot;Two.&quot; Sailor Neptune said.

&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Mamoru cried out as he turned and ran.

&quot;Three... World Shaking!&quot; Uranus yelled.

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; Neptune added.

As the two Senshi looked triumphantly at the battered and bruised dead 
body before them, the timegate reopened and Setsuna emerged, &quot;Ready to 
go?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You bet.&quot; Sailor Uranus said with a smile.

&quot;I haven&#39;t had that much fun in ages.&quot; Sailor Neptune added. As the two 
Senshi walked into the portal Uranus put her arm around Neptune&#39;s 
shoulder, hugging her close to her.
