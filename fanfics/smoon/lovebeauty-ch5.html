<h1>Love and Beauty (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lovebeauty-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Oh my god, Minako-chan...Venus. You are truly the Senshi of Love.&quot; 
Makoto whispered, her hands playing idly in the soft blonde hair. 
Makoto pulled Minako up, onto the sofa, next to her. Makoto let a hand 
trace the line of Minako&#39;s jaw, still damp from her efforts, then 
kissed her friend. Again their tongues met, and this time Makoto could 
taste herself in her lover&#39;s kiss. 

When they broke the kiss, they embraced, skin against skin, for a long 
moment. Minako opened her eyes and very softly, whispered into 
Makoto&#39;s ear. &quot;Mako-chan...my love....&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes opened wide and she looked at this woman before her. Had 
she ever anticipated this? Could she have predicted that this woman 
would love her? Shaking her head internally, she moved to cup Minako&#39;s 
face in her hands. Minako&#39;s hands traced the muscles in her arms.

&quot;So strong....&quot; Minako breathed, as Makoto laid her back once again 
against the cushions. Makoto felt her heart pound in her chest. With 
some urgency she began to strip Minako of her silk stockings. Looking 
up at he blue eyes that regarded her, Makoto was sure she saw an 
interesting glint in them. Looking at the stockings in her hand, she 
quickly grabbed both of Minako&#39;s arms, and binding them together, 
attached them to Minako&#39;s ankles with the strong silk. There was 
plenty of give to the stockings, but Minako was effectively bound. 
Makoto looked up to check for misgiving, but saw only a soft, curving 
smile on Minako&#39;s face. Makoto was shocked by the thrill that ran 
through her body as she realized that Minako had done this before. 
With whom? she immediately wondered, but then her train of thought 
returned to the sight before her.

Now, with both hands, Makoto kneaded Minako&#39;s breasts, watching as the 
blonde arched her back even more than her binding stockings warranted. 
Makoto knew what Minako wanted, and she wanted to give it to her 
but.... Looking around, Makoto searched for something to use.

&quot;So strong...&quot; Minako moaned again. Makoto looked at her hands, then 
at the softly furred mound in front of her. She ran her fingers along 
the cleft between Minako&#39;s legs, until her hand was wet, then slowly 
and carefully, inserted one, then two, then three fingers into Minako. 
The blonde was lost in pleasure, moaning now with every breath. Taking 
a deep breath, Makoto managed to get another finger, then, with some 
careful wiggling, her thumb. Slowly, watching Minako carefully for 
signs of discomfort, Makoto closed her hand and began to move around 
inside Minako. As the blonde moved beneath her, Makoto increased her 
rhythm and depth. Minako was now repeating the word yes with a 
ferocity that surprised Makoto. 

Minako leaned as far forward as she could, and looking right into 
Makoto&#39;s eyes, said, &quot;Yes, oh yes, god, Jupiter fuck me.&quot; And Makoto 
practically came, just sitting there. Now she lost all control, 
realizing that whatever she could give Minako could take. Pounding 
away, she could feel Minako open up to accept her and she could feel 
herself increase her efforts.

In a scream that Makoto was sure would bring the police, Minako raised 
herself up, her neck distended, her head thrashing back and forth, and 
she came. Like nothing Makoto could have ever expected, she could feel 
every muscle, every nerve in Minako&#39;s body thrumming to the rhythm she 
had created. And Minako&#39;s orgasm seemed to last forever, as she took 
more and more of Makoto&#39;s fist.

When, finally, the spasms eased and Minako went to lay back, Makoto 
used one hand to rip the stockings that bound her. Minako stretched 
herself along the sofa, then relaxed, so Makoto could disentangle 
herself. It took a few moments, but eventually her hand reemerged, 
still intact.

Minako drew Makoto on top of her, and pulled her head down, enfolding 
her in soft arms. Makoto let her head rest upon a pillow of Minako&#39;s 
chest and without warning her eyes closed. She listened to the heart 
beneath her pound and felt Minako-chan&#39;s breathing slow and deepen.

After a long, quiet moment. Minako looked down at Makoto and smiled. 

&quot;Thank you...my Jupiter.&quot; 

Makoto lifted her head and met sparkling blues eyes with green ones.

&quot;Thank you, my lovely Venus.&quot;

They continued to lay like that, while their thoughts drifted and 
their bodies rested. Finally, Makoto sat up. She laughed, a little 
embarrassed.

&quot;We&#39;re going to have a heck of a time explaining this to the rest of 
them, you know...&quot;

Minako smiled, lifting an eyebrow. &quot;We&#39;ll just have to find a way to 
get Rei-chan and Ami-chan together.&quot; 

Makoto looked at her lover quizzically. Then she laughed again. &quot;Well, 
if anyone can do it, it would be you!&quot;

Minako looked off into the distance. &quot;I wonder...,&quot; then turned to 
look at Makoto once more. &quot;We can take care of that later. Right now, 
we have other things to take care of.&quot;

Makoto smiled and leaned forward and kissed her. &quot;You are absolutely 
right.&quot;
