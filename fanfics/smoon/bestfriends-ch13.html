<h1>Best Friends (part 13 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The exercise machines at the Sports Center hummed with activity 
as Kenjo finished his cardio work.  When he&#39;d arrived about an 
hour earlier, the place had been mostly deserted, but while he 
worked out, it had started to fill up.  Fortunately, he&#39;d been 
able to reserve the basketball court.   Drying his forehead with 
his towel and draining his water bottle, he headed over to where 
Makoto was stretching out.  

&quot;Well, you all limbered up, Mako-chan?&quot; he asked.  &quot;You&#39;d better 
be.  I&#39;ve gotten better since we last played.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Makoto replied with a grin, &quot;and I hope you didn&#39;t 
expend too much energy on that elliptic thing.  I wouldn&#39;t want 
you to play at anything short of your peak, after all.&quot;

Kenjo extended a hand and pulled Makoto to her feet. &quot;I was just 
getting warmed up.  I could only get us thirty minutes, but that 
should be enough.  Are you ready?&quot;

Nodding curtly, Makoto accompanied him out of the warmup area, 
past the racquetball rooms, to the main gym.  Though the Sports 
Center had a full-length court, complete with bleachers and 
scoreboard for leagues, they would only use half of it.  Tossing 
her sweatpants and sweatshirt onto the stands, she did some final 
stretches while Kenjo got a pair of basketballs from storage.  

Kenjo passed one ball to Makoto and began taking shots from a 
variety of distances with his own.  Makoto followed suit until 
they both felt ready to begin.  

&quot;Ok, we both trust each other, right?&quot; Kenjo asked rhetorically. 
&quot;I&#39;ll track your score.  You track mine.  We have until 10 on the 
dot, so about twenty, twenty-five minutes.&quot;

&quot;Losers start,&quot; Makoto informed him with a nasty smirk. &quot;That 
would be you.&quot;  Kenjo took a ball, checked it to her, and 
dribbled slowly toward the basket.

For the first five minutes of their game, they each took it easy, 
settling for jump shots, not contesting rebounds very much, 
chatting as they played.  

&quot;So, how was your date last night?&quot;  Makoto inquired while 
retrieving the ball after one of Kenjo&#39;s baskets.  

&quot;It was incredible.  Tell you all about it over lunch?&quot; he 
suggested.

&quot;Loser buys?&quot; Makoto countered.  Seeing him nod, she agreed. &quot;Ok, 
then I can tell you about my night over lunch, too.&quot;

&quot;Something interesting happen at work?&quot;

&quot;Sort of, while I was on break.  Interesting isn&#39;t quite the 
word,&quot; Makoto beamed, fading away and hitting a 12 foot shot over 
his outstretched hand.  

Kenjo eyed her appraisingly as he found the ball and dribbled 
back behind half-court.  &quot;I can&#39;t wait to hear this.&quot;   With a 
wink, he gave her a head-fake left and drove to the right, trying 
to get around her for an easy layup, upping the intensity of 
their game a bit.  Makoto bit on the head fake but recovered in 
time to swat his shot away as he went up toward the backboard.  
To the surprise of both of them, the block got a big crowd 
reaction.

&quot;WOOO!  GO MAKO-CHAN!&quot; Usagi yelled loudly.  Over in the stands, 
the young blonde sat alongside Rei.  Usagi had gone so far as to 
bring little pom-poms on sticks, which she now waved furiously.   
Rei simply shook her head sadly.  

As Kenjo fished the ball out of the distant corner where it had 
landed, Makoto moved closer to the bleachers.  &quot;What are you guys 
doing here?!&quot;

&quot;We came to cheer you on, of course!&quot; Usagi explained. &quot;WOOO-
HOOOO, GIMME AN M, GIMME AN A, GIMME...&quot;

&quot;Give me a break!&quot; Rei interrupted.  &quot;We came to watch, Usagi, 
not act like teenagers!  Can&#39;t you ever grow up?!&quot;

As Usagi began to wail and complain that Rei was always so mean 
to her, and also that she wasn&#39;t properly supporting their 
friend, Makoto headed back to the court.   Kenjo greeted her with 
a look of mixed amazement and amusement.  &quot;Brought out a cheering 
section, huh?  That hardly seems fair.  You must have been really 
worried about the game, I guess,&quot; he teased.

&quot;I had no idea,&quot; Makoto answered, shaking her head ruefully as 
Usagi attempted to perform some sort of complicated cheering 
routine that resulted in her falling flat on the floor.  

Kenjo chuckled and once again began play.  While he was more 
amused than anything by Usagi&#39;s antics, and Rei&#39;s reactions to 
them, he did note that the cheers appeared to help Makoto&#39;s game.  
Basking in the applause and shouts of her friends, Makoto reeled 
off 4 straight points, even as Kenjo increased his defensive 
pressure.  Now, they fought for every rebound and drove hard for 
the basket on almost every play.  

Finally, Kenjo broke Makoto&#39;s streak by sinking a pull-up jump 
shot.  This time, however, it was his turn to receive some 
accolades.

&quot;Nice shot!  You can do it!&quot; 

Before he turned, he knew who it was and suddenly his pulse 
quickened, despite its already rapid pace.  Sitting to one side, 
a few rows in front of Usagi and Rei, Minako clapped politely and 
smiled encouragingly.  

&quot;Mina-chan!&quot; Usagi admonished, &quot;How can you root for a boy over 
our friend Mako-chan!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just trying to even the odds, Usagi-chan,&quot; Minako calmly 
pointed out.  She acknowledged a wave from Kenjo with one of her 
own, along with a warm smile.

&quot;As if anyone could ever outscream this meatball head,&quot; Rei 
ruefully noted.  

Minako laughed, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to try.  It&#39;s only fair!&quot;

As Kenjo and Makoto continued their game, Usagi scooted over to 
sit on the bench directly behind Minako, followed quickly by Rei.  
&quot;So, Mina-chan, I take it your date went well last night?&quot;

Minako gave Usagi a knowing look and then called out, &quot;Way to go, 
Kenjo-chan!  Nice steal!&quot;

Usagi and Rei exchanged glances to make sure each had picked up 
on that little development.  Similarly, out on the court, Makoto 
lifted an eyebrow toward Kenjo, a gesture which he returned with 
only a mysterious, happy grin.  

&quot;He seems very nice,&quot; Rei whispered, &quot;I&#39;m so happy for you, Mina-
chan!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, and he has nice legs too,&quot; Usagi noted. &quot;You kissed him, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot;
 
Minako smiled, but didn&#39;t answer, instead remaining focused on 
the game.   

Usagi snickered and said, more loudly, &quot;See, I told you she&#39;d 
kiss him.  You owe me an ice cream tonight!&quot;   Rei snorted, but 
didn&#39;t deny the debt, especially after noticing the blush on 
Minako&#39;s face. 

And so, the game continued.  With Minako quietly cheering him on, 
Kenjo went on a small run to pull back close to even with Makoto.  
Usagi&#39;s cheering had died down as she focused her energies on 
trying to pry information out of an unresponsive Minako.  

&quot;Who&#39;s winning?&quot; a soft voice whispered behind the three women in 
the stands.  Ami, having slid in unnoticed, leaned forward, 
speaking quietly so as not to disturb the game.

&quot;Our Mako-chan, of course!&quot; Usagi declared.  &quot;At least, I think 
she is.  Who&#39;s keeping score, anyway?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re keeping score, meatball head,&quot; Rei explained. &quot;It&#39;s 
pretty close, but actually I think Kenjo-san is pulling ahead.&quot;  

At just that momemt, Kenjo spun around Makoto and sunk another 
layup.  Minako clapped loudly, turning back to beam at her 
friends with pride.  &quot;Hi, Ami-chan!&quot; she greeted her friend. &quot;I 
hope you don&#39;t mind, but I thought Kenjo-chan needed at least a 
little support.&quot;

Ami grinned and moved down to sit beside Minako, in front of Rei 
and Usagi.  &quot;I&#39;m sure that Mako-chan understands, Mina-chan.  She 
wouldn&#39;t want everyone to be cheering for her and no one for her 
friend.&quot;  

Usagi leaned forward, &quot;How did it go yesterday, Ami-chan?  Is 
everything ok?&quot;  Rei added, &quot;Did you let that little bastard have 
it?&quot;

Ami sighed.  &quot;Yes, I dealt with Urawa-san. I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be 
causing any more problems.&quot;   At this news, all three of Ami&#39;s 
friends congratulated her and gave her quick hugs of support.  

&quot;Thank you all, for everything,&quot; Ami told them, voice heavy with 
emotion.  Getting a grip, she turned back toward the court, &quot;Now, 
if you don&#39;t mind, I think I&#39;d like to watch this.&quot;

After a minute or two, with both players trading baskets, Minako 
dropped her head close to Ami&#39;s, speaking in a conspiratorial 
tone, but loud enough for Usagi and Rei to hear.  &quot;So, Ami-chan, 
do you want to make a side bet?&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Ami replied cautiously.

&quot;You know, my boyfriend versus your girlfriend?&quot; Minako 
concluded, enjoying the way Ami&#39;s complexion immediately went 
red. 

While Ami tried to stammer out some sort of reply, Usagi added 
her two cents.  &quot;Hey, Rei, what do you think of that outfit Mako-
chan is wearing?&quot; she asked in a theatrical voice. 

Rei normally tried to rein in those traits of Usagi&#39;s which she 
deemed childish, but the temptation to tease their dear shy 
friend was too great to resist.  &quot;Well, I like the t-shirt, but 
those shorts are awfully short, don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Usagi went on, happy to see Rei playing along 
with her. &quot;If I had long, sexy legs like Mako-chan, I&#39;d make sure 
to show them off as much as I could.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right, her legs really are very long, aren&#39;t they?  And 
quite muscular too, wouldn&#39;t you say Ami-chan?&quot; Rei asked 
innocently.

Ami knew they were trying to get her to blush more, as if that 
was possible, but still, she found herself gazing out onto the 
court.  Makoto&#39;s legs were really quite attractive.  She felt a 
flash of warmth pass over her, sweat beginning to bead on her 
forehead.  

&quot;What about the t-shirt?&quot; Usagi continued.  &quot;It&#39;s a bit loose.  
I&#39;m surprised she&#39;s not bouncing around all over the place.&quot;

&quot;Well, duh, she&#39;s wearing a sports bra, Usagi,&quot; Rei theorized. 
&quot;Probably green, too, if I know Mako-chan.  Don&#39;t you agree, Ami-
chan?&quot;

Visions of Makoto bent over, spooning rice into her bowl, buttons 
straining, soft white skin swelling in front of her made Ami gasp 
briefly.  Makoto&#39;s t-shirt clung to her back with the sweat of a 
hard-fought game and Ami could see her bra strap clearly 
outlined.  She didn&#39;t trust herself enough to try to respond.

&quot;I&#39;ve always envied Mako-chan her perfect breasts.   Nice and 
big, but firm and perky. I wish I had so much up top,&quot; Usagi 
lamented.  

&quot;I&#39;m sure your Mamo-chan wishes you did, too!&quot; Rei teased.  &quot;But 
you&#39;re right, Mako-chan is a beautiful woman.  Someone someday is 
going to be very very lucky to have her.&quot;

Ami nodded silently, completely befuddled by both the teasing and 
her own scandalous thoughts.   Overwhelming desire was not a 
sensation with which Ami was either familiar or comfortable.

Minako put an end to it.  &quot;That&#39;s enough, you two.  The poor 
thing is going to explode.  It&#39;s ok, Ami-chan.  You know we all 
love you and we&#39;re all very happy for the two of you.&quot;

Ami smiled at Minako in relief.  Turning to Usagi and Rei, she 
added shyly, &quot;You&#39;re both right, she is the most beautiful woman 
in the world.&quot;

All three of Ami&#39;s friends sighed &quot;Awwwww&quot; and gave her another 
hug.  As they split up, and Makoto hit a deep shot on the court, 
Ami announced, &quot;I&#39;ll take your bet, Mina-chan.  Your Kenjo seems 
like a good player, but I have faith in my Mako-chan.&quot;  

With a happy, mischievous grin, Minako shouted out, &quot;Kenjo-chan!  
You have to win now; I have a bet on with Mako-chan&#39;s girlfriend!  
If you win, I&#39;ll give you a reward.&quot;

As Makoto blushed over the term &#39;girlfriend&#39;, Kenjo dribbled over 
toward the stands.   He&#39;d suspected that everything had sorted 
itself out based on Makoto&#39;s earlier hints, but the confirmation 
made him almost as happy as he&#39;d been the night before.  Almost.  
&quot;What kind of reward, Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see,&quot; Minako replied coyly.  &quot;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll like it.&quot;  
As Kenjo headed back with his renewed sense of purpose clear on 
his face for all to see, Minako flashed a triumphant smile at 
Ami.

Ami thought for a moment and then returned Minako&#39;s grin with a 
sly smirk of her own.  Standing up, she called, &quot;Mako-chan, when 
you win, you&#39;ll get a prize, too!&quot;  Stunned by her own 
brazenness, Ami sat back down, sincerely hoping Makoto would win 
so she could reward her properly.  True, this wasn&#39;t as an ideal 
a location or situation as Wednesday night had been, but Ami 
didn&#39;t think she could hold out much longer.

Each armed with more than ample motivation, Makoto and Kenjo 
moved into the final minutes of their game with a friendly 
ferocity.  Every possession was hard-fought; every point a 
struggle.   Finally, there were only seconds to go.  Makoto had 
just hit a basket, but there was time for one more possession.  

Kenjo dribbled slowly at the top of the key.  &quot;You&#39;ve been 
tracking both of our scores, right?&quot; he whispered.  Makoto 
confirmed his suspicion with a grin and nod.  &quot;I have too, of 
course.&quot;  She did not seem surprised.  &quot;So, we both know what 
really happened, right?&quot;  Again, Makoto nodded.  &quot;Good.  I think 
we both have earned a reward.&quot;  The light went on in Makoto&#39;s 
eyes as she saw where he was going with this.  &quot;I&#39;m going to make 
this shot, and we&#39;ll have tied.&quot;  She indicated her agreement and 
Kenjo drove left.   

&quot;Five! Four! Three! Two! One!&quot;  Usagi shouted helpfully, watching 
the clock.

Kenjo went up a split second before Makoto could, bouncing the 
ball off the backboard.

&quot;Done!&quot;  Usagi announced, just as the ball fell through the net.  
All four women leapt to their feet, clapping.  

Kenjo and Makoto embraced quickly, grabbed their towels from the 
floor, and dried off as they moved toward the waiting crowd.  Rei 
congratulated both of them as Minako and Ami each moved to stand 
beside their respective champions.  

&quot;Well?!  Who won?!&quot; Usagi demanded.  Both Minako and Ami waited 
expectantly.  

&quot;It was a tie,&quot; Kenjo announced sheepishly. 

&quot;Well, you didn&#39;t lose, and that&#39;s good enough for me,&quot; Minako 
informed him impatiently.  Ignoring the giggles from her friends, 
she spun him to face her and kissed him soundly.  Some time 
later, when they parted, she wrinkled her nose.  &quot;You&#39;re totally 
sweaty and smelly, Kenjo-chan!  You should go shower.&quot;  

Kenjo laughed, pulling the now-protesting Minako close for a 
tight hug.  &quot;I will be all cleaned up when you pick me up 
tonight, I promise.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d better be,&quot; Minako warned, unable to keep up the facade of 
being upset.  She remained comfortably in his arms as she soaked 
in the happy and supportive expressions of her closest friends.

&quot;I guess you deserve your reward, too, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami said in a 
quiet but determined voice.  

Makoto stammered that she hadn&#39;t won and that Ami didn&#39;t really 
have to do anything, but Ami would have none of it.  With a deep 
breath, Ami took Makoto&#39;s hands in her own and stood before her.   
As one, the others stepped away to give them a semblance of 
privacy.  

&quot;There is so much you deserve, my sweet Mako-chan,&quot; Ami 
whispered, &quot;this is just the beginning...&quot;  And as Makoto stared 
at her, stunned, hoping against hope, Ami reached up and placed 
her hands on Makoto&#39;s cheeks, pulling her face down. 

&quot;I love you, Mako-chan,&quot; Ami said. Gently, she pressed her lips 
to Makoto&#39;s.  Makoto&#39;s eyes closed and her head tilted slightly, 
hands sliding around Ami&#39;s waist to pull her close.  Ami&#39;s hands 
ran back into Makoto&#39;s hair, releasing it from its ponytail, and 
lost themselves in its cascades.  Lips parted and tongues met as 
each sought to press closer to the other, as if such a thing were 
possible.  

Finally, and reluctantly, Ami pulled away.  The tears she felt on 
her cheeks were reflected on Makoto&#39;s face.  Turning, she noticed 
that all of her friends, even Kenjo-san, were wiping their eyes.  
Suddenly, she felt Makoto&#39;s arms lock around her waist as she was 
swept up into the air and swung around in a big circle.   She 
struggled to catch her breath and balance as Makoto set her down.  

&quot;Sorry, I might have got a little carried away,&quot; Makoto 
sheepishly admitted. 

&quot;Looks like it was Ami-chan who was getting carried,&quot; Rei pointed 
out, bringing a round of laughter from everyone.  

------

Unnoticed by the group of young people on the court, three 
figures watched from the other corner of the gym.  They waited 
while plans were made, players headed to the showers and 
spectators gathered their things to leave.  Soon, everyone but 
Ami had gone, the latter clearly planning to wait for Makoto to 
return from the locker room.  

&quot;It wasn&#39;t a tie,&quot; Haruka noted placidly.  

&quot;No, but that&#39;s their business.  I think they did the right 
thing.  They&#39;re all so cute,&quot; Michiru replied.  &quot;I don&#39;t know 
enough about that young man, but I think Makoto-chan and Ami-chan 
will be very happy together.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;s all right,&quot; Haruka admitted, &quot;Got a good jump shot anyway.  
He needs to work on his ballhandling.&quot;  Hearing Michiru&#39;s 
exasperated sigh, she chuckled, &quot;They&#39;ll be fine.  We knew they 
would be.&quot;  Turning to the third member of their group, she 
asked, &quot;So, did he get that shot off on time?&quot;

Setsuna smiled cryptically. &quot;Does it matter?&quot; she asked.  

Both Haruka and Michiru laughed.  &quot;No, I guess not,&quot; Haruka said.  
Without further discussion, the three Outer senshi headed home, 
sharing in the general sense of happiness for their friends.
