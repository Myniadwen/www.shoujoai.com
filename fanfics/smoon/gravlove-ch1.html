<h1>Gravity of Love (part 1 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Serena Tsukino smiled as her cousin, Minako Aino walked out of the 
bathroom. She was dressed in one of her new outfits, a black miniskirt, 
knee-length boots and a simple white T-shirt that left her midriff bare. 
How it was different from all her other skimpy outfits, only God knows.

&quot;Cute. Are you wearing it for your next show?&quot;

Minako had accomplished her childhood dream to be a singer only a few 
years ago and took on the stage name &quot;Mina.&quot; She was performing at the 
hit show &quot;Saturday Fever&quot; tomorrow night. The blond shook her head, 
heading towards the bathroom.

&quot;Why not, Minako?&quot; Serena called out in confusion. Her cousin had a 
wonderful body, which she was a bit jealous of to be honest. But then 
again, she was a model before she became a singer.

&quot;Your father.&quot;

Upon hearing that, Serena frowned. What did her father do now?

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;He says it&#39;s bad for his reputation.&quot;

Ken Tsukino did not approve of Minako&#39;s profession. When the blond was a 
model, Ken spoke out strongly against it, saying it would look bad for 
the family. However, everyone, including Serena, knew he care more about 
his own reputation than the family&#39;s.

&quot;Since when have you listened to him?&quot;

Minako chuckled as she walked back out, throwing the outfit onto a chair 
and sitting down on the large bed. The skirt was replaced by baggy 
orange PJ bottoms and the shirt by a tank top.

&quot;You&#39;re right. But he&#39;s been really forceful lately.&quot;

Serena signed, lying down on the bed and staring at the ceiling.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. You know him.&quot;

&quot;I do.&quot;

Her cousin soon lay down on her stomach next to her, grinning.

&quot;Serena,&quot; she began in her trademark mischievous tone. &quot;When was the 
last time you&#39;ve been out?&quot;

The other blond eyed her cousin wearily. Minako was a night owl, the 
type that went out at ten and got home the next day at noon. But Serena 
was as different from Minako as night is room day, partially because of 
her father&#39;s stern riles. But then again, she was the innocent kind of 
adorable and playful while Minako was confident, bold and wild.

&quot;Well, I was out with Mamo-&quot;

Minako groaned and turned onto her back. Mamoru Chiba, famous actor, 
handsome, charming and most importantly Serena&#39;s fianc&eacute;. He was the 
perfect specimen, which is why Serena was thankful she snagged her 
&quot;Mamo-chan&quot; first. It was a difficult task, what with 3 million girls 
chasing after him daily.

&quot;Serena.&quot;

It was the younger blonde&#39;s turn to groan as she sat up, waiting 
patiently for the speech that her superstar cousin has given millions of 
times.

&quot;Serena, you&#39;re 23 years old. I understand that you love Chiba and all 
that shit, but you need to have some fun! I mean, really, you&#39;re going 
to spend the rest of your life with him-&quot;

&quot;-so that&#39;s why I should explore new things while I&#39;m still young and 
have a chance. I know, Nako-chan, you&#39;ve told me MANY times.&quot;

Minako shot Serena an annoyed glare, which her cousin simply laughed at 
and hugged her for.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. This is what I want! I love him.&quot;

The singer rolled her eyes at the dreamy look on Serena&#39;s face. Really, 
the girl was funny, sweet, innocent and way too na&iuml;ve. She just didn&#39;t 
know the life of actors.

&quot;Yes, yes, I know. Either way, I&#39;m taking you out tomorrow after my 
gig.&quot;

Serena looked at Minako hesitantly. She did NOT like the expression on 
the other girl&#39;s face.

&quot;But, your performance is finished at midnight.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. We&#39;ll just go afterwards.

The warning bells went off immediately. So easily said, so casually 
said. But Minako does that all the time! There was no way Ken Tsukino 
would let Serena do that!

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry, I have your dad covered.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Serena croaked out.

&quot;Ami.&quot;

The politician&#39;s daughter looked at her cousin skeptically. Ami Mizuno? 
One of the most brilliant doctors in the city at 24? No way,

&quot;Way, cuz. She&#39;s covering for us!&quot;

&quot;How did you get her to do THAT?!&quot;

Minako winked before turning off the lights.

&quot;That... is a secret.&quot;

 

 

~~*~~*~~*~~

Minako smiled and waved at the reporters waiting outside the studio. 
Flashes were going off left and right, questions flying through the air. 
Gracefully, the singer brushed them off politely as her bodyguards made 
a path for her. She disappeared into a black limo.

&quot;Damn.&quot;

&quot;Watch your language.&quot;

The blond star turned her attention to the speaker. Short blue hair fell 
playfully over even bluer eyes.

&quot;Ames.&quot;

&quot;And I don&#39;t even get a greeting? I&#39;m the one being kidnapped here.&quot;

Minako grinned and looked at her nervous cousin.

&quot;Chill, cuz. We won&#39;t get caught.&quot;

Serena didn&#39;t look at all convinced. Ami smiled at the blonde fondly.

&quot;I&#39;ll fend him off.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not him, it&#39;s the public.&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes. &quot;Me or you?&quot;

&quot;Both.&quot;

The singer sighed and shook her head. &quot;Come on, Sere, you&#39;re 23. There 
are so many years to live, but you&#39;ll never stay young forever.&quot;

&quot;Fine, fine.&quot;

&quot;Good. Jacob, Ami&#39;s house.&quot;

 

 

~^~^~^~^~

Minako walked calmly into the bar, squeezing expertly between the mass 
of swaying bodies pressed against each other. Serena, on the other hand, 
was having a bit more trouble than her graceful cousin. By the time she 
made it to the table where the singer sat, the blond had already been 
kicked, shoved and elbowed several times.

&quot;Mina-chan, why are we here?&quot;

&quot;To get you to have some fun of course.&quot;

Serena sighed softly as a waitress approached.

&quot;What can I get you two beautiful ladies?&quot;

The younger cousin watched as Minako winked flirtatiously and the 
waitress leaned forward, showing off plenty of cleavage. Suddenly, it 
all clicked. Serena looked around, guys dancing together... girls 
grinding against each other...

&quot;Mina, is this a-&quot;

A giggle from the singer silenced the blonde. The superstar flipped her 
waist-length hair over one shoulder while cocking her head slightly to 
the side.

&quot;No, Sere-chan, it&#39;s a bi club.&quot;

A maiden blush appeared on Serena&#39;s cheeks. She&#39;s never been to a bi 
club before. Oh, that&#39;s another thing that Ken Tsukino hated about his 
niece: she is publicly bisexual.

&quot;Your orders?&quot;

Minako smiled and crossed her endless tanned legs. The waitress&#39; eyes 
took in the blonde&#39;s entire body and licked her lips.

&quot;Sorry, doll face, but I&#39;m waiting for Becca.&quot;

The waitress nodded and sighed softly. Without another word, she pushed 
through the crowd to get to another table.

&quot;Who&#39;s Becca?&quot;

Minako leaned towards her cousin. The girl knew what the smile on the 
singer&#39;s lips meant. It was the smile her cousin has on when she finds 
her newest toy, the new &quot;cutie.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s short for Rebecca.&quot;

Blue eyes lit up as the singer focused on the figure behind Serena. Her 
cousin sighed and armed with a sympathetic smile for her cousin&#39;s newest 
obsession, she turned.

The woman was tall, at least by the politician&#39;s daughter&#39;s standards, 
about 5&#39; 7&quot;, which puts her an inch taller than Minako and two inches 
taller than herself. Beautiful black hair flowed like waves down her 
back and brushed against the silky skin of her exposed shoulders. The 
creamy skin gave her the look of a fair skinned princess while Minako 
was a tanned goddess. Serena could see the lean muscles the woman had 
from the black midriff bearing tank top. The full lips that twisted into 
a small smile reminded the blond of plump strawberries of the deepest 
red. There was only one real word to describe Minako&#39;s obsession.

And that was: beautiful.

But what she focused on were the woman&#39;s eyes. Deep pools of violet that 
seemed to turn lavender right before the blonde&#39;s own blue eyes.

&quot;Umm... hi.&quot;

Minako&#39;s laughter washed over Serena as the girl blushed. The waitress, 
Rebecca, smiled and smacked the singer on the head with her pad.

&quot;Shut up, Aino. Stop embarrassing the poor girl.&quot;

The singer&#39;s laughter died down, though her large grin remained. She 
mentioned for the waitress to sit on the empty stool at the table. The 
woman obeyed, her eyes still on Serena.

&quot;So, are you one of A-chan&#39;s new girlfriends?&quot;

The blush on Serena&#39;s face deepened as Minako cracked up again. 
Annoyance was etched into Rebecca&#39;s face, her violet eyes flashing. The 
younger blond didn&#39;t like the way the woman&#39;s whole demeanor darkened 
and spoke up quickly.

&quot;No, I&#39;m her cousin, Serena.&quot;

A light blush tainted the waitress&#39; pale cheeks, though she tried to 
look nonchalant.

&quot;Sorry. I can see the resemblance.&quot;

&quot;Well, duh! Becca, seriously.&quot;

The waitress shot Minako another annoyed look. &quot;I&#39;m sooooo sorry. How am 
I supposed to keep track with you bringing a new guy or girl every five 
minutes?&quot;

It was the singer&#39;s turn to blush while her cousin giggled.

&quot;Shut up, Rebecca!&quot;

The raven-haired woman laughed before looking around the crowded club.

&quot;It&#39;s pretty busy tonight. What can I get you two?&quot;

&quot;A beer.&quot;

Rebecca stared at Minako in plain shock. The blond shrugged.

&quot;I don&#39;t feel like vodka or scotch tonight.&quot;

&quot;All right. What&#39;ll you have?&quot;

Serena blinked. This was what? The second time she&#39;s been to a bar?

&quot;Err... a coke please.&quot;

Minako gave her cousin an exasperated look. Rebecca was obviously 
surprised, but nodded and started to walk to the bar.

&quot;Actually, make that a beer.&quot;

Becca turned around, looking at Serena for a minute as if not grasping 
what she just said. Then, a smile appeared on her face and she nodded 
before disappearing into a crowd.

&quot;Are you sure you can handle it?&quot;

Serena glared at her cousin. All right, so her tolerance wasn&#39;t as high 
as the 24 year old&#39;s but it wasn&#39;t THAT bad. Was it?

&quot;Sere, they have strong stuff here, not the light stuff you&#39;re used to.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s glare darkened, though she hesitated slightly. That was a 
very good point.

&quot;Here you go, ladies.&quot;

Two bottles of beer were placed on the table. Becca sat down on the 
stool besides Serena, pulling her long hair into a high ponytail. Minako 
gave her a suggestive smile and picked up the glass bottle. The singer 
brought it to her lips, tilting her head back to show off her long and 
graceful neck. Serena watched as Rebecca&#39;s eyes drank in her cousin&#39;s 
appearance hungrily.

Just then, a drop of beer trailed from Minako&#39;s red lips down to her 
chin and then followed the curve of the singer&#39;s neck. She smiled 
seductively, though managing to still keep on an &quot;innocent&quot; face.

&quot;Oops, I seem to be a little clumsy tonight. I better wipe that off.&quot;

With that, a slender hand reached up to wipe the drop away before it 
stained the singer&#39;s black tube top. Serena watched Rebecca lean 
forward. Violet eyes were dark with lust as her tongue dated forth from 
her ruby lips and licked away the drop of beer. Only, she didn&#39;t stop 
there. Minako smiled and closed her eyes as the raven-haired waitress 
trailed kisses up her neck and her chin. However, Rebecca stopped before 
she reached the singer&#39;s lips.

Serena felt something flutter as Rebecca pulled away smirking and Minako 
open her eyes, clearly disappointed. For once, despite the pleasure her 
cousin obviously got, the blonde seemed upset.

&quot;You always do that. You lead me on then stop.&quot;

Becca shrugged and casually took a drink from Minako&#39;s beer. The singer 
gazed at the waitress almost angrily, but kept her cook as she turned to 
Serena.

&quot;Are you sure you don&#39;t want a soda instead?&quot;

Her cousin looked worriedly at the beer bottle in the younger girl&#39;s 
hands. Serena wearily noted that the beer was now probably warm since 
she&#39;s been cradling it all this time.

&quot;No, it&#39;s fine,&quot; Serena replied, trying to act casual though it failed 
miserably.

&quot;Positive?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Mina. Leave her be. She can&#39;t be under your protection all the 
time.&quot;

The blonde idol shot a dark glare at the waitress. Becca shrugged 
casually and played with her raven ponytail.

&quot;She&#39;s been under my wing since we&#39;ve were babies. Soon, she&#39;ll be under 
her husband&#39;s care.&quot;

Rebecca was shocked, though it barely registered on her face. Serena 
realized it seems as if nothing affected the waitress much. Suddenly, 
she found herself staring into the most amazing violet eyes she&#39;s ever 
seen.

&quot;Serious?&quot;

Serena blushed slightly and looked down at her lap. She didn&#39;t know why, 
but she feels so nervous around her cousin&#39;s desired. Must be because 
she&#39;s a stranger. Yeah, that&#39;s it.

&quot;Yes.&quot;

Becca leaned forward, her expression dark. A shiver went through Serena. 
Was it fear? Or perhaps excitement? Rebecca was so mysterious, so dark, 
so unlike Minako. From her appearance to her attitude, the waitress 
seemed to radiate a sense of danger.

&quot;How old are you? Minako&#39;s 24, so you have to younger.&quot;

The blond being questioned flipped her blond hair over her shoulder, a 
nervous habit she&#39;d had since she was young. Looking at her cousin, she 
saw a jealous gleam in the abnormally wild eyes. Serena shuddered and 
looked away.

&quot;I&#39;m 23.&quot;

&quot;And already getting married?&quot;

A nod. Becca took another sip from Minako&#39;s bottle.

&quot;Wow, I can&#39;t imagine doing that when I&#39;m 23.&quot;

Serena did a double take and looked at the woman with confused cerulean 
eyes.

&quot;How old are you?&quot;

Becca gave her a teasing smirk. &quot;Now how mysterious would I be if I told 
you?&quot;

Minako snorted and winked at Serena. &quot;Mysterious my ass. She&#39;s 21.&quot;

Becca glared angrily at the singer. The blond simply smiled innocently 
and batted her eyelashes. The waitress groaned softly and shook her head 
in defeat.

&quot;Damn fluffy idiot.&quot;

Minako winked at Rebecca and sipped Serena&#39;s beer. The blonde star 
stood, tossing her leather jacket onto the table.

&quot;Let&#39;s dance!&quot;

The waitress shook her head. &quot;Not tonight. I&#39;m exhausted. I was just 
about to go home when I spotted you.&quot;

Minako pouted and tugged on Rebecca&#39;s hand. The dark-haired woman shook 
her head again.

&quot;Sorry, A-chan. I&#39;m really tired. Next time, I promise.&quot;

The star pouted but relented none the less. She turned her gaze towards 
Serena and smiled.

&quot;Come on, Sere.&quot;

The younger girl nodded and hesitantly slid off of the stool. A hand 
suddenly grabbed her wrist. Serena turned, shocked to find the smooth 
but grim hand&#39;s owner staring intently into her eyes.

&quot;I have to talk to you.&quot;

Serena nodded numbly, vaguely aware of the jealous and annoyed 
expression on her cousin&#39;s face. Upon seeing it, Becca&#39;s free hand shot 
out and grabbed the singer&#39;s hand. With a strong tug, Minako was pulled 
to the violet-eyed woman&#39;s chest. Without warning, Becca&#39;s lips claimed 
the singer&#39;s.

Becca&#39;s hand slipped from Serena&#39;s wrist. The blonde felt strangely 
aware of the lack of warmth on her skin. Her cousin&#39;s hands ran through 
the waitress&#39; silky looking hair as the other kept her arms around 
Minako&#39;s waist. Eventually, they pulled away. For the first time, Serena 
saw that her cousin was breathless and dazed after a kissed. A smug 
little smirk rested on Becca&#39;s red lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t be jealous.&quot;

&quot;Jealous? Who? Me?&quot;

Rebecca rolled her eyes at the innocent look on the blonde&#39;s face. With 
a slap on the waitress&#39; ass, Minako was gone.

The woman then turned her attention to the other blond. Serena felt 
unnerved at the waitress&#39; stare, but tired not to let it show. That drew 
an amused smile from the violet-eyed woman.

&quot;So, what did you want to talk about?&quot;

Becca&#39;s smile grew at Serena&#39;s attempt to sound nonchalant. &quot;Just to see 
if you can do me a favor.&quot;

Serena stiffened. A favor. She should&#39;ve seen that one coming. Ever 
since Ken Tsukino became the major, everyone needed a favor.

&quot;Oh, nothing political of anything,&quot; Becca added quickly. &quot;Just some 
questions about Minako. I&#39;m serious about your cousin and I figured I 
could use your advice.

Serena nodded calmly. All right, she explained herself just in time. It 
was about Mina-chan.

&quot;All right.&quot;

&quot;Can we meet tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Serena hesitated. She spoke after a few seconds of silence. 
&quot;From three in the afternoon I&#39;m free.&quot;

&quot;Good. I get off my other job at four. So, do you mind if we meet for 
coffee or something at five?&quot;

Serena was amazed to know that Becca held two jobs. Then again, she&#39;s 
never lacked money. Or anything for that matter.

&quot;Sure. Where?&quot;

&quot;Umm... Jazz Club?&quot;

&quot;Okay. Four?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. Thanks.&quot;

&quot;No problem.&quot;

Rebecca stood, flinging a trench coat over her outfit. Serena smiled and 
rushed onto the dance floor to find Minako. However, she did catch 
Rebecca&#39;s smile. And something just wasn&#39;t right

 

 

 

~*~*~*~*~*~

Hey. This, is a Rei/Usagi fic. She&#39;ll be referred to as Serena for 
reasons that was explained in this chapter. The first chapter was 
boring, I admit. It&#39;ll get better though! Or at least I hope...
