Hiya, minna-san,

this is Hotaru, summarizing this entry. This one is all around 
Minako&#39;s 16 birthday and what a birthday it was... An emotional 
roller coaster all along, especially for Minako and me but the others 
as well.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
Birthdays among Senshi... as few as we actually had, followed a basic 
principle. At the head of organization would be a pending triumvirate 
of Minako, Rei and me. Plans would be made between us, tasks given 
and schedules made. Makoto would provide the food of course and Ami 
would help where she could, not to mention keep an eye on costs and 
that everything looked just right - she had an eye for such things, 
even without using that computer of hers.
	Now, the 21st of October was no different in the usually come 
and go, the hectic of the day before a birthday, the last bits of 
preparations... There were a few differences though. Since Minako was 
the lucky one, she couldn&#39;t be planning her own party of course. Not 
that it would be much of a surprise. Being one of the head party 
girls herself she knew all too well the routine. No, it was of course 
simply a tradition that you would pretend the honor guest would be 
totally surprised... and the honor guest had to play surprised anyway.
	The next difference was that Rei was in a particular foul 
mood lately, especially since the disaster with the Aura Knights. We 
all were actually. Rei had claimed that her presence at the studio - 
so far away from the Jinja - was merely a coincidence and that she 
had made some errands in the area... I wasn&#39;t one to press, not with 
her mood at the moment, but I could not help but to doubt the 
explanation. Strangely enough it was Minako who was covering for her 
story the most... Since I hadn&#39;t been there myself, I would refrain 
from passing judgment. However, Ami and Makoto seemed to share an at 
least basic doubt about the whole thing.
	And as conclusion to all that, I had practically been taking 
care of preparations myself most of the time. Rei was away often and 
we couldn&#39;t ask Minako after all. And I did miss their help and 
competence in this. Rei was very resourceful when it got to 
organizing an event and Minako had just the knack for the right thing 
to add here and there. Be it as simple as the single red balloon 
everyone had forgotten to hang up somehow, or as crazy as the 
exploding flower filled with confetti she had unleashed on Makoto. 
The only real birthday all five of us had celebrated together before 
heading out for D-Point. We had a few other parties in-between but 
that one held a fond memory for all of us. This would be the second 
birthday all of us could celebrate together and I wanted it to be as 
wonderful as possible.
	&quot;I think this should take care of most of the setups,&quot; 
someone commented next to me. That someone had been surprisingly a 
great help... Well, not so surprisingly actually since it was in her 
best interest to make the party worthy for her girlfriend. Hotaru had 
proved to be rather innovative once unleashed from her chains of 
insecurity and shyness. After some initial caution and insecurity, 
Hotaru had been right in the midst of planning and executing in no 
time. Rei, for some reasons, hadn&#39;t commented at all, the few times 
she was actually present. She only shot the younger girl some weird, 
almost thoughtful looks.
	I looked around at the decorated inside of the Jinja - or at 
least the room we had chosen as the main party room. Rei had 
protested at first against &quot;misusing&quot; her home and complained about a 
further lack of privacy but had quickly relented after  we pointed 
out that we were practically here most of the time anyway. And, point 
in fact, Rei was strangely absent from her own home a lot the days 
between the Aura Knight battle and Minako&#39;s birthday. In this period 
of time we had managed quite a bit under the combined efforts of 
everyone else. It wasn&#39;t as if Rei wasn&#39;t trying to help when she 
could. The problem was, most of the time she was incapable of doing 
so, because of simple absence.
	&quot;I think you are right,&quot; I mused, letting my gaze wander 
around the room one more time. Over the table with gifts, the 
decoration of a rather intriguing design, courtesy of Hotaru, that 
even Rei seemed to be impressed with. Bound together above the 
entrance of the room and stretching around the room, were bands of 
gold, with tiny heart shapes combined with the outlines of the 
western astrological symbol of Libra. There was also a cross-like 
shape right in the middle above the entrance that symbolized the 
Venus Tear in battle mode. Makoto had insisted on adding a small 
picture she had taken recently of Minako and Hotaru. It showed the 
blonde with her arms around Hotaru and chin resting on the black-
haired girl shoulders. Hotaru had been heavily protesting, saying 
that this was supposed to be for Minako alone but Mako-chan had been 
relentless. It was sort of meant as a welcoming gesture as well, and 
I think the younger girl could need it.
	&quot;What do you think, Rei? Anything to add?&quot; Makoto asked, 
coming up behind us with an apron and a bit... untidy. Makoto was 
still working on that cake but had promised it would be ready by 
tomorrow.
	Rei putting up a last band turned around and gave the effort 
of a smile. &quot;I think it&#39;s quite nice. A miracle, I say, since our 
Odango Atama planned most of it.&quot; I fixed the other girl with a glare 
who just shrugged in response.
	&quot;I&#39;m not incompetent you know, Rei-chan? Besides, I had quite 
inspiring help from someone other than you,&quot; I shot back, crossed my 
arms and pointedly ignored her, as I smiled at Hotaru who blushed a 
little. &quot;Arigato, Hotaru-chan, I don&#39;t think we could have done it 
without you... Especially since some of us are blissfully absent most 
of the time.&quot;
	Makoto laughed at that and Ami hid a smile. &quot;She got you 
there, Rei. And I must admit I was surprised how well you managed 
too, Hotaru-chan,&quot; the tall brunette commented, rewarding Hotaru with 
a friendly smile. Rei didn&#39;t say anything. She just glowered.
	Ami looked out of the window. &quot;It&#39;s getting dark already. I 
think we should get back home since training is cancelled for today. 
Our families are worrying enough already,&quot; she said. That was true, 
even though it mostly was meant for me - since the others didn&#39;t have 
to worry about parents so much - but even Ami had gotten a few calls 
from her mother who was simply worried.
	I took one last look at the room and nodded, before a yawn 
escaped my mouth. It had been tiring to pull this off in-between all 
the stress our lives were under in the last two weeks but there had 
simply been not an argument whether or not we would wait with a party 
until everything had calmed down. Tempers were flaring and everyone&#39;s 
nerves were on edge anyway. The mood wasn&#39;t the best. The group 
needed this. No one was going to argue with that and no one had.
	&quot;Alright. Let&#39;s head home, everyone. I think Minako must be 
missing Hotaru already.&quot; Hotaru flushed scarlet under Makoto&#39;s laugh 
and Ami&#39;s quiet giggles. Artemis just smirked and Luna smiled 
slightly. Rei didn&#39;t express any humor at the comment but I could see 
a slight twinkle in her eyes... of course, it could have been my 
imagination.
	Shortly afterwards everyone had separated to head their 
individual ways home.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(First gong)
Scene fades up on the surface of a hilly land, covered with vivid 
green grass and a field of flowers. We see Usagi standing in the 
center in her princess gown but without the Crescent Moon sigil, 
Mamoru is standing off to the side in a black suit, watching her with 
a quiet smile.

(Second gong)
The camera swings around, capturing Minako and Hotaru sitting and 
leaning against each other in the flower field. Minako has an arm 
around Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and Hotaru&#39;s head is on her right shoulder, 
their fingers interlocked and eyes half-closed.

(Third gong)
The camera swings yet again towards Ami, Rei and Makoto a short 
distance away from the couples, enjoying the weather. Ami against a 
tree, reading, Rei dozing off in the sun and Makoto, chasing Artemis 
for some reason, while Luna sits nearby shaking her head.
(First notes up to lyrics)
The scene fades black shortly and then shows Usagi/Serenity rising 
into the sky, transforming into Sailormoon in the process, Tuxedo 
Kamen right beside her. The familiar shape of the Moon comes into 
view and the surface draws closer as the pair descend, showing the 
ruins of the fallen Moon Kingdom. Mercury, Mars and Jupiter join them 
shortly, as does Venus without Hotaru, Luna and Artemis to their 
respective partner&#39;s feet. The season logo is slowly drawn over the 
assembled senshi.

(Gomen ne sunao janakute)
(Yume no naka nara ieru)
(Shikou kairo wa shooto sunzen)
(Ima sugu aitai yo)
                       
We see Ami with a book in her hand walking down a street, before she 
looks and turns around to face the screen. The sign of Mercury 
flashes on her forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a 
translucent image of Sailormercury.
Rei can be seen with her back to the screen, working on something at 
the Jinja. Phobos and Deimos fly into the scene and perch upon Rei&#39;s 
shoulders. The miko turns around and the sign of Mars flashes on her 
forehead and her form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image 
of Sailormars.
Makoto can be seen working out, her motions flowing flawlessly into 
each other. She suddenly halts in mid-motion and turns her head to 
face the camera. The sign of Jupiter flashes on her forehead and her 
form is momentarily overlaid by a translucent image of Sailorjupiter.

(Nakitaku naru you na moonlight)
(Denwa mo dekinai midnight)
(Datte junjou doushiyou)
(Haato wa mangekyou)

Minako can be seen with jogging clothes, running down a street, sweat 
pouring from her forehead. She comes closer and the scene is suddenly 
frozen with a close-up on Minako, the sign of Venus on her forehead 
and the translucent layer of her senshi identity. The screen splits, 
leaving Minako frozen in place and showing now Hotaru in her room, 
lit by various candles and lamps, kneeling in a circle of the former. 
Her hair is hanging down and half-covers the concentration on her 
face. Suddenly darkness engulfs the room as well as Minako in the 
other scene. Hotaru desperately reaches out towards the other. For a 
moment her eyes turn blank and emotionless, the sign of Saturn 
flashes briefly on her forehead and her form is overlaid by the 
translucent image of Sailorsaturn, before everything turns black.

(Tsuki no hikari ni michibikare)
(Nando mo meguriau)

A group of four shadows becomes more detailed on the background of 
darkness. A brown-blond haired man, a light blue-haired one, a dark 
haired, very tall and heavy man and a redheaded pig-tailed one that 
looked remarkably female. A &quot;shadow&quot; can be seen looming over the 
four like a cloak covering a head.
Two points of light suddenly disrupt the darkness. On the left, the 
Silver Crystal can be seen and on the right the Venus Tear. A thin 
line of violet slashes through the middle of the screen and shows 
Serenity and Endymion on the left side, Saturn and Venus on the 
right. Serenity holds the Silver Crystal high into the air, while 
Endymion supports her with one arm, the other on the sword hilt. 
Venus has the Venus Tear in both hands and Saturn swings the Silence 
Glaive a few times for emphasis.

A brief flash shows Sailorpluto at the Time Gate looking worriedly 
upon the scene.
                       
(Seiza no matataki kazoe uranau koi no yukue)
(Onaji kuni ni umareta no)
(Mirakuru romansu)

Scene shifts to the Moon once again. Among the ruins, a large, black 
structure can be seen, vaguely resembling a military base. The scene 
shows the Senshi again, running side by side on the surface of the 
Moon, being assaulted by various Youma and other things... The 
Princess&#39;s guard jumps into the air, Mercury sending a stream of 
water and Jupiter a barrage of lightning combined into the enemy 
rows, Mars ignites a few more and Venus slashes through several 
opponents with a four-bladed, cross-like weapon out of pure 
crystalline light.
The scene shifts to an image of the Moon again, hanging loosely in 
black space. A blue, red and green star appears to the left, an 
orange and violet one to the right. In the middle, a bright silver 
and golden star joins the others. The stars are transformed into the 
Inner Senshi, Moon, Tuxedo Kamen and Hotaru, standing beside Venus on 
the right, a translucent image of Saturn hovering over her. The image 
of the intact Moon Palace is added to the background. Pluto appears 
above the group with the Time Staff raised; the Garnet Orb flashes a 
bright crimson and the scene freezes.

(Ami)
The last sunrays sparkled on the horizon, bathing the world in a 
beautiful display of color that was the cause for so many romantics 
and poets. Some found the color of sunset to be a crimson-red, almost 
like blood. Some said it was more an orange-red, a deep gold maybe... 
There were so many descriptions. Of course, I could probably 
determine the color of the sunset right now down to the last nuance 
of red. However, I would not spoil myself the fun.
	Closing the notebook I closed my eyes for a moment and 
breathed in the scent of the late evening that was just about now 
breaching into night. The Autumn air was clean and fresh, a little 
cold this time of day maybe but not overly uncomfortable. None of the 
others knew about my secret hobby of poetry. I didn&#39;t believe it to 
be much good, anyway, but it was only a question of time before 
someone - especially Makoto right now - would stumble over it. I saw 
it more as a method of relaxing instead of a hobby. Something 
abstract compared to the logical, maybe a leftover trait from my 
father that had developed only recently. It helped to keep me 
reminded of the beauty and chaos of the world instead of just the 
order of numbers and characters...
	I looked over my shoulder to see if Makoto was coming but 
didn&#39;t spot the brunette. She wanted to see to it that the birthday 
cake was flawless, and discussing culinary perfection with Makoto was 
a waste of time, especially when you had a slightly different 
opinion. Instead of my host I saw Rei at the side of the Jinja. She 
was almost out of view and, if one hadn&#39;t specifically looked in that 
direction, would have been hard to spot. Making sure once more that 
Makoto wasn&#39;t coming yet, I made my way over to the miko.
	There was hardly any sound at this hour. The main street down 
the stairs in front of the Jinja once in awhile sported a bus or a 
couple of cars. Begin and end of school was where the most traffic 
was in this area of Azabu-Juuban. And so, there was hardly any sound 
other than the occasional chirping of birds that hadn&#39;t went to take 
their own rest already. Neither Rei or I talked, neither of us really 
felt a need to.
	Yes, I did have my suspicious as everyone else did but while 
Rei might be able to fool everyone else, I wasn&#39;t the brain among our 
group for nothing, not to mention that I had just the right personal 
experience to guess what was going on. If not in detail, then at 
least in theory.
	&quot;Not an easy decision, is it? You would think so, but 
actually making it...&quot; I let the words trail off. Rei hadn&#39;t 
acknowledged my presence other than a slight shift in position. It 
didn&#39;t really bother me. &quot;But is it really so hard at the same time?&quot; 
I mused gently, not really asking but voicing my thoughts aloud. &quot;You 
know, it wouldn&#39;t matter what we say, just what your heart tells you.&quot;
	Rei gave a low chuckle. &quot;And that from you.&quot; I hid a smile 
but kept silent otherwise. A cluster of birds flew out of the tree 
alerted by the sudden shriek of one of Rei&#39;s ravens - I could still 
not tell the difference - as he had a slight misunderstanding with 
his kindred over one thing or another. Rei sighed. &quot;How did you 
guess?&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m not really sure if it is much a guess or more a hunch, 
based on recent personal experience,&quot; I replied, tugging on the rim 
of my blouse under the jacket, a sudden chill went over my body as a 
cold breeze passed by.
	&quot;Oh,&quot; Rei stated and fell silent for a few moments. &quot;I guess 
saying you could have told us would be hypocritical?&quot;
	&quot;What makes you hesitate?&quot; I countered. &quot;Is it just the whole 
thing with Minako and Hotaru getting on your nerves? I know you are a 
prideful person, Rei, but I had always the impression that you cared 
enough for us to not hide such important things from the others.&quot;
	&quot;There never would have been a decision to make if I knew who 
and what I was at that time. I suppose you know the feeling - even 
when we were still asleep - that held us here, that told us of 
something more important was waiting for us?&quot; I nodded, all too 
familiar with the feeling. &quot;And yes, I am prideful. I admit to that. 
And maybe that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t listen. And now... Now it is hard to 
just say no. There might never be a better chance. Declining in this 
field is like admitting defeat as good as your reasons might be... 
And I can&#39;t even name them officially.&quot;
	A dilemma, clearly. I would not wish to trade. For me, I had 
always other options. Doctors were needed everywhere and could study 
everywhere. Tokyo wasn&#39;t as bad a place as you might think. In Rei&#39;s 
case though... &quot;And still... Does it really change things?&quot; I 
inquired, knowing on a conscious level what was going on inside the 
miko.
	Rei finally turned to me and shrugged. &quot;I guess not. I made 
my vow lifetimes ago and I renewed it at D-Point as I took the last 
DD Girls with me...&quot; There was pain in her eyes and it must have been 
mirrored in mine. Those memories were amongst the heaviest and most 
gruesome of our young life, for all of us. &quot;I will not leave her. I 
suppose I&#39;m just curious and nervous at the same time, if there had 
been a chance...&quot; The miko fell silent and turned back, her gaze 
again lost somewhere else when the courtyard of the Jinja.
	There wasn&#39;t really anything to add. We had both said what we 
wanted to say. And while I still only had a guess I was a bit smarter 
today about Rei&#39;s problem. It was one of her problems and the others 
helped to actually make it one, yet it had been the problem I was 
most familiar with at the moment. If I had managed to help in some 
way, all the better. Hopefully tomorrow would help to relax her a 
little more.
	I had stopped my return to the front entrance to look back at 
the miko for awhile, seemingly lost in thought sitting on the porch 
that went all around the shrine. Therefore I jumped slightly as I 
felt a hand on my shoulder. I turned and saw that it was Makoto who 
had unbeknownst to me stepped up behind me. &quot;How is she?&quot; There was 
genuine concern in the brunette&#39;s voice and that wasn&#39;t all so 
surprising. Her and Rei tended to clash sometimes because they were 
rather similar, both very prideful in what they were doing. But 
Makoto had a soft spot for her friends and would often act the part 
of a big sister, protective and caring. Her recent training had 
brought that aspect a little bit more to the forefront.
	&quot;She&#39;ll manage,&quot; I answered quietly. &quot;On her own, as always.&quot;
	Makoto snorted. &quot;Stubborn, but I suppose that is Rei for you.&quot;
	I turned around and walked past Makoto. &quot;Oh, I know someone 
else who can get pretty stubborn. We were supposed to be gone half an 
hour ago.&quot;
	Makoto gave an exclamation of protest as she followed me down 
the stairs but she was grinning and I wasn&#39;t hiding the small smile. 
Both of us were quickly getting used to each other. And Makoto would 
leave no opportunity unused to prompt me to act a little bit more 
open, a little less shy. I had found it easy to fall back in the 
strong friendship that had developed between us ever since the taller 
girl joined our team. We had sort of become good friends immediately. 
Sharing an apartment did help to strengthen that bond.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Priapos)
From my vantage point across the street, on the roof of the house 
there, I had a wonderful look into Minako&#39;s room. It was late at 
night already and both younger inhabitants of Aino-ke were sound 
asleep, both in anticipation of the big day. They were sleeping 
rather close together under the covers as well, but that was nothing 
unusually. My sister&#39;s parents would probably just think it cute and 
shrug it off as two girls being close friends... A term more true 
than they might think.
	Minako had been half asleep already when Hotaru had returned 
home. Of course both knew where the other was. I suppose I had been a 
little extra eager in training for this evening. But Minako had been 
restless with Hotaru away so often to plan her party, as well as her 
parents return, that she needed a different outlet. Not that I would 
complain, I loved a good all-out spar as much as my sister.
	It was with a little sadness that I found myself here, unable 
to muster the strength to return home to the small apartment I had... 
acquired for myself. The last days before Minako&#39;s parents came home 
were often spent in the company of the two girls, my family, and I 
had finally allowed myself to settle down a bit. Youma activity had 
surprisingly decreased dramatically. Obviously the loss of both Aura 
Knights had hit them harder than expected. None of us was 
complaining. It left the three of us more time together.
	However, even with the Ainos coming home later than expected, 
staying wasn&#39;t an option right now. There was no way we could explain 
the blood bonds between Minako and myself to the clueless adults and 
right now neither of us wanted to take any chances. I felt myself 
missing the constant presence of the two girls.
	At the same time I had found some distraction in the company 
of Osaka Naru, a fact my kin sister was teasing me about endlessly. 
She was steadfastly implying that the way I talked about the other 
redhead looked like I had a crush on her or something. Ah huh... 
Yeah, sure... Topic closed, no discussion held today.
	Besides that, Naru was pleasant company, even if the original 
source for her interest in me was a more sadder topic. Her boyfriend, 
Umino, and Naru herself sort of had noticed certain differences and a 
gap building between them and she wasn&#39;t so certain anymore if they 
just hadn&#39;t misjudged good friendship for more. Of course, Umino was 
heavily devoted to Naru and telling him this or talking about it 
seriously was close to impossible. Usagi, Naru&#39;s best friend, was too 
occupied right now and somehow I had gotten in the mix as a neutral 
observer...
	Not that I didn&#39;t have some counseling skill. That was one 
thing growing up with Hebe at court had taught me very well. I had 
managed to give Naru some advice on how to try and talk to the boy 
without getting him worried immediately. We were still waiting for 
results though...
	Naru was a nice girl and easy to talk to. She wouldn&#39;t press 
for tricky topics or ask uncomfortable question and if then only in a 
teasing manner I could very well compete with and enjoy. Her remark 
aside, Minako had been happy that I was making friends outside the 
Senshi, even if it was coming close to them, and had actually 
encouraged me to spend more time with the other girl. I could never 
quite wipe out that sly smile on her face... I swear that girl will 
be the death of me one day.
	Yawning, I stretched my tired body for a moment and flapped 
my wings to get back a little feeling into them. Then, with a last 
glance back at Aino-ke, I took off towards my own home, opting to 
make one short round around the neighborhood. I passed over Tsukino-
ke briefly. The repairs had gone of smoothly as had the cover story. 
None of the three other Tsukinos suspected anything about their 
daughter, boyfriend or myself. A small part of me had feared that the 
meddling Time Senshi had altered a little more than just that 
particular memory but she had held true to her word. If anything, the 
whole encounter left a positive side effect. The acceptance of Mamoru 
from both adults. Their fuzzy memories seemed not to have lost the 
actions of protectiveness from the Prince towards their daughter.
	Everything seemed quite in the house, Usagi should be long 
home by now. It was a school day after all tomorrow and finals were 
in spite of everything still a serious topic for the girls. The party 
would be in the afternoon and would hopefully give everyone time to 
prepare... Granted that there wasn&#39;t a Youma or other interruption 
which, to be honest, I had a hard time holding my hopes up for.
	I changed course and was almost back home in another two 
minutes. Immediately my sharp, elf eyes noted the figure on the roof 
of the tall apartment complex and it took even less time to identify 
him as one of my kin. Hair a silvery-white the other elf was bearing 
much greater age and wisdom. No warrior, but experience and wisdom 
was a skill I was drilled to never underestimate. I knew now who it 
was. The head of the elves I had taken from Venus to scout for and 
into enemy territory this summer after Adonis&#39; defeat.
	I landed gently on the roof, managing a small bow in my tired 
state. &quot;I greet you, Asara-dono. What brings you here, at this time?&quot;
	The other elf smiled apologetically. &quot;I am truly sorry about 
the lateness of the hour. Long travels are seldom predictable and I 
am not getting younger. I believe though that the information I bring 
might be useful...&quot; Asara, High Elf, Priest of Ateria, the essence 
and harmony of life and death, made his report and it was disturbing, 
that much can be said. Given, a lot of the information was 
speculation as well, theories, bits and pieces gathered from the 
reports of the spies. But I knew that Asara was one of the best in 
his field, one of the very few elves that had survived in the pocket 
dimension on Venus from the Silver Millennium until today.
	After about ten minutes I watched with a much heavier heart 
and more worries to add to the already existing ones as the older elf 
raced off into the night sky again. It seemed sleep would have to 
wait. Not that I couldn&#39;t manage but I had wanted to be fit for 
tomorrow... Luna and Artemis needed to be informed about this though 
and I wanted to make sure that the warning Asara had given me 
wouldn&#39;t be in vain.
	More ancient creatures, I thought grimly. It seems they 
brought back more than just me and a few others from the past. Pluto 
must be getting quite irritated. I cast a quick spell on me to help 
combat my exhaustion - more like prolong it - and set off towards the 
direction of the main Juuban district again. Knowing Luna she would 
probably be still in the communication center anyway.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Luna)
For a long while I stared after the retreating form of the redheaded 
elf. She must have hated it by now to always deliver bad news... 
Granted, what she had to say was a lot speculation but that was 
better than anything we had yet to learn about our mysterious enemy. 
And for once, as disturbing the info was, we might have a slight 
advantage against the next &quot;Youma&quot;. That info was nice, but I had no 
real hope that we would have the time to use it to prepare. 
Especially not with Minako&#39;s birthday coming up. I would rather cut 
my tail off again before ruining that with a tactic session. It would 
mean extra work for me and less sleep but I was going to take that 
risk.
	If Artemis was here, he would have dragged me home at this 
point despite all protests, however, the other cat had decided to 
stick with his mistress for the evening and the next day. I guess I 
wouldn&#39;t have done as well in Usagi&#39;s case. Artemis and Minako showed 
a bond and understanding I often envied. I know it was stupid and 
that their partnership had always been less interrupted by 
conflicting royal duties between the Princess and me, or the year - 
and a half now - they had in advance of working together closely in 
this time period.
	With a bit of regret I looked upon the sad fact that none of 
us had found a solution for the sudden unlocking of our natural-born 
shape-shifting ability in the last big battle. Ever since then both 
Artemis and me had tried again and again. And while I first had hoped 
it was just about the tail injury I suffered, it proved to be the 
unchangeable truth that the return of our abilities was, at least for 
now, a temporary thing. The sheer intensity of the situation and fear 
of loss might have broken through whatever blockage the hibernation 
had put on the ability to shift shape freely between cat and human.
	This made working a little hard. However, considering how 
long I did that already, it was just a slight discomfort. My paws 
were trained to control the big computers in the underground 
headquarters. I wouldn&#39;t complain about the better position being 
human would put me in but there was no sense in regretting what you 
couldn&#39;t have. And I had too much work ahead of me to whine about my 
bad fate.
	Within a very short time I had access to the network still 
existing on the Moon and the data I needed. This was something I felt 
very thankful for. Despite the enemy&#39;s presence the network was still 
working, a considerable amount slower and some sections were very 
hard to access, a circumstance we had traced back to the continued 
influence of negative energy. It didn&#39;t totally shut off the 
connections though.
	Priapos&#39; spies had reported about discovering a secret 
chamber and several sightings of the mysterious robed man before. The 
leaders seemed to stay away from the general henchman for most of the 
time which made it hard to get any identities in without drawing 
attention to the spies. The newest rumors, however, had told of 
something like an alarming high concentration of negative energy in 
an area that shouldn&#39;t even be there. Asara, the leader of the covert 
operation that I still knew from the past to be a very competent one, 
had provided Priapos with some of the mental readings. The Moon 
Computer had no problem converting the mental waves into data and if 
what I saw was anything close to the truth - and there was no way why 
a mental reading should or even could be faked - we were speaking of 
an energy akin to the Ginzuishou. Not just close, as Metallia had 
been, but practically on the same level. It was still undeveloped and 
posing no danger right now, but following the relative growth chart I 
had managed to execute on the little data available, I strongly 
believed my earlier analysis to be more than a distinct possibility.
	REQUESTED INFORMATION FOUND. DATA ARCHIVE &quot;DARK ENTITIES&quot; NOW 
AVAILABLE.
	PLEASE ENTER AUTHORIZATION CODE.
	&quot;Alana has fallen,&quot; I said, earning a sound of confirmation 
in return. Alana was a warrior very close to the Serenity of a couple 
of generations ago. Not many truly knew her or her role and what she 
had truly represented and it should stay that way.
	ARCHIVE NOW OPEN FOR ACCESS. ENTER SEARCH TOPIC?
	&quot;I will upload an energy signature for comparison. List 
results of closest matches.&quot; I did as I said and transferred the 
converted energy signature.
	AFFIRMATIVE. DATA RECEIVED. NOW SEARCHING...
	I knew that the search would take a while so I opened a low-
level side channel to review the data about Golems again. They were 
quite common, native to both Jupiter and Mars but with distinct 
differences between the two species. However, both were golems and 
golems tended to be hard to miss and so the info from the spies came 
as no small surprise. Alone the fact that gate transportation would 
be out of the question because the special nature of a golem that 
prevented such a method, would alert anyone in a near proximity to 
its dispatch.
	I wasn&#39;t quite sure what they hoped to achieve with this 
move. Golems were strong but usually very weak to combined magic 
power. One or two Senshi should be able to take one down without much 
problem, especially with Mercury&#39;s control over ice and water. That, 
of course, made me more wary. All of us who were familiar with the 
Aura Knights had detected the changes and the slight increase in 
power levels. This wasn&#39;t to be taken lightly. And there had been 
master craftsmen in the Silver Millennium who could make a golem that 
would be stronger than any three natural ones.
	So, that left either the conclusion that this one was a 
distraction or a more serious threat than you would first suspect. I 
wasn&#39;t sure what I would prefer other than the option - as 
unavailable as it was - that it wouldn&#39;t act until after tomorrow. 
The Senshi had been able to breathe again after the Aura Knight 
battles and tomorrow was supposed to be a relaxing day for everyone. 
Couldn&#39;t the forces of darkness for once give us a little rest?
	SEARCH COMPLETE. NOW LISTING RESULTS.
	I looked away from what I was doing to look at the bigger 
screen and the data rattling down. The list was actually pretty thin 
and most matches were so low I immediately dismissed the possibility. 
The Moon Archives had a fairly big database of dark beings clouded in 
mystery and doubted to exist by some. They tended to crowd the space 
around this solar system in the days of the Silver Millennium, unable 
to perceive the holy barrier created by the combination of Ginzuishou 
and the other planets. Recordings were inaccurate in the best of 
cases since there were not many brave - or stupid - enough to go 
outside and check.
	There was a record at the top of the list, though, I was 
unable to tear my gaze away from for several moments.
	95% MATCH
	LAGUNA FORCE
	POWERFUL ENTITY, RUMORED TO BE DIRECTLY BORN FROM THE VOID 
THAT WAS BEFORE THE CHAOS OF EXISTENCE. SUPPOSEDLY CAPABLE OF TIME 
MANIPULATION AND NEGATIVE ENERGY PRODUCTION NEAR THE GINZUISHOU&#39;S 
LEVEL. EXISTENCE DOUBTED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF MAGES AND HISTORIANS. 
NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE.
	REQUEST MORE DETAILED SEARCH?
	I shook my head to clear the dizziness that was threatening 
to overtake me. That was absurd. Granted, I had the nagging fear that 
this result would come out of the search but still... This data 
wasn&#39;t the most reliable because of the explained reasons. And the 
Laguna Force was a mythos...
	As was... had been the Venus Tear.
	&quot;Confirmed. Run detailed search, notify me or Artemis about 
any findings, as unimportant as they might seem.&quot;
	AFFIRMATIVE.
	I didn&#39;t feel very much like working anymore suddenly. I 
printed the information about golems, stowed them in subspace and 
left the center, some more troubling thoughts added to the ones 
already presented. It was getting crowded up there.

(Minako)
Birthdays in my life always had a special meaning. When people hear a 
special meaning, usually they associate something important or mostly 
good. In my case birthdays were always kind of the hope that the next 
one might be better. That sounds an awful lot pessimistic, I agree. 
However, having parents who tend to think of you as a little kid all 
the time doesn&#39;t help much to make your birthdays enjoyable. Not even 
in the private school I had visited before coming to Azabu-ku but 
also the first time at my school here was spent rather lonely, with 
only a couple of distant friends. Where other kids my age had big 
parties, with lots of people, mine were practically nonexistent. Dull 
and always the same.
	That is why my sixteenth birthday this year was so very 
special. In the span of about two years, my life had found the 
purpose I had always missed, friends and comrades to trust like 
sisters, a long-lost sister from a past life and not to mention a 
beautiful girl who wanted to be my girlfriend. This was definitely 
something to celebrate.
	And so, this morning, when I woke up and felt the oh so 
familiar warmth of the smaller form snuggled up to me, I didn&#39;t 
really think about parents in the house and the possibility of being 
found out. Still half asleep I rolled over slightly to gaze upon the 
sleeping body of the dark-haired girl, lying there in perfect 
serenity, and touched my lips to hers in a gentle kiss, slowly 
pulling her out of her slumber.
	The response was quickly to follow and I closed my eyes to 
savor the contact, semi-aware that it might be the only one we would 
get until we got out of the house. Both Hotaru and I had acquired a 
near harmony in our sleeping and it never took one much longer to 
follow the other to wakefulness. And quite frankly, those kisses were 
better than every alarm clock.
	&quot;Happy Birthday, Aino-chan,&quot; Hotaru whispered after finally 
parting. Even so early in the morning, right after waking, her gaze 
was so full of affection, her eyes so full of love. It was a miracle 
that we were able to hide it at all.
	I trailed a finger along her cheek, smiling fondly and 
cherishing the wonder of that amazing girl who was my girlfriend. &quot;It 
is already. I believe the best gift was delivered right into bed 
today.&quot; I grinned and kissed her on the nose before instincts took 
over and I couldn&#39;t help myself but initiate another one further 
below. Quickly the contact became heated and when I opened my eyes 
from the sensual overload I had subconsciously rolled on top of 
Hotaru.
	&quot;Geez,&quot; Hotaru tried to giggle but it came out more as a 
groan, &quot;you really know how to make a girl feel special.&quot; I didn&#39;t 
immediately pull away and a low moan came from the raven-haired girl 
under my heated gaze. &quot;Megami-sama... I want you...&quot;
	Against every instinct of my body I rolled off of Hotaru and 
sat up. &quot;I know. Maybe we can stay at Rei&#39;s tonight...&quot; I made a face 
as the mental image came up and couldn&#39;t suppress a giggle in which 
Hotaru joined in. I might even give it a try just for the sake of 
seeing Rei&#39;s face.
	However, keeping in mind what I had learned a couple of days 
ago, I wouldn&#39;t want to further aggravate the miko. Hotaru didn&#39;t 
know yet... not through me telling her at least. I had promised Rei 
not to tell anyone what she had been doing as the first attack came. 
Not because I thought it was the right thing to do, Kami knows I had 
every right to be mad at her myself. No, I had seen something far 
more important that day. I had seen a part of my own dream which 
still lies so far away. And that is why I knew that Rei would have to 
make that decision herself. Whether or not it was already made in her 
mind. Accepting or not accepting it was Rei&#39;s dilemma. Not mine, not 
anyone&#39;s else.
	&quot;Minako?&quot;
	I glanced back to Hotaru who was watching me worriedly. With 
a start I realized that I hadn&#39;t paid much attention. &quot;Huh? Gomen, 
Raven, what did you say? I was thinking about something else.&quot;
	Hotaru inclined her head but then shrugged. &quot;I was just 
saying we should get dressed. It&#39;s a bit late already and we both 
have to get to school. Your parents are probably wondering already 
what&#39;s taking us so long.&quot;
	I snorted at that. &quot;Sure. I believe that if I see it.&quot; 
Picking up a still snoring Artemis at the nape of his neck, I got the 
proper reaction of one irritated cat. &quot;Get up, lazy. And you were the 
one complaining all the time that I sleep too long.&quot; I grinned at his 
grumbling, half-asleep expression.
	I went in search of my clothes as Hotaru&#39;s voice halted 
me. &quot;I think you are misjudging your parents, Minako. I mean no 
offense and you know them better of course, but I think they may get 
more of what is going on when you think.&quot; Blinking, I stared back at 
her for a moment, searching for some hidden joke. There was none, 
however, and that made me stare some more. Hotaru cast her eyes 
downwards. &quot;Then again... Maybe I&#39;m just over-interpreting things. 
It&#39;s not that I have the role parents either.&quot;
	I dropped the shirt I was holding and went over to her to 
take her hand in mine. &quot;Never think that your opinion doesn&#39;t matter. 
Often it takes an outside observer to point out things you don&#39;t want 
to see. I still think they live just in their merry little world but 
I have seen people with even better acts - just for the moment saying 
it is one - who turned out to be something completely different. The 
both of us should know that all too well.&quot;
	A long silence followed the silence. I could see something 
glistering in Hotaru&#39;s right eye but she blinked it away. &quot;And again, 
you know how to make a girl feel special...&quot; she whispered and 
suddenly I found myself at the receiving end of a big hug which I 
didn&#39;t hesitate to return. The connection between us was as strong as 
ever. Any other would probably not have even noticed the small... 
tension in the brief exchange of words. I had and I knew fully fell 
that even after all this time Hotaru still tended to feel a bit 
insecure and unworthy of my love. I guess that is the dilemma of true 
love. It was a paradox and yet so fulfilling.
	&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a hypocrite but... It is twenty 
minutes &#39;til eight,&quot; Artemis pointed out, making us both jump and 
vanish in a flurry of motion...
	About five minutes later - I&#39;m still not sure how we managed -
 we had made it downstairs and to the table to grab a very quick bite 
of breakfast. Okaasan and Otousan were already at the table of course 
even though both wouldn&#39;t have to be out for work for a couple of 
days. Otousan had studied law in his youth and had for awhile 
actually been a lawyer but then turned his interest to architecture 
and became a well-reckoned realtor. Mother had also studied in this 
field but mostly was assisting her husband with his work these days. 
They managed quite a bit of premises over abroad and thus they were 
away quite often.
	&quot;A good morning, Minako,&quot; Otousan greeted without really 
looking up from his paper, &quot;and a Happy Birthday of course.&quot; He put 
the paper aside and nodded at us. &quot;You are a bit late for your own 
birthday, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot;
	I laughed sheepishly but inwardly I was fuming a bit. I knew 
that they were sometimes a little forgetful but totally disregarding 
Hotaru... It was probably nothing, I reasoned though, besides, we 
didn&#39;t have time anyway. &quot;Gomen, I guess it took me awhile to get to 
sleep yesterday.&quot; A good thing I knew how to pull off the one or 
other lie if need be. I actually had been in bed early and sleeping 
like a rock after the training session with Priapos.
	&quot;I am sure about that...&quot; I caught Otousan mutter and raised 
an eyebrow. Was it just me or had the temperature in the room just 
dropped?
	I looked over at Hotaru but before I could gauge her 
reaction, Okaasan had already come out of the kitchen with two 
plates. &quot;Hai, after all fourteen is a special age...&quot;
	I groaned, having almost expected that. &quot;I am sixteen 
now, &#39;Kaasan. Sixteen.&quot; I shot Hotaru a knowing look, as if daring 
her to repeat her earlier statement about more observant parents.
	Okaasan laughed in an attempt to downplay the matter. &quot;Of 
course, silly me, where is my mind this morning? But you should grab 
something to eat quickly or you are running late. And you don&#39;t want 
to stay in after school on your birthday, right?&quot;
	&quot;If she doesn&#39;t want to run late for her own party,&quot; Hotaru 
teased and we sat down to quickly devour our food at a speed that 
would have made Usagi stare. But I was hungry after yesterday&#39;s 
training and the constant battles required a constant nutrition. Ever 
since using the Venus Tear I understood partly why Usagi was 
consuming her food the way she did.
	&quot;So, you are going to celebrate with your friends, yes?&quot; 
Okaasan asked while Otousan had resumed reading. I nodded between a 
lungful of food and the next. Not that I was supposed to know but 
that was beside the point. &quot;Oh dear, and I guess it is too late for 
your gifts now... Hmm,&quot; she looked at Hotaru suddenly, &quot;why don&#39;t you 
come by after school and take them to your party?&quot; Otousan shot 
Okaasan a look that I found a little bit weird but didn&#39;t pay more 
attention, since I was concentrating on finishing the quick breakfast.
	Hotaru nodded in confirmation. &quot;Sure. But you could give them 
to me now, too...&quot;
	&quot;No, no... You really need to get to school and I think I 
haven&#39;t finished wrapping one of them since we were back so late...&quot;
	And that was pretty much the end of the discussion since 
Okaasan vanished into the kitchen. Hotaru and I exchanged a look and 
I shrugged, not quite understanding the behavior of my parents... 
Then again that was the norm, anyway.
	A couple of minutes later we were out of the door and I had 
to take us to the rooftops for us to make it to our schools in time.

(Mamoru)
The quiet of the apartment was often mundane and making me feel kind 
of lonely. Quite frankly I didn&#39;t spent much time alone in here or 
anywhere else lately. Especially the last days had been filled with a 
lot more social activity when I had wished for so fast. I wasn&#39;t 
complaining, though. After all the one good thing that came out of 
the wreckage of Tsukino-ke was the obvious acceptance of the older 
Tsukinos of Usagi and my relationship. Since Usagi had been busy with 
school and the party preparations I had actually offered to help out 
with rebuilding. It was more a suggestion from my girlfriend at first 
but I found her argument that maybe this was a chance for a bit more 
bonding occurring very valid.
	Ikuko and Kenji had gladly accepted the extra help and I was 
beginning to relax around the older Tsukinos. At least this one 
crisis seemed to be averted. And there was no clear recollection of 
the particular day&#39;s events that could get us in trouble as well. To 
be honest, Ikuko was actually a bit scary. She was so motherly it put 
shame to the term itself. I got along well with Kenji after a short 
awkward time and was actually considering taking a semester 
photography myself because it seemed to be more interesting than I 
had initially thought.
	I had the morning off... well, actually the whole day. The 
only two important classes I had on a Tuesday were cancelled and the 
rest were in the afternoon. Boring stuff. I didn&#39;t actually think I 
would ever say that as much as I didn&#39;t believe I would ever skip 
them for attending the birthday of one of my girlfriend&#39;s best 
friends. There was a first time for everything, I guess. And I really 
didn&#39;t need the classes. Usagi took that whole party very seriously. 
I suppose birthdays for all of us hadn&#39;t been that wonderful, not 
only in Minako&#39;s case. And here we were now, suddenly a group of very 
close friends, family actually, she felt it was her mission to make 
this party a lasting experience.
	I really did love her. Usagi was such a gentle soul and she 
always wanted the best for people. She wasn&#39;t perfect, even if she 
had discarded a lot of her quirks recently. She needed the attention 
of her friends just as much as she gave it. But that was a simple 
concept of giving and receiving. Usagi would never intentionally 
demand something of her friends or anyone for that matter. A rare 
trait if I&#39;ve ever seen one. She was a girl who simply loved life and 
wanted to enjoy it to its fullest. It was inspiring to people around 
her and you couldn&#39;t help but love her.
	And that was why I was so worried about her, worried about 
not being able to fulfill her expectations. Not that she would expect 
anything but... We had that already. I had felt powerless for a long 
time compared to her and now that I had found something at least 
coming remotely close to be helpful I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it, 
and yes, I was scared. Still scared. I didn&#39;t have much of a choice 
in that moment, when I drew on that incredible power, feeling what I 
had access to, what I could do, but now, afterwards, it was all 
starting to register.
	I sighed and took a deep breath, chastening myself for losing 
concentration. For a long moment I stared at the stones laid out on 
the small table. I was sitting in front of it lotus-style and trying 
to achieve a state of mental concentration where I could feel the 
flow of power again. Like in the Tsukinos&#39; house, but not forcefully 
this time. Gentle, probing, slowly... With my eyes closed, I slowly 
reached out to touch each stone, feeling the cool, smooth surface, 
the vibrations of dormant energy, the ripple under my fingertips... 
huh?
	My eyes snapped open and I saw the four stones each glow a 
different color. They were a Jadeite, a Nephrite, a Zoisite and a 
Kunzite. I never thought the significance of the names was a rare 
coincidence. Actually seeing the ghost-like figures floating over the 
stones now, only their heads and upper bodies visible, was still a 
shock. I did have flashes of memories but my past life was still 
rather blurry. The Senshi might have only dim recognition of theirs 
but I was even more detached from Endymion. Therefore I could only 
guess all the time to the significance and role of the four man in my 
memories. It all came rushing back to me now, slowly, in bits and 
pieces making hardly any sense but more than everything before.
	&quot;Master,&quot; the white-haired man, Kunzite, bowed his head. &quot;We 
are glad to see you at good health. Now that we are finally free of 
Metallia&#39;s control, we wish to aid you as best as our remains can. 
What is it you wish?&quot;
	I blinked a couple of times. That was all a little too much 
for me at once and the memories were still coming. I hadn&#39;t expected 
to actually achieve something on the first try anyway. The stones had 
been in my possession over a year - probably starting with the time 
loop - and I hadn&#39;t had any idea what exactly they were other than 
their obvious importance in some way or another.
	&quot;Master seems troubled about something,&quot; the one I knew as 
Jadeite said. Various feelings made themselves known. Conflicting 
feelings. Anger, hate, friendship, loyalty... They had tried to kill 
Usagi and the others but they had also been my... guardians. Yes, 
that was it. Metallia had taken them over just as she did with Beryl. 
But still there were all those times still fresh in my memory where 
they had caused the Senshi pain. I knew it wasn&#39;t their fault but...
	&quot;No really? Give him a moment to get his memories straight, 
will you? Our controlled selves aren&#39;t holding the most fondest place 
there, you know.&quot; That was Zoisite, chastening his fellow generals 
who fell silent for awhile which I was very thankful for. The storm 
of memories began to settle down. It wasn&#39;t an enlightenment in the 
sense of my whole past life revealed, it just took so long to sort 
out because of the conflicting feelings.
	&quot;It is good to see you again, my friends,&quot; I finally said 
with some sense of dignity. The smiles on their faces were warming 
and I allowed myself a moment of wistfulness. I wished they could be 
here in person. But that was beyond mine or anyone&#39;s power. Their 
physical selves were gone, their last remains were those stones and I 
knew deep in my heart that even those wouldn&#39;t hold forever. They had 
been great friends, and the most loyal ones I ever had known, much 
like the Senshi were to Usagi. Knowing that they were truly lost was 
saddening.
	Gathering my composure, I focused my mind back on the 
original task. I had started this seeking answers and that was still 
my purpose. &quot;I believe we have much to discuss...&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Rei)
Well, that was that, I thought morosely as I sat in the bus that 
would take me back to Hikawa Jinja. I would probably run a little 
late but I had had to do this now. It would be the last time I came 
too late because of possible carrier issues anyway. This chapter of 
my life and future was closed, for now at least. The sad thing was... 
they would have taken me. And no, of course they had not understood 
my decision but what could I have said to make it believable? Surely 
not, &quot;I have to fight Youma on a daily basis to protect the world 
from evil.&quot; Yes, that would have gone really well. Family problems 
were so damn overused and I doubt anyone believed that anymore.
	Sure, I was still young but showbiz was a tough field and 
just as I had said to Ami earlier, retreating is often like 
surrendering, especially if you are not established yet. It wasn&#39;t 
that the chance was totally gone but it would take years, especially 
with the little time that I had being a Senshi and with school, to 
get to the point I had worked to reach for almost a year. That&#39;s why 
it hurt so much to make that decision, regardless of the knowledge 
that it was the only possible decision.
	I couldn&#39;t get those images out of my head though. Images of 
D-Point. I&#39;m sure all of us had nightmares about that. However, I had 
been the last one to fall. I had seen Jupiter sacrifice herself. I 
had sensed Mercury die and it had felt like a sword had been rammed 
right through my soul. I had witnessed Venus die. And then my own 
death... But it was the memory as a spirit, of Moon sitting on the 
icy ground of the North Pole, lost and left alone, disbelieving of 
what happened to her friends, it was that memory that made my heart 
ache. I vowed that moment that if we ever earned ourselves a second 
chance that I would never, ever again let my friends and especially 
my best friend and Princess down like this. I had done everything I 
could and protected her but that moment I had felt like the worst 
friend in the world. I had felt like I had failed her.
	My friends were the most important thing to me and lately I 
hadn&#39;t actually been the role model of a good friend. That had been 
one of the major points in making my decision final. This whole 
ordeal had driven a bit of a wedge between us. Not too big to totally 
alienate me from my them but big enough to get me angry about things 
I normally would never have.
	Yes, I still wasn&#39;t sure what to think about Tomoe Hotaru. 
Her visit had, however, changed my view a little. I realized that I 
really had let my personal experience guide me and didn&#39;t let myself 
see the honest emotion between the two girls. I had watched them a 
little more carefully lately when I had the chance and could not deny 
that I had hardly seen anyone as happy in a long time ever since 
Serenity and Endymion. Usagi and Mamoru weren&#39;t as far ahead in their 
relationship as their alter egos had been and would still need some 
time to really develop, but I could clearly remember the sweet and 
unconditional - not to mention forbidden - love between Princess 
Serenity and Prince Endymion. The Senshi had all known about it and 
the main reason why none of us ever let something slip was because 
their love was simply too beautiful.
	I really wished I could be less prejudicial about the 
relationship between our leader and Tomoe Hotaru. That aside I 
believed that I would even get along very well with the younger girl. 
Every time I saw them, though, I involuntary had to remember that own 
bit of my past and I cursed myself forever making that mistake... or 
for being so damn curious. It didn&#39;t help that the memory was still 
so young and fresh.
	It wasn&#39;t fair to judge them because of my personal 
experience but unfortunately that experience had been a hard impact 
on my young life, with consequences that had opened wounds that I 
thought buried for a long while, to extend I doubted even Hotaru 
could have guessed. I was over the whole thing now.
	Or so I had thought. Then Minako brought Hotaru in and 
coupled with the stress my life was already in, it just all came 
rushing back. I had spent hours meditating in front of the Holy Fire 
to regain my center after my temper tantrum with Minako that day. And 
the ridiculous thing was neither of the two really had much to do 
with. Not really anyway. I had been more angry at myself for losing 
it at that moment, angry at myself for being so patronizing over my 
friends. And then there was the fact that they looked so damn alike...
	A memory flashed unbidden through my mind&#39;s eye and I pressed 
my eyes tightly shut, trying to ward off the images. This was in the 
past. I should concentrate on the present, there surely were enough 
problems in the present to concentrate on.
	I blinked twice and looked back out of the window, noticing 
that I had been so lost in thought that I had run the danger of 
almost missing my stop. Grabbing my bag, I got up as the bus pulled 
up in front of Hikawa Jinja. Time to leave all this behind me. Today 
was supposed to be a day of relaxing for us and I wanted to make it 
up to Minako for being so harsh lately. Especially after she had 
covered for me.
	I had just left the bus as a voice behind me called my name. 
I turned around to see Hitome standing there, smiling. &quot;Hitome? What 
are you doing here?&quot; I thought I had told her that she wouldn&#39;t have 
to come today because of the party... Or had I? Damn, I really had 
too much on my mind lately.
	Hitome mock-glared. &quot;What, just because you have a party I 
can&#39;t come? I&#39;m sure your grandfather needs some help, besides you 
could have invited me, you know?&quot; She sounded a bit hurt, adding, &quot;I 
am your friend, aren&#39;t I?&quot;
&quot;Of course you are,&quot; I stated vehemently, chastening myself for never 
actually thinking about asking. We had been so absorbed in our 
personal affairs that none of us had really thought about inviting 
people outside of the Senshi. I think Usagi hadn&#39;t even asked 
Naru... &quot;I thought, well... You don&#39;t know Minako that well and 
well...&quot; I fumbled weakly for an apology, then dropped my head and 
mumbled, &quot;Gomen.&quot;
Hitome&#39;s mock-glare turned into a gentle smile as she closed the gap 
between us and put a hand on my shoulder. &quot;Iie, don&#39;t apologize. I 
know you had a hard time lately. You can&#39;t think of everything after 
all.&quot; She laughed lightly, something that strangely always managed to 
raise my mood almost as well as Usagi could. &quot;I forgive you if I get 
some cake.&quot;
I laughed heartily and gave Hitome a brief hug before stepping 
back. &quot;How do you always do that?&quot; I asked. Hitome could be rather 
compassionate at times, displaying a maturity that you wouldn&#39;t 
expect of someone her age. The other girl was only about a year older 
than I was after all.
&quot;What do you mean? Not so long ago, people sometimes told me I could 
be quite a brat.&quot; Hitome smiled and I smiled back.
I suddenly felt so much better. In a spur of the moment thing I 
grabbed Hitome&#39;s hand and pulled her after me, running up the stairs, 
laughing. &quot;Come on! I bet Usagi already sampled half of the cake.&quot;

(Hotaru)
How long had it been since I had been in such good spirits? Well, 
everyday beginning with this one down to the day I met Minako the 
first time probably... I smiled quietly to myself as I walked down 
the street towards Aino-ke. That was the truth after all. The blonde 
bundle of energy had really changed my life so much, in more ways 
than one. However, today was a little different. Because right now I 
felt like nothing could touch me, nothing bad could happen to me. 
Today was my girlfriend&#39;s birthday, not to mention sort of an 
official welcome for me from her friends as well - regardless of how 
much I had protested. It felt good. No, let me correct that. It felt 
wonderful.
The last years had been awful. Lonely and scared of the world and 
myself in general I had spent the time only with myself, locked up in 
my room, and of course, the ever-present companion of sudden seizures 
and attacks of weakness. Those were gone now. As was the loneliness. 
And the fear of the world had began to dim to a vague background 
sensation. Like a scary dream that you forgot as soon as you were 
awake for a few moments and which left only a vague memory of how 
scaring and, in most cases, ridiculous it had been.
	Today would be a great day. Maybe even the last bit of 
animosity with Hino-san could be revolved. I felt that I had gotten 
through to her with my visit a couple of days ago. There weren&#39;t any 
acid comments when she was around anymore. She hadn&#39;t even protested 
to my presence or my part in the planning of the party. The miko 
hadn&#39;t said anything either but that was rather beside the point. In 
my heart I just knew she never meant her initial reaction to turn out 
quite the way it had.
	I was so positive about the fact that this would turn out to 
be a wonderful day, I completely ignored the prickling feeling of 
dread that had built up ever since I left Mugen to quickly snatch 
Minako&#39;s gift from her parents.
	Unlocking the door, Minako HAD given me a key after all, I 
stepped into the house. &quot;Tadaima,&quot; I called out, looking around for 
the Ainos.
	&quot;In the living room!&quot; came Aino Miyako&#39;s voice and I couldn&#39;t 
help but wonder at the odd strained tone in the normally cheerful 
voice. Then again, it could be a side effect because she had to 
shout. I shrugged it off as nothing, slipped out of my shoes and 
headed towards the living room.
	&quot;Konnichi wa, I just came by to...&quot; As soon as I stepped into 
the room, I noticed something was VERY amiss. Minako&#39;s mother stood 
leaning against a wall, her lips drawn together in a thin line, her 
arms obviously trying to decide whether to be crossed in front of her 
or to put her hands onto her hips... Neither was a very reassuring 
posture to me right now.
	Aino Satoru, Minako&#39;s father, was sitting on the couch, his 
newspaper discarded to the side. While you could see that Minako&#39;s 
mother was really about to explode about whatever was bothering her, 
he sat stoically and didn&#39;t let anything about his intent slip at 
all. I decided that was even harder to deal with.
	&quot;Come in, Hotaru-san,&quot; Minako&#39;s mother said. There was an odd 
strain on the suffix, not to mention that she had always called 
me &quot;Hotaru-chan&quot; from the first time I had stayed over. As I stepped 
into the room, tentatively, a sense of dread befalling me, I caught 
sight of Artemis skidding around the corner with a panicked 
expression. The feeling of dread heightened. But on the other hand I 
was in too good of a mood. And thus I told myself that it was 
unreasonable to think anything was wrong or at least that wrong that 
I couldn&#39;t handle it. Everything was fine in my life right now, 
finally. What could possibly go wrong?
	&quot;... get Minako&#39;s gift...?&quot; I finished, hesitantly, looking 
at the two adults with a bit of caution.
	&quot;I am afraid that won&#39;t be possible,&quot; Minako&#39;s father stated, 
just the tiniest hint of disapproval leaking through. I could tell 
now that a lot of the calm was a serious effort on his part. To hide 
what I wasn&#39;t sure.
	At my puzzled expression, Aino Miyako picked up for her 
husband, far less subtle. &quot;We will not allow you toy with our 
daughter ever again,&quot; she said sharply and I flinched at the look of 
anger in her eyes, boring into me like a spear of burning heat. Her 
hands seemed to clench and unclench now in an unsteady rhythm.
	&quot;Hah?!&quot; I stated intelligently, knowing that surely wasn&#39;t 
the best reply in this situation. But I couldn&#39;t help it. &quot;What are 
you talking about?!&quot; I felt a twinge of anger at the mere thought of 
me ever TOYING with Minako. The thought was the most absurd thing 
that had ever crossed my mind. And it never would have crossed my 
mind if the older Aino hadn&#39;t just voiced it. I wanted to laugh but 
found it neither appropriate nor really amusing. Ridiculous maybe 
but...
	&quot;We are talking about your... relationship... with Minako,&quot; 
Aino Satoru said.
	And suddenly the good mood crumbled away, the slight bit of 
anger that had been rising at hearing the accusation went out like a 
candle in the middle of a tornado. A sinking feeling began in my 
stomach and slumped further down until my knees threatened to give 
way. I sought the doorframe for support as I suddenly felt weak.
	&quot;You... know?&quot; I managed weakly, denying not even crossing my 
mind. The way the two parents were, it was plain that anything I 
would have said would have done more harm than good. And this was 
surely not good. Not today, I thought almost pleading mentally. 
Onegai, not today. We are not ready for that right now! This was 
supposed to be a happy day, Minako&#39;s birthday. How could they have 
found out now and... Something managed to pierce through her frantic 
thoughts with a sharp, clicking sound as what Aino Miyako had said 
begin to register fully and connect with the knowledge that the Ainos 
were aware of her and Minako&#39;s relationship. &quot;Matte... You think that 
I...?&quot;
	&quot;YES!&quot; roared Minako&#39;s mother and I almost stumbled back in 
shock. &quot;I can&#39;t believe I thought you were such a sweet and nice girl 
while behind our back you were seducing our daughter, IN OUR HOUSE! 
Our little Minako-chan is still too young for that! Not too mention 
that a whore like you doesn&#39;t deserve her at all!&quot;
	&quot;Now, Miyako. Please, we want to be civil about this...&quot; 
interjected Minako&#39;s father at this point but met deaf ears.
	&quot;Well, I DON&#39;T! Minako&#39;s going to find a nice young man one 
day and not the likes of her. I don&#39;t want someone like her here any 
longer.&quot; Her eyes flared as she focused her sole attention on me. I 
had been following everything in a dazed state, not quite believing 
what I heard. Renewed anger warring with the old, oh so familiar 
feelings of rejection, a youth of spite, prejudices and loneliness. 
It was so easy to fall back into that routine. I had heard it so 
often, the murmurs, the accusations the disdain of the other students 
because they didn&#39;t understand me. I was a freak in their eyes as I 
probably was right now in the eyes of Aino Miyako. And I could hear 
the rejection coming again, clearly, as if spoken already. The order 
for me to leave, back to the cold place that I hadn&#39;t considered home 
ever since staying here for the first time. Back to my old room. 
Alone, feared, scared and sealed off from the world. That I did not 
deserve someone as pure and wonderful as Minako...
	However, then there was Minako herself. There was the time 
spent with the gorgeous blonde who had always tried to boost my self-
confidence, who had always been there for me and who made such an 
effort to reintroduce me to the world. I had never felt so loved 
before. I had never felt so NEEDED before. There was no doubt in my 
heart that what we had was pure, pure and unconditional. Minako had 
been the best thing that ever happened to me and the mere thought 
that I could ever do to her what the raging woman implied hit too 
close to home. It simply was too close to the accusations of the 
other students, the whispers behind my back...
	And then things went from worst to purely chaotic. So 
absorbed into the confrontation, I only had a mere moment of warning 
recognition before the sharp voice of my girlfriend, lover and mate 
cut off her mother&#39;s surely final say in this matter. &quot;I hope I 
didn&#39;t hear you just call my girlfriend a whore.&quot;
	I turned my head slowly while shivering at the iciness in her 
voice. I had no idea what she was doing here but that really didn&#39;t 
matter. She must have been here for a bit or maybe just heard that 
bit coming in. And the sheer lack of emotion in that freezing cold 
tone of voice made me squirm even though I wasn&#39;t the one it was 
directed at. I knew all too well that Minako was fiercely protective 
of me, something that I surely didn&#39;t mind and that always felt more 
like a sense of security than dominance. Heck, she had lifted a whole 
base full of Youma in order to save me from Adonis! But that voice... 
And that look in her eyes.
	&quot;What, you are not even denying it?!&quot; screeched her mother, 
her shock about Minako&#39;s entrance obviously quickly overcome.
	Minako regarded her mother with an emotionless stare. 
Emotionless and indifferent. She didn&#39;t blink, didn&#39;t raise her voice 
or anything when she replied but there was a note of acid in there 
and I felt the barely controlled volcano of emotion through our 
link. &quot;I don&#39;t need to deny the best thing that ever happened in my 
life. And I really do not hope that I don&#39;t have to deny something 
that I thought I heard you say, Okaasan.&quot;
	And suddenly everything crumbled completely. The last 
semblance of order. Everything that had happened to me over the last 
months. The happy memories, the wonderful times spent together, the 
thought that for once in my life I was happy again, it all burst like 
a bubble. Easy and simple like that, proving how fragile such a tiny 
thing was. And everything came back. The whispers, the accusations 
and as much as I tried to deny, to show it away my consciousness 
screamed at me that I hadn&#39;t been doing anything different than I had 
done all this time since the accident. That I was selfish, that I was 
taking Minako away from her friends, that I made her and Rei fight, 
that I took most of her time away and - the one that hit home the 
most - that I was now about to destroy the relationship between 
Minako and her parents.
	And I knew how that was. I knew better than anyone else how 
valuable a family was as uncaring as they might seem. They were still 
her parents. I had lost all of my family in the accident. Okaasan, 
Megumi and Otousan too. If not in body, then at least his soul.
	And the fundament of confidence built up over the months just 
could not stand against the thought that I was now destroying 
Minako&#39;s family if not in the literal, then the very least in the 
emotional sense. And that fragile fundament crumbled as I turned to 
flee the room.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Makoto)
&quot;Golems are basically the oldest of the semi-human species that 
exist. Species like elves, fairies and other far less known ones that 
you shouldn&#39;t concern yourself with now. They have been known to 
exist both in the Deeplands of Jupiter, the uninhabited surface 
regions, as well as on Mars. There are some superficial difference 
that will be necessary for a fighting tactic.&quot;
	Everyone was gathered at the Jinja. The preparations were as 
complete as they could be and everyone was there other than Minako 
and Hotaru. Getting a moment alone had been hard though and Luna 
obviously wanted to tell us about some new creature that might drop 
in soon. Obviously Priapos&#39; contacts had spotted it but Luna had no 
idea when it would happen. Nobody really objected to Minako not being 
here even though she was our leader. First off, this was her birthday 
and none of us wanted to really bother her with Senshi business. Also 
it was given knowledge that Minako seemed to be much more in tune 
with her past self. From all of us she would be more likely to know 
how to deal with a golem than we did.
	&quot;Golems from Mars are extremely resistant to heat. But they 
are few and actually not very useful in combat. Their stone skin has 
adjusted to the volcanic heat of the subterranean areas they used to 
live in and every rapid change in outside temperature would make them 
extremely sensitive. Golems from Jupiter though are far more 
adaptable because of...&quot;
	&quot;... the chaotic weather,&quot; I finished absentmindedly. &quot;They 
are far more resistant to their natural weakness, water, because of 
the thunderstorms and heavy rain...&quot; I trailed off, blinking, as I 
noticed everyone looking at me. The memory began to fade even though 
I tried to hold onto it. &quot;Darn, it&#39;s gone... There was something 
about special kinds...&quot; I tried to recall whatever had been nagging 
at my mind ever since Luna mentioned the word golem. It had been like 
a nagging sense of... something. I didn&#39;t know what but it was a 
strong pull and it seemed very important. I wished I had Minako&#39;s 
connection with her past self...
	I shook my head in the negative at Luna&#39;s inquiring 
gaze. &quot;Gomen, I can&#39;t remember. Ever since you said &#39;golem&#39; there was 
something that felt important nagging me but...&quot;
	I looked around when I felt a hand on my shoulder to see Ami 
looking at me worriedly. &quot;It&#39;s alright. Don&#39;t try to force it.&quot; She 
smiled. &quot;I am sure we can take of this golem now that we know what we 
are dealing with.&quot;
	&quot;For once,&quot; mumbled Rei, keeping an eye on the door. Hitome 
had gone to help Yuuichirou with something, which had actually given 
us the time to talk in the first place. The miko was in far better 
spirits when she and her friend came in. Nobody had really protested 
about the addition to the party. She was Rei&#39;s friend and I was sure 
Minako wouldn&#39;t mind.
	&quot;Ami-chan is right,&quot; said Usagi cheerfully, obviously trying 
to get back into my good graces because I had caught her ALMOST 
sampling some of Minako&#39;s cake. &quot;Luna said already that a golem won&#39;t 
stand a chance against the Senshi. So what is to worry?&quot; I think she 
knew better than anyone else what to worry about. The horror of the 
Aura Knights was still fresh in our memory. That had been our 
toughest battle, yet. The toughest battle that we survived anyway... 
But no one said anything, we all knew that. And we all knew that the 
power-up the Aura Knights had received could have easily been applied 
to that golem, too.
	&quot;I know. It just irks me that we know so little about our 
real enemy. Every little detail could help us. There is something 
about Golems, special types that...&quot; The solution to the puzzle fled 
away again and I gritted my teeth. Chastening myself for my 
impatience I took a deep breath, recalling my Martial Art lessons.
	I only vaguely heard Luna speaking when I began to focus 
inwardly, relaxing but at the same time concentrating. Not force, I 
had to let it come to me... &quot;Special types? Well, there were 
artificial works to animate Golems but compared to the natural ones 
they were mostly mindless and with a very short lifespan. They were 
not helpful other than as workers for easy tasks that required a lot 
of muscle... Makoto?&quot;
	Something passed through my mind. It was faint and really not 
much but I grabbed onto it, speaking before it got away again. &quot;I 
remember someone I once knew, in my past life. That person could make 
golems that were more advanced then anything. He...&quot; The memory 
drifted away again and despite my best efforts I couldn&#39;t reclaim it. 
Sighing I opened my eyes again, relaxing my body. &quot;That&#39;s all, 
gomen...&quot; A sudden urge to get out of here overcame me and I stood 
up. &quot;I... I need some fresh air.&quot; Ignoring the stares of the others I 
walked to the door, slid it open and sat down outside. Something 
about the memory I tried to recall about the man - I think it was a 
man at least - disturbed me. I didn&#39;t know why or who that person was 
but once again I couldn&#39;t get the feeling out of my head that it was 
important and that knowing would maybe make it even more disturbing. 
Maybe it was a mental block of my past life&#39;s subconsciousness.
	&quot;Want to speak about it?&quot;
	I sighed, somehow I wasn&#39;t surprised. I had expected Ami to 
follow me actually. That time we had spent together, it felt like we 
were getting attuned to the other. Not like... lovers or something, 
more like that we knew what the other would be doing. It didn&#39;t 
bother me. I had grown to like the other girl&#39;s constant company. Ami 
never pushed a subject or pressed me to talk when she thought I 
should.
	I chuckled slightly, trying to shake off the feeling of... I 
didn&#39;t even know of what exactly. &quot;I wish I would talk to myself 
about it.&quot; At Ami&#39;s blank look I finally laughed. &quot;The memory 
disturbed me somehow but I have totally no idea why. I think Jupiter 
is shying away from it or something.&quot; Shaking my head I leaned back 
against one of the pillars and closed my eyes, my stress level 
already rapidly falling. &quot;I don&#39;t know why I bolted anyway. Just head 
to get away and clear my head.&quot;
	Ami was silent for some time and we sat there with only the 
sounds of the birds that had taken residence in the trees disrupting 
the silence. &quot;When I first met you, you would have been more... 
frustrated about it. Now, you just get out, sit down and then after a 
few minutes you seem okay again.&quot; It was a statement but the way she 
said implied a lot more. I could understand that. The recent training 
I had gotten had helped my self-discipline a lot. She was right, a 
year ago or so I would have wanted to clobber something. However, I 
wasn&#39;t the only one here who Ami&#39;s statement could include.
	&quot;And when I first met you, you would have stayed inside, 
worrying maybe, but you would have told yourself to respect my 
privacy.&quot; I turned my head to smirk slightly at her startled 
expression. Ami looked as if she had just realized it herself. &quot;We 
all changed in some small ways. We are all older and more mature now, 
Ami. You are not saying that I am not allowed to grow up, are you?&quot;
	Ami shook her head, a small smile tugging on her lips. &quot;You 
are right. And even though we changed, what we really are, the 
inside, is still there, right?&quot;
I nodded at that and we continued to sit there for a few minutes 
longer in silence before joining the others inside.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Minako)
A thousand emotions stormed through my head. I had just gotten out of 
school when Artemis reached me, telling me that somehow my parents 
had found out about Hotaru and me. I think Kanzaki-san would have 
only seen dust at the marathon two weeks ago if I had run this fast 
then.
	But all that didn&#39;t help anything because the harm was 
already done the moment I reached our house. For the first time I 
cursed and blessed my sensitive Senshi hearing at the same time 
because I could clearly pick up any shouted or spoken world several 
feet away from the door. When I had reached the door, I heard it loud 
and clear, that one word my mother used and it struck like a 
sledgehammer right into my heart. For a moment I couldn&#39;t move, 
couldn&#39;t breathe, couldn&#39;t think... Then a coldness settled down 
right there and an arctic rage, burning with an intensity of a cold, 
blue flame of the kind I had never felt it before began to burst 
forward. And everything except the need to defend my mate was 
suddenly gone.
	Aino Minako disappeared into the background. Venus, Hebe, 
they all melted into each other and all that was left dominating was 
the corporal form of our bond. All other aspects of my personality 
were just a background sound, a vague presence, nothing more. Only 
the need to protect was there, the need to defend, defend the honor 
of my mate. Looking back that was all a little scary. I hadn&#39;t been 
totally out of control since I mostly agreed with that part right 
that moment but it was still a terrific feeling.
	And then, without warning, all that warped again as my mate, 
Hotaru, fled the room and the sheer emotional echo from our bond was 
pressing my heart together into a small abstraction of itself and 
then threw it away carelessly in a garbage can... I could not better 
describe it because never before had I felt this much pain before. 
Not at the end of the Silver Millennium, when Kunzite tried to kill 
me, and not at D-Point, seeing Mako-chan and feeling Ami die. This 
time it was worst. Far more than I ever imagined one person could 
feel and I wasn&#39;t even the one who actually felt it!
	No, that wasn&#39;t right. Hotaru&#39;s pain was like my pain and so 
I considered it mine as well.
	And the cold rage turned into a burning volcano.
	&quot;Look what you&#39;ve done!&quot; I screeched, hot tears streaming 
down my face as I felt my resolve and emotional shields had already 
collapses under the emotional backlash from Hotaru. I could feel the 
turmoil of my mate over our bond even though she was putting an 
effort in shielding it from me... a vain effort. &quot;I needed all summer 
to get her that happy and self-confident as she was a few minutes 
ago! Hotaru is a sweet and wonderful girl and if anyone doesn&#39;t 
deserve someone here, then I don&#39;t deserve her. She lost all of her 
family in an accident, her father is a cold, heartless bastard and 
she never had any friends... But, but...&quot; My voice wavered, sobs 
disrupting the strength and fury I tried to back it up with until it 
was only a whisper. &quot;She&#39;s the best thing that ever happened to me. 
And I love her so much it hurts...&quot;
	Okaasan had been ready to retaliate in kind but my words must 
have had some effect because she stepped back a little startled at 
the abrupt change in volume. Otousan stood up at this point and took 
a tentative step forward. &quot;Minako-chan, all we want is your best and 
that you are happy. We are you parents and we should know what...&quot;
	I laughed. I couldn&#39;t help it anymore. I laughed. And it 
wasn&#39;t amusing or ridiculous. It was neither funny nor sarcastic. All 
it was, was a release of emotion bubbling to the surface. Like a huge 
bubble needing to burst before it would consume me inside out. Both 
of my parents stared at me not quite comprehending. But how could 
they? How should they ever since they never had understood anything 
about me before?
	&quot;I can&#39;t believe I actually thought Hotaru might be right 
that you are a little more observant than I always thought.&quot; I 
laughed again, devoid any real emotion. But a little bit of sadness 
began leaking through and I think they heard it, for once. &quot;You 
think, you know what is best for me?&quot; I looked at them hard before 
finally closing my eyes, deciding that I had been here long enough. 
No use in being dramatic now when I needed to be elsewhere. &quot;You 
never ever cared,&quot; I said quietly, almost too low to hear. &quot;You never 
remembered my right age, you never remembered my friend&#39;s names or 
that I never used to have that many before. You never ever cared 
about me or anything that is going on in my life. It didn&#39;t matter to 
me because I found people who really care about me. But now... Well, 
I guess this is it...&quot;
	I started to take a step forward when Okaasan&#39;s voice stopped 
me briefly. &quot;Wh-where are you going?&quot;
	I considered saying something but my thoughts were already 
somewhere else. Why bother anyway? It didn&#39;t matter. She wouldn&#39;t 
understand. Without another word I started to walk away, slowly at 
first, step by step, ignoring the calling of my name. But then I 
began to run finally unable to resist the sensation of powerful 
grieve from the other end of our link anymore. I ran, tears 
continuing to run down my cheeks. I didn&#39;t care.
	Flashes of my time spent with Hotaru flew before my mind&#39;s 
eye.
	That rainy night, the alleyway, our first meeting. London, 
the meeting at the airport, the Youma, her saying my name even though 
I was transformed. Our first kiss, our first night together. It had 
been so rushed and at the same time felt so unbelievable right. That 
time in England, getting to know each other, Priapos and Adonis, 
Hotaru getting kidnapped... Raiding Adonis&#39; hideout, desperately 
trying to save my heart&#39;s desire, almost defeated by Adonis and 
then... Then that icy fear and the disbelief about my mate&#39;s true 
identity and following that the relief and the assurance that 
whatever happened she would be protected.
	&quot;Your duty will always come before your love,&quot; Adonis had 
said once and I had defied his premonition. He didn&#39;t want to believe 
it but I did.
	My feet had a mind of their own, always following the strong 
tug from the other sight of the invisible but quite real band that 
tied us together. Never had I felt that strongly. The only who I 
would give the same for was Usagi/Serenity. Times spent without a 
boyfriend, without that special partner at your side, the many failed 
dates, they had been just a phantom in the night during the time 
spent together with Hotaru. However, now they were all raging freely 
again and an indescribable fear of losing the one thing I had 
searched so long for threatened to swallow me.
	Then I found her. And all the words I had tried to perform, 
all the reassuring, the kind and gentle whispers of love were blown 
away like cherry blossoms in the wind. She was sitting there on that 
little bench in our backyard, head in her hands, shaking with silent 
sobs, her hair like a veil, a protection from the world. However, the 
moment I fully came to a stop, Hotaru looked up and our eyes met.
	There was nothing but us.
	They say that words can never really explain love. That is 
true. They say that a single kiss can say more than a thousand words. 
True. But also true is that you don&#39;t need a kiss, a gesture, a word 
or anything else if your love is honest. All you needed was each 
other.
	I could see it in her eyes. All the emotions, the rejection 
she had lived through for more than six years. The consequences of 
that accident, the demonic presence in her scaring away everything 
and everyone that wanted to get close to her. The long hours spent 
alone, in the room. And the feelings of hate. Not towards the world 
but towards herself. The unbidden thoughts of being evil and unworthy 
of any kind of love, be it even that of her family who had been taken 
from her. The small part that still blamed herself for the accident 
even though it was absurd. And then the realization that she might 
have done the same with me, fear of having me separated from my 
friends and now my family. I could see it all in that one moment.
	And Hotaru saw my feelings. I do not need to guess, I know 
she did.
	With two steps I was next to her on the bench and pulled her 
in my arms, tears now freely streaming down my face as my school 
uniform I was still wearing began to soak from our mingled tears. I 
wrapped my arms firmly around the younger girl and buried my head in 
her hair as she had hers buried in my shirt. No word was said but I 
began to softly hum a melody of a song I had liked to listen to while 
I was in England.

	&quot;Looking in your eyes now, I see a paradise
	This world that I found is too go to be true
	Standing here beside you, want so much too give you
	This love in my heart that I&#39;m feeling for you&quot;

	I know what you are thinking right now, Hotaru. But it&#39;s not 
true. You are not a horrible person, you never were. If anyone, then 
I am. I love you so much, I never want to be separated from you even 
though I want you to go out into the world and be a normal girl as 
you always wanted to be.
	I was a little bit surprised as Hotaru&#39;s voice joined into 
the lyrics. It was muffled, and hoarse but at the same time probably 
the most beautiful thing I had ever heard.

	&quot;Let &#39;em say we&#39;re crazy, I don&#39;t care about that
	Put your hand in my hand, baby, don&#39;t ever look back
	Let the world around us, just fall apart
	Baby, we can make it if we&#39;re heart to heart

	And I heard her thoughts that moment as clearly as she had 
mine.
	All I ever wanted was you. Because of you my life suddenly 
makes sense. When I am with you I feel that my only purpose is to be 
at your side. And it is the most wonderful thing I can imagine. You 
are not selfish. If love is a selfish thing then pretty much everyone 
would be selfish. I am sorry for running, sorry for doubting you. I 
know you would never think that about me. There just has been so much 
pain and heartbreak in my life already. I can&#39;t stand it anymore.
	As we fell into the chorus, our voices gaining strength, 
drawing from the bottomless pool that was our love, joining as did 
our thoughts.

	&quot;And we can build this thing together
	Stand this storm forever
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us now
	And if this world runs out of lovers
	We&#39;ll still have each otherNothing&#39;s gonna stop us,
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us now&quot;

	They can yell at us, they can try to pull us apart but we 
will always find together again. We will survive this and every other 
challenge life throws at us because we love each other. We don&#39;t need 
words. We don&#39;t need reassurance. We just need each other. And we 
will always have each other.

	&quot;I&#39;m so glad I found you, I&#39;m not gonna lose you
	Whatever it takes, I will stay here with you
	Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
	Whatever it takes, here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do&quot;

	You are the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. You have 
so much good in you that you never want to acknowledge. I feel 
sometimes like I pale to your inner beauty. You are strong and brave 
and you have always been there for me without a question, without a 
thought. If it means to break with my family to be with you, I will. 
There is simply no contest there. I can&#39;t stop loving you. I can&#39;t 
give you up. Never again.

	&quot;Let &#39;em say we&#39;re crazy, what do they know
	Put your arms around me, baby, don&#39;t ever let go
	Let the world around us just fall apart
	Baby, we can make it we&#39;re heart to heart&quot;

	I know what you mean because I am feeling the same. From the 
moment we first met I knew you were my fate. I didn&#39;t really 
understood it then but that feeling never left me, until I saw you 
again and then it only grew, we...

	&quot;And we can build this thing together
	Stand this storm forever
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us now
	And if this world runs out of lovers
	We&#39;ll still have each other
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us,
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us...&quot;

	We can&#39;t stop to love each other. Even if we suddenly 
couldn&#39;t stand each other&#39;s presence, we couldn&#39;t stay apart. It is 
scary but it is also a wonderful feeling.
	Hotaru had her head rested on my shoulder now, our voices now 
clear. Not loud but devoid the former grief and if anyone could have 
heard, they would have stopped to listen for sure.

	&quot;Oh, all that I need is you,&quot; I sang with absolute 
conviction, my thoughts echoing the lyrics.
	&quot;All that I ever need&quot; answered Hotaru in kind and she raised 
her head to look at me again. Our eyes met again. The world had long 
ago faded around us.
	&quot;And all that I want to do,&quot; I continued and it felt more 
like I said it.
	&quot;Is hold you forever, and ever and ever,&quot; we joined together, 
a warm feeling rushing through our bond. The sensation too much and 
too unique to ever try to describe. I leaned in for a brief kiss and 
found Hotaru&#39;s lips halfway, my arms drawing her even closer.

	&quot;And we can build this thing together
	Stand this storm forever
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us now
	And if this world runs out of lovers
	We&#39;ll still have each other
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us,
	Nothing&#39;s gonna stop us now&quot;

	And as we sang the final chorus, a peace settled over me that 
I had not known ever before. Despite all that happened, all the 
possible consequences. I never felt so at peace, then at that very 
moment. And I didn&#39;t realize the next thought at first but then I did 
it startled me and at the same time felt so natural.
	If I ever have to choose, I would put you before my duty, 
Hotaru... Always.
	We sat there on the bench of our backyard for a long time, 
wrapped in each other&#39;s arms, marveling in that forever fresh feeling 
of love and an intensity I never could have imagined. I thought what 
we had was strong already. But right this moment, nothing could 
compare to the feelings of absolute belonging. Barriers were simply 
failing and thoughts of rejection, loneliness and grief simply faded 
in each other&#39;s presence.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
&quot;Did we say something wrong?&quot; I wondered, looking at Rei. Ami had 
left shortly after Makoto which surprised both of us. Ami normally 
would never rush after someone when they obviously wanted to be 
alone. Not that I didn&#39;t like the change. The first few times I had 
taken Ami shopping I quickly got the impression that she actually 
wanted to be more normal and not just scooped up in class or her room 
studying all the time. The change now was rather subtle but I think 
it had a great deal to do with the fact that she and Mako-chan were 
living together. It seemed they were getting awfully attached. Of 
course, I was probably interpreting too much into it and talking to 
Rei about those things right now would not end well.
	&quot;Psychic flashes and mental exercises can do that to you,&quot; 
Rei replied, glancing at the closed door where the two girls had 
vanished. &quot;When I get visions sometimes they can call up old memories 
that I really don&#39;t want to remember.&quot;
	&quot;It&#39;s a gift and a curse sometimes, isn&#39;t it?&quot; Hitome chimed 
in, coming back into the room, thus making any Senshi-related 
conversation impossible. Rei smiled at her and nodded. I was glad 
that Rei was in such a better mood. Hitome was doing her some good 
obviously. I had quickly learned in the little time I knew Hitome 
that Rei seemed to listen to her. To know that Rei had found a friend 
as good as Hitome who wasn&#39;t a Senshi proved that we all had grown up 
some and the other girls slowly begin to leave their lonely past 
behind.
	Speaking of friends outside the Senshi... I knew I had 
forgotten something... or someone. Before I could rack my brain 
further, the answer literally entered the room, in company of a 
rather cheerful Priapos. I froze up momentarily, loathing at myself 
for forgetting to invite Naru. She was our friend, not too mention my 
best friend since childhood, and I had totally forgotten about it.
	&quot;Hello, minna-san. Seems we are not the last ones after all,&quot; 
Priapos greeted and Naru waved. I was torn between jumping up and 
asking for forgiveness and the urge to just hide somewhere. Long 
things short, I felt fairly awful right now as I watched the two 
girls sitting down, while I was stuck on my place, unmoving.
	Naru looked at me with a slight smile and a nod but didn&#39;t 
seem to further comment. Up to this day I was not really sure how she 
managed to do it. I would probably be fuming by now if my best friend 
ignored me for weeks, instead hanging out with several other people 
at the same time with no apparent, logical explanation. It wasn&#39;t 
that Naru knew Minako much more than a couple of hours spent together 
since all the chaos had begun, however, that was beside the point. 
Naru and I had ALWAYS invited the other to one of our parties if it 
was possible in any way. And I seriously had no intention of 
excluding her.
	And yet, Naru did not comment at all and likewise didn&#39;t seem 
angry about it. Why I had become much calmer lately I admired her for 
always being so kind AND polite at the same time. After my first 
awakening as Serenity in this time, I had been pretty unwilling to 
accept all that happened. One of my wandering thoughts produced 
during this tragic periods was that Naru would probably make a much 
better princess than I ever could.
	Obviously sensing my inner conflict, Naru had turned and 
taken my hand, which snapped me out of my little reverie. &quot;Usagi. It 
is alright. No one expects you to think of everything. You are as 
much human as I am.&quot; A loaded statement, surely. Somehow I almost got 
the impression Naru KNEW this. Luna had dropped a suspicion in this 
direction but I had shrugged it off. There was no way a normal girl 
like Naru could penetrate a Senshi&#39;s glamour on her own. Naru smiled 
and squeezed my hand. &quot;We all had a lot of stress lately and you 
picked up a few new, good friends. I appreciate that, really, because 
you surely deserve it.&quot;
	I felt a little put off by the sudden praise. Hearing 
something like that was new for me. While it was true that Naru had 
always stood up for me even when I really deserved a taunt or joke, 
such sentences were rare and often only came up when she felt guilty 
about something. Sometimes I really wondered why she stuck to me all 
those years. Naru could have had a lot of better friends that were 
not as clumsy and embarrassing as I had been and still was 
occasionally.
	Such is the ways of best friends, I suppose.
	&quot;I am still sorry, Naru-chan. I didn&#39;t want you to feel left 
out,&quot; I said and squeezed back. There was a moment of silence between 
us, everyone else was watching, too. Then we blinked and laughed a 
little embarrassed at the sudden emotional episode. Not embarrassed 
because of being emotional. Just that it was actually silly and one 
knew exactly what the other was thinking anyway.
	Conversation turned to trivial things then. Like exams and 
such things. The last results had been surprisingly well lately, for 
all of us. After the Aura Knight disaster it had been quiet on that 
front and we all had time to concentrate on our grades. I just hoped 
we would have this crisis solved BEFORE the final exams came which 
would determine whether or not we could all go to the same high 
school as we had decided to at least try.
	One thing had me curious though and that was the interaction 
between my best friend and Priapos. The two seemed to have hit it off 
fairly well. Maybe I was just seeing things but there was something 
in the way they... Must be Minako&#39;s influence, I corrected myself. 
The blonde had the funny idea that they were in love or something. 
Which was silly, of course. Naru was still with Umino the last time I 
checked and the boy was so devoted to her that Naru would never 
really think about hurting him like that. She just had too big of a 
heart to ever do this to him.
	Makoto, who had joined us with Ami again shortly after the 
two had arrived, looked at her watch. &quot;They sure are taking long. 
Shouldn&#39;t Hotaru be here by now, she is finished earlier, right?&quot; To 
be honest, I was becoming a little worried myself. It would be just 
our luck for something to happen at one of our birthdays. The cosmos 
seemed to like play its pranks when we least needed it. However, I 
had no intention of getting paranoid today. Everything was peaceful 
for once and even Rei enjoyed herself.
	&quot;Oh, I... met... Hotaru-chan on her way to school. She told 
me it could be a little later. They overslept this morning and now 
she&#39;s getting Minako&#39;s gift from her parents,&quot; Priapos explained. 
Nobody worried yet about Minako since she had her school&#39;s sport 
courses to attend to which sometimes took longer than planned.
	&quot;I am surprised they actually got her something,&quot; Rei, off 
all people, remarked dryly. Then again... I didn&#39;t really know that 
much about Rei&#39;s parents and their history but I got enough of an 
impression that it wasn&#39;t something she liked to discuss. &quot;I mean...&quot; 
she elaborated, quickly covering the blush that came with the stares 
she received. &quot;I was over there a couple of times and I must admit 
they ARE pretty scatter-brained...&quot; Somehow I expected a question how 
long Rei and Minako knew each other from Naru or Hitome. Rei was 
probably speaking about the time we fought the Dark Kingdom. 
Amazingly enough no question came which made me twitch for no 
apparent reason. &quot;Even more when Usagi sometimes is,&quot; Rei added 
almost like an afterthought.
	&quot;Hey!&quot; I protested but failed to actually get angry. Instead 
I allowed myself a smile and upon seeing Rei return it, harrumphed 
and looked away in mock-fuming. Yes, Rei was definitely more her 
usual self today. Thank the Kami. I don&#39;t think I could have endured 
more of the Rei of late for very long.
	&quot;Are they really that...&quot; Naru started but was interrupted as 
several things happened almost at once. Priapos suddenly stiffened 
and then doubled over in pain without any warning at all. While 
everyone rushed to her side, the familiar noise of the Mercury 
Computer made its presence known. The last thing that really made my 
head swirl with too many things at once to process, was Naru&#39;s 
reaction. &quot;Pria-chan!&quot; she called out, reacting quickly to steady 
the - I checked - still quite disguised elf. How had...?
	Shoving the thought back for the moment, I knelt next to the 
two, followed closely by the others. &quot;Daijobu desu?&quot; I addressed the 
elf, not quite sure how to call her right now. IF Naru knew, using 
the cover name would sound kind of silly.
	&quot;Hurts... So much...&quot; She drew in a sharp breath. &quot;Hebe...&quot; 
Priapos closed her eyes and for a moment I saw the glamour waver. I 
am not sure anyone noticed but... The moment passed and clenching her 
teeth the elf seemed to get whatever pained her so much under at 
least a bit of reasonable control. She looked up with a grimace of 
pain on her face at our worried expressions. &quot;It&#39;s...&quot; she stopped to 
look at Naru, then seemed to remember that Hitome was here as well 
and trailed off.
	&quot;Ah... I am going to get some water,&quot; Hitome said that very 
moment and was out of the room before anyone could blink.
	Rei stared after her with a peculiar expression on her 
face. &quot;Does everyone around here know?&quot; At everyone&#39;s startled look, 
she sighed in obvious exasperation. &quot;Look it is obvious Naru knows, 
yes?&quot; She fixed Naru with a glance and slowly the auburn-haired girl 
nodded.
	Once again I felt the sensation of shame run through me. 
Shame and disappointment. It didn&#39;t quite matter at the moment how 
she had found out. More important was the question, why she had not 
told me. Had I been this absent and busy that it appeared that I had 
no time at all for my best friend anymore? I quickly pressed down on 
those thoughts though since more immediate things had to be taken 
care of. &quot;Ami?&quot; I asked without looking away from the elf who seemed 
to struggle with her composure and actually had let the glamour fade 
now.
	Ami had gotten out her computer already and after consulting 
it for some time, nodded. &quot;I set an automatic detection for that 
golem. It&#39;s not far from here in the city...&quot;
	&quot;We&#39;d better hurry then,&quot; Luna pointed, deciding to drop the 
charade of being a normal cat as well.
	&quot;But what about...&quot; I protested.
	Priapos was quick to cut in though. &quot;Go, I&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;s 
just an emotional backlash, something upset Hebe... Minako pretty 
much. It&#39;ll pass in a few minutes.&quot; Not that that news helped any to 
relieve my worry. I knew a little about bonding through my link to 
Mamoru, not to mention all of us Senshi shared a close sisterly bond. 
And anything to produce that kind of reaction must be... I cut of my 
thoughts, not wanting to imagine the possibilities right about now.
	Sometimes I hated my duty. However, torn between staying and 
making sure that Priapos was alright, running over and checking on 
Minako and the immediate threat of a golem running wild in the city, 
there was no real contest. As much as it pained me emotionally.
	&quot;Alright, Naru you stay with Priapos, yes?&quot; Naru nodded. I 
put a hand to my broach. &quot;Then let&#39;s go.&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Priapos)
To understand what exactly happened, you ought to know how exactly 
elf bonding worked. There were several different forms how elves 
bonded with each other and with other races. There was the mate 
bonding which was essentially for life. There was virtually no 
separation or, using the human term, divorce possible. That was not 
because it was not approved ethically. No, it was simply not 
necessary. Mate bonds between elves - and any magical races for that 
matter - were an act of harmony as much as fate. For us the concept 
was never much a believe system rather than a fact. When an elf found 
their mate they usually knew and if they bonded it was with the 
knowledge that the other was exactly the right person for them.
	Cross-mating with humans was a little different, simply for 
the fact that mankind wasn&#39;t as bound to the order of the things and 
the nature of creation as we were. There were humans who actually had 
a soul mate, as they called it, and others who might seek that person 
for their whole life without knowing there never was one to begin 
with. Now, under those circumstances it had always been hard to sense 
the familiarity with a human mate even if they might have known each 
other for years.
	But that was rather beside the point. Next to the mate 
bonding, there was the kin bonding. That happened between elves as 
well as between elves and humans... or other races. Kin bonding is 
the highest form of devotion an elf can express for another being 
except mating. Kin bonding makes those who enter it brothers or 
sisters, in every sense you can imagine with the word. The closest 
thing to describe it might be the human terms of blood brother or 
blood sister but that really covered only the surface of the bond.
	The rituals were different for every race and tribe but the 
meaning and the effects were mostly the same. In my case I had 
offered Hebe virtually a part of myself. All nature elves were born 
from nature in a way. No, not like dryads or something. But the 
original elves, the first ones that ever walked Venus&#39; surface were.
	Every tribe since then had a mother spirit, one of the great 
trees only native to Venus and upon birth every elf received a branch 
of their tribe&#39;s guardian, that branch was called a Meshi and held 
part of the guardian&#39;s life energy. It wasn&#39;t like we needed our 
Meshi to live or to do anything special. The Meshi was a link to our 
ancestors, to our heritage. They were what symbolized us as what we 
were. And thus the ritual for kin bonding demanded to give part of 
what you were to the other. The Meshi was separated and sprinkled 
with the blood of both. After that each received and kept one of the 
halves.
	Taking all that into consideration, a kin bonding wasn&#39;t even 
half as much an emotional bonding of spirit, mind and soul than a 
mate bonding was. Kin Sisters, like Hebe and I were, did not feel the 
other&#39;s every emotion or something like that. There was a conscious 
bonding and we could sense the other much better than, say two Senshi 
could normally sense each other. However, it wasn&#39;t like we were 
affected by each other for the most part.
	Therefore, the sudden pain entering my system was as 
unexpected as it was mind-numbing. I had never felt such a searing 
pain crash over our bond as I did in that moment. Everything faded 
into a distant background sound as I felt my heart ache with such 
unbearable pain I thought that I would explode right there on the 
spot. Conscious control over my body and my senses was ripped from me 
like a leaf from a tree under the effect of a hurricane.
	I fought with every bit of control left in me to keep the 
sensations at bay but it wasn&#39;t much use. Such was the nature of a 
kin bonding. If there was an emotional effect - and those could 
really only transfer in the worst of cases - they were pretty much 
not to block. I could feel Hebe&#39;s pain as it was mine. Not a physical 
one but one that went much deeper, much more complex. It was a cry of 
anguish, loss, deep concern and an at least heavily damaged heart.
	And it was more or less over after only a few seconds 
actually. The sensation faded more to a distant dull throbbing, an 
intense concentration and determination overriding the emotional pain 
and pushing it back. I had, however, learned enough already to know 
at least to some extent what was going on and I wanted to cry in 
anguish and loathing to the insensibility and ignorance of those 
people. I had almost anticipated something like that happening but 
had not expected such a drastic outcome...
	Of course, in the midst of it Naru had blown her cover. I had 
heard her call me by name and the curious glances from everyone that 
I could detect when I found some control back were enough to tell me 
I hadn&#39;t imagined it. Not that it mattered much. The younger girl had 
planned on telling Usagi anyway. So, the only thing that slip managed 
was to cause some confusion and maybe hurt feelings.
	I managed to send them off finally. That golem needed to be 
dealt with. I desperately hoped that it was not as freaking powerful 
as those Aura Knights had been. Normally a couple of Senshi would 
easily be able to bring a normal golem down without any problems. If 
it was anything like the Aura Knights had been, though... Well, Venus 
probably wasn&#39;t in any position to help right now and I needed to go 
and find her quickly. I couldn&#39;t leave them alone right now.
	Looking up at a gentle hand on my shoulder, I found myself 
looking into genuinely concerned eyes. &quot;Are you feeling any better 
now?&quot; the auburn-haired girl kneeling beside me asked, one hand 
reaching for my own before she stopped hesitantly, obviously not 
quite sure what to do.
	I smiled and took her hand in mine gently, making my best to 
reassure her. The worry touched me and for the first time I really 
realized that I might have found an actual friend in this time other 
than the Senshi. And that made me instantly feel a little better. &quot;I 
am alright. Arigato, Naru-san.&quot;
	The other girl blinked, startled. &quot;For what?&quot;
	&quot;For being so concerned,&quot; I answered truthfully. &quot;For being 
there for me.&quot;
	&quot;Why would I not? We are friends after all.&quot; She was so much 
like the Princess it was scary sometimes. I could see why they were 
such good friends. While different in a lot of other areas they both 
had a very kind heart. I nodded at her, conveying with my eyes how 
much that meant for me. Naru smiled slightly.
	&quot;Here.&quot; I looked up, having been caught totally off guard. My 
senses had yet to return to full alertness and I had missed the 
reentrance of Rei&#39;s friend, Kanzaki Hitome, who just now offered me a 
glass of water which I accepted with a nod. I didn&#39;t even bother to 
assume my glamour again. There was no real need for that.
	Emptying the glass in one big gulp, I looked at the part-time 
miko - or whatever actually her position here was. &quot;You knew all 
along, didn&#39;t you?&quot; Hitome nodded but didn&#39;t further elaborate. I 
pondered briefly to press the issue but decided to drop it for the 
moment. There were more important things to do and it might be better 
that the girl discussed this with Rei personally first.
	I shook my head and, accepting Naru&#39;s help, managed to stand 
up. I took a moment to get some feeling back into my body. &quot;My sister 
needs me,&quot; I stated. &quot;I really need to go, the faster the better.&quot; I 
shot a pleading look at Naru. I wanted to explain what exactly 
happened since one could still clearly see the worry but I could 
still feel the echoes of my kin sister and her mate now too. It had 
dimmed more to sadness and I was relieved that their bond had 
obviously not been shattered under the confrontation but I still 
NEEDED to be there. &quot;I...&quot;
	Naru cut me off with a shake of her head. &quot;Go. I understand.&quot; 
She hesitated for a moment, then laughed faintly. &quot;At least I think I 
do.&quot;
	Flashing her a grateful smile and nodding to Hitome, I left 
the room and was soon on my way back to Aino-ke.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Artemis)
Logically seen, something like that had to happen sooner or later. 
Even more logical seen something like that almost always happened at 
days there you least expect it...
	I don&#39;t care much about logic.
	All my life at court I had been the guardian and steady 
partner of Venus. Whether Hebe or Minako now. And seeing the 
catastrophe unfold without being able to do at least SOMETHING... It 
hurt. It hurt a lot. Minako meant so much to me and I would do 
anything for her and being limited as I was proved to be painful, 
more than I can put into words.
	Back in the Silver Millennium I could have spoken in the 
presence of everyone. I was Venus&#39; guardian, everybody knew that. 
Heck, I could change to any shape between human and cat that I wanted 
to with not more than a thought. Now I could only watch, being 
chained to keep my superior intelligence that differed Luna and me 
from terran cats a secret. If I just could have acted freely...
	I would have slapped them silly!
	Unfortunately all I could do was call Minako when I 
discovered that her secret relationship wasn&#39;t so secret anymore. And 
of course, the normally so oblivious Ainos had found out the nature 
of her daughter&#39;s relationship to their almost permanent houseguest 
in the WORST possible way.
	Once again I found myself cursing my own laziness even though 
I knew deep down that I probably couldn&#39;t have made any difference at 
all - but my already bruised ego didn&#39;t want to accept that. We had 
all slept in this morning after all and that had been the 
unintentional mistake. Because for once in their life Aino Miyako 
decided to be nosy instead of her usual behavior that was anything 
but. Apparently she had peeked into the room just before the girls 
woke up... or maybe even shortly afterwards, that didn&#39;t become very 
clear. However, I knew how those two could get just after waking up. 
Some physical contact was always there and judged by the elder Aino&#39;s 
reaction, the possibility was becoming more and more likely.
	I had tried to warn Hotaru when I found out but I had been 
out most of the morning and just came in to catch up with Hotaru when 
she came to get Minako&#39;s gift. As I listened into the heated 
discussion figuring out what had transpired, I rushed to intercept 
but unfortunately the timing was again the worst possible.
	Now I sat in a corner, trying my best to look innocent and 
disinterested regarding the events in the living room. Those events 
had come to a complete stop altogether. A vast, thick silence had 
descended... no, more like smashed down on the room, as if the 
ceiling had collapsed, ever since Minako had made her dramatic exit.
	Aino Miyako was standing in the door frame, her hand 
occasionally twitching as if reaching out for her daughter who wasn&#39;t 
there anymore. Satoru had fallen back into his chair with a heavy 
sigh and hadn&#39;t moved since then. However, while his wife seemed more 
like a stature, he seemed to actually be contemplating the situation, 
appearing deep in thought.
	Finally, after a near eternity, Minako&#39;s father stood up and 
walked over to the window which I had been watching for most of the 
time. The window that led to the backyard where Minako and Hotaru 
were. At least that had filled me with immense relief. The emotional 
pain I felt from my partner for a moment was sheer overwhelming and I 
had been on the verge of bolting after them myself but my curiosity 
as to her parents reactions held me back. From what I could see they 
hadn&#39;t moved much for several minutes now, holding each other tightly.
	&quot;I think,&quot; Satoru started, &quot;this didn&#39;t turn out very well.&quot; 
Now THAT was an understatement if I ever heard one! I don&#39;t think 
they had expected that kind of reaction from their daughter at all. 
Seeing as most of the time her age and other things were confused 
anyway that wasn&#39;t very surprising.
	Miyako, obviously roused by her husband&#39;s words, turned 
around, a mixture of conflicting emotions in her word. &quot;How can she 
say those things? We, we are her parents and she is still our baby. 
What could that Tomoe girl possibly give her that a decent boy 
couldn&#39;t?&quot;
	&quot;Like those dozen or so she dated before the summer she went 
to England and came back with Tomoe-san?&quot; The question, which sounded 
more like a statement actually, surprised me probably as much as it 
surprised Minako&#39;s mother whose face reflected a little bit of 
shock. &quot;Look at them.&quot; Aino Satoru hadn&#39;t moved from his place at the 
window and motioned for his wife to come over. Reluctantly she obeyed 
the request and went to stand next to her husband. &quot;Have you ever 
seen anyone that... happy? Especially after what just happened?&quot;
	Minako&#39;s mother wanted to protest, I could almost smell it, 
her lips opened slightly to form words but then swallowed whatever 
she wanted to say. My excellent vision helped me to spot the barely 
visible tears in her eyes before they were blinked away in an act of 
sheer stubbornness. &quot;That still doesn&#39;t excuse what they were 
obviously doing behind our back.&quot;
	&quot;We haven&#39;t been much older, you remember?&quot;
	Now that quite effectively killed any sound in the room for 
another minute or so. I began to reevaluate my opinion of Aino 
Satoru. Quite frankly I had believed that a man with his intellect 
could not be as dense as he sometimes appeared to be and the same 
should go for his wife. I had no idea why they chose to act like they 
do but whatever reason, Minako&#39;s outburst had left a huge crack in 
their possibly self-made delusion and the crack was getting wider 
with any passing moment.
	Miyako never got the chance to reply to the statement as the 
doorbell rang just that very moment. Minako&#39;s father grumbled and 
both adults didn&#39;t make a move to answer it until the bell chimed 
another two times. Getting annoyed, Satoru went to answer it. 
Curious, I jumped down from my place and followed, his wife doing the 
same.
	There was a fairly suspicious-looking man at the door. 
Elegantly glad in a black business suit and with dark sunglasses he 
gave off an air of perfect professionalism. Too perfect. Not to 
mention that I knew these men. Very well actually. I couldn&#39;t help 
the frustrated un-catlike groan as I realized it was one of the men 
who usually came by to pick up Hotaru after she ran away. They were 
obviously employed by the elder Tomoe to do the dirty work. It was a 
pure shame. He wouldn&#39;t even care to show up himself. Not surprising 
though since Hotaru&#39;s possession led to the logical conclusion that 
her father was as much victim as she had been.
	&quot;May I help you? We are busy right now with a family problem, 
can you come by later,&quot; Satoru said but I could see that he had 
suddenly become tense. Obviously he had recognized the man as well. I 
am sure the fates are laughing their old heads off right now at the 
perfect timing of it all. I could care less. The next time I saw 
Pluto I would bring forth a formal protest.
	&quot;It will not take long. I am correct that Tomoe Hotaru is 
currently... in your care?&quot; The man didn&#39;t wait for a confirmation 
but took a step forward. He found his way blocked, however, by the 
other man. &quot;I am here to take her home. Her father wished for her 
return and I am sure you will welcome to be relieved of the bother.&quot; 
The man smirked in a matter that wasn&#39;t really cruel, more uncaring, 
indifferent.
	&quot;I can&#39;t say that Hotaru-san has been a bother lately,&quot; 
Minako&#39;s father surprised once again everyone present with his reply. 
Especially since it was given with a conviction that didn&#39;t indicate 
at all the major fight that had just occurred over the very 
issue. &quot;Also, I wonder why Tomoe-san would not come himself to get 
his daughter. I believe that would be the least a father could do for 
his daughter, yes? Then again, that probably is why she ran away so 
often.&quot;
	The man lifted his glasses slightly and narrowed his eyes. &quot;I 
do not think that is your business, Aino-san. Tomoe Souichi is a busy 
man who has a lot of work to do and he is worried about his wayward 
daughter which is why I am here now. So if you would please...&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t think I can live with myself if I pushed Hotaru-san 
back into an obviously unstable and uncaring family.&quot; At this point 
his wife was about ready to say something while I looked on calmly, 
very interested in the turn this whole event had suddenly taken. 
Satoru held up a hand to silence his wife and after a moment she 
stepped back looking torn between stubbornness, anger and resignation.
	The other man was ready to explode any moment, I could tell, 
but surprisingly enough Minako&#39;s father didn&#39;t seem to be worried at 
all. I wondered where he found the calm until I remembered his former 
profession. &quot;I ask you one last time to let me take Tomoe-san home. 
She is still underage and you can be charged for your uncooperative 
behavior.&quot;
	Aino Satoru stared at the man with an unreadable expression 
and then softly spoke, &quot;Maybe. But are YOU willing to risk it. I have 
studied law and while it might have been awhile ago that I had to use 
my knowledge I am certain that it is in Tomoe-san&#39;s best interest 
that this situation is not to be made official.&quot; At the dangerous 
glare he received, Satoru merely blinked and actually relaxed, arms 
crossed. &quot;I do read the paper, sir. I know how the public already 
thinks about Tomoe Labs. Your boss has been kicked out of the 
association already. Are you really willing to risk a public trial. 
Even if you would win, this would almost certainly cause 
investigations, reporters and of course, in the eye of the public a 
lot of people would declare you at fault, albeit what the court 
decided.&quot;
	The man froze, standing there totally motionless. His 
expression went from confusion to shock, to anger, to shock again and 
finally to a trapped look that clearly indicated that this kind of 
publicity and hassle was certainly not in his boss&#39; interest. Not 
surprisingly since we already considered them enemies and an exposure 
to the public in their obviously still fresh stage could cause a lot 
of unwanted problems.
	&quot;Here is what we do,&quot; Minako&#39;s father said and his tone bode 
a finality that made the other man flinch. &quot;Hotaru-san will stay with 
us as long as she wishes to and you can tell her father that he may 
permit us full custody for the time being. If he chooses to refuse or 
wishes to bring this matter to court, which I don&#39;t believe, he can 
do this. Sayonara, kind sir.&quot; He gave the man a little push and 
closed the door before he could even utter a reply.
	As soon as the door was closed Aino Satoru&#39;s posture slumped 
and he let out a weary sigh. Turning around to face his wife, the two 
adults looked at each other for several moments before breaking eye 
contact and walking back into the living room to take their spot on 
the window again. Minako and Hotaru were gone.
	&quot;Where are...?&quot; Minako&#39;s mother started but was stopped by 
the hand of her husband on her shoulder.
	&quot;We have done a lot of damage today. Our little girl isn&#39;t so 
little anymore. She&#39;s become almost a woman already. I think we 
didn&#39;t want to accept that but now we must. If we don&#39;t...&quot; He 
trailed off, letting the sentence hang in the air like a Damocles 
sword.
	Miyako stood silently next to her husband, her eyes fixed on 
the bench where her daughter and her girlfriend had sat a few minutes 
ago, escaping from their actions. I could see the last bit of 
stubbornness melt away and giving way to tears as I slipped out of 
the room. The last I saw was Satoru taking his wife in his arms.
	I had seen enough and maybe telling Minako of what had 
transpired after they left might make the healing a little easier. I 
wasn&#39;t under the delusion that healing the deep wound that had been 
created would be an easy task but I had seen that the parents were 
willing and I knew that despite her understandable reaction Minako 
still loved her family.
	Right now I suspected that I was needed elsewhere. Most 
certainly that golem was loose. Luna had me informed earlier the day 
and I could feel the hairs on my neck tingling with the presence of 
evil not far from here. Of course our enemies had to choose this day 
to send their next monster. I would most certainly make this file 
this protest. With a formal document, signature and all...

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mamoru)
Dodging another wild swing I tried to desperately put some distance 
between myself and the towering figure weighting several tons of 
surely crushing force. I had to hit the ground suddenly and only a 
moment later the air produced by the swing of the giant fist blew up 
my cape and would surely have decapitated me if I hadn&#39;t reacted fast 
enough. Using the little time I gained by the successful evasion I 
rolled to one side, sprang up onto my hands and then backwards 
several times before I finally came to rest a respectful distance 
away.
	&quot;That was a very smart idea,&quot; I muttered darkly. How exactly 
I had gotten it into my head to take on that thing all by myself was 
beyond me right now, not that I had much time to think about it. I 
had been on my way to the Jinja, finished with my classes for today 
and having taken the day off of work to attend the party when I 
literally ran into the somewhere above thirty feet tall stone 
monster. The talk with my former Guardians had woken a lot of old 
memories and I had identified it right away as a Jupiter-native 
golem. That hadn&#39;t helped me very much though since the thing was 
running wild in the city, directly on the main street. I glanced back 
at my - brand-new - car and sighed. I just hoped my insurance covered 
complete destruction through golems...
	Well, there was the reason for me being there. I hadn&#39;t had 
much choice other than to transform and defend myself, rather poorly, 
I admit. The thick stone skin was as expected practically impossible 
to break. Roses were out of the question and the Smoking Bomber I 
tried had only the effect of annoying the beast which in turn made me 
the sole focus of its attack.
	Assessing the situation I knew that I was in deep trouble. 
One blow would probably chain me to a hospital bed for several weeks 
even with my natural healing... if I was lucky. Of course, with its 
size the Golem was slow but still fast enough to make dodging a hard 
task in itself. Counter-attacking was as successful as trying to 
wrestle with a grizzly. So what to do?
	I didn&#39;t have much more time to think about it as the golem 
roared. I felt the charged air and didn&#39;t need to look in order to 
know something major was coming. The unintelligent seeming eyes of 
the creature suddenly flashed a jade green that spoke of unrestrained 
fury. Taken aback by the unexpected occurrence I barely managed to 
move before the golem thrust his arms forward and a sphere of darkish-
green launched from its palms.
	&quot;What the...?&quot; I cursed myself for not being more prepared 
for this. We were dealing with a very resourceful enemy after all, 
something the Aura Knight episode had shown. Our foes had proved 
stronger than expected every time and so it should be only natural to 
assume the same thing now... This insight came to late though.
	&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;
	I threw up my cape to shield myself as the fiery bird 
suddenly crashed through the incoming attack, making both explode. 
The resulting shockwave lifted me up into the air and several feet 
through it before I crashed down again in a not exactly gentle manner.
	&quot;Wrecking havoc in the middle of our city, we won&#39;t allow 
that!&quot; I could hear Usako&#39;s voice ringing out over the faded sound of 
the explosion. I glanced up, some spots still dancing before my eyes 
since I hadn&#39;t have enough time to shield myself properly. Moon, 
Mercury, Mars and Jupiter were standing on the remaining part of what 
was once a small bridge built over the street. &quot;Ai to seign no! 
Sailor-fuku Bishoujo Senshi, Sailormoon!&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t think it is intelligent enough to understand you,&quot; 
Mars interrupted and Moon, as expected, glowered at her friend. I 
wasn&#39;t too sure about the not being intelligent part anymore but had 
not much time to express my opinion on the matter. The golem 
obviously DID hear them or maybe it simply reacted to Mars&#39; 
counterattack. Either way, without even bothering to make a sound I 
could practically see the insane fury in its eyes rising even more. 
Bringing one fist down onto the pavement, the ground shook violently 
and I had the presence of mind to evacuate the lower battle areas as 
did the Senshi. That proved to be a very good thing since only a 
moment later the ground split up as if someone had sliced with a 
sharp knife through a piece of paper, sending debris flying 
everywhere.
	&quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot;
	I was surprised that the glowing disc of lightning actually 
managed to stagger the golem a bit, obviously it had hit upon a weak 
spot. But staggering was all the attack did and soon we all had to 
move again as the golem rushed into our already disorientated 
formation and took wild, unpredictable swings. Moon tried to hurl her 
tiara at it but was forced to break off the attack as she staggered 
back under a sudden assault in her direction. With a couple of quick 
leaps I was at her side and had picked her up. Unfortunately I had 
once again underestimated the, for the creature&#39;s size, rather fast 
swings and realized too late that I wouldn&#39;t have time to move again 
before...
	&quot;SHABON SPRAY!&quot;
	Then again, maybe I had enough time. Thankful that the golem 
was apparently confused enough to not simply follow through with the 
attack I quickly retreated backwards, instinctively knowing where the 
others would be. Another part of Venus and Priapos&#39; rigorous training 
and right now I was very thankful for that.
	&quot;Any bright ideas, minna,&quot; Mars asked a bit out of breath 
from being forced to such a display of agility. &quot;I don&#39;t think we can 
hold up with dodging forever.&quot;
	I glanced at Moon, not oblivious to the troubled and a little 
distracted expression on her face. I couldn&#39;t favor what put it there 
but there was no time for that now. Gently squeezing her hand I was 
rewarded with a small smile before her expression turned serious 
again.
	&quot;Didn&#39;t you say one or two Senshi should easily be able to 
handle a golem?&quot; she directed her question at Luna who had joined us 
in the fog.
	&quot;I wasn&#39;t talking about over thirty feet tall ones that 
actually seem to be able to fire magical blasts. This is definitely 
an artificial Golem. Correct me if I am wrong, Jupiter, but to my 
knowledge they are quite lifeless and don&#39;t possess a spirit to draw 
magic from.&quot;
	Jupiter nodded at Luna&#39;s comment, appearing deep in thought 
even though keeping a close eye on her surroundings. It was Mercury 
who answered. &quot;From what I can see this one is clearly animated. 
There is no magical signature at all.&quot; She frowned at her computer 
before tugging it away and looking helpless. &quot;I have no idea how it 
was able to do that.&quot; Seeing Mercury helpless usually produced the 
unbidden sensation of impending doom. Where the hell was Venus 
anyway, she usually knew what to...
	The train of thought was interrupted as an inhuman growl 
broke through the fog and it wasn&#39;t very far away. Everyone whirled 
around to see the golem break through the mist, blindly smashing the 
ground or punching the air. Jupiter narrowed her eyes. &quot;This is 
definitely a Jupiter design. Even though, as Luna said, they are more 
resistant to water, it is still a natural weakness. Mercury, wait for 
an opportunity!&quot; Nodding at Mars and Moon, the three broke off into 
different directions closing in on the golem from different angles.
	&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;
	&quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot;
	&quot;FIRE SOUL!&quot;
	I hung back a second and then launched my own attack before 
the smoke had fully cleared.
	&quot;TUXEDO SMOKING BOMBER!&quot; As I focused my energy I fueled the 
attack with even more energy than on my previous try. Talking with my 
former friends had helped me to understand my power a little better.
	Mercury behind me waited for a second more after the 
concussive blast smashed against where the head most likely was and 
then shouted out her own attack. &quot;SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;
	The steady beam of water crashed against the huge golem, his 
size making it hard to miss. Moon, Mars and Jupiter joined us again 
and we watched in anticipation as the golem howled under the assault. 
I was just about to suggest another attack and for Moon to stay ready 
to blast it to pieces when another unexpected thing happened. The 
creature&#39;s eyes narrowed suddenly and I could see tiny spark dance 
over its body, almost like...
	&quot;Take cover!&quot;
	The warning came too late as without warning electricity 
raced down Mercury&#39;s own attack with the force of a thunderbolt...

(Hotaru)
I don&#39;t know how long exactly we sat there, holding each other. It 
could have been hours but probably was not more than a few minutes. I 
wasn&#39;t sure and quite frankly I didn&#39;t care at all. The feeling of 
belonging was simply too strong to ever want to leave again. This was 
where I needed to be, always. This was where home was, regardless of 
families and friends. In her arms I would always be home, no matter 
where we were, who we were and what was happening around us.
	When I felt Minako finally pull away after a small eternity 
the feeling of loss was only a short sensation before I felt her 
hands cupping my face. I looked and thought I would forever be lost 
in the blue eyes so full of devotion and unconditional love. I really 
didn&#39;t deserve her but there was no going back now. If we learned 
something out of the events from this day it was that. We couldn&#39;t be 
without each other.
	&quot;It is scary sometimes, isn&#39;t it?&quot; I blinked at Minako&#39;s 
words not fully understanding. She smiled softly and it seemed like 
the shadows of the backyard were actually retreating. &quot;That we can 
feel that strong. That we can love and need each other so much that 
it becomes almost painful. We haven&#39;t known each other for that long, 
but still...&quot;
	I put a finger on her lips before leaning in and capturing 
her lips with mine, raveling in the sensation of the sweetest of 
touches. That was something I had come to love ever since the first 
kiss Hebe gave me on the fair. Somehow Minako had learned to do it 
and to be kissed by the Senshi of Love was... You just couldn&#39;t 
describe it with words. I pulled away slightly after a long while of 
slow, sensual contact. &quot;Does it matter? You told me yourself love 
knows no time nor reason. We should not question our fates.&quot;
	Minako didn&#39;t respond just kissed me again and I felt that if 
I had been standing my legs would have given way underneath me. In a 
way her words rang very true. I had never felt so strongly when I did 
right now. All the time I was with Minako actually, but especially 
right this moment, everything was even more pronounced and stronger. 
That was scary in a way but at the same time it made me simply not 
care. There was nothing bad about this, so why worry? Right now, I 
thought that nothing could shatter that peace that had settled over 
us...
	Minako&#39;s communicator beeped.
	Well, maybe ONE thing could...
	We parted and looked at each other, the beeping noise of her 
watch becoming a distant background sensation... A grin began to 
creep into my mate&#39;s face and I couldn&#39;t hold the smile any longer. 
Finally we broke out into laughter and I could feel the last bit of 
tension created by the earlier confrontation pouring out of me like a 
waterfall.
	&quot;We,&quot; I gasped out, between bits of laughter, trying to calm 
myself, &quot;shouldn&#39;t laugh about this... Could be... serious...&quot; I took 
several deep breaths and giggled again before settling down.
	Minako nodded, managing to control her laughter as well. &quot;You 
are right. We better go check this out.&quot; She clicked open her watch 
and frowned at failing to get a response. &quot;This is bad. They probably 
rushed right in and now they are getting in trouble again.&quot; Shaking 
her hand, she pressed a button. A mini-map of Tokyo shimmered into 
view in form of a hologram. A need little thing Ami had implanted 
into the new communicators. There was a cluster of colored dots in 
one spot, indicating the position of the other Senshi - or at least 
the signal their own communicators were sending.
	&quot;This is rather far away from here.&quot; I said, trying to gauge 
the distance from here to what was apparently somewhere on the main 
street that ran along both Usagi&#39;s home and Chiba-san&#39;s apartment 
complex. Aino-ke was located far more north and I knew Minako&#39;s was 
complaining sometimes that she was so far away from the main city 
complex of Azabu-Juuban.
	Minako glanced around and then up to the windows of the 
house, a bit reluctantly as I couldn&#39;t help noticing. &quot;Well, I better 
hurry then.&quot; Pulling out her pen, she proceeded to transform right on 
the spot, stepping just slightly into a corner. &quot;VENUS STAR POWER, 
MAKE UP!&quot; I felt myself blushing as I watched the familiar 
transformation. The whole thing was still a miracle for me, something 
mystical and beautiful that couldn&#39;t be explained rationally. Not to 
mention that I could see my girlfriend naked for a split moment! 
Really, if I hadn&#39;t known what to look for from experience you 
probably wouldn&#39;t see anything you shouldn&#39;t, the process was too 
fast for that.
	Venus had caught my gaze obviously and winked. She hesitated 
for a moment, then held out her hand. &quot;Shall we?&quot; I know she wouldn&#39;t 
have asked normally and it had to take a lot of willpower on her 
part. Minako was fiercely protective of me, I knew, but even without 
out our shared thoughts earlier I had always understood why. However, 
right now I didn&#39;t want to be separated from her, not even for a 
short time. And I surely didn&#39;t want to stay here. And she seemed to 
be as opposed to the thought as I was.
	Smiling I took her hand and soon I found the wind rushing 
past us, pulling on our hairs and clothing as Venus raced over the 
rooftops towards the location of battle. I was a helpless victim for 
the rush of excitement and adrenaline in her arms but didn&#39;t mind the 
sensations one bit. Once again I marveled at the strength and grace 
of my chosen mate. In this form she often seemed to be a totally 
different person even though I knew her and Hebe were as closely 
joined as none of the other Senshi had achieved yet. Still, seeing 
her move, feeling that powerful arms wrapped around me, Venus seemed 
every bit the otherworldly warrior she was.
	Halfway to our destination the problem the other Senshi were 
facing became all too clear to us since it was impossible to miss the 
huge figure from afar and the destruction wrought in the battle. 
Priapos and Artemis joined us shortly afterwards, the latter had been 
picked up by the elf and from the looks of it had obviously informed 
her about what happened at Aino-ke earlier. There were a few looks 
traded but no words spoken, neither from the cat, the elf or one of 
us. But there wasn&#39;t really a need to be. I knew if it came down to 
it, my real family were those four. My mate, her guardian and the elf 
who had become every bit a sister to me as she was to Minako.
	Quietly we made our way towards the battlefield.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Jupiter)
There had been times in the last weeks I had really hated that 
lightning rod in my tiara. Sometimes I did have nightmares about D-
Point and the experience of having several thousand volts of raw, 
natural lightning mixed with magical, youma-infested ones racing 
through your body and tearing you apart. There were, however, times I 
could bless the little thing... Just like the moment the electricity 
came barreling down Mercury&#39;s attack. If the counter had impacted 
with full might I&#39;m not sure if we had survived it, at least we would 
have been unconscious by now. The lightning rod, however, managed to 
take most of it and the rest was just a little staggering.
	Not that surviving this surprising onslaught had brought us 
closer to beating the golem. Whatever we threw at it did little but 
annoy the creature and the wild, uncontrolled attack style kept us on 
our toes and unable to form a decent tactic again. We were acting 
like an amateur in martial arts would. Something along the lines of 
stupid thinking as offense is the best way to beat an opponent. We 
were uncoordinated and the golem didn&#39;t let us breathe longer than a 
couple of seconds to regroup. Simply put, without Venus, we were lost.
	I never had seen it like that but ever since our reawakening 
Venus had been every bit the leader my dim memories said she had been 
for the Inner Senshi in the Silver Millennium. Training as well as 
fighting was done within that concept and everyone seemed to have 
accepted that. Venus had the most experience off of all of us and she 
was more in tune with her past as well. It was true after all, an 
army without a leader was destined to fail.
	If I just could remember why the heck I thought that I should 
recognize the golem&#39;s style! Not only the fighting style, I mean. 
That was a lot like the Aura Knights actually, even though you could 
clearly see that despite its new tricks a golem was never designed to 
be intelligent. No, it was also the way it was built, the structure 
and very essence. I could swear it wasn&#39;t a natural one but when how 
could it produce magic without a spirit? Elemental magic at that! I 
felt that I should know the answer but, damn it, whatever my past 
life knew she was blocking fiercely.
	Sprinting into a run I tried to blindside the golem while it 
was focusing on the others. My lightning had as much effect on it as 
a pencil would have on an elephant, so I had to try something 
different. Gathering my chi I channeled the spiritual energies into 
my palms as I had been taught, creating a sphere of swirling red-
purplish energy. Jumping, I took to the air to get a clear shot at 
one of the weak points my vague memories let me remember... and had 
thrust the chi blast downward by instinct as the Golem suddenly 
whirled on me. That proved to be a good thing because I probably 
would have crashed flat against the next wall if the momentum hadn&#39;t 
carried me over the swing. Twisting my body I managed to barely find 
a wall to bounce off from and then back down to the ground.
	When I landed things had gone from worse to catastrophic. 
Somehow the rest of our group had gotten scattered all over the place 
now, not even remotely close too each other. I wanted to shout out a 
warning when I saw the golem move in on Mars who was on the ground 
but realized it was too late. A helpless fury began to fill me, 
washing away my self-control. If I could just remember...!
	&quot;Hotaru, no!&quot; I caught the movement actually before the shout 
came and I balked as I saw Minako&#39;s girlfriend rush in front of Mars. 
What the heck was she thinking?! My shock turned into stunned 
surprise though as the golem who had his massive fist already cocked 
back for a devastating blow... froze.
	I really cannot describe it any better. There was a sudden 
rush of... fear reflecting in his eyes? That was totally absurd since 
I knew golems were prone to such emotions if made artificially. What 
the hell could scare a mindless creature like that? It looked almost 
terrified for the barest of moments. My gaze snapped back to Hotaru, 
trying to find any clue. This had happened before when we though the 
Youma at the Fruit Parlor. I hadn&#39;t paid it much mind then, 
speculating the appearance of the Moon Staff had something to do with 
it but... Whatever happened had obviously done so while I was focused 
on the golem&#39;s reaction.
	And suddenly the stunned silence was broken. &quot;VENUS WINK-
CHAIN SWORD!&quot; Venus jumped into the scene, Venus Tear blazing as a 
golden blade of energy slammed into the stunned golem sending it 
tumbling a bit. &quot;Really, can&#39;t I let you take care of something 
without me for once?&quot; Our leader&#39;s words seemed to snap everyone out 
their daze. It was like someone had hit the &quot;Play&quot; button. Everything 
seemed to click and fall into place suddenly.
	Mars who a moment ago seemed to be paralyzed as if she had a 
seen the devil himself suddenly jumped up. Pushing Hotaru behind her, 
who by now seemed have realized the foolish thing she had done, Mars&#39; 
eyes narrowed at the golem. Flames began to twirl around her body 
like an angry cobra. &quot;MARS SNAKE FIRE!&quot; A tornado of fire began to 
engulf the Golem making it trash wildly even though the flames didn&#39;t 
seem to hurt it very much. I was just about to ask what this was 
supposed to achieve when Mars turned her head and called 
out, &quot;Mercury!&quot;
	I could have slapped myself silly. The golem seemed to have 
abilities similar to the natural ones on Jupiter. But even if, 
repeatedly heating and cooling the rock skin would take its toll. I 
said they were more resistant not invulnerable. Mercury seemed to 
have caught on as well. She had been reluctant to use her elemental 
powers again after the counterattack but as soon as Mars retreated 
her fire a galloon of water smashed into the golem, giving it no time 
to react.
	Unfortunately all the dual attacks did was exhaust Mercury 
and Mars to the point of collapse. The onslaught did weaken the Golem 
but not nearly enough that Moon could take it down. I wasn&#39;t sure if 
her scepter worked on it at all. This wasn&#39;t a dark entity, a spirit 
or something other that could be healed or hurt by her light... 
powers...
	Obviously my past life had decided that she couldn&#39;t hide 
anymore. Memories flashed through my mind. Of a man, somewhere far in 
my past&#39;s past. Of that more cruel than even remotely close to 
endearing smile. The obsession in his eyes. The countless battles for 
dominance and for the sake of my own sanity. His methodical, cold 
demeanor, not actually evil but repelling. A master of fighting he 
had been among other things. Things like creating artificial 
creatures far more complex, honed and dangerous as anyone else could. 
Among them golems.
	ATLAS
	I broke into a run, rushing right for the golem, pushing away 
the unpleasant pictures and sensations that my past self had so 
desperately tried to hide and shy away from. At the same time I 
cursed myself for not thinking of this earlier. I remembered HIM 
dimly, I had while fighting the Aura Knight as something as an 
unconscious reaction in the heat of battle. Surely their enhancement 
had to be his doing as well. It made all so much sense now... But 
that could be dealt with later.
	Ignoring the shouts of my comrades I pulled every bit of chi 
and magic I could manage together. As I jumped this time I didn&#39;t go 
for an obvious weak point, instead it had to seem for the others like 
I was rushing the thing head on. I bet Sensei never thought I&#39;d use 
that technique THAT way, I thought grimly as I drew back my hands for 
my newest standard attack. &quot;SPARKLING...&quot; I really, really hoped I 
would be right or I would have set me up for a world of pain. Instead 
of gathering the lightning I forced it into my right hand until 
little bolts crackled over the fabric of glove. Aiming at the massive 
chest area it appeared as if I would strike randomly when in reality 
my chi-sight let me find that one thing I desperately hoped to find. 
Thrusting out my hand I finished the attack born out of sheer 
improvising. &quot;... TENKETSU!&quot;
	I had to smile grimly as upon contact the golem began to 
crack at first, lightning racing over its body parts before bursting 
into several tiny splinters rushing past me like a violent storm of 
tiny, sharp needles. A good thing that fuku had a better protection 
than any earth-made armor.
	As I looked back, twisting my body in an effort not to be hit 
too often I saw what I had expected to see. A misty form of pitch-
blackness hovered in the spot where the golem had been, green, 
unearthly eyes drawn to slits in anger but also surprise over what 
had just happened. &quot;Shadow Ghoul,&quot; I mumbled... One of Atlas&#39; 
favorite toys... I grinned to myself. That was where the magic came 
from but the golem itself had still been an inanimate object. 
Therefore it had a natural breaking point.
	&quot;Sailormoon!&quot; I called out in the general direction of where 
I thought the rest were.
	Fortunately Moon had obviously been prepared to use her staff 
already and had it already in her hands and in the space of a mere 
moment aimed at the ghoul spirit. &quot;MOON PRINCESS HALATION!&quot;

It was about half an hour later that we had managed to all gather in 
the Fruit Parlor to unwind. Some of us had to be treated, nothing 
major just scrape wounds and a little charred flesh from the 
electricity. All in all we had gotten away easier than in some of the 
last major battles. However, none of was oblivious to the fact that 
something Luna said one or two Senshi could deal with easily, gave us 
a run for our money until Venus showed up. Until her and Hotaru 
showed up that is.
	I had, quite frankly, no freaking idea what exactly happened, 
but I had an idea of what I had felt. That aura in the brief moment 
where Hotaru had shielded me, the distinctive sense of familiarity 
but yet unable to define exactly what it was that I felt. The 
sensation had been like a cold hand sliding down my spine, a vague 
sense of death and finality had overcome me.
	A few days ago I would have been freaked out and trying to 
pursue the nature of exactly who Tomoe Hotaru was. I would have done 
readings, I would have confronted Minako who obviously knew... 
something. I would have done a lot that I wasn&#39;t willing to do now.
	Tomoe Hotaru HAD saved my life. I wasn&#39;t sure why or how. 
Right now I didn&#39;t exactly care though. And if my training as both a 
miko and a Senshi had taught me one thing, it was that whatever power 
was at work inside Hotaru, it might be tainted and dark but it was 
obviously on our side. Simply following my upbringing, the Shinto 
religion believed in the good in every person and would have treated 
every seemingly dark spirit as a disease. However, being a Senshi had 
shown me that not always being of otherworldly nature meant being 
evil. Nephrite was a wonderful example. He had fallen in love with 
Naru even though he was still controlled. There had been no 
indication that the control had broken and still...
	I resolved silently to thank the younger girl for what it was 
worth and hoped that my reactions of the past weeks hadn&#39;t totally 
destroyed the basis for a good friendship. There was no evil in 
Hotaru, just something I didn&#39;t quite understand and maybe I simply 
didn&#39;t WANT to understand. Minako, who once again showed that we were 
only at best under her lead, obviously trusted her and whatever was 
there inside of the younger girl, and if she could I would very well 
have to do the same. And I had already decided for myself that my ill 
feelings of late had not primarily something to do with those two as 
a couple.
	I sighed. Better to get that over with. I tapped my glass, 
calling attention to me. Not that that was hard since everyone was 
silent right now, trying to catch their breath from all the unplanned 
activity. &quot;Before we start recapitulating, I wanted to say 
something.&quot; Everyone looked from their drinks. &quot;I...&quot; I swallowed, 
pride warring against the need to get this cleared up. Ami was right. 
The time for hiding was over. I had made my decision and I needed to 
get this fully out of my system to concentrate on other things 
again. &quot;I want to apologize to everyone.&quot; Catching Minako and 
Hotaru&#39;s eyes in my gaze for a moment I smiled faintly. &quot;Especially 
to both of you. I have really not been myself.&quot;
	&quot;Rei-chan, it&#39;s alright, we all were in a lot of...&quot; Usagi 
started but I held up a hand, cutting her off.
	Nodding to Ami I went on. &quot;This had nothing to do with Senshi 
business or school. You see a couple of months ago, I had an offer 
from a reckoned studio that searched for young talents to support and 
promote. Obviously I caught their interest through my organizing of 
our local school festival and the few songs I sang there. It... was 
quite a surprise.&quot;
	I looked around, waiting for reactions, but everyone was 
silent, listening quietly. I sighed again and dropped my gaze. &quot;Then 
I became Mars again and everything just happened too fast. I wasn&#39;t 
sure what to do. I had worked for this chance for months and well, I 
guess I wasn&#39;t quite ready to give up. I know for certain that I HAD 
a good chance there...&quot;
	&quot;Rei-chan...&quot; Usagi whispered. She was sitting next to me 
with Mamoru and reached out to touch my hand.
	I caught her hand in my mine and fixed her with a firm, yet 
gentle gaze. I knew what she was going to say and I would have none 
of it. &quot;No, Usagi. Don&#39;t you realize. None of us is ever going to 
leave your side as long as you need us. For us it is not only duty 
but because you are our best friend as well.&quot; I swallowed. Showing 
emotions like this never was my strong point but the need to express 
myself and all the feelings I had tried to ignore over the last weeks 
were threatening to erupt if I didn&#39;t let them out. &quot;We know you 
wanted us to be normal girls. But, for me - and I&#39;m sure for all of 
us - something just wasn&#39;t right during the time we forgot about 
being Senshi.&quot; Leaning in, I added with a quiet whisper, &quot;And I will 
never let you get hurt ever again if I can help it.&quot; Sitting back I 
pulled up my emotional shields again, feeling rather relieved. &quot;So 
don&#39;t think you are getting away from us so easily, Odango Atama,&quot; I 
teased.
	Usagi sat there for several seconds, her mouth working 
silently as if trying to form words. Then, after several moments, a 
small smile tugged on her lips and she squeezed my hand before 
letting go.
	&quot;What made you decide?&quot; Ami&#39;s voice drew my attention back to 
the others. I noted that there was not very much surprise over the 
revelation even from those I was sure hadn&#39;t known. What I found was 
more sympathy and understanding. And that helped immensely. I had 
been a real bitch lately and I would have deserved a more negative 
reaction. At the same time, however, I knew it wouldn&#39;t come.
	&quot;All of you did,&quot; I said, looking out of the window, my mind 
drifting a little. Fighting the golem had called something back into 
my mind that I had always treated as a given ever since I met my 
fellow Senshi. &quot;What if I hadn&#39;t been there today to weaken the golem 
with Ami?&quot; Would Makoto still have been able to do what she did? 
Maybe, maybe not. But the question did not really need an answer. It 
wasn&#39;t designed for that purpose. Looking back at the other three I 
saw my own feelings reflected just as I had expected and I knew that 
I didn&#39;t need to elaborate further. We were a team. Only together 
could our individual strengths be an unstoppable force. Alone we were 
strong but in the end still helpless. That had always been the 
purpose and strength of the Inner Senshi. Leaving them, even if with 
their approval, would have ultimately made me feel like I betrayed 
them. I knew they would never think that way about it but that 
wouldn&#39;t change the fact that I would forever blame myself if 
something happened and I could have been there. Never again did I 
want to feel like I did at D-Point. So hopeless and a failure to my 
duty AND my friends.
	&quot;I think we all learned something from today&#39;s battle,&quot; Luna 
spoke up but had to pause when Unazuki brought a new drink for 
Usagi. &quot;You all have grown up a lot and you have become much 
stronger. I am not sure if you would have been able to handle all 
that happened lately when you were still fighting Beryl. But now, I 
think, whoever our enemies are together you will be able to overcome 
them eventually,&quot; she continued and then added softly, &quot;without any 
sacrifices this time.&quot;
	Getting a praise from Luna is a rare thing which is why 
everyone smiled at the cat&#39;s words. I doubt she really could fool 
anyone that she was the stern advisor she always pretended to be. I 
believe that if it came down to it Luna wished us a normal life 
probably as much as Usagi did.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Luna)
What I just said was the truth but at the same time it might have 
been an attempt of comfort for myself. As much as I wished to deny 
the results from the network, I knew that there was more than just a 
distant possibility of truth behind them. And that had me deeply 
unsettled. I had not yet shared my findings with Artemis, maybe 
because that would make it any more real. After all it was just a 
reading, a very unreliable one. It could have been a lure or a trap, 
maybe our enemy had already tapped into the network and was feeding 
us false information. As frightening as the thought seemed I would 
almost prefer it over the information I had gathered.
	&quot;Speaking of our enemies,&quot; Makoto spoke up and my head 
immediately snapped up to look at her, &quot;I think I remembered now what 
I couldn&#39;t before.&quot; I had hoped it had been something like that which 
made her take action the way she did. Especially with her recent 
behavior, I would have not expected a reckless attack from her.
	Makoto waited for a couple of seconds and it was easy to tell 
how uncomfortable whatever memory the battle had dug up made her. I 
almost wanted to tell her it could wait, give her time to deal with 
it first, but I knew that could prove disastrous. Today&#39;s battle had 
been tougher than I had suspected, even if I expected an enemy 
enhanced beyond what we expected, and time was running out. After the 
Aura Knight incident already it had become clear that SOMETHING had 
to be done and not being able to find any clues whatsoever galled me 
and everyone else.
	Minako, who sat next to Makoto, touched the brunette&#39;s 
shoulder at her continuing silence. &quot;Mako-chan?&quot;
	Makoto sighed even though her face was seemingly calm. I had 
to marvel at the self-control since the subject was clearly causing 
her trouble. &quot;When I grew up on Jupiter, there was a man there who 
had an almost animal obsession towards me. Atlas was... a very strong-
willed man from Callisto. He had quickly risen to the rank of Admiral 
in our planetary armies at a young age. His ruthless and cold tactics 
that often demanded a lot of sacrifices for victory were feared. One 
day he pushed too far and got several of his best men unnecessarily 
killed. He was striped of his rank and exiled.&quot;
	Makoto... no, Jupiter looked up at the ceiling, her tone 
becoming distant. &quot;We had been friends once. But his friendship 
quickly turned into obsession. He thought that only he as the 
strongest warrior of the planet should have the right to be with the 
future Jupiter. Despite his great strength he had never been able to 
beat me in actual combat and soon began to be obsessed by the thought 
that if we beat me he would... owe me.&quot; The last words were almost 
spat.
	&quot;You were friends with someone like that?&quot; Usagi asked, 
obviously not able to grasp the concept. Now that the name was 
mentioned I remembered hearing about the man but never really 
realized that he would have had deep ties with the Senshi of Jupiter.
	Makoto laughed, the sound more sad than bitter. &quot;He was a 
good man once. We sort of grew up together and before he began his 
military career, he wasn&#39;t that bad. The power corrupted him, I 
suppose, to a point where I wasn&#39;t able to reach him anymore at all. 
When I came to the Moon as a Senshi, I was relieved to finally have 
left him behind...&quot; I could tell the version was slightly edited but 
that was only to understandable. There must have been a lot of bad 
blood between them and I didn&#39;t think Jupiter would leave out any 
necessary details.
	&quot;What makes you think he is behind this?&quot; asked Artemis and I 
nodded in agreement. As I said I remembered reading a bit about him 
but... it was still rather blurry.
	&quot;Atlas has not only been a formidable warrior but also a 
master craftsman for golems and similar artificial tools. As long as 
they were able to be used for warfare he could do a lot of things 
with them. The kind we encountered today was an animated golem, but 
it was powered with a Shadow Ghoul spirit. Something akin to a Youma 
but it cannot materialize physically in this world. Atlas found a way 
to use the ghoul spirit&#39;s essence as a conduct to enhance the 
artificial golems magically.&quot;
	Everyone blinked at that and traded confused looks, except 
Ami and Hotaru who seemed to have comprehended the information easily 
and nodded. Well, I couldn&#39;t blame them. Makoto was so full of 
surprises lately, I hadn&#39;t expected to hear something that analytical 
detailed. However, it was clear that was more Jupiter than Makoto 
speaking.
	Minako seemed thoughtful ever since Jupiter had begun 
relating her tale about Atlas and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder what she 
was thinking about. True, both Hotaru and her had been VERY subdued 
ever since we left the battleground and they were practically 
clinging to each other with a force I hadn&#39;t see them do before. 
Fortunately everyone had the sense to not comment on this and I 
wasn&#39;t about to make the day even more miserable by prying. But 
Minako&#39;s current concentration seemed to be about something different.
	As if she had been reading my mind, Minako looked up. &quot;This 
is rather coincidental after all.&quot; At the questioning looks turned in 
her directions, she continued, &quot;First I ran into Adonis. Now Mako-
chan thinks that one of her... ex-pursuers was behind this attack and 
maybe some of the earlier ones. If I understand that Atlas has been 
as annoying for you as Adonis probably was for me.&quot; Makoto nodded at 
that and slowly the pieces began to fall into place. &quot;Does anyone 
else see a pattern here?&quot;
	There were quite murmurs around the table but no one 
commented. It was obvious anyway that Minako had brought a valid 
point and that was probably the closest we had ever come to unveil 
our enemies&#39; identity in all the time since their reawakening.
	&quot;I wish I could remember more about my past,&quot; Rei spoke up 
softly, a thoughtful look on her face. &quot;What you are saying stirs 
something but I can&#39;t really remember.&quot; She glanced at Ami who nodded 
in agreement. &quot;So... Are we to suspect that some of our enemies have 
personal relations with our past lives?&quot;
	&quot;We must assume that. This is our only lead so far,&quot; Minako 
confirmed. Closing her eyes, she leaned against Hotaru a little more 
and I could tell that both girls were really tired from whatever 
happened earlier.
	Trading a glance with Usagi who had watched them for a while 
now as well, I realized that this was probably the furthest we would 
get at the moment. We had made a lot of headway today. Unfortunately 
my charges had once again been denied a normal, happy day that I had 
so much wished them. I wanted to curse someone but had really nobody 
that I could...
	&quot;I think this is enough for today. Why don&#39;t we all go back 
to the Jinja. I believe we still have a birthday to celebrate.&quot;
	Minako looked openly thankful at that and favored me with a 
smile while replying, &quot;Am I supposed to know that?&quot;
	Everyone laughed at the comment.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Usagi)
I yawned profoundly and stretched to try and get at least some of my 
tired muscles to respond again. &quot;I am glad this day is over,&quot; I said 
more to myself since I noticed almost everyone was huddled together 
in individual conversations. Ami and Makoto were outside somewhere, 
Luna and Artemis were talking with Mamoru about something but I was 
too exhausted to get up and be curious, Rei and Hitome were chatting 
in another corner of the room and Minako and Hotaru quietly sat close 
together, obviously simply enjoying each other&#39;s company. It had 
indeed been a long and draining day. Both physically and emotional. 
With a glance at the quiet couple I could only shake my head sadly. 
They had told us that Minako&#39;s parents obviously found out about them 
and kind of overreacted. I doubt that was all there was to it, 
however, none of us asked further questions. This had all been bad 
enough already.
	At least we had been able to pull of a somewhat successful 
party after we finally got back to the Jinja. Hitome hadn&#39;t commented 
at all and at the moment none of us had the nerve to ask her about 
it. We had enough surprises already today. I still couldn&#39;t quite 
believe what Rei told us, even though I suspected already something 
like that was behind it. Once again I was reminded how unfair of a 
life we had to live but at the same time how lucky we were that we 
had each other. Any of us would give everything for the group. And to 
have such loyal and good friends made it all a bit easier to accept.
	Glancing to the side, I noticed Naru coming towards me and 
plopping down. I turned to face her with a teasing smile. &quot;Done 
flirting with Priapos?&quot; I couldn&#39;t suppress the humorous jibe towards 
the, I had to admit, rather familiar interaction between my best 
friend and the elf. It hurt a little at first, to see that someone 
else had taken my place to be there for my friend when I couldn&#39;t, 
but in the end I realized how selfish that thinking was, considering 
the kind of friendship demonstrated by Rei today.
	Naru, to my complete surprise, actually blushed and looked 
down into her lap. &quot;Ano... I wasn&#39;t...&quot; I blinked. That had been more 
a teasing comment than anything serious. I knew that I was only 
seeing things where nothing existed. I mean how likely would it be... 
At least I thought so until right now.
	Then, suddenly, I remembered something that I hadn&#39;t actually 
been giving any thought yet. &quot;Um, Naru-chan... I haven&#39;t seen you and 
Umino together that often in the last days. Is there something... 
wrong?&quot; I asked cautiously, some things beginning to fall into place. 
I had been so busy at school that I hadn&#39;t paid much attention to it 
even though I noticed it. For as long as I could think back, since 
those two started dating, you&#39;d always see them together around 
school.
	Naru fidgeted slightly, then nodded. &quot;Hai. We... I don&#39;t know 
how to explain it. Maybe we really just mistook good friendship for 
love. I am not sure about it anymore but I don&#39;t want to hurt him 
either. That is why I asked Pria-cha... Priapos-san for help. I don&#39;t 
know why I came to her of all people. You were so busy with 
everything and well, I needed someone&#39;s opinion...&quot;
	I leaned forward to hug my best friend, once again feeling 
guilty for my absence in her life. I should have been there, I should 
have helped... But what was done was done. Naru already made clear 
she forgave me and I respected that even if it didn&#39;t help much to 
make me feel better. However, another thing occurred to me and once 
again it was indirectly my fault.
	&quot;Gomen nasai, Naru-chan... I... I think... Maybe it&#39;s because 
I turned back time and let everyone repeat one year after Beryl and 
Metallia were defeated. I just wanted us all to be normal. But you 
two hooked up because of the Dark Kingdom&#39;s actions and...&quot;
	I trailed off as Naru placed her hands on my shoulders and 
held me at arm length. &quot;No, Usagi-chan. That&#39;s not it. I don&#39;t think 
this has anything to do with how we began dating although I was 
always curious about that since I never seemed to be able to 
remember. It doesn&#39;t change the feelings in my heart, you know? Umino 
is a sweet boy and he is so devoted that I don&#39;t think I even deserve 
it. It&#39;s... I am just not sure anymore that this thing between us is 
love.&quot; She trailed off and looked down.
	I reached up to take one of her hands in mine. &quot;Tell you 
what. We make a deal. From now, we are not going around anymore to 
hide things from us. Even if the other is busy at the moment, we both 
proved that we will always have time for each other. You are my best 
friend, Naru-chan. Yes, the others are too but that doesn&#39;t lessen 
your importance. Let us not have any further secrets. I, for my part, 
will trust you with anything.&quot;
	Naru blinked and just started at me for several seconds, then 
slowly began to nod and break out into a genuine smile. I smiled back 
and hugged my friend one last time before settling back.
	&quot;So. You are not mad about me finding out about your secret?&quot; 
Naru inquired but I held up a hand and shot her glance. She blushed, 
realizing the question was silly since we had just made that promise 
and giggled. &quot;I guess you aren&#39;t. Arigato, Usagi-chan. I feared you 
might get mad at me for not telling you. But thinking about it, that 
was stupid thinking. You would never get mad about things like that, 
I should know you better than that.&quot;
	I sighed a little and allowed myself a faint smile. Naru 
looked at me quizzically, clearing not understanding the 
reaction. &quot;We all changed a little over the last years, Naru-chan. 
I... I have responsibilities that caused me to change and will 
continue to change me. I am going to be sixteen soon and if I look 
back on my life I know I have been pretty childish until recently. 
Sometimes I wish I could have that back, but when we were reawakened 
two weeks ago, I realized that was all it would ever be. A wish. I AM 
a princess. And at some point in the future I might be the heir to 
the throne. I&#39;m not sure I want this but I know it has to be done...&quot; 
I broke of my monologue, noticing that Naru was giggling 
uncontrollably which served to utterly confuse me and made Naru laugh 
even more. &quot;What&#39;s so funny,&quot; I asked, now a little irritated.
	&quot;You. I was just trying to picture you as a princess or 
queen. It&#39;s just... Impossible!&quot; As soon as she blurted out the last 
words with a twinkle in her eye she had already jumped up and was 
running.
	Within a heartbeat my exhaustion had evaporated and I was 
chasing my friend out of the Jinja, startling Ami and Makoto on the 
front porch half to death. Despite appearing totally outraged I was 
laughing. I hadn&#39;t felt that good ever since reawakening. Not getting 
together with Mamoru and my friends again had produced that kind of 
happiness. No, it was the simple thing of a lifelong friend reminding 
me that despite all the duties that I had began to accept despite 
their weight, I was still Tsukino Usagi, a normal girl, just like 
Okaasan had wanted it.
	&quot;Come back here!&quot; I screeched after Naru who proved much more 
agile when I expected. &quot;I&#39;ll teach you impossible!&quot;

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Mamoru)
I watched Usagi chase after Naru with a smile tugging on my lips. She 
looked a lot more relaxed like this, much more like the Usagi I 
couldn&#39;t help but flirting with during the first year... Well, we 
both probably would have never admitted to calling it that but in a 
way that was exactly what our banter had been. For the last two weeks 
that Usagi had almost totally disappeared in light of the events. The 
constant pressure had me afraid that she might break under it soon 
and I was very glad for at least those short moments of relaxing and 
normalcy. It wasn&#39;t going to last, I knew, not until the situation 
had relaxed a little more.
	My expression shifting to serious again as I turned back to 
the two cats who had also watched the brief disruption of quiet. &quot;I 
wish they had told me more but the energy that&#39;s keeping the stones 
charged is fading and won&#39;t hold for very long,&quot; I explained, picking 
up the earlier topic of our conversation. &quot;However, what Kunzite and 
the others could tell me matches Minako&#39;s theory. There seems to be 
some sort of personal connection. Kunzite knew Adonis but couldn&#39;t 
fathom how he could have shown up here. He hadn&#39;t even been in the 
initial assault on the Moon, so it&#39;s rather impossible that he has 
been reincarnated because of that...&quot;
	Artemis looked thoughtful at that. &quot;No, you are wrong. Adonis 
HAS been reincarnated. At least while I awakened Minako the first 
time. He was leading the Dark Agency. But the Adonis we met in 
England... His memories seemed more like he was ripped right out of 
the Silver Millennium and placed into this time. But the information 
we gathered from his base back in England don&#39;t indicate how he would 
have gotten past Pluto.&quot; He frowned. &quot;I really don&#39;t like that. If 
they, whoever, they are found a way past the Gate we could have a lot 
more of surprises the kind we faced in the last weeks. What do you 
think, Luna?&quot; Luna didn&#39;t reply right away. Actually she seemed to 
have been lost in thought for quite some time now. &quot;Luna?&quot;
	The black cat looked up startled and tried to cover her 
absentminded state. &quot;Ah, nani... Oh yeah, that is really strange. I 
don&#39;t think anyone could time travel without Pluto knowing and we 
know how serious she takes her duty. Or at least that&#39;s how it always 
appeared. After all not much is known about her.&quot; I caught Artemis 
cringe at that last statement. Both seemed to hide something from the 
other, which I thought a bit weird, but shrugged it off, not really 
planning on probing into private matters now. They would tell us if 
it was important, right?
	&quot;Anyway,&quot; I interjected, trying to change the topic. &quot;I have 
that feeling that we will know soon enough who exactly we are 
fighting. Jadeite believes this might really be a testing phase and I 
think at least with the Aura Knight scenario we have proven that we 
aren&#39;t going to be picked off that easily.&quot;
	I sighed inwardly but didn&#39;t let it show as I shot a glance 
over my shoulder at Minako and Hotaru who set huddled together. The 
party seemed to have lightened their clearly depressed mood but now 
that the excitement was over... I had gotten to like those two, Usako 
and I had found ourselves spending a lot of time with them. I thought 
it a shame that they had to go through all this. A blind fool should 
be able to see the unconditional love between them.
	&quot;They are still just children,&quot; I said quietly. &quot;It&#39;s a 
wonder they didn&#39;t break under the pressure yet.&quot; Luna and Artemis 
shared a look but didn&#39;t respond. It wasn&#39;t really necessary. I knew 
the two cats wished for nothing more than a normal life for their 
charges. Unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t about to happen. Probably not 
ever. There would always be some evil out there and those brave girls 
had just the kind of hearts that wouldn&#39;t allow them to ignore it. It 
was a vicious cycle but one that we couldn&#39;t break out from. That was 
one thing the talk with my former Guardians had taught me. 
Responsibility was a heavy duty but if you fought the inevitable it 
would only become worse. I would stand with them, as untapped as my 
powers might be right now. If there was a chance of lessening the 
burden only a little, the effort would be worth it.
	The conversation turned to hypothetical theories then and it 
soon became apparent that we all were too tired to make any serious 
headway about the situation, especially Luna seemed to be distracted. 
Judging how little sleep I suspected she had in the last days I 
wasn&#39;t very surprised. Therefore I excused myself and went in search 
of my errand girlfriend.
	I found her just outside, standing alone in the yard of the 
Jinja. Neither Ami, Makoto or Naru were anywhere in sight which 
served to confuse me a little since I hadn&#39;t seen any of them come in 
or pass me... Then again the Jinja was big enough that you might pass 
by each other without noticing. As I came to a stop a few feet away I 
was suddenly mesmerized by the sight. It had really become late and 
the Moon had risen already, silhouetting Usagi&#39;s figure against the 
soft moonlight. The effect was stunning to say the least and for a 
long moment I felt myself unable to move, several flashes of Serenity 
flickering through my mind. I could actually swear there was a soft 
glow around Usagi now, but maybe that was just because I began to 
become more and more apt in reading auras.
	Closing the distance between us, I wrapped my arms around her 
and was a little surprised to feel her relax into the embrace instead 
of being a little startled. I was sure she hadn&#39;t noticed me... Then 
again, I shouldn&#39;t be. I tended to sense her when she was nearby as 
well. &quot;Feeling better, Hime-chan?&quot; I inquired.
	Usagi was silent for a moment and I enjoyed the close 
contact. She had really grown up from the fourteen year old crybaby I 
had met first just outside Osa P and with a start I realized exactly 
how beautiful she had become. I couldn&#39;t help but tightening my grip 
around her waist. Usagi turned her head and smiled up at me. &quot;Hai, my 
Prince.&quot; She giggled and I couldn&#39;t help but smirk. We had settled 
into this relationship so naturally it seemed scary but Usagi made it 
look so normal and just right. &quot;I guess I needed that.&quot;
	&quot;You shouldn&#39;t take all of this so much to heart, Usako,&quot; I 
chided gently, looking into her eyes seriously. &quot;You have very 
understanding and supporting friends. And they don&#39;t need you 
fretting over their problems all the time, they need you happy and 
carefree.&quot;
	Usagi nodded but didn&#39;t say anything as she turned her head 
to look up at the Moon. A long silence settled over the yard, not 
really an uncomfortable one but not really comfortable either. 
Finally Usagi sighed and looked down. &quot;I accepted all this because I 
know it won&#39;t do any good to fight against it. Sometimes these last 
two weeks I just get depressed though and ask myself who I really am. 
I know what you say is true but most of the time I feel like I have 
been more Serenity than I have been Tsukino Usagi...&quot;
	I cut her off by turning her around. Holding my girlfriend on 
arm&#39;s length I looked at her intently. &quot;That is not true. You are not 
the one thing or the other. I talked to Minako awhile ago about how 
she felt about the reincarnation thing and if it was bothering her to 
be so... close to her past life. Do you know what she said?&quot; I didn&#39;t 
wait for Usagi to answer, continuing in a soft voice. &quot;She said there 
isn&#39;t any difference. Hebe and her might have led different lives but 
they ARE the same person now. Both are part of the whole. When we 
were reincarnated our past lives became a part of what we are today. 
They ARE us, not just some hidden personality that pops up and every 
now and then and helps us out. Tell me, did you feel that something 
was missing when we lost our memory after Beryl?&quot;
	Usagi had been holding my gaze until this moment. Now she 
blinked, surprise beginning to creep into her face. &quot;Ano... Not 
exactly. It felt more like... something was locked away. I always 
though it was just the memories but...&quot; Her eyes began to shine with 
strange expression of surprise and then actually relief. &quot;You mean, 
with the memories, the part of us that is our past life had been 
locked away and that was why we never felt totally complete.&quot;
	I nodded. &quot;Hai. All our memories, what we experience, all 
that makes us what we are. If we try to deny a part of it, it is like 
denying apart of ourselves.&quot;
	Usagi&#39;s face broke into a wide smile and she leaned forward 
to bury her head in my chest. &quot;Arigato, Mamo-chan. That is exactly 
what I needed to hear.&quot;
	&quot;You are welcome, Usako.&quot; I leaned down and wasn&#39;t surprised 
to meet Usagi halfway for a long kiss.

(Ami)
The evening air was a bit cold and the wind added an extra chill at 
that time of the year. The temperatures had rapidly dropped the last 
weeks and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there was early snow this 
winter. As expected I found Makoto sitting on the porch of the Jinja, 
head in her hands and gazing up into the night&#39;s sky, lost in thought.
	I had noticed her missing after the main celebrations had 
died down and everyone split up into little groups. So much had 
happened today, it was only natural that some things needed to be 
cleared up. And Makoto, being as stubborn as ever, tried to deal with 
hers alone, of course. As much as she had changed, I knew her good 
enough by now to realize my roommate wasn&#39;t one to burden others with 
her personal problems. She tended to rather keep them inside herself 
which only ended in depressing her further.
	As I wordlessly sat down next to her, she glanced at me for a 
moment with a wry smile before turning back to watch the Moon and the 
stars. &quot;This is becoming a habit, you know?&quot; True. First it was Rei, 
then Makoto earlier in the day and now again the brunette. I don&#39;t 
think I had ever pried into other people&#39;s business so much before.
	I had to chuckle at that line of thought. &quot;That&#39;s entirely 
your fault. You are always telling me not to keep everything to 
myself and that I have friends that will help me if I have a problem. 
You realize, of course, that the same goes for you.&quot;
	My brunette friend laughed at that and suddenly let herself 
fall back onto the porch. &quot;Touch&eacute;.&quot; Her gaze drifted over to me
with 
a genuine smile now, before a faraway look crossed her face. &quot;I guess 
I&#39;m just not good at taking my own advice.&quot; A faint chuckle escaped 
my friend&#39;s lips before she continued. &quot;I won&#39;t lie to you, Ami. This 
IS bothering me. More than anything ever bothered me for a long time 
now. There are a lot of unresolved feelings between Atlas and me. He 
made my life on Jupiter a living hell most of the time and I used to 
hate him for that. But at the same time I feel sorry for him, because 
he let himself succumb so easily to power. I just don&#39;t know how to 
face him and face him I will. Soon actually...&quot; Makoto held a hand 
over her heart. &quot;I feel it, in here.&quot;
	I was silent, looking up into the night&#39;s sky as well, as if 
it was holding all the answers to our questions and problems. My 
heart went out to my friend who I had gotten to know so much better 
over the last two weeks and it made me feel helpless, knowing that 
there wasn&#39;t much that I could do about Makoto&#39;s problem. &quot;He was... 
your friend once, yes? That&#39;s why it is so hard despite whatever he 
has become since then.&quot;
	&quot;He was my friend, yes. I know it&#39;s foolish. He treated me 
like a prize for almost all the time we knew each other. And still I 
can&#39;t help but think back at the innocent boy I once knew...&quot; Makoto 
sat back up and we simultaneously turned to look at each other. &quot;I 
guess it does not matter. I will have to face him eventually and I 
will be ready then,&quot; she stated a little firmer. However, I could 
still here the distress over the concept in the other girl&#39;s voice. I 
wasn&#39;t sure, but somehow I had the impression she wasn&#39;t telling me 
anything. I wouldn&#39;t pry any further though, enough old and new 
wounds had been opened today already.
	I reached for her hand and took it in mine, clasping it 
tightly. &quot;WE will face him, Makoto. All of us together. Just like we 
always do.&quot;
	Makoto looked down at her hand in mine and then back up to 
fathom me with a smile which spoke of a much lighter heart. Before I 
could react, she had draped an arm around my shoulders and pulled me 
closer against her taller frame, totally surprising me with the 
action. &quot;Arigato,&quot; was the only thing she said as her other hand 
continued to grasp my own, now with an almost fierce need.
	I didn&#39;t know what to do, not sure what exactly the change in 
contact meant. It felt nice but I wasn&#39;t really sure what to make of 
it. &quot;Mako-chan, I...&quot; Makoto put a finger over my lips and I 
immediately fell silent. I felt myself staring into these emerald 
eyes and once again had this odd sensation, just like last time in 
Makoto&#39;s apartment. I couldn&#39;t quite grasp it but was sure that 
Makoto would have wanted to do something totally different before 
moving her finger from my lips and settling down against me, staying 
silent.
	We sat there for several minutes. Neither speaking or even 
moving. For some reason the closeness felt... right. I still couldn&#39;t 
figure out what it meant. If I was falling for my friend or maybe 
not. For the moment though I really didn&#39;t care that much and quickly 
gave up trying to figure it out. What I knew with absolute certainty 
was that Makoto obviously needed someone to hold onto right now. I 
honestly wished I remembered more of my own past, maybe there was 
something similar in those memories that could help me understand her 
situation better. As it was, this was the only thing I could do. And 
I did it without regret.
	The silence was suddenly disrupted as without warning Naru 
ran past us into the courtyard, followed by a blonde whirlwind called 
Usagi, yelling angry but looking more like she was enjoying a day in 
an amusement park. After getting over the initial shock, I turned my 
head towards Makoto and found her smirking at the scene. &quot;Looks like 
they worked out their problems at least. I am glad,&quot; my friend 
stated, then glanced back at me and actually colored slightly before 
moving her arm away... Was it just now that she realize what she had 
been doing?
	I think I surprised myself when I reached up and caught her 
hand before she could move away. Makoto stared at me perplexed but I 
just smiled at her, trying to look as understanding as possible. I 
felt her muscles tense slightly, then relax as she settled her arm 
back into place.
	Nothing was said as we turned back to watch the chase that 
continued all over the yard and back. When Usagi finally did catch up 
with her friend, they were wrestling a little even though you could 
clearly see that the blonde girl was holding back her strength. 
Finally she had Naru pinned underneath her and they were grinning at 
each other.
	&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell them about it when Rei did, anyway,&quot; 
Makoto asked suddenly.
	I blinked, not understanding right away. After a moment I 
realized she meant the application in Germany. &quot;There wasn&#39;t a need 
to. My and Rei&#39;s situation were similar in a way, at least the 
reaction would have been the same. I know what the others would say 
and the same that Rei said to Usagi goes for me as well.&quot; I followed 
the two girls now getting up and going over to the stairs to sit down 
there. &quot;Why bother them with even more that can&#39;t be changed anyway. 
I have made my decision already, just like Rei.&quot;
	Makoto nodded, not surprised at my answer as it seemed. I had 
the impression anyway that she had known I would say this anyway. 
There really was no need to burden Usagi further. She was already 
taking so much responsibility. I knew without her telling me that my 
problems would always be appreciated and that made feel very special. 
They were like the big family I never had but always wished for and 
that is why not accepting the invitation wasn&#39;t really a problem for 
me. In the end I would end up losing more than I gained and that just 
wasn&#39;t worth it.
	The two of us sat there for awhile. Watching Priapos come by, 
from wherever she had vanished to earlier, and offering to take Naru 
home. That made us aware of how late it actually had become. We still 
had a school day tomorrow, after all. And so, after saying some quick 
goodbyes, we went home as well.

(Hotaru)
It was close to midnight outside when the group finally parted and 
almost everyone went home. Priapos, Naru, Ami, Makoto, Usagi and 
Mamoru, plus Luna, had went home already and Rei was just now seeing 
Hitome off. While she did work here, she had her own home after all. 
Minako had stayed outside under some lame excuse to get some fresh 
air after we saw Priapos off. I had considered staying with her but 
while I wanted to be nowhere else right now than close to my mate, I 
knew deep down that she might need some time to really sort things 
out in her head. Minako might be tough and certainly stood to the 
decision she made today, but it had to affect her in some way after 
all.
	I really wished I could help somehow. Artemis had told us 
about what happened after the screaming war in Aino-ke and that gave 
us a sliver of hope that things would work out in the end. I was 
surprised to hear what Minako&#39;s father had done for me and felt 
rather relieved by the concept that I might have that problem taken 
care of at last. Still, a lot of hurt had been generated today and it 
would be awhile until those wounds would be closed and trust could be 
rebuild. At least Minako&#39;s parents seemed to have realized that.
	Now, the question remained where to stay. Somehow the 
question had been forgotten over the course of the evening and now 
everyone was gone. We could always go over to Priapos&#39; apartment. 
Even though it provided not much space, for tonight it surely would 
be enough. In one thing we silently agreed on though. Neither of us 
wanted to go home right now. There would just be too much awkwardness 
and the constant reminder of what happened. The party had taken our 
minds off the events earlier in the day and neither of us was to keen 
of being reminded directly.
	&quot;You want to stay here?&quot; I glanced up and saw Rei, who had 
come back in without me noticing, sitting down opposite of me. &quot;We 
have enough space here and I doubt you want to go back right now.&quot;
	The surprise clearly must have shown on my face. Minako had 
joked about it this morning but that had been more amusement on her 
part. Sure, we probably both thought about it later but hadn&#39;t asked, 
not quite sure if the miko would be willing. Sure, she was a lot more 
relaxed and her confession seemed to have drained much of her sharp 
temper of the last days, however, staying here might have been asking 
a bit too much. &quot;If it is no problem,&quot; I replied carefully. Her tone 
didn&#39;t seem to supply any reluctance but one could never know.
	Rei shook her head and smiled faintly. &quot;It is the least I can 
do after you saved my life back there.&quot; Her face became stern. &quot;That 
was pretty reckless though. I hope you didn&#39;t just do that to impress 
me.&quot;
	I could see that she was only half serious with the last 
statement. Still, I wasn&#39;t too sure about that incident myself. Why 
the heck had I done something so foolish. I could have... I SHOULD 
have gotten killed. Yes, there was that... other part of me that 
seemed to protect me from harm but I had no idea what it was and how 
to control it. I&#39;m not sure I even thought about that at the moment.
	We had arrived at the battle scene and had spotted Mars in 
trouble. Quite frankly, I&#39;m not even sure if I had moved on my own 
account, something inside of me just seemed to urge me on, to save 
her. As ridiculous as that sounded to me. I choose my answer 
carefully, knowing that the miko was already wary of my other side, 
there was no further need to strain the peace that was achieved 
today. &quot;I am not sure myself why I did that. I know where is 
something else, inside of me, it seems to protect me from harm. I was 
aware of what I was doing, at least for awhile but it wasn&#39;t really 
me doing it... If that makes any sense.&quot;
	Rei rubbed her chin thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;I don&#39;t 
believe it, whatever it is, is evil.&quot; At my surprised look her 
thoughtful expression turned into a smile. &quot;It saved me after all. 
I... couldn&#39;t really identify the power but I was right next to it 
and I couldn&#39;t feel any evil intentions. And now it seems, I owe you 
my life.&quot; Almost like an afterthought she said, &quot;Besides, Minako 
trusts you and I have the feeling she knows already. And while I 
might have said some dumb things lately, I know that she has always 
been serious when it came to us Senshi and what might be a danger.&quot;
	That was something I could only agree on. As Venus, my mate 
was always more confident and concentrated purely on the situation at 
hand almost all the time. This side of her was fascinating and had 
always intrigued me and from watching her work I knew Rei was right 
about it. &quot;It scares me sometimes, Hino-san,&quot; I said softly, not very 
comfortable talking about the subject. While I knew deep down that 
this other side of me didn&#39;t want any harm, I had my fair share of 
experience by the demon - or so Minako and Artemis claimed - that had 
used me as a host for several years of my life, thus destroying my 
childhood and my family in the process.
	&quot;Onegai, call me Rei. You are part of the family after all.&quot; 
My face lit up immediately at the words and I was pleasantly 
surprised at the honesty of the statement. Somehow I had the feeling 
Rei had meant a lot more with it when I was able to grasp but that 
wasn&#39;t really all that important right now. Rei chuckled at my 
expression. &quot;You have been the moment Minako introduced you, even if 
I might have been less... accepting. I wanted to apologize for my 
behavior anyway, I had no right to judge you from personal 
experience. Maybe my problem was not that I didn&#39;t see how much you 
two belonged together but that you actually seemed to be inseparable 
by whatever was thrown at you...&quot; She trailed off, then began to 
speak again but closed her mouth with something akin to a nostalgic 
look on her face.
	&quot;Maybe you were right,&quot; I picked up the conversation again 
before an awkward gap could appear. &quot;Maybe we really don&#39;t know what 
society can do to us. Today ought to have shown this and it is just 
now beginning to sink in.&quot; I paused for a moment, daring to look the 
miko straight into the eyes. &quot;However, what matters in the end is 
that we are together. It might sound fatalistic but I really can&#39;t 
imagine a life without Minako anymore. It is scary sometimes, yes, 
yet I do not regret anything as long as we can be together.&quot;
	Rei held my gaze for several moments and then sighed 
wistfully. &quot;I guess you are lucky then.&quot; Under her breath she 
added, &quot;Luckier than me.&quot; I didn&#39;t comment on it, seeing no need to 
aggravate her. Maybe I was wrong after all. I thought I had figured 
out what exactly had bothered her about us but judging by the 
reactions I had the strong feeling now that there was more than just 
a relationship gone wrong. Whatever the case, it was not my place to 
pry. Also, looking up at the clock and feeling for the item in my 
pocket, I still had something to do. 
	&quot;I am going to fetch Aino-chan then,&quot; I said, getting up. &quot;We 
have a school day tomorrow after all.&quot;
	We ended up calling in sick but that was beside the point.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

(Minako)
I had always had a strong affirmation with the Moon. Maybe, it was 
because Serenity and Hebe were so close or the Moon and Venus were so 
similar in their mystical nature. Whatever it was, the soft, pale 
light of the night had always managed to calm me and wash away the 
perils of the day. Until I became Venus I never really know why that 
was but I trusted it nonetheless, not questioning the connection.
	And so I found myself under the moonlight once again, sitting 
on the edge of the Jinja&#39;s roof, my feet dangling over the edge as I 
gazed out over the city sleeping peacefully, more or less ignorant of 
the true horrors that its nexus-like properties spawned day for day. 
There was no questioning that Tokyo indeed had to be a magical nexus 
in a way, judging by the fact that all of us had been born... or at 
least been drawn here. Here our destiny unveiled and the struggle 
with the Dark Kingdom that had begun ages ago finally came to an end. 
Or so we thought. Now, I wasn&#39;t too sure anymore.
	The puzzle had begun to make more sense now with Jupiter&#39;s 
recollection. Was that really a personal thing? Or better, was it 
just a personal thing? They, whoever they were, were using Youma, 
too. Youma, Metallia&#39;s spawn, twisted beings of evil that once had 
been human. But most of them were old and couldn&#39;t be healed anymore, 
like the Seven Shadows or the Youma turned in this time.
	What troubled me even more were the emotions evoked by 
Jupiter&#39;s tale of Atlas. Adonis... The tale was different, the 
outcome similar. He had become as obsessive with me as Atlas had with 
Jupiter. Unfortunately I never had the possibility to fully get away 
from him since he had been under Kunzite&#39;s command. I felt a certain 
uneasiness thinking about him now that I didn&#39;t understand. He was 
dead, there was no way he could have survived the final battle in 
England. No power known to me, not even Metallia, could have saved 
him from his fate. But still...
	I sighed deeply. This was getting me nowhere. I knew I was 
just distracting myself from the real problem, thinking about Senshi 
matters. All that did was creating new worries that I really didn&#39;t 
need right now. On the other hand I wasn&#39;t too eager to think about 
the more personal problem either. True, it was easy to say that it 
didn&#39;t effect me but stating that turning away from my family really 
did not matter would be... was a lie. I knew it, Hotaru knew it. What 
happened today HAD hurt. At that moment though the pain had been dull 
and pretty much insignificant to Hotaru&#39;s. Now, with some distance 
and secure in the knowledge that we had weathered this storm, the 
realization of what exactly happened began to kick in. And I really 
didn&#39;t want to think about this right now.
	Spotting a figure step out into the yard, a smile came to my 
face as I felt my heart soar at the sight of Hotaru looking around in 
mild confusion. I knew it wouldn&#39;t be too long until she sensed me up 
here and so I stood up carefully and jumped down behind her. There 
was practically no sound at all as my feet touched the ground below 
with cat-like grace. Wrapping my arms around the smaller girl who 
squeaked a little in surprise which just showed that we both had a 
lot on our minds, normally she would have known somehow I was behind 
her.
	The surprise quickly changed to contentment as Hotaru let out 
a sigh of happiness and fell back into the embrace. &quot;You weren&#39;t 
planning on running out on me now, were you?&quot; she asked with a mix of 
half-joking, half-serious tone. I once again marveled at how 
naturally we fit together this way. Probably most of it was 
imagination but sometimes it seemed as if we were meant to be one. 
Geez, could I sound anymore cheesy?
	I chuckled. &quot;I don&#39;t think my feet would have cooperated with 
the idea.&quot; I let go of her and turned to head back and sat on the 
porch. Hotaru followed and sat down next to me. I put an arm around 
her and she rested her head on my shoulder and no words were spoken 
for several minutes. A few crickets were chirping and a lone owl 
added to the otherwise silent night&#39;s atmosphere. I felt my worries 
retreating for the moment and was more than happy about it. All this 
could be taken care of later, not now. Now all I really needed was 
already here with me.
	I felt Hotaru shift next to me, lifting her head from my 
shoulder, and looked to the side. Blue met purple and I became 
transfixed for a moment, losing myself in the intense gaze. The 
sensation of Hotaru&#39;s hand touching mine made me look down. She was 
interlacing her fingers with mine and I clasped them lightly. I could 
feel her shiver but it didn&#39;t seem to be from the chilly autumn air.
	&quot;Rei said that we can stay tonight,&quot; Hotaru finally said. I 
was aware of her fidgeting now and frowned, trying to gauge her 
feelings over our link. However, I couldn&#39;t get anything from that 
end as she was obviously tightly blocking it. Just as I was about to 
ask, my mate began to relax and used her free hand to cup my cheek. I 
leaned into the touch on instinct, raveling in the smoothness of the 
pale skin against my own.
	&quot;What you... said to me, that you would put me before your 
duty...&quot;
	I sighed, interrupting her before she could say anything 
more. &quot;I meant it. Well, let&#39;s say I&#39;d put you on the same level at 
least. Usagi is as much like a sister to me as Serenity was to Hebe. 
We&#39;ve been close in both lives. For me it is not really a duty 
anymore as it is natural, just as it is with you. Maybe it always has 
been. That is what Adonis never really understood. I guess I didn&#39;t 
understand it myself until recently, until I met you.&quot;
	Hotaru blinked, her hand falling down, obviously she hadn&#39;t 
expected that sort of reply. A moment later she broke out into a wide 
smile that instantly reminded me of one of those things I swore to 
always protect. &quot;Even so, that was the sweetest thing someone ever 
said to me. I know what it meant to you, saying this, I didn&#39;t need 
to see it this detailed to know. That&#39;s why...&quot; She trailed off and I 
looked on curiously as she fumbled for something and finally coming 
up with a red velvet box. Hotaru proceeded to place it into my hand.
	I drew in a sharp breath, not quite sure what was coming next 
but I had a sneaking suspicion. Carefully I opened the lid of the box 
and gasped at what I saw. I had expected a ring or something, that 
would have made sense and somehow I had almost suspected something 
like this of my mate. But there wasn&#39;t a ring.
	Inside lay a simple looking golden band with tiny little 
crescent moons on its surface. What was most fascinating was the fact 
that it was tied together by what appeared to be a crystalline shape 
resembling the symbol of Venus. I couldn&#39;t quite identify what kind 
of crystal it was but it sparkled as the pale moonlight hit it, 
creating a rippling effect and highlighting another symbol that 
rested inside the heart shape. The sign of Libra.
	&quot;Raven, this is...&quot; I searched for words but couldn&#39;t find 
anything to properly describe what I was feeling, too strong and 
diverse were the sensations. The object despite the crystalline 
symbol that was obviously made with a lot of care wasn&#39;t looking 
really expensive, however, it emanated an aura of calm and a sense of 
warmth flooded through me that I could only vaguely decipher as what 
a child might feel like in its mother&#39;s arms. Also despite not 
looking very expense, it was definitely beautiful.
	&quot;Okaasan gave that to me. She said to keep it and that I 
would one day fall in love with someone born under the sign of Libra 
who would take care of me. I don&#39;t think I believed her back then, 
after all I was just a child and all that seemed so far away,&quot; Hotaru 
explained and I began to understand the feeling of warmth better and 
was amazed at the same time of the accuracy of Hotaru&#39;s mother&#39;s 
predicament. The way Hotaru spoke of her, as rare as those occasions 
were, made me wish I could have met the woman.
	Hotaru reached over to take out the band and then slid down 
from the porch, to kneel on the cool ground. Taking my hand she 
looked up at me with a silent question in her eyes. I could only nod, 
my heart nearly exploding with happiness. What else could I have 
done? I was so overwhelmed a coherent thought was hard to form. Not 
to mention that I had no intention of declining what would come next. 
It was only with her next words that I realized exactly what she was 
up to.
	&quot;A token of our love this is,&quot; she said, her voice quivering 
slightly before becoming firmer. Her eyes were conveying a silent 
begging but there was no real need to. With all that happened today, 
this ending came natural and the words sprang from my lips without 
hesitation.
	&quot;Together we traveled the stars,&quot; my voice was shaking as 
well, as a sudden float of memories assaulted me. Somewhere else, in 
a different time, under the light of the Earth hanging in the sky, it 
had been the same situation with the only person whose love was the 
only one coming close to this one. And it had only been a short time 
before his betrayal and the fall of the Moon Kingdom...
	&quot;My perils are yours as yours are mine.&quot;
	&quot;Now I take this token, so that our fates shall be entwined.&quot;
	Hotaru slipped the band around my wrist with trembling 
fingers and I grasped her hand tightly, pulling her up to a standing 
position. I think I was... No, I was sure that I was crying openly. 
This wasn&#39;t even a really formal proposal but it meant something for 
the part of me that was Hebe, not to mention that it meant something 
for me as well. A part of me was scared, that this was maybe a sign 
that I could lose Hotaru as I had Kunzite, however, this sensation 
quickly faded as I pushed onward, fulfilling the ancient poem. 
	&quot;Selene, bless this union of our hearts, make it know forever 
in the stars,&quot; we finished the old oath. I did not question it this 
moment. After all there were enough people around here who still 
remembered some of the old customs of the Silver Millennium and who 
could have told Hotaru. One of those customs was that a loving heart 
may offer his or her partner a token of love at midnight eve of their 
coming-of-age, which in the Silver Millennium was the sixteenth 
birthday. The custom was said to bless the union, granting the lovers 
a long and happy life.
	I slid down to the ground standing in front of Hotaru, the 
Moon above seemed to bask us in a single ray of light, as if sensing 
what was happening. My worries of the day were long forgotten and 
once again where was only us. Grasping Hotaru&#39;s hands tightly I 
searched for her eyes, seeing the tears mirroring my own there. For a 
long moment none of us moved, then Hotaru slowly closed the thin 
distance between us and my arms closed around her without a second 
thought.
	&quot;I will never leave you, Aino-chan,&quot; she whispered and I 
believed her. Our lips met in a sensual kiss, full of feeling and 
care as well as passion at the same time. I felt myself melting into 
the touch and for a moment, just for a moment, there was the 
sensation of two spirits, long dead but now living within us, 
reaching out to brush against each other tentatively.
	Hotaru finally pulled away to nestle her head under my chin. 
Her words were barely a whisper, even in the silence of the 
night. &quot;Happy Birthday, Anata.&quot;
	And that it was indeed. Despite all that happened. Despite 
the fight with my parents, despite the disruption through the golem 
attack. Something had been different that was more important than 
anything else. I had friends as close as a family to celebrate with 
and I had Hotaru who, against all that was thrown our way, was still 
here, with me, and our love was even stronger now than before. That 
is what mattered and nothing else. That is what made this birthday 
one that I would ever remember. The negative, I knew, could and 
probably would be resolved later, the positive would forever stay 
with me and hopefully never change.

-----Bishoujo-----Senshi-----Sailor---Moon-----R-----

Moon has signed in.
Moon: *looking around* Ano? Hotaru-chan? Hello? You there? *spots 
Venus and Saturn making out in a corner* WHAT ARE YOU DOING? YOU ARE 
SUPPOSED TO GIVE US A MORAL!!!
Saturn: *jumping in surprise* Ah... Err... *looks sheepish and a 
little scared at the fuming Moon*
Venus: ...
Maia: *appearing out of nowhere* Oh, forget it, Odango Atama! No one 
is EVER going to do your moral!
Usagi: *spluttering* And how would YOU know?
Maia: *arms crossed* Because I am inspiring the whole thing.
Venus: *scratches her head* Huh? How can you inspire memories?
MysticMew: *grabbing a startled Maia* You, come back here! What the 
hell are you doing IN the story?
Maia: *struggles free* That&#39;s not the story, it&#39;s that stupid moral 
idea of yours.
MysticMew: My idea? You wouldn&#39;t leave me alone before I did it!
Maia: *crosses her arms again* Oh yeah, everyone can say that. You 
should rather be doing a better job of finishing your parts sooner 
with all the inspiration I waste on this...
MysticMew: *interrupting angrily* And you should keep a steadier flow 
on that inspiration! Not months of Writer&#39;s Block and then you are 
making everything longer than I plan for!
Maia: Writer&#39;s Block? Hah! A petty excuse for... *trails off and 
slowly turns to see Saturn looming over here with her glaive poised 
for a strike* Um...
Saturn: *in a chilling voice* So you were responsible that those 
recordings took so long? Aino-chan and I had things planned today, 
you know?
Maia: *sweatdrops* Well, I... *looks for MysticMew to blame but he 
has, wisely, disappeared* You see... that is... *dodges a swing* Hey, 
save it you... you... glaive-wielding maniac!
Saturn: *now twirling her glaive around* Maniac? I show you a maniac, 
you crazy pixie!
Maia: *glowering with rage* Pixie? PIXIE?!? Take that back! FIREBALL!
Saturn: *blocking the spell* You have to do better than that! DEATH 
REBORN REVOLUTION!
Maia: DRAGON SLAVE!
Moon: *turning to Venus* Aren&#39;t you going to help her?
Venus: *watching as the two blast each other into tiny bits* There&#39;s 
a time to stand up for the one you love... and there is a time where 
you wisely leave them alone.
Moon: *thoughtful* Hmm... I suppose that will have to do, even though 
it has not much to do with this...
The screen wavers slightly and then turns into static before going 
blank completely.
MysticMew: *popping up* Gomen, it appears this has gotten a little 
out of control. I am forced to end this now before any more damage 
can be done.
Screen turns black again.

Author&#39;s Note

Phew, this has surely been a long one. The longest episode yet. First 
off, I have to apologize for the lack of ANY updates lately 
(especially off-list in the archives). There had been several reasons 
for that, none of which has much to do with time (maybe only, that I 
have to MUCH right now). First off, I had been busy with several 
games and actually typing the entire story script of Skies of Arcadia 
Legends) over the summer months, then the heat here was doing nothing 
good for my concentration and lastly Maia decided to be stubborn and 
infuse me with a bad case of Writer&#39;s Block...
Now she&#39;s back full force though and I have no idea what to do 
first. :) I tell you, the terror is going to be the death of me one 
day.

Anyway, on to the notes, since this episode has already been so long, 
I don&#39;t want to bore you to death with page-long notes now.
There actually really is not much to say. I explained things so 
thoroughly within the story I doubt there are too many questions left 
open.
There is the issue of Minako&#39;s parents for once. I didn&#39;t want them 
to be exactly like Crawlspace&#39;s version and I don&#39;t intend the 
current wedge a permanent one. What I needed here was simply an 
extreme reaction and I believe I managed that. Sometimes it needs a 
drastic action to bring people out of their own little world. Anyway, 
I don&#39;t plan on including anyone&#39;s family that much since it was 
never a big issue in canon anime and manga either, but there will be 
the one or other occurrences.
Mamoru&#39;s stones are again taken from the manga, as so much about him. 
Anime simply screwed up his character and it is not really surprising 
that so many people don&#39;t like him. The stones are what is left of 
the guardians and they sometimes help them to appear in spirit to aid 
their Prince.
The song I used in the middle part is &quot;Nothing&#39;s Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; 
from Jefferson Starship. I originally had another song planned but 
then I came across this one and it just perfectly fit for what I 
wanted. I never actually wanted them to sing it, that was simply a 
spur of the moment thing, but my beta assured me it worked off very 
well.
I hope you liked the little excursion into elf bonding. This came 
about as a mixed influence by several works, mostly those of Greywolf 
(Guardians of the Star) and a bit of Biles and TheJudge&#39;s 
(Millennials) stuff, as well as my own opinion on the matter.
Some of you might have realized already who Mako&#39;s sensei is (not 
that hard to tell) and therefore probably figured out where the idea 
for the improvised attack came from. It was just simply perfect for 
that occasion.
Otherwise that is pretty much it. Most of the secrets with Rei will 
be cleared up in the next chapter probably. The next chapters will be 
centered on Mars, Mercury and Jupiter. In this order. Manga readers 
might realize this but I am not going to tell how much will be 
similar as well.

Feedback as always is appreciate, wanted and needed. I want to take 
the time to thank everyone who has been sending feedback and was 
patient enough to wait the now nearly five months since the third 
episode...

Ja ne, yours

Matthias
