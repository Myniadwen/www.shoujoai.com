<p>:::: Livin La Vida Loca ::::</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't belive it!&quot; Minako gushed. &quot;You decided to come with us Setsuna!&quot;  The guardian of Time coughed a bit and blushed. &quot;Haruka nearly dragged  me...&quot; Setsuna mumbled under her breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Why, oh <em>why</em> are we going to a <em>karaoke</em> bar?&quot; Rei whined, trying to show everyone her distaste for the said  bar, but everyone could see an excited gleam in the shrine maiden's  eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh hush up. You're just sad because your <em>Usa-ko</em> is  not gonna be here for a while.&quot; Makoto teased. She ducked and laughed  as Rei's shoe went flying over her head. Ami fired a glare at the fire  goddess as she brushed a hand through her love's brown hair. Minako  laughed and rested her head on her Setsuna's shoulder. The woman  tensed, before she relaxed and gave a happy little sigh.</p>
<p><em>&quot; I see you windin and grindin, up on the floor,&quot;</em> Minako began to sing impishly, her voice very soft so that only Setsuna could hear. The Senshi of Time groaned in annoyance.</p>
<p><em>&quot;I know you see me lookin' at you when you already know,&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;Minako...&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;I wanna love you (love you) But you already know--&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;You'll  be sleeping on the couch, if you keep that up.&quot; Finished Setsuna.  Minako blinked and pulled her fingers over her lips like a zipper.</p>
<p>--- An hour later ---</p>
<p>&quot;Where  the hell is she!?&quot; Rei roared. Due to the loud music pounding  throughout the bar, the girls had to shout in order to be heard. Makoto  rolled her eyes. There was absolutly no doubt as to who Rei spoke of.</p>
<p>&quot;A little clingly today aren't we?&quot; the brunette shouted.</p>
<p>&quot;Shut-up!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-chan!&quot;  Rei and Makoto turned to see Usagi pushing and shoving her way through  the crowd. Almost immediatly, the tension in the miko's shoulders  vanished at the sight of the moon hime. Makoto rolled her eyes again.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry!&quot; Usagi wailed. &quot;But, there was a traffic jam and the cab broke down and--&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's okay!&quot; Rei laughed. Minako suddenly grabbed Rei's arm and began to drag her to the stage. &quot;Ah! What the--!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ne, Rei-chan, let's give'em a show?&quot; Minako grinned. Rei blinked and smiled devilishly. One night of karaoke wouldn't hurt...</p>
<p>&quot;Attention  please!&quot; Came the announcer's voice. &quot;Singing a duet, allow me to  introduce, Rei Hino and Minako Aino!&quot; The Senshi in the audience  practically fell over at the mention that Rei, of all people, would  sing.</p>
<p>The lights dimmed, and trumpets flared, the speakers  pounding out an ear splitting latino beat. A red spotlight came onto  the stage and Rei began, a sexy purr in her voice that made everyone  swoon.</p>
<p><em>&quot;She's into superstitons; black cats and vodoo dolls.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Minako was next, her voice as smooth as velvet.</p>
<p><em>&quot;I feel, a premonition; That girl's gonna make me fall.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot; She's into new sensations, little kicks in the candlelight.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;She's got, a new addiction, for every day and night!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Minako  continued for the next verse as Rei, to the shock of all, began to  slowly unzip her red jacket, drawing several howls and catcalls from  the men.. <em>&quot;She'll make you take you're clothes </em>off<em>,&quot;</em> At this, Rei stripped away the red jacket completely and tossed it into the crowd. <em>&quot;And go dancing in the rain.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Rei took up the mike again, her uper torso bare save a red tubetop. <em>&quot;She'll make you live her crazy life, or she'll take away your pain.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Then, the two girls sang together, in perfect harmony.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Like a bullet to your brain! Upside inside out!&quot;</em></p>
<p>Minako began to turn in a slow circle, moving her hips as Rei continued with, <em>&quot;She's Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em> Minako rejoined her partner. <em>&quot;She'll</em> <em>push,&quot;</em> the blonde pushed the miko, keeping a hand on the other girl's shoulder.<em> &quot;And pull you down,&quot;</em> Rei rejoined the song again as Minako pulled her back. &quot;<em>Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Lips are devil red,&quot;</em> Rei began.</p>
<p><em>&quot;And her skin's the color of mocha.&quot;</em> Minako finished with a wink at a certain mocha colored woman.<em> &quot;She will wear you out.&quot;</em> the blonde continued with a sexy sigh, draping her arms over the miko's as she smiled at the crowd.<em> &quot;Livin' La Vida Loca.</em></p>
<p><em>Livin' La Vida Loca...</em></p>
<p><em>She's Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p>As the song continued in the instrumental, Minako walked to the edge of the stage and crouched until she was level with one man.<em> &quot;I woke up, in</em> <em>New York City, in a funky, cheap motel.&quot;</em> Standing back up, the miko placed a hand over her heart. <em>&quot;She took my heart and she took my money,</em> <em>she must've slipped me a sleeping pill.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;She never drinks the water makes you order French champange</em>.&quot; Rei sang as she moved her hips oh so slowly.</p>
<p><em>&quot;And once you've had a taste of her, you'll never be the same!&quot;</em> Minako continued.</p>
<p>&quot;<em>Yes she'll make you go insane!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Upside inside out!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot; She's Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em> Minako grinned as Rei threw her hands over her head and did something absolutly <em>sinful</em> with that Senshi flexibility.</p>
<p><em>&quot;She'll push,&quot;</em> This time it was Rei who pushed Minako, keeping a hand on the collar of the blonde's shirt. <em>&quot;And pull you down!&quot;</em> Rei dragged Minako close and they both sang with smirks on their faces,<em> &quot;Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Lips are devil red,&quot;</em> Minako began.</p>
<p><em>&quot;And her skin's the color of mocha.&quot;</em> Rei finished.</p>
<p><em>&quot;She will,&quot;</em> Minako wrapped her arms around Rei's waist and purred, <em>&quot;wear you out! Livin' La Vida Loca! Livin La Vida Loca! She's Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p>---- Usagi ----</p>
<p>When  the announcer had first said that Rei was going to sing, Usagi nearly  screamed with joy. Finally, Rei was going to get over her dislike for  karaoke and have fun! But as soon as her miko and Setsuna's little idol  began their duet, Usagi had discovered something that rocked her to the  bone.</p>
<p>Rei was outright seducing her.</p>
<p>In public.</p>
<p>With <em>song</em>.</p>
<p>In front of the other <em>Senshi</em> for Pete's sake!</p>
<p>It  was completely unexpected, and, in a strange way, absolutly adorable.  Of course, during the course of the song Rei had stripped to the  tubetop that Usagi had bought for her as an April Fool's Day joke (and  Rei had exclaimed, &quot;There is no way in <em>hell</em> I'm wearing this!&quot;), done something <em>unspeakable</em> with her hips, and was now in the arms of one Minako Aino.</p>
<p>If it weren't for the teasing grin on Rei's face (not to mention the fact that Rei was, well, <em>Rei</em>)  Usagi would have believed that Rei and Minako were having a secret  affair. A panting sound caught her attention to the man next to her.</p>
<p>Rage bubbled up as she saw him panting over <em>her</em> Rei-chan. She ground her teeth and slammed the heel of her highheeled  shoe directly on the man's foot. He cried out in agony and Usagi walked  to the front of the stage. She wondered how well Setsuna was taking  this.</p>
<p>--- Setsuna ---</p>
<p>That little <em>vixen.</em></p>
<p>Setsuna  was secrectly proud that her blonde lover was seducing her in public;  it meant that she was unafraid of the social and verbal vegitables that  might have been thrown at her. Yet most of her was, well, shocked that  Minako managed to drag someone else into her little ploy. And not just  anyone. Rei. Cold, distant, spiritual loner, Rei. Setsuna allowed a  grin to crack her normally stoic features.</p>
<p>Good ol' Minako.</p>
<p>Leave it to her to make Setsuna crack a smile.</p>
<p>----- Back on Stage -----</p>
<p>&quot;Do you think it's working!?&quot; Minako hissed.</p>
<p>&quot;Does  it look like I know!?&quot; the dancing (and somewhat blushing) miko snapped  back. Minako rolled her eyes. &quot;Get ready!&quot; she yelled to Rei. &quot;Here's  you're part!&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;She'll make you take your clothes off,&quot;</em> Minako drew the goldenrod t-shirt off to reveal a sunny yellow tank and tossed the shirt into the whooping crowd.<em> &quot;And go dancing in the rain!&quot;</em> Rei finished.</p>
<p><em>&quot;She'll make you live her crazy life, or she;ll take away you're pain!&quot;</em> Minako sang.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Like a bullet to your brain!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;C'mon!&quot;</em> Minako urged the crowd to sing along.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Upside inside out!&quot;</em> The blonde held the mike over the crowd and grinned when they screamed,<em> &quot;Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;That's right!&quot;</p>
<p><em>&quot;She'll push,&quot;</em> This time, both girls pushed off each other,<em> &quot;And pull you down!&quot;</em> They dropped to the ground, still on their feet, only to slide back up with a graceful turn of their hips.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em> The crowd finished.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Lips are devil red!&quot;</em> Rei began.</p>
<p><em>&quot;And her skin's the color of mocha!&quot;</em> Minako finished.</p>
<p><em>&quot;She will wear you out! Livin' La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;What'cha say?!&quot; Minako yelled.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Livin La Vida Loca!&quot;</em></p>
<p>&quot;I can't hear you!&quot; Rei laughed.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Livin' La Vida Loca</em>!&quot;  The trumpets continued, before ending with a loud blare. The applause  shook the foundation, ear-splitting and crazy. Rei and Minako bowed,  then Rei held up her hands. When the crowd was quiet enough, she said,  &quot;Does anyone have my jacket? I kinda need it now.&quot;</p>
