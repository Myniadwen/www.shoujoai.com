Usagi was in her room getting ready for Darien. He wasn&#39;t the same 
person  lately, or, was she the one that was changing? She remembered 
the moments  when she used to idealize him, caught up in his handsome 
looks and pushed  by the feeling that she had to like him. From far 
away it seemed easy.  

But the first time they just kissed it wasn&#39;t as she thought it would 
be.  She pictured the memory in her mind. They were in the park, in 
front of a  beautiful fountain, the moon was full and shiny, and they 
got closer,  leaning over for a kiss...it was the perfect time, the 
perfect place.  

But in the second her lips touched him, his tongue invaded her mouth,  
so surprisingly that she forgot to breath and could only feel his hot  
breath and sour taste, pushing her own, moving with a harsh need. Not 
that  she didn&#39;t know what a French kiss was...but he didn&#39;t give her 
time...it  didn&#39;t feel good, less romantic. She knew he was eager to 
be with her in a  more intimate way, but she wasn&#39;t ready for a rough 
first kiss. 

He  apologized, but she was disappointed, even though he was a nice 
guy. The spark died fast and she was confused about everything. Now he 
was more demanding of being together by themselves, and she didn&#39;t  
know what to do to avoid her feelings of rejections when he would 
touch her.  

The phone rang  

&quot;Usagi?&quot; 

&quot;yes, ...Rei?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, it&#39;s me. Sorry to bother you, I know you have a date with 
Darien, but  I need to talk to you about something important, is about 
the fire readings  if you know what I mean, and I don&#39;t want it to 
linger over the weekend, can  you pass by the shrine before meeting 
him?&quot; 

&quot;No problem, I needed to make time anyways, so I&#39;ll be there in 20 
minutes&quot;  she hated to lie, but it was the perfect excuse. 

&quot;Ok, thanks, and sorry again&quot; 

She kept the phone on her hand, and dialed Darien&#39;s number without a  
reasonable excuse, and when he picked up the phone her mind went 
blank. 

&quot;Do you want to cancel the date? I was almost leaving to pick you 
up...are  you sick?&quot; Darien was puzzled. 

&quot;well...I&#39;m not feeling perfect, but is not that...I just need...to be 
by  myself tonight, I&#39;m sorry I waited till the last minute to tell 
you&quot; 

&quot;Is anything wrong? Is there something you wanna tell me? Did I do 
something  wrong? You&#39;ve been distant lately, I thought it was just a 
face, but I guess  is more serious, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t wanna talk about it right now, please forgive me, can I call 
you  tomorrow?&quot; 

&quot;yes...of course...but I wish you would tell me what&#39;s going on...&quot; 

&quot;I will, don&#39;t worry&quot; 

&quot;ok...love you...&quot; 

&quot;...love you too&quot; -though she was lying again.  </pre>
