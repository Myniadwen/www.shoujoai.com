<p>Clarify as Needed</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section A: Mako and Ami</strong></p>
<p>“W-what?” There was a  faint ringing in Makoto's ears, but she could have sworn she heard  something underneath the surface of Ami's declaration.</p>
<p>Blushing and stammering, Ami blurted  out, “The cooks are horrible without your help! I can't help  it... Even after so many years to get used to their cooking... yours  always tasted the best...!” She paused, both girls watching  her shaking fists, before continuing in a subdued tone, “If...  if what we've learned from Rei is true... about her and Minako-san...  I... Your mere presence would be graciously appreciated.”</p>
<p>Makoto's mind was whirling. <em>If  she's thinking about Rei and Mina... is that how she feels about me?   No... I shouldn't be assuming anything... especially since I feel  like I don't know her very well anymore... not that I did when we  were kids but... </em>“A-ami?”   When Ami looked up, eyes flickering with a small amount of  trepidation, such as a convict might in face of an executioner,  Makoto found that she couldn't bear to disappoint her. With a soft  sigh, Makoto turned and responded, “I'm thinking about it, all  right? Come on, we should go find the others- we'll worry about  whether me, Ruka, or the both of us are returning when it's definite  that the <em>Princess</em> has  a way of returning.”</p>
<p>As Makoto started  walking towards the light forestry, Ami stared at her back in  silence, before abruptly snapping out of her daze and running to  catch up. After a moment of pondering, Makoto suggested, “If  we're all together, couldn't we just use the Sailor Teleport?”</p>
<p>Ami hummed in soft  consideration before answering, “But Saturn's not here. We can  only do it with just all the Inners or all of us combined, right? If  we aren't going to leave Haruka-san, Michiru-san, and Setsuna-san  here, then we need Hotaru-chan's energy, too.”</p>
<p>Realizing the  futility of it, Makoto sighed. “And then there's the crew to  think about, too...”</p>
<p>A  companionable silence settled over them as both mulled over the  possible escape routes that they could use. Every so often, one of  them would offer a possibility, which was then effectively tossed  away by the other, or Ami would redirect them in the right direction  to reach Haruka and Michiru. At one point, Ami tested the  wood by soaking a newly fallen tree with a small tsunami blast. The  trunk promptly obliterated into millions of fragments. Building a  sea-worthy ship would be hard... or impossible.</p>
<p>“Hey, wait a minute.”   Mako chose to take her own advice, and continued once Ami had paused.   “Can't we teleport using Setsuna's staff? If we all hold onto  it...”</p>
<p>Ami sighed and shook her head. “I  considered that, but then I remembered, she told us a messenger from  whoever created her staff took it with them to upgrade it. Right  now, it is effectively in the 'repair shop'.”</p>
<p>A small sweatdrop appeared on the side  of Mako's head. “And she still left to find us...?”</p>
<p>“Setsuna-san isn't completely  handicapped without her staff, you know,” Ami objected, “A  few days ago, we succeeded in escaping a whirlpool with her expertise  navigational skills.”</p>
<p>Mako shrugged indifferently. “Well,  I suppose if you can navigate through time and space, sailing the  ocean blue is like child's play.”</p>
<p>There was a long pause before Ami  finally decided to ask, “W-what do you like, about sailing the  seas, I mean?”</p>
<p>“What do I like?” Mako  hummed thoughtfully as she looked to the treetops for answers.   “Well... I don't know... There's just something about the sea  that's... comforting... in a way that the Kingdom never was. I can't  exactly place my finger on what it is but... mmm...”</p>
<p>“Since Water acts as a catalyst  for Lightning... maybe knowing that you're surrounded by an outlet  for power... is a reassuring thought?”</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section B: Ruka and  Mich</strong></p>
<p>“Hey, let's take a break and  eat. There's some fruit here that looks good to eat.”</p>
<p>Michiru blinked and looked up. Sure  enough, on either side of the pathway Haruka had subconsciously made,  ripe fruit awaited the time to be eaten. “All right,”she  called, “Let's.”</p>
<p>As both of them found suitable seats,  concentrated slices of wind made short work of the stems connecting  the fruit to the trees. A soft, caressing breeze planted them in the  hands of the two Senshi. “Thank you,” Michiru  murmured... which Haruka responded to with a small grunt before  taking a large bite out of the fruit. Sighing softly, Michiru  followed suit in a much more lady-like fashion.</p>
<p>“Do you intend to sail the seas  forever?”</p>
<p>Michiru's sudden question startled  Haruka out of the daze she had been blinking in and out of, but she  shrugged it off and answered, “Sure, if I don't find anything  better.”</p>
<p>“Turning a kidnapping into a  mutiny... are you sure you weren't willing when you left?”</p>
<p>“Who said I wasn't willing?”</p>
<p>“Then why? Why did you leave  your post, knowing it was your duty to protect the Princess? The  throne?”</p>
<p>“Ever occur to you that a  ruffian like me isn't suited for Kingdom etiquette?”</p>
<p>“Yes, actually.” Michiru  paused, as Haruka gave her a bewildered look. “But if that's  your reason... aren't you just running away? I never imagined a  coward could become a pirate captain. Especially one as reputed as  you.”</p>
<p>Anger visibly flashed through Haruka's  eyes, ending as she turned away in a sigh of disgust. “I don't  know whether I should thank you for the compliment, or slap you for  the insult.”</p>
<p>“I'll take neither, if it's the  same to you. A mark of gratitude from a pirate would stain <em>my</em> reputation.”</p>
<p>Haruka stood with  a feral growl. “Then why are you following me? If that's how  you feel, then why did you leave the Kingdom to search for me?”</p>
<p>Michiru scoffed as  she, too, stood up, folding her arms in front of her. “In case  you haven't noticed, you took Minako-san and Rei-san aboard your ship  a few days ago. We were searching for <em>them</em>. We gave up  searching for you as soon as we learned what you were doing.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”  Haruka's eyes narrowed. “And what did the Kingdom say to  that?”</p>
<p>A malicious glint  flickered in Michiru's eyes as she met Haruka's gaze head on. “The  people aren't aware that 'Haruka' became a pirate. They truly  believe that you're working undercover for the Kingdom, familiarizing  yourself with the bad lot so as to properly inform us of danger  should the need arise. They still believe the Senshi of Wind is on  their side.”</p>
<p>Haruka tried to  hide her flinch in vain, plowing on to ask, “And you? What do  you think of me?”</p>
<p>Michiru scoffed  lightly and began to walk away. Once she was a fair distance from  Haruka, she responded, “You're about eleven years too late to  ask what I <em>thought</em> of you.”</p>
<p>Haruka watched  Michiru in silence before snapping out of it and following suit.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section  C: Rei and Usagi</strong></p>
<p>“There, that  should do it.”</p>
<p>Usagi looked down  at herself, examining the intricately woven toga of broad leaves. If  the material hadn't been what it was, it would have sold for a pretty  penny back in the royal marketplaces. Eyes glowing with admiration,  Usagi turned to Rei and started, “Ooh, it looks so nice! Thank  you Rei-chan! Really, you could open a shop and be really popular  with your talent! I just know-”</p>
<p>Rei simply laughed  it off and shook her head. Rustling the crown of Usagi's hair that  wasn't connected to the meatballs, she murmured, “Nah, taking  care of you is enough work as it is. Does it fit right? Your dress  is all in tatters now... so you'll have to wear this for a while.”</p>
<p>Usagi shook her  head vigorously, her smile still wide enough to reach beyond her eyes  alone. “No, no! It's perfect! Thanks a million times more,  Rei-chan!”</p>
<p>To that, Rei  sighed and tugged Usagi's hand, the remains of her dress tucked in  her other arm. “Come on, let's go find the others.”</p>
<p>Nodding, Usagi  easily fell into step with Rei, though she didn't let go of Rei's  hand, even as the Senshi of Fire loosened her hold completely.</p>
<p>The chirruping of  the birds and the rustle of the trees served as a peaceful background  melody while the two traversed the forest. Before long however,  Usagi's curiosity goaded her on to break the companionable silence.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan...?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What  is it?”</p>
<p>A light blush  arose on Usagi's cheeks, even though Rei still kept her gaze facing  front. “How... how far have you gone with Mina-chan?”</p>
<p>If Rei had been  drinking at that moment, all of the liquid would have instantly been  spurted out. As it was, she promptly became redder than a tomato.   “W-what kind of question is that!” After recovering  slightly, she clarified, “That... that's no one's business but  mine and Mina's!”</p>
<p>Usagi pouted  slightly as she leaned her head into Rei's arm. “As your  Princess, I'm obligated to know how serious you are.. before I can  defend you in face of the rest of the Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“You..  still... you don't need to.. we'll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Please,  Rei-chan... answer me?”</p>
<p>The blush was  still extremely evident, but it had calmed down some with the slowing  of Rei's pulse. The silence was stretched taut before Rei sighed and  gave her response in a low tone. “We haven't done anything  beyond kissing. I know she's willing to go farther... and half of me  does too, but...”</p>
<p>Usagi  softly prompted, “...But what?”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head. “I don't  know. When I think of it... something just doesn't feel right.”</p>
<p>As Rei retracted into herself as she  was apt to do, a small smile grew on Usagi's face... and those who  saw her then... might have sworn they saw a glimmer of hope  reflecting in her eyes.</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Section D: Mina and  Sets</strong></p>
<p>“Minako-san? If I  may ask... what exactly were your thoughts, when you boarded the  Zephyr?”</p>
<p>Mina paused mid-step,  before shrugging and continuing on. “My thoughts...? Hmm...  Well, Rei-chan was still first and foremost in my mind at that  point... she was actually the one that suggested a mutiny-”</p>
<p>“Did she really?”</p>
<p>An uneasy chuckle rose from  Mina's throat. “Well... technically she did... but I don't  think she expected me to follow through with it...”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well... We- erm...  mostly <em>I</em>- were really  bored... so I asked her the things I could do on a ship. She started  listing a whole bunch of things, and a mutiny was one of them.”</p>
<p>Setsuna  was quiet for several moments before she questioned, “And  afterwards, Rei-san agreed to it?”</p>
<p>Again,  a nervous laugh emerged. “Umm... at that point, she agreed to  support me in whatever I did... I don't think she <em>actually</em> agreed to a mutiny... though she did a great job of starting to teach  me what it was like to be a pirate!”</p>
<p>A  curious eyebrow was raised. “And Rei-san knew the how-to of  piracy... how?”</p>
<p>At  that, Minako shrugged. “I honestly have no idea. She came up  with several lessons that even Mako-chan and Ruka-chan hadn't thought  of. I asked her about it once, and she only shrugged and said,  'Kami-sama blesses his followers with many gifts, even if you don't  understand or realize most of them.'”</p>
<p>A long  silence followed, before a certain action caught Setsuna's attention.</p>
<p>“Minako-san?”   When the Senshi leader paused in her scratching of a tree trunk,  Setsuna continued, “May I ask what you're doing? You scratched  several marks on the other trees as well...”</p>
<p>Mina  grinned, stepping aside so that a visible arrow could be seen.   “Isn't it obvious? I'm marking the way we went, in case we  start to go in circles!”</p>
<p>Setsuna  coughed lightly into her hand before she pointed to the marked tree  that was next to her. “But Minako-san, I don't believe two  marks fifteen yards from each other should be pointing <em>towards</em> each other... should they?”</p>
<p>Grin  fading quickly, Minako looked between both trees, a sweatdrop growing  on her head as she realized what she was doing. “Ehehehe...  whoops. Sorry. Umm... you wouldn't happen to know which way we're  supposed to go... do you?”</p>
<p>With a  soft sigh, Setsuna simply pointed in the direction they had been  heading, completely ignoring Mina's arrows. Minako took one last  look at her design, before following Setsuna, who had taken the lead  again, as was apparently necessary.</p>
<p>The  arrow... that had pierced a heart... which contained the initials “RH  + MA 4EVER”... would remain as a mark of loving graffiti for  other travelers to see at will.</p>
