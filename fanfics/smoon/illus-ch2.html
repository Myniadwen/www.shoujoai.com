<h1>Moonlit Nights (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illus-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Hello everyone! Please tell us what you think of this story. Please? 
We love to hear from all of you. Please e-mail us.

If you&#39;re wondering who some of the characters are, 
don&#39;t worry. ^-^ Ruruna &amp; Naruru are two of ChibiUsa&#39;s
friends from the manga (who Hotaru thought were trying
to steal ChibiUsa from her ^^). Momoko&#39;s another 
friend of ChibiUsa&#39;s from both the anime and the manga. 
Diana is ChibiUsa&#39;s talking kitten who came back with 
her from the future. She can change into a human, 
though she still has her tail when she does.

Oh, and one last thing. We&#39;re trying to coordinate an 
anthology of Hotaru and ChibiUsa stories, but we need
to get more stories for it. If any authors out there
are at all interested, please e-mail us. Thanks! ^-^

We really hope you enjoy the story. ^^

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;You look beautiful,&quot; Michiru said as Hotaru stepped
down the stairs. She was wearing a black dress with a
satin bow on the back.

Hotaru turned around twice. &quot;Do you really think so,
Michiru-mama?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Michiru answered.  She looked proudly at
the girl she had raised as a daughter.  &quot;Oh Ruka, look
at her. She&#39;s grown into such a pretty young lady.&quot;

Hotaru blushed, Haruka smiled.  There was a flash of
light as Setsuna took a picture. &quot;I just have to make
sure we have a picture of our little girl&#39;s first
dance,&quot; said Setsuna.  &quot;So who&#39;s the lucky young boy or
girl you&#39;re taking to the dance?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m going with Haruka-papa to pick up ChibiUsa-chan
and then we&#39;re heading to the dance,&quot; said Hotaru.
Though ChibiUsa was still pretending they were just
friends, Hotaru didn&#39;t try very hard to keep it a
secret.

&quot;Oh, so you&#39;re taking Small Lady to the dance?&quot; Setsuna
looked at Hotaru knowingly. &quot;She can be quite a
handful. Make sure you two behave and
everything should be fine.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna,&quot; Michiru giggled.

&quot;I have to keep an eye out for our daughter, don&#39;t I?&quot;
Setsuna replied.

Hotaru sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have to worry,
Setsuna-mama. I&#39;m only going to the dance with
ChibiUsa, my best friend.&quot; She put emphasis on &#39;best
friend&#39;. That wasn&#39;t what she wanted to go as.

&quot;Don&#39;t sound too disappointed. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s not bad
company.  And you might meet someone while you&#39;re
there,&quot; Setsuna said.

Hotaru sighed again. &#39;That&#39;s not it.&#39;

 &quot;Are you ready?&quot;  Haruka asked. Hotaru nodded and
stood up.  Michiru and Setsuna followed them to the
car.

&quot;Have fun, Hotaru,&quot; Michiru said as Hotaru got in the
back seat.

&quot;I will. Thanks!&quot; Hotaru waved as they started to drive
away.

&quot;There she is,&quot; Haruka pointed to ChibiUsa waiting in
front of her house. ChibiUsa smiled and started waving
her arms as Haruka pulled up.

&#39;She&#39;s so beautiful,&#39; Hotaru thought.  ChibiUsa had her
hair down. She was wearing a pink dress that fit her well,
covering her shoulders, and with frills at the bottom.
&quot;You look cute,&quot; Hotaru said aloud as ChibiUsa climbed
in next to her.

ChibiUsa smiled happily, glad that Hotaru thought so.
She slowly looked Hotaru up and down, &quot;You&#39;re pretty
tonight.&quot;

&quot;Thank you, ChibiUsa-chan,&quot; Hotaru said. She laughed.
&quot;But you&#39;re supposed to say &#39;you always look pretty&#39;
after that.&quot;

ChibiUsa laughed as well. &quot;Can I pass it this time?&quot;

Hotaru appeared to contemplate for a moment. &quot;No. Not
this time.&quot;

&quot;Okay, then. You always look pretty.&quot;

Hotaru smiled. &quot;Good. Thanks again, ChibiUsa-chan.&quot;

ChibiUsa smiled back at her. &quot;Anytime, Taru.&quot;

Haruka looked into the back of the car with an odd look
on her face. She didn&#39;t remember acting like that when
she was that young. Or rather she did, but with a
certain aqua haired girl. The two of them just hadn&#39;t
been quite as childish when playing around with each
other. It took Haruka a moment to make a connection.

She turned around and stared at the back for a few brief
seconds before turning her attention back to the road.
&#39;No,&#39; she thought. &#39;This is different. They&#39;ve been
best friends since before we raised Hotaru. I&#39;m
probably just looking into it too deeply. I do tease
Hotaru about it a lot, though.&#39; A smirk formed on
Haruka&#39;s face. &#39;What if I was right the whole time?&#39;
She looked back and saw the two of them talking
quietly, whispering to each other and laughing from
time to time.  She noticed they were both holding hands
as well. It wasn&#39;t a big thing in and of itself, but
with how they&#39;d been acting lately, it wasn&#39;t too
difficult for Haruka to take that a step further than
friendly hand holding. Haruka&#39;s grin widened. &#39;It would
be nice to win a bet with Michi for once.&#39;

Both girls started leaning towards each other.  They
sat back quickly as the car turned a corner.

&quot;You two enjoy yourselves,&quot; Haruka said as he stopped
the car by the school.

&quot;I&#39;m sure we will, &quot;Hotaru said.  She leaned over
ChibiUsa and scooted across.  Hotaru grabbed ChibiUsa&#39;s
hand and helped her out.  Neither of them noticed the gray
cat that jumped out of the car after the two of them.

&quot;Hi, ChibiUsa-chan! Hotaru-chan!&quot; Naruru greeted them
as they walked inside.

&quot;Neither of you came with someone?&quot;  Ruruna asked.
&quot;That&#39;s too bad. Don&#39;t worry about it though. C&#39;mon,
Hotaru, we&#39;ve got somebody you can dance with.&quot;

ChibiUsa grabbed onto Hotaru&#39;s arm protectively as
Ruruna and Naruru tried to lead them away. &quot;Hotaru and
I decided to go to the dance together since neither of
us could find anybody.&quot;

&quot;Well, I did find someone. She&#39;s right around here,&quot;
Hotaru looked around before her gaze settled on
ChibiUsa.

Naruru scratched her head nervously and looked down.
&quot;Yeah, same with me and Ruruna.&quot;

&quot;We figured, we both helped organize the dance anyway,
so we might be able to help better if we weren&#39;t busy
here with someone,&quot; Ruruna tried to explain.

&quot;We&#39;re going to make sure everything&#39;s going well.
We&#39;ll see you two around later,&quot; Naruru said.  Ruruna
and Naruru waved before walking away through the crowd
of students.

&quot;You look nervous, ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru said as she and
ChibiUsa stood together.

The pink haired girl smiled at her. &quot;I&#39;m here with
a beautiful girl and I&#39;m not sure what I should do.&quot;

&quot;Well, if you want my advice, kiss her whenever you get
the chance,&quot; Hotaru said innocently. She started
leaning towards ChibiUsa slightly. &quot;Like right now.&quot;

ChibiUsa took a step back. &quot;It&#39;s a little too crowded.&quot;

Hotaru smiled. &quot;I don&#39;t mind.&quot;

ChibiUsa looked at Hotaru for a moment. &quot;You&#39;ve just
been full of surprises lately.&quot;

Hotaru brushed some hair away from her face. &quot;What do
you mean?&quot;

The pink haired girl giggled. &quot;I could have sworn you
were the shy one before all this.&quot;

&quot;I just don&#39;t think you should have to hide it if you
love someone. I love you. I don&#39;t want to pretend any
different.&quot; Hotaru smiled. &quot;Besides, I&#39;ll be the shy
one if you want. I never remember you being this shy
when we were younger, so I&#39;d love to switch places with
you.&quot;

ChibiUsa stood thinking for a moment. &#39;She&#39;s right. I
never used to act like this before we got together. Why
have I been doing that? Because what if someone finds
out? I can tell that Hotaru&#39;s nervous before she does
things a lot of the time, but she&#39;s been going ahead
anyway. Has fear of being found out really changed
things for me?&#39;

&quot;ChibiUsa-chan?&quot; Hotaru asked worriedly. &quot;Are you okay?
I was just kidding.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Taru. Just thinking.&quot; ChibiUsa smiled
brightly and offered her hand to Hotaru. &quot;Let&#39;s dance.&quot;

Hotaru blushed and looked at her for a moment. She took
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand with her own. &quot;Hai. I&#39;d love to.&quot;
ChibiUsa led the other girl onto the dance floor.

Momoko stood against a wall, her lavender hair in its
normal single odango hairstyle. She was wearing a dress
that looked vaguely Chinese and cut off at her lower
thighs.

Momoko looked at ChibiUsa and Hotaru, who were a
bit apart from everyone else.  They seemed to be standing
very close together and getting closer. Momoko couldn&#39;t
make out what they were saying. Finally the two went
off into the crowd.

Standing next to Momoko was a girl in an odd gray and
purple dress with short dark hair.  Momoko was sure
that the other girl was watching Hotaru and ChibiUsa
as well.

&quot;If Hotaru was teaching ChibiUsa to kiss, then she must
have been getting ready for something. Maybe it&#39;s for
someone here at the dance,&quot; Diana thought to herself.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Momoko said, interrupting her thoughts.
&quot;Are you watching those two?&quot;  She pointed towards
ChibiUsa and Hotaru.

&quot;I.. I&#39;m sorry... I should go,&quot; Diana said before she
turned to leave.  A hand grabbed her shoulder, &quot;Don&#39;t
go. I&#39;m sorry if I scared you, but I just wanted to
know if you&#39;re watching them. I am too, and I thought
we could compare notes,&quot; the lavender haired girl said.
&quot;I&#39;m Momoko, a friend of theirs.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m Diana, and so am I,&quot; Diana replied. She knew
Momoko well, though Momoko didn&#39;t know she was
ChibiUsa&#39;s cat.

&quot;That&#39;s strange. ChibiUsa has a cat named Diana,&quot;
Momoko said.

Diana laughed nervously, &quot;I was named after her... I
mean the cat was named after me,&quot; she said hastily.

Momoko laughed, &quot;It&#39;s good to meet you. I hope we can
find out whatever it is we&#39;re both looking for.&quot;

&quot;Me too,&quot; Diana agreed.  She couldn&#39;t help blushing as
she looked at Momoko.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot; Momoko asked.

&quot;H..Hai&quot; Diana answered.  She looked away quickly.
She had had a crush on Momoko for a long time. She&#39;d
known Momoko for quite a while in her cat form. Momoko
was always very nice to her, petting her and giving her
food.  She hadn&#39;t expected to meet Momoko here in her
human form.  &quot;Will you dance with me?&quot; Diana blurted
out.  She blushed as soon as the words were out of her
mouth and looked away.

Momoko blushed as well and coughed into her fist.  She
thought about it. &#39;Well, ChibiUsa and Hotaru are
dancing together. It&#39;s the same thing.&#39; &quot;That&#39;s a good
idea,&quot; she said.  &quot;We can get closer to ChibiUsa over
there and see if we can find out what&#39;s going on.&quot;
This was the first time Momoko had ever been asked to
dance by a girl.  It was... strange.  Plenty of boys had
asked her, though she&#39;d declined. By now at her age most
of the girls had grown out of thinking boys were
stupid, but Momoko still didn&#39;t like them much, even if
Kyosuke was her friend. She looked closely at Diana.
She had dark gray hair done up in four odango. She was a bit
smaller than Momoko and was wearing a tight purple dress
with a ruffled skirt that had a gray skirt beneath it.
She wore lavender stockings and had a bow around her
neck.  Diana looked up at her happily. Both girls
continued to blush as they began to dance together.

Hotaru was a bit shocked that ChibiUsa had asked her to
dance.  ChibiUsa was pretty shy about her relationship
with Hotaru, but Hotaru was shy about it as well, though she
tried not to be.  ChibiUsa was overall more outgoing
than she was and she wished that the pink haired girl
would act that way about the two of them. Hotaru&#39;s line
of thought was interrupted as she felt ChibiUsa&#39;s hand
on her waist.

&quot;ChibiUsa, what&#39;s gotten into you tonight? Not that I
mind though, but I was sure that you wouldn&#39;t want to
do anything like this. I thought I&#39;d be lucky if we
danced at all.&quot; Hotaru said.

ChibiUsa brushed a stray strand of hair away from
Hotaru&#39;s face.  &quot;Well, I&#39;d been thinking about this
a lot over the past two days. I had a lot of fun
dancing with you at Usagi&#39;s wedding a couple of years
ago and I really wanted to dance with you again.  No
one thought it was strange that we were dancing
together then.&quot;

Hotaru giggled. &quot;Yeah, but we were both about ten
back then. Of course no one thought it was strange.&quot;

&quot;Two friends can dance together,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Hotaru agreed.  &quot;But I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t have
the same intentions I have in mind for you after we get
home.&quot;

ChibiUsa blushed.

&quot;And I&#39;m sure most of them don&#39;t plan on spending
the whole dance together.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true,&quot; ChibiUsa conceded. She hesitated a
second before placing her hand on Hotaru&#39;s hip. Hotaru
smiled, and placed her hand on ChibiUsa&#39;s side.
ChibiUsa started to remember the many other dances she
had been to in the future
as a new song began. Mostly formal occasions at the
palace in Crystal Tokyo. The only dance she remembered
fondly was when she&#39;d danced with Hotaru at Mamoru and
Usagi&#39;s wedding.  She wanted to enjoy her time with
Hotaru whether anyone saw them or not.  The two girls
began to dance. Slowly the rest of the world seemed to
fade away, leaving them oblivious to everything but
each other.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Momoko saw ChibiUsa and Hotaru dancing near her.  She&#39;d
forgotten all about them while dancing with the mysterious
girl.  She blushed. &#39;I&#39;ve never felt like this before.
I don&#39;t know why, but it feels like I&#39;ve met her
before. She&#39;s very pretty. She&#39;s a great dancer too.
She seems so innocent. Who is she?&#39; Momoko&#39;s hand slid
down Diana&#39;s back, Diana purred happily, Momoko&#39;s hand
brushed something soft and furry.  It seemed to be
moving in time to the music. Momoko clutched it,
startling Diana. She turned the smaller girl around,
Momoko stared wide eyed at Diana&#39;s tail.  &quot;What... What
is that?&quot; Momoko asked.

&quot;My tail?&quot; Diana asked, confused. She didn&#39;t know why
Momoko was acting so strangely. Suddenly realization
dawned on her.  People didn&#39;t have tails. She kept hers
even in her human form, unlike her parents.  She felt
Momoko tug at  her tail.  Diana pushed away, tears
building up in her eyes.  Things had been going so well
with Momoko and now her tail had ruined everything.
Her vision blurred as she wiped some tears away with
her sleeve.  &quot;I..I&#39;ve got to go..&quot; she said quickly
before heading through the crowd.

&quot;Wait!!&quot; Momoko yelled as she tried to catch up with
her.  &quot;Matte! Don&#39;t go!&quot;  She grabbed for the other
girl, but it was too late. She was already gone.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChibiUsa smiled happily as she continued to dance with
Hotaru. She loved the comforting feel of Hotaru&#39;s hands
on her shoulders. She felt Hotaru&#39;s soft skin through
the thin fabric.

&quot;I just realized something,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

&quot;What?&quot; Hotaru asked the pink haired girl.  She blinked
several times as she brought herself back to reality.
She&#39;d tuned out the rest of the world while they&#39;d been
dancing. &quot;All those banquets and dances are going to be a
lot more fun with you there in Crystal Tokyo,&quot; ChibiUsa
said smiling.

Hotaru smiled back lovingly.  Her face was inches away
from ChibiUsa&#39;s.  Hotaru learned closer.  ChibiUsa turned,
blushing. Hotaru, kissed her cheek lightly and laughed.
&quot;Taru...&quot;

 Hotaru smiled and ran her hand up ChibiUsa&#39;s back.
Her hand reached ChibiUsa&#39;s soft pink hair. She gently
brushed it with her fingers.  &quot;I&#39;m really enjoying the
dance.  Thanks for understanding, ChibiUsa-chan.&quot;
ChibiUsa sighed as they danced.  She could feel
Hotaru&#39;s soft breasts against her.  Her hands lay over
the dark haired girl&#39;s graceful form.

They continued dancing for the rest of the night.
Several boys asked ChibiUsa to dance, but she declined.
Hotaru was glad that she got to spend the whole night
with the pink haired girl.  She held ChibiUsa closer,
enjoying the sweet scent of her hair and the soft feel
of her body.

&quot;I love you, Hota-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa whispered into
Hotaru&#39;s ear.

&quot;I love you too,&quot; Hotaru whispered back.  She noticed
some of the odd looks they received as the two girls
started another slow dance together.  She blushed but
tuned them out and concentrated on the pink haired
girl.  &quot;I had no idea you&#39;d be able to dance as well as
you can,&quot; Hotaru remarked.

&quot;I&#39;ve always had a hard time dancing.  I&#39;m not very
coordinated.&quot;

&quot;I still think it&#39;s cute.&quot; Hotaru winked at her.  &quot;So
how did you learn how to dance?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s kind of embarrassing ,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

&quot;Tell me.&quot;

&quot;There was a banquet being held for some foreign
dignitaries when I was about 10  back in the future.  I
hadn&#39;t really danced at all up to that time, but when
someone asked me, I agreed. I tripped and fell a minute
into the dance.  I sat in a chair the rest of the
night. After it was over I talked with my mom for a
while. She made me feel better about the whole thing.
We stayed up all night and she taught me how,&quot; ChibiUsa
finished.

&quot;Ohhh... That&#39;s so sweet,&quot; Hotaru said. &quot;I can&#39;t wait to
meet Usagi again in the future when she&#39;s your mother.&quot;

ChibiUsa sighed. &quot;Yeah. I miss her. I really like Usagi
and all, but she&#39;s not my mom yet.&quot;

The two of them danced in silence for a short time
before Hotaru hesitantly replied. &quot;You could always ask
Setsuna if she&#39;d let you go to the future for a short
while. I mean, as long as you came back soon.&quot;

ChibiUsa smiled at the purple haired girl.  &quot;Thanks,
Taru but then I&#39;d miss you. When I do go back to my
time I want you to come back with me.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru said in relief. Hotaru had been
frightened of ChibiUsa going to the future ever since
ChibiUsa had left several years ago to go back to her
time.  Hotaru was scared that the future princess would
leave again. &quot;You&#39;re not going to wait until we go to
the future to tell everyone, right? I still want to
tell my parents about us.&quot;

&quot;Sometime soon, Hotaru-chan.  Actually, I think my mom
might have known before I left. Before I met you when I
was coming back to the past, she said something cryptic
about me having a very important encounter in the past.
I wonder if she was talking about you.&quot; ChibiUsa said
thinking of what her mother had said to her.

&quot;I hope so, &quot; Hotaru smiled happily. Crimson eyes met
dark purple ones as the two girls danced.  &quot;Will you
kiss me?&quot; Hotaru asked suddenly.

&quot;Hotaru-chan?&quot; ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes widened at the dark
haired girl&#39;s request.

&quot;I have been pretty well behaved tonight.  I didn&#39;t
have to act like I was just your friend.  I think I&#39;ve
been a good girl and I deserve a kiss,&quot; Hotaru said as
her smile widened.

&quot;You do, and I&#39;ll make sure you get one, but not here.&quot;
ChibiUsa replied.

&quot;I&#39;m impatient,&quot; &quot;Hotaru said. &quot;I may have to steal
one.&quot;

&quot;I thought you said you were a good girl,&quot; ChibiUsa
said.

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t be my fault.  You look so cute dressed up
for the dance,&quot; Hotaru laughed evilly..

&quot;Okay. You did what I want at the dance. I&#39;ll do
whatever you want when we get back to your house.&quot;
ChibiUsa said.

&quot;Really?&quot; Hotaru asked happily. ChibiUsa nodded. &quot;That
sounds fun,&quot; Hotaru giggled. &quot;I still want my kiss
though.&quot;

Momoko sighed as she sat with her back against the
wall.  She was very confused. Who was that girl? Why
had she been at the dance?  What was that tail? Was it
part of her outfit?  She sighed again, she&#39;d tried in
vain to find the girl, but she
had been long gone.  She half-heartedly kept watching
ChibiUsa and Hotaru.  The dance had lost all interest
after the mysterious girl had left.

ChibiUsa and Hotaru giggled, not realizing that Momoko
was looking on.  They looked at each other strangely as
they smiled at one another.  Momoko didn&#39;t know why
they were acting the way they were.  Several couples
danced past, blocking her view. They all looked so
happy. Her mind flashed back to Diana.  She sighed
angrily.  Why couldn&#39;t she get the mysterious girl out
of her mind? She shook her head and tried to clear her
mind. &#39;Where&#39;d she go?&#39;  Momoko asked herself.

The dance finally ended later that night. The students
began to leave the school.  Hotaru and ChibiUsa were
talking in a hallway abandoned by the other students.

&quot;So did you have fun?&quot; Hotaru asked.  ChibiUsa&#39;s hands
ran up and down Hotaru&#39;s cold, bare arms, trying to
warm the dark haired girl.

ChibiUsa smiled at Hotaru. &quot;I had a lot of fun,
Taru-chan,&quot; she said brightly.

&quot;It still would have been better if we&#39;d gone as a
couple,&quot; Hotaru said. She sighed happily as she felt
ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers warming her cold arms.

&quot;I know, I know. And I&#39;m sorry. I got to go with the
prettiest girl here and everyone thought we&#39;d come
without dates.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Hotaru shivered.  &quot;Just as long as you
keep this up. It&#39;s cold.&quot;

ChibiUsa giggled. &quot;Sure. As long as we trade places in
a couple of minutes.&quot;

Hotaru nodded.  &quot;As soon as we&#39;re in Haruka-papa&#39;s car
with the heater on.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re so cute, Hotaru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

Hotaru smiled &quot;So are you.&quot; A finger went under
ChibiUsa&#39;s chin. &quot;I never did get that kiss I wanted.&quot;
She raised her chin and met the pink haired girl&#39;s lips
with her own.  ChibiUsa hands stopped at Hotaru&#39;s
shoulders as she kissed her back.

Momoko froze when she saw ChibiUsa and Hotaru.  She&#39;d
been waiting in the hallway to get away from the other
students so she could collect her thoughts.  She had
been about
to greet her two friends when she saw them kiss. She
stood there in shock.  She didn&#39;t know what to do.
Finally she slid out a door and made her way outside.

A car pulled up near Hotaru as the two girls waved to
the driver.

&quot;Hi, Haruka-papa,&quot; Hotaru said as she and ChibiUsa
climbed into the back of the car.

&quot;How was it?&quot; Haruka asked as she started the car.

&quot;It was really nice,&quot; Hotaru said.

&quot;Thanks for taking us, Haruka-san,&quot; ChibiUsa said.

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it. You two make a cute couple,&quot; Haruka
replied.

Hotaru and ChibiUsa blushed.  &quot;Do you really think so?&quot;
Hotaru asked.  &quot;Don&#39;t worry about Haruka-papa.  She&#39;s
just teasing us,&quot; she whispered to ChibiUsa.  ChibiUsa
relaxed slightly.

&quot;Absolutely.&quot; Haruka laughed.  &quot;I&#39;d be happy to
chauffeur you two on any dates you&#39;d like to go on.&quot;

&quot;Haruku-papa...&quot; Hotaru chided.

Haruka smiled. &quot;I just want the two of you to know the
offer&#39;s open if you do want to go out.&quot;

&quot;Umm...Thanks for the offer,&quot; Hotaru managed.

&quot;You&#39;re welcome,&quot; Haruka said. She smiled to herself
slightly. She still didn&#39;t quite know what was going
on, but she figured she&#39;d find out sometime.

They drove along in silence for a while before Hotaru &amp;
ChibiUsa started talking to each other about the dance.
Haruka smiled to herself as the two girls talked.  They
were so cute together.

The car finally stopped outside the house the outer
senshi shared.  Michiru and Setsuna came out of the
house to greet them.

&quot;Hi, Puu,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily as Setsuna walked up.

&quot;Hello, Small Lady. Did you have a good time?&quot; Setsuna
asked.

ChibiUsa nodded.  &quot;Yeah. It was a lot of fun.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad. Hotaru&#39;s always so happy when she&#39;s going
places with you,&quot; Setsuna said. She turned to see
Hotaru talking excitedly to Michiru about the dance.

&quot;I&#39;m so glad you enjoyed yourself, Hotaru-chan.  Did
you dance a lot?&quot; Michiru asked her.

&quot;Yes.  Only with ChibiUsa-chan, though.  I really
enjoyed myself,&quot; Hotaru said.

Michiru seemed a little confused. &quot;Nobody asked you to
dance?&quot;

&quot;No, someone asked me, but I didn&#39;t want to.  I was
fine with how things were going,&quot;  Hotaru replied.

Michiru smiled, &quot;Well, I&#39;m glad for you then.&quot;

&quot;Thanks. It&#39;s getting late. ChibiUsa-chan and I are
going to change.  We&#39;ll probably take a shower after
that, so we&#39;ll see you all tomorrow. &quot; Hotaru said.

&quot;Okay, goodnight.&quot; Michiru said.

&quot;Goodnight, everyone.&quot;  Hotaru waved as she grabbed
ChibiUsa by the hand and led her upstairs. ChibiUsa
waved as she followed Hotaru.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Momoko sat alone in the dark. She was in her room, but
she couldn&#39;t get comfortable. She was so confused.
She&#39;d found out why ChibiUsa had been acting so
strangely, but now she didn&#39;t know what to do about it.
She wanted to talk to ChibiUsa, but she didn&#39;t know how
to bring it up to the pink haired girl. She&#39;d known
Hotaru and ChibiUsa were close, but she was shocked to
learn just how close they really were.

The other thing troubling her was Diana, the mysterious
girl she had been dancing with. She couldn&#39;t get that
girl out of her mind, even after seeing Hotaru and
ChibiUsa kissing. She felt oddly about how she&#39;d spent
the night with Diana. She didn&#39;t know why, but she was
also afraid she&#39;d never see her again.

Momoko slumped down on her floor and looked out her
window into the night. &quot;Where did you go?&quot; she asked
aloud.

She ran her fingers through her hair, trying to make
sense of the night, but it all seemed so strange to
her. The only thing she knew was that she wanted to see
Diana again.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ChibiUsa hopped back onto Hotaru&#39;s bed when they
entered the room.  She yawned as she laid back,
stretching out on the bed.

Hotaru giggled. &quot;Are you tired?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t get much sleep last night,&quot; ChibiUsa
said.

&quot;Me neither. I was trying to decide what I should do at
the dance,&quot; Hotaru said.

ChibiUsa sat up. &quot;Really?  Why did you decide not to do
anything?&quot;

&quot;It was a tough decision.  I really, really didn&#39;t want
to go as friends. I almost left when Naruru tried to
get us to dance with some boys, but the way you held me
when we slow danced,&quot; Hotaru sighed. &quot;I&#39;ll be surprised
if no one thinks there was something behind it.  I am
the only one you danced with.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;Anyway,
the reason why I didn&#39;t do anything was because I
decided that this is about both of us. I love you and
if that&#39;s all that matters to me, then I shouldn&#39;t care
if no one knew we were a couple at the dance.&quot;

&quot;Arigato, Hotaru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said.  She looked a
bit sad after listening to Hotaru.

Hotaru sat down beside her.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked.

&quot;You almost left,&quot; ChibiUsa said simply.

Hotaru put her arm around the pink haired girl.
ChibiUsa leaned her head on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;It&#39;s
just that I get so frustrated sometimes.  I&#39;m so glad
we&#39;re together, but I didn&#39;t want to be at the dance
with all those people. I was nervous about the whole
thing and I didn&#39;t want Naruru to try to set us up with
different boys the whole time. I hated going to the
dance as friends, but I still had fun.&quot; She smiled at
the other girl.

ChibiUsa smiled slightly. &quot;I&#39;m glad you stayed. Maybe
next time there&#39;s a dance or something, we could go as
a couple,&quot; she said quickly. &quot;I was being kinda
stubborn about the whole thing.&quot;

Hotaru laughed. &quot;We both were. Maybe we can come up
with a better compromise next time.&quot;

&quot;That would be good,&quot; ChibiUsa agreed. &quot;I&#39;m really glad
we went tonight.&quot;

&quot;So am I. Seeing you dressed up for the dance made it
all worthwhile,&quot; Hotaru said. &quot;And I&#39;m glad I finally
got my kiss,&quot; she said quietly before kissing ChibiUsa
again.

ChibiUsa kissed the dark haired girl back passionately,
glad to be alone with her. She let out a startled cry
as she felt Hotaru&#39;s hands moving across the fabric of
her dress, starting to undress her.

Hotaru sat back. &quot;You did say I could do whatever I
wanted, right?&quot; she asked mischievously. ChibiUsa
nodded and blushed as she felt Hotaru taking her bra
off. Hotaru smiled. &quot;Good. Then I&#39;d like to...&quot; Hotaru
paused as if thinking. ChibiUsa sat anxiously. The dark
haired girl&#39;s fingers ran over ChibiUsa&#39;s stomach. &quot;I&#39;d
like to tell my parents, then.&quot;

ChibiUsa stared at her for several seconds.
&quot;Hotaru-chan?&quot;

&quot;You said I could do whatever I wanted,&quot; Hotaru
reminded her pink haired lover.

&quot;But, that&#39;s not what I meant,&quot; ChibiUsa said quickly.

&quot;I know what you meant,&quot; Hotaru cupped ChibiUsa&#39;s
breasts, eliciting a moan from the other girl. &quot;But
what you mean and what you said are two different
things.&quot;

ChibiUsa looked nervous. &quot;But, Hotaru...&quot;

Hotaru laughed. &quot;You did agree.&quot; She smiled and kissed
ChibiUsa again. &quot;Now pull your dress back up. They
should still be downstairs.&quot;

&quot;But I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; ChibiUsa argued.

&quot;Just tell them the truth. That we love each other.
Setsuna&#39;s been your friend for years, you know Haruka
and Michiru really well...&quot; Hotaru replied. ChibiUsa
still didn&#39;t look convinced. &quot;Please? Do this for me,&quot;
Hotaru asked.

ChibiUsa sighed. &quot;Okay, Taru-chan. I will.&quot;

Hotaru hugged her. &quot;Arigato, Odango-chan!&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Haruka had a triumphant grin on her face as Hotaru
finished up. Michiru looked surprised by the news.
Setsuna looked as if it hadn&#39;t really been a surprise
to her at all.

&quot;So the two of you?&quot; Michiru asked.

Hotaru nodded. &quot;Hai. We&#39;ve been together for a couple
of months now. I&#39;m sorry we hadn&#39;t told you all until
now.&quot;

ChibiUsa stood to the left and slightly behind Hotaru.
She&#39;d let the other girl do most of the talking.

Setsuna smiled and took a step closer to ChibiUsa.
&quot;Small Lady, you really shouldn&#39;t worry about it. We&#39;re
all happy for you. You don&#39;t need to be embarrassed
about it. We&#39;re all here for you.&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;re glad you found someone, Hotaru,&quot; Haruka
said, still wearing the sappy grin she seemed to be
directing at Michiru.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru said happily.

&quot;As long as you&#39;re happy, we&#39;re behind you, Hime-chan,&quot;
Michiru said. &quot;You two make a cute couple. Maybe you&#39;ll
let me paint the two of you sometime.&quot;

&quot;And remember, my offer still stands,&quot; Haruka reminded
them.

&quot;I&#39;m glad things have worked out so well for you here
in the past, Small Lady. I&#39;m sure your mother would be
proud of you,&quot; Setsuna told to pink haired girl.

&quot;Thanks everyone,&quot; ChibiUsa said as she gave Setsuna a
hug.

&quot;Our little girl&#39;s growing up, alright,&quot; Michiru said.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After a couple of hours talking with Setsuna, Michiru,
and Haruka about the whole situation, Hotaru and
ChibiUsa were back in bed in Hotaru&#39;s room. They held
each other, their bare bodies pressed against each
other.

&quot;See? I told you it wouldn&#39;t be so horrible,&quot; Hotaru
said.

&quot;You&#39;re right. It wasn&#39;t that bad,&quot; ChibiUsa agreed.

&quot;Good. Then we can tell the Inner Senshi tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Hotaru!&quot;

She giggled. &quot;I&#39;m kidding. We can tell them later. I&#39;m
just glad I don&#39;t have to keep it a secret from my
parents anymore.&quot;

&quot;Yeah. I do feel better now that we&#39;ve told them,&quot;
ChibiUsa said.

&quot;Me too. I hated hiding it from them.&quot;

ChibiUsa smiled. &quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re happy about it.&quot; She
ran her hand through Hotaru&#39;s soft hair before kissing
her. &quot;I love you, Taru.&quot;

&quot;I love you, too,&quot; Hotaru replied while stroking the
other girl&#39;s cheek. The two girls held each other 
before sleep finally claimed them. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Momoko lay still in the dark, confused as ever. She 
didn&#39;t know what to do about anything that had happened 
that night.

&quot;I wish I could see Diana again,&quot; Momoko said aloud.

Diana looked in from where she was perched on the window
sill watching Momoko. She&#39;d felt bad after running off at
the dance. She knew Momoko probably thought she was strange
because of her tail. She&#39;d waited until after the dance and 
followed Momoko home in her kitten form. &#39;She wants to see
me?&#39; Diana asked herself. She meowed and scratched at the 
window. 

The lavender haired girl looked out her window to see the 
kitten sitting there in the moonlight. A slight smile 
played across her features. Even if it was only ChibiUsa&#39;s
kitten, it was nice to have company. She slid the window 
open. The kitten jumped inside quickly, landing on her bed.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Momoko asked, not expecting an 
answer. She scratched the kitten under her chin. &quot;I meant 
I wanted to see human Diana.&quot; Diana meowed again causing 
the other girl to smile again. &quot;I&#39;m still glad to see you,
though.&quot; She picked up the kitten and held her in her arms.
She stroked Diana&#39;s soft fur. The kitten purred softly as 
Momoko sat back on her bed.

&quot;I really don&#39;t know what happened today. It was all so 
sudden. I was trying to find out what ChibiUsa was keeping
from me, but even though I found out, I&#39;m more confused 
than I was back then.&quot; Momoko stopped and sighed. &quot;I met 
this really pretty girl at the dance. She seemed to be
trying to find out the same thing I was, so I thought we 
could help each other. It was so strange, but she asked me 
to dance with her. We danced for a long time and I forgot 
all about what I&#39;d been doing there. It was like I was only 
there to dance with Diana. I loved every second of it. She 
was so cute. And graceful.&quot;

Diana blushed. &#39;She thinks I&#39;m cute?&#39; 

&quot;But it ended suddenly. I don&#39;t understand what happened. I
don&#39;t know if I ever will. Afterwards, she ran off. And it 
hurt. I felt like I&#39;d never see her again, like I&#39;d lost 
something when she&#39;d left. I&#39;ve been sitting here all night
trying to think, but all I can think about it her. I don&#39;t
know why. Well, I didn&#39;t know.&quot; She sighed again and held
Diana closer as she looked into the dark. &quot;I think I&#39;m in 
love with her.&quot;

Diana&#39;s eyes went wide. &#39;Love? She thinks she loves me? But 
that was the first time she met me as a human.&#39;

&quot;I feel like I&#39;ve known her for a long time. I guess you feel
like that when you fall for someone, huh Diana? Like nothing 
else matters besides seeing them again. I want to see her. I 
want to tell her... I&#39;m still not sure what.&quot; Momoko lay back 
on the bed, still stroking Diana&#39;s fur. Diana was shocked. 

Both girls were more confused than ever now. Diana watched 
Momoko as she slept, staying by the lavender haired girl&#39;s 
side throughout the night.
