<h1>Absence (part 60 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch59.html">Back to Part 59</a><pre>Chapter sixty. Or rather, the epilogue. Or if you want, the final part. 
I couldn&#39;t help but add a song to the end of this chapter. Consider it 
the end credits song if this fanfic were a movie. It was a tough 
decision deciding which song to pick, but I figured the one I chose was 
fairly appropriate. Catch you at the end of the fic!

With their leaders dead and their numbers severely diminished courtesy 
of the Sailor Senshi and Tuxedo Kamen, the surviving youma from the 
invading armies went into hiding, disappearing into the large metropolis 
of Tokyo and blending in with the population using their human 
masquerades. While some youma knew the locations of one or two portals 
that would take them back to their home dimension with the correct 
ritual, most did not or lacked even the small magical skill required, 
and were stranded permanently on Earth. Many congregated for safety, 
while others opted to work alone, but the remaining youma never thought 
about rising up for the purpose of revenge against the group responsible 
for their predicament. In the several months that followed the events on 
Tokyo Tower, the marooned youma have still not yet troubled the Sailor 
Senshi.

Sanjuro was eventually rehired by this former employer, the Yokohama 
Daily. His expos&eacute;&#130; entitled &#39;Tokyo: Tourist Capitol of Japan or National 
Death Trap?&#39; proved to be an effective bargaining chip for getting a 
respectable position in the newspaper, and the pictures he did have with 
Rei and the other Sailor Senshi in action helped to confirm the validity 
of his report. Despite his fervent words to the contrary, Sanjuro became 
one of the number one journalists to seek out the more peculiar and 
paranormal based stories, often risking life and limb in the pursuit of 
the bizarre. Many of his fellow reporters made fun of him because of 
this however, but he didn&#39;t let it get him down. Sanjuro had witnessed 
the truth of the world with his own eyes, and nothing his colleagues 
could say could deter him. Nevertheless, regardless of his zeal for the 
weird, he remained faithful to his word and kept Rei and her friends&#39; 
true identities a secret.

Tsubasa floundered around aimlessly in Yokohama for a while, unsure as 
to what to do now that his adventure was over. He attempted to resume 
his former profession of assistant chef at a sushi bar, but as he had 
expected, he became listless and quit only a couple of weeks afterwards, 
needing a purpose to his life; a moral, just, purpose. Tsubasa sought 
out Sanjuro once again, the other man the only person in Yokohama to 
have experienced what he himself had. This turned out to be a wise and 
beneficial decision. Seeing the reporter so intent in investigating the 
strange things in the world, albeit in the relatively paranormal free 
city of Yokohama, Tsubasa found his new vocation, and subsequently the 
sense of purpose he was seeking in his life. Sanjuro armed Tsubasa with 
a camera to help him out in his reports, and after proving to have 
something of a knack in shooting snapshots, the man deciding to become a 
freelance photographer, though he mainly worked for the Yokohama Daily. 
With Sanjuro, Tsubasa also sought to reveal the true world to the people 
but rather than through writing, he did it through pictures instead. 
Tsubasa and Sanjuro ended up forming a close friendship due to the 
private understanding they had of the evil things that existed in 
reality, and of their joint crusade to enlighten the population and 
perhaps even make a difference. Tsubasa eventually got over his crush 
for Rei, but it took time, and still the girl never strays far from his 
thoughts. He is still single.

Haruka recovered completely from her encounter with Thrinakie but was 
sorely disappointed she had missed out on the final and destructive 
battle that took place on Tokyo Tower. She enjoyed Michiru consoling her 
however. The Outer Senshi house was also repaired completely from the 
damage it had sustained during the fight between Sailor Pluto and the 
Silent Blades, with Michiru holding no blame towards Setsuna for the 
destruction. However, she did request that the next time Setsuna should 
take all fights outside.

Ami and Makoto&#39;s relationship continued to flourish despite Luna&#39;s 
objections. Ami regularly sleeps over at her girlfriend&#39;s apartment, 
disliking the fact that the brunette lives alone. Makoto sometimes 
spends the night over at Ami&#39;s place too, the Senshi of Water&#146;s mother 
very accepting of the two girls&#146; love for one another and not asking 
prying questions about what they do in her daughter&#39;s bedroom at night, 
for which both senshi are very thankful. Neither Ami nor Makoto ever put 
the other&#39;s life above their duty to protect Usagi despite Luna&#39;s 
misgivings, but it didn&#39;t adversely affect their relationship either, 
though at times it made decisions hard.

Yuuichirou remained Rei&#39;s faithful lapdog in spite of the miko&#39;s new 
relationship with and obvious love for Usagi, staying at the Hikawa 
Jinja. He sometimes spies on the pair when they are spending intimate 
time in each other&#39;s company in the Fire Senshi&#39;s bedroom, for which he 
gets severely reprimanded by an incensed Rei. Calls of &#39;hentai!!&quot; can 
sometimes be heard coming from the shrine several blocks away, and 
Yuuichirou often sports a black eye or two.

Chibi-Usa resided by Hotaru&#39;s bedside as often as she could throughout 
her best friend&#39;s recuperation of the injuries she had received from 
Makareus. Hotaru didn&#39;t mind in the least. Their relationship is 
blossoming slowly, with only innocent gestures of affection for one 
another being exchanged between them, but it is enough fodder for Usagi 
and Haruka to relentlessly tease Chibi-Usa and Hotaru respectively. But 
Rei and Michiru are quick to discipline their significant others. As if 
some sort of bond had formed between them on that night in the darkened 
hallways of the youma headquarters, Hotaru often seeks out Minako for 
advice about various topics, ranging from Chibi-Usa to more routine 
things. Hotaru finds the Senshi of Love&#146;s counsel helpful at times and 
at other times... not so helpful, which usually results in a dejected 
Senshi of Rebirth and an annoyed Chibi-Usa yelling at Usagi to &#39;talk&#39; to 
her &#39;interfering&#39; blonde friend. But Hotaru and Chibi-Usa&#39;s budding 
relationship persevered through all these obstacles, and their cute 
behaviour is adored by all.

Setsuna and Minako entered a tentative romantic relationship that 
proceeded at a very slow pace, both entering new territory and rather 
unsure of themselves. Since it seemed that everyone was swinging that 
way, Minako agreed to give it a try with the older and wiser Guardian of 
Time, the curse she suffered from Saijou Ace not getting her down, and 
cited that the woman was beautiful after all even though her switching 
teams would be a tragic loss to the entire male population, which she 
was sure they were all mourning. Besides, Setsuna was a fashion 
designer, and who better to be head model for her new outfits than the 
Goddess of Love and Beauty herself? It is a match made in Heaven, in 
Minako&#146;s opinion. Setsuna on the other hand found pleasant and welcome 
company in the lively Minako, the girl&#39;s totally opposite personality 
offsetting her own calm and reserved one nicely, rather than causing a 
hindrance to their relationship. However, Setsuna and Rei&#39;s close 
friendship continues to thrive, and while her love for the Fire Senshi 
has dimmed, the Guardian of Time has always kept a special place in her 
heart for the fiery girl. It still remains to be seen wheter it will 
work out between Minako and Setsuna.

Luna still complains now and then about Rei and Usagi&#39;s love. No one 
listens, but Artemis comforts her.

Mamoru sunk into a depression that lasted about a week and shut himself 
off from his friends during that time. However, as he sat in his 
apartment and dwelled on Usagi, Rei, and the past, he came to the 
realisation that it wasn&#39;t only the Moon Princess who had been freed 
from her fate. Mamoru had also gained the ability to fashion his own 
destiny, his own unique path in life. With this new insight in mind, he 
decided to start living his life how he chose, the fresh drive within 
him helping to get him out of his funk and also to start down the long 
road of getting over Usagi. Mamoru stayed good friends with the Sailor 
Senshi, and is even considering dating again.

With their whole immortal lives to spend together and to bask in their 
newly acknowledged feelings for one another, Rei and Usagi&#39;s 
relationship became a passionate, intense, affair but was also one 
filled with compassion, tenderness, and of course, love. They still 
fought and squabbled however, but the affection they felt for each other 
was clearly detectable even in their arguments, which were also all 
usually forgotten in the next few minutes after their conclusion. Rei 
and Usagi did get into serious disputes too, as all couples do, but most 
were quickly resolved with the odango atama starting to cry and the Fire 
Senshi caving like a house of cards. And in the times Rei wouldn&#39;t budge 
from her position no matter what, it was more often than not because she 
was right and Usagi knew it, resulting in the blonde eventually 
reluctantly conceding.

The bond between Rei and Usagi that had been transferred from Mamoru to 
the Senshi of Fire served as a useful indicator of the blonde&#39;s moods if 
they were intense enough, which saved the miko from many a quarrel and 
visa versa, the bond working both ways to hint to the Moon Princess how 
her bodyguard was feeling also. But the main use for it Rei discovered 
was a form of alarm that warned her when her love was in danger. Rei 
took up the mantle of Mamoru&#39;s past role of a shadowy defender of Usagi 
that showed up on the scene at just the right moment to offer aid and 
turn the tide of the battle. The Fire Senshi did like to think her 
little speeches, or rather, witty puns and cool declarations of 
impending fiery doom were better than the prince&#39;s however. Plus she 
tended to stick around longer until she had fried everything to a crisp 
instead of sometimes leaving the fight prematurely. Rei was a fortune in 
taxi fares though; being driven around all over Tokyo to bail Usagi out 
of trouble on the rare occasion she wasn&#39;t with her lover was expensive.

Rei&#39;s memories of her visit to Crystal Tokyo became foggy in the next 
several months, the girl starting to remember little details that hadn&#39;t 
seemed to matter at the time. She mainly recalled a strange feeling that 
had come over her during the meeting with King Endymion that told her 
that he was hiding something, or even lying; the way he shifted his eyes 
frequently behind his mask piquing her senses. There were other things 
too; alone not amounting to anything, but when added up painting a 
picture that didn&#39;t match the future she and her friends had been told 
about by the King and had seen themselves. Rei knew from Setsuna that 
due to the changes made in the present their memories could be altered 
by Time to prevent paradoxes, but the weird fact was that by the miko&#39;s 
recollection there was hardly any difference in them at all. Was it 
because she had already forgotten the original memories and she just 
believed her mind still contained them? Rei didn&#39;t know, but the small 
discrepancies in her account of the time spent in Crystal Tokyo were the 
least of the apparent adjustments.

Chibi-Usa remained still alive and well and in existence, and although 
she had been extremely upset about Rei and Usagi&#39;s love at first, as the 
weeks went by she became more and more accustomed with it, until she 
accepted her future mother&#39;s feelings for the Fire Senshi as if it were 
the most natural thing in the world. However, that wasn&#39;t the most 
disturbing aspect about the pink-haired girl&#39;s newfound understanding. 
Chibi-Usa sometimes referred to Rei as her mother. The first time she 
had done that, Rei had almost swallowed her tongue. It seemed that all 
of Chibi-Usa&#39;s prior affection for Mamoru had been transferred to the 
miko instead, much to Usagi&#39;s irritation. The future princess still held 
some level of fondness for the Prince of Earth however, but now referred 
to him as &#39;uncle&#39;. Mamoru seemed to be glad of this but at the same time 
saddened as well. When questioned about her role reversal between Rei 
and Mamoru, Chibi-Usa gave a jumbled explanation about her mother, 
Neo-Queen Serenity, using the Ginzuishou because Mars and her couldn&#39;t 
wait for Mercury&#39;s method, and had also mentioned something about the 
Senshi of Water only having X chromosomes to work with. It didn&#39;t take a 
genius to deduce that Chibi-Usa was no longer Mamoru and Usagi&#39;s 
daughter, but rather Rei and Usagi&#39;s. The miko had wondered which one of 
them had carried the child to term. Usagi, of course, Rei had surmised. 
Or rather had hoped. Oddly, Chibi-Usa&#39;s personality and appearance 
remained the same however, despite her having a different parent. Rei 
hadn&#146;t been sure what to make of that.

And so, it looked like Fate had granted Rei and Usagi the futures they 
had so desired, which both girls were very gratified about. Rei pledged 
her life to her princess, a pledge not made out of duty, but out of her 
undying love for the girl. She never took Usagi for granted and always 
supported her when it counted. The Senshi of Fire&#39;s love for her angel 
didn&#39;t diminish in the slightest, burning strong in her heart like an 
eternal flame that could never ever be extinguished. And Usagi matched 
Rei&#39;s intense love, her own feelings on par with the level of the 
miko&#39;s. Twice Rei had &#39;died&#39;, and the Moon Princess could not handle a 
third time. Usagi became just as protective of Rei as the miko was of 
her, often throwing herself into danger for the girl&#39;s sake, which 
exasperated and worried the Fire Senshi to no end.

The ultimate future of Rei and Usagi&#39;s relationship still remains to be 
seen, but they simply live each day as it dawns, content in their deep 
love for each other and secure in the fact that they had challenged 
Destiny and had conquered it. If the power of Fate itself could not stop 
their love, then what force in nature and beyond could? Rei and Usagi 
didn&#39;t know, but if any power in the universe thought it could, the Moon 
Princess and the Sailor Senshi of Fire dared it to try.

******

&quot;Usagi, when did you first start feeling something for me?&quot; Rei asked as 
she loosened her arms around her princess and looked at the girl. &quot;You 
never told me.&quot;

Usagi looked up at the sky with a contemplative expression for a second, 
before a slow smile began to curl up her dainty mouth. &quot;I think it was 
not too long after your &#39;funeral&#39;,&quot; she said, nodding to herself, 
certain. &quot;I missed you a lot and thought I would never get the chance to 
see you again and tell you all the things I had wanted to. And that 
really made me feel sad, sadder than I had ever felt before. I had never 
experienced such pain.&quot; She returned her gaze to Rei as her smile became 
a big wide grin. &quot;I guess the saying&#39;s true,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;&#39;Absence 
makes the heart grow fonder.&#39;&quot;

Rei returned her love&#39;s smile, before moving to capture the lovely 
girl&#39;s lips once more with her own. That it did.

******

I never really feel quite right
And I don&#39;t know why, all I know is something&#39;s wrong,
Every time I look at you, you seem so alive.
Tell me how do you do it,
Walk me through it,
I&#39;ll follow in every footstep.
Maybe on your own you take a cautious step,
Do you wanna give it up?
But all I want, is for you to

SHINE,
SHINE down on me,
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out.

I say a lot of things sometimes that don&#39;t come out right
And I act like I don&#39;t know why,
Guess a reaction&#39;s all I was looking for, yeah.
You look through me,
You really knew me,
Like no one has ever looked before.
Maybe on your own you take a cautious step,
Do you wanna give it up?
But all I want, is for you to

SHINE,
SHINE down on me,
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out.

I know, I know, girl you got something.

SHINE (Shine it on to me)
SHINE down on me, (I wanna feel it)
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out.

Maybe on your own you take a cautious step,
Do you wanna give it up?
But all I want, is for you to

SHINE,
SHINE down on me, (Just show me something)
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out. (You give me something that I 
never know)

SHINE (It&#39;s going right down to you, if you can show me your way)
SHINE down on me, (I wanna know what&#39;s going on in your mind)
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out.

Don&#39;t you know I want you to

SHINE,
SHINE down on me,
SHINE on this life that&#39;s burning out.

The End.


Author&#39;s ramblings:

And so ends my first fanfic. It has been quite a ride. In retrospect, 
maybe I should have started off with something smaller. ^_^ The ending 
song is the full version end credit theme of the anime series Hellsing 
called &#39;Shine&#39; by Mr. Big, and can be found on the Raid soundtrack. Yes, 
I know I took the easy way out for the Chibi-Usa situation, but that way 
is the most realistic and is so blatantly obvious it would be too hard 
not to do it.

I would like to thank everyone who took the time to read my (very) long 
fanfic, with extra thanks to those of you who reviewed (especially you 
regular reviewers, you know who you are). I&#39;m not sure how many people 
read this story from the very start sometime in February, but even more 
thanks to you lot for lasting to the end (if any ^_^). Without people&#39;s 
support... well, I probably wouldn&#39;t have stopped writing the fic, but I 
sure would have been a lot less enthusiastic about it.

Special thanks to some of my more... (I don&#39;t want to say inane, but.) 
inane ^_^ friends for letting me view them in their natural habitat and 
for proceeding to give me lots of material for Sanjuro&#39;s dialogue. ^_^

Thanks to AnimeLyrics.com for the impromptu translation of Kimi ga Iru 
(even though it&#39;s slightly wrong -_-). Oh, and that song is from the end 
credits of Initial D: Second Stage. I like end credit songs. ^_^

And of course, my inspiration, the one who holds *my* heart; lots of 
love and thank yous with kisses to my girlfriend who put up with me 
typing away like a maniac late at night on the PC, and also typing away 
like a maniac in bed on my laptop too (while she was trying to sleep no 
less). ^.^ Also, extra special thanks to her for listening to my ideas 
for this fanfic even though when it comes to anime she doesn&#39;t know what 
on earth I&#39;m talking about; she still tries her best to help me anyway. 
God bless her. ^_^

That&#39;s all the thanks I need to give I think. If I&#39;ve forgotten anyone, 
I apologise. Now... those of you who aren&#39;t interested in my ramblings 
about stuff about this fanfic can leave now. I hope you read my next 
story! ...Anyone still here? Oh, you two sitting at the back, huh? Okay, 
here I go...

*clears throat* Right, my initial motivation behind Absence was due to 
the fact that I got really, really tired of never being able to find any 
Rei/Usagi stories that I hadn&#39;t read already, until it came to the point 
that I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore and decided to write one myself. I 
really liked Byakko Rei&#39;s (*waves* ^_^) fanfic, &#39;Of Demons And Love&#39;, 
and wanted to also write a fanfic that was long and good and of course 
involved Rei/Usagi. However... in most of the Rei/Usagi fanfics I had 
read Chibi-Usa either wasn&#39;t addressed or was born as a result of Mamoru 
knocking up Usagi before they broke up, or something like that. Plus, 
Mamoru was usually a bad guy or dead. I wanted to write a Rei/Usagi 
fanfic that dealt with these issues in a different way that didn&#39;t 
result in character death and with Rei being one of Chibi-Usa&#39;s birth 
parents. I also wanted to insert genres I liked into the story too, 
namely angst and action, the latter being pretty rare in Rei/Usagi fics 
that&#39;s for sure. I didn&#39;t want to make it easy for Rei and Usagi to get 
together either; both of them simply declaring their love for one 
another near the start wouldn&#39;t have been as good. Plus I wanted to 
limit the number of angles Rei/Usagi naysayers could use to say the 
relationship could never work out. And so, I thought up a plot and then 
set to work. I never expected it to be this long though!

I was going to analyse parts of this fic, like explanations behind 
Lazarus&#39; behaviour and the true workings of his mask, but I&#39;ll leave 
that to all the readers interpretations. Unless you *really* want the 
inside info real bad. ^_^

Some alternate endings I had considered when I thought up the plot were: 
1) Rei getting sucked into the other dimension and being trapped there, 
forcing Usagi to realise her love and searching after her. 2) Both Rei 
and Usagi being sucked into the other dimension and then both of them 
fighting to survive in the other world, and in turn finding love. 3) 
Usagi not reviving Rei after she gets run through by Makareus, leaving 
Usagi alone and the blonde taking up Rei&#39;s mantle of only loving her 
true love (Rei) and no other for the rest of her life (i.e. Usagi is 
angsty forever).

Now... Absence may be over, but do not despair. I have sowed the seeds 
for a &#39;sequel&#39; (I use the term loosely). It&#39;s more like a Sailor Moon 
fanfic based in the happy Absence universe I&#39;ve created. It will take 
place several months after the events of Absence, and will focus on 
Rei/Usagi (naturally) and Minako/Setsuna, but with bits of Ami/Makoto 
and Michiru/Haruka, and a blossoming Hotaru/Chibi-Usa. There will of 
course be angst, action, romance, and all that good stuff. I&#39;ve already 
thought out the plot pretty much, and also have a title that I&#39;m still 
mulling over, however I won&#39;t write this fic until after my Noir one 
(and I might write that SM comedy fic before that). I&#39;ll be starting the 
Noir fanfic after I revise Absence fully into a final version. Basically 
I want to fix the multitude of mistakes I left behind and bring up the 
early chapters to the standard of the later ones. I might also add a 
prologue from Setsuna&#39;s POV and a few extra scenes. Oh, and phase out 
the thought bubble thingys and fix the formatting issues. But don&#39;t 
worry, you don&#39;t have to read this fic again; it&#39;s more or less 
finished. ^_^

Ah, still here? Good. For those of you who read my ramblings fully (or 
just scrolled down the page -_-), here&#39;s a little extra for you. Thank 
you very much for reading and I hope you read my next fanfic!!

Omake:

Rei flopped backwards onto her futon in her bedroom at the Hikawa Jinja 
and sighed blissfully. Everything was just perfect. Life certainly was 
great. Usagi had invited her out to a picnic in the park on Sunday, and 
also to dinner earlier on Friday night with her parents. Apparently 
Ikuko had told her daughter to invite her girlfriend to dinner since she 
wanted to get to know the miko better. Rei suspected it would be a 
lesson in mortification, but she had readily agreed; not even Usagi&#39;s 
mother&#39;s impending onslaught of relentless prying coupled with the 
woman&#39;s total lack of shame or tact could bring the Fire Senshi&#39;s mood 
down. She sighed in ecstasy again, gazing up at the ceiling, missing her 
princess already.

Suddenly, Rei&#39;s bedroom door was slid open with such force a loud bang 
resounded around the room, startling the raven-haired girl and making 
her bolt upright. Her Grandpa was standing in the doorway, waving about 
a piece of paper in his hands furiously.

&quot;REI!! YOU HAVEN&#39;T BEEN TO SCHOOL IN NEARLY THREE WEEKS!!&quot;

Rei blinked for a second, before the only response she could think of 
came to her mind. &quot;Eep,&quot; she squeaked.</pre>
