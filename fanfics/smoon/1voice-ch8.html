<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not all blondes are created equal, and Rei <em>really</em> didn’t know what to do with the one in her arms, for the one on her  mind, she knew, was casting a rather dangerous glare in her general  direction.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader of the senshi was perched on the balcony of  Serenity’s private courtyard, her back to a pillar, her feet dangling  over the balcony’s edge. She aimed for casual indifference as she  examined how Rei interacted with the others in general and with their  Princess specifically. She could have been a leader observing her  troops. Conversely, if Martians were known for their possessiveness,  Venusians were known for jealousy, and she could have been a jealous  woman keeping an eye on what she deemed was hers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even she didn’t know which of the two was truer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Princess of the Moon Kingdom snuggled deeper into Rei’s arms. “Did you  know,” she asked as she looked at the others, “that Rei-chan is Sailor  Mars?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto nearly spat out the drink she’d been sipping. “What? When did this happen?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Five  Lunar days ago.” Serenity said smugly. “We couldn’t announce it earlier  because afterwards, Rei-chan ran off to bring Minako back from Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei and Minako blushed and turned their heads in opposite directions.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Five days ago!?” Makoto looked to an unfazed Ami. “This doesn’t surprise you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” the blunette began nervously, “I knew Rei-san wasn’t normal-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  snicker from a distance caused Rei to bristle and she shot her eyes to  Minako. “Nothing out of you.” She barked as she tried to peel the  exuberant Princess from her body. “Stop taking things out of context!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-because of the sensing powers she displayed on Jupiter.” Ami was quick to continue. “That kind of tipped it off for me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you could have told me.” Makoto said with a slight pout.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ooh, lover’s spat.” The voice in the back said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The tall brunette shot a glance to her leader. “Nothing out of you!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako sighed and crossed her legs. “Must be one of those days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  small, genuine smile touched the Venusian’s lips as she examined her  team. Never before had her group felt so… complete, a completeness that  had only come to fruition when Rei had stumbled into her life… into <em>their</em> lives. Minako noted the gentle softening of the Priestess’ fierce,  amethyst eyes, a response she knew was similar to, but not nearly as  drastic as the one she’d received from the crimson warrior on several  occasions, and she wanted to believe that the Martian felt the same way  for her new comrades too.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako rose from her perch and  approached her soldiers and her Princess. Ami and Makoto’s mock  squabbling came to a cease-fire. The Princess detached herself from Rei  and retreated to a spot on the grass. The Venusian inserted herself  into the middle of the courtyard, not as their friend, but as their  commander.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lets talk of our next steps regarding the youma.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ever  Minako’s equal, Rei had no problem asserting her opinion. “We’ve  searched the planets closest to the Earth, but what of the others?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami fidgeted slightly. “The planets of the outer rim-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keh!” Minako crossed her arms in a huff.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“-have their own senshi.” Ami continued. “Their reports indicate that the youma invasion has reached as far as Neptune.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Wonderful.” Minako groaned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian watched the dynamics between the Venusian and the Mercurian with a confused sense of interest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Their leader will blame me,” Minako clarified bitterly, “blame <em>us</em>, for allowing a problem that began in the inner reaches of the solar system, to expand to the outer reaches.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mina-chan and Haruka-san don’t get along very well, you see.” Serenity added helpfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto snorted. “<em>That’s</em> putting it mildly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  frown deepened. “Anyway, I’m sorry, Princess, but we can no longer err  on the side of coincidence when it comes to the Earth’s involvement in  the matters at hand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity frowned. Her eyes dropped to the  ground. All four of her guardians looked elsewhere lest their better  judgment be clouded by their Princess’ disappointment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“All of  our clues point to the blue planet.” Minako said quietly. “The access  points found on each planet’s pole seem to be of Earth make. Rei  insists that the signatures of the five individuals we saw time and  again were definitely human. Ami-chan is still researching the data,  but we believe that the location that the access points were pointed to  in order to transport the youma from was Earth as well.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This  whole thing reeks of that damned planet.” Rei spat, and then had the  decency to look sheepish once scolded by Minako’s reprimanding glare.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Still,”  the leader of the senshi said cautiously, “this will be a touchy  political issue, and there is already word that there is a large amount  of civil unrest on Earth. It’s widely known that the Earthlings harbor  mistrust against the Moon Kingdom.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami nodded. She called to  life her transparent super computer and wasted no time in analyzing  data. “We must also keep in mind that the youma are not a native Earth  species.” She examined Rei and Makoto’s blank expressions and chose to  clarify. “That means the youma have technically invaded <em>their</em> planet as well, and though it must mean that someone is controlling  them to their own ends, we don’t know who that person is, and even if  it <em>is</em> an Earthling, we can’t condemn the entire race of humans for it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity rose on shaky legs. “We must meet with their Prince. We must initiate diplomatic relations with the Earthlings.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako eyed Serenity warily. “But Princess-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Endymion  will talk to us like he did before, and both our peoples will benefit  from opening communications again.” There was a childish longing in  those big, blue eyes, but there was also wisdom there, waiting for its  chance for Serenity to lead her people. “We can’t just leave them in  the dark and make their decisions for them.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako hung her  head. “You’re right, Princess. And under the conditions of our previous  treaty, we can’t even step foot onto their planet without their advance  knowledge.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It would only serve to create more unrest if we did.” Ami agreed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Of  one mind, Rei cracked her knuckles and Makoto paced. This plan went  against their fighting instincts and their displeasure was clear. Left  up to them, they would storm the planet and get their answers first  hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mercury,” Minako’s authoritative voice shook everyone in  the courtyard, “continue your research. I want an update at thirteen  hundred hours.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned to her two rogue warriors, “Mars, as a senshi, you are to join in guard patrols. Jupiter will show you the ropes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Assignments  given, Minako turned, expecting her senshi to disperse, but a voice  caught her off guard. She turned and frowned. The Martian lingered  boldly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And you?” Rei asked. “No solo more missions, I trust?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  turned to meet Rei’s amethyst gaze. The smile that touched her lips was  soft. “No solo missions. I will take personal guard duty of the  Princess, and she and I will make plans to contact the Earthling Prince  and his entourage.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You are dismissed.” The Venusian smiled at her subordinate mischievously. “For now.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Fourteen hundred hours wasn’t the most exciting time on the grounds of the Moon Palace.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  been told it was a kind of siesta, a time when the population at large  rested in their shops and homes for several hours before gearing up for  evening activities.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It didn’t make much sense to the Martian, but  then, not much about this strange, new place did, and she continued her  patrol of the western edge of the Moon Palace regardless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  walked forward confidently, amethyst eyes scanning in all directions,  ever on the lookout. She turned a corner and that confident strut  stumbled slightly upon finding herself at a dead end. Jupiter may have  taught her the beat pretty well, but she figured her own sense of  direction could use some improvement.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just as she was about to  return to the main thoroughfare, a pair of strong arms wrapped around  her waist and she was pulled back into a supple, welcoming body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  tensed. She felt the flame of her powers ready themselves at her  disposal. But at the last second, she fought that fight or flight  instinct, and relaxed into the arms she knew belonged to Venus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Didn’t sense my approach?” Venus purred coyly as she laid a hot kiss to the back of Mars’ neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t  always detect… the one who’s already… flooded your senses.” The  Martian’s words were halting as she succumbed to the Venusian’s  ministrations.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hnn. I <em>like</em> that answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  tipped her head back onto Venus’ shoulder as the golden warrior’s hands  splayed themselves across the hollow of her stomach. Wet lips traveled  to the side of her neck, and up to her ear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian fought  for her sense of awareness in the tumult of unexpected desire she felt.  “What of the meeting with the Earthlings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Three Lunar days from  now, they’ll arrive.” The response was rushed, and as her lips were  preoccupied with speaking, Venus allowed her hands to make up the  difference, one traveling north, caressing the area beneath the  Martian’s breasts, and the other traveling south to the crimson  warrior’s hip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus…” Mars growled with wavering resolve, “I’m supposed to be on patrol. You’re <em>not</em> being a very good commander.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh? I think I’m being a <em>great</em> commander.” Gloved fingers trailed along Mars’ thigh for emphasis.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus…” Mars’ breath hitched in her throat, somewhere between a plea and a complaint.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm? But I’ve already patrolled this section <em>for</em> you, Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian’s body finally relaxed. “You’re incorrigible, <em>Mina</em>.” She half-scolded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  then she turned the tables, spinning in the Venusian’s hold and swiftly  pressing the golden warrior’s back against a stone wall before she slid  a knee between the other woman’s welcoming thighs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re one to talk.” Venus purred right before Mars claimed her lips roughly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The four senshi, finally together for the first time, stood guard around their Princess in the marble lined reception hall.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury  and Jupiter – wisdom and courage, flanked Serenity’s right side, and  Venus and Mars – love and passion, flanked her left. But the Princess  herself was the one who rose to her full height. In a flowing, white  gown, she was every bit the kind and fabled Princess she was portrayed  to be by the peoples of her kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t this be a job for the Lunar diplomats?” Mars growled low enough for Venus’ ears only.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior smirked. “We <em>are</em> the Lunar diplomats.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Wonderful</em>.” The Martian spat.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus snorted and smoothed out her skirt. “Do I look presentable?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  embody the attributes you wish to project, if that’s what you mean.”  Mars said. What went unsaid, but which was implicitly understood, was  that Mars could see through Venus’ mask to her mistrust of the humans.  They were emotions that mirrored her own darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity shifted  her weight from one foot to the other. The leader of the senshi elbowed  her discreetly. “Stand tall, Princess. I’m sure Endymion’s missed you  as much as you’ve missed him.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars frowned. “You shouldn’t encourage her. You don’t know his intentions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus only smirked. “Zip it, Rei. Here they come.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Led  by a tall and handsome man adorned in a flowing cloak and upper body  armor, the sounds of booted heels and the rough Earthian language  snapped the senshi to attention, and they waited for the Prince and his  entourage to approach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah, the Prince and his four lackeys, the shittenou are pretty faces with easily forgotten names.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars  knew that Venus’ quietly whispered words were for her sake. There had  been little time for the new senshi to involve herself with learning  who she was about to meet, but her leader’s manner of explanation  bothered her. She glared at the men the Venusian had called beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A gentle hand touched the Martian’s elbow. “Oh come now, possessive one. I didn’t mean it like that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars broke her dark glare to gaze at her leader. She met that smirk with one of her own. “Zip it, Minako.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  group of six humans came to a halt a respectable distance away from the  Princess of the Moon. Venus bridged that gap as both leader and  diplomat, and began the introductions required by etiquette.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Her  Majesty, Princess Serenity of the Moon Kingdom,” she began, and  Serenity bowed her head slightly. “Sailors Mercury and Jupiter,”  Mercury bowed respectfully and Jupiter nodded, her arms crossed over  her chest. “Sailor Mars,” Rei only frowned, “and Sailor Venus.” Minako  tipped her head in introduction to the Earth Prince. “It is good to see  you all again, and the Moon Kingdom welcomes and honors your arrival.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  rogue human, a tall woman with shockingly red hair, and the only female  of the entourage, stepped before her Prince and his four guardians.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“His  majesty, Prince Endymion, ruler of Earth.” Endymion’s eyes firmly  locked on Princess Serenity’s and he bowed deeply. “Kunzite, leader of  Earth’s Mid-Eastern Lands,” a tall man with long, white hair merely  smirked, “Zoisite, of the European Lands,” a slender man with a long  pony tail nearly curtsied, “Nephrite, of North America,” a man of  stocky build with dark hair only frowned, “and Jadeite, of the  Far-Eastern Lands,” the wispy frame of a blonde haired boy bowed  slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus narrowed her cerulean eyes, “And you, ma’am, who might you be?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Beryl.” The woman nearly sneered. “Prince Endymion’s advisor and tactician. And what is your rank, little girl?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior rose above the taunt and refused to take the bait. “I am Venus, leader of Princess Serenity’s senshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Meeting  the tactician’s beady gaze, the Venusian was unfaltering and neither  woman was willing to bend. Finally, Beryl smiled. The gesture didn’t  reach her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nice skirt, Venus.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden warrior  showed no outward offence at the poorly disguised insult. Instead, she  motioned for their guests to follow her down the hallway. Over her  shoulder, she addressed Beryl in particular,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take your place, <em>tactician</em>.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Despite  the large number of people gathered around the meeting table, there was  only one person in Serenity’s world, and when she spoke, her words were  meant only for Endymion.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s been far too long since we last met. I  think it’s long past due that we repair the failing relations between  our peoples. I fear that by maintaining segregation, we have only  created mistrust.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion leaned his frame across the table.  “Much agreed, Princess. Earthlings, I fear, do not understand the Moon  Kingdom’s good intent, and despite our continued attempts to keep the  peace, my people have much to worry about these days. Between the  ecological disasters we have been experiencing-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess frowned. “What kind of ecological disasters?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince’s brow furrowed, and he turned to Beryl. “Was that not in the report we sent before our arrival?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps it accidentally got left out.” The red haired woman shrugged casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion  returned his attention to Serenity. “Of late, the Earth has been  experiencing minor tectonic activity, a decrease in rain, increasing  temperatures, and severe electrical storms that have caused widespread  failures of our technologies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Prince Endymion,” Mercury spoke  tentatively. She glanced to her Princess and leader who nodded for her  to continue, and despite the hard glare she felt from the Earthling  female, she continued. “ Most of those problems you described may be  related to an increase in sunspot activity I’ve been tracking lately.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sunspots?” The Prince asked. He was too preoccupied to notice the shittenou shifting uneasily in their seats.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If you like, I can run some models based off my data. I’m sure it would prove most beneficial.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion bowed slightly to the Mercurian. “We would be most thankful for-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Our  scientists are already hard at work on this issue.” Beryl barked. “Your  assistance-“ The Prince’s scolding glare seemed to silence the woman,  and the tactician backpedaled. “-may be of <em>some</em> use, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus  nodded sagely, though her eyes were trained on Beryl. “You may be onto  something, Mercury. Hopefully any joint effort made by the Moon and  Earth to work together will be viewed as an advantageous effort to all  of our peoples.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I hope it will be so,” Endymion sighed, “but  between these disasters and the discovery of those hideous monsters  that have been found at our pole, I’m afraid the Earthlings seek to  make the Moon Kingdom their scapegoat. It may not be a logical  conclusion, but my people are frightened. You must understand.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity’s cobalt eyes softened. Her hands reached across the table to close around his warmly. “I do understand, Endymion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beryl  pushed herself away from the table’s edge. Leaning back in her chair,  she crossed her legs. “What information can you share with us about  these monsters you call <em>youma</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The very name seemed to make the Princess of the Moon cringe. Endymion sat straight and pulled away from Serenity. Beryl smiled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus  rested her elbows on the table’s edge and leaned forward. Her measured  words had been carefully rehearsed. “We know that they have infiltrated  the planets of our solar system as far as Neptune.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what? They simply mill around the pole of these planets like they do on ours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ fist connected with the table loudly. “They attack and kill each planets’ inhabitants mercilessly!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’  reprimanding glare silenced her subordinate, but she laid a steadying  hand on Mars’ thigh under the privacy of the table’s edge.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We also know that before they slaughter their victims, they suck the life-energy from their bodies.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Life-energy?” One of Beryl’s finely shaped eyebrows arched.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.” Venus chose to ignore the sarcasm.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what do they do with that <em>life-energy</em>?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We…  don’t know… but we do know that they are not intelligent creatures, yet  they have the means by which to teleport between planets via access  points of unknown origin.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then you are implying that these  creatures are being controlled by a third party.” It was a statement,  not a question. Beryl’s cold eyes dared Venus to make a presumption.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I am <em>implying</em> that the youma could not make such moves on their own.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion  clenched a fist. “None of this explains why they are on Earth, though.  And if they’re attacking the populations of the other planets, why has  ours escaped their carnage?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Kunzite, seated immediately to his Prince’s right, growled. “Would you prefer that to be the case, my Prince?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No! No. Of course not.” Endymion sighed. “There are too many questions, and we are torn in so many different directions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then  let us help you.” Venus stood, her fingers splayed on the tabletop, her  long, golden hair falling over a shoulder. “We can work on this  together. Allow the senshi access to your planet, and we’ll scout it  out ourselves-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Absolutely not,” Beryl’s fist hit the table,  “that would violate our treaty. Considering their current distrust of  the Moon Kingdom, our people wouldn’t take too kindly to that, would  they, Prince?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion’s hopeful smile faltered. “Ah, no. But… perhaps we could-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps we should take a break.” The human tactician stood, and leveled her gaze on Venus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The leader of the senshi narrowed her cerulean eyes. “Thirty minutes should be sufficient.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  figures around the table stood, chairs squeaked against the marble  floor, conversations in several languages and dialects filled the room.  Beryl leaned across the table, closer to Venus.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Trust me, that’ll be <em>more</em> than sufficient. I don’t want to be here any longer than you <em>want</em> me here, little girl.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“What a <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">bitch</span></em>.” Minako growled, pacing around the courtyard’s center.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus Minako, I <em>heard</em> that language.” Serenity scolded from the opposite side of her  courtyard where she lounged next to Ami and Makoto, blissfully stuffing  her mouth with cookies as though she weren’t in the middle of such  stressful negotiations.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Damn it.” The Venusian grumbled, albeit  much, much quieter. She needed a distraction. She glanced at Rei. A  seductive smile tugged at her lips. No. That would have to wait for  later. For now, she’d have to resort to her <em>other</em> favorite pastime that involved that woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  headed towards the brooding warrior. With her back facing Minako, her  legs were swung over the balcony’s edge and her chin rested in her palm  as she gazed towards the garden below. The Martian seemed  unapproachable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei? Are you in there?” Minako asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Those  amethyst eyes blinked and the Martian looked over her shoulder. She  smiled slightly when Minako slung an arm around her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t think too hard, you might break something.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  let the barb roll off her. She wouldn’t fall victim to the Venusian’s  avoidance – she wanted to talk about this as much as Minako did. There  was just something about that human tactician, something that rubbed  Rei the wrong way, as though she’d seen her somewhere before. Usually,  her senses would have given her a clearer reason for her uneasiness,  but she’d been through so much over the past several weeks that all her  experiences blended together to create a cloudy haze out of her senses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s Beryl.” The Martian finally said haltingly. “I don’t trust her any farther than I can throw her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako snorted. “I don’t know, I bet you’ve got a pretty mean throw, I mean, what with you being a barbarian and all.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei groaned and rolled her eyes dramatically. “Three weeks ago called. They want their joke back.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Burn.” Minako chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Really, Beryl is the one running the show.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  could tell.” Minako said offhandedly. Their skill at shifting from  serious conversation to witty banter and back again was becoming  impeccable. “She was speaking for the entire planet, completely  railroading Endymion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It was more than that. I think it’s less so with the Prince for some reason, but the shittenou seem to hang on her every word.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  picked up on that too, which is strange because when we first met them  three years ago, the shittenou were blindly devoted to Endymion.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what of Beryl back then?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako shrugged uneasily. “She wasn’t with them. We hadn’t even heard of her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Doesn’t that seem a bit odd?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“A bit. But you know what’s worse? She’s in love with Endymion, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei turned to catch Minako’s gaze. “Eh!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh yeah. She’s got it bad. The emotion is so strong it borders on desperation. It hurts just to be <em>near</em> her.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Endymion? What of his feelings?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian rolled her eyes. “Please. Even <em>you</em> must have noticed. He couldn’t keep his eyes off Serenity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei sighed. “And she couldn’t keep her eyes off him, either.“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is going to get ugly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Not as ugly as you.” Rei said with a satisfied chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako sucked her teeth. “Low blow!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei smiled appreciatively. “I prefer to call it payback.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Venus drew herself to her full height. “Your decision?”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Endymion  fidgeted in his seat. He did not meet the leader of the senshi’s eyes.  “We would permit Princess Serenity to travel to Earth. There, we could  conduct more talks on our territory to raise morale amongst our  peoples. It would be the first step to repairing our interplanetary  relationship before any further steps are taken.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus snorted.  “That’s unacceptable. We cannot delay research of the youma that are on  your planet. Let us all come. Between the senshi and the shittenou, if  we work together and combine our resources, we should be able to  infiltrate the pole and assess the youma threat more effectively, all <em>while</em> repairing the relationship between our kingdoms. We could accomplish two feats at once.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian’s glare hardened. “Besides, I will <em>not</em> permit my Princess to travel to your planet unattended.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince of the Earth steepled his fingers together. Uncertain eyes met Beryl’s and the tactician stood.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“In  that case, she may bring one of you as her aide. I fear that the  presence of all the senshi will raise too many questions amongst our  people. We can’t risk further mistrust. And that is our final decision.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And what of the youma?” Venus barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We will send our own <em>researchers</em> to the pole. The shittenou have graciously agreed to meet this threat  head on.” Beryl replied with a cool smirk, and then met the leader of  the senshi with a coy smile. “Is this acceptable?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Venus’ gloved hand balled into a fist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a sad look towards the Prince who was avoiding her imploring gaze, it was Serenity who answered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It will have to be so.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
She  heard the knock and ceased her restless pacing. The Earthlings should  have left by now, but blue eyes widened hopefully. “Yes?” Serenity  called.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury cracked open the door to the Princess’ courtyard,  uncertainty evident in her cobalt eyes. “Princess… Prince Endymion  requests an audience.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Underneath her white gown, Serenity’s feet  hastened double time to the door. She knew her guardian was taking a  great chance. “Ami-chan, please let him in.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Mercurian  worried her bottom lip. Serenity’s hands clasped in front of her eager  form. With a slight sigh, the senshi of wisdom stepped aside and opened  the door for the human visitor. Endymion hastened forward into the  opening.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have five minutes.” Mercury said sternly before shutting the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess of the Moon launched herself into Endymion’s waiting arms. The Prince of the Earth held the woman close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry we can’t see each other as much as we’d like, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But I’ll see you in just a week, right?” Serenity’s voice was a whispered exhale.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Much  to Serenity’s displeasure, Endymion stepped back, but in his absence,  he pressed a small, plastic device into the woman’s palm. Her blue eyes  widened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This will make our separation more bearable. All the  men in my army use these to keep in touch with their girlfriends back  home.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then does that mean…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Smiling handsomely, Endymion  captured Serenity’s trembling lips with his own, but only briefly. He  parted quickly. “I’m sorry, my love, but it’ll raise suspicion if I’m  not aboard the transport shuttle soon.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Princess reluctantly  released her Prince. Blinking back tears, she nodded bravely. “I’ll see  you soon, Endymion. In a matter of days.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Prince saluted his Princess sharply. His cape swished about as he turned and headed for the door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Endymion, wait!” Serenity’s voice bordered on desperation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark  eyes looked back over his shoulder to see the Princess running towards  him. He opened his arms just in time to catch her. Her lips tasted like  tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I wish you hadn’t done that.” He sighed quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Endymion?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You break my resolve.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Tears spilled from shut eyes as Endymion kissed Serenity deeply.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  Sea of Serenity sparkled with a golden glow. It made Rei think of the  woman she knew approached, even if she couldn’t see her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  neared the Priestess’ favorite spot and came to a halt on the other  side of the giant tree’s trunk, resting her back against it and gazing  back towards the Palace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“One week.” She said darkly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Until the Princess is to head to Earth?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was too much going on all at once, and Minako felt no small amount of  irritation that it kept getting in the way of other things she wanted  to pursue. Her thoughts ranged from such conflicting topics as the  youma invasion, to the threat of the Earth, to the woman she’d become  so desperately addicted to.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Given the time and place, her  Venusian nature won this struggle. She turned her body around the tree  and for a second, was nearly blinded by the brightness of the sun  glinting off the sea that the Martian seemed so entranced by. She  nudged Rei with a toe. Amethyst eyes slowly turned to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Catch me.” She said sharply. It was almost an order.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But before the Martian’s face could even register a look of confusion, the Venusian was off and running in a giggling sprint.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  grinned and spun her weight on a hand. She launched herself to her feet  and gave chase, following the golden streak of hair as Minako dashed  through small crowds of Lunarians and bolted right down the back  entrance of the palace proper.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She chased the woman through the  small town that surrounded the palace of the Moon, realizing that she  was being lured into the plain that lay outside the city’s reach.  Golden, waist height grasses swayed in a gentle breeze, and small,  scraggly little-leafed trees dotted the flat plains.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  either Minako was tiring under the exertion, or the woman simply wanted  to be caught. Rei knew it to be the latter when her arms wrapped around  the Venusian’s waist and the two women tumbled to the ground in raucous  laughter, flattening the tall grasses beneath their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  run had been a long one, and they lay on their backs in a bed of long,  golden grass. Finally catching their labored breaths, they laced their  fingers together loosely as they gazed at the myriad stars seen through  the Moon’s thin atmosphere, despite the light of the Sun.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Thin  sheens of sweat finally dried and the chill brought on by a gentle  breeze caused Minako to shiver. The Priestess turned and unclasped her  cloak, and with her free hand, she threw the makeshift blanket over  both their bodies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was better than any bed, for both the barbarian and the Princess.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There  was no ‘night’ on the near side of the moon; as their celestial body  was locked in synchronous orbit with the Earth, they always received  the combined light of the Sun and Earth. Still, their internal clocks  told them that it was well past midnight. Minako yawned and rolled to  her side, wrapping an arm and a leg around Rei, the second time she’d  found herself in such a position.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, the heavy blue orb of the Earth caught their attention and the two women stared at it in helpless wonder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It looks like it could crush us.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian’s desolate whisper made the Martian’s heart ache, but she was  every bit the realist and could not sugar coat the situation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“They may be our enemies in due time.” She admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The silence became too heavy to bear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What are we getting ourselves into, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian met the Venusian’s gaze. She knew she wasn’t talking about the Earth anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  arm reluctantly left Minako’s waist. Her hand made up for the loss by  cupping the golden warrior’s cheek and drawing the Venusian into a  gentle kiss. Slowly, she knew she’d achieved her goal when she felt the  frown on the other woman’s lips become a tentative smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, Minako relaxed into Rei’s embrace and even if only for a short time, allowed all her fears and worries to be erased.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Gasp  – political intrigue? Definitely not my forte, but the dialogue in this  chapter was a lot of fun to write. Beryl’s quite the antagonist, and  she and Minako are like fire and ice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview: Chapter 9: Like You and Me</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preparing for landing, a long range shuttle flew low over the Lunar plain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Its  two occupants gazed down at a makeshift sparring arena where two  figures – a golden warrior and a crimson warrior – circled each other.  Their closely choreographed movements could have been preemptive of a  sparring session or a dance. At their altitude, it was hard to  determine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ara, Minako and the new one too?” A petite, aqua haired woman asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A tall woman with short, sandy hair snorted. “Just like Ami and Makoto.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just like you and me you mean?“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think its coincidence, Michiru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The aqua haired woman smiled. “No more so than you and I.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  white noise of the shuttle almost drowned the tall woman’s quietly  spoken words. “These girls don’t need men or families to compete with  their duty to the Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Saa.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And no one is better suited to understanding the hardships of being a senshi than <em>another</em> senshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re being incredibly deep today.” Michiru said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I?” The other woman rested her chin in her hand thoughtfully. “Seeing Serenity must bring it out of me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Maa.”  The more introspective of the two wasn’t the only one apt to retreating  into her own world at times. She’d have to remind her partner of this  fact when she was in a more receptive mood. The slightest touch of her  hand on the other woman’s knee snapped the blonde back to her attention.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Haruka?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hn?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take it easy on them. Especially the little Venusian.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ll try.” A coy smirk tugged at Haruka’s lips. “But they need to be toughened up. Her especially.”</span></p>
