----------------------------------------------------------------------

Serenity straightened her dress, anticipation shaking her small frame.  
Finally, another ball had come, and all of her Senshi friends would be 
there.  Best of all, Endymion had promised to come.  Serenity left her 
room and ran into her mother.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
 
The queen shook her head.  &quot;Probably nothing.  Sunspot activity is 
increasing, that&#39;s all.  We&#39;ve been hearing rumors about dissatisfaction 
on Earth, but we don&#39;t think that anything is actually wrong.&quot;
 
Young Serenity rained an eyebrow.  &quot;That&#39;s not really why you&#39;re 
worried.  Two nights ago the planets stirred in their sleep and you 
think that the Senshi took their stones again.  You fear that they are 
too powerful and that the end is coming.&quot;
 
The queen sighed.  &quot;I&#39;ll ask them when they arrive tonight.  Just be 
careful, okay?  Stay close to your Senshi, because they will protect 
you.&quot;
 
Serenity nodded as she watched her mother leave.  Something was coming.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna sighed as she returned Hotaru to her planet.  She had to be at 
the party, but she didn&#39;t want little Hotaru there.  She knew something 
bad was going to happen.  Holding her Garnet Rod in her hands, Setsuna 
remembered Helios&#39;s final words.  &quot;There is no end that does not lead to 
a new beginning,&quot; she whispered to herself.  &quot;Remember that and never 
lose hope.&quot;  Taking a deep breath, Sailor Pluto changed into a formal 
gown of black silk covered in red flowers on dark green vines and 
brushed her hair, placing her intricate crown on her head.  She was 
ready.  Placing her Time Key in its stand before the Gate of Time where 
it could watch time for her and be ready the instant she transformed and 
called for it, Setsuna wrapped her fingers around her henshin stick and 
teleported to the Moon.  She would enjoy herself, no matter what was 
coming.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Queen Serenity greeted all of her guests, smiling as queens she hadn&#39;t 
seen in years and little princesses she hadn&#39;t seen since her daughter 
was born came to the biggest ball on the Moon since she assumed the 
throne.  They were all resplendent in the colors of their planets, 
sparkling crowns or slender golden circlets and tiaras on every head, 
and Serenity felt tears in her eyes at the beautiful sight of so many 
royals dancing so beautifully in her ballroom.  She was waiting for one 
specific guest, and she leaned on the railing of the balcony overlooking 
the ballroom, patient. 
 
Serenity laughed to herself as Hino Kazan bowed to Kaiou Shousha and 
began to dance with her, while the two youngest Kino sons took the young 
Aino twins onto the floor.  The twin girls had never been to a huge 
party before, and they were enjoying themselves immensely.  Fujiiro was 
elegant in a dress of light purple trimmed in her family&#39;s gold, and 
Giniro wore silver trimmed in gold, while Eiki and Saiki both wore dark 
green trimmed in white, as were their tall boots.  They were all 
enjoying the dance, though the Kino boys had to carry the Aino girls or 
risk hurting their backs.
 
In another area, Hakuchou and Kaichou met Momoiro and Ken&#39;nin, both of 
whom were very glad to finally meet other royals.  Momoiro wore the pink 
of her name, while Ken&#39;nin had foregone the common forest green for a 
paler shade trimmed in sunlight gold with tall white boots.  The twin 
boy wore a sharp dark blue suit covered in white wave designs and black 
boots, the image of his father.  His twin sister had chosen a paler blue 
for her dress and white shoes, wearing a delicate golden bird bracelet 
around one wrist.  Smiling, Ken&#39;nin led Hakuchou onto the floor, the 
tiny princess smiling at the tall prince as he lifted her in his arms 
for the first dance.  She was older than the two Aino girls, but there 
was no difference in their manners and actions.  Momoiro grinned when 
Kaichou bowed gracefully to her, his arm held out to lead her onto the 
floor.  Later she would move on to older, more eligible bachelors, but 
the Princess of Kasei was willing to dance with Suisei&#39;s young prince.
 
A murmur spread through the room when Ami entered the dance floor on 
Makoto&#39;s arm, both wearing exquisite jeweled dresses and their princess 
crowns.  As expected, the Senshi outshone the other royals in the room, 
even their own parents.  Ami&#39;s dress started deep sapphire along the low 
neckline and faded to pale ice blue along the hem, tiny gems forming 
flowers along its length.  Her necklace was a gold chain carrying a 
flawless sapphire, but it was not the stone given to her as Crown 
Princess of Suisei.  Her father caught her arm, but Ami shook her head; 
she could not explain its absence to her father.  Makoto&#39;s dress was 
white covered in emerald vines and delicate pink roses, gems sparkling 
in the gentle light.  She, too, wore a simple stone on a golden chain, 
but the flawless round emerald bore no symbol.  Pausing his dance with 
Hakuchou, Ken&#39;nin caught his brothers&#39; attention and nodded at their 
only sister.  They knew where the stone of Mokusei had gone.  The pair 
made their way up to greet the queen, pausing when they sensed another 
pair of Senshi enter.
 
Rei wore a dress of pure crimson silk, beautiful and delicate symbols 
covering her dress, rubies and amethysts fighting for supremacy on the 
fabric, rubies sparkling from the tiara on her head.  She knew she was 
gorgeous, and she was content to let everyone stare.  A beautiful round 
ruby sparkled from her breast, but it lacked the symbol of Kasei.  The 
beauty on her arm grinned as she curtsied to the crowd, her golden dress 
cut almost too low in the front and lacking a back.  Birds drawn with 
white thread and gems of every shade of red, orange, and yellow sparkled 
in the light, keeping the attention of the many young bachelors in the 
room, her sparkling tiara reminding everyone of her rank and power.  
Serenity was quite possibly the only one in the room who noticed the 
gold stone hanging from a golden chain around Minako&#39;s neck.  The symbol 
of Kinsei was nowhere to be found.
 
The four princesses mounted the stairs to the Moon Queen, and Serenity 
smiled.  &quot;I see that the four of you made it.  And you seem to be 
missing a certain piece of jewelry.&quot;
 
&quot;They joined our Star Seeds,&quot; Minako explained, shrugging.  &quot;Rei says 
that something powerful happened between Haruka-san and Michiru-san out 
on Ten&#39;ousei that caused our stones to enter our bodies.  We&#39;re not sure 
what happened.&quot;
 
Rei nodded at her lover&#39;s assessment.  &quot;When they get here tonight we 
will ask them what they did.&quot;
 
&quot;Speaking of Haruka and Michiru,&quot; Makoto laughed, pointing at the door.
 
Haruka and Michiru entered the room.
 
They made such a perfect couple. 
 
Haruka wore a suit of gold, trimmed in the deepest blue, the hem 
sparkling with intermingled topazes and sapphires.  She, alone of the 
young senshi, was Queen, her crown outshining the tiaras her friends 
wore.  That symbol of power caused the princes and young princesses to 
bow slightly as she passed, a gesture she was not comfortable with.  She 
wore no necklace, seeing no need, and Serenity knew for sure that the 
stones of the planets were no longer separate from their Senshi.  
Michiru&#39;s dress was colored in every shade of blue imaginable and 
sparkled with the matching stones, the same stones evident in her crown.  
She did wear a necklace, but it was a small heart-shaped turquoise 
rather than the aquamarine of Neptune.  The pair looked up at the 
balcony and smiled when they saw their partners and the queen, ignoring 
the stares and whispers as they ascended the stairs.  Smiling at their 
friends, the two princesses bowed.
 
&quot;Greetings, Majesty.&quot;
 
&quot;Nice to see you again, Haruka-san.  A lot of things have changed since 
I last saw you.&quot;
 
Haruka smiled and glanced down at her mother-in-law on the floor.  
&quot;Yeah, she figured it out.  My father is perfectly okay with us, though 
he was a little freaked at first.&quot;
 
&quot;Do tell us what happened with our stones.&quot;  Rei, as usual, did not care 
to waste time being tactful.
 
Haruka smiled.  &quot;It was Michiru&#39;s idea.  She thought we should try to 
access all of our power and connect to our planets.  I was able to take 
the stone into myself, somehow, and Michiru, totally against my wishes, 
followed my example.&quot;
 
Michiru playfully batted at Haruka&#39;s hands.  &quot;I didn&#39;t give you a chance 
to object.  Besides, we needed to do this; Setsuna-san told us that we 
must.  And I see that all of you have, too.&quot;
 
Rei grunted and crossed her arms over her chest, purple-gray eyes 
sparking.  &quot;That happened when you two tried to combine your powers.&quot;
 
Serenity gasped, one hand flying to her mouth.  In the back of her mind, 
words form the notes and journals of the former queens crossed her 
minds, and the mention of the time when Uranus and Neptune would try to 
combine their power.  If they succeeded, all of the kingdoms would fall.  
She was about to stay something, but Setsuna walked in at that moment 
and raised a finger, warning the queen to be silent.  At the sight of 
Setsuna, elegant in black and smiling at her, Serenity lost the ability 
to speak.  Memories of her time with the Queen of Meiousei filled her 
thoughts, and she could only watch helplessly as the beauty came closer.  
Serenity moved to the railing again, watching Setsuna approach as the 
six young Senshi returned to the dance floor.  Young Serenity moved onto 
the floor, joined a moment later by a tall man in a black suit, a man 
the queen knew as Prince Endymion.  Smiling, Serenity ignored her 
daughter and returned her attention to the tall woman who joined her on 
the balcony.
 
For a moment, neither woman said a thing as they stood and stared at 
each other.  Setsuna let her fingers touch Serenity&#39;s cheek, and the 
silver-haired woman smiled.  &quot;It&#39;s good to see you again, Setsu-chan.&quot;
 
&quot;And you, my queen.&quot;
 
Serenity took Setsuna&#39;s hand and kissed her palm.  &quot;I told you not to 
call me that.  Here I am not your queen.  We&#39;re much more than that.&quot;
 
&quot;We haven&#39;t been for a very long time,&quot; Setsuna whispered, letting her 
hand come to rest on the queen&#39;s white cheek.  &quot;You have a kingdom to 
run and I have an apocalypse to prevent.&quot;
 
&quot;I think it&#39;s too late, Setsu-chan.  I think that my beautiful kingdom 
is doomed.&quot;  Setsuna wiped the tears off Serenity&#39;s cheek and kissed 
that same cheek gently.
 
&quot;Do not be afraid,&quot; Setsuna whispered, wrapping one arm around 
Serenity&#39;s waist and pulling her just a little bit closer.  &quot;There is no 
end that does not bring a new beginning.  Do not be afraid and never 
lose hope.&quot;
 
&quot;When did you become such an optimist?&quot;
 
&quot;I met a very interesting person on Earth.  He hasn&#39;t been born yet, but 
he sure seems to know a lot about fate and the future.&quot;
 
&quot;Earth?  That place has been the center of so much recently.  I fear 
that it will be the end of us all.&quot;  Serenity looked up at Setsuna, 
smiling.  &quot;But, for right now, let&#39;s ignore all of our problems.  Meiou 
Setsuna, will you dance with me?&quot;
 
Setsuna smiled as she took Serenity&#39;s arm.  &quot;I thought you&#39;d never ask.&quot;  
Together, the queens descended the staircase, walking slowly, eyes 
locked on each other.
 
Haruka chuckled as she spotted the two.  &quot;Would you look at that.  I 
always wondered about those two.  How long do you think it&#39;s been for 
them?&quot;
 
Michiru rested her head on Haruka&#39;s breast as they danced.  &quot;I don&#39;t 
know, but it really doesn&#39;t matter.  They can be happy tonight.&quot;
 
Serenity and Setsuna joined the couples on the floor, swaying in time 
with music and holding each other close.  Serenity looked up and 
whispered something to her partner, and Setsuna smiled.  &quot;Yes, I 
remember,&quot; Setsuna whispered, one hand cupping Serenity&#39;s cheek.  &quot;What 
of it?&quot;
 
The silver-haired queen leaned up and kissed her dancing partner, 
pulling Setsuna closer.  They kissed deeply, swaying slowly to the 
music, and the princesses around them laughed at the sight.  Even the 
most sophisticated of them were prone to random acts of affection in 
public.
 
A moment later, the peaceful dance was shattered as all of the Senshi, 
queen Serenity, and her daughter fell to the floor, clutching their 
heads, the symbols of their respective planets glowing fiercely from 
their foreheads.  &quot;Saturn,&quot; Setsuna gasped, desperately calling for her 
Time Key.  But the pain changed from stabbing agony to a pain in the 
gut, then ceased altogether.  Setsuna sat up as her staff finally 
appeared, and the other two Outer Senshi summoned their talismans.  
Michiru looked in her mirror and gasped, tears streaking her cheeks.
 
&quot;No,&quot; Michiru whispered.  &quot;Moons of Neptune, no.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka, they&#39;re dead.  All of them are dead.&quot;
 
&quot;All of whom?&quot;
 
&quot;Saturn,&quot; Setsuna whispered, falling back, tears in her eyes for the 
first time in years.  &quot;They are all dead.  Even little Hotaru.  
Especially her, since they knew . . . Serenity, they&#39;re gone.&quot;
 
The queen covered her mouth with her hands, rocking back and forth.  
&quot;No,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;It can&#39;t be true.&quot;
 
&quot;Majesty!  We&#39;re under attack!&quot;  Serenity&#39;s two cat advisors, Artemis 
and Luna, dashed into the ballroom, skidding to a stop at the queen&#39;s 
feet.  Serenity, regaining her composure as she stood up, took command.
 
&quot;Everyone, we&#39;re under attack.&quot;
 
Haruka looked at the princesses standing beside her, and they nodded as 
one.  The Senshi all raised their henshin sticks and transformed, 
dashing outside as the other royals hurried to obey the queen&#39;s orders.
 
Princess Serenity and Prince Endymion were nowhere to be found.</pre>
