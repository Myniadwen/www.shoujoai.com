	&quot;Hey, Ami, can I ask you a question?&quot;

	I&#39;m talking with Ami at a coffee shop. I saw her and decided to
say hi. Something made me remember a recurring dream, and I thought I
should maybe ask her. I mean, she is going into medicine. Maybe she&#39;s
read up on her Freud lately. &quot;Sure, what is it?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;ve had this weird dream. I&#39;ve been having it for the last few
weeks. It always starts with me and Usagi in a study session.&quot;

	&quot;Seems kind of out of the ordinary...&quot;

	&quot;Ami!&quot; I say, my voice full of mock anger. &quot;You know, I think
you&#39;re finally developing a sense of humour.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks.&quot; she replies.

	&quot;Anyways, we&#39;re studying, but suddenly she starts looking at me
with this seductive smile on her face...and then we--&quot;

	I trail off. &quot;Interesting...&quot; Ami seems to be tossing the
information around in her mind. &quot;It might be that it&#39;s your true
feelings for her. They&#39;re just surfacing like this. To tell you the
truth, it could very well be anything.&quot;

	&quot;Well, thanks, Ami-chan...&quot;

---

	&quot;Rei, could I ask you a question?&quot;

	Rei had a little bit of a problem with a recipe she was trying
to cook for dinner. It seems she misread the cookbook and set the oven
to 525&ordm; instead of the called-for 325&ordm;. So, naturally, she phoned the
food help line--me. I went over to her temple to help, but that dream
keeps haunting me. I thought maybe Rei might be of some help.&quot;

	&quot;If you&#39;re wondering how I could have misread the cookbook, I
was sure it was 525.&quot;

	&quot;Nono, it&#39;s alright. At least you caught your mistake in time to
be salvaged. I was thinking about a dream I&#39;ve been having for the
last few weeks. Maybe you could help me decipher what it might mean.&quot;

	&quot;Alright. What happens?&quot;

	&quot;I&#39;m in a study session with Usagi. I don&#39;t usually remember the
subject--math or science or something. I don&#39;t know. But Usagi always
starts to smile, really seductively--and it kinda gets hotter from
there.&quot;

	&quot;Well, I&#39;m probably not the best person to answer this, but I&#39;d
say you&#39;ve got a crush on her. You might just be in denial or
something. Why don&#39;t you ask Ami?&quot;

	&quot;Did. She said the same thing.&quot;

	&quot;Oh. If the dream&#39;s really bothering you that much, why don&#39;t
you talk to Usagi about it?&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t know. Probably some fear she&#39;ll be shocked, or worse,
laugh. Nothing substansial.&quot;

---

	&quot;Mina-chan, can I ask you a question?&quot;

	I&#39;m out at the mall with Minako. She decided to invite me since
she hasn&#39;t been in...must be _days_. &quot;You just did.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant. You&#39;re pretty good at matters of the
heart, right?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. You see a boy that _doesn&#39;t_ remind you of your old
boyfriend?&quot;

	&quot;Not exactly. I&#39;ve been having this dream for about a month now.
I&#39;ve already talked to Ami and Rei, and I&#39;m still not sure. It starts
with me and Usagi studying math, I think. It&#39;s not that important.
Anyway, Usagi always gives me this seductive glance--you know the one.
Looks more like it should be a guy looking like that at you--and,
well...&quot;

	&quot;Say no more.&quot; Minako replies. &quot;You know, I had the same kind of
dream over this boy in my class a few years back--only it wasn&#39;t that
hot and heavy, that&#39;s replaced with him asking to marry me--and it
turned out to be I was in love with him. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking
about the dream, and--him. It didn&#39;t work, though. He wasn&#39;t
interested.&quot;

	She looks like she&#39;s about to slip into one of her rare
depressions. &quot;Hey, don&#39;t wory about it. If the creep wasn&#39;t
interested, it must not have meant anything, right?&quot;

	&quot;I guess so.&quot; Minako replies.

---

	This is driving me crazy. I&#39;m completely torn over whether I
should talk to Usagi. The rational part has no problems with talking
it over with Usagi. It&#39;s only a dream, right? But the emotional side
of me is still deathly afraid of rejection. What if she laughs at me?
I can hear it. &quot;Oh, Mako-chan! I&#39;d have never thought it in a million
years!&quot; And neither would I. The rational side is slowly gaining
ground, though. I just have to gather up my confidence.

---

	&quot;Hey, Usagi, can I ask you something?&quot;

	I&#39;m at lunch with Usagi. We&#39;re just talking, but just being with
her is bringing forth memories of the dream. &quot;Sure, Mako-chan, what
is it?&quot;

	&quot;Well, I&#39;ve been having this dream.&quot;

	&quot;A dream? Maybe Ami would be better suited to deal with this.
She knows about that psycologist guy. What was his name? Fraud?&quot;

	&quot;Freud. And I&#39;ve already talked to her. And Rei and Minako, for
that matter. The dream--well, it has you in it.&quot;

	&quot;Really?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. We&#39;re studying...&quot;

	&quot;Me? Study?&quot; She says, a big smile on her face. &quot;Not without
being chained up!&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I kinda figured that. Anyways, the fact we&#39;re studying is
not that important. About 5 minutes in...&quot; I&#39;m incredibly nervous. I
have to get this over with. &quot;Well, you start giving me this look.&quot;

	Usagi&#39;s expression changes. She seems to recognize this. &quot;When
did you start having this dream?&quot;

	&quot;About a month ago.&quot;

	&quot;And does it end up with you...and me...&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. How did you know that?

	&quot;I&#39;ve been having the same dream.&quot;

	&quot;You have? Well, I was wondering if you know what it might
mean.&quot;

	&quot;I think it might be a vague memory of the Silver millenium.
I mean, me and Mamo-chan are still married and everything, but...I
don&#39;t know. I think we might have been lovers.&quot;

	&quot;You know, that kind of makes sense. Wonder why it&#39;s been in our
dreams for the last month.&quot;

	&quot;That I have no clue about. Once, that I can deal with. But for
this long...maybe it&#39;s supposed to be a sign. Maybe we have some
feelings for each other we don&#39;t know about yet.&quot;

	&quot;That&#39;s what I got from it, too.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. You want to trade lunches?&quot;

The end.

Ending notes:
Decided to take a small reference to At the Crack of Mercury here, and
put in that little thing about Usagi only studying if she was &quot;chained
up&quot;. Hey, before you flame me for that, look at my other Lemons. Lots
more ripoffs where that came from (Artemis&#39;s Lover comes to mind real
fast...)
