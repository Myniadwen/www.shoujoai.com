Hi, it&#39;s me again!

I hope you haven&#39;t been to shocked with where Hotaru left you hanging 
last time but I can&#39;t help it. She has something of a dramatic 
streak, probably due to the theater courses she has taken recently. 
*shrugs* Anyway, that really was not our happiest time back then and 
nearly tore us apart. In the end though, we came out stronger than 
before and even more aware of how much we needed each others 
presence. The separation we faced then was hardly the last of 
hardships we had to endure in the future but the event set the course 
for our future.
	Let me not hold of any longer. You deserve to read about the 
conclusion of our adventures in England.

(Minako)
The clouds this morning reflected my mood, dark gray, here and then a 
few drops of rain and a strong wind. Typical weather, even for a 
summer day in England, and what could be better on such a morning 
than a good cup of tea. Though I did not share most English people&#39;s 
distaste about coffee, I had always preferred the standard national 
drink. A good herbal tea was always refreshing, even if my parents 
were a bit startled at my unusual request the morning after my 
memories resurfaced... Such meaningless thoughts drifted through my 
head at this godforsaken early hour of the day as I stared into the 
swirling liquid of mentioned tea, the last line triggering unpleasant 
memories of Hotaru once again. I could barely get my mind off of my 
girlfriend which was probably rather understandable the circumstances 
considered.
	&quot;I take it, you couldn&#39;t sleep.&quot; I raised my head lazily to 
glance at the figure standing in the doorframe of the kitchen. If not 
for the faint aura my Senshi-trained eyes detected, I could have 
sworn she was a complete stranger. Her wings concealed and her hair 
at waist-length, neatly trimmed and ebony black might be able to even 
fool my friends, if they did not know what they were dealing with. I 
sighed and took a sip of my tea and then sat the cup down on the 
table, not able to suppress a minor yawn. &quot;It&#39;s not the same,&quot; I 
simply answered. Over the past week I had become accustomed to having 
Hotaru next to me when I woke up and now, the second time in a row, 
there was nothing but void in the morning. And it hurt. It hurt 
because it always brought back the painful memory of two days ago 
when Hotaru was captured. I became much to aware that everything had 
been real, not just a nightmare. A very nice start to begin the day, 
I tell you...
	I closed my eyes with a sigh. Priapos had slipped behind my 
chair and embraced me from behind. A gesture I welcomed more than 
ever. Especially considered the harsh words traded between us 
yesterday. I was disgusted with myself to let my control slip so 
easily and almost hurting my kin sister out of desperation and pain-
blinded anger.

---Flashback---
&quot;What do you mean, you could not locate them? I thought you know 
where you were staying, so don&#39;t give me this piece of crap!&quot;
	I was in a very bad mood after not sleeping very well, which 
was not all too surprising. Waking up without my sweet Firefly beside 
me as a reminder of the previous day&#39;s events had me on the edge 
already. When Artemis and Priapos came back from a quick sweep 
through the area with nothing but blank results, I snapped. To be 
honest, I think I scared the hell out of the elf who was at the 
moment dangling from one hand around her throat and pressed against 
the wall. Her eyes were pleading but I was too far into rage-
dimension to actually notice.
	&quot;It... It&#39;s because of the cleansing. I can&#39;t use the portals 
anymore because they require negative energy, also I don&#39;t think he 
would be at the base.&quot; I lessened my grip again, as my  
subconsciousness reminded me mildly that I would not like the 
consequences otherwise. &quot;Why?&quot; I hissed impatiently, my eyes blazing 
with inner fire. But before the elf could answer, I picked up a sound 
something between a growl and a snarl, before Artemis snapped at me, 
effectively bringing me out of my state. &quot;Venus, stop that now and 
think!&quot; My partner rarely used such harsh tones with me and I knew 
all too well how upset he was over my unusual behavior. My eyes 
traveled from the elf to him and back to my... kin sister, before I 
finally dropped the girl I had just rescued a day before and now 
nearly killed in a fit of misdirected rage. She was not responsible 
for that and if I would have thought straight, I should have figured 
the meaning behind her words out before she even uttered them. Adonis 
would be dumb to hold Hotaru captive where Priapos even with her ties 
effectively cut could find him. No, I might despise my old kinsman 
but he was not an idiot, far from it.
	Ashamed by my actions I averted my eyes to the ground and 
turned around. Shrugging of Priapos&#39; hand, I walked out of the room.
---End Flashback---

&quot;Gomen nasei, Pria-chan...&quot; I murmured, not really trusting my own 
voice at the moment. The rest of the day had been lived on an 
unspoken agreement not to mention the morning incident anymore and I 
felt too guilty for losing control to try and approach the issue. 
Priapos hushed me with a gentle finger to my lips. &quot;No harsh 
feelings, Hebe. I owe you a lot and you cannot really be blamed for 
yesterday after all, all this was partially my...&quot; She trailed of and 
did not finish but I knew all too well what she wanted to say and I 
also did resist the urge to reassure her that she could be held 
responsible for her actions. Efadio were extremely honorable and a 
shame like that sat deep within my former bodyguard and kin sister, 
it would simply do not any good to argue with her about it.
	&quot;We&#39;ll find her, I promise,&quot; she said instead of finishing 
the previous sentence and I could only grasp that little beacon of 
hope she offered and hold on very, very tightly. I turned around, 
meeting her eyes with mine. An unspoken understanding passed between 
us. &quot;I think we need to talk.&quot; Priapos just nodded. With our tempers 
a bit calmer it was time to learn what exactly we were facing here 
and how it could be possible for Adonis to be here... again.

 (Priapos)
I dreaded this conversation to come because I was not sure how much I 
was able to tell and how much I should tell. The events were blurry 
at best. Whatever yanked at the roots of my suspicions and 
insecurities after Hebe left for the Moon, it certainly made a very 
good work of putting me under it&#39;s spell. Bits and pieces that is 
what I remembered and nothing much in detail about &quot;the grand plan&quot; 
as my now terra-born kin sister phrased it.
	&quot;We came to this time in order to set things right after our 
own present was all but lost,&quot; I told He... Minako - I should really 
get used to this - sincerely to which I earned a lifted 
eyebrow. &quot;Excuse me, are we talking of real time travel here? That is 
a bit farfetched, isn&#39;t it?&quot; I chose wisely not to comment on the own 
leap Serenity had created in their recent battle and just simply 
shrugged my shoulder&#39;s in response. &quot;All I know for certain is that 
one time we were forming plans for a counterstrike against the Moon - 
still under Metallia&#39;s influence then - and the next moment we are 
here, confronted with a future not all too pleasant for our now free -
 so we thought - minds. You can well imagine what that an impact had 
on us.&quot;
	Artemis nodded at this and for a moment I caught some muffled 
words about Pluto not allowing something. I was well aware that there 
probably was a Sailorpluto somewhere but to the common people and 
most likely the whole system with exceptions of the Queen her 
identity was yet a mystery. I decided not to dwell further on the 
subject since it was unlikely that the cat advisor would share such 
information, even with his charge or me.
	Which brought me to think about the other matter of a not so 
much mysterious but highly dangerous Senshi sleeping within my kin 
sister&#39;s mate that we both had solid proof for. What an unlikely 
couple they made and I could not help but blanch at the thought what 
their hidden past memories said to this most... interesting mating. 
It was due to a pledged agreement from both me and H... Minako&#39;s 
partner that we would not voice this bit of information in my kin 
sister&#39;s presence, especially not in her present emotional state. 
Nonetheless the thing proved to be tricky and I had a sinking feeling 
that Adonis detected young Hotaru&#39;s potential and might use it 
against her own mate... A fact making it all the more necessary for 
us to find the hiding place of my former master and investigate 
before any real harm could be done.
	&quot;Be that as it is. We have to find Adonis hiding place 
quickly, or it might have catastrophic results,&quot; Artemis voiced my 
own thoughts to which my kin sister simply nodded, even if not fully 
aware of the whole impact of the situation. &quot;Yeah, I don&#39;t even want 
to know what this bastard does to Raven, especially since I 
effectively laughed off his own prediction.&quot; She laughed bitterly and 
I could see in her eyes that her former kinsman had lost any respect 
left with my sister. I dreaded the day they&#39;d face each other. 
Learning about this other, obviously reincarnated Adonis - or 
Danburite as he called himself back then -, had helped me understand 
Minako&#39;s wonder about my old master&#39;s arrival and the pain associated 
with him.
	&quot;He was not too pleased when I informed him about your mate, 
that&#39;s true. If I had been on my right mind, I would surely have 
expected him turning up at our match...&quot; Minako shot me a look that 
clearly said I should let the &quot;guilt trip&quot; rest and better 
concentrated on the situation at hand. I was pleased to see that my 
kin sister was in a much better mood today, even if slightly subdued 
and with a great deal of self-restrain. I could see very clearly now 
why Venus had been selected as the Senshi&#39;s leader, it was situations 
like this her true qualities shone through.
	&quot;Anyway,&quot; I continued. &quot;Adonis will not be too far of. I can 
still feel a strong unnatural presence in the air and that would not 
be the case, if he left the area. I think we should start looking as 
soon as possible.&quot; Minako took her last sip of that terran liquid 
called tea and stood up. &quot;The first good idea this morning. I call 
Kathryn and then we can split in teams.&quot; There was a burst of 
determination in her aura that made me proud all over again. The 
young princess I knew had not lost her touch through rebirth, if 
anything she was even more stronger - shaped by hardships of life - 
than ever.
	As my kin sister left the kitchen I stole a curious glance at 
Artemis, suddenly finding myself pondering something that the white 
cat had mentioned briefly before. &quot;You are not that much worried 
about Saturn awakening than the demon you think is battling for 
control within her.&quot; It was not a question but one of the last 
remaining Mau residents answered anyway. &quot;I have a vague hope that 
the mating bond between Venus and her proves too much of a binding to 
be a threat. The other presence though. I have no idea what exactly 
it is, only that it certainly is no ordinary Youma or anything 
related to Metallia&#39;s minions. And it is powerful that much I can 
tell. Let us just hope that the pendant protects her until we found 
them.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, let&#39;s hope that,&quot; I replied dully because we surely 
did not need another unknown power playing havoc on our little merry 
group. &quot;Any intention of calling for backup?&quot; I asked the logical 
conclusion to my thoughts. Artemis didn&#39;t answer for a long time, 
looking out at the dark clouds, looming like an impending menace over 
the land. &quot;Believe me,&quot; he said at last. &quot;I am strongly tempted.&quot;

(Hotaru)
---Flashback (about six years ago)---
&quot;Hotaru-chan? Are you alright, we want to go?&quot; I blinked, 
considerably. The first thing I was certain about was that I couldn&#39;t 
remember what exactly happened in the near past and how I ended up 
here... Wherever here was? Probably a dream, which meant I 
was &quot;dreamwalking&quot; again but,,, Wait, did someone call me by my name 
and wasn&#39;t that voice...? My eyes went upwards as my alter ego that I 
was currently co-hosting looked up and if it would be my body to 
command, I sure as hell would have fainted right away. There, framed 
by a gentle face of a middle-aged woman with shoulder-long black 
hair, were the most enchanting violet eyes, eyes that I would... 
could never forget. Frankly the woman was the spitting mirror image 
of myself or maybe I should phrase it the other way round. The woman 
in question was my long dead, oh so beloved mother...
	&quot;Huh? Gomen, Okaasan, I just had the weirdest feeling.&quot; Hey, 
I remembered that! That did happen and I had until now not clearly 
determined what this weird feeling was, but seeing it now, that was 
probably my dream essences - or something like that - merging with 
her. Don&#39;t blame me, the ability didn&#39;t come with a instruction 
booklet. My mother smiled at me warmly. &quot;That&#39;s okay, Hotaru-chan, we 
all have these sometimes.&quot;
	&quot;Knowing her, she probably thinks its prophetic.&quot; I - or 
better my counterpart though I was strongly tempted myself - turned 
an annoyed look in the direction of the voice. There, already halfway 
through the door, stood a dark-brown haired girl around four or five 
at least. Her ruby-purple eyes flashed a little in a silent 
challenge. &quot;And you would know anything about it, Imouto-chan?&quot; My 
sister - a word which sent a shiver down my spine - shook her 
head. &quot;No, but I&#39;m at least not pretending.&quot; My counterpart huffed 
and our mother chuckled. &quot;Now stop that, will you? We promised your 
father we will be there on time, so that we don&#39;t mess up his time 
schedule.&quot;
	Around somewhere I knew then this particular event took 
place, as if I hadn&#39;t had enough pointers already. That was The Day. 
The day when we went to my father&#39;s labs, the day where it happened, 
changing our and especially my life forever. I could not allow that, 
I had to do something, I had to warn Otousan... But nothing of that 
was in the reach of possibility. This was merely a dream, a memory at 
best and I could not influence it, so I could only witness through my 
counterparts eyes as the happy family went out to meeting their 
dreadful fate...
---End Flashback---

&quot;Such dark thoughts for a young thing like you.&quot;
	My head literally snapped up when my awareness was yanked 
back into reality. The first thing I noticed was that I couldn&#39;t move 
either my arms or legs which were outstretched and bounded by an 
unseen yet powerful force. The space surrounding me was dark and 
menacing. The simple feel of the air gave me a chill down my spine 
and the fact that there was nothing that could clearly be seen in the 
overflowing darkness was unsettling to say the least. My mind still 
occupied and shaken from the sudden, painful memory was still trying 
to orient itself as my eyes fell on the tall, lean figure directly in 
sight. The man was handsome beyond question. With long gold-brown 
hair, curled into tiny locks, a smooth face, a muscular body and 
South European skin. His eyes were of a deep dark blue and the sign 
of Venus was resting on his forehead...
	&quot;You,&quot; I snarled, my memory returning in a blinding rush. The 
man, I know had to be Adonis, just smirked and waved a finger 
mockingly. &quot;Now, now... Is that any way to behave around elders?&quot; My 
eyes hardened as I felt the familiar cold feeling rise up inside of 
me. &quot;What do you want with me? If you think, you can lure my mate...&quot; 
All of a sudden Adonis stood directly in front of me, one hand under 
my chin as he held it with a firm grip that began to hurt. &quot;Your 
mate? Do you really think you can qualify for that role even in the 
slightest?&quot; I know fully well from what Minako told me that Adonis 
had a cruel obsession with Venus that went a long time back into the 
Silver Millennium era. Backed by the confidence of Minako&#39;s full 
support and love, I looked at him unfazed. &quot;Hit a nerve, didn&#39;t I?&quot;
	Adonis&#39; face changed into one of anger for a brief moment 
before he let go of me and relaxed, still I think I earned a few 
points here. &quot;Pah, as if a mere terran could truly fill the role at 
the side of the Goddess of Venus.&quot; He slowly turned to walk back to 
where he originally stood. &quot;Never heard anything more funny.&quot; Though 
I could not agree with him, he struck a few nerves with that. Exactly 
that had been a lot of my concerns lately. How could I actually think 
to be Venus&#39; ultimate fulfillment? How could I dare claim the Love 
Goddess as mine? But when I think back on the past several days and 
especially on our initiate mating night, I knew it was true and my 
confidence was well-founded.
	&quot;Anyway,&quot; Adonis said nonchalantly, as if the brief display 
of obsessive jealousy had never transpired. &quot;I think, you will make a 
formidable ally, once your potential is triggered. Lets see what you 
say when you face your own mate in battle.&quot; Instantly an icy fear 
gripped me. Triggering my potential? Did he mean the demon or 
whatever was inside of me? If where was anything I truly feared it 
was this malevolent personality inside of me to take control and 
destroy my new life that I had built with such effort in the previous 
days as it had done so many times before. The thought that I might 
hurt... No, no, never! &quot;I won&#39;t hurt her, never,&quot; I said out loud 
though I knew my voice was shaking.
	Adonis looked at me with a satisfied grin. &quot;Oh really? Just 
like you would never hurt Megumi, right?&quot; Before I could even begin 
to register the shock this statement send through me, he held up a 
hand a bolt of pure black lightning struck me with full force. I 
cried out in pain as the energy crackled and discharged all over my 
body. Scenes were playing before my mind eye, scenes I wanted to 
banish from my conscious but that would almost remain and come 
haunting me. Scenes of a laboratory, a glass globe, my fingers 
touching the globe, a dark sphere forming, a burst of flames... When 
her, consumed in fire, her face horribly distorted but her eyes with 
a scaring clarity flashing brightly, locked directly on me. *It&#39;s all 
your fault! Okaasan and me died because of you!* I pressed my eyes 
shut but the face would not vanish, the pain more emotionally than 
physically, would not stop. And all the while only her words echoing 
through my mind. Your fault! Your fault! Your fault! Ever and ever 
again. I began to sob quietly, to drained to scream, just whispering 
the name. &quot;Megumi... Imoutochan...&quot;
	I did not see Adonis leave the room or the pendant concealed 
under my clothing beginning to glow softly.

(Minako)
Another day had passed and nothing had come out of a constant search 
in which we literally turned every stone in the area of several dozen 
miles. I began to doubt the logic of Priapos that Adonis was probably 
hiding nearby, even if I had to admit it was the most likely of 
possibilities. That just left the question where the heck was he? I 
winced slightly as a wave of despair crashed against my mental 
shields and which painfully reminded me that Hotaru was still out 
there, held hostage by a guy who was obsessive with me and aligned 
with dark forces. There was no telling what he would do to my 
girlfriend but wherever she was and whatever he did, it surely was 
traumatic. The distress and emotionally torment was so strong the 
first few times I received the echo over our bond that I had to block 
the connection on my side, making it one-way so that I still was able 
to pour my love through it. The shields were up constantly but it 
still registered and stung a little which was the proof of the 
intensity of the emotions.
	Kuso, I hate waiting, I thought bitterly. If we would not 
turn up with results soon, I might as well explode with dreaded 
anticipation. I really wondered now, how Usagi had managed to cope as 
she did with Mamoru captured and probably put through hell itself. 
Yes, sure, she was in no better shape than I the first days but 
recovered quickly enough, even with her beloved turning up as the 
enemy. I did not know, if my spirit would be able to survive a 
confrontation with my mate. If Adonis truly managed to turn her, as 
Priapos and Artemis seemed to fear...
	I reacted with the speed and instincts accustomed with a 
Senshi, as I vaulted forward, the energy blade just barely missing 
me, as I catapulted into a spiral and landed elegantly in a defensive 
position. Priapos withdraw her weapon, inches away from penetrating 
the floor and looked at me sternly. &quot;If I wanted to do, this would 
have sliced you in half before you even noticed.&quot; My eyes hardened 
but unfortunately I knew she wasn&#39;t lying. An Efadio would never 
attack all-out from behind against a honorable foe. If she had meant 
to kill me, when she would have surely been able to.
	&quot;What do you want?&quot; I asked cautiously at last. Priapos held 
her weapon lazily, while I had one hand hovering right at the 
entrance of subspace. The elf shook her head and for a minute there I 
thought I was looking at my old teacher and sparring partner, only to 
realize that it wasn&#39;t just an impression. &quot;I know you are distraught 
about the welfare of your mate, sister. But you need to be more 
focused and let your emotions be a tool of strength, instead a 
pitiful excuse for distraction. If you go out there in this state to 
face Adonis, your beloved is already doomed.&quot;
	I arched an eyebrow at that, my confidence and pride rising 
already with her truth-filled taunts. I knew fully well that I was 
far behind the state of training I had in my younger years at court 
with my kin sister. She was a master in combat, physical and 
magically and had outmatched me quickly when she came to be my 
bodyguard and further along my sensei. Most of what my old self knew 
was her doing because she always managed to bring me to new heights. 
This situation brought back memories of a happier time, of a similar 
situation where I used to be equally distracted at times. Priapos had 
always managed to trigger my pride and therefore push me to train 
even harder.
	With a flash, I held the manifested and transformed Venus 
Tear in my hands and answered my kin sisters barely visible amusement 
with a grim grin of my own. (A/N: A grim grin, hehe... :)) &quot;Let&#39;s see 
who is doomed, huh?&quot; Priapos jumped into the air to land a few feet 
at my side and we turned towards each other, weapons raised in an 
unspoken challenge. Without further words we rushed forward...

---Flashback---
Energy lashed out to the sides when my blade collided with that of my 
sensei. The elf was quickly pressing for an advantage and gaining 
good ground at this. But I wouldn&#39;t give up so easily. Pria had 
managed to stir my pride once again after defeating me in our 
training sessions again and again, to a point where it was almost 
humiliating. Remembering all the teachings from my kin sister and 
best friend I emptied my mind and tuned my spirit and soul fully to 
the emotions and feelings from my heart. The inner strength of the 
Senshi of Venus, the child of love was founded in the heart, in the 
unyielding believe and love for other people. I was to protect those 
who felt love, I was to spread love, I was to show love. Nothing 
could hurt me, if my love for mankind and all good creatures in 
existence was unwavering because love was a force to be reckoned.
	Quick and precise like an arrow, sharp and deadly like a 
blade, withstanding and unfaltering like a shield of the strongest 
metal forged, I moved and stood my ground, meeting my opponent blow 
for blow, never letting go of the strong emotions in my heart that 
were my birthright and my fate.
---End Flashback---

The green blade wavered violently when it was caught between two of 
my own ones. I twisted the cross-like weapon and yanked with one 
sharp motion while seemingly slipping on the ground. The movement 
caught Priapos totally off guard and rendered her unarmed in an 
instant. I managed to catch my intended fall and turn it in into a 
backflip.
	We stood facing each other for a few more seconds, catching 
our breaths. I had no idea how long we had fought but from the 
position of the sun, it had to be close to an hour. I had totally 
lost track of time which was partly due to the sudden memory flash. 
Finally I lowered the Venus Tear and put it away again. Priapos 
smiled lopsidedly, though I could tell from her eyes that she was not 
only satisfied but actually proud. &quot;Feeling better?&quot; she asked not 
the slightest bit out of breath.
	I considered the question for a moment before answering 
equally steady: &quot;Much.&quot; It was that I still felt emotionally wrecked 
and torn but once again my kin sister managed to remind me that 
feelings, emotions were my strongest weapon beside my command over 
metal. By not letting the knowledge and sentiment of my beloved pains 
affect and distract me, but instead using this wisdom to further fuel 
my determination to find a rescue my mate, that was the much better 
way to handle the situation.
	Priapos smirked but her features softened quickly. &quot;Its okay 
to hurt alongside your mate, otherwise I doubt your bond would even 
be strong enough but don&#39;t let it interfere with the ultimate goal.&quot; 
I nodded solemnly. &quot;Right.&quot;

(Hotaru)
I had it enough with the dreams already! I had no idea how long I had 
been here, I had not seen my captor in a very long time that felt a 
lot like days at least. And time and time again I would slip into 
unconscious just to be rewarded with yet another memory of my dark 
past. Of the events that shaped me for years. And all the while there 
was the accusing image of my sister, Megumi, her eyes icy and her 
features hardened, just like the very haunting memory she was. As 
much as I knew her words were uttered to bring me far beyond guilt, I 
could not deny how much I was truly effected by her simple statements.
	Megumi and me used to be like fire and ice. Most of the 
sister rivalry at the tender age of eight was a charade though and 
deep down we really cared for each other. Both of us were unusually 
developed for our age. This was not so much due to growing up with a 
professor as a father or an athletic expert as our mother but both us 
shared a highly awareness of our surroundings and how to react to 
circumstances which deepened the inherited talents from our parents. 
Where Megumi was more the athletic type, coming quite nicely after 
our mother, I had always pursued to further heightened my natural 
intellect. Megumi was always a bit jealous of me because I often used 
to play the part of the wise, older sister.
	What did freak her out at times was my tendency to fall into 
sudden trances and talk about visions and the like. I mean come on, a 
eight year-old who talks about occult stuff, what would you think? 
Megumi often teased me as a bit weird but never paid it much mind. 
What aggravated her more was that our mother often took a great deal 
of care and patience to listen to me when I &quot;acted weird&quot;. I think 
she never really understood why mother spend so much time with me 
when it was her who tried to carry on her talents.
	Despite the fact that we were two rather premature sisters, 
we were a rather happy family with a steady - if not even wealthy - 
income thanks to my father. Until The Day. I can&#39;t really recall much 
about the whole event other than bits and pieces and from those I 
truly didn&#39;t know, if they were only pictures my mind formed from the 
nightmares. All I knew was that I woke up later in my father&#39;s bed 
and discovered that I was hurting all over. I had never experienced 
so much pain before and then my father told me that mother and Megumi 
were dead, caught in the explosion of his labs that we just barely 
and by some miracle escaped mostly unharmed... Let&#39;s just say that 
was about the last straw to my sanity as everything I knew and took 
for granted crumbled around me.
	In this period of deep and long depression came the 
nightmares, further fueled with the sudden attacks on my health that 
I would know for nearly six years until now as a constant reminder. 
And with them came the visions of Megumi. My little sister like the 
very incarnation of a vengeance demon, loathing and accusing me of 
being responsible for her and my mother&#39;s death. Me, she said, it had 
been me attracting what caused the resulting explosion. It had all 
been my fault. I did not have the power to fight the visions back 
then, retreating further and further into my own misery, my 
occasional of sociality destroyed by the picture the people I dealt 
with had formed about me.
	Now though, ever since I had met Minako, I thought I finally 
got a grip on my life. I thought I had managed to put the haunting 
nightmares behind me and live again. I had somehow earned myself a 
girlfriend I often felt I never deserved, I had made friends with her 
friends and I had finally felt and let happiness in my dark, useless 
seeming life. But now, caught in the grip of an obsessive &quot;bad guy&quot; I 
had to go through all this again, experience the heartache and 
despair of years of a dull and haunted existence again.
	&quot;Iie,&quot; I whispered as I struggled against yet another vision, 
another painful memory. &quot;Onegai...&quot; It was of no use and as I felt my 
conscious slip away, the only comfortable feeling was the calming 
presence of the pendant against my chest.

---Flashback---
I all but wanted to slam the door behind me in a volcanic-range 
anger. Instead I simply closed it without any sound at all and slowly 
walked over to my bed there I sat down and promptly buried my head 
into the soft covers. Silent tears began to flow freely. Tears I 
didn&#39;t want anyone to see or anyone to know about. Especially not the 
cold-hearted Kaori. This school day was the worst in a long time. A 
witch, they called me. Again. For probably the nth-time now. Normally 
that didn&#39;t concern me but today I had lost my best friend, the only 
one whoever bothered to stand up for me and remain at my side no 
matter what. Keika-chan, the sweet child of an artist friend of my 
passed mother. We had gotten along good since sandbox age... How 
could I possible hurt her, either physically or emotional?
	But I had did, didn&#39;t I? And I never ever remembered it. 
Yesterday at school was just the usual blur in my mind after 
experiencing once again one of my attacks that threatened me since 
the accident in father&#39;s lab. And then I had gone and healed her with 
my abnormal powers that everyone else despised so much. I would never 
forget the look in her eyes, the look of outright fear that Keiko had 
never shown around me as long as I remembered. It was, as if she was 
suddenly aware of what a freak I truly was.
	Yeah, a freak, a weak, unhealthy, inhuman witch of a freak. I 
hated myself. What was that for an existence? Was there any purpose 
for me anyway? How could I just drive away the only friend I ever 
had? That was more of a proof that what they said was right after 
all. All the names, the imputations, they were all correct. I was 
nothing but a freak with freaky powers, powers that hurt the people 
around me more than help them.
	*And kill them you mean?* I did not even care hearing the 
familiar, haunting voice of Megumi in my head, probably relishing in 
the sweetness of my misery. I didn&#39;t care because I simply did not 
have the power anymore to fight back. What for anyway? I had nothing 
to defend than myself and I was hardly worthy the attention. *That is 
totally right, Oneechan. You are not worthy of anything. Not worthy 
of happiness because you hurt them all. Hurt them like you hurt 
Okaasan and me, ne?* Megumi&#39;s voice was spitting and venomous and I 
felt my head beginning to hurt with another physical and psychical 
breakdown.
	&quot;Onegai,&quot; I whispered lacking strength to only mouth more 
than actually say it. *You don&#39;t deserve happiness and you don&#39;t 
deserve death either because it would be to light of an excuse.* My 
pillow by now was totally soaked and I gripped my head 
tightly. &quot;Onegai, stop...&quot; But the haunting voice of my sister did 
not stop. *Why should I? You never gave anything about what I said, 
what I wanted. It was always all about you. Mom loved you, she adored 
you, thought that you were gifted and what do you repay her with, hm? 
WHAT?*
	I had my eyes tightly shut as the pain intensified and 
through the swirling of lights dancing in front of me, I saw the 
flashes coming repeatedly, again and again. The laboratory active and 
my father warning me not to lean to close to the experiments 
concealed under the glass globes, my hand reaching out with curious 
fingers, a dark sphere forming, a far distant whisper in my head. 
Then the flames and the horrifying vision of seeing my mother and 
sister consumed by flames, all the while their voices mingling, 
chanting: *What have you done now? You caused this? It&#39;s all your 
fault that we are dead! Your fault! Your fault! You fault!*
	*WAKE UP!* The force of the voice bore a commanding tone that 
it could have belonged to Kami-sama himself and it vaulted at once 
out of the state that I had lost myself while reliving my memory. I 
did not at once react and I wondered why nothing colossal happened 
right away. But then I felt a sudden wave of pure love engulfing my 
spirit through the bond shared with my mate. A picture of Minako 
appeared before my mind eye, radiantly smiling and that all for me. 
All at once, I let my mind relax and cherish the feeling of being 
loved and cared for. What was I doing so blindly losing myself in the 
memory of a life I would more than like to forget. I had my happiness 
now and nobody would or could take it from me. Not Megumi, not 
Adonis, not anyone! A burst of confidence flowed through me and I 
focused my spirit on the source of the commanding voice, determined 
to follow its command.
	With a flash I found myself in a strange place. A strange 
place because I hadn&#39;t been here in over half a decade. My mother&#39;s 
old room. Everything was as it used to be. The comforting glow of 
lamps and a couple of candles, the posters on the walls and the 
trophies of the achievements on the shelves. But what took me 
completely off guard and threatened to give me a heart attack was the 
woman sitting relaxed in the old armchair. Her features not aged and 
the dark hair as similar to mine as I remembered. &quot;Okaasan...&quot;
	I stared disbelieving at the figure who resembled my mother 
so much, my heart was pounding so fast I thought it would burst every 
moment. The features, everything, it was all perfect and yet, yet I 
could not believe what I was seeing, it could not possibly be. How 
could it be? I thought... I froze in mid-thought as my mother&#39;s 
gentle eyes rested on me and there was something wet running down my 
cheek. Tears. &quot;Little Hime-chan,&quot; the person who looked like my 
mother said softly and I thought my hear would surely burst. That 
feeling, that comforting voice, it could only mean... mean...
	&quot;Okaasan!&quot; I rushed forward to throw myself at my mother and 
she readily engulfed me in her arms. We stayed that way for a few 
moments of eternity but yet so utterly short, before my mother gently 
but firmly held me at arms length. &quot;My child, I am so proud of you.&quot; 
Proud? &quot;Demo...&quot; She hushed me with a finger to my lips. &quot;Do not say 
anything. I know already. You should not doubt yourself, you have a 
very strong spirit and the confidence of your mate fuels you greatly. 
You alone have the strength to fight your darker side. It is in you, 
the potential has always been there.&quot; She took the pendant I had 
nearly forgotten in one hand and I gasped in surprise when I saw it 
glowing in a dim silver with a stronger violet outline. &quot;This is 
merely an anchor and can only work as long as there still is belief 
in you. And belief you must, for your whole life lies before you. A 
life worthy of a princess...&quot;
	At this point I felt my protest rising, the haunting vision 
from before springing to my mind. &quot;But Megumi said...&quot; My mother 
shook her head. &quot;Nonsense. The only thing you hear is your 
subconscious, your self-doubt that plagued your mind from the moment 
you realized that you alone survived. This has been fueled over the 
years by the demon inside of you, gnawing on this dark emotions. You 
think you are unworthy for this world, you think that it somehow was 
your fault, you want to believe that there wasn&#39;t anything to live 
for. But is it now? Do you still believe that? Isn&#39;t there at least 
one thing you want to live for?&quot; Her voice was stern and in this sort 
of lecturing tone she often used with me when she wanted to rebuke me 
about something.  Suddenly I had Minako&#39;s smiling face before me 
again and then her expression when I was taken by Adonis... &quot;Mina-
chan...&quot;
	My mother smiled softly and touched my cheek, wiping a few 
tears away. &quot;Do you want her to get hurt?&quot; Hurt? Mina-chan? I? I 
shook my head violently, the thought too appealing to even 
form. &quot;Then live, Hotaru-chan, because that is what she wants you to 
do. Don&#39;t give into darkness and the temptation of death. Never do 
this or you&#39;ll lose her.&quot; Lose... Minako... &quot;Iie,&quot; I whispered barely 
audible. &quot;Then believe in your mate, be strong for her and make her 
proud. Nobody can control you, if you don&#39;t want to...&quot; My 
surroundings began to blur and the image of my mother faltered. I 
reached out desperately but my hand passed right through the 
image. &quot;Okaasan!&quot; Mother smiled sadly. &quot;Believe, Hime-chan, believe 
and save... your sister...&quot; I gasped, trying fruitlessly to hold 
control over the dream. &quot;Nande? What do you mean? Megumi is...&quot; It 
was too late.

(From the diary of Aino Minako)
Maybe this will be the last time I&#39;m writing in this thing. I have no 
idea what will happen tomorrow but I feel the need to make this maybe 
last entry. To make matters short, after two more long days we 
finally found Adonis&#39; hideout. The time passed like a blur but at the 
same time it could have also been an eternity. By now I am torn 
between totally shielding myself from the echoes of my bond to Hotaru 
or totally opening to give her my full support against whatever 
torment she has to endure. Either option would probably bring me on 
the verge of insanity and it is only due to Priapos that I aren&#39;t 
already rendered useless. There has been a shift in the bond today, 
something strong and peaceful that has not been there and that let me 
hope. Hotaru had reached out to me and for a brief moment I could 
actually see that she trusted me, that she was waiting for me. That 
helps enormously to relax, I tell you.
	When we were not out in the area searching, Priapos and I 
have been training nonstop as we used to do in the old times. That 
has not only sharpened my reflexes and instincts to a level where I 
can feel the wind currents and every movement within but also my 
skill has improved. Priapos put me literally through hell these days. 
The fruits are worth it though. While my first training session had 
been pure instinct backed up by Hebe&#39;s memory, by now I don&#39;t really 
need the memory anymore. In the past I have always considered 
Artemis&#39; training hard but compared to Priapos&#39; teachings every small 
child could probably please my partner. No, that are two whole 
different worlds.
	My kin sister is a hard but patient teacher and if it will 
ever comes to the point where I fight with the others again, they can 
surely benefit from this. The others, yes. That has been another 
issue that Artemis and I discussed for a LONG time. I am not really 
sure why but I strongly insisted that nobody is to learn about this. 
That decision was merely benefit to Usagi&#39;s wish for peace and a 
simple life. I valued that high, however, I also feel like this is 
something that I have to do on my own. It is my problem, my 
girlfriend and mate and my personal feud with Adonis. I know the 
others would not hesitate to help out and I wish I had the courage to 
tell them. But... I cannot do this.
	Even though all this was like a row of coincidences or maybe 
even fate, I have gotten myself into this mess, I have lost Hotaru to 
the enemy through my lack of resolve and my inability to protect her. 
When Endymion had been kidnapped, we had all been present but nobody 
was able to do anything. In a way we had all failed that&#39;s why we 
felt responsible as much as Usagi. With Hotaru, however, it had been 
completely in my power to protect her. I didn&#39;t though and that&#39;s 
what gives me the most powerful of self-doubts.
	Apart from that I had been active solo for almost two years 
than I first became Sailor V. I am used to work alone with only 
Artemis and a few background resources at my disposal. I know I could 
pull this off, I only have to believe as much as I did when rescuing 
Priapos. Yeah, sounds easier than it is, right? And to say the truth 
I feel confident but not to the point where I am not weary and 
cautious. That has brought me into this situation. A certain amount 
of fear is good because it helps to stay on the ground and see 
clearly. The path is a small one but I am willing to follow it. No, I 
MUST follow it.
	The rare times where we weren&#39;t sparing Priapos and I used to 
rekindle. I was telling her about my life here on Earth, the life of 
Aino Minako, about our battle with the Dark Kingdom, our final 
sacrifice, Usagi&#39;s wish; I told her about Hiroshi and the others and 
how much Hotaru in a few days has managed to change everything. She 
listened patiently and I am glad about it. Priapos began to regard 
and respect me as the human being I am now. Aino Minako, with the 
spirit of Princess Hebe but a completely new life. 
	In turn the elf, I had come to think of as much a sister as 
Hebe does, helped me to remember a lot more from our shared past, my 
early childhood as Princess Hebe. I remembered the first time we met, 
the time when we were playing in the flourishing flora and fauna of 
our mother star. We were happy back then, innocent and without much 
care in the world. Even the training sessions, the formal and battle 
practice for my destined mission was viewed from the eyes of innocent 
children. It was all like a big game for us, the future of 
responsibility so far, far away... And the day had come so quick and 
merciless where we were forced into sudden adulthood at an age so 
young and tender it was hard to believe. We suddenly had to face the 
harsh reality of the world or better the universe around us. It was 
time for a parting and it had literally tore us apart.
	So, yesterday I found myself mulling over this, alone at a 
late hour barely able to sleep...

The wind had worn down over the day and the sky was a bit clearer, up 
to a point where you could see the Moon lurking through the clouds 
and some stars twinkling. All in all a rather peaceful evening and a 
reminder of the time Hotaru and I used to sit out here late and watch 
the stars. How I wished she were here, how I wished that was finally 
over or better never even happened to begin with. &quot;Are you looking up 
at the Moon now, too,&quot; I thought out loud, my mind briefly drifting 
back home to Tokyo, my friends there that not even remembered me or 
the time we shared. &quot;I miss you... Minna-san.&quot; Yes, I did, however, 
my decision stood, I could not bring them into this. As things were, 
I doubted that it was long anyway before the time came for us to 
stand together again for the sake of the world. This though, this was 
my mess, my battle. I had to prove it to me and especially to Hotaru 
that I could pull this of. That had nothing to do with foolish 
bravery, I simply felt obligated to do so. Besides, it would take to 
long to explain everything and we didn&#39;t have this time. First 
informing and convincing Luna, then awakening the others. Explaining 
everything and getting them here. No, that battle would be over in a 
few days, one way or another.
	&quot;I&#39;m sure they do.&quot; I snapped out of my trance, embarrassed 
that I let my guard down so easily that I hadn&#39;t even heard Priapos 
approach. With all the training she shoved onto me, my instincts 
should have covered that. The elf - slipped out of her disguise since 
she was more comfortable that way - sat down beside me. &quot;It&#39;s 
alright, Minako. Even a warrior needs to relax or they start to see 
danger around every corner.&quot; I sighed gratefully and looked up at the 
sky again. We were silent for a very long time.
	&quot;Did I make the right choice? It could be so easy but yet...&quot; 
I trailed of but my kin sister caught on quickly. &quot;It could also be 
too late.&quot; Priapos was silent for a moment. &quot;We all make sacrifices 
one way or another. Whatever you choose, you end up risking someone&#39;s 
happiness anyway. I know the choice is hardly fair and I wouldn&#39;t 
have blamed you, if you decided to awaken the others for that. I&#39;m 
sure they would have understand. Then again, you were always kind of 
stubborn when it came down to settling personal affairs... I mean... 
Hebe was.&quot; I giggled at the memory of this, remembering something 
from my past life on cue. &quot;You mean like I went out all alone into 
the underground tunnels to rescue my favorite doll that went down 
there?&quot; Priapos stiffened a laugh. &quot;Something like that.&quot;
	The event was quite ridiculous. We were both still very 
young, six or seven maybe, I didn&#39;t quite remember. I wasn&#39;t really 
into those things like dolls and everything but the particular one 
had been a gift from my kin sister and it accidentally went down into 
what could be compared to our local sewers. Not so stinky and unclean 
due to the high magical influence on Venus but there were a lot of 
tales spun from the adults about this tunnels. Tales about ruthless 
monsters and the sort. I had went down anyway with Priapos following 
like a dutiful bodyguard, even though I told her all the time I could 
and would do this alone. We ended up running from the huge shadow of 
a monster, that turned out as nothing more than a very quick spider 
that chased us down the tunnels... But we found the doll in the end.
	Priapos and I smiled at the memory and just kept sitting 
there for a while before I felt my kin sister&#39;s hand rest on my 
shoulder. &quot;We&#39;ll find her... I promise.&quot; I caught the slight 
hesitation in her eyes and the twinkle of sadness in her 
voice. &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Pria? You&#39;re not blaming yourself again, are 
you?&quot; As loyal as she was, sometimes the elf was going a bit 
overboard with it. That behavior was no different to what she used to 
be like in the old days, only a bit more reserved now. I had told her 
time and time again that she wasn&#39;t responsible for Hotaru&#39;s 
captivity but as good as I know her she was probably still blaming 
herself for so blindly following Adonis and whoever stood behind his 
plans. I was certain where was someone behind it because the guy was 
never that smart!
	&quot;No, not really,&quot; my kin sister replied finally, heaving a 
sigh. &quot;I just wish I would know more. All I know is that I shouldn&#39;t 
even be in this time, we never should have come here but... I don&#39;t 
even remember why or how we came here.&quot; I could make out confusion 
mingled with the need to understand. I realized that it must be awful 
to not now what has happened to you. I tried to imagine what it would 
have been like then a ten-year old Hebe had woken up in our time one 
day... Scary. Hebe in me shuddered, I think.
	&quot;Understandable,&quot; I said out loud. &quot;I think we both would 
really like to know what caused this, huh? I mean come on time 
travel. I&#39;m sure Adonis couldn&#39;t have pulled this off alone.&quot; The elf 
laughed. &quot;Not likely. I don&#39;t know really, I never was so high up to 
get any clues, just followed orders. Oh, I feel so stupid.&quot;
	&quot;Ask Endymion about it, when you ever get to meet him again,&quot; 
I replied and Priapos was silent, mulling this one other. Then, as if 
suddenly having made up her might she grinned. &quot;I&#39;m an idiot for 
playing depressed here, right? After all I should be here to cheer 
you up, not the other way around.&quot; You are doing it already, I smiled 
to myself silently. Out loud I answered her grin with one of my 
own. &quot;Yup, definitely making a baka out of yourself.&quot; Priapos hmphed 
but laughed anyway...

I have to thank her for that really. If it wasn&#39;t for Pria, I would 
have gone crazy already. She manages to pull me out of my misery no 
matter what. Really amazing actually but I should not complain. Hebe 
and I are not that different apart from growing up in different 
societies with different rules and traditions. That probably is why 
we aren&#39;t so different because both of us never gave much of a 
thought about style, behavior or such things. Who cared what the 
society dictated? Hebe just wanted to live and enjoy that life and so 
do I. Therefore Priapos doesn&#39;t have such a hard time adjusting.
	As I said before, we found the hideout. It is pretty silly 
actually. You know, there is an old military base here in the area. 
Kathryn had explained that it was mostly unused but every now and 
then either police or military would practice there. We had discarded 
the place on mutual agreement at first, thinking that Adonis would 
never choose such an obvious place. And that&#39;s probably what he had 
hoped for. We got the hint about the reports of strange activities 
around the base from Kathryn who urged us to look into that matter 
since there was absolutely nothing scheduled for months. Well, we 
went and surprise! Youma running over the place and dark energy 
everywhere. We never managed to spot Adonis or Hotaru for that matter 
but what we saw was enough for Priapos, Artemis and me. A diversion 
was one thing but for a diversion the energy level was much too high.
	Gah, really, we have been running around our target the whole 
time and never even seen the obvious. For the gist of it, I can&#39;t get 
the feeling out of my system that something had deliberately led us 
on. Be it as it is. Tomorrow we are going to raid this place full of 
Youma and the Kami-knows-what. But Adonis is there and with him 
Hotaru, that is a given. I had felt a strong pull from our bond while 
we were hiding and observing. I am going to get Hotaru out of there 
and if it is the last thing I do.

Hopefully until next time, dear diary.

Your

Minako

(Hotaru)
The silence around me had been eerie and unnerving for most of the 
time, so had been the impenetrable darkness. There was nothing I 
could see or hear with the exception of my own breathing and the 
voices in my head. Megumi&#39;s voice and those of other people I only 
vaguely know. However, they were gone now. The voices were gone and 
the only thing that remained was me, me and the protective glow of 
the pendant. I had my eyes closed because it really didn&#39;t make any 
difference. There wasn&#39;t Megumi&#39;s face like before, where weren&#39;t 
anymore dreams threatening my heart. Nothing could or would get 
through to me, only my mate, for who I waited with new confidence and 
calm.
	Footsteps. Someone was coming. I opened my eyes and relaxed 
my trance to the point where I could perceive my surroundings again. 
The darkness was giving way to a figure that stepped into the room 
and without looking, I knew who it was. &quot;So you decided to stop by 
after all.&quot; With a wave of his hand Adonis lightened a few torches 
and I had to resist the urge to squint against the sudden light. The 
tall man&#39;s eyes focused on mine and I saw the glimmer of surprise 
there. &quot;And you are still resisting. Incredible.&quot;
	He stepped closer to let his hands glide over my body. Do not 
show fear, nor disgust. He cannot hurt you. Repeating the mantra in 
my head, I refused to shudder, even as his hands reached my face and 
he tipped with one finger against my forehead. I lifted my eyes to 
meet his and smiled grimly. &quot;I believe.&quot; Adonis raised one 
eyebrow. &quot;In my MATE,&quot; I clarified, emphasizing the word with as much 
force as I was able to. Dark energy crackled around his fingertip in 
response and I continued smiling with indifference. He was no threat 
to me. &quot;I might have to be more persistent then.&quot;
	Cold electricity danced across my skin, scraping it but not 
yet released. Before anything could happen though, there was a sudden 
flash and the power discharged, burning its caster. Adonis flinched 
and stepped back. &quot;What was that?&quot; I felt my pendant glowing brightly 
and I was pretty sure he could see it now too. As if to confirm that 
theory, Adonis suddenly lunged forward and pulled the silver artifact 
out of its concealment. For a moment the Venusian man just stared at 
the object in his hands before his eyes narrowed dangerously. &quot;I see.&quot;
	*This is merely an anchor and can only work as long as there 
still is belief in you.* Adonis hands began to glow as he attempted 
to yank the pendant right from my neck but I held true to my mother&#39;s 
words and focused all my spiritual power I had collected over the 
last hours since the dream encounter into the pendant. I focused my 
belief and my love for Minako and secured the so fragile looking 
strings holding the pendant around my neck with it. Adonis recoiled, 
as if a lightning bolt had struck him. I smiled. Arigato, Okaasan.
	Not much people knew. I think I am probably the only person 
alive who knew about mother&#39;s abilities and her secret profusion, the 
skill she had perfected over the years. Most people didn&#39;t believe in 
such things as magic, supernatural phenomena or such. But I did, even 
more now after what I have experienced since meeting Minako. And I 
knew mother did too because she was a mage. A not very strong in 
matters of force but an extremely gifted one. She showed me a lot of 
things and the reason why mother always spent time with me and 
reminded me to never ignore my visions, was because she knew I was 
gifted too. Gifted in a way, she said, she didn&#39;t understand. I 
didn&#39;t really believe it back then, I was a child despite my high-
tuned senses after all. And after the incident, how could I believe 
then? If anything, I thought, the only thing I was gifted in, was to 
hurt the people I loved. Not anymore. I understood now, as long as I 
thought that I was indeed the cause of their pain, as long as I 
didn&#39;t believe in the good of my own heart, it would never end.
	&quot;You cannot control me. Nobody can control me,&quot; I said calmly 
the pendant glowing brightly in response. Adonis cursed. &quot;Damn you, 
if you don&#39;t want to give in lightly, when I...&quot; A crash and a 
distant explosion interrupted his outburst and my captor whirled 
around. &quot;What...&quot; Another explosion, this time a bit closer. I felt 
along the line of our bond and was pleased to find my suspicion 
confirmed. &quot;Seems to me, as if my belief holds true after all.&quot;
	Adonis turned his head in my direction, with an annoyed snarl 
in his face. &quot;We will see.&quot; And with a flash he was gone. I was alone 
again but that was alright, because Minako was close. I would just 
have to hold out a little longer and Adonis would probably be to 
occupied to bother me again. Not that he could harm me anyway. 
However... I hoped Minako would be alright, I prayed for her safety 
and wished I could do something more to aid her beside believing. I 
hated to be always the weak one, once in my life I wanted to actively 
help the person I loved.
	*What would you be willing to give for it?* I hesitated. This 
voice wasn&#39;t of the ominous, dark presence that spooked around my 
head for six years now. No, that was purer, more familiar and yet 
strange. I felt it before, even before the incident. This cold, yet 
calming presence that gave me strength when I needed it the most. 
*Everything.*
	*Then prove me that.* And with that my eyes fell shut and my 
body relaxed, as I began to fight a battle of my own, a battle that 
only I could fight and only I could win. A battle against myself.

(Minako)
&quot;Alright. This is it.&quot;
	Artemis, Kathryn, Priapos and I were crouched down right 
outside the military base. Youma could be seen walking around and 
guarding the area. Apparently to the common eye this place would 
still seem to be empty. I could tell because Kathryn had to strain 
herself to even see the creatures that did not exist in normal people 
beliefs. And even I could see the faint glimmer of something around 
the base preventing the true source of the &quot;odd activity&quot; to be 
discovered.
	I looked to my left and right, casting last questioning 
glances at my comrades and received determined nods. I was a bit 
reluctant to let Kathryn join this battle but she had felt 
responsible also for Hotaru and I was sure that I could not hold her 
back anyway. It was time then. Time that we brought this struggle to 
a conclusion and Hotaru back home.
	&quot;Matte, Mina-chan.&quot; I turned to Artemis and saw him 
performing a backflip which produced a small pen with a five-pointed 
star on top and the symbol of Venus in the middle. My partner looked 
up at me with a grim expression. &quot;Take this. You are ready for the 
next stage, more than ready.&quot; I picked up the new transformation and 
studied it determined for a moment. Words sprang to my mind and I 
didn&#39;t hesitate to call them out. &quot;VENUS STAR POWER, MAKE UP!&quot;
	A moment later I launched myself straight over the electric 
fence, right beside me was Artemis while my kin sister cleared the 
way for Kathryn with a quick slash. As expected the moment we passed 
the invisible area every creature out in the open was upon us in a 
flash. &quot;CRESCENT BEAM SHOWER!&quot; With a barrage of beams I cleared a 
path for Priapos and Kathryn who was equipped with a strange laser-
like weapon - I did not even want to know where that came from - at 
my sides. With a flash the extended Venus Tear was in my hands and we 
rushed forward.
	The onslaught of monsters was restless and we had to fight 
for every inch but when we finally reached the inside of the quite 
huge base, the true challenge was yet to began. Youma were falling 
left and right and more came. Most of them were weak but it would not 
be long until we encountered the stronger ones. And yet we did not 
falter in our advance, pushing forward slowly but steadily. The time 
of waiting, the time of hesitation had long passed, none of us would 
surrender or retreat.
	I could only marvel at the strength and the devotion of my 
kin sister and my dear friend Kathryn. Even though it was not truly 
their fight, both would stand with me no matter what. Kathryn was not 
like us, yet she fought the best she could, never giving reason for 
us to slow down. For her Hotaru had become a good friend, someone she 
could communicate with without the fear of taking her away from me as 
with Allen. The police officer, knew that she couldn&#39;t do much but 
was willing to give what she could. Without her efforts and resources 
we might not even have been here and searched around the base for a 
long time, too long.
	I did not even have to think about why Priapos fought with 
me. As long as I could remember my kin sister had been at my side, in 
my childhood on Venus, even while I was with the other Senshi on the 
Moon I always felt her presence right beside me, aiding me, giving me 
strength. When she was controlled by the enemy it had pained me. 
Pained not only Hebe but also Minako. And now, now she was devoted to 
the person I had become. Minako, Hebe, Venus... Priapos cared about 
all of the aspects, she had come to understand and wanted to do 
everything to undo the pain she had unintentionally caused her kin 
sister.
	&quot;VENUS WINK-CHAIN SWORD!&quot; The Venus Tear flared brightly and 
a golden blade shot forward from its tip tearing through a swarm of 
lesser Youma. I had found out that the mythical stone was to some 
degree as much a focus as the Ginzuishou was a weapon. It all 
depended on the heart and the will of the wielder. Magic cast through 
the Venus Tear was considerably stronger and with lesser strain to 
the magical reserves. However, the longer I used the crystal, the 
more intense my heart and feelings were strained, so I had to be 
careful.
	I looked around and saw that we were still surrounded by a 
good dozen of Youma and we hadn&#39;t even left the outer circle. On this 
rate we would fall before I could reach Hotaru. Priapos was slashing 
through a Youma just now, while Kathryn held a group with accurate 
shots of her laser at bay. I decided it was time for some roundhouse 
action, if we ever were to proceed. Shrugging of my current opponent 
I jumped up straight into the air, lifting the Venus Tear which 
reshaped by my will. Priapos immediately recognized one of my 
verified attacks that we had been practicing and shoved Kathryn to 
the ground. &quot;GOLDEN RING CIRCLE!&quot; The crystal in my hand glowed a 
bright gold and expanded into a ring of pure energy slicing through 
the remaining Youma. The attack was not that spectacular as it 
seemed, just a variation of the Love-me Chain fueled by the Venus 
Tear&#39;s power.
	I landed back on the ground and took a few moments to catch 
my breath. Energy flooded into me and I felt Priapos&#39; hand on my 
shoulder. &quot;Arigato,&quot; I breathed, then straightened up and looked over 
to Kathryn who was already flushed from the strain. &quot;Stay here and 
secure this area.&quot; Priapos formed a second blade of magic and tossed 
it into Kathryn&#39;s hands who was a little surprised by that. &quot;These 
weapons are wielded by the strength of the heart. Wish for it and it 
will answer you.&quot; I shot a questioning look at my older friend who 
looked down at the blade in her shaking hands but nodded nonetheless.
	Priapos and I turned around without a further word and 
together with Artemis continued into the labyrinth of corridors in 
search of my abducted mate.

(Hotaru)
My vision cleared slowly and there was an odd feeling in my heart. 
Somewhat... empty. No, not really empty, more like alone, single. 
Panicked I reached out to test my connection with Minako and was 
relieved to find it intact. Still, there was something different and 
strange, something unfamiliar that I just couldn&#39;t figure out. The 
incredible thing was that I felt relieved as well as troubled by the 
absence of... it?
	Deciding to let the feeling go for the moment, I looked 
around and noted that my surroundings were by all means unfamiliar, 
yet something told me I had been here, a long, long time ago. A vast 
desert lay before me. Most of it was dust or not even sold, like some 
kind of mist that rose from the ground to make the atmosphere thick 
and blur one&#39;s vision. There was no sun visible to the eye and 
neither was the Moon. There were moons alright. Yes, MOONS, some of 
the satellites appeared not to be bigger than small points in the sky 
from my position but I was absolutely sure these were moons.
	Titan, Rhea, Sinope... I counted them off in my head and 
stopped in mid-thought. Nani? I am on Saturn? But how...? I trailed 
of looking around closely. It made some kind of sense, with the 
planets atmosphere and the various number of moons, never mind that I 
didn&#39;t even knew HOW I identified some of them. I didn&#39;t remember 
hearing anything about mist on Saturn, then again no human really had 
set foot on the planet.
	&quot;Nobody but you.&quot; I whirled around startled at the deep, cold 
voice that was frighteningly familiar and similar to my own. There 
perched on a crumbled stone formation stood a figure clad in a white-
violet fuku, similar to that of Venus&#39; but yet with some striking 
differences. There were for once the long black ribbons from the back 
bow and the eight-pointed, white crystal on her chest, right in the 
middle of the black bow. What sent a shiver down my spine though was 
the gleaming steel of the glaive that the girl held loosely in one 
hand. The murderous object loomed forebodingly over the short Senshi. 
Her face, her hair, the skin and body, however. They were all mine.
	I stared for several moments at the figure, the presence I 
felt was familiar and I began to realize it was the same source of 
power that had risen time and time again to do... something. It 
wasn&#39;t the demon, so much I was sure about. The presence was 
powerful, destructive yes, but not evil. Clearly not evil. And now I 
think I knew why.
	The Senshi looked at me expectantly but patiently. I tried to 
meet her eyes but the deep pools swirling with powers virtually 
shocked me away. The gaze was so intense and yet indifferent, the 
whole experience was purely eerie. &quot;You... I... I know you... You 
are... What have you... done?&quot; The Senshi smiled and instead of 
relieving me, it scared me even more. &quot;Yes, you know me. I have been 
with you since you were born in this world.&quot;
	&quot;With me? But you are...&quot; The Senshi&#39;s smile never left her 
face and the indifferent way about it was truly unsettling. &quot;I am 
Sailorsaturn. The Senshi of Silence, who is the end and the 
beginning, nemesis and marker of a new cycle. You, Tome Hotaru, are 
my rebirth.&quot; Saturn made a swishing gesture with her weapon and her 
tiara flashed brightly, giving way to the glowing sign of Saturn on 
her forehead for a brief moment,
	I gulped, blinking repeatedly in vast astonishment at the 
figure who claimed to be literally me. A part of me, like Hebe was to 
Minako. I was hardly able to comprehend the thought that I, I out of 
all people harbored the reborn spirit of a Senshi. Truly I should be 
surprised, however, somehow I wasn&#39;t. Some part in me had always 
sensed that there was something special inside of me. Something I 
could not quite grasp, well out of my reach.
	&quot;How can it be?&quot; I asked out loud, my voice small and 
cracking. Saturn shifted her weapon and made another motion with it, 
as scenes appeared in the air in front of us. I could make out a 
beautiful palace surrounded by a peaceful, silver ocean. A golden 
Crescent Moon was seated atop the highest tower. &quot;The Moon Palace in 
the era of the Silver Millennium,&quot; Saturn explained in this 
indifferent and chilling voice again. The scene shifted and showed 
familiar shots from a devastating battle, the Senshi fighting 
monsters, Venus among them, the armies of Metallia were slowly 
pressing forward. I wanted to look away when the Senshi died through 
Metallia&#39;s dark power but found myself unable to move. Moments later 
a bright purple flash rushed over the palace, stretching out over the 
whole moon&#39;s surface.
	&quot;The era had come to an end,&quot; Saturn continued, her voice 
more like a background narrator now. &quot;It was my time.&quot; The scene 
shifted to the planet of Saturn and a lone figure ascending out of 
it. In the distance I could see the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto 
glowing in faint colors, thin energy lines connecting with Saturn in 
an irregular pattern. The scene shifted back to the Moon where 
Sailorsaturn touched down on the cool surface, looking around 
stoically but yet with a hint of sadness. She walked over to the 
ruins of the palace and there, leaning on a pillar, lay the dead 
Queen of the Moon. Saturn kneeled down before her and I could 
suddenly hear her voice.
	&quot;I have come for my first, single and only duty to you.&quot; 
There was no response as was expected from a dead person and if I was 
not mistaken I could see a single tear fall to the ground from the 
otherwise expressionless face of the Senshi. *Go with them.* Saturn 
lifted her head surprised. The Crescent Moon on Serenity&#39;s forehead 
glowed softly. *It is time for the Senshi to unite on Earth. The era 
has ended, the next must come, it is the sign.* The Senshi hesitated 
for a brief moment, apparently not sure about the Queen&#39;s 
request. &quot;As you wish,&quot; she finally said and rose again.
	Lifting her weapon to the sky she called out three words 
echoing for a long time over the surface of the planet. &quot;DEATH REBORN 
REVOLUTION!&quot; Ribbons of black and violet emerged from the tip of the 
glowing scythe - the Silence Glaive - and began to consume everything 
in their path.
	&quot;That is, how.&quot; I snapped out of my trance, so caught up in 
the experience that I had almost forgotten about the real Saturn now 
standing atop her resting place. &quot;Fourteen years ago, Tome Hotaru was 
born in this world and with her, as by request of the late Serenity, 
the Senshi of Saturn.&quot; She suddenly hopped forward and landed only a 
few feet from me, I flinched a bit but hold my ground. &quot;However, my 
time has not yet come and when this is over, one way or another, you 
will not remember about our encounter. Yet, you sought my aid in the 
upcoming struggle your... mate has to endure, is that not so?&quot;
	I shivered a little when she pronounced the word &quot;mate&quot; and 
uncertainly wondered what a Senshi of Saturn&#39;s power and standing 
thought about my mate bond with Minako, her fellow Senshi Venus. I 
nodded wearily. Saturn smiled again, this time actually a bit 
warmer. &quot;Your courage and devotion to Venus&#39; reincarnated spirit has 
moved me and stirred my conscious before my time was about to come. 
Frankly I didn&#39;t actually expect things to turn out like they are, 
especially...&quot; She swung the Silence Glaive again and drew a 
flickering thin line of energy in the air, strings of orange-gold and 
violet-purple curling around each other. Without question Minako and 
my bond. &quot;... this.&quot;
	&quot;Ah...&quot; I said and looked up a bit sheepishly, surprised to 
still find the smile there which I could not determine, if it scared 
me more than her usual expression or not. &quot;Yeah, this... you see... 
I... we... I mean, I&#39;m sorry, if I...&quot; Saturn shook her head, cutting 
me off with a nonchalant gesture. &quot;Do not worry about that. What you 
do with your life is your quarrel.&quot; Her smile faded and her face 
turned back to cold, indifferent mask, &quot;However, it became my quarrel 
when you openly requested my help. I heard your wish and will grant 
it... IF you pass the test.&quot;
	Yeah sure, should have known. I could not just for once in my 
life get something for free, right? Oh well, if she meant to test me, 
she should go ahead. My love to Minako was imperturbable. I knew this 
and if she was a part of me for all of my life she knew this too. I 
met her gaze in a silent challenge, letting confidence course through 
me.
	&quot;Very well,&quot; Saturn said and tipped the rear end of her 
weapon against the cool surface, twice.  &quot;Then meet your nemesis.&quot; I 
shivered a little at the choice of words and wondered just what 
Saturn meant by it. A chill ran down my spine and I sensed a familiar 
presence that had been absent ever since I entered the dreamscape of 
Saturn. And now I knew exactly what it was that I had felt missing 
earlier. Neither the presence of Saturn was present, nor that of the 
demon... Then that meant, by personal nemesis Saturn was referring 
to...
	A shadow stepped out of the mists, tall and menacing with a 
defined aura of darkness around it. The features of the... woman 
became slowly visible. She was wearing a long black dress, her upper 
chest bare, leaving very little to the imagination. She had a vast 
amount of jewelry on her body which was tall and radiated a deadly 
beauty. Long ebony-black hair cascaded in wild strands down her back 
and long legs. The eyes were a piercing shade of black with a crimson 
gleam to them, the lips curved into a cruel smile outlined with 
thick, violet lipstick - or was that natural?
	I stepped back uneasily, my eyes never leaving the woman, her 
gaze fixed on me almost mockingly. She looked down as she stood 
before the thin line of Minako and my bond and grinned wickedly. 
Saturn made a short a swift move with her glaive, pointing it 
threateningly at the woman and shaking her head. The demon snarled 
but stepped, awfully close and almost brushing, over the energy line. 
She turned right and walked away from Saturn, positioning herself on 
one end that the bond marked. Saturn gestured for me and I hesitantly 
stepped forward to walk to the other end.
	&quot;I separated our mingled spirits in order to determine the 
fate of Tomoe Hotaru and Mistress 9. Both of you have to prove worthy 
to dominate this body.&quot; Saturn pointed the Silence Glaive at the 
demon called Mistress 9. &quot;I can remove you.&quot; The demoness glared but 
the Senshi ignored it and raised her weapon in striking distance of 
the bond, which made my heart jump a little. &quot;Or I can cut this.&quot; 
Resting the Silence Glaive once again to the ground, she tapped three 
times on the ground. &quot;Begin.&quot;

(Venus)
I turned a corner and immediately went into a tight roll clearing 
away from a swift and surely fatal blow from a HUGE Youma with a head 
like a gorilla and matching arms. Brr... Priapos came rushing in 
behind me and before the Youma could do so much as scream my kin 
sisters energy blade cut his head right off, reducing the creature to 
dust - as usual. We didn&#39;t waste time with comments but took position 
side by side in the thinner hallway, thinner than most of the others. 
A horde of monster came rushing towards us... Too easy.
	Gathering her own magic Priapos let a medium-sized ball of 
mint-green hovering over the palm of her free hand. I did likewise, 
calling upon my own given power. &quot;ROLLING HEART VIBRATION!&quot; A bright 
red heart-shaped blast raced forward and was immediately engulfed and 
mixed by the green one. Another explosion rattled the base to the 
core as the dozen or so Youma were crumbling away from their own 
foolishness.
	&quot;How many of those does he have here? You could almost think, 
he had this planned for weeks!&quot; I shot Priapos a curious look but the 
elf just shrugged her shoulders. &quot;He never told me anything 
important. Just mission instructions... Well, actually it was just 
one mission...&quot; Her gaze dropped briefly but went back to me when I 
touched her gently on the shoulder. &quot;Let&#39;s move on. Can&#39;t be too 
further away now.&quot; It ought to better not be further away now or I&#39;ll 
think I would fall over from exhaustion before I even reached Adonis! 
Priapos jumped up, spun around and nailed another Youma that had 
snuck up on unnoticed with two quick slashes. &quot;Yeah, the sooner, the 
better.&quot;
	With that we continued sprinting towards the inner area where 
we guessed Adonis to be and where the small but steady ripples from 
my bond with Hotaru came from. It was a little hard to follow, 
because it was so... calm... I couldn&#39;t describe it but Hotaru&#39;s 
presence felt a little off, distant, not quite herself and yet still 
her. Didn&#39;t make much sense but at least I knew that there was no 
immediate danger, none I could detect anyway. I really hope you are 
alright, I silently prayed, trying to reach out over our connection, 
reassuring her, letting her know I was coming. I had done it once. 
Right before we entered I had felt an interesting kind of sensation 
float through me. Confidence, inner strength. I bet Hotaru must have 
pretty annoyed Adonis... A thought I could only smile at.
	Yet now, there was nothing, no response at all. Something was 
successfully blocking us. I knew it wasn&#39;t Hotaru, that would be 
different, I was used to that from time to time. But this, this felt 
like a thick mist that could not be penetrated or at least had to be 
worked hard on to do so. I didn&#39;t have the time for deep 
concentration, other than following the thin echo and combat 
awareness. At least Priapos&#39; training had really paid of. I felt more 
agile, stronger and enduring like ever before. And my reflexes were 
razor-sharp too!
	So it came that I reacted with the speed of a super-feline 
when we went around the corner just to find ourselves in the middle 
of another small army of Youma and those seemed somewhat more 
resistant. There was a faintly stronger aura of blackness around 
them. More power, higher positions... And they were still so much! 
Not to mention that they were on us in a flash...
	Must be nearby, that seems to be the honor guard, I thought 
while dodging under one kick, gripping the creepy flesh and without 
remorse - remorse for a Youma, an amusing thought - I twisted the leg 
around, drawing a howl of pain from my attacker. Sensing another 
approach from behind, I vaulted my now helpless victim around by his 
foot and swung him headfirst into its partner in crime. They didn&#39;t 
let me time to effectively cast a spell and I guessed that when I had 
to do anymore area clearing, I would be not able to face Adonis 
anymore. I just knew, I would need a lot of reserves, reserves I had 
vastly strained while working our way through the base. That&#39;s 
actually why I refrained from using the Venus Tear and just cast an 
orange-sparkling energy blade like Priapos used to do.
	Ten seconds of dodging and striking later, we found ourselves 
back to back, catching our breath while our position allowed us a 
short moment to review the situation. Not good. There were at least 
fifteen Youma yet and it was hard enough to take one or two of them 
out in one stride. One stride, that was the best you got in the 
middle of this mess. Priapos parried of a sharp lance-like weapon - 
or better cut right through it - and then a dim, green field 
shimmered into existence. The shield would not hold long but I mused 
that that surely wasn&#39;t the plan.
	&quot;You know, where she is?&quot; I nodded slowly, concentrating 
slightly, trying to find the cord that I had lost in the middle of 
battle heat. There. Very close now. I pointed into the direction I 
faced. &quot;Just a couple of hundred feet maybe. Very close. That ought 
to the last of them.&quot; Priapos nodded and her eyes narrowed as I began 
to realize she was coming up with some sort of ridiculous seppuku 
plan. Priapos was a great military strategist, always having an 
answer to a seemingly hopeless situation. The problem was, most of 
her plans were outright crazy, unhealthy and she was barely able to 
pull them of. She did manage to survive any of her schemes so far, 
though.
	&quot;When I say jump, then jump.&quot; And with that she dropped the 
shield, leaving me no time to think, as she rushed up into the air. 
While I fended of fifteen highly-skilled Youma by myself, I noticed 
with battle-steeled experience and Hebe&#39;s memories that Priapos was 
zigzagging in the air, drawing a pentagram. Zipping one last final 
time around the drawn star, she completed the circle and I had my 
muscles already strained my muscles... &quot;Now!&quot; And before the command 
even fully left her mouth I was airborne, a stunning ring of green 
magic dropped onto the monster mass, paralyzing them effectually for 
some time. I didn&#39;t really need to hear her next command to know what 
was coming. &quot;Go. I&#39;ll handle them.&quot;
	Hesitating just for the briefest of moment, I sought out my 
friend&#39;s eyes, determined, twinkling from excitement. She loved this! 
Deciding that is was no use to argue with her, I turned around 
sharply and sprinted down the corridor. If you could trust anyone to 
handle herself in a crazy fight like this, it probably was Priapos. I 
had more important things to do, much more important things.

(Hotaru)
&quot;Urk...&quot;
	This was ridiculous. Really ridiculous. How was I, little, 
powerless me, supposed to fight a DEMON! I toppled backwards when the 
black bolt struck me once again, this time right into my gut. If this 
had been real, I would surely have lost all the food in my stomach. 
Oh right, there couldn&#39;t be anything left since Adonis&#39; hadn&#39;t feed 
me. But, god, it FELT real! And there was actually blood on the 
ground that I just noticed, my vision blurring from the loss of 
fluids...
	It had gone like that the last few minutes. Mistress 9 was 
playing with me, taunting me and inflicting the most peculiar kinds 
of pain without killing me. She could have snapped my neck by now, I 
was sure of that or she could have evaporated me with one of this 
damn, stinging bolts. That was worse than a high voltage electric 
shock and I felt every discharge still rippling over my body in tiny, 
painful ways. Gah, I wish she would just kill me...
	Damn it, no! I reminded myself sternly of what was at stake 
here. It wasn&#39;t just my life on the line but Minako&#39;s also, at very 
least her happiness. And if that was taken away from her then, THEN 
it would be her life because I don&#39;t think she could stand this agony 
again. Not with Hebe&#39;s fresh memories of Kunzite&#39;s betrayal and death 
at her hands and all the other crushes and losses. An image of 
Saturn&#39;s glaive looming over the sparkling string representing our 
bond flickered through my mind. No, I could not lose this fight. 
Somehow I had to find a way to fight back, somehow I had to find a 
way to stop this... this bitch from taking over my body and...
	Matte! What was that again that Saturn had said to me at the 
beginning of the fight? &quot;Remember, at the moment this IS still your 
body. That is the advantage I must and will grant you.&quot; And somehow I 
knew that, even if she wanted, she could not rip this control from 
me, not as long as I still believed that was my body, my mind, 
spirit, soul and heart. As long as I fought back. Kuso, nobody would 
be taking MY body, not if I had any say in it. I had resisted the 
demon almost six years of my life and was still sane enough to form a 
wonderful relationship with the most beautiful girl - inside and out -
 that had granted me with the incredible gift of returning all this 
love.
	&quot;I&#39;m tired of this, time to end...&quot; Mistress 9 stared down at 
her hand, the motion caught in a glimmering band of violet, the other 
end held tightly between my fingers. Actually I had no idea, how I 
did this but it felt and came so naturally. My previous experience 
with dreamwalking did help here a lot. Although actually influencing 
the spirit realm... I grinned darkly, my eyes flashing with a sense 
of stubbornness I had not felt in the last years since the accident. 
Nobody would kill me, taking my body and make my Minako 
miserable. &quot;This is still my body and I tend to keep it.&quot; I was 
actually effected myself by the chilly tone my voice had taken. It 
almost sounded like Saturn...
	Mistress 9 glowered at me, then her face turned into a mock 
grin. &quot;Oh yeah, with an energy cord?&quot; I smiled secretively, 
sharpening my spirit and my control. With a gesture the cord changed. 
And I mean CHANGED. The demoness squealed in surprise, protest and 
maybe a little feel as a violet-silvery snake wrapped around her 
body. I risked a glance sideward and noticed Saturn with a barely 
noticeable smile and a look of approval in my direction. So far so 
good, now what...
	An inhuman screech echoed over the bare wasteland. The 
penetrating smell of discharge and burnt flesh began to fill the air 
and my eyes widened as Mistress 9&#39;s body seemed to be engulfed in a 
black cloud of lightning bolts. With a loud, roaring thunder the 
cocoon broke and the demoness was left standing fuming, her rage 
building with every passing second. I gulped a little but narrowed my 
eyes and bit back on the fear rising inside of me. This was my mind, 
my spirit. There was no way she could harm me, if I didn&#39;t let her.
	&quot;YOU&#39;LL PAY FOR THIS, LITTLE RUNT!&quot; A powerful, little comet-
sized bolt leaped forward from her outstretched, SHARP fingertips... 
Just to bounce harmlessly of me, as I stood my ground. My eyes were 
not closed but surely distant, as I once again relied on Okaasan&#39;s 
teachings, shutting out all negative emotions, especially pain, and 
focusing on the positive one, especially my love for Minako. Mistress 
9 just growled frustrated and irritated that her technique hadn&#39;t 
work. With critical speed she lunged forward but at the last possible 
moment, I twisted my body and let her pass me. Getting the knack of 
this thing, I fueled my spiritual powers and made a wave motion, 
sending the equivalent in a rushing of almost non-substantial white - 
could be transparent crystal even - into my opponent. Caught of guard 
and just in the process of turning around, the wave struck Mistress 9 
and sent her into a boulder... or better sending her right through 
it! Woah, guess I don&#39;t know my own strength!
	The joy was short-lived when my adversary emerged from the 
debris, just slightly scarred. Her face, however, had now a matching 
grim smile to mine. &quot;So, the little kind has some fighting spirit, 
hm? Well, then it&#39;s time to play rough.&quot; Her lips moved into a 
straight line. &quot;You should have just given up, you know. I can be 
VERY nasty, when I am pushed.&quot; I didn&#39;t back down or let my eyes 
betray my emotions, however, under this icy glare I felt like I was 
wrenched inside out. Not like Saturn&#39;s penetrating cold one, no those 
eyes were piercing. As if they knew all my darkest secrets. Shimata, 
she already knew my darkest secrets, after all she lived six years 
inside of me...
	Well time to change this now. Don&#39;t doubt yourself, don&#39;t 
doubt yourself. You are stronger, you are your own master, you can do 
this! I repeated it over and over again in my head.

(Priapos)
I watched Venus vanish from my sight around the corner and waited for 
a brief moment to let my eyes flicker back to the now growling horde 
of monsters. Now was the question what to do with them. I had 
detected a pattern in the Youma attacks throughout our venture into 
the core of the base. All of them were primarily fixed on Venus. 
There seemed to be some sort of homing device stuck in their minds. 
Most of them had attacked blindly, going straight for my kin sister, 
some usually split up to deal with the distraction possessed by 
myself. It was not different with the sixteen - I counted - beneath 
me. If I let them go now, chances were high that they would simply 
ignore me and I wouldn&#39;t be given a damn thought ever again. This 
though meant that I either had to chase after them and fight my way 
through them to aid Venus or that my kin sister had to deal with them 
after being finished with Adonis and rescuing Hotaru - not that there 
wasn&#39;t a possibility that they crumbled after the defeat of their 
master. Better not to take this chance.
	No, it couldn&#39;t be helped and there was only one way to pull 
this off and seriously relieve Venus from some pressure. Muttering a 
few words in Elvish I easily managed to modify the strings tied to 
the Youma so that I could control them. No, I didn&#39;t control the 
Youma but I could now shift their attention to a target of my choice, 
if I wanted to... Grinning mischievously at the course of action 
beginning to form in my head, I waved my hand in a gesture and set 
the Youma free again as well as modifying their &quot;homing beacon&quot;.
	&quot;Catch me, if you can,&quot; I grinned and shot away at top speed, 
a stampede of monsters close on my tail. I let them close in 
somewhat, then shooting forward again, successfully keeping them in 
eyesight but out of immediate range. Without them noticing I led them 
back through the labyrinth of corridors and although those were much 
more intelligent, they were as much slave to the directing strings, 
which made them follow me blindly, as their kin...monsters.
	Finally I emerged into the hall where Venus, Artemis, Kathryn 
and I had entered. The police officer was still &quot;standing guard&quot;, 
leaning against a construction pile, her laser weapon pointed 
directly in the direction there I came from. She almost fired when I 
came zipping around the corner until she identified me and was just 
about to lower her weapon with a sigh and a scolding look, when my 
pursuers came into sight. This time Kathryn gave a yelp and fired but 
her aim was rather off from the surprise and it barely scratched one 
of the rampaging beasts.
	I fluttered past her with a smug look and an excited smile. I 
didn&#39;t have so much fun since, since... Well, in a long time anyway. 
The thrill from the coordinated hunt was intoxicating and for an 
Efadio there was nothing better than the thrill of a desperate battle 
situation. We were pushed to our limits then and the more we were 
pushed, the stronger we became. That here was merely a comparable 
situation since I had it under a tight control but still it was... 
fun!
	When I reached the outside, I immediately shot up into the 
sky, watching the masses of Youma stumble out after me and looking 
wildly around. I let them look a bit after one saw me up in the sky 
and barked something obviously distasteful. I merely smiled and waved 
my hand once again, chanting softly in my native tongue. There was a 
flash of the green pentagram around the group once more, just for a 
brief moment, then it was done. The Youma hesitated for a moment, 
confused by the target change and the exact nature of this target. 
Finally they started forward simultaneously, going at each other like 
a horde of blood-lusty animals. Body fluids were sprayed, arms and 
legs, inhuman screams echoed through the air. The Youma were 
attacking... each other.
	I grinned triumphantly. Gathering a column of magic in my 
hands, I let the energy gather for a moment before it reached its 
peak. &quot;KISHKAAN MOISTURE!&quot; The gathered ball suddenly exploded 
outward and send several, small &quot;bands&quot; of rippling green wetness 
down, wrapping around the remaining creatures before they could 
continued this albeit the fun factor disgusting display. The moisture 
of the Kishkaan was known on Venus as the strongest acid in the whole 
inner ring system. Needless to say the effect was immediate.
	Softly I tipped down to the ground, several feet away from 
the reminders of the vicious feast the Youma had held between 
themselves... with themselves. I huffed and crossed my arms. &quot;Teaches 
you to never mess with me again.&quot; I looked back and spotted Kathryn 
in the entrance, hovering there stunned an unreadable expression in 
her face. For once she seemed, as if she wanted to throw up anytime 
but then again, she was too shocked to do anything. I gave her a 
lopsided smile and headed back in side waving her after me. &quot;Should 
be the rest of them. Let&#39;s find Minako and Hotaru and see, if we can 
help out.&quot;
	Kathryn grumbled something under her breath but followed. 
Now, I just wished Hebe could have seen this!

(Venus)
The door to the &quot;Admiral&#39;s Office&quot; slid open easily, revealing a 
surprisingly enormous room. Offices usually weren&#39;t that big, not 
even that of high-ranked inhabitants. At least a dozen yards large 
from wall to wall and window to the door. The desk was neatly 
arranged and of dark brown wood with a large monitor resting in the 
middle. The curtains were tightly shut and no daylight fell into the 
room but the unnatural neon glow of the overhead lights were 
illuminating the office deep into the furthest corner. There were no 
signs of natural life here, no plants, flowers or anything else. Not 
that I expected some, it just surprised me that Adonis as a Venusian 
would like to live so... sparse and tidy. I guess, he didn&#39;t have 
time to set something more appropriate up... As if I cared.
	Discarding the thought, I looked around trying to orientate 
myself. Hotaru was here somewhere, I could tell it. But... there was 
nothing that could conceal her from my sight. There was, as I said, 
no sign of life albeit the echo surely had come from this room. So... 
where was she? Maybe some sort of secret passage, a hidden gateway? 
No, there was no feel of negative energy that could indicate a portal 
of sorts. Maybe I could get something from that computer.
	Crossing the room, I slid into the chair behind the desk and 
was relieved to find the screen still active and the system obviously 
in full run. Adonis had always been a bit careless with information. 
With a few keystrokes, I searched my way through the mass of data. 
There were a few, very interesting bits of information catching my 
eye, yet most of them were coded and hard to decipher. Even with all 
the experience I got over the last years, I wasn&#39;t Ami. Still, I 
could say for certain that some files were encrypted in the Lunar 
script.
	What is that about a weird, caped man... Where did he come 
from and did he have something to do with Adonis&#39; appearance here? 
These were clearly records still from the Silver Millennium area and 
some of the names used in cross-references rather often registered in 
my mind as distinctly familiar. Kuso, I wish I could still read this 
properly. I can swear I heard some of this names before. Where the 
heck is Artemis anyway? I had lost sight of somewhere during three 
fights ago. I could really use him now since he was naturally fluid 
in Lunari. Taking out a small crystalline disk, I attached it to the 
terminal and copied the files in a flash.
	When I wanted to detach the disk again, my hand brushed over 
something. A switch? Oh, you are so old-fashioned, Adonis. I flipped 
the switch and promptly a section of the wall to my right slid opened 
and revealed a narrow hallway, dark and without any light. From my 
position I could not tell, if it went straight forward or down. I 
pocketed the disk into subspace and moved forward towards the 
opening. At that moment a slightly out of breath Artemis emerged in 
the door to the outer hallway.
	&quot;*Pant*... There you are. Kuso, Minako, did you have to run 
so fast...?&quot; I paid him not much attention but carefully peered into 
the darkness. Artemis stepped up beside me and looked thoughtfully 
for a moment. &quot;That smells like a trap.&quot; Exactly my thought, still I 
had no chance in this matter. That was the only possibility where I 
could find Hotaru, and finding her I would! &quot;I know.&quot; With that I 
stepped forward, startling a protesting white cat which tailed 
muttering behind me. Chanting in a soft whisper, I created a small 
sphere of light floating in the air before me like a firefly leading 
me to it&#39;s namesake. My senses were sharpened and my hand twitched 
ever so slightly in expectation of an attack.
	However, none came and then we reached the end of the 
straight, narrow corridor, we emerged in a dimly-lit room, a few 
torches burning. My superior night-vision pierced through the 
shadows, making out a surprisingly normal room/office. I had expected 
a dark, wet castle setting of late middle age or something. That 
surprise turned quickly into dismay as my eyes were drawn like a 
magnet to the figure in the middle of the back wall. Her wrists and 
ankles were tied by heavy-looking shackles, her head dropped and her 
body slumped.
	&quot;Hotaru!&quot; I cried out, throwing all thoughts of caution 
overboard as I rushed forward in fear that I might be too late. But 
that couldn&#39;t be since I still felt her presence on the other side of 
our bond. My worries proved to be partially unnecessary since I 
quickly discovered that she just wasn&#39;t conscious... No, in some sort 
of deep trance. There was a faint aura of something around her that 
let me shiver. Her body seemed to be severally weakened, from lack of 
fluids probably, and I could tell there was more physical damage 
underneath the light clothing - still the same as when she was taken -
 that I was aware of. I scowled darkly and run a finger over her 
features, mesmerized by the face I had missed so much. &quot;What has he 
done to you?&quot;
	I jumped back in shock, as Hotaru&#39;s head suddenly snapped up 
and her body was pressed against the wall as she buckled over, as if 
she had been punched in the stomach. And she was spitting 
blood! &quot;Hotaru,&quot; I screamed and tried to hold her steady, shaking 
her. There was no reaction. Closing my eyes I send a cascade of love 
down our bond, lending her some energy. The smaller girl&#39;s condition 
seemed to steady and I received bits and pieces of some sort of inner 
struggle. I could not tell but I knew that it was extremely important 
to Hotaru... The reassurance seemed to help though and I felt her 
confidence rising.
	&quot;My, my, what a lovely picture.&quot; I whirled around, hot-
blazing anger in my eyes at the familiar voice. &quot;You!&quot; My tone 
dropped dangerously low. &quot;What did you do to her?&quot; With a flash the 
Venus Tear lay in my hands glowing brighter with my rising fury. 
Adonis wasn&#39;t impressed and grumbled something before replying 
coyly: &quot;Oh, nothing much. I tried to raise that demon, really. But 
that bitch is pretty stubborn. If I had some more time though...&quot; He 
stopped himself, as the ancient crystal in my hand flared to life in 
a display of four cross-arranged blades. &quot;Adonis,&quot; I growled, 
punctuating my words sharply, &quot;how can you dare taking my mate!&quot; 
There was much of Hebe in the voice and Adonis shrunk back ever so 
slightly.
	&quot;Your mate,&quot; he laughed sarcastically. &quot;Oh, come on, face it, 
Venus. There is no such thing for you - besides me that is of course. 
How long do you think you can keep her, hm? One more week, a month, a 
year maybe? Face the facts, girl, where is no happiness for you 
except your bloody mission. You are a caged animal that declines 
itself the wonders of freedom although it is able to break free by 
own free will. Come join us and we are making everything better than 
it was back then. You and I can be happy.&quot; Adonis indicated towards 
Hotaru. &quot;This one is not suited for you. She is staining your light, 
Venus...&quot;
	Somewhere at this point, I had had enough of his talk. I had 
heard it again and again. Hebe had heard it again and again. However, 
when he began insulting Hotaru that was the final straw to my 
patience. I lifted a hand and shot a warning Crescent Beam narrowly 
missing his head. Outwardly calm I fixed an icy glare on him, holding 
my weapon loosely. &quot;Shows how much you know. When did you ever do 
anything to impress me. You got yourself controlled by Metallia and 
Beryl, you are obviously not better of yet. And still you are 
ridiculously obsessed with me. How about you face it that I will 
never love you.&quot; I indicated at Hotaru myself. &quot;If you would really 
wanted me to be happy, you would see how much I am right now. Priapos 
did see it - which doesn&#39;t surprise me, since she has much more 
brains when you. Anyway, as I said, if you love me, as you said, you 
would finally step aside and let me life my life. A life that I have 
here and that I like. There is never a perfect life but that one 
here, as Aino Minako, this is a good life.&quot; My voice lost its 
indifference, as my eyes blazed once again, my anger formed into a 
sharp hot dagger by now. &quot;And you just committed the greatest crime 
against a Sailorsenshi. You tried to take away her chosen mate!&quot;
	With tremendous speed I rushed forward, swinging my weapon at 
the handsome Venusian. Adonis stepped back, baffled by my fierce 
fury. He recovered quickly and flung a bolt a dark energy at me that 
harmlessly bounced of the blurring blade which&#39;s motion could make 
you dizzy. Striking out once again, I fainted a brutal, frontal slash 
and as expected Adonis drew back and slightly to the side... right 
into the path of a Venus Tear fueled Crescent Beam that hammered him 
backwards against the wall.
	&quot;Oops, gomen,&quot; I taunted, holding my weapon in an uphold 
position. &quot;I thought you could take a little more. But... I shouldn&#39;t 
have bothered. Even without this,&quot; - I gestured at the transformed 
Venus Tear -, &quot;I could beat you easily.&quot; If it wasn&#39;t for the dark 
aura of darkness surrounding and supporting the Venusian I would have 
to fear nothing from him. However, that incalculable element made it 
hard to judge his real strength. I was fairly sure that Adonis was 
unaware of being controlled, maybe not even really caring much.
	&quot;Be careful, Minako. There is an indefinable feel here that I 
can&#39;t quite place,&quot; Artemis murmured softly, his eyes briefly 
switching to Hotaru&#39;s still unconscious form - I really wished I had 
time to at least cut the shackles and put her down. &quot;And it&#39;s not 
from Hotaru.&quot; That got my attention and I watched, shifting my 
balance slightly, as Adonis rose from his position. He chuckled 
darkly. &quot;You Mau people always had this knack, didn&#39;t you?&quot;
	I drew back than I saw the small sphere of... nothingness in 
his hand, glowing eerily and growing brighter. It could really not 
been described as darkness or blackness or anything else in this 
area. There was just a deep abyss of nothing in the air over his 
outstretched palm. Adonis smiled darkly. &quot;We will see who has the 
advantage over who, dear Venus, we will see.&quot; And with that he flung 
the sphere to the ground where it exploded right upon contact, 
expanding at an alarming rate. I had my arms up, instinctively 
shielding myself, as the non-substance passed over us. And then I 
looked up again, we were in some sort of space, not no space... There 
was literally nothing here. Painted black was the only word that 
sprung to my mind. It really was, as if we were standing on a painted 
black background. We could see each other - which was rather 
unsettling due to the fact that there was no light - but other than 
that there was nothing. One thing was for sure that was not Earth 
anymore...
	&quot;Where...?&quot; I gasped out, looking around and spotting Artemis 
to my feet and Hotaru still hanging now practically in midair, 
chained by invisible holds. Adonis smirked. &quot;Nice, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;ve got 
this little present g from our savior. This is a dimension where 
every light is absorbed. I have to admit that I am impressed and 
proud that my suspicious had been right. You really have obtained and 
mastered the legendary Venus Tear. But that will not help you here. 
This dimension even nullifies the power of the Ginzuishou.&quot; He didn&#39;t 
react as I stared at him wide-eyed at the implications, realizing 
that the light from the Tear had dimmed down and was getting weaker 
with every passing moment.
	&quot;I&#39;ll give you one last choice. Join us and we create 
something far greater than the Silver Millennium has ever achieved. 
Otherwise...&quot; I looked back at Hotaru writhing in her trance, 
obviously fighting very hard on her own inward battle. A slight gasp, 
an inaudible scream... My eyes hardened, as I let all this 
impressions, feelings and emotions pour right into my heart, fueling 
it with new essence. The Venus Tear sprung back to life and I smiled 
coyly at Adonis. &quot;Forget it.&quot;

(Hotaru)
Didn&#39;t I already said I had enough of that DAMNED VISIONS! Really, I 
was getting along just fine and actually thought I was gaining an 
upper hand in my fight with the demon when Mistress 9 started to 
attack me psychological again, as if this was real and she was still 
inside my head. Drawing one vision after another from me which were 
awfully distracting. It wasn&#39;t as much as if I could not fend them 
off or that they really effected me anymore. My mind was set on one 
single thing and I was going to tear right through them, if 
necessary. Sure it wasn&#39;t that simple. The trick was to find the core 
of the vision, analyze it and then counter it. Not so hard actually 
but it needed time. The flashes usually only lasted moments, seconds 
as best but in this time I was vulnerable and I had gotten hit a 
critical number of times. Nothing to be really worried about, I could 
manage, if I had to. However, this last psychic attack of hers...
	I found myself in a setting similar to Tokyo. Well, it turned 
out to be Tokyo... about half a decade later. I must have been at 
least twenty and everything around seemed kind of normal, except then 
my wandering steps led me onto the campus of Azabu University. There, 
in the back, hidden behind a couple of trees, Minako was seated. 
Withdrawn, somewhat skinny, haunted... destroyed.
	I approached her, feeling ill at the sight of my girlfriend 
like this although I knew pretty well that this was only an 
illusion. &quot;Minako,&quot; I whispered softly to gain her attention. The now 
pale blond looked up wearily. Tired and old, her eyes held so little 
life. No life at all. I shuddered under the gaze. Shuddered under the 
gaze of a broken, merely adult girl who looked like she had walked 
through hell. And I could just tell she literally had.
	Minako smiled, a smile that lacked any emotion and was 
just... lifeless... speaking of a wish just to die. No confidence. 
Nothing... &quot;You are too late.&quot; I looked at her not 
understanding. &quot;You are five years too late to save me.&quot; And with 
that she looked down again and was silent. I stood there frozen, 
unable to do anything or think clearly. That haunted look, like a 
ghost, a walking, living ghost, unable to pass over. I wanted 
desperately to lung forward and just rip this, this... image to 
shreds but I found myself unable to, glued to the ground. It is just 
an illusion, just a trick of your mind, I reminded myself. Nothing of 
this would ever happen. I would not be the cause of another life 
destroyed. Not Minako&#39;s! It wasn&#39;t true.
	*BUT IT CAN BE, IF YOU DIE TODAY!* Tomoe Keiko&#39;s voice cut 
sharply into my mind, the voice of my late mother once again pulling 
me out of the depths of my misery... Or was it the glowing pendant I 
just now stared down at, finding myself back on the vast surface of 
Saturn. Was my mother&#39;s image just a production of the pendants 
function, some sort of guardian spirit looking like my mother? Be it, 
as it was, again the little thing saved me and brought me back to 
reality. I glanced up to face Mistress 9 once again and froze, 
staring unblinking at the enormous sphere of black energy balance one 
the index finger of her left hand... She was grinning wickedly at me, 
a somewhat crazed expression crossing her features. &quot;Too easy,&quot; she 
said and flung the blast... to the side? But there was Saturn and... 
THE BOND!
	Still stunned from the life-threatening - or was that spirit-
threatening - danger and the swift change in directions of her 
attack, I did not react immediately. Watching the sphere spiraling 
towards the glowing orange-violet band, the picture of Minako from 
that illusion flashed before me. If I lost here now, if I died 
here... Then that WOULD happen. So I had to move! MOVE, HOTARU!
	And I did move. Moments before the sphere made impact, I 
moved, crossing the distance in a blur and reappearing right between 
the energy blast and the band. I was acting on pure instinct, didn&#39;t 
even consider the fact that Saturn would probably not allow one of 
the bargains at hand to be destroyed by the competitors. Logical 
thought had completely left me, just the urge to defend my bond with 
Minako. I could not let this happen. If I did, I would doom Minako&#39;s 
happiness forever, I would be responsible for the destruction of my 
own soul mate&#39;s life. I could die but at least I would die trying. 
Not just standing by and seeing the most precious thing in my life 
being torn away. The most precious thing... The only valuable thing. 
My life had been empty without her and if my existence was justified 
by making her happy, if that was the only thing... even if I would 
get nothing in return... That was worth it.
	I crouched over the glowing bond, trying to shield it with my 
whole body, and drew the probably last sharp breath in my 
existence... And held it... long, VERY long. Nothing happened. I 
expected pain, horrible, destructive pain. Hot fingers scraping my 
body quickly, mercilessly... Nothing. Not even a little stung, 
just... silence.
	I let the breath go, slowly - very, very slowly - and looked 
up to encounter the tip of Saturn&#39;s Silence Glaive just inches away 
from my face. I resisted the urge to draw back startled and just 
stared unblinking. My eyes were drawn to the pendant... lying on the 
ground? Black energy was crackling around the edges and... It had 
taken the blast? It must have been thrown around by the sudden 
movement and then... But, even an artifact like this... Could it 
simply absorb such a powerful attack?
	I looked back up at Saturn and then over to a fuming Mistress 
9. The Senshi of Silence spoke, her tone clear and commanding. &quot;You 
passed.&quot; She made a motion with the Silence Glaive and Mistress 9 
screamed as her body was literally ripped apart. &quot;Be gone.&quot; The 
scream following was chilling to the bone, I tell you that. Then 
silence again, for a long time...
	Until I was startled once again by Saturn&#39;s hand offering my 
help to stand up. My eyes had still been fixed on the spot where the 
demon had been. Saturn smiled softly and her eyes shone with... 
approval. Yes, I think that&#39;s it. She pressed something in my hand, 
it was the pendant. &quot;If you want to win, you have to be ready to lose 
for it. Even though, you knew you could die and would be unable to 
pass the test, you were ready to sacrifice yourself in order to guard 
the very key to your heart.&quot;
	Saturn reached up with one hand and touched my forehead. Our 
eyes locked for a single but endless-seeming moment. Violet on 
violet. Deep poles of wisdom and power meeting somewhat confused but 
confident ones. Eyes that had seen death inflicted by her own hands, 
meeting ones that had seen life in all it&#39;s glory - love. &quot;You have 
proven worthy.&quot; Her tiara vanished and I could see the sign of Saturn 
glowing once again. And there was the feeling of incredible warmth on 
my own forehead, spreading throughout my body. &quot;It is time.&quot; And then 
I... we were gone.

(Venus)
Clang. Should energy even made sound? Somehow it did or was I just 
imagining it. Dark blade against a swirling of four, smaller light 
ones. Strike, block, twisting, evading. You had to give Adonis as 
much, he was a good swordsman. Not as good as me and Priapos, mind 
you, but then there was the factor of the other dimension and how it 
seemed to multiple whatever powers fueled him. Maybe this was even 
the power fueling him? No time to think now, I have the disk and can 
figure that out. Now, just concentrate on defeating Adonis and 
rescuing Hotaru. And DO IT FAST!
	Goddamn it, that was hurting! Currents of enormous powers 
were channeled through my body from the glowing Venus Tear and it was 
fluctuating, hard. Fading in and out of existence what made it even 
harder to set up a good defense or strike effectively. I had tried to 
cast magic but that was no good at all. All what I had to rely on was 
the transformed crystal that I didn&#39;t even fully understand myself. 
Not a very reassuring thought.
	Another clinging noise accompanied by the familiar sound of 
discharging electricity and another jolt rocked through my body, 
stunning me almost. I gritted my teeth and pressed back, twisting my 
weapon in an attempt to disarm my opponent but he yanked my weapon 
down with his and a sharp pain traveled up my arm. The first I really 
felt what it was like to be wielding such a powerful weapon like the 
Crystal of the Weeping Unicorn. Damn, that stung and that pain. I had 
to hold out, had to win, had to save Hotaru...
	I cried out in mind-blazing pain as a lightning bolt crashed 
right into my sight. Trying to clamp down on the pain, I grabbed the 
crystal blades almost painfully hard. The Tear flickered, violently. 
Stay focused. Your emotions only. Your positive ones, ignore the 
pain. Again the Tear flickered, dimming. No, no, not now, not yet! 
And blinked out completely, simply vanishing. And with that the last 
light faded out from the dimension.
	A cracking sound. It sounded almost like a shackle bursting 
and it came from behind me but how... Another hot wave of pain shot 
through me as I was hit again, this time in the stomach. I stumbled 
backwards and fell to the ground, hard. How can you fall, especially 
hard, in a void? &quot;I really don&#39;t want to do this,&quot; Adonis voice rang 
out and threw the dancing lights in front of me I could make out that 
his eyes were... gleaming? Like pools of pitch-black darkness. 
Nothingness. &quot;But since you&#39;re so stubborn, I think I do you a 
favor.&quot; His voice was monotone, as he began to walk slowly towards my 
broken form, the blade in his eyes emitting a low hum.
	There, another crack! What was that? Never mind that now. 
Desperately I tried to reach back into subspace and retrieve the 
Venus Tear, straining myself to the very end of my reserves. It was 
no use. The light of the ancient artifact was gone, refused to answer 
my call. The darkness... nothingness around it was impenetrable. What 
could I do? What should I do? I couldn&#39;t give her up here! Hotaru, 
she needed me, she was relying on me, BELIEVING in me. I could NOT 
fail her! But I did, didn&#39;t I. I had tried everything, every trick, 
every maneuver I and Priapos had worked on it training. Adonis had 
met them all with a skill that betrayed everything what was possible.
	Another crack. What the hell was going on there? I couldn&#39;t 
look back, my eyes were glued on the approaching form of the crazed 
man, I had once, a long, long time ago called a friend, a fellow 
Venusian. But now, now I only hated him. Weak, obsessed, controlled 
again and again. And he had hurt my mate. I couldn&#39;t let him go away 
with that, right? No way... but what could I do? There was nothing I 
could do. I failed, failed in the only battle that ever had a true 
purpose, a demanding purpose... for myself.
	&quot;Since you decided to waste your life, instead of changing 
it, I will free you now from your bonds, from your mission.&quot; I could 
make out something... A shadow? A looming shape of a person? A cape? 
Two gleaming eyes blazed in the nothingness around us and so did 
Adonis in return. Kuso, he really was possessed. I didn&#39;t pity him of 
course. In that situation that was one life I was willing to take. 
For Hotaru&#39;s sake. And maybe, just maybe a little bit for myself, 
Hebe strongly included. I was willing but I lacked the ability... How 
ironic.
	Energy crackled as Adonis raised his blade, the tip flashing 
with energy. I tried to push myself up in a feeble attempt of 
avoiding the inevitable. &quot;Hotaru,&quot; I whispered quietly, closing my 
eyes in defeat. &quot;Gomen nasei...&quot; The sound of discharge again, the 
air loaded heavily with energy moving fast. But there, there was 
another crack. The fourth one... I waited for the final blow to 
strike, to end it all. I had known that I might die, that I had no 
idea what I was getting myself into. But I had been prepared for 
this, dying for Hotaru seemed a good thought. I just wished I would 
have taken him with me at least, so that Hotaru could be free. Kuso.
	I waited for the impact, waited, waited... and waited. 
Silence. An almost comforting silence. Then there was a soft, yet 
still chilling whisper. *Enough of this.* And like a bonfire I felt a 
presence literally explode behind me. My eyes snapped open and my 
head whipped around, staring in wide-eyed, open-mouthed wonder at the 
scene unfolding. My precious Firefly was... GLOWING! Her hands now to 
the side, completely free of any bondage. Her body was rigid, the 
head thrown back. And there was so much ENERGY! There was an inhuman 
piercing scream as something emerged from my mates form, a shadow of 
some sorts, and vanished with an agonized howl.
	However, I did not pay attention to that. Hotaru&#39;s hair was 
whipped back and with a blinding suddenness of a flashlight turned on 
in the darkness, a symbol blinked into existence. A familiar symbol, 
a familiar, astrological symbol. A symbol that froze me to the spot 
and that made Hebe scream bloody murder inside of me. The symbol of 
the last Senshi. The forbidden one, the one that brought the end and 
the beginning. The symbol of Saturn... AND IT WAS ON HOTARU! &quot;No,&quot; I 
shook my head violently, as if the motion would ward of the image and 
the implications. Hebe had quieted down and was now stunned into 
disbelieving silence. &quot;Oh, Serenity, please no...&quot;
	The violet energy surrounding Hotaru by now was like a 
cocoon, a swirling mess of destructive force. And with one last flash 
it burst, revealing the person that I dreaded, reality gripping my 
heart in its icy grip. The long, gleaming and not only deadly but 
destructive glaive in one hand, the unmistakable white-violet fuku, 
the cold, unfazed eyes that could make a mountain shiver. The Senshi 
of Saturn in all her glory... and... with a smile?

(Artemis)
&quot;I was afraid of that.&quot; I felt Minako&#39;s eyes on me, hard, but I 
didn&#39;t care at the moment. They would linger there only for a moment 
anyway before retreating to the form of her girlfriend, now in all 
her reawakened Senshi glory. Sailorsaturn, the Senshi of Silence 
under the protection of the forbidden planet of destruction. The one 
that even the greatest evil feared and the highest good dreaded 
because she was... The Silent Messiah. That&#39;s what the Senshi from 
the ring planet had been baptized with.
	There was a distinct pattern to her work, a cruel and inhuman 
pattern actually - but one that the majority seemed to find 
necessary. I could not really speak against it. If Evil ever gained 
the upper hand in the endless struggles against Good and there was no 
chance to reclaim peace again, then She was to awaken. She was the 
ultimate weapon, gifted by powers far beyond understanding and nobody 
really know from what they originated. Sailorsaturn was a mystery... 
No, not a mystery, more like the very symbol of the ultimate judge. 
The one who everyone had to answer sooner or later, the Black Man, 
the Grim Reaper, Death... What ever you wanted to call him/her. 
That&#39;s what Saturn was and ever will be, in her case its just the 
universe she judges.
	Okay, not really judging, since she is on the side of Good. 
Her task was to reset what had been stained, cleanse what had been 
darkened with evil. A new cycle of life. Death and Rebirth. An end 
for a new beginning. And Sailorsaturn always only did it once. When 
she was awakened... Like now... Right? So... why was she smiling and 
why were we still alive?
	I wondered, if Hotaru in her desperation might have called 
out deliberately to the Senshi of Silence, that she had somehow asked 
for her help. As ridiculous as this sounds, I did have had the 
feeling that this might happen. After all there was - HAD BEEN - a 
demon residing in young Hotaru&#39;s body and as much as it concerned a 
sleeping Senshi&#39;s presence, that must have been awfully unsettling, 
to say the least. I&#39;m sure Saturn was not happy about it and all to 
eager to help out.
	Yet, the most powerful Senshi was not one to simply trust to 
just act because she was uncomfortable. For what I knew, she could 
have slept on in Hotaru, as if she had no care in the world. Her 
mission was to awaken at the appropriate time, what should she care 
about her reincarnated self? She could rip the demon apart then she 
decided to emerge finally, when she was called. So why did 
Sailorsaturn care now. This, as grim as the situation looked, was not 
the grand final setting on the door to oblivion as the downfall of 
the Silver Millennium had been. Hardly.
	Then that left only one possibility I had talked about with 
Priapos already. Saturn felt obligated to the Senshi bond. I could 
simply find no other possibility and I didn&#39;t even wanted to think of 
another. If Saturn was here to destroy everything, that she was 
awakened by accident and actually thought her time had come... The 
thought gave me a shudder and let my hair stand up... As if the air 
around wasn&#39;t enough all of a sudden. Deadly cold, chilling, silent.
	The transformation had ended finally - or should I say 
already? The tiara faded back in, covering the glowing sign of 
Saturn, the Silence Glaive touched the ground, making no noise at all 
and it&#39;s wielder followed, as soundless as the weapon. And the smile 
was still there. What the heck was she smiling at? Saturn didn&#39;t 
SMILE! It was unnerving really and then her eyes focused, cleared of 
the pools of power, I shivered under the critical, yet so indifferent 
gaze she swept over us. Then her eyes settled on Adonis, they 
hardened. And somehow, somehow I knew that we would survive this 
whole mess.

(Saturn/Rhea)
Power. Building power. An awareness I had not felt in ages, eyes 
opening for the very first time since the reincarnation to the 
reality outside. My own eyes now, I mean, sort of anyway. Ripples of 
energy crawled over my body, cleansing the skin below and giving my 
host a complete healing of any aftereffects or manipulations Tomoe 
Souichi had done to it. A complete new life. And for the first time 
in millennia I lived.
	Floating down to the ground gently I noted in dismay that my 
first touch with reality was in a non-reality of some sort. I could 
not quite say where but it was somewhat familiar. And it was 
lifeless. Well, that was actually perfect. I felt myself smiling at 
the thought. I just had to be careful with myself, my... mate and her 
partner. Nobody else, nothing to worry about. Whoever created this 
had given me a good opportunity he wasn&#39;t even aware of. Of course I 
knew who had caused it. I was more concerned about the powers behind 
the foolish Venusian.
	My eyes drifted through the void brushing quickly over the 
Mau cat glancing at me with something akin to understanding. Yes, I 
think he understood... something. Not everything. I saw the mixed 
emotions cleared played upon his small face. I continued smiling and 
it made me almost giggle at how much it made him nuts. Almost.
	Then my eyes fell on Venus and were locked in place for an 
endless moment. Granted I had not been particular happy about the 
choice my host had made. It was... awkward. Everything was so 
different, so unexpected. I had come here by request but I still 
didn&#39;t really know what I was to do here What was my place, my 
mission? There did I fit into this whole situation? Surely, not 
because I should reset everything again, what would be the purpose to 
include me in a rebirth cycle then? Maybe I was actually here to... 
help.
	The thought was strangely comforting. For a long time, I had 
only known the lonely planet that was my resting place. The forbidden 
paradise that lay behind what the eye could see. All alone, only for 
one single purpose in my life. Death. Ironically it really was and as 
I shifted my hold on the Silence Glaive, I felt the heavy weight of a 
cruel and unfulfilled fate resting hard upon my shoulders. Oh, how I 
had wished to live, how I had wished to go out and live. Like the 
others did, like all of them did. All except me. I was kept away, 
locked away, not allowed to go. I had a duty but it was a prison 
actually. Even Pluto did have it better than me.
	As my eyes met Venus&#39;, absent of any particular differences 
between Hebe and her host at the moment, my eyes softened. She had 
made Tomoe Hotaru happy and Hotaru had made her happy. Simple as it 
is, it was so much more worth. Especially to me. We were the same 
person after all. Even if Hotaru didn&#39;t know it, even while I slept 
on and wasn&#39;t really aware of anything, that had stirred me. Their 
happiness. And it made me smile thinking about all the sweet moments -
 and the intense ones, that I had unintentionally briefly shared. 
Hotaru was happy, Hotaru was me and she LIVED!
	Still. Duty first.
	The moment passed as my gaze swung to the last figure in the 
room. The tainted figure. The enemy. What a pitiful excuse of a 
minion and a minion he was, no doubt. There were much greater powers 
at work here that were yet to reveal themselves but by concept of 
fate weren&#39;t my responsible. Not at the moment anyway. My eyes 
hardened and I noted grim satisfaction when the little peasant called 
Adonis made a step back under my famous death glare. I had enough 
time to work after all, millennia spent on a lone planet. I moved my 
deadly weapon ever so slightly and Adonis shuddered. &quot;That, that 
can&#39;t be...&quot; he whispered, his voice laced with terror, as if he 
stared the devil in person in the eye. Well, in his case he probably 
would have welcomed that.
	&quot;Rhea.&quot; I blinked - something I didn&#39;t do in a VERY long 
time - at the tiny, shaken voice and then I turned my head back to 
Venus, I saw now beyond doubt Hebe&#39;s eyes looking back at me. 
Uncertain, scared a little - or maybe a hell lot of it - unbelieving, 
shaky... I could not blame her. &quot;It has been a long time,&quot; I mused 
with a distinct undertone of emotion that I allowed myself. Yes, it 
had been a long time. A long time since my calling. A day full of 
honor and yet the beginning of a half-self-chosen exile. The other 
Senshi had been there. It had been the only time that I saw them. But 
I remembered... I remembered the face of young Hebe, her face 
outraged and definitely affronted by the idea of supporting my fate. 
But she didn&#39;t have a chance back then, did she? No, not really. It 
had all been written down in stone. It was moving nonetheless and 
just the thought I was not just some sort of too powerful criminal 
who needs to be locked away, had given me some resolve to follow my 
calling with less dreading. It didn&#39;t help though. But what would you 
expect after a millennia?
	&quot;Yes...&quot; Hebe&#39;s whisper brought me back to reality. &quot;Yes, it 
has...&quot; Without really noticing I had crossed the distance between us 
and laid one hand on her shoulder, healing magic traveling over her 
crumbled form, as she stared up with wide, unblinking eyes. I could 
really not hold my host&#39;s choice against her. And it would be too 
late anyway. Truth to be told, I couldn&#39;t have cut the bond, even if 
I wanted too.
	I tried to look reassuringly. It is hard I tell you, after 
such a long time as the Senshi of Silence, the emotional cold bringer 
of the end, it was hard to show emotion and do it right. &quot;Don&#39;t be 
afraid. I might not be... pleased with all this but... I have to 
value the bond. My time has not yet come... and it will never come 
again like you remember it.&quot; She opened her mouth to say something 
but no sound came out, as I turned around again.
	Yeah, it was not my time yet. It was Hotaru&#39;s life, her 
happiness. And now with the demon gone, she could live it. I was not 
ready yet. There was still time left and I had to wait. Until then, I 
could only be happy for them. Happiness. A strange feeling. Almost 
alien to me, maybe it was alien to me. What happiness did I have 
known as my existence as Princess Rhea? Not much. My childhood ended 
early, too early, and even that was filled with lessons to prepare me 
for my duty. The duty only I could carry out, because I was chosen. I 
was not allowed to be happy.
	Yes, I was melancholic here. It wasn&#39;t like I totally hated 
it. I knew the reason behind this actions, I understood them even, 
feeling the power I could command with a single thought, coursing 
through my body. Such power should never be lifted onto ones 
shoulders. Yet it was and the one was me. Me alone, Rhea, 
Sailorsaturn. Tomoe Hotaru should not be burdened with it. The child 
was still young, had her live before her. Especially now, since she 
was free. Life, freedom. Yes, in a little while, I would be sharing 
this with her, lessening the burden a bit.
	All that shot through my head as I turned around to face the 
actual crux of the problem again. Yeah, well, I snorted, what a 
problem he presents. That was then something shot passed me and I had 
no time to bring my shield back up. A sharp outcry of pain. Hebe&#39;s 
voice. &quot;I have enough of this! You can&#39;t hurt me! Don&#39;t you all 
realize that you are all prisoners of yourself? I will not let it end 
this way again!&quot; Adonis voice rang out over the void area, shaking, 
on the verge of madness. I froze in my tracks, staring at the seconds 
before freshly healed and now sprawled out form of the other Senshi 
on the ground.
	Then, very, very slow, I turned back to the source of the 
attack. An unfamiliar sense of unyielding, piercing cold anger rose 
in me, as I felt the pain of Venus, as if it was mine. Oh yeah, 
almost forgot, the bond. I was the active one now, so it bounded me 
and Venus. &quot;That,&quot; I spoke quietly but my voice clear like ice and 
sharp like a knife, &quot;was a pathetic mistake.&quot; And Adonis WAS 
terrified under my cold, accusing gaze. Even clouded by darkness, 
yielded too almost maddening obsession, his survival instincts were 
still intact. And the Venusian knew perfectly well that his life had 
just been judged. Death sentence.
	Bringing the Silence Glaive in front of me, I heard the sharp 
intakes of breath behind me, both from a hard briefing Venus as well 
as her guardian cat. Frantically Adonis tried to stop me. Bolt after 
bolt of negative energy bounced of my form or was drawn right into 
the tip of the glaive that had started to glow in a bright dark 
light. Attack after attack was flung at me but I could not been hurt. 
Not by the destructiveness of the power, that was my element too. I 
felt the odd presence behind the void slowly retreating and Adonis 
actions weakening in response but not ceasing. &quot;Pathetic.&quot;
	I smiled again, an icy smile. &quot;You have wronged my host and 
tried to shatter her bond with the Senshi of Venus. That was a great 
mistake, fool. You&#39;ve called for your own downfall, from the 
beginning wandering a path not suited, not meant for you. You were 
blind and refused to see the truth. Now, this has gone too far. Meet 
your fate.&quot; I could almost feel the other two behind me shivering and 
Adonis... Well, he stood there stock-still, a look of dawning 
realization creeping into his face, for a brief moment pushing the 
insanity away. The look of a man scared for his life. And he had 
every reason to be.
	Ribbons of darkness - shadows, not the non-substance around 
us - began to pour out from the Silence Glaive, gathering around the 
ancient weapon, as I sharpened my concentration, carefully 
manipulating my given power for the intended task. I rarely ever had 
to control much before, just set it right, so that there was actually 
something left for rebirth. However, this time, this time I would use 
my power for something else than my duty. For my personal duty, to 
myself. For the obligation I earned Tome Hotaru.
	If I did this right - and I would do it right - then she at 
least could live a few years of peace, relishing in her love, in a 
strange relationship with my mutual counterpart. I wondered briefly, 
if that was fate&#39;s way of apologizing for the millennia of 
loneliness. Maybe it was. And I could grew to love it. But not now. 
Not yet. Now it was Tomoe Hotaru&#39;s time for awhile, free of any 
demons, free of physical health problems. She could live and I would 
wait. Because it made me happy, when she was happy. We were one. It 
was time to give her her life back. It was nice as long as it lasted.
	&quot;DEATH REBORN REVOLUTION!&quot; And the Silence Glaive went down...

----------------------------
	Somewhere in the labyrinth of corridors two figures stopped 
in their running, blinded and pushed back by the explosion of energy 
bursting through the whole base, making it impossible to see or feel 
anything.
	(...)
	Miles away, back home in Tokyo, a girl with brown hair tied 
into the ponytail stopped her late-night cooking for a moment, then 
glanced out at the sky and shivered. Nearby a blue-haired student put 
down her pencil and rubbed at her studies, shivering as well. In a 
temple not far away a raven-haired miko shrank back as her late fire 
reading had an unexpected result. The Sacred Fire had gone out.
	(...)
	And in a house of a seemingly normal family, a blonde girl 
jerked slightly in her sleep and the black cat with the Crescent Moon 
on her forehead looked up sharply, her eyes widening slightly. After 
awhile she frowned. &quot;What the heck was that?&quot; Puzzled and thinking 
what her friend had gotten himself into back in England, she lay back 
down, now deeply troubled. Neither of the two room occupants noticed 
the faint glowing of a Crescent Moon insignia on the girl&#39;s forehead.
----------------------------

(Venus)
White. Everything went wide and... silent.
	I blinked my eyes dizzily, trying to regain my bearings. An 
additional attempt of pushing myself up was delayed when I winced 
from numbing pain. Gah, I felt like I&#39;ve rode right through the hell. 
The special tour with the very special torments. What the heck 
happened? I tried to work my way through the haziness of my mind, 
while my vision slowly returned. I was in the middle of rubble, ruins 
actual. The wind was heavy and tore relentless through my shredded 
fuku... There I could make out a small figure, dark hair, pale 
skin... Hotaru! The damn of dizziness cracked open and all the 
memories flowed back striking like many tiny hammer blows, turning 
into a crescendo of conflicting thoughts and emotions. Hotaru. 
Kidnapped. Facing Adonis. Losing. Saturn... Oh, Serenity, what were 
you thinking? Hotaru WAS Sailorsaturn!
	A groan alerted me that I had better set aside this 
disturbing thought and tend to my mate. Whether or not she was the 
most powerful Senshi that ever walked Earth... or the universe for 
that matter. Gritting my teeth, I slowly crawled over, my hands 
getting scraped by the rubble - did the base actually blow up? Kuso, 
this last blast from Adonis had nearly killed me. I think, all in all 
we should be really, REALLY glad that we were still alive... And that 
the planet still existed.
	I shook my head, trying to shake off thoughts of the alter 
ego of my girlfriend wielding the gleaming Silence Glaive, inflicting 
destruction with three words and one motion. It was no good, I just 
couldn&#39;t get that image out of my head and I was sure it would stay 
burned there for the rest of my life. I passed Artemis on my way and 
spared him a glance but he seemed to be okay. Lucky cat, didn&#39;t get 
hurt at all. Just unconscious. I crawled further down until I reached 
the fragile looking form of my lover, my soul mate, my one and 
everything, who just about now opened her eyes.
	I drew in a sharp breath, trying desperately to ward of the 
images of Saturn replaying themselves again and again. I could not 
let her see me scared. Scared of her. Scared didn&#39;t even described 
it... But let&#39;s not go there. Couldn&#39;t let her see... That is, if she 
was still Hotaru. Or had Saturn taken over permanently? That was what 
I was worried about when blue orbs met deep violet ones. Confused, 
somewhat frightened, eyes of someone who just lived through and 
survived a kidnapping by her lover&#39;s obsessed suitor - I was not in 
the least bit sorry about what Saturn had done to him without 
remorse. However, that wasn&#39;t Saturn, that was sweet, little Hotaru. 
And she looked like she might break every moment at the sight of me.
	&quot;Minako?&quot; Her voice sounded weak, faint and scared. I reached 
out with a tentative hand, resisting my urge to tremble, and brushed 
through her dark hair. &quot;I&#39;m here, Raven. I&#39;m here...&quot; As if a dam 
broke somewhere inside of her, she let out a great sob of relieve, 
fright and other mingling emotions, burying her head in my chest. I 
winced a little but ignored the slight burn of pain riding roller 
coaster in my system and simply stroke her hair, afraid despite 
everything, despite Saturn to ever let her go. Never again. She would 
never again endure such a thing. That I swore to myself even before I 
heard her mumble: &quot;What happened, Mina-chan... I... I don&#39;t 
remember...&quot;
	She looked up at me and again I felt my emotions go in 
dizzying circles, as I tried to shut out the memory of Saturn under 
the inquiring gaze of this frightened and confused eyes of my mate. I 
knew I was doing a miserable job of it, when her expression changed 
to utterly terrified. &quot;I... I didn&#39;t to anything bad, did I? Oh, 
kami, please tell me nothing happened that...&quot; I cut her off the only 
way I knew would work. I kissed her.
	Relishing in the feel of lip contact, the familiar rush of 
reviving energy - physically as well as mentally - all those troubles 
were suddenly washed away. I had my Hotaru back. It didn&#39;t matter, if 
she was Sailorsaturn as long as she didn&#39;t destroy everything. At 
least after this incident I knew for certain, but I also knew for 
certain that the now sleeping Senshi would surely protect my mate... 
Never mind the fact that I was effectively bonded TO Sailorsaturn... 
No, that really didn&#39;t matter right now. I had my Hotaru back, that 
was all that counted.
	&quot;Nothing is wrong, Little Firefly, nothing happened, 
nothing...&quot; I whispered softly and held her tightly, never mind the 
protest of my body as we sat there for a long moment. I looked 
sideways as I sensed Artemis next to me and gave him an inquiring 
look. I had not forgotten that he had apparently known about the 
sleeping Saturn but I really didn&#39;t feel like arguing right now. The 
white cat just shook his head tiredly. He had at least the grace to 
look apologetically.
	&quot;Really, Hebe, did you have to blow up the whole building?&quot; 
Priapos clear voice rang through the air in a playfully chiding 
manner as she flattered into view. I scowled at her but couldn&#39;t 
suppress a small smile as I looked down at Hotaru&#39;s form who had 
slipped away into mild unconsciousness again. Not me, Pria, not me. 
The elf was silent after catching my look. I guess she knew too then, 
given the startled look on her face.
	After a while of silence, I felt her hand on my shoulder and 
looked up to her. Priapos face was soft and compassionate. &quot;Let&#39;s go 
home. We heard sirens in the distance.&quot; And with a great of effort 
she helped Hotaru and me up, as we limped away from a place that 
would forever be stuck in our memory as a place of great distress, 
alarming revelations and the beginning of a new, stony road. A 
beginning with no predictable end.

THE END... of the beginning

Epilogue

(From the diary of Tomoe Hotaru)
I cannot tell you how good it feels to finally be OUT again! To see 
the light, fresh air. Heck, I could have danced in the usual British 
rain for all I cared, if Minako hadn&#39;t sternly scolded me for it. She 
is awfully protective of late but I guess that is only normal after 
what happened and I find myself rather enjoying the attention. 
Although she becomes awfully quiet every time conversation only 
scratches the topic Adonis and what happened at the base. my 
girlfriend told me that he has been taken care of. I should not 
worry. But she never said, it was by her doing. And somehow I doubt 
it.
	I could not tell why but I feel that I have at least 
something to do with it. The last thing I remember was fending of 
Adonis advances and then... calling out to someone, a plea... As hard 
as I tried I could not penetrate the hazes of memory and I am not 
really sure, if I really want to. There is something important I 
forgot, I am sure of it, a face, two actually, a place somewhere 
else, not on Earth. That&#39;s about everything and it doesn&#39;t make 
sense. Not much anyway.
	However, I feel at peace now, the demon is gone. Not 
sleeping, not calmed by the pendant I&#39;m still wearing although I 
doubt I need it anymore. The dark, omniscient presence is finally 
gone. And I feel strangely free. There is still something in there 
but the other presence, I have always felt more at ease with her, 
like she is a part of me. Maybe it has something to do with what 
happened back at the base. Maybe... But as I said I am better of not 
knowing, I guess. I will worry Minako less with that.
	The remaining time of our vacation slowly draws to an end but 
we have used the last weeks well. Kicking back and simply relaxing. 
No, Youma anymore, no fighting, no kidnapping, just us. And Priapos 
and Kathryn and Artemis. That was acceptable though, rather fun 
actually. The elf and I seemed to have simply jumped over the awkward 
state and instantly gone to liking each other. All in all it has been 
a very relaxing time.
	Even when we soon return home and I look back on it, all the 
hardships, the days of isolation and torment, I look at some quite 
exciting times. Times that were not really easy and simply relaxing 
but that still count as the best times in my young life so far. I 
have reached a turning point. My life has finally found a purpose. I 
have found unyielding love in Minako and I could not, would not trade 
this for anything, even if it meant canceling out the time in Adonis&#39; 
grasp. We are save now and that is all that matters. Us. Together. 
Both of us standing on the start of a path leading to our new, united 
life. A future surely to be looked forward to.

I can only say that I am a very happy, teenage girl at the moment. 
Just like it should be.

Yours

Hotaru

(From the diary of Aino Minako)
Then I actually allow myself to think back on the events of this dark 
day, I have the distant idea that Saturn... Rhea was... is lonely. 
There was this look in her eyes, that all too familiar emotion, I 
have known for so long.
	Loneliness has been a constant companion. Even then I was 
with the girls, even then I outwardly seemed to be the chipper, happy 
girl. Inside I always had been lonely. HAD BEEN. Not anymore. To 
think it all began on a rainy day in a lonely alley with a maybe, 
maybe fated meeting of two souls tormented by the ways of life... It 
is quite amusing actually how things have turned out. As the old 
saying goes... Takes one, to know one, right? Two lonely souls 
without purpose had found each other that day and created a shared 
purpose, themselves.
	That is why I keep thinking back to that lonely eyes barely 
visible behind the stoic mask of the Senshi of Silence. Somehow it 
reassures me to see that mark of humanity. Although it saddens me 
somewhat because the expression was so damned familiar. Well, I 
intent on making Hotaru happy and so I would grant Rhea the same 
pleasure, right? Hebe is awfully quiet then inquired about her own 
feelings about the other Senshi. I think she pities her, has pitied 
her... whatever. Anyway, the thought of Saturn being a part of my 
sweet girlfriend becomes almost bearable like this, almost.
	The time has come at last. Summer break was coming to an end 
and we have to head home. I will really miss the little city here, 
especially the bungalow with the lake setting. And I will definitely 
miss Hotaru beside me in bed... That will probably prove the hardest 
part. But we will manage somehow. After all, it was not, as if we 
were out of touch. And there are the weekends and the sleepovers. Can 
absolutely not forget about them.
	Priapos has decided to head home. To Venus. She wants to go 
and look, if maybe someone survived the Millennium&#39;s fall, some 
subspace pockets maybe. I would be glad myself, though I doubt it. 
However, you are allowed to hope right? We, being Artemis, Priapos 
and me, decided - swore - to keep quiet about the peculiar details of 
what had transpired in the few weeks here. It would not to any good 
for anyone&#39;s presence of mind that my girlfriend is Sailorsaturn. Not 
for Luna, who would probably throw a fit, and especially not for 
Hotaru herself.
	Not to forget the others. We are sure this was just the 
beginning and that the crisis is yet to actually begin. The disk has 
revealed some rather disturbing details and it is a question of time 
when the Sailorsenshi would be needed again to defend the world. 
After all that is our job. In due time the others would be needed to 
awaken and our eternal battle of Good against Evil would begin anew.
	Until then I plan on spending enough time living, enjoying 
Hotaru&#39;s presence at my side, as much as possible.

Love,

Minako

----------------------------
Somewhere in the ruins of a previously still at least intact if 
widely unused military base, the form of a black shadow could be seen 
rising slowly. A low chilly laugh rung through the air and it 
vanished.
	(...)
	The scene shifts to a dark space. A void with only one 
occupant. A young, teenaged girl with long brown hair, once upon a 
time known by the name of Tomoe Megumi. The shadow reappeared in 
front of the girl, hovered there for awhile, then chuckled evilly.
----------------------------

END Of PRELUDE, BEGIN OF MAIN STORY

Well, that was it. The whole, terrific story. Although I didn&#39;t allow 
myself to think about it at this time, I was a bit sorry about 
Adonis, only a bit. He was blinded like so many others and only 
partially understood what he was doing there. The Adonis I had known 
from my childhood as Hebe would have been outraged over what he did 
later.
	All in all, it was like we described it in our finishing 
entries. We had stepped onto a new path, together. A path leading to 
a better future and a lot of adventures ahead. But those will be 
handled in the main section.

Ja, yours

Minako and Hotaru

Author&#39;s Notes

*pant* I. Am. Finished. Phew, at least over ten, probably close to 
fifteen pages on the weekend. I wanted to finish this and well, I 
did! *smiles gleefully* Satisfied? Happy? I am. You too? Honestly 
that whole thing was a lot of fun and really got my lately rather 
lazy butt in gear to seriously stay focused on a series.

Now there are some things to clear up. First of all the time space 
since the accident. Yes, I know I wrote it in the time cheat that it 
was when Hotaru is around five. That is wrong though, since there is 
a definite age in the Manga. Which is eight. So Hotaru was eight 
years then and that makes it about six years from her age at this 
point. I hope I didn&#39;t make too much false references in the last 
chapter, if any, when I find them I clear them up.
Tomoe Keiko und Megumi. It is rumored that Hotaru had a sister. This 
is partially built on the Anime again, where it is said that only 
Souichi and his &quot;oldest&quot; daughter survived. There is no such 
reference in the Manga. But there is a reference to Keiko, at least 
her name.
I apologize for the rather bad picture, I gave Adonis in this part 
from Minako&#39;s point of view. But really, would you care a damn that 
the guy might have some good in him, when he held your lover captive 
and tormented her? I doubt so. Frankly, I think my portrait of Venus 
in this regard was realistic. She just didn&#39;t care.
If you&#39;re wondering what my strong references to heart and will were 
about. Well... That might be to a point influenced by MKR (Magic 
Knight Rayearth). I just received the DVDs a few weeks ago from eBay 
(Original with English subtitles) and might have been a little too 
much on the trip... I thought it suitable for Venus and the Tear in 
this regard and believe me, any reference was rather unintentionally.
There are a few mysteries, I don&#39;t want to talk about right now since 
they will play a major role in the upcoming rewrite. I think you all 
somewhat recognized most of the clues and hints. Not that Mistress 9 
was a hint... You will see sooner or later what this is all about and 
how our two lovers and the other Senshi will fare in their battle for 
peace.

I think, that was all for this chapter and for this fic. As I said, 
it was fun and I surely am not bored yet of this project. I don&#39;t 
know when I start with the R-series but you&#39;ll see, just watch out 
for it. At the moment I&#39;m having my hands on a MKR fic (with 
Hikaru/Umi). Watch out for &quot;Troubled Hearts&quot; soon.

Write me, I really appreciate any constructive feedback and if you 
got hook up on the couple, please, pretty please join my group 
(addresses above). We are so few.

At last, I want to dedicate this fic (all parts included) to my 
trusted beta-reader Athenia, who sadly will be off to college shortly 
and won&#39;t have time to beta anymore for me. I always appreciated your 
efforts, Athenia, and I think it actually helped over a few standard 
mistakes. I&#39;ll miss you.

Ja ne, yours
