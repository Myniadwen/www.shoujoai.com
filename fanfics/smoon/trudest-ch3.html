<h1>True Destiny (part 3 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/trudest-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;What?!  That&#39;s not even fair!  Michiru-san, I have to see Minako!&quot;

Michiru sighed tolerantly, chewing another tiny morsel of her meal 
before replying.  &quot;Rei-san, it makes more sense to go around Japan by 
going north and sailing around the west coast rather then heading south.  
The current will be more cooperative and the wind should be nicer, too.  
Then we can meet Minako when we sail around Kyushu to pass Okinawa 
before we reach Shikoku.&quot;
 
Rei crossed her arms.  &quot;I don&#39;t want to wait.  Why can&#39;t we go to Minako 
first?&quot;
 
Michiru chuckled, glancing at Haruka for a moment, sensing in the blonde 
something she had never met in another woman, though she had no idea 
what it was.  &quot;A little time apart will do you good, Rei-chan.  Besides, 
Setsu-chan has invited us to Hokkaido, and she wants to meet these two 
young fighters.  I, of course, told her that we would be there as soon 
as possible.&quot;
 
&quot;Isn&#39;t Tohoku just north of us?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Makoto-san, it is.  That Region is currently run by a regent of 
Aomori Family, Ken&#39;nin at the moment.  He has a wife but no daughters to 
continue his family&#39;s reign.  The former Duke and Duchess died 
tragically in a car wreck years ago, seventeen or so, and no one knows 
if they had a child at all.  The orphanages were searched in this great 
enterprise by the Queen to return Tohoku to its rightful ruler, but to 
no avail.  No one knows if Kazeko was ever pregnant.&quot;
 
&quot;Kazeko?&quot;
 
Michiru nodded, raising one slender eyebrow at her tall guest.  &quot;Yes, 
that was her name.  Why?  Do you know someone named Kazeko?&quot;
 
Haruka&#39;s dark green eyes went distant, clouding over as her fists 
clenched.  In her mind, she heard a soft voice, floating in her mind, 
calming her and silencing her cries.  &quot;My mother&#39;s name was Kazeko,&quot; she 
whispered, a rare smile spreading across her face.  &quot;She would sing me 
to sleep at nights, especially when I was upset.&quot;
 
&quot;How old were you when you lost her?&quot;
 
Haruka covered her face, shaking slightly.  &quot;Young.  I remember a loud 
noise, and white, and then I was in the orphanage and there was no more 
music, no one to sing me to sleep anymore.&quot;
 
Michiru placed a sympathetic hand on Haruka&#39;s shoulder.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Haruka-kun.&quot;
 
Makoto wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s waist and kissed her cheek.  
&quot;Just calm down, my sweet.  That was a long time ago.  I remember my 
parents sometimes, but there is nothing left to worry about.  They are 
dead and we are alone.&quot;  Haruka nodded and regained her composure, her 
attention returning to her food.
 
&quot;Your parents?  Who, Makoto-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Um, Meika and Meisha.  Why, Rei-chan?&quot;
 
Rei shrugged, sipping her drink.  &quot;No reason.  I thought I remembered 
something about a Kino Meika.  It was a very old article I was reading, 
though.&quot;
 
&quot;Was a plane involved?&quot;
 
Rei looked up sharply, and Makoto sat back.  &quot;What airplane, 
Makoto-san?&quot;
 
&quot;The one my parents died on.  I was told that my parents died in an 
airplane crash.  I was four or so at the time.&quot;
 
&quot;The Kino Meika I was reading about died in a plane crash with her 
husband and a dozen servants and distant cousins.  She was the Lady of 
Nagano Prefecture and the young Duchess of Chubu Region, heir to her 
mother&#39;s position.  But she and her husband of six years died on the way 
to her Crowning.  It was very tragic.  Her daughter was rumored to be on 
that plane, too, though in the wreckage no children&#39;s bodies were found.  
Now the Region is ruled by Regent Toyoma Eiki.&quot;
 
&quot;Why were you researching that tragedy?&quot;
 
&quot;Trying to find some sort of technicality in your adoption papers to get 
you away from Kurai,&quot; Rei admitted.  &quot;But your name brought up that 
file.  Kino is not an uncommon last name in Chubu, because of the Duke&#39;s 
ancient line, but Kino has never been common in Kanto.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s not from Kanto,&quot; Haruka was quick to clarify.  &quot;She was born in 
Nagano-ken.  That&#39;s what I heard from Kurai when I listened in on his 
conversations with his lieutenants.  I learned a lot that way.  I was 
born in Miyagi-ken.&quot;
 
&quot;Kino Meika&#39;s daughter was born in Nagano-ken.&quot;  Rei reached in her robe 
and pulled out a small notebook, rifling through the pages until she 
found a picture she had pasted opposite a list of information written in 
neat, precise hiragana and dozens of kanji.  Haruka took the book and 
the two fighters looked at the picture.
 
&quot;What is all this?&quot;  Haruka pointed at the black letters opposite the 
picture.
 
&quot;It&#39;s information on the Kino family,&quot; Rei explained, one eyebrow 
raised.  &quot;The picture shows Meika, Meisha, and little Makoto.  That&#39;s 
all written there.&quot;  Haruka shook her head.  &quot;Can either of you read?&quot;
 
Michiru placed a hand over her mouth to stifle her gasp of shock.  
&quot;Neither of you?  Not even hiragana?&quot;
 
&quot;No, we can&#39;t.  We never had the opportunity.  I mean, Mako-chan learned 
Hiragana before her parents died, but she&#39;s forgotten many of the 
letters; she never needed them in the Fighting Palace.  She taught me 
how to write my name, though, and she can write her own.  But as for 
this . . . we can&#39;t read hardly any kanji.&quot;  Haruka, determined to 
change the subject, pointed at the little girl standing between her tall 
parents.  &quot;She has brown hair and green eyes, just like Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s why I kept the picture.  If your parents were really Kino Meika 
and her husband, then you, Makoto-san, are the Duchess of Chubu.&quot;
 
Silence spread through the room.  &quot;Duchess?  I can&#39;t be a duchess.&quot;
 
&quot;You can, Mako-chan,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;I believe that you are royal.&quot;
 
&quot;What about you, Haru-chan?  You could be royal.&quot;
 
Haruka shook her head, pulling her hand out of Makoto&#39;s grasp.  &quot;I&#39;m 
not.  You be a Duchess and I&#39;ll just be a fighter.&quot;  Rei reached over 
and turned the page in her notebook.  Haruka gasped at the picture of a 
tall woman with short blonde hair, a tiny baby girl in her arms.  The 
baby had emerald eyes and short gold hair, and she was smiling at the 
camera.  &quot;Mother,&quot; Haruka whispered, feeling tears on her cheeks for the 
first time in years.  &quot;That&#39;s my mother, Rei-san.  Why do you have a 
picture of her?&quot;
 
Michiru was wondering much the same thing.
 
Rei pointed at the caption under the picture.  &quot;Can you read that, 
Haruka-kun?&quot;
 
The blonde bit her lip and traced the neat lines with one long finger.  
&quot;Ten&#39;ou,&quot; she whispered, recognizing the first kanji compound.  The 
second compound looked tantalizingly familiar.  &quot;This one . . . Kaze?  
And &#145;ko&#39;.  Kazeko.  Hey!&quot;
 
&quot;Read the rest.&quot;
 
&quot;Ten&#39;ou Kazeko and Ten&#39;ou&quot;&#151;she had to sound out the furigana written 
above the last kanji, three of the five or so Hiragana she actually 
knew&#151;&quot;Ha-ru-ka.  Haruka?  Me?&quot;
 
&quot;You,&quot; Rei confirmed.  &quot;Ten&#39;ou Kazeko, Duchess of Tohoku Region, and 
Ten&#39;ou Koshu had one child, a daughter named Haruka, who was born in 
Miyagi-ken.  There was only one record, including the original of this 
photo, in a very old file in Miyagi-ken.  After the unfortunate 
accident, this information was never made public.  I had to pull so many 
strings to find this picture of Kazeko and the daughter who is her 
heir.&quot;
 
Haruka stared at the Shinto priestess, unable to believe her ears or the 
picture she clutched in her hand.  &quot;That can&#39;t be true.&quot;
 
Michiru gently took the book from Haruka&#39;s grasp and looked at the two 
pictures.  She called two of her servants over and whispered something.  
They bowed and left, eager to please Michiru.  &quot;I will have these two 
leads investigated.  Rei-san, why didn&#39;t you say anything before?&quot;
 
Rei shrugged as she took the book back, glancing at the silent 
green-eyed women sitting on the other side of the table.  &quot;Until 
Haruka-kun told me where she and Makoto-san were born, I never connected 
them to the dead dukes.  I just kept these notes because one of my 
hobbies as a priestess is learning about the noble families of Japan.  
The Ten&#39;ou and Kino families were just two among dozens that I 
researched, including my own.&quot;  Rei flipped a few pages and showed the 
aqua-haired duchess the pictures of the Kaiou family and the Hino 
family.  &quot;Makoto-san, Haruka-kun; do either of you know how to write 
your names in kanji?  I know you don&#39;t know very many letters, but you 
mentioned that you know how to write your names.&quot;
 
Haruka took the brush pen that Michiru&#39;s servant handed her and looked 
at the paper in front of her.  Slowly, not trusting her own faint memory 
or Makoto&#39;s lessons, Haruka drew two straight lines horizontal and one 
down from the top line, curving it to the left.  The second vertical 
line she started at the second horizontal line, the shorter of the two, 
and curved left.  The second letter was formed by three horizontal 
lines, evenly spaced, with the center line the shortest, and one 
vertical line running from the first line to the third.  &quot;Ten&#39;ou,&quot; she 
whispered.  &quot;I am told that it means &#145;Sky King&#39; like the name of the 
seventh planet, Ten&#39;ousei.&quot;  Her first name took more time, consisting 
of almost a dozen strokes.  When she finished her name, Haruka looked 
up.  &quot;I do not know this kanji, and my vocabulary has always been 
limited by the rough manner of my life thus far.&quot;  She handed the pen 
and paper to Makoto.
 
The brown-haired girl was far more comfortable with the pen than her 
partner.  Her last name, Kino, consisted of &quot;tree&quot; and the kanji form of 
the possessive &quot;no&quot; and meant &quot;of wood/trees&quot;.  Her first name meant 
&quot;honesty&quot; or &quot;wisdom&quot;.
 
Rei showed her book to the pair and pointed at the kanji beneath the 
Kino family picture.  The kanji matched the ones Makoto had written.  
Silently, she turned to the Ten&#39;ou family picture and pointed to the 
name of the daughter.  The kanji for baby Haruka&#39;s name was identical to 
the one the blonde fighter had so carefully drawn.  &quot;It means 
&#145;distant&#39;,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;And she is you.&quot;
 
Haruka jumped out of her chair, shaking her head.  &quot;Not me,&quot; she 
whispered, turning away and almost running to her room.  Concerned, 
Makoto bowed quickly to Michiru and followed Haruka deeper into the 
palace.  She might get lost in her confusion.
 
Michiru watched the two women leave, her heart whispering to her, 
begging her to follow.  Haruka needed her, and something inside her 
needed Haruka.  Rei was silent for the rest of the meal, and Michiru was 
not inclined to start any conversation.</pre>
