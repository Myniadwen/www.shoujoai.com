<h1>The New Girl</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sarah.html">Sarah</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Note: In this story, all the girls go to the same school, unlike the 
manga and anime.  I also wish to say that I don&#39;t own the characters 
in sailor moon, though I wish I did!!! J/K.
***********************************************************************
    I sat in this caf&eacute; often enough to know all the waiters by first 
name, but yet I never knew any of the other costumers.  It wasn&#146;t like 
I didn&#146;t socialize or they didn&#146;t talk with me, but I just never got 
to KNOW them.  I got up with a sigh.
     &#147;What&#146;s the matter Kira?&#148; asked Lizzie, her green eyes sad for 
her friend.
    &#147;Nothing Liz,&#148; I replied, hitting her ponytail affectionately as I 
walked out the door.  Everything was different now, though.  I sat 
down and thought back to that eventful day I met Serena.
***********************************************************************
&quot;Class, this is Kira Chin.  She is joining our class.  Kira, would you 
please sit next to the blonde in the fifth row.  Serena will you raise 
your hand to show her where you are.  Good, now class..&quot; and as I 
walked to my seat, the teacher&#39;s droning were drowned by the face and 
chatter of this girl Serena.  Serena was exquisitely pretty, with long 
hair done in a odango look.  She had blue eyes to match her blonde 
hair.  The girl, Serena was talking to a boy with weird glasses, a 
girl with shoulder-length brown hair, and a girl with short blue hair 
who was also very pretty.  As soon as the teacher started her lesson, 
though, the guy and the blue haired girl turned their attention to the 
teacher, but the brown haired girl and the blonde remained talking.  
Suddenly the blonde turned to me and smiled. 
    &quot;I&#39;m Serena and this,&quot; said Serena, &quot;is my best friend Molly.&quot;
    &quot;Nice to meet you I said quietly, both in awe of this girl&#39;s 
beauty, and trying to be respectful of the lesson going on in the 
front of the room. As I just sat, staring at her, she looked at me 
strangely.
    &quot;You okay?&quot; she asked.
    &quot;Oh&#133;yeah, I&#39;m okay.  My names Kira, as the teacher said, Mrs. K., 
right?  But you can call me K, is that okay?&quot;  I said, my heart in my 
throat and the words rushing in a torrent.  I knew I wasn&#39;t making a 
good impression, but i was so nervous.  
    &quot;Who are you staying with?&quot; Molly asked.
    &quot;My Dad and baby brother,&quot; I said.
    &quot;Wears your Mom?&quot; Molly asked.  It took me a few seconds to 
answer.
    &quot;Heaven,&quot; I said quietly.  My family was still upset about 
everything.
    &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Molly said, almost as quietly as me.
    &quot;Hey, K, wanna hang out with some of my friends and I after 
school?&quot; asked Serena, trying to lighten the mood.  
    &quot;Sure,&quot; I said.  My Dad doesn&#146;t care if I stay out after school.  
My brother is in daycare until Dad gets home and he isn&#39;t home till 
8:00 usually.
    The school day went bye fast and I met some of Serena&#39;s other 
friends.
    &quot;This is Amy,&quot; Serena said pointing the girl with short blue hair 
she had been talking to this morning, &quot;and this is Lita, Rey, Mina, 
and my brother Sammy.  Lita was a tall girl in a year ahead of us at 
school.  She had emerald eyes and brown hair.  Rey was a little taller 
than Serena with Raven black hair.  Mina had golden hair like Serena&#39;s 
and the two of them looked and acted very similar, except the hair 
style.  I almost could have sworn they were identical twins!
    &quot;Rey,&quot; I said slowly, &quot;Do you work at the temple?&quot; 
    &quot;Yeah, why?&quot; she asked.
    &quot;I just think I saw you yesterday when my dad drove past it.&quot;  We 
arranged to meet in front of the school and then head for the open 
market and the mall.  I was planning on leaving at 5, so I could get 
homework done.
    When we got to the mall, I felt slightly excluded, but I didn&#39;t 
care, for all I wanted to do was stare at the beautiful Serena.  I 
knew I liked women, but this was more than i could take.  We didn&#39;t 
get there until 3:30 and I left abruptly at 4:15.  They couldn&#39;t 
understand. When I got home, Dad was still at work, so I sat down and 
quickly did my homework.  It was easy and I finished it bye 5.  When 
my mom died we had moved here and now I really missed my old 
girlfriend.  I went into my room and locked the door and didn&#39;t come 
out for 2 hours.  Little did I know, Serena had followed me home.  
When I was with my old girlfriend, we used to come and make out or 
more at my house after we finished homework, since both of my parents 
left me at home till at least 7 o&#39;clock at night most of the time.  So 
my body was used to having a lover and I hadn&#39;t had one for nearly two 
weeks since my mother passed away.  Add on that I had been staring at 
a dream babe all day and you come up with one horney chick, pardon my 
language.  Now I had forgotten to lock the front door, so in comes 
Serena, who hears my sound of pleasure as I try to release the pent up 
feelings of the last two weeks.  I was unaware that I was under 
scrutiny, but I would have payed big bucks to see the look on her 
face.  I don&#39;t know exactly what she did, but when I left my room 
feeling thousands of times more amiable, she was nowhere to be seen.  
I cooked dinner for my father and I and made some formula for my 
brother.  He was on his way home from the hospital for the first time 
when the car hit them and killed mama.  
    Now it must seem weird that my father was able to pack all of our 
stuff, have a funeral, and fly us to Japan in two weeks, but he did it 
only because we had been packing to leave for Japan anyways when mama 
got hit.  I was with my grandma and Dad and the baby were fine with 
only minor bruises and cuts.  It was a hard two weeks and it was two 
weeks with absolutely no privacy.
    When Dad got home, he was with a female co-worker named Lillian.  
I was steaming at my father, while trying to be polite to Lillian.  
It&#39;s harder than most people imagine.  Through from my 14 year old 
point of view this was a sin against my mother, especially since it 
had only been two weeks.  I wasn&#39;t very hungry that evening, even 
though I had prepared the meal and went to bed early.
    &quot;&quot;Pspt!  It&#39;s me Serena, by your window,&quot; a voice said as I laid 
on my pillow.  My heart skipped a beat.  What was she doing here?
    &quot;Shouldn&#39;t you be home Serena?&quot; I asked, my mouth finally getting 
off the rug and back to it&#39;s normal position.
    &quot;Yeah, but my mom will understand.  Who&#39;s that lady your dad was 
talking with?&quot; she asked.  I felt anger boil up at the thought of her.
    &quot;She&#39;s a co-worker of my father&#39;s who he invited to dinner,&quot; I 
said coldly.
    &quot;You know, we don&#39;t really know each other that well, but can I 
ask you a personal question anyways?&quot; she asked very quietly.
    &quot;Sure,&quot; I said enthusiastically.  &quot;You could ask me anything 
Serena!&quot;
    &quot;Well,&quot; she began slowly, &quot;when did your mom die?&quot;
    &quot;About two weeks ago,&quot; I said this fast so I wouldn&#39;t have to 
really think about it.  This question had made me have painful 
memories, but the next question wounded me pretty deep.
    &quot;Did your parents love each other?&quot; she asked.  I began to regret 
saying she could ask anything.
    &quot;That&#39;s a hard question Serena.  Their marriage was arranged, so 
they weren&#39;t given much of a choice of if they loved each other or 
not, but they always respected each other and they loved me and would 
have loved my brother, had she not died first,&quot; I said slowly.  I knew 
they had gotten into arguments, but they held a respect for each other 
about the parental roles.  They loved each other in that they loved 
their children together.  Serena seemed to understand this more than I 
thought she would, and we talked long past the time I should have been 
asleep.
    The next day at school, I was a little grouchy, but not too bad 
considering I had stayed up half the night.  Serena, I noticed, didn&#39;t 
show up the next day for school until just before lunch.  Her excuse 
was that she didn&#39;t hear her alarm go off.  She smiled at me when she 
sat down.  Serena and I didn&#39;t have any more late night chats for 
awhile, but we did hang out during school and sometimes at the mall.  
During the month that all this went on, my adoration of Serena was 
growing.  Then one day, she invited me to her house, since her parents 
were gone.
    &quot;Yeah, they went on a trip with Sammi and left me alone for the 
weekend,&quot; she told me.  I was so happy to be able to spend some alone 
time with the woman I adored.  
    I came over, wearing my nicest blouse and some matching blue 
jeans.  I looked okay, but when Serena opened the door, she looked 
great.  We sat down, and Serena was talking animatedly about something 
when out of the blue, I put my finger over her mouth.
    &quot;What are you doing?&quot; she asked through the finger.
    &quot;Shh,&quot; I said quietly, and leaned over and kissed her.  Suddenly, 
I hear something behind me break and the brief touch of Serena&#39;s lips 
was gone.  I looked back, dreading a parent&#39;s early return, only to 
find a college-age man staring at me
    &quot;Who are you,&quot; we both asked at the same time.  Then we looked at 
Serena.  The boy was getting awfully red in the face and I knew 
something bad was about to happen.
    &quot;Kira, this is Darien, my boyfriend,&quot; Serena said wiping her lips, 
and my kiss away.  &quot;Darien, this is Kira and I have no idea where that 
kiss came from.&quot;
    &quot;Serena...I&#39;m sorry...You never told me you had a boyfriend, or I 
wasn&#39;t listening if you did.  Darien, I&#39;m sorry I intruded,&quot; I said, 
picking up my stuff and heading for the door, my dreams smashed into 
the rubble.  I was too embarrassed to look at Darien in the eye, but I 
laid my hand on his shoulder to utter another apology, but he roughly 
shoved my hand away.
    &quot;It isn&#39;t her fault you ass!&quot; I yelled at him, not knowing why, 
then running out the door as I felt him spin to watch my exit.
***********************************************************************
    Now that I had thought about it, the reason I didn&#39;t know anyone&#39;s 
name is because before now, I had always come with Serena and I had 
had no need to know anyone else&#39;s name.
    &quot;Hey Kira!&quot; Called a familiar voice.  It was Mina.  &quot;Serena told 
us about what happened between you and her.&quot;  I cringed.
    &quot;I guess she never wants to see me again, huh?  You the bearer of 
bad news?&quot; I asked.
    &quot;No on both accounts, actually,&quot; she said, her eyes dancing as I 
turned to her, my eyes alight with renewed hope.  &quot;Serena wanted me to 
tell you that she and Darien apologizes for the way they acted and 
want to ask you to join us at Rey&#39;s Shrine for Karaoke?&quot; she 
continued.
    &quot;Of course, but when?&quot; I said enthusiastically.  Better a friend 
than an outcast.
    &quot;Tonight at five,&quot; she replied.  I gasped as I realized that was 
in a few short hours.  I would have ran off, but I saw that Mina 
wasn&#39;t done yet.  &quot;Um...&quot;she mumbled.  &quot; I kind of have a question for 
you.&quot;
    &quot;Ask away,&quot; I said, feeling nervous because of her nervousness.  I 
had never realized how different and similar she was to Serena.  
Serena would never, ever not just come out and say something.  Mina 
definitely had more of a head on her shoulders in that area.
    &quot;Is this about me being a lesbian?&quot; I asked slowly.  She blushed 
crimson.
    &quot;Kind of...&quot; she said.  I was puzzled.  &quot;Kira... I wanted to know 
if you could love me instead of Serena.  There I finally got it out!&quot; 
she said looking pleased with herself, but anxious for the answer.
    &quot;I&#39;ve not really even thought of it really, but with you being 
such a kind, beautiful, and intriguing girl, I have little doubt that 
if you work your charm on my, I&#39;ll be hoping to be caught in the trap 
of your love,&quot; I said softly.  She beamed and slowly, gently, bent 
down and kissed my lips with an explosion of feeling like I had never 
felt before.  I knew that it was not Serena who I loved, but my 
beautiful, beautiful Mina.
