<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Together<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  even rhythm of one set of heels echoed down the marble corridor and was  accompanied with a slightly off paced click-clack-clunk of another.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Is this… <em>thing</em> really necessary?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s called a dress, Rei. You can’t enter the throne room in those tattered robes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ch’.”  The Martian cursed, even as she slightly stumbled in the awkward  footwear the Venusian had forced her into. “Impractical.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako hid an irrepressible snicker behind her hand. “Deal with it. At least you clean up well. For a barbarian.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amethyst  eyes glared at the golden haired woman, but a comeback was not  forthcoming as they entered a brightly lit chamber. The Martian’s  forward momentum slowed to near a halt as she absorbed not only the  ornate marble and gold decorations, but the beauty of the two women who  sat on the throne.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Near mirror images with matching hairstyles,  the woman with silver hair owned the larger throne while the one with  blonde hair and a visibly younger appearance graced the smaller one at  its side. The mark of the crescent moon on their foreheads signified  them as Queen and Princess, and it was their presence that drew Rei’s  eyes from the other things, the other people in the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess then felt a gentle hand on the small of her back and realized  the Venusian was pushing her forward. “Step up, Rei.” She whispered in  Martian before addressing the two women on the throne in a different  language, “Queen Serenity, Princess Serenity, this is Rei, and-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  stepped away from Minako and locked gazes with the Queen and the  Princess. “And I am a Priestess of Mars.” The Martian declared this  boldly, and she could feel the Venusian fuming beside her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You didn’t tell me you could speak Common!” Minako snapped.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei regarded Minako with amused eyes. “You never asked. I may be of a <em>barbarian</em> people, but I am not uneducated, <em>Princess</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian nearly growled. Payback, after all, was a bitch.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  melodic laugh broke the room’s tension and the younger of the two  women, the Princess, rose from her throne. She descended the steps in a  slow and measured gait until the very last step, on which the long hem  of her white gown lodged under her delicate shoe, sending the woman  sprawling towards the floor, her arms pinwheeling and long golden  pigtails streaming out behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was the quickest of those  that lunged forward, and without thinking, she soon found a teary eyed  Princess Serenity in her arms. Watery, cobalt eyes peered up at her and  the Martian couldn’t help but notice the young woman’s petite frame and  apparent fragility. A slight blush dusting her cheeks, the Priestess  righted the heir to the Moon Kingdom and shrugged off her clinging  embrace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">That seemed to break the spell, and big, round crocodile  tears began spilling down the Princess’ face. “I’m sorry! “ She wailed.  “You’re just so beautiful, I had to get a closer look!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Frowning,  the Martian stiffened and backed up slightly, only to find herself  surrounded. Minako stood at her back, and behind her, two other women  stood at the ready; one was exceptionally tall with long brown hair  tied into a pony tail, and another woman, much shorter, with loose,  short blue hair; both had observant eyes trained not on the Princess,  but on Rei. The Martian forced herself to relax her posture, for she  could sense their mistrust and she was very aware that if she had to  fight over an apparent misunderstanding, she was terribly outnumbered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  only then did she realize that the Princess had never stopped her  animated gushing and was addressing those very women behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne,  Ami-chan? Mako-chan? Minako-chan? I can feel it.” Serenity’s voice was  a whisper as she approached Rei once more. A steady hand reached  forward and touched the flinching Martian’s cheek softly. “We’re all  together now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serenity-chan?” Minako’s quiet, unspoken question  hung in the air and was close enough to Rei’s ear to send a shudder  down the Priestess’ spine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Serenity.” The quiet voice of the  Queen was a gentle reminder and the Princess bowed to the Martian  slightly and returned to her throne, thankfully with less trouble than  her descent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Queen rose from her seat, her eyes trained on  the Venusian. “Please, leave us. Brief the others on your mission. The  Princess and I will receive it from the source.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bowing  obediently, Minako nodded to her two companions and together, they  turned to exit the throne room, but pausing at the door, she cast a  glance to the Martian’s back and reminded herself sharply, ‘<em>Serenity would treat a </em>stranger<em> no differently than she would a close friend, Minako. You know that.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Yet,  somehow, the click of the door latch sounded entirely too final in  Minako’s ears as she hesitatingly closed the heavy doors behind her.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
From  a wide bank of silver-gilded windows that lined one wall of the throne  room, the warmth of the Sun’s rays and the gentle blue glow of the  Earth where it hung low on the horizon washed the room in gentle tones.  The Queen’s smile was a indulgent one and despite herself, Rei felt her  guard lessen somewhat. She told her Queen of her meeting with Minako  and the cause for her invitation to court; her knowledge of the youma  that threatened not only her planet, but as she came to understand,  several of the solar system’s others as well.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Queen Serenity digested Rei’s knowledge calmly and with grace. It  was more than Rei could say for the Princess who had seemed thoroughly  bored and more intent to simply stare and smile at the Martian. The  hardened warrior would have mistaken the younger Serenity for a  brainless twit were it not for the Princess’ next statement,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You say you’re an orphan but you’re also heir to your planet, are you not, <em>Mars</em> Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess remained unaffected, unsurprised that these women would know such information. “I am.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Does anyone else know?” The Queen asked, commanding the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No?  But would it not be in your planet’s best interest to come forward and  identify yourself? Unite your fractured nations into one and together  you may have a better chance against your common enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Together?’</em> Rei asked herself. Self-sufficiency was the Martian way; first the  self, and then the tribe. “I am no greater or lesser than the sum of my  people. I do not wish to be differentiated. Even though I’ve known I’m  the heir to the throne, I always thought I could do more good as a  nameless priestess in the front lines of the battle against the youma  than as a Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But surely you could further your cause by becoming the rightful heir and ascending to the <em>senshi</em> position that the title of Princess would grant you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Senshi.” Rei turned thoughtful. “Like Minako?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.  You’ve seen her skill in battle. By becoming a senshi, you would be  able to tap into the powers of Mars. Think of how you could aid your  planet, your entire solar system with that power. Perhaps it is time  for you to become part of something larger, Mars Rei.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian’s clammy hands balled into fists, released, and then formed  fists once more. The candelabras that lined the stone walls flickered  as if disturbed by a gust of wind, regained their strength, and then  flared brighter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Princess Serenity stood, her hands clasped before her hopefully. “Please. Be one of my senshi, Rei-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Violet  eyes met cobalt and somehow, she couldn’t help but feel protective of  this young woman’s innocence. But she was getting in over her head  here, wasn’t she? If she were to accept, she would be signing up not  only for her planet, but for her Kingdom, for this Princess, and for  the other guardians who protected her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The younger Serenity  laughed, and the room was filled with her warmth. “Don’t rush your  decision, Rei-chan. For now, why don’t you get to know my senshi?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once  again, the Princess descended from the throne, and this time, she kept  her footing until she was standing in front of the taller Martian.  Smiling, she laid a hand on the other woman’s shoulder. “In fact, I  believe they’re waiting for you right now.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  brunette stood tall and crossed her arms. She paced the room  distractedly, not willing to sit in the plush chaise lounges or rest on  the luxurious couches. “That’s all well and good about the youma,  Minako-chan, but tell us about the woman.”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Exactly. What’s this<em> ‘Rei’ </em>business? You’ve known her for all of two days and you’re on such close terms?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mako-chan…” The small blunette laid a warning hand on her companion’s shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  okay, Ami-chan. Mako-chan’s right to be cautious.” Minako set her  goblet down on a glass table and sat forward, crossing her legs. “We  just… hit if off when we first met. The way we fought together… I don’t  know. It just works.” She gazed at her friends. “All I ask is that you  give her a chance, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women shared a brief glance. The taller of the two shrugged and the smaller nodded. They would trust their leader.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door to the senshi’s courtyard swung open and an aide stuck his worried  head in. “Ladies, the Priestess of Mars is…” Bushy eyebrows rose in a  panic as the raven haired warrior strode right past him and entered on  her own accord as though she owned the place, “here.” He finished  impotently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto leaned in close to her leader. “I see what you like about her,” she half whispered, half teased.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  one motion, the Venusian stepped on the tall woman’s foot, taking  particular care to grind her point of her heel into the other woman’s  unprotected foot for good measure, all while nodding to the aide, who  reluctantly shut the door behind their guest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite the others  in the room, the two women looked only at each other. It had been the  longest they’d been apart since they’d met and the Venusian couldn’t  help but notice the troubled look in the warrior’s violet eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I see our Princess let you go.” It was a simple statement, yet it was meant as a challenge, and Rei took Minako’s bait easily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She wanted me to get to know her <em>senshi</em>.”  Her eyes wandered across the room’s luxuries, taking stock in the  heavy, plush curtains that lined wide banks of windows, colorful  tapestries depicting warrior women that hung from the stone walls, and  the gold and silver accented furniture, none of which the Martian had  seen the likes of before.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei didn’t care for any of it and her  first impression of their courtyard left a bad taste in her mouth.  Instead, she slowly advanced on Minako. ”So tell me, if being a senshi  is about kicking back and eating bon-bons all day, where do I sign up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  remained unaffected. “Bon-bons are too rich for the savage palate, I’m  afraid. I’m surprised you even have such a word in your vocabulary.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now, now. You don’t want to challenge me on words and languages again, do you Princess?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian smirked. “Touché.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  thought she said they hit it off?” Makoto’s whispered words to Ami  didn’t go unnoticed and the smirks that Minako and Rei wore evolved to  full fledged grins. The time for butting heads had passed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei,” Minako began, her hand reaching out to touch the Martian’s elbow, “These are my fellow senshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The petite blunette bowed slightly to the Martian. “Mercury Ami. Nice to meet you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jupiter Makoto.” The tall brunette stepped forward, offering the Martian a wide smile and her hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  she had with Minako, Rei stared at that hand, hesitant to shake it.  Things were happening all to fast for her, and although she didn’t want  to join these women, she didn’t want to get on their bad sides either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, she met the tall women’s strength with her own. “Rei.” She said simply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re  sorry we advanced on you earlier in the throne room,” The Jovian said,  an anxious hand rubbing the back of her neck before her hazel eyes  hardened. “but we had to make sure our Princess was safe.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We don’t expect you to understand, but… Serenity is our everything.” Ami said in a very quiet voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  smiled softly at her soldiers. In the Venusian’s cerulean eyes, Rei  could see that same devotion that the others had expressed. And  although she wanted to question that seemingly blind devotion, the  Martian quickly found that even given the short amount of time she’d  known the Princess of the Moon Kingdom, somehow, she could understand  how her senshi felt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian chuckled, a thought seeming to  catch her. “Even Ami-chan said it.” The others turned to her in  question. “Barbarians don’t understand much.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t mean it like that!” Ami exclaimed, hands splayed out in front of her and a blush on her cheeks.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess simply rolled her eyes. She’d let the Venusian take that  point on their running tally if it were so important to her. Besides,  she didn’t want to upset the fragile Mercurian, and the look the Jovian  was throwing in her direction for upsetting the petite woman didn’t go  unnoticed, either.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako released an overly dramatic sigh and  headed for the door. “Well, if you’ll excuse me, I have an audience  with the Princess shortly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Feeling violet eyes on her back, the  Venusian looked back to the Martian, and suddenly, the confident smirk  Minako wore slipped. Her lips parted, as though there were words on the  tip of her tongue, as though she didn’t want to leave the Martian’s  side, even for her Princess, but then her jaw shut with a click.  Turning, she only shut the door behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami’s nervous chuckle  made a desperate attempt to ease the tension. “I know she can be brash,  Rei-san, but Minako really is a great person.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess merely shrugged, her eyes still trained on the heavy, wooden door. Her voice was quiet when she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I need to get some air.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess let herself out of the room, careful to head in the direction opposite the one the moody Venusian had taken.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“I  don’t know, Minako-chan. She doesn’t seem like the type to like a good  prank.” Princes Serenity seemed cautious, biting her lower lip  anxiously.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian crossed her arms smugly. “I <em>know</em> she’s not the type to like a good prank. That’s why I want to do it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian reveled in her Princess’ excited giggles and when the door  swung open, revealing the devil herself, a smirk tugged at the corners  of her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My apologies.” The Martian barked. “I thought this room was vacant.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door the Priestess was too eager to shut stopped closing a hair’s  breadth from its home. “Yes?” The Martian growled her response, opening  the door only wide enough to meet the Venusian’s tempting gaze.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you do our Princess a favor?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What the hell does she think I am, a waitress? And that spoiled Serenity, dinner’s not even that far off!’ </span></em>The  Martian gritted her teeth against her anger as she followed Minako’s  directions to the palace kitchen. One marble lined hallway looked the  same as the next, but the sound of pots and pans clanging on hard  surfaces assured Rei that she was headed in the right direction and she  picked up her pace, eager to wash her hands of the mundane task Minako  had assigned her.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Entering the long, galley kitchen as noisily as possible was  difficult given her small shoes and quiet dress that didn’t clink and  clank with the comforting sounds of leather and metal, but Rei made due  by shouting into the busy room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve brought an order for the chef!” She declared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere  in the middle of the stainless steel clad room, an unattended pan of  oil sparked to life, erupting in flame, and all eyes turned to the  Martian Warrior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Heezabig Loozer!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian froze as  the words caught up to her and the name of a food that had sounded like  it was in a foreign language wasn’t so foreign at all. ‘<em>Minako… damnit!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">First  it was a snort. Then a lone chuckle. There was a wheezing gasp, and  then the entire room caught the bug and erupted into hysterics. All  except for one, large man boasting a white apron and a very tall hat  that was very quickly making his way towards the red cheeked Martian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Crap.” Rei muttered, and ran for it.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The shapes of four women that were squeezed together in a small side kitchen doorway suppressed their laughter.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That wasn’t a very kind thing to do.” Ami scolded, though the hand she held before her smile was telling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Serenity elbowed the leader of her guardians. “Especially to someone you <em>like</em>, Mina-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian choked on what had been wicked chuckle. “What!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto bent slightly to scold her leader with hazel eyes. “I think you’re trying a little <em>too</em> hard, Mina-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The golden haired warrior sighed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Crap.” She finally muttered, and took off in pursuit of the Martian.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  towering oak tree nestled in the back of a large, outdoor courtyard  behind the Palace was like an oasis in the desert, and beneath its  large limbs, Rei hoped to seek solace.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She sat at the tree’s base, sitting awkwardly in her foreign dress  that the Venusian had forced her into, yet she was content to draw on  the comfort of what little of the natural world she could find, the  natural world that she’d missed so dearly since being pulled into this  crazy world of people and politics, this crazy world of unpredictable,  confusing women.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Sea of Serenity stretched into oblivion and  the blue orb of the Earth was reflected in its rippling golden waters  that caught the light of the sun. Closing her eyes, she assured herself  that she’d found the solace she so desperately needed when her body  suddenly went rigid and stiff, her breath hitched in her throat, and  her vision faded to black before transforming into a nightmare scene  that was far beyond her control.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The basalt pavers of the  courtyard were torn and broken; the marble walls of the palace were  shattered and toppled. The tree which she had sought solace under was  charred and blackened. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>In the courtyard, amidst jagged  chunks of stone and upturned concrete, three warriors faced off against  too many youma, and in the courtyard’s center, one other warrior; a  golden soldier, faced off against a red haired woman. But it was the  force behind that woman, a shapeless, dark energy that towered over all.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The golden warrior charged her opponent, sword held high, and the red haired woman launched herself forward. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Rei  knew her body was shaking, but she couldn’t stop the tremors. For above  the din of battle, what frightened her the most was not a fear not of  death, but a fear of loss.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Rei! Rei!” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>And  then there was a warmth, a gentle sensation that somehow eased the fear  she’d felt, and her senses that had been captured by the nightmare  vision slowly released the fear she felt.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian’s amethyst eyes opened slowly and her body that had somehow  relaxed instinctually went rigid once more, for she found that her  fingers were twined in golden hair that could only belong to one  person, and sure enough, her nose was buried in the crook of Minako’s  neck. She was sure the Venusian was responsible for their embrace, but  was she to be held accountable for returning it while unaware of her  actions?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako held her tighter. “Rei, what was that?” Her voice was confused, desperate.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess pushed the slightly smaller woman away from her. “Don’t touch  me!” She snarled. There was a reason that she didn’t want anyone to  touch her while in the throes of a vision. But when the Venusian  seemingly wilted from that impulsive action, the Martian instantly  regretted her words.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako reeled, not understanding the  emotions and imagery she’d experienced by touching the other woman, but  she vaguely remembered that she did in fact, have a purpose for  tracking Rei down. It was the only thing she could cling to given what  she’d seen and felt, and given the Priestess’ vehement rejection of  her. She turned, tearing her gaze from the wild eyed woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  sorry.” She nearly barked her apology as she pushed herself to her  feet. “I’m sorry for teasing you earlier, and I’m sorry for disturbing  you now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei stumbled to her feet and managed to grab Minako  none too gently by the wrist before she fled. “No, wait!” She barked,  somehow relieved when the Venusian paused.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stay.” She repeated distantly, as though she hadn’t been aware that she would even make the request at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two women sank back down to the ground, leaning their backs to the  rough bark of the massive oak. An awkward silence settled between them,  and the Martian found herself doubting the soundness of her impulsive  decision after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’ve planned to head to Jupiter.” Minako  said quietly, making conversation her duty in order to fill the  uncomfortable void between them. “Ami-chan, Mako-chan and I.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We’re going to the pole. We think we may find more clues there the way we did on Mars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian sighed angrily and scooted to the side, forcing the Martian to  look at her. Rei found herself relieved to see that glimmer of  aggravation back in those cerulean eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We could use your help, Rei. The four of us together will have a better chance for success, don’t you think?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Together. There’s that word again.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Will you come with us?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Be one of my senshi, Rei-chan.” </em>Princess  Serenity’s voice echoed in Rei’s ears, and she had to ask herself; if  she were to go, whom would she be going for? Serenity or Minako? The  Princess or the warrior?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She found the answer easier to come by than she expected, and she leveled her confident gaze on Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  answer seemed to appease the Venusian and the golden haired woman  nodded and leaned back into the tree once more. This time, the silence  between them wasn’t so awkward. And when Minako reached out and covered  Rei’s hand gently with her own, she wasn’t quite so surprised when the  Priestess didn’t draw away from her gentle touch.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I know this chapter was a little slow, but now the plot’s been set.  Expect much more action in the next chapter. You know, all kinds of  action. wicked chuckle Okay, I guess that was mean of me.</span></p>

<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 3: On Jupiter, Part One: Man Overboard</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  only been unconscious for a moment, but she’d faded in and out of  darkness since. She’d been vaguely aware of Minako shouting commands in  a stressed tone. She’d been pretty certain it was Makoto who had picked  her up and carried her into one of the two tents she’d set up, and  she’d been fairly sure she’d seen Ami’s small form darting around the  tent’s small footprint, laying out a bedroll and arranging supplies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Rei wasn’t fully aware of her surroundings until the only thing she  could hear was the howling winds and the rain as it drove against the  tent’s walls, and the only person left in front of her was Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take your clothes off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Rei’s already shaky legs threatened to give out beneath her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re soaked and you need to dry off. Now don’t make me repeat myself or I’ll do it <em>for</em> you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  couldn’t tell if the Priestess’ hesitation was borne from her  exhaustion or something else, but finally, Rei began to strip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she was so very weak, and her arms were getting stuck in the clinging,  wet material of her shirt. And so, she took the situation into her own  hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t make you repeat yourself!” The Martian snapped as she felt Minako’s hands take the hem of her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry. I won’t take advantage of you.” The Venusian said, her tone light and teasing. “Not unless you <em>want</em> me to, that is.”</span></p>
