Minako was in her bedroom with her eyes watching the emptiness. The 
radio  was babbling in the background, and it was making her feeling 
numb...almost  sleepy. She was thinking about her encounter with 
Setsuna, her sweet smile,  her soothing words, her sensual silence...  

&#39;she&#39;s got to be so terribly good looking too, just to torture me...&#39;  
were the last words she thought before leaving the tangible world,  
falling into the land of dreams, while wondering which one of the 
worlds was the real one anyways.  

&quot;and though you hold the Keys to ruin 
Of everything I see 
With every prison blown to dust, 
My enemies walk free 
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand 
And fall into the sea 
I&#39;m mad about you... 
I&#39;m mad about you.&quot;  

She woke up in the middle of the dark with the radio on. The night 
felt  so incredibly long, Minako took a glance on her clock and it&#39;s 
hands where  in the same place than when she felt asleep. She felt her 
body rested, as  she would have slept for hours.   

Something was wrong.  

------------------------------------------------------------

The bluish light of the computer screen was blinking reflections over 
the  wall. Mizuno Ami was asleep over the keyboard and her body was 
showing  signals of a restless dream. She was walking along the shore 
on a beautiful  afternoon. Makoto was by her side, holding her hand. 

&#39;sweet Mako-chan...&#39;  

The tall girl pointed to the horizon and Amy watched the sun setting 
on the  fine line drew by the sea. Suddenly her hand felt empty, cold, 
and Makoto  wasn&#39;t by her side anymore. The water under her feet was 
completely black. 

The ringing of the phone took her out of the dream, and with a 
trembling hand she picked it up. &quot;..he-llo..?&quot; 

&quot;Hello Ami, it&#39;s Michiru, sorry to wake you up so late, but I needed 
to talk to you about something extremely serious.&quot; 

&quot;...umm, oh, yes, don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s alright, I was in the computer 
anyways. What do you want to talk about, Michiru?&quot; 

&quot;Well...I cannot talk about this by phone, I would prefer to discuss 
this  in person. Haruka will pick you up in an hour, we are staying at 
the beach house this weekend.&quot; 

&quot;I see it&#39;s urgent...I&#39;ll be ready...anything you want to tell me in 
advance?&quot; Amy was intrigued about this urgency, although she was 
felling still numb from her unwanted nap on the desk chair. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami...I guess that the only thing I can say is that the 
water is involved, and you know is our element, and I&#39;m feeling a 
disturbance that I cannot comprehend, so I need your help to figure 
this up.&quot; 

&quot;...I understand Michiru, I&#39;ll bring my computer...I feel that too.&quot; 

&quot;I imagined you would understand. I&#39;ll see you in a while Ami, thanks 
for your understanding.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome...&quot; and the tone of the line suddenly woke her up 
completely from her numbness, making the phone fall from her fingers, 
and over  the desk. 

&#39;I&#39;ll better get ready...&#39; and, for some reason, all the trip with 
Haruka to the coast, she couldn&#39;t stop thinking about Makoto.  

------------------------------------------------------------

The beach house was built in a beautiful isolated place beside the 
ocean, and Michiru was standing on a small cliff, watching the big 
water mass under the clear sky. Haruka and Ami walked towards her in 
silence, and their steps got lost in the sound of the water splashing 
against the rocks. 

&quot;Is still there, love?&quot; 

Haruka put a protective arm around her shoulders,  and Michiru looked 
at her and Ami, and answered &quot;it&#39;s growing bigger...&quot; 

Ami followed Michiru&#39;s intrigued gaze, and found a spot in the ocean, 
exactly in front of the cliff, where the water had turned completely 
black. The light  of the full moon, let them see the phenomenon, 
though it wasn&#39;t too clear due to the darkness of the night. Michiru 
held a potent industrial flashlight in her hand, and turned it on. 

&quot;Look&quot; 

The colorless dot on the water, was slowly craddled by the strength of 
the tide, but, besides that motion, it stayed in the same place.  

&quot;It&#39;s probably not related to this...but I had a vivid dream today...&quot; 
Amy  said with a shy soft voice. Michiru looked at her with a worried 
expression. &quot;The water was turning black...and I was with...well...it 
doesn&#39;t matter, but I had a strong feeling of danger coming from it&quot;, 
Ami looked at the strange dot on the water, and the smile of Makoto 
invaded her thoughts. 

&quot;I dreamed about that too, Ami, I think this is very serious, and we 
have  to figure it out, before something bad happens.&quot; 

&quot;Do you think this might be coming from the Negaverse, Michiru?&quot; 

&quot;wherever it&#39;s coming from...it&#39;s sure not from here&quot;. And with these 
words they started to climb down closer to their point of interest.  

------------------------------------------------------------

Setsuna was in her room, with one of her physics books in her hands. 
The silence in the house was intruding, interrupted by the noises of 
the  night, and the music of the wind, blowing careless outside the 
window. Hotaru was spending the weekend with Chibi-Usa, Haruka and 
Michiru were on the beach house, and the lonely young woman was lost 
in her solitude, unable to concentrate on her doctorate researchs. 
Victim of her own composure, she was unable to express her feelings 
for Minako, and she doubted the blonde girl would feel anything but 
frienship for her, and the thought of being without her company was 
making her miserable. 

&#39;At least she liked to spend time with me before&#39;, but lately the  
visits to her house stopped, and she didn&#39;t dare to call her to ask 
her why. &#39;I wonder what happened to her today...&#39; she thought, and  
remembered she used to be so cheerful and talkative almost all the 
time, never feeling uncomfortable or threatened by her formality 
(probably knowing that this was just in the surface, a consequence of 
the weight of her duty guarding the Gates of Time). &#39;She didn&#39;t say 
much... she looked so sad...is probably about a boy. She&#39;s a beautiful 
woman. I wonder who could dare break her heart in that way.&#39; 

The book fell  without a sound on her bed, and she closed her eyes 
trying to comunicate with her visions of the future one more time.  

Nothing. 

When she was starting to realize about her lack of abilities to handle 
the Gates of Time anymore, Haruka popped into her mind like a computer 
comercial in the middle of a boring midnight show. 

&quot;We need you at the beach house Setsuna.&quot; 

And she run to her car, and left towards the coast, unsure of the 
reality of her last vision.  

------------------------------------------------------------

Michiru, Haruka, Makoto, Minako, Usagi and Rei were around the table 
listening to Ami&#39;s hypothesis. She stopped for a moment, distracted by 
the noise of Setsuna&#39;s car engine out of the cottage, and took a sip 
of her hot tea, waiting for the outer senshi to join the group. 

Michiru opened the door, inviting her to come in, showing with a 
gesture of her arm the girls by the table, interrupting her with a 
soft &quot;it&#39;s alright&quot; knowing in that expression a glimpse of apologies 
for appearing in the place without even a phone call. 

Minako&#39;s heart was pounding with anxiety, and her eyes inmediatly 
looked at the table when they met Setsuna&#39;s burning gaze; &#39;...and I&#39;m 
supossed to be the goddess of love...&#39; she thought while grabbing a 
cup of tea,  just to distract her body to betray her with a give away 
move. 

After explaining Setsuna the reason for their meeting, Ami continued 
&quot;I took a sample of the black water. The chemical composition shows a 
mixture that was comparable to the one the earth had in the origins of 
life. Is not affected by the order of the molecules of the rest of the 
ocean, apparently is protected by a magnetic field that isolates it 
completely, but I cannot find the source where it comes from.&quot; 

The whole group was with their eyes in Ami, except for Minako, that 
was staring at the bottom of her teacup, while looking at Setsuna&#39;s  
direction with her peripheral vision. 

&quot;I couldn&#39;t take more than one sample, but there&#39;s an organism that is 
rapidly growing inside, that had the shape of an unicellular  lifeform 
at the beginning, but is turning to different forms by the second, 
something that took millions of years to nature when it comes to 
evolution&quot;. 

Michiru moved uncomfortable on her chair and added &quot;That&#39;s why we are 
here. The sea is being used as a living laboratory, a giant test tube 
where something is growing with unknown purposes; the isolation and 
the darkness seem to have the hand writing of the Negaverse all over 
it.&quot; 

Rei was sitting beside Usagi, anxious to go back to the moment where 
they were interrupted at the shrine. &quot;Why don&#39;t we just go and do  
something now, before it gets worst, out of hand, and stop the process 
when is still posible?&quot; 

In that moment, Setsuna, that was standing with her back against a 
wall, in the shadow, said softly &quot;Because for some reason, I lost 
control of the Gates of Time, and if we do anything now,  it will 
repeat itself again and again, until the process is completed.&quot; 

Haruka looked puzzled after her comment &quot;...but you received my 
message, you have some perception left.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s the only thing I could receive in my mind today, I feel 
without doubt that we&#39;re going to have to wait, and I&#39;ll have control 
of Time again when is done.&quot; 

Although the light over the table couldn&#39;t reach above her neck, 
Minako could see the sadness in her face. &quot;I&#39;ll go for a walk to see 
what&#39;s going on outside.&quot; 

Without  saying another word, Minako stormed outside, trying to escape 
from her feelings, completely blinded by her thoughts.  

Inside the black pool of water, a creature evolved in thousand forms 
with a frightening speed, keeping in its body the organs that would 
make it suitable for surviving in water, land and air. It was growing 
in size and rage, provoked by the pain of the rate of the unnatural 
evolution. 

Suddenly the invisible jail that was keeping the creature inside 
disappeared, and it flew out of the water looking for a victim. It had 
gills and lungs, four feline-like legs that ended up in sharp claws, 
wings on the back that would make a boing 747 look like a  sparrow 
beside them, and a T-rex like head that was covered by a thick 
protective reptile skin as the rest of its body.  

It was still clumsy when it hit her. Minako was lucky, even though 
unconcious over the cold sand, after the creature rolled over her in 
his thirst for revenge against something he couldn&#39;t comprehend.  

All the senshis were inside, watching in horror the scene outside, and 
invoked their powers, while a desperate Setsuna ran to rescue the 
inmovile delicate body out of danger. Haruka shook the earth with her 
attack, but that only called the attention of the creature, that 
charged blindely against the outer senshi, pushing her over the  
cliff, leaving Neptune paralized, after seing her partner disappear in 
the water. Jupiter hurted him with her thunder, but after rolling 
heavily over the sand, it turn and hit her with it&#39;s tail, throwing 
the body of the tallest girl away from Mercury and over the grass, 
where Rei was concentrating  her fire attack towards it&#39;s head. The 
water senshi hit him with her ice blast, leaving the creature confused 
and slow, and Sailor Moon finished him with a move of her moon 
scepter, distroying it&#39;s molecular composition. The thing  disappear 
in the air like a vanishing quimera. 

Neptune was on the  shore, with an unconcious Uranus in her arms. 
Jupiter was bleeding profusely from her neck and left shoulder, and 
was walking blindly, dazzled by her growing pain. The beach cottage 
looked like an improvised infirmary, the injured girls lying on the 
beds, while the other were running around,  bringing water and gauzes 
without saying a word. 

Minako opened her eyes, and found Setsuna sitting by her side holding 
a pack of ice against her head, close to her right ear, where the 
creature had opened a superficial wound not to long ago. She sat on 
the bed and a sharp pain crossed her forehead. 

&quot;You should stay still for a while, even though is not severe, you 
were unconcious for almost an hour.&quot; Her voice was soft, and her eyes 
tired and watery. 

&#39;She&#39;s been crying&#39; The thought made the blond girl sad for a moment, 
but  in the back of her mind a light of hope shyly started to shine. 
Michiru was in the other room taking care of Haruka, and both of them 
had a look of complicity in their faces, the kind that only  lovers 
have, knowing what the other one is thinking. They were  facing Ami, 
taking care of Makoto&#39;s wounds. They were both  blushing, and 
Mako-chan was staring at Ami with a glare of love  in her eyes. 

&quot;Do you see what I see?&quot; Haruka whispered to her lover. 

&quot;Yes I do, but you should try to rest instead of playing the  
matchmaker, my love&quot;.  </pre>
