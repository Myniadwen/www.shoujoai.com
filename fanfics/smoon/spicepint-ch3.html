Mina and I finished the project before early morning. The blond was so 
proud of the song that she sung it repeatedly throughout the night, even 
while she slept! Pretty amazing, some people sleep walk but she sings in 
her sleep. As much as I loved to experience one the goddess of love&#39;s 
talents there was a limit on how much sleep abuse my body could take. No 
sleep was definitely out of the question. Eventually to keep myself from 
strangling the girl I took a chance and snuck out, making my way back to 
the shrine.

It was still early in the morning, judging from the sun&#39;s position I&#39;d 
say five a.m. at best. As soon as I returned home I quick changed into 
my miko attire and walked back outside to practice my archery. Although 
we had an indoor training ground for the particular sport I decided not 
to risk disturbing grandpa&#39;s sleep. Lately he&#39;s been getting weaker and 
weaker... an old man such as himself really needs all the sleep he can 
get. You know when grandpa is sick when he doesn&#39;t have the energy to 
hit on the visitors.

In deep thought I walked into a grove of dormant sakura trees on my way 
to the destination. The scene looked very similar to yesterday&#39;s memory, 
except for the absence of the white petals. I found myself stopping to 
eye one of the trees to my right. My eyes zoned in onto one of the small 
branches and there they were... budding blossoms barely visible to the 
naked eye in the process of blooming...Beginning of April, end of March, 
the flowers were on time. Rarely were they ever late.

Up to a day ago I&#39;d wait every year with anticipation for the flower 
show, but a certain memory drove away the desire from my heart. Feeling 
depression attempt to cloud my mind I shook my head and continued on my 
journey. My fists tightened together.

Soon I reached a clearing. After a few quick glances my analysis was 
complete. Everything was still set up in their proper places...exactly 
where I left it.

Moments later with a bow clutched securely with my left hand I stood at 
a distance, allowing my amethyst eyes to stare the target down with a 
ferocious but calm intensity. In one slow, smooth motion I had brought 
my bow up to my front, shoulder height extended. Simultaneously my right 
arm withdrew an arrow from the pack attached to my back, bringing it up 
and then horizontally into the high strung thread. Never letting my eyes 
off the target I adjusted my finger pressure on the arrow. Everything 
had to be perfect, one detail off and the shot would be ruined. 
Automatically my body initiated the rhythm of deep inhales and slow 
exhales, clearing my mind of any fog that inhabited it lately.

Preparations complete...Just then a swift wind shot through the 
clearing, sending my raven locks spiraling in all direction. It was at 
that moment I released my hold.

Tsing. To my disappointment the arrow was slightly off; the wind had 
carried it to the left. It had landed in the blue, two zones away from 
the bullseye. Not bad for a shot but could&#39;ve been better.

A few more attempts and I had finally hit the center. I huffed mouthfuls 
of air in a ragged fashion...suppose this was normal side effect to 
exercising after being ill.

Next I retrieved the arrows and then rotated the target thirty degrees 
right from its center. If you were serious about something you had to 
make sure all of the angles were covered. In life most often 
opportunities don&#39;t come all perfectly packaged... sometimes you had to 
adjust to make them work.

Bring the bow up, withdraw an arrow, cock the arrow beside my right ear, 
adjust finger pressure, take deep inhales and exhales and...real-

&quot;REEEEI CHAN!&quot;

Too soon!

&quot;Ah!&quot;

I felt myself gasp as my fingers released the stored potential energy, 
sending the arrow flying past the target and into a tree behind it. 
Twack.

What...the...I twitched in irritation. Only one person could own that 
loud voice...

Minako&#39;s POV

&quot;Ohayo Rei chan!&quot;

She stood there with her back facing me, not moving.

&quot;Ah, you know Rei chan, that shot wasn&#39;t very good, nope! It was waaaay 
off!&quot; I lifted a hand similar to a salute position and turned my head 
side to side in a mock search. &quot;It landed...way behind the target ne?&quot;

&quot;Mina chan...&quot; She growled back.

I didn&#39;t notice it before but the senshi of fire was shaking slightly. 
Maybe she&#39;s cold? Kind of odd since she is wearing her miko outfit...but 
perhaps she&#39;s sensitive to the early morning chills?

&quot;Aww, maybe Rei chan needs a hug.&quot; I whispered to myself, stifling a 
giggle with my hands.

The raven haired goddess whipped around just as I flung myself towards 
her.

&quot;Mina y-.&#39; Her eyes widened, shocking paralyzing her body movement.

Whomp.

&quot;Ahaha, thought you could use a hug Rei chan.&quot;

We were both sprawled on the ground, my arms wrapped loosely around her 
neck. It was a shame that I couldn&#39;t see her facial expression...her 
bangs shielded her eyes from my curious gaze. Is she awake? Kami, I hope 
the collision didn&#39;t knock her out.

I pressed my head to her chest, listening intently for her heart beat. 
It was fast. So fast that it threatened to beat through hers and into 
mine! But... doesn&#39;t your heart beat drop if you fall unconscious?

Rei&#39;s arm rose off the ground. They curled around our forms, hovering 
slightly over the both of us. If she wanted to, she could have embraced 
me in one action. It was my heart&#39;s turn to be pounding, everything was 
overwhelming me in a way I never knew. The warmth of our two 
bodies...the possibility of Rei embracing me...my arms tightened their 
hold around her neck.

Rei&#39;s arms closed the distance but at the last second they stopped and 
patted my back.

&quot;I&#39;m all right Mina chan.&quot; She sighed. &quot;You can...&quot;

&quot;Ah! Gomen ne Rei chan.&quot; I pushed myself away from her and stood up. 
&quot;I-I didn&#39;t mean...you sure you&#39;re all right?&quot;

&quot;Hai, hai.&quot; She sighed.

My heart had slowed down for the time being...that was...until Rei 
brushed back her bangs and stared at me with those captivating amethyst 
eyes of hers.

&quot;Er...&quot;

&quot;What brings you this early in the morning Mina chan?&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s not exactly that early anymore...&quot;

She raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Just how long were you watching?&quot;

&quot;Tsk, don&#39;t tell me the great Rei let her guard down.&quot; Now she was 
glaring at me, blood rushing to her face. &quot;Aww, you look so cute like 
that Rei chan.&quot;

&quot;I...don&#39;t do kawaii.&quot; She huffed.

She looked away slightly, seeing her like that took everything I had to 
stop myself from pinching those cheeks. Knowing her she might start 
using me as the target if I did.

&quot;Since you tried to sneek out Rei chan.&quot; I changed the subject. &quot;You 
weren&#39;t very good at it you know? Hell, I was surprised my mother didn&#39;t 
wake up after you tripped and banged your head against the wall.&quot;

It was also hard to believe that I managed to keep my laughter in at the 
time as well, but I don&#39;t think Rei needs to know that.

&quot;So...&quot; She coughed. Always does that when she wants to lessen her 
embarrassment I noted. &quot;Since I tried to leave?&quot;

&quot;Hai.&quot; I felt myself nod. &quot;Why did you leave Rei chan?&quot;

&quot;Ano...&quot;

&quot;Oh, would you like me to sing again? I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll cheer you up!&quot;

&quot;Ile!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a bad singer?&quot; Her outburst hurt me a little.

Seeing my hurt expression Rei quickly tried to correct herself.

&quot;It...It&#39;s not that at all Mina chan! I mean...oh, I have a bit of a 
headache, I&#39;m sensitive to loud sounds right now.&quot;

&quot;My...voice is a loud sound?&quot; This time I tried to make her feel guilty, 
aha, sometimes I can be so evil. Although the false tears came streaming 
from my eyes I was actually grinning inside.

&quot;I-ile-I mean...&quot; She took a deep breath and frowned. &quot;That&#39;s not it 
Mina chan.&quot; Her arms stretched out indecisively towards me.

&quot;Then what do you mean?&quot;

My back turned to face her now as I crossed my arms. I had expected 
another verbal excuse only to receive a small surprise. Rei gently 
wrapped her arms around me gently, holding us close together. Oh...

My arms dropped to their sides. We were the same height, perhaps I was a 
bit taller but it wasn&#39;t noticeable. What was...was the feeling of her 
breathing on my neck. It sent shivers down my body.

&quot;Gomen ne, Mina chan. I didn&#39;t mean to hurt your feelings...&quot;

&quot;R-Rei chan...&quot; I broke away from her embrace without thinking, meeting 
the slightly cool air once more. &quot;It&#39;s all right. I&#39;m fine, don&#39;t worry 
about it.&quot;

There was still some doubt in her eyes.

&quot;Actually Rei chan, I received a phone call from Ami chan yesterday. 
Usagi is coming back for a visit.&quot;

&quot;U...Usagi?&quot;

&quot;Hai...&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you say anything earlier!&quot; Wow, mood changer.

&quot;You were asleep Rei chan...everyone knows how cranky you can be if you 
are disturbed from your beauty sleep.&quot;

&quot;That didn&#39;t stop you from singing did it?&quot; She snapped back.

&quot;Well, excuse me. I thought it could&#39;ve been like a lullaby.&quot; I 
responded coolly.

&quot;Gah...never mind.&quot;

&quot;We should go Rei chan. Ami chan and Makoto chan want to go for a girl&#39;s 
night out and do some karaoke. Usagi loves that sort of stuff remember?&quot;

Rei nodded her head finally.

&quot;All right...Let me go change and we&#39;ll get going. That all right Mina 
chan?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, no problem.&quot;

I moved to follow after Rei when she ran out of the clearing, but 
stopped for a moment and looked at back her target.

Rei chan...love is like a target, did you know? There are many sides to 
a person that you need to get to know before you can really say you know 
them. Love isn&#39;t about seeing and loving one part of someone...it&#39;s to 
love his or her soul as a whole.

&quot;I...I want to know all of you.&quot; I whispered quietly.

Outside the crown arcade, Minako&#39;s POV still

&quot;You took forever Rei chan!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not my fault that we missed the bus, if you haven&#39;t stopped to 
check out that crowd of guys...&quot;

&quot;You were staring too!&quot;

&quot;Was not!&quot;

&quot;Was too!&quot;

&quot;WAS NOT!&quot;

&quot;WAS TOO!&quot;

We both stared at each other, hardly aware that our faces were inches 
apart. After a few seconds Rei&#39;s stance faltered slightly. Was she 
blushing?

&quot;Mina chan! Rei chan!&quot;

I almost jumped. Turning towards the voice, it&#39;s owner, a blue haired 
girl and her brunette companion were making their way towards us.

&quot;Ami chan!&quot; I yelled back.

&quot;Makoto chan!&quot; Rei shouted too.

&quot;It&#39;s good to see you guys again.&quot; The brunette nodded her head at us. 
Her emerald eyes didn&#39;t seem to have that cold intensity they used to 
have before...maybe Ami changed her more than we thought.

&quot;I haven&#39;t seen you forever!&quot; I gave Amy a quick hug while Rei and 
Makoto shook hands. So typical of those two.

&quot;I know.&quot; Amy&#39;s blue eyes looked a bit sad at the mention but they 
quickly brightened up. &quot;Anyway, Usagi said she&#39;d meet us here...&quot;

&quot;We aren&#39;t going to pick her up at the airport?&quot; Rei asked, surprise 
evident on her face.

&quot;She insisted she could get over here by herself.&quot; Makoto chipped in.

We all sighed. Knowing our leader, she&#39;d be the last one here and late.

&quot;Well...we might as well go inside and sit down or something. The first 
thing she&#39;d probably do is ask where all the food is.&quot; Rei started.

&quot;Good idea.&quot; I agreed with her. &quot;What do you two say?&quot; Amy and Makoto 
smiled and nodded.

The place hadn&#39;t changed very much, with exception to the karaoke 
addition. Amy had planned everything out so perfectly. The reservations 
were in order, the booth was all set up and everything was already paid 
for! That&#39;s our genius for you. Rei and I sat in one half of the booth 
while Amy and Makoto sat across from us.

Time ticked by. An hour had passed and all the food was ordered and had 
been served.

&quot;Where...is...&quot; Rei was on the edge from screaming her impatience.

&quot;GUUUUUUYS!&quot;

We all turned towards the high pitched shrill. A blond woman stormed in 
through the entrance of the arcade, her hair tied in a unique style of 
pigtails.

&quot;Hey Usagi.&quot; Makoto was the first to greet the panting blond.

&quot;Yeah, nice to meet you too but can I borrow some money?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Everyone sweat dropped.

&quot;You see...&quot; Usagi twiddled her thumbs. &quot;I kind of got...lost. 
And-I-used-a-taxi-but-we-kept-missing-this-place-and-I-need-some-cash- 
and-I-promise-to-pay-you-all-back-later!&quot; She sped talked the last line. 
It was difficult to hear what she actually said.

We all sighed once more, even grown up she still hadn&#39;t changed from 
that klutzy teen she was back then. Everyone chipped in and then watched 
our &#39;leader&#39; run back to a very impatient taxi driver. So much for a 
flawless meeting.

&quot;So...I, it&#39;s good to see you all again. I really am sorry about 
that...&quot; She apologized while taking a seat next to Rei and me. To sit 
next to Rei, big mistake.

&quot;You&#39;re always late Usagi!&quot; Rei snapped. &quot;If you swallowed your pride 
and let us pick you up from the airport none of this would&#39;ve happened!&quot;

&quot;R-Rei chan...&quot;

&quot;I swear! You never listen to us!&quot;

&quot;W-why hy are you still mean to meeeee...?&quot; The blond started to get 
teary eyed.

&quot;Rei chan...&quot; Amy interrupted. Rei couldn&#39;t say &#39;no&#39; if it came from 
Amy.

&quot;Well it&#39;s true!&quot; Rei huffed.

&quot;Listen, maybe we should just enjoy this. The food is all ordered...so 
let&#39;s eat a bit and then sing. What do you guys say?&quot;

Rei glared quickly at Usaig before saying,

&quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;Wow Makoto, that&#39;s a great idea!&quot; I had to remark. &quot;I guess spending 
all that time with Amy rubbed off on you huh?&quot;

Both Amy and Makoto blushed crimson red. However their embarrassing 
moment passed with an,

&quot;Let&#39;s P-A-R-T-Y!&quot; Scream from Usagi.

Everyone picked up their glasses and we all tapped them with each other 
in the middle before drinking.

It was just like the old days...When we were all together, fighting as 
sailor senshi and saving the world. The crown was our old hang aside 
from the Hikawa Shrine. I missed the sound of our laughter, the 
completeness from us being as a group...For one moment we were all those 
crazy, reckless teenagers again. Well, except Usagi, she hasn&#39;t changed 
at all.

&quot;I&#39;m up for some singing!&quot; Usagi chimed all of the sudden. Normally 
she&#39;d be the last one to finish eating.

&quot;Y-you sure that&#39;s a good idea Usagi chan?&quot; Amy asked, she looked 
worried. &quot;I mean, you did drink a bit too much...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine!&quot;

With that, before any of us could say another world, a mike found its 
way into her hands and she started a number. It was an odd sight to see. 
Usagi swung side to side slightly, trying to look serious and was 
failing it bad.

&quot;Iiiiiiii miiiiissssS YooouuUuu.&quot;

Wow, she was pretty bad. I glanced over at Rei, who had her ears 
covered. Amy and Makoto were giggling every once in a while and I...I 
just keep watching Rei. Her expression continually amazed me, the way 
she tried to block out all sound but tried to listen at the same time.

The song went on forever...okay, a whole five minutes. Usagi might&#39;ve 
gone for a round two if Makoto hadn&#39;t dragged her off the stage.

&quot;NooOoOo!&quot;

&quot;Sorry Usagi, we all won&#39;t survive another one of your songs!&quot; Makoto 
grunted, dragging the smaller girl across the floor back to our table. 
&quot;Hey, let go of the mike!&quot;

Amy and I helped pry the instrument from the blond&#39;s hands. I can&#39;t 
believe it took two of us!

&quot;So...who&#39;s next?&quot; Makoto asked, panting slightly still.

&quot;Well we all should get a chance to go...so why not you or Amy?&quot;

Amy and Makoto looked at each other.

&quot;You can go first Amy chan.&quot;

Amy nodded shyly. Her number was &#39;Onaji Namida wo Wakeatte&#39; and she was 
really good! Wow, you know, she should sing more.

&quot;Koraekirezu koboreta namida (Not able to endure it longer, my tears 
flowed,)/ Kotoba mo misukaranai mama (And I still can&#39;t find the 
words...)&quot;

Makoto went next. It was another sweet surprise to us all. She chose to 
sing &#39;Starlight ni Kiss Shite&#39;.

&quot;Kokoro no katasumi fui ni anata ga arawarete (Suddenly you appear 
within the corner of my heart)/ Watashi tachidomaraseru no ( I have to 
stop and stand still).&quot;

It was beautiful...if I didn&#39;t know better I&#39;d say Amy and Makoto sang 
those two songs for each other.

&quot;Rei chan, do you want to go next?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know Mina chan.&quot; She mumbled.

&quot;You aren&#39;t scared are you?&quot;

I expected a snap or an outburst of anger but instead Rei muttered,

&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot;

Frankly I was taken aback. Rei is hardly ever like this. What&#39;s wrong 
with you Rei?

Rei POV

I sighed once more, looking into my drink. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m not happy 
to be with everyone or anything like that...It just feels so weird. 
Usagi is back for a bit...I still can&#39;t get over how we all used to 
fight and protect her with our lives. Almost like a dream that comes and 
goes. It really ashamed me to think like this but...does a person really 
need friend&#39;s to be human? Where would I be without my friend&#39;s? Where 
would they be without me? Better off?

I glanced over to see Mina staring at me, giving me a concerned look.

&quot;Rei chan, do you want to go next?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know Mina chan.&quot; I mumbled.

&quot;You aren&#39;t scared are you?&quot;

Normally it&#39;s true that I&#39;d get swayed into a fiery temper and accept 
her challenge, but... I&#39;m not really in the mood for this.

&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot; I finally muttered.

&quot;Rei chan...&quot;

&quot;Hmm...?&quot;

&quot;Sing with me!&quot;

&quot;NANI!&quot; I found myself yelling, eyes wide.

&quot;Let&#39;s sing the song we did!&quot;

&quot;Are you nuts?&quot;

&quot;Hey, you guys did a song?&quot; Makoto asked interested.

&quot;Yeah...&quot; I weakly replied.

&quot;That&#39;s great, it would be nice to hear it.&quot; Amy encouraged us.

Usagi&#39;s opinion didn&#39;t count, she was practically knocked out.

&quot;It&#39;ll be fun Rei chan!&quot; Mina continued to try and convince me.

Before I could protest any further Mina dragged me onto the stage and 
forced a mike into my sweaty palms. Great, I&#39;m beside a girl that I like 
and it&#39;s...really hot in here. Damn lights.

&quot;You remember how it goes right?&quot; Mina asked me.

&quot;I&#39;ve heard it enough.&quot; I was really trying to surpress the sarcasm but 
failed.

We didn&#39;t need music in the background, a lot of the time we used out 
own voices to fill in the sounds in the gaps. It was so sweet, I got 
caught up in it before I could say &#39;Usagi is a baka&#39;.

&quot;Don&#39;t let go...&quot;

Halfway through though Mina hit me with a surprise.

Vividly I remember her stepping closer...and then...

&quot;Don-&quot; Gah! I screamed in my mind.

Mina had grabbed my arm and flung me across the stage, spinning in mid 
air. Luckily I had landed on my feet. Trying to maintain my composure I 
continued singing, hoping my surprise wasn&#39;t obvious.

When I glanced back in her direction I noticed her release a small 
giggle. So that&#39;s&#39; how she want to play huh? I worked my way back 
towards her slowly, showing off a few dance steps along the way. All the 
while she remained planted on a spot and did a few twirls as well. Come 
on, I can do it, blend in...Cross, leg behind...There!

After one last twirl I stood looking at her and smirked. If she thinks 
she could throw me off, well, I&#39;ll just have to show her. She&#39;s going to 
be the one to be sent flying in a second!

&quot;Heh...&quot;

Mina watched me for a moment and then smiled. Why is she smiling? I 
frowned slightly. Doesn&#39;t she know that...

Her hand caught my gaze, it was outstretched, waiting for me to take. I 
glanced up at her eyes suspiciously, the playful look in those cerulean 
orbs were not a good sign.

&quot;Want...?&quot; She started to whisper.

Unknown to us, a man in a black suit was paying close attention to our 
act. His shades hid his intent while he swirled an orange drink in a 
small drinking glass.

All sound drowned out while I continued to stare at the inviting hand. 
Want to what? What was she going to say?

Before I could think my mind started to remember again...the action 
reminded me of something from long ago.

It was in a ballroom...there were so many people dressed elegantly as 
peacocks in their gowns and tuxes. Princesses gave a small curtsy to 
their princes and they danced.

I stood in a corner of the grand room, dressed in a fancy red dress. My 
mind was reeling from the realistic setting. Marble floor, marble 
walls...I could feel the warmth in the room, heck, I could even feel the 
breeze that the dancers created from their movements. Even the dress 
felt somewhat itchy. I noticed the energetic beat playing in the 
background die out and was replaced by a piano and violin accompaniment.

Tenou Haruka and Kaioh Michiru had taken the music stage. Senshi of the 
wind and senshi of the ocean, performing a violin piece with a piano 
accompaniment. I must admit, it was the first time I saw them in my 
memories...the regular ones usually only included Venus and Mars 
interaction. Like the sakura one...An image of the couple kissing 
flashed through my head. Too...much...interaction, I blushed.

If the two outer senshi were here than that could mean the others were 
here as well. In moments I had spotted Amy and Makoto sharing a dance. 
Cute, even back then they were a couple. Usagi was switching dance 
partners by the dance, guess she really likes to enjoy herself. I 
continued to scan through the couples but someone was missing. Where&#39;s 
Venus? Actually I&#39;d like to know where Mars is as well...Both of them 
aren&#39;t here! Gulp, don&#39;t tell me they&#39;re...

&quot;There you are! I was looking all over for you.&quot;

A familiar long, haired blond made her way towards me. Kami! Where&#39;s 
Mars? She&#39;s was definitely not beside me, being behind me would be 
impossible since I&#39;m pressed up against a wall.

&quot;Rei chan, why are you all by yourself in the corner?&quot;

Her hand was reaching out to me. My mind froze, this wasn&#39;t supposed to 
happen, it never did before. I was always the witness, these were 
memories, this isn&#39;t supposed to happen! I repeated in my mind. I 
gulped. Unconsciously I felt my sweaty palms against the back wall...my 
heart raced as Venus&#39;s hand continued to close the distance between us.

It was a both a relief and a surprise when she stopped.

&quot;Want...to dance?&quot;

&quot;Dance...?&quot;

I looked around quickly, hoping Mars would show up any second, but I was 
disappointed. Dancing wouldn&#39;t be that bad would it? Was that what Mina 
tried to whisper to me on stage?

Instead of responding verbally I reached out my own hand and grasped 
hers gently. She pulled me onto the dance floor. My free hand 
immediately came up to shield my eyes until they adjusted to the light. 
Why is light concentration on the dance floor so intense? I felt myself 
grumble mentally.

When we were far enough in the crowd when Venus stopped to look at me. 
The dance was changing again. A few couples had switched dance partners 
and the women started the traditional curtsy. Kami, this was definitely 
something I&#39;m not good at! In an awkward manner I had somehow fumbled my 
way through the motion as Venus flawlessly performed her own at the same 
moment.

&quot;We&#39;re going to have to work on that Rei chan.&quot; Venus giggled at my 
expense.

Sure, you can teach dear Mars after I leave!

Out of the corner of my eyes I noticed Neptune and Uranus decided to 
take a break and were on the dance floor as well.

&quot;Ah, I guess that means things will pick up a bit.&quot; My partner observed.

&quot;What do you mean by pick up?&quot;

&quot;Hmm...I guess we&#39;ll just have to see.&quot;

&quot;You mean you don&#39;t know?&quot; I mean, come on! She practically lives here.

The band started to play and immediately the beat made me shudder 
slightly. The waltz, oh great.

&quot;You were always good at this particular dance if I remember correctly.&quot; 
Venus informed me.

I was? I don&#39;t even dance! Where is Mars when you need her?

Venus made the first move, bringing my hand to her waist and grasped my 
other with one of hers. My footing was clumsy at the start...but somehow 
it just all came back to me. Soon we were flying! A few couples even 
stopped to watch. Wow, maybe I should take dance at home sometime, it&#39;s 
a lot of fun.

&quot;See, I knew you could do it.&quot; My partner encouraged.

&quot;Uh...well after you get used to it.&quot;

Eep! I shut my mouth immediately and bit my bottom lip. Venus said I was 
practically pro at this! Damn, I let that slip. My eyes searched hers 
for any hint of confusion but she merely smiled.

&quot;You know Rei chan, we should do this more often when we go back.&quot;

We stopped our dance while the other couples continued. You mean...she&#39;s 
not Venus?

&quot;M-Mina chan?&quot;

&quot;Wow, that was amazing!&quot; A loud voice cheered.

I blinked to see Mina staring back at me with a blank expression. My own 
vision was somewhat clouded as well...my hands made their way up to rub 
my eyes. I was back...but...Looking back at the blond standing in front 
of me, I found myself questioning, are we back?

&quot;Great show.&quot; This time it was Amy who commented.

&quot;Yeah, I didn&#39;t expect you guys to start dancing the waltz!&quot; Makoto 
exclaimed, obviously impressed.

&quot;It was so beautiful...&quot; Usagi started to cry.

&quot;I...&quot; I glanced back at Mina. &quot;It just happened, right Mina chan?&quot; My 
elbow nudged her hard in the ribs.

&quot;Ouch!&quot; She snapped out of her blank expression and glared at me. Yup, 
she was back. &quot;Uh...Oh! Hai, just sort of happened! Glad you guys liked 
it.&quot;

&quot;You know, you two could be professional singers!&quot; Usagi blabbered on.

&quot;Ah...think so?&quot; I asked. I actually wanted to snap at her and say she 
was dreaming but she was drunk so what&#39;s the point?

&quot;I think so too...&quot;

A tall black, haired man approached our table. In a dramatic fashion he 
removed his shades, his slightly long hair bounced away from his face 
revealing baby blue eyes as he peered at Mina and myself.

&quot;Who are you?&quot; Makoto questioned sternly. Her arms seemed slightly 
tensed cautiously towards the stranger.

&quot;Nice to meet you, I&#39;m Yukio Manuke!&quot; The man enthusiastically grabbed 
Makoto&#39;s hands and shook them rapidly. &quot;Manager extraordinaire and I 
couldn&#39;t help but watch and I think your friends have some real talent 
here!&quot;

Kami, he sounds like a peppy salesman.

&quot;Here!&quot; He whipped out two of his cards to Mina&#39;s and my face. &#39;Yukio 
Manuke, scout for Raidon Music Enterprises&#39;.

&quot;If you are ever interested give me a call. I really, really think you 
have that unique something that could lead you to stardom!&quot;

&quot;Uhh...Sure.&quot; I replied quickly. Will he go away now? My head still 
hurts from the last memory.

&quot;Hey, now that&#39;s over with how about I stay for a few dri-&quot; He addressed 
Amy, who was looking very scared at that moment.

&quot;Uh, sorry! We&#39;re kind of busy right now, maybe later!&quot;

Makoto shoved the annoying man to the entrance and pushed him outside. 
Makoto, you&#39;re my hero! I mentally thanked her.

When she came back I glanced back at the card.

&quot;Mina chan, what do you...&quot;

Turning to look at my friend I saw that she had stars in her eyes. Mina 
chan...Kami, I can&#39;t believe this. First Mina and I end up dancing in a 
memory that isn&#39;t exactly ours and then we bump into a flirting freak 
who wants us to go into the singing business!

This...is going to be a long week, I found myself sighing.
