<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 8 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>&#147; Arg! Senshi it looks like their in Maya Park. Let&#146;s go!&#148; Terrestria 
was gone before any of them. Muttering about how stupid the youma were 
for always attacking in the park. The Senshi arrived in Maya park a 
few seconds later. Eleven different colored youma were standing in 
V-formation in front of them. A black one stepped forward, more 
towards Terrestrial than any other. It turned it&#146;s ugly face to talk. 

&#147; Are you Princess Terrestria?&#148; Terrestrial arched her perfect 
eyebrows and snapped her fingers. Bringing out her large black wings. 

&#147; At this moment I&#146;m not.&#148; The youma growled.

&#147; Master told me you were smug. I would like to tell you that Master 
wishes an audience with you.&#148; She tried not to laugh, really she did.

&#147; Your master? Youma these days. I go nowhere.&#148; the thing frowned. If 
you could tell.

&#147; I am NOT a youma, I&#146;m a kyphon.&#148; Before she could retort an answer 
the kyphon lunged at her with a black bladed sword. Terrestrial flew 
upwards and so did the kyphon. She drew her own sword. Sparks flew 
from the clashing blades. Terrestrial threw in kicks, only some hits 
connecting with it&#146;s black flesh. Terrestrial took just as many hits 
herself. Now 15 minutes later, both were tattered and bruised, and 
both swords were on the ground.

- Stupid kyphon. Time to end this!-

&#147; Planet Implode!&#148; The kyphon shrunk with in itself and finally blew. 
Terrestrial looked down in time to hear the others:

Venus-&#148; Light Rupture!&#148;

Mercury- &#147; Ice Hurricane Shatter!&#148;

Jupiter- &#147; Thunder Shock Beam!&#148;

Mars- &#147; Inferno Eruption!&#148;

Uranus- &#147; Wind Clamp!&#148;

Neptune- &#147; Titan Smash!&#148;

Pluto- &#147; Time Spears!&#148;

Saturn- &#147; Dark Daggers!&#148;

Moon- &#147; Moon Universal!&#148;

Earth- &#147; Earth Thorn!&#148;

Terrestrial smiled at them and started to fly down. Her tattered wings 
gave and she plummeted to the Earth. Narrowly being caught by Sailor 
Moon. Her transformation disappeared to show her Queen garb. They 
quickly teleported back to the Crystal Palace. Moon laid the Queen on 
the bed. Being careful not to damage her badly cut wings. Which for 
some reason stayed visual and just added to the girl&#146;s defeated look. 

&#147; Ami? What happened? The last time Dragon was this badly hurt was 
when she fought Dradian.&#148; Serena transformed into her regular attire 
and petted the Planet Queen&#146;s head in her lap. Ami typed away at her 
computer. Then finally looked up. 

&#147; Something else was draining her. That&#146;s why the kyphon beat her 
easily before she got the upper hand. For now we have to get rid of 
her cuts and bruises. Plus she has 3 broken ribs. I have know idea 
when she&#146;s gonna wake up.&#148; Ami&#146;s eyes rimmed with tears. -Why her?- 
Serena looked up.

&#147; Ami, bring in Hotaru please. She can lessen the injuries.&#148; Ami 
nodded and left. A second later Hotaru came in and immediately started 
to heal her &#145;sister&#146;. 

Ami stood out in the hall, the others finally noticing her presence. 
Amara looked up.

&#147; Well?&#148; Her voice was impatient. Ami just sighed.

&#147; I don&#146;t know when she&#146;s gonna wake up. Terri has many cuts and 
gashes. Not to mention bruises and 3 broken ribs. It&#146;s worse than when 
she fought Dradian, but&#133;&#148; Rei stopped pacing.

&#147; But? There&#146;s a but?&#148;

&#147; But&#133; Something else was draining energy from her. I&#146;ll have to look 
at pictures of the battle to determine what. I know this, it&#146;s 
strong.&#148;

&#147; Well yes it&#146;s strong. If it brought my dra- Terrestria to being in 
this state.&#148; Of course everyone noticed Rei&#146;s change in words. Rei 
just collapsed in a heap. Tears running down her face. Mina went to 
her. 

- Guess I should have the maids prepare eight rooms.- Luna pawed away 
a tear and walked away.

**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**

Well our beloved Terri is down again. But for how long? Who&#146;s the 
enemy? Questions that will be answered in the near future. This 
adventure is far from over people. Far from over&#133;</pre>
