<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 17 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch16.html">Back to Part 16</a><pre>The song is called &quot;Stray Cat Strut&quot; sung by Stray Cats. I don&#39;t own the 
song nor Sailor Moon. I don&#39;t own &quot;Baby got Back&quot; either. ;;
Makoto jumped high, much higher then she should have in civilan form and 
arched back, raising the sword above her head. As she fell forward, the 
blade sunk deep into the crystal in the crown atop Emerald&#39;s head. 
Emerald flug her head back, crying out in pain as lightening crackled 
around her.

Makoto jumped from the dragon&#39;s head, reaching out to grab to side of 
the next building. However, she fell a few inches short. As she began to 
fall to the ground, she felt a soft, fur covered hand grab her wrist to 
keep her from falling. Makoto looked up and saw a black, humanoid 
panther with red eyes holding her by the wrist to keep her from falling. 
Makoto smiled softly to her rescuer.
Makoto made her way back to the senshi who were still on the ground. 
Emerald&#39;s dragon body vanished when Makoto struck her with the sword. 
And the white panter had already retrieved his weapon and sheathed it by 
the time Makoto and the black panter, a female clad in a soft white 
dress, finally joined the group.

Sailor Moon looked from the male and female and glared. &quot;Ok, Luna and 
Artemis, you two have some explaining to do.&quot;

Artemis smiled. &quot;How&#39;d you know?&quot;

&quot;We probably wouldn&#39;t have known had you not had these on your head,&quot; 
Venus said, pressing her finger into Artmis&#39;s head where the cresent 
moon was.

&quot;Where&#39;s Sahpire,&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;He left after you defeated Emerald,&quot; Mars said.

&quot;We should hold this conversation someplace else,&quot; Mercury said. &quot;I hear 
sirens.&quot;

The others nodded and Luna and Artemis transformed into their normal 
feline forms and, after the senshi de-transformed, found their place on 
their wards&#39; shoulders. And then the group made their way to Mamoru&#39;s 
apartment.
&quot;So let me get this straight, without any powers you defeated Emerald?&quot; 
Mamoru asked, looking at Makoto. Makoto shifted a bit in her chair and 
nodded. Mamoru looked to Luna. &quot;From what you have told me, is it 
possiable Makoto&#39;s retained her powers, she just can&#39;t transform?&quot;

Luna looked thoughtful for a mimute. &quot;It is possiable. But without her 
transformation, she shouldn&#39;t fight. Despite how skimpy the fukus look, 
they are armor and keep the girls safe. Makoto won&#39;t have that if she 
can&#39;t change.&quot;

&quot;So what do we do,&quot; Usagi asked. &quot;I need Makoto. You saw how were nearly 
unable to defeat Malachite without her. This new enemy is stronger. We 
need her.&quot;

&quot;I know, Usagi. Thats why Artemis and I think we should give her a 
henishin pen that far exceedes the powers the rest of you have. With it, 
she&#39;ll be able to fight.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Great!&quot;

&quot;But there is a down side,&quot; Artemis said.

Makoto blinked. &quot;What?&quot;

&quot;You have to be very careful. Transforming will drain you of energy, 
even after you are use to it. You will be the only one who can use this 
level if transformation so power will shift among you. Thats why it will 
drain you.&quot;

&quot;So until we all can use it, it will wear me out faster,&quot; Makoto asked.

Artemis nodded. &quot;Hai. Also, because of the shift, you can NOT stay 
changed for very long. Thirty minutes in your morphas could send you 
into acoma. An hour could kill you. Do you still want the pen?&quot;

Without hesitation, Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

Luna nodded as well and pulled a pen out from behind her. It was green, 
with a jade dragon sitting atop it, in a praying postion. The dragon&#39;s 
wings were wrapped around it, its long head bent downward in prayer, and 
the tail was wrapped down along the pen.

&quot;When you need it, just say &#39;Jupiter Dragon Power, Make-up&#39;, and you 
will change.&quot; Makoto nodded and took the pen from Luna. &quot;I should advise 
you to train in your new powers before fighting. That way, you will be 
somewhat use to its effect.&quot;

Again, Makoto nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll do that.&quot;

&quot;So next line of business,&quot; Usagi said. &quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell us you 
could change forms?&quot;

Luna blinked and had the grace to look embaressed. &quot;We were never needed 
to change before.&quot;

&quot;Are those your true forms,&quot; Ami asked.

&quot;Yes they are,&quot; Artemis said. &quot;We stay in feline form because it takes 
too much out of us to stay in hybrid form too long. We are advisors, not 
warriors.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you don&#39;t have wings,&quot; Rei asked. Luna nodded.

&quot;Cool,&quot; Usagi said. She then looked up at Mamoru. &quot;Muffin, where&#39;s 
Chibi-Usa?&quot;

&quot;Bed. It is past midnight.&quot; Usagi nodded and yawned then.

Makoto smiled. &quot;I think we should all head home.&quot; Makoto stood, Minako 
taking her hand and standing as well. &quot;Luna, you are more than welcome 
to come home with us, seeing as I have a feeling Usagi will be staying 
here tonight.&quot; Usagi blushed and Luna sighed.

&quot;I think I will.&quot; She and Artemis padded their way to the front door, 
waiting for Minako and Makoto. Rei and Ami followed them out.

Rei and Ami went their seperate ways, and Minako and Makoto along with 
the feline gaurdians made their way to Makoto&#39;s loft.

Minako leaned into Makoto&#39;s arm and squeezed her hand gently. Makoto 
smiled and placed a soft kiss atop Minako&#39;s head.

&quot;Maybe going home with you two was such a good idea either,&quot; Luna 
teased. Makoto laughed and Minako just seemed to snuggle into Makoto&#39;s 
side more. Beside Luna, Artemis was humming a song, his tiny feet 
seemingly wanting to dance. Luna blinked.

&quot;What are you doin?&quot;

Artemis smirked and began to sing, his body slinking to the tune of the 
song..

&quot;Black and orange stray cat sittin&#39; on a fence
Ain&#39;t got enough dough to pay the rent
I&#39;m flat broke but I don&#39;t care
I strut right by with my tail in the air

Stray cat strut I&#39;m a (lady&#39;s cat)
I&#39;m a feline Casanova hey (man that&#39;s sad)
Get a shoe thrown at me from a mean old man
Get my dinner from a garbage can

(Yeah--, don&#39;t cross my path!)

I don&#39;t bother chasing mice around
I slink down the alley, looking for a fight
Howlin&#39; to the moonlight on a hot summer night

Singin&#39; the blues while the lady cats cry
Wild stray cat you&#39;re a real gone guy
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class, and I got cat style

I don&#39;t bother chasing mice around
I slink down the alley, looking for a fight
Howlin&#39; to the moonlight on a hot summer night

Singin&#39; the blues while the lady cats cry
Wild stray cat you&#39;re a real gone guy
I wish I could be as carefree and wild
But I got cat class, and I got cat style&quot;
As they reached Makoto&#39;s apartment building, Artemis finished singing.

&quot;You have issues my dear comrade.&quot;

Artemis smiled. &quot;Hai. But you love me.&quot; Luna seemed to blush and walk 
fatser...
Makoto and Minako went to bed the moment they walked thru the door. Luna 
slept at the foor of their bed, snoring peacfully. Artemis laid next to 
her, but when she fell asleep, he snuck out of the room and into the 
spare room Makoto&#39;s studio was.

After a few moments, Artemis snuck his head out, looked up and down the 
hall way then jumped out of the room, wearing a jester&#39;s hat and began 
to dance on his hind legs down the hall, singing again-

&quot;I like big butts and I cannot lie
You other brothers can&#39;t deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull up front
Cuz you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she&#39;s wearing
I&#39;m hooked and I can&#39;t stop stari-&quot;

&quot;Artemis, what do you think you&#39;re doing?!&quot;

Artemis stopped dead in his tracks, and turned back to look behind him. 
Luna stood there, eyes glowing red in the dark hallway.

Artemis sat on his hunched and nervously laughed, &quot;N-nothing, Luna.&quot;

Luna looked at him then went back inside the bedroom and shut the door 
quietly.</pre>
