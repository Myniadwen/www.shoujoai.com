New Stars Emerge! The Chibi Starlights Appear! 

Chibi-usa and Diana had returned for a little while. Usagi asked why 
was she still here and who was her real father. Chibi-usa answered, 
&#147;Since you have such a smart mouth Usagi-chan I won&#146;t tell you.&#148; 

&#147;You little brat! As your mother I order you to tell me this instant!&#148; 
Usagi screamed. Chibi-usa continued to do her homework ignoring Usagi 
completely. &#147;Let it go Usagi, she MIGHT tell you sooner or later.&#148; 
Luna said. &#147;She would tell you Usagi-sama, but Neo-Queen Serenity told 
us not to,&#148; Diana admitted, &#147;She said when the time is right you&#146;ll 
find out on your own.&#148; 

&#147;T.M.I. Diana,&#148; Chibi-usa warned. 

Just then the 3lights entered the living room with Seiya and Yaten 
arguing, &#147;I swear those two are about as worse as Rei-chan and Usagi.&#148; 
Luna said. &#147;But that&#146;s why we love &#145;em.&#148; Usagi added in. &#147;Ahh! Don&#146;t 
pull my hair! You know how long it takes me to make it perfect!&#148; Yaten 
shouted struggling in Seiya&#146;s grip. &#147;Then stop kicking me in the ass!&#148; 
Seiya ordered. &#147;It&#146;s not MY fault your ass is huge!&#148; 

&#147;Why you...!&#148; 

&#147;Taiki-san will you help me with my homework in the peace and sanity 
of my room?&#148; Usagi asked. &#147;Sanity wasn&#146;t really the word.&#148; Luna said. 
&#147;But Taiki-sama always helps me with my homework.&#148; Chibi-usa said. 
&#147;Well that&#146;s the future this is now. Besides I asked first!&#148; 

&#147;Like she would help you! If you paid more attention in school you 
wouldn&#146;t help!&#148; 

&#147;The why are asking for it!?&#148; 

&#147;Because I&#146;ve just started middle school. You&#146;ve been in high school 
forever! You should now how to add and subtract by now!&#148; 

&#147;I DO know how!&#148; 

&#147;You lie!&#148; 

&#147;I lie?&#148; 

&#147;Yes you!&#148; 

&#147;You stuck-up little odango-atama!&#148; 

&#147;At least I don&#146;t have an odango brain!&#148; 

&#147;Can&#146;t you just feel the estrogen in the air?&#148; Taiki teased. &#147;SHUT-UP 
TAIKI!&#148; Seiya and Yaten shouted in union. The four of them had been 
arguing for an hour when Taiki decided to go for a walk and Luna 
followed her. 

&#147;I admire you Taiki-san,&#148; Luna said, &#147;You MUST have a lot of sanity to 
keep yourself from going insane from those two.&#148; 

&#147;You don&#146;t know the half of it Luna-san.&#148; 

&#147;Sooo, Ami-chan told me that you&#146;re together now ne?&#148; Luna asked with 
a grin on her face. Taiki blushed, &#147;Yeah, but that doesn&#146;t mean you 
can tell the whole world.&#148; 

&#147;We really haven&#146;t interacted much have we Taiki-san? Let me tell ya 
the one you should look out for is Minako-chan. She&#146;s the one that&#146;ll 
tell the whole world.&#148; 

&#147;I figured that much.&#148; The two continue to talk when a girl around 
Chibi-usa&#146;s age, long brown hair which she wore in a ponytail like 
Taiki only with bangs and a curl on each side of her head and blue 
eyes that were similar to Ami&#146;s appeared from the left. &#147;Otousan!&#148; she 
shouted and ran up to Taiki hugging her. &#147;Okaasan that you&#146;d be around 
here somewhere. I&#146;m so glad I found you Otousan.&#148; She said. &#147;Ano, I 
think you got the wrong person.&#148; Taiki said nervously. Then out of 
nowhere an ANGRY Ami appeared. &#147;Kou-chan...!&#148; she said. &#147;Ami-chan...&#148; 

&#147;So you&#146;re cheating on me already!? After I gave all my love to you!?&#148; 
she asked with fire in her eyes. &#147;Ami-chan there&#146;s been some mistake, 
I have no idea who this is!&#148; 

&#147;Yeah! The mistake was YOU!&#148; Ami shouted. She slapped her, &#147;I never 
wanna see you again!&#148; and ran off. &#147;Ami-chan!&#148; Taiki said and went 
after her. The girl was wondering what went wrong. Surprisingly the 
same type of incident happened to Yaten and Seiya. 

Meanwhile Princes Kaori was yelling at Kado for is poor efforts. &#147;I 
don&#146;t want to hear anymore of your excuses!&#148; he shouted. There was a 
blast of white light and when it faded Kado was reduced to bones and 
dust. &#147;Marise, I hope you can do better.&#148; Prince Kaori said to the new 
figure, &#147;Hai Kaori-sama.&#148; Marise said. 

Marise was in her quarters when a young woman appeared sitting on his 
desk, &#147;Go away Ayame.&#148; He ordered. &#147;Ahh aren&#146;t you happy to see me?&#148; 
she asked. &#147;Am I ever?&#148; 

&#147;Of course you are! And why wouldn&#146;t you?&#148; 

&#147;Because you&#146;re annoying!&#148; 

&#147;Anyway... do you have a plan to capture Fighter?&#148; 

&#147;I&#146;m working on it.&#148; 

&#147;Who&#146;s the other girl Yaten-chan!?&#148; Minako demanded once they were 
home, &#147;Who have you been cheatin&#146; on me with!?&#148; 

&#147;Mina-chan I haven&#146;t cheated on you with anybody! I love you. You&#146;re 
the only one I have eyes for.&#148; 

&#147;Then why did she call you father!?&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t know. She&#146;s got me confused with somebody else!&#148; 

&#147;Who Yaten-chan!? Who!? Who else has a silver ponytail!? Tell me 
that!&#148; &#145;Damn she really knows how to hurt a person.&#146; Yaten thought. 

[CM] 

Usagi was in the park crying, &#147;How could she do this to me?&#148; she asked 
Luna through her tears. &#147;Usagi if you really love Seiya-chan the why 
didn&#146;t you believe her? A relationship is based on trust you know.&#148; 
Luna said. Then she saw Ami and Minako and asked them to join her 
which they did. &#147;Geez, looking at those three you&#146;d think someone just 
died!&#148; Artemis said. &#147;Oh God I let her in my house!&#148; Minako cried, 
&#147;Who knows what she could have gave me.&#148; 

Chibi-usa was sitting on one of the swings talking to Diana, &#147;What&#146;s 
going on here?&#148; she asked her, &#147;Why did Usagi-baka take us to the 
park?&#148; 

&#147;I don&#146;t know Small Lady, but when we left Usagi-sama was crying as 
was Seiya-san. Something bad must have happened between them.&#148; 

&#147;Well I hope everything works out...&#148; Then she saw a couple being 
attacked by a youma, &#147;Henshi Small Lady!&#148; Diana ordered. &#147;MOON CRISIS, 
MAKE-UP!&#148; Chibi-usa shouted and transformed into Super Sailor Chibi 
Moon! 

&#147;Yurusunai!&#148; Chibi Moon shouted. The youma turned to face her, &#147;Ai to 
seigi no sailor fuku Bishoujo Senshi, Sailor Chibi Moon! Tsukini 
kawatte oshiokiyo! PINK SUGAR HEART ATTACK!&#148; The attack didn&#146;t work, 
&#147;Dammit not again!&#148; Chibi Moon cursed. The youma started trying to 
slice Chibi Moon in half with its long sharp claws. &#147;Chibi Moon don&#146;t 
get stuck in a...&#148; Diana began, but Chibi Moon got stuck in a corner, 
&#147;corner...&#148; Diana finished sweat dropping. &#147;Ahh someone help me!&#148; Then 
Crystal Sailor Moon, the Inner and Outer Senshi, the Starlights 
arrived. &#147;STAR MAKER RELAXTION!&#148; 

&#147;MERCURY ARTICT BLIZZARD!&#148; The youma then started making doubles of 
its-self and the attacks missed. The doubles started beating up the 
senshi. 

Mercury and Neptune were about to do a combined attack, but were punch 
in the stomach. Diana decided to jump in a bit the youma from behind. 
&#147;Diana!&#148; Luna and Artemis exclaimed and went to go help her. The youma 
managed to get rid of all of them and was about destroy them when 
another attack hit them. &#147;That attack...&#148; Chibi Moon said. 

&#147;Surround by the new darkness of night, Sailor Chibi Star Fighter!&#148; 

&#147;The new secret movement away from death??? Sailor Chibi Star Healer!&#148; 

&#147;The new angle of freedom who runs freely, Sailor Chibi Star Maker!&#148; 

&#147;SAILOR CHIBI STARLIGHTS STAGE ON!&#148; 

&#147;Natsuko, Satu-chan, Taka-san!&#148; Chibi Moon exclaimed. Crystal Sailor 
Moon noticed a star with a crescent moon under it on Chibi Fighter&#146;s 
tiara, &#147;Oh God...!&#148; Moon said. Mercury noticed a star with the mercury 
sign under it on Chibi Maker&#146;s tiara, &#147;Oh no...!&#148; she said. Venus 
noticed a star with the sign of Venus under it on Chibi Healer&#146;s 
tiara, &#147;Oh shit...!&#148; 

&#147;OH GOD!!!&#148; all three Starlights said in union and fainted. &#147;STAR 
FIELD CONSTELATION!&#148; Chibi Fighter shouted. &#147;STAR MAKER MUSIC BOX!&#148; 
Chibi Maker shouted. &#147;STAR HEALER BEAM!&#148; Chibi Healer shouted. When 
the youma was weak enough the doubles vanished and Crystal Moon 
destroyed it. 

&#147;So Chibi-usa how do you know these girls?&#148; Usagi asked. &#147;Well Natsuko 
is my little sister!&#148; Chibi-usa answered. Natsuko looked exactly like 
Seiya only her hair was a little shorted. At her feet was a black and 
white kitten, &#147;Diana!&#148; it said a nuzzled her. &#147;Who&#146;s that?&#148; Usagi 
asked. &#147;That&#146;s Apollo Okaasan. He&#146;s Luna-san&#146;s and Artemis-san son.&#148; 
Natsuko answered. Luna and Artemis were shocked. &#147;And Taka-san is 
Ami-chan&#146;s and Taiki-san&#146;s second daughter. And Satu-chan is 
Yaten-chan&#146;s and Minako-chan oldest daughter.&#148; Chibi-usa finished. 
Seiya just stared not blinking, Taiki blushed along with Ami, and 
Yaten had fainted in Minako&#146;s arms. </pre>
