<a href="../smoon/bedstories-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>&quot;I&#39;m sorry Hotaru and Setsuna couldn&#39;t be here, kiddo!  Its just 
you and me till Michiru gets home.  So, ya wanna play some vids?&quot;

&quot;Tell me a story instead!&quot;

&quot;Story?  I&#39;m not too big on stories.  Michiru usually handles 
that.  What kind of story?  Not something with whiny princesses 
in towers simpering about Prince Charming, I hope.&quot;

&quot;I want to know about Auntie Ami and Auntie Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Oh.  Well.  Ok.  What do you want to know?  Shouldn&#39;t you be 
asking your mom about this stuff?&quot;

&quot;She already told me what she knows but I want to know more.&quot;

&quot;Um, yeah.  Ok.  Well, when two people love each other...&quot;

&quot;You can start after Ami ran out during karaoke! That&#39;s where 
Momma left off.&quot;

&quot;Ohhhh, that story.  Well, it&#39;s kind of personal.  Makoto told me 
about it not too long after.  We&#39;d wanted to compare notes, you 
know?&quot;

&quot;But Ami and Mako already told me some of it. I&#39;m sure they 
wouldn&#39;t mind.  It is a love story, isn&#39;t it?  Mommy always says 
there&#39;s nothing more important than love!&quot;

&quot;Ok ok, I&#39;ll tell you, but please, give it a rest.  Its bad 
enough hearing that trite crap from your mom when we&#39;re 
&#39;working&#39;.  Now where to begin...&quot;

---------------------------
It took a moment for Makoto&#39;s eyes to adjust to the lights 
outside.  Streetlights and neon glared off of passing cars and 
black streets as a cold wind buffeted her.  

&quot;Think, baka, think. Its Ami, you know her better than anyone.  
Where would she go?  Damn you, Usagi, why did you have to pick a 
song like that.  What am I going to say?  All a misunderstanding, 
I don&#39;t love you, I just... I was thinking of my old sempai.  
That&#39;s it.  I should send that ass a check to pay him back for 
how much I use him.  She&#39;ll laugh, I&#39;ll take her home, all will 
be well. But where, where would she go?&quot;

Looking down the street, Makoto shielded her eyes from a 
particularly bright glare.  &quot;It hasn&#39;t been raining, what&#39;s 
causing that?&quot; she thought as she moved slowly in that direction.  
When she realized what it was, she gasped.  A trashcan, frozen 
solid, shone underneath a lamppost.   Further down the road, 
another patch of light.  A tree, each leaf covered in a delicate 
layer of frost.  

Makoto started to run, following the trail and calling Ami&#39;s 
name. She found her kneeling at the edge of a pond in the 
neighborhood park.  Makoto quickly noticed the crystals hanging 
from the grass nearby, but soon all of her attention was focused 
on her quarry.  Wrapping her arms around herself tight, she moved 
to stand beside her closest, dearest friend.

&quot;Ami, I just wanted to say... you see...&quot;

&quot;Just stop, Makoto, please. Don&#39;t say anything, I can&#39;t handle 
that now,&quot; Ami barked between gasps.  Tears clung to her cheeks, 
which almost matched her hair from the cold.  &quot;I... I... just 
need to be... alone!&quot;  The last word escaped with a wail of pain 
that stabbed deep into Makoto&#39;s heart.   The tears flowed freely 
again as Ami slumped down to the ground.

&quot;Please, Ami-chan, please, don&#39;t cry.  Let me explain.&quot;

&quot;NO! Don&#39;t! I can&#39;t take this, not from you!  Not From You!&quot;  Ami 
glared up at Makoto through blurry eyes.

&quot;Ami... don&#39;t,&quot; Mako replied quietly, her own tears welling up 
now.

&quot;Stop it!&quot; Ami jumped to her feet and assumed a battle stance. 
&quot;Don&#39;t you get it, I never wanted to sing that song, I never did. 
Usagi made me. I hate her, I hate all of you. Why couldn&#39;t you 
all have just left me alone?  I didn&#39;t know any better!  You 
can&#39;t be sad if you don&#39;t know what happy is!  I was... I was 
fine, I would have been fine.&quot;

Makoto stepped forward slowly, opening her arms.  No matter what 
she felt, no matter what worried her, nothing was more important 
to her than this delicate soul, this fierce, brilliant, perfect 
being laid bare before her.  &quot;It&#39;s ok, Ami.&quot;

&quot;Shut up! Just shut up!&quot; Ami screamed.  As Makoto moved closer, 
Ami growled and began pounding on her friend&#39;s chest with her 
fists.  &quot;Its all your fault, damn you, Mako.  Why did you have to 
do this to me? Why!&quot;

Makoto shuddered.  Though Ami was not hitting her enough to 
bruise, each blow struck straight at her heart.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami. 
I didn&#39;t mean for it to happen.&quot;

&quot;Shut up, I told you! I&#39;m so tired of it! I study and I work and 
I take care of the apartment and fighting the Negaverse and the 
Dark Moon, all of it and there didn&#39;t used to be anything else 
but now I can&#39;t imagine being without you.  And when you leave 
me, I ache inside and when you aren&#39;t there, all I want to do is 
be where you are and I don&#39;t think I can imagine living without 
you and just when I think I can handle how I feel you go and sing 
that song and rip my heart out and I just can&#39;t fake it anymore I 
can&#39;t pretend I don&#39;t love you anymore but I can&#39;t lose you 
and...&quot;  Ami stopped punching and collapsed against Makoto&#39;s 
chest, wheezing between her sobs, burrowing her head to try to 
escape everything.

Makoto froze.  &quot;What is she saying? She&#39;s not mad because I love 
her, she&#39;s mad because... because she loves me?&quot;  Makoto didn&#39;t 
say anything, she just held Ami tight.  The more Ami drove her 
face against her, the tighter Makoto drew her arms together 
around the young girl&#39;s back.  As Ami&#39;s breathing slowly settled 
down, Makoto began to murmur comforting words and slowly stroked 
her hair.  &quot;Shh, its ok, Ami-chan.  Its ok. Let it all out.  Its 
all ok.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not ok,&quot; Ami mumbled, trying not to cry again. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Mako, I&#39;m sorry.  I shouldn&#39;t have said anything.  Maybe I&#39;m 
coming down with something.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure its just that I&#39;m not feeling well, too much smoke in 
there. I&#39;m really all right, please, I didn&#39;t mean anything.  
Please don&#39;t be mad at me.&quot;

&quot;I love you.  With all of my heart, with all that I am and with 
all that I ever hope to be, I love you.&quot;

---------------------
&quot;Ohhh, that&#39;s so sweet.  I love part of that story, Haruka-chan.&quot;

&quot;Shhh! Auntie Michiru!  We&#39;re just getting to the good part.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Chibi.  I&#39;ll be quiet.  I just wanted Haruka to know 
how very much I admire her storytelling.  She doesn&#39;t think she 
does it very well.&quot;

&quot;Well, parts of this story aren&#39;t that unfamiliar.&quot;

&quot;You left bruises, my love.  You&#39;re a bit stronger than sweet 
little Ami.&quot;

&quot;Get on with the story!!!!!!!&quot;

&quot;Ok, ok kiddo, keep your panties on.  So, anyway...&quot;
---------------------

Ami froze.  This just couldn&#39;t be. Why would Makoto say such a 
thing?  Ami was trying to give them both an out, something to 
cling to so they could pretend this horrible night never 
happened.  Maybe Makoto was still mad at her, but if so, why did 
she keep saying that.  Ami knew Mako was not a cruel woman.  
Could she?

Suddenly, she became aware of just where she was.  She could feel 
Makoto&#39;s breasts pressed against both of her cheeks, Makoto&#39;s 
fingers idly stroking the base of her neck.  Makoto filled her 
senses and for a moment, Ami thought she&#39;d pass out from the 
sensation. Tentatively, she lifted her head. 

&quot;Makoto?  Mako-chan? What are you saying?&quot;

&quot;You know, for a genius, you&#39;re pretty slow on the uptake 
sometimes,&quot; Makoto laughed gently, lowering her gaze to meet her 
friend&#39;s.  &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it any better so I&#39;ll just 
have to say it again, and again, and again, till you believe me.  
I love you.&quot;

Ami&#39;s eyes dropped to the ground.  This couldn&#39;t be happening.  
How could a dream come true when you&#39;d never even allowed 
yourself the luxury of dreaming it?  Genius?  Ami doubted at that 
moment that she could count to four.  All that she heard, all 
that existed in her mind were those words.

&quot;I love you, Ami-chan, and I&#39;ll never get tired of telling you.&quot;
Keeping her face pointed down, Ami lifted her eyes.  She could 
barely see Makoto through the moisture clinging to her long 
lashes, and yet she found herself lost in the deep emerald sea 
that threatened to wash her away entirely.

&quot;You... you love me?&quot; she whispered in awe.

&quot;I&#39;ve loved you since I first saw you.  You are the best friend 
anyone could ever dream of; you&#39;re the most brilliant person in 
the world; you are kind, sweet, gentle, caring and, I must say, a 
SuperHottie!&quot;

Ami lost feeling in her toes as all the blood in her extremities 
went to her face.  A light mist rose around the two of them as 
the warmth that slowly infused Ami&#39;s core radiated out into the 
cold air.  Shyly, she reached up and laid her hand against 
Makoto&#39;s cheek.  

&quot;No, Mako-chan,&quot; she giggled, &quot;I&#39;m nowhere near as beautiful as 
you are.&quot;  Standing up straight, she took Makoto&#39;s face between 
both of her palms. &quot;I love you, too, Mako-chan.  I think I have 
for a very long time now, but I was too silly to realize it.&quot;

&quot;We both were, my love. You know everything, but you couldn&#39;t 
even figure out that you loved me.  I&#39;m not afraid of anything, 
but the thought of sharing my feelings with you made me run 
screaming.  Well, it would have if you hadn&#39;t beaten me to it.&quot; 
&quot;Oh Mako-chan! I do love you, I do! I guess we have both been 
quite silly,&quot; Ami said with a shy smile.

&quot;Now, I think its time we stopped,&quot; Makoto replied in a sudden, 
dangerously serious tone.  

Gently, she pulled Ami forward, tilting her head, and kissing her 
softly.  At the touch of Makoto&#39;s lips, Ami gasped and let her 
love draw her into a complete embrace.  Seizing the opportunity 
of this deep breath, Makoto drew Ami&#39;s lower lip between her own, 
pulling gently.  Her hands traced lines across Ami&#39;s back as they 
moved up into her hair.   Carefully, she slid her tongue across 
her love&#39;s mouth. Makoto was quite startled when Ami growled and 
pulled her down, kissing her passionately.  Her eyes shot open 
and found Ami&#39;s gaze drilling into them with a fierce blue fire.  
&quot;Oh my! Ami!&quot; Makoto murmured as Ami dragged her to the ground 
with a snarl.
-----------------

&quot;I think that&#39;s a good place to stop, don&#39;t you Haruka-chan?&quot;

&quot;Huh? What? Oh!  Umm, yeah!  Sorry, Michiru, I got a little 
carried away.&quot;

&quot;Awww! I want to hear the rest of it!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, kiddo!  They lived happily ever after, how about that!  
Maybe when you&#39;re 16 I&#39;ll tell you the rest.&quot;

&quot;Haruka!&quot;

&quot;Kidding, Michiru-chan, kidding!  21, at least.&quot;

&quot;I wanted to hear all the [yawn] story.&quot;

&quot;Time for bed now, kiddo. Say night night.&quot;

[yawn] &quot;G&#39;night.&quot;

&quot;And if I know you, my Haruka-chan, you&#39;ll be wanting to go to 
&#39;bed&#39; now too?&quot;

&quot;If you insist, Michiru!  I&#39;ll race ya!&quot;</pre>
