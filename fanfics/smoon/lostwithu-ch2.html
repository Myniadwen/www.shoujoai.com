<p><strong>Tokyo airport, 9.24 AM, that same day.</strong></p>
<p><em>&quot;Mina,  are you sure this delay won't be a problem? I know how you have to be  busy with rehearsal and all. God, I still can't believe it... my friend  in a Broadway musical!&quot; Serena exclaimed, barely restraining her  excitement, even if that was at least the thousandth time she said  that. &quot;But I'm sure when you'll be a famous actress they'll never make  mistakes with your reservation!&quot; She smiled winking at her friend.</em></p>
<p><em>Mina's  face seemed to darken suddenly, but soon she smiled back at her friend,  &quot;Of course not! They'll ask me for autographs and will offer me  champagne on the plane.&quot; She said forming a 'V' with her index and  middle fingers.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah! I'm really sorry I won't be able to watch you perform...&quot; Serena said sadly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Come  on! Don't be sorry, you'll be occupied with your new life in Japan,  you'll won't even remember your old friends from US!&quot; Mina winked at  her friend.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh, that will never happen, and you know it!  It' will be you the one who'll forget us when you'll be a movie star!&quot;  The pigtailed girl said. After a little pause she smiled broadly and  said: &quot;Let's go get ice-cream while we're waiting, I'm hungry!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Serena we had our breakfast only half an hour ago.&quot; Mina said shaking her head, the red ribbon in her blonde hair shaking too.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I know, but airports make me hungry, you know.&quot; Her pigtailed friend said as she made her way to the cafeteria.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Serena, just go ahead with Darien, I'll come later.&quot; She said pointing to two very handsome stewards approaching.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh,  ok.&quot; Serena answered then she turned to look where her friend was  pointing and added, &quot;Oh... of course. See you later then.&quot; She  concluded winking knowingly and went towards her dark-haired boyfriend.</em></p>
<p><em>Mina walked towards the two stewards putting on a large smile to hide her troubled face.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Pacific Ocean, somewhere, present.</strong></p>
<p>A  couple of hours had passed since the falling wing had crashed the  cabin. The survivors were trying to deal with what had just happened,  everyone in his - or her - personal way.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi, I'm Umino. I was  sat right behind you in there.&quot; The young man with thick glasses  offered his right hand to the pregnant girl while with his left thumb  he pointed towards the wreckage. His English was heavily accented but  good. Molly looked up at him smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Hi Umino, I'm Molly, and this is Alex,&quot; she said caressing her swollen belly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, do you already know he's going to be a boy?&quot; He said looking intently at her stomach.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no, I don't know if it'll be <em>Alexandra</em> or <em>Alexander</em>,&quot; she said giggling.</p>
<p>He  looked at her confused for a moment then he understood. Blushing he  scratched at the back of his head embarrassed. The girl laughed then  patted the sand beside her gesturing him to take a seat.</p>
<p>A few  meters away a makeshift tent was built with sticks and towels to offer  shelter for the injured people. Dr. Mizuno and Ami were resting after  having attended their patients for all they could do with the  unexpected help of Rei's grandfather. The Shintoist priest had a couple  of medical rudiments and an enviable practical sense. Both things  extremely useless in that situation.</p>
<p>At the same time Rei was  occupied in convincing Yuiichiro she was alright, but she wasn't having  any success. She was so exasperated that started yelling at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't be such a fuss, baka! I told you I'm ok!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But Rei-chan-...&quot; the young man tried to dissent for the umpteenth time but she cut him off.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough!  I won't tolerate another word from you, Kumada-san!&quot; She addressed him  with deliberate detachment and the lack of familiarity didn't pass  unnoticed to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen Rei-san, I'll go see if I can help with  anything.&quot; He said softly and stood up. She looked at him and realized  she had overreacted. Her expression softened.</p>
<p>&quot;Yuiichiro-chan...&quot; she murmured but he was already gone and couldn't hear her.</p>
<p>In  a secluded spot under a tree Furuhata was sat fumbling with a sheet of  paper. When he had it unfolded he didn't look at it, he just stared  into space instead.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll come, onee-chan, I'd just be a little late...&quot; He murmured to the light breeze.</p>
<p>Near  the wreckage Lita was walking amid corpses, metal fragments and every  sort of discarded objects. She looked around taking in the desolate  scenery before her. When she lifted her head she could see a flash of  metal in the distance right where the lonely man with long brown hair  stood smoking a cigarette, she locked eyes with him for a long moment  until he winked at her and turned away.</p>
<p>Not too far the three Kou brothers and Michiru had found shelter from the hot sun under a big fragment of the plane.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can't believe I passed out and I don't even have a bump!&quot; Yaten was  complaining searching his head for any sign of concussion.</p>
<p>&quot;You better search your pants... I think you passed out from fright!&quot; Seiya said elbowing his younger brother.</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya!&quot; Taiki scolded, &quot;There's a lady with us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Don't worry Taiki-san, I think I'm beyond shock today.&quot; She said looking at the wreckage in the distance.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen  Michiru-chan, I forgot my manners.&quot; Seiya said, truly sorry. He looked  at her searching for a smile of forgiveness for his rudeness but she  never looked back at him, neither she did when she stood up and started  walking towards the other survivors.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm gonna check on little Hotaru-chan.&quot; And with that she was gone much for Seiya's surprise.</p>
<p>Haruka was sat under a tree with Hotaru asleep in her lap. Her gaze was lost in the horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, how are you?&quot; Michiru whispered not wanting to wake the exhausted child.&quot;The both of you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She's asleep.&quot; Was the curt-reply.</p>
<p>&quot;That  I can see...&quot; Michiru commented as she sat down beside them. &quot;How's  your shoulder?&quot; She asked again. Haruka turned finally looking at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it's fine. It'll be as good as new soon.&quot; She gave the aqua-haired beauty a small smile.</p>
<p>&quot;I  see...&quot; Michiru replied. After that they remained in silence, Haruka  with her gaze on the horizon again and Michiru caressing Hotaru's head.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Other  three persons were sat in thoughtful silence. Darien had his arms  around Serena's shoulders while the pigtailed girl was sitting between  his legs facing opposite of him. She had tears stained cheeks and was  leaning back in the comfort of her boyfriend's embrace. A couple of  steps away from them Mina was looking down at the sand sliding between  her own fingers.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;You  have messages...&quot; A slightly metallic voice said. Hope sparkled in her  blue eyes, she gripped the handset so tightly that her knuckles turned  white.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Let it be them, let it be them...&quot; She repeated her mantra again and again.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;BIP  Hello Mina, it's Serena. Darien and I wanted to remind you our dinner  tomorrow night. There will be a friend of Darien's too. Bye!... Oh! I  was forgetting: good luck for your casting, I hope you already have an  answer from them! I'm sure it'll be fine. See ya tomorrow! BIIIIP&quot; Then  the metallic voice added, &quot;End of the message. You have no more  messages.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>She stood there in disappointment closing her watering eyes, the handset now held loosely by shaking hands.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Mina!  Mina, damn it! Where the hell are you!&quot; Came the shouts from around the  corner. &quot;Ah, there you are. Move that cute ass of yours and come back  to work, I don't pay you to fool with the phone!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Mina hung up the phone, leaned back against the stained wall and slumped down to the plastic floor.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Mina! You heard me? Do you think it would be difficult for me to find another cute and desperate-for-a-job chick out there?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Coming!  Don't be such a pain!&quot; She yelled back as she stood and rubbed away the  tears before they had a chance to fall from her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>She entered the crowded and noisy dining room still tying the white apron she wore on her very short, pink uniform. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Remind me again why I don't fire you?&quot; Her boss, a bristly man in his late thirties asked her as she passed near the counter.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Cause you like too much to see this every time I pass by you!&quot; She said pointing at her rear.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>He was left wordless as she approached a table to take the order swaying her hips suggestively.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>&quot;Someone up there told me you're the one to talk to.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  opened her eyes disturbed by the sudden shadow and the brusqueness of  the voice. A tall figure was towering her, obscuring the sun. First she  looked up at the newcomer then she looked down at the two sleeping  figures, one in her lap, the other curled up against her right  shoulder. Then she looked up again putting her index finger in front of  her nose.</p>
<p>&quot;Shhh!&quot; She said.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh! Sorry.&quot; The tall brunette  whispered blushing, she scratched the back of her head and giggled very  embarrassed, the previous harsh attitude completely gone.</p>
<p>At that point Haruka felt stirring at her right side and two ocean-blue eyes blinked open.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  sleepy-head...&quot; The blonde said smiling gently. Then was Michiru's turn  to blush when she realized that she had fallen asleep on Haruka's  shoulder and that they weren't alone either.</p>
<p>&quot;So, what can I do for you?&quot; Haruka asked Lita.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I was thinking about... doing something.&quot; She said suddenly feeling self-conscious.</p>
<p>&quot;Something... like?&quot; Haruka asked not understanding what the other girl meant.</p>
<p>&quot;Anything!&quot;  Lita said turning around and gesturing at the entire beach tracing an  arc in the air with her arm. Haruka continued to stare at her blinking.  &quot;Anything. Any-other-thing but sitting and waiting.&quot; She turned towards  the wreckage and continued, &quot;We should start thinking what we're going  to do. Nobody has shown up, no rescue, no ships on the horizon...  nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They should be here by now, you're right...&quot; Haruka  pondered the situation then stood with the still asleep Hotaru in her  arms. She winced as she strained her injured shoulder. Michiru  realizing it was immediately standing and taking the child from her. In  that moment Lita noticed for the first time the handkerchief holding  the blonde's arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, we should gather and decide what to do.&quot;  Haruka turned to look at Michiru who nodded in agreement. Then they  walked to the 'hospital tent'.</p>
<p>When they had gathered everyone  they stood in a circle and begun discussing. As soon as Seiya had  reached the group he found Michiru and circled her waist with his arm  possessively more than protectively... or that was how it felt for  Michiru.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>The room was  bare, with white walls and no windows. The artificial light of the  trembling neon sent blurring flash on the desk's surface. The unkindly  brusque assistant pushed her inside unceremoniously. No one was there.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Get ready, he'll be here soon.&quot; And with that the door was slammed closed. </em></p>
<p><em>Mina  gulped the lump in her throat. She had someway realized what kind of  casting was that. In front of the desk stood a plain plastic chair, she  stared at it for a couple of minutes. She felt suddenly cold though the  hot summer day. She sat down and begun unbuttoning her sleeveless shirt  slowly, her fingers trembling slightly.</em></p>
<p><em>Then a wet  sensation on her hand startled her. She looked down and saw the  transparent drop sliding down the back of her hand and into the yellow  fabric of her shirt. She stared at the slowly enlarging stain until she  realized that was a tear. Her tear. Soon others followed and she broke  down sobbing.</em></p>
<p><em>A couple of moments later the others girls  waiting in the hall saw a blur of yellow rushing down the corridor and  towards the exit.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>&quot;You. It's your turn.&quot; The assistant shrugged then grabbed a dumbfounded brunette by the arm and escorted to the same room.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>&quot;Mina?  Mina? So? Isn't it your shirt? Isn't it your suitcase? It would be an  incredible luck to find it.&quot; Serena was showing Mina a yellow,  sleeveless shirt, &quot;I remember you having a shirt like this.&quot; The  pigtailed girl remembered right but Mina was absolutely sure that  wasn't her shirt. 'I thrown it away that same day...'</p>
<p>&quot;No Serena, that is <em>not</em> my shirt. Now let's move on, we're not supposed to search for clothing,  but for medications.&quot; She said returning to the large suitcase she was  rummaging.</p>
<p>The doctor had instructed them to search for any kind  of medications, sewer-kits, even every form of alcohol. She needed  mostly antibiotics particularly for Hotaru's father. She had said that  was the only tiny chance to maintain him alive until he could be  transported to an hospital.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, you're right. I think we should  hurry, too. I want to see Darien before they go... I still don't  understand how could the radio be functioning after the plane has  crashed.&quot; Serena mumbled and stood having finished searching a little  leather suitcase.</p>
<p>&quot;Furuhata said there's a supplemental transmitter on every plane for emergency.&quot; Mina replied.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  he seems to be an expert. Hey Mina, do you think he has a girlfriend?  'Cause he's nice and good-looking and I think you could...&quot; Her voice  faded off.</p>
<p>&quot;I could what? You should stop trying to set me up  with guys, it seems like you don't think I could get one myself.&quot; Mina  answered laughing. When she didn't hear any comment from her friend she  turned around.</p>
<p>Serena was incredibly pale and she was trembling.  Her light blue eyes shone from tears and were staring at the ground.  Mina followed her friend's look to what seemed to be a suit shoe. After  a moment she realized that there was a foot in that shoe and an entire  body attached to the foot. The <em>dead</em> body of a middle-age man in an elegant business suit.</p>
<p>&quot;We  should start considering taking care of those sooner or later.&quot; Was her  calm comment. She then kneeled down and searched the corpse's pocket.  &quot;Aha! I knew it!&quot; She took out of his coat's a little orange plastic  box half full of white pills. When she stood she looked to her  pigtailed friend.</p>
<p>Serena's eyes were wide, so was her gaping  mouth, and large tears was falling down her pale cheeks. She seemed  scared. Then the pigtailed girl jumped in Mina's arms crying.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  you're so brave Mina! You're so practical and brave! I wish I could be  strong like you!&quot; She said between sobs. Mina caressed her back  soothingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come on Serena, there's no need to cry for that!&quot; She tried to calm her friend.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  you're my idol, even since kindergarten. You are so strong and brave...  sob... and beautiful... and brilliant sob... and you're talented too.  You'll be a star. You've always been successful whatever you were  doing. sob And now you had the sense of doing that and take the  medication. I'll never be able to be like you.&quot; She concluded still  sobbing.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know what you're talking about, Serena. I  think you're a bit too emotional right now.&quot; She patted Serena's back  then added, changing the subject, &quot;I think we're finished here, let's  take these stuffs to Dr. Mizuno... then you have yet to give a good-bye  kiss to Darien. And you know what? I think I may be going with them.&quot;</p>
<p>'Cause you keep reminding me how a crappy lie my life is...' She added to herself.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Hey,  Four-eyes, I'm done here, I'll go to the doc for the deliver.&quot; The  long-haired, cold-eyed man told Umino while lifting a blue rucksack  almost full of every kind of things on his shoulder and headed to the  wood.
<p>&quot;Ok... Hey! Wait!&quot; The young Japanese called for him. He  stopped in his tracks, a cold bead of sweat ran down his spine. 'What  the Hell does the moron want, now?' He asked himself.</p>
<p>Umino came  running to him and panting he offered his right hand and said: &quot;Hey, we  never introduced one another. I'm Gurio Umino, nice to meet you.&quot;</p>
<p>The older man sweatdropped, he ignored the proffered hand and locked his cold eyes with the smiling face of the Japanese boy.</p>
<p>&quot;The  pleasure is all mine, Four-eyes.&quot; The tone was sarcastic but Umino's  smile didn't fade. Instead he looked at the older man waiting. After a  minute or so of unnerving silence the long-haired man gave up. &quot;It's  Jade, Four-eyes. Now get away, I have to go.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, yes. Please go ahead, Jade.&quot; Umino moved from Jade's path quickly and returned to his rummaging.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;I still don't know if I can trust you.&quot; Haruka said to her interlocutor, narrowing her teal eyes menacingly.
<p>&quot;There's nothing I can do now to make you trust me.&quot; The interlocutor's face was unreadable.</p>
<p>&quot;You're  damn right.&quot; Haruka said curtly, then she looked down at the purple  eyed little girl and her expression softened. &quot;Are you going to be  alright, Hime-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hai, Haruka-san. I'll be alright here with  Setsuna-mama. She's nice, you shouldn't be so rude to her. I like her  very much.&quot; The little girl said almost scolding.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh... if you  say so then I'll go. Be a good kid, and don't play too much when I'm  off.&quot; She said and winked to the waving child. Then she headed to the  hospital tent that they had designated as their head-quarter due to the  fact that the doctor couldn't leave the injured Souchi Tomoe – that was  Hotaru's father's name.</p>
<p>When she reached the tent Lita, the  brunette who had came to her earlier, Furuhata, the blonde man who was  supposed to be able to find and use the transmitter, Michiru, Seiya and  Yaten, Seiya's younger brother, were ready to go and find the plane's  cockpit. She went to meet the approaching Darien and she realized he  wasn't alone. The pretty blonde girl with the red ribbon was with him.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey Haruka, are we ready?&quot; He greeted her with a serious look.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh, yes, we were waiting for you... emh... before we go can I talk to you... in private.&quot; She added glancing shortly at Mina.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  yes. Of course. Mina can you excuse us a minute?&quot; He asked gently. Mina  nodded without objecting and went ahead towards the others.</p>
<p>&quot;We still don't know who was with the Marshall, you have any clue?&quot; Haruka said looking seriously at Darien's blue eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;No, and I'm not too happy to leave Serena here, but we have to do this thing...&quot; Darien confessed her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, I know.&quot; She glanced briefly to the spot in the distance where she had left Hotaru with Setsuna.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  let's keep our eyes open and try to be back as soon as possible.&quot; He  concluded with resolve on his face. Haruka nodded and they reached the  group at the tent.</p>
<p>There they met the long-haired man who had survived with them. He had half-a-dozen little box of medications in his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to try and use the cockpit's transmitter to send an S.O.S. Are you going with us?&quot; Darien asked him friendly.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  thanks. It's a total waste of time and energies. If they wanted to find  us they would be here already.&quot; Was the not so friendly reply.</p>
<p>At  his bitter words all the head went up, a couple of pair of eyes watered  and hands begun trembling. Someone even started to murmur their  despair. And silence fell upon them like a suffocating coat. Haruka  snapped out of it first and glared at the long-haired man, her eyes  cold like ice.</p>
<p>&quot;That's why we're going. If they're not here could  it be cause they don't know already. We'll tell them.&quot; All the heads  turned towards who had the hopeful and positive speech.</p>
<p>Furuhata.</p>
<p>The  blonde man was already heading toward the forest with a confident smile  on his lips. The group soon followed him dismissing Jade and his words.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
So begun their journey to the point where a thin column of smoke could be seen in the distance.
<p>The  trip was quite hard cause the path was unbeaten and the wood was pretty  thick. For the first hour they walked in silence, the tension almost  concrete amid them. They didn't knew each others and Jade's words still  echoed in most of the components' thoughts. The only one who seemed  confident and optimistic was Furuhata who was also guiding the group  with a steady pace.</p>
<p>But soon the silence became too much for Mina  to stand, the dark thoughts that had tormented her lately were eating  into her mind painfully. She spotted the three figures walking a couple  of meters ahead of her and reached them. She had recognized them  immediately but the events had kept her from approaching them. Now she  put on her most charming smile and swayed her hips out of habit  accelerating her pace towards them.</p>
<p>&quot;You know, even in this crazy  circumstances it's amazing. I'm a huge fan of yours.&quot; She said when she  was beside Yaten, who was really her favorite with his beautiful sense  of fashion and his cool manners.</p>
<p>The sudden breaking of silence  startled Yaten. He looked at his left and saw the pretty blonde girl he  had seen before with Darien and his girlfriend. He smiled at her happy  that someone would made them snap out of that heavy and quite scary  atmosphere.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, thank Kami someone had recognized us. I was  starting to think we're not as famous as our agent thinks.&quot; He smiled  and said joking – or was he not?</p>
<p>&quot;How could you doubt our success, lil' brother? You'll be <em>always</em> popular with a cool and incredibly handsome brother like me!&quot; Seiya intervened winking at the pretty girl.</p>
<p>Michiru  and Yaten rolled their eyes while Mina blinked trying to understand if  he was joking or not. But after a few seconds and one of Seiya's  patented smiles she concluded it didn't matter cause he was right  anyway.</p>
<p>That first try at talking seemed to dissipate the heavy  silence for the whole group and within minutes Lita, Furuhata and  Darien were talking too. Only Haruka remained silent at the end of the  group.</p>
<p>As Seiya was completely engrossed in the conversation with  their adoring fan Michiru considered that was the perfect moment to  sneak away from them. And just when the blonde girl was telling about  her promising carrier in the show-biz Michiru slowed her pace to make  them go ahead.</p>
<p>While she waited for them to be far enough she  asked herself why she was so willing to be with someone else. After all  they were her travel-mates, her friends and colleagues, they were  supposed to understand her and be the perfect company for her. And they  indeed were a good company. Yaten had a good sense of fashion and she  had been happy to have a competent partner for her shopping  expeditions. Taiki was a real gentleman, cultured, kind and  sophisticated. And Seiya... Seiya was handsome and brilliant, kind and  charming. He was very talented and this was something she had always  searched in her friends cause that was part of the 'freak-attitude'  that had tormented her lonely childhood. Everybody had always been  admired, scared or envious of her talent but nobody had ever been able  to really understand her.</p>
<p>She saved her internal considerations for later on and approached the handsome blonde at the end of the little expedition group.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey you there! All alone and brooding...&quot; The aqua-haired woman said with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Brooding?  I don't brood!&quot; The blonde mumbled back then she lifted her eyes to  meet Michiru's. The smile that greeted her was one to take one's breath  away. It was slightly amused, a little concerned and with a tinge of  tenderness that evidently Michiru had been unable to hide.</p>
<p>&quot;What?  I have something on my face?&quot; Michiru tilted her head a little,  searching her own face with one hand. After a moment Haruka realized  that she was staring and dismissed her thoughts quickly, without giving  her mind enough time to consider the implications.</p>
<p>&quot;No, you have  nothing on your face. So, aren't you entertaining your fan?&quot; She  replied quickly shifting Michiru's attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>Michiru  was surprised by Haruka's comment and wasn't able to hide that fact.  She stared at the tall blonde dumbfounded until Haruka's laugh got her  attention.</p>
<p>&quot;What? Don't you know you're famous?&quot; Haruka's  amusement was evident in her bright teal eyes and Michiru considered  for a moment how beautiful those eyes were when the blonde's smile  reached them.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course I'm aware of that... painfully aware,  actually. It's just that you don't seem to be someone who's fond of  music, especially pop-music.&quot; She replied honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I'm  not... fond of pop-music. And you neither.&quot; That was a statement, not a  question. &quot;You wouldn't play the violin for pop-music.&quot; She explained,  then added, &quot;But though I don't like pop-music I know who those three  are... and though you don't like pop-music you play with them.&quot; There  was something bitter in her sentence, particularly in the last words.  Both of them noticed that and both were surprised at the tone. Even  Haruka herself.</p>
<p>For a couple of minutes an awkward silence fell  between them. Haruka was scolding herself for her tone and tried not to  ask herself why she had said that that way. Michiru, on the other end,  was surprised the blonde knew so many things about her present career.</p>
<p>&quot;I  noticed...&quot; Michiru spoke first, &quot;I noticed your Japanese is flawless  but so it's your English. Where are you from exactly?&quot; That wasn't just  to interrupt the silence between them, Michiru was sincerely curious  about the blonde, she felt like wanting to know all about her and she  had found herself compelled to ask.</p>
<p>Haruka remained silent for a  minute, deciding about answering or not. She didn't like to talk about  herself, particularly with someone she had just met. But the  aqua-haired girl had a weird and pretty scary effect on her and without  realizing she found herself answering shortly but sincerely.</p>
<p>&quot;Technically I'm American.&quot; She stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh.&quot;</p>
<p>The  aqua-haired woman seemed almost disappointed at that and Haruka quickly  added, &quot;But I lived more than half my life in Japan, so... I think I'm  more Japanese than American.&quot; The last words were spoken with gravity  and Michiru thought someway they had to have a special meaning for the  tall blonde. Haruka didn't continued talking and Michiru sensed she  wasn't comfortable with that subject so she shifted to a less personal  topic.</p>
<p>&quot;So what do you do for a living?&quot; The body language of the  tall blonde proved Michiru's thought to be right. Haruka relaxed  visibly and answered more quickly at this one.</p>
<p>&quot;I work in the  sports system... motor-sports.&quot; At that her teal eyes sparkled with  passion and Michiru was once more captivated by that look. She wasn't  surprised by the fact the blonde worked in a field made for men, it  suited her perfectly and nothing of that seemed out of place. But a  slight sense of uneasiness at the back of her mind prevented Michiru to  be completely comfortable. When she was about to speak out another  question Haruka anticipated her.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, why I'm the only one  giving out all the personal information?&quot; She had said the words  playfully and Michiru liked that a lot.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause you don't ask anything, and cause you seem to already know a lot about me.&quot; Michiru replied equally playful.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  it's hard not to know you, you're on all the newspapers. You seem to be  the favorite subject of photographers lately... and they can't be  blamed for that... beautiful and talented.&quot; The smile that followed  those words was one of incredible charm. Michiru blushed furiously at  the flattering comment. The flirtatious attitude of the blonde had  struck straight to Michiru's heart which skipped a beat sending a  shiver through her system.</p>
<p>A blushing and giggling Michiru was  what met Seiya's eyes when he reached the end of the group searching  for her. That image was so different from the always composed and aloof  Michiru he knew. The initial surprise faded off and was replaced by a  sense of annoyance that was once more caused by the presence of the  tall blonde.</p>
<p>With a renewed resolve the dark-haired boy grabbed  Michiru's arm and interrupted them abruptly. &quot;Can I talk to you for a  minute, <em>Michi-chan</em>?&quot; He stressed the extremely intimate  nickname he addressed her with and the cold look he received back from  the aqua-haired beauty told him that had been a mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya-san,  what do you want?&quot; She kept herself for openly scolding him cause she  hated to make scenes in front of an audience, but the temptation was  strong.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I talk to you in private, please?&quot; His attitude had changed after her look and she took that as a silent apology.</p>
<p>&quot;Excuse me, Haruka-san.&quot; She said to the suddenly cold-eyed blonde. Haruka nodded and she let Seiya pull her ahead.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; He asked her accusingly.</p>
<p>&quot;What are <em>you</em> doing?&quot; She replied shooting him a glare with her stormy blue eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Do you know <em>that</em> is a <em>woman</em>?&quot; He asked whispering and stressing the 'that'.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course I do, I'm not blind nor stupid!&quot; She replied angrily. &quot;And why  this would be a problem?&quot; She then asked, she didn't understand why he  was so upset. Was he jealous? 'No it can't be, we're not dating, beside  there's nothing to be jealous of, is there?' Michiru thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause she-...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There! It's there!&quot; Furuhata's excited shout cut Seiya's and all the others' sentences off.</p>
<p>The  group stopped and all of them looked where the blonde man was pointing.  In front of them there was the plane's cockpit, actually there was what  it remained of it. It had crashed deep into the wood, tress were  crashed under it and even if they had cushioned the fall some of them  had passed through the airframe. So what was before their eyes was a  bloody, impaled metal carrion. A thin column of smoke blew upon it but  there was no fire.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Darien  and Haruka exchanged a couple of ideas while the others were still  taking in the sight of that catastrophe. Then Darien cleared his throat  and addressed everybody.
<p>&quot;Haruka and Furuhata will reach the pilot's  cabin to try and find the transmitter, the others will look for anybody  still alive.&quot; He couldn't hide the skeptical tone in the last words.</p>
<p>Though the instructions had been already given nobody moved. It was Lita who stepped in first after a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God...&quot; They all heard when she was inside.</p>
<p>&quot;What? What's in there?&quot; Yaten said very anxious.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you think it's in there, baka!&quot; Seiya asked sarcastic then he followed Lita in the airframe.</p>
<p>After them was Darien's and Mina's turn and then Michiru's. Yaten had remained outside but nobody seemed to have noticed that.</p>
<p>Haruka  and Furuhata had circled the nose of the plane to see if they could  enter the cockpit another way. Part of the glass of the nose was  shattered and Furuhata tried to make it through that but he couldn't  find anything to grab and pull himself in. He remained dangling half in  and half out until Haruka with her good arm pushed him inside from  below.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you!&quot; Came Furuhata's muffled voice from the cockpit. Then he gasped.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  Haruka asked and not receiving any answer, &quot;I can't get inside from  here, I'm coming in from the other side!&quot; She said and she hurried back  around the nose.</p>
<p>Once inside the airframe the sight was dreadful.  Corpses were everywhere. Some still tucked in their seats some  discarded around. One was even impaled by a branch. But what was really  shocking was the amount of blood, too much blood even for a crash down  of that proportion.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka I need a hand here!&quot; Furuhata called, snapping her out of her dazed state.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm coming.&quot; She said but it was just a whisper. She made it to the cockpit without looking back to the others.</p>
<p>Michiru  had a hand on her mouth completely in shock, Lita was panting hard  trying not to throw up, Darien had his eyes closed and was silently  praying, Seiya with his trembling hands covering his eyes. Mina was the  only one who – though shaken – tried to check on some of the corpses.  She didn't say anything, just looked around passing by her shocked  companions and searching for the victims' pulse points. Her eyes were  full of tears but she didn't gave up to the horror of that deadly sight.</p>
<p>Meanwhile  in the cockpit Furuhata was already searching for the transmitter. He  had tried to move the pilot's seat but it was too heavy cause the  pilot's body was still buckled on it.</p>
<p>&quot;It should be right under  it.&quot; He said to the blonde once she was in. He glanced at her only for  a moment but he saw she was particularly pale and her eyes were wide.  &quot;Tenoh-san? What's happened?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka didn't answered, she tried  to move the pilot's seat with her right arm but it was impossible.  Furuhata saw her gesture and forgot his question, he joined the blonde  woman's efforts. Then they decided to unbuckle the body and try to move  it out of the way first. They did it but when they were moving him they  heard a soft moan.</p>
<p>&quot;Shimatta! He's alive!&quot; They laid him down carefully.</p>
<p>&quot;Run! cough... run, hurry! It'll come back!&quot; The badly injured pilot said anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  it's ok we're here. We'll take you to a doctor. There's a doctor with  us at the beach.&quot; Furuhata tried to reassure the pilot but he was very  agitated.</p>
<p>&quot;Hurry, take the emergency transmitter... cough...&quot; a  trickle of blood came out of his mouth. &quot;They... they... cough... don't  know... cough out of path...cough cough... thousand miles out of  path... it hasn't finished yet... cough... it will... back... hurry...  thousand miles... its teeth...&quot; It was more and more difficult for the  dying man to speak and his words became less and less intelligible. He  coughed one more time then he went completely limp with his empty eyes  wide open and pointing at the ceiling. Haruka then looked at Furuhata  and shook her head. After a moment of silence she spoke.</p>
<p>&quot;Come  on, we have a job to do.&quot; They continued searching under the pilot's  seat and after a minute or so Furuhata stood triumphantly.</p>
<p>&quot;I have it!&quot; He had a black transmitter in his hand.</p>
<p>GROAR!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Legs...&quot;  Seiya said with trembling voice. &quot;Where are her legs?&quot; Completely in  shock he was pointing at a woman whose legs were missing.
<p>&quot;Oh my God,  ohmygod... ohmaygoohmygod...&quot; Said Lita looking around at the bloody  mess, the corpses seemed to be literally devoured. Michiru fumbled  having slipped on the blood covering the ground and almost lost her  equilibrium. Darien was already walking out with Mina cause obviously  no one was alive in there.</p>
<p>GROAR!</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
GROAR!
<p>The  airframe shook hard and all of them fell to the ground. After a moment  of surprise Haruka and Furuhata was out of the cockpit and with the  others. They were all silent and panting heavily.</p>
<p>GROAR!</p>
<p>Again  the plane's structure shook heavily, the noise seemed to come from the  cockpit and Haruka who was closer couldn't help but peek over the seats  and in the cabin. She saw the pilot's body being pulled out through the  half shattered glass, then she gasped when a big splash of crimson  squashed on the part of the glass still unbroken.</p>
<p>Michiru saw  Haruka and lifted to look over the blonde's shoulder to see what had  made her flinch but Haruka promptly grabbed her and pulled her against  her chest preventing the aqua-haired girl from seeing that horror.</p>
<p>&quot;No! Don't...&quot; The blonde murmured. Michiru remained still, Haruka's heart beating fast under her ear.</p>
<p>Then  suddenly as it came whatever it was was gone, only their hard breathing  was audible in the silence. They exchanged scared looks and slowly one  after another they stood.</p>
<p>&quot;Kami-sama Yaten!&quot; Seiya stood abruptly  turning back and forth, and realizing his brother wasn't there with  them. He ran out of the cabin.</p>
<p>&quot;SEIYA NO!&quot; Michiru too stood from  Haruka's lap and ran after her friend. The blonde wanted to run after  Michiru but with her right arm stuck against a seat and the other in  the hand-made sling she wasn't able to stand, so she disengaged her  left arm from the handkerchief and stood wincing.</p>
<p>In a minute all  of them were out of the cabin despite the danger. Seiya was calling for  his brother out loud. They split to look for the missing man in more  directions. After a couple of minute of frenzy searching. Michiru had a  glimpse of silver among some dark bushes. There crouched with his back  to her was a heavily shaking Yaten. She got close to the trembling form  and crouched behind him.</p>
<p>&quot;Yaten-chan?&quot; She addressed softly at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Kami-sama help me...&quot; He was murmuring, seemingly he hadn't acknowledged her friend's presence.</p>
<p>&quot;Shh...  it's over. It's gone, calm now. Here...&quot; And with that she embraced her  terrified friend from behind trying to soothe him.</p>
<p>Haruka who was  searching nearby reached them. When she saw the scene she simply stood  there in silence understanding her presence could upset the already  distressed boy. While standing there she couldn't help but consider how  sweet Michiru was in that circumstances, she wasn't just the elegant  and snob talented beauty the newspapers pictured her.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a dashing Seiya who run to the two crouched figures.</p>
<p>&quot;You  ok? It didn't hurt you?&quot; The silver-haired man just nodded. Michiru  then stood leaving Yaten in his brother's care, she turned and her look  crossed Haruka's concerned one. The aqua-haired girl someway understood  what the blonde was thinking and touched Seiya's shoulder to get his  attention.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not safe to remain here, we better go.&quot; She said  that very softly and Seiya nodded standing and pulling his brother with  him.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
After an hour at a  rather fast pace they reached the top of a hill that was clear of trees  and from where they could see the beach in the distance. They decided  to spend the night there cause no one wanted to walk through the woods  in the dark. And the sun had already set.
<p>Furuhata was checking on  the transmitter while the others sat around the fire they had lit with  Lita's lighter. They sat in silence at first then someone started to  talk to ease the tension. No one wanted to talk about the horror they  had seen in the afternoon so they just talked about trivial subjects.</p>
<p>&quot;You  know Mina, I never thanked you for coming with us in Japan. It meant a  lot for Serena.&quot; Said Darien tossing little branches into the fire. He  was sat with Mina and Lita, the tall brunette.</p>
<p>&quot;No need to thank  me, Darien, it was fun. Besides I won't spend a lot of time with Serena  anymore in the future. I just took my chance.&quot; Mina replied with a  tinge of sadness.</p>
<p>&quot;I know...&quot; The dark-haired man dropped his gaze obviously troubled. Mina saw that and tried to reassure him.</p>
<p>&quot;I  will be too busy anyway, you know. This Broadway-thing will have me  full-time. Rehearsal all day long and parties every night. It'll be  hard life.&quot; She concluded laughing. Even for her own ears that laugh  resounded exaggerate, fake. 'Like the bullshit I'm saying...' she told  to herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm glad you made it, that was your dream.&quot; He  smiled at her sweetly. He was sincerely glad for her and that knowledge  was like a stabbing in her heart.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot; She faltered for just a moment, but soon her patented smile took its place on her pretty face.</p>
<p>&quot;Serena  is so proud of you. She hangs around bragging about her successful  best-friend all the time. That's her. She can be completely happy for  someone else without the smallest bit of enviousness.&quot; His blue eyes  became dreamy at the thought of his fiancée.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, she's amazing. She should be proud of herself most of all... of her life. So real, so truthful... So honest.&quot;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Good Miss Aino, we'll contact you... The next one! Come on! We don't have time to waste, ladies.&quot;</em>
<p><em>She  picked up her score the pianist lent back to her and was out of the  theater in a minute. It has been the tenth audition of that week and  every time it was a 'we'll contact you' but no more contacting. Every </em>damn<em> time.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Mina! Mina!&quot; A panting Serena reached her on her way to the subway.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Serena, what are you doing here?&quot; Mina asked her friend when she had calmed a little.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  wanted to make you a surprise for your audition. I know how important  it is for you.&quot; The pigtailed girl said with an open smile.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You're  too sweet to be true, Serena. Let's go for an ice-cream, my treat.&quot;  Mina was glad her friend was there with her. She was always her  support, even if it could seem the other way around. Sure Serena was  clumsy and childish, but she was always positive and her happiness was  contagious. And you could always count on her presence. For Serena  friendship was something sacred.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes! Ice-cream! Wait...  your treat? You mean we're celebrating! Oh my God Mina, you made it!&quot;  The pigtailed girl hugged her friend in a dead-grip embrace almost  lifting her from the ground. &quot;I knew it! I knew you would have made it!  You're too talented.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Mina was taken aback by Serena's  enthusiasm. Her friend was so happy that tears had already started to  form in her light blue eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Calm down Serena! It's not like that-...&quot; She started but the other girl interrupted her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What  do you mean? The audition went bad?&quot; Her face fell and all her  happiness was replaced by such sadness and disappointment that Mina  couldn't help but...</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Sure it went good! No, I mean it was </em>greatI<em> was great! A performance Oscar-worthy. It's just that... we still  haven't had our debut. Us actors are superstitious, you know. Now let's  go celebrate.&quot; Then they went into a café and ordered for the biggest  ice cream they had.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>&quot;To Mina, the best actress! Nicole  Kidman be ware, the great Mina is coming!&quot; Serena said and with their  two little spoons high in the hair they cheered loud so that everyone  in the room turned toward them. They laughed and ate their ice-creams  happily.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>'Sure  that was the best performance ever. Yeah... I'm a very good actress.'  Mina thought returning her attention to the current conversation  between Darien and Lita.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Seiya  didn't want to leave Yaten's side even if the silver-haired man seemed  to be back to normal, he didn't shake anymore and was even trying to  lighten the mood for himself and for the others mainly for Seiya who  was very concerned. After a while Michiru walked to Haruka.
<p>&quot;Don't tell me you're not brooding now.&quot; Said Michiru playfully and sat down beside the blonde.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you before, I don't brood... I think very hard!&quot; The answer was equally playful and both relaxed a little.</p>
<p>&quot;Ara,  I didn't intend to interrupt all that hard thinking, please go on, your  expression is pretty entertaining itself.&quot; Playfulness was something  deeply rooted in her personality but somehow it had been always hushed  up by herself or others. Now, despite the desperate situation Michiru  felt good in the blonde's company. She enjoyed teasing the blonde and  she enjoyed the complicity that seemed to exist between them.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, now I'm an entertainer. Do you like the show?&quot; Haruka asked winking but was taken aback by the husky reply.</p>
<p>&quot;Very  much.&quot; Michiru said that with a low, sultry voice. She didn't know what  had possessed her. She had intended to be just playful but what came  out of her mouth was something flirtatious if not kind of... sexy.</p>
<p>Haruka  did something she rarely let happen. She blushed. She wasn't new at  flirting, right the contrary. She considered flirting with pretty girls  like a hobby. Sweet words, compliments, kissing hands or little  gestures of gallantry were like a second nature for her. She always  displayed her charming smile and every pretty girl in the neighborhood  was falling for her. But she never was the prey.</p>
<p>'And you  certainly aren't now!' A voice scolded in her head. 'There's no way she  intended more than teasing you. She's straight and she's probably  dating that moron.' Her internal voice was right, or so she convinced  herself.</p>
<p>Michiru was so surprised seeing the deep crimson  ascending from the blonde's neck to her cheeks that she chuckled softly  and hardly kept herself from laughing out loud. She recomposed herself  only when a scolding glare of those teal eyes pierced her.</p>
<p>They  remained in silence for a while looking into the fire before them. The  light moment was over and dark thoughts returned to haunt their mind.  Haruka replayed in her head the mysterious words of the pilot. They  were 1000 miles out of their path and the rescue squad was probably  searching for them somewhere else. Michiru on the other hand was trying  to shut out of her mind the sight of those devoured bodies and the  tactile sensation of the blood under her feet.</p>
<p>That was the  reason cause the violinist wanted to resume some form of conversation,  she had to keep her mind occupied. She then looked at Haruka and found  her massaging her sore shoulder and just then she realized the  handkerchief intended to prevent movements of the injured limb was  missing.</p>
<p>&quot;You shouldn't move that, you know?&quot; Michiru said then.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not moving it, beside it's just a little sore.&quot; Haruka stopped her  action and turned to look at Furuhata who was sit across of her. &quot;Has  he made it? I don't like this waiting.&quot; She said trying to change the  subject.</p>
<p>&quot;We have the whole night to wait anyway.&quot; Michiru considered calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot;  Haruka's short reply surely hid more. Something was bothering the  blonde and it wasn't just the past happenings, Michiru could sense  that. 'Is she scared about the... thing? Or is it something else?' Then  Michiru realized what seemed to be Haruka's main concern since she had  met her after the crash-down. Hotaru.</p>
<p>&quot;You're worried about Hotaru-chan.&quot; It was a statement not a question.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm fine.&quot; The blonde had become laconic.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh...&quot; Michiru looked at Haruka with a skeptical glance and the blonde noticed that.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok. Yes, I'm concerned about her. She's there and I'm not.&quot; Was the simple answer.</p>
<p>&quot;But she's with Setsuna-san, isn't she?&quot; Michiru tried to reassure her.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah...&quot; Another laconic answer.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't trust her.&quot; Silence followed Michiru's statement until Haruka explained herself.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  not used to trust people I just met.&quot; Haruka never looked at Michiru  instead she looked into the fire, the flames reflecting in her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course... Actually you don't seem the kind of person to trust people in  general.&quot; The violinist spoke softly cause she already knew that  personal issues weren't comfortable for the blonde. And the lacking of  a reply was proof of that.</p>
<p>The silence lasted for long minutes.  The chatter of the others and the crackling noises of Furuhata's  efforts of making the transmitter work seemed far from them, just a dim  background. Michiru felt suddenly cold. She sensed Haruka was trying to  reestablish some distance between the two of them and she didn't like  that. So she made a risky move, she needed reassurance even if she  didn't understand why.</p>
<p>&quot;And what about me?... Do you trust me?&quot;  The words were spoken softly but with heavy seriousness. Haruka turned  to look at her for the first time and what Michiru saw in those eyes  left her confused. It wasn't annoyance, nor scolding for her  intrusiveness, like she had expected. It was... 'Fear! What are you  scared of? It is me? It can't be me, I don't <em>scare </em>people, do I?' The violinist thought. Then she shook her head. 'You are a real mystery Haruka Tenoh...'</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka?&quot;</p>
<p>Fortunately for Haruka, Furuhata called for her and she had an easy way out of the soon-to-become-emotional conversation.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Michiru  was left alone with her thoughts. And she remained there for a couple  of minutes until she felt someone sitting beside her. She smiled  thinking it was Haruka again, but when she opened her eyes and looked  at her left she saw two clear blue eyes and Mina's pretty face. Her  smile faded for a moment, then not to being impolite returned maybe a  little smaller than before.
<p>&quot;You were expecting someone else.&quot; Was  Mina's amused statement. She smiled without bitterness. &quot;I can't blame  you. You have such a taste for handsome and talented people. But then  again you are beautiful and talented too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot; You're very kind. Thank you. And I was told you're a talented actress, too.&quot; Michiru replied, her smile growing.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh  well, yeah. I...&quot; she swallowed, &quot;Yeah, I actually... Oh, never mind!  We were talking about you... you lucky you.&quot; Said Mina with a very  large smile. She had just won a little battle against herself.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh...  so tell me, why am I lucky?&quot; Michiru asked chuckling. That girl was  funny with her fan-attitude but not too reverential. She has a good  charm and Michiru thought she could really reach success in the  star-business where a pretty face, charm and freshness could be  rewarded more than talent alone.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, look at yourself, you're  beautiful! And you're not even stupid!&quot; Mina said a little too loud.  Michiru's eyes went wide but she soon burst out in laughter, tears in  her eyes. Mina blushed and quickly apologized. &quot;Oh, sorry. But you got  what I meant, didn't you?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I got it. And I think that was  really a compliment.&quot; The violinist replied after recomposing herself a  little, but still smiling brightly.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, and you're with them  all the time. They're so different but so charming...&quot; Mina's blue eyes  were dreamy, &quot;Ok, Seiya is more my type, if you know what I mean...&quot;  She winked at the dazed violinist then continued &quot;...but you can never  know what life has in store for you. Besides, in my opinion you have to  experience everything but incest and willing chastity.&quot; The blonde girl  concluded forming a 'V' with her index and middle fingers.</p>
<p>Michiru wasn't sure to have understood what Mina was meaning but smiled anyway even just for the last sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought Yaten was your favorite. It seemed so, earlier in the woods.&quot; Michiru said honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course Yaten is my favorite! He's so elegant and handsome and his voice  is... heavenly!&quot; At those words Michiru sweatdropped, but her confusion  grew.</p>
<p>&quot;But you just said Seiya...&quot; Then Mina understood and her eyes went wide in surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;You thought I was referring to Yaten and Seiya... don't tell me... Oh my God, you don't know who is she!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What? Who?&quot; Michiru asked, Mina's exclamations didn't help her to understand what the hell she was talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't know much about sports, do you?&quot; Mina asked her.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  no. Actually I don't know anything about sports. Even if I was in the  swimming team back in high school.&quot; Michiru answered honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, and you don't read gossip magazines neither, I guess.&quot; Mina said skeptically.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes,  I have to when my agent make me. He want me to know all the things they  write about me, but I hate all those stuffs. They're mostly bullshit by  the way.&quot; She said sighing.</p>
<p>&quot;So you don't have any idea who Haruka Tenoh is.&quot; Mina said, every word pronounced slow in a theatrical way.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I'm afraid not, but now that I think about it... when we were  boarding... Of course! She was signing an autograph, that was the  reason the hostess were so excited even before seeing the Threelights.&quot;  Michiru replayed that moment in her head and realized the hostesses  were talking about Haruka when they had said that that was their lucky  day.</p>
<p>&quot;She's the world Formula One champion. The first woman  car-racer to win in the hardest category of motor-sports! She's an idol  and a model for every girl in the world and even for many boys.&quot; Mina  said like she was a sponsor.</p>
<p>Michiru looked at Haruka across of  her sat helping Furuhata with the transmitter and thought: 'I wasn't  expecting anything less from you, Haruka Tenoh...'</p>
<p>Mina saw the smile on the beautiful violinist's face and smiled herself. There was something going on, that was for sure.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;I've  got it! I've got it!&quot; Furuhata's excited shout got everybody's  attention even if in his frenzy he had exclaimed that in Japanese. Then  he talked in the transmitter in English. &quot;May day! May day! Is someone  receiving? May day! A plane crashed!&quot; He released the transmitting  button to hear a possible response, but nothing happened. The others  had gathered around him all in silence and all hoping to hear something.
<p>Then, like someone – possibly God or Kami – had heard their silent prayers a voice came out of the little black transmitter.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Doctor,  the baits are already in the garden. And Teddy had already had his  first meal. We're waiting for further instructions.&quot; </em>A clear male voice said.</p>
<p><em>&quot;Ok,  good job. Come back home. For today you're off. Now we just have to  wait for them to... bzz...plbzzzzzz...it'll...bzzzzzzz...fun...  bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz-&quot;</em> The female's voice was cut off when the signal  disappeared. They remained dumbfounded, that wasn't obviously the  answer to their S.O.S.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Hell was all that about?&quot; Lita inquired looking at Furuhata. He shook his head dazed.</p>
<p>&quot;I  don't know... it seems like we had received unintentionally someone  else's transmission. But... it was very clear at the beginning.&quot; He  added thoughtful.</p>
<p>&quot;And what does that mean?&quot; Darien asked anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it could be they are pretty close.&quot; Furuhata answered.</p>
<p>&quot;If  it is so, then why did it go all 'buzzing' and then it went off?&quot; Seiya  asked skeptical. All seven pairs of eyes was on Furuhata. He swallowed  suddenly self-conscious.</p>
<p>&quot;Ehm... it clearly is a private channel  so no one other than the owner and the designated receiver is supposed  to intercept it. I think our transmitter has changed frequency to  search for the regular international channel like it is programed.  During the shifting it had passed through their channel.&quot; They were all  convinced. &quot;But I can say it could be transmitted from some place close  to us.&quot; The blonde man said firmly.</p>
<p>&quot;How close? You mean on this island? ...If it <em>is</em> an island.&quot; Yaten asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Close in order of <em>kilometers</em>.&quot;  All eyes looked at him full of hope then he added, &quot;...hundreds  kilometers.&quot; He smiled apologetically like it was his fault. They all  sighed in disappointment and returned to their seats around the fire.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think it's better trying to get a bit of sleep if we want to come back  to the beach early in the morning.&quot; Mina said practically.</p>
<p>&quot;Like we are in any rush...&quot; Seiya murmured bitterly in Japanese for just Michiru's and Yaten's hearing.</p>
<p>They  all settled for the night, they even decided to take guard-shifts.  Furuhata drew Haruka to a secluded spot with an excuse, when they were  alone he spoke anxiously.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to tell 'em.&quot; The blonde man was very nervous.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; Haruka asked even if she had already guessed what he was talking about.</p>
<p>&quot;What  the pilot said. That we're out of path, that probably they're searching  for us in another place... a thousand miles far from here.&quot; He said  almost desperately.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Furuhata-kun, you have to calm down.  Listen to me. If we say that to them it will be panic. And if that's  true and we'll have to spend a long time here, do you think that panic  could be helpful in any way?&quot; She said calmly but firmly. She bent  slightly to be at the man's eye-level and took his shoulder in her  hands even if her left arm protested painfully.</p>
<p>After a moment  Furuhata shook his head in surrender. &quot;You're right Haruka-san. Hope  could be the only thing we could count on in the future.&quot; He said that  with a little spark in his eyes, then he smiled at her and said, &quot;Ok,  we should rest now, it has been a pretty intense day, hasn't it?&quot;  Haruka chuckled at the last remark.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I guess it has been.  Come on.&quot; And with that they reached the fire and while Furuhata laid  down Haruka sit near the fire to take the first guard-shift.</p>
<p>No  one of them could get any sleep that night. Some expecting to hear a  horrible roar any moment, some thinking about their life, some cause  every time they closed their eyes they saw a bloody mess, some  replaying over and over terrible words that stole every ounce of hope  from them and some cause every time they closed their eyes an other  pair of ocean blue eyes haunted them.</p>
