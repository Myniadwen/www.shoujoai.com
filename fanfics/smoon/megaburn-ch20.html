<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 20 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/megaburn-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Inferno Five

In the city of Megatokyo, madness and chaos ruled, but
there were still those that fought valiantly against
it&#39;s reign. Guns blazing AD Police forces fought to
drive back the rabid boomers, the inhumanly strong
creations of men slaughtering indiscriminately across
the city, attacking in incredible numbers.

&quot;Dead Scream!&quot; Sailor Pluto cried, the green and white
clad sailor soldier cried, her staff blazing as she
blasted another boomer to ash as she and the others
valiantly tried to hold the line.

&quot;There&#39;s no end to them,&quot; Saionji cried, the green
haired former duelist fighting bravely by her side.

Suddenly there was a blast of golden light and Sailor
Moon swept the mob with her scepter&#39;s attack, but more
and more boomers raced forward to almost instantly
fill up the space she cut into their ranks. &quot;Give me a
moment,&quot; Sailor Moon leaned on Utena&#39;s arm tiredly as
she continued, &quot;and I&#39;ll try again.&quot;

Breaking out of a alley congested with boomers a band
of survivors raced for the safety of their defensive
line, lead by two very similar yet different figures.
Mamoru, in his prince incarnation, slashed and ripped
through their foes as Anthy struck with her roses and
swift blows and the green Knight Saber used her cables
and fists to splatter boomers, eventually crossing the
line to safety.

&quot;Any luck?&quot; Sailor Uranus asked, the sandy blonde
haired woman using her Star Sword to devastating
effect against their seemingly endless foes.

&quot;There may be no more survivors out there,&quot; Mamoru
reported grimly, &quot;thank god we got most of the people
we saved out of the city.&quot;

&quot;You all right?&quot; Sylia Stingray asked, the helm of her
Knight Saber armor sitting beside her as she worked to
repair Priss&#39; arm cannon.

&quot;It&#39;s terrible out there,&quot; Linna murmured, &quot;the
boomers... they&#39;ve destroyed everything.&quot;

&quot;Not everything,&quot; Skuld answered, the black haired
younger woman still wearing the pink hardsuit, &quot;we&#39;re
alive, and we&#39;re saving lives. That is what&#39;s
important.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Priss nodded. She looked over at the still
busily working Sylia, &quot;Why did you take off your
helmet, by the way?&quot;

Sylia smiled slightly, her silvery hair gleaming. &quot;If
we lose, it won&#39;t matter,&quot; she noted, &quot;and if we win,
I deal with it then.&quot;

Hefting a impressive rifle a young woman stood with a
band of AD police officers, offering supportive fire
against the horde. &quot;Thanks for letting me join you,&quot;
Yohko said, hefting the massive rifle with surprising
ease.

&quot;We need all the help we can get,&quot; Nene Romanova said
bleakly, the smaller woman&#39;s eyes grim and strangely
dead.

Helping bandage a nearby officer&#39;s severed leg Sailor
Mercury looked up to meet Nene&#39;s eyes. &quot;We don&#39;t know
if they were hurt,&quot; the blue haired woman reminded
her, &quot;Mackie and the others may still be all right out
there.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Nene murmured...

...right before the whole city seemed to shake, what
almost felt like a tremor moving through the Earth.
&quot;Is it a &#145;quake?&quot; Sailor Mars demanded, the raven
haired woman burning a boomer with a wave of her hand.

&quot;Can&#39;t be,&quot; Sailor Mercury activated her visor and
began scanning their surroundings, &quot;Megatokyo was
built to absorb and resist them.&quot; She paused,
digesting the reading then burst out, &quot;They did it!&quot;

&quot;Did what?&quot; Touga Kiryuu demanded, his long red hair a
mess and the sword he carried dripping with boomer
blood.

With a rumble the outside of a nearby office tower
peeled back, revealing a older but still useable
weapons emplacement. Metal ground on metal as it
turned, energy building within it, them with a roar it
spat out a blast of energy right into one of the
masses of rioting boomers, destroying them and much of
the street in the process.

&quot;Holy...&quot; a younger AD police officer breathed out as
more explosions began to ring out across the city,
lighting up the smokey air.

&quot;The old city defense systems from back when NERV was
based here,&quot; Sylia said, her eye flashing, &quot;Mackie and
the others must have reactivated them!&quot;

Cutting down any boomers that reached their lines the
survivors watched in awe as the heavy weapons of
nearly forty years ago did their deadly work, gutting
the heart out of the massive boomer onslaught. From
millions of boomers their numbers dropped more and
more, until finally only thousands remained.

&quot;I think the guns have hit their limit,&quot; Utena said as
the weapons across the city began to shut down, the
pink haired woman standing ready with sword in hand.

&quot;They&#39;ve cut the odds from impossible to merely
extremely difficult,&quot; Sylia noted as she pulled her
helm back on and readied for battle once more.

&quot;All right everyone,&quot; Sailor Moon met her friends and
comrades eyes, &quot;let&#39;s take back our city.&quot;

&quot;YEAH!&quot; the crowd of police, mercenaries and heroes
cried, following their three leaders back into the
fray once more.

&quot;Nene,&quot; Priss paused to ask, &quot;what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Nene hefted her rifle, firing into a boomer and
turning it into so much pulp. &quot;We still haven&#39;t heard
from Mackie,&quot; she said flatly.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

A few minutes before, Lisa Valente knelt at Mackie
Stingray&#39;s side, studying the young man in concern as
he clutched at the control panel, his every muscle
taught and veins bulging. &quot;You&#39;ve got to pull out,&quot;
she said, eyes narrowed in fear.

&quot;What is he...?&quot; Minagi murmured, the light blue women
studying the man who had bodily plugged himself into
the computer system.

&quot;He&#39;s plugged himself into the system to replace the
computer core,&quot; Sailor Venus said, the blonde soldier
focused more on her captives than the struggling man.

&quot;Ngh... weapons A-5 activate... capture system G-12,
deploy,&quot; Mackie muttered feverishly, &quot;no Sylia, not
there...&quot;

The Bioware officer who&#39;s name tag read smith spoke
softly to his fellow captive, &quot;We&#39;ve got to make a
break for it.&quot;

&quot;Are you insane?&quot; his fellow captive hissed, his own
name tag reading Jones.

&quot;They&#39;re as distracted as they&#39;re going to get,&quot; Smith
answered, &quot;and I don&#39;t want to be around if they do
stop the boomers. You know we&#39;ll have to take the
fall.&quot;

Jones&#39; shoulders slumped a bit as the dark haired man
conceded, &quot;I know.&quot; He warily studied their captors,
noting a very distressing cry from the boy had
distracted them, &quot;On three?&quot;

&quot;One... two,&quot; Smith tensed, &quot;three!&quot;

Both men leapt up, Smith leaping for where his gun
rested on a counter nearby even as Jones raced for the
door. &quot;Leave it damn it,&quot; Jones paused to yell, a
grave mistake.

Minagi flickered out, disappearing, then reappeared on
top of him, swinging her energy blade in a deadly arc.
With a sizzling noise it cleaved through flesh and
bone then with a oddly peaceful sigh Jones collapsed
to the floor.

&quot;Look out,&quot; Sailor Venus yelled, trying to put herself
in the way of the pistol, cursing herself for not
destroying it earlier.

BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!

The first bullet splattered the Ayanami close, sending
it&#39;s head splashing against the wall it had been
mindlessly resting against. The second hit the
technician Reed, a bullet punching into his chest in a
splash of red. And the final bullet stabbed into
Mackie Stingray, sending the man convulsing on top of
the control panel.

&quot;No!&quot; Lisa screamed.

&quot;VENUS CRESCENT BEAM SMASH!&quot; Sailor Venus cried,
firing a energy bolt through Smith;&#39;s head and sending
his corpse crashing into the ground.

&quot;Mackie,&quot; Minagi teleported to the young man&#39;s side,
her eyes racing over him as she took in the damage.

&quot;Don&#39;t... unplug me,&quot; Mackie groaned, blood welling up
from between his lips, &quot;I have to finish this...&quot;

Lisa grabbed him by the arm, &quot;We have to, you&#39;ll bleed
to death!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s happening up there?&quot; Sailor Venus had to ask,
reaching out to stop Lisa.

&quot;I only... started the weapons,&quot; Mackie hissed
painfully, &quot;there&#39;s still.. Too many boomers there.
Need to cut their numbers... or we&#39;ll still be
overwhelmed.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot; Lisa started.

Minagi shook her head, &quot;Let him do what he has to.&quot;
Her voice firmed as she said, &quot;I&#39;ll do everything I
can to save him.&quot;

Long minutes dragged out as Mackie fought with the
computer system, laboriously bringing weapon systems
on line, destroying boomers by the thousands in the
city above them. Finally he seemed to relax, slumping
against the console even as he stopped breathing.

&quot;No,&quot; Sailor Venus made a choking sound as she pulled
him away from the computer to reveal the bloody chest
wound he had concealed from them as he worked. She
looked up at minagi as she yanked the connections
free, &quot;Minagi...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m gone,&quot; Minagi grabbed him then lifted off,
soaring out of the control room then ghosting through
the roof, her precious cargo in her arms.

&quot;Will he...?&quot; Lisa trailed off.

&quot;She&#39;ll take him to Washu,&quot; Sailor Venus said quietly
as they stood in the blood splattered control room,
&quot;if there&#39;s a way to save him, she&#39;ll find it.&quot;</pre>
