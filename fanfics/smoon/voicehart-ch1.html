<h1>Voices of the Heart</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/easimpson.html">EA Simpson</a><br> </h2>
<pre>They pretend it never happened, but really they all know that it did. A 
simple parting of ways that forces them to move from forward to back 
once again and they have no idea what they&#39;re doing once more.

Perhaps it is better this way, for the memories of the past have only 
served to hurt everyone far more deeply than they&#39;d ever thought 
possible.

And the memories of that night are better left untouched.

It&#39;s too painful.

Still, the planes come in and out of the airport every day like 
clockwork, and just this once, fate has decided to intervene.

Aino Minako catches sight of the tall, stunning woman standing near the 
baggage claim conveyer belt as soon as she disembarks from the plane. 
She&#39;s back in Tokyo for a few days now, in from a show in Kobe, and she 
was hoping that she could finally get in touch with the rest of her 
friends for a well-deserved and long-needed get-together. Still, she 
does not expect to see her of all people tapping her foot impatiently as 
she waits for the baggage from her flight to come in.

Minako hides a smile and makes her way towards the baggage claim, 
telling herself that she needs to go there anyway, to collect her own 
bags. This is so typical of their relationship, a non-descript and 
entirely random meeting that will only serve to amuse one and aggravate 
the other.

They&#39;re standing next to each other, carefully not looking at each 
other. A subtle tensing of the tall woman&#39;s shoulders tells Minako that 
Mars has sensed her presence. Perhaps it is not so much that they are 
not looking at each other, but rather that they are, with careful 
scrutiny born from years of practice. Mars will not make the first move; 
Minako has to do that, for Hino Rei is far too stubborn, too proud, to 
bend to the pressure of social graces.

&quot;Where are you coming from, Mars Reiko-san?&quot; Minako asks quietly, her 
voice low, intimate. It was her manager&#39;s grand scheme for her to travel 
like this, in business class and alone, for she was safer when she was 
on her own. When she was alone, she could blend with the aid of 
sunglasses and a few changes in the way that she arranged her hair. Now 
it was done up in a sloppy bun that drew attention away from her face 
and to her hair. No one would look twice at this girl with the frumpy 
hair and old sundress.

Rei exhales quietly, as if to calm her nerves. &quot;I wish you would stop 
calling me that,&quot; She turns to face Minako then, an annoyed look - a 
grimace really - crossing her face. It doesn&#39;t suit her, Minako thinks, 
for she&#39;s far too beautiful for her face to look so angry. &quot;It&#39;s not my 
name.&quot;

Minako smiles, for they&#39;re beginning their game as though it had never 
ended. She likes it when that happens, for it&#39;s easier to forget that 
they&#39;ve fallen apart and out of touch over the years. &quot;Reiko-san, you 
know that I will always call you by that name.&quot; Her baggage, a small 
black suitcase comes around the circle and she steps forward to pull it 
off the circular conveyer belt. She sets it down on the ground and 
adjusts the strap so that she can pull it behind her. &quot;It suits you, 
Mars.&quot;

Rei shakes her head, her shaggy hair cut falling into her eyes as she 
tries to hide an annoyed smile. Her hair is longer now, falling down her 
back and playing around her neck as though it&#39;s caught in the wind. 
Minako rather likes it like that, and she has to resist the urge to lean 
forward and brush Rei&#39;s bangs out of her eyes. There was a time and 
place for that, and it was not now. &quot;You always insist on your way, 
don&#39;t you, Venus?&quot;

Minako&#39;s grin widens, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t be me if I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Rei&#39;s hand shoots out and her fingers close around a small duffle bag&#39;s 
shoulder strap. She slings it over her shoulder and they fall into pace 
beside each other, without even thinking about it.

&quot;So you&#39;re back?&quot; Rei asks after a few minutes of silent, easy 
companionship, &quot;For good this time?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Minako says, shrugging. &quot;It all depends on this new 
record and the accompanying tour.&quot; Her gaze and smile turn devilish as 
she turns to stare at Rei, &quot;Did you miss me, Reiko-san?&quot;

Rei huffs and looks away. &quot;Don&#39;t ask such foolish things.&quot;

Minako looks at Rei and wonders where her Reiko is under all that 
awkward girl - beautiful woman - who doesn&#39;t remember the past life. It 
would do Rei well to remember the past, Minako thinks, for Rei is always 
confused by Minako&#39;s actions towards her. The memories from then would 
help to make the actions seem worthwhile and not completely random to 
Rei.

They continue on in silence, reliving the happy and the painful moments 
of their shared interaction. Rei&#39;s heels click on the airport&#39;s floor 
and Minako&#39;s sandals tap against the soles of her feet in time.

This is their own music.

They pass through another security check point and Minako finds herself 
thinking back to the events of the long-forgotten past. Not the past 
life, but just the past. The memories of the nights where she&#39;d insisted 
on spending far more time with Rei that was perhaps socially acceptable 
were some of her most treasured, and Minako knew that she would never 
feel for someone the way that she felt for Rei on those nights.

Especially when their one moment of weakness had shoved them head first 
into almost three years of limited (at best) communication.

Minako&#39;s lips still burn with the memory of that night. She raises a 
hand to touch them, wondering why Rei&#39;s foolish, drunken wonderful kiss 
still manages to evoke such feelings within her.

&quot;Where are you staying?&quot; Rei asks suddenly as she glares at the security 
officer who&#39;s currently taking far too much time passing her carry-on 
though the x-ray scanner. He scowls back at her and sends it through, 
Rei collecting her cell phone and keys from the little plastic tray and 
her bag from the conveyer belt.

Minako thinks that she looks the part of the harassed, and yet stunning 
CEO; her suit is clinging to her in such a way that the strap of her 
duffle bag over one shoulder just seems to draw attention to the very 
feminine figure hiding under the black linen suit jacket. Minako taps 
her chin thoughtfully as they continue on their way, it was never really 
a question that they would be leaving together, and sharing a taxi, most 
like. Spending the night together, however, seems a little forward, even 
for Mars Reiko. &quot;I&#39;m sure my manager booked me a hotel,&quot; she responds at 
length, her tone and face as even as she can make them. She cannot let 
it slip that she wants to spend the night somewhere other than the 
pristine and sterile beds that she usually sleeps in.

She doesn&#39;t want the unfamiliarity and the cold shoulder right now.

&quot;Cancel it.&quot;

&quot;Mars?&quot; Minako responds more out of habit that actual implication. 
Whenever Rei does something like this, the lines between herself and the 
girl that Minako remembers from the past life seem to blur to the point 
of where it&#39;s impossible to tell who is speaking to her. Minako cannot 
trust herself to say anything else, for any other name would fall out of 
her lips the way that a lover says a name. It&#39;s not a risk she wants to 
take, just yet.

Rei pauses, annoyance flickering across her face before the stony mask 
of no emotion at all falls back into place. &quot;You don&#39;t need a hotel in 
town, you have friends here.&quot; She looked uncertain for a moment, before 
adding, as if for emphasis, &quot;I&#39;m here.&quot;

Minako doesn&#39;t say anything for a moment, and watches as Rei flips her 
hair over her shoulder and stares at her expectantly. It was as if her 
Reiko was back once more, expecting her to rise to the challenge.

Still she hesitates, for the first time in a long while feeling very 
uncertain. She could go along with Rei&#39;s plan and simply crash on Rei&#39;s 
couch. She&#39;s done it in the past, staying with Ami or Makoto; and no one 
seemed to mind that much, but this is Mars who&#39;s asking her. The added 
complications are almost too much for her. She can&#39;t stand the idea that 
she might be caught off guard, that she might have to hold herself back 
and prevent herself from making a fool of them both.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Rei,&quot; she says, not meeting Rei&#39;s expectant gaze, &quot;Given 
our past record, this could be a very bad idea.&quot;

Rei glares at her, and reaches out to take Minako&#39;s hand in her own. 
They&#39;re almost out of the airport now, and no one thinks to look twice 
at the two women as they carry on their conversation. Minako is grateful 
that no one has noticed her so far, for her powers of disguise are not 
that great. She usually encountered a few more observant fans on these 
trips through the airport, but this journey had been thankfully silent.

Perhaps it is because Rei seems to ooze an aura of distant, 
unapproachable beauty. The aura that says that if you come near her, or 
her companions, that she will hurt you.

&quot;You&#39;re coming with me,&quot; Rei grunts, her palm sweaty against Minako&#39;s. 
Minako wonders how nervous she is, for Rei never, ever, gets flustered 
about anything.

She sighs and shrugs, interlacing her fingers with Rei&#39;s. &quot;Alright then, 
Rei, let&#39;s go.&quot; She&#39;s gong to have to call her manager later, but she&#39;s 
sure he&#39;ll understand. He usually does when it comes to her friendship 
with Hino Rei.

Rei&#39;s smile is entrancing, and Minako finds herself unable to look away. 
There is something dancing just behind her eyes that puts Minako on 
edge, something that she almost doesn&#39;t dare to hope for, the tell-tale 
glint of stormy emotions that Minako herself is plagued with. If Rei is 
feeling them too, then perhaps they can finally get to the end of these 
long, drawn out conversations, and finally talk about something 
important. There is something in that storm of emotions that makes 
Minako think that Rei wants to say something more and she waits 
expectantly for the words to finally work their way out of Rei&#39;s thick 
skull.

&quot;I don&#39;t know Mina,&quot; Rei says with a drawl and a drawn out wicked smile, 
&quot;it could be fun.&quot;

Minako starts, almost losing her grip on her suitcase, wondering when 
Rei started calling her by that very private nickname. It wasn&#39;t 
something that Rei had ever remembered - or done - in the past, and 
during the battles, Minako had been hard-pressed to get Rei to call her 
anything other than &#39;Venus&#39;.

How far we&#39;ve come... Minako thinks to herself, pushing back the private 
memories of the past that only she remembered. Artemis had told her that 
the chances of Rei and the others ever fully recovering their memories 
of the past life were slip, and Minako had long since given up hope of 
ever having someone to talk to about what had happened then. There was 
still so much left unresolved, and Minako hates being forced to pretend 
that everything was alright. &quot;Like old times, ne?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps,&quot; Rei&#39;s smile is mysterious and her tone hints that she knows 
more than she&#39;s letting on. Minako wonders what she&#39;s thinking briefly 
as they fall back into step again. She&#39;s so out of touch with everyone 
now that she wouldn&#39;t be surprised if there was something more that Rei 
was trying to say.

They leave the airport and Rei hails a cab with the ease of one who has 
done it more times than she can count. Minako just stands passively by 
as Rei takes her baggage from her and shoves it into the cab&#39;s trunk. 
She throws her own bag on top of Minako&#39;s suitcase and helps Minako into 
the car almost without seeming to think about it. Minako is not used to 
this image of Rei; the quiet, gallant type doesn&#39;t really suit her.

Perhaps it did once, long ago, when Minako was in desperate need of 
saving. Rei had been her knight in shining, fiery armor then too, 
telling her to live for herself and not for Venus, just this once. To 
get the surgery that would kill her on the off chance that she might 
actually be saved.

Minako missed that Rei.

She didn&#39;t know this new Rei very well, just little fragments of 
interaction here and there at events and reunions. They never really 
talked other than that, it was just too painful for them both to 
remember everything that had happened to them. Yes, Minako told herself 
quietly, that is it.

Rei clambered in behind her and slammed the door shut before the cab&#39;s 
automatic door could close it. She ignores the driver&#39;s odd looks in 
their direction and barks out an address and the route to it.

&quot;We&#39;re not going to the jinja?&quot; Minako asks with a note of confusion 
creeping into her voice. She doesn&#39;t remember a time when Rei didn&#39;t 
live in that place, so far removed from the city around her. She&#39;d been 
a young shrine maiden back then, when they&#39;d first met, and Minako had 
always assumed that she would continue on that path.

What did Rei do for a living now, anyways? Minako thinks that Usagi, in 
one of her many letters, might have mentioned that Rei was working for 
the government like her father, but that didn&#39;t seem right. From what 
Minako had seen of that relationship, there was no way that Rei would 
follow in his footsteps without a fight.

Rei shakes her head, &quot;I don&#39;t live there anymore. I moved out when I 
finished college.&quot; She has a strange look on her face, and Minako cannot 
read it.

&quot;Oh.&quot; She says, looking foolishly at her hands. They&#39;re clenched in her 
lap around the loose straps of her purse. &quot;I didn&#39;t know.&quot; She&#39;s been 
out of touch for too long and the fact of that matter is suddenly very 
apparent to her. How can she not know something like that about Rei, 
perhaps her closest friend?

They fall silent again, the city flying by outside the window as the cab 
driver&#39;s quiet sports broadcast chatters harmlessly in the background.

Minako chews her lip, wondering how to break the ice, to say that she&#39;s 
sorry for being insensitive. She doesn&#39;t know how to tell Rei that she&#39;s 
sorry for neglecting their friendship, but she has to say something. The 
silence is making her nervous.

&quot;What are you thinking?&quot; Rei asks quietly, her gaze intently focused on 
the window. Minako wonders if she&#39;s mad, or if Rei is just trying to 
break the ice and start conversation in the only way they seem to be 
able to. Direct, curt demands, followed by a concise answer; it&#39;s no way 
to talk to people. Minako knows that she&#39;d trained Rei to do it since 
their first meeting, but she never thought that Rei would continue to 
adhere to the strange pseudo-friendship that they&#39;d formed all those 
years ago.

Minako looks away from Rei before she answers; she doesn&#39;t that it would 
do her well to stare. &quot;That I was just rather rude.&quot;

Rei turns to look at her, confusion crossing her face in one of those 
adorable faces that Minako always finds herself teasing Rei for making. 
Her face is so expressive, she can&#39;t hide her emotions nearly as well as 
she thinks she can, and Minako loves to point that flaw in Rei&#39;s 
otherwise impenetrable defense to her as often as she can. &quot;Oh.&quot; She 
shrugs, &quot;I hadn&#39;t noticed.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re too hard-headed, Mars Reiko-san.&quot; Minako grins. Her face turns 
serious as she meets Rei&#39;s gaze as evenly as she can. She thinks that 
she might be blushing, but her cheeks don&#39;t feel nearly hot enough for 
it to be noticeable under her tan and make-up. &quot;I&#39;ve been out of touch 
with you all for too long.&quot;

She is the leader of the Sailor Senshi, and she knows that one day they 
will be called to arms once more. Still, Minako maintains the fact that 
she wants to live her life to the absolute fullest that she can. She 
does not think that Rei, nor Usagi if she really thought about it, would 
ever forgive her for not making the absolute best of the second chance 
at life she&#39;d been given.

Still, living has taken its toll on Minako&#39;s personal life. Her letters 
to and from Usagi are few and far between, and she can count on one hand 
the number of times that she&#39;s actually been able to spend time with her 
friends in longer periods than just a quick get-together for dinner 
someplace fancy. Usagi&#39;s wedding, Makoto&#39;s wedding, Ami&#39;s medical school 
graduation, that time they all went to the beach, Christmas last year...

The list seems to fall flat, judging by the fact that all of those 
events have happened over the course of the almost ten years that have 
passed since the final battle. They&#39;re all adults now, and Minako 
wonders if perhaps they simply do not have time for the friendships 
formed in childhood any longer.

Rei doesn&#39;t say anything in response to Minako&#39;s statement about being 
out of touch, and Minako wonders if it&#39;s Rei&#39;s way of punishing her for 
not being more active in preserving their friendship. She doesn&#39;t have 
long to ponder this most recent thought, however, for the taxi pulls up 
in front of a non-descript apartment complex. Rei pays the driver and 
holds the door open for Minako before going and collecting their luggage 
from the trunk. As the cab speeds away, Minako finds herself looking 
around.

This is not the sort of place that she would expect to find Hino Rei. It 
is tall - easily twenty or thirty stories - and industrial, with very 
little traditional d&#130;cor that she&#39;d always assumed that Rei was partial 
to. A few potted shrubs were placed at the entrance to the building, and 
a rather harassed-looking doorman was waiting for them to come to the 
door.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rei says, pulling her duffle bag over her shoulder. She 
doesn&#39;t take Minako&#39;s hand again, and Minako finds herself wishing that 
she would. It would be nice, she thinks, to hold hands like they had in 
the airport. Instead, the former fire senshi grabs Minako&#39;s suitcase and 
adjusts the handle so that she can pull it behind her with ease.

Minako finds her mouth opening, trying to say something, anything, to 
prevent Rei from acting like her personal servant. The words will not 
come, and she stands there for a minute with her mouth open, trying to 
find the right words. Rei does wait for her to pull herself together, 
however, and strides towards the door.

The doorman smiles at Rei and Minako finds herself hurrying to catch up 
with her friend.

&quot;How was China?&quot; the man asks.

&quot;Fine,&quot; Rei says curtly, walking through the door, Minako close on her 
heels.

&quot;China, Rei?&quot; Minako asks as they stop in front of the metal doors of 
the elevator. She&#39;s finally found her voice again and she&#39;s glad for 
that, for being speechless has never suited her needs. &quot;What were you 
doing there?&quot; She&#39;s curious as to what Rei could have been up to in a 
place like China, but she can&#39;t come out and say that, for her curiosity 
makes Rei clam up in that adorable way that Minako finds so endearingly 
frustrating.

The elevator dings and Rei steps inside, turning to face Minako with a 
scowl. &quot;Working,&quot; she says.

Minako thinks that that was obvious, but Rei doesn&#39;t want to elaborate, 
and so she steps into the elevator as well. The doors close and suddenly 
they are very much alone.

They&#39;re standing side by side, their shoulders just barely touching. 
This is the level of closeness that Minako is most used to when it comes 
to Rei, for they&#39;re always together, just a step away from being 
intimate. In this proximity, Minako can see a gentle flush across Rei&#39;s 
cheeks and she wonders what is bothering her friend. Rei&#39;s breath is 
coming in shallow gasps, barely enough to fill her lungs, as though 
she&#39;s trying desperately to calm herself down.

&quot;Rei?&quot; Minako asks, bringing a hesitant hand up to touch the other 
woman&#39;s shoulder. It is with that touch, the simply hand on a shoulder, 
that they&#39;ve crossed the line from close companionship to intimacy. 
Minako likes it, for being this close to Rei is soothing to her tired 
mind, and Rei never really seems to mind when they cross the line in 
private.

Still, this is closer than Minako has been to, well, anyone, in a long 
time. She can&#39;t think straight and the quiet thump of Rei&#39;s duffle bag 
falling to the floor is completely lost on her as she stands there, lost 
in this feeling of being close to someone once more.

Almost as suddenly as Minako spaced out, she finds herself brought back 
to reality with a jolt that she was not expecting. Rei has her pressed 
up against the cool steel of the elevator wall, her lips burning a fiery 
trail along Minako&#39;s neck. Minako shivers under the attention, as sudden 
and unexpected as it is. She hadn&#39;t thought Hino Rei capable of doing 
something so delightfully impulsive, and she&#39;s happy that Rei finally is 
acting on the unspoken sexual tension between the two of them.

&quot;Rei...ko,&quot; Minako gasps. She can&#39;t think straight. She&#39;s wanted this 
for so long and now it is finally happening and she can&#39;t even work her 
hands enough to pull Rei&#39;s mouth away from her neck so that they can 
kiss properly. She feels Rei&#39;s hands dance lower on her back and she 
grinds out; &quot;What?&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes are hazy as she meets Minako&#39;s gaze, and her voice is 
distant. She leans forward, closer than Minako has ever been with 
another human in this life, and whispers into Minako&#39;s ear. &quot;You are 
always talking about the past life, Mina, but you haven&#39;t asked if our 
memories of the past live had returned since Usagi came back.&quot;

Minako has no words, her mind has flown into overdrive and she can&#39;t 
slow it down. The words, she thinks, are lost somewhere between Rei&#39;s 
hot breath in her ear and the hands that are now toying with the hem of 
her sundress. She tries to find a way to force the words to come out, 
but they stubbornly refuse to come. Venus Minako, it seems, is finally 
at a loss for words.

Aino Minako, however, will not back down from a challenge like this. She 
rests her hands on Rei&#39;s shoulders and pushes her away gently. Rei is 
not herself, Minako knows this, and she knows that Rei will hate herself 
when she realizes what she&#39;s done. Minako has to stop this before 
something happens that they both will regret.

Her tone is even when she speaks, and Minako can feel the desire cooling 
under Rei&#39;s smoldering gaze. &quot;I thought that you&#39;d say something, Rei. 
You were always running to me with your questions about the past life, I 
assumed that you&#39;d tell me when your memories returned.

The elevator tings. They&#39;ve arrived on Rei&#39;s floor.

Rei backs away from Minako and picks up her duffle bag from the floor 
and grabs Minako&#39;s suitcase. She looks as though she wants to say 
something, but the haze is gone from her eyes and Minako can see that 
Rei is suddenly back to being herself.

Together they head down the hallway and Rei fumbles for her keys. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry,&quot; she says quietly as she slides the key into the lock. &quot;I... 
don&#39;t know what came over me.&quot;

Minako can see that she&#39;s mortified by her actions, and the singer has 
no idea how to console Rei. She&#39;s never done something like this; she 
has no experience to draw on. She doesn&#39;t know to say that she liked the 
attention and would love it if Rei continued it at some point in the 
near future. She stays silent because she has no words, no idea what she 
can say to Rei to make the situation better.

Rei pushes the door open, and allows Minako to go in before she closes 
the door and slides the chain into place. Minako wonders if this is done 
on purpose, of it Rei just does it out of habit.

They&#39;re walking on eggshells now and Minako can not think of a good way 
to break the silence between them. She takes off her hat and sunglasses 
and follows Rei&#39;s example in removing her shoes. Suddenly, they&#39;re the 
same height again. Rei is out of her fuck-me pumps and has lost the 
three-inch edge that she had over Minako&#39;s flat bottomed sandals. Minako 
rather likes the heels, but she steadfastly refuses to say anything to 
Rei about how much they accent her leg line and how beautiful she looks 
in her business attire.

She sits down next to Rei on the sofa and rather pointedly, again, does 
not look at her. Not looking, Minako realizes, is her way of looking 
quite intently at Rei. It is when she does not look that she can finally 
see what&#39;s really going on in Rei&#39;s head. She likes it better that way, 
for the not looking helps her to focus her thoughts without becoming 
distracted, as she always inevitably does, by the stunning beauty of 
Hino Rei.

Minako remembers meeting the girl for the first time, in a church of all 
places, and how Rei&#39;s beauty had struck her then as absolutely stunning. 
Learning that she was Mars, and that she&#39;d loved Mars Reiko in a past 
life had almost taken a second seat to that meeting the church, when 
Minako realized just how attracted she was to this girl.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Minako starts, her gaze intently fixed on the corner of the room. 
She&#39;s looking at a low chest of drawers with a few trinkets and 
photographs that Minako recognizes from her few past forays into Rei&#39;s 
bedroom at the Jinja all those years ago.

&quot;Don&#39;t-&quot; Rei mutters. Out of the corner of her eye, Minako can see that 
Rei&#39;s head is turned in the direction opposite her own gaze.

Minako sighed and turned to face Rei, pulling up her legs and sitting 
cross-legged on the couch. She adjusts her skirt for a moment, and the 
reaches out to pull on Rei&#39;s shoulder.

Rei stiffens under her touch and Minako can barely keep the hurt from 
her voice as she forces herself to chose her words as carefully as she 
can. She doesn&#39;t want to scare Rei off, but she wants Rei to tell her 
what the heck just happened. She goes for direct, for Rei always has 
responded well to curt, military-like address. Minako guesses that it&#39;s 
a carry-over from either her father in this life or the past one; she 
can&#39;t decide. &quot;I&#39;m serious, Rei. What was that?&quot;

&quot;I... don&#39;t know. Her - Mars Reiko&#39;s - memories are so powerful that I 
sometimes lose control.&quot; Rei won&#39;t look at Minako. &quot;I&#39;m sorry...&quot;

Minako touches Rei&#39;s cheek, &quot;I know, Rei, believe me, I know.&quot; She does 
know, for when she first realized who Hino Rei was, she could hardly 
control herself in her want for Rei to remember the past as well. She 
tried everything she could think of, but nothing would make Mars&#39; 
memories return.

She remembers feeling powerless to fight against destiny, and her 
decision to simply give up once and for all. She&#39;d been ready to die for 
their cause, but the memories of Mars Reiko only seemed to make the 
situation feel so much worse. Suddenly she couldn&#39;t even interact with 
her chosen comrade without being plagued with memories of that girl that 
she should not have had.

The memories were a curse, a burden that Minako would not have wished on 
anyone. She begged Rei and the others to remember, but she could feel 
that her heart was not really in her words. She knew that she would not 
wish horrors of the past life on anyone, for the memories, it seemed 
where hers alone to bear.

Still, the idea that Rei has remembered the past life is an intriguing 
concept. Finally, Minako will have someone to talk to about what 
happened back then. There are so many things that she has stored in the 
back of her mind that she does not really understand. There are some 
incidents where the past life that make about as much sense as some of 
the more idiotic things that Usagi says when she gets excited about 
something.

The silence is growing unbearable, but Minako will not pull her hand 
away from Rei&#39;s cheek. She can&#39;t, for there is a force holding it there 
that Minako had quite forgotten about in the long months that have 
passed since she last saw Rei. There is an almost electric sort of 
magnetism between the two of them, and Minako will not deny her 
instincts when it comes to chancing physical contact with the one she 
loves.

They&#39;re staring into each other&#39;s eyes, and Minako can see the 
uncertainty and worry in Rei&#39;s gaze. There are no words that Minako can 
say to Rei to make the uneasiness go away - for Minako knows that the 
same uncertainty is clearly written across her own face. Minako has 
gotten good had hiding her emotions over the years, but she knows that 
she&#39;s somewhat of an open book when it comes to Rei. Especially now, 
when emotions are running high and Rei has already surprised her once 
today.

Rei sighs, &quot;How do you combat that?&quot; She leans into Minako&#39;s hand, a 
slight blush on her cheeks.

Minako pulls her hand away slowly. She&#39;s not sure who she&#39;s talking to 
again, and she doesn&#39;t want to risk doing anything to potentially 
alienate Rei further.

&quot;You get used to it. That&#39;s all I can really tell you. The memories fade 
in intensity until they sort of just meld together with your own 
memories from this life.&quot; Minako chews on her lip and tries to think of 
something more that she can say. Nothing comes to mind, and she knows 
that this is probably because her own memories still flare up at random 
times. She doesn&#39;t know what comes after acceptance.

Silence. The minutes tick away and Minako finds herself squirming again. 
She wonders why Rei won&#39;t say anything, but she knows that the silence 
is just another part of their relationship. They don&#39;t have anything to 
say to each other, so they don&#39;t talk. It&#39;s the rule of their friendship 
that they&#39;ve both been adhering to since the past life, thousands of 
years ago.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go change.&quot; Rei announces, standing up suddenly and 
leaving Minako alone on the couch.

Minako smiles brightly at Rei, and she doubts that the other woman knows 
the window for teasing that she&#39;s just created. The contented smirk 
crosses Minako&#39;s face like it is second nature, and Minako leans back on 
the couch, stretching her legs out in front of her and wiggling her 
toes. &quot;Must you?&quot; she asks.

The confusion in Rei&#39;s eyes is completely worth the lecture she&#39;s about 
it get, and Minako feels her smirk slowly turning into a full on smile. 
&quot;Eh?&quot;

She is a shark, Minako realizes, slowly circling her prey. Toying with 
it, almost, if one were to carry the metaphor that far. &quot;I like you in 
that, Rei-chan.&quot; She draws out the honorific, as they usually don&#39;t 
bother with them except for when Minako is teasing with false flattery 
and politeness that has never existed in their relationship. She taps 
her chin appraisingly and looks Rei up and down, making sure her eyes 
linger in all the right places to make Rei blush. &quot;It&#39;s quite sexy.&quot;

Rei flushes bright red. She splutters out nonsense for a few seconds 
while Minako laughs quietly. &quot;Idiot! What are you saying?&quot;

Minako shrugs. &quot;Nothing really.&quot; She&#39;s winding Rei in circles, and she&#39;s 
starting to realize that she loves doing this far more than anything 
else in the world. This was better than being an international pop star, 
better than being a sailor senshi, better than anything that Minako 
remembers from the past life. It was just a pure act of love, and she 
was pretty sure that Rei knew it to be the same thing. They play this 
game with each other because it is the only way, really, that their 
personalities can mesh without them wanting to kill each other.

She rests her chin thoughtfully on her hand, tapping her fingers against 
her cheek and grins widely at Rei. She is moving in for the kill now, 
and the panicked expression in Rei&#39;s eyes told her that the former fire 
senshi is very much aware of the fact. &quot;Just that I like looking at you, 
Reiko-chan. Business attire can be quite sexy.&quot; She raises her eyebrows 
suggestively.

Rei&#39;s eyes are like fire, burning a path into Minako&#39;s own, piercing 
holes in Minako&#39;s steady resolve as she struggles to react to Minako&#39;s 
statement. Minako can see her searching for words, tossing possibilities 
around in her head as she struggles for the perfect way of telling 
Minako exactly what she thinks of her.

&quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; Rei snaps. It&#39;s almost like a knee-jerk reaction, 
a carry-over from the old days when they were still unsure of what 
exactly it was that they felt for each other. Rei&#39;s hands clench and 
unclench, and she steadies herself to start to unbutton her suit&#39;s 
jacket. She shrugs off the garment and tosses it over the arm of the 
sofa. &quot;I&#39;m not her.&quot;

Rei looks so vulnerable, standing in stocking feet and an angry 
expression in the middle of her own living room. Minako wants to reach 
out, to touch her and tell her that everything is going to be alright, 
for that&#39;s all that she can do, really. She cannot fix Rei&#39;s almost 
irrational fear of the past life, and she will not allow it to rule 
their relationship in the present day.

She is not the girl that she once was, so obsessed with the past because 
she had no future. She is Aino Minako, and she could be there for a 
friend who is having trouble accepting the fact that her memories are no 
longer wholly her own.

Minako stands up and walks to stand by Rei. They&#39;re facing opposite 
directions, as they&#39;ve done so often in the past, for facing the same 
way would hurt them so much more than this. They&#39;re diametrically 
opposed; they need to be apart in order to be together. She can&#39;t bring 
herself to touch Rei, she&#39;s almost afraid of what might happen if she 
does. &quot;It&#39;s a nickname, Rei,&quot; she says simply. Minako turns to look at 
Rei and smiles as she can see realization dawning in Rei&#39;s eyes. &quot;A 
nickname that I&#39;ve given you in two lifetimes now, you should just 
accept that it&#39;s a part of you.&quot;

Rei crosses her arms over her blouse and frowns. &quot;I don&#39;t like it.&quot;

Minako laughs. &quot;I don&#39;t think you like anything.&quot;

Rei stares at her, open-mouthed. &quot;I like...&quot; she trails off and Minako 
gives her an expectant look, as if daring her to finish her sentence. 
&quot;Some things.&quot; She&#39;s giving Minako an appraising look, as if she&#39;s 
trying to show just how attracted to each other they both are.

Minako reaches out and touches Rei&#39;s shoulder then. &quot;You like stalking 
me,&quot; there&#39;s a smile in her voice now, and Minako hasn&#39;t felt this happy 
in a long time.

&quot;I do not,&quot; Rei retorts, leaning into Minako&#39;s touch on her shoulder. &quot;I 
just like knowing where you are.&quot;

Minako thinks that she can accept that reality. Their heads are almost 
touching now as Rei leans into her even farther. &quot;What are you doing, 
Rei?&quot; Minako asks, knowing that they&#39;re dangerously close to that 
forbidden territory once more.

Rei doesn&#39;t say anything for along moment. Their faces inches apart. 
Minako can feel Rei&#39;s breath on her face and she wants desperately to 
lean in and kiss those beautiful lips. She checks the reflex and waits 
for Rei to make the first move. She knows that in order for this to 
work, Rei has to make the move.

&quot;I ... want to kiss you, Mina,&quot; Rei breaths, her eyes shut tightly and 
her face screwed up as though she&#39;s expecting Minako to do something 
awful like slap her.

Minako sighs quietly and smiles as brightly as she can. Rei&#39;s still got 
her eyes shut, but Minako knows that Rei can feel her smile. Rei&#39;s 
always been good with that sort of thing, seeing people and being able 
to read their auras. Minako&#39;s talents - perhaps leftovers from the past 
life - lay in reading the emotions of others. &quot;Then do it.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes snapped open and Minako can see none of the haze that had 
clouded them earlier in the elevator. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; she asked, her 
tone hesitant and her body already starting to move backwards and away 
from the closeness that they&#39;d been enjoying.

Minako reaches down with her free hand and grab&#39;s Rei&#39;s own, leading her 
back to the couch. She&#39;s not going to let Rei kiss her again in a 
location where Rei can bolt if it doesn&#39;t go off exactly as planned. 
They sit down side by side once more, this time much closer to each 
other. &quot;You talk too much, aren&#39;t Martians supposed to be the stoic, 
silent type?&quot; Minako says, falling back into the teasing pattern once 
more.

&quot;Says the brooding Venusian,&quot; Rei shoots back without leaving time for 
their usual insult, beat, insult style of interaction.

Minako leans in and wraps her arms around Rei&#39;s neck. Their noses almost 
touch and she knows that this time that the make up and tan will do 
nothing to hide her blush. It mirrors Rei&#39;s own, bright red and 
beautiful. &quot;Shut up and kiss me,&quot; she says, kissing Rei&#39;s nose with an 
impish grin.

The position is awkward for kissing, but it&#39;s a lot like their 
relationship - all strange angles and odd looks. Minako allows Rei to 
take the lead once more, the former fire senshi slipping her arms around 
Minako&#39;s waist and pulling her in even closer as she finally allows 
their lips to meet.

The kiss is chaste, but everything that Minako remembers from that night 
all those years ago, the promise of things to come, and a good deal of 
something that Minako knows has a name. She will not call it that, 
however, for there is something oddly off about using that term to 
describe what she and Rei have.

Rei leans in once more and Minako allows herself to get lost in this 
newest form of competition between the two of them. What starts as a 
gentle probe of Rei&#39;s tongue against her bottom lip soon escalates into 
a kiss quite unlike anything that Minako has ever experienced in this 
lifetime.

She decides that she quite likes it.

Perhaps this time, they will finally achieve happiness.
