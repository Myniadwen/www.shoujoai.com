<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>Minako&#39;s POV

I want you so bad...

To feel the warmth of your body pressed to my own as we share a heated 
kiss, two lovers caught up in a silent passion...until we were forced to 
separate for air. Cursed air, yet we both need it as much as we needed 
each other. That&#39;s what I wanted to believe in. I want to believe in 
you, in us.

Your hands trailing up my sides, stroking my skin gently, blessing it 
with a tingling sensation that made me feel alive.

I want to share my life with you.

My heart sped up hearing you soft gasps and groans as I returned the 
favor, bringing a smile to my lips. If only this could be our forever. 
It could be, if you would accept it and me. I know I would if you gave 
me the chance. Because...

I love you.

Morning

With those fading words I stretched out beside me to feel the spot cool. 
Without opening my eyes I instantly realized that it had been another 
dream. I had been getting quite a few of those lately...only they&#39;ve 
been getting stronger. This one was the strongest so far. It felt so 
real and so right as it happened but now it left me feeling all the more 
disappointed, knowing it wasn&#39;t reality...

Unconsciously my fingers brushed the cool quilt on Rei&#39;s futon where Rei 
should have been.

&quot;Rei?&quot; My eyes shot open, searching for the raven-haired woman. 
&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; I called a bit louder. Where was she?

&quot;One, two, three.&quot;

Her voice drifted into the room. It was soft and faint, yet I could tell 
she was close by. Relief flooded into my heart hearing that voice. But I 
wanted to see her. I wanted...

More than I would ever get.

The feeling tore me up inside. This was me, my feelings for her that 
caused me such pain. Knowing love was supposed to be my ability, my 
gift. But why is it so hard? Why does it hurt so much?

Maybe...maybe I&#39;m feeling like this because we&#39;re so close. It wasn&#39;t 
those blissful small encounters that happened occasionally through the 
past few weeks. We were now spending long hours together, just the two 
of us.

Alone.

The counting suddenly stopped. &quot;Mina-chan? Are you awake?&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV

I thought I heard Mina&#39;s voice but it couldn&#39;t be, could it? She isn&#39;t 
usually up this early right?

&quot;Mina-chan? Are you awake?&quot;

I stepped down the hallway and into the room only to feel myself step 
immediately. Mina was awake. And damn it...Mina chan...

The sight was almost unbearable. Sunlight streamed through the window 
blinds onto her form, illuminating her, as the true goddess she was. 
Here was the goddess of love propping herself up on her elbows yet still 
partially covered by the sheets. The straps of her tank top were sliding 
off a bit on her narrow shoulders, threatening to fall off, revealing a 
little too much skin. It was almost as much as her legs were showing. 
With one leg out of the covers and her short shorts (love them but curse 
them!) I had quite a view. Yet her most alluring features were her eyes. 
Almost instantly mine were drawn to them, as a moth to a flame. I saw 
those cerulean blues were searching me but for what? Was there something 
I was missing? Why...did it look like she was about to cry?

&quot;Mina?&quot; I was startled to see tears forming in her eyes. Immediately I 
broke from my frozen state and was at her side. &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Do you 
feel sick?&quot; Worry gripped me with an iron fist.

She shook her head, sobbing every once so often. &quot;I&#39;m fine, really. 
Don&#39;t worry about me.&quot; She paused to wipe the tears. &quot;Were...you 
practicing again?&quot;

&quot;Of course. I&#39;m not going to do anything half way! If I agree to do it, 
then I do it with everything I&#39;ve got. I&#39;m not one to waste time even 
though we have quite a bit to go.&quot;

Erm...although, keeping my eyes off Mina chan is becoming very hard to 
resist. Ah! Bad thoughts! Bad thoughts! I mentally hit myself. If I 
could, I&#39;d groan and hide away under a rock and never come out. 
This...was embarrassing. I hope she doesn&#39;t notice my staring.

&quot;Rei-chan...Thank you so much!&quot; She then did the worst thing she could 
have done. Another hug...crap! I tried to scoot back but it was too 
late, we had been too close.

&quot;N-no need to thank me.&quot; I quickly pried her off. The thought of feeling 
that smooth, silky skin under my fingertips was bringing up unpleasant, 
no, uncomfortable emotions. &quot;When...did you change?&quot; I eyed her attire. 
When we went to sleep last night she hadn&#39;t been wearing long clothes 
had she?

&quot;This?&quot; She innocently pulled at her tank top straps, making my eyes go 
wide. &quot;Oh, well...it sort of...became a bit warm and I went to change.&quot;

Why does she have to look so cute?

I thought back to her words trying to concentrate on what she had just 
said. Became warm...like as I was right now? OH DAMMIT! This time I 
really did slap my head.

Slap!

Oww...

&quot;Rei-chan, why did you just slap yourself?&quot; She giggled. &quot;That&#39;s not 
very smart you know; hitting your head kills brain cells.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, it&#39;s just that I feel so stupid!&quot; (That was partially right.) I 
decided to ignore the brain cells comment. &quot;I should have kept a window 
open or something. I didn&#39;t mean to make you feel uncomfortable. Gomen 
ne.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s no problem at all!&quot; Mina beamed. &quot;Would you like me to help you 
practice some more?&quot;

Practice? Oh yea, that&#39;s right, there&#39;s only one day left till the 
concert.

&quot;Are there any more scheduled practices?&quot; I silently prayed there 
wouldn&#39;t be. I don&#39;t know how much longer I can hold off from killing 
Manuke. If he tells me &#39;I suck&#39; one more time I swear I&#39;ll strangle him. 
No, even worse, I&#39;ll have him perform it himself. Let&#39;s see him doing 
those consecutive twirls ten times in a row. Now that would be something 
to see!

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so. Manuke said that you were smart and you&#39;d 
probably get the hang of it on your own.&quot;

Meaning he just wants to see me mess it all up for Mina at the concert. 
Who said flattery got you anywhere? It really got my blood boiling.

&quot;What do you think?&quot; I asked curiously. Does she have any faith in me? 
&quot;I mean, I don&#39;t want to ruin your chances-&quot;

My words were silenced when Mina pressed her finger to my lips. &quot;Hmm, 
what do I think? I think... I&#39;ll believe in Rei-chan.&quot; Her eyes 
twinkled.

You believe in me...huh? I had to smile. When have I heard that last 
from anyone?

&quot;I think I almost have it down but a little more practice couldn&#39;t help. 
What do you plan on doing? Is there anywhere you need to be today or do 
you need to grab some stuff from your home?&quot;

&quot;Why, are you suggesting that I stay over for another night?&quot; Mina 
leaned in till our faces were inches apart, smiling that irresistible 
smile of hers. When I couldn&#39;t say anything she broke in a fit of 
giggles, taking advantage of my speechless state. Before I could retort 
with a snappy comment, she had laid her head down in my lap, immediately 
silencing my thoughts. &quot;I don&#39;t have anywhere I need to be...&quot; She idly 
arched her back as she stretched out. Don&#39;t stare, don&#39;t stare, don&#39;t 
stare. &quot;But you know, we could always go to my place and practice there. 
My mom is in England, so we&#39;d have the place all to ourselves. We could 
stay up and practice as much as we want without anyone to bother us. 
What do you think of that?&quot;

One look at those beautiful eyes trapped me. She knew the answer before 
I could say it. &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what you want.&quot;

There was an odd gleam in Mina&#39;s eyes as I said this, again making me 
inwardly squirm.

&quot;Umm, but can I meet you there? There&#39;s something I want to do first.&quot;

&quot;Oh, like what pray tell?&quot;

I need answers. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll get them but if I don&#39;t try, I know 
that I&#39;ll keep stumbling around blind in my own emotions.

&quot;I need to meditate a bit. Clear my thoughts so I can fully 
concentrate.&quot; I&#39;m doing this for you...

Mina nodded. &quot;I understand. Meet ya there then, just don&#39;t take too long 
&#39;kay?&quot;

&quot;Yes master.&quot; I rolled my eyes.

She slapped my arm, protesting, &quot;I&#39;m not that bad!&quot;

At this I stood up on my knees, allowing the woman to fall onto the 
futon in surprise. &quot;Then I can stop being your pillow.&quot; She should have 
seen that coming. &quot;Oh great leader.&quot; I quickly added.

The blonde glared back at me through her messed up hair, threatening to 
do something evil. Remembering last nights pillow fight, I knew I 
wouldn&#39;t stand a chance against that sort of evil again.

&quot;Rei-eep!&quot; I took the initiative before she could go on the offensive, 
taking her down before doing my worst. &quot;N-no! Rei-ahahaha, stop! Y-you 
know I&#39;m tickl-ahahahahahahahaha!&quot;

I tickled her a few minutes longer until she was unable to fight back, 
or stand for that matter. When I stopped to give her air, Mina limply 
laid on her back, her chest heaved as she breathed heavily.

&quot;Meanie...haha, ow...&quot;

In the moment I pressed our foreheads together, reminding her, 
&quot;Remember, all&#39;s fair in love and war. Catch you later.&quot;

Minako&#39;s POV, park

When I wanted her hands on me, I didn&#39;t mean as in tickling. Ow...now my 
sides hurt. She didn&#39;t hold back. Damn her. Oooh, I&#39;ll just have to get 
her back! But how? How can you surprise someone who&#39;s psychic?

I had been so absorbed in my thoughts that I hadn&#39;t noticed a figure 
walking towards me.

&quot;Ah, there you are my beautiful flower.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; I looked up to see that it was Manuke. He was dressed up in 
his usual black suit.

&quot;Is it a crime to tell a woman that she&#39;s beautiful?&quot; He asked, trying 
to look a little hurt.

&quot;Well, no, I suppose not.&quot;

I felt him try to slip his arm around me but I quickly step sideways and 
avoided it. &quot;Sorry Manuke, I have somewhere I need to be.&quot;

&quot;Oh, I see...can I come along then?&quot;

I don&#39;t think Rei-chan would like that very much. Manuke and her don&#39;t 
seem to get along at all do they? And since I&#39;m going to my home and Rei 
was going to meet me there later... &quot;Nope. I&#39;m really sorry but 
it&#39;s...personal.&quot; That would be the best way to put it.

In response he pouted and his shoulders slumped. &quot;So...umm, where&#39;s your 
&#39;friend&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Who? Rei-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yeah...&quot; He agreed through gritted teeth. &quot;Rei-chan.&quot; It looked like it 
was painful for him to smile.

&quot;She&#39;s busy practicing.&quot;

&quot;Ahhhhh...I wonder though, do you think she&#39;ll be ready for the 
performance? It is tomorrow.&quot; He reminded me.

&quot;Of course she will be.&quot;

&quot;Why is that? Hmm?&quot;

&quot;Because I believe in her. She&#39;ll come through, I know she will.&quot;

Because...my heart tells me so.

That was what I wanted to believe in. I want to believe in you, in us. 
The words from the dream came back to my mind.

&quot;Then shall we make a bet?&quot;

&quot;A bet?&quot; I repeated. &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;If Rei-chan can&#39;t come through for you, you&#39;ll go out on a date with 
me. But if she does come through, I&#39;ll guarantee your career for as long 
as you want.&quot;

My career...

&quot;...No thank you.&quot;

&quot;Huh? What&#39;s wrong, didn&#39;t you say you had faith in her?&quot;

&quot;I do have faith, but making such a bet wouldn&#39;t be fair to Rei-chan. It 
would be like using her. I...I would rather earn my way with her, that 
we&#39;d get through this together. So I thank you for your kind offer but I 
cannot accept. Good day.&quot;

Park, after Mina has left

&quot;I can&#39;t believe she just turned me down.&quot; Manuke&#39;s face twisted in 
disgust as he lit a smoke. &quot;Ah well, there&#39;s still Rei to talk to. 
Hehehe...&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV, Sacred Fire Room

I cleared my mind as I felt the fire beacon to me. I truly want to 
believe these feelings are mine, that I really love Mina-chan. So I&#39;ve 
come to ask the fire to show me a vision. It could be another locked 
away memory or perhaps, it would show me my true heart&#39;s desire.

I was going to take a chance.

Shroooosh

Vision


&quot;MARS!&quot;

A battlefield...? There were so many dead soldiers. Their corpses 
littered the ground, all of them were either mutilated with open wounds 
or their bodies had been turned into nothing but piles of ash.

&quot;AHHHHHHHHH!&quot; Someone was screaming.

Was it me?

I started to shiver as a chill down my spine. My body began to convulse, 
feeling something forcing its way in. Trapped. Trapped! The word echoed 
through my mind. Every muscle screamed out as I felt them burn, 
ligaments had begun to tear. Why couldn&#39;t I move? Please!

A Sailor Senshi soul...how delicious it would be.

Through a moment of strength one of my eyes opened momentarily. For a 
few seconds I could see Venus screaming my name, alarm apparent in her 
eyes. I wanted to tell her it was all right. I wish I could find my 
voice but it was still screaming. I...I can&#39;t stop screaming!

What&#39;s wrong? Does it hurt? Tell me that it does, I enjoy hearing you 
scream.

Get out of my body!

Still have some struggle in you? You ARE quite the prize. Those full 
grown men didn&#39;t even last two seconds...such a pity.

I said get out!

Or what?

&quot;VENUS, KILL ME!&quot; I screamed.

&quot;I can&#39;t! Mars... MARS!&quot;

Looks like your plan won&#39;t work, the girl loves you. Isn&#39;t that sweet? 
She&#39;ll be next, I can promise you that. I do hope she&#39;ll scream more 
than you.

&quot;ARRRRRRRRRGH!&quot;

W-What&#39;s going on here? What are you doing? The demon&#39;s voice grew 
worried. My body temperature was heating up exponentially to dangerously 
high levels. Flames began to surround me, fueled by my own power.

Trying to take me down with you? Foolish, I&#39;ll just- Wait, 
why...can&#39;t...I get out?

Gomen ne...Venus.

FLAAAASH

The scene had warped into a black void of nothing-ness. Before I could 
wonder what was going on, I spotted a figure across from me.

&quot;Mina chan?&quot;

I reached out and walked towards her only to see a large cloud shoot up 
in front of me, blocking my path. It had red eyes. Revenge was reflected 
in those hateful crimson slits.

To my dismay, Mina gave me a sad smile before the vision broke, like a 
glass mirror being shattered into a thousand pieces.

I could see her fall, eyes closed and all.

Sacred Fire Room

&quot;MINA!&quot; My eyes searched frantic around the room. &quot;S-she&#39;s...that&#39;s 
right, hah...hah...I-it was only a dream. A nightmare.&quot; I corrected 
myself.

But what the hell did it mean? I was sure the battle was another memory 
but then why did that monster appear in the second vision? It was the 
present wasn&#39;t it? Didn&#39;t Mars take that demon down with her...? Wait a 
minute, if that was true, did that mean...that I died?

&quot;I...I need to go practice. I need to go to Mina&#39;s place.&quot; If I had that 
one thought in mind, the one thought that I could concentrate on, then I 
think I can keep my sanity. Although we had only been apart for about an 
hour, it felt like an eternity.

It made me realize that I just want to see her. I want to see her smile 
happily, nothing like that sad smile before the second vision shattered. 
I want...her to be safe.

With that I picked myself up and stumbled out of the room, determined to 
make me way to where she would be waiting for me.

Park

As I ran forward, I noticed a figure waiting in my direct path. From 
first glance I knew immediately who it was. Just great...

&quot;Hello Rei-chan.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I&#39;ve got no time for you right now.&quot; I tried to run past him but 
he grabbed my arm and held me back. The sudden jerk on my limb had 
almost made me trip and fall backwards. &quot;What&#39;s your problem? Didn&#39;t you 
hear me?&quot; I growled angrily back.

&quot;Oh, I heard you.&quot; He released me hand. &quot;But I thought I should tell you 
something. It&#39;s about Mina chan.&quot;

That had caught my attention. &quot;What about Mina?&quot; I demanded.

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t you like to know?&quot; He sneered. &quot;Why of course you would.&quot; I 
watched him laugh as though my concern was the funniest thing in the 
world. Bastard. &quot;There&#39;s a bet right now Rei-chan and you&#39;re it. If you 
screw up, you know Mina&#39;s career is gonna go down the drain like snap.&quot; 
Snap. Manuke snapped his fingers for emphasis. &quot;I just wanted to let you 
know, if you mess up, I can still save her career...and...she&#39;ll be all 
mine. If you lose, she&#39;ll have to date me. What do you say to that?&quot;

I frowned. &quot;I&#39;d say you better not get your hopes up, because I WILL 
come through for her.&quot;

&quot;Oooh, so confident are we? Well, remember, the bigger they are, the 
harder they fall. And when you&#39;ll fall, you&#39;ll fall hard. I can promise 
you that my dear. Y ou&#39;ll lose E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G.&quot;

Knowing I was in a public place, I held back the urge to break his nose 
right here and now.

Since there wasn&#39;t anything I really could do at the moment and I knew 
that I didn&#39;t want to be in his presence any longer than needed I ran 
off, even more concerned than I had ever been. Now Mina&#39;s career wasn&#39;t 
just counting on this, her life was too! Sure she could outlive that 
jerk but if she was stuck with him for even fifty years, I doubt even 
her light could last. My light...

Was that...what the vision was warning me about?

I can&#39;t allow it to happen!

Park , after Rei leaves

&quot;Amazing what a little lie can do.&quot; Manuke chuckled to himself. &quot;Now 
she&#39;ll be so nervous, she&#39;ll be sure to screw up.&quot; Manuke&#39;s eyes then 
turned into a dark shade of red. &quot;And if that doesn&#39;t work...well...I 
have other ways Haha...HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;

Minako&#39;s POV, her apartment

Ding dong.

That must be Rei-chan.

Happily I skipped to the door and quickly opened it to see Rei staring 
at me with mixed emotions. There were so many emotions swirling in those 
amethyst eyes. Anger, sadness, confusion, happiness, but more than any, 
there was fear.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

Without a word the raven-haired priestess walked forward and wrapped her 
arms around my waist, and rested her head on my shoulder.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; I asked again.

&quot;No...&quot; I heard her take a sharp intake of breath. &quot;Let&#39;s get practicing 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve never been more serious.&quot; I shuddered at the strong will in that 
voice. Clearly there was something bothering her...and I had a feeling 
that it wasn&#39;t just the concert.

She was about to leave my embrace when I stopped her, hugging her even 
more tightly. Her body stiffened in surprise. &quot;I know there&#39;s something 
bothering you Rei...and I know you probably won&#39;t tell me but...I want 
you to know, I&#39;m here for you okay? And...that I believe in you. No 
matter what happens we&#39;ll get through it together.&quot;

Rei moved back a little and then looked into my eyes. There was 
determination reflecting in them now, pure determination.

&quot;I won&#39;t let you down.&quot;

Those simple words made my heart skip a few beats. Rei then took my hand 
and lead me to the small living room where we were about to spend hours 
practicing the routine.

Being with you makes me so happy. More than I can say. So until the day 
I can tell you, please let us stay this way.

Together.
