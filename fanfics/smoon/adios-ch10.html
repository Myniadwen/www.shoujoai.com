<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 10 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>After convincing the girls and Minako she was alright, Makoto headed 
home to tend to her wounds. 

When she reached her apartment and walked inside, she tossed her 
jacket into the arm chair absent mindedly. She heard a soft pawing at 
her balconey door and opened her floor lenght drapes to reveal a blue 
cat on the out side of the door. Makoto opened the door and allowed 
the cat to walk in befor closing and locking the door.

Makoto the walked down a small hallway, removing her sweater as she 
did, feeling the cloth pull away from her blood soaked back.

&quot;Why the hell am I so tired,&quot; Makoto demanded. She swung her bedroom 
door open and thru her shirt into a pile of dirty clothes near the end 
of her bed. She poked her head out of the room and looked at Ace. 
&quot;...Well...???&quot;

Ace smiled. &quot;Well what?&quot;

Makoto groaned and slammed the door shut. Ace sat at the end of the 
hall, counting backwards. &quot;Three...two....one..&quot;

Makoto charged out of her room and stood in front of Ace, towering 
over his cat body. &quot;You know damn well what. Now answer me.&quot;

Ace sighed and streched. The recent battle had also tired him as well. 
&quot;I honesty don&#39;t know,&quot; he said, walking back into the living room and 
jumping into the arm chair and curling up next to Makoto&#39;s still warm 
jacket. &quot;But...I may have an idea why.&quot;

Makoto looked at him. &quot;What is it,&quot; she said in a calmer tone.

&quot;Well, it may be because of-&quot;

A knocking noise made them both stop talking and look at the door. Ace 
lowered his head and closed his eyes as Makoto made her way to the 
door. Peering out thru the eye hole, she saw Minako on the other side.

Groaning slightly, Makoto opened the door. &quot;What?&quot;

Minako blinked and blushed and quickly found the floor interesting. 
&quot;I..uh...Was wondering how you were doing.&quot; 

Makoto looed at Minako wondering why she was being so quiet then 
looked down at herself and mentally smacked herself. She had forgotten 
to put a shirt back on.

&quot;I&#39;m fine, Minako.&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Is someone here with you?&quot;

&quot;Nani? What made you ask that?&quot;

Shyly, Minako raised her finger and pointed it at Makoto&#39;s chest. 
Makoto smiled. &quot;Iie, just getting ready for bed.&quot; Looking over her 
shoulder, Makoto noticed Ace had fallen asleep in her jacket. Turning 
back towards Minako, she said, &quot;Would you like to come in?&quot;

Minako shook her head. &quot;Iie. I just wanted- Makoto! Your shoulder! Its 
bleeding!&quot; Minako had looked up and saw blood from Makoto&#39;s back 
smeared on her shoulder.

&quot;Nani? Iie, its not.&quot; Makoto didn&#39;t want Minako to find out.

Minako walked in past Makoto and looked at the brunette&#39;s back before 
Makoto could protest. The apartment was still dark, but Minako could 
still make out the marks and blood. She gently rested her hand on 
Makoto&#39;s back and felt that it was damp. 

&quot;You&#39;re still bleeding.&quot;

&quot;Hai, I know.&quot; Makoto shut and locked her front door. She rested her 
head against her door, feeling Minako&#39;s ool hand on the hot skin of 
her back.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Minako said, gently remvoing her hand and tugging on 
Makoto&#39;s arm. &quot;I&#39;ll help you clean this up.&quot; Makoto allowed herself to 
be guided by Minako thru the hallway, and into her bedroom.

&quot;Lay down on your stomache,&quot; Minako said. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Minako 
then disappeared out of the bedroom and into the hall. Makoto shrugged 
and did as she was told, laying on the bed on her stomache and closed 
her eyes. She was too tired to argue.

&quot;Geez, Its nice to know everything stays the same when you move,&quot; 
Minako said, walking back into the bedroom several minutes later.

&quot;What do you mean,&quot; Makoto asked, her eyes still closed.

&quot;All of your bandages and medicine and stuff like that is still in the 
same place.&quot; Minkao sat a bottle of asprin, gauze, tape, a wash cloth 
and some cold cream medicince. &quot;I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Makoto nodded.

Makoto heard Minako leave her room. Several minutes later she could 
hear runnig water in her kitchen. She could then hear Minako walking 
back to the room, a small noise that sounded like water sloshing 
against a wall.

Makoto opened her eyes when a few drops of water hit her face. &quot;Whats 
the bowl of water for?&quot;

&quot;For me to clean your back,&quot; Minako said, sitting next to Makoto on 
the bed, opeing the asprin bottle.

&quot;Ok...Whats the glass of water for?&quot;

&quot;For you to take these pills. I know your back has to be killing you,&quot; 
Minako said, handing Makoto two little white pills and the glass of 
water. Makoto popped the pills into her mouth and Minako held the 
glass for her as she drank.

When Makoto was finshed with the water, Minako sat the glass back down 
onto the night stand. Makoto placed her arms under a pillow and 
propped it up for her head to rest on, and closed her eyes once again, 
fully trusting Minako.

Makoto could feel Minako move and then felt something warm hit her 
back. Makot arched slightly and hissed thru chenched teeth.

&quot;Gomen ne, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said quietly. &quot;I need to clean your back 
of the blood before I can bandage it.&quot;

Makoto nodded, her heart beating quickly from the pain. She felt 
Minako gently wipe her back in smooth, even strokes. The movements, 
although somewhat painful, were lulling Makoto to sleep.

Minako smiled as she heard slight snoring coming from Makoto. Being 
bold and leaning over she kissed Makoto&#39;s ear. &quot;Don&#39;t go to sleep.&quot;

Makoto muffled something Minako could not hear and her slowly 
opened.&quot;Err,...Why not?&quot;

&quot;Uh...&quot; Minako continued to gently clean Makoto&#39;s back. &quot;How did you 
get these cuts? Ami said you only hit the wall.&quot; 

&quot;I did. Very hard,&quot; Makoto lied.

&quot;No you didn&#39;t. Not that hard.&quot;

&quot;It was a brick wall. A very coarse, brick wall.&quot; The tone Makoto was 
using was a warning to Minako not to push it.

&quot;Ok, Ok. Makoto?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Can I unsnap your bra?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes snapped open again. &quot;Nani?!&quot;

&quot;I need to finish your back, but your bra is in the way.&quot;

&quot;Oh. Um...yea, sure.&quot; Makoto felt shaking fingers unclasp her bra. 
Makoto leaned up slightly to remove the straps from her shoulders. She 
smiled knowing Minako&#39;s face was probably beet red.

Minako quickly yet gently finished cleaning Makoto&#39;s back and 
shoulders. Placing the rag into the bowl of water, Minako got a good 
look at Makoto&#39;s back.

&quot;Its not that bad,&quot; Minako whispered.

Makoto nodded. 

Minako&#39;s eyes caught sight of something she hadn&#39;t noticed before. She 
cool hands once again fell onto Makoto&#39;s warm skin at the small of her 
back. 

&quot;When did you get this done,&quot; Minako asked, tracing the mirrored image 
of herself as Sailor V Makoto had tattooed on her back.

&quot;About two months after you...&quot; Makoto trailed off. &quot;...Left. The rest 
of the work with the hearts was done later.&quot;

Minako nodded and blinked back tears. She quietly applied the cold 
cream and the guaze bandages, and them secured them using the medical 
tape.

Makoto moved her stiff back muscles. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot; Minako then cleaned up the mess she had made while 
cleaning Makoto&#39;s back. She left the room and came back a few moments 
later and stood in the door way. &quot;I think...I&#39;m gonna go now.&quot;

Makoto turned her head to look at Minako. Makoto noticed somethong 
about Minako.

She seemed scared.

&quot;Minako?..&quot;

Minako looked up, tears in her eyes. 

&quot;Makoto...&quot;

Modesty be dammned, Makoto jumped up from the bed with strenghth she 
didn&#39;t know she had left and caught Minako as she broke down into 
tears. Makoto gently wrapped her arms around Minako tightly.

Makoto lowered them both to the floor and gently rocked Minako back 
and forth, lightly rubbing her back.

&quot;Mina? Minako, whats wrong?&quot;

Minako continued to cry and in between sobs said, &quot;Makoto..I am 
so...sorry for ....for what I&#39;ve done to you...&quot; More tears exploded 
from the blonde&#39;s eyes her arms snaking around to hold Makoto around 
the waist, being careful not to hit her back.

&quot;For what, baby? You haven&#39;t done anything.&quot;

&quot;Yes I have. I was so mean to you those years ago when I 
disappeared..&quot;

Makoto&#39;s mind went blank and her heart lept up into her throat.

&quot;... I didn&#39;t mean...I wanted to tell you....I was on my way back to 
your aparment after the warehouse exploaded. I just...didn&#39;t think..&quot;

&quot;Nani? You didn&#39;t think what?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d want to see me...&quot; Minako&#39;s sobs were slowing, 
now she was getting a slight case of hiccups from the tears.

Makoto was silent for a few moments. &quot;Why,..would you think that?&quot;

&quot;I saw Alan and you...I was standing on the balconey of your 
apartment....&quot;

Makoto&#39;s mind snapped back to the memory of that night. Alan had been 
the one to tell Makoto that Minako had died in the explosian....and 
then he hugged her.

&quot;You don&#39;t think he hugged me because I liked him do you?&quot; Minako 
nodded. 

&quot;Iie!&quot; Makoto hugged Minako tighter. &quot;Iie..He hugged me because I 
collapsed in the floor. He told me you had died and I just fell to the 
floor.&quot; Makoto rested her chin on Minkao&#39;s head, tears falling from 
her eyes. &quot;You didn&#39;t see that did you?&quot;

&quot;Iie...&quot; Minako said quieltly.

&quot;No..&quot; Makoto hugged Minako tighter. &quot;When I thought I lost you...I 
nearly went crazy. I was really depressed...I have been in love with 
you for years. And that one night....It was a dream come true for me. 
And when Alan had told me you died...&quot;

Minako&#39;s grasp tighend around Makoto. She brought her head up to lay 
her chin on Makoto&#39;s shoulder. She then remebered Makoto was completly 
topless, but didn&#39;t care. &quot;Yea..?&quot;

Makoto lowered her head and laid her forhead on Minako&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I 
was really scared...I thought so many times it was my fault because I 
didnt wake up...I thought maybe if I had woken up when you had, I 
could have helped you and you would still be alive...&quot; Makoto pulled 
Minako closer to her, tears falling from her eyes. &quot;I just wish..I had 
done something different that night...&quot;

&quot;Demo, Mako...I lived it....&quot;

&quot;But how was I suppossed to know that? I finally got use to the fact 
you were gone...and when Rei sent me a photo of her and her 
friends...I saw you...and my mind has since been blank...I&#39;ve been 
very slowly trying to replace my mind and heart back together.&quot;

Minako pulled away slightly and cupped Makoto&#39;s face with both hands 
and looked into her eyes. &quot;I&#39;m so sorry for what I&#39;ve done to you. I 
was young and stupid and when I saw you and Alan it hurt and I thought 
he was your big crush...But I&#39;m wrong, aren&#39;t I?&quot; Makoto&#39;s eyes fell 
as she nodded slightly. 

Minako smiled slightly. &quot;It was me, wasn&#39;t?&quot;

&quot;Still is you...&quot; Makoto said so quietly, Minako nearly missed it.

&quot;I love you, Mako-chan. It took me years and seeing you again to 
realize it. And I wish now that I hadn&#39;t run out on you.&quot; 

Makoto&#39;s face was still looking downward. She closed her eyes tightly 
as tears flowed down her face. Mianko gently wrapped her arms arounf 
Makoto&#39;s head and shoulders cradeling Makoto&#39;s head close to her 
chest. Makoto&#39;s hands dropped from Minako&#39;s back to her hips as she 
allowed Minako cradel her head.

Minako gently petted Makoto&#39;s hair until she finally calmed down. 
Minako kissed the top of Makoto&#39;s head and raised her face to meet her 
eyes once again. Minako&#39;s thumbs wiped away Makoto&#39;s tears.

Smiling shyly, Minako asked,&quot; Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Would you like to start all over?..&quot;

&quot;Start over?&quot;

Minako sighed at her loss of words. &quot;Not really start over, 
but....pick up where we left off five years ago?&quot;

Makoto&#39;s hands gently squeezed Minako&#39;s hips and Minako sighed 
slightly but shook her head. 

&quot;Are you sure,&quot; Makoto asked. &quot;What about your boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;Mashou?&quot; Makoto nodded. &quot;I had planned on breaking up with him. I 
like him, but...I know I&#39;ll never be able to love him like I do you.&quot;

&quot;Are you sure,&quot; Makoto asked, bringing her hands up to rest on 
Minako&#39;s neck gently.

Give me all your tears
Let me turn them into pearls

Minako nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; Minako finalized her answer by leaning forward 
and gently placing her lips on Makoto&#39;s. Makoto kissed back gently, 
afarid Minako may run off again. 

Makoto gently squeezed Minako&#39;s shoulders, and Minako moaned into 
Makoto&#39;s mouth. Minako&#39;s arms completely wrapped around Makoto&#39;s neck 
and shoulders. Makoto&#39;s hands dropped to Minako&#39;s back, pulling her 
closer. 

Let me turn all the tears that you&#39;ve cried onto pearls 
Hand them to me 
I&#39;m gonna keep, keep them for you 

Makoto pulled Minako up into a standing postion, closing the bedroom 
door with one hand.

The two broke for air, and gazed into the other&#39;s eyes. Makoto let her 
fingers trace Minako&#39;s face lightly.

&quot;Are you sure about this, Minako,&quot; Makoto asked, leaning her forhead 
against the blonde&#39;s. &quot;You know things will change...&quot;

Minako looked down at the floor as if in thought, then turned her face 
back up towards Makoto. &quot;They already have.&quot; Minako turned slightly to 
flip Makoto&#39;s bedroom light off before kissing her deeply once again. 

I want to hold you. 
I want to kiss you. 

Minako gently pushed Makoto back onto the bed, still trying to 
becareful of her back. Makoto smiled into the dark as she felt Minako 
crawl up to her on her hands and knees, stradeling Makoto&#39;s legs. 

Minako smiled at Makoto as she tipped her head down to kiss her chin 
then lips. Makoto, bracing herself up with one hand, cupped Minako&#39;s 
cheek with the other.

Makoto moved back slightly, Minako follwoing her, until her back was 
pressed against the head board. Minako smiled once more, kissing 
Makoto deeply, still stradeling Makoto&#39;s hips.

Minako pulled away slightly, sesning Makoto&#39;s emotions thru their 
kisses. 

Cupping the amazon&#39;s face, Minako reasurred her, &quot;Mako-chan...I know 
what I did caused you pain. But I was a kid then. I&#39;m different 
now...And I love you and I want nothing more than to be with you. 
Trust me?&quot;

Makoto nodded slightly and leaned forward to kiss Minako once again.

I want to mend what is broken 
Love me the way you loved her - please 
Cause now I&#39;m giving it all - 

Makoto removed Minako&#39;s shirt and bra and kissed her shoulders gently. 
Her hands ran courses up and down Minako&#39;s sides. Makoto gently nipped 
at Minako&#39;s shoulder, gaining a small moan from her. Makoto&#39;s hands 
gently yet firmly rubbed Minako&#39;s sides, gaining yet another moan from 
the smaller girl.

And so I&#39;ve made up my mind 
I&#39;m gonna be yours this time 

Makoto flipped Minako over onto the bed, kissing her once more before 
traveling downward, planting soft kisses as she went. Minako&#39;s hands 
went to Makoto&#39;s back roughly and Makoto flinched.

Minako blinked and quickly apologized. &quot;Gomen ne, Mako-chan! I didn&#39;t 
mean-&quot; Makoto silenced her with a kiss. 

&quot;Its ok.&quot; Makoto kissed Minako once more before turning her lips back 
towards their original goal. Kissing Minakos collar bone and nipping 
at it, Makoto traveled down further still and gently kissed one of 
Minako&#39;s nipples. Minako moaned and arched up at Makoto&#39;s mouth as 
Makoto gently took the small bud into her mouth and gently suckeled 
it. 

I&#39;m gonna give what I&#39;ve got 
And get your love in return 

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako&#39;s hands roughly scratched Makoto&#39;s shoulders and Makoto nibbled 
on one of her breasts, her calloused hand gently massaging the other. 

Minako&#39;s legs wrapped themselfs around Makoto&#39;s midsection, pulling 
her closer to her own body. Minako rolled her hips up and Makoto 
groaned slightly, biting Minako&#39;s nipple.

And so I&#39;ve made up my mind 
I&#39;m gonna be yours this time 
I&#39;m gonna teach you to trust 
And learn how to burn, 

Makoto leaned up and gently kissed Minako&#39;s lips. Minako opened her 
eyes and looked at Makoto&#39;s face.

&quot;I love you, Mako-chan...&quot;

Experience pearls 

Minako flipped Makoto over and kissed her hungerily. Makoto winced 
slightly from the pain, but pushed the burning sensation of her back 
out of her mind. Instead, she concentrated on the burning sensation 
between her legs.

Minako&#39;s hands gently traveled up and down Makoto&#39;s body, her nails 
gently dragging on the amazon&#39;s skin. Minako pulled on Makoto&#39;s lower 
lip teasingly before letting go and smiling down at her. Makoto&#39;s face 
was flushed slighty, and her breathing was irreagular.

Minako smiled once again as her head dipped down and caught a nipple 
in her mouth and sucked on it roughly. Makoto moaned and arched up at 
Minako&#39;s mouth, her hands grabbing the blonde&#39;s shoulders.

Minako kneaded one breast on her hand while her mouth suckeled the 
other. Her free hand lightly dragged its way down Makoto&#39;s side, 
slididng over to her stomache then lower to the apex between her 
thighs. 

Makoto&#39;s moans grew louder as Minako&#39;s hand pushed up roughly at 
Makoto&#39;s sex. Minako leaned up and kissed Makoto gently then she 
pulled away, looking into Makoto&#39;s deep green eyes.

&quot;...And I won&#39;t ever hurt you again.&quot;

When sand strikes up in your eyes 
I will cover your face 
I&#39;ll plant your desert with roses 
And I&#39;m gonna keep, keep them for you 

Minako kissed her way back down Makoto&#39;s body, suckeling at her neck 
and shoulders as her hands made quick work of Makoto&#39;s belt. Smiling, 
Minako leaned up and drew the belt from the loops of the jeans and 
casted the belt aside. Leaning back down for another breath taking 
kiss, Minako undid Makoto&#39;s jeans, sliding them down her hips as far 
as her hands would let her without breaking the kiss.

When air was needed, Minako released Makoto&#39;s lips and slid down her 
body, planting kisses as she went and also removining the older 
woman&#39;s pants. Minako giggled when she saw Makoto&#39;s underwear.

&quot;Orange boxers?&quot;

Makoto laughed slightly and shrugged. 

Minako smiled more and lowered her face to Makoto&#39;s wet sex and gently 
placed a kiss there. Makoto bucked slightly and closed her eyes, 
sighing with happiness. This was what she wanted. 

And all that she would ever need.

And so I&#39;ve made up my mind 
I&#39;m gonna be yours this time 

Makoto moaned louldy as Minako slid two fingers deep inside her. She 
bucked her hips in time with Minako&#39;s movements, moaning louder each 
time Minako went deeper. 

Minako leaned up and suckeld at Makoto&#39;s breasts as her fingers 
continued to move in and out of Makoto slowly, then fast, then slow 
once again. Her thumb would brush up against Makoto&#39;s nub every few 
thrusts, smiling proudly when she heard Makoto moan her name.

I&#39;m gonna give what I&#39;ve got 
And get your love in return 

Makoto gripped the sheets tightly and screamed Minako&#39;s name as orgasm 
took her. Minako&#39;s fingers had brought her over the edge. And although 
this was not her first orgasm, it felt just as wonderful.

And so I&#39;ve made up my mind 
I&#39;m gonna be yours this time 
I&#39;m gonna teach you to trust 
And learn how to burn, 

Minako kissed her way back up Makoto&#39;s body and then laid next to, her 
head resting on the amazon&#39;s heaving chest. She licked her fingers 
clean before resting her hand on Makoto&#39;s toned body. 

One of Makoto&#39;s arms came to rest around Minako&#39;s shoulders as she 
came down from her wonderful high.

Experience pearls 

After catching her breath, Makoto forcefully turned and kissed Minako 
deeply, her free hand resting on Minako&#39;s thigh. Makoto&#39;s hand that 
was resting on Minako&#39;s shoulder pulled at her, brining the wto 
closer, deeping their kiss. Minako&#39;s arms were tucked between their 
bodies.

Makoto&#39;s hand that rested at Minako&#39;s thigh traveled downward then 
back up, snaking its way under Minako&#39;s skirt. Minako pressed herself 
up against Makoto&#39;s wondering hand, growling in the back of her throat 
as Makoto&#39;s hand pulled her cotton panties down her legs. 

Minako broke the kiss long enough to catch her breath before crushing 
her lips back down on Makoto&#39;s. She kicked her panties off, she spread 
her legs slightly to allow Makoto&#39;s fingers to probe gently within 
her.

Minako broke the kiss once again, her head lulling back, moaning 
loudly. Makoto removed her hand from Minako&#39;s shoulders, allowing to 
fall at the blonde&#39;s hip instead. Makoto caught Minako&#39;s lips again 
and kissed her gently as her fingers probed deeper and deeper.

Minako moaned deeply into the kiss. Her hands snaked out from between 
their bodies and she held onto Makoto around the waist and back. 
Makoto pushed her fingers harder into Minako and Minako moaned louder 
and cried out slightly from pleasure. Her nails dug into Makoto&#39;s back 
and Makoto flinched.

I&#39;ll wear yours pearls more precious than silver 
I&#39;ll wear your pearls so close to my skin 
I&#39;d tear myself apart just to get you - 

Minako wimpered as Makoto withdrew her fingers. She had her eyes 
closed, but could feel Makoto move then felt her skirt being tugged 
at. She then felt the material being removed as she felt hot breath 
against her belly. She shivered slightly when she felt Makoto kiss her 
mound then flick her tounge over her clit.

Minako bucked up from the bed, her fingers becoming entangled in 
Makoto&#39;s brown hair. She moaned and cried out as she felt Makoto&#39;s 
tounge flick over her sex, then slide into her, then back out again.

Makoto moved up to Minako&#39;s nub and suckeled it, Minako groaning 
loudly. Makoto&#39;s hands held Mianko&#39;s hips in place as she sweetly 
tourtured her girl friend. 

Minako threw her head back, her small frame racking with orgasm. 
Makoto licked at Minako until she was done bucking and then crawled up 
beside her. 

Minako caught her breath and turned her head and smiled at Makoto who 
returned it. Minako leaned over and kissed Makoto&#39;s nose. Makoto 
laughed and Minako giggled.

And so I&#39;ve made up my mind.... 

After a few hours of love making, Minako found herself lying in 
Makoto&#39;s arms. She nuzzled the taller girl&#39;s neck and smiled when she 
was rewarded with a very rare giggle from the always tomboyish amazon.

&quot;Minako?&quot;

Minako smiled and closed her eyes, content with hearing Makoto&#39;s 
heartbeat. &quot;Hai?&#39;

Makoto moved her lips to Minako&#39;s ear.
