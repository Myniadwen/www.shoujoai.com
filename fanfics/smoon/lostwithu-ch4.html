<p><strong>Tokyo airport, 9.26 AM.</strong></p>
<p><em>It wasn't a raining day. But  it should have been. There should have been rain wetting the streets.  Wetting cars. Wetting that window. There should have been rain wetting  that city to match the tears that were wetting her cheeks, rolling down  her neck and eventually soaking up in her shirt's collar.</em></p>
<p><em>'But  it's not a movie.' She thought chuckling. 'If it was a movie then he  will arrive and we will end up kissing in the rain with beautiful music  in the background.'</em></p>
<p><em>The tall brunette laughed softly even if she was alone and people passing by glanced at her suspiciously.</em></p>
<p><em>'There's  nothing to laugh at. You let someone fool you again. He won't come...  besides it was kinda foolish to even think he would have.' Her inner  voice was scolding again in its annoying usual way. And she knew that  it was damn right, but she couldn't help it. She had to wait till the  end, she couldn't give up the hope. Never.</em></p>
<p><em>'If I stay till  the end then it won't be my fault...' She said to herself and she  remained there, with tears-streaked cheeks, looking out of the large  window, scanning everyone who was about to enter the large hall.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I know he won't come. I </em>let <em>him  fool me. I. Let. Him... cause I wanted to.&quot; She murmured with her hands  flat on the glass and her breath misting up the surface around her full  lips. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>'If you say so...' Her inner voice said unconvinced.

<p><strong>In the middle of the Pacific Ocean, present.</strong></p>
<p>'There's  something there!' Umino whispered and stood slowly. As he had put on  his thick glasses he turned towards the spot where the noise that had  waken him up came from. He saw bushes shaking at the edge of the woods,  but he couldn't tell what was the cause in the dim light of the  impending dawn. He wasn't too anxious to go and see. The account of the  journey to the cockpit was scary enough to not go near the woods if not  strictly necessary.</p>
<p>Fortunately for him, Umino hadn't been the  only one waken by the noise. Soon Seiya and Darien were by his side. No  one dared to say a word. Soon the bushes near the crashed airframe  shook again.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we do?&quot; Seiya asked Darien in a whisper.</p>
<p>The  short haired man didn't answer, he just stood there looking in the  distance at the bushes. Seiya couldn't tell if he was thinking or he  was petrified by terror. Then Darien turned around and glanced at the  sleeping forms of his girlfriend and her best-friend.</p>
<p>GRUNT GRUNT</p>
<p>The animal-like noises intensified and a cold bead of sweat ran down the three men's backs.</p>
<p>GRUNT</p>
<p>&quot;They're probably more scared than you three are.&quot;</p>
<p>Umino and Seiya were just startled as Darien tried to understand what had been said - his Japanese was still in training.</p>
<p>The  short, bald man approached them from behind and smiled at their  surprise. He was settling his clothes and his pace was slow and calm.  He laughed mocking and Seiya begun to get annoyed. What did that old,  stale little man want?</p>
<p>&quot;It's not what you think it is, but I  suggest not to go anywhere near them. The mother could get a little  touchy...&quot; He trailed off chuckling.</p>
<p>GRUNT GRUNT GRUNT</p>
<p>Just  as the old man made his way to his makeshift pallet something brownish  and grunting came out of the wood and ran to the wrecked airframe.  Umino, Seiya and Darien were startled until they saw it was some sort  of furry... pig?</p>
<p>&quot;Wart-hogs.&quot; Umino stated and they could see the  animals were five, one was big – probably the mother – and four little  cubs were behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;How cute!&quot; Came Serena's high-pitched voice even if a little still sleepy.</p>
<p>&quot;You  sure weren't scared by a bunch of little puppies, were you?&quot; Mina added  with a suggesting tone. She came closer and grabbed Seiya's arm before  adding, &quot;Three big boys and four very little furry cubs...&quot; The three  men sweatdropped at her sensual tone until she couldn't hold herself  any more and burst out in laughter, followed quickly by Serena.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  first rays of the morning sun found a standing Haruka watching Hotaru  sleeping peacefully – at last – nestled against Michiru. That was an  extremely sweet view but Haruka's face wasn't wearing the predictable  tender smile. Her brows were furrowed in a deep frown, her lips a thin  line and her eyes anguished.
<p>&quot;It's hard.&quot; That statement could have  been whispered by the wind itself, so Haruka didn't turn to see if  someone was there. Thoughts, regrets and a lot of not-so-pleasant  things were chasing around in her tired mind. But when the voice spoke  again she couldn't deny its existence and she even realized whose that  voice was.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to not being able to run away, isn't it? But there are decisions that need to be made. It's necessary.&quot; Setsuna said.</p>
<p>Haruka  was too tired to dwell on the fact that that woman always knew what was  in her mind, she was too tired to try an answer. She just stood there  silently.</p>
<p>&quot;He would have died anyway.&quot; That was said with such  certainty that Haruka actually believed it for a minute. &quot;It's not time  for you to choose between one life versus many lives... <em>yet</em>.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka's  eyes went wide in surprise. She turned to look at the elder woman. The  unreadable expression on her tanned face didn't falter despite the  killing glare Haruka gave her. Their looks remained locked for a couple  of minutes then the fuming Haruka broke eye-contact and walked away.</p>
<p>Setsuna looked down at the two sleeping figures again and shook her head.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  all wrong. It wasn't supposed to be this way.&quot; She murmured. In her  hand there was the letter addressed to Prof. S. Tomoe and a couple of  voided plane-tickets.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A hour later the bright sunlight had succeeded in waking up everyone and the little parcel of beach started its day.
<p>When  Haruka entered the tent to catch something to eat for the just waken  Hotaru she ran into Ami. The girl stood in the middle of the tent  looking intently at the pallet where Souchi had laid until a couple of  hours ago. She didn't want to disturb the blue-haired girl so she made  her way to the blue box silently.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-san, how is  Hotaru-chan?&quot; The question came unexpectedly and the car-racer looked  up at Ami in surprise before answering.</p>
<p>&quot;She's still sad, but I  think she's ok. I'm gonna bring her... something... to... eat.&quot; She  paused looking down into the thermal-box.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, there's no much left, is it? And the water too.&quot; Ami was worried and she couldn't help but shake her head discouraged.</p>
<p>&quot;We  will think up something.&quot; Haruka said calmly. Ami seemed to accept her  reassurance so the blonde stood and walked to the tent's entrance. Then  Ami's voice made her stop in her tracks.</p>
<p>&quot;You didn't say they'll  come.&quot; The blue-haired girl's voice was expressionless, &quot;It's up to us  and us only, isn't it? No one is gonna come for us.&quot; Haruka didn't  reply, she just stepped out of the tent without looking at the younger  girl behind her.</p>
<p>When she was out she walked slowly to what had  become Setsuna's, Hotaru's and her spot. On her way she met with  Michiru who was coming back after checking on what were her  travel-mates: the three Kou brothers.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey there. What will  Hotaru have for breakfast?&quot; The violinist said grabbing Haruka's arm  and lifting it to take a look. &quot;Mmh... eggplant-sandwich. Yummy!&quot;  Michiru tried to lighten Haruka's obviously bad mood.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it  was eggplants or spinach. I'll have to lodge a complaint to the  'Thermal-box Supermarket'. They don't seem to be well supplied.&quot; Was  the caustic reply.</p>
<p>&quot;We're running out of food, aren't we?&quot; The aqua-haired woman asked serious.</p>
<p>&quot;Noooo, it's just I think children <em>love</em> eggplants.&quot; The bitter sarcasm pierced Michiru and she fell silent.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry.&quot;  Haruka realized immediately how harsh her reply had been. &quot;Too much  stress for what was supposed to be a two-days trip to New York.&quot; She  smiled at the smaller girl, and this time without mordancy.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah,  and too little sleep.&quot; Michiru added noticing the dark circle around  the blonde's eyes. Then they reached Hotaru and Setsuna sitting in  silence.</p>
<p>&quot;Here's your breakfast, Hime-chan. I know, it's purple  and apparently nothing edible but you have to eat something.&quot; Haruka's  precautionary speech was either very convincing or just unnecessary  cause the little girl grabbed the sandwich in silence and started  eating diligently.</p>
<p>After a couple of bites the child lifted her head that was red with embarrassment and said a 'chomping' 'Thank you'.</p>
<p>&quot;You're welcome Hotaru-hime.&quot; Said Haruka smiling and tousling the black hair on the little head.</p>
<p>They sat there in silence until the little girl had finished eating. Then Haruka lent her a small bottle of water.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  drink it up all of that cause it has to last until tomorrow.&quot; Those  words were like stones for the other two adults. They could resist  running out of food, but they needed water.</p>
<p>Hotaru took obediently just a couple of sips, then she handed Haruka back the bottle.</p>
<p>After  that the silence fell again among the small group and it was broke only  by a half-suppressed sob. The three women all looked at the child and  saw her little frame shaking. Those little shoulders trembled under the  heavy sobs.</p>
<p>Haruka and Michiru was soon kneeled by Hotaru's side,  caressing her back lovingly. Then the kid lifted her head and looked at  them with teary purple eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I miss him.&quot; There were her simple  words, but they were enough to brake their hearts. They could only  embrace her tightly hoping to reassure her she wasn't alone.</p>
<p>After  a little while Hotaru stopped crying and disengaged herself from that  lovely embrace. She sat in front of the two women and looked them with  a serious expression on her tears streaked face.</p>
<p>&quot;Can I ask you a favor?&quot; She said never braking their eye-contact.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course you can, Hime-chan.&quot; Michiru replied smiling sweetly.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; Was Haruka's equally gentle but shorter answer.</p>
<p>&quot;I've  never met my mama and I know she's my real mom, but...&quot; she dropped her  eyes suddenly self-conscious, then after a minute she continued, &quot;Can I  call you... can I call you Michiru-mama?&quot; Her eyes were pleading.</p>
<p>Michiru's  face was lit up by a huge smile even if her eyes were already full of  tears. &quot;Of course you can. I will be very happy if you would.&quot; Then she  leant down to hug the little girl.</p>
<p>After a minute she disentangled from Michiru with urgency, like she couldn't hold herself back.</p>
<p>&quot;Can  I call you Papa, Haruka-san?&quot; This time Hotaru's voice was  high-pitched. She had drained her emotional resources and stress had  got the better of her, she was sobbing again uncontrollably. She  dropped her head ashamed at her outburst and suddenly she didn't look  like the little girl she was.</p>
<p>The blonde reached out and lifted  the little girl's chin with her hand, then she locked her teal eyes  with Hotaru's purple ones and she looked at her earnestly.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a honor, Hime-chan.&quot; Then she smiled to reassure the little girl.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Behind  them Setsuna smiled knowingly and a bit of tenderness passed through  her eyes. 'At least some things never change.' She thought as she  looked at the new-formed - and kinda peculiar – family.
<p>&quot;Hey! Hey you can't!&quot; The shouts came from the back of the doctor's tent and soon drawn there most of the survivors.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't  get in my way, Jap.&quot; Jade glared at Yaten and stepped towards the  silver-haired young man who had his arms stretched out and was trying  to block the other's way.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the matter here?&quot; Darien asked  when he arrived. Just then Jade tried to pass over Yaten and when he  realized he couldn't he just pushed the shorter man aside. Yaten fell  on the ground surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Take your hands off my brother!&quot; Seiya  threw himself at the long haired man and he was about to start a fight  when he was suddenly held back by Haruka and Darien. He struggled when  they took him off of the older man but then he calmed down and they let  him go.</p>
<p>&quot;He has taken too much. At least two times his ration.&quot; Accused Yaten. All eyes were then on Jade who shrugged.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm hungry.&quot; He stated holding their looks.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on, give back the excess and we could all return to our activities.&quot; Darien said calmly.</p>
<p>&quot;Fuck you, fop.&quot; Jade spat out then turned around.</p>
<p>&quot;It'd be better if you do what he said to.&quot; Taiki said with an icy tone.</p>
<p>&quot;I was going to give him a lesson!&quot; Seiya mumbled, hardly holding back himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Give the excess back. Now.&quot; Haruka ordered, hardness in her voice.</p>
<p>Jade  turned back again and saw the tall blonde, six men and four women all  looking angrily at him so he decided to give up. He lifted his hand  with its content and opened it letting the already unpacked sandwich  fall on the sand then he walked off.</p>
<p>&quot;Son of a-...&quot; Seiya was held back again by Haruka and Taiki this time.</p>
<p>&quot;Let  him go, he's not worth it.&quot; Taiki's reasonable words needed a couple of  seconds to sink in Seiya's mind, then he calmed down again.</p>
<p>Rei  picked up the piece of bread and tried to brush the sand off of it.  When she was satisfied with her work she silently walked to the  thermal-box and put the offended item back in.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to do something about that.&quot; Darien said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, tie him up to a tree and let him dry off under the sun.&quot; Seiya said angrily.</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya-kun!&quot;  Taiki scolded him and Michiru went beside him and touched his arm to  make him calm down. He smiled at her touch and felt suddenly compelled  to send a triumphant look towards Haruka.</p>
<p>The car-racer was  massaging her shoulder slightly strained in the effort to hold Seiya  back. When she noticed his look she glared back at him. Then she  thought that that was how things were supposed to be, with Michiru  being with Seiya.</p>
<p>'It's not like we have something in common at  all.' She thought referring to the aqua-haired beauty. But then an  image of two sleeping Michiru and Hotaru snuggled together flashed  through her mind.</p>
<p>&quot;My grandfather says we should hunt the wart-hogs.&quot; Rei intervened. The short, bald man was right behind her.</p>
<p>&quot;And how can we do that?&quot; Seiya inquired dubious.</p>
<p>&quot;I  can do it. I just need two good runners... and a knife. I saw she has  more than one blade.&quot; He said pointing at Lita. Rei translated her  grandfather's sentence for Darien, Serena, Mina and Lita.</p>
<p>All the  eyes turned to the tall brunette and she blushed at the sudden  attention. Then she nodded and a nervous smile spread slowly on her  face.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course.&quot; She said finally.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;So,  don't you think this is a wonderful way to use a knife?&quot; The  gray-haired man asked her while slicing expertly a tomato. The sharp  blade penetrating smoothly in the red fruit without any hesitation in  quick movements. In half a minute he had the tomato in little pieces  and put it in the big pan. A loud sizzled could be heard and a  delicious aroma spread into the air.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Oh yes.&quot; Lita said  looking fascinated as he took another tomato and started slicing it the  same way. &quot;Can... can I try?&quot; She asked hopefully.</em></p>
<p><em>The  chef looked at his promising young pupil. She was passionate and  dedicated to the art of cooking and very talented. Course, she was a  little blunt sometimes, and she needed to be refined, but she sure had  a future. Despite her past.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Of course.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Lita  took the big knife in her strong though young hands and began slicing a  tomato with more enthusiasm than skill, but soon she followed her  teacher's instructions and her technique improved by minutes.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>She smiled as she became aware that she was doing something she truly loved to do and she was learning to do it very, very well.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you sure? It's dangerous, Seiya-kun.&quot; Michiru said to the black-haired  young man. She helped him to adjust the small rucksack on his shoulders.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know, but we have to do this. Besides...&quot; He glanced to his left and  shot a burning glint to Haruka who was equally getting ready.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  come on! Don't tell me you're doing it just out of a childish rivalry.&quot;  Michiru rolled her eyes. He could be such a big baby sometimes. &quot;It  isn't a game, Seiya. We don't know what's in there but we know all too  well what it's capable of.&quot; She was truly concerned and she knew that  in a corner of her mind she was also truly concerned for someone other  than Seiya.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone has to do it or we'll starve to death. And it's not childish rivalry. I <em>can</em> do it.&quot; He replied firmly. His pride was talking and he knew it. During  the last two days, though the situation, he had only been able to think  about how much time Michiru had spent with the blonde and how much she  seemed to care for her and that little girl... but she was supposed to  care for him and for his brothers. <em>They</em> were her friends and he had hoped he could be something more than that.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey,  you can't fool me. I know that look. It's the same look you have when  someone challenges you... but nobody has challenged you this time.&quot; The  violinist said knowingly.</p>
<p>But she couldn't understand, could she?  She wasn't the one risking to loose her pride. No one could ever doubt  her... While he had to demonstrate his value every single day.</p>
<p>&quot;She butted in without a reason... it was my brother who was done a wrong to.&quot; The singer proclaimed with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;She  did you a favor, along with Darien-san. I don't think it'd be wise to  fight with that Jade-guy. He looks like nothing good.&quot; Michiru said,  admitting her worries.</p>
<p>&quot;It was my brother and she's always acting  like she's the hero here. But, guess what, we're all survived to that  wreck and we're all doing our best to remain alive. She's nothing  special.&quot; He was angry and overreacting, and Michiru didn't know what  to do to calm him. She guessed it wasn't just about the happenings of  that morning, but something else was troubling him.</p>
<p>&quot;I really  don't think she consider herself something special, quite the  opposite!&quot; Michiru felt uncomfortable hearing those unfair words about  Haruka and she tried to dismiss quickly the knowledge of that feeling.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, how can you say that now!&quot; Seiya was turning from irritated to upset.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  I know that. We... we talked.&quot; She said that softly, like she was...  guilty? 'This is ridiculous! Why should I feel guilty about talking  with someone?' She thought, and she too was starting to upset. &quot;Then  go! Go ahead and get yourself killed, then you'll be happy with your  machismo. Who cares if we remain here waiting? Your fucking pride will  be saved, who cares about us?&quot; Michiru snapped. The black-haired  pop-singer looked at her wide-eyed, her elegant friend had just  cursed... then he realized they were both overreacting and tried to  calm her down.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry Michiru-chan. I think we're just stressed.&quot; He said with softening voice.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know... It's just that... If you have to do it, Seiya-kun, do it cause  we're running out of food and not cause you're... what? Jealous? It's  not worth it.&quot; She too said that with a softened expression gracing her  beautiful features. &quot;Try to take care, ok?&quot; She patted his arm and  smiled.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course. See you later, cutie.&quot; He winked at her and smiling made his way to Rei's grandfather.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;I  know it's necessary. But try to take care, ok?&quot; Setsuna's words sounded  strangely sincere. Though she was unreadable most of the time,  sometimes you could see true emotion behind her speeches. And cause it  was a quite rare happening you were prone to cherish those words. So  Haruka smiled at the tanned woman and nodded without a hint of  mistrust. Then she turned to the blonde man who had a strange item in  his hands and looked quite anxious.
<p>&quot;Here's the antenna. I made it  out of the electronic items we collected yesterday. I hope we could  receive again from the same source we received from the day before  yesterday - or even another one - and we could transmit something.&quot;  Furuhata said with evident anxiousness but equally evident hope. Haruka  admired the young man for his capability to hope no matter what they  had seen, no matter what they – just the two of them – had heard the  pilot saying.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok, what are we suppose to do with it?&quot; She asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Just  put it on a tree when you're sufficiently deep in the wood. The higher  you can place it, the higher our chances to receive will be. But  there's no need to risk and fall cause I think the signal is rather  strong. Good luck Haruka-san.&quot; He concluded smiling at her.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you Furuhata-san.&quot; She then was about to walk away to reach the other two when she heard someone calling her name.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka! Wait!&quot;</p>
<p>The  car-racer turned to see Michiru rapidly approaching her. She stopped  and waited for the violinist to arrive. The aqua-haired woman had a  worried expression on her face but by the time she was in front of her,  she was smiling even if it looked like a forced smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, try  to take care, don't make me a single mother before time.&quot; The joke,  though it was quite morbid, brought a sincere smile on Haruka's pale  face. She didn't knew if it was cause of the joke itself or just for  the implied relationship it hinted.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll try. After all I've no  intention to quit my father-role after only a couple of hours. It would  be rude.&quot; She winked. She was going to take off when Michiru grabbed  her arm and made her turn around.</p>
<p>&quot;Please, bring him back here  safe and sound. The both of you... safe and sound.&quot; Those words were  full of worry like the blue eyes locked to her teal ones.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll do my best.&quot; Haruka replied winking and disentangled gently from Michiru's grasp.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
After  the three extempore hunters had left the group returned to their  activities. Lita, Serena, Ami, Rei and Mina had decided to make a group  trip to collect woods for the night fire. They walked at the edge of  the woods at first in silence, then, with Serena's contagious  enthusiasm they began chatting like a bunch of girls are supposed to do.
<p>Suddenly Lita snapped out of the cheerful conversation with a blunt statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know you all think I'm kind of a freak!&quot; She said that without accusing  tone, it was like a resigned declaration. Like she was saying 'I knew  it!'.</p>
<p>&quot;Why do you say that, Lita?&quot; Serena asked confused and saddened.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause just a freak have an entire set of knives in her luggage.&quot; She stated.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, actually it's quite... unusual.&quot; Rei said calmly but somehow disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&quot;But  who can decide what is freaky and what not? After all I've been hardly  in Central Park a couple of times in my entire life and now I'm camping  on a deserted island. And for a 'New Yorker' that's absolutely freaky!&quot;  Mina commented positively.</p>
<p>Serena nodded and added with her usual  - and already known by her companions – naiveté. &quot;Well, it's not like  carrying a gun, is it?&quot; The shocked look Lita gave her was soon matched  by the others.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I think those are Lita-san's tools of  trade.&quot; Ami said shyly. Everyone turned to look at her and she blushed  furiously.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that's right, Ami. The truth is that I'm a cook,  I'm training to become a chef.&quot; Lita admitted, hoping to dissipate  their suspicion, especially Rei's who seemed to be the most doubtful  one.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? Then you can teach Serena a couple of things. She  can't even thaw a pizza with a microwave properly.&quot; Mina joked and  immediately received a well assessed kick by her pigtailed friend. They  all burst out in laugh and went on their business until Lita lifted her  head and exclaimed something that got their attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Bananas!&quot;</p>
<p>They all glanced where she was looking and saw the green fruits dangling on the tree in front of the brunette.</p>
<p>After  a while with Taiki's and Furuhata's help they managed to collect a  sufficient amount of bananas to provide a scanty meal for all the group.</p>
<p>During  the journey back to the beach they talked like they were old friends.  Mina being the most talented for public relations was questioning them  properly with the clear intent of collecting the most juicy gossips.  She asked about boy-friends mostly and in order to make her friends to  open up she told about her adventurous love-affairs – a good amount  were just made up stories but Serena was the only one to know it.</p>
<p>When  Lita's turn came she darkened a little but nonetheless she answered  their questions. She even admitted Furuhata reminded her incredibly of  one of her ex-boyfriends. She told them how her stories always used to  end up bad, with her crying and him leaving. Her tales were honest and  she never sounded pathetic, they could see rather a hint of  resignation. She seemed a generous and not particularly demanding girl.  Yes she was energetic and quite blunt but it sounded odd she couldn't  have a serene relationship.</p>
<p>Lita's speech was long and was often  interrupted by peals of laughter at ridiculous situations or some joke  and it lasted until they were back at the beach.</p>
<p>Lita felt  relieved to be able to socialize with these girls and it hadn't been a  problem to reveal such personal information even if she had overlooked  a particularly recent affair.</p>

<em>&quot;You'll  come, won't you?&quot; She looked him straight in his brown eyes. The white  sheets around her and her hair loose on the pillow, she sure made a  quite beautiful picture. Of course she didn't consider herself a real  beauty, she was tall and strong built, and she often scared boys  instead of charming them, but she was cute and an extremely caring  person. And now with her naked shoulder coming out of the sheets in an  early Tokyo morning and a contented smile that reached her green eyes  she was surely a beautiful view...</em>
<p><em>But nonetheless he wasn't looking at her. He </em>couldn't <em>look  at her. He turned his back and put his clothes on. She knew he was in a  hurry cause he had to be at the restaurant in half an hour but in the  back of her mind she knew that he hadn't the courage to look at her and  lie.</em></p>
<p><em>He wouldn't come. She was about to go back home  having finished her training in Japan and he was ready for a new  affair. It had been fun, she had been great, but... nothing more.</em></p>
<p><em>It  wasn't like she couldn't make people like her, it was that she always  liked them much more than they liked her. She always gave her heart  totally to persons who weren't worth it. Sure that was a quite  masochistic behavior, but the fact was that she knew just that one. She  had never been able to 'love' half-way, never. Not even when she had  lived there... in that place where people were too hurt, too young and  disappointed to willingly open up and give themselves to another human  being.</em></p>
<p><em>He was fully clothed now and he had to look at her  to say good-bye. She noticed it was hard for him to look at her openly,  she smiled. It didn't matter how much that kind of things hurt her, she  couldn't just blame them. She was always indulgent.</em></p>
<p><em>She  had a big, caring, loving heart. And most of all, she had a big guilt  complex. In the back of her heart she always thought it was her fault  for them to not love her enough.</em></p>
<p><em>He smiled at her  nervously, then he leaned down to kiss her briefly on the lips. Then he  picked up his work-bag and leaving the small apartment waved at her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I hope I'll be able to show up, but don't count on it. Bye.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Lita  remained there, between the warm sheets of that small bed. She sighed,  then stood up shivering cause of her nudity and the cool morning air.</em></p>
<p><em>'Ok  Lita. Just another bad partner-choice. It hasn't been the first and it  won't be the last. Just a new scar, it's not the end of the world.'  That was what she used to tell herself every time something like that  happened. Just another scar for her soul... like those that were on the  pale skin of her back. Just another one... one little scar to add to  the others... so many others.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>She shrugged dismissing those thoughts. After all, what was one in comparison with a myriad.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>&quot;I  remember her addressing to you as 'Setsuna-mama' since the beginning...  Has she asked you like she did with us?&quot; Michiru was walking on the  shore with Setsuna by her side. They were a dozen of meters behind  Hotaru who was intent in collecting sea-shells. They had thought it was  better for her to try and play to keep her mind off her father's recent  death, so they had convinced her to do something new, hoping she could  get rid of some of her sadness.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, no. She just did and I never  objected. I didn't have the honor of the proposal.&quot; She said smiling.  It was a sincere smile but it was also a little sad, but Michiru  couldn't understand exactly why. She had found the older woman's  company genial, she felt they had a lot more in common with her than  with the others, with the exception of her three colleagues. Or maybe  even more than with them.</p>
<p>It was a strange feeling... That  getting close to completely strangers so quickly and deeply... That  strange feeling like she was somehow bound to Hotaru and to this  mysterious and quite weird woman. And not to mention Haruka.</p>
<p>The  mere thought of her was something always confusing she was finding not  so easy to understand the blonde. Usually Michiru was a good observer  and she knew human nature enough, plus she had an innate ability to  'sense' things. About Haruka she had been able to guess she was  complicated and full of contradictions. Haruka was outstanding and  reserved, so caring one moment and icy cold a moment later. Incredibly  brave when it was time for dangerous actions and incredibly  uncomfortable if not scared about feelings and emotions. She was  self-confident but sometimes Michiru had been able to see real fear in  her eyes...</p>
<p>&quot;You're not with me anymore, Michiru-san.&quot; The warm voice reached Michiru and tore her from her reverie.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen ne, Setsuna-san. I was just thinking.&quot; The aqua-haired girl smiled apologetically.</p>
<p>&quot;Are  you worried about Seiya-san?&quot; That question should have sound pretty  obvious, but Michiru was struck by it like she had just hit by a slap.  She hadn't thought about Seiya, he wasn't in her thoughts how he should  be. Michiru felt guilty about it, she cared for him, greatly, but  lately... Maybe he had been right, to think – no, to fear – she wasn't  attached to him how much she used to be.</p>
<p>&quot;Ehm... yes, yes he  could be in danger...&quot; Her answer was totally unconvincing but before  the older woman could stress the topic she walked off to her right and  picked up a sheet of paper half buried under the sand. &quot;What is this?&quot;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;So? Do you think it's true?&quot;
<p>Darien  observed the proffered sheet of paper intently, sure longer than it was  necessary to read the name under the two pictures.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't <em>think</em> it's true... I <em>know</em> it is.&quot; Darien then said looking Michiru straight in the eyes. The  aqua-haired woman was confused and worried about that declaration. &quot;So  it was him... mmh... I can't say I'm surprised.&quot; He continued and when  he lifted his head up he saw confusion on Michiru's face and realized  the violinist didn't know anything. &quot;I thought Haruka had told you.&quot; He  said quite incredulous himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! You mean Haruka knew?&quot;</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;It's a lot of bananas...&quot; Lita was looking at the fruits pensive.
<p>&quot;What ya doing Lita?&quot; Serena said from behind her. &quot;Oh, too bad I don't like bananas too much...&quot; the pigtailed girl said.</p>
<p>&quot;Well I don't think you have much of a choice, Serena.&quot; The brunette was still pensive.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know... well it's not like I don't like it... I love banana split, for  example!&quot; She smiled broadly thinking about it. Her light blue-eyes  were dreaming and her mouth slightly open. Lita looked at her and  sweatdropped.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my... Serena is thinking about ice-cream!&quot; Mina  exclaimed walking to them. &quot;I can tell by the drool.&quot; She winked at  Lita then elbowed her best-friend who snapped out of her dreamy state  and blinked confused.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you said something, Mina?&quot; At that the other two burst out in laughter.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course!&quot; Lita suddenly exclaimed. The two blondes looked at her  questioning and she explained herself. She wanted to do something to  make that big amount of bananas a little more succulent.</p>
<p>&quot;But how?&quot; They asked in unison.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  sure I saw something during the luggage-raid. I didn't collected it  cause it has no nutrients, but it sure tastes.&quot; The cook said.</p>
<p>They  decided to ask everyone had made the luggage-searching for information.  Nobody had seen anything eatable and the last one to ask was Jade.</p>
<p>Lita  approached him while he was laid under a tree reading a book. He had  made a sort of pallet with some towels and had a suitcase opened beside  him, it was full of various items that seemed to be collected from  mixed luggage. She took a rapid glance at that and soon recognized what  she was looking for.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that your suitcase?&quot; She said abruptly gesturing the suitcase with her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, <em>now</em> it is mine.&quot; He answered looking at her over the sunglasses he wore.</p>
<p>&quot;I need that.&quot; She said and leaned down to pick up the small bottle.</p>
<p>BLAM!</p>
<p>With a very quick move he closed the suitcase risking to hurt her fingers.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you insane!&quot; She yelled massaging her her hand.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you doing?&quot; He asked calm.</p>
<p>&quot;I need that to arrange a meal for all of us.&quot; She was still fuming but she managed to keep her voice low.</p>
<p>&quot;And tell me why I should give you that?&quot; He asked smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause  it's for the community and cause you don't need it anyway.&quot; She had  realized he didn't want to give up and was getting annoyed by his  behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;What will I have in return?&quot; He asked now standing up,  &quot;There's nothing for free here.&quot; He now was looking at her challenging.  She wasn't afraid by his glare but she had realized what sort of a man  he was and she didn't like the idea of dealing with him.</p>
<p>&quot;I won't pay you for something that doesn't belong to you, that's for sure.&quot; She said looking him straight in the eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Then you won't have it... that's for sure.&quot; He repeated sarcastic, then he returned to his pallet and his book.</p>
<p>Lita remained there looking at him for a minute, then she walked away without any more talk.</p>
<p>When  she returned to the others she was very upset. The others were sitting  in a circle near the spot where she had her knives and when they had  stored the bananas. She sat down with them and they continued talking  while having a banana each. In a half an hour she had forgotten her  disagreement with the long-haired man and was again talking serenely  with Ami.</p>
<p>&quot;Then a colleague of his phoned me to tell me a  message, if I would have been able to delay my leaving he could have  been at the airport.&quot; She had finally decided to talk about her recent  affair and the way she had let him fool her. She had told Ami who  seemed to be the more understanding and less judgmental. She liked her  and felt like they could be in tune, the kindness and seriousness of  the blue-haired girl were reassuring and felt like she could trust her.</p>
<p>&quot;So you weren't supposed to be on this flight?&quot; The doctor's daughter asked curious.</p>
<p>&quot;No,  I booked the previous flight early in the morning but I decided to give  it a try and I found a ticket for this flight... so we could say it's  his fault if I am here.&quot; She had said that joking and there wasn't  resentment in her statement.</p>
<p>Ami was pensive then she made a  small smile, &quot;My mom and I shouldn't be here either. She was called for  an emergency at the last minute but when she arrived at the hospital  there wasn't any emergency, so we changed our reservations. It's an odd  coincidence, don't you think?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah... what the Hell you think you're doing?&quot; Lita stood up abruptly and glared towards the pile of bananas with flaming eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm picking up a banana.&quot; Jade's voice didn't show any sign of intimidation despite her tone.</p>
<p>&quot;You won't.&quot; Now she was openly threatening him. The atmosphere grew icy cold, no one dared to speak or make any sound.</p>
<p>&quot;Listen  to me little girl, you're not the one to give permissions here. No one  is. So don't bother glaring at me like that. I'm not scared and you're  not convincing.&quot; With that he turned his attention at the pile of  fruits again.</p>
<p>&quot;I think she's more than convincing. Look at her look it gives me the creeps.&quot; Serena whispered to Mina.</p>
<p>&quot;If  you want the banana you know what I want in exchange.&quot; She said firmly.  Then she walked where she had her belongings. The long haired man  smiled and chose one of the green fruits and grabbed it.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe  the next time, little girl.&quot; He said smirking. Then they heard a hiss  and a ZAC. &quot;Oh shit!&quot; He exclaimed in surprise and jumped back looking  at her wide-eyed. Then he looked down at the spot his hands had been a  couple of seconds before and at the big knife that was sticking out of  a poor banana.</p>
<p>All the girls that were there gasped and Serena  gave a small cry then she put her hand on her mouth. Lita stood there  glaring at the long-haired man with almost scary intensity.</p>
<p>Serena's  cry had brought a worried Darien followed by Michiru and Setsuna where  the commotion was. And when they arrived they didn't notice the knife  at first, just the menacing and confident tone of the tall brunette.</p>
<p>&quot;Do  you think I'm scared by you? I know guys like you and I know that you  understand just this kind of language made of knives and menaces. Now,  if you want one of those,&quot; she continued pointing at the fruits, &quot;you  know what you have to do. If not you can go back under the stone you  crawled out of.&quot; She hissed the last part.</p>
<p>Jade looked at her for a long minute then he turned and left with empty hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Someone want one?&quot; Lita then asked cheerfully picking up one of the fruit while she retrieved her blade.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Hey  you! Leave her alone!&quot; Lita ran to the secluded corner of the big  courtyard where had been the commotion. When she arrived the three boys  who seemed to be not more than twelve turned to her and glared at her.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Why  you guys don't try to deal with someone more your like you? She's just  a kid.&quot; She said pointing to the little girl who was crouched on the  ground behind them. She had tore clothes and was crying.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Mind your own business freak!&quot; One of the boys spat at her but when he turned his back to he had made a crucial mistake.</em></p>
<p><em>Lita  grabbed him by his shoulder and throw him away, then she tuned to one  of the other two and punched him in the stomach. The third withdrew  slowly scared but then he saw a flash of light behind her and smirked.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  think it's better for you if you go away and don't cross our path ever  again.&quot; He said confidently. Lita smiled, he didn't seem much of a  challenge for her. He was small and weak and his movement weren't too  swift.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh... It's that a threat? Are you menacing me?&quot; She asked mockingly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It's  a good advice. Don't tell me I didn't warn you, then!&quot; He said and  looked over her shoulder. She got the hint and turned around to see the  first - who seemed to be the boss of the gang – standing with an  annoying smirk on his face. She walked close to him to face him, but  when she was a couple of feet from him the girl on the ground shout.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;NO!  Stay away! He has a knife!&quot; But unluckily her words came too late, he  had launched himself to Lita brandishing the small knife, before the  tall brunette could duck the blade had penetrate in her left upper arm  and a piercing pain ran through her entire frame. She slumped to the  ground while the three ran away, but before they were off the boss  turned and pointed at her winking.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;We're not done with  you!&quot; Was the last threat then he was gone before someone could warn  the personnel who worked at the County Institute for children.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>Lita  sat there, looking at the crimson stain enlarging on her sleeve, it  wasn't the first time and it wouldn't be the last. Since when she was  just a kid and they put her in the orphanage after her parents' death  she had to deal with such things. She knew them and she knew how to  deal with them.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>&quot;Hush.  Here she is...&quot; The short bald man stopped and whispered pointing at a  wart-hog just in front of them. He bent behind a bush and gestured them  to do the same. &quot;Are you ready?&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka and Seiya nodded.</p>
<p>They  had studied a plan, more exactly Rei's grandfather knew a technique to  hunt wart-hogs. Haruka and Seiya had to be the baits running in  opposite directions to confound the animal and then the older man had  to kill it with one of Lita's knives. Told like that it seemed easy but  the real thing was that the two youngsters weren't expert and the small  elder didn't look like completely trustworthy with his strange behavior  and his passion for pretty girls.</p>
<p>But they were there now and it  was worthy give it a try. That was what Haruka thought even if when she  looked at the animal's tusks she gulped. Seiya was looking at her and  noticed the not so tranquil expression.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you scared, Tenoh?&quot;  He said with a mocking smile. &quot;No more the brave knight without pretty  girls in the neighborhood to show off to, are you?&quot;</p>
<p>Before Haruka  could reply Rei's grandfather gestured them to take their positions. So  she just glared at him and walked to the left while he walked to the  right winking at her. When they were in place they stood to get the  animal's attention. The mother wart-hog lifted its head swiftly and  looked around at first at Haruka then at Seiya. At that they began  running in opposite directions meanwhile the old man was approaching  the animal from behind.</p>
<p>Unluckily for Seiya he was too much  slower than Haruka so the smart animal decided to chase him, dismissing  the too fast racer. It charged the young man grunting with fury and  when he realized that cried out running even faster. At his cries  Haruka and the Shinto priest went after it trying to reach it and take  the wart-hog's attention off the poor pop-star. Propitiously Seiya  decided to run in a circle and so Haruka was able to quickly reach him,  when she could she grabbed his arm and pulled him out of the furious  animal's path. They fell and one of the hog's tusk cut in the boy's  leg. He cried in pain and fear but the old man arrived and managed to  scare the hog away.</p>
<p>&quot;Fortunately it just grazed you. If you'd  been given the whole blow... I don't want to think about that.&quot; The  elder mumbled checking on Seiya's leg.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, old man. It hurts anyway.&quot; He said scolding.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, come on, don't be such a cry-baby.&quot; Haruka scoffed at him with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmph!&quot; He just huffed, glaring.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think it's better for him to go to the doctor.&quot; Grandpa said wisely. He  and Haruka helped Seiya standing. When he was on his feet again Haruka  remembered suddenly that they had another task to accomplish. She then  took out of her rucksack Furuhata's antenna and climbed up a solid tree  and secured the item to a branch with a leather belt.</p>
<p>Then they  decided Haruka would have walked the injured Seiya back at the beach  and the old man would have chased the hog down trying at least to  locate its lair.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Someone want one?&quot;
<p>No  one could reply for a minute. The girls were all quite shocked while  Darien, Michiru and Setsuna slightly amused once they had made out the  situation. It was a good thing Jade didn't feel like he could do  whatever he wanted to, but then they didn't know if it was such a good  thing that someone was <em>skillful</em> enough to stand up to him. After all they knew nothing about each other.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow!&quot;  Serena's comment was the first sound after Lita's offer. &quot;Where did you  learn to do that?&quot; The pigtailed spontaneity was something they were  just starting to get accustomed to.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, it's a long story.&quot; Lita  tried to dismiss the subject but Mina was curious and patted the spot  beside her for the brunette to take a seat.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it's not like we lack free time.&quot;</p>
<p>Rei  sat aside glancing at Lita suspiciously and not too friendly while Ami  remained calm not wanting to show any kind of emotion.</p>
<p>When they  realized the commotion was over Michiru and Setsuna left the group  returning back to Hotaru who was sit under a tree chomping on a banana  with Taiki and Yaten while Darien joined the girls.</p>
<p>During the  short trip Setsuna noticed Michiru had fallen in a very dark mood but  when they reached the others her usual kind and calm demeanor was back.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Seiya  and Haruka walked slowly along the unclear path. It was a rather  difficult walk cause of the fact that they tried to minimize the  strains for the man's injured leg. They had tied a stripe of cotton  torn out from his shirt right above the rather deep cut to function  like a tourniquet, then they had kept their way to the beach. The first  minutes of their walk he had made little use of Haruka's frame for a  support and she had reminded him just once, after all it was him the  one feeling pain. But after a while he had started to lean against her  more and more and now they were both panting by exertion.
<p>&quot;I think a  little break is in order.&quot; The blonde's tone wasn't one to be open to  any debate so they stopped and sat down one in front of the other using  two big stones like chairs.</p>
<p>Even if he would never admit it,  Seiya was very grateful for the little rest, his injured leg hurt and  his good one was sore for the extra exploitation. He sat down closing  his eyes for a moment. When he re-opened them he looked at the tall  woman in front of him. He didn't like her but he didn't know why  exactly. Yes, she was too kind and too friendly to Michiru and the  violinist seemed appreciate that a lot, and that alone could be enough  to not liking Haruka, but it was something else. He felt like they were  in some kind of competition... for everything, not just for Michiru's  attention, after all Michiru was straight, wasn't she?</p>
<p>Haruka  hadn't liked to be the first to give up and ask for a break, so she had  said that as an order to the black-haired man. She was exhausted cause  after the first fifteen minutes he had leant against her heavily and he  was a tall – almost as tall as her - and well built man of about 70  kilograms and she wasn't exactly at the top of her form. She hadn't get  any sleep the past two nights and her body was painfully reminding her  that fact. Her shoulder was better but still hurt, especially with the  major exertion she was putting it in. She glanced at her companion, he  was sitting with his eyes closed and seemed to enjoy greatly their  rest. She looked at him intently, he was handsome – if you're one to  like those kind of things – and he was charming – if you like arrogant  and confident persons. She didn't like any of that so she didn't like  him. But then again she liked Michiru... a lot, and Michiru seemed to  care a lot for him, plus Michiru was a perceptive and intelligent woman  who seemed to understand people well, so she skeptically concluded  Seiya should had to have something good in him. Then a little vicious  voice spoke inside her head annoyingly.</p>
<p>'It's not like you're envious, is it?' The mocking tone was evident.</p>
<p>'Why the Hell should I be envious about that baka?' She replied to herself.</p>
<p>'No  reason, you're right. After all he'll just probably end up dating her,  and you don't care about that, do you?' That inner voice was something  really pissing.</p>
<p>'Oh shut up! I don't care, you know how it is...  Rule number one: do not date straight girls, they're just trouble.' She  replied firmly to her own conscience.</p>
<p>'Yes, sure... rule number  one, how can I forget about that!' The sarcasm was enough for the  already worn car-racer and she shook violently her head to dismiss that  quite surreal if not totally insane conversation. She then concentrated  to her body and began massaging her sore shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Weren't you injured?&quot; The loud question broke the silence. Haruka lifted her head to look at her interlocutor before answering.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  nothing.&quot; The reply was curtly and spoken in an unfriendly tone. Seiya  decided he had tried enough to be polite and just shrugged. Doing it he  send waves to his leg and soon winced in pain. Haruka noticed that and  stood walking to him, then she kneeled down in front of him to get a  close look to his leg.</p>
<p>&quot;Let me get a look.&quot; She touched the  injured limb extremely gently and he was quite surprised about that. He  hadn't expected her to be gentle, but now that she was very close and  intent to look at his leg, unaware of him watching her he could clearly  see that she was a woman. Her hands and touch were delicate and despite  she had an athletic, muscular body she had also everything she was  supposed to have. This didn't mean he liked her, she really wasn't his  type but he could look at her in a different way.</p>
<p>&quot;Why the Hell are you staring at me, baka?&quot; Her not so gentle voice tore him out of his thoughts.</p>
<p>&quot;I wasn't thinking about you, moron!&quot; He said but his blushing was betraying him.</p>
<p>&quot;It's  better for you if it is the truth.&quot; She mumbled then she took his leg  and place it on her lifted knee. &quot;I want to change the bandages,  they're already soaked.&quot; She informed him and proceeded to uncover the  gush and tore another piece of his expansive shirt.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey!&quot; He protested but she ignored him, doing her task with enough skill to not hurt him.</p>
<p>Seiya  had protested just out of habit it wasn't like he cared about the  shirt, then he considered the fact that all the care the blonde – who  obviously disliked him a lot – was giving him will be given him - in  even greater amount – by Michiru. He already pictured her concerned  about his health, tending to his wound with gentleness and staying with  him all the time. After all he had seen her looking after the  black-haired child or even – and annoyingly – the blonde. Those  thoughts brought a large smile on his features and Haruka couldn't  ignore it.</p>
<p>&quot;What are smiling at, idiot?&quot; She couldn't help but be rude to him.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing of your concern.&quot; He said, but the smile never left his face.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think we'd better going, we have still a good amount of walk to do.&quot;  She said and helped him to stand offering her right hand. He took it  gently noticing for the first time the dirty clothe around it.</p>
<p>&quot;What  have you done to it?&quot; He asked her when he had already circled her  shoulders with his arm and they were already proceeding down the  unclear path.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She said confused. Seiya indicated her hand with his look, she followed his eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  that. Nothing, just some trouble with a tree.&quot; She said, her eyes  looking in the distance at her memory of the previous day.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmh...  you hurt yourself chopping wood, huh?&quot; That was just to do some  conversation. His mood had suddenly improved thinking about Michiru's  attentions waiting for him ahead at the beach.</p>
<p>&quot;Chopping wood,  yes.&quot; Haruka answered a little unsure, her mind dangerously falling  again towards the disturbing happenings of the previous day and night.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;And  so, that's it.&quot; Lita concluded her story with a shrug. She had told her  new friends how she had to learn how to deal with bossy people, about  her stay in several orphanages before she could use properly her  parents' life annuity and finally got to live by on her own. She also  told how she had had trouble at school cause of her disliking of  injustices and how one day someone had shown her how a knife could be  used for something different than to hurt people. But this last one she  had told just Ami. That was something personal, almost intimate for her  and Mina's superficial and gossip-inclined curiosity or Darien's  patronizing gaze, Serena easily shocked naiveté and - most of all -  Rei's judgmental silence weren't something she could bear about those  things. So now she was sat beside Ami while the others were engrossed  in a totally different conversation.
<p>&quot;At school people always feared  me, like I was some sort of violent freak, I could never understand  that, I can't see myself like someone scary.&quot; She had spoken with her  peculiar spontaneity and sincerity and for her gladness the look in  Ami's blue eyes was one of equal honesty.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it's that... the  reason why you always give more than you receive in relationships.&quot; Ami  blushed in the exact moment she said that thinking about the intimacy  of her consideration.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Lita didn't seem to bother, on the contrary she looked like she was truly interested in Ami's opinion.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  you are extremely dedicate to another person... maybe because you want  he/her to be assured you're not a bad person.&quot; Ami concluded looking  her in the eyes. She was usually shy, but she knew Lita wouldn't have  considered her interest like intrusion. Lita was a very clear and  honest girl, if something bothered her she would have pointed that out  with no problem at all.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe you're right, maybe it's that... I think I shouldn't act like that, though.&quot; Lita considered pensive.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think you shouldn't, too. I think there's no need to be like that  anymore. After all we hadn't notice your past, we noticed just your  goodness at first.&quot; Ami said with a gentle smile, the tall brunette  smiled back truly happy for her words, then she darkened a little  looking in front of her, where the others were sitting and among them  Rei.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah... But not everyone thinks like you do...&quot; Ami followed Lita's look and immediately realized what she intended.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe someone needs a little longer to understand.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe...&quot;</p>

It was first hours past noon when two exhausted Haruka and Seiya made it eventually to the beach and then to the doctor.
<p>The  blue haired woman attended the pop-singer's wound with alcohol and  clean bandages with Michiru's and Ami's help. The violinist was very  concerned about her friend's conditions but she calmed down when the  doctor reassured them it was nothing serious, sure it hurt but it would  be ok in a couple of days.</p>
<p>For all the time they tended to him  Haruka had waited in the back corner of the tent to be sure it was  nothing serious, when they had done she excused herself and exited to  search for Hotaru.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. She had sensed it. And  most of all she had noticed. She had noticed the cold gaze Michiru had  given her and only her. The aqua-haired girl hadn't even acknowledged  her, she hadn't spoken to her nor she had asked about their hunt,  nothing. Ok, she was worried about the moron, but it wasn't just that.</p>
<p>While  walking on the sand Haruka thought about the strange feeling she felt.  It was something really upsetting. Every time she thought Michiru could  be mad at her her heart skipped a beat. This was disturbing in a way  she didn't like a single bit. Fortunately she was spotted by Hotaru who  was immediately in her arms asking and hugging.</p>
<p>That little girl  was capable to make Haruka forget almost anything... yes, cause a  little bit of turmoil about Michiru still remained in Haruka's mind  even if she was engrossed in looking after the young kid.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  forest was strangely silent. No noises for at least five minutes, now.  Even his prey had stopped its grouting. Birds turned quiet and were no  more rustles of crawling creatures on the ground. Just the wind was  blowing through the upper branches but its whistle was so soft that he  could barely perceive it.
<p>The dark furred animal had its head high  and its small ears were stretched to hear any smallest sound. He  stopped behind a bush, he had wasted almost two hours trying to track  the stubborn animal and he didn't want to let it go, but he knew  something about forests and animal and he knew that silence was never a  good sign. So when the sound of rustling getting close at a very fast  pace came from right in front of him he wasn't surprised. Nonetheless  his heart kept beating fast and hard. He was scared.</p>
<p>The wart-hog  had the natural instinct of running away to save its own life for its  and her cubs' sake but the predator was faster and in a blur of dark  brown fur and groaning and grunting, and desperate cries for life the  wart-hog existence ceased. Its carcass flew in the air and fell down  with a dull thud right beside his feet. Then the groan got closer and  closer as beads of sweat ran down his spine and the hand that clutched  the big knife trembled. Maybe if he could stay unmoving he could be as  invisible.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>

The  afternoon was drawing to a close and with the unexpected meal provided  by the bananas the nervousness was subsiding at the beach. Almost for  everyone.
<p>Haruka was quite concerned about the old Shinto priest even  if she knew that it was still early to actually be worried. On top of  that Michiru was extremely cold even when Hotaru was with them. An  inner conflict was taking place in the blonde's mind cause she was  arguing with herself about the eventuality of going to Michiru to  apologize about what had happened to Seiya.</p>
<p>'It's not your fault!' Her inner voice pointed out.</p>
<p>'I  know, but she had recommended me to not let him being hurt.' Even her  wasn't convinced about that but she couldn't think about any other  reason for the violinist to be mad at her.</p>
<p>'Ok. Then go and make  a fool of yourself. It's not like I already know you are one.' She  sweatdropped, she was being scolded by her own mind that was also  making sarcasm.</p>
<p>&quot;I do need to get some sleep.&quot; She murmured that  aloud and Setsuna, who was going through Souchi's papers lifted her  head and glanced up at her with an inquisitive look.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot; She said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing.  I was thinking out loud.&quot; Then she sighed and the older woman frowned  at her. &quot;You know what's going on, don't you? You know everything all  the time.&quot; Haruka's statement was bitter and she was obviously loosing  her temper.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking ab-...?&quot; Before Setsuna could ask her Haruka turned her back to her and walked away.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevermind.&quot; She said waving her hand in dismissal of her own question.</p>
<p>Michiru  too wasn't placid even if the doctor had said Seiya had just a deep  scratched that had bled a lot but wasn't nothing serious. She was  upset. No, she was pissed. Really pissed. And disappointed. And  frustrated. She was scared and tired since they had survived the  crash-down and now she was mad.</p>
<p>Her rage was focused and with a  very specific reason. She was mad at her. She had felt betrayed, she  felt like she was a fool. And that was why she was even more mad at  herself. She had let a perfect stranger fooling her. Her. Kaioh Michiru  who was always aware of herself, the others and the situation.</p>
<p>She  didn't know if it was frustration, tiredness or fear to bring tears at  the corner of her eyes but she knew that she had to blink them away  with Seiya great surprise. He was about to inquire her about that when  she excused herself and walked away to try and calm herself.</p>
<p>She  walked along the shore for a couple of minutes taking deep breaths. She  had just recomposed herself that she looked up and saw someone she did  not want to see right then.</p>
<p>Haruka noticed the big turmoil in  Michiru's ocean blue eyes and scolded herself again to be who had  caused that even if she didn't know how. The violinist soon stiffened  her shoulders and presented the racer with a very cold demeanor.</p>
<p>&quot;What  do you want Haruka-san?&quot; Her words were like slicing blades for the  very tired and frustrated Haruka. Why? Why was she mad?</p>
<p>&quot;I... I'm  sorry.&quot; 'Oh my God, you did it! You apologized. You never apologize  even if you're wrong!' Haruka's inner voice had resurfaced. 'The great  Tenoh Haruka...'</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, great! You're sorry! I thought we were...  friends...&quot; Michiru's reply was... hurt? Haruka's mood fell even lower.  She felt sick at the thought she had hurt the aqua-haired beauty.</p>
<p>&quot;I  know you care about him. And I'm sorry.&quot; 'Now you're making a fool of  yourself, look at you! You even saved his life and you are the one  apologizing!' Haruka didn't listened to her annoyingly right inner  voice and looked at Michiru almost timidly, she was feeling like she  was a little girl in front of a sever parent and that was completely  out of character for her. &quot;And... and we are friends!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no...  No no no, you lied to me! I trusted you and you lied to me!&quot; Michiru  couldn't keep her cold demeanor any more. The pressure was too much for  her too and she acted out of character too.</p>
<p>&quot;What are you talking  about!&quot; Haruka had realized Seiya wasn't the reason for Michiru's  actions and now was confused and really, really upset about her own  behavior.</p>
<p>&quot;I found a interesting sheet of paper, this morning.  With two nice pictures of that Jade-guy.&quot; Her look was accusing but  Haruka was dumbfounded, she didn't know what she was talking about.  &quot;You know, two cute pictures one took full face and one in profile. But  you know... I think that wasn't his good profile cause he seemed quite  ragged like he was just... arrested!&quot; Now Michiru was yelling. They  were fortunately far enough from the others, but close enough to  Setsuna and Hotaru for the tanned woman to lift her head from the paper  she was reading and glance towards them with a worried look on her face.</p>
<p>&quot;What...?  You mean... Jade's the jailbird?&quot; Haruka then realized she hadn't  talked with her about Darien's and her discover. She hadn't wanted to  spread panic and then it happened what it happened: the journey to the  cockpit, the strange interceptions and then Hotaru's father. She had  completely forgot about the dead marshal and his hypothetic captive.</p>
<p>Now  as she looked at the enraged woman in front of her she knew that every  thing she could have said to justify her behavior couldn't be accepted  by Michiru, the violinist was too upset at the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't  trust me.&quot; That was a bitter statement, &quot;You have never trusted me. I  even asked you once and you didn't answer me. It was all part of the  charming-plan, wasn't it? You talk to me and make me think I can get  close to you, you even made me catch you in a couple of  'weakness-moments' so I could be fooled...&quot; In the exact moment she had  said those things Michiru knew those were cruel words, she knew deep  inside of her that the blonde had hated her own self for letting  someone see her in such moments, she could imagine how hard it had been  for her. And as she was telling the car-racer those things she could  clearly see the hurt in her teal eyes. But Michiru was mad, she was  really upset and she had intended to be cruel, to hurt the blonde. She  wanted to make Haruka feel like she was feeling: betrayed.</p>
<p>Haruka  was shocked. Everything she had done during those two days had been  weird for her and pretty scary. She wasn't used to get close to people,  she wasn't used to care. And most of all she wasn't used to let people  get close to her. She had went against her own rules and principles  drawn by the charm of that beautiful woman and now...</p>
<p>&quot;I didn't  know I was under some kind of obligation to you.&quot; Haruka's voice was so  cold that Michiru had to suppress a shiver. The blonde turned and  walked away at a fast pace leaving a trembling and confused Michiru  behind. The fact was that the young musician was painfully aware of  Haruka's sudden absence but she could hardly remember the reason of  their discussion or why she had been so harsh to the blonde.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
After a couple of hours the sun was setting and Rei's grandfather returned to the camp dragging the heavy carcass of a wart-hog.
<p>Haruka  couldn't help but smile at the view of the short man returning  successful with his prey, despite the incredibly dark mood she was in.  She made her way to the main of the group to be sure he was ok, then  she returned to a secluded spot not wanting to meet Michiru or an  inquisitive Hotaru.</p>
<p>Michiru was in an equally bad mood and was  hardly trying to keep a nonchalant facade despite Seiya's sloppiness  and Hotaru question about Haruka's whereabouts.</p>
<p>The rest of the  group greeted the old man cheerfully, he had come back with a quite big  wart-hog that could provide meat for several days. Lita was immediately  in charge of the settling of a real meal for everyone. She had Ami, Rei  and Mina to help her and Serena to be in the way, but they were so  excited about having something that could prevent them to starve to  death that even the clumsy Serena was just a reason for laughing during  the cooking.</p>
<p>After the dinner they sat all – with the exception of Haruka - in a circle around the fire and were chatting cheerfully.</p>
<p>Hotaru  suddenly looked up right in Setsuna garnet eyes and talked to her with  great seriousness, &quot;I'm worried. Where is Haruka-papa? She hasn't even  eat?&quot;</p>
<p>Setsuna smiled at one of those moment when the little child  seemed to be much older and wiser than she really was. &quot;You don't have  to worry, Hotaru-chan, she is a grown up and if she doesn't feel like  eating I'm sure she has her good reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But she have to be  hungry! I've never seen her eating... nor sleeping. Do you think she  could be sleeping right now?&quot; The purple eyes sparkled with hope.</p>
<p>&quot;Well... Maybe... maybe.&quot; Setsuna's skeptical tone didn't fool Hotaru who had her little brows furrowed in a very cute frown.</p>
<p>&quot;They're  not supposed to argue, aren't they?&quot; Another extremely sharp  observation by the black-haired kid. And another knowing and sweet  smile by the tanned woman. She looked towards Michiru who was sat  beside Seiya and was pretending to have fun but the tense features and  the fact that no one smile ever reached her eyes betrayed her real  mood. The she turned towards the darkness enveloping the beach in the  general direction Haruka was supposed to be and sighed.</p>
<p>&quot;No, little one, they're not supposed to argue.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So  Grandpa! Tell us how you were able to kill that poor hog, like you were  some kind of Rambo and me and the snobby racer were just getting in the  way!&quot; Seiya inquired the old man cheerfully.</p>
<p>&quot;Well... It wasn't  just me you know...&quot; He turned crimson then he continued oddly  embarrassed after Rei had translated for the Americans, &quot;... I had a  help, you know...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A help? What was that... Santa Claus gave it to you?&quot; Yaten sarcasm was unnoticed by the most of them.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  I had this big knife! I couldn't have done it without it!&quot; He concluded  quickly as his face turned an even deeper shade of red.</p>
<p>End chapter 4.</p>

<strong>Author's note</strong>:  Ok, I'm not too satisfied about this chapter. Makoto is probably my  favorite of the Inners but I couldn't write everything I had in mind  for her. This has come out even longer that I had expected and I didn't  want it to look like a Makoto's story instead a Haruka&amp;Michiru one  but now this has came out all... different from my idea.</span>
