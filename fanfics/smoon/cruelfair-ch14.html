<h1>The Cruelty and Fairness of Fate (part 14 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/cruelfair-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>	Makoto held the small teddy bear on her lap and 
nervously straightened its purple bow one more time.  
Seated next to her on the bus seat was Ami.  The blue 
haired girl watched the other&#146;s actions with some 
amusement.
	&#147;Hotaru will like it, Mako-chan,&#148; said Ami.  
&#147;She&#146;ll like her birthday present as well.  You shouldn&#146;t 
be so concerned about it.&#148;
	&#147;I hope so,&#148; answered Makoto.  She tugged on the 
bear&#146;s ear.  &#147;I just hope this is enough of an apology 
for messing up her birthday dinner.&#148;
	Makoto thought back to Thursday night, when she had 
realized what she&#146;d done.  She and Ami had been sitting 
together trying to puzzle out the symbolism in the 
reading assignment Hideo-sensei had given her classes.  
At one end of the couch, Ami was going on about the hero 
and his shield.  At the other end, Makoto sat with her 
legs tangled comfortably around Ami&#146;s and listened as the 
girl spoke.  Makoto&#146;s eyes had drifted shut as she 
concentrated on the sound of Ami&#146;s voice, the actual 
words just flowing over her head.
	Feeling more playful than studious, Makoto tickled 
the inside of Ami&#146;s thigh with her toe.  A light slap and 
an admonishment to pay attention because this was going 
to be on the test were her answers.  Makoto had nodded 
and promised to pay attention as Ami went back to her 
analysis.  Her eyes closed again, however, and her 
thoughts had begun to wander.
	Makoto had been feeling pretty good the last few 
days.  She and Ami had talked a bit about things, but 
most of the time was spent just enjoying each other and 
being happy-in-love, which left a lot about their 
situation unsaid.  But all of this was new, and they 
couldn&#146;t be blamed for wanting to just enjoy it for a 
while before having to deal with bigger realities.  
Things like telling Ami&#146;s mom.  But that was Ami&#146;s thing, 
just like telling Mamoru was going to be Usagi&#146;s, and it 
was going to be Ami&#146;s decision how to handle it.
	Then there was Haruka&#146;s gang to tell.  Makoto 
wanted to do that herself, if for no other reason than to 
see the look on the Haruka&#146;s face when she told her she&#146;d 
finally gotten the girl.  Makoto thought Saturday would 
be a good time to do that, after Hotaru&#146;s birthday party.
	Remembering the party was what had triggered it.  
Her eyes had popped open, and she sat up as quickly as 
her tangled legs and expanding stomach would allow her.  
&#147;Hotaru&#146;s birthday,&#148; she&#146;d said to a questioning Ami as 
she moved.  &#147;It was Monday.  I completely forgot.&#148;
	&#147;The party isn&#146;t until Saturday,&#148; Ami had answered, 
still confused about what a child&#146;s birthday had to do 
with ancient Celtic literature.  &#147;We&#146;ve already got her 
presents.&#148;
	&#147;No, no,&#148; said Makoto, &#147;this isn&#146;t about the party.  
It&#146;s about Monday.  Her birthday, when her parents no 
doubt had plans for her, and two of them wound up having 
to spend all of their free time with me at the hospital.  
Haruka didn&#146;t even make it to the school to pick her up.&#148;  
Makoto shook her head in annoyance at herself.  &#147;I have 
to apologize.  Little kids don&#146;t forget when you mess up 
their birthdays.&#148;
	It had been too late that night to call Hotaru, 
though that hadn&#146;t stopped Makoto from calling the girl&#146;s 
parents.  Haruka had told her not to worry about it, that 
they all understood.  But Makoto still wanted to do 
something to make up for it.  So she&#146;d spent Friday 
evening dragging everyone around looking for something to 
help her say &#145;I&#146;m sorry.&#146;  The furry, tan bear she now 
held on her lap was the result of that.
	Makoto tucked the bear back inside his gift bag and 
rearranged the tissue paper over and around his ears just 
before the bus pulled to their stop.
	When they got to the house, Hotaru greeted them 
enthusiastically at the door.
	&#147;Happy birthday, Hotaru,&#148; said Ami as the little 
girl pulled them inside.
	&#147;Thank you,&#148; answered Hotaru.  &#147;You&#146;re the first 
ones here, and I&#146;ve got something really good to show you, 
too.&#148;
	Makoto smiled at the girl.  &#147;Can&#146;t wait to see it,&#148; 
she said.  &#147;But before you show us, I have something for 
you.  I know Monday was really your birthday, and that 
your parents wanted to spend it just with you.  I&#146;m sorry 
I took them away from you for so long that night.&#148;  
Makoto held out the brightly colored gift bag.  &#147;I hope 
this helps to make up for it a bit.&#148;
	Hotaru took the package that was being offered to 
her.  &#147;Thank you, Mako-chan, but you didn&#146;t have to.&#148;  
She shook the bag slightly, peering down into the tissue 
paper, then asked eagerly, &#147;Can I open it?&#148;
	Makoto nodded, and Hotaru knelt down and set the 
bag on the floor.  Her hands reached in and moved aside 
the tissue paper until she felt something soft and furry.  
Her smile widened as she pulled the bear from his 
wrappings.
	&#147;You&#146;re so cute,&#148; Hotaru cooed to the stuffed 
animal as she held him up in front of her.  &#147;I hope you 
didn&#146;t have to stay in there for too long.&#148;  Hotaru 
hugged the bear to her and stood, one arm reaching up to 
Makoto.
	The taller girl bent down to hug the child.  &#147;Do 
you like him?&#148; she asked.
	&#147;Very much,&#148; said Hotaru with a nod.  As they 
pulled back from the hug, she added, &#147;You don&#146;t have to 
worry about my birthday.  I know it was an accident.  And 
Michiru-mama still made my favorite dinner.  We just 
waited until everyone came home to eat.  We had cake and 
ice cream afterwards, too.  And I got my special 
present,&#148; she said excitedly.
	Hotaru hurried into the next room in search of a 
parent with Makoto and Ami following more sedately behind 
her.  &#147;Setsuna-mama,&#148; she said when she found her, &#147;look 
what Mako-chan got for me.  He&#146;s a special present,&#148; she 
explained as she held out the bear for Setsuna to see.  
&#147;I want to show them my other special present.  Can I, 
please?&#148;
	Setsuna smiled and nodded at her little girl.  &#147;You 
may if you&#146;d like,&#148; she answered.  &#147;Have Haruka-papa get 
it for you so I can finish setting things up in here.&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; answered Hotaru.  She turned to Makoto and 
Ami.  &#147;Wait here.  I&#146;ll be right back,&#148; she said as she 
ran off to get Haruka.
	Setsuna turned and offered the girls a polite smile.  
&#147;Good afternoon,&#148; she said to them.  &#147;How are you both?&#148;
	Their bit of pleasant small talk was interrupted a 
few minutes later as Hotaru came back into the room.  
&#147;Smile,&#148; she called happily to them.
	Makoto smiled for her and almost laughed at what 
she saw.  The teddy bear had been tucked into the large 
pocket on the front of Hotaru&#146;s overalls.  Hanging from 
one of the belt loops on the side was her 35mm camera, 
just the way it had been when they&#146;d arrived.  And held 
up to her eye was a shiny, new camcorder.
	Haruka appeared in the doorway behind Hotaru.  She 
leaned against the doorframe, a proud, &#145;I made my 
daughter happy&#146; grin on her face.
	Makoto waved at the camera even as she felt Ami 
going shy beside her.  &#147;What an incredible present,&#148; she 
said.
	Hotaru lowered the camera and hurried over to show 
it to them.  With a little help from Haruka, she pointed 
out all the bells and whistles.  &#147;I got the good kind of 
batteries with it,&#148; she went on.  &#147;The ones that last for 
seven hours at a time, so I can record lots of stuff.  
And it takes still pictures, too.  They get saved on a 
special computer card so I can print them out.  I&#146;ll show 
you.&#148;
	The camera was lifted back to her eye and pointed 
at Ami.  Hotaru pushed a few buttons on top, then held 
the camera so they could see the still frame on the swing 
out mini screen.
	&#147;Cute picture,&#148; smiled Makoto, to which a slight 
blush appeared on Ami&#146;s cheeks.
	Hotaru giggled.  Then she remembered the secret 
Chibi-usa had told her, and that it had been long enough 
so it wasn&#146;t a secret anymore.  &#147;I almost forgot,&#148; said 
Hotaru around her smile.  She moved the camera back 
around and set it to record.  Then she asked, &#147;Did you 
and Ami have a good first anniversary?&#148;
	Makoto stared at the little girl slack-jawed.  Out 
of the corner of her eye, she noticed a similar surprised 
expression on Ami&#146;s face.  Looking around she also 
noticed the small, knowing smile Setsuna wore as she 
pretended to ignore them and set up the table, as well as 
the surprise turned amused smirk on Haruka&#146;s face.
	Accepting what she now considered to be the 
inevitability of it all, Makoto laughed and draped an arm 
around Ami&#146;s shoulders, pulling the surprised girl closer 
to her.  &#147;Yeah, Hotaru,&#148; she answered.  &#147;We had a very 
good anniversary.&#148;


*            *            *

	It didn&#146;t take long for the others to arrive at the 
party.  And, once Chibi-usa was there, it didn&#146;t take 
long for Makoto to realize how Hotaru had found out about 
her and Ami.  Makoto watched the two girls together and 
wondered how much information Hotaru was privy to.  It 
felt just a bit disconcerting to her to realize at that 
moment just how much Chibi-usa knew about all their lives 
when they themselves had yet to experience it.
	Those thoughts were put behind her, however, as the 
party was moved into full swing.  Over the next few hours, 
food was served, cake and ice cream were handed out, and 
presents were opened and joyfully exclaimed over.
	Somewhere early in, the new video camera had been 
passed off to Hotaru&#146;s parents.  Hotaru had kept her 35mm 
with her, periodically stopping to take pictures of the 
people around her.  It seemed she was determined to take 
enough shots to fill up the photo album that had been a 
gift from Minako.  The rolls of film that had come with 
it provided her nicely with enough ammunition to achieve 
that goal.
	Makoto stood by the snack table and poured herself 
another cup of soda.  Rei and Minako had pulled Ami away 
from her and, in helium induced squeakiness, were trying 
to convince the girl that sucking the air out of balloons 
was high entertainment.  On the floor not far from them, 
Hotaru, Chibi-usa, Haruka, and Usagi huddled around the 
game that was a present from Usagi as Michiru and Setsuna 
sat nearby and watched.
	Chibi-usa finished pulling another of the plastic 
sticks from the center of the marble filled Kerplunk 
cylinder.  The marbles stayed firmly in place, and the 
girl sighed in relief.
	It was Usagi&#146;s turn now.  The blonde&#146;s tongue poked 
out between her lips as she concentrated on the yellow 
stick between her fingertips.  Very slowly, she pulled it 
out.  There was a slight shift inside the cylinder, but 
the marbles didn&#146;t fall.  A triumphant grin spread across 
her face at her success, and she laid the newest stick 
with the few others she had already removed.
	Makoto smiled for Usagi and chuckled quietly at the 
show Haruka put on before taking her turn.
	Cracking her knuckles, then rubbing her palms 
together quickly, Haruka set to her task.  After a 
moment&#146;s thought, she chose a green stick and carefully 
began to pull it from its place.  The stick was halfway 
to its goal when one of the marbles slid out of place and 
fell to the tray below.  Haruka froze mid pull.  It was a 
futile effort, however.  Another marble fell, quickly 
followed by another and another, until all the remaining 
marbles came cascading down in a loud clatter.
	Haruka hung her head in defeat and sighed while 
pointedly ignoring Usagi and her happy gloating.
	&#147;Aw, it&#146;s okay, Haruka-papa,&#148; said Hotaru.  She 
scooted over and wrapped her arms around Haruka&#146;s back.
	&#147;Maybe I should lose more often,&#148; said Haruka 
quietly.  &#147;Come &#145;ere you,&#148; she said as she pulled Hotaru 
into her lap and began to tickle the girl&#146;s ribs.
	Over Hotaru&#146;s laughter, Makoto heard another voice, 
slightly altered from what she usually heard.  She looked 
over and saw Ami, balloon in hand and cheeks reddening 
after her mouse like squeak.  Minako clapped her hands 
and begged Ami to do it again as Rei laughed lightly.
	Makoto watched her friends&#146; antics and thought to 
herself that sometimes it was hard to tell who were the 
children and who were the adults.  With that thought came 
another that had been nagging at her off and on all 
afternoon.
	Not wanting to disturb the happy atmosphere and 
feeling the need to take a few moments and collect her 
thoughts, Makoto allowed herself to wander a bit.  
Without intending it, she wound up in a dark room and 
stood looking out the pair of French doors that led to 
the backyard.
	The early evening sky was clear and littered with 
stars.  What little there was of the moon shone brightly.  
Makoto searched for several minutes until she found the 
right star.
	&#147;Hi, Mom,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;I miss you.  I wish 
you could be here for all of this.&#148;  Then she smiled a 
bit sadly.  &#147;And I&#146;d love for you to tell me how I&#146;m 
supposed to handle this one.&#148;
	&#147;How about with a little help from your friends?&#148; 
asked Haruka as she flipped on the light.  When Makoto 
turned to her, Haruka added, &#147;Sorry if I&#146;m interrupting, 
but for some reason, people start to get nervous when you 
disappear.&#148;
	Makoto chuckled at that, then said, &#147;I didn&#146;t think 
anyone would notice so quickly.  I just wanted a few 
minutes to myself and wound up feeling like I should say 
hi to her.&#148;
	Haruka walked up beside Makoto and looked out into 
the sky with her.
	Makoto smiled to herself after a moment&#146;s silence.  
Once upon a time, if her mother had been here when she 
and Haruka first met, Makoto was certain she wouldn&#146;t 
have done what she was about to do.  &#147;Mom, this is my 
friend, Haruka.  Haruka, my mother.&#148;
	Bowing politely, Haruka responded, &#147;I&#146;m pleased to 
meet you, Kino-san.  Makoto is a very good friend, and 
it&#146;s my honor to know her.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s smile widened.  &#147;I think she likes you, 
though she thinks you should let your hair grow out a bit 
more.&#148;  She laughed lightly at the look on Haruka&#146;s face 
and added, &#147;Mom always liked it when I brought my friends 
home.  It made her happy, I think, to know that I wanted 
to show her off rather than hide her.&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m glad you introduced us,&#148; answered Haruka.  
&#147;And I meant what I said about being your friend.  So if 
you think you need to talk about something?&#148;
	Makoto shifted a bit uneasily.  As much as she 
considered Haruka to be a friend, this wasn&#146;t something 
she felt the blonde would take well.  &#147;Thank you,&#148; said 
Makoto, carefully weighing her words, &#147;but this is 
something I need to talk about with someone else.&#148;
	&#147;Someone else, huh,&#148; said Haruka with a smirk.
	Slight color rose in Makoto&#146;s cheeks.  &#147;Yeah,&#148; she 
answered.  &#147;I was going to tell you about it later 
tonight.  Hotaru just beat me to it.&#148;
	Haruka laughed.  &#147;I knew something strange was 
going on with her when I picked her up from school on 
Tuesday.  When I dropped her off she was worried about 
you and wanted to call to make sure you were really 
okay,&#148; explained Haruka at the questioning look Makoto 
gave her.  &#147;Then, when I picked her up, suddenly 
everything was fine because you &#145;had Ami to take care of 
you&#146; and we shouldn&#146;t disturb you because you needed some 
&#145;alone time.&#146;  Michiru is the only person who has ever 
used that phrase with her, and it was in regards to 
something very specific.  Congratulations, by the way,&#148; 
grinned Haruka.  &#147;On your &#145;anniversary.&#146;&#148;
	&#147;Thanks,&#148; answered Makoto.  &#147;At least now I know 
for certain when I&#146;m supposed to get her a gift.&#148;
	&#147;So,&#148; nudged Haruka gently, &#147;is this what you&#146;re 
out here skulking around in the dark about?&#148;
	Makoto smiled at the older girl, seeing through her 
ploy.  &#147;No,&#148; she answered.  &#147;It&#146;s not.  Things with Ami 
are good.  This is the first time something like this has 
ever felt completely right to me.  More than that, it&#146;s 
fun.  It&#146;s never been fun before,&#148; she said as she turned 
her eyes back to the stars.
	~The difference between being used and being 
loved,~ thought Haruka.  She placed an arm casually 
around Makoto&#146;s shoulders.  Her grin turned teasing as 
she said, &#147;Fun, hmm.  You know, Mako-chan, if you ever 
need any tips on different ways for the two of you to 
have fun&#133;&#148;  She waggled an eyebrow at the younger girl, 
then laughed as Makoto blushed a bright rose that not 
even Ami could rival.


*            *            *

	Makoto lifted the butterfly figurine from the 
bookcase and smiled at it briefly before wrapping it in 
several layers of newspaper and placing it in the box at 
her feet.  Straightening back up, she placed her hands 
against her back and tried to stretch out the kinks she 
felt forming.  She&#146;d forgotten what a pain moving could 
be.  In this case, very literally.
	A second pair of hands joined Makoto&#146;s against her 
back.  The heels of Ami&#146;s hands kneaded gently against 
Makoto&#146;s sore muscles.  &#147;How about a rest?&#148; she said.
	&#147;I want to finish these shelves first,&#148; answered 
Makoto.  &#147;If I stop now, I&#146;m not going to start again.&#148;  
She sighed, then complained, &#147;This is an awful lot of 
trouble to go through just to move between floors.&#148;
	&#147;It will make it all easier on the other end,&#148; 
assured Ami.  She nodded to the books that stood alone on 
one of the shelves.  &#147;I suppose I should take those 
home.&#148;
	Makoto frowned.  &#147;You know, I think we should take 
a break from this after all.  Come and sit with me for a 
minute, would you?&#148; she asked.  She then led a curious 
Ami over to the couch.
	When they were both seated, Makoto stated very 
bluntly, &#147;I want to tell your mom.&#148;  At Ami&#146;s near 
panicked look, Makoto took the smaller girl&#146;s hands in 
hers and held them tightly.  &#147;I don&#146;t want to force you 
to do something you don&#146;t think you&#146;re ready to do, and I 
know I said I would give you time.  I just didn&#146;t realize 
it would be this long.  It&#146;s been nearly a month already, 
and&#133; well&#133;&#148;
	&#147;I&#146;m sorry,&#148; said Ami weakly.
	Makoto shook her head.  &#147;No, Ami, there&#146;s no reason 
for you to be.&#148;  One hand reached up to gently touch 
Ami&#146;s cheek.  &#147;But I&#146;ve been thinking about some things, 
and I have reasons for wanting to do this now.  Hear me 
out, okay?&#148;
	Ami nodded.  &#147;Okay.&#148;
	Letting her hand drop back down, Makoto played 
their fingers together nervously as she spoke.  &#147;First 
off, your mom&#146;s been good to me.  She&#146;s one of a very few 
who hasn&#146;t looked down on me or treated me like a stupid 
kid for getting pregnant.  And, by letting you stay here 
all the time, she&#146;s also given me a certain amount of 
trust and responsibility.  It feels too much like we&#146;re 
running around behind her back, and I don&#146;t like feeling 
as if I&#146;m betraying the trust she&#146;s put in me where 
you&#146;re concerned.&#148;
	Ami looked at her in surprise.  &#147;Mako-chan&#133;&#148;
	A finger pressed to her lips stopped Ami from 
saying anything else.  &#147;There&#146;s more, and I want you to 
hear all of it before you say anything.&#148;
	Ami nodded, and Makoto let her finger fall from the 
other girl&#146;s lips.
	&#147;I started thinking about this when we were at 
Hotaru&#146;s party,&#148; continued Makoto.  &#147;It kept nagging at 
me then, but I wanted some time to think before I said 
anything to you.  Thing is, I didn&#146;t realize just how 
little time I have to deal with this, and with the move 
in only two weeks, it&#146;s all creeping up on me fast.  So, 
I guess now is as good a time as any to bring it up.  You 
see, what kept bugging me was that, other than Chibi-usa, 
there were no children at that party.&#148;
	 Ami&#146;s eyebrows knitted together in confusion.  &#147;I 
hadn&#146;t realized that, honestly,&#148; she said slowly, 
thinking back to that afternoon.  &#147;Everything seemed to 
be the way it normally is when we&#146;re all together, so I 
didn&#146;t really think about it.&#148;
	Makoto nodded.  &#147;You wouldn&#146;t, because for us, that 
was normal.  But for anyone looking in from the outside, 
it wasn&#146;t.  Very little about that situation is.  And she 
doesn&#146;t have any friends, Ami,&#148; said Makoto sadly.  &#147;For 
all that Hotaru goes to school, and swim class, and art 
class, and gymnastics, she didn&#146;t have a single normal 
friend at that party to sing to her or play games and 
make a ruckus the way they did at my ninth birthday party.  
And I can&#146;t stop wondering why.&#148;
	&#147;Mako-chan,&#148; said Ami as she gently stilled 
Makoto&#146;s nervous fingers in her own, &#147;Hotaru can be a 
very shy child at times.  That&#146;s part of the reason they 
have her in so many activities.  And keep in mind,&#148; added 
Ami with a small, self-conscious grin, &#147;not all of us had 
people outside our families at our birthday parties.&#148;
	&#147;I suppose so,&#148; answered Makoto, giving Ami&#146;s hands 
a squeeze.  &#147;But I couldn&#146;t help feeling like there was 
something wrong with it, regardless of how happy she 
seemed.  Like maybe Hotaru had figured out that her 
parents don&#146;t fit into the standard definition of normal, 
and she was too embarrassed by them to bring her friends 
around.  But the more I thought about that,&#148; said Makoto, 
a low chuckle issuing from her throat, &#147;the more I 
realized how not true it is.  I&#146;ve never met a little 
girl more adoring of her parents.  That led me to 
something else.
	&#147;What if it wasn&#146;t her?&#148; asked Makoto.  &#147;What if 
the other kids know her family is different and avoid her 
for it?  Or maybe it&#146;s their parents who are saying 
things or just not letting their children play with her 
or go to her house.  Hotaru shouldn&#146;t be treated any 
differently from anyone else just because of who and what 
her parents are.  That isn&#146;t fair to her.  And it isn&#146;t 
going to be fair to Bug,&#148; concluded Makoto quietly.
	Ami&#146;s insides were doing flip flops.  It must have 
shown on her face, Ami thought, because Makoto reached up 
and lightly began running her fingers through her hair.  
Some stray pieces were tucked carefully behind Ami&#146;s ear 
in a gesture she felt was supposed to be reassuring.
	&#147;Bug&#146;s never going to be a normal little kid, Ami,&#148; 
said Makoto softly.  &#147;How can he be when his mom&#146;s a 17-
year-old, lesbian Sailor Senshi who has to leave him with 
a babysitter in the middle of the night to go blast youma 
with the Moon Princess?  Especially when his other mom is 
the exact same thing.&#148;
	Ami startled at that, and Makoto laughed.
	&#147;He&#146;s got a kabillion aunts.  He doesn&#146;t need 
another one,&#148; said Makoto.  &#147;Besides, I can tell that&#146;s 
what you want by the way you talk about him.  Admit it, 
Ami, you like the idea of a little person running around 
calling you &#145;Mama.&#146;&#148; 
	Through a shy smile, Ami said, &#147;Ami-mama.  It will 
make things less confusing.&#148;
	&#147;Ami-mama,&#148; Makoto repeated with a grin.  &#147;I like 
it.  It&#146;s cute.&#148;
	A slight blush added to the shy smile Ami already 
wore.
	&#147;I need to do things right for him, Ami,&#148; said 
Makoto.  &#147;If I can&#146;t give him normal, then I have to at 
least try for stable.&#148;  She took a deep breath, then let 
it out slowly.  Looking Ami in the eyes, she continued, 
&#147;I don&#146;t want you to take your books home unless home is 
the new apartment.  I want you to move in with me.  For 
real this time.  No more playing house and pretending 
until it&#146;s time for you to go back to your mom&#146;s.  I love 
you, and I think we can do this.&#148;
	For a moment, Ami sat, feeling slightly overwhelmed 
by it all.  Then she shifted so she was on her knees on 
the couch.  Her arms wrapped around Makoto&#146;s neck, her 
forehead resting against Makoto&#146;s as her eyes closed.  
She stayed like that for several minutes, finding peace 
and comfort in Makoto&#146;s arms, which had gone around her 
waist to hold her.
	&#147;I&#146;m afraid to tell her,&#148; admitted Ami.  &#147;I don&#146;t 
know why.  I just am.&#148;
	Makoto&#146;s hold tightened a fraction.  &#147;I&#146;ll be there 
with you if you want,&#148; she said softly.  &#147;You don&#146;t have 
to face her alone.&#148;
	&#147;This weekend,&#148; replied Ami.  &#147;She has off, and I 
was planning on spending some time there.&#148;
	Makoto tugged on Ami until the girl slid onto her 
lap.  Ami&#146;s head rested against Makoto&#146;s chest.  She 
listened to Makoto&#146;s heartbeat as the taller girl cradled 
Ami against her and whispered soft reassurances.  
Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ami began to feel the 
pressure of time Makoto had been talking about.  Suddenly, 
the four days she had until the weekend seemed incredibly 
small and insignificant.
