<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 18 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Ami Mizuno drove with the same kind of efficiency she
brought to most of her jobs, diverting just enough of
her attention to the road while considering what else
she was doing. &#39;Mistress Nine is still too much of a
unknown,&#39; she mused, &#39;I need more data.&#39;

The parking garage was dark as the sports car smoothly
slid to a stop, the shadows concealing the corners and
making it a likely place for an ambush. Thankfully,
Ami had already prepared for that possibility.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Minako&#39;s voice came over the concealed ear
piece, &quot;I&#39;ve scanned your surroundings with my suit
sensors, there&#39;s only regular background noise. We&#39;re
also ready to deploy if there&#39;s any boomer surprises.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Ami answered as she took the case from her
car, the microphone in her suit collar transmitting
her voice to the other Senshi Sabers.

Walking away from her car, Ami headed to space number
A-29, the one they had arranged to meet at. A voice
from the shadows called, &quot;That&#39;s far enough, Ms
Mizuno.&quot;

&quot;You wanted to talk to me,&quot; Ami kept herself looking
relaxed, &quot;so talk.&quot;

&quot;You brought the money?&quot; the woman&#39;s voice asked
warily.

&quot;As I promised,&quot; Ami raised the case and set it on the
back of a car, &quot;and I can add a bonus too, if the
information you provide is worth it.&quot; She popped the
latch and opened it to reveal the bundles of cash
within, &quot;Well?&quot;

&quot;What do you want to know?&quot; the woman sounded much
more relaxed.

&quot;Any and all information on Mistress Nine,&quot; Ami said
to her calmly, &quot;and the super Bio-Boomer project.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice sounded amused, &quot;I had heard
you already had that data through Hotaru Tomoe.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like to corroborate that data,&quot; Ami answered
mildly.

&quot;Understood,&quot; the woman&#39;s voice became entirely
business like, &quot;here&#39;s what I know...&quot;

Ami drove out of the garage nearly ten minutes later,
case much lighter and her expression grim. &quot;Did you
record all that?&quot; she asked as she pulled into
traffic.

&quot;Every word,&quot; Minako answered. &quot;Do you want us to meet
you back at the Silky Doll?&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Ami agreed, &quot;we have much to discuss.&quot;

The Silky Doll lingerie and clothing shop was Ami&#39;s
cover as well as her hobby, a place where she could
put aside the incredible weight of her mission and
deal with mundane things like convincing people to buy
something a little more racy than they were used to.

The company van pulled in just as Ami arrived, the two
of them pulling into the underground parking side by
side. Ami slip from her seat gracefully, her silk
skirt whispering as she waited for the others to get
out of the van.

Makoto opened the driver&#39;s door and jumped down, her
brown ponytail bouncing against the athletic woman&#39;s
back. Minako bounced from the back, her golden hair
sparkling even as Rei followed, her long black hair
echoing her serious expression.

&quot;Was this cloak and dagger crap worth it?&quot; Rei asked,
her leather jacket flapping around the slim woman. She
looked sexy in the painted on jeans and muscle shirt,
seemingly unaware of it as she stretched gracefully.

&quot;I think we learned some new information,&quot; Ami
managed, gulping past the arousal that tightened her
throat.

&quot;Thank god I didn&#39;t have a rehearsal today,&quot; Rei
grumbled as they headed inside the store, &quot;I think
some of my bandmates are starting to wonder.&quot;

&quot;They think you&#39;re a Senshi Saber?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;No they think I have a secret girlfriend,&quot; Rei
groused, &quot;they&#39;re teasing the hell out of me over it.&quot;

Makoto chuckled, &quot;Bring one of us over, we can pretend
to be your girlfriend. Might ease off on the teasing.&quot;

&quot;Sorry Mako-chan,&quot; Rei smiled wryly as they reached
the elevator upstairs, &quot;you&#39;re not really my usual
type.&quot;

Ami hesitated but had to ask, &quot;So what is your usual
type?&quot;

Rei looked over at Ami, faintly surprised to see such
curiosity from the cool woman. &quot;Usually the office
lady type,&quot; she admitted, &quot;and I&#39;ve been known to help
bring out the occasional curious straight girl.&quot;

&quot;Ooh, bad girl,&quot; Minako teased as the elevator
smoothly carried them up.

&quot;Don&#39;t you run a fairly good chance of getting your
heart broken with those kind of girls?&quot; Makoto asked
curiously.

&quot;It&#39;s not that serious,&quot; Rei said with a cocky grin.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Ami kept her voice tightly under control as
she lead them out of the elevator then down the hall
to the meeting room. Forcefully she tried to drive out
any images of Rei and her probable conquests, but they
teased the edges of her mind.

Minako raised a eyebrow at Ami&#39;s terse manner, the
group of them following her into the meeting room only
to see three women waiting there for them. She
recognized Setsuna immediately, Ami&#39;s friend and
associate sitting patiently waiting, but the two
younger women she had difficulty placing.

&quot;Ladies,&quot; Ami said briskly, &quot;you all know Setsuna, of
course, and her companions are Haruka Tenoh and
Michiru Kaoru.&quot;

&quot;Yo,&quot; Haruka waved hello, the sandy blonde casually
sitting in one of the larger chairs beside Michiru.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Rei fixed her with a look, &quot;does this have
something to do with their visiting a few days
ago...?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry that Ami didn&#39;t tell you the truth at the
time,&quot; Setsuna quickly jumped in, &quot;but I asked her not
to talk about it.&quot;

&quot;Something interesting happened?&quot; Minako looked around
interestedly.

&quot;Not quite the way you think,&quot; Ami smiled slightly.
&quot;Grab a seat, everyone, this is going to take some
time to explain.&quot;

Rei grabbed a chair and sat, the look in her eyes
showing she had not forgiven Ami for any deception.
Makoto sat with Minako as she also asked, &quot;And does
this have something to do with why you didn&#39;t want
Haruka helping with her sports car a few weeks back,
too?&quot;

&quot;Ami and Setsuna were trying to protect us,&quot; Michiru
said with a certain kind of formal dignity, &quot;forgive
them.&quot;

&quot;Protect from who?&quot; Rei pushed, &quot;Who the heck are you
two anyway?&quot;

Haruka&#39;s eyes narrowed a bit, &quot;Watch the tone, Hino.&quot;

Ami cleared her throat loudly, preventing things from
going any further. &quot;If you don&#39;t mind,&quot; she said
frostily, &quot;I&#39;d like a chance to explain.&quot;

&quot;Well done,&quot; Setsuna smiled slightly.

&quot;As many of you know there was a program to create
Super Bio-boomers,&quot; Ami took on a faintly lecturing
tone, &quot;which so far has created five subjects. One of
them is our opponent, Mistress Nine, and another is
Hotaru Tomoe.&quot;

&quot;And these three are the rest?&quot; Minako offered. As
everyone looked at her in surprise Minako
shrugged:&quot;Seemed like a good guess.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Setsuna acknowledged, &quot;I was the first
prototype that DR. Mizuno created, while Haruka and
Michiru represent the second generation.&quot;

&quot;And Mistress Nine and Hotaru are the third?&quot; Rei
asked after a moment.

&quot;More like one and a half,&quot; Ami cut in. &quot;According to
my source Tomoe was working with incomplete data when
he created Hotaru and Nine,&quot; she revealed,
&quot;technically speaking Haruka and Michiru are more
advanced.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s good, right?&quot; Makoto asked, &quot;They&#39;re stronger
than her?&quot;

&quot;No, they&#39;re not,&quot; Setsuna jumped in.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Minako blinked.

&quot;They&#39;re more advanced and simulate humans better,&quot;
Setsuna said, &quot;but that means their strength is
actually closer to a real humans.&quot;

&quot;Crap.&quot; Rei sighed. She looked over at Haruka, &quot;So you
and Michiru were at my concert because of Setsuna? Or
Ami?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Haruka sighed, &quot;we snuck out. And both of them
gave us grief over it.&quot;

Makoto snickered softly, &quot;I can imagine.&quot;

Rei, oddly, relaxed just a bit. &quot;Good,&quot; she said, &quot;I
thought you were both fans and didn&#39;t want to be
disappointed.&quot;
