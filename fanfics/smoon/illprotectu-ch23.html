&#39;I want to know who I am&#39;

You are Minako Aino

&#39;That is my just my name&#39;

That is who you are

&#39;I want to know who I am and continue what I have left behind&#39;

And then?

&#39;Then...I...I don&#39;t know. Maybe I&#39;ll go back to the people who are 
waiting for my return...and then I&#39;d be happy&#39;

Are you sure?

&#39;What do you mean by &quot;are you sure&quot;?&#39;

You are hiding something from me,

&#39;N-no-I&#39;

From your parents and from your manager friend

&#39;Go away!&#39;

You are hiding something that you&#39;re not even sure that is TRUE

&#39;I said GO AWAY!&#39;

--

Minako&#39;s brows are furrowed as her sweat runs through her forehead. She 
was having a bad dream. She keeps on murmuring as she unconsciously 
shakes her head

&quot;Go away...please&quot; She yelped at her sleep

A figure approached her and wiped the tear that is flowing from the 
blonde beauty&#39;s closed eyes and wiped the sweaty bangs of her beloved&#39;s 
forehead. There are some few, small scars left on the blonde girl&#39;s face 
from last month&#39;s accident but it&#39;s not the type of scar that is 
permanent. Rei found the now almost invisible stitched scar on Minako&#39;s 
left forehead, which was the former pop star&#39;s worst injury. Good thing 
the rest is covered by her hair which seems to be still having normal 
growth. Minako relaxed from the hold as she tiredly goes back to sleep

&quot;Stop it, Mark&quot; A whisper came out of a raven-haired girl kneeling 
beside a sleeping Minako

&quot;Aw, you&#39;re no fun Hino-chan&quot; As another figure became visible and sat 
on the half-opened window

Seeing that the raven haired girl did not care about the comment, Mark 
decided to just silently observe his new comrade. Rei is holding her 
unconscious lover&#39;s hand as gently as she could to not wake her up. 
Treasuring the moments with the former pop star that is now sleeping 
peacefully

&quot;It&#39;s been three weeks since she met that talented doctor. I couldn&#39;t 
even believe myself when Leonard told us that Ms. Aino already 
remembered a lot&quot; Mark started

&quot;I&#39;m glad for her...&quot; Rei smiled sadly

&quot;Mark...&quot; She added

&quot;I know. Don&#39;t worry. Leonard&#39;s been doing this for you, you know. And 
I&#39;m not really stopping you from following your girlfriend. So long as 
no one recognizes you&quot; Mark said as he walks to the dark area of 
Minako&#39;s room and disappears

Rei looked at where Mark was for a moment and looked back at her 
sleeping love. She covered Minako&#39;s shoulders with the blanket

&quot;I wish I could see you everyday. But I have lots of things to do for 
Sanctuary. I&#39;ll see you again next week, Mina-chan. I&#39;ll keep an eye on 
you always. I love you and I miss you&quot;

Rei thought of kissing Minako on the lips but she refrained, thinking 
that it would wake the blonde. She left a butterfly kiss on Minako&#39;s 
forehead instead then followed Mark

--

Minako opened her eyes. She had completely forgotten about the dream. 
For some reason she feel refreshed, probably because of the cool breeze 
coming from the window. Then she noticed that the window is half-opened. 
The last thing that she was sure of before going to sleep last night was 
to close the window. But then she thought it was just her imagination. 
She rises up and walks to the window to close it. She smiled as snows 
slowly fall outside

She sits up on her bed and stretches up her arms. And then she covered 
her mouth as she yawned

Minako noticed that her hand smelled like roses. She smelled it again as 
she stands up. She must have held something before her sleep last night, 
or perhaps she held something while she was sleeping. She smelled her 
pillow and teddy bear stuff toy, but they have different scents. She 
smelled her other hand, and was surprised to know that it doesn&#39;t have 
the same scent of roses as the other one. She walks around her room to 
find it, while smelling the sweet scent from her left hand

&quot;If it&#39;s not teddy or my pillow, then what did I hold last night? I like 
this scent...&quot; then Minako looked at the window, she sweat-dropped. A 
window can&#39;t smell like that, but she tried anyway

She went back to bed and buried her face in her thick blanket. After a 
few seconds her head shot up and grabbed the blanket to smell it

&quot;Oh, so that&#39;s where the scent came from&quot; She said to herself

A knock was and Mrs. Aino opened her daughter&#39;s door, finding her 
kneeling beside her bed while smelling a blanket

&quot;Honey, are you alright?&quot; She asked

&quot;Oh, good morning mom&quot; Minako stands up and fixed the blanket and smiled 
at it

&quot;It seems that my lovely daughter is in a good mood today&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s because of the blanket mom&quot;

&quot;My, does it smell? I&#39;ll call the laundry maid to-&quot;

&quot;Oh, no mom it doesn&#39;t smell, not all&quot; Minako stopped her mom

&quot;Alright, then go take a bath now, the water&#39;s warm already. Ms. Wendy 
is waiting for you outside&quot; Minako nodded and proceeded to the bathroom

--

-Few Hours Later-

Minako and her manager Wendy are inside the car on their way to a 
rehearsal studio. Minako brought her new laptop, which was given by her 
dad two weeks ago. Wendy watched her silently

Minako has been watching her own concerts and music videos from the 
internet since Wendy told her to. She couldn&#39;t help but to be amazed and 
amused that she can sing and dance while wearing super thin high heels

&quot;I never thought you&#39;d ask me to coach you on singing and dancing. I 
know you&#39;ll eventually know how to do it again. Just like before&quot; said 
Wendy

&quot;...When I watch this, I really feel that I can do it again. When I 
checked the mailbox you gave me, there are lots of email messages like 
&#39;Get well soon, ne?&#39; or &#39;We&#39;ll always wait for your return&#39; and &#39;Please 
be well and sing for us again&#39;...those messages make me overwhelm with 
joy&quot; Minako said dreamily

&quot;You&#39;re being cheerful these days. That&#39;s what you always are. So I&#39;ll 
take it as a good sign&quot; Wendy nodded approvingly as she smiled

The car stopped and parked at a fast food restaurant. Wendy went out to 
buy breakfast since they didn&#39;t take one. Minako stayed in the car. She 
is so relieved that she now had the time to do her secret research

She had installed a search software on her laptop. The first thing in 
her mind is to investigate her own identity. She gathered all sensuous 
information, biographies, headlines and articles that can easily help 
her remind who she is and what happened to her before losing her memory. 
She was surprised herself that she gathered much

&#39;My, I had three boyfriends before and I&#39;m the one who broke up with 
them? They must be like jerks or something&#39;

Few days ago, she retrieved some articles posted regarding her accident 
in Tokyo a month ago. Some of them tell obvious lie, some uncertain. She 
couldn&#39;t help but laugh when one of the articles says she was kidnapped 
by some diehard fans. She now reads the next article

Minako stopped from reading. She saw a picture of her with a very 
familiar raven-haired girl behind her and Wendy

&quot;She&#39;s here! I can&#39;t believe I saw you in another picture again!&quot; Minako 
whispered in excitement as she continued reading the article. But there 
are no information regarding Rei. There is one thing she is sure though, 
Wendy actually knows Rei. She just couldn&#39;t get why no one mentioned 
anything about her

&quot;...I&#39;m so happy...&quot; She caresses Rei&#39;s face on the picture

She saw Wendy about to enter the car door. She immediately saved the 
picture and closed everything in her laptop. Wendy handed her hot coffee

&quot;Here you go. You need to eat because we have a long day today. You 
still have an appointment with your Psychiatrist&quot;

Minako looked at her manager curiously

&#39;Am I going to ask her?&#39;

&quot;What is it Minako?&quot; Wendy asked when she noticed the young girl look at 
her

&quot;Nothing! I just noticed that you&#39;re happy Ms. Wendy&quot; Minako reasoned

Wendy shook her head as she smiles. Then she shrugged, as if something 
went into the manager&#39;s mind

&quot;Erm...Minako?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ms. Wendy?&quot;

&quot;Call me Wends&quot;

&quot;Sure. What is it Wends?&quot;

&quot;Since it&#39;s Christmas...I was wondering if...&quot;

Minako encouraged her to continue

&quot;I was wondering if I could take a week off. I miss my family and--&quot;

Minako froze. Has she been this selfish that she completely forgot about 
Wendy&#39;s sake?

&quot;Of course! Wendy you don&#39;t have to feel bad that you&#39;re leaving for a 
while. I can take care of myself and I have my parents with me&quot; Minako 
smiled as she takes her manager&#39;s hand

&quot;You&#39;ve been on my side ever since. I don&#39;t even know how to repay you 
for all the things you did for me. I would be more than happy to give 
you a month off if one week isn&#39;t enough&quot;

Wendy smiled and pats Minako&#39;s head

&quot;Thanks Aino&quot;

--

--Rei&#39;s Room at Sanctorium--

Rei silently watched the television. She had her rest today. For the 
last few weeks that she&#39;s been with Sanctuary, they had gone from place 
to place. Stealing some artifacts and blackmailing corrupt politicians 
in a weird way. Sometimes she wonders what is in Mark&#39;s mind, for he is 
the one who plans their missions. Thanks to Rei&#39;s police instincts 
Sanctuary somehow knows how police authorities think and act. She lifted 
a handgun that Henry gave her. She remembered her days when she was 
still a police agent

&quot;I wonder how big boss and the others are doing?&quot;

Rei stood up and placed down the gun on the couch she was sitting and 
walked to the terrace of her room. She stood there and stared at nowhere 
for a while until she heard Minako&#39;s name mentioned on the television

&quot;Yes everyone, our beloved pop star, Minako Aino is currently preparing 
herself for the most awaited come back in showbiz industry. Next week 
will be her first press conference after the incident in Tokyo...&quot;

&quot;I see...So that&#39;s why Leonard told me she was so busy these past few 
days&quot; Said Rei to herself then turned her attention back to the 
television. But the topic about Minako is finished already. She picked 
the remote up and turned off the T.V.

She walked towards her bed and picked up a book to read before resting 
on her bed

A knock was heard from her door

&quot;What is it?&quot;

The door opened and behind it revealed a teenage boy, the same age as 
Rei and has blue hair and charming smile. He smiled at Rei thinking it 
would brighten up the reticent girl

&quot;Hey Rei! Want to come with me to London right now? I need to go to this 
laptop exhibit that I don&#39;t wanna miss!&quot; Said Leonard, the youngest 
member of Sanctuary

Rei didn&#39;t look at him. She&#39;s ignoring the young man by continuing to 
read the book. Leonard pouted

&quot;Come on Rei please! Grey and Henry won&#39;t come with me because they&#39;re 
playing PS3, I don&#39;t want to bring Edward along because he&#39;s creepy, and 
Mark would be the last person I want to ask. He won&#39;t even allow me 
unless I&#39;m with one of you guys&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not interested with that kind of stuff&quot; Replied Rei

&quot;You don&#39;t really have to be there, you can go your own way and then we 
meet up after the exhibit. Come on Rei, you&#39;re my only hope please&quot; 
Begged Leonard

No reply from the raven-haired girl

&quot;You get to see Minako Aino again...&quot; He added with a sweet tone

Rei lifted her head a little then looked at Leonard

--

--Hours Later, Dr. O&#39; Farell&#39;s Clinic-

&quot;You are avoiding my questions for some reason Ms. Aino&quot;

&quot;Why would I do that??&quot; Exclaimed Minako as she stands up and stomps her 
hands on the top of an office table

In front of her is sitting a young psychiatrist about thirty years of 
age. He has brushed up brown hair, a pair of brown-black eyes behind the 
thick eye glasses and a thin beard below his chin. He was a bit 
surprised at Minako&#39;s sudden temper but regained his posture and managed 
to smile calmly

&quot;I was just asking questions Ms. Aino. Questions that will further guide 
me to help you remember who you are&quot; The Psychiatrist stands up and 
approached Minako

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Dr. O&#39; Farell, but I&#39;m trying my best to answer them. You&#39;re 
asking me pointless questions and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to help me 
anymore&quot; Reasoned the pop star

&quot;I believe we&#39;ve already made a big progress, Ms. Aino. You already 
remembered your childhood and pieces of your middle school days. But I 
actually know what you wanted to know&quot; Dr. O&#39; Farrell replied

&quot;And that is?&quot; Minako asked him to continue

&quot;You wanted to remember something that you&#39;ve been hiding from us. 
You&#39;re afraid to trust anybody, even your parents who loved you so much&quot; 
He simply answered

&#39;I can&#39;t really hide anything from a Psychiatrist&#39; Thought Minako

True that she remembered bits of her past. But there are still no traces 
of the famous pop star Minako Aino. No memory of Rei, the mystery girl 
that&#39;s been on her mind. She&#39;s been hiding it. But she didn&#39;t want to 
think that the kiss on the picture was a fake either, that the kiss with 
the girl was out of fun, not true love. That&#39;s what she was afraid of

&quot;It&#39;s just...there&#39;s this girl in the picture. She was with us before 
the incident in Tokyo. I couldn&#39;t stop thinking about her, and nobody&#39;s 
talking about her or how she is related to me&quot; Minako said without 
thinking

The Psychiatrist smiled again. He sensed an honest uncertainty from her 
patient

&quot;I see. So that&#39;s been bothering you all along...This girl...might be an 
important person to you. It might be because this person was involved in 
one of the most unforgettable moments in your life. But if no one 
mentions anything about her, she might be just a type of person that 
people most likely to forget&quot; He explained

&quot;W-what do you mean?&quot; Minako voice is cracking for some reason

&#39;If you only see how beautiful this girl is...I&#39;m sure you will never 
forget her face&#39; Minako wanted to tell this to her Psychiatrist

&quot;For example, she might be just a person dropping by your concert. Or 
she could be a simple laundry maid at the hotel, could be an assistant 
secretary, perhaps a tour guide. In other words, she may have just a 
small role in your life&quot;

&quot;Then why do I always think of her if she&#39;s just that kind of person!?&quot; 
Minako couldn&#39;t believe what she&#39;s hearing

&quot;Ms. Aino, you&#39;re afraid of losing what you believe is the only clue to 
who you are. You actually think that this person will actually answer 
all the questions you don&#39;t want to ask me or the people around you. 
That&#39;s why you keep thinking of her&quot;

Minako shook her head and she retreated a few steps backwards

&quot;So you&#39;re telling me I&#39;m just imagining this person!?&quot;

&#39;The kiss, the warm feeling, those unreadable amethyst eyes&#39;

&quot;No, I&#39;m just telling you the possibilities Ms. Aino. You can&#39;t just 
base everything on your own judgments since you yourself are not sure 
who you are&quot; Dr. O&#39; Farell said, but his calm face turned into a worried 
one when Minako held her head with both of her hands then she covered 
her ears as she shakes her head

&quot;Ms. Aino, are you alright?&quot;

Minako&#39;s mind is full of voices. Words full of doubt and fear. And then 
a blurred image of a raven haired girl appeared in her mind. Answering 
the questions that has been on her mind ever since she saw the picture 
of Rei

I can&#39;t answer who you are. I don&#39;t even know you

Why do you think so much of me? Because of that kiss?

I never meant that kiss

I&#39;m just a girl in the picture

I don&#39;t really care about you

I am just a plain stranger who became a part of your life for a short 
time

You&#39;re making a fool of yourself and the people around you

&#39;You&#39;re lying!!&#39;

&quot;Nnnnooooo!!&quot; Minako slapped away Dr. O&#39; Farell&#39;s careful hand and runs 
madly out of the door

&quot;Ms. Aino!!&quot; The Psychiatrist called back then he followed

--

Outside in the lounge Wendy was startled when Minako rudely pushed away 
the door and ran out to the elevator. Seconds later Dr. O&#39; Farell 
followed

&quot;Aino!-Doctor what happened??&quot; Wendy managed to ask as she tries to 
catch up with the Psychiatrist

&quot;I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s my fault that she&#39;s been acting like that. I 
should&#39;ve known she&#39;s not ready yet for any negative answers&quot; He replied 
breathlessly

&quot;There she is! Minako! Calm down and stop!&quot; Called Wendy, but Minako 
didn&#39;t answer

Minako reached the elevator and pushed the down button continuously. The 
Elevator door opened and she slammed her body gently inside and the 
elevator closed. Wendy and Dr. O&#39; Farell were too late

&quot;Ms. Denverland, take the other elevator, and I&#39;ll take the stairs quick 
and call the security for help&quot; Dr. O&#39; Farell runs on the fire exit. 
Wendy nodded and waited for the other elevator

--

--On a nearby caf&eacute; across the road--

Rei is sitting on one of the tables outside the caf&eacute;, she&#39;s pretending 
to a read newspaper so that no one will recognize her. She lets out a 
deep sigh. She&#39;s been waiting for almost two and a half hours and still 
no sign of a certain blonde girl coming out of the building across the 
road

&quot;What took them so long...Usually Leonard tells me that each session 
only lasts an hour...I should have not believed him&quot; She mumbled to 
herself

She looked at her watch, she still have an hour before Leonard arrives 
to meet her up. She taps her index finger impatiently on her coffee 
table. Then she overheard a woman talking behind her

&quot;Just be patient and Minako-chan will come out there anytime by 
now...I&#39;m going to remind you again, once she gets out of that building 
I want you to focus on her face and nothing else, alright?&quot; The woman 
said. Then the man she is talking to nodded, he is carrying a huge case 
that may seem to use to store video cameras

&#39;Crap&#39; She cursed on her mind

Rei&#39;s blood drained on her face. She just realized that the caf&eacute; is full 
of media people in disguise waiting for Minako. Sanctuary&#39;s leader, 
Mark, strictly reminded her not to expose her face in any media sort. 
She picked her cell phone and dialed Leonard&#39;s number

&quot;What is it?&quot; He answered on the other line

&quot;Meet me somewhere else. I&#39;m surrounded by cameras here. I bet they&#39;re 
waiting for Minako&quot; Whispered Rei

&quot;I see. I can&#39;t think of a better place but I&#39;ll just go there now. Be 
careful&quot; Then Leonard hangs up the line. Rei was about to look at her 
watch once again when Minako runs out of the building. The pop star was 
running away for some reason

&#39;Minako!?&#39; Rei stands up and run to follow her blonde lover, she was 
almost hit by a car but managed to make it on the other side of the road 
in time. The media people in the caf&eacute; were alarmed and followed the pop 
star in sight. But they are having a hard time crossing the road since 
they&#39;re in groups

Rei ignored her haired being carried by the wind as she runs after her 
beloved Minako. Good thing she is wearing jeans and sneakers for her to 
run faster. Unfortunately Minako is wearing heeled leather shoes

&quot;Damn Minako, you still run fast even if you&#39;re wearing high heels!!&quot; 
The raven haired girl hissed

Minako managed to cross another road but Rei this time is not able to do 
it because of the speeding cars. But she is still in track of Minako 
across the road

&#39;She&#39;s not even looking where she&#39;s going!&#39;

Rei couldn&#39;t take it anymore because it&#39;s dangerous

&quot;Minako! Stop!!&quot; She yelled. But Minako did not hear her

Minako is crossing another road. Her left shoe-heel broke and she lost 
balance in the middle of the road

&quot;Minako, look out!!&quot;

Minako closed her eyes. Another image of Rei flashed

&#39;BEEEEP! BEEEEP!&#39;

Rei puts all her strength in her legs and feet to run to her love&#39;s 
rescue

&#39;SCREEEECCHH!!&#39;

Minako and Rei lay limply on the sidewalk. The driver of the car that 
almost hit them panicked and drove his car away from the scene, thinking 
that he killed somebody. Rei opened her eyes and regarded the pop star. 
She looked for any signs of blood or injury. Her mind sighed when she 
found none

&quot;Minako? Minako!?&quot;

Minako stirred. Her vision&#39;s a bit blurry after opening her eyes but as 
the image became clear, she saw a very much alive face of the girl that 
has been on her mind. A tear drops down on her pale cheeks. Rei was hurt 
with the way Minako looked at her like she was in pain. Then Rei 
panicked when the pop star sobbed

&quot;M-Minako? Are you alright?&quot; She carefully asked

&#39;Why is she crying??&#39;

Minako pushed Rei away, making her sit on the floor. She looked at 
Minako with a worried and a questioning look

&quot;Minako...It&#39;s me...Rei...&quot; The raven haired girl whispered that only 
Minako can hear

&#39;Do you remember me?&#39;

Minako shakes her head and stands up. She retreats carefully but she 
never took her upset eyes off Rei. Rei slowly stands up. Some people are 
looking at them

&quot;...I am your bodyguard back in Tokyo...Hino Rei&quot;

&#39;Please remember&#39; Rei felt like crying at that time

Minako continued to cry silently as she stares at what she thought is 
another image of Rei on her mind. She couldn&#39;t take it anymore

&quot;It&#39;s you again!! Why do you keep on showing up!! You&#39;re just a part of 
my past! It&#39;s your fault that I keep thinking of you! You&#39;re just my 
imagination! GET OUT OF MY MIND! GET OUT!!&quot; Minako shouted and pushed 
Rei but not in a rude manner

Rei&#39;s tears finally fell on her cheeks. Minako turned her back and 
continued running away

The raven-haired girl stood frozen in the middle of the city. Her mind 
and body seemed to have given up working. She couldn&#39;t feel herself 
breath

Then suddenly a young man hugged and dragged her away from the curious 
crowd before the media catches up with them

&quot;Rei! Get a hold of yourself! What happened there? I saw Minako Aino 
walked away from you&quot; A concerned Leonard asked as he pulls Rei on the 
walkway like a child. Rei finally controlled her body and lets go of 
Leonard&#39;s hand making the young man stop walking

&quot;Are you okay? Want me to follow Minako?&quot; Asked Leonard worriedly

Rei thinks for a few seconds. She wiped her tears and shook her head

&quot;N-No. Just...make sure she will be alright&quot; Then Rei continued walking. 
Leonard followed while he calls his contacts to keep an eye on Minako

--

Minako goes inside a church, where she thought was the safest place to 
stop, think and rest

&quot;I...made her go away...but...how come she looks so alive that time?&quot; 
She mumbled to herself. She couldn&#39;t remember what this &#39;imaginary Rei&#39; 
told her, the only thing she remembered was when she was pushing her 
away. Telling the girl to get out of her mind

&quot;How come it felt so real?&quot; Minako hugged herself with her arms. Then 
she noticed that her cell phone&#39;s been ringing all along. She went out 
on the churchyard and answered the phone

&quot;Hello?&quot;

&quot;Minako! Honey it&#39;s mom! Where are you!? Wendy called us and she&#39;s been 
trying to call you numerous times but you&#39;re not answering!&quot; Her mom 
said on the other line

&quot;I&#39;m sorry mom. I was just upset and confused earlier&quot; Minako said. Her 
mom&#39;s voice is cracking, she might be crying. Minako sighed and felt 
sorry for worrying everyone

&quot;Where are you? We&#39;re going to pick you up&quot;

--

--Evening in Sanctorium, back in UK--

Rei sat quietly outside the parking lot of the mansion. She&#39;s still 
thinking of what happened earlier with Minako. Her mind is now flooding 
with questions. Leonard looked at her with pity and decided to let her 
be. As he walks inside of the mansion he saw Grey about to go out and 
make fun of the raven-haired girl

&quot;So how&#39;s the date with Lenie?&quot; He asked as he winks on Leonard. The 
blue-haired teenager ignored Grey&#39;s nickname for him. He holds Grey&#39;s 
broad shoulder to hold him back and glared at the taller man

&quot;What?&quot; He asked

&quot;Not now&quot; Hissed Leonard. Grey looked at Rei. The girl is burying her 
head on her knees. Realizing that something went wrong his face changed 
into a serious one and then he turned back. Asking Leonard what happened 
on their way inside the mansion

&#39;Does she remember me already? Is she blaming me for what happened to 
her?&#39;

&#39;It&#39;s all my fault. I involved her in this mess. I should have known 
that this will happen&#39;

&#39;She has the right to hate me...But I couldn&#39;t stand it. It hurts so 
much to see her look at me like that...How can I ever face her again? 
How come after all that happened I still can&#39;t protect you?&#39;

&#39;I&#39;m such an idiot&#39;

&quot;Please don&#39;t hate me...Minako...I need you&quot; Rei whimpered. She stayed 
outside the whole night. She didn&#39;t care if the snow is starting to 
cover the ground

She locked herself in her room the next day. Grey has been trying to 
knock on the raven-haired girl&#39;s door the whole morning

&quot;Hey cop girl, you better open the door, or else I&#39;ll break it down!&quot; He 
shouted impatiently. Minerva, Rei&#39;s nurse is nervously standing next to 
him

&quot;M-master Grey, I think we should let Ms. Rei be. I just talked to her 
few hours ago and she seems to be fine so-&quot;

&quot;How come she lets you in and won&#39;t let me? Rei! I need to give you 
something! Mark will--&quot;

The door knob suddenly turned and opened. Rei glared at Grey, who 
stepped back. She reached her hand to the gray-eyed man. Grey was 
silent, Rei&#39;s eyes are a little red, the girl probably cried all night

&quot;What? You&#39;re going to give me something right?&quot; She finally said. Grey 
remembered and gave a white envelope with winged lion seal. Rei did not 
bother to look at it and closed the door behind Grey and Minerva

&quot;I&#39;m sorry master Grey, Ms. Rei must be not in the mood...&quot;

&quot;That girl is always not in the mood&quot; Grey sighs and walks away, leaving 
Minerva alone in the hall.

Rei threw the letter on her desk. She picked up two books before going 
back to bed. Seconds later her cell phone rang in her pocket. She 
answered it with her eyes and mind still focused on the book she&#39;s 
reading

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Hino-chan, have you read the letter I gave you?&quot; Mark said on the other 
line

&quot;Not yet. I&#39;m busy&quot;

&quot;Tsk tsk tsk. How come you&#39;re only nice to Minako-chan? Anyway, you 
might want to read that John Grisham (1) book later. What&#39;s inside the 
letter is more important to you, believe me&quot; Mark said playfully and 
then hung up. Rei growled in annoyance

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll read it if it will make you happy&quot; She walked back to her 
desk and picked up the envelope to open it. Rei read the content and her 
serious eyes turned to worried ones. She rushed outside her room

Rei ran towards Mark&#39;s office. The red-eyed man seems to expecting her

&quot;When did you get this!?&quot; Rei asked as she holds a cut part of an old 
Japanese newspaper. It says: TNPH HEAD CHIEF NAMADA HINO, HOSPITALIZED

Mark took a page of the same paper Rei is holding. It&#39;s only half the 
page of a common news paper. The other half was torn out

&quot;I happen to feel like eating Japanese ramen this morning. A friend of 
mine, the owner of the restaurant I was eating at was reading this 
newspaper. I saw this header and asked him about it. Unfortunately the 
article about it was missing so I only asked for this particular page. 
This paper was four days ago&quot; Mark stated

Rei balled her right fists, the piece of newspaper she&#39;s holding 
crumpled

&quot;No need to blame yourself Hino-chan. Leonard immediately called his 
asset there and they said your uncle was hospitalized due to fatigue. He 
seemed to be overworking himself since you left. Don&#39;t worry, he&#39;s fine 
now. He was already out yesterday and was given a week of rest&quot;

&quot;...I see&quot; Rei calmed a bit and turned to leave. But Mark continued to 
speak

&quot;Leonard told me about yesterday&#39;s encounter with Aino-san. How are 
you?&quot;

As he expected Rei stopped but did not reply

&quot;So it&#39;s that bad? Hino-chan, your girlfriend&#39;s press conference will be 
three days from now. You might want to plan something&quot; He continued, 
trying to tease the girl. Not expecting the silent reply Mark stands up 
on his chair and hands out a credit card to the raven-haired girl

&quot;This is from Sanctuary. Buy whatever you want on Christmas. You can go 
to London and have fun without any of us following you around. But you 
will have to go back here after Christmas of course. It&#39;s our Christmas 
present for you&quot; He explained

Rei remained silent. She nodded and takes the credit card like an 
obedient girl, and then walked out of Mark&#39;s office. Mark was slightly 
surprised that Rei did not act the way he expects her to

&quot;I wonder what really happened. Normally she would say that it&#39;s none of 
my business. I&#39;ll never understand that girl&quot; Mark commented

&quot;What do you think, Eddie?&quot; He turned his head to Edward, who has been 
there sitting on Mark&#39;s office couch all along. Mark sweat-dropped when 
Edward didn&#39;t reply and kept caressing his face with a white feather 
muttering &#39;she didn&#39;t even notice that I&#39;m here&#39;

&quot;I thought I got rid of that stupid feather...how many does he have in 
his room anyway?&quot; Whispered Mark to himself

--

Days after what happened, Minako asked her manager Wendy to put her 
appointments on hold to her Psychiatrist. She focused herself on singing 
and doing dance practices to forget about the raven-haired girl and what 
the doctor said even just a little

As Christmas day approaches Minako noticed her mom and dad were worried 
at something. She wanted to ask them but doesn&#39;t have the courage to do 
so. She is afraid that she won&#39;t understand and she doesn&#39;t want to 
upset them. Sometimes before she goes to sleep she heard Wendy talked to 
them about something but she couldn&#39;t understand what they are saying

Today Minako is determined to find it out. Pretending to ready herself 
for her press conference inside her room, she pressed her ear on the 
door and concentrated on their conversation

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mrs. Aino, we already extended your stay here. I tried my 
very best to extend it again until Christmas but they refused&quot; Wendy 
said to her parents guiltily. Mrs. Aino shifted on her sit uncomfortably

&quot;Honey, I know she will be alright. Minako had two Christmas without us 
remember?&quot; Mr. Aino comforted her wife

&quot;But Minako is still recovering. We can&#39;t just leave her when she needs 
us the most&quot; Replied Minako&#39;s mother. Mr. Aino sighed as he picks up the 
phone and dialed. After a few minutes he puts down the phone looking a 
little stressed

&quot;My friend from the flight agency said this week is fully booked and the 
earliest schedule they can give us is next week after Christmas&quot; He said

&quot;What are we going to do Ms. Wendy? Minako will be alone this Christmas 
if we can&#39;t stay&quot; Mrs. Aino asked

&quot;...I guess I have no choice but to stay with her while you are away&quot; 
Wendy replied. Mr. Aino stands up

&quot;We don&#39;t want you to cancel your plans because of this Ms. Denverland. 
We&#39;ll just stay until Christmas and pay the penalty on the days we 
exceeded our stay&quot;

Minako opened the door and interrupted them

&quot;Mom, dad, you don&#39;t have to go that far for me. I&#39;m okay by myself 
here. It&#39;s just four days and you&#39;ll be back here right? So don&#39;t worry 
about me. I can manage&quot; Minako said and then she holds her mother&#39;s hand

&quot;We can&#39;t just leave you here, honey. You know we are worried for you&quot; 
Mrs. Aino replied

&quot;And I love you both. You have done so much for me that I don&#39;t know if 
there&#39;s any word that will be better than &#39;Thank you&#39;. When you&#39;re back, 
we&#39;ll celebrate our own after-Christmas party with dad and Wendy. How 
about that?&quot; Minako offered her mom. Mrs. Aino smiled but her eyes are 
still filled with worry

&quot;I&#39;ll be a good girl&quot; She added as she gave her best smile. Her mom 
could never refuse that sweet smile from her daughter

&quot;Besides, my place is not far from here so I can always drop by and 
check Minako&quot; Wendy assured. Mrs. Aino looked at Minako in the eyes

&quot;Are you sure about this, Minako?&quot; She asked. Minako nodded eagerly

&quot;Minako Aino is independent. So that&#39;s what I should be. I need to try 
not to depend on others too much. And this my chance&quot; The determined pop 
star said

Mrs. Aino sighed in defeat. But was comforted with her daughter and 
husband

&quot;The flight&#39;s tomorrow afternoon. I left it blank on Minako&#39;s schedule 
so that she can see you in the airport. After that Minako will proceed 
to the press conference&quot; Wendy said sadly

Mrs. Aino stands up and bows at Wendy, Mr. Aino and Minako bowed as well

&quot;We are grateful for everything Ms. Denverland. Please take care of 
Minako as much as you can&quot; Mrs. Aino finally said

Wendy felt a little embarrassed being bowed at. But she understands that 
it is a sign of respect and gratitude for Japanese people

&quot;Please, I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s necessary to do that since we&#39;re not 
in Japan right now. On the other hand, you can spend time with each 
other since there&#39;s nothing to do much today&quot; Wendy smiled and then went 
outside. Minako&#39;s parents nodded and hugged their daughter once again.

The next day Minako says good bye to her parents in the airport. Mrs. 
Aino even cried for she doesn&#39;t want to leave her daughter especially 
that it&#39;s Christmas Eve

&quot;Mom, don&#39;t be sad. I&#39;ll call you and dad every ten seconds if you want&quot; 
Minako said, trying to cheer up her mom

Minako&#39;s dad kissed his daughter&#39;s forehead

&quot;Be safe honey. Try to enjoy yourself this Christmas okay?&quot; Then he 
gently assisted her wife to the boarding area

&quot;We love honey&quot; Her mom called

&quot;I love you too. I&#39;ll see you next week!&quot; The pop star replied. She 
watched as her parents walk away and disappear from the crowd

Suddenly everything went slow in Minako&#39;s vision. The environment 
changed but it still looked like an airport. She saw an image of herself 
going out of the airplane door, smiling with all elegance. Then she saw 
a raven-haired girl, wearing black slacks and blouse standing in front 
of her. The girl&#39;s face is blurred, only a pair of very visible amethyst 
eyes was seen. The girl smiled reached a hand to her, and Minako was 
about to reach her own hand to the girl when...

&quot;Minako?&quot; Wendy suddenly called her

Minako blinked a couple of times. She looked left and right, and then 
walked to where the boarding area is. There were passengers boarding the 
plane. She was back to reality

&quot;Minako are you alright?&quot; Wendy asked again

&quot;Ms. Wendy...I think I just had a vision. I saw myself going out of the 
airplane. I&#39;m wearing elegant clothes and...and...&quot;

&quot;...And what?&quot; Wendy asked her to continue but Minako didn&#39;t reply

&quot;It must be one of your past concert tours that you&#39;re seeing. It only 
means that you&#39;re remembering some of your pop star days Minako&quot; She 
continued. Minako looked at her with uncertainty but nodded

&quot;Well, we&#39;ve got to hurry. We still have some press conference to attend 
to&quot;

--

--Press Conference, London--

Minako thought she can handle crowds now. But when she and Wendy sit 
down in the middle of people from different media stations, she felt 
like throwing up in nervousness. Wendy saw her client&#39;s discomfort and 
gave her a pat at the back

&quot;Relax Minako. You don&#39;t need to answer all their questions if you don&#39;t 
know the answer. Leave it to me&quot; She said to the pop star

Minako nodded and took a deep breath before accepting questions from the 
press

Most of the questions were answered by Wendy, since Minako had no idea 
what her album producer plans for her. Then the next question is the 
question Wendy expected

&quot;Minako, after your accident in Tokyo, you couldn&#39;t remember anything. 
But now that you&#39;re starting to recover, can you please tell us if you 
remember something about the incident so we could know what really 
happened?&quot;

Minako looked at the press. Everyone is silent and is waiting for her 
answer. She bowed her head and closed her eyes. Flashes of images came 
through her mind, trying to focus on the voices that only she herself 
can hear

Thinking that Minako didn&#39;t know the answer either, Wendy replied to the 
question

&quot;As you have stated on your question, Minako is still recovering. I&#39;m 
afraid she can&#39;t answer your ques-&quot;

&quot;There was a loud explosion...after my concert&quot; Minako suddenly 
answered. Wendy&#39;s mouth was left open. Minako is trying to tell them 
what she&#39;s seeing on her mind, pieces of images, but she was starting to 
remember one by one

&quot;We were running, trying escape out of the place to safety. But we were 
cornered...and then I was kidnapped by some sort of masked people...And 
after that everything went dark. That&#39;s all I remembered&quot; She finally 
finished. After that Wendy took over and answered the rest of the 
questions

After the press conference Minako kept silent. She didn&#39;t expect to 
remember things like that. She kept trying to remember it again while on 
their way back to the her condo unit

&quot;Minako, it seems that you&#39;ve been remembering things today. I am 
worried that it will keep bothering you&quot; Wendy said to her

&quot;I couldn&#39;t explain why but...I want to remember it. The things I said 
earlier were just bits of images flashing in my mind. It&#39;s like a film 
with skipped scenes, there are missing pieces, and I need to know them&quot; 
Minako replied then looked at Wendy

&quot;But don&#39;t worry about me. Today is the day before Christmas, and we 
should be enjoying ourselves. You&#39;re going home as well right? I&#39;ll ask 
the driver to drive you at your place&quot; Minako added

&quot;Yes. That will be great&quot; Was all Wendy can say

--

--Back at Minako&#39;s Condominium unit--

Wendy felt miserable leaving Minako. Although Minako is smiling she 
knows the girl is just trying not to worry her

&quot;I&#39;ll call you once I arrive&quot; She said to the pop star

&quot;Please say hi to your folks for me&quot; Minako said

&quot;Minako, do you want to come with me instead? It&#39;s really lonely here 
you know&quot;

Minako looked down, like she was thinking. Then she looked back at Wendy 
and shakes her head

&quot;Thanks but I have something else in mind. Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll enjoy my 
Christmas the best way I can!&quot; She gave a thumb up to Wendy who smiled

&quot;Very well. If you need something call me anytime okay?&quot;

Minako nodded and waved goodbye to her manager

&quot;Happy Christmas Wendy, I hope you enjoy!&quot; Then as Wendy closes the door 
Minako sat lazily at her couch. She looked outside the window and 
watches the snow fall outside. Her mom decorated her room so that she 
can feel the Christmas spirit, although it doesn&#39;t make her

&quot;Happy Christmas...Minako&quot; She said to her self.

Minako ate the Christmas cake her mom and dad bought for her. Then she 
watched television until drowsiness takes over. She is too sleepy to 
change to her pajamas so she just rests herself to bed and closes her 
eyes to sleep

Seconds after closing her eyes she opened it again. She&#39;s having another 
vision. She is lying on the ground in the middle of a wide road, for 
some reason she can&#39;t move her body. Her head hurts, as if she has an 
injury. Then she heard voices, speaking Japanese and then someone yelled 
her name

&quot;I said...MINAKO-NEEDS-HELP!&quot;(2)

&quot;Rei-san...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t go anywhere...until I see that Minako&#39;s doing fine!&quot;

Minako tried to open her eyes. She saw the same raven-haired girl on her 
first vision. This time, it&#39;s clear that the picture of the girl in her 
cell phone and this girl are one

&quot;R-Rei...chan?&quot; She whispered but no sound came out from her mouth. The 
girl&#39;s head is bleeding, covering one of her beautiful amethyst eyes. A 
man is trying to help her but the girl refused and tried to stand up the 
best her feet can still failed. Then another man held her other arm and 
they brought her away from Minako&#39;s sight

&quot;Please, let go! Minako! MINAKOOOO!!&quot;

MINAKOOOO!!

MINAKOOOO!!

MINAKOOOO!!

&quot;...Please remember me&quot;

Minako closed her eyes and opened it again. She&#39;s back in reality again, 
but this time she&#39;s breathing heavily. She sits up and tried to calm 
herself but is failing

&quot;R-Rei...Rei...&quot;

All that happened before and after the concert are now coming back to 
her memories

&quot;...Rei...Rei...&quot;

It doesn&#39;t matter when or how long we have met each other. If you feel 
that I am the right person then you should feel the same way that I do. 
Do you feel what I feel, Rei? (3)

Rei-chan...I&#39;m here for you. And no matter how angry or mad I am to you, 
I&#39;ll never let you go. I&#39;ll never leave you, because I can&#39;t live 
without you and I love you so much...(4)

An image of Rei formed in her mind and smiled at her

...I love you, Minako

Tears came out of Minako&#39;s sparkling blue eyes

&quot;REI-CHAN!!&quot;

Minako ran outside without thinking. She didn&#39;t know where to go, but 
the only thing she has in mind is to find Rei. She remembered now, Rei 
is the very love of her life. That&#39;s why she kept thinking of her even 
the time she couldn&#39;t remember anything. She felt guilty for trying to 
push her out of her mind. Lots of things are starting to flood in her 
head, but the only thing she&#39;s feeling right now is worry and 
nervousness

&#39;The last time I saw Rei-chan on my vision was her being taken away by 
some men. That was more than a month ago...Oh please I hope nothing 
happened to her...I can&#39;t bear losing her, I can&#39;t live if anything 
happens to her&#39;

&quot;Rei-chan where are you!?&quot; Minako started to yell in frustration. There 
are few people on the streets because it&#39;s Christmas Eve. People are too 
busy to look at her

Minako saw a police station nearby. She wanted to go there and tell them 
about Rei, but she stopped because she just realized something

She just realized that everything happened in Tokyo. And she is in 
London right now. She sobbed and shook her head

&quot;No...Rei-chan...Rei...&quot; She covered her face with her hands and cried 
to where she&#39;s standing. She&#39;s all alone now. She started to walk slowly 
away from where she&#39;s at, not caring where her feet will take her

--

Rei sighed for how many times, she couldn&#39;t them count anymore. She&#39;s 
glad Mark had given her two days of freedom. Two days without Sanctuary. 
She bought her self a new lavender fur coat and wore it the instant that 
she bought it. She visits all the open bookstores in London, buying the 
all books she&#39;s interested at. She regrets that she did not go to 
Minako&#39;s press conference. The memories of what happened between them 
days ago are still fresh in her mind. She is afraid that if Minako sees 
her again, the blonde girl will totally hate and reject her. She noticed 
a couple happily going inside a classy restaurant, cuddling each other. 
Rei smiled sadly

&#39;This should have been my first Christmas with Minako...&#39;

Rei felt a stinging pain on her right arm. It&#39;s been a month and her 
right arm is not fully recovered yet. She thought she was over using it, 
she decided to go back to the hotel where she&#39;s staying for the night

But on her way she saw a very huge Christmas tree in the middle of the 
plaza. It is beautifully designed with candy canes, shiny gold, green 
and red balls, sparkling strings and a radiant star at the top. The snow 
also added beauty in it. Rei decides to stop and rest while enjoying the 
view

&quot;I wish Minako can see this as well...&quot; Rei muttered, her breath taking 
out a small fog due to the climate. She heard someone crying softly. She 
looked left and right and at her back but she didn&#39;t see anyone crying. 
There only few people in the plaza. Most of them are at home celebrating 
the holiday

Rei took a step forward and looked behind the huge Christmas tree. She 
saw a slim blonde girl about her height, her hair disheveled and she&#39;s 
not wearing any winter clothes or fabrics that will warm her. Her face 
is covered by her hands, letting Rei know that this is the girl she 
heard crying. She walked slowly towards the girl

&quot;Uh...Are you okay?&quot; She asked carefully

Minako stopped crying instantly. She knows that voice very well. The 
voice she&#39;s been dying to hear again. Minako slowly removed her hands 
from her face and lift her head to see the owner of the voice

She was never mistaken. Her eyes were wide open in disbelief. It was 
none other than Rei

Rei stood frozen on where she&#39;s standing. She didn&#39;t realize that it was 
Minako all along

Rei and Minako stared at each other, alone in front of the huge 
Christmas tree. Minako&#39;s tears were falling endlessly on her cheeks as 
there stands a few feet away the person she&#39;s been looking for. Rei 
doesn&#39;t know what to do as her beloved looks at her like she&#39;s in need. 
Rei looked away from Minako, feeling the guilt that&#39;s been conquering 
her heart

&quot;Rei...Rei-chan?&quot; Minako asked, her voice is breaking

Rei heard Minako says her name and looked back at her. She seems to be 
different than the last time they met

&quot;Is this for real? You&#39;re here...you followed me here!&quot; Minako ran 
towards Rei and hugged the raven-haired girl fiercely. Rei couldn&#39;t 
believe what&#39;s happening. Tears finally flow uncontrollably from her 
amethyst eyes

How did I get here?


I turned around and there you were.


I didn&#39;t think twice or rationalize,


&#39;Cuz some how I knew,


That there was more then just chemistry


I mean I knew you were kind of into me,

But I figured it&#39;s too good to be true

&quot;Is it really you, Rei?&quot; Minako asked as she buries her face on Rei&#39;s 
neck. She smelled the scent of roses, the scent that only Rei has

&quot;...It&#39;s me, Mina-chan. Welcome back&quot; Replied Rei as she hugs back her 
blonde love. After a few minutes they looked at each other, Minako 
closed her eyes and lifted her lips for Rei to kiss. The brunette 
finally kissed her lovingly, the kiss that she has been missing badly

The only witness that night is the moon, the snow and the huge Christmas 
tree

They say that good things take time,

But really great things happen in a blink of an eye


Thought the chances to meet somebody like you were a Million to one


I can&#39;t believe it

You&#39;re one in a million (5)

Happy Christmas, Minako...
