<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was a snuggler.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  arm was wrapped tightly around her waist, keeping her close. One of  them, she wasn’t sure which, had kicked the sheets into a bundle at the  foot of the bed, so Usagi’s only source of warmth was the miko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not that she minded of course.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  deliriously happy grin crossed her face and she inched even further  into Rei’s arms, tired to the point of collapsing, yet energized at the  same time. Rei grumbled something about, ‘baka odangos’ and hugged  Usagi even tighter. Usagi frowned. Huh. Talk about rude.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  glanced of her shoulder and saw that sunlight was streaming through the  closed blinds. She resisted heaving a sigh and, surprisingly, crawled  out of Rei’s arms and padded to the bathroom to look in the mirror. She  blinked. The girls at school had said after having…she cut off the  thought with a blush…that your body would look different. Usagi stared.  Well, nothing looked different.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh…is that…” She fingered a red  spot on her shoulder. “Oh…jeez…hey there’s another one…and one  there…and one…Whoa! All the way down <em>there</em>? She’s good…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,  what are you looking at?” cam Rei’s voice, rough with sleep. Usagi  eeped crossed her arms over her chest, whirling around to see Rei  rubbing at her eyes. The miko lifted a brow at Usagi’s show of modesty.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why are you doing that? It’s not like they’re something I’ve never seen before.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  let out a shriek of outrage and grabbed a tube of toothpaste before  chucking it at Rei. The girl let out a yelp of pain as the plastic tube  connected with her head, leaving a good lump in its wake.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Jeez Odango-Atama!” Rei snarled. “What the hell was that for!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shove it!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, I’ll shove my fist up your—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pervert!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">&quot;<em>Ass</em> you stupid bimbo, <em>ass!</em>&quot;</span></p>

It  was odd how after last night, after the intimacy they shared, that they  could bicker and squabble like usual. But even the semblance of  normality that enveloped the two of them, it was still a mistake. A  beautiful, wonderful, terrible mistake that should have never crossed  her mind. She should have better control over herself. Rei opened her  mouth to apologize, yet couldn’t speak as soon as she caught a glimpse  of Usagi. There was a flush to her cheeks that had never been there  before, a sudden shift in her aura that radiated absolute joy.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The afterglow, Rei noted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She had to consciously wipe the  arrogant smirk off her face and she was once again thrown into the pits  of despair at the thought that Chibi-usa, Crystal Tokyo, everything  might cease to exist because she had been a big baby. She cursed  savagely under her breath. She had to tell her it had been a mistake.  If she made it hurt as much as she possibly could, she’d show the  princess that her heart wasn’t the place Usagi had described to her  before, that last night should have been shared with Mamoru, that it  had been one big mistake. Yeah… that’s what she would do. But not right  now.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">If this was the last day she could ever spend with Usagi, in peace, then by God she was going to make it last.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Catching Usagi off guard, Rei pinned her to the wall of her bathroom and kissed her deeply.</span></p>
She was going to make this last for the both of them.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Usagi  sighed in bliss as she ignored Minako’s meaningless chatter on the  phone. Three straight hours of absolute heaven, considering she finally  got to act out a particular dream that involved ice-cream, chocolate  syrup, whipped cream, and Rei covered in all three—
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan? Are you listening to me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh? Oh, uh gomen  Minako-chan! I was…day-dreaming…” About a particular miko in the  kitchen and passing wonder if Rei like strawberries…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“About Mamoru?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Huh?  Oh, no, not about him.” There was a gasp on the other end of the phone.  “Oh, c’mon Minako-chan. It’s not like the world’s about to end.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  wouldn’t jinx it if I were you Usagi-chan!” Minako teased. “Anyway  how’s Rei-chan? Y’know, after the other day with her father—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She’s fine.” Usagi assured with a secret grin. “Oh yeah. Juuuuuuust fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’s that tone young lady? Oh, did Rei get lucky? Yuuichiro huh?” Usagi blushed, yet kept her grin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Actually, it was me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was silence, before Minako stuttered out, “No way!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes way.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<strong>You</strong> got laid!?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Uh-huh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“By Mamo—“</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Minako growled at the dial tone. “Motherfu—“
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako, sweetie,” Setsuna scolded gently as she turned a page of  her book, “Please keep the profanity down to a minimum if you can.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Sets-chaaaaaaan! Usagi’s keeping me in suspense!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Patience is a virtue darling.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh, where’d you hear that; a fortune cookie?”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Rei  led Usagi out of the shrine and into the backyard, going slowly as if  to prolong the heartbreak that was sure to overcome them both soon.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Rei-chan, did you know that the sakura trees are one of the most mysterious trees in the world?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Rei choked. “No I had no idea.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah,  I didn’t either.” The joke didn’t wring a laugh out of Rei like she  planned. In fact, the miko’s lips pressed together in a tight, white  line.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan,” Usagi began</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Last night was a mistake.” Rei forced. “As was this morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi’s eyes widened and her breath caught in her throat. “You don’t mean that…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  should have never happened,” Rei continued, her voice cracking as she  turned around. “It was all wrong. You weren’t supposed to…with me…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop  it.” Usagi ordered as she grabbed the fabric of Rei’s shirt. The miko  was trembling. “You’re lying. I know you are. I don’t know how, or why  this happened, but Rei-chan, I don’t regret a single—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you  will!” Rei screamed, shoving the blonde away and sending her sprawling  to the ground. She grabbed the sides of her head and hunched over. “You  will regret it! Late one night, you’ll think, ‘Why did I let that  monster touch me!?’ And then, you’ll scream and rage and feel guilty  about something that wasn’t even your fault!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!  I’m trying to protect you; I’m doing my fucking duty so let me do it! I  don’t care if you’ll look at me one day and curse the day I was born! I  don’t care if you hate me for the rest of your life! I want”-<em>To be with you</em>-“You to be happy and safe!” Silver trails of tears trickled down her cheeks. “I’m just trying to protect you Usagi-chan…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi swallowed back her own set of tears. “Rei…I—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Bang.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Shock  is the greatest drug known to man. It’s not illegal, and it’s not  deadly. It will numb your mind, body, and soul. And, as a plus, there  are several stages to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Surprise.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s body jerked once, before she began to fall forward.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Realization.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her  breath hitched in her throat as the patch of red on the front of Rei’s  robes began to steadily grew larger and ruby red spilled from her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Denial.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  God…No!” Usagi ran and caught the girl before she hit the ground,  shuddering when warm blood soaked through the miko’s robes. “Rei?! Rei!  Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Fear.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my God! Rei! Wake up! Rei! Stay with me, wake up!”</span></p>
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And finally…</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi left Rei only to grab the phone and run back out, dialing 911 immediately.</span></p>
<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Acceptance…</span></em>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“911 Emergency, how can I help you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Please! My friend’s been shot!”</span></p>
