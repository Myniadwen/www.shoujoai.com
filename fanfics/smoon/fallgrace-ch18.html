<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 18 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Rei knew she had a goofy grin on her face, she knew that people were 
staring at her and she also knew Kajiura-san was laughing at her 
silently somewhere. But that didn&#39;t matter.

She got it.

She got the necklace Hotaru wanted. No one else would have been able to 
get it for her, not Haruka, not Setsuna, not Usagi, not Hikari and not 
Megumi. Sure they could just duplicate it, but it wasn&#39;t the same thing.

A warm body tackled her, arms wrapping around her neck the second she 
walked out of the changing room. She didn&#39;t have to look or to even 
think to know who it was.

Only one person smelled like vanilla and cherries. Only one person could 
make her feel all fluffy inside from a simple hug. And only one person 
whose presence alone could make her mind shut down instantly.

&quot;Hey, Hotaru.&quot;

The girl pulled back and their eyes met. For once, Rei&#39;s were calm and 
peaceful while Hotaru&#39;s were an explosion of emotions.

&quot;You were great.&quot;

That single sentence made up for the embarrassment of having to go to 
Kajiura-san. She couldn&#39;t believe the way those violet eyes twinkled 
with adoration or the way those pretty lips smiled for her. For her.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

&quot;You really were quite spectacular.&quot;

Rei&#39;s attention turned to the quiet brunette smiling at her. Sara 
exclaimed her agreement enthusiastically at Hikari&#39;s side. Megumi 
reluctantly nodded and Henry just smiled. Normally, Rei would be annoyed 
at someone like Megumi but since she was only concerned for Hotaru, 
she&#39;d let it slide.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Hotaru stood by Rei&#39;s side as the miko smiled. She was so beautiful when 
she was relaxed...

&quot;Let&#39;s go ride the Ferris wheel!&quot;

Everyone turned to the handsome man who had remained silent for most of 
the night. They then turned to the ride in question, which was quite the 
sight to behold with its array of glowing lights. Somehow they all 
understood Henry&#39;s desire to go on, the night sky creating the perfect 
contrast against the bright lights.

&quot;Let&#39;s,&quot; was all Rei said.

As the group walked toward the Ferris wheel, Hotaru stayed by her fellow 
senshi. Occasionally, she&#39;d take a peek at the beautiful face, but 
remained quiet for the most part.

Her mind still spun from the events of the day. Actually, the past hour 
to be honest.

Seeing Rei stand there, competing to win the necklace for her awakened 
the hope she thought she had subdued. The miko did it not to make Usagi 
happy, not for Minako and not because it was the right thing to do, but 
for her. Just to make her happy and for no other reason.

It was possible, of course, that the miko wanted it for herself. After 
all, Rei loved fashion almost as much as Minako. Damn, she was getting 
ahead of herself, but the joy refused to be suppressed and the warm 
feeling refused to be banished. Though that was fine since she didn&#39;t 
want them to be gone, she wanted them to stay with her always.

When they stood on line for tickets, Megumi realized that there was room 
for four people per cabin. So that meant they couldn&#39;t all be together. 
She and Henry would be with Hotaru and Rei to make sure the miko kept 
her hands off of her friend.

Sara elbowed Henry and proceeded to explain, in a hushed whisper, to the 
tall youth what Megumi was planning. Thank god the protective brunette&#39;s 
boyfriend was more reasonable and logical than she was.

Megumi snapped from her thoughts of killing the older woman when Henry&#39;s 
familiar arms wrapped around her waist. She suppressed a moan when he 
nuzzled her neck.

&quot;Finally, a chance to be alone.&quot;

The brunette felt her knees go weak. He was right, a chance to be alone. 
But Hotaru-

She felt her boyfriend&#39;s lips place a soft kiss on her neck.

Eh... Hikari and Sara could watch Hino.

Hotaru sat across from Rei as the cabin began to rise from the ground. 
She tried to calm her nerves, not knowing exactly why she was anxious at 
all.

Rei stared at the girl across from her. She looked marvelous in that 
kimono. As they rose higher, she could see the entire city of Tokyo with 
its tall skyscrapers and millions of lights behind Hotaru. They gave the 
shorter girl a heavenly, golden glow and her hair melted into the dark 
blue tapestry of the sky and the stars seemed to twinkle in her silky 
locks...

Hotaru turned her attention from the beautiful view to look at the woman 
with her. The nervousness disappeared and left behind a tranquility that 
comforted her confused mind and soothed her hammering heart.

Rei leaned forward, eyes focusing on Hotaru&#39;s face and the city lights 
that seemed to blend into one giant yellow orb. There was nothing else, 
there would never be anything else.

The college student blushed softly when the miko leaned forward. Her 
closeness, her mouth and the gentle look in her eyes caused both 
excitement to run rampant in her veins and peace to course through her 
body. Was love always such a contradiction? Or was it just her?

The miko licked her lips as she took out the necklace from the small 
box. Hotaru&#39;s eyes left hers for a brief second to gaze at the prize Rei 
earned and the warm, fuzzy feeling returned.

Rei watched the emotions flicker in the purples orbs she gazed into as 
they stared at the necklace in her hands. Those captivating eyes 
abruptly met hers, and the world melted away.

Hotaru opened herself to the miko completely, letting her see her 
gratitude and appreciation. Rei opened her mouth to say &quot;You&#39;re welcome&quot; 
when she saw it... Hotaru&#39;s limitless love for her. The college student 
loved her, regardless of who she was and what she&#39;s done.

At that moment, Rei was on top of the world.

Violet eyes never blinked as the archer unclasped the chain. Their eyes 
never left one another as skilled hands brushed Hotaru&#39;s silky skin. The 
college student never shivered, not wanting to destroy the moment. Once 
the necklace was securely around the younger woman&#39;s neck, Rei let her 
fingers release the chain.

Hotaru felt the weight and yearned to look down, but she couldn&#39;t break 
the gaze. Not now... and maybe not ever.

Rei&#39;s finger caressed the necklace and the silky skin, starting from the 
back of her companion&#39;s neck. As her finger approached the two rings, 
she tore her eyes away from the intense violet eyes to look at them. 
Entranced, she caressed the flawless metal.

Hotaru&#39;s breathing hitched as she felt Rei&#39;s touch through the silk of 
the kimono. She watched the gentle and loving expression on the miko&#39;s 
face in amazement, the small smile that told her exactly what her love 
felt. The pride in the piercing eyes for having placed the chain around 
her neck, the happiness and the satisfaction she saw caused her to lean 
forward unconsciously.

Rei looked up at the movement, feeling the inspecting gaze. Her smile 
grew at the sight of the bright eyes that awaited her. She didn&#39;t know 
anyone&#39;s eyes could shine so bright, but she did now.

They stayed like that for what seemed like eternity, eyes meeting, 
basking in the silence and the calm that surrounded them both. Neither 
of them moved to kiss the other, neither spoke nor did they profess 
their feelings. All they needed was the beating of their hearts, the 
peace that engulfed them and their eyes, which spoke volumes more than 
words ever could.
Hotaru and Rei were still silent when the cabin door opened and four 
pairs of curious eyes studied them intently. The miko stepped out first, 
offering her hand to help her companion out. Megumi&#39;s eyes darted from 
the touching scene to the necklace around her friend&#39;s neck. The other 
three followed her gaze and gawked. So, Rei did give it to Hotaru.

&quot;Hotaru, the necklace looks wonderful on you,&quot; Hikari complimented 
quietly.

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sara added as she grinned, &quot;I&#39;m jealous.&quot;

To everyone&#39;s amusement, Hikari blushed slightly, looking a bit 
distracted. Rei smiled softly, touching Sara on the shoulder.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Hikari would gladly win a teddy bear for you.&quot;

The brunette&#39;s eyes widened, and she was about to protest when the 
blonde turned to her with the most adorable brown eyes she&#39;d ever seen. 
The tall woman felt her insides melt.

&quot;Of course, Sara-chan.&quot;

As the college student jumped up and down, Hikari turned to glare at the 
smiling miko.

&quot;Rei-san, I&#39;m horrible at these games!&quot;

The older woman just smiled, ignoring the fact that the glare worsened.

&quot;I have a game you&#39;ll be great at.&quot;

Hikari sat in front of an arcade style piano, blushing like mad. She had 
no idea how Rei knew she played, but she wished the miko didn&#39;t.

&quot;Hikari,&quot; Rei whispered in her ear, &quot;you&#145;ll be fine. These songs are 
easy and your fellow contestants don&#39;t look like they&#39;re experts.&quot;

The brunette looked down the line of seats and keyboards. This was very 
much like those games where you fire the water gun at the spinning 
target, but for piano playing. There were six kids, five teenagers but 
most of them looked like airheads. Then there was this guy that seemed a 
bit older than her who looked like competition. Maybe if she left now...

&quot;Thanks, Hikari.&quot;

The cheerful voice and arms around her neck appeared out of nowhere, 
destroying the idea. She could feel the warmth radiating from Sara&#39;s 
body, sending her into a state of complete bliss.

&quot;Everyone ready?&quot;

At the sound of the carnival worker&#39;s voice, Sara stepped back and 
Hikari gulped. This was it.

&quot;On your mark, get set... PLAY!&quot;

The notes flashed across the screen as Hikari&#39;s fingers flew across the 
keys. Unfortunately, it wasn&#39;t as easy as Rei had predicted, but then 
again, Hikari had been playing since she was a toddler so she kept up 
with ease. By the mumbled curses around her, her opponents weren&#39;t 
fairing as well.

At the end of the minute, Hikari leaned back. Thank god it was over! But 
nervousness engulfed her. What if she didn&#39;t win Sara that giant teddy 
bear?

&quot;And the winner is... number eight!&quot;

The scream and the warm arms that reappeared around her neck told her 
that she had won. Sara didn&#39;t move away, an act that the brunette was 
very thankful for. It felt right, with her crush&#39;s arms around her.

Crush. There, she&#39;d said finally said it. Finally admitted it. She had a 
crush on Sara.

&quot;Which bear would you like, Miss?&quot;

Hikari looked at the Sara. Their cheeks touched and she felt the 
blonde&#39;s lips brush against her skin, sending shivers down her spine.

&quot;Which one would you like, Sara-chan?&quot;

The shorter girl stood, releasing her hold on her friend. The brunette 
sighed softly. It was good while it lasted.

&quot;That one.&quot;

Hikari didn&#39;t look up as she stood. She was sure Sara had chosen the 
black one with the purple bow. That was just the way the blonde was. 
Black like Hotaru&#39;s hair and purple like her eyes.

Sara felt hurt when Hikari walked towards the others without saying 
anything to her. Was she tired of dealing with the bubbly side of her?

With a soft sigh, she walked back to everyone. She didn&#39;t know what was 
up with herself tonight. Something about being at the festival, the 
lights, the Ferris wheel ride or maybe being with everyone. It brought 
out the innocent side of her that the others rarely saw. She was always 
the cheerful, perverted and blonde, but she was far from innocent.

&quot;Come on, Sara,&quot; Hotaru called. &quot;We&#39;re getting ready to leave.&quot;

&quot;Already?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, Hikari wants to go home.&quot;

The comment brought another wave of hurt through the girl. They were 
having fun. So, why would the brunette want to go home? Was it because 
she&#39;s been hanging onto her all night?

Rei opened the car window as she drove. Soft music played in the 
background as she snuck a glance at the beauty sitting in the 
passenger&#39;s side.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Hotaru whispered, &quot;do you think something upset Hikari?&quot;

The question brought the miko&#39;s thoughts back to the brunette and the 
blonde she liked. Something was definitely off.

&quot;Yeah, Sara as well.&quot;

&quot;What do you think it is?&quot;

&quot;Well, Sara was probably bothered by how Hikari was acting.&quot;

&quot;Why was Hikari acting like that?&quot;

Rei sighed as she stopped at the red light. She debated whether to be 
honest or not.

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Rei, if you know something...&quot;

The pleading look in Hotaru&#39;s eyes basically destroyed any chance that 
she&#39;d do the latter. She just wasn&#39;t sure how Hotaru would take it.

&quot;Hikari thinks she doesn&#39;t have a chance with Sara.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Hotaru knew there was more. Rei wouldn&#39;t hesitate so much if it was just 
that.

&quot;And... she knows Sara has a crush on you.&quot;

Violet eyes blinked once... twice... thrice... What! Sara had a crush on 
her? Oh... dear... lord!

Rei couldn&#39;t help but smile bitterly. She loved Minako so much it made 
her miss Hotaru&#39;s love for her. Meanwhile, Hotaru loved her and was 
oblivious to Sara&#39;s crush on her. Ironic, wasn&#39;t it?

&quot;How... how do you know?&quot;

Lavender eyes gazed sympathetically at the shocked girl. It&#39;s hard when 
you first find out that someone likes you, especially someone close to 
you. She should know...

&quot;It&#39;s in her eyes.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot;

Hotaru looked out the window, mind reeling from the news. Sara, blonde, 
beautiful and sexy Sara liked her.

&quot;What should I do?&quot;

&quot;Nothing.&quot;

The miko ignored the look of shock on her companion&#39;s face. She met the 
younger senshi&#39;s eyes with her own for a second, displaying her sympathy 
in the gaze.

&quot;If you get involved in this, it&#39;ll get even more complex.&quot;

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;Things happen for a reason, Hotaru. Even when something happens that 
doesn&#39;t seem to have a purpose, it always does in the end. Don&#39;t rush 
into this thinking you have to save them both. Let them save 
themselves.&quot;

Hotaru felt as if the words were a slap in the face. Don&#39;t go rushing 
into someone&#39;s life thinking you can save them. That was in essence what 
she tried to do. But Rei saved her first, that was the difference here.

Did Rei not want to be saved? Not by her, at least?

Rei found herself gripping the steering wheel tighter and tighter. 
Everything happens for a reason. That&#39;s it Hino, give her advice you 
yourself never listened to. Everything happens for a reason.

All right, let&#39;s put that to the test.

Her mother died when she was young so that she could be independent. 
Acceptable, kind of, at least.

Her father left her so she could live with her Grandpa at the shrine. 
And because she was a miko, she was more in tuned with the supernatural 
and could help fight the forces of evil better. Once again, she didn&#39;t 
like it, but it was acceptable.

She fell in love with Usagi to awaken her frozen heart. Acceptable.

Usagi didn&#39;t love her back so that Minako could come into her life and 
bring her to new levels of happiness. Easy one.

Minako left her because...

What was the reason for that?

From the corner of her eyes, Rei looked over at the girl sitting beside 
her and her features softened.

Hotaru&#39;s lips formed a slight pout as she tried to listen to the miko&#39;s 
advice. Her long lashes brushed against her pale cheeks as her beautiful 
eyes stayed half-closed. Rei wanted to reach over and run her fingers 
through the silky hair Hotaru had let down, which now brushed against 
her cheeks.

Rei slammed on the breaks, sending the car, herself and Hotaru jerking 
forward. The college student let out a soft yelp as Rei was snapped from 
her thoughts.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; the miko answer half-heartedly as she started driving again.

Was that it? Was Hotaru the reason that Minako left her? So that the 
college student could find her way into her heart?

Well, Hotaru has always been in Rei&#39;s heart. They were friends and the 
miko used to see the girl as a sort of daughter. And now...

Now she was something more. Someone that made Rei&#39;s heart do crazy 
things that only Usagi made it do. She was someone that the miko 
trusted, in ways that she trusted only Minako. And Hotaru was there when 
she needed her. She offered and showed her love when everyone else was 
tired of doing so.

Rei looked at Hotaru discretely, managing to keep her eyes somewhat on 
the road. The most unlikely woman has broken her shields.

Was that it?

Rei opened the apartment doors and let Hotaru in first. The college 
student took off her shoes and quickly entered her room to change. The 
miko did the same, reemerging in sweats and a tank.

&quot;Rei, are you going to shower?&quot;

And there she stood, dressed in a pair of cut off sweats and an oversize 
T-shirt. Her hair was still down, raven locks teasing her red cheeks and 
neck. Pink lips were parted slightly as Hotaru cocked her head to one 
side, an incredibly innocent expression on her face. Dark eyes studied 
the miko, waiting patiently for an answer.

Waiting patiently for an answer.

Waiting patiently for an answer...

Oh! That would be her turn.

&quot;Ummm... no, I&#39;m too tired.&quot;

Hotaru paused and seemed to contemplate the idea herself. To shower, or 
not to shower, that was the question. She certainly didn&#39;t have the 
energy. But she didn&#39;t want to offend Rei with her smell either.

&quot;Take one tomorrow,&quot; the miko drawled as she walked over to the dining 
table and sat down.

&quot;Good idea.&quot;

The comment caused a smile to appear on both their faces as the college 
student plopped down on the couch. Rei looked up at the stars, watching 
them twinkle against the dark blue velvet of the night sky. She closed 
her eyes for a second, remembering how it felt to stand on the moon in 
her past life and look out at the universe, uninhibited by the Earth&#39;s 
atmosphere.

The feeling of being surrounded by infinite burning stars, each lighting 
the cold and dark universe. Even if you couldn&#39;t feel it, heat radiated 
from all of them, engulfing her in a world of warmth and color.

Her mother told her once that she was a star. Hot with an untamable 
fire, her spirit strong and blinding once she set her mind to something. 
A star was just itself, neither evil nor good. But it was how the people 
viewed it that made it one or the other. So she wasn&#39;t good or evil, 
nice or snobby. It was the way that people chose to view her that made 
her either one thing or another.

How wrong her mother was.

Warmth enveloped her as silky skin brushed against her own while a pair 
of arms wrapped around her neck, hugging her from behind. Lavender eyes 
opened but didn&#39;t look at her companion since she felt their cheeks 
press together.

&quot;Hmm...?&quot;

&quot;I just thought you looked like you were in deep thought.&quot;

Rei smiled, leaning back into the embrace.

&quot;I was.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Hotaru whispered, her breath tickling Rei like invisible 
fingers on her skin. &quot;What about?&quot;

The miko looked up at the glass ceiling and leaned her head back against 
her friend&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;The stars.&quot;

The college student mimicked her. It was such a clear night, the 
crescent moon shining brightly.

&quot;They&#39;re beautiful.&quot;

&quot;They always are.&quot;

Hotaru smiled at Rei&#39;s answer, leaning her head against the miko&#39;s. The 
businesswoman closed her eyes, relishing the contact.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

Hotaru took the miko&#39;s hand and placed in it the necklace. Lavender eyes 
met violet in confusion.

&quot;I don&#39;t deserve it.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

The college student stood, walking away quickly. The chair made a shrill 
sound when Rei hastily stood, pushing it back.

&quot;Give it to someone special.&quot;

&quot;But you are special.&quot;

Hotaru turned, eyes meeting with Rei&#39;s. They were across the room from 
one another, yet closer than they&#39;ve ever been. Rei&#39;s heated whisper 
held both in place, one from shock and the other in disbelief at voicing 
her thoughts. But she had already said it, without thinking first, true, 
but that didn&#39;t mean she was lying. She wasn&#39;t.

&quot;Rei-&quot;

&quot;Hotaru,&quot; the miko interrupted firmly. Normally, she would approach her 
guest but she realized that moving now was impossible.

&quot;I won this for you.&quot;

The statement transported the younger girl to a new level of bliss. 
There. It was out. It had been done for her. Thank the gods.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t have entered if I hadn&#39;t found out you wanted it. Sure, it&#39;s 
pretty, but I haven&#39;t entered an archery contest in seven years.&quot;

The confession caused Hotaru to float even higher in her newly found 
heaven. But the hesitation in the miko&#39;s voice kept her grounded.

&quot;So, when you tell me to let someone special have it, you don&#39;t know 
that&#39;s already true.&quot;

Rei swallowed. She had to do it now. Any longer and she&#39;d hide, letting 
the courage fade.

&quot;You are special to me, more than you thought... more than I thought.&quot;

That&#39;s it, Hotaru could have died then and there, and she would have 
done so as the happiest person in the world. She was special to Rei. 
She, Hotaru Tomoe, little nobody, was a somebody to Rei Hino.

&quot;So, this is for you. This...&quot; lavender eyes traveled to the necklace in 
her hand. &quot;This is my way of saying &#39;thank you.&#39; Because I can&#39;t say it 
any other way.&quot;

Rei brought her eyes back up to meet Hotaru&#39;s. The emotions swimming in 
both were enough to drown them.

&quot;This belongs to you.&quot;

The miko placed the necklace on the table and walked out the room. 
Hotaru stood still for a moment, trying to grasp what it all meant. She 
approached the table and picked up the necklace, fingering the rings as 
she smiled.

It didn&#39;t matter what it all meant. Only that it was.</pre>
