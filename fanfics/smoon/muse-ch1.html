<h1>Muse (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Makoto kicked the door closed behind her and laid the heavy grocery 
bags down on the counter. She stepped into the kitchen, grabbed a 
towel, ran it under cold water, and wiped the sweat from her face and 
arms. Although the temperature has fallen in the last hour the air was 
still thick and humid. The oppressive heat of a summer day in the city 
filled her small apartment, sucking the oxygen from the rooms.

Quickly, she put her groceries away, then moved into the living area. 
She could feel the thunderstorm coming, she knew it would break the 
heat, and she could hardly wait. She hated the clinging, moist air. It 
smothered her and made it hard to breathe. She glanced out the window 
and saw gray-green clouds sliding across the sky, massing to form a 
livid, darkening wall. Dusk was falling prematurely, and her apartment 
was getting dim. Not bothering to turn on the light, she stepped to 
the window and lifted the sash.

Makoto stuck her head out the window and sniffed the air. Ozone, 
exhaust, the Chinese restaurant below her apartment and dust. The 
smells of home. But there was an indefinable scent, a whiff of 
something cool and wet that attracted her attention. Glancing up at 
the greying sky, she sensed the storm that was soon to come. She left 
the window open, walked back into the kitchen, then stared at the 
range. She contemplated a cup of tea, eventually deciding against it. 
It was just too hot. Her body was once again sticky with sweat. She 
considered a shower, but admitted to herself that she was just too 
lazy to do anything. She stood in the middle of the room, allowing the 
day&#146;s tension to flow from her limbs, as the gloom outside thickened.

A cold breeze wafted in through the window, bringing with it the smell 
of loamy earth and the mountains. Makoto breathed in the scent and 
sighed happily. Another current came in, this one carrying the scent 
of a powerful storm with it. The cool air brushed across her skin and 
gave her goose bumps. She turned back to the window and noticed how 
quickly the sky was darkening. Sitting down on a cushion by the 
window, she watched as the clouds billowed and roiled over the city. 
The temperature was still falling and she could feel her skin turn to 
gooseflesh with the touch of the cold wet air. She imagined the 
distant rumble of the storm to be the sound of hooves. There would be 
a chariot in the middle of the tempest, carrying a Prince clad in grey 
armor, and wielding the lightning as his spear. She closed her eyes 
and dreamed of this prince, her lover who would be carried to her on 
the wings of this storm.

A blast of wind gusted in through the window and Makoto leaned into 
it, letting it buffet her. She could feel her nipples get hard against 
the cloth of her T-shirt and one hand idly brushed across her breast. 
She closed her eyes and imagined her Prince&#146;s hand running lightly up 
her breast, then sliding down, caressing the nipple. It felt lovely. 
She moaned a little, letting the sound rumble in her chest like 
distant thunder.

The storm was breaking now and she could hear the large raindrops 
splattering as they hit the street, the window, the people below. She 
watched figures scurrying as the wind increased, trying to avoid the 
oncoming torrent. The sweat was now dry upon her skin and the cold air 
seemed to have fingers of its own, teasing and caressing her.

Stepping back from the window, hidden in the apartment&#146;s darkness, 
Makoto removed her T-shirt and bra, and let the cold air harden her 
all over again. She touched herself, rolling her nipples between her 
fingers, letting her body feel the rhythm of the rain as it beat a 
staccato pattern into the windows and roof of her building. Slowly she 
began to move to the rhythm, letting her hips sway to the percussion 
of the storm. When the first lightning bolt came she felt it run down 
her spine to her very core. The thunder that rattled the apartment 
building made her sigh. Her Prince had arrived. She could feel warmth 
building between her thighs with every howl and rush of the wind.

The rain was coming down hard now and Makoto moved closer to the 
window again, to feel the water as it splashed against the pane, cold 
and sharp like fingertips drumming upon her body. Another lightning 
strike and she threw her head back in pleasure. One hand slid down 
into her shorts, playing in the short hair and swiftly moistening 
cleft. Her moans were louder now, syncopated by the lightning and 
thunder.

Makoto stripped off her shorts and underwear and lay under the window, 
the rain striking her with red-hot intensity. She trailed one hand 
through her lower lips, and with the other, she thrust two fingers 
into herself, just as a bolt of lightning sizzled through the air. 
When the thunder cracked, she thrust hard into herself, feeling her 
body respond to the squall. 

&quot;Again.&quot; she whispered to her storm lover, and again the lightning 
rent the air. She yelped as she thrust deeply into herself, playing 
one hand back and forth across her clit. The thunder shook her to her 
very core. One more and she would come. At long last the lighting 
came, the sizzle and spark of it practically deafening and blinding 
her at once. When the thunder rang out not even a second later, it 
masked the sound of her cries, as she shook and rocked in a building 
shuddering under the impact of fierce nature.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ami sat back from her computer keyboard and stretched luxuriously, her 
arms over her head. She straightened in her seat and touched her 
fingers once again to the keyboard, but paused when the soft sound of 
bare feet on the floor made her look up with a smile.

&quot;Are you almost done?&quot; Makoto&#146;s voice was soft and rough from sleep. 
She put her hands on Ami&#146;s neck and began to massage it. Ami closed 
her eyes and reveled in the feeling of strong thumbs that knew all her 
pressure points.

&quot;Almost.&quot; she responded belatedly.

&quot;It&#39;s almost 1 AM, you know.&quot; Makoto leaned down and read the words on 
the monitor. &quot;It always seems disconcerting, reading my own name up 
there, watching myself do such ecchi things. Especially when you post 
them on the Internet.&quot;

&quot;I always change the name before I post them. But I know it&#39;s you.&quot; 
Ami turned around and smiled into Makoto&#146;s sparkling green eyes. Ami 
reached up to draw Makoto closer. &quot;You&#146;re my inspiration - my Muse.&quot; 
she kissed Makoto softly and the tall girl responded with a surprising 
passion. Surprising to anyone who didn&#146;t know her well, that is. Ami 
was no longer surprised at the depths and heights to which Makoto&#146;s 
passion and intensity could travel.

Their kiss lingered and deepened. Makoto pulled away, drawing Ami up 
with her.

&quot;Come to bed.&quot; she purred suggestively. Ami needed no second urging 
and quickly saved the story and shut down the program. As she wrapped 
her robe about her more tightly, she felt something largish and stiff 
in the pocket. She reached in and pulled out a pair of leather cuffs, 
lined with fleece. She held them up with a grin. 

&quot;Whose turn is it this time?&quot;

Makoto turned around and glanced back, then grinned widely. &quot;Yours, I 
think.&quot;

Ami considered. &quot;On one condition.&quot;

&quot;Mmmm?&quot;

&quot;You wear your leather jacket.&quot;

Makoto grinned even harder as Ami sidled up to her with a soft growl. 
She leaned up to whisper in her lover&#146;s ear. &quot;Don&#146;t bother with the 
blouse this time.&quot;

Makoto swallowed hard and nodded. She stopped by the door to the 
bathroom. &quot;You go in...I&#146;ll follow in a few.&quot; and she disappeared into 
the bathroom, closing the door after her.

Ami sat on their bed for a little while, pondering how she would be 
best presented tonight. Completely or partially naked? Dressed? In 
what? She decided on the school fuku that she had kept, even though 
they were both several years out of high school. There was something 
exciting about playing the good girl to Makoto&#146;s tough...

When the door opened, Ami had arranged herself neatly on the bed, a 
book laid out on her lap, much as she had been through all her early 
years of school, when books were her only true friends. She did not 
look up as Makoto approached her,. She didn&#146;t move, in fact, until a 
breath in her ear announced the presence of someone next to her. Very 
close. Too close. 

Ami could feel the hair on her neck rise as Makoto slid her mouth 
close to Ami&#146;s ear.

&quot;Whatcha reading?&quot; Makoto put on a &quot;tough&quot; accent, that made Ami want 
to giggle, but she ignored this instinct and simply closed the book, 
gazing up at the taller girl.

&quot;Harrison&#146;s Principles and Practice of Internal Medicine.&quot; Ami 
couldn&#146;t help smirking a bit as Makoto&#146;s blank gaze told her she had 
been thrown for a loop by this title. Makoto took Ami&#146;s hand in hers 
and turned the book over to see the cover. &quot;Harrison&#146;s Principles and 
Practice of Internal Medicine&quot; met her bewildered gaze. Ami couldn&#146;t 
help it, she laughed. She had just purchased the book this afternoon 
for Med school and she hadn&#146;t yet shown it to Makoto. Makoto scowled 
at the book and took it firmly out of Ami&#146;s hands, placing it behind 
her on the bed.

&quot;Seems like an awful lot of words. I think you might need a break.&quot; 
Makoto&#39;s voice was low and suggestive and Ami&#146;s skin prickled. 

&quot;Oh, no, &quot; she insisted, &quot;I have a lot of reading to do.&quot; Ami reached 
for the book, but Makoto&#146;s grip stalled her as she leaned close to the 
shorter girl. Ami turned away, but Makoto&#146;s other hand drew Ami&#146;s face 
back towards her own. Ami could smell Makoto&#146;s scent mixed with 
leather, and it was all she could do to resist the urge to kiss her.

Makoto sat down next to Ami and Ami could see the leather jacket 
belted and zippered about one third of the way up. Ami&#146;s eyes fixed on 
the cleavage that the jacket showed to good advantage. It was Makoto&#146;s 
turn to smirk. &quot;You like medicine, huh? Maybe you&#146;d like to play 
doctor.&quot;

Ami cleared her throat, but kept her eyes on Makoto&#146;s chest. &quot;Maybe a 
short break would be okay....&quot; Her voice cut out as Makoto leaned 
close, almost touching Ami&#146;s lips.

&quot;You know what they say, Doc, &quot;Makoto teased, &quot;All work and no play 
makes Ami a dull girl.&quot;

&quot;You sound like Minako...&quot; Ami&#146;s protest stopped abruptly as Makoto 
lowered her lips to Ami&#146;s. Ami fought briefly then, in a gesture of 
capitulation, slid her arms around her lover&#146;s neck and returned the 
kiss passionately. Makoto slipped her arms under Ami&#146;s blouse, 
stroking the skin underneath. Ami moaned into Makoto&#146;s mouth as hands 
caressed her back.

Ami pulled back and buried her face in Makoto&#146;s chest, kissing the 
tantalizing cleavage the jacket revealed. She pulled the zipper down 
further and nipped at the skin she uncovered. Just as the jacket 
parted and Makoto lifted one breast to tease Ami, the blue-haired girl 
pulled back, turning her face away, ignoring the heat in her cheeks, 
and between her legs.

&quot;Really, I have to study. I can&#146;t do this now.&quot; Ami&#146;s voice was weak, 
almost as if she needed to convince herself of her &quot;real&quot; purpose. It 
was all too easy to slip back into this mode of thought. So many years 
study had been her raison d&#146;etre, that it was still almost natural to 
express this conviction, even as her body ached for Makoto.

Makoto growled and grabbed Ami&#146;s hands and bore down upon her, quickly 
cuffing her before she had a chance to resist. Ami found herself flat 
on her back, with Makoto&#146;s solid form above her, as her arms were 
pinned, then the cuffs attached to a hook on the wall by a short 
chain. Ami pulled at the chain, but she was unable to pull herself 
free. She let her body enjoy the mild discomfort of the position, 
testing the chains by pulling at them, and testing Makoto by wriggling 
underneath her. At this, a wolfish smile crossed Makoto&#146;s face and she 
pinned Ami&#146;s legs underneath her own.

Unfastening the jacket completely, Makoto took one breast and fed it 
to Ami, who sucked at it hungrily, moaning into Makoto&#146;s flesh. 

&quot;That&#146;s better. Even geniuses need a break now and then.&quot; Makoto 
laughed huskily and gasped as Ami bit her lightly. Ami&#146;s arms felt 
stretched and her shoulders began to burn. She reveled in the feel as 
her body, fit and strong from years of training, began to push into 
its reserves. The endorphins that flooded into her body made her more 
sensitized. Makoto&#146;s hands left energetic imprints on her skin that 
lingered as they stroked along her stomach and across her chest. When 
Makoto&#146;s fingers brushed Ami&#146;s nipples, Ami strained against her 
bonds, pulling towards the sensation, but Makoto had already pulled 
her hands away. Ami groaned with the loss.

Makoto kissed Ami deeply and slid her hand under Ami&#146;s skirt. Finding 
her naked underneath, Makoto moaned and caressed the inside of Ami&#146;s 
thighs. Ami pulled once again against the cuffs, arching her back, her 
muscles taut, as she begged Makoto to touch her.

Slowly Makoto moved down Ami&#146;s body. Spreading Ami&#146;s legs, she licked 
greedily at Ami&#146;s pussy, sucking on her until Ami&#146;s legs began to 
shake. Ami was babbling now, calling Makoto&#146;s name and those of 
various kami. Makoto smiled as she stroked Ami with her tongue, 
speeding up slowly, almost imperceptibly. With a wail, Ami begged 
Makoto to enter her and the tall girl did, not removing her mouth from 
Ami&#146;s clit. Ami&#146;s climax was sharp and hard as she called to her lover 
to thrust into her more deeply.

As Ami relaxed backwards, blinking her eyes into focus, Makoto crawled 
up her body and laid upon the smaller girl. Looking down into Ami&#146;s 
blue eyes, Makoto grinned. Ami smiled back, and closed her eyes in 
pleasure and exhaustion.


&quot;Have I ever told you how completely unlike my old sempai you are?&quot; 
Makoto giggled - it was an old joke between them.

Ami&#146;s voice was grim, but not unhappy. &quot;Good. The stupid fool had no 
idea what he walked away from.&quot; She sighed. &quot;His loss, my gain.&quot; and 
she kissed Makoto lightly. Ami rattled her chain a bit. &quot;Let me up, 
Mako-chan. My shoulders hurt and if I remember correctly, it&#39;s your 
turn this time...&quot; she grinned. 

&quot;Will you wear the leather jacket?&quot; Makoto pulled the article off, 
draping it over Ami&#146;s body, who wriggled at the feel of the leather. 
Makoto leaned over Ami to detach the cuffs from the hook on the wall. 
She rubbed Ami&#146;s shoulders briefly, then unbuckled the cuffs.

&quot;Of course, but for some reason,&quot; Ami sat up as her arms were 
released, &quot;I never make as convincing a bad girl as you do.&quot; 

Makoto laughed. &quot;You&#146;re bad enough for me.&quot;

Ami smiled and draped her arms around Makoto&#146;s neck. &quot;I&#146;ll take that 
as a compliment.&quot; They kissed gently, lowering themselves slowly to 
the bed.
