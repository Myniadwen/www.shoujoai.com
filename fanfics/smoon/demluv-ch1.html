<h1>Of Demons and Love (part 1 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/byakko.html">Byakko Rei</a><br> </h2>
<pre>  Disclaimers: 
  This is a Sailor Moon fanfic. 
  The main characters belong to Naoko Takeuchi, 
not me. I hope nobody sues me for warping her 
intentions.
  Before reading this piece, I would urge you 
to please read Emporess&#39; &#39;Fall From Grace&#39; 
first. This story was inspired from her effort, 
and I make references to events in her story. 
  Her website is here: 
  www.geocities.com/emporess888/ 
  I wrote this because I wanted my favorite 
Sailor Moon characters to have their own love 
story.
  
-----------------------------------------------

  Usagi stared vacantly out at the gray sky from 
Makoto&#39;s balcony. She contemplated the recent 
changes in her lover. Her mood matched the 
weather and she ached all over from last night&#39;s 
ordeal, especially between her legs. 
  Since his infusion of power from Celeste, 
Mamoru had decided that it was high time he 
started to seriously pursue government and 
politics in preparation for Crystal Tokyo. He 
had taken up a double major and made himself 
scarce. He spent most of his time in the 
university library or at work. 
  Usagi had decided the only way to see him, was 
to go jog with him at 6am and match his 
six-minute pace, or study at the same table in 
the library. 
  Running had never been a problem. After she 
had raced the clock to get to school on time for 
years, she had been encouraged by all her senshi 
to run track in high school. Her record for the 
mile stood unbeaten all four years for Juuban&#39;s 
district. 
  Usagi had never been an early riser, however, 
and consequently she had many &#39;sleepovers&#39; at 
Mamo-chan&#39;s apartment. 
  Since she had turned 18 in June, Mamo-chan 
had consented willingly to share his bed with 
her. His lovemaking of late had become as 
intense, impatient, and as joyless as his 
life... not to mention, painful. She loved him, 
but not this way. She wanted her old comfortable 
Mamo back. 
  When she watched him sleep, she often wondered 
if it had been the new power that had driven him 
to change, Crystal Tokyo, or both. Either 
prospect filled her with dread. For the first 
time in her life she felt the chill of fear. She 
was afraid of... Mamoru.
  She shivered as a gust of early October wind 
blew past her thinly clad body. A storm brewed. 
Laughter brought Usagi&#39;s attention back to the 
living room where Mako, Mina, and Ami compared 
their new teachers&#39; idiosyncrasies while they 
munched on finger vegetables and dip. 
  Fresh air hadn&#39;t helped her sore head. She 
rubbed it and went to join her animated senshi. 
  She smiled at their antics. 
  &quot;I guess I&#39;ll call Rei to see what Grandpa 
made her do to keep her from this meeting. He 
probably made her clean bathroom tiles with a 
toothbrush again.&quot;
  Mako snickered, &quot;Rei calls it discipline, or 
spiritual purification, I think.&quot;
  Mina groaned, &quot;I would go crazy with all the 
mindless tedium she&#39;s expected to do!&quot; 
  Ami rolled her eyes, &quot;You know, Mina, if you 
had the kind of discipline that Rei shows, you 
wouldn&#39;t get your clock cleaned by her so often 
during training sessions! Her focus is what 
makes her such a strong reliable fighter.&quot; 
  Mako grinned, &quot;Not to mention her fabulously 
focused temper,&quot; her arms simulated a volcano 
eruption.
  Usagi gave her a withering look. 
  As Usagi picked up the phone to dial her 
missed friend, the sense of unrest nagged at 
her. 
  &quot;Moshimoshi, Hikawa Jinja!&quot; Grandpa&#39;s strong 
voice boomed. 
  Usagi cringed and held the phone away from 
her ear. The girls giggled as they anticipated 
one of Rei&#39;s patented fast, furious 
tongue-lashes.
  Usagi glared at them. 
  &quot;Um, may I speak to Rei-chan, please?&quot;
  &quot;Rei doesn&#39;t feel well and requests she not be 
disturbed.&quot; Grandpa replied. 
  Usagi&#39;s mouth went dry. Visions of Rei as she 
shoveled snow off the jinja roof suddenly came 
to mind. Rei had used her senshi powers last 
year to melt the snow off quicker behind 
Grandpa&#39;s back. The water left behind had frozen 
right away and Rei was promptly deposited on her 
backside, she had badly sprained her left ankle, 
and had made her an impossibly difficult 
invalid. 
  The senshi had chipped in their help at the 
jinja while Rei recovered. Since Rei was 
frustrated, though, she had made everyone as 
miserable as she felt. 
  Usagi shuddered. 
  &quot;Um, did she hurt herself? Nani?? The... flu? 
Could you please have her call Mako-chan&#39;s or my 
house when she feels better? Hai... konnichiha!&quot; 
she answered, and hung up the phone. That&#39;s 
odd... Rei was fine yesterday.
  &quot;Rei won&#39;t make it today. So, since she called 
this meeting, I will officially cancel it until 
further notice. Unless, of course, any of you 
have some input on our newest enemy. 
  Mina, has Valka spoken any more about what is 
written in the &#39;Scrolls of Toro&#39; or if he has 
figured out who the person is who will control 
the Earth with power mentioned in them? How 
about the one who holds the &#39;Key to the Gates&#39;?&quot;
  She shook her head &#39;no&#39;.
  &quot;Ami, anything from your computer about 
Valka&#39;s boss, Dagon, or why they want the key so 
badly?&quot; Usagi asked.
  &quot;Nothing, and Luna and Artemis haven&#39;t 
either.&quot; 
  Ami looked as tired as Usagi felt. 
  Usagi watched as Ami went to the kitchen and 
returned with a box waxed paper. She tore off 
four pieces and distributed them. 
  Everyone looked at her curiously. 
  Ami smiled. 
  &quot;We are going to make Rei some senbazuru 
(prayer offering for hardship).&quot;
  &quot;Mako, has your boss, Aradia, dropped any 
clues about her role in everything?&quot; Usagi asked 
as she watched her work in amazement.
  &quot;Nope, she&#39;s very tight-lipped about who she 
is and her unusual control over Pluto?&quot; Makoto 
responded.
  Usagi sighed. She had a bad feeling about 
everything.
  &quot;Why don&#39;t all of you go shop for Christmas 
early?&quot; Usagi suggested while she folded slowly 
and carefully. 
  Ami looked less than enthused, &quot;You don&#39;t want 
to go, Usagi?&quot; She asked as she worked quickly. 
  Usagi shook her head. 
  &quot;No, I think I&#39;ll go see if Rei could use 
some, um, help.&quot; She replied in a reserved 
voice.
  &quot;Should we all go?&quot; Mako asked as she 
completed her crane first.
   Usagi grinned, &quot;Grandpa said she wasn&#39;t well. 
Remember what happened the last time she didn&#39;t 
feel well? Or the last time she was in a snit? 
Do you really think it is necessary for all of 
us to get screamed at and thrown out bodily? Why 
don&#39;t I find out what&#39;s up with her, first.&quot; 
  Makoto shrugged.
  &quot;Well, ok. That girl needs to loosen up!&quot; Mako 
said and handed her crane to Ami. Ami&#39;s face 
colored slightly when Makoto&#39;s fingers briefly 
brushed against her own.  
  Makoto smiled, stood up and went to the 
kitchen, and left the box of waxed paper for a 
struggling Mina.
  When she came back she had large thermos in 
her hand. 
  &quot;Here Usagi, take some of my chicken soup to 
her, in case she really is sick, it just needs 
to be heated up. Rei certainly seemed fine 
yesterday at our senshi practice.&quot; 
  Mako said as she patted the ribs on her right 
side, and offered Usagi the large thermos. 
  Usagi grunted, but managed to stuff it into 
her already over-crowded large backpack.
  &quot;I know, Mako... that&#39;s what worries me. 
Thank you for the soup, I&#39;m sure it will be 
appreciated.&quot; Usagi answered in a strained 
voice.
  Makoto leaned her 6&#39;1&quot; frame over Usagi&#39;s 
shoulder and remarked glibly. 
  &quot;You know, most people carry a separate gym 
bag.&quot;
  Usagi muttered something about being late, it 
was easier to run, and it kept her hands free to 
smack smart-aleck friends. 
  Mako backed off in mock fright.
  Mina snarled and threw another waxed paper 
ball accurately into a waste paper basket 
across the room. 
  &quot;Well, I for one hope she&#39;s just in a snit, 
and not hurt... ok, I give up on the senbazuru, 
Ami.&quot;
  Ami smiled at her, while she easily folded 
another piece of waxed paper into an origami 
crane for Mina. Ami strung the four birds 
together on a thread and handed it to Usagi.
  &quot;Please give the senbazuru to Rei for me. I 
hope she is all right.&quot; She turned to Mina then 
and said consolingly, &quot;oh come on, Mina, the 
work we did for Rei at the jinja wasn&#39;t so bad.&quot; 
  Mina grew fangs.
  &quot;No? You wore bandages on your hands for 3 
days, Ami!&quot; Mina&#39;s voice dripped with sarcasm, 
&quot;and I couldn&#39;t see for three days after I 
bagged all the dead leaves you raked! And you 
are right... the work wasn&#39;t nearly as bad as 
Rei herself!&quot;
  Mako tried hard not to laugh, and irritated 
Mina further.
  &quot;Go ahead and laugh, Mako-chan, all you had 
to do was tie a hundred Mikuji papers to a 
stupid leafless cherry tree!&quot;
  Makoto lost it then. She raised her two 
pointer fingers and crossed them in front of 
Mina&#39;s face. 
  &quot;Calm down, girl! Rei didn&#39;t know you were 
allergic to tree leaf molds... and you try to 
tie a knot with cold fingers! At least we didn&#39;t 
have to shovel any more snow.&quot;
  Usagi raised her hand for silence. 
  &quot;Shame on all of you! Rei does the bulk of the 
temple work alone every day, and she was hurt 
while she tried to keep her roof intact. You sit 
and complain over a few days&#39; work at the jinja. 
Maybe if she had help more often, she wouldn&#39;t 
be so crabby. If she needs our help, we&#39;ll give 
it. She&#39;s our sister.&quot;
  Her senshi bowed low to her in unison. 
  &quot;Hai, your majesty.&quot;
  Usagi bowed back and smiled a little at their 
tomfoolery, bid them farewell, and set out for 
the jinja with her heart in her throat.
