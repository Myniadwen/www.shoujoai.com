King Endymion was miserable.

Yes, he was the king of Crystal Tokyo, but being a king didn&#39;t count for 
a whole hell of a lot when you live in a matriarchy. Neo Queen Serenity 
was the one who wore the pants in the family, and everyone knew it. Not 
only could she defeat the likes of Galaxia and Beryl, but with the 
centuries her powers and beauty only increased.

King Endymion? He could throw flowers.

His greatest claim to fame among the Court was that he once defeated a 
youma by delivering an introductory lecture to it on why it was wrong to 
attack a Bar Mitzvah that was so boring, and so bland, that the youma 
took the knife out of the young boy&#39;s congratulatory cake and took its 
own life rather than listen to him anymore. Rabbi Abramowitz and his 
thirteen year old son would surely have thanked him for saving the 
Jewish celebration, but they and the rest of the guests had fallen 
asleep halfway through his speech.

It didn&#39;t help matters any that the king was constantly sticking his 
foot in his mouth.

There was the time when, giving a speech to a group of foreign 
ambassadors from the Middle East, he told them that they were of vital 
importance to both the future of Crystal Tokyo and all of mankind 
because the Middle East kept the Near East and the Far East safely 
separated. Then there was the time a reporter asked him, as King, how he 
planned to help certain poorer families who were slipping through the 
cracks. His suggestion of having men fill in the cracks with cement to 
prevent further injuries to poorer subjects didn&#39;t go well at all.

Then, there was his relationship with his wife. For years now, even 
before the birth of Chibi Usa, it felt as if she were just going through 
the motions with him. She hadn&#39;t loved him in a long time, and he knew 
it. She wanted something, and whatever it was he clearly wasn&#39;t fitting 
the bill. He could see it in her eyes; she yearned for something else, 
but what? He only wish he knew what was wrong.

Feeling depressed, he left his royal palace to go to the next official 
function; a photo op at the International Children&#39;s Science Fair.

------

Mina-chan went into the large shrine to see her friend and the Kingdom&#39;s 
High Priestess, Rei. With her she brought her trusted advisor Artemis.

&quot;It&#39;s about time I had a part in one of these.&quot; the cat mumbled.

&quot;What?&quot; Mina asked.

&quot;Oh nothing.&quot; Artemis said. &quot;Mina, I know you&#39;re trying to cheer her up, 
but don&#39;t you think the &#39;Team Rei&#39; T-shirt is a bit much?&quot;

&quot;Well, I...&quot; she stopped when she heard something a bit disquieting. 
Artemis&#39; ears shot up as he too now heard it. As they got closer, they 
both realized it was the sound of someone crying. Silently the two snuck 
up to the room and looked in.

There, kneeling before the shrine as she wept was Rei, a photo of Neo 
Queen Serenity on the altar.

&quot;Rei.&quot; Mina said as she knelt down by the High Priestess, &quot;Rei, what is 
it? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I... I can&#39;t do it anymore...&quot; she sobbed, &quot;All these long centuries, year 
after year, pretending all I felt for her was friendship, when I... I...&quot;

&quot;Shhh...&quot; Mina whispered as she hugged her friend, &quot;I know how you feel 
about the Queen. Heck, all of us know about it (you&#39;re not all that good 
at hiding it, you know). But there&#39;s no way anything could ever come of 
it, Rei. She&#39;s married, remember? I mean, granted, King Endymion makes 
Dan Quayle look like Albert Einstein, but he is still the King and 
still...&quot;

&quot;I... I know.&quot; Rei whispered as she wiped her eyes. Looking down at her 
wristwatch, she allowed a small gasp to escape.

&quot;Rei, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Mina asked.

&quot;Look at the time.&quot; she said, &quot;We and the rest of the Royals have to 
make an appearance at the Children&#39;s Science Fair. You know how much the 
children look forward to seeing us there each year.&quot;

Mina looked at her own watch and nodded, &quot;Right.&quot; she said, &quot;Come on, 
I&#39;ll give you a ride.&quot;

---At the Science Fair---

The science fair was packed with children from around the world, each 
displaying their own little projects to the judges. Ami was of course 
the host, as she had been for the past three hundred years. By her side 
stood Makoto, and as the two made their appearance the entire room broke 
out into fervent cheering for the two royals. The two had come out 
centuries earlier, and were among the best loved royal couples in 
Crystal Tokyo. Next entered Minako with Artemis and Rei. Again there was 
fervent cheering, but while the love of the subjects did cause Rei to 
crack a grateful smile, it couldn&#39;t lift the shadow of sadness over her 
heart.

Then, to the sounds of trumpets, she entered; Neo Queen Serenity, with 
Chibi Usa by her side. The building practically shook to the deafening 
noise of clapping and screams of the crowd. Rei saw her Queen and froze; 
the Queen seemed to be almost as sad as she was. Neo Serenity turned her 
head to look at the Priestess, and in that moment Rei saw all the 
longing and loneliness she herself felt mirrored in her Queen&#39;s eyes.

As the thunderous applause finally subsided, Endymion came in. After a 
few seconds of silence, the sound of crickets chirping could be heard 
from outside the event center.

&quot;Huh,&quot; the King said as he tugged on his tie, &quot;No respect, no respect at 
all.&quot;

------

&quot;And this is young Sara with her model volcano.&quot; one of the teachers 
present said. The young girl&#39;s eyes lit up with glee at seeing Neo 
Serenity up close like this. As the Queen noticed the child staring wide 
eyed at her wings, she smiled.

&quot;Would you like to touch one of them?&quot; the Queen asked. The child nodded 
as she reached out an enthusiastic hand to feel the soft white feathers 
of the Queen&#39;s right wing.

Endymion frowned; the kid had gotten farther with his wife inside of 
thirty seconds of meeting her than he&#39;d been able to get with her in the 
past three weeks. He was bored of the event and annoyed by the fact 
that, not only was everyone paying more attention to his wife than to 
him, but no one was willing to explain to him why Mina-chan was wearing 
a T-shirt to the event that said &#145;Team Rei.&#39; As he was looking around 
absently, his eyes widened as he saw an exciting-looking exhibit on the 
other side of the event center.

&quot;Wow!&quot; Endymion said with a smile as he came over to look closer, &quot;A 
rocket-powered back pack!&quot;

&quot;Yes King Endymion-sama.&quot; the proud young boy with the glasses said as 
Rei came over, &quot;It took a while to perfect the thrust mechanism, but...&quot;

&quot;ACME?&quot; Rei asked in alarm as she saw the manufacturer&#39;s label on one of 
the parts of the rocket, &quot;I&#39;ve heard of those guys. Isn&#39;t that the 
American company under investigation for using dangerous explosives in 
most of their products and... Endymion, wha... What are you doing?&quot; the 
Priestess asked as the King began strapping the rocket onto his back.

&quot;Relax.&quot; Endymion said, &quot;I&#39;m bored, and it looks like fun. Besides, it 
perfectly safe, right young man?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the boy began, &quot;Actually, I...&quot;

&quot;Wonderful.&quot; Endymion said without listening as he finished mounting it 
onto his back, &quot;Now look Rei, I&#39;m just going to take a quick spin around 
the convention center and back.&quot;

&quot;My King,&quot; Rei said pensively, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;Watch this.&quot; Endymion said as he flicked a switch at the side of the 
rocket. He stuck both hands out in front of him like Superman as the 
rocket began to rumble, expecting to fly safely around the Science Fair. 
Instead, the rocket launched him straight up, breaking the sound barrier 
as it crashed the King through the glass skylight and exploded nine 
seconds later once it reached ten thousand feet.

The Queen, as well as the other royals, rushed over to the stunned 
Priestess and the young boy whose science project had just blown up the 
King.

&quot;What in the hell just happened?&quot; Makoto asked.

&quot;Well,&quot; the young boy with the glasses said nervously, &quot;You see...&quot;

&quot;It was an accident.&quot; Rei said as she came to the aid of the small boy, 
&quot;The King strapped a rocket pack to his back, and...&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot; The Queen said somberly. She turned from the High Priestess of 
the Kingdom to address her subjects, &quot;My people,&quot; she began, &quot;King 
Endymion is dead. With you, I share in your sorrow at the death of the 
King. And, I&#39;m sure you will all understand me when I say he will be 
missed.&quot;

Chibi Usa turned to Luna, &quot;Is she kidding?&quot; the pink-haired youngster 
asked. Luna&#39;s response was to snicker.

&quot;However, there is one silver lining to this tragedy.&quot; The Queen 
continued, &quot;For several years now, centuries even, I&#39;ve been in love 
with another. However, the protocols of Court demanded I stay with the 
King, since a Royal divorce was unthinkable. Now that he is dead, 
however, I do hereby publicly proclaim before the entire Kingdom my love 
for the High Priestess Hino Rei.&quot;

Rei&#39;s jaw dropped, &quot;M... My Queen!&quot; she stuttered out, &quot;Have you taken 
leave of your senses? The subjects would never accept...&quot; her voice was 
drowned out suddenly by loud cheering from all the subjects. Rei was 
taken aback as she looked out at the overjoyed faces of the subjects of 
Crystal Tokyo present.

&quot;You... You&#39;re all happy about this?&quot; Rei asked. She&#39;d been so forlorn for 
so long that she still couldn&#39;t believe that all her dreams were 
suddenly coming true.

&quot;I told you!&quot; Minako shouted from the midst of the crowd, &quot;All of us 
know how you feel about Neo Queen Serenity.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re not that good at hiding it.&quot; one of the students in attendance 
said. The others in the auditorium nodded in agreement to the statement. 
Rei turned to Neo Serenity as tears of joy started to form in her eyes.

&quot;S... Serenity... I...&quot; she was cut off as her Queen took her into her arms 
and kissed her passionately before the assembly, all of who applauded 
their approval. As they separated, Neo Serenity smiled upon her friend, 
fellow Senshi, and now lover.

&quot;Rei-chan,&quot; she cooed, &quot;Wait here my beloved. I have something to do. 
I&#39;ll only be but a moment.&quot; With that she went back over to the boy with 
the glasses whose project had blown up Endymion and pulled him into a 
back room. Alone with him in the room, the Queen smiled broadly.

&quot;Good work Bernie.&quot; she said to the dwarf in the boy&#39;s school uniform 
and glasses, &quot;Here&#39;s the money I promised you for making it look like an 
accident.&quot;

&quot;Sure t&#39;ing yer Highness.&quot; the diminutive hit man said with a smile, &quot;I 
hopes you an&#39; da other lady are real happy t&#39;gether.&quot; he said as he 
snuck out of the building, never to be seen again.

Neo Queen Serenity watched as the door the fake student exited out of 
closed behind him. She then looked out at the audience, smiling as she 
gave a knowing wink before going back out to Rei to begin their new life 
together</pre>
