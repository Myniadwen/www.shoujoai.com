How beautiful you are, my darling! Oh, how beautiful! Your eyes are

verdant.

Song of Solomon, 1:13-16

------

A dental implant is a tiny titanium post inserted surgically into the 
jaw of someone who has lost a tooth. The implant acts as a substitute 
root for the artificial tooth that is then put into the mouth to replace 
the original. The procedure costs quite a bit of money, and 
unfortunately falls under the category of &quot;reconstructive&quot; or &quot;plastic&quot; 
surgery procedures on most dental and health insurance plans, meaning it 
isn&#39;t covered. And of course there&#39;s a waiting list for the procedure, 
even for someone who had one tooth knocked out by a foot to the face and 
another by the contents of a jewelry store being thrown at her.

Luckily, Saito Kihomi was now friends with a world famous racecar driver 
and a sought after concert violinist, both of whom insisted on paying 
for the procedure for her. Also, she was lucky in that she found an 
orthodontist who was a classical music lover. One autographed Kaioh 
Michiru violin CD later, she was in for the procedure. For the first six 
months, she&#39;d be wearing small dentures of the teeth that had been 
knocked out while the post bonded with her upper jawbone. After that, 
the permanent replacement teeth would go in. She was rolling the tip of 
her tongue against the two tiny false teeth, noting how they felt almost 
like the original, as she got on the elevator.

It had been a long day back to school for Kihomi. Between the fight 
she&#39;d had to break up during study hall, the staff meeting after school 
and wearing those damned uncomfortable heels all day she was exhausted. 
Then, of course, there was the incident...

------

She&#39;d seen the Sailor V lunchboxes and pictures growing up, of course. 
She could remember when the other Senshi began to appear, the newspapers 
and TV covering their exploits even as her classmates would argue over 
who was the most powerful or who was the cutest. Today, after her third 
class, she caught a group of girls gathered in a circle around 
something, talking. Walking over, she asked to see what was so 
interesting.

There, on the cover of a magazine, was a grainy picture of her that had 
been taken by a spectator during her fight with Babylon a week and a 
half ago. She was lurching out of the restaurant, surrounded by plaster 
dust and broken glass, holding her shield as she looked across the 
street at the jewelry store. The headline read &quot;New Senshi?&quot;

&quot;Wow.&quot; Kihomi said, &quot;A new Senshi, huh?&quot;

One of the girls spoke up, &quot;Well, they don&#39;t know yet actually, 
Saito-sensei. Apparently the people there at the scene said they saw her 
fighting a naked girl, but the witnesses couldn&#39;t agree on what was 
happening.&quot;

Another chimed in, &quot;Some said it was just a naked woman, while others 
said she was a youma dripping with blood and had a snake&#39;s tongue. Then 
some said she attacked the Senshi, crashing her through a restaurant, 
while others said the Senshi attacked first, sending her through a 
jewelry store window.&quot;

&quot;Couldn&#39;t be much of a Sailor Senshi.&quot; a third girl spoke up, &quot;I mean, 
she ended up running away from the thing, didn&#39;t she? And look at that 
picture; she looks all beat up. You never see Sailor Venus or Sailor 
Jupiter get beat up like that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, really.&quot; The first one chimed in, &quot;What a wuss.&quot;

Kihomi&#39;s right eye began to twitch as she left the group and went back 
to her classroom for her next class.

------

Her elevator door opened, and she wearily stepped out. She just wanted 
to get inside her apartment, take a hot bath, and relax. Then, after a 
nice long soak, maybe get together with Setsuna, and have a romantic 
evening. She held onto her briefcase with one hand while turning the key 
in her lock with the other.

Opening the door, she was in for a surprise.

The apartment was romantically lit up with aromatic candles. They were 
everywhere; on the tables, the counters, and the floor. There was a path 
of rose petals leading to the bedroom. Kihomi began to reach in her 
jacket for her henshin wand, when she remembered that she&#39;d given 
Setsuna a key to her apartment.

&quot;Sets-chan?&quot; the teacher called out as she took her shoes off. As if in 
response, romantic music started playing from the stereo in her bedroom. 
She smiled as she followed the trail of candles to her room, listening 
to the music and inhaling the sweet smelling aromas around her.

There, sitting on a bed covered in rose petals wearing very revealing 
black lingerie, sat Setsuna. Her body was bathed in the candlelight as 
she looked up at Kihomi and began to curl some of her long silken hair 
around her index finger.

&quot;Hello.&quot; The Time Senshi purred, &quot;Long day at the office?&quot;

As Setsuna saw Kihomi unconsciously lick her lips and noted the look in 
her grey eyes, she made a mental note to thank Michiru for the 
suggestion of the candles and rose petals, and Haruka for the use of the 
Barry White CD.

&quot;S... Sets-chan?&quot; Kihomi asked as she began to walk over, &quot;What&#39;s the 
occasion?&quot;

The woman on her bed smiled invitingly, &quot;Kiho, it&#39;s been two weeks today 
since we first met at the mall, remember?&quot;

The teacher smiled back at that. If Setsuna wanted to celebrate a 
two-week anniversary, she wasn&#39;t about to argue. She allowed her eyes to 
wander over her body, noting the way the garters rested on her bare 
thighs, how beautiful and smooth her midriff was, and how her violet 
eyes shone in the candlelight. She came over to the bed and stroked her 
cheek, inhaling her scent, the scent of the petals, and the candles.

Setsuna closed her eyes as she leaned her head in to Kihomi&#39;s hand. She 
felt her beloved sit down on the bed next to her as she was pulled into 
a long, sensual kiss. Neither was in any hurry, and both were relishing 
the intimacy of the moment.

They both fell back gently onto the bed, and Kihomi could feel her lover 
working on the buttons of her blouse. Removing her lips momentarily to 
help her, the teacher could feel her love&#39;s breath against her cheek as 
she finished unbuttoning the top two buttons. Finally getting the 
article of clothing off, she once again brought her lips to Setsuna&#39;s.

As the Time Senshi&#39;s hand began to travel down her back, Kihomi broke 
the kiss and brought her lips to her ear.

&quot;Sets-chan.&quot; she whispered, &quot;I love you.&quot;

Setsuna hugged her tighter, &quot;I know.&quot; she said, rubbing her cheek up 
against Kihomi&#39;s, &quot;I know. I love you too.&quot;

Some time later, both women fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms.

---The Next Evening---

Kihomi scooted over when her love came to sit down next to her on the 
couch, a bowl of popcorn in the Time Senshi&#39;s hands. Raising her left 
arm up, she let Setsuna snuggle up next to her on the couch, resting her 
arm back down on her shoulders.

&quot;So, what did I miss?&quot; the Time Senshi asked as she lay her head on 
Kihomi&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry; we&#39;re still in episode two. The two you haven&#39;t seen yet 
will be coming up next.&quot;

&quot;What did you say this show was called?&quot; Michiru asked. She was sitting 
in the love seat with Haruka to the left of Setsuna and Kihomi, while 
Hotaru was in the single seat to the right.

&quot;It&#39;s called &#145;Dr. Who.&#39;&quot; Setsuna answered as Kihomi fed her a popped 
kernel, &quot;Kiho-chan showed it to me.&quot;

&quot;I like it.&quot; Hotaru said, adding, &quot;Especially the way he pretends he&#39;s 
foolish in order to take his enemies off their guard.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Haruka chimed in, &quot;And that Romana&#39;s kind of cute too. Ouch!&quot; 
the blond cried out as Michiru pinched her. &quot;That&#39;s it; I&#39;m getting up 
to get a beer. Hey Mick,&quot; she said, addressing Kihomi, &quot;You want one 
too?&quot;

The teacher smirked. Ever since the fight she&#39;d had with the demon 
Babylon, Haruka had given her the nickname Mick after a hardcore 
wrestler named Mick Foley. Apparently, the man&#39;s greatest claim to fame 
was that he got smashed through tables on a routine basis and lost some 
of his teeth once in a steel cage match.

&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll have one.&quot; she answered, adding with a smile, &quot;But if you 
keep calling me Mick, I&#39;m going to take a steel chair to the back of 
your skull.&quot;

&quot;Promises, promises.&quot; Haruka said as she left the room. The teacher 
turned her attention back to Setsuna, feeding her another kernel as she 
kissed her on her cheek. Her love swallowed the kernel, then kissed her 
lightly on the lips. They both turned their attention back to the show, 
when the phone rang. They heard Haruka&#39;s voice faintly in the other room 
answering, then the blond came back in the room.

&quot;Who was that?&quot; Setsuna asked, pulling her head off Kihomi&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Usagi.&quot; Haruka answered as she passed Kihomi a cold beer, &quot;She and the 
others are coming over.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;Is everything okay?&quot;

&quot;Everything&#39;s fine.&quot; The blond answered with a smile, &quot;It seems that Ami 
and Makoto have something they want to share, and they want everyone 
present when they do it.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s face lit up, &quot;Good for them.&quot; she whispered.

Kihomi, not having been around her new friends long enough to have 
picked up on the worst kept secret among the Senshi, was unaware of why 
the other women in the room looked so happy all of a sudden.

&quot;What?&quot; she asked, &quot;What am I missing?&quot;

Haruka smiled as she set her beer bottle down, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mick; 
you&#39;ll find out.&quot;

Kihomi laughed as she shook her fist at the blond, &quot;Doh, if I wasn&#39;t 
holding Sets-chan...&quot; she joked.

&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; the racecar driver answered with a smirk, &quot;Hide behind 
your girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;Children, please.&quot; Michiru chided, &quot;Some of us are trying to watch 
this.&quot;

Hotaru turned from the screen to look at Kihomi, &quot;So, you ready for this 
weekend?&quot;

The teacher fed Setsuna another kernel. This weekend she would begin 
training with the Outers in order to learn how to properly use her 
powers. For the history teacher, whose least favorite subject in school 
was always physical education, the thought of training with Haruka in 
her weight room was a bit daunting. Of course, the thought of getting 
beat up again by a future opponent was enough of an incentive to get her 
over her fears and into the gym.

That, and the fact that the War Senshi was not about to be called a 
&quot;wuss.&quot;

&quot;Ready as I&#39;m ever going to be.&quot; she conceded. &quot;So, how do you like your 
new history teacher?&quot; she asked. Since she was now dating one of 
Hotaru&#39;s parents, it was decided that it would be best if she leave 
Kihomi&#39;s class in order to avoid the appearance of favoritism. Granted, 
the only people who knew right now were the principle and a gay male 
math teacher she confided into, but knowing the way rumors spread in a 
school it was deemed best to make the move now.

&quot;He&#39;s alright, I guess.&quot; Hotaru answered. &quot;By the way, I&#39;ve been 
thinking...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Kihomi asked as she took a sip of her beer, &quot;About what?&quot;

&quot;Well, how to address you of course.&quot; Hotaru answered, &quot;I mean, I 
already have two mamas and one papa. And since you and Setsuna-mama seem 
pretty serious about one another, that means you&#39;re probably going to be 
part of the family for quite awhile.&quot; she said thoughtfully. Suddenly, 
her face lit up, &quot;I&#39;ve got it; Kihomi oba-san (auntie Kihomi).&quot;

The teacher blushed at that; oba-san was a term usually reserved for old 
ladies. Still, she couldn&#39;t very well complain. She was actually quite 
touched that Setsuna&#39;s adopted daughter wanted to now adopt her as her 
aunt.

&quot;Oba-san. I like that.&quot; she said. Just then the doorbell rang. Michiru 
stopped the DVD with the remote as Hotaru opened the door to allow Usagi 
and the other Inners in.

&quot;Kiho-chan.&quot; Usagi said as Minako gave Hotaru a sisterly hug, &quot;How are 
you doing?&quot;

&quot;Fine. Still getting used to everything, I suppose.&quot; she admitted.

&quot;Well don&#39;t worry.&quot; Makoto put in, &quot;We&#39;re all here to help.&quot;

Kihomi smiled warmly at that. Less than a month ago, she was depressed 
over her lack of friends and a social life. Now, she had a girlfriend, a 
new extended family of close friends, and was moonlighting as a Sailor 
Senshi. As Luna and Artemis entered and Rei finished setting her shoes 
to the side of the door, Ami nervously addressed everyone.

&quot;I... um, well, you know me and Makoto have something we want to tell 
you all.&quot; she began, &quot;And we didn&#39;t want to say anything until we knew 
for sure how we both felt, and...&quot;

Makoto walked over and took her hand, &quot;What Ami-chan is trying to say is 
that we&#39;re dating.&quot; she said.

Everyone put on their best surprised act and pretended to be in shock as 
they began congratulating the two of them. Setsuna got up to hug them, 
while Haruka held up her beer bottle.

&quot;A toast.&quot; she declared, &quot;To the happy couple.&quot;

&quot;To the happy couple.&quot; Everyone else cheered. The Senshi of the Winds 
then turned to Kihomi, a wicked smile on her face.

&quot;Anything you wish to add, Mick oba-san?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; the teacher shouted as she sprang from the couch. Haruka 
was to the front door first, sprinting around the lawn into the backyard 
with the teacher hot on her heels. The other Senshi all ran outside to 
watch the two laughing women run around the house.

&quot;Great. Now there&#39;s two of them.&quot; Michiru joked.

Behind the group watching the spectacle, Minako leaned over to Rei.

&quot;That was pretty brave of Makoto and Ami, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked.

Rei turned to her and smiled, &quot;You&#39;re not thinking of finally telling 
everyone about us, are you?&quot;

The Senshi of love took the priestess&#39; hand in hers, &quot;Maybe, but not 
today. Let them have their day.&quot; she answered.

Everyone&#39;s fun was interrupted by an explosion coming from Tokyo&#39;s 
shopping district. A second soon followed. Haruka and Kihomi were no 
longer chasing each other as they stared with the others at the 
billowing black smoke rising into the sky.

&quot;You ready?&quot; Haruka asked as she pulled her henshin wand out.

Kihomi nodded as she pulled her wand out as well, &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; she said.

Moments later the Sailor Senshi, this time joined by Sailor Minerva, 
raced off to face a new adventure.
