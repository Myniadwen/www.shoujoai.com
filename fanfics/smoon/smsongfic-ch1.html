<p>I can't Stand My Ground anymore.</p>
<p>&quot;Sailor Mars: Great Hero or Coward?&quot;</p>
<p>Rei  sharply turned to the electronics window and frowned. &quot; Ayumi Haruno  here. This days disscusion is about the firey member of the Sailor  Senshi: Sailor Mars.&quot; the tawny haired woman on the screen grinned and  flipped her hair over her shoulder. &quot;Rumor has it that she died. Is  that true Taru?&quot;</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>I can see, when you stay low nothing happens...</em></p>
<p><em>Does it feel right:--:</em></p>
<p>&quot;Not  really.&quot; answered the blonde man across from her. &quot;She simply quit. So  suddenly, it makes you wonder. Was she a a big baby underneath that  volcanic temper of hers?&quot;</p>
<p>Rei scoffed and turned around, walked back to her apartment complex. Stupid reporters.</p>
<p>Damn them for bringing up bad memories.</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>Late at night, thing I'd put behind me...</em></p>
<p><em>Haunt my mind. :--:</em></p>
<p>The  raven-haired girl unlocked her door and shuffled in. The apartment was  nearly empty, only the essenstials. She didn't even have a friggin'  bed. The cream colored walls were completely bare. No pictures of  herself or her family and friends.</p>
<p>Nothing to bring up the past.</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>I just know there's no escape now, once it's set its eyes on you,</em></p>
<p><em>But I won't have to stare it in the eyes.:--:</em></p>
<p>Dammit. Rei sat down on her old couch and closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Three years. Three years since she had quit the Senshi. Three years since she'd seen--</p>
<p><em>'Don't think of her name!</em>'</p>
<p><em>:--: Stand my Ground I won't give in</em>.</p>
<p><em>No more denying, I've got to face it.:--:</em></p>
<p>A choked sob escaped her throat. How was she? Was she okay? Was she happy with...<strong><em>him</em></strong>?  Rei hunched over and grabbed her head. No! No no no no! She'd finally  been able to stop thinking about her past life. As Sailor Mars.  As...Rei Hino.</p>
<p>As somebody with a future.</p>
<p>Now she was simply Rei. A girl who'd abandoned her home and her friends because she was afraid of pain.</p>
<p>God, she was such a coward.</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside.</em></p>
<p><em>If I don't make it, someone else will</em></p>
<p><em>Stand my Ground:--:</em></p>
<p>In an attempt to bury more memories, she turned on her television and switched it to the news.</p>
<p>What she got was the shock of her life.</p>
<p>Sailor  Moon stared at the camera. &quot;What do you want to say?&quot; the reporter  asked kindly. Sailor Moon swallowed. &quot;R--Mars-chan. Please come back.  Please? We need you. I need you. Please Mars, don't ru--&quot;</p>
<p>Rei ripped the cord out of the outlet. She grabbed her coat and walked out the door and slammed it.</p>
<p>She needed some air.</p>
<p><em>:--: It's all around, getting stronger coming closer...</em></p>
<p><em>Into my world...:--:</em></p>
<p><em>'Why?'</em></p>
<p>Rei held her forehead as she leaned against a brick wall.</p>
<p><em>'Why did she have to do that?'</em></p>
<p>She clenched her fists so hard that a few droplets of blood escaped to the ground.</p>
<p><em>'Does she think that saying 'Please' will get me back?!'</em></p>
<p>Tears scalded her face. A hiccup jolted her chest and left her breathless.</p>
<p>--<em><strong>Won't it</strong></em>?--</p>
<p>Suddenly, the filthy alleyway she was in morphed. Osaka faded and became a feild of casblanca lillies.</p>
<p>Rei looked around. &quot;Where am I?&quot; she murrmured.</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>I can feel, that it's time for me to face it...</em></p>
<p><em>Can I take it?:--:</em></p>
<p>--<em><strong>Wherever you want to be</strong></em>.--</p>
<p>Rei looked up. Staring back at her, was herself.</p>
<p>Better yet, it was Princess Mars.</p>
<p>Rei blinked and shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p><em>'No way. That can't be me...</em>'</p>
<p>The  woman was hauntingly beautiful, obsidian locks cascading down her back  like a waterfall. Violet eyes stared back at her, the crimson dress she  wore clinging to her form like she had been born into it.</p>
<p>Rei swallowed thickly. <em>'That is <strong>not</strong> me...'</em></p>
<p>-<strong><em>I am. Just not the part you see very often</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>The woman's lips never moved when she spoke. <em>'Telepathy huh?'</em> --<em><strong>Indeed</strong></em>.-- The princess closed her eyes breifly.</p>
<p><em>:--:</em> <em>Though this might just be the ending, of all I love and hold dear,</em></p>
<p><em>I just know there's no going back from here...:--:</em></p>
<p>She opened her eyes and violet became ruby. --<em><strong>Stop running away</strong></em>.--</p>
<p>Rei flinched and turned away. &quot;I'm not running away.&quot; she murmured. She heard the princess scoff. --<em><strong>I'll believe that when pigs fly out of my ass</strong></em>.--</p>
<p>The miko whipped her head to face her past self again. &quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>-- <strong><em>Don't act so surprised. I got that from you</em></strong>.--</p>
<p><em>:--: Stand my Ground I won't give in.</em></p>
<p><em>No more denying; I've gotta face it :--:</em></p>
<p>--<strong><em>She needs you</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>&quot;She has Mamoru-san.&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>What if she wants you?</em></strong> --</p>
<p>&quot;She doesn't.&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>You sure?</em></strong> --</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>You want to risk the heartache? The pain?</em></strong>--</p>
<p>&quot; No.&quot;</p>
<p>-- <strong><em>Even when that risk may end up being that she loves you with all her heart?</em></strong> --</p>
<p>&quot;Still no.&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>Coward</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>&quot;Tell me something I don't already know.&quot;</p>
<p>:--: <strong>Won't close my eyes</strong>:--:</p>
<p>&quot;Besides, I don't have my henshin wand anymore. Can't really do anything now can I?&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>If you could, would you fight beside her again?--</em></strong></p>
<p>&quot;What does it matter? I'm not Sailor Mars anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>-- <strong><em>Answer my question.</em></strong> --</p>
<p>&quot;...Yes...but, I can't--&quot;</p>
<p>And  then, heat flared from her chest, originating from her heart and  spreading throughout her body like wildfire. Rei gasped as molten heat  surrounded her.</p>
<p><em>'These flames...</em>' she closed her eyes in bliss.<em> 'I've missed this...'</em> When the flames fizzled out, there was no Rei. There was only Sailor Mars.</p>
<p><em>:--: And hide, the truth inside,</em></p>
<p><em>If I don't make it, someone else will :--:</em></p>
<p>--<em><strong>You shall always be Sailor Mars. Henshin wand or not</strong></em>.--</p>
<p>Sailor  Mars was silent as she flexed her gloved fist. The heat the pumped in  her veins was so amazing. Like a peice had been fitted inside of her.</p>
<p>--<strong><em>Now you have no excuse</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>The white feild began to fade into the dark alley once more.</p>
<p>--<strong><em>No excuses...--</em></strong></p>
<p><em>:--: All I know for sure, is I'm tryin' :--:</em></p>
<p>Sailor  Mars re-awoke and shot to her feet. Breathing in deeply, she crouched  down before leaping into the air, her super-human strength allowing her  to make it to the top of a roof in a single bound. Grinning, she ran as  fast as she could to Tokyo.</p>
<p><em>:--: I, will always stand my ground...:--:</em></p>
<p>Sailor  Moon cried out as the youma shoved her against the building. It was an  ugly brute, looking like a cross between a hedgehog and a squid.</p>
<p>It leaned down and growled into her ear, &quot;Where's your precious senshi now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Right here!&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor Moon's eyes widened. &quot;R-Rei-chan?&quot;</p>
<p><em>:--: Stand my Ground I won't give in!</em></p>
<p><em>I won't give up:--:</em></p>
<p>Sailor Mars gathered her energy into the palms of her hands. &quot;Mars...&quot;</p>
<p>Clasping her hands in front of her, she smirked and released the burning wave inside of her.</p>
<p>&quot;Fire Snake!&quot;</p>
<p>The  snake made of fire exploded out of her hands and twined around the  youma, squeezing before it opened its jaws wide. The youma shreiked as  the fire snake swallowed it whole, before it dissoled into ash.</p>
<p><em>:--: No more denying, I've got to face it</em></p>
<p><em>Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside</em></p>
<p><em>If I don't make it, someone else will...:--:</em></p>
<p>Sailor  Mars flipped her hair over her shoulder. &quot;Easy.&quot; she scoffed. Turning  to the breathless Sailor Moon, she smiled warmly and said,</p>
<p>&quot;C'mon Odango-chan. Don't make me save you all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor Moon's lip quivered. &quot;Rei-chan!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Stop being mean to me!&quot;</p>
<p>Mars  laughed and crouched near her princess. &quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she murmured as  she gently wiped away the blonde's tears with her thumb. &quot;you know that  I didn't mean it.&quot;</p>
<p><em>:--: Stand my ground I won't give in. No more denying,</em></p>
<p><em>I've got to face it...:--:</em></p>
<p>Sailor  Moon hiccuped and practically tackled Mars. &quot;Ah! Usagi!?&quot; Mars gasped  as a rosy blush covered her cheeks. &quot;What are you--!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Shut-up!&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor Mars blinked and wisley buttoned her yap.</p>
<p><em>:--: Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside.:--:</em></p>
<p>&quot;You  left me...&quot; came the soft whimper. &quot;Why? I needed you Rei-chan.&quot; The  moon hime turned her face near the goddess of flames'. &quot;Why? Am I that  bad?&quot;</p>
<p>Mars flinched. This wasn't good...</p>
<p>&quot;It wasn't you...&quot; she whispered. &quot;You could never make me leave. I just needed some time away---&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>You're making excuses again</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>&quot;J-just a, vacation and...Usagi...I...I&quot;</p>
<p>--<strong><em>Tell her. Don't hide it anymore</em></strong>.--</p>
<p>&quot;I love you.&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor Mars gasped as a pair of lips settled over her own.</p>
<p>Sailor Moon had beaten her to the punch line.</p>
<p><em>:--: If I don't make it...:--:</em></p>
<p>Rei let her henshin fade and deepened the kiss, feeling Usagi do the same.</p>
<p><em>:--: Someone else will...:--:</em></p>
<p>--<strong><em>Well done Rei. You've stood your ground. Well done.--</em></strong></p>
<p><em>:--: Stand my Ground...:--:</em></p>
<p>&quot;Shut-up,&quot; Rei murmured into the kiss. Usagi pulled back and glared. &quot;What?!&quot;</p>
<p>Rei immediatly panicked. &quot;N-not you!&quot; she wailed. Usagi scofed. &quot;Oh sure it wasn't me! God, I knew this was a bad--mff!&quot;</p>
<p>Rei knew there were two ways to make Usagi shut up; with food and with a kiss.</p>
<p>And she didn't have a burger handy.</p>
