<h1>Sailor Moon V: The Dark Adventures of the Sailor Scouts (part 7 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tstanton.html">Troy "Silver" Stanton</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/smoonv-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Susan, what&#39;s that?&quot; the six-year-old asked quietly as she pressed 
her fingertip against the glass casing. 

Sailor Pluto looked up from the book she was reading and cast a glance 
in the indicated direction. &quot;A collection of books that belonged to 
your great-grandmother,&quot; she said. &quot;They&#39;re rather old and fragile, 
which is why they&#39;ve been put into protective storage.&quot; 

The child shook her head, sending her jet-black bangs flying back and 
forth. &quot;Not the books, that,&quot; she said, emphasizing her meaning with a 
jab of her finger against the glass. 

Pluto blinked for a moment as her mind tried to recall what else might 
have been sealed in the casings. Her demonic memory drew a blank and 
she mentally shrugged, seting her book aside as she stood up. &quot;Let me 
see,&quot; she said as she walked over to the case. &quot;You mean that little 
box on the second shelf, near the very end?&quot; 

&quot;Yes,&quot; the child replied instantly. 

&quot;Oh, that,&quot; Pluto chuckled as she finally remembered what it was. 
&quot;That is the deck of tarot cards that your great-grandmother sometimes 
used in her spiritual readings.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s tarrow?&quot; she asked, fumbling over the unfamilar syllables. 

&quot;Tarot,&quot; Pluto corrected gently out of sheer reflex. &quot;It&#39;s....&quot; she 
said slowly as she sought the best phrasing that would make sense to 
the child. 

&quot;One method of fortune-telling,&quot; came the soft voice of Sailor Mars as 
she entered the library and moved next to Sailor Pluto. &quot;The cards are 
randomly drawn, and it is said that the Hand of Fate guides the teller 
into picking the cards that symbolize whatever it is that is being 
asked or sought.&quot; 

&quot;Hi, Aria!&quot; the little girl said as she darted forward to hug the new 
arrival. 

Mars chuckled quietly to herself and returned the enthusiastic 
embrace. &quot;Hello, Hotaru. I see you&#39;re feeling better today.&quot; 

&quot;The resilience of youth,&quot; Pluto observed with a faint smile. 

&quot;Do you use tarrow cards in your medada.... met....&quot; Hotaru fumbled. 

&quot;Meditations,&quot; Pluto said slowly. 

Mars shook her head. &quot;No, astrology is the domain of your House, not 
mine. I deal with the spiritual that comes from within.&quot; 

Hotaru blinked and turned her attention back to the ancient deck in 
the case. &quot;But why....?&quot; 

Mars coughed quickly. &quot;I think that answer would take quite some time 
for even Sailor Pluto to explain,&quot; she interjected to stem off the 
question. She was fully aware of Hotaru&#39;s extremely high intelligence, 
but also knew that her ability to fully comprehend was still somewhat 
overshadowed by her sense of curiosity. More than a few crying fits 
had erupted when she got curious about something but couldn&#39;t quite 
grasp a solid understanding. 

&quot;Most likely,&quot; Pluto agreed with only a slight pause. 

Hotaru frowned slightly at the interruption. She reached out to touch 
the glass casing again and paused. &quot;The Hand of Fate guides you when 
you read the cards?&quot; she asked slowly. 

Both Sailor Scouts blinked at the unexpected question. &quot;So I&#39;ve been 
told,&quot; Mars said slowly, &quot;But I&#39;ve never used tarot cards before. I 
think Sailor Pluto has before, though.&quot; 

&quot;Several times, yes, but only as a hobby,&quot; Pluto replied. 

&quot;Were you guided by Fate?&quot; the six-year-old asked. 

&quot;Well.... I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Pluto replied truthfully. &quot;I mean, the 
readings were somewhat accurate, but they are usually very difficult 
to interpret except in a very generalized sense.&quot; 

Hotaru paused to digest this as she continued to stare at the deck. 
Pluto took the opportunity to lean towards Mars and very quietly 
whisper, &quot;So how&#39;s the Queen?&quot; 

Mars sighed. &quot;Lady Mercury was frustrated to the point of tears an 
hour ago, if that&#39;s any indication,&quot; she whispered back, equally as 
softly. &quot;She doesn&#39;t think the Queen&#39;s in any mortal danger, but she&#39;s 
very worried about that faint rasp in her voice for some reason.&quot; 

&quot;Dryness?&quot; 

Mars supressed a snort. &quot;With as much herbal tea my mother keeps 
feeding her? I think not.&quot; 

&quot;Can I hold the cards?&quot; Hotaru said suddenly, startling them both. 

&quot;That&#39;s probably not a good idea, Hotaru,&quot; Mars said gently. &quot;They are 
very old and....&quot; 

&quot;But aren&#39;t they part of my House?&quot; Hotaru asked tentatively. 

&quot;Well, yes....&quot; Mars said slowly. 

&quot;Which means I&#39;ll have to use them soon, right?&quot; 

Mars paused as she realized where this was heading. &quot;Actually....&quot; 

&quot;So I should start practicing now so I&#39;ll be ready when I become a 
Sailor Scout like you and Susan, right?&quot; 

&quot;Um, maybe not right now, but....&quot; 

&quot;And didn&#39;t the Lady Mars suggest that I start learning soon?&quot; 

Sailor Pluto chuckled dryly. &quot;I think you&#39;ve been out-maneuvered, 
Aria.&quot; 

Mars shot Pluto a dark glare. &quot;She&#39;s your student,&quot; she muttered. 

&quot;As you were once mine,&quot; Pluto replied gently. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t raise me,&quot; Sailor Mars grumbled, almost too softly for 
Pluto&#39;s demonic hearing to pick up. 

Hotaru&#39;s jet-black eyes darted back and forth between the two of them 
as she tried to make sense of the fragments of speech she was hearing. 
She had long ago figured out that people whispered around her when 
they were discussing things they didn&#39;t want her to hear, such as her 
frail life-force and the Queen&#39;s current ill health. 

&quot;Admit it, you don&#39;t like the idea of being cornered by a girl 
one-third your age,&quot; Sailor Pluto observed lightly with a faint smile. 

&quot;Alright, alright,&quot; Mars fumed, her temper starting to fray at the 
edges. &quot;I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea, but I&#39;m not going to 
file a complaint with our beloved Minister Dejanna or anything,&quot; she 
grumbled, referring to the current Minister of Science. &quot;And I&#39;m not 
taking responsibility.&quot; 

&quot;No one asked you to,&quot; Pluto said consolingly as she turned to Hotaru. 
&quot;I will let you hold them, Hotaru, but you must be very careful. They 
are very old and could be easily damaged.&quot; 

Hotaru nodded solemnly. &quot;I promise to be careful.&quot; 

&quot;Spoken like a true six-year-old,&quot; Sailor Mars muttered. 

&quot;Aria, go find something to do before I tell her the story about the 
jar of coconut oil,&quot; Sailor Pluto said lightly as she turned her 
attention to the storage casing and began to unlock the front panel. 

Sailor Mars shot her a dark look and mumbled something incoherent 
beneath her breath. &quot;I&#39;ll catch you to later,&quot; she said and left the 
library. 

Hotaru blinked and cast a questioning glance at Pluto. &quot;What jar of 
coconut oil?&quot; she inquired. 

&quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Pluto demurred as she finished entering the 
cipher codes into the lock. The lock clicked open and there was a 
faint hiss of escaping gas as the nitrogen seal was broken. She only 
opened the panel as long as necessary to reach in and remove the deck 
of cards before she firmly shut it and triggered the resealing 
process. 

&quot;Ick,&quot; Hotaru coughed as she pinched her nose shut. 

&quot;The gas is designed to prevent oxygen from speeding up the process of 
decay,&quot; Pluto explained as she idly waved her free hand under her nose 
for a moment. &quot;It smells terrible, but that&#39;s actually a good thing as 
it doesn&#39;t encourage someone to try to break into the storage cases. 
Here,&quot; she said as she handed the ancient tarot cards to the young 
girl she was essentially raising as her own daughter. 

Hotaru&#39;s black eyes went wide as she felt the deck&#39;s weight in her 
hands. &quot;Why is it so warm?&quot; 

Pluto blinked hard and reached out to touch the deck. &quot;I don&#39;t feel 
any temperature difference,&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;You don&#39;t? That&#39;s funny.... maybe because you have wings?&quot; 

Pluto felt her insides twinge faintly. Everyone in the kingdom knew of 
her half-human/half-demon heritage, but she had made a conscious 
effort to avoid explaining some aspects to Hotaru until she was sure 
she could fully understand them. &quot;I don&#39;t think that has anything to 
do with it, but you never know,&quot; she said neutrally. 

Hotaru barely heard her. She was absolutely captivated by the deck of 
cards for some strange reason. With deliberate slowness, she opened 
the box and removed the stack of well-used cards, handing the box back 
to Pluto. &quot;The cards feel strange,&quot; she said quietly. 

A very cold wind blew through Pluto&#39;s bones. &quot;How so?&quot; she asked as 
she fought a sudden urge to snatch the cards away from her. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; the child admitted. &quot;They just.... feel strange.&quot; 

&quot;Do you know what to do with the cards?&quot; Pluto asked gently. 

&quot;Umm.... I just draw a few, right?&quot; Hotaru said with uncertainity. 

Pluto nodded and sat down on the ground. &quot;Well, drawing is half of it. 
The other half is trying to determine the meaning of the cards.&quot; 

Hotaru paused to assimilate the information before she sat down and 
set the deck on the ground, slowly and carefully spreading the cards 
in an arc in front of her. 

&quot;Usually you&#39;re supposed to shuffle the deck before you draw,&quot; Pluto 
said in a gentle tone. &quot;That&#39;s to help remove any remaining influences 
from other readings.&quot; 

Hotaru blinked and looked up. &quot;I thought the Hand of Fate was supposed 
to guide me when I drew the cards,&quot; she said, almost as if in protest. 

&quot;Well, that&#39;s true,&quot; Pluto admitted. 

Hotaru studied the array of cards before her before she slowly 
extended a fingertip towards the first card in the stack. She paused 
just short of touching it and very slowly moved her hand over the rest 
of the cards. She paused with her finger over one card and frowned. 
&quot;This one feels different than the rest,&quot; she said quietly. 

Pluto&#39;s breath immediately snagged in her throat. She has the gift, 
she thought silently to herself, a gift that her bloodline hasn&#39;t seen 
in three hundred years. &quot;Well, if that&#39;s the one you want, then draw 
it and flip it over so we can see,&quot; she said as evenly as she could 
manage. 

Hotaru nodded and carefully withdrew the card from the stack before 
she laid it down face-up above the deck. The picture of a red-robed 
being holding the banner of a white rose looked up at them, and Pluto 
could feel her jaw sagging open of its own volition. 

&quot;Death?&quot; Hotaru breathed as she read the single word scrolled along 
the bottom of the card. &quot;Susan, what&#39;s this mean?&quot; 

It took a moment of great effort before Pluto could close her mouth. 
&quot;It represents the force of Death, Hotaru, but not necessarily 
literally. It often can mean a major or catastrophic change instead. 
It is a very powerful card, but without some sort of influence to tell 
us if it&#39;s a good or a bad thing, the card itself is meaningless.&quot; 

The future Sailor Scout paused to think for a very long time. &quot;So this 
means it would help to draw another card to try to explain the 
meaning?&quot; she ventured after what had to be a full minute of silence 
and contemplation. 

Pluto blinked hard and thought carefully. If she does have the gift, 
then this really does have a meaning.... and it will happen regardless 
of whether or not she becomes aware of it. &quot;Yes,&quot; she finally said 
slowly, &quot;You&#39;re right, we would need another card to explain this.&quot; 

Hotaru nodded and studied the array of cards in front of her before 
she slowly reached out and withdrew another card. She flipped it 
face-up next to the first card and studied the picture: A man in a 
black cloak standing over a pool of blood spilling from five gold 
goblets that had been dropped at his feet. &quot;What&#39;s this one?&quot; she 
asked. 

It took a moment for Pluto to find her voice. &quot;The Five of Cups,&quot; she 
finally managed to say with a faint tremble in her voice despite her 
best efforts. &quot;The suit of Cups are generally linked to matters of the 
heart and material comfort. However, the Five of Cups usually 
represents a sense of loss or despair.&quot; 

Hotaru blinked. &quot;This is a bad influence on Death, right?&quot; she asked 
very slowly as her pale complexion lost most of what little color she 
had to begin with. 

Sailor Pluto couldn&#39;t lie to her. &quot;I&#39;m afraid so, Hotaru,&quot; she said, 
almost in a whisper. &quot;Listen to me very carefully.... I dearly hope 
I&#39;m wrong about this, but it seems you have a natural gift for 
astrology. It used to be very common in your bloodline, but the last 
Lady Saturn to possess it was over three hundred years ago. There has 
always been a strong tie between your House and astrology, just as 
there has been a tie between the House of Mars and the spiritual.&quot; 

Her bottomless black eyes went wide as she absorbed the information. 
&quot;So what does this mean?&quot; she said as she gestured to the deck. &quot;Is 
that why it feels funny to me?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Pluto said carefully, &quot;But I can&#39;t say for sure unless we 
observe your readings for some time to determine their accuracy and 
hence the strength of your gift.&quot; 

There was another protracted silence as Hotaru sought to process the 
new information and apply it to her present situation. &quot;Susan, my 
ancist.... cest....&quot; 

&quot;Ancestor.&quot; 

&quot;How accurate was she?&quot; 

Pluto swallowed hard. &quot;In retrospect? Never wrong,&quot; she said quietly. 

&quot;Then.... someone is going to die, right?&quot; Hotaru said, her skin now a 
sickly shade of white. 

&quot;There is a good possibility of that,&quot; Sailor Pluto replied. &quot;However, 
bear in mind this is just an interpretation. It might not mean a 
literal death.&quot; 

Hotaru studied the two face-up cards for a moment. &quot;Would drawing a 
third card tell us more? Like who it is going to aff.... affect?&quot; she 
said, adding the last word with hesitation. 

&quot;You pronounced it correctly,&quot; Pluto replied as she chewed on the edge 
of her lips, trying to decide if she should permit the reading to 
continue. She was intimately familar with death, but Hotaru was only a 
child. A child whose mother died giving birth to her and as a result 
would probably never have the strength to survive birthing her own 
daughter, she darkly reminded herself. 

She sighed quietly and made a decison. &quot;Yes, a third card might make 
it clearer.... but you have to understand this now, Hotaru, that no 
matter what good or ill comes from the reading, you are not at fault.&quot; 

Hotaru blinked hard before she slowly nodded and ran her fingertips 
over the array of cards for a third time. She twitched slightly as she 
snatched her finger away from a card. &quot;Hey, that started to 
tingle....&quot; 

Pluto felt her throat constrict again. &quot;Just that one card?&quot; 

Hotaru quickly checked the other cards and nodded. &quot;Yes, just this 
one. Is that supposed to be the Hand of Fate?&quot; she asked as she 
gestured to the card that had bothered her. 

She chose her words carefully. &quot;Well, if you feel as if one particular 
card is standing out from the rest, then perhaps it is a suggestion.&quot; 

Hotaru nodded and reached for the card, gently tugging it free before 
flipping it face-up next to the Five of Cups. The picture showed a dog 
and a wolf, sitting by a small pond and howling up at a massive moon. 
&quot;The Moon,&quot; she said as she read the words scrolled at the bottom. 

Sailor Pluto was on her feet in an instant as the shock tore through 
her like a lightning bolt. Two bulges formed on her back and exploded 
outward into demonic wings, easily tearing through the specially 
designed strips of thin fabric on the back of her Sailor Suit. Her 
hand came up to her throat and began twisting the tiny star that 
adorned the ribbon around her neck. She turned it to the right until 
it clicked twice, then pressed inward and down until she felt it catch 
on a hook and stay in place. 

&quot;Susan, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Hotaru said, startled by her sudden reaction. 

&quot;Pluto to Mercury,&quot; she said as a small rod unfolded from the rear 
edge of her tiara and settled into place directly over her ear canal. 
She heard a click from the tiny speaker inside before she heard the 
throaty sound of the collar-based microphone being used at the other 
end. 

came the voice of Sailor Mercury. 

&quot;Find your mother and meet me at the Queen&#39;s bedside,&quot; she snapped as 
she made a snatching motion in the air. Her staff seemed to 
materialize out of thin air as it slapped into her palm. 

the voice in her ear started to say. 

&quot;NOW, Amelia, I&#39;ll explain later. Out,&quot; she said sharply as she 
flicked the star with her thumb, closing the link. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong? What did I do?&quot; Hotaru started to cry in anguish. 

Pluto paused to kneel down and gently grip her shoulder. &quot;You didn&#39;t 
do anything, Hotaru. In fact, you might have even warned us.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s the Queen, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she sniffed. &quot;You think she&#39;s going to 
die.&quot; 

&quot;Maybe not, but she is sick and I&#39;m not going to take a chance with 
this one,&quot; she explained. 

&quot;I&#39;m coming with you,&quot; she said suddenly and scooped up the tarot 
cards. 

Pluto was about to protest when she remembered another duty of the 
House of Saturn, one that mirrored her own duties with disturbing 
closeness. &quot;Very well, then,&quot; she said as she wrapped her arm around 
Hotaru&#39;s waist and lifted her up in an embrace that probably wasn&#39;t as 
gentle as she would have liked. Then making sure she had a firm grip 
on her staff, she sent them both into a temporal vortex destined to 
emerge only a moment later in a different spot.... 

And with a sharp gasp, Susan bolted upright in her bed as the dream of 
a memory dissolved around her like sand through an open hand. There 
was a squeak of protest as the kitten that had been sleeping on her 
bare chest was sent tumbling to the edge of the bed and almost onto 
the floor. 

&quot;Damn,&quot; she muttered softly to herself as she fully woke up. She 
glanced at the window and saw that sunrise was still a couple hours 
away. &quot;Myst, are you alright?&quot; 

The silky gray kitten uncurled herself and gave Susan a dazed look. 
&quot;You had a nightmare?&quot; 

Susan shook her head. &quot;No, I was just reliving a memory in the form of 
a dream, that&#39;s all,&quot; she said as she laid back down with a soft sigh. 

&quot;A bad memory?&quot; Myst asked as she carefully made her way back over to 
the succubus and settled herself down next to her shoulder. 

&quot;Not so much bad as.... unpleasant,&quot; Susan replied quietly. &quot;A very 
young Sailor Saturn warning me of the Queen&#39;s death just before it 
happens.&quot; 

The Shinma said nothing as Susan began stroking her soft fur absently. 
&quot;I just find it odd that I would remember that particular memory in a 
dream instead of something else, or a dream itself,&quot; Susan continued. 
&quot;And I&#39;m not sure why it woke me up like it did. Did you happen to 
dream?&quot; 

&quot;No, I was fortunate this time,&quot; Myst replied quietly. 

Susan made a soft noise to herself, knowing that sometimes a dreamless 
sleep is preferable to being at the mercy of one&#39;s subconscious mind. 
But still, she continued to wonder, of all the things to remember.... 
why this? 

The question seemed to echo in her mind for very long time until the 
first rays of the dawning sun began to refocus her mind to other 
matters.

Alex grunted softly to herself as something woke her up. Her 
subconscious mind twitched her elbow very gently and quickly assured 
her that, if nothing else, Michelle was still sleeping next to her. 
The realization didn&#39;t fully register in her brain, but it was enough 
to prevent a mental alarm from going off and shocking her into full 
consciousness. 

She was giving serious consideration to simply going back to sleep 
when the room was very briefly lit by a muted flash of light. A 
subvocal grunt of protest emerged from her throat as she lifted her 
head off of the pillow and opened her eyes, trying to see through the 
blur caused by still being only half-awake. 

Susan carefully unhooked the cargo container from the load-bearing 
webbing she had strapped to her back and eased it onto the floor as 
quietly as she could. Beside her was a second cargo container that 
seemed identical to the first, both of which were marked with a pair 
of sigils that denoted their owners. &quot;Good morning,&quot; she said very 
quietly as she noticed Alex&#39;s bleary gaze in her direction. 

&quot;... th&#39; hell?&quot; the blonde mumbled as she carefully edged her arm out 
from under Michelle and sat up, ignoring the sheets as they tumbled 
away to expose her small breasts. Michelle stirred slightly but 
remained fast asleep, totally oblivious to the world around her. 

&quot;A few things from the Moon Kingdom, mostly clothes,&quot; Susan replied in 
a quiet voice. &quot;I returned to a point in time shortly after the attack 
took place but before the Shield collapsed, which didn&#39;t give me much 
time to gather everything together.&quot; 

&quot;Underwear?&quot; Alex said as she fully woke up. She tossed the covers 
aside to expose the rest of her nude body and carefully eased herself 
out of bed, trying not to disturb Michelle. She quickly made her way 
over to the cargo containers and opened the first one. &quot;Oh, crap, what 
is that smell?&quot; she muttered as she sorted through the stack of 
clothes inside. 

&quot;You don&#39;t want to know,&quot; Susan replied in a tone that made Alex 
shiver. 

&quot;Okay. Ah, here we go,&quot; Alex said with satisfaction as she dug a pair 
of panties out of the container and put them on. &quot;Oh, yeah, this is 
what I&#39;m talking about.... clean, dry underwear,&quot; she cooed. 

&quot;I know what you mean. I&#39;m going to see if I have enough time to get a 
few more things,&quot; Susan said as she readjusted the webbing. &quot;However, 
don&#39;t count on anything. I got the impression on the last trip that I 
was getting very close to a temporal overlap, and that&#39;s something I 
have to avoid at all costs.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, whatever that means,&quot; the blonde replied, only half-listening 
as she sorted through the rest of the container&#39;s contents. &quot;Great, 
you got my good pair of sweatpants. You&#39;re a sweetheart.&quot; 

The succubus just shook her head. &quot;Michelle&#39;s clothes and a few 
personal effects are in the other container. I suggest you both take 
the time to sort through them after breakfast so you have a good idea 
of what else you might need me to acquire. Did you sleep well?&quot; 

&quot;Like a rock,&quot; Alex said as she dug a sports bra out of the container 
and slipped it on. &quot;I think we both pretty much conked out as soon as 
we hit the pillows.&quot; 

&quot;Good,&quot; Susan replied as she made a snatching motion at the air. Her 
staff seemed to materialize out of nowhere as it quietly slapped into 
her palm. &quot;I sense that we&#39;ll need as much of our strength as 
possible. This morning shouldn&#39;t be too taxing, but this afternoon is 
going to be quite the opposite.&quot; 

Alex winced slightly as Susan disappeared in a brief flash of temporal 
energy. &quot;I hate it when she gets all mysterious like that,&quot; she 
muttered to herself as she started to open the second cargo container. 
She froze as she heard a sound behind her and felt a gentle touch on 
her arm. 

&quot;Love, you need to quit sneaking up on me like that,&quot; she said quietly 
as she let out her breath. 

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Michelle breathed softly as she slid her arms around the 
blonde&#39;s waist and pressed herself close. &quot;What did she bring us?&quot; 

&quot;Mostly clothes,&quot; Alex murmurred as she brought her hands up to cover 
Michelle&#39;s. She could feel the softness of Michelle&#39;s bare breasts 
pressed against her back, the hardened nipples sending an almost 
electric thrill down her spine as they slowly moved back and forth. 

&quot;Mmmmm....&quot; Michelle purred softly in her ear as her fingertips slowly 
traced a path up from Alex&#39;s stomach to the bottom edge of her bra. 
&quot;Do we need them right now, or do we still have awhile before 
breakfast?&quot; 

&quot;I see you slept well,&quot; Alex replied almost breathlessly as she felt 
the sports bra slide up to expose the swells of her breasts. 

&quot;Of course, I have you to sleep next to me,&quot; Michelle replied quietly 
as she lightly brushed her lips across lover&#39;s neck, drawing a soft 
sigh from the blonde. Her hands came up to gently cup Alex&#39;s small 
breasts, very slowly rolling the hardening nipples against her palms. 

Humans, Myst thought to herself from her vantage point beneath the bed 
as she watched the two lovers with only slight interest in their 
activities. I&#39;ll never understand their fascination with each other&#39;s 
bodies. Shaking her head to herself, she merged herself with the deep 
shadows under the bed and entered the demiplane of existence that she 
had discovered only a few hours ago. 

The room seemed to warp and bend slightly as the fundamental 
properties of light were altered. Solid objects became partially 
translucent and almost all the color was drained away, shifted into 
gauzy stains of pale reds, light blues, and sickly greens. Shadows 
that seemed small and faint before blossomed into massive pools of 
inky darkness, making the room seem smaller than before. 

She paused for a moment to study the spectral images that the humans 
had become. They were transparent enough to almost be invisible, 
ghostly figures with very blurry, undefined details. Faint auras 
surrounded them both, bright yellow for Alex and aquamarine sharply 
edged in black for Michelle. The colors seemed to bleed from one aura 
to the other as they touched and caressed in what was seen as very 
slow motion, moving from the corner of the room over to the fuzzy 
image of the bed. 

Shaking her head to herself again, she started moving through the 
strange demiplane, passing through the bedroom wall as if it were only 
an illusion. It had taken her several minutes before to determine that 
objects didn&#39;t fully exist in the demiplane. However, light waves were 
partially able to bleed through from the normal three-dimensional 
plane, thus giving the appearance of an object&#39;s existence. 

She paused for a moment to study the shimmering conduits that ran 
along the inside of the walls, appearing to her to be a glittering 
network of rapid pulses of light. Curious, she started to trace the 
conduits to their source, following the twisting trail of energy 
downward until she arrived in a room dominated by a massive pulsing 
core surrounded by a haze of radiation. 

This doesn&#39;t look good, Myst thought as she started to edge away from 
the reactor core. She briefly considered shifting back to the material 
plane to get a better look, then reconsidered her decision after 
studying the haze of radiation. It seemed to be fully contained in 
what appeared to be a very solid housing, but she wasn&#39;t sure she 
wanted to chance anything. 

She turned around to head back up when she saw a ghostly figure 
walking down the hallway towards the reactor core. The figure stopped 
at the doorway and started touching a small box on the outside, 
triggering a brief flurry of activity in the conduits lining the 
walls. The walls seemed to slide apart after a moment, allowing the 
figure to enter the small room. 

Interesting, she thought as she watched the walls return to their 
usual position. She carefully studied the new arrival, noting that he 
was surrounded by a fairly strong gray aura that seemed to be speckled 
with tiny pinpoints of yellow. The figure moved over to a set of 
controls mounted on a console and seemed to be looking at them 
carefully. 

Curious about what was going on, she shifted herself from the 
demiplane back into the material plane. The process only took a moment 
and then she was suddenly wincing as her senses were bombarded with 
both color and sound. How strange that I didn&#39;t notice sound doesn&#39;t 
exist there, she thought dourly as she batted at her whiskers. 

Tolaris glanced up as he caught motion out of the corner of his eye 
and almost leapt out of his skin. &quot;And where did you come from?&quot; he 
inquired as he slowly let his breath out and glanced back at the 
reactor control panel. &quot;I didn&#39;t see you following me down the 
hallway.&quot; 

&quot;I shifted dimensions,&quot; Myst explained quietly as she sat back and 
started to preen her whiskers. She was still getting used to her 
feline form and had learned that her whiskers provided a great deal of 
sensory information.... as long as they were kept clean. 

&quot;Mmm. I know Whisper can do some sort of dimensional shifting as well, 
but she said it really wasn&#39;t a good idea to spend much time in that 
form,&quot; Tolaris replied absently. His attention was focused on a 
blinking green light on one of the status panels, a light that 
normally would have remained a steady green color. &quot;Great, just 
p&#39;tahk&#39;enn great. Don&#39;t do it, don&#39;t do it....&quot; 

The light turned a solid yellow color and a warning chime began to 
echo in the room. Tolaris sighed quietly as he turned the alarm off 
and let loose with a very long, complex string of profanity. &quot;P&#39;tai,&quot; 
he muttered to himself when he finished and began running a series of 
diagnostics on the reactor. 

Myst blinked at the sudden activity. &quot;Is something wrong?&quot; she asked. 

&quot;Not really, just a plasma filter that&#39;s partially clogged,&quot; the 
Dragoon explained. &quot;However, if we don&#39;t do something about it 
relatively soon, like clean it or replace it, it could start to cause 
problems with the rest of the reactor. And that&#39;s when we start to 
worry. Tolaris to Ra&#39;vel,&quot; he said as he dug out his communicator and 
opened the frequency assigned to the Dragoon sigil. 

There was a slight pause before he saw Ra&#39;vel&#39;s image appear on the 
tiny monitor and heard a slightly scratchy chirp in response. &quot;I&#39;m in 
the reactor control room and I need your help,&quot; Tolaris explained. 
&quot;Level 5 advisory, got a plasma filter that is starting to clog. I 
want to see if you can use your telekinetic powers to pull it out so 
we don&#39;t have to drag out the radiation suits.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel fluffed her feathers and chittered at him for a few moments 
before shrugging in apology. &quot;No problem, just thought I&#39;d ask,&quot; 
Tolaris replied. &quot;Thanks anyway.&quot; The image of Ra&#39;vel nodded before 
the channel closed and fell silent. 

&quot;She doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with using her telekinetic powers on the 
reactor from a distance,&quot; the Dragoon told Myst as he reset the 
communicator and opened a different frequency, this one denoted by the 
Star sigil. &quot;Not that I blame her in the least. Tolaris to Maze.&quot; 

&quot;Morning, boss,&quot; Maze replied as his image appeared on the screen. 

&quot;Idle curiosity.... when was the last time you changed a plasma filter 
on a class 3A reactor unit?&quot; Tolaris asked. 

Maze blinked and sighed. &quot;Idle curiosity, my ptanka. I take it we need 
to have one changed now?&quot; 

&quot;Changed or cleaned, depending on what it looks like,&quot; Tolaris 
replied. &quot;The computer picked up on it last night and flagged it as a 
possible problem. I came down here to check on it and just now got a 
Level 5 advisory.&quot; 

&quot;Just a Level 5?&quot; Maze said as his image heaved a sigh of relief. &quot;Had 
me worried for a moment that we might have had a serious problem on 
our hands.&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled. &quot;Yes, well it&#39;s going to get that way if we don&#39;t do 
something about it. Which brings me back to my first question.&quot; 

&quot;Never worked on a 3A before,&quot; Maze admitted. &quot;Helped tear apart and 
refurbish a class 2A-2 reactor located in the Headquarters Complex, 
though. It&#39;s part of the backup system so it&#39;s not being used 
constantly like this one here is, but at least it didn&#39;t blow up when 
we tested it.&quot; 

Tolaris grunted. &quot;Fair enough. I&#39;ll do the hardsuit part and you can 
handle the console.&quot; 

&quot;Deal. Umm, do I have time for a shower?&quot; Maze inquired. 

Tolaris glanced at the display console for a moment. &quot;Probably, but 
try to keep it short. I think we&#39;re going to have to do a replacement 
instead of just a cleaning, and I&#39;d rather get that over and done with 
as soon as we can.&quot; 

&quot;No problem, just give me ten minutes and I&#39;ll be down there,&quot; Maze 
replied and closed the connection. 

Tolaris just grunted softly as he put his communicator back in his 
pocket. &quot;Probably going to take me that long just to get into the 
hardsuit,&quot; he said, more to the room in general than to Myst. He made 
his way over to a small access hatch at the far corner of the room, 
stripping off various articles of clothing as he went. 

&quot;I will never understand you people and clothes,&quot; Myst said sourly as 
she watched Tolaris finish stripping down to his underwear. 

The Dragoon chuckled dryly. &quot;Try it like this,&quot; he explained as he 
keyed open the access hatch. &quot;We pretty much wear clothes constantly, 
and only take them off when they get in the way, like when you go to 
use the bathroom or take a shower. Or in this case, have to put on a 
skin-tight bodysuit and thick radiation armor. Excuse me,&quot; he added as 
he climbed into the access chamber and sealed the hatch behind him. 

&quot;That helps,&quot; Myst muttered to herself as she walked over to the 
control console and carefully leapt up onto it, making quite sure she 
didn&#39;t touch or bump anything. She threaded her way along the rows of 
controls until she found a space large enough for her to sit down 
comfortably without being in the way of anything, yet still permitted 
her a good view of the reactor housing. 

From what she was able to see, the reactor was housed in a small metal 
sphere supported by two massive conduits on either side. A series of 
small tubes tapped into the sphere in a complex three-dimensional 
pattern, presumably circulating coolant inside the reactor chamber. A 
small airlock stood at the far end of the chamber, and through the 
windows Myst could make out a slightly blurry humanoid figure moving 
around inside. 

Every few seconds she could almost feel a very faint thrum of energy 
from the reactor core. Curious, she scanned the various display panels 
until she found one that showed a sine wave that peaked every time she 
felt a thrum. The wave rose and fell in perfect rhythm, and she took 
that to be a display of the actual power reaction inside the chamber. 

The computer panel next to the door chittered for a brief moment and 
the doors slid open with a pneumatic hiss. Myst raised an eyebrow as a 
slightly damp Dragoon Lieutenant Maze entered, wearing only a pair of 
sweatpants and slippers. He was still in the process of toweling his 
short, spiky purple hair dry and didn&#39;t notice Myst until he was 
almost standing right next to her. 

&quot;Hey, what are you doing down here?&quot; he said as he blinked in 
surprise, wrapping the towel around his shoulders. 

&quot;Just observing,&quot; Myst replied quietly as she started to preen the 
silky gray fur on her tail. 

Maze grunted softly. &quot;Just as long as you&#39;re not sitting on something 
of importance,&quot; he said as he studied the various displays. &quot;Mmm, just 
as long as a clogged plasma filter is the only thing wrong with this 
thing. Low-level maintenance I can deal with. I don&#39;t know what 
Tolaris knows about reactors, but I&#39;m willing to bet we&#39;d be k&#39;vesen 
if we needed something major done. Of course, if something critical 
happened like we lost magnetic containment, it really wouldn&#39;t matter 
if we were engineers or not because we&#39;d all have our ptankas blown 
out the other side in an instant.&quot; 

Myst paused in mid-motion, her tongue still hanging out. &quot;What do you 
need magnets for in a reactor?&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;Not magnets, but magnetic containment fields,&quot; Maze explained as he 
began typing commands on the reactor control console. &quot;We use them to 
store the reactor fuel and keep it isolated from everything else. It&#39;s 
very volatile stuff. Maze to Tolaris,&quot; he said as he keyed open the 
intercom. 

&quot;Almost ready,&quot; came the muffled response from the speaker. &quot;This is 
made a lot simpler because we&#39;re stocked with the same class of 
hardsuits we use at the Complex. I think I&#39;ve put on a little extra 
weight, however, because this thing is a lot tighter than I remember.&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;For shame, Commander. You know we have exercise 
equipment readily available in the training room.&quot; 

There was a soft grunt from the speaker. &quot;Stuff it, Lieutenant, and 
give me a radiation reading on the core,&quot; Tolaris grumped. 

Maze smirked and decided not to comment about who was trying to stuff 
what at the moment. &quot;Seventeen in the core,&quot; he replied as he glanced 
up at the radiation sensor display. &quot;And the reading in the airlock is 
four.&quot; 

&quot;Amusing,&quot; Tolaris replied. There was a sharp click followed by the 
soft hiss of gas over the intercom. &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve sealed the suit, so 
you can link me into the sensor array,&quot; he said, his voice now echoing 
slightly from within the confines of his helmet. &quot;Serial number 
3A2LE7933.&quot; 

Maze keyed in the information into the panel and paused for a moment 
as the suit&#39;s serial number sank into his mind. &quot;Wait a minute.... 
that suit is supposed to be stored at the Lex&#39;eri storage facility, 
right? 7900 series?&quot; 

There was a short pause from the intercom. &quot;Looks that way.&quot; 

&quot;So that&#39;s where they went,&quot; Maze said as he shook his head. &quot;About a 
month after Shar-Tei was put in charge, Little Q tried to requisition 
a few replacement suits from Lex&#39;eri and created quite a stir when he 
found a bunch of them had gone missing. And if memory serves, they 
were all listed under the 7900 series.&quot; 

Tolaris chuckled dryly at the image of the Dragoon Complex 
Quartermaster throwing a fit over &quot;his&quot; cache of supplies at Lex&#39;eri. 
An avian like Ra&#39;vel, the usually dour V&#39;Lan was known unofficially as 
&quot;Little Q&quot; despite his rather large frame, and was reknown for his 
seriousness over the tiniest detail when it came to supply orders and 
storage. 

&quot;Okay, you&#39;re tapped in,&quot; Maze said as the display for Tolaris&#39;s 
hardsuit appeared on his monitor. &quot;External radiation is four, 
internal is zero, and all your vital signs are green.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s a relief,&quot; Tolaris replied dryly. &quot;Reactor status?&quot; 

&quot;Still idling down,&quot; Maze replied as he watched the sine wave display 
that had attracted Myst&#39;s attention earlier. &quot;Give it another thirty 
seconds before I can shunt the plasma into a buffer. Unless, of 
course, you want to play in the deuterium stream, in which case you 
can crack the hatch whenever you want.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll pass, thanks. Speaking of deuterium, what&#39;s our fuel status?&quot; 

&quot;At the current rate of consumption? Serena&#39;s grand-daughter might 
have to worry about it one day, but we&#39;re good for at least another 
fifty years at this rate. I might have to recalculate if we ramp up 
the reactor to start providing power for something else, but I can&#39;t 
imagine anything we have that would draw that much power.&quot; 

&quot;Mina&#39;s laser array?&quot; Tolaris offered. 

&quot;Bah, the only reason that put a dent in the power supply was because 
the reactor was set not to increase power on demand,&quot; Maze replied. 
&quot;Nephlyte had it set to simulate common household power levels for 
some reason. Okay, I&#39;m starting the plasma diversion.&quot; 

There was a heavy sigh from the intercom. &quot;Why do these things always 
have to itch in places where you can&#39;t scratch?&quot; 

&quot;You want me to answer that?&quot; Maze asked with a grin at Myst as he 
kept a close eye on the plasma conduits. 

&quot;Not that question, but I have a different one for you,&quot; Tolaris said. 
&quot;If all Nephlyte wanted to do was simulate common household voltage, 
then why did he use a class 3A reactor? Safety alone would dictate 
that you don&#39;t use any of the type A&#39;s unless you need to power a 
platform that requires a very substantial energy source.&quot; 

Maze paused to consider the question. &quot;I haven&#39;t given it much 
thought, to be honest with you,&quot; he said after a lengthy pause. &quot;I 
mean, I suppose that Nephlyte did intend this to be the eventual base 
of operations for an invasion of Earth. That would mean a massive 
power requirement once things got set into motion, so it would make 
some sense to get the design right the first time instead of trying to 
upgrade the reactor in mid-stream.&quot; 

&quot;True,&quot; Tolaris admitted, &quot;But if you went along with that logic, then 
you would have designed this place as a fortress instead of a 
cathedral.&quot; 

&quot;Hold that thought, boss,&quot; Maze replied as a series of amber lights 
lit up on his console. &quot;The reactor&#39;s now idle and the plasma stream 
has been shunted into the buffer. We&#39;ve got twenty minutes to do this 
before the buffer gets overloaded.&quot; 

&quot;Twenty minutes?&quot; Tolaris said in bemusement. &quot;Usually the specs call 
for a fifteen minute window. I&#39;m opening the airlock now.&quot; 

Maze nodded to himself as he watched a green light go red on his 
panel. &quot;Usually, but keep in mind that this reactor is rated 300 and 
we&#39;ve only been drawing maybe 45 off of it, so we don&#39;t need a large 
plasma flow.&quot; 

Myst blinked as she saw a heavily armored figure step out of the 
airlock and slowly make his way towards the reactor core. &quot;Still, I&#39;m 
going to try to aim for fifteen minutes,&quot; Tolaris replied. &quot;Radiation 
count?&quot; 

&quot;External rising to seventeen, internal is still zero,&quot; Maze said, 
then paused for a moment. &quot;Let me ask you a question that&#39;s been 
bugging me for some time now. Rune knows we&#39;re here in the cathedral, 
right?&quot; 

There was a noise from the speaker that could have been either a grunt 
or a random burst of radiation-induced static. &quot;She knew enough about 
where I was at in order to plan a very intricate trap for me, so I 
wouldn&#39;t be surprised in the least if she did know where we were,&quot; 
Tolaris replied. &quot;East end or west end?&quot; 

Maze consulted the display and frowned. &quot;East end, and the radiation 
count is starting to rise slowly. At twenty-four now, and sensor web 
on the conduit is starting to look a bit unsteady. I think the filter 
is starting to disintegrate.&quot; 

&quot;Wonderful. So much for a simple cleaning.&quot; 

&quot;You know you wanted to do a replacement anyway,&quot; Maze replied as he 
began typing on the control console. &quot;Hey, back up a few feet. You 
want the blue container on your left, the one with two red stripes and 
a yellow starburst. That should have the replacement filters.&quot; 

&quot;Convenient,&quot; Tolaris said as he retrieved the small container. &quot;Odd, 
this is also marked as supposedly in storage at Lex&#39;eri. Makes you 
wonder if there&#39;s a manifest of issued supplies around here 
somewhere.&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;One headache at a time, Commander. Let&#39;s get 
this filter replaced first, then we can worry about where the towels 
came from.&quot; 

&quot;Probably the same place the military gets all that stuff from,&quot; 
Tolaris observed as he carefully carried the metallic container 
towards the conduit. &quot;This should have all the proper tools in it, 
right?&quot; 

The purple-haired Dragoon shrugged. &quot;It should....&quot; he said slowly. 
The speaker replied with a word that drew a dry chuckle from Maze. 
&quot;Hey, it&#39;s not like any of us has bothered to check, you know?&quot; 

&quot;Guess what we&#39;re doing tonight then, assuming we&#39;re still around to 
talk about it,&quot; Tolaris replied with a grunt. He carefully set the 
container on a nearby ledge and examined the hatch over the plasma 
filter housing. &quot;Give me a reading before I open this thing.&quot; 

Maze glanced down at the display panels. &quot;Radiation is at twenty-nine 
on the outside, and still zero on the inside. However, you&#39;re going to 
have to be careful with cracking it open. The sensor web has gotten 
very twitchy all of a sudden, and I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll trigger a level 4 
alarm in short order.&quot; 

Tolaris paused for a moment. &quot;Worst-case scenario, what happens if I 
totally ruin the plasma filter already in there before I take out?&quot; 

&quot;You have pieces everywhere that need to be cleaned out, and the 
system triggers a level 3 alarm about foreign objects inside the 
conduit,&quot; Maze said. &quot;And unless you get all of the fragments out, 
they&#39;ll be swept up in the plasma flow once it starts up again and 
probably wind up in the core chamber.&quot; 

Tolaris got a chill just thinking about it and very carefully began to 
unlock the access hatch. &quot;Let&#39;s just hope that doesn&#39;t happen. We do 
have a vacuum device in here, right?&quot; 

Maze blinked and glanced around the console. &quot;Uh, probably not. I 
think the only vacuum system we have is the emergency venting system, 
and that&#39;s for a coolant leak. I&#39;ll add it to tonight&#39;s list,&quot; he said 
quickly before Tolaris could reply. 

There was a heavy sigh from the speaker, followed by a series of heavy 
clicking noises. &quot;Finished unlocking the panel, opening it now....&quot; 

Three different alarms on the console suddenly flashed red as the 
conduit was opened and exposed to air. The radiation count promptly 
doubled and the display from the sensor web became highly unstable. 
&quot;Rad warning!&quot; Maze yelled into the microphone as he tried to assess 
what was happening. The sensor web display caught his eye and his 
heart skipped a beat. &quot;Get down!&quot; 

Tolaris didn&#39;t hesitate and threw himself on the floor, shielding his 
helmet with his arms. There was a sharp crack as the plasma filter, 
partly ionized by constant exposure to high-energy plasma, reacted 
with the normally stable molecules in the air and combusted, producing 
a miniature explosion. 

The air around Tolaris was immediately filled with a dense fog, a 
result of the automatic fire-suppression system kicking in. The vent 
fans kicked in a moment later, slowly drawing the fog out of the 
reactor room and sending it through a series of air-scrubbers before 
venting it out a small duct outside the cathedral. 

Maze scrambled to keep up with what was happening as a level 3 alarm 
blared around him, the loud klaxon giving him an instant headache. 
Beside him, Myst&#39;s gray fur was standing on end as she looked around 
the room, trying to figure out what was going on. 

&quot;Nak&#39;seth!&quot; Maze yelled at the control panel, hoping that Tolaris had 
gotten around to setting up an audio link to the main computer. 
&quot;Kurush a&#39;vel, s&#39;vaer il&#39;yed ie cha&#39;nak, men&#39;taka Maze Aerce juun juun 
s&#39;ech!&quot; 

Much to his relief, the klaxon immediately fell silent and he could 
feel the vibrations of the reinforced blast doors locking into place 
outside the room. &quot;A&#39;vel kurush&#39;en,&quot; the synthesized voice of the 
computer echoed around the room in a flat monotone. &quot;Il&#39;yed s&#39;vaer&#39;en. 
Il&#39;yan: kesha senn cha&#39;nak il&#39;yan na&#39;e dai&#39;san.&quot; 

&quot;What did it say?&quot; Myst asked as she gave very serious consideration 
to shifting back to the demiplane and finding a place to hide. 

&quot;It did what I asked it to do,&quot; Maze said curtly as he started typing 
away on the console as fast as his fingers would move. 

&quot;Maze?&quot; came the voice from the speaker. 

&quot;Hold still a moment,&quot; Maze said as he scanned and rescanned 
everything he possibly could. &quot;Okay, here&#39;s what I can figure out.... 
the plasma filter was clogged with something really ionized that 
reacted with the air when you opened the hatch.&quot; 

&quot;Radiation?&quot; Tolaris asked as he slowly stood up. 

&quot;Seventy-three outside, six inside your suit, but that outside reading 
is starting to drop. I think it was just an ion burst.&quot; 

&quot;Atmosphere?&quot; he asked next as he noticed the fog in the air and 
suddenly very grateful for his suit&#39;s internal air supply. 

&quot;Uh.... half-second burst of AC-73,&quot; Maze replied, referring to the 
fire suppression compound that inhibited combustion. The only downside 
was that the air was unbreathable until it was totally vented from the 
area. &quot;The system is processing it now, and the scrubbers are taking 
most of the radiation with it. Maybe four points making it outside.&quot; 

Tolaris grunted and carefully peeked into the conduit. &quot;You&#39;re going 
to find this amusing. The filter seems to still be in one piece.&quot; 

&quot;Whisper to Maze,&quot; the speaker said with a faint crackle. 

&quot;You&#39;re right, that is amusing. Just a moment, ma&#39;am, we&#39;re working on 
it. Minor problem with the plasma filter, ion spark,&quot; Maze said 
without taking his eyes off the readings. 

There was a slight pause from the second connection. &quot;The computer 
starts screaming a Level 3 reactor warning, and you say it&#39;s a minor 
problem?&quot; Whisper replied after a moment. 

A hideous crunching noise followed her words as Tolaris yanked the 
remains of the plasma filter from the housing. &quot;Tolaris to Whisper, 
I&#39;m in the reactor room at the moment, and it appears that, ion spark 
aside, everything is well within control.&quot; 

Maze could hear someone asking about what the hell an ion spark was in 
the background before Whisper sighed heavily. &quot;I really hope you do, 
Commander, because I have a few upset guests here and I&#39;m not sure 
what to tell them.&quot; 

&quot;Tell them we&#39;re working on it,&quot; Tolaris suggested. &quot;Maze, how much 
time is left?&quot; 

Maze glanced at a display. &quot;Call it ten minutes by the manual, fifteen 
if we trust the buffer.&quot; 

&quot;What happens after fifteen minutes?&quot; Alex could be heard asking in 
the background. 

&quot;Well, if I&#39;m not done by then, we shut down the reactor and lose 
power until I can get it fixed and restarted,&quot; Tolaris explained as he 
opened the storage container holding the replacement plasma filters. 

Maze just bit his tongue, knowing full well that shutting down the 
reactor was a last-resort option. Then he heard his communicator start 
beeping at a rapid rate, a signal that someone was trying to use the 
Emergency frequency to contact him. He turned his attention away from 
the reactor console only long enough to dig his communicator out of 
his back pocket and glance at the tiny sigil display. 

Oh boy, this is going to be a fun one to explain, he thought as he saw 
the Mercury sigil lit up and blinking rapidly. Sighing heavily, he 
thumbed the connection open and turned his attention back to the 
console. 

&quot;Maze, what&#39;s going on? Why isn&#39;t Tolaris answering me?&quot; Ami&#39;s worried 
image demanded. &quot;And what&#39;s with the reactor?&quot; 

&quot;Well....&quot; Maze said as he composed his thoughts, &quot;It&#39;s like this....&quot;

* 

Ael&#39;ien kept a wary eye over her shoulder as she knocked on the closed 
door to K&#39;tal&#39;s office, watching a very upset Felinoid with 
beautifully soft black fur pace back and forth in front of a control 
console. Everyone else was giving the area a wide berth, making sure 
not to come too close to what was obviously a walking health-hazard. 

The door to the office was yanked open and Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal 
stuck his head out with a very harried look on his face. &quot;Asrial, 
please tell me that.... oh, morning, Captain,&quot; he said, blinking in 
surprise. 

&quot;Trouble?&quot; Ael&#39;ien inquired as she gestured over her shoulder. 

&quot;The uplink to a very crucial satellite is k&#39;vesen,&quot; he replied 
bluntly. &quot;It&#39;s us, not the satellite, so I&#39;ve got Asrial and Ji&#39;an 
working on it. What can I do for you?&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien sighed and held up a message form marked &#39;Eyes Only - 
Division&#39;. &quot;Rune sends her regards. You&#39;re going to love this one.&quot; 

The Dragoon groaned quietly and sagged against the wall for support. 
&quot;I have three different tasking orders for preparations for Nop&#39;tera&#39;s 
arrival, all of which are going to screw up every single field 
exercise I have running, plus I have a mission-critical communication 
problem that supercedes all of that. You&#39;re supposed to be bringing me 
good news, Ael,&quot; he said as he waved her into his office and closed 
the door behind them. 

The telepath gave him a wry look. &quot;You should see what I&#39;ve got to 
deal with,&quot; she said as she handed him the message. 

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; he replied as he scanned the message. &quot;From 
Commanding General, to all division-level and theater commanders, due 
to recent events and the planned arrival.... okay.... okay.... 
wait.... she wants what?&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien sighed and ran her fingers through her hair. &quot;It gets better.&quot; 

K&#39;tal blinked hard as he continued to read the message. &quot;A 
maximum-level defensive systems readiness test to be conducted before 
the arrival of General Nop&#39;tera&#39;s fleet?&quot; he said slowly. &quot;That 
doesn&#39;t sound too bad.&quot; 

&quot;Until you stop and think what you have in your basement here,&quot; 
Ael&#39;ien reminded him. She blinked hard as she could almost hear a 
mental click in his mind, immediately followed by the color draining 
out of his face. 

&quot;Ay&#39;cha navidshi, the cannon!&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien nodded silently. It was widely known that deep inside each of 
the divisional headquarters complexes was an energy weapon capable of 
ripping a sizable hole in a mountain. Each weapon was uniquely 
designed with roughly the same firepower, but required an incredible 
amount of power to use and was not something that could be used 
casually or with any modicum of secrecy. The Dragoon Headquarters 
Complex housed a particle-wave cannon that was one step below a 
full-blown reflex cannon. The fundamental difference was that a very 
precise and powerful orbital mirror could be used to deflect the blast 
from a particle-wave cannon into another trajectory, thus allowing a 
shot to be placed over the visible horizon. 

K&#39;tal sighed heavily. &quot;Let me guess, this dispatch will very shortly 
be in the hands of Internal Review, who will probably come dangerously 
close to wetting themselves in excitement at the prospect of being 
able to throw an immediate and unannounced command-level practice 
exercise.&quot; 

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Ael&#39;ien said with a faint smile. 

&quot;You do know where our orbital mirror is, right?&quot; K&#39;tal added darkly. 

&quot;On the satellite with the bad uplink?&quot; she ventured with a frown. 

&quot;And they say you need to touch a person to read minds.&quot; 

The telepath winced. &quot;So what&#39;s the procedure for this?&quot; 

K&#39;tal sighed and sat down at his desk. &quot;IR is usually very good about 
giving me a five-minute advanced notice message so I can make 
emergency fixes to my schedule and take care of some critical business 
before it kicks off.&quot; 

As if on cue, the printer on his desk began beeping in alarm as it 
began to print out something as fast as it could. The Dragoon 
Commander gave a very dour look to the Psi-Corp Captain as he motioned 
her over to a row of chairs that sat against one wall. &quot;Have a seat, 
Ael, just not near the door,&quot; he said as he grabbed the finished 
printout and wearily cleared off the center of his desk. &quot;As expected, 
a no-notice full-scale cannon exercise, with a courtesy five-minute 
warning to the commander to tie up loose ends. This is going to get 
very interesting and very ugly in a few seconds. Plug your ears for a 
moment,&quot; he added as he sat down. 

Ael&#39;ien gave him an odd look as she did so, then blinked hard as she 
could feel the force of his voice as he bellowed &quot;ASRIAL!!!&quot; through 
the door of his office. The door slammed open a few seconds later and 
the upset Felinoid she saw earlier stormed into the office. The 
Felinoid extended her claws as she leaned over and promptly buried 
them in the surface of the desk, her ears flat against her head and 
her tail lashing back and forth like a whip. 

&quot;What do you want NOW?&quot; Dragoon Lieutenant Asrial demanded furiously. 

Virtually everyone Ael&#39;ien knew, herself included, would have 
immediately thrown the Felinoid into the nearest holding cell for 
gross insubordination and blatant disrespect to a superior officer. 
K&#39;tal, much to her surprise, merely leaned forward and started rubbing 
his hand over her paw. &quot;Asrial, ne&#39;ana,&quot; he cooed quietly, using a 
term of endearment usually reserved for an intimate friend, &quot;We have a 
bit of a crisis on our hands. See this?&quot; he said as he held the 
dispatch up so she could read it. 

Asrial growled dangerously as she started to read the message. She got 
as far as the first sentence before she blinked hard, freezing her 
tail in mid-motion. After a few more moments of reading her tail 
abruptly coiled into a tight helix, looking very much like a 
corkscrew. 

&quot;Yes, now you see my problem,&quot; K&#39;tal said soothingly to her. &quot;I don&#39;t 
suppose you can do anything about this?&quot; 

The Felinoid growled quietly to herself as she pulled her claws free 
from K&#39;tal&#39;s desk and grabbed the message from his hand, her tail 
still frozen in the corkscrew shape as she re-read the message. As 
soon as she finished the message for the second time, she turned 
around and let loose with a very loud and protracted screaming roar 
that made Ael&#39;ien&#39;s hair stand on end. 

She was answered with a much quieter, almost subdued growl of protest 
and a few seconds later another Felinoid walked into the room. Unlike 
Asrial&#39;s black fur, the new arrival&#39;s fur was a deep shade of 
forest-green and banded with black stripes, much like a bengal tiger. 
&quot;Mwwerh?&quot; he growled softly to Asrial as he tried to towel off the 
pink goo that coated his arms up to his elbows. 

Asrial thrust the message at him, holding it a few inches away from 
the tip of his nose. Ji&#39;an continued to try to clean himself as he 
read, halting in mid-motion after he got past the second line. Ael&#39;ien 
had to literally bite the tip of her tongue to keep herself from 
laughing as his tail abruptly coiled into the same tight helix as 
Asrial&#39;s tail had done earlier. 

&quot;We have three minutes before I have to call a general alert,&quot; K&#39;tal 
said calmly. &quot;It will take several minutes for each of the 
phase-transformations, which is about as much time as I can give you. 
So if we don&#39;t have the uplink restored by then, well.... I think 
we&#39;ll all have to find a new line of work.&quot; 

Ji&#39;an turned around and left without saying a word, moving quickly 
back to the control console. Asrial shot K&#39;tal a dark look and growled 
something profane under her breath before tossing the message on his 
desk. She quickly followed the other Felinoid out of the office, 
closing the door with her tail behind her with a sharp bang. 

Ael&#39;ien cleared her throat delicately. &quot;Commander....&quot; she said 
slowly. 

K&#39;tal waved his hand. &quot;Yelling at an already agitated Felinoid is a 
very bad idea, especially when they&#39;re as young and as hot-headed as 
she is. The key to dealing with her is not to react to her temper. 
She&#39;s one of my best computer operators, and admittedly has been under 
quite a lot of pressure this past week, so I allow her temper a little 
leeway. Besides, she knows where the line is at,&quot; he added. 

&quot;And the desk?&quot; she inquired as she leaned over to examine the 
puncture marks in the center. She blinked hard as she realized that 
there were several sets of claw marks on the desk and that the surface 
wasn&#39;t made out of wood as she expected, but a very spongy material. 

&quot;Corkboard,&quot; he explained as he tapped a knuckle on it. &quot;Tolaris came 
up with the idea about forty years ago after she kept perforating his 
in fits of rage. Very easy to replace, very inexpensive, and 
surprisingly sturdy.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien blinked yet again and looked back up at the Dragoon. &quot;You mean 
Commander Tolaris put up with her acting like that?&quot; she said 
incrediously, knowing that Tolaris had a reputation for being a bit on 
the strict side of enforcing rules and regulations. It was common, if 
quiet, knowledge that the Dragoon Legion was composed of some of the 
most eccentric personnel in the military. The sole reason that it was 
overlooked by the highest ranks was due to the simple fact that their 
efficiency and effectiveness was unarguably the best of all the 
divisions. 

K&#39;tal shrugged. &quot;It was messy when she first joined the Legion, but 
after a few confrontations Tolaris was able to reach an understanding 
with her. She kept her temper to a low-volume minimum and tried not to 
destroy anything, and he wouldn&#39;t slam the rule-book on her tail. Like 
I said, she knows where the line is at,&quot; he repeated. 

She just shook her head and made a mental note to have a quiet 
discussion with General Al&#39;vexi about personnel management styles the 
next time she was able to meet with the retired telepath. &quot;Whatever 
works, I suppose,&quot; she said neutrally. 

&quot;Precisely,&quot; K&#39;tal said as he looked at his desk. &quot;Captain, you have 
about sixty seconds to get clear of this place before I have to put 
everything in serious lockdown.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien thought quickly. &quot;You mind having a neutral observer?&quot; 

The Dragoon snorted quietly. &quot;Sure, there&#39;s nothing like having a 
fellow division-level officer around to watch you screw things up 
during a command exercise to make things worthwhile.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll stay out of the way,&quot; the telepath said with a chuckle. 

&quot;You&#39;re so kind,&quot; K&#39;tal said dryly as he made for the door. &quot;Things 
are going to get chaotic in about twenty seconds, so make sure to stay 
as close to me as possible.&quot; 

The door swung open and they stepped out into the main operations 
center of the Dragoon Headquarters Complex. &quot;Status?&quot; K&#39;tal called out 
as he strode into the center of the room. He received an almost 
flatulent growl in reply and sighed quietly. &quot;Just keep at it, 
Lieutenant. Okay, people, time for a proverbial fire drill,&quot; he said 
as he clapped his hands to make sure he had everyone&#39;s attention. &quot;Any 
second now we&#39;re going to get....&quot; 

&quot;Sir,&quot; the communications officer interrupted, &quot;We&#39;re receiving 
Priority One flash traffic from Central Command.&quot; 

&quot;...authority for a test-firing of our particle-wave cannon,&quot; K&#39;tal 
said smoothly as he moved next to the communication console, picked up 
a handset, and keyed the &quot;all-hands&quot; function. 

A three-note electronic whistle sounded throughout the entire complex 
and he began to speak into the handset. &quot;This is Dragoon Commander 
K&#39;tal. All hands to battle stations for a Phase Two evolution and 
firing of the primary cannon. This is an exercise. Chief D&#39;Nina report 
to operations immediately, all other sections chiefs to your Phase Two 
stations. K&#39;tal out.&quot; 

Controlled chaos broke out two seconds later as a flood of reports 
began coming across the data lines. A loud klaxon started going off as 
the lights dimmed and took on a pulsing orange hue. 

&quot;Prepare the complex for the transformation sequence,&quot; K&#39;tal ordered 
as he moved over to an isolated console and powered it up. 

&quot;Prepare complex for sequence, aye sir. Security, recall all perimeter 
personnel and activate containment fields. Engineering....&quot; 

&quot;Containment fields initializing....&quot; 

&quot;D&#39;Nina to Operations, I&#39;m on my way. Just don&#39;t close the Junction 
Seven bulkheads on me and I&#39;ll be there in four minutes.&quot; 

&quot;...reactor status and prepare to release the interlocks on the 
primary systems. Communications, sever datalinks....&quot; 

&quot;Reactor Two is spooling up, estimating active status in five minutes, 
reactors One and Three are being restarted...&quot; 

&quot;...perimeter secured, all personnel accounted for....&quot; 

&quot;...all orbital uplinks, resynchronize as necessary.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering to Station Seven, confirm status....&quot; 

&quot;Sir, the uplinks to Pri&#39;va and T&#39;Cer are active, still attempting to 
resync with Rasche, still no signal from Essence....&quot; 

&quot;Rrrrrrwwwwwwaaaaaaaahhhhhllllll!&quot; 

&quot;Mwwerh?&quot; 

&quot;GGGGHHHAAAAANNNNNNOOOWWWWWLLLL!!!&quot; 

&quot;Not so loud, Asrial,&quot; K&#39;tal admonished as he confirmed to the central 
computer that he was who he claimed to be, that he did have the 
authority to change the Dragoon complex&#39;s defensive status, and that, 
yes, he did desire to do so at this very moment. 

&quot;Station Seven, sector is clear....&quot; 

&quot;...Reactor Two output is ramping up, power level now at 45.&quot; 

&quot;...External containment fields online. Bulkheads at Junctions One, 
Two, Five, and Eight have closed.&quot; 

&quot;...Synchronization with Rasche completed, system is responding.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering to Commander K&#39;tal.&quot; 

&quot;Prrrran.&quot; 

&quot;WHAT? Grrrrrrrrah! Bypass it!&quot; 

&quot;Commander K&#39;tal here.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, do you want a dry-firing for this exercise, or do we have a nice 
spot in the sand picked out for a round?&quot; 

&quot;Prrrrkeeeeeet?&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t CARE how, just bypass the v&#39;tek&#39;ka thing!&quot; 

&quot;Sulaaaaaaacht.&quot; 

&quot;Now there&#39;s a thought,&quot; K&#39;tal mused quietly as he glanced over his 
left shoulder as the door hissed open to admit the stooped figure of 
Chief D&#39;Nina into Operations. &quot;Stand by for a moment.&quot; 

&quot;Venta.&quot; 

&quot;Somebody spike the ma&#39;cha with le&#39;un berries again?&quot; D&#39;Nina observed 
as she stepped next to K&#39;tal and keyed active her own command ciphers. 
Although not an officer, her rank was based on her technial expertise 
and proficiency, thus making her a suitable counterpart for the 
two-person authority needed to initiate the complex&#39;s transformation 
sequence. The fact that she was also a very critical component of the 
final sequence made the selection of her as the secondary authority 
all the easier. 

&quot;...All remaining bulkhead junctions have closed, the Complex is 
sealed.&quot; 

&quot;...Reactor Two still ramping up, now reading 145.&quot; 

&quot;Chief, have you met Psi-Corp Captain Ael&#39;ien before?&quot; 

&quot;No, but I figure it can wait,&quot; D&#39;Nina replied. &quot;Due respect, ma&#39;am,&quot; 
she added to the telepath with a quick nod of her head. 

Ael&#39;ien almost smiled. &quot;Perfectly understandable, Chief,&quot; she replied 
as she wondered just how old the chief was. She looked to be pushing 
seventeen hundred, but it was rather difficult to tell any given 
denizen&#39;s age. 

&quot;Live fire, D&#39;Nina, or we just fake it?&quot; K&#39;tal asked without preamble. 

&quot;With Nop&#39;tera&#39;s carrier out there somewhere? Fire that thing for real 
and we might have a real close look at that new tactical warhead.&quot; 

K&#39;tal cringed slightly. &quot;Good enough for me. K&#39;tal to Engineering.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering.&quot; 

&quot;Dry-fire. Pull the primary back and lock the housing open.&quot; 

&quot;Dry firing, understood. Engineering out.&quot; 

&quot;...Reactor Two output now above 200, power systems are ready for 
Phase One sequence.&quot; 

&quot;Asrial?&quot; K&#39;tal ventured. 

&quot;BRRRRRAAAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!&quot; 

K&#39;tal sighed quietly. &quot;What&#39;s the problem, ne&#39;ana?&quot; 

&quot;Fused data conduit in the crypto-linker,&quot; the Felinoid growled. &quot;It&#39;s 
jammed in the open position. Trying to bypass it now.&quot; 

&quot;Umm, sir...?&quot;



K&#39;tal just sighed quietly to himself as he glanced over his shoulder 
at the communications officer. &quot;It always has to be something,&quot; he 
muttered under his breath to Ael&#39;ien. &quot;What is it, Lieutenant?&quot; 

The lieutenant held up the priority message from Central Command. &quot;It 
says in the orders that we&#39;re to use a live round for the cannon, and 
they&#39;ve given us the targeting information.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s convenient,&quot; K&#39;tal said absently as he turned around to share 
an even look with D&#39;Nina. &quot;Opinion?&quot; he asked quietly. 

Ael&#39;ien blinked at the question. She rarely asked for the opinions of 
other senior officers about clear-cut orders from Central Command, and 
the idea of asking an enlisted chief, even a senior one, was almost 
shocking. 

&quot;Bothersome, but nothing I&#39;ll lose any sleep over,&quot; D&#39;Nina shrugged. 

&quot;System status?&quot; K&#39;tal called out. 

&quot;Communications are Phase One ready.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering is Phase One ready.&quot; 

&quot;Security is Phase One ready.&quot; 

&quot;All stations manned, all personnel accounted for.&quot; 

&quot;Tactical computer node is online and ready.&quot; 

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; K&#39;tal replied and turned to the isolated computer 
console he and D&#39;Nina were keyed into. &quot;Recognize Dragoon K&#39;tal, 
commander, primary authority for phase transformation.&quot; 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized,&quot; the computer responded in a flat monotone. 

&quot;Initiate Phase One transformation sequence,&quot; he said loudly, so that 
both the computer and the rest of Operations could hear him. 

&quot;Require concurrence,&quot; the computer replied. 

D&#39;Nina cleared her throat. &quot;Recognize Dragoon D&#39;Nina, master chief, 
secondary authority for phase transformation.&quot; 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized.&quot; 

&quot;Initiate Phase One transformation sequence,&quot; she said forcefully. 

&quot;Compliance,&quot; the computer responded and began to generate a series of 
digital signals that flowed through a special series of data conduits.

Molly glanced around the crowded school hallway, trying to spot either 
Serena or someone who knew where she was. With a unique hairstyle like 
hers, she thought as she continued to search the hallways, you&#39;d think 
that she would stick out like a sore thumb. And speaking of sore 
thumbs.... 

&quot;Oh, hi, Molly!&quot; a voice called out from in front of her. 

&quot;Melvin, have you seen Serena?&quot; Molly asked without preamble. 

Melvin blinked behind his oversized glasses. &quot;No, I haven&#39;t. Why, is 
she in trouble again?&quot; 

The redhead sighed. &quot;No, I just need to tell her that Luna followed 
her to school for some reason. If the school officials find out, 
they&#39;ll have a fit,&quot; she explained. 

&quot;Huh, Luna followed her to school?&quot; Melvin repeated as he blinked 
again. 

I see he forgot to have his brain follow him to school, Molly thought 
to herself with a patient sigh. &quot;Yes, Melvin, she&#39;s prowling around 
outside, so do you know where Serena is?&quot; 

&quot;No, but we can ask Ami, she might know,&quot; the school gossip replied as 
he pointed over Molly&#39;s shoulder. &quot;She looks like she&#39;s heading this 
way, and boy does she look mad about something.&quot; 

Molly glanced over her shoulder and suddenly wished she hadn&#39;t. She 
had known Ami for quite some time now, but had rarely seen her looking 
as angry as she did now. If that look were on Leda&#39;s face, she 
thought, the hallway would have been cleared out by now. 

As it was, people were noticing the dark look on Ami&#39;s face and were 
doing their best to make a path for her. &quot;Melvin, we need to talk,&quot; 
she said flatly when she reached the spot next to Molly. 

&quot;Uh, sure, Ami,&quot; he stuttered as he broke out in a cold sweat. 

Molly suddenly wasn&#39;t feeling too good herself as she suddenly 
remembered the newest piece of gossip making its way around Melvin&#39;s 
grapevine network of rumors. This might get ugly if it&#39;s about her 
boyfriend.... 

&quot;I don&#39;t know why you persist in spreading rumors about people and 
their social lives,&quot; Ami growled, &quot;But you need to leave me and my 
friends out of it. It&#39;s both unbecoming and highly inaccurate....&quot; 

Her tirade was interrupted as a stocky girl with dirty blonde hair 
walked up next to her and leaned against the lockers with a heavy 
thump. &quot;Oh, look, bookworms,&quot; she cooed with a sneer. &quot;And they&#39;re 
fighting, how cute....&quot; 

Ami glanced at the new arrival before returning her focus to Melvin. 
&quot;As I was saying,&quot; she continued, &quot;Engaging in baseless slander is 
something only weak-minded individuals indulge in. I honestly expected 
better of someone with a modicum of intelligence like you.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, my, she&#39;s pissed about something,&quot; the girl observed loudly. 
&quot;Wonder what got her panties in a bunch? A boyfriend, maybe?&quot; 

Both Molly and Melvin blinked hard as Ami turned back to her and the 
surrounding air temperature seemed to drop by about forty degrees. &quot;Is 
there something I can help you with?&quot; Ami asked in an edged tone. 

&quot;Yeah, you can tell us what it&#39;s like to date someone who&#39;s old enough 
to be your father,&quot; the girl replied with a cruel smile. &quot;Kinda gives 
new meaning to the phrase &#39;Who&#39;s yer daddy?&#39;&quot; 

Molly felt her breath jam in her throat as she noticed the raw tension 
in Ami&#39;s shoulders. Oh, lord, please don&#39;t let her go off, she 
thought, her mind flashing back to the scene on the bus the other day 
where Ami revealed she had martial arts training. She saw motion out 
of the corner of her eye and turned briefly to look, her eyes going 
wide at what she saw. Oh, no, not now.... 

Ami considered her options briefly before smirking. &quot;At least I know 
who my father was,&quot; she shot back. &quot;Has your mother sorted out all the 
trash in the trailer park yet?&quot; 

The girl&#39;s eyes blazed at the insult while Melvin&#39;s jaw sagged open 
and Molly almost keeled over on the spot from shock. &quot;Let me tell you 
something, little bookworm,&quot; the blonde hissed as she grabbed Ami&#39;s 
arm. The grip lasted for half a second before someone grabbed her by 
the shoulder and tossed her back against the lockers. &quot;Hey, this ain&#39;t 
no petting zoo,&quot; a voice growled, &quot;Hands off the bookworms.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re in for it now, sister,&quot; the girl snarled as she lunged forward 
and found herself nose-to-nose with her new adversary. The shock of 
recognition caused her to go pale and produced a silence that 
stretched on for what seemed to be a minor eternity. 

&quot;Well, well, well, what have we here?&quot; her opponent said languidly as 
she slowly broke into a smug smile. 

&quot;L-L-L-Leda!&quot; the girl stammered as she broke out into a cold sweat. 

&quot;Amanda Parkins, so good to see you again,&quot; Leda drawled with what 
some might have called a predatory grin as she took a firm grip on the 
blonde&#39;s wrist. &quot;Let me give you a nice welcome to my school, seeing 
how you&#39;re still a trouble-making little tart....&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not what you think,&quot; Amanda replied hastily as she looked for a 
way out of the impending scuffle that she knew she would most likely 
lose. 

&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Leda said casually as she looked around at the assembled 
group. &quot;Funny, it looks like you were harassing my best friend.&quot; 

Amanda&#39;s face turned even paler. &quot;Your best friend?&quot; she said weakly. 

&quot;Hey, Ami, did I ever introduce you to my favorite peon punching bag 
from my old school?&quot; Leda said as she continued to relish the thought 
of being able to intimidate her former classmate and rival. 

&quot;We&#39;ve just met,&quot; Ami said in a voice as dry as most desert regions. 

&quot;Best friend, like Jenni?&quot; Amanda said without thinking. Her mistake 
was made quite obvious by the sudden flash of pure rage in Leda&#39;s 
green eyes that caused everyone else to flinch in the fear of a 
nuclear outburst of temper. 

Leda grabbed the front of her rival&#39;s blouse with both hands and 
yanked her up almost entirely off the ground. &quot;You have something to 
say about the dearly departed?&quot; she said in a very soft tone, her 
whole body taut with barely contained rage as the blonde tried to keep 
her balance on her tip-toes. 

Molly felt the color draining from her face as she witnessed the 
events unfolding around her. She generally tried to avoid being 
anywhere near one of Leda&#39;s tempermental outbursts, but she knew 
enough to realize that the most dangerous fits was when her voice 
turned quiet. She glanced to her side and saw that Melvin was as white 
as a sheet. Hopefully he&#39;ll learn something from this, she thought to 
herself. 

&quot;Leda,&quot; Ami said quietly as she watched Amanda struggle for air. 

The brunette ignored her and kept her focus on the blonde. &quot;Well?&quot; 

&quot;Back off, cupcake,&quot; Amanda wheezed, &quot;Just because I never snuggled up 
to her like you did doesn&#39;t mean I wasn&#39;t her friend as well. 
Remember?&quot; 

Leda glared at her for a few seconds before releasing her grip. Amanda 
rocked back on her heels as she fought to keep her balance and breathe 
at the same time. &quot;I remember,&quot; Leda replied acidly. 

The blonde coughed lightly and rubbed her neck. &quot;Damn, you been 
lifting weights or something?&quot; 

&quot;So I take it you two know each other?&quot; Melvin ventured carefully. 

Leda smirked and put her arm around Amanda&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Oh, sure, 
we&#39;ve known each other for years, haven&#39;t we?&quot; she said darkly as she 
squeezed hard and pulled her close until their shoulders ground 
against one another. 

&quot;Something like that,&quot; Amanda muttered through gritted teeth. 

&quot;Leda,&quot; Ami said quietly again with a patient sigh. 

&quot;What?&quot; 

Ami sighed again. &quot;Are you finished?&quot; 

Leda raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;Not overly glad to see me, are you?&quot; 

&quot;I can take care of myself, you know,&quot; Ami replied. &quot;I might not have 
your skill at martial arts, but there are other ways to defend 
oneself.&quot; 

&quot;Like tossing a childish insult back?&quot; Leda observed lightly. 

&quot;Just what I was thinking,&quot; Amanda muttered as she tried to pry 
herself free from Leda&#39;s iron grip. She grunted as Leda&#39;s foot came 
down hard on her toes in a quick stomp. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think you realize your situation, pop-tart,&quot; Leda replied 
with an edge to her voice, &quot;So let me explain this one to you. First 
and foremost, Ami is my best friend and you were harassing her. That 
alone is good enough for me to kick you into next week. Second of all, 
you really picked the wrong person to harass. Ami looks harmless, and 
I&#39;ll admit that the bookworm image of her&#39;s doesn&#39;t help much, but she 
can be worse than I am when she gets mad.&quot; 

The blonde cast a sidelong glance at the brunette. &quot;Worse, eh?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah. Watch out for her, she bites,&quot; Leda replied evenly. &quot;Hard.&quot; 

&quot;That explain that little nibble mark on your neck?&quot; Amanda inquired. 

Molly just closed her eyes as Leda became a sudden blur of motion. 
There was the expected impact noise, but it sounded differently enough 
that she very carefully opened her eyes to see what had happened. 

Leda&#39;s punch had been intercepted by Ami&#39;s hand about an inch in front 
of Amanda&#39;s face. The blonde&#39;s eyes were the size of dinner plates as 
her mind caught up to the events around her. Melvin&#39;s eyes were 
likewise wide with shock and almost visible around the edges of his 
glasses. But what bothered Molly the most was the look in Ami&#39;s 
steel-blue eyes, a sort of dark glare that she couldn&#39;t remember ever 
seeing in anyone&#39;s eyes before. 

&quot;She&#39;s not worth it,&quot; Ami said flatly. 

&quot;You my mother or something?&quot; Leda growled as she pulled her fist 
back. 

&quot;No, just your best friend.&quot; 

The brunette paused for a long moment before sighing heavily through 
her nose. &quot;Fine, you deal with the little hellion,&quot; she grumbled as 
she leaned against the lockers with a heavy thump. 

Ami turned to face the suddenly leery blonde. &quot;Yes, I am Leda&#39;s best 
friend, no, we&#39;re not intimately involved, yes, I have a boyfriend who 
is older than I am. Is that sufficient?&quot; she asked evenly. 

Everyone blinked hard at the sudden confession. &quot;Why?&quot; Amanda asked as 
she tried to calm herself down from her brush with physical injury. 

&quot;Pay attention, because I&#39;m not repeating myself,&quot; Ami told Melvin in 
a glacial tone before turning her attention back to Amanda. &quot;I need 
someone who can keep up with me. Someone who is capable of discussing 
things on a mature and intellectual level. Someone who knows about and 
keeps up with the news, both local and global. Someone who can hold a 
conversation about celestial mechanics or biological science or 
physics or some other topic that often seems complicated to those who 
haven&#39;t educated themselves about the higher sciences yet. Look 
around, do you think any mere school-boy can offer that?&quot; Ami said in 
an even tone. 

&quot;You don&#39;t ask for much, do you?&quot; Leda muttered, drawing a dark look. 

&quot;Would you prefer I have your standards?&quot; Ami shot back. 

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Leda sighed as she leaned back against the lockers. 

Amanda blinked and looked around her. &quot;Well, seeing how you put it 
like that, I guess we can&#39;t blame you....&quot; she said slowly, trying to 
gauge the reaction to her words. 

&quot;Yet you still find it amusing?&quot; Ami replied evenly. &quot;I don&#39;t flaunt 
my social life or lack thereof, as others have put it. I&#39;m guessing 
your past is as checkered as Leda&#39;s?&quot; 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Leda protested. 

The blonde sighed quietly. &quot;Probably,&quot; she muttered. 

&quot;Worry about tending to the flaws in yourself before you start prying 
into the business of others, please,&quot; Ami said calmly. &quot;You might 
discover that in doing so you will find things of value that will make 
others seek you out for friendship instead of you having to try to 
find them.&quot; 

Amanda blinked and looked at Ami for a moment before nodding. &quot;I&#39;ll 
try to keep that in mind. Just one more question.&quot; 

Ami raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes?&quot; 

The blonde jerked her thumb over her slightly bruised shoulder. &quot;How 
is it that a piece of work like you got to be best friends with a 
rabid wombat?&quot; she asked as she gestured at Leda. That prompted a 
growl from the brunette that was silenced by a dark look from Ami. 

&quot;It&#39;s simple,&quot; she replied after thinking carefully. &quot;I looked past 
the aggressive posturing and saw what she was like inside. All she 
needed was to be smacked upside the head to realize that some people 
do care about her for who she is now instead of what she once was.&quot; 

Amanda blinked hard and glanced back at Leda for a moment. Leda glared 
at her for a moment before looking around the hallway, noticing the 
sizable crowd that had gathered to watch. &quot;Somebody have something to 
say?&quot; she said loudly in an edged tone. 

The hallway emptied in twenty seconds, leaving only Leda, Amanda, Ami, 
Melvin, and Molly gathered together in a small bunch. 

Amanda blew her breath out quietly. &quot;I see you&#39;re still the queen of 
clearing a room out,&quot; she observed. 

&quot;What good is a reputation if you don&#39;t make use of it?&quot; Leda replied. 

&quot;I see some things haven&#39;t changed,&quot; the blonde said with a smirk. 

Leda shrugged. &quot;Why should they? Hold still, I don&#39;t think she&#39;s done 
with you yet,&quot; she said as she reached out to snag the back of 
Melvin&#39;s shirt as he tried to sneak away. 

&quot;I was just heading back to class....&quot; Melvin said in a shaky voice. 

&quot;Sit. Stay. Good bookworm,&quot; Leda said with a glare before turning back 
to Amanda. &quot;You, on the other hand, need to take a hike.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Amanda replied as she turned to leave. She paused 
for a moment and turned back to Leda. &quot;About that mark on your 
neck....&quot; 

&quot;Grease burn,&quot; Leda replied flatly as she tugged her collar down to 
expose the dark splotch on her throat. 

&quot;Ouch,&quot; the blonde said as she studied the mark for a moment. &quot;You 
should be more careful.&quot; 

&quot;Look who&#39;s talking, mouth,&quot; Leda replied as she released her collar 
and glared at her long-time adversary. &quot;Do us both a favor and leave 
my friends alone, okay? Otherwise I&#39;d have to reintroduce my foot to 
your fat....&quot; 

&quot;I get the picture,&quot; Amanda interrupted with an edged tone. &quot;So nice 
to see you too. Anyway, it&#39;s been a blast, but I need to go now. Have 
fun,&quot; she said with a wave before vanishing around a corner. 

&quot;What are we going to do with you?&quot; Ami asked wearily. 

Leda snorted. &quot;Don&#39;t ask me that because you know I&#39;ll tell you 
exactly what you can do with me. And vice versa.&quot; 

Molly blinked hard as she glanced back and forth between the two of 
them, not entirely sure what to make of that last exchange. She 
glanced over at Melvin and noticed that he had a &quot;go figure&quot; look on 
his face as well. Maybe one of these days I&#39;ll have this all sorted 
out, she thought with a mental sigh. 

&quot;Melvin,&quot; Ami said in a neutral tone. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; he replied as he started to sweat again. 

&quot;It would be in everybody&#39;s best interests if nothing was ever said or 
repeated about this incident,&quot; Ami said very slowly. &quot;That includes 
any more information about my social life. Your penchant for gossip 
has caused enough trouble as it is. Do you understand?&quot; 

&quot;Perfectly,&quot; Melvin squeaked in a high-pitched voice. 

&quot;Good,&quot; Ami said with a small sigh of relief. 

&quot;Now get out of our sight,&quot; Leda growled at the school gossip. Melvin 
took the overt hint and made a very rapid exit, disappearing down the 
same corridor that Amanda had used moments earlier. 

&quot;That boy annoys me,&quot; Leda grumbled. 

&quot;Was that really necessary?&quot; Ami inquired as she leaned against the 
bank of lockers and rubbed her forehead. She could already feel the 
beginnings of a tension headache taking up residence in her frontal 
lobes and wondered how long it would be before it went away. 

&quot;Ami, in case you hadn&#39;t noticed, he was more afraid of you than me,&quot; 
Leda observed with a smirk. &quot;He about wet himself every time you 
glared at him.&quot; 

Ami ignored her and turned her attention to the still-pale Molly. &quot;Is 
something wrong, Molly? You looked like you had something on your mind 
even before this nonsense happened.&quot; 

The redhead blinked. &quot;What? Oh, yes, I was wondering if either of you 
knew where Serena was. Her cat followed her to school and I&#39;m worried 
about school officials finding her prowling around outside.&quot; 

Ami and Leda exchanged discreet glances. &quot;Luna is outside?&quot; Leda asked 
carefully as Ami looked for the nearest exit to the schoolyard. 

&quot;Yes, last I saw she was perched on that large oak tree,&quot; Molly 
explained. 

Leda and Ami exchanged glances again and both breathed a silent sigh 
of relief. It had been discussed awhile ago that in case of a 
situation in which their communicators couldn&#39;t be used, either Luna 
or Aretmis would be sitting out in the open on the playground 
equipment. However, if they were seen around any of the large trees, 
it meant that the information wasn&#39;t a high priority. 

&quot;We&#39;ll keep an eye out for Serena,&quot; Ami promised. 

Molly nodded. &quot;Okay, thank you. Hey, we better get to class or we&#39;ll 
be late.&quot; 

Leda smirked. &quot;You go on ahead, I&#39;ve got to have a word with Ami for a 
moment,&quot; she said, drawing a very wary look from the blue-haired 
student. 

Molly blinked before she shrugged. &quot;Okay, see you later,&quot; she said and 
quickly made her way down the nearly empty corridor. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami asked warily. 

&quot;All I needed was to be smacked upside the head, huh?&quot; Leda mimicked 
with a lopsided smirk. &quot;Gee, some friend you are.&quot; 

Ami just sighed and rubbed her temples. &quot;Save it for later, okay? I&#39;ve 
got a headache now, plus I&#39;m worried about what Luna wants.&quot; 

Leda shrugged. &quot;If she&#39;s on the tree, it can wait until lunchtime.&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s hope it doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the reactor,&quot; Ami said 
with another quiet sigh as she gathered her books together and started 
walking to her next class. 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t we have felt the explosion if it did?&quot; Leda inquired as she 
fell into step next to her best friend. 

Ami shivered. &quot;If the reactor lost containment, we might be lucky 
enough to see the flash for a microsecond before the entire city gets 
taken off the map,&quot; she replied in a voice that quite clearly conveyed 
her feelings. 

Leda blinked hard. &quot;Hold it, back up a second. You&#39;re saying that the 
reactor in the cathedral is powerful enough to wipe out the whole city 
if it ever blew up?&quot; 

&quot;Unfortunately, yes.&quot; 

The brunette fell silent as she contemplated the new information as 
they quickly made their way to class. &quot;How long have you known about 
this?&quot; she asked just as they were about to enter the classroom. 

&quot;Long enough to be able to sleep peacefully at night now,&quot; Ami 
replied. 

&quot;Great, now I&#39;m worried,&quot; Leda said with a heavy sigh. 

Ami gave her a wry smile. &quot;Don&#39;t be. Like I said, if the reactor ever 
lost containment, it would be over in an instant. We probably wouldn&#39;t 
even be able to feel it.&quot; 

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Leda sighed as they entered the classroom moments before the 
tardy bell rang. &quot;Yeah, conversation at lunch should be 
interesting....&quot;

The Dragoon Headquarters Complex was a fairly large building, composed 
of a central axis bisected by three parallel lines, much like a pair 
of capital E&#39;s merged together at the spine. Its size was deceptive, 
seeming to stand only three stories high when viewed from ground level 
when in fact it extended almost seven stories underground. Some 
speculated this was merely to reduce the exposure of the complex to 
above-ground attacks, although there were rumors that the lower levels 
housed something more than the power systems for the particle-wave 
cannon. 

The first visible change to the complex&#39;s exterior was a network of 
armor plates unfolding from hidden housings. The plates began to 
spread out like the petals of steel flowers, primarily locking into 
place over the windows, air vents, and external infrastructure 
junctions with echoing booms. 

Several circular panels irised open at seemingly random locations 
along the length of the complex, allowing a series of diamond-shaped 
generators to protrude into the open air. Tiny motes of energy started 
to flow through the delicate circuitry along their flat surfaces, 
giving them the appearance of glowing, glittering spiderwebs. 

A massive crack appeared on top of the complex, quicking becoming a 
deep crevice as the two halves of the roof seemed to fold inward on 
themselves. The opening only lasted a few seconds before a massive 
weapons platform rose up to take the place of the roof. The weapons 
themselves began to unfold and extend as power began to flow into the 
conduits, revealing a wide array of missile batteries, anti-aircraft 
weapontry, sensors, and plasma cannons. 

The diamond-shaped generators began to emit bubbles of electromagnetic 
energy as they became fully charged, slowly growing in size like 
translucent balloons until they started to press against each other. 
The energy shields quickly organized themselves into a honeycomb shape 
that coated the entire complex with a protective layer of crackling 
energy. 

Deep inside the complex, dozens of blast-resistant bulkheads slid into 
place around doorways and corridor junctions, further sealing off 
non-critical sections and providing an extra layer of containment from 
both external and internal events. The outside air vents sealed shut 
and a network of fans began to circulate the air supply through a 
series of filters, cutting off the complex from any external 
atmospheric threat. 

&quot;Phase One transformation completed,&quot; the computer reported in the 
usual dry monotone. 

&quot;Well, that&#39;s good to hear,&quot; K&#39;tal replied. 

&quot;Sir, we&#39;re receiving a coded signal from Essence,&quot; the Communications 
lieutenant reported, &quot;You&#39;ll need to use your ciphers to authorize the 
system to process it.&quot; 

&quot;Navidshi,&quot; Asrial spat over her shoulder from the damaged console. 

K&#39;tal shot her a dark look. &quot;That&#39;s not the usual procedure, is it?&quot; 
he inquired as he turned his attention back to his own panel. 

&quot;Not usually, sir,&quot; the lieutenant replied with a shake of her head, 
&quot;But we&#39;re trying to establish a new encryption link instead of 
re-establishing an old one, and that requires command-level approval.&quot; 

&quot;Nonsense, you don&#39;t have the satellite signal,&quot; Asrial growled. 

The Communications officer blinked hard. &quot;No, I have the satellite,&quot; 
she countered. &quot;I&#39;ve already double-checked the signal algorithms and 
the data path. It&#39;s coming from the precise coordinates as the Essence 
satellite and with the exact same timing sequence,&quot; she explained as 
she transferred her console display to the main center screen. &quot;See?&quot; 

The Felinoid growled as she looked over the display. &quot;And I&#39;m telling 
you that what you have can&#39;t be the satellite. You must have your head 
up your...&quot; 

&quot;Asrial,&quot; K&#39;tal said flatly. 

&quot;It&#39;s not the satellite,&quot; she spat. &quot;The data path is invalid.&quot; 

&quot;I just verified the path ten seconds ago for the fourth time,&quot; the 
young Communications lieutenant shot back with an edge to her own 
voice, shrugging off the warning nudge from a fellow technician. 

&quot;Enough, people,&quot; K&#39;tal sighed as he re-read the display yet again. 
&quot;It looks like a valid signal to me. Let&#39;s see what the computer 
says,&quot; he said as he typed in a command to his terminal. 

&quot;I&#39;m telling you that it&#39;s not the satellite,&quot; Asrial growled even 
louder. 

&quot;Asrial, if you yell at me again I&#39;ll have you tossed in the brig,&quot; 
the Dragoon commander replied flatly with a warning glare at the 
Felinoid. &quot;Now bite your tongue or it will be bitten for you. Is that 
clear, Lieutenant?&quot; 

&quot;Clear, sir,&quot; Asrial replied in a neutral tone. 

&quot;Algorithm accepted,&quot; the computer announced in a flat monotone. 

&quot;Well?&quot; K&#39;tal said to the Communications lieutenant. 

&quot;Systems are synchronizing with Essence,&quot; she reported smugly. 

&quot;Commander,&quot; D&#39;Nina said very quietly. 

&quot;Hold that thought, Chief,&quot; K&#39;tal whispered back to her just as 
quietly. 

&quot;Synchronization complete.&quot; 

&quot;K&#39;tal to Engineering.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering, we see it, sir,&quot; the speaker replied. &quot;The targeting 
lasers have acquired the mirror and are calibrating now.&quot; 

K&#39;tal nodded to the microphone. &quot;Change of plans, Chief. We&#39;re going 
to use a live round for this one.&quot; 

&quot;Live round, aye sir. The housing will be available as soon as we make 
the Phase Two evolution.&quot; 

&quot;Carry on, Chief. K&#39;tal out,&quot; the Dragoon said as he flicked off the 
microphone. &quot;Tactical, have we got those firing coordinates yet?&quot; 

&quot;Already in the system, sir,&quot; the Tactical officer replied. 

&quot;System status?&quot; 

&quot;Communications are Phase Two ready.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering is Phase Two ready, optimal firing window in ten 
minutes.&quot; 

&quot;Tactical is Phase Two ready.&quot; 

&quot;Weapons are in stand-by mode and are Phase Two ready.&quot; 

&quot;Security is Phase Two ready, defensive shields fully energized.&quot; 

&quot;Commander....&quot; Asrial pleaded in an usually quiet tone. 

K&#39;tal rubbed his forehead. &quot;I haven&#39;t forgotten you, Asrial, but as 
you can see, that really is the satellite.&quot; 

&quot;The satellite, yes, but not the on-board computer,&quot; Asrial replied. 
&quot;It is a physical impossibility for us to be in contact with it.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander paused and exchanged a slightly concerned glance 
with D&#39;Nina. &quot;Okay, Lieutenant, tell me why,&quot; he said warily. 

Asrial reached into the console she was working on and picked up a 
loose circuit board. &quot;Not only is the crypto-linker still off-line, 
but the signal wave guide and processing matrix aren&#39;t even 
connected.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; the Communications lieutenant gasped as she turned her 
attention to her console. &quot;But I&#39;ve verified the data path! That has 
to be from the satellite as there is NOTHING else around it!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s not coming from the satellite,&quot; Asrial argued, 
&quot;I&#39;m saying it&#39;s not from the satellite&#39;s computer!&quot; 

&quot;Then what am I connected to?&quot; the lieutenant demanded. 

&quot;How should I know?&quot; the Felinoid growled back. &quot;I just know what it&#39;s 
NOT coming from.&quot; 

&quot;D&#39;Nina, do you have as much of a bad feeling about this as I do?&quot; 
K&#39;tal said quietly to his second-in-command. 

The elder Dragoon grunted in reply. &quot;I&#39;ve been having bad feelings 
about everything since they exiled Tolaris,&quot; she said. &quot;We can&#39;t stall 
for time to hash this out, unfortunately.&quot; 

&quot;So make the evolution?&quot; K&#39;tal asked. 

Captain Ael&#39;ien had to literally bite the tip of her tongue in an 
effort to keep herself from lashing out at the Dragoon. You&#39;re 
supposed to be the one making the decisions, K&#39;tal, she thought 
angrily to herself. If this is how the command structure has 
degenerated, then perhaps I need to have a very long talk with both 
Al&#39;vexi and General Rune. 

&quot;Yes, unless you have a substantiated reason for calling off a 
mandated exercise and printed instructions from Central Command,&quot; the 
master chief said with a mild shrug. 

K&#39;tal thought quietly for a moment. &quot;Not yet,&quot; he admitted. &quot;Computer, 
initiate Phase Two transformation sequence,&quot; he said loudly to his 
command console. 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized. Require concurrence,&quot; the computer replied. 

D&#39;Nina hesitated for a moment and cast a glance at K&#39;tal. &quot;You&#39;re 
right, I probably do have a worse-than-usual bad feeling about this. 
Computer, initiate Phase Two transformation sequence.&quot; 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized. Compliance....&quot;

* 

Her skin tingled with energy as she entered the flow of Time and began 
to navigate the temporal currents with practiced ease, slipping from 
one physical location to another in a cosmic instant. She knew of 
several ways to compare the flow of Time in other, more easily 
understood concepts when attempting to explain it to the uninitiated, 
but her personal favorite was that of a vast river with countless 
eddies and currents. 

A conduit opened before her and she slipped into it, her physical body 
reforming in normal four-dimensional space with a brief flash of 
light. She waited for a moment for the residual temporal energy to 
drain away before she opened her eyes and looked around the small 
chamber she relocated into. 

&quot;I must say, you have excellent timing,&quot; a soft voice said from 
directly behind her. 

Susan blinked and glanced over her shoulder. &quot;I am the Guardian of 
Time,&quot; she said evenly. &quot;I&#39;m supposed to have good timing. Why are you 
here?&quot; 

Megan smiled and stretched her wings. &quot;I was waiting for you.&quot; 

&quot;That much is obvious,&quot; Susan observed as she set her staff aside and 
began to undress. &quot;Is there something I should be made aware of before 
I go see Lord Hades?&quot; 

The full-blooded succubus blinked and the pair of tiny bat-like wings 
on her head fluttered nervously. &quot;My, you&#39;re in a testy mood about 
something.&quot; 

&quot;This is my keep,&quot; Susan replied archly as she stepped out of her 
dress and slipped her panties off. &quot;I know you&#39;re an emmisary and all, 
but I think trespassing is a bit uncalled for.&quot; 

Megan raised a slender eyebrow. &quot;This keep belongs to your father,&quot; 
she corrected Susan as she opened a closet and pulled out a long black 
ribbon that was almost identical to the one she was wearing. 

Susan gave the other succubus a mild look. &quot;Your point?&quot; 

&quot;I have his full permission to use this keep as I see fit, just as you 
do, Setsuna,&quot; Megan replied as she gave Susan&#39;s body an apprasing look 
before she put the black ribbon back in the closet and picked up a 
dark blue one. She held it against Susan&#39;s bare skin for a moment 
before nodding and began to wrap it around Susan&#39;s slender hips. 

Susan took a step back and scowled at her unexpected guest. &quot;Just who 
exactly are you, and how do you know my true-name?&quot; she demanded. 

Megan paused and looked up at Susan. &quot;Your father told me.&quot; 

The half-breed succubus blinked hard. &quot;What? Why?&quot; 

Megan smiled softly as she reached up and ran her fingers through 
Susan&#39;s dark green hair. She grabbed a lock of her own hair with her 
free hand and held it close to Susan&#39;s hair for comparison. Susan 
examined both sets of hair and blinked hard as possible explantions 
filled her mind. She looked up and silently stared deep into Megan&#39;s 
red eyes for what seemed an eternity. &quot;You have to be kidding me,&quot; she 
finally said softly. 

&quot;Not in the least,&quot; Megan replied with a warm smile. 

&quot;So do I have any other siblings?&quot; Susan inquired as the realization 
that she had a sister sunk into her brain. 

Megan paused for a moment. &quot;Funny you should mention that....&quot; 

&quot;How many?&quot; Susan said with a heavy sigh. 

&quot;Just one more,&quot; Megan replied with a soft chuckle. &quot;I&#39;m not quite 
sure why Lisa isn&#39;t here yet, but then again she is a bit of a wild 
child.&quot; 

Susan tugged the ribbon of fabric off of her hips and crossed the room 
to sit down on the edge of the bed. &quot;He could have said something,&quot; 
she said quietly to the room as she studied her toenails. Maybe they 
could use a bit of color, she thought. Father, what about your promise 
to Mother? What were you thinking? 

Megan shrugged and sat down next to her half-sister. &quot;Well, I wasn&#39;t 
conceived until about three hundred years after your supposed death, 
so it&#39;s not like he was keeping any secrets.&quot; 

Susan sighed quietly and rubbed her temples. &quot;Where is he right now?&quot; 
She heard silence in response and turned her head to study Megan&#39;s 
face. &quot;He&#39;s dead, isn&#39;t he?&quot; 

&quot;Two hundred years ago,&quot; Megan replied with a soft sigh and a 
reluctant nod. &quot;It&#39;s a very complicated story, but the short version 
is he sacrificed himself so that his wife and child could escape being 
burned at the stake.&quot; 

&quot;So he remarried,&quot; Susan observed with yet another heavy sigh as she 
wondered what happened. She knew she would eventually hear about it, 
but she wasn&#39;t sure if she wanted to know anytime soon. She knew of 
her father&#39;s love of women and near-constant dalliances with them, but 
that was entirely expected of an incubus. She had decided centuries 
ago that it would most likely be the death of him and had planned for 
that eventuality, but had never really fully prepared herself for 
hearing about his eternal lifespan being violently ended. A sudden 
thought blasted into her mind and she cast a sidelong glance at her 
sister. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me that he fell in love with another human....&quot; 

&quot;The pagan leaders didn&#39;t take well to the idea that she willingly 
gave herself over to a demon,&quot; Megan muttered sourly. &quot;The frenzy of 
burnings and executions that followed in the aftermath of that 
incident was called the Salem Witch Hunts.&quot; 

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Susan sighed as she flopped back on the bed, a sudden tide 
of emotions washing over her without warning. Tears formed at the 
corners of her eyes as she felt the strength draining away from her, 
leaving her body feeling cold and unresponsive. She closed her eyes as 
she felt Megan&#39;s light touch on her bare thigh, gently tracing the 
almost invisible network of veins beneath the surface of her skin. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know what to tell you, Susan,&quot; Megan said softly. &quot;I was the 
result of a causal dalliance, so I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to grow 
up with a real loving father. Yes, we kept in touch, but he always 
seemed to either be busy having an affair or talking about you.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Susan said as she blinked her tears away and sat up. 

Megan chuckled very quietly and started running her fingertips under 
the gentle swell of Susan&#39;s bare breast. &quot;I&#39;m told that after you 
vanished, he really changed. He took up smoking nahrlat weed and 
spending most of his time on the Beach,&quot; she said, referring to a 
particular region in the Lake of Fire where amorous succubi were known 
to gather to search for willing partners. &quot;And during the brief 
periods of time when he was in full possession of all of his senses, 
he would tell the others how you were the best thing that had ever 
happened in his life.&quot; 

&quot;I find that a little hard to believe,&quot; Susan said. &quot;We were always on 
good terms, but we weren&#39;t that close.&quot; 

Megan shrugged as she shifted positions to get a closer look at 
Susan&#39;s breasts. &quot;Apparently he didn&#39;t realize what he had until you 
were lost,&quot; she replied as she studied the ultra-soft skin. 

Susan raised a slender eyebrow and took a guess as to what Megan was 
trying to do. &quot;Other side, an inch below the nipple,&quot; she suggested. 

Megan looked at the other breast and saw the tiny star-shaped freckle 
that she was looking for. &quot;Ah, I was wondering where it was. Lisa&#39;s is 
also on her breast, but hers is above the nipple.&quot; 

&quot;Should I ask about yours?&quot; Susan wondered as she thought about the 
odd tendency of birthmarks to appear in the most unusual places. It 
could always be worse, she thought to herself as she briefly thought 
of Lady Mercury&#39;s heart-shaped birthmark and the rather embarassing 
location. 

&quot;Back of the neck,&quot; Megan replied as she straightened up and brushed 
her hair aside to reveal an identical star-shaped freckle on the nape 
of her neck at the hairline. &quot;It took me a month to find it, and 
believe me when I say I was looking everywhere.&quot; 

&quot;I can imagine. Tell me about Lisa,&quot; Susan asked softly. 

Megan chuckled quietly and the tiny wings in her hair fluttered 
briefly. &quot;Eliza,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Lisa was the name chosen by her 
mother.&quot; 

Susan blinked at being told the true-name of another demon, even if it 
belonged to her half-sister. &quot;While we&#39;re briefly on the subject of 
names....&quot; 

&quot;Mordakhen,&quot; the pure succubus said quietly as she leaned forward and 
gave Susan a soft kiss. The sensation sent tingles rippling through 
them both as they briefly shared one of the finer pleasures of being a 
succubus. 

&quot;I trust you&#39;ll forgive me if it takes me awhile to adjust to going 
from being an only child to having two sisters,&quot; Susan murmurred after 
their lips separated. 

Megan chuckled quietly. &quot;You were presumed dead long before I was 
born, so I didn&#39;t have any siblings either until I learned that Father 
had seduced a human and she ended up bearing his child.&quot; 

&quot;Alu demon?&quot; Susan asked, knowing it was the usual result of a 
fruitful union between a human female and an incubus. 

&quot;Actually, she&#39;s half-human like you,&quot; Megan said, then scrambled back 
to avoid a cranial collision as Susan bolted upright in shock. &quot;Don&#39;t 
ask me how that happened, but she&#39;s not an alu demon.&quot; 

Susan rubbed her temples as she tried to think. &quot;It&#39;s my understanding 
that the only reason I wasn&#39;t born an alu was because Mother&#39;s DNA was 
partly protected by the Imperium Silver Crystal&#39;s influence and thus 
couldn&#39;t be dominated.&quot; 

Megan chuckled and ran her fingers through Susan&#39;s dark green hair 
again. &quot;Guess your theory was wrong. My mother&#39;s hair was platinum 
blonde, so you know my hair coloring had to have come from Father.&quot; 

&quot;Amazing,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;My mother also had dark green hair, so I 
had figured it was her influence. What color is Lisa&#39;s hair?&quot; 

&quot;Purple, would you believe?&quot; 

&quot;So much for genetic domination,&quot; Susan said with a faint chuckle. 

Megan sighed and cast an irritated glance over her shoulder. &quot;She 
should have been here by now. I really hope she didn&#39;t let herself get 
side-tracked again. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoy sex just as much as 
the next succubus, but she has me worried.&quot; 

Susan blushed slightly. &quot;It&#39;s probably her human heritage. I was 
rather promiscuous myself when I was in my youth,&quot; she admitted. 

Megan blinked and gave her a curious look. &quot;I was led to believe that 
you were rather conservative about your sexuality.&quot; 

&quot;I am a bit more discriminatory about who I prey upon these days,&quot; 
Susan replied as she rolled over on her side and leaned on her elbow. 
&quot;But between the ages of thirty and two hundred, I had a rather... 
active lifestyle.&quot; 

Megan chuckled and sat back, lightly rubbing the tiny pair of wings on 
her head. &quot;Just how active are we talking here?&quot; 

&quot;A slow week was anything less than ten or twelve times in seven 
days.&quot; 

Her sister blinked hard and straightened up. &quot;Are you serious?&quot; 

Susan shrugged her shoulder causally. &quot;Human blood burns far hotter 
than demonic blood when it&#39;s ignited by desire. So put human desires 
and demonic endurance together....&quot; 

&quot;And you get a really interesting combination,&quot; Megan finished for 
her. 

&quot;Precisely.&quot; 

Megan just shook her head. &quot;And I thought I tended to over-indulge.&quot; 

Susan smiled. &quot;You forget that I&#39;m able to travel back and forth 
through Time. I may have had countless encounters, but they&#39;re spread 
over about two thousand years, give or take a century.&quot; 

The pure-blood succubus opened her mouth to ask a question when a 
burst of light behind her caused her to nearly leap off the bed in 
shock. She quickly turned around and clenched a fist, creating a ball 
of seething red energy around her hand. She aimed her fist at the new 
arrival and waited to see what was going to happen next. 

&quot;Hi, sis! I just... WHOA!&quot; the newcomer babbled excitedly before 
blinking hard at the sight of a ball of lethal energy hovering two 
inches in front of her nose. 

Megan growled quietly. &quot;How many times do I have to tell you not to do 
that so close to a person?&quot; she said as she let the energy dissipate 
into the air around her fist. 

The purple-haired succubus whimpered quietly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry....&quot; she said 
as she fidgeted with the edges of her red leotard. 

Susan raised a slender green eyebrow. &quot;A little edgy, aren&#39;t we?&quot; she 
said to Megan as she carefully looked over the new arrival. &quot;And you 
must be Lisa.&quot; 

Lisa&#39;s face almost exploded into a joyful grin as she lunged forward 
to wrap her arms around her newly-discovered eldest sister. &quot;I am so 
glad to finally meet you!&quot; she gushed as she hugged Susan hard enough 
to make her wince in pain. 

&quot;Lisa!&quot; Megan said sharply. 

Susan chuckled quietly as Lisa abruptly pulled back, allowing air to 
once again enter her lungs. &quot;The exuberance of youth,&quot; she observed as 
she studied Lisa&#39;s somewhat petite figure, noticing that the only hint 
that she wasn&#39;t a full-blooded succubus was the size and coloring of 
her wings. They were half the size of normal succubus wings and were a 
very dark shade of red instead of the usual leathery brown. 

&quot;You&#39;re late,&quot; Megan commented darkly to her younger sister. 

Lisa&#39;s face immdiately puckered into a sad frown. &quot;It&#39;s not my fault,&quot; 
she pleaded, &quot;I was on my way here when I was intercepted by a 
messenger from Lord Hades.&quot; 

The other two succubi immediately sat up and blinked. &quot;What was the 
message?&quot; Susan asked. 

&quot;The messenger said that Lord Hades would be coming here to meet with 
us privately instead of having you summoned to his chambers,&quot; Lisa 
replied. 

Megan immediately scrambled off the bed and started to yank Susan to 
her feet. &quot;If he&#39;s coming here, we have to get you dressed properly,&quot; 
she said as she grabbed the almost-forgotten dark blue ribbon of 
fabric and started to wrap it around Susan&#39;s naked body. &quot;Her boots 
should be in there somewhere,&quot; she said over her shoulder to Lisa. 

Susan sighed quietly and submitted to the whirlwind attention, holding 
still as the ribbon was expertly wrapped around her body in such a way 
as to conceal her groin and criss-cross over her breasts. For added 
measure, a jet- black loin cloth that hung down to her knees was 
looped through a gold chain wrapped around her hips like a belt. 
Knee-high black leather boots were put on as the ribbon was secured in 
a knot behind her neck and the ends allowed to trail freely down her 
back like a second pair of wings. 

&quot;You look good in this,&quot; Megan said admiringly as she debated on 
trying a quick hair adjustment before settling for a quick but gentle 
brushing-out. 

Susan smiled at the compliment. &quot;Someone once said that any succubus 
can look good in anything, everything, and nothing,&quot; she replied. 

Megan chuckled quietly as she worked the brush. &quot;That&#39;s the truth.&quot; 

&quot;You think these earrings would go well?&quot; Lisa inquired as she held up 
a pair of dark sapphires that almost matched the ribbon perfectly. 

&quot;I like these earrings,&quot; Susan protested as she ran her fingertips 
along the dark red double-chevron earrings she usually wore. 

&quot;When did the messenger say Lord Hades was coming?&quot; Megan asked. 

A sudden heavy knock on the chamber door sent a momentary chill 
through everyone. &quot;Nevermind, just get the door,&quot; Megan said hastily 
as she quickly gave Susan&#39;s attire a final once-over before setting 
the hairbrush down and smoothing out her own clothing, the tiny wings 
in her hair fluttering madly. 

The door swung open with a soft creak before Lisa could reach the 
handle and a young woman poked her head in. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not 
interrupting anything,&quot; she said softly with a gentle smile. 

The succubi immediately fell to one knee and bowed their heads before 
the Queen of the Underworld. &quot;Lady Persephone,&quot; Susan said in surprise 
and awe. 

Persephone&#39;s smile grew wider as she stepped into the room, the hem of 
her peach-colored skirt bairly brushing the bare stone floor. &quot;My 
husband sent me a message saying that you had returned, Susan, so of 
course I had to come see for myself.&quot; 

Susan blinked hard, realizing that it was the wrong time of the year 
for the goddess to be living in the Underworld with her husband, 
Hades. According to the legends, the deal was struck between Hades and 
her mother, the goddess Demeter, so that Persephone would spend six 
months of every year with Hades in the Underworld and the other six 
months with Demeter on Mount Olympus. It was also said that when her 
daughter was absent, Demeter would withhold her life-giving warmth 
from nature until Persephone returned unharmed, thus giving rise to 
the turn of the seasons. 

&quot;My lady, I don&#39;t know what to say,&quot; Susan said, still in awe. &quot;Surely 
I am not worth risking your mother&#39;s wrath upon the mortal realm for a 
visit...&quot; 

The goddess laughed softly as she held up her hand. &quot;My mother knows 
how much I adore you like you were my own daughter,&quot; she said kindly. 
&quot;She has given permission for a brief visit without any undue 
effects.&quot; 

Susan bowed her head, moved almost to the point of tears. &quot;My lady...&quot; 
she started to say before her voice failed her. 

Persephone drew Susan to her feet and gestured for the other succubi 
to rise as well. &quot;You have been missed by many in the Underworld,&quot; she 
said quietly. &quot;I have not yet heard all of the details, as my 
husband&#39;s message was brief and my father&#39;s was just as devoid of 
information, but even I felt the Portal&#39;s opening and knew it had to 
herald your return.&quot; 

There was a soft cough from behind Persephone as a dark figure entered 
the room. &quot;Sorry if I only had a brief moment to send only a short 
message, my love,&quot; Lord Hades said with bemusement. &quot;Oh, stop that,&quot; 
he said in mild irritation as the the succubi fell to their knees 
again before him. &quot;There is a time and place for such things, and a 
quiet family gathering isn&#39;t it.&quot; 

&quot;My lord,&quot; Susan replied demurely as they slowly got to their feet 
again. 

&quot;I trust you&#39;ve already met your sisters?&quot; Hades observed as he 
studied the three succubi. He had known Susan since her birth and 
recently gotten to know about Lisa when she became one of Persephone&#39;s 
more favored servants, but knew next to nothing about Megan. 

&quot;I have, my lord, and have to admit being a bit... overwhelmed,&quot; Susan 
replied. 

&quot;Surely that will not preclude you from your duties,&quot; Hades observed. 

&quot;Of course not, my lord,&quot; his avatar replied with a bow of her head. 
&quot;I am always ready to serve you.&quot; 

Hades nodded quietly and turned to his wife. &quot;I know your mother only 
intended for you to see her and not linger, but it is still good to 
see you,&quot; he said softly as he gave her a gentle kiss. 

Persephone smiled warmly at him. &quot;Another few months, my dark knight.&quot; 

Susan and Megan exchanged a momentary look, not surprised in the least 
to see that divinities in love could be every bit as sappy as humans. 
Lisa, for her part, briefly flashed a classic &quot;you have to be kidding 
me&quot; look at her elder sisters. 

&quot;Lisa,&quot; Persephone said quietly, still smiling at her husband and not 
noticing Lisa hastily clearing her face of expression. &quot;I must return 
to Mount Olympus now. I would like you to accompany me to the 
entrance.&quot; 

&quot;As you wish, my lady,&quot; Lisa replied properly with a bow of her head. 

&quot;It is good to see you&#39;ve returned to us, Susan,&quot; the Queen said with 
a smile. &quot;And I look forward to hearing your stories again in a few 
months.&quot; 

&quot;A pleasure as always, my lady,&quot; Susan said with a smile of her own. 

&quot;My lord,&quot; Persephone said to her husband as she took his hand and 
bowed her head slightly. She gave him a final loving smile before she 
released her hold and left the room. Lisa only paused long enough to 
give her master one final bow before hastily following her mistress 
out the door. 

&quot;At least her manners seem sufficient,&quot; Susan observed with a smile as 
the heavy door closed with a gentle creak. 

&quot;Believe me when I say that&#39;s taken some work,&quot; Megan muttered dourly. 

&quot;Perhaps her training could bear some scrutiny if that is the case,&quot; 
Hades said evenly. He watched as Megan blinked involuntarily before 
quickly averting her eyes at the suggestion of his displeasure. &quot;I 
don&#39;t envy you having to suffer the attentions of siblings, having a 
few unpleasant experiences dealing with my own.&quot; 

Susan ventured a smile. &quot;With due respect, my lord, now that I&#39;ve 
gotten a chance to come to terms with the prospect, I rather look 
forward to it.&quot; 

&quot;Your headache,&quot; Hades muttered quietly to himself. He sighed quietly 
and rubbed his hands across his face. &quot;The situation has changed 
drastically with the loss of the Moon Kingdom,&quot; he said evenly. &quot;We no 
longer have a buffer between us and the other worlds, and there have 
been numerous attacks on Earth already.&quot; 

Susan nodded her head. &quot;I have attempted to analyze the situation and 
believe I have a rudimentary understanding of current events.&quot; 

The god raised his eyebrow. &quot;This should be interesting,&quot; he replied. 

Megan cast a sidelong glance at Susan and was grateful that she wasn&#39;t 
involved in things. It wasn&#39;t every day that someone essentially told 
a higher power that they knew as much as he did, and she was curious 
to find out just how far Susan would push things. 

&quot;Queen Beryl is dead, and there are no other known members of their 
royal family,&quot; Susan said as her mind sifted through the conclusions 
she had drawn the day before. &quot;Therefore, while the power of the 
NegaForce can be loaned to other denizens, the full potential remains 
sealed and would not be able to decisively counteract the full power 
of the Imperium Silver Crystal.&quot; 

Hades nodded slowly, quietly impressed by his avatar&#39;s prowess at 
looking at the bigger picture. &quot;However....&quot; he prodded. 

Susan sighed quietly. &quot;However, the Princess and her court were killed 
during the battle and were reincarnated a thousand years later, 
without their memories or full training. Luna and Artemis have done an 
admirable job in teaching them the basics, but they are a far cry from 
being the Celestial Guardians they once were. Worse, Serena has almost 
no clue about how to use the Imperium Silver Crystal except as a means 
of defense. If there were to be a head-on confrontation between her 
and an avatar of the NegaForce tomorrow, I would probably put the odds 
at 5-to-4 in favor of the NegaForce.&quot; 

&quot;Not exactly betting odds,&quot; Megan muttered. 

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Hades sighed. &quot;I&#39;m changing your instructions, Setsuna. You 
will no longer serve the Lunar throne directly, as the Moon Kingdom 
lies in ruins. Your primary duty instead is to ensure the continuity 
of the line of succession to the Imperium Silver Crystal, even if it 
has to jump bloodlines.&quot; 

Susan&#39;s red eyes widened. &quot;My lord?&quot; 

Hades rubbed his face with his hands again. &quot;We are extremely 
vulnerable right now, to a degree not seen since the first days of 
Creation,&quot; he said wearily. &quot;They have attacked the Princess, 
repeatedly, and indeed killed the others once already. She used the 
power of the Imperium Silver Crystal to resurrect them, amazingly 
enough, but none of us believe she knew how she did it, or if she can 
do it again. If they succeed in killing her now, then the power will 
be lost to us forever. We can&#39;t risk that, not now, not with the 
pantheon still weakened. We must make sure that the Crystal will 
always have a dedicated avatar.&quot; 

Susan was at a total loss for words as she struggled to understand the 
exact nature of her new orders. She moved over to her bed and sat down 
on the edge of it, ignoring for the moment her sister and her master 
still standing by the door. 

&quot;I don&#39;t understand,&quot; Megan ventured quietly. 

The Lord of the Underworld shot her a dark look. &quot;You&#39;re not expected 
to be able to understand, as you&#39;re neither an avatar nor one who has 
personal experience dealing with one of the most powerful relics in 
Creation,&quot; he said flatly. &quot;I&#39;m sure Setsuna, however, is able to 
appreciate the magnitude of importance placed on her duties as my 
avatar and can fathom the ramifications of failing to protect the 
Crystal.&quot; 

Susan blinked as the connection finally clicked in her mind. &quot;So faced 
with the option of protecting either the royal bloodline or protecting 
the possible successor....&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;You protect the successor,&quot; Hades said succinctly. 

&quot;Understood, my lord,&quot; his avatar replied as she stood up, looking as 
if she had just eaten a mouthful of very sour grapes. 

Hades sighed quietly again. &quot;Be at ease, my child,&quot; he said softly. &quot;I 
honestly do not expect you will be forced to make such a choice, but 
it must be understood now what you must do should the time come. This 
only changes your highest priority, that&#39;s all. You are still expected 
to do what you can to protect the life of the Moon Princess and the 
other avatars, of course.&quot; 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Susan echoed quietly, still rather unsettled. 

&quot;There is one more change to your instructions,&quot; Hades added. &quot;You 
know that the soul of the Earth prince has been compromised, right?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Susan said as her jaw fell open. 

Hades leaned against the wall and rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;We 
only know that he was infused with a latent power from the other side 
during his kidnapping. We have yet to determine what sort of impact 
this is going to have on matters, but we do believe it will be 
ultimately significant. We must keep him safe until we know more. 
Therefore, in the unlikely event you are faced with the choice of 
protecting either the Princess or the Prince, you are to protect the 
Prince at all costs, save losing the line of succession for the 
Crystal.&quot; 

Susan sat back down on the edge of the bed and buried her face in her 
hands. &quot;Are things really that bad that I must contemplate sacrificing 
the life of the Crown Princess for other goals?&quot; she whispered 
quietly. &quot;Is her death that likely that we must actively plan for 
someone else to take her place?&quot; 

Hades frowned as he pushed himself off of the wall and stood up 
straight. &quot;Consider this, Chancellor,&quot; he said, using her official 
title from the Moon Kingdom. &quot;She was killed once, a thousand years 
ago. Her mother sacrificed her own life so she could be reborn. If she 
can be killed once, she can be killed again, only this time there 
wouldn&#39;t be anyone else capable of using the powers of the Imperium 
Silver Crystal to save this world. Think about it, Setsuna, think very 
long and hard about it.&quot; 

Megan bowed to her master as he turned around and left the room, 
closing the chamber door behind him. Susan said nothing as she stared 
at the stone floor of the keep, her thoughts a chaotic whirl inside 
the intricate depths of her mind. 

&quot;How much of a problem is this going to present?&quot; Megan asked as she 
gave Susan a curious look, trying to fathom what the problem could 
possibly be. 

&quot;Depends on how you look at it,&quot; Susan responded quietly. &quot;I basically 
have to throw away a lifetime of work to the royal family and 
restructure what my priorities are. That won&#39;t be easy or pleasant.&quot; 

&quot;So you guard a prince instead of a princess,&quot; Megan shrugged. &quot;That 
doesn&#39;t sound too difficult. You could probably even make him your sex 
slave, that&#39;d keep him under real tight control,&quot; she added lightly. 

Susan just looked at her younger sister, realizing not for the first 
time that full-blooded demons had different ideas about morals and 
ethics. The concept of emotional bonds such as love was foreign to 
most of them, and it was only due to her human heritage that she 
herself was able to experience such strong feelings for her friends. 

&quot;Lord Hades is right,&quot; she said as she stood up. &quot;You don&#39;t 
understand, but then again, you aren&#39;t expected to. I will perform my 
duties as he has instructed, but it will take some time to adjust. 
Until then, I&#39;ll just have to do the best I can.&quot; 

Megan raised a slender green eyebrow. &quot;This really is going to be a 
bit of a problem for you, isn&#39;t it?&quot; She snorted in contempt when 
Susan nodded her head in response. &quot;Imagine, an avatar with issues 
over whom to protect just because she knows them. I had honestly 
thought you had a stronger spine than this.&quot; 

Susan blinked hard as Megan teleported out of the room in a flash of 
dimensional energy, leaving her alone in the empty keep. &quot;Apparently, 
Lord Hades was right about siblings being a headache,&quot; she said to the 
empty air. &quot;Perhaps this won&#39;t be nearly as interesting as I had 
imagined.&quot; 

She sighed heavily and made a snatching motion in the air, her staff 
materializing out of the temporal flow to smack solidly into her palm. 
Her free hand smoothed out a wrinkle in her attire and made a minor 
adjustment to her loin cloth before she wrapped herself in temporal 
energy and slipped back into the eternal flow of Time.

* 

&quot;You have a visitor this morning,&quot; the wall seemed to say to her as 
she sat down to her morning breakfast. 

Al&#39;vexi raised an eyebrow as she poured herself a glass of juice. 
&quot;Good morning to you too, V&#39;Sari,&quot; the retired general told the pocket 
of shadows in the far corner. &quot;Business or personal?&quot; 

A shadowy figure emerged from the darkness and assumed what appeared 
to be a three-dimensional humanoid form. &quot;He said it was personal,&quot; 
she replied, her voice a soft, sibilant whisper that often reminded 
others of leaves being stirred in a breeze. 

Al&#39;vexi telepathed to her bodyguard as she bit into a slice of toast. 
V&#39;Sari hesitated before replying, which was unusual enough to raise 
the hair on the back of the general&#39;s neck. 

&quot;Call it a woman&#39;s intuition,&quot; V&#39;Sari finally said. 

Al&#39;vexi said nothing as she spread some le&#39;un preserves on another 
slice of toast and took a sip of her juice. She was one of only a 
handful of people in military history to live long enough to retire as 
a flag-rank officer, and at present was the only one still living. The 
threat to her was still quite real, as it was to all senior military 
officials, which was why she still rated a bodyguard in retirement. 

&quot;Security scan?&quot; she said aloud before taking another bite of toast. 

V&#39;Sari consulted the tiny computer pad in her hand. &quot;He&#39;s got a sympia 
spear with him, appears to be a standard Dragoon model. No significant 
psi activity detected, no unusual energy signatures around him.&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi grunted in quiet amusement. She wasn&#39;t worried about the 
weapon in the slightest, as any would-be assassin would first have to 
get past her formidable psionic defenses. She mused that if things got 
unruly, she could always give her opponent a psi-spike with enough 
energy to physically destroy the brain tissue, but that tended to give 
herself a migraine that persisted for days at a time. 

&quot;Show him in,&quot; she said as she reached for the scrambled ertu eggs. 
She made significant progress in devouring most of them before a young 
man in a dark cloak entered the room and stood next to the chair on 
the opposite side of the table. 

&quot;Nice to know you still prefer the simple breakfast,&quot; he said lightly 
as he examined the selection of v&#39;etu toast, talan juice, scrambled 
ertu eggs, and slices of assorted fruits. &quot;Mind if I sit?&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi looked up in surprise, and it was only due to many centuries 
of rigid mental discipline that kept her from spitting out a mouthful 
of egg and gasping for air. As it was, it took her several seconds 
before she could pull her mind together to form coherent thought. &quot;I 
thought you were dead,&quot; she said after swallowing hard and taking a 
deep breath. 

Jedyt smiled coldly as he moved the chair back and sat down. &quot;Beryl is 
dead,&quot; he corrected her. &quot;I was merely hidden in the rafters.&quot; 

&quot;Well, now, this is a surprise,&quot; Al&#39;vexi said as she spooned some more 
scrambled ertu eggs onto her plate and fought very hard to retain her 
casual outside composure. &quot;So what brings you here?&quot; 

&quot;You tell me,&quot; he replied as he grabbed a slice of s&#39;car from the pile 
of fruit and started munching on it. 

she telepathed at him as she resumed her attack on the eggs. 

Jedyt chuckled. &quot;Good guess, but you&#39;re wrong. Rune released me from 
my crystal for just that purpose, but to be honest I don&#39;t give a wet 
rakketh corpse about who&#39;s running things.&quot; 

The retired general glanced up at him in irritation as she refilled 
her glass of juice. 

&quot;Revenge,&quot; he said simply. 

&quot;On whom?&quot; Al&#39;vexi prompted after draining half the glass. 

&quot;Sailor Moon,&quot; the blond general replied as he picked up a wedge of 
the bittersweet d&#39;ael melon. 

Al&#39;vexi smiled darkly at her unexpected guest. &quot;You don&#39;t ask for 
much, do you?&quot; 

&quot;I know who she is on Earth,&quot; he replied around a mouthful of melon. 
&quot;I watched her, Sailor Mercury, and Sailor Mars transform, and know 
their true identities.&quot; 

That gave the telepath a momentary chill. &quot;Really,&quot; she said slowly in 
mild disbelief. 

&quot;Really,&quot; Jedyt confirmed. &quot;Serena, Ami, and Rei. And I know exactly 
where Rei&#39;s temple is, too,&quot; he added with a malicious grin. &quot;I spent 
some time there once, working as a temporary aide as part of a 
disguise. She&#39;s a feisty one....&quot; he mused. 

&quot;And the others?&quot; Al&#39;vexi said, curious now. She knew from the reports 
she had seen that they had figured out that Sailor Mercury&#39;s real name 
was Ami and that she had become a vampire, but virtually everything 
else they knew about her was very sketchy conjecture. Except, of 
course, for what they knew about Prince Darian, but that was a 
different matter entirely.... 

&quot;What others?&quot; Jedyt said flatly as he gave her a slightly wary look. 

Al&#39;vexi smirked as she took a sip of juice. &quot;Not nearly as informed as 
you thought you were, Jedyt? There are two other Sailor Scouts to deal 
with as well, Sailor Jupiter and Sailor Venus. Plus, I&#39;d imagine, we 
still have the odd problem with that Sailor V girl.&quot; 

&quot;That bitch,&quot; Jedyt spat. &quot;We haven&#39;t found her yet?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s apparently harder to find than Sailor Moon,&quot; Al&#39;vexi observed 
with a casual shrug. &quot;She wiped out most of our long-term agents, but 
we still have Agent M in place and sending back regular reports. 
Including sightings of our beloved Sailor V, alive and well.&quot; 

Jedyt grunted quietly to himself. He realized that his knowledge of 
the long-term operations on Earth was obviously outdated by now, but 
he still remembered the plans drawn up about Agent M. Jedyt thought it 
was a he, but didn&#39;t have much information about him, save that he was 
one of the most highly skilled surveillance agents ever trained by the 
military. His mission on Earth was to blend in as a native and report 
back on what he learned and observed about humans that could be of use 
to the Negaverse. 

&quot;So two more Sailor Scouts to deal with?&quot; he said warily after a long 
pause to consider developments. 

&quot;Seems that way,&quot; Al&#39;vexi replied as she picked up the last piece of 
toast and spread more le&#39;un preserves on it. &quot;And they&#39;re just as 
lethal as the other three. Anyone ever tell you about the Psi-Corp 
Complex?&quot; 

Jedyt shrugged. &quot;I heard the reactor got blown out, that was it. I 
take it they managed to crater it?&quot; 

She scowled at his casual attitude about the total destruction of the 
Psi-Corp Headquarters Complex and the loss of almost a full ninety 
percent of the ranks of the Psi-Corp. She herself had been the Captain 
of the Psi-Corp at one point before her promotion to Brigadier started 
her along the very treacherous path to full General. 

&quot;We&#39;re still not entirely sure what happened,&quot; she said in an edged 
tone. &quot;I understand that some of the debris in the crater still glows 
at night, so we can&#39;t get close enough to try and find out.&quot; 

Jedyt made a noise in his throat. &quot;Radiation is a bitch, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi sighed as her patience started to fray at the edges. &quot;Why are 
you here, Jedyt?&quot; 

The young general smirked and leaned back in his chair. &quot;I understand 
that we managed to capture that annoying Tuxedo Mask for awhile, and 
that you got to spend some time with his mind under your telepathic 
microscope.&quot; 

&quot;That much is true,&quot; Al&#39;vexi admitted neutrally. 

&quot;I would be most interested in reading your personal notes about that 
experience,&quot; he said. &quot;Not just the official reports, but your 
psychological analysis as well. The stuff that you left out before 
filing the reports.&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi took a large bite out of the toast. 

Jedyt reached into his cloak and pulled out a small folder. Even from 
across the table, Al&#39;vexi could make out four different types of 
high-level classification sigils stamped on it, including the 
&quot;Seven-Aerce&quot; designation from the Dragoon Legion, usually reserved 
only for the Queen herself. 

&quot;A little biographical sketch about Sailor Moon,&quot; Jedyt said in 
response to Al&#39;vexi&#39;s eyebrows hitting the proverbial roof. &quot;Something 
General Rune was able to observe for herself that hasn&#39;t become public 
knowledge yet. This secret report in exchange for your secret report.&quot; 

The retired general thought very carefully for a moment. &quot;How do I 
know that is genuine information?&quot; she said, trying to stall for time 
to think. 

Jedyt opened the report and flipped to the very last page. &quot;Here, you 
can use your famous object-sense skill on the signature,&quot; he offered 
as he laid the report in front of her. 

Al&#39;vexi leaned forward to examine the page, noticing immediately that 
the signature was real ink instead of a carbon-copy reproduction. 
&quot;This is the original?&quot; she said in surprise. She glanced up in time 
to catch Jedyt rolling his eyes at the ceiling. &quot;Nevermind,&quot; she 
muttered as she wiped her hand on a napkin and lightly pressed her 
fingertip against the signature. 

Every object and creature has a unique psionic aura around it, some 
with stronger or more noticable auras than others. One of Al&#39;vexi&#39;s 
better mental skills was the ability to sense the imprints of psionic 
auras left on objects by contact with other unique auras. It was 
rather difficult to read some types of objects, as imprints tend to 
fade with time or become obscured by multiple imprints, but the auras 
in the ink were relatively easy to read. 

This is a medium grade of soyo ink, not very common, used primarly in 
the North Polar Region, she thought to herself as her psionic powers 
analyzed every aspect of the ink. However, it is also exported to the 
other regions for use in fancy pens. The ink in this signature was 
housed in an aluminum-tungsten cylinder inlaid with several small 
carbon gemstones, most likely high-grade cubic zirconium. There 
appears to be several other contaminants around the housing, at least 
half a dozen unique crystal structures with stunted growth. Very tiny, 
probably not visible to the naked eye. And both the housing and the 
crystal seeds have been recently in contact with a single denizen. 
Female, strong grip, I&#39;d say middle-aged, with dark purple hair and a 
penchant for manipulating the molecular structure of crystals and 
minerals.... 

&quot;It&#39;s Rune, alright,&quot; Al&#39;vexi admitted as she mentally cleared her 
mind of the sudden clutter of information. 

&quot;And you know that if Rune puts her signature on paper....&quot; Jedyt 
offered. 

&quot;...That she regards it as being official truth,&quot; she finished. 
&quot;Which, if you stop and think, really doesn&#39;t say a lot.&quot; 

Jedyt leaned back in the chair and smirked. &quot;Yes, but this is about a 
report she didn&#39;t release, so why would she bother to make it up?&quot; 

&quot;Disinformation?&quot; the telepath suggested. 

Jedyt snorted in distain and took the report back. &quot;Just tell me 
you&#39;re not interested so we can move on with other things,&quot; he said 
darkly. 

&quot;Why do you want my report on Prince Darian?&quot; Al&#39;vexi inquired as she 
sat back to contemplate matters. She had no doubt that Rune wrote the 
report, but was still trying to determine just how curious she really 
was about what it contained. 

&quot;There is a saying on Earth.... know thine enemy,&quot; Jedyt replied. 
&quot;That, and I want to see if anyone knows why the NegaForce has such a 
keen interest in him.&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi said nothing as she sipped at her nearly-empty cup of juice. 
she telepathed. 

&quot;How long have we known one another?&quot; Jedyt said quietly. 

she thought honestly. 

&quot;I&#39;m touched,&quot; he responsed dryly. 



He tapped the report. &quot;If this report is true, then we are 
probably.... no, if this becomes public knowledge, then we WILL have a 
civil war. I may be many things, Al&#39;vexi, most of them repulsive to 
you, but I am not one prone to doomsday predictions. This report has 
me worried, deeply worred. I have every reason to believe this report 
is accurate, and the reason I came to you is that I want another 
experienced opinion for comparison.&quot; 

The telepath sighed as she sat back in her chair. &quot;Spare me the 
drama.&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Moon is only half-human.&quot; 

It took several seconds for the icy shiver to quit running up and down 
her spine. &quot;You&#39;re serious,&quot; she said very slowly. 

He nodded and held up the report, the highest levels of classification 
markings clearly stamped on the front cover. &quot;This report for your 
report, and believe me when I say I think you&#39;re getting the better 
end of the deal. I just want to know as much about Darian as 
possible.&quot; 

Al&#39;vexi eyeballed the report long and hard before she sighed heavily 
and stood up from the table. &quot;Wait here,&quot; she said simply and left, 
leaving a relieved Jedyt sitting alone at the table. He examined the 
contents of the fruit bowl for a few seconds before he picked out 
another slice of s&#39;car and idly nibbled on it. 

She returned a minute later holding a well-used data tablet and a 
small memory crystal. &quot;I never bothered to print it out,&quot; she 
commented as she sat down at the table and held the items out to 
Jedyt. &quot;Some things are just too dangerous to leave lying around.&quot; 

He nodded in complete understanding as he passed his report over to 
her and picked up the data tablet. &quot;No offense, Al&#39;vexi, but this has 
seen better days,&quot; he observed as he studied it. &quot;They quit making 
this model how many centuries ago?&quot; 

&quot;It was a gift from a friend when I was accepted into the academy,&quot; 
the telepath replied absently as she opened the cover and started 
reading the long list of security citations and warnings. &quot;Unlike most 
other things, it has served me quite well over the years. If you ever 
live long enough to reach my age, perhaps you&#39;ll be able to appreciate 
such seemingly trivial things,&quot; she said as she glanced up at him. 

Jedyt grunted quietly to himself as he mentally calculated the 
probable age difference between them. He had participated in the 
attack on the Moon Kingdom, but had only been a very young Field 
Captain at the time. Al&#39;vexi, on the other hand, had already been 
promoted to Brigadier before the attack took place and was well on her 
way to making Lieutenant General. She had asked to remain behind in 
the Negaverse to oversee the reserve forces rather than lead a 
division of her own during the invasion, a move that had caused many 
of her peers to question her ability to lead. Ultimately, however, it 
proved to have been a wise course of action as the few senior officers 
to return alive from the invasion ended up spending anywhere between a 
month and a decade in suspended animation while their bodies were 
slowly regenerated. 

He sighed quietly to himself as he carefully plugged in the memory 
crystal and instructed the tablet to retrieve the data. No sense in 
upsetting her over some foolish sentimental issue, he thought as he 
began to read. 

Al&#39;vexi also read in silence, trying to absorb the contents of the 
report without jumping to any conclusions. It was a detailed contact 
report about the events that transpired in the depths of the Dragoon 
Legion Headquarters Complex when the Sailor Scouts, aided by the 
denizens now in exile on Earth, broke into one of the lower level 
storage facilities. Rune had laid a trap for them, of course, which 
ultimately had failed. That in itself was of no surprise to her, as 
they had yet to be successfully caught in any sort of trap laid by the 
military. 

What she found the most shocking, however, was the information that 
was revealed about Sailor Moon during that incident. She read and 
re-read the paragraph several times to make absolutely sure there was 
no misunderstanding of the situation. &quot;Jedyt...&quot; she said slowly. 

&quot;That&#39;s something worth losing sleep over, don&#39;t you agree?&quot; he 
replied absently, still rapidly reading the psychological report and 
trying to absorb as much information as possible. 

&quot;If she is half-denizen, that changes the equation to a degree you 
would simply not believe,&quot; she sighed as she leaned back and rubbed 
her eyes. 

Jedyt paused and glanced up. &quot;Try me,&quot; he suggested. 

&quot;Sailor Moon could become the Queen Regent,&quot; Al&#39;vexi replied. 

It took a minute for his blood to thaw out after a momentary chill. 
&quot;You want to run that one past me again?&quot; 

She gestured to her report on the data tablet. &quot;Keep reading and let 
me know when you get to the part about when Darian was quietly named 
Crown Prince by both Beryl and the NegaForce.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; Jedyt exclaimed and started to speed-read as fast as he 
could. 

the retired general telepathed to her bodyguard. 

&quot;Unbelievable,&quot; Jedyt spat as he read the paragraph. &quot;What was Beryl 
thinking?&quot; 

&quot;She was apparently thinking that she had found her lifemate,&quot; Al&#39;vexi 
replied dryly as she closed her mind and focused on a small box buried 
in the back of a drawer in her dresser. Her limited telekinetic powers 
were just strong enough to reach out, grab hold of the box, and start 
to twist four- dimensional space around it. 

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; he asked as he saw the look of intense 
concentration on her heavily lined and well-aged face. He blinked hard 
as a very fuzzy geometric configuration started to appear on the 
table, a shimmering tangle of lines of power. The fuzzy shape 
persisted for a few seconds before unraveling at the seams and 
disappearing, leaving a small wooden box behind. 

&quot;That was an effort,&quot; Al&#39;vexi grunted as she reached out and opened 
the box. &quot;Teleportation is not my thing. Want one?&quot; 

Jedyt peered into the box and blinked. &quot;Citran?&quot; he ventured. 

&quot;Citran laced with mee&#39;pa and vel&#39;sik,&quot; Al&#39;vexi corrected as she 
picked up one of the herbal cigarettes. 

&quot;Al&#39;vexi, you surprise me,&quot; he said as he leaned back to observe her 
carefully. &quot;You had always seemed so straight-laced to me. I&#39;m sure I 
don&#39;t have to remind a trained telepath about the dangers of 
mind-altering drugs.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, stuff it,&quot; she grumped. &quot;Yes, if you smoked each component alone 
it will have you on on your ptanka in various ways. Blend them 
together in the right proportions, however, and the psychotic effects 
are nullified. The only effect it has then is to dampen higher thought 
and psionic activity.&quot; 

&quot;So you can get stoned without worrying about having the wrong 
thoughts triggering random psionic powers,&quot; Jedyt summarized dryly. 

&quot;I&#39;m immune to most analgesics,&quot; she sighed. &quot;So when I get a migraine 
headache like I just got three minutes ago, my only options are suffer 
for hours or take something that blots out most of my brain&#39;s sensory 
functions,&quot; she explained as she held out the end of the cigarette to 
him. 

Jedyt gave her a reproving look before he reached out and touched his 
fingertip to the end of the cigarette, sending a surge of raw energy 
through it. The end started to smoulder briefly before igniting in a 
soft whoosh of air and heat. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; the retired telepath said as she blew out the small flame 
and took a slow puff from the herbal blend. &quot;We have a lot to think 
about,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;We have two pieces of a deeply disturbing 
picture on our hands right now. My piece comes from my probing of 
Prince Darian&#39;s mind, but when we add your piece about Princess 
Serena... this might take quite some time for us to hash out. Oh, 
thank you, V&#39;Sari,&quot; she added as her bodyguard silently appeared at 
her elbow and set the bottle and glasses on the table. 

Jedyt grunted quietly and glanced back down at the data tablet. &quot;You 
seem to have a head-start on this already,&quot; he replied. &quot;I still don&#39;t 
see where you get Sailor Moon becoming the Queen Regent.&quot; 

&quot;Classified discussion, V&#39;Sari,&quot; Al&#39;vexi said mildly as she stripped 
the gold foil off of the top of the wine bottle. &quot;Truth be told, I&#39;m 
probably not cleared for it, so please don&#39;t mention this to anyone.&quot; 

&quot;Of course not,&quot; V&#39;Sari replied quietly and silently withdrew. 

&quot;You trust her?&quot; Jedyt asked softly. 

&quot;If you can&#39;t trust your bodyguard, who can you trust?&quot; Al&#39;vexi said 
with a shrug. &quot;My logic for the Regent is very simple. Darian is the 
Crown Prince, his daughter will be the next Crown Princess, and the 
child&#39;s mother will be the Queen Regent until the Princess is old 
enough to assume the throne,&quot; she said evenly as she puffed quietly on 
her cigarette while trying to work the cork free of the bottle. &quot;And 
the way things look, his most likely choice for a lifemate will be 
Sailor Moon.&quot; 

Jedyt grunted quietly as he continued to read the report. &quot;Even if 
that was a given, we&#39;re still missing several things. Tell me again 
how he ended up as the Crown Prince?&quot; 

The telepath closed her eyes for a moment to think. &quot;When we kidnapped 
him and brought him to Beryl, she had a team of telepaths suppress his 
memories of Earth and the Sailor Scouts. She then took him to see the 
NegaForce. I&#39;m not entirely sure what happened then, but when they 
emerged he was very much under her spell. So much so, in fact, that 
Beryl took him as her lover and proclaimed him her Prince.&quot; 

Jedyt found himself suppressing a shudder of revulsion. &quot;That&#39;s not 
the most pleasant of mental images,&quot; he said sourly. 

There was a soft pop as the cork finally came free. &quot;Beryl wasn&#39;t what 
most would call fashion model material, but even you have to admit she 
had a certain appeal to her that most men would find intriguing to 
some degree,&quot; she said as she poured the wine into a glass and held it 
out to her guest. 

&quot;Granted, but not enough to sleep with. What&#39;s this?&quot; he inquired as 
he accepted the glass and sniffed it carefully. 

&quot;Asleen Purple Twenty-Three,&quot; Al&#39;vexi replied as she poured a glass 
for herself. &quot;I know it&#39;s not made anymore, and you usually save rare 
wines like this for special occasions, but I thought it a good idea to 
have some now. You can think of it as celebrating what will 
undoubtedly be a very major turning point in the history of the 
Negaverse.&quot; 

He smirked. &quot;Yes, nothing like the prospect of a global upheaval to 
make one want to celebrate. Here&#39;s to the grand and glorious 
revolution,&quot; he said and clinked his glass against hers. 

&quot;Be very careful what you wish for,&quot; she said after sipping her wine.

The central axis of the Dragoon Headquarters Complex was not perfectly 
parallel to the equator, being instead tilted at a six-degree angle 
towards the north. The logic for this was to take advantage of a 
natural depression on the western horizon where two ridges had formed 
countless eons ago. 

A tiny point of light hovered on the horizon between the peaks of the 
ridges, just high enough in the sky to be visible above any lingering 
morning fog. Soaring high above the planet in a perfect geosynchronous 
position, the orbital mirror known as Essence kept a constant 
electronic eye on the western face of the Complex and waited for 
further instructions. 

The ground beneath the Complex began to rumble as massive motors 
started up, pushing a pair of giant steel platforms up from the ground 
and away from the space between the western and central spines of the 
building. The topsoil normally covering the plates had been kept very 
shallow for just this reason, spilling away with ease as the plates 
angled up like the ends of a drawbridge. The result was an almost 
cavern-like void between the spines, free from dirt or any other 
obstacles that might get in the way. 

The entire west wing of the Complex began to split in two, the 
normally perpendicular north and south spines slowly folding inward to 
run parallel to the main axis and exposing a massive exhaust port that 
was easily twenty feet in diameter. Special reflective plates extended 
out from inside the port, forming a guide path for what was clearly 
becoming the business end of a very powerful weapon. 

A small laser array on the roof of the Complex oriented on the orbital 
mirror and started firing pulses of light at it, checking the 
alignment of the barrel and instructing the firing computer to elevate 
the barrel by another full degree. A misty cloud formed at the end as 
the barrel was purged with inert xenon gas and the magnetic coils 
started to power up, giving the highly reflective metal a faint glow 
of energy. 

&quot;Phase Two transformation completed,&quot; the computer reported. 

&quot;Engineering to Commander K&#39;tal,&quot; the speaker crackled. &quot;The firing 
housing is now available, estimate we will have a full charge in five 
minutes.&quot; 

K&#39;tal thumbed the microphone switch. &quot;Lock and load the shell, Chief, 
but keep full safeties on it until I say otherwise.&quot; 

&quot;Safe loading, aye sir. Engineering out.&quot; 

D&#39;Nina gave him a curious glance. &quot;Hedging our bets, Commander?&quot; 

K&#39;tal grunted quietly. &quot;Call it a hunch, Chief.&quot; 

D&#39;Nina studied him for a moment before turning her attention to the 
young lieutenant at Communications. &quot;Lieutenant T&#39;Pri, are we still 
operating under the VBF system?&quot; she asked. 

The lieutenant blinked hard. &quot;VBF? Actually, that system is not in use 
unless it&#39;s specifically called for,&quot; she replied with a small frown. 

Captain Ael&#39;ien leaned over to K&#39;tal. &quot;What&#39;s the VBF system?&quot; she 
asked in a low tone. 

&quot;It&#39;s nothing sanctioned by current regulations,&quot; he replied as he 
watched his console. &quot;Basically, it means that if anyone in the 
building gets any sort of premonition about our current situation, 
they have permission to call it in to Operations. True precognition is 
rare, as you no doubt know, but the theory behind the VBF system is 
that psionically active denizens may be able to get a bit of a &#39;gut 
feeling&#39; about the immediate future.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien blinked and thought about the concept for a moment. &quot;If you 
stop and think about it, it sounds like a plausible theory. Should I 
ask why the Psi-Corp hasn&#39;t been consulted about it?&quot; 

K&#39;tal snorted quietly. &quot;It has, Captain. Problem is, everyone who was 
directly involved in the group discussion is either dead or in exile,&quot; 
he said with a sour look. &quot;The VBF system is a low-priority 
experiment, so it doesn&#39;t surprise me in the least that you haven&#39;t 
heard about it yet.&quot; 

&quot;Very well, Lieutenant,&quot; D&#39;Nina said to Communications, &quot;I am 
officially requesting that the VBF system be activated immediately.&quot; 

The lieutenant cleared her throat. &quot;Actually, Chief, that 
requires....&quot; she started to say, then trailed off as she noticed 
K&#39;tal giving her a dark look. She blinked hard, swallowed, and reached 
for her headset. 

Everyone looked up at the nearest speaker as the three-note electronic 
whistle echoed throughout the Complex. &quot;Attention all hands, the VBF 
system is now in effect. I repeat, the VBF system is now in effect. 
All notices are to be sent to Operations using prefix seven-two and a 
level-two priority. Operations out.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Lieutenant,&quot; D&#39;Nina said with a slight nod of her head. 

&quot;Got a premonition of your own, Chief?&quot; K&#39;tal asked quietly. 

She shrugged. &quot;Call it a hunch, Commander.&quot; 

&quot;One last question,&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked. &quot;What exactly does VBF stand for?&quot; 

&quot;Very Bad Feeling,&quot; K&#39;tal replied with a straight face. 

The telepath blinked hard. &quot;Seriously?&quot; 

&quot;Seriously.&quot; 

Psi-Corp Captain Ael&#39;ien promptly made a mental note to make a 
discreet inquiry about the possibility of reading K&#39;tal&#39;s 
psychological profile. 

&quot;I&#39;ve got a bad feeling about this,&quot; Asrial growled flatly. 

K&#39;tal gave her a reproving look. &quot;You&#39;re not psionic, Lieutenant, but 
I will take your recommendation into consideration.&quot; 

&quot;Commander?&quot; the communications lieutenant said as she frowned at her 
console. &quot;I have a level 3 VBF report from a field sergeant in 
Security.&quot; 

&quot;Noted,&quot; K&#39;tal replied. The VBF system was rated from one to three, 
with a three being a low-confidence feeling, a two being of 
medium-confidence, and a one being a premonition that the psionicist 
believed had a high degree of confidence. He had decided long ago that 
he wouldn&#39;t let himself become very concerned about the VBF results 
until he either got a VBF-1 report or if he started getting several 
reports at once. 

&quot;Engineering to Commander K&#39;tal.&quot; 

&quot;K&#39;tal here.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, the shell is ready,&quot; the Chief Engineer reported. &quot;I&#39;m 
requesting permission to seal the housing and arm the primary.&quot; 

K&#39;tal crossed his arms and briefly closed his eyes. &quot;Why do I have 
this sinking feeling, D&#39;Nina?&quot; he murmured quietly. 

The master chief gave him a concerned look. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you&#39;re 
having premonitions of your own,&quot; she grumbled. &quot;I thought all the psi 
tests were normal for you.&quot; 

&quot;I thought so too, but who knows. K&#39;tal to Engineering.&quot; 

&quot;Venta.&quot; 

&quot;Seal the housing and arm the primary. Estimated time until the 
primary is fully charged and ready to fire?&quot; 

&quot;Two minutes, sir,&quot; the speaker responded as a low rumbling frequency 
started up in the background. Deep inside the Complex, the cannon&#39;s 
housing sealed itself off from the atmosphere around it and started to 
purge itself with xenon gas. Directly behind the cannon&#39;s breech, the 
primary firing chamber was rolled forward on tracks and connected to 
the base of the cannon. Once fully charged, it would be rammed into 
the bore of the cannon to create a super-dense plasma spark that would 
immolate the shell and trigger a powerful ionized shock front. The 
front would sweep through the length of the barrel and become 
hyper-accelerated by successive layers of magetic fields, emerging 
from the end of the barrel as a focused beam composed of waves of 
super-charged particles with enough kinetic energy to crater a 
mountain. 

The primary interlock was released as the chamber was fully connected 
to the bore and the magnetic coils began to energize. The mouth of the 
barrel began to softly glow blue as small particles of air became 
ionized and were drawn inward towards the coils, looking like a small 
gathering of fireflies converging down a large tunnel. 

&quot;Let&#39;s not screw the pooch on this one, Chief,&quot; K&#39;tal admonished as he 
watched the status screen changing on his display. 

There was a lengthy silence on the other end. &quot;We&#39;ll try not to, sir,&quot; 
the engineer replied cautiously before closing the circuit. 

&quot;Screw the pooch?&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked with a puzzled look on her face. 

K&#39;tal shrugged. &quot;Earth expression. The translation would be close to 
making a k&#39;vesi mess of things and ending up taking it in the ptanka.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you for sharing that with us, Commander,&quot; D&#39;Nina replied dryly 
with a faint blush on her elderly features. 

&quot;My pleasure, Chief,&quot; K&#39;tal responded with a grin. &quot;Remind me to 
invite you to my office for lunch one day and we can go over some of 
the other, more colorful expressions the humans have come up with.&quot; 

&quot;Commander....&quot; his Communications officer said in a warning tone. 
&quot;I&#39;ve just gotten a level 3 VBF report from a junior lieutenant in 
Supply and a level 2 report from a cadet in Engineering.&quot; 

K&#39;tal felt a slight chill start to creep into his veins. &quot;Noted,&quot; he 
said in response and re-examined his console display. &quot;Asrial, what&#39;s 
the situation with the crypto-linker?&quot; 

The Felinoid growled flatly and held up the still-disconnected circuit 
board. &quot;Offline,&quot; she spat. She then stuck her head inside the 
dismembered console and growled a question at the forest-green tail 
that was the only part of Ji&#39;an anyone could see. There was a muted 
response from within and she rolled her eyes at the ceiling. 

K&#39;tal turned around and stared at the console&#39;s access panel that had 
been almost literally ripped off the housing and tossed aside. The 
silence seemed to stretch on for an eternity as his eyes went slightly 
vacant, a sign to those who knew him that he was doing some very 
serious thinking. 

&quot;Engineering to Commander K&#39;tal,&quot; the speaker crackled, &quot;The 
particle-wave cannon is now fully armed and ready to fire. Firing 
control is now available on your master console.&quot; 

K&#39;tal looked up at his console as a yellow light began blinking. 
&quot;K&#39;tal here,&quot; he said into the microphone as he stared at the flashing 
light. &quot;I now have the firing control system. Chief....&quot; he said 
slowly. &quot;Find that cadet who filed the VBF report and put him on the 
circuit.&quot; 

He could practically hear half of Operations blinking in surprise 
behind his back. &quot;One moment, sir,&quot; the engineer said. 

&quot;Commander, what are you doing?&quot; Ael&#39;ien inquired softly. 

K&#39;tal didn&#39;t bother looking over his shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m running my 
division as I see fit,&quot; he replied evenly. &quot;This may be an exercise, 
but we will fire when and only when I am satisfied everything is as it 
should be.&quot; 

Ael&#39;ien blinked hard and looked over at D&#39;Nina. She noticed that the 
master chief seemed surprised as well but didn&#39;t appear upset in the 
least. 

&quot;Engineering, Cadet Sash,&quot; a nervous voice said from the speaker. 

&quot;This is Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal,&quot; the Dragoon said as he leaned 
closer to the microphone. &quot;Listen very carefully, Cadet. You obviously 
had a reason for filing that Level 2 VBF report, so I want to hear it. 
Tell me precisely what went through your mind, no matter how silly or 
asinine it might sound. If you have a thought, I want to hear it. 
That&#39;s a direct order.&quot; 

The sound of the cadet swallowing hard was heard quite clearly. &quot;Sir, 
I just felt that something was very.... out of place. Like something 
was.... well, not missing, but just not where it should be.&quot; 

K&#39;tal grunted quietly. &quot;Anything specific?&quot; 

&quot;No, sir,&quot; the speaker quivered. &quot;It was just a horrific feeling that 
something wasn&#39;t quite right. Didn&#39;t last very long, sir, just long 
enough to get spooked and send that report.&quot; 

The Dragoon commander closed his eyes for a moment. &quot;You said your 
name is Sash?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 

&quot;So what do you recommend?&quot; K&#39;tal asked the cadet. 

&quot;Sir??&quot; the cadet replied, his state of near-panic evident in his 
voice. Around him, both Ael&#39;ien and D&#39;Nina blinked hard at the idea of 
the commanding officer asking for input from a mere cadet. 

&quot;I said I wanted to hear what you think, Cadet,&quot; K&#39;tal said gently. 
&quot;Let me worry about what to make of your suggestion, but I still want 
to hear it.&quot; 

There was a very faint sound of someone in the background that sounded 
to K&#39;tal like someone offering words of advice to the cadet. &quot;Sir,&quot; he 
finally said in a somewhat shaky tone, &quot;It is my recommendation that 
we do not fire the particle-wave cannon until we have everything 
double- and triple-checked.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Cadet Sash, sounds like a good idea to me,&quot; K&#39;tal 
responded. &quot;Engineering, you heard him. I want every reading checked 
again, including the targeting and mirror alignment data.&quot; 

&quot;Engineering copies,&quot; the voice of the chief engineer said on the 
circuit. &quot;We&#39;re double-checking everything now.&quot; 

&quot;Well done, Cadet, you may return to your post,&quot; K&#39;tal said. 

&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; the speaker said in an obviously relieved tone 
before it clicked off. 

&quot;You planned on having everything checked anyway, right?&quot; D&#39;Nina 
ventured. 

K&#39;tal nodded. &quot;Of course, but it never hurts to occasionally give a 
cadet the impression that he&#39;s making a serious contribution. 
Tactical, can you tell me precisely where those target coordinates are 
aimed at?&quot; 

The tactical officer consulted his display. &quot;Target coordinates are 
for the Number 2 Orbital Bombardment Range in the Northern Mountains.&quot; 

&quot;Makes sense,&quot; K&#39;tal mused. &quot;Just how far away is the range from the 
repair facility in Sector Seven? In general terms,&quot; he added. 

&quot;Close enough to see the light show, far enough away not to have to 
worry about blast effects or a drifting shot,&quot; the officer replied 
after punching the data request into his terminal. 

&quot;Fair enough. T&#39;Pri, would you be so kind as to send a brief message 
to Sector Seven, my respects to Master Chief Octane and her team, and 
advise her of an incoming round? Just to be polite.&quot; 

D&#39;Nina chuckled. &quot;I remember Chief Octane,&quot; she said with a smile and 
a shake of her head. &quot;Fortunate that our scout cruiser landed so close 
to her facility and that she had a spare gravity shield available.&quot; 

K&#39;tal grunted in amusement. &quot;Fortunate that she didn&#39;t charge us an 
arm and a leg for the repairs,&quot; he replied. 

&quot;Engineering to Commander K&#39;tal.&quot; 

K&#39;tal sighed quietly and opened the circuit. &quot;K&#39;tal here.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, all systems have been triple-checked and are operating normally. 
All computer systems are responding without error, the targeting data 
checks out, and the mirror array is responding within tolerances,&quot; the 
speaker said. 

The Dragoon commander paused for a moment. &quot;Run that one past me 
again, Chief,&quot; he said slowly. &quot;What exactly do you mean within 
tolerances?&quot; 

&quot;The targeting laser is having to adjust the angle by a millimeter 
every thirty seconds,&quot; the engineering chief reported. &quot;That is still 
well within the margins for using an orbital reflection weapon, taking 
into account the rotational motion of the planet, the satellite, and 
the gravity wells of our three moons.&quot; 

K&#39;tal sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose, knowing he wasn&#39;t the 
first denizen who dearly wished the Negaverse&#39;s three moons would 
settle down into stable, predictable orbits instead of behaving like 
three massive insects buzzing around a pile of vep&#39;tera turds. 
Theories for their erratic movements numbered in the hundreds, but to 
date not a single one had been proven to the point of allowing a 
plotted orbit that lasted longer than a week. 

There was a sharp grunt from within the depths of the disassembled 
console and Ji&#39;an scrambled out from inside. &quot;Excuse me, Commander,&quot; 
he said in a tone that was surprisingly gentle in constrast to 
Asrial&#39;s usually edged tone. He leaned over to the microphone and 
spoke into it. &quot;Chief, this is Ji&#39;an.&quot; 

&quot;Go ahead,&quot; Engineering replied. 

&quot;Essence is in a perfect geosynchronous orbit,&quot; he said slowly, his 
tail lashing back and forth in a steady rhythm. &quot;Last I checked, the 
orbital wobble period for Essence was on the order of one millimeter 
every eight hours. Even taking into account a sudden change in the 
local gravity field, I fail to see how the period would increase 
drastically.&quot; 

There was a sudden silence from the speaker. &quot;You know....&quot; 

K&#39;tal gently moved Ji&#39;an aside and leaned over the microphone. 
&quot;Listen, Chief, I&#39;m giving you the same order I gave the cadet. If you 
have a thought, I want to hear it, no matter how odd. Start talking,&quot; 
he ordered. 

&quot;Well, sir, could be one of three things. One, the laser receiver is 
in subtle motion and keeps losing track of the return beam. That&#39;s a 
non-starter as we&#39;d have been able to detect any wobble on the ground 
station.&quot; 

K&#39;tal nodded. &quot;Keep going.&quot; 

There was a faint scratching sound from the speaker as a chin was 
rubbed. &quot;Two, the whole satellite could have a sudden wobble to it. 
That&#39;s definitely possible, as intertia isn&#39;t easily bled off in 
space, but I&#39;m inclined to doubt that&#39;s the case. If it was hit by 
something, like a micro-meteorite, we would also know about it, and 
I&#39;m not seeing any unusual readings from the system.&quot; 

The commander shared an uneasy glance with D&#39;Nina and Ji&#39;an. &quot;And the 
third option?&quot; 

&quot;That would be that the mirrored array is realigning itself in 
reference to the target, which I find slightly bothersome as both the 
mirror and the target are essentially stationary in relation to one 
another. Unless....&quot; he said, then trailed off. 

K&#39;tal frowned and was about to verbally prod the chief engineer when a 
burst of profanity emerged from the speaker. K&#39;tal blinked and felt 
his blood temperature drop by twenty degrees. &quot;Talk to me, Chief.&quot; 

&quot;Unless you&#39;re tracking a moving target,&quot; the speaker replied flatly. 

K&#39;tal said nothing as he turned his attention back to the blinking 
yellow light on his control console. A simple touch would open a panel 
that housed the physical trigger mechanism, a traditional pistol-grip 
with a pull-back safety to arm the device and a simple trigger to 
close the firing circuit. 

&quot;Tactical,&quot; he said in an emotionless tone. &quot;Is the Number 2 Orbital 
Bombardment Range moving?&quot; 

Everyone exchanged glances at the question. &quot;No, sir, the target range 
is currently stationary,&quot; the tactical officer replied, trying not to 
feel like a fool for stating the obvious. 

&quot;Engineering, is the mirror still correcting for target drift?&quot; 

There was a slight pause. &quot;Yes sir, the mirror is still making a small 
adjustment every thirty seconds.&quot; 

&quot;Lieutenant Asrial, you are one of my best and most experienced 
computer operators. What is your professional evaluation of the 
onboard systems on the Essence satellite?&quot; 

Asrial blinked at the sudden question and choose her words very 
carefully. &quot;Sir, we physically do not have a functioning crypto-linker 
installed, nor do we have a certified wave-matrix guide in place. I 
cannot verify with complete and total accuracy the state of the 
computer on the satellite. It is possible that the computer could be 
compromised.&quot; 

K&#39;tal closed his eyes. &quot;Tactical, are there any large moving objects 
in the general vicinity of the target coordinates that are moving at a 
speed that would require a targeting correction every thirty seconds?&quot; 

&quot;One moment, sir,&quot; Tactical replied. 

&quot;Are you thinking what I&#39;m thinking?&quot; D&#39;Nina asked. 

&quot;I hope not, Chief,&quot; K&#39;tal replied, &quot;I really really hope not.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, there are no moving targets in the mountain range area. I have, 
however, identified one such object in a different location.&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s hear it,&quot; the commander said as his stomach turned to lead. 

&quot;Long-distance radar networks identify it as the V&#39;ral, a 
Vresh&#39;tan-class airborne carrier,&quot; the officer said as he read his 
display. &quot;It is currently two hundred miles west of the demarcation 
line between the Eastern Frontier and the Outreaches, bearing two 
seven six at a height of twenty-four angels.&quot; 

Dragoon Commander K&#39;tal looked up at the ceiling and started to 
quietly cuss out the carrier, the satellite, Internal Review, his 
chain of command, the military, the three moons, the universe, and 
life as a whole. It was a lengthy litany that impressed almost 
everyone in Operations that he could do such a thing and not repeat 
himself once during the entire event. 

&quot;Not literally, I trust?&quot; Master Chief D&#39;Nina asked calmly when K&#39;tal 
finally fell silent. 

&quot;My apologies, Master Chief,&quot; K&#39;tal said wearily. &quot;If things were a 
bit complicated before, it&#39;s ten times worse now. Ji&#39;an, do you have a 
moment?&quot; 

The forest-green Felinoid blinked and stepped over next to him. K&#39;tal 
quietly muttered instructions in his ear and he nodded in 
understanding. He flexed his hands for a moment, unintentionally 
displaying his claws in a move that unsettled Ael&#39;ien before climbing 
back into the depths of the control console he had been working on all 
day. 

&quot;K&#39;tal to Engineering.&quot; 

&quot;Venta,&quot; the voice from the speaker replied warily. He had heard every 
word of K&#39;tal&#39;s outburst of profanity and was leery as to what was 
going to happen next. 

&quot;Stand down the cannon,&quot; K&#39;tal instructed. &quot;Bleed off the coils, pull 
the primary back, unload and secure the shell, and lock the housing in 
the open position.&quot; 

&quot;Disarm the cannon, aye sir,&quot; the engineer replied wearily. &quot;Okay, 
kids, you heard the man,&quot; the voice was heard saying before the 
circuit closed. 

&quot;Maybe I should send him something for a headache,&quot; K&#39;tal mused to 
himself as he secured his terminal. He jumped along with the rest of 
Operations when there was a violent spark from inside the dismembered 
console and the Felinoid tail that was hanging out suddenly went as 
rigid as steel, the black-banded green fur sticking out at right 
angles to the skin beneath it. 

Asrial snarled a curse as she grabbed the base of the tail with both 
hands and jerked Ji&#39;an out from the console&#39;s innards. The Felinoid 
landed hard on his haunches with a wild-eyed glazed look on his face, 
his whiskers scorched with carbon and a puff of smoke drifting up from 
the ends. 

&quot;Ji&#39;an, you idiot, that was NOT what I had in mind,&quot; K&#39;tal growled as 
he stepped aside to let an officer trained in field medicine get a 
closer look. 

Ji&#39;an coughed up a lungful of smoke and shook his head rapidly, making 
a weak growling noise. &quot;Accident,&quot; he replied as both Asrial and the 
on-duty medical officer looked him over. &quot;Whiskers hit an open 
circuit.&quot; 

&quot;Sir, we just lost our communications link with Essence and T&#39;Cer,&quot; 
the Communications lieutenant reported. 

K&#39;tal glanced over at the red lights on his display. &quot;Well, it&#39;s a 
closed circuit now. Right idea, wrong method. Thank you regardless, 
Chief. Now go haul your tail over to Medical and make sure you didn&#39;t 
fry anything else.&quot; 

The forest-green Felinoid rose unsteadily to his feet. &quot;Sir,&quot; he said 
in acknowledgement as he was led out of Operations by the medical 
officer. 

&quot;Now what?&quot; D&#39;Nina asked. 

&quot;I&#39;m terminating this drill,&quot; K&#39;tal replied flatly as he keyed in a 
few commands on his console. &quot;Computer, recognize Dragoon K&#39;tal, 
commander, primary authority for phase transformation.&quot; 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized,&quot; the monotone voice replied at once. 

&quot;Initiate automated reverse-evolution to Phase Zero status.&quot; 

&quot;Require concurrence.&quot; 

D&#39;Nina raised an eyebrow. &quot;Internal Review is going to want to 
question you at length about this,&quot; she commented. 

K&#39;tal snorted. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be the first time they&#39;ve probed me like a 
woman at the gynecologist&#39;s office. Uhh, no offense, Chief, ma&#39;am,&quot; he 
said quickly when he saw the look of severe unamusement on the faces 
of both D&#39;Nina and Ael&#39;ien. 

&quot;Computer,&quot; D&#39;Nina said in a tone best described as glacial. 
&quot;Recognize Dragoon D&#39;Nina, master chief, secondary authority for phase 
transformation.&quot; 

&quot;Voiceprint recognized.&quot; 

&quot;Initiate automated reverse-evolution to Phase Zero status.&quot; 

&quot;Compliance,&quot; the computer responded and started to send signals to 
all the appropriate hardware. 

&quot;Unless it&#39;s from a division-level officer or higher, I&#39;m not 
available,&quot; K&#39;tal said as he motioned for Ael&#39;ien to follow him. &quot;I 
will be in my office. Master Chief D&#39;Nina has control of Operations, 
both the VBF and alert systems are cancelled unless she has a reason 
for keeping them active.&quot; 

&quot;Which I don&#39;t,&quot; D&#39;Nina said with a shrug. 

&quot;Great job, everyone,&quot; K&#39;tal said to the Operations room in general as 
he ushered Ael&#39;ien into his office. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what exactly we just 
did, or didn&#39;t do, but I intend to find out. Until then, just keep an 
extra eye out for anything untoward by anyone else. Carry on,&quot; he 
added as he stepped into his office and closed the door behind him. 

&quot;What the hell just happened?&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked as K&#39;tal plopped into his 
chair and leaned back to stare up at the ceiling. 

&quot;Truthfully? I think we just avoided having our k&#39;vesan caught in the 
rakketh trap,&quot; he said bluntly. &quot;We get an order to fire the cannon, 
for some odd reason we don&#39;t have a verified signal to the satellite 
computer, we are given the coordinates for a known testing ground, yet 
the orbital mirror acts like it&#39;s tracking something else entirely, 
and the only moving object in this hemisphere that fits the pattern is 
a carrier used by a returning general who scares the living navidshi 
out of everyone, myself included. Now tell me that doesn&#39;t literally 
raise the hair on the back of your neck,&quot; he concluded. 

&quot;It does,&quot; the telepath admitted. 

&quot;Think it&#39;s Rune?&quot; K&#39;tal asked. 

Ael&#39;ien chewed on the edge of her lip. &quot;Who else could it be?&quot; 

&quot;Rune, Admiral Si&#39;ren, your friend Al&#39;vexi, any one of the regional or 
divisional commanders, anyone with high-level access to the computer 
on the satellite....&quot; he said slowly as he ticked off his fingers one 
by one. 

&quot;I get the picture,&quot; Ael&#39;ien sighed quietly as she rubbed her temples. 
&quot;What we&#39;re going to need is solid proof, however, if this is going to 
go anywhere. And that includes how you&#39;re going to handle Internal 
Review.&quot; 

&quot;Please, IR can kiss my ptanka,&quot; K&#39;tal rolled his eyes. &quot;If nothing 
else, I can show them that the uplink to Essence was never repaired to 
begin with and thus made the whole affair unreliable.&quot; 

&quot;By having Ji&#39;an disable the uplink?&quot; Ael&#39;ien asked with a raised 
eyebrow. 

&quot;Nope. Every single person in Operations can truthfully swear before 
any review board that the circuit board containing the crypto-linker 
was never physically connected at any point in this exercise,&quot; he 
replied. 

Ael&#39;ien chuckled quietly. &quot;That much is the honest truth,&quot; she 
admitted. 

K&#39;tal stretched. &quot;See? It&#39;s not IR I&#39;m worried about.&quot; 

&quot;So what are you worried about?&quot; 

K&#39;tal sat up and looked her squarely in the eyes. &quot;What worries me is, 
now that this trap has failed, what trap is going to be laid next, and 
for whom?&quot; he said darkly. 

The ominous silence in response brought a chill to them both.

Ami approached the tree very carefully, not entirely sure what to make 
of the blonde&#39;s somewhat erratic movements. She knew that she was 
listening to a portable music player and could see part of the wire 
between the device and the tiny earpiece, but had absolutely no idea 
what sort of music she could be listening to that would incite her to 
thrash her head around like that. 

Mina looked up and smiled as Ami sat down a few feet away. &quot;Hey there, 
girl, how&#39;s it going?&quot; she said cheerfully. 

&quot;I&#39;ve had better days,&quot; Ami said warily. &quot;What are you listening to?&quot; 

Mina grinned as she held out the other earpiece. Ami looked at it for 
a moment as if it were a snake and she was trying to decide if it was 
poisonous or not. She carefully reached out to pick it up and blinked 
when she could feel the rhythmic vibration of sound coming from the 
speaker. This is probably a bad idea, she thought to herself as she 
leaned over to put the tiny speaker to her ear. 

&quot;...DIG through the ditches and BURN through the witches, I SLAM in 
the back of my DRAG-U-LA....&quot; 

&quot;Spoilsport,&quot; Mina chided as the speaker went flying out of Ami&#39;s 
grasp like it was a hot potato. She reduced the volume a few decibels 
and leaned back against the trunk of the ancient oak tree. 

&quot;What was that noise?&quot; Ami protested as she rubbed her ear furiously. 

&quot;Quality music,&quot; Mina said with an impish grin. 

Ami gave her a look that needed no translation. &quot;Rock and roll?&quot; she 
ventured. 

&quot;Heavy metal,&quot; Mina replied. &quot;Dragula, by Rob Zombie.&quot; 

&quot;Zombies?&quot; a voice said in amusement. 

&quot;Hello, Rei,&quot; Ami said as she rubbed her ear again. 

The priestess sat down with a chuckle. &quot;I heard from Leda that Luna 
was in the area and wanted to talk to us, but about zombies?&quot; 

&quot;Rob Zombie,&quot; Mina said as she closed her eyes. &quot;Heavy metal 
musician.&quot; 

Rei just shook her head. &quot;You and music. Almost as bad as meatball 
head and food.&quot; 

&quot;I heard that,&quot; Serena grumbled as she and Leda joined the group, 
finding comfortable places to sit down. &quot;I&#39;m not as bad as you think, 
pyro.&quot; 

&quot;Let&#39;s not start this one again,&quot; Leda growled, &quot;I&#39;m having a bad 
enough day as it is.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I heard about that,&quot; Mina said as she switched off her music 
and sat up. &quot;Word is you almost wiped the floor with someone.&quot; 

The brunette sighed heavily and looked up at the sky while Serena and 
Rei exchanged glances. &quot;I&#39;m gonna kill that little gossiping weasel,&quot; 
Leda said dangerously. &quot;Cat,&quot; she added as she saw motion in the tree. 

There was a snapping sound and Mina immediately ducked, holding her 
arms over her head. Half a second later, an inky shadow dropped from 
an overhead branch amid a flurry of leaves and landed squarely on the 
blonde&#39;s head. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Mina protested as the new arrival hopped to the ground. 

Luna gave her a bashful look. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Mina, but I slipped off the 
branch just as I went to leap,&quot; she explained apologetically. She 
paused for a moment before adding, &quot;Thank you for breaking my fall.&quot; 

&quot;So what&#39;s the problem?&quot; Ami interjected quickly before Mina could 
come up with a suitable reply. 

Luna sat back and tried to remove a leaf that had gotten snared on her 
claws. &quot;Well, it seems that we have company....&quot; she started to say 
before being interrupted by another snapping sound from up above. 

Mina flinched again, but the suddenly flurry of leaves was from 
further out on the branch. There was a startled yelp as a small fluffy 
mass bounced off of Rei&#39;s head and tumbled into her lap. 

&quot;OW! What is this, Relive Newton&#39;s Apple Day?&quot; Rei demanded sourly as 
she rubbed the sore spot on her head. 

&quot;Ouch,&quot; the white cat groaned as he uncurled himself, &quot;That hurt. A 
lot.&quot; 

Mina sighed as she reached over to pick him up. &quot;Artemis, you dingbat, 
what&#39;d you do that for?&quot; 

&quot;Slipped,&quot; Artemis said. &quot;I was aiming for Leda&#39;s lap, to be honest, 
but I think that branch isn&#39;t what it used to be. Not springy enough.&quot; 

&quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Leda said dryly. &quot;Just be glad Rei has a hard head.&quot; 

&quot;Excuse me!&quot; 

Serena just looked at the two cats. &quot;If this is any indication of what 
the rest of the day is like, I wanna go back to class,&quot; she muttered. 

Leda chuckled. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d hear you say that,&quot; she commented. 

&quot;And where have you been?&quot; the black cat demanded of her counterpart. 

&quot;None of your business,&quot; Artemis shot back. &quot;I got your message and 
I&#39;m here on time, so the details aren&#39;t important.&quot; 

Everyone blinked at the flat reply and exchanged glances. &quot;You&#39;re not 
getting into something you shouldn&#39;t be, are you?&quot; Mina inquired with 
an edged tone as she scratched behind his ears. 

&quot;You&#39;re one to talk,&quot; both Leda and Artemis muttered at the same time. 

The blonde blinked and looked at Leda. &quot;What&#39;d I do to you?&quot; 

&quot;Can we get on with this?&quot; Ami said in an unusual display of 
impatience. &quot;I have studying to do.&quot; Everyone blinked again and Ami 
sighed very quietly. &quot;Luna, what sort of company are we supposed to 
expect?&quot; 

&quot;Please don&#39;t say the Negaverse,&quot; Leda added. &quot;I think I&#39;ve had my 
fill of denizens for quite some time. Not counting the crew we have 
parked in the cathedral, of course.&quot; 

Ami and Mina looked at one another as the same thought occurred to 
them both. The blonde smirked and the blue-haired vampire glanced away 
with a faint blush. 

The exchange went unnoticed by everyone else. &quot;Does this have to do 
with what you and Darian did last night?&quot; Serena asked her feline 
mentor. 

Luna nodded. &quot;Exactly.&quot; 

&quot;Start at the beginning,&quot; Leda said with a sigh. 

&quot;Well, last night Dyvach was able to convey a precognitive dream of 
sorts to Darian. It said that he needed to pick me up and take a bunch 
of towels with us to meet a few people by the lake,&quot; Luna explained. 

&quot;Already I don&#39;t like this,&quot; Rei muttered quietly. 

Luna ignored the comment. &quot;We were told to expect the rest of Serena&#39;s 
royal court....&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; six voices demanded in unison. 

&quot;...And got there just as they teleported above the surface of the 
lake,&quot; Luna finished without missing a beat. &quot;We fished them out of 
the lake and now they&#39;re at the cathedral waiting for you five to get 
out of school.&quot; 

There was a deathly silence for a few moments as everyone blinked 
hard. &quot;What others?&quot; Serena said slowly. 

&quot;Sailor Uranus, Sailor Pluto, and Sailor Neptune,&quot; Luna replied. &quot;They 
were with us in the Moon Kingdom when the Negaverse attacked. I was 
never sure why they weren&#39;t reincarnated along with the five of you, 
but now they&#39;re back again.&quot; 

The five girls exchanged glances while Artemis sat up and frowned. 
&quot;Why am I having such a hard time remembering details about them?&quot; he 
complained to Luna. &quot;I remember Uranus and Neptune, but there&#39;s 
something about Pluto that I can&#39;t quite pin down....&quot; 

&quot;Wings?&quot; Luna prompted. 

Everyone blinked hard as Artemis surrendered to a rather protracted 
full- body shiver. &quot;I had forgotten about that aspect of her,&quot; he 
muttered. 

&quot;Back up and start over,&quot; Leda sighed. &quot;You lost me when you got to 
the royal court part.&quot; 

&quot;So there are three other Sailor Scouts now?&quot; Ami asked. 

Luna nodded. &quot;Yes, there are. And as soon as school is out for the 
day, we&#39;re going to go meet them at the cathedral.&quot; 

&quot;So tell us about them,&quot; Mina prompted, drawing nods from everyone 
else. 

&quot;Well, what I can say is.... meow,&quot; she said suddenly as she looked up 
over Serena&#39;s shoulder. 

The girls blinked in surprise at the sudden change in the cat&#39;s 
demeanor and turned to see what she was looking at. &quot;Great,&quot; Leda 
muttered beneath her breath as the redhead approached the group. 

&quot;Hi, Molly,&quot; Serena said as her best friend drew close. 

&quot;I was wondering where you were,&quot; Molly said, slightly out of breath. 
She blinked as she saw Luna sitting on the ground and a white cat 
being cuddled in Mina&#39;s lap. &quot;I see you found Luna. And who do you 
have there, Mina?&quot; 

Mina smiled. &quot;This is my cat Artemis,&quot; she said cheerfully as she 
gently scratched his ears. &quot;Apparently he followed me to school as 
well.&quot; 

&quot;Meow,&quot; Artemis said flatly. 

&quot;I&#39;m not interrupting anything, am I?&quot; Molly inquired as she looked 
for a place to sit down. 

&quot;Not really,&quot; Rei said casually as everyone discreetly exchanged 
glances. &quot;We were just trying to figure out what it is about cats that 
make them want to follow you to school like dogs now and then.&quot; 

&quot;Mrrrrow,&quot; Luna muttered dourly as Leda chuckled and picked her up. 

&quot;Bah, she just probably wanted some loving attention,&quot; she said 
gleefully as she gently stroked Luna&#39;s dark fur. 

&quot;Hey, I pay attention to her,&quot; Serena protested. 

&quot;Which is why she followed you to school, meatball head,&quot; Rei replied. 
&quot;She knows you&#39;re easy when it comes to pets.&quot; 

&quot;That was wrong, Rei,&quot; Leda chuckled. &quot;Accurate, but wrong.&quot; 

Serena pouted. &quot;At least I have a cat who loves me. What do you have, 
a pair of ravens?&quot; 

Rei frowned. &quot;They&#39;re not pets, they just live there and help keep the 
pest population under control a lot more effectively than a cat can.&quot; 

&quot;Meow,&quot; Luna muttered in protest. 

Molly just shook her head as Serena and Rei started in on yet another 
heated argument. She glanced over her shoulder at Ami and wasn&#39;t 
surprised in the slightest to see that she had her nose buried in a 
science textbook. She looked back at Leda and Mina, both focusing 
their attention on the pair of cats in their respective laps. 

&quot;Hey, is that a crescent mark on his forehead?&quot; Molly suddenly asked 
Mina as she gestured to the white cat. 

The blonde blinked. &quot;Yeah, the vet said it&#39;s just an abberation with 
his fur coloring,&quot; she explained, making a slight face as claws were 
discreetly extended and lightly scratched across the skin of her leg. 

&quot;Strange, Luna has the same marking,&quot; Molly observed as she studied 
the black feline still being petted by Leda. 

&quot;What about Luna?&quot; Serena asked, suddenly distracted from her argument 
by the mention of her cat. 

&quot;We think they&#39;re related somehow,&quot; Mina explained casually. &quot;Hey, 
hey, hey, watch the claws,&quot; she said gently as she picked Artemis up 
and moved him to a more comfortable position. &quot;The crescent marking,&quot; 
she said to Serena. 

&quot;Oh, that....&quot; Serena said with a slight edge of nervousness. 

&quot;Strange cat, strange owner,&quot; Rei smirked. 

&quot;Birdbrain,&quot; Serena shot back. 

&quot;No brain.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re just jealous because Luna is cute and fun to play with, and 
you have to spend your afternoons washing raven poop off the sidewalk 
at your grandfather&#39;s temple.&quot; 

Rei&#39;s eyes blazed. &quot;Of course a blonde like you wouldn&#39;t be able to 
have an appreciation of the rewards of hard work!&quot; 

&quot;Hey, watch it,&quot; Mina protested as she put her earphones back on and 
did her best to tune out the argument. Artemis just sighed quietly to 
himself and curled up in a small ball of fur in her lap. 

&quot;What&#39;s so rewarding about having to spend most of your time working?&quot; 

Rei smirked. &quot;Satisfaction knowing that you&#39;ve done something useful.&quot; 

&quot;By becoming a walking pooper-scooper?&quot; 

&quot;Enough, you two,&quot; Leda sighed. 

&quot;You stay out of this,&quot; Rei growled. &quot;Meatball head here still doesn&#39;t 
get it. Not every job is pleasant or easy, but that still doesn&#39;t make 
it any less worthwhile to do and do right.&quot; 

The brunette raised an eyebrow and gave her a mild look. &quot;She&#39;ll learn 
in time, Rei,&quot; she said evenly. &quot;You get it, I get it, Ami gets it, I 
don&#39;t know if Mina gets it yet but still.... no need to argue so 
loudly.&quot; 

&quot;Get what?&quot; Mina blinked as she refocused on the present. 

&quot;A clue,&quot; Rei said tartly. 

Mina just rolled her eyes and went back to listening to her music, 
idly running her fingers through Artemis&#39;s soft fur. 

&quot;You&#39;re one to talk,&quot; Serena grumbled. 

&quot;I&#39;m doing a lot better than you in class!&quot; 

&quot;Only because you&#39;ve been leaning on Ami for study help!&quot; 

&quot;And you don&#39;t?!&quot; 

&quot;Leave me out of this,&quot; Ami sighed quietly as she tried to refocus on 
her studies. 

&quot;Did you understand what Mr. Meyers was talking about in physics lab?&quot; 
Leda quickly asked in an attempt to interrupt the argument. 

Ami sighed again and looked up at her, a classic &#39;You have to be 
kidding me, right?&#39; look on her features. &quot;Of course I understood it,&quot; 
she replied. 

&quot;Of course,&quot; Rei muttered, drawing an amused look from Molly and a 
dark look from Ami. 

&quot;Hush,&quot; Leda told her, then turned back to Ami. &quot;Can you explain...?&quot; 

&quot;No,&quot; Ami said abruptly as she stood up and gathered her books 
together, causing everyone to blink hard. &quot;I&#39;m a bit busy trying to 
study, which is very hard to accomplish with all this noise. I&#39;ll be 
in the library,&quot; she said brusquely and quickly left without another 
word. 

&quot;I think we upset her,&quot; Serena said quietly. 

&quot;I think she was already upset,&quot; Molly suggested. 

&quot;Can you blame her?&quot; Leda growled. &quot;I warned you two to knock it off.&quot; 

&quot;Mrrrow,&quot; Luna said quietly from Leda&#39;s lap. 

Rei snorted. &quot;She&#39;ll be alright.&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s been in a bad mood all day,&quot; Molly observed carefully. 

Serena blinked. &quot;Why&#39;s that?&quot; 

&quot;Gossip,&quot; Mina said from behind closed eyelids. &quot;It seems everyone has 
been talking about her all morning long.&quot; 

Molly and Leda exchanged glances while Serena and Rei frowned. 
&quot;Talking about what?&quot; Rei asked, suddenly wary. 

&quot;Something about a boyfriend,&quot; Mina replied casually. &quot;I find that 
just a touch hard to believe, to be honest.&quot; 

&quot;She admitted it,&quot; Molly replied. 

Mina&#39;s eyes snapped open as she yanked the earphones out. &quot;She what?&quot; 
she blurted out as two sets of feline ears suddely darted straight up. 
Rei almost fell over in shock and Serena&#39;s blue eyes suddenly doubled 
in size. 

Leda sighed. &quot;She basically admitted in front of Melvin, of all 
people, that she&#39;s got a boyfriend. One older than she is,&quot; she added 
with a slight but discernable emphasis. 

&quot;Oh, crap,&quot; Mina said quietly. She knew about Tolaris, of course, but 
still wanted to give the impression that it was fresh news to her. 
&quot;When did this happen?&quot; 

&quot;Earlier today,&quot; Molly said with a slightly puzzled look on her face. 
&quot;I thought you three knew already,&quot; she ventured as she studied the 
shocked looks on their faces. &quot;I mean, aren&#39;t the five of you pretty 
close friends?&quot; 

&quot;Mrrrrrrr,&quot; Artemis purred quietly, his whiskers twitching. 

&quot;It wasn&#39;t something she wanted discussed,&quot; Mina replied carefully. 

&quot;I am going to find that little gossiping inchworm,&quot; Leda growled very 
quietly as she looked around the schoolyard. &quot;And when I do, I am 
going to make him wish he had never even heard of the word 
grapevine....&quot; 

&quot;Take it easy,&quot; Rei cautioned. 

&quot;Meow,&quot; Luna seconded as she flicked her tail back and forth. 

Leda glanced down at the ball of black fur in her lap and sighed. 
&quot;He&#39;s just so maddening at times,&quot; she grumped as she resumed stroking 
Luna. &quot;At least Mina has half a clue as to what NOT to gossip about. 
Usually,&quot; she added with a glare. 

&quot;I told you that wasn&#39;t me,&quot; Mina protested. 

&quot;So what are we going to do?&quot; Serena asked. 

&quot;Why do we have to do anything?&quot; Rei countered. &quot;She had to have known 
that people would talk if she spoke out about having a boyfriend.&quot; 

Leda gave her an odd look. &quot;For someone who spends a lot of time 
sitting next to small fires, you sure do have a cold streak in you. 
They were talking about it before she said anything, and she only 
spoke up in an effort to set the record straight.&quot; 

Rei snorted quietly. &quot;Oh, please. This is Ami we&#39;re talking about, she 
always knows what she&#39;s doing as well as possible repercussions of 
doing it.&quot; 

&quot;Hey, Molly?&quot; Mina spoke up suddenly, &quot;When did you hear about this?&quot; 

The redhead blinked and exchanged glances with Serena before blushing 
a mild shade of pink. &quot;I heard a rumor the other day and sort of 
managed to weasel the truth out of Serena....&quot; 

&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Serena protested with a blush of embarassment. 

&quot;Way to go, meatball head,&quot; Rei sighed. 

&quot;Oh, and I suppose you&#39;ve never made a mistake, pyro?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve never blown anyone&#39;s secret about having a boyfriend.&quot; 

&quot;At least some of us can find a boyfriend,&quot; Serena countered. 

Both Mina and Leda blinked hard. &quot;Foul ball, Serena,&quot; Mina replied. 

Rei gave Serena a neutral look, her face slipping into an 
expressionless mask that concealed her emotions from everyone else. 
&quot;That has no bearing on your inability to keep a secret,&quot; she said 
evenly. 

Serena sighed heavily. &quot;Yeah, so I made a mistake,&quot; she said quietly. 
&quot;Ami knew I slipped, I already apologized to her, and she knows that 
the rumor was started before I told Molly.&quot; 

Rei silently got to her feet. &quot;Just bear in mind that friendships are 
known to have been broken over less,&quot; she said quietly and left the 
group. 

Serena blinked hard and looked at everyone else. &quot;What gives?&quot; 

&quot;I think that comment about a boyfriend stung just a little too 
deeply,&quot; Leda muttered as she scooped up Luna and passed her over to 
Serena. &quot;We know how you meant it, Serena, but you really need to 
learn to think just a little bit more before opening your mouth. Here, 
have a cat.&quot; 

&quot;Brrrow,&quot; Luna purred in soft protest as she was dumped in Serena&#39;s 
lap. 

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Mina inquired warily as Leda got to her feet. 

&quot;I&#39;m gonna go see if I can find Melvin and turn him into a pretzel 
before class starts,&quot; the brunette said flatly. 

&quot;You have five minutes,&quot; Mina replied as she glanced at her music 
player. 

Leda snorted in distain. &quot;Bah, takes longer than that just to dish out 
a decent set of bruises,&quot; she muttered. &quot;I&#39;ll have to have a discusion 
with him later. See you after class,&quot; she said with a distracted wave 
and walked off. 

Serena looked down at Luna for a moment before looking up at Molly. 
&quot;You think we should warn him?&quot; 

The redhead just sighed and looked up at the sky. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I 
think Ami already scared him straight, but you never know. Which is 
rather scary in of itself,&quot; she added. 

Mina chuckled as she stuffed her music player in her backpack. &quot;Oh, 
cheer up. Leda is a wonderful person when she&#39;s not stressing out 
about something. I don&#39;t blame her for getting a bit out of sorts with 
everyone talking about Ami her behind her back. Just give her a few 
days and a lot of space, she&#39;ll go back to being her usual, only 
mildly aggressive self soon enough.&quot; 

&quot;You sure about that?&quot; Molly ventured. 

Mina paused for a moment and shrugged. &quot;Not really,&quot; she admitted. 
&quot;But then again, what choice do we have? Okay, kitty, off you go,&quot; she 
said as she picked up Artemis and set him high on the trunk of the oak 
tree. &quot;I have to go back to class now, so stay in the area and be 
good.&quot; 

&quot;Meow,&quot; Artemis muttered darkly as he preened his paws. 

&quot;Is he going to be okay out here?&quot; Molly wondered as Mina picked up 
her backpack. 

&quot;Oh, sure,&quot; Mina replied cheerfully. &quot;This isn&#39;t the first time that 
he followed me to school. He&#39;ll just stick around up in the tree until 
it&#39;s time to go home. Which is probably what Luna is going to do as 
well,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Mrrow,&quot; Luna said with a look of patient suffering. 

&quot;Come on, Blondie,&quot; Mina said to Serena, &quot;Time to get back to work.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t remind me,&quot; Serena replied as she set Luna on the tree next to 
Artemis and briefly scratched both sets of ears. &quot;You ready, Mol?&quot; 

Molly nodded and rose to her feet. &quot;As ready as I&#39;ll ever be.&quot; 

&quot;Once more, dear Watson, unto the breech,&quot; Mina quoted with a wink and 
a grin at the cats before leading her friends back towards the school. 

&quot;Well, that was unpleasant,&quot; Luna muttered when everyone else was out 
of earshot. &quot;One more meow and I would have had to claw somebody.&quot; 

&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; Artemis grumbled. &quot;Sounds to me like Ami has a lot 
on her plate to deal with right now.&quot; 

Luna sighed and started to preen her tail. &quot;Well, hopefully we can 
take her mind off her issues tonight when we introduce them to the 
other Scouts.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s been bugging me,&quot; the white cat replied. &quot;I know I should have 
a lot more memories of them in the Moon Kingdom, yet I can&#39;t quite 
seem to get the right pictures in my head.&quot; 

&quot;It must be the effects of the stasis fields,&quot; she said with yet 
another sigh. &quot;I kept shocking myself by how much I had forgotten 
about them.&quot; 

&quot;You remembered after having your memory jogged, right?&quot; he prompted. 

&quot;Well, yes....&quot; 

He shrugged. &quot;Shouldn&#39;t be too bad, then.&quot; 

Luna raised an eyebrow. &quot;You forgot that Lady Pluto was half-demon and 
could manifest wings,&quot; she observed. &quot;That&#39;s not exactly a minor 
detail.&quot; 

Artemis shuddered again. &quot;That&#39;s not something I wanted to remember,&quot; 
he said dourly. &quot;I know she&#39;s a decent person, but that she also has a 
bit of a dark side to her. The trick this evening, however, is going 
to get our bunch of Sailor Scouts to remember.&quot; 

The black cat shook her head. &quot;That&#39;s not going to happen and you know 
it,&quot; she replied sadly. &quot;Remember what we had to go through just to 
get them to remember about the Moon Kingdom?&quot; 

&quot;Maybe we&#39;ll get lucky tonight?&quot; he asked hopefully. 

Luna peered over her shoulder at the school. &quot;I&#39;m not sure today is 
what you would call a lucky day so far,&quot; she replied. 

&quot;Day isn&#39;t over yet,&quot; Artemis said with a yawn. 

&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; Luna muttered, &quot;There&#39;s still time for it to get 
worse.&quot;

*





* 

&quot;She&#39;s late,&quot; she said flatly as she paced back and forth in the small 
chamber loaded with high-powered machinery and electronics. The 
stylized red patch on her right breast and the silver emblem on her 
shoulders denoted her rank as a Brigadier of the Red Wings, the elite 
airborne combat division. &quot;She should have sent the return signal by 
now.&quot; 

A massive armored figure grunted from the far corner of the room. 
&quot;Give her time, Sor&#39;en,&quot; he said, his rumbling voice emerging from the 
depths of his helmet as a hollow but forceful echo. &quot;You know as well 
as I do that she has a lot of work to do.&quot; 

Sor&#39;en sighed and looked up at him, privately wondering yet again what 
he looked like behind the concealing armor. &quot;You&#39;re not much help,&quot; 
she said to him. 

General Ar&#39;kanis laughed very softly, a low-pitched haunting noise 
that raised the hair on Sor&#39;en&#39;s arms. &quot;Would you have me pull her 
back now and risk execution if I interrupted something crucial?&quot; he 
said in bemusement. 

She sighed quietly. &quot;Of course not. Freya, any signals yet?&quot; 

The slender young woman tending to the master control console looked 
up at her. &quot;No, there hasn&#39;t,&quot; she said softly. &quot;I&#39;ve been monitoring 
all of the communication sidebands as well.&quot; 

Sor&#39;en ran her fingers through her snowy white hair and resumed 
pacing, much to the amusement of Ar&#39;kanis. &quot;This is crazy,&quot; she 
muttered. &quot;She&#39;s been gone all morning long. Who knows what could have 
happened to her?&quot; 

&quot;I think she can take care of herself,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly. 

&quot;She&#39;s an army by herself, but she&#39;s not invincible,&quot; So&#39;ren muttered. 

&quot;Tell her that,&quot; the armored general suggested. 

So&#39;ren rolled her ash-gray eyes. &quot;I&#39;ve tried,&quot; she said dourly. &quot;She 
just won&#39;t listen to me.&quot; 

&quot;Incoming signal,&quot; Freya said softly as she powered up the main 
platform. &quot;Beam reversal commencing.&quot; 

The brigadier immediately crossed the room to lean on the cold metal 
rail that surrounded the raised dias. The floor tiles began to glow 
white with raw energy as the receiver node began to emit a series of 
blue sparks. 

Freya manipulated the controls for a few seconds before grabbing the 
main switch with both hands. &quot;Convergence,&quot; she reported as the switch 
was pulled down into the receive position. 

A jagged line of whirling blue energy ripped through the air above the 
platform before spiraling open into a glittering maelstrom of tiny 
energized particles. The pinpoints of light were drawn together and 
took on a humanoid shape as the rift closed just as quickly as it had 
opened. With a final snap of blue light, the energy field faded and 
left behind the imposing figure of General Nop&#39;tera. 

The Dark General immediately fell to her knees and reached for the 
large metal pail sitting on the very edge of the platform. She yanked 
it over and promptly stuck her head in, her insides heaving as she 
fought the reflex to unload the contents of her stomach. 

Everyone waited in silence for the wave of transport-induced nausea to 
leave her body, each having been through the process themselves at 
least once before and could readily sympathize. The visible trembling 
finally subsided and the blue-skinned general was finally able to lift 
her head up. 

&quot;I think I&#39;m getting used to it,&quot; she said weakly as she stifled 
another urge to heave. &quot;This is the first time I&#39;ve been able to keep 
lunch down after the transport beam reversal.&quot; 

&quot;You had us worried,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied. &quot;You took so long to signal, I 
thought something had gone wrong.&quot; 

&quot;She had you worried,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled from the corner. &quot;The rest of 
us had a bit more faith in her.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, stop it, you two,&quot; Nop&#39;tera grumbled as she set the pail back on 
the edge of the platform and rose unsteadily to her feet. Freya 
reached out to provide support and the eternal vampire gratefully 
accepted the help. &quot;You sound like lovers having a bad week. Thank 
you, Freya.&quot; 

Sor&#39;en fumed quietly while Ar&#39;kanis chuckled. &quot;Sorry if I care enough 
about my own mother to worry,&quot; she replied with a pout. &quot;We all know 
you&#39;re probably not going to be welcomed with open arms. In private, 
at least,&quot; she amended. 

Nop&#39;tera smiled at the young girl she called her daughter. &quot;I&#39;m 
touched, Sor&#39;en, truly. However, I thought you would have learned by 
now that I am quite capable at getting myself out of whatever trouble 
that I happen to find myself in.&quot; 

&quot;Not everyone goes looking for it like you do, either,&quot; she replied. 

Nop&#39;tera sighed. &quot;That&#39;s enough, Sor&#39;en. I had business to attend to 
in the Imperial Castle that needed to be settled before my official 
arrival. What is the status of the fleet?&quot; 

&quot;The V&#39;ral is continuing on an approach vector to the Castle,&quot; 
Ar&#39;kanis spoke up. &quot;The Visage has landed in the water in the north 
ocean and will be changing course to an approach vector to the D&#39;Mal 
seaport in two hours. The Veil is still airborne and is scheduled to 
land at the airfield near the Southern Division Headquarters in six 
hours.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera nodded as she steadied herself under her own power. &quot;And what 
of the subsurface groups?&quot; 

&quot;The Green group will be forming up behind the Visage when it goes to 
make the approach,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied. &quot;The Blue group commander still 
hasn&#39;t made her decision which port to dock at in the south ocean. She 
says she will signal with a final answer by the end of the second 
watch.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera stretched carefully, trying to work out the slight joint pain 
that always accompanied the use of the molecular transport beam. 
Although teleportation was hardly a new concept, virtually all of it 
was done with the use of psionics and warped dimensional fields. The 
device she was using was strictly mechanical in nature, a specialized 
field of energy that ripped apart solid objects down to the atomic 
level and sent the particle stream through a matrix of quantum energy 
to self-assemble in another location. The energy signature was unique 
enough as to not be either noticed by sensors or become affected by 
the anti-dimensional energy wards layered around most important 
military structures. 

She watched with interest as Freya left her side and started to shut 
down the transport machinery. Nop&#39;tera didn&#39;t often use the device for 
personal use, as it had originally been designed with cargo in mind. 
However, when she deemed it necessary for her molecules be &quot;squirted&quot; 
elsewhere, she only let the one person she trusted implicitly to 
handle the complex device near the main controls. She had seen herself 
what a mistake or a wrong setting could do to an object. Fortunately 
it had only been a crate of melons at the time, but the image of the 
way the jumbled molecules had reassembled would forever be seared into 
her eternal memory. 

Sor&#39;en didn&#39;t fail to take note of her mother&#39;s lingering attention on 
Freya. She knew that the beautiful young woman with pale blue hair was 
by all rights Nop&#39;tera&#39;s slave, having been taken prisoner in some 
conflict a thousand years ago, but that Nop&#39;tera tended to treat her 
more like a trusted friend. Or, if the quietly whispered rumors were 
true, a secret lover. 

&quot;How long until we make the final approach to the Imperial Castle?&quot; 
came the voice of the Dark General, cutting through Sor&#39;en&#39;s thoughts. 

&quot;Twenty-six hours,&quot; the commanding officer of the V&#39;ral replied 
evenly. &quot;We have been instructed by the Eastern Division Commander to 
maintain our present course, speed, and altitude. He also has advised 
us that his fleet of drones will continue to orbit us until we cross 
the demarcation line and enter the Central Division airspace.&quot; 

&quot;How kind of him,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said dryly. 

&quot;We could always induce a magnetic field along the hull,&quot; Sor&#39;en 
suggested lightly. &quot;Make it strong enough and it&#39;ll drive those drones 
crazy.&quot; 

&quot;And serve what purpose?&quot; Ar&#39;kanis rumbled quietly. 

&quot;Enough,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said flatly, her featureless yellow eyes narrowing 
at her daughter and her second-in-command. &quot;You two can argue later, 
but right now I&#39;ve got work to do. Sor&#39;en, have you been able to 
access the databases I specified?&quot; 

Sor&#39;en sighed quietly. &quot;The databases, yes, but most of the individual 
files that were flagged by the search worms were heavily guarded and 
highly encrypted. Communications is working on solving that issue, but 
there are still a number of files behind the security barriers that we 
are having a very difficult time bypassing.&quot; 

The vampire grunted. &quot;Who do you have working on it?&quot; 

&quot;Anyone who&#39;s not scheduled to be asleep,&quot; the brigadier replied. 

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t work them so hard, Sor&#39;en,&quot; Nop&#39;tera advised. &quot;Yes, I 
do want the files, and yesterday would have been nice, but this isn&#39;t 
a priority issue. Not yet, at least,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Yes, Mother,&quot; Sor&#39;en replied wearily. 

Nop&#39;tera chuckled quietly in amusement and kissed her forehead. 
&quot;You&#39;re becoming a fine officer,&quot; she said. &quot;We&#39;re all still learning 
better and more efficient ways of taking care of our soldiers, 
including myself.&quot; 

&quot;You have a five-thousand year advantage,&quot; the armored general spoke 
up from the corner in amusement. &quot;Commanding your soldiers in battle 
is easy. Understanding them is moderately more complicated.&quot; 

&quot;Someone ask you for dating advice again?&quot; Sor&#39;en muttered. 

There was a low rumble from the depths of his helmet. &quot;No, I was asked 
if I had any advice on the best way to deflower a virgin,&quot; he said 
with an obvious smile of amusement in his sepulchral voice. 

Nop&#39;tera laughed softly at the look on Sor&#39;en&#39;s face. &quot;And what was 
your response?&quot; she inquired. 

&quot;Bring her to me and I&#39;d show him,&quot; he replied. 

Sor&#39;en sighed and glanced over at Freya, noticing that the slave had 
finished shutting down the transport machine and was silently hovering 
right behind Nop&#39;tera&#39;s elbow, her pale violet eyes downcast. 
Everything about her is so pale, she thought as she studied the tone 
of Freya&#39;s skin. I wonder if Mother&#39;s been leeching more than just the 
blood from her veins.... 

&quot;Men,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said in obvious amusement. 

&quot;Can&#39;t live with them, can&#39;t kill them....&quot; Sor&#39;en muttered. 

&quot;You&#39;ll find someone one of these centuries,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said with a 
faint twinkle in her featureless yellow eyes. 

&quot;Find someone that you haven&#39;t interviewed or otherwise grilled before 
granting them &#39;permission&#39; to approach me?&quot; her daughter grumbled. 

&quot;She has a point,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis mentioned. &quot;I know a number of young and 
respectable men who would like to get to know her, but are deathly 
afraid of your influence or intervention.&quot; 

&quot;Like yourself?&quot; Nop&#39;tera said on pure impulse. 

Sor&#39;en rolled her eyes while Ar&#39;kanis laughed softly to himself. &quot;I am 
many things, my General, most importantly your second-in-command and 
loyal subordinate,&quot; he said to her. &quot;I respect your power, but I do 
not fear it.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera tilted her head to one side to study the figure enshrouded in 
dark armor. She knew why he always wore it, keeping himself completely 
hidden from the eyes of other denizens. She had even seen his face 
once, but that one instance was more than enough for her. She had in 
the past inflicted a wide variety of pain and suffering on her 
enemies, but had never been able to fully match the bitter cruelty 
that could result from the random evolutions of the denizen Chaos 
Factor. 

&quot;You are evading the question, Ar&#39;kanis,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;Do you 
want my daughter or not?&quot; 

&quot;Mother!&quot; Sor&#39;en said in sharp protest. 

There was a creaking noise as he pushed off the wall and fully stood 
up, towering almost seven feet above the floor. He stepped closer to 
the light, the shadows falling away to reveal massive draconic wings 
that seemed to brush the ceiling. Attached to his belt was the 
scabbard of a broadsword that was almost as large as he was, the tip 
almost scraping the floor as he walked. 

&quot;It is not an issue of what I want or even what you want,&quot; he said 
very slowly and evenly. &quot;It is what Brigadier Sor&#39;en wants.&quot; 

&quot;I was just curious,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied, noticing the venomous glare 
she was getting from her daughter. &quot;And I do care about you, Sor&#39;en, 
which is why I make the effort to ensure you are not taken advantage 
of.&quot; 

Sor&#39;en muttered something acidic beneath her breath that didn&#39;t escape 
the vampire&#39;s sharp ears. She glanced up at her mother and blinked as 
she suddenly found herself on the receiving end of an icy stare. &quot;If 
there isn&#39;t anything else, Brigadier, you may return to your post,&quot; 
Nop&#39;tera said in a glacial tone. &quot;I want the flight deck checked and 
cleared before we make the final approach tomorrow.&quot; 

Sor&#39;en immediately straighted up at the sudden shift in her mother&#39;s 
mood. She knew she was allowed some leeway in private with her, but 
there were still some lines that even she dared not cross. &quot;It will be 
done before the end of the third watch, ma&#39;am,&quot; she said crisply. 

&quot;Dismissed.&quot; 

Ar&#39;kanis watched impassively as the young officer saluted, turned 
sharply on her heels, and quickly left the transport chamber. Everyone 
knew that she was an exceptionally bright young woman, having attained 
a very senior rank before her four-hundredth birthday based almost 
entirely on merit. The fact that she was the daughter of the division 
commander only very rarely came up in discussions about her leadership 
abilities, and when it did it was quickly brushed off as being mere 
coincidence. They had all seen Nop&#39;tera treat her just as equally and 
as fairly as any other officer under her command, including the rare 
rebuke or punishment when required. 

&quot;Her parents would have been proud,&quot; he rumbled softly. The only 
people who knew that Sor&#39;en was adopted instead of Nop&#39;tera&#39;s 
biological daughter were Nop&#39;tera, himself, and Freya. 

&quot;You&#39;re unusually vocal today,&quot; Nop&#39;tera replied. &quot;I&#39;m almost inclined 
to think that you are attracted to her.&quot; 

There was a hollow grunt from her second-in-command. &quot;Your daughter is 
undeniably beautiful,&quot; he said slowly, the slight echo-effect from his 
helmet making his tone seem cold and unfeeling. &quot;As is your personal 
minion,&quot; he added, watching Freya glance away, &quot;But I am not as 
interested as you would have others believe. I am satisifed with my 
duty and service to you as your loyal soldier.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera said nothing as she turned to look at Freya, having heard his 
speech several times before in various forms. She almost felt pity for 
him at times, but held back any such gestures out of respect for his 
wishes. She knew what it felt like to feel alone in the world, unable 
to emotionally reach out with only transient company for 
entertainment. At least, only up until Freya became a seemingly 
permanent part of her life. 

&quot;Are the troops prepared for tomorrow?&quot; she asked evenly with a silent 
sigh and gave in to an impulse to run her fingers through Freya&#39;s pale 
blue hair. 

&quot;They are looking forward to it,&quot; Ar&#39;kanis replied without hesitation. 
&quot;They see it as a chance to prove themselves to the rest of the 
military, as well as an opportunity to glorify your victory in the 
Hinterland Campaign.&quot; 

The Dark General shook her head. The campaign had lasted for close to 
three thousand years, a seemingly endless blur of bloody field 
combats, naval battles, aerial assaults, and three different battles 
in the depths of space that Nop&#39;tera would just as soon not have to 
fight again. I wonder if their fourth moon has finished imploding, she 
mused idly. That was a rather unique and spectacular research accident 
on their part.... 

&quot;A glorious victory,&quot; Nop&#39;tera said with a small trace of bitterness 
as she studied the delicate network of veins visible on Freya&#39;s neck 
and throat. &quot;A victory at what cost, General? How many thousands of 
denizens dead, and how many millions of Renn inhabitants?&quot; 

&quot;War is horrendous,&quot; he replied quietly. &quot;As well it should be, so 
that such a monumental event not be repeated lightly.&quot; 

She looked up sharply at the soft hissing noise, the unmistakable 
sound of a metallic blade being withdrawn from its protective 
scabbard. &quot;This blade knows the taste of blood,&quot; he said quietly as he 
held up his broadsword to the light. &quot;It is an acquired taste that 
only weapons have come to savor. Even one such as you who relishes in 
the flavor of fresh blood hesitates, even if only for a moment, to 
draw it forth unwillingly or without just cause. Such is the nature of 
war... to temper the brave, slake the thirst of the wicked, and force 
the righteous into examining their own souls.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera contemplated his words in silence as she studied the 
well-used weapon. When she had given it to him as a gift upon his 
promotion to full general so long ago, the blade had been the unique 
silvery-blue color of a rare ore found in an extinct volcano on the 
Renn homeworld. However, both time and the ravages of war had turned 
the blade a deep shade of sapphire blue, almost the same color of the 
mineral-rich blood that flowed in the veins of the race known as the 
Renn. 

&quot;You sound like you&#39;re questioning our purpose,&quot; she finally said to 
him. 

His helmet slowly shook back and forth. &quot;My purpose has been clear 
since I pledged my loyalty to you,&quot; he rumbled, the heavy sepulchral 
echo seeming to fill the room. &quot;It is your purpose that bothers you, 
and it is my job to see that it does not.&quot; 

She raised a snow-white eyebrow at him. &quot;Explain.&quot; 

&quot;You grow tired of war, yet feel you should not be,&quot; he said as he 
tilted his blood-stained blade to reflect the light. &quot;I know you 
better than anyone. Being war-weary is natural, Nop&#39;tera, more so that 
you of all of us have borne the heaviest burden through it all. My 
solders and I have always looked up to you, as we still do today. 
Tomorrow we will land at the Imperial Castle, join the rest of the 
Negaforce&#39;s military might, and celebrate the fruits of your 
leadership skills. We will rest then, as we have rarely rested during 
the war. And once you are rested, you will get bored, anxious to 
return to your soldiers and their ceaseless adoration of you. You lead 
them, and they will follow. That cycle is what sustains you, the 
give-and-take nature of command. It is what you know best, and what 
comforts you the most.&quot; 

Again she said nothing as she considered his words of wisdom, 
pondering their varied meanings as she had done countless times before 
when he saw it necessary to act as her council. She watched as he 
returned the broadsword to the scabbard on his belt and flexed his 
wings slowly. 

&quot;Consider this,&quot; he said quietly. &quot;You have your doubts about war. 
That is good, my general, for it means that you, unlike so many 
others, still retain your sense of morality and humanity.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera remained uncharacteristically silent as Ar&#39;kanis turned 
around and left the chamber, leaving her alone with Freya. It wasn&#39;t 
the first time that he had given her something to think about, but 
this time the thoughts were far more profound than usual. 

&quot;Tell me what&#39;s on your mind, Freya,&quot; she said to her slave. 

&quot;He&#39;s right,&quot; Freya replied softly. &quot;You were born to lead men and 
women into battle, and that you are sustained by their devotion and 
adoration.&quot; 

&quot;And what of my... humanity?&quot; 

The pale woman glanced away. &quot;I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be human 
anymore,&quot; she said sadly. 

Nop&#39;tera reached out and brushed her fingertips along her face. &quot;You 
were born a human,&quot; she reminded her gently. 

Freya finally turned to face her, pale violet eyes looking up and 
staring deep into featureless yellow eyes. &quot;My humanity was destroyed 
when I was torn kicking and screaming from my world,&quot; she whispered 
quietly. &quot;I was made a prisoner, abused, tortured, raped, robbed of 
everything except my life. Had I the chance, I would have gladly 
surrendered that as well. You came and rescued me, gave me your gift 
of eternal life. I was reborn, and whatever was left in me that was 
once human died on that night.&quot; 

&quot;Gift,&quot; the denizen vampire laughed quietly. &quot;Believe me when I say it 
was not anticipated that you would become cursed like me.&quot; 

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter,&quot; the human vampire replied quietly as she took her 
hand. &quot;I am yours, now and always. You are my only reason for 
existing, and it sustains me to know that my blood and service is what 
sustains you.&quot; 

&quot;Even as a slave?&quot; Nop&#39;tera asked, not for the first time. 

Freya glanced away. &quot;I exist for you now,&quot; she said, almost too softly 
to be heard. &quot;Nothing else matters anymore.&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera thought quietly as she gently squeezed her hand, feeling the 
warm pulse beneath her fingertips and wondering yet again what Freya 
truly thought of her situation. &quot;If you say so,&quot; she said quietly as 
she pulled her close, resting her slave&#39;s head on her shoulder and 
allowing herself to bask in the quiet comfort of her presence. She 
knew that if she had one fatal weakness, it was her feelings for her 
human slave. 

&quot;I have some of those reports ready that Sor&#39;en was able to retrieve,&quot; 
Freya said quietly after a minor eternity seemed to pass. &quot;You might 
want to read them soon as we don&#39;t have a lot of time left before your 
arrival.&quot; 

The general sighed quietly. &quot;Time has a habit of catching up to you, 
doesn&#39;t it? Very well,&quot; she said as she gently pushed away from her 
slave. &quot;I will be on the flight bridge if I&#39;m needed,&quot; she said, her 
voice changing to the even tone of command quite familar to everyone 
else. &quot;Inform the crew that there will be a formal command dinner this 
evening to discuss the plans for tomorrow&#39;s events.&quot; 

Freya bowed her head slightly. &quot;Is there anything in particular you 
want to see on the menu?&quot; 

Nop&#39;tera paused for a moment. &quot;See if you can find a decent vintage of 
wine, preferably an Asleen or a Tei-Nul-Ral,&quot; she suggested. &quot;We 
probably have a poor selection onboard, but I figure the Quartermaster 
won&#39;t care if we end up depleting her supply tonight. She can always 
restock what she wants after tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;An hour after the end of the second watch?&quot; Freya inquired. 

Nop&#39;tera nodded. &quot;Yes, best to give them time to shower and all.&quot; 

&quot;I will see to it,&quot; she promised. 

The Dark General gave her a small smile. &quot;You always do, Freya. I will 
be back in my quarters to change as soon as the second watch ends.&quot; 

&quot;Everything will be waiting,&quot; Freya replied with another slight bow of 
her head before she quietly left the room. 

Nop&#39;tera paused a moment to watch her leave, admiring as always the 
way her pale blue hair swayed as she walked. Even after a thousand 
years of her, I never cease to tire of her presence, she mused. What 
is it about humans that make them so fascinating? 

She shook her head to herself as she straightened her uniform with a 
tug on her jacket. Her face slipped into what some privately called 
her &quot;face of command&quot;, a seemingly stern mien that rarely failed to 
make others both wary and respectful of her imposing presence. Then 
with a quick brush of her hands through her snow-white hair, she left 
the transport chamber and headed up to the secondary command center on 
the airborne carrier&#39;s flight deck.

Alex and Michelle both stared at the television in awe, confusion, and 
amazement. &quot;This is something else,&quot; Alex said to Whisper without 
taking her eyes off of the screen. The local news broadcast was just 
ending and a quick blur of closing credits scrolled up. &quot;How long has 
this been around?&quot; 

Whisper chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure, to be honest, but I&#39;m 
guessing not for too many years. I take it mass-media wasn&#39;t invented 
in your era?&quot; 

Alex grunted quietly. &quot;The Moon Kingdom doesn&#39;t have anything like 
this, I know that much. Sue might have a better idea of things, 
however.&quot; 

&quot;Why do they keep having these interruptions?&quot; Michelle asked as she 
gave Whisper a questioning look. She was sitting on the far end of the 
couch, leaning against Alex and absently stroking the ball of gray fur 
in her lap. 

&quot;Commercials,&quot; the telepath replied as she leaned back in the chair. 
&quot;My understanding is that the network channels sell blocks of time to 
companies to advertise their products, and the revenue generated from 
that is how a lot of their income is made.&quot; 

Alex made a face. &quot;These things are so tacky,&quot; she complained as a 
cheap commercial for used cars was shown. &quot;Do people really have to 
suffer through all this nonsense every time they want to watch 
something?&quot; 

&quot;So it seems,&quot; Whisper replied with a faint grimace. &quot;We have 
mass-media in the Negaverse as well, but it&#39;s not even half as 
commercialized as this.&quot; 

The blonde shot her a dark glare at the mention of the Negaverse 
before returning her attention back to the television screen. Beside 
her, Michelle shivered lightly and leaned even more on her lover for 
comfort. 

&quot;These are some really stupid ads,&quot; Alex grumbled. &quot;Do people actually 
buy crap like that?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised,&quot; Whisper said dryly. 

Michelle blinked and straightened up as a commercial for a local mall 
was shown. &quot;Whisper, what&#39;s a mall?&quot; she inquired as she watched the 
images with rapt attention. 

The denizen telepath blinked hard. &quot;Umm... what exactly did you have 
as a shopping venue in the Moon Kingdom?&quot; she said carefully, trying 
to get a good idea of what they knew so as to have a fair idea of what 
she needed to explain. 

&quot;We have a large bazaar, plus a few small ones when merchants from 
Earth come to visit,&quot; Michelle replied. 

Whisper nodded. &quot;Okay. A mall is like a bazaar, except that everything 
is indoors and that each store has an assigned partition.&quot; 

&quot;A permanent bazaar?&quot; Alex said with a blink of confusion. &quot;That&#39;s 
odd.&quot; 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;Why? Your society is now heavily industrialized on 
a global scale, so it&#39;s only natural for commerce to expand at close 
to the same rate. For example, there are millions of people in this 
one city alone, so of course they need a massive base of commercial 
support.&quot; 

Michelle and Alex looked at one another for a few moments as they 
sought to comprehend the magnitude of the situation. &quot;What&#39;s the 
current planetary population?&quot; Michelle asked. 

&quot;Mine or yours?&quot; the denizen inquired. 

Michelle shot Alex a look as the blonde muttered something impolite 
under her breath that involved large rats. &quot;Earth, please,&quot; she said 
calmly as she squeezed Alex&#39;s leg. 

&quot;On the order of six billion, give or take a few,&quot; Whisper said 
casually. 

&quot;Holy crap, that&#39;s a lot of people,&quot; Alex said as her jaw sagged open. 
Michelle made a soft whimper of disbelief while Myst&#39;s ears perked up 
in quiet surprise. &quot;How&#39;d that happen?&quot; 

Whisper gave her a small grin. &quot;I think you know how it happened.&quot; 

Michelle giggled as Alex just rolled her eyes at the ceiling. &quot;Thank 
you, Chancellor Meiou, for that very insightful explanation,&quot; the 
blonde said dryly. 

&quot;Be nice,&quot; Michelle chided as she lightly smacked her leg. 

&quot;What is the population count of your world?&quot; Myst said, speaking up 
for the first time in the better part of an hour. 

&quot;Probably close to a billion,&quot; Whisper said after a moment of thought. 
&quot;Our planet is not as gifted with abundant natural resources as Earth 
is, so we&#39;re not able to support an overly massive population.&quot; 

Alex grunted as she leaned back against the cushions. &quot;I was wondering 
why you people invaded,&quot; she muttered darkly. Next to her, Michelle 
sighed quietly and curled up into a ball, resting her head on Alex&#39;s 
shoulder while slowly running her fingertips through Myst&#39;s silky gray 
fur. 

Whisper said nothing as she leaned forward to reach her cup of ma&#39;cha 
on the coffee table. she telepathed softly as she sipped on the 
denizen brew. 

&quot;Think I give a damn?&quot; Alex snapped. &quot;That battle was last week, as 
far as I can tell. Hell, I&#39;m surprised I still don&#39;t have six 
different colors of bloodstains beneath my fingernails,&quot; she growled 
as she reflexively looked at her hands. &quot;And that&#39;s just from what 
managed to soak through my gloves.&quot; 

&quot;Alex?&quot; Michelle whimpered plaintively as she clutched her arm. 

&quot;It might be a freakin&#39; thousand years to you,&quot; Alex continued, &quot;But 
you haven&#39;t basically been unconscious since then. No sense of time. 
No time to stop and mourn those good people we lost that day, friends 
I&#39;ll never see.... Friends and family....&quot; she said, her words coming 
slower with each moment and her tone starting to drop in pitch. 

&quot;Alex....&quot; Michelle whimpered again as she wrapped herself around 
Alex&#39;s arm and hugged her tight. 

&quot;They&#39;re all gone now,&quot; Alex said in a hollow tone as her gaze started 
to turn vacant. &quot;My mother, your parents, the Queen, the Ministers, 
the other Ladies and nobles.... the soldiers who were with us... all 
gone now....&quot; 

Whisper couldn&#39;t find any words of comfort to say or even telepath as 
she watched the tears start to well up in Alex&#39;s haunted blue eyes. 
Michelle was already sobbing quietly as she held onto her lover and 
the source of emotional support in her life, both now slipping into 
grief and despair over the loss of life from so long ago. 

She closed her eyes and extended her telepathic senses as far as she 
was able, trying to find the faint &quot;echo&quot; of Susan&#39;s mind so she could 
tell her of the situation. A small frown tugged on the corners of her 
lips as she realized that she wasn&#39;t anywhere in the cathedral, a 
less-than-comfortable realization of her having left without warning 
and leaving the other two humans alone. 

She looked back up at them and sighed, knowing they needed comfort 
right now. Michelle was wracked with sobs, her tears already visibly 
soaking the sleeve of Alex&#39;s shirt. Alex&#39;s breathing was unsteady but 
still silent, a look of anger and resentment on her face as she 
wrapped her arms around Michelle and gently rocked her back and forth. 
There were tears on her face as well, small droplets of grief and 
sadness trailing down across her cheeks. 

she telepathed to them after taking a deep breath. 

&quot;You&#39;re comparing a childhood accident to blatant genocide?&quot; Alex 
spat, her tone almost literally dripping with bitterness. 

she telepathed back, trying to suppress a shudder. 

&quot;Your point?&quot; 

was the flat mental reply. 

&quot;You people started it!&quot; Alex yelled, causing Michelle to whimper 
loudly. &quot;So what if it was finished with extreme prejudice? YOU 
DESERVED IT!!&quot; 

&quot;What did I ever do to you?&quot; Whisper said aloud. &quot;To hell with all 
that has happened long before I was even born, what have *I* done to 
deserve any of that pain and suffering? Nothing, Alex,&quot; she said as 
the blonde remained silent, her face still glistening with fallen 
tears. &quot;I do not deny in the slightest that your kingdom and you 
personally have been greatly wronged by my world, and if you decide to 
do something about it, I won&#39;t blame you one bit. 

&quot;But for the sake of all that you hold dear, for all the values that 
you uphold in your culture as sacred, make sure you take it out only 
on those few who are truly deserving of such retribution, not the 
common denizen peasant who tills his farm and only wishes to live his 
life in peace, not the young soldier who only seeks to serve her 
society as best she can. I know the pain in your soul right now is 
great, but how can you wish to inflict that same pain upon the 
genuinely innocent and still continue to call yourself righteous and 
just?&quot; 

Alex stared at her for a moment before looking away, the look of anger 
starting to fade from her eyes. Michelle&#39;s sobs were tapering off, 
becoming quieter with each passing moment as the words sank into her 
mind. 

&quot;Whatever,&quot; the blonde muttered softly, more to herself than anyone 
else. &quot;Try that crap again and next time we&#39;ll take your whole 
freaking planet off the known celestial map, your so-called innocents 
be damned.&quot; 

The denizen telepath thought it wise to say nothing further at that 
point, letting Alex express the anger and frustrations she was 
experiencing. Beside her, Michelle had fallen silent save for the odd 
sniffle, her head still buried in the crook of Alex&#39;s shoulder and 
clutching Myst in a death-grip. 

A faint chiming sound echoed down from the hallway and Michelle bolted 
upright, her aquamarine eyes wide with something between fear and 
terror. Alex immediately reached over and clamped her hand over 
Michelle&#39;s mouth before she could scream. 

&quot;Love, don&#39;t do it,&quot; she cautioned as the chiming sound grew closer. 
&quot;I know you don&#39;t like spiders, but I don&#39;t want my eardrums to 
rupture because you&#39;re screaming four inches away from me.&quot; 

Michelle made a muffled but very high-pitched whimpering noise as 
Dyvach skittered into view, holding a small box of tissues. It paused 
for a moment before very slowly walking over to Alex, holding out the 
box in front of it and chiming quietly. 

&quot;Umm.... ahh.... t-thank you,&quot; Alex said hesitantly to the weaver as 
she reached out with her free hand to take the box of tissues. 
Dyvach&#39;s crystal carapace turned a bright pink color as it cooed 
quietly in response, waving a leg at her before quickly skittering 
back down the residential hallway. 

The blonde gave the tissues a dubious look. &quot;That&#39;s scary,&quot; she said 
to the room in general as she fished a pair of tissues out of the box 
and passed it to Michelle. &quot;They look normal to me, hon,&quot; she said as 
Michelle whimpered quietly. &quot;Just take a few and degunk your nose 
before it ends up on my shirt, if you please.&quot; 

Michelle gave her a slightly insulted look before she grabbed a large 
wad of tissues and started drying her eyes, still sniffling quietly. 

&quot;Do you feel better?&quot; Whisper asked gently. 

&quot;Hell no,&quot; Alex replied as she wiped the remains of her tears away. 

&quot;Yes, we do,&quot; Michelle said softly as she leaned back against Alex. 

&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; the blonde muttered. 

&quot;You humans have got to be the strangest creatures I&#39;ve ever met,&quot; 
Myst said sourly as she wriggled out of Michelle&#39;s lap and jumped down 
to the floor. 

Alex cast an irritated glance at the kitten. &quot;Who asked you?&quot; 

The Shinma ignored her as she examined the patch of wet fur on her 
tail. &quot;Why are your eyes leaking?&quot; 

&quot;Biology is a bitch,&quot; Alex grumped. &quot;You&#39;re better off asking Susan to 
explain crap like tears when she gets back.&quot; 

Whisper gave her a curious look. &quot;Do you know where she is right now? 
I can&#39;t sense her anywhere in the cathedral.&quot; 

&quot;Who knows,&quot; the blonde said as she rubbed Michelle&#39;s back gently. 
&quot;She rarely tells us anything about her time-travel stunts. She said 
she&#39;d be back in time for lunch, then blipped out like she usually 
does.&quot; 

Whisper glanced at the clock on the wall outside the kitchen. &quot;Well, 
it&#39;s almost time for lunch now, so....&quot; 

Almost as if on cue, there was a flash of temporal energy as Susan 
went sprawling onto the floor. Everyone gasped in shock as they 
suddenly realized that something was gravely wrong with the succubus. 

&quot;Sue, what the hell happened?&quot; Alex yelled as she darted forward, the 
color draining from her features at the sight of Susan&#39;s face and 
skin. 

&quot;I&#39;ll recover,&quot; Susan rasped weakly as she tried to wipe the blood out 
of her eyes. Her dark red blood was oozing from her nose, eyes, and 
ears, and a harsh rasp was evident in her breathing. Her skin was 
severely blotched with vicious purple bruises and her eyes were so 
bloodshot as to almost appear to be a uniform red. Her wings were 
hanging limply from her back, the dark surface seemingly blistered 
with red splotches. 

&quot;Bullcrap, what happened?&quot; Alex demanded, her eyes wide and wondering 
if things were truly as bad as they looked. 

&quot;Vacuum exposure?&quot; Whisper said quickly as she darted up from her 
chair, suddenly remembering seeing someone else in that condition a 
long time ago. 

Susan nodded in her general direction, essentially blinded by the 
blood in her eyes. &quot;Precisely. I&#39;ll be able to recover,&quot; she added 
with a grimace. 

&quot;Let me see what we have for that,&quot; the telepath said as she ran down 
the hall to the supply closet. 

&quot;Susan, what happened?&quot; Michelle whimpered, horrified to see the 
extensive damage to Susan&#39;s body. 

&quot;I... went back in time to the Kingdom,&quot; Susan rasped as she sat up. 
&quot;I returned after the Shield collapsed and... supposedly regenerated 
itself, but it seems that it was... highly unstable for a period of 
time and kept... collapsing. I got caught by surprise and... the 
atmosphere vented before I could relocate. Do... Do you have anything 
I could use to clean my eyes?&quot; 

&quot;Gimme that,&quot; Alex said to Michelle as she pointed to the forgotten 
box of tissues sitting on the edge of the couch. The box was promptly 
picked up and tossed across the room to the blonde, who just as 
quickly put it in Susan&#39;s hands. &quot;Here, a box of tissues. Courtesy of 
that giant spider,&quot; she added. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Susan said gratefully as she started to wipe the blood 
from her eyes and nose. She coughed several times before being able to 
draw in a deep breath for a sigh. &quot;That was... decidedly unpleasant.&quot; 

Alex just shook her head. &quot;Sue, you look like you&#39;ve just been beaten 
to within an inch of your life,&quot; she said sadly. 

Much to her surprise, the succubus chuckled quietly. &quot;It just looks 
bad, Alex. The purple discoloration is caused by ruptured capillaries 
in the skin. It&#39;s minor cosmetic damage that will heal itself in about 
an hour.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re dripping blood on the floor, and you call that minor?&quot; 

Just then, Whisper came back into the room holding a small bottle. 
&quot;Here, this should help,&quot; she said as she held it out to Susan. 

Susan blinked several times before sighing. &quot;I can&#39;t really see much 
of anything right now,&quot; she admitted. 

The telepath blinked hard as she knelt next to her. &quot;I hope you don&#39;t 
have retinal damage,&quot; she said in a worried tone as she opened the 
bottle. &quot;Tilt your head back. These eyedrops should help reduce 
swelling, but they might sting a bit at first,&quot; she cautioned. 

&quot;I probably wouldn&#39;t notice if they did,&quot; Susan replied as she 
complied with Whisper&#39;s instructions. &quot;And I&#39;m not worried about 
retinal damage, as I should be finished healing before dinner.&quot; 

&quot;Regeneration must be nice,&quot; Whisper said as she carefully put three 
drops of the solution in each bloodstained eye. &quot;Low-level or 
high-level?&quot; 

The succubus grunted as the drops stung worse than she had 
anticipated. &quot;Technically both, but my rate of high-level regeneration 
is often described as ponderously slow by other succubi.&quot; 

Alex just sighed and sat back on her heels. &quot;Sue, you&#39;re a real piece 
of work, you know? You look like crap, you have purple marks the size 
of grapes all over your entire body, your wings look like they&#39;ve been 
grilled over an open flame, you have blood dripping from your tear 
ducts of all places, and here you are having a casual conversation 
with someone who is busy trying to put drops in your eyes to salvage 
your vision.&quot; 

Susan smiled despite the pain she was in. &quot;I&#39;ve been injured worse,&quot; 
she said. &quot;As I said, most of this damage is purely cosmetic.&quot; 

&quot;How are your lungs?&quot; Whisper asked as she capped the bottle. &quot;I know 
what even a brief exposure to a total vacuum can do to a person.&quot; 

Susan took a deep breath and winced at the tightness in her chest. &quot;I 
think they&#39;re still functional for the most part,&quot; she replied. &quot;It 
took a few seconds for the atmosphere to vent completely, and I think 
I was able to shift away before then. Since I can still breathe, the 
damage obviously isn&#39;t very severe and will be fully healed in a few 
hours,&quot; she added as she wiped the drops from her eyes with a tissue. 

Whisper just shook her head as she sat back to study Susan&#39;s wings. &quot;I 
saw the scars last night, but I didn&#39;t know they were from wings.&quot; 

The succubus winced as she tried flexing her wings. &quot;I had planned to 
explain it to everyone tonight after dinner had settled. Hopefully the 
worst of the bruising will have healed before then.&quot; 

Alex looked at Susan&#39;s minimal attire. &quot;I hope you&#39;re not going to 
come to dinner dressed like that,&quot; she commented. &quot;Or nearly 
undressed, as the case might be. You actually comfortable wearing just 
a ribbon like that?&quot; 

Susan rolled her eyes and immediately regretted it. &quot;Of course I plan 
on changing into a more formal dress,&quot; she replied. &quot;I haven&#39;t had 
time to change since my meeting with Lord Hades in the Underworld.&quot; 

Myst&#39;s ears perked up at the mention of the ruler of the Underworld. 
&quot;You met with Hades?&quot; she said incrediously. The Shinma was curled up 
beneath the coffee table in a spot that was well away from edgy humans 
but still let her observe everything going on around her. 

&quot;Yes, and a rather interesting meeting it turned out to be,&quot; Susan 
said as she set the box of tissues on the floor and tried to stand up. 
Her joints throbbed in agonizing protest as she slowly drew herself to 
her feet. 

&quot;Hey, whoa, easy,&quot; Alex protested, grabbing Susan&#39;s arm as her balance 
visibly wavered. 

&quot;Alex, that hurts....&quot; Susan gasped as the nerves in her arm seemed to 
explode in pain. 

The blonde immediately let go and stepped close to the succubus, 
letting her lean on her shoulder under her own power. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she 
apologized. 

&quot;Are you sure you&#39;re going to be alright?&quot; Michelle asked cautiously 
from the couch, her aquamarine eyes still wide with shock and 
bloodshot from her crying fit earlier. 

Susan nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve had far better days, but I will be fine.&quot; She 
paused as she noticed Michelle&#39;s eyes and cast a glance at Alex. 
&quot;Perhaps I should be asking you two if you are alright. Have you been 
crying?&quot; 

Alex snorted. &quot;Me, cry? You have to be kidding.&quot; 

There was a soft sigh. &quot;Alexis Ten&#39;ou, what happened?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, stuff it, Sue,&quot; the blonde growled. &quot;You know I hate it when you 
call me that.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;re evading the question.&quot; 

&quot;And?&quot; 

Susan sighed again and turned to Michelle. &quot;What happened?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t get her started again,&quot; Alex interrupted as Michelle started to 
sniffle again. She carefully pulled away from Susan and crossed the 
room to sit down next to her lover, wrapping her arms around her in a 
comforting hug. 

Whisper privately telepathed to Susan. 

Susan made a noise in her throat that could have either been a grunt 
of pain or a subvocal acknowldgement. She wasn&#39;t sure she had fully 
come to terms with events herself, but she had already let her own 
tears fall in the privacy of her keep days ago. She waited until 
Michelle had calmed back down before she spoke up. 

&quot;The reason I returned to the Kingdom in the past was so I could 
retrieve this,&quot; she said as she pulled an ornate mirror out of her 
Lunar Space pocket. 

Michelle blinked hard and her face immediately lit up. &quot;My mirror!&quot; 
she exclaimed as she leapt to her feet, almost knocking Alex over in 
the process. 

&quot;Hey, watch it, Mich!&quot; Alex complained as she rubbed her elbow. 

&quot;It needs some work, though,&quot; Susan cautioned as she handed over the 
Soul Mirror. The body was a bright aquamarine color, inlaid with 
silver filigree, with several precious stones spaced around the 
circular mirror. The sign of Neptune was inlaid in gold on the back, 
partially obscured by the thick layer of dust and dried blood coating 
the upper half of the mirror. 

&quot;It&#39;s broken,&quot; Michelle said plaintively as her mood just as quickly 
went back to a near-depressive state. The normally polished surface of 
the mirror was thoroughly shattered and several large pieces were 
missing, giving the mirror a dark and hideous look. 

&quot;The true power of the mirror lies within, Michelle, not merely in the 
glass itself,&quot; Susan explained gently as Michelle&#39;s expression became 
downcast. &quot;Believe me, I&#39;ve had to have the glass reforged countless 
times over the span of seven centuries.&quot; 

&quot;Screw the glass,&quot; Alex said with a distasteful look on her face, &quot;You 
better soak that bad boy in some serious disinfectant. How much blood 
is on that thing, anyway?&quot; 

&quot;Eww....&quot; Michelle whimpered as she suddenly realized what the dark 
red coloring was beneath the dirt. A particularly dark thought 
occurred to her as she gave Susan an uncertain look. &quot;Is this... my 
blood?&quot; she asked hesitantly. 

Susan shrugged. &quot;I have no idea, to be honest, but if I had to take an 
educated guess, I&#39;d say that&#39;s a distinct possibility.&quot; 

&quot;Eww....&quot; she repeated, looking like she was ready to drop the mirror. 

&quot;I would have taken it directly to one of the attendants of the 
Hellforge in the Underworld, but I had more pressing matters on my 
mind at the time,&quot; Susan said with a shrug of apology. 

&quot;Hellforge?&quot; Alex asked warily. &quot;That doesn&#39;t sound good.&quot; 

The succubus raised a delicate green eyebrow. &quot;Where do you think your 
Soul Saber was forged?&quot; 

&quot;In Hellfire? Aww, don&#39;t tell me that....&quot; Alex said with a faint look 
of unease as Susan nodded her head. &quot;Hey, speaking of which....&quot; 

Susan sighed quietly as she flexed her wings slowly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Alex, 
but I couldn&#39;t find it. It&#39;s possible it was destroyed in the 
explosion.&quot; 

The blonde flopped back against the couch cushions. &quot;Man, that bites 
the big one,&quot; she said sourly. &quot;I really, really liked that saber.&quot; 

&quot;I take it you know how to use a sword?&quot; Whisper inquired cautiously. 

&quot;With an arm like this?&quot; Alex replied as she rolled her right sleeve 
up and flexed the muscles in her arm and shoulder. &quot;Trust me, I&#39;m 
quite good at turning an opponent into a fillet.&quot; 

Michelle glanced over at her and sighed quietly before returning her 
gaze to the shattered mirror. &quot;You sure this is easy to fix?&quot; she 
asked quietly. 

&quot;Decidedly easy,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;I will take it to the Hellforge 
early tomorrow morning to have the glass reforged, and it should be as 
good as new by lunchtime.&quot; 

&quot;Assuming they can get all the blood off first,&quot; Alex commented with a 
shake of her head. &quot;That looks kinda messy.&quot; 

Michelle whimpered softly to herself at the thought of the mirror 
having been dropped in a pool of her own blood after the fatal 
explosion. Susan took note of the expression on her face and just 
shook her head slowly. I still don&#39;t see how they could possibly have 
ended up together as lovers, she mused to herself. 

There was a soft creaking noise from across the room as the door to 
the staircase opened up. Everyone turned to look as Tolaris and Maze 
entered the living room, neither one wearing much more than pants. 
Tolaris&#39;s body had turned a noticable shade of pink and he was using 
Maze&#39;s towel to wipe a sheen of strange blue fluid off of his skin. 

&quot;Cheer up,&quot; Maze was saying, &quot;That could have gone a lot worse.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, it could have taken off three layers of skin instead of two,&quot; 
the other Dragoon shot back. 

&quot;Hey, you&#39;re the one who took the dose of radiation, so you know 
the.... AY&#39;CHA NAVIDSHI, what happened?!&quot; Maze exclaimed suddenly as 
he saw Susan. 

Susan sighed and gently blew her nose. &quot;I had the unfortunate 
experience of being suspended in a total vacuum for a brief moment,&quot; 
she said, making a face at the amount of blood that ended up in the 
tissue. 

&quot;Are you going to be okay?&quot; Tolaris asked with a concerned expression. 

&quot;Sue&#39;s a tough bitch,&quot; Alex said dryly as she him and Maze very 
appraising looks. &quot;We think she&#39;ll be okay once she quits bleeding.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Alex,&quot; Susan said with a patient sigh. 

Maze blinked hard. &quot;What&#39;s with the wings? I thought humans didn&#39;t 
have those....&quot; he said cautiously. 

&quot;I&#39;m only half-human,&quot; Susan said with another sigh. &quot;The other half 
is a winged species of demon known as a succubus.&quot; 

&quot;Sounds like fun,&quot; Maze commented. &quot;And what are you looking at?&quot; 

&quot;You look like you&#39;ve seen better days,&quot; Alex replied casually as she 
started counting the scars she could see from halfway across the room. 
&quot;What&#39;s with the big scar on your shoulder?&quot; 

The purple-haired Dragoon cast a reflexive look at his shoulder. 
&quot;Which one? I have several. Pales in comparison to what Tolaris has, 
however,&quot; he added with a jerk of his thumb at Tolaris&#39;s exposed 
abdomen. 

&quot;Leave me alone,&quot; Tolaris muttered. 

&quot;Holy crap,&quot; Alex said as she blinked at the area of skin that had 
been burned away and regenerated a long time ago. &quot;What happened 
there?&quot; 

&quot;A plasma strike at very close range,&quot; Tolaris replied as he moved 
past the couch towards the residential wing. &quot;Very painful, I assure 
you. Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to finish getting this 
anti-radiation acid off of my skin before it eats through another 
layer.&quot; 

&quot;Yeech,&quot; Alex said with a sour expression. 

A sudden idea flashed into Whisper&#39;s mind with the force of a 
supernova. &quot;One second, Commander,&quot; she said quickly as she grabbed 
his arm. &quot;Turn around for a moment. Here, see this scar, Alex?&quot; she 
asked as she ran her fingertip along a particular scar on Tolaris&#39; 
arm. &quot;That was caused by crystal shards from a fragmentation grenade. 
That same grenade gave me a rather unsightly scar on my back, left a 
sizable scar on Maze&#39;s leg, and nearly killed Ra&#39;vel.&quot; 

Alex gave the telepath a slightly confused look. &quot;Okay, and...?&quot; 

&quot;We got those scars while helping to protect Sailor Moon and the 
others when they were in the Negaverse awhile ago,&quot; Whisper said 
evenly. She had to suppress the urge to smile as Alex blinked hard at 
the concept of denizens trying to protect the Moon Princess. Just as I 
figured you would, she thought to herself. Now let&#39;s see if that 
breaks the ice a tiny bit more.... 

&quot;You were protecting the Princess?&quot; a voice asked. Whisper was mildly 
surprised to hear Michelle&#39;s voice instead of Alex asking the expected 
question for confirmation. 

&quot;Not everyone has a grudge against Sailor Moon,&quot; Tolaris replied. 
&quot;Some of us believe in being responsible hosts and trying to take care 
of our guests, even if they are from another world. I don&#39;t mean to be 
rude, but this acid is really beginning to burn.&quot; 

Whisper shook her head as she released his arm. &quot;Go on, I should have 
lunch ready by the time you&#39;re finished scrubbing.&quot; 

&quot;Acid?&quot; Susan inquired mildly as she watched Tolaris make a rapid 
exit. 

&quot;Decontamination protocol,&quot; Maze explained. &quot;Anytime we&#39;re exposed to 
radiation that registers inside the hardsuits, we&#39;re required to 
undergo a full chemical scrubbing procedure. It usually only takes off 
the top layer of skin, but it&#39;s a small price to pay to avoid any 
possible problems down the line.&quot; 

&quot;Ouch,&quot; Alex said with a sympathetic wince. 

&quot;Ouch indeed,&quot; Whisper said, looking at her hand as it started to 
tingle from exposure to the acid. &quot;I trust the reactor is working fine 
now?&quot; 

Maze chuckled for a brief moment. &quot;You&#39;d know if it wasn&#39;t. Susan, are 
you quite sure you&#39;re fine? I don&#39;t mean any disrespect, but you 
really look like you could use a visit from a Healer.&quot; 

Susan stretched her arms out in front of her to examine her blotched 
skin. &quot;I&#39;m already healing,&quot; she replied patiently. &quot;It will just take 
an hour or two for my regenerative abilities to repair all the 
capillaries and drain the blood clots. It really is not as bad as it 
looks,&quot; she added. 

Maze grunted quietly. &quot;If you say so,&quot; he muttered as he looked up and 
down at Susan&#39;s minimal attire. &quot;I must say, I like your tailor. I&#39;ve 
seen many styles of clothing designed to compliments a woman&#39;s figure 
before, but that seems to be the most inventive one I&#39;ve encountered 
in centuries.&quot; 

A soft smile tugged on Susan&#39;s lips. &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;Lieutenant, go get dressed before I consider telling Mina about 
that,&quot; Whisper suggested as she walked into the kitchen and promptly 
rinsed her hand off in the sink. &quot;We&#39;re having soup and salad for 
lunch, plus a selection of sandwiches if I can find what I did with 
the package of deli meat.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; the Dragoon muttered as he cast one final glance of 
wonder at Susan&#39;s wings before walking down the hallway towards the 
bedroom he shared with Mina. 

Alex frowned slightly. &quot;What&#39;s Mina have to do with this?&quot; 

There was a slight pause in the activity in the kitchen. &quot;No one told 
you that Mina and Maze were dating?&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; both Alex and Michelle said in unison as their jaws sagged 
open. 

&quot;I hadn&#39;t gotten around to telling them that,&quot; Susan explained. &quot;I had 
figured it was a minor detail that could wait until everyone was 
here.&quot; 

Alex just sighed heavily. &quot;Sue, what else do you know?&quot; 

Susan started flexing her wings slowly, trying to restore circulation 
to the damaged capillaries. &quot;Ami and Tolaris are dating as well.&quot; 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Alex said slowly. &quot;So what you&#39;re telling me is that we have 
two different Sailor Scouts dating people from the Negaverse?&quot; 

&quot;Three, actually,&quot; Susan replied. &quot;It&#39;s my understanding that Leda 
also has a romantic interest who isn&#39;t human, but I don&#39;t have that 
one entirely sorted out yet.&quot; 

&quot;Great, that&#39;s just freakin&#39; great....&quot; 

Michelle moved over to Alex and took her hand gently. &quot;Is that really 
a bad thing?&quot; she asked Susan quietly as she rested her head on the 
blonde&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I mean, isn&#39;t it good that they have someone to 
care about?&quot; 

The succubus shrugged, then winced as a joint in her shoulder popped. 
&quot;I have yet to determine that, but from what I&#39;ve seen it appears to 
be a quite serious affair. No pun intended,&quot; she added. 

Alex shivered. &quot;Now there&#39;s an image I didn&#39;t need. Can you imagine 
one of them in bed with someone from the Negaverse?&quot; 

Whisper poked her head out of the kitchen with a small frown. &quot;Excuse 
me, but can you please stop saying that like it&#39;s a bad thing to be 
from a world other than Earth?&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not far from the truth, but I&#39;ll still consider it,&quot; Alex in a 
tone laced with acid, ignoring the warning prod in the back from 
Michelle. 

Susan gave the blonde a rather smug smile. &quot;Actually, Alex, it doesn&#39;t 
have to be imagined at all,&quot; she said lightly. 

There was a long pause as the meaning of her words sank into Alex&#39;s 
mind. &quot;Sue? I really didn&#39;t need to know that,&quot; she said sourly as 
Michelle nodded in agreement. &quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, Ami and Mina are 
wonderful friends, I love them both, but I don&#39;t need to be told about 
what they do with whom once the sun sets.&quot; 

&quot;Neither do the rest of us,&quot; Whisper muttered. She looked up and 
caught Susan&#39;s questioning look. &quot;Tolaris is still working on keeping 
a lid on his powers when.... distracted,&quot; she explained with a faint 
blush. &quot;He&#39;s gotten better at it, but we still tend to get an awful 
lot of rainfall around here.&quot; 

&quot;Ah, I see,&quot; Susan replied as her eyebrows arched up to her hairline. 

&quot;I don&#39;t,&quot; Alex grumbled. &quot;What&#39;s the rain have to do with Tolaris?&quot; 

&quot;Commander Tolaris can control the weather,&quot; Whisper explained as she 
turned her telekinetic powers loose on various culinary items and 
implements. &quot;To make a long story short, we have frequent storms in 
the area.&quot; 

Alex and Michelle looked at one another for several seconds. &quot;I 
remember you talking yesterday about denizen powers and chaos,&quot; 
Michelle said. &quot;Is that what you meant?&quot; 

The telepath nodded. &quot;Yes. Tolaris can control the weather in addition 
to a few minor things, Maze can project an energy shield and has some 
type of kinetic energy dart attack, I can assume a quasi-dimensional 
form as well as having psionics, and Ra&#39;vel has both psionics and a 
high-energy sonic attack.&quot; 

&quot;So everyone&#39;s powers are all different?&quot; Michelle asked. 

&quot;Usually,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;It&#39;s called the Chaos Factor for several 
reasons, one of them being because it is so unpredictable.&quot; 

&quot;Lovely,&quot; Alex muttered. &quot;That explains most of the problems we ran 
into during the battle. Sue, you remember that one chick with the fire 
beast?&quot; 

Susan shook her head. &quot;Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t dwell so much on the 
past,&quot; she suggested gently. &quot;I assure you that, while I have not and 
probably never will forget, I have no particular desire to keep those 
memories fresh in my mind.&quot; 

The blonde grunted quietly as she felt Michelle&#39;s hand wrapping around 
her waist. &quot;Hey, Mich? Watch where you put that thing,&quot; she said with 
a gesture to the broken Soul Mirror in Michelle&#39;s other hand. &quot;Blood 
stains are a bitch-kitty to get out of fabric, and these were just 
washed.&quot; 

Michelle gave her a dour look as she moved to set the mirror down on 
the coffee table. She froze in mid-motion as she heard a clattering 
noise followed by the echo of chimes coming down the hall. 

&quot;Oh, not this one again,&quot; Alex sighed as she tightly squeezed 
Michelle&#39;s hand. &quot;Just relax, hon. Breathe deep, chill out, he won&#39;t 
bother you.&quot; 

Michelle just whimpered quietly as Dyvach wandered into the living 
room, chiming softly to itself. Susan rasied a questioning eyebrow at 
the weaver, having dealt with it several times in the past but still 
not fully able to make sense of the musical tones of the weaver 
language. 

Whisper frowned as she stuck her head out of the kitchen, still using 
her telekinetic powers to prepare lunch. &quot;Yes, Dyvach, what is it?&quot; 
She blinked hard as the oversized crystal spider made a very 
complicated series of chimes, its carapace turning a dark purple 
color. &quot;You want to eat what?&quot; 

Dyvach made a sound very much akin to hailstones falling onto a broken 
xylophone as it pointed to the ruined mirror in Michelle&#39;s hand. It 
continued to chime quietly at the telepath before folding half of its 
many legs and did the weaver equivalent of sitting cross-legged on the 
floor. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think I like the sound of this one,&quot; Alex said warily. 

&quot;I think it said it wants to try fixing the mirror,&quot; Whisper replied 
with an uncertain look. &quot;That meant repair and not deconstruct, 
right?&quot; 

Susan blinked as Dyvach chimed an affirmative. &quot;You want to repair the 
mirror?&quot; she asked slowly. 

&quot;Whoa, wait, time out,&quot; Alex said as she felt Michelle&#39;s grip tighten. 
&quot;Someone want to run this one past me again?&quot; 

Whisper set everything down on the counter before focusing her full 
span of attention on the situation. &quot;Weavers have the innate ability 
to eat almost any object, analyze the molecular content and structure, 
and reconstitute a duplicate item from sufficient raw materials,&quot; she 
explained. &quot;Tolaris tells me that Dyvach is better than most weavers 
due to its high intelligence.&quot; 

Susan gave the weaver an odd look as it made a dour chiming noise. &quot;I 
know you are a sentient being, Dyvach, but do you really know what 
exactly the Soul Mirror is?&quot; 

&quot;Important artifact,&quot; Whisper translated as Dyvach made very slow and 
distinct chimes. &quot;Glass unimportant, not damage anything, clean up. 
Eat glass, analyze, reconstitute.&quot; 

Susan mentally shrugged. &quot;It&#39;s up to you, Michelle, it&#39;s your mirror,&quot; 
she said. &quot;If it doesn&#39;t work the way Dyvach had in mind, I can still 
take it back to the Hellforge to have it reworked.&quot; 

&quot;Let me get this right,&quot; Alex said slowly as Michelle whimpered again. 
&quot;You want Mich here to let a giant spider try to fix the mirror?&quot; 

The succubus nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t see any harm as long as only the glass 
is worked on. And either way, it still needs cleaning.&quot; 

&quot;Dyvach is harmless, I assure you,&quot; Whisper said consolingly as the 
weaver flushed a medium blue color. 

Alex blew her breath out and looked at her lover. &quot;This is crazy, 
hon.&quot; 

Michelle gave Alex an uncertain look before turning her attention back 
to Dyvach. Her mouth opened and closed silently several times as she 
tried to find something to say. She finally settled for whimpering 
quietly as she held the mirror out to the weaver, her hand visibly 
shaking. 

Dyvach cooed softly at her as it took the mirror in four legs and 
gently brought it down to what passed for eye-level. It examined the 
surface of the mirror for several seconds before it ripped a shard of 
glass out and promptly ate it. 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Alex exclaimed in protest at the horrid crunching sound. &quot;Watch 
it, you&#39;re gonna leave shards everywhere!&quot; 

Whisper shrugged and turned her attention back to making lunch. &quot;It 
told you it had to analyze the glass first,&quot; she chided gently. &quot;And 
Dyvach is very good about not leaving a mess behind.&quot; 

Michelle and Alex just stared at the weaver as it ripped off another 
shard of glass and ate it, the crunching noise raising the hair on 
their arms. It then paused for a few moments before making a decidedly 
pleasant series of soft chimes as its carapace turned a dusky rose 
color. 

&quot;I give up,&quot; Alex said quietly. &quot;I know I&#39;ve only been around for 
about seventeen years and have seen only a fraction of the strangeness 
this universe has to offer, but watching a giant spider eat glass has 
got to be on the top of the list. What do you think, Sue?&quot; 

Susan tilted her head as the studied the weaver, listening more to the 
musical chimes than Alex. &quot;I think that color would make a perfect 
shade of nail polish,&quot; she said absently. 

Alex gave her a startled look before glancing back at Dyvach&#39;s crystal 
carapace. &quot;You think of the damnedest things,&quot; she muttered. &quot;And the 
truly scary part is, you&#39;re probably right.&quot; 

Michelle barely heard the exchange, listening with rapt attention to 
the sequence of chimes. She thought she could hear a sort of pattern 
to the way the notes were arranged, something only a musician would 
casually be able to notice. &quot;Is that music.... mathematical?&quot; she 
asked hesitantly. 

&quot;What?&quot; Alex asked in confusion. 

Susan blinked. &quot;I take it you hear something unusual?&quot; she inquired. 

&quot;You can&#39;t hear that?&quot; Michelle replied with a look of confusion on 
her delicate features. 

&quot;Hear what?&quot; Alex grumbled. 

Susan said nothing as she studied the weaver, still curled up and 
chiming quietly to itself. She herself was quite skilled in music, 
having learned to play the cello over the course of a century, but 
knew that whatever skills she had acquired paled in comparison to 
Michelle&#39;s innate skill with the violin. It was no surprise to her 
that Michelle would also have a superior &quot;musician&#39;s ear&quot; for picking 
up patterns in music. 

Dyvach fell silent for a moment before chittering something at 
Michelle, its carapace darkening to a purple hue. &quot;It&#39;s the chemical 
composition of the glass in musical form,&quot; Whisper said from the 
kitchen as she shredded a head of lettuce. &quot;I guess you could call it 
a form of mathematics.&quot; 

&quot;That was beautiful,&quot; Michelle said, giving the weaver a cautious 
look. &quot;Is that a composition or a direct translation?&quot; 

&quot;Translation,&quot; Whisper said after Dyvach made a single multi-harmonic 
chime in response. It then launched into a brief explanation that 
sounded to everyone like a set of wind-chimes caught in a really bad 
gale. &quot;I didn&#39;t understand a word of that,&quot; Whisper said with a sigh. 

Dyvach made a flat chime of frustration that needed little 
translation. It flipped the mirror over and started to clean the dirt 
and blood off, doing so in a manner that wasn&#39;t immediately obvious to 
the others in the room. 

&quot;Oh, for the love of Xavier Pendragon,&quot; Alex groaned after a moment of 
cautious observation. &quot;Susan, please tell me he&#39;s not licking it 
off....&quot; 

&quot;Ewwwwwwww,&quot; Michelle whimpered as she turned around, her skin visibly 
crawling with revulsion. 

Whisper wrinkled her nose in disgust. &quot;Must you do that?&quot; Dyvach 
replied with an unusually happy chime and gave a lenthy reply. 
&quot;Dyvach, you really need to learn about the concept of too much 
information,&quot; she sighed. 

Susan tilted her head slightly. &quot;That was about the quality of the 
blood, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked carefully. 

The denizen blinked hard and gave her a measured look. &quot;Yes, that was 
it exactly,&quot; she said slowly. &quot;Should I ask how you knew that?&quot; 

&quot;An educated guess,&quot; Susan said calmly. &quot;Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;I would 
imagine that the blood molecules contain a high degree of iron which 
would be useful in certain chemical reactions.&quot; 

&quot;Funny someone should bring up the subject of too much information,&quot; 
Alex grumbled quietly as she wrapped her arms around Michelle&#39;s 
shuddering form. 

&quot;There&#39;s no such thing as too much information,&quot; Maze&#39;s voice said as 
he walked down the hallway, now fully dressed. &quot;There might be 
information you really don&#39;t want to hear, but too much information is 
always preferable to not enough. Dyvach, what are you eating this 
time?&quot; 

Whisper shook her head and ducked back into the kitchen. &quot;Trust me, 
Maze, some questions are better left unanswered.&quot; 

Susan stepped to one side and tried flexing her wings again. &quot;Dyvach 
is attemping to clean and repair Michelle&#39;s hand mirror,&quot; she 
explained. 

The Dragoon laughed quietly. &quot;Child&#39;s play for it,&quot; he said with a 
grin. &quot;You should have been here when we were building a laser array. 
Now that was a real challenge.&quot; 

&quot;What&#39;s a laser?&quot; Alex asked with a frown. 

&quot;A focused beam of coherent light on a specific wavelength,&quot; Susan 
said with a glance of annoyance. &quot;You&#39;ve seen the Screen control 
chamber before, Alex. The glowing beams of light between the crystal 
elements were lasers.&quot; 

&quot;Ohh, those things,&quot; the blonde said as the proverbial lightbulb lit 
up. 

Maze paused as he looked up and down at Susan&#39;s body. &quot;Is is me or are 
those bruises fading already?&quot; 

Susan looked at her arms and nodded. &quot;I keep telling everyone that I 
would be finished healing in a few hours,&quot; she said patiently. She 
flinched along with everyone else as more crunching noises filled the 
air, the result of Dyvach eating the remainder of the glass shards. 

&quot;Hey, hey, hey!&quot; Alex protested. &quot;Eat the glass, not the mirror!&quot; 

Maze gave the oversized spider a strange look. &quot;I hope you&#39;re just 
doing that to analyze the glass,&quot; he said guardedly. 

Dyvach chittered an affirmative and resumed chiming the oddly 
beautiful musical pattern of the chemical structure of the glass. Its 
carapace flushed a dark purple hue for a moment before assuming a 
dusky rose coloring. The melody continued for several minutes before 
Dyvach abruptly turned a vivid pink color and fell silent. 

Michelle made a face, more at having the music interrupted than 
anything. &quot;Is everything okay?&quot; she asked. She received a flatulent 
chime in response and cast a startled look at Maze. &quot;What did he say?&quot; 

Maze raised a purple eyebrow at the weaver. &quot;You want what?&quot; He 
listened as Dyvach explained at length what exactly it needed and why. 
&quot;You lost me on that last word, but I think I get the general idea.&quot; 
Dyvach replied with a harsh chime of denial before flushing a dark 
purple color once again. 

&quot;Not so loud,&quot; Whisper complained as the weaver&#39;s crude psionic voice 
intruded into her mind. &quot;It says that the glass is composed of several 
very rare elements mixed with a highly refined grade of sand,&quot; she 
explained to the group. &quot;I don&#39;t quite get what it wants, but I keep 
seeing a small hourglass filled with sparkling sand.&quot; 

Susan blinked. &quot;The Sands of Time?&quot; she asked Dyvach. She got a rather 
happy chime in response and she paused for a moment to think. &quot;That&#39;s 
a rather exotic substance to be used for forging a reflective 
mirror....&quot; 

Alex rolled her eyes at the ceiling. &quot;Here we go again, somebody needs 
a very rare thing that you can only gather once a generation under the 
light of a blue moon during a solstice or some other crap,&quot; she 
grumbled quietly. &quot;And of course, being the eternal packrat that you 
are, you probably have some of whatever it is we need stashed away 
either in your keep in the Border Ethereal or in the keep you have in 
Hell.&quot; 

The succubus gave her an exasperated look. &quot;Time-sand is not as rare 
as you think, Alex. And yes, I have several small hourglasses filled 
with it in my Border Ethereal keep, as it becomes volatile when in the 
Underworld.&quot; 

Michelle managed to almost completely muffle her giggle as Alex 
smirked. &quot;Your honor, the prosecution rests,&quot; the blonde replied. 

Susan just shook her head to herself. &quot;I will return shortly,&quot; she 
said as she snatched at the air. Her staff seemed to materialize out 
of nowhere as it smacked solidly into the palm of her hand. 

&quot;Hey, where did that come from?&quot; Maze said as he blinked in surprise. 

&quot;A long story,&quot; Susan replied as she tilted her head to look under the 
coffee table. &quot;Myst, would you like to come with me?&quot; 

The silky gray kitten wasted no time in leaving the relative sanctity 
of the coffee table to stand next to her. Susan cradled her arm 
against her hip and Myst promptly leapt up, landing neatly in the 
space provided. &quot;Thank you,&quot; the Shinma said quietly. 

&quot;Aww, we&#39;re not that bad,&quot; Alex chuckled as she reached over to 
scratch Myst&#39;s ears. 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised,&quot; the kitten replied flatly. 

&quot;Be nice,&quot; Susan said gently as Alex made a face. She looked up at the 
pair of humans and readjusted her grip on her staff. &quot;I should only be 
gone for a few minutes,&quot; she said. &quot;I need to change first, then I 
shall return with some time-sand for Dyvach.&quot; 

Maze&#39;s eyebrows arched up as he glanced over her attire. &quot;Don&#39;t change 
on our account,&quot; he muttered, then dodged the kick that Alex aimed at 
his leg. &quot;Hey, be careful. You would almost think we were friends or 
something with a gesture like that,&quot; he teased. 

&quot;Whatever,&quot; the blonde muttered darkly. 

Susan smiled. &quot;Thank you, Lieutenant, I think you just made my day,&quot; 
she said before disappearing in a flash of temporal energy. 

Maze blinked in confusion for a moment before casting a questioning 
look at Alex and Michelle. &quot;Did that make any sense to either of you?&quot; 

Michelle sighed quietly as she rested her head on Alex&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;Not at all,&quot; the blonde said with a careful shrug. &quot;Vintage Susan 
Meiou for you. Always cryptic, never explains the important things 
until the last second.&quot; 

The Dragoon looked at her for a moment before shrugging as well. 
&quot;Okay, nothing like a little mystery to keep life interesting. That 
smells good,&quot; he added as he wandered into the kitchen. 

&quot;Go away,&quot; came the other voice from the kitchen. 

Alex just looked at Michelle, glanced down at the giant crystal spider 
cooing at her feet, looked into the kitchen to observe two people from 
another world casually fighting over a loaf of bread, then looked back 
at her lover. &quot;I&#39;m not sure which bothers me worse,&quot; she said quietly 
as she ran her fingers through Michelle&#39;s aquamarine hair. &quot;The fact 
that the day has been filled with strange things, or the fact that the 
day is far from over and there is still plenty of room for things to 
get stranger....&quot;

* 

Alex looked around the table as she and Michelle sat down to eat 
lunch. &quot;So where is everyone?&quot; she asked Whisper. &quot;And what&#39;s with the 
bread?&quot; 

&quot;Maze is unlocking the arsenal vault for Dyvach so it can nibble on 
the battleship armor plate we have stored in there,&quot; the telepath 
explained. &quot;It said something about needing the extra neutrons. 
Tolaris is probably still dealing with the anti-radiation treatment, 
and I believe Susan is still busy changing.&quot; 

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t take this long,&quot; Alex grumbled quietly as she picked up 
a fork and studied the bowl of salad. &quot;Especially seeing how she was 
barely dressed to begin with. No croutons, huh?&quot; 

&quot;What kind of bread is that?&quot; Michelle asked quickly, more to 
interrupt Alex&#39;s impending rant than out of curiosity. 

Whisper picked up the loaf of denizen wheat bread and began to slice 
it into chunks. &quot;V&#39;etu,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Gezundheit,&quot; Alex replied. 

Whisper shot her an unamused look. &quot;It&#39;s a type of wheat bread from 
the Southern Flatlands region. Here, try some,&quot; she offered as she 
held out a chunk of the dark brown bread. 

The blonde gave it a dubious look before accepting it. She sniffed at 
it cautiously before taking a small bite. She chewed for a few moments 
before swallowing, trying to decide if she liked the rather bland 
taste. &quot;You know,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;This isn&#39;t too bad. Recently 
made, which is always a bonus. A little seasoning would go for a lot, 
but I bet it would make a good crouton.&quot; 

Whisper rasied a questioning eyebrow as Michelle quietly rolled her 
eyes. &quot;You and croutons,&quot; she said teasingly as she reached for the 
soup tureen. &quot;Almost as bad as the Princess and sugar.&quot; 

Alex frowned at her. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with croutons?&quot; she said as she 
began to pile the salad mixture onto her plate. &quot;They taste good and 
add a little crunchy texture. Speaking of which, what kind of dressing 
do we have?&quot; 

Whisper glanced at the bottles briefly. &quot;Italian, Catalina, and White 
N&#39;Taki Seven.&quot; 

Both Alex and Michelle paused. &quot;What, what, and what?&quot; Alex said 
slowly. 

There was a soft grunt as Tolaris walked into the dining room wearing 
a loose-fitting tank-top and sweatpants. His skin had turned a shade 
of dark pink that most people associated with a light sunburn. &quot;What 
was the question again?&quot; he asked as he sat down in slow-motion, the 
pain evident on his face. 

Alex raised an eyebrow at him. &quot;I asked what kind of salad dressing we 
have, but I&#39;ve never heard of any of them. You alright?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve had better days,&quot; Tolaris said as he studied the selections laid 
out for lunch. &quot;White N&#39;Taki is a somewhat popular brand of condiment, 
and the number just denotes which type. Six and Seven are often used 
in salads, but Ra&#39;vel is rather forcefully allergic to Six so we 
didn&#39;t bother stocking it. Don&#39;t ask me about the stuff that 
originates from Earth. What kind of soup is that, Michelle?&quot; 

&quot;Looks like chicken noodle to me,&quot; Michelle replied as she ladled some 
of the soup into her bowl. &quot;You going to want some?&quot; she asked Alex. 

Alex leaned over to get a better look at the soup. &quot;Smells good. Let&#39;s 
just hope that&#39;s chicken, though.&quot; 

Michelle paused in mid-motion and gave Whisper an uncertain look. 
&quot;This is chicken noodle, right?&quot; 

Whisper chuckled quietly. &quot;That&#39;s what the can said. At least, that 
was what was on the label before Dyvach ate it,&quot; she added. 

Alex just shook her head. &quot;An oversized spider with delusions of being 
a chameleon that likes eating glass and metal cans. Now I&#39;ve seen it 
all.&quot; 

Tolaris grunted quietly in amusement. &quot;You should watch it eat trees. 
So what is Dyvach trying to build this time?&quot; he asked as Michelle 
carefully passed the soup tureen over to him. &quot;Thank you.&quot; 

&quot;He&#39;s trying to fix Michelle&#39;s mirror,&quot; Alex replied as she picked up 
the bottle of Italian salad dressing and studied the label. &quot;At least 
they didn&#39;t screw up the Roman alphabet in the past thousand years,&quot; 
she said to herself. 

&quot;It,&quot; Tolaris corrected. &quot;Weavers don&#39;t develop a gender until a later 
stage of their lives, so Dyvach is technically a neuter.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;There&#39;s a charming thought,&quot; she muttered. &quot;Back to the 
salad dressing....&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Serena and Mina like the Italian, Ami and Rei 
prefer Catalina, and Leda usually makes her own red wine vinaigrette 
that only Rei&#39;s sense of taste is overly adverse to.&quot; 

&quot;Huh,&quot; Alex commented as she debated between the Italian and Catalina. 
&quot;So when did Leda learn how to cook, by the way? I mean, she&#39;s always 
been good help in the kitchen when the staff let her in, but I didn&#39;t 
think she was a master chef or anything.&quot; 

&quot;You need to ask her, not me,&quot; Tolaris replied with a casual shrug as 
he ladled some soup into his bowl. 

&quot;You&#39;re a lot of help,&quot; the blonde grunted as she finally decided to 
go for the Catalina and grabbed the bottle. She shook it vigorously 
for a few moments to make sure it was thoroughly mixed, then set it 
down to open it. She paused as she realized that the top of the bottle 
was oddly shaped with a small indentation on the lid. &quot;Okay, stupid 
question time. How do I open this?&quot; 

Both Whisper and Tolaris raised an eyebrow. &quot;Push down on the back of 
the lid to open up the spout in the front,&quot; Tolaris explained gently. 

Alex complied with the instructions and jammed her thumb down on the 
small depression in the back. The front popped up with a wet noise 
that sent tiny droplets of salad dressing on a ballistic arc. She 
flinched as her cheek was flecked with small spots of Catalina and 
sighed heavily, giving the Dragoon a dour look. 

&quot;Air bubble, happens to everyone,&quot; Tolaris observed with a moderate 
degree of humor. &quot;Just don&#39;t shake it so forcefully next time.&quot; 

Alex glared at him as she grabbed the napkin in Michelle&#39;s lap. &quot;I&#39;ll 
try to keep that in mind,&quot; she growled, then blinked as a flash of 
temporal light filled the room. 

Susan tilted her head to one side as she surveyed the room she had 
just time-shifted into. She had exchanged her minimalistic ribbon 
attire for a dark green long-sleeved evening gown that gave everyone 
else a faint sensation of being under-dressed. &quot;I hope I&#39;m not late 
for lunch,&quot; she said demurely as she leaned her staff against the 
wall. She paused as she noticed the small spray of salad dressing on 
Alex&#39;s cheek. &quot;Alex, what did you do this time?&quot; 

Alex heard a muffled giggle next to her and decided to ignore it. &quot;I 
should have gone with the Italian,&quot; she griped as she wiped her face 
with the napkin. 

Susan raised a delicate green eyebrow and decided not to pursue the 
matter any further. She shifted Myst&#39;s weight in her arm and moved 
towards one of the unoccupied chairs at the table. She carefully set 
the kitten down at the far end of the table, away from everyone else, 
and then put a small but very ornate hourglass down on the table. &quot;I 
found what Dyvach wanted,&quot; she said simply as she sat down. 

Everyone paused to stare at the hourglass. The highly-polished ends 
had been fashioned from an exotic type of wood and the slender glass 
seemed to be sculpted from transparent ice. The sand at the bottom of 
the device sparkled like diamond-dust, each individual grain seeming 
to refract the light into a collection of miniature rainbows. 

&quot;That&#39;s beautiful,&quot; Whisper said quietly and heads nodded in 
agreement. 

&quot;The Sands of Time,&quot; Susan explained with just a hint of pride. &quot;The 
eternal flow of Time can never be stopped, but with a device like this 
and the right knowledge, one can briefly alter its course.&quot; 

Tolaris blinked. &quot;So why did you bring that here?&quot; he inquired. 

&quot;Dyvach wanted to use the sand to reforge the glass in Michelle&#39;s 
mirror,&quot; she explained as she studied the bowl of salad. &quot;I am not 
fully sanguine about the idea of using time-sand to make common glass, 
to be honest, but I plan on having the mirror redone by a master 
craftsman if anything goes awry. Did you eat all the croutons already, 
Alex?&quot; 

Alex grumbed something inarticulate to herself as she drizzled the 
orange Catalina over her salad. &quot;No, Chancellor, I didn&#39;t eat the 
croutons,&quot; she said as she set the bottle down on the table. &quot;There 
weren&#39;t any to begin with.&quot; 

&quot;V&#39;etu-k&#39;er kun shi&#39;ana,&quot; Whisper said in response to the questioning 
look on Tolaris&#39; face. &quot;Leda never showed me how to make them the way 
humans like them, so I didn&#39;t bother this time.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;I didn&#39;t know what they were called. Not that I 
like them to begin with,&quot; he said as he picked up a spoon and started 
to eat his bowl of chicken noodle soup. 

&quot;What&#39;s a crouton?&quot; Myst asked Susan as the succubus scooped some of 
the salad mixture into her bowl. 

&quot;A small square of toasted bread, usually seasoned with spices, 
commonly used in salads,&quot; Susan replied off-handedly. &quot;They are a 
touch difficult to make as the bread is easily burnt or over-baked if 
not watched carefully. Can someone tell me what salad dressings we 
have?&quot; 

&quot;Here we go,&quot; Alex muttered to Michelle. 

Whisper gave the blonde a partially amused look. &quot;Italian, Catalina, 
and White N&#39;Taki Seven.&quot; 

Susan blinked for a moment. &quot;I trust that is safe for humans?&quot; 

The Dragoon nodded. &quot;Ami scanned it with her computer and said that 
the worst that could happen is a minor case of gas cramps. Which is 
pretty mild compared to what some of your spices can do to our 
digestive systems,&quot; he said with a grimace. &quot;Ami wasn&#39;t impressed with 
the taste, but she didn&#39;t report any discomfort.&quot; 

&quot;Interesting,&quot; Susan commented as she reached for the dark plastic 
bottle with the denizen label on it. 

&quot;Uhh, Sue is that a good idea?&quot; Alex cautioned. &quot;I know you think that 
you can withstand an awful lot because of your heritage, and you&#39;re 
probably right, but do we really need to risk you running around with 
a case of gas?&quot; 

&quot;Alex!&quot; Michelle admonished her best friend with an embarrased blush. 

Susan gave the blonde a reproving look. &quot;I assure you that I will be 
quite fine,&quot; she said dryly as she opened the bottle and peered 
inside. She blinked at what she saw and gave Tolaris a questioning 
look. 

Tolaris chuckled quietly. &quot;Yes, it&#39;s supposed to be that color, even 
though the brand name is White N&#39;Taki.&quot; 

Susan sniffed the denizen salad dressing for a moment before she 
shrugged and poured it in the corner of her bowl. &quot;The smell is 
definitely unusual,&quot; she commented. 

Alex&#39;s eyebrows nearly hit the roof. &quot;Electric-blue salad dressing?&quot; 

The succubus gave her an unamused look as she speared a piece of 
lettuce with her fork and dabbed it in the unusually-colored salad 
dressing. Both Alex and Michelle waited in nervous silence as Susan 
took a bite and chewed slowly. &quot;Well?&quot; Alex prompted after several 
seconds. 

Susan shrugged. &quot;It won&#39;t become my favorite type of salad dressing, 
but it is still quite interesting. You should always try new things, 
Alex.&quot; 

The blonde rolled her eyes. &quot;Yes, mother,&quot; she said dryly as she began 
to voraciously devour her own salad. 

Whisper just shook her head. &quot;So what is your favorite, if I may ask?&quot; 

Alex muttered something very quietly to herself around a mouthful of 
iceberg lettuce and shredded cheese. The only person who could hear 
her was Michelle, who promptly choked on her soup and immediately 
clamped her hands over her mouth, her aquamarine eyes wide with shock. 

&quot;A raspberry and walnut vinaigrette that I discovered during a visit 
to seventeenth-century Baghdad,&quot; Susan replied as she gave Alex an icy 
look. &quot;I have the recipe on file in my keep somewhere. Are you 
alright, Michelle?&quot; 

Alex smirked and gently rubbed her lover&#39;s back. &quot;Wrong pipe, honey?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Michelle managed to cough out, her cheeks burning crimson. 

Tolaris picked up his wineglass and swirled the amber contents around. 
&quot;Where&#39;s Maze?&quot; he asked before he took a sip. 

As if on cue, the stairwell door opened to admit Maze and Ra&#39;vel into 
the living room. They were having a rather animated discussion about 
something in a denizen dialect that neither Whisper nor Tolaris could 
easily identify. The matter was complicated by both Ra&#39;vel&#39;s 
disjointed speech patterns and the fact that she currently sounded 
almost identical to a very irritated parakeet. 

&quot;Lieutenant!&quot; Tolaris said sharply as the volume increased a notch. 

Both Maze and Ra&#39;vel fell silent, giving him a curious look. &quot;Which 
one?&quot; Maze ventured. 

&quot;Both of you,&quot; the Dragoon commander replied. &quot;I could care less what 
you&#39;re arguing about, but please don&#39;t do it so loudly near the dinner 
table.&quot; 

Maze chuckled quietly as he and Ra&#39;vel approached the unoccupied 
chairs. &quot;Sorry, boss,&quot; he said as Ra&#39;vel chirped an apology. &quot;We were 
just going over this morning&#39;s incident report from K&#39;tal and 
discussing what we would have done in the same situation.&quot; 

Everyone blinked as Tolaris&#39; mood visibly darkened. &quot;Have a seat and 
some soup,&quot; he suggested quietly as he sipped at his wine. 

&quot;Afternoon, ladies,&quot; Maze said charmingly as he sat down between Susan 
and Tolaris. Ra&#39;vel took the empty seat between Tolaris and Whisper, 
not noticing the unsettled look from Michelle directly across her. 

&quot;That&#39;s stretching the term,&quot; Alex muttered. 

Susan sighed quietly. &quot;In one sense, you&#39;re absolutely right,&quot; she 
said dryly. &quot;In another sense, however, he is quite accurate.&quot; 

Michelle finished wiping her mouth with a napkin and gave Susan an odd 
look. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;V&#39;etu?&quot; Whisper offered as a chunk of the bread was telekinetically 
lifted into the air and migrated over to Maze&#39;s plate. 

&quot;M&#39;sen,&quot; Maze replied. 

&quot;Both you and Alex are Ladies of your respective houses,&quot; Susan said. 

Tolaris frowned as the color drained out of Alex&#39;s face. &quot;That doesn&#39;t 
sound like it&#39;s a bad thing,&quot; he said slowly. 

&quot;It&#39;s a painful reminder that our mothers are dead,&quot; Alex said flatly 
as Michelle slid her hand into Alex&#39;s, gently intertwining their 
fingers. 

Susan sighed quietly. &quot;It has to do with the social structure of the 
Moon Kingdom,&quot; she explained to the denizens. &quot;Upon the death of her 
mother or the birth of her daughter, which ever comes first, a Sailor 
Scout is granted the title of nobility of her House. For instance, I 
became Lady Pluto at the age of nineteen when my mother died, and 
Amelia became Lady Mercury when she gave birth to Ami.&quot; 

Alex sighed heavily. &quot;Yeah, yeah, so technically I&#39;m Lady Uranus now,&quot; 
she growled. &quot;Doesn&#39;t mean you have to remind us.&quot; 

Susan shrugged as she reached for her glass of wine. &quot;You&#39;re still 
part of the nobility, even if you don&#39;t act like it or care to hear it 
said.&quot; 

&quot;Stuff it, Sue.&quot; 

&quot;What incident report were you talking about?&quot; Whisper asked in an 
attempt to break the dark turn of the conversation. 

Ra&#39;vel made a flat squawk and Maze just shook his head. &quot;Another fun 
trap of somebody&#39;s,&quot; he sighed. &quot;We&#39;re guessing Rune, but it could 
also have been your friend Al&#39;vexi or Si&#39;ren.&quot; 

Whisper scowled at the Dragoon. &quot;Al&#39;vexi isn&#39;t that type of woman.&quot; 

&quot;I beg to differ,&quot; Tolaris said politely. &quot;I&#39;ve seen her set a few.... 
shall we say, less-than-pleasant bureaucratic snares for people 
before.&quot; 

The telepath sighed heavily as she stabbed a cherry tomato with her 
fork, almost causing it to explode. &quot;Politics,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Should I 
ask what went on this time?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged casually as he continued to swirl the wine in his 
glass. &quot;Test-firing of the particle-wave cannon in the Headquarters 
Complex, came this close to cratering Nop&#39;tera&#39;s carrier. K&#39;tal 
aborted the firing sequence at the last moment, and Internal Review is 
still screaming like it was a case of p&#39;tahk&#39;enn k&#39;shen-tal.&quot; 

Maze choked on a mouthful of wine and nearly spewed it everywhere. 
&quot;Was it really necessary to phrase it like that?&quot; he gasped as he 
accepted a napkin from Whisper. 

&quot;Really, Commander,&quot; Whisper chided the Dragoon, &quot;You of all people 
should have better manners than that. At the dinner table, in front of 
ladies?&quot; 

Alex cast a sidelong glance at Susan. &quot;So what&#39;d he say?&quot; 

&quot;Nothing I&#39;m going to repeat,&quot; Whisper replied dryly. 

The blonde crossed her arms. &quot;Well, that&#39;s no fun.&quot; 

&quot;Leave it alone, Alex,&quot; Susan sighed heavily. 

&quot;Spoilsport.&quot; 

Maze shook his head. &quot;You remind me of Leda.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, she&#39;s a trip, alright,&quot; Alex replied with a smirk. &quot;Trust me, 
we get along quite well. Umm, you going to be alright with that?&quot; she 
asked as she noticed Ra&#39;vel filling up her bowl with chicken noodle 
soup. 

Ra&#39;vel telepathed back. 

Alex swallowed hard. &quot;It&#39;s not the noodles I was referring to.&quot; 

&quot;Alex,&quot; Susan chided her. 

The blonde spread her hands helplessly. &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just saying that 
it&#39;s somewhat unusual to see a giant bird eating chicken soup, that&#39;s 
all.&quot; 

Susan just sighed up at the ceiling as Michelle&#39;s expression took on a 
pained look. &quot;Alex, is it asking too much for you to be on your best 
behavior whenever you are at a dinner table, or to at least make some 
attempt at a modicum of diplomacy?&quot; she said in a weary tone. 

&quot;You really want me to answer that one, Sue?&quot; 

&quot;Rhetorical question, I assure you.&quot; 

Maze leaned back in his chair with a faint smirk, the gesture not 
passing unnoticed by Tolaris. &quot;Lieutenant,&quot; he said quietly as he set 
his wineglass down on the table with a muted thump. 

&quot;Sir,&quot; Maze replied with sudden wariness. 

&quot;I heard that thought from here,&quot; Tolaris said evenly. 

Whisper raised an eyebrow. &quot;Not bad for a psi-mute,&quot; she commented. 

&quot;You people are strange,&quot; Myst spoke up from her corner of the table. 

Alex chuckled. &quot;Great, now the cat is busting on us,&quot; she teased. 

&quot;So much for decorum,&quot; Susan muttered to herself as she picked up her 
wineglass and idly toyed with it. 

Maze chuckled. &quot;What&#39;s wrong with having a casual atmosphere between 
friends?&quot; he observed cheerfully. 

&quot;Speak for yourself,&quot; Alex muttered. 

Susan sighed quietly. &quot;That will be enough, Alex.&quot; 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;You should see how some nights go when everyone is 
here,&quot; she said. &quot;It can get pretty interesting at times. No, not like 
that,&quot; she amended as Susan put her head in her hands. &quot;They are 
wonderful people to know, and I&#39;m rather glad we met them. They are 
just.... young and full of the exuberence of youth.&quot; 

Maze looked up at the ceiling. &quot;I wonder if they got the pizza stains 
off the ceiling yet?&quot; he mused. 

Both Alex and Michelle reflexively glanced up at the spot he was 
looking at. &quot;I don&#39;t see anything,&quot; Alex frowned. &quot;And what&#39;s pizza?&quot; 

&quot;No need to worry, Susan,&quot; Tolaris said gently as there was a very 
heavy sigh from the end of the table. &quot;They are well-behaved for the 
most part, I assure you.&quot; 

Michelle blinked as there was a muffled grunt from beneath the mass of 
dark green hair. &quot;Susan, are you alright?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m fine,&quot; Susan said quietly. &quot;I&#39;m just putting off my plans to have 
children for another century or two, that&#39;s all.&quot; She lifted her head 
up to level an icy glare at Alex as the blonde&#39;s laughter filled the 
room. 

Whisper shrugged. &quot;Nothing wrong with waiting until you&#39;re ready.&quot; 

&quot;Or keeping in practice until then,&quot; Maze added with a wicked grin. 

&quot;Oh boy, let&#39;s not go there,&quot; Alex snickered, drawing yet another 
heavy sigh from Susan. 

&quot;Indeed, as it is wise not to discuss a complicated topic of 
significance in which you have no personal knowledge of that could be 
construed as being of remote usefulness or pertinence,&quot; Susan said in 
an edged tone as she drained her glass of wine. 

&quot;So back to the incident report,&quot; Whisper said quickly as Alex gave 
the succubus an unamused look that bordered on being openly hostile. 

Tolaris rubbed the bridge of his nose. &quot;I haven&#39;t had the chance to 
talk to K&#39;tal about it, as he&#39;s a bit busy at the moment. He had 
Ael&#39;ien with him at the time as a neutral observer, and I&#39;m told she 
was just as disturbed about the whole incident as he was.&quot; 

The telepath frowned. &quot;They must really be hurting for people if Ael 
has been put in command of the Psi-Corp,&quot; she sighed. &quot;Don&#39;t get me 
wrong, she&#39;s definitely a good person, but she could use a bit more 
seasoning as a senior executive officer before moving up to a 
divisional post.&quot; 

&quot;Problem on the home front?&quot; Alex inquired as she munched on the 
remains of her Catalina-doused salad. 

&quot;I&#39;m sure the day-to-day events of your Kingdom were at times just as 
much of a concern to the common citizens as they were to the throne,&quot; 
Tolaris said neutrally. &quot;The incident report is bothersome, but 
nothing to lose much sleep over as such situations are not all that 
uncommon in the military.&quot; 

Alex snorted. &quot;If you want to talk about concerns of the throne, 
you&#39;re in the right company. Sue over there practically ran things.&quot; 

Susan rolled her eyes at the ceiling. &quot;Your persistent failure to 
grasp the mechanics of running a small and geographically isolated 
kingdom continues to amaze me, Alex, even though I&#39;ve explained it 
seven different ways to you. I never ran the Kingdom, only ensured 
that the daily functions and duties were coordinated and executed 
while minimizing the level of disruption and potential confusion.&quot; 

&quot;The Queen gives the orders and she cracks the whip,&quot; Alex explained. 

Susan&#39;s knuckles went white as she unconsciously tightened her grip on 
her salad fork. &quot;That is not the case, Alex, nor has it ever been. I 
am the Queen&#39;s Chancellor, it is my duty to take the burden of daily 
minutiae off of the throne so that the Queen may focus on the truly 
important decision of the Kingdom, and even then she is made aware of 
what sort of decisions are being made in her name should she desire to 
have them changed to suit her needs.&quot; 

The denizens exchanged glances before leaning back in their respective 
chairs. &quot;Now there&#39;s an interesting concept,&quot; Maze mused aloud. &quot;A 
Queen&#39;s personal aide, if you will. Of course, you&#39;d have to pick 
someone you utterly trust, which is asking quite a bit in our world, 
but still....&quot; 

Tolaris snorted. &quot;Nothing new about it, Maze. We&#39;ve had them in the 
military since the start. They&#39;re called executive officers.&quot; 

Maze blinked for a moment. &quot;Huh, never thought of it like that.&quot; 

There was a leery pause from the elder Dragoon. &quot;And how did you think 
of it as?&quot; he finally asked. 

Maze smirked as he leaned back, his tan eyes twinkling with amusement. 
&quot;A gopher comes to mind,&quot; he said. &quot;You know.... go for this, go for 
that, oh by the way, can you draw up that quarterly budget analysis 
the Queen wants before dinner tonight?&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;I only asked you to do that once because both myself 
and Shar-Tei were literally up to our knees in liquid adhesive after 
that holding tank in the Lex&#39;eri storage facility ruptured and we 
couldn&#39;t go anywhere because we were quite literally stuck in our 
tracks.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;That must have been fun,&quot; she commented. 

&quot;What, his situation or mine?&quot; Maze replied. &quot;To be perfectly honest, 
after doing that report, which was done with about six full minutes to 
spare, I would have preferred to have spent the day stuck to the floor 
as well. You never did tell me how they managed to get you two out of 
that,&quot; he added. 

Tolaris grunted softly. &quot;They waited until the adhesive solidified, 
then put a liquid polymer lubricant down our pants to help us get out 
of them.&quot; 

There was a sharp chirp of laughter from Ra&#39;vel and Maze looked to be 
visibly biting his tongue. &quot;So you ended up leaving your pants 
behind?&quot; Maze somehow managed to say with a straight face. 

&quot;It was not a shining moment for personal dignity,&quot; Tolaris replied 
with a sigh. &quot;Shar-Tei&#39;s sense of humor throughout the whole incident 
could have used a little work as well, but at least the rescue crews 
had the presence of mind to have a few blankets available.&quot; 

&quot;Show some respect, Alex,&quot; Susan sighed as the blonde erupted into 
peals of laughter. Next to her, Michelle was suffering from a mild 
attack of the giggles as well, but at least she kept the volume down 
to a tolerable level. &quot;Or should I tell them about the beach incident 
last year?&quot; she added. 

&quot;Oh, do tell,&quot; Maze said languidly as Alex&#39;s laughter died down. 

&quot;Please,&quot; Alex said as she rolled her eyes. &quot;Okay, so I wasn&#39;t 
watching the ocean waves while walking along the beach and a rogue 
wave ended up taking most of my swimsuit out with the tide. You happy 
now?&quot; 

Susan gave her a small smile. &quot;No, and neither was the Queen, but I 
can assure you that the Prince and his squire were.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, whatever,&quot; Alex grumbled. &quot;Like you have any room to talk about 
being out of uniform or otherwise undressed at various intervals.&quot; 

Maze chuckled quietly. &quot;Ladies, please. Unless you plan on doing a few 
re-enactments for us, kindly don&#39;t tease us with such stories,&quot; he 
said with a lecherous grin. 

&quot;Lieutenant Maze, shame on you,&quot; Whisper sighed. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Tolaris added with a disapproving glare. 

Alex smirked. &quot;Don&#39;t ask Sue, she just might show you.&quot; 

Michelle blushed and poked her in the shoulder. &quot;Alex!&quot; she 
admonished. 

&quot;Alexis Ten&#39;ou, that is enough,&quot; Susan said with a heavy sigh of her 
own. 

&quot;Hey, can I ask a personal question?&quot; Maze asked as he leaned forward 
to pick up his glass of wine. 

&quot;Depending,&quot; Alex said warily. 

&quot;Your name is Alexis, but you prefer to go by Alex, right?&quot; 

Alex raised an eyebrow. &quot;Damn straight, and don&#39;t let me hear you call 
me Alexis or I&#39;m going to shorten your name with my saber. Clear?&quot; 

The Dragoon just chuckled. &quot;I was just wondering, that&#39;s all. Believe 
me, it is a very serious point of protocol in our society to call 
someone by what they want to be called. To do so otherwise is a 
grievous insult at best, and an invitation to a duel at worst.&quot; 

&quot;May I ask you a question about denizen names?&quot; Susan asked as Alex 
leaned back in her chair and rubbed Michelle&#39;s arm. 

Maze smirked. &quot;About our naming conventions?&quot; 

&quot;Exactly.&quot; 

&quot;Tag, Tolaris, you&#39;re it,&quot; Maze said with a chuckle as he refilled his 
wineglass. 

Tolaris shot a bemused look towards his friend. &quot;When a denizen enters 
military service, it is viewed as the first step in a new life. We are 
given the choice of assuming a new name and identity, sort of 
symbolically leaving our past behind. The choice of the name is a 
personal one, of course, but it often reflects a hidden meaning to the 
individual. Not everyone chooses to do so, but those who do are 
accorded every respect as if their chosen name was their birth-name. 
And before you ask, it is considered an epitome of rudeness to ask 
anyone about their birth-name or their previous life.&quot; 

Alex blinked. &quot;So I&#39;m guessing you weren&#39;t born with the name Maze?&quot; 

Maze stretched and ran his hands through his spiky purple hair. 
&quot;Fairly reasonable assumption, but does it really matter?&quot; he said 
languidly. 

&quot;That makes some sense now,&quot; Michelle quietly spoke up. 

&quot;Indeed,&quot; Susan said with a slow nod of her head. &quot;Thank you for 
helping clarify that matter for me.&quot; 

&quot;There&#39;s a denizen saying,&quot; Maze replied, &quot;What&#39;s in a name?&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s an Earth saying,&quot; Alex interjected. 

Whisper sighed. &quot;Not this argument again....&quot; 

Susan tilted her head to one side. &quot;How was it resolved earlier?&quot; 

&quot;Simple issue, really,&quot; Tolaris said with a shrug. &quot;It&#39;s our saying 
for the simple fact that our culture and society has been around for a 
far greater time than yours has.&quot; 

Michelle and Alex exchanged glances. &quot;He might have a point,&quot; Michelle 
said softly as she squeezed Alex&#39;s hand. 

&quot;Bah, don&#39;t matter to me,&quot; Alex said with a wave of her free hand. She 
paused for a moment and looked around the room. &quot;Hey, anyone hear 
something?&quot; 

Everyone held perfectly still for a few moments, straining their ears 
before they could detect a series of faint scratching sounds. &quot;I think 
it&#39;s coming from over there,&quot; Michelle said as she pointed to the 
stairwell door. 

Tolaris rose from the table and crossed the room to the door. He 
listened at the door for a moment before opening it, stepping back in 
surprise at the sight of Dyvach in the stairwell. &quot;You okay?&quot; 

The weaver&#39;s carapace was literally glowing with a neon green color as 
it very slowly crawled along the floor, unable to lift its abdomen 
completely off the floor. It moved in eerie silence, slowly making its 
way in the general direction of the fireplace. 

&quot;Dyvach, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; Tolaris asked with concern. 

A pale purple color infused itself into the neon green glow as Dyvach 
tried to reach out with its rudimentary telepathic mind to contact 
Whisper. &quot;I think its got gas,&quot; Whisper said after a moment. 
&quot;Something about a very heavy elemental reaction. All I can make out 
is that it wants a box of matches and a wide clearance around it.&quot; 

Alex chuckled quietly. &quot;If I ate soup cans, I&#39;d probably have gas 
too.&quot; 

&quot;Eww,&quot; Michelle whimpered at the mental image. 

&quot;Great,&quot; Tolaris muttered. &quot;Can you talk?&quot; 

Whisper frowned as the psionic voice intruded in her mind again. &quot;I 
think it&#39;s doing all it can to hold it in. The image I keep seeing is 
it igniting a match and venting into the fireplace.&quot; 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;Take it outside, Dyvach.&quot; 

Dyvach tapped a leg against the floor repeatedly as it continued to 
make its way to the fireplace, still glowing. &quot;I think that might be a 
bad idea, Commander,&quot; Whisper said with a frown. &quot;I keep seeing some 
sort of molecular structure in my mind, but I don&#39;t know what it is.&quot; 

Maze sighed and stood up. &quot;Might as well make sure the flue is open,&quot; 
he muttered as he moved over to the fireplace. 

&quot;It should still be open, unless Rei closed it last night,&quot; Tolaris 
said as he kept a very wary eye on the weaver&#39;s sluggish movements. 

Susan frowned. &quot;Is this going to pose a hazard to us?&quot; 

&quot;Probably not,&quot; Maze said as he got the package of matches off of the 
mantle and set it on the ground where Dyvach could reach them. &quot;I 
would think that Dyvach is smart enough to figure out what kind of 
chemicals it can burn off safely in a fireplace and which ones to take 
outside. Still,&quot; he added as he opened a hidden panel and extracted a 
denizen-model fire extinguisher, &quot;It wouldn&#39;t hurt to keep this 
available.&quot; 

&quot;That better be AC-44,&quot; Whisper warned from from the table. 

Maze tossed an insulted glance over his shoulder. &quot;Like I&#39;d use AC-73 
in an open environment,&quot; he said evenly. He watched as Dyvach finally 
reached the fireplace and grabbed the pack of matches. &quot;Okay, people, 
let&#39;s hope this is just going to be a form of entertainment.&quot; 

&quot;Fire in the hole,&quot; Alex chuckled as the weaver lit a match and aimed 
it at the center of the fireplace. Her eyes went wide as a truly 
thunderous belch echoed in the room, immediately followed by an arc of 
green flame. &quot;Hot damn, and I thought Susan&#39;s idea of spicy chili gave 
you some wicked gas....&quot; 

&quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; Susan said before another arc of fire crossed the 
distance between Dyvach&#39;s mouth and the back wall of the fireplace. 
There was a very disgrunted chime from the weaver as it took a deep 
breath, lit another match, and braced its many legs. 

&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Alex breathed in awe as Dyvach began a sustained venting 
of the highly volatile gas, essentially turning itself into a 
crystalline flame- thrower that bathed the back wall of the fireplace 
in emerald fire. 

&quot;Yeah, venting something like that outside might have been unwise,&quot; 
Maze said casually as he took a few steps back from the fireplace. 
&quot;What do you think, boss, hydrogen-deuterium gas?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;d have said tritium mixed with something else,&quot; Tolaris replied as 
he watched the green glow. &quot;Something highly reactive when exposed to 
oxygen.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped a suggestion and Maze made a face. &quot;Chlorine?&quot; 

Tolaris shook his head. &quot;We&#39;d be dead right now if that was chlorine 
gas being vented.&quot; 

The stream of flame pulsed twice before sputtering out, leaving a 
faint green cloud of smoke rising up from the back wall of the 
fireplace. Dyvach immediately climbed into the fireplace and stuck as 
much of its body up the flue as it could fit. Tolaris was about to ask 
what the problem was when the muffled sound of a very powerful belch 
being released inside a small pipe echoed throughout the room. 

&quot;Now THAT was a belch,&quot; Alex said in amused satisfaction as Dyvach 
slowly crawled out of the fireplace, chiming a lengthy apology to 
everyone. &quot;Let&#39;s hear it for the spider.... OW, hey!&quot; she protested as 
Michelle smacked her in the back of the head. &quot;C&#39;mon, Mich, you have 
to admit that was impressive.&quot; 

&quot;That was disgusting,&quot; Michelle said sourly. 

Susan sighed heavily. &quot;Not everybody revels in juvenile humor as you 
do, Alex. Are you alright, Dyvach?&quot; 

Dyvach made a sour chiming noise as its carapace slowly took on a dark 
blue hue. It made a slight coughing noise and a wisp of smoke curled 
up from its mouth before it slowly started flexing each leg. 

&quot;We don&#39;t need to know how that tasted,&quot; Tolaris said with a sigh and 
a barely-repressed shiver. &quot;What was that, by the way?&quot; He blinked as 
Dyvach immediately turned a deep shade of crimson and began to chitter 
at an unusually rapid pace. &quot;Like I understood any of that,&quot; he 
grumbled. 

Maze chuckled. &quot;Oh, come on, Commander, couldn&#39;t you tell that was the 
chemical formula for the six by-products of a chain reaction involving 
heavy isotopes of hydrogen and certain metallic alloys?&quot; 

Everyone stopped and stared at him as Dyvach made a complex chime of 
confusion. &quot;Okay, okay, so I made that up,&quot; he said with a grin. 

&quot;Ptanka,&quot; Whisper muttered beneath her breath as she rolled her eyes. 

Ra&#39;vel made a flat squawking noise as she picked a cherry tomato out 
of the salad bowl and threw it at him. The tomato flew on a ballistic 
arc before it encountered a strong electromagnetic field around him 
and bounced off in a random direction. 

&quot;Hey, watch it,&quot; Alex yelped as she ducked to avoid the stray 
vegetable. 

&quot;Shields are useful toys,&quot; Maze said with a grin at Ra&#39;vel. 

&quot;Shield this,&quot; Whisper muttered as she focused her psionic powers. 

&quot;Ow, hey, get out of my skull, ow, ay&#39;cha navidshi, ow, that 
hurts....&quot; 

Tolaris and Susan exchanged identical looks of patient suffering as 
Ra&#39;vel chirped with smug satisfaction while Alex winced in sympathy. 
&quot;Angels and ministers of grace, defend us,&quot; Tolaris quoted with a 
sigh. 

&quot;William Shakespeare,&quot; Susan replied promptly. &quot;Hamlet, Act One, Scene 
Four. Ami&#39;s influence, I presume?&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;She says she prefers a more classical flavor to the 
books she chooses to read for entertainment rather than to the... how 
did she phrase it?... &#39;Dry, uncultured, and uneducated tripe of so 
many contemporary authors and so-called poets.&#39;&quot; 

Susan wrinkled her nose. &quot;That&#39;s a bit harsh. Granted you won&#39;t find a 
contemporary Shakespeare in this era, but there are still some very 
fine poets and authors to be found.&quot; 

They both looked down as Dyvach skittered over to them, chittering 
softly in its native language. It made a complex multi-harmonic chime 
as it pointed to the ornate hourglass sitting on the edge of the table 
next to Myst. 

&quot;Go away,&quot; Myst said as her fur began to spike at the sudden 
attention. 

&quot;I think it wants the hourglass,&quot; Susan said reassuringly to the 
kitten. She turned her attention back to Dyvach and studied it 
carefully. &quot;Are you sure about using time-sand for this?&quot; 

&quot;Especially after that reaction,&quot; Tolaris added. He waited while 
Dyvach slowly explained what had happened in as simplistic terms as 
possible. &quot;Well, what did you expect? You said you wanted the extra 
neutrons.&quot; 

The weaver made a dour chiming noise to itself as it flushed a creamy 
shade of brown. It reached beneath its carapace and brought out 
Michelle&#39;s mirror, the polished frame looking decidedly cleaner than 
before. The frame was completely devoid of glass, which gave the 
appearance of having a gaping hole in the center. 

Susan shrugged. &quot;Very well, just be very careful with the sand,&quot; she 
cautioned as she picked up the hourglass and started to loosen the 
nearly invisible fastenings on the end of the device. She paused when 
Dyvach started to chime at her, waving a pair of legs back and forth. 
&quot;What is it?&quot; 

&quot;It says it can just cut a small hole in the glass at the base, drain 
the sand, and patch the hole,&quot; Tolaris translated slowly. &quot;It says 
that you won&#39;t be able to tell that the glass had been breached or 
patched.&quot; 

&quot;If that&#39;s convenient for you,&quot; Susan said with another shrug and 
handed the hourglass to the crystal spider. It manipulated it with its 
legs for a moment to find the best position, then brought the device 
to what passed for its lips. 

&quot;That&#39;s scary,&quot; Alex observed as she craned her neck to observe the 
rate at which the glittering time-sand disappeared from the base of 
the hourglass. 

&quot;Not too fast, Dyvach,&quot; Tolaris cautioned. &quot;Don&#39;t need you to choke or 
get a case of the hiccups.&quot; 

Michelle blinked as Dyvach&#39;s carapace suddenly changed colors, taking 
on the exact same refractive properties as the time-sand. &quot;Ooh, that&#39;s 
pretty,&quot; she cooed as the spider seemed to sparkle in the light. 

&quot;A pretty spider?&quot; Alex teased her. &quot;Never thought I&#39;d hear you saying 
something like that.&quot; Michelle&#39;s expression changed slightly as she 
was reminded of Dyvach&#39;s nature, but she didn&#39;t take her aquamarine 
eyes off of the glittering weaver carapace. 

There was a brief motion from Dyvach&#39;s mouth before it held up the 
empty hourglass to Susan. The succubus carefully took it from the 
weaver and held it up to the light. &quot;You&#39;re right, you can&#39;t tell it 
was punctured,&quot; she said with faint admiration to Tolaris. &quot;Thank you, 
Dyvach.&quot; 

Dyvach chimed back at her before turning a dusky rose color and began 
to hum to itself, analyzing the molecular structure of the sand. The 
almost hypnotic humming continued for several minutes before it fell 
silent and set the mirror down on the ground. It then promptly curled 
up into a smooth, featureless ball in the middle of the floor. 

&quot;Well?&quot; Alex prompted as everyone exchanged glances. 

&quot;How fast can you rework molecular structures?&quot; Tolaris inquired. &quot;I&#39;d 
give it five minutes to digest and reassemble the various components.&quot; 

&quot;So now what?&quot; 

Susan shook her head. &quot;So now the rest of us can finish lunch in 
relative peace and quiet,&quot; she said lightly as she sat back down and 
resumed eating her salad. 

&quot;That wasn&#39;t funny, Captain,&quot; Maze grumbled as he rested his head in 
his hands. &quot;You do realize how much that hurts, right?&quot; 

Whisper snorted. &quot;One thing you need to learn about life, Maze. Don&#39;t 
try to talk to telepaths about headaches anymore than you&#39;d try to 
talk to avians about flying. It&#39;ll fade in a few minutes.&quot; 

&quot;How common is telepathy?&quot; Michelle asked as Alex munched on one of 
the remaining chunks of v&#39;etu. 

&quot;Telepathy or psionics?&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;Psionics are fairly common. 
I think the ratio is somewhere on the order of one denizen in seven 
developing some form of mental skills from the Chaos Factor. Telepathy 
is one of the most wide-spread forms of psionics, but a noticable 
percentage of psionicists lack viable telepathic skills. For example, 
telepathy is actually my strongest psi power, but Ra&#39;vel&#39;s telepathic 
senses aren&#39;t nearly as developed.&quot; 

Susan tilted her head to one side. &quot;Is there some sort of rating 
system for that, by any chance?&quot; 

&quot;Actually, there is,&quot; Whisper said with a nod. &quot;Your average 
non-psionic denizen like Maze is rated a one. I think my psi score was 
seventeen at my last examination, and I believe Ra&#39;vel was rated a 
twelve. Tolaris, on the other hand, is a flat zero because he&#39;s 
totally psi-mute.&quot; 

Maze chuckled. &quot;I&#39;m technically a one-point-two, as my motion tracking 
power counts as an enhanced sensory function in the clairsentience 
portion of the exam, but on the telepathic section I&#39;m a straight 
one-point-zero.&quot; 

The telepath gave him a mischievous grin. &quot;Care to put that point-two 
up against another psi-spike?&quot; she teased. 

&quot;I&#39;d rather be brain-dead like Tolaris in that case,&quot; Maze muttered. 

&quot;Excuse me, Lieutenant,&quot; Tolaris said dryly as Michelle giggled. 

Ra&#39;vel chirped something in amusement and Whisper smiled. &quot;Well, to be 
honest, you don&#39;t register on a telepathic scan for mental function, 
so....&quot; 

The Dragoon just shook his head before draining his wineglass. &quot;Just 
try to keep in mind that being invulnerable to psionic attack has its 
uses,&quot; he said with a wry grin. &quot;Telepaths can&#39;t spike you, for one.&quot; 

&quot;Or try to blow your brains out your ear canal,&quot; Maze suggested. &quot;You 
remember that one incident in the Outreaches, right, Tolaris?&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, Lieutenant.&quot; 

&quot;Eww....&quot; Michelle said with a sour look. 

Whisper shot Maze an unamused look. &quot;Depends on how you try that. A 
strictly telepathic attack won&#39;t work, but if you use a focused 
psychokinetic attack, that&#39;s a whole different issue as that works 
directly on physical matter instead of mental function.&quot; 

Alex frowned, a look of mild confusion on her face. &quot;Meaning...?&quot; 

&quot;Meaning there&#39;s more than one way to give a psi-mute a headache,&quot; 
Tolaris said dryly as he wiped his mouth with a napkin. 

The telepath paused for a moment to give him a measured look. 
&quot;Anything you want to share with the rest of us?&quot; she inquired. 

Tolaris sighed. &quot;I almost had my retinas burnt out once by a warrior 
with a talent for inducing hypnosis with colored sparks of light. I 
could hear the suggestion being planted in my mind, but the visual 
lure was about as bright as a magnesium flare and I think the pain was 
what kept me focused. The headache lasted for three days, and it&#39;s 
nothing I want to experience again.&quot; 

Whisper paused for a moment before she leaned back in her chair, 
fixing Tolaris with a piercing gaze and a look of serious 
contemplation on her face. &quot;I&#39;m missing something,&quot; she said, mostly 
to herself. &quot;There&#39;s a thought out there, a very important detail, I 
know it&#39;s there, but I&#39;m missing it....&quot; 

Both Susan and Michelle promptly looked at Alex, who blinked at the 
sudden focus of attention. &quot;What?&quot; she said around a mouthful of 
v&#39;etu. 

&quot;We had the suspicion that you were about to make an unwelcome 
comment, that&#39;s all,&quot; Susan said lightly with a hint of a smile. 

The blonde just rolled her eyes. &quot;You rip me for speaking my mind, 
then give me funny looks when I hold my tongue,&quot; she griped. &quot;Make up 
your mind.&quot; 

&quot;Silence is golden,&quot; the succubus replied casually. 

&quot;Except when it&#39;s from your left turbine,&quot; Maze muttered. 

&quot;Problem?&quot; Tolaris inquired. 

&quot;Nah, just a minor technical glitch last time I was onboard an aerial 
cruiser,&quot; the lieutenant replied darkly. &quot;The gravity shield on our 
turbine went whack-a-ding-hoy on us, to borrow Mina&#39;s phrase, and we 
ended up landing ptanka-first in the middle of nowhere in a valley up 
north.&quot; 

&quot;Now there&#39;s an interesting turn of phrase,&quot; Alex commented. 

&quot;When was this?&quot; Tolaris asked with a frown. 

&quot;When Shar-Tei was in charge,&quot; Maze replied as he closed his eyes to 
try to remember the details. &quot;If memory serves, it was me, Asrial, 
Chief D&#39;Nina, and Little Q doing a quick cargo-run to the D&#39;Mal 
seaport for something obscure that wasn&#39;t stocked at Lex&#39;eri. We got 
there just fine, but the return trip was the kinker.&quot; 

&quot;Little Q?&quot; Alex asked. 

&quot;Quartermaster V&#39;Lan,&quot; Maze explained. &quot;He&#39;s about six feet tall, 
which is considered imposing for an avian. His older sister Thorn is 
also a Dragoon, and everyone calls her Big Q despite her being shorter 
than Ra&#39;vel.&quot; 

Ra&#39;vel chirped in mild amusement and Tolaris raised an eyebrow. &quot;I can 
understand why V&#39;Lan was along, but why D&#39;Nina?&quot; 

The purple-haired Dragoon snickered. &quot;What, you think anyone in their 
right mind would let Asrial drive a scout cruiser? D&#39;Nina was the 
pilot for that trip. Which probably explains why we were able to 
casually walk away from a decidedly hard landing with only minor 
bruises on our backsides and a dire need for a new coat of paint on 
the underside of the cruiser.&quot; 

Susan tilted her head slightly to one side as Tolaris grunted in faint 
amusement. &quot;Can I ask how that little adventure was resolved?&quot; 

Maze smirked. &quot;Funny you should mention that,&quot; he said with a grin. 
&quot;We had the amazing luck to land near a repair facility called Sector 
Seven. They mostly worked on surface vehicles, but they managed to 
scrounge up a compatible type of gravity shield that we could use. 
Friendly bunch, too....&quot; 

Tolaris sighed quietly. &quot;I can tell by your tone that you don&#39;t mean 
they were friendly in the conventional sense,&quot; he said guardedly. 

&quot;Well...&quot; Maze replied as he leaned back in the chair and put his arms 
behind his head. &quot;Let&#39;s just say that this one mechanic named Mint was 
quite glad to see someone like me. Dark green hair, probably two 
shades lighter than Susan&#39;s hair, with a natural skin-color to match, 
but she had this amazing ability to change the color of her skin. Like 
Dyvach, really, but she could also become nearly invisible. Quite 
amusing....&quot; 

Both Whisper and Ra&#39;vel rolled their eyes in unison, and Tolaris just 
shook his head. &quot;Thank you, Lieutenant, we get the picture,&quot; he said 
dourly. 

&quot;I keep telling people it&#39;s the hair color,&quot; Alex muttered, drawing an 
unamused look from Susan and an embarassed blush from Michelle. A very 
odd liquid sound filled the air, causing everyone to blink in surprise 
and turn around in unison to look. 

Dyvach was leaning over the mirror and was pouring some sort of 
silvery liquid in the gap where the glass used to be. A faint gurgle 
erupted from its mouth as another stream of liquid was expelled, 
adding to the strange pool of shiny metallic liquid. 

&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I needed to see that,&quot; Alex said as she 
wrinkled her nose in disgust. Michelle just whimpered quietly as the 
weaver continued to make strange horking sounds. 

&quot;What did you expect?&quot; Susan said as she studied the process with rapt 
interest. &quot;I&#39;m curious, Dyvach.... will that harden on its own or will 
you need to use a catalyst to make that solidify?&quot; 

The response from the weaver was to inhale deeply and light a match. 
The resulting burst of flammable gas that it vented was sufficiently 
hot enough to boil the metallic liquid, the heat turing the air around 
it into a shimmering curtain. The flame persisted for a few more 
seconds before it vanished and the residual heat allowed to dissipate. 

&quot;Is that a good enough answer for you, Sue?&quot; Alex said as she cringed 
from the wave of heat that drifted over to the table. She darted 
upright as an icy blast of wind blew across the table, raising 
goosebumps on her arms. &quot;Holy crap, that was cold! What happened?&quot; she 
said with a shiver. 

Everyone suddenly turned to look at Tolaris as he lowered his hand. 
&quot;That was just a bit on the warm side, Dyvach,&quot; he chided the weaver. 

Alex gave the Dragoon a piercing look. &quot;What was that?&quot; she demanded. 

Whisper cleared her throat quietly. &quot;I told you that he can control 
the weather,&quot; she said gently. &quot;That includes decidedly icy breezes.&quot; 

&quot;Would you prefer I let the heat get close enough to boil the wine?&quot; 

&quot;Not at all, Commander, I was just stating a simple fact.&quot; 

Alex just shook her head. &quot;I just love this place, always full of new 
and fun surprises. Oh, hell.... Dyvach, what are you doing now?&quot; 

Dyvach made a slightly irritated chime at her as it started to coat 
the tips of its legs with a slightly coarse lubricant. Tolaris nodded 
and turned to Alex. &quot;Dyvach said that the glass has inherent 
imperfections from the reforging process and it will have to grind the 
glass to a reflective polish.&quot; 

&quot;As is the case with all industrially-produced glass,&quot; Susan added. 
&quot;I&#39;m quite surprised the process only took this long to complete. 
Usually it takes a master craftsman several hours from start to 
finish.&quot; 

&quot;Huh,&quot; Alex said noncommittally as a muted grinding noise filled the 
air. &quot;So I take it Dyvach is really handy to have around?&quot; 

All four of the denizens nodded. &quot;You have no idea,&quot; Maze replied. &quot;If 
it wasn&#39;t for Dyvach&#39;s help, we would probably have been in some very 
serious trouble during the time the Sailor Scouts were in the 
Negaverse with Tolaris.&quot; 

Susan raised an eyebrow. &quot;How long is the full story?&quot; she inquired. 

Alex smirked. &quot;You&#39;ll have to forgive her,&quot; she said lightly. &quot;Since 
she doesn&#39;t sleep like the rest of us, she has a lot of time on her 
hands and does odd things to keep herself amused. Like paint a 
portrait of something at three in the morning or collect stories to 
tell to other people during after-dinner gatherings.&quot; 

There was a slight pause from everyone else. &quot;And that&#39;s a bad thing 
to do because...?&quot; Maze prompted. 

&quot;Nevermind,&quot; the blonde said with a sigh. 

&quot;Probably several hours from start to finish,&quot; Tolaris told Susan. &quot;It 
most likely would take an entire evening to relate it all.&quot; 

&quot;Especially if you have everyone adding their individual points of 
view,&quot; Whisper added. 

Susan smiled gently. &quot;I have the time to listen if you have the desire 
to talk about it,&quot; she offered. 

Whisper rubbed the bridge of her nose as she gave up on her current 
train of thought and shoved it onto a back burner. &quot;Speaking loosely 
of which, I remember your little recording gem from awhile ago, and I 
know you are a bit of a time-traveller. Are you a historian, by 
chance?&quot; 

&quot;Chronologist,&quot; Susan corrected. &quot;History is the study of the past, 
but what I study and observe happens throughout time. Past, present, 
and future.&quot; 

&quot;Which of course she can&#39;t reveal to us for fear of contaminating the 
events of the future,&quot; Alex muttered darkly. 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;That makes a bit of sense. I&#39;m not sure how you 
avoid temporal paradoxes when you time-travel, but that&#39;s probably a 
bit above my capability for understanding.&quot; 

&quot;Not at all, Commander,&quot; Susan said with a tilt of her head. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
I can sit down and explain it to you one night in such a way that a 
man of your level of intelligence can reasonably comprehend.&quot; 

There was a slightly awkward pause as Tolaris tried to determine if 
that was a subtle insult or not. &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; he said neutrally. 

Dyvach finished polishing the mirror and held it up to the light with 
a triumphant chime. It checked the reflection from several angles 
before it cooed with satisfaction and skittered over to the table, 
holding out the newly repaired mirror to Michelle. 

&quot;Ooo, thank you!&quot; she said, her eyes wide with delight. She seemed to 
be momentarily oblivious to the fact that a giant spider was six 
inches away from her as she accepted the Soul Mirror. 

&quot;Not bad for a spider,&quot; Alex said as she peered over Michelle&#39;s 
shoulder to look at the reflective surface. 

&quot;Alex, be nice,&quot; Susan chided her before turning to the weaver. &quot;Thank 
you for your help, Dyvach,&quot; she said, drawing a happy chime in 
response. 

Michelle closed her eyes and concentrated for a moment, trying to 
focus the powers of the mirror. The glass surface seemed to ripple 
slightly in the light, as if it were a pool of still water stirred by 
a breeze. &quot;It feels normal to me,&quot; she said with a joyful grin as she 
opened her eyes. 

Susan nodded. &quot;We&#39;ll have to test it later, of course, but for the 
moment it seems that all is as it should be.&quot; 

&quot;So what does it do?&quot; Maze asked as he leaned forward on his elbows. 

Michelle cast a slightly uncertain look at Susan, taking a deep breath 
when she got a nod in return. &quot;My Soul Mirror is capable of reflecting 
almost any sort of focused energy,&quot; she said cautiously. &quot;It can also 
show a person&#39;s true nature to someone if you look hard enough.&quot; 

&quot;That could be useful,&quot; Maze commented as Ra&#39;vel chirped in agreement. 

&quot;Hmm....&quot; Alex said as she looked at Myst. &quot;Hey, kitty, c&#39;mere for a 
moment, I want to see something.&quot; 

Susan blinked. &quot;Actually, Alex, that would probably be a bad idea.&quot; 

&quot;Huh?&quot; the blonde blinked in confusion. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

&quot;This isn&#39;t Myst&#39;s true form,&quot; Susan explained as she brushed her 
fingers across Myst&#39;s silky gray fur. 

&quot;I know that,&quot; Alex said as she blew her breath out through her 
nostrils. &quot;That&#39;s why I want to see what she looks like in the 
mirror.&quot; 

Susan just shook her head. &quot;And that&#39;s the bad part. You remember what 
you saw when you were drying her off after we pulled her out of the 
lake?&quot; 

Eyebrows were raised around the table as Alex chewed on her lower lip. 
&quot;I really was&#39;t sure what I saw,&quot; she finally said after a moment of 
silence. 

Myst flicked her ears back. &quot;I&#39;m told that my natural form is 
terrifying to humans,&quot; she said as her tail lashed back and forth. 

Blue eyes met pale red eyes for a moment before Alex finally blinked 
and glanced away from the Shinma. &quot;Okay, we&#39;ll skip this one, then,&quot; 
she muttered. 

Whisper continued to study the ornate mirror. &quot;You said it could 
deflect focused energy attacks, right?&quot; she asked Michelle. 

&quot;It should, if it was repaired right,&quot; she replied hesitantly. 

Whisper thought for another few seconds. &quot;And you said you would have 
it reforged elsewhere if Dyvach didn&#39;t do the repair correctly, 
right?&quot; 

&quot;Most assuredly,&quot; Susan said in a dry tone. 

&quot;Do you think it can deflect a psi-spike focused on physical matter?&quot; 

Michelle blinked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; 

Whisper pointed at her wineglass. &quot;I can use a telekinetic shockwave, 
as it were, to shatter this glass using psi-energy instead of 
agitating the air or the physical structure of the glass. I was 
wondering if you would be able to deflect something like that, or if 
that would crack the mirror&#39;s glass.&quot; 

Alex shot her an odd look. &quot;She just had it replaced, and you want to 
see if you can break it?&quot; she said slowly. 

The telepath shrugged. &quot;Susan said it needed testing, and I just 
thought it would be a simple and easy thing to do, that&#39;s all.&quot; 

Susan and Michelle exchanged glances for several seconds before Susan 
gave her a slow nod. &quot;If I understand her correctly, it should indeed 
be quite able to reflect such an energy burst,&quot; Susan said slowly. 
&quot;And if not, or if the mirror fails, I can still have it taken to the 
Hellforge in the morning. It&#39;s up to you, Michelle.&quot; 

&quot;This should be fun,&quot; Alex muttered to herself. 

Michelle blinked and gave Whisper a very uncertain look. &quot;How strong 
is this test going to be?&quot; she ventured. 

&quot;Strong enough to crack a wineglass, but not strong enough to shatter 
it,&quot; Whisper replied. &quot;At least, it shouldn&#39;t shatter it,&quot; she added. 

Maze smirked. &quot;Time to see if your mirror is all that it&#39;s cracked up 
to be?&quot; he suggested, drawing groans from everyone else. 

Whisper gave him a partially amused look. &quot;I should spike you again 
just for that one,&quot; she said languidly. 

Tolaris shook his head. &quot;I think you&#39;ve injured my lieutenant enough 
for one day, Captain. Save it for something truly deserving. And no, 
you can&#39;t spike him either,&quot; he added as Ra&#39;vel gave him a wicked 
chirp. 

&quot;Can I at least aim for his wineglass?&quot; Whisper muttered. 

The Dragoon commander chuckled. &quot;Sure, but you get to clean up any 
mess it makes,&quot; he cautioned her. 

Michelle gave Alex an uncertain look as she gripped her mirror 
tightly, the surface momentarily rippling again in the light. The 
blonde leaned over and kissed her cheek. &quot;I say give it a shot, love. 
Worst that can happen is we need a dustpan for the fragments and Sue 
fixes it tomorrow.&quot; 

&quot;Okay,&quot; Michelle said nervously as she adjusted her grip on the mirror 
and held it up facing Whisper, angling the mirror so that any 
reflection would be in Maze&#39;s general direction. 

&quot;Put your shield up, Maze, just in case I have bad aim,&quot; Whisper said 
as she steepled her fingertips and concentrated. An infinitesimal 
disturbance was created in the air in front of her and darted forward, 
leaving a very slight visual wake in its path. There was a slight 
pinging noise as the disturbance bounced off of the surface of the 
mirror, causing it to ripple like a pool of water after a stone had 
been thrown in. The spark of psi-energy continued on a new course 
until it impacted in the center of Maze&#39;s wineglass, causing a small 
crack to form with a soft snap. 

&quot;Bull&#39;s-eye!&quot; Alex cheered as everyone looked at the cracked 
wineglass. 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Maze said dryly as the barrier around him faded away. 

&quot;You could always let Dyvach repair it,&quot; Whisper suggested lightly. 

&quot;Thank you, Captain, I don&#39;t know what I would do without you.&quot; 

&quot;Probably be relatively headache-free,&quot; Alex muttered as she rubbed 
her temples at the memory of her own experience with a psi-spike. 

Whisper chuckled quietly. &quot;I don&#39;t spike him that often.&quot; 

&quot;Once is enough,&quot; Maze muttered. 

Ra&#39;vel clicked her beak several times before chittering a question. 
There was a brief pause from the other denizens before they all 
glanced at the clock hanging on the wall outside the kitchen. &quot;Yeah, 
you&#39;re right,&quot; Maze replied. 

Alex blinked and glanced over her shoulder. &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; 

&quot;Almost time for the others to get out of school,&quot; Tolaris said. 

The blonde blinked and exchanged glances with Susan and Alex. &quot;Okay, 
so things are going to get even more interesting soon. Don&#39;t give me 
that look, Chancellor, you know I&#39;m not going to create a riot or 
anything.&quot; 

&quot;It&#39;s not you I&#39;m worried about,&quot; Susan said quietly. &quot;Perhaps you and 
Michelle should go take a shower and get dressed in something a bit 
more formal. This is the Crown Princess of the Moon we&#39;re meeting, and 
since she doesn&#39;t remember aything about us, this would be an 
excellent opportunity to make a respectable first impression.&quot; 

&quot;Far too late,&quot; Maze muttered with a smirk, drawing a look from 
Tolaris. 

Alex chuckled quietly. &quot;You&#39;re no prize yourself, you know.&quot; 

The denizen smiled and leaned back in his chair. &quot;So what&#39;s the 
problem? At least we have a very hospitable understanding, right? 
Nobody&#39;s perfect.&quot; 

Alex paused for a moment to consider that. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right,&quot; 
she said slowly. &quot;Still doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;d trust you any farther than I 
can throw you,&quot; she said without any rancor. 

&quot;Alex!&quot; Susan said sharply. 

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Whisper said casually, &quot;Maze is such a lightweight, 
and I&#39;ve seen your sword arm. You might actually be able to toss him 
for a rather respectable distance.&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; Maze protested as Ra&#39;vel erupted into a cackle of laughter. 

&quot;Anytime, anyplace,&quot; Alex said as she flexed her muscles. 

Both Tolaris and Susan put their heads in their hands at the same 
moment, each unaware of what the other was doing. &quot;Kids, play nice,&quot; 
the Dragoon said with a heavy sigh. 

Michelle gently took Alex&#39;s arm. &quot;Come on,&quot; she said softly. 

&quot;Yeah, yeah, whatever,&quot; the blonde grumbled as she was led away. 

Both Whisper and Ra&#39;vel stood up from the table. &quot;Guess what, Maze?&quot; 

Maze just sighed. &quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; he said, unconsciously mimicking Alex. 
&quot;I get to clean the table, right?&quot; 

&quot;Good boy, Lieutenant, the Dragoons have trained you well.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you, ma&#39;am, we live to serve,&quot; he replied dryly. 

Tolaris and Susan lifted their heads up to trade looks. &quot;Cue the cat,&quot; 
Susan said almost inaudibly. 

&quot;You people are strange,&quot; Myst said as she preened her whiskers, 
totally unaware of what Susan just said. 

Tolaris smiled at the succubus. &quot;I like your style.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you. I think that, all tensions aside, we might actually be 
able to become decent friends.&quot; 

&quot;Was there really that much doubt?&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;d be surprised, Commander.&quot; 

&quot;That bad, hmm?&quot; 

&quot;Picture your own world destroyed by an alien species, then see just 
how easy it is for you to put the recent past behind you,&quot; she 
suggested. 

&quot;It&#39;s only recent from your perspective.&quot; 

&quot;If I&#39;m to make friends, isn&#39;t that what really counts?&quot; 

&quot;A valid point,&quot; he conceded. 

&quot;At least you seem reasonable, that&#39;s a good sign.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.... I think.&quot; 

Susan chuckled quietly. &quot;Cheer up, Commander, I think things are going 
to turn out reasonably well tonight.&quot; 

Tolaris shrugged. &quot;Let&#39;s hope so, I think we&#39;ve both had enough 
headaches for one day, and we&#39;re just on the proverbial sidelines.&quot; 

She smiled as she held up her nearly empty wineglass. &quot;Here&#39;s to 
that.&quot;
