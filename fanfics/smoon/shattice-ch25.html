<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch24.html">Back to Part 24</a><pre>Setsuna bent forward and Ami blinked in surprise as
those lips softly touched hers. It was a tentative
kiss, almost chaste, then the older woman drew back a
bit. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Setsuna smiled, her green tinted
black hair shimmering.

&quot;Nothing to be sorry for,&quot; Ami managed after a moment.
She smiled shyly, &quot;I&#39;ve been thinking of doing
something like that, too.&quot;

&quot;You might have told me sooner,&quot; Setsuna&#39;s voice was
faintly teasing as a unexpected tension left her body.

Ami smiled back, the scar across her face more visible
because of her blush, &quot;It&#39;s been pretty hectic
lately.&quot;

&quot;True enough,&quot; Setsuna agreed, reaching out to take
her hand. &quot;Are you all right with this?&quot; she asked
gently.

&quot;I said I wanted to kiss you, too,&quot; Ami reminded her.
Both women smiled as they gazed at each other then Ami
sighed, &quot;And as much as I&#39;d like to do...other things,
I have Chibi-Usa to worry about.&quot;

&quot;And if I don&#39;t head back home soon I&#39;m going to be
teased to death by Haruka and Michiru,&quot; Setsuna
admitted.

Ami got up from the table and followed Setsuna over to
the door. &quot;Do you want me to walk you home?&quot; Ami
offered.

Setsuna shook her head, &quot;I think I&#39;ll transform once I
go outside... I can get home in minutes that way.&quot;

&quot;Be careful,&quot; Ami squeezed her hand before reluctantly
letting it go.

&quot;Always,&quot; and with that Setsuna was gone.

Ami stretched, yawning slightly then went down the
hall to Chibi-Usa&#39;s bedroom. The little pink haired
girl was in her pajamas already, the black cat Luna
watching sleepily as Ami entered. &quot;Ready for bed?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;Yes, Ami-papa,&quot; Chibi-Usa agreed as she climbed in
bed.

&quot;Sleep tight,&quot; Ami kissed her cheek.

&quot;Ami?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Ami turned from where she stood in the doorway.

&quot;Are you and Setsuna like Haruka and Michiru?&quot;
Chibi-Usa asked innocently.

Ami felt herself blush. &quot;Why do you ask?&quot; she managed
casually.

&quot;Because Hotaru seems so happy with her Haruka-papa
and Michiru-mama,&quot; Chibi-Usa explained, &quot;I thought
it&#39;d be nice if we were like that.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; Ami said as she slipped out.

Meanwhile, in a pricey townhouse apartment music rang
out as the band practiced. &quot;Not a bad love song,&quot;
Taiki admitted, his reddish brown hair falling in a
neat ponytail. Despite all the energy they put out
practicing he still looked neat, too, in his t-shirt
and dress pants.

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Seiya nodded, getting the guitar down. He
looked rougher around the edges than Taiki did, his
jeans and t-shirt rumpled.

&quot;Is it all the unrequited interest in Miss Mizuno
talking?&quot; Yaten teased, the smaller, white haired boy
stepping away from the keyboard.

&quot;No, it is not,&quot; Seiya said with as much dignity as he
could muster.

&quot;Then why did you want me to compile a dossier on Miss
Mizuno?&quot; Taiki said with a straight face, picking up
the papers from a nearby desk.

&quot;Just curious,&quot; Seiya quickly got up and took the
papers from him.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Taiki hid a smile.

&quot;Let&#39;s see.. Were not that far apart in age,&quot; Seiya
noted aloud as he read, &quot;3.95 GPA?!&quot;

&quot;Damn,&quot; Yaten whistled.

&quot;She only lost the .05 over a dispute with the
philosophy professor,&quot; Taiki revealed, &quot;it was quite
the scandal in the science clubs.&quot;

&quot;Nerds stick together?&quot; Yaten guessed.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Taiki nodded seriously, &quot;but call us &#145;socially
challenged intellectuals&#39;, please. Nerd is so passe.&quot;

Seiya rolled his eyes. &quot;Couple teachers have noted
concerns with her socializing,&quot; he noted, &quot;or lack
there of.&quot;

&quot;Considering the tragedy in her life, I&#39;m not
surprised,&quot; Taiki said dryly. As Seiya flipped through
the report questioningly he said, &quot;Last sheet, I
printed up the news article.&quot;

Seiya read the headline &#145;Slaughter in Tokyo&#39; and his
face went grim. Five young people slain gruesomely, a
mysterious creature found in the rubble and a pair of
survivors, a little girl... and Ami Mizuno. Her photo
attached to the news report had ben taken then and she
looked haunted, wounded body and soul.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Yaten murmured, reading over Seiya&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I think we all know how that feels,&quot; Seiya admitted.
All three of them had known pain and loss, more than
they cared to admit. &quot;Her teachers are fools if they
think Ami&#39;d just bounce back after that.&quot;

&quot;And according to rumors I&#39;ve gathered Ami wasn&#39;t too
sociable even before this,&quot; Taiki nodded. He gave
Seiya a serious look, &quot;If you intend to even be a
friend to her, you&#39;re going to have to go slow and
easy.&quot;

&quot;Something our fearless leader isn&#39;t too good at,&quot;
Yaten pointed out.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Seiya tossed a piece of balled up paper
at him.

Yaten ducked, sticking out his tongue. &quot;You know it&#39;s
true,&quot; he said seriously.

&quot;Yeah, I guess so,&quot; Seiya conceded that point. He got
up, pacing the room, &quot;And then there&#39;s Sailor
Mercury.&quot;

&quot;She remains a mystery,&quot; Taiki acknowledged.

&quot;I don&#39;t trust them,&quot; Yaten scowled.

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t go that far,&quot; Seiya smiled faintly. There
was something unexplainedly familiar about Sailor
Mercury, but for the life of her she couldn&#39;t figure
out what. &quot;What I&#39;d really like to know is,&quot; he
continued, &quot;how is it she can heal Phages?&quot;

&quot;Our leader was looking for the legendary Sailor
Scout,&quot; Taiki offered tentatively, &quot;could that somehow
be Sailor Mercury?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s too young,&quot; Yaten protested.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Seiya looked thoughtful as he mused, &quot;or
maybe she&#39;s the legendary Sailor Scout...reborn
somehow?&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Yaten blurted, eyes wide.

&quot;Maybe, maybe not,&quot; Taiki said thoughtfully, &quot;but no
matter what happens, it means we need to keep a close
eye on her.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Seiya nodded seriously.

&quot;You&#39;ll just have to make sure Mercury surveillance
doesn&#39;t cut into your attempts to seduce Ami,&quot; Yaten
smirked.

&quot;Would you drop that?&quot; Seiya scowled.

Yaten just laughed.</pre>
