<h1>Dark Skies, Bright Heavens (part 11 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immora.html">Immora</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkbrite-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Haruka wasn&#39;t too surprised when she woke up and found Michiru sitting 
in a chair next to her bed. She rubbed her eyes and yawned a bit, taking 
a few moments to stretch, and grinned at Michiru. &quot;I really like waking 
up with you here.&quot;

Michiru laughed and sat down on the bed next to Haruka. &quot;I couldn&#39;t wait 
to see you again,&quot; she said, &quot;but I got so distracted just watching you 
that I didn&#39;t make you breakfast like yesterday.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s okay,&quot; Haruka said, reaching up to take hold of Michiru&#39;s 
shoulders. &quot;I&#39;d like to go out somewhere for breakfast anyway. Not that 
I don&#39;t like your cooking,&quot; she amended quickly, &quot;but I think it would 
be nice.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think you meant it as an insult,&quot; Michiru said, taking hold of 
Haruka&#39;s hands. &quot;And I&#39;d like that.&quot;

&quot;Good,&quot; Haruka whispered. She pulled Michiru down onto her and kissed 
her gently. &quot;I&#39;ll get ready.&quot;

&quot;That can wait,&quot; Michiru murmured, her hands pressed to the pillow on 
either side of Haruka&#39;s face. She kissed her briefly, smiling at her. 
&quot;I&#39;m enjoying your company.&quot;

&quot;My company, huh?&quot; Haruka laughed, trailing a finger across Michiru&#39;s 
jaw. She pressed her lips to Michiru&#39;s cheek. &quot;If that&#39;s what you want 
to call it.&quot;

&quot;Silly.&quot; Michiru&#39;s sighed and lay her head against the crook of Haruka&#39;s 
neck. Haruka wrapped her arms around her shoulders and smiled sweetly at 
her. They lay holding each other for several minutes, not saying a word. 
Michiru finally sat up and pulled Haruka up with her. &quot;Well, we should 
go have breakfast then.&quot;

Haruka quickly showered and dressed, then drove them to a nice 
restaurant for breakfast. She noted the sky was unusually dark. She 
couldn&#39;t tell if it was a thick storm cloud cover or something else.

They talked a bit while they were eating. Michiru was in mid-sentence 
when her eyes suddenly glazed over and she went limp. Haruka was quickly 
out of her seat, rushing to support Michiru.

&quot;Michiru?! What happened?!&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know...&quot; Michiru carefully sat up and looked out the 
window with a gasp. &quot;What is that?!&quot;

Haruka looked and also gasped in surprise when she saw what Michiru was 
looking at it.

A strange crystalline structure was nestled between some buildings. It 
shone black and gave off an eerie light. It seemed to be getting larger 
by the moment.

&quot;That explains the lack of traffic,&quot; Haruka whispered. &quot;I couldn&#39;t see 
it from my building... But... what the hell--?&quot;

The sky seemed to grow darker and lightning shot through the air. Haruka 
backed away from the window and drew Michiru back with her.

&quot;You had some sort of reaction, was it that... thing?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Michiru whispered. &quot;I just... I suddenly felt a deep 
chill, like something wrong was happening. It&#39;s not the same as when the 
daimon appear.&quot;

&quot;Well, we shouldn&#39;t get involved,&quot; Haruka said, her mouth creased into a 
frown.

&quot;Why not?&quot;

&quot;We already have a mission, Michiru, a very important one. If we go 
racing off to stop that... thing... and something happens to us, what 
happens to our mission?&quot;

&quot;... True...&quot; Michiru admitted. &quot;But what if people get hurt and killed 
because of that thing?&quot;

&quot;The Inner Senshi were awakened, right? They&#39;ll take care of it. If it 
was really serious, we would feel a pull to it.&quot;

&quot;I just can&#39;t stand the thought that there might be something we could 
do,&quot; Michiru sighed. &quot;But... you&#39;re right.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, now we better hurry and finish breakfast. I want to get away from 
here, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Michiru teased.

They started hurrying to finish their meal, and were surprised when a 
shadow fell over them.

&quot;Hello, Haruka-san, Michiru-san.&quot; 

Haruka jumped a bit in surprise as she saw Setsuna standing there, 
looking even more serious than usual. &quot;Setsuna-san, I thought your 
post--&quot;

&quot;This is important. I have to tell you while I can; I will have to 
remain at my post for quite a long time after this.&quot;

&quot;Set--&quot;

&quot;Let me speak. There is very suspicious activity going on at a school 
around here... Mugen Gakuen. You will transfer there and keep an eye on 
their activity.&quot;

&quot;Um, Setsuna-san,&quot; Haruka said, &quot;in case you forgot, I _just_ switched 
to my school...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Setsuna said. &quot;But this is very important. There&#39;s a dark 
energy gathering there... you _must_ go there.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sure my parents won&#39;t mind... it&#39;s a very new school, right? Many 
top scoring students go there... But all the paperwork--&quot;

&quot;Done.&quot; Setsuna almost smiled. &quot;I&#39;ve already arranged all of it. Your 
parents can afford it, Michiru-san, and Haruka-san, you won&#39;t have 
trouble with all the money you earn racing.&quot;

&quot;But--&quot; Haruka tried to interrupt but Setsuna quieted her.

&quot;I don&#39;t have time,&quot; Setsuna said. &quot;You start Monday. I&#39;m very sorry to 
be so abrupt but this is our last chance to arrange it.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright, Setsuna-san,&quot; Michiru said. &quot;It&#39;s our duty.&quot;

Setsuna nodded and placed a package on the table. &quot;Your uniforms... I 
must leave now.&quot;

&quot;Go on,&quot; Michiru said.

&quot;Good luck.&quot; Setsuna bowed slightly and left.

&quot;That was very weird...&quot; Haruka said, staring after Setsuna. &quot;She just 
pops in out of nowhere, and suddenly we&#39;re changing schools? What a 
weird day.&quot;

&quot;Very,&quot; Michiru said with a chuckle, opening the package. She 
instinctively pushed it back slightly when she saw the uniforms.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I... I don&#39;t know... maybe it has something to do with what Setsuna-san 
said...&quot; Michiru looked at the uniform. &quot;I&#39;ve seen this before... the 
boy at the track...&quot;

&quot;The one the daimon possessed,&quot; Haruka said, her lips compressing into a 
line. She pulled out her uniform. It had a crisp white dress shirt, a 
dark red jacket, muted green shirt and tie with a matching plaid 
pattern, and a brown belt. Over the left breast pocket was a black star 
with a gold infinity symbol sewn into it, and underneath the star, a 
small black strip reading &quot;Mugen.&quot; &quot;The very same uniform.&quot;

Michiru nodded, pulling hers out. &quot;I haven&#39;t seen the girls&#39; uniform... 
hmm, this is pretty nice...&quot; The dark red shirt had long sleeves with 
thick black cuffs, the waist trimmed in a small border of green and 
black stripes, with a dark blue collar and a muted green bow with black 
stripes coming off of it. The fabric of the shirt peeping out of the 
collar had a black star on it. The muted green skirt fell to her knees 
and had a plaid pattern. Michiru held the shirt up against her. &quot;Does 
this color look alright with my hair?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine, Michiru.&quot;

&quot;What are we going to tell our parents?&quot; Michiru said. &quot;Out of nowhere, 
we&#39;re changing schools... and it&#39;s almost the end of the year.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell my mom it&#39;s closer to my apartment,&quot; Haruka said with a 
shrug. &quot;If you tell your parents how good that school is... I don&#39;t 
think they&#39;d approve of you changing just to be with me, right?&quot;

&quot;Doubtful.&quot; Michiru said with a sigh. &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out later... 
right now, I want to get away from that crystal thing.&quot;



&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been to the ocean,&quot; Haruka said, looking out 
over the water after parking the car.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe it!&quot; Michiru laughed at her. &quot;It takes someone 
attacking Tokyo to get you to go to the beach...&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever come here at all if you didn&#39;t ask me,&quot; Haruka 
said. &quot;What&#39;s so great about it?&quot;

Michiru sighed deeply. &quot;I would think you&#39;d understand. As close as the 
wind and sea are, you should.&quot;

&quot;Maybe if it was summer instead of winter, I could appreciate it,&quot; 
Haruka said. &quot;January isn&#39;t exactly beach-going weather.&quot;

Michiru laughed and planted a gentle kiss on her cheek. &quot;We&#39;ll have to 
get back out here in July then. I can&#39;t wait to swim in the ocean again 
instead of a pool.&quot;

&quot;And get me into a swimsuit?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes twinkled. &quot;You read my mind.&quot;

They cuddled together for awhile, resting their cheeks together. Michiru 
was thrilled to finally be back at the ocean. She wished it wasn&#39;t so 
cold so she could swim.

&quot;Hmmm, your birthday is coming up soon.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, so?&quot;

&quot;Fifteen...&quot; Michiru nestled her head against Haruka&#39;s neck. &quot;I&#39;ll have 
to make your birthday special.&quot; Haruka&#39;s eyes widened a bit nervously. 
Michiru laughed and said, &quot;We&#39;ll have a nice romantic dinner and a quiet 
evening at your apartment... What, did you think I was going to say 
something else?&quot;

&quot;Um... no...&quot; Haruka laughed nervously.

&quot;Sure,&quot; Michiru said, giggling as she bent her head to kiss Haruka&#39;s 
neck. &quot;Your mother won&#39;t expect you to spend the day with her, will 
she?&quot;

&quot;Dunno,&quot; Haruka breathed. She was too busy enjoying the kisses to bother 
with speaking. She gently kissed the top of Michiru&#39;s head and sighed.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Michiru whispered. She cupped Haruka&#39;s chin and kissed 
her. &quot;Promise me... we&#39;ll always be together...&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Haruka looked away. &quot;I want to... but... This mission could very 
well mean our deaths. If we make that promise...&quot;

Michiru sat in silent consideration. &quot;Haruka...&quot;

Haruka gently wrapped her arm around Michiru. &quot;As long as I&#39;m alive, 
I&#39;ll be with you, I promise you that. I just... if something happens to 
me, I don&#39;t want to feel like I broke my promise.&quot;

Michiru lay her head on Haruka&#39;s chest, eyes shimmering. &quot;Nothing will 
happen to you. I won&#39;t let anything happen to you. If it means my 
life--&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Haruka said sharply. &quot;I don&#39;t want you dying for me.&quot;

&quot;... All right... I promise.... For the sake of the mission... one of us 
has to live... We can&#39;t go risking our lives for each other...&quot;

&quot;I make the same promise,&quot; Haruka whispered, kissing her forehead. &quot;Now, 
for the moment, let&#39;s pretend that didn&#39;t happen and everything&#39;s all 
nice and happy again, hmmm?&quot;

Michiru smiled as Haruka kissed her shoulder. &quot;That sounds like a good 
idea.&quot;



&quot;What is it, Kaolinite-kun?&quot; a deep voiced man called.

&quot;There is an interference,&quot; she said, walking into the laboratory. She 
wore a white lab coat over her red dress. Her purple eyes were alight 
with anger. &quot;This &#39;Black Moon Clan&#39; that appeared is gathering up 
energy. It&#39;s temporarily interfering with the new daimons.&quot;

&quot;I thought I had finally perfected it,&quot; he muttered, lifting up two 
beakers. &quot;How are they interfering?&quot;

&quot;I haven&#39;t been able to locate targets. There&#39;s so much dark energy 
concentrated in the area thanks to their crystal that it&#39;s been hard to 
target the pureness of heart crystals.&quot;

He poured the contents of two beakers together. &quot;Very well... we will 
wait for this to pass...&quot; His brow furrowed and he turned to Kaolinite. 
&quot;The mistress wants us to speed up the daimon attacks. This is an 
unexpected delay. When this Black Moon Clan is gone, we will attack more 
than ever.&quot;

&quot;Professor...&quot; she paused and bowed her head. &quot;Until this new batch of 
daimons, we attacked everyday--&quot;

&quot;That was when we needed to use those inferior daimons,&quot; he interrupted. 
&quot;Now we have much better daimons that will be more likely to retrieve 
heart crystals.&quot;

&quot;Professor, if I might say so...&quot; she looked around to make sure no one 
else had entered the laboratory and stepped closer to him. &quot;I never 
thought this Sailorneptune to be a fierce opponent, but now there&#39;s a 
new Senshi with her. I don&#39;t know her name yet. I&#39;m becoming worried. If 
those other five Senshi survive battling the Black Moon Clan, they will 
be free to aide Sailorneptune and her partner in defeating our daimons. 
They might beat us to the Talismans. Sailorneptune was interested in 
examining the heart crystals.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; he growled. One of the beakers fell from his hands. &quot;Do they 
want the Talismans?!&quot; He clenched his fist as he looked out over the 
laboratory he&#39;d poured so much work into. &quot;We will defeat them,&quot; he said 
forcefully.

Kaolinite bowed respectfully to him. &quot;Your genius will lead us to 
success, Professor Tomoe.&quot;

&quot;Indeed.&quot; He turned away, a twisted grin marring his features. He threw 
his head back and laughed maniacally. &quot;Master Pharaoh 90 will find the 
world eagerly awaiting his arrival.&quot;

Kaolinite smirked in agreement. The pitiful humans of this world were no 
match against their master.

&quot;I will speak to the mistress. You may go.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; she said, bowing again. She disappeared, leaving her lab coat to 
fall to the floor.

Professor Tomoe went into the cellar area where a young girl sat on a 
throne, surrounded by piles of dolls and ornate lamps. Her black hair 
barely touched her narrow shoulders. Her eyes were cold and red against 
her face, hidden in shadows so that her features were undeterminable. 
She smiled as he approached. A microphone dangled near her, and though 
he could hear her electronic-sounding voice, her lips were not moving.

&quot;Do you have news for me?&quot; Her voice seemed all around him.

&quot;Yes, our Messiah of Silence,&quot; he said, lowering himself in homage. He 
told her what Kaolinite had said.

&quot;This cannot be allowed,&quot; she said, frowning. &quot;I need the energy of pure 
hearts. I need the Talismans to be found so we can have the Holy Grail.&quot;

&quot;I will make sure more daimons are employed,&quot; he said quickly. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, we will soon have the Holy Grail and the world will be Silenced.&quot;

&quot;It better be. Leave me.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Messiah.&quot;



Haruka and Michiru returned very late and found that things had returned 
to about as normal as they ever were. Haruka dropped off Michiru, 
promising to pick her up for school. Michiru smiled and kissed her 
goodbye. She took a deep breath as she started to go inside to face her 
parents.

&quot;Michiru-chan!&quot; Ki called. &quot;Come here right now!&quot;

Michiru&#39;s heart thumped as she walked to the living room. &quot;Yes, 
okaa-san?&quot;

Ki came and embraced her daughter. &quot;We received a phone call today from 
a very elite school-- Mugen Gakuen. Apparently they&#39;ve found out your 
academic reputation and your artistic talents, because they asked us to 
allow you to attend! They think you would be a wonderful addition! Isn&#39;t 
that great? You start tomorrow!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s... that&#39;s wonderful...&quot; Michiru inwardly breathed a sigh of 
relief that she didn&#39;t have to think of an excuse; Setsuna had some sort 
of connections that Michiru was grateful for. Then her anger started to 
build; her mother would have made an important decision like this 
without asking her if she would agree to it? &quot;Well, I better get some 
rest--&quot;

&quot;Oh, that package in your hands...&quot; Ki took it from her. &quot;The uniform? 
How did you--&quot;

&quot;It was sitting by the front door,&quot; Michiru lied. &quot;They must be pretty 
incredible, okaa-san, to deliver my uniform straight to me.&quot;

&quot;How wonderful!&quot; Ki murmured. &quot;Well, off to bed with you. You have a 
busy day tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Ah, yes, okaa-san. Good night.&quot;



**********



Just as she&#39;d promised, Haruka was right on time to pick up Michiru in 
the morning. Michiru rushed downstairs with her things and was about to 
head out the door when someone grabbed her shoulder.

&quot;Who is that?&quot; Suteki asked her in an icy voice, pointing out the window 
at Haruka. &quot;And what are you both doing in those uniforms?&quot;

Michiru panicked and tried to pull away from Suteki. Their parents were 
right in the next room; if Suteki said anything...

&quot;Suteki-chan!&quot; Kanzen called. &quot;Suteki-chan, get in here right now!&quot;

Suteki grudgingly let go and went to see her big brother. Michiru 
breathed a sigh of relief at Kanzen&#39;s intervention and went outside to 
where Haruka was waiting.

&quot;Sorry, Suteki tried to make trouble,&quot; she said as she sat down.

&quot;That&#39;s all right. We lost a little time to push our way through the 
inevitable crowds of fans, but I think we can manage.&quot;

&quot;What makes you think there will be a crowd?&quot;

&quot;I think when they realize they have two famous people walking the 
hallways, they will go wild.&quot;

Michiru groaned a bit. &quot;I&#39;m really not in the mood for shoving my way 
through to our classes on our first day there. I guess we&#39;ll have to try 
and deal with it, huh?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll have to fight through the crowds of girls surrounding me, trying 
to get me to date them. But hey, at least we&#39;ll be doing it together,&quot; 
Haruka said with a wink.

&quot;Very funny.&quot;

Haruka laughed and continued driving. &quot;Well, we better get used to it. 
Everyone&#39;s going to be going nuts about us.&quot;

&quot;What a bother,&quot; Michiru groaned.

Haruka parked the car and they got their things out of the trunk. They 
walked into the school, amazed at it.

The school was an enormous skyscraper, with glass panes, elevators, 
snack machines, a few cafeterias, a large courtyard, gardens, fountains, 
with incredible sports facilities, an auditorium, an enormous library, 
science laboratories, and more that they couldn&#39;t see.

And this was the place Setsuna said was swarming with dark energy.

They barely had time to register their surroundings when a swarm of 
girls surrounded them.

&quot;Oh my gosh it&#39;s really them!&quot; &quot;Oh Haruka-kun! I&#39;ve gone to all your 
races!&quot; &quot;You&#39;re dating HER now?!&quot; &quot;Haruka-kun, why don&#39;t you go out with 
me?! I gave you my phone number at the last three races!&quot; &quot;How could you 
go behind our backs and someone?!&quot; &quot;Oh, Michiru-san, you&#39;re so lucky to 
be dating him!&quot; &quot;What&#39;s his kiss like?!&quot; &quot;Haruka-saaaan!&quot;

Michiru pressed her hand against her forehead. &quot;I think I&#39;m going to 
have a headache when this is over...&quot;

Haruka lightly grabbed her arm and tried to push through the crowd of 
girls who didn&#39;t want to budge. She finally glared at them and they 
backed off. She rushed Michiru to the elevator and hit the close door 
button before any of the girls decided they wanted to join them. Haruka 
consulted their identical schedules and pressed the button for the floor 
of their first class.

&quot;Well... I warned you...&quot; Haruka groaned. &quot;I have to admit, I didn&#39;t 
think it would be _that_ bad!&quot;

&quot;Your fans are just a tad obsessive,&quot; Michiru said.

&quot;Just a tad,&quot; Haruka remarked, grinning at her. &quot;Ha ha, &#39;What&#39;s his kiss 
like?&#39; Michiru?&quot;

Michiru laughed and winked at her. &quot;Quite good, actually.&quot; She bent to 
kiss Haruka, but stopped when the elevator doors started sliding open. 
She coughed slightly and stepped back to let the new passenger on. The 
young girl got on the elevator without saying a word to them. Michiru 
looked at her quizzically, but the girl kept her eyes fixed on the 
elevator doors.

Haruka looked around the elevator, eyeing the typical safety information 
that was posted and some school notices. A brief article caught her eye. 
It was about the man who owned and had established the school, a noticed 
genetic engineer named Tomoe Souichi. He was also a professor at the 
school. Haruka felt a sense of unease when she read over the article. 
For some reason, a nagging sensation grew in her mind when she saw the 
article.

&quot;Michiru, look at this,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;It&#39;s about the founder and 
owner of the school, Tomoe Souichi.&quot;

Michiru seemed to involuntarily flinch at the name, and the girl let out 
a tiny gasp that she tried to muffle. Haruka looked at her with some 
confusion.

&quot;Is something wrong, miss?&quot;

Now that she was paying attention, the girl seemed sickly. She looked 
small for her age, very thin, with pale skin and black hair. Her purple 
eyes seemed lifeless. She avoided Haruka&#39;s gaze and kept silent. The 
elevator stopped on another floor and she quickly got off.

&quot;Odd,&quot; Michiru said softly, turning her attention to the article. &quot;It 
has a brief mention of an accident that he and his daughter miraculously 
survived, but there&#39;s no other information about it. And his wife died 
several years ago in a fire.&quot;

&quot;Very unfortunate...&quot;

&quot;Wait a moment. Look at this picture of his daughter... She looks just 
like that girl that just left.&quot;

&quot;Think it&#39;s the same girl?&quot;

&quot;I think so... that would explain why she reacted to the mention of the 
professor&#39;s name...&quot;

&quot;Michiru, I have a very bad feeling, and I don&#39;t know why.&quot;

&quot;I do, too. Maybe this Tomoe has something to do with the attacks?&quot;

&quot;A mad scientist?&quot; Haruka joked. &quot;Maybe we&#39;re just too jumpy about all 
this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; Michiru said with a light laugh. They reached 
their floor finally and got off to walk to their classroom. They weren&#39;t 
too surprised when their female classmates tried to block their way.

&quot;Haruka-san, we heard from downstairs that you are coming to our school 
now! We are VERY glad to have you, but we aren&#39;t letting you in until we 
get answers,&quot; one of them said in a forceful tone. &quot;As your loyal fans, 
we need to know what this girl means to you!&quot;

&quot;But your delusions of love will end if I tell you,&quot; Haruka said with a 
wink.

&quot;We deserve to know! Michiru-san, is he your boyfriend?!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Michiru said, eyes twinkling in amusement. After all, it was the 
truth.

The girls started screaming and hugging each other. &quot;We still have a 
chance, we still have a chance!&quot;

Haruka just laughed and winked at them. &quot;Well, there&#39;s an awful lot of 
you... I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d ever pick one of you--&quot;

&quot;Pick me! Pick me!&quot; they all screamed.

Michiru sighed with exasperation. Haruka chuckled at her reaction and 
waved to the girls. &quot;We all have class to go to! Come on, we can talk 
about this later...&quot;

They rushed to obey Haruka&#39;s suggestion, falling over each other as they 
tried to get to their seats.

&quot;You shouldn&#39;t encourage them,&quot; Michiru whispered in Haruka&#39;s ear. 
&quot;Weren&#39;t you the one telling me how annoying they were...?&quot;

Haruka coughed a bit and acted innocent. &quot;Well, yes... but that was 
before you... now it&#39;s actually amusing!&quot;

Michiru sighed again and grabbed her hand to drag her into the 
classroom. &quot;We&#39;ll talk more about this later... the bell&#39;s about to 
ring.&quot;

&quot;Alright, alright...&quot;

&quot;Good morning class. We have two new students today, Ten&#39;ou Haruka and 
Kaiou Michiru...&quot;



Michiru fidgeted as she stood still for the tyourei. Her classmates 
still were drooling all over Haruka, even as they tried to act like they 
cared about the principal&#39;s speech. Michiru sighed irritably and tried 
to act like she didn&#39;t care at all. Haruka was smirking slightly and 
looked like she was holding back a laugh. When their teacher finally led 
them back to the classroom, Michiru pushed her way to stand by Haruka.

&quot;You really shouldn&#39;t encourage them,&quot; she murmured to Haruka.

&quot;Jealous, Michiru?&quot; Haruka said with a wink.

Michiru sniffled and shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t want to see all those poor 
girls have their hearts crushed when they realize you&#39;re just flirting 
with them.&quot;

&quot;Who said I&#39;m just flirting?&quot; Haruka laughed.

Michiru fixed her gaze on Haruka, and Haruka politely coughed. &quot;That 
is... I, um...&quot;

&quot;Just be careful,&quot; Michiru said sweetly.

&quot;HARUKA-SANNNNNNNNNN!!!&quot; the crowd of girls screamed when they realized 
they were being ignored.

The teacher whirled around and the crowd cowered. &quot;I won&#39;t tolerate any 
more outbursts like that. The next one to yell out like that is cleaning 
the toilets after school. On ALL the floors.&quot;

Michiru latched onto Haruka&#39;s arm with a smirk. Haruka sighed and let 
Michiru drag her into the classroom.



**********



Haruka finally stopped rapping her fingertips on the desk when Michiru 
gave her a sideways glance that clearly said &quot;enough.&quot; Haruka chuckled 
quietly and looked out the window, scowling at the sight of the dark 
crystal formation still towering in the air. She wished she knew what 
exactly it was, and how to get rid of it. She noticed Michiru look out 
the window also. The other students didn&#39;t seem to notice it, or if they 
did, they were acting like it wasn&#39;t there.

When it was time for lunch, Haruka motioned Michiru to stay behind. 
Michiru nodded in understanding. They stood by the window together, 
looking at the crystal. &quot;Do you think it&#39;s the same people making the 
daimon?&quot; Haruka asked in a low voice.

&quot;It doesn&#39;t feel the same,&quot; Michiru said softly. &quot;If they are made by 
these people... the Deathbusters... they must be using some different 
energy.&quot;

&quot;That wouldn&#39;t make sense. It must be someone else.&quot; Haruka said. &quot;Have 
you heard on the news about those Inner Senshi? There&#39;s been strange 
attacks going on for months... people losing their energy. This must be 
the people that caused it.&quot;

&quot;That would make sense,&quot; Michiru said with a nod. &quot;I wish we knew if it 
was important or not. I want to get rid of that thing,&quot; Michiru said, 
shivering.

&quot;I know, but we can&#39;t risk ourselves on that. It isn&#39;t our duty to stop 
big crystals,&quot; Haruka said with a small smile.

&quot;No, it&#39;s to find three special heart crystals,&quot; Michiru said sadly.

Haruka wrapped her arm around Michiru&#39;s shoulders and pulled her close. 
&quot;We&#39;ll find them. It&#39;s just going to take a little time.&quot;

&quot;I hope so,&quot; Michiru hugged her. &quot;We never wanted this.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;d have to be crazy to want this responsibility,&quot; Haruka chuckled. 
&quot;C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go get something to eat.&quot; Haruka gave her a tiny peck on 
the cheek and led her out of the room.



&quot;Kaiou Michiru and Ten&#39;ou Haruka?&quot;

Michiru looked up from her meal to see a lovely girl standing in front 
of her seat. She had straight white hair falling to her shoulders and 
ice blue eyes. She smiled at Michiru and sat down.

&quot;Welcome to Mugen Gakuen. I&#39;m Yuri Viluy, the top student here, and one 
of the science teachers. I just wanted to get you two acquainted with 
our school.&quot;

Haruka raised an eyebrow. &quot;Science teacher?&quot;

Viluy smiled at her. &quot;Yes, the students that excel and demonstrate 
leadership abilities are given the opportunity to teach their peers. I&#39;m 
sure you&#39;ll find our school offers students to chance to develop to 
their full potential. I understand you both received very high marks at 
your previous school. I&#39;ve asked your teacher permission to show you 
around the school during your next class.&quot;

Haruka didn&#39;t look interested but Michiru said sweetly, &quot;That would be 
wonderful. If you&#39;d excuse us while we finish lunch--&quot;

Viluy bowed and walked away.

&quot;Why did you agree--&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-san warned us there&#39;s something going on here. This will give 
us the chance to look around the school without arousing suspicion.&quot;

Haruka sighed and smiled at her, &quot;I should have realized, hmmm?&quot; She 
returned to eating.

Michiru suddenly dropped her fork and stood up. &quot;There&#39;s an attack,&quot; she 
mumbled, starting to hurry out of the cafeteria. Haruka quickly threw 
away their things and rushed to follow her. Michiru was moving a lot 
faster than she would have expected. Haruka felt a disturbing sensation 
on the back of her neck. There was something very wrong.

Michiru dashed outside into the alleyways nearby. Haruka follow her and 
quickly transformed with her. Neptune took off again, Uranus in pursuit. 
They could hear someone screaming in the parking lot, and leapt onto and 
over cars to get there as soon as they could.

Neptune slid to a halt, Uranus nearly crashing into her. &quot;Oh... oh 
no...&quot; Neptune whispered. The heart crystal flew from the victim&#39;s 
chest.

It was Cindy Grey.

&quot;World Shaking!&quot; Uranus shouted as Neptune dove for the crystal. Neptune 
held the heart crystal with trembling hands, examining it carefully. 
Uranus punched and kicked the daimon as Neptune turned it over in her 
hands. It was so bright, so full of life... she felt her throat tighten. 
It couldn&#39;t be Cindy, not Cindy... she couldn&#39;t have the Talisman...

&quot;Well?&quot; Uranus shouted between dodging and attacking. 

&quot;I... I...&quot; Neptune started hard at it. This was Elza&#39;s sister. She was 
holding her life between a pair of white gloves. Sweet Cindy... it 
couldn&#39;t be her. It had to be someone they didn&#39;t know, that they 
wouldn&#39;t care about...

Uranus grunted as the daimon&#39;s attack connected with her. She was thrown 
back against a car window, sending glass shards scattering. Neptune 
jumped in surprise and let the crystal slip a little. Her lips tightened 
in determination. She looked down at the crystal, not letting thoughts 
of friends and grief cloud her judgement.

It wasn&#39;t a Talisman.

She practically shoved the heart crystal back into Cindy, then attacked 
the daimon. It let out its final scream then died.

Neptune shakily propped Uranus up, whispering, &quot;It wasn&#39;t a Talisman... 
it wasn&#39;t a...&quot;

Uranus gripped her shoulders. &quot;Shhh, it&#39;s alright. I saw you give it 
back...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re bleeding--&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve had much worse,&quot; Uranus said, her face paling. &quot;This is nothing.&quot; 
She carefully stood up, twisting her head to examine her back. &quot;Ughhh... 
glass... this will take awhile to clean up.&quot;

Neptune bit her lower lip, looking down at Cindy. Cindy was stirring a 
bit and regaining color. &quot;We should go...&quot;

Uranus took Neptune&#39;s hand in hers and kissed her cheek. Neptune choked 
back her tears and carefully hugged Uranus. &quot;I was so scared it would be 
her. I thought I could handle if anyone had a Talisman, but someone we 
know...?&quot;

&quot;We have to do it. For the sake of the world.&quot; Uranus drew away from 
her. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to be the mature one,&quot; she said with a soft smile.

Neptune sniffled and nudged her in the side. &quot;I didn&#39;t think I&#39;d face a 
friend having their heart crystal taken. I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d have done 
if she&#39;d had a Talisman.&quot;

&quot;Hopefully we won&#39;t have to worry about that. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s nobody we 
know or care about.&quot;

&quot;I hope so.&quot; Neptune made Uranus turn around, and then gasped in 
surprise. &quot;The glass shards... they&#39;re... gone?&quot;

Uranus raised an eyebrow. &quot;How can that be?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure...&quot; Neptune stared at the cuts, lightly scabbing over. 
&quot;Maybe we heal a lot faster as Senshi...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;ll be handy,&quot; Uranus remarked. &quot;We should hurry up and head back 
to the building. It&#39;ll be suspicious if we&#39;re missing on the first day. 
Cindy will be fine.&quot;

They detransformed and started to walk back to the building. Haruka 
stopped Michiru and grabbed her hand. &quot;Michiru, you can&#39;t hesistate like 
that again, alright?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes widened in surprise. &quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re the one so serious about this--&quot; Haruka winked, &quot;so I 
think maybe you should follow your own advice, hmmmm?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Michiru sighed and blushed. &quot;You&#39;re right. I guess I was just a 
little shocked to see Cindy&#39;s heart crystal. It&#39;s scary... to hold a 
friend&#39;s life in your hands...&quot;

Haruka pressed herself to Michiru and kissed her deeply. &quot;Funny, you&#39;ve 
held mine in your hands before... you&#39;re very good at it...&quot;

Michiru giggled and pulled Haruka to her. &quot;Well, I guess you&#39;re right... 
after all...&quot; she gave her a peck on the lips, &quot;you have my heart, and I 
have yours.&quot;

&quot;We should get to--&quot; Haruka trailed off as Michiru pulled her into an 
alleyway and kissed her passionately. 

&quot;There&#39;s a few minutes left,&quot; Michiru whispered. &quot;Please... if we&#39;re 
going to have to fight even during school... We aren&#39;t going to have a 
lot of time together.&quot;

Haruka gazed into her eyes, then smiled and kissed her again. &quot;I love 
you, Michiru.&quot;

&quot;I love you, Haruka.&quot;

Haruka started to dip her face towards Michiru&#39;s neck, then noticed a 
faraway look on Michiru&#39;s face.

&quot;After school... Hikawa Jinja...&quot;

&quot;You can sense something is going to happen later?&quot; Haruka&#39;s eyes 
widened in shock.

Michiru shook her head to clear it. &quot;That was... strange... I&#39;ve never 
had anything like that before...&quot;

&quot;It must be important that we go there,&quot; she said, gripping Michiru&#39;s 
hand. &quot;Do you think...&quot;

&quot;The other Senshi.&quot; Michiru&#39;s eyes glazed. &quot;They will be... we have to 
go there...&quot;

Worriedly, Haruka supported Michiru. &quot;Why would they be there? They 
can&#39;t handle a daimon, from what I&#39;ve seen on the news reports...&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll just have to see for ourselves,&quot; Michiru said weakly, leaning 
against Haruka. &quot;Let&#39;s go back inside. We&#39;ve been gone too long already. 
I&#39;m sure Viluy is wondering why we didn&#39;t show up for the tour yet.&quot;

&quot;Michiru... I have a very bad feeling about her. She has something to do 
with whatever is going on at this school.&quot;

&quot;Do you think... maybe this school is the center for these daimons?&quot;

&quot;Maybe... perhaps Viluy like that red-head woman--&quot;

&quot;With the obnoxious display of cleavage?&quot; Michiru said with a sniff.

&quot;Ah... that is...&quot; Haruka started to lead Michiru back into the school. 
&quot;You know you&#39;re the only one I&#39;m interested in, hmmmm?&quot;

&quot;You haven&#39;t even seen it yet,&quot; Michiru said with a smirk. 

&quot;We can fix that later,&quot; Haruka commented distractedly as they entered 
the building.

Viluy was standing there, waiting for them. &quot;Ah, I see you&#39;re back. What 
kept you?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Michiru said lightly. &quot;Just getting some fresh air. Are you 
ready to give the tour?&quot;

&quot;Of course.&quot; Viluy turned and gestured with her arm to the entire 
building. Her white hair seemed to shine with her cold smile. Haruka 
tightened her arm around Michiru&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Welcome to Mugen Gakuen, 
the school for only the best students. We have a state of the art 
facility that will develop all students to their full potential. Only 
those with the strongest minds and the purest hearts will be accepted 
into our exclusive school...&quot;



The wind and the sea are forever joined, living as one for all time. 
Without one, the other can&#39;t exist. They meet as one at the horizon.

They made it past their pain and began their lives together, to be 
inseperable for all eternity.
