<h1>Don't Look Back (part 10 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>6 that night couldn&#146;t have come soon enough for Haruka as she walked 
slowly through the maze of campers and trailers, filled with tense 
edgy people. The first shoot had gone well, but lighting had failed by 
the time they&#146;d reached the second beach, causing them to loose a lot 
of time in setting up lighting for the lack of sunlight. She&#146;d hardly 
seen her Michiru all day&#133;

&#145;Back up, MY Michiru? If anyone could hear me now&#133;&#146; the blonde 
thought, blinking as she heard the first sound of laughter all night 
coming from Michiru&#146;s camper. Sneaking up to the open door, she peeked 
inside to see Michiru laughing so hard her eyes were watering. On 
further inspection, she found the cause. A very persistent blonde 
cousin torturing the British tech. Mike and Lil.

Of course.

Rolling her eyes, Haruka cleared her throat, gaining the attention of 
one Aquamarine haired beauty, but still ignored by the two wrestling 
on the floor.

Michiru tried to stifle her giggles at the look of exasperation on 
Haruka&#146;s face as the blonde looked at her &#145;mature&#146; cousin and her 
lover.

&#147;Ruka help!&#148; Lil giggled, trying in vain to keep Mike from tickling 
her as Haruka simply walked in, took Michiru&#146;s hand and walked out 
with her again. The British didn&#146;t know weather to thank her or curse 
at her.

&#147;Should we be leaving them alone?&#148; Michiru asked humorously as she was 
led away by her dinner date, looking back at her camper with mockingly 
fearful eyes, &#147;who knows what they&#146;ll be doing&#148;

Haruka nearly choked, knowing exactly what the two would do if they 
thought they could get away with it. Grinning, she winked back at 
Michiru.

&#147;Forget it, you don&#146;t want to know. My cousin&#146;s actions are something 
I really never want to learn of. Definitely not when you&#146;ve got Lil in 
the same room.&#148; The blonde murmured as they reached Haruka&#146;s 
motorcycle. Sliding on, she handed Michiru a helmet before the two 
sped away, unknowing of the two dark figures watching them&#133;

~ * ~

&#147;That little witch! First she ruins my shoot, then she takes off with 
MY boyfriend!&#148; Sarah hissed, standing tensely by Derek&#146;s side as he 
looked from the speeding cycle back to Michiru&#146;s abandoned trailer. A 
dark smile flitted across he lips as he thought of the young British 
inside. The other woman was no problem. Strike two problems in one 
night. Turning, he glanced at the fuming Sarah.

&#147;My dear, why don&#39;t you go and&#133;take care of Miss Michiru, I&#146;ll be 
waiting here when you get back.&#148; Derek murmured, pulling something 
heavy from his pocket. Dying sunlight glanced off the barrel of a 
heavy .45 as Sarah took one look at it before snatching it away, 
pushing it roughly into the waistband of her jeans before swinging 
into her black jeep, speeding after her love and his little bitch&#133;

~ * ~



&#147;Oh Haruka&#133;it&#146;s beautiful&#133;&#148; Michiru murmured, her eyes wide as she 
looked up at the English style coffeehouse.

&#147;Don&#39;t let it fool you. This place has the best Sashimi in all of 
Japan.&#148; The blonde smiled, hooking an arm loosely around Michiru&#146;s 
waist as she led the way into the restaurant area.

&#147;Mr. Ten&#39;oh! Hey Michiru!&#148; a bubbly voice called from one of the 
tables, causing Haruka to groan as they saw Chelle and a man sitting 
at the table near the back. Michiru smiled warmly, leading an almost 
reluctant Haruka over to see her friend. She was glad to see a 
friendly face again, still slightly chilled by Rei Hino&#146;s frosty 
response to her and the troubled looks of the other models. Lil and 
Mike seemed nice, but slightly self involved in their own little 
world, Lil spending most of her time making Mike nervous with her 
public displays of affection, like sitting on the tomboy&#146;s lap, doing 
anything to make the other girl blush. It was nice to see someone she 
called a close friend.

Chelle stood, giving Michiru a hug as they all sat down, Haruka and 
the man lapsing into a conversation of their own as Chelle fired 
questions about the shoot.

&#147;Everything is fine really. Almost everyone is friendly and knows 
everyone else&#133;&#148; Michiru stopped, biting her lip as she thought of the 
few small fights she&#146;d heard that day, &#147;but&#133;there&#146;s Sarah&#133;and 
something up between Mr. Windwood and Lil&#133;&#148;

Chelle stopped eating a moment to level a serious look on her before 
putting her fork down, and leaning in with a glance at Haruka.

&#147;Don&#39;t&#146; tell anyone I told you this, since Lil told me to never say a 
word. That thing with her and Derek? It goes WAY back. They both lived 
in central London during their university years. He put the moves on 
her and she started dating him, but she lost interest pretty soon when 
she first met Mike. Well, Mike left for the summer to come here, spent 
some time looking over Haruka&#146;s company and stuff, but Lil stayed in 
London. Apparently, Derek confronted her at a club one night, but said 
it was &#145;as friends&#146;, so she agreed to have some drinks with him. He 
slipped some sort of drug into her drink, and got her all doped up 
before taking her back to his pad. Michiru, he raped her. That&#146;s the 
big deal with him. And Sarah? She&#146;s his SISTER. She&#146;s been after 
Haruka for YEARS. You have to watch her. She&#146;s taken out a few good 
models.&#148; Chelle finished, blushing as she saw Michiru&#146;s shell shocked 
look. The younger girl had thought something lesser had happened, like 
some fight over a position in the company. But rape? A shudder ran 
through her torso as she remembered the feeling fear she&#146;d felt when 
she&#146;d almost been raped. Poor Lil.

&#147;Why did Haruka hire him then?!&#148;

Chelle frowned, shaking her head, &#147;She doesn&#146;t know. Derek made Lil 
feel like it was her fault; told her he was a drunk as she&#146;d been. 
Poor girl let him get away with rape. But Haruka&#146;s already told him 
his contract is over in a few days, since Usagi&#146;s back, Ruka doesn&#146;t 
need him.&#148;

Michiru felt something pull at the back of her head, a glint of 
something being exchanged by two people as she&#146;d glanced back when 
they were leaving. Something that looked like a gun&#133;two 
people&#133;Sarah&#133;and Derek! He&#146;d been looking back at her trailer where 
Lil and Mike were!

Screams suddenly ripped thought the air as shots rang out, blood 
spattering across the foursome&#146;s table. Chelle let out a long chilling 
scream as the man she&#146;d been with slumped onto the table, half a 
second before Michiru instinctively slammed her body into the shocked 
girls, throwing them both to the floor.

Turning, she stared in horror at the door where the dark-haired Sarah 
stood, gun clutched in white knuckled hands&#133; </pre>
