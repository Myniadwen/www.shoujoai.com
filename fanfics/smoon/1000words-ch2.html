<a href="../smoon/1000words-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Lavender eyes opened and the young woman stretched, basking in the 
warmth of her covers and the sunlight pouring into the room.

Slowly, she slipped out of bed, heading for the adjacent bathroom.

Within half an hour, she stepped out of her room and into the long 
hallway. She walked down the hall and slid open the rice paper door, 
quickly putting on her shoes.

A man with unruly black hair and thick bangs that covered his eyes was 
sweeping the floor, dressed in the traditional robe of a Shinto priest.

&quot;G&#39;morning, Yuuchiro-kun.&quot;

&quot;Good morning, Rei-chan!&quot; He greeted with a huge grin. &quot;You&#39;re up 
earlier than usual.&quot;

The woman frowned slightly at the reminder. There was a reason she was 
up early.

&quot;Yeah, I figured I&#39;d head down to the office early to get a head-start 
on today&#39;s work.&quot;

The longhaired man just laughed and waved goodbye as the raven-haired 
woman walked down the steps. She hailed a cab and got in, giving the 
driver the address of the office.

Lavender eyes looked out the window. The sun was barely up.

Speaking of which, the reason why she was up already. She didn&#39;t like 
lying to Yuuchiro-kun, but she didn&#39;t want to worry him.

She was roused from her sleep last night. Not by Yuuchiro-kun&#39;s singing, 
not by the phone nor by a bad dream. It was because of a feeling.

That&#39;s right, a feeling. She found herself pulled from sleep at three in 
the morning with sweat pouring down her face. Her sleepy mind tried to 
grasp the reason for her awakening when she felt it.

Warm and very familiar presence that radiated power. But it couldn&#39;t be. 
Only one person had that aura and she hasn&#39;t been in Japan for six 
years.

But she knew she felt it. Hino Rei was a miko after all and she trusted 
her instincts. Even if it meant the impossible had happened and she was 
in Tokyo.

&#39;Don&#39;t think about this, Hino. Actually, don&#39;t think about her.&#39;

The dark-haired woman shook her head. This was utter foolishness. 
Trusting her instincts aside, it was illogical for her to be back in 
Japan. She had such a nice life as a star in America, why return?

Besides, even if she was back, why should it matter to her? They were no 
longer a couple. So what if it&#39;s never actually been said that they were 
over? Nothing&#39;s been said, honestly, but the relationship was definitely 
over.

And her many flings and lovers were the perfect evidence. A singer here, 
an actress there, a businessman somewhere in between...

Her career could be charted by whom she went out with when each song 
came out. And they were both long lists...

&#39;You&#39;re being stupid. She left six years ago and she&#39;s never come back 
since. She&#39;s not going to come back at all. You have no reason to want 
her to, remember?&#39;

Part of her knew that was a lie. After all, so many things between them 
had been left unsaid.

&#39;Perhaps it&#39;s better that way.&#39;

Rei didn&#39;t know who she was fooling as she stepped out of the cab.

The miko stepped out of the elevator. She had changed her mind about 
coming to work early and ended up curling up with a good book at a 
library nearby. Ah, the influence of Mizuno Ami...

The desks were surprisingly empty but a look at the clock told her 
everyone was probably crowding in front of the T.V. watching &#39;Luna.&#39; It 
was 8:30 so the big name would be on right about now.

Rei walked by the conference room to find everyone squished as close as 
they could be around the projector. She sighed softly and started to 
walk away when she heard it.

&quot;Aino Minako!&quot;

Lavender eyes widened and her lips parted while time itself seemed to 
slow, causing her own movements to stretch on for hours.

No, it couldn&#39;t be. She couldn&#39;t be back. She couldn&#39;t have been right.

&quot;Well, Aino-san, it&#39;s great that you&#39;re back in Japan. You&#39;ve been gone 
for six years! Why so long?&quot;

The miko turned slowly, raven locks flying in the air as her eyes sought 
out the screen on which the show was being projected. Dear god, no.

And there she was, Aino Minako, on the white sheet of plastic. As 
beautiful as ever.

The years have only made her even more so, actually, the barely there 
baby fat of 17 now completely gone, leaving behind a lean and gorgeous 
face with that warm smile and those twinkling blue eyes. She seemed both 
confident and relaxed sitting there, talking to Luna, her legs crossed 
as she leaned slightly toward the host.

Rei felt like someone just knocked the breath out of her.

She was back.

Rei stormed into her office, slamming her door shut as she shed her 
light jacket. Well, more like threw it on the floor before stalking over 
to the glass wall. She pulled open the shades, the morning light 
streaming in and bathing her in soft tones of yellow and orange.

Damn it, she was back. Back in Japan. Back in Tokyo.

Why was this happening? The miko&#39;s been fine without her, without the 
reminders. Damn it all.

The door opened and the woman was in no mood to turn around and plaster 
a fake smile on her face.

&quot;So, I see you&#39;ve heard.&quot;

The dry statement did not improve Rei&#39;s mood. Quite the opposite, 
actually.

&quot;No shit.&quot;

The heels of the intruder&#39;s shoes clicked as she walked across the 
hardwood floor.

&quot;So?&quot;

&quot;So what?&quot;

The person sighed and Rei could detect the faint scent of peaches and 
cream. She feltother woman near her and sighed.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot;

&quot;Completely understandable.&quot;

&quot;At least something is,&quot; the miko mumbled distastefully.

The other woman gave a brief snort. The clicks grew softer, informing 
Rei that she was leaving.

&quot;You know what this means.&quot;

The miko nodded. Once she was sure the other woman was gone, she closed 
her eyes and let her shoulders slump.

&quot;Aino Minako...&quot;

The lavender orbs opened and she shut the blinds roughly.

&quot;Why are you back?&quot;

The raven-haired woman growled in annoyance and pushed her chair away 
from the desk. She turned and looked out the window at the skyline of 
Tokyo. It&#39;s eleven in the afternoon and for the past two hours, she&#39;s 
been trying to get work done but to no avail. Nothing! Her mind kept 
wandering back to Minako...

Her closed and a hand reached up to massage her temple. This. Was. 
Insane.

She opened her eyes and looked at the phone. Maybe she could call 
someone...

No, no. Everyone was far too busy to listen to her rant about the 
reappearance of her ex and to her, basically, breaking down.

&#39;You can do this, Hino. Just read through a couple of documents and 
that&#39;ll get your mind off of her.&#39;

She sighed and went back to the papers in front of her.

It took her ten minutes before she realized she&#39;d read the same line 
three dozen times.

&quot;Fuck it.&quot;

She picked up the phone and dialed a well-memorized number. The phone 
rang twice before a female voice with a thick British accent picked up 
and spoke to her in English.

&quot;Good afternoon, London Memorial Hospital, how can I help you?&quot;

&quot;Hello. Can you please dial the extension 2244 for me?&quot;

&quot;Of course. Just a moment please.&quot;

There was a soft click and a few seconds of silence before the miko 
heard ringing. She crossed her fingers, hoping she&#39;d be there.

&quot;Dr. Mi-&quot;

&quot;Hey, it&#39;s me,&quot; Rei interrupted in Japanese.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

The miko sighed in relief at the soft voice that pronounced her name 
with a hint of an English accent.

&quot;Rei? Are you there?&quot;

The accent disappeared when the speaker switched to Japanese. The miko 
smiled.

&quot;Yes, Ami, I&#39;m here.&quot;

The faint clicking of a keyboard reached her ears.

&quot;I haven&#39;t caught you at a bad time, have I?&quot;

&quot;No, actually. It&#39;s been a slow day.&quot;

Rei chuckled and relaxed in her chair.

&quot;Considering you&#39;re a doctor, I&#39;d say that&#39;s a good thing.&quot;

The blue-haired woman on the line laughed softly. Silence followed.

&quot;Rei, you didn&#39;t call me to say &#39;Hi&#39;, did you?&quot;

The lavender-eyed woman sighed softly and leaned forward on her desk.

&quot;Perhaps I did. Maybe I was hoping to catch you in bed.&quot;

Ami snorted uncharacteristically. &quot;You know it&#39;s two in the afternoon 
here. And you did call me at the hospital and not at home.&quot;

&quot;Ah, you&#39;re right.&quot;

Silence again. Rei could imagine Ami frown and narrow her eyes slightly 
in annoyance.

&quot;Rei-&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s back.&quot;

The miko felt as if a great weight had been lifted from her shoulders.

&quot;Who&#39;s back?&quot;

There was another pause.

&quot;Rei-&quot;

&quot;Minako.&quot;

Neither of them spoke. The miko could practically see the shocked and 
puzzled expression on her friend&#39;s face. She could hear the gears 
turning in that brilliant mind of hers, piecing everything together and 
trying to make sense of that she&#39;d just been told.

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

The question eased the miko&#39;s tension. Ami, ever the skeptic.

&quot;I saw her on television today.&quot;

&quot;Rei, she&#39;s always on T.V.&quot;

&quot;On Luna?&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Oh. A simple &#39;oh.&#39; It did not fit Mizuno Ami at all and perhaps that 
reaction summed up how surprising the event was far better than Rei&#39;s.

&quot;When did she come back?&quot;

&quot;Last night.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

The miko licked her lips and leaned her head against her bent arm.

&quot;I felt her.&quot;

&quot;You felt her?&quot;

&quot;Yes, I felt her, Ami. I felt her. I felt her aura the second she 
stepped off that plane last night at three.&quot;

&quot;How do you know it was her?&quot;

&quot;Ami, I&#39;m a freaking miko!&quot;

The young doctor did not respond as Rei sighed and closed her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m also her ex-girlfriend.&quot;

A sigh came from the other end.

&quot;So, what do we do?&quot;

Rei arched a brow at the question, even though she knew her friend could 
not see it.

&quot;We? What do you mean, &#39;we?&#39;&quot;

&quot;We have to do something.&quot;

&quot;No, we don&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;The day&#39;s drawing closer.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s Usagi&#39;s job,&quot; the miko whispered heatedly.

&quot;Rei, it&#39;s our duty.&quot;

&quot;Apparently that meant squat to her.&quot;

&#39;I meant squat to her.&#39;

&quot;She&#39;s your ex.&quot;

&quot;I think that&#39;s more than enough reason to stay away.&quot;

Ami sighed, her patient dwindling.

&quot;You&#39;re being foolish-&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rei snapped back, &quot;you are. I&#39;m not going to go back to her like a 
dog and beg to talk about this. She ran away from it. From us.&quot;

Ami wasn&#39;t sure which &#39;us&#39; Rei meant, but knew better than to ask. She 
understood her friend&#39;s view, really she did. But, sometimes, personal 
things just don&#39;t matter when there&#39;s a bigger picture. And damn, was 
there a bigger picture right now.

&quot;Rei, I know she hurt you. I know. But this isn&#39;t only about you and 
her. This is something so much greater and more important.&quot;

The miko&#39;s growl of anger and sigh of relenting mixed, resulting in a 
kind of pathetic whimper. The young doctor felt guilt swell up inside of 
her.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to do it now. Just know you might have to soon. I&#39;ll 
talk it over with Mako.&quot;

&quot;Fine.&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan, sorry but I have to go.&quot;

&quot;I should too. Tell Makoto I said hi?&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Ames.&quot;

&quot;Bye, Rei,&quot; the young woman hesitated. &quot;Take care of yourself.&quot;

The miko said nothing and hung up.

The good thing was, she told someone and so the pressure was off. Bad 
thing, Ami reminded her of the fact that not only will she eventually 
have to see Minako again when the day arrived, she might even have to 
talk to her even before that. Damn it.

Rei sighed and leaned back in her chair, eyes closed. See her, face to 
face. No way in hell. If she had to talk to her, she&#39;ll contact the 
blonde only by phone. That&#39;ll push actually seeing her back a few years. 
She hoped.

Either way, she&#39;ll be damned if she went looking for her before she had 
to. This time, Rei was going to play by her own rules.

The young miko walked down the busy street of Tokyo, heading for her 
favorite Chinese restaurant for lunch. She was going to relax, feed 
herself good food and go back to work, ready to actually be productive 
this time.

Hino Rei has never felt completely at ease in the big city. She&#39;s always 
preferred the quiet life in the country or the relaxed atmosphere of the 
suburbs. But that didn&#39;t mean she didn&#39;t appreciate big cities in all 
their splendor. The beauty of the skyscrapers and the ability to find 
almost anything were just a few of the perks.

Though, the amount of people did get on her nerves at times. Like now 
during lunch hour. Everyone&#39;s running around, trying to get to his or 
her destination. But today, or at least right now, she didn&#39;t mind even 
that. It was sort of nice blending into a crowd and disappearing in the 
throng of faces. It was enough to make you forget you&#39;re an individual, 
that you have your own thoughts and worries. For now, that was 
comforting.

Rei passed the large record store, a block away from her destination, 
and watched the people go in and out. She needed to pick up a CD 
later...

She was almost at the restaurant when she felt it. No, felt her.

Coming ever closer. Her lavender eyes scanned the streets, trying to 
pinpoint the exact location only to realize it was moving too fast for 
her to be on foot. The young woman stiffened when she saw the black limo 
and her heart pounded painfully in her chest. Oh god, oh god.

On instincts, Rei turned and started walking in the direction from which 
she came. She ignored the looks she got and picked up her speed. She 
knew how sharp Minako&#39;s eyes were and she&#39;ll be damned if she gives the 
blonde a chance to see her face in the crowd. Minako always looked out 
the windows in cars.

Suddenly, she heard the screeching of car tires and the honking of 
several horns. A faint &#39;Minako!&#39; reached her ears.

Fuck, she did see her.

Rei picked up the pace again, mind reeling for a way out. She was 
closing in. Damn, was she running?

The music store appeared and the miko almost jumped. She stuffed her 
hands into her pockets and kept her head down. Minako was so close...

The raven-haired woman stepped into the store and instinctively climbed 
the stairs that led to the second floor. Seconds later, she felt Minako 
enter as well and allowed herself to look from behind a column.

And there she was, in flesh and blood. It&#39;s one thing to know she was 
there and to feel her, it&#39;s another thing to see her.

Aino Minako was a masterpiece of rosy cheeks and sharp blue eyes that 
was meant to be marveled at. She was a person meant to awe everyone that 
sees her and to utterly mesmerize him or her with her beauty.

Her sun kissed locks still had that healthy, spun gold shine, though it 
was longer than Rei remembered. She had grown out her bangs so that they 
now framed her lovely face, the color of the long locks going perfectly 
with her light tan.

The plump, pink lips looked as kissable, if not more so, than before. 
She was also taller, though that might be because of the sandals. She 
wore the same outfit as she did on Luna and Rei was stuck again by how 
the projection did her no justice.

The image on the screen didn&#39;t capture her aura, a pulsing, lively 
orange that radiated with power and confidence. It didn&#39;t allow the 
viewers to experience the warmth of her presence and the excitement that 
only Minako could project. An excitement like the buzz of a sugar high 
and adrenaline combined.

But most of all, images could never reproduce the intensity and power of 
those baby blues of hers. Eyes that seem to shine and project a light so 
bright it was blinding.

Rei felt more than a bit worried as time sped up again and someone 
realized Aino Minako was in the store. A music store, to make things 
worse. Her hand gripped the column as the crowd rushed towards the 
blonde.

But even as the hands tugged on the star and threatened to tear her 
apart, her eyes continued to scan the store. Rei watched as the singer&#39;s 
security arrived and began escorting her out. As the blue eyes continued 
to roam the crowd, their eyes met for a split second and the miko was 
forced to lock her knees to keep them from buckling.

In that one moment, Rei gazed into the eyes of the woman she hasn&#39;t seen 
for years. In that single glance, she saw everything she had seen when 
she was fourteen: the strength, the determination, the hope and 
confidence.

But she also saw what she hadn&#39;t expected to see nine years ago and 
expected even less to see now: the loneliness, the self-doubt and the 
fear.

Everything she had seen when she first looked into those blue eyes all 
those years ago.

The very things that made her fall in love with Aino Minako.

Rei felt like a caged animal as she paced. Maybe that&#39;s why the whole 
office was avoiding her. Avoiding the inner beast that was so angry and 
high strung that it forced her to yell at five people already.

&#39;Calm down, Hino. They&#39;ve done nothing to you. Don&#39;t take it out on 
them.&#39;

Just then the phone rang, causing her to jump into the air. She growled, 
angry at the phone, Minako, herself and whoever was calling.

&quot;Fuck it,&quot; she mumbled before grabbing the receiver.

&quot;Hello?&quot; she barked.

&quot;Whoa, did I catch you at a bad time?&quot;

Rei calmed upon hearing the familiar voice.

&quot;Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Hey, Rei-chan,&quot; the brunette greeted cheerfully. &quot;What&#39;s got you so 
wound up?&quot;

Before she could stop herself, the miko told her friend everything, from 
sensing Minako to the music store.

&quot;Wow,&quot; Makoto said at the end. &quot;Ami told me Mina was back and I knew 
something was going to happen but I didn&#39;t expect things to go so 
quickly.&quot;

&quot;You can&#39;t run from destiny, eh?&quot; Rei asked sarcastically, her voice 
taking on a bitter and hurt quality that made her friend want to pound 
Minako into the floor.

&quot;No, Rei, you can&#39;t. Whether you like it or not, you two are bound by a 
destiny far greater than emotions and will alone can conquer.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I know. We&#39;ve all seen proof of that destiny, all right?&quot;

Makoto sighed and searched her brain for a way to help her friend.

&quot;Rei,&quot; she started quietly, &quot;it&#39;ll all work out.&quot;

&quot;Maybe in Usagi&#39;s fairytale but not in mine.&quot;

&quot;Rei... oh yeah. The other reason I called you.&quot;

The miko arched a brow and sighed softly.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m thinking about asking Ami to marry me.&quot;

Rei&#39;s jaw dropped as she leaned back to sit on her desk but managed to 
miss it completely and land on the floor with a loud thud. She groaned 
softly and sat up, rubbing her back.

&quot;Rei?! You okay? What happened?&quot;

The dark-haired woman glared at her desk as she slowly stood.

&quot;Let&#39;s just say gravity got to me.&quot;

Makoto opened her mouth to comment when she was cut off by Rei.

&quot;Really? You&#39;re going ask her to marry you?! Wow! I didn&#39;t think you&#39;d 
marry first!&quot;

The brunette blushed and played with her hair, thankful that her friend 
couldn&#39;t see her.

&quot;I know it&#39;s early. I mean, Ami just finished Med. School last year and 
it&#39;s her first year working. The Restaurant is doing great but its grand 
opening was just a few months ago. We haven&#39;t even been living together 
for two years yet-&quot;

&quot;Mako?&quot;

The brunette stopped mid-rant. &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

Silence.

&quot;Of course Ami will marry you. No, it&#39;s not too early. She loves you and 
you love her. You two are perfect for each other! I just always thought 
Usa and Mamoru would marry first, ya know?&quot;

Makoto laughed, both at her own foolishness and the amused tone of Rei&#39;s 
voice.

&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean, Rei. I always thought so too. But ya know, 
it just seems right to do it now. I have the feeling.&quot;

The miko smiled softly, glad to hear Makoto so happy and content. Part 
of her couldn&#39;t help but feel envious.

&quot;Well, I guess a lot of things are set in stone, Rei-chan. But at the 
same time, a lot of things aren&#39;t.&quot;

Lavender eyes closed as a small smile touched the ruby lips.

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

Everything then went smoothly for Rei. She&#39;d taken off the rest of 
afternoon the day after her conversation with Makoto and returned to the 
office the next morning ready to work. She even managed to catch up on 
all of the work she didn&#39;t finish due to the Minako incident...s...

Speaking of Minako.

The miko didn&#39;t mind the idea of the idol in the same city as her too 
much, anymore. Tokyo was huge. So, they happened to cross paths again, 
sort of, yesterday. But that was just a coincidence and it most likely 
wouldn&#39;t happen again.

&quot;Yo, Hino.&quot;

The young woman looked up at the Asian woman sitting in the chair across 
from her. She didn&#39;t wonder how she&#39;d gotten there without her noticing, 
she was used to it.

&quot;So, Utena, what do you need?&quot;

The woman in the black business suit shrugged.

&quot;To see if you finished with the Kiro file yet.&quot;

&quot;Ah... not yet. Almost done.&quot;

The shorter woman nodded and regarded Rei with her intense brown eyes. 
The miko looked up from the document seconds later and met the gaze of 
her superior.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You know, Rei, I&#39;ve always supported you, even when everyone thought 
your ideas and plans were completely off. And as a reward for my 
loyalty, your plans and you have always pulled through on top. You know 
I&#39;ll be there for you through thick and thin.&quot;

The woman paused, seemingly to choose the worlds. Rei arched a brow and 
leaned on her elbows, wondering where she was going with this.

&quot;And considering what happened with Aino...&quot;

The miko unconsciously stiffened.

&quot;I can understand your reaction. But we... I expect nothing but for you 
to conduct yourself in a professional manner despite your personal life. 
Now, it&#39;s understandable to have a bad day or to let your emotions get 
the better of you, but yesterday was unacceptable.&quot;

Lavender eyes closed and the woman nodded curtly. She had a job to do, 
regardless of what Minako did to her. And she couldn&#39;t lose this job.

&quot;All right, now that that&#39;s settled,&quot; the shorter woman said as she 
stood, &quot;get back to work, Pyro.&quot;

She walked towards the door but Rei couldn&#39;t let her go just yet.

&quot;Utena?&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

Utena turned and shot Rei a quick smile before walking out. The senshi 
of fire smiled and leaned back in her chair.

Everything will be just fine.

Rei breathed in deeply, the fragrance of the grass and blooming flowers 
filling her senses. It was a beautiful spring day. Perhaps she&#39;ll have 
lunch at the Crown Arcade and take the rest of the day off again. She 
could sure use the rest.

She stepped into the familiar place and sat down at the counter. A 
waitress asked her for her order and she figured she&#39;d revisit the old 
time and have a burger with fries and a milkshake.

As she looked around, she knew she looked completely out of place in her 
stone gray business suit. Oh well, not her fault she had to meet with a 
client before.

As she ate her meal, a group of giggling girls walked in, out of classes 
early, so it seemed. They sat down at a booth, their booth, as Rei 
watched their happy expressions, mischievous eyes and heard their 
laughter. She couldn&#39;t help but remember a time when she and the others 
used to do all of that.

Remember how they&#39;d sit at the shrine in her room and talk about the 
most random things, from boys to the future to shopping. She was 
happiest then.

Not to say she wasn&#39;t happy now. She loved her job and the unexpected 
direction her life has taken. But it&#39;s not the same. Not with Ami and 
Makoto in England, Usagi in America with Mamoru, Hotaru in college in 
China and Haruka and Michiru touring all the time. Setsuna was living in 
Tokyo but was often busy or at the Gates of Time.

She wished it could be like the past. Just the five of them studying at 
the shrine and the Outers preparing a feast at the mansion for when 
they&#39;d be done. No test was too hard, no day too bad and no youma was 
too strong when they were together.

Rei finished her burger and fries before she even realized and left 
after paying. As she crossed the street, she was too busy admiring what 
a wonderful day it was to notice the black car that pulled up in front 
of the Crown Arcade or to feel that pulsing aura.

&quot;Yuuchiro-kun! I&#39;m home!&quot;

The shaggy-haired man appeared and grinned widely at the woman that just 
made her way up the long flight of stairs.

&quot;Rei-chan! You&#39;re home early!&quot;

The miko gave the older man a smile and nodded.

&quot;Took the rest of the day off again.&quot;

&quot;About time you got some rest!&quot;

Rei smiled and looked around to see if there was anything she could do.

&quot;Hmm... I think I&#39;m going to take a nap. Call me if you need anything?&quot;

Yuuchiro nodded as Rei made her way to her room.

Rei sighed when she entered her room, stripping out of her suit and into 
a pair of shorts and a white Tee. Yuuchiro-kun was the priest now and 
there was on need for her to really do anything around the shrine now 
that they hired someone to help out in the afternoon.

So, she was going to relax. She sat down on her bed and grabbed a 
magazine from off the floor. She&#39;ll clean her room later...

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Came Yuuchiro&#39;s trembling voice.

The miko sat up, disappointed that she was interrupted already.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Rei-chan, I think you better come out.&quot;

The confused woman rose and stepped out, only to find the Shinto priest 
fidgeting.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I... I just saw Minako.&quot;

Rei stiffened as her thoughts came to a crashing halt. No way. She 
couldn&#39;t... it was impossible.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

He nodded. &quot;Positive. I saw her come up the stairs.&quot;

Before Rei knew what she was doing. She found herself walking outside. 
Her thoughts were a mess.

Why was she here? Better question, why was she going to find her? She 
should go back inside and pretend Yuuchiro never told her. That would be 
the smart thing to do. Avoid her until the last, possible moment. She 
thought she&#39;d decided to do that. Minako had left her, not the other way 
around.

But the singer was here, which meant she wanted to see her. Right?

Rei could feel her aura as she continued down the path.

&#39;God, Aino, what the hell are you doing here? What do you want to prove? 
That you can revisit the past without hurting? Well, I can&#39;t.&#39;

The miko stopped when she saw the figure framed by the closed sakura 
blossoms on either side of the path. The golden mane was tied back with 
a red ribbon, just like in the old days.

Rei couldn&#39;t think, couldn&#39;t breath. Dear lord, she must be insane.

Nonetheless, she took a deep breath and forced her voice to contain the 
confidence she didn&#39;t have and to maintain that bored drawl while her 
heart pounded.

&quot;Well, look what the spring brought back.&quot;


Hello! Here&#39;s the next chapter! I thought I&#39;d give you guys a taste of 
what Rei&#39;s going through. Minako&#39;s not the only one suffering here!

I know I keep hinting about their breakup but I haven&#39;t actually said a 
single thing about it other than they didn&#39;t talk about it. That&#39;ll all 
be revealed later. For now, I plan on just how they react now in the 
present rather than in the past.

The next chapter will be, of course, the confrontation. Well, not really 
confrontation but their first face-to-face meeting in five years. 
Actually, it&#39;ll be the first time they talk in five years. That promises 
to be interesting.

Oh, as for anyone that reads &#39;Fallen From Grace,&#39; Utena once again joins 
the cast of OCs. I like her! And Rei does need someone around her that 
doesn&#39;t know Minako.

Is there anything else I need to address? I don&#39;t know. Oh, one more 
thing. This will probably be my last update; actually I know this will 
be my last update, of this fic until I get back from vacation. That&#39;s 
mid-August. I&#39;ll be working on this fic but it&#39;ll just be a while before 
you guys actually see any new material. Sorry!</pre>
