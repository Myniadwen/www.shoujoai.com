Finally, Haruka and Michiru are NOT cousins.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	The elevator opened onto the floor and Haruka stepped out.  Her 
jeans were caked with grease and dirt.  Her tank top was smudged and 
soaked with perspiration, as was her face and hair.  She sighed out her 
breathing as she walked down the hall to their apartment because she was 
tired and spent.  But there was a satisfied smile on her face.  It 
remained as she turned the knob and entered.

	&quot;Is it fixed?&quot; she heard Michiru ask.

  	Turning to the sound of the voice, Haruka found her off in a 
corner by the picture window that overlooked the bay.  Her easel was out 
and she was dabbing at a canvas with a long black brush with beige 
bristles.  Haruka stared for a moment.  She could never understand how 
Michiru managed to bring such devastatingly powerful artworks to life.  
To her she was just randomly stabbing at a canvas with the brush, but 
Michiru seemed to know intuitively just where to stab.  

	&quot;It&#39;s fixed,&quot; Haruka said, her fatigue in her husky voice.  &quot;The 
piston rings had carbon build-up on them and the plugs weren&#39;t in 
sequence.  I don&#39;t think the parking garage attendant appreciated me 
ripping up the engine right there in the garage, but I hate to hear my 
baby suffer.&quot;

	&quot;He&#39;ll get over it,&quot; Michiru replied.  &quot;I&#39;m glad you were able to 
help &#39;your baby&#39;.&quot;

	Haruka smiled.  Her explanation, as did anything auto-related, had 
gone right over Michiru&#39;s head, but Michiru had the good manners to at 
least feign interest for her partner&#39;s sake.  She walked over, leaned 
down and kissed Michiru on the top of the head.  Michiru&#39;s mouth curled 
up.  

	Then her nose curled up.

	&quot;Ooh,&quot; she said softly.  &quot;Haruka dear, I love you more than life 
itself, but you smell.&quot;

	&quot;Sorry,&quot; chuckled Haruka.  &quot;I&#39;ll get cleaned up.&quot;  She started to 
turn, then halted.  &quot;Care to scrub my back?&quot;

	Michiru froze in mid stroke.  Her eyes hooded and the edges of her 
mouth curled up again.  She considered the notion for a few seconds.

	&quot;You know I can&#39;t resist the water,&quot; she rumbled.  &quot;You get 
started.  I&#39;ll join you after I&#39;ve put my paints away and clean my 
brushes.&quot;

	Pausing long enough to retrieve a bucket from the kitchen, Haruka 
went into the bathroom.  She stripped down to her naked skin and stuffed 
her soiled clothing into the bucket, then squirted in some soap with an 
oil and grease breaking agent and filled it to the brim.  Eschewing the 
bath, she crossed over to the shower, her lanky frame unconsciously 
radiating power as she walked.  Adjusting the water until it was the 
precise temperature, Haruka stepped in.

	Allowing the water to fall down on her face and head and dribble 
down her body, Haruka exhaled a deep sigh.  The water was just warm 
enough to be soothing and the impact of the droplets on her skin was the 
next best thing to a massage.  It was several minutes before Haruka even 
made the effort to reach for the soap.  Even then she luxuriated beneath 
the spray, slowly soaping her arms and face, rubbing the lather into her 
short sandy hair instead of searching for shampoo.

	Unexpectedly, hands began caressing her back.  Rather than jump, 
Haruka seemed to tighten all over, then sagged against the hands with a 
pleasant release.  She felt lips press to a spot between her shoulder 
blades.  

	&quot;You are tired,&quot; Michiru&#39;s melodic voice floated up to her ears 
from behind her.  &quot;You didn&#39;t jump.&quot;

	&quot;I was expecting you,&quot; Haruka sighed.

	Michiru&#39;s hands worked their way up Haruka&#39;s back, the palms and 
the tips of her fingers skillfully kneading the muscles as they worked 
soap onto the skin.  Haruka felt her spine tingle and a spot in between 
her legs clench.  She let out another sigh, one that seemed to come from 
the depths of her being.  Michiru&#39;s soapy hands slid down her arms.

	&quot;Turn around,&quot; Michiru told her.  Haruka complied and found 
herself face to face with her naked, wet lover.  The water cascaded down 
her back, rinsing the soap off of her.  &quot;Your face is still grubby,&quot; she 
clucked.  

	Working a lather into her hands, Michiru leaned up on tiptoes and 
began washing Haruka&#39;s face.  Haruka didn&#39;t mind - - Michiru&#39;s touch was 
always welcomed - - and extending herself caused Michiru to lean into 
Haruka, causing their breasts to touch, which was also always welcome.  
Haruka glanced down at her sea goddess and the look she gave back told 
the woman that might have been the plan all along.  Michiru&#39;s green hair 
was wet and matted to her head.  Her ivory skin glistened with the thin 
sheen of water.  Haruka breathing became shallow as she was mesmerized 
by the sight.  There was something about the way Michiru looked when she 
was wet - - something primal, like an untamed sea nymph.

	Michiru&#39;s hands glided down her lover&#39;s neck and began soaping her 
shoulders.  Haruka leaned back and rinsed off her face.  At that moment, 
she felt Michiru&#39;s soapy hands close around her breasts and the surprise 
made Haruka gulp in water.

	&quot;Cough!&quot; Haruka sputtered, amid the sound of Michiru&#39;s twittering 
laugh.  &quot;Oh, that&#39;s the way you want to play it, huh?&quot;

	Before Michiru could react, she was seized and squeezed against 
Haruka&#39;s sinewy frame.  Haruka bent her backwards and began nibbling on 
her neck and shoulder.  Michiru dissolved into giggles as the water 
rained down on them.  Bent at that angle, she was helpless to do 
anything to resist.

	&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; she squealed.  Haruka let her up and she 
nearly doubled over with laughter.  When she recovered, she straightened 
up and looked into her lover&#39;s eyes tenderly.  &quot;Let me make it up to 
you.&quot;

	&quot;My favorite part,&quot; Haruka replied with that naughty boy&#39;s grin 
that always made her knees weak.

	Still in the shower, Michiru sank to her knees and steadied her 
hands on Haruka&#39;s hips.  She paused only long enough to shoot her 
partner a sly look, then leaned in and began caressing the woman&#39;s pubic 
mound with her tongue as the water beat down on her head.

	It was as if someone had pulled the plug on the drain and all 
conscious thought began to swirl out of her mind.  Haruka&#39;s senses shut 
off.  She forgot where she was.  She forgot who she was.  She forgot 
everything.  All she could think of was the tingling sensation between 
her legs.

	&quot;Uhh,&quot; she began, then couldn&#39;t remember what else she wanted to 
say.

	&quot;Don&#39;t talk,&quot; Michiru said between strokes.  &quot;Just enjoy.&quot;

	Haruka reached up and grabbed onto the shower head for support.  
She bowed her head because it somehow helped her to breathe.  Her free 
hand reached up and began massaging her breastbone.  What she felt was 
so intense she wanted to scream or cry or something, and the feeling was 
growing with every stroke.  But she kept it suppressed - - and she 
couldn&#39;t seem to make her mouth work anyway.

	It was coming.  It was coming.  Haruka&#39;s rangy frame seemed to 
contract into itself.  She released the shower head and oozed against 
the side of the shower.  There was no strength left in her limbs.  There 
was nothing in the universe other than that spot between her legs and 
its direct link to the back of her brain.

	&quot;AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; wrenched from her throat.  She sank to her 
knees, Michiru catching her fall.  Haruka grabbed the woman and clutched 
her tightly to her body.  She panted on Michiru&#39;s shoulder, eyes still 
clamped shut.

	&quot;There, there, my baby,&quot; Michiru cooed into her ear, stroking 
Haruka&#39;s back as the water continued to pour down on them.  &quot;I&#39;ve got 
you.&quot;  Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Haruka blush.  Michiru 
smiled, her lover that much more endeared to her.

	When Haruka regained enough strength to stand, they shut off the 
shower and stepped out.  Michiru handed her partner a towel, then set 
about drying herself off.  As she passed the towel over her own frame, 
Haruka&#39;s gaze drifted toward Michiru.  She watched, hypnotized, as the 
woman&#39;s lithe nude frame bent to towel off an extended leg.  Haruka 
noticed the way the light played on the muscles in her back, the way it 
reflected on her soft skin, the way she maintained an aura of elegance 
even when naked, something few people were capable of.

	&quot;The perfect spirit in the perfect body,&quot; Haruka whispered to 
herself, amazed.  She noticed the corners of Michiru&#39;s mouth curl up and 
blushed again, forgetting just how good her lover&#39;s hearing was.

	Haruka quickly dried off, while Michiru took her time.  As such, 
she was still working her body over with the towel when Haruka wrapped 
her arms around the woman from behind.  Michiru snuggled into the cocoon 
without a thought.

	&quot;I never feel safer than when I&#39;m in your arms,&quot; she sighed.

	&quot;We&#39;re a good fit,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;So, you showed me what 
your mouth is capable of.  Want to see what mine can do?&quot;

	&quot;I know what yours can do,&quot; she replied distantly, the edges of 
her mouth turned up.  Michiru felt Haruka gently nudging them toward the 
bedroom.  &quot;Oh, you are such a temptation.&quot;

	&quot;Give in,&quot; Haruka whispered, kissing her neck.  &quot;No one&#39;s 
looking.&quot;

	When they reached the bedroom doorway, Michiru gently pulled away.  
She took two steps, then turned gracefully and extended her hand.  
Haruka took it and allowed herself to be drawn to the bed. At the side 
of the bed, Michiru allowed Haruka to draw up close.  Their bodies 
touched.  Haruka&#39;s arms went around Michiru&#39;s waist, trapping the two of 
them together.  Michiru draped one arm around the woman&#39;s neck and felt 
along the side of Haruka&#39;s face with her other hand.

	&quot;You&#39;re so beautiful,&quot; Michiru said, her chest heaving with awe.  
&quot;You have to let me paint you some day.&quot;

	&quot;Only if you use water colors,&quot; Haruka replied, smirking.  &quot;Those 
oils are hell to wash off.&quot;

	Michiru giggled.  &quot;You&#39;re always teasing me.  You&#39;re so silly 
sometimes.&quot;

	&quot;I didn&#39;t use to be,&quot; Haruka replied, a brief flash of melancholy 
flashing through her eyes.

  	Michiru felt a sudden ache in her heart.  She pulled herself up 
Haruka&#39;s frame and pressed her lips to Haruka&#39;s.  The kiss was gentle, 
respectful at first, but suddenly exploded with all the yearning she 
suddenly felt for her lover.  Haruka responded, cradling the woman 
against her with her forearms pressed into the small of Michiru&#39;s back.  
She kissed back, trying to merge her mouth with her lover&#39;s.  Finally, 
reluctantly, their mouths parted.

	&quot;You kiss great,&quot; Michiru panted, her head swimming.  &quot;Have I ever 
told you that?&quot;

	&quot;Let me show you what else I can do,&quot; breathed Haruka.

	Ceding control of her body, Michiru allowed herself to be eased 
down onto the bed.  Haruka cuddled next to her and leaned in.  She took 
one of Michiru&#39;s swollen nipples in her mouth and lightly caressed it 
with the skin of her lips.  It was a taunting sensation, just heavy 
enough to thrill, but tantalizingly light, to make a person want more.  
Michiru felt her insides tighten and resisted the urge to squirm.

	Using the tip of her tongue, Haruka swirled around the side of the 
nipple, tracing the aureole.  Michiru didn&#39;t moan, but her quick intake 
of air was enough of a signal to continue.  As she lavished attention on 
the breast, Haruka&#39;s hand gently massaged her lover&#39;s midriff.  She 
could feel Michiru&#39;s fingers weaving through her still-wet hair.  
Michiru refused to show it, but Haruka knew the woman was enjoying this.

	&quot;Mmmmmm,&quot; Michiru murmured elegantly.  &quot;Oh, Haruka,&quot; and the words 
trailed off as her brain momentarily forgot how to speak.

	For Haruka&#39;s hand had deviously slid down her lover&#39;s abdomen and 
through the thatch of green below her waist.  A single finger was 
lightly caressing the skin in that region.  Michiru&#39;s head rolled back.  
Her cool reserve was showing cracks.  She pulled herself closer to 
Haruka, her other arm closing around the blonde&#39;s head.

	The finger penetrated.  Michiru emitted a low moan and arched 
against Haruka.  Haruka began rubbing the inner walls and Michiru became 
as helpless as jelly.

	&quot;Ohhhh!&quot; she cried.  &quot;Yes, right there!&quot;

	It was just the way she knew Michiru liked it: a slow, elegant, 
relentless build to a peak that seemed to take over every nerve ending 
in her body.  And Haruka continued, slow and relentless, while Michiru 
teetered on the brink for what seemed to her to be an eternity.  Time 
stopped, then kicked back into motion as a wave cascaded over her and 
Michiru released a cry so high-pitched that it was barely audible.  
Haruka continued for a few moments more, to cushion her return from the 
heights, then held her lover as she clung to him.  A sensation of 
wetness caused Haruka to pull back enough to look at her.

	&quot;Michiru,&quot; she said, amazed.  &quot;You&#39;re crying.&quot;

	&quot;Yes, I suppose I am,&quot; she smiled sadly.  

	&quot;Why?&quot;

	&quot;Because it was so beautiful.&quot;  She looked up and saw Haruka still 
didn&#39;t understand.  &quot;There was one time - - I was on stage in Osaka.  I 
was playing competently, but not as well as I&#39;m capable.  That is, until 
I struck this one note.  It was a B sharp and it was perfect.  And it 
was so beautiful that I just started crying right there on stage.  I 
managed to finish the performance, but it was difficult.  And I was 
crying because I had achieved perfection.  Achieving perfection kind of 
makes me emotional.&quot;

	&quot;And just now?&quot; Haruka asked.

	&quot;Um hmm.  When we&#39;re together, it&#39;s more perfect than any note I 
can play or any piece I can paint.  It&#39;s ironic.  I&#39;m Michiru Kaioh, the 
noted soloist and solitary painter, and nobody knows that my greatest 
work is a collaboration.&quot;  She caressed Haruka&#39;s cheek.  &quot;Never leave 
me.&quot;

	&quot;Not even in death,&quot; Haruka replied and kissed Michiru tenderly.
