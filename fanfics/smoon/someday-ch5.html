<h1>Someday, Hold Me Close to You (part 5 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/someday-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Well, I was hoping to have it out in about a week. I wanted to surprise 
my friend with an early copy of it.&quot; Minako said to her manager, who 
sucked his teeth in response.

&quot;Minako,&quot; he began, and Minako braced herself for another one of his 
pointless lectures. She even yawned for emphasis.

&quot;You know how I just adore your friends-especially that Mars Reiko girl- 
but there are no exceptions. Not for anyone. Other fans will grow 
jealous if they find out and think you don&#39;t care about them. We can&#39;t 
have that, now can we?&quot;

Minako wasn&#39;t in the mood for battle today. She was way too tired to 
even think of witty comebacks. Once again, Artemis&#39; incessant snoring 
had kept her awake, but so had the memory of Rei&#39;s embrace. She was 
so...warm. So comfortable in every way imaginable. When they hugged, 
Minako felt a sense of nostalgia. But why? They&#39;d never hugged before, 
let alone been that close...

&quot;Okay, manager-san. But I still want it out a week earlier&#151;for 
everyone.&quot; Minako turned away from her manager and headed straight for 
the door. She knew if she stood there any longer he&#39;d keep whining and 
bickering, mostly just so he could say he did something other than sit 
and file his nails.

&quot;Ehh... He&#39;s not so bad,&quot; Minako thought to herself. &quot;He&#39;s always there 
when I need cheering up, just like Artemis. Except he&#39;s more...human and 
I suppose &#39;feminine&#39; than Artemis. But in all reality, I wouldn&#39;t want 
him any other way.&quot;

She took a look at her watch. It read 1:30.

&quot;Only a half hour more and I can call her,&quot; she whispered to herself, a 
smile running over her lips.

&quot;And don&#39;t be offended if I miss your call. I won&#39;t be carrying my phone 
around with me, so if I get your call, I get it.&quot;

Minako&#39;s smile fell short and was instead replaced by a frown.

&quot;Maybe I should make her wait, then. If she won&#39;t really be anticipating 
my call, then there&#39;s no harm in waiting a few hours more.&quot;

She walked out to the small, black car waiting for her, a trace of 
victory in her stride.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;It feels late... Why hasn&#39;t she called me yet?&quot; Rei looked at her cell 
phone for the time. She narrowed her eyes.

&quot;It&#39;s already 4:30! Doesn&#39;t she realize that I&#39;m impatient!&quot;

She looked to the front yard of the shrine. It was COMPLETELY spotless. 
She&#39;d been up since 7 in the morning, and had run her broom over all of 
the stairs leading up to the shrine, the entrance, and the whole inside 
of the shrine. She&#39;d even tried sweeping the sidewalk, but when she 
started getting strange looks from the businessmen on their way to work, 
as well as just plain passer-by&#39;s, she decided to give up on that one.

&quot;I suppose it&#39;s my fault she hasn&#39;t called yet. I was kind of rude to 
her about it...&quot;

&quot;And don&#39;t be offended if I miss your call. I won&#39;t be carrying my phone 
around with me, so if I get your call, I get it.&quot;

&quot;She wouldn&#39;t make me wait purposely, would she? No, she&#39;s not that 
immature.&quot;

&quot;I guess you&#39;ve figured out my plan then, huh Hino-san?&quot; came a high and 
melodic voice from the stairs.

Rei turned to see Minako stepping over the last step of the shrine 
stairs, a triumphant smile plastered on her always glossy lips. 
Sometimes Rei wondered how many bottles of lip gloss Minako went through 
each month...

&quot;What are you doing here? I thought you said that you would call me.&quot; 
Rei crossed her arms and turned her eyes to the big sakura tree beside 
the garden.

Minako could tell Rei was embarrassed by the way her eyebrows were 
twitching, and the way her lips formed a perfect line. She&#39;d won this 
small, secret battle, that was for sure.

&quot;Well, I figured since you weren&#39;t going to carry around your 
phone-which was a complete lie-&quot; Minako pointed to the cell phone in 
Rei&#39;s hand. &quot;-I&#39;d just stop over to pick you up.&quot;

Rei rose her eyebrow and uncrossed her arms.

&quot;&#39;Pick me up&#39;? Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see. It&#39;s a surprise.&quot; Rei sighed.

&quot;I should expect that from you. You, Aino Minako, are just one big ball 
of surprises. But I&#39;m not going unless you tell me where this place is, 
and why we are going.&quot; Minako half-laughed and put her hands on her 
hips.

&quot;Nope!&quot;

&quot;Then I refuse to go,&quot; Rei said.

&quot;I have bodyguards, you know. They pay heed to my every whim, and if I 
wanted them to, they could pick you up, throw you over their shoulder, 
and kidnap you. You wouldn&#39;t refuse then, now would you?&quot; Minako asked, 
not even flinching at Rei&#39;s cold, hard stare.

&quot;You wouldn&#39;t.&quot; The priestess scoffed.

&quot;Well... I do know some Kung Fu. It&#39;s my exercise routine so I don&#39;t 
gain weight. I could actually pick you up and carry you out if I wanted 
to.&quot;

Rei seemed somewhat shocked, but Minako burst out into a fit of laughter 
at the mental image of her actually kidnapping Rei. Sure, the idol did 
know some Kung Fu and Tae Kwon Do, but taking down Rei? She&#39;d need some 
mental preparation for that.

&quot;Just trust me, okay? I think you&#39;ll enjoy where we&#39;re going.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rei answered flatly. Minako was getting agitated now.

&quot;I&#39;m not going to get on my knees and beg, if that&#39;s what you think I&#39;ll 
do.&quot;

Rei smirked.

&quot;Any normal person would want to know where they&#39;re going, Minako. 
You&#39;re acting as if I&#39;m being irrational, when really, you&#39;re the one 
being just that.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll make sure not to plan anything special for you ever again, then. 
You&#39;re always so miserable and grumpy anyway.&quot; Rei furrowed her 
eyebrows.

&quot;Don&#39;t expect to come to my temple to insult me and then get away with 
it.&quot;

Minako sighed.

&quot;I didn&#39;t come here for this. I thought we could actually go out and 
have fun, like normal 20-something year old girls. But apparently 
everything always has to be a battle for you. Then again, I couldn&#39;t 
expect anything less from the goddess of Mars, now could I?&quot;

Minako turned to leave when Rei grabbed her arm, much like the way 
Minako had grabbed Rei&#39;s back at the airport. But unlike Rei, Minako 
didn&#39;t pull away.

&quot;I&#39;m...sorry, I just- I&#39;ll go. But I have to get changed first. You can 
come inside if you&#39;d like,&quot; Rei said softly, this time with a genuine 
smile. Minako wanted to hug the girl again like she had the night 
before. They were so close to each other... Minako could smell the 
jasmine incense all over Rei, and it was completely intoxicating. It was 
making her feel like she should do something more, something more 
besides hug her. The next best thing of course, would be to kiss her. 
But...she couldn&#39;t. That&#39;d be crossing the line BIG TIME. She knew her 
boundaries, and for that day at least, she didn&#39;t have any plans to step 
over them.

Meanwhile, Rei was having some &#39;unusual&#39; thoughts as well.

&quot;Why is she just...staring at me? Do I...Do I have something on my 
face?&quot;

&quot;Minako? Are you alright?&quot; Rei asked out loud, her grip on Minako&#39;s arm 
tightening. The girl seriously looked like she was about to faint.

&quot;Oh,&quot; she muttered. Her eyelashes fluttered as she snapped out of her 
trance.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll wait inside. Thanks.&quot;

&quot;Wow...&quot; Minako took another glance around Rei&#39;s room. The priestess had 
so many things in that room, but everything was diversified and neat. 
There were tons of books on just about every topic (there were even 
quite a few manga), cupboards, cupboards, and more cupboards of incense, 
incense holders, and incense mixing bowls. The girl also had a wall full 
of pictures. Quite a few of them were from back in their teen-age days, 
when the senshi had been assembled. Minako felt a sense of loneliness 
creeping upon her as she scanned the pictures of all of &#39;them&#39; together, 
smiling. Something she never really got to have.

&quot;But that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. To get back the friends I was destined to 
have. Our friendships were all decided in the past life.&quot;

As she continued looking over the pictures, she noticed a picture in the 
middle, which was kept in a frame unlike the others which were simply 
tacked onto the bulletin board nailed to the wall. It was the picture 
Usagi mentioned the night she&#39;d arrived at Crown. So it was true.

&quot;He gave her two pictures. She donated one to the photo book here&quot; Usagi 
pointed to the book. &quot;And kept the other one for herself.&quot;

&quot;And it&#39;s framed,&quot; Minako whispered. The loneliness that had been 
threatening to engulf her earlier suddenly faded away, and now all that 
remained was a sense of utter content. It may have been the only picture 
of the two on Rei&#39;s wall, but it was the only framed one. Minako 
couldn&#39;t help but feel inimitable and proud.

Her eyes wandered down to the low table near Rei&#39;s bedside. On the table 
was Rei&#39;s cell phone, a small plant, and another framed picture. She 
leant down to get a better view of it. By the look of it, it was Rei 
with her family when she around 4 or 5, maybe even 6. She looked so 
uncharacteristically happy, but yet the picture wouldn&#39;t seem right 
without her smile. Leaning over behind her was probably her deceased 
mother. The two looked so much alike when they smiled, it was almost 
frightening. Next to them, or rather a foot away from them, stood a man 
in a business suit, his hands clasped together at his waist. He wasn&#39;t 
exactly glowering, but he wasn&#39;t grinning like his wife or daughter 
either. Yes, Minako could see where Rei got her stare from. Minako 
squinted her eyes to see if the crease she&#39;d imagined by the man was 
really there or not. It was.

&quot;It looks like it&#39;s been folded back a bunch of times.&quot;

&quot;My father, the politician.&quot; Minako stood to her full height and turned 
around to see Rei leaning against the doorframe, now dressed in a white, 
long-sleeved t-shirt and dark green cargo pants.

&quot;You look very much like both of your parents. Your mother was...is very 
pretty,&quot; Minako spoke, trying to be careful with her words. Rei smiled.

&quot;Yeah, she is. She was so beautiful, both on the inside and the outside. 
Too bad I&#39;m so much like my father. I&#39;d be like a mix of Ami-chan and 
Usagi-chan had I turned out like Mama. I&#39;m not so sure how those two 
could mix, but... If they could, that&#39;s her.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re the way you are,&quot; Minako replied. &quot;Ami and Usagi are 
great, but the senshi needed someone like you, even if you are 
incredibly hard-headed and competitive.&quot; Rei half-laughed and shrugged.

&quot;I&#39;m only fiercely competitive when you challenge me. Otherwise, I&#39;m 
average.&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Minako already knew what Rei&#39;s response would be, but she had 
to hear it for herself.

&quot;Because you&#39;re the only one who pisses me off so much.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m honored, really. Now let&#39;s go.&quot; Minako grabbed Rei&#39;s hand and 
pulled her toward the door.

&quot;I need my cell phone,&quot; Rei said, doing her best to escape from Minako&#39;s 
death grip on her hand. &quot;Someone here at the shrine might need me.&quot;

&quot;Not tonight, Mars Reiko-san. If I of all people am taking off from 
work, then you sure as Hell can too.&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I thought idols rode around in limos.&quot; Rei examined the car she was in, 
and took notice of how small it was. This was the complete opposite of 
what she expected celebrities to travel around in. Not to say it wasn&#39;t 
nice; it was, just...different.

&quot;If they want attention drawn to them. Usually only amateur teen-idols 
ride around in flashy black limos. It&#39;s common sense. If you don&#39;t want 
to be noticed, then don&#39;t make yourself known.&quot; Minako typed away on her 
laptop as it occasionally threatened to fall from her lap when the 
driver hit any bumps. But amazingly, Minako was unfazed by it, and 
simply kept on typing, her fingers moving at an incredible speed.

Sure, Rei used a computer every now and then. It was required at T &amp; A 
Girl&#39;s Private Catholic school Japanese classes sometimes, but to be 
able to type that fast? And while the laptop is bouncing all over the 
place? It was unnatural as far as Rei was concerned.

Just then, Rei noticed someone was missing.

&quot;Minako, where&#39;s Artemis?&quot; Minako slapped the laptop shut.

&quot;He&#39;s over at Usagi&#39;s. I knew he&#39;d take all the attention, so I had to 
drop him off,&quot; she joked. Rei smirked.

&quot;So where is this &#39;mystery place&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Oh, about another 15-20 minutes or so and we&#39;ll be there. Driver,&quot; 
Minako leant forward and the driver responded with a &quot;Hai&quot;.

&quot;I&#39;m going to put the window up, okay? Buzz me if you need me.&quot;

&quot;Yes, Ms. Aino.&quot; The driver nodded, and with that, Minako closed the 
window so that the driver was no longer visible. She slipped the laptop 
into a black carrying case and then zipped it up and placed it next to 
her, on the middle seat.

&quot;I was going to ask you to do that,&quot; Rei said with a sigh as she leant 
back onto the comfortable, black leather cushion.

&quot;Do you remember the day we met?&quot; Minako questioned suddenly. Rei sat 
back up and eyed Minako curiously.

&quot;Of course. I was visiting my mother&#39;s grave that day. We passed each 
other when the priest asked us if we could come and check out that sick 
Golden Retriever. Why?&quot;

&quot;I was so intrigued with you when you told me you had no clue who I was. 
I knew you were Sailor Mars, and that was a secret identity. But you 
didn&#39;t even know I was &#39;Aino Minako, Japan&#39;s most famous pop star&#39;.&quot;

&quot;I figured it out eventually. I don&#39;t watch television or listen to the 
radio much... I told you that.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know. You just made me feel...normal again. But at the same 
time, like all of my touring was for nothing. So of course, after we 
met, I booked my schedule completely to make sure something like that 
would never happen again,&quot; Minako stated, resolve present in her voice. 
Rei shrugged..

&quot;Well, would you have liked me to act like a crazy fan? I think Usagi 
was/is more than enough of one. You think her obsession would have toned 
down even the slightest bit since you two are actually friends now, but 
no. She still hangs your posters on her walls, dances to your music, and 
buys all of your videos you put out. She&#39;s a mother for crying out 
loud!&quot; Minako grinned and let out a dreamy sigh.

&quot;What can I say? I have that long-lasting effect on people.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s for sure,&quot; Rei replied sarcastically.

Rei looked over house she and Minako were standing in front of. It 
looked simple, plain, normal, average&#151;just plain dull. In short, she 
wondered what the heck they were doing there.

&quot;What is this?&quot;

Minako gave a slight smile in response. She began walking up to the 
house, signaling Rei to follow. Rei was hesitant, but she went along 
with it anyway. The two started walking up the small flight of stairs 
leading to the small patio, where the front door was located. Minako did 
a rhythmical knock on it, and shuffling was heard. A balding man and his 
teen-aged daughter greeted the young women happily at the door, causing 
even more confusion for Rei.

&quot;Aino-san! It&#39;s great to see you!&quot; The balding man bowed repeatedly, 
while his daughter bowed her head once. Minako grinned happily and lead 
Rei into the house. It was just as simple on the inside as it was on the 
outside, except there were papers scattered all over the dining room 
table, as well as every coffee table Rei saw. For some reason, she got a 
feeling she&#39;d met this man before, but she couldn&#39;t really recall where.

&quot;Hino-san, it&#39;s great to see you again! You&#39;ve certainly grown since the 
last time I saw you all those years ago,&quot; the man spoke, a wide grin 
spread over his face. Rei smiled politely, but it was obvious she was 
completely clueless.

&quot;Don&#39;t you remember helping these people out about 10 years ago, Hino?&quot; 
Minako asked. Rei looked the man and the young woman over again, but 
still couldn&#39;t recollect where and when she&#39;d met them. She shook her 
head from left-to-right.

&quot;Hmm. Perhaps you don&#39;t remember the day we met as well as you thought.&quot;

Rei raised an eyebrow.

&quot;What do these people have to do with that day?&quot;

Minako nodded her head at the teen-aged girl, who in reply headed out of 
the room and into another. Around 15 seconds later, she returned, this 
time with a dog. A dog which also looked strangely familiar...

&quot;Taro?&quot; Rei said to herself. Yes, of course! It all made sense! It was 
the dog that had strangely helped bring Minako and Rei together on that 
fateful day. How could she have forgotten?

Minako nodded. &quot;Yep, it&#39;s Miki.&quot; The dog immediately headed over to her 
when she spoke it&#39;s name, it&#39;s tail lazily wagging all about. The fur 
around his mouth was turned completely gray now, showing how much time 
had really gone by. He looked as if he had some trouble with walking, 
but he tried his hardest to get over to Minako, who was now squatting so 
she could scratch it&#39;s chest.

&quot;We always wanted to thank you, Hino-san, for bringing Miki into our 
lives,&quot; said the balding man. &quot;I had to work a lot at the office when 
Noriko was younger, and I didn&#39;t like leaving her without a companion 
for so many hours. But when we went to mass that morning and read the 
posters you and Aino-san had put up outside of the gate, I knew she 
wouldn&#39;t be alone for much longer. Of course a dog cannot replace a 
father, but I think it helped make her feel somewhat not alone.&quot;

&quot;Yes, father. Thank you, Hino-san.&quot; The teen-aged girl smiled politely 
and bowed. Rei smiled and bowed as well. She looked over at Minako, who 
was cooing to the dog and scratching it&#39;s belly now. She joined them and 
kneeled onto the wooden floor, which creaked under her weight. She 
rubbed the dog&#39;s back and nudged Minako.

&quot;I thought we agreed it&#39;s name would be Taro.&quot; Minako shoved her back 
and smirked.

&quot;I liked Miki better.&quot;

Rei stifled a grin. Is this really where Minako had wanted to take her 
so badly? It was almost too...sweet.</pre>
