<h1>Dreams that Won't Disappear when I Open my Eyes (part 1 of 1)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/princess.html">Princess</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Moshimoshi everyone.  I&#39;m debating making a web page
to put my stories on that will be updated more quickly than ASMR, but don&#39;t
count on it. ^-^ And one more reminder- this story is based on both anime
and manga, so there will be chunks from both. Enough rambling. On with the
story. 

Disclaimers: There&#39;s a reason why there&#39;s a banana in my ear. I&#39;m trying to
lure the monkey out of my head.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Hotaru-chan!!&quot;
        
        ChibiMoon&#39;s eyes were wide as she saw, for the first time in
forever, it seemed, the raven-haired soldier of Saturn. Strange glass youma
had attacked... and had captured all of the inner senshi. ChibiUsa had
thought they wouldn&#39;t win... when the Outer Senshi had shown up. With
Saturn.

        &quot;Hello, ChibiUsa-chan..&quot; It sounded so light, so formal, but a
shiver tremored down the pink-haired girl&#39;s spine at the melodic sound of
Hotaru&#39;s voice. She could never tire of hearing it. 

        &quot;World Shaking!&quot; &quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; &quot;Dead Scream..&quot; Sailoruranus,
Sailorneptune, and Sailorpluto shattered the demons that appeared to be made
out of mirrors. But as they began to re-form, Sailormoon and the inner
soldiers began to ask questions... when Saturn spoke.

        &quot;A crisis is approaching the Princess. We must give her our power.&quot;
With that, she simply bowed her head and a deep purple aura suddenly
radiated from her. The other guardian soldiers quickly followed suit.... and
to ChibiUsa&#39;s amazement, Sailormoon called out &quot;Moon Eternal... Make-up!&quot;
and transformed into a new uniform with.... wings?!

        &quot;This is Sailormoon&#39;s true form,&quot; Hotaru spoke once more. &quot;I have
come to tell you this.&quot;
        
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Those words echoed in ChibiUsa&#39;s mind now. Brief words, yes, but
everything Hotaru had said was played over and over in her thoughts now as
she readied for bed. She looked at herself solemnly in the mirror as she
slowly brushed out her candy-pink hair.

        What was going on? What is the new danger? Is Usagi in trouble? How
did Hotaru get big again so fast? Does she still.... care? All of these
questions rampaged unanswered in ChibiUsa&#39;s heart, and with a weary sigh she
turned off her lamp and slid into bed. Despite her troubled thoughts, she
fell into a deep, dreamless sleep as soon as her head hit the pillow.
        
        Hours later, something woke ChibiUsa. She didn&#39;t know what, or why,
she just sat with her eyes half-open, staring at the bedspread though not
really focusing on it. The Sandman&#39;s clouded dreams still hovered over her
mind, and she half-smiled, content to linger where she was rather than think
about why she was awake in the middle of the night.
        
        But this was short-lived, for a shadow fell over the bunny-dappled
bedspread, and slowly she blinked and looked up toward the window. Hotaru
sat on the open windowsill, the moonlight reflecting purple on her raven
hair. Her slender body was clothed in a simple white cotton dress that was
thin enough to pass for a nightgown. As her eyes met ChibiUsa&#39;s, she smiled.
&quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot;

        &quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa mumbled as her mind cleared. &quot;Hotaru-chan...
why... how long have you been here?&quot; She blushed a bit, realizing Hotaru
could have been watching her for some time.
        
        &quot;For a while,&quot; Hotaru answered noncommittally.

        &quot;What... were you doing?&quot; Chibiusa asked, slowly sitting up in bed.
As she did, the thick strap of the white tank-top she wore slid down her
shoulder, causing the pinky fuzzy rabbit emblazoned on the front to wrinkle.

        &quot;Watching you.&quot; Slowly Hotaru unfolded her legs that had been pulled
to her chest and stood, walking gracefully to sit on the edge of ChibiUsa&#39;s
bed, one leg pulled beneath her as she faced the pink-haired girl. &quot;It&#39;s
nice to be able to do that again. It&#39;s been so long.&quot;

        &quot;I know,&quot; ChibiUsa replied. She smiled suddenly and, to Hotaru&#39;s
surprise, threw her arms about her, laying her head on her chest as she
pulled her close. &quot;I&#39;ve missed you, Hota-chan.&quot;

        Blushing, Hotaru smiled brightly even as she felt a bit of moistness
build up in her eyes. Returning the embrace, she murmured, &quot;I&#39;ve missed you
too, ChibiUsa-chan..&quot; 

        For a few long moments they stayed in that position, lost to the
world. But ChibiUsa suddenly noticed that the softness beneath her cheek was
Hotaru&#39;s breasts... and that realization prompted her to sit up straight as
an arrow, reddish eyes wide, cheeks aflame.

        &quot;ChibiUsa...?&quot; Hotaru&#39;s eyes blinked open and then she hesitated
when she saw the look on her friend&#39;s face. They both sat, once more frozen
as a dozen emotions seemed to pass between them. It was as if they were
linked... both feeling the love, and confusion, and passion that the other
felt. 

        Hotaru&#39;s eyes suddenly closed and she leaned forward, pulling
ChibiUsa in close. For a moment ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes widened and she inhaled
sharply, but the moment Hotaru&#39;s lips touched hers a sense of calm and peace
flowed through her, and her eyes slowly closed.

        It was like no kiss she had ever received before. True, she had only
been kissed once... but it was not like this. Everything in the world seemed
to be wiped away and the only thing she knew was Hotaru... her touch, her
scent, her warmth, her love. It was overwhelming... it felt like the time at
the beach when a wave had crashed over her head and taken her under,
disorienting her until she didn&#39;t know how to come back up. But this time,
she wasn&#39;t sure she -wanted- to come back up. 

        After only a moment, though it had seemed like forever, they broke
apart and sat with their noses only inches from each other, staring into
each other&#39;s eyes. Each wondered what the other was thinking, what to do
next. It was ChibiUsa who spoke first.

        &quot;Hotaru-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa whispered breathlessly. Their was a strange
burning light in her eyes that Hotaru couldn&#39;t quite place. &quot;Hotaru... don&#39;t
leave. Stay here tonight.&quot;

        The implications of that statement took a moment to reach Hotaru&#39;s
mind. Stay... the night? She knew ChibiUsa didn&#39;t just mean an innocent
sleep-over. The thought that -ChibiUsa- would suggest such a thing astounded
her. &quot;C-ChibiUsa..&quot; she stammered, &quot;...are you, I mean.... are you
sure...?&quot;

        A firm nod was her reply. &quot;Don&#39;t leave, Hota-chan.&quot; 
        
        Hotaru blinked, watching her in silence for a moment. Right and
wrong danced in her mind- what should she do? But in the end, it was her
emotions, her heart that won.

        &quot;Okay.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        That&#39;s it for now, minna. Sorry I had to give another cliff-hanger,
but I wanted to finish it for this week and it&#39;s hard to do that with my
classes and all! More to come!
