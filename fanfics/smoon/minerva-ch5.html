----

---The Silver Millennium---

&quot;How?&quot; Yasuo, head ambassador from Neptune asked, &quot;How did this happen?&quot;

Minerva looked in shock at the smoldering remains of the emissarial 
ship. Going down to the wreck with Yasuo and two of the other 
ambassadors, they came upon two of the princess&#39; guards lying in pools 
of their own blood, seemingly dismembered by wild animals.

&quot;Great Shield!&quot; Minerva exclaimed. A bright flash of light later, a 
large round bronze-colored shield appeared on her left arm as she 
carried her royal henshin wand in her right hand.

&quot;Ambassador, stay here.&quot; she said to Yasuo before entering the still 
burning ship.

------

The satellites, set up around planet Minerva and its small moon, were 
for the detection of possible threats posed by asteroids and comets. As 
Sako rechecked the raw data coming in from the early warning system, 
chancellor Maiya entered the control room.

&quot;What is it Sako?&quot; Maiya hissed, &quot;Don&#39;t you know how busy I am?&quot;

Sako was taken aback a bit; Maiya was well known for getting along well 
with subordinates and being very giving with her time. Choosing to 
ignore her chancellor&#39;s tone, Sako gave her report.

&quot;Several very large masses have appeared out of nowhere and are baring 
straight for us, Ma&#39;am.&quot; she said, turning from her chancellor to point 
at the computer screen.

Maiya looked at the monitor as she walked up behind Sako and put her 
left hand on the young woman&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I see.&quot; she whispered, &quot;Have you had a chance to inform anyone else 
yet?&quot;

&quot;No Ma&#39;am, you&#39;re the first one I contacted.&quot;

Maiya smiled at that. Reaching around from behind, she grasped the young 
woman&#39;s throat with her right hand. Digging in with her nails, she tore 
out the younger woman&#39;s esophagus, spraying the monitor and computers 
with Sako&#39;s blood. She then grabbed her by the back of the head and 
crashed her skull through the monitor face first.

Flicking the blood from her hand, the chancellor closed her eyes.

&quot;Quit your whining.&quot; she growled, &quot;You wanted your Princess to stay, I&#39;m 
making sure she does.&quot;

She then opened her eyes and smiled as she left the room. The fleet had 
left hyperspace. It would now begin.

------

Minerva looked around at the damage as she held her shield in front of 
her, a glowing yellow orb of light extending from the shield&#39;s edges to 
surround her body. As she walked among the charred and disfigured 
remains of her guards and the emissaries, she realized that this was no 
accident. Whatever had attacked the guards had also done this.

Somewhere on planet Minerva there was a traitor.

She began to turn around when she felt the ground shudder underneath 
her. As she began to rush out of the ship, a second shockwave was felt.

&#145;An earthquake.&#39; she thought as she was seized with concern for her 
subjects. As she finally exited the craft, she learned the horrifying 
truth.

War ships. War ships stretched across the sky, launching terrible 
weapons down on her beloved planet. She could hear the explosions, and 
her people screaming to her for help.

Her people were under attack.

Why hadn&#39;t she been warned?

---South Orange Grove, Texas---

---October 13, 1946---

Jack Parsons had been stripped of his leadership role in the American 
branch of the O.T.O. He had lost power and prestige within the occult 
community who now considered him a dangerous maverick. None of his old 
friends from the Ordo Templi Orientalis would have anything to do with 
him, lest they be ostracized themselves.

A weaker man would&#39;ve been crushed by such setbacks. Parsons, however, 
no longer cared. Today was to be his triumph, his last laugh at Crowley 
and all those who&#39;d tried to bring him down. As the avatar screamed in 
pain, Parson&#39;s looked to the skies and thanked the fates.

She was in labor.

Babylon was about to be born into the world of men.

It was most unusual for a father to request to be present at the birth 
of his child. Of course, being a rocket scientist for the U.S. Military 
had its perks, and the money needed to bribe an entire maternity ward 
was one of them. He looked on as the head began to crown. This was it; 
the beginning of the new Eon of Horace Crowley was always going on 
about. Unlike Crowley however, Parson&#39;s hadn&#39;t simply waited for the new 
eon to arrive; he&#39;d forced it to come now!

The shoulders now emerged as tears of joy began to run down the magus&#39; 
cheeks. With a final scream, and an agonizing push, the child was born. 
Babylon was born!

Parsons pushed the nurses out of the way. He had to see the goddess, the 
female messiah of the new age, he...

But wait; what&#39;s this? Something went wrong. This wasn&#39;t a goddess of 
light and freedom.

What in the hell was this?

---Tokyo, the Present---

Haruka sat on the couch in Usagi&#39;s living room with her arm wrapped 
protectively around Michiru&#39;s shoulder. Those who only knew the public 
face of Tenoh Haruka, the formula-one racecar driver with the roguish 
good looks, would&#39;ve been surprised by the private woman; a warrior, 
wife and parent who was willing to sacrifice anything for those she 
cared for.

Yesterday, she&#39;d been forced to look on helplessly as Michiru was 
assaulted by something psychically. Later, she and the Outers learned 
that Rei had likewise been attacked. Both times, it had been when they 
felt a menace first and tried to reach out to discover its source.

The events of yesterday had frightened the sandy-blonde more than she 
was comfortably willing to admit. She looked over to see Hotaru sitting 
on Michiru&#39;s other side, and frowned when she thought of the fifteen 
year old having to watch her Michiru-mama go through that.

&quot;You can&#39;t be serious.&quot;

Rei&#39;s voice brought the racer back to the present.

&quot;I can&#39;t simply ignore something like this. Whatever this menace is...&quot;

&quot;Nearly took out both you and Michi-chan.&quot; Makoto interrupted. &quot;If we 
hadn&#39;t been there to help you combat it, what do you think would&#39;ve 
happened?&quot;

&quot;But, to simply ignore a threat?&quot; Michiru asked, &quot;To intentionally not 
try to investigate...&quot;

&quot;Michi, please.&quot; Ami said, &quot;Whatever it is will show itself soon 
enough.&quot;

Minako nodded, &quot;The first time the two of you tried to investigate, Rei 
fell into a mini-coma and your mirror went black. And this last time... 
Michi-chan, we don&#39;t want to lose you or Rei.&quot;

Haruka frowned. What Michiru and Rei were being asked to do, 
intentionally ignore a threat until it showed itself, went against 
everything the two Senshi stood for. And yet...

And yet she still could remember holding her wife&#39;s shaking body as the 
shorter woman coughed up blood.

&quot;Ruka?&quot; Michiru asked as she looked into Haruka&#39;s handsome green eyes, 
&quot;Ruka, what do you think?&quot;

The Senshi of the Winds didn&#39;t know what to say. They were asking Michi 
and Rei to cave into a bully who was attacking them from a distance, but 
at the same time what if next time the two women were alone? She&#39;d once 
been willing to sacrifice anything, including not only her own life but 
even Michiru&#39;s as well, in order to save the earth from evil. Things 
were no longer so simple. She was now a wife and a parent.

With a sigh, she turned away from her wife&#39;s deep blue eyes to look at 
Usagi.

&quot;Odango, I... I can no longer give an objective opinion.&quot; she admitted 
in front of everyone, &quot;As the future ruler of Crystal Tokyo, I bow to 
your decision.&quot;

Usagi was taken aback. She looked at her fellow Senshi in the room, and 
swallowed hard.

&quot;For now,&quot; she said finally, &quot;We do nothing. At least for the moment. 
Whatever&#39;s out there will lower its guard eventually. And when it 
does...&quot;

A small beeping sound interrupted her. Everyone looked over to Setsuna 
who was pulling her cell phone out of her purse. She turned her back to 
the group as she answered it.

------

Saito Kihomi arrived home an hour ago. After yet another series of 
exhaustive tests, the doctors again admitted defeat at what could be 
causing the young woman&#39;s problems. She didn&#39;t dare tell them about the 
voices. The last thing she needed as a teacher was for word to possibly 
get around that she was nuts. After the first attack she&#39;d been 
frightened. Now, she was frustrated and angry.

What was most annoying was the fact that there was no precedent for what 
was happening to her. She&#39;d never had anything like this occur to her 
before. And the timing was awful. She was in her first year as a teacher 
and had just met an attractive woman...

Setsuna!

With a start, she realized she hadn&#39;t called Hotaru&#39;s adoptive mother 
yet. Temporarily forgetting her health scare, she pulled out the slip of 
paper she&#39;d given her and stared at the number. Taking a few deep 
breaths she worked up the courage and dialed the number.

------

&quot;Hello?&quot; Setsuna said into the phone. &quot;What? Kihomi who? Oh, Kihomi!&quot; 
she said with a start, &quot;Yes, I&#39;m fine, yourself? Tonight? Hold on.&quot; she 
said placing her hand over the phone. She turned around to see everyone 
in the room staring at her inquiringly. Hotaru spoke up first.

&quot;Is it Saito-sensei?&quot; the young Senshi of Death asked.

&quot;Yes it is.&quot; she admitted as she felt herself blush under everyone&#39;s 
looks. Turning to Michiru, her face fell a bit. &quot;Michi-chan, if you need 
me to cancel my... my date tonight, I...&quot;

Michiru shook her head adamantly. &quot;No way. I&#39;ll be fine. Hotaru and Ruka 
will be here, and the others will only be a phone call away. Go, and 
have a wonderful time.&quot;

Setsuna smiled warmly at her friend, then lifted her hand off the phone, 
&quot;Yes, tonight&#39;s still on. Where? I know the perfect place. It&#39;s a 
traditional Japanese restaurant near the movie theater in Kioicho. Yes, 
that&#39;s the one. Don&#39;t worry about that; I asked you out to dinner, 
therefore the meals on me. And I have more than enough to cover the 
expenses. You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;ll see you tonight then at the restaurant. 
Goodbye.&quot;

After the phone call, she folded up her cell phone and put it back in 
her purse. She then turned to the faces of her friends and smiled 
sheepishly.

&quot;Well...&quot; Setsuna began awkwardly, &quot;I suppose you&#39;re all wondering about 
my phone call.&quot;

Minako spoke up first.

&quot;Details.&quot; the Senshi of Love demanded, &quot;Now.&quot;

------

&quot;What do you mean &#39;delayed&#39;?&quot; Beniko asked Professor Miyagawa. The 
scientist looked from the shapely blond to her silent red-haired 
partner, and sighed.

&quot;Look, you made the ritual end early, causing me to shut down the 
machine too soon. The sudden stop burned out some of the coils. It&#39;ll be 
at least ten o&#39;clock by the time I&#39;ve got the repairs done and can have 
it up and running again.&quot;

Marika buried her head in her hand in frustration, allowing a grunt of 
annoyance to escape. Beniko put a hand on her shoulder to calm her down, 
feeling a slight tinge at the way her partner&#39;s leather jacket moved 
beneath her fingers.

&quot;Very well, Professor.&quot; the blond finally said, &quot;Fix it. We need it up 
and running by tonight. We only have three nights left.&quot; she said as she 
and Marika left the warehouse. The professor watched them leave, and 
then began work on his machine.

---That Evening---

Kihomi stood nervously outside the restaurant, hoping she had everything 
together. She&#39;d been to the beauty salon earlier and had her brown hair 
up in a French braid. She wore a dark evening coat over her light blue 
blouse and white slacks. A pair of tan pumps completed her ensemble. She 
looked at her watch and breathed a sigh of relief. No attacks. Whatever 
it was must have gone away.

&quot;Kihomi?&quot;

The young teacher turned to see Setsuna wearing a light gray coat over a 
short green evening gown, her long legs ending in black high-heeled 
pumps.

Both women stared admiringly at each other for a few seconds before 
Setsuna broke the silence.

&quot;So... Are you ready for dinner?&quot; she asked. Kihomi smiled warmly.

&quot;Of course.&quot; she said. Reaching the door first, she held the door open 
for Setsuna before following her in.

------

&quot;So,&quot; Michiru said as she watched the television next to Haruka, &quot;How do 
you think they&#39;re doing?&quot;

&quot;Depends.&quot; Haruka answered. Hotaru, sitting in another chair, looked 
over at her.

&quot;Depends on what Haruka-papa?&quot;

&quot;On how much of a lady your teacher is, and how much self defense your 
Setsuna-mama remembers. Oof!&quot; she let out as Michiru elbowed her.

------

&quot;A fashion designer?&quot; Kihomi asked.

Setsuna blushed, &quot;I want to be one, but it&#39;s a hard industry to get 
into. I&#39;ll probably try to apprentice to someone who already has a name, 
then hopefully get my own designs made.&quot;

&quot;Well, I can certainly see that you have fashion sense. You look 
stunning tonight.&quot;

Setsuna&#39;s eyes widened at that. She&#39;d received compliments from her 
friends of course; but hearing the woman sitting across from her say it 
felt different somehow. She looked away from her date and looked down 
toward her unopened menu.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Kihomi asked. Setsuna swallowed hard and looked back up 
at her.

&quot;I&#39;m... I&#39;m a bit scared.&quot; she admitted.

The teacher tilted her head a bit. &quot;Scared? Of me?&quot;

Setsuna nodded. &quot;I&#39;ve never dated a girl before.&quot; she said, which was a 
half truth; she&#39;d never dated anyone before. &quot;I don&#39;t know what to say 
or how to act, or...&quot; her voice trailed off as her date reached across 
the table to rest her hand on top of hers.

Kihomi could still remember her first time going out with a woman. 
They&#39;d both been drunk, the sex was horrible, and she woke up the next 
day with a hangover and feeling dirty. She was determined that the woman 
sitting across from her wouldn&#39;t look back on tonight&#39;s date the same 
way she looked back on that one.

&quot;Okay Setsuna; first of all, relax. I&#39;m not going to jump you or try 
anything. Right now we&#39;re just two women who find one another attractive 
and who are sharing a meal together. I find you to be a fascinating, 
warm, and intelligent woman whom I&#39;d like to get to know better. If you 
feel nervous about going any further than that, then we don&#39;t have to go 
any further yet.&quot;

Setsuna looked into Kihomi&#39;s eyes and smiled; her date was letting her 
set the pace. &quot;Thank you.&quot; she said, &quot;I... I&#39;d like to get to know you 
better too.&quot;

Kihomi felt herself melt under Setsuna&#39;s smile. &quot;Wonderful. Well, shall 
we look at our menus?&quot;

A half an hour later the waitress delivered two plates of sashimi as 
Setsuna continued to giggle at one of Kihomi&#39;s anecdotes. The teacher 
and she found that they both shared a love for history (of course, as 
Sailor Pluto, Setsuna had seen most of it first hand from the timegate) 
as well as a similar taste in literature. Michiru and Haruka had given 
Setsuna permission to tell her that the racecar driver was a woman and 
they were a gay couple, and she had talked a bit about her family life. 
Kihomi had responded with stories of her childhood and the crazy antics 
she and her friends used to get into.

It was a story about a kid at her school who had called her a rezu 
(dyke), and how she&#39;d retaliated by sneaking into his shop class after 
school with a jar of Gorilla Glue to stick a table he&#39;d spent three 
weeks making to the ceiling that had the Time Senshi laughing.

As her date finally stopped laughing, Kihomi broke her chopsticks apart 
and took a bite.

&quot;You know,&quot; she said after swallowing, &quot;You have a very cute laugh.&quot;

Setsuna looked at her date a bit surprised. Cute? It was not usually a 
word associated with the Senshi of Time.

&quot;Thanks.&quot; she said, blushing a bit. Kihomi noted the sudden pink tinge 
to Setsuna&#39;s cheeks and smiled. It had taken a while to draw the young 
woman out, but now that she had she found Setsuna to be a wonderful 
table companion.

&quot;So, do you have any humorous stories about your friends?&quot; Kihomi asked 
conspiratorially, &quot;I mean, I&#39;ve been telling you about some of my 
adventures from my misspent youth, surely you&#39;ve got some humorous 
stories you could tell.&quot;

Setsuna thought about it. She&#39;d never been known as one with a quick 
joke or wry story. But then she thought about a certain blond who would 
one day rule Crystal Tokyo, and a wide smile lit up her face.

------

Rei frowned. It was happening again. She was a Sailor Senshi, a defender 
of the earth. How could she just ignore what she knew was a threat to 
all of them.

&quot;You&#39;re feeling it again, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Makoto asked. The young woman was 
staying at the temple with the priestess to keep an eye on her.

Rei nodded. &quot;It&#39;s bad, whatever it is. I hate this, Mako-chan. I feel so 
helpless.&quot;

Makoto put an understanding hand on her shoulder. &quot;I know.&quot; she said 
sympathetically, &quot;I know.&quot;

------

&quot;But I can&#39;t just sit here!&quot; Michiru protested. She was about to argue 
further when Haruka stroked her hair and gave her a sad look.

&quot;Michi-chan, please.&quot; she said in a tone Michiru had only rarely heard 
from her wife, &quot;You&#39;re... You&#39;re everything to me. I can&#39;t watch you 
suffer like that again, unable to help you, unable to take away the 
pain. It&#39;ll only be for a little while, just until we have a handle of 
what we&#39;re up against. Please.&quot; she added in a pleading tone.

Michiru looked at her wife in silence. The blond usually kept everything 
so bottled up, only showing a cool exterior, that to find out the extent 
seeing her suffering had hurt Haruka surprised her a bit.

&quot;O... Okay.&quot; she finally conceded, &quot;For now.&quot;

Haruka smiled sadly as she embraced the Senshi of the Seas.

Elsewhere in Tokyo, chanting could be heard over the low hum of a large 
machine in a warehouse.

------

The two women laughed jovially as they walked out into the parking lot.

&quot;So then what happened?&quot; Kihomi asked, listening to her date&#39;s story.

&quot;Well... Well then Usagi, whose job it was to give Haruka the ring to 
put on Michiru&#39;s finger, she... she...&quot; Setsuna began to laugh 
uncontrollably as she thought back to the event she was recounting. &quot;She 
put the ring on her own finger so she wouldn&#39;t forget or lose it. So the 
time comes, Ruka turns to Usagi to get Michi&#39;s ring, and... and... and 
Usagi couldn&#39;t get it off her finger!&quot; she said before both she and 
Kihomi began laughing uncontrollably. As they laughed, Kihomi put her 
hand on Setsuna&#39;s shoulder, leaning a bit toward her as she did so. 
Setsuna put her arm around the other woman, pulling her in a bit closer 
as they continued to laugh.

Kihomi turned to Setsuna as she slowly stopped laughing. The Senshi of 
Time slowly calmed down as she likewise turned to her date. Smiling, the 
teacher reached over to cup Setsuna&#39;s cheek in her hand. The fashion 
designer could feel her heart beat faster as the woman leaned forward to 
kiss her, gently pressing her lips to Setsuna&#39;s.

Setsuna closed her eyes as Kihomi brought her other hand up as well, 
cradling the Senshi&#39;s face in her hands. As Setsuna lost herself in the 
moment her date breathed in her perfume, noting with satisfaction that 
she had worn the same scent as when she met her with her family the day 
before.

At last separating their lips, Kihomi kept her hands on the slightly 
shorter woman&#39;s face as she stroked her cheeks with her thumbs.

&quot;So,&quot; she said in a low tone, &quot;How did that feel?&quot;

Setsuna felt warm all over. The kiss had been sweet and tender, just as 
Kihomi herself had been all throughout the date. She looked at her date, 
at her mesmerizing grey eyes and kind face, and smiled fondly as she 
brought her own arms around the teacher.

&quot;Nice.&quot; she said, finally breaking the awkward silence. &quot;It... It felt 
nice.&quot;

Kihomi returned the smile. &quot;I&#39;m glad.&quot; she answered, quickly adding, &quot;We 
don&#39;t have to go any further tonight if you don&#39;t want to. I...&quot; Kihomi 
was cut off as Setsuna herself initiated a second kiss. Caught a bit off 
guard, she soon joined in. As she felt Setsuna&#39;s arms tighten a bit 
around her, she decided to take a chance and open her mouth just a 
crack. After a few seconds, her date followed suit and likewise opened 
her mouth a bit.

Cautiously, Kihomi slid the tip of her tongue into Setsuna&#39;s mouth.

Almost immediately she felt Setsuna tense up. Kihomi began to fear she 
may have jumped the gun, until she felt her date&#39;s tongue tentatively 
touching her own. She slowly slid her tongue in a bit further as she put 
her right hand behind the Senshi&#39;s head.

Setsuna let out a soft moan as Kihomi began to encircle her tongue with 
her own. She&#39;d been alone so long, without someone to share her heart 
with, and always putting duty first. She thought of Michiru&#39;s words now, 
that no one was meant to be alone, as she continued to embrace her date. 
She now knew what it was like to feel another holding her, touching her, 
caring for her. She hoped tonight never had to end.

Unfortunately, that&#39;s when she felt it.

It went surging through her being, bringing her back down to earth. She 
reluctantly pushed herself away from the embrace.

Kihomi felt her pull back, pushing away from her. She looked into her 
date&#39;s violet eyes seeking an explanation.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Setsuna said sadly, &quot;I have to go.&quot;

Kihomi could feel a sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. &quot;What did 
I do wrong?&quot; she asked, hurt and confused. &quot;Did I push you too fast, 
or...&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Setsuna said as she felt the second surge ten seconds after the 
first, &quot;You didn&#39;t do anything wrong. I can&#39;t explain, but please 
believe me, I...&quot; a third jolt ran through her, and she turned and ran 
to find a place to transform.

Kihomi watched her run off before turning back toward her car. Reaching 
the small vehicle, she took out her keys to unlock the door and got in. 
Sitting in the driver&#39;s seat, she leaned her forehead against the 
steering wheel and let out a groan.

&quot;Shit.&quot; she muttered, &quot;What just happened?&quot;

Before she could wallow any further in self-pity, her head began 
throbbing in pain again. She began to whimper as she realized what was 
going to come next

&quot;Join us.&quot;

&quot;Hasten the Manifestation.&quot;

&quot;Join us.&quot;

She closed her eyes tightly as she wept, the pain and the voices coming 
together to create a symphony of pain. Opening her eyes, she looked in 
the rearview mirror.

There, standing behind the car, was a nude man slowly cutting himself 
with a knife.

&quot;Join us.&quot; he mouthed.

Clutching the sides of her head, she turned to look out the rear window. 
No one was there. Turning back to the front windshield she saw a 
different nude man holding a large sword, with a woman on either side of 
him cutting themselves with small blades. He raised the sword and 
pointed it at her.

&quot;You dare not refuse!&quot; he shouted just before he and the women 
disappeared.

Allowing a final cry of pain to escape, Kihomi slipped off into 
unconsciousness.</pre>
