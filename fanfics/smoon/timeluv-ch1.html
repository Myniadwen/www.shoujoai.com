<h1>No Time for Love (part 1 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: This is a bit of a long story that involves a character 
of my own making, Kira. It&#39;s not really self-insertion cause&#39; Kira isn&#39;t 
like me at all, but I&#39;d like to be her. Anyway, only two of the chapters 
are adult and I&#39;ll mark them ahead of time kay? Otherwise, enjoy!


Setsuna sighed as she watched Haruka playfully arm-wrestle their young 
daughter. The blond-haired senshi was seemingly losing and Hotaru was 
eating it up. Michiru looked on, amused by her lover&#39;s antics. Setsuna 
knew that Haruka wasn&#39;t actually losing. She could out wrestle any of 
the senshi and most of the women and men in the entirety of Japan. She 
knew that Hotaru was also aware of the fact. Despite her young age, she 
was quite grown up and well beyond such silly games. Or so Setsuna 
thought. Hotaru finally succeeded in pushing her &#39;papas&#39; arm to the 
table and was cheered by Michiru. Having lost, Haruka sagged against 
Michiru, playfully whimpering as Hotaru taunted her. As Hotaru danced 
Michiru ruffled Haruka&#39;s hair and gave her a quick kiss. Reassuring her 
that even though she&#39;d lost to their 11 year old daughter, she had 
scored major brownie points. 

It was that particular sight which had caused Setsuna&#39;s rather deep and 
lamenting sigh. Having to live with the most lovey-dovey romantic couple 
the senshi had ever and would ever see could take it&#39;s toll on you. 
Added with the mushy seen in front of her came her futuristic knowledge 
of each of the other scouts. She knew eventually, they would each find 
their own soulmate and be just as lovey-dovey. And she, would remain 
alone. Granted, she hadn&#39;t looked up her own future and did her best to 
avoid seeing things that had anything to do with her personal life so 
she didn&#39;t technically know for sure that she would be alone. But with 
each of the senshi effectively taken out of the picture, and a very few 
amount of other immortals to choose from, logic dictated that her 
future was not a happy one. Even her young daughter, the senshi of 
death and destruction, had a future filled with mushy holidays and much 
snuggling. With the pink-haired daughter of the Queen of love no less! 
Setsuna sighed again and turned to look out the window. The phone rang 
and Hotaru bounded over to it, still high from her victory.

&quot;Hello?... Hi Minako-san! Guess what? I just beat Haruka-papa at arm-
wrestling!... No she didn&#39;t let me win! I did it all by myself!&quot; Setsuna 
smiled as she watched Hotaru talk elatedly into the phone drawing 
similar smiles from the other two parents. &quot; When?...Now?...I dunno, 
I&#39;ll ask.&quot; Hotaru turned to them and addressed all three at once. 
&quot;Haruka-papa, Michiru-mama, Setsuna-mama, Minako-san wants to know if 
we want to go over to Rei-san&#39;s and have dinner with everyone.&quot; Setsuna 
smiled at the request. After the last battle with Sailor Galaxia, Usagi 
had decided that she wasn&#39;t close enough to her friends and insisted on 
regular get-togethers. Usually at Rei&#39;s and much to the priestess&#39;s 
annoyment as Usagi never helped to clean up. Exchanging quick glances, 
all three parents nodded and Hotaru related the information. She hung 
up and beamed at them.

&quot;I&#39;ll go get my coat!&quot; She announced and ran off. Setsuna grinned and 
stood to get her own coat. Haruka and Michiru did the same, standing in 
unison much to Setsuna&#39;s internal annoyment. Hotaru bounded back down 
the hall, coat in tow, and together they walked out the door.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minako grinned as she hung up the phone.

&quot;They&#39;re on their way.&quot; She announced and Usagi cheered. She danced 
around and Rei snorted.

&quot;You just want to see Haruka-san!&quot; She taunted and Usagi turned to stick 
her tongue out.

&quot;Nuh-uh! I have Mamo-chan! You want to see Haruka-san!&quot; 

&quot;Nuh-uh!&quot;

&quot;Uh-huh!&quot; Ami sighed as yet another raspberry fight started.

&quot;That&#39;s the third one tonight.&quot; Makoto said as she sat down across from 
Ami.

&quot;Fourth.&quot; Ami corrected. &quot;They had one before you got here.&quot; Makoto 
sweat-dropped and Ami nodded her agreement, as humorous as it was, 
sometimes the sheer number of fights they had was ridiculous. The fight 
came to an abrupt halt as a knock on the door sounded.

&quot;Yay! They&#39;re here!&quot; Usagi cried out and ran over to the door.

&quot;That was fast.&quot; Minako said. &quot;I just called.&quot;

&quot;With Haruka-san driving?&quot; Makoto offered and they all sighed. Usagi 
opened the door and there stood a single figure who was almost as tall 
as Haruka.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, are you lost?&quot; Usagi asked and the figure shook her head.

&quot;Are you hear for the shrine&#39;s services? I&#39;m a priestess here. Can I 
help you?&quot; Rei asked and walked up to stand next to Usagi.

&quot;Perhaps you can.&quot; The figure, a girl, spoke in a soft voice and lifted 
her head to meet Rei&#39;s eyes. Neither moved for several moments and 
Makoto and Ami stood. 

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; Usagi asked quietly, touching her friend on the shoulder. 
Rei didn&#39;t move and Makoto and Ami moved closer. The girl turned and 
looked at Usagi, meeting her eyes just as she&#39;d done with Rei. Usagi 
seemed transfixed and blanked out. Now really nervous Makoto moved a 
bit in front of Ami and into a fighting stance. Minako stood just behind 
her.

&quot;No need for that.&quot; The girl said in a soft voice and stared at Makoto 
as she walked into the room. Makoto, who had been moving forward, froze 
and blanked just as Rei and Usagi had done. Ami and Minako moved quickly 
to pull out their wands but the girl shot across the room faster than 
Ami had thought possible. She put a finger under Minako&#39;s chin and 
lifted her head. At the same time she touched Ami&#39;s shoulder and Ami 
found the suddenly moving didn&#39;t seem all that important. Once Minako 
had frozen like the others, the girl lifted Ami&#39;s head and met her 
eyes. Ami whimpered as she stared into ice-blue eyes and felt her body 
stop moving and go numb. The girl smiled and stepped away from her. 

&quot;Sit.&quot; She commanded and Ami found herself, and the other girls, walking 
to the couch and sitting down. Their eyes were clear now and reflected 
the same fear that Ami&#39;s did. Once they had all sat down the girl 
laughed and pulled down the hood that had masked her face. She was about 
as young as they were, quite pretty, with short red hair but something 
about her was off. Aside from her ability to freeze them she had this 
aura around her, and it chilled them to the bone. &quot;Now, now.&quot; She chided 
in a melodic voice. &quot;Don&#39; t look so scared. I don&#39;t plan on hurting you 
lovely little ladies. In fact, I&#39;m going to help you. Two of you to be 
exact.&quot; She smiled at Ami and Rei who were sitting on one side of the 
couch. Despite the momentary panic, Ami relaxed marginally realizing 
that if it was her and Rei she wanted, then she wasn&#39;t after Usagi or 
the Millennium Crystal. The girl opened her mouth to talk again then 
shut it and cocked her head to the side. After a few mo ments of silence 
the sound of a car could be heard. &quot;It seems we&#39;re going to have 
company. Be good now.&quot; She ordered and went to stand just behind the 
door seeming to blend into the shadows. The girls had no choice but to 
sit still.

Outside, Setsuna was stepping out of Haruka&#39;s car, greatful as always to 
have survived a trip with Haruka behind the wheel. Haruka and Michiru 
had started on the path to the house and Setsuna looked to Hotaru. The 
young girl was frozen, staring at the house. 

&quot;Hotaru-chan?&quot; She questioned but the girl didn&#39;t say a word. Setsuna 
looked up at the shrine but couldn&#39;t see anything wrong. Haruka and 
Michiru, realizing that there was a problem, now joined Setsuna.

&quot;Hotaru-chan, what is it?&quot; Michiru asked, kneeling beside her.

&quot;Something is off.&quot; She said and Setsuna felt a chill run through her. 

&quot;What? Where?&quot; Haruka demanded, her hand already going for her wand.

&quot;Up there. In the house. Something... something isn&#39;t right.&quot; She said 
and focused on Setsuna. The green-haired women nodded and pulled out her 
own wand. In less than a minute, the outer senshi stood in full dress. 
Setsuna and Hotaru made their way up the steps and Haruka and Michiru 
made for the back. As they walked up the steps Setsuna wracked her brain 
for information. She had no idea what Hotaru was worried about and that 
scared her. She always knew about important things. She&#39;d even known 
about Sailor Galaxia, but whatever had Hotaru so bothered wasn&#39;t 
registering and that freaked her out. She used the edge of her staff to 
knock on the door but no one answered. She and Hotaru nodded at each 
other and she slowly opened the door. There weren&#39;t any bodies strewn 
across the floor which was usually a good thing . Nor was there any 
blood, damage, or any sign of struggle. She and Hotaru stepped fully 
into the room and then spotted the girls, all sitting down on the couch. 
It seemed anti-climatic save for the absolute fear in their eyes. Each 
looked absolutely frantic as Hotaru rushed forward to untie them. Much 
to her surprise there were no ropes. As she searched, Setsuna took 
another step forward and looked into Ami&#39;s eyes. They kept looking at 
something ...behind her? She spun just in time to watch a figure drop 
from the ceiling. It stood and turned out to be a girl who met her 
eyes. Setsuna froze and not just because of the girl&#39;s paralyzing 
abilities. Her heart constricted and she felt tears prick the back of 
her eyes as she stared at the girl in front of her. She uttered a single 
word before she was frozen completely.

&quot;Kira-chan.&quot; The girl started at her name and stepped closer, examining 
Setsuna. Inwardly, Setsuna realized that Kira would not be able to 
recognize her as a senshi, if she remembered her at all.

&quot;How do you know my name senshi?&quot; She demanded and Setsuna almost 
whimpered at the sound of her voice. It didn&#39;t surprise her that Kira 
knew they were senshi but they had no time to finish the conversation. 
Hotaru ran past Setsuna and Kira jumped back. Setsuna almost sighed. She 
knew very well that Kira could take her out, as well as Haruka and 
Michiru if she&#39;d trained at all in the past thousand years. * Kami-sama. 
Has it really been that long? * she asked herself. But indeed it had 
been. Since before the fall of the Millennium Kingdom. Kira had already 
captured Hotaru, holding her in what seemed like a hug. Setsuna watched 
as Hotaru went limp and the straightened, now under her spell. 
Satisfied, Kira released her and walked back over to Setsuna. &quot;I asked 
you how you knew my name. You can talk now.&quot; Setsuna felt the power on 
her voice drop but her throat was still tight and her mouth dry. Kira 
frowned and went to step closer then cocked her head. &quot;Didn&#39;t four of 
you get out of the car?&quot; Timing was everything and Haruka and Michiru 
had it down. They choose that exact moment to burst through the back 
door . They charged but stood no chance. Using her super-human speed, 
Kira grabbed Michiru and took her across the room giving her enough 
time to paralyze her before Haruka got to them. A few more twists and 
Haruka was as motionless as the others. Kira pointed to the couch and 
they all walked and joined Ami, Makoto, Minako, Usagi, and Rei. 

&quot;My my. What are the senshi doing here? Surly I&#39;m not a big enough 
threat to warrant all of you?&quot; Kira taunted and no-one moved. Kira sighed 
and now addressed Setsuna again. &quot;You. I asked you before how you know my 
name. Answer!&quot; Still, Setsuna said nothing. Most humans would have 
talked by now, and Setsuna could certainly feel the pull to tell her 
everything but being a senshi had it&#39;s ups and resisting demons was one 
of them. Instead she sat, able only to gape in wonder at the woman 
before her. Kira sighed. &quot;Oh well. Not a big deal. But honestly, what 
are the senshi doing here? Unless... No! You guys are senshi too?&quot; Kira 
giggled and leaned over Ami. &quot;Let&#39;s see there&#39;s supposed to be a pocket 
somewhere here...&quot; Ami whimpered as Kira pulled out her wand in 
triumph. &quot;You are a senshi! Mercury by the symbol right? Wow. This&#39;ll 
make you taste even better.&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes widened as did the others and 
Kira laughed. &quot;Geese, calm down. I&#39;m no cannibal. Taste like this. &quot; 
She said and opened her mouth allowing gleaming fangs to show. Setsuna 
shuddered remembering the feel of the sharp teeth teasing her neck and 
watched Ami shudder to. Though not for the same reason. &quot;See? I&#39;m a 
vampire. And relax, I wasn&#39;t planning on killing you. If I wanted you 
dead, you would be already. It&#39;s more beneficial to keep you alive. 
Especially now that I know you&#39;re a senshi. You&#39;re lucky I&#39;m such a nice 
girl. Do you know how much you&#39;d each be worth where I come from? 
Especially the Princess. I mean, that you&#39;re all alive is incredible.&quot; 
They all looked clueless and Kira gr inned. &quot;Vampires are immortal you 
know. I was around before the Kingdom went ku-put. Everyone thought you 
were all dead. Granted, most people I knew were thrilled by the idea. 
So, for you all to be alive, I&#39;m guessing you were re-incarnated. So, 
let&#39;s see who you all are.&quot; Setsuna watched as she removed each girls 
wand and set them down in a pile on the table behind her.

&quot;So, the princess was re-incarnated too huh? What about your mom?&quot; Usagi 
ducked her eyes and Kira nodded. &quot;I didn&#39;t think so. Now, about you 
guys. How to get you to detransform...&quot; Setsuna whimpered in the back of 
her throat. If they de-transformed, Kira might recognize her. &quot;But 
there is a problem. There&#39;s too many of you. Unless, the &#39;crown price&#39; 
was re-incarnated as a girl? That would explain it. So, who is it?&quot; She 
reached out and pulled away Haruka&#39;s wand. She grinned and Haruka 
appeared in normal clothes again . &quot;You&#39;re Uranus. Nice, maybe I should 
take you too. The Outers were supposed to be powerful and I haven&#39;t had 
a good fight in decades. Besides, you&#39;re pretty hot.&quot; Haruka just 
growled and Kira laughed. She walked and put the wand with the others 
then returned and pulled away Michiru&#39;s. &quot;Neptune. A true pleasure I 
assure you.&quot; She grinned and again, put it with the others. She faced 
Setsuna and Hotaru. &quot;So it must be one of you. Let&#39;s try you first 
little one. You have a lot of strength coming off of you.&quot; She pulled 
away Hotaru&#39;s wand and her jaw dropped as she looked at it. &quot;Saturn? 
You&#39;re Sailor Saturn? You&#39;re not supposed be alive. Hot damn. No wonder 
you have so much power. That would explain it. But you&#39;re just a kid.&quot; 
Hotaru glared. &quot;Too bad you&#39;re not older. The harbinger of Death? I 
can&#39;t imagine a taste sweeter.&quot; She grinned as she talked and forced 
Hotaru&#39;s head up. &quot;I could always take you with me now and wait till 
you grow up. If I were an evil vampire, I&#39;d just take you right here. 
Witnesses or no. I know many who&#39;d consider you worth so much more as 
an innocent child.&quot; She whispered the last line as she stared into 
Hotaru&#39;s eyes. Haruka strained against the paralysis and Kira pulled 
away and laughed. &quot;Calm down. I said if. I&#39;m not that bad. &quot; She grinned 
and turned to Setsuna. &quot;Now, for you. Let&#39;s see who you really are and 
find out why a senshi knows who I am. &#39;Crown Prince&#39;, or Pluto?&quot; 
Setsuna&#39;s heart rate went through the roof as Kira pulled her wand away. 
She turned to place it with the others as Setsuna felt herself return 
to human form. Kira turned back, a smile on her face, and absolutely 
froze when she saw Setsuna. Her jaw dropped and her eyes widened and 
she looked like she was going to cry. The rest of the girls were 
absolutely clueless and looked between Setsuna and Kira. Kira walked 
slowly up to Setsuna and kneeled so they were face to face. Shivering 
she hesitantly reached a hand out and stroked the side of her face. It 
took every ounce of will-power Setsuna had not to lean into the touch.

&quot;Setsuna-chan?&quot; She whispered and Setsuna had to swallow her tears at 
the sound of her same. &quot;Setsuna-chan, is that really you?&quot; Kira just 
stared in awe at her and Setsuna wasn&#39;t doing much more. The others 
were looking to each for answers but no one knew anything. &quot;How are 
you...I mean, what are you... I mean, you&#39;re a senshi?&quot; Setsuna 
swallowed hard. &quot;I don&#39;t get it. If, if you&#39;re a senshi, why, why did 
you... why did you leave? You&#39;re immortal too right? So, why did you 
leave?&quot; Her voice had risen in level and Setsuna averted her eyes as a 
tear slipped from Kira&#39;s.

&quot;The law.&quot; She whispered out and Kira pulled back like she&#39;d been shot.

&quot;The law? What law...?&quot; She stood and took several steps back as it hit 
her. &quot;The law. You left, because of that?&quot; She looked angry now and 
Setsuna kept her gaze down. &quot;Answer me dammit! Is that why you left?!&quot; 
Setsuna swallowed everything. Every bit of pain and fear she had in her 
and looked up into the face of the only woman she&#39;d ever truly been in 
love with.

&quot;I&#39;m a senshi first.&quot; She said, just above a whisper and Kira stepped 
back again. She sat down hard on the table behind her.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it. This whole time, this whole time! I thought you 
actually gave a damn! I thought that I&#39;d meant something to you! I kicked 
myself everyday after you left. Every day! Even now, a thousand years 
later! Cursing myself for being immortal. I thought that somehow, 
maybe, if I could just stop, that you&#39;d come back. I can&#39;t believe you 
left because of that, because of her!&quot; With that Kira stood and snarled, 
she lifted Usagi up by her shoulders and growled. &quot;You! It&#39;s your 
mother&#39;s fault. Her and her dammed law! I never believed what everyone 
said. How we were all better off with out her, but I do now.&quot; Usagi 
whimpered and Kira went vampiric fully allowing her eyes to glow and 
her fangs to gleam.

&quot;Stop!&quot; Setsuna yelled and Kira turned to her, dropping Usagi back on 
the couch. The poor girl looked ready to cry or wet herself. &quot;I left on 
my own accord Kira-san. I did. She didn&#39;t have anything to do with it.&quot; 
Kira barked out a laugh.

&quot;Even now you choose your Princess, your Queen. Did she mean so much to 
you? Does she now? Do they? I was going to take them before, but now it 
means even more. All those stories of your friends, it&#39;s them right? 
Same names too? So, I&#39;ll be taking, who? Ami-san and Rei-san right?&quot; 
Ami and Rei jumped and Makoto growled as did Haruka. &quot;That would make 
you Makoto, and which of you is Minako-san?&quot; Minako&#39;s eyes widened and 
Kira glared at her. &quot;Stupid clueless girls. Just as slow in this life 
as you were in the last. You should be thanking me for taking them and 
away from the pain you cause. You two must be Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san. No &#39;crown prince&#39;? Not a big loss there. Earth&#39;s defender 
was such a loser anyway. We&#39;re better off. And you little one, I don&#39;t 
know. You weren&#39;t alive then. Oh well. I could find out if it were that 
important. And maybe I will. Maybe I will come back for you. But right 
now, I&#39;m taking them. Save for you little one, there&#39;s no taste sweeter 
than a heart that suffers from unrequited love, and you two have it 
bad.&quot; Ami blushed and Rei gaped. &quot;Yeah, I could feel it off you a mile a 
way. That&#39;s why I came. But now I know for sure. You all probably have 
the same tendencies as you did in the last life.&quot; She picked up Rei over 
her shoulder and held Ami under her arm. They both looked shocked. 
&quot;It&#39;s kinda funny huh Setsuna? The three of us all have something in 
common. We&#39;ve all been shot-down by you.&quot; Kira spoke with a tear in her 
eye and Setsuna whimpered again. Brave front or no, she was hurting. 
&quot;See you later little one. And you, good bye Setsuna-...san.&quot; She 
whispered. With a small puff of smoke that was more for effect than 
anything else, Kira, along with Rei and Ami, disappeared.
