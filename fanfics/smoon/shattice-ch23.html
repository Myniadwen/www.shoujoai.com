<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 23 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch22.html">Back to Part 22</a><pre>&quot;Shutter Chance!&quot; the phage cried out, her camera-arm
lighting up the night as she shot out another bolt of
energy. Their former photographer was now a distorted
sailor senshi, trying her best to kill them with
laser-like bursts from her camera-arm.

Star Fighter scowled as the black haired woman came
down from one of her leaps, her talisman in hand.
&quot;Star Serious Laser!&quot; the leather bikini clad woman
cried out, the star-designed box flaring as it sent
forth a powerful beam.

Star Healer looked at her in surprise as their foe
crumpled, her white hair falling into her eyes. &quot;Half
power?&quot; she asked, raising her eyebrows.

Keeping a wry eye on their foe Star Fighter said, &quot;I&#39;m
trying not to kill her... if Maker and I keep her
contained, can you find Sailor Mercury?&quot;

&quot;Is that wise?&quot; Star Maker asked, her long brown hair
flowing.

&quot;She&#39;s an innocent,&quot; Star Fighter said softly, &quot;we
should at least try to save her.

&quot;What a shot!&quot; the Phage exclaimed. Her weapon-arm
came up, &quot;Shutter Chance!&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Star Healer blurted as they leapt aside.
She bounded up to a roof as she called, &quot;I&#39;ll be back
as quick as I can.&quot;

&quot;Make it fast,&quot; Star Maker winced, realizing she had
been singed a bit.

Bounding from roof to roof Star Healer looked around
wildly, racing across the city as she searched. She
moved with unearthly grace and speed, white ponytail
bouncing, the star on her brow gleaming in the
starlight. The seconds ticked by to minutes as she
hurried, then finally she saw a flash of movement,
&#39;There!&#39;

Sailor Uranus saw her first, the sandy haired woman
giving her a suspicious look as Star Healer raced up
to them. She tried to shield Sailor Merccury
reflexedly, only to get gently poked I the side by the
blue haired woman. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she smiled.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot; Sailor Mercury demanded of Star
Healer, seeing how out of breath she was.

&quot;Star Fighter and Maker are fighting,&quot; Healer gasped,
&quot;a phage... they&#39;ve got it contained, but they need
help to stop it.&quot;

&quot;Lead the way,&quot; Sailor Mercury said firmly.

&quot;Are you sure about this?&quot; Sailor Neptune asked
Mercury softly as they leapt after Healer, &quot;It could
be a trap, you know.&quot;

&quot;You and Uranus are both professionally paranoid,
aren&#39;t you?&quot; Sailor Mercury smiled as she answered her
softly.

&quot;Well, yes,&quot; Uranus admitted with a grin.

They reached the battlefield in moments, Star Maker
looking up to smile slightly, &quot;Good to see you, Sailor
Mercury.&quot;

&quot;Neptune Deep Submerge!&quot; Neptune cried, throwing a
blue-white sphere of energized water to stagger the
phage a moment.

&quot;Now, Sailor Mercury!&quot; Star Fighter cried happily.

&quot;I don&#39;t need a cue,&quot; Sailor Mercury muttered as she
raised her sword. In a second Mercury&#39;s crystal locket
blazed then the weapon shifted to a scepter in her
hands, one that gleamed purest silver, the circular
head decorated with a ruby, emerald, diamond and a
crescent moon. The dark blue cloak that had been added
to her costume swirled around her slim body as she
raised it, watching as her foe staggered to her feet,
power and cold swirling around the weapon. She pointed
it and declared, &quot;Mercury Freezing Restoration!&quot;

The phage didn&#39;t even manage a final attack as ice
swept over it, her voice weak as she gasped out,
&quot;Shutter Chance...&quot; In a second the layer of ice
shattered and a young woman lay there, her clothes a
mess and her camera laying in a puddle of water.

&quot;Is everyone all right?&quot; Uranus demanded, all the
while keeping a wary eye on the three black clad
women.

Star Fighter gave her a frown, moving to support Star
Maker as the other woman staggered. &quot;We all took some
hits,&quot; she acknowledged, &quot;but we&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;Do you want us to...&quot; Neptune began.

&quot;No,&quot; Star Healer said shortly.

&quot;Healer!&quot; Star Maker scolded. She gave the others a
wry smile, &quot;Sorry.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Mercury waved it off, her costume
and weapon having reverted to normal. She hesitated a
moment then drew something from her costume, tossing
it to Star Fighter, &quot;Here.&quot;

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Uranus hissed.

Star Fighter caught it, &quot;This is...?&quot;

&quot;A communicator,&quot; Mercury answered, &quot;so far I seem to
be the only one who can revert the phages, it makes
sense for you to have a way to reach me.&quot;

Star Fighter studied it, smiling faintly before
smiling, &quot;Thank you.&quot; With that the three Starlights
were gone, disappearing into the night.

&quot;Are you actually going to use that thing?&quot; Star
Healer asked her a few moments later as they raced
across town.

Star Fighter smiled slightly, &quot;Probably... we can&#39;t
save the Phage&#39;s any other way.&quot; Silently she added,
&#39;And I&#39;d like to know this Mercury better.&#39;

Setsuna Meiou smiled to herself as she listened to
them coming up the hall to the apartment. She was
there with Hotaru and Chibi-Usa, it was her turn to
keep an eye on them tonight while the others went out
on patrol. She stood and walked to the door, black
hair shimmering with green as they came in, &quot;How did
it go?&quot;

&quot;Made an ass of myself again,&quot; Haruka Tenoh admitted,
smiling ruefully, &quot;sorry, Ami.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Haruka,&quot; Ami Mizuno gave her friend a
smile, &quot;I know I surprised you with that
communicator.&quot;

&quot;So you made up your mind to give one to the
Starlights?&quot; Luna asked from where the black cat was
perched on the table.

&quot;You knew, I guess?&quot; Michiru asked, her light green
hair flowing around her face.

&quot;We discussed it,&quot; Artemis shrugged from where the
white cat sat nearby, &quot;but I thought Ami was still
thinking about it.&quot;

&quot;I was,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;right up to five seconds
before I gave it to them.&quot;

&quot;Sit down, you all look beat,&quot; Setsuna said gently,
gesturing them to seats. She look at Ami, &quot;I can guess
your reasoning, I think...&quot;

Ami sighed, &quot;It&#39;s really simple. I&#39;m the only one who
can free the transformed people, and the Starlights
were ready to kill a transformed woman the first time
we met.&quot; A shrug, &quot;I don&#39;t want that happening, ever.&quot;

&quot;I guess what worries me is their being able to listen
in on our conversations,&quot; Luna fretted.

Ami gave her a faintly disappointed look. &quot;It&#39;s a one
way device,&quot; she explained, &quot;they can call us, that&#39;s
all.&quot;

&quot;Oops,&quot; Artemis gave Luna a wry look.

&quot;I should have known you&#39;d think of that,&quot; Haruka
grinned.

Setsuna smiled as she put her hand on Ami&#39;s, noticing
how tired the younger woman really is. &quot;Are you going
to be all right?&quot;

&quot;The healing takes a lot out of me,&quot; Ami confessed,
getting up from the table. She swayed a moment, then
with an expression of surprise on her face toppled
over in a dead faint.

&quot;AMI!&quot;</pre>
