<h1>Fire's Love in the Light of the Moon</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kenneday.html">John deGraffenreid</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ohayo minna! I&#39;m back. This is a Serena/Rei story so it is an
alternate reality so no flames please. I was inspired by a number of
stories most notably those by Chris Davies. I recommend them to all
Sailor Moon fans. I don&#39;t own Sailor Moon or any of the characters so
please don&#39;t sue me. I don&#39;t have anything anyway. Just so you know
the story takes place in the same time-line as my Lita/Amy story. I
also use most of the North American names except for Haruka and
Michiru, mainly because I like how those names sound.  Hope you enjoy
it, please email me and let me know. On with the story.  One last
thing, the Sailor Senshi do exist in this timeline, its also in the
same time line as my previous to Lita/Amy stories but each can stand
on its own.  I also don&#39;t own the song She&#39;s Every Woman by Garth
Brooks. Its owned by him and some big companies so please don&#39;t sue
me.  I dedicate this story to my friend Heather. Thanks for the
encouragement.

---------------------------------------

It was a rainy November morning. The dreary weather reflected the moods
of the people gathered at the funeral of Darien Chiba. The news had
reported his death as having been the result of a motorcycle crash but
among those gathered at the ceremony there were people who knew the
truth. He had died in a youma attack, protecting his love Serena. Of
course no one outside the close knit group of friends could know the
truth, that would bring up other questions that they couldn&#39;t answer.
Serena had been devastated by Darien&#39;s death and was crying
hysterically during the funeral. The others holding her and comforting
her as best they could. She was dealing with a tremendous loss. Her
soul mate was gone and there was a good possibility that she might never
see him again. The other sailors were trying to comfort her but it was
having little effect. As the friends watched the rose laden casket
lowered into the grave Rei looked over at Serena and sighed. Darien&#39;s
loss might be one from which she would never recover. After all the
times that Serena had been there for her she could now be there for her
friend. The one person who had helped her feel wanted and not so alone
anymore. The one she had come to love in the most profound way
imaginable, though she had yet to realize this aspect of her feelings.

After the funeral little was said as the Senshi gathered for a private
reception. The air had a depressive, heavy feel to it as they gathered
at the Cherry Hill shrine. Rei had been uncomfortable at the funeral as
it made her even more aware of being caught between two religions.
&#39;That&#39;s a topic for another time though&#39; she thought. &#39;Right now Serena
needs me.&#39; All the Senshi were there, including Hotaru who had
inexplicably begun to age at a rapid pace in the months before Darien&#39;s
death. Now Rini&#39;s age she and Small Lady held each other as they cried
next to Haruka and Michiru. They all felt the loss, like a part of them
had died with him. Rei walked to Serena and sat next to her as she
looked out over the other sailors. Amy and Lita, who had been going
steady for about three months now, were holding each other tightly.
Mina was sitting with Trista, consoling the older woman. &#39;She must have
known what was going to happen&#39; Rei thought to herself. &#39;She knew and
couldn&#39;t stop it from happening.&#39; Tears started to well up in Rei&#39;s
eyes as two slender arms enveloped her in a crushing bear hug.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry Rei,&quot; Serena said, &quot;it&#39;ll be ok.&quot; Rei was dumbfounded. Here
Serena had just lost her soul mate and yet she still found a place in
her heart for others. A feeling of warmth and safety flowed through Rei
as she broke down and cried. She had tried not to for Serena&#39;s sake but
the girl&#39;s unselfish actions pushed the emotions to the surface. Rei
hugged Serena back as she too began to cry a new. All the Senshi
gathered around them at this point in one massive embrace, each lending
their strength to the others.

Unbeknownst to all two spirits watched the happenings from a hidden
place in the Palace of Time. One was dressed in a long, flowing dress,
her silver hair done into two odangos with the tails flowing to her
feet. A pair of faerie like wings grew from her back. The other was a
male dressed in regal looking armor, his ebon hair and storm blue eyes
looking on lovingly at his love.

&quot;Are you sure about this Endymion?&quot; The woman asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sure Queen Serenity. She is destined for another in this time. If
I would have stayed they would never realize this destiny. I only want
her happiness, even if I must make her sad for a time before hand.
Besides it was my time, the empire my family had a thousand years ago
is no more. The way must b paved for a new way. Her way, I do not
regret doing this.&quot; Serenity smiled at this and turned back to watch
her daughter. She had fallen asleep in Rei&#39;s arms, the raven haired
girl slowly and silently motioning the others to leave. Rini went with
Haruka, Michiru, Trista and Hotaru since they had the most room, and
since she and Hotaru were such good friends (AN: they&#39;re only about ten
here). Amy and Lita left together with Mina; most likely going to Amy&#39;s
house to talk with her mother about the recent tragedy. The Queen
looked on sadly knowing the pain her daughter was in but also knowing
that this really was for the best. She had been forced to choose
between two loves once, she should not have to do so again. Looking
back to Endymion she nodded her approval.

&quot;Give them time to mourn Endymion then you may proceed. You are far
stronger than I ever gave you credit for.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Queen Serenity, I&#39;ll be watching over her until they find
one another again.&quot; With that Endymion&#39;s spirit disappeared leaving the
spirit of Queen Serenity to watch the Senshi of Mars quietly and gently
lay Serena down on a futon and cover her with a blanket. Rolling out
another futon Rei placed it close to Serena and slept beside her so she
wouldn&#39;t be alone. Late into the night Serena awoke to see Rei sleeping
close to her. Tears started to form again as suddenly thoughts of
Darien invaded her thoughts. She began to sob softly as she cried
herself back to sleep. Unknown to her however, was the fact that Rei
had heard her sobbing and was in fact fighting back tears of her own.
She couldn&#39;t stand to see Serena like this, but she knew it would take
time. She only wanted her angel back to her normal happy self. Never
thinking of where the word angel had come from Rei slowly allowed sleep
overtake her exhausted body.

As she slept she dreamt of the Silver Millennium. In her minds eye she
saw herself and Princess Serenity in tears, Endymion near crying
himself. She couldn&#39;t hear what was being said but she knew it was bad.
She saw her former self run from the scene crying hysterically.
Endymion and Serenity then embraced as he tried to comfort the sobbing
Princess. It was at this point she awoke. Rubbing her eyes she went
into the kitchen to fix something for herself and her impromptu guest.
She wasn&#39;t much of a cook but she knew a few things. She knew she would
have to go to school today though she wished that she didn&#39;t have to.
Soon the smell of rice and bacon filled the kitchen and worked its way
to a still sleeping Serena. She woke and walked into the kitchen, her
eyes still red from crying late into the night. Rei looked over to
Serena as she finished the food and motioned for her to sit and eat.

&quot;Morning Serena,&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ve got breakfast ready if you&#39;re
hungry.&quot;

&quot;I guess I&#39;ll eat something, thanks Rei.&quot; Serena said sadly as she sat.
She noticed Rei fidgeting with her food and spoke up.

&quot;Uhm Rei, are you ok? If I kept you up I&#39;m sorry. I really didn&#39;t mean
to.&quot; Rei looked back still amazed at Serena&#39;s completely selfless
nature. She smiled for the first time since before Darien&#39;s death.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll be ok Serena. Its just that I have school today and I
don&#39;t think I can handle it.&quot;

&quot;So why go?&quot;

&quot;Because Serena, Grandpa pulled allot of strings to get me into private
school. I couldn&#39;t ditch and disappoint him like that. I just don&#39;t
want to deal with the stares and comments today. I can&#39;t handle it
today.&quot; Rei was on the verge of tears when Serena spoke quietly.

&quot;What if I went with you? Would that help? Just say I&#39;m visiting.&quot; Rei
sighed knowing that if Serena wanted to help there was little she could
do to stop her. Even if she was still in mourning.

&quot;That would help me a lot Serena, but what about your school?&quot;

&quot;Miss H gave me the week off for the funeral and mourning.&quot; Serena&#39;s
eyes began to well up with tears again. She threw herself into Rei&#39;s
arms as she began to sob uncontrollably again. &quot;Oh Rei! Why did he die?
We were supposed to be together forever this time.&quot; Gently rocking her
friend back and forth Rei tried to console her friend.

&quot;I don&#39;t know Serena. I&#39;m sure he&#39;s been reborn already. If not he will
be soon.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think so Rei. This is different. I&#39;d still feel our
connection, but its just gone. He&#39;s not coming back this time I just
know it.&quot; After several minutes of crying Serena and Rei went into the
Miko&#39;s room to get ready for the day.

&quot;Serena,&quot; Rei said, &quot;Why don&#39;t you have a shower and get cleaned up.
I&#39;ll loan you some clothes for the day.&quot;

&quot;Thanks Rei. I know I get on your nerves, and I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m being a
burden.&quot; Rei was shocked at this comment. From somewhere deep in her
mind, however she heard a voice. &#39;Are you really that surprised? When
have you done anything but insult her the way Darien used to?&#39; Shaking
her head she handed Serena a pair of pink overalls, socks,
undergarments and a white turtleneck.

&quot;Serena you&#39;re never a burden. You&#39;re one of my best friends. Please
don&#39;t think otherwise.&quot; Nodding sadly Serena undid her odangos and let
her golden hair cascade around her as she walked slowly into the
bathroom. Rei, was amazed at just how lovely Serena was. She&#39;d never
really noticed it before, and wasn&#39;t really sure why she did now. All
she knew was that her friend was in terrible pain and she was going to
help her. At least she would try. She knew Serena was going to go with
her to the private school she attended and only hoped that the other
students wouldn&#39;t say anything to her.

&#39;Truth is you worried about her because you care more than you let on&#39;
said the voice again. Shaking her head she gathered her school uniform
and called Serena&#39;s parents to let them know that she would be spending
the day with her, to help her through her mourning. &quot;Thank you for
calling Rei,&quot; Ilene said. &quot;Serena must have loved him very much.&quot;

&quot;Its ok Mrs. Tsukino. Serena loved him more than you know. I&#39;ll keep an
eye on her and make sure she&#39;s ok. I&#39;ll have her home tonight. Bye
now.&quot;

&quot;Bye Rei. Thank you again for letting us know.&quot; As Rei hung the phone
up, she heard the water in the bathroom cut off. Serena stepped out of
the bathroom shortly there after dressed in the clothes Rei had loaned
her. Her hair was still down, so Rei handed her a brush.

&quot;Would you like some help with your hair Serena? I have some time
before I have to leave.&quot;

&quot;No thanks Rei, I can manage. Could I borrow a brush and some barrettes
please?&quot;

&quot;Of course Serena.&quot; Rei handed her friend a brush and the items she
needed to put her hair into her traditional &quot;meatballs&quot;. &#39;I can&#39;t call
her that now.&#39; Rei thought as she entered her bathroom to clean up
before she had to leave. &#39;All it would do is remind her of Darien.&#39;
&#39;Are you sure that&#39;s all there is to it?&#39; came that annoying voice
again. Rei tried to clear her head but secretly she knew what the voice
was saying. Though her conscious mind still ignored it. After she was
done she dressed in her school uniform and walked out. Serena was
waiting for her by the door and the two of them walked quietly to Rei&#39;s
school. As they got closer Serena looked up to see the large cross
rising up from the central building.

&quot;Uhm..Rei, is this the right school?&quot; she asked innocently. Rei cringed
but knew her friend deserved to know if she would be there for most of
the day.

&quot;Yeah this is the right place Serena. This is a Catholic school. I&#39;m
not exactly thrilled about going here but I don&#39;t have much choice. I
just hope the others lay off for once.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean Rei?&quot; As if to answer her question a trio of older
girls leaning against the wall started taunting Rei.

&quot;Hey look its the heathen. Hi heathen send any souls to hell lately?&quot;
Rei cringed again but tried to ignore the taunts. She had heard them
all before, but it never hurt quite as bad as it did now. What would
Serena say? She then noticed that Serena wasn&#39;t with her but had walked
up to the largest of the trio a hand raised. &#39;She wouldn&#39;t&#39; Rei
thought. &#39;Serena wouldn&#39;t do what I think she&#39;s go&#39; SLAP!! Serena&#39;s
hand left a definite imprint on the larger girls face. She was
noticeably surprised.

&quot;How dare you talk to Rei like that!&#39; Serena yelled. &quot;You have no right
to treat her in such a shameful manner. Who do you think you are
anyway?!&quot; Few things got Serena mad, but even Rei had never seen her
this hot. &#39;See&#39; the voice said. &#39;She really cares about you.&#39; Rei
smiled to herself as she walked over to Serena, who still verbally
berating the trio. Tapping Serena on the shoulder distracted her long
enough for the trio to leave rather quickly.

&quot;Thank you Serena.&quot; Rei said as she hugged her friend. A feeling of
familiarity washed over her as she held her friend close.

&quot;Sure Rei! I mean I&#39;m still sad but no one messes with my friends like
that!&quot; She said proudly. Rei chuckled lightly.

&quot;Well we need to get o my class. Come one Serena we need to stop by the
office to get you a pass.&quot; After this the day went on rather slowly.
For the first time in a long time Rei didn&#39;t feel quite so alone at
school. It was like Serena&#39;s very presence made the darkness retreat in
terror. More than once she caught herself staring at Serena marveling
at her innocence and sheer capacity for love. Here she was in mourning
for her soul mate and yet she still had the room in her heart to come
with her to her private school and make sure that she was ok. &#39;You&#39;re
almost there Rei. Just dig a little deeper. You&#39;ve been fooling
yourself for far too long.&#39; The voice in the back of her head said
again. She couldn&#39;t help but think it sounded familiar, she just
couldn&#39;t place it yet. As the day ended Rei walked Serena back to her
own place.

&quot;Are you gonna be ok Serena?&quot;

&quot;Someday Rei, I hope. This is gonna take me a long time to get over.
Darien was my soul mate and he died. I&#39;m alone now.&quot; Tears were forming
again as Rei went to embrace her friend in a comforting hug.

&quot;Serena. Never say that. You are not alone, you have all the other
Senshi to look out for you and be your friends. I have to head back to
the shrine now. If you need me just call ok?&quot;

&quot;Ok Rei. Thank you for being there for me.&quot;

---------------------------------------------

As this was going on Mina was studying for an upcoming test when a
strange feeling came over her. It was almost like the beginnings of a
bond forming. Shuddering she wished she knew what was going on. There
were times she hated being an empath. The ability to sense emotions was
useful since she was the Senshi of love and beauty, but there were
times when it was a curse. Like when Darien had died, she had felt his
bond with Serena shatter. It wasn&#39;t a pleasant feeling. It must have
been exceedingly worse for Serena. This new bond she felt, though, was
different. It was almost like it wasn&#39;t a new bond but a very old one.
Almost as old as Serena&#39;s and Darien&#39;s. No it was different. She
couldn&#39;t quite put her finger on it, but there was definitely something
different about it. Rubbing her eyes she decided to go out for a walk
to stretch and clear her thoughts. Hopefully not think about this new
feeling for a while. &#39;After all,&#39; she thought, &#39;Curiosity shaved the
cat.&#39;

As she walked through they city Mina couldn&#39;t help but think of the
bond she felt forming, or rather re-forming. Who could it be? Normally
her empathic abilities would have let her figure this kind of thing out
relatively quickly but it was almost like something was blocking her
this time. Whatever was going on she knew it was important, she didn&#39;t
know why she thought so but she knew she shouldn&#39;t interfere. She knew
from her days as Sailor V to trust her instincts. She would just have
to trust them this time and hope for the best. Sighing loudly she
decided to go to Amy&#39;s and see if she could get some help studying. She
also knew she&#39;d be able to grill Amy and Lita on their latest date.
Grinning happily she headed off to see her friends.

--------------------------------------

Several weeks later, Rei sat at the desk in her room, her open diary
before her, an pen between her teeth. During this time Serena had been
like a ghost, Rei had been the only one she would talk to about her
feelings toward Darien. The other Senshi had been growing worried until
Rei told them that she was looking out for Serena and would make sure
to call them if anything needed to be done. Serena had visited Rei one
afternoon when she&#39;d had half a day at Crosswinds. Rei was, of course
surprised. Ever since that day when Serena had come with her to her
school the trio hadn&#39;t bugged her quite as much, but that was because
they had started spreading rumors about her. Things were worse and she
didn&#39;t want Serena exposed to that kind of malicious rumor mongering.
Still her heart had soared when she saw Serena waiting for her hear the
front gates of her school. The two had gone shopping that evening and
for the first time since Darien&#39;s death she looked like she was coming
alive again. Of course this still didn&#39;t explain why her heart sped up
so much whenever her odangoed friend came near her. Thus why she had
her diary out. She knew she wanted to write something but she didn&#39;t
know quite what. Over the course of the last few weeks she had been
confused by her feelings toward Serena. Where were they coming from?
&#39;Why not ask if they were already there?&#39; I must be losing my mind she
thought. Why else would I keep hearing this voice in my head? &#39;Maybe
because you won&#39;t listen to your heart until your subconscious makes
you.&#39; Growling in frustration Rei turned on her radio only to find it
stuck on the local country station. Finding the knob stuck she tried
turning it off to no avail. What she heard next shocked her into
silence. It was a song by an artist named Garth Brooks; a song that
forced her to listen to her heart on how she felt about Serena.

She&#39;s sun and rain, she&#39;d fire and ice
A little crazy but it&#39;s nice
And when she gets mad, you best leave her alone
&#39;Cause she&#39;ll rage just like a river
Then she&#39;ll beg you to forgive her
She&#39;s every woman that I&#39;ve ever known.

She&#39;s so New York and then LA
And every town along the way
She&#39;s every place that I&#39;ve never been
She&#39;s making love on rainy nights
She&#39;s a stroll through Christmas lights
And she&#39;s everything I want to do again

It needs no explanation
&#39;Cause it all makes perfect sense
For when it comes down to temptation
She&#39;s on both sides of the fence

No it needs no explanation
&#39;Cause it all makes perfect sense
When it comes down to temptation
She&#39;s on both sides of the fence

She&#39;s anything but typical
She&#39;s so unpredictable
Oh but even at her worst she ain&#39;t that bad
She&#39;s as real as real can be
And she&#39;s every fantasy
Lord she&#39;s every lover that I&#39;ve ever had
And she&#39;s every lover that I&#39;ve never had

As the song faded out Rei found that she was able to turn off the
radio. After she did so she returned to her desk and thought for a
moment. She thought back on everything that she and the others had been
through. All the pain, the enemies, the heartaches, the endless
battles, the loneliness. The terrible, terrible loneliness; that had
all but disappeared when she met Serena. Looking back she thought about
how they had met and how much brighter things had seemed when she was
around. The temple was lonelier now that Chad had left. He had told her
that he knew she was in love with someone else and that it was ok with
him, so long as she stopped denying it and just let herself feel it.
&#39;Just a little bit more Rei you&#39;re almost there.&#39; Ugh, that voice
again. She thought, who are you? &#39;You&#39;ll find out soon enough Rei now
you&#39;ve got some more thinking to do so I&#39;ll leave you to your thoughts.
Just remember love is love, no matter who you fall for.&#39; With that the
voice stopped and the air was still again. Alone with her thoughts she
thought back on her memories of Serena, her golden angel that had
accepted her without question and saved her from a life of loneliness.
She knew then that she was in love with Serena. How had it happened?
She began to write in her diary

&quot;Dear Diary,&quot; she said as she wrote. &quot;Today I think I finally realized
what I&#39;ve been denying for so long. I&#39;ve been denying it because I
think I didn&#39;t want to admit to myself that I was that way. So I was
mean to her, I said some pretty bad things in the years we&#39;ve known
each other. Lately, though, with Darien&#39;s death she&#39;s come to depend on
me more than the other Senshi. Why I don&#39;t know. I just know that
there&#39;s something between us, and I love her. That&#39;s right, I love her.
I can even remember now when I first fell for her. It was during our
war with Beryl and her Nega-sleaze generals. Our final meeting with
Nephlyte actually. We came upon the scene where Zoicite had Molly and
Nephlyte trapped. He had been hurt badly trying to save Molly. We were
too late to save him. if we&#39;d had the Silver Crystal at the time I&#39;m
sure that she would have tried to save his life. I&#39;m not sure I would
have done the same.

&quot;Any way we got there just as Zoicite was leaving. Nephlyte actually
asked our forgiveness and apologized to Molly for lying to her again.
He slowly faded away, Molly screaming into the night with a heartbreak
that I&#39;d not ever seen. I turned to look at Serena and she was in
tears. Crying not just for Molly but for Nephlyte. She was crying for
one of the enemy. Crying because in the short time he had known Molly
she had shown him what it meant to love. He learned and then he died. I
think that was when I fell for her. Her compassion and love for all
things is near legendary within the Senshi. I could tell you a million
similar stories and even now I find my self getting misty over the
memories. I only fear that Serena will never love me as I do her. You
see, when Darien died Serena broke. She&#39;s been like a ghost lately. I
hope she can overcome her grief and see that there are others who love
her. People like me who need her laughter and light to bring us out of
the darkness of our everyday lives. Its too soon to tell her how I
feel, she&#39;s still in mourning. When the time is right I&#39;ll tell her,
but right now she needs me as her anchor. I will be there, just as she
has always been there for me.&quot; Closing the diary Rei went to her Shrine
duties, thinking about the voice and how it had made her come to terms
with how she felt about Serena. She didn&#39;t know what was going on but
she knew that at that moment, though she didn&#39;t know if Serena would
ever feel the same way, she was happy again.

That night at the Tsukino home, Serena trudged slowly up to her room.
Her parents were growing concerned. She had eaten, but not like she
usually did. After eating she had decided to go to bed, since it was
only eight o&#39;clock her parents grew more concerned. Luna was especially
worried. Serena was still in mourning, as she should have been, but
there was something else troubling her. Something she wasn&#39;t talking
about, and knowing Serena as she did she knew that her charge wouldn&#39;t
talk about it until she was good and ready to. Though some how her
recent attitude and the way she would act around Rei seemed very
familiar. Like something from the past, but for the life of her she
couldn&#39;t remember. Not all of their memories had returned and this
annoyed her, she didn&#39;t like not knowing something. Of course she could
always ask Pluto. She always had this way of knowing what was going on
though she didn&#39;t often share that knowledge. She took her duties as
the Guardian of Time seriously and would do nothing to threaten the
time stream. Sighing she curled up next to Serena and slept beside her
charge, determined to stay close to her just in case she was needed.

In her dreams Serena saw a thin, red string tied to her left wrist. It
traveled off and ended where another wrist should have been. Yet
another reminder that Darien was gone. Then she saw a pair of ghostly
hands gently pick up the empty end of the string and tie it to another
wrist. She couldn&#39;t make out who was on the other end, but she felt an
old connection. One as old as the one she felt with Darien. A voice
came to her as she finally slipped into a peaceful slumber, the first
she&#39;d had since Darien&#39;s death so nearly a month ago.

&quot;You are not alone Princess.&quot; the voice said, a ring of familiarity to
it. &quot;There is another that loves you as he did. &quot;

&quot;Where is this new love?&quot; she asked

&quot;I never said it was a new love, in fact its an old love, one that&#39;s as
old as your previous one. That love is closer than you know. When the
time is right it will be revealed. When it is I shall reveal myself to
you. Now sleep Princess, sleep and know that you are loved.&quot;

----Serena&#39;s dream (the Silver Millennium)----

Serena saw herself as Princess Serenity in the palace of the Moon
Kingdom. At her side was Mars, the two of them appeared to be having an
intense discussion. Standing not too far way was Darien when he was
Endymion. Mars and Serenity were crying by now and Endymion was on the
verge of tears as well. She didn&#39;t know what was going on but it seemed
so familiar. Like it was a memory only now coming back to her. She felt
the heartbreak of the two women, like something sacred between them had
been broken. Mars was leaning forward, tears flowing down her face, she
was about to say something when Serena was woken up by the smell of
food being cooked. The heaven sent aroma of freshly cooked bacon and
French toast wafted to her room. She shot out of bed and down the
stairs, feeling strangely at ease. Like the loss she had endured didn&#39;t
hurt quite as bad. It still hurt, and most likely would for a long
time, but for some reason she felt more like her old self today.

After eating a large breakfast with her family in near shock Serena
headed for the day&#39;s Senshi meeting. As it was Saturday and school was
out, it had been discussed that they would have meetings each Saturday
morning Since all the Senshi could be there. She skipped along the
street, Rini at her side giving her future mother odd looks. &#39;I thought
she was in mourning. Maybe she&#39;s finally feeling better.&#39; Rini thought.
&#39;I hope so.. I missed this Serena.&#39; Smiling the small girl reached up
and took Serena&#39;s hand. Serena stopped for a moment and looked down at
the pink-haired child and smiled. The others needed her, and she needed
them. &#39;Especially Rei,&#39; She thought. &#39;I never knew Rei had it so rough
at her school. Maybe we can do something together tonight, maybe I can
even get the other Senshi to come too. A girls night out. What a great
idea!&#39; Serena looked down at Rini again and kneeled down to talk to the
girl.

&quot;Hey Rini, since we&#39;re almost to the Shrine wanna ride piggy back?&quot;
Looking surprised Rini smiled from ear to ear.

&quot;Yeah Serena! Would you please?&quot; Nodding to the girl Serena turned
around and let Rini climb on her back. Taking a deep breath Serena
stood and began to run to the shrine, Rini giggling with delight the
whole way there. The others heard them coming as they ran up the stairs
and stared at each other shocked.

&quot;She&#39;s actually early!&quot; Amy exclaimed as Lita held her close.

&quot;I know, hey maybe she&#39;s feeling better.&quot; Lita said. Haruka and Michiru
just looked on, waiting to see what was going on. Hotaru ran to the
door to greet her best friend. Trista sat back looking for all the
world like none of this surprised her. Mina sat on Trista&#39;s right,
trying to figure out why she was sensing a more intense bonding than
she had previously. Rei smiled as she saw Serena walk in carrying Rini
on her back. The two were surely mother and daughter. &#39;Wait an minute.&#39;
She thought. &#39;If Rini was Darien&#39;s daughter how is she still here? Oh
well I guess I can ask the great fire later.&#39; The meeting went as all
expected, with no new enemies the discussion quickly became catching up
with each other and just spending time together as friends. Amy and
Lita had become closer during the months they had been seeing each
other and were good friends with Haruka and Michiru. As the day moved
on Rini was invited to stay with the Outer Senshi and Hotaru that
night, and of course she accepted. Amy and Lita mentioned their plans
to go rent the Matrix and Heart and Souls that night. Mina had planned
on getting some much needed studying done, which shocked many, since
she had an upcoming English test. This left Serena&#39;s plan with some
serious holes, but she was determined to pull it off.

&quot;Uhm...hey guys,&quot; she said, &quot;I have an idea for anyone who wants to
join in.&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s up Serena,&quot; Rei said as she sat next to her secret love.

&quot;Well I was thinking that maybe we could go do some karaoke. If anyone
wants to go that is.&quot; Haruka and Michiru gladly volunteered as they
wanted to get closer to Serena since the aftermath of the Deathbuster
scenario. The others declined for the reasons mentioned earlier. Serena
was disappointed to a point but knew that she probably should have
thought about this earlier and made the plans in advance with everyone
instead of being so impulsive. Rei noticed the look on Serena&#39;s face
and quickly spoke up.

&quot;I&#39;ll go Serena, you know much I like to sing.&quot;

&quot;Really Rei?&quot; Serena said, the excitement in her voice obvious to all.
She embraced Rei in a crushing bear hug. &quot;Oh thank you Rei, thank you
Haruka, you too Michiru. I just know this&#39;ll be a blast.&quot; The three
women smiled. Haruka and Michiru because they were beginning to
understand what made Serena so strong, and what would make her the true
sovereign that she would grow to become. Rei because she was doing
something to make her love happy. Though Serena didn&#39;t know it yet. The
meeting broke up at this point and the Senshi went their separate ways.

Haruka drove the four of them to the Karaoke Palace, a relatively new
place that was geared toward more of a younger crowd. It had no
alcohol, which they all knew was a good thing considering Serena&#39;s
extremely low tolerance for the stuff. They got their booth and they
women took their turns, making each other laugh with the odd songs they
chose to sing. As the night wore on Haruka and Michiru sang together, a
song from a popular anime about a young man constantly hounded by
attractive alien women. After they finished it was Rei&#39;s turn. They had
noticed how Rei would look at Serena in a way they hadn&#39;t seen before.
Unlike many of the Senshi they remembered the Silver Millennium quite
well and they knew how much the Princess and Mars had loved each other
at the time. Rei stood and walked toward the machine and looked through
the song list before she chose the one she would sing. &#39;It&#39;s time.&#39; she
thought to herself. &#39;I have to let her know now before I lose my
nerve.&#39;

&quot;Come on Rei!&quot; Serena yelled.&quot;You can do it, I believe in you.&quot; Rei
blushed at this and Haruka and Michiru exchanged another look. Perhaps
old feelings were starting to resurface they thought. Their
introspection was cut short when Rei began to sing a ballad, staring
into Serena&#39;s eyes as she sang.

I can&#39;t shower you with pearls
And diamond rings
All I can give are dances in the rain
I can&#39;t cover you in satin sheets
But you&#39;ll be just as warm
Wrapped up each night
In my loving arms

Serena began to blush at this, suddenly feeling a very old connection
to the Senshi of Fire and Soul.

I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars
Will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own

Rei moved closer to Serena as she continued to sing, Haruka and Michiru
becoming misty eyed as they felt the renewed love passing between the
two girls.

I can&#39;t promise you the life that money buys
But I can promise you a richer life
There&#39;s places you may never see
But one thing you can know
I&#39;ll be there with you
Wherever we don&#39;t go

I can never lay the world down at your feet
The moon and stars
Will always be beyond my reach
All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own

Serena was openly crying now as Rei finished the song.

All I have is one true heart that beats
For you and you alone
You can have everything I own
Oh you can have everything I own.

As Rei came down off the stage Serena ran up an embraced her, tears
streaming down her face. Seeing this Haruka and Michiru excused
themselves to give the two girls a few minutes to talk things out. As
they left Serena was the first to talk.

&quot;Why didn&#39;t you tell me Rei?&quot;

&quot;You were in mourning Sere.&quot; Rei said, gently stroking Serena&#39;s gold
hair. &quot;I didn&#39;t even realize how I felt until recently. It feels right
though, but if you can&#39;t handle it yet I&#39;ll understand and I&#39;ll wait
for you.&quot; Serena pulled back enough to look Rei in the eyes.

&quot;I don&#39;t remember saying I couldn&#39;t handle it Rei.&quot; she said softly.
&quot;You&#39;re right though. It does feel right, and very old too. Like the
bond I had with Darien.&quot; Serena started to cry again as Rei embraced
her tightly slowly rocking her love back and forth. Serena moved
slightly and brought her lips to Rei&#39;s. As they shared a sweet, but
passionate kiss they were surrounded by light and when they broke the
kiss they found themselves at the Gates of Time. Serena had transformed
into Serenity and Rei into Sailor Mars.

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; they said together, causing them to laugh slightly,
through their concern.

&quot;I brought you here to tell you what you&#39;re now ready to know.&quot; The two
women turned to see Endymion&#39;s spirit and that of Queen Serenity.

&quot;Endymion!&quot; Serena said excitedly &quot;I..I thought you were dead.&quot;

&quot;I am Serena,&quot; he said, stopping her from getting up. &quot;I wanted to tell
the two of you that my time was up when I died. I knew for months in
advance that my time was coming so I made preparations to ensure your
happiness Serena. I got my full memories back and remembered how you
had been forced to choose between myself and Mars so many years ago.
Don&#39;t worry about Rini, I&#39;ve seen that she&#39;ll still be born in the
future. How I can&#39;t say, only that when the time comes you&#39;ll find
out.&quot; He kissed each the two women on their foreheads. &quot;The bond the
two of you share is strong, as strong as the one I once shared with you
Serena. I only want the two of you to be happy. I caused you pain so
often you deserve some happiness. Pursue your love to the fullest. I
must go now Serena, I will be watching over both of you.&quot; With that
Endymion faded with the Gates of Time, leaving to Senshi, back in their
normal forms, holding each other lovingly each vowing to the other that
no force would ever separate them again.

constant encouragement is appreciated.
