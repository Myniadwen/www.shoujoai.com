<h1>No Time for Love (part 2 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: Yes yes, the dorky bad guy is named and modeled after 
some one from Revolutionary Girl Utena. But when reading this you have 
to admit that he fits the part quite well.


Kira grinned as the smoke around her disappeared. It was a neat little 
trick, one that she&#39;d learned at least 400 years ago, and it came in 
handy for dramatic effect. As the air cleared, the smoky view around 
her and the girls gave way to a medium sized living room of sorts. 
Decorated with reds, maroons, and black of course, it was plush and 
comfortable. A perfect littl e place to relax. She set Ami down and 
swung Rei from her shoulder to put her beside the other startled girl. 
She couldn&#39;t help the small smile at their looks of shock and anger, 
mixed in a very interesting way. Being a demon , she couldn&#39;t help but 
delight in the little bit of fear that they gave off, and her vampiric 
side&#39;s penchant for blood detection was going crazy over the innocence 
and power they exuded. But, she had wanted some permanent friends, even 
before she&#39;d known they were both senshi and Setsuna&#39;s friends, and 
biting them right off the bat wouldn&#39;t help relations. As Rei and Ami 
looked around in wide-eyed wonder at the lavish room before them, Kira 
took the opportunity to close her eyes and do her best to push the 
image of Setsuna from her mind. Nearly a thousand years later and the 
sight of her still made her heart flutter. And to find out who she 
was... Well, she could deal with all of that later. Right now, she had 
guests to entertain.

&quot;You like? I hope so. It used to be a bit dreary but I spruced it up 
when I decided to go get company. Please, make yourselves at home.&quot; Rei 
and Ami turned to her and Kira was rewarded with Rei&#39;s evil face as she 
had come to call it in the month or so of watching her. It was rare to 
piss her off to that extent, but she did look incredibly beautiful. And 
Ami, as mad as she had to be in the situation, just stared with an 
annoyed blush. 

&quot;What do you mean make ourselves at home? This isn&#39;t home! Take us back 
there right now or else I&#39;ll...&quot; Kira sighed interrupting her.

&quot;Or else you&#39;ll what my little Senshi of fire? Without your wand you 
can&#39;t transform and you don&#39;t really think you have a chance at beating a 
thousand year old vampire as a human do you?&quot; Rei fumed but obviously 
couldn&#39;t think of a smart comeback. It was not in her nature to be out 
argued, even by Ami, and being outdone by someone who just kidnapped her 
definitely didn&#39;t help her mood. Ami just stood there her head cocked 
to the side. &quot;Yes?&quot; Kira asked her, sensing the question before Ami had 
a chance to voice it. Caught off guard she blushed a bit then cleared 
her throat.

&quot;Why us?&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Why us? If you&#39;ve been around for a thousand years you must have met 
th ousands of people full of unrequited love. Why did you pick us?&quot; Kira 
grinned again. Trust Ami to ask a hard and completely unexpected 
question. Ami stared as Kira grinned. She really did want to know. If 
she was talking about what they each felt for Usagi that was one thing, 
but then she did call both Makoto and Minako idiots. * Funny. I knew 
Rei-chan was in love with Usagi-chan, but with Minako-chan? *

&quot;Honestly, I&#39;ve been looking for someone or a few someones to share life 
with for a while now. But I haven&#39;t found anyone really special. Most of 
the ones I talked to were eager to go off with a vampire and forget 
their worries but, I don&#39;t know, they just didn&#39;t hold my interest. The 
one or two that I took back with me ended up going with Akio-san 
willingly so I just kept looking.

&quot;Akio-san?&quot; Ami asked quietly, interested in the story. Rei still stood 
with her arms crossed, glaring. Kira sighed and sat down.

&quot;He&#39;s another vampire. I met him not too long after I first became one. 
He&#39;s as old as me as far as vampire years go. He&#39;s not really a friend, 
but we&#39;re not enemies. The two of us are the strongest, oldest vampires 
that we know about. He hangs around to make sure I won&#39;t threaten him. 
I&#39;m the only one strong enough to take him down. And likewise, he&#39;s the 
only one I know who poses a serious threat to me. He still has hopes 
that I&#39;ll bond with him so we can rule the underworld or living world 
because we&#39;re so powerful. I don&#39;t really have any interest in him so 
he settles for annoying me and trying to bring out my inner demon. You 
know, my full evil power.&quot; Seeing Ami&#39;s confused look she grinned.

&quot;I haven&#39;t given in which is why I don&#39;t kill when I feed or force 
anyone. I&#39;ve seen what it can do to you to embrace your evil side and 
I&#39;m not all that keen to do so. Anyway, so here I am searching for a 
playmate or two to pass the boring nights with when I stumble on your 
little group of friends. You two give off this aura of loneliness that&#39;s 
just staggering. So, I look a little closer and find not only are you two 
lonely, you&#39;re in love and it&#39;s unrequited. Being in a state of 
unrequited love myself, I decided to give you two a break and offer up 
living in peace for a while. Now, knowing who you truly are, I feel 
even better about my choice. You can live a long time so turning you 
won&#39;t be an issue for a while, if at all, and, I&#39;ve saved you both from 
a lot of unhappiness.&quot;

&quot;How exactly is kidnapping us against our will saving us from 
unhappiness?&quot; Rei interjected and Kira leaned back into the couch.

&quot;You think that living for the past few years with unrequited love for 
several different people is pain? If your lives follow the trend from 
your last lives, you guys are gonna be alone for quite a while. 
Setsuna-ch....san told me about her friends though at the time I didn&#39;t 
know you were senshi . About how you were each in love with her for a 
long time, and then were turned down.&quot;

&quot;I am not in love with Setsuna-san!&quot; Rei yelled at her, dropping her 
hands to her sides in fists and Kira grinned.

&quot;You may not be in love with her yet but how long have you known her 
huh? A year or so? And you can&#39;t deny having at least a crush on her. Do 
you really think it&#39;d stay that harmless over the course of 1000 plus 
years?&quot; Rei flushed and crossed her arms again.

&quot;Would you like to deny your crush Ami-chan?&quot; Ami blushed a few shades
deeper than Rei but shook her head. 

&quot;Crushes aren&#39;t exactly unrequited love you know.&quot; Rei snorted and Kira 
smiled softly.

&quot;I said you were in love with her in the last life, not this one. No, in 
this one, you&#39;re in love with the same people you were completely in 
love with in the last one. You, my little ice queen, have once again 
fallen hard for your best friend, the green-eyed goddess of thunder 
herself. Right?&quot; Kira asked Ami, leaning forward from her sitting 
position on the couch. Ami was absolutely adorable when she blushed and 
now was no exception. She didn&#39;t confirm Kira&#39;s statement, only ducked 
her head and clasped her hands together. Kira smiled a bit wider when 
she noticed Rei&#39;s small smile at the girls blush. * With a little help, 
maybe they could help each other... * Kira triumphed inwardly at the 
thought and almost immediately used her powers to fill the air with 
little wisps of lust and love and need that would latch onto the girls&#39; 
subconciousness&#39;s without them even realizing it. Ami, who was still too 
embarrassed to notice Kira&#39;s smile, just concentrated on her shoes. 
*Was I really in love with Makoto in the last life too? Oh dear* 
Deciding that poor Ami had blushed enough, Kira turned on Rei who almost 
jumped in shock.

&quot;And you fire princess, you seem to have repeated your last life, just 
not in the same order. Let&#39;s see. First, a brief crush on someone named 
Mamoru, the Crown Prince I believe? Which is almost immediately if not 
overlapped by a very, very intense love for Usagi who is the princess? 
One quite different from the other girls&#39; love I might add. Then, added 
to that permanent love which you and I know has no hope of coming to 
be, and apparently will stay with you for most of if not all of your 
life comes the crush on Setsuna, though yours is less intense than 
Ami-chan&#39;s. Followed by, and I&#39;m not entirely sure how far into this 
one you are, a slow, growing love for Minako which will turn into a 
permanent love just as strong as your love for Usagi.&quot; Rei, who had 
started to blush as soon as Kira had mentioned Mamoru, had by now 
turned a dark red that surpassed even Ami.

&quot;I...I....I am not in love with Minako.&quot; Rei sputtered in her defense 
and tightened her fists. Sure Minako was beautiful and kind and sweet. 
Sure her eyes were a gorgeous blue and being with her made her about as 
happy as being with Usagi. And sure she had a great body but... Kira 
just cocked her head.

&quot;Yet?&quot; Rei blushed again but sighed and dropped her hands to her sides.

&quot;Yet.&quot; She confirmed and Kira stood to walk in front of her. The little 
wisps were already taking effect which is why when she tilted Rei&#39;s head 
up to meet her eyes, only sadness and longing stared back, and not the 
venomous hatred of just a few minutes ago.

&quot;I can take that pain away you know. Lessen it at the very least. 
Wouldn&#39;t you like to go at least one day without crying Rei-chan? 
Wouldn&#39;t it feel good to be loved?&quot; As she spoke she&#39;d stepped closer to 
Rei, allowing one hand to cup the shorter girl&#39;s cheek. Rei opened her 
mouth to speak but nothing came out so she just settled for staring into 
the mesmerizing eyes of the girl before her.

&quot;How?&quot; Came Ami&#39;s voice from behind her breaking the spell. Shaking it 
off, Rei realized how close she was and stepped back. Unfazed Kira 
stepped a way giving her space and turned to Ami.

&quot;It&#39;s very easy actually. With a bite.&quot;

&quot;A bite?&quot;

&quot;Mmhmm. Vampires have a very unique talent. Much like the mosquito we 
can induce a feeling of numbness when we feed. But we can do so much more 
considering that we are more advanced than an insect. We can induce 
happiness, joy, love, lust. Anything they want. Since I would be taking 
from you, I&#39;d be all too happy to give back.&quot;

&quot;Like a drug? Just a temporary high?&quot; Rei demanded.

&quot;It can be as temporary or as long term as you want.&quot;

&quot;I really don&#39;t feel like living as an emotional zombie. Even if it means 
escaping heartache for a while.&quot; Rei snorted and Ami nodded in agreement. 
Kira laughed a bit.

&quot;For a while? You really don&#39;t know do you? I&#39;m not talking a few years 
here. You are both destined for decades of pain. Setsuna turned you both 
down even though she told me she knew your true love wouldn&#39;t be 
returned for decades, if at all. You are truly lucky in this life. You 
went through all of your crushes in the same short period. Can you 
imagine the hope of falling in love different times over the course of 
your lifetimes and never having anyone love you back? Besides, you 
wouldn&#39;t be zombies. Along with giving feeling, we can take it away. I 
can lessen your attachment to your unrequited loves.

How would it feel to be free of your attachment?&quot;

&quot;You can do that? I... I&#39;ve read about vampires, but I didn&#39;t know that 
was a power too.&quot; Rei asked and Kira smiled at her softly. She&#39;d break 
first. She could feel it. The small bit of hope in her eyes told the 
story. And the lust in the very back of her eyes was also a sign. *Thank 
you horny doujinshi writers for showing the world the wonders of being 
seduced by a vampire* 

&quot;I can do many things with my powers Rei-chan.&quot; Kira responded, dropping 
her voice an octave or two and stepping back up to her. &quot;I can make you 
feel soo good. Even if just for a while. Would you like to feel what 
it&#39;s like Rei-chan? Just a trial run of sorts? Would you like me to 
show you what it feels like to be loved?&quot; She cupped Rei&#39;s cheek and 
again and stared into the raven-haired girls eyes. Rei swallowed hard 
but didn&#39;t look away. 

&quot;I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Kira raised an eyebrow at Rei&#39;s tenacity but smiled 
and shrugged her shoulders, stepping back and releasing her hold on the 
girl.

&quot;Suit yourself. But I&#39;m in no hurry. I can afford to wait for you.&quot; Rei 
growled lightly.

&quot;Wait my ass, take us back now.&quot; Kira just grinned and crossed her arms.

&quot;Do you really think I would go through all the trouble of finding and 
bringing you here if I was just going to let you go like that?&quot; Now Ami 
spoke up.

&quot;And how long do you expect to keep us here?&quot; She asked angrily and Kira 
tilted her head, a thoughtful expression on her face.

&quot;Hmm, as long as it takes I guess.&quot; Ami looked at her in shock and Rei 
nearly stomped her foot.

&quot;It won&#39;t matter how long you keep us here. We&#39;re not just going to give 
in to the person who just kidnapped us.&quot; Rei fumed and Kira quirked a 
grin .

&quot;So what are you going to do? Stay angry at me forever? Think of ways to 
escape? I told you that you don&#39;t have any hope of beating me.&quot; Rei 
clenched her fists and Kira sighed. &quot;Fine, you don&#39;t believe me?&quot; She 
stepped back and spread her arms out. &quot;Go ahead, try and take me.&quot; Ami 
looked suspiciously at her but Rei immediately steepled her fingers and 
began chanting. Then she pulled a ward out and flung it, striking Kira 
on the forehead. Kira was actually shocked to feel a small jolt from the 
paper. *She&#39;s stronger than I thought.* Kira smiled and, almost 
relishing the look of shock in Rei&#39; s eyes, slowly peeled the ward from 
her forehead and let in flutter to the ground, harmless. &quot;I told you.&quot; 
She said to Rei&#39;s shocked face and Ami shook her head. Sensing a 
weakness Kira moved to her. 

&quot;You&#39;ve been in love with Makoto-san for quite a while haven&#39;t Ami-chan?&quot; 
Ami nodded slowly, looking down. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it feel good to have 
someone hold you close, whisper into your ear, look into your eyes and 
tell you how much they care?&quot; Ami shivered but nodded again slowly, 
enveloped by her fantasy of Makoto holding her. Kira stepped up to her 
as she had done with Rei and leaned over, whispering softly into her 
ear. &quot;Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to simply be loved?&quot; 

Ami looked up into Kira&#39;s eyes, caught by the gleam in them and the 
feeling of someone close. * To be loved...* She thought, shivering again. 
Rei was still standing off to the side, fingering her now useless ward, 
too shocked to notice Ami&#39;s predicament and come to her rescue. Kira 
smiled softly at Ami. 

&quot;I could make you feel that way Ami. I could make you feel loved. I could 
hold you like you want to be held. Love you like you need to be loved.&quot; 
She moved closer, slipping an arm around the blue-haired girl. Still 
entranced Ami only moved into the embrace sighing softly, feeling the 
warmth from Kira radiate into her. Kira bent slightly and nuzzled Ami&#39;s 
cheek gently, whispering into her ear. &quot;I could tell you what you want to 
hear Ami-chan. Look at you the way you want to be looked at, touch you 
the way you want to be touched.&quot; As she spoke she slipped her other arm 
around Ami and pulled her tight, letting one of her hands lightly trace 
up and down Ami&#39;s back. Ami whimpered softly and closed her eyes, 
overwhelmed by the feeling of being this close to someone. Her noise 
snapped Rei out of her trance and seeing the slightly glazed look in her 
eyes marched over and pulled Ami from Kira&#39;s hold. Ami looked dazed and 
shook her head to clear it, flushing and getting an annoyed look as she 
realized what Kira had been doing. Kira meerly smiled and stepped back, 
an only somewhat innocent look on her face.

&quot;Knock that off.&quot; Rei commanded and Kira cocked her head to the side, 
grinning as an idea popped up.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what. I&#39;ll go easy on you both if you promise to at least 
try this.&quot; Ami raised her eyebrows and Rei frowned.

&quot;What do you mean?&quot; Kira leaned against a wall and crossed her arms.

&quot;Stay here for a week or two. Give what I&#39;m telling you a chance. Relax, 
take it easy, you could both use a vacation anyway right? Actually try 
to enjoy staying here with me. And if you actually give it a shot 
instead of fighting me the whole time, and after a while you still 
wanna go home, I&#39;ll let you.&quot; Both girls looked shocked and Rei regarded 
the vampire curiously.

&quot;You&#39;ll just let us go?&quot; Kira shrugged lightly and smiled.

&quot;I wanted the two of you because I thought you&#39;d like it here. I wanted 
people I could get along with. If you&#39;re going to hate me for eternity, 
it&#39;s not going to be much fun for any of us. And I know how stubborn 
you can both be. If you make up your minds not to like me, you won&#39;t. 
This way, I get a shot at getting you to relax and actually trying to 
enjoy it here, you get to relax and take a vacation, and if that still 
doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;d be better for all of us if I did let you go.&quot; She 
frowned lightly. &quot;But, I&#39;ll only let you go if you&#39;ve honestly given me 
and my offer a fighting chance. If you snub it off the bat, I&#39;ll keep 
you here until you give in. So, you might as well now, right?&quot; Rei 
looked over at Ami who only shrugged helplessly. 

&quot;We&#39;ll have to discuss it for a moment.&quot; Rei said carefully and Kira 
nodded.

&quot;But of course. I&#39;ll go bring some food okay?&quot; She smiled and walked 
through the sliding door to the kitchen, shutting it behind her as she 
went. Quietly she leaned up against the door and sharpened her vampire 
hearing, latching onto their conversation. She could hear them talking 
to each other about how long they&#39;d each loved so and so. How much a 
vacation would be nice, and how they really didn&#39;t seem to have a choice 
anyway. A tingling sensation pricked the back of Kira&#39;s mind and she 
pulled away from the door, cursing at the rotten sense of timing. A few 
moments later, what could be called her front door opened and Kira 
watched with an annoyed sigh as the tall man walked in. His long white 
ponytail flapped behind him and his lean frame walked with a slant, as 
if he was continuously poising. 

&quot;Kira-chan, my darling. I&#39;ve missed you so.&quot; He declared and Kira rolled 
her eyes as he sauntered over to her, his cape flowing out behind him.

&quot;What do you want Akio-san?&quot; She asked as he leaned against the counter 
near her, his top hat leaning to the side.

&quot;Can&#39;t I just want to see you my dear? It&#39;s been so long, how can you 
treat me this coldly?&quot; She just sighed and shook her head.

&quot;I&#39;m really not in the mood Akio-san.&quot; She said and he sighed 
dramatically, putting his hand over his heart. 

&quot;You wound me so deeply my lovely Kira-chan. You never want to see me 
anymore, you never want to talk like we used to.&quot; He leaned forward and 
did his best to smile seductively at her. A certain scent caught him 
and he grinned slyly at Kira. &quot;Well, no wonder you seem busy, you have 
company.&quot; He said sing-song and moved to look out the door. In a flash 
Kira was in front of it, glaring. He frowned disapprovingly. &quot;Come now 
dearest, if you don&#39;t at least let me look I&#39;m not leaving.&quot; Sighing in 
frustration she opened the door just a little and looked out with him. 
Ami and Rei were sitting down on the couch, leaning to each other and 
talking seriously. &quot;So cute.&quot; He said and she shut the door.

&quot;There, you&#39;ve seen now go. As you can tell I&#39;m quite occupied at the 
moment.&quot; He huffed lightly at her.

&quot;Come now Kira-chan. There are two of them, why not share one? They seem 
so innocent, it couldn&#39;t hurt.&quot; She growled lightly.

&quot;They are innocent Akio-san. And, at least for the moment, I&#39;d like them 
to stay that way.&quot; He sighed and stepped back from her.

&quot;Fine, keep your little toys to yourself. I can get my own. Till another 
day my Dear.&quot; He said and swirled his cape around him, poofing away in 
the same flash of smoke she&#39;d used just a few hours ago. Rolling her 
eyes at his dramatics but breathing a sigh of relief that he had gone 
without too many problems, she finished making the sandwiches and 
carried them into the living room. Rei and Ami were regarding her 
curiously and she smiled, setting the try in front of them.

&quot;Well? Has a decision been made?&quot; She asked. Ami shifted and sat forward 
in her seat.

&quot;We talked it over.&quot; She said carefully.&quot; And we decided...&quot;

&quot;That since we don&#39;t seem to have much of a choice anyway.&quot; Rei added 
annoyed.

&quot;And since a vacation really would be quite nice.&quot; Ami said.

&quot;That we will stay here for a while.&quot; Kira grinned and opened her mouth 
to speak but got no further as Rei continued. &quot;On several conditions.&quot; 
Kira raised her eyebrows curiously. *Conditions? Well, don&#39;t they have 
gusto.* Putting on a serious face she leaned back.

&quot;Very well. State your conditions.&quot; Ami smiled and leaned forward, taking 
a sandwich.

&quot;Condition one. You have to let us talk to our friends and at least let 
us tell them we&#39;re okay.&quot; Rei nodded and tilted her head, regarding Kira 
with a frown.

&quot;Two. No more of this...seductivey stuff okay?&quot; Kira tried hard not to 
smile at that.

&quot;Seductivey stuff?&quot; She asked curiously, teasing Rei. &quot;I&#39;m not sure what 
you mean by that. Could you clarify for me please?&quot; Rei turned red as 
did Ami and shifted in her seat,

&quot;No more trying to, you know, um....&quot; She mumbled something and ducked 
her head, flushing lightly. Ami fidgeted and sighed.

&quot;No more trying to get us to like you and trying to uh, well....&quot; 

&quot;Turn us on.&quot; Rei said, turning a brilliant red that matched Ami. Kira 
grinned and nodded her head.

&quot;Ah, I see. Please continue.&quot;

&quot;And three,&quot; Ami added, recovering form her flush, &quot;you have to let us go 
in no more than two weeks if that is what we choose.&quot; Kira smiled at 
them and nodded her head slightly.

&quot;Very well. I&#39;m sure I can arrange for some way for you to speak with the 
others. I can see why doing that would be high on your list. And, if 
after two weeks you still don&#39;t want to be here, I promise to return 
you, no harm done.&quot; Ami and Rei smiled and settled back until the same 
thing occurred to both of them.

&quot;What about condition number two?&quot; Rei asked and Kira closed her eyes for 
a moment then opened them again and smiled at them both with a feral 
grin.

&quot;I can try but, with two girls like you around, no promises on that one.&quot; 
Ami and Rei both shivered slightly and Kira kept grinning at them until 
Rei leaned forward and picked up a sandwich, biting into it and 
swallowing a fter a few chews.

&quot;Good. We agree then.&quot; Ami munched on her sandwich as well and Kira 
couldn&#39;t help the pleased grin on her face. *They agree with me huh? Boy 
did I pick the right girls.* She thought and watched them smile at each 
other.* Hopefully they&#39;ll keep me from even thinking about Setsuna-san. 
Not ever again* </pre>
