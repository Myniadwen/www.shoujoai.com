<p>Double Shipwreck</p>
<p>“Mina...” Rei groaned as  a hand went up to cover her face, elbows resting on the railing.  “Why? Kami-sama why? There was a reason I told you not to go  into my room...”</p>
<p>“Rei-chan?” When the  Senshi of Fire did not respond, the Princess placed a hand on her  shoulder, questioning, “Do you know what happened?”</p>
<p>After a long string of mumbling curses  under her breath, Rei straightened and looked back at the Zephyr.  “Mina-chan found the box of ammunition I stocked in my room  before I left. It's not heavy artillery, but it can cause a lot of  damage at point blank range.”</p>
<p>“Why...” Setsuna came up  on Rei's other side. “And why is it that you believe  Minako-san is the one responsible for it?”</p>
<p>“She's the captain of the ship  for the rest of this week. Only she can issue a command like that.  That, and she's the only one who would be stupid enough to try it.”</p>
<p>Ami pondered aloud, “Just out of  curiosity, besides the obvious, is there a hidden reason for why  Minako-san might have made a bad decision?”</p>
<p>“That goes without saying. Mars  Crystal Power!”</p>
<p>In a flash of red light, Rei was  replaced by Sailor Mars. Nervously, the Princess whimpered,  “Rei-chan? Just what are you planning on doing?”</p>
<p>“Making sure Mina knows what  happens when she attacks the ship <em>I'm</em> on. Mars...”</p>
<p>Realizing what Rei  was planning, Setsuna objected, “Mars! Wait- don't! That's a  wooden ship-!”</p>
<p>But Mars ignored  her as she pulled back the string of her flaming bow. “...Flame  Sniper!”</p>
<p>Arrow released,  they could only watch as the arrow caught the speck that was Mina,  and tacked her to the burning cabin wall by the hem of her shirt.  Squealing with surprise, frustration, and a tint of fear, Mina tossed  and turned and struggled to get out of the fire's wrath, even as  Makoto came around the corner and doused the fire with one giant  bucket of water.</p>
<p>But fire,  especially that borne from Mars, is rather stubborn, even when  against it's natural foe, water. Thus so, even after backing mostly  out of the water's line of offense, it regained its territory,  quickly spreading in its quest for the conquest of oxygen.</p>
<p>Mercury, computer  analyzer covering her eyes, quickly assessed the situation and set  about an attempt to rectify it. “Mercury... Aqua Rhapsody!”</p>
<p>Whilst a good  majority of the patrons' attention was on the horizontal torrent of  water crashing from one ship to the other, Mercury breathlessly  explained, “I hope that wasn't too late. If that fire ignites  the remainder of the gun-”</p>
<p>A nuclear bomb  could not have been set off quicker than the resulting explosion that  obliterated both ships in one blast. Of course, given the fact that  nuclear weapons had yet to be formed, such a comparison would be hard  to prove. Suffice to say, the explosion looked like an infantile  Godzilla's plate of cauliflower, wilted and smoking from his bad  breath.</p>
<p>The Princess,  despite being the ditz that she most commonly portrayed, managed to  do some split-second decision making, whipping out the Crystal and  preserving both sets of crew members. As they were keeping float by  holding onto various forms of debris, Neptune used her influence to  convince the waves to carry them to the closest piece of land, while  Uranus manipulated the winds to blow the smoke and bad air away from  them, lest they die of pollution rather than drowning or an accident  before their time was up.</p>
<p>Separated from her  peers as the wooden planks had collapsed from underneath, Mars  hastily looked around for a familiar face. For the sake of calling,  she shouted, “Princess! Mina! Where are you!”</p>
<p>A few moments  later, she heard more than saw a clutter of bubbles on the surface of  the water, before the Princess' head bobbed up. Seeing as how she  had nothing to hold onto, Mars swam over to her and proffered the  other end of the railing she was gripping. She took it gratefully,  before looking around to see what she could find of the others.</p>
<p>For having sunk so  close to each other, Mars found it rather startling how far apart  they all were. Certainly, she could see the outline of pinpricks  that was the rest of the crew, and the soaked fukus that revealed the  locations of the Senshi, but they were still only that- pinpricks.  Regardless, she and the Princess managed to drift onto a deserted  beach, and voluntarily climbed to higher ground in an attempt to  prevent the current from taking them back out to sea. Looking around  once more, Mars confirmed what her mind told her she should have  known based on instinct: they were alone on a deserted beach.</p>
<p>Meanwhile,  approximately a five kilometer radius from any other survivors, a  zonked out Venus, and a body-bearing Pluto succeeded in collapsing on  the bank. Further along the perimeter of the same island, Jupiter  and Mercury emerged from the waters. Safely tucked in between the  midpoint of the area between Jupiter/Mercury and Princess/Mars, was  the duo of Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>I'd end there,  but that'd be cruel, and an utter waste of a chapter, now wouldn't  it? Instead, be patient whilst I rotate the pairings, ne? Don't  worry, it will still be Minako/Rei and Usagi/Mamoru... for the most  part. ;) ---</p>
<p align="center">A$# &amp;  °;o;° (Ash/Pyro and Meatball-head/Crybaby/Gluttonous Pig)</p>
<p>“Ugh... I think I could have  lived without a near point blank explosion of that size.” Mars  wrung out the majority of water in her hair, which had come out of  its braid in the tussle of water and wind, while she inquired,  “Princess? Are you all right?”</p>
<p>To which a low wail colored the  response. Turning with an annoyed glare, Mars was about to berate  the Princess for being a crybaby- out of instinct and habit- before  she really caught sight of her companion. She nearly choked in an  attempt to hold in her laughter, which still broke out after a few  seconds.</p>
<p>The white dress that now clung to her  like a second skin had taken on a ragged flare, as if it had snared  sharp thorns or rocks underneath the water. The moon-shaped earrings  seemed to have been nearly ripped from her ears in the current,  leaving two bare, red ears. Her eyes were screwed up in that way  when she was needlessly whiny, but still felt some sort of negative  emotion ranging from sad, to bad, to mad (though the latter was very  rare in and of itself). The most comical feature of all, however,  had to be the hair. A large patch of red seaweed had settled on the  crown of her head, with the long snakes of blond hair wrapping around  it. Even with a pair of soggy spherical ornaments, the scene upon  the Princess' head looked very much indeed like a plate of spaghetti  and meatballs.</p>
<p>Once the laughter subsided, Mars  crawled over and carefully untangled hair from seaweed, and set about  squeezing the excess amount out of her Princess' hair. At the  absence of teasing, the Princess blinked hard on her tears, and  looked up to watch Mars' deft movements. After a few moments, a  notion occurred to her that she felt was worthy of mention.</p>
<p>“Rei...?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Aren't you going to  detransform?”</p>
<p>As Mars undid the Princess'  “meatballs,” she shook her head softly. “Nah, see-  my hair's still drying. I'll light up a little bonfire later to help  it along, but for now, I want to make sure it's dry enough to not  effect my normal outfit before I lose the already wet uniform.  You... I don't know... maybe we'll go find some large leaves to cover  you while your dress dries. You'll catch a cold at this rate, you  know.”</p>
<p>“Are you... don't you worry  about how the others are?”</p>
<p>“I think I would have noticed a  significant change in your expressions if anything bad happened to  any of them. I can sense it too- they're all fine. Waterlogged,  maybe, but fine.”</p>
<p>After waiting another few minutes for  the silence to settle, the Princess interrupted it again. “Why  are you being so nice to me? You aren't normally like this...”</p>
<p>“Mmm... I don't know, really. I  just don't feel like it, I suppose. But really, I'm serious about  you getting a cold if you stay in wet clothes for long. Just-”   Mars paused as she finished putting up the second sphere of hair.  “There. All right, come on, meatball head, let's go find you  some suitable 'garments'. Who knows? We might even find another  living soul here.”</p>
<p>“...Soul? Like as in 'ghost'?”</p>
<p>At the tension that suddenly grew from  the Princess' grasp, Mars laughed lightly and shook her head. “Soul  as in still intact with a living body. Like the other Senshi?”</p>
<p>As they traipsed into the somewhat  dense forestry that always seems to accompany a previously  uninhabited island, Mars lit a small flame in the palm of her hand,  allowing it to warm both of their bodies and clothes. Apparently  unable to let the silence prevail, as well as a growing desire to  make use of her companion's currently gentle nature, no matter how  short it would be, the Princess asked, “So is it true? Are you  really in love with Mina-chan?”</p>
<p>The flame wavered momentarily as a  blush came unbidden to Mars' cheeks. Taking a deep, calming breath,  she responded, “Yes. And it's a mutual feeling.”</p>
<p>“How do you know?”</p>
<p>“She told me.”</p>
<p>“No, I mean how do you <em>know</em>?   Like how <em>you</em> feel?”</p>
<p>There was a short  pause mid-step as Mars contemplated the question, but soon answered,  “I don't know... it's the Senshi of Love... with her... you  just know. There's no 'how' to it.”</p>
<p>“Mmm...”   The Princess hummed as she rocked back and forth on her heels,  leaving her with a strange gait to her walk. Eventually, she  whispered, “I'm happy for you.”</p>
<p>At that, Mars  blinked in surprise. Upon further digestion of the words, she  sighed. “Thank you... I suppose. From you, I wouldn't expect  much of anything else, but you wouldn't happen to know why Setsuna  is... uncertain about it, do you?”</p>
<p>Mentally, the  Princess nodded, portrayed outwardly by a small tilt of her head.  “Of course I do. Isn't it obvious? Mina-chan is the leader of  the Senshi- er... well, from what Mother told me, she's technically  only the leader of the Inner Senshi, but the Outers will probably  listen to her... if we're all together. Anyways... besides the whole  girl-girl thing, I think it's mostly because having a relationship  might- in the words of Luna- 'deflect your duty of protecting the  Princess in favor of protecting the Senshi you love'.” At  that, the Princess sighed and shrugged. “If you know me, you  know if you can find love, I'll back you all the way, especially  considering we're in this for the long haul. I don't want you to  spend all that time just looking after me- especially considering I  have Mamo-chan, but... you know, traditionalists will always be  traditionalists. Now if you could get the others to 'follow in your  footsteps', you might win the case based on a majority ruling of the  Senshi...”</p>
<p>“If the  leader was the first of the 'revolution', wouldn't that be biased  then? Of course she'd judge in her own favor.”</p>
<p>The Princess  chuckled nervously. “I suppose that means they'd pick someone  else as judge hmm? Bah, you're either all for it, or completely  against it- if you aren't either, than you're probably too indecisive  to make a decision.”</p>
<p>“Maybe...”  Mars let out a soft laugh. “Maybe we can propose a new Senshi  law to be passed for Mina's birthday... or mine come to think of it.”</p>
<p>“Sure, if we  can get back by then. Rei-chan... just how are we supposed to get  back home without <em>either</em> of our ships?”</p>
<p>Rei looked over at  her Princess as her Fire whined for a burst of more energy. “I  doubt you'll like the prospects, Princess.”</p>
