<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Complete<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  icy glares were as cold as the angry winds that tore down the craggy  rock walls of the dark side of the moon. Still, Sailor Mars stood  protectively in front of the mist enshrouded form of the wounded Venus.  She would not allow her counterpart access to the memory that she  guarded.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian warrior’s gloved hands tightened into fists.  “Why have you returned? You need not access this memory in order to  find the answers you so seek.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned at the woman’s vague  riddles and circuitous conversation. After spending the majority of her  morning in pursuit of this well hidden memory, she was determined that  Mars would hold her back no longer. “Because I can remember every  memory before this one. I have to know how this one ends. Why do you  stop me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should know that best,” the raven haired woman sneered, “after all, it was <em>you</em> who locked your memories away, leaving yourself to guard it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me? Why would I do such a thing?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  protect your reincarnated self; the memories of your relationship with  Venus and its disastrous end were hidden away,” Mars’ tone was  righteous, but then her dark eyes narrowed, “that is, until you  tampered with the lock.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko was unfazed by her counterpart’s venom. “And I’ve regained them all except for this one. I must know why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you really pry open something so tightly locked, Princess of Mars?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  the first time, Rei faltered. “I… I need this memory to be complete. I  have to know how this one memory relates to my current self.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But was it not you who claimed that the past was irrelevant?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  the revelation of her contradiction, Rei stood with her mouth ajar.  Although her mirror image was calling her a hypocrite, Mars seemed to  take some amount of pity on her, and with a slight smirk, she baited  Rei, “Only you hold the key to unlock the pain that I have shielded you  from all this time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Stop talking in riddles!” Rei’s outburst  was more than she’d expected of herself, and it took her last ounce of  patience to rein her anger in. Through ground teeth, she asked, “What  is this key?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The standoffish warrior advanced slowly, closing  the distance between their nearly identical images. “Do you really need  me to tell you what you hold most dear to your heart, Mars Reiko-san?”  Her last words were a whisper as her pained eyes implored Rei’s own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What I hold most dear…” Rei’s words trailed off distractedly as her mind instantly homed in on one thing, one person.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In  her mind’s eye, she saw Minako, just the night before, the two of them  curled up and facing each other on the singer’s bed. Arms wrapped  around each other, they traded gentle kisses and light touches until  they fell asleep in each other’s embrace…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that wonderful  image dissolved all too quickly, and suddenly, she was standing under a  black, starless sky beneath the angled roof of a stadium. She was numb,  unseeing, unfeeling. She could feel her friends at her back, their  question was obvious; <em>where was their leader?</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then,  her voice was raw and not her own, and when the flames of Mars ignited  her transformation, she briefly wondered if the flames of her fury  would eat her alive. She wasn’t so lucky. Instead, she attacked with a  ferocity she hadn’t been capable of harnessing ever before, and when  their foes had been eliminated, she had felt herself shaking like a  leaf as she fell to her knees, crying out <em>her</em> name,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Mi…na…ko!”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  eyes widened and to her surprise, Sailor Mars turned a shoulder,  granting her the slightest view of the crumpled form of the broken  Sailor Venus. Face down on the bloodied ground, her golden hair caked  with dust and blood, porcelain skin bruised and bloodied, those wide  blue eyes frozen in fear…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Minako… died first…</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  before Rei could completely grasp the meaning of her thought, her world  spun wildly. The craggy rock walls and the darkness of the sky blended  into a swirl, and when she could open her eyes again, she was in  another time and place that seemed to <em>precede</em> the memory that Sailor Mars guarded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>After  escaping the planet’s gravitational field, the blue orb of the Earth  continued to recede. The roar of the afterburners cut off and the pulse  engines took over. The stars drifted by lazily, but a wired tension  filled the air in the small cabin of the transport shuttle. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Are you sure you’re alright?” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>To  the untrained ear, the terse voice may have sounded more angry than  worried, but Minako knew better. For her lover’s sake, Sailor Venus -  disguised as Princess Serenity - shook off the grogginess in her head  and granted Mars a half smirk. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Un. I’m just tired from  the debating. Even though my senshi strength aides my disguise, posing  as Serenity is exhausting, I’ll have you know. I mean, I yes, it was  too risky to send her to Earth, but do you know how hard it is to act  as persistently optimistic as Serenity?”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Mars crossed her arms and snorted. “Well you manage to pull off her ‘dumb as a rock’ moments just fine.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The  Martian’s cold demeanor slipped into a slight smile as Venus punched  her lightly in the arm. Even though they shared a brief giggle, the  long haired warrior could not relax. The three days of intense  deliberations hosted on Earth regarding the impending threat of a  faceless adversary named Metallia and the appearance of rogue bands of  youma that had been threatening the Moon Kingdom had proven not only  fruitless as to the how’s, why’s, and even who’s of their adversary,  but had been severely taxing on her leader, disguised as the Princess  of the Moon Kingdom. And though Mars had stood by her side as her aide  through its entirety, she could do nothing but watch worriedly as Venus  seemed to fall victim to a debilitating exhaustion. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>But  mostly, it was the feeling of wrongness that seemed to trail after them  the further they got from that blue planet that bothered Mars the most.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>A  golden glow suddenly filled the cabin with an ethereal light, and Mars  realized that Venus was letting her disguise slip. She was caught  speechless as the image of Serenity gently faded into the beauty of  Minako, her eyes slightly shut, the soft features of her face finally  relaxed, but when the golden glow subsided, Mars’ unease spiked.</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Minako!” She shouted, quickly kneeling before her leader’s seat where she was doubled over in pain and clutching her head. </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She’s going to leave me.’</em> Minako mused as she watched the eerily still form of the miko where she concentrated before the sacred flame. <em>‘She going to remember what I put her through back then and its relation to the future, and she’s going to leave me.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  high hopes of stealing her best friend for the day, the singer had  arrived unannounced some time earlier. But when she’d walked in on Rei  deep in meditation and obviously chasing the one memory of her past  that Minako had hoped she’d never recover, the singer had been filled  with fear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sitting on her knees at the back of the fire room,  Minako anxiously worried her bottom lip, her hands fidgeting in her lap  as she kept watch for the slightest reason to interrupt the miko’s  vision. Finally, her fear mounted until she could no longer contain it,  and when Rei opened her mouth in a silent scream, the singer had  launched herself across the room.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei! Rei!” On the verge of tears, Minako shook the miko’s stiff form, ever conscious of their proximity to the dancing fire.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  several fluttering blinks, Rei’s dark eyes finally opened. And although  she was quite pleased to find herself in Minako’s embrace, she was also  quite irked to have her vision interrupted by the singer for a second  time in as many days.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark eyes narrowed as Minako’s emotions slammed into Rei. The miko didn’t need to be psychic to understand how the singer felt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You really don’t want me to remember this, do you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  words were neither angry or annoyed, but more a contemplative analysis  as she compared Minako’s hesitance to Sailor Mars’ outright refusal.<em> ‘What are they so afraid of?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… I…” Minako’s lower lip quivered ever so slightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you really trust me so little?” Upset that Minako would think so little  of her, Rei’s words carried a harsher edge than the miko had expected.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was an edge that so obviously cut her best friend, but it was too late to take it back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer’s teeth clacked shut, her jaw set firmly, and her lips formed a  thin, white line. Her caramel eyes dropped to the floor wordlessly.  Like a vine falling victim to the winter frost, her hold around Rei  loosened before it withered altogether. Slowly, she stood, her hands  clenched to her side.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako paused for the briefest moment – on the edge of that split second decision between fight or flight…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She chose the latter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  bothering with her hat or shades that served as her disguise, too  distraught to even remember to pick up the umbrella she’d brought,  Minako had run out into the late winter rain like a petulant teen.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  bumbled down the shrine steps, nearly taking several disastrous  tumbles, but she managed to keep her feet until she hit the sidewalk.  The cars that zoomed by on the wet pavement were deafening to her  ringing ears as she ran along the walkway, but still, she ran blindly.  Finally, with wide eyes, her vision distorted by the rain and her  tears, she ran out of breath in the middle of a soaked and deserted  park.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When her adrenaline had finally left her limp, Minako’s  teeth chattered and her arms hugged her slim and shaking frame. She was  freezing. She was wet. But mostly, she was scared. Scared of what Rei  would think when she fully understood how their past had ended… and its  correlation to the present.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Hypocrite!’</em> She scolded  herself. And it was true. Five years ago, it had been she who had been  so concerned about their past. It had been she who had wanted nothing  other than for Mars to regain her memories of their time together…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  where Minako had been so attached to the past in hopes that it would  reunite she and Rei, now she was worried that it might tear them apart,  for Rei wouldn’t like what she’d seen in Venus Minako anymore than she  liked what she’d seen from Aino Minako five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>I  should just leave. Now. Before I hurt her even more. So I don’t have to  see the disappointment in her eyes. I’ll go back to London. Paris. New  York…’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But then, that small part of Minako, the small flame  of rebellion against her martyrdom that Rei had breathed life into five  years earlier, spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>And let her go after we’ve gotten so close when I could be next to her side, fighting to keep her instead?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  as Minako the martyr and the Minako of free will fought for dominance,  the drenched and frightened woman continued to shake in the rain.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Although  she knew she’d hurt her, Minako’s interruption hadn’t derailed Rei, but  had only served to spur her forward. And although it had pained the  miko to see the tears in her best friend’s caramel eyes as she ran from  her, Rei had quickly found herself standing before Sailor Mars once  more, her jaw set and determined to finish this once and for all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘At least <em>I</em> never made her cry like that.” Mars scowled, the concealing mists  churning behind her form. “Perhaps you should give up now, Princess.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s  hackles rose at the barb her mirror image threw at her, but she forced  her pride to take the blow. Ignoring the comment, she focused on the  last memory she was trying to piece together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We didn’t know it then, but Metallia had invaded Venus’ mind before we left Earth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Dark eyes narrowed and the Martian senshi nodded. “Very intuitive, Princess of Mars.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She  was trying to protect our Princess by posing as her, but it was that  very disguise that lured that… that monster. And she suffered with that  evil presence in her mind until… until…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mars crossed her arms with a rightful smirk. “Always the martyr, wouldn’t you say?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  glared at the warrior, vindicated and yet hurt at the same time. She  couldn’t deny that Minako’s selfless ways often made her seem the  martyr. It was the one thing that had bothered her the most about the  Minako of her own time. But it would be too easy to take Mars’ bait,  and the miko decided not to play to her childish whims. Arguing the  point wouldn’t help her in uncovering the events that linked this  hidden memory to her memory of the end of the Silver Millennium. An  event she knew all too clearly did not include the role of Venus…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’ve had enough.” Rei growled. “Step aside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As though she’d been able to sense Rei’s determination, Sailor Mars lifted an eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  said step aside!” Rei’s voice shook the craggy canyon walls, and  finally, Sailor Mars took a hesitant step backwards. Indecision flashed  through the warrior’s stormy eyes until slowly, the mists that  enshrouded the background receded, and then, the Martian senshi  disappeared altogether.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A surge of red-orange light and a rush of  power through her system told Rei she was Sailor Mars once more, and  finally, the form that had been hidden behind her came into view again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A raspy whimper escaped Mars’ lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Face  down on the bloodied ground, Venus’ golden hair was caked with dust and  blood. Her porcelain skin was bruised and bloodied. Those wide caramel  eyes were open and unseeing…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mars’ body, frozen with fear and  anxiety, finally snapped. Bonelessly, she fell to her knees. With shaky  limbs, she managed to crawl across the blood soaked rock to her leader.  In her heart, she knew what she’d find, but she couldn’t bring herself  to admit it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She was too late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her warm hands wrapped  around the cold skin of Venus’ arms and she flipped her commander onto  her back and pulled her into her chest. Mars’ breath hitched in her  throat as a shaky hand traced around Venus’ unseeing eyes and the  blackened, bruised skin of her cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Like a mantra, the Martian  warrior called the name of her past lover over and over, her faltering  voice breaking between a scream and a cry. “Minako! Minako! Minako!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  sensed them before she felt them at her back; strong arms pulling her  away, supporting voices calling her name. The similarities to Minako’s  end in her current life were blinding as her friends; Sailor Moon,  Sailor Mercury, and Sailor Jupiter crowded her, as shocked and appalled  at the sight of their dead leader, but also wholly concerned for Mars’  well being.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She threw off Serenity once, in a blind need to  return to Venus’ side. Mars’ arms tightened around Venus’ torso, her  head dropped to her lovers’ chest. It was only Jupiter’s gentle, but  insistent strength that managed to pull her away from their leader’s  cold body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With her comrades surrounding her, it was only the Rei  inside the Sailor Mars that was reliving this terrible memory who  barely noticed that even as her own voice screamed Minako’s name one  last time, Sailor Moon, who had staggered off to the side, fell to her  knees and clutched her head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The door to the fire room  slid open, nearly bouncing off its hinges as the rain soaked singer  bolted into the room just in time to catch the miko who had pitched  forward out of exhaustion. Minako was across the room before Rei could  hit the ground, gathering the other woman in her arms and pulling her  towards her shaking frame.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly, the miko’s eyes fluttered  open, and when her dark orbs recognized the only person she had wanted  to see, a slight, pained smile tugged at her hesitant lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Twice.”  Rei’s voice was hoarse as though she’d been screaming for far too long  and Minako found herself nervously threading her fingers through her  best friend’s bangs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Twice what?” She gently prodded, though she was afraid of the answer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko’s dark eyes squinted, as though she were still trying to comprehend the situation. “You left me… back then, too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  frowned a moment until she realized that Rei had meant that she had  died back then, but it was that intimate wording the miko used that  brought tears to the singer’s eyes. Minako was speechless, she was  afraid, but she was also touched. Still, ashamed, Minako turned her  head sharply away. Her brow creased and her lower lip trembled, and it  didn’t stop even when Rei’s steadying hand cupped her chin and made her  look at her once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Back then, I had sensed something… but I didn’t <em>know</em>. I didn’t know it was Metallia.“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  haunted look in Rei’s eyes told Minako that Reiko, and even Rei  herself, had felt guilt for Venus Minako’s death, that perhaps given  her psychic powers, she should have been able to stop the inevitable.  Slowly, her hand traveled along Rei’s own where it gently cupped her  face, and leaning into that hand, the singer found strength.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  was my fault, Rei,” Minako’s confession was a pained whisper, “none of  us knew it was Metallia. And even once I understood something was  irreversibly wrong, I still brushed off your concern. I wouldn’t let  you worry about me because somehow, I knew it was too late. Even though  I wanted to believe that I could have managed it, I could have defeated  the darkness inside me. But I failed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako…” Rei’s voice trailed off as the singer’s tears coursed over her hand on her cheek, so hot over her chilled skin.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And  through Serenity,” Minako continued, “Metallia wiped out all life in a  blink of an eye. It was my fault, and in an essence, I was the only one  to really witness it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned, “but you were dead.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s eyes darted to the floor. “My soul… lingered.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer could feel the miko’s dark eyes on her, could feel the intensity  of emotion she exuded, and she found the courage to look at her once  more, even as her tears ran anew. “I couldn’t help it. I wasn’t ready  to leave… you. I had to make sure I knew you were okay. But all I could  do was watch as the product of my mistake killed not only you, but  everyone else that I loved. Perhaps it was what drove me to be such a  harsh leader this time around. I wanted to make sure I didn’t make the  same mistake a second time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko frowned, her dark eyes  hardened, and suddenly, Rei understood everything. From Minako’s  heightened sense of martyrdom to the reason behind nearly every single  one of her leader’s actions that had infuriated her five years ago.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then, Rei accepted it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Pull yourself together.” She demanded of her best friend harshly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Minako’s tears ground to a halt with a sniffle and a confused  expression, Rei continued. “You did what you thought was best as our  leader. Don’t you <em>dare</em> regret your actions now. It’s that very attitude that saved our asses time again, in this life and the last. It’s what we <em>all</em> expected of you,” the miko paused to smirk at Minako, “even if it <em>is</em> irritating sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  caramel eyes could only stare at Rei with wonder. That she could  forgive such a fatal flaw in her character when she’d expected the miko  to thoroughly shun her… it was too much for her to hope for. A small,  tentative smile cracked her frown, and when Rei met her with the most  honest of understanding smiles, a full fledged grin devolved into a  chuckling laugh as Minako pulled her best friend closer to her, burying  her head in Rei’s collarbone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women comforted each other;  half laughing, half crying, and in the process, they washed away the  invisible wounds left from battles that dated back more than a  millennium, until finally, they ran out of tears and chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne,”  Rei finally asked tentatively, her voice almost hoarse from entirely  too much use, “do you think that Metallia’s influence on your previous  life contributed to your illness five years ago?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko managed to absorb Minako’s unconscious shiver. “I’ve suspected as much.” The singer admitted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry,”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,” Minako said firmly, “<em>I’m</em>… sorry. I didn’t want you to have to re-live that. Any of it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  dark haired woman caressed Minako’s cheek. “But I did.” She said  softly, “And you came back, didn’t you? And I’m still here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  knew Minako was apt to overreacting - as demonstrated by her avoiding a  discussion about the memory Rei was trying to trace and subsequently  running away - but at the same time, the miko knew how hard it must  have been for the singer to return. Sailor Mars was right; Minako could  play the martyr, but that’s not to say that deep down inside, Minako  wasn’t just like her – a scared and fragile woman who didn’t want to  get hurt. Blank expressions examined each other until Minako finally  nodded with a slight smile, which Rei returned.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Everything’s  going to be okay, right?” Despite her excitement and happiness at what  had just occurred, Minako was surprised to find a hint of uncertainty  in her voice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s smile faded slightly. “You tell me,” she said  critically as she examined Minako’s unsure expression, “because  something’s still bothering you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako cursed her transparency.  How could she let her vulnerabilities be detected when they’d just made  such progress? She didn’t like the turn their conversation had taken;  from candy-land happy endings that wrapped up their past life to the  fact that she still felt that something was missing from their  relationship in this one.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And she owed Rei an explanation. “Maybe  it’s just strange the way we’re talking things out and telling each  other our feelings. We’ve never done that. You’re like me, you make  your decisions internally and keep things inside until you can’t take  it anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei had also sensed the dark turn of their  conversation and tried not to be too confrontational, sensing she was  wandering into touchy territory but not really understanding why.  “Well, maybe I’ve already made my decisions.” She said, and it was  true, but now she was achingly aware that she hadn’t even <em>talked</em> about any of them to Minako. And maybe she should have, but was now the right time?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Perhaps we know each other too well.” She said offhandedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  we?” Minako asked, her frown an apparent disapproval of her best  friend’s last comment. “Then why don’t I know what you’re going to do  next?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was at a loss, and in the disapproving eyes of Minako,  she felt a churning mixture of warring emotions. With no amount of  uncertainty, Rei knew just how deep her feelings for Minako ran; just  how very much Minako was a part of her. And looking at the woman who  embraced her, how could Rei feel anything but complete?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But what was <em>complete?</em> Was it that four-letter word? A word used entirely too often that had  lost its meaning? A word that the miko had feared that she didn’t even  have the capacity for feeling? That was what Minako wanted, wasn’t it?  Rei was sure of it. But was that what she felt?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She could use that word; right here, right now, and quell the fears she knew Minako harbored.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But would she be telling the truth?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  as much progress as they’d made together, there was still so much left  unsaid, not just about their feelings for one another, but about their  lives in general. When could one use that four letter word and be sure  that they meant it?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was scared. And she didn’t want to admit  it. And she knew she was waiting entirely too long to answer Minako. So  she did the only thing she knew how. She closed her eyes, leaned  forward, and concentrated on putting every last ounce of herself into  one perfect kiss that she pressed to Minako’s lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And it was enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer closed her eyes and surrendered to Rei’s kiss. She submitted to  her emotions. And in those emotions, Minako believed she found what she  was looking for, and in return, the doubt she had felt was gently  washed away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But when they broke for air, the moment was ruined.  Rei’s gentle smile slipped and a frown turned at the corners of her  mouth. “You’re all wet!” She exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s brow creased. “You mean you only just noticed?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Bleh!” The miko exclaimed as she realized she, herself was rather cold and damp thanks to the runaway singer.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s laughter was music to Rei’s ears as her best friend pulled her closer the harder she mockingly struggled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">What’s  that you say? Not quite the happy ending you were looking for? That’s  because it’s not over yet. I’d guess that I gave you enough here to see  that Rei and Minako still have one or two major hurdles to jump over  together.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So, I kinda have to apologize. I feel the build up for  Venus’ end in the Silver Millennium may have been a little overrated.  She died by sacrificing herself to Metallia and by not telling anyone,  in a way she caused Serenity to succumb to the darkness. It was bad,  yes, but it was really just the fact that it was the mirror image of  her future self’s death that hurt Rei so bad. You know, the whole  martyrdom thing when she had a perfectly willing and able Rei by her  side each time to help her? Yeah, that.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Also, for those of you  who were expecting more trouble than what I gave our two main  characters, I have to say, I don’t play the make up/break up game very  well. I kind of wish I did, to make disagreements more dramatic, but I  just feel like it wouldn’t have worked real well here.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Chapter 12 Preview:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Hikawa Shrine had been everything to Rei after her mother had died and  her father had abandoned her, and she had served its cause as a loyal  miko up until the last four years. It had been the shrine’s  proprietor’s greatest wish to see her serve as its Priestess, but he  had still been happy for her to find that the Kyoto-Yama Shrine had  recruited her first. She only hoped that she would have some time to  breathe and meditate before she had to give her final answer to the  Kyoto-Yama Shrine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-sama?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko stopped, closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. Somehow she knew, she wouldn’t be so lucky. “Yes, Yuki-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You have a phone call in the office.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko nodded. Reluctantly, she changed direction, stepped into the small  office, and slid the screen door shut behind her. She picked up the  phone and set it to her ear, hoping the cool plastic would ease her  sweating temple.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hino Rei desu.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san, we need your answer.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”My answer…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi folded her hands and leaned across the table, peaking the singer’s interest immediately.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Minako-chan? I know Rei-chan’s not really telling anyone about it yet, but <em>you’ve</em> got to have some information…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">a  scandalous smile on her face, Minako raised an eyebrow and tilted her  head, interested to find out how her subtle as a train wreck friend  would ask the question she’d been inevitably waiting for,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“has Rei accepted the Priestess position yet?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The… what?”</span></p>
