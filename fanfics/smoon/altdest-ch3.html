<h1>Altered Destinies (part 3 of 22)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/altdest-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Ami struggled to get free of the grip on her head, even as the 
creature scowled down at her. &quot;Why can&#39;t I drain your energy?&quot; she 
complained bitterly. She casually tossed Ami aside, &quot;You&#39;re no use to 
me.&quot;

Ami watched the creature attacking Sailor Moon, flinging paper 
sharpened like blades at the young heroine. &#39;I&#39;ve got to help her,&#39; 
she looked around her wildly.

&quot;I hate tests,&quot; Sailor Moon wailed, sprawling to dodge yet another 
attack.

&quot;Get up,&quot; Luna urged her.

&quot;Eeep!&quot; Sailor Moon barely ducked another sheet. &quot;I&#39;m a little busy 
just dodging,&quot; she scowled at Luna.

Ami sighed softly even as she thought, &#39;I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m doing 
this.&#39; With a mighty swing she brought the computer keyboard down on 
the transformed teacher&#39;s head, sending her crashing to the ground. 
&quot;Now Sailor Moon,&quot; Ami cried.

&quot;Moon Tiara Magic!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out, hurling her tiara at the 
stunned villainess. In a flash of light, she was a pile of moon dust. 
Sailor Moon returned her tiara to it&#39;s rightful place and smiled at 
Ami, &quot;Nicely done.&quot;

&quot;Have we met before?&quot; Ami peered at Sailor Moon and Luna thoughtfully, 
&quot;You both look sort of familiar, somehow.&quot;

&quot;No, no, sorry, I must have that kind of face,&quot; Sailor Moon 
sweatdropped, bolting from the room at top speed.

Ami watched her go, shaking her head. She guided the recovered 
students outside, then considered calling her mother for a ride home.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Usagi cried, running down the sidewalk towards her. She tripped 
on a crack in the pavement, skinning her knees and breaking out in 
tears, &quot;Whaa!&quot;

Ami just had to smile, &quot;Are you all right?&quot; She took Usagi&#39;s elbow, 
gently pulling her up to her feet when the light hit the blonde girl&#39;s 
face just right. It was like a revelation struck her. &#39;She&#39;s Sailor 
Moon,&#39; Ami looked at her in shock.

&quot;I&#39;m all right,&quot; Usagi brushed off her legs mournfully. She noticed 
Ami&#39;s odd expression, &quot;What&#39;s wrong? Did I get something on my face?&quot;

&quot;No, I just got distracted,&quot; Ami blushed.

Usagi and Ami talked for a while, even as she looked at her and 
wondered how she could be so very sure. But she was, somehow. Even 
stranger, once they split up, Ami felt compelled to follow her. She 
saw Usagi walk for a bit, then a sports car pulled up. A woman who was 
so attractive she had to be a model opened the passenger side door, 
Usagi climbed in, and they were gone.

&quot;Curiouser and curiouser,&quot; Ami murmured.

Minako smiled across the seat at Usagi, &quot;Not bad.&quot; She drove with 
skill, part of her attention on the road, the rest on her passenger, 
&quot;But I&#39;d like to see what else we can do with your tiara. I don&#39;t like 
the fact that once you throw it, you&#39;re defenseless.&quot;

Usagi looked over at her in surprise, &quot;You saw?&quot;

&quot;I was watching from outside, just in case,&quot; Minako shrugged. She 
frowned, &quot;I&#39;ll let you and Luna into the house, then I have to go pick 
up Natsuna. We&#39;ll be right back, OK?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; Usagi smiled. Minako smoothly pulled in front of the 
house, got out, and led Usagi to the door.

&quot;Is Artemis home?&quot; Luna asked suddenly, her tail flicking back and 
forth.

&quot;Yes,&quot; Minako looked over at Luna thoughtfully. She unlocked the door 
and Artemis greeted Luna happily, the two walking off together, tails 
swaying. &quot;What&#39;s with them?&quot; Minako frowned.

Usagi shrugged, &quot;She&#39;s been twitchy all day.&quot; Minako took off, and 
Usagi settled down on the couch to wait.

Natsuna came down the steps of the police station and smiled on seeing 
Minako waiting there. &quot;Thanks, love,&quot; Natsuna bent over to give her a 
gentle kiss.

A group of passing officers hooted and howled, and Minako yelled good 
naturedly, &quot;Don&#39;t you have anything better to do?&quot;

They drove home talking quietly. &quot;So has Usagi figured out yet that 
we&#39;re more than just friends?&quot; Natsuna asked.

Minako shrugged, &quot;I&#39;m not sure.&quot; A soft sigh, &quot;And I&#39;m not entirely 
sure if I should just tell her or not.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s a good kid,&quot; Natsuna noted even as they pulled in front of 
their house.

Minako pulled the front door open, and froze. &quot;Do you hear that?&quot; she 
asked.

Muffled, as if the voices had passed through several closed doors, 
&quot;Yes! Yes! Oh, harder, harder!&quot;

Minako and Natsuna looked at each other, wide eyed. &quot;You don&#39;t think 
she found a naughty videotape, or something?&quot; Natsuna asked.

&quot;We&#39;d better find out,&quot; Minako sighed. They headed for the living 
room, where they found a very uncomfortable looking Usagi sitting on 
the couch, blushing furiously.

&#39;Whew, at least the VCR is off,&#39; Natsuna thought, feeling a bit 
relieved. &quot;What is that?&quot; she asked aloud.

&quot;They&#39;re in there,&quot; Usagi pointed to the next room. Minako thought 
that if Usagi blushed any harder, she&#39;d probably faint.

Minako opened the door, Natsuna looking over her shoulder, then just 
as quickly shut it. &quot;Luna and Artemis?&quot; she squeaked.

Natsuna had an odd look on her face as she slowly said, &quot;I guess Moon 
Kingdom cats can go into heat, too.&quot;

&quot;Could we go for a walk or something?&quot; Usagi asked faintly, even as 
they could hear the two cats starting up again.

&quot;Good idea,&quot; Minako, also a bit pale, agreed.

It was warm, the summer sun beating down on them. Natsuna looked over 
at Usagi and asked gently, &quot;Are you all right?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot; Usagi started to say.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know they would do that,&quot; Minako was blushing, &quot;so I don&#39;t 
see how you could have.&quot; She laughed softly, &quot;I wonder how long 
they&#39;ll be at it?&quot;

Natsuna shook her head, &quot;Well, if they&#39;re not done by the time we get 
back, I&#39;ll dump cold water on them.&quot;

Usagi had to smile at that mental image.

&quot;There&#39;s something I wanted to tell you,&quot; Minako smiled at her, &quot;about 
me and Natsuna.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lovers,&quot; Usagi shrugged. Both Minako and Natsuna stopped cold. 
Usagi looked at them, &quot;What? It&#39;s not that hard to tell.&quot;

Natsuna chuckled softly, and Minako made a mental note to try not to 
underestimate Usagi again. &quot;You&#39;re taking it well,&quot; Natsuna teased her 
gently.

&quot;And I was worried,&quot; Minako sighed.

&quot;You two look happy together,&quot; Usagi blushed, &quot;and that&#39;s the only 
important thing.&quot;

&#39;She really is wiser than she seems,&#39; Natsuna thought.

&quot;Have you two been to the Crown before?&quot; Usagi asked. She sighed, 
&quot;There&#39;s the cutest guy working there, Andrew.&quot;

&#39;On the other hand, she&#39;s still a teenager,&#39; Natsuna grinned. &quot;Let&#39;s 
go then,&quot; she laughed.

&quot;You scream, I scream, we all scream for ice cream,&quot; Minako and Usagi 
sang together.
