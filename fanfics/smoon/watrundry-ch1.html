<h1>Water Runs Dry (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/psychokitten.html">PsYcHoKiTtEnSeNsHi611</a><br> </h2>
<pre> How come who&#39;s asking? The stream, running full force, was a 
beautiful blue color.  Not deep blue or light blue, but a sort of 
mixture of the two.  Just a beautiful blue color.  They had never 
seen such a color before.
 The two lovers, both petite women, looked up from the stream 
and into each others eyes.  One had light pink colored hair, and 
the other had dark blue...almost a black.  They were both not 
wearing anything, as is customary in the fourth dimension.  The 
lover&#39;s bodies shone in the light, but they did not look over the 
other&#39;s form.  They just continued to look at each other, before 
looking back into the stream.
 &quot;It&#39;s so beautiful, Hotaru.&quot;  The pink haired one said, 
still looking at the stream.  &quot;I wish I could stay here with you 
forever.&quot;
 &quot;Why can&#39;t you?&quot;  The dark haired one said.  &quot;We both need 
each other, Chibi-chan.  We do.  So just stay here with me.&quot;
 &quot;I can&#39;t.  I just...can&#39;t.&quot;  Replied the pink haired girl.
 &quot;Look at our stream, Chibi.  Watch it flow.  This is our 
love.  Don&#39;t deny it!  It&#39;s our love, flowing, just as it always 
will.  We have always been a part of each other, and always will 
be.&quot;
 &quot;Our water WILL run dry, Hotaru.  It will run dry.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We don&#39;t even talk anymore
And we don&#39;t even know what we argue about
Don&#39;t even say I love you no more
Cause sayin&#39; how we feel is no longer allowed
Some people work things out
And some just don&#39;t know how to change
Let&#39;s don&#39;t wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let&#39;s don&#39;t wait till the water runs dry
We&#39;ll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don&#39;t do it baby
Now they can see the tears in our eyes
But we deny the pain that lies deep in our hearts
Well maybe that&#39;s a pain we can&#39;t hide
Cause everybody knows that we&#39;re both torn apart
Why do we hurt each other
Why do we push love away
Let&#39;s don&#39;t wait till the water runs dry
We might watch our whole lives pass us by
Let&#39;s don&#39;t wait till the water runs dry
We&#39;ll make the biggest mistake of our lives
Don&#39;t do it baby
--Boyz II Men

	Haruka sat next to Hotaru&#39;s bed, almost crying herself.  She 
understood her friend&#39;s pain almost perfectly.  She had just gotten over 
some troubles with Michiru, and the nagging pain was still at the back 
of her mind.
	Something inside of her told her Hotaru needed to be alone.  She 
stood up, trying to force out some kind of comforting words, but none 
came.  All she could manage was a comforting smile, and a hand on 
Hotaru&#39;s shoulder.
	Hotaru nodded to Haruka, then placed her head in her hands once 
again.  She knew this was it.  She knew it was finally over.
	ChibiUSA was gone.  Gone forever.  She had called Hotaru up to 
tell her it was over, and Hotaru didn&#39;t even hear one tone of sadness in 
her lover&#39;s voice.  Chibi had just told her she couldn&#39;t do it 
anymore...she couldn&#39;t keep living like this.
	Living like what?  Hotaru asked herself.  Living on different 
continents, only seeing each other on holidays?  She could understand 
that.  But...but...it was all so RIGHT, how could it just end like that?  
Two words and her entire life came crashing down.  ChibiUSA was the love 
of her life, and she could feel the love they shared even though they 
were miles apart.  She had decided to take the year study in the United 
States at Stanford.  An irreplaceable opportunity, she had said.
	Chibi was never one to pass up opportunities like this.
	She had practically begged Hotaru to join her, but Hotaru had 
declined.  Her own dreams were being fulfilled here in Japan, and she 
hadn&#39;t wanted to pass up her own opportunity to become a doctor.  She 
did it half out of the pain she was suffering from the loss, but the 
other half of her knew it was right.  She had thought that the 
separation would be just a test of their love, and everything would turn 
out right in a year just one year.  That&#39;s all.  Just one year.  Then 
they&#39;d be together again and everything would be just as it was before, 
and they would get married.  Just like they had planned.
	But it was all over.  The year was almost up, and ChibiUSA had 
called Hotaru like she had done every month.  But it was no longer the 
happy and excited and somewhat depressed Chibi.  It was a cold and 
foreign Chibi.  She just told Hotaru she would stay another year, and 
that she was ending their engagement.  She had just said that she 
couldn&#39;t go on anymore.
	Hotaru burst into tears at the thought.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Five thousand miles away, ChibiUSA sat in front of the phone, 
wondering what she had just done.  Hotaru had cried, she realized, and 
her eyes went wide with sadness at the thought.  What was she doing?  
She should be back home with her one true love sleeping in her arms.  
She should be in her bed, in her embrace, and in her life again.  What 
was she doing in this University in California, anyway?  Studying to 
become something she didn&#39;t even want.  She wanted to be a wife to 
Hotaru, and that was it.
	How could she, now that she had called it off?  She couldn&#39;t 
possibly call Hotaru right back and just say &quot;oops I&#39;m sorry about that!  
I was just kidding!&quot;  What was that supposed to be?  Stupid dreams.  Why 
did she listen to them?  That was what her father did, and he had almost 
ruined his relationship with her mother.  But, luckily, her father had 
caught himself.  How the hell was she supposed to catch herself?  Every 
time she thought about Hotaru the dreams would creep into her head and 
horrify her...seeing the black haired girl die at her feet.  She couldn&#39;t 
possibly risk her life.  She couldn&#39;t be that selfish.
Hotaru was sitting on her bed now, probably crying.  Chibi could 
picture it perfectly.  Hotaru&#39;s small body, curled up in a tiny ball, 
holding a battered piece of Klean-x, her blue-black hair falling limp in 
front of her deep blue eyes.
	&quot;Oh God...what have I done?!&quot;  Chibi hunched over the phone, tears 
pouring out of her and sobs wracking her small body like never before.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stream was beginning to trickle, no longer running with 
the same strength.  The dark haired girl gripped the other, pain 
in her eyes.  &quot;ChibiUSA, please, no!&quot;  She called out.  &quot;It 
can&#39;t...it just CAN&#39;T!&quot;
		&quot;It must, Hotaru.  It just has to happen.&quot;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Haruka-papa!  Come back here!&quot;  Hotaru laughed, trying to grab 
the anniversary present from Haruka&#39;s eager hands.  Michiru just 
laughed, placing another plate on the table for the party.  She watched 
as her God-daughter ran after her lover, and smiled slightly.  Haruka 
wasn&#39;t supposed to open any of the presents for their anniversary, but 
she had already gotten to a couple.  Matching rings with two stones cut 
to resemble the two planets they represented, necklaces with &quot;H&amp;M 
Forever&quot; on both, a couple paintings, and assorted nick-knacks to place 
around their new house.  Michiru smiled at that thought.  Their own 
house.  She couldn&#39;t wait.
	Haruka slowed down, breathless, still cradling the small silver-
wrapped package.  She breathed heavily, hunching over and placing her 
left hand on her knee, holding the package with her right.  She smiled a 
tired smile, and looked up at Hotaru.
	&quot;Give...it...back...&quot;  Hotaru said between gasps for air.
	&quot;Come on...let me just open it now!&quot;  Haruka gasped.  She looked up 
suddenly to see Michiru standing there, a hand on her aqua-colored 
dress.  Her hair tumbled down in front of her eyes, and her lips wore a 
smile.  She lifted up a small hand and held it out in front of her, 
motioning to the package.
	&quot;Haruka...&quot;  She softly pleaded, and Haruka obeyed her silent 
question.  Handing over the package with a scowl, she stood up straight.  
&quot;Thank you, Haruka.&quot;  Michiru said quietly, and walked over to her 
lover.  She wrapped an arm around Haruka&#39;s waist and kissed her 
fiercely, forgetting about Hotaru completely.
	&quot;You two!&quot;  Hotaru knew when to turn around.  She turned on her 
heels and walked outside, leaving the two alone.  She knew that if she 
and Chibi were kissing...
	She suddenly stopped the thought.  She and Chibi were no...longer...
	Hotaru sat down on the bench in the garden, placing her head in 
her hands.  Not again.  She didn&#39;t want to have to go through this every 
day of her life.  She didn&#39;t want to have to keep telling herself OVER 
and OVER that it was done.
	She looked up at the noise of a car approaching.  She wondered who 
it could be.  Guests were not arriving for another hour or so.  Setsuna 
was out shopping for some goodies...hopefully bringing something back for 
her.  So who could it be?
	She looked down at her feet again, and ran her hands through her 
wavy tendrils of hair.  She was stressed, high strung, wound up like a 
spring.  She didn&#39;t WANT to be, but knew she was.  She needed to see 
ChibiUSA again, just once, to know it was really over.  She needed to 
see her again and talk to her and touch her pink hair and look into her 
red eyes, just ONE MORE TIME.  Just one.
	A car door opened and slammed shut.  She didn&#39;t even look up.  She 
didn&#39;t really want to.  She just ran her hands through her hair again, 
and closed her eyes tight to try to remember every single detail about 
her only love&#39;s face.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	ChibiUSA got out of the car, all the while her eyes on the timid 
figure sitting on a bench.  She knew who it was.
	She forced her eyes away to look up at the house.  It was 
gorgeous, really.  She hadn&#39;t expected it to be so big.  The entire 
house was a beige color, and the garden was big and gorgeous.  Flowers 
reached up to her thighs, but were all trimmed and well taken care of.  
The bench that her former lover was sitting on was lined by a small 
pathway that entwined in the flowers, half hiding her in the beautiful 
growth.  It seemed fitting that a beautiful flower should be surrounded 
by beautiful flowers.
	No, her inner voice shouted at her.  You ended that relationship, 
and you have to accept responsibility.
	Apologize!  Another voice screamed at her.  Apologize and 
everything will be fine again she&#39;ll take you back because you love each 
other and...
	But what if she doesn&#39;t love you anymore?  What if she&#39;s found 
someone else?
	Chibi almost cried out with the unbearable thought.  What if she 
HAS found someone else?  Someone who loves her more and cares for her 
more and kisses her and holds her...no one can touch her.  ChibiUSA knew 
she would have to do it soon, have to explain herself and apologize 
before the day was up.  She couldn&#39;t let the horrible pain go on another 
second.
	She walked briskly into the garden, trying to dodge plants as best 
she could.  She couldn&#39;t find a good enough path, so she began to 
carefully weave her way through the growth.  She tried, in vain, to 
brush off some of the petals and pollen that stuck to her dark jean 
shorts as she did so.
	She found herself a few feet away from the bench, with Hotaru&#39;s 
head still down.  Hotaru looked stressed, pained...not loved.  She hoped, 
with a selfish thought, that she hadn&#39;t been loved lately.  At least, 
not the way ChibiUSA would love her.  Not like that.  Hotaru&#39;s arms were 
on either side of her head, and Chibi could sense that she was deep in 
thought.  What was she thinking?  She couldn&#39;t tell.  She didn&#39;t know if 
she wanted to be able to tell.
	&quot;Hotaru.&quot;  She whispered, slightly quivering on the &#39;u&#39;.  Hotaru 
whipped her head upwards at the sound, and her eyes took Chibi in.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Her hair had grown slightly, and she seemed to be a little taller.  
Her dark jean shorts looked really good with the pink T-shirt, and her 
little pink flip-flops were just right for the warm summer weather.  Her 
eyes were still the beautiful shade of red, and her lips were the same 
color.
	An overwhelming heat seeped through Hotaru&#39;s blood as her gaze 
focused on her once-lover&#39;s lips.  Oh God, she thought.  I must be 
imagining her.  That&#39;s it...I&#39;m just imagining.  She&#39;s not really here, 
she didn&#39;t come to the party, she is still back at her college.
	&quot;Hotaru?&quot;  Chibi said again, this time questioning her.
	Hotaru cleared her throat, trying to prepare herself for the pain 
that was about to come.  &quot;Hello, ChibiUSA.  Nice to see you.&quot;  Her voice 
came out remarkably controlled, the pain masked by the cold tone.  Her 
eyes and heart hardened, like ice.  She didn&#39;t want to feel the pain 
anymore.  She returned to her darkened self, inside herself and 
retreating back away.
	ChibiUSA looked shocked.  She had never seen Hotaru so cold 
before...Hotaru was always the voice of calm among the two, the reason in 
their chaos.  But never, ever, had ChibiUSA seem her so cold.
	&quot;I didn&#39;t think you would come back here so soon.&quot;  Hotaru said, 
trying to mask the uncomfortable silence.  Her eyes narrowed into small 
slits, and her lips thinned out.  She realized just how ANGRY she was at 
Chibi, and clenched her fists at the thought.  How DARE she come back 
here, how dare she just stand there and act like everything is fine.  
She must have a lot of guts coming back here...
	&quot;Of course, Hotaru!  It&#39;s Michiru&#39;s and Haruka&#39;s anniversary...and 
besides, it&#39;s summer vacation.  I wouldn&#39;t miss seeing all the Senshi 
back in one place for anything!&quot;  She put on a silly grin, showing her 
perfectly straight white teeth.  Hotaru almost joined in with a smile of 
her own, but she caught herself.
	Hotaru stood up with the pure awkwardness of it all, and placed 
her hand on her hip.  &quot;Well I must be going now.  Setsuna-mama is at the 
mall, and I have to go meet her.  See you later.&quot;  Hotaru walked briskly 
away, and Chibi stood still as she walked by.  Her eyes swept over 
Hotaru&#39;s curves longingly, and she let out a sigh.  Hotaru caught it, 
but didn&#39;t say anything at all.  She didn&#39;t want to say anything.
	Hotaru was almost to her car when Chibi finally got control of 
herself.  &quot;Taru-chan!&quot;  She called, and ran toward her.  Hotaru didn&#39;t 
move, her hand extended with keys in hand to unlock the car door.  
&quot;Wait, Taru-chan!&quot;  She complied, and soon enough ChibiUSA had caught up 
with her.  She was a little out of breath, and Hotaru waited in a 
patient silence.  Chibi finally got control over herself, and stood up 
straight.  &quot;I&#39;ll go with you.&quot;
	&quot;That&#39;s fine.  You stay here.  I&#39;m sure everyone will want to see 
you.&quot;  Hotaru put the keys in the lock and turned them.
	&quot;I...I&#39;d like to go with you.  You know, catch up?&quot;  She let out a 
nervous smile.
	Hotaru couldn&#39;t resist.  She just couldn&#39;t.  &quot;You don&#39;t need to 
catch up with someone you pushed away,&quot; she snapped.
	Chibi was silent for a moment, and watched as Hotaru put her purse 
in the car.  Hotaru was walking around the side of the car when she 
caught herself in the daze again.  &quot;Hotaru...&quot;  She walked after her, and 
grabbed her arm gently.  &quot;I...I didn&#39;t want to push you away.  It&#39;s just...&quot;
	&quot;Just what, Chibi-chan?&quot;  She said curtly, tears forming at the 
base of her eyes.  &quot;Just someone else?  You found someone better in 
America, didn&#39;t you?&quot;  The tears fell like tiny stars to the ground.
	&quot;NO!&quot;  ChibiUSA said, her own tears forming.  &quot;I&#39;ve only ever 
loved you.  I still love you!  I always will!  I just have these dreams 
and you&#39;re...you&#39;re...&quot;
	Hotaru threw open her door and climbed in.  She quickly put the 
keys in the ignition and turned them, starting the car.  ChibiUSA ran 
around to the other side and climbed in quickly, surprising Hotaru.  She 
took her eyes from the steering wheel and looked at Chibi, shocked.  
&quot;Dreams, Chibi-chan?  DREAMS?  That&#39;s why you dumped me?&quot;
	&quot;Remember my father, when he had those problems with dreams?&quot;
	&quot;I remember you telling me about it, yes.&quot;
	&quot;The same kind of dreams, Taru-chan.  The same kinds of dreams.  
It scares me!  I couldn&#39;t possibly risk letting them come true!&quot;
	Hotaru put the car in reverse and drove away from the house, a 
little confused.  &quot;I don&#39;t understand, Chibi-chan.  I just don&#39;t.&quot;
	&quot;I love you, Taru-chan.  If that means sparing your life and 
getting rid of my happiness, then I&#39;ll do it!&quot;
	&quot;What about MY happiness?&quot;  Hotaru shouted.  &quot;I love you more than 
anything!  Without you I feel like I don&#39;t have a reason for living!&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t want it to be MY fault that you die!&quot;  ChibiUSA shouted 
back, tears streaming down her cheeks.  The mall loomed up ahead, and 
she wiped the tears away.  &quot;I couldn&#39;t stand the thought of putting you 
in danger.  I...I still can&#39;t.&quot;
	Hotaru pulled into the mall&#39;s parking lot, trying to keep her 
emotions under control.  &quot;Is the danger you felt gone now?&quot;  She 
whispered.
	&quot;No.&quot;  Their gazes met at the sound of the word.  Hotaru swallowed 
hard.
	&quot;Then...then why did you come here?&quot;
	&quot;Because I had to see you.  I had to know that you were alright.&quot;  
ChibiUSA closed her eyes and sighed.  She had finally gotten it all out, 
thank God.  Now Hotaru would know, and she could feel at least somewhat 
at peace.
	Hotaru swallowed hard again, trying to hold back the feelings of 
love and fear and overwhelming emotion that were beginning to overtake 
her.  &quot;I guess I understand.  But we can&#39;t be together if it&#39;s too 
dangerous, can we?&quot;
	&quot;I guess not.&quot;  ChibiUSA sighed.  &quot;But I still love you, Hotaru.  
I always will.&quot;
	&quot;I...I love you too, ChibiUSA.&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	&quot;Oh Hotaru!&quot;  The pink-haired girl flung herself into her 
lover&#39;s arms.  &quot;I want to be with you so much!&quot;
&quot;Why can&#39;t you?!  I don&#39;t understand!&quot;  The dark-haired girl 
said.  &quot;We love each other...&quot;  The stream was beginning to run 
again, and she smiled.  &quot;It&#39;s too obvious that we do.  Our stream 
is still running!&quot;
	&quot;It will always run.&quot;  The pink-haired girl smiled, but the 
smile quickly turned back into a worried frown.  &quot;But we can&#39;t 
always be together, Hotaru.&quot;
	&quot;I don&#39;t understand!&quot;  The other girl shouted once again.  
	&quot;Those who do not understand love will always get in the 
way.  It&#39;s too dangerous.  Our stream will continue to always run, 
believe me.  I won&#39;t let it run dry.&quot;
	&quot;It will run dry, Chibi-chan.  All things must.  You said it 
yourself.  If you don&#39;t want it to run dry, love me!  Just love 
me!&quot;  The dark-haired girl dropped to her knees.
	&quot;I will always love you, Hotaru.&quot;  The pink-haired girl 
said, and dropped to her knees in front of the other.  &quot;I will 
always love you.
