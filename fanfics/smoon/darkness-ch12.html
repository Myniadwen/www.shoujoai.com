<h1>Darkness (part 12 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Rei shifted in her sleep as she slowly opened her eyes. She looked 
around and noticed that she was in her bedroom. She looked down and 
saw Serena with her head laying on her chest. Rei smiled and ran her 
fingers through her hair.

She used her other hand that was around Serena&#39;s waist, and used it to 
run it up and down Serena&#39;s back soothingly. Serena slightly groaned 
and opened up her eyes. She looked up at Rei who was staring at her 
and with smile. Rei than used a hand to caress Serena&#39;s cheek lovingly 
and kissed Serena on the forehead.

Serena smiled a tired smile and moved up and kissed Rei on the lips. 
Serena sat up and straddled Rei&#39;s waist and looked around the room. 
She looked at the alarm clock that was on a desk which separated Amy&#39;s 
bed from Rei&#39;s and Serena&#39;s.

The little black clock read 7:30 pm and Serena looked back at Rei. 
Serena bent down and kissed Rei Longley on the lips. Before they broke 
for air, Serena slightly nibbled on Rei&#39;s bottom lip. When Serena 
finally rose for air, her and Rei&#39;s eyes turned green as Serena 
slightly smirked.

&quot;What are smirking at?&quot;, questioned Rei. Serena smirk turned into a 
genuine smile as she thought over her idea.

&quot;Why don&#39;t we ask if we can go out for a hunt together.&quot;, said Serena. 
Rei held a thoughtful look on her face as she thought over the idea 
herself.

&quot;Alright. Come on let&#39;s go ask.&quot;, said Rei. Serena bent down again and 
kissed Rei&#39;s neck before she slightly sucked and nipped along it. Rei 
giggled and patted Serena on her bottom.

&quot;Come on Serena!&quot;, laughed Rei as Serena continued her onslaught. 
Serena sighed slightly before she got off of Rei and stepped on the 
floor. She turned around and held out a hand for Rei. Rei took the 
hand and laced their fingers as Serena pulled her off of the bed.

&quot;What do you think Amara-papa and Michelle-mama going to say about 
this?&quot;, questioned Rei. Serena slightly groaned. She really hadn&#39;t 
thought about Michelle and Amara&#39;s reactions.

&quot;Well if I know Michelle-mama well enough, she&#39;ll be happy for us. And 
for Amara-papa that&#39;s a whole different story.&quot;, said Serena. Rei 
smirked as she thought over the possible things Amara would say to 
them.

&quot;Well Amara-papa would be happy for us, but she won&#39;t let this 
opportunity slide by a chance. She&#39;s probably going to tease us for 
all eternity.&quot;, remarked Rei. Serena smiled and caressed Rei&#39;s hand 
with her thumb.

She let go of Rei&#39;s hand and wrapped her arm around Rei&#39; waist. Rei 
slightly leaned over and wrapped an arm around Serena&#39;s shoulders. The 
two lovers walked out of the room and towards the kitchen. The girls 
jumped when they felt a hand land on their shoulders.

The two girls whipped around to be faced with Setsuna. Setsuna smiled 
down at the girls as she looked down at them warmly.

&quot;Oh hi Setsuna.&quot;, said Serena as she and Rei dropped their arms to 
their sides. Setsuna saw the movement and smiled even more.

&quot;You know, you don&#39;t have to hide your love for each other away from 
me.&quot;, replied Setsuna as she dropped her own hands and walked down the 
hallway.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;, exclaimed Rei trying to hold back her 
blush, but failing miserably. Setsuna smirked as she looked over to 
the girls. The girls shifted uncomfortably at the look, it made 
Setsuna look... well plain scary.

&quot;I know you two are lovers, and soon will Hotaru and Rini. I can feel 
your passion for each other a mile away.&quot;, said Setsuna as she 
continued her way down the hall. Rei and Serena looked at each other 
for a moment and than turned back to Setsuna who was gone.

&quot;She&#39;s scary.&quot;, whispered Rei and Serena nodded her head in agreement. 
The two girls jumped when they heard Setsuna&#39;s laughter echoing down 
the halls.

&quot;Really scary.&quot;, remarked Serena as the two girls took off down the 
hallway. When they reached the kitchen and looked around in slight 
confusion.

Amara sat at the kitchen table pouting and holding both of her hands 
behind her head as Michelle glared at her. Hotaru had her arms crossed 
over her chest as she too glared at Amara. Rini sat at the table with 
both of her hands covering her red face.

They both also noticed two new faces at the table. Rei and Serena 
screamed and whipped their heads around. Setsuna stood behind them and 
she laughed slightly.

&#39;How did she get behind us?&#39; thought Rei and Serena with wide eyes. 
Setsuna passed through the two girls and walked into the kitchen. Rei 
and Serena followed behind her and sat down at the table.

&quot;So who are you two?&quot;, questioned Rei. Molly and Melvin looked at each 
other before replying.

&quot;Molly and Melvin, you?&quot;, They both asked.

&quot;My name is Rei and that&#39;s Serena.&quot;, she replied. Serena turned to 
Hotaru and Rini.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you two?&quot;, asked Serena. Hotaru shifted her gaze to 
Serena.

&quot;Amara-papa said that Rini and I like each other and that we are going 
out!&quot;, exclaimed Hotaru as she slightly glared at her papa. Amara 
pouted slightly and stuck out her tongue towards the nine year old. 
With that gesture, Amara was rewarded with another pop to the head.

&quot;Amara! Act your age and not your shoe size!&quot;, scolded Michelle. Amara 
slouched down in her chair as her face turned a pinkish color from 
embarrassment. Serena laughed as Rei continued to converse with Molly 
and Melvin.

&quot;Um, Amara-papa and Michelle-mama?&quot;, replied Serena. Amara and 
Michelle looked towards their daughter.

&quot;Yeah, what is it?&quot;, asked Michelle.

&quot;Well I was wondering if Rei and I could go out on a hunt?&quot;, asked 
Serena. Everything quieted down as everyone&#39;s attention turned towards 
the conversation.

&quot;No&quot;

&quot;Yes&quot;

Amara and Michelle looked at each other.

&quot;Why can&#39;t they go Michelle?&quot;, said Amara. Michelle sighed as she 
looked over towards her lover.

&quot;There are to many dangers out there. We were just attacked by 
Slayers. We don&#39;t need them hurt, or even worse killed&quot;, replied 
Michelle.

&quot;But Michelle-mama, we&#39;ll be careful. Plus Serena and I will be with 
each other the whole time.&quot;, said Rei.

&quot;Yeah, and if we get into any trouble we&#39;ll come straight back.&quot;, 
exclaimed Serena. Michelle sighed as the two girls gave them the look. 
With their eyes wide and the tears welling up in them and their little 
pouty lips. Michelle was so weak against that look, especially Amara.

&quot;Fine fine, you can go.&quot;, said Michelle. Serena and Rei jumped into 
the air excitedly and started saying how Michelle was the best.

&quot;But.... if your not back in an hour, Amara and I will come and get 
you.&quot;, said Michelle firmly. Rei and Serena nodded their heads and 
bounced off towards their room.</pre>
