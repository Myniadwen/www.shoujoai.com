<h1>Under the Pale of a Vanishing Moon (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/alithea.html">Alithea</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/underpale-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Setsuna sat on the toppled obsidian monument with her eyes closed as her 
thoughts drifted into the past. She wandered as far back a she could 
dare remember without losing herself. She had purposely arrived at least 
five minutes before Beryl in order to make peace with her surroundings 
before flying into battle. It had been thousands of years since she had 
last been in that place.

The planet was desolate now, void of life save the remainders of the old 
civilization. Except for the Earth all the planets looked like that. All 
were in ruins under the weight of the battle with the Dark Kingdom and 
then finally with the vanishing of the gods. In all respects the gods 
never really vanished, and they did not actually die. They had merely 
fallen into the slumber of disbelief. She knew that one day in the 
future, so far-flung she could barely see it, the gods would once again 
wake and the solar system would be in a state of bliss as it had during 
the time of the Moon Kingdom. But that future, that piece of destiny was 
lost to the present situation. One misstep, one wrong turn towards a 
balcony ensured that the old gods would never again wake to their former 
glory.

She tried not to let the thought cause her sorrow. She would put things 
right. She would do her duty.

Her eyes opened, soft and languid pools of maroon so deep they begged to 
be drunk in like the richest of wines. She looked up into the face of 
the giant statues that stood behind her, cracked and ripe with 
devastation and she whispered something that could have been a prayer. 
It spoke of duty, and it spoke of how it had always been inherent to her 
destiny.

&quot;Destiny and duty,&quot; she said to one statue in particular, &quot;Those things 
you never had any trouble with. Of all your kin you were always the only 
one who fully understood it. Even she in all her trying and loving you 
could not fully accept it sometimes could she... father, Lord Hades?&quot;

Of all her beginnings she regarded being born on Pluto as one of her 
very first. There were others, distant and barely caught in the veil of 
recollection, and they reached beyond the beginning of the gods. But 
Pluto and the people she had encountered there she regarded as very 
special to her. The Time she was allowed there stuck in her memories 
like no other place could, except perhaps the Moon and the Earth. She 
had been the daughter of the god of the under world and the goddess of 
the seasons. Death and the turning of the seasons, which was practically 
the turning of Time, those were the things she carried in her blood. And 
her blood remembered those things so well she felt as if perhaps she had 
always been made of them. Whatever the case Pluto had a been a place she 
once called home, and while there were moments she had looked into Hades 
eyes and found that he could only see her as Time&#39;s child, she knew deep 
within his heart that he hoped desperately she would be granted a 
different destiny. She knew he had loved her as his precious little 
girl.

She felt a pang of guilt at not regarding her parents on Earth so 
dearly. It was harder to do though because they had not lived very long 
after her birth.

She stood from where she was sitting. Beryl would be coming very soon.

Setsuna turned to face the statues and said, &quot;Beginnings and endings... 
I&#39;ve been given many, but it was here I think...that I learned to 
appreciate each one I that was given.&quot;

&quot;That was beautiful, Setsuna. Really, I think I could almost cry,&quot; a 
snide female voice edged in from behind.

She turned quickly eyes narrowed, &quot;You may not address me by that name.&quot;

Beryl grinned, &quot;Oh but what is in a name? I wouldn&#39;t think it should 
matter to you. After all you have titles to spare.&quot;

Sailor Pluto gritted her teeth and then instantly shut her eyes to try 
and control her feelings.

&quot;If you hold your anger in it will only make it worse when you do 
finally lose control,&quot; the red head beamed. &quot;I congratulate you on 
beating me here by the way.&quot;

&quot;It was not hard to figure out. You have a nasty reputation for playing 
on others emotions.&quot;

&quot;A talent that developed after years of having mine played.&quot;

Pluto moved into a guarded stance and smirked as she said, &quot;It&#39;s funny 
you should mention that because I wanted to ask you, just once... Was it 
really because you loved him? Is all of this because you could not have 
him?&quot;

It tastes so bitter
The words I can not hear
The things you will never say to me
I want your sweetness
I need that kindness
But it all strips away into darkness
It all washes under the current
That this feeling leaves coating my throat
It tastes so bitter and I thought you were sweet
It tastes so vile and I wanted you sweet
The taste changes my feelings and they are hard to swallow
This soured thing...
This black pit
But I wanted it so...
So sweet

Beryl frowned briefly and then grinned as she brought her hand up. Five 
crystals floated around her palm and then moved into the air multiplying 
as they went. The crystals hovered in waiting for her next command. The 
Senshi eyed them and then focused back onto her opponent

&quot;You bring him up as if he was my only defining factor,&quot; the dark queen 
said almost laughing, half insulted. Ruby red eyes narrowed and she 
grinned, her fangs practically bit into her lower lip. She shook her 
head and then said, &quot;We haven&#39;t the time for playfully banter as I would 
like, but no...No he was not my all consuming reason. I mentioned before 
having my emotions played. Metalia picked up on my feelings for him. 
They were much, much easier for her to understand in her state and I 
think anyone would jump to that conclusion considering the way I went 
about things with the little brat. But then why would anyone else 
consider my other reasons? Why would anyone be able to tap into 
something so guarded as my true feelings?&quot;

Beryl did not wait for a response and closed her still open hand into a 
tight fist. The crystals in the air rained down at a momentous speed 
stabbing into anything they happened to touch. Pluto managed to deflect 
a number of them with her staff but for the most part did what she could 
to dodge the onslaught.

Next, Setsuna thought, next she will start to raise the rubble to throw 
at me...but that would be a serious mistake considering where we are.

As she thought the ground beneath her feet began to shake and large 
portions of the land began to rise into the air. Her foe was calm and 
patiently waiting.

&quot;I know, you think I&#39;m foolish for fighting you here,&quot; Beryl said 
calmly. &quot;But why haven&#39;t you used that attack of yours yet? I thought 
you wanted to provide me with some justice, but you&#39;re purposely letting 
me toy with you. It&#39;s utterly hopeless you know. You&#39;ve seen what 
happens.&quot;

Hunks of rock and dirt began their sudden and vicious attack towards the 
spot where Pluto had been waiting. She seized the moment and jumped up 
onto a giant slab, barely dodging another barrage of crystals as she 
used her staff to vault herself closer to the sinister woman. She landed 
on the toppled statue of Hades and spun her staff to deflect more 
crystals. She shut her eyes and collected her power.

&quot;Dead scream,&quot; Sailor Pluto whispered in a very controlled and nearly 
inaudible tone.

The pieces of the land that Beryl controlled began to turn on her, but 
she merely smirked and held them back, almost without effort.

They stood locked in battle for a few moments more and then Pluto closed 
her eyes and vanished. Beryl&#39;s attack flung itself at the spot where the 
elegant warrior was in an avalanche of rock and dirt. The evil ruler of 
the dark kingdom laughed victoriously, suddenly stopped short as her 
breath was squeezed by the powerful feel of Pluto&#39;s staff at her throat.

&quot;How-&quot; Beryl tried to speak but the grasp she was in was too strong.

&quot;You have really insulted me by daring to enter my domain and destroy 
me. You are over confident in your powers over earth,&quot; Setsuna whispered 
sharply into the villain&#39;s ear. &quot;I should banish you into the far 
reaches of Time and have you vainly attempt the walk back to where you 
belong. I should strangle the life out of you for the injury your little 
tryst has caused to me.&quot;

The grip about her neck loosened and the red head replied, &quot;But you 
won&#39;t will you. You can&#39;t. You are bound-&quot;

The strangle hold tightened up again and the woman gasped.

Deep merlot colored eyes darkened and the sound of the Senshi&#39;s voice 
grew to something heavy, &quot;I am bound by my duty, not that you understand 
what that means. You should count yourself lucky that I am not quick to 
anger. You should feel blessed that I understand my place in the 
Universe, because the revenge I could inflict upon you for your actions 
towards the Moon Kingdom alone would be enough to make even the gods 
weep.&quot;

&quot;Will you? Will you do it Setsuna?&quot; The tone was all loss and pleading. 
It was thick with the sound of someone who had spent a lifetime doing 
nothing but wrong and finally wished for retribution.

&quot;What?&quot; her grip loosened.

She had to move to look into the ruby red eyes of her foe, eyes whose 
brightness were dulling to the color of blood, and were stung with 
regret. Eyes that were so sad and lost in darkness that even she, the 
Guardian of Time, could not help but feel great pity. That kind of 
loneliness was something she could feel deeply. It was something that 
stung at her from the echoes of Time. It prodded at her past, in those 
years before she became Time&#39;s Guardian again.

Before she could do anything further Pluto called the delinquent key 
into her hands. She placed it around her neck and then struck her staff 
into ground as a void of darkness rose up and wrapped up around both 
women.

Under the hush of this silent flight
I seek only the truth tonight
I want to fall under your rage
I need to know your vengeance will catch me in its cage
I have lingered on the thought of this moment
This pull into our greater fates
I swallow all the bitter edges
The sharp cuts of your rejection
All the hate you carry with you
Under the harsh sting of this anger
I wait for the silence that will come
The endless sound of your tears upon my face
The patter of rain on a grave no one would dare mourn
I have lost you
I always lose you
To fate
To destiny
To time
To a love you could never see passed
You could never see me
But I have one thing
I&#39;ve this tiny chance
It is what Time can offer
It is but a passing glance
And the promise bittersweet
That once again we should meet

They stood in complete darkness; or rather the place where they stood 
was void of color. There was no light and yet they could clearly see 
each other. Sailor Pluto was at ease in the space, but Beryl looked 
around bewildered by the surroundings.

&quot;Where are we?&quot;

&quot;We are in the space between Time. It is a section of nothing between 
Time. It is a place of creation where the next moment folds into 
existence.&quot;

&quot;And where-&quot;

&quot;This empty space occurs the second before Sailor Moon destroys both you 
and Metalia.&quot;

The red head seemed to resist what would have been her natural reaction 
of pure anger at defeat. She shrunk in her place.

Pluto arched an eyebrow and sighed. She pushed away her staff until it 
vanished so she could cross her arms over her chest.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how you managed it and frankly I do not care to know. The 
fact that you could squeeze out of Metalia&#39;s grasp to avoid destruction 
is highly impressive, especially considering that you had combined 
yourself into her. But that you would dare attempt to tamper with things 
in Time can not be forgiven. You could have just escaped and found 
another life for yourself.&quot;

&quot;The only life I wanted was the one I could not have, Setsuna,&quot; Beryl 
returned softly understanding her defeat.

&quot;Why do you insist upon calling me that?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s your name, and it suits you best. It always did. There was a time 
you did not mind hearing it from me.&quot;

Her voice and her eyes pleaded for the recognition and the Senshi could 
do nothing but concede, &quot;You destroyed any right you ever had to that 
name. You decided to walk a path of destruction and use you gift, all 
that wonderful power... you squandered it. Your jealousy blinded you and 
kept you from seeing all the other people and things that could love you 
the way you wanted.&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t want their love!&quot; Hot rage built up inside her visible in her 
eyes, the tension of her muscles and then dying as her despair and 
defeat took her over again, &quot;I wanted you... &quot;

She could not cry. She dared not cry. She wanted so badly to cry. To 
take the broken woman up in her arms and say she was sorry that fate 
should be so cruel but she could not. Just like Beryl everything Setsuna 
felt was buried in the color of her eyes. And she was sorry, she felt 
guilty but anything she felt could not undo what had been. It would not 
change the way things would end, and it would certainly not stop Beryl 
from turning to the call of evil. All those choices, all those roads 
could only be walked and arranged by the woman herself. There was hardly 
anything she could say but she found a few.

&quot;Your sins are great and your crimes are many, but do not think that you 
can pass the blame for your choices on something so trite. Even I...even 
after everything that has occurred... Do you know what I could have done 
after the Dark Kingdom managed to destroy everything I loved?&quot;

Beryl nodded, &quot;I divined it once. It was curious to see you so engulfed 
with darkness. I&#39;d never seen you look so beautiful. But you chose 
differently, it&#39;s the flaw with divination you know? You can never be 
sure which way someone will really go, but you can hope.&quot;

&quot;I gave you...everything I could at the...the Time.&quot;

&quot;Did you? It just wasn&#39;t in the cards is that right? You wanted to love 
me but could not? Duty over pleasure is that the thing? But no, it 
wasn&#39;t any of that was it? You simply could not love me. It was all 
young girls&#39; foolish dreams. You may not be fully responsible for my 
actions but you helped to plant the seed of my darkness.&quot;

&quot;I told you all the reasons already Beryl. I gave them to you as gently 
as I could, and I thought you had understood.&quot;

&quot;I understood only that it hurt. I could have almost swallowed the 
bitterness of losing you, only to have end up loving Serenity. I could 
almost understand that. But then her daughter stole his affections and 
that was just too much to abide with. So I decided no one would be 
happy. I knew what would happen when I let Metalia control me. I knew 
how she would play on my feelings. But I also knew you, and I hoped to 
die by your hands back then. I hope for it still.&quot;

Sailor Pluto shook her head and walked over to the woman, placing a hand 
on her shoulder. A burst of light began to form around them as she 
whispered, &quot;You don&#39;t deserve it.&quot;

The light was blinding, radiating across the artic sky. Metalia 
screeched as her victory was crushed by the power of the Silver Crystal. 
Deep within her Beryl looked down upon the brat of a princess and wept. 
She did not even bother to try and offer more help as Metalia screamed 
for her to do so.

&quot;All our power is gone,&quot; she said amid the dominance that irradiated 
over her, quickly destroying her and freeing her soul. &quot;And like the 
crystal foretold... our jealousy has destroyed us.&quot;

Under the pale of the moon
I once knew a beautiful woman
Who gave me all she could
She gave me pleasures but she couldn&#39;t give me love
Her heart was supped up by another
Her fate tied to the Moon
Under the rock of a steady breeze
I once knew a powerful woman
Who gave me all she could
She gave me kisses deep as the night
But she couldn&#39;t give me love
She couldn&#39;t give me love
So I gave her vengeance
I gave her a little of my broken heart
And her agony is my happiness
And her sorrow is my joy
And her hatred of me is her love
Yes I knew a woman
But she just didn&#39;t know me

She stood at the Center of Time and watched the image.

Two young women kissed fervently beneath a large tree as the sun set in 
the distance and the moon began to rise. The weather was clear and warm 
and not another soul was near them. They broke the kiss and then sat 
with each other amid the tall green grass. One was slightly taller than 
the other with a paler pallor, red hair and eyes the color rubies, and 
the other had a darker olive complexion, evergreen hair that stretched 
to her back and eyes like the deepest cup of wine. They watched the last 
of the color bleed from the sky as the darker blue blacks over took it. 
The stars came out and they fell into each others arms.

&quot;Do you think it will always be like this, even when I&#39;m queen,&quot; the red 
head asked.

&quot;I think we are better off appreciating the Time we have been given,&quot; 
her companion replied solemnly.

&quot;You have your father&#39;s out look on life.&quot;

&quot;No, I have his understanding of it.&quot;

The red head was going to say something more but she was stopped by a 
finger to her lips.

&quot;Don&#39;t ruin the moment with what the future could bring,&quot; the young 
woman with the maroon eyes said hurriedly.

And then they fell back into the pull of young lust, and the hint of 
what could have been a great love.

The image faded and Pluto was met with eyes of the same color looking 
back at her, another self that she had not seen for ages. She sighed and 
shook her head but the other self spoke before she could even think of a 
decent question to ask.

&quot;I told you it would not be easy for you. That is why I gave you the 
choice.&quot;

Pluto looked across at the older version of her self and tried not to 
sound angry, &quot;You offered me a choice when there was none to make. How 
could you think I would ever refuse?&quot;

&quot;I did not think you would, I wanted to at least let you know that it 
would not be easy. But however hard it was going to be for you I also 
knew that you would have a chance for something that I never would.&quot;

&quot;What exactly would I have?&quot;

&quot;Love.&quot;

She quirked an eyebrow and whispered dryly, &quot;Yes lucky me.&quot;

&quot;You can look and see how things would have been if you had said no.&quot;

&quot;I have, thank you. Even then she does not choose the right path. We 
still end up enemies and I think over all it&#39;s just as big of a mess as 
it is now.&quot;

&quot;Put aside Beryl for moment and consider the one you really love.&quot;

She shut her eyes and bit at her bottom lip. &quot;Anyway I look at it I&#39;m 
partially responsible for ruining her life. I break her heart and she 
never recovers.&quot;

&quot;It is not like you to brood like this. You said it yourself there were 
other options open to her. She chose her own path and you my dear did 
the same. You decided on duty and great responsibility... and because of 
it you were greatly rewarded.&quot;

&quot;What did you choose?&quot;

&quot;I chose destruction. It was a terrible mistake but it was mine to 
make.&quot;

Pluto sighed, &quot;We seem to make those big mistakes every two thousand 
years or so.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s change. As Time does so must we and for the better I would say. 
You must cherish everything you have been given...even the things you 
wish you could undo. There are always worse things you could have done.&quot;

The other version of her self faded and she was left alone at the 
center. She took a moment and then straightened herself. She looked into 
the center and said, &quot;Show me what happens if I take the key Beryl found 
and place on the key ring so that it never falls off.&quot;

She watched the play of images, her expression void of emotion.

&quot;And if I take it from her when Sailor Moon defeats Metalia?&quot;

A new set of images played through and she shut her eyes sadly. She 
nearly walked away and then a thought came to her head.

&quot;What if,&quot; she asked solidly, &quot;I take the key and move it some place 
else so that Beryl does not find it?&quot;

The images sprang forth and her exact reaction was hard to read.

&quot;I suppose my course of action is clear then,&quot; she whispered and walked 
off deep into the swirl of Time.</pre>
