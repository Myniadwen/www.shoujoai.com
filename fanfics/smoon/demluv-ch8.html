<h1>Of Demons and Love (part 8 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/byakko.html">Byakko Rei</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/demluv-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>DR. WAKAI

  Usagi arrived at the office check in window 
promptly at 4:30. She put her backpack on a coat 
hook on the wall, and took her guitar in with 
her like a security blanket.
  She was directed to a small room, instructed 
to remove her clothes, and put a smock on so 
that it opened in the front. 
  *Sigh* 
  Usagi perched on the edge of the paper-covered 
vinyl examination table with stirrups, and swung 
her feet. After she perused all the wall 
materials a few times, she had memorized how to 
do her breast examinations... maybe it would be 
more fun with Rei. 
  She knew by heart what her baby would look 
like and how much it would weigh during each 
gestational week. She was suddenly glad Rei 
wasn&#39;t there to see all of the pictures with 
happy couples and their newborns, thank you 
notes attached. Or see all the birth control 
methods available. There wasn&#39;t anything there 
to help couples who couldn&#39;t have children and 
wanted them. 
  Usagi understood the government&#39;s position, 
but she didn&#39;t have to like it. 
  There was a single sheet of paper which listed 
adoption agencies. She saw the one Mamoru had 
grown up in, and felt a pang of remorse. The 
world seemed to be full of people who have been 
dealt a crumby lot in life, and who now try to 
make the best of things. 
  She looked at all the equipment. Fetal 
monitors, an ultra-sound, pap smear torture 
devices, blood pressure sleeves which dangled 
from a wall, fingertip oxygen clips, electronic 
thermometers, and stuff she couldn&#39;t put a name 
to. She resisted the urge to break out the 
guitar as she waited.
  Eventually a redheaded technician breezed in, 
weighed her, and took her vital signs. She spent 
the most time with her stethoscope pressed to 
Usagi&#39;s chest in various places. Deep breaths 
made her cough.
  The nurse made Usagi nervous. 
  At length, she cheerfully told Usagi that Dr. 
Wakai would see her momentarily. 
  Usagi repeated to herself, &#39;don&#39;t be a cynic&#39; 
a few times. 
  Meanwhile, she should leave a urine sample in 
the bathroom with her name on it, if she hadn&#39;t 
already. Clearly, it was a stall tactic, 
otherwise why wasn&#39;t it mentioned before she put 
on this ridiculous &#39;gown&#39;? 
  Usagi clutched the gown closed in the front 
and slunk down the hallway, performed, and slunk 
back to her room. She didn&#39;t ask why they wanted 
the sample... she was afraid that they&#39;d want 
blood, too! The nurse did want blood, too. 
*Sigh*
  She didn&#39;t have too long to wait after that, 
she only got half of the manufacturers memorized 
on the equipment.
  The doctor smiled at her as she entered the 
small, cluttered room. She was middle-aged with 
spectacles, she had dark short hair, and a 
medium build. Professional. Dr. Wakai&#39;s voice 
was pleasant. 
  &quot;Miss Hino is waiting in the lobby for you. If
you would like for her to accompany you, it&#39;s 
fine with me, Miss Tsukino.&quot;
  &quot;Yes, thank you. Please have her sent in, 
before she starts to abuse your staff with her 
impatience.&quot;
  Dr. Wakai winked as she used the intercom to 
call the front lobby. 
  Rei appeared a few moments later, and wore 
what she had packed in her gym bag. She had on a 
pair of faded jean shorts and a gray tank top, 
on which she had Meredith Brook&#39;s &#39;Blurring the 
Edges&#39; album cover silk-screened to. The back 
proclaimed &#39;I May Crack, but I&#39;ll Never Shatter&#39; 
penned by herself with fabric paint. 
  On her neck hung a gold necklace with a small 
ornate gold cross on it. She wore small ruby 
earrings. Strapped to her right wrist was her 
senshi communicator, and a thin golden dragon 
with a small ruby for an eye, curled around her 
left wrist. 
  Her hair was immaculate, and her manicure was 
of course, perfect. She wore open toed leather 
sandals, which prominently displayed her 
pedicure. All her nails were a bright hot red.
  When Rei saw Usagi&#39;s eyes flick to her feet, 
she stuck her tongue out at her. 
  Usagi suppressed a giggle... her bodyguard was 
certainly multifaceted! 
  Rei slouched into a chair, and tried to look 
nonchalant with her gorgeous long bare legs 
slightly open, her bare muscular arms crossed 
over her chest. Her eyes never strayed from the 
doctor.
  Dr. Wakai asked Usagi to lie down, proceeded 
to look at her surface injuries, and documented 
everything. Next, she was instructed to scoot 
all the way to the end of the table and place 
her heels in the stirrups. Dr. Wakai brought a 
bright light over to enhance her view. The 
doctor poked and prodded silently.
  Rei watched as Usagi gripped the paper into 
her fists and breathed more rapidly. Rei could 
tell she tried hard not to cry out. Rei wanted 
to fry something as a Pap smear test was done 
and tears escaped her friend&#39;s eyes. Dr. Wakai 
noticed Usagi&#39;s discomfort, too. 
  &quot;I know it must hurt, sweetie. It helps to 
relax. I&#39;ll be as gentle and quick as I can... 
I am almost finished.&quot; 
  After the culture was taken, Usagi relaxed. 
  Dr. Wakai pulled her latex examining gloves 
off after she cleaned Usagi up. 
  Rei saw blood and wanted Mamoru&#39;s on the tip 
of her sword. 
  The doctor cleared her throat and began to 
talk to Usagi.
  &quot;Miss Tsukino, you have some infections 
internally, and also superficially. We&#39;ll know 
more when the culture results come back. 
  Your temperature is elevated past the normal 
low grade temperature we see for infections. 
Your lungs don&#39;t sound clear. I suggest you go 
see your pediatrician. 
  I will write out a prescription for some 
antibiotics for your infections. You should 
start to feel less run down within a few days. 
If not, call me. You need to get plenty of 
fluids and rest. I mean it. 
  When the infections clear up, I want to 
re-examine you to determine the extent of your 
injuries. You may put your clothes back on. 
When you&#39;re done, I want to talk to you 
privately. 
  Usagi gulped and nodded. 
  Dr. Wakai closed the door behind her as she 
left.
  Rei was on her feet instantly, and teleported 
to Usagi&#39;s side. 
  &quot;Are you alright?&quot; she asked and handed Usagi 
her clothes. She watched as the clothes were put 
on mechanically in silence.
  &quot;I hurt.&quot; Usagi replied, shortly. 
  &quot;I just want to go home. Will you help me get 
home, please, Rei?&quot; 
  Rei frowned.
  &quot;I&#39;ll get you home, if that&#39;s what you really 
want. Do you want me to cancel our dinner date 
tonight, too?&quot; Rei asked uncertainly.
  Usagi nodded soberly. 
  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Rei, I&#39;m just so tired... I don&#39;t 
think I&#39;d be very good company. I... I really 
don&#39;t feel too well.&quot; Usagi finally admitted. 
&quot;Besides, it is already 5:30 and I&#39;m still stuck 
here.&quot; 
  Rei was a little disappointed but smiled. She 
leaned forward and kissed Usagi&#39;s lips gently. 
Her lips were a lot warmer now than they were 
this morning. Rei felt her stomach flip in fear.
  &quot;Mmm, good point, I&#39;d better call them. It&#39;s 
ok, really, I think they&#39;d rather have 
cancellations then try to fit in reservations! 
Don&#39;t worry, I completely understand your needs. 
  Do you remember the salad you made for lunch?&quot;
  Usagi nodded. 
  Rei grinned. 
  &quot;Well, between all the heat and all the 
action, I tossed it on Professor Ippongi&#39;s 
sideline. He exiled me to the showers, and 
voila, I&#39;m here.&quot;
  Usagi was concerned. 
  &quot;Rei, you needed that food and you especially 
needed those liquids.&quot; 
  Rei&#39;s finger touched under Usagi&#39;s chin. 
  &quot;Usagi, I didn&#39;t toss it on purpose! I had the 
ball, and suddenly needed to get rid of it, so I 
could run off of the field. 
  Don&#39;t worry, Mako looked after me. After she 
yelled at me for my stupidity, she bought me a 
sports drink.&quot; 
  Rei stroked Usagi&#39;s cheek with a long finger.
  &quot;I think the Starlight Tower&#39;s other customers 
would frown upon my tossing a salad, ne?&quot; 
  Usagi gave the barest of smiles. 
  &quot;I&#39;d be happy to call your mom and have her 
pick you up from here. I just need her cell 
phone number. 
  We&#39;ll go out when we both can enjoy it.&quot; Rei 
planted a warm wet kiss where Usagi&#39;s crescent 
sigil would show on her forehead. 
  &quot;I&#39;ll be in the lobby, &#39;K?&quot; Rei said as Dr. 
Wakai rapped on the door.
  Usagi called out.
  &quot;Come in, I&#39;m decent.&quot; 
  Rei opened the door to let the doctor in and 
herself out.
  Dr. Wakai thanked her politely and told her it 
would not take long. 
  &quot;Take your time. We have to wait for Usagi&#39;s 
mom anyway.&quot; Rei returned just as politely, then 
added, &quot;besides, it might be fun to make an 
adult wait on us, for a change!&quot; Her mischievous 
eyes glinted at the doctor.
  Dr. Wakai looked at Usagi. 
  &quot;She really is evil, isn&#39;t she?&quot;
  &quot;Yup.&quot; Usagi agreed.
  The doctor quirked a smile.
  &quot;How ever do you put up with her, you&#39;re so 
sweet!&quot; 
  Rei made gagging noises with her hands 
clutching at her throat.
  Usagi sighed loudly. 
  &quot;Alas, I must confess... the girl amuses me.&quot; 
  Rei stuck her nose in the air and sniffed. 
  &quot;Hmph, I think the air smells like hogwash in 
here!&quot; 
  Rei left to go find a phone to call Mrs. 
Tsukino, and the restaurant. 
  Dr. Wakai and Usagi giggled like a pair of 
schoolgirls with a secret.

                   * * *          
  When the door was shut once more, Dr. Wakai 
turned towards Usagi and indicated for her to 
sit in the chair Rei had vacated. 
  &quot;Miss Tsukino, do you know the person who 
molested, and raped you?&quot;
  Usagi looked down and cringed at the bluntness 
of the terms. 
  &quot;Hai,&quot; she whispered.
  &quot;How long has this gone on, and why didn&#39;t you 
come to get help sooner, or call the authorities 
so this won&#39;t be repeated?&quot; Dr. Wakai asked.
  Usagi calmed down before she answered quietly. 
  &quot;It has gone on about a week, or two. It&#39;s my 
fianc&eacute;e whom I&#39;ve let do this to me. Our 
relationship has been full of love for years, 
but he has changed recently. 
  I thought the abuse would stop when our lives 
settled down. He insisted he still loved me, but 
he grew rougher. 
  I didn&#39;t want to ruin his life and turn him 
in. I still love him. But I can&#39;t continue in 
the relationship the way it is. My intention is 
to provide him with professional help.&quot;
  Dr. Wakai was silent for a moment before she 
responded in the same quiet tone.
  &quot;Usagi, if you insist on his protection, I 
can&#39;t stop you. Your blood tests show you are 
not pregnant, and you don&#39;t have any STDs, 
luckily. If you truly wish him well, I suggest 
you get him that help right away before those 
situations change. 
  Do you have an agency in mind? If not... I 
will provide you with one.&quot;
  &quot;Yes, I have someone in mind. It&#39;s not an 
agency, but rather an eminently qualified 
individual... Dr. Setsuna Meioh. 
  She is most known for her clothing designs, I 
know, but besides graduating top of her class in 
Theories of Elemental Science, she also majored 
in Psychology. She has had extensive practice in 
counseling. (For, like, millennia, hee-hee!) 
She&#39;s also a personal friend of mine, and I 
trust her implicitly.&quot;
  Dr. Wakai was skeptical. 
  &quot;All right, Miss Tsukino. I&#39;m will trust your 
judgment, but let me warn you, it won&#39;t be hard 
to find out who you&#39;ve been with. If you come 
back to mine, or any other office in this 
condition, I will have him prosecuted to the 
fullest extent of the law. All these offices 
share a database on abuse cases. Are we on the 
same page, Miss Tsukino?&quot;
  &quot;Hai, the message is loud and clear.&quot; Usagi 
answered with trepidation and wondered if her 
plan would work.
  &quot;Good, I expect you back here in one week, 
that&#39;s next Monday Miss Tsukino, to see if any 
permanent damage has been sustained. 
  Your boyfriend has exactly one week to enroll 
himself into professional care. You may go now. 
Please see my secretary to make your next 
appointment. You may pick up your prescription 
at the pharmacy next door... it&#39;s already been 
called in.&quot; 
  Dr. Wakai smiled at her finally, and squeezed 
her hand before she collected Usagi&#39;s folder. 
  &quot;You&#39;re a courageous young lady, and a 
survivor, just like your friend Rei. Only you 
seem a little gentler, and more forgiving. 
  I always get the impression if she really 
wanted to, she could reduce something to ashes 
with her glare!&quot;
  Usagi tried to conceal her mirth with a hand 
over her mouth, but a giggle came out. She had 
no idea how right she was!!
  With a hand on the doorknob, Dr. Wakai gave 
Usagi a last look. 
  &quot;You know, most people would be crushed under 
the amount of pain you are in emotionally and 
physically. Please take care of yourself from 
now on. You are very special. I hope you feel 
better soon.&quot; 
  Dr. Wakai left the door ajar and went to her 
next patient. 
  Usagi&#39;s smile faded as the doctor left and 
thought to her self... I&#39;m not &#39;normal&#39;. And I&#39;m 
not as brave as you think I am. I do feel 
crushed. 
  Usagi went to the lobby with her guitar. 
  She paid the secretary and set up her next 
appointment for the following Monday. When she 
finished, she saw her mom and Rei as they sat 
and chatted together animatedly. 
  Her mother certainly loved teenagers. It was a 
most welcomed sight. 
  Ikuko stood gracefully at the appearance of 
her daughter a curious expression on her face. 
  &quot;Let&#39;s go, everyone! Rei, you&#39;re welcomed to 
stay for dinner, if you want to.&quot;
  Rei scratched her chin thoughtfully. 
  &quot;Hmm, I have to choose between a good 
home-cooked meal made by you, or leftovers 
courtesy of Usagi?&quot; She looked from one to the 
other, and feigned indecision.
  &quot;Mom, isn&#39;t it my turn to cook?&quot; Usagi asked, 
and stuck her tongue out at Rei. 
  She retrieved her backpack from the hook she 
had put it on. 
  &quot;Mom, I have to pick up a prescription next 
door, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; 
  Ikuko stopped her with a hand to the forearm.
  &quot;No, you don&#39;t, Rei mentioned it, and I 
already picked it up.&quot; Ikuko dangled a small 
plastic bag in her face. And it&#39;s my turn to 
cook! Get in the car, now, both of you!&quot; Ikuko 
ordered.
  &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am!&quot; Both girls said in unison, and 
piled into the back seat of the white Accord on 
the right side behind Ikuko. 
  Rei went first with Usagi&#39;s guitar, put her 
own gym bag and backpack on the seat next to 
her, and took the seat in the middle so Usagi 
could sit next to the other door. 
  Usagi leaned forward and across Rei to plop 
her backpack into the empty front passenger 
seat. 
  Usagi felt completely drained as she sat down. 
Her body ached, and she wanted desperately to 
sleep. She laid her head on the window, but 
discovered Rei&#39;s shoulder was far more 
comfortable. 
  Usagi closed her eyes and was asleep 
instantly.
  Mrs. Tsukino looked in her rearview mirror. 
She wondered why two usually argumentative noisy 
teenagers were so quiet. What she saw was a pale 
Usagi with bright pink spots on her cheeks, her 
head cradled on Rei&#39;s neck. 
  Rei&#39;s arm was around Usagi&#39;s shoulder, her 
features had softened to tenderly reflect a love 
and concern Ikuko would have never imagined on 
Rei&#39;s usually hard countenance. 
  Ikuko pondered the possible meanings in her 
heart. Her daughter looked genuinely ill, and 
Rei seemed inordinately worried and protective. 
  Ikuko began to worry that something awful had 
happened. Was Usagi pregnant? She knew her 
normally open daughter would talk to her in due 
time, and was grateful they had such a good 
relationship.
