<h1>A Time and a Place for Everything (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krysbear.html">Krys Bear</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeplace-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;Hey now. Come on. We don&#39;t need no crashing punks like you around
here. Get yer sorry ass up and go on home.&quot;

Makoto blinked and shook her head, trying to focus her eyes. &quot;Where am
I...where&#39;s Minako, and-&quot;

She was interrupted by a face full of broom bristles, wielded by a
prune faced, bitter old woman. &quot;Damn kids, always crashin and burnin
and jackin up and whatever else it is that you do in my lot! I&#39;ve had
it! I see you in here again, I&#39;m gonna call the police! In fact, you
don&#39;t leave right now, I&#39;ll call the police anyway!&quot;

Makoto staggered to her feet. &quot;Hey, wait, I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t know what
happened, just tell me where I am and I&#39;ll go.&quot;

The crone eyed her warily. &quot;You&#39;re high, aintcha? Well, if it&#39;ll get
you offa my property, you&#39;re on the west side of Juuban. Across from
the pharmacy. In _MY_ lot. It&#39;s about midnight. Now go away.&quot;

Makoto mumbled her thanks and clumsily made her way back onto the
sidewalk. ~What the hell happened to me? What am I doing? Last thing I
remember is being in bed with Minako...NO! Being in bed with a very
young Minako...no wait..I need to sit down and clear my head.~

Makoto looked around for a place she could find mental refuge. She
crossed the street to the pharmacy, which had just closed for the
evening, and crouched down in its shadowed doorframe. &quot;Alright,&quot; she
started, finding comfort and rationality in the sound of her own voice,
&quot;One step at a time, Mako.&quot;

Makoto closed her eyes and took a deep breath. All she had to do was
follow her own advice, and take this one step at a time, and all would
fall into place. She remembered waking up to the glorious sunshine this
morning, with a surety in her heart. Today would be the day she told
Minako how she felt, no matter what the repercussions may be. Shortly
after that, Minako had called and invited her over to dinner,
convincing her that today was her day of destiny. She had left her
apartment to go to Minako&#39;s, and then...

And then the odd flower woman.

And then...Peeko.

The lot she had just woken up in was only a few steps away from where
she had received the fuzzy trigger. ~I must have blacked out
there...and everything else I was experiencing was a memory...~

It was only then that Makoto looked down at her hands. In them, she was
still clutching Peeko. She felt her throat tighten, and her eyes sting
with tears she refused to shed. ~She loved me then...Minako loved me.
And I loved her too....so much...that&#39;s why I feel this way about her
now.~ Her breath became shaky. ~For so long I&#39;ve felt so
guilty...feeling the way I do. I&#39;ve been so scared...fearing rejection.
And now....now I remember...Minako was in love with me...once...long
ago. But it was all so long ago.~

Makoto held Peeko tightly. &quot;I don&#39;t remember everything,&quot; she whispered
to him, &quot;Actually...I don&#39;t remember much at all. But I think...now,
I&#39;ll start remembering more. We never remembered much of anything about
our pasts...me and the other senshi. But I&#39;m getting it back
now...thanks to you.&quot;

They were silent for a moment, both gift and receiver...one lost in
thoughts and emotion, the other lost in a desperate grip.

Makoto had been in that dark doorframe for about an hour until she
finally pulled herself together well enough to bring herself home. She
had gone over the situation in her mind, and decided that she would
have to tell Minako everything she knew. In a way, this would make
things easier on her. She didn&#39;t have to worry about how she was going
to tell the blonde. She could just give her Peeko, and maybe the fuzzy
little magician would work his magic on her as well. Then she&#39;d never
have to say anything. Everything would be said without a word.

And then they could see where to go from there, together.

As Makoto unlocked the door, she inwardly cringed a little with the
realization that Minako must be worried about her. After all, she never
showed up for dinner, and never called. And she hadn&#39;t carried her
communicator with her either. ~I&#39;ve got to call her right away. No,
wait, it&#39;s late and her parents would kill me...her mom is such a hag
anyways...~

Deciding she would call anyways, whether Minako&#39;s mother liked it or
not, Makoto pushed open the door and stepped into her apartment. She
froze immediately. Something wasn&#39;t right.

She wasn&#39;t alone.

Quietly she slipped her keys on their small hook by the door. She
flicked on the lights, and stepped into a defensive stance. &quot;Hey!&quot; she
called out, snarling. &quot;You better step out here and explain yourself,
or I&#39;m going to mess you up real bad!&quot;

There was a shuffle in her living room, and she bolted in to see who
the intruder was. &quot;I told you that-&quot;

&quot;Where the hell have you been?&quot;

Makoto stopped and lowered her fists, as she faced a very perturbed
Minako. &quot;Mina-chan,&quot; she swallowed. &quot;Wha....what are you doing here?&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Minako sang sarcastically, &quot;I was just sitting here, worried sick
because you seemed to have fallen off the face of the earth for nearly
twelve hours! Jesus Makoto, why didn&#39;t you call? What happened to you?
I&#39;ve been trying to reach you for hours, and all I got was your
answering machine. Then I tried your communicator, and apparently you
didn&#39;t have that with you. Then I came over here, to see if your
communicator could get a lock on you anywhere, and all I got were funny
symbols and static on the screen!&quot;

Makoto remained silent for a moment, deciding it best to wait until the
temperamental blonde was through venting. Then she could answer her
questions one by one.

But that was the end of the tirade, and before Makoto could even mumble
an apology she was held fast in a shaky hug. &quot;You&#39;re ok though, that&#39;s
the important thing. You&#39;re ok, and you&#39;re home now.&quot;

Makoto closed her eyes and wrapped her arms around Minako. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry...something crazy happened today, and it involves you, and the
silver millennium, and...and I have so much to say, and I don&#39;t know
where to start. I don&#39;t think I even can start.&quot;

Minako pulled away and looked up at Mako. &quot;Try just starting from the
beginning. Just try.&quot; she whispered softly as she sat down in front of
the taller girl.

Makoto looked down at her feet. She didn&#39;t have enough time to find a
way to tell Minako. She started trying to tell the blond, but every
time she approached it, nothing came out. Finally, she did the only
thing she could do. She took Peeko out of her pocket, and put him into
Minako&#39;s hands.

For a moments eternity, neither said a word. Makoto stood, looking at
the floor, and stealing glances at Minako every so often. Minako just
looked at Peeko, transfixed.

About five minutes of silence passed. But it seemed so much longer.
Finally, Minako looked up at Makoto. &quot;So...this means that you finally
remember.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean finally? I...don&#39;t you...understand what this
represents? None....none of us besides Usagi know very much about our
pasts. I...&quot; she stopped, not knowing what to say. Minako&#39;s statement
was so unexpected, she was thrown for a loop. Finally she asked the
only thing she could ask.

&quot;Why isn&#39;t this surprising you? You&#39;re not reacting,
Mina-chan...I...don&#39;t know what to do with that.&quot;

Minako sighed and turned away. &quot;Makoto. I don&#39;t know what to say right
now either. All I can tell you is...that I already know. Everything.
Everything you just remembered and more. I&#39;ve been aware of my past
since I was fourteen years old. ALL of my past.&quot; She stood up and
slipped her shoes on. &quot;I think that its probably best if I go home
now,&quot; she murmured, almost inaudibly.

Author&#39;s Notes:

First of all, I want everyone to know that this is _not_ the end of my
M&amp;M tale. In fact, it&#39;s just the beginning.

Originally this was going to be a very long fic focusing on the silver
millennium, and Minako and Makoto&#39;s relationship at that time. But muses
are funny creatures, and I was struck by a new inspiration. I want to
go one better than that. So, that being said, what you have just
finished reading is the first part of a trilogy. A Time and Place for
Everything will continue, it is only this part that has come to a
conclusion.

Now, I know there are a lot of loose ends and confusing pieces that are
not explained well in A time and Place for Everything, but understand
this. THAT IS THE WAY I INTENDED IT. By the time I have finished the
trilogy, everything will fit perfectly, and all will be revealed and
understood. Just be patient, and I promise I won&#39;t disappoint you.

For those interested in knowing, this was my first attempt at writing a
fanfic.

Comments, suggestions, and critiques are very much appreciated. Thank
you to everyone who has already written me fanmail and suggestions on
how I could make this fic better.
