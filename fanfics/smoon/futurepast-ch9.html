Michiru floated on her back, the water lapping gently at her chin and 
face, the swell of her breasts, her kneecaps. Always in tune to her 
element, though her eyes were shut, she could sense the emptiness of her 
surroundings of the indoor pool. The slightest motion of the backstroke 
propelled her backwards, yet even as her limbs deftly slid in and out of 
the water, not a ripple was left on the liquid&#39;s smooth surface. She 
could have been a part of the element that surrounded her, a molecule of 
the calm waters she was composed of.

Calm... were it not for the tumultuous emotions that raged within her 
mind, the intensity of which threatened to trigger a destructive tsunami 
across the collected composure that Michiru displayed.

It had been a week since she had first met Haruka at her school&#39;s track 
race, a week since her would be partner had rejected her. In those seven 
days, her high hopes of finding the tall blonde had faded to the stress 
of school, violin rehearsals, and a couple of youma battles, their 
frequency and intensity seemingly increasing.

Her hopes of again finding her cold and stoic shell of a lover from ages 
past had been relegated to the confines of the deepest reaches of her 
mind. Meanwhile, the forefront of her mind was laden with images of the 
impending silence which continued to ravage her dreams, sapping her much 
needed strength, stealing her breath as freezing tidal waves of ice cold 
water threatened to destroy the future...

The muted sound of Michiru&#39;s cell phone filtered through the water to 
reach her ears. Her initial thought was to ignore the call and remain in 
her blessed solitude, but her intuition gripped her strongly. She knew 
the call would be important. With fluid speed and agility, Michiru&#39;s 
lithe body slid through the water, and with the grace of a sea nymph, 
she launched herself from her element to sit elegantly on the pool deck.

Noting the call was from was her manager her hopeful expression fell. 
&quot;This is Michiru.&quot; She said shortly. Apparently her intuition had been 
strangely wrong. The last thing she wanted was to be hounded about 
performing a concert in her busy and exhausted state.

As her excitable manager launched into a furious proposal, she quickly 
cut him to the chase. &quot;Pass.&quot; She said, preempting him. She raised an 
eyebrow, having realized that in this life, she had adopted Haruka&#39;s 
mannerisms as quickly as she had in her past one.

&quot;But Michiru-san, this is the third concert you&#39;ve refused this week! 
You simply must think of your career, your fans are waiting for you!&quot; 
The limp-willed man on the other end of the line almost begged.

&#39;Career.&#39; Michiru thought with a snort. Unlike Haruka, she had put her 
future on hold to embrace her past. The cobalt eyed girl sighed as she 
pushed wet strands of hair to the other side of her neck. She couldn&#39;t 
deny that she missed performing her music in front of a crowd...

Her manager capitalized on his prot&eacute;g&eacute;&#39;s wavering resolve. &quot;You simply 
must attend this gig, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll enjoy it. A formal midnight cruise 
to benefit some local charity or the other. But there&#39;ll be five star 
food, and from what I understand, a lot of celebrities.&quot;

Michiru rolled her eyes, as if she were that kind of girl. After three 
years with her manager, she had expected more from him. She prepared to 
interrupt and refuse his offer as he rattled off celebrity names in a 
blur.

&quot;Listen,&quot; Michiru cut in, but then stopped short as she heard a familiar 
name. &quot;Wait, who did you just say?&quot; She asked with sharp curiosity.

Her manager jumped, excitement in his voice. &quot;I should have known you&#39;d 
be interested in him! Tenoh Haruka, he and his sponsors will be there to 
promote-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go. I&#39;ll expect to see my limo at six, sharp.&quot; Michiru said 
curtly, and without another word, she ended the call abruptly. She set 
her cell back on the pool&#39;s edge before slipping back into the water&#39;s 
welcoming embrace. She dove deeper to escape the grating ring of her 
phone, no doubt her manager was attempting to call her back to discuss 
specifics she couldn&#39;t care less about.

Finally sure of no further interruptions, Michiru again surfaced after 
trusting her lungs to the water for what might have seemed far too long 
for a mere human. Retreating to a motionless float on her back, her 
cobalt eyes stared unseeing at the monotonous ceiling above her.

&#39;Tonight our paths will cross again.&#39;

Michiru found herself digging deep within her heart to find the hopes 
she had relied on after her first meeting with Haruka. Her hopes that, 
if she could somehow help Haruka to understand that destiny and duty 
were not the same, and that neither would bring her hardship, that the 
troubled woman would let down her heavily fortified defenses that the 
devastated Uranus had built around herself eight hundred years ago, 
where she was sure, her original, carefree personality still existed. 
Her mind began to wander as she wondered how she would approach the 
flighty woman this time, how she could try to convince her that she 
wasn&#39;t someone to be scared of.

As she floated aimlessly, Michiru realized that she needed to understand 
how Haruka dealt with stress if she were to succeed in winning her over. 
She had certainly already found how not to interact with the bitter, 
avoidant woman.

Michiru had many memories of her interactions with the carefree Haruka 
of ages past, but how should she approach her if she were bitter and 
closed? She wondered if she and Haruka had ever had a misunderstanding, 
or even an argument during their past lives. Certainly they must have, 
but how would she have dealt with a fearful, retreating Haruka?

Somehow, Michiru felt she had dealt with it poorly...

flashback

Pluto wore a mischievous smile on her lips as she led her fellow outer 
senshi through the inner chambers of the Moon Palace.

&quot;I don&#39;t see what you think is so funny, Pluto.&quot; Uranus grumbled. &quot;You 
have to baby-sit with us too.&quot;

&quot;Ara?&quot; Neptune exclaimed jokingly, raising her eyebrows at her partner 
as she recalled how she had found Haruka flirting with Princess Serenity 
the very first time she had met the hazel eyed woman. &quot;Last I remember, 
you found yourself quite enamored with our young Princess.&quot;

Uranus snorted in defiance, allowing the heels of her heavy boots to 
fill the silence. The tension between Neptune and herself had been at a 
stagnant breaking point for weeks. Their ritualistic flirting had 
reached a point of no return and had almost become their only form of 
communication. Uranus didn&#39;t know what had caused the change, she only 
knew that something had to be done about it, and soon.

Neptune eyed her brooding partner warily, feeding off her irritated 
emotions while still trying to focus on the task at hand. For as much as 
her own thoughts of her partner and their precariously undefined 
relationship consumed her, currently they held a duty to the Princess of 
the Moon.

It had been months since they had last seen the inner senshi or even the 
Moon Princess. The training regime of the outers had kept them fairly 
isolated from their younger counterparts, and although each group of 
senshi held some amount of respect for the other, there was not enough 
time for friendship, let alone any information sharing. The inners 
didn&#39;t even know of the recent birth of Saturn&#39;s would be senshi, that 
the child proclaimed to destroy their solar system had been living among 
them for months. The senshi of the ocean suspected that the inners were 
weary of leaving the Princess in the protection of the outers, even if 
only for one day&#39;s time while they traveled abroad for training of their 
own.

Pluto stopped abruptly, her two brooding allies behind her almost 
falling on top of each other in a mess of limbs as she knocked on the 
door purposefully. The sound of excited footsteps rushed forward and the 
door quickly swung open, followed by the musical voice of the Moon 
Princess. &quot;Pluto! Neptune! Uranus! It&#39;ll be so fun to spend the day 
together!&quot;

The three outer senshi bowed politely to Serenity II, feeling somewhat 
awkward in the exuberant girl&#39;s unbridled enthusiasm, her openness and 
purity somewhat alien to their more repressed nature.

Pluto placed encouraging hands on the shoulders of her friends, pushing 
them forward into the young Serenity&#39;s chambers. &quot;My regrets, my 
Princess, but I have a duty to the Time Gate which I must attend to 
first. Will you accept my deepest apologies?&quot;

Serenity didn&#39;t notice the cold stares of surprise that Uranus and 
Neptune gave to the green haired woman as her own challenging smile met 
Pluto&#39;s questioning gaze. &quot;Only if you stop addressing me so formally.&quot; 
She stated bravely.

The guardian of the Time Gate smiled genuinely. &quot;You&#39;re just like your 
mother, Serenity-chan.&quot; The young blonde beamed with pride at Pluto&#39;s 
compliment. &quot;I&#39;ll return just as soon as I can.&quot;

The garnet eyed woman addressed the Queen&#39;s daughter kindly before 
turning back to her two allies. &quot;Who knows, you two may learn something 
important today.&quot; She said enigmatically.

Pluto smirked knowingly at the obviously stressed and suddenly seemingly 
deserted pair of Neptune and Uranus as she turned to retreat. Although 
they would be painful lessons, they&#39;d each learn something important 
that day and though they were unaware of such a fact, it was not Pluto&#39;s 
role to interfere.

Uranus cursed as she banged her knees on the bottom of the low table. 
She had long ago given up trying to drink the tea from the delicate cup, 
the giggles she received from Serenity and Neptune for her poor 
etiquette had been a deterrent enough.

&quot;Fuckingteaparty.&quot; She grumbled. Who had ever heard of a senshi at high 
tea, anyway? She glared at the decorative finger sandwiches in disdain.

&quot;Uranus, did you say something?&quot; Cobalt eyes met stormy gray ones and 
Neptune could barely contain her laughter. The afternoon tea party with 
the Princess and the tomboy had been priceless. Pluto was missing out on 
a great show.

The senshi of the wind glared at her partner, attempting anger, but 
knowing she was incapable of feeling that emotion for the other woman. 
She settled with looking away, only to be met with her Princess&#39; large, 
shining blue eyes.

Uranus&#39; heart skipped a beat. She slipped into familiar territory and 
allowed her mouth to do the talking for her. Her eyes softened and her 
voice lowered, she barely realized she was flirting so shamelessly as 
she laid on the charm. Her golden bangs framed her face handsomely as 
she lowered her elbow to the table and propped her chin in her hands, 
her eyes taking in only her Princess. &quot;Now, Serenity, wouldn&#39;t you say 
that Neptune here is being rather harsh? You wouldn&#39;t treat me so 
terribly, would you?&quot;

Neptune&#39;s insides twisted, her cobalt eyes narrowing as she watched her 
partner fawn over Serenity, her head in her hand, her eyes distant, her 
expression relaxed completely. Uranus was caught in the young Moon 
heir&#39;s beauty. &#39;This is all wrong. She&#39;s only supposed to look like that 
when she&#39;s talking to me.&#39; The senshi of the ocean had seen Haruka flirt 
with others before, it was almost an every day occurrence, but the 
intensity in her partner&#39;s hazel eyes at that moment suddenly frightened 
Neptune.

&#39;Only me.&#39; She repeated to herself.

Not sensing Neptune&#39;s inner turmoil, the young Princess giggled, 
inherently understanding that her older friend was merely teasing her 
and Uranus found a smile spreading across her own face. The Uranian had 
always been attracted to her Princess, it was hard not to be, the young 
woman simply radiated beauty. But staring into her azure depths, Uranus 
quickly found that her attraction to Serenity was neither physical nor 
mental, nor was it a romantic attraction at all.

Finally, the realization slammed into her. It was a kinship she felt for 
the young woman.

In Serenity, the senshi of the wind saw her own object of affection. She 
saw Michiru. She saw Neptune. In Serenity, Uranus saw gentle beauty, 
tender naivety, and a definite, albeit, hidden grace that just waited 
for the blue eyed blonde to mature. And Uranus realized that she wanted 
nothing more than to protect her Princess&#39; innocence that reminded her 
so much of her own partner.

The revelation gripped the edgy woman and her mind responded to her 
heart. After the three years she&#39;d spent with her partner, all the 
flirting, the near misses, the depth of emotion she felt for the other 
woman, she had finally pinpointed why she loved her partner so deeply. 
Though her own soul had already known, her mind now buzzed with the 
striking knowledge.

The senshi of the wind realized all too late the obvious blush that had 
crawled up her cheeks and that, though she was thinking of Neptune, she 
was staring at Serenity.

&quot;Uranus, are you okay?&quot; The long haired blonde asked with endless 
concern. &quot;You&#39;re all red, are you feeling hot?&quot;

&quot;Hot?&quot; Neptune proposed, making an effort to keep the sharp edge from 
her voice.

The senshi of the ocean hid her irritation that grew as her partner 
refused to meet her gaze. She knew all too well that her relationship 
with Uranus was undefined, a friendship that bordered on something more. 
But Uranus had no real obligation to her. She was free to do what she 
wanted, no matter how much the Neptunian&#39;s heart might object.

She painted a broad smile on her face and managed to wear it well. 
&quot;She&#39;s fine, Serenity-chan, don&#39;t mind the staring idiot.&quot;

Uranus winced. Her partner&#39;s voice was light and teasing, but she could 
detect a trace of annoyance that she had caused. She finally met 
Neptune&#39;s icy cobalt eyes, feeling like a deer caught in the headlights. 
She didn&#39;t need her partner&#39;s uncanny sense of intuition to detect 
jealousy.

&#39;Why jealousy? We&#39;re only partners, nothing more.&#39; Uranus told herself. 
Despite the constant innuendo between them, their flirting was only a 
game they played, right? Surely Neptune wouldn&#39;t consider otherwise. For 
all their closeness, the aqua haired woman had never suggested wanting 
anything more than friendship.

&#39;But neither have I.&#39; Uranus realized.

Serenity giggled, oblivious to the growing tension between the two outer 
senshi. &quot;Don&#39;t say that, Neptune! After all, Uranus and yourself are 
just like Endymion and I, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

A painful silence froze the room, though the Princess of the Moon didn&#39;t 
notice the numbing cold. Neptune and Uranus found they couldn&#39;t meet 
each other&#39;s gaze, both at an absolute loss for words. How could their 
Princess suggest that the feelings they shared for each other were as 
strong as the well known love of Endymion and Serenity?

Young Serenity gasped, startled as she noticed the time. &quot;I&#39;m late for 
my lessons!&quot;

In a gangly mess of limbs, the forgetful long haired girl leapt from her 
chair, spilling her tea in the process as she apologized profusely. She 
threw hurried arms around her friends&#39; shoulders, a quick hug of thanks 
accompanied with a genuine smile.

&quot;Will I see you after my lessons?&quot; She asked hopefully.

The outer senshi managed tentative nods to reassure her and the not so 
graceful blonde ran off to her tutoring, leaving the pair in an awkward 
silence in her wake.

&quot;That silly girl.&quot; Neptune said tersely, making an attempt to ease the 
mounting tension, though she noticed her voice had grown sharp. She 
began to wonder why Uranus still hadn&#39;t stood up for herself, it was 
unlike her bold friend to remain silent after such an accusation.

The tall blonde swallowed audibly, feeling Neptune&#39;s eyes on her. Her 
partner was upset and she was the cause. Uranus only hoped that the 
Neptunian was upset with her shameless flirting over their Princess and 
not Serenity&#39;s implication that the two of them shared a romantic 
relationship.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Uranus blurted out uncharacteristically, once again 
submerging the atmosphere into awkwardness.

&quot;For what?&quot; Neptune asked rhetorically, though her voice was laced with 
accusation.

Uranus frowned, knowing that even though she was trying to make amends, 
her partner was becoming confrontational. &quot;For flirting with her!&quot;

&quot;Ara!&quot; Neptune blinked, finding herself at a loss. She had expected her 
partner to stand up for herself, not apologize. It was unlike Uranus to 
feel the need to prove herself to anyone, even to her. &quot;It&#39;s in your 
nature to be an egotistical flirt, is it not?&quot;

Uranus opened her mouth, wanting to prove Neptune wrong, needing to tell 
her how she felt, needing to ease the terrible misunderstanding she had 
caused. She was on the verge of revealing her true feelings.

&quot;It&#39;s not like that, I just want to... protect her for some reason.&quot; 
Uranus ground out.

Something inside Neptune snapped. Her calm, patient nature yielded to 
her sudden frustration, the jealousy she felt overcoming her far too 
easily. &quot;Why should I care how you feel about her?&quot;

Neptune gasped, surprised at the venom in her voice. She hadn&#39;t meant to 
come across so harsh, yet she suddenly found she couldn&#39;t stop herself. 
Years spent containing her emotions for her partner culminating, her 
mouth continued, her brain struggling to catch up. &quot;You&#39;d bed any woman 
you&#39;d come across, even the Princess! Right? Every woman except for me!&quot;

Both women froze in the wake of the strong words Neptune had flung. A 
blush tinted the cheeks of the aqua haired woman, but was overpowered by 
the one that dominated Uranus&#39; own. The senshi of the wind&#39;s mind 
reeled. Did she detect regret from her partner? More jealousy? Was the 
prim and proper Neptune upset that she&#39;d made no effort to get into her 
bed? &#39;Ridiculous! Neptune would never...&#39;

Icy cobalt eyes bore down on her and Uranus knew she needed to supply an 
answer. She longed to pull the smaller girl into her arms, tell her that 
the only woman she wanted to bed was none other than herself, but how 
would she react, was that really what she wanted to hear?

&#39;Maybe it is. Maybe the past three years of flirting and teasing really 
wasn&#39;t a joke...&#39; But could she lay it all on the line?

Uranus&#39; fists clenched tightly. &quot;It&#39;s not about Serenity, Neptune, it&#39;s 
about-&quot;

Neptune was unhearing as she interrupted her partner, the two of them 
speaking at the same time. &quot;Don&#39;t think I&#39;m stopping you, Uranus. Last 
time I checked, there was nothing more than friendship between you and 
I. Or am I wrong?&quot;

Uranus&#39; mouth clicked shut, Neptune&#39;s cobalt eyes boring into her, 
tantalizing her, begging her to prove her statement wrong as she 
desperately wanted to do... yet in the confrontational atmosphere, the 
tension so great, Uranus crumbled under the pressure, her desire to open 
up to her partner while being pushed so hard deflated. Was Neptune 
fishing for an honest answer or was she pushing her away?

&quot;Forget it!&quot; Uranus spat, all thoughts of explaining to her partner how 
she felt scattering to the winds she longed to run into. &quot;Just forget 
any of this ever happened.&quot;

The senshi of the wind&#39;s clouded eyes dared Neptune to think otherwise. 
The conversation was over. Done. Never to be brought up again. Unable to 
read her stormy partner&#39;s intentions, Uranus turned and walked away, 
slamming the heavy door shut behind her, picking up her post outside of 
Serenity&#39;s chambers.

Neptune stood on shaky legs, cursing herself for driving her partner 
away in her own frustration, realizing her mistake of pushing her 
tentative partner far too late, finally understanding that she had 
interrupted something terribly important.

&#39;What have I done?&#39;

/flashback

Michiru was drowning.

Literally, her body was completely submerged, her element as upset as 
she was. Finally snapping back to reality, she broke the water&#39;s surface 
and lent her arms on the pool&#39;s edge for support. She had learned that, 
in her past, she had ruined what she was sure would have been Uranus&#39; 
confession of her feelings for her. She had ruined it as a result of her 
jealous and impatient urges. Even knowing that her partner was apt to 
run from confrontation and that she did not like being placed on the 
spot, she had tried to force an answer from her, an answer that may have 
been what they had both been looking for, had she not crossed signals 
with her partner.

She almost laughed at the irony as she pushed her wet bangs from her 
eyes. Very vaguely, Michiru could remember having gotten all worked up 
that day for nothing, for shortly after, they had confessed their love 
for one another. Not long after that very fight, Haruka had cleared up 
her feelings for Serenity, and once having learned that Haruka had only 
compared Serenity&#39;s beauty to her own and that her Princess had only 
served as a catalyst to Haruka&#39;s understanding of her love for Michiru, 
the aqua haired girl had felt rather foolish.

She still did, eight hundred years later.

Michiru pulled herself from the pool, droplets of water sliding from her 
skin. Now she was equipped with the knowledge of that which would drive 
Haruka away from her. After reliving that old memory, she knew how to 
better deal with a flighty Haruka. If she could keep herself from coming 
on too strongly or backing Haruka into a corner, Haruka was less likely 
to run from her.

If only she could reign in her own emotions.

&#39;Pluto had been right.&#39; Michiru realized with a smile. She had learned 
something important that day. If only she hadn&#39;t realized it eight 
hundred years after the fact!

And so the question remained to be asked, could she learn from the 
mistakes of her past, or would history repeat itself once again?

----------

Haruka&#39;s tuxedo collar itched as she sat stiffly at a table on the deck 
of the yacht, nursing some alcoholic concoction, which was nothing if 
not orange. Sometimes her famous persona came in handy. Had they known 
she was underage, let alone female, she wouldn&#39;t have had half of what 
she had accomplished in her young life.

&#39;Not that it amounts to anything in the end.&#39; Her negativity reminded 
her.

The quiet murmurings of the crowd breathed a collective gasp as the 
sound of a brilliant violin caught their attention. The spotlights 
turned to the stage where they illuminated an elegant, young, aqua 
haired woman. Resplendent in her ivory gown, her graceful fingers coaxed 
gentle music from her violin.

It was music that Haruka didn&#39;t hear as her breath stuck in her throat. 
Caught between intensely warring emotions, the urge to run both to and 
from the cobalt eyed woman ravaged her. Fate had determined that they 
meet again. Fate had given her another chance to accept this woman who 
needed her so desperately.

Fate was meddling in affairs that Haruka wanted no part of.

The graceful woman stood on the stage as though she were the only person 
on the yacht. Her confident presence commanded respect and her 
calculated motions spoke with maturity. Though she didn&#39;t make eye 
contact with her captive audience, Haruka understood that her would-be 
partner knew that she was amongst the crowd. She would come for her. 
Soon.

&quot;That girl is Kaioh Michiru.&quot;

&quot;She doesn&#39;t seem like a junior high girl. She must be very popular at 
school.&quot;

Haruka detected a conversation behind her and stirred her drink 
restlessly as she tried to ignore their rudeness. She eyed a lonely 
piano on the stage and felt drawn to it. The blonde&#39;s brow frowned. She 
hadn&#39;t touched the keys of a piano in years... was it the piano which 
called to her, or Michiru&#39;s infuriatingly beautiful music which spoke to 
her soul?

flashback

Her wake up call came in the form of slow, melancholic notes 
persuasively seduced from a violin. Haruka sighed softly and turned over 
groggily, still in the space between dreams and wakefulness. Grabbing at 
the comforter next to her, she was met with emptiness where she had 
expected to find her lover.

&quot;Michiru.&quot; She whispered. Sitting upright, she fought the pull of sleep.

The pull of her partner&#39;s instrument was stronger. &#39;She&#39;s calling me.&#39; 
Haruka realized.

Readjusting her boxers and tank top, Haruka padded across the stone 
floor of her room and out through the open balcony. Tiptoeing past the 
piano, she trailed her fingers across its smooth surface, remembering 
her confession to Michiru not long ago. The predawn light cast a gray 
hue across the atmosphere of the moon as the cool morning air nipped at 
her warm skin. The mists were damp and chilly as she followed the path 
of music left by her lover.

When Haruka finally found her, she had to pause at Michiru&#39;s beauty. 
Wearing nothing but one of Haruka&#39;s long shirts, the aqua haired woman 
stood with her back to her, her cobalt eyes closed as she faced the 
white mountains in the distance, the fog rolling down from its peaks as 
Michiru obliviously continued her sonata. Haruka stared on dumbly.

The sun was trying to pierce the fogs as it crested the tops of the 
mountains on the horizon when Haruka broke free of her trance. The wind 
enabling her to remain undetected, she crept behind Michiru, gently 
lacing her arms around the smaller woman&#39;s waist.

Michiru&#39;s cobalt eyes jolted open and her frame shook slightly from 
surprise, but her music never faltered. &quot;Haruka, what-&quot;, she barely 
managed.

Haruka smiled knowingly, tightening her hold around her lover. &quot;You tell 
me, you&#39;re the one who called me out here.&quot;

A smiled tugged at Michiru&#39;s mouth as Haruka&#39;s lips found the curve of 
her neck, exposed by her form required to play the violin. She quickly, 
yet flawlessly brought her song to an early close before turning in the 
strong arms that had captured her to face her lover.

/flashback

&#39;Again.&#39; Haruka thought angrily at the memories of her past life that 
hounded her. No matter how far she ran, they would always find her. 
Though part of her wanted to embrace the tender emotions the memory had 
heralded, another part of her desperately wanted to push them away.

Feeling a level gaze on her, Haruka&#39;s eyes darted back to the stage. She 
was met with a pair of cobalt eyes. The blonde swallowed audibly and 
quickly diverted her gaze, taking a sip of the bitter orange liquid in 
her glass, too diluted by melting ice cubes. Nothing would have been 
strong enough to dilute the memories which plagued her.

&quot;I heard she doesn&#39;t make many friends.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s hazel eyes narrowed as the rumor mill began behind her again. 
Being at the center of rumors herself, gossip bothered her. But what 
bothered her more were those stuffy, middle aged sponsors who spoke like 
they knew her Michiru.

&#39;My Michiru?&#39; Haruka asked herself, immediately pushing away the wave of 
sudden protectiveness that had surged over her.

&quot;I heard she doesn&#39;t make many friends.&quot;

&quot;Why is that? She seems very nice.&quot;

&quot;They say she dislikes people.&quot;

Haruka couldn&#39;t help but listen to their words. It seemed that Michiru 
and herself had much in common socially, but the thought struck her as 
odd. She remembered the Michiru of her past life as more friendly, 
always in tune to other&#39;s emotions. Yet in this life, she seemed less 
social, more subdued...

&#39;Am I holding her back by not being by her side?&#39;

Haruka snorted as her anger flared. Nonsense. It was all nonsense.

A brilliant crescendo of Michiru&#39;s violin captured the audience as 
Haruka stood from her seat and spun on the gossipy couple behind her. 
She eyed them dangerously, blaming them for making her think such 
thoughts. Their mouths clicked shut audibly and Haruka stormed away, 
needing an escape.

Yet the hazel eyed woman didn&#39;t notice that a pair of cobalt eyes 
followed her departure and that her own lips mouthed Michiru&#39;s name 
breathlessly.

----------

Michiru took a bow to the subdued yet awed clapping of the audience. She 
quickly retreated backstage, her heart in her throat as she placed her 
violin in its case quickly. Utilizing the service exit, she took off in 
the direction Haruka had retreated. Her eyes wide, her breath panting, 
she dashed forward blindly.

The long, narrow hallway emptied into a deserted stairwell and for all 
the fear and urgency Michiru felt, when she found herself looking up at 
Haruka, who stood several steps above her as she inspected one of her 
paintings, she somehow managed to regain her composure. How fitting that 
she would find her in front of her depiction of &#39;the End of the World&#39;, 
a painting she had composed after her first dream of the silence. She 
wondered if Haruka would be able to interpret the hidden message it 
harbored.

The blonde inspected the painting before her critically, understanding 
its deadly message instantly. A shiver ran down her spine as she felt 
the terror encapsulated in the image. The silence had manifested in her 
dreams as a vortex of wind and heat. Had Michiru&#39;s manifested as 
freezing waves of impending doom? There was no doubt that her would-be 
partner had been the artist. Just as she had, ages ago, with her music, 
Michiru was searching for her through this painting.

&quot;How do you like it?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s voice shattered the silence, and although the other woman 
remained calm, she could sense Haruka&#39;s shock at being interrupted. When 
hazel eyes turned to hers of cobalt, Michiru sensed that the other woman 
felt trapped. The aqua haired girl did her best to reign herself in, to 
not push her reluctant lover of the Silver Millennium too far as she had 
once, long ago.

&quot;You are more than welcome here, genius racer Tenoh Haruka.&quot; Michiru 
tried to level the playing field, ease Haruka&#39;s sense of entrapment.

&quot;You know a lot about me, don&#39;t you?&quot; An easy smile found Haruka&#39;s lips 
as she struggled to maintain her flippant indifference in the face of 
the woman she both liked and loathed. Inside, she was shaking as she 
pretended not to comprehend the woman across from her or the message in 
her painting. &quot;Did you paint this?&quot;

Michiru cocked an eyebrow, knowing that the blonde had sensed that the 
painting was hers the moment she had laid eyes on it and that she had 
also both understood and subsequently refused the painting&#39;s message. 
Michiru decided to try another tactic, she could change subjects just as 
easily. Their game of aversion was becoming a choreographed dance.

&quot;You&#39;re famous, aren&#39;t you? In my school, there&#39;s lots of your fandom. 
One of them wants to ride along the coastline in your car, even though 
she&#39;s a girl!&quot; A flip of Michiru&#39;s hair thinly veiled her admiration for 
the other woman as she tested the waters, feeling somewhat vulnerable 
knowing she was talking about herself.

Haruka smirked. This girl knew her gender. &#39;But she still pursues me...&#39; 
She pushed away her thoughts as her attention returned to the painting 
in front of her. Try as she might, she couldn&#39;t ignore the message 
Michiru had left in it.

&quot;The end of the world... how can such a pretty girl who wouldn&#39;t even 
hurt a fly paint such a horrible imaginary picture?&quot; She asked 
detachedly.

Michiru snapped, aqua eyebrows meeting dangerously, a frown marring her 
features. Her voice became accusatory. &quot;It is not imaginary! I can see 
it clearly, as can you!&quot; She almost backpedaled as she realized with 
dismay that she had once again placed Haruka on the defensive. She had 
pushed too far. She had repeated history.

Hazel eyes darkened threateningly as Haruka retreated to her fallback 
excuse, using her refusal of her destiny and duty as a crutch. 
&quot;Ridiculous! I&#39;m Japan&#39;s first ever junior racer, Tenoh Haruka! Neither 
the memory of my previous life nor the end of the world is my business!&quot;

Haruka almost faltered at having revealed to Michiru her knowledge of 
her past existence, of the knowledge of that which she ran from. She had 
to fight herself not to avert her eyes from the irresistible woman who 
wouldn&#39;t stop pursuing her. The tension mounted as the two glared evenly 
at each other.

&quot;If it has to be done, why don&#39;t you do it?&quot; Haruka&#39;s fingers closed 
into fists, her knuckles turning white as she continued to run, every 
single word that came from her mouth the manifestation of both the utter 
truth and a complete lie, the product of her warring emotions. &quot;I don&#39;t 
want you snooping around me anymore!&quot;

The damage already done, Michiru felt helpless. It was too late. Her 
emotions frayed, she lost her tightly laced control on the situation. 
&quot;Stop talking that way! I have a dream to be a violinist! I can&#39;t keep 
on doing stupid things like saving the world from ruin!&quot;

Her words were lies, but as Haruka turned and retreated stormily, she 
would have said or done anything to make her would-be partner return to 
her side.

----------

The night was as warm as her elegant cocktail dress suggested, yet the 
aqua haired woman held her bare arms across her chest for warmth against 
a phantom chill.

History had repeated itself at her own hands.

Once again she had allowed her raw emotions to control her and she had 
pushed a tentative Haruka to the point of running away.

She had run from her.

Michiru sighed as her cobalt eyes found the churning ocean beneath her 
where the restless waters complimented her mood as she stood alone on 
the stern of the yacht. Night had long since fallen and the moon cast 
its reflection across the ocean largely. She could hear the sponsors 
milling about on the deck above, eating their expensive dinners and 
speaking of inconsequential topics while she, a mere fifteen year old 
girl, held the weight of the world on her shoulders below them.

Her cobalt eyes narrowed in frustration. Perhaps, in this life, she was 
destined to bear that weight on her own, without a partner. A single 
tear slid down the curve of Michiru&#39;s cheek. Haruka herself had claimed 
to have rejected her past life and her obligation to duty. She had 
failed to help Haruka understand that destiny and duty were not the 
same, and that neither would bring her hardship as she so obviously 
believed.

Haruka had rejected her.

The slight girl considered the implications. Perhaps in this life, 
Haruka wasn&#39;t meant for the role she had fulfilled in her last. The 
stubborn woman certainly didn&#39;t want it. Michiru had given up her dreams 
of the future. Her ideals of becoming a prominent violinist and artist 
had paled once being called to duty to protect the Earth from demise 
once she had remembered her destiny to be reunited with Haruka. But 
Haruka hadn&#39;t. Haruka wanted her fame and glory, had refused to believe 
that she was to play any part in a future she wanted no part of.

Michiru began to doubt her hope that any traces of the warm lover she 
had remembered from centuries past still existed inside her would-be 
partner. Instead, it seemed that the cold, scared woman that Uranus had 
become eight hundred years ago was all that was left alive in the Haruka 
of the present. And if Michiru were to push her further, she feared the 
result would yield her no change. Further pursuit of her rogue partner 
would only succeed to scare Haruka further, to ruin the young champion&#39;s 
chances of pursuing the future that she had chosen.

A future without her.

Michiru looked deep within herself and came to a saddening conclusion. 
Ever since she had realized that Tenoh Haruka was the reincarnation of 
her lover from her past life, she had given Haruka nothing but heartache 
once pursuing her. The bitter blonde had made it more than obvious that 
she wanted no part of Michiru, Sailor Neptune, or the future they were 
meant to share.

Haruka had refused her.

Michiru hung her head sadly. A gentle wind swept up from the ocean&#39;s 
stormy surface and caressed her aqua hair. She could almost believe it 
was pleading with her not to give up. She shook her head resolutely.

&quot;If you love something, you will set it free.&quot; Her voice a mere whisper, 
her heart simply cried.

Even in her desperation, Michiru realized that she would rather face the 
pain and hardship of facing her duty alone and foregoing her destiny 
with Haruka than to try to force the woman she loved into doing 
something that she refused to do. She would spare her would be lover 
from that which she had refused, she would content herself with loving 
the memory of Haruka from afar.

She frowned. She would never be content. But she would grant Haruka her 
wish and leave her in peace.

The ocean was upset with her decision. It churned beneath her, rising 
into swells and slamming into the side of the yacht in anger. Several 
patrons on the deck above glanced over the railing, wondering what had 
caused the uneasiness of the seas. Below them, the night&#39;s most revered 
performer collapsed into tears.

Preview, Chapter 10:

In her exhaustion from battle, Neptune&#39;s power drained from her body 
like sand through her fingers. A quiet half-chuckle, half-sob escaped 
Michiru&#39;s lips as she was left kneeling in the deserted construction 
site. Even the powerful ripple that charged the atmosphere and heralded 
the arrival of an ally couldn&#39;t hope to raise her spirits.

&quot;You&#39;re a bit late.&quot; Michiru said, bitterness lacing her voice as she 
met her friend&#39;s garnet gaze. &quot;You usually show up when I need you the 
most.&quot;

Pluto frowned at her hopeless friend, caught off guard by the 
frustration in the small woman&#39;s voice. &quot;That&#39;s precisely why I&#39;m here 
right now.&quot;</pre>
