<h1>Kazeko (part 5 of 20)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/kazeko-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Rei, lost in her own lonely thoughts, never noticed when she passed by 
the Crown Arcade.  After all, she passed it every day either when 
heading home or when she met her friends for a snack.  Heading home from 
her visit to the nearby bookstore in an unsuccessful attempt to find a 
new book on astrology she had heard about, Rei wasn&#39;t paying that much 
attention to the people in the window of the diner until her mind 
registered who she had seen.  She stopped still, the pedestrian behind 
her swerving just in time to avoid hitting her, her mind trying 
desperately to process the scene.  She turned around, eyes flying to the 
window, and she gasped.
 
&quot;Ami-chan . . . Mako-chan . . .&quot;
 
Makoto and Ami were sitting in the customary senshi booth, sipping their 
drinks, no books in front of Ami (which was very strange), just staring 
at each other.  Every now and then, one of them would smile or laugh, 
then the other would, then they&#39;d just stare some more.
 
The silence said it all.
 
Rei could sense the love binding her friends, even without her psychic 
abilities, and she felt her heart twinge.  She felt a warmth on her 
cheeks, and she reached up, her eyes straying away from the pair in the 
window.  Tears.  Rei fell against the side of the building utterly 
silent, as tears ran down her cheeks.  She had never felt such a painful 
loneliness fill her, and she wondered why seeing her friends together 
made her cry.
 
&quot;Rei-san?&quot;
 
Rei looked up as Setsuna knelt beside her, and the Senshi of time 
recoiled from the pain in her young friend&#39;s gray-purple eyes.  
Something in those depths reminded Setsuna of the fire in the young 
Princess of Mars just before the end of the Silver Millennium.  &quot;Why?  I 
was happy once, Setsuna-san.  I remember being happy.  But it was so 
long ago and it&#39;s fuzzy and I don&#39;t remember who.  Why does seeing 
Mako-chan and Ami-chan together make me sad?  I should be happy; I want 
to be happy again.&quot;
 
Setsuna looked up into the window and a strange smile spread across her 
face.  &quot;I wondered if they would ever get back together again.  They&#39;ve 
been very close friends for a very long time.&quot;
 
&quot;Back together?&quot;  Rei looked up, her voice a soft whispered hinting at 
something much darker underneath.  Setsuna remembered that darkness, 
too.  &quot;They . . . they were lovers in the Silver Millennium?&quot;
 
&quot;You all had lovers.  You don&#39;t think you senshi could be the guardians 
of love and justice if you never experienced love, do you?&quot;
 
Rei shook her head, angrily wiping away her tears.  She was getting more 
and more angry with every word that came out of Setsuna&#39;s mouth, sensing 
a truth abut the Senshi of Time she had never suspected.  &quot;But Serenity 
and Endymion remember their love.  Why wouldn&#39;t we?&quot;
 
&quot;Their love was destiny, Rei-san.&quot;
 
&quot;And mine wasn&#39;t?  I didn&#39;t find my soulmate?  I don&#39;t deserve to 
remember being happy?  I don&#39;t deserve to be with my lover ever again?  
I think you should explain yourself!  Now!  What about Haruka-san and 
Michiru-san?&quot;
 
Setsuna couldn&#39;t help but smile at the memory of two rebellious 
princesses, never sensing the trap she was falling into.  &quot;Oh, yes.  
They were lovers back then.  We had so much trouble trying to keep them 
apart; eventually we gave up.&quot;
 
&quot;And they remembered it.&quot;
 
Setsuna, never expecting a trick from the miko, quickly answered the 
question.  Later she would berate herself for letting her guard down 
around the younger senshi; she was getting far too old for mind games.  
&quot;Yes, because they were destined, too.  Serenity and Endymion were meant 
to one day have Small Lady, and Michiru-san and Haruka-san already . . 
.&quot;  She trailed off, staring into two very powerful and calculating 
lavender eyes.
 
&quot;Do Haruka-san and Michiru-san also have a child?  Is that why they 
remember and we do not?&quot;
 
Setsuna flinched, shying away from the most direct answer, finally 
realizing that path Rei was trying to lead her down.  It was a path she 
could not take.  &quot;They do not remember everything.  None of you do, 
except Hotaru-chan.  She&#39;s been reborn so many times that I couldn&#39;t . . 
.&quot;
 
&quot;Again with the trailing off, Setsuna-san,&quot; Rei whispered, her soft 
voice very, very dangerous.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you tell me what happened back 
then?&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s against the rules,&quot; she murmured unconvincingly.
 
&quot;Why don&#39;t you break them?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t break the rules.&quot;
 
&quot;Why not?&quot;
 
&quot;I just don&#39;t, okay?  Not anymore.&quot;
 
&quot;Are you the one that&#39;s keeping us from regaining our memories of the 
Silver Millennium?  Is that one of those rules you won&#39;t break, 
releasing our memories?  You would do this to your friends?  You would 
do this to your fellow senshi?  You would do this to your princess, the 
only daughter of your dead Queen Serenity?&quot;
 
The last words hurt the most, but not for a reason that Rei could ever 
fathom.  Setsuna shot to her feet, dark tears in her red eyes.  &quot;I would 
never do anything to hurt Usagi!  She means more to me than . . . than 
you could ever understand!  You and the younger senshi don&#39;t love her 
half as much as I do&#151;you couldn&#39;t!  You don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking 
about!&quot; she cried, almost running away from the younger senshi.  Rei 
watched her go, wondering what else the Senshi of Time was hiding.
 
Mars stood back up, straitening her clothes, looked at the diner, and 
smiled.  Ami and Makoto were always glad to see their friends, and even 
their impromptu date would not make them chase her away.  Her mind made 
up, Rei entered the familiar diner.</pre>
