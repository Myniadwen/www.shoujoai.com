<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 11 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        A blur of motion, then...

        CLACK!

        ... with a sound very like a clap of thunder the wooden 
practice blades came together, then they slid apart. Makoto leaned 
forward nervously in her seat as she watched from the sidelines 
while the two figures dressed in protective gear fought. One of them 
was taller, heavily muscled, the other small and slim, but they 
still seemed fairly evenly matched.

        Back and forth they went, the slim figure dodging as often 
as she parried his blows. Makoto&#39;s eyes widened, the tall brown 
haired woman watching from the audience as the match 
progressed. &#39;She&#39;s wearing him down,&#39; she realized.

        Finally the smaller figure moved in against the slower, now 
tired figure, in a blur of motion scoring the final points to win 
the match. There was a extended moment of stunned silence in the 
hall, then a round of vigorous applause. The taller man pulled off 
his helm and then offered his hand, &quot;I&#39;m very impressed, young lady.&quot;

        Usagi pulled her own protective helmet off, her long blonde 
hair falling down her back in a braid. &quot;Thank you, sensei,&quot; she 
bowed gravely.

        &quot;Congratulations,&quot; Makoto gave Usagi a little smile as the 
girl walked by her on her way towards the showers.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; and Usagi flashed a smile.

        &quot;I&#39;ve been watching you do that for over a week now, but I 
still get pretty nervous when you do that,&quot; Makoto quietly noted as 
they walked away from the school later on that afternoon. She gave 
Usagi a curious look, &quot;And why did the crowd seem so surprised that 
you won?&quot;

        &quot;That was the district kendo champ,&quot; Usagi shrugged slightly.

        &quot;Wow,&quot; Makoto gave Usagi a surprised glance, &quot;then maybe you 
should enter those championships next time?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m just doing this to help me fight against the youma,&quot; 
Usagi shifted the sword case that she carried over her shoulder.

        &quot;Oh, really?&quot; Makoto gave her a look.

        A faint blush colored Usagi&#39;s pale cheeks, her long blonde 
hair flowing behind her. &quot;Well, it is fun,&quot; she softly admitted.

        They passed by a low stone wall, and Luna jumped down from 
the top, the little black cat agilely clambering her way over to sit 
on Usagi&#39;s shoulder. &quot;The others are waiting for you over at the 
shrine,&quot; she reported.

        &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Makoto asked, surprised.

        &quot;Ami may have made a breakthrough,&quot; Luna reported eagerly.

        Usagi&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly, her voice showing a 
dangerous eagerness. &quot;Then it&#39;s finally time to move?&quot; she asked 
softly.

        &quot;Let&#39;s see what Ami has to say, first,&quot; Makoto quickly 
cautioned her. She didn&#39;t want to see her friend get her hopes up 
too much.

        Usagi puffed out a breath, &quot;You&#39;re right, of course.&quot;

        Makoto smiled suddenly. &quot;Not that I&#39;m not looking forward to 
a rematch with that pasty faced Nephrite,&quot; she added cheerfully

        Luna groaned softly, &quot;You two..&quot;

        Usagi reached up to scratch behind the little cat&#39;s 
ears, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Luna. I promise that I won&#39;t do anything too 
rash.&quot;

        The two of them reached the shrine quickly, walking up the 
long flight of steps to the buildings themselves. They went across 
the courtyard, then Rei&#39;s grandfather emerged from the 
shadows. &quot;They&#39;re waiting inside,&quot; he smiled.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Makoto bowed slightly, and they continued on.

        The room they entered was spacious, a large table sitting at 
the center. A few bowls of snacks waited untouched, as well as a pot 
of tea. Rei came from her room, dressed in the red and white of a 
traditional shrine maiden, &quot;About time you got here.&quot;

        &quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi gave her a crisp nod. Eagerly she 
asked, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

        Rei shook her head, her long black hair flowing around her 
as she said, &quot;Ami hasn&#39;t told me anything yet, either.&quot; She gave 
Luna a welcoming smile as she put the saucer and bottle of milk 
down, &quot;Care for a drink?&quot;

        &quot;Why, thank you,&quot; Luna jumped down from Usagi&#39;s shoulder 
onto the table as Rei poured out the milk, drinking eagerly.

        &quot;Sorry for the wait,&quot; Ami walked in a few moments later, 
wearing much more casual garb than her usual professor clothes. A 
white shirt, blue pants and a comfortable vest made up her outfit, 
and she was carrying that large shoulder bag with her again.

        Usagi just had to smile slightly at the way Makoto seemed to 
light up when ever she met the professor. Of course, Ami seemed to 
gain almost as much pleasure from being around Makoto. &quot;It&#39;s good to 
see you,&quot; Makoto murmured softly.

        A faint blush appeared on the blue haired woman&#39;s cheeks as 
she answered, &quot;I&#39;m glad that you.. I mean all of you came so 
quickly.&quot;

        &quot;Hello, Ami,&quot; Usagi gave her a slight smile before 
dispensing with the pleasantries to ask, &quot;What is going on?&quot;

        &quot;Not that I mind the suspense,&quot; Rei said, her eyes flashing 
with sudden anger, &quot;but it gets a bit much at times.&quot;

        Makoto was about to speak up in her defense when Ami shook 
her head slightly. &quot;Sorry, but I wanted to be sure before I said 
anything,&quot; she quietly explained, &quot;but I think I&#39;ve found their 
nexus, the location in Tokyo the Negaverse uses to teleport through.&quot;

        A long moment of dead silence, then Usagi cheered, &quot;YES!&quot; 
Bouncing to her feet she threw her arms around the startled Ami, 
spinning her around, &quot;Thank you!&quot;

        &quot;Hey, wait a moment..&quot; Ami blushed fiercely, struggling a 
bit in Usagi&#39;s grip.

        Rei hesitated, feeling so many emotions running through her. 
On one hand she felt relief that they finally knew where the enemy 
was, but she was also just a bit scared. This meant that the next 
battle was coming, and she had no idea what sort of odds they might 
be facing down there. Or what they might have to do to win..

        &quot;Nice job,&quot; Makoto was a bit more low-key, but the sunny 
smile that she gave Ami more than made up for it. &quot;Are there any 
downsides?&quot; she asked thoughtfully.

        &quot;That&#39;s the major question,&quot; Ami agreed. &quot;The nexus is 
beneath a normal enough seeming arcade, but what sort of defenses 
they might have are unknown.&quot;

        &quot;Luna?&quot; Usagi asked the little black cat softly.

        Luna looked up from where she was cleaning the milk off of 
her whiskers. &quot;They won&#39;t leave it unguarded,&quot; she said, &quot;but I 
can&#39;t say what the exact nature of the force there is.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s quite a few youma in there,&quot; the quiet voice 
surprised them all, &quot;I tried to get in there on my own and failed.&quot; 
Sailor V stood in the open doorway, the white mask covering her 
eyes, the girl&#39;s sailor fuku blowing gently in the breeze.

        &quot;I was almost expecting you to turn up,&quot; Usagi said calmly, 
looking over at the masked blonde. There was a bit of anger in her 
voice as she asked, &quot;If you knew where this nexus was, why didn&#39;t 
you just tell us?&quot;

        &quot;She didn&#39;t know,&quot; Artemis spoke up, the white cat crouched 
on her shoulder. &quot;She was pulled along in an enemy&#39;s teleport, and 
had to leave the same way.&quot;

        &quot;Artemis.&quot; Luna growled out, and the little white cat 
flinched.

        &quot;So why are you here now?&quot; Makoto asked as she carefully 
moved herself between where Sailor V was standing and Ami, just in 
case.

        &quot;I&#39;m here to help,&quot; Sailor V said to them calmly, &quot;if you&#39;ll 
let me.&quot;

        Rei narrowed her eyes, while both Makoto and Ami looked 
towards Usagi. The slim blonde studied Sailor V for a moment, almost 
as if she was trying to see past the mask. &quot;I don&#39;t trust you,&quot; she 
finally said, &quot;you&#39;re far too mysterious.&quot; As Sailor V was turning 
to leave Usagi added, &quot;But that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t need your 
help.&quot;

        Rei got up from her sitting position, the others following 
suit. &quot;So we&#39;re going in there?&quot; she asked, meeting Usagi&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;We&#39;re going in,&quot; Usagi agreed firmly.
