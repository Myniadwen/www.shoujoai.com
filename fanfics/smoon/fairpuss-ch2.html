<h1>The Tale of the Fair Ogress and the Puss in Boots (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/fade.html">Fade</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fairpuss-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>A.N: To clarify, Chibi-Usa is ten years old, Hotaru&#146;s twelve, the Inners 
are twenty-four. Fiore, Endymion, Michiru and Harucka are twenty-seven. 
Setsuna and Serenity refused to tell me how old they were, explaining me 
that a lady should NOT be asked these kinds of things, to which I 
readily agreed since I wanted to stay alive... NO! Not the ruler on the 
fingers! Ow!!! TT

Wolves don&#146;t hide in the woods... It&#146;s full of bugs!

From a high window, the executioner watched with emotionless eyes the 
ogress and the servant hurrying on their quest. She didn&#146;t turn around 
as she said &#147;They must be stopped. I don&#146;t care how, but do it quickly. 
You have carte blanche.&#148;

The tall humanoid behind her smirked, executed an elaborate salute with 
their hat and left, making their cape swirl stylishly behind them.

Then, the executioner left the room too, walked down a steep, endless 
staircase, stopped in the kitchen, grabbed a tray of food, came out in 
the open inner court and headed to the massive dungeon. She took the 
time to look up at the impossibly high tower before entering it and 
climbing the spiralling stairs, all the while wondering why princesses 
always had to be locked up at the top of dungeons. She hoped apparently 
randomly, avoiding some steps, bent sometimes to avoid cutting rays of 
light, seemed to disappear in the shadows at some point only to reappear 
higher on the stairs, seemingly out of nowhere. At least, she was the 
one who had been put in charge to booby trap the building. She knew all 
of them... Finally, she reached the top floor and opened a 
metal-reinforced wooden door that wasn&#146;t even locked...

She looked the room over. It was where the daughter&#146;s prince was held 
prisoner by the cardinal. The prince didn&#146;t even know she was there. He 
didn&#146;t even know he had a daughter anymore... At least, it was quite 
decent. Actually, it was probably the warmest and cosiest place of the 
whole castle since she had taken up the post of executioner, four years 
ago. That was when she had met her only true friend, the princess, for 
the first time. The younger girl had seen right through her hood. The 
little princess had seen the loneliness the dark executioner hid behind 
it and over the time, the two young girls had developed the most 
unlikely friendship. Of course, no one knew about it, least of all the 
cardinal, she had been very careful about that. Anyway, nobody cared to 
come up there. High, trapped dungeons had some advantages, she had to 
admit... Since then, Hotaru had brought candles of all sizes and 
colours, thick carpets, heavy curtains, piles of cushions, 
do-it-yourself furniture. She had even managed to have a fireplace made. 
Of course, the builder had had to be taken care of afterwards, but it 
was worth it. It was chilly up there! She had even spent some of her 
week-ends repainting the bloody and dark walls in white with the help of 
the princess. She smiled at the memory of a pink-haired girl covered 
with white spots, laughing happily.

Speaking of the princess, where was she? Hotaru set the tray on the 
table and crossed the living room and opened the bedroom door. It was 
decorated much in the same way as the previous room. The pink-haired 
girl was leaning against the window. She turned at her friend&#146;s 
entrance. &#147;Is it done?&#148; She asked sadly.

Hotaru just nodded.

&#147;Was it really necessary? This Michiru seemed to be a nice ogress, for 
what you told me. Maybe she could help us. And Donkey Pelt isn&#146;t able to 
stand up without tripping, much less rescuing some princess. And would 
you have really hurt Puu?&#148;

The executioner looked at her sadly. The younger woman was so innocent, 
so compassionate. That was why she had to be strong for her, to be able 
to protect her. &#147;I am sorry, small lady, you know I would never do that. 
But we can&#146;t afford to let them endanger our plans. If this wedding is 
realised, the revolution will never succeed and you will never be 
recognised as the true heir to the throne.&#148;

Chibi-Usa stepped forward and hugged her only friend, burying her head 
in her shoulder. &#147;You know that I don&#146;t care about it... All I want is 
to be free, with you...&#148;

The dark-haired girl hugged her back, tightly. &#147;I know, but it will 
never happen as long as the cardinal Fiore&#146;s alive and have your father 
under his spell. Besides, we already know that Fiore plans to dispose of 
princess Minako if she ever marries your father. We can&#146;t let that 
happen either...&#148;

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Meanwhile, in another part of the castle, the cardinal was having a hard 
time keeping his temper in check. &#147;This wedding will never be!&#148; He 
almost yelled, jealousy dripping from every word. &#147;This castle is mine, 
this kingdom is mine and more importantly, Endymion is MINE!!!&#148;

His only audience, a kneeling woman clad in leather armour shuddered 
upon hearing how venomous his tone was. She sincerely pitied whoever 
would dare to stand in the cardinal&#146;s way.

He walked to his desk, picked up a small leather purse and threw it to 
the mercenary. &#147;You!&#148; He barked. &#147;Take those magic beans. Use them 
wisely for it took me a lot of power to make them. I want the ogress and 
the slave dead! Do I make myself clear?&#148;

She swallowed nervously. &#147;Yes, Milord.&#148;

Fiore walked up to her. He reached out and idly ran his hand through her 
green hair, so much like his. &#147;Succeed, and your reward will be past all 
your hopes...&#148; His hold on her hair tightened and he pulled her roughly 
to her feet to meet his eyes. &#147;... Fail, and death will be too sweet of 
a punishment for you!&#148;

&#147;Yes, Milord!!!&#148; She managed to squeak out and as soon as she was 
released, she all but fled the room.

----------------------------------------------------------------

A few hours later and Michiru had discovered that Donkey Pelt was more 
persistent than concrete and that there was no way she would get rid of 
her. Similarly, trying to avoid any physical contact with the walking 
bacteriological threat was wishful thinking! The girl was the clumsiest 
creature she had ever met. How could a specie produce such a specimen 
and still not be extinct yet? It was as if every root, every stone and 
even her own feet were members of a world machination whose only purpose 
was to make her trip and fall on the poor ogress. Michiru was in dire 
need for a bath. In addition, Donkey Pelt proved to be able to babble 
about anything, relentlessly. Michiru considered herself as a fairly 
sociable, patient and polite ogress but even her had limits. A hell of a 
headache was steadily building up in her poor skull.

And things had considerably worsened when the heel of one of her 
precious stilettos broke.

To sum up, Michiru was about to explode.

&#147;Hum, Miss Michiru? What did Setsuna mean, your heart desire?&#148;

The question caused Michiru to stop so abruptly that Donkey Pelt, who 
was walking just behind her, slammed in her at full speed. They both 
lost their balance and fell forward, rolling down a hill in a tangle of 
limbs and cries of pain and fear.

As she rolled, Michiru noticed that the slope ended up on a cliff. Out 
of instinct, she grabbed the other girl and as they were launched in the 
air, she threw Donkey Pelt back on the hill with all her strength, and 
then braced herself for her fatal fall...

... Only to splash down in a filthy marsh a few meters lower.

A stupefied silence fell on the woods. Without a word, the young ogress 
covered in mud and aquatic plants slowly stood up. She uselessly dusted 
herself, walked back up to where the servant was still sitting, the eyes 
of the donkey head still spiralling. When the probably human girl 
recovered, she jumped in fear when she saw Michiru towering above her. 
&#147;Ack! The swamp monster!!!&#148; She yelled, trying frantically to stand up 
to run away.

Michiru grabbed her by the collar and brought her to her face. &#147;Donkey 
Pelt! Enough of your silliness!!! It&#146;s me, Michiru!&#148;

The young human calmed down instantaneously. Michiru saw a bright smile 
flash under the horrendous pelt. &#147;Michiru! You saved my life! I owe you 
my life in return! I&#146;ll follow you everywhere until I can pay you 
back!!!&#148; And she glomped the ogress in a bone-crashing hug.

Michiru wanted to groan.

Michiru wanted to cry.

Michiru wanted to deny everything.

&#147;Say, Michiru, why are you covered in mud? Did you have a skin beauty 
treatment?&#148; Donkey Pelt asked cheerfully.

That was when Michiru realised that everything she wanted was 
irrelevant. She gently lowered the smaller girl and with as much dignity 
as she could muster given the circumstances, she asked, very slowly. 
&#147;Donkey Pelt, do you know of any clean inn with a well-equipped bathroom 
and nice, bug-free beds anywhere near here?&#148;

&#147;Sure, there&#146;s one not too far from here in Juuban Town. That&#146;s the best 
in the whole kingdom!&#148; Eyes sparkled. &#147;Great food too!&#148;

&#147;Let&#146;s get there, then...&#148;

Concealed by the vegetation, the slitted dark blue eyes of a predator 
thoroughly studied them, lingering on the ogress&#146;s heavenly built figure 
in particular.

A.N: No, Hotaru and Chibi-Usa are not sexually involved with each other, 
even though they do share deep feelings. Maybe later, when they are 
older.</pre>
