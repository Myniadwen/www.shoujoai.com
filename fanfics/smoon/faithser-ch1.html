<h1>Faith in Serenity</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/monikku.html">Monikku</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s notes: This is not a stand-alone story. I am relying on the 
readers&#39; expected knowledge of the characters&#39; appearances and general 
dispositions. This fic is a reflection of Mizuno Ami&#39;s thoughts upon meeting 
Makoto/Jupiter in episode 25 (although, her personality is a mix of Ami in 
the manga and anime). Creative license was taken. :points to the sign: Thank 
you for not flaming me.

Having said that, on with the show...

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rei-chan and I entered the Crown Game Center looking for Usagi-chan. It was 
customary for Usagi-chan to waste much of her afternoons there. I understood 
the desire to relieve the stresses of life. Between school and senshi 
business, our lives were very hectic. I, however, never quite understood 
Usagi-chan, I still don&#39;t. Afterall, the best relief of stress is to finish 
your duties!

In a bit of a daze, I sensed Rei-chan stop abruptly. Brushing against her, I 
felt her arm tense up. As I swiveled my head forward, I saw the source of 
Rei-chan&#39;s surprise. My eyes widened at the sight.

The amazon girl! ...With Usagi-chan??

I had never been one to take heart to rumours, but as I looked at her... the 
sheer size of her, the relentlessness of her undaunting, fearless gaze... I 
realised the gossip was true. It left me wondering what other rumours might 
have been correct.

Usagi-chan is too trusting, Rei-chan had always said that. What was she 
doing with such a stranger? With someone so well known for a violent temper?

Completely lost in my thoughts, confirming accusations, I never noticed the 
introductions made. I never noticed the large girl inching towards me, 
bending down to eye level with me... until she was right in my face.

The fear took root inside my belly. That feral, intimidating girl, less than 
a foot away...

Smiling brightly and giggling?

It took a moment to register that she was petting Luna. It took even less 
than that for my cheeks to flush. I had been an utter fool.

She was luminescent, caressing Luna with a careful touch. Surely that 
glowing face, full of affection... that sweet, gentle girl... could not be 
the menacing and hateful wretch everyone said she was. Watching her being so 
playful, so kind...

I let out a wistful sigh, involuntarily, unconsciously.

After realising what I had done, my cheeks then blushed a furiously radiant 
red.

In my heart, a spark was kindled for the beauty behind the fierce &quot;beast.&quot;
