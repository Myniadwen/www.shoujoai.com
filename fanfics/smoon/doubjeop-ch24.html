Mina groaned as consciousness slowly returned to her. The moment she 
opened her eyes, she knew right where she was. She was on a bed roll in 
Ray&#39;s room at the shrine. As she became more awake, she shook her head 
to clear her brain of confusion.

&quot;No. Not Ray&#39;s room. Rei&#39;s room. The shrine was demolished a decade 
ago.&quot; She corrected herself out loud in an attempt to help reorient 
herself.

It looked almost exactly how she remembered her friend&#39;s room looking 
back when they were kids, except it was a little less cluttered. She 
also noticed a tray next to her with breakfast on it. Apparently it must 
have been placed there quite some time ago, because the food was cool to 
the touch.

She sat up and continued to take in her surroundings. No restraints 
holding her down. No one was waiting eagerly to beat answers out of her 
or call her a fool or otherwise demonize her. It was the last thing she 
expected. They had left no one to guard her in any way.

It was almost insulting.

Next to the food was a small piece of paper folded in half. She sat 
cross-legged as she picked it up and started to read.

Mina,

If you happen to wake up, please take a moment to enjoy your meal. So 
far, aside from mumbling in your sleep, you haven&#39;t done much. This is 
disappointing because we are currently short-handed. Your wounds are 
healing well though, so you should be up to more tasks soon.

Here is your cover story, that is of course assuming you don&#39;t decide to 
just up and run away. You are Minako&#39;s twin who has returned from Europe 
because you were badly injured in a car accident and needed to return 
home. You are staying here because there isn&#39;t enough room at your 
&#39;sister&#39;s&#39; home, and you aren&#39;t on good terms with your parents.

Your name is Aino Mineko and you are currently unemployed and thus, 
broke. Grandpa has stated that you are more than welcome to work at the 
shrine until you get on your feet, and even then he has stated that &quot;the 
lovely blonde is more than welcome to stay because another beautiful 
Miko will bring more patrons to our humble shrine&quot;. In short, he has the 
hots for you. So try to stay out of arm&#39;s reach of him and for the 
divine spirit&#39;s sake, don&#39;t encourage him!

I hope you will be staying with us as well. It really would be better 
for all of us. Besides, I could use some help with the chores. If you 
are ready to work, go ahead and borrow one of my Kimono to wear your 
first day and come find me. I&#39;m your boss.

Be afraid.

Rei

She placed the paper next to the cold food, then tossed the blanket 
aside and stood up. Her muscles felt stiff, and as she started to walk 
toward the closet, she found it somewhat difficult to keep her balance.

After only taking a few steps, she tripped over her own feet and found 
her face colliding with a wall.

&quot;Son of a--&quot; she said as she stepped back, rubbing her nose.

Then she found herself tripping again, this time over the food tray Rei 
had kindly left out for her. This sent the tray sliding across the room 
to crash against the wall, and her smacking the back of her skull on the 
wooden floor.

She lay there a moment in stunned silence, her mouth wide open and eyes 
clenched shut as if screaming, but not making a sound. She rolled onto 
her side, holding her head with both hands, and she slowly started to 
curl up into a ball.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot;

A groan was about all Mina could manage. She didn&#39;t know when Rei had 
come in, and at the moment she didn&#39;t care. All she wanted was to be off 
the floor and for the pain to stop. It was only when Rei helped her up 
to a sitting position and wrapped a blanket around her that she realized 
her state of dress. Or rather, lack thereof. Aside from her sling, she 
wore absolutely nothing underneath the blanket.

As soon as her head stopped throbbing enough for her to put to into 
words what she was thinking, she said, &quot;Why in the hell am I nekkid, and 
where in the hell are my clothes?&quot;

Rei shrugged. &quot;It was easier for me to clean your wound as Mizuno Sensei 
instructed if I removed your shirt.&quot; When Mina gave Rei a blank stare, 
she added, &quot;I didn&#39;t violate you or anything, if that&#39;s what you&#39;re 
worried about. It was just a simple sponge bath.&quot;

Just then, they heard Rei&#39;s grandfather as he came around the door 
frame. &quot;Oh, Rei, there you are. I was just . . . looking . . . for . . . 
you.&quot;

His eyes went wide as he looked at &#39;Mineko&#39; covered only in a blanket 
wrapped around her. Blond hair elegantly flowing over her shoulders, 
inviting beautiful blue eyes, the pale smooth skin of her shoulder, . . 
.

As his brain continued to slow, he pointed at Rei, then to himself, then 
over his shoulder. Then with a huge smile on his face, he hobbled off.

Rei shook her head and said, &quot;I&#39;ve also kept him away. Believe me, that 
hasn&#39;t been an easy task. I haven&#39;t accomplished anything this morning 
because of him trying to sneak a peak. So mostly because of him, I&#39;ll 
need your help to catch up with what needs to be done for the day.&quot; Then 
she got up and headed over to the closet to get Mina a Miko outfit to 
wear.

Mina watched Rei&#39;s back as the other woman rummaged through the closet 
for a few moments, then said, &quot;So, did you happen to sneak a peak too, 
Rei? I mean, ya know, while you were giving me a sponge bath and all. 
I&#39;d have loved to have been awake during --&quot;

She stopped talking when the kimono Rei had retrieved for her suddenly 
shot across the room and smacked her in the face, followed by Rei 
grumbling at her to get moving.

The last time Ami was summoned to Principal Takahashi&#39;s office, it had 
been for a minor complaint from one of her students&#39; parents. It had 
ended well, with her actually being praised.

This time, Ami was told to come here even though it interrupted her last 
class. She was made to stand in the hallway and wait while the 
principal, vice principal, several members of the school board, and 
several teachers argued over the fate of her career. After a while, she 
heard what she thought was someone throwing something against the wall 
followed by more muted yelling from behind the closed door.

She had the distinct impression that this wasn&#39;t going to end as well as 
last time.

As Ami stood quietly, she came to the conclusion that the waiting was 
the worst part. It gave one far too much time to think.

This morning on her way in, she was able to see a huge tarp covering 
where she had blown the side of the school open during her fight with 
the Sekkou, and passed several construction workers busily getting their 
tools out as she walked past the room. As if that wasn&#39;t enough, she 
received several glances from some of the teachers and students on her 
way to her first class, which told her word had already gone around that 
she was in some kind of trouble.

Throughout the day, she overheard hushed whispers from several students 
debating different things they had heard from different teachers. None 
of what she heard was particularly reassuring.

The teachers who respected her gave her vague words of encouragement and 
sympathy. It did little to help her, though. By the same token, several 
teachers who didn&#39;t like her for one reason or another either shot her a 
smug grin, or pretended not to notice her. One teacher outright insulted 
her when she thought Ami couldn&#39;t hear her.

When Ami cleared her throat to get the other teacher&#39;s attention, the 
woman made no attempt to apologize for calling her a dyke, nor any of 
the other crude comments she had made. In fact, she went a step further 
and said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s true, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Ami sighed at her own thoughts about the day. All of it pointed toward 
one thing in her mind.

It was all over.

Well, except the shouting anyway. The dull roar in the next room was 
enough to remind her of that. It was just a question of whether or not 
she was going to have her license stripped away from her at this point. 
She just wished they would call her in and get it over with.

Rei, her grandfather, and Mina were all cleaning up after a wedding that 
had just finished up. Despite Mina still only being able to use one 
hand, she was proving to be useful in speeding up the process . . . 
unlike Rei&#39;s grandfather.

Rei&#39;s grandfather asked in his usual cheerful way, &quot;Mineko dear, could 
you hand me that box over there, please? I&#39;m such an old man, you see, 
so it would be safer for you to lift it.&quot; As Mina bent over to pick up 
the box, Rei&#39;s grandfather&#39;s eyes opened just a little more as he tried 
to peer down the front of her kimono.

Just when he was starting to think he could see something, Rei grabbed 
one of his ears between two of her fingers. Ignoring his scream of pain, 
Rei said, &quot;Will you knock it off?&quot; Then, pointing at Mina, she yelled, 
&quot;And you! I told you not to encourage him! What are you trying to do 
anyway? Give him a heart attack?&quot;

Mina walked over, being sure to sway her hips in an exaggerated way, as 
she said, &quot;Oh, Rei-chan, you are so mean to your poor old grandfather.&quot; 
She knelt down behind him and pulled Rei&#39;s fingers off his ear. Then, 
much to Rei&#39;s annoyance, she gently caressed his ear while cooing softly 
to him. For added measure, she started rubbing his shoulders.

Pretending she wasn&#39;t doing anything to him in any way, Mina said 
sympathetically, &quot;Poor old man. You must never get time to relax with 
that nagging granddaughter of yours screaming at you all the time.&quot;

Rei&#39;s grandfather nodded in agreement, then let out a loud sigh as a 
happy smile crossed over his face.

Rei threw her broom down on the ground, pointed at her grandfather, and 
said, &quot;That&#39;s it. You. Out. Now.&quot;

&quot;But I--&quot;

&quot;No, now.&quot;

&quot;What about--&quot;

&quot;Get going.&quot;

&quot;I just need to finish--&quot;

&quot;I can get it.&quot;

Rei&#39;s grandfather sighed as his shoulders slumped in resignation. As he 
walked out, Rei heard him grumbling something about hot blonds and dying 
without ever having any &#39;fun&#39; ever again.

Rei glared at Mina, then said angrily, &quot;You need to quit distracting him 
so we can finish work.&quot;

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s just for fun. I&#39;ve only been here such a short time already, 
and I feel like we are the temple&#39;s slaves or something the way you yell 
at us all the time,&quot; Mina said. Then she smiled and added, &quot;Aw, poor 
Rei. Are we just a little jealous? You know. I could be your personal 
slave, Rei. Maybe that&#39;d cheer you up a little.&quot;

Rei completely ignored her comments as she walked out of the room 
herself. Over her shoulder, she said, &quot;When you&#39;re done in here, you can 
come out to the charm booth and help me reorganize it. The junior high 
school lets out soon, so we will need to have it in order in about 
thirty minutes.&quot;

After the door slammed shut, Mina laughed to herself, then said, &quot;This 
is going to be easier than I thought.&quot; She looked at the closed door as 
if she could still see Rei walking down the path.

&quot;Hino Rei, you will be mine.&quot;

Makoto looked at her watch for the tenth time, then got out of the car, 
thinking that perhaps some fresh air would help with her uneasiness. Ami 
was supposed to have been out fifteen minutes ago. So far today, she 
hadn&#39;t heard a word from her, and until now she had taken that to mean 
that Ami&#39;s superiors had decided somehow to miraculously overlook the 
previous morning. Unfortunately, the waiting meant the exact opposite.

Makoto hated to wait.

As Makoto started walking circles around the car, Minako got out and sat 
on the hood, while Usagi rolled down the back window and leaned out. 
They had both decided to come along with Makoto when she came to pick up 
Ami to give their support to their friends.

Minako drummed her fingers on the hood for a moment, then asked Makoto 
as she passed by the second time, &quot;So, how much trouble do you think she 
will be in?&quot;

Makoto answered, &quot;Ami said this morning on the way here that she&#39;ll be 
lucky if they only fire her.&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re not going to put her in jail again are they?&quot; Usagi asked, 
suddenly panicked.

Makoto said, &quot;No, but they may make it so she will never teach again.&quot; 
She stopped pacing and looked at the door for a moment before saying, 
&quot;Somehow, I think that&#39;d be worse for her than a little more time in 
jail.&quot;

As far as Ami could tell, the last of the students had left twenty 
minutes ago. That meant that Makoto was probably waiting out in the 
parking lot, wondering where the devil she was.

Ami was still waiting, and she had finally given up on standing. 
Instead, she had commandeered a chair from a nearby conference room to 
sit in. Both to help calm her nerves and pass the time, she had started 
grading papers from class three. It was a bit awkward since she only had 
a paper back book resting on her knees as a surface to work with, but it 
would be enough.

Without warning, the door opened and people started leaving. A few of 
the school board members glanced at her, and some of the teachers nodded 
as they passed by. None of them said a word as they left.

Principal Takahashi stepped out into the hall, and said, &quot;You may come 
in now, Sensei Mizuno. A decision has been made, and I wish to discuss 
it with you.&quot;

He sat at his usual place behind his desk, and read a few of the notes 
he had taken during the meeting before speaking. Ami noticed only one 
other person who had stayed in the room. Assistant Principal Nakamura, 
the same man who had griped at her the day before, stood quietly beside 
Mr. Takahashi. He glared at her, but didn&#39;t say anything.

It was as if he had stayed behind just to watch the show.

Principal Takahashi glanced at her and said, &quot;Have a seat, Sensei. This 
will only take a moment.&quot;

Ami straightened her posture just a little more at his words, saying, &quot;I 
prefer to stand, sir.&quot; She had decided she would face the news with as 
much honor as she could.

He sighed, then said, &quot;As you wish.&quot; As Mr. Takahashi continued to read, 
he asked absently, &quot;How&#39;s your side, Sensei?&quot;

&quot;My side, sir?&quot; Ami blinked in confusion. What was he talking about? Was 
this some kind of trick question? &quot;. . . It is . . . fine, sir.&quot;

&quot;Good to hear.&quot;

As if he couldn&#39;t stand the wait any more, Nakamura&#39;s asked coolly, &quot;We 
assume you know why you are here, Sensei?&quot;

Ami bowed politely as she said, &quot;Yes sir.&quot; She noticed her knees shaking 
just a bit as she straightened back up and hoped it wasn&#39;t noticeable to 
either of the two men before her.

The Assistant Principal narrowed his eyes as he glared at her. &quot;Then say 
something in your defense, you poor disgrace for a--&quot;

Principal Nakamura interrupted him after raising his eyebrows slightly 
while still reading, saying, &quot;You may leave now, Yukichi. Your presence 
here is no longer required.&quot;

&quot;But sir, I--&quot;

This time, the principal slammed his notes on the desk and yelled, &quot;I 
said, get out!&quot;

Without another word, he headed for the door. He stopped when Mr. 
Takahashi said, &quot;Oh, and Nakamura, one more thing. If you ever go over 
my head like this again, I promise you, I&#39;ll forget we are professional 
men in a well established school. Do you understand me? And close the 
door. There&#39;s no reason for this conversation between myself and Ami to 
concern anyone else.&quot;

Ami squeaked in alarm when the door behind her was slammed shut with a 
bang that rivaled a gunshot. She closed her eyes for a moment and 
composed herself mentally. After all, she knew that what was coming 
would be far worse.

The principal sat back in his chair and regarded her for a moment. Then 
he said, &quot;I&#39;m not going to ask you what happened, because we already 
know. According to your students, two Senshi showed up in your 
classroom, and you had your students evacuate the room unescorted, 
because you decided it was best to stay behind and try to reason with 
them.&quot;

He rubbed his forehead a moment, then said, &quot;After that, well . . . 
Sensei, I&#39;m sorry we have to have this discussion, but the school board, 
myself, and A.P. Nakamura do not take kindly to one of our classrooms 
being destroyed. I just need to know one thing from you before we finish 
our business here, Mizuno Sensei. Why on God&#39;s green earth did you 
decide to try to reason with people who can take down a skyscraper in 
ten minutes with time to spare?&quot;

Without hesitation, Ami answered the only way she knew how. With the 
truth. &quot;For the safety of the children, sir. These Senshi were obviously 
there for a reason. I felt to leave with my students without giving them 
whatever it was they wanted would only result in a high casualty rate. I 
know that the procedures for an emergency situation specifically state 
that I&#39;m to stay with the students, but in this case I did not feel that 
was the best choice of action.&quot;

He got out of his chair and stood in front of her, regarding her 
curiously for a moment. Then he said, &quot;I see. And were you able to find 
out whatever it was they were after?&quot;

&quot;No, sir. I was not.&quot;

He nodded thoughtfully, then said, &quot;I see. So, when the shooting 
started, you made a run for it. The students that saw that part said 
that two Senshi were chasing another, but I believe that what they were 
really seeing was them chasing after you.&quot;

He laughed, then said, &quot;After all, the only way they could have been 
chasing another Senshi, would be that you are a Senshi, since according 
to every single eyewitness, you were the only other person in there with 
them. And of course, that idea is pure fantasy, isn&#39;t it, Sensei?&quot;

Ami laughed nervously and said, &quot;Of course it is, sir. That would be 
silly. I&#39;m a professional teacher, not a super heroine.&quot;

He nodded his head absently then asked, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you check in with us 
once you got away from them, Sensei?&quot;

It was the question Ami had been the most worried about. She still had 
yet to come up with an answer that she felt would satisfy him.

She closed her eyes and took a deep breath before answering. &quot;I have no 
excuse sir.&quot;

He picked up one of his sheets of notes, and reread it to make certain 
that he had all the facts straight, then said, &quot;According to your 
emergency contact, you were in the hospital about an hour after your 
classroom was attacked, being treated for a nasty gash to the side of 
your waist. No doubt, at the time you were being the typical woman, 
distraught by the rather unusual interruption to your otherwise normal 
day up to that point. By the time you were released, it was too late in 
the day for you to have possibly contacted us.&quot;

Ami suddenly felt a pang of guilt tug at her. Her emergency contact, her 
mother, had apparently falsified Makoto&#39;s medical records to say it was 
Ami who had been injured instead of Makoto. It didn&#39;t sit right with her 
that her mother had to lie for her, but under the circumstances, she 
remained quiet.

He looked at her, then added, &quot;Now, I think that&#39;s a reasonable reaction 
for a woman who is just a teacher, and since your contact is a doctor 
and was also there at the same time you were, I&#39;m not going to argue 
with it. Do you have anything you wish to add?&quot;

Ami shook her head no.

He put his papers back on his desk, then sat back down in his chair. 
&quot;Now, comes the part where I am placed in a rather difficult position, 
Sensei. Nakamura went above me to contact the school board, and he&#39;s 
asking for your head. On top of that, he seems to think that your 
sexuality alone demands that you should be removed from your job. As far 
as that goes, I personally feel that this is none of anyone&#39;s business 
but your own whether it is true or not. Also, Tokyo has city ordinances 
prohibiting job discrimination against homosexuals. However, the fact 
that he tossed that bone to the school board members to chew on along 
with what happened yesterday didn&#39;t help your cause any.&quot;

Pulling out a form from a drawer, he said, &quot;Thus, it is regrettable that 
despite my personal feelings, I must inform you that the school board 
has ordered me to punish you severely for this incident.&quot;

He placed the form on the desk so that it was facing Ami and said, 
&quot;However, they left it up to me to decide what to do with you. As such, 
I have come to a decision on what would be best for our fine school.&quot;

He paused as Ami picked up the paper and started reading it, then said, 
&quot;For neglecting to inform us that you were injured while away from the 
school in a manner that might interfere with your physical abilities to 
do your job, I am hereby placing you on paid administrative leave for 
two weeks to recover from your wound. This reprimand will go in your 
permanent record. Sign the bottom line, please.&quot; He smiled and finished 
by saying, &quot;I&#39;m very disappointed in you, Sensei.&quot;

Ami stammered, trying to hold back tears as the pressure she had been 
under suddenly lifted off her. She signed the writeup sheet then 
stammered, &quot;I . . . I don&#39;t know what to say, sir. I . . . Thank you?&quot;

He just got up and started walking to the door. &quot;You&#39;re a good teacher, 
Mizuno Sensei. I&#39;m not going to fire you for doing something right no 
matter how many people it ticks off. You can thank me by shutting the 
hell up and getting out of here. After all, you were supposed to be gone 
20 minutes ago. Enjoy your vacation, Ami. I look forward to seeing you 
back in front of a classroom in two weeks if your doctor feels you&#39;re up 
to it.&quot; Then he opened the door and held it for Ami as she left.

&quot;Oh, and Sensei, one more thing.&quot;

Ami looked over her shoulder at him as he said, &quot;I&#39;d appreciate it if 
you would in the future try to keep your fights off of school property, 
and away from expensive cars from now on. It turns out destruction 
suspected of being caused directly or indirectly from Senshi are not 
covered by insurance companies.&quot;

Ami started to stammer out something, but he stepped back into his 
office and calmly closed the door, leaving her to wonder if he was 
kidding or not. With Mr. Takahashi&#39;s sense of humor and intelligence, it 
was difficult to tell. So instead of dwelling on it, she turned and 
quickly made her way to Makoto to tell her the &#39;bad news&#39;.

Rei handed the last customer the charm he had just bought and pulled the 
shutter to the booth closed. Then she turned around to see if her 
&#39;assistant&#39; was cleaning or goofing off.

Sure enough, goofing off. Mina was facing away from Rei with a mirror 
out, calmly brushing her hair, her broom resting in the corner, probably 
unused. Almost as if to further enrage Rei, Mina was humming a happy 
little tune to herself.

Rei grabbed a rake that had been resting at her feet, gripping it 
tightly with both hands in an attempt to vent some of her frustration. 
She said from behind clenched teeth, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

Mina stopped humming and turned her mirror just a bit so she could see 
Rei, then said, &quot;Just what it looks like. Prettying myself up. It 
doesn&#39;t look like you did a thing with my hair after undressing me, 
Rei.&quot; She smiled to herself and said absently, &quot;So, what do you think? 
Should I sleep in bed with you, or do you want to curl up on the floor 
with me?&quot;

Rei folded her arms and said, &quot;I think you&#39;re the laziest person I have 
ever met.&quot;

Mina turned around and batted her eyelashes, saying, &quot;Now that we are 
together, I figure we could spend some &#39;quality time&#39; getting to know 
each other.&quot;

Rei hissed, &quot;You speak as if we are a couple. I took you in to help and 
maybe enlighten you, not get laid!&quot;

&quot;Oh, come on, Rei. You know you want me. So why don&#39;t you, ya know, just 
take me already and get it over with?&quot;

Rei smiled a bit at her own thoughts, then said, &quot;I admit I have some 
feelings for you.&quot;

Then her expression darkened again. &quot;But only god himself knows why! If 
you think that all love is, is for two people to treat each other like 
produce at the supermarket, you&#39;re going to find me a mighty expensive 
melon to buy! If you want us to have a relationship like that, you&#39;re 
going to have to earn my affection!&quot;

To prove her point, Rei swung her rake at Mina&#39;s head, causing the 
blonde to finally pick up her broom -- even if it was just to block 
another attack from the angry Miko.

Makoto had now joined Minako in sitting on the hood of her car. She 
started to look at her watch again, but Minako stopped her by saying, 
&quot;She&#39;ll get here when she gets here. Regardless of what she has when she 
gets out, she&#39;ll still have her friends and you, Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto looked down at her feet trying to reclaim some of her usual 
strength. She knew she would need to be strong for Ami when she finally 
got out. Still, she knew she couldn&#39;t hide her true feelings from her 
friends. &quot;I know, Mina-chan, it&#39;s just I&#39;m worried about her. Her job is 
a huge part of her life. If Ami . . . Ami!&quot;

Makoto looked up just in time to see Ami step out the door, breathing a 
sigh of relief before calmly starting to head toward them. She jumped 
off the hood of the car and closed the distance between them, squeezing 
Ami in a tight hug before she could say a word.

By the time Minako and Usagi had caught up, they heard Ami saying, &quot;Yes, 
I&#39;m serious. I&#39;m on paid leave while I recover from your wound, and 
that&#39;s that. So we need to think of a way to spend the next two weeks 
together, because I have nothing else to do.&quot;

Usagi squeezed Makoto and Ami tightly as she yelled in excitement, &quot;Then 
this calls for a celebration! We all have the evening off, so I&#39;ve got a 
great idea. Why don&#39;t we all get together like old times, meet up at 
Rei&#39;s and pull an all-nighter? Makoto can cook dinner, and--&quot;

Minako grumbled under her breath, &quot;I don&#39;t like that plan. Have you 
forgotten about Rei&#39;s tag-a-long?&quot;

Usagi shrugged and said, &quot;The more the merrier. Besides, she&#39;s less 
likely to do anything if all of us are there anyway.&quot;

Minako was about to argue with Usagi when she realized something. As 
much as she hated to admit it, for once, Usagi was right. It really 
would be a good idea for all of them to be together, if only to keep an 
eye on Mina. Even if it was only temporary. It would also allow them to 
see how things were working with Rei watching over the Sekkou. Thus, 
despite her reservations and with a little more pleading from Usagi, 
Minako agreed, and they piled into Makoto&#39;s car.

When the four of them got to the steps of the shrine, things started out 
how they always did. Well, most things. As they walked up the steps, 
Usagi and Minako chatted about the latest celebrity gossip, Ami and 
Makoto walking quietly behind them holding each others&#39; hand.

Despite the fact that they had been rather intimate together when alone, 
any form of public display of affection was something Ami still hadn&#39;t 
quite gotten used to. She would blush slightly and a small, somewhat 
embarrassed yet happy smile would form on her lips whenever Makoto gave 
her hand a gentle squeeze. Still, Ami felt it was important to somehow 
let Makoto know how she felt.

Ami cleared her throat to get Makoto&#39;s attention, then said, &quot;Do you 
ever think about gravity?&quot;

&quot;Uh . . . no? Should I?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s an attractive power between two objects on an atomic scale, like 
two baseballs on a table. They will have an incredibly minute 
gravitational attraction between there atoms. If you get a larger 
object, say, two chunks of lead, the gravitational pull will increase to 
a measurable amount. Then, get an object the size of a planet, and you 
get a significant amount of gravity, strong enough to bind two objects 
together.&quot;

Ami&#39;s cheeks turned a slightly darker shade of pink as she said, &quot;Our 
relationship is like that. The last one, I mean.&quot;

Makoto pretended to be shocked, saying, &quot;Ami Mizuno, are you hitting on 
me?&quot; Then she giggled and said, &quot;That has to be the most . . . cheesy 
pickup line I have ever heard.&quot;

Ami looked just a little disappointed in herself, then said, &quot;I was 
merely attempting to openly express my feelings for you in a more public 
way, something couples do from time to time. If that is how you feel 
about my attempts at flirting then perhaps you could give me some advice 
later over--&quot;

She stopped when she saw Usagi and Minako start running the rest of the 
way up the stairs suddenly without warning. Then they heard the yelling 
as the sounds of two women in a heated argument cut through the 
afternoon air.

When they got there, they were happy there were no patrons visiting the 
shrine at the moment. Rei and Mina were standing in the middle of the 
courtyard screaming at each other at the top of their lungs.

Rei screamed, &quot;Oh! I see! So I am the one in the wrong because actually 
want to get some work done! And you said you were a responsible 
individual. You can&#39;t even sweep a damn sidewalk!&quot;

Mina stomped her foot and screamed back, &quot;All I&#39;m saying is that I find 
it hard to believe you don&#39;t find this work the least bit demeaning! 
It&#39;s for stupid people incapable of any thought of their own!&quot;

Rei picked up on the insult immediately. She slammed her broom on the 
ground and grumbled, &quot;I&#39;ll show you who&#39;s stupid!&quot; then she ran at the 
Sekkou, ready to tear her apart with her bare hands.

Usagi and Minako ran forward to separate the two of them and try to 
restore order. Makoto and Ami hung back since they felt the two could 
handle this on their own. Besides, Ami&#39;s comment had gotten Makoto 
thinking.

Makoto said, &quot;So uh, Ami, about the whole gravity thing.&quot;

She saw Ami scrunch up her face in irritation, but before she could say 
anything, Makoto said, &quot;No, seriously. Did you mean it?&quot; Makoto smiled 
as she asked, &quot;Are you attracted to me like . . . gravity?&quot;

Ami smiled back shyly, and said. &quot;Of course.&quot;

Makoto shuffled her feet a moment, then said, &quot;Well, I came up with this 
idea, you see. . . originally to help you out if you lost your job . . . 
so if you don&#39;t want to I&#39;ll understand. But uh . . . well, you see . . 
.&quot; Before she could talk herself out of it, Makoto blurted out, &quot;What 
would you say if I asked you to move in with me?&quot;

Ami turned to Makoto with a serious expression on her face. &quot;Makoto, 
that&#39;s a huge commitment. We would have to think about how we divide up 
the bills, work out personal space, adjust to each other&#39;s bad habits, 
learn how to time showers right so we don&#39;t use up all the hot water and 
leave the other to freeze.&quot;

Makoto shrunk back a bit and mumbled, &quot;Like I said, you don&#39;t have to 
if--&quot;

Ami wasn&#39;t finished. &quot;We would have to figure out who does what chores, 
decide where my things are going, learn to tolerate our different 
approaches to decoration. As well as our differences in decision making, 
which will invariably lead to us trying to learn to compromise, and I am 
certain there are many other things I have yet to think of.&quot;

Makoto waited to make sure Ami was through talking, then replied, &quot;Well 
. . . like I said. It&#39;s just an idea.&quot; She sighed in frustration, 
saying, &quot;Okay, you know what, forget I said anything. Don&#39;t give it a 
second thought.&quot;

Ami grabbed both of Makoto&#39;s hands and said happily, &quot;That&#39;s right. I 
don&#39;t have to give it a second thought. I am glad you understand. It is 
a rash, totally illogical, irresponsible thing to do at this point in 
our relationship because it is just entirely too soon.&quot;

Makoto let Ami hold her hands and did her best to hide her 
disappointment with Ami&#39;s opinion, watching the battle between Rei and 
Mina continuing despite Usagi and Minako being between the two of them. 
Ami&#39;s voice drew her attention away from it all quicker than a blast of 
cold water.

&quot;So, naturally, if you asked me I would have no choice but to accept.&quot;
