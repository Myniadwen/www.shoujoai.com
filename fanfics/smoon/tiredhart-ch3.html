<h1>A Tired Heart's Desire (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/balticbard.html">Balticbard</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/tiredhart-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Days passed slowly for the tired senshi of water, Amy, as she watched 
patiently over her friends, Mina, and Rei. It seemed that Rei recovered 
quickly, for in just two days, the gorgeous senshi of fire was up, and 
about, and caring lovingly for her Mina, her blond lover. Mina was 
extremely weak, and could hardly move at all, possibly because she had 
taken the greater force of the tentacled monster&#39;s energy blast, and 
had almost been drained completely of her life source. 

It seemed as if Rei had never been sick, or on the verge of death 
itself, and it was almost as if she was back to her old self. Rei took 
great care of her beautiful, blond senshi of love. Everyday, Rei would 
bathe, clothe, and feed Mina. Rei would never leave Mina&#39;s side, 
catering to her every whim. Rei would read to Mina, brush, and braid 
her long, flaxen hair, give her massages, and hold her tightly when the 
blond senshi cried out of fear, and shame. 

Mina could hardly move by herself, that very first week that she woke 
up from her almost fatal sleep of death. Inside, Mina&#39;s mind worked 
properly, but physically she was far from well. Mina was stricken by an 
almost overwhelming weakness that almost paralyzed her completely. At 
times, Mina felt like screaming in her deep despair, and many more 
times, the senshi of love, and beauty wished that she were completely 
dead. But the constant presence of her stunningly beautiful, brunette 
lover, kept Mina from going mad. Amid her strange malady, Mina could 
still feel deep pleasure, as her ravishing senshi doll of fire embraced 
her, and whispered gentle words of love, comfort, and encouragement in 
her ear. 

Mina thought that she had loved Rei deeply before the almost fatal 
attack of the tentacled monster that nearly killed her. But now, Mina 
felt her love for Rei deepen into pure adoration, as she watched how 
the girl lovingly, and diligently cared for her. With tears streaming 
from her deep, blue eyes, Mina would watch as Rei bathed her, then 
dressed her. Rei would feed Mina with infinite care. Rei would massage 
the blond&#39;s tired body. Rei would soothe Mina&#39;s sexual arousals for her 
with velvet kisses, and gentle caresses. Mina would close her tired 
eyes at night, and sleep peacefully, feeling Rei&#39;s slender, gentle arms 
around her. 

Mina would watch the others come, and care for her; Lita would come, 
and feed her sometimes. Amy would come, and read to her. Darian would 
come, and tell her stories, and make her laugh. But they would all 
leave, returning to their own worlds. Only Rei would stay with her day, 
and night. The only one who never came, but greeted her cooly from a 
distance was Serena, and Mina was glad to keep it that way. 

Serena kept her distance, and watched with guilt, and longing, as Rei, 
her precious lover grew farther, and farther from her; as far as 
eternity. Serena would cry herself to sleep, missing the warm, 
voluptuous body of the fire goddess inher arms. It just wasn&#39;t fair 
that Rei was no longer hers. It was her fault for not having left 
Darian for Rei. But Serena had explained it to Rei many times; she was 
destined to marry Darian, it was her duty, but that was all. Serena&#39;s 
marriage to Darian was of convenience, but not love. Of course, Serena, 
and Darian felt affection for each other, but there would never be any 
real, sexual, romantic love between them. Darian was a homosexual, and 
would continue to have a secret lover even after his proper marriage to 
Serena. Of course, Serena would do the same; her secret lover would 
have been the gorgeous fire senshi, Rei. 

Serena had explained the circumstances of her future marrieage to Rei a 
million times; yes, she was to marry Darian, but no, she would not 
share his bed. Her marriage to Darian was one of convenience, but not 
love. 

Serena had promised Rei her heart, but could not promise the ravishing 
girl her life; and that was what Rei wanted most from her. Rei didn&#39;t 
want to live in the shadows, she didn&#39;t want to have love halfway. No. 
Fiery, passionate Rei wanted all of Serena; her time, and her life, and 
since she couldn&#39;t have that, she simply slipped away from Serena&#39;s 
embrace. 

Now, Serena watched in silence, pain tearing at her tormented heart, as 
Rei, the love of her life, grew forever away, and out of her desperate 
reach. 

A week passed in the agonizingly slow recovery of Mina, the blond 
senshi of love. Mina&#39;s travails were to be long, and difficult. Gently, 
slowly, Mina began to thrive once more, and the strength returned to 
her young body. Mina was eventually able to sit up, then dress herself, 
eat on her own, walk for at least a short distance. Mina did recover, 
but she still clung wholly to the her gorgeous lover, Rei, who was 
constantly at her side. 

One lazy afternoon, while Mina lay in the small bed that she shared 
with Rei, while she slept profoundly, her senshi doll, the goddess of 
fire, slipped quietly away from her, from the tight prison of the 
beautiful blond&#39;s arms. Rei left the room where Mina slept, and entered 
an adjoining room that was filled with stacks of books, newspapers, and 
magazines, and served as a sort of small library for the group of 
crimefighters. Rei passed several high stacks of medical, scientific, 
and engineering books that belonged to Amy, and Darian. The senshi of 
fire went directly to the stacks of fashion magazines, and romance 
novels that lay scattered in a corner, where she, Serena, and Mina 
loved to sit on an old sofa to read them. Amy would get angry at them, 
and call such things &quot;poisonous literature,&quot; then sneak in after all of 
the gang was gone to read them herself. Rei smiled at the memory of 
catching a supposedly totally logical, studious Amy drooling over the 
pages of one of the more erotic romance novels. 

Serena would usually be the most lazy, unpunctual person in the world 
for everything in her life. But for the last two weeks, Serena had been 
coming in almost at dawn to the lab, with a single purpose; to see Rei. 
Amy would smile, and shake her head at the sight of a pale, blond girl, 
still with half-lidded, sleep laden eyes, tousled hair, improperly 
dressed, slipping into the lab just to see Rei, just to watch the 
beautiful brunette asleep in Mina&#39;s possesive arms. 

Pity would flourish in Amy&#39;s heart, as she watched the poor, lovesick 
Serena kneel beside Mina&#39;s bed, and silently watch her two senshi 
sleeping. Serena would reach out, and gently caress Rei&#39;s sleeping 
face. Amy would have to stop looking, for tears would come, unbidden to 
her dark eyes, as she watched the sad, tormented look in her princess&#39;s 
eyes. Amy loved Serena more than anyone, and would gladly comfort her. 
But Amy knew very well that Serena would never accept anyone else in 
her aching heart, that would always belong to beautiful Rei. 

&quot;I think that Mina loves Rei dearly, with all of her heart,&quot; Amy 
whispered to her own, aching, unfulfilled heart, &quot;but I think that 
Serena is the one who loves her the most.....how I envy Rei.....&quot; 

Smiling, Rei sat on the sofa, and began to read her romance novel about 
a handsome pirate who kidnapped a beautiful, wild-hearted princes. Rei 
then heard a feather light footsteps coming down the hall, and smiled 
knowingly, &quot;I&#39;m in here, Mina....&quot; Like the softes echo, Rei&#39;s voice 
flew from her full, ruby lips to the air, to the walls of the room that 
surrounded her in quiet presence, to the welcoming entrance of the 
room, through which came an unexpected presence. 

&quot;No....its not Mina....&quot; a soft voice responded playfully, &quot;its 
me......&quot; 

&quot;Serena.....&quot; Rei&#39;s beautiful countenance lost it&#39;s playful mask, her 
fine-features became engulfed in shades of worry, &quot;what?&quot; Rei felt 
suddenly very uncomfortable, out of place, guilt flooding her heqrt at 
the memory of Serena&#39;s love for her. Rei felt shame for being caught 
alone there, without Mina being present, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Serena...I&#39;ll 
leave right away....&quot; Rei got up from the sofa, but was stopped by an 
anxious, eager Serena. 

&quot;No.....Rei....please don&#39;t go.&quot; 

&quot;I have to go, Serena. I can&#39;t stay. You know why.&quot; 

&quot;Please, Rei.....don&#39;t run from me....I need to see you.&quot; 

Serena&#39;s soft presence, her supplicant voice seemed to calm the nervous 
senshi of fire, who quietly sat back down on the sofa. Serena kneeled 
before Rei, and got as close as she could to the ravishing brunette. 

&quot;Serena.....please....don&#39;t....&quot;Rei squirmed as Serena placed her 
small, pale hands on Rei&#39;s lap. 

&quot;Rei.....I love you....oh......Rei.....&quot; Serena&#39;s voice was already 
husky with love, with need, as she felt her desperate passion explode, 
causing her entire, slender frame to react, &quot;please....just talk to 
me.......&quot; Serena said, as she tried to control her trembling body, 
knowing that her apparent arousal would only frighten Rei away from 
her. 

&quot;Alright,&quot; Rei said, unsteadily, as she sat back down on the sofa once 
more. 

&quot;How are you, Rei?&quot; Serena asked anxiously, trying to steady her 
wandering hands. 

&quot;I&#39;m as fine as can be expected, Serena.&quot; 

A pause settled between the two, young women, as memories of their 
passion rose up within their hearts, and minds, as Rei unwillingly 
recalled, as Serena lovingly reminisced every moment of their time 
together. 

&quot;This isn&#39;t right, &quot; Rei whispered, as shame filled her heart. 

&quot;You&#39;re remembering....you can&#39;t help it, Rei,&quot; Serena said with 
urgency, &quot;you still love me.....&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;ve been over this before, Serena, &quot; Rei said nervously, as she 
began to squirm. But the more Rei squirmed, the more Serena advanced, 
opening a quick, forced path into the brunette&#39;s voluptuous body, 
&quot;Serena....stop that......don&#39;t.&quot; 

But Serena could no more stop herself, than she could stop breathing, 
as she agressively pushed Rei back onto the sofa, and climbed on top of 
her, &quot;Rei....please....I love you.....I need this!&quot; 

&quot;NO.....Serena.....I love Mina!&quot; 

Serena was crying now, as she hungrily settled onto Rei&#39;s warm, plush, 
curvaceous body. It had been so very long, since the beautiful, silvery 
blond Serena had felt Rei beneath her, and she had ached every single 
day, painfully, for this feeling once more. Serena was addicted to 
Rei&#39;s voluptuousness, to her scents of flowers, and incense, to the 
marvelous, silken softenss of Rei&#39;s alabaster skin, to the thrilling 
fullness of Rei&#39;s ripe, red lips, to the roundness of Rei&#39;s supple 
breasts against her own, to the velvety thickness of Rei&#39;s deep, raven 
locks tangling hin her pale, slender fingers. Serena was so very 
desperate, like a powerfully addicted fool who grabs at the drug she 
knows will satiate her needs. Now, Serena was far beyond the dictates 
of her mind. Now, Serena was ruled by her love, by her fiery passion 
that rose from the primal depths of her young, aroused body, &quot;I love 
you, Rei....I need to touch you....to make love to you, or I&#39;ll 
die....&quot; 

&quot;Its too late, Serena....let me go.....please....&quot; Rei pleaded, but 
knowing it an impossible thing, knowing that Serena would not release 
her, knowing that Mina had just awakened from her sleep, and would come 
looking for her, would find her like this, trapped in Serena&#39;s arms, 
and that all hell would break loose, &quot;Mina....&quot; 

At that very instant, the shadows parted from Mina&#39;s eyes, as she felt 
a strange urgency within her, a restlessness that seemed to call to 
her, &quot;Rei?&quot; Mina opened her eyes completely now, and turned her blond 
head, looking about her in confusion, searching for the warm body of 
her lover, realizing that the girl was gone from her arms. Mina sat up 
in the tiny bed, and looked about her, &quot;I know Rei isn&#39;t far away...how 
far can you go in this lab? And Amy would kill Rei if she went 
outside....&quot; Mina closed her eyes for just a moment, and concentrated, 
as she tried to link telepathically to her lover, &quot;Rei is in the 
library....something is wrong.....Rei needs me....&quot; Mina got up from 
the bed, as she moved quickly towards the door, as she felt nervous, as 
she acutely felt her lover&#39;s discomfort, as if she were Rei herself. 

Meanwhile, Rei tried unsuccessfully tried to still Serena&#39;s gentle, 
wandering hands, &quot;Serena, don&#39;t....Mina is coming.&quot; 

&quot;You remember my love, Rei.....your body still remembers me.....&quot; 
Serena said through her thick tears, as she ground herself into Rei, in 
a wild, erotic, desperate sway, &quot;YOU STILL LOVE ME!&quot; 

Rei said no more, as her full lips were captured, and sucked, and 
kissed hungrily by Serena&#39;s moist, pink lips. 

&quot;WHAT IS GOING ON?&quot; 

At the entrance to the small library, where Serena ravished Rei, stood 
an angry, jealous blond senshi named Mina. 

&quot;SERENA, GET OFF MY WIFE!&quot; 

&quot;REI BELONGS TO ME!&quot; Serena yelled back at an enraged Mina, &quot;she was 
mine first. YOU STOLE HER FROM ME!&quot; 

Serena had removed herself from Rei, and now stood up, facing Mina. Now 
Serena was going to do something that she desired more than making love 
to Rei; she was going to tear Mina to pieces. 

Mina felt like she was going to explode. All that Mina could feel was 
the overwhelming urge to kill Serena with her bare hands. But suddenly, 
Mina felt a strange throbbing within her that began to turn into an 
intense pain, &quot;ooooooohhhhhh....what&#39;s happening to me?&quot; Now, Mina 
doubled over, agony written indelibly on her pretty, blond features, 
&quot;Rei....I need you,&quot; was all that Mina could say, because at that 
moment, all that she wanted to do was to touch her precious senshi 
doll, thinking that would stop the terrible, almost crippling pain that 
now wracked her body. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Serena screamed, as she pushed Mina back out into the hall, &quot;I 
WON&#39;T LET YOU TOUCH REI EVER AGAIN!&quot; 

&quot;Serena.....DON&#39;T!&quot; Rei cried desperately, &quot;please let me go to 
Mina.....SHE NEEDS ME!&quot; 

&quot;NO!&quot; was all that a vindictive, enraged Serena could yell, as she held 
Rei fast in her arms, &quot;you&#39;re MINE, Rei, and I am never, NEVER going to 
let you go!&quot; 

&quot;REI!&quot; Mina screamed in pain, &quot;REI, HELP ME!&quot; 

&quot;MINA!&quot; Rei cried now, as she struggled to free herself from Serena&#39;s 
iron embrace. 

Mina was screaming now, and her beautiful body seemed to be stretching, 
cracking, with skin breaking, and horrible, grayish tentacles coming 
from within her. Then, there was a loud, popping sound, a flash of 
intense, white light, then Mina, in her human form disappeared. What 
there was instead, was a huge, grayish, many tentacled monster like the 
one that had previously attacked Mina, and Rei. But this one wasn&#39;t the 
other monster; this one was Mina, monstrous in form, and still enraged, 
jealous, and MURDEROUS. 

&quot;NNNNNNOOOOOOO!&quot; Rei&#39;s cry seemed to be ripped from her bleeding flesh, 
&quot;MINA....NO!&quot; Rei still struggled to reach her lover, who was now a 
twisted pile of monstrous flesh, &quot;MINA!&quot; But Rei was unable to break 
the iron, vice-like grip of Serena&#39;s slender arms around her tiny 
waist. 

Mina, now transformed into a monstrousity, was nonetheless human 
within, still in love with Rei, still angry, jealous, and extremely 
resentful of Serena. Seeing that Serena kept Rei away from her, a 
deeply enraged Mina blindly attacked the princess that she had once 
sworn to serve, and protect forever. 

Serena turned, and was shocked to see Mina charge wildly at her. Out of 
pure instinct, Serena freed one hand, and from her fingers issued forth 
a blinding blast of light that quickly engulfed the tentacled thing 
that Mina had become. Quickly, a dark chasm appeared; what seemed to be 
a void that surrounded Mina, and swallowed her. All that could be heard 
now, were the distant echoes of Mina&#39;s cries, now bestial screeches of 
a thing that no longer had a voice. 

Silence fell heavily, seeming more like a heavy, life-absent thing, 
than the usual mantle of peace that it usually was. The silent wave 
lasted for a mere few seconds, only to be shattered by a long, painful 
wail. 

&quot;OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNOOOOOOOOOOOOO!&quot; 

At the sound of Serena&#39;s scream, Amy, Lita, and Darian came running as 
fast as they could. All three of them entered the library, to find 
Serena weeping on the floor, lying on top of Rei, who was deathly pale, 
and as still as death itself.
