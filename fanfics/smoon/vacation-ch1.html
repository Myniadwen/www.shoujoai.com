<h1>Vacation</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/reihime.html">ReiHime</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Konichiwa minna...
This story is about the cute relationship between Hotaru and Chibi Usa. 
I know that there are a lot of people who don&#39;t believe that Hotaru and 
Chibi Usa are together, but I think the two of them are cute so that&#39;s 
why I wrote it. If anyone is offended by the idea of them together, by 
lesbians, or just by sex, don&#39;t read the fic. This is my first real 
attempt at writing a hentai fanfic, so please don&#39;t judge it too 
harshly... Newayz...  I hope ya like it...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Why do you want the keys to the beach house?&quot; Michiru asked 
curiously, as she lifted her cup to sip some of her coffee.
        &quot;Chibi Usa and I are gonna go down to the shore for a little 
vacation&quot; Hotaru answered cheerfully.
        &quot;Just the two of you, on a vacation together?&quot; Haruka chimed 
in, one eyebrow raised up, and a little smile on her face. Hotaru&#39;s 
face suddenly turned a deep crimson red.
        &quot;N...N...NOT LIKE THAT!&quot; Hotaru stammered out angrily to her 
&quot;papa&quot;. Haruka gave a slight giggle as she sipped her own cup of 
coffee.
        &quot;Oh Haruka&quot; Michiru began as she placed a hand on Haruka&#39;s, 
&quot;stop teasing her.&quot;
        Haruka put her cup back on the table and gave a slight apology 
to Hotaru. She got up from her seat, and went to her jacket on the 
living room coat rack. After digging through all the pockets, she 
returned to the kitchen holding a shiny sliver key. She tossed it
toward her little daughter. Hotaru caught it with ease, and smiled back 
at her papa. &quot;Just don&#39;t wreck the place okay? You know how mad your 
mom and Setsuna get when they have to clean house.&quot; She looked at her 
wife sitting at the table, and gave her a warm smile. Michiru returned 
it with a smirk. Hotaru began giggling, and ran to her papa, giving her
the strongest hug she could. Michiru couldn&#39;t resist laughing as she 
saw Haruka gasping for air. After releasing her papa, Hotaru ran to her 
mama and gave her a kiss on the cheek. She then ran off to her room to 
get some clothes packed.
        Haruka sat back down across from Michiru. She began scratching 
the back of her head. &quot;Geez, that girl is getting stronger.&quot;
        Michiru gave her a loving smile. &quot;You know, you really 
shouldn&#39;t talk about her and Chibi Usa that way.&quot;
        &quot;Oh come on Michi, we both know how Hotaru feels about Chibi 
Usa.&quot; She replied in an effort to defend herself. &quot;Setsuna has already 
seen the two of them together in the future.&quot;
        &quot;I know Ruka, demo, Hotaru doesn&#39;t know about her future. Plus, 
she really isn&#39;t comfortable with the idea of her and Chibi Usa yet. 
Right now they only think of each other as best friends. When the time 
comes, they&#39;ll realize their true feelings for one another, but until 
then, lets not rush them into it.&quot;
        Haruka sighed, leaned forward, and held Michiru&#39;s hand. &quot;Okay, 
you win... I won&#39;t mention it again.&quot;
        Michiru leaned forward so that her lips were only centimeters 
from Haruka&#39;s. She brushed her lips against the other girl&#39;s softly, 
and whispered &quot;I always win&quot; before the two began kissing passionately.
        Hotaru walked back into the kitchen to say goodbye to her 
parents. She saw them kissing over the table, and sighed. &quot;Gods you 
two. Get a room.&quot;
        This brought them back to reality, and the two women looked at 
Hotaru and smiled. Hotaru walked over to them, and gave each a kiss on 
the cheek before saying goodbye. She ran outside, and started her black 
convertible. Haruka and Michiru went over to the front door to watch 
her leave. &quot;So you think they&#39;ll realize over this &#39;vacation&#39;?&quot; Haruka 
whispered, as she waved to Hotaru. Michiru smiled. &quot;Maybe&quot;, she 
replied.  Hotaru backed out of the driveway, and headed to the Silver 
Palace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;So how long are you two gonna be on this vacation?&quot; Queen 
Serenity asked her 16 year-old daughter.
        &quot;Uh&quot; Chibi Usa began as she burrowed through her huge closet, 
looking for her favorite pants. &quot;Only for the weekend. I can&#39;t really 
afford to stay any more than that considering all the work I have.&quot; She 
jumped out the closet with the pants, and ran to her bed to pack them.
        Queen Serenity looked around her daughter&#39;s enormous bedroom, 
and a huge sweatdrop formed over her brow. The room looked like a 
mother&#39;s worst nightmare, clothes strewn about everywhere; books and 
dolls covering the floor. &quot;Gods&quot;, she muttered out, &quot;your room is more 
of a mess than mine ever was at sixteen.&quot; Chibi Usa gave her a wide 
smile. &quot;Well, I was inspired by you in the past.&quot; Serenity, gave her an 
evil glare (equal to the one she usually gave Mars Hime). The two girls 
stayed looking at each other, and soon burst out into laughter at how 
stupid the other looked.
        &quot;Ahh&quot; Chibi Usa said as she wiped her forehead. &quot;I&#39;m finally 
done packing.&quot; Serenity&#39;s eyes widened as she saw her daughter line up 
five huge suitcases. &quot;Ano, Chibi Usa, do you really think you need that 
much clothing for just a weekend?&quot; Chibi Usa gave her mother a 
surprised look. &quot;I want to be prepared for anything.&quot; Another sweat 
drop formed on Serenity&#39;s head. But she figured it would be best not to 
argue the subject. Chibi Usa turned out as stubborn as she was, and she 
realized that arguing would do nothing to change her mind.
        Just then, a servant knocked on Chibi Usa&#39;s door. &quot;Begging your 
pardon Serenity Sama, Usagi-Hime.&quot; He bowed to both women. &quot;Hotaru-Hime 
is here for you Usagi-Hime.&quot; Both women thanked him, and asked for 
servants to take Chibi Usa&#39;s bags down to the car.
        Chibi Usa kissed both her parents and waved bye to the four 
princesses as she jumped into Hotaru&#39;s car. Hotaru looked over at her 
friend. &quot;Ne, Odango-chan, was five suitcases really necessary?&quot;
        Chibi Usa stuck her tongue out at her friend, and the two 
laughed. Hotaru started the car, and the two went through the castle 
gate, onto the road.
        &quot;Those two are so kawai&quot; Mars said as she watched them drive 
off.
        &quot;Yup&quot; Venus agreed. &quot;They make the perfect couple.&quot;
        Queen Serenity thought back on the vision that Pluto had told 
her of, and hoped that everything went all right with the two girls.
        &quot;Ahhhh&quot; Chibi Usa yawned as she stretched her arms above her 
head. &quot;It feels so good to be away from the palace sometimes.&quot; She 
looked over at Hotaru and frowned. Hotaru hadn&#39;t said anything since 
they left the palace. She just looked straight ahead at the road, 
seemingly deep in thought.
        Usa inched closer to her friend. She called her name a couple 
of times, but with no reply. She let out a big sigh, and sat back in 
her seat. &quot;Whatever she&#39;s thinking about must be pretty damn important&quot; 
she thought to herself, as she closed her eyes to get some rest.
        In fact, it was very important, at least to Hotaru. She was 
thinking about Chibi Usa. That morning&#39;s comment by Haruka was not 
unusual, she had made comments like that to Hotaru plenty of other 
times. Each time, Hotaru would deny having such feelings for her best 
friend, but inside she had already begun to question it. It wasn&#39;t like 
she had anything against lesbians, her own parents were lesbians, she 
had been brought up around it... But she just hadn&#39;t ever thought of 
herself as one. She thought she understood where her parents had gotten 
the idea from, she had never really been interested in guys, in fact 
the whole idea of dating a guy hadn&#39;t even crossed her mind even though 
she was already 17. But that didn&#39;t mean she liked girls. Then she 
thought of Chibi Usa. She never failed to notice how good Chibi Usa 
looked, but she would always dismiss it as just a friend noticing how 
someone else dressed. It also occurred to her that she would always 
take an extra amount of time when getting ready whenever she was going 
anywhere with Chibi Usa, but she just figured that there was nothing 
wrong with wanting to look good for a friend. After everything they had 
been through in the past, it didn&#39;t surprise her that she loved Chibi 
Usa, but she wasn&#39;t sure just what kind of love it was. They were 
emotionally very close. They never failed to notice if something was 
wrong with each other, and always shared their deepest feelings with 
one another. But Hotaru convinced herself that that was what best 
friends always did. Then she remembered the thoughts that she had had. 
Sometimes, when they would talk together, Hotaru would have an erg to 
lean over and kiss Chibi Usa. Actually, it wasn&#39;t just kissing. She had 
had thoughts of doing stuff that only Haruka and Michiru do, stuff 
like...
        The radio suddenly went on, and broke Hotaru&#39;s train of 
thought. She looked beside her, and saw Chibi Usa starring at her very 
concerned. &quot;Daijobu?&quot; Chibi Usa asked timidly. Her eyes expressed her 
deep worry over her friend.
        She looks so pretty, Hotaru thought. She quickly erased the 
thought from her mind, as she assured her friend that she was fine. 
&quot;I&#39;m fine, Odango-chan. You don&#39;t have to worry about me.&quot;
        Chibi Usa raised an eyebrow as she continued to stare at 
Hotaru. She still felt that something was bothering Hotaru, but she 
obviously didn&#39;t want to tell her about it right now. Hotaru looked 
back at the road ahead, trying desperately to avoid Chibi Usa&#39;s 
questioning eyes. She knew she should tell Chibi Usa about these 
thoughts she&#39;d been having. Inside her, she knew it was the only way 
that she would feel better, but she was scared at how her friend would 
take it. She resolved that sometime during this vacation, she would sit 
down and talk to Usa about it, she had to or else she would go nuts.
        &quot;We&#39;re almost there Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru said cheerfully. &quot;Uh 
huh&quot; Chibi Usa replied, picking up the hint that they should change the 
subject. She turned back to face the road. The rest of the trip was 
traveled in silence.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;SUGOI!&quot; Usa exclaimed as she looked at the fantastic sunset on 
the water. They had arrived at the house just in time see it. Usa sat 
down on the sand, wriggling her toes into it, and watched the fantastic 
site.
        Hotaru came out of the house, and saw Usa sitting there in the 
sand. A huge smile spread across her face, as she watched Usa. Hearing 
a door shut, Chibi Usa looked behind her, and saw Hotaru leaning on the 
car, smiling as she quietly watched her. Usa smiled back at her friend, 
and beckoned her to sit with her in the sand. Hotaru began walking, and 
sat down next to Usa. Usa quickly grabbed Hotaru&#39;s arm, and leaned her 
head on the girl&#39;s shoulder. Hotaru was somewhat surprised by the 
gesture, but decided to go one step further, and pulled her arm out of 
Usa grasp. Usa was ready to say something, but was quieted when she 
felt Hotaru&#39;s arm around her waist. Usa leaned closer to her friend, 
and the two watched as the sun set behind the water.
        After the sunset, Hotaru looked down at Usa. She had known the 
girl had fallen asleep in her arms some time ago, but thought she was 
too peaceful looking to wake up. She sighed as she brushed a strand of 
hair away from Usa&#39;s face. Usa really was very beautiful. Many boys in 
Crystal Tokyo had asked the Princess for a date, but she had turned 
them all down flat. She had told Hotaru that none of them had 
interested her, not even the handsome ones. She said that she was still 
waiting for her &quot;Prince on a white horse&quot;. Thinking of it made Hotaru 
feel somewhat sad. She didn&#39;t want to think about anyone holding Usa 
the way she was. It felt so good to hold her, it gave her a warm 
feeling throughout her body. It just felt right, and she didn&#39;t want 
anyone to take that feeling away from her.
        A cold wind suddenly hit her, and she held Usa a little 
tighter. Night was falling, and it would be getting cold very soon. 
Hotaru began calling Usa softly to wake her up. Usa&#39;s eyes blinked open 
sleepily, and she looked up into Hotaru&#39;s face. Suddenly, the feeling 
was back. Hotaru looked into Usa&#39;s sleepy gorgeous face, and before she 
could think to stop herself, placed her lips softly on Usa&#39;s. To her 
surprise, Usa didn&#39;t pull away, in fact, she moved into the kiss. 
Hotaru&#39;s eyes closed as she let the feeling wash over her. Hotaru 
slowly backed away after what seemed like an eternity, and looked back 
at Usa. Usa just closed her eyes, and snuggled back into Hotaru. 
Hotaru, feeling the cold wind again, stood and picked Usa up from the 
sand. Usa unconsciously wrapped her arms around Hotaru&#39;s neck, and lay 
in her arms. Hotaru carried the sleeping princess into the house, and 
placed her in the guest room bed. She covered her with the quilt, and 
went into the kitchen.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        It had been about an hour when Usa finally awoke. She looked 
around, and realized she was in the house. She sat up in the bed, and 
stretched a bit. She was about to get up, when she remembered 
something. She thought back, and remembered the sunset, and she lying 
against Hotaru. Then she remembered a kiss. She had woken up, and was 
kissing someone. &quot;Hotaru&quot;, she whispered aloud as she placed her hand 
on her mouth. She got up out of bed, and went into the living room.
        Hotaru sat on the couch, with her head in her hands thinking 
about what had happened. During the hour, she had finally come to terms 
with the fact that she had feelings for Chibi Usa, feelings much 
stronger than that of just a friend, but she didn&#39;t know what she would 
say to the girl. It felt as if the world had changed because of a kiss. 
Would Chibi Usa be mad, disgusted? How could she look her best friend 
in the face again? But then, Chibi Usa had moved into the kiss, so 
maybe she...
        &quot;Taru-chan?&quot;
        Hotaru turned around sharply, and starred in surprise at Chibi 
Usa. Her heart began racing in her chest, and she swallowed hard. Chibi 
Usa moved around the couch, and sat next to Hotaru, not looking at her 
face. The two girls sat there in silence. Hotaru was freaking out, but 
it seemed that Chibi Usa was totally calm. Hotaru began fidgeting with 
her hands, praying to the Gods that Usa wasn&#39;t mad.
        &quot;Taru-chan&quot; Usa said again. &quot;Did you kiss me?&quot;
        Hotaru couldn&#39;t believe her ears. Chibi Usa sounded so calm. 
Her heart began racing faster. Could it be that she didn&#39;t totally 
remember what happened? Maybe she could just say that it must have been 
dream of Usa&#39;s. She was asleep and all, it would be a great excuse. No, 
Hotaru corrected herself. I promised myself that I was going to talk to 
her about this. Even thought I didn&#39;t want to bring it up like this, I 
still gotta get it off my chest. Hotaru swallowed hard, and turned to 
Chibi Usa, mouth open and ready to talk.
        Usa didn&#39;t give her a chance, and quickly moved forward, and 
kissed her friend full on the mouth. Hotaru was shocked, and initially 
tried to pull away, but Usa stayed on her, and pressed her lips harder 
onto Hotaru&#39;s... Hotaru&#39;s eyes began to close slowly, as she allowed 
the feeling to wash over her again. Chibi Usa leaned forward against 
Hotaru, and pushed her down onto the couch. Hotaru moved into the kiss 
more, and her arms went around Usa&#39;s waist. Hotaru was again shocked as 
she felt Usa&#39;s tongue slide into her open mouth. The two began probing 
each other&#39;s mouths now. Soon a new feeling began moving through 
Hotaru, one that was centered between her legs. Her hands began sliding 
up and down Usa&#39;s back, and reached under to explore the naked skin. 
Usa leaned back up over Hotaru, and pulled her shirt over her head, 
exposing her white satin bra. Hotaru went to reach for it, but Usa 
quickly removed it and threw it to the ground. Hotaru grabbed Usa&#39;s 
creamy round breasts and began massaging them. Usa moaned softly and 
arched her back, pusher her breasts into Hotaru&#39;s roaming hands.
        After a few moments Usa placed her hands on Hotaru&#39;s and 
stopped their movement. Hotaru was about to question it when Usa leaned 
back down, kissing her again. Usa pulled away, and whispered &quot;Follow 
me&quot; lustfully. She got off the couch (and Hotaru) and walked down the 
hall towards the master bedroom. Hotaru wasted no time jumping off the 
couch, and running after Usa.
        When she moved into the room, she saw that Usa had gotten under 
the covers of the bed, covering her totally except for her head. Hotaru 
began walking closer, until Usa said stop. Usa&#39;s face wore a devilish 
smile, and she bit her lower lip as she tossed something at Hotaru. She 
caught it, and upon further inspection, saw that it was a pair of silk 
underwear. The throbbing between her legs increased as she thought of 
Usa naked under the covers.
        She attempted to step forward, but was stopped again by Usa. 
&quot;Odango-chan&quot; she called out frustrated. Usa just giggled at her 
friend, then commanded her to strip. Hotaru starred wide eyed in 
surprise at Usa&#39;s request, but the increased throbbing between her legs 
convinced her to follow the princesses orders. Usa watched as Hotaru 
first pulled off her shirt, then her black pants, her socks, her bra, 
and finally her underwear. She stood there naked in front of her 
friend. Usa noticed something shiny on Hotaru&#39;s inner thighs, and 
smiled wickedly. &quot;Come here&quot; she commanded innocently.
        Hotaru walked quickly to the bed, and pulled back the covers. 
Usa let out a laughing scream. Hotaru starred in amazement. She had 
seen Usa naked before on certain occasions, but never had she looked as 
beautiful as she did now lying naked on the bed. Hotaru leaned down, 
and kissed the princess on her lips, Usa wrapped her arms around Hotaru 
drawing her friend closer. Their tongues played in each other&#39;s mouths 
and they moaned softly against one another. Hotaru&#39;s hands began 
exploring Usa&#39;s body. She began kneading her breasts, bringing a 
delighted moan from Usa. Hotaru pulled away, breaking the kiss, and 
went down to Usa&#39;s neck. She began sucking on the skin, and 
occasionally grazing her teeth against it. Usa loved it, and held 
Hotaru&#39;s head there.
        From her neck, Hotaru began a trail down to Usa&#39;s breasts. She 
licked at the swollen, hard nipples, and suckled one in her mouth. The 
pleasure was overwhelming for Usa, and she moaned in delight.  Never 
had she felt anything so good. She could feel her juices running onto 
her thighs, and began instinctively thrusting her pelvis. Hotaru loved 
the reaction, and began to gently nip at the nipple with her teeth. 
This brought even louder moans from the princess, and Hotaru could feel 
herself getting more and more excited. She raised her head from the 
first nipple, bringing a frustrated moan from Usa, but then moved onto 
the other, and began teasing it in the same way.
        Usa couldn&#39;t take it anymore. Her eyes squeezed shut as she 
screamed out Hotaru&#39;s name. Hotaru moved back up to Usa&#39;s face, as the 
orgasm wracked the moon princess&#39;s body. When the pleasure had 
subsided, she kissed her lover deeply. She moved her body, so that they 
rolled over. Usa was now on top, and it was her turn to play with 
Hotaru. Usa smiled wickedly, and began massaging Hotaru&#39;s smaller 
breasts. Hotaru moaned out Usa&#39;s name and closed her eyes, giving 
herself up to the pleasure. Usa brought the pebble like nipples to her 
mouth and began sucking and licking them. Hotaru&#39;s moans became 
steadily louder as Usa had her fun. Then an idea occurred in her. She 
could keep doing this and bring Hotaru to orgasm, but that would be 
boring. She wanted to make Hotaru totally lose herself, and she knew 
just how to do it.
        She rose up from the bed, and moved to the foot of it. Hotaru&#39;s 
eyes opened and she looked down at Usa in confusion. &quot;Odango&quot; she 
breathed out &quot;What are you...?&quot;
        &quot;Bend your legs&quot; was Usa&#39;s reply. Hotaru starred at her, not 
understanding what she meant. Usa repeated the command, only firmer. 
Hotaru silently obeyed and bent her legs so the knees were off the bed. 
Usa crawled seductively across the bed, and between Hotaru&#39;s parted 
legs. The smell of Hotaru&#39;s juices filled the room, and Usa licked her 
lips with apprehension. She leaned over, and began kissing Hotaru&#39;s 
flat strong stomach. Hm... all those crunches Haruka makes Hotaru do 
really paid off... she thought as she kissed around Hotaru&#39;s belly 
button. One hand began slowly playing with Hotaru&#39;s black pubic hair. 
Hotaru gasped as she felt how close Usa was to her most private part. 
She wanted more. Usa&#39;s hand began to travel downward, and she watched 
her lover&#39;s face, as she touched her swollen clit.
        It sent an electric shock through her body, and her pelvis 
lifted off the bed. She gasped loudly at the sudden surge of pleasure, 
and moaned for it to continue. Usa was shocked by the sudden reaction, 
but it only motivated her to perform more entertaining stunts. Her 
fingers moved down Hotaru&#39;s womanhood, to the moist opening. She began 
playing around it, going around in circles with one hand, while 
caressing Hotaru&#39;s inner thigh with the other. Hotaru&#39;s pleading moans 
became louder, as her body ached more and more for Usa&#39;s touch. Usa let 
one finger slide in, and began pumping it rhythmically into Hotaru. 
Hotaru began to move with the pumping, driving the finger deeper into 
her. Usa continued her assault by pushing another finger into Hotaru&#39;s 
virgin hole. A fire had begun in Hotaru&#39;s body, and with each minute it 
was growing more and more. She had begun calling out her lover&#39;s name, 
as sweat formed on her body. She grabbed the bed in support as Usa 
picked up her pace. Usa moved her head down to Hotaru&#39;s nub, and began 
to lick her lips. Just as Hotaru thought she couldn&#39;t take anymore, Usa 
grabbed the nub with her lips, and sucked hard on it.
        It was like electricity surging through her body. That single 
touch was enough to bring her to the most sensational orgasm that she 
could ever have. Her entire body lifted off the bed, and she screamed 
out Usa&#39;s name.. Her body was immediately wracked by powerful spasms, 
and all she could do was moan softly between them. Usa continued to 
pleasure her lover throughout the orgasm. She continued to pump her 
with her fingers, and began licking her swollen clit.
        When the feeling had finally ended, Hotaru looked down between 
her legs to see Usa smiling happily at her. She began a soundless 
laugh, and laid back into the pillows. Usa crawled up to her lover&#39;s 
face, and the two shared a passionate kiss. Hotaru could taste her 
juices throughout Usa&#39;s mouth, and she loved it. Just kissing her made 
her feel all warm again throughout her body, and the aching began 
again.
        She pulled her body up and leaned the weight against Usa, 
causing the princess to fall down on the bed. Usa wasn&#39;t quite sure 
what Hotaru was doing, but she didn&#39;t want to stop her. Hotaru used one 
knee to part Usa&#39;s legs, and settled between them. She broke off the 
kiss, and positioned herself over Usa. They both gasped as both their 
clits met together. Hotaru began to grind on Usa, rubbing their swollen 
nubs together. Usa pulled her lover&#39;s face down to meet hers, and the 
two kissed as they rubbed against each other. Hotaru&#39;s nipples rubbed 
against Usa&#39;s and the girl moaned loudly into Hotaru&#39;s mouth. She 
quickened the pace of her grinding as she felt the orgasm building up. 
Hotaru moved her head down to Usa&#39;s neck, and bit her softly as the 
orgasm exploded with her. The pain and the pleasure was driving Usa 
mad, and her whole body wrapped around Hotaru as she screamed her name 
into the night.
        The two girls lay panting for air as the orgasms finally 
stopped. Hotaru had collapsed on top of Usa, and she nuzzled into Usa&#39;s 
neck. Usa&#39;s hand reached up, and she began running her fingers through 
Hotaru&#39;s silky shoulder-length black hair. The last thing heard before 
either girl drifted to sleep, was the other&#39;s mumbled &quot;aishiteru&quot;.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Hotaru awoke the next morning to the sweet sound of the ocean 
waves hitting the shore. She sat up in bed, and stretched. Looking back 
to the bed, she noticed that Chibi Usa was gone. Since when does she 
wake up before me?, she thought to herself. She shook her head, 
dismissing the thought, and got out of bed. She moved to the closet, 
and opened the doors looking for her mom&#39;s aqua colored robe. She 
frowned as she only saw her papa&#39;s navy blue one. She shrugged her 
shoulders and put the robe on. She was about ready to leave the room, 
when she heard a huge crash down the hall, followed by a loud scream. 
&quot;USA!&quot; she yelled, as she bolted out the door, and into the kitchen
        Smoke had filled the room, and Hotaru covered her mouth as she 
looked for her friend. Before she could get very far, she saw Usa 
waddling out the smoke, totally covered in the black soot. Hotaru ran 
to her, and pulled her out the kitchen into the hallway. She could see 
that Usa was crying, and was instantly concerned about her friend. 
&quot;Daijobu Chibi Usa?&quot; she asked, looking over Usa&#39;s body for bruises.
        Usa sniffled, and began to cry out. &quot;The stove exploded.&quot; She 
mumbled out between sobs. Hotaru suddenly went wide-eyed. &quot;N, nani?&quot; 
she asked. Chibi Usa continued to cry as she answered. &quot;I was tr, tr, 
trying to make you some breakfast. And the stove ex, ex, exploded.&quot; A 
huge sweat drop formed on Hotaru&#39;s brow. She looked down at her whining 
girlfriend, and burst into uncontrollable laughter. Usa saw this, and 
began laughing as well...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Odango-chan, breakfast is ready!&quot; Hotaru called out. After 
they had cleaned up the kitchen, it was decided that Hotaru would take 
care of the cooking... so that no other explosions occurred. Chibi Usa 
ran into the kitchen and quickly sat down at the table. Hotaru placed 
the tall plate of pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage and bacon in front 
of the princess. Usa&#39;s eyes went wide as she looked at all the food, 
and drool could be seen at the corner of her mouth. Hotaru laughed as 
she sat down in her own chair. &quot;How un-princess like Odango-chan.&quot; Usa 
gave her an evil stare, and stuck out her tongue in reply. Both girls 
laughed as they picked up their utensils. &quot;IKODEKIMASU!&quot; they yelled in 
unison, as they began eating.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Ahhh&quot; Usa sighed contently as she patted her full stomach. 
&quot;That was a great breakfast Taru-chan&quot;
        Hotaru smiled as she began washing the dishes. &quot;Arigato, Usa. 
I&#39;m glad all those hours spent with mama and Setsuna-mama learning to 
cook didn&#39;t go to waste.&quot;
        Usa got up from her chair, and walked over to Hotaru. She 
wrapped her arms around Hotaru&#39;s waist, and rested her head against her 
back. Hotaru smiled. Having Usa so close felt so right to her. It was 
something she&#39;d always wanted, she realized. The two had hugged plenty 
of times before, but it was different now. They were a couple, and 
would be together forever, Hotaru hoped.
        &quot;Ne, Taru-chan.&quot; Usa began. &quot;This is our last day alone 
together. What do you wanna do?&quot;
        Hotaru thought for a moment before replaying back. &quot;We don&#39;t 
have to do anything. I just wanna relax here, with you.&quot;
        Usa smiled. &quot;You&#39;re right. We have enough to do at home. We can 
just relax today, and spend time together.&quot;
        Hotaru cut off the water, and wiped her wet hands on the towel 
beside the sink. Usa released her hug, and walked over into the living 
room and turned on the television. Hotaru soon followed, and sat down 
on the couch beside the pink-headed girl. She put he arm around Usa&#39;s 
shoulder and pulled her closer. Usa nestled herself into Hotaru, and 
the two girls watched TV.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Haruka-chan, Michiru-chan, Setsuna-chan, what a pleasant 
surprise.&quot; Queen Serenity exclaimed as she saw the three women walk to 
the gazebo. The four other women eagerly greeted the three as well 
before they all sat down together.
        &quot;So&quot; Rei began. &quot;To what do we owe to this visit?&quot;
        &quot;It was too quiet around the house without Hotaru playing her 
music upstairs. We got kinda lonely.&quot; Haruka answered.
        &quot;And since we haven&#39;t seen you all for a while, we decided to 
come over a pay a visit.&quot; Michiru chimed in.
        &quot;Speaking of Hotaru&quot; Setsuna began. &quot;Have you heard from her or 
small lady?&quot;
        The queen shook her head from side to side. &quot;Iie. Not since 
they left together. I hope everything is all right with those two.&quot;
        Haruka covered her mouth as she snickered quietly. All the 
women turned to face her, and Michiru sighed as she raised her hand to 
her forehead. &quot;You must excuse Haruka&quot; Michiru said. &quot;She finds 
anything referring to Hotaru and Chibi Usa to be very funny.&quot;
        &quot;You mean about the two of them being a couple?&quot; Makoto asked. 
Michiru shook her head in affirmation. The five inner senshi smiled and 
shook their heads.
        &quot;Well they do make a very cute couple at least&quot; Ami stated.
        &quot;Well you got over the shock fast&quot; Makoto said surprised as she 
folded her arms. Ami blushed a little. &quot;We were all a little shocked at 
first. I mean, who would have thought that the two of them would ever 
get together like that?&quot; All the girls shook their heads.
        &quot;Yeah especially with that whole Helios thing&quot; Minako chimed in 
&quot;She seemed to have a big crush on him. I thought for sure that she 
liked guys.&quot;
        &quot;She also always went after my Mamo-chan&quot; Serenity inserted 
angrily as she crossed her arms in front of her. Sweat drops appeared 
on all the girl&#39;s heads as they thought back on those years.
        &quot;Oh Usagi&quot; Rei began. &quot;She was just probably doing that to get 
on your nerves. You two were always fighting like that.&quot; All eyes fell 
on Rei. &quot;Ahem&quot; Haruka coughed &quot;That sounds more like what you two do 
all the time.&quot; She pointed at Serenity and Rei. The two began 
scratching the back of their heads while they laughed loudly. The other 
women soon joined in the laughter as well.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;Odango-chan&quot;...
        &quot;Odango-chan&quot;...
        Usa&#39;s crimson eyes slowly opened to see Hotaru looking down at 
her. She blinked several times, then smiled at her lover. Hotaru smiled 
back and bent down to kiss her beautiful girlfriend. Their lips met in 
a soft kiss.
        &quot;Hmm, I thought you were never going to wake up Odango-chan.&quot; 
Hotaru said as she sat down next to her on the bed.
        Chibi Usa made a wide smile as she turned to look at the dark 
haired girl. &quot;You know, I can get used to waking up like this.&quot;
        Hotaru smiled at Usa. &quot;It&#39;s already one in the afternoon Usa, 
we should be leaving soon.&quot;
        Chibi Usa sat up in the bed letting go of her sheet so that her 
breasts were in full view. &quot;Do we have to leave so early Taru-chan? I 
don&#39;t want to go back to the palace so soon. I want to stay here with 
you.&quot; She wrapped her arms around Hotaru&#39;s waist and kissed her again. 
Hotaru began running her hand up and down Usa&#39;s back and through her 
soft pink hair.
        &quot;You have to get up now, Usa. By the time your actually ready 
to leave it&#39;ll be around four.&quot; Hotaru stood up from the bed, and moved 
to the doorway. Usa glared evilly at Hotaru. &quot;Mou, I don&#39;t take that 
long to get ready.&quot; Hotaru looked back at Usa and giggled. &quot;Yeah you 
do, now get up and into the shower. I&#39;ll start breakfast so it&#39;ll be 
done when you get out...&quot;
        &quot;I have a better idea&quot; Usa began while getting off the bed. She 
began walking towards Hotaru whose eyes were immediately drawn to her 
lover&#39;s naked body. &quot;How about we take that shower together?&quot; She 
stopped in front of Hotaru and wrapped her long arms around her neck, 
drawing her into a deep kiss.
        Hotaru smiled as Usa pulled away and took the other girl&#39;s 
hand. The two walked together into the bathroom.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        &quot;So, how did you two enjoy your vacation?&quot; Serenity asked the 
two girls. All ten scouts sat outside in the garden talking together.
        &quot;It was great. I really needed to get out of this palace for a 
while, and being with Hotaru just made everything better.&quot; Usa looked 
to the side and smiled lovingly at Hotaru. Hotaru smiled back with the 
same love in her eyes.
        The eye contact didn&#39;t escape notice from the other scouts, and 
all the girls smiled a little as they looked at the two. Of course it 
was Haruka who began the giggling under her breath that woke the two 
girls from their gaze. She tried to cover it up as a cough, but with no 
success. Michiru just sighed as she covered her eyes with her hand and 
shook her head.
        &quot;It&#39;s getting late, we should be getting back home.&quot; Setsuna 
said, addressing the other three outter senshi. They rose from their 
seats and walked back into the palace.
        &quot;It was good to see you four again. You really should come over 
more often, it&#39;s rare to have us all together in one place at one 
time.&quot; Serenity said as they walked to through the main lobby. &quot;Arigato 
Serenity Sama, we&#39;ll come back again soon.&quot; Michiru replied as they 
approached the door...
        Behind everyone, Chibi Usa and Hotaru walked along the corridor 
hand in hand. Usa turned to face Hotaru as they reached the door. &quot;Call 
me when you get home, ne?&quot; she asked the taller girl. Hotaru smiled and 
assured her that she would They stood looking at one another until 
Haruka called for Hotaru to come on. All the women stood standing in 
the doorway watching the two girls together. Hotaru brought her hand up 
to lift Chibi Usa&#39;s chin and placed her lips onto Usa&#39;s. The other 
women just starred, wide-eyed at the two kissing girls. As she felt 
Hotaru&#39;s lips leave hers, Usa could feel her face redden at the thought 
of her whole family seeing them kiss. Hotaru saw her girlfriend&#39;s face 
and smiled sweetly. She bent down to Usa&#39;s ear and whispered 
&quot;aishiteru&quot; before walking to the door. She walked past the others and 
outside to her car.
        After regaining consciousness, the three outer senshi proceeded 
outside to Haruka&#39;s red convertible, all except for Haruka who walked 
over to Hotaru&#39;s black car. &quot;You got some explaining to do when we get 
home Taru-chan.&quot; She said as she bent down to Hotaru&#39;s window. The two 
laughed, and Haruka walked to her own car. When the others had left, 
all eyes fell on Chibi Usa. The princess stretched her arms over her 
head and yawned. &quot;You know, I&#39;m feeling really tired right now. I&#39;ll 
see you all tomorrow. Oyasumi.&quot; She called out as she quickly ran away 
to her bedroom.
