<h1>Sailor Moon: Minerva (part 1 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<pre>-Kanto, Japan, 1923-

The group of men and women gathered in the castle basement as the four 
nude women finished drawing the chalk designs on the floor. The castle, 
dating back to the Edo period, looked from the outside to be dead at 
this time of night. The candles and incense burning inside, however, 
told otherwise.

As the one nude acolyte finished drawing out the circle in the center of 
the room and a second was finishing up inscribing the combination of 
Japanese, Greek and Hebrew letters around a triangle drawn outside the 
circle, the other two women left. The group of men and women who had 
been observing all silently now began to disrobe. As the last article of 
clothing was discarded, the two acolytes returned with large jars of ink 
and brushes. They began to write and paint talismans and other occult 
symbols on the group.

Meanwhile, the first two acolytes stood up and left the rooms to obtain 
the tools for the ritual, returning a short time later with a small 
table alter on which a double-sided blade, a long wooden rod, and 
several small whips were laying.

The oldest member present, a man in his late forties who was slowly 
balding, addressed his twelve companions.

&quot;Ladies and gentleman.&quot; he began, an upside-down pentagram recently 
brushed onto his forehead in black ink, &quot;What we are about to try has 
never been attempted before. We are about to attempt to create a 
dimensional vortex that will bridge the gap between the world of the 
seen and the unseen. Natsu here,&quot; he said, motioning to the young woman 
who&#39;d just finished inscribing the last of the three other acolytes with 
the ink-drawn hieroglyphs and who herself had none on her bare flesh, 
&quot;Has agreed to be the sacrifice.&quot;

All turned and bowed reverently to Natsu. The young maiden bowed back.

&quot;As you know, the ancient Syrian texts speak of an ancient kingdom on 
the moon, and princesses who ruled over the planets of the solar system. 
Other ancient tomes speak of a future golden age when these young 
princesses will be reincarnated to create a utopia, and men and women 
will never die. We have waited for this momentous eon long enough! 
Tonight, we force the hand of fate. We will bring about the incarnations 
of the princesses through the ritual we perform tonight. So it shall 
be!&quot;

&quot;So it shall be!&quot; the others shouted.

A half hour later, The circle was full of the sounds of whips smacking 
against flesh as eleven of the thirteen present, whips in hand, 
self-flagellated themselves while chanting ancient forbidden words over 
and over again. The youngest acolyte, Natsu, lay on the small alter with 
her arms and legs dangling off and touching the floor. As a steady spray 
of blood from the flagellators fell to the floor and the sacrifice 
closed her eyes, the High Priest held his knife high, staring intently 
at the now glowing triangle in front of the circle. With every painful 
lash of the whip, the others released more and more energy, willing it 
all over to the High Priest. A dark blue mist of pure kinetic energy 
began to whirl around the participants within the circle, as static 
electricity caused tiny sparks to go off and everyone&#39;s hair to stand on 
end.

Finally, as a small sphere of pure white light formed in the center of 
the triangle and levitated in midair five feet above the ground, the 
magus spoke.

&quot;We command you open.&quot; he said, now gripping the knife above his head 
with both hands, &quot;We command you , dimensional gates, open! We command 
you, gates of time, open! We command you open!&quot;

A sudden downward thrust, followed by a high pitched scream, signaled 
the climax of the ritual. All stopped whipping themselves to look down 
at the sacrifice. The knife was still resting in her heart as blood 
sprayed out and ran in little rivers down her chest and arms onto the 
stone floor. Her lifeless eyes stared off blankly up at the ceiling as 
her mouth hung open. Members of the group then turned from the ghastly 
sight to look at the orb of light within the triangle, which was growing 
brighter and larger by the second.

The magus smirked at the orb as it continued to enlarge, &quot;Oh fates, O 
old gods, we call upon you to...&quot; he stopped when he saw something 
disturbing. The light, which was slowly taking on a purple color, was 
now expanding outside the confines of the triangle. A woman&#39;s form 
appeared within the light, holding a staff with a garnet orb near the 
top of it.

The others within the circle looked fearfully from the form within the 
triangle to their High Priest, hoping he knew what was happening or at 
least was still in control. The sheer terror evident in his face, 
however, left little doubt that he was just as frightened as the others. 
Trying to regain some measure of control over the proceedings, he 
stumbled over to where the wand was lying on the floor and pointed it at 
the apparition.

&quot;I...In the name of... of the Tetragrammaton, I... I com... mand you, 
to... to...&quot;

The woman scowled at him and the others within the circle as she pointed 
her own staff back, causing the High Priest to drop his wand in fear.

&quot;Dead Scream!&quot; she shouted.

All within the circle were sent hurdling out of it into the back wall, 
the sacrificed young woman flopping like a rag doll against the wall and 
down to the floor. The circle, now broken, released massive amounts of 
dark magikal energy which, combined with the woman&#39;s scream, caused a 
devastating chain reaction as the ground began to shake and the walls 
collapsed on the magicians.

In all, some one hundred and forty thousand men, women and children died 
during the Great Kanto Earthquake of September first, nineteen 
twenty-three. Most were claimed by the earthquake itself, while others 
were killed by the fire caused by it. It is remembered to this day as 
one of the worst earthquakes in human history.

To this day, only one person is even aware of the story behind the 
disaster. And even now, after all these years, it still haunts her.

&quot;Setsuna-mama, are you okay?&quot;

Meiou Setsuna sat across the breakfast table from her adopted daughter 
Tomoe Hotaru and smiled sadly. &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m fine, I guess.&quot; she said, 
clutching onto her coffee mug.

Hotaru tilted her head a bit as she studied the Senshi of Time. &quot;No, 
you&#39;re not.&quot; she said as she put her spoon back in her cereal bowl. She 
got out of her chair and walked over to Setsuna&#39;s side of the table. She 
gave her Setsuna-mama a warm, loving hug. &quot;I don&#39;t know what&#39;s wrong, 
but I&#39;m here for you if you need me.&quot;

Setsuna smiled affectionately at Hotaru as she returned the hug. &quot;I 
know.&quot; she said, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Just then, a doorbell broke up the tender mother-daughter moment, 
followed by the front door opening.

&quot;Hello!&quot; a familiar husky voice called out, &quot;Where is everyone?&quot;

&quot;Haruka-Papa!&quot; Hotaru called out. Rushing from the kitchen, she 
practically tackled the sandy-blond racecar driver. Tenoh Haruka, who 
was still holding onto two pieces of luggage at the time, practically 
had the wind knocked out of her.

&quot;Oof. Hey, easy firefly. Wait until I set the bags down at least.&quot; she 
joked. As Hotaru let her go and took her luggage up to her parent&#39;s room 
for her, Haruka turned around to go back out and get more. Setsuna came 
into the living room just as Haruka&#39;s wife Kaioh Michiru entered 
carrying two bags of her own.

&quot;Here, let me help you with that.&quot; Setsuna offered, taking the bags from 
the violinist. &quot;So how did your third anniversary trip go?&quot; she asked.

&quot;Oh, where to begin.&quot; Michiru began with a smile, &quot;We went to Australia, 
performed a duet at the Sydney Opera House...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s funny,&quot; Setsuna broke in, &quot;I didn&#39;t even realize the two of you 
could sing.&quot;

&quot;Har har, very funny.&quot; Haruka said from the door. She was carrying two 
more cases in as Hotaru came bounding down the stairs.

&quot;Michiru-mama!&quot; she squealed as she hugged the aqua-haired beauty. &quot;How 
was your trip?&quot;

&quot;I was just telling Setsuna-mama here all about it. We played a concert, 
went on a tour of the outback, and had a romantic weekend at the hotel 
we stayed at.&quot;

&quot;And we received a rather interesting call from Ami.&quot; Haruka added.

Both Setsuna and Hotaru noted the change in tone of Haruka&#39;s voice. 
&quot;Papa?&quot; Hotaru asked tentatively, &quot;What is it, what&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;She called to inform us about a recent press conference presided over 
by something called the International Astronomical Union.&quot; Michiru said 
in a low tone, &quot;Apparently, they believe they&#39;ve discovered a tenth 
planet.&quot;</pre>
