<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ldreamer.html">Lady Dreamer</a><br> </h2>
<pre> The crystal palace was a beautiful place. A kingdom that rose out 
of the earth like a splintered silver diamond, glittering magically 
in the distance and cold and barren to the looks.
 The kingdom had come into existence a few years after the defeat 
of the Chaos. On a far away and distant planet, a tribe of natives 
who honored Queen Beryl as their goddess, used an evil spell to 
bring her back from the dead.
 Angered and driven by madness, the wicked Queen thundered off to 
Earth and encased it in a ice shell putting the Earth&#39;s people into 
sleep for thousands of years before the Sailor Soldiers could 
attack her. But if it wasn&#39;t for the supreme power of Sailor Moon, 
who, on the anniversary of the Moon Kingdom&#39;s destruction, 
magically thundered out of the ice that covered the Earth and 
reawaked it with the power of the silver crystal, the planet and 
it&#39;s people would still be sleeping. With herself alone, Sailor 
Moon destroyed the evil Queen and thus she becomes the new ruler of 
the Earth, Neo-Queen Serenity.
 Her days as Sailor Moon were over.
 So now she and Darien ruled over the Earth as King and Queen, the 
people excepting their rein as thanks for being saved from the ice.
But under the royal facade however, a young girl, a Princess, felt 
loneness, as she had never felt before.  Silent, Princess Rini sat 
on the steps of the palace gardens, watching the rainfall down 
around her, and listening to the wind howl.
 &quot;Rini?&quot; came her mother&#39;s voice.
 The girl looked slightly over her shoulder at the appearance of 
her mother, than looked away. &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, dreamingly, 
sadly.
 &quot;What is it mother?&quot;  In her white silk gown, the older woman with 
long gold hair walked up to her child and joined her on the steps.
She sighed, smiled and looked out at the rain.
 &quot;It&#39;s beautiful isn&#39;t it?&quot; she gestured to the rain.
 &quot;Before the crystal palace I don&#39;t believe I ever saw rain as 
beautiful and clean as this.&quot; Rini didn&#39;t answer, just looked away 
sadly, sighing under her breath.
 &quot;Mother,&quot; she asked finally, looking up at her parent with sad 
eyes.
 &quot;When I was living in the past, I---I,&quot; she laughed softly.
 &quot;I missed you and daddy so much.&quot; 
 &quot;I can understand that darling.&quot; Said her mother warmly, hugging 
her child.
 Muttering a sob, the young girl accepted the motherly grasp, 
letting herself be rocked back and forward in her mother&#39;s lap.
Tears formed at the younger girl&#39;s eyes, the next time she spoke it 
all came out in a rush.
 &quot;But now I miss Hotaru!&quot; she burst into tears, and her mother 
continued to rock her, soothing her as a mother should. 
 &quot;Oh, my darling I understand. You miss your friend,&quot;
 &quot;A huh!&quot; breathed the girl, now letting her tears freely flow.
 &quot;I---I want to see her again mother, I---&quot; 
 &quot;Shosh,&quot; Rini&#39;s mother handed her a locket, a little pink and red 
locket.
 &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; asked Rini entranced, sitting upwards and looking 
over the thing in wonder. Even though she wanted her daughter to 
stay with her so much, Serena knew she must let her walk her own 
path.
 &quot;It&#39;s your way back into the past!&quot; she said, trying to smile and 
not to cry.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Alone in her room, Hotaru sat on her bed quiet, legs pressed up 
against her chest, hands grasping her knees and rocking back and 
forward.
 Hot tears glittered down her checks.
 &quot;I miss her,&quot; the horse whisper shivered frightfully past the 
girl&#39;s lips.
 Looking away, the younger girl felt her heart cry out at the lost 
of a friend, maybe more--
 &quot;I miss Rini&#133;&quot; Suddenly there was a burst of light in her room and 
a vortex opened before her. Gasping, Hotaru nearly fell off her bed 
startled. Finally regaining her pose, the young girl grasped her 
Saturn wand ready to defend herself when a familiar figure 
stepped outwards from the vortex&#133;.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hotaru gasped.
 Rini gasped.
 For what seemed forever to the two girls stared at each other 
shocked, than screamed and ran to each other.
 &quot;Hotaru!&quot; 
 &quot;Rini!&quot; Racing into each other&#39;s arms the two girls kissed.
 Unexceptionally the kiss came, but neither girl came to break it.
Soon their tongues began to entangle, hands began to creep around 
their bodies.
 Parting for a moment, the two girls looked at each other panting, 
slightly shocked.
 But after a moment they kissed again, passionately and lovingly.
They fell onto the bed, delicately but delicately running their 
hands over each other&#39;s body, unwrapping one another like china 
dolls of their clothes.
 They kissed again, a kiss of fire, of ice. Muttering breaths of 
delight, Hotaru ran her fingers here and there throughout Rini&#39;s 
hair. Lying under her new lover, Rini smiled and trembled 
anxiously.
 &quot;---Hotaru!&quot; she yelped.
 Leaning very close to her, Hotaru whispered darkly in the other 
girl&#39;s ear.
 &quot;Let me pleasure you, my friend&#133;.&quot; She licked her. Running her 
tongue in a slippery motion around Rini&#39;s ear. Rini jerked, 
shuddered and smiled.
 &quot;Ahh---yes, keep---keep going my---my friend&#133;.&quot; 
 Hotaru ran her tongue down onto the other girl&#39;s chest. Leaning on 
top of her lover, Hotaru rubbed her womanhood hungrily against 
Rini&#39;s as she ran her tongue in circles round Rini&#39;s perk breasts.
Rini startled to cry out, &quot;Ahh---yes!&quot; her voice was frantic.
In desire, she arched her head far back.
 &quot;Keep going,&quot; she hoarsely whispered.  &quot;Keep going.&quot;
 Panting, Hotaru ran her out-stretched hands down Rini&#39;s chest, 
causing Rini to jerk once more, than shudder. Hotaru began to lick 
with her tongue again, kissing Rini&#39;s womanhood at first in soft 
little kisses, than licking at it furiously, diving her tongue deep 
into it&#39;s warm flesh, swirling it around and around. Both girl&#39;s 
soon began to scream, reaching upwards to hug and kiss each other 
hungrily. Calling out each other&#39;s name the two girls&#39; held each 
other close, their naked flesh wet with sweat, and pressed hard 
against each other. For a long moment they were both silent, tears 
of pure joy glittering down their checks.
 Leaning forward, Hotaru softly whispered in Rini&#39;s ear.
 &quot;I love you.&quot; Hugging close to her friend---her lover, Rini smiled 
and tried not to cry out in tears of happiness.
 &quot;And I&#39;ve always loved you Hotaru.&quot;
