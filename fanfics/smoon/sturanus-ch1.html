<h1>Senshi Thoughts: Uranus</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<pre>As your body crashes to the ground in front of me, I am confronted 
with five instantaneous visions. Rei-chan, pinned to a wall, her body 
lifeless; Mako-chan, betrayed and alone, on the ground of the Marine 
Park; Ami-chan, thrust into a wall, slumped and defeated; Usagi-chan, 
her life, her very radiance drawn out by Kaolinite; and Minako-chan, 
that day we learned each other&#146;s identities, her heart crystal shining 
so obscenely in the gloom of the parking deck.

And at that moment I realize that I would gladly have sacrificed them 
all - even brilliant, radiant, Odango Atama - I would gladly let the 
world come to Silence and Chaos, if only you would return to me.

But you won&#146;t. You&#146;ve left me alone, as I always knew you would.

She&#146;s laughing at me, taunting me, but I don&#146;t care. Death will be a 
blessing and she can say anything she wants, just as long as she 
shoots me and lets me follow you.

When that voice breaks through the spell, I&#146;m angry at her for 
interrupting, for delaying my return to you. And then it happens - a 
vision of redemption and solace, a vision I know I am not worthy of. I 
reject it, and with it, any hope of life.

I remember when Minako, innocent of my role, asked me if I missed 
having an ordinary life. What did I answer? I told her that I had 
something more important. But that was not the whole truth. I do not 
know what she meant by an ordinary life. I have no idea what it means 
to be ordinary. Is it something I should miss? All I know is that I 
have failed.

I cannot do what I was meant to do, what must be done. Maybe...maybe 
in my death, the world can be saved, as I could not do in my life. 
Maybe, she can save everyone else, because I know she can&#146;t save me. 
It&#39;s too late. You&#146;re already gone.
