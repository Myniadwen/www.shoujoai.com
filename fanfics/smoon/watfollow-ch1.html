------------------------------------------------------------

These letters flashed before Hino Rei&#39;s eyes the moment she picked up 
the newspaper. She smiled to herself, as she deduced Ami again topped 
some academic competition for being in the papers. Rei grunted a bit, 
as other commuters for the subway began pushing behind her. 

&quot;I knew I should&#39;ve walked...&quot; Rei mumbled to herself. She dug her 
hand into her pocket, pulling out a couple of coins, then tossed it 
over to the old newspaper vendor. 

&quot;Hey, kid! You still have some change!&quot; called out the old man to the 
young raven-haired girl who was rushing off for her ride, as he 
counted her payment for the newspaper. 

Rei quickly looked behind her, shaking her head abruptly. 

&quot;You keep it!&quot; she managed to answer before the train she got on 
closed. 

The old man sighed, shaking his head. He turned to the coins that came 
from the young woman. A smile slowly formed on his face, as he 
whispered, &quot;My lucky day.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Pale hands held a piece of cake, which slowly motioned towards a 
mouth. 

&quot;Hey, that looks pretty tasty!&quot;, hinted Tsukino Usagi, who suddenly 
appeared out of nowhere. Kino Makoto closely followed behind her, a 
cheery smile on her face. 

Mizuno Ami, smiled a bit, putting her cake down as she turned to her 
friends. Greeting them quite casually, Ami gestured to the two to have 
a seat with her. Usagi giddily sat opposite to Ami, asking her 
permission to wolf down her friend&#39;s dessert. Ami could only chuckle, 
nodding to her friend. 

&quot;Ne, Usagi-chan? Haven&#39;t you had too much cake for today?&quot;, asked 
Makoto. 

Usagi could only gurgle, because of the food that was deposited into 
her mouth. Sweatdrops formed both on Ami and Makoto&#39;s heads. 

&quot;Looks like Usagi-chan already went through Mako-chan&#39;s food...&quot;, she 
thought, as she saw the food stains on the blonde&#39;s school uniform. 
Ami&#39;s blue eyes went on looking absently at Usagi, having her head 
flooded with thoughts, as usual. 

Makoto coughed, pulling the young genius from her train of thought. 
Ami looked back at Makoto, an awkward smile on her face. The brunette 
just shook her head and smiled back. 

&quot;Oh, Ami-chan, I almost forgot!&quot;, exclaimed Makoto. Ami and Usagi 
blinked, puzzled as Makoto started rummaging through the contents of 
her bag, looking for something. The brunette then pulled out a neatly 
folded newspaper, handing it to Ami. 

&quot;Aww, and I thought it was another treat.&quot;, Usagi purred, which made 
the two other girls giggle. The blue-haired girl, absently unfolded 
the newspaper as Makoto watched her intently. Usagi, who by then 
finished eating, went behind Ami&#39;s shoulder to take a look at the 
newspaper. 

Finishing with the unfolding of the newspaper, Ami&#39;s eyes went wide as 
she read her name on the newspaper. Usagi squinted for a moment, as if 
taking some time to take in what she was reading. Makoto just smiled 
as she held out a hand for Ami. 

&quot;Congratulations. You won two tickets for a niceeeeee, and most 
importantly, FREE one-week vacation to the Winter Festival!&quot;, Makoto 
almost squeeled as she excitedly took Ami&#39;s hand, shaking it 
vigorously. 

&quot;WAAAAAAAAAAAAAI! AMI-CHAN!! YOU&#39;RE SO LUCKY!!!&quot;, squeeled Usagi, 
being more successful than Makoto in doing so. The blonde practically 
threw herself at the blue-haired girl, who was still in shock. 

Finally snapping out of her shock, Ami just smiled her usual shy and 
reserved smile. The difference was that her pale cheeks were streaming 
with a tint of red. 

Stammering, Ami explained, &quot;Uhm...thank you, I really don&#39;t know what 
to say...I just joined that contest because I got the raffle ticket 
when I bought a couple of books...&quot; The genius was at a loss for 
words. Makoto then stood up from her seat, going behind Ami, and laid 
both of her hands on her shoulders. Ami&#39;s face became redder, as the 
brunette&#39;s hands began massaging her back. She looked up at her 
friend, who had an expectant smile on her face. 

&quot;Of course, we now would like to know who you WOULD be taking.&quot;, 
Makoto chimed, the hint evident in her voice. 

Usagi&#39;s ears pricked up, and she went behind Ami. The blue-haired 
girl&#39;s eye widened as Usagi began to pat her back, in gentle massage. 
Makoto stared gravely at Usagi, who stuck out a tongue in retaliation. 

&quot;Yes, Ami-chan, I would also like to know.&quot;, Usagi piped in, hinting 
also very evident in her voice, ignoring the brunette now. 

Ami felt like she was about to die. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Ami still felt like she was about to die. She, Makoto, Usagi, and Aino 
Minako, who magically appeared besides the fact she was absent from 
school, nursing the flu; were heading for Rei&#39;s place. She walked 
mechanically along the street, as three of her friends now argued over 
who will be the distinguished companion of hers. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you have a lot of school work to catch up to, Usagi-chan?&quot;, 
commented Minako, that was immediately followed by a sneeze. 

&quot;At least I am not the one sneaking away from home when the doctor 
told me to stay in bed.&quot;, teased Usagi, who then received a death 
glare from Minako. 

&quot; I should come with Ami.&quot;, proclaimed Makoto. &quot;Afterall, I would be 
less of a burden compared if she was going to bring anyone else among 
you.&quot; Her green-eyes sparkled as she thought that of her waltzing 
across the snow-covered streets filled with festivities, and of 
course, cute men. 

Which was interrupted when the brunette had a pair of maddened blondes 
practicing their judo on her. 

Ami was lost in her own thoughts. Her head was down, barely hearing 
the noise her friends were making in the background. Then she stopped 
dead on her tracks, the other three bumping behind her. 

&quot;Oww!&quot;, Makoto, Minako, and Usagi all said in unison. They all stared 
at Ami, who looked like someone drained of all blood. The young girl 
was staring at the Hikawa shrine. Like a statue, she stood there, 
seemingly not breathing nor blinking. The other three looked at each 
other, and then at Ami. 

Makoto went in front of Ami, waving a hand in front of her face. No 
response. 

Usagi joined Makoto, and she poked the blue-haired girl on the chest. 
Still no response. 

Minako coughed into her fist, calling the attention of the other two. 
An evil smile formed on her face. 

Ami blinked, finally showing indications of life, as she felt a sudden 
breeze flowing beneath her skirt. She looked behind her, and saw 
Minako, whose smile was far too suspicious for her own comfort. The 
blonde also was holding a familiar blue fabric. 

&quot;Minako, isn&#39;t that...???&quot; 

Minako was raising the back of Ami&#39;s skirt high up in the air, with 
her underwear exposed for everyone to see. 

&quot;MINAKOOOOOOOO!!&quot;, Ami shrieked as she snatched her skirt back from 
the mischievous blonde. The other two almost fell to ground in sheer 
laughter. 

&quot;Geez, Ami-chan! Rei&#39;s place is a temple, not a haunted house! So 
chill out!&quot;, Minako said to Ami, giving her a pat on the back. Usagi 
was holding back her laughter, only to be replaced with loud snorting. 
A hiccup came from Makoto, who was laughing too much for her own good. 
All Ami could do at the moment was to gather back her poise as she 
puffed and wheezed from embarrassment. 

The blonde with odangos went ahead of the others, still snorting, and 
yelled back, &quot;C&#39;mon, we don&#39;t want to keep Rei-chan waiting!&quot; 

Makoto and Minako shrugged, and followed their sugar-overdosed friend. 
Ami, however, took another glance at the Hikawa shrine. She felt blood 
pulsing behind her ears. 

Sighing to herself, Ami went on to run after her friends who were 
almost halfway through the shrine&#39;s steps. 

------------------------------------------------------------

The four girls sat along beside the low table, waiting for their 
hostess. Rei had just finished her chores in the shrine, and was away 
preparing their snacks. Usagi began complaining on how hungry she was, 
with her head on the table, groaning too loudly for everyone&#39;s 
comfort. Minako had stuck a rolled ball of tissues into her nose to 
keep it from running. Makoto was consulting Ami on an assignment she 
has. 

&quot;What&#39;s taking Rei-chan so long?&quot;, Usagi asked, as she rubbed her 
stomach that was staging another revolution. Makoto and Minako looked 
at each other, and bursted into giggles almost at the same time. 

&quot;Whatcha two laughin&#39; at?&quot;, Usagi sneered. The girl picked up a pillow 
and threw it over at the two. The two ducked at the right time and was 
able to avoid the pillow of death. Ami leaned to the right absently, 
having the pillow just whiz to her side. 

&quot;Hey, I&#39;m sorry to kee...&quot; 

Rei came in. 

&quot;MFFFFT!&quot; 

Rei got hit by the pillow on her face. 

&quot;GRAAAAAGH!&quot; 

Rei dropped the cookies, glasses, tray, and ice cold pitcher of 
lemoned tea. 

&quot;SHIIIIIIEEEEEEEEEEEEET!&quot; 

Rei gets the tray and pitcher slam on her foot, and ice cold lemoned 
spilled on her shirt. 

&quot;..USAGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEH!&quot; 

And Rei went fuming mad, reaching out for Usagi&#39;s throat. 

&quot;Oops.&quot; 

The tissue balls popped out from Minako&#39;s nose as she choked on 
laughter. Makoto rolled like a large doughnut along the floor, howling 
in laughter like there was no tomorrow. Usagi was trying to crawl 
under the low table to hide. Ami froze, staring at Rei, who was as red 
on the face as her fuku when she&#39;s in the form of Sailor Mars. 

Rei lunged at Usagi, who managed to squeeze herself beneath the low 
table. Like a cat clawing for a mouse hiding in its hole, the fuming 
girl reached for the panicking blonde. Good thing for her other three 
have recovered from the initial shock of the accident and was trying 
to hold Rei from eating her alive. 

As soon as things calmed down, the five girls settled onto their 
seats. Rei and Usagi sat on the opposite sides of the table. Ami said 
it was to keep their princess safe. The priestess&#39; purple eyes still 
showed a glint of annoyance, while the blonde&#39;s glinted 
apologetically. The other blonde, Minako, was lying flat on her back 
on the floor, feeling woozy from her flu. Makoto had just finished 
cleaning up the mess and Ami was setting aside Rei&#39;s soiled clothes. 

Seeing that nobody else would speak up, Makoto sighed. &quot;Okay...&quot;, she 
started. &quot;Rei-chan, are you aware that Ami has...&quot; 

The other girl nodded. She then turned to Ami, who was just seated 
right beside her. 

&quot;Congratulations, Ami-chan.&quot;, Rei remarked, finally smiling for the 
first time after the ruckus. The blue-haired girl smiled back, nodding 
her head in thanks. 

&quot;Well I see someone is not interested in coming with Ami.&quot;, Minako 
said impishly, as she dragged herself up from lying. Nobody seemed to 
notice Ami bite her lower lip. 

Rei blinked, rather dumbly. &quot;Coming? Where is she going?&quot;, she asked. 

&quot;So you don&#39;t know?&quot;, asked Usagi, as her eyes widened in disbelief. 

All eyes were on Rei. The girl just shook her head. &quot;Didn&#39;t she win an 
academic contest of some sort?&quot;, she asked. 

&quot;She did win a contest, but it doesn&#39;t involve school this time.&quot;, 
explained the burly brunette, as she put her arms to the back of her 
neck. 

&quot;I won two tickets for the Winter Festival, Rei-chan.&quot;, Ami replied, 
trying to sound cheery. Rei&#39;s jaw dropped. 

&quot;Well don&#39;t I feel stupid..&quot;, Rei thought. 

&quot;And she&#39;d be taking...&quot;, Usagi followed. Everyone&#39;s eyes turned to 
Ami now. 

Ami tilted her head down, staring at the table. A hush filled the 
room, as everyone waited for the girl&#39;s answer. 

&quot;I&#39;d be taking...&quot; 

Everyone&#39;s heart was at their throats. Rei&#39;s jaw was still hanging 
from her face. 

&quot;...Rei-chan.&quot; 

The three other jaws joined Rei&#39;s. Purple eyes bulged out of the 
priestess&#39; sockets. 

Before anyone else could ask why, Ami explained, &quot;I just thought that, 
Rei-chan took me along the cruise years back, so...I decided to show 
her my gratitude.&quot; 

Everyone turned to Rei now. 

&quot;Are you even interested to come?&quot;, Minako asked the motionless, 
shocked to the bone Rei. Usagi was on the verge of tears, while Makoto 
was just staring blankly at Ami. The blue-haired girl avoided the 
brunette&#39;s eyes by turning to look at the still dumbfounded priestess. 

&quot;Well I...&quot;, Rei managed to regain her poise. She turned to Ami, who 
answered with an expectant smile on her face. 

&quot;I guess, I&#39;ll be coming then!&quot; 

Ami nodded at Rei, and everyone else groaned. 

&quot;It&#39;s settled then. Thank you, Rei-chan.&quot;, said Ami, as she gave her 
raven-haired friend a tight hug. Makoto looked away, with an unusual 
smile on her face. 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;G&#39;nite, Usa-chan!&quot;, Makoto waved on over to the blonde. She and Ami 
had already dropped Minako off at her place, and was seeing Usagi off 
to her home. Ami was waving gently over to their friend as she called 
out, &quot;Goodnight, Usagi-chan. Rest well!&quot; 

&quot;Yes, you too! Nite!&quot;, yelled Usagi as she waved out, before she 
kicked off her shoes and rushed inside her home, and closed the door 
behind her. 

The two headed off wordlessly away from their friend&#39;s house. Makoto 
stared straight ahead of the road, humming a familiar tune. Ami looked 
down as she walked, hands clasped together in front of her, holding 
her school bag. 

&quot;Come on, say it.&quot;, Ami said calmly. 

&quot;Say what?&quot;, answered Makoto, trying her best to sound innocent. Ami 
stopped walking, and looked at her friend, challenging blue eyes met 
green eyes. Makoto shook her head, sighing. 

&quot;Ami-chan, if you&#39;re really think you can go through with it, it&#39;s 
fine with me. Just remember, we&#39;re talking about Rei here.&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes 
softened, then looked away. 

&quot;I know...&quot;, Ami said, almost inaudible from her friend&#39;s ears. Makoto 
put an arm around her shoulder, and continued to walk off with Ami. 
She leaned down to the smaller girl&#39;s ear then whispered, &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry, Ami, I&#39;ll help you with what to do.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks, Mako-chan.&quot;, Ami said as she put on a weak smile on her face. 

&quot;She&#39;ll never know what hit &#39;er.&quot;, thought Makoto to herself. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Rei sat up from bed, rubbing her eyes groggily. She groped out for her 
clock, sending a few of her things tumbling off from her desk. 
&quot;Shit...I&#39;d better remind myself to get a wall clock...&quot;, she scowled. 
The raven-haired girl&#39;s eyes squinted, as pale light from the full 
moon streamed from her open window. 

&quot;Guess it&#39;s still too early.&quot;, Rei mumbled. She crawled out from her 
futon, hauling herself up from bed. Nights like this were not unusual 
for Rei. Waking up in the middle of night and spending the rest of it 
without sleep. It irritated her at times, but at some events it helped 
her relieve her mind, her soul. Sliding the door of her room to the 
side, Rei slipped into her slippers as she got out. She looked up in 
awe at the pale white brightness of the moon. The whole shrine grounds 
seemed illuminated under the moonlight, with the soft breeze gently 
whipping the tree branches. Everything seemed peaceful at that moment, 
and so did Rei&#39;s mind. She stood like a statue for a while, revelling 
in the beauty that was before her. This was one of her life&#39;s simple 
pleasures. 

Rei sat on the edge of the wooden flooring, then she looked up at the 
beautiful night sky. It was a clear night, the moon and all the stars 
were out, no clouds to get in their way. She shivered slightly, her 
loose white shirt not being much of help in the cold night. Long dark 
hair played with the wind, bringing with it coldness, much to the Fire 
Senshi&#39;s discomfort. Hugging herself tightly, she just sighed and 
said, &quot;Gotta get used to it, I guess.&quot; Rei let her eyes close, and she 
drifted on to her thoughts. 

Such a beautiful night, huh, Rei? 
Yeah. 
It&#39;d be more beautiful if you had someone to share it with. 
Yeah. 
Anyone in particular? 
No. 
Liar. 
You know why it is a &quot;No&quot;. 
Yeah, because you&#39;re such a tight-ass. 
Hmph...yeah. You&#39;re right, I am a tight-ass. 
Well it&#39;d be nice to get away for a few days. 
Uh-huh. Ami. 
She&#39;s nice, isn&#39;t she? 
Yep, really. I&#39;m glad she chose to take me along. 
Why? 
Because...I don&#39;t have to deal with thoughts like you while I&#39;m on 
vacation. 
Bitch. 

Rei kept her eyes closed, a smile tugging on her face. She could see 
Ami&#39;s blue eyes looking at her shyly, also somewhat, sadly. Ami with 
her reserved smile on, that sometimes looked like a facade over 
something that is not known to anyone. Rei thought even Ami didn&#39;t 
know about it. 

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot; 

&quot;Hmm?&quot; 

&quot;Is there anything bothering you?&quot; 

&quot;...no, of course not. Why do you ask?&quot; 

Deep blue eyes sparkled at Rei, and for once she thought the sadness 
in Ami passed. 

&quot;Nothing...nevermind.&quot; 

Gut instinct of a priestess, Rei always thought. She can sense things 
even the other senshi cannot feel. Gives her something special. 
Annoying at times though, because she felt she&#39;s the only one who can 
tell that something is not right, moreover with Ami. Makoto seemed to 
know, but she wouldn&#39;t tell Rei the truth about it. 

&quot;Makoto..?&quot; 

&quot;What, need help with those pastries?&quot; 

&quot;No...well, have you noticed something about Ami?&quot; 

&quot;Like...what?&quot; 

&quot;I dunno, she&#39;s like...hiding something. At first I thought I was 
imagining it but...it&#39;s, weird.&quot; 

&quot;Wow, Rei, you have some hope afterall!&quot; 

&quot;WHAT?!&quot; 

&quot;Hee, nothing. Come on, I&#39;ll help you carry those pastries before 
Usagi eats the others.&quot; 

Rei jerked her head back, then sneezed. Her pale hands reached over 
her frostbitten nose and rubbed it. It was getting too cold for her 
comfort. As she stood up from the edge of the wooden platform, she 
looked behind her, up at the full moon. Without even thinking, she 
told herself, &quot;I&#39;d better do my best to cheer Ami-chan up while we&#39;re 
in vacation then.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Makoto, what are THOSE?&quot;, Ami asked in disbelief. She stared at a 
pair of dark blue thongs, sheer enough that they cannot live up 
anymore to their original purpose. It wouldn&#39;t have been half so bad 
if Makoto wasn&#39;t so tall and noticeable while she held up the thong 
high in the air, with everyone in the lingerie store taking stares at 
them both. 

&quot;Slut underwear, Ami-chan.&quot;, Makoto said with a snicker. &quot;Rei will 
throw herself at you if she sees you in these.&quot; The beet red Ami 
snatched the thongs away from her friend, and stuffed it back from 
where it was hanging. The poor girl wished she had a paper bag along 
to hide her face with. 

&quot;I am NOT going to seduce Rei-chan...&quot;, Ami&#39;s voice was all raspy as 
she whispered to Makoto, as her extreme shyness taking the better of 
her. 

The taller woman just shrugged her shoulders. &quot;How else would you open 
up Rei&#39;s noggin, huh? Confession? I doubt it that you can tell that 
you are totally head over heels for her face to face, Ami. Aha! These 
are perfect!&quot;And so Makoto brandished the crotchless black underwear 
matched with silk teddies, high up in the air. Ami was sure that right 
now everyone was looking at them. 

&quot;And you can imagine me presenting myself to Rei-chan half-naked with 
a prostitute&#39;s attitude?!&quot;, Ami hissed as she tried to reach for the 
scandalous articles that were being held up by Makoto, well out of 
reach. 

&quot;No, but I can imagine you using that genius brain of yours to be so 
subtle in seducing Rei that you&#39;ll just find her asking you to be 
hers! 

Ami blinked, and stopped reaching for the underwear. She looked at 
Makoto, who had a suggestive smile on her face. 

&quot;You mean...&quot; 

&quot;Uh-huh.&quot; 

&quot;But I...&quot; &quot;Look, this is the best chance you have got. Everything is 
perfect!&quot; The brunette sighed. &quot;Are you gonna take it or not?&quot; 

The blue-haired girl paused for a while. She thought deeply to herself 
as on what to do. Be a slut, be a coward, or be herself. 

&quot;Oh gods...&quot; 

Ami finally nodded. Her tall friend also nodded, but was caught off 
guard as Ami snatched away the crotchless panties and teddies. 

&quot;I think I&#39;ll do the picking now.&quot; 

------------------------------------------------------------

Rei waved goodbye to her grandfather as the cab sped off. Along with 
them is Ami&#39;s mother, who also had a flight for an upcoming medical 
convention. Makoto have agreed to take Rei&#39;s place in the shrine for 
the time being, as Usagi got grounded for sneaking out with Mamoru the 
other night. Minako, on the other hand, was too busy catching up on 
the schoolwork she had missed out because of her flu. 

&quot;Oh, Rei, it&#39;s been a while since I&#39;ve seen you. My, what a beatiful 
young woman you have become!&quot;, greeted Mrs. Mizuno as she bowed down 
slightly. Rei bowed back then nodded her head. &quot;Yes, Mizuno-sama. And 
I&#39;ve heard you&#39;re attending a convention in Germany?&quot; The older woman 
nodded, then looked over at her daughter. 

&quot;I hope my daughter would not be causing you much trouble in your 
vacation.&quot;, said Mrs. Mizuno in a sweet manner. 

&quot;Mother...&quot;, Ami said quietly. 

&quot;Oh, no! I&#39;ve been with her before and she wasn&#39;t a trouble at 
all...&quot;, Rei said as she scratched her head. &quot;..I mean I was the one 
who caused trouble, really.&quot; 

Mrs. Mizuno looked up for a moment, thinking. &quot;Oh, yes, I remember 
that time...it was three years ago, right? You took Ami along with you 
in that love cruise.&quot; She giggled. &quot;And I used to tease my daughter 
about her having a crush on you.&quot; 

&quot;MOTHER!&quot; 

Rei laughed, failing to take notice of Ami clenching her fists and 
blushing to a deep crimson. Suddenly, cutting her laughter short, Rei 
said in her normal tone, &quot;Well, I wouldn&#39;t mind asking you for 
permission to date your daughter.&quot; Mrs. Mizuno blinked, and stared at 
the serious-looking Rei. Ami also stared at the other girl, her mouth 
open in shock. Mrs. Mizuno and Rei began to laugh out like 
schoolgirls, while Ami just continued staring at Rei skeptically. 

&quot;Oh...oh...you almost got me there, Rei...oh...&quot;, Mrs. Mizuno rasped, 
as she tried regain her breath. The raven-haired girl smiled and said, 
&quot;Yeah, well, she&#39;s cute, but not really my type, ne, Ami-chan?&quot; 

The pale girl could only nod, with a fakish smile on her face. 

&quot;Gods, why did I have to fall in love with such a complete 
IDIOT...!!&quot;, screamed Ami in her mind. 

------------------------------------------------------------

Can Ami&#39;s genius get through the barrier of Rei&#39;s insensitivity and 
bitchness? Will Rei finally get her priestess instincts working at 
Ami&#39;s advantage? And will a Youma ruin Ami&#39;s plan? Find out, in the 
next chapter 2! </pre>
