<h1>A Tired Heart's Desire (part 1 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/balticbard.html">Balticbard</a><br> </h2>
<pre>author&#39;s note; yes, folks, this story is based on the Sailor Moon 
characters; but not on the series itself. These are not saccarin sweet, 
characters for children on a weekday afternoon. There are no cartoons 
in this story; they are all adults in adult situations. There are no 
Japanese words mingled with the prose; I don&#39;t speak Japanese. I wish 
that I did, but I don&#39;t. I speak English, and Spanish; and no, I will 
not mingle Spanish words in here. Nope; the story is purely American. 
There are no comedic situations, where I try to describe what goes on, 
as if it were a comic book. The story is lesbian in nature; men only 
make appearances; speak little or nothing. The characters don&#39;t have 
pink or blue hair. Only one scene with a monster; and it gets destroyed 
quickly; I write drama, I don&#39;t do sci-fi; but well I needed one in 
here. These are young women, adult, somewhat responsible in their 
actions; and the personalities of each character does not mirror that 
of the character in the original series. I made some changes; to fit 
this story into the alt. fiction category, so that it will be more 
compatible with my other stories on my site. 

Cast of Characters;

scouts, her element, and planet is the moon, so that she displays a

------------------------------------------------------------

Somewhere amid the jumbled chaos of her mind, Mina struggled to find 
her way back to reality, back to life, to her friends....back to Rei. 

Mina didn&#39;t know where she was, as she glanced around her. The sky 
wasn&#39;t blue anymore, it was reddish, and gray. The shadows around Mina 
weren&#39;t of green forests, or flowing crystal rivers. What lay about 
Mina was a wide, seemingly endless wasteland. 

Mina sighed sadly. She had long ago stopped crying. Tears were useless 
now, and would never free Mina from this strange hell that Serena had 
sent her to. 

Serena. 

The memory of Serena quickened the rage in Mina&#39;s aching heart. Mina 
recalled Serena&#39;s angry, hate-filled eyes, as she raised her moon-
scepter, and sent her into hell. 

&quot;I hate you Serena. You sent me to hell. You took away my right to live 
in my world. You branded me a monster, you lied to the others about me. 
You sent me away so that you could keep Rei to yourself.&quot; 

Rei. 

The memory of Rei, her beloved, broght tears to Mina&#39;s eyes, &quot;Rei....I 
need you so much. I feel empty without you; I feel unfinished. I love 
you, Rei, with all of my heart.&quot; 

Mina continued to float over the wasteland, ocassionally glancing down 
at the yellowish surface of the ground, &quot;you haven&#39;t won, Serena,&quot; Mina 
thought, &quot;you will never have Rei&#39;s love. Rei can&#39;t love you, Serena. 
Rei loves me, only me. Rei, and I share a single soul.&quot; 

Mina&#39;s eyes misted over, &quot;where are my hands?&quot; Mina looked down at her 
hands, always so pale, and small, but couldn&#39;t even see them, &quot;oh....I 
forgot....I don&#39;t have hands anymore. I&#39;m not even human now!&quot; Mina 
began to cry, but what came out of her mouth wasn&#39;t even a woman&#39;s 
scream, it was a loud, shrill, bestial sound. That was all that Mina 
had left for a voice; an uninteligible, animal scream. But inside, Mina 
knew that she was still the same; human in thought, and heart. 

Now,Mina slowly put her thoughts in order, rescuing them from their 
former, chaotic existence. Memories, vivid, alive, moving, sounds, 
smells fo her former life began to return as Mina recalled how this 
nightmare had begun. 

It all started at a party that Mina, and the rest of the group had gone 
to. The group was of course, Mina, Amy, Serena, Darian, and....her Rei. 

Rei. 

Mina felt herself smile, or at least she thought that she might be 
smiling. Everytime that she thought of Rei, her heart filled with joy, 
pleasure, and love. 

&quot;Rei.....My Rei.....Mine.....my love......MINE.....forever mine.&quot; 

The party had been a grand affair, held at the lavish, popular 
nightclub &quot;Tensami,&quot; located in uptown Tokyo. The band playing was 
called &quot;FarCry,&quot; which was the most popular pop band at that moment. 

The party had been announced only two weeks in advance, and only 
Tokyo&#39;s most wealthy teens would be invited; that of course included 
all six of the power team; Japan&#39;s super heroes, the Sailor Scouts, and 
Tuxedo Mask, who in everyday life were all from wealthy families. 

The Tensami nightclub had been very crowded, the extremely loud music 
could be heard blocks away, and the flashing, multi-colored lights from 
inside the club could be seen outside on the street, almost blinding 
passing motorists, and pedestrians. 

The group arrived early. Darian had picked up all of the girls, (of 
course Amy, and Lita had dates), in his father&#39;s oversized, shiny, 
black limousine. 

Darian&#39;s chauffeur stopped in front of the Tensami, and waited 
patiently for every one to get out of the limousine. 

Darian got out first, and then helped Serena, his fiancee, and future 
wife out. Then, Ken, Lita&#39;s date got out, and helped her out, and then 
helped both Mina, and Rei(who didn&#39;t have dates), get out of the car. 
Finally, Greg, Amy&#39;s date got out, and helped Amy get out of the car. 

There were eight of them, and they all stood, for a moment, outside the 
Tensama, filled with anticipation. All of them entered the nightclub in 
pairs; Darina, and Serena, Lita, and Ken, Amy, and Greg, and finally, 
Mina, and Rei. 

Rei. 

Mina trembled, as she recalled Rei, her beautiful friend. Mina had 
trembled that night, as she held Rei&#39;s soft, pale hand in her own, as 
they walked into the busy nightclub, into the arms of the thriving 
party. 

&quot;Oh, Rei. You are so beautiful, that you take my breath away. I just 
couldn&#39;t stop looking at you that night. I had to stop myself from 
throwing my arms around you, and kissing you on the lips in front of 
everyone.&quot; 

That night, the plan had been, that Mina, and Rei would tease every man 
within sight of them. The two girls had dressed in their most 
provocative clothes, and looked so stunning when they entered the 
nightclub, that not only had the men started looking at them, but also 
the women. 

Once inside, the group got a corner table that Darian had reserved for 
them in advance. Amy, Lita, Ken, Greg, all got up immediately, and 
began to dance. Darian, and Serena stayed at the table to cuddle. Rei 
got up, and turned to Mina. 

&quot;Come on, Mina,&quot; Rei said with a smile, as she got up off her chair, 
&quot;let&#39;s go party!&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Mina was suddenly awakened from her revelry, about her erotic 
fantasies about Rei, as her deep, blue eyes softly carressed Rei&#39;s 
voluptuous curves, about the smooth, almost feline way the gorgeous 
brunette seemed to move. 

&quot;Hey! Mina wake up!&quot; 

&quot;I heard you, Rei....I&#39;d rather stay here for a while.&quot; 

&quot;Mina, are you ok?&quot; Rei was worried at her beautiful companion&#39;s sudden 
sullenness. 

&quot;I&#39;m just fine, Rei.&quot; 

&quot;Okay, so I&#39;m going to mingle a bit. I&#39;ll come back to fetch you later, 
Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Ok, Rei.&quot; 

But Mina wasn&#39;t alright. At that precise moment, Mina didn&#39;t really 
want to be at the boisterous party; she really only wanted to be alone 
with her gorgeous friend, Rei, to hold her, to kiss her. 

For the last month, beautiful, blond Mina had been doing a lot of soul 
searching. Mina had been analyzing her life, and the lack of love in 
it. Yes, of course, Mina was in reality Venus, the goddess of love. But 
even as a goddess, Mina lacked the presence of love in her life. 

Mina&#39;s father was a wealthy workaholic businessman who was always away 
on some business trip, or visiting one of his two mistresses, and had 
no time to spend with his only daughter. Mina&#39;s mother was always away 
on some cruise, or at some social event, or at some luncheon with her 
high society friends, or with her secret, lesbian lover, and had no 
time for her only daughter. 

Mina had always been extremely beautiful, and from a very young age had 
begun attracting older men. Mina started her sexual activity when she 
was only twelve years of age, hoping to find in men the love that she 
lacked from her parents. Now, at the age of eighteen, Mina had a very 
LONG list of lovers behind her, and she had yet to capture the elusive 
emotion of true love. 

Mina was fed up with men in general. All of her lovers had used Mina&#39;s 
body to obtain their own sexual pleasure, but had not given it to her 
in return. Mina was ashamed to admit to herself that the only orgasms 
that she ever had were when she masturbated. 

Now, at eighteen, Mina had made a very important decision that many 
people would say that she was much too young to make; she wanted a 
permanent companion, a soulmate, someone to be with her forever. Mina 
wanted to wake up, spend the day with, and go to bed with the same 
person for the rest of her life. 

Mina had also made another VERY important decision; the person that she 
wanted to spend the rest of her life with was to be a WOMAN. No more 
men for Mina. Men were far too selfish and boring in Mina&#39;s opinion. 

But of course, no ordinary woman would ever do for the goddess of love, 
who happened to be immortal. Mina wanted FOREVER, so no mortal woman, 
doomed to old age, and death would ever do as her lover. Mina wanted an 
immortal lover like herself. So, Mina had to look among her own friends 
to choose her lover, and she only had FOUR choices; Serena, Lita, Amy, 
and Rei. 

Mina weighed all of her options, coldly, and clinically analyzed each 
of her friends; physically, emotionally, mentally. Mina had measured, 
and re-evaluated her final decision to the point of exhaustion, but she 
had finally picked the one who would be her soulmate, and lover 
forever; Rei, the senshi of fire, and passion. 

Mina had coldly decided that Rei would be her permanent lover for 
eternity. Mina had of course considered that Rei, being heterosexual, 
might not agree with such a decision, that the girl might even already 
be in love with someone else. But of course, a confident, arrogant Mina 
had decided that nothing, and no one would keep Rei from her, that she 
would bind the beautiful girl to her with a powerful love spell to last 
forever. 

Mina had decided to forego wooing, and courting the stunningly 
beautiful brunette, and trying to win her love. Mina had no time for 
that. Mina was desperate, lonely, and miserable. The beautiful senshi 
of love needed Rei NOW. Mina wasn&#39;t willing to wait anymore. 

That was when Mina started looking at Rei differently; no longer as a 
friend, but as a lover. Mina had discovered that her lack of love also 
spilled over into her friendships. Mina had noticed that even though 
she saw the gang every single day, she really wasn&#39;t close to any of 
them. Amy, and Lita were close to each other. Serena had Darian, but 
she had paired off with Rei. Mina had discovered that even in 
friendship, she was totally alone. 

Serena. 

Once more, feelings of hate rose up in Mina&#39;s heart. Serena had Darian, 
and then she greedily clung to Rei. That wasn&#39;t fair in Mina&#39;s eyes. 
Now, Mina recalled something odd that she had never noticed before; 
Serena was always watching Rei with eyes filled with lust, and desire. 

Mina had then become determined to take Rei away from Serena. It was 
settled. It was final; Mina wanted Rei as her best friend, as well as 
her lover. Mina was determined; Rei was her property now. 

That was when it all truly began; three, and a half weeks before the 
party at the Tensama. A tense, discreet rivalry between Mina, and 
Serena had begun over Rei&#39;s friendship, and ultimately, her love. 

Rei. 

Mina felt her heart flutter with love, and excitement, as she recalled 
her stunning lover. 

Rei wasn&#39;t very tall really, at just 5&#39; 7&quot;. Rei had a slender, yet 
voluptuous body, with long, curvaceous legs, an unbelievably tiny 
waist, slender, pale arms, and the most supple, firm, round breasts 
that Mina had ever seen, and wanted desperately to fondle in her 
trembling hands. Rei had long, thick, wild hair, so black, so shiny, 
that it glowed in fantastic, deep, blue high-lights under the sunlight. 
Rei&#39;s skin was soft to the touch, creamy, unblemished alabaster in 
tone. Rei&#39;s beautiful, oval face was decorated with big, glowing, 
cerulean eyes, and full, moist, crimson lips that were driving Mina mad 
with desire. 

The touching had started discreetly; Mina would always sit next to Rei 
at restaurants, or at the movies, or walk next to her when all of the 
five girls went to the mall together. Serena, and Mina would get into 
an argument, because Serena had always sat next to Rei everywhere they 
went together, and now Mina was getting in her way; always greedily 
taking a seat, or standing next to the ravishing brunette. Rei would 
roll her eyes, when she saw Mina, and Serena argue over a seat next to 
her, and ultimately, she would end up sitting between the two, angry 
blonds. When Rei ended up sitting between Mina, and Serena at the 
movies, she would ultimately end up feeling the wandering, caressing 
hands of both girls fondling her beautiful, voluptuous body, until both 
sets of hands would end up touching, and an argument would start up 
between the battling blonds. 

Mina would do her best to race Serena to Rei&#39;s side. Mina would find 
every opportunity, use every lie, or excuse that she ould think of to 
touch Rei. Mina would hug Rei frequently, holding the girl tightly 
against her, even if it was only for a few seconds. Whenever she could, 
Mina would run her slender fingers through Rei&#39;s wild, raven hair, 
admiring, enjoying the silky feel of the girl&#39;s dark locks. While 
walking to school, Mina would take Rei&#39;s arm, or put her arm around 
Rei&#39;s very tiny waist, or around her firm shoulders, &quot;....I just can&#39;t 
believe how small Rei&#39;s waist is....&quot; Mina would think to herself. 
Serena would throw dirty looks at Mina, as she too tried to do the 
same. Serena would always take Rei to the restroom with her, when the 
five girls went out, and Mina would brazenly follow them. Mina would 
take Rei, and slip away with her when all the girls were together 
during one of their daily study sessions, and Serena would get up, and 
go look for them. 

Everyone, but Rei, it seemed, had noticed that Mina had a crush on her. 
The others had noticed the soft sighs of desire, the intense gazes that 
Mina gave Rei, the seemingly casual way that Mina frequently took Rei&#39;s 
hand in her own, and laced their fingers together. The others had 
noticed Mina&#39;s possessive behavior towards Rei. More than that, the 
other girls had seen in amazement, how much bolder, and brazen, Mina&#39;s 
touching of Rei had become, to the point that they had seen her 
actually fondling the gorgeous brunette&#39;s breasts. Even moreso, were 
Serena&#39;s intense jealousy, and frequent bouts of rage when she saw 
Mina, and Rei together, and her now almost constant fights with Mina. 

Finally, for the very first time in her life, Mina, goddess of love, 
senshi of beauty, and desire, had fallen desperately, hopelessly in 
love, with Rei, the goddess of fire, the senshi of passion. 

Amy, and Lita had noticed Mina&#39;s sudden crush on Rei, but said nothing. 
Serena had noticed Mina&#39;s sudden attachment to Rei, and was enraged, 
constantly bickering with Mina over Rei. If Rei had noticed Mina&#39;s 
sudden attraction to her, she was silent about it, and did nothing to 
stop Mina&#39;s advances. Instead, Rei allowed Mina&#39;s passionate, 
increasingly bold touches, that were becoming more, and more intimate 
with each passing day. 

One day, all five of the girls were at the Hikawa temple, Rei&#39;s home, 
and were she served as priestess, studying for a test in algebra that 
would be given the very next day. Rei got up from her seat at the 
table, where the others sat in silence, intensely studying. 

&quot;Back in a minute, guys,&quot; Rei said with a smile, &quot;have to go to my room 
to get my biology book.&quot; 

&quot;Kay,&quot; the other girls mumbled, as they kept their noses within their 
books. 

Mina watched Rei get up, and leave the room. Wordlessly, Mina got up, 
and followed Rei. The others stopped studying, and watched Mina leave. 
Serena was about to follow Mina, but Amy held her back, mumbling that 
she had to keep studying. Amy, and Lita exchanged knowing glances, 
knowing what Mina was up to. 

Mina walked down the hall, and entered Rei&#39;s room. Mina found Rei 
standing next to her desk, rummaging through a pile of schoolbooks. 

Mina came up behind Rei, and wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s tiny 
waist. 

&quot;Mina....&quot; 

&quot;Yes.....Rei.....I,&quot; Mina was trembling, as she held the girl&#39;s 
curvaceous body tightly against her. 

&quot;What is it, Mina?&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....well.....have you noticed....I mean......you, and I......we 
haven&#39;t ever really talked......we have never....really been alone 
together.....I mean.....I never get to see 
you.....like.....this.....,&quot; Mina&#39;s voice had become husky with 
passion. 

&quot;But we see each other every day, Mina,&quot; Rei said, as she turned in 
Mina&#39;s arms, and faced her. 

&quot;But we see each other when the others are with us,&quot; Mina replied 
complainingly, &quot;I want to see you......alone.&quot; 

&quot;Well....ummm......yes.....I suppose,&quot; a very embarrassed Rei said 
softly. 

&quot;Rei.....I.....uuummmmm....&quot; 

&quot;Mina, why are you so nervous?&quot; 

&quot;Rei......I want to.....to get to know you better.....to be closer to 
you.....I....I want to......well.....I want to live here with you!&quot; 

&quot;Okay.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Mina was shocked at Rei&#39;s quick, simple reply, &quot;that&#39;s it?&quot; 

&quot;Yes.&quot; 

&quot;But, Rei....will your grandfather approve?&quot; 

&quot;My grandfather really doesn&#39;t censure me, and pretty much gives me 
free rein over my life, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....&quot; Mina was so happy, that she gathered her friend up into a 
huge bear hug, &quot;I&#39;m so happy....&quot; 

&quot;Mina....don&#39;t crush me!&quot; Rei was laughing, as she tried to escape from 
Mina&#39;s iron hug. 

&quot;Oh.....ooopppsss.....sorry, Rei.&quot; 

Then, Rei, still in Mina&#39;s arms, said in a grave tone; &quot;oh, but there 
are conditions, young lady!&quot; 

&quot;Like what, miss high, and mighty senshi of fire?&quot; Mina asked. 

&quot;Well....miss stuck up senshi of love, and beauty, help me clean up 
around here, do the cooking sometimes, do the dishes, take out the 
garbage......trim the hedges around the temple, sweep the steps.....&quot; 
Rei replied with an evil smile. 

&quot;You.....YOU SLAVE DRIVER!&quot; Mina yelled as she quickly pushed Rei onto 
the bed, then threw herself on top of her. 

&quot;Mina.....stop that! GET OFF ME, you silly chicken!&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t do TOILETS, Rei! I am not a silly chicken. Take that back, or 
I&#39;ll torture you!&quot; 

&quot;HAH! Mina, you couldn&#39;t torture an egg into hatching!&quot; 

Mina shifted, but kept herself firmly anchored to Rei, and with one 
free hand, began to tickle her beautiful fire priestess mercilessly. 

Rei began to laugh uncontrollably, and thick tears ran from her eyes, 
down her rosy cheeks, as she managed to cry out several words, before 
another bout of laughter overtook her; &quot;HELP! RAPE!&quot; 

Rei somehow managed to flip Mina over, and tried to escape. But a very 
lithe, swift goddess of love trapped her stunningly beautiful brunette 
from behind, pulling her back into her grasp. Amid laughter, and 
squeals, the two girls wrestled, and Mina managed to tear Rei&#39;s shirt 
open, and almost off her shoulders. A stunned Rei managed to grab 
Mina&#39;s short skirt, and tear it off her. Then, Mina grabbed Rei from 
behind, somehow managed to loosen the girl&#39;s khaki shorts, and pull 
them all the way down to her ankles. Rei caught hold of Mina&#39;s t-shirt, 
and tugged so hard, that it tore down the front. Mina quickly shook off 
her t-shirt, dove madly at Rei, pinning her down on the bed, pulling on 
the girl&#39;s shirt so hard, that it finally tore away from her lovely 
body, then Mina grabbed at Rei&#39;s white, lace bra, tearing it easily off 
the fire senshi. Mina was now on top of Rei again, tickling the 
helpless, laughing girl everywhere, including handling Rei&#39;s soft, 
supple, firm breasts. 

Suddenly, both girls were stirred from their feisty game by souds; 
giggling, snorting, and gasps. 

&quot;Uh, oh....&quot; Rei said. 

&quot;Oooopppsss.....&quot; Mina replied. 

At the door to Rei&#39;s room stood an angry, jealous Serena with her arms 
crossed, and behind her stood a giggling Amy, and Lita. 

The scene that met Serena&#39;s angry, sapphire eyes was quite suggestive; 
Mina on top of Rei, both of them disheveled, almost nude, and Mina&#39;s 
hands on Rei&#39;s breasts. 

&quot;What are you two DOING?&quot; Serena&#39;s shrill voice sounded quite angry, 
and indignant. 

For years, Serena, and Rei had been secret lovers. Serena had enjoyed 
Rei&#39;s beautiful body, and now she was jealous, and enraged that Mina 
had taken her place in Rei&#39;s arms. Serena considered Rei to be 
exclusively hers. Now, Serena had the pure urge to just violently 
strangle Mina, her Sailor Venus. 

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Mina, and Rei replied in unison. 

&quot;It doesn&#39;t look that way to me!&quot; Serena exclaimed angrily, her voice 
raging like sudden thunder, as she glared dangerously, venomously at 
Mina. 

Amy, and Lita, who had known for a long time now, just what Serena 
&quot;DID&quot; to Rei during her sleepovers at the temple, couldn&#39;t help 
themselves, and began to tease Serena. 

&quot;Oh....I think we should leave, Serena....THEY WANT TO BE ALONE!&quot; Amy 
exclaimed loudly. 

&quot;What a lovely couple they make, don&#39;t you think so, Serena?&quot; Lita 
asked, as an evil smile lit her beautiful face. 

&quot;STOP that you two!&quot; Serena yelled at Amy, and Lita, &quot;it isn&#39;t funny.&quot; 

&quot;Its not what you guys think,&quot; Rei exclaimed. 

&quot;Yeah....sure!&quot; Serena replied, her angry voice laden with irony. 

&quot;Mina&#39;s moving in with me,&quot; Rei said happily. 

&quot;No!&quot; Serena exclaimed anxiously. 

&quot;Why not, Serena?&quot; Mina said angrily, &quot;why do you care? Its none of 
your business anyway.&quot; 

Amy, and Lita fell into another fit of uncontrollable giggling. 

&quot;Aaaawww, POOR Serena!&quot; Amy exclaimed, &quot;no more &quot;FUN&quot; sleepovers for 
you in Rei&#39;s bed!&quot; 

&quot;No more &quot;MASSAGES&quot; for Rei from your &quot;CAPABLE&quot; hands, huh Serena?&quot; 
Lita asked teasingly. 

Serena began to cry, and sob deeply, then turned, and ran from Rei&#39;s 
room, followed by two apologetic, yet still giggling Amy, and Lita. 

&quot;What was that all about?&quot; a very confused Mina asked. 

&quot;Oh....nothing really,&quot; a very embarrassed, blushing Rei replied. 

&quot;So....Rei......I guess I&#39;m staying tonight; a sleepover to celebrate 
my PERMANENT sleeping over.&quot; 

&quot;Clever line, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Since we&#39;re the same size, Rei....I&#39;m going to need something of yours 
to wear.&quot; 

&quot;How do you know we are the same size, Mina?&quot; 

&quot;I took your measurments when I was tickling you, Rei.&quot; 

&quot;You are so lewd, Mina.&quot; 

Mina only smiled evilly, and winked mischievously at her new roommate, 
and best friend. 

&quot;So....Rei....no more sleepovers for Serena?&quot; 

&quot;Oh, God.....NO.....I can&#39;t handle two blonds at once......&quot; 

&quot;BLONDS have more fun, Rei.&quot; 

&quot;BRUNETTES are sexier, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;NO WAY!&quot; Mina shouted. 

&quot;Well I don&#39;t see you trying to feel Serena up, Mina......but you 
certainly like to play doctor with me....and I am the sexiest brunette 
of ALL!&quot; 

&quot;Why.....you..........doctor, huh? I guess I&#39;ll just have to &quot;TAKE&quot; 
your measurements AGAIN, Rei!&quot; 

&quot;Oh......NO!&quot; Rei yelled in terror as she tried to get away, but Mina 
had already managed to grab a pillow, and hit her with it. 

If the study session was over, if Amy, Lita, and Serena had gone home, 
Mina would never know, or care, because she was busy, involved in an 
intense pillow fight with Rei, whom she later grabbed, and proceeded to 
tickle, and totally undress. 

The first night that she spent at Rei&#39;s, was like heaven for Mina. The 
blond goddess slept with Rei in her arms. All of Mina&#39;s feelings of 
loneliness fled, as she held the beautiful brunette in her arms, as 
they shared the same bed, and the same pillow. Never in all of her 
life, had Mina felt such pleasure, such joy; never, not even during the 
nights that she spent with a male lover. None of her former lovers 
could compare with what Mina had now; the sensations were different. A 
man&#39;s body was strong, hard, lumpy, and his smell was strong, 
overwhelming, musky. But to Mina, Rei was soft, warm, plush, an endless 
series of voluptuous curves that seemed to fit her own beautiful body 
like the missing piece of an incomplete puzzle. To Mina, Rei&#39;s scent 
was like flowery incense, from her silky, obsidian hair, to the 
fragrance of her unbelievably silken skin. Mina sighed, as she woke up 
several times during that first night, and spent a few moments each 
time, to watch Rei as she slept. Now, Mina wondered how she had been 
able to live up until now, living only from the love of men, never 
having known the unbelievably exquisite beauty, and feel of a woman in 
her arms, of the most beautiful woman that she had ever seen, her 
priestess of fire, her senshi of passion.....Rei. Now, Mina knew that 
she had been born for this moment; for this fate, that she had only 
merely existed in the barest sense of the word; but that now she was 
finally, truly alive, as she embraced the most beguiling, the most 
beautiful of the Sailors in her pale, slender arms; her Rei, her love. 

The next day, an excited, anxious, overjoyed Mina dragged Rei to the 
mansion that she had lived in, picked up some of her belongings, 
stuffed them quickly into a duffle bag, turned her back, never to 
return. Mina was eighteen now, of age, and finally able to decide 
where, and with whom she wanted to live. Mina&#39;s parents weren&#39;t even 
home to say goodbye to their estranged daughter. 

Mina didn&#39;t just move in with Rei; Mina took over Rei&#39;s life. Mina had 
brought very few things over from her house, to the temple, especially 
her clothes. Mina was now wearing Rei&#39;s clothes, reading Rei&#39;s books, 
listening to Rei&#39;s cd&#39;s, watching Rei&#39;s movies, and.....reading Rei&#39;s 
secret diary. 

&quot;MINA!&quot; Rei exclaimed, when she saw her personal diary in Mina&#39;s small 
hands, &quot;how could you? Give that back to me!&quot; 

Mina was laughing, running around the room, waving Rei&#39;s diary in the 
air, and fleeing from Rei&#39;s desperate grasp, &quot;wow, Rei.....what a love 
life.....you slept with....Chad....Andrew.....Dave.....William......,&quot; 
Mina stopped cold, when she read off the last name on the list of Rei&#39;s 
lovers; &quot;DARIAN?&quot; 

Rei had stopped chasing Mina, and now sat quietly on her bed, &quot;he was 
my first love, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Does Serena know this, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;It wouldn&#39;t matter if she did know, Mina. It was a long time ago. He 
left me almost right away.&quot; 

Mina quickly handed the diary back to Rei, &quot;hey, Rei.....I won&#39;t tell 
anyone what you wrote, ok?&quot; 

&quot;I know you won&#39;t, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;You trust me....just like that....so quickly....so easily, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;I trust you with my life, Mina,&quot; Rei replied quietly. 

&quot;Rei.....no has ever said that to me before,&quot; a very moved, tearful 
Mina took the gorgeous priestess in her arms, and hugged her, &quot;thank 
you....&quot; 

&quot;Stop being so silly, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Rei......&quot; 

&quot;Hhhmmmm?&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....can....I......write in your diary?&quot; 

Rei started laughing so hard, she was actually crying, &quot;oh.....my 
God....you are so......oh....alright!&quot; 

&quot;Wow......&quot; Mina said to herself, when Rei 
agreed.......&quot;oh....wow....&quot; 

Rei handed the diary to Mina, &quot;help yourself, silly chicken.....&quot; then 
the senshi of fire got up off the bed, and headed towards the bathroom. 

&quot;Where are you going, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;To take a bath, then go to bed, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Pretty early, isn&#39;t it Rei?&quot; Mina was actually batting her eyelashes 
at the gorgeous brunette. 

&quot;Your flirting techniques are so.......eccentric, Mina,&quot; Rei said as 
she went into the bathroom, turned on the shower, adjusted the water 
temperature to lukewarm, undressed, and got in. 

Mina knew that Rei was in the shower....nude. Unable to hold herself 
back anymore, the beautiful blond undressed quickly, went into the 
bathroom, parted the curtain, and got into the shower with a VERY 
shocked priestess. 

&quot;MINA?&quot; 

&quot;Close your mouth, Rei....you&#39;ll swallow all the bubbles!&quot; 

Mina&#39;s comical comment was enough to make Rei forget her apparent 
embarrassment. 

&quot;You stutter like a turkey, Mina.&quot; 

&quot;Ooohhhh......you!&quot; Mina exclaimed in mock anger, &quot;give me the soap, 
you crazy thing,&quot; Mina took the soap, and soap towel, out of a startled 
Rei&#39;s hand, and expertly began to lather the girl, &quot;we&#39;ll be in here 
like two dried prunes, all night, if I don&#39;t bathe you, Rei!&quot; 

&quot;Hey! I am not a BABY! I can bathe myself....stop that, 
Mina....or....I&#39;ll.....&quot; 

Rei was quickly shut up by Mina&#39;s soap covered hand. 

Mina had worked up a huge, thick, mountain of lather that seemed to 
stubbornly refuse the falling spray of water&#39;s attempt to dilute it. 
Amid Rei&#39;s squeals of surprise, and embarrassment, a very determined, 
greedy, blond goddess Mina lathered her ravishing friend&#39;s voluptuous 
body, taking advantage of the situation to fondle, caress, and pinch a 
distraught, nervous, ticklish goddess of fire, who tried in vain to 
avoid her wandering hands. At the same time, Mina managed to lather 
herself, shampoo Rei&#39;s raven locks, then her own as well. 

Amid a flurry of laughter, and protests, somehow, the cold water got 
turned on, showering the stunned, screaming girls, who quickly got out 
of the shower, and exited the bathroom. 

Once outside the bathroom, a persistent Mina pursued Rei around the 
room, finally trapping her, and began drying off the girl with her 
gigantic, plush, pink towel. 

&quot;Mina?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;Shouldn&#39;t you UNWRAP the towel from around your body FIRST, and then 
dry me with it, Mina?&quot; 

&quot;Oh......yeah!&quot; 

It was true; Mina&#39;s towel was still draped around her shoulders, and 
back, as she used what little was left of it to dry her precious senshi 
of fire in the slowest, most erotic manner possible. 

&quot;Mina....&quot; 

&quot;Yes? What now, Rei?&quot; 

&quot;Well....Mina....now you aren&#39;t using the towel to dry me....you&#39;re 
using your BODY....and....well....we&#39;re BOTH nude....and....STANDING 
TOO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER!&quot; 

&quot;Yeah.....you&#39;re right, Rei.....I can fix that!&quot; 

&quot;NO......Mina.....WAIT!&quot; 

Mina didn&#39;t wait, as she quickly, expertly pushed Rei back onto their 
bed, and then fell on top of her. 

&quot;Oh.....this....is so......much better,&quot; Mina managed to say in a low, 
husky voice, as her mind, and beautiful body exploded into a million, 
tiny lights, as a trillion bolts of pure ecstasy shot through her at 
the delicious contact of Rei&#39;s soft, naked skin against her own bare 
body. 

Mina&#39;s mind reeled with delight, her heart raced madly, like a winning 
stock car, as she felt the touch of Rei&#39;s skin against her. To Mina, 
Rei felt like the soft, warm, silken surface of a newborn child. Rei&#39;s 
body was so plush, that Mina wanted to drown in it for eternity, 
&quot;oooohhhhh......I.....Rei......&quot; 

Mina&#39;s last intelegible thought vanished, as she began to grind herself 
against Rei&#39;s beautiful, voluptuous body. 

Silken skin, and warm, plush curves melted into each other, as the two 
girls embraced, tangling their curvaceous legs into a single strand of 
shapely flesh. Bare, quivering breasts lost their roundness to each 
other, as pert, hardened nipples brushed against each other, then 
fused, as if in a permanent kiss. Mouths sought each other out, 
hungrily joining, mingling saliva, as Mina&#39;s bright, pink lips covered 
Rei&#39;s ruby lips, with fervent desire. 

Like two, medieval violins playing a single melody, the beautiful girls 
writhed together, grinding against each other in a slow, constant, 
intimate rhythm that didn&#39;t waver, or stop. 

Mina moaned, as she desperately tried to slow herself down, to lengthen 
the undescribable joy, and pleasure that she was experiencing, as her 
entire, beautiful body surrendered to her intimate dance of desire. 
With a fierceness that she could hardly recognize within herself, Mina 
clung to her beloved Rei, who not only submitted to her, opening 
herself to the blond&#39;s passion, but who returned every kiss, and 
carress with equal fervor, and desire. Finally, the two girls climaxed; 
Mina first, then Rei seconds later. The quivering, profound sensation 
of pleasure that joined them, began to ebb away, as they seemed to 
slide down a smooth mountainside, after having gloriously skyrocketed 
to the stars. 

After a few minutes of trying to calm herself, Mina was able to speak, 
&quot;Rei....&quot; she whispered, &quot;can we stay like this for a while? I need to 
feel you close to me.....&quot; 

Rei&#39;s reply came gently, like the kiss of a butterfly; &quot;yes....&quot; 

Mina fell fast asleep, enveloped in warm, silken, slender, pale arms, 
and sprawled upon an exquisitely shaped, plush, voluptuous body of 
pleasure; Rei. 

Once more, reality came crashing into Mina&#39;s mind, as beloved memories 
faded back into darkness, and she returned to the present; to the 
barren, dark wasteland that Serena&#39;s pettiness, and wrath had condemned 
her to. 

&quot;I will always love you, Rei....no matter how much of an eternity apart 
we are.....I carry you in my heart.&quot; 

Mina floated silently along, glancing down at the burnt, yellow-gray 
earth beneath her. Once more, Mina closed her eyes, and returned to the 
past. 

Two weeks had passed for Mina in absolute happiness. Every night, the 
beautiful blond senshi of love slept with her gorgeous fire goddess in 
her arms. Often, at night, Mina would awaken, and spend long moments, 
just staring at the sleeping girl in her arms. Slowly, Mina would bring 
her hand up, and begin to caress Rei&#39;s firm, supple breasts, outlining 
their roundness with a delicate finger, enjoying the wondrous, silken 
softness of their skin, and finally teasing the round, red nipples that 
crowned each breast. During the first few times that Mina touched her, 
Rei woke up to catch an embarrassed, blushing Mina touching her 
intimately. Rei would regard the beautiful blond for a few seconds, 
then her half-lidded, sleep laden, cerulean eyes would close once more, 
as the stunning fire senshi would sink once more into the arms of 
awaiting dreams, that would carry her briefly into wondrous, far-away 
worlds. For an overjoyed Mina, Rei&#39;s quick return to deep slumber was a 
sign of trust, and acceptance of her bold, intimate caresses. So, from 
then on, Mina continued with her erotic touches, delightfully exploring 
her friend&#39;s pale, soft, warm, statuesque body in pure rapture. And as 
for Rei, the goddess of fire, and passion, she was never disturbed 
again by her companion&#39;s gentle, erotic touch. 

For Mina, it was a nagging question; were she, and Rei a couple, were 
they lovers? No words passed between the two girls about what happened 
between them; it just happened, and they accepted it as being natural, 
and continued on. 

Every night, Mina would wait up in bed for Rei to finish whatever task 
still awaited to be completed, so that the beautiful brunette could 
retire for the night. Mina found that she couldn&#39;t sleep, unless Rei 
was with her, in her arms. Mina&#39;s heart would leap with joy, and she 
would wrap her arms around her gorgeous, raven-haired senshi doll, when 
the girl finally lay down in bed beside her. 

Mina would lovingly cuddle her gorgeous friend, then make love to her. 
Afterwards, both girls would lie in silence, tightly embraced, till 
sleep overtook them. 

Mina&#39;s wandering memory finally moved on to the fateful night that had 
changed her life forever, and finally led to her forced imprisonment on 
this strange, dark, barren world. 

The nightclub, Tensama was dimly lit, yet filled with colorful, 
flashing lights that gave everything an eerie glow that disappeared 
briefly between the intermitent flashing. Mina&#39;s mind was spinning, 
drowned by the explosive, echoing music around her that bounced off the 
walls, ricocheting like lost, angry bullets, and pounding into her 
ears. 

Mina had silently sat down at her table next to Darian. Serena sat on 
the other side of Darian, and the three of them watched Rei, Amy, and 
Lita standing close by, leaning against a wall, laughing, gossiping 
about the people dancing. Ken, and Greg, stood on the other end of the 
beautiful trio, watching them with interest. 

&quot;Aren&#39;t brunettes absolutely beautiful?&quot; 

Mina had been staring at Rei, and was startled out of her revelry by 
Darian&#39;s voice, &quot;huh?&quot; 

&quot;Well, aren&#39;t they?&quot; Darian asked, as a small smile lit up his handsome 
face. 

&quot;Yes, they certainly are,&quot; Mina replied with a sigh. 

&quot;So many different shades,&quot; Darian continued to say teasingly, &quot;Amy, 
with her dark brown hair, confusing Lita, with her golden auburn hair, 
almost blond in the sunlight, yet dark enough to be a brunette, and of 
course....Rei,&quot; Darian watched Mina&#39;s beautiful features closely, 
studying them, as if her thoughts were somehow mirrored there. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Mina replied dreamily, as she continued to stare at Rei. 

&quot;Your brunette is quite.....exquisite, Mina,&quot; Darian said knowingly. 

&quot;What do you mean HER brunette?&quot; Serena asked angrily, as she too, 
awoke from her quiet, romantic revelry of Rei. 

&quot;Lita is Ken&#39;s brunette, Amy is Greg&#39;s brunette....of course I&#39;m YOUR 
brunette....aren&#39;t I, bunny?&quot; Darian asked his lovely, delicate, blond 
bride, Serena, addressing her by his favorite pet name for her. 

&quot;Yes.....of course you are, Mamo....&quot;Serena replied quietly, guiltily, 
as she gazed up into her handsome lover&#39;s dark eyes. 

Serena simply looked away from Darian&#39;s probing eyes, that seemed to 
cut into her very soul, easily exposing all of her most intimate 
secrets, as she tried to hide the hurt in her crystal blue eyes. But 
her tender lover, Darian, pulled her close to him, and he lifted her 
chin with his free hand, making her look up at him, &quot;I know about you, 
and Rei, Bunny.....but we have an arrangement.....remember? Each of us 
can lead their own life, but not fall in love, bacause that will 
interfere with our duties. You have fallen in love with Rei. That is 
against our agreement. You have to let her go.&quot; 

Serema simply began to cry softly, as she closed her eyes, hiding her 
face in Darian&#39;s firm shoulder. 

All three of them; Serena, Darian, and Mina, were watching Rei closely. 
At that moment, a young man approached Rei, took her small hand, and 
led her out onto the dance floor. 

The dance floor was crowded, as an endless sea of young bodies moved 
together to a primal, musical beat that seemed to surge through their 
bodies, more powerful than blood itself. But then SHE came, the senshi 
of passion, wearing a tight, red dress, the color of her element; fire. 
Instinctively, the people moved aside, knowing in a primal sense that 
this was no ordinary woman, but a creature of enchantment. The 
stunningly beautiful vision was led by the hand of a handsome man, who 
was prouder than any man born as he showed off his prize. Then, as the 
music flowed, she was unleashed upon the crowd, and the people around 
her made room to watch her dance, to flow as she flowed. 

She was like the surface of a smooth, calm, crystal lake. Then she 
moved, her beautiful, voluptuous body swaying softly at first, like the 
first small ripples upon the calm surface of a lake, signaling the 
coming of a storm that creeps in without warning. As the music began to 
flow into her, becoming the very life of her young body, the raven 
haired beauty danced at a more heated rhythm, moving her wide hips, 
shaking her shoulders, as her nubile, firm breasts jiggled sexily. Her 
long, curvaceous legs moved to the overwhelming musical beat, as the 
rest of her body followed, like a first ripple on a silken, smooth 
fabric comes alive into a million wrinkles, and folds. 

Mina watched her only love, with her small hands balled into fists, her 
heart tight with aprehension, and fear, as Rei danced closer, and 
closer to the man dancing with her. Rei, and her partner were much too 
close to each other, and Mina didn&#39;t like it at all. Just then, 
something happened that changed everything; a second man cut in, 
pushing Rei&#39;s dance partner rudely to one side, and claiming the girl 
for himself. The two men started shoving each other around, fighting, 
shouting, as they fought over Rei, who stood back, and smiled, pleased 
at the reaction she caused in men, enjoying the primitive display of 
violence, of fierceness of the men. 

&quot;You, and Rei are very alike, Mina,&quot; Darian said to Mina. 

&quot;What do you mean, Darian?&quot; 

&quot;You turn men into fools, Mina. Rei turns men into stupid beasts.&quot; 

The fight on the dance floor had spread, so that now, more than two men 
were fighting over an amused Rei, who had stepped back. Now Rei 
accidentally bumped into two pretty, young women who stood behind her. 
Rei&#39;s overwhelming beauty, and her primal magnetism soon had the two 
women shoving each other, arguing fiercely over which one of them was 
going to buy Rei a drink at the bar. 

&quot;I&#39;m going to go get Rei before she starts a war,&quot; an amused Darian 
commented. 

&quot;No....I&#39;ll get her, Darian,&quot; Mina said, as she held him back. 

Finally, Mina had an excuse to leave the table, to leave Darian, and 
Serena. Yes, they were her friends, but it felt to Mina as if she were 
in a prison. Mina only wanted to be with her love; with Rei. 

Mina quickly got up off her seat, left the table, left Darian, and 
Serena behind, who watched her leave, knowing how eager the blond 
senshi was to be with Rei. Mina stepped out onto the dance floor. The 
beautiful blond goggess of love snaked her way around admiring men, who 
asked her to dance. But Mina&#39;s heart was like stone to the men who 
desired her, her face was cold, expressionless to them, as she moved 
past them, past their lust-filled gazes. 

Mina quickened her step, her heart racing madly, as her soul cried out 
to touch Rei once more. Never, had the beautiful goddess of love ever 
felt such a strong need for another person. Mina, or Venus, as she had 
been known in a distant time, had always been detached, superficial. 
But now, at a distant time, far removed from her past glory, the 
goddess of love was weary, tired, and longed for the slender, pale, 
loving arms of her fire senshi to hold her for forever, as she slipped 
into the darkness of eternity. 

Mina reached out, and her entire body screamed in joy, as she slipped 
her pale hand into Rei&#39;s soft one, &quot;Rei....&quot; she said huskily, as she 
felt her nipples harden, pressing up against the fabric of her 
brassiere, as goosebumps began to form on her arms, and breasts. Mina 
pulled her ravishing lover quickly away from the two, arguing women, 
from the angry, male rivals on the dance floor. Mina pulled her 
beautiful treasure quickly away into a dark hall, until the girls 
reached a restroom. Mina quickly ushered her gorgeous senshi doll of 
fire inside the empty restroom. 

Mina stood with her back against the door of the restroom, as if 
assuring herself that it was truly shut. Mina stood silent for just one 
moment, as her sapphire eyes traveled over Rei&#39;s voluptuous, slender 
form, over the way her short red dress clung so tightly to her curves, 
over how the girl&#39; long, raven hair danced upon her pale shoulders, and 
how wild, dark bangs framed her beautiful, oval face, over her glowing, 
blue eyes, over her moist, full, ruby lips. 

&quot;Rei.....&quot; 

&quot;Hhhmmmm?&quot; 

&quot;No more dancing for you, Rei.&quot; 

&quot;Hey!&quot; 

&quot;No more dancing,&quot; Mina said huskily, as she approached Rei, &quot;no more 
going off by yourself....no more parties....I want you with me every 
single second of the day, and night....I can&#39;t bear to be away from you 
Rei!&quot; 

&quot;Oh.....Mina.....&quot; Rei whispered, her voice satin on a soft, golden 
breeze. 

&quot;I can&#39;t bear to see anyone else but me touch you, Rei....I want you in 
my arms forever.....I&#39;m in love with you.&quot; 

Mina leaned into Rei, and wrapped her arms around her only dream, the 
love of her lonely life. In a heated frenzy, the blond senshi of love, 
kissed her beautiful, raven-haired obsession. With ease, and skill born 
of many lovers, Mina made love to Rei&#39;s full, crimson lips, sucking, 
enjoying their thickness, tickling Rei&#39;s tongue with her own, feeding 
her senshi of fire her saliva, enjoying the startlingly smooth surface 
of Rei&#39;s small, pearly white teeth, as her eager tongue danced over 
them. 

Suddenly Mina heard the restroom door open, and looked, thus 
reluctantly parting her full, pink lips from Rei&#39;s ruby lips. Mina was 
startled to see Serena, Amy, and Lita enter the restroom. 

&quot;See?&quot; Serena almost yelled, &quot;I told you that they were lovers!&quot; 

Amy was silent, and in her silence she agreed with Serena. 

Lita was more sympathetic towards Mina, &quot;so what, there&#39;s nothing wrong 
with their loving each other. Besides, Serena, you&#39;re angry because Rei 
isn&#39;t yours anymore.&quot; 

&quot;What?&quot; Mina was shocked by what Lita had just said. 

&quot;I thought you knew, Mina,&quot; Lita replied quickly, &quot;Serena, and Rei were 
lovers.&quot; 

&quot;I didn&#39;t know,&quot; was all that Mina could say, as she turned to look at 
Rei. 

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei said ashamedly, as she pulled away from Mina, believing that 
the beautiful blond would hate her now that the truth was out. Rei 
moved away from Mina, believing that it was better for her to leave, 
before her heart was broken by Mina&#39;s cruel words of rejection, &quot;I want 
to go now.....&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....&quot; Serena said pleadingly, as she stepped forward, with arms 
outstretched towards the ravishing brunette. 

&quot;No.....no.....NO!&quot; Mina cried as she reached out, and grabbed Rei&#39;s 
raven mane, wrapping the long, dark locks in her small fist, and 
pulling the retreating girl back towards her, &quot;I am NOT letting you go, 
Rei!&quot; 

&quot;But I though you would hate me, Mina,&quot; Rei said, surprised at the 
blond&#39;s reaction. 

&quot;Rei.....PLEASE....come back to me.....&quot; Serena pleaded with tears 
running from her sky blue eyes. 

&quot;NO!&quot; Mina exclaimed angrily, &quot;you have Darian, Serena.....Rei is 
MINE!&quot; 

&quot;I guess you don&#39;t know about that either, Mina,&quot; Lita said quietly. 

&quot;What else don&#39;t I know, Lita?&quot; Mina asked impatiently, &quot;I thought I 
knew everything, that I was a part of this group, now I&#39;m begining to 
wonder just what I&#39;m doing with you guys. I feel like an outsider.&quot; 

&quot;Well....Mina....Darian, and Serena love each other, but they aren&#39;t 
really lovers. The two of them have.....an arrangement; each one of 
them can have outside lovers, as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with 
their duty to marry. Darian is a homosexual, Mina......Serena 
is.....bisexual.&quot; 

Serena reached out, and caught hold of Rei&#39;s pale hand, &quot;Rei....I need 
you......I can&#39;t bear not having you in my arms.....I love you so 
much!&quot; 

&quot;But you don&#39;t love me enough to leave Darian,&quot; Rei replied sadly. 

&quot;You know that I can&#39;t, Rei,&quot;Serena said, her voice filled with 
anguish, and desperation, &quot;I&#39;m destined to marry Darian, we are both 
destined to rule earth as king, and queen. I will bear him an heir.&quot; 

&quot;I don&#39;t want to be a second hand love, Serena,&quot; Rei replied 
vehemently. 

&quot;You know that isn&#39;t true, Rei,&quot; Serena exclaimed desperately, &quot;I love 
only you. But I have a duty to be with Darian. I can&#39;t change that.&quot; 

&quot;Rei.....&quot;Mina said passionately, &quot;I love you with all of my heart. 
Please, Rei.....please marry me.&quot; 

At first it seemed totally laughable; Mina, goddess of love, Sailor 
Venus, senshi of love, and beauty, goddess of love, of sexual desire, 
of men, of heterosexual love, was madly in love with a beautiful girl, 
and proposing marriage to her. 

&quot;Please, Rei....: Mina had gotten down on her knees, &quot;my heart is in 
your hands,&quot; the beautiful blond senshi begged her goddess of fire, 
&quot;you are my only love. I will dedicate my eternity to loving you. 
Please, Rei....please be my wife.&quot; 

Rei didn&#39;t hesitate, as she smiled, as she helped Mina up off her 
kneew, &quot;yes, Mina.&quot; 

An overjoyed Mina hugged her gorgeous senshi doll, as tears ran from 
her gloriously blue eyes, as she started to cry, and laugh at the same 
time. 

&quot;NO! It can&#39;t be.....I won&#39;t let you go, Rei,&quot; Serena said angrily. 

&quot;Too late,&quot; Mina almost yelled back at her defeated, blond rival, &quot;Rei 
is mine forever now.&quot; 

&quot;This isn&#39;t the end of this, Mina,&quot;Serena replied angrily, &quot;I won&#39;t let 
you get away with this.&quot; 

&quot;Enough!&quot; Amy yelled, &quot;we are being summoned,&quot; Amy had taken her 
beeping scanner out of her purse, &quot;unknown entity has just materialized 
on the mainstreet area of Yushima Dr. east side of Tokyo. We must go at 
once!&quot; 

The five girls forgot their differences, as they came together as 
heroes, as a winning team of defenders of Tokyo. The five girls closed 
their eyes, and concentrated, and each one called out the name of her 
planet; 

&quot;Mars power!&quot; Rei yelled. 

&quot;Jupiter power!&quot; Lita yelled. 

&quot;Mercury power!&quot; Amy yelled. 

&quot;Venus power!&quot; Mina yelle. 

&quot;Moon power!&quot; Serena yelled. 

Suddenly the restroom was filled with a bright glow that engulfed the 
five girls. When the glow subsided, in place of the five girls, stood 
the five, valiant Sailor Scouts; Rei; Sailor Mars, Lita, Sailor 
Jupiter, Mina, Sailor Venus, Amy, Sailor Mercury, Serena, Sailor Moon, 
leader of the Scouts, and future queen of earth.
