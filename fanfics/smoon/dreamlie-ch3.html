<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 3 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>The first year for Terri was hard. She constantly wanted to open the 
portal, but couldn&#146;t for fear of the cold entering her world putting 
it to sleep. Terri was always busy, training, designing, or playing in 
the gardens. In those 12 months, she had filled two warehouses with 
dresses, gowns, belts, suits, and any other garment possible to make. 

Without her love and friends there was nothing to do. Terri missed 
Hotaru almost as much as she missed Rei. They would often just run in 
a field and fall, laying down and giggling. (corny me!) When everyone 
wakes, Crystal Tokyo will be built, Serenity and Endymion will marry, 
and the other planets will prosper again. In that time she will have 
become Queen. 

When the 2nd year came, she was 1,118 or 19 in Earth years. Along with 
a new age came new dreams. Odd ones, ones from the past. A past before 
going back to Earth, not remembered. 

&#147; Dragon you must sleep! It&#146;s almost 3 AM !&#148; Taref was worried, 
alright more than worried. His Princess had been getting no sleep for 
the past 11&frac12; months of the second year. Another week and the portal 
could be opened. 

&#147; It&#146;s incurable Taref! Even after so long. It&#146;s like that figure is 
haunting me!&#148; 

&#147; Terrestria! Under the covers now! Don&#146;t let it get to you.&#148; Terri 
nodded at her guardian and got under her periwinkle blankets. Sleep 
reigned supreme soon after and Terri was flung into a fitful sleep. 

**~**~**~**~Her Dream~**~**~**~**~**~**~**~**~**~**~**~

&#147; One more year. Then I can see them again. Especially my Rei.&#148; A 17 
year old Terrestria leaned back on her balcony and sighed. 

&#147; Terrestria?&#148; Startled the young Princess looked at the person behind 
her. 

&#147; Oh it&#146;s only you. You scared me my friend.&#148; Terrestria looked at the 
shadowed figure. She couldn&#146;t see the face and the hair was a really 
odd color. The figure placed a hand on her shoulder as they looked at 
the aligning moons . 

&#147; Those moons represent couples Terrestria.&#148;

&#147; What do you mean?&#148; 

&#147; As the four moons align, forming only two moons, one couple is 
closer than the other.&#148; 

&#147; Who are the couples?&#148;

&#147; Us and whoever gets in the way.&#148; 

The scene fades to a battle scene. A tattered Sailor Terrestrial 
facing the figure from before.

&#147; Why do you fight me Terrestria?&#148;

&#147; Why? You are trying to destroy the one I love!&#148; 

&#147; Your wrong! She will only bring your downfall!&#148;

&#147; You will bring my downfall! Your making this too hard!&#148;

&#147; Why are you so stubborn? She will never fill your heart like me. I 
am the one--&#148; 

&#147; No you don&#146;t. If you did you would be happy for me! It ends here!&#148; 
Energy was swelling in her veins. A rush only brought on by 
protecting. The air turned warm. Black light rose from Terrestrial, 
her hair rising as energy cackled. She started to rise in the air. 
Terrestrial&#146;s large black wings grew 30 ft to 30 ft from wing tip to 
wing tip. Her hair grew and a dress replaced her uniform. The purist 
of blacks. The dress was simple. No sleeves, hugging every curve. 
Flowing behind her as a new symbol of black flared brightly on her 
forehead. A staff appeared, as black as the gown with a strobe on top. 
Terrestrial&#146;s new form looked at her foe.

&#147; Terrestria I don&#146;t understand, what happe--&#148; 

&#147; Coran ti shi va ka!&#148; The foe turned quiet at the Terrestrian words. 

&#147; Tor se ja son qi zine.&#148; The woman glowed black and pointed her 
staff. 

&#147; What? No! Terrestria, you can&#146;t!&#148; The strobe glowed dangerously. 

&#147; Vi tian sha Gia dor win tai va si qe binastra!&#148; 

The figure became shadowed as it screamed, eventually just fading 
until there was nothing. Terrestria changed back as she lowered to the 
ground. She stood for a minute, then her legs gave way. The young 
Princess fell to the ground sobbing at what she had done.

&#147; I couldn&#146;t let you my friend.&#148;

~~*~~*~~* End Dream*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*

Terri sat up, her brow beaded with sweat. Tears streaming down her 
face. 

- Who were you my friend?-

After that night the dream never came back. But it had always just 
been the balcony seen, not the battle. Terri spoke Terrestrian, it was 
her native tongue. Those phrases escaped her though. It didn&#146;t matter, 
the last week went past quickly and Terri stood outside the portal. 
Counting away the minutes she could go through.</pre>
