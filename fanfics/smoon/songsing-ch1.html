<p><u>“<em>The Basics – i.”</em></u></p>
<p>A slender digit slipped  past her lips as in tandem, her tongue slithered forth to greet the  intrusion. A sated grin crawled over her features before a soft, yet  stifled moan broke from her slender throat. With a ripple indicative of  a swallow, the young Asian woman pulled her finger free from her mouth.  After cleaning off the excess sauce that clung to her fingers, the very  same digits slipped through her loosed, dark tresses and pooled them  into a haphazard bun.</p>
<p>‘<em>Makoto – you would be proud’,</em> impressed her thoughts while her eyes took in the main course she had just berthed from her own kitchen. “Perfect...”</p>
<p>Setting  the roast to rest in the center of her dining table, she gave pause.  Her senses had been honed since her teenaged years. After all, she was  part of a select group that was...<em>special</em>. And now, at  twenty-seven, her skills though somewhat dulled, kicked into overdrive  tonight. The baby fine hairs collected at the nape of her neck, stood  on end as the Japanese woman felt eyes roam her every curve. Casually,  she righted herself, while her eyes danced to the far recesses of her  dimly lit domicile. Candles nested in contemporary candelabras  stationed at every nook served as a light source; well – in tandem with  the flickering of the television just tucked in the adjacent living  room.</p>
<p>Her hands clopped gently at her jean covered thighs; fists clenching and unclenching suddenly fully aware that her <em>henshin</em> was nowhere near. She felt naked, vulnerable, a feeling she’s not been familiar with since <em>that</em> night. How the singer longed to erase that mark in her history...  Minako hated this feeling. For as long as she was able, she had been in  control of everything she’s done. Being dependant on someone still  caused an uncomfortable roil in the pit of her stomach.</p>
<p>But...She  felt it, too little too late – a presence behind her. Before the  Japanese woman could fully turn about to face her assailant, her arms  were folded and tucked into her body by two massive ones. The urgency  and strength overwhelmed her – the fears clouded her mind immediately.  Though not as much as his musky, earthen scent.</p>
<p>“...<em>??”, </em>came her breathless reply, “Terry...”, she finally managed half relieved.</p>
<p>“Happy six-month anniversary, baby,” a guttural growl reverberated through her body.</p>
<p>“You  know how I am about being surprised,” she murmured in perfect English;  canting her head to one side as Terry’s lips began to assault the  overly sensitized flesh of her neck. But the sensual salutation was  halted as the sounds of a newscast rung through the abode.</p>
<p>‘<em>Now  for Entertainment news...International Pop Star, Minako Aino is  purportedly reported to conclude her world tour in the land of the  Rising Sun – her native Japan!’</em></p>
<p>‘<em>That should be exciting,  seeing how she’s not been back to Japan in ages – an attempt to  revitalize a slowly waning career, your guess is as good as ours. As I  hear, Tamara – she’s not the top dog to look for any longer.’</em></p>
<p>‘<em>Age  can do that to those names in the spotlight for so long – doesn’t stop  her from being the most well loved icon, eh? But a more important  question arises, how will her Romantically Linked boy toy be received?’</em></p>
<p>‘<em>Perfect  segue, Tamara – And in this week’s Sports Fest, Terry Lapps, aka, the  Lapp-Dawg, of the Atlanta Falcons has once again made his was through  the headlines after another....’</em></p>
<p>The television clicked off  and Minako found herself relieved from her beau’s grip. The hulking  wide receiver for the Falcons lobbed the remote onto the nearest black,  leathered sofa. “just news baby, just news...fucking hounds. GOD!” A  mammoth hand raced over his bald-head before following his comment with  a disgruntled groan.</p>
<p>“...You know how I feel about that Terry.  You really need to -,” Minako’s chiding silenced as the thick pad of  Terry’s singular finger pressed to her lips.</p>
<p>“...Watch my temper, I know...I KNOW. Just can’t stand when they razz you like that.”</p>
<p>The  much taller African American male dipped his head forth and stole a  kiss from the slightly older Japanese woman. Ever since his collegiate  years, Terry had been head over heels in love with Aino Minako, the  Japanese star. He was one of a million, or billions in the world that  worshipped the ground she walked on. Terry perhaps, was borderline  obsessed, to the point where he forced himself to learn her language,  in hopes to one day communicate. Unknown to him at that time – Minako  was already versed well in English.</p>
<p>The almighty shined on him  the day he won the coveted Heismann. Awarded to the best collegiate  Football player. A party had been thrown in his honor; apparently...a  few stars had been rather supportive in his career. One, to his  amazement, had been an actor, who had brought his <em>very </em>popular date with him...The woman that would forever change his life.</p>
<p>“Aino...Minako...”</p>
<p>She  laughed at the sound of her name, coated with a Georgian accent; her  chocolate eyes erupted in a dazzling twinkle; he loved everything about  her. That laugh, her lightly colored hair, that infectious smile. Even  the ever slight ‘crow’s feet’ that graced the corner of her eyes... Her  beauty was non comparative. Ethereal.</p>
<p>“I lov...”, he was never allowed to finish. With a negation offered with just a look from her eyes, he groaned.</p>
<p>“It’s how I FEEL Minako, why can’t I <em>say </em>ithuh?”</p>
<p>Minako  tenderly smiled, and brushed her lips over his brow. Walking backward,  she tugged him by his hand, “Dinner is getting cold.”</p>
<p>With a  sigh, he shrugged grudgingly, he knew better than to pursue talking to  a brick wall. Settling himself at the nearest seat, Terry began to  feed. “<em>almost</em> better’n momma’s southern dishes, babe...Can’t be your recipe though,” a teasing comment no less.</p>
<p>Minako  rolled her eyes and nursed her own morsels, before stabbing at her  plate and offering curtly, “If you have to know, hai...It’s a <em>friend’s</em>.”</p>
<p>Terry nodded before easing himself off his seat and ambled his way at Minako’s side.</p>
<p>She  hadn’t realized her younger lover was knelt at her side, till she felt  the gentle pressure of his gruff hand supporting the butt of her chin.  Lifting her gaze, she met his.</p>
<p>“You do more than most friends would, Minako – Be thankful you didn’t lose complete contact with them, eh?”</p>
<p>...<em>somewhat...</em></p>
<p>For all his bravada on the playing field, a temper that rivals her <em>friend’s</em> own – <em>she felt a gentle tug of her lips at the thought of her -</em> and loathing of the paparazzi, Terry was a gentle, understanding soul. She was...<em>glad</em>...to have found him at a time she needed <em>someone</em>. He, figuratively saved her.</p>
<p>Those  errant thoughts were shoved from her mind forcibly. She had to  concentrate to bring her back to the now of it all. Decimating the  cobwebs from her mind, the Japanese woman nodded shakily. He was right  of course. There were times she had forgotten their faces, but never  their effervescent voices. Though her calls had become infrequent, they  were always there.</p>
<p>Save for one.</p>
<p>From what she understood, she wouldn’t be the only one returning home for their <em>reunion</em>.</p>
<p>But will <em>she </em>return also? All Minako had of or even remotely <em>from </em>her, were the occasional one-lined electronic mails, and an old photo from their teenaged years. It was from a show <em>she</em> had manipulated to get the idol on to. A photo that was frayed at the  edges and never left her wallet. One cherished possession of a  childhood friend.</p>
<p><em>At least...she writes</em>.<em> Well...wrote.</em></p>
<p>But  four moths had passed since their last correspondence. Longer still, as  she’s not heard her friend’s voice, nor seen how she’s grown. But,  Minako reasoned silently, she should have known. Both she and her  friend had devout passions for what they did. It’s not a wonder that  they, in particular had drifted. Though Minako’s particular occupation  made her accessible through the mass media, the others had kept tabs.  Who <em>knew</em> where the miko was now...</p>
<p>‘<em>Deli’,</em> one had written.</p>
<p>‘<em>Papua New Guinea,’ </em>another had said one night over the phone.</p>
<p>‘<em>Where’s that?’,</em> joined the final, vacuous reply.</p>
<p>She had laughed then.</p>
<p>Breathing  in and exhaling slowly, Minako afforded a slight bob of her head in  acknowledgment to the knelt man. “I...I’m sorry,” was her all too soft  reply. Stiffening her back, the worldly Songstress glanced to a  photograph placed precariously on a nearby mantle, “It’s been so  long...”</p>
<p>Young, vibrant and alive. They were all given a second  chance at life. There they sat, all five faces grinning broadly. All,  were eagerly looking forward to conquering their given realms.</p>
<p>“...People  change, baby,” offered Terry gently as if reading her mind, Minako was  tugged back, “Yeah you miss ‘em, but don’t expect too much to stay the  same huh? Especially with <em>that</em> one.” She didn’t need to see who he had meant, her descriptions of the would-be miko painted a raw picture.</p>
<p>“No offense, I wouldn’t wanna meet her on her best day – she ever smile?”</p>
<p>The  icon had gone silent, pondering a good deal on how to convey herself.  For all the times they had shared and all the little tirades they’ve  had with one another, only one answer would suffice.</p>
<p>And it came  as a gentle caress of emotion, which dusted over Minako’s lips. She  smiled knowingly before returning to her meal. The truth of the matter  was...deeply seeded within her, she yearned to see that chased smile  that the miko hid.</p>
<p>Would she ever see it again, was the sole question that remained.</p>
