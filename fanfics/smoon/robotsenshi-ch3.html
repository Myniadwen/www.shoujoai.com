<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Hino-Yasha</em></span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>The screen fizzes to  show a set, where the authoress is</em> <em>directing a well-used  parody….</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Okay, now <strong>this</strong> is getting ridiculous.” Rei growled at Tempestflame, her new dog  ears twitching in anger. She stuffed her arms into the billowy  sleeves of her red haori.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is <strong>so</strong> not canon.” Usagi murmured, dressed in traditional miko garb, her  hair for once not in her normal hairstyle. Instead, it was pulled  back in a low ponytail at the base of her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So!” Tempestflame  said. “You guys aren't canon pairings!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey,” Ami  shrugged, her short blue hair gathered in a rattail and dressed in  monk's robes, the black and purple fabric flowing around her body, “I  have no complaints. Now, I have leave to do this-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami reached behind an  unsuspecting Makoto and groped her behind.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto jumped ten feet  in the air and backed away from Ami, a shocked look on her face. Ami  looked innocent as she held up her right gloved hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I was in character.”  She explained.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Riiiiight.” Makoto  droned, tugging on the high neck of her demon-slayer suit, the black  leather hugging her athletic form.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well,” Minako  sighed, the school uniform leaving little to the imagination. “Let's  get this over with.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Aw poor Mina-chan.”  Setsuna cooed, her black-green hair pulled into a high ponytail at  the top of her head, her body covered in wolves' fur and armor. “When  the chapter ends, I'll make it up to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako perked up at  that. “On with the show!” she exclaimed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Annndddd….ACTION!”  Tempestflame shouted into her megaphone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“She left again.  Didn't she Minako.” Ami, the perverted miko asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako sniffled and  snuggled into Setsuna, the wolf demon princess, when she put an arm  around the sad school girl.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“S-she did.  Hino-Yasha left for Usagi.” Minako said.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto, the only demon  slayer left, growled and cracked her knuckles.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How dare she!” she  hissed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But…well…”  Minako started timidly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is it  Mina-chan?” Setsuna asked softly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It's just…it  doesn't hurt like I thought it would.” Minako murmured. “I don't  feel sad, knowing Hin- I mean Rei-chan chose Usagi over me. Really.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She turned a soft  loving look at Setsuna. “In fact, I feel happier.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setsuna blinked, then  blushed at the girl's adoring gaze. “H-happy?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah.” Minako  whispered, curling up into Setsuna's lap, a soft smile gracing her  features. “Happy.” She murmured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>Usagi…</em> She was  all Rei could think about. Yes, she felt horrible about leaving  Minako at the campsite, but she just didn't see the schoolgirl in  that light.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei landed on a branch  and sniffed the air, catching Usagi's scent and dashing off to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The half-demon landed  in a small grove of trees, secluded from the outside world. Usagi lay  curled in the curve of two branches. An ethereal light surrounded  her, making her ivory skin glow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Baby-blue eyes blinked  open and focused on her. Usagi smiled that small pained smile of hers  and gently hopped down.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hello Rei.” She  whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei looked down at the  ground, shame creeping up her spine. She closed her eyes and forced  back tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She lost it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Letting out a miserable  cry, she scooped the startled blonde into her arms and buried her  face in Usagi's hair. They sank to their knees, Rei whispering, “I'm  sorry.” over and over again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei.” Usagi  ordered. “Rei, there's nothing to forgive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi hugged the  sobbing half-demon closer and laid her forehead on Rei's shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“There's nothing to  forgive.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“WAHHHHHHH!!”  Tempest-chan sobbed as she blew her nose. “You guys were great!”  The authoress burst into a whole new round of tears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hino-Yasha' scoffed  and wrapped an arm around Usagi's shoulders, blushing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Guys,” Makoto  asked. “Where's Minako and Setsuna?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They were all silent  before Tempestflame moaned out,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <strong><em>really</em></strong> don't want to know…”</span></p>
