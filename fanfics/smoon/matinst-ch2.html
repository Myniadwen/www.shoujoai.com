<h1>Maternal Instinct (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/krysbear.html">Krys Bear</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/matinst-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Authors Notes: This fic takes place approximately 8 months after
Makoto and Minako have &#39;hooked up.&#39; They are both seventeen years
old.

I&#39;d like to thank Chrono Cross for the one irresistible line I just had to
steal for my own. Kudos to those who know which one I&#39;m talking
about.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;What in Kami&#39;s name are we going to do?&quot; Mars whispered, staring
down at the sleeping toddler. &quot;We have to find a way to change her
back!&quot;

Mercury pushed her way to the front, and kneeled down in front of little
Makoto. &quot;Just give me a minute, everybody. Move back and let me see
just what happened.&quot; The scouts complied, and Ami pulled out her
henshin wand. She then began to prod Makoto mindlessly with it. The
little girl kicked out sleepily at the source of her discomfort.

&quot;She&#39;s not a science experiment Mercury!&quot; Sailor Mars pushed her way
up to the front, and snatched Ami&#39;s henshin wand out of her hand. &quot;How
is poking her going to help anybody?&quot;

Mercury shook her head, her clouded eyes clearing. She cleared her
throat. &quot;I&#39;m sorry everybody. I just....I guess I just couldn&#39;t believe my
eyes for a minute there. She really is a child!&quot; Mars rolled her eyes
while Mercury pulled out her supercomputer. &quot;I&#39;m going to scan her, and
see what kind of readings I pick up. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a way to reverse
this.&quot; Her fingers flew across the keys, and the compact wonder began
making odd beeping noises. The genius senshi&#39;s brow furrowed as she
absorbed all the information she was receiving, her geek brain in full
throttle.

&quot;Well?&quot; Moon asked after a few moments of electronic noise. &quot;Are you
getting anything?&quot;

Mercury nodded. &quot;Yes. Physically she is five years and four months in
age. Her strength is five times that of a normal little girl at the same age,
but I was expecting to see that. What really bothers me is the fact that
mentally, she&#39;s five years old as well. This whole thing would be a lot
easier if it was only her body that was affected by this...thing. I&#39;ve got a
lot of data here, but I&#39;m not seeing the direct cause for her
transformation, and until I can pinpoint that, I can&#39;t find a way to reverse
it.&quot;

Mars&#39; left eyebrow twitched. &quot;So what exactly is it that you&#39;re saying
here, Mercury? That we can&#39;t fix her? That Sailor Jupiter is going to be
running around fighting youmas in diapers?!&quot;

Mercury scowled. &quot;Of course not! She&#39;s five years old, Mars. She&#39;s been
out of diapers for quite a while now!&quot;

Moon and Mars stared at Mercury, and facefaulted. &quot;Er...sorry.&quot; The
blue senshi whispered. &quot;But you have to understand that I just need a
little more time with this. I won&#39;t rest until I find a way to reform her,
but until then, you&#39;re all going to have to be patient. I have all of the
data I need from her for now.&quot; She closed her computer with a snap. &quot;I&#39;m
sure it won&#39;t take long. But in the meantime, we have to deal with the
immediate problem this presents.&quot;

&quot;That being?&quot;

&quot;How are we going to watch over her until we fix this? As far as I know,
she doesn&#39;t have any family around here that could take care of her. And
even if she did, how would we explain this to them? Her parents are
dead, and she lives on her own. But she&#39;s far too young to be able to
take care of herself now. Which means its up to us.&#148;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot; Sailor Moon sat down beside Makoto, and cradled her in
her arms. &quot;We&#39;ll each take turns taking care of her. You know she&#39;d be
the first to do the same for us. When Mercury figures out what
happened, we can change her back, and everything will go back to
normal. It shouldn&#39;t be any trouble.&quot; The other two senshi nodded in
agreement.

&quot;My mother&#39;s usually gone all weekend, working at the hospital.&quot;
Mercury said. &quot;So I can keep her Saturday and most of Sunday.&#148;

&quot;We&#39;re having a fundraiser at the temple tomorrow, &quot; Mars spoke out.
&quot;Lots of things to do for kids. It might be best if I took her for tonight
and tomorrow, so she wouldn&#39;t get bored. Then we can switch her over
tomorrow night.&quot;

Sailor Moon nodded. &quot;All right then, it&#146;s settled. Makoto will stay at
the temple tonight. That&#39;s one of our problems taken care of. Now for
the harder one.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about, odango-head?&quot;

&quot;Shut up Mars!&quot; She turned to Mercury. &quot;Just how are we going to
break this to Minako?&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Minako paced around her bedroom, glancing at the clock. &quot;Something
must have gone wrong, Artemis. It&#39;s been almost two hours. Makoto
would have been back by now.&quot; She stormed to her dresser to get her
henshin pen.

&quot;I&#39;m going out after them!&quot;

Artemis stood up and stretched. &quot;Just give them a few more minutes
Mina. If something had come up and they needed you, they would have
called you by now. Usagi probably just needed an ice cream cone or
something, so they&#39;re taking a little longer. Do you know what your
mother will do if she catches you sneaking out again?&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;I KNOW Artemis. I can&#39;t help it though. I feel like
something&#39;s terribly, terribly wrong.&quot;

&quot;Minako,&quot; Artemis started, &quot;you know, you might just be paran-&quot;

He was cut off by the sound of Minako&#39;s communicator beeping. The
blond leapt to it, opening it before it was even fully in her hand. &quot;What&#39;s
wrong?&quot; She asked. &quot;Is everyone ok?&quot;

Usagi&#39;s face grinned awkwardly back at her. &quot;Well, er...umm...nobody is
hurt, so you don&#39;t have to worry about that, Mina. But we do have
something real important like to discuss, so we&#39;re going to meet at the
Shinto shrine in a half hour. I hate to ask you to come, because I know
how much trouble you&#39;re already in, but there&#39;s no way around it.&#148;
Minako heard her sigh. &quot;You just have to be here.&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Usagi. I&#39;ll handle my mother. I&#39;ll
meet you all there in half an hour.&quot; The communicator clicked off,
leaving Minako only partially relieved.

&quot;There&#39;s something they&#39;re not telling me, Artemis.&quot; She slipped her
Senshi gear into her coat pocket. &quot;Usagi looked pretty flipped out. We
have to meet at the temple in half an hour.&quot; She pulled her backpack out
of her closet and opened it. &quot;I have to climb out the window again, so
you&#39;re going to have to ride in here for a while, kitty.&#148;

Artemis groaned. The only thing worse than riding in Minako&#39;s
backpack with all her disorganized belongings slamming into his little
body was the thought of Mrs. Aino&#39;s loving arms. &quot;I heard, Mina. I&#39;ll get
in when I absolutely have to.&quot;

&quot;Ok.&quot; The blond took a deep breath, and pulled a small packet of
powder from underneath her bed. &quot;I&#39;m not allowed out of my room, so I
need you to take care of mom this time, Artemis. Luckily enough I got
her to unlock the door for me earlier when I had to go to the bathroom.&quot;
She measured out a small portion of the powder and poured it into a
vial. &quot;Do you think you can handle it?&quot;

The cat did a little spin. &quot;I&#39;ve done just fine before. No reason I
shouldn&#39;t be able to this time.&quot; He took the tiny vial from her and held it
between his teeth.

&quot;All right.&quot; Mina quietly slipped the door open, and let the stealth cat
out. &quot;Get back here as soon as you can. We have to move fast.&quot;

The cat grunted, and flew down the hall. He loved it when he got to be
the one to drug Mrs. Aino&#39;s nightcap. It was a small revenge for all the
odd abuses he suffered at the woman&#39;s hand.

Not to mention the fact he was just a sick little kitty sometimes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As soon as he hit the stairway, Artemis slipped into Navy Seal mode.
He sniffed the air, trying to determine his target&#39;s exact location in the
downstairs living quarters. Soundlessly he crept down the stairs, taking
every care in making sure he kept his jaw closed around the precious
vial.

He heard the television blaring, and knew Mrs. Aino was watching one
of her evening sitcoms before going to bed. The woman was a witch, in
every sense of the word, but at least she had the decency to be a
predictable one. It made this whole mission a lot simpler.

Mrs. Aino&#39;s nightcap rested on the coffee table, only three paces away
from the woman herself. Shit, the cat thought to himself. There&#39;s no way
I can slip anything in there without getting her attention.

He crouched behind a plant in the corner of the room, and waited. Mrs.
Aino was a midnight snacker, and her bowl of cheezy poofs was almost
empty. Chances are she&#39;d go refill it on the next commercial, giving him
a golden opportunity.

The next commercial came, and just as predicted, Mrs. Aino picked up
her bowl and made her way into the kitchen. As soon as she was out of
the room, Artemis leapt up onto the table and tilted his head, pouring
the powder out of the vial and into her drink. It blended in with the rich
liquid perfectly, and had no flavor that could give its presence away. It
would take effect within minutes, and Mrs. Aino would be out cold for
the night. Chances are she&#39;d fall asleep right on the couch, and not even
make it into her bedroom. It was a potent drug, but harmless. Minako&#39;d
used it a fair number of times on her mother, in situations like this.

Senshi business comes first.

Artemis jumped down off of the table and spit the vial out of his mouth,
and batted it under the couch. Minako would take care of it as soon as
things were stable again. He heard heavy footsteps coming out of the
kitchen, and he high tailed it, running as fast as his little legs could
carry him for the stairs.

He turned around to see if Mrs. Aino had seen him. He looked a little
longer than he should have, however, and before he could right himself,
he sailed headfirst into the plant he&#39;d been hiding behind just moments
ago.

&quot;Artemis?&quot; A grating voice called out. &quot;Is that you?&quot;

The kitty in question lay, dazed under a pile of dirt and roots. The plant
pot was thrown clear across the room, and there was green leaves and
mess strewn everywhere. Oh no. Please no. Kami, don&#39;t let her get me.

Mrs. Aino stood up, and finished off her drink, making Artemis sigh
with relief. At least she had the drugs in her system. The wonderful,
beautiful drugs. &quot;It was you!&quot; She squawked, rushing over to clean up
the mess. &quot;Bad kitty!&quot; She waved her finger in his face. &quot;Very very bad!
Now mommy has to clean up all this mess. And look what you did to
poor Mr. Plant!&quot; She pulled the plant off of his head, and did her best to
place it back into the pot.

Artemis shook himself off and tried to slink away, before the woman
noticed. No such luck.

&quot;You come here you silly kitty,&quot; she cooed, and picked him up. &quot;You
were just so excited you needed to run and play, didn&#39;t you? Yes you
did, frisky little kitty.&quot; She began to make kissy noises at him and
stroke his head. &quot;Now you sit down here with mommy and watch the
nice movie. And you settle down!&quot; She poked his nose. &quot;You know that
kind of thing is for outside play.&quot;

Artemis cringed as Mrs. Aino carried him to the couch, all the while
talking to him in that silly little voice that made his ears bleed.

Come on drugs! He prayed. Hurry up and knock the bitch down!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;STRANGERS!&quot; The feisty little girl shouted, kicking out with all her
might. &quot;You&#39;re bad people! Bad people!&quot; she snarled, biting Ami&#39;s
elbow. &quot;Now you let me go, or I&#39;ll kick your arses so hard you&#39;ll kiss the
moons!&quot;

Crying out in pain, Ami let go of little Makoto, who promptly sprinted
for the temple door. Rei leapt forward and tackled her down before she
could reach it, causing the toddler to roar and begin pounding on the
priestess with her tiny fists. Rei held fast throughout the rain of blows,
desperate to calm the girl down. &quot;Usagi!&quot; She yelled. &quot;Lock the doors
and give me a hand here!&quot;

Usagi ran and secured the doors, making sure Makoto couldn&#39;t escape.
Then she rushed over to check on Ami, who was holding a cloth to her
elbow and wincing. &quot;Are you ok Ami?&quot; she asked, concerned.

The blue haired geek nodded. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; She pointed to Rei and
Makoto. The little girl had two handfuls of Rei&#39;s hair in her fists, and
was tugging for all she was worth. &quot;Go and help them!&quot;

&quot;Let me go! Makoto shouted, red faced and livid. &quot;You let me go right
now or my mom and dad are going to be really mad!&quot; Rei struggled to
free her raven locks from the child&#39;s clenched fists.

Usagi kneeled down beside the two and put her hands on top of
Makoto&#39;s much smaller ones. &quot;Mako-chan...Makoto. Please, stop and
listen for a minute. We&#39;re not bad people, and we&#39;re not going to hurt
you.&quot;

Under Usagi&#39;s gentle touch, the little girl&#39;s hands loosened their death
grip. Even as a child, there was something in her that simple wouldn&#39;t
allow her to try to hurt her princess. She looked up at the senshi leader,
uncertainty reflected in her eyes. &quot;Where&#39;s my mom and dad?&quot; she
asked, looking around the room.

Usagi nearly broke into tears at that point. Makoto&#39;s was back at a point
in her life before the plane crash, when her parents were still alive. How
could she be the one to tell the girl her parents were dead, for a second
time? It just wasn&#39;t possible.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; Usagi said, her voice almost catching. &quot;You&#39;re parents are
gone...for a little while. They had to go away on a business trip. Do you
know what that is?&quot;

The brunette scampered out from underneath Rei and nodded. &quot;Yeah.
Daddy has to go on those lots. He always brings me back a present
when he comes home.&quot;

Ok. I made a good choice there. She knows what I&#39;m saying. Now if I
can just get her to trust us. &quot;Right, so that&#39;s where your daddy is. Your
mommy went with him this time, and she put us in charge of taking care
of you until they get back.

&quot;So you&#39;re my babysitter?&quot; The girl asked, still a little skeptical.

&quot;That&#39;s right. Now, if you come over here, &quot; she motioned to the large
tatami mat that sat in the middle of Rei&#39;s room, &quot;we can all tell you our
names, so we won&#39;t be strangers anymore.&quot;

Makoto nodded, and toddled over to the mat and sat down with her legs
crossed.

Ami and Rei followed, sitting directly across from the girl. &quot;Sorry I
bited your arm off,&quot; Makoto said to Ami, as she looked down at the
floor.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; the small senshi replied, ruffling Mako&#39;s already very
mussed bangs. &quot;You just didn&#39;t know what was going on.&quot;

Usagi came and sat down beside her as she was giving Rei a similar
apology. The priestess had come out of it in worse shape than Ami, with
a small bruise forming on her cheek, and a trickle of blood coming
down from her ear, where Makoto had tugged it. The dark haired senshi
grunted in response, and snatched Ami&#39;s towel out of her hands to clean
herself up with. It wasn&#39;t that she was angry at Makoto for attacking her,
it was just that her pride was injured due to the fact the little girl gave
her so much trouble.

&quot;All right Makoto,&quot; Usagi started, &quot;I&#39;ll introduce myself first. My name
is Tsukino Usagi.&quot; She let the girl practice pronouncing her name a few
times before she continued. &quot;That girl whose &#39;arm you bit off&#39; ...her
name is Mizuno Ami. And that grouchy one beside Ami,&quot; she pointed at
the fire senshi, &quot;is Hino Rei. She works with her grandfather to run this
shrine. You&#39;ll be staying here with her tonight.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s eyes grew wide and she shuffled behind Usagi. &quot;Don&#39;t wanna
stay here tonight,&quot; the little girl mumbled. &quot;Wanna stay with you.&quot;

Ami quirked an eyebrow, and Rei sighed. Maybe this wasn&#39;t going to be
as easy as they thought. &quot;Do you like ice cream, Makoto?&quot; Rei asked,
hoping she could score the way Usagi did.

Makoto&#39;s eyes lit up. &quot;Yeah! I like ice cream, and candies and cookies!&#148;

&quot;Well I don&#39;t know about cookies and candies, but I do know we have
some ice cream with sprinkles in the kitchen.&quot; Rei stood up, and held
out her hand. &quot;Do you want to come with me and get some?&quot;

Makoto looked up at Usagi, who nodded and motioned for her to
follow. She leapt to her feet, and snagged Rei&#39;s hand, successfully
bribed. Ami gave Rei the thumbs up sign, and let out a sigh of relief. &quot;It
might be a good idea to keep her in there until after we&#39;ve talked to
Minako, Rei. I don&#39;t think it would do at all to have her just walk in and
see you-know-who like that.&quot;

Makoto looked up at Rei, puzzled. &quot;Who&#39;s Minako? Is she gonna watch
me too?&quot;

Rei shuffled out of the room, giving a nod of affirmation. She&#39;d keep
Makoto busy with ice cream long enough for the others to explain
everything to Minako. In all honesty, she was glad she wasn&#39;t the one
who had to tell the blond.

&quot;Speaking of Minako,&quot; Usagi started with a giggle, &quot;it looks like she&#39;s
picking up my lovely habits. I wonder, what&#39;s taking her so long?&quot;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Artemis yowled in pain as Minako&#39;s heavy math book struck him in the
head. &quot;Mina, are we far enough away yet? Let me out of here!&quot;

&quot;Sorry Artemis,&quot; the blond said and stopped, letting him out of his
canvas prison. &quot;I forgot.&quot;

The duo picked up the pace and continued speeding towards the Hikawa
shrine. &quot;We&#39;re almost there,&quot; Artemis huffed as the monstrous staircase
came into view. &quot;About how late do you think we are?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I don&#39;t know,&quot; Minako replied sarcastically. &quot;You&#39;re little &#39;fun time&#39;
with my mom put us behind about twenty minutes. I&#39;d have to say we&#39;re
at least a half hour late now.&quot;

Artemis scowled. &quot;Don&#39;t you dare start acting like it was my fault,
Minako! Do you have any idea what it was like, stuck there in the arms
of that horrible beast who gave birth to you? &#39;Fun time&#39;, you call it?
Molestation is a much better word!&quot;

They bounded up the stairs, taking them two at a time. &quot;Well if you had
been a little more careful, instead of playing spy cat, you never would
have knocked over her stupid plant! Then we could have been out of
there right away, instead of waiting for her to pass out from the dope so
you could get away!&quot;

They were still bickering when they reached the entrance to the temple.
Minako knew it wasn&#39;t the cat&#39;s fault. He always did the best he could,
but she couldn&#39;t shake the worried feeling she had. Not to mention the
fact she prided herself on being the leader of the senshi, aside from
Usagi, and it made her look bad to be showing up at important meetings
late.

She stood in front of the door to Rei&#39;s room, and knocked three times.
Artemis jumped up and took his usual place on her shoulder, still sore
about the whole incident.

Ami opened the door, a plastic smile plastered across her face. &quot;Minako,
come in. We were just wondering where you were.&quot;

&quot;Yeah!&quot; Usagi agreed, the same cheesy smile on her own face. &quot;Did you
have a hard time getting away from your mom?&quot;

Minako looked at Artemis, and then back at her fellow senshi. &quot;A little.
But don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s all taken care of now.&quot; Her mind flashed back to the
last image she had of her mother before she&#39;d snuck out - laying with
her bathrobe half hanging open and a trail of drool making its way down
her chin as an old episode of some Japanese soap opera blared from the
television set. She shuddered at the recollection.

&quot;So,&quot; the perky blond sat down and took off her coat and shoes.
&quot;Where&#39;s Rei and Mako-chan?&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; Usagi let out a high pitched laugh and nervously scratched her
neck. &quot;Don&#39;t you worry; they&#39;ll be out in a few minutes! But before they
do...umm...there&#39;s something Ami needs to tell you.&quot;

Ami paled and threw up her hands. &quot;No, no, I have NOTHING to say at
all. Usagi, I thought we agreed you&#39;d be the one to tell her?&quot; she
scowled.

&quot;Oh, no we didn&#39;t,&quot; Usagi quickly picked up. &quot;You told me you wanted
to do it, remember?&quot; She elbowed Ami and waggled her eyebrows.
&quot;Since _you&#39;re_ the one who knows all the technical terms and all.&quot;

&quot;No way!&quot; Ami stood up and backed away from the very confused
Minako and Usagi. &quot;You&#39;re the princess, so she&#39;s not allowed to hurt
you! I don&#39;t have that kind of protection! Now you tell her about
Makoto!&quot;

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with Makoto?!&quot; Minako stood up, eyes filled with panic.
&quot;I thought you said no one was hurt!&quot; She started to run to the door.
&quot;Mako-chan!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Usagi imitated the tackle Rei&#39;d used on Mako earlier, and brought
Minako down by the ankles. &quot;You can&#39;t go in there!&quot;

Minako throw Usagi off and scrambled up, trying to open the door with
Ami now tugging at her as well. &quot;Let me go see her!&quot; She cried out,
pushing the nerd away. &quot;Makoto!&quot;

Suddenly Rei&#39;s voice was heard from the other side of the door. &quot;Did
you guys tell her what&#39;s going on yet? I can&#39;t keep her cooped up in here
much longer...she&#39;s going ballistic!&quot; In the background a muffled child&#39;s
voice could be heard, along with a large amount of banging and
clashing.

Ami swallowed hard. Not only did they have a five year old Makoto to
deal with, now they had a sugar high five year old Makoto to deal with.
Dear Kami, what could they have done to deserve that?

&quot;Rei!&quot; Usagi yelled. &quot;Hold the door closed! Minako doesn&#39;t know yet!&quot;

Muffled curses and the sound of Rei slumping against the door. &quot;You
idiot! You&#39;ve had plenty of time! Hurry up and just spit it out!&quot;

Knowing that this task really did fall upon her shoulders, Usagi grabbed
Minako and looked her in the eyes. &quot;Mina-chan, Makoto isn&#39;t hurt. Now
just listen to me, and stay calm. She&#39;s just a little bit...smaller now, than
she was earlier. And she likes ice cream a little more. But Ami is going
to fix her, so she should only be this way for a few days, tops. So, no
worries, and-&quot;

&quot;Geez Usagi!&quot; Ami growled. &quot;Just shut up. I&#39;ll tell her myself!&quot; She
turned to Minako. &quot;Mina, we found this strange youma in the
abandoned warehouse. It&#39;s like nothing we ever faced before, and
Makoto, well, you know Mako-chan. She was the first to take it on.
There was this blinding flash of light, and then...Makoto was suddenly
five years old, and we don&#39;t know why. But I promise, I swear, I will get
her back to her normal self!&quot;

A thud was heard from Rei&#39;s side of the door. &quot;I wanna go back and see
Usagi now! Move out of the way, or I&#39;ll have ta get rough with ya!&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Minako whispered in disbelief. &quot;You&#39;re joking, right Ami?&quot;
She began to laugh hysterically. &quot;That was good, you really had me
going you three! Makoto...five years old...for no real reason at all...&quot;
tears of laughter formed at the corners of her eyes. &quot;Thanks you guys, I
really needed a laugh.&quot; She faced the door. &quot;You can come out not
Mako-chan...wow, you really had me going for a minute. You get an &#39;A&#39;
for effort.&quot;

The sound of Rei sighing was heard as the door unlocked. &quot;All right
Makoto...you heard Minako. Come on out so she can see you now.&#148;

A few scuffles were heard as Makoto bounded through the doorway, a
bit of chocolate sauce and a sprinkle stuck to her cheek. &quot;Hullo,&quot; she
said, giving Minako a toothy grin. &quot;My name is Kino Makoto. I just ate
three whole bowls of ice cream.&quot;

Minako looked at Makoto, then to Rei, and Usagi.

Then she fainted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

More Notes: My muse is crazy, but I am a slave to her whims. I decided
to try and see if I could capture Minako a little more in this fic, and give
her some much needed character development. I&#39;m tired of her being
represented as an eternally happy airhead. Maybe it&#39;s me, but I just think
she&#39;s a little bit deeper than that. ;)

Althought it may not seem so now, this fic is going to be very
lighthearted, in contrast to my other current fic, Purgatory. I hope that
this satisfies all of my readers who don&#39;t like my darker work as much.
=)

This fic is dedicated to everyone who took the time to e-mail me and let
me know what they thought of my writing, and give helpful suggestions.
You all know who you are.
