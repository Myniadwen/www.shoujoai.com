<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 1 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Senshi were standing in the large backyard of the Mansion. 
Terrestria, Darien and the crew of the &#145;Tarefa&#146; were preparing to 
leave. 

&#147; Must you go?&#148; Serena was more than a little sad.

&#147; I&#146;m sorry Serenity but I&#146;ll be bringing the portal in just two days. 
You&#146;ll see Endymion then.&#148; Terri was slightly amused by the blonde. 
She&#146;d asked that question 20 times in the last 3 hours. Always getting 
the same answer. 

&#147; Now everyone say goodbye one more time. When I get the portal here 
I&#146;ll give you all the tour.&#148; They smiled and hugged again. Terri 
kissed Rei on the forehead and told her and Serena just 2 days. The 
siblings boarded the &#146;Tarefa&#146; and in ten seconds were gone from view. 

- Gone- Rei sighed and Ami pulled her inside.

&#147; Rei it&#146;s only two days. Your almost as bad as Serena.&#148;

&#147; I know but I&#146;ve waited way more than 1,000 years to be with her. I 
hate waiting longer. Especially since the whole Dradian thing is over. 
And he kept her more than 2 months, then a week because she was 
unconscious.&#148; Ami turned to Rei and lifted her chin. 

&#147; Buck up. Just two days. Why don&#146;t you go train or something? Someone 
will come get you when Lita&#146;s done cooking.&#148;

&#147; Ok, thanks Ames. I&#146;ll just go swimming.&#148;

*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Captain Zowarek had set the ship on Autopilot so everyone could 
change. Terri had led Darien to his chamber and left for her own. 
Terri dropped her bag on her Four poster bed and went to her walk in 
closet. She took out a black dress. It had a low straight neckline to 
where the sleeves puffed lightly on her tan shoulders. The black of 
the gown got lighter as it went down and flowed gently around her. A 
pair of midnight black high heels on her feet. Her silver-chestnut in 
a ponytail from which hung 2 braids to the middle of her back. 

- All done&#133;I really need to change the dress code&#133;.-

Time had altered itself. It no longer took a day to get to Earth from 
Terrestrial and vice-versa. Only 3 hours. One hour gone getting 
changed to Royal garb. 

- Now to see brother.- Terrestria went to find her brother. He met her 
half way. 

&#147; Oh Endymion! Just like a thousand years ago.&#148;

&#147; Yea, only now your 18 and going to be Queen in 3 years.&#148;

&#147; Quite true, come on there&#146;s only 2 hours to home.&#148;

&#147; 2 hours? I thought you said when you came that it took 24?&#148;

&#147; I did, but we no longer have to go through another dimension since 
the times are almost the same.&#148;

&#147;Almost?&#148;

&#147; Yea, until Earth is aware of magic again, a 1,000 years there is 2 
years on Terrestrial. Soon though.&#148; 

Endymion nodded and sat down across from her in a cozy room. 
Terrestria pulled out a box and conjured a table between them. The box 
said Monopoly on it. (teehee)

&#147; How do you know about Monopoly?&#148;

&#147; Research. I couldn&#146;t come to Earth not knowing everything.&#148;

&#147; Ok, I get to be the money pot!&#148; She grinned and pulled out the money 
pot &amp; dog. 

&#147; Now you lose big brother.&#148;

&#147; We&#146;ll see little sister.&#148;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Captain Zowarek walked to the room where his Princess was. He came to 
a very comical sight. Princess Terrestria looked as if she could jump 
for joy with the grin she had on and all her giggling. On the other 
hand Prince Endymion looked shocked and surprised. The Princess 
noticed the Captain and stopped giggling long enough to say &#147; 
Bankrupt&#148; and point to her brother.

&#147;*chuckle* I see, well we land in ten your Majesties.&#148;

&#147; Great, thank you Captain Zowarek.&#148; The Captain went back to the 
cockpit laughing.

Ten minutes later they were standing in front of Black Diamond Castle. 
Prince Endymion stared in awe, even though he was still mad for 
losing.

&#147; Come on I wanna see Taref!&#148;

&#147; Isn&#146;t that the ship?&#148;

&#147; The ship was named after his mother. You&#146;ll see.&#148;

And indeed he did see. Waiting with servants and guards was a 
panther-like creature only larger. A white patch of fur in the middle 
of it&#146;s forehead showed the sign of Terrestrial. It&#146;s green eyes 
brightened when it saw the Princess.

&#147; Taref!&#148; The panther practically ran to her at sight. Terrestria 
opened her arms and the big cat stood to hug her. They stayed like 
that for a second and broke apart.

&#147; Brother this is Taref. My guardian.&#148;

&#147; Hello Taref, nice to meet you.&#148; Taref looked up.

&#147; Like wise Prince Endymion. Terrestria how was Earth?&#148;

&#147; Great! The others are watching UN for me.&#148;

The 3 started walking around showing Endymion the palace. After 
dinner, Taref joined Terrestria in her quarters. Turning his back as 
she changed.

&#147; Taref how long will his training be?&#148;

&#147; Just a month. There isn&#146;t much to learn.&#148;

&#147; Good it&#146;ll be over just in time for the Meteor. You can turn around 
now.&#148; He did so and jumped on her huge bed.

&#147; So&#133;on Earth did you see Princess Rei?&#148; Terri blushed.

&#147; Yes.&#148;

&#147; And&#133;?&#148; Her blush went crimson. Taref chuckled.

&#147; I see, good. The people will have great rulers.&#148; Terrestria&#146;s blush 
went a deeper shade if possible. 

&#147; Taref! We haven&#146;t even been on a date yet!&#148;

&#147; Well aren&#146;t you her girlfriend?&#148;

&#147; Yes&#133;but I shouldn&#146;t even be talking to you about my love life.&#148; She 
giggled and kissed the white patch of fur.

&#147; Goodnight Taref.&#148;

&#147; Goodnight Dragon.&#148; A last giggle came from Terrestria as at the 
sound of her nickname. - Good to be home-</pre>
