<h1>Love Hina: Once Again (part 11 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/onceagain-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;So,&quot; Usagi Tsukino puffed tiredly as they walked up
the stone steps, &quot;how much farther is it to the dorm
now?&quot;

&quot;It shouldn&#39;t be too much farther,&quot; Makoto Kino said
with barely concealed amusement, her brown hair
flowing in a long ponytail. She wore a simple green
dress and carried their lunch, a large cooler with
snacks, drinks and a few treats, just in case.

&quot;If I knew it was going to be this bad,&quot; the blonde
haired Minako Aino noted, her blue eyes twinkling, &quot;I
would have suggested we meet Ami and Rei somewhere
else.&quot;

&quot;Somehow, I can&#39;t imagine Ami walking this every day,&quot;
Usagi noted, her twin ponytails glittering golden in
the sun.

&quot;I suppose you get used to it?&quot; Minako guessed.

&quot;Do you see the top of a building up there?&quot; Usagi
asked, shading her eyes from the sun.

Makoto nodded, her green eyes laughing a bit as she
said, &quot;Yes, I think we&#39;ve made it.&quot;

With a burst of energy all three women hurried up the
next secion of steps, reaching the top of the hill
where the Hinata Inn perched with a view of the town
below it. The old fashioned building was three stories
tall and well maintained, giving it a bright and
cheerful air, almost vibrant with the life within.

&quot;You know, I think I can see why Ami might have chosen
this place,&quot; Minako said as they stopped by the main
gate to take in the view, the beauty of the place and
a odd feeling of serenity around them...

BOOM!

&quot;What in the...&quot; Usagi nearly jumped as foot as they
heard the explosion coming from inside the building.

With instincts they had honed from fighting youma for
years Usagi, Minako and Makoto raced up to the Inn and
hurried inside, sweeping the place with their eyes as
they tried to find the source of the disturbance.

&quot;Su!&quot; they heard the distinctive voice of Rei Hino
yell, &quot;Turn that robot off and get the fire
extinguisher!&quot;

Minako, Usagi and Makoto exchanged looks. &quot;Should we
go up or...?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;Hello,&quot; a young woman looked at them timidly and all
three realized they&#39;d barged right in without
permission.

&quot;Ah, hi,&quot; Usagi smiled winningly art the girl as she
said, &quot;we&#39;re looking for Ami and Rei. Are they home?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll go get them,&quot; the black haired girl said,
seemingly charmed by Usagi&#39;s sweet manner as she
hurried off.

A few moments later a visibly singed looking Rei Hino
arrived, her simple clothes covered with soot and a
bit of smoke curling off of her. &quot;What in the...?&quot;
Makoto blinked.

&quot;Don&#39;t ask,&quot; Rei sighed.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Usagi quickly stepped forward, throwing her
arms around her friend and utterly unmindful of the
mess.

&quot;Damn it, you&#39;ll stain your dresses,&quot; Rei tried to
sound gruff as she was hugged by all three of them,
but she hugged them back fiercely.

&quot;Looking good,&quot; Minako teased as she used a finger to
wipe off some of the black ash from Rei&#39;s cheek.

&quot;Oh shut up,&quot; Rei shook her head. Leading them down
the hall she said, &quot;Ami and I have a corner suite,
just up this way.&quot;

Ami hurried up the hall, the blue haired girl much
less messy than Rei. &quot;Good to see you,&quot; she laughed as
she too was engulfed in hugs.

&quot;I see your guests have arrived,&quot; a calm woman&#39;s voice
mentioned. The black haired woman had a matching cat
perched on her shoulder, her clothes blending into the
shadows to almost make her seem ghost-like.

&quot;Kanako Urashima,&quot; Ami made the introductions, &quot;these
are our friends Usagi, Minako and Makoto.&quot;

&quot;Sisters?&quot; Kanako asked, nodding towards Minako and
Usagi.

&quot;Sorry, no,&quot; Rei fought back a smile, &quot;though they do
act like it at times.&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Usagi protested, stamping her foot.

Kanako hid a smile as she said, &quot;Well, I hope you have
a nice visit.&quot; With that she left, only pausing a
moment to give Makoto a lingering, questioning look.

&quot;What was that about?&quot; Minako asked as they entered
into the corner room Ami and Rei shared, a large
window looking out over the city below them.

&quot;I&#39;m not totally sure,&quot; Ami admitted as she pushed Rei
into the next room to clean up, &quot;but I think Makoto is
the type she likes.&quot;

&quot;Should I tell her I&#39;m married?&quot; Makoto asked, eyes
twinkling, &quot;because I&#39;m pretty sure Haruna would be
pretty upset if she tried something.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s not quite that bold,&quot; Ami chuckled. She smiled,
&quot;You made quite a impression on Shinobu, by the way.&quot;

&quot;The girl that met us?&quot; Usagi smiled, &quot;She seems
nice.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s actually a bit older than I,&quot; Ami sounded
amused as she explained, &quot;but she&#39;s small for her age,
I guess.&quot;

&quot;I thought she was still a high schooler,&quot; Minako
blinked, surprised.

&quot;Don&#39;t tell her that,&quot; Rei returned, looking much
neater than before, &quot;she get&#39;s mistaken enough for a
kid as it is.&quot;

Makoto grinned at her impishly as she asked, &quot;So, what
happened to you?&quot;

Rei groaned softly. &quot;Su is our local tech wizard,&quot; she
explained, &quot;she built a new robot with a flame
thrower.&quot;

&quot;Inside?&quot; Usagi squeaked.

&quot;Su doesn&#39;t always think little details like that
through,&quot; Ami explained.

&quot;I can imagine,&quot; Minako blinked. &quot;How old is she, by
the way?&quot;

&quot;Old enough to know better,&quot; Rei grumbled.

&quot;This from the woman who got in a drinking match with
Kitsune,&quot; Ami teased.

&quot;Really?&quot; Usagi looked surprised even as Rei blushed.
&quot;Oooh, I wanna hear about this,&quot; she said eagerly.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Rei whimpered.

&quot;We were over at the caf&eacute; next door, in which Miss
Kitsune runs,&quot; Ami impishly explained, &quot;and drinking
and Rei&#39;s grandfather came up. Then, Rei&#39;s occassional
drinking with him was mentioned and...&quot;

&quot;Things kind of went from there?&quot; Minako guessed.

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Rei sighed. She winced, &quot;I swear, I have
never had such a headache as I had the morning after
that.&quot;

After a bit of light conversation Usagi looked at both
girls searchingly a moment. &quot;So you&#39;re happy here, so
far?&quot; she asked the two of them.

Ami took Rei&#39;s hand, squeezing it gently, &quot;I think
so.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Rei agreed.</pre>
