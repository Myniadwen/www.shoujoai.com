<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Together<br /></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>These late nights are killing me.’</em> Rei groused even as the mid day winter sun kept her warm while she  swept the courtyard. She’d been four hours behind in her duties, thanks  to her late night and subsequent late morning with Minako.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It sounded scandalous though it really wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Not yet, anyway.’</em> She considered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Whatever  she and Minako had kicked off the night before was nothing official or  binding, and Minako was smarter than to try to put terms around what  seemed like a relationship they were starting. Still, Rei couldn’t help  but admit that it was something she thought she wanted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The moody miko blushed at her thoughts and poured her excited energy into sweeping the courtyard.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  wasn’t aware of the slightest of grins that tugged at her lips, and if  she knew that the smile she’d worn all day had been the talk of the  shrine, she’d surely have died of embarrassment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But that was  when Rei sensed the object of her thoughts before she even saw her. A  shiver ran down the miko’s spine, the hair on her arms stood on end,  and that familiar strong aura that was so distinctly <em>Minako</em> tingled at the edge of her senses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  there she was; heralded by the click-clack of high-heeled boots, Minako  strutted across the courtyard, heading towards her. Wearing an outfit  that called attention to itself, in only the way an incognito outfit  could, it left Rei to wonder how the singer didn’t attract <em>more</em> attention to herself, considering the ridiculously large sunglasses,  stupidly huge hat, frustratingly concealing heavy jacket, and yet a  teasingly short skirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And just what was she doing here anyway?  They were supposed to meet at Crown later that afternoon. And why was  she heading from the direction of the shrine’s gift shop instead of  from the steps? What was that in her hand?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>And </em>why<em> is she totally ignoring me?’ </em>Rei growled to herself as the idol strutted right past her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>The hardest part is ignoring her,’ </em>Minako thought as she marched past the gawking miko,<em> ‘but this’ll be worth it.’ </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having  confessed her feelings, having poured her heart out the night before,  and having gotten an even better reaction out of her best friend than  she’d hoped for, Minako had decided to forego the subtle approach.  After five long years of pining for Rei, she felt she was entitled to  allow herself to lightly tease the somewhat skittish miko. But… at  least she planned to do so thoughtfully.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Feeling Rei’s  inquisitive eyes burning a hole in her back, the singer knelt before  the stone chozuya basin in the middle of the courtyard. Dipping the  bamboo ladle into the water, Minako poured a small amount of the cold  water into her free palm and then studiously washed both hands with the  purifying liquid. Next, in an effort to call the attention of the  shrine’s Kami to her intentions, she clapped her hands twice, folded  her hands closed at chest height, and then closed her eyes before  dipping her head low.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The intensity of Rei’s stare dimmed,  replaced with quiet wonder as the miko watched the singer’s formal  request for a prayer to be answered. It seemed almost silly, to see  this Catholic girl perform a Shinto ritual, but it really touched Rei  that, perhaps as a result of their conversation the night before, her  best friend seemed to be making an effort to honor her roots.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that was when she realized, with no small amount of surprise, what the object Minako carried was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer approached the shrine’s ema stand; a wooden rack filled with  rows of hanging wooden votives, similar plaques all emblazoned with a  rearing horse on one side, and a handwritten wish on the other. Tucking  an errant lock of caramel highlighted hair behind an ear, Minako held  her ema by its string and considered its placement on the board with  the utmost care. Finally, she nodded, hung her votive, bowed once more,  and with an air of finality, stepped back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly, the singer  turned and finally allowed herself to look at Rei. She smiled broadly,  as though she’d never ignored her in the first place, as though she’d  just arrived. “I know I’m a little early, but thought I’d pick you up.  You know, we could head to Crown together?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko frowned and  glanced at a delicate watch that clung to her wrist. She hadn’t  realized how late it’d gotten, and she was already running behind.  She’d have to forego the shower she’d planned. “I’ll have to change at  least.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s smile slipped into a suggestive smirk, and with  an exaggerated sway of her hips, she closed the distance between  herself and Rei, “Oh? I could help you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Eh!?” Rei choked, her  mind swimming between memories of what their past personas had shared,  and certain dreams she’d been having…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer smacked her lips and crossed her arms over her chest. “I was <em>going</em> to say I could help you choose an outfit. I don’t know where <em>your</em> mind is,” she leaned forward and pinched Rei’s cheek, “<em>hentai</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko’s face flushed bright red - the accusation was worse than her  original assumption - and she sputtered for words, looking entirely  offended but completely unable to form a comeback.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako winked  and retreated a few steps. Over her shoulder, she called between  laughs, “Meet me down at my car when you’re ready. I’ll be waiting for  you. ”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei fumed until Minako was out of sight, her bouncing form  disappearing to the crest of the hill. She’d gotten her good, but Rei  vowed to return the favor. She clutched her broom and began heading  back towards the living quarters when she paused and looked back over  her shoulder to the rows of ema behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly, Rei  approached the board, examining the rows of wooden votives hanging  amidst each other, each wish hoping to be answered by the shrine’s  resident Kami. The plaques clicked against each other as her fingers  glanced across wishes for high scoring test grades, wishes for  fertility, and even a wish for a new pet turtle, until she found the  votive she was looking for.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei picked up the plaque Minako had hung. The ink was still wet in the cold air. <em>‘What would she who already has everything wish for?’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  small grin Rei had worn all day turned into a full fledged smile. Her  voice was a whisper as she read Minako’s negai-goto, or wish words;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Happy future… together.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Three  heads turned when the door to their secret meeting room opened to  produce not just one of their two late friends, but both at the same  time. Completely entranced with one other, Rei and Minako could have  been in their own world; standing practically on top of each other, it  was a wonder they didn’t tumble down the steps in a tangle of limbs.  Three blank expressions slipped into furrowed brows and open mouths as  Aino Minako, clinging tightly to Hino Rei’s elbow, slung a snarky  comeback to a previously unheard barb,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well if you weren’t such a <em>hentai</em>, maybe we would have gotten here sooner.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bristling, Rei snapped her head back to glare up at Minako. “Would you <em>stop</em> taking that out of context? I told you, you got that all wrong!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi  set her soda down with a clatter, Makoto stuck the end of her pen in  her mouth in wonder, and the slightest of blushes warmed Ami’s cheeks.  The three women examined their other two friends as though they were  complete strangers.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It would be the beginning of an interesting night.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Beneath a loud and colorful homemade banner announcing, <em>‘Congratulations on the success of your super awesome Encore Finale Concert!!!!!!’</em> (Makoto and Ami had suggested a shorter phrase and fewer exclamation  points, but Usagi had insisted), Minako distractedly toyed with a  bouquet of yellow roses her friends had presented her with. Smiling  lazily, she observed the animated discussion those same three women  were engaged in, as they decided each others fates in the next round of  karaoke.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that left Rei, who, for all her attempts at disinterest in karaoke, <em>was</em> looking rather intently at Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Ha! Gotcha.’</em> The singer thought to herself as she caught Rei’s gaze, resulting in a  quickly turned head and a rising blush at having been caught staring.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  lazy smile slipped into a mischievous smirk as she examined the  brooding miko, and slowly, she reached her foot under the table. When  her toes slid along a muscular calf, she could only hope she’d gotten  Rei and not Ami, but when her best friend’s gaze shot up in panicked  surprise, she knew she’d hit her target.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer feigned  innocence, even as under the table, she slowly dragged her toes up past  Rei’s knee. Her eyes were locked on the miko, though her comment was  directed to the others, “Rei wants to sing this round.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I do not!” Rei barked, perhaps a little too vehemently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi pouted and rested her chin in her palms, “But Rei-chan, you have such a nice voice!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  wandering toes slid along Rei’s slender thigh. It took all the miko had  to reign herself in, though from what; be it scooting her chair back  abruptly, breaking Minako’s toes, or leaping across the table and  kissing the hell out of the damnable woman, she wasn’t sure. Her teeth  ground together in frustration, “I’m <em>not</em> singing.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Having  tuned herself out to what seemed like another quarrel between the  singer and the miko, Makoto looked up from the song selections  animatedly. “Ooh, Ami, why don’t you sing your rendition of Lonely  Heart?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi latched onto this idea, and as she and Makoto  pushed an only semi reluctant Ami onto the stage, Minako retracted her  teasing foot and turned to Rei with a merciless smirk, “You’re so  easily flustered, <em>Reiko</em>.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned and Minako winced,  realizing her mistake too late. It was the same slip up that had caused  Rei to retreat once already. She may have reconciled herself with her  past life, but the miko felt strongly that her past persona had no  influence on her present, and as such, didn’t like to be compared  against it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">No sooner did a hushed, “I’m sorry,” escape Minako  lips, than Rei was shaking her head. “It’s okay,” she said demurely,  both of their quiet voices unheard by the others who were clapping as  the musical score of a popular ballad poured through the room’s  speakers and Ami launched into song.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko could feel the  singer’s soft and questioning gaze, but as Rei feigned interest in  Ami’s performance, she chose to ignore it. If Minako could honor Rei’s  Shinto background, then Rei could respect the fact that their past  lives were equally important to her best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, a small  but thoughtful smile touched Rei’s lips, and this time, it was her toes  that nudged her best friend’s calf. She leaned across the table, and  drawing herself closer to Minako, she whispered, “I never had a pet  name for you back then, did I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer shook her head, but  then lit up with a sudden idea, “Make one up now!” She raised an  eyebrow suggestively, “you could always go back to calling me your <em>Princess</em>. I rather enjoyed that one.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  furious blush colored Rei’s face and she backpedaled, pushing herself  back into her chair. “Leave it to you to twist a misunderstanding!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko didn’t realize how loud her voice had been in the suddenly quiet  room as Ami’s song had ended, and as Minako met the barb with one of  her own, the two seemed entirely oblivious to their other three friends.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Setting  the microphone down before stepping off the stage, Ami glanced at  Makoto knowingly. The gesture didn’t get past Usagi, and she rushed  over to her two friends, eager for their gossip. She looked to Ami for  answers, and the small woman simply nodded to their tall friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s  just like at your wedding, when you threw the bouquet,” Makoto hazarded  quietly to the real Princess in the room, “you know, that spark of  rivalry that hides too much…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Usagi stilled for a moment. Trying  to decipher Makoto’s cryptic words, she stared at the arguing Rei and  Minako blankly. She saw her two fiery and easily provoked friends and  former senshi doing what they did best; being in a well tried and  tested argument. Even still, just like the picture before her, Usagi  remembered that at the height of their rivalry five years ago, even  when they were at odds with each other, those two were always right  next to each other.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Inseparable.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the more she watched  the minute body language they displayed and the distant, far off,  longing looks the two women would cast in each others direction, the  more she listened to what could have been double meanings laced into  the barbed comments…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh my god!” Usagi choked, and as the  argument between Rei and Minako suddenly ground to a halt and the two  women turned to see a very sheepish Ami and Makoto, each with a hand  clasped over Usagi’s mouth, the goofy woman who had once saved the  world backpedaled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Nefermind.” She managed between her friends’ restraining hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  sun had long set. The moon was getting ready to call it an early night.  And after the five friends had called it quits an hour before midnight,  Rei and Minako found themselves wandering the downtown Juuban strip  after the singer had insisted she walk the miko back to her shrine.  Maybe they were taking the scenic route. Maybe they were just stalling.  But neither woman seemed to be in a rush to part.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite the  late hour on a Thursday night, there was plenty of commotion on the  city streets; businessmen scrambled to the subways after a night of  drinking with coworkers, college students gathered around coffee shops  and convenience stores, but despite the slight competition for space on  the sidewalk and the noise in the air, the two women found the  atmosphere comfortable enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do you think… they suspect  anything?” Rei asked haltingly, finding the sidewalk interesting. The  ‘they’ she referred to remained unspoken, but her reference was obvious  after their night at the Crown.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What is there to suspect?” Minako asked coyly with a hopeful wag of her eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hmm,” the miko shrugged and fought back a grin, “let them wonder.” She concluded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pleased  with her best friend’s response, the singer smiled that trademark smirk  of hers that seemed to say all at once; screw off, but come hither. The  expression was a contradiction, not at all unlike Minako herself, and  it sparked a fire deep within Rei that she had never before allowed to  ignite. It scared her. It excited her. It left her breathless.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  also left her distracted, for she hadn’t realized that Minako had  stopped walking. Rei frowned and took the few steps back to Minako’s  side, looking at her in askance. When the idol pointed to the left, the  miko’s questioning frown only deepened. The convenience store? The  department store? The couple making out between the two?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako sighed. “The photo booth, dummy.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Only  after punching her best friend’s shoulder lightly for the insult did  realization dawn on the raven haired woman. Minako pulled a well worn  photo strip from her purse. Showing a gradual progression between the  two women from hesitant, to comfortable, and finally, to friendly with  each other, it was a strip to which Rei held its twin. The miko smiled  knowingly, the singer nodded, and together, they dashed to the photo  booth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Amid a couple of stares, for the sight of two full grown  women clambering into one small photo booth was odd enough, Rei and  Minako pushed, shoved, elbowed, and giggled their way onto the narrow  seat and slid the curtain shut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Great minds think alike, and it  was by unspoken agreement that their first picture mirror the last  photo they had taken only about a year prior. Flashing the victory sign  with one hand, Minako had her other arm around Rei’s shoulder, her head  tipped into Rei’s. Rei did her part as her best friend’s mirror image,  and the smile on her face had never felt larger or more honest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">After  the flash of the first photo nearly blinded her, the miko turned her  head to look to the singer for guidance in their next pose. She was met  with Minako’s mischievous grin, and when she felt Minako’s soft fingers  dance along her jaw line, the raven haired woman’s dark eyes widened in  surprise.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The bright light threatened to blind Rei once again,  but she wasn’t so blind as to catch the subtle tilt of her best  friend’s head, and though she hadn’t realized she was holding her  breath, she was conscious of canting her own in response and leaning  in, ever so slightly, so that she felt the singer’s warm breath on her  lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei didn’t see the next bright flash, for when the last  photo was shot, her eyes were shut, and her lips were pressed against  Minako’s in a gentle, yet firm kiss.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The neon glow of  the city streets ebbed away slightly as they left the shopping district  behind and walked through neighborhood streets. A light blush dusted  Rei’s cheeks where she trailed tiredly alongside Minako. Midnight had  passed and though she’d had her fill of late nights, she heavily  debated the consequences of yet another.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, were you really  serious about being interested in the work I’m doing for my charity  division?” The question was a valid one, but Minako used the inquiry as  an opportunity to tug at Rei’s jacket sleeve.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei shook herself from her thoughts. “Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Thinking about our photo strip kiss, <em>hentai</em>?” Minako asked scandalously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko rolled her eyes. “I don’t assume you’ll <em>ever</em> let me live that down?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako chuckled evilly, “No, I don’t assume I will.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  her best friend smacked her lips, she found the excuse she was looking  for to slide her hand down from the other woman’s sleeve to twine her  fingers with Rei’s. “As I was saying, if you were really serious about  the work I’m doing with my charity division, you should stop by my  office tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei pointed to herself with her free hand, a  questioning expression on her face. “Yes, you,” Minako replied testily,  “I have a radio interview at ten, to talk to the media about my next  album. Maybe we can meet after that? We could bounce some ideas off  each other, you know, join forces on it. You’ve been doing community  works for a long time. I could really use your input.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko  visibly puffed up with importance. “I think I can make it,” she said  casually, even as her thumb caressed the top of Minako’s hand.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Winding  through a dimly lit park, they took a detour, bypassing the residential  streets. To the right rose the hill that the Hikawa Shrine sat atop of.  They were nearing their destination and both women slowed their pace  subconsciously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Somewhere between the swings and the monkey bars, Rei chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What’cha thinking about?” Minako prodded gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko looked up to where the slightest sliver of a crescent moon broke  through the cold and cloudy sky. “I can’t believe our first kiss was in  a photo booth.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“How about this,” Minako suggested, “our second kiss was in the park by your shrine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Rei turned her head back towards her best friend, she found Minako  already waiting for her, and for the second time that night, their lips  met.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But with the moon as their witness, this kiss wasn’t all  innocence and gentle askance. Their hands still laced together, Rei  raised her free hand to brush past Minako’s cheekbone and threaded her  fingers through the idol’s caramel highlighted hair. And it was the  miko who deepened their kiss, her hungry tongue playing along the  singer’s bottom lip, requesting access, which was readily granted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">When  Minako’s free hand grabbed at Rei’s jacket, just above her breast, she  pulled the slightly taller woman even closer to her, eagerly learning  her best friend’s mouth, her tongue struggling for dominance even as  she felt the edge of Rei’s thumb tease the corner of her mouth gently.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  when the two women were forced to part for air, they breathed each  other’s breaths, personal space all but forgotten between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  it was late, and if Minako didn’t leave Rei hanging, her game of cat  and mouse would have been for nothing. Winking boldly, the singer  grinned and spun from Rei’s grip, her fingers holding on to the miko’s  until the last possible second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“See you in the morning!” She called over her shoulder as she aimed her shaky legs in the direction of her apartment building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stunned  at Minako, stunned at herself, the miko’s fingers touched her lips as  she watched her best friend’s retreating form. Throwing her fears, her  worries, her expectations out the window, Rei smiled broadly, and  turned and headed for the shrine.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  little fluffy filler, yes. But it was fun, ne? I mean come on, I’ve got  to allow them a little happiness before I complicate their lives again!  What did ya think?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Despite the fact that they’d come to terms  with their feelings in the previous chapter, they still hadn’t shared  their first kiss yet. It seemed more fitting on Rei’s part to hold off  just a little longer. But now, hehe, she’s grown much more comfortable  with the idea. And the ‘Call me Princess’ bit is such an alluring  thought to me. I mean, how long did Rei/Mars run around calling  Minako/Venus Princess? Perhaps Minako grew accustomed to it? Anyway,  I’m guilty of using it in my next fic that I’m working on, too. I’m bad.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And now, what you’ve all been waiting for:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview(s), Chapter 10:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anxious eyes scanned the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was nothing out of the ordinary. A calculated sweep of those gathered  told Rei there were about a hundred in attendance, to include the  media. For the most part, the fans were well behaved, if overly  excited; some touting large signs, others wearing tour t-shirts, and  many carrying those damnable plush unicorn mascots, Nako-Nako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So why was she so on edge?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Something… something’s wrong here.’</em> She couldn’t smell it, she couldn’t see it, but she could sense it. And  while she didn’t feel an overwhelming sense of danger, Rei knew her  presence would be needed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And here is a second preview, because you guys are so awesome and that was short:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked at her watch and frowned, “It’s almost midnight. What is it with you and staying up so late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  let the moment slip away. Leaning back in her swiveling chair, she  pointed to the other woman accusatorily. “Afraid you’ll turn into a  pumpkin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keh. I’m not tired,” Rei was quick to defend herself as her pen jotted a few more notes, “I’m just getting started.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  if that’s the case, I have some more documentation we can look at back  at my apartment…” Minako offered brightly, a not so innocent smirk  gracing her delicate features.</span></p>
