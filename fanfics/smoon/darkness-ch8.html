<h1>Darkness (part 8 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>After Amara and Michelle went to their room the girls bedroom door was 
reopened. Who ever it was, walked into the dark room and walked over 
to Serena&#39;s bed.

A hand went down and shook the sleeping girl awake. Serena tiredly 
opened up her eye&#39;s which soon widened in shock.

&quot;Jet, Tray?!?!&quot; exclaimed Serena. The twin boys smiled warmly at their 
sister to whom they haven&#39;t seen for four years.

Serena jumped towards her brothers and brought them down into a hug. 
The two boys hugged her back as well as Serena felt tears running down 
her face.

Serena sniffled a couple of times before she sat back to look over her 
brothers features. Their features had matured greatly and she 
continued to look them over.

Jet&#39;s hair was still black and spiky, but he had high lighted the tips 
of the spikes silver. He had a gold loop earring in his left ear and a 
matching lip ring. He wore a silver chain with a large cross hanging 
on it. It was embedded with diamonds and had a jaguar wrapping around 
it.

He wore a black sweat shirt with a hood and a pouch in front. He wore 
a dark gray t-shirt underneath and tan colored cargo pants with black 
Timberlins.

Tray still had his golden blonde hair. He had also spiked it up and 
put high lights of silver in it. Tray had a diamond stud earring on 
his left ear with a silver loop earring in both of his top left 
portion of his ears.

He also had the same necklace as Jet except his chain was gold and he 
had a lion wrapped around his cross. He wore a black t-shirt with 
baggy black jeans. He had his dark green boxers slightly showing, with 
a black belt for his jeans. He also wore a pair of black Iversons for 
sneakers.

Serena stared at them a second more before she smiled up at them. They 
looked down at her and took in her appearance as well.

&quot;I&#39;ve missed you guys so much.&quot;, whispered Serena careful as not to 
wake up Rei and Hotaru.

&quot;We&#39;ve missed you to.&quot;, replied Tray with a smile.

&quot;So, what are you guys doing here.&quot;, questioned Serena.

&quot;Well, Artemis said we can come back to see how you&#146;re doing.&quot;, said 
Jet.

&quot;And we heard that you were going on your first hunt today.&quot;, replied 
Tray. Serena nodded her head and put up a smile.

&quot;So how did your hunt go?&quot;, asked Tray.

&quot;I did really good and I got two people instead of one&quot;, exclaimed 
Serena quietly.

&quot;That&#39;s great.&quot;, congratulated Jet with a hug.

&quot;Guess what?&#39;, said Jet. Serena looked up a Jet curiously.

&quot;We got you a present.&quot;, said Tray. Jet took out a velvet box from the 
front of his pouch. Serena&#39;s eyes widened as Jet handed her the box.

&quot;Go on. Open it.&quot;, encouraged Tray.

Serena held the box in her hands as she traced the edges lightly. She 
finally decided to opened the box. Her eyes widened slightly as tears 
brimmed her eyes.

It was a necklace with a thin gold chain. It had a cross with her name 
embedded in it with red rubies. Surrounding the rubies were diamonds 
and their was a panther wrapped around the cross.

Serena stared at the necklace in awe. Jet pulled the necklace out of 
the case and put it around Serena&#39;s neck. Serena put her hand on the 
necklace and let her tears fall. Tray leaned over and wiped away the 
tears.

&quot;I guess you like it.&quot;, said Tray. Serena enveloped her brothers into 
a tight hug yet again. They stayed like that for awhile until Jet and 
Tray leaned back.

&quot;We got to go.&quot;, said Jet. Serena&#39;s eyes widened and her voice began 
to crack.

&quot;Leaving! You can&#39;t leave me again. I won&#39;t let you&quot;, sobbed Serena. 
Jet and Tray sighed to themselves.

&quot;We have to. We got to train some more.&quot;, said Jet.

&quot;Yeah! We promise that we&#39;ll be back. Ok?&quot;, said Tray. Serena nodded 
her head as she looked at her hands. Jet leaned down and tilted 
Serena&#39;s head up with his hand.

&quot;We promise that we&#39;ll be back. Nothing will keep us from braking that 
promise.&quot;, said Jet.

&quot;Okay.&quot; replied Serena sadly. Jet and Tray gave her one more hug 
before they left to leave again.

Serena held her necklace and leaned back into the pillow. She began to 
cry quietly and she started to rock from side to side.

Rei was awaked for some of the conversation and became worried when 
Serena began to cry brokenly. Rei sat up and walked over to Serena&#39;s 
bed. She sat down and put a hand on Serena&#39;s side.

Serena stopped rocking and looked up a Rei with teary eyes. Rei bent 
down and brushed away the tears. Serena smiled up at her wearily as 
Rei continued to stare at her.

&quot;You okay?&quot;, asked Rei.

&quot;I&#39;m fine&quot;, said Serena. Rei rolled her eyes knowing that her best 
friend was lying.

&quot;No your not.&quot;, argued Rei.

&quot;Yes I am.&quot;,replied Serena while turning her back to Rei. Rei rolled 
her back over and retorted:

&quot;No your not. I could see that lie from a mile away. Please tell me 
what&#146;s wrong.&quot;

Serena sighed before she spoke. &quot; My brothers were here. They gave me 
this necklace. And they had to leave me again.&quot;

Serena broke down with her body racking with sobs. Rei grabbed Serena 
and pulled the girl up into her arms. Serena openly cried into the 
girl&#39;s chest and took in the comfort from her friend.

Rei rocked the girl back and forth which lured her to sleep. Rei tried 
to unravel Serena&#39;s arms from he waist, but the girl kept up a tight 
grip around her. Rei knew it was useless to even try and laid her and 
Serena down on the bed.

Rei cradled Serena&#39;s head to the crook of her neck and got themselves 
comfortable. Rei sighed and closed her eyes. She kind of felt at peace 
having Serna in her arms, but the thought went as soon as came. Rei 
let one more sigh escape her mouth before she went to sleep.</pre>
