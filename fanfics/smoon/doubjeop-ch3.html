Rei&#39;s voice replied to Minako over the phone, &quot;It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t 
think it&#39;s a good idea, Minako. It&#39;s just that Ami has been acting 
strange for nearly three days now. She&#39;s been getting our names mixed 
up, she gets lost in a town she&#39;s lived in her entire life, she called 
into work sick, and now you tell me she went out from early yesterday 
evening to early this morning, and won&#39;t tell you where she went. I just 
don&#39;t think Ami is in her right mind at the moment, which makes it kinda 
wrong to try to set her up right now.&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;Look, Rei, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m trying to trick them to 
sleep together. All I want is to have you come over here and we will 
have Ami go over to Makoto&#39;s for the night to kinda get a break from 
each other and mix things up a bit. It&#39;s not like this is their first 
time alone together either. Just the first time since we have known how 
they feel. Besides, Ami really is getting on my nerves since she came 
back from the hospital. I&#39;m really OK with her being someone else&#39;s 
problem for one night.&quot;

Then Minako said, sounding more urgent, &quot;Plus, on top of that, she has 
that date on Saturday night! We have to move quickly to get the box 
rolling by then, or she won&#39;t wind up with Makoto! Desperate times call 
for urgent sprints!&quot;

Now, it was Rei&#39;s turn to sigh, and the blonde also got the feeling that 
the miko also rolled her eyes. &quot;Fine Minako-chan, you win. I&#39;ll have 
Makoto drop me off for the evening in a little bit. Just keep our 
wandering, blue haired friend from running off until I get there. I 
think Makoto would like having Ami around instead of me for a while, 
anyway.&quot;

Then, more quietly, so as to make sure if Makoto was listening in on the 
conversation outside the room she couldn&#39;t hear, Rei added, &quot;I think 
Makoto knows at least one of us was snooping on her computer and I don&#39;t 
want to be here if she decides to beat it out of me who that was. See 
you in a bit, Minako-Chan!&quot; With that, Rei hung up the phone.

As soon as Minako hung up the phone, she heard a knock on her door. 
&quot;Come in&quot;.

Ami walked in and said, &quot;Minako, I have an idea. I know you must be sick 
of me by now. How about I let Rei borrow my room for the night and I 
trade places with her and stay with Makoto. It will be kind of a break 
while I sort things out, plus give us both some time to get away from 
each other.&quot;

&quot;You weren&#39;t listening in to my conversation with Rei, were you, Ami?&quot; 
That was something else Minako had noticed Ami had been doing. Ami had 
started picking up phones in other parts of the apartment to try to 
listen in to Minako&#39;s conversations with other people. Even one to the 
local pizza delivery restaurant for lunch. This was exactly the reason 
that had caused her to want to kick Ami out for a while.

Ami looked at Minako innocently, and said, &quot;No, but I did catch part of 
it through the door. You&#39;re kinda loud.&quot;

Minako was sure Ami hadn&#39;t heard all of the conversation because there 
would have definitely been more questions, so she wasn&#39;t too worried. 
Instead, she said, sounding relieved, &quot;Yeah, Ami-chan! I think that 
would be a great idea. As a matter of fact, if you go and look in your 
closet, there is a nice suitcase packed with three days&#39; worth of stuff 
for you. Makoto should be by with Rei in a moment, so we are all set and 
everyone is happy.&quot; As Ami left to get her things, Minako was glad she 
had planned on locking Ami out in advance even if this wasn&#39;t completely 
how she wanted to go about it.

A short time later, Rei entered Minako&#39;s room. Minako looked up from her 
seat at her desk and said, &quot;Please tell me she&#39;s gone.&quot;

Rei looked at Minako and said, smiling, &quot;Yep. Operation Thunder Snow is 
underway! Now are you ready to go raid Ami&#39;s computer?&quot;

Minako looked at Rei and smiled. &quot;I already did last night while she was 
out, and you won&#39;t believe some of the stuff she&#39;s got on there!&quot;

----------

Makoto didn&#39;t know anyone had cracked into her computer. The reason she 
was so frustrated around Rei hadn&#39;t been that at all. The Senshi of 
electricity hadn&#39;t heard from her online girlfriend since Friday 
evening, and it was now Monday evening. Nearly three days. It wasn&#39;t 
like PB to drop off the face of the earth like that without a word. On 
top of that, there was the way she had been hearing about Ami&#39;s behavior 
since her incident. Her friends were starting to wonder if the Senshi of 
ice hadn&#39;t sustained some form of brain damage.

She watched as the short, blue-haired woman wandered around her 
apartment. Ami looked at Makoto and said, sounding truly sincere, &quot;This 
place is really nice, Makoto. I can&#39;t wait to see when you&#39;re done 
decorating. It&#39;ll be beautiful.&quot;

Makoto smiled to hide the fact that she was becoming extremely worried 
about Ami. The others had said she was acting strange lately, but Ami 
really should already have known how her apartment looked since she was 
the person who had gone with Makoto when she went apartment shopping, 
and who had helped her move in. Not wanting to embarrass Ami, Makoto 
said simply, &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Makoto then said, &quot;Ami, I know you just got here, but I need to go out 
to the store for a few and pick up some ingredients to make us some 
dinner. It&#39;s been a while since you had a good, decent, cooked meal. 
Just stay here and I&#39;ll be right back. Feel free to have a look around 
if you like. The supermarket across the street tends to have everything 
I usually need, so you shouldn&#39;t have to wait long.&quot;

After apologizing again, Makoto left Ami alone in the apartment.

Once the door closed, Ami said angrily, as she whipped out her 
communicator, &quot;About damn time they left me alone for 10 minutes.&quot; She 
ran a hand through her hair gently for a moment in thought, then winced 
in pain when her fingers came in contact with the large bruise on her 
head. She had felt it was necessary to make it look like she had been 
attacked, so she had had her lover knock her over the head. She knew it 
would hurt, but she didn&#39;t expect the woman to hit her so hard it would 
give her a concussion. She would either have to be more specific next 
time, or avoid using such a strategy with her again.

&quot;Serena, this is Amy reporting in.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s face appeared on the communicator screen. Only it wasn&#39;t Usagi. 
Serena said simply, &quot;Report your progress.&quot;

&#39;Ami&#39; replied to the image quietly, &quot;I&#39;m currently in Makoto&#39;s 
apartment. I&#39;m going to gather information about her tonight, then I&#39;ll 
meet up with all of you outside of her apartment to give a full report 
and to finish my interrogation of Ami. Then we should have adequate 
information to kill all of the Sekkou of this dimension. So far, our 
plan is going perfectly.&quot;

&quot;Good work, Amy. I look forward to seeing you soon.&quot; Then, losing some 
of her formal tone, Serena said, &quot;Please be careful.&quot;

With that, Amy nodded, closed down her communicator, and went about her 
search of the apartment.

Makoto opened the door to her apartment about an hour after that. 
&quot;Ami-Chan, I&#39;m back! Sorry it took so long!&quot; said Makoto. When she 
realized Ami wasn&#39;t going to answer, Makoto went to the kitchen to put 
up her groceries. Once she opened the kitchen door, she found out why 
Ami hadn&#39;t answered.

&#39;Ami&#39; was at the table stacking empty beer cans into a pyramid. Makoto 
kept a case of beer for when she and Haruka got together to watch 
sporting events on TV. While she did drink a few now and then, she had 
never gotten drunk. And she never imagined any of her other friends 
would be interested in the stuff any, especially not enough to get 
drunk. Especially not Ami.

Amy placed the last one on top, then looked at Makoto. When she finally 
spoke, her speech was slurred a bit. &quot;Oh! Lit . . . Makoto-chan! Hi! I 
got a little thirsty, so I decided to try some of your . . .&quot; Amy picked 
up the top can to look at it again to try to remember what she was going 
to say &quot; . . . some of this stuff. We don&#39;t drink alcohol where I come 
from, so I had to try it out of curiosity, you see . . .&quot; Then Amy stood 
up and started staggering toward Makoto, saying, &quot;I must say it has an 
interesting effect on me.&quot;

Makoto walked over to Amy and held her so she wouldn&#39;t fall. Still 
unaware of the impostor, Makoto said, sounding almost as if she still 
didn&#39;t believe it, &quot;Ami . . . ? Are you . . . uh . . . drunk?&quot;

The usually intelligent woman looked at the beer cans arranged on the 
table for a moment with a rather stupid looking gaze, trying to choose 
her words. Then she leaned back in Makoto&#39;s arms and said, &quot;Yep,&quot; 
emphasizing the P in yep with an exaggerated popping sound. &quot;Never been 
drunk before . . . &quot; Amy wrapped some of Makoto&#39;s hair around one of her 
fingers then looked up as sweetly into the taller woman&#39;s green eyes as 
being drunk would allow and said, &quot;It&#39;s . . . interesting . . . I . . . 
feel less . . . inhibited? Is that even a word?&quot; Then Amy leaned up, 
pulling Makoto&#39;s head down a bit, pressing their foreheads together. 
&quot;Kiss me, Makoto.&quot; When Makoto didn&#39;t, she smiled and said with a 
surprisingly seductive tone to her voice, &quot;Come on, Mako. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot;

Makoto pushed Amy back, startled by her sexual advancement. Makoto had 
fantasized about Ami throwing herself at her before, but having her do 
it while she was recovering from a concussion and stark raving drunk 
with the strong smell of alcohol on her breath was disgusting as well as 
wrong to her. She would never take advantage of Ami in such a state. If 
she ever wanted her, Makoto much preferred the thought of Ami taking her 
with all her faculties working properly. Doing so right now was just 
wrong in Makoto&#39;s book.

Amy staggered backward, but amazingly kept her balance. Looking a little 
hurt, she said, &quot;Don&#39;t be like that Makoto . . . I know you want me.&quot; 
Before Amy could throw herself at Makoto again, her communicator started 
beeping. The far past tipsy woman pulled out her communicator and said, 
rather out of character and a little angry, &quot;Wadda ya want? Can&#39;t this 
wait? I&#39;m in the middle of . . . somethin&#39;.&quot;

Makoto heard Usagi&#39;s voice over the communicator say, &quot;You&#39;re supposed 
to meet us out here, remember? What&#39;s with you tonight?&quot;

Amy responded to whom Makoto thought was Usagi, saying, &quot;Be there in a 
sec,&quot; then closed her communicator and looked at Makoto sadly. &quot;Looks 
like I got to go . . . see ya around, Makoto.&quot; Amy staggered out the 
door without so much as an apology or a look back at Makoto.

Makoto quietly took a seat at the kitchen table, trying to clear her 
head. Her friends had told her that Ami was acting strange lately, but 
she doubted any of them would have thought she would have drunk . . . 
nine beers and not realized she would have gotten drunk doing it. 
Something was definitely amiss about the short, blue-haired woman and it 
was time to find out. After taking a few more moments to gain her 
senses, Makoto walked out of the apartment to find Ami.

Once Amy arrived, the group that had assembled to meet up with her 
looked at her with a mixture of astonishment and disgust. Amy stumbled 
toward them, and as soon as she could, she wrapped her arms around the 
woman who looked exactly like Makoto and asked, &quot;Would it count as 
cheating if I kissed someone who was your identical twin from a parallel 
dimension?&quot;

Lita looked at Amy and said, sounding revolted, &quot;You want my personal 
opinion?&quot;

Amy responded by taking a step back, bending over, putting her hands on 
her knees, and throwing up all over the sidewalk, barely missing Lita&#39;s 
feet.

The four looked at Amy for a moment. She had started to hiccup as she 
finally lost her balance, landing on the ground with a thud. Then Ray 
broke the silence. &quot;We need to get back.&quot;

Makoto watched from her hiding place near the door of the apartment 
building, as the group helped the drunk woman to her feet and 
practically dragged her off. She had originally come down to walk Ami 
home or insist she come back upstairs, but when she saw Ami talking to 
someone who looked amazingly like herself, she realized something was 
seriously wrong.

Makoto flipped on her communicator, set it to contact all the senshi, 
and spoke when someone&#39;s face appeared on the screen. Noticing none of 
the people in front of her had turned on their communicators made Makoto 
even more suspicious. She was in such a hurry, she almost didn&#39;t notice 
that Minako was the one on the screen. &quot;Listen, I think Ami is in very 
real danger. I&#39;m following a group of people right now. I&#39;ll contact all 
of you as soon as I find out where they are heading. Meet me there.&quot; 
Before anyone could reply, Makoto clicked off her communicator and 
started following the five people, keeping her distance so as not to be 
noticed.

----------

It had been a long walk to her target&#39;s destination, which it turned out 
was an old abandoned automobile factory. The place hadn&#39;t put out a 
single product since the mid 1980s. It was almost completely enclosed, 
with no windows save a small area for offices on the front of the 
building. A perfect place to hide away from the world. There had been a 
few times on the way that Makoto thought she was seen by the group of 
women she was following, but since they made no attempts to lose or 
attack her, Makoto assumed they hadn&#39;t. She had already called the other 
Senshi and told them to meet her here. Also, to a chorus of 
disagreements over her communicator, Makoto informed them she was going 
to take a look around and see what was going on so she could tell them 
once they got here.

Makoto sneaked around back of the old building to find another way in. 
&quot;Finally!&quot; Makoto whispered to herself as she found a small back door. 
Of course, as she tried the knob, it was locked. Luckily, women are 
always prepared for such situations. She pulled a hair clip out of her 
hair, broke it in half and used the broken clip as a lock pick. Once she 
got the lock open, but before opening the door, she transformed into 
Sailor Jupiter, then walked in as quietly as she could.

It was very dark inside, causing Makoto to have to wait several minutes 
for her eyes to adjust. Once they did, she realized she was in a huge 
room. Probably the manufacturing floor. Most of the equipment was long 
gone. Just a few discarded tools here and there, one or two large pieces 
of machinery, and chains hanging from a few old cranes were all that was 
left behind. In the center of the room, one of the chains appeared to 
have something hanging from the hook at the end. Even though it was too 
dark to tell for certain, Makoto was pretty sure what it was.

The tall senshi walked quietly across the floor. Once she got closer, 
she could tell, even in the darkness, that she was right about what the 
object was on the hook. Ami had her wrists tied together, with rope 
attached to the hook. Her feet were hanging off the ground, and she had 
on a black blindfold. Her captors had at least had the decency to wrap 
her in a discarded white cloth, probably thrown over a piece of 
equipment when the facility had closed. Once Makoto got to Ami, she 
reached up and started untying Ami&#39;s hands.

Makoto whispered to herself quietly, trying to boost her confidence a 
little, &quot;Time to play hero!&quot;

Ami, who had either been unconscious or asleep when Makoto had gotten to 
her, suddenly began struggling when she felt Makoto&#39;s hands touch hers. 
&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; she asked, sounding weak and more than a little scared.

Makoto stopped trying to untie her and gently put her hands on Ami&#39;s 
face, speaking quietly but also calmly and reassuringly, &quot;It&#39;s me, 
Makoto. I&#39;m getting you out of here. Now stop struggling so I can untie 
you.&quot;

Ami tried to speak, but coughed a bit for a moment before saying &quot;No, 
Makoto . . . not by yourself,&quot; just as Makoto got Ami&#39;s hands untied, 
causing Ami to groan as she fell to the floor like a sack of potatoes.

Makoto knelt down by Ami and whispered as she tried to help Ami to her 
feet, &quot;Can you move your legs?&quot;

Ami smiled quietly for a moment, then said sounding somewhat delirious, 
&quot;Are you asking me to dance?&quot; Then Ami slumped in Makoto&#39;s arms as she 
passed out again.

&quot;Guess I&#39;ll carry you. Time to go, Ami.&quot; As Makoto lifted Ami and 
started heading for the door, she couldn&#39;t help but think to herself how 
easy it had been to get in and actually get Ami. It was starting to look 
like she was going to get away scot-free after pulling the wool over the 
eyes of whoever had caught her long-time friend. Makoto almost regretted 
that, since she wanted to hurt the people who had done this to her. A 
good fight might have yielded answers and helped her to blow off steam. 
Little did Makoto know, she was about to learn an important lesson: be 
careful what you wish for.

Just as Makoto had taken a few steps, she heard her own voice from out 
of the darkness say angrily, &quot;Forget it! You&#39;re not going anywhere!&quot; The 
next thing Makoto felt was a sharp pain at the base of her skull. 
Dropping Ami, Makoto twirled around to defend herself. Then she felt the 
room keep spinning when she stopped and suddenly saw the ground rush up 
to meet her.

When Makoto came to, she winced as she opened her eyes. A light was 
turned on overhead, causing only the immediate area of the huge room to 
be visible. The light seemed so bright for a moment that Makoto felt 
like someone was jamming a knife in her eyes. Once her eyes stopped 
hurting, she could see Ami in front of her, lying on the ground, tied up 
again. This time, Ami&#39;s legs were tied together and her arms were tied 
behind her back. She still had the blindfold on. Next to Ami was a 
rectangular-shaped water cooler with ice water in it. When Makoto had 
gained most of her senses back, she tried to move, only to notice her 
hands were tied to a chair and her feet were tied together. Walking out 
of the darkness as if they were ghosts in the night and forming a circle 
around them were all five inner planetary sailor senshi, including 
Sailors Jupiter and Mercury. The only visible difference Makoto could 
see of the five of her captors was that where their uniforms should be 
white, they were black. Also, instead of gold tiaras, theirs were 
titanium silver in color. Despite their identical appearances, Makoto 
knew instantly that with the exception of poor Ami, she wasn&#39;t in the 
company of friends.

She realized she must have been out for a while, because the one that 
had obviously at this point impersonated Ami appeared to have sobered up 
a bit. Dark Sailor Mercury was the first to break the silence. &quot;Your 
friend here is tough to crack. It took us quite a while to get any 
information out of her.&quot; Dark Mercury emphasized the point by giving Ami 
a hard kick to her gut. Ami squirmed on the ground, making a croaking 
sound as she gasped for breath. Dark Mercury looked back at Makoto and 
said, &quot;She wouldn&#39;t answer most of our questions. All we were able to 
get out of her were your names. You should be proud of her. She stood up 
to my interrogation methods quite well. Impressive really.&quot;

Looking down at Ami and then back up at Dark Mercury, Makoto said 
angrily, &quot;You tortured her? When I get out of this chair I&#39;m going to 
kill you!&quot;

Dark Sailor Jupiter spoke up next. &quot;Now, now. Such violence really isn&#39;t 
necessary. Besides, tortured is such a strong word. I prefer alternative 
forms of persuasion myself. Don&#39;t worry. We won&#39;t waste our time trying 
them on you.&quot; Pointing at herself, Dark Sailor Jupiter said, &quot;I already 
know they won&#39;t work.&quot;

With that, Dark Mars threw in, sounding perfectly calm, &#39;That&#39;s right. 
So, we came up with a different plan.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re going to use &#39;alternative forms of persuasion&#39; on your little pal 
and make you watch. Since she won&#39;t talk, we figure hurting her in front 
of you is the best way to get you to speak.&quot; The comment came from Dark 
Venus.

Finally, Dark Sailor Moon stepped in front of Makoto. Looking down at 
her almost sadly, she said, &quot;We have many questions to ask you. 
Unfortunately we probably don&#39;t have time to ask them all since you most 
likely told your friends where we are. So I will make a deal with you. 
There is one very important question we want answered at the moment. If 
you answer it for us, we will let you and Ami go without any trouble.&quot; 
Looking into Makoto&#39;s angry green eyes, Dark Moon asked as politely as 
she could, almost begging Makoto to answer, &quot;How many Sailor Scouts are 
you aware of on your earth?&quot;

Hearing such things from people who looked so much like her closest 
friends caused Makoto to be shocked for a moment. But only a moment. 
Makoto looked up with an angry smile at Dark Moon and spoke quietly, but 
with as much venom as she could put into her words. &quot;Go spit!&quot;

Sailor Moon looked genuinely disappointed. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you feel that 
way,&quot; she said as she stepped back into the shadows, disappearing like a 
ghost, &quot;but you leave us no choice.&quot; With those words, Dark Mars and 
Dark Venus lifted Ami to her knees. Ami, who was still obviously in pain 
from the kick she received from her double, was now facing the water 
cooler.

Lita knelt down beside Makoto and whispered into her ear as she grabbed 
Makoto&#39;s jaw with her hand, forcing her to look forward, &quot;You will watch 
this while you think about answering our princess&#39;s question.&quot;

As Makoto was forced to watch, Dark Mercury grabbed Ami&#39;s hair. Ami, 
being unable to see due to her blindfold, didn&#39;t take a breath because 
she couldn&#39;t know what was about to happen as her head was suddenly 
forced underwater. For a moment, Ami, probably trying to be brave or out 
of shock, didn&#39;t move. Then she began to visibly squirm a little, then 
more and more until she was thrashing about in pure panic. The two 
holding her down were putting all their weight on Ami&#39;s shoulders to 
hold her under.

Makoto screamed out at the demonic versions of her friends in both anger 
at them and fear for her friend. &quot;Leave her alone!&quot; Just then, the two 
holding Ami raised her head out of the water, letting her gasp for air.

Dark Mercury looked up at Makoto and said quietly, &quot;It&#39;s a simple 
question. There isn&#39;t any need for you to prolong her suffering. Just 
answer it. How many Sailor Sekkou . . . I mean Senshi . . . are there 
defending your planet?&quot;

As Dark Mercury spoke, Makoto heard a sound that surprised her. Ami had 
caught her breath and started laughing. As Dark Mercury finished 
speaking, she spun around to face Ami. &quot;You find something amusing?&quot;

Ami answered, sounding almost entertained. &quot;Don&#39;t answer them, Makoto. 
If this is the best they can come up with, I&#39;ll be fine!&quot; Jupiter looked 
at Ami in shock as Ami said, clearly taunting the Sekkou, &quot;Come on guys! 
You were being so creative before!&quot; Then Ami laughed hysterically. 
Sailor Jupiter guessed that it was part of Ami&#39;s attempt not to crack 
under pressure as well as to try to help Makoto not worry about her as 
much.

Makoto got a cold feeling in her stomach when Dark Mercury looked at the 
tied and blind folded senshi of water with a psychotic smile. &quot;Do you 
realize how long you have even been here? You&#39;ve been in a pitch black 
room for several days now, with a blindfold on. I wonder how painful it 
would be if it were suddenly removed while you were forced to look at a 
really bright light? Might be an interesting experiment.&quot;

Ami started to tremble, but not from the cold water. She tried to pull 
away, twisting her head side to side, unable to hide the fear in her 
voice. As she felt Dark Mercury grab her blindfold, she yelled &quot;No, 
don&#39;t!&quot;

Then she felt the blindfold pulled away and squeezed her eyes shut 
tightly. Makoto could tell that even with her eyes shut, Ami was in some 
discomfort. Dark Mars and Venus, still holding Ami on her knees, were 
having a little more trouble holding her in place as she squirmed. Then 
Dark Mercury put her hand on Ami&#39;s face and forced open one of Ami&#39;s 
eyes with her fingers, causing the senshi of water to scream in agony 
from the pain.

&quot;I can see this is going to take a while,&quot; said Dark Mercury to Makoto, 
as she took her hand away from Ami&#39;s face. Ami squeezed her eyes shut, 
crying and sobbing.

Just as Dark Sailor Venus and Mars started to push Ami&#39;s head back under 
the cold water of the ice bucket, Ami sobbed out to Makoto, &quot;Don&#39;t 
answer them!&quot; And with that Makoto watched Ami&#39;s head as it was forced 
back into the bucket again. Ami started struggling as hard as she could, 
causing some of the water to spill over the side, but it was obvious her 
strength was leaving her.

Makoto said to herself loud enough for the dark reflection of herself 
holding her head to hear, &quot;It&#39;s time to do something.&quot; Then she shouted 
out, &quot;Are you guys going to just stand there all night? Now would be a 
wonderful time!&quot; Makoto jerked her head to the side, suddenly causing 
Dark Sailor Jupiter to lose her grip on Makoto&#39;s jaw. As Dark Jupiter 
tried to get a grip on Makoto&#39;s face again, Makato clamped down on her 
hand with her teeth, biting as hard as she could into her evil double&#39;s 
hand.

Almost as if it were planned that way, a fireball slammed into Dark 
Mars, as a chain seemingly made of light smacked Dark Venus upside the 
head, forcing them both to let go of Ami long enough for her to wiggle 
herself out of the water. She fell onto the floor, choking and gasping 
for breath.

Only a split second later, a disk shaped projectile made of light flew 
at Dark Mercury&#39;s head. Dark Mercury, having the most warning, suspected 
the attack and managed to dodge Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara just in the nick of 
time.

Dark Mercury, being the only one not hit by the sudden surprise attack, 
looked out into the dark room with shock and anger, but didn&#39;t waste any 
time or words before beginning the counterattack. She jumped into the 
air, hovering for a moment, pointed and shouted out, &quot;Water Poisoning 
Surprise!&quot; causing a huge sickly green ball of water to form in front of 
her and fly out in the general direction of where the fire ball had been 
flung from. The moment her feet hit the ground, she reached down, 
grabbing a small screw laying on the floor, and tossed it at the light, 
plunging the room into total darkness, which she knew would temporarily 
render everyone blind. Once the room was dark, she activated her visor 
and started scanning the room, hoping to use just a moment to try to 
find out how many intruders they were dealing with. Once she reached a 
count of only three she began trying to scan them for information on 
their power levels.

Dark Venus rose to her feet, and said, sounding surprised and angry, 
&quot;Hey! That&#39;s cheating!&quot; Dark Venus knelt down, gesturing toward one of 
the few large pieces of heavy machinery left in the building, shouting, 
&quot;Venus Metallic Crush!&quot; Suddenly the large machine which was bolted to 
the floor was surrounded by light for a moment, then went straight up, 
bringing some of the floor with it, and flew into the darkness in a 
line, swerving slightly so as to cover the area of origin for all three 
attacks, then knocking a huge hole in the wall as it slammed into the 
far side of the building.

Dark Mars had also apparently regained her footing. &quot;Time to put a 
little light back on the subject, I think.&quot; Then she shouted out her 
attack, &quot;Fire From Hell Ignite!&quot; Mars spun in a circle and pointed at a 
random area of the floor in the direction the Love Me Chain had come 
from. The floor where she pointed was suddenly a 10 foot diameter 
cylinder of fire from floor to ceiling, setting the roof on fire and 
causing an orange glow to light the room. Now the Dark Sekkou and Sailor 
Senshi could see each other all face to face like one big, unhappy, 
dysfunctional family.

Dark Jupiter growled at Makoto as she jerked her hand out of Sailor 
Jupiter&#39;s mouth, then punched her, sending Makoto and the chair she was 
tied into slamming down onto its side. Then she looked out across the 
now partially lit room, choosing a target. Settling on Sailor Moon, Dark 
Jupiter stomped both feet on the ground and slowly raised her hands as 
if lifting something heavy. Two large balls of electricity formed in her 
hands and she screamed &quot;Electric Shock Therapy!&quot; Then she sent the two 
balls of electricity smashing into Sailor moon, sending her flying.

As Usagi slid to a halt much farther from where she had been standing, 
she said, rubbing her head, &quot;They don&#39;t waste any time do they?&quot;

Sailor Moon got to her feet just in time to hear Rei yell out, &quot;Sailor 
Moon! Run!&quot;

The blond looked down and saw the ground starting to turn red. She 
decided now was a very good time to start taking Rei&#39;s advice and ran as 
fast as she could, just in time to feel the heat of the fire as Dark 
Mars&#39; attack flew from the ground. Then Usagi saw another large green 
ball of water slam on the ground right in front of her so hard it 
cracked the cement. The water also made the concrete that didn&#39;t break 
slick, causing her to slip and fall on her rear. Before Usagi could 
whine about the indignity of it all, the large piece of machinery that 
had flown through the air earlier came smashing back through the wall, 
forming another hole. Then it stopped for a moment in midair, as if 
searching out its target, and started sailing in the direction of Usagi.

Usagi was able to get to her feet surprisingly fast for a klutz and 
started running as fast as she could, dodging multiple walls of fire, a 
huge flying piece of machinery, balls of toxic water, and spheres of 
electricity by mere inches, screaming at the top of her lungs while 
flailing her arms.

While Usagi had the Dark Sekkou occupied, and Rei shouted out to Usagi 
when and were to run to, Minako had sneaked to where Makoto was and 
started untying her. Makoto said quietly to Minako, &quot;Great plan using 
Usagi as a diversion. Ami will be proud!&quot;

Minako answered &quot;Eh . . . it&#39;s not exactly how we planned it, but never 
slap a gift cow on the back right?&quot; Once Makoto was untied, she ran 
toward Ami while Minako started to sneak up behind Dark Mars, who was 
too busy trying to fry Usagi to notice her. Ami was still clenching her 
eyes closed as tight as she could, groaning in pain, once Makoto reached 
her. She put Ami&#39;s blindfold back on, and started untying her.

Once Makoto had Ami&#39;s feet and arms free, Ami asked as she was helped to 
her feet, &quot;I don&#39;t really know what&#39;s going on, but did you plan all 
this?&quot;

Sailor Jupiter said, a little embarrassed, &quot;Not really . . . it was 
kinda a rush job.&quot;

Ami coughed again, then weakly said, &quot;Well, you&#39;re still my hero.&quot; She 
leaned on the other Senshi as she walked, trying to keep her balance.

Just then, Makoto felt someone slam into her, knocking her and Ami to 
the ground. Sailor Jupiter looked up to see Ami was once again knocked 
unconscious after sliding a few feet away. Sailor Moon and Sailor Venus 
were fighting Dark Mercury, and Sailor Mars was keeping both Dark Venus 
and Dark Mars occupied. Enraged, Dark Sailor Jupiter loomed over her. 
Makoto had just enough time to wonder where Dark Sailor Moon was when 
she had to roll to avoid being stomped on by Dark Jupiter.

By the time Makoto got to her feet, her adversary had picked up Ami. 
When Sailor Jupiter started toward her, Dark Jupiter shouted out loud 
enough for everyone to hear, &quot;One more step and I break her neck!&quot; Once 
everyone realized what had happened, the fighting stopped. Dark Venus 
ordered Makoto, Rei, Minako, and Usagi to stand together in a nearby 
corner as Lita displayed their hostage proudly, almost as if she were a 
trophy.

Dark Venus said coldly, &quot;Now, we&#39;re all going to just wait here for Dark 
Sailor Moon to return, and once she does, you&#39;re all coming back with 
us. If anyone so much as moves, as my esteemed colleague said, 
Mizuno-san here dies right before your eyes.&quot; Then, to her fellow Dark 
Sekkou she asked, &quot;Where in the hell did she go anyway?&quot;

&quot;Right here.&quot;

All eyes turned upward to look on a high cat walk away from the part of 
the roof that was burning. Dark Sailor Moon was just standing there. But 
she wasn&#39;t the person who spoke. That would be the shorter girl wearing 
a purple Sailor Senshi outfit, with the sharp part of a glaive pressed 
against Dark Moon&#39;s neck. &quot;The four of you are big on giving out threats 
and hurting people. Let&#39;s see how well you respond to them.&quot;

Mina shouted toward the voice, &quot;Who the hell are you?&quot;

The small girl&#39;s reply was strangely calm. &quot;No concern of yours, if you 
cooperate.&quot;

Amy had seen the young girl before. From down below, Dark Mercury yelled 
up with mock friendliness in her voice, &quot;Why, if it isn&#39;t sweet little 
Hotaru.&quot; Then, clearly to anger her, Amy snapped out, &quot;Does this mean 
the rest of your sick pathetic family are sailor soldiers, by any 
chance?&quot;

Hotaru looked down angrily at Amy, but said calmly, &quot;No. And no more 
talking. They go free, or your princess dies.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have the stomach for it, little girl. Now be a good kid and 
put down the sharp object before you hurt yourself!&quot; was Mina&#39;s reply to 
Hotaru.

Hotaru looked down at them for another second, then changed position so 
that she was standing behind Serena. She touched the blade of the glaive 
to the back of Dark Moon&#39;s neck again, swung the the blade back then 
forward. Before it could slice into her neck, Ray shouted out, &quot;All 
right, shorty. You win.&quot;

It was only with lots of experience that Hotaru was able to stop the 
swing before cutting off Serena&#39;s head. When Hotaru looked down, Dark 
Jupiter had put Ami down and backed away from her several feet. A large 
portal opened behind them, and Lita shouted, &quot;Now, let her go.&quot;

Serena looked over her shoulder at Hotaru, saying, &quot;You should kill me 
while you still have the chance.&quot;

&quot;Perhaps. Go. Before I change my mind,&quot; was Hotaru&#39;s reply.

With that, a small portal opened up in front of Serena and she walked 
through it at the same time her companions did theirs. Just before the 
portal disappeared, Serena&#39;s voice called back to them. &quot;We will be 
back.&quot;
