<h1>Memories (part 6 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/coconut.html">The Coconut Cyclone</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/memories2-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>She&#146;s sleeping now, her hair tumbles in auburn waves across her 
pillow. Watching her like this reminds me of the old days when I&#146;d 
leave the gate to look in on her for a few moments while she slept 
after an especially hard battle. I did it with out her knowledge, 
knowing how upset she&#146;d be if she thought I was checking up on her. It 
wasn&#146;t that I did not have absolute confidence in her abilities as a 
warrior, it was simply that I needed to reassure my self that she was 
all right. 

I&#146;m here without her knowledge now. I had tried to avoid her after her 
visit, and that kiss, but I could not stay away for long. It seems 
that fate is working against me.

***

I had just returned from the gate. I felt that perhaps I could find 
some answers there. Time, however, felt that it did not have to tell 
its guardian anything about her troubles. I can&#146;t see the future, only 
possibilities, but even these were clouded in respect to my future 
with her. Mine is a fickle element indeed. 

Anyway I was barely through the door to our home when Michiru 
approached me. She told me that there had been a youma attack while I 
was away. This did not surprise me; random attacks were unfortunately 
common. Usually the creatures were incredibly weak and could be 
destroyed by one or two senshi without Sailor Moon&#146;s assistance. 
However, what she told me next stirred something deep within me. 

She said that the youma had attacked in the park. Haruka and Makoto 
happened to be training together in the area and went to deal with it. 
Things were fine at first; the youma appeared to be just like all the 
others. Yet, soon the tide changed. Somehow this particular creature 
had managed to amass a great deal of power.

Even though the youma was much stronger than they had originally 
anticipated, Uranus and Jupiter, being who they are, continued to 
fight it by themselves. They may be the most physically adept senshi, 
but their stubborn natures are a definite weakness. A weakness which 
the youma used to its advantage. It gradually began to wear them down. 
By the time the others sensed that something was amiss and reached 
them, they were in bad shape. 

My expression must have betrayed my concern, for Michiru then said, 
&quot;Don&#146;t worry they weren&#146;t badly hurt. A few cuts and bruises mostly, 
they were more exhausted than anything else.&quot; She continued the story, 
telling me how Sailor Moon had finally managed to finish the youma 
off, but I barely paid attention to her words. My mind was whirling 
with thoughts of Makoto. What if she had been seriously hurt and I 
hadn&#146;t been there? What if she had&#133; I did not allow myself to complete 
that particular thought. 

As soon as I was able, I went to my room to consider things. The need 
to make sure that Makoto was indeed all right pulled at me. Since it 
was already late in the evening when I had arrived home, I decided 
that I could chance a trip to Makoto&#146;s without being noticed. In a 
flash of light Sailor Pluto appeared in my room and then just as 
quickly vanished in to the night.

***

So now I stand here and watch her sleep. I should have left long ago 
yet I remain here in the darkness of her bedroom. Moonlight flows in 
through her sheer curtains and casts a slight glow over her sleeping 
form. She looks so lovely that my heart aches at the site of her. I 
turn away and glance out the window. It truly is a beautiful night. 
The stars shine brightly in the clear sky. I remember when I used to 
share nights with like this within the circle of her arms. 

I become so caught up in my thoughts of the past that I do not notice 
when she suddenly stirs. &quot;I was wondering when you&#146;d come and perform 
your traditional check up on me.&quot; She whispers sitting up in bed.

I turn, surprised at her words. &quot;You knew?&quot;

Her nod is barely detectable. &quot;I always know when you&#146;re near me.&quot;

&quot;Why did you never say anything?&quot;

&quot;I figured you would say something about it when you were ready. 
Besides, not that I&#146;d ever admit it to anyone else, but it was nice to 
have someone looking after me. It was nice to know that someone cared 
about me that much.&quot;

I turn back to the window. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Her reflection nods at 
me.

&quot;I&#146;m fine. Did you find what you were looking for at the gate?&quot;

A sad smile spreads across my face. &quot;No, time still refuses to show me 
anything.&quot; I pause and look over my shoulder at her. Her hair, down, 
flows around her. My hands ache with wanting to bury themselves in it. 
Her eyes are fixed on mine and even in this light I can see the 
feeling in them.

Is it real? Does she truly love me? I&#146;m still unsure, yet something 
the Queen once said comes to my mind, &quot;Sometimes, my dear Pluto, you 
just have to follow your heart.&quot;
