<pre>DREAMING  

The sun was setting on the horizon and its reflex seemed to melt in 
the surface of the sea like a giant orange fireball. The breeze was 
cool, but soothing after a hot summer day, and Haruka looked amazingly 
beautiful standing on the pier, smiling at her. &quot;Things are so 
different when we are together...it even seems like we could have a 
normal life,  without  the fear of loosing each other on a never 
ending battle&quot;.  

Michiru took a last glance at the sunset,  and turn to face her lover  
one more time...but she wasn&#39;t there anymore. Her heart started to 
pound strongly on her chest, everything around lost the color of life, 
the sun just disappeared in the bottom of the sea, and the water on 
the shore  turned completely black. The darkness spread rapidly on the 
rest of the  ocean, and painted the pier underneath her feet like a 
bottle of black  ink spilt over a white sheet of paper.  

------------------------------------------------------------

The window hit the wall, pushed violently by the first winds of winter  
and Michiru woke up of her dream with a kiss of snow in her face. She  
was sweating profusely, and her hands were shaking. 

&quot;Are you ok honey?&quot;  said Haruka while getting up and closing the 
window with one move. 

&quot;Yes, I just had a bad dream Haruka, but I&#39;m fine now&quot; 

&quot;If you want ...I can make it all better&quot; and with a childish grin on 
her  face she took her in her arms and both fell back in bed.  

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Oh my...not in my shift...&quot; The keyboard filled the room with the 
fast  clicking and the astronomy trainee shook his head in regret. He 
forgot  to turn on the recording session while moving the giant 
telescope to  search the skies, and missed the opportunity of his life 
being the only  witness of a strange phenomenon: for a split of a 
second, the last planet  of the solar system, Pluto, disappeared. It 
wasn&#39;t an eclipse. Even with the benefits of space-time, it would have 
lasted longer. It wasn&#39;t a  magnetic storm, nor any other solved 
mystery of the physics. He saw it.  

It vanished. He took the telephone and called his colleague from the  
deserted astronomy lab beside the Andes. He didn&#39;t want to sound  
inexperienced. After an informal conversation about exams and lack of 
sleep,  he went to the point: &quot;do you have any records of anything 
unusual around  Pluto&#39;s orbit? The bracket time is between 02.08.45 
and 02.10.00 ?&quot; 

&quot;Well, to be honest with you we are gathering information about 
Ganimedes  at the moment...but let me check out the satellite&#39;s 
readings&quot;. Said this,  and the servers started their work, bouncing 
numbers all over the nets of  the world. &quot;Why did you ask?&quot; 

&quot;err...I just have a blank in my records, that&#39;s all, and I don&#39;t want 
my  boss get on to me for that&quot; 

&quot;Forgot to push the red button, uh?...hahahha, well...let&#39;s 
see...hum... boring as usual, nothing new, pal, don&#39;t worry,  you 
didn&#39;t miss anything.&quot; 

&quot;Thanks...talk to you later&quot;.  

But he wasn&#39;t mistaken, he did see it vanishing, but now it was there,  
like laughing at him, after giving a wink with an evil eye.  Pluto 
would be always a question mark in his astronomy knowledge, and he 
would have no explanation of what he saw, but he&#39;d never talked about 
it.  

------------------------------------------------------------

In a room not too far from Haruka and Michiru&#39;s, the young woman 
struggled  in her sleep. Her expression had a mix of sadness and 
anguish, and the  knuckles of her delicate fingers were pale and 
colorless from the close grip  her hand had of her bed covers.  

&quot;...I  walked a lonely mile in the moonlight 
and though a million stars were shining 
my heart was lost in a distant planet 
that whirls around the April moon 
whirling in an arc of sadness 
I&#39;m lost without you... 
I&#39;m lost without you... 
Though all my kingdoms turn to sand 
And fall into the sea, 
I&#39;m mad about you 
I&#39;m mad about you.&quot;  

The music was like a whisper coming from the little speaker over the 
night  stand, and the light of the alarm clock gave the room a red 
tint that  painted the walls like a bleeding house.   

&quot;And I have never in my life 
felt more alone than I do now; 
although I claim dominions over all I see, 
it means nothing to me. 
There are no victories, 
In all our histories, without love.&quot;  

A clarinet sounded in the background like a deep long sigh; with a 
sudden  move the woman woke up, sat on the bed and opened her eyes. 
With that,  Setsuna Meioh lost her control of the Gates of Time. It 
was 02.08.45 on her  alarm clock.  </pre>
