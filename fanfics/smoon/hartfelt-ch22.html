<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch21.html">Back to Part 21</a><p><u>(Usagi)</u></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p><b>“…</b><b>Usagi...”</b></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Where 
are you Usagi?”</b></p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>…<i>Is…</i></p><p>…<i>.Someone 
there…?</i></p><p><b>…</b><i><b>ping…</b></i></p><p>Usagi blinked, and was startled when she 
was met by a horizon of darkness. Everywhere she looked there was a void of 
nothingness.</p><p><i>Huh? Where am I? This doesn’t look like the palace. 
</i></p><p>Hesitantly the youth turned her head and scanned at her surroundings. The 
princess had seemingly been marooned within a sea of darkness. Her body-- it was like a 
pale, ghostly spectre that was encompassed by a faint, white light.</p><p><i>Where is 
everyone? Mother...? Setsuna...? Hotaru...? Where are you?! </i>She cried out, but no one 
answered.</p><p><i>Oh...that’s right. Hotaru is already...</i> In her mind she saw her 
sister being led away by a tall figure. <i>Hotaru... That’s right, I have to find her! I 
have to bring her back home!</i></p><p>She began to wander the empty void, shouting the 
girl’s name until her throat was hoarse.</p><p><i>...Hotaru!! Hotaru, where are you?! Please 
come back! </i> She ran until suddenly she came across a pair of conversing women. Judging 
from their appearance, they were a part of the palace staff.</p><p><i>Oh! There are some of 
the maids. Maybe, they can tell me where Hotaru is.</i></p><p>“<i>Excuse me?”</i> She was 
surprised when the two women ignored her and continued to speak to one another in a low 
whisper. <i>“Umm...Excuse me.” </i>She said a little more firmly. Still, she wasn’t getting 
any reaction.</p><p>Usagi took a step back and tilted her head to the side. <i>That’s 
strange. Why are they ignoring me? </i>Being ignored really did hurt her feelings, but those 
thoughts were promptly swept into the back of her mind. <i>“I’m sorry, I don’t mean to 
interrupt but I was wondering if either of you have--” </i>She touched one of their 
shoulders and instantly there was a bright flash of light. Usagi pulled her hand back as 
their voices were suddenly loud and clear in her mind.</p><p>“<i>Mary, have you seen the 
young Miss of late?”</i></p><p>“<i>Who are you speaking of? Are you speaking of Lady Usagi 
or...?”</i></p><p>“<i>You know who.”</i></p><p>Usagi blinked. <i>“You know who...?” </i>She 
gasped, <i>“Are you talking about Hotaru?” </i>Her hopes were dashed when she was ignored 
once again. This time, she couldn’t help but make a face. This prank was really getting 
old.</p><p>“<i>Oh... Umm... then no, I’m afraid I haven’t. Why?”</i></p><p>“<i>The rumour 
amongst the guards is that the young Lady is missing.”</i></p><p>“<i>Missing?! But how can 
that be? We haven’t put the plan into action yet--”</i></p><p>“<i>Excuse me. If I may ask, 
what are you two speaking about?”</i></p><p>“<i>Oh! L-Lady Setsuna! W-We were just going 
back to work! Please-excuse-us!”</i></p><p><i>Setsuna? </i>Usagi felt her heart skip a beat 
when the stoic woman suddenly came into view. <i>It’s really her...</i> She couldn’t 
understand it, for some inexplicable reason it felt like her heart was about to burst from 
joy. She had only seen her guardian a few hours ago after all.</p><p>“<i>Setsuna! It’s so 
good to see you!” </i>Usagi enthusiastically greeted. But it appeared that the she hadn’t 
heard her. The tall advisor watched as the maids ran off with a contemplating look in her 
eyes. <i>“Umm...Setsuna? Is there something wrong?” Ah! Oh no. What if she’s angry with me? 
“I-I didn’t mean to eavesdrop on them, really! It’s just... happened! I was just looking for 
Hotaru! Oh! Speaking of which...By any chance have you seen her? I can’t seem to find her 
anywhere...”</i></p><p>“<i>...”</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna...? Hey, wait! Where are you going?” 
</i>To Usagi’s horror, her friend turned around and began to walk away from her. <i>“No, 
wait!” </i>She threw out her hand and tried to catch her, but Setsuna disappeared right 
before her very eyes. She was suddenly gone.</p><p>Usagi fell to her knees in shock. 
<i>“What... just happened?” Why did she just disappear like that? It was like she wasn’t 
even there.</i></p><p><b>Ping...</b></p><p><i>Wait a second. Not even there? But, where is 
here...? The last thing I remember, I was...</i></p><p><b>Ping...</b></p><p>Usagi gasped. 
<i>“Goddess...” I don’t remember. But, what does that mean? What...happened to 
me?</i></p><p>A series of distorted images flickered through her mind, but she could not 
clearly discern them. It was a blur of faces and voices.</p><p><i>It feels like... I’m 
forgetting something very important. So, why can’t I...remember...? What is it? What am I 
forgetting?!</i></p><p>“AHHHHHHHHHH!” The ground beneath her had suddenly disappeared. Usagi 
shut her eyes tight, waiting for the inevitable end. But it never came. Instead, she kept 
falling head first amongst the shimmering 
lights.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p><i><b>Crash!</b></i></p><p>Before her eyes, a building 
collapsed. The sound tickled something in her memory. It was not just one building, but 
many.</p><p><i>What...?</i> Usagi felt her heart race in her chest.<i> I don’t 
understand---what is this?</i></p><p>“<b>Usagi.” </b>The echoing voice beckoned to her once 
again.</p><p><i><b>Lubb dubb!</b></i></p><p>“<i>Stay back!”</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>Mother?! </i>For a brief second she glimpsed her mother’s concerned 
face before it was engulfed by a bright flash of white light and disappeared into the 
nothingness. Suddenly, it was quiet. She was aware that she was trembling. There were tears 
falling down her face. Somewhere in her heart, she had the feeling that something terrible 
had happened.</p><p>The princess felt her body straighten around as she finally touched hard 
ground again. Unconsciously she scanned her surroundings again. The images and the lights 
were all gone.</p><p><i>No. It can’t be...</i></p><p>She was about to break down into tears 
again until she felt a strange presence nearby.</p><p>“<i>Who’s there? Mother, is that 
you?”</i></p><p><b>Tup.</b></p><p>A movement out of the corner of her eye drew her 
attention. Instantly she spun on the spot to confront the shadowed figure, and what she saw 
made her blue eyes widen. She heard it first. There was the jingle of a bell, followed by a 
glint of light reflecting off a sharp surface. The sharp tip of a blade was centimetres from 
her throat.</p><p>Usagi couldn’t move as the person’s red eyes trained on her from the 
shadows.</p><p><i>It can’t be--!!</i></p><p><b>Rap! Rap! Rap!</b></p><p><u>(Moon 
Kingdom—Palace)</u></p><p><b>Rap! Rap! Rap!</b></p><p>“Young Lady, it is time to get up! 
You’ve overslept!” Someone called. “Miss…? Princess Usagi, please get up! Ooo---hh… THAT 
WOMAN will surely scold me if you are late for today’s lesson…”</p><p>Usagi’s lithe body 
stirred underneath the concealing sheets. Everywhere one looked her room was decorated in 
white. However, at this time of day, the walls were now tinged yellow and orange—a gift from 
the outside world. With it, nature also greeted the innocent and pure woman. Through the 
double doors of the nearby terrace, a gentle breeze drifted inside to ruffle her long, 
golden locks. Usagi’s breathing quickened. She rolled a few times, shifting her position 
until she finally came to rest on her back. In her mind, the face of the person was coming 
slowly into sight. A single beam of light crept along the right side of their face and 
crossed over the bridge of their nose. She could see their lips curl up into a 
smile.</p><p>“Hotaru!”</p><p><i>Ah--!</i> Usagi bolted upright in her bed and instantly felt 
dizzy. She limply fell back down onto her back, waiting until the feeling passed, before she 
weakly scanned the familiar surroundings. “Oh. I’m in my room?”</p><p><i>So it was just a 
dream?</i> <i>But it felt so real! There were buildings being destroyed... And Hotaru was 
there too. But she... </i>Usagi tightened her hold on the sheets. The tip of the blade still 
felt very real. <i>But that’s why...it has to be a crazy dream. Even though we haven’t seen 
each other for years, the Hotaru that I know would never do something like that. 
</i></p><p>“Princess Usagi!” The maid moaned again. On the other side of the door a sound of 
clumsy fumbling for keys could be heard.</p><p>“Oh! There is no need for that. I’m awake!” 
Usagi called out to the servant. She peeked at her clock, which confirmed the severity of 
her lateness. “Uh oh. I better hurry!”</p><p>The young woman tossed the sheets aside and 
made a mad dash for her closet.</p><p>An eternity seemed to have passed before the door 
swung open to finally reveal the young Miss properly dressed. Although the beautiful, 
golden-haired princess was admired throughout the kingdom and was considered an invaluable 
gift from the Gods by her people, Usagi still had her share of flaws. This would be one of 
them.</p><p>“Always… Every morning Lady Usagi!” The maid chided before she sighed with 
relief. She hated to think of what would have happened if the young miss didn’t wake up when 
she did. There were certain consequences for tardiness.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I will try harder 
to wake up on time,” She sincerely promised. The bad dream that had haunted her so strongly 
now faintly lingered within her consciousness, but it was quickly fading to the back 
recesses of her mind. There were more important matters on hand.</p><p>“Well… I suppose I’ll 
have to take your word for it,” The shorter woman gestured. “Her Majesty would be worried 
sick if you were late to your lesson.”</p><p>“Hmm…Yes, I suppose that’s true. However, my 
mother isn’t the one you are really afraid of. It’s Luna, isn’t it?” She saw the woman 
‘irk’. “Well, I can’t say that I blame you. She <i>can</i> be rather strict. Poor Luna… 
she’s already getting on in the years. If she wasn’t so hard on Artemis I’m sure he would 
have made his move by now.”</p><p>“Y-Young Miss! T-T-That’s hardly appropriate!” <i>She 
might hear you! </i></p><p>“But do you not agree?” Usagi took the woman’s hands into hers 
and made a pleading face. There was no chance in heaven or hell that anyone could resist 
THAT look, especially from the princess; the maid couldn’t help but shyly meet those 
beautiful eyes and smile in secret agreement.</p><p>A small, stifled cough caused the two 
women freeze.</p><p>“’Getting on in the years’?” The voice questioned indignantly.</p><p>The 
pair nervously gulped peered around the seemingly empty corridor.</p><p>“W-Wasn’t that who I 
think it is? You heard it too didn’t you Lady Usagi? Or am I losing my mind?” The young maid 
squeaked. She had only met the assistant advisor and royal planner once, and once was enough 
to last her a lifetime! However, the said person was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>When they 
were coming up empty handed with detecting the mysteriously, well-hidden presence, an 
obvious thought struck Usagi in the head-- why hadn’t she thought of it before? After all, 
this happened often enough.</p><p>Giggling a little, the teenager dropped her gaze to 
predictably find a black cat with red eyes staring up at her in accusation. The crescent 
moon on its forehead gleamed in the morning light.</p><p>“And a good morning to you Luna! 
How are you doing this lovely day?” Usagi greeted her supervisor. But the greeting seemed to 
only serve to irritate the being further.</p><p>“Good morning?! It’s already the early 
afternoon! What were you doing sleeping in so late?!” The cat screeched.</p><p>“Ehehe…heh… 
I’m sorry, it just...happened?” She apologized again and gestured nervously. The maid beside 
her frantically looked back and forth between the apologetic princess and the… 
cat?</p><p><i>Wait. The cat is talking?</i></p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>It hit her like a wrecking 
ball.</p><p>“OH MY GODDESS! A TALKING CAT!” Usagi barely blinked twice when two frightened 
arms wrapped under her shoulders, picked her up, and dragged her down the corridor at an 
amazing speed. “D-Don’t worry my Lady! I’ll protect you from the demon!”</p><p>“HEY NOW!” 
Luna growled and gave chase. “Put the Princess down this instant! And you, Lady Usagi! Stop 
that laughing, right now! This is no joking matter!”</p><p>Moments later, with tears still 
in her eyes, the Moon Princess finally managed to calm down the nerve-frazzled servant. She 
had heard that her guardian had been crowned the title of ‘demon’ many times before, but 
never while the other woman was around to hear it.</p><p>“It’s all right, that cat isn’t a 
demon.” Usagi tried to explain to her friend. “You remember Luna don’t you?”</p><p>The other 
woman nodded quickly.</p><p>“Well, that’s her.” The maid’s face paled as she slowly turned 
her head towards where her Lady was pointing.</p><p>“Yes, the cat.” Luna rolled her eyes 
when she saw that predictable expression. Normally she assumed this form to keep an eye over 
her charges. However, now that she had been found out she saw no reason to retain this cat 
body any longer. With a quick mental command, the crescent moon on her forehead lit up and 
she reversed the spell.</p><p><i><b>Poof!</b></i></p><p>As the clouded blue smoke started to 
dissipate away, Usagi went on to explain the peculiarities of this phenomenon.</p><p>“You 
see, Luna can take on the form of a cute little kitty to spy on me. I find it absolutely 
adorable—I almost wish I could do it as well! Isn’t she simply amazing?!”</p><p>“S-So… all 
of her Majesty’s close subjects can…?” <i>Umm, amazing? Sure.</i></p><p>“Oh, no, no, silly! 
As far as I know, only Luna and Artemis can undergo the transformation.”</p><p>“I-I see.” 
<i>That makes sense… I think?</i></p><p>“Quite right.” Luna agreed in her serious tone. She 
now stood before her audience in her human form; her eye color had changed from red to blue. 
Her slender form was complimented by a golden dress, and her long dark hair hung along her 
back.</p><p>“Lady Usagi, I do wish that you would keep up appearances, even within the 
palace. One would never know when a Lord or Lady of Apollo’s court may grace us with their 
company! And as I am your guardian, appointed to you by your Mother, her Majesty the Queen, 
I cannot allow you to bring humiliation and embarrassment to yourself or your people! One 
day YOU will be our Queen! You cannot afford to dawdle with your schedule—there are only so 
many hours in a day!” Luna cried in exasperation.</p><p>Usagi quietly nodded to her 
petrified friend, telling her that it was okay to leave. The young princess knew this 
lecture well.</p><p>“Today there is the daily meditation and aura control lessons with your 
mother, the balancing, speech and dining etiquette practices, and, for today, a special 
flower arrangement session. The royal florist has graciously offered an hour of her own busy 
schedule to teach you the basics of which we will alternate later with your piano 
lessons.”</p><p>A weak smile made its way to the Moon Princess’s face. She found it simply 
astonishing at how surreal her duties felt at that moment.</p><p><i>Things were never this 
bad when Hotaru was here. Ever since she disappeared, everyone now expects me to become the 
heir. But, honestly...I don’t care about any of that. I just want Hotaru to come home safe 
and sound. I miss her dearly… </i></p><p><i>I still remember when we all found out. Mother 
ordered a Kingdom wide search. We all tried our best to find her, we all looked so hard! But 
no matter what we did... there was no trace of her anywhere. Some people, I heard, feared 
that she was no more.</i></p><p><i>But they’re wrong! </i></p><p><i>I know in my heart that 
she’s still alive. She’s out there somewhere. </i>Usagi brought up a hesitate hand to her 
chest. <i>Because... I can still feel it, </i><i>her heart... It’s always been here with me. 
Before the day we were born, every day and every night while we wished each other a better 
tomorrow… </i></p><p><i>So...Where are you, Hotaru…? Why did you leave? Did I, do something 
to upset you?</i></p><p>“Then we must---”</p><p>“Luna…?”</p><p>“Hm?” The raving woman paused 
momentarily to see her charge regarding her with an anxious gaze; the goofy features all had 
gone and were replaced by utmost seriousness. This immediately caught the guardian’s 
attention and piqued her interest. “Yes?”</p><p>“Has anyone heard anything of Hotaru 
yet?”</p><p>Luna’s gaze fell. “No. I am afraid not. But rest assured, Lady Usagi, there are 
many search parties still ongoing on the Moon, and I have heard word that Lady Neptune and 
Aphrodite, and Sir Uranus, Jupiter and Mercury have all promised Her Majesty that they would 
also keep a look out for the young princess as well. If Lady Hotaru is anywhere within this 
Solar System, we will surely find her.”</p><p>“I see. I’m really glad to hear that. I hope 
we find her soon.”</p><p>“Please do not worry about it. Everything that can be done is being 
taken care of. The best thing you can do now, however, is to not worry yourself sick, but to 
concentrate on your studies.”</p><p>“She’s right.” Another, deeper voice rang out. “As harsh 
as it may sound.”</p><p>A tall, white haired, blue eyed man in a white suit approached the 
two women. He had a gentle air to him, a bright one that positively radiated loyalty and 
strength with each step he took. While the young Moon Princess happily accepted this 
individual’s presence, Luna remained relatively indifferent if not annoyed. The woman’s 
reception was borderline, lukewarm at best.</p><p>“Artemis!”</p><p>“Hey there... I see that 
you’re finally awake. That’s good! Did you rest well?”</p><p>“Yes. And I’m very sorry for 
sleeping in for so long.” Usagi gave a quick bow in respect.</p><p>The gesture made Artemis 
laugh. “There’s no need to apologize. No one’s perfect. Besides, you are still a growing 
young woman and...I think you deserve to relax once in awhile in your own home.”</p><p>“Bite 
your tongue, Artemis!” Luna snapped. “Now is not the time for relaxing! There is a lot of 
work to be done! And you should be setting a good example for Lady Usagi as well. Perhaps if 
you got up in time for once in your life--”</p><p>“Ah… yes, yes… I will work on 
that.”</p><p>“Plus, you are in need of a haircut soon as well. As high ranking loyal 
subjects of Her Majesty, we must keep up our appearances as well.”</p><p>“Yes 
Luna…”</p><p>“And the combat training...?” She shot him a threatening look. “Don’t even 
think about re-scheduling it again! Our cat transformations should not be used for 
‘skipping’ work to indulge in wild shenanigans! Do I make myself 
clear?”</p><p>“Ulp…”</p><p><i>Wow. She got you good.</i> Usagi silently 
thought.</p><p><i>Yeah, no kidding. </i>Artemis thought back.</p><p>“Good. Now, let’s see... 
Oh yes, I need to go and report to Her Majesty. In the meantime, would you please escort 
Lady Usagi to the gardens? Setsuna should be there to brief you on today’s 
lesson.”</p><p>Without so much as waiting for a reply Luna was already off and making her 
way down the corridor, leaving poor Artemis and Usagi staring dumbly at her distancing back. 
None of them were surprised by her strict attitude. The woman was infamous for it. But it 
was that strange ambience of her departure that brought them both to wonder what could make 
her rush like that.</p><p>“Wow, look at her go. I guess it must be really important.” Usagi 
guessed.</p><p>“Hmm… I suppose.” Artemis muttered. He continued to watch after his partner 
until she transformed into her cat form and dashed around the corner. He had to agree with 
the princess; there was something misplaced of their given situation. The man was acutely 
aware of the wind fluctuations within the palace of late. They were too erratic for his 
taste, even as he chatted with the young Lady.</p><p>“Do you have any idea what it could be 
about?”</p><p>“Hm? Ah. Well, no, not exactly! A-Anyway! I’m sure it’s nothing we need to 
worry about! Luna is a very independent woman. I’m sure she can handle whatever it is. In 
the meantime however, perhaps we should make our way down to the garden? If we don’t she 
might scold us again later.”</p><p><i>The garden…? </i>Usagi’s heart skipped a beat. <i>No, 
not there!</i> A voice inside spoke out.</p><p>“Lady Usagi?” Artemis inquired with a worried 
expression. He hadn’t meant to scare his young charge with the remark, but that look just 
then was something else.</p><p>“Oh! I--I was just thinking. It’s nothing to worry 
about.”</p><p>“Are you sure? If you aren’t feeling well, I can cancel the lesson.” He 
offered.</p><p>“No. No, it’s all right. I’m perfectly fine. Besides, Luna will throw a fit 
if she knew.”</p><p>The man gave a small chuckle at that. “Heh. If she did, I’m not sure if 
I’d survive… BUT it is my duty to risk my life for my Princess, no matter what the 
situation! Or who...”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Hey! What’s with that face? You don’t believe me, 
do you?”</p><p>“Oh, I believe you.” Usagi smiled. As she stepped forward along the corridor, 
her dress twirled with her. “Just not against Luna. No offense Artemis, but it looks like 
she’s got you pretty whipped there.”</p><p>“Hey... That’s so mean...” He stopped and quickly 
glanced around, drawing a curious stare from Usagi.</p><p><i>What is he looking 
for?</i></p><p>“Psst. I’ll race you to the garden.”</p><p>Usagi’s smile couldn’t get any 
bigger.</p><p>“C’mon, is that all you’ve got?!”</p><p>“Oh, give me a break! You aren’t the 
one running in a dress!”</p><p>As they raced towards the gardens, the heavy feeling in the 
Princess’s chest wouldn’t leave.</p><p><i>What is this strange feeling…? It’s a clear sky 
outside, but, it feels like... there’s a dark cloud looming over our 
heads...</i></p><p>…</p><p><b>“…</b><b>Usagi…”</b></p><p><u>(Moon Garden)</u></p><p>Usagi 
found it utterly impossible to concentrate on Setsuna’s briefing. The Queen’s Advisor was 
rambling on about where a person’s power came from, but her charge was too preoccupied 
within her thoughts to notice. There were many questions that the golden-haired woman wanted 
to ask, but the words refused to form on her lips. It was as though the atmosphere 
surrounding them forbade it, as if a delicate balance would be thrown out of order if any of 
these fears were ever made known. So Usagi simply sat there and pretended to 
listen.</p><p><i>Back then, when he mentioned the garden, why did I suddenly think that I 
didn’t want to come here? I mean, I’ve always come here when I needed to think or relax... 
so why...?</i></p><p>She couldn’t shake the feeling of being oppressed, but logic made the 
thought seem ridiculous.</p><p>“That will be it until Her Majesty arrives. Please do not 
leave the premises,” Setsuna instructed. She waited until her charge gave a quick nod before 
dismissing herself.</p><p><i><b>fwooooooosssssh…</b></i></p><p>Now, Usagi was alone in the 
vast garden. A gentle breeze blew across the field. It lifted up the sweet scents of nearby 
flowers and scattered their petals. It was peaceful. Quiet. However, it had the opposite 
effect on the Princess and strangely stirred her heart. Once again, she felt that terrible, 
nagging feeling that she had forgotten something important.</p><p><i>What am I 
forgetting?</i> There was a brief flash of images, but the background noise came out like 
static.</p><p>Silently, Usagi stood up and stepped over to a close-by flowerbed. She reached 
out to touch the soft petals of a red rose, touching it, caressing the velvet smooth 
material beneath her fingertips. She then inhaled deeply, taking in the mixtures of scents 
and breathed out just as slowly. Her blue eyes darted up to the clear sky overhead and felt 
the rays of light warm the delicate skin of her cheeks. As far as one could tell, it was a 
beautiful—if not perfect—summer day. However, for some reason she felt tense; all of her 
instincts were on the alert for a reason that completely mystified her. Her heart was racing 
within her chest with each passing second, as though she was running out of 
time.</p><p><i>For some reason... everything feels so wrong. Is it because of that dream? 
Why couldn’t I ask Setsuna when she was right there? It felt like, my voice was suddenly 
gone, like I couldn’t speak.</i></p><p>A small yawn escaped her lips.</p><p><i>Oh. 
</i><i>That’s odd. Why, am I suddenly…tired? I was just fine... two... seconds ago… 
</i></p><p>Before she could even finish the thought, Usagi fell to the ground into a deep 
slumber.</p><p><u>(Some time 
later…)</u></p><p>“<b>Usagi.”</b></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Wake up 
Usagi.”</b></p><p>The Princess shivered when an insistent breeze brushed up against her bare 
shoulder. She yelped when a mass of flower petals flew into her face and scrambled to get 
up.</p><p>“Huh?! I-I fell asleep?”</p><p>Her heart caught in her throat when she took in a 
view of the sky; it was no longer blue, but an ominous, dark gray. The sunlight had been 
chased away, the flowers were becoming scattered, some of them, were ripped right out from 
their roots, and the wind began to howl in her ears. From where she stood she could make out 
a small section of their kingdom in the distance. Scenes from her dream cropped up again, 
making the heir feel very ill. Another wave of the strong vibes forced Usagi to bend over 
and clutch at her stomach painfully.</p><p><i>Why am I getting such a bad feeling?! Where is 
it coming from?</i></p><p>“Usagi!”</p><p>The woman weakly looked up to see a white cat 
closing the distance between them. When the creature was within a few meters of her, Artemis 
transformed into his human form.</p><p><i><b>Poof!</b></i></p><p>“Artemis...?”</p><p>“Thank 
Goddess I found you! You have to come with me this instant! We must get out of her—Now!” He 
gripped her arm hard and pulled her forward.</p><p>“Go? Go where? What is 
happening?!”</p><p>“There’s no time to explain! Setsuna and Luna are waiting for us in the 
Audience Chamber.”</p><p>Usagi couldn’t get another question out before she was pulled down 
a series of corridors behind her urgent guardian. As they fled through the palace, the 
ominous feeling intensified.</p><p><i>That’s strange. It feels like, I’ve seen this before. 
But that can’t be—I can feel his hand! It’s cold and clammy. </i>It felt real.</p><p><b>Tup! 
Tup! Tup!<br>Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>“This way, hurry!” Luna waved them down a 
corner.</p><p>“What’s the status of our situation?” Artemis huffed as his companion joined 
them.</p><p>“All I can say is… It’s not good.”</p><p>“Damn.”</p><p>“W-What’s not good?” 
Usagi panted behind them. Her friends turned their heads and briefly peered over at the 
younger woman, but neither took it upon themselves to elaborate.</p><p><i>What are they 
hiding from me?</i> It hurt that they were keeping her in the dark, but she didn’t have the 
heart to confront them about it. There had to be a good reason why they were doing 
it.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!<br>Tup! Tup! Tup!<br>Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></p><p><b>Rmm…rmm…rmm…</b></p><p><i>What?!</i></p><p>“T-The ground’s shaking?!” The 
Moon Princess came to a stop when the palace walls shook all around them. The sinking 
feeling in her stomach deepened.</p><p>“Don’t stop!” Luna and Artemis 
ordered.</p><p>“But---!”</p><p>“Keeping 
moving!”</p><p><i><b>Crumble---Crash!</b></i></p><p>Despite the increasing tremors, the 
group safely reached the audience chamber where Setsuna awaited them. Upon their entry into 
the spelled area, the doors were immediately closed and they were sealed from the 
inside.</p><p>“Don’t worry. As long as you remain here, you are safe.” Setsuna informed 
them.</p><p>“Thanks Setsuna, we really owe you one.” Artemis nodded.</p><p>As Usagi 
recovered from the stressful run, she glanced around the chamber only to see that they were 
alone.</p><p><i>Wait a minute...</i></p><p>“Where is everyone? Where are the palace staff, 
and my mother? Are we the only ones here? Are they all still out there?!” She turned her 
gaze on her guardians. “Why did we have to run like that?! What’s... going on out there?! 
Someone, please! Tell me!” Usagi pleaded. She saw Luna, Artemis and Setsuna all exchange 
worried glances. “Please…” When they continued to refuse to answer to her, she stared them 
each in the eye and brought herself to assert her authority. The very thought of having to 
use such a tactic pained her, but being in the dark, being uninformed, it wasn’t 
fair.</p><p>“As your Princess, I command you to report the situation to me!”</p><p>As 
surprised as they all were, Luna and Artemis couldn’t find the words to describe their 
situation to their charge. However, Setsuna willed herself to deliver the news. She was 
bound by duty and was obligated to bend to a certain degree. However, being the intelligent 
person that she was, she had partially anticipated this and would not reveal more than 
necessary.</p><p>“We have…sensed a disturbance growing on our outer borders.” The Advisor 
tentatively explained. “It is a strong, but negative energy. None of us have ever sensed 
anything quite like it before now.”</p><p>“Setsuna, that’s enough.” Luna tried to 
interrupt.</p><p>“Some believe that it is the Sun God, Apollo, seeking revenge on us for 
deserting his ranks several centuries ago.”</p><p>“For deserting his ranks...? I don’t quite 
understand. Who is this Apollo person?”</p><p>“That’s enough Setsuna!” The dark-haired woman 
stepped between Setsuna and Usagi, just daring her to try and continue that line of thought. 
However, the advisor appeared to have said her share.</p><p>“So, it really is an attack…” 
Usagi whispered. Her knees suddenly felt weak. She had never seen a real battle before-- 
where people actually fought with their lives at stake and died. The woman had grown up 
sheltered, and was especially overprotected since her sister’s mysterious disappearance. But 
now, suddenly, there was an attack?</p><p><i>But why...Why would anyone want revenge on us? 
We didn’t do anything wrong! </i></p><p>Reality slowly dawned on the woman and she realized 
how frightening real her dream was becoming. It was all coming back to her, clearer with the 
passing time.</p><p>“My mother.” Usagi remembered. “Where is my Mother?! Where is everyone 
else? If there truly is an attack, then why aren’t we helping the others? It’s our duty to 
help our people, is it not?!”</p><p>“We have been assigned to stay with you here, Lady 
Usagi.” Luna answered. “It was under the orders of your Mother…”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“We’re 
here to guard you if things get rough,” Artemis clarified. He then took a deep breath. “Your 
Mother, Queen Serenity has decided… no, <i>insisted</i> that she would go and quell the 
disturbance herself. Until she comes back we are to wait here.”</p><p>“No…You can’t mean 
that! She’s going to fight alone?! We can’t let that happen! It’s too dangerous! We have to 
help her!”</p><p>“Lady Usagi…” Luna started.</p><p>“Artemis, you agree with me don’t 
you?”</p><p>The man held his shaking fists at his sides. It was obvious from his expression 
that he was torn by this predicament as well.</p><p>“But…What if she dies?!”</p><p>There was 
an awkward silence. The possibility had hovered over the adults’ minds for some time now, 
but none had dared to say it. Their Queen was strong, but even a Goddess could die from 
injury.</p><p>“She will not fight alone.”</p><p>Usagi blinked. Did she hear right? 
“Setsuna...?”</p><p>“What?” Luna demanded. “Setsuna, surely you cannot be serious! You heard 
Her Majesty’s orders. We are to guard Princess Usagi until her Highness returns!”</p><p>But 
the tall woman would hear none of it. She ignored Luna’s protests and left the Audience 
Chamber, leaving the furious, dark-haired woman behind her in silent, dangerous 
rage.</p><p>“Why that--”</p><p>“Calm down, Luna! Let her go.” Artemis shook his head and 
gripped her arm. Their eyes met and he saw past the anger to the disappointment in her blue 
eyes. Gently, he gripped her shoulders and gave them a comforting squeeze. “I know you want 
to go fight, and I do too…but we’re both needed here to protect—Usagi?!”</p><p>The woman ran 
past her distracted guardians and bolted out of the chamber after Setsuna. Both Luna and 
Artemis stared in shock as the large doors closed behind the woman’s disappearing form, 
leaving them alone in the room. They were both gaping in shock. Usagi had never disobeyed 
their instructions before.</p><p>“Usagi!” Luna shouted once she regained her voice. “That 
girl!”</p><p><u>(Outer Corridor)</u></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Screams 
reached Usagi’s ears, bringing her already racing heart to pound harder within her heaving 
chest. She desperately tried not to trip over her long dress, finding herself riddled with 
confusion and visions of her previous dream. The flash of images came again, but this time 
she could clearly make out the screams.</p><p><i>It’s just like in my dream! </i>Why had she 
simply dismissed the entire thing to be merely a figment of her imagination? Was this the 
price to pay for her foolishness?</p><p>A heavy, foul scent drifted into her direction and 
forced her to gasp back in pure shock and disgust. <i>That smell—! </i>She had never smelled 
anything quite so potent in her life.</p><p><i>I must be getting closer!</i></p><p><b>Tup! 
Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p><b>“</b><b>Usagi!”</b></p><p>The Princess came across a 
brightly-lit corridor. She flew down it, somehow knowing exactly where it would lead, and 
came stumbling out into an open terrace. The screams were still growing but now she knew 
why.</p><p>“W-What is this?!” <i>The Kingdom... Everything is falling apart. It’s all rising 
up to the sky! </i>She stared up at the clockwise, rotating warped space in the sky that 
seemed to swallow everything.</p><p>“This can’t be happening...” Saying that she was 
horrified was an understatement. <i>My mother is down there! </i>“I have to help 
her!”</p><p>Usagi threw out a thread of her aura and began to search the grounds as she had 
practiced during her lessons. From there she immediately sensed two enormous energies 
close-by. Following her instincts, she sought them out with the invisible trail in hopes 
that she would reach them in time.</p><p>When the young woman neared the gardens an 
explosion rang out and a combination of wind and dust kicked up in her 
face.</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i></p><p><i><b>FWOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOOOOOOSHHHH!!!</b></i></p><p>“AHHHH---!” 
A blinding light flew into her vision. Her movements were slowed, yet she didn’t dare to 
stop. A force was beckoning her forward.</p><p>Stubbornly, with her arms covering over her 
eyes, she inched nearer to the colliding forces. Until…</p><p>“Mother?!” She could make out 
the woman now. Her blue eyes instantly darted to where the other individual within the 
vicinity stood. Usagi gasped. “H-Hotaru?! You’re home?!”</p><p><i>I-It’s really her! It’s 
Hotaru! </i>Usagi always imagined herself ready to embrace her sister when she would return 
but the under these circumstances---! <i>But, what is she doing? Why is she fighting our 
mother?!</i></p><p>Usagi couldn’t decide how she should react to all of this. It was all 
happening too fast.</p><p>“What’s going on here...?” She felt like she was about to 
cry.</p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p>“Stay back!” Serenity shouted to her 
daughter.</p><p><i>No-!</i> Usagi’s eyes widened. The images within her mind came to a halt 
in this specific progression of events. She suddenly knew what was supposed to happen next. 
<i>It can’t be…</i></p><p><i><b>Lubb 
Dubb!</b></i></p><p>“NOOOOOOOOO!”</p><p><i><b>KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASH!</b></p><p>Usagi 
fell sobbing onto her knees, finding it difficult to see through her tears. She was in the 
garden again, very alone and aware.</p><p><i>I remember. I remember everything now, but... I 
wish I didn’t! It’s so terrible. Why...? </i>She was left amongst the ruins, amongst the 
shimmering lights, with memories of the dead. Her purpose in life was suddenly lost on her. 
Duty plagued her with guilt. Deep inside, the one she blamed was herself. She saw it all 
happen and did nothing but standby and watched it happen. Now, she was afraid of leaving 
this place, of taking another step forward. She only wished that the pain would go 
away.</p><p>“Someone…”</p><p><b>“</b><b>Usagi… wake up.”</b></p><p><i>That voice! </i>It cut 
through the dark and connected with her grief filled mind. Was someone calling her? Blue 
eyes blinked, and more tears rolled down her cheeks. <i>I’ve heard it somewhere 
before…</i></p><p>“What do you mean?” She questioned. “What do you mean by wake up...? I’m 
already awake, aren’t I?”</p><p>A thread of reddish-purple aura dropped down from the 
darkness above and held steady in the space directly in front of her.</p><p><b>“</b><b>You 
need to wake up from the dream… Awaken Usagi… Awaken…” </b>The voice echoed.<b> “Break the 
cycle. Stop re-living this nightmare…”</b></p><p>Usagi hesitantly peered at the thread. The 
power was familiar, but different somehow. Did she dare to hope?</p><p><i>Stop re-living 
this nightmare? Are you saying...that this just another dream? Am I just 
dreaming?</i></p><p>“...I’m afraid.” <i>If I touch that light, what will happen to me? Will 
I... disappear?</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>We…need… your… help.”</b></p><p>An image of Hotaru 
standing amongst the Moon Kingdom’s ruins was projected before her. Something was happening. 
Usagi tried to peer closer. There was a raven-haired stranger that was struggling—why was 
she struggling?</p><p><i>Who is that? And what’s she doing? Is that a barrier? </i>She 
pulled back, momentarily confused. <i>What is this? This isn’t the future, is it...? Wait. 
The future...? </i>The thought struck her as odd. She thought back to what the voice just 
said. <i>That voice...they said that this was all a nightmare. Then, that means, this isn’t 
real, is it? </i></p><p>She remembered back to her interlude in the garden, how it all had 
felt corrupted and oppressive. Its beauty was like an illusion but the pain was still very 
real.</p><p><i>That’s right... today, was the day that my home was... I’ve just been living 
through the motions, haven’t I? </i>She had no idea of how many times she watched her home 
being destroyed, but it did explain some things.</p><p><i>I see. So...I’ve been alone this 
entire time. </i>Tears threatened to well up in her blue eyes once more, but she did not 
dare cry. <i>No, I can’t cry now. Because, Luna and Artemis... and Mother... wherever they 
are now, I’m sure that they would be sad too if I cried. It’s just—I’m so sorry...! 
Everyone! Please forgive me!</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>Usagi!”</b></p><p>Without hesitation now, 
Usagi reached forward and grasped the glowing thread. Instantly her world was engulfed by 
its light.</p><p><b>FLAAAAAASH!</b></p><p><u>(Moon Kingdom, 
Rei)</u></p><p><b>Rmm…Rmm…Rmm…<br></b><i><b>Crumble!</b></i></p><p>Rei nearly lost her 
balance when a part of the ground beneath her was beginning to give way. Hotaru’s spiritual 
pressure, which was leaking through the barrier at alarming proportions, was tearing up the 
ground. Was the girl who had destroyed an entire kingdom going to destroy its ruins as 
well?</p><p>“Erg...!!!”</p><p>The Martian tried to maintain her balance as the crater 
beneath her widened. She was painfully aware of the disintegrating gray surface, her only 
support, vanishing all around her. She heard it crack and split, saw it shatter into smaller 
miniscule particles before being heaved up into the air altogether. One pebble, in 
particular, broke right beside the Martian’s ear, tempting her dreadfully to abandon her 
dangerous task.</p><p><i>It’s getting worse! I-I don’t think I can hold her back for much 
longer!</i></p><p>Rei gritted her teeth and clenched her jaw. She felt her hold beginning to 
slip.</p><p><b>Crack—<br>Wooosh!</b></p><p>A fissure ran up one side of the barrier. In 
direct response the wind kicked up around the Martian and the barrier’s light 
flickered.</p><p><i>Grr...Damn it! </i>Rei pushed herself harder for more energy but her 
power was nearly depleted. The cracks along the barrier wall were spreading. <i>If this 
keeps up...I’ll have to resort to 
that!</i></p><p><b>Crack---<br>Crackle---<br>Tch---shhck----!</b></p><p><i>I’ve got no 
choice. </i>A golden light began to rise up around the Martian’s body. Rei felt her knees 
become temporarily weak, but the sensation was quickly swept away by a flood of power. 
Digging her back foot in, Rei mentally shot a blast of energy into the spell. “Hah!” Its 
effect was instantaneous; the pressure around the barrier was so strong that it didn’t just 
support the current guard, but compressed downwards with an iron grip. Even Hotaru had to 
arch an eyebrow at this display. But the young girl was not perturbed and Rei was no longer 
in the proper mental state to ponder why. For a minute, the two stared the other down like 
two animals battling for dominance.</p><p>Hotaru then stepped forward and placed both of her 
hands directly onto the barrier’s energy. Rei suddenly felt a yank on her power; Hotaru’s 
smile widened. There was an infuriating moment when Hotaru’s spiritual energy began to 
skyrocket further. It was expanding faster than Rei could compensate for it. With meticulous 
precision, her captive pressed one of her hands into a certain spot from within the barrier. 
The layer of energy began to slip away until her hand had slipped just outside. Amethyst 
eyes widened in that split second when a bolt purple lightning made a direct attack on 
her.</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“ARGH!” Rei was thrown back and her connection with 
the barrier snapped. The barrier instantly broke apart with a deafening 
explosion.</p><p><b>Crackle!<br>Fwoooooooooooooosh!</b></p><p><i>NO!</i></p><p>Rei staggered 
to sit up, but her entire system was suffering from shock. She winced when she felt a pain 
growing in her legs. <i>Ow! Geh...shit! I’m all out of power! My entire body is cramping 
up—Ah!</i></p><p>“Ho...taru.”</p><p><b>Tup. Tup.</b></p><p>A pair of glowing red eyes 
awakened and had its sights trained on her. The dangerous youth made a quick flick of the 
wrist and a glaive materialized in her small hand. The whispered words of ‘Silence Glaive’ 
reached Rei’s ears, but it mattered not to the soldier; it was a weapon, a very powerful 
weapon, and that was all she needed to know. Its blade was just as quickly pointed in her 
direction.</p><p><i>Right about now… it wouldn’t be bad to hear an ‘Auntie Rei’. </i>She 
mentally noted.</p><p><b>DOOOOOOM</b></p><p><u>(Audience Chamber, Setsuna)</u></p><p>Setsuna 
felt the tug from the other end of her mental thread. Opening her eyes, her tired crimson 
shone with relief and determination. Now was the time. The woman lifted her garnet staff 
into the air and aimed its pointed end towards the sheets of ice.</p><p>“Awaken Usagi!” She 
cried out and with all the strength she could muster, she thrust the end into the center of 
the icy seal and broke it.</p><p><i><b>Kablam!<br>SsssSsssssSSSSssss…</b></i></p><p>Upon 
contact of the two mediums an icy mist flew up throughout the room, clouding the atmosphere 
with its cool presence. From its source another two rays of light shot to either side of the 
room. One revealed the form of a sleeping, white cat, while the other returned its black 
counterpart. Setsuna regarded her companion’s forms with a calm expression, before, more 
nervously, she allowed herself to look upon their Princess.</p><p>Through the dissipating 
dust, Setsuna could see Usagi’s blue eyes finally opening for the first time in centuries. 
The golden-haired woman involuntarily gasped for breath and coughed at first, but that was 
to be expected. Setsuna knew that her body was re-adjusting to the atmosphere.</p><p>“Lady 
Usagi.”</p><p>“Setsuna...?” Usagi’s voice was barely higher than a whisper. The last piece 
of her memory was returning to her as the final effects of the spell lost its influence over 
her.</p><p>“<i>Setsuna, what? Lady Usagi!!” Luna’s voice rang out.</i></p><p>“<i>She is 
alive, but I am afraid that Lady Hotaru is no more.”</i></p><p>“<i>So, then it was Lady 
Hotaru.” Artemis muttered wearily. “Damn it! How did it ever come to 
this?!”</i></p><p>“<i>We can’t help it. What’s done is 
done.”</i></p><p>“<i>...Luna.”</i></p><p>“<i>Setsuna, what shall we do now? Has Her Majesty 
returned yet…?”</i></p><p>“<i>I’m afraid...she is also no more… She perished in battle with 
Lady Hotaru.”</i></p><p><i>Setsuna struggled to maintain her calm composure as her comrades 
came to grip with the news. </i></p><p>“<i>No...! No! It can’t be true!”</i></p><p>“<i>We 
must seal Lady Usagi away.” Setsuna finally said. “Undoubtedly, the tragedy that occurred 
today was of Apollo’s doing. If he should find out that Lady Usagi is still alive, he will 
surely seek her out.”</i></p><p>“<i>You mean to put her to sleep.” Luna caught on. “But for 
how long? As long as she is asleep, she will be completely vulnerable. Did you even consider 
that?”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes, I am well aware of the fact. That is precisely why I will need 
your cooperation in this matter. Luna. Artemis. Will you both continue to guard her as you 
would have done?”</i></p><p>“…<i>Yes. You have my word.” Artemis solemnly 
nodded.</i></p><p>“<i>But what about you?” Luna suspiciously asked.</i></p><p>“<i>I will 
monitor the situation from the outside.”</i></p><p>“<i>All by 
yourself...?”</i></p><p>“<i>Until the time comes… please, keep her safe. That is all that I 
ask.”</i></p><p><b>Tup. Tup. Tup.</b></p><p>Usagi silently walked past her Mother’s former 
advisor. There was a new emotion in her blue eyes now: Determination.</p><p><i>I can sense 
her...Hotaru. </i></p><p><b>Tup. Tup.</b></p><p><i>It’s just like the last time. </i>Up 
ahead she could see the purple aura seeping into the corridors before 
her.<br><i><br></i>“Lady Usagi...” Setsuna breathed.</p><p>“Please, take care of them.” She 
shot her a weak smile that rendered her guardian both speechless and immobile.</p><p><i>I-I 
can’t move! </i>The green-haired woman had no power left to counteract her Princess’s spell; 
it was futile.</p><p>Usagi never turned to look back as she proceeded down the hallway 
towards the entrance. There was only one goal in her mind now.</p><p><i>Wait for me, 
Hotaru…I’m coming for you.</i></p><p><u>(Moon Palace Garden Ruins, 
Rei)</u></p><p><i><b>Shink</b></i></p><p>Rei felt the curved blade touch against her chin. 
It wasn’t even a fight. The Martian watched as the small girl drew the weapon back and posed 
with a frightening smug smile on her lips. The little snot was actually enjoying 
this.</p><p><i>Is this it? Am I going to…?</i> Unconsciously she could hear Minako’s voice 
pleading with her not to die. Although their link was forced to end due to the severity of 
the situation, Rei almost wished that she hadn’t done it.</p><p><i>Minako… 
I’m---</i></p><p>“Stop!”</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>Hotaru was forced into a 
premature retreat when a white bolt of power forced the girl back. The two combatants turned 
their dark eyes towards the palace entrance in time to see a familiar figure descending the 
steps towards them with perfect grace.</p><p>Amethyst eyes looked upon her 
‘saviour’.</p><p><i>That dress… her hair and that face, I remember now! She was in the 
vision! But...I thought she was killed in that accident! Why is she 
here?!</i></p><p>“Hotaru, please stop this!” Usagi appealed once again. This time, she was 
not crying or trembling. Against this mighty power she stood tall and held her head high. It 
was as though she was the splitting image of their mother. But inside, Usagi’s heart was 
still that of a young girl’s. The magnitude of their situation was a heavy burden upon her 
shoulders.</p><p>She would meet it.</p><p>Hotaru cocked her head towards the newcomer with, 
at first, eyes of indifference. The dark-haired youth then slowly turned around to face the 
one who challenged her authority and interrupt her fun. That was odd. The face was somehow 
familiar; the tiny thought of coherency pricked at the back of the woman’s mind, however she 
decided to pay it no attention. It was all fun and games now. What her body craved for was 
destruction. She lusted for power and this person, this blue-eyed individual who dared to 
confront her, had it.</p><p>It piqued her interest.</p><p>The Silence Glaive now found a new 
worthy opponent. She stepped over Rei’s battered body, ignoring the half-dead woman as she 
would a grain of sand in the desert, and offered up her own challenging response to her 
opponent. She lifted her weapon and turned its blade towards Usagi’s direction, now pointing 
at the woman’s slender throat. That would be her target, she silently declared.</p><p>The 
action perturbed her sister somewhat. It was just like her dream.</p><p>“Will you not change 
your mind? Don’t you recognize me at all, Hotaru? It’s me, Usagi!”</p><p>But Hotaru wouldn’t 
budge from her position.</p><p>Unblinkingly, Usagi lowered her gaze slightly and brought her 
hands up to her chest. Hotaru narrowed her eyes in suspicion towards the 
action.</p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p><i>If you won’t stop...then I suppose, I have no 
choice…</i></p><p>A spark of light ignited within Usagi’s palms. If one stood within a few 
meters of the young woman, they would have seen the transparent, spherical object emerge 
from her chest and into her waiting hands.</p><p><i>What is that? Where is that light coming 
from?! </i>Rei struggled to get a better look. Her vision was blurry but she could still 
make out the transparent sphere gaining solidity in the stranger’s palms. As soon as it came 
into contact with the white aura, the power was amplified. Warm waves washed over the area 
and collided with the contrasting, dark energy of its opponent before the battle had 
officially begun. The ground began to tremble once again.</p><p>As this display progressed, 
a possibility dawned upon the Martian. The way the object glimmered, it reminded her of 
something that she had seen back on Saturn.</p><p><i>That thing in her hands... Could it be 
a heart crystal?!</i></p><p>“I’m sorry Hotaru. Please, forgive me...” Usagi whispered, her 
blue eyes welling with emotion. <i>If only there was another way.</i></p><p>Hotaru felt a 
sharp impulse flash through her as Usagi’s heart crystal charged up. For a second, did she 
actually feel threatened? The darkness within her flared up defensively against the light as 
if it were the nefarious villain. She had to destroy it. She had to crush all that stood in 
her way.</p><p>Hotaru raised her Silence Glaive and summoned up a powerful spell.</p><p>Rei 
helplessly watched as the two women, surrounding by contrasting auras, simultaneously 
released their 
powers.</p><p>“HAAAAAAAH!”</p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p><b>FWOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOOOOOOSHHHH!!!</b></p><p>The 
two powers collided with a mighty backlash of wind. Usagi had unleashed a stream of white 
energy, while Hotaru was counteracting with a stream of negative energy. Everything in the 
area trembled in the presence of these two enormous, but nearly equal forces.</p><p>Rei 
braced herself along the ground, finding herself grateful she was already there. Unknown to 
her, Setsuna was mimicking the very action within the palace structure.</p><p>“Nng--!!” 
Usagi struggled to keep her arms up. The wind was crashing down all around her, but the 
strain on her heart was greater. It was the first time that she entered real 
combat.</p><p><i>I mustn’t give up. My friends are counting on me! </i>She told 
herself.</p><p>Hotaru on the other end also felt the burden. She had already extended much 
of her energy due Rei and Setsuna’s efforts. If she didn’t finish the battle soon, then she 
would go over her limit again. With her purpose instinctively known, she put everything she 
had into the attack.</p><p><b>FWOoOoOoOo---oOOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p>Usagi gasped, but did not 
falter. In turn the woman also increased her power despite the dangerous strain it had on 
her heart.</p><p><b>FWOOOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p><i>This is crazy! </i>Rei mentally shouted. 
<i>Where can they possible get this much power?! How can they fight like 
this--?!</i></p><p><i><b>crackle!</b></i></p><p>“?!” Her head shot up. Suddenly her mouth 
felt very dry. “The sky… it’s warping?”</p><p>A warped space had appeared in the sky 
overhead of the two combatants. <i>That thing... where have I seen it before? </i>She 
recalled the vision from Saturn. <i>But wait a second. Wasn’t it turning the other way 
before? Why is it showing up now? </i>She squinted up to see speckles forming in the shadow. 
<i>What is-- </i></p><p>Rei yelped when pieces of stone shot down from the sky. Instantly 
she was covered in clouds of dust. The sound of pounding dirt was all around her. The 
Martian Commander huddled herself together and braced her arms over her head. She tightly 
squeezed her eyes shut and waited for a stone to kill her, if she was lucky, or for the 
moment she would be buried beneath a pile of rubble. But for some reason it never came. Rei 
cautiously opened her eyes and gasped at what she saw.</p><p><i>The ruins! </i>She watched 
as the stones fell atop of one another and spun into place.<i> They’re---They’re re-building 
themselves?!</i></p><p><i><b>Tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk—<br>Tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk, tnk, 
tnk, tnk---</b></i></p><p>“Hotaru, please stop this!” Usagi screamed out. She was oblivious 
to her outside surroundings and was only focused on her sister. “If you don’t stop---We’ll 
both die!”</p><p><i>I can’t hold this up much longer! I’m reaching my limit! I don’t 
understand Hotaru...Why…? Why do we have to fight?</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>A bright 
light broke out beside Hotaru’s form. Another purple aura, but stronger, surrounded its 
chosen combatant. Everyone within the area now felt the new presence and fearfully 
anticipated its meaning.</p><p><i>That aura...! </i>Setsuna recognized it at 
once.</p><p>Hotaru’s body struggled angrily against the new restraint. She had been winning 
her duel. Who dared to interrupt?!</p><p>The young woman turned her head to glance around, 
yet didn’t dare to break her energy attack. With her focus now lessened on Usagi’s attack, 
involuntarily she gave the other woman time to push the dark energy back to the center 
between them once more.</p><p><b>“</b><b>You…” </b>A voice spoke out. Hotaru’s red eyes 
widened upon hearing this. For the first time since the duel had begun, they held fear in 
them.</p><p>“There’s...two Hotaru’s?” Usagi squinted against the light. <i>Am I seeing 
things?</i></p><p><b>“</b><b>Then what they said was true… I sped ahead when I felt our 
link.”</b> The apparition remarked sadly. <b>“…Myself… This destruction must end. That is 
enough!”</b></p><p>Hotaru’s lips trembled at the command. This was a familiarity that her 
instincts could not deny, and it brought tears to her eyes.</p><p><i><b>Plip, 
plip…</b></i></p><p><i>Is she crying? </i>Usagi thought, but only Hotaru herself knew 
why.</p><p>With a smile, Hotaru’s spirit reached out and embraced herself from 
behind.</p><p>“<b>I haven’t been fair to you… have I?”</b></p><p>At that exact moment they 
both pulled back on the attack and ceased the energy flow. The remaining particles of both 
combatants charged forward and met at the middle with one last gigantic 
explosion.</p><p><i><b>KABOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p>Light permeated throughout the 
area, washing over its audience and the structures in waves. Warmth fell across the land, 
only to leave behind the Moon Kingdom in its former glory.</p><p>When it was all over, Rei 
blinked back in confusion. Everything-- the palace and the Kingdom was completely rebuilt. 
It was as if nothing had every happened, as though the annihilation of this civilization had 
never occurred.</p><p><i>Could it be… that when their powers collided, they reversed that 
time? </i><i>Does that even makes sense?</i></p><p><b>Flop.</b></p><p>“Aww… screw it.” Rei 
moaned. She didn’t want to think anymore. After maintaining a link with Minako for over a 
distance of light-years, sapped her strength over a barrier that happened to break despite 
her best efforts, AND almost lost her life all in one day she just wanted to 
sleep.</p><p><i>So tired... </i>Rei yawned, then closed her eyes and was asleep in a blink 
of an eye. It was going to be some time before she would awaken again.</p><p>Further back at 
the palace entrance, Setsuna regarded the former ruins in wordless wonder.</p><p><i>The 
buildings have returned, but our citizens...</i></p><p>“I suppose... that’s the way it 
should be. The dead will remain dead.” She whispered with heavy regret. Nothing could bring 
them back. Bring <i>her </i>back.</p><p><i>...Shame on me... for allowing my hopes to be 
raised. </i>She thought she knew better by now.</p><p>“Hotaru!”</p><p>A quick movement 
caught the woman’s eye when Usagi rushed forward to meet Hotaru. There was a look of 
disbelief on the other girl’s face.</p><p>“Usagi...?”</p><p>Tears flew from Usagi’s face 
when she flung herself forward and tightly embraced the other girl. “I’ve missed you so 
much!” She cried into her chest.</p><p>Hotaru felt her heart waver upon hearing those words. 
She couldn’t believe it. <i>Am I dreaming again? </i>Hot tears were beginning to sting her 
eyes. Her arms were already moving before she could stop it.</p><p><i>...If I am...then I 
don’t ever want to stop.</i></p><p>“...Me too. I’ve missed you too!” she croaked out and 
tightly hugged her back.</p><p><i>So, they have retrieved her heart on time… </i>Setsuna 
confirmed with relief. At least someone had a happy ending. <i>Lady Hotaru has finally 
returned.</i></p><p><b>…</b><b>ping…</b></p><p>Without turning her head, the former advisor 
sensed two other familiar presences approach her. She knew them immediately.</p><p>“Luna. 
Artemis. It has been awhile.” The two guardians had transformed back into their human forms, 
and were once again awake and aware. No words needed to be said. Among the three comrades, 
there was a common sentiment.</p><p><i>However, I’m afraid that this battle… is not over 
yet.</i></p>
