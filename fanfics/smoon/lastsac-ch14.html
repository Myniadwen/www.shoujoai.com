----------------------------------------------------------------------

Setsuna didn&#39;t even flutter an eyelid.  &quot;I was wondering when someone 
would figure it out.  I knew Serenity shouldn&#39;t have given Haruka and 
Michiru their mothers&#39; necklaces.&quot;
 
&quot;Why did she have them?&quot;
 
&quot;She had Ten&#39;ousei&#39;s because Kazeko knew that Shousha and Koshu would 
forever blame our young princess for her mother&#39;s death and the necklace 
was safer with Serenity.  Only the princess can wear it, anyway.  As for 
Michiru . . . I took the necklace of Neptune away from Shousha after 
Kazeko died.  She couldn&#39;t . . . after Kazeko died, she couldn&#39;t handle 
being a Senshi.  She hasn&#39;t transformed since Haruka was born, did you 
know?  She didn&#39;t even know that I gave the necklace to Serenity for 
safe keeping.  The rest are with the current Senshi, waiting for the 
right time.&quot;
 
&quot;These necklaces, what are they for?&quot;
 
Setsuna looked up, one hand resting on the staff by her side.  &quot;They 
control the planets.  Every planet has a crystal to protect and control 
it, and those crystals are entrusted to the Sailor Senshi of each 
generation.  They are attuned to the Star Seeds inside every Senshi and 
help to focus their power.  Once they were one, part of the Star Seeds, 
but they had to be separated to protect the worlds of the Silver 
Millennium.&quot;
 
&quot;And you?&quot;
 
&quot;You know better than that, Ken&#39;nin-kun.  I do not dispense information 
like this so indiscriminately.  It&#39;s dangerous.&quot;
 
&quot;You have secrets from us, your favorite princes?  Setsuna-san, you&#39;re 
so cruel!&quot;
 
&quot;Secrets?  Everyone has secrets and most of them know how to keep them.  
What makes you think you can get mine out of me?&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin pouted, glancing at his brothers as they wiped fake tears out of 
their eyes.  &quot;I can&#39;t believe you would do this to us, Setsuna-san.&quot;
 
Setsuna, Sailor Pluto, touched her heart.  &quot;Fine, you win.  I put mine 
back, Ken&#39;nin-kun.  My power is far greater than my mother&#39;s ever was 
and I can see things she could only imagine.  But now I am now linked 
with my planet.  Her life is my life, and if I am hurt, her power 
suffers.  It is a dangerous thing, taking the crystals in.&quot;
 
Ken&#39;nin sat down across from Pluto, the emerald grasped firmly in his 
hand.  &quot;You didn&#39;t know, Setsuna-san.  You never thought they would 
attempt something like that for love.  They sacrificed their worlds and 
you can&#39;t understand why.&quot;
 
&quot;I couldn&#39;t,&quot; Setsuna corrected, one gloved finger raised.  &quot;I do now.  
Kazeko explained it to me.  But I still see nothing but destruction in 
the future.&quot;
 
&quot;And if they hadn&#39;t married?  What then?&quot;
 
Setsuna closed her eyes, one hand resting on the Garnet Orb.  &quot;I see 
sadness, death, destruction, but the crystals are shattered and Earth . 
. . gone?  How can Earth be gone?&quot;
 
&quot;Because Destiny needs Michiru-san and Haruka-kun together to protect 
the future, if not the present.  The crystals, how do you put them in?&quot;
 
Pluto touched the emerald Ken&#39;nin held while his little brothers 
watched.  &quot;When the time comes, Makoto, Ami, Minako, Rei, Michiru, and 
Haruka will know.  They must bind themselves to their planets for the 
sake of the future and destiny.  Just tell them that.&quot;
 
&quot;The end is coming, isn&#39;t it?  Mako-chan will never be queen, will she?&quot;
 
Pluto touched Saiki&#39;s arm and smiled.  &quot;That&#39;s her destiny and one day 
it will come true.  Just believe in the Senshi when the final battle 
comes, and your love for your sister will save her.  Go home now, before 
we all get in trouble.&quot;
 
Alone once more, Pluto covered her heart and concentrated on the future.  
In her mind, against the green background of Earth, she saw Makoto, Rei, 
Minako, Ami, Haruka, Michiru, and young princess Serenity as Humans, 
happy and free to love as they would.  Haruka took Michiru&#39;s hand, and 
there was no one to stop her, to tell them that they could not be 
together, could not love each other.  In the distance, hidden by the 
veil of dreams, a tall, silver-haired man with a golden horn in the 
center of his forehead smiled, purple eyes watching his princess.
 
Pluto&#39;s eyes shot open.  Who was that?
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Father!  I&#39;m home.&quot;
 
&quot;Ami-chan!&quot;  Two children, a boy and a girl that looked remarkably 
identical, jumped into Ami&#39;s arms, pale blue hair and sapphire eyes 
marking them as her siblings.
 
&quot;Twins,&quot; Michiru explained.  &quot;Amami had Ami and these two, Hakuchou and 
Kaichou.  They don&#39;t remember their mother, but they know their sister.  
They&#39;re still innocent little children, not even old enough to 
understand the role they will play as siblings of the next Queen of 
Suisei.&quot;
 
&quot;How did Amami die?  Nobody told me.&quot;
 
&quot;To the rest of the Silver Millennium, she died of an incurable wasting 
disease, but we of the noble houses know the real story.  She loved 
Meika more than she could tell her, and Meika went to see her the day 
after she birthed the twins.  Meika already had all four of her children 
by then.  She saw the twins and realized that she and Amami were 
finished.  I guess Ami-chan, as the heir, was expected for the Queen of 
Suisei, but more children made Amami&#39;s marriage real to Meika.&quot;
 
&quot;She told her.  And Amami, weak after such a difficult birth, gave up.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah.  It&#39;s a really sad story and we don&#39;t talk about it much.  
Apparently, Meika returned to tell Amami how she really felt, but it was 
too late.  She died.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t remember.&quot;
 
&quot;Because Koshu didn&#39;t come.&quot;  Ami carried her siblings over to Haruka 
and handed the girl to the other princess.  &quot;Your father still hadn&#39;t 
gotten over his wife&#39;s death and he wasn&#39;t ready for my mother to pass 
on.  This one is Hakuchou, and her little brother is Kaichou.  Kids, 
this is Haruka-kun, and you remember Michiru-san.&quot;
 
&quot;And Mako-chan,&quot; Haku squealed.  She jumped out of Haruka&#39;s arms and ran 
over to Makoto, who scooped the girl up.
 
&quot;Hello, Haku-chan.  Have you been a good girl?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes!  Where&#39;s my present?&quot;
 
Makoto reached into her pocket and pulled out a tiny wooden figure, a 
swan painted white.  &quot;Right here.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh!  Utsukushii!  Is it really mine?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  Go show it to your father, okay?&quot;
 
The twins ran off, and Makoto pulled Ami into her arms.  &quot;I keep 
forgetting that your mother is dead.  I&#39;m sorry.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Mako-chan.  Come on; let&#39;s move your stuff into my room.&quot;
 
&quot;Won&#39;t your father object?&quot;
 
&quot;Normally, yes, but some of my family is visiting and we only have one 
guest room left.  I also have an extra bed in my room for you, so 
Haruka-kun and Michiru-san can take the guest room until they want to 
return to Kaiousei.&quot;
 
Haruka watched the pair depart, hands clenching into fists.  &quot;Why?  
Why?&quot;
 
&quot;Why what, Haruka?&quot;  For once, Michiru couldn&#39;t understand what was 
bothering her lover.
 
&quot;Why don&#39;t I have any siblings?&quot;
 
Michiru stared at Haruka, lost in her distant green eyes.  &quot;Kyoudai?  
Why?  I don&#39;t have any siblings, either.&quot;
 
&quot;You did, Michiru.  You had a brother, but Shousha lost him.  
Setsuna-san had two brothers; your mother has a sister; Ami-chan, 
Mako-chan, Rei-chan, and Minako-chan all have siblings; but I don&#39;t.  
And never did.&quot;
 
&quot;Serenity-san, your koneko-chan, doesn&#39;t either.&quot;
 
&quot;The Moon Princess never does.  The Mystical Silver Crystal sees to 
that.  But Uranus has no such restrictions.  Why, then, am I an only 
child?&quot;
 
&quot;Maybe because of our mothers.  Maybe, for some reason, Destiny needed a 
union between Uranus and Neptune that our mothers would not provide.  So 
she made sure that we would.  She made sure that we would meet, fall in 
love, and run away together.&quot;
 
&quot;But why?  Michiru, what are we supposed to do?&quot;
 
Michiru touched her necklace and smiled.  &quot;We&#39;ll figure it out.  Ami-san 
and Makoto-san probably need help, and there might be a feast later.  
Let&#39;s go, love.&quot;
 
As she followed her lover, Haruka wondered where Pluto was.  More 
importantly, what was Setsuna doing?
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna waited, Time Key held in front of her.  In the flower-studded 
garden, grass waving in a gentle breeze, a rip appeared in the fabric 
separating the real world from that of dreams.  The tall priest she had 
seen in her vision stepped into the garden, brushing his hair out of his 
face.  &quot;Yes, Setsuna-san?&quot;
 
&quot;You know who I am.&quot;
 
&quot;Of course.  I&#39;ve known you since I was born.  You came here to ask me 
where I come from, who my parents are, and why my existence can keep the 
Earth from being destroyed and the Sailor Senshi from vanishing into the 
winds of time, space, and reality forever.  Also, you want to prevent 
the coming apocalypse.&quot;
 
Pluto shrugged.  &quot;Good guess.&quot;
 
The priest sighed and hung his head, golden horn shining in the 
sunlight.  &quot;I guard the Golden Crystal that keeps the Earth alive.  In 
one premonition that you had, my parents never gave birth to me and the 
Golden Crystal never gained a protector.  Earth died.  What you told 
Ken&#39;nin and his brothers, about the Senshi needing to take their 
crystals into themselves to preserve their souls for the future, was 
true.  This Solar System needs its Senshi.  I came from the future, but 
I cannot name my parents, nor have I ever met them.  I may before the 
end of this time or during the next, but I don&#39;t need to know them.  
They risked everything for me, and I know that they loved me and always 
will.  That&#39;s all that really matters, and I can tell you no more.&quot;
 
Pluto looked into her Garnet Orb, remembering her vision.  &quot;What about 
your name?&quot;
 
&quot;Helios, sometimes Pegasus.  My spirit is a winged unicorn that children 
see in their dreams, which I guard.  I only reveal my true shape to the 
rulers of Earth, though.&quot;
 
&quot;Then why me?&quot;
 
&quot;Because you brought me here in the past and gave me this purpose.  The 
true Guardians of Earth are incapable of separating themselves from the 
planet, as you are incapable of loosing the hold of Meiousei.  They do 
not know, so I must be here.  Young Prince Endymion carries the Star 
Seed of Earth and I insure that he will fulfill his destiny one day, one 
life.  I will see you again, Meiou Setsuna, Sailor Pluto.  You must not 
worry about the end; there is no end that does not lead to a new 
beginning.  Remember that, and never lose hope.&quot;  Helios bowed and 
vanished, the image of a winged unicorn flashing into Setsuna&#39;s head.  
Closing her eyes, the Queen of Pluto returned home, the priest&#39;s final 
words echoing in her head.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;I&#39;m really not ready for this.&quot;
 
Michiru chuckled, laying one hand on Haruka&#39;s arm.  &quot;My mother will be 
happy to see you, Urakaze Haruka.&quot;
 
&quot;But she won&#39;t be expecting Ten&#39;ou Haruka.  No matter what I said when 
we left Kaiousei, I am afraid of your mother.  She can do more to us 
than just send me away.  She will find out, sooner or later.  And what 
if my father comes to your party?  Certainly he will recognize me.&quot;
 
&quot;Your father declined the invitation.  He knows how our mothers felt 
about each other, and he cannot stand to see Kazeko&#39;s lover.  Your 
father won&#39;t see you.  But if Serenity-san could discover your true 
identity, others can, too.  You&#39;re not safe, Haruka.  My mother will 
know, soon.&quot;
 
Haruka curled her fingers around her henshin stick and wrapped her arm 
around Michiru&#39;s waist.  &quot;Let me handle your mother.  Kazeko remembers 
Shousha&#39;s temperament.  Let&#39;s go now.&quot;
 
Makoto and Ami watched from the door, smiling as their friends vanished.  
&quot;I hope they find happiness together.&quot;
 
&quot;I think they will, Mako-chan.  I really think they will.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka placed the Aqua Mirror and Neptune&#39;s henshin stick on the stand 
in the small room beside Michiru&#39;s mother&#39;s bedroom, easily slipping out 
the window and scaling the castle wall to Michiru&#39;s bedroom, one floor 
above Queen Shousha&#39;s, where her lover was waiting.  &quot;All done.  From 
what I hear from the servants, I&#39;m guessing that she never even noticed 
that they were gone.&quot;
 
&quot;Good.  I&#39;ve sent for Mother, to tell her that we&#39;ve returned from our 
wedding.  I really hope she hasn&#39;t been speaking to Queen Serenity 
recently.&quot;
 
Haruka chuckled, leaning against the wall, arms crossed over her chest, 
covering the necklace that Serenity had given her.  &quot;They haven&#39;t spoken 
since Kazeko&#39;s death.  Apparently they didn&#39;t even speak at Serenity&#39;s 
birthday party, where I first saw you.  By the way, whatever happened to 
Kiyoshi-kun?  I didn&#39;t see him the entire time we were on Suisei.&quot;
 
&quot;He went home earlier today.  He said that he&#39;d be here for my party, 
but he wants to gather some things or pray or something before then.&quot;
 
&quot;As long as he comes.&quot;
 
Shousha chose that moment to make her entrance, smiling at the pair.  
&quot;Welcome home, my young heirs.  How was your trip?&quot;
 
&quot;Enlightening,&quot; Haruka replied.  &quot;We saw all of the Inner Princesses.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s nice.  Who married you?&quot;
 
&quot;A priest friend of mine from Uranus.  He&#39;ll be here for the party to 
announce our wedding.&quot;
 
&quot;Do I know him?&quot;
 
&quot;Probably not.  He&#39;s Oshou of the Ten&#39;ou no Utsukushii Uta Temple, 
Yoruno Kiyoshi of the Order of the Winds of Ten&#39;ousei.  Do you know 
him?&quot;
 
&quot;No, I really don&#39;t, though that temple seems vaguely familiar.  Well, 
I&#39;ll meet him soon.  Oh, I meant to ask you; would you like to add any 
of your friends to the guest list?  You&#39;re back early, so there&#39;s still 
time.&quot;
 
&quot;I want to invite the four Inner Royal Families and Queen Meiou Setsuna, 
if she&#39;ll come.&quot;
 
&quot;The children, too?&quot;
 
&quot;They&#39;re very sweet, and I wouldn&#39;t want to leave them out.  They may 
never be queens, but they will have important jobs when their sisters 
take the thrones and they should all meet their future partners.&quot;
 
Shousha shrugged.  &quot;Very well.  Why don&#39;t the two of you go on a picnic 
or something until the guests begin to arrive tomorrow?  I&#39;ll be busy 
until then.  Oh, why don&#39;t you want to invite your king?&quot;
 
&quot;Ten&#39;ou-sama is still involved in the search for his daughter and Space 
Sword.  It&#39;s better if we not remind him of the happiness of the 
Kaiousei kingdom.  Unless you would like to invite him, Shousha-sama.&quot;
 
&quot;No, I don&#39;t.  And don&#39;t be so formal with me, Haruka-kun.  I&#39;m your 
mother now.&quot;
 
Haruka bowed, keeping her arms crossed, a brief smile crossing her face.  
&quot;Very well.  I look forward to seeing you again, Shousha-san.&quot;
 
Michiru&#39;s mother left and Haruka unfolded her arms, looking at the topaz 
Serenity had given her.  &quot;What are these necklaces, Michiru?  Why are 
they so important?&quot;
 
&#39;Why do you think, my daughter?  That stone holds your control over your 
planet, your link to Ten&#39;ousei.  Once they were part of the True Star 
Seeds that make us Senshi, but they&#39;re separate now to protect the 
queens.&#39;
 
Haruka looked at Michiru.  &quot;Did you hear?&quot;  Michiru nodded.  &quot;I guess 
they are important.  Oh, Mother, is there anything else we should know 
about these necklaces.&quot;
 
&#39;Only the Senshi can wear them.&#39;
 
&quot;Oh, dear.  Michiru, Mako-chan&#39;s brothers saw me wearing this.  They 
must know about these necklaces.  What if they figured it out?&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, my love.  I don&#39;t think they would tell anybody even if 
they knew.  And perhaps they never made the connection.  We don&#39;t have 
anything to worry about, Haruka.  Now, my mother did suggest a picnic, 
and I think that would be a great idea.&quot;</pre>
