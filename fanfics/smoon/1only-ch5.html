<h1>My One, My Only, My Eternity (part 5 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/1only-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&#39;Two weeks.&#39; &quot;And so you will be meeting with Endyimon.&quot;

&#39;She hasn&#39;t come back for me.&#39; &quot;With the terrain queen.&quot;

&#39;She promised she would.&#39; &quot;Serenity.&quot;

&#39;She promised.&#39; &quot;SERENITY!!!!&quot; Sere jumped slightly as the sharp voice 
of her guardian, Luna, pierced her gloomy thoughts. Glancing up, she 
watched as the cat closed her eyes, touching the talisman around her 
neck to change into her human form, looking down at Sere with bright 
blue eyes filled with concern. &quot;Serenity, you haven&#39;t been yourself 
for two weeks. You can not still be mooning over Galaxia-&quot; &quot;You don&#39;t 
understand Luna.&quot; Sere tried, looking up as the guardian stood up 
huffily to glare down at her. &quot;What I understand is that you, Princes 
of the moon, and future queen of Endyimon, are not only mooning over 
an exiled senshi who hasn&#39;t been seen or tracked for two weeks, but 
mooning over a WOMAN!!! Your mother.your COURT, would never accept it! 
It is an insult to your mother, to your kingdom!! You- &quot; &quot;Luna.&quot; The 
guardian jumped slightly, turning around as the dark sound of Sailor 
Uranus&#39;s voice broke thought the blue haired cat-girl&#39;s rant from 
where she leaned casually against the doorframe, the shorter princess 
of Neptune tucked comfortably against her lean frame. Luna flushed, 
looking back and forth between the two at the door and her princess 
before dashing out of the room. &quot;Michiru! Haruka!&quot; Sere cried, jumping 
to her feet to give the two a group hug. Haruka blushed, glancing down 
at Neptune as the other girl laughed and hugger her princess in 
return. &quot;Come princess.we have a surprise before the ball tonight.&quot; 
Michiru whispered, tugging a strand of light silver-blonde hair as the 
princess&#39; face darkened. &quot;You mean before I turn 18 and am officially 
shackled to that brute Endyimon?&quot; Serenity asked sarcastically. Haruka 
sighed and nodded while Neptune smiled mysteriously, taking hold of 
the princess&#39; hand. &quot;Just come with me.&quot;

Serenity&#39;s study.)

&quot;Beryl&#39;s forces are still being held back.but I don&#39;t know how long 
she will do it.&quot; Pluto spoke, pacing the study floor with a dark look 
on her face. &quot;She?&quot; Queen Serenity asked, raising an elegantly curved 
eyebrow. &quot;Galaxia my queen. She&#39;s put a field around the moon&#39;s 
orbital system. I honestly don&#39;t think she&#39;s planning to help 
forever.&quot; Pluto whispered, staring out the window. &quot;She will as long 
as Serenity is here.&quot; the queen whispered with a sudden insight. Dread 
filled her soul as she stood, staring at the senshi, &quot;But Serenity is 
being officially engaged to Endyimon tonight! S-she won&#39;t mean much 
after she&#39;s betrothed.the attack is tonight isn&#39;t it!!&quot; Pluto nodded, 
looking out at the beams of light hitting against an invisible field, 
gold flashing with ever hit of an attack. It had started again 
suddenly after two weeks of silence. &quot;Shall I alert the guards?&quot; Pluto 
asked quietly, looking over her shoulder. &quot;No. No!! The engagement was 
canceled two weeks ago because of that senshi! My daughter WILL marry 
Endyimon!!&quot; Queen serenity declared, vengeance in her tone. Pluto 
nodded, walking slowly out of the room, thinking the thought most had 
been thinking for the past while. &#39;My queen.you&#39;ve changed.for the 
worse.&#39;

Gardens.)

&quot;Michi.where are you taking me.?&quot; Sere laughed, fingering the 
blindfold around her eyes before her hand was gently pulled away by 
one of the outer senshi. To her limited knowledge, they&#39;d boarded a 
craftily made raft somewhere, presumably in the far garden pond, for 
how long they&#39;d been walking. She knew almost instantly as the raft 
hit up against something, the sound of pebbles churning under the 
bottom of the raft giving it away. It was confirmed as the blindfold 
was taken away to reveal the silver pebbles under the crystalline 
waters of the northern pond. Hope welled up in Serenity as she 
remembered that this had been the place Galaxia had always taken 
her.the unknown island in the center of the pond. &quot;Serenity.&quot; Azure 
eyes shot up, trying to see through the dense mist as a shrouded 
figure drew closer. Hope welled even further at the thought that it 
might just be the woman she&#39;d been missing for the last two weeks.the 
Mist fell away, taking all Serenity&#39;s thoughts with it. &quot;Senshi 
Saturn. Good to see you again.&quot;Haruka volunteered as Serenity tried to 
get over her disappointment. Finally looking up, Sere smiled, 
accepting the young senshi&#39;s embrace gleefully. &quot;Come with me 
Serenity.I have your birthday present ready. It is from your outer 
court.&quot; the young girl whispered mysteriously, stepping away to pull 
back the vines of the tree in the center of the small pond&#39;s island. A 
gasp was torn from Sere&#39;s lips as the shrouded form of Galaxia was 
seen leaning up against the tall pond tree. Gathering her courage 
against the sudden weakness that seemed to flood her body, she lifted 
her skirts, walking forward before dipping into a low curtsey for the 
golden senshi. To her embarrassment, the other woman started laughing, 
causing the tension to shatter around them, Haruka and Michiru joining 
in Galaxia&#39;s merriment as Saturn bowed her head, a slight quirk of her 
lips her only sign of amusement. &quot;No need to be so formal, dearest 
Serenity.&quot; Galaxia whispered, sobering as her princess gained a look 
as if she were about to cry. Smiling softly, the golden warrior dipped 
to one knee, taking Serenity&#39;s hand in her own to kiss the soft back 
of her hand. &quot;I&#39;m s-sorry, G-Galaxia.Where h-have you been?&quot; The other 
woman stood, holding up a softly glowing gold orb to show the 
astonished girl. &quot;I&#39;ve been protecting this. It lasts only a few more 
hours M&#39;Lady, long enough for you to turn 18.then the barrier will be 
shattered.and Beryl&#39;s forces will come for the kingdom.I want you to 
run with me. If you live.and they live.the moon kingdom can be 
revived. I need you to go back.get the Silver Crystal.then come back 
to me.&quot; Galaxia whispered pleadingly, taking the younger girl in her 
arms simply to be near her. Serenity nodded against the other woman&#39;s 
chest; hope returning to her once- deadened eyes. &quot;I&#39;ll be back soon.&quot; 
Serenity whispered, taking the warrior by surprise as she leaned up, 
tipping Galaxia&#39;s head down before covering her lips with her own, 
feeling as her soul entwined with the golden warrior&#39;s. Time seemed to 
stop for both women as Galaxia&#39;s arms drifted down to Serenity&#39;s 
waist, tracing a loving pattern on her pale back as Serenity&#39;s arms 
crept around the other woman&#39;s neck. Haruka and Michiru blushed, 
looking at each other before abruptly looking at their feet, Saturn 
giving them an odd now-you-know-how-I-feel look before staring boldly 
at the kissing couple, suddenly feeling right with the world. Galaxia 
broke the contact first, gasping for air as the tiny orb in her hand 
started clicking and rumbling, each attack hurting Galaxia more then 
she&#39;d ever let on. Serenity looked at the other woman lovingly, tears 
in her eyes as she almost felt the attacks against the golden barrier 
as her love did. &quot;I&#39;ll be back soon m&#39;love, so soon.&quot; the Princess 
whispered before dashing into the mist, followed closely by Uranus and 
Neptune as Saturn stepped up, her aura glowing powerfully as she 
started her ever-lasting work on healing Galaxia&#39;s internal wounds. 
&quot;Do you think Beryl will keep her promise and leave the Princess to 
you, when you let down that wall?&quot; Saturn asked, looking up at her 
dearest friend. &quot;She will.or I&#39;ll kill her myself.&quot;
