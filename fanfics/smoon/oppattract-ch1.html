<h1>Opposites Attract</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shamie.html">Shamie-Chan</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&#147;Rayeee&#133;&#148; Mina whined. She looked out the window, observing the pouring 
rain and then turned back to Raye pouting. &#147;I don&#146;t want to go home, 
I&#146;ll get sick if I walk in this weather!&#148;

Raye looked up from her homework and out the window and frowned. She 
closed her eyes, concentrating to see/feel any strange energy. Who 
knows, an enemy could cause the rains! She didn&#146;t feel anything 
suspicious and looked back up at Mina smiling. &#147;Why don&#146;t you stay the 
night, you can use my clothes&#133;&#148;

Mina clasped her hands together, &#147;Oh thank you! And thanks for the tips 
for my history class.&#148; She gave an annoyed moan and flopped down next to 
Raye again. &#147;I hate school.&#148;

Raye lifted an eyebrow. &#147;At least we only have a little bit of high 
school left. Three more months!&#148; At that both girls grinned but soon 
they were both working quietly on homework. Both were kind of startled 
when Raye&#146;s grandpa barged in with a tray of cookies and milk. Nothing&#146;s 
better than cookies and milk on a rainy day!&#148; He smiled at the two and 
made his leave.

&#147;Grandpa&#133;&#148; Raye shook her head. She turned to find Mina stuffing her 
face with cookies. &#147;Hey, leave some for me!&#148; Raye reached her had 
forward, accidentally causing Mina to spill milk down the front of her 
shirt. &#147;Oh I&#146;m so sorry!&#148; Raye apologized wide-eyed as she handed Mina a 
napkin.

&#147;It&#146;s okay, Raye-chan.&#148; Mina stood up and looked around and then 
remembered that she didn&#146;t pack a bag because she didn&#146;t plan to stay at 
Raye&#146;s house.

Raye walked over to her dresser and pulled out one of her miko outfits. 
&#147;It&#146;s really comfortable, and I&#146;ve always wondered what you and the 
other scouts would look like in them.&#148; She winked and handed it to Mina.

&#147;Yeah! Dress up! How fun!&#148; Mina quickly changed into the outfit and 
posed playfully. &#147;So? How do I look?&#148; She twirled and posed again.

&#147;Hmmm&#133;&#148; Raye tilted her head to the side and gave a thumbs up, &#147;Maybe if 
you acted more serious you&#146;d seem like a real miko.&#148; Mina pouted, 
&#147;You&#146;re so mean.&#148; Raye smiled innocently. Mina had to think of a way to 
get back. She looked around and noticed one of Raye&#146;s drawers slightly 
open so she stuck her hand in a pulled out the first cloth her hand came 
into contact with.

&#147;Well well well! What do we have&#133; GASP!&#148; Mina was now holding a red 
thong and was blushing. Raye&#146;s eyes got huge and she snatched it away, 
&#147;Hey! Who said you could get into my underwear drawer!?&#148; Mina started 
laughing hysterically. Raye started to get annoyed. &#147;What&#146;s so funny?&#148;

&#147;Oh Raye-chan, you were the last person I&#146;d expect to wear a thong! 
Especially under your miko outfit!&#148; Mina had tears in her eyes from 
laughing so hard. &#147;Mina-chan! Do you think I don&#146;t deserve to wear 
them?&#148; Raye feigned that her feeling were hurt and that shut up Mina 
quickly. &#147;Of course not!&#148; Mina straightened up and smiled at Raye.

Raye tried to remain serious but then she burst out, &#147;Well I saw your 
panties while you were dressing and those are much worse than MINE!&#148; She 
giggled and sat back on the floor, grabbing a cookie.

Mina stared blankly at Raye for a second then blushed slightly. She 
settled next to Raye. &#147;But mine are my favorite color&#133; orange.&#148; She said 
quietly while concentrating on a history question.

&#147;Nyah! Red&#146;s better!&#148; Raye stuck her tongue out at Mina. &#147;Nyah, orange 
is way better!&#148; Mina did the same and both girls started laughing again. 
Mina fell back on the floor and sighed, &#147;It&#146;s so weird we get along so 
well. In truth we&#146;re like, almost, polar-opposites.&#148;

Raye looked over at Mina thoughtfully, &#147;Well Mina-chan, have you ever 
head the saying &#145;opposites attract&#146;?&#148; Raye rolled around and lay next to 
Mina on her stomach with her chin resting in her hands.

&#147;Well, think about it. You&#146;re Sailor Mars, ruled by Mars, the Greek God 
of war. I&#146;m Sailor Venus, ruled by Venus, the Greek Goddess of love and 
beauty.&#148; Mina smiled proud of herself. &#147;See! You&#146;re teaching me well! 
I&#146;m getting better at history already!&#148; Both girls heard the wind hit 
the side of the house strong, the sound of rain was heard quite 
intensely now.

Raye smiled, &#147;Yeah, also, to add to that, Venus and Mars were lovers for 
a short time&#133;&#148; Mina sweatdropped. &#147;Really? But why?&#148; Raye looked down at 
her considerately, &#147;I already told you, I think opposites attract.&#148;

Mina sat up confused. &#147;Then were Neptune and Uranus lovers???&#148; She 
turned to Raye questioningly. &#147;Uhhhh&#133;&#148; Raye was stumped. &#147;No, I believe 
that they were grandfather and grandson.&#148;

Mina sweatdroped again, &#147;Eck!&#148; Raye sighed embarrassed. &#147;Come to think 
of it, I think Mars and Venus were half brother and sister!&#148; Mina doubly 
sweatdroped, &#147;WHAT?!&#148; Not knowing what to say Raye gave an excuse, 
&#147;We&#146;ll get to that part of the Greek God family tree later in your 
history studies.&#148; Mina wasn&#146;t listening and was staring blankly at a 
ceiling.

Deciding now was a definite moment to break the silence, Raye lunged 
forward and play tackled Mina. &#147;Oof! What was that for?!&#148; Her face was 
flushed. &#147;Never let your guard down, hasn&#146;t Artmis taught you anything 
&#145;V-babe&#146;?&#148; Raye grinned and sat up fixing her hair. Mina followed suite 
and adjusted her red bow.

Raye eyed the bow, &#147;I though your favorite color was orange?&#148;

&#147;It is!&#148; Stated Mina, then she paused and quickly stated, &#147;It was 
suggested I wear a red bow&#133; ugh&#133; long story.&#148; Mina&#146;s eyes suddenly took 
a little evil glitter. &#147;Raye-chan! Hold still!&#148; Mina crawled behind Raye 
and placed the bow in Raye&#146;s hair.

&#147;Hmmm, it doesn&#146;t do a &#145;beauty&#146; like you justice.&#148; Mina remarked as she 
handed Raye her hand mirror.

&#147;Urk, it looks funny on me.&#148; Both girls turned to each other and 
laughed. &#147;This is entertaining, you&#146;re wearing my miko outfit and I&#146;m 
wearing your bow!&#148; Raye tossed the bow back to Mina who placed it on 
Raye&#146;s counter. Mina started rummaging around the counter.

&#147;Hey Raye-chan?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148;

&#147;Do you have a brush I can use? My beautiful hair can&#146;t be unattended 
you know.&#148; Mina made a little pose right before Raye threw a pillow at 
her. &#147;Hey!&#148;

Raye stood up, &#147;Here,&#148; She pulled out a brush, &#147;let me do it.&#148; Mina 
nodded and sat on the floor. Raye sat behind her and started running the 
brush through her friends hair.

Raye blushed, which was caught by Mina who was watching through the 
mirror, &#147;What&#146;re you blushing for Raye-chan?&#148;

&#147;Oh, nothing. It&#146;s just I&#146;ve always been kind of jealous of yours and 
Bunny&#146;s hair.&#148; Raye smiled lightly and continued stroking through Mina 
long blond hair. Mina thought a moment, &#147;Well, I really don&#146;t think 
you&#146;d make a very good blond.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll take that as a compliment.&#148; Raye tilted Mina&#146;s head to a better 
angle and continued. Mina turned suddenly, her hair swirling to meet 
Raye&#146;s gaze. &#147;Do you think I&#146;m pretty?&#148; Mina&#146;s eyes were glistening and 
her heart pounding. She felt really close to Raye right now for some odd 
reason.

Raye smiled, &#147;Do I have any choice but to answer yes?&#148; Mina scanned 
Raye&#146;s features, checking for truth, found it, and was satisfied. &#147;Okay, 
I&#146;m ready for bed, it&#146;s getting late.&#148;

&#147;Hmmm&#133; what do you want to wear to bed?&#148; Raye was searching through her 
pajama drawer, she was only asking the question out of politeness, 
really, all she had for bed was some small tee-shirts and shorts. Mina 
looked over her shoulder and said, &#147;Actually, I like to sleep in my 
panties.&#148;

&#147;Me too.&#148; Answered Raye.

Both girls suddenly jumped, hearing distant thunder. Raye quickly 
regained her composure but Mina clung to Raye&#146;s arm. &#147;Eep!&#148; Her eyes 
were squinted shut. Raye made an ah-hem noise and woke Mina up. &#147;I&#146;m 
sorry Raye-chan. I have a slight fear of thunder and lightning.&#148; Raye&#146;s 
eyes softened, &#147;It&#146;s okay. Come on, let&#146;s lay a mat out for you.&#148;

After the mat had been set up and Mina&#146;s bedding situated, they could 
feel the storm get harder and closer. Mina didn&#146;t cling anymore, but she 
was obviously scared. Mina climber into bed and took off Raye&#146;s clothes 
and set them next to the mat. She snuggled in the blankets and willed 
away the storm.

Raye watched her worried and turned off the light. Her night vision was 
excellent, so she walked to her dresser and undressed. She had just put 
her panties on when a flash of lightning lit up the room, followed by a 
ground shaking &#147;BOOM.&#148; Mina squeaked and popped her head out of the 
covers looking for support, but instead she got a breathtaking view of 
the beautiful Raye, Sailor Mars.

Raye kneeled next to Mina&#146;s bed, &#147;Do you want to sleep with me? I won&#146;t 
mind, really.&#148; Mina pulled her covers up to her chin and whispered, &#147;No 
thank you.&#148;

&#147;Okay then,&#148; Raye answered worried. &#147;Goodnight Mina-chan.&#148;

&#147;Goodnight Raye-chan.&#148; Mina replied. She shut her eyes and tried to 
break away from the fear she felt. But every time thunder struck her 
heart would stop. She was becoming frantic.

When she was little, she always had a nightmare that was like this. The 
lightning would strike, the thunder would rattle and she would walk down 
a long hallway, filled with windows. And one of the flashes made the 
outline of a body, moving towards, then the thunder would break and 
she&#146;d scream and wake up.

Sure, while in battles when she was Sailor Venus, she wouldn&#146;t feel any 
fear. Fear was a weakness. But now she was Mina. She couldn&#146;t hide 
behind a secret identity, a secret power.

By now she was drenched in sweat and she pushed off her covers, but that 
made her feel vulnerable, so she pulled them back over her and clung to 
them.

Raye was watching Mina, very worried now. Why was she so scared? Why 
wouldn&#146;t she accept her help? What could she do to help? After about 
twenty minutes of tossing and turning Mina finally fell into a restless 
sleep. Raye pulled her covers off and crept next to Mina. She placed her 
hand over her forehead, feeling the sweat.

Raye made up her mind and stretched out next to her friend and enveloped 
her in her own arms. Sure, Sailor Venus was her leader in protecting the 
Princess, but right now, Raye would protect Mina from what ever was 
frightening her. So she pulled her covers over herself, leaned her head 
in the crook of Mina&#146;s neck and held her tight.

Mina felt the arms wrap around her, at first it frightened her, then she 
knew by Raye&#146;s perfume it was her. She blushed at her weakness, but 
didn&#146;t say anything and let herself fall into the moment. She wasn&#146;t as 
scared now. Thunder struck again and her body tightened and the arms 
around her held her closer.

Mina turned around so she could face Raye. Her face was soft and 
flawless, a light crack of lightning illuminated Raye and Mina blinked. 
Another boom of thunder sounded and Mina buried her head in Raye&#146;s 
chest. Raye&#146;s eyes flew open as she felt arms return her own grip and 
cradled Mina.

The rain started to come down in sheets, so loud both the girls opened 
their eyes only to see each other faces, inches from each other, in the 
once again flickering lightning. Mina leaned forward, closing the gap 
and placed her lips softly on Raye&#146;s. Raye&#146;s eyes were wide open, she 
was stunned.

&#147;Please Raye,&#148; Mina whispered when she broke from the kiss, &#147;Make it go 
away, make me forget&#133;&#148; She let the sentence trail off as Raye leaned 
forward, making this kiss hers. Mina mumbled something incoherent and 
then let the kiss flow through her. She could feel hers and Raye&#146;s hair 
combine in surrounding them.

Both girls held to each other, pulling to one another. Mina reached 
behind Raye&#146;s head, playing with her dark hair. Raye pressed Mina to her 
by placing her hand on the small of her back, causing Mina to arch her 
back and moan.

Both girls broke the kiss and looked deep into each other&#146;s eyes. Raye 
ran her finger along Mina&#146;s neck; Mina smiled and tilted her head to the 
side. Raye kissed Mina&#146;s neck, softly, her sharp sighs of pleasure and 
began licking a cord that seemed to make Mina cry out. She lifted her 
hands to Mina&#146;s chest and brushed her fingertips over the nipples. They 
were hard and Mina gasped.

The thunderstorm outside was still growing stronger and stronger, but 
the girls didn&#146;t care anymore. The rain was slaming against Raye&#146;s 
window, making it so no sound could be heard from the room from the 
outside. Lightning would once in a while lights up the room, showing the 
passionate things the girls were doing, only for an instant.

Raye rolled Mina onto her back, pinning her to the floor, kissing her 
hard and rubbing her hands up and down Mina&#146;s body. Mina reached up, 
pinching Raye&#146;s nipples through the flimsy material and soon took it off 
all together. Mina pulled away from Raye, Rolled her around roughly and 
started to lick and nibble on Raye&#146;s tits.

Raye&#146;s eyes rolled to the back of her head and she cried out Mina&#146;s 
name. She curled her fingers in Mina&#146;s hair, pulling her harder against 
herself. Mina bit down a little, sensing Raye liked it rough and she 
sobbed in ecstasy. Raye wrapped her legs around Mina humping up against 
her, trying to feel more and more.

Mina pulled away, kneeling next to Raye grinning. Raye looked up, half 
lidded, almost purring and Mina pulled off Raye&#146;s panties, grabbed her 
by the wrists, pinning them next to her sides and tongued around Raye&#146;s 
lower lips. Raye held her breath and thrust her hips forward, trying to 
make Mina penetrate her but Mina completely pulled herself away, a moan 
escaped Raye as she looked down at Mina.

Mine looked up at her evilly, &#147;Beg for it.&#148;

&#147;Oh please Mina-chan! Tongue fuck me, I want it so bad. Please&#133;&#148; She 
cried out as Mina pushed her long tongue into Raye, going in and out. 
Raye bit her lip, trying not to scream, but gasping, calling out Mina&#146;s 
name. &#147;Oh yes, Mina! Yes! Fuck me! Just like that! Nnn! Right there! Oh 
Mina! Nehh!&#148; Mina felt Raye convulse and her body shake. Raye gave out a 
choked sob as the hard orgasm rushed through her. Her body relaxed and 
Mina licked away some of Raye&#146;s love fluid.

Mina slid up Raye&#146;s body and kissed her softly. Raye returned it with 
what energy she had left. Mina nuzzled against Raye&#146;s neck, &#147;I figured 
you&#146;d like it rough, my little war goddess&#133;&#148; Raye stirred slightly and 
moved her mouth next to Mina&#146;s ear, &#147;And I take it, my little love 
goddess, that you like it in the opposite way?&#148; Raye could feel Mina 
smile into her neck.

Raye moved her was down Mina&#146;s body, softly pecking her lips then moving 
to her breasts, which were now unclad, &#145;when did that happen?&#146; Raye 
thought. Mina was giving out soft little cooing noises as Raye popped 
Mina&#146;s nipple into her mouth and began to suck it tenderly. She did this 
for a minute and then move to the next mound. Mina was thrashing her 
head from side to side right before Raye stopped.

Mina felt her panties slid down her long legs and could feel the wetness 
that clung to them run down her legs too. Raye softly blew cool air into 
Mina&#146;s lips, making Mina shiver before Raye licked her with her hot 
tongue. Mina squinted her eyes, arching her back letting out a noise 
that couldn&#146;t be described. 

Raye continued to lick as Mina began mumbling words between incoherency. 
&#147;Ummm, yes, ohh. There, nnnn&#133;&#148; Raye started flicking her tongue over the 
nod she knew would make Mina scream, which she did. Mina screamed just 
as a huge strike of lightning and thunder hit. Her voice was drowned, 
but Raye could feel it throb through her, entering Raye through her 
tongue, which was flicking wildly over this spot.

Mina stopped backing and gasped as her orgasm rocked through her, it hit 
her in waves and the waves rocked her and tossed her and Raye continued 
licking until Mina&#146;s after shocks subsided.

When Mina woke, Raye was holding her, sleeping quietly. The rain was 
slowing and coming down softly outside. She brushed a lock of Raye&#146;s 
dark hair out of her face. Raye&#146;s eyes fluttered open, &#147;Hmmmm&#133;&#148; She 
smiled and looked into Mina&#146;s eyes, &#147;I told you&#133; I think opposites 
attract.&#148; They kissed again and both drifted off into sleep.
~The End~
