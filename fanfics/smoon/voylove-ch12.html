<p>Remembering Friendships</p>
<p><strong>Section: Mina/Sets</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part One: Mina's POV</strong></p>
<p>I'm  so bored... Rei-chan what are you doing now? I miss you so much... it's  had to have been at least ten days since I saw you last... (more like a  day and half) Ahh... will this forest never end!</p>
<p>I wonder if  you've found any of my scratchings, Rei-chan... have you left anything  for me? Hmm... I know you must be with the Princess now, by the energy  signatures... and we <em>should</em> be heading to the same hill...  Waiii! I wonder who will get there first? If I do, maybe I should hide,  and then tackle you when you come. Would you be happy? Would you blush  and pull me off, playing it down until we're alone? Or would you not  care about an audience, and give me one of your passionate kisses...  and then... and then...</p>
<p>“Mi-Minako-san?”</p>
<p>Half-startled out of my thoughts, I looked up at Setsuna. “Hmm? What is it?”</p>
<p>She  had a strange look on her, as if she could see right through me and  knew my thoughts of you Rei-chan... At the giggle that escaped me,  something must have worried her, because she walked back down the  incline and put the back of her hand on my forehead. “Are you all  right? Your temperature seems fine, but your cheeks are a rather  unnatural shade of red.”</p>
<p>A small smile grew to a cheesy grin as  my mind kicked back and continued to think of you, my Rei-chan. I think  my outward appearance was starting to really worry Setsuna.</p>
<p>By  the time that little fantasy ended- both of us worn out and sated might  I add- I blinked and realized Setsuna was carrying me on her back  again. Aw, the gracious dear, she didn't have to do that. Just as I was  about to tell her I was all right, I saw a bird flash in a streak of  sunlight, and I thought of your Firebird. Oh what wicked things you can  do with your fire Rei-chan... especially with the fire burning inside  of you...</p>
<p>The sun had set before I was ready to think of anything  else but you. In that time, Setsuna had set me down against the trunk  of a tree, and she had gone to find something worth eating for dinner.  What else could hold any priority in my mind then my lovely Senshi of  Passion? Ahh, there goes my stomach again. I wonder if Sirens get  hungry, or can they feed well enough on the people they lure? Oh,  Rei-chan, if I sing, will you let me eat you? Just a little for now is  fine... I promise to savor you... I giggled again. Rei-chan! Hurry and  come find me so that I can go back to living out my dreams!</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Setsuna's POV</strong></p>
<p>As  I walked back to where I had left Mina, instinct told me to be quiet in  my approach. Sure enough, as I cleared the last bush, I found her sound  asleep, that same happy-go-lucky grin on her angelic face. A soft sigh  escaped my lips as I seated myself beside her, dinner all but  forgotten. Seeing a rogue tendril of hair beginning to mask her  sleeping features, I carefully eased it back behind her ear. She  continued to sleep.</p>
<p>A moment's hesitation led to snuggling up to  Mina under the soft, starry night. In retaliation, perhaps towards the  feel of a warm body, she draped one of her legs over on of my own, and  clutched my nearest arm as she rested her cheek on my shoulder. I was  nearly ready to allow myself the joy of seeing my love returned, when  she mumbled happily, “Rei-chan...” followed by another soft sigh of  contentment. I sighed as I looked back up to the stars. This would be a  long night, happy or not.</p>
<p>Tracing the constellations, as I was  not likely to sleep for quite some time, my mind wandered to my own  selfish reasons for accompanying the Princess on her journey.  Naturally, as the Queen's Chancellor, I was encouraged to stay behind,  to help care for the Kingdom, but my vision would not let my heart at  ease.</p>
<p><strong>Flashback Vision</strong></p>
<p>“Rei-chan... I'm so glad you're back... that <em>we</em> made it back.” Mina snuggled closer to Rei, though as both were  unclothed underneath the sheets, they couldn't have gotten much closer.  “I love you.”</p>
<p>The raven-haired priestess smiled and took a moment to absorb the scent of Mina's hair. “I know. I love you, too.”</p>
<p>A  few moments of silence passed before Mina asked, “Do you think we would  have realized each other's love, if it hadn't been for that shipping  expedition?”</p>
<p>Rei laughed lightly. “I don't know if I'd call it  that, but I don't know, we probably would have made it known  eventually, just not for a while yet.”</p>
<p>“What would you have gotten for my birthday if we hadn't?”</p>
<p>A sly, teasing grin crossed Rei's expression. “Oh, let's see here... Maybe a dictionary of quotes?”</p>
<p>“Rei-chan!” Mina playfully swatted her lover, before murmuring, “Fine. Then I would have gotten you a fire extinguisher.”</p>
<p>The two shared a few more laughs at that. Then, there was a knock on the door. “Rei-sama? Breakfast is ready.”</p>
<p>To which Rei called back, “Thank you, Misha. I'll be there in a few minutes.”</p>
<p>As the soft pattering of footsteps faded away, Mina nuzzled Rei and asked, “Aww, why didn't you ask for breakfast in bed?”</p>
<p>Rei shook her head softly as she started to sit up. “Come on, Mina-chan. They'll be wondering where you went next.”</p>
<p><strong>End Flashback</strong></p>
<p>Another  sigh rose from my heart as I gazed down at the Senshi of Love. Dearest  Mina, I know you know how I feel, I know also that you could never  betray Rei, but at the same time... couldn't you also give our love a  chance?</p>
<p>A soft giggle bubbled from Mina's lips as she whispered, “Oh you. Sometimes you're just too sweet to me. I'll get cavities...!”</p>
<p><strong>Section: Ruka/Mich</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part One: Michiru's POV</strong></p>
<p>These  trees have benefited a lot from the moisture of the ocean, and the sun  seems to hit them at just the right spots... interesting... I'll have  to remember it for future-</p>
<p>“What about you?”</p>
<p>My mind was  clearly off in a whole other tangent at that point. It didn't stop me  from being irritable towards her though. “What <em>about</em> me?”</p>
<p>That  didn't deter her in the slightest. Breaking off a twig from a nearby  branch, she started carving it as she walked. “Do you have any turning  points in your life that made you see everything a lot differently? I'm  not sure about mine- just that I know I had one.”</p>
<p>I gave her a  derisive scoff. It would have been a snort, if such wasn't as ladylike  as my reputation. “Even if there was, why on Earth do you think I'd  tell <em>you</em>?”</p>
<p>It was a shot in the dark. She couldn't  possibly have known me as well as her answer led a part of me to  believe. “Oh I don't know... I was just wondering if something happened  in your past that made you all snippy and stuff. You weren't like this  when I last saw you in the Kingdom. Did you have a really bad break up  with a boyfriend or something?”</p>
<p>I think she noticed my flinch. Or maybe it was the hesitation in my next step. Either way, she asked, “Did I strike a nerve?”</p>
<p>I  tried to shake it off. “It's nothing. I was just wondering how you  could have possibly gotten that idea, when it's nowhere near the truth.  When did you decide that men had to break up with <em>me</em> for it to be bad?” I think I tried a bit too hard.</p>
<p>“All  right. I'll give you that much, but you don't seem like the kind of  teenager growing up that would “break up” with someone on any terms. I  figure you'd rather take one look at them, judge them, and if they  weren't up to snuff, reject them before they could even start courting.”</p>
<p>“And how did you come to <em>that</em> conclusion?”</p>
<p>I  think she grinned then- I could sense it in her voice- but my back was  turned to her. “Hey, we were good friends back in the day, weren't we?  Way <em>way</em> back in the day, before I started rebelling against dre-...sses...”</p>
<p>I  tried very hard not to flinch again, but I think my body did so just to  spite me. She was closing in on it, and I had barely said anything.</p>
<p>“Does your turning point have to do with me?”</p>
<p><em>Shake your head! Idiot! Don't let her know! Shake. Your. Head.</em> I nodded. May my nervous system be barbecued a thousand times over for listening to my heart instead of my head.</p>
<p>There  was a long silence, before Haruka grabbed my arm- though her grip  wasn't at all hurtful. “Let's stop here for today. After I get the fire  going, I'll go find us something to eat.”</p>
<p>I was going to protest  that the sun had yet to set, that she didn't have to do all that, but  my actions refused to respond to my brain's instructions. “Don't leave  me... not again.”</p>
<p>She turned around then- she had just been ready  to go find firewood- and gave me that silly grin. That grin she would  always give me to cheer me up when I was little. My eyes squeezed shut  as the ice around my heart began to melt, the water escaping from  around my eyes in unison. She didn't say anything. She only held me to  her, one hand on my head, stroking it gently, the other supporting my  back. When she said those special, heartfelt words to me, the dam  really broke, and I began crying in earnest.</p>
<p>“I'm sorry, Michi.”</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Haruka's POV</strong></p>
<p>We  stayed like that for a long time, since I really couldn't say much else  to her. I really wanted to yell at myself for being so stupid though.  Really, Michi was my best friend in the whole world, even after I left.  If I missed her, why <em>wouldn't</em> she have missed me? I'm such an idiot.</p>
<p>When I came out to our friends- mostly just the Senshi at that point- it was her reaction that I found my emotions riding upon.</p>
<p>Rei-chan,  she looked at me strange for a few moments, and then said Kami-sama was  planning strange things for us in the times ahead. She said she wasn't  like that, and as long as I didn't try anything, she was fine with it.  At least, that's what she said. Since that day, she was just a tad more  weary of me then before. Thinking back to when Mina told us about her  and Rei, that was probably part of the reason she was blushing so hard  about it, almost refusing not to accept the feelings at all. Kami bless  her heart for love in the end though.</p>
<p>Mina-chan, she asked me  what was so bad about boys, that I would turn to girls for love. I  answered that I was just too much of a boy myself for any relationship  to really work out, and besides, girls were just so much cuter in a  whole different way. She just shrugged and told me “whatever sinks your  float,” which had brought a course of laughter all around. But then,  maybe my answer had helped kindle her own acceptance for how she felt  or would feel for Rei. It was hard to tell with the Senshi of Love.</p>
<p>Mako-chan, she considered for a moment, and then patted me hard on the back. She joked- or at least I <em>think</em> it was a joke- “Good idea- these guys stink something awful. Maybe I'll  join you one of these days.” Now I wonder if there wasn't some sort of  irony that she was taken along with me when the pirates took us, all of  them being guys who <em>literally</em> stunk something awful, from lack of proper hygiene.</p>
<p>Ami-chan...  she stared at me for a while, before pulling out her computer and  asking if I would reconsider, at least long enough to produce an heir-  while being at an appropriate age for childbirth. I'd blanched at that,  saying that while no pain meant no gain, I'd rather live without the  pain of giving birth. She's probably still worried to this day, and  planning on getting more worried, now that Rei and Mina are getting  together. Hmm... maybe <em>that</em> was an ulterior motive for going with the Princess?</p>
<p>Usagi-chan...  our dumpling princess... she didn't get it at all. She asked what I  meant by “I'm into girls” and it had to be explained extensively before  a light bulb went off in that head of hers, and she asked what made me  switch over. I didn't think I could tell them the truth of it then, so  I said that if I was going to be fighting with a whole bunch of girls,  I might as well get to like them better than the enemies (who are  generally guys). There was an eerie silence before I told them it was a  joke. Even then, the laughter was strained.</p>
<p>Queen Serenity smiled with an understanding that even <em>I </em>couldn't  understand. She told me if that was the path I was happiest with, then  I should embrace it as such. Setsuna just told me she had foreseen it,  and therefore, it was of no concern to her. Hotaru was just a little  baby then, and even by the time I left, she was still too young, so I  didn't have to worry about her reaction. I tangled a toy in front of  her while I told her, and she gurgled and clapped her hands for me.</p>
<p>And  Michi? Ah Michi... such a comical character, as a kid. She had her arms  folded, and she just raised an eyebrow as I told her. “And? Don't tell  me you just figured that one out, Ruka. I've known for a long time.”  When I asked her why she hadn't mentioned it then, she just told me she  thought I wasn't so stupid as to not have learned that by now. Just  when I was about to blow up at her, she just muttered, “I'm happy for  you all the same,” and walked away, reminding the others that there was  a ball to get ready for that night.</p>
<p>Michi was the one that made  me turn my head towards the other gender. On the night of her twelfth  birthday, she had the grace that some <em>ladies</em> had not a spark  to. Wearing those heels, with one of her favorite sea green dresses, I  swear she inherited the name of Lady Neptune right there and then. The  guys sensed it immediately too, and for some reason, as I walked  around- so as to not be caught watching her from any one point- I  started to tell the guys that looks were only skin deep, and that she  was a real witch on the inside. Halfway through the night, when Rei  caught me in the act and asked why I was saying things like that, it  occurred to me. I didn't want them interested in her. I didn't want <em>her</em> to be interested in <em>them</em>.</p>
<p>All because I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>Section: Mako/Ami</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part One: Ami's POV</strong></p>
<p>I  wanted to blush and stammer, to tell her that didn't come out right...  but as she watched me, a strange gleam in her eyes, I lost all nerve to  succeed in doing even that much. So instead, I just stood there,  waiting for her response. Waiting for her to take those mesmerizing  emerald eyes off of mine...</p>
<p>Eventually, she laughed and shrugged,  turning back around. “Maybe. You know, come to think of it, trees need  a lot of water and support to shine too.” She paused, as if considering  something, before shaking it off and gesturing for me to follow. “Come  on, the Princess is waiting for us.”</p>
<p>I waited until she had  started moving again before starting to walk behind her. I seemed to be  doing that a lot as of late. She noticed this time, at least, enough  now to do something about it. With a quiet sigh, she backtracked until  she was walking alongside me, at the same pace.</p>
<p>As if to preserve a peace between us, she asked me, “Hey, you ever notice how the sky turns really red around this time?”</p>
<p>Looking  up, I answered automatically, “It's only natural. When the sun  approaches the horizon, the atmosphere is more apt to- what is it?”</p>
<p>She  was smiling at me. I'm not sure why, but she was smiling at me. But  then, she turned away and shook her head. “Naw, it's nothing. Go on.  The atmosphere is more apt to what?”</p>
<p>I hesitated, looking back at  her as she watched the trees rustle around us, but eventually continued  what turned out to be a rather long winded explanation. By the time  there was nothing more to tell, the sun had set. But Mako-chan still  had that serene smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Let's make camp here. This den, some animal probably burrowed here a long time ago, and the form stayed. We'll be fine.”</p>
<p>I looked at her, and then at the proffered den. “It seems rather... cramped though, doesn't it?”</p>
<p>She shrugged, starting to pick up fallen branches for firewood. “I won't mind if you don't mind.”</p>
<p>I  think my heart soared to the skies with that phrase. Could that mean...  even just a small possibility.? Either way, if I could spend the night  so close to her... I'd happily stay stranded on the island for a while  longer, with her.</p>
<p>“It doesn't seem right.” Her sudden proximity jolted me out of my daze.</p>
<p>“Wha- what do you mean?”</p>
<p>I  think she sensed my thoughts were far away, considering her grin. With  no forethought, she dropped the pile of firewood at our feet. “Being  who we are, being here, it just doesn't feel right to create a fire,  even for warmth.”</p>
<p>I felt my cheeks grow red with where my  thoughts had gone up to that last bit. Then her words began to sink in,  and I gave her a small smile. “I suppose you're right, but all the  same, if something happens, I can always put it out.”</p>
<p>My pulse  quickened as she pulled closer, whispering into my ear as if it would  be a secret even from the wildlife around us. “Or maybe between my  electricity and our body warmth, we won't need to start one at all.”</p>
<p>I desperately wanted to kiss her for that one.</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Makoto's POV</strong></p>
<p>What  am I doing? I'm not supposed to see Ami-chan, or any girl really, like  this. Why is it that seeing her in the shaft of moonlight... I want to  hug her, kiss her... tell her I love her? It has to be the island.  There's something up with this island. It just has to be. I can't be  feeling all this on my own.</p>
<p>“A- ami-chan?”</p>
<p>I must have blanked out for a moment, because I do <em>not</em> remember pulling her into an embrace, or sliding down the tree so that  she was sitting with her back to me, between my legs. Still... I  admit... it felt rather nice all things considered...</p>
<p>“Mmm?”</p>
<p>Well,  she seemed to be enjoying herself, or at least, not finding anything  worth complaining about, so I sighed and leaned back. “It's nothing.  Good night.”</p>
<p>“Mm... sweet dreams, Mako-chan.”</p>
<p>we'll sort it out in the morning. For now... yes... sweet dreams, Ami-chan.</p>
<p><strong>Dream Phase</strong></p>
<p>“Ami-chan..!”  A young Mako-chan proceeds to tug on the arm of a studious Ami-chan.  “Come out a play with us! The book'll still be there when we come back,  right?”</p>
<p>Ami-chan wrinkled her nose. “The... but the UV rays  Mako-chan! It'll damage your skin and you'll break out with freckles  and insert scientific name for zits, if there is one! It's not healthy!”</p>
<p>Mako-chan  refused to give up. “Neither is staying indoors on a perfectly nice  day! Come on, when we inherit our titles, we'll never get these chances  again!”</p>
<p>But the studious Ami-chan had gotten to a rather good  part in the book, and she wanted to finish it. “Mako-chan! I really  want to finish reading about insert very long scientific name for a  certain type of dinosaur before we're called to dinner. There's some  things about ancient plants in here that I know you'd like, too!”</p>
<p>Ami-chan's  best friend knew what she was getting at, and would have none of it.  “Bah, I still say it'll be there when you get back. Look! The Earth's  going to be full the whole day, and you'd rather sit here reading?”</p>
<p>“It was full yesterday too Mako-chan. And it'll be full tomorrow too.”</p>
<p>“That's  not the point! You need to get out more often Ami-chan! Smell the  flowers and all that stuff.” Mako-chan hesitated, before adding, “It  might even make it easier to remember things- make you smarter.”</p>
<p>Ami-chan  actually looked like she was considering it, before she sighed and  shook her head. “I checked the botanical index already, Mako-chan.  There aren't any Lunar plants like that.”</p>
<p>Mako-chan waited in  sulky silence for a few minutes, watching as Ami-chan stuck her nose  back in her books. She shifted her weight from one foot to the other  before throwing her hands up in exasperation and stalking off with a  grumble of, “Fine, then I'll just have to bring the sights to you.”</p>
<p>The future Senshi of Wisdom watched as Mako-chan left, but after a small sigh, continued to read.</p>
<p>A  few moments though they were really hours later, Mako-chan returned,  and thrust a flower between Ami-chan's nose and the book. Said action  positively startled her into bolting her head up like an elk caught in  the headlights. She then took a more scrutinizing look at the flower,  and gasped. Holding it lightly within her own grasp, she murmured,  “Mako-chan! This is one of the Queen's roses! You... where did you get  this? You shouldn't have taken it!”</p>
<p>Mako-chan only grinned, hands  behind her back as she rocked on her heels. “That's for you. And don't  worry- I help out with the gardening, so the Queen won't mind. You know  the legend about these roses though?”</p>
<p>As Ami-chan continued to stare in awe at the crystalline rose, Mako-chan assumed she didn't, and summarized the legend for her.</p>
<p>“They  say if you make a wish on them, the person you love will give you a  real rose when the time is right. Are you going to make a wish?”</p>
<p>A furious blush rose on Ami-chan's cheeks. “I- I'm too young for that sort of thing! But... but thank you for this, Mako-chan.”</p>
<p>“Will you come with me to see the garden? It's really pretty when the Earth and Mars are where they are today.”</p>
<p>Ami-chan  considered it a moment, before sighing and placing her bookmark in and  setting aside the book. Clambering off the chair, she caved in, “Oh,  all right. But no more picking! It really hinders the growth of the  flowers!”</p>
<p>Mako-chan laughed and tugging Ami-chan's hand, saying, “You think I don't know that? But when the flower <em>does</em> grow back, it's always more beautiful than the last!”</p>
<p><strong>End Dream Phase</strong></p>
<p>Makoto  blinked and looked around. The moon was high in the sky now, and  Ami-chan was still snuggled in her hold. With a soft smile, Mako placed  her cheek on the crown of her head, and whispered, “Our friendship will  grow more beautiful than when we saw each other last, right Ami-chan?”</p>
<p>In response, Ami merely sighed and snuggled deeper into the embrace.</p>
<p><strong>Section: Rei/Usagi</strong></p>
<p><strong>Part One: Rei's POV</strong></p>
<p>Idiot  meatball head. I watched as Usagi turned to face me as she talked, and  in doing so hit her head on a low branch. With a soft sigh, I walked  over and checked it to make sure it wasn't bleeding, and then made sure  I knew I thought she was an idiot for it. She only stuck her tongue at  me, and started walking again. I had to correct her course at first,  but afterwards, she just continued on. That's when I saw it.</p>
<p>On  the tree that Usagi had been hit with, there was an unmistakable heart  scratched on the trunk.. with the initials... I smiled, even as a light  blush came to me. Mina had been here. An arrow through a heart, huh?</p>
<p>There  was little time to think it through before Usagi called me, so I just  quickly placed my hand over it, and a summoned a small flame. When I  left it, a scorched handprint lay over the heart.</p>
<p><em>Even if my hand holds your heart, Mina-chan, I'll protect it from the fire. </em>(or so it should represent)</p>
<p>I  had to run a little to catch up to Usagi, but she didn't seem to mind.  As we started walking side by side again, my mind got to thinking about  the past.. my thirteenth birthday in particular.</p>
<p><strong>Flashback</strong></p>
<p>She  hadn't been at the celebration for my gaining my Senshi powers. All the  other Senshi were there, as was the entire royal court, and the Queen.  But she wasn't. And that was all that had really mattered to me. During  the ball, I snuck away and walked to her bedroom chambers. I knocked on  the door, but there was no answer. Hoping nothing was wrong, I slowly  opened the door, surprised to find it unlocked. The bed was made, and  as I walked over to it, I found a note on your pillow. Addressed to me.</p>
<p><em>Rei-chan:</em></p>
<p><em>You're probably wondering why I wasn't there, huh? Well, come to the old mansion on Cherry Hill</em> (I figured I'd give the hill that Mako-chan and Usagi-chan practiced at a name)<em> alone, and I'll tell you, all right?</em></p>
<p><em>Hoping you've found this before midnight,</em></p>
<p><em>Mina-chan</em></p>
<p>I had smiled upon seeing that, and, still dressed in my ball gown, I walked out and over to Cherry Hill.</p>
<p>It  was completely dark when I arrived. I rang the doorbell, and some bats  flew out of a window of the attic. Just as I was letting out a soft  sigh, the door creaked open. Considering I saw only darkness within, I  lit a small guiding flame in my hand- a trick I had learned and  mastered just today- and walked inside.</p>
<p>I had no idea where I was  supposed to go, so I decided to start at the dining hall. Nothing. The  kitchen- nothing. The parlor- nothing. On and on I continued,  eventually walking up the crickity steps.</p>
<p>I checked the bedrooms  as I walked along the hallway, figuring that if she was in any room,  she'd be in plain sight. It wasn't until I lit the end of the hallway,  that I found her. Just not in any position I would have been  comfortable with under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Hanging from a noose,  head and arms limp, was Mina. There was a thin red line appearing from  her mouth, and as I stepped closer, I saw that her eyes had rolled  back. Fear coursed through me, no, more like utmost horror. I stood  there for a long time, wondering what I was going to do without my best  friend- whom I was just starting to love- and why she did it. And why  she had called me over on my thirteenth birthday to let this image burn  in my mind for a likely eternity.</p>
<p>Before ten minutes had passed,  a low, horrific scream had wrenched itself from my throat. Tears came  flowing from my eyes as I crumbled to the ground, the flame just  floating in midair... like her.</p>
<p>And then I heard it. “Surprise! Did I scare you?”</p>
<p>Almost  believing Mina had already turned into a ghost, and was now talking to  me, I looked up, and there she was, live and whole, out of the noose. A  hand slowly rose, as if to make sure she was really there, and she sunk  down to sit next to me, holding my hand.</p>
<p>As soon as I got my  senses back under order, realizing she had never really hung herself, I  slapped her hard with my free hand. She sat there, shocked, a hand  coming to rest over where my hand had left a red welt.</p>
<p>Tears still streaming in my eyes, I whispered, “Why the hell did you have to make such a sick joke?”</p>
<p>Her  smile wavered, before solidifying. Her eyes softened, as she took both  of my hands in hers. Then, she whispered back, “Last year, do you  remember? I asked you what you'd like for your birthday, and you told  me how everyone tries and fails to capture the horror of All Hallow's  Eve around that time of the year. You said that for once, you'd like to  be honestly and truly petrified with horror. And I said that if it was  in my power to, I'd make all your wishes come true. Don't you remember?  That was all I was trying to do.” She hesitated, and then, “Did I go  too far?”</p>
<p>I wanted to slap her again for that one. I <em>did</em> actually remember that day. I just didn't realize <em>she</em> remembered it. Shaking from the shudders that were still being wrenched from me, I pulled her into a sudden embrace.</p>
<p>“Idiot. <em>Idiot.</em> Never <em>ever</em> do that to me again. Even if I ask for it, <em>never</em> do that to me.”</p>
<p>“I...  sorry, Rei-chan.” There was a long silence after that, before Minako  whispered, “Do you still want the birthday cake I made for you?”</p>
<p>By  then, the tears had mostly stopped, and I slowly pushed myself an arm's  length from her to look at her. She smiled nervously, before nodding  towards the corner. Together, we crawled over, the flame following us,  and I saw a silver lidded platter sitting atop a low stool. Carefully,  she removed the lid, and as I looked down on it, whispered, “Happy  Birthday Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>It was a chocolate cake, messily iced, in the  form of a heart. In the center of it, a card was propped up that read  in Minako's neat, flowing cursive, “Happy 13th Rei-chan:</p>
<p>To the bestest friend in the whole world- Given with Mina's Love.”</p>
<p>The  tears started flowing again, even as I whispered, “I don't think  'bestest' is a word, Mina-chan.” But the smile stayed on my face for  weeks afterwards whenever I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>End Flashback</strong></p>
<p>“Rei-chan?”  I bolted out of my daze to see that the Princess was giving me a  concerned look, and was standing right in front of me. “What's wrong?  Are you all right?”</p>
<p>I was about to ask her what gave her any idea that I <em>wasn't</em> all right, when I felt another tear travel down my cheek. I smiled  softly as I wiped away the tears, and strode ahead. “I'm all right,  meatball head. I was just remembering a special birthday.”</p>
<p><strong>Part Two: Usagi's POV</strong></p>
<p>She was crying. Rei <em>never</em> cries. My heart went out to her, wishing I knew what it was. But after  I caught up to her, the tears were already drying, and she had a  wistful smile on her face. I watched her still, though she didn't break  out again. Somewhere down the line, she noticed my consistent glances,  and sighed.</p>
<p>“Don't worry about it Usagi. It had nothing to do with you, okay?”</p>
<p>It was <em>not</em> okay. I had to know. “Then who? I'm worried, Rei-chan. You don't usually-”</p>
<p>“I was thinking about Mina's gift to me for my thirteenth birthday, all right? Now forget it.”</p>
<p>I  was completely and utterly mystified. Mina was the one Rei loved. They  were best friends in the Kingdom. Why would her gift make Rei sad?</p>
<p>Most  likely seeing my expression and guessing my thoughts, Rei added, “Happy  tears. I was really happy. Now stop looking at me like that.”</p>
<p>I couldn't help it. “Like what?”</p>
<p>She sighed and shook her head. “Like my whole family just died and you don't know what to say.”</p>
<p>There was a long silence between us. Now that I thought about it, no one ever <em>did</em> let on to what Mina's gift that day was for Rei. Everyone else's gifts  had been given to her at the ball. Rei had disappeared a little before  the gift giving could commence, but she came back about two hours later  with Mina, a small but genuine smile on her face. Had she been crying  then too? I remember seeing her eyes a little red, but when I asked  about it, she waved it off, saying she'd overused her fire a bit too  much that day, and it'd go away overnight.</p>
<p>She obviously <em>had </em>given  Rei-chan a gift- there was no way they could have been best friends and  Mina-chan would miss an opportunity like that. But neither of them  would say. From the others, I learned that whenever someone asked,  they'd smile lightly and change the subject.</p>
<p>Now I was <em>really</em> curious.</p>
<p>Around  that time, I think Rei must have realized I didn't know what Mina's  gift had been then, and she hastily looked to the sky. “It's getting  late. After we eat, you should go to sleep, Princess. I'll stay guard,  and keep a fire going.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think we'd be attacked? This island seems deserted.”</p>
<p>Rei  shook it off, firing small zings of fire to let the fruit drop off.  “You're the Princess, Usagi. I'm not going to take any chances.”</p>
<p>I  didn't complain about having to eat just fruit for dinner. It was  really good fruit, and in any case, I was too preoccupied with  wondering what the gift that made Rei cry was. She didn't say anything  the whole night. She handed me some fruit to munch on while she cooked  fruit kabobs in a well contained fire. After we ate, she made some  flying leaps, and plucked several giant leaves from the large tree next  to us. Situating a bed from it between the raised roots of the tree,  she motioned for me to lie there and rest.</p>
<p>I asked her where she  was going to sleep, and she grinned, saying she didn't need to sleep,  but she'd sit on the high root over me as I slept. I worried about her  health then, but as she absently began humming an old lullaby, my eyes  drifted closed, and the last thing I remember hearing was her whisper,  “If dat darn cake don't wanna rise... I'ma gonna get'cha chocolate free  of flies...”</p>
