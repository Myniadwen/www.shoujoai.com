A beautiful South Seas island comes into view, complete with large 
breasted natives and gentle breezes stirring the palm branches on the 
beach. As the camera pans, a very familiar looking woman is seen sitting 
on the sand in her fancy toga, a native girl massaging her shoulders as 
she sips a drink out of a coconut. She looks up, smiling as she notices 
the camera.
 
&quot;Hello ladies and gentleman, but especially you ladies,&quot; she says with a 
wink, &quot;It&#39;s me, your favorite lesbian Greek poet Sappho here, to 
introduce the new omake. Tonight&#39;s entry is...&quot;
 
&quot;Sappho,&quot; a rather tall native woman said as she carried a tied-up and 
gagged Japanese woman over, &quot;I got her for you.&quot;
 
Sappho looked at both the island native and her captive in shock, 
&quot;What?&quot; she asked confusedly, &quot;I didn&#39;t ask you to abduct anyone. I 
asked you to go and get me some food.&quot;
 
&quot;Food?&quot; The native asked as the young Japanese girl struggled in her 
arms, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought you said Fuu. You know, from Samurai 
Champloo?
 
&quot;Wha... Put her down this minute!&quot; Sappho ordered. As the large native 
put the captive down on her feet, Sappho quickly came over and began 
untying her, &quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry about this,&quot; she said as she released 
the woman&#39;s hands, &quot;You weren&#39;t hurt, were you?&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Fuu answered as she removed her gag, &quot;I&#39;m actually getting used to 
being kidnapped by now. Say, what&#39;s with the all the people out there?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh them? They&#39;re the audience,&quot; Sappho explained. She then turned to 
the large native and told her to bring Fuu a drink. As the tall woman 
left, she then turned to her new companion, &quot;I was just about to 
introduce the new omake, actually. Care to join me?&quot;
 
Fuu nodded, and they both sat back down. Fuu received her drink as 
Sappho addressed the audience once again, &quot;Anyways folks; sit back, 
relax, and enjoy tonight&#39;s omake. We...&quot;
 
&quot;Umm... Sappho,&quot; Fuu interrupted.
 
&quot;Yes Fuu?&quot;
 
&quot;Thanks for the drink and all, but could you please remove your hand 
from my rear?&quot;
 
Sappho frowned as she moved her hand, &quot;Spoil sport,&quot; she grumbled 
disappointedly, &quot;Anyways, here&#39;s the new omake. Enjoy.&quot;

---Omake Twenty-Eight: The Merry Adventures of Robin Hino---
 
Out in the midst of a beautiful forest in the district of Sherwood, 
England, in the late twelfth century, a deer ran through an emerald 
green clearing, looking about itself majestically as a bird flew high 
over the leafy canopy of the trees. At a sound a short distance away, 
the great buck rushed off into the deep foliage to its left. Soon a 
woman came into the clearing, dressed in green tights with a green 
shirt. She had a leather vest over her shirt, and a green cap with a 
feather in it resting atop her head. On her shoulder she carried her bow 
and arrows, her dark black hair flowing freely down her back. The young 
woman smiled broadly as she placed her hands on her hips and breathed in 
the fresh morning air.
 
&quot;Robin Hino!&quot; a voice cried out, &quot;Hey, wait up.&quot;
 
The famous outlaw Robin Hino, once known as Lady Rei of Loxley, turned 
to see her Merry Women coming up to join her. There was Little Mako, her 
nickname given her as a good-natured joke because of the fact she was 
taller than the other outlaws. There was also Ami Scarlett, the smart 
but hot-tempered member of the merry band who was always quick with the 
sword.
 
And of course, the outlaw band&#39;s traveling minstrel, Mina-a-Dale, who 
began to dance around the group flashing a near maniacal smile as she 
began clanging two spoons together on her thigh as she began to sing.
 
......
 
O Robin Hino and her Merry Women,
 
Went out in two and threes.
 
They robbed from the rich to give to the poor,
 
And for their trouble ended up with fleas.&quot;
 
......
 
&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; Little Mako grumbled, &quot;Who ever heard of a 
minstrel playing the spoons?&quot;
 
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Robin added, &quot;And as far as the fleas go, how was I to know ye 
olde dog catcher was going to repay our generosity like that?&quot;
 
Just then, coming up the opposite side of the forest clearing, Friar 
Tenoh rode her donkey as fast as she could. &quot;Robin!&quot; she yelled out in 
her husky deep voice.
 
&quot;Friar Tenoh!&quot; Robin Hino said, noting the alarm in the ecclesiastic&#39;s 
voice, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;
 
&quot;Terrible news!&quot; the good friar exclaimed, the top of the pillow she had 
tucked underneath her costume just visible at the base of her neck, &quot;The 
evil Sheriff of Nottingham, Chiba Mamoru, has kidnapped the fair Maid 
Usagi, locking her in the top of a great stone tower in his castle!&quot;
 
&quot;No!&quot; Hino cried out in anguish as Ami Scarlett rushed over.
 
&quot;Good friar,&quot; Ami said, &quot;How did you find out about this tretchery?&quot;
 
&quot;Me and my traveling companion, Sister Michiru, were traveling through 
the countryside when a message tied to an arrow flew towards us. Sadly, 
the good nun died, but...&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;m not quite dead yet!&quot; a stately-looking young nun shouted as she 
rode up to the group on her own donkey, an arrow with a message attached 
to it sticking out of her chest.
 
------
 
The beautiful blonde with the odangos was thrust unceremoniously into 
the room by the Sheriff of Nottingham. As the young woman cowered before 
him, a pair of guards followed them into the room.
 
&quot;You can&#39;t keep me here!&quot; Maid Usagi shrieked, &quot;My true love Robin Hino 
will rescue me!&quot;
 
&quot;Robin Hino?&quot; Mamoru sneered diabolically as he grabbed her wrist and 
threw her onto the bed in the room, &quot;Ha! She&#39;ll never get here in time! 
Before the sun sets, we&#39;ll be married, and it&#39;ll be too late for your 
precious Loxley lesbian to save you! Muwa Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot;
 
Mamoru continued to laugh evilly as he left the heartbroken Maid Usagi 
on her bed crying. He then walked over to the two guards he was leaving 
in charge of her, looking from the tall blonde Corsican beauty to the 
much younger dark-haired Japanese girl.
 
&quot;Right,&quot; he sneered over-dramatically as he prepared to give his final 
instructions, &quot;I want you two to stay here and... Hey, you,&quot; he said to 
the Japanese young woman.
 
&quot;Mmm,&quot; the young guard answered as she turned away from the window to 
look at him.
 
&quot;Stop looking out that window and listen!&quot; the Sheriff ordered.
 
&quot;Her name&#39;s Kirika,&quot; the blonde said in a heavy French accent, &quot;Not &#39;hey 
you.&#39; And she does that all the time. I have yet to find out what she 
looks at,&quot; she added as the younger guard came over.
 
&quot;Whatever,&quot; the Sheriff grumbled, &quot;Look, I want you two to stay here, 
and make sure she doesn&#39;t leave this room until I come and get her.&quot;
 
&quot;Right,&quot; Kirika said, her knowledge of medieval English sorely lacking 
in comparison to the Japanese of her homeland and the French spoken by 
her fellow guard, &quot;Make sure she doesn&#39;t leave this room even if you 
come and get her.&quot;
 
&quot;No,&quot; Mamoru corrected, &quot;Until I come and get her.&quot;
 
&quot;You mean,&quot; Mireille began as a look of confusion swept over her face, 
&quot;Until you come to get her, we&#39;re not to enter the room?&quot;
 
The Sheriff&#39;s face began to turn red, &quot;No,&quot; he growled out in a low 
tone, You two stay in the room, and make sure she doesn&#39;t leave.&quot;
 
&quot;Who?&quot; Kirika asked in a monotone as she pointed at the blonde next to 
her, &quot;Mireille?&quot;
 
The Sheriff of Nottingham shook his head, &quot;No, not her,&quot; he said 
exasperatedly, &quot;Usagi. Make sure Maid Usagi doesn&#39;t leave.&quot;
 
&quot;Who&#39;s Usagi?&quot; Mireille asked. Mamoru rolled his eyes in frustration.
 
&quot;Her! The blonde over there crying!&quot; he shouted angrily as he pointed at 
the youthful maiden weeping on the bed, &quot;Stay here, and make sure she 
doesn&#39;t leave!&quot;
 
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika answered. A thought suddenly came to her, &quot;What if we 
leave the room with her?&quot; she asked.
 
&quot;Wha... No! Keep her in the room...&quot;
 
&quot;Well yes,&quot; the blonde broke in, &quot;Obviously we have to keep her in the 
room, but if she did have to go...&quot;
 
&quot;Mmm,&quot; the Japanese guard added.
 
&quot;Look, it&#39;s simple...&quot; the Sheriff groaned, &quot;Just keep her here until 
I...&quot;
 
&quot;Or anyone else?&quot; Kirika asked in the same monotone that had been giving 
Mamoru the creeps since he&#39;d entered the room.
 
The Sheriff buried his head in his hand for a few seconds. Why in God&#39;s 
name had he decided to pick the Corsican and Japanese assassins to guard 
Maid Usagi? When it came to killing people, the two were unstoppable. 
Who knew that on something as simple as guard duty they&#39;d be this 
incompetent? &quot;No, not anyone else,&quot; he finally said, &quot;Just me.&quot;
 
Ten aggravating minutes later, having finally made sure they understood 
his instructions, he left the tearful Maid Usagi in the room with the 
smiling Mireille and the morbidly aloof Kirika who quickly went back to 
looking out the tower window.
 
------
 
O Robin Hino and her Merry Women,
 
Are off to save Usagi,
 
There will then follow most likely a yuri scene,
 
That will leave all our panties quite soggy.
 
......
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Robin Hino shouted, &quot;What are you trying to do, get us in trouble 
with the site administrator?&quot;
 
&quot;Enough with the dirty limericks!&quot; Ami Scarlett added as Little Mako 
came over with a long length of rope with a hook attached to it. She 
looked up to the tower window and saw a young dark-haired maiden in a 
guard&#39;s uniform looking back at her. As Sister Michiru came over with 
the arrow still in her chest, followed by Friar Tenoh, Little Mako began 
to swing the hooked end of the rope faster and faster, finally releasing 
it to sent it upward toward the window. It missed however, and the heavy 
hook fell back to earth where it landed on top of Friar Tenoh&#39;s head.
 
&quot;Tenoh?&quot; Sister Michiru asked tearfully as she knelt down by the 
sandy-blonde who was lying motionless on the ground, &quot;Oh no...&quot;
 
Amy Scarlett knelt down beside the nun to check on the friar, and 
frowned.
 
&quot;Poor, brave friar.&quot; Ami muttered, &quot;To have died like this, you...&quot;
 
&quot;I... I&#39;m not quite dead yet.&quot; The friar groaned as she sat up, rubbing 
the top of her head. Mina-a-Dale smiled happily as she pulled out her 
spoons again.
 
......
 
Oh Little Mako missed with the iron hook,
 
And clocked Friar Tenoh on the head.
 
We thought her a goner, but as it turned out,
 
She is not quite dead.
 
......
 
&quot;Mina, you blithering idiot!&quot; Little Mako shouted, &quot;Put those blasted 
spoons away!&quot;
 
Robin Hino rolled her eyes as she took the rope from Little Mako and, 
swinging it rapidly, let it fly. The hook grabbed onto the stone window 
sill with a &quot;clank&quot; sound.
 
------
 
&quot;Mireille,&quot; Kirika muttered softly as she turned away from her window to 
her blonde companion, &quot;Someone&#39;s climbing up to this room by rope.&quot;
 
&quot;Really?&quot; the Corsican assassin turned guard asked as she came over the 
window and looked down. She saw Robin Hino climbing up a rope to the 
tower prison, followed closely behind by her band of Merry Women, &quot;Good 
grief, it&#39;s a small army.&quot;
 
&quot;Mmm.&quot;
 
Mireille looked down thoughtfully for a second or two, then turned back 
to Kirika, &quot;Well... He didn&#39;t say anything about her not having 
visitors, right?&quot;
 
&quot;Mmm,&quot; the Japanese guard muttered as Robin Hino now clamored into the 
room and rushed past the two guards to sweep the lovely Maid Usagi into 
her arms.
 
&quot;Okay,&quot; the blonde guard said as she addressed the rest of the Merry 
Women who were now entering the room, &quot;You can come in and visit, but 
Maid Usagi has to stay here until...&quot; she was broke off by Mina-a-Dale 
and her musical spoons.
 
......
 
Oh tonight at ye olde tavern we&#39;ll celebrate Usagi&#39;s rescue,
 
Drinking the ale straight from the kegs.
 
And later tonight, within the bedroom,
 
Rei will part Usagi&#39;s legs.
 
......
 
&quot;That&#39;s it!&quot; Little Mako shouted as she grabbed the spoons away from 
Mina.
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; the minstrel shouted, &quot;Give those back!&quot;
 
&quot;You,&quot; Friar Tenoh&#39;s voice boomed, &quot;Go stand in that corner and say ten 
&#39;Hail Marys&#39; for your lewd songs. And if you get this series bumped up 
to the mature section, I&#39;ll add five &#39;Our Fathers&#39; onto your penance!&quot;
 
Mina slinked off into the corner of the room as Robin Hino continued to 
hold the tearful Maid Usagi in her arms. She placed her index finger 
under the blonde&#39;s chin, tilting her face up so they were looking into 
each other&#39;s loving eyes. Their lips touched tenderly as a heavy set of 
footsteps were heard coming up the stairs.
 
&quot;What is all that racket?&quot; Mamoru&#39;s voice yelled out, &quot;It sounded like 
someone was playing the spoons up here, I...&quot; his voice died out as he 
saw the group in the room. Spotting his hated rival Robin Hino, he 
whipped out his broadsword from its scabbard. Rei did the same, and soon 
the two were engaged in a battle to the death.
 
As Maid Usagi and the others looked on, the tyrannical Sheriff of 
Nottingham forced Robin Hino back against the open stone window. He 
lunged forward, and the gallant outlaw ducked just in time for him to 
miss. Sadly, his momentum caused him to fall out the window to his 
death.
 
The two guards, who were watching silently from the sidelines, now came 
forward.
 
&quot;You just killed our boss,&quot; Mireille said.
 
&quot;Mmm,&quot; Kirika added.
 
&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Ami Scarlett muttered.
 
&quot;Look,&quot; Friar Tenoh said, &quot;Tell you two what; we&#39;ll just leave now with 
Maid Usagi, and you two can...&quot;
 
&quot;Not so fast,&quot; the blonde guard said as she and her partner pulled their 
swords out, &quot;We&#39;re not supposed to let her leave until the Sheriff comes 
for her.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, he did just come for her,&quot; Sister Michiru pointed out, the arrow 
in her chest still sticking out with Maid Usagi&#39;s note attached to it.
 
&quot;Oh...&quot; the Corsican said, &quot;Okay, go ahead then.&quot;
 
&quot;No, wait,&quot; the Japanese guard broke in, &quot;Did he come in to get her, or 
did he come in to fight Robin Hino?&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ve an idea.&quot; Little Mako chimed in, &quot;Why don&#39;t the two of you go 
outside and ask him?&quot;
 
Both guards seemed to like the idea, and promptly left the room in 
search of their boss who was currently lying dead in the front yard of 
the castle. In the meantime, Robin Hino and her Merry Women left with 
Maid Usagi, and all lived happily ever after.

for those who don&#39;t know, Mireille and Kirika are the two main
