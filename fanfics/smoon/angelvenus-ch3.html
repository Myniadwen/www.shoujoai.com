<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Two weeks came and went, and Mitsuki gradually settled into life with 
the Tsukino family. Usagi and Mitsuki seemed to have rather good effects 
on each other; Usagi urged the quieter girl to speak up more often, and 
Mitsuki made sure that Usagi was punctual. It seemed, so far, to be a 
very good arrangement.

&quot;Eeek! Mitsuki, don&#39;t eat all the pancakes!&quot;

&quot;Sorry...it&#39;s just...really good.&quot;

Though, sometimes, everyone has disagreements.

where does this ocean go?

&quot;The sun is casting shadows

an afternoon is fading

I ask, but no one knows

the answer to the question

my life is like an island

where does this ocean go?&quot;

Yoko Kanno/Troy, Where Does This Ocean Go?


&quot;Keep an eye on her. That is all I can tell you.&quot; Setsuna set her teacup 
down. &quot;You know I am not allowed to reveal the things that will come to 
pass.&quot;

&quot;Can we at least get a hint?&quot; Haruka asked, smiling rakishly at the 
stoic time guardian. Setsuna stirred her tea with her index finger and 
shook her head.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;No, Haruka. As much as I would like to tell you more about that girl, I 
cannot. Besides, the vision was hazy; I&#39;m not quite sure what it meant 
myself. It was just...very odd. Surreal, eerie. It made me uneasy.&quot;

&quot;Setsuna, might you at least be able to tell us what you saw?&quot; Michiru 
asked softly, gazing at the older woman.

Setsuna sighed, closed her eyes, and frowned. &quot;A woman. She was cradling 
a child...but...there was something wrong about it.&quot;

&quot;Wrong?&quot; Haruka asked. Setsuna looked almost queasy for a moment before 
she responded.

&quot;The woman was surrounded in light, so bright that I could not see her 
face, but the child was swathed in a darkness so great, that it was 
barely visible. It was...very strange. I cannot recall ever having a 
vision of the future that was so...vague. Just...keep an eye on her,&quot; 
she finished tiredly, finishing the rest of her tea.

Haruka and Michiru nodded.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Of course she&#39;s here,&quot; Ririko said irritably, rolling her eyes. &quot;Who 
else could have sent those things against Kazuki and I? Besides, you 
know what she said, right?&quot;

Nami yawned, showing a flash of almost unnoticeable fangs. &quot;Yes, I am 
well aware of that. But if she&#39;s here, why haven&#39;t we seen her?&quot; Well 
manicured nails tapped against the desk as she thought.

&quot;You&#39;re so dumb,&quot; Ririko growled, regressing back to her teenage years 
for a moment. &quot;She&#39;s hiding, of course. Don&#39;t you know anything?&quot;

&quot;I was sheltered,&quot; Nami replied dryly. &quot;Forgive me. But how, little 
one...&quot;

&quot;If you call me that one more time...&quot; Ririko warned, bright blue eyes 
glittering with a flicker of fire. Nami continued, ignoring her.

&quot;How do we lure her out?&quot;

Ririko frowned in thought, twirling a strand of bright red hair around 
her finger. &quot;Well...if she gave us the right information...&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot;

&quot;Then the best way to lure her out...is to cause some trouble.&quot;

Nami blinked in confusion. &quot;Well...if you say so...causing trouble...&quot; 
the brown-skinned girl grinned suddenly, and Ririko gave her a wary 
look.

&quot;What are you thinking of?&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; she began in a slow, easy drawl, &quot;what do I have that these poor 
Earth creatures don&#39;t?&quot;

Ririko blinked, stared at Nami curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

Nami laughed, the sound like silver bells. &quot;Why, my voice, of course. If 
I sing, then they will come...offering a terrific opportunity to cause 
some mischief. Aren&#39;t you happy you have me around, dear?&quot;

Ririko sighed. She had a bad feeling this wasn&#39;t going to go over well.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Mitsuki walked home with Usagi, watching the snow fall from the sky. 
Usagi sneezed, pushed her scarf up against her mouth.

&quot;It&#39;s so cooold! Man, I can&#39;t wait until...hmm.&quot; The blonde girl stopped 
suddenly, staring around in confusion.

&quot;Do you hear that?&quot;

Mitsuki gazed at her walking companion, and kicked snow off of her 
boots. She listened carefully.

&quot;Something...faint...&quot;

The noise carried over the wind, a soft, sweet song.

&quot;It&#39;s really...nice,&quot; Usagi said. Her cheeks looked flushed, her eyes 
bright. Mitsuki frowned.

&quot;Let&#39;s go see what it is, okay?&quot;

Usagi nodded, practically tugged Mitsuki along with her.

&quot;I bet the others can hear it too. Let&#39;s go.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;The sea, Haruka...&quot;

&quot;What about it?&quot; Haruka&#39;s eyes were glazed, she stared at the woman on 
the stage blankly. Michiru stepped on her foot.

&quot;Ow! What was that-&quot; Michiru covered her mouth.

&quot;Don&#39;t listen to her. She is a child of the sea...but not a very 
friendly one. She&#39;s what we would call a &#39;Siren.&#39;&quot;

Haruka covered her ears. &quot;A Siren? She doesn&#39;t look like the Sirens I&#39;ve 
heard about...&quot;

&quot;Appearances aren&#39;t everything Haruka.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

Michiru sighed, removed Haruka&#39;s hands from her ears. &quot;Appearances 
aren&#39;t everything, I said. I wonder...what is this girl doing here? And 
who is the woman beside her? She doesn&#39;t seem to be affected.&quot; Haruka 
looked at the sullen redhead sitting on the stage, and then at the 
dazed, confused crowd.

&quot;She doesn&#39;t. Maybe these are Mitsuki&#39;s friends?&quot;

&quot;Why would she be making the crowd this way if she was Mitsuki&#39;s 
friend?&quot;

&quot;Setsuna did tell us to keep an eye on her...and speak of the devil...&quot; 
she motioned to Usagi coming toward the crowd quickly, tugging Mitsuki 
behind her. As soon as the two women on the stage caught a glimpse of 
the white-haired girl, they seemed to freeze. The singer stopped, 
laughed.

&quot;Why, looks like it&#39;s our guest of honor! Ririko, usher these people out 
now,&quot; she winked, &quot;Show&#39;s over folks!&quot; Groans issued from the group.

Mitsuki stared at the two women on the stage, and pulled away from 
Usagi&#39;s grasp, running toward them. Usagi blinked, and then ran after 
her, pushing through the crowd. Haruka shrugged.

&quot;Guess they are her friends.&quot; Michiru&#39;s eyes narrowed.

&quot;That Siren is not here to play nice.&quot; The crowd had thinned, and now 
only the three Senshi and Mitsuki remained. Mitsuki scrambled up to the 
stage, and gawked at the two women.

&quot;You two...what are you doing here? Did you come to rescue me?&quot;

Nami smiled serenely, and the wind blew, the air lightly hinted with the 
smell of the sea.

&quot;Something like that,&quot; she said. She grinned, and her eyes glowed like 
that of a cat&#39;s.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Terrific. Send Dumb and Dumber to do the job.&quot; The woman sneered, jade 
eyes glinting with poorly veiled disdain.

&quot;You could have stayed, Kazuki, and offered your assistance. Nami and 
Ririko will be alright though; they are fine warriors.&quot; The second woman 
smiled, sipped her tea.

&quot;Besides...the time will come where I will have to step in.&quot; She gave 
Kazuki a sad, tired smile, and walked off. </pre>
