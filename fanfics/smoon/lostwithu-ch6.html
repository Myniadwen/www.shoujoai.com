</strong>
</p><strong>Author's notes: </strong>Writing  it, at the beginning, I feared this chapter would have ended up too  short... obviously it ended up too long... I hope you have enough  patience to read it entirely. I know maybe it's obvious but I wanted to  warn that the flashbacks aren't in cronological succession.
<p>Well... it's time to read... it will be a long one guys!</p>

<strong>Tokyo airport 9.18</strong>
<p><em>&quot;Here  is your outward ticket, is flight 5186 and it'll board at gate 23 at  ten o'clock.&quot; The clerk lent the ticket-envelope to the handsome  customer.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Thank you.&quot; The tall blonde took the envelope  while the clerk was typing on her keyboard again, after a minute she  looked up with an awkward expression on her face.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm  sorry, your previous reservation were in a roundtrip packet,  Tenoh-san... so you had lost the backward seat too.&quot; Just like she had  thought the tall blonde was less than happy for the news. She heard her  cursing under her breath and she tried again to see if she could fix  the situation someway. After 5 five minutes the blonde in front of her  was fuming.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;This is ridiculous! That moron of a cab  driver had made me loose two flights in just one day!&quot; The tall blonde  was furious, the handsome smooth face twisted in a mask of annoyance.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm  very sorry... But you have your outward ticket... I'm sure you'll find  a ticket for you to return before the end of next week...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You're  not getting it, are you? I have no intention of spending one damn night  more than necessary in New York!&quot; The blonde was yelling at the  embarrassed clerk. Soon Haruka realized she had snapped badly at the  helpless young woman. She calmed her demeanor though inside she was  enraged and frustrated beyond limits.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm sorry...?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh... Hiyama Manami, Tenoh-san.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hiyama-san,  please excuse my behavior,&quot; Haruka decided to change strategy, she took  off her dark sunglasses and shot an intense look with her penetrating  teal eyes to the poor woman... &quot;I'm unpardonable, treating a beautiful  lady like you so rudely, I know...&quot; ...a captivating smile... &quot;...but  I'm sure that if you want forgive me and search again you can find a  little seat for me on a flight back to Tokyo before the end of </em>this<em> week.&quot; ...and </em></p>
<em>the  charm had been cast, the poor clerk blushed furiously and within  minutes Haruka had her backward ticket that would have brought her back  to Tokyo in less than 72 hours and the young clerk had red tinged  cheeks and her heart was beating wildly.

</p>
<p><strong>In the middle of the Ocean, 69 hours later.</strong></p>
<p>Dawn  was tingeing the horizon of gold, an insistent breeze was rippling the  sea's surface and the waves broke to the shore relentlessly. Haruka was  walking on the cool white sand after a long run. Everyone was still  sleeping at the beach, the day has still to start and the night was  about to finish. It had been a sleepless night – the <em>third</em> sleepless night, to be exact. She had tried to lay down – she felt so  tired - but sleep came after hours and went away soon cause of a  disturbing nightmare. In the end she had found herself running, like  always. She had tried to calm down with a relieving run and had ended  up in a secluded little beach where the dawn's scene was even more  enchanting than it was where they had their camp.</p>
<p>Now the sun had  broke out through the horizon line in all its red glory and she decided  to return to the camp, they had planned another hunting session for the  day and she wanted to participate at least it could have been a good  way to keep herself occupied.</p>
<p>Returning to the camp with her  shoes in her hand she noticed someone else was awake and judging by his  fidgety movements and his bloodshot but sparkling eyes he had had a  sleepless night too.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning Haruka-san.&quot; He smiled at the approaching woman.</p>
<p>&quot;Good  morning Furuhata-kun.&quot; She greeted him. Noticing his bad controlled  excitement she smiled amused. &quot;It seems a very good morning judging by  your face.&quot; She pointed out with the result that the young man couldn't  keep himself anymore and beamed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah, it's going to be a very good morning!&quot; He nodded.</p>
<p>&quot;If  you say so...&quot; She smiled skeptic but amused and was about to walk on  when Furuhata couldn't keep himself from telling Haruka the amazing  news. &quot;Haruka-san! Wait... you don't know what has happened last night  after the service! It's wonderful!&quot; Haruka had a questioning look at  first then an annoying thought flashed through her mind.</p>
<p>'Please  no... this is gonna be a bad blow if he had seen-...' She hadn't the  time to finish her thought that the young technician explained  enthusiastically why he was so excited.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw a plane last night, flying over us!&quot;</p>
<p>'Great!  He had seen it!' Haruka's exterior behavior was one less cynic but  inwardly it was otherwise cause during her life she had learned not to  have too high expectations especially when it was up to others than  herself to save the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw it too, actually, but I don't-...&quot; He cut her off excited.</p>
<p>&quot;Really? I can't wait to tell everyone the news-...&quot; This time was Haruka who interrupted the joyous speech.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!  Wait Furuhata-kun, do you think this is a good idea?&quot; He looked at her  with a very confused expression, &quot;What if the plane hadn't noticed the  fire? You don't want to delude all of those persons, do you?&quot; The young  man looked up at her thinking for a moment.</p>
<p>&quot;But Haruka-san...  they do need good news! They all were so sad after the service,  yesterday...&quot; His expression fell at the thought of the tears he had  seen run down many cheeks the previous night and at the heavy silence  that had followed the small ceremony.</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah they were sad, but  think how they'll be if no one comes.&quot; She reasoned, her dark-circled  and bloodshot eyes pierced through him. Furuhata kept eye-contact with  her until he had to admit first to himself then to her she was right.</p>
<p>Haruka  thought he seemed truly disappointed and sorry about not being able to  share his happiness and hope and even if his mind-attitude was so often  completely different from hers she had already a soft spot for that man  full of faith in people. Something she hadn't been able to have...  faith.</p>
<p>At this thought her mind went back to the previous night  and the whispered conversation she had had with Michiru. She lifted her  hand to her neck and touched the smooth cold surface of the gold cross  attached to the necklace.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;What is this?&quot; Haruka demanded eyeing the small wooden box with suspicion.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Open  it, I guarantee you it doesn't bite.&quot; The gray-haired woman smiled and  her wrinkled face lighten up. The serious looking, fifteen-years-old,  blonde girl lifted the box's lid, inside there was a golden thin  necklace with a smooth cross attached to it. She examined the item for  a minute then lifted her head and looked at her grandmother  questioningly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Did you really thought you could come here  and say good-bye to your old granny this easily?&quot; The old woman smiled  knowingly to her precocious granddaughter.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;But Granny I-...&quot; The teal-eyed woman cut her off.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh, come on Haruka! I know what are you going to do, and I know it'll pass a long long time before I can see you again.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The  blonde girl dropped her look guiltily, she had intended their encounter  to be as normal as possible. She had decided not to tell her  grandmother that she was about to leave New York to live in Tokyo, she  had been sure the old woman couldn't bare the thought of loosing her  only granddaughter after having lost her daughter just one year ago.  And most of all Haruka hated moments of parting.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Granny  I...&quot; But she couldn't finish her sentence, her voice trailed off. The  older woman got up from her armchair and went beside her granddaughter.  She circled her shoulders with a thin old arm, the teen was already  taller than her grandmother and promised to become even taller, maybe  taller then her own father.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey... I'm not saying I won't  miss you, honey, but I know you have to do it.&quot; The understanding words  didn't quiet the storming feelings swirling inside her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Really  you do?&quot; The unsure tone made suddenly look the usually confident and  mature girl like a kid needing reassurance... and after all she was  just like that.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Of course I do, Splinter. Still I can't understand why you have to change continent... but I'm sure you have your reasons.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Are you going to accept my little present or not?&quot; The old woman changed the subject trying to maintain a nonchalant demeanor.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Ehm...  you know I don't... ehm... I don't believe...&quot; Haruka mumbled quite  embarrassed. Her grandmother's religiousness had always made her feel  weird, something always kept her from understanding such things, but  she loved her very much and had always indulged. But that last year  things had changed a lot and Haruka had found more and more difficult  to come to terms to anything and anyone even her beloved Granny.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka  honey, you have chosen a pretty hard path and God wasn't too soft on  you either. Your life is going to be tough and someday you'll need some  faith...&quot; as Haruka tried to protest her grandmother squeezed softly  her arm to silence her and continued, &quot;I know, I know... honey, I don't  care if you'll have faith in God, destiny or just in another human  being, but I know for sure you'll need it, cause no one can be  self-sufficient for ever.&quot;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>&quot;I don't need anybody.&quot; This time the girl's tone was resolute and hard, someway unfitting a girl her age.

</p>
<p>GASP!</p>
<p>Heavy panting could be heard as a shadowed figure jumped up in a sitting position on a makeshift pallet.</p>
<p>Turning  to both sides Rei could see how her grandfather and Yuiichiro were  still asleep, seemingly undisturbed. Relieved by the fact that she  wouldn't have to give explanations the young miko concentrated on her  just interrupted dream.</p>
<p>The suffocating sensation of the bars  against her chest was still vivid and a shiver run down her spine at  the memory of the cries of terror behind her.</p>
<p>In her dream she  was – all of them were, to be exact – locked in a big wide cage, she  had been able to reach the railings and was gripping it pulling and  pushing in a desperate and quite futile attempt to break it and escape.  Meanwhile, behind her back, a dreadful roar became nearer and nearer.  Then cries of pain and noise of ripping flesh joined other cries of  pure terror.</p>
<p>Since she was a teenager Rei had learnt such dreams  were something more than mere nightmares, something terrible was on  that island and its evil nature was becoming harder and harder to deny  and ignore for her. She had heard the tales about what had happened to  the people in the cockpit and she had started to have weird visions  since they had had the accident.</p>
<p>The sun was rising and her inner  turmoil made sleeping again impossible so she got up as silently as  possible. Tiptoeing between Yuiichiro and her grandfather's asleep  figures she reached the pile of clothes they had picked up from the  passengers' belongings and put on a white T-shirt and red shorts. She  walked off heading to the shore in a secluded spot near the camp.</p>
<p>During  her journey to the peaceful place she had chosen for her meditation she  met Furuhata heading the opposite way. His 'good-morning' was joined by  his usual kind smile which however faded abruptly. It had seemed like  he had wanted to tell her something but had changed his mind all of a  sudden. It had been weird, he had remained open-mouthed for a minute  stopping in front of her then he had walked off without any other word.</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged at the odd behavior and proceed her walk, after a minute or so  she realized someone was on the shore in the distance. As she neared  she noticed the figure was discarding their shoes and then run into the  sea.</p>
<p>The black-haired girl realized what was going on and hurried  to the shore, the insistent wind was making the sea choppy and they had  already experienced how the currents were strong and unpredictable.  They had seen debris pulled off the coast in just a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>When  she reached the shore she entered the sea with her feet and started  calling out for whoever was now swimming off among the chaotic,  white-crested waves. Suddenly the figure stopped and turned around then  they dived under the surface remerging after a couple of dozens of  seconds. That happened several times and then it was clear that they  were looking for something... or someone.</p>
<p>Probably drawn by Rei's  yelling Furuhata came back running, Rei explained him the situation and  he told her it had to be Haruka cause he had just left her there a  short while ago. Then the dark blonde man dived and swam off to where  the figure was still searching. From the shore Rei watched as Furuhata  reached the figure and seemed talking then he dived under the surface a  couple of times too, then there was a quite animated discussion. After  that the two seemed to swim back to the coast.</p>
<p>Once they reached  the shore Rei helped them out mainly a seemingly exhausted and very  agitated Haruka. The tall woman kept telling she had seen someone  drowning and that it had seemed to be the blonde pigtailed American  girl, Serena. On the other hand Furuhata said he had seen no one and  that the current was very strong and that they had had to come back not  to be pulled down and off by the undertow.</p>
<p>Rei was very confused,  'It isn't possible.' She had passed by Serena and her friends' place at  the camp in her trip to the shore and the girl had been soundly asleep  in her handsome boyfriend's arms. Then Rei noticed Haruka's feverish  look and a shiver run down her spine at the same sensation she  remembered from her dream.</p>
<p>For several minutes they kept scanning  the waves to be sure nobody was there. Haruka couldn't get the image of  the pigtailed girl floating helpless among the waves off her mind. She  had been so sure of what she had seen just minutes before, but now, sat  on the sand between Furuhata and Rei, regaining her breath after the  run and the swim, it seemed all blurred and muddled in her head. She  kept shaking her head in the vain attempt to clear her mind.</p>
<p>Rei watched the older woman for a moment as she shook her head and massaged absentmindedly her left shoulder.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-san,  are you alright?&quot; She said in a low voice. The blonde car-racer turned  to her and seemed to come back from her hazed state blinking.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh...  Yes, yes, of course.&quot; But Rei thought she seemed everything but  alright, she was pale though the physical exertion just done, her eyes  were blood-shot and she had started shivering badly.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on,  Haruka-san, the wind is cold and you have to take off those wet  clothes... You too Furuhata-san.&quot; She gestured for them to get up and  follow her to the camp.</p>
<p>They walked in silence at first on the  sand, then through a small group of trees and bushes, Haruka was cold,  very cold, her wet tank-top stuck against her thin frame, her own arms  tightened around her torso to defend herself from the chilling wind.  When they reemerged from the small wood at the West end of the beach  where the camp was Haruka lifted her eyes and blinked at the now raised  sun. Just then she had a glimpse of a dark clothed figure at the tree  line, she didn't pay attention to it at first but when she realized it  was someone she couldn't recognize as one of the survivors she looked  at that spot again... it was empty. Wanting to scan the distance if she  could locate it again she stopped abruptly with the result of Furuhata  bumping into her and the two of them stumbling.</p>
<p>&quot;Is something  wrong, Haruka-san?&quot; He asked but she didn't answer she was looking in  the distance and seemed to not notice the technician's presence. She  scanned along the whole tree line but no one was there and after a  minute she hurried behind Rei. Furuhata shrugged and followed her in  silence.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Haruka!&quot;  Her name yelled that way promised nothing good especially cause his  father wasn't supposed to be home yet. Usually he hanged at the Country  Club after his working until seven when he came home for dinner,  particularly since her mother had died - almost a year before – he  seemed to stay at home less and less. But today he was home at five o'  clock in the afternoon.</em>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka, damn it come down!&quot; She was  upstairs in her room doing her homework after track training but she  had been able to hear clearly him calling her. She was thinking what  could have made him so mad at her when a timid knock on the door  distracted her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Miss Tenoh, your father wants you  downstairs.&quot; The timid voice from behind her room's door was the  housemaid's and judging by the tremble in it her father had to be  really pissed.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm coming Miss Grossman, thank you.&quot; She closed her algebra book and got up still thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>'What  have I done now?' Sure she had never been what they call 'an angelic  child' but in the last month she hadn't been in any trouble in class  nor at the track, her grades were good as always - with the exception  of modern English, of course - so she couldn't understand her father's  anger.</em></p>
<p><em>But as she was descending the big main stairs and  could see the disgusted look in her father's dark eyes she thought she  had understood why he was so mad.</em></p>
<p><em>'No... please no!' There  was just one thing that could bring such expression on his face. She  had seen it many times, whenever some 'fag or dyke' was implied...  'Please...' Her inner prayer became feebler and feebler as she  descended the marble steps.</em></p>
<p><em>Her father's eyes were burning  of barely restrained fury, he stood in the big foyer with his elegant  dark suit and his briefcase at his feet, apparently dropped without  much gentleness. He sure could look menacing, he was taller than the  average of Japanese men and fairly well-built, but what made him  slightly scaring was the hard expression on his face and the icy cold  tone of his baritone voice.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Henry Ryan came to my office today.&quot; His look was piercing through her.</em></p>
<p><em>'No...'  The worst had happened, the one thing she had so scrupulously tried to  hid from him had been found out and now she couldn't imagine what would  have happened. Surely nothing good. </em></p>
<p><em>He didn't wait for  an answer, he wasn't expecting one anyway. &quot;He told me you've done  something to her daughter-...&quot; At this words Haruka couldn't hold  herself, she had done a lot of things she was sure her father wouldn't  be happy of but she had never done anything bad to Isabel Ryan, she  couldn't have, no sir... she loved Isabel.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Father, I di-...&quot; Her forceful protest was cut off by the full raged voice of her parent.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Don't dare interrupt me, girl!&quot; He snapped.</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka  knew better than disobey so she just descended the last two steps and  stood there in front of him with her hands in her pockets and the head  bowed down. When he spoke again his voice was low again but the tone  was even scarier.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He said that you seduced her and took  advantage of her.&quot; He paused and his eyes pierced through her more  intensely. &quot;Is it the truth?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The answer to that question  was simple, 'Of course not!' She hadn't took advantage of Isabel, yes  she had seduced her and she had been seduced by her too. But no one had  took advantage of anyone. But she knew too well that wasn't the kind of  answer her father wanted to hear.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I asked you a  question.&quot; His statement was menacing, he wasn't renowned for his big  patience – in that they were so similar, her mother used to tell her  all the time – and now it seemed about to fade anytime very soon.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I...&quot;  She couldn't answer... couldn't. Her mother had thought her not to  betray herself, but she had also told her there were things his father  better not to know... </em></p>
<p><em>She hadn't had to decide about what answer give to him cause he didn't wait for one again...</em></p>
<p><em>The slap came unexpected, she stumbled and fell back at the foot of the stairs.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  want you out of this house in one week. Tomorrow you'll choose a  boarding-school. I don't care which one or where. I don't want people  to say my daughter doesn't have an education.&quot; The cold rage in his  voice felt like a blade cutting through her, it hurt more than the  throbbing of her face. He had never hit her before. &quot;Till then you're  not allowed to see that girl again.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>She was petrified,  not by fear but cause of the implications of what he had just said.  When she realized he wasn't going to say anything else she stood up.  Her head spinning and crimson blood dripping from her nose to her  shirt. As she got up he remained there staring at her, his eyes cold.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>&quot;You're  disgusting!&quot; He spat. At those words she didn't bowed her head in  shame, no... She stared him back proudly, her eyes as cold as his, or  even more. She didn't say anything to him then, for once she held back  her temper, but inwardly she swore to herself from then on he would be  like dead for her.

<p><em>Subject  A has to be put in the cage 5 days before putting in the guinea pigs to  see if it feeds on the local fauna or if it starves. The cage has to  contain means of sustenance for the guinea pigs to offer a fair  competition for life. They have to be capable to represent a challenge  to test the subject's strength and abilities...</em></p>
<p>'Why had he  highlighted this passage? And why this numbers?' Setsuna thought as she  re-read for the umpteenth time that page of dr. Tomoe's notes. She  wanted to understand the meaning of the numbers written in red near the  highlighted '5 days' words. She had understood a sizable portion of  those notes, sure she wasn't a geneticist nor a biologist but she was a  scientist nonetheless and the main part was someway intelligible for  her, but those numbers...</p>
<p>'04... 16... and 04... 21... what's  their meaning? And there's even an exclamation point near the 21...'  She gave a moan of frustration, when she realized that she looked  beside her to see if she had woken little Hotaru but fortunately the  girl seemed still soundly asleep.</p>
<p>'Come on Setsuna maybe it's a  code and there's no way to decipher it... or maybe it's just some kind  of numerical cataloguing.' She reasoned with herself as she looked  around. The sun was about to lighten the rest of the beach too and soon  the daily life of their little community would begin. She stared for a  moment at Haruka's empty pallet and thought how long the blonde could  go on without sleep before falling apart. Right then she heard soft  noise from behind her and when she turned she saw a dripping wet Haruka  walking slowly. She could see the blonde shivering at the blowing  breeze.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey... what's happen-...?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nothing!&quot; The trembling car-racer cut off her question rudely.</p>
<p>&quot;Ok...&quot;  Setsuna stood in silence, walked to their clothes and picked up a pair  of jeans and a long-sleeved rugby shirt. She then lent them to the  trembling blonde who mumbled a 'thank you' without bother to look her  in the eyes. Haruka wore the dry clothes and sat down without a single  word. Setsuna realized immediately she was in a very bad mood and  though she had always managed to hold off the blonde's temper she  didn't want to push her fortune, so she returned to Souchi Tomoe's  notes while the stubborn car-racer sat in silence.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
A  hour later Setsuna got up from her sitting spot to go picking something  to eat and their - by then - poor ration of water. She moved the first  steps when she had an idea so she stopped and turned.
<p>&quot;Haruka-san, come with me... please?&quot; She added at the questioning look by the car-racer.</p>
<p>Haruka turned and her eyes went to Hotaru's sleeping form, she looked back at Setsuna and the tanned woman smiled softly.</p>
<p>&quot;She'll  be ok.&quot; Haruka then got up and followed Setsuna towards the doctor's  tent's rear where their rations were. When they were far enough to not  risking waking little Hotaru Setsuna had to make up an excuse for  having made Haruka go with her.</p>
<p>&quot;I checked Dr. Tomoe's notes.&quot;  She stated and watched as her plan succeeded cause Haruka's bloodshot  eyes lighten with curiosity. &quot;It looks like he was a geneticist and he  was working on a project about some animal DNA manipulation...&quot; Haruka  started to protest about the point of all that so Setsuna explained,  &quot;But... in his notes there were specification about his previous  tickets reservations... I know you don't think it's important but I <em>feel</em> something's terribly wrong... for instance why they haven't come to rescue us yet?&quot; She said in a calm but firm tone.</p>
<p>At those words Haruka started for a second... and her attentive interlocutor didn't fail to notice it.</p>
<p>Inwardly  the blonde was thinking Setsuna, though the calm and controlled  demeanor, was trying to give some sort of sense to the entire situation  in a sort of extremely rational delusion... Haruka knew why and wasn't  some mysterious reason it was very simple... the pilot had told her and  Furuhata.</p>
<p>'But you want to believe she's right, admit it!' The  annoying inner voice had returned and she couldn't restrain a  frustrated grunt that made Setsuna rise her eyebrows. 'Yes... you want  to believe Furuhata is right even more...'</p>
<p>&quot;Well... I don't have much to do all day so I can <em>enjoy </em>checking  some dead scientist genius' ravings about plane reservations and bears'  DNA.&quot; Her smile was knowing while she walked on the rapidly warming  sand, Haruka was engaged in an inner debate with her conscience and  didn't noticed it. &quot;You didn't answer my question by the way, what's  keeping them from rescuing us, in your opinion?&quot; Setsuna's insistence  was welcomed by Haruka who had to keep her mind busy searching for an  answer, taking her mind away from the disturbing inner dialogue.</p>
<p>&quot;I... I don't know... maybe they're going to come.&quot; She mumbled lacking a better convincing reply.</p>
<p>Setsuna smiled again, &quot;Oh Haruka-san I didn't think you were one to have such faith in destiny.&quot; She noticed almost incredulous.</p>
<p>Haruka  looked at her about to protest then she thought better not wanting to  stress the subject further on, she felt she wasn't in the mental  condition to engage in a risking conversation with that woman.</p>
<p>They  reached the doctor's tent and entered after having announced their  presence. Once inside they were greeted by Dr. Mizuno who was arranging  all the stuff they had recovered from the plane, she had made them take  all the oxygen masks cause she had said the tubes could be useful.</p>
<p>&quot;Good  morning Meioh-san, Haruka-san...&quot; She bowed, frowning at Haruka, then  she accompanied them out in the rear. &quot;Please help yourself.&quot; She said  in an exaggerated tone opening the water-box to show them the  incredibly scarce number of little bottles still full. She already knew  why they had come.</p>
<p>&quot;So that's it then...&quot; Was Setsuna's laconic  comment. The blue-haired doctor nodded sighing in resignation.  Meanwhile Haruka was staring at the tree line behind them, they  realized that and turned to look what had captured her attention but  they couldn't see anything. When turned back she had walked off without  a single word. They kept watching her as her steps turned in a slight  run. They were joined by Ami who had their same confused expression on  her face having been just passed by a running Haruka who didn't even  said a simple 'hello'.</p>
<p>Mother and daughter exchanged a worried look then the older woman turned to Setsuna who seemed equally if not more concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;Has  she managed to get some sleep...? She does not look good at all.&quot; The  doctor asked. Setsuna shook her head remaining silent. Dr. Mizuno  nodded knowingly, &quot;I see...&quot;</p>
<p>Ami had turned again watching Haruka disappearing through the first rows of trees.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When  Haruka caught a glimpse of the standing, dark-clothed figure in the  distance she locked her eyes on it not to let it disappeared like the  previous time. The other were commenting about the water supply but she  was no more listening. The figure seemed a man and he didn't looked  like anyone of the survivors. There was someone else on the island?  Were Setsuna's suspicions about something mysterious going on true?
<p>She decided to clear things out, so she left the small group and walked to the mysterious figure at a steady pace. When her <em>target</em> turned to enter the wood she broke in a run. Soon she was where he had  been just seconds before. She stopped not knowing where to go and  looked around anxiously. There was no trace of the man, when she was  about to loose her hope of finding him she had a glimpse of his dark  suit on her right and soon run to him in a frenzy.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; She yelled but he didn't look behind to her nor he stopped.</p>
<p>Haruka run and run and even if the mysterious man was just walking he seemed always to be ahead enough not to be reached.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; She yelled again and redoubled her effort in her run.</p>
<p>She  was already panting, her lungs hurt but she wasn't any closer to him.  Her body was protesting in all ways possible but she seemed to have no  intention in giving up.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait, damn it!&quot; She kept yelling. She  wasn't even paying attention on where she was heading and soon she lost  any idea of her own location.</p>
<p>But right then it didn't matter to  her... nothing mattered to her. Nothing but that man who was stubbornly  eluding her. No matter how fast she run, no matter how loud she yelled  he was always ahead of her.</p>
<p>But suddenly she stopped, she stopped so abruptly that she stumbled, she steadied herself against a trunk shaking her head.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm  going crazy... I'm going crazy...&quot; She murmured between heavy pants and  looking straight forward where, a dozen of meters from her, stood her  father.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The main part of  the little community was gathered at the meeting point, Rei's  grandfather had suggested placing traps for the warthogs in the woods  so the hunting sessions would be less dangerous, he had worked on some  traps with sticks and ropes and had planned the placing. Some of the  survivors had volunteered to be those who placed them with Grandpa –  that was the old man's nickname for almost everyone by then – and were  getting ready for the little expedition.
<p>They had thought it was  better if the group was as small as possible to not have to use too  much water, so they had previously decided just Yuiichiro, Seiya and  Haruka to go. Particularly Seiya had insisted that same morning on  going, he didn't want people – especially Haruka – to think he was  afraid after the little misadventure he had had the last time.</p>
<p>Also,  Michiru thought, he wanted to keep himself off the thought of what had  happened between his brothers and him the previous day. The young  violinist had objected it wasn't a rational thing, the wound in his leg  was just starting to heal up but he had insisted and she had had to  give up.</p>
<p>Now they had just joined the others, Michiru had her arm  under Seiya's and he looked confident like always, though he had passed  the main part of the night talking with Michiru about his problems in  an intense and dramatic confession. The result had been that Michiru  hadn't rejected him like he had feared... no, she had been very  understanding and had offered him her support for then and for the  future. When he had woken that morning he had felt a renewed energy in  him, sure for the fact that he had the heavy burden off his shoulder  and cause he felt he was closer to Michiru.</p>
<p>With his patented  smile he greeted everyone starting with Serena and Mina who seemed very  pleased of the attention. The polite 'good-morning' exchanged by the  three Kou brothers was instead quite cold and awkward. This didn't seem  to affect the dark-haired man's mood but Michiru thought it could be  just a pose. Taiki seemed sorry about the situation though he didn't do  anything to talk to Seiya. Yaten on the other hand seemed the more  upset, he just mumbled his greeting and did not just ignored Seiya but  Michiru too. She was sorry about that but she could understand him too.  When Taiki noticed it he approached her and apologized for his  brother's behavior.</p>
<p>In a couple of minutes they were ready except  for Haruka who was nowhere to be seen. Michiru was slightly worried, it  wasn't like Haruka at all to not fulfill a commitment taken on, or at  least such thing had never happened the previous days. Michiru was sure  Haruka was the kind of person who's too proud to neglect her promises,  so she looked around expecting to see the tall blonde walking there,  but it never happened. When they were deciding about waiting for her or  not Michiru saw an odd look-exchange between Rei and Furuhata. She  frowned and when Rei made eye-contact with her frown she looked away  and made a step forward.</p>
<p>&quot;Well... I think Haruka-san is not  coming...&quot; Everyone noticed her hesitation and curiosity spread among  the group, at this point Furuhata had the spirit to intervene, he  thought Haruka wouldn't have appreciate such intrusiveness by all of  them.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, I met her this morning and asked her if she could  help me with the radio, I convinced her cause we knew there were other  volunteers for the hunt. She'll made an inspection for me so we can  decide where to place the boosters...&quot; When he realized a bunch of  confused eyes were on him, he sweatdropped and scratching the back of  his head in embarrassment quickly added, &quot;Well... it's kinda of a  complicated thing... I'll fill you in when we're ready...&quot; Some of them  sighed in relief and most of them seemed happy with Furuhata's  explanation of Haruka's absence.</p>
<p>Michiru wasn't one of them. She  was about to go to Rei to ask for a real explanation but Seiya pulled  her arm slightly preventing her from disentangle.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Michiru-chan where are you going?&quot; He asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&quot;I...&quot;  Michiru was taken aback, her mind was racing through possible  explanations for Haruka's non-attendance she wasn't prepared for  Seiya's simple question.</p>
<p>&quot;Aren't you going to say good-bye to the hunters?&quot; He joked, she recompose herself and smiled at him.</p>
<p>&quot;Of  course, in fact I was just about to come and wish good luck to  Grandpa-san and Yuiichiro-kun...&quot; She winked at him then giggled at his  pouting.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, your words hurt!&quot; He said in an exaggerated tone  and lifted his hands to his heart like he had been stabbed, then  laughed and Michiru laughed too. Then she put a hand on his shoulder in  a sweet gesture and wished him good luck.</p>
<p>&quot;Take care-...&quot; She  gasped when he leant forward and embraced her tightly, after the first  seconds of surprise she get accustomed to his body's touch, relaxed and  embraced him back.</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you.&quot; He whispered and she never knew it was for her behavior the previous night or for the embrace.</p>
<p>As  the three hunters had walked off Michiru headed to Rei but half-way she  changed her mind catching sight of Setsuna walking with Dr. Mizuno. The  tanned woman was the closest to Haruka, except for Hotaru of course,  they shared the same spot on the beach, beside that woman seemed to  know lots of things, even when she wasn't supposed to.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<em>&quot;Moshi moshi?&quot;</em>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka Tenoh?&quot; Asked a female voice in English.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah,  it's Tenoh Haruka speaking, who are you?&quot; Haruka's sleepily answered in  the correct language after a moment of adjusting. It was 3.30 AM and  she had been sleeping soundly after a tiring day of practice at the  race track.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka...&quot; At the other end there were few  seconds of hesitation but Haruka hadn't to repeat the question,  &quot;Haruka, it's Isabel, Isabel Ryan.&quot; </em></p>
<p><em>Haruka remained silent, she was incredulous, after all those years... 'What does she want?' She thought.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka? Are you still there?&quot; The voice from the other end seemed worried.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yes.&quot; Haruka's reply was laconic, she was still surprised of hearing her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well...&quot;  The hesitation was so evident that Haruka thought she could hear the  other pacing, &quot;it's been a while, isn't it?&quot; The words were spoken  quickly, the awkwardness clear.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Twelve years...&quot; The car-racer answered automatically.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah...  How are you? I watch your races all the time...&quot; Isabel's voice turned  from anxious to soft, but Haruka started to get suspicious, it wasn't  normal such thing.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Isabel... stop the small talk, it's  nonsense. What do you want?&quot; Now Haruka was fully awake and that phone  call sounded like something was going on.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka...&quot; But Isabel's voice trailed off without finishing her sentence.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Come  on Isabel, I don't believe you called me in the middle of the night  just to catch up after a dozen of years...&quot; She started to feel annoyed.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I... I'm sorry...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It's a bit too late to feel sorry.&quot; Was the bitter reply.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;You're  right, I know...&quot; She paused again, Haruka was about to protest again  when she continued more firmly, &quot;I know, but I have something to tell  you.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The serious and suddenly firm tone made Haruka sit up in bed and prompting Isabel to continue.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm listening.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  think of you all the time... and I know, since your grandmother had  died, there's no one here you keep in contact with so... I thought I  had to tell you...&quot; She paused a moment to take a deep breath, &quot;I  didn't want a lawyer just wiring you... It's about your father-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I don't want to know anything about him, thank you,&quot; Haruka cut her off coldly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka wait!&quot; Isabel protested, but the car-racer didn't want to listen.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Isabel,  I'm serious. And now... if you want to excuse me it's three AM here and  tomorrow I have work to do...&quot; Haruka was about to hung up when Isabel  spoke.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He's dead, Haruka.&quot; And then the world stopped for a moment... </em></p>
<p><em>...But just for a moment.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I see, thank you for calling, Isabel.&quot; Haruka's voice was so cold that a shiver run down Isabel's spine.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka... please...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What?&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He...  he was your father...&quot; Isabel felt her heart clenching at her former  friend and lover's exterior coldness, she knew the hurt inside was even  greater than the that. Sure Haruka and her father had issues unsolved  and now... '...it'll all resurface full force.'</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I don't  care. Now, thank you again.&quot; She said but she didn't hang up like  Isabel expected and after a minute of silence Isabel spoke again.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It was a heart attack, this morning...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I told you I don't care!&quot; Haruka was now yelling, when she realized that she apologized. &quot;Sorry... I-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The funeral is-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm not going to his funeral!&quot; The car-racer hissed.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;..is the day after tomorrow, you can be here in time-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Are you deaf! I'm not coming!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;...if you can take a flight tomorrow.&quot; Isabel concluded ignoring Haruka's stubborn protests.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I won't come to his damn funeral!&quot; She said again, her voice reduced to a whisper.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Don't  do that to yourself, Haruka...&quot; Isabel was almost pleading, &quot;...you  don't deserve such a burden on your heart. Please, come to his funeral  or it will never end...&quot; She didn't hear any word from the other end  but she could clearly hear heavy breathing. &quot;I'm sorry Haruka.&quot; Isabel  concluded not knowing what else to say then she hung realizing Haruka  would not say anything else.</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka remained there  clenching the telephone with her hand for a couple of minutes, her  knuckles turning white. Then she suddenly throw the unfortunate device  against the wall.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm not going to his damn funeral! I'm  not going! Do you hear me! I WON'T COME TO YOUR FUCKING FUNERAL!&quot; She  shouted to the dark room.</em></p>
<p><em>Then she got up, turn on the  reading lamp on her bedside table and when she had found the telephone  on the floor she checked if it was still working. She dialed and after  a couple of rings a male voice answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hello, I wanted  to book a roundtrip journey to New York... in the morning as soon as  possible... first class... thank you... Tenoh Haruka... yes... that too  as soon as possible... the day after tomorrow... yes yes on 18th it's  ok...&quot;</em></p>
<p>She was panting heavily, her head spinning for the  breakneck speed run, the trees were closely planted and the light  filtering through the foliage was very scarce.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;No...  you can't be...&quot; But shake her head as she might, he wouldn't  disappear. Every time she blinked her tired eyes he remained there just  enough out of reach and close enough to discern his features, to see  the cold expression of his clean-shaven face.
<p>Haruka stood there leant against the rough trunk of a tree, she was staring at her father so intensely that her head throbbed.</p>
<p>&quot;What  are you doing here?&quot; She then murmured, but just as she opened her  mouth he turned and started walking away again. She didn't move  surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait!&quot; The blonde said, but when he didn't stop nor turn she moved away from the tree and resumed her run with great effort.</p>
<p>She  couldn't tell if it was him who had sped up or she was slowing down but  the fact was that he seemed farer and farer and soon she lost his  tracks. Her confused mind was panicking, she stopped and started  turning around feverishly. No trace.</p>
<p>Haruka then started running  in random directions, she never thought she was entering deeper and  deeper into the woods dangerously, nothing mattered anymore. She had to  find her father. She <em>had to</em> find him.</p>
<p>After half an hour  her legs were refusing to run anymore, she was exhausted, her lungs  hurt, her shirt was ripped where she had collided with trunks and  bramble's quills, her limbs ached for the exertion and her shoulder and  head throbbed in dull pain. She collapsed, her back against a tree, and  slumped down to the ground.</p>
<p>It was in such position that a  passing-by Grandpa found her, he walked closer and crouched down even  if it was hardly needed due to his short height.</p>
<p>&quot;Good morning  Haruka-san.&quot; The greeting could have sounded mocking seeing the poor  state she was in, but she didn't thought such thing, she just turned  her head and looked surprised at the old man beside her.</p>
<p>&quot;Good  morning.&quot; She answered then, like everything was perfectly normal. The  old priest sat there beside her and began fumbling with his rucksack  and soon took out a couple of bananas and a small bottle of water. He  offered one fruit to Haruka and when she absently took it he peeled the  other off and bit it.</p>
<p>Haruka was dumbfounded but nonetheless  followed his example and soon she was munching just like him. Another  half a hour passed and they remained there in complete silence, Haruka  had calmed down enough to remember she had completely forgot about the  hunt.</p>
<p>&quot;I was supposed to be with you, wasn't I?&quot; She asked. He  laughed softly then answered with a smile, his small eyes reduced to  slits.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh no, Tenoh-san, I'm sure you're right where you should be.&quot;</p>
<p>The  blonde looked at him frowning, but when she was about to ask for an  explanation she saw him completely nonchalant and she decided otherwise.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually I don't know exactly where am I...&quot; She said massaging her shoulder distractedly.</p>
<p>&quot;That  doesn't matter... yet.&quot; His answer was puzzling, she was trying to  understand it with the result she was becoming frustrated and started  to think he was as annoying as Setsuna-san was. But before she could  make a grunt of annoyance the old man exclaimed.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you hear that?&quot; He was smiling knowingly and was turning around to search something.</p>
<p>&quot;No, I didn't hear anything...&quot; She answered honestly, &quot;What was that?&quot; She was curious.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait...&quot; He gestured her to keep silent then, after a minute, he made a dismissive gesture and turned to her still smiling.</p>
<p>&quot;Warthogs?&quot; She asked standing worried, but the old man shook his head, then with a broader smile answered for her surprise.</p>
<p>&quot;Ghosts.&quot; He whispered.</p>
<p>Haruka's puzzled look would have been something to treasure. How could he know? She looked at him gaping, he just smiled at her.</p>
<p>&quot;These are their voices, can you hear them?&quot; He asked, then seeing her frowning, &quot;...or maybe you can <em>see</em> them.&quot; Haruka couldn't answer, it seemed all too crazy. She knew she  had seen her dead father but she wasn't ready to admit such thing with  a stranger, she wasn't ready to admit she had gone crazy.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone  has their ghosts to chase, no point in letting them go... it's wise for  once be the chaser instead of those who run away.&quot; He said finally  standing up. He threw his sack on his shoulders and turned to face the  tall blonde, a knowing look in his beady eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Where are we going?&quot; She asked with faked enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The short man looked up at her and smiled again, &quot;<em>I'm</em> going to place this traps,&quot; he said pointing at the sack on his shoulders, &quot;<em>you</em> have a different hunt to do, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But-...!&quot; She started to protest but he cut her off with a gesture of his hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Every  hunt or chase it's actually a quest... and it's not necessarily for the  prey.&quot; He said that and walked off without giving her time to reply.  Haruka remained there alone, without knowing where she was nor where to  go.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Isn't supposed to rain a lot on this Pacific Ocean islands?&quot; Yaten complained, sat under a palm tree on the beach.
<p>The  thirst was starting to get to the survivors, almost all of them were  slumped under a tree trying not to tire themselves to limit their need  for water.</p>
<p>&quot;Actually it's supposed to rain just in the rainy  season.&quot; Umino said gaining a nod of approval from Ami. &quot;It should  start any moment, fortunately.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, I hope so...&quot; Said Mina sighing. &quot;... I think I'm starting to dry off.&quot;</p>
<p>Lita  who had just finished to collect some coconuts with Taiki was trying to  open them with a sharpened big stake. She had already noticed before  Jade laying under the tent he had built up with some raincoats, ropes  and debris of the plane. He had a lot of things there and Lita was  starting to suspect he had collected them just for himself and had not  shared. She was getting slightly annoyed and even more suspicious by  the fact he used to spend his days laid down, without helping, but most  important, never complaining. She continued to cast sharp glances to  him as she was taking care of the stubbornly hard fruits.</p>
<p>Some  meters away Hotaru was intent in writing something on a crumpled  exercise book, Ami was taking a look every now and then while reading a  book and sometimes taking attention to the conversation around her.</p>
<p>Serena stopped beside the kid while passing by quite bored.</p>
<p>&quot;What  are you doing, little one?&quot; She asked, leaning down and actually  shadowing the light of the sun. Hotaru lifted her head and stared at  the pigtailed girl with a questioning look. Serena smiled waiting for  an answer and when it didn't come she frowned mumbling something about  the notorious Japanese politeness.</p>
<p>Suddenly she heard a giggle  coming from her right and turned to see Ami with her hand in front of  his mouth trying to stifle a laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;What's so funny?&quot; She asked  quite offended, thinking that was an answer to her inner question about  the reason Japanese were well-known for their courtesy, when it was  clearly untrue.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, sorry Serena-san... it's just that I don't think she speaks any English yet...&quot; She said giggling again.</p>
<p>Hotaru  continued to stare but now she was staring at Ami too with a puzzled  look who matched Serena's. The pigtailed girl sweatdropped and blushed  with an embarrassed laugh.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... sorry... I forgot.&quot; Then Ami  turned to Hotaru and repeated Serena's question in Japanese. The little  girl's face lighten up when she was told what was happening and turning  towards Serena she bowed slightly saying something incomprehensible.</p>
<p>&quot;She said she's doing some homework.&quot; Ami translated for her.</p>
<p>&quot;What!  I can't believe someone does homework on a deserted island, it's pure  masochism!&quot; She exclaimed loudly. Hotaru looked at her puzzled by the  tone she had used and Ami was giggling even more. All of the other  turned to her due to her loud tone.</p>
<p>Darien walked close to her and peeped down on Hotaru's page and saw she was exercising her calligraphy.</p>
<p>&quot;You  should seize the opportunity to learn Japanese a little...&quot; He said,  but when he saw her eyes watering and her shocked face he knew she had  not appreciate his suggestion.</p>
<p>&quot;What! Are you crazy? Studying in a situation like this! I couldn't!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You  wouldn't study even if you were chained to the desk!&quot; Commented Mina  provoking a general burst of laughter and Serena's already well-known  crying.</p>
<p>They were still laughing when a scream silenced all of  them, it was coming from the shore and was a woman's. They jumped up  and run to the shore, Umino ahead of everybody having recognized  Molly's voice and having already a soft spot for the cheerful pregnant  girl.</p>
<p>There remained only Lita who made sure everyone was out of  earshot and out of sight then picked up one of her cooking knives and  headed along the tree line up to where Jade was laying comfortably  reading, seemingly unaware of the scream. With the blade hidden in her  belt behind her back she walked to the tent and stopped standing in the  entrance.</p>
<p>&quot;What do you want?&quot; He said without lifting his eyes from his book.</p>
<p>&quot;The water.&quot; She answered curtly.</p>
<p>&quot;What water?&quot; He asked, this time glancing at her from above the rim of the page.</p>
<p>&quot;You know perfectly well what water!&quot; She exclaimed starting to lose her patience.</p>
<p>&quot;You're raving girl!&quot; He replied and returned to his book.</p>
<p>Lita  was determined to achieve her goal, she had suspected Jade to have a  stored amount of any sort of items he didn't want to share with them,  he had lots of clothes she had never seen in the common lot and he  wasn't complaining about the shortage of water and hadn't tried to  seize it like he had done with the food. She had watched him always  with the blue rucksack on his shoulders even when he had been  collecting medications for the doctor. She didn't trust him, he looked  nothing good, he acted nothing good and he even talked like he was  nothing good.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh really? If I'm raving you wouldn't mind me  opening those pretty suitcases, would you?&quot; She said getting close to  three big suitcases. He jumped up abruptly and grabbed her hand right  before she could lift the lid of the closer one.</p>
<p>&quot;What the Hell do you think you're doing, girl?&quot; He hissed, his eyes narrowed menacingly.</p>
<p>&quot;Just  taking a look, maybe I can find some water in there, you can never  know.&quot; She answered glaring at him firmly and tried to disentangle her  wrist from his painful grip, but he tightened his grasp and twisted her  hand cruelly. She yelped in pain and instinctively grasped the knife  from her belt with her other hand and put it in the face of the man who  immediately let go of her hand and withdrew.</p>
<p>&quot;Bitch!&quot; He hissed,  &quot;Don't provoke me, it wouldn't be wise.&quot; After the first moment of fear  he faced her straight and his look was so confident that it seemed he  was the one brandishing a sharp blade.</p>
<p>&quot;Lita-san what are you  doing?&quot; The voice behind her back made her turn to see Michiru and  Setsuna walking their way questioning looks on their faces.</p>
<p>&quot;She was being annoying.&quot; Jade stated. Lita glared at him, her green eyes like two slits.</p>
<p>&quot;He  could have stolen some water from the plane.&quot; She accused him bluntly.  Michiru and Setsuna exchanged a look then Michiru tried to reason with  the visibly enraged girl who was still holding the long knife.</p>
<p>&quot;Lita-san, the doctor would have told us if some water was missing.&quot; She said eyeing the flashing blade worriedly.</p>
<p>&quot;He had stolen it before we collected it for the common thermal-box.&quot; She continued to accuse him animatedly.</p>
<p>&quot;Well,  that we can't know...&quot; Michiru didn't like the jailbird Jade, and right  for that reason she didn't want him angry and in the nearness of some  weapon, even if it was brandished by someone else.</p>
<p>&quot;Come on  Lita-san, it's not worth it.&quot; Setsuna said calmly, her knowing  expression made Lita follow her advice and she put the knife back under  her belt and glared a last time at him then with a grunt of disapproval  turned following the two older women.</p>
<p>&quot;Next time you want  something from me you better bring something to give me in exchange.  I'm a businessman!&quot; He whispered to Lita's back loud enough to her  alone to hear but if she had heard she didn't let out any sign.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
When  the group reached the shore Molly was standing, her hands up to cover  her mouth and tears running down her cheeks. At her feet laid a blonde  figure, of better said... half-figure.
<p>Umino was the first reaching  the pregnant girl and soon tried to walk her off the macabre view, he  too wanted to be as far as possible from the poor corpse.</p>
<p>One by  one the others arrived running, Serena burst out in tears when she saw  the scene and buried herself in Darien's chest, Mina and Rei just  looked away stifling a gasp, Yaten stared at the figure unable to move  or just look away. After a minute of general confusion Dr. Mizuno had  the spirit of taking control of the situation.</p>
<p>&quot;Ami-chan, please  help me.&quot; She said to her daughter who looked quite anguished but  didn't give any sign of a breakdown, &quot;We have to move... <em>her</em> away. We need a couple of strong person.&quot; She looked around and called  Taiki, Darien and Umino, instructing about collecting the corpse and  taking it to her tent.</p>
<p>Just then Furuhata arrived panting, he  stopped just near the corpse and gasped, the expression of utter horror  turned in a puzzled one, he looked from the corpse to the others and  until his eyes stopped on Serena still sobbing loudly then again on the  blond head laying on the sand. He searched Rei's eyes and saw  realization in there, in fact the girl who had met such a horrible  death was blonde and had two pigtails, though a lot shorter than  Serena's. Furuhata admitted a minute later with Rei he had thought  Haruka to see things that morning, after all she sure didn't look well.  Rei couldn't admit it herself, but inside she knew she had thought the  same.</p>
<p>The doctor, for the majority's shock had wanted to examine  the corpse, or what it remained of it. With Ami's help she checked on  her injuries and tried to establish the cause of death, the others had  soon dismissed the subject saying it had obviously been a shark and  sure that was the more reasonable explanation, but the doctor wasn't  used to make suppositions and just be satisfied with them, usually she  would have search for proofs and that was what she wanted to do this  time too.</p>
<p>With the scanty set of instruments she managed to  establish the poor girl wasn't already dead when her body had been  slaughtered that way but her lung had no water in them, so she hadn't  drowned, reasonable explanation was that she had died from the injuries  to her lower extremities.</p>
<p>Ami was helping her mother efficiently,  even if both weren't coroners they knew enough to perform a good enough  autopsy. The younger woman was examining the injuries on the stumps of  the girl's legs when something got her attention.</p>
<p>&quot;Look at these  wounds, Mom.&quot; She pointed to some circular wounds, the diameter of a  pencil and quite deep. Her mother examined them and turned to Ami with  a questioning expression. The short haired girl got the hint and  explained, &quot;They're round and deep and the distance between what I  suppose are rows of teeth is barely 20 centimeters.&quot; She illustrated,  &quot;But... sharks have teeth with razor shape and should give wounds more  like those given by a knife, not a icebreaker or a screwdriver.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You're  telling me it wasn't a shark, aren't you?&quot; Dr. Mizuno asked. Ami nodded  solemnly. &quot;So what do you think made it?&quot; She asked trusting deeply in  her daughter's competence.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it was something who bit with  great strength, so I think it was a big animal, but more like a feline  or a... bear than a shark. And it can be plausible cause you ascertain  she didn't die for the water. We can reasonably think that she could  have died on solid ground, or anyway we can't rule it out.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ami-chan,  you're telling me some animal did that to the poor girl on this  island?&quot; The blue-haired woman exclaimed suddenly scared.</p>
<p>&quot;Think  about it, mom, think about what they told us about the cockpit...&quot;  Unfortunately Kimiko Mizuno couldn't deny the logic in her extremely  intelligent daughter's speech and admitting that a shiver run down her  spine.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Ami exclaimed suddenly lighten up with  what her mother imagined being intuition. She quickly was looking  intently at the dead girl's hands, more precisely her nails. &quot;Of  course! Look, there's sand under her nails, it's deep up to her flesh!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Like  she'd been digging her fingers strongly in the sand... like she was  trying to drag herself without the support of her legs...&quot; she lighten  up with realization too and so did the horror. &quot;Like something was  pulling her back by her legs... Kami-sama Ami, it's horrible.&quot; She  concluded murmuring. Ami touched her mother's arm to give some sort of  comfort.</p>
<p>When they had finished their post-mortem examination  they exited the tent for a bit of fresh air, right outside there were  two very anguished and worried Rei and Furuhata waiting for them.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-san,  Furuhata-san, what are you doing here? Is something wrong?&quot; Ami's  mother saw the expression on their faces and got immediately into  doctor/mom mode.</p>
<p>Furuhata fidgeted a little and when was clear he  wasn't about to talk any minute Rei spoke in a serious and apparently  cold tone.</p>
<p>&quot;Doctor Mizuno-san, we would like to know if the girl  died drowning.&quot; The doctor's questioning look prompted her to explain  herself, &quot;See... this morning we think we saw her in the water.&quot; She  didn't explained the fact Furuhata and her had prevented Haruka from  saving the poor girl thinking she was going crazy or just a little too  stressed.</p>
<p>The doctor's face fell at the thought of the presumable  death of the girl and her expression was immediately matched by Rei's  who thought about the worst. When the older woman realized that she  hurried in reassuring the miko about it.</p>
<p>&quot;Rei-san, Furuhata-san,  you couldn't do anything, she was already dead when she ended up into  the water.&quot; Rei and Furuhata exchanged a look, though relieved, their  expression never turned in a relieved one, they were both thinking  about Haruka's anguish that morning and that would have been fair  searching her and telling her... even if no one had seen her for hours.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Her  head started to throb again, and again all seemed to turn dim, she had  walked in circles for about two hours and was starting to lose any hope  of founding her way back to the camp. Then, out of the corner of her  eye she had a glimpse of a familiar dark figure. This time when she  turned her father was there no more eluding her. Now she was uncertain  as to follow him or concentrate on the path to the camp. But when he  turned to face her he had such a challenging look in his dark - almost  black - eyes that all the rage her body was still capable of surfaced  and she dashed off in a breakneck run growling.
<p>She run and run,  several times she lost tracks of him and stopped looking around  feverishly with such momentum that her head spinned furiously. Often  she had to got again on her feet after having tripped over some stone  or emerging root. Soon she forgot about the camp, about Hotaru,  Michiru, even about herself the only things she could see, feel even  remember were her own anger and the dark suited figure ahead of her.</p>
<p>After  what had felt like an entire lifetime to her she realized she was  nearer and nearer until she could almost graze his shoulder with her  outstretched hand.</p>
<p>&quot;Stop!&quot; She yelled, &quot;Stop, you coward!&quot;</p>
<p>Then it was just instinct to guide her... she leapt on him, fell headlong on the ground and lost her consciousness.</p>

<em>TICK! </em>
<p><em>TICK! </em></p>
<p><em>TICK!</em></p>
<p><em>The fourth pebble wasn't necessary, the first floor window lit and after a few seconds the dormer slid up.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey...&quot;  Haruka whispered from down in the backyard. She had snuck out of her  house in the middle of the night, had 'borrowed' her father's Jaguar  and had driven up there, then she had left the car far enough so it  wouldn't have been seen or heard and finally was there in the dark  Ryans house's backyard.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka!&quot; The surprised voice was still a little sleepy. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Isabel whispered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  had to talk to you.&quot; Was Haruka's simple answer. She was fidgeting in  the cold night breeze, it was starting to rain, some drops already  staining her coat.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka, if my father sees you, he's gonna kill you!&quot; Her whisper was becoming anxious.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Then  toss me the rope before he sees me!&quot; The blonde whispered back. Up in  her room Isabel was uncertain whether let her up or not. She already  was in lots of troubles, her father was really pissed and she hadn't  been allowed to leave her room except for school and it would have been  so for an entire month, but she hadn't seen Haruka for four days now,  not even in school... and no matter how much she tried to deny that  even with herself, she missed her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Come on Isabel, I'm  freezing!&quot; It was now raining, almost pouring and the blonde wasn't  moving. Isabel disappeared in her room for a moment then a thick rope  was tossed and remained dangling one meter up the ground. Haruka  grabbed it and with skill due to habit she climbed up the back of the  house to the balcony out of Isabel's room window.</em></p>
<p><em>The  brown-haired girl leant to the windowsill and when Haruka was in front  of her she didn't move aside letting her in. She stood there looking  her blonde friend intently, the blond wet hair plastered on her  forehead, the confused look in her teal, charming eyes, the dark shadow  under them, the tired feature on her handsome face.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Look  at you...&quot; She murmured and with a trembling hand she caressed Haruka's  cheek. The blonde was puzzled by her lover's behavior, she stood there  for a minute, her cheek still cupped by the warm hand. Then a shiver  shook her and the spell broke.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey, how about letting me  in? It's not like I'm not enjoying the rain but...&quot; She said smiling,  but the other's face didn't matched hers.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm sorry... I  can't...&quot; Isabel's hand wouldn't stop caressing her cheek, even with  her thumb, but her eyes couldn't look at hers.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;What...?  Isabel, come on, it's cold. I wanted to talk to you, you managed to  elude me in school these days...&quot; Haruka was starting to realize  something was wrong, something more, cause she was already in troubles  up to her ears.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I can't let you in, Haruka... not  anymore.&quot; The resolve Isabel had thought she could have had had  disappeared the moment she had seen Haruka's soaked up with that  pleading expression in her eyes.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I know, my father  'filled me in'. With a couple of good blows just to underline the  matter.&quot; She said but smiled not to get the other worried.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Oh... I'm sorry. Are you ok?&quot; Isabel asked suddenly forgetting everything else.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm  fine, no need to worry... but... he's also having me transferred to a  boarding school.&quot; What Haruka saw passing through Isabel's brown eyes  wasn't what she had expected. It wasn't sadness or concern, it had  seemed rather... relief? No... it couldn't have been. &quot;But... I'm going  to chose one in the nearness and I'll manage to sneak out to see you,  trust me.&quot; She said with the usual confidence and a wink that reminded  Isabel why she had been helpless to the other girl's charm since she  had winked and smiled at her the first time they had met over a year  before. So she remained silent for a moment, her heart clenched. </em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He's kicking you out, isn't he?&quot; She asked.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;No... he just-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Haruka.&quot; Isabel scolded softly.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;He's really pissed.&quot; Haruka admitted.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I'm  sorry, Haruka. I'm sorry for that... and... a-and I'm sorry cause I  won't see you again... No!&quot; She stopped the blonde's protest before it  could reach her lips. &quot;Haruka, I won't see you again, I won't call you  and you... you won't call me.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;No! Isabel you can't-...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Of course I can Haruka, and I will. Please, don't make it harder...&quot; She pleaded, tears running down her cheeks.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;No!  It's your father's will, not yours. You don't want this, I... I... love  you!&quot; This time Haruka forgot to whisper and her words pierced Isabel  like a shrill, even if they had been spoken in a hoarse tone.</em></p>
<p><em>Isabel  lifted both her hands and cupped Haruka's cheeks, wet by the rain, then  she leaned forward and kissed her. Haruka's lips were cold like her  whole body while Isabel's were warm and salty cause of her tears. When  she withdrew she saw Haruka's eyes watering too and that made her  almost loose it, but soon she recomposed herself and looking the blonde  right in the eyes she spoke.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I love you Haruka, but this  is what I want. Maybe you can bear leaving your family... after all  your father isn't much of a family anyway, but I can't. He made me  chose... and I have chosen them. I'm sorry.&quot; She watched as mixed  emotions passed through teal eyes without any sound made, not even a  small protest from pale lips. &quot;I love you but I have to let you go  nonetheless. I... I don't think I'll be able to forget you...&quot; The last  words seemed to move Haruka who turned icy cold-eyed.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>&quot;You will, don't worry.&quot; She said bitterly, then she turned and climbed down the wall and walked away in the rain.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>TICK!</p>
<p>TICK!</p>
<p>TICK!</p>
<p>Haruka  blinked a couple of times. She didn't know where she was, nor how she  had ended up with her back on the ground. She knew it was raining.</p>
<p>'No  wait! If it's raining... why it's doing it only on my forehead?' She  got up and her head protested painfully. She searched her body but it  was dry except for her forehead, but she could hear the noise... it was  water downpouring. She looked around and finally she saw it, a small  waterfall and a little pool. The car-racer soon passed a hand on her  forehead and brought it to her mouth. It wasn't salty.</p>
<p>'Fresh water!' She stood up beaming. &quot;Fresh water!&quot; She exclaimed then out loud even if no one was there to hear her.</p>
<p>Then  the blonde took her time to look around. She was in a small glade that  ended against a rocky formation, the water spurted out of it and fell  from a short height, gathering in a pool in the hollow stone. In front  of the spring opened on a wide cave. Haruka walked into the cave, there  was enough light to see several meters deep inside cause the entrance  was tall and wide. An idea crept inside her head and she thought it  could be a very comfortable place to settle, with water and shelter  from sun and wind.</p>
<p>She was thrilled, the shortage of water had  been something very alarming and a real threat for their lives. After  these considerations she realized she was thirsty so she dived her  hands in the cool water and began drinking avidly.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;Michiru-chan?  Michiru-chan!...&quot; Seiya called her for the second time but she didn't  answer. He then sat down beside her on the big trunk and touched gently  her shoulder. The aqua-haired woman started suddenly out of her pensive  state.
<p>&quot;Hey, are you alright?&quot; He asked a little concerned.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;  She replied confused, then she realized she had spaced out seeing the  expression on his face and smiled reassuringly. &quot;Oh, gomen Seiya-kun,  I'm fine... I'm fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm...&quot; He was unconvinced.</p>
<p>They  had had their lunch just as the 'hunters' had made their way back to  the camp. He and Michiru had eaten their meal together after Seiya's  insistence but right after lunch the young violinist had wanted to  spend some time with little Hotaru. He had decided to join her, after  all he had no one to be with since with his brothers things were too  awkward, beside, he thought, spending as much as possible time with her  could help bringing them closer. He wanted to be again Michiru's main  company, he had already allowed too much time to Tenoh Haruka to spend  with <em>his</em> Michiru-chan.</p>
<p>So he had joined Michiru and had  spent a full hour with the little girl. Though his initial perplexity  Hotaru proved to be a brilliant and lovable kid and not the spoiled  brat he had thought. She had greeted and accepted him soon in her plays  and it had been quite enjoyable watching her interacting with Michiru.  It was sort of funny to see the always composed and detached –  sometimes even <em>cold</em> – violinist looking so informal and unconstrained. It had happened only a few times before when was in a playful mood.</p>
<p>The  only flaw had been that the little girl kept referring to the  aqua-haired woman as 'Michiru-mama'. He had found it awfully annoying  especially when she had started to ask about 'Haruka-papa''s  whereabouts. Using a moment of solitude Michiru had explained to him,  with a slight pink shade on her cheeks, about their nicknames and it  would have been reasonable not to give too much meaning to it, after  all it had been the compensating fantasy of a traumatized child... but  he wasn't able to not feel annoyed.</p>
<p>He had tried to tell himself  it wasn't jealousy, that it would have been foolish even thinking there  could be any kind of challenge between Haruka and him about Michiru...  but no matter how much he tried to rationalize he continued to feel  something boiling deep inside him whenever the blonde car-racer was  mentioned or involved personally.</p>
<p>Dismissing those thoughts he  realized Michiru had spaced out again, he fought the urge to get her  attention, instead he watched her intently. Though she was clearly  tense she was as beautiful as ever, her face and her body were those of  a goddess.</p>
<p>'Such perfection!' He thought then and he remembered  doing the same thing the first time he had seen her. She was the woman  he had always pictured beside him in all his dreams. A real lady,  beautiful and talented, the perfect match for him. He had daydreamed  several times about the two of them admired and even envied... as 'the  perfect couple'. He liked her company, she was always controlled and  had things under control all the time, 'She balances me for those times  I go too far...'</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan... where are you?&quot; He asked trying to tear her out of her thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh?&quot; She asked confused by the question. Seiya laughed softly. He encircled her shoulders with his arm.</p>
<p>&quot;Where were you? You seemed miles away...&quot; Michiru's blue eyes lingered for a moment on the wood.</p>
<p>&quot;Gomen Seiya-kun, I'm being quite rude.&quot; She said with a smile that never reached her eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;What's bothering you?&quot; He asked concerned.</p>
<p>Michiru  looked in his eyes for a long minute. He seemed honestly concerned and  she wanted to confide him her worries, but she knew there was a subject  he didn't like and was the one troubling her at the moment. She had  realized Haruka and Seiya felt some sort of rivalry with each other and  she couldn't consider herself completely out of it. She didn't know why  Seiya was so worried about her spending time wit the blonde, she had  found herself thinking more than once he was jealous but... why? She  knew Seiya liked her in more than a friendly or professional way, but  she barely knew Haruka and... and... she was... <em>a woman</em>. But she was also aware of the strange fascination Haruka exerted on her.</p>
<p>&quot;It's...&quot;  She hesitated for a moment then she saw his clear eyes and decided to  be honest, &quot;It's Haruka-san, she's been in the wood all day and I think  she's not too well. The fact is I'm pretty worried.&quot; She looked at him  intently almost checking his reaction so the dark-haired singer tried  to keep himself from blaming the blonde racer for making Michiru worry  - and for being so damn attention-attracting – instead he tried to  dismiss the thing as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&quot;She is exploring the  neighborhoods for Furuhata-kun, isn't she?&quot; He tried to calm her.  Michiru chuckled bitterly and he was quite surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;Ara, no...  that was just an excuse Furuhata made up this morning...&quot; As she was  speaking Michiru realized she had made a terrible mistake.</p>
<p>&quot;I knew it!&quot; Seiya exclaimed almost triumphantly.</p>
<p>&quot;Seiya-kun!&quot;  She scolded and he soon apologized but the smug smile didn't leave his  lips. &quot;I'm serious, it's not safe out there, you know it!&quot; Michiru  seemed very upset and Seiya didn't want to blow his position just when  he felt he was closer and closer to her.</p>
<p>&quot;I know... I didn't see her, but maybe Yuiichiro-san or Grandpa-san did-...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Rei's  grandfather told me he had met her and had had his lunch with her...  and he told me not to worry that she'll be back soon...&quot; She  anticipated him.</p>
<p>Seiya then smiled at her reassuringly, &quot;Good  then! The old man is trustworthy, he knows what's what... beside he's  some kind of Rambo... I know it seems crazy but I can tell you!&quot; He  exclaimed winking, then squeezed her shoulders affectionately. She  wasn't reassured enough to relax but decided to concentrate on him for  a while cause worrying about Haruka was quite tiring and distressing.  She smiled at him to assure him she was calmer.</p>
<p>The dark-haired  man smiled back then drew back his arm and straightened himself. He  shifted anxiously on his seat and then took a deep breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Michiru-chan, I have to talk to you...&quot; He said softly but firmly.</p>
<p>Michiru  looked at him questioningly, he seemed turned serious, and seemed also  a bit nervous. &quot;I'm listening...&quot; She said smiling at him.</p>
<p>&quot;How long have we known each other, Michiru-chan?&quot; He asked gravely.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh... almost three years, for what I can remember...&quot; She answered puzzled by his quite rhetorical question.</p>
<p>&quot;In  fact you remember right... And during this years I've been able to know  you, to know what a talented, intelligent and graceful person you  are...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, Seiya-kun you're-...&quot; She said even more puzzled, but he cut her off.</p>
<p>&quot;Please  Michiru-chan, don't interrupt me or I'll never be able to continue.&quot; He  pleaded her a little embarrassed. When she nodded he continued, &quot;...  ehm... I was saying... I could also see what a good heart you have,  you're generous, kind and understanding and you can enchant people just  with your music.&quot; He took her hand in his and squeezed it lightly, &quot;I  wanted to tell you that you are... just <em>perfect</em> and that you're the most important person in the world for me.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  was dumfounded for this confession, she had always known he had an  infatuation for her but she had never thought he could confess his  feeling so... <em>easily</em> and in such a situation. On the other hand  the last days events had been quite traumatic, not just the crash and  all those deaths but the fight with his brothers, too, so it was  something to be expected.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know what to say, Seiya-kun...&quot; She answered honestly.</p>
<p>&quot;You  don't have to say anything, I wanted to say it to you cause it's what  I've been feeling for quite a while already.&quot; He held her hand tightly  for a moment then let it go with a clear smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Your words were  beautiful...&quot; She leaned forward, Seiya's heart skipped a bit seeing  her face getting closer and closer to his, then a bit of disappointment  when she shifted and planted a soft kiss on his cheek. &quot;...Thank you.&quot;  She whispered in his ear sending a shiver down his spine and not just  there.</p>
<p>Michiru then stood and left him without any other word.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Something  inside her was burning, no matter how much refreshing water she drank.  She stopped her frenzied drinking and looked into the water. When the  creased surface became still again she could see her reflex trembling  slightly cause of the near waterfall.
<p>She observed her own image  intently and dispassionately, her face was so tense that her skin  seemed stretched over her cheekbones, her lips were reduced to a thin  line and her jaw was stifling clenched. The sun of the previous days  had tanned her skin but underneath it was visible an unhealthy pallor,  the same sun had also shown off the handful of freckles spread on her  nose and her usually sand-blond hair were way paler, but what got her  attention were her own eyes.</p>
<p>She was conscious of her being  handsome, she knew that was a big part of her charm, but she also knew  her eyes had always been her best 'weapon', she was told more than once  her look was magnetic and she was self-confident enough to believe  that. But now she looked into the water and she saw her eyes like a  weakness, not her strong point. They were bloodshot and had dark  circles around them, they weren't a shield anymore, instead they had  become a window open on her tormented soul. Every feeling, every  fear... every single emotion pulsing inside her she could see it in her  eyes too and that was... petrifying.</p>
<p>Knowing her eyes bared her  soul, that anyone could read her inside was equal to confess it to the  world: it was embarrassing... it was weak... and it was <em>dangerous</em>.</p>
<p>'Though there had been a time when you weren't scared of feeling...' Her inner voice said.</p>
<p>'I'm not scared of feeling!' She replied vehemently, her grip on the stony edge of the pool tightening.</p>
<p>'Oh, of course... you're right. You're not scared of feeling, you're just scared of <em>people knowing</em> you do.' Her conscience was right, she had tried but had found it  impossible just stopping to feel, instead there had been something she  could have done, she could have prevented people knowing it. She could  act like she didn't care and she could keep herself distant so she  wouldn't have to expose herself. Her soul and her heart were sore and  battered, they had lost several battles... and she wanted to keep them  as far away as possible from anything could hurt.</p>
<p>Haruka had  loved her mother profoundly and she had died prematurely abandoning her  daughter; Haruka had also relied on her grandmother but she too had  died before her niece could say good-bye; then she had loved and  trusted Isabel too and had been betrayed; finally she had loved her  father, deeply, but he had rejected her and then she had ended hating  him deeply just as much, like matching his hate with her own was a way  to still be bound to him.</p>
<p>She looked intently in her own teal  eyes, they were so strange not green nor blue, always shifting and  intriguing. She liked them, they were her grandmother's and her  mother's too. Haruka had always been proud whenever someone told her  she had her mother's eyes, it made her feel closer to her, especially  since her mother had died. Looking into the water, now, she saw a smirk  growing on her face. The more she observed her own image the more she  smirked, looking at her unmistakably western features she realized –  not for the first time but with particular satisfaction – she didn't  resemble her father if not faintly. It seemed her body had refused his  features just like he had refused her as a daughter.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you  were waiting for me...&quot; She murmured still looking into the water.  &quot;D'you hear me! I hope you were wishing with all your dead heart of  seeing me there!&quot; She stood. &quot;Yeah... I hope you've pictured me there  crying cause - know what? - I never shed a tear for you, YOU FUCKING  BASTARD!&quot; She yelled to the empty air. &quot;I hope you hurt...&quot; This time  it was just a whisper.</p>
<p>The blonde remained silent for a minute  looking down to her feet. She didn't acknowledged the first drops of  rain, big gray clouds had shadowed the sky quickly but she never  noticed that. She stretched out her arms in an inviting gesture.</p>
<p>&quot;Come  on, where are you now?&quot; She turned around slowly, a feverishly look in  her eyes, &quot;What's happened? You decided I wasn't even worth to be  tormented by your damned ghost anymore, did you?&quot; Her sarcasm was  followed by a bitter laugh. &quot;Come on!&quot;</p>
<p>But nothing happened, no  ghosts, no voices, just the rapid ticking of the heavy drops on the  foliage, but the main noise she could hear was the roaring of her own  blood rushing in her veins and the furious beating of her heart.</p>
<p>&quot;You  know... I'm glad I'm here.&quot; She paused turning around again, &quot;Yes, I'm  glad that bloody plane crashed down! CAUSE IT PREVENTED ME TO COME TO  YOUR FUCKING FUNERAL!&quot; She yelled so loud that ended up breathless  falling on her knees exhausted, all the exertion of the day suddenly  weighting on her. She panted, her head throbbing painfully for several  minutes trying to regain her breath. When she lifted her head and  looked up, realizing just then it was raining, she saw it.</p>
<p>There,  stuck up amid the high branches, was another section of the plane, it  seemed just part of the roof. She walked closer and noticed lots of  things had fallen on the ground and were spread before her feet while  others were hanging from the lower branches.</p>
<p>She didn't examined  the assortment of things cause something had already got her attention.  It was a black case, she collected it from inside of another silver  security-case the lid of which had been broken in the impact. She  opened it to check the contents, then took off her shirt, it was not  too wet cause the lush foliage prevented the rain to pour down  completely, and wrapped the case in it to protect it from the rain.  Then she tried to remember the sun's position the last time she had  seen it and decided to head southward – or towards what she presumed  was South – cause the camp was on the southern coast and she hoped to  reach it or at least reach the shore then, walking along it, to arrive  to the camp.</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes of walking she noticed  something red tied up on a tree around the lower part of the trunk. It  was a strip of fabric hopefully placed by Rei's grandfather to mark the  traps. She looked around and then she saw it, a rope hid under fallen  leaves, she walked around it carefully and searched for other red  strips, she found another one and followed on that path.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
As  quickly as the storm had come it went away and an about-to-setting sun  returned to shine on the busy camp. The mood wasn't a good one, the  downpour had made all the survivors hope they could save some water,  but by the time they had found a couple of containers to use as vats  the storm had ceased and the poor volunteers were soaked up with enough  water just to fill a small bottle. As the rain ended they returned to  their activities gloomy and depressed.
<p>Furuhata was feverishly  fumbling around his radio devices, looking up to the sky every now and  then; Taiki and Yaten were checking on the wood under the tarpaulins  they had made out of raincoats; Seiya was helping Grandpa, Yuiichiro  and Darien making new hunts and fishing tools; Lita, Mina and Ami were  counting fruits for their dinner while Rei and Serena seemed engrossed  arguing about some trivial issue; Molly was resting a little enjoying  the break from the hot sun after the rain and Umino was... watching  over her; Jade was of course in his shelter reading a book; Setsuna was  again reading Dr. Tomoe's notes sat near a lost-in-thought Michiru who  was supposed to watch over Hotaru doing some kind of homework – the  activity that seemed better keep the clever child's mind occupied.</p>
<p>&quot;Is  that right, Michiru-mama?&quot; The little girl asked stretching her hand  with the creased notebook in it showing her child-like handwriting.  &quot;Michiru-mama?&quot; She called again to the apparently unaware aqua-haired  woman. When the black-haired kid received no answer again she thought  better than disturb the violinist and went to Setsuna who had raised  her head hearing the repeated calling of Hotaru and noticing Michiru's  impassiveness.</p>
<p>The older woman smiled at Michiru and then at the  little girl and checked her work, when she made Hotaru noticing her  mistakes she was about to return to her work when she realized the  little girl was still looking at her with the expression of someone who  wants to speak out loud but is still uncertain.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it,  Hotaru-chan?&quot; She asked kindly. Hotaru looked to Michiru who was  looking into space seemingly miles away. &quot;Your Michiru-mama isn't  giving you much attention, is she?&quot;</p>
<p>Hotaru shook her head firmly,  &quot;Setsuna-mama, it isn't that, it's just that... do you... do you think  she's worried about Haruka-papa?&quot; The little girl asked, the last words  spoken in one breath.</p>
<p>Setsuna smiled to the bright kid, she patted the sand beside her and gestured the child to sit down.</p>
<p>&quot;Well...  it could be so, little girl. Why are you asking, are you worried about  Haruka-papa too?&quot; She inquired. Hotaru seemed to think about her words  before talking.</p>
<p>&quot;A little...&quot; She answered honestly. Setsuna  hugged her with a comforting arm and noticed the child was still  looking to Michiru.</p>
<p>&quot;What is it?&quot; She asked again knowingly. Hotaru seemed unworried about Setsuna's insightfulness, she shrugged and answered.</p>
<p>&quot;I think she's thinking about Seiya-san.&quot; The child's statement</p>
<p>surprised Setsuna. The insight and intelligence of that child was challenging even for the mysterious woman.</p>
<p>&quot;And why is that, Hotaru-chan?&quot; She was curious now.</p>
<p>&quot;Cause  she looks sad.&quot; The child said confidently, Setsuna was again surprised  by that explanation. Michiru indeed looked sad and thoughtful and sure  she had spent lot of time with Seiya since he had returned to the camp.  The two of them had seemed to talk seriously not long ago and since  then the young woman had been thoughtful.</p>
<p>&quot;And you think that  thinking about Seiya-san is making Michiru-mama sad...&quot; The garnet-eyed  woman commented. Hotaru nodded, &quot;And do you think that thinking about  Haruka-papa wouldn't make her sad or worried?&quot; Setsuna pushed.</p>
<p>Hotaru seemed pondering her words carefully then she turned and looked the older woman firmly in the eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Worried, yes, but not sad.&quot; Setsuna couldn't stifle a chuckle to the child's incredible insightfulness.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think you're a very bright girl, Hotaru-chan.&quot; She said patting the  little black-haired head. Hotaru beamed proudly for the compliment.</p>
<p>&quot;And...&quot; Setsuna looked down to the little girl.</p>
<p>&quot;What?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;And...  Michiru-mama is nicer when she's with Haruka-papa!&quot; The little girl  concluded suddenly being child-like again. Setsuna laughed softly at  the last statement and couldn't help but agree with her.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
'Oh  Seiya, why did you have to stress such issue right now? You'd be just  perfect... but...' Michiru shook her head sadly, she had known for a  long time Seiya's feelings for her, in fact she could not say she was  surprised, but...
<p>'...but you're not in love with him...' Her inner voice stated.</p>
<p>'...but  it isn't the right time.' She stressed her version. 'We're lost and in  life-threatening danger...' It seemed like she was trying to convince  herself.</p>
<p>'It isn't the right time or maybe it isn't the right... <em>person</em>?' A shiver run down her spine.</p>
<p>'Oh,  nonsense!' Her inner dialogue was turning annoying, so she stood hoping  that a walk could distract her a little. Without a word she walked off  towards the shore in the chill of the evening breeze.</p>
<p>She didn't  went far when she noticed someone was approaching her from behind. She  could tell they were very close cause they were shielding the wind from  her. She stopped and turned around ending face to face with a  battered-looking - but smiling - Haruka.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey...&quot; The tall blonde greeted her.</p>
<p>The  aqua-haired girl was short of words. The image in front of her was  almost shocking. Haruka was soaking wet, in her undershirt and black  slacks, her hair was plastered to her head, her eyes feverish and she  was paler than usual. Her clothes were tore and dirty like she had  crawled on the ground and she was trembling in the cold wind.</p>
<p>&quot;Ara  Haruka, look at you...&quot; Finally she whispered caressing the blonde's  cheek. Haruka frowned and Michiru thought she had seen fear flashing  for a moment in the blonde's eyes. &quot;Come on, you have to change your  clothes.&quot; She took the taller woman's arm and pulled her towards her  place.</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; Michiru looked at the car-racer questioningly. &quot;I...  I have something to give you first.&quot; And it was then that she noticed  the dirty bundle Haruka had under her arm. The blonde handed it to her  smiling. &quot;Come on... it's for you.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru frowned, the blonde  didn't seem herself, the anticipation clear in her eyes as she lent her  the wrapped stuff with trembling hands. The violinist took it uncertain  and carefully unfolded it realizing the dirty cloth was Haruka's - once  white – shirt. It seemed even dirtier than her undershirt. But every  other thought disappeared from her mind once she realized what was in  her hands.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh my God, Haruka...&quot; Michiru was incredulous. She  kept looking back and forth from the black case in her hand to the  smiling face of the blonde.</p>
<p>&quot;Open it.&quot; Haruka urged gently.  Michiru didn't made herself be asked twice, she made click the little  lock open and slowly lifted the lid. Inside, encased in blue velvet was  an ancient-looking and neatly polished violin with its bow.</p>
<p>The  aqua-haired woman's smile made Haruka's exertion and throbbing headache  fade away in a glorious moment. Such happiness in those ocean-blue eyes  was something she would have cherished all her life, she was sure of  it. She wasn't even able to reprimand herself for letting another  person affect her so much like she always did. Right then Haruka just  knew she felt like she could die then and be happy, she felt like she  had lived her entire life just to see those eyes in that right moment.</p>
<p>Before  she could figure out what was happening Haruka felt a refreshing  warmness against her freezing body and two equally warm arms encircling  her gently. When she realized Michiru was embracing her she stifled and  her heart started beating so hard and fast she feared the aqua-haired  woman could hear it.</p>
<p>Michiru indeed heard Haruka's heart beating  at a breakneck pace cause she had her head resting on the blonde's  chest. She had just acted instinctively hugging the taller woman and  she would have let go of her immediately if she hadn't felt the  trembling subsiding and the emotion showing off in that heart-beating,  suddenly Michiru felt like there wasn't a better thing to do at that  moment, a better place to be.</p>
<p>After a long minute the young  violinist finally let go a little and lifting herself on her tiptoes  she kissed the dumbfounded blonde's cheek and – for the second time in  a couple of hours - she found herself whispering a 'thank you' in  someone's ear... even if her heart felt completely different.</p>
<p>In  the distance several couple of eyes was locked to the hugging couple.  Deep purple eyes were beaming happily and beside them garnet ones  smiled knowingly; others were curious, surprised or just amused but in  another corner two dark eyes were burning with jealousy.</p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
&quot;So...  no more planes overflying?&quot; The question had no trace of sarcasm and  Furuhata knew who had been asking. He didn't turn around but he  answered nonetheless.
<p>&quot;Nope...&quot;</p>
<p>The camp was silent and the sea  was so calm it seemed almost unmoving, Furuhata was contemplating the  stars shining in the dark sky of the night, the moon was setting low on  the horizon. Haruka laid beside him on the cool sand and they remained  in silence for a while.</p>
<p>&quot;You were right.&quot; The blond man exclaimed suddenly.</p>
<p>&quot;Uh?&quot; Haruka was confused.</p>
<p>&quot;This morning you were right, there was indeed someone in the sea...&quot; He explained.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that... I know, Doctor Mizuno-san filled me in.&quot; Haruka replied somberly.</p>
<p>&quot;I see...&quot; Furuhata seemed at loss of words so more minutes passed in silence. Then he spoke again.</p>
<p>&quot;Haruka-san,  I finished assembling the aerial and the boosters... we can place it  tomorrow.&quot; He exclaimed without the usual enthusiasm. Haruka raised an  eyebrow surprised.</p>
<p>&quot;What's the point in doing it? I thought we  should be rescue anytime soon, shouldn't we?&quot; She turned to him, she  realized too late her sarcasm was gratuitous.</p>
<p>Furuhata looked at  her sadly but he didn't tell anything until, &quot;Haruka-san... what's the  point in running away on an island? ...In the end you will always  return at the starting point.&quot; Haruka was surprised, he had always been  docile and she wasn't expecting such a retort, a wise and insightful  retort indeed.</p>
<p>&quot;Touché...&quot; She admitted calmly, she was too exhausted and in a too good mood to protest.</p>
<p>&quot;Have you ever felt completely abandoned? Like you were alone in the world?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot; The blonde didn't answered, she was petrified by his question.</p>
<p>&quot;I  think...&quot; Furuhata continued like he had never expected an answer,  &quot;...that no one should ever feel completely alone. I think it's the  worst feeling ever, loneliness... and helplessness.&quot; He stated. Haruka  didn't answer again. She started to feel the weight of that  conversation... and of that entire day. &quot;That's why I'll never stop  hoping and I'll never stop trying... cause I don't want to feel like I  have nothing to lose. Everyone deserves some faith.&quot; He concluded,  looking up to the dark sky.</p>
<p>Haruka was already lost in thoughts,  she remembered her grandmother's words the last time she saw her. Her  heart clenched in her chest, she missed her and she missed her mother.  She missed her mother so much that she had had to force herself to  banish every thought about her to not hurt too much. And then she has  become so accustomed to that that she had just stopped thinking about  her mother like she never had one. And she realized then she had did  that with her grandmother too, even with Isabel. The one person she had  never stopped thinking about was also the only one she had managed to  hate: her father.</p>
<p>Her discomfort was growing, she didn't want to  stay and let the oblivious Furuhata remind her of her lonely life. A  life many would have wished to live but that – in that right moment –  just some fans who didn't even know her and some sponsors worried about  waste of money were missing.</p>
<p>So, she did what she was renowned  all over the world for doing best: she run away. Not literally maybe,  but she run away nonetheless standing and wishing Furuhata good-night,  then walking slowly to the place where Setsuna and Hotaru were  sleeping. She sat down beside the little girl and caressed the tiny  black-haired head.</p>
<p>After several minutes Haruka was still there  listening to the steady breathing of that innocent, fragile creature,  she didn't know why she was so fond of her, but she knew she was ready  to lay down her life for her. This wasn't like her, she always tried to  not get attached to anyone, but that very time she realized she was  failing miserably... twice.</p>
<p>'Oh no Haruka... let's pass for the little girl, but with <em>her</em>... you're gonna get hurt bad, <em>really bad</em>. You can't let that woma affecting you this way!' She thought to herself.</p>
<p>'It's too late...' Her annoying inner voice stated gloating. 'Think about how happy she was when-...'</p>
<p>&quot;That's  enough!&quot; She hissed aloud. When she realized that she checked if Hotaru  had woken up. Fortunately she hadn't, so Haruka guiltily stopped  caressing her and laid down not knowing someone else had woken and was  now looking at her with worried garnet eyes as she was about to spend  her umpteenth sleepless night.</p>

<em>The  sad notes filled the air of the the luxury hotel's empty bar. It was  late at night, and just a well dealt charming smile to a young and  pretty member of the personnel had permitted her to be there. She had  attended the party to celebrate her championship that evening but it  was long finished. She had been the first woman to win the Formula 1  world championship, she was a millionaire, but nonetheless she was  there, in an empty bar, playing joylessly, with an empty glass in front  of her on the black grand piano's top.</em>
<p><em>When she brought to an  end the sonata she was playing a single clap resounded in the room,  surprised she turned and saw Jonathan 'Johnny' Cox sat at the counter.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Wow  Tenoh, you sure are a surprising girl.&quot; He knew she did not like to be  called 'girl' but in that occasion his comment wasn't as sarcastic as  his remarks usually were. &quot;What was that? Some movie soundtrack? I  can't tell which one...&quot; He sure wasn't an expert of classical music.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;It  was Schubert, baka!&quot; She said knowing he wouldn't be able to understand  the last Japanese word. His smirk and reply let out he had at least  realized it wasn't a compliment.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Hey smart-ass, you're  lucky I'm in a good mood...&quot; He said winking at her, she smiled back.  They didn't were close but he had always admired her skills and had a  soft spot for that young racer, Haruka on the other hand liked his  frankness and the fact that he, in the end, treated her just like every  other – male – racer.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Why the good mood? Are you happy to quit, Cox!&quot; She asked quite incredulous. He smiled at her skepticism.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Why  are you surprised about it?&quot; He had just announced he would have quit  racing, he was already forty and his hair was turning gray. &quot;It has to  happen sooner or later... to everyone.&quot; He concluded significantly.  &quot;Enough talking about the old retired racer... Let's talk about the  young world champion moping about alone in an empty bar the same night  of her triumph...&quot; He said, but she didn't answer, so he had to made  her talk himself. &quot;People would wonder what's bothering you, you're  young, rich, famous, attractive, you have lots of girls willing to  spend their nights – and days – with you... instead you're here... with  me. It could seem weird...&quot; She was about to protest but he stopped  with a gesture, &quot;Don't worry Tenoh, I was there years ago... I know how  it feels.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka looked at him intently like she had to decide if he was sincere or not.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Do you know why you won today and did not?&quot; He asked. She was perplexed but answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Cause I was faster than you...&quot; She stated the obvious. He nodded.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Yeah... but... maybe not...&quot; He answered.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Cause  I had more guts than you...&quot; She then answered provocatively and  smirked, but he remained calm and shook his head sighing. &quot;What then?&quot;  She asked eventually with a grunt of impatience.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;Well... cause you </em>think <em>you  have nothing to lose, while I know exactly that I have everything to  lose.&quot; She glance at him confused, so he continued explaining himself.  &quot;I know oh so well those like you... it's obvious </em>someone <em>made you this way, always running away fast as the wind,&quot; He paused emphatically, &quot;and only </em>someone<em> can stop your recklessness.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Haruka was getting angry, she couldn't tolerate such intrusiveness from someone who wanted to psychoanalyzing her.</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;I  know you're pissed, but I'm old enough to not care... Tenoh I like you,  you're a very good racer and a smart girl – even if a little too  arrogant – and I do hope, one day, you'll find someone for whom it'll  be worth slow down a little.&quot; He concluded, then without waiting her  comment he stood, when he was almost out of the room he turned and  added, &quot;You really don't look like the kind of person who play piano,  but you're good at it.&quot; He smiled and was out of the room before she  could anything.</em></p>
<p><em>So she remained there, shoulder slumped,  the white dress shirt unbuttoned at her neck and thinking about who  could made her 'slow down'. </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em>'Such person doesn't exist...' She thought and the sadness that accompanied that thought was surprising even for herself.
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
</em>
</p>
<p>'Such  person... doesn't... exist.' Haruka thought laying sleepless on the  sand, her eyes staring in the dark, in her mind a clear image of a  bright smile and the physical feeling of a warm body against hers...  'I'm so cold...' No one saw her shivering in her pallet.</p>
