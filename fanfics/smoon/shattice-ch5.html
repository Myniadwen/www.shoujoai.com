<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 5 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        Ami Mizuno made her way through the crowd, mostly unaware of 
the stir she generated. Her blue hair was cut boyishly short, going 
well with the dark boy&#39;s school uniform she had been wearing for the 
past few months. Looking up she saw Haruka and Michiru walking 
together, and after a moment of nervousness she picked up her pace.

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Ami smiled over at the two of them slightly as 
she matched her pace with both young women. Their expressions were 
just priceless, both mildly startled by her actions. Ami began to get 
a little worried, wondering if she had misunderstood their invitation 
yesterday, until Michiru smiled at her sunnily.

        &quot;Good Morning, Ami,&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was soft and gentle, her 
waves of green hair flowing around her face..

        &quot;Morning,&quot; Haruka agreed with a crisp nod of her sandy haired 
head, and the three of them walked on together, talking quietly.

        Later that day Michiru stopped by the nurse&#39;s office to visit 
with Setsuna, smiling slightly as she sat across from her and reported 
what had happened that morning. &quot;The whole school&#39;s talking about it,&quot; 
Michiru shook her head, &quot;Ami hasn&#39;t been associating with anyone, so 
her talking to us seems to be big news.&quot;

        &quot;Our Miss Mizuno likes to be unpredictable,&quot; Setsuna noted, 
the black haired woman sitting back a bit in her chair.

        Michiru chuckled softly, &quot;I was waylaid by a small mod of 
young ladies in the ladies room, who seemed rather perturbed I was 
talking to &#39;their&#39; Ami-sama.&quot; She smirked, &quot;That, and they wanted me 
to introduce them to her.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m sure that would go over well,&quot; Setsuna noted as she 
finished preparing some tea.

        Michiru sat forward as her voice dropped a bit to ask, &quot;Have 
you ever seen Ami visit her locker in the morning?&quot;

        Setsuna looked at her curiously, &quot;No.&quot;

        &quot;Love letters,&quot; Michiru smirked, &quot;lots of love letters.&quot;

        A slip of paper was sticking out the slots in the locker&#39;s 
door, and Ami had pulled it out cautiously. Scented, with cute little 
hearts, and in a pink envelope it was clearly a love letter from a 
girl. Blushing furiously Ami had sat it down by her book bag and then 
pulled open the locker door. Dozens of letters cascaded from the 
locker and the blue haired girl scrambled to catch them all as they 
settled around her feet.

        &quot;I was a bit disappointed when she just threw all of the love 
letters out, though,&quot; Michiru said with a cute little pout.

        &quot;That doesn&#39;t really surprise me,&quot; Setsuna took a drink of 
tea, &quot;from what I understand Ami had always been a solitary person 
before she met Usagi and the others, and it&#39;s a pattern of behavior 
she reverted to after their deaths.&quot;

        A little smile appeared on Michiru&#39;s face, &quot;Maybe so, but Ami 
approached us this morning. I&#39;d say she&#39;s making some progress.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad,&quot; Setsuna smiled as the bell rang and Michiru left 
with a wave.

        Ami felt a degree of nervousness as she looked around the gym, 
the fencing gear being distributed to the various students as a small 
crowd settled down in the stands. In her boy&#39;s school uniform she 
limbered up her arm, looking up to see who would be her opponents, and 
sighed as she saw a senior moving through the crowd towards her.

        Haruka raised an eyebrow, &quot;Not happy to see me?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ve seen you fight before,&quot; a smiling Ami said to her dryly, 
&quot;so I&#39;m really not looking forward to losing later on.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ll see,&quot; was Haruka&#39;s smiling answer.

        The teacher briefed them on the rules, then moved to pair them 
off for the initial matches. Ami ended up against a young man, his 
eyes narrowed as he looked at her intensely. &quot;Yes?&quot; Ami raised an 
eyebrow at him.

        &quot;I&#39;m going to enjoy this,&quot; he smirked as he put the face mask 
on.

        Ami raised her foil without answering him, calmly meeting his 
confident gaze until he faltered slightly. She swept in, her sword 
flashing, and made the first point of the match. She focused entirely 
on the match, the rhythm of the flashing swords, and was mildly 
surprised when a voice loudly declared her the winner.

        Michiru smiled to herself slightly as she watched the matches 
continue on. Haruka swiftly rose through the ranks, but quite 
surprisingly Ami was also ascending through the ranks quickly. She 
felt the figure settle beside her and smiled over at Setsuna to softly 
say, &quot;I don&#39;t think Ami realizes just how good she is at this.&quot;

        &quot;We&#39;ve seen how well she handles that sword in battle,&quot; 
Setsuna murmured back, &quot;but I was curious to see if that ability would 
carry over as Ami.&quot;

        Around them a small army of young ladies was watching the 
fencing matches eagerly. Whenever Ami scored a point they sighed 
happily, and if someone actually scored a point on her they looked 
clearly furious. The participants for the final match were called out, 
and they watched as Ami and Haruka walked to the ring together.

        &quot;This could get messy,&quot; Michiru noted. At Setsuna&#39;s frown she 
continued, &quot;Haruka does not like to lose, so she&#39;ll be going all out.&quot;

        &quot;I don&#39;t know Ami that well yet,&quot; Setsuna looked down at Ami 
preparing herself, &quot;but I suspect that much the same applies to her.&quot;

        Haruka smiled slightly, looking over at Ami. &quot;You know, I 
think I was almost expecting this to happen,&quot; she said quietly.

        Ami quite surprisingly smiled, &quot;I wasn&#39;t.&quot; She slid the 
protective face mask on as she added, &quot;May the best woman win.&quot;

        Haruka slid her own mask on, &quot;You got it.&quot;

        Two swords were raised in guard position, and the two stood 
still at statues gazing at each other. They moved suddenly, swords 
flashing, and the blades rang together. Back and forth they moved, 
testing each other with feints and strikes. A touch was made on Ami 
first, then she recovered to score on Haruka in return. They were face 
to face as the swords were tangled together, intently gazing into each 
other&#39;s eyes.

        &quot;You&#39;re good,&quot; Haruka&#39;s voice was soft.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; was Ami&#39;s quiet answer.

        &quot;But not quite good enough,&quot; Haruka moved like a shot, 
tangling Ami&#39;s blade in her own and smoothly forcing it upwards before 
striking to end their tie!

        A long moment of dead silence, then the clapping began. Many 
of the young women seemed sad that Ami had lost, watching worriedly as 
she slid her protective mask off and ran a hand through her short, 
sweaty hair. Wiping that hand on her pants she stepped towards Haruka.

        &quot;Nice move,&quot; Ami offered her hand with a smile.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Haruka shook the hand firmly. She smiled slightly 
down at Ami, &quot;If you want, I can show you that move.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; Ami answered. They walked together towards 
the stands where Setsuna and Michiru were sitting, looking oddly 
relieved. &quot;What?&quot; she asked the two curiously.

        &quot;We were wondering if we were going to have to go over there 
and break up a fight,&quot; Michiru said to them dryly. She smiled slightly 
at Ami, &quot;You took that rather well.&quot;

        &quot;There&#39;s always the next time,&quot; Ami answered serenely.

        &quot;I should have guessed,&quot; Setsuna murmured. She looked at Ami, 
&quot;I was wondering where you developed your gift for the sword?&quot;

        Ami&#39;s face seemed to shut down. Quietly she said, &quot;I didn&#39;t. I 
seem to have received the skills when I was given Endymion&#39;s sword.&quot; 
There was a long moment of silence, then Ami continued &quot;I&#39;d better go 
shower before my next class.&quot;

        &quot;Open mouth, insert foot,&quot; Setsuna murmured as Ami quietly 
walked away.

        Michiru took Haruka&#39;s hand in her own, squeezing it gently as 
Ami disappeared into the locker room. She looked thoughtful, &quot;If 
Endymion gave her those fighting skills, I wonder if the other Senshi 
might have granted her certain gifts as well?&quot;

        &quot;Good question,&quot; Haruka mused.
