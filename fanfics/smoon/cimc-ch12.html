<h1>Come into My Chamber (part 12 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/cimc-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Madame Butterfly filtered through the expensive apartment, decorated 
oddly, abstract sculpture on one side, French Impressionist art on the 
other. Red and black, bright, angry colors in some rooms, neutrals, 
beige, brown, gray, and white in others. For some reason, it seemed to 
fit. The air was lightly scented with perfume and roses. An Asian woman, 
tall, poised, sat on a comfortable looking couch, half-asleep, flipping 
a cell-phone in the air with one hand, arranging red roses in a 
hand-blown vase with the other. The opera continued. The girl rolled her 
eyes. 

&quot;It&#39;s not the first time you&#39;ve lost one of those freaks. Stop being a 
drama-queen.&quot; 

The sound of heels clicking in another room, the shuffling of cloth. The 
song changed, a piano solo. 

&quot;Cut it out,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Stop moping. We&#39;ll find them again.&quot; 

&quot;Not the point, Celeste. Failure is not an option.&quot; The second voice was 
colder, slightly hinted with an Italian accent. She pronounced her words 
carefully, as if she played around with them in her mouth before she 
spoke them. 

&quot;I don&#39;t answer people who talk to me from other rooms,&quot; Celeste said. 
She looked and sounded bored, played with a silver bracelet on her arm, 
watched it flicker against the light. 

A curse in some sort of foreign language, then angry, quick steps into 
the living room. Celeste stopped arranging the flowers, stopped playing 
with her phone. She stared at the woman in front of her. 

&quot;The dead has arisen,&quot; she drawled. &quot;Done beating yourself up?&quot; 

&quot;Quite. Thank you for your backwards, yet well-meaning concern. Have 
they called?&quot; Celeste shook her head, the other woman sat down, crossing 
her long legs in front of her. Celeste wore black slacks, a red shirt, a 
black jacket, deceptively simple, but more than likely incredibly 
expensive. Her silver jewelry, bracelets, rings, a necklace, tinkled at 
any slight movement, played an odd, discordant song. She tapped her 
boots on the wood floor. One, two, three taps. It matched the melody of 
her bracelets. She was only an inch shorter than the other woman, but 
toned, stronger. Her eyes, an odd mix of gold and silver, flickered like 
fire, warm and cold. She hummed a song, and the other woman leaned 
against the couch. Her skirt hiked up slightly, she sniffed and pulled 
it back into place. 

&quot;I do hate skirts,&quot; she said. 

&quot;Why are you still dressed like that? The meeting ended hours ago,&quot; 
Celeste muttered. She had slipped out of her own work clothes as soon as 
the meeting ended. She hated business meetings, so boring. It took all 
her power to keep awake, to continue listening to those droning 
middle-aged men talk to her as if she was too stupid to understand 
anything. She was no dippy secretary. She was a powerhouse, and damn 
proud of it. 

&quot;Because we&#39;ll probably have another soon.&quot; This woman was dressed for 
work, black business suit, crisp, off-white shirt, her long brown hair 
up in a severe bun. She wore a watch, and a necklace, both gold, 
decorated with tiny diamonds. She seemed to be more fine-boned than 
Celeste, with high cheekbones, a long neck, cold golden eyes. Her skin 
was darker, like mocha. Her cell phone was silver, sleek against her 
hip. Wire framed glasses, used more for show than actual need, sat at 
the tip of her nose. The cell phone on her hip vibrated, she jumped 
slightly, then answered. 

&quot;SpYder Incorporated, C&amp;M Division, Mia Repiamseu speaking. Yes. I 
understand. Thank you.&quot; The call ended, she smiled and leaned against 
the couch. Curiosity tugged at Celeste and she frowned, forced to take 
the bait. 

&quot;What happened?&quot; Mia turned to face her friend, her eyes glittered. She 
looked absolutely giddy. 

&quot;The queen has returned.&quot; Celeste groaned, rubbed her temples. 

&quot;Jesus pogosticking fucking Christ. Great. Now on top of Demando&#39;s 
grunts, we have to deal with the crazy bitches.&quot; 

&quot;Such language,&quot; Mia laughed, spun around. &quot;Don&#39;t you get it? We&#39;ll have 
more fun than we did in college.&quot; 

&quot;I dumped a lot of guys in college. I um, studied. I don&#39;t know what you 
did.&quot; Celeste raised an eyebrow. &quot;What did you do?&quot; 

Mia scoffed. She almost seemed to pout. &quot;Well, that&#39;s no fun.&quot; Celeste 
gawked at her. 

&quot;Did you do drugs?&quot; 

&quot;Heaven&#39;s, no!&quot; 

&quot;Did you drink?&quot; 

&quot;Rarely.&quot; 

Celeste thought for a moment. Then she cringed, covered her face with a 
pillow. &quot;You freak. You are such a freak. That&#39;s why you don&#39;t date 
anymore.&quot; 

Mia laughed. &quot;Well, I lived in a boarding school half my life. I had to 
do something with all that free time. Sowing my wild oats and all that.&quot; 

Celeste threw a pillow at her. &quot;Who gave you the hint?&quot; 

Mia threw the pillow back. &quot;A private caller. Name didn&#39;t show up on my 
caller ID.&quot; 

Celeste caught the pillow. &quot;Is the voice familiar?&quot; 

&quot;Not really.&quot; 

&quot;You should have tracked the call.&quot; 

&quot;The call was five seconds. And what are we, the CIA?&quot; 

&quot;We&#39;re better. We&#39;re big business.&quot; 

&quot;Hm. Are we working tonight?&quot; 

&quot;Let Her Majesty get settled in. Plus, I have a headache. That 
meeting...all that cigar smoke. How can you stand it?&quot; 

&quot;I smoked once. Cigarettes. A casual thing. Do it sometimes, every once 
in a blue moon, to ease my nerves.&quot; 

&quot;Ugh. If I die of second-hand smoke, I&#39;ll haunt you for the rest of your 
life.&quot; 

&quot;You&#39;ll be too busy with your brutal takeover of Hell to pay me any 
mind.&quot; 

&quot;Touch&eacute;.&quot; 

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~ 

&quot;Are you comfortable?&quot; 

Silence. 

Demando frowned, raking his fingers through his short, silver hair. 
Apparently Serenity did not see the need to speak to him. She would have 
to eventually. &quot;Perhaps you would like something to drink?&quot; 

Nothing. Her followers had acknowledged him, even spoke, referred to him 
as &quot;Lord.&quot; But he had seen that their sincerity did not reach their 
eyes, that there was irony laced in those polite tones. No matter, he 
did not need their approval centuries ago; he did not need it now. But 
Serenity was different. She was special. He had not wanted to hurt her 
guest, to destroy her home, but it was necessary to escape. Serenity 
fled when she had somewhere to go. If she did not, then she would stay. 
At least, he hoped so. He smiled at her, and was not surprised when she 
did not return it. 

&quot;I gave you your own room, as you can see. Your er, your girls have 
their own rooms as well...unless they requested to share.&quot; The two older 
vampires, Setsuna and Kazuki had. He had given it to them without 
batting an eyelid. Such things were not unheard of in their groups, 
usually, it was encouraged. Once bonded, vampires grew stronger, strong 
enough to destroy hunters easily. But just in case, he had asked his own 
followers to watch those two. Setsuna was older than he was, considered 
an ancient among them, and he had seen the almost murderous look her 
younger mate had given him. Wisdom and motive were dangerous together; 
he had learned that long ago. 

&quot;Your room has roses,&quot; he continued. &quot;I remember that you liked roses. 
White and red, if I recall? I put others, pink in some places as well.&quot; 
Still she was quiet. He counted backwards in his head to quell his 
frustration. &quot;Your room is pink. Pale pink.&quot; A pause. &quot;I even had 
someone get you a pet. A black cat. I haven&#39;t given her a name; I 
reserved that honor for you.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; 

Demando blinked in surprise, and then smiled. Finally, she spoke. 

&quot;You&#39;re welcome. Perhaps you would like to join me for dinner?&quot; 

&quot;Perhaps later.&quot; She stared off into space. &quot;I&#39;m not very hungry right 
now.&quot; 

Demando tried not to sigh in disappointment. &quot;Very well. I&#39;ll have a 
servant see you to your room.&quot; With a swish of his cream-colored cloak, 
he departed, leaving Serenity to her thoughts. 

&quot;Thank you.&quot; She idly ran her fingers across the spot where Rei had shot 
her, and barely blinked when she heard the door shut quietly behind her. 

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~ 

&quot;Well...&quot; Ami took a deep, shuddering breath. &quot;That was educational.&quot; 

&quot;Disturbing.&quot; Rei muttered. She closed the book, and yawned, brushing 
stray bangs out of her face. Tired violet eyes came to rest on Mitsuki. 

&quot;You think we should go look for them?&quot; Mitsuki blinked, startled. 

&quot;Well, I mean...is it safe? Can&#39;t we just leave them alone?&quot; She wrung 
her hands nervously, and Rei scoffed. 

&quot;Do what you want. As soon as I get out of here, I&#39;m looking. I bet 
they&#39;re still in Tokyo.&quot; 

&quot;Why can&#39;t you just leave well enough alone?&quot; Ami muttered, exasperated. 

&quot;That&#39;s not the way I function. Besides, even though she&#39;s nuts, 
Serenity is nothing compared to this Demando guy, from what I&#39;ve heard. 
I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if he wanted to start some kind of revolution, 
an uprising of vampires. He&#39;s dangerous. To win a chess game, you have 
to capture the King.&quot; 

Mitsuki bit her lip, and solemnly replied, 

&quot;But the Queen is the most dangerous piece of all. She&#39;s the strongest, 
she has all the power of every piece combined. The King needs his 
defenders. The Queen only needs herself. When you think about it, she 
could easily control the entire game.&quot; 

Rei had nothing to say to that. 

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~ 

If I was wrong about that chess reference, don&#39;t hesitate to tell me. I 
suck at chess, but from what I remember, the Queen is one badass piece. 
Also, I&#39;d like to credit the character Celeste to my friend Etherealist. 
Usually her character goes around brutally murdering sorcerers, but I 
thought she&#39;d have a lot of fun putting that energy into vampire 
hunting. By the way, if you&#39;re into vampires and the art of killing 
them, check out her FFVIII fanfic. Her fight scenes are really amazing.
