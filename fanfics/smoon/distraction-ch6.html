<p>“<em>Do  you have to leave so soon?” asked Rei.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Of  course, I have to continue the tour. I only came back for Usagi’s  wedding,” replied Minako as she neatly folded one of her skirts  into her suitcase. Rei could only sit quietly on the couch and stare  outside the window. </em>Only for the wedding? <em>thought the miko as,  she felt a slight annoyance towards Minako once again.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Besides,”  continued the idol, “Aren’t you also leaving town? To continue  training in Kyoto as you have told me.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Mm,”  replied Rei.</em></p>
<p>“<em>What  are you’re plans after you’ve completed the training?” </em></p>
<p>“<em>Well,  maybe by the time I return, I’ll be able to take care of the  shrine. It’s my home and I can’t leave it behind. So…when will  the famous </em>Aino Minako<em> finish her almighty touring around the  globe?”</em></p>
<p><em>There  was a sense of sarcasm in the tone of Rei’s voice, but Minako  dismissed it easily.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I’m  not sure,” replied the idol as she walked back to her closet to  grab more clothes. After a few moments of silence, she turned back to  Rei with a smile on her face, “I know. How about we do something  before we go our separate ways. Just you and me.”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei  looked curious now as she turned away from the window, “Hm?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Amusement  park….”</em></p>
<p>“Rei?  Rei? REI!!” exclaimed Usagi as she waved her hand in front of the  miko’s face. Rei felt something cold trickling down her fingers and  she looked down at her melted ice cream cone. Ami handed the miko a  napkin to wipe her hand. Motoki, who had met up with the girls, was  over at a booth and he tried valiantly to win a prize for Makoto, who  watched from behind with Minako. After missing a few shots, Makoto  stepped in and threw the last ball, which hit the target perfectly.  Motoki shrugged when they were given an enormous stuffed turtle.</p>
<p>As Ami  accompanied Usagi to the stand to obtain more food, the other three  were making their way towards Rei. The miko got up from her seat and  tossed the cone into the trashcan. They passed through the crowd and  rejoined Usagi, whose face was suddenly hidden behind a whole wad of  cotton candy.</p>
<p>“So,  anything you want to check out?” asked Makoto.</p>
<p>“As  long as I don’t have to be in an enclosed space,” replied Motoki  nervously.</p>
<p>Taking  Motoki’s comment in consideration, they decided to ride the Ferris  wheel. Due to mixture of who should be paired up, Rei once again  ended with Minako. <em>This is starting to become an annoying trend,</em> she thought as she glanced up at the compartment Motoki and Makoto  were seated. They were slowly ascending and getting a better view of  the city below them.</p>
<p>When the  ride was over, Usagi looked around the area scouting for something  lighter and fun, while Ami pointed towards the carousel. She pulled  her friend towards the direction while everyone trailed behind. As  they made their way to the carousel, Rei could not help but stop in  front a souvenir stand. Amongst the t-shirts that hung along the  racks and little trinkets that were placed beneath the glass, Rei  spotted a familiar cap. Her thoughts began to drift away once more.</p>
<p>“<em>I  refuse,” said the miko sternly.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Why?  It looks so cute on you,” replied Minako as she grabbed Rei’s arm  and led her towards the small mirror, “See? Fits you perfectly.”</em></p>
<p><em>The  miko grimaced at the amount of glitter one cap could hold. On top of  that, it had bright pink stitches sewed along the black tip. Rei  slowly took it off her head, looked at it and then at Minako. “My  answer is still the same. No.” </em></p>
<p><em>Placing  the cap back into the stand, Rei walked away with her hands in her  pockets. Minako sighed and joined the miko in her march. The idol  quickly grabbed her arm and Rei felt her pulse quicken at Minako’s  touch.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Come  on, let’s ride the carousel….” </em></p>
<p>Rei  snapped back into reality when she heard the voices of her friends  calling to her. She looked past the crowd and found everyone, except  Minako, waving cheerfully from their ride. The miko surveyed the area  and spotted the idol walking towards her.</p>
<p>“Find  something here?” asked Minako.</p>
<p>“Nothing,”  replied Rei as she began to walk away from the stand.</p>
<p>“Hold  on,” said idol as she picked up something familiar, “Do you  remember this?”</p>
<p>Rei  looked back and found Minako holding the very cap from the last time  they visited the stand. The miko sighed and then rolled her eyes as  she took the cap from Minako and looked at it.</p>
<p>“How  could I forget? You were practically forcing it on my head.”</p>
<p>“It was  cute on you.”</p>
<p>“I  hated it… and I still do,” replied Rei as she gave the cap back  to the idol. The miko walked back towards the carousel and stood  behind the metal fence that allowed her to wave back at her friends.  She suddenly felt someone shove something on her head, and Rei could  not help but fling her arms and quickly turned around. Minako was  standing with her hands behind her back and smiling at Rei.</p>
<p>“It  still looks cute on you,” replied the idol.</p>
<p>“Why  did you buy it?” asked Rei as she looked at the familiar stitches.</p>
<p>“I  never had the chance to do so last time.”</p>
<p>Rei was  about to oppose but felt someone hit the tip of the cap, causing the  miko to loose her vision under it.</p>
<p>“Hey!  What’s the big deal?!” she frowned as she lifted the cap.</p>
<p>“It  suits you perfectly. Keep it on,” replied Makoto.</p>
<p>Rei  looked around and realized that the ride had ended and her friends,  who had taken notice of what she was wearing, now surrounded her.  Usagi walked up to them and then tilted her head.</p>
<p>“Rei,  is that <em>you</em> under that?” asked Usagi as she inched closer to  the miko.</p>
<p>“Don’t  even say a word.”</p>
<p>“Hey,  how about we take a group shot. We haven’t done so since Rei and  Minako arrived,” said Makoto as she handed her camera to Motoki.</p>
<p>Minako  grabbed Rei’s arm and tilted her head towards the miko while  flashing the V-sign. Usagi grabbed both Makoto and Ami while the  doctor gave a nervous look at the camera. Rei looked at Minako for a  moment, wondering how she had gotten into this situation.</p>
<p>“Rei,  look at the camera!” exclaimed Motoki.</p>
<p>The miko  glanced back towards where he was waving and frowned. Makoto gave Rei  a little nudge, which made the miko frown even more as she glared  back at her friend. Minako looked at the miko with a puzzled face and  then laughed. She let go of Rei’s arm and then shifted behind her.</p>
<p>“You  have to smile…like this,” whispered Minako as she placed her  hands on Rei’s cheeks and pulled them up to force a smile upon  Rei’s face. The idol was so close that it caught Rei off guard. Her  eyes widened as Motoki quickly snapped the picture. The flash seemed  to engulf Rei’s sight and she froze in her spot. She quickly pushed  away from Minako, and placed her own hands upon where the idol had  just touched. Her facial expression was blank. Being in the amusement  park brought back too many memories, and the moment Minako had placed  her hands on the miko’s cheek, Rei could not help but recall some  of them.</p>
<p>“<em>Don’t  go,” said Rei with a pleading look.</em></p>
<p><em>They  were back in Minako’s hotel, passing through a few people in the  lobby as they made their way into the elevator. .</em></p>
<p>“<em>I  have to Rei. If I want to keep up with this career then this is my  choice,” replied Minako as she looked at the miko. Suddenly being  approached by a middle school girl holding a notebook and marker.  Minako smiled and signed the notebook, later bidding the girl a  goodbye and walking along with Rei once again.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Why…why  do you have to always base things on your career? If it’s not about  the past life, it’s living as an idol.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You  also have </em>your <em>career to worry about. I wish it were as simple  as quitting.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>So  do it then. Quit. Live a normal life for a change. What if…what if  it wasn’t </em>just<em> the stresses of being a senshi that caused  you to…in the past when you.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>When  I what?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You  already know what I am talking about! Don’t pretend like it didn’t  happen.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Technically,  it didn’t. When Usagi revived us, that tumor never existed.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>What  if there is a chance that it might…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Rei,  stop worrying. It’s behind us now. I’m still here see?” The  idol displayed her happiest smile as she cocked her head towards the  idol and flashed a victory sign.</em></p>
<p><em>Rei  put on a sour face and looked away from the idol. She wanted to tell  her at that moment how she really felt but with their being in a  public area; she did not have the courage too. </em>Coward,<em> she  thought inwardly to herself.</em></p>
<p>“<em>In  two years, I’ll be back and maybe by then you’ll be an expert  from your training in Kyoto.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Two  years is a long time.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Don’t  worry so much. Why such a sad face?” asked the idol as they were  inside the elevator, “You know Rei, you should really smile. Like  this.” Minako slowly placed her hand on Rei’s cheeks and forced a  smile on her gloomy face.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Minako!”  exclaimed the miko.</em></p>
<p>“Rei?  What’s wrong?” asked Usagi.</p>
<p>The miko  was flushed, “N-nothing, it just startled me that’s all. It was a  bad idea coming here. ”</p>
<p>Rei  slowly turned around and began to hastily walk away from the group,  later breaking into a run.</p>
<p>“Rei!  We were just playing around! Rei!” yelled Usagi as she tried to run  after the miko. Makoto stopped Usagi, and Minako ran past them,  chasing after her best friend.</p>
<p>“Rei!  Stop!” bid Minako, but the miko would not listen. <em>Kami-sama!  What are they training her in Kyoto? Thank goodness I decided to wear  sneakers today, </em>thought the idol as she broke into a sprint.</p>
<p>As Rei  heard Minako calling out to her, she dug her shoes deeper against the  gravel to increase her momentum. <em>I can’t deal with this right  now. I can’t deal with </em>her<em> right now.</em></p>
<p>“Rei!  You’re being silly! Stop already!” yelled Minako who was nearly  out of breath. She tried to keep up with the miko’s pace and  refused to give up on Rei easily. <em>Not this time, </em>thought the  idol as she quickened her pace. She was merely a hand’s reach from  the miko and was about to grab Rei’s sleeve. The miko felt the idol  inching closer, and then heard a thump on the ground behind her.</p>
<p>“Itai!”</p>
<p>Rei felt  a sense of dread overwhelm her gut as she stopped in her footsteps  and turned around. Minako tumbled on the ground and was now sitting  on the sidewalk, clutching her ankle. The miko ran back to the idol  and kneeled in front of her. First, Rei checked if she was okay.  Minako winced in pain and her head was spinning. She was unsure if it  was because the lack of oxygen from the amount of running they had  just done, or the fact that she had injured herself after missing to  grab Rei’s sleeve. <em>I should have just thrown a rock at her! </em>she  thought as she clutched her ankle tightly.</p>
<p>“BAKA!!  How can you be so clumsy?! Why do you always have to follow me!”  yelled Rei as she looked at Minako’s swelling ankle.</p>
<p>“Well,  I didn’t want to give you the victory to getting away from me the  second time…plus if I recall it well, <em>you </em>were the one who  kept following me back when we were teenagers. I thought, I’d  return the favor – ITAI!!” cried out the idol as Rei began to put  pressure on her ankle.</p>
<p>“Calm  down, I’m trying to make sure it’s not broken.”</p>
<p>Rei  looked around the area. If she was correct, they both ran a good  distance away from the amusement park, and there was no way they were  heading back in that direction with Minako in her current state.</p>
<p>“Come  on, the shrine is not too far from here,” ordered Rei.</p>
<p>“I  think that will be a problem,” replied Minako as her head swayed.</p>
<p>The miko  sighed and then grabbed one of Minako’s arms and threw it over her  shoulder.</p>
<p>“Wha..what  are you doing?”</p>
<p>“If you  can’t walk, the only thing I can do is to carry you on my  back…unfortunately,” she added.</p>
<p>Rei  picked the idol from the ground and began to walk towards the shrine.  She could feel the warmth of her friend against her back, and hear  the idol breathe in and out. <em>I can’t believe I’m doing this!!</em> she thought angrily, <em>At least she’s not heavy.</em></p>
<p>Minako  rested her head on the miko’s shoulders as her arms wrapped around  Rei’s neck. Despite the idol’s head spinning and ears ringing,  Rei’s perfume drifted into her nostrils. A slight hint of incense  lingered on the miko’s clothes, and Minako could not help but  silently laugh at the situation. It must be an awkward sight seeing  Rei carrying a pop idol on her back.</p>
<p>As they  made their way through the empty streets, Minako could only listen to  silence. It was a familiar silence that caused a great deal of  awkwardness between the two girls. The idol could not see the  expression in Rei’s face, but she already knew the miko had a frown  plastered in her face. Minako tightened her grip on the miko. This  was probably going to be the only time she’ll be this close to her.</p>
<p>They  reached the shrine and Rei made her way into her room, allowing  Minako to settle on the floor as she brought out a futon.</p>
<p>“I  really have no choice but to allow you stay here. Do you have your  cell phone with you?” asked the miko.</p>
<p>Minako  dug into her pockets and realized that she must have left it in  Usagi’s house before arriving at the shrine to pick up the miko  earlier that day. She sighed and then shook her head. Rei got up and  then helped Minako into the futon.</p>
<p>“I’ll  be back,” she said as she walked away and then closed the door  behind her.</p>
<p>Walking  down the dimly lit hallway, Rei entered the office. She reached out  to the phone and then started to dial Ami’s number.</p>
<p>“Ami-chan,  it’s me.”</p>
<p>“Kami-sama!  Rei-chan! Where are you guys? We were worried sick scouting the area  for you! Do you know how late it is?!”</p>
<p>“Gomen,  I’m at the shrine and I need you to come here.”</p>
<p>“Something  wrong? Rei-chan, you’ve been acting strange lately. Running off  like that. Is it because–”</p>
<p>“I  don’t want to talk about it right now. Minako fell and injured her  ankle.”</p>
<p>“Eh?!”</p>
<p>“How  fast can you get here? She’s feeling pretty out of it.”</p>
<p>“With  Mako-chan’s driving, maybe in a few minutes. In the mean time,  place some ice on her ankle, keep it leveled and give her some  painkillers if necessary. I’ll see you soon, ja.”</p>
<p>The miko  made her way into the medicine cabinet, and glanced at the different  bottles that sat on the shelves. She was not amazed by the amounts of  herbs that were stored inside, due to the fact that she has used some  of them in the past. She suddenly spotted a bottle of codeine and  picked it up. Reading the label, she realized that it was the bottle  prescribed to her after she was badly injured by Mio. Rei sighed and  saw that it was not yet expired. She made her way back into her room  and found the idol’s back turned towards the door. Minako turned  around, her forehead soaked in sweat as she smiled weakly to the  miko. Rei sat down and helped her sit up.</p>
<p>“Here.  I’m pretty sure it’s hurting right now,” said Rei as she placed  an ice pack on the idol’s swelling ankle and then handed her a  glass of water. The miko felt Minako’s forehead and sighed as she  handed two pills towards the idol, “You’re starting to have a  fever. Here, take this.”</p>
<p>“Rei,  you’re not trying to drug me are you?” joked Minako as swallowed  the pills and took a gulp of water.</p>
<p>“Don’t  kid yourself. Ami is on her way, just stay here.”</p>
<p>Rei was  about to get up and Minako felt a mesh of colors swirl her. The  medicine was working quite well. She reached out to the miko and  grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>“What  now?!”</p>
<p>“  ‘Don’t go.’ ” quoted Minako as she started at the ceiling,  “If I recall it well, you said those words to me the last time we  were in Tokyo.”</p>
<p>“And  what of it?” asked the miko as she turned around.</p>
<p>Minako  sat up once more and looked directly into the eyes of her friend.  They were soft yet piercing when she was angry. “I never forgot  about you, and I came back for that reason. It’s my turn to tell  you know, don’t go. Stay here.”</p>
<p>Rei never  broke their eye contact and gave in. She shook her head.</p>
<p>“Baka.  Those painkillers are working quite well. Are you <em>that </em>afraid  to be left alone? Maybe if you just –”</p>
<p>Minako  immediately took the miko in her arms and held her there tightly.  Rei’s eyes widened as she felt the idol lightly pressed against  her. Still unsure about how she would react, Rei froze in her spot,  and Minako could only hold her in her arms. Finally, the miko slowly  returned the embrace. The idol felt the Rei soften a bit and she  smiled at this realization.</p>
<p>“Maybe  it <em>is</em> the medication doing it’s job. Maybe I’m just crazy  but, I missed you Rei. I missed you so much,” whispered Minako as  she felt herself slowly drifting into a deep sleep. The miko could  not say anything witty to respond to what the idol had just  confessed. Deep inside, Rei knew that she felt the same way. She  missed Minako terribly. There were times when she would be distracted  during her training just having the idol linger in her mind. That was  what Kaori-sensei had sensed, and no matter how many times Rei tried  to erase Minako from her mind, she still would be lingering there.  Minako was Rei’s distraction.</p>
