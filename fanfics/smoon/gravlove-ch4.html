<h1>Gravity of Love (part 4 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Rei stormed down the street. Hard to be inconspicuous and blend in when 
the dangerous aura coming from you made people stay far away.

She entered an alley and leaned against the wall. Closing her dark eyes, 
the assassin took a deep breath and without thinking took out a pack of 
cigarettes. Lighting one and taking a long drag, she opened her eyes and 
looked up at the dark sky.

Damn it, why was she being so emotional right now? How many people has 
she killed? Hundreds. Mother, husbands, cousins, sisters and 
grandparents. How many people has she taken to bed? Whores, sluts, male 
prostitutes, charming businessmen, in control businesswomen, clubbers 
and cute high school girls. Really, the list goes on and on.

Yet a simple girl gets to her. Not ANY girl, a girl she&#39;s been hired to 
kidnap and eventually kill. Seriously, who hires an assassin without the 
desire of having someone &quot;taken care of?&quot;

When she first heard it was Tsukino&#39;s daughter, she was a bit happy, 
really. Though difficult, she could pull it off and get quite a bit of 
money for it. Besides, the daughter of a bastard like Ken Tsukino had to 
be a little spoiled bitch. Right? A snot nosed slob that thought she 
could get away with anything. She would be doing the world a favor by 
kidnapping her.

Then she met Minako. It was just part of the job. The singer began to 
change her mind about Tsukino&#39;s kid. She dismissed it as a cousin being 
nice and besides, it was good spending time with a beauty like Aino and 
still be &quot;working.&quot; She did feel sorry for using her, but anything for a 
job.

Then she met her target. Damn, was she wrong. A smile that could 
brighten anyone&#39;s day and those god damn big, innocent blue eyes of 
hers. Weird how Minako and Serena could have the same features but have 
completely different kind of beauty.

What the fuck was she thinking about? Damn, Tsukino must have affected 
her more than she thought. Maybe if she went back to being the bitch she 
was, everything will be fine.

Rei swore as she flicked the bud of the cigarette to the ground.

The damn promise.

What the fuck was she on when she made that? But Serena wasn&#39;t even 
awake when she made it so maybe...

She swore again loudly.

She never had broken promises, ever.

Fuck.

~*~*~*

Serena shifted. Her arms and legs were sore while her mouth was dry. 
It&#39;s been at least 18 hours since Rei left. It was midnight already for 
god&#39;s sake.

&#39;Oh, when she comes back, I&#39;m gonna give her hell!&#39;

Just then, the door slammed open. Serena&#39;s eyes hardened as she glared 
at the dark figure in the doorway.

&quot;Whores work hard for their money!&quot;

Blue eyes widened as she heard the assassin&#39;s slurred singing. Before 
anything could settle in, Rei staggered into the room and over to 
Serena&#39;s bed.

&quot;Hello, gorgeous!&quot;

Serena wrinkled her nose at Rei&#39;s breath, heavy with the smell of 
alcohol and cigarettes. Violet eyes looked at the ropes that bound her 
arms.

&quot;Oh, ooooops. I ferg&#39;t &#39;bout those!&quot;

The blonde felt the blood drain from her face when she saw the assassin 
pull out a knife. With fast and surprisingly accurate swipes, her hands 
were freed.

Serena took the gag from her mouth and gasped for breath. She rubbed her 
wrists and grabbed the keys for the cuffs on her feet off the table and 
quickly undid them.

&quot;Y&#39;know, Serena, I made a promise I ain&#39;t gonna be able ta keep,&quot; the 
drunk assassin slurred as she collapsed onto her bed.

Serena stood quickly and scrambled for the door. This was her chance. 
She can just run right now and go call the police. They&#39;d be there in 
seconds and this nightmare would all be over.

&quot;Where d&#39;ya &#39;ink yer goin&#39;?&quot;

The blonde woman turned quickly to face her captor, fear coursing 
through her veins. The assassin was face down on the bed, half 
unconscious.

&quot;I&#39;m going to get you some tea.&quot;

Serena struggled to keep her voice level, but failed somewhat miserable. 
Fortunately, Rei was too drunk to notice.

&quot;Oh, shanks.&quot;

Blue eyes closed for a split second before opening as the blonde headed 
for the door. A groan came from the half passed out woman on the bed, 
causing her to stop at the doorway. She couldn&#39;t just leave her like 
this...

&#39;Of course you can! She KIDNAPPED you moron!&#39;

~Yeah, but...~

&#39;Shut up and run!&#39;

Serena listened to the voices and started to walk out the door again. 
Then Rei spoke, barely coherent.

&quot;Ya know, I feel kinda bad &#39;bout kidnapping ya, since yer being much 
nicer dan ya hav&#39;ta!&quot;

Serena squeezed her eyes shut. No! Shut up! She wasn&#39;t supposed to feel 
bad about escaping! She was supposed to be happy to get away from this 
hellhole and run back to the safety of her family. Her kidnapper was 
supposed to be abusing her and not be telling her how she feels guilty. 
Damn it, Rei wouldn&#39;t even be telling her this shit if she wasn&#39;t drunk.

&quot;You&#39;re not even running.&quot;

Guilt decided to make its home permanently in her heart, causing her 
stomach to start doing flips. Hell, it was even worse since the 
assassin&#39;s words weren&#39;t even slurred together anymore. She sounded 
perfectly sober. Too sober for Serena&#39;s tastes.

&quot;Anyone else would run, but yer differen&#39;.&quot;

No. She&#39;s not. She didn&#39;t know the blonde. Far from it.

&quot;Everyone else would run. They wouldn&#39;t even care I could die if they 
escaped.&quot;

She... could... die? But she&#39;s a killer. Who the hell would be dumb 
enough to mess with The Raven? It&#39;s a trick. To get her to stay and feel 
guilty. Damn bitch must know enough about her to know she&#39;s a sucker for 
those emotions. Especially guilt.

&quot;People dun know da price we assassins pay, ya know wah I&#39;m sayin&#39;? 
Ain&#39;t all killin&#39; n guns.&quot;

Serena turned around, emotions rooting her to the spot. Rei must be 
smashed, though she could pretty much tell that already. But to be 
telling her all this? Fuck it, why couldn&#39;t she be sober like the good 
like kidnapper&#39;s supposed to be? Now, if only she&#39;ll stop talking.

&quot;You&#39;re lucky I have more control than most. Any utha&#39;ssassin wuld&#39;a 
raped ya&#39;lready an-&quot;

Rei suddenly stopped. As Serena looked closer, she realized the assassin 
was passed out.

Serena just stood there, leaning slightly against the doorframe. Well, 
that was quite the load of information the drunken woman just told her.

Anyone else would have raped her.

Well, it doesn&#39;t surprise her much. So, where the hell does that leave 
her?

The blonde pressed a finger between her eyes, feeling the migraine built 
up. On one hand, she should be running for her life right now. Because 
that&#39;s what it came down to. Her life. If she stays, she&#39;ll most likely 
lose it. If she ran, she&#39;d be able to get away from this and end it.

But Rei will die.

And did she care? Yes. She always will. No one deserves to die, even an 
assassin. She&#39;d most likely give them hell about it from what she can 
see, but that doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t lose her life.

Serena sighed before shutting the door and walking over to the passed 
out woman on the bed. She took off her leather jacket and other clothes 
before dressing the other woman in a large shirt she found in the 
duffle. Despite the situation, the blonde remembered to blush when she 
took off the tight jeans of the lean woman.

Getting a hand towel from the bathroom and wetting it with hot water, 
she wiped Rei&#39;s face. Her fingers brushed against the flawless skin. She 
thought all assassins were supposed to be butch men with scars. Well, 
they weren&#39;t.

With another blush, she wiped the long neck, forcing herself not to even 
look any lower. The hands were next before the towel was placed on the 
nightstand.

Why the hell was she still here? Has she finally gone insane? 
Apparently, Minako really wasn&#39;t joking when she told her cousin her 
feelings would be her downfall one day.

But it wasn&#39;t only that. It was something about Rei. Something that made 
her stay. Whatever it is, it went against logic and all rational 
thought.

Blue eyes gazed at the relaxed face of her personal hell. She looked so 
damn peaceful. A hand unconsciously reached out and brushed the silky 
raven bangs from the closed violet eyes. Maybe one day, she&#39;ll know why 
Rei was who she was.

With a slight smile and her rational side screaming bloody murder, 
Serena climbed onto her bed and pulled the covers over her petite form.

~*~*~*

Rei groaned and sat up. Dizziness hit her like a tidal wave as her hand 
instinctive went to her head.

&quot;What the f-&quot;

Before she could finish, she felt the alcohol from last night coming 
right back up. Without another word, she bolted into the bathroom.

Serena&#39;s eyes fluttered open. What WAS that sound? It didn&#39;t take the 
blonde long to realize it was vomiting. She heard it enough from her 
cousin to identity it.

She stood and walked over to the bathroom door, which was open. Blue 
eyes peered inside, spotting the limp form of the assassin hanging onto 
the toilet for dear life.

Minutes later, the violet-eyed woman slowly rose to her unsteady feet. 
Knowing that Rei would be highly embarrassed to be caught barfing her 
brains out, Serena turned and walked back to her bed.

Rei emerged minutes later, her dark hair all over the place, skin pale 
and clammy while dark rings bad their home under her sharp eyes. The 
assassin basically looked like she&#39;s been through hell and back... 
several times within the last few hours. The bed creaked when she 
collapsed on it.

A cup appeared in her line of vision and as a result her violet eyes 
followed the arm up to the face that smiled softly at her. She sat up, 
her entire body protesting but she didn&#39;t make it known. A shaking hand 
reached forward to take the cup from the blonde when it stopped.

&quot;Is it coffee...?&quot;

Serena wrinkled her nose and frowned softly. &quot;Coffee does nothing for 
hangovers.&quot;

Rei smiled softly and took the offered cup. It was cradled in her lap 
for a few seconds before being brought up to the ruby lips. The assassin 
suddenly groaned and quickly placed the tea on the nightstand. The other 
hand flew up to her head.

Serena leaned forward, concern written all over her features. But she 
paused and crossed her arms. No, this was the woman that kidnapped her. 
Just because she didn&#39;t escape, undressed her, made her feel comfortable 
last night and got her tea DOESN&#39;T mean she&#39;s going to take care of her.

&quot;What,&quot; she began curiously, &quot;did you drink?&quot;

Rei shook her head, trying to piece everything together. &quot;A couple of 
beers, a shot or six of vodka, some gin... and I don&#39;t know... a few 
glasses of wine?&quot;

Blue eyes stared at her in shock. That much?! Why wasn&#39;t she getting her 
stomach pumped by now or dead?!

&quot;How?&quot;

The raven-haired woman raised her gaze to meet Serena&#39;s eyes. She smiled 
and almost sounded bitter when she spoke.

&quot;I&#39;m not dead because most assassins build up a high tolerance. Um... 
thanks for the tea.&quot;

Serena nodded. The uncomfortable silence engulfed them. Looking for 
something to do, the blonde began to fold Rei&#39;s clothes that she changed 
her out off last night. The assassin blushed, realizing what the hostage 
had done for her.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to, I&#39;ll-&quot;

Rei stood and the room began to spin. She sat down again quickly, trying 
to concentrate. Serena watched the scene unfold and smiled slightly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay. I got it.&quot;

After the younger woman&#39;s clothes were folded neatly, the blonde started 
to tidy up the room. She couldn&#39;t just stand there, anyhow. Too big a 
risk of looking into those intense violet eyes.

&quot;Serena...&quot;

The woman stopped at the sound of her name. Such a gentle voice. But 
that doesn&#39;t change facts. She&#39;ll just be Raven again in a few seconds.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for anything improper or rude I did when I was drunk.&quot;

Serena didn&#39;t know whether to feel happy or sad Rei didn&#39;t ask her why 
she didn&#39;t escape. She was mostly happy though, since she had no real 
answer for herself, much less anything she could offer the assassin.

&quot;You did nothing disrespectful.&quot;

&quot;Oh, good.&quot;

Silence again.

&quot;Let&#39;s just... forget last night ever happened.&quot;

The soft voice of Rei was gone and left in its place was the cold and 
uncaring voice of Raven. Serena felt her hope diminish. She didn&#39;t want 
to be right.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

Blue eyes looked at the woman on the bed. The fa&ccedil;ade melted for just a 
split second as Serena received the smallest of smiles. The blonde 
brightened and smiled back. Maybe she was learning.

~*~*~*~*~

The bright eyes watched the afternoon news on the tiny (and not to 
mention ancient) TV. There was an entire ten minutes dedicated to her 
disappearance. Her father even appeared, pleading for anyone who knew 
anything top come forward.

She cursed softly under her breath. The second time in two days. Her 
father was so fake, even to her. Everything was just for show, from her 
quivering lips to his grief-filled voice to his tears. Part of her 
screamed that he was being truthful. Yet she knew better. Her father 
didn&#39;t love her. Maybe he did once, but not anymore.

A groan from the bed next to her forced her attention away from the 
television.

The dark-haired assassin was sleeping, tucked under a mass of blankets. 
Though it wasn&#39;t at all cold, Rei claimed she was. Serena suspected the 
assassin just wanted to snuggle. A smile came to her lips at the 
thought.

It had taken a lot to get Rei to sleep. The woman insisted she stay 
awake since she wouldn&#39;t be able to sleep. The blonde, on the other 
hand, knew the woman felt as if she should stay up and watch her 
captive. It must be hard for Rei to deal with her hostage taking care of 
her.

Serena scolded herself. Why was she taking into consideration the 
woman&#39;s feelings? She should be rubbing it in her face.

Blue eyes gazed at the figure sleeping peacefully. Maybe it was her 
curiosity as to why the woman was an assassin. She seemed like the type 
to be able to accomplish anything she wanted to. Surely her dream wasn&#39;t 
to be a killer?

The blonde suddenly noticed a light bruise on the right side of the full 
lips. She walked over and knelt in front of the other&#39;s bed, a hand 
reaching out to tentatively brushed against the dark spot.

Her hand recoiled when Rei winced in her sleep. Where on Earth was that 
from? Did she get into a fight?

Just then, she remembered what seemed to be an eternity ago, though in 
reality only two days. She remembered how out of control she was after 
reading the newspaper. She remembered how Rei pushed her back onto the 
bed.

She was surprised at the other woman&#39;s strength. She shouldn&#39;t have 
been, but she was. She remembered how Rei straddled her, keeping her 
from moving too much. The assassin&#39;s long legs pinned her own down to 
the mattress forcefully. One slender hate suddenly filled with such 
strength pinned the blonde&#39;s hands over her head while the other clamped 
over her mouth.

She also remembered how she didn&#39;t calm down. Rei&#39;s hands moved from her 
mouth and delivered a world-jarring slap to her cheek.

It stung. It stung like hell! Damn it, she saw stars for god&#39;s sake. But 
it hadn&#39;t been hard enough to leave a bruise. Rei had been holding back.

But the blond refused to snap out of the frenzy she was in. Minako&#39;s 
reputation along with hers had been ruined by the actions of this woman. 
The woman altered their lives when she kidnapped her. And she just 
slapped her?

Serena remembered how the numbness and shock wore off. Then there was 
anger, frustration and hate. Damn it, she hated Rei. She wanted to rip 
the woman apart.

So when the assassin&#39;s hold on her wrists loosened, her right hand 
managed to slip from her grip. With all the strength she possessed, she 
punched Rei. Everything she felt all rolled into that one punch.

Rei&#39;s head snapped back. Serena&#39;s aim was far worse than she hoped. 
Hell, she also felt like her hand was about to break.

The adrenaline wore off just as quickly as it came. Then the fear 
settled in.

She just punched her kidnapper. She just punched Raven for fucking god&#39;s 
sake! What the hell was she thinking?

Rei slowly looked at her, lavender eyes dark. Her face was one that 
warned the blonde of danger. She was mad. She was VERY mad.

Without warning, the assassin jumped off. The hostage&#39;s heart pounded 
furiously and for a second, she thought Rei was going to severely hurt 
her.

Suddenly, she found herself pinned under the woman again. This time, she 
was far from gentle. Small but efficient hands placed cuffs on her feet 
and ropes around her wrists, tying to the bedposts. The blonde fought in 
vain and finally opened her mouth to scream. It was then, for the first 
time, she felt the coolness of metal pressed against her temple.

Serena froze, her blue eyes wide with fear. Rei&#39;s eyes narrowed 
dangerously, her voice deadly calm and low when she spoke.

&quot;Shut up. Don&#39;t make me use this.&quot;

Serena hushed immediately. She felt Rei shove a piece of clothe into her 
mouth.

&quot;Don&#39;t make me hurt you,&quot; the taller woman whispered heatedly.

Serena nodded as the woman got off and entered the bathroom, slamming 
the door shut behind her.

~*~*~*~

The short blonde sighed and massaged her temples. She remembered feeling 
real fear for the first time. Cold sweat formed on her brow and her 
heart rate was well above normal. Although her adrenaline was pumping 
through her veins and her body was ready for action, her mind shut down.

Serena had a gun pressed to her head. Rei&#39;s eyes were cold, though what 
lay under that calm and emotionless mask was anger. A raging fire, hot 
and dangerous. She had pushed the woman to such a level.

No matter what she did, Rei was always in control. She was never 
annoyed, exasperated yes, but annoyed never. But that night, the woman 
lost it. She saw the uncontrollable fire in her eyes and how the woman 
avoided eye contract the entire time.

Serena sighed and brushed a strand of hair from the assassin&#39;s face, 
returning the favor from the other morning. Rei made a promise she 
couldn&#39;t keep.

So why did she make it then? They both knew that everything was NOT 
going to be okay. She must have felt guilty about tying the blonde up. 
She heard it in her voice when the other woman spoke. Of course, Rei 
thought she was asleep. Why else would the assassin let her see the 
gentler side that existed?

So why was she still here?

Besides the obvious. Rei, even in such a weakened state, could probably 
hunt her down. Perhaps the hangover would slow her down, but not by 
much. In a short time, while the blonde wandered around looking for a 
phone, Rei would find her. Then she would probably kill her. If not 
death, then severe bodily harm.

Serena sighed again. But there was something else. She wanted to stay. 
Why?

Rei. She was such an enigma. And Serena was curious. Very much so.

The woman in the bed groaned again, causing the blonde to jumped back 
onto her own bed and pretend to be engrossed with the TV. The dark head 
rose from the pillow. Blankets fell from her shoulders and pooled around 
her lap. With a loud yawn, violet eyes scanned the room. When they 
landed on the blonde, ruby lips quirked up slightly in a smile.

&quot;Mornin&#39;.&quot;

Serena&#39;s lips curved up as well, but into a smirk. &quot;It&#39;s more like 
&#39;evening.&#39;&quot;

Rei groaned again and collapsed on the bed. The hostage was really 
enjoying this whole superiority thing. Well, since she didn&#39;t run and 
was helping her, the assassin would deal.

She hadn&#39;t been surprised to find the blonde was still here when she 
woke up the morning after. She knew she had cut the ropes. Hell, part of 
her even pushed back her training, the side that demanded she retie 
Serena. The newest addition to herself has never existed before that 
night, at least not that she knew of. Was she developing a damn 
conscience?

Raven locks flew everywhere as she shook her head. No, she couldn&#39;t be.

Back to the point. Rei knew the blonde wouldn&#39;t leave. She was too kind, 
too nice... too innocent to escape. Plus, she must have said something 
to make her stay. She just didn&#39;t remember what.

&quot;Are you feeling better?&quot;

&quot;Well, the room&#39;s not spinning anymore. I&#39;d say that&#39;s a huge plus.&quot;

Serena couldn&#39;t suppress her giggles. The assassin tried to glare at 
her, but failed miserably. At the look of mock anger on the woman&#39;s 
face, the blonde giggled harder.

The next thing she knew, something soft hit her youthful face. Blue eyes 
looked around, blinking in confusion. Finally, they landed on a pillow 
by her leg. She looked behind; hers was still there so that one was...

Serena glared at the assassin smiling innocently across from her. The 
blonde froze, watching the transformation of the woman from a cold 
hearted killer to a carefree girl.

Blue eyes narrowed as evil smirk appeared on the pink lips. Rei gulped 
softly, not looking that look.

&quot;Bonsai!&quot;

With that war cry, Serena pounced on Rei with the pillow that was just 
thrown at her.

&quot;Ack!&quot;

The raven-haired woman was being pummeled by the pillow-wielding girl 
relentlessly. Rei shrieked again and scrambled for the other bed. Serena 
realized this and held the pillow high over her head, ready to sock it 
to the assassin hard. Violet eyes saw the perfect opportunity and 
lightly shoved Serena on the stomach.

The blonde screamed as she lost her balance and fell of the bed. Rei 
darted over to the other bed, grabbed it and turned around.

As Serena&#39;s head poked back up from the floor, she was hit hard by a 
pillow. She opened her mouth to yell at the assassin when the other 
woman&#39;s shadow covered her. Blue eyes looked up and met the twinkling 
orbs of a smirking Rei. Serena laughed nervously but when she saw the 
serious expression on the taller woman&#39;s face, she stopped and sighed 
softly.

&quot;Let me guess, I&#39;m going to get pummeled?&quot;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&quot;Bring it on.&quot;

Without warning, the two girls began hitting each other with the 
feather-filled pillows...

A good fifteen minutes later, the two laid on their beds, completely 
exhausted. For the first time in years, Rei was out of breath. And to 
think, it wasn&#39;t because she was infiltrating some rival assassin guild 
headquarters, not because she was in a cage fight, not some 
assassination attempt but because of a simple pillow fight. She had 
never had so much fun, and she told the blonde so.

&quot;Never?&quot; Serena asked as she sat up, shocked.

Rei shook her head, feeling uncomfortable at the hostage&#39;s sympathetic 
gaze.

&quot;Not when you were younger? Minako and I do this at least once a month 
still!&quot;

The assassin stood, feeling embarrassed, if the blush on her cheeks was 
any indication.

&quot;I never had much of a childhood.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Why not?&quot;

Serena was prying and she knew it. But how can she resist such a chance? 
Maybe she&#39;d know why Rei was an assassin. That seemed to have become her 
goal.

&quot;Well,&quot; the violet-eyed woman began hesitantly. What was she supposed to 
say? The truth? Hell no. But as she looked at those sincere eyes, she 
just couldn&#39;t resist.

&quot;I was very young when my parents died.&quot;

Serena&#39;s mouth formed a tiny &quot;O&quot; as her hand moved to cover it. Blue 
eyes were filled with shock but understanding at the same time. After 
all, her own mother had passed away not that long ago.

Rei looked away. She didn&#39;t want pity. What possessed her to tell her 
that anyhow? Only three people knew that. And even worse, Serena was a 
hostage, a job. She must be losing it.

Slim arms wrapped around her stomach and pulled her into a warm body. 
Now it was her turn to be shocked as all her confusion faded. She only 
stood there, motionless and trying to grasp what was happening.

Serena knew the raven-haired girl would not respond. At least she 
understood now why Rei was an assassin. It hurt a lot to lose her mother 
five years ago. But she couldn&#39;t even imagine how it feels to be young 
and lose both parents. At least her own father was still alive. Never 
mind the state of their relationship but he was alive.

Rei pulled away, refusing to be pitied. No, she HATED that. She&#39;d rather 
die.

&quot;I didn&#39;t tell you to have you pity me. I don&#39;t want it and I certainly 
don&#39;t need it.&quot;

Serena shook her head. NO, it wasn&#39;t pity. Her hand hesitantly reached 
out towards the stiff woman. This was her kidnapper. But Rei was turning 
out to be a lot more complicated than she had thought... and hoped.

She felt Rei stiffen even further at her touch and smiled softly.

&quot;It&#39;s not pity.&quot;

Silence. The blonde sighed.

&quot;I know how it feels to lose a parent. I lost my mom when I was 18.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

Out of all the things Serena expected to hear, THAT was not it. Yes, it 
was in the news but why would Rei bring that up? She shook her head.

&quot;Why-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m an assassin; we do our research before we...&quot;

Okay, so the woman didn&#39;t understand her question exactly. But that 
didn&#39;t make the surge of anger Serena felt go away. So Rei thought she 
knew everything about her? Great.

&quot;What else do you know?&quot; Serena demanded bitterly. &quot;My birthday? Shoe 
size? Favorite food? Favorite color? Height?!

&quot;Five foot seven. White and pink. Favorite foods are ice cream and cake. 
Size 7 shoes. And you&#39;re birthday is June 30th.&quot;

Serena stood there, dumbfounded. Rei knew as much about her as Ami or 
Minako. But...

&quot;Go to sleep. We have a long day tomorrow.&quot;

The blonde wordlessly retrieved her pillow and climbed into bed, her 
back facing Rei. The assassin felt something stir within her, but 
suppressed it immediately. She lay down as well, pulling her blankets 
close to her.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

The voice was flat and hallow, causing the assassin to wince. Serena was 
so happy just a minute ago. Now she&#39;s not, and it was her fault.

&quot;Yeah?&quot;

&quot;What are you doing tomorrow?&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re getting out of this hell hole.&quot;

Silence again.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

The fear made Rei cringe. Serena had good reason to be afraid.

&quot;My place.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes softened at the thought of her safe little corner in the 
crazy world. One place where she could forget everything, including what 
she did for a living. There, she wasn&#39;t an assassin, but just a normal 
person. She could be herself and not some tough and cold hearted bitch.

But this would be the first time she&#39;s bringing a hostage there. Her 
home has always been a safe haven. A place to hide. So why the hell was 
she bringing something that represented her life so strongly there?

She didn&#39;t know. But her employer had told her something the night she 
got drunk.

~*~*~Flashback~*~*~

Rei walked out of the alley way and into the street. Just then, her cell 
rang. Picking it up, she didn&#39;t bother to see who was calling.

&quot;Raven here.&quot;

&quot;Ah, my dear Raven,&quot; a deep voice said on the other line. &quot;How is the 
little hostage?&quot;

&quot;Fine,&quot; she growled. The tall woman didn&#39;t like this guy at all. But 
hell, she only cares about the money not the employer.

&quot;Good. I hope you&#39;re getting along with her. You&#39;ll be keeping her for 
quite a while.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; she hissed. &quot;We agreed on a week. It&#39;s been over five days.&quot;

&quot;Plans have changed. You&#39;ll be keeping her for another good few weeks.&quot;

&quot;What the fuck?!&quot; Rei exclaimed, getting her a looks from the people on 
the street. She glared at them and kept her head down, hurrying. She had 
good reason to be pissed. She&#39;s never kept a hostage for more than a 
week, much less months.

&quot;I&#39;ll be giving you an additional $50 million. That&#39;s a total of $70 
million. I&#39;ll even throw in another $30 million if I decide not to have 
her killed. That&#39;s $100 million, Raven. Quite a good deal, wouldn&#39;t you 
say?&quot;

A hundred million dollars. She&#39;d never have to work again. No more 
killing, no more kidnapping. No more nothing.

&quot;Very well.&quot;

Rei hung up and closed her eyes. Killing Serena was the eventual fate. 
This guy wouldn&#39;t willingly dish out $100 million. But the blonde was so 
damn innocent. How would she pull that trigger?

Rei cursed. Where the hell was the nearest bar?&#39;

~*~*~*~*~*~*~

PLEASE FORGIVE ME! That was the weirdest chapter ever. Serena was weird. 
Rei was a hell of a lot more emotional than I&#39;d planned. Argh. And I 
just had the urge to make them both curse more. Oops.</pre>
