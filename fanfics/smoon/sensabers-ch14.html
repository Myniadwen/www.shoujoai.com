<h1>Senshi Sabers (part 14 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>The armored backpack on the military Bio-Boomer
exploded, the missiles within detonating to stagger
the creature. Makoto leap up on to it&#39;s back even as
the other three raced in to restrain it, her
gauntleted hands digging into morphing flesh. In a
moment she found the heart crystal and crushed it, the
beast stopping cold.

&quot;Well,&quot; Naru asked as she looked up at her partner,
the brown haired officer holding her hand gun at the
ready, &quot;what now?&quot;

Usagi studied the armored figures a moment then she
yelled, &quot;Senshi Sabers! Surrender, or you will be
fired on!&quot;

&quot;You have got to be kidding,&quot; Rei muttered, her red
armor gleaming.

&quot;Fire,&quot; Usagi ordered and the assembled AD Police
officers opened fire!

Remarkably the bullets left the four armored figures
unfazed, though they did look irritated. The red
Senshi raised her cannon arm and fired into a nearby
squad car, the vehicle detonating in a burst of fire
and light. Blinded by the blast the AD Police officers
reeled back, the Senshi Sabers using the moment to
escape.

&quot;Well that&#39;s gratitude for you,&quot; Minako growled, the
golden armored figure bounding with the others from
roof to roof.

&quot;Remind me to be especially snarky to Usagi next time
I see her,&quot; Rei growled as they reached the Silky Doll
van, climbing in quickly.

&quot;That might be a big hint to her that you&#39;re a
Senshi,&quot; Ami said mildly.

&quot;Besides, she&#39;s just doing her job,&quot; Makoto pointed
out, pulling her green helm off and shaking out her
hair.

Minako shook her head, blonde hair flowing as she
efficiently stripped off armor, &quot;You&#39;re more generous
than I am.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;d better move before the Police get mobilized,&quot;
Ami said, changing into a simple if stylish looking
jumpsuit. She climbed up into the front seat and then
started up the van, pulling out into traffic and
heading back to the Silky Doll.

Rei changed into her clothes ad headed up, climbing
into the passenger seat. &quot;What are you going to do
about Infinity?&quot; she asked.

Ami raised an eyebrow at her, keeping her gaze on the
road. &quot;I thought we already discussed this?&quot; she
inquired.

&quot;Not really,&quot; Rei said dryly. She studied the blue
haired woman intently then she pressed, &quot;Do you trust
Ms. Tomoe?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Ami conceded. &quot;She clearly is
ruthless, as well as being capable of killing,&quot; she
said, &quot;but she appeared to be frank with me.&quot;

&quot;Huh,&quot; Rei sat back, her black hair flowing loose. She
smiled faintly, &quot;And what does your gut tell you?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t listen to my gut,&quot; Ami said with a faintly
amused smile, &quot;or however you may choose to describe
your instincts.&quot;

&quot;You should try it,&quot; Rei said, &quot;listening to my gut
was how I made the decision to join the Senshi in the
first place.&quot;

&quot;Then I like your gut,&quot; Ami admitted as Rei chuckled
softly.

In the back of the van Minako slipped her leather
miniskirt on, feeling Makoto&#39;s eyes resting on her as
she put a bit of extra wiggle into pulling on the
tight garment. &quot;Rei sure was fast going up to join
Ami,&quot; she noted with a grin.

Makoto slipped her own somewhat looser dress on,
balancing carefully to the sway of the van. &quot;What are
you thinking of?&quot; she asked, a smile on her face.

&quot;Do you think that Rei likes her?&quot; Minako asked
curiously.

&quot;Considering how much they argue,&quot; Makoto sat down on
a bench to slip her socks and shoes on, &quot;I kind of
doubt it.&quot;

Minako looked thoughtful as she pointed out, &quot;Maybe
so, but have you noticed they can&#39;t keep their eyes
off each other?&quot;

That actually made Makoto stop a second, recalling the
two of them together. &quot;You know,&quot; she conceded, &quot;you
might have a point about that.&quot;

&quot;Now, what should we do about it?&quot; Minako asked
eagerly.

&quot;Should we do anything?&quot; Makoto raised an eyebrow.
Seeing her lover&#39;s disappointed look she smiled
gently, &quot;I think both of them wouldn&#39;t react well to
our meddling.&quot;

Minako paled, thinking of the last time she had
managed to annoy Ami, and the tongue lashing she got
for it. Not to mention the kind of temper Rei seemed
to have, too. &quot;You might have a point, too,&quot; she
conceded.

&quot;You know I do,&quot; Makoto grinned. They could feel the
truck jerking to a stop and she smiled, &quot;Looks like
we&#39;re back.&quot;

In a moment they were all out, the underground
facilities that the Senshi Sabers used stretching out
all around them. Ami climbed out of the driver&#39;s seat
as she said, &quot;Your standard wages will be
electronically deposited within the hour.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Rei said mildly, &quot;I need to pay the parking
fees for my trailer.&quot;

&quot;Why do you live in that thing, anyway?&quot; Ami asked
curiously, &quot;I had a detective do a check on you, you
could easily afford better.&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Rei blinked, a bit of edge to her voice.

&quot;Much like I did with our fellow Senshi,&quot; Ami kept her
voice even.

&quot;I don&#39;t really give a shit if you did it to everyone
else,&quot; Rei flared up, &quot;stay the hell out of my private
life!&quot; With that she turned and strode away, leaving
them in stunned silence.

&quot;You were saying?&quot; Makoto murmured to Minako.

&quot;Hush,&quot; Minako hissed. She looked to Ami, noting the
oddly bemused look on her face as she asked, &quot;What was
that all about?&quot;

In a soft voice Ami said almost to herself, &quot;I think
I&#39;m beginning to figure it out.&quot; Shaking herself she
looked at the other two, &quot;Excuse me, I was planning to
work on the hardsuits tonight.&quot; And with that she was
off.

&quot;You know, I don&#39;t think I understand either of them,&quot;
Makoto said as she and Minako headed out to the street
level.

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Minako sighed. She smiled, cuddling close
to Makoto as she murmured, &quot;You busy tonight?&quot;

Makoto slid a arm over Minako&#39;s shoulders, &quot;Oh, I was
thinking of taking a lovely blonde to dinner... any
volunteers?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Minako sighed happily.

Striding through the base to the engineering bay Ami
was lost in her thoughts. &#39;Rei and I are alike,&#39; she
realized, &#39;someone gets close, like with our
conversation in the van, we then have to shove them
away.&#39;

&quot;Ms. Mizuno,&quot; Mercury&#39;s soft voice said, &quot;there are
two messages waiting for you, both marked as urgent.&quot;

&quot;Thank you Mercury,&quot; Ami said even as she silently
cursed her momentary distraction. &quot;Play all,&quot; she
ordered.

&quot;This is Setsuna,&quot; the familiar voice said, &quot;I&#39;ve
found some disturbing information interviewing a
former Infinity employee. Apparently there&#39;s a
prototype for Saturn out there called &#39;Nine,&#39; a
failure. I&#39;ll keep looking into it.&quot;

&quot;Nine?&quot; Ami blinked, her eyes narrowing. &#39;That
Bio-boomer said something about Mistress Nine,&#39; she
remembered.

&quot;Ms. Mizuno,&quot; Hotaru Tomoe&#39;s voice came on next,
&quot;please contact me in person as soon as possible on a
matter of gravest importance.&quot;

&#39;In person?&#39; Ami blinked, wondering what could be so
urgent. &#39;Guess I&#39;ll find out soon enough,&#39; she thought
as she ordered, &quot;Mercury, query the Infinity computers
as to Hotaru&#39;s current location.&quot;

&quot;Infinity Tower,&quot; Mercury responded promptly, &quot;she
just arrived back.&quot;

&quot;Call and let her know I&#39;m on my way,&quot; Ami added.</pre>
