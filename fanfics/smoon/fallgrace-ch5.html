<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Rei snuggled deeper into her covers.

&quot;Come on, Rei, wake up.&quot;

The miko groaned and lazily opened one eye. Spotting her guest, she 
opened the other.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;I have something to show you.&quot;

Rei groaned again and pulled the covers over her head.

&quot;Go away, I&#39;m sick.&quot;

&quot;Funny,&quot; Hotaru snorted, &quot;that&#39;s not what you told me yesterday.&quot;

Another groan. The college student smiled softly and shook the bundle.

&quot;Come on.&quot;

The miko growled in frustration as she sat up, half-closed eyes glaring 
at the disturber of her sleep, the intruder of her peace, the interloper 
of her silent conversation with Morpheus, the- why was she completely 
unfazed by the promise of death on her face.

&quot;What time is it?&quot;

&quot;Five forty-eight.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hell. You&#39;re kidding me,&quot; Rei moaned, collapsing on the bed again.

&quot;No, I&#39;m not. Now up!&quot;

No movement what so ever. Hotaru mumbled something before ripping off 
the covers. Rei simply rolled onto her stomach.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

An incoherent mumble was her response. Hotaru sighed and sat down on the 
bed.

&quot;Try that again? In a language I can understand this time.&quot;

Rei picked her head up and glared.

&quot;I said, &#39;why do you want me up so early?&#39;&quot;

&quot;Oh. Well, to watch the sunrise with me.&quot;

&quot;To watch the sunrise with you.&quot;

All Hotaru did was nod. At that point, Rei buried her face into her 
pillow. Hotaru sighed and got off the bed, ready to leave when Rei 
suddenly popped into a sitting position and threw herself out of bed. 
The college student blinked, eyeing the annoyed expression on Rei&#39;s 
face.

&quot;Well? Come on, I&#39;m up. Let&#39;s go watch your sunrise.&quot;

Hotaru followed quickly, racing out of the room. The miko was sitting on 
the balcony that opened up to the living room, mumbling about something 
or other. Just as she started to wonder where exactly was the cause of 
the early start to her day, Hotaru sat down beside her and draped a 
blanket over them both.

&quot;It&#39;s chilly out. And you&#39;re sick.&quot;

Rei opened her mouth to protest when their conversation in her bedroom 
resurfaced. Instead, she glared at the cocky girl.

&quot;Haha, very funny.&quot;

Hotaru wrinkled her nose and smiled. &quot;Glad you think so.&quot;

&quot;You...&quot;

The younger girl opened her mouth to comment about the lack of a proper 
retort, but decided against it. After all, Rei was nice enough to watch 
the sunrise with her.

Rei was about to comment about the lack of a retort to her lack of a 
retort when it began.

&quot;I forgot how beautiful sunrise is.&quot;

Hotaru looked at Rei for a second before turning her attention back on 
the spectacular scene unfolding before her. There were no words to 
describe it. Even a picture couldn&#39;t capture its true beauty.

&quot;Yes, well, with your... activities... it&#39;s hard.&quot;

Hotaru ignored the hesitation she sensed from Rei when she mentioned her 
&quot;activities.&quot; She also ignored the dark look in the miko&#39;s eyes. Don&#39;t 
do it if you can&#39;t talk about it.

&quot;I know.&quot;

Rei sighed and looked away from the sunrise to Hotaru.

&quot;Everyone knows.&quot;

&quot;Well, in such a tight group of people, it&#39;s hard not to.&quot;

&quot;Hm... but none of them say anything.&quot;

&quot;Well, we figured you&#39;ll talk about it when you want to. The last thing 
we want to do is push someone like you.&quot;

&quot;Someone like me? What&#39;s that supposed to mean.&quot;

Hotaru shot Rei a look but then returned her attention to the sunrise. 
&quot;With your temper, we expect you to blow up in our faces.&quot;

Rei quieted immediately. The girl had a point.

&quot;What does everyone think about it?&quot;

&quot;We all have different opinions.&quot;

The miko arched a brow. Were they going to play the game they played 
last night?

&quot;Like what?&quot;

Hotaru paused, looking thoughtful. Rei waited, patient for the first 
time in her life.

&quot;Well, Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa are both very worried. But, they 
figure it&#39;s your life and you know what you&#39;re doing. Ami&#39;s worried 
about your health, she also doesn&#39;t approve, to be honest. Setsuna-mama, 
she&#39;s worried but not overly so, since she knows the future and all. 
Minako is kind of like Papa and Michi-mama. But she probably got the 
future events out of Setsuna-mama. Makoto&#39;s ready to kick your ass into 
stopping. And Usagi? All out worry and trying to get you to stop. 
Thankfully not as violently as Makoto though. Or else you&#39;d have 
everyone breathing down your neck since at her word, the concern will 
result in force.&quot;

Rei nodded. They cared about her so much, but that she knew already. And 
she already figured Makoto wanted to beat her into submission- not the 
kinky kind of submission.

&quot;And how do you know this? Do you guys talk about it?&quot;

&quot;No, but I can tell.&quot;

The miko nodded again. &quot;What do you think?&quot;

Silence. Rei&#39;s heart dropped. Sometimes, Hotaru was just as traditional 
as Ami, though she obviously had no problem with a woman sleeping with 
another woman. Sleeping with many of them, however, was a different 
story.

&quot;It&#39;s your life,&quot; Hotaru said finally. &quot;But I hope you&#39;ll stop. It kind 
of hurts that you feel like you can&#39;t come to us for help and have to 
turn to that. I mean, we&#39;re all family.&quot;

Rei could barely keep the tears from falling. She was hurting all of 
them, and not just herself. Was she stupid or just selfish for not 
seeing it before?

&quot;We all care about you, love you.&quot;

Hotaru turned to Rei and smiled softly. The miko looked away, trying to 
hide her tears.

&quot;Even me, if you can believe it.&quot;

The older senshi smiled, nodding while silently thanking her friend for 
ending the conversation.

&quot;So,&quot; Hotaru started, &quot;what should we eat for breakfast?&quot;

Rei looked at the sunrise for a brief moment. &quot;Why don&#39;t I make you my 
famous omelets?&quot;

To her amusement, Hotaru&#39;s eyes lit up with excitement. She hadn&#39;t had 
one of Rei&#39;s famous omelets in ages! What with Rei&#39;s never staying late 
in the morning during sleepovers and all. That and the fact that their 
lives were just all so busy now.

&quot;Great. Let&#39;s go now, I&#39;m starving.&quot;

Hotaru rolled her eyes at Rei&#39;s comment. Sometimes, she was as bad as 
Minako and Usagi. Either way, she followed the miko back into the 
apartment.

&quot;Hm... oh god, I forgot how good this was.&quot;

Rei smirked smugly. &quot;Of course it&#39;s good, I-&quot;

&quot;-made it, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know the drill.&quot;

The sight of the very fragile looking senshi inhaling any kind of food 
at high speeds was enough to make Rei smile. Hotaru paused in her 
devouring of the omelets once in a while to stuff some rice into her 
mouth.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you eating?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m not that hungry.&quot;

Hotaru blinked, and then frowned. &quot;But you said you were hungry a while 
ago.&quot;

Rei debated whether to be nice or mean. Looking at the confused 
expression on Hotaru&#39;s face, she didn&#39;t have the heart to tease.

&quot;I just wanted to see you eat, you know, without having to use force.&quot;

Hotaru blushed; who knew the miko could be so sweet?

&quot;But then again, anyone would lose their appetite if they saw you eating 
like you&#39;ve been starved for centuries.&quot;

All right, so she did have the heart to tease. But it was fun!

&quot;Hey!&quot; Hotaru exclaimed. &#39;I should have known &#39;sweet&#39; wouldn&#39;t last for 
long when it comes to Rei Hino.&#39;

&quot;So, what do you want to do today?&quot;

Violet eyes looked up with a protective gleam. &quot;You&#39;re still sick.&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes at the comment. &quot;With my healing abilities as well 
as the healing powers you&#39;ve been using on me, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m sick 
anymore.&quot;

Hotaru felt a piece of omelets go down the wrong pipe. Without warning, 
she began coughing like crazy. Rei reached over and patted her back 
while handing her some water. The liquid was gone within seconds.

&quot;You okay?&quot;

Hotaru noted the concern in Rei&#39;s voice and nodded. She looked at her 
meekly.

&quot;You knew?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Rei mumbled indignantly. &quot;I am a miko. I should be able to 
feel energy other than my own in my body.&quot;

&quot;I hoped you were too out of it from the concussion to realize.&quot;

&quot;Why would you do that?&quot;

Hotaru blushed. &quot;Well, you don&#39;t like getting help from others and I 
figured you&#39;d be annoyed if you found out.&quot;

The miko smiled softly and ran her fingers through Hotaru&#39;s hair.

&quot;You know, I am stubborn but I do like it if someone helps me cut down 
the time that I feel like shit. I won&#39;t act like it, yeah, but I still 
appreciate it.

Hotaru&#39;s blush darkened. &quot;That would make sense.&quot;

Rei laughed, surprising the college student. The color on her cheeks 
darkened, if possible.

&quot;I&#39;m not that stubborn.&quot;

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t start.&quot;

Hotaru smiled and nodded. She felt Rei place a hand over her own.

&quot;Now, finish eating before the omelets gets cold.&quot;

Since Rei cooked, Hotaru insisted that she do the dishes. Rei, however, 
knew it was because the girl thought she was still sick. Oh well, no 
dishes for her to do.

&quot;What do you want to do today?&quot;

&quot;Hm... I don&#39;t know. I suspect Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama are coming 
home tonight.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Rei tried not to sound disappointed, but failed. Hotaru looked at the 
woman in the doorway. Somehow, Rei looked pretty lonely. Whoever thought 
the powerful miko would look so down?

&quot;But,&quot; Hotaru started, &quot;I don&#39;t have school after tomorrow and I only 
have three finals and a paper to hand in. I&#39;ve studied for the finals 
more than enough. Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama could probably use some 
more time alone.&quot;

The miko&#39;s expression brightened as she practically beamed at her 
friend. She opened her mouth to speak, but was cut off by the phone 
ringing.

Hotaru watched as Rei ran off to get the phone. She came on Friday 
night, dreading the time she&#39;d spend here. Well, half-dreading. After 
all, who wouldn&#39;t want to stay at their love&#39;s house?

Since then, they&#39;ve already hit four awkward moments, interrupted Makoto 
and Ami as well as discussed an off-limits topic for each of them. All 
within 32 hours. Not a great track record considering Rei was 
unconscious for about... 20 of those hours.

And her fear&#39;s come true.

She was falling deeper for Rei Hino.

The woman could make her feel special. She called her beautiful! The 
less rational side of her mind decided this meant Rei liked her in 
return. She also bickered with the miko constantly, though it was their 
way of conversing and it was definitely fun. Rei&#39;s also been nice, 
cooking her breakfast and all. The miko even woke up at an ungodly hour 
to watch the sunrise with her. Not to mention let her drink, something 
that Michiru and Haruka never let her do. After the confession, there 
was no running for the hills or disgust. And she was forgiven by the hot 
tempered woman for touching on the most delicate subject of them all.

Damn, falling deeper in love every second.

&quot;Hey, Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Hotaru mumbled as Rei reappeared in the kitchen.

&quot;Looks like you don&#39;t have a choice in the matter.&quot;

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;Ruka and Michiru decided to stay for another week or so. And your keys 
are in Haruka&#39;s car.&quot;

Hotaru blinked. Oh, how convenient. The keys that were in her coat 
pocket Saturday afternoon were in Haruka-papa&#39;s car when the last time 
she rode in it was a week ago. Uh-huh, they were so dead when got her 
hands on them.

&quot;Oh, I guess I&#39;m staying for a while. Is that okay with you?&quot;

Rei nodded, trying not to break her face by grinning. &quot;Of course. Have 
you finished your report?&quot;

&quot;Shit! That&#39;s what I forgot!&quot;

Hotaru groaned and dried the dishes quickly.

&quot;How much more do you have to write?&quot;

&quot;Only five pages or so.&quot;

A fine brow arched in question. &quot;Only five?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. My whole paper&#39;s 38 pages.&quot;

Rei stifled a cough. Thirty-eight pages! She was almost as bad as Ami! 
God, genius, go figure.

&quot;You can use my computer. I&#39;ll finish the,&quot; Rei looked at the empty 
sink, &quot;already done dishes.&quot;

Hotaru grinned and unconsciously hugged Rei. The miko blinked, feeling 
the slender arms wrapped around her body. When was the last time she and 
the college student hugged each other?

&quot;Oh my god, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Hotaru gasped as she pulled away.

&quot;Huh?&quot; Rei asked, dazed. &quot;It&#39;s perfectly all right. I can&#39;t remember the 
last time you did that.&quot;

Hotaru blushed at the soft smile on the miko&#39;s face. &quot;Um... I&#39;m going to 
do that report now.&quot;

At lightning speed, the girl disappeared into the study, leaving one 
confused miko in her wake.

Rei watched as small hands gathered the papers from the printer. 
Carefully, they made sure all the sides were even before stapling the 
sheets together.

&quot;Thirty-eight pages, huh?&quot;

Violet eyes glared at the miko slightly before flipping through the 
pages of her report.

&quot;Well, it&#39;s only a few pages longer than I thought.&quot;

&quot;Seven to be exact.&quot;

&quot;All right, it&#39;s a lot over.&quot;

Hotaru pointedly ignored Rei as the woman approached. She felt a hand 
force her to turn around to meet a pair of amused but apologetic eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m only teasing. It&#39;s good.&quot;

And was Rei telling the truth. True, she wasn&#39;t as qualified to judge 
papers or as smart as Ami was, but she hadn&#39;t been a bad student in her 
time either.

- Flashback -

After half an hour, Rei peaked into her study to find her friend typing 
away furiously. The books from the other day surrounded the desk, 
accompanied by piles of papers.

Another half hour later, it was pretty much the same sight that greeted 
her.

She checked up on Hotaru three more times at half hour intervals. Each 
time she found Hotaru hard at work. Finally, the fourth time, she was 
surprised to see the typing had stopped. But the writer&#39;s eyes were 
still glued on the screen.

&quot;Don&#39;t stare.&quot;

The comment caused the engrossed student to jump. Rei smiled.

&quot;What did you say?&quot;

&quot;I said,&quot; the miko repeated as she approached the desk, &quot;&#39;don&#39;t stare.&#39; 
It&#39;s bad for your eyes.&quot;

Hotaru stretched and suppressed a yawn. &quot;I know. But I have to proofread 
this.&quot;

Rei pulled Hotaru out of the chair, despite the violent protests. She 
held up a hand, silencing the stressed student.

&quot;I&#39;ll proofread it. You haven&#39;t moved in three hours. Go get something 
to drink and freshen yourself up.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

A smile of gratitude was returned by a grin.

&quot;Now, go.&quot;

When Hotaru returned fifteen minutes later, sipping a Coke, she found 
Rei engrossed in her report. To call her nervous was severely 
understating her anxiety. She was a complete wreck. It&#39;s not every day 
your secret love reads your paper.

&quot;Wow,&quot; was all Rei said after she finished. &quot;It&#39;s very good. As good as 
Ami&#39;s I&#39;d say.&quot;

Hotaru blushed, playing with the paperclips on the desk.

&quot;You&#39;re exaggerating.&quot;

&quot;No, really.&quot;

&quot;If you say so, Rei...&quot;

- End -

And now, Hotaru was playing with the cover of her report while the miko 
laughed at her anxiety inwardly.

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. And your teacher will love it.&quot;

Hotaru couldn&#39;t help but smile, though somewhat weakly.

&quot;And if she doesn&#39;t,&quot; Rei continued, &quot;Haruka and I will mess up her 
car.&quot;

&quot;Rei!&quot; Hotaru scolded, though she was unable to prevent herself from 
giggling.

&quot;All right. We&#39;ll only slash her tires.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re impossible.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

The statement earned the miko a slap on the arm. A smile blossomed on 
the beautiful features as bright eyes focused on the young woman.

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart quickened when she saw the appreciative smile. Damn, why she 
didn&#39;t notice how beautiful Hotaru was before? She forced herself not to 
dwell on the thought and crossed her arms while looking at her guest.

&quot;So, what now?&quot;

&quot;No idea,&quot; Hotaru answered, putting her paper away in her book bag.

&quot;Is there anything in the fridge?&quot;

&quot;No, not really. I think you used everything for the omelets.&quot;

&quot;Come on, then.&quot;

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

The miko turned, eyes twinkling with mischief.

&quot;Grocery shopping.&quot;

If anyone ever told her she&#39;d be pushing a cart in a supermarket on a 
Sunday afternoon while Rei Hino dumped things in like a child, Hotaru 
Tomoe would have thought they were in serious need of psychiatric help.

But sure enough, there she was.

&quot;Rei! That&#39;s not healthy!&quot;

&quot;So? It&#39;s good.&quot;

&quot;Ugh, Minako and Usagi have rubbed off on you.&quot;

All Hotaru got in response was a grin, causing her to abandon the idea 
of Rei and healthy.

&quot;Let&#39;s go to the fruit section. That ought to please you.&quot;

Hotaru groaned as Rei disappeared behind the isles. Pushing the full 
cart along with some difficulty, the college student took her time.

The sight that met her when she found Rei caused her to stop.

Since she was sick, Hotaru made Rei wear a jacket over her black blouse, 
despite being almost summer. There she stood, holding a melon to her 
nose, sniffing like a cute little bunny rabbit. With a frown, the miko 
picked up another while her hair caught the light, framing her in a sea 
of dark lavender.

Upon realizing that she was admiring her friend pick out fruits, Hotaru 
gave a soft groan and slammed her head repeatedly on the handle of the 
cart. She was doomed.

&quot;Hotaru? Are you okay? What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

Black locks went flying everywhere as her head snapped up. Damn, Rei 
even looked cute gazing at her in confusion, her lips forming a slight 
pout, her head tilted to-

&quot;Huh? Oh, nothing.&quot;

&#39;I am even more screwed than I thought.&#39;

&quot;Are you sure?&quot;

&quot;Um... I just remembered that I have to pick up some film for my 
camera.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Rei said pausing, &quot;there&#39;s a photo store next door. Why don&#39;t you 
get it while I pay for the groceries?&quot;

Hotaru felt Rei move to her side and push the cart towards the check out 
counters.

&quot;You sure? I mean, I don&#39;t really need it.&quot;

The miko waved dismissively as they began unloading the cart onto the 
counter. The elderly woman began ringing up the groceries as Hotaru 
gazed at her companion hesitantly.

&quot;Yes, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

&quot;But... you still have a slight temperature.&quot;

&quot;Hotaru!&quot; Rei growled in pure annoyance while rolling her eyes. &quot;A 
slight temperature will NOT cause me to forget how to pay for food.&quot;

&quot;All right. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

Hotaru rushed out of the store, causing Rei to smile and shake her head 
slightly.

&quot;That will be fifty-one forty, please.&quot;

The miko took out the money from the pocket of her jeans and handed the 
woman some money.

&quot;Is she your girlfriend?&quot;

Lavender eyes stared at the cashier with the kind smile in pure shock. 
Her lips were parted as she openly gawked.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; she managed to croak, but just barely.

&quot;The girl that just ran out, your girlfriend?&quot;

Rei barely grasped the question. Hotaru. Her. Girlfriend. She realized 
seconds later the woman was still waiting for the rest of the bills in 
her hand.

&quot;Um... no. She&#39;s just a friend.&quot;

The woman gave her the change and a warm smile.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry, dear. You two make a cute couple, that&#39;s all.&quot;

The miko nodded numbly and grabbed the groceries. She headed for the 
photo shop just next door, spotting Hotaru through the glass.

The girl was leaning against the counter, looking a bit annoyed. Her 
violet eyes browsed the small shop, pausing for a few seconds on the 
many photos on all sides. The gray sweater hugged her form, revealing 
curves Rei never noticed before. Her arm supported her head, while a 
foot tapped the floor with the tip of her shoe.

She looked so innocent, her pink lips pursued, hair getting in the way. 
So perfectly undisturbed.

The man soon returned and handed Hotaru a small box, for which she paid 
quickly. It was when she turned around that she discovered that Rei was 
staring at her.

&quot;Done?&quot; she asked softly, taking two bags from the miko.

&quot;Yup.&quot;

Hotaru nodded as the two walked down the street, side by side. They 
remained silent, enjoying the natural and comfortable quiet. But it was 
impossible to relax completely, since the scenes they saw today refused 
to leave their minds.</pre>
