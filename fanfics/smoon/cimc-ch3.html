Many of the Undead had been viciously slaughtered already, and the girl 
frowned as she saw the carnage...

...But she had an idea....the &quot;Beast&quot; had since left her alone, to do her 
own bidding...

She frowned...there had to be a way to unite ALL of the vampires...

She smiled...she would find a way...

...in die illa tremenda
quando coeli movendi sunt et terra...

...on that awful day
when the heavens and earth shall be shaken...

Minako was following her again. It was odd...she was beginning to wonder 
if she had a bit of a fixation with the girl.  Of course not, she 
thought, running her fingers through her blonde hair, she&#146;s just cute! I 
don&#146;t obsess over people...well there was that...those three...no...six 
times...why is she so happy? She noticed that the young lady seemed 
particularly happy today, with a slight spring in her step. That spring 
did quite...wonderful things to her backside...Minako rose her eyes back up 
to the girl. No time for that, she scolded herself, picking up her pace. 
The girl was whistling too...it was a little unnerving...what was she so 
excited about? Minako decided she&#146;d find out...
 
====================

As soon as Mitsuki got into her apartment, she made a beeline for the 
phone. Minako hid carefully and quietly, listening to the conversation.
 
&quot;He&#146;s so cute!&quot; Mitsuki practically squealed. &quot;And it&#146;ll be great to 
have him around, you know, to protect me...I&#146;ve been hearing stuff...&quot;
 
Minako caught a mumble over the phone, and Mitsuki gave an indignant 
squawk.
 
&quot;I am NOT paranoid, Ririko! I just...you know...I get lonely...and it&#146;s spooky 
nowadays, with all these freaks out...the police are saying they&#146;re 
&quot;modern-day vampires,&quot; and they just found another body...you know, that 
lady who owns that chain of restaurants? Yeah, her, Makoto Kino...&quot;
 
Minako clenched her fist and bit back a snarl. Lonely, huh? Let&#146;s see 
how her little &#145;boyfriend&#146; reacts when I tear through his throat...wait...am 
I jealous? She frowned and continued to listen.
 
&quot;Yeah..I know you liked her food, Ririko. Great loss...too bad...she was 
real young too. But no vamps will get me,&quot; she giggled again, &quot;I&#146;ll be 
fine. You take care of yourself, ne?&quot; She sighed. &quot;Yes, I will try to 
get my hours shortened...but you know Kazuki...I&#146;ll have to, with him 
around...can&#146;t leave him all alone in here. I&#146;ll catch you later..bai!&quot;
 
Minako was trying very hard to ignore the growing anger inside of her. 
It wasn&#146;t fair! I should have tainted her while I had the chance! 
Hmph...I&#146;ll just get her boyfriend...and a few others...She smirked, and 
turned into mist again, exiting the apartment.
 
And I&#146;ll be the one to comfort her when she&#146;s lonely...
 
====================
 
She was alive.
 
That was really weird, considering she was in a morgue, on a cold table.
 
She wasn&#146;t shivering, which was even odder, considering it was freezing 
in the room, and she was naked.
 
And she wasn&#146;t dead, which was still the most fascinating thing.
 
She remembered those two women, how the little one had bit her, and the 
whole world went black.
 
And now she was in a morgue.
 
If it hadn&#146;t been so frightening, she would have laughed out loud.
 
Instead, she called for help.
 
&quot;Help! Excuse me, but what am I doing here?!&quot;
 
&quot;Help me! It&#146;s me, the restaurant owner, Makoto Kino!&quot;
 
=====================
 
Ami Mizuno was used to hearing noises. It really didn&#146;t bother her 
anymore. She didn&#146;t believe in ghosts, and dead bodies were her 
specialty.
 
However, when she heard the corpse of Makoto Kino screaming from within 
the morgue, her blood went cold.
 
At first she thought she was going insane, and then she realized that 
the voice she was hearing was real.
 
Ami Mizuno may have been cautious, but she was not a coward, and she had 
an endless amount of curiosity.
 
When she opened that morgue door though, she was pretty sure she would 
regret doing it for the rest of her life....
 
=====================
 
The woman was absolutely beautiful. Pale, almost snow-white skin, bright 
blue eyes, and blond hair in two very long ponytails. She was wearing 
black from head to toe. Black flare jeans, a black, long-sleeved shirt, 
black boots...with killer heels, and finally a black trench coat to 
complete the ensemble. The only thing that wasn&#146;t black was the silver, 
crescent moon shaped earrings with a matching necklace. What stood out 
especially though was a rose tattoo, right above her collarbone. The red 
of the rose was more blood red than rose red, however. Not many people 
took notice of her, however, as most people in crowded cities do not pay 
attention to each other. She saw a particularly desperate looking man, 
and crooked her finger toward him. He practically ran to her, and she 
smirked, walking at the same, slow confident gait she had been.
 
When she finally got him alone, in that alley, she grabbed him, and 
plunged her teeth into his neck, feeding heavily.
 
When she was done with her meal, she disposed of the body. Her mother 
had always told her to clean up after she was finished eating.
 
She licked her lips, and frowned at the aftertaste. The blood wasn&#146;t the 
best she had ever had, but it would do until she went to talk to the 
detective.
 
Briefly wondering how the human race had become so foolish, she shrugged 
her shoulders and walked out of the alley. She felt a twinge of guilt, 
as always...but it wasn&#146;t so bad. It really wasn&#146;t her fault if he was 
just some dirty man...he probably didn&#146;t deserve to live anyway. She 
nodded her head. That was exactly right. Fools die quickly, after all....
 
====================
 
Minako really wished she could get drunk. How many had she killed...she 
felt sick. Too much blood, her leader would say. She really had taken 
too many victims. Three at least, a more than a couple of stray cats and 
dogs. The rage she had felt earlier had dimmed to a dull pain. But she 
really couldn&#146;t figure out why she was so angry. Because of that girl? A 
girl who&#146;s name she did not even know had a love interest. Big deal.
 
Then why, she wondered, did she feel so horrible?
 
====================
 
I&#146;m so sleepy, Rei thought, yawning and stretching her arms. She heard a 
tap on her door and Yuuchirou poked his head in. &quot;Um...Detective...someone&#146;s 
here to see you. Should I let her in? She&#146;s says she knows some stuff 
about these murders...&quot; he ducked as Rei threw a paperweight at him. &quot;Of 
course, let her in! You baka...&quot; Yuuchiru blanched. &quot;Ye...Yes ma&#146;am...&quot; 
 
A few seconds later, the woman walked in, and Rei felt her stomach drop. 
She was so beautiful, it was almost eerie...pale skin, slightly tinged 
with pink, luminous sapphire eyes...long blond hair...when she spoke, Rei 
had to lean forward in her chair to hear her.

&quot;I think...that I might be able to help you Detective Hino...I am Tsukino 
Usagi...&quot;
