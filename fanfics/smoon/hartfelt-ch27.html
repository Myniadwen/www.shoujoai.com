<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 27 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch26.html">Back to Part 26</a><p><u>(Rei)</u></p><p>The next morning, Rei awoke to the sound of an insistent knocking at 
her door. It was still dark outside, so she hadn’t slept in to her knowledge.</p><p><i>Who 
could it be at this time of the day?</i> She grumbled as she got up from her bed and 
stumbled over to the door. When she opened it, she saw blue eyes and instinctively jumped 
back in shock.</p><p>Usagi giggled. “Good Morning! Did I scare you?”</p><p>Rei slowly 
relaxed when she realized who it was. “Uhh... No! Of course not! Don’t be ridiculous! But 
for a second there, I thought you were someone else...” She 
mumbled.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Never mind. Anyway, what are you doing up so early? Did 
everything go well with Hotaru?”</p><p>“Yes!” Usagi beamed. “And it’s all thanks to 
you!”</p><p>“Ahh...well, I didn’t actually do anything...”</p><p>“Don’t be silly! I wouldn’t 
have gotten the courage to talk to her if it weren’t for you. Oh! And guess what? I have a 
surpriiiiise you for.”</p><p>Rei watched as the blonde begin to rummage for something in her 
dress. “What?” She asked suspiciously.</p><p>“Take a look for yourself!”</p><p>A piece of 
paper was shoved into the Martian’s face. She had been caught off-guard, but she took the 
paper nonetheless. <i>Is this... a test paper</i>?</p><p>“Oh, that’s right. I remember 
now... the re-test was scheduled for this morning, wasn’t it?” Her amethyst eyes trailed up 
to the red, circled score on the upper-right corner. Usagi was practically bouncing on the 
spot. Despite herself, Rei couldn’t help but smile. “Well, it’s not rocket scientist smart, 
but I’ll suppose it’ll have to do. A pass is a pass.”</p><p>“Pfft. Thanks a lot! It wouldn’t 
kill you to say something nice, would it?” She ripped the paper back in feigned anger. 
“But...I am grateful for your help. I’m so happy I think I could hug you. Actually, I think 
I will!”</p><p>“What?! Gah!” Before Rei could react, she was knocked right over and off her 
feet. In her mind she was glad that Usagi was happy, but she thought this was a bit 
excessive; it was the second time in her life when she thought she was a mistreated teddy 
bear, and this time it really bothered her.</p><p>“H-Hey, get off!” Usagi was surprised when 
she was roughly pushed off. “I’m glad you’re happy you passed, but please keep your hands to 
yourself!”</p><p>The blonde blinked back. “Oh! I’m sorry... It’s just...well, I was just 
really happy.” She smiled. “I guess it’s just something I do when I’m with my friends. But, 
if it bothers you, then I will try to refrain from doing it. I didn’t mean to make you feel 
uncomfortable.”</p><p>“It’s just... no, never mind.” Rei sighed. She was looking somewhat 
flush in the face, something that Usagi found adorably enduring.</p><p>“Hey, 
Rei...?”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Do you like anyone?” The words had slipped out before she could 
stop herself. It completely threw Rei in a loop.</p><p>“What?! W-What are you talking 
about?”</p><p>“So, you do?”</p><p>“NO!!” Usagi leaned back on her heels and was looking 
thoughtful, but Rei was close to sweating bullets. “Besides, what kind of question is 
that?”</p><p>“Oh. Well, it--it’s nothing. I was just curious, that’s all. Anyway, I also 
came to tell you that Haruka also passed as well. So we’ll be starting the next stage of our 
training today.”</p><p><b>Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!Tup!</b></p><p>They both paused when they 
heard a storm of footsteps coming closer.</p><p>“WOOOHOOOO! I FINALLY 
PASSED!”</p><p>“Uranus, would you please sit down and be quiet! You’ll wake everyone up!” 
Luna thundered after her. In the distance, the footsteps began to die down 
again.</p><p>“So...I see.” Rei sarcastically remarked.</p><p>“Eh heh...Well, I guess it’s a 
good thing that she’s so energetic.” Usagi smiled. “It’s never boring when she’s around. And 
besides, I think it’s a good thing for Luna. She’s been asleep this entire time just like 
me. So it’ll be good for her to get back into things.”</p><p>“I see.”</p><p>Usagi nodded and 
then stood up. Rei stood up as well.</p><p>“Well, that’s all I came to tell you. And, I’m 
very sorry for waking you up. I was just so excited that I couldn’t wait to tell 
you.”</p><p>Rei suppressed the urge to yawn. “Don’t worry about it. What are friends for, 
right?”</p><p>The comment made Usagi beam. “Well, I suppose I should be going now. There’s 
something else that I need to take care of. So...I’ll see you later? Remember, we’re all 
going to meet in the Great Hall an hour from now, so don’t be late!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah...” 
Rei finally yawned as the girl left. But as soon as she stepped back into her dim room and 
shut the door, she collapsed to her knees with a huge sigh of relief.</p><p><i>What was that 
about?!</i> She could feel her face burning, and her heart was racing for no absolutely no 
reason. She couldn’t get the feeling of being hugged out of her head—it almost made her want 
to squirm and bury her head underneath a pillow.</p><p><i>When she hugged me... it felt 
weird. I just didn’t want to be hugged by her.</i></p><p>“<i>Do you like 
anyone?”</i></p><p>She could see Minako hanging onto her arm during their adventures, how 
she hugged her all the time, the way she used to smile at her. It almost seemed silly not to 
let Usagi hug her simply because the Venusian custom between friends went farther than 
that.</p><p>Rei sighed to herself and hid her face in her hands. <i>Why did she have to say 
something like that?! What’s wrong with me...?</i> She took a deep breath and let her hands 
fall to her side. She doubted she could get back to sleep even if she wanted to. <i>Well, 
moping around won’t get me anywhere. I might as well get ready. Training starts in an hour 
after all. </i>She got back onto her feet and went to get dressed.</p><p>Sometime later, Rei 
heard a knock at her door again. It was about time that she needed to leave for the Great 
Hall so she assumed it was the over-enthusiastic Moon Princess again.</p><p><i>I guess that 
must be Usagi. Doesn’t she even know when to quit?</i> Rei walked over to the door and 
opened it. “Again? You’ve really got to stop doing this--” She stopped; the world seemed to 
stop spinning. There was a blonde-haired woman standing there, but it wasn’t 
Usagi.</p><p>Only one thought came to mind and her body did the 
rest.</p><p><i>Mina.</i></p><p><i><b>Slam!</b></i></p><p>Sweating profusely, Rei leaned her 
full weight against the door in an unusually rigid position. She couldn’t look the Venusian 
in the face, not now, not yet. There were so many thoughts flying through her mind at that 
moment. Things were happening too fast and she was nowhere near ready; the way that her 
cheeks were burning now made her want to hide her face in her hands and sob in some isolated 
corner at the ends of the universe.</p><p><i>This isn’t my day.</i> She whole-heartedly 
cursed any higher power who had such a twisted sense of humour to torture her like 
this.</p><p>“Rei?! Come on Rei! Let me in!” Minako banged persistently on the 
door.</p><p>“Why?” The Martian tried to say with a steady voice.</p><p>“Why? What kind of 
question is that? Why else? I just want to talk to you, of course!”</p><p>“At this time of 
the day?” Rei was beginning to regain some of her cool. “It’s still dark out!”</p><p>“Well, 
yeah, but—Hey! You’re up too, you know? What’s your 
excuse?”</p><p><i><b>Creeeeak.</b></i></p><p>The blonde started a little when the door 
suddenly swung open; Rei glared at her with an ‘I am not amused’ expression.</p><p>“I was--” 
Rei started, but she found her heart caught in her throat.</p><p>She was nearly face to face 
with Minako now, with only a few tempting inches separating them. All right, so maybe 
opening the door to argue back wasn’t such a good idea after all.</p><p>Momentarily her eyes 
fell to the soft pink lips that were so close and the vow that she’d ‘get it right next 
time’ boomeranged back and effectively bashed her in the face. There was no one else around. 
It was just the two of them. But with that fact, topped with her current distress, it was 
then that realization performed a hit and run:</p><p><i>I can’t do 
this!</i></p><p>“I-was-so-excited-about-training-that-I-couldn’t-sleep-alright?” She blurted 
out in one breath, and then went stomping off down the corridor with Minako following 
closely behind.</p><p>“Doing what? Hey! Where do you think you’re going?”</p><p>“Away.” Rei 
increased the pace.</p><p>“Where?”</p><p>“To the Great Hall.”</p><p>“Then I’ll go with 
you.”</p><p>“No.” Oops, that just slipped out.</p><p>“What? Why not?”</p><p>“Umm… just 
cause.”</p><p>“REI!” Minako threw up her arms in frustration. Any faster and they would be 
jogging! “What is wrong with you? I just want to talk to you for Goddess’s 
sake!”</p><p><i>Yeah, but I don’t want to talk to you! </i>Rei silently protested; her 
blush, to her dismay, still hadn’t faded. Even from their proximity she could feel Minako’s 
influence on her. <i>What would I say? Sorry Mina, I can’t face you right now because you’re 
making my body act in ways that I don’t want it to?</i></p><p>“HEY!”</p><p>Minako was left 
gaping slack jawed when the Martian broke out into a full out sprint without warning and was 
quickly leaving her behind in her dust. The blonde stood there for a moment, rooted in 
place. Then slowly, after a few seconds, her brain started to function again. Rei was 
running AWAY from her?</p><p><i>The hell?! </i>That didn’t just sting a little bit. It stung 
a lot. In fact, she was feeling a little annoyed right about now. <i>Oh no you don’t! Not 
after I took forever to drag my sorry butt out here at this Goddess forsaken time of 
morning!</i></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup---</b><i><b>ZOOOOOOOOOM!</b></i></p><p>Rei finally 
reached the stairway at the end of the corridor, thinking that she had successfully ditched 
Minako.</p><p><i>Sorry Minako. I-I just… I can’t… Not right now…</i> She panted and tried to 
catch her breath. <i>But, now I’m going to have to apologize later...</i></p><p>“Hm?” Her 
ears perked up. Did she just hear something? <i>The wind...is it just me or did it suddenly 
just get quiet?</i></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>The Martian whirled her 
head in the direction of the sound and was horrified by what she saw. There was a golden 
fireball headed straight at her! Or that’s what it looked like to her anyway; Minako was 
downright scary with that determined gleam in her eyes!</p><p>“I… said… I wanted… to talk! 
So… we… are… going, TO TALK!”</p><p><i>GAAAAAAAAH!</i> Rei silently screamed at the 
declaration. <i>What’s wrong with her?!</i></p><p>The raven-haired woman leapt down to the 
next floor, and dared to stop and meet the indignant glare that stared back at her from the 
top of the stairs. There were only twenty precious stairs and a wall that separated them 
now.</p><p>Minako placed her hands on her hips and tapped her foot impatiently. 
“Well?”</p><p>“Well what?” Rei frowned back.</p><p>“I haven’t got all day, you know. Come. 
Here!” She pointed at her feet.</p><p>Rei turned her back to the blonde and crossed her arms 
in an equally stubborn pose. “Hmph.”</p><p><i>Oh, that’s reeeeeal mature. </i>Minako griped 
to herself.</p><p>From the back angle Rei appeared to be her usual detached self. However, 
that was far from the truth. In reality, Rei was having an extremely difficult time keeping 
a straight face. Actually talking to Minako again and knowing that she wanted to talk to her 
was making her infuriatingly happy. No matter how hard she tried to keep focused on the 
seriousness of the situation, her mind kept creeping back to how much she wished Minako 
would wear less revealing clothing.</p><p>The first time she had met Minako and they were 
trying to figure out her measurements, the <i>‘what ifs’</i> said it 
all.</p><p><i>ARRRRRRRGH! What the hell?! Why am I acting a teenager who just hit 
puberty?!</i></p><p>“Hey, are you even listening to me?! We have to get to the Great Hall 
soon! If you don’t mind, I’d like to get this done and over with before then!”</p><p>“You 
can wait.”</p><p>“What did you just say?!”</p><p>“It’s not like you’re going to grow older 
anyway.” Rei turned around and waved at her casually. This earned her another dangerous 
stare. If Minako had ‘anger gauge’ from one to ten, with ten being the worst, Rei figured 
she just hit level seven.</p><p>“Maybe not, but you will.” Minako countered.</p><p>“…Point 
taken. BUT if I grow old waiting down here, I just might lose my hearing and you won’t be 
able to talk to me, now, would you?”</p><p>Rei barley registered the golden streak dashing 
up the stairs before she could take off down the corridor. Now she had done it. There was no 
way Minako was going to give up now, and, secretly, it was exciting. She was almost 
giddy.</p><p>The Martian cut through the corridor and down the stairwell at the other end to 
the lower level. She could almost hear the swarm of questions that were surely waiting for 
her if she was caught before then: Why did you run from me? Is there something on my face? 
You don’t like me anymore? Rei squirmed at the very thought of a Minako styled 
interrogation. Up ahead she could just make out the opening where the others were surely to 
be waiting.</p><p><i>Just a little further! </i>She had nearly made it to the exit when 
Minako’s footsteps suddenly stopped. <i>Her footsteps—they just...</i></p><p>A shadow loomed 
overhead.</p><p>“Oh no you don’t!”</p><p>“Huh?!”</p><p>Before the Martian yelp a heavy 
weight crashed down atop of her and roughly dragged her to the ground. Both her and Minako 
were sent tumbling-- dark and blonde hair being tossed everywhere-- as they slid to a halt 
in the Great Hall.</p><p>When the world finally stopped spinning, Rei released a long, 
regretful groan; Minako was on top of her, pinning her arms down at her sides and straddling 
her. There was no escape now.</p><p><i>This isn’t good…</i> She didn’t even need to look. 
She knew everyone was looking at them right now and she wished that Minako would hurry up 
and notice it too.</p><p>Minako breathed heavily for a moment, trying to catch her breath. 
She finally had Rei where she wanted her, but the way she had pinned the woman nearly made 
the blonde forget why she had sought the Martian in the first place. It was a sin the way 
Rei was so damn cute: The way her hair sprayed across the ground, how her lips were slightly 
parted as she breathed, and how her face was flush. The ‘Oh shit!’ in the woman’s amethyst 
eyes was also a nice bonus.</p><p><i>Hah...that’s right. You should be 
scared.</i></p><p>“Now, we’re going to talk.” Minako stressed ‘talk’ and Rei’s eyes widened. 
There was a strong pressure on her lower half—nearly making her squirm.</p><p><i>No. No. No. 
No! Minako!</i></p><p>“Ahem.” Someone delicately coughed.</p><p>Rei and Minako whipped their 
heads in the direction of the voice to see that Luna, and the others were all watching them 
with amused expressions. Beside them stood a white haired man who, unlike the others, was 
trying to look anywhere but at the two young women.</p><p>Minako’s grip automatically 
slackened and Rei was finally able to pull free. Together they both staggered back onto 
their feet as they awkwardly tried to ignore the snickers (mainly from Haruka).</p><p>Luna 
checked off Rei and Minako’s names from her list and lowered her clipboard.</p><p>“Now that 
we’re all here, let’s get started. First of all, I would like to congratulate all of you for 
passing your exams. Although it took some of you longer to pass than others, what matters 
the most is that you all may progress to the next stage of your training as a group. That 
said, since the next stage is not within my area of expertise, you will be instructed by 
Artemis.” She gestured to her companion. “If you girls remember from Setsuna’s meeting, he 
was the head of our combat division.”</p><p>Luna started to side-track into other details of 
their training, but Haruka wasn’t interested in listening. She stepped over to the Martian 
and saw her shoot a suspicious look back.</p><p>“So Rei, what was that just now, 
hm?”</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>“Nothing?” Haruka arched an eyebrow. “You’re telling me THAT was 
NOTHING? I’ve got to admit, that was sure an interesting position for ‘talking’.”</p><p>Rei 
glared at her, clearly losing her patience. “Drop it, Haruka.”</p><p>“What? Why? You don’t 
have to hide it from me, you know? I think it’s great that you two are finally 
together!”</p><p>“We aren’t together.”</p><p>“Oh sure, 
sure---”</p><p><i><b>WHACK!</b></i></p><p>“OUCH!” Haruka grimaced when Luna clobbered her 
with the clipboard. “Why you--”</p><p>“As I was saying,” The vice advisor continued, 
“Artemis, can you take it from here?”</p><p>The man grinned and then nodded.</p><p>“Sure 
thing. Leave it to me!”</p><p>“Then I will entrust them to you. And! No slacking off,” She 
reminded him as she passed by. He gulped nervously, drawing a few giggles from the 
women.</p><p>Once Luna had disappeared from sight, Artemis breathed a sigh of relief before 
he shifted his attention back to his new charges.</p><p>“So, did you girls have a nice 
rest?” He inquired in a light-hearted tone. The tired looks he was receiving from the 
majority of the group indicated to him otherwise, but he thought it would be polite to ask 
anyway. “What? Don’t tell me that three days wasn’t enough?”</p><p>“Three days of rest? I 
wouldn’t exactly call it relaxing… we were writing tests for most of the time.” Makoto 
pointed out. <i>Not exactly the most stress-free thing to do…</i></p><p>“Only because 
<i>some</i> people kept failing,” Rei muttered.</p><p>“Hey! That wasn’t my fault!” Haruka 
rose to her own defence. “That woman was trying to fail me!”</p><p>“She’s right.” Artemis 
agreed in a cheerful voice.</p><p>It took the group a second to realize what he had just 
said. He had said it so casually and naturally that they had almost missed the statement 
altogether.</p><p><i>She’s… right?</i></p><p>“I-I am?” Uranus blinked at him. “So, this 
entire time... you mean?”</p><p>“Yup, she purposely failed 
you.”</p><p><i><b>THUD!</b></i></p><p>Haruka felt like a ton of bricks had fallen atop of 
her head.</p><p>“Now, with that out of the way, I should warn you that from here on out 
things will get tough.” Artemis continued. “Being mentally prepared is a crucial aspect to 
fighting, but so is the physical aspect. Unless we build up your stamina and your spiritual 
control, you may never even reach Apollo. By now, it’s very possible that he has amassed an 
army of shadow assassins... or perhaps he has created a new adversary for you to face. 
Whatever the case may be, as I am sure that you all are aware of, there is always the risk 
that any of you may perish on the battlefield. That is the reality of things. So if you want 
to live and continue to protect what’s important to you, keep that in mind as you train! 
Train hard so that does not happen!”</p><p>Looking at the group, he could sense that his 
words were stirring nervousness in them. However, at the same time there was an equal surge 
of determination.</p><p>“Now, shall we get started?” Artemis led them all out into the 
courtyard out back. It was a clear field, exactly what many of them had come to expect for a 
physical session. “Before I begin I would just like to clarify something. Do all of you here 
know how to use Planet Power? What…? None of you have?” He was taken aback by the blank 
stares.</p><p><i>Are they really that far behind? </i></p><p>“We have.” Haruka raised her 
hand. “Myself and Michiru have, but I don’t think the others know quite 
yet.”</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>“Haruka, what is he talking about?” Rei whispered to her.</p><p>The 
blonde turned her head and whispered back, “Do you remember back on Neptune when I…” Her 
voice trailed off and smacked her forehead.</p><p><i>Oh great. How can I remind her that I 
went prancing around in a mini skirt during battle?</i></p><p>“When you what?”</p><p>“…Never 
mind, I’ll just show you,” She grumbled. Haruka raised her hand up and cried,</p><p>“Uranus 
Planet Power, Make-Up!”</p><p><b>FWOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p>The others blinked back as the 
golden light faded away, leaving behind a very irritated soldier of the wind.</p><p>In a 
skimpy outfit.</p><p>In a mini-skirt.</p><p>“This!” Haruka pointed and growled at the 
others.</p><p>“Oh.” <i>Now I remember. </i>Rei suppressed a snicker, promptly earning her a 
threatening glare.</p><p>“I see.” Artemis pondered as he analyzed his student’s attire. 
“Yes, there is no doubt about it. That is it.”</p><p>“What exactly is it though?” Makoto 
asked. She continued to stare at Haruka with wide eyes.</p><p>“Well, how to put it?” Artemis 
posed thoughtfully. “I suppose to start off you should know that it’s a very powerful 
technique that only the planet rulers can access. But since all of you meet that 
requirement, it shouldn’t be a problem to tap into it.”</p><p>He never noticed Rei turning a 
little pale at the information.</p><p>“Basically, for those who have never used it before, 
you may have noticed that your spiritual attacks are somewhat unpredictable.” He raised his 
hand and a bolt of white lightning shot out, somewhat startling the girls. “You see? When 
you summon your powers, it comes out as a strong blast of raw energy. There’s just no 
specific form to it. That’s why...we’re going to teach you how to use Planet Power. When you 
tap into it, your powers are going to condense into a concentrated, clearly defined attack. 
The sort of attacks you’ll be able to use, however, will depend on your planet’s affinity 
and the capacity of your spiritual power. Now, you might be wondering what I’m talking 
about. Since you’re already tapped in Uranus, would you please demonstrate?”</p><p>Still 
grumbling, Haruka unleashed a world shaking across the empty 
field.</p><p>“World…SHAKING!”</p><p><i><b>Wham! 
WrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrRrRrRRRRR---</b></i></p><p>The ball of energy vanished into the air a 
distance away.</p><p>“See?” Artemis inquired. “Between having a lightning bolt thrown at you 
and that, which do you think would be harder to counter?”</p><p>“That’s very interesting, 
but… how can one access planet power?” Ami spoke up with piqued interest.</p><p>“I think I 
will leave that lesson to the ones who have already figured it out. Uranus, would you mind 
taking over for a moment? I’m afraid that there is something that I must check up 
on.”</p><p>“Hey, why me?! Aren’t you supposed to be the one teaching us?!” She argued back 
at his retreating form.</p><p>“I will. Later,” He waved from a distance.</p><p>Artemis 
plopped himself down on the outer perimeter of the training area and proceeded to watch them 
intently. Haruka allowed herself to glare at him a little longer, finding herself very 
unimpressed with this acclaimed instructor of theirs.</p><p><i>Okay, so maybe I do know how 
to use Planet Power, but really, can that guy get any lazier?! What’s so important that he 
has to sit there and watch us like a stalker? Hmph. He better not fall asleep.</i></p><p>The 
wind ruler reluctantly re-directed her attention to the group of expectant stares. She found 
it particularly odd that Michiru was giving her the same questioning expression as the 
others.</p><p>“Hey, you know how to do it too! You don’t expect me to do this all by myself 
do you?!” Haruka crossed her arms. <i>Transform already!</i></p><p>“But I am helping.” 
Michiru said sweetly.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Well, someone needs to be the role model. And 
besides, you look adorable in a skirt!” She giggled.</p><p>Haruka gaped back at 
her.</p><p>“…Okay! Never mind then. So…umm… I guess we were going to have to tell you guys 
about Planet Power sooner or later. I guess this is a good time as any.”</p><p>“Hey, didn’t 
you say it was the reason why you disappeared from Uranus in the first place?” Rei pointed 
out.</p><p>“Yeah... It’s just like that guy said. Planet Power a great technique for 
concentrating our aura. Even though it might look silly, it’s insanely powerful. Do you guys 
remember when Setsuna showed us that vision about the war against Apollo? Believe it or not, 
that’s exactly the power that our mentors used when they overthrew him.”</p><p><i>That’s 
true, but I could’ve sworn that I’ve seen that outfit from somewhere else…</i> Rei recalled. 
In the vision that they saw from Saturn, the day that the Moon Kingdom fell, there was one 
individual who donned the same outfit. Cautiously, her eyes were drawn to where Hotaru 
calmly stood. <i>Was that Planet Power as well? Could it really be a power that’s so strong 
that it could potentially destroy an entire civilization...?</i></p><p>“I see.” Ami readily 
absorbed this information. “I did note such a thing her vision. However, I find it strange 
that my father never mentioned it once. Did Sir Uranus ever mention anything about it to 
you?”</p><p>“Nope, my mentor said shit all about it too.” Uranus remarked with a shrug. “I 
actually heard about it from Michiru, so I wouldn’t worry about it. I’m guessing that the 
old folks might’ve gotten around to mentioning it someday, but with the predicament that 
we’re in now, we don’t have the luxury to sit around and wait. So yeah, that’s why I went to 
Neptune. So I could learn the technique from Michiru. We just got it down when you guys 
finally showed up,” she added. “And theeen...we were attacked and you know the rest. With 
everything going on there was really no time to explain to all of you.”</p><p>“As Artemis 
has already mentioned, as far as we know of, Planet Power is restricted to those who are 
planetary rulers.” Michiru explained. “Haruka and myself have been successful in calling 
upon it, however, we cannot guarantee if the rest of you will be able to call upon it as 
well.” She particular looked to Rei and Minako.</p><p>“…”</p><p>“But... I suppose that is 
why we are here. To get started, I would like you to form a circle around Haruka and myself. 
We shall try this together as a group.”</p><p>She waited until everyone had ample space 
before moving on.</p><p><i>How to call upon it…</i></p><p>“Now, how can I describe it? 
Planet Power... comes from a bright, warm light within oneself. When I close my eyes and 
look deep inside, there is a glowing sphere of my aura. To be able to call upon that power, 
you need to understand that it is a part of you, but at the same time is it not. When we are 
all born, we’ve inherited a piece of the planet’s life force. This forms a bond between 
one’s soul and the planet’s spirit, like an unbreakable thread that stays with us as long as 
we are alive. All living beings possess a bond of this type. However, those who were 
‘chosen’ by the planet to be the guardians of its people are granted greater access to this 
light if they so wish. In essence, the technique draws upon all of these connections and the 
planet’s very spirit itself.” She paused. “Now...when you wish to call upon it, close your 
eyes and find that light inside of you. Will yourself to reach for it, and embrace it. You 
may a feel a strong tug at first, but don’t try to resist it. Let it envelop 
you…”</p><p>When Michiru’s words died away there was a peaceful expression upon her face. In 
a matter of seconds an aquamarine light began to radiate around her form.</p><p>She whipped 
one of her hands out and cried:</p><p>“Neptune Planet Power, 
Make-Up!”</p><p><b>FWOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p>The light erupted into the area and then faded 
away, leaving the woman in an identical outfit to Haruka’s but in a different 
colour.</p><p>“So if we transform, we will look like THAT?” Makoto questioned Michiru’s new 
appearance.</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>“Mini-skirts in battle...?” <i>Seriously? </i>Makoto 
shook her head. <i>I wonder how the men dealt with it.</i></p><p>“Believe it or not, this 
form is more useful than you think. For one, it’s easier to move around in than it is in a 
suit of armor. And two, because it gives you a substantial boost to your spiritual powers it 
counters many of the disadvantages that one would expect.” Michiru pointed out. “With 
stronger powers, you should be able to fend off a majority of attacks.”</p><p>“So basically, 
you’re saying that if you avoid getting hit, it should be 
fine.”</p><p>“Essentially.”</p><p>“And if that’s not possible?”</p><p>“Revert back. It’s as 
simple as that.”</p><p>“Hey, I think we should have less chit chat and more action,” Haruka 
interrupted. “C’mon! Let’s see you guys give it a try!”</p><p>There was a moment of 
awkwardness as the rest of the young women fumbled to initialize the technique; there were 
many questions, re-explanations, and demonstrations. Until, finally, one other 
succeeded.</p><p><i>So, I’m supposed to be looking for a sphere of light? </i>Ami repeated 
Michiru’s words to herself. <i>I do feel something... But it’s so far, deep down. Wait, 
what’s that? I can see something! </i>A ray of blue light blinded her vision. She followed 
the warmth to its source, to a small glowing sphere within the dark well.</p><p><i>Is that 
it? Is that…?</i></p><p>She reached out for it.</p><p>“Mercury Planet Power, 
Make-Up!”</p><p><b>FWOOOOOOOOSH!</b></p><p>To Ami’s amazement, after the light receded she 
was suddenly clothed in a new outfit similar to that of Haruka and Michiru’s.</p><p>“O-Oh 
my…” Her face reddened as she pulled down at the front of her skirt. Although she had been 
expecting it, the actual accomplishment still terribly embarrassed her.</p><p>“You did it.” 
Michiru smiled in her ‘Congratulations.”</p><p>“T-Thank you…”</p><p>There were other 
unsuccessful tries until Makoto also joined the group (although, her reaction was rather 
timid as well, much like Ami’s).</p><p>“It’s so short!” The brunette squeaked. She couldn’t 
believe how much leg was showing!</p><p>“Deal with it!” Haruka grinned evilly. <i>Now if 
only Rei would do it too and I can…</i> The thought brought her to pause. Her green eyes 
peered over at the frustrated Martian a distance away; the woman’s back was stubbornly 
turned away from the rest of the group as she continually growled to herself in growing 
frustration.</p><p>“…Make-Up? Oh, come on!”</p><p><i>I… I just can’t feel anything!</i> 
<i>What am I supposed to be looking for again? Some kind of light...? </i>Rei stared at her 
hand in annoyance. All thoughts of earlier this morning flew out of the window as her 
frustration mounted. <i>Why can’t I do it? Even as a substitute leader, I…</i></p><p>The 
words finally registered.</p><p><i>It won’t work because I’m a ‘substitute’... If that’s 
true, then it would make sense. I guess only a real planetary leader can use this power, 
like Ares. </i>Her stance suddenly straightened up and disappointment flickered in her dark 
eyes. All of her efforts up to now had been doomed to failure before she had even 
begun.</p><p><i>So, that’s it, isn’t it? The way I am now, I can’t get any stronger... 
</i>It almost felt ironic. <i>Then that means...the only way I’ll have a chance of surviving 
this is...</i></p><p><b>FwoooooOOOOOOOoooossssh…</b></p><p>“Hey buddy!” A hard hand clapped 
down hard on the Martian’s shoulder. Haruka leaned in close by her ear and whispered, “Don’t 
worry about it, all right? It seems like you aren’t the only one.” She indicated to the 
twins at distance away.</p><p>Another flash lit the area, and Minako had 
transformed.</p><p>“I’m not worried.” Rei growled, and shrugged her hand off. It didn’t 
matter if Hotaru and Usagi couldn’t summon the technique. All she was interested in was 
Minako. It stung that the Venusian was able to do it and she couldn’t.</p><p>At a distance 
away, Artemis observed the girls with interest—especially the twins and the 
Martian.</p><p><i>Hmm...</i><i> It appears that Lady Usagi and Lady Hotaru cannot utilize 
Planet Power quite yet? That’s rather strange... and the girl from Mars as well? </i>He 
glanced at Rei arguing with Haruka. <i>There shouldn’t be any problem for a ruler to access 
the technique.</i></p><p>At last, Artemis stood up. However, instead of approaching his 
charges he left to report his observations to another authority.</p><p><u>(Artemis, Entrance 
to the city)</u></p><p>“So, this is where you are. I thought you were supposed to be 
resting.”</p><p>“You aren’t going to watch them?”</p><p>Artemis cautiously approached her 
comrade. Setsuna stood motionless against the wind, her crimson eyes never leaving the 
vacant city. It appeared that the city only lit up during the night-time.</p><p>“Well, we 
seem to have a problem, Setsuna. Not all of the young women can call upon Planet Power. When 
you told me that they needed some training, I didn’t expect them to be this far behind. Did 
you know about 
this?”</p><p>Silence…</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>fwoooooOOOOOoooooshhh…</b></i></p><p>“Lady Usagi 
and Lady Hotaru… and the woman from Mars--”</p><p>“The Martian is human.”</p><p>Artemis was 
taken aback. “She is?! But, I thought you said that they were all rulers of their respective 
planets. I don’t mean to sound rude, but...how is it possible that a human could inherit a 
throne and not become a God?”</p><p>“She is the substitute ruler. The real ruler is still at 
large, and is now our enemy.” Setsuna clarified.</p><p>“You mean...Sir Ares 
is...?”</p><p>“As for Lady Usagi, it is quite possible that she will require some additional 
time to awaken her powers. While Lady Hotaru… there is no need to worry about the child.” 
<i>That one has already…</i></p><p>“Wait, hold up a second. This is all kind of important 
information, don’t you think? Why am I only hearing about it now? Did you foresee any of 
this? What do you know that we don’t?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“You were... always like this,” he 
said, with disappointment evident in his voice. “You’re always keeping everything to 
yourself. Why? Even after you joined Queen Serenity’s court... At first, I thought that you 
were quiet because you needed some time to adjust. But after awhile, I came to realize that 
you preferred to be left alone. To be honest, it was a bit disappointing, but I could 
respect that. But now...”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Everyone else is gone. The three of us is all 
that is left now! I don’t know if I’m asking for too much, but...can you try to be a little 
more open with us? You don’t have to do everything alone anymore.”</p><p><i>Artemis... 
</i></p><p>“...I understand.”</p><p>“Do you really mean that? I mean, we’re here for 
you.”</p><p>“Yes. And it means a lot to me, thank you.”</p><p>Artemis was surprised that 
Setsuna admittedly something so openly, but any progress was good in his eyes.</p><p>“Then, 
that’s good.” <i>I was worried for a minute there.</i> “So, what are we going to do about 
the girls? There must be something we can do…”</p><p>She finally turned to face him. “The 
dilemma that we currently face is the strength of their spiritual powers. Although the 
majority of them are Goddesses, they are still young and inexperienced. Their spiritual 
strength is relatively undeveloped in comparison to their predecessors.”</p><p>“That’s true. 
But, as much as I hate to admit it, increasing their spiritual strength is a factor that 
relies heavily on time rather than effort. Even if I drilled them continuously non-stop for 
months, or years even, their aura capacity will not expand by very much. Unless we can 
miraculously come up with a way to increase their spiritual energies, we will be at a 
significant disadvantage in the upcoming war.”</p><p>“That is true.” Setsuna contemplated. 
“Apollo is no longer trapped within a physical body. The fact that he still lingers on this 
plane indicates that he is in all likelihood a mass of spiritual energy. No matter how many 
weapons one acquires, a metal blade will not be able to overcome him alone.”</p><p>“So then, 
that means...”</p><p>“We will require a miracle.”</p><p>The confidence in her tone prompted 
the man to wonder. “Do you have a plan?”</p><p>“Perhaps...”</p><p><u> (Artemis, 
Courtyard)</u></p><p>When Artemis returned to the field he found that the twins and Mars 
remained the last to make any progress. It appeared there had been no significant change in 
his absence. Ah well, that was about to change very soon.</p><p>“Rei, listen to me…” Uranus 
tried talking to her friend.</p><p>“It’s not going to work Haruka, I know. You don’t have to 
say anything.”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Is there a problem?” Artemis approached his two 
charges.</p><p>“Well you see…” Haruka sighed. She was about to explain it in the least 
humiliating way possible to their instructor, but Rei beat her to it.</p><p>“I can’t do it.” 
She said bluntly. She saw the knowing look in Artemis’s blue eyes and unconsciously braced 
herself for the snide remarks, but to her surprise none came.</p><p>“I see. Well, you gave 
it your best, so... I wouldn’t worry about it.” He saw Rei looked stunned at the comment. “I 
bet you’re one of those late bloomers. So, try not to be too hard on yourself. It’ll come 
with time. In the meantime, try to concentrate on what you can do now and sharpen those 
skills. Regardless of what lies ahead, I’m sure you will continue to be an important part of 
this team.”</p><p>Rei didn’t know what to say. She just stood there and watched as he 
proceeded to call the others in.</p><p>“All right everyone, gather ‘round” Artemis called 
out. Once everyone had assembled, he told them, “I see that most of you have awakened your 
powers. That’s very good. For those of you who haven’t, don’t worry about it,” He noted 
Usagi especially. “You will all be able to participate in this next activity 
regardless.”</p><p>“And that would be?” Ami questioned.</p><p>“Something that Uranus has 
been waiting for all this time. Fighting,” He remarked with a glint in his eyes. Haruka 
remained strangely silent at the news. “Normally, it’s best to worry about the little 
details first and then work our way up, but because we don’t know how much time we have to 
prepare, we have no choice but to go hard from the start.”</p><p>“You mean to play by the 
chances.” Rei quipped.</p><p>“Exactly,” He nodded. “You can practice a technique as many 
times as you’d like, but in the battlefield your opponents will fight back. They won’t stand 
by and let you attack them. Also, if you somehow mess up during a fight and are unprepared, 
you will find yourself at a severe disadvantage. That’s why you will all pair off and spar 
against one another. The goal of this exercise is to learn how to read your opponents 
movements and to quickly adapt to their actions. Since you all should be approximately 
evenly matched in power, use anything at your disposal to get the upper hand. Obviously, I 
do not mean to go as far as killing your partner, but I want you to push them to their 
limits. None of you will improve if you slack off and go easy on one another. In fact, that 
little bit of mercy may cost you your friend dearly in actual combat. Do you 
understand?”</p><p>He paused and scanned the faces to make sure they were paying attention. 
It was pleasant surprise to see he had their undivided attention.</p><p>“Wait a minute.” 
Uranus interrupted.</p><p>“Yes? Do you have a question?”</p><p>“You bet I do! Were you 
really the combat specialist for the Moon Kingdom?”</p><p>This prompted a muttering amongst 
the group.</p><p>“First you just walk off to who knows where and make someone else teach 
your lesson for you. And then when you finally get back, you tell us just to fight one 
another. What have you actually taught us? I say you should lead by example! Don’t go 
telling us not to slack off when that’s all you’ve been doing all this time!”</p><p>“Ah, I 
see. So you would like a lesson?” Artemis asked calmly.</p><p>“Why not?” Haruka’s green eyes 
flashed back. “Unless your skills have rusted over time…”</p><p>“Wait Haruka, don’t do this! 
He’s really strong!” Usagi tried to warn her.</p><p>“Is he really? Or is that just some 
title he carries around for show? I came here to fight dammit! I want to get stronger! I 
didn’t come all this way to write some lame tests, so there’s no way in Hell I’m going to 
waste my time taking orders from a lazy slacker!” Her angry eyes trained on the Moon 
Princess and Usagi flinched back. “Besides... what would someone like you know about 
fighting? Where were you when the rest of us were sweating about whether we’ll survive or 
not?! I don’t even know why you’re still here! Everything about you, your eyes, your 
attitude, just-- everything is screaming ‘why do we have to fight?’! Look Princess, if you 
don’t want to fight, then don’t! Tch…Just the sight of you makes me sick.”</p><p>Usagi 
gasped.</p><p>“Haruka please—! That’s enough.” Hotaru spoke up on her sister’s behalf. 
However, she was unable to say more in her sibling’s defence as much of what Haruka said was 
true. She only wished that Haruka wasn’t so harsh with her words.</p><p>“Haruka, that was 
out of line!” Michiru scolded.</p><p>“Now, now, there’s no need to worry. It seems to me 
that Uranus is just a little frustrated, that’s all.” Artemis smiled.</p><p>“What did you 
just say?!”</p><p>But her angry didn’t bother the man in the least. Artemis flicked his 
wrist and a long spear materialized into his waiting palm. The fact that their instructor 
suddenly had a weapon in his hands startled many of his young students.</p><p>“I have no 
problem with accepting your challenge. However, why don’t we make this a little more 
interesting?” He asked Haruka. As he said this, the spear began to glow with a white 
light.</p><p>“What do you mean?” She eyed him suspiciously.</p><p>“You said that you didn’t 
want to listen to a slacker, so... how about a wager? If you can defeat me, you can do 
whatever you like. However, if I win... all of you will have to participate in my sparring 
activity. Does that sound fair?”</p><p>“Heh. Fine.” <i>This will be a piece of 
cake.</i></p><p>“Also.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“If anyone else wishes to join, then they may. In 
fact, I encourage it. You may find...that I’m more formidable than I 
look.”</p><p><b>PING!</b></p><p><i><b>FwooooooOOOOOSH!</b></i></p><p>Artemis held up his 
spear and the energy erupted into the area. Strong winds shot up around the entire field, 
followed by an intense pressure. The magnitude of his spiritual force was daunting, but it 
didn’t end there. It was steadily growing.</p><p>“Arrrgh!!” Everyone shielded their eyes 
from the light. The wind was actually pushing them backwards.</p><p><i>Is that really 
Artemis? His power is enormous!</i> Rei shielded her eyes from the light.</p><p>“Now this is 
more like it!” Haruka smirked. She then raised her hand.</p><p>“World… 
SHAKING!”</p><p><i><b>Wham! 
</b></i><b>Wrrrrrrr</b><i><b>rrrrrrrrrrrrrrRrRrRRRRR</b></i><b>---Whack!</b></p><p>Artemis 
swatted the attack away with ease.</p><p>“What?! No! That’s impossible!” Haruka cried out. 
<i>He swatted it away like it was nothing!</i></p><p>She leapt to the side as a bolt of his 
power shot her way. It harmlessly hit the ground as Michiru sprinted forward to try her 
luck. The man watched her close the distance and entered into close hand to hand combat with 
the young lady. Michiru lashed out at him with carefully coordinated strikes, but Artemis 
evaded them all with equally deadly precision. After a few seconds of fighting with him, 
Michiru realized that her efforts were no more but child’s play to him.</p><p><i>He’s 
evading all of my attacks as if they were nothing! Why isn’t he forcing me back with his 
spear?</i> She punched at him a few more times, all just narrowly missing. When she glimpsed 
the smile on Artemi’s face it was then that she realized: <i>He’s not taking me 
seriously!</i></p><p>A break in the air to her far side alerted her of her partner’s 
approaching presence.</p><p>“Haruka, don’t get too close!” Michiru shouted over the wind. 
“He’s stronger than you think he is!”</p><p>But Haruka had already closed the 
distance.</p><p>“HaaaaaaAAAAAAH!” She leapt into the melee and unleashed her own series of 
punches and kicks. “Let’s see what you’ve got!”</p><p><b>Whup, whup, whup, 
blam!</b></p><p>Artemis knocked Haruka’s leg upwards and swung his weapon around. The butt 
end of his spear jabbed into her mid-section, temporarily winding her. But before Haruka 
could straighten up, one of his hands were in her face; a blast of wind sent her flying 
back.</p><p><b>BLAM!</b></p><p>“Arrrrrgh!” She hit the dirt ground and rolled hard along it 
for over five meters, limps flailing everywhere, until she came to an abrupt stop. When she 
did, it felt like her brain had been rattled. There was an intense ringing her in 
ears.</p><p>“Haruka!” She could hear her friends shout from the sides.</p><p>“Haruka!” 
Michiru turned to look. However, Artemis wasn’t about to let her rest. He brought down his 
spear, purposely giving her just enough time to evade it. The weapon crackled as it 
contacted the ground, and created a small crater where it touched only seconds 
before.</p><p><i>Did you see that?</i></p><p><i>Such power!</i></p><p>The group of women 
thought.</p><p>“D-Damn it...!” Haruka groaned and struggled to prop herself up onto her 
elbows. With one of her hands she wiped away the blood from her cut lip.</p><p><i>W-When did 
he become this strong?! Was he always like this? I-I thought I had him... but then, out of 
nowhere! </i>She remembered glimpsing his hand before she was hit. She hadn’t even seen it 
coming. <i>It was so fast--I couldn’t move!</i></p><p><i>He’s so strong.</i> Minako stared 
hard at the two combatants, and watched as Michiru continued to struggle. <i>And he’s our 
ally? So, does that mean that our enemy is even stronger than this? </i>She tensed up and 
remembered her earlier promise to help win the war. She didn’t realize it until now, but the 
fear of the war suddenly felt that much more real. She nervously looked over to Rei and saw 
the same look of astonishment in the Martian’s dark eyes.</p><p>“Min---Minako?!” Rei shouted 
when the blonde suddenly charged into battle. “What are you doing?!”</p><p>She was tempted 
to run after her, but the rational side of her advised against it. She was painfully aware 
of the gun pocketed in her clothing more than ever. She narrowed her eyes in 
frustration.</p><p><i>...Shit! </i></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>“Hah, Hah, Hah!” 
Minako stopped a short distance from her new opponent. Without any thought, the words came 
to mind and her body was wrapped in golden light.</p><p>“Venus… Love-Me Chain!”</p><p>A 
chain made of hearts lashed out towards their new enemy. Artemis barely raised one hand and 
the attacked was repelled by an invisible force field.</p><p>“What?!” <i>No! I can’t... give 
up!</i> Minako quickly took the alternative and materialized both of Venus’s chains at once. 
She had barley raised them when she heard Rei cry out,</p><p>“Minako, look 
out!”</p><p><b>Crackle!</b></p><p>Minako’s eyes widened when a bolt of white lightning 
suddenly hit her square in the chest and sent the Venusian flying back like Haruka before 
her. “Augh!” <b>THUD! </b>She crashed to the ground and rolled. She was vaguely aware that 
her chains were trailing behind her and came to lie messily on the ground around her 
battered body.</p><p>Usagi and Hotaru both tensed as they watched Minako violently cough 
when she came to the stop. The whole world was spinning.</p><p><i>W-What happened?</i> 
Vaguely she could sense that their opponent’s power was still 
growing.</p><p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p><p>“World…SHAKING!”</p><p><b>KABOOM!</b></p><p><b>Crackle—crackle!</b></p><p><b>KABOOM!</b></p><p><b>…</b><b>CRACKLE!</b></p><p>She 
was startled when she suddenly felt another presence rush past her. It couldn’t 
be.</p><p>“Wait, Rei...! Don’t do it!” <i>He’s too strong for you!</i></p><p>Rei didn’t hear 
the protest and went straight for her opponent’s backside while Michiru and Haruka 
distracted him. All she could see was the bolt of lightning hitting Minako. The moment it 
happened, she thought her heart had stopped.</p><p>“HaaaaaAAAH!!” The Martian brandished her 
sword. “Take this!”</p><p>Rei threw her weight into a downward slash and hit Artemis’s 
barrier. It flickered upon impact but it did not shatter.</p><p><b>WOOOOOM!</b></p><p>“Hm?” 
Artemis cocked his head. He never realized so many of his students would join in.</p><p>To 
the raven-haired woman’s surprise the man simply turned his head away and ignored 
her.</p><p>“Geh...! Hey!” <i>Don’t-- ignore me!</i> She summoned up her aura and forced it 
into her blade, strengthening her attack. However, Artemis continued to invest his attention 
towards Haruka and Michiru. This bruised Rei’s pride, re-opening many sore wounds that fed 
the dangerous power within her.</p><p>“Rei! Get out of there!” Haruka shouted to her. 
Artemis’s shield was beginning to expand in a circular radius, but Rei refused to 
budge.</p><p><i>I don’t like that look in her eyes!</i></p><p>“Rrrg---!!!” <i>I won’t...let 
you...beat me!</i> The crimson flames around her sword grew 
brighter.</p><p>“Rei!”</p><p>“Forget it Haruka! She’s not going to listen!” Michiru cried 
over the explosions. <i>That foolish 
woman!</i></p><p>“Deep…SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>KABLAM!</b></p><p>Rei winced when a bolt of 
Artemis’s power sliced her left cheek and drew blood. Her heart quickened at the smell and 
her pupil’s constricted.</p><p><i><b>Lubb Dubb!</b></i></p><p><i>Oh no! That feeling! If 
this keeps up, I’ll--!! </i>But the winds were so strong now that she feared that they would 
tear her apart if she tried to run away, and there was no way she would be able to 
administer the medicine in this position. She was stuck.</p><p>“Hang on Rei! Sparking…Wide 
Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua Illusion!”</p><p>“Venus…Love-Me 
Chain!”</p><p><b>BOOM!</b></p><p><b>WoOoOoOSH!</b></p><p><b>Shiiiiiiiink--!</b></p><p>“!”</p><p>Artemis’s 
barrier flickered. <i>What? More of them have joined?</i> His thoughts were interrupted when 
he saw peculiar dots appear in the sky above. Before he could contemplate on it, purple 
lightning rained on the field. The man’s barrier was weakened considerably.</p><p>“Ugh--! 
So, even Lady Hotaru is intrigued enough to join in.”</p><p>Usagi watched from the side as 
her twin sister entered the fray, clearly hesitating to take part herself.</p><p><i>Hmm… if 
Lady Hotaru joins, then this will have to end sooner than I anticipated. What a shame. They 
were all doing rather well.</i></p><p>“Barrier, disperse!” Artemis cried. Briefly his shield 
flickered and shattered! Its power washed over the area in waves, momentarily paralyzing all 
movement towards him.</p><p>There was no warning before he leapt forward and struck his 
charges down with lightning speed.</p><p><b>Whup!</b>- 
<b>Whup!</b>-<b>Whup!</b>-<b>Whup!</b>-<b>Whup!-Whup!</b></p><p><b>THUD!</b><b>!</b></p><p>“OOF!”</p><p>Each 
woman had been knocked to the ground except for Hotaru.</p><p>With a nervous smile, Artemis 
pointed his spear towards his former student. “Well, isn’t this unusual? Do you intend to 
fight me as well?” For a second his will wavered when he briefly sensed a strong surge of 
power in the young Lady. He knew that if she was serious, she could not only win but kill 
him.</p><p>But Hotaru seemed to have no intention of raising her blade against her teacher. 
“I think...this lesson is over. It seems clear to me who has won. Don’t you 
agree?”</p><p>Artemis looked surprised for a moment, but he eventually yielded. With an 
understanding smile and dismissed his weapon.</p><p><i>...Very well.</i></p><p>“That was 
very good!” Artemis praised his battered students and clapped. He heard them all groan as 
they picked themselves up off the ground. “Although all of you still need a lot of practice, 
I have to admit, for a first try I am impressed! With time, you all could be formidable 
opponents alone. However, I do believe that I’ve won our wager, Uranus. That is, unless one 
of you would like to have a second round!”</p><p>He laughed when he heard them all groan 
again.</p><p><u>(Training Yard)</u></p><p>As Artemis had requested, everyone split up into 
pairs. Ami and Makoto, Usagi and Hotaru, and Haruka and Michiru all paired off, leaving both 
Minako and Rei left behind. Rei wasn’t sure whether she should consider herself lucky or 
cursed.</p><p>“So...I guess we’re partners.” Minako tried to say casually.</p><p>“I guess.” 
Rei shrugged.</p><p>They both began to walk across the field where the last open space 
remained in awkward silence, but Rei was stopped briefly as she passed by Haruka. The tall 
woman caught her by the shoulder and dragged her back.</p><p>“Wha--!” She gave an 
exasperated sigh when she saw who it was. “What do you want now?”</p><p>She was surprised 
when Haruka placed both hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye with a serious 
expression.</p><p>“Hey, I don’t want you getting mad at me, but... is everything 
okay?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“During the fight, you just suddenly stopped. When I told you to 
get away from him, why didn’t you?” <i>That look in her eyes...For an instant, it looked 
like she was really afraid of something. </i>“Your condition isn’t bothering you, is it? If 
it is maybe you should sit out and rest for a bi--”</p><p>Rei forcefully pulled out of her 
grip before she could finish, and shot her a glare. There it was again: That pitying 
look.</p><p>“Rei.”</p><p>“There’s nothing wrong with me! So just—back off already, okay? 
It’s none of your business...” With that, she whirled around and marched purposely over to 
where Minako was patiently waiting. But she quickly found out that perhaps Haruka’s 
observations were quite obvious.</p><p>As Rei and Minako took their respective positions 
across from each other, she found Minako staring at her with a peculiar 
expression.</p><p><i>Why is she staring at me like that?</i> She didn’t really like it, 
well, she did, but it was complicated.</p><p>“Is... something wrong?” She asked 
tentatively.</p><p>“Well, I could be wrong but...No, it’s, never mind...”</p><p>“No, what 
were you about to say?” She saw the Venusian hesitate again. But she patiently waited until 
she got an answer.</p><p>“...You just... look a little pale, that’s all.”</p><p>Rei felt her 
heart skip a beat, and the feeling in her chest clenched.</p><p>“I think it’s just you,” she 
remarked in a sharp tone. When she saw the hurt look in the blonde’s face, she added, 
“Besides, we’re supposed to be sparring, remember? You’re supposed to treat me like the 
enemy! Are you going to stop a fight because they don’t meet your 
expectations?”</p><p>“Well, that’s—Look, if you aren’t feeling well, I just 
thought--”</p><p>“Well you thought wrong. I was just running this morning, remember?” She 
huffed.</p><p>Minako heard the note of finality in her voice, but as much as she wanted to 
yell at the Martian for being so rude and inconsiderate she felt that there was something 
seriously wrong. Rei was sometimes blunt, she was never this bad. She was on the edge for 
some reason. Not only that, but there was something deep inside that was against this entire 
exercise. In truth, for some reason that she couldn’t explain, she really didn’t want to 
fight against Rei even if it was just a light match.</p><p>“Are you ready?” Rei drew her 
sword and bent down into an offensive position.</p><p>Minako was strangely quiet. All around 
them she could hear everyone else beginning their matches, and to the side she could feel 
Artemis looking their way. They were the only ones who hadn’t started yet.</p><p><i>Well, I 
guess we might as well get this over with. The sooner I beat her, the sooner we can just sit 
down and talk. But... it seems like an awful lot of work just to talk to someone. 
</i></p><p>In the back of her mind, she wondered if Rei would even give her the chance to 
speak her mind after it was all over given the Martian’s current mood.</p><p>Minako 
materialized her chains just as Rei ran forward. It was a predictable strike; she swung her 
sword at her, but the Venusian evaded her strikes without too much trouble. However, Rei 
continued to press forwards until Minako swung her chains and forced her back.</p><p>As 
their matched continued on, Rei noticed something that nearly made her blood boil. Minako 
was only jumping around and dodging. It was like she wasn’t putting any effort into the 
fight at 
all.</p><p><i><b>Swing—</b></i></p><p><i><b>Swing---</b></i></p><p><i><b>Swing---</b></i></p><p>Finally, 
Rei smashed her blade against the ground and shot Minako and angry look. “Would you stop 
running away?! Why aren’t you taking this seriously? I know you can do better than 
this!”</p><p>Minako was silent for a moment. She had originally intended to whip her partner 
down and end the fight quickly, but somewhere along the way she found that she just 
couldn’t. The very thought of hitting her was making her hands tremble. Still, that didn’t 
excuse the way that Rei was treating her.</p><p><i>Wow, someone’s sure grumpy today. 
</i></p><p>“Maybe I’m just tired.”</p><p>“Somehow, I doubt that.”</p><p>The sarcastic 
comments were really starting to get on her nerves.</p><p><i>So! Let me get this straight. 
If I fight for real and beat her, then she’ll probably throw a temper tantrum and get angry. 
If that happens, then she probably won’t want to talk to me. But...if I don’t fight her and 
spar lightly, she’ll get angry anyway. </i>She sighed. <i>Jeez, this woman! </i></p><p>This 
time when Rei lunged forward, Minako’s chain whipped back so hard that it actually shoved 
her back.</p><p><i>There we go!</i></p><p>Rei kept pushing it, and as she did she was 
inspiring stronger strikes from her opponent. Before she knew it, Minako had begun to throw 
out bolts of her power as well. The Martian responded in kind and soon they both had slipped 
into a 
rhythm.</p><p><i><b>Slash-slash—Crackle!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shink---Ting!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>They 
tore up the ground around them. Soon, they were going harder than any of the other pairs in 
the area and were drawing a few curious gazes. One of these was from the twins nearby who 
were nearly hit by one of Minako’s stray bolts.</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“Yipe!” 
Usagi jumped when something loud blasted the ground beside her. She hadn’t been watching for 
that at all.</p><p>“Usagi, are you all right?” Hotaru asked.</p><p>“W-Well...I think so. 
But, what was that?”</p><p>The other pair to the other side of the battling pair was also 
not unaffected. Rei and Minako were moving so quickly that their movements were spreading 
out across the entire side of the field. When Rei threw another string of blasts in Minako’s 
direction, the Venusian leapt back directly into Ami and Makoto’s fighting area. Their 
friends shouted in surprise when the blonde landed between them and dragged a range of fire 
along their way. This drew a frown from Artemis.</p><p>As the fight continued, Minako’s 
concentration was beginning to become side-tracked once again.</p><p><i>That’s strange... 
why does this feel so familiar?</i> She whipped her chains in Rei’s direction and watched 
her evade them in slow motion. For a brief second, she thought she saw the scene replaying 
itself, but in it her opponent was torn up and bloody. She gasped; it startled her so much 
that her next attack was far off target.</p><p><i><b>Shink—</b></i></p><p>Silently, Rei 
watched the chain fly into the air at nothing. She didn’t give the peculiar behaviour a 
second thought though. Without thinking she did something that she normally wouldn’t have 
done. She extended her hand, wrapping it around the links despite the energy burning her 
flesh, and yanked forward with an inhuman strength. Minako yelped in surprise when she was 
brought down onto her hands and knees, but she was forced to quickly counter when the 
Martian threw her sword at her.</p><p><i><b>Slash!</b></i></p><p>“Agh!” Minako felt the 
blade dig across her right arm and stumbled back in shock. She couldn’t believe that she had 
been hit. But more importantly...</p><p><i>What—what’s going on? If I hadn’t moved, then she 
would have...</i> In her mind, there was no doubt that it was a move aimed to 
kill.</p><p>She brought her blue eyes up and looked the Martian in the eye. A very strange 
look had entered Rei’s dark eyes. They almost looked cold and hollow 
somehow.</p><p>“Rei...?” She whispered.</p><p>Her opponent charged forward again, and Minako 
stumbled back in a rush to fend her off. As the seconds dragged on, she felt everything 
spiralling out of control. Every attack she threw, Rei was taking it head on. She was 
allowing herself to get hurt.</p><p><i><b>Crackle! Crackle! Crackle!</b></i></p><p>“S-Stop 
it!” Her frantic shouts drew everyone’s attention.</p><p>“Minako?” Haruka turned her head 
just as Artemis narrowed his eyes at the sight.</p><p><i><b>Crackle!</b></i></p><p>Minako 
threw another bolt of power and this time it hit the woman in the leg. Rei tripped and hit 
her head against the ground fairly hard. Suddenly, the pain in her leg 
registered.</p><p><i>O-Ow! </i>She grabbed at her foot instinctively and bit down on her 
bottom lip. <i>W-What...?!</i></p><p>Minako felt her heart pounding in her chest as she saw 
Rei slowly lift her head and looked at her. Seeing Rei the way she was now, it was all 
coming back to her: The mission part of her memory. The images flashed in her mind one after 
another, as if they were articulating the brutality of an enraged 
Goddess.</p><p><i>Goddess...!</i> <i>Is that what happened? </i>She remembered when Rei hit 
her with something in her neck. Was that why Rei refused to tell her what happened after 
they had left Venus?</p><p>Rei stared back and saw the horror in Minako’s face. The pain 
that she was in, it dawned on her. The blood drained from her face, and suddenly it was 
difficult to breathe. The memory of her nightmare came back full force, but at the moment 
she didn’t want to see Minako look at her like that.</p><p>“Mina...ko.” Rei staggered up to 
her feet. “I--” She winced when the blood from the Venusian’s arm stirred up her instincts 
again. For a brief moment, the gold light in her eyes flickered.</p><p>“N-No...stay 
back.”</p><p>“Minako.”</p><p>Unknown to Rei, one of the chains twitched at the 
side.</p><p>“Don’t come any closer!”</p><p>“But--”</p><p>“I said...DON’T!”</p><p>In that 
instant, the chain leapt to action. Rei had barely turned her head when she realized that 
she was being attacked. Both combatants were shocked when Usagi suddenly leapt in the 
way.</p><p>“Usagi!”</p><p>“Don’t do it!”</p><p>Minako saw the Princess and in that instant 
her concentration broke. The chain diverted to the far side, swinging widely and missing the 
pair altogether.</p><p><i><b>Swiss—Kablam!!!</b></i></p><p>“Please stop fighting!” Usagi 
said again. “She can’t fight back!”</p><p>Realizing what was happening, Rei’s eyes widened. 
“Usagi.” She shouted to her.</p><p>“Because...”</p><p>“Usagi!”</p><p>“...She’s 
sick!”</p><p>Minako thought her heart was about to stop when she heard those words. “Sick?” 
She repeated. It felt like an eternity when the word finally sunk in. She saw the Martian 
turn her head away when she looked at her. “What do you mean...sick? You said you were 
fine.”</p><p>“...It’s not like that.”</p><p>Minako was strangely silent for a moment.“...I 
think that’s enough for today. C’mon, we’ll get someone to look at you,” She stepped forward 
and extended her hand, but there was a loud smack when Rei slapped it away. Minako was in 
shock.</p><p>“...Just...leave me alone.” She mumbled.</p><p>“But--!”</p><p>“Just go 
away!”</p><p>“Rei!” Haruka ran up just as the Martian stormed off. Usagi considered running 
after her, but Haruka caught her. “Wait. It’s not a good idea for you to go after her. I’ll 
go.”</p><p>After she ran off, Minako just stood there looking stunned. She was just so angry 
and confused.</p><p>“Well fine!” She shouted and then ran off in the opposite 
direction.</p><p>“Uhh...” Artemis looked left and right, but now they were short two people. 
“I guess that’ll be it for today everyone. Please consider the rest of your day free time. 
You are dismissed.”</p><p>(Rei, Palace Gardens)</p><p>The sun was setting outside when 
Haruka finally approached her friend. She found Rei hidden on the other side of the palace, 
tucked into the corner of a hill that begun to slump down towards the city. She didn’t even 
turn to look when she walked right up to her.</p><p>“Mind if I sit down?” When the Martian 
said nothing, Haruka just took a seat beside her. For a moment, they both stared out at the 
city, watching it being bathed under the pink and yellow light. “You know, I guess we both 
came out as losers today,” Haruka finally said. She leaned back on the grass and stared up 
at the sky. “I mean, I got beaten up by that guy in front of everybody...It was pretty 
embarrassing.”</p><p>She turned and looked at Rei, but she could see that she was still 
sulking.</p><p>“Hey...I’m... really sorry about earlier.” This time she got a 
reaction.</p><p>“Sorry? What do you have to be sorry for?”</p><p>“Well, I guess for 
everything. Lately, it feels like you’ve been withdrawing from everyone...and I can’t help 
but feel like some of it is my fault. When I teased you earlier, I didn’t mean to hurt your 
feelings. I’m sorry...”</p><p>She heard Rei sigh. “It’s not your 
fault...”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“It’s just...There’s a lot on my mind at the moment. I didn’t 
mean to snap at you either.”</p><p>“Hey, it’s not a problem. Don’t worry about it. In fact, 
I think I get like that sometimes too. Now that we aren’t constantly fighting for our lives, 
I’ve been thinking... Like, how will this war will turn out...How many might die for this 
cause, because, so many have already died fighting and there’s no way we can take on a huge 
army by ourselves. It’s almost overwhelming when I think about 
it.”</p><p><i>Haruka...</i></p><p>“Do you remember when you told me on Neptune that the old 
man died? Even though I already knew that, I didn’t really grieve, you know? But now...It’s 
all kind of sinking in. I think I almost miss him...”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Haruka chuckled. 
“Yeah, I think it’s strange too...but, I guess what they say is true. You never realize 
what’s important to you until it’s gone.”</p><p>Rei looked away. “To be honest... I never 
really thought about any of that. Wow, I’m selfish...”</p><p>“What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“Because these last few days, while you were worrying about everyone else, I’ve 
been worried about myself.”</p><p>“I don’t believe that.”</p><p>“No, really--”</p><p>“No.” 
Haruka said firmly. “Rei, you’re really a good person...but I think, sometimes you’re too 
dishonest with yourself. Just because you worry about yourself once n’ awhile, it doesn’t 
make you selfish. You’re a person like the rest of us.”</p><p>“Haruka...”</p><p>“But, you’re 
also one of the closest friends that I have. So, if there’s something bothering you, then 
I’d really like to help, even if it’s just by listening... But if you don’t want to tell me, 
I’ll respect that. I just want you to know that, no matter what happens, if you ever need 
someone to talk to... I’ll always be here for you, okay?”</p><p>“Thanks. That means a 
lot...” She looked at the determination in Haruka’s eyes and almost smiled at that. “Pfft, 
you really want to know, don’t you?”</p><p>“Well, maybe a little...” Haruka admitted 
bashfully. She was surprised though because Rei actually smiled.</p><p>“Well, how can I say 
it?” Rei finally confessed. “It seems so complicated, but then again...maybe it’s only 
complicated to me. I was just thinking, that you may be right. Lately, all I’ve been doing 
is running away. I don’t know why, but ever since you guys arrived, Minako has been avoiding 
me. At first, I thought I was just imagining it... but then I realized that she was really 
angry at me.”</p><p>“Do you know why?”</p><p>“Well... at first, I wasn’t sure. But now, I 
think it’s because I’ve been avoiding her too.”</p><p>Haruka nearly slapped her head. “Huh? 
Come again...?”</p><p>“I’ve been having this dream lately, Haruka. Every time, I lose 
control of myself...and then, I end up hurting someone.”</p><p>“It wasn’t Minako was it?!” 
She saw the look in Rei’s eyes and realized that it was. “And what happened in the training 
yard today...”</p><p>“Mm...I took the medication this morning like I always did, but for 
some reason it just acted up again. Before I knew it, I woke up on the ground all confused, 
and Minako...the way that she was looking at me. You should have seen it.”</p><p>“Rei...” 
She was surprised when Haruka nudged her shoulder. “Well, that’s an easy enough problem to 
fix. Just take the doses more frequently.”</p><p>“But--”</p><p>“That’s how Ami designed it. 
If you think you need it then you should’ve just taken it.”</p><p>“But Minako would have 
seen it.” She said in a flat voice.</p><p>The statement startled Haruka. “You mean, you 
haven’t told her yet?” Rei shook her head. “But why not? I thought you guys were really 
close.”</p><p>“Because...!”</p><p>“Hey, I know it’s a big deal to you, but... I don’t think 
she’d think any less of you if you told her.”</p><p>“You don’t know that.”</p><p>“That’s 
true.” She saw Rei look up. “But, the way I see it, she’s probably has her share of 
suspicions after what happened today. If you don’t try to talk to her, then it could get 
worse. Besides, it’s always hard to find these kinds of things out by accident...especially, 
when it concerns a friend.” Haruka remember how she felt when she confronted Rei about it on 
Neptune. It hurt that she hadn’t been told about something that important, that her friend 
had to struggle with it by herself for who knew how long. “Why were you avoiding her 
anyway?”</p><p>She blinked when she saw that Rei was blushing.</p><p>“W-Well... If I tell 
you, then you have to promise that you won’t tell anyone.”</p><p>“Oh, okay... I promise. So, 
what is it?”</p><p>“...Well, I think...I think that I... l-like her.” She squeaked 
out.</p><p>Haruka stared at her wide-eyed. <i>You mean... you just realized that?!</i> She 
noticed that Rei was beginning to go into a ramble now.</p><p>“I-It’s just really 
complicated! I like being around her, but when she’s away I’m always worrying! It’s like I 
was losing sleep over it! But then when she came back and started avoiding me--I didn’t know 
what to do...” Her friend couldn’t help but feel sympathetic towards that look. The Martian 
looked like a hurt puppy. “Then I had that dream, and I thought that if she stayed around 
me, I might accidentally hurt her...like today...”</p><p><i>Just like Setsuna said. She said 
the medication wouldn’t be enough.</i></p><p>“So, you were worried that you might hurt her.” 
Haruka pondered. “But, she’s a lot stronger now, you know? I think, today, you just caught 
her off guard. I mean, she wasn’t even aware of your condition, so you couldn’t really blame 
her for being scared. Don’t you think it’s more dangerous that you didn’t tell her about 
it?”</p><p>Rei felt her heart skip a beat. She had never thought of it like that 
before.</p><p><i>She was trying to talk to me this morning, but I ran away. I thought that I 
was running away for her sake but maybe...it was for mine. </i></p><p><i>I like her. But 
she...</i></p><p>“Hey, Haruka...? Do you... think she’d ever talk to me again? It feels like 
I really messed things up this time.”</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t see why not. But first! I think 
it would be a really good conversation starter if you told her how you felt about 
her.”</p><p>“W-What?! But—I can’t do that!”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>Rei couldn’t stand that 
pointed expression the other woman was giving her. She knew Haruka was comfortable with 
herself, but she wasn’t Haruka.</p><p>“W-Well...what if she doesn’t like me 
back?”</p><p>Haruka could have sworn a mountain of bricks just fell on her. She was so close 
to slapping Rei upside the head.</p><p><i>You really are a piece of work, 
Rei!</i></p><p>“A-And why would you say that?” She brought herself to ask out of curiosity’s 
sake.</p><p>“...Because...she’s a naturally affectionate person. She’s nice to everyone... 
and she just lost her entire family not too long ago.” <i>She’s a Goddess now...</i> 
“Besides, there’s also that Venusian custom.”</p><p>“What custom?”</p><p>Rei pointed to her 
lips. “The one where you kiss your friends.”</p><p>“...On the lips?”</p><p>She 
nodded.</p><p>Haruka just stared at her like she was crazy. <i>I don’t know any Venusian 
custom like that! </i></p><p>“Did she tell you this? She didn’t k-k-kiss you did she?” She 
saw Rei turn away and blush like she were an embarrassed school-girl.</p><p><i>AND YOU 
BELIEVED HER?!?! </i></p><p>“Look. Do me,” <i>and everyone else, </i>“a favour and just do 
it.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“After today, you’re going to tell her how you feel, got it?!” Rei 
flinched back, and then coughed when Haruka suddenly slapped her across the back. 
“Ahhh...you know, I’m feeling pretty good!” She remarked as she stood up and 
stretched.</p><p>“Really...?” Rei eyed her suspiciously with teary eyes.</p><p>“Mhmm...I 
mean, don’t you also feel better to get all of that off your chest?”</p><p>Rei had to blink 
at that. <i>Now that I think about it...</i> Her heart did feel lighter.</p><p>“Umm, 
yeah...I guess...”</p><p>Haruka laughed. “You know, we still got some daylight left. You 
wanna train a bit more? I promise I’ll try to go easy on you,” she winked.</p><p>Rei jumped 
up and gave her a great big shove. “Pfft! You’re so full of yourself!”</p><p>“Haha! That’s 
more like it! C’mon! I’ll race you to the practice area!!”</p><p>As they ran around the 
palace, Rei couldn’t help but feel more hopeful about the future.</p><p><i>Maybe, she’s 
right. </i></p><p><i>...Maybe...I should just tell her how I feel.</i></p>
