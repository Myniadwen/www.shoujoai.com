<h1>I'll Protect You (part 11 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>&quot;Where to, Ms. Wendy?&quot; Asked Rei after she enter the driver&#39;s seat

&quot;Straight to the theatre, the concert director said that Minako will 
continue their rehearsal there&quot; Replied Wendy

Rei looked at the mirror and saw Minako winked at her. She just smiled, 
and started the car

As they reach the theatre the media started to approach Minako&#39;s car. 
Rei had a hard time slowing the car down especially when cameras were 
starting to flash madly. Minako is just waving her hand cutely

The Tokyo Police get themselves into action and shove the media off 
their path. The car continued to drive at the parking basement

The head chief is waiting for them at the basement entrance

&quot;Good morning big boss!&quot; Minako greeted

&quot;Good morning, Aino-san. I heard you were unable to continue your 
rehearsal yesterday due to fatigue. Are you feeling well already? Do you 
want to go to a doctor first?&quot; Asked the head chief

&quot;No need to, big boss! Thanks for the concern! I have a remedy for that 
and a lot of rest&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m glad to hear that from you Aino-san. Please proceed inside; the 
director is waiting for you&quot;

Minako nodded and proceeded inside together with Wendy. Rei remained in 
her position and looked at the head chief

The head chief looked back at her niece

&quot;Is there something you want to tell me, Hino?&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t reply first, she rounded her uncle and observed his face

&quot;By the look in your face I can surely tell that you&#39;re the one who 
wanted to tell me something big boss&quot; Rei said

The head chief sighed and nodded numbly. He waved his hand to the agents 
near them and he ordered them to follow and secure Minako inside. The 
pop star quickly noticed this

&quot;Hey, what&#39;s the meaning of this?&quot; the pop star protested as she saw the 
agents approach to her instead of her lover

She looked at Rei and expected to look at her direction, but she didn&#39;t

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot; She called

&quot;Go on without me. Big boss and I will discuss something important Ms. 
Aino&quot; Said Rei without looking at her pop star lover

Minako blew her cheeks as she pouted

&quot;I&#39;ll be following you inside, promise&quot;

&quot;Oh, alright, but if you didn&#39;t, I&#39;ll be mad at you&quot;

Then Minako and Wendy continued walking

&quot;You really do know me, do you?&quot; Asked the head chief

&quot;Oh come on, you are very obvious when it comes to serious situations so 
spill it&quot; Rei said as she crosses her arms and ready to listen

The head chief took a deep sigh

&quot;Yes, this is a serious situation and I hope this is only between you, 
me and the agents involved&quot;

&quot;Trust me, I&#39;m zipped&quot; Rei said

The head chief carefully picked the words to say then he straighten up

&quot;Rei, do you still remember the story that I told you about the group 
behind the murder of the international musician Marciano five years 
ago?&quot; Asked the head chief

&quot;Yeah, you even said that was the worst and most dreadful death of an 
international artist here in Japan. Seventy-eight people were killed 
including innocent audiences and police officers, right?&quot;

The head chief nodded

&quot;You are really lucky you weren&#39;t an agent that time. That was one of 
our worst nightmares in the history of TNPH&quot;

The head chief shrugged then continues

&quot;It was a shame that ninety outstanding police officers failed to save 
those people against only five individual men&quot;

&quot;Past is past uncle Namada. You and you fellow police all tried your 
best and risked your lives to protect those people right? Sanctuary is 
really known to be the famously hired assassins because of their skills 
and expertise in killing people. Especially the influential ones all 
over the world...&quot;

Rei paused. Influential ones?

She gasped and looked worriedly at the head chief who nodded

&quot;Big boss, do you mean&#151;&quot;

&quot;Yes. Last night two mysterious e-mails were sent to our main computer 
system. The first one has no sender name, and the other came from 
Sanctuary. And they both have the same contents, the other one was 
claimed by Sanctuary so I think they own both. Our computer Programmer 
tried to trace sender and where the mail came from but his laptop got 
infected with the &#39;Wing virus &#39;&quot;

&quot;So they have come back to mess with us again. They even got an expert 
hacker! So what did they say in the mail?&quot; Rei asked

The head chief pulled a folded paper out of his pocket and gave it to 
Rei who read it instantly

&quot;Big boss...This is a death threat&quot; Rei worriedly said

&quot;Yes, that is the second one, and we were having a great difficulty in 
understanding some of its contents. It&#39;s a Riddle&quot; Said the head chief

Rei read the paper again

From: The Men Known as Sanctuary

Subject: Party

We are here for nothing.

If you can read this ten times and clear

And realize you are who we seek

Better hush, stay beside your dear

Else you&#39;ll never see her again even a single peek

We seek no revenge nor start chaos purposely

Blame us not; you can seize this and spare one dear

If you seek answers recklessly

Her voice will be forgotten and death will be unclear

Venus is the goddess of love and beauty

Men unworthy doesn&#39;t deserve to lay even a single finger

Since no men for her is worthy

She instead seeks love from a mirror stranger

We do hope you understand this, because it&#39;s useless anyway.

There was silence between Rei and the head chief

&quot;We cannot understand the last part. They&#39;re really a pain in the head&quot; 
The head chief started

Rei is still silent while still looking at the poem

&quot;I know you&#39;re worried about Aino-san. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t sleep 
overnight just to at least figure out what Sanctuary is up to with this 
poem&quot;

&quot;Big boss&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Can I have this copy?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s yours. I&#39;ll just ask Jinbou for another copy. You want to solve it 
right?&quot; Asked the head chief

&quot;I...I guess so&quot; Replied Rei as she proceeded walking inside

&#39;Don&#39;t worry big boss. I&#39;ll figure this out myself. I know Sanctuary is 
referring to me this time&#39;

&quot;Ja ne big boss&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be here outside if you need us&quot; The head chief said

Rei refolded inserted the paper inside her pocket as she arrived at 
Wendy&#39;s side

&quot;Is there any serious problem, Ms. Hino?&quot; Wendy asked

The bodyguard watched Minako far away as the pop star listens to the 
concert director&#39;s instructions

&quot;Ms. Hino?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I&#39;m sorry Ms. Wendy. No, don&#39;t mind me it&#39;s my own problem&quot; Rei 
said

Wendy looked at her with disapproval

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I get a little nosy Ms. Hino. But Minako is now a part of 
you, and if she discovers that you are hiding something from her, even 
your personal problem, that will definitely upset her&quot;

Rei sighed

&quot;I know that Ms. Wendy. I really wish I could tell her, but I can&#39;t&quot;

Wendy still isn&#39;t convinced but she left the subject

&quot;Very well, I respect your decision because I think you know what you 
are doing&quot;

&quot;Thank you Ms. Wendy&quot; Rei said as she sits on the front seat far from 
Wendy&#39;s seat and started to read the paper she just kept

-----

Minako is listening to the concert director, and then she turned her 
head to search for her raven-haired lover. Found her. Rei felt Minako&#39;s 
gaze so she looked up to see the pop star waving her hand for her, she 
smiled and wave back to her and then went back to read the paper again

&#39;Good girl. Back as she promised&#39;

The concert director noticed Minako and made an &#39;Ahem&#39; noise

&quot;Ms. Aino, are you listening? Who are you waving at?&quot; Asked the concert 
director

&quot;Oh, sorry I&#39;m just waving to a fan of mine&quot;

&quot;Stop that waving first and listen to me. As I have said, I had changed 
the strategy to your grand entrance. Randy, Tamara, Hans, Jay and Kate 
will do the dance entrance from the main entrance through the audience 
hallway and then you-&quot;

The director pointed at a dancer at the back

&quot;You Derrick will be the first center of attraction in the stage. By now 
you should memorize your solo performance; your dance number will end 
when you see the blue&#151;no too dark, make it yellow smoke invading the 
stage&quot;

The dancer nodded determinedly on the director&#39;s instruction. The 
director now turned to the music director

&quot;You said you made a new remix version of Ms. Aino&#39;s song right? Keep 
that first, the producer suggested that we make use of the large T.V. 
screen there at the center stage; I have consulted a computer specialist 
to collect and edit the past concerts of Ms. Aino and put them all 
together to make a mini movie as part of the grand entrance and it 
should be finished by now. So make background music for it&quot; The director 
said

&quot;Can I at least see that movie first?&quot; Asked the music director with a 
little sarcasm on his voice

&quot;Oh right, right. I&#39;ll call him here so that both of you can talk about 
the music concept of the movie&quot;

&quot;The rest of the dancers, the choreographer already taught the dance 
steps for the grand entrance right? After that dance continue to the 
same routine that we did last concert. The signal of your appearance 
will be when Derrick joins the first five dancers that will gather at 
the middle part of the stage, okay?&quot;

All the dancers nodded. Then finally, the director turned to Minako

&quot;And now you Ms. Aino, the choreographer will teach you the new dance 
steps that they have practiced yesterday, then after the steps you have 
learned continue with the dance steps that you and the dancers always 
use. The order of the song to be played is still the same but you still 
have to condition your voice. The producer said that you should wear 
something white or red&quot;

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll tell that to my fashion designer tomorrow when they arrive&quot; 
Minako said

&quot;Okay, so let&#39;s get started so that we finish early saving time for 
resting!&quot; The director clapped his hands to signal the start of the 
rehearsal

Minako and her dancers took their positions as the choreographer climbs 
up the stage to start instructing the steps while the director sat down 
on his foldable chair to watch and observe their rehearsal

-----

Rei is silent at her seat, still reading the paper that the head chief 
gave to her

&quot;If you can read this ten times and clear, and realize you are who we 
seek... Better hush, stay beside your dear, else you&#39;ll never see her 
again even a single peek...&quot;

&#39;They are talking to me in this letter, I can feel it...but how did they 
know that Minako and I...well, I think it was very obvious if I ask 
myself&#39;

&quot;If you seek answers recklessly, her voice will be forgotten and death 
will be unclear...is this literally or...argh...big boss is right, 
they&#39;re really a pain in the head!&quot; Rei hissed at her seat

Rei looked at Minako for a little inspiration. Her grip on the paper 
tightened as she sees the happy face of Minako as she enjoys dancing 
there in the stage

&#39;Damn it Rei! You can&#39;t let Minako be hurt! Show that Sanctuary what 
you&#39;re made of or else you&#39;ll regret it!&#39; Thought Rei as she continued 
reading the poem

&quot;So this is the last part that big boss can&#39;t understand... Venus is the 
goddess of love and beauty, men unworthy doesn&#39;t deserve to lay even a 
single finger, since no men for her is worthy, she instead seeks love 
from a mirror stranger&quot;

Rei scratched her chin with her right index finger

&#39;So...are they still referring to us in this part? But something tells 
me that this last part is the solution to this stupid riddle...I have to 
read this over and over again even if it takes all day and night to 
figure this out&#39;

-----

-Far away from Rei&#39;s seat-

&quot;Look at your little agent Edward, I think she&#39;s getting a bit paranoid 
with Mark&#39;s riddle&quot; Said a mysterious voice

&quot;She&#39;ll definitely solve that by tomorrow Leonard. She&#39;s not just an 
ordinary cat, you know it&quot; Followed by another mysterious voice

&quot;Yeah, whatever. I&#39;ll made another virus for them, their system is 
awesome and I want to know how they do the virtual licensing system&quot;

&quot;Hmph. Do whatever you want to do. Just make sure you won&#39;t ruin our 
plan when they managed to trace you&quot;

&quot;Come on, don&#39;t you know who you are talking to? This Saturday they&#39;ll 
experience a party of a lifetime&quot;

&quot;...Party indeed&quot;</pre>
