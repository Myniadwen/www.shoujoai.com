<p>Rei was the first to wake up, and started on her morning chores. Two  hours later, she found that Makoto had woken up and began cooking.</p>
<p>“Ohaiyou Rei-chan! Breakfast?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, “After I wash up and change. Are the others awake yet?”</p>
<p>“Just  Ami. Usagi and Minako are still asleep, although Usagi is snoring  rather loudly. I can’t see how Minako is able to stay asleep through  that.”</p>
<p>Rei walked into her room to grab a change of clothes, and  found Ami trying to complete her assignments. She scanned the room and  saw that Usagi was indeed snoring, and Minako was asleep comfortably.  Rei smiled. <em>We must have stayed up pretty late, because I wouldn’t mind taking a little nap right now.</em></p>
<p>“Ami. Must you do assignments so early?” she whispered.</p>
<p>Ami looked up and nodded. “In case Usagi feels better, we might go somewhere!”</p>
<p>Rei just shook her head and headed towards the bathroom to change out of her miko outfit.</p>
<p><em>That’s better. </em>She thought, as she looked at herself in the mirror, pleased.</p>
<p>Suddenly,  she heard someone scream and rushed towards her room. She opened the  door and found that Usagi was awake, while Minako and Ami were laughing  hysterically. Makoto came flying in holding a pan as if it were a  weapon.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? I heard someone scream. Youma?”</p>
<p>“No. Just a tiny praying mantis that landed on Usagi’s nose,” replied Minako.</p>
<p>“It was going to attack me!” Usagi exclaimed, “Evil eyes. It has evil eyes!”</p>
<p>Makoto sighed. “Usagi. Why do I even bother?”</p>
<p>“It’s cute actually,” said Ami.</p>
<p>“Cute? Cute!? Little monster tried to eat my nose!”</p>
<p>“Usagi.  Not everything is out to get you. The window was just open and the  little guy happened to wander in. That’s all,” explained Rei.</p>
<p>“You really need to get some air conditioning Rei, rather than open your window.”</p>
<p>“Fresh air is always nice.”</p>
<p>“Well,  it seems like you’re feeling better Usagi. We should do something  today, since you missed out last night. But before that, breakfast on  the table,” said Makoto as she walked back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>As  soon as Usagi heard the word breakfast, she was at the kitchen before  everyone. Ami was still reading her book while eating her toast, and  Rei began scolding Usagi about table manners.</p>
<p>“Well Usagi. What do you want to do on a Saturday afternoon?” asked Minako.</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Crown Karaoke!”</p>
<p>“Not again. How about you enjoy the outdoors for once?” asked Rei.</p>
<p>“Not when insects are out to get you!”</p>
<p>“How about the park? Picnic?” suggested Ami.</p>
<p>“Oh! Will Mako-chan be making the food? Because I always love Mako-chan’s cooking!” exclaimed Usagi.</p>
<p>“Anything is better than karaoke,” sighed Rei.</p>
<p>Within  a few hours, Usagi enjoyed the feeling of soft grass against her back.  The weather was beautiful and no headaches were bothering her today.  She began to hum one of Minako’s songs and closed her eyes. This was  nice. A cool breeze brushed against her cheek and just when she was  about to drift to sleep some one yelled, “HEADS UP!”</p>
<p>Usagi didn’t  have enough time to react and a ball nearly landed on her face. She sat  up to look around and found Makoto and Rei looking rather guilty. She  shot them a glare as Minako and Ami were giggling.</p>
<p>Makoto and Rei ran towards Usagi and said,” Gomen. We didn’t mean it. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>Usagi  just glared at them as they slowly backed away. Just before her two  friends were on the clear, Usagi stood up and began chasing them.</p>
<p>“Usagi we already said we were sorry!” exclaimed Makoto as she hid behind a tree.</p>
<p>Rei  had already begun to climb up, and Usagi stood still and looked at both  her friends. It was a pretty funny picture seeing Rei grip on to the  tree’s branches for dear life, while Makoto tried desperately to hide  behind it. Usagi began to laugh hard and Rei and Makoto began to relax  and joined in.</p>
<p>All three girls went back to join Ami and Minako,  and Usagi headed straight for the food. “I love love love your cooking  Mako-chan! Arigato!” exclaimed Usagi as she started to fill her plate.  Ami even placed her book down to join in. However, Usagi began to feel  a slight throb in her head. Usagi frowned and rubbed her temples. <em>Oh, not again. It was even a perfect day! </em>she  thought Minako noticed this and started to keep a close watch on Usagi.  Rei must have noticed it too, because her worried eyes caught Minako’s  and they both nodded in agreement. Clouds began to form above the  girls, as it got darker.</p>
<p>As they started to pack up their things,  it began to rain. Usagi looked up and jumped in excitement while the  other girls sighed. “Great. A beautiful day ruined,” said Minako. Usagi  looked at them confused because she always loved it when it rained.</p>
<p>“What  are you talking about? It’s raining. That’s always the best part!” she  said as she splashed water at Rei’s face and began dancing in the rain.  All girls smiled and joined in the fun, running around and splashing  against the puddles like little kids again. They laughed reassuringly  when Ami slipped and fell on her butt. She blushed from embarrassment  and Makoto helped her up. Usagi turned around and looked at them. She  was happy to have friends like them. Despite some of their bickering,  it made life less dull. She knew that through thick and thin they would  her there by her side.</p>
<p>Before Usagi could say anything, a searing  pain shot through her brain. This was possibly the worst one Usagi  felt. She grabbed her head with both hands and screamed in agony.  Everyone suddenly ran to Usagi, who was on her knees at this point.</p>
<p>“Usagi?! Usagi-chan?! What’s wrong?” asked Ami.</p>
<p>“It  hurts so badly Ami-chan! Make it stop. Please!” exclaimed Usagi. She  was probably lying on the ground by now, because right before  everything drifted into darkness, she saw the four worried faces of her  friends.</p>
<p>“Call an ambulance. Quick!” exclaimed Minako as Rei pulled out her cell phone.</p>
<p>Makoto  carried Usagi to the nearby gazebo and Ami began checking her vitals.  Rei closed her phone, “They are on their way.” Minako looked at Usagi,  and understood the pain she was enduring right now. It hurt Minako to  see Usagi so helpless.</p>
