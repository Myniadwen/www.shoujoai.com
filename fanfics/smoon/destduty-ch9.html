<h1>Destiny or Duty (part 9 of 15)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/destduty-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Rei started at the sharp knock on the door, trying to ignore the sound, 
hoping that Yuuichirou or Grandpa would answer.  When the sound was 
repeated, she sighed and abandoned her prayers, standing up from the 
fire and shuffling over to the door.  Jerking it open, she stared at the 
visitor.  Usagi, tears in her blue eyes, caught the door before Rei 
could close it, holding out a damp and slightly crumpled paper.  The 
miko took it, her purple eyes widening.  &quot;Kami-sama,&quot; she breathed.  
&quot;Usagi, you got . . . Kami-sama.&quot;
 
&quot;I h-hope it&#39;s good enough, Rei.&quot;
 
&quot;Are you kidding?&quot;  Rei looked up, tears filling her eyes as she pulled 
Usagi into her arms.  &quot;This is more that I ever hoped . . .  I&#39;m sorry, 
Usagi, for being so harsh.&quot;
 
&quot;You were right, Rei,&quot; Usagi whispered, pulling back and resting her 
forehead on Rei&#39;s.  &quot;I really did need to try harder.  And it felt kinda 
good to get a passing grade for a change and to not be at the bottom of 
the list.&quot;
 
&quot;I promise I&#39;ll never do that again,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;I never wanted to 
yell at you.  Mamoru-kun said he found you by the lake in the park.&quot;
 
Usagi nodded as she followed Rei into her room and curled up on her bed.  
&quot;He explained to me that there were reasons that you pushed me away.  
It&#39;s because of him that I went to ask Ami-chan for help and she helped 
me study and get a better grade.&quot;
 
Rei smiled as she leaned against the wall and pulled the slender blonde 
into her lap, idly stroking her silky hair.  &quot;Tell me about this new 
friend of yours.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s wonderful, Rei; you&#39;d absolutely adore her!  And Mako-chan is a 
little more hot-headed, but she&#39;s very and nice and kinda lonely under 
that tough exterior.  We all study together now because Ami-chan can 
explain anything.  I wish you could be there, Rei.&quot;  Usagi&#39;s blue eyes 
sparkled hopefully, and Rei smiled.
 
&quot;I will be from now on.  Why don&#39;t I pick you up from school tomorrow 
and you can take me to meet these friends of yours?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, Rei!!&quot;  Usagi squealed in delight as she jumped into Rei&#39;s arms and 
kissed her cheek.  &quot;I missed you so much.&quot;
 
&quot;Not as much as I missed you.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;And she&#39;s coming here?!&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, Odango,&quot; Rei purred as Makoto and Ami read the paper.  &quot;Aino 
Minako is going to be doing a concert in just a week and guess who got 
four tickets?&quot;
 
If Usagi&#39;s eyes could get any bigger, they did, her voice failing for a 
moment.  The famous singer Aino Minako had been an obsession of Usagi&#39;s 
since the little blonde first heard about her, but she had been touring 
in England for quite a while.  The thought that she would see her idol 
so close . . . Usagi fell into Rei&#39;s arms, her lips brushing the miko&#39;s 
startled ones.  &quot;Thank you, Rei,&quot; she whispered.
 
&quot;Usagi-chan,&quot; Makoto began delicately, &quot;isn&#39;t it getting a little late?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh no!  I promised my parents I&#39;d be home early!  Bye, Ami-chan, 
Mako-chan, Rei!&quot;  Usagi grabbed her books and dashed out the door, a 
cloud of dust flaring up behind her once she reached the sidewalk.  That 
girl could run!
 
Rei chuckled, absently running her fingers over her lips.  She glanced 
up when Ami placed her small hand on the taller girl&#39;s arm.  &quot;Rei-chan, 
Usagi-chan must love you a great deal to try so hard and even get our 
help just so she could see you again.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know how she feels,&quot; Rei whispered, thinking back to the 
anomalies in her recent fire readings.  &quot;I think . . . I&#39;m pretty sure I 
love her, but there&#39;s something not quite right.  It&#39;s not something I 
can put my hand on, but this reality&#39;s been changed or twisted or 
something like that.  I don&#39;t think Usagi is meant to be mine.&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan!  Don&#39;t think like that!  We can never predict who the red 
strings of fate will bind us to or how, not even a miko like you.&quot;
 
&quot;I know, Mako-chan, but there&#39;s something very strange.&quot;  She looked out 
the window and smiled at her new friends as she stood to leave.  &quot;I need 
to go talk to someone.&quot;
 
Ami glanced at Makoto as the black-haired girl left.  &quot;I think she&#39;s 
right, Mako-chan.  I keep having this feeling that something is supposed 
to happen, something very important.  I don&#39;t know what it is, though.&quot;  
She reached her hand out and flicked her wrist, staring at her empty 
palm.  &quot;That seemed like the right thing to do.  I wonder what was 
supposed to happen.&quot;
 
&quot;I have no idea.&quot;
 
From the other side of the arcade, a tall woman with dark green hair 
watched the entire exchange.  &quot;Haruka, I hope this is what you wanted.&quot;  
Dropping a few bills on the counter to pay for her drink, Setsuna left, 
sighing.  That senshi was going to be the death of her yet.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Yes?  Rei-san?&quot;
 
&quot;Hello, Mamoru-kun.  I just wanted to thank you for helping with Usagi.&quot;
 
Mamoru smiled as he gestured for Rei to enter his apartment.  &quot;So I see 
that Usagi-san showed you her test.&quot;
 
&quot;You know about that?&quot;
 
&quot;As usual, she ran into me.  Is that the only reason you came?&quot;
 
&quot;No, not really.&quot;  Rei reached into her purse and pulled out a small 
envelope.  &quot;You know that Aino Minako is coming to Tokyo, right?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, I managed to get five tickets and I wondered if you wanted to 
come to her concert with me, Usagi, Mako-chan, and Ami-chan.&quot;
 
Mamoru smiled as he took the slip of paper.  &quot;I&#39;d love to.  Thank you.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Michiru?  Are you ready yet?&quot;
 
&quot;No, Haruka.  I have this last scene I want to paint.  Go on without me 
and I&#39;ll be at the racetrack in time to congratulate the winner.&quot;  
Michiru grinned, knowing that her choice of words would agitate the 
blonde.  Haruka snorted and leaned over Michiru&#39;s painting, smiling at 
the sea-side scene.
 
&quot;Well, you had better be ready to make this up to me.  I like to have my 
support.&quot;
 
&quot;I will,&quot; Michiru promised, her voice a half-purr.  She reached up with 
her paint brush and dabbed a spot of blue on Haruka&#39;s nose, laughing at 
the blonde&#39;s cry of outrage.
 
&quot;Do you mind?!&quot;  Haruka grabbed the nearest paper towel and furiously 
wiped at the end of her nose, eyes crossed as she tried to see if she 
got it all.  Michiru laughed and took the paper towel, wetting it at the 
sink before gently cleaning the last of the blue paint off of her 
lover&#39;s nose.  Leaning closer, she kissed the racer gently, pushing her 
towards the door.
 
&quot;Go win for me,&quot; she whispered, returning to her painting.  Haruka 
walked away, a chill running down her spine as she left her sea siren 
alone.  She had a very bad feeling, and nothing would chase it away.  
She turned back, intent on staying and protecting her lover, but she 
knew that her girlfriend would never allow that.  Sighing, knowing that 
she would regret the decision later, Haruka left for her race.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Michiru hummed to herself as she walked down the empty sidewalk, 
sketchpad clutched close to her chest.  She felt strange, a chill 
enveloping her form, as she passed still alley after still alley.  The 
darkness frightened her in a way it shouldn&#39;t, a dread coming over her 
as she approached a particularly still area.  She stopped still as a 
small group of teenage boys dressed in strange clothes exited from the 
dark alley, grinning when they saw that she was alone.
 
&quot;Give us your money,&quot; the leader growled, holding out his hand as his 
three followers surrounded the woman.  Michiru shook her head, knowing 
that she had to fight; some old, deep instinct primed her instantly for 
battle as she couched into a defensive stance, dropping her book.  The 
man moved and she countered instantly, her instincts, speed, and 
reflexes surprising even her.  She knew, deep inside, that she should be 
able to fight five human men, but she lacked the strength and skill to 
augment her natural abilities.  They were able to team up and defeat 
her, three of them pinning her against the wall in the small alley as 
the leader crossed his arms over his chest and considered the struggling 
girl.
 
&quot;What should we do with her now, boss?  She doesn&#39;t have any money.&quot;
 
&quot;She&#39;s got something a lot better,&quot; the leader growled, leaning forward 
and running his fingers over the woman&#39;s cheek.  Michiru froze, eyes 
wide, as the man grinned again.  &quot;Yeah, a lot better.&quot;</pre>
