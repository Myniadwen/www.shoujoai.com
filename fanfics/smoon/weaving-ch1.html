<h1>A Weaving of Lights</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mtreiber.html">Michael Treiber</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Setsuna frowned in concentration. &#145;Wait for it&#133;&#146; she thought to 
herself, her trigger finger tense, &#145;Wai&#133; NOW!&#146; With a grunt for 
effect, she depressed the firing toggle&#133; a bare second to late. The 
shimmering silver sphere of death rolled past the spent defenses, 
crushing her last chance for victory. The shame of defeat was such a 
great weight on her shoulders, she couldn&#146;t even hold her head up.

&#147;Wow&#133;&#148; Ami whispered to Makoto, &#147;I&#146;ve never seen anyone get so intense 
over pinball before.&#148;

&#147;Who would have thought that Setsuna was a pin ball wizard?&#148; Makoto 
replied to her girlfriend.

&#147;I&#39;ve had a lot of practice&#133; for a long couple of years this was the 
only entertainment around.&#148; Apparently the senshi of time had heard 
them. Before either could reply, however, someone none of them would 
have thought to see in the crown game center walked in.

Minako&#146;s mother.

Setsuna was the first to react to her.

&#147;Um&#133; hello, Mrs. Aino. Can I&#133; help you?&#148;

Katori just smiled.

&#147;Oh, I&#146;m just looking for Minako and Rei. I&#146;m going shopping, and I 
thought Id invite them along. Ah&#133; here they are.&#148;

Minako had noticed her mother and Setsuna chatting and decided to find 
out what was going on.

&#147;Hi mom! ...Something the matter?&#148;

&#147;No, I just thought I&#146;d see if you and Rei wanted to go shopping with 
me.&#148;

Smiling brightly, Minako nodded.

&#147;I&#146;ll go get Rei.&#148;

Katori smiled brightly at Setsuna. &#147;She seems so much happier since 
she started dating Rei. I was kind of leery at first&#133; but the two of 
them make a good pair.&#148;

It took Setsuna several minutes to formulate a reply.

&#147;Dating? Excused me?&#148;

It was a measure of how shocked she was that she didn&#146;t manage to 
think of a reply until the three had been gone for several minutes.

&#147;Setsuna&#133; dinner time!&#148; Haruka stuck her head into Setsuna&#146;s workroom 
to see the tall woman putting the last touches on a new work of art.

The senshi of time looked up from finishing the last line of stitches 
with a smile on her face.

&#147;Ah! Haruka! Just the person I was hopping to see&#133; come here, would 
you?&#148;

Though she frowned a bit, Haruka came into the sewing room. Setsuna 
stood, holding her newest dress against Haruka&#146;s side.

It was an elegant, flowing gown of palest blue, with a high cut 
neckline and a slit running the length of the skirt, across what would 
be the outside of the right thigh of whoever wore it.

&#147;Perfect&#133;&#148; Setsuna muttered, gazing up and down at the dress pressed 
against Haruka.

&#147;No.&#148;

Blinking in confusion before she replied, Setsuna&#146;s voice held a 
slight edged when she asked,

&#147;No? What do you mean, &#145;No&#146;?&#148;

&#147;Exactly what I said. No! I&#146;m not wearing that&#133; that&#133; dress!&#148;

Setsuna cast her eyes down.

&#147;But Haruka&#133; you&#39;re the only one who can model it. Its perfect for 
you&#133; just look at these long, elegant lines! A tall, slender, athletic 
woman like you would make this dress shine!&#148;

&#147;No means no. Now come on&#133; dinner&#146;s going to get cold.&#148;

Sighing deeply, Setsuna carefully hung the dress up and followed 
Haruka out of her workroom. As they were walking down the hall, 
Setsuna asked &#150;in a carefully neutral voice-

&#147;Haruka? Did you know Minako and Rei were dating?&#148;

&#147;Right&#133; sure they are.&#148;

A sudden idea struck Setsuna.

&#147;Um&#133; you don&#146;t really believe me that Minako and Rei are an item?&#148;

Haruka sighed.

&#147;I&#146;m not saying you&#39;re lying&#133; I just think that you might want to 
check the source of your information.&#148;

&#147;Willing to make a bet on it?&#148;

Haruka stopped and turned to Setsuna.

&#147;What kind of bet?&#148;

The time senshi smiled.

&#147;Tell you what&#133; I prove that Minako and Rei are dating, you model the 
dress. You prove me wrong, and you can name your price.&#148;

There was no doubt in Setsuna&#146;s mind that she had this one in the bag. 
After all, she already had confirmation of her victory, straight from 
Minako&#146;s mother&#146;s mouth.

&#147;Well&#133; if you&#39;re sure&#133; Deal. You win, I model your dress. I win, and 
you make some lingerie for me to give Michiru for her birthday&#133; 
something sexy&#133; silk, I think.&#148;

Setsuna just smiled.

&#147;Deal.&#148;

&#145;Wait a minute&#133; she agreed to that way to quickly&#133;&#146; Haruka thought to 
herself. But it was too late&#133; the deal was set.

Setsuna took meticulous care in preparing the ambush. Warm lighting to 
promote a trusting atmosphere&#133; soft background music to relax a pair 
of troubled souls&#133; It was flawless. She would invite Minako and Rei 
over for tea &#150;a warm herb tea, heavily laced with cream and honey to 
further relax the two-, and over the course of the afternoon bring up 
the topic of their relationship. If she could get them to &#145;come out&#146; 
to her, then they should have no problem telling everyone else.

It was a foolproof plan.

The ringing of the door shattered her mental backslapping.

&#147;Ah, Minako, Rei, good to see you!&#148;

Setsuna opened the door and let the two young women in.

&#147;Where&#146;s everyone else?&#148; Minako asked.

&#147;Oh, um&#133; no one else could make it. Ami and Makoto had plans together, 
and Haruka took Michiru and Hotaru out to lunch.&#148;

Rei shrugged. Then she seemed to notice something in the air.

&#147;Mmm&#133; what&#146;s that smell?&#148;

A super human effort was exerted by Setsuna to restrain the predatory 
grin that threatened to splash across her face.

&#147;Oh, just some incense I like to burn now and again&#133; do you like it?&#148;

Minako was the one to answer.

&#147;Its pretty&#133; makes me just a bit drowsy, though&#133;&#148;

Setsuna held her silence, leading the other two into the living room.

&#147;So&#133;&#148; Setsuna said casually, taking a small piece of spice cake &#150;a 
proven comfort food- off the plate next to the tea. &#147;You two have been 
spending a lot of time together.&#148;

Minako&#146;s blush was as good as a signed confession. Rei, however, was a 
bit more composed.

&#147;Well&#133;&#148; she started, &#147;With Ami and Makoto paired up, and the Usagi 
Mamoru thing getting more serious, its not like we exactly have a lot 
of choices.&#148;

Nodding, Setsuna let sympathy poor into her voice.

&#147;Yes&#133; everyone is pairing up&#133; Haruka and Michiru&#133; Ami and Makoto&#133; But 
what about you two?&#148;

When Rei&#146;s faced went stony, and Minako cast her eyes down, Setsuna 
knew that she had pushed too far, to fast. She had to do something to 
pull the situation back to a point where she could control it. &#147;Oh 
dear&#133; this tea seems to have gone to me&#133; Will you girls please excuse 
me for a moment so I can go freshen up a bit?&#148;

Not waiting for them to respond, Setsuna hurried from the room, 
closing the door behind her. She listened at the door, waiting for a 
sign that the pressure was off enough for her to reenter the room. 
What she heard was like music to her mind.

&#147;Rei&#133;&#148; Minako began slowly, &#147;Maybe we should tell Setsuna. She could 
probably give us some advice on some of this.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not sure that&#146;s such a good idea Minako&#133;&#148;

Seeing the expression on her friend&#146;s face, Rei continued in a softer 
tone of voice.

&#147;But we are partners in this&#133; if you want to tell her, we can.&#148;

&#145;Perfect!&#146; Setsuna thought to herself, opening the door to the living 
room and rejoining the other two girls. They immediately went quiet 
when she walked in. Evidence enough in and of itself.

&#147;Sorry I took so long&#133;&#148; Setsuna smiled, &#147;So&#133; what were we talking 
about again?&#148;

Rei nodded to Minako.

&#147;Actually&#133;&#148; The small blonde said in a quiet voice. &#147;There was 
something that&#133;&#148; she trailed off, her voice going quiet.

Taking a deep breath, Rei picked up where her friend had left off.

&#147;It&#146;s like this&#133; both of our parents think we&#146;re dating.&#148;

Setsuna&#146;s heart quickened. &#145;This is it&#133; Haruka&#146;s as good as mine!&#146;

&#147;But actually&#133; it&#146;s all just a sham to get them off the idea of us 
dating the sons of friends.&#148;

Her earlier joy crumbling, Setsuna asked,

&#147;So&#133; you two are just pretending to have a relationship?&#148;

Nodding, Minako quietly agreed.

&#147;Yeah&#133; it&#146;s all just make believe&#133;&#148;

&#147;So&#133; You don&#146;t feel anything for each other?&#148;

Rei shook her head.

&#147;Nothing at all. We&#146;re just friends.&#148;

Out of the corner of her eye, Setsuna noticed that Minako cast her 
gaze aside when Rei denied any romance between the two.

&#147;And we might need some help now and again, reinforcing the fa&ccedil;ade. 
That&#146;s why we told you&#133; we trust you, Setsuna.&#148; Rei continued.

The tall senshi of time took another sip of tea, stretching out a 
long, quiet moment before answering.

&#147;Well now&#133; that&#146;s a lot of trust you&#39;re placing on my shoulders&#133; but 
I&#146;ll do my best.&#148;

Rei stood before replying.

&#147;Thank Setsuna&#133;now, if you&#146;ll excuse me, I have duties at the shrine.&#148;

Minako remained quiet while Rei left. She was taking care not to look 
at either Setsuna or the other girl until she left.

&#147;Well&#133;&#148; Setsuna smiled, &#147;Just us now, eh Minako?&#148;

&#147;Mmhmm&#133; suppose so&#133;&#148;

&#147;Minako&#133; what&#146;s wrong? Something you want to talk about?&#148;

Taking a slow sip of her tea, the blonde took a moment to respond.

&#147;Suppose&#133; just suppose&#133; that someone was pretty lonely. Now, they&#146;re a 
happy, popular person, so no one suspects. Then suppose, remember, 
still just pretending, suppose something came along that let them 
pretend, for just a moment, that they weren&#146;t alone. How do you think 
that person would feel having the fact it was just an illusion just 
casually brought up?&#148;

&#147;Oh my&#133;&#148; Setsuna breathed, &#147;You&#146;re&#133; in love with her, aren&#146;t you?&#148;

Minako couldn&#146;t answer for a long moment.

&#147;I don&#146;t know&#133; and she&#146;s not exactly giving me the chance to find out. 
Not that I can blame her&#133; the thought&#146;s probably never even crossed 
her mind. She&#146;s never shown the slightest interest in other girls&#133;

Gently interrupting, Setsuna said,

&#147;Neither have you Minako.&#148;

&#147;I know!&#148; Minako sighed deeply. &#147;This is killing me. I want to tell 
her &#145;Hey, even though this is just a charade, I&#39;ve never been 
happier!&#146; &#133;but, &#133; I&#146;m afraid that she&#146;ll&#133; you know&#133;&#148;

Setsuna nodded.

&#147;Yeah&#133; I know. But there is a simple solution to all of this&#133;&#148;

Minako&#146;s eyes glowed with hope.

&#147;Anything&#133; anything you can tell me that&#146;ll help&#133;&#148;

&#147;Seduce her.&#148;

&#147;E&#133;Excuse me?&#148; Minako was shocked. &#147;What did you just say?&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s simple.&#148; Setsuna slowly explained. &#147;You&#146;re in love with her, but 
she doesn&#146;t think about girls that way. So you have to get her to 
think about nothing but that. Infect her with the idea of &#145;gee&#133; I 
wonder what it&#146;d be like?&#146; until she burns with curiosity. She&#146;s not 
exactly a loose girl, so I&#146;m almost sure she&#146;s a virgin&#133; she probably 
thinks about sex all the time anyway&#133;&#148;

Setsuna trailed off when she saw how stunned Minako looked.

&#147;Don&#146;t worry&#133; well take it slow&#133;&#148;

Three days later Setsuna bumped into Rei for the first time since the 
little get together. The time goddess was at a pharmacy, picking up 
some medicine for a cold of Haruka&#146;s when she saw the flame lady.

&#147;Oh, hello Rei.&#148;

Rei paused in the middle of placing a bottle of over the counter 
painkillers in her basket when she heard Setsuna&#146;s voice.

&#147;Hello Setsuna.&#148;

The taller woman raised an inquiring eye at the pain medication. It 
was the strongest that could be sold without a prescription.

&#147;Problems?&#148;

&#147;Huh? Oh&#133; nothing serious&#133; just a bit of tendonitis that seems to be 
creeping up on me from trying to type up all these collage essays.&#148;

&#147;Well, I hope you feel better.&#148; Setsuna said with a gentle smile. She 
had her first hook.

&#147;Um&#133; why exactly am I here?&#148; Minako asked, a bit confused. Setsuna had 
called and told her to come over immediately, saying only that it had 
to do with their &#145;project&#146;.

&#147;I&#146;m going to give you your first lesson in the art of seduction: 
finding perfectly innocent ways to touch your intended vic&#133; er, 
partner.&#148;

Minkao&#146;s heart was pounding. True, this was what she wanted&#133; well, she 
thought so anyway, but to actually start taking steps forward in a 
plan to seduce her best friend?

Setsuna&#146;s softly spoken command cut through her internal battle over 
the ethics of her decision.

&#147;Sit down on the couch, and take off your shirt.&#148;

&#147;What! I though you were going to show me some &#145;perfectly innocent 
ways&#146; to touch Rei&#133; I don&#146;t call stripping perfectly innocent!&#148;

The garnet eyed woman sighed deeply.

&#147;Rei suffers from tendonitis. I&#146;m going to show you a massage 
technique that you can do for her that will ease the pain, but it 
doesn&#146;t work through clothing, and I need full access to your 
forearms.&#148;

Though hesitant, Minako slowly removed her shirt and sat on the couch 
where Setsuna directed.

Following the younger blonde, Setsuna spoke slowly, in soft tones in 
an effort to calm the obviously nervous girl.

&#147;This shouldn&#146;t be to hard for you to pull off&#133; all you have to do is 
notice Rei rubbing her wrist or the like, and mention that you used to 
suffer from tendonitis. She&#146;ll bring hers up, and you can tell her 
about a technique one of the girls on your volleyball team showed you. 
After she takes off her shirt, move very slowly, no sudden moves that 
might scare her.&#148;

Setsuna followed her own advice by moving slowly to join Minako on the 
couch. Taking the other girls hand, she looked her in the eye as she 
continued.

&#147;Now that you have her where you want her, keep moving slowly. You 
don&#146;t want her to bolt.&#148;

Minako&#146;s hand was warm and soft beneath her touch. Exerting gentle 
pressure, she began rubbing circles into the joint between the thumb 
and wrist.

&#147;You start here, where the thumb and wrist meet. From there, you 
slowly work your way along each finger, returning to the thumb/wrist 
joint before moving on.&#148;

As good as her, word, Setsuna worked Minako&#146;s hands for several 
moments in silence. By now, the golden haired beauty had closed her 
eyes, relaxing into the touch.

&#147;From there, move on to the wrist.&#148; Setsuna began lightly brushing her 
fingers over Minako&#146;s wrist, just the barest whisper of fingertips 
running softly over the sensitive skin.

&#147;Remember&#133; the skin here is very sensitive. A light brush of the 
fingertips can be extremely pleasant. Alternate fingertip caresses 
with deeper massage strokes.&#148;

Minako&#146;s breath had quickened. She almost moaned as she replied.

&#147;Mmm&#133; yeah&#133;. It, it is kind of nice&#133;&#148;

Lowering her voice even further, Setsuna almost whispered as she 
continued.

&#147;Please turn to your left&#133;&#148;

As Minako turned so that she was almost parallel to the couch, Setsuna 
slowly brought her left leg up, around the other girl. Letting her 
hands continue as they were, she gently moved Minako until her legs 
were straddling Minako&#146;s, and the smaller girls back was braced 
against her chest.

Still not stopping the massage, she placed her lips bare inches from 
Minako&#146;s ear, and whispered.

&#147;Now comes the tough part&#133; changing arms. You have to work both of 
them, but the first part of the massage isn&#146;t quite as&#133; interesting as 
what&#146;s going on now. That&#146;s why you have to move Rei around like this, 
so that you&#146;re nearly embracing her. It&#146;ll provide a bit of 
distraction while you build up momentum in the other arm.&#148;

She brought Minako&#146;s left arm over, across her stomach. Setsuna now 
had her arms wrapped completely around Minako, with her chin on the 
other girl&#146;s shoulder and her right cheek pressed against Minako&#146;s 
left. Once again, she started working slow circles in the 
thumb/forefinger joint.

&#147;See? If you move slow enough, and do each step properly, you can work 
Rei into a position like this&#133; But if you just moved straight into 
having your arms wrapped around her like this, she&#146;d go all cold and 
stiff&#133; maybe even start freaking out on you.&#148;

&#147;Oh&#133;.mmm&#133;. I see&#133;&#148;

Hearing how inarticulate Minako was becoming, Setsuna realized that it 
was time to back off. Releasing the other girls arm, she gave a final 
piece of advice.

&#147;And here&#146;s the most important step&#133; make a grand finale.&#148;

With her arms still wrapped around Minako, she placed her lips against 
Minako&#146;s ear.

&#147;I hope you feel better now Rei&#133;&#148; she whispered softly.

The feel of Setsuna&#146;s warm, soft breath in her ear made Minako want to 
start purring. And then Setsuna placed a gentle kiss against her 
cheek.

&#147;And then you make your exit, to let Rei sit and think about what just 
happened.&#148;

As good as her word, Setsuna stood and left, leaving Minako to sit for 
several minutes to regain her composure before she left&#133; for Rei&#146;s 
house.

Rei&#146;s brain seemed to be slowly sinking into a thick, warm pool. She&#146;d 
been a bit surprised when Minako had come over so suddenly, especially 
since the other girl knew that she was finishing up another essay.

It was even more confusing when Minako had stared at her rubbing her 
wrist for several long moments, before offering to show her something 
she had learned from a fellow volley ball player.

Now, if that was confusing, then what was the word for when your best 
female friend had her arms wrapped around you, and was rubbing you in 
a way that&#133; well&#133; confusion just didn&#146;t seem to cover it.

&#145;This is nice&#133;&#146; Rei though, the words slowly bubbling up out of the 
thick molasses that seemed to have filled her skull, &#145;Maybe&#133; to nice?&#146; 
Just as she was about to say something however, Minako abruptly 
stopped.

Hugging her tightly, she whispered into Rei&#146;s ear.

&#147;Oh Rei&#133; I&#146;m so sorry, but I promised to have lunch with my mother 
today&#133; I have to go.&#148;

Still wrapped in Minako&#146;s arms, Rei made a noise of general consent, 
not feeling capable of much more.

* * *

&#147;Yes?&#148; Setsuna answered the door, surprised by who was waiting outside 
for her. &#147;Oh&#133; hello Rei&#133; come in.&#148;

Rei stepped into the outer senshi mansion almost hesitantly. She 
wasn&#146;t really sure if this was the right thing to be doing, but&#133; she 
had to do something.

The raven-haired young woman followed her hostess into the living 
room, where the two took places on the couch.

&#147;So&#133; was there something I could do for you, or is this just a social 
call?&#148;

A frown crossed Rei&#146;s face for a moment before she answered.

&#147;It&#133; well, it&#146;s kind of about Minako.&#148;

Setsuna just nodded for her to continue.

&#147;She&#146;s been acting weird around me for the last couple of days. Then, 
yesterday&#133;&#148; A blush lit her face in crimson fire. &#147;Well, maybe I 
misunderstood, but I think she&#133;&#148;

&#147;You think she&#133;?&#148; Setsuna tried to drag the confession out of Rei. She 
knew very well what Minako had tried yesterday.

&#147;I think she may be misunderstanding our relationship. She&#146;s my best 
friend, but I&#146;m not&#133;&#148;

Still pretending confusion, Setsuna just blinked at Rei as if she had 
no idea what she was talking about. Though embarrassed beyond belief, 
Rei managed to choke a final exclamation out.

&#147;I think she tried to seduce me!&#148;

&#147;Oh&#133;&#148; Setsuna said slowly, &#147;Did it work?&#148;

&#147;WHAT!? Are you serious?&#148;

&#147;Well, Minako&#146;s a lovely young woman. And its not like you&#39;re involved 
with anyone else right now. What&#146;s the big deal?&#148;

Rei was almost sputtering in disbelief now.

&#147;She&#146;s a girl, and I&#146;m not a lesbian! I just don&#146;t&#133; think about her 
like that!&#148;

&#147;Mm&#133; that is a problem then, isn&#146;t it.&#148;

&#147;Yeah&#133; you could say that.&#148;

Setsuna shrugged.

&#147;So what do you want me to do?&#148;

&#147;Give me some advice! How the hell am I supposed to deal with this!?&#148;

&#147;First thing, calm down. Now, your problem with this whole thing is 
that you think Minako is attracted to you, and its wierding you out. I 
assume that you&#146;d rather not hurt her feelings, but you don&#146;t want to 
be uncomfortable around your best friend.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s right&#133;&#148; Rei responded slowly.

&#147;All right. I&#146;ll think about it&#133; for now, just play cool. If Minako 
makes anymore moves on you, just play along until you start to get to 
uncomfortable, and then GENTLY break away. Don&#146;t do anything rash&#133; you 
could hurt her very badly. Just&#133; be gentle. A first love is a delicate 
thing, and if Minako&#146;s gotten bold enough to actually make physical 
advances toward you, she&#146;s probably head over heals for you. If you 
freak out and push her away, you might wound her heart in a way that 
would stick with her forever.&#148;

As soon as Rei left, Setsuna was at the phone.

&#147;Minako? It&#146;s Setsuna&#133; do you have plans tomorrow?&#148;

&#147;Michiru? Can I come in?&#148; Setsuna stood outside the artist&#146;s bedroom 
door, awaiting her invitation.

&#147;Oh course Setsuna. Something I can do for you?&#148;

&#147;Actually, I have a&#133; personal question.&#148;

&#147;Alright&#133;&#148;

&#147;You were with a couple of men before you met Haruka, weren&#146;t you?&#148;

Michiru was stunned. What was Setsuna thinking?

&#147;I.. Well, yes&#133;&#148;

&#147;Um&#133; how&#133; how different is it to kiss a gir&#133; to kiss Haruka than it is 
to kiss a guy?&#148;

Deciding to answer, Michiru replied,

&#147;Well, a little different. I mean, I suppose in one sense, lips are 
lips. But the big difference is hard to explain. Kissing a girl is&#133; 
softer. It can be just as passionate, just as hungry, but in general, 
kissing a girl is a much more&#133; intimate experience than kissing a 
boy.&#148;

&#147;How&#133; what do you mean?&#148;

&#147;Women are more&#133; open with their emotions, for the most part. Even if 
their face doesn&#146;t tell you, their lips always manage to say &#145;I love 
you&#146;. That&#146;s not to say men can&#146;t do that, its just that&#133; well, it&#146;s 
hard to explain&#133;&#148;

Setsuna shook her head.

&#147;No, no&#133; thank you. That helps&#133; a little&#133;&#148;

&#147;Well&#133;&#148; Michiru said to the empty air after Setsuna had left. &#147;That 
was odd&#133;&#148;

It was with a decided feeling of dread that Rei stepped up to Minako&#146;s 
bedroom door. The small blonde had called her, practically in tears, 
and begged her to come over. There was no way that this could be good.

She told herself to shut up, and knocked.

&#147;Come in&#133;&#148;

Minako was sitting on the edge of her bed, her face red and tear 
streaked.

&#147;Oh Minako&#133; what&#146;s wrong? Are you ok?&#148; Rei sat on the bed next to her 
friend, concern washing away her earlier apprehension.

&#147;You know how my mom said that she was going away on a business trip, 
and that we could use the house while she was gone?&#148;

Rei nodded, blushing slightly. It had been clear what Katori thought 
they were going to use the house for.

&#147;She lied. She&#146;s going to the hospital for three days. She&#133;&#148; Minako 
couldn&#146;t even finish before bursting into tears again. Rei wrapped her 
arms around the weeping woman, and gently stroked her hair.

&#147;Shh&#133; I&#146;m sure she&#146;s going to be ok Mina&#133;&#148;

Minako sniffled. &#147;You&#146;ve never called me that before.&#148;

&#147;What? Oh&#133; calling you Mina&#133;sorry&#133;&#148;

Tilting her head up within Rei&#146;s embrace, Minako smiled brightly.

&#147;No&#133; I like it. It isn&#146;t as formal as you always calling me Minako&#133; It 
makes us seem closer.&#148;

Setsuna&#146;s words echoed in Rei&#146;s mind.

&#145;Be gentle&#133; don&#146;t do anything rash&#133; you could hurt her&#133;&#146; Before Rei 
could say anything, however, Minako pulled away. So, rather than 
continue down that rather uncomfortable thread of conversation, Rei 
changed the subject.

&#147;So&#133; why&#146;s your mother going to the hospital?&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s another reason I wanted you to come over. She &#150;my mother- is 
having a cyst removed from her breast. It&#146;s benign, and pretty small, 
but still&#133; It got me thinking. How would I know if I had&#133; cancer or 
something? That kind of thing runs in families&#133;&#148;

&#147;Uh&#133; Minako? Cysts are pretty common, and not really anything to worry 
about. But since you are worried, just do a &#145;self exam&#146;.&#148;

Minako chewed her lip and lowered her gaze in the way Rei knew meant 
she was about to ask something uncomfortable.

&#147;I&#133; don&#146;t really know how.&#148;

Rei opened her mouth to speak, but was interrupted by the ringing of 
the phone. Minako walked into the kitchen to answer, while Rei sat on 
the bed and tried to think of someway to get out of what she knew was 
coming next. Minako stepped into the room, still holding the phone 
receiver.

&#147;Rei? It&#146;s my mom&#133; do you think you could come back tomorrow and&#133; 
finish this with me?&#148;

Sighing deeply as she stood up, Rei answered in a nearly toneless 
voice.

&#147;Sure Minako&#133; tomorrow afternoon.&#148;

* * *

Rei paced about her bedroom for a few minutes before the weight of 
inevitability came crashing down on her.

&#147;I can&#146;t deal with this on my own&#133; I better call Setsuna&#133;&#148;

The phone rang a few times before someone answered.

&#147;Hello?&#148;

&#147;Hi Setsuna&#133; this is Rei. Um&#133; Minako and I&#133; well&#133; could I come over? I 
have another one of those things I need to discuss with you&#133;&#148;

The other end of the line was silent for a long moment before Setsuna 
answered.

&#147;Yeah&#133; come on over. I know what to do about this Minako thing.&#148;

A short hour later, Rei was standing outside of the outer senshi&#146;s 
house. A knock on the door inspired an immediate invitation inside. 
Rei entered, and closed the door behind herself.

&#147;I&#146;m in my bedroom Rei&#133; come on in&#133;&#148;

&#145;What the hell is going on here?&#146; Rei thought to herself. As soon as 
she had entered the house, something seemed wrong. It was quiet for 
one thing&#133; far too quiet. But, regardless, she entered Setsuna&#146;s 
bedroom.

The older woman reached around her, closing &#150; and locking- the door.

&#147;Setsuna, what&#133;?&#148;

The garnet eyed woman, her arm still around Rei where she had reached 
around to the doorknob, smiled and leaned a bit closer.

&#147;I know exactly how to deal with this thing with Minako&#133;&#148; She 
whispered, just before she leaned a bit further forward and began 
passionately kissing Rei.
