<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 10 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>        Usagi shifted in her bed, long golden hair spread out on the 
pillows. She didn&#39;t know what it was that woke her, but the most 
wonderful smell filled the air. The slim girl looked around her 
blearily, seeing the black cat sleeping soundly on the end of the 
bed.

        &#39;Someone is cooking something nice,&#39; Usagi blinked, 
carefully sliding out of bed and trying not to wake up the cat. &#39;And 
it can&#39;t be Luna. So that just leaves my new roommate,&#39; she thought. 
Making sure that her pajamas were reasonably neat and rubbing the 
sleep out of her eyes she shuffled down the stairs.

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Makoto Kino smiled, standing in front of the 
kitchen stove. The tall brown haired woman wore the traditional 
school girl&#39;s uniform, with a cheerful apron thrown over it, and she 
seemed quite happy amid the boiling pots and frying foods.

        &quot;Good morning,&quot; Usagi managed, sitting at the kitchen table.

        Makoto gave her a sympathetic glance, noting that she was 
apparently not a morning person. She poured some tea, setting it 
down in front of Usagi, &quot;We need to do some shopping after school, 
too. I&#39;ve done my best with the leftovers in the fridge, but..&quot;

        &quot;Oh, right,&quot; Usagi blushed slightly, drinking down some of 
the tea. &quot;I haven&#39;t been cooking much lately,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;mostly just getting takeout.&quot;

        &quot;I wanted to say thank you, for letting me live here,&quot; 
Makoto said quietly, dishing up the food for both her and Usagi. She 
sat down at the table while giving Usagi a bit of room, &quot;Rei told me 
about what happened to your family.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Usagi ate the food happily, bur oddly her eyes 
glistened with unshed tears. &quot;I haven&#39;t eaten like this,&quot; she said 
softly, &quot;since my mother..&quot;

        &quot;Usagi?&quot; Luna&#39;s questioning voice came from upstairs, and in 
a few moments the little black cat bounded down the stairs.

        &quot;I made something for you as well,&quot; Makoto got up, grabbing 
a bowl from nearby the fridge. She turned, &quot;Do you want this on the 
floor or at the table?&quot;

        &quot;Uh, the table please,&quot; Luna managed. Makoto sat the dish 
down there, and Luna jumped up beside the bowl. She sniffed it, 
sampled a bit of the food, the cat&#39;s eyes widened slightly in 
surprise, then she dug in quite happily.

        &quot;I know I should have asked before using your kitchen,&quot; 
Makoto said softly, &quot;but you looked like you could use a good meal.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Usagi reassured her. She smiled, &quot;You can 
cook anytime you want.&quot;

        &quot;Please,&quot; Luna echoed. At Makoto&#39;s curious look the cat 
sighed, &quot;Usagi and I aren&#39;t particularly good cooks, I&#39;m sorry to 
say.&quot;

        &quot;Then I&#39;ll cook,&quot; Makoto shrugged, &quot;but you two have to help 
with the cleaning up.&quot;

        &quot;Hai!&quot; Usagi agreed cheerfully.

        They finished up their breakfast, then Usagi and Luna joined 
Makoto in the little kitchen to help clean up. Assigned to do the 
dishwashing, Usagi scrubbed them clean while Luna rinsed and dried, 
and soon they were all done.

        &quot;You&#39;d better get dressed,&quot; Makoto reminded her, &quot;we&#39;ve got 
to go to school soon.&quot;

        &quot;Right,&quot; Usagi bounded back up the stairs, her twin golden 
ponytails bouncing. She stripped her pajamas off quickly, grabbing 
her uniform skirt and blouse and dressing.

        &quot;That was your mother&#39;s apron she was wearing,&quot; Luna&#39;s voice 
was soft, &quot;wasn&#39;t it?&quot;

        &quot;Yes,&quot; Usagi softly answered, and a few tears escaped, 
trickling down her face. She wiped them away with her sleeve, 
forcing a cheerful smile.

        &quot;I&#39;ll..&quot; Luna got up to go back downstairs and have a talk 
with Makoto, but Usagi stopped the cat with a gesture.

        &quot;She didn&#39;t know,&quot; Usagi said quietly, &quot;and I&#39;ve got to 
start getting over this sometime, right?&quot; She grabbed her school-bag 
and rushed downstairs, finding Makoto ready to go.

        &quot;It&#39;s kind of nice to have someone to walk to school with,&quot; 
Makoto noted as they walked, the taller girl shortening her steps a 
bit so Usagi could keep up.

        &quot;I&#39;m a bit embarrassed to say I never saw you at school,&quot; 
Usagi admitted, Luna riding perched on her shoulder.

        &quot;We don&#39;t really hang out with the same sort of crowds,&quot; 
Makoto said gently. She paused before offering, &quot;Do you want me to 
stay away from you during school?&quot;

        &quot;Why?&quot; Usagi looked up at her curiously.

        &quot;You&#39;re reputation, for one,&quot; Makoto smiled wryly, &quot;I&#39;ve got 
a bit of a bad one myself.&quot; Silently she thought, &#39;Not to mention 
the conclusions that some of the more hentai students might come to, 
seeing us together.&#39;

        &quot;Considering I have to carry this thing with me,&quot; Usagi 
nodded to the sword, safely hidden in a long case, &quot;I&#39;m already 
thought of as the odd kendo girl.&quot; She paused, &quot;And I don&#39;t really 
care what people might think seeing us together.&quot;

        The surprised looks on both of Makoto and Luna&#39;s faces were 
just priceless. &quot;Remind me not to underestimate you again,&quot; Makoto 
chuckled to herself softly as the two of them walked through the 
school gates together.

        The university was bustling as Professor Ami Mizuno made her 
way across the campus. She made her way into the administration 
building, then headed up the hall to the president&#39;s office. She 
checked her watch, then knocked firmly.

        &quot;Professor Mizuno,&quot; the secretary smiled up at her a bit 
apologetically from her desk, &quot;the president will be right with you.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Ami took a seat, getting her laptop out of her 
shoulder bag. &#39;Now,&#39; she mused as she went to work, &#39;assuming the 
Youma continue to attack, I should be able to grab enough data to 
determine the central transport nexus they use.&#39; She worked for a 
few moments, until the sound of a throat clearing got her attention.

        &quot;The president will see you now,&quot; the secretary said.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Ami slid the laptop away. She knew that it annoyed 
some people when she went to work while being kept waiting, but that 
didn&#39;t bother too her much. Privately, she had to say that she 
rather enjoyed doing it.

        &quot;Prof. Mizuno,&quot; the president gave her a wary smile as she 
went into his office. They had a interesting relationship, he 
wishing to exercise his authority over her, and Ami calmly ignoring 
him. He cleared his throat, &quot;I was a bit surprised to receive the 
request for a sabbatical from you.&quot;

        &quot;How so?&quot; Ami raised an eyebrow as she sat down, &quot;It is well 
within my rights, under the agreement I signed with the board.&quot;

        It was clear he wasn&#39;t happy about that agreement from the 
way his face flushed. Still, he calmly said, &quot;It&#39;s the undefined 
length of the sabbatical that concerns me.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Ami asked coolly.

        &quot;I&#39;m unsure if we&#39;ll be able to keep the Chair of Chemistry 
open for you,&quot; he smiled, clearly enjoying himself, &quot;if your 
sabbatical runs too long.&quot;

        Ami looked at him, a little tyrant trying to exercise what 
little power he had. Sadly, that sort of thing only worked it the 
victim allowed it. &quot;May I be frank?&quot;

        There was something in her tone of voice that wiped the 
smile right off his face. &quot;Yes?&quot; he asked tentatively.

        &quot;While Tokyo University is a quite well respected school, it 
lacks many scientists of note,&quot; she said coldly. &quot;The majority of 
our professors in residence are no longer being published, or have 
yet to even be published.&quot; A grim smile, &quot;I, on the other hand, am 
published, I have a string of quite profitable patents, and more 
than one university is head- hunting me. Putting it bluntly, you 
need me much more than I need you.&quot;

        The principal&#39;s face was bone pale, and he gulped audibly. 
He couldn&#39;t afford to lose her, and they both knew it. &quot;Your Chair 
will be ready when you return,&quot; he finally managed.

        &quot;Good,&quot; Ami said crisply. Taking some pity on him she 
added, &quot;I hope that my absence will only be a few weeks.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; he sighed weakly.

        Ami strode out of the office a few moments later, giving him 
a chance to save face. The secretary had the oddest smile on her 
pretty face, and she wouldn&#39;t have been surprised if the lady had 
listened in on the conversation.

        &#39;Now,&#39; Ami thought as she strode to her lab to pick up the 
remaining equipment she&#39;d need, &#39;it&#39;s time to really get to work 
finding the enemy.&#39;
