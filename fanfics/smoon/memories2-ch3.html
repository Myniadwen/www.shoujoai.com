<h1>Memories (part 3 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/coconut.html">The Coconut Cyclone</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/memories2-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>I was more than a little shocked when I heard that Usagi had actually 
called a meeting. It&#146;s not her style exactly, mind you she has grown 
in these past few years, but meetings are still usually Luna&#146;s 
territory. Yet, as I listen to her speak, I can see the queen that my 
friend will become. 

She has called us together because of the memories, the dreams. She 
has decided that it&#146;s time that we faced our collective past, and 
apparently Luna is capable of restoring it to us. Everyone is here at 
the temple, even you. Though I don&#146;t really understand your presence. 
You obviously don&#146;t need the past rehashed, you were there. I suppose 
you&#146;re here to help the rest of us deal with it.

I hazard a glance your way. You look troubled, although I doubt any of 
the others would notice. I&#146;ve discovered that since the dreams began I 
can read your moods. I guess it comes from being lovers. At this 
moment you look as if a youma were going to leap out at you at any 
moment. Are you that afraid of the truth coming out?

You catch me looking and I do my best to hold your gaze. Why won&#146;t you 
let me in? I remember enough of the past to realize that we were 
together then, and I want to be together now. You look away as if 
reading my thoughts. 

Ami says something to me and I turn away as well. Looks like they are 
ready to begin. I take a deep breath and close my eyes. All at once 
I&#146;m consumed by wave after wave of images&#133;

***

There&#146;s a flash of light and then, we&#146;re at the gate, arguing. &quot;It&#146;s 
true that we both have a duty, but why should that keep us from being 
together? Uranus and Neptune are in love and it has only made them 
stronger.&quot; You fix your crimson gaze upon me, and remark that Uranus 
and Neptune are not responsible for the gate. 

So that&#146;s what this is about. The gate, it&#146;s always the gate. I think 
you&#146;ve spent so much of your life at this damn gate that you&#146;re afraid 
to live out in the real world. I tell you as much as my eyes lock with 
yours. I will not back down. I will not let you throw this away so 
easily.

&quot;You don&#146;t understand.&quot; You whisper. 

&quot;You&#146;re right, I don&#146;t understand. I don&#146;t understand how you can deny 
what we&#146;ve come mean to one another. Obviously we don&#146;t feel the same. 
I know that I love you, but apparently you don&#146;t share my feelings.&quot; 

I look to you for a denial, a declaration of your feelings, anything. 
You won&#146;t even look at me.

I turn to leave; there&#146;s nothing more to say. You don&#146;t try to stop 
me.

***

Later that day I&#146;m in the training room with Uranus. We&#146;re about an 
hour into our workout when you walk in. Uranus walks over to greet you 
but I continue my routine. 

I&#146;m too angry with you to pretend that everything is normal right now. 
So I focus all my attention on the punching bag I&#146;m currently 
pummeling. I get so into it that I don&#146;t even notice when Uranus 
leaves. 

I do notice, however, when you turn me around and kiss me. You tell me 
that you&#146;re sorry, that you were scared. I laugh at that. Who would 
ever think that Sailor Pluto would ever be afraid of anything? Then 
you say the most wonderful thing of all; you tell me that you love me 
as well. I think that my heart is going to burst through my chest it 
beats so strongly. I&#146;ve never felt so happy before.

***

Another flash&#133;I sigh as I close the door to my quarters. You sit in 
front of my mirror removing the pins from your hair. &quot;We made a bit of 
a scene tonight. I thought the Earth delegation was going to riot when 
they saw us dancing.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t see why so they reacted that way, the Earthers always love it 
when Uranus and Neptune dance.&quot;

&quot;Yes dear, but unlike Uranus you have certain attributes that make it 
quite obvious that you are female. Although, I don&#146;t think they would 
have had that much of a problem with it if you hadn&#146;t insisted on 
kissing me in the middle of the dance floor afterwards.&quot; You point out 
as you pick up a brush.

&quot;So I can&#146;t kiss you in public then?&quot;

&quot;I didn&#146;t say that. It&#146;s just that on Earth people aren&#146;t as open 
minded as those of us who were raised in other parts of the solar 
system. Their beliefs are simply different and I think that we should 
recognize that fact, no matter how pigheaded they are.&quot; 

&quot;Do you really care what a bunch of snobbish courtiers think?&quot; I ask 
removing my shoes.

&quot;Not really. We have the Queen&#146;s blessing and hers is the only opinion 
that makes any difference to me.&quot;

I smile and walk over to you. Wrapping my arms around your shoulders I 
lean forward and whisper in your ear, &quot;Only hers?&quot;

A sly smile plays on your face as you consider my question. &quot;Well, I 
could consider another&#146;s point of view with the proper amount of 
convincing.&quot;

&quot;Well, then allow me to spend the rest of the evening convincing you.&quot; 

***

Yet another flash&#133;I&#146;m dying. I can feel my very blood pouring into the 
ground from my wounds. My princess, I&#146;ve failed her. It&#146;s getting 
harder to breathe. The end is close; I know it. 

So this is what the gate showed you. No wonder you were worried. For 
an instant I consider being angry with you for not stopping this. Yet 
in my heart I know that you couldn&#146;t have changed things. If you had 
interfered the only difference would have been that your body would be 
here next to mine.

It&#146;s getting harder to keep my eyes open. I struggle to keep them 
open, but it&#146;s no use, they close without my permission. Through my 
eyelids I see a flash of light. You&#146;ve come.

Your hand caresses my cheek as lightly as a summer breeze. I want to 
open my eyes, to see your face one last time. I will up the last of 
the strength that I&#146;m so well known for and force them open. 

You gasp, I suppose you thought that I was already too far-gone to 
acknowledge your presence. Your beautiful eyes widen in shock. Ah, so 
even the Guardian of Time can be surprised. 

&quot;Jupiter, I&#146;m sorry&quot; you whisper. 

I don&#146;t know how, but I manage to choke out a ragged &quot;I love you.&quot;

&quot;I love you too.&quot;

I want to stay here with you a little longer, but my eyes are so 
heavy. They close before I can even attempt to fight the black void 
that is rushing towards me.

***

I&#146;m back in the temple. I look around Haruka and Michiru are sitting 
up as well. The others are still out of it. You&#146;re sitting in the 
corner watching Hotaru. I know you realize that I&#146;m awake but you 
won&#146;t look at me.

Suddenly, I can&#146;t stand to be here anymore. I can&#146;t be in the same 
room with you if you won&#146;t even look at me. I have half a mind to walk 
over there and slap some sense into you, but now&#146;s not the time.

I stand up, and start towards the door. Haruka and Michiru try to stop 
me. They tell me that I should wait for the others to wake up. I don&#146;t 
listen. The one person I want to talk about my past with won&#146;t even 
acknowledge my presence, so what&#146;s the point in staying?

I step out into the cool night air and sigh. &quot;One day soon you&#146;re 
going to have to face me Setsuna.&quot;
