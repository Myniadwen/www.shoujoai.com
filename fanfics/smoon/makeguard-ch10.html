The guards were now looking to Ami for their orders. She opened her 
mouth to speak, but stopped when she noticed that they were now 
kneeling. Next to her, Boarder quickly fell to a kneeling position as 
well, her head bowed in reverence. That was when Ami felt a hand on her 
shoulder. Turning, she looked up slightly to see her mother standing 
behind her. The Queen motioned for those bowing to rise, and looked down 
at her daughter. Knowing Ami better than any other soul, she saw the 
distress in her daughter&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Let me take a look,&quot; she said, smiling reassuringly. Ami found relief 
at seeing that smile. Her mother would know what to do, even if she, 
herself, was uncertain. Ami moved aside to let her mother take her place 
next to the Princess of Jupiter. The Queen indicated that Ami should 
open her computer back up and glanced over the small panels and jumping 
lines that flashed precariously across the screen. Nodding to herself, 
and confirming something unspoken, she motioned for the guards to bring 
the stretcher.

She then spoke to all of them, in a very low tone, so that none would 
hear her but those gathered. &quot;I&#39;ve heard the story already, about her 
fight with the Chimera aboard your ship.&quot; She glanced at Boarder, who 
nodded. The Queen continued, &quot;Yes, that was the beast that poisoned her. 
Don&#39;t worry though, it&#39;s a slow acting poison, and can be easily treated 
if you know the antidote. And it just so happens,&quot; she tapped her own 
temple, &quot;that I know exactly the regents needed and have them on hand.&quot; 
There were collective affirmations of relief among them all. &quot;However,&quot; 
she continued in a serious voice, &quot;you are not to speak of this to 
anyone. If someone asks of her condition, then you are to say that she 
was fatigued after such a long trip. She merely pushed herself too far 
during this recent fight, and suffered the consequences.&quot; She looked at 
each one of them in turn. &quot;Do I make myself clear?&quot;

Many nodded, but Ami was confused as to why her mother was telling them 
this. Was there something that she should know? The Queen of Mercury was 
one of the most respected healers alive, so she knew that her diagnoses 
had to be correct. There was something else to this, and she wouldn&#39;t 
question her mother about it until they were alone.

Haruka soon appeared beside the guards, &quot;We&#39;ll take it from here,&quot; she 
said, dismissing them. They nodded, then bowed and left. Rei also joined 
them, and together she and Haruka lifted the unconscious princess onto 
the stretcher. It was a bit short for the tall Jovian, but it proved to 
serve its use well enough for them to carry her down two corridors. They 
brought her to a small, but comfortable room that was sparsely 
furnished. It contained a bed, and a table with two chairs around it. 
The Queen told the two to place Makoto on the bed, and then whispered 
something to Rei, who nodded and proceeded to light the candles situated 
around the room. Ami then realized that Minako had stayed behind with 
Michiru in the Hall. She only noticed this because Minako always liked 
to see Rei use her powers. Rei need do nothing but stand where she was 
and regard each candle in turn, and it would ignite with a thought. She 
prided herself on self control, and her power over fire was one she 
honed to perfection. Soon the room was bathed in the soft glow of the 
candles.

Ami was sent to gather herbs, vials, and various other ingredients for 
her mother from the Palace Apothecary and her mother&#39;s own quarters. 
Though her mother had assured her that everything would be fine, she 
still couldn&#39;t help but rush to gather the items. Upon her return, she 
found Rei standing guard at the door. Ami raised an inquisitive eyebrow 
at the dark-haired warrior.

Rei shrugged, &quot;Your mother sent the Jovians away. Told them that she 
would keep them informed of their princess&#39;s condition,&quot; she used a lazy 
tone that expressed her boredom with the assignment, &quot;Haruka went to 
help Michiru in the Hall. Who knows where Minako&#39;s gotten to.&quot; She 
looked around the hall, as if the blond would jump out of the shadows at 
any given moment.

Ami gave a short laugh, &quot;She&#39;ll turn up eventually; She always does.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure if that would be a good thing or not right now though...&quot; 
Rei trailed off as she moved to let Ami pass.

Her mother was seated in a chair that she had pulled close to the bed, 
and was currently leaning over her patient. Ami drew closer and set the 
items her mother had sent for on the table, which was now also pulled 
closer to the bed as well.

&quot;Is the guard really necessary?&quot; she asked.

&quot;A healer must never be distracted while she works. Sometimes it can 
mean life or death to the one she is tending.&quot;

Ami nodded her understanding.

Her mother had already removed the princess&#39;s shirt. It was thrown over 
the other chair; one whole sleeve was soaked in blood. Ami noticed a 
large amount of bandages over her chest.

&quot;How badly was she wounded?&quot; she asked. &quot;I thought it was only her arm.&quot;

&quot;It is only her arm. The bandages over her chest are her own doing. It 
is not so uncommon for a female warrior to bind her chest. I&#39;ve left it 
on for modesty&#39;s sake.&quot;

&quot;But she was only going to be attending a ball tonight. Why would she 
see a need to?&quot;

&quot;Jovian warriors believe in being prepared at all times for anything. 
Makoto, here, is no exception. I even found this when I removed her 
boots.&quot; She handed Ami a small dagger.

Ami accepted the blade and pulled it partially from its sheath. It 
looked extremely sharp. &quot;Oh,&quot; was her simple reply.

Her mother smiled at her daughter&#39;s uneasy expression. &quot;One might think 
that Jovians would live longer because of such preparation. However, 
there is always something to balance out these things, and that is their 
fierce pride and determination. This more often than not, is what gets 
them killed even before their prime. They feel that they must protect 
others, but will not readily accept any protection of their own.&quot; The 
Queen was cutting away the stitches and cleaning the wound as she 
talked. &quot;Begin preparing and combining those ingredients as I have 
indicated on the parchment there, if you will dear.&quot;

Ami nodded and began doing as told. &#39;What a waste,&#39; she thought, 
glancing at the sleeping Jovian, &#39;such a magnificent being, doomed by 
her own blood to be snuffed out so quickly.&#39; This made her mad just 
thinking about it. She ground the herbs she was working at a little 
harder than intended. &#39;Who&#39;s to say it should be that way? Every person 
is different. We don&#39;t live our lives as our ancestors did. Things 
change...people change.&#39;

&quot;Mother,&quot;Ami began.

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Her mother was now closing the gash in Makoto&#39;s arm with small, 
neat stitches.

&quot;Why did you tell everyone to keep the nature of her wound a secret?&quot;

The Queen didn&#39;t answer right away. She continued with her mending. Ami 
wondered if she&#39;d heard her or not.

&quot;It&#39;s not something that would help the situation right now,&quot; she 
finally answered. &quot;Makoto is different from the rest of you girls, Ami. 
I&#39;m not going to lie to you because I&#39;m sure you would have figured it 
out sooner or later. Her life is in danger every day, whether she&#39;ll 
admit to it or not. It would not due to have her assassin know that the 
poison almost worked. It&#39;s better if they think that she killed the 
beast without difficulty. If they knew the poison may have worked on an 
immortal such as Makoto, they could very well find something more potent 
and come after her again. Though, they will no doubt come after her 
anyway. Hopefully, her presence behind the palace walls will delay their 
treachery for a while. We can only pray that tonight&#39;s events with the 
Harpy had nothing to do with her being here, and that Beryl really was 
just trying to ruin the festivities.&quot;

Ami was beginning to understand the situation. The Princess of Jupiter 
had no family left, and being an immortal, as was Ami and her own 
mother, she would live a very long time. With no family, though, who 
would inherit the throne?

&quot;So someone wants her dead, so that they can take her place? Or is it 
something even more sinister, like the Negaverse?&quot;

Her mother shook her head, &quot;I&#39;m not sure really. Maybe both. Who knows 
with all that&#39;s going on right now. This is, however, a top priority on 
the Queen&#39;s list. Makoto has never reported any of the incidents where 
she was put in danger by one of these assassins, but we&#39;ve been informed 
through other means.&quot;

Ami knew what that implied. &quot;There is a spy among her advisors?&quot; she 
questioned, shocked.

The Queen of Mercury smiled. &quot;Spy is a harsh word to use. It&#39;s just what 
you said, an advisor. We receive reports from them every now and then, 
when something like this happens. She is well guarded, unbeknownst to 
her. She has been raised by them, somewhat, since her parents died. It 
was a necessary action. Since she is a Jovian princess, she must be 
raised in her native homeland. She&#39;s too stubborn to willingly accept 
the help, so it must be done indirectly and in secret.&quot; Her mother was 
finishing up with the stitches on Makoto&#39;s arm.

&quot;If her life is in such danger, why would she not accept the help?&quot;

&quot;Well, Jovans are very protective people. They want to protect, not be 
protected themselves. In exchange for their strength and courage, they 
acquire quite a temper and detachment to those around them. It&#39;s their 
way of caring, as strange as that may seem.&quot;

Ami gave her a weird look.

&quot;What? Well, I find it quite charming when seeing it put into action. 
You haven&#39;t been around Jovians before, so you wouldn&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;They sound grumpy. She didn&#39;t exactly act very friendly with any of us 
tonight either.&quot;

Her mother was now putting a bandage around Makoto&#39;s arm. &quot;Yes, it takes 
a very tolerant person to befriend a Jovian, especially one of royal 
blood. The person who does would be lucky indeed, for the loyalty of a 
royal Jovian is one of the strongest bonds in the universe, but it is 
hard to acquire. They&#39;re too stubborn at times.&quot; Finished with the 
bandage, she moved over to the water, and rinsed her hands.

&quot;As stubborn as Jovians are, Martians can be just as bad. Their passion 
for battle is equal to any Jovian, but they are more in tune with their 
element. Most Martians will not enter a melee battle. They like to keep 
a calm exterior and weigh their options if at all possible. They can 
make wonderful leaders.&quot;

&quot;Rei is always calm...unless Minako or Usagi is around. Then her temper 
can flare up.&quot;

Her mother moved to help her with the antidote. &quot;That&#39;s just how friends 
are. I knew a Martian like that too. And Minako may play around a lot, 
but Venusians are amazing leaders as well. With their pleasant looks and 
sweet words, they are at home in any political setting. They could 
convince a Mercurian that the Moon was the center of the Universe if you 
gave them enough time.&quot;

Ami shook her head.

&quot;Hmm, so you don&#39;t agree?&quot; she asked her daughter, while helping to mix 
the ingredients for the antidote.

&quot;Minako has tried to convince me of many things on several occasions. 
She has never succeeded though.&quot;

The queen unstopped a vial. &quot;I would assume that the reason for this is 
because she sees you as a friend. Minako would never try to force an 
idea on you that she knew you didn&#39;t agree with. That won&#39;t stop her 
form teasing of course, but still. One thing I&#39;ve learned about 
Venusians is that they are impulsive. They will leap without looking, 
but once they have time to think, they usually know when to stop. 
Sometimes the damage is irreparable, other times only minor.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;Minako has been getting into a lot of trouble with Usagi 
lately. She&#39;ll get one of her ideas and convince Usagi that it&#39;s the 
most wonderful plan in the Universe. She always falls for it.&quot;

The Queen laughed. &quot;Yes, Minako is a lot of trouble. She&#39;s very 
energetic, and fearless. That&#39;s why I hope that you and Rei will watch 
over her. She probably doesn&#39;t know what she can and can&#39;t handle.&quot; Her 
mother&#39;s tone became more natural as she talked with her daughter. &quot;I 
believe that she will turn out to be a good Queen one day, but that will 
not be for some time now...at least, I hope.&quot; She looked over at Makoto, 
and noticing that the woman had begun to sweat again, she moved to 
gently wipe her face with a cloth. Her eyes were sad.

&quot;Is something wrong mother?&quot; Ami asked.

Her mother finished dabbing Makoto&#39;s forehead, and stared at her 
sleeping face. She said nothing for a moment, then, &quot;Makoto will become 
Queen of Jupiter on her one hundredth birthday. I wonder, will she be 
ready?&quot; She sighed, &quot;So young...she&#39;s just too young for such a burden. 
Growing up so alone, she should have had more friends, and a family to 
support her through it all. It was an enormous loss when her parents 
were killed. I did not know them quite as well as I would have liked to. 
We Mercurians are always such a bore. We love knowledge, yet we tend to 
look for it in the wrong places. I would never known the sound of the 
King&#39;s voice from reading it in a book. Nor would I have seen exactly 
how beautiful the Queen was, or the power that was immanent in the 
Jovian Palace. You could only feel it if you were actually there. Or, 
what does twilight look like on Ganymede? And I would never have know 
there daughter would grow into such a strong, beautiful woman.&quot;

Ami set the completed antidote on the table between them and met her 
mother&#39;s eyes.

&quot;Not all knowledge is gained through reading books Ami. You don&#39;t have 
to study and work all of the time. If there is one thing I want you to 
remember, above all others, it is that nothing beats an experience. Did 
you know that Queen Serenity is partial to sweets, and that she has five 
pet rabbits? She also practices ice skating, even though she falls more 
often than not. That, you do not learn in a book or on a computer. You 
have to connect with others. Learn about the person, not the race. 
Makoto, here,&quot; she gestured at the woman on the bed, &quot;you already knew 
about. Having read about Jovians, you probably already defined her 
character long ago. You had this stereotypical mental image of her, 
didn&#39;t you?&quot;

Ami nodded, listening intently. It was not often that she was able to 
hear her mother speak this much. She was usually traveling because of 
her occupation as a healer. Every little bit of knowledge that she could 
get from her was taken to heart. Her mother had never been wrong.

&quot;And she was very boring. Just another Jovian, far away from Mercury. 
Maybe one day you would meet her, but she didn&#39;t sound very interesting 
in the book.

Another nod was her answer.

&quot;But here we have her, Princess Makoto of Jupiter. Can you so easily 
define her? I can guess the physical description did not do her justice. 
And we can only wonder how she acquired some of these scars.&quot; She 
indicated Makoto&#39;s neck and arms, where several scars of different sizes 
could be seen. There was even a long one running across her side. &quot;See, 
already we know something about her that no one will ever read in that 
book.&quot; She smiled, &quot;And once we give her this antidote, she&#39;ll be well 
again. Then you can start creating your own definition of the Princess 
of Jupiter.&quot;

Ami smiled at her mother as she watched her take the antidote and turn 
to Makoto. The Queen showed her how to get the unconscious woman to 
drink the liquid. When she was done, she rose form her chair. &quot;If you 
don&#39;t fell like staying here, I&#39;m sure that I could send for a guard to 
watch over her tonight. She should wake up soon, but she needs to sleep. 
I just don&#39;t want her to wake u in a strange room alone.&quot;

Ami shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ll be fine, It&#39;s no trouble at all. I&#39;m going to 
need to get used to this if I am to be a good healer.&quot;

Her mother looked pleased. &quot;Well then, I see no problem with that. If 
you change your mind, though, or if she gives you any trouble, don&#39;t 
hesitate to summon someone to take your place.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;ll be fine.&quot; The Queen bent forward and placed a kiss on 
the top of Ami&#39;s head.

She turned to go, but stopped. &quot;Another thing Ami. I don&#39;t want you to 
ever feel as though you are useless.&quot;

Ami said nothing.

&quot;I saw the look in your eyes tonight. You were afraid. No one else would 
have known the antidote for that poison. I am one of the few who know of 
it in the universe. Now, you have joined those few. Don&#39;t forget that 
you&#39;re not alone. There are others here to help, and we&#39;ll never blame 
you if you don&#39;t have the answer. Just preform to the best of your 
ability in everything you do. That&#39;s all that I can ask of you.&quot; The 
Queen of Mercury left, smiling.

&quot;Goodnight then dear.&quot;

&quot;Goodnight mother.&quot;

A few moments later, the door closed behind her, leaving Ami alone with 
the sleeping Jovian.

&#39;Time slips away so quickly,&#39; Rei thought, as she leaned heavily against 
the wall, outside the chamber. Her jacket lay abandoned on a chair that 
the Queen of Mercury had provided for her. Rei had insisted on staying. 
She didn&#39;t think Ami could handle the Jovian by herself if she gave the 
small woman any trouble. This seemed to relieve the queen. Rei chose to 
stand, for she knew that the moment she sat down, sleep would take her.

&#39;I remember her now. She was so small and helpless looking back then. 
She&#39;s changed so much that I can&#39;t believe I was looking at the same 
person,&#39; the door was left open just enough for Rei to look in on them. 
Ami was sitting at the table, silently reading and glancing over at 
Makoto from time to time. &#39;She&#39;s already on her way to being a great 
healer,&#39; Rei smiled. Her eyes drifted to the form on the bed. &#39;So 
different from that girl of long ago. The one that I caught glances of, 
hiding behind her father&#39;s leg or her mother&#39;s dress.&#39; Rei had never met 
Makoto. None of them had, because Makoto was a terribly shy child back 
then. Her parents worried nothing of it, though, saying that it was just 
a phase that she would soon grow out of. It was something she was forced 
to resolve after their deaths. Perhaps Makoto had been forced to grow 
out of many things. How different was she from the other princesses?

Rei leaned back against the wall, once again, and let out a long sigh as 
she closed her eyes. Thoughts of the night&#39;s events bombarded her mind. 
It was tiring to her, to have to sort through so many things that 
troubled her like this. She couldn&#39;t possibly figure all of this out 
now, while she was this worn out. She pushed the thoughts from her mind, 
resolving that she would deal with them tomorrow, during her daily 
meditation.

That, of course, providing that Minako didn&#39;t decide to come wake her 
with a bucket of ice water in the middle of it. She was always doing 
things like that to her. &#39;Why does she get so much joy out of torturing 
me?&#39;

Rei cringed at the memory of one particular occasion in which Minako had 
waited until Rei was deep into a relaxed state of meditation. She&#39;d then 
snuck up behind her, and poured an entire wineskin over her head, 
drenching her clean to her undergarments. Yet again, Rei let her temper 
get to her that day, and had to go running after the blond like a mad 
woman. Minako was laughing the whole way through the corridors of the 
palace, while shouting that she was being chased by a mad, drunk 
Martian. Rei had never been so embarrassed in her life.

Then there was the time when Rei was again meditating in front of the 
fire, as usual. A strange smell broke her concentration. She remembered 
opening her eyes to find a grinning Minako roasting some sort of food 
over the sacred fire. And to her utter horror, she&#39;d also turned to see 
a sheepish Usagi doing the same thing. Rei came very close to burning 
Minako alive that day.

Rei just didn&#39;t understand why Minako was always doing these things to 
her. She hardly ever pulled pranks on Ami. Minako had done these things 
when they were children, but not to such an extreme. As they got older, 
Minako started to pester her whenever they were together. If they were 
in the same room, she would be near Rei. She was always there, pulling 
Rei out fo her own world. Rei could never concentrate properly with the 
impending doom that is Minako close by. The more Rei matured, the more 
Minako seemed to bother her. She couldn&#39;t figure out why Minako bugged 
her so much.

She suddenly felt the weight of something cold against her neck, and 
jumped, opening her eyes in surprise. The surprise faded when she saw 
who it was. Minako&#39;s smiling face hovered inches from her own. She held 
a chip of ice in the air between them. In her other hand she carried a 
wooden tankard. Rei lifted one eyebrow, &quot;Are you drinking, Mina?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; she answered, lowering her arm and pulling away, 
&quot;honestly, it&#39;s just water.&quot; she lifted it to Rei&#39;s face for her 
inspection.

Peering into the tankard, Rei looked skeptical, &quot;Sure it is, Mina,&quot; Then 
she crossed her arms and leaned back against the wall.

&quot;You don&#39;t believe me? Fine then,&quot; Minako pulled another ice cube from 
the tankard. This time she brought the ice to Rei&#39;s mouth and pushed it 
through her partially opened lips. Rei was too startled to react as 
Minako kept two fingers firmly over her mouth, holding it closed.

&quot;Well? You don&#39;t taste any alcohol, do you?&quot;

Rei shivered. She was aware of how warm Minako&#39;s fingers were in 
contrast to the ice in her mouth. She shook her head, as best she could, 
in reply.

Minako nodded and let her hand fall to her side. &quot;Told ya,&quot; she said, 
smiling up at her.

Rei just nodded, and looked down the hall, letting the ice melt in her 
mouth. &quot;I was just kidding.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s so hard to tell sometimes, if you are or not,&quot; said Minako. &quot;You 
can be too serious, you know?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m a person of great influence Mina, you know that,&quot; she returned her 
attention to the blond. &quot;I have to set a good example. Any improper 
behavior might give reason for some to doubt my visions.&quot;

Leaning on the wall next to Rei, Minako shook her head. &quot;We&#39;re in an 
empty corridor, well past time for the ones you speak of to be in their 
beds. It&#39;s just you and me here, and you know I&#39;d never doubt you.&quot;

Rei looked into light blue eyes, filled with sincerity. She felt 
strange...kind of tingly. No, Minako never questioned her integrity, 
ever. When had Rei become like this? So wound up was she, in this 
facade. The one she created to ward off the disappointed stares and 
suspicious glances. Trust was all that she wanted. To have a gift, such 
as her own, was a blessing and a burden. Some were jealous, and others 
gave no merit to her visions. She could not afford to slip up, for many 
influential people sought to discredit her. But Minako was correct. 
There was no one here now. No one to question her every move. Yet she 
still acted; and how easy it was to act. She wondered if it was still an 
act at all.

Rei continued to stare into Minako&#39;s eyes. They held concern, and the 
anger she felt for Rei&#39;s enemies. But there was something else Rei 
sensed as well. Something hidden, but not quite. It was powerful, 
whatever it was, but she couldn&#39;t quite discern it. A passion of some 
sort...but for what? What did Minako feel so strongly about? Now, it 
became more vivid, the longer Rei looked into those eyes. Rei knew that 
she, herself, wore a confused expression. She was getting frustrated not 
knowing what it was. This must have been apparent to Minako, for soon 
uncertainty joined her maelstrom of emotions, confusing Rei.

Still, she found that one passion again, wanting to know what it was. 
She leaned forward, the proximity making it stronger. Suddenly, Minako&#39;s 
eyes widened slightly as she took a small step backward. Confusion and 
uncertainty swept over Minako&#39;s eyes, concealing Rei&#39;s quarry. Rei&#39;s own 
head filled with confusion as she turned her head away from Minako.

She felt a loss, and didn&#39;t know why. She&#39;d looked Minako in the eyes 
plenty of times before. What was so different now? &#39;It must be because 
it&#39;s so late. Yeah, that&#39;s it, and I can&#39;t think straight right now.&#39; 
Nodding to herself and grimacing, she turned to Minako. The other woman 
was very rigid, clutching her tankard and looking at the floor. &#39;What is 
wrong with you though? You&#39;re acting so out of character Mina. Are you 
hiding something from me?&#39;

She returned to her normal stature and, obtaining her neutral visage, 
she said, &quot; Stay here okay. I&#39;m going to see if someone is down the 
corridor there.&quot; Rei&#39;s voice was flat, and she cursed herself for 
sounding that way. She didn&#39;t mean for it to come out like that.

Minako frowned at her tone, and used one equally devoid of emotion. 
&quot;Sure. It might be someone spying on you. Wouldn&#39;t want to be seen 
talking with a delinquent like me.&quot; She then quietly slipped through the 
door to the small room, closing it completely behind her.

Rei&#39;s anger rose in response to Minako&#39;s demeanor. Who was she to act 
that way? Rei wasn&#39;t the one hiding things. Minako had some mysterious 
secret, and by the fires of Mars, Rei was going to find out what she was 
hiding. She needed to know. Now that she had a sense of it, she couldn&#39;t 
get rid of it. It tickled at the back of her mind, teasing Rei and her 
ignorance. &#39;That woman is going to drive me mad one day.&#39; She began 
walking in the dim light, towards the presence that she&#39;d sensed 
earlier. Rei felt drained; she just needed rest, that was all. Then 
tomorrow morning she would clear all of this up during meditation. &#39;That 
is, if Minako doesn&#39;t decide to take her revenge on me then.&#39;</pre>
