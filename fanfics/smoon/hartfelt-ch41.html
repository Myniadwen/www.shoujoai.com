<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 41 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch40.html">Back to Part 40</a><p><u>(One year later)</u></p><p>It was a bright, sunny day in Venus. The people’s ruler, 
Venus Minako, was on her way to the resting place. With a bunch of blue-flowered bouquets 
held tightly in her hands, she skipped down the dirt path with an unusual bounce in her 
step.</p><p><i>I can hardly believe how fast time has passed. It’s already been a year since 
the war has ended.</i></p><p><i>After the war ended, we held one large memorial service for 
everyone who died in the war... including Apollo and Queen Serenity. Even now, I don’t 
really know the story behind Apollo, but... I would like to think that he found some sense 
of peace in the end. We haven’t heard from him or the others ever since.</i></p><p><i>After 
that, everybody went separates ways to rebuild their lives again. The Planetary Alliance is 
still in effect though. I haven’t really heard from anyone in awhile, but the last I heard, 
there was some discussion about making Usagi the Head of the Alliance. Heh, Usagi... </i>The 
thought of the young woman brought a smile to her face. <i>I heard that the movement from 
Earth to the Moon is going well. Not to mention, her and that King of Earth seemed to be 
hitting it off pretty well too.</i></p><p>Minako’s thoughts were interrupted when she 
finally reached a set of white gates. She eyed them thoughtfully for a moment; it was just 
as she had left it. Despite the rough weather they had been experiencing recently, the gates 
were still unsullied and dutiful in their guard.</p><p>With a flick of her wrist Minako 
released the spell binding them shut and slipped inside. The gate creaked as she carefully 
closed it behind her.</p><p>“Ah...This place is really coming along well.” A smile graced 
her pink lips as she peered around at all of the flowers. The gardener had met her 
specifications to a tee.</p><p>As she continued down the brick path she sighted the stone 
monument towering in the distance overhead. She always felt nostalgic when she came to 
visit. But as sad as it made her feel, when one considered what could have been, she instead 
thought that she should count herself lucky that they were able to salvage any her family’s 
remains to bury. Now they all could rest in peace.</p><p>“Huh?” Minako finally reached the 
end of the path, but she hesitated when she saw the gravestones. On each of the stones 
someone had laid a bouquet of flowers. <i>That’s strange, did the gardener do this? </i>Her 
brow was furrowed in thought, but her feet were a few steps ahead of her mind. Such a thing 
was not possible; the only one who was strong enough to undo the seal on the gates on Venus 
was her.</p><p>Minako bent down in front of the nearest gravestone and felt her breath catch 
in her chest when she realized what they were.</p><p>“Red flowers...” With a shaky hand she 
touched one of them, confirming her suspicions with her own eyes.</p><p><i>There’s only one 
other place...where I’ve seen these before. </i></p><p>A minute later, Minako ran out of the 
resting place with a bright smile on her face. She had left her bouquets beside the other 
ones on the stones.</p><p><u>(Palace Garden)</u></p><p>In her hurry, Minako slammed the gate 
shut behind her with a noise. She couldn’t care less about the racket she may have been 
causing but to her luck the door hadn’t quite been caught by the catch. She skidded to a 
stop and stared at the half-open, hanging door for a split second. She had half the mind to 
fix that little error, but before she knew it she had already abandoned the thought; her 
heart was already pounding so hard. Running as fast as her legs could carry her she ran up 
the re-built brick pathways to the very back until she finally caught sight of the flower 
beds. Minako could hardly believe her eyes; there was someone waiting there.</p><p>“Rei!” 
She yelled out and waved to the woman as she turned around and looked. Rei 
smiled.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“HEY?!” Minako ran towards her at full blast and tackled her 
straight to the ground. She could hear Rei protesting beneath her as they rolled around in 
the grass but she didn’t have the heart to let her go so soon. “I haven’t heard from you in 
days and all you have to say is ‘hey?!’”</p><p>The world stopped spinning when Minako 
finally pinned Rei down. Seeing that she had been captured, Rei blew her bangs out of her 
eyes and offered a weak shrug in response.</p><p>“I see you’ve gotten 
stronger.”</p><p>“Flatterer.” She smirked back. “Nice try, but don’t think you’re getting 
off the hook that easily.” Minako leaned back and flicked Rei’s nose, to which she made a 
face in response. “Really, it’s been a whole week since you last called! I was starting to 
get--”</p><p>“Worried?”</p><p>Minako froze. She stared down into Rei’s dark eyes—behind the 
feigned innocence in them, she saw the mischievousness there, and, perhaps, a touch of 
smugness.</p><p>“Pfft, no way! I was just—umm—annoyed! Yeah, that’s totally it! Like, I 
mean, why would I worry about a bum like you?” <i>Damn that mind reading thing! 
</i></p><p><i>A bum? </i>Rei was about to say something to that remark but she stopped when 
Minako suddenly went quiet. There was a thoughtful expression on her face.</p><p>“We 
practically talk everyday and then suddenly, without a word, you stopped calling. You 
wouldn’t pick up either. I mean, what’s up with that...?”</p><p>Rei awkwardly sighed and 
clasped one of Minako’s hands. “Sorry... It was—There was a just a lot that I needed to get 
done before today. Getting away is already hard as it is. Besides, it sounded like you were 
going to be really busy all week too. With getting things ready and 
all...”</p><p>“Mm...”</p><p>“But, you’re right. I should have said something before, and for 
that I apologize.” Rei was surprised when Minako suddenly giggled.</p><p>“That’s just so 
like you...”</p><p>“Hm? What did you say?” She received a playful slap in the shoulder. 
“Oof! Wha-What was that for?!”</p><p>“I saaaaid you need to loosen up! Jeez, there’s no need 
to be so formal...”</p><p>After shifting around slightly beneath Minako’s weight, Rei asked, 
“So, does that mean I’m forgiven? Or...” She flipped them over suddenly and Minako shrieked 
in surprise. “Do I still need to make it up to you?”</p><p>Still giggling lightly, Minako 
raised her arms up and draped them over Rei’s head. “Mm...I’ll have to think about it.” With 
that she placed a kiss on Rei’s forehead, and hugged her tight. In a very soft voice, she 
whispered, “I’m really happy that you’re here. For a moment there, I was worried that you 
forgot.”</p><p>This admission had momentarily taken Rei aback.</p><p>“Don’t be stupid. How 
could I forget?”</p><p>They both sat up to looked to the blue flowers in the flowerbed 
nearby. Each and every one of them had blossomed. It was just as Minako had promised-- they 
were beautiful-- the best in the entire garden.</p><p>“It looks like they turned out well.” 
Rei commented. She saw Minako nod beside her.</p><p>“Mm. Last year they were a bit 
late...but this year, I don’t think the timing could have been any more perfect. 
Anyway...Have you heard from any of the others lately?”</p><p>“Hmm...Actually, I haven’t. 
I’ve been pretty busy lately.”</p><p>Minako chuckled as she siddled up into the Martian’s 
side and entwined their fingers. “You’ve been saying that quite a bit. So, are you going to 
enlighten me and tell me exactly what it is that you’ve been so busy with? 
Hmmm..?”</p><p>“Oh, you know...Meetings, paperwork...Okay, lots and lots of 
paperwork.”</p><p>“Ugh,” Minako made a face. “No offense, but that sounds pretty boring! 
But, I guess I shouldn’t complain too much since that’s what I’ve been doing lately too.” 
She noted the thoughtful look on the other’s woman face. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“Hm? Oh, 
well, I was just thinking...”</p><p>“About?”</p><p>“...Ares.”</p><p>“What about him...? You 
aren’t still having regrets are you?”</p><p>Rei shook her head. “No, it’s nothing like that. 
It’s just-- I almost can’t believe it’s already been a whole year already. Before, when he 
was gone, I didn’t really care if he ever came back. But now, now that I know the reason why 
he’s gone, it just...makes me think, that’s all.”</p><p>She felt Minako lightly squeeze her 
hand. “Yeah, I know...”</p><p><i>My condition hasn’t given me a problem ever since I’ve 
become a Goddess. When he first taught me the technique, and I found out about it...I wasn’t 
sure what to think. I wondered if he really meant to make me his heir. But thinking back on 
it now...maybe...it was just his way of telling me to live.</i></p><p>Minako blinked, and 
then smiled. “Yeah. Maybe you’re right...”</p><p><i>Who knows...But it’s all in the past 
now. We have to keep moving forward, right? </i></p><p>She felt Rei squeeze back. “Hm. I 
suppose so. Which reminds me—I know I’m early, but aren’t the others supposed to be arriving 
soon? The Planetary Meeting is being hosted here today isn’t it?”</p><p>Minako’s face 
instantly lit up. “Yup! That’s right! Since Venus has been absent for so long, I thought it 
would be only natural that it should be our turn to host! Everything’s pretty well set up 
too! The kitchens are finishing preparations on the food, the party decor has already been 
completed for hours, AND we have a local music group coming in to play live music! You know 
what that means don’t you?” She shot Rei a happy smile. The Goddess of War was almost afraid 
to ask.</p><p>“UMM...”</p><p>“DANCING!”</p><p>Rei groaned as Minako leapt up to her feet and 
began to twirl around with an imaginary partner.</p><p>“After all, the last time we danced I 
didn’t get to dress up.”</p><p>“You could’ve, but you were too busy “studying”.” Rei pointed 
out.</p><p>“Oh, pish posh! Minor details! The important thing is...this time, you’ll get to 
see me all dressed up!”</p><p>Rei blushed deeply at the thought. Actually, she didn’t really 
mind that thought of seeing her partner in formal clothing.</p><p>“It’ll be a lot of fun! I 
can hardly wait.” Minako squealed as she sat herself down by Rei again and snuggled against 
her. Rei didn’t pull away, but cuddled back. With the other woman so close, she deeply 
inhaled the scent of her hair. It had a mixture of flowery scents that she couldn't quite 
identify, only that it was all Minako.</p><p>“You really haven’t changed at all.” She 
finally said. She heard Minako sigh quietly on her shoulder.</p><p>“Well, that’s because... 
the important things stay the same...”</p><p>Rei silently pondered over the words for a 
moment. That reminded her—she <i>had </i>forgotten something very important.</p><p>“Hey, 
Mina...?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>They were suddenly distracted when they heard the garden gate 
being opened in the distance. Someone was coming. Rei half grumbled to herself as they both 
reluctantly parted and turned to see who it was. It was one of Venus’s elite 
guards.</p><p>“Your Majesty!” Render saluted.</p><p>Minako stood up, Rei following right 
behind her. “Good afternoon, Render.” She nodded. “Do you have good news for 
me?”</p><p>“Yes! Your Highness’s guests have arrived! I thought I would come and tell 
you!”</p><p>“Ah, I see. Well, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. If it’s not too 
much trouble, would you please inform them that we’ll be right there shortly?”</p><p>“It’s 
no trouble at all! I would be more than happy to.”</p><p>As the man went on his way, Minako 
noticed a thoughtful look on the Martian’s face.</p><p>“A penny for your 
thoughts?”</p><p>“...He sure is energetic, isn’t he?”</p><p>Minako leaned into her side 
suggestively and smiled. “Jealous?”</p><p>Rei responded with something of a snort as she 
turned the beautiful woman around in her arms and took her hands into hers. As Minako 
continued to stare in Rei’s eyes, infuriatingly, she found that she was unable to stop 
herself from turning red in the face. They were so close—why was Rei looking at her like 
that?</p><p>Rei cleared her throat before she spoke. “Before I was interrupted...There was 
something that I wanted to ask you.”</p><p>“Huh? Oh, sure. What is it?”</p><p>“Do you 
remember that Venusian custom that you told me about some time ago?” Minako’s face instantly 
darkened a few shades of crimson at the memory. She didn’t say anything but simply nodded in 
response.</p><p>Without any warning Rei leaned in. Minako jumped a little when the woman’s 
breath touched her lips. “Just between you and me...I’m thinking of starting a Martian one, 
but only with a certain Venusian. Because...I really...”</p><p>Rei gave Minako’s ear a nip 
and heard the Venusian yelp. Rei then walked past the woman and left her standing there in a 
daze.</p><p>For a second, Minako didn’t even know what happened. But then something occurred 
to her.</p><p>“REI?!” She shouted. Rei was halfway through the garden by now. “When you said 
Venusian, you meant me, RIGHT?!”</p><p>Rei’s laughter could be heard throughout the entire 
garden as Minako chased after her.</p><p><i>...You know...I think that’s the first time I’ve 
ever heard Rei laugh...</i></p><hr size=1 noshade><p><b>The End</b></p>
