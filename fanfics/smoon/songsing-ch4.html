<p><u>“<em>Feather filled pillows versus sleeping bags – iv”</em></u></p>
<p>They  pressed gently against the fabric of her top with every breath she  took. He had wagered they were about a handful. Not overly large, nor  inconceivably <em>small</em> but like the American fairy tale – they were just...<em>perfect</em>.  Tetsuo Ishikawa made a modest living working as a cab driver for Narita  International. The interior of his little Daihatsu smart car saw all  walks of life and was sometimes privy to stars that wanted to be  incognito. Ishikawa was the man they turned to. He was known for his  discretion...but more so for his lechery.</p>
<p>Ah yes, the man had many a catch in his cab. He loved them all. Women. Young, fast and strong-willed. They <em>had</em> to be attractive. Personality was fine but with all truthfulness, would one <em>choose</em> fantasizing about loving a pug-faced baboon of a lady in the back of a  Daihatsu? Ishikawa didn’t. And when this God-sent, nubile woman chose  his services the lecher was beyond Saint Peter’s gates.</p>
<p><em>Ah...the angel took a breath again!</em></p>
<p>He  lifted his hand to adjust his rear-view, resting now at the gentle  hollow of her slender throat. Her pulse was steady, he saw. Knocking  against the supple bronzed flesh – <em>it beat just for him</em>. An uncomfortable feeling began to throb below his waist. Irately the 42-year-old man shifted his position.</p>
<p>The  picture wasn’t complete without a look at her eyes and lips. So again  his gruff hand traveled to the rear view, pushing the mirror upward  just a tad...</p>
<p>“One more time Ishikawa-san and you <em>will</em> understand the true meaning of <em>Blue Balls</em>.”</p>
<p>He  winced. Her voice was dulcet yes but it was edged with injected venom  that he knew, was no bluff. Ever since the woman settled herself into  his cab the heat had been turned up, so to speak. She never said more  than a few words but there was something about her. Her eyes conveyed  everything to him. As it’s said, the eyes are the windows to your soul.  His angel’s were intense, radiating with an inner fire – but above all  were dressed with tumult.</p>
<p>It had been well more than just a few  minutes since they arrived at her point of destination. A half-hour, at  best guess. But his angel still sat there, gazing out the window.  Ishikawa turned his eyes followed her line of site.</p>
<p>Silently his chapped lips mouthed the words, ‘<em>The Crown</em>’.  Furrowing his brow he recognized it as the local town’s teenaged  hangout. Why they were there, sitting stationary was beyond his scope.  Just as well, it gave him more time to spend basking in his fiery  angel’s wake. A lazy Cheshire grin spread over his face before hearing  movement at the back of his cab. Casting a starry eyed glance over his  shoulder he found his client’s positioning changed. Curious, Ishikawa  darted his gaze back towards the establishment.</p>
<p>A mid sized car  pulled along the curb of where the Crown was located. Two occupants  were in the vehicle the larger of the two pulled himself from the  driver’s side. Easy to see now, it was colored man. A very rich colored  man. Ishikawa was near blinded with the reflection of light that played  from the man’s thickly banded jewelry. As the foreigner rounded the  car, the passenger side popped open. A dainty hand emerged from the  bowels of the car. Despite the baseball cap pulled tightly about her  head...the cab driver sucked in his breath.</p>
<p>“Hey...isn’t that...??”, said the driver excitedly.</p>
<p>“I didn’t pay you to speak,” she murmured.</p>
<p>“Ahh...hai, gomenasai.”</p>
<p>“Follow when they leave.”</p>
<p>He  nodded quickly, as his hands gripped the wheel. Still more people  filtered from the Crown. An outing of sorts had been planned and the  driver of the Daihatsu had been the unwitting choice to spirit the  brooding woman that was seated in the back. Soon the term <em>mistress</em> ran amok in his mind.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Rei  was lost in her own world too busy to even notice the slight film of  sweat that the driver had developed on his forehead. And it wasn’t  because it was a terribly balmy day in Japan. In fact winter had come  early this year. The day had been unnaturally crystalline. Colors were  sharply defined and contrasted – it seemed almost surreal. <em>Something</em> will happen, that’s all the priestess knew. With the brief snippet of  what Minako had explained, the girls were planning a picnic. The  starlet and her lover were to meet Makoto and perhaps the rest. The  miko didn’t know at what time. So, she had hired this cab and literally  beelined her way here. A haunt of her past.</p>
<p>It was as if time  stood stationary. A few shops granted, had been put out of business.  But the Crown remained. The sign had been dressed in different neon  colors – the only <em>real</em> change. At least on its exterior. It was  a school day so there were no children out and about. Ideal day for an  outing. Her body had gone rigid even before her eyes pinioned the  source of her subtle reaction.</p>
<p>A car had arrived on the scene.  The Singer’s gallant knight came to her aid then, helping her from the  passenger’s side. Rei chuckled to herself – a half smile coursed her  lips.</p>
<p>“Brat,” a breathless prod uttered to ears that would never hear it.</p>
<p>Rei’s  gaze remained rapt on the Singer. Minako was casually dressed in a pair  of blue sweats, that almost doubles as a pair of bell bottoms with how  they flared at her calves. A singular stripe accented her wear, tracing  her ample thighs. Coursing her gaze upward, the miko clucked her tongue  upon the roof of her mouth. Minako’s top was equally simple, a mere  jacket like sweater gently hugged the singer’s lithe body; the woman  was the epitome of style and beauty.</p>
<p>The minko’s appraisal of the  woman beyond her reach came to a stop. She was never allowed to see  those features she grew accustomed to years ago. Minako was all but  joined to the hip of her lover.</p>
<p>Rei shouldn’t’ve expected anything less.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>A  massive yet slightly calloused hand eased under the fringes of her  shirt, pads of that very hand brushed gently against her flesh. They  then hooked its thick digits at the waistband of her sweats tugging her  backward. Her body became flushed against a taut frame. And this was  the game he played every time in public. There was no such thing as  personal space between the pair. Soon Minako found herself being  manuvered between his legs and confining arms snaking about her  mid-section. Behind closed doors, Minako prefers the intimate ambiance  where she’s able to give more of herself freely without ridicule,  publicly – she would rather do without. Too many a time had tabloids  stabbed into her life and near ruined her. But it seems this day she  had no say in the matter. Terry was staking his claim.</p>
<p>“...that okay Minako?”</p>
<p>Someone  had obviously asked her a question. It took all but a second for the  singer to realize her mind hadn’t been on the conversation. It had been  elsewhere since this morning and even before that phone incident.  Almost blankly, the star looked from one person to the next.</p>
<p>A kiss was placed on the back of her head, “Well?”</p>
<p>Terry.  Terry had been the one speaking. Breathing in deeply, the woman  tendered out her lie, “I’m sorry, the concert is on my mind – It <em>is</em> my last stop, I want to make it special,” she paused and sheepishly  smiled. None knew better and afforded the Star the benefit of the  doubt. They always did.</p>
<p>“See now, that won’t do no good – didn’t I say your thoughts were supposed to be on <em>me</em> twenty-four seven?”, teased the Football star. Garnering a few chuckles from the rest of the rather large group.</p>
<p>Minako  gave a tired smile and inwardly the woman was pleased that her beau had  paid heed to her – starting on the right foot for once by speaking in  her native tongue. It seemed that everyone had been tittering amongst  themselves with little or no tension. At this, Minako gave her lover a  squeeze of his arms, a sort of a silent thank you.</p>
<p>“Lapps-san...”, began Ami.</p>
<p>“Terry,” interjected the hulking male.</p>
<p>“h-hai, Terry-san...,” corrected a slightly nervous Ami.</p>
<p>“Just  Terry, Ami. Das fine – ain’t gon’ bite your head off, shorty. Y’hella  too fine with it glued to yo’body”, replied the proverbial flirt.</p>
<p>Makoto  went wide-eyed, Usagi grinned, Mamoru and Motoki, two males that Minako  had introduced earlier, laughed and Ami...So noted Minako – near  collapsed. It seemed Terry had been welcomed into the fold. No one  could resist his charm. If he just gave her more time, the Singer knew  she could very well give everything she <em>is</em> to him. But this is  as close as she could comply. Canting her head to one side, Minako  decided to forget what had earlier transpired in the day and slipped  herself into the <em>now. </em>Or try to.</p>
<p>Visibly Ami fought to regain her composure and won quite admirably.</p>
<p>“T..terry mentioned you wanted to stop somewhere before the park?” offered the good doctor, albeit shakily.</p>
<p>Tracing idle patterns over Terry’s forearms, Minako nodded. “I can take a cab – it’s not too far from here.”</p>
<p>Assenting  with quick nods the group began to break into two parties. The girls  were to ride with Terry, while the foodstuff was stored into Motoki’s  compact Daewoo. As they all pitched in, the Football player once more  arrested Minako to his side. Relinquishing her inhibitions – at least  for now, the icon curled her arms about her lover’s neck. Her body  melded perfectly with his.</p>
<p>“What?” a kittenish smile spread over her features.</p>
<p>“You  have no idea what you do to me.” Terry eased his forehead to rest  against hers as he continued, “Don’t take too long, I’ll miss you  somethin’ awful, woman.”</p>
<p>She laughed, but it was silenced as his  lips pressed hungrily against her own. Minako had barely time to assess  what happened. It was searing to her, more so than usual, he knew  everything about her. What buttons were where and how to push her to  her limits. His lips were searching threatening to rock her to her very  foundations. Minako wanted this to stop, something wasn’t right. She  knew eyes would be on her, but...there was a pair more intense that it  burned her from the inside, out. <em>Someone</em> was here...<em>was it her?</em></p>
<p>It  wasn’t till the sound of wheels burning on asphalt did the assault  cease. Minako tore herself from the deluge scouring the surrounding  area for the source. Lust blurred eyes pinioned on a cab, surging off  to the west. The occupant in the back at that moment, turned.</p>
<p>Storm clouded eyes met her own confused ones.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“I thought you wanted me to follow them?”</p>
<p>“A woman is allowed to change her mind,” said the miko absently.</p>
<p>Had <em>she</em> seen her?</p>
<p>Out  of rest of the already close-knit group, she and Minako had shared an  implicit bond. Rei never understood why. The priestess only knew that  whenever Aino Minako was concerned – the senshi of Mars was  impassioned, nothing <em>ever </em>made sense. Minako could make anyone feel as if they were the center of her world. But today...seeing her with <em>him</em> tore every shred of decency.</p>
<p>She  hated how he touched her, how they laughed, how they looked; she wasn’t  the secretive and anti social Minako of old – she was an entirely  different, yet captivating beast altogether, to taste that would be an  elevation to one’s soul. Jealousy reared its ugly head in her and the  miko could feel every ounce of its venom seep into her blood.</p>
<p>Rei’s  skin suddenly felt confining. She should have felt elated for her  friend. No one, save Usagi, deserved it more. Instead...the need to  make Minako feel the pain she was currently going through became  prominent.</p>
<p>“Where to now then?”, questioned the driver softly.</p>
<p>Blinking towards the rear-view Rei tensed her jaw, “Take me to my mother’s.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>With  a wave and a promise to meet them at the park, Minako had turned about  and opted to walk towards her destination. Her pace was hurried and to  the occupant within her bag – determined. A soft unzipping was heard by  the Star but paid no heed to.</p>
<p>“Minako??”</p>
<p>“It was her, I’m sure of it Artemis – just like the phonecall”, she replied curtly.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense, Mars would never...”, inferred the dirty white plush cat.</p>
<p>“She may have her reasons, I don’t know. I...I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“How do you know it <em>was</em> her?” he pressed.</p>
<p>She  rounded the corner, cutting through the promenade of a bustling  business district. A few bystanders took notice of the icon, most  remained rooted, unsure if they were seeing things or not. Minako’s  mind raced, why was the miko being so...stand-offish? Didn’t she want  to see any of them?</p>
<p><em>Didn’t she want to see me? </em></p>
<p>All throughout the day the singer felt her presence. The miko was <em>so </em>close.  A few times the Singer careened into a few bodies – offering only a  quick sorry as she hurried on her way once more. Hoping beyond hope  that her thoughts on where the miko would next be, was correct.</p>
<p>For  a long while Minako hadn’t answered – how can one explain knowing  something that only came naturally? She knew...because she <em>felt</em> her. Her fellow senshi possessed an aura that was in a league of its  own. Anyone near the miko would either feel in awe or drown from the  intensity. Minako believed that no one understood <em>her</em> as she did – they had that kind of relationship. Had. The miko was all encompassing. It was as simple as that.</p>
<p>“I...I just <em>know</em> Artemis! Stop asking me questions like that!”</p>
<p>Artemis  mroweld quietly, taken aback by Minako’s sudden outburst. He had been  surprised when Minako told him about that call but even more shocked as  she had shared her belief as to whom it was – she hadn’t told the rest  of the girls. As far as he knew, the priestess had been swallowed by  one of the four corners of the globe. It was for the best. Rei and  Minako couldn’t happen – not that Minako was <em>that type</em>. It was just...<em>odd</em>. And as much as he adored for the rest of the senshi – Minako was, <em>is</em> the only one he’ll truly <em>care</em> for – and he’ll not stand for anyone getting in the way of her  happiness. And right now, from what he witnessed at the Crown – Minako  reached that plateau that most only dream of.</p>
<p>Suddenly, his human  came to a slowing halt. Curious, the plush doll whirled about in the  bag, facing where the Singer was looking at. “...A...church?” The icon  nodded.</p>
<p>Looking along the curb, there was no cab sitting in wait  – granted, she couldn’t recall the details of what the cab may’ve  looked like, but those <em>eyes</em>. Minako had hoped. Maybe she <em>was</em> chasing absolutely <em>nothing </em>but the tendrils of her imagination.</p>
<p>Returning  to Japan from the get go began to wear on her, it truly wasn’t a  reunion without the priestess. She made her way onto the grounds  dejectedly, explaining to Artemis that this is where she and the miko  had first met. Minako wandered her way deeper into the expansive  courtyard of the Church ground before pausing before the massive oaken  doors that led straight into the heart of the chapel. Placed on its  weathered planks was a nailed notice. The interior was under  renovations of sorts. Minako gave a hollowed sigh as her hand trailed  the door’s face.</p>
<p>Each of her slender digits sunk into the aged  wooden grooves bringing with it the connection to those distant  memories. They were tied to her dream somehow – and in turn, her dream  was rooted with that of the miko.</p>
<p>Turning about the woman murmured, “...I have one more stop.”</p>
<p>“Minako...I don’t understand why...”</p>
<p><em>Why I acted like I did? Why I’m chasing when I’m not sure myself?</em></p>
<p>“...Is it really that difficult to understand that I just miss a...<em>friend </em>–  I thought it was her, keep in mind I...haven’t seen her far longer than  any of you.,” courteously injected Minako. She quickly tacked on a  reassuring smile to her long time friend. Maybe she did answer quicker  than she intended. Minako hadn’t fully comprehended why she was spurred  into reacting in such a way. But she was glad that Artemis let the  subject sink. She didn’t have answers to the <em>whys.</em> And doubted she ever will.</p>
<p>The  pavement gave way to softer ground as she continued on her silent trek.  Artemis remained quiet for the duration, having dug his way back into  the darkened pit of Minako’s bag. As he peered out from a  pre-fabricated hole in the accessory, Artemis noted that they had  traversed into the recesses of the Church. His wandering gaze was  greeted then with spokes of granite sticking up from the earth. Farther  off in a non- descript corner was a solitary Angel, chiseled from stone  stood sentry over the grounds. Flower arrangements dotted the land,  adding some color to a doldrums laced ambiance. He realized then where  they were.</p>
<p>Minako had stopped apparently they reached their  ultimate destination. A sensation of weightlessness coursed his fabric  generated being soonafter. The bag was being set aside. Curiosity got  the better of the plush guardian; so on peeking his head out he  witnessed the senshi of Love and Beauty knelt quietly before a  headstone. With gentle ease, Minako eased herself forward clearing the  debris upon the grave. Whose grave it was, Artemis wasn’t sure. He  couldn’t make out the worn carving.</p>
<p>There was one though, that had clear view and she offered a soft prayer.</p>
<p>“...I’m  sorry,” began the Star, “That we hadn’t been fated to meet. I’m almost  positive that...we would have gotten along better than your daughter  and I did,” Minako chuckled.</p>
<p>There was a lull before a gentle  wind stirred, bringing with it on its wings sounds of the leaves  overhead, laughing couples just outside the gated sanctuary and  footsteps. Made plain by the crunching of flora beneath the stranger’s  footfall. There was another paying a visit, thought Minako not  uncommon. It <em>is</em> a public domain. But..she did hope to be alone for a little while.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know stars prayed.”</p>
<p>Minako’s  back went ramrod stiff. Her fingers curled on her thighs, sending her  nails digging into the soft flesh of her palms. It was that unshakable  aura that suddenly blanketed the Singer. She felt hot. Naked. And for  the first time was unsure of what to do. But that voice, though  reasonably duskier and lower in tone belonged to the priestess. It  generated tingles from her ears to her very center. Minako’s skin  reacted eliciting forth a wave of goose pimples.</p>
<p>“Mama, gomenasai – Some people have no concept of ‘rest in peace’,” prodded the miko further.</p>
<p>Minako  couldn’t stop it even if she tried. Her cheeks flared beet. And still  no words were offered. If she uttered anything, should would have  sounded foolish.</p>
<p>“Bearing no gifts as well...Is that an American  way of thinking? Here,” Rei offered a singular red long stemmed rose  towards the Star. “The least you can give her – my mother’s favorite.”</p>
<p>A  slender hand eased forth cupping the rose gently at its base, right  beneath the velvety petals. Minako’s gaze lifted, Rei was positioned  just along her now. The miko had her eyes focused on the headstone. She  wasn’t mistaken, those eyes could never be replaced. They were dark and  stormy, dressed with long lashes and not once had they looked on her.  Rei had gotten a shade darker – but her complexion was still,  unblemished. Her hair was relaxed in a loose braid; a few stray  tendrils whisked forward with aid from the wind – it took all of  Minako’s resolve not reach out and push the errant hair away from  blocking Rei’s face.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Something had changed Rei  – something that Minako couldn’t yet pinion. One thing was certain, the  woman looked more exotic now than she was years ago.</p>
<p>Returning  her attention towards the headstone, Minako lobbed the singular rose  onto it. Breathing in, Minako picked up on the subtle trace of jasmine  in the air. It was then that she realized Rei was in close proximity.  Since when, thought the singer had Rei dabbed herself in fragrance? The  priestess rose to her feet. Minako followed suit.</p>
<p>“Am I that  below you that you won’t speak to me, Minako,” commented Rei, this time  her back was to the singer with her arms folded over the swell of her  chest.</p>
<p>Rei was taller now her frame built to suit the wiles of  the work she does. Even under the fit-to-form khaki pants and loose  mid-rift bearing top barely covered with a windbreaker, the priestess  had a feral, look to her. No longer was she in the grips of those  unforgiving teenaged years. Her thighs were firm, her belly taut – she  was <em>all</em> woman.</p>
<p>“I’m just...I’m surprised...You surprised me,” stammered Minako finally.</p>
<p>A touch of a nod was proffered. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Minako blinked in confusion, “For?”</p>
<p>“My mother. Visiting her. Her headstone was a little...dirty.”</p>
<p>“It was nothing – She was, very accommodating.”</p>
<p>“She’d have to be, Minako – she <em>is</em> dead,” truthful as they were, Rei’s words were terse, bordering angry. The songbird had wondered why.</p>
<p>“You’ve...changed,” stated Minako.</p>
<p>Rei  chuckled, shaking her head, “Mm...I sleep under the stars in sleeping  bags – while you...” the priestess listed her eyes closed, before  looking over her shoulder and meeting the Singer’s gaze evenly.  “...While you sleep with feather filled pillows, embroidered with your  initials on its coverings – We’re different.”, paused Rei, “Yes. But  changed? Will you be sicing your psychologists to confirm that? Or is  this your expert opinion...”</p>
<p><em>More infuriating, definitely, </em>voiced Minako’s inner thoughts.</p>
<p>Chocolate  played on chocolate, Minako was swallowed whole before she found Rei  within the depths of her intense pools of ruddy-brown. But that instant  was lost as Rei looked away. <em>If she wants to play...</em></p>
<p>Minako  shrugged her shoulders casually, before pivoting on a planted foot and  sniping up the handbag, sending its occupant within tumbling about.  With final respects paid to Hino Risa, the star whisked herself passed  the priestess.</p>
<p>“If you need mental assessment, fine I’ll pay for  your treatment. But...I’m already late as it stands,” the singer’s gaze  scoured Rei’s features daringly behind rosy tinted shades, “If you can  weed out which persona is more sociable – you’re welcomed to join the  rest of us. If not...” commented the singer.</p>
<p>Minako’s heart  thundered through her body. She wasn’t even sure what she said to the  priestess. One thing remained...Hino Rei was a woman that is ultimately  unknown to the icon now. She enraged the star, sending torrents of wild  emotions through her – so much that she didn’t know if she were even  standing right side up.</p>
<p><em>But you want to know her...don’t you?, </em>her mind had questioned.</p>
<p>Beyond  logic and beyond reason her heart tendered a whispered reply – if she  weren’t listening...the dark haired singer would have missed it.</p>
<p>...<em>I do. </em></p>
