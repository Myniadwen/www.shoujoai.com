<h1>Sparkling Mercury</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/rpgingmaster.html">RPGing Master</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ami was lonelier than an obscene phone caller with one dime.

Unlike other girls her age, she hadn&#39;t had much success in the dating 
department. Despite being fairly attractive, she hadn&#39;t been able to 
attract guys, unlike her friends, and she really wanted a boyfriend.

However, even though she tried to be social, her luck on the dating 
scene had plunged off the charts, and she was pretty depressed.

Thankfully, her day got a little better when Makoto called her, asking 
if she wouldn&#39;t mind a sleep over at her apartment. Without hesitation, 
Ami accepted, and barely five minutes after she had gotten off the 
phone, she had already gotten her sleepover stuff packed, and a large 
percentage of Juuban was surprised to see a blurred human shape with 
blue hair run down the street, nearly running over dogs, cats, and 
small children in her hurry...........

****************************************************************************

Makoto sighed as she hung up the phone, a smile playing across her lips 
as she thought of Ami.

Since they had met, she had taken an instant liking to her bookish 
friend and fellow Sailor Scout, and they had become really close 
friends, both of them seeming to fit together like two blocks cast from 
the same chunk of Play-Doh. Unlike her own fiery and passionate side, 
she found that Ami&#39;s subdued demeanor and cool logic proved to be a 
pleasant counter balance, and she had to confess that she liked Ami a 
lot, almost like a lover.....

Makoto&#39;s thoughts then turned to a steamier light, as she fondly 
remembered her first girlfriend, and how she had been taught the 
pleasures of the same gender, and how soft and tender her first love&#39;s 
caresses had been. Even though her lover had to move, they ended their 
relationship on good terms, and since then, she had fallen in love with 
many guys and girls, but this time seemed special, mostly because being 
in Ami&#39;s presence made her feel like the first time she had been in 
love.

However, even she was not ignorant of the facts, and not wanting to 
ruin their friendship, so she just continued to quitely lust over her 
friend......

Just then, a staccato knock at the door snapped her out of her reverie, 
and she went to the door to the quite comical sight of a breathless and 
panting Ami.

She ushered Ami in, and she went to get some refreshments while Ami 
sank into a comfy armchair and caught her breath. 

Just as Ami filled up one lung with sufficent air, Makoto brought the 
refreshments out. By the time Ami said the obligatory, &quot;Thank you&quot;, she 
was pretty much back to normal.

For a while, they just sat there, talking about school gossip and 
pretty much moaned about how school sucked and which teachers and 
faculty were unbearable.

Eventually, that discussion died aborning, and that when Makoto told 
her about her new Revolutionary Girl Utena tapes, and asked Ami if she 
wanted to pop some popcorn and enjoy a good OAV.

Ami proved willing, and both sat down on the couch, munching Kettle 
Corn as the anime played. They sat in rapt attention, their eyes unable 
to leave the screen, and it was fair to say that they got more than a 
little warm when they found themselves watching the Utena/Anthy 
lovemaking scene, and both girls unconsciously unloosened their collars 
and unbuttoned their blouses to the point that any prude would be 
offended.

After a while, the huge stack of anime tapes was spent, and that when 
Ami realized that it was a little late. Since it was a weekend, she 
went to call her mom and she asked if she could spend the night. 

To her pleased surprise, she found out that her mother had to go to a 
symposium for a few days, and to make a long story short, received 
carte blanche to stay for quite awhile.

As Ami got off the phone, she told Makoto the good news, and couldn&#39;t 
help but notice that Makoto seemed very happy she could stay, but she 
quickly set her brain to work and deduced that Makoto was probably 
lonely and needed a friend to brighten up her empty apartment for 
awhile.

Just as Ami&#39;s brain had finished it&#39;s computations, Makoto asked her if 
she was up for going to a restaurant. Ami, whose social calender was 
less impressive than most invalids, agreed instantly.

****************************************************************************

Apparently, Makoto had been squirreling away funds, and she had been 
doing an impressive job in that regard, because Ami soon found herself 
in an elegant French restaurant, and her eyes widened as saw Makoto 
order not one, but several double, and triple digit items off the menu.

Prompted by Makoto&#39;s urging, she did likewise, and she found that she 
couldn&#39;t restrain herself from pigging out, and subsequently breaking 
every rule in the book of etiquette.

Thankfully, money talks, and since Makoto was quite liberal, the staff 
and patronage was more than willing to ignore any breaches of upper 
class protocol.

In any case, after they finished their meal, they returned to the 
apartment, and that when both women realized they were in dire need of 
a bath, or a shower, owing to the rather small size of the bathroom.

Being courteous, Makoto, gave first dibs on the hot water to Ami, who 
promptly went into the furo to do her washing.

Once Ami had unclothed and showered, she was pleased to see that 
puberty, which had been rather hestiant, seemed to be catching up with 
her, and she indulged herself briefly in a rare moment of vanity.

However, that&#39;s when the polite and reserved Ami kicked in, and she 
finished quickly, so as not to waste all the hot water.

Just as she was about to leave, she felt the shower curtain opened, and 
she saw the nude form of Makoto, step in. She found herself gaping at 
Makoto for a second, her mind diverted on a completely different track 
for a few seconds. However, logic threw her a rope again, and she 
deduced that Makoto was simply trying to conserve water.

As that thought occurred to her, she still noticed she kept staring at 
Makoto, yet was not trying to be obvious about it. She was unaware that 
Makoto was doing the same.

Just then, Ami heard Makoto tenatively ask if she could scrub her back. 
She felt herself shiver unconsciously, and replied in affirmative. 
Then, she had to grit her teeth to avoid uttering a rather husky moan 
as she felt Makoto&#39;s gentle hands scrub the valley of her back with a 
rag. In fact, as the scrubbing continued, she found herself getting 
even warmer than the already hot water they were being cascaded with. 
She nearly lost her control at one point, especially when she felt 
Makoto&#39;s breasts pressed into her back once.

Soon. though, the shower concluded, and as both women left, they still 
felt warm, and it slowly dawned on them that they could barely look at 
each other without that warm feeling occuring.

However, the time grew rather late, and both realized it was time for 
sleep. Since it was so late, and Makoto hadn&#39;t caught up on her laundry 
in awhile, both women had to sleep in their birthday suits.

They both crawled into the opposite sides of the bed, feeling more than 
a little embarassed at their defrocked condition, and as Makoto turned 
off the light, they both decided not to dwell on their nudity, and they 
set about the noble goal of attaining rest.

After a few minutes, it seemed like they had suceeded, because Makoto 
soon dozed off, and Ami soon followed suit.

However, soon after Ami fell asleep, rapid REM blinks of her eyes 
occurred, and it became apparent to her nerve center that she was 
entering a dream, and a rather, ahem, erotic one at that.

She found her subconscious self in a deep mist, and as she reached a 
tenative dream hand out, she could feel a warm and delicate sensation, 
one that felt deeper than mere pleasure, in fact, it felt like she had 
dipped her hand in the nectar that had tipped Cupid&#39;s arrows.

Instantly, she reached toward the presence, and she found herself 
closer to it, discovering that there was a person on the other side, a 
person she could feel, touch, and kiss...... 
   
Suddenly, she felt the fog lift, and she stared in shock as she saw she 
was holding and kissing a naked and alluring Makoto.

As if on instinct, her eyes opened, and she found that she was placing 
gentle kisses on Makoto&#39;s neck, and her surprise turned to ashamed 
embarassment as she saw that Makoto&#39;s eyes were open, and quite aware 
of her presence.

She tried to back away, and that when she was confused to find that 
Makoto had wrapped her arms around her in a gentle embrace. Her 
confusion then reached its peak when she felt Makoto&#39;s lips pressed on 
hers in an intimate kiss.

Even though she was still surprised, she found herself returning the 
kiss, and her body shuddered with more pleasant sensations, even more 
than she had experienced in her dreams as she wrapped her arms around 
Makoto and lay there caught up in mutual passion with the woman she 
realized that she had long lusted over, and she simply lay there and 
kissed her friend and lover back, drinking in the passion like water 
for a man dying of thirst.

Just then, she felt Makoto&#39;s fingers, which had been firmly holding on 
to her back, trace a cool line down her warm flesh, down to the swell 
of her behind.

Then, she felt her lover start to kiss lower and lower, dipping into 
the hollow of her throat, then descending into the valley of her 
breasts, then making a trail down her stomach, and then going even 
lower, down to her most secret spot.

Ami soon started moaning, for Makoto had started to swirl her tongue 
against the inner walls of her sex, lavishing her well of desire with 
her silken tongue, which occasionally flicked across the nubbin of her 
clitoris, causing her unprecedented amounts of pleasure, giving her 
more satisfaction than any steamy midnight fantasy ever had, or would.

As Makoto continued her ministrations, Ami felt as if the excitement 
and release of her pent up lust would drive her insane. In an act of 
desperation, she held Makoto&#39;s head in her hands and pushed it inward, 
giving her lover access to all of her secret spots.

As she did, she felt her lover&#39;s tempo increase, and she felt the low 
boil in her loins reach it&#39;s breaking point, and she felt her nectar 
flow into her lover&#39;s eager mouth.

As she shook from the aftershocks of climax, she felt Makoto&#39;s toned 
body shimmy up to where they were face to face again, and she could she 
a beautific smile cross Makoto&#39;s face as she continued her earlier 
round of sweet, passionate kisses.

Makoto had lost herself in the pleasure, as they continued to make 
themselves one, uncaring of the world&#39;s opinion. In fact, the pleasure 
did not end, even as they fell asleep in each other&#39;s arms...


The next morning...


It was a bright Saturday morning, one in which the birds chirped, the 
flowers unfurled in bloom, and true love blossomed. The sun cast a 
gentle beam of light through the windows, and it gave it&#39;s shining 
blessing on the two women who lay there, safe and secure in their love 
for each other, and it seemed that nothing could shake the bonds of 
affection that had been laid upon their hearts...

The End

Author&#39;s Note: This is my first tasteful lemon, my first story that 
didn&#39;t involve any use of swear words, or crude descriptions of sexual 
acts, and I must say I&#39;m pretty pleased with the way this turned out.

By the way, even though I have written, ahem, alternative lifestyle 
pairings, I personally do not advocate such liasons, yet I am loath to 
judge those who choose that path. Also, while I believe it is morally 
wrong, I realize, unlike certain people I will not name, that real life 
is not as rosy a picture as some would like to paint it, and male\male 
and female\female relations not only occur, but sometimes work out 
better than male\female relations.

On another note, to my fans, and even to my detractors:

Have a nice day!!!!!!!!
