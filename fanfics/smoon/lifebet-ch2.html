<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 2 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>- I have a sister? Not possible&#133;maybe, but I would have known if I had 
a sister. Maybe during the Silver Millennium? But why haven&#146;t the 
memories surfaced?- Darien was thinking this as he drove himself and 
the girls to his &#146;sister&#146;s&#146; mansion. He was sure the girls were 
thinking the same thing. Darien was definitely sure everyone had 
questions and &#146;Terri&#146; was prepared to answer.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147; Terres&#133;I mean Terri, they have just arrived.&#148; Menia called from the 
other side of Terri&#146;s door. She heard a crash, a yelp, and finally the 
young Princess dashing out the door to the entrance room. Menia 
giggled and followed her.

When Terri went downstairs she saw her brother and the other girls 
waiting. Terri ran and hugged Darien, burring her face in his broad 
face. She stepped back understanding he needed oxygen. 

&#147; I&#146;m sorry, but it&#146;s been so long!&#148; Terri giggled as she watched him 
suck in air.

&#147; Follow me, Nara will take your bags to your rooms.&#148; They did as 
ordered and followed Terri to the living room. Everyone panned out and 
sat down. 

&#147; All right, explain yourself. How are you Darien&#146; s sister?&#148; Serena 
asked flat out.

&#147; Well first off I AM his sister. For you to believe me I must give 
you back your memories.&#148; Terri heard a collective gasp, but Rei just 
looked on.

&#147; Darien come stand in front of me please.&#148; Darien did as told. When 
he was in position, Terri raised her hand. Putting one finger on his 
forehead. Then the sign of Earth showed on his head. Terri focused her 
energy, murmured something, then with in 5 seconds, Darien had her in 
a tight hug. The girls took this as a good sign. When the two broke 
apart, you could see both were on the verge of crying. With a cheshire 
grin, Darien went behind Terri and put his hands on her shoulders.

&#147; Scouts, I would like you to meet my sister Terrestria. Princess of 
the planet Terrestrial.&#148; the two looked at the shocked faces. Darien 
then sat back down.

&#147; Girls, please come stand in a circle around me.&#148; Still shocked, they 
stood around her. Terri glowed in a periwinkle color. Her hands in gun 
style pointing up. The signs of their planets glowing and a wind 
passed by them. Terri turned to look at Rei. They&#146;re eyes 
communicating a secret message. Everyone sat back down. 

&#147; I still don&#146;t get it. I have no memory of you at all.&#148; Mina&#146;s 
confusion showing.

&#147; Let me explain, just don&#146;t interrupt. When I was born, a planet was 
born with me. My home planet Terrestrial. This was because of Gia&#146;s 
plan to reincarnate her powers. I was never meant to be a princess of 
Earth. I was also hidden from the planets except for my family and 
selected staff. I have Gia&#146;s powers, making me the most powerful being 
in existence. I was to live on Earth for my child years. Then when I 
turned 13, I would go to Terrestrial for training. That time was when 
Queen Beryl attacked.&#148; Terri looked at the shocked faces of Mina, 
Lita, Ami, and Serena.

She then continued.

&#147; Yes I am stronger than Serenity. When you were sent to Earth for 
peaceful lives, my brother never got to finish his training. My 
mission was to then find him and bring him with me back to Terrestrial 
to train. Endymion&#146;s skills to be king will not come naturally.&#148; Terri 
finished looking at the same shocked four faces.

&#147; That&#145;s impossible! How are you stronger than me?&#148; 

&#147; I will show you tomorrow. Now if you&#146;ll follow me, I will show you 
to your rooms. There you can unpack and decide what to do until 
dinner.&#148;

They followed her in silence, obviously thinking. They stopped at two 
hallways. Five doors in each. Every door a different color. 

&#147; I&#146;m sure you can tell who&#146;s room is who&#146;s. Serenity and Endymion I 
have given you one room. My room is at the end of the other hallway. 
I&#146;ll meet you down stairs in&#133;20 minutes.&#148; Terri then left them and 
went to her own room.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Who are the other four rooms for?- Rei wondered this as she went to 
the red door. Surprised to see her sign etched in. She walked in. - Oh 
my god.- Rei sucked in breath. The room was beautiful! Every shade of 
red there ever was, was in this room. The four poster bed, 
surprisingly had light lavender curtains. - Most likely do to my bow- 
As she looked around, it looked very familiar. - I know this room&#133;it&#146;s 
my bedroom! The one from the Silver Millennium!- From the carpeting to 
the phoenix chandelier. -Amazing!- Rei finished her packing, changed 
into her crimson red bikini and went to meet the others. She knew 
they&#146;d be at the pool.

Instinct was right. When Rei arrived she found Lita, Mina, and Ami 
playing Marko-Polo. They looked up, their eyes also looking behind 
her. Rei knew what was behind her. She slowly turned around. There was 
Serena, in all her beauty. Wearing a pure white bikini, which 
unfortunately showed all her curves perfectly. It didn&#146;t help that she 
was latched onto Darien&#146;s arm.

- Oh god! I can&#146;t stay here!- Rei fled then, running passed Terri and 
into the weight room. Lita, Ami, and Mina went after her. Telling 
Serena to stay. Serena understood and started talking to Terri.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147; Oh god, oh god, oh god. Damn it!&#148; Rei gave the punching bag a high 
kick.

&#147; Rei?&#148; There stood 3 of here best friends, sympathy on their faces. 
The Fire Goddess collapsed then. Her cheeks starting to stain with 
tears. The others went to her side. 

&#147; Rei I know you don&#146;t wanna hear this but, you gotta let her go. 
There will be another love, I&#146;m sure!&#148; Mina tried to get her to stop 
crying. 

&#147; Oh I&#146;ll stop crying eventually. I&#146;m really just crying cuz I hit my 
head so hard on that pole.&#148; This got a laugh from her friends.

&#147; Besides if another love comes along, I&#146;m betting they won&#146;t be 
immortal. That&#146;s not going to last and will just cause more pain&#133;.&#148; 
Just then Terri, Serena,&amp; Darien walked in. &#147; What will cause pain?&#148; 
Serena looked at Rei&#146;s tear stained face.

&#147; Oh I just hit my head on that bar and Lita offered a cure.&#148; The 
three bought it and everyone split up.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

&#147; So dear sister how&#146;s your training?&#148; Darien looked at his sister.

&#147; Oh it&#146;s complete. I just have to keep in shape now.&#148;

&#147; So soon&#133;.but here your only 18!&#148;

&#147; Endymion, do not forget that I am a prot&eacute;g&eacute;e. I have my mother&#146;s 
powers so I can help to rule the Universe properly when the time 
comes.&#148;

&#147; Your mother? Terrestria our mother didn&#146;t have that power.&#148;

&#147; Gia is as much my mother as the one we share.&#148;

&#147; Terrestria does this mean you are still important?&#148;

&#147; Of course I&#146;m important! We all are!&#148;

&#147; You know what I mean, when the battle begins, will they take you?&#148;

&#147; I don&#146;t know what your talking about. It&#146;s time to dress for dinner. 
Let&#146;s get the others.&#148;

There was silence on the walk back to the mansion. They met their 
friends at the base of the stairs.

&#147; OK people, you have an hour to get ready. When you get back to your 
rooms there will be a new closet. Inside is a gift from me. I&#146;ll see 
you in a hour.&#148; Terri then went to her room.</pre>
