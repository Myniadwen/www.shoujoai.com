<h1>Paralyzed (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/atara.html">Atara</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/paralyzed-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Makoto lazily rolled over as the warm sun drew her from sleep. She 
stretched languidly, and made a small noise of surprise as her arm 
bumped into something more solid than her pillows. Feeling the heat of a 
blush creeping up over her cheeks, she turned to the side and smiled as 
her eyes settled on the blond curled on her side next to her. Minako was 
still sound asleep, her blond hair draped over her shoulder, some 
hanging off the side of the bed. She was holding a pillow tight to her 
chest, and Makoto found herself envious of the object. Makoto reached 
up, gently brushing her fingertips over Minako&#39;s cheek and lightly 
through her hair, then let her eyes close as she remembered the last 
night.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Oto-chan?&quot; Minako murmured softly, her voice muffled a little as she 
had her cheek pressed to Makoto&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Hum?&quot; Makoto smiled at the nickname Minako had labeled her with in the 
last few hours. She kept her arms wrapped about the shorter girl, 
swaying slowly in time with the music. They had been dancing, well, more 
like enjoying each others closeness, for the last hour.

&quot;Am I awake? You really share the same feelings for me?&quot; Minako lifted 
her head from Makoto&#39;s shoulder, her blue eyes searching for Makoto&#39;s.

When her bright green eyes met the sky blue, Makoto found her breath 
stolen from her for a few moments before the question fully registered 
in her mind. Smiling, she leaned her head down to brush her lips over 
Minako&#39;s forehead, brushing a bit of blond bangs from the other girl&#39;s 
forehead. &quot;You&#39;re awake, and yes, I do.&quot; She tilted her head slightly, 
raising one hand to cup Minako&#39;s cheek. &quot;I think...remembering when you 
first joined us so long ago, I started feeling it then. You just dazzled 
us, my beautiful Venus, and started to steal my heart away that very 
day. Didn&#39;t you notice how I made a point to get to know you, to hang 
around with you more, and be around you? You drew me to you. I dont 
think I could ever hope to put to words just how happy I am right now, 
or how it felt when you said those three little words...&quot; Makoto trailed 
off as she felt her throat tighten with the emotion welling up inside.

Minako&#39;s eyes shone with such a bright inner light as Makoto spoke that 
Makoto imagined her glowing, and she smiled one of those radiant smiles 
that made the taller girl get a little thrill down her spine. Her cheeks 
colored slightly, and she glanced down. &quot;I might end up asking you that 
a lot for a while. I try not to! But its just..&quot;

Makoto silenced Minako with a light kiss. &quot;Shh. It&#39;s okay, I understand. 
You can ask me as much as you want, but you needn&#39;t worry, because I&#39;ll 
be telling you every day.&quot;

Minako continued to smile, letting her eyes drift closed as she leaned 
forward to rest her cheek to Makoto&#39;s shoulder again. A comfortable 
silence fell over the two of them as the cd skipped back to the 
beginning. Makoto eyed the clock for a moment as she kept moving with 
Minako to the music, then slipped her hands down along the blond&#39;s arms, 
taking a hold of Minako&#39;s hand as she looked up questioningly. Makoto 
tilted her head towards the kitchen and lead Minako towards it.

&quot;Thought we could take a little break, get something light to eat?&quot; She 
blushed as she heard her stomach rumble, remembering that she hadn&#39;t 
eaten much before getting ready to go to the club. Minako eyed Makoto&#39;s 
stomach, and laughed lightly.

&quot;That sounds like a good idea. I think your stomach agrees!&quot; Minako 
giggled and slipped onto one of the barstools that lined the little 
island in Makoto&#39;s modest sized kitchen. She blushed as her own stomach 
grumbled, and Makoto grinned, raising an eyebrow.

&quot;Did you eat before getting so stunningly dressed to dazzle me?&quot; Makoto 
peered into the fridge.

&quot;Actually, no. Katrina called, then I noticed that we talked way to long 
and I had to rush about a bit to finish getting ready. I intended on 
showing up later to sort of scope things out and see what you guys were 
up to. I was going to have a light dinner, but was just so distracted 
with the phone.&quot;

&quot;Oh, she was the call you were waiting for?&quot; Makoto asked, pulling out a 
few things from the fridge.

Minako nodded. &quot;With the time difference between here and there, we have 
to plan times to call and talk with each other. Set up two times today, 
she missed the first, but was able to get the second.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;s she doing?&quot; Makoto brought over two plates with rice balls and 
light sandwiches, getting two glasses of ice water.

Minako took a moment to take a bite of the sandwich before answering. 
&quot;She&#39;s doing well, got a promotion this month, and Alan&#39;s a little 
stressed with his studies but apparently doing good in classes.&quot; She 
smiled, and Makoto tilted her head slightly. She expected to see the 
usual sadness in Minako&#39;s eyes that usually came along with when she 
spoke of the people back in England, but realized that it was nowhere to 
be found, and found herself smiling as she realized it was a fair bet 
that she was the reason that sadness had gone away. Minako blinked, and 
laughed. &quot;That&#39;s a bit of a goofy smile Oto-chan.&quot;

Makoto leaned against the counter, taking a bite from a rice ball before 
taking a drink. &quot;Is it? Well, I&#39;m just...I&#39;m just really happy, 
Mina-koi.&quot;

Minako beamed, a bit of red coloring her cheeks. &quot;Me too.&quot;

Leaning forward over the counter, Makoto brushed her lips over Minako&#39;s 
forehead, and gathered up the now empty plates, setting them in the 
sink. Turning, she was about to suggest putting in a movie when she 
caught the tail end of Minako&#39;s yawn, and chuckled. &quot;Sleepy?&quot;

Nodding, Minako stretched her arms up over her head again, a move that 
Makoto suspected she&#39;d become quite fond of. &quot;I&#39;m in a lazy mode. I&#39;m a 
little peeved at Katrina for not calling this morning when she said she 
would, got up early for it and everything.&quot;

Makoto slipped her hand into Minako&#39;s and led her back into the living 
room. &quot;Ah, that&#39;s why you were early coming here.&quot;

Minako nodded again as she waited for Makoto to sit, then promptly 
slipped into the taller girl&#39;s lap, Makoto automatically settling her 
arms around Minako&#39;s waist. &quot;Yeah. And didn&#39;t you notice, I always 
jumped at the opportunity to get you alone as much as I can. Now you&#39;re 
mine.&quot; She leaned back, nuzzling her cheek to Makoto&#39;s, smiling at the 
touch of heat she felt against her skin.

&quot;Well, yeah, I did notice.&quot; Makoto paused. &quot;Okay, so I didn&#39;t always 
notice, but in retrospect, yeah, I did. I thought I was just lucky to 
get the extra time spent with you.&quot;

Minako inhaled Makoto&#39;s scent, nuzzling into the crook of her neck. &quot;Was 
also an excuse to bring my stuff over and hide it under your bed when 
you weren&#39;t looking.&quot;

Makoto laughed. &quot;You did?&quot; Minako nodded, and Makoto laughed again. &quot;You 
sneak!&quot;

Grinning, Minako lightly nipped at Makoto&#39;s shoulder, smiling a little 
smugly as she felt Makoto shiver. &quot;I&#39;ve been planning this for a while, 
you know. It didn&#39;t feel right to tell you just on some regular day, and 
I feel that I might have said things too fast now even, like I should 
have been more romantic or something, like Im not living up to my 
heritage.&quot;

Drawing her hand up along Minako&#39;s side, Makoto played her fingers 
through the long strands of blond hair. &quot;I think I&#39;ll look back on this 
day as being perfect, Minako. You dont need to do fancy things to 
capture my heart, you already won it.&quot;

Minako giggled softly. &quot;Maybe, but still. I&#39;ll make it up to you.&quot;

Makoto leaned her head forward, closing her eyes and pressed her face to 
Minako&#39;s hair, inhaling the scent of strawberries that she was so 
familiar with. &quot;Alright.&quot; She shivered softly as Minako started to play 
her lips along her shoulder, shifting so she was facing Makoto a bit 
more.

Tightening her hold around Minako&#39;s waist, Makoto turned her head and 
captured the blonds&#39; ear between her lips, smirking at the surprised 
gasp that won her, followed by a soft moan. The sound sent a shockwave 
through Makoto, and she pulled her head back, silencing the question 
forming on Minako&#39;s lips with a firm, demanding kiss that coaxed another 
light moan from Minako, who quickly yielded to the touch.

Makoto had never felt so alive. Something akin to the feeling she would 
get when transforming was racing through her, the closeness to Minako 
was intoxicating, and she realized in the back of her mind, addicting 
too. It was powerful, and borderline frightening, but it sure the hell 
wasn&#39;t going to stop her. She kept up the kiss, her hand tangled in 
Minako&#39;s hair, her body tingling where Minako&#39;s hands were on her 
shoulders. Eventually, Minako broke the kiss when the need for air 
overwhelmed their higher endurance levels, her lips red and a little 
bruised from the pressure, a sight the Jovian senshi found damn sexy. 
Wrapping her arms tightly around Makoto&#39;s shoulders, Minako buried her 
face in the other girl&#39;s neck, and held on as if she were drowning, 
Makoto keeping tight hold of her as well. Without saying anything, 
Makoto slipped her arms down, one below Minako&#39;s knees and the other 
behind her lower back, easily lifting her as she stood. Pushing the 
power button on the stereo with her elbow, she carried Minako down the 
hall and into the bedroom, kicking the door shut with her heel.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nothing &#39;risqu&eacute;&#39; happened after that, more kissing and simply holding 
each other close. Eventually, Minako&#39;s tiredness won out and the two 
changed into nightclothes, Minako being a bit teasing on her way into 
the bathroom to change, something that set Makoto&#39;s blood on fire, but 
she mentally kicked it back down. Sleep claimed them both, and now as 
the sun insisted, Makoto was wide-awake and lost in her thoughts as she 
just watched Minako sleep. A muffled beep from her watch drew Makoto out 
of her revere, and she yawned again, stretching her arms up over her 
head as she looked about for a clock.

&quot;Ten already? Dang.&quot; She murmured to herself as she slipped from under 
the covers. &quot;Well, we did stay up late.&quot; Reaching for a scrunchie, she 
pulled her hair back in a hasty ponytail and wandered out into the 
living room. Noticing a little blinking light on her answering machine, 
she blinked. &quot;I didn&#39;t even hear the phone...&quot; Reaching over, she 
pressed play.

&#39;Hey Mako-chan! Wanted to let you and Minako-chan know that we&#39;ve been 
invited over to Haruka and Michiru&#39;s tonight for a cookout. Hope last 
night went well! What Rei-chan?&#39; Rei&#39;s muffled voice was heard in the 
background, something about wondering how Usagi knew where Minako was, 
Usagi giggling in response. &#39;I just know, call it princess intuition. 
What? Hey! Ack!&#39; There was a bit of rustling before a series of beeps, 
likely someone falling onto the phone as Makoto assumed that Rei threw 
something at Usagi for being evasive with her answer, and the phone 
clicked off. Usagi&#39;s voice was way to chipper for the time-stamp on the 
message, and Makoto laughed when she noticed that the caller id was from 
the temple instead of Usagi&#39;s home, and figured the others must have 
gone there after the club. Knowing Rei, she wouldn&#39;t let Usagi sleep 
beyond eight if she had things to do, a little before the call was.

Picking up the cordless, she wandered into the kitchen while hitting the 
buttons out of memory. Propping it up with her shoulder, she started 
pulling out ingredients and utencils, listening to the phone ring. Four 
rings later, Makoto was getting ready to talk to the answering machine 
when it was picked up.

&quot;Moshi Moshi?&quot; Rei answered, sounding a little breathless.

&quot;Ohayo Rei-chan! You guy&#39;s called?&quot;

&quot;Ohayo Mako-chan. Yeah, Usagi did before she and Ami left, hope she 
didn&#39;t wake you up.&quot;

&quot;No, no worries. She did, however, forget to tell me when we&#39;re supposed 
to be at Haruka and Michiru&#39;s.&quot; She cursed faintly under her breath as 
she dropped a pan in the sink, making a bit of a clatter. She glanced 
down the hall at the bedroom where she could still see Minako on the 
bed, who didn&#39;t move in response to the sound.

&quot;Ack, what was that sound? And I think Michiru said that food would be 
done around six, but we could head over early and use the pool if we 
wanted. I plan on heading there around three thirty myself, get there 
before four. I love their pool.&quot;

&quot;Just dropped a pan, sorry. Oh, cool, okay, that gives me plenty of time 
to get something together. Think I need to hit the store for some 
things. Should I bring a salad, or dessert?&quot;

&quot;Why are you asking that? We both know you&#39;ll bring both.&quot;

Makoto laughed. &quot;True, I guess. Hum, maybe I&#39;ll do salads and make a 
fruit salad for after...&quot; She trailed off while thinking, starting to 
mix together some batter.

&quot;Remember that Hotaru&#39;s allergic to watermelon if you do that.&quot;

&quot;I remember. I have a list of things that everyone&#39;s allergic to taped 
inside one of my cabinets so I remember. And Minako doesn&#39;t like it 
anyway, so...okay, cake it is then...&quot;

Rei laughed. &quot;You have a list? Well, I shouldn&#39;t be surprised at that. 
Oh, speaking of Minako, where did you two disappear to last night? She 
was all excited to go to the club and ends up showing up late, and I saw 
you two dancing, but then you were gone after like only an hour and she 
didn&#39;t even stop to say hi to us. Everything okay?&quot;

Makoto chuckled as she flipped a few pancakes. &quot;Much, much more than 
just okay.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot;

Makoto paused. While she was fairly certain that they&#39;d not have any 
issues with it, seeing as how everyone accepted Haruka and Michiru, she 
didn&#39;t know how she and Minako would go about telling their friends. 
Haruka and Michiru could see it, and Usagi seemed to know already in 
that sort of creepy way she had of knowing a person&#39;s true feelings, but 
Ami and Rei were clueless, as far as she knew. Plus, she didn&#39;t know is 
Minako would want to say anything yet. So, she lied, cringing to herself 
the entire time and thinking of a way to apologize to Rei later. &quot;I was 
getting uncomfortable there and Minako dragged me out to get away from 
it before I could say goodbye, and we ended up watching movies here.&quot;

&quot;Ah, Usagi guessed that Minako was there. You&#39;re alright then?&quot; She 
could hear the slight disbelief in Rei&#39;s voice, but the priestess didn&#39;t 
seem angry, likely assumed she&#39;d find out in due time.

&quot;Yeah, I&#39;m fine. So, you&#39;re heading there around three thirty? Mind if I 
call you around three if things are set here so we can head out with 
you?&quot;

&quot;Sure, call, and I&#39;ll head to your place. The bus from here is a bit of 
a round about, the one from your building is more of a direct route 
there.&quot; Makoto heard Rei opening a door. &quot;Oop, I gotta run. Talk to you 
later!&quot; She hung up before Makoto could reply, and with a light shrug, 
she hung up and set the phone on the counter. The back of her neck 
tingled and she frowned slightly, confused at the feeling before she was 
distracted by the feeling of a slender pair of arms slipping about her 
waist, and Minako nuzzling against her back with a sleepy murmur of 
&#39;good morning&#39;.

Makoto &#39;murred&#39; and wiggled a little against Minako&#39;s embrace. &quot;Good 
morning Mina-koi.&quot;

&quot;Mmmf.&quot;

&quot;Sleep well?&quot;

&quot;Mmfrgl.&quot; This was accompanied by a slight nod against Makoto&#39;s 
shoulders and a tightening of embrace.

&quot;Usagi called, we&#39;ve been invited to Haruka and Michiru&#39;s today for a 
cookout.&quot;

&quot;Mmf.&quot;

&quot;Had to call Rei and find out exactly when, since Usagi forgot to 
mention that little detail. Rei plans on heading over there around three 
thirty, I told her that I&#39;d call her around three if we were set and the 
three of us could go together.&quot;

&quot;Mmhum.&quot;

&quot;After breakfast we can head to the store and get some ingredients for 
the salad I&#39;m planning, and I figure I could make a cake too.&quot; She 
started a few pieces of bacon cooking after flipping the last of the 
pancakes.

Minako disengaged herself from Makoto&#39;s back and settled on a bar stool, 
her yawn quite audible. &quot;Sounds like a plan. I should call Mom and let 
her know...&quot; She yawned again, leaning back on the bar stool and 
stretching her arms to her sides. Makoto turned and had to laugh at her 
first sight of Minako. Her hair was a bit tousled, Makoto realizing that 
there would be a slight wave to Minako&#39;s hair if it weren&#39;t so long, and 
half of her hair was draped over her face. Her once smoothed out 
nightshirt was all wrinkled, and Minako looked as if she were still 
really more asleep than anything. Makoto&#39;s laugh had brought a slight 
blush to Minako&#39;s face, which just made the blond look all that more 
adorable.

&quot;Here, set the table and get out the juice, please?&quot; Makoto set two 
plates in front of Minako, knowing that she knew where the rest of the 
needed objects were. &quot;I hope I didn&#39;t wake you up when I dropped the 
pan.&quot;

&quot;Hum? Oh, no, but the smell of food did.&quot; Minako took the plates and 
seemed to debate how she wanted to set them on the table, first putting 
them side by side, then settling for across from each other before she 
went to get the cups and silverware. Makoto caught a glance of Minako&#39;s 
expression, and frowned slightly when she noticed how serious the girl 
looked.

&quot;Something wrong? You like orange juice, don&#39;t you?&quot; Makoto turned and 
watched Minako, wracking her mind to remember if she liked orange juice 
or not.

Minako blinked, and laughed softly. &quot;Yes, I do. And, well...&quot; She let 
out a slow breath. &quot;I&#39;m just wondering how to talk to Rei and Ami about, 
well, us.&quot; She turned and leaned against the counter once she finished 
setting the table.

Makoto made a sort of &#39;oh&#39; face and nodded, turning to finish with the 
bacon. &quot;I was wondering that myself. I don&#39;t expect them to freak out or 
anything, but, the thought of going &#39;Hey, guys, I&#39;m going out with 
Minako now&#39; seems a little, weird. Michiru knew last night, and told me 
to relax and trust you, and I guess Haruka said something similar to 
you, huh?&quot; She turned and carried the plate of pancakes and bacon to the 
table, pulling out Minako&#39;s chair for her.

Nodding, Minako sat down. &quot;I, well, I had actually talked with them 
about asking you when I asked them if they wanted to come to the club. I 
think they mostly came for support, honestly, since I hinted I wanted to 
talk to you about it last night...&quot; Minako blushed again, and Makoto 
smiled, leaning down and giving her a kiss to the cheek before sitting 
down herself.

&quot;I wonder if they thought to invite everyone over for a cookout to give 
us the chance to say something to everyone?&quot; Makoto mused, serving 
Minako and then herself.

Furrowing her brow a little, Minako drifted into quiet thought for a 
moment. &quot;Maybe. Though really, Haruka had mentioned it as an alternative 
to the club because they got a new grill and she wanted to try it.&quot; 
Minako laughed. &quot;Back up plan in case I couldn&#39;t talk to you last 
night?&quot;

Makoto laughed. &quot;Maybe so. I should make a cherry pie for them as a 
thank you.&quot;

Minako giggled and literally soaked her pancakes in syrup. &quot;Well, I 
don&#39;t think we should worry about what to say to Ami and Rei, they&#39;ll 
understand. I might hear it from Rei for not saying anything to her 
before this, though.&quot; Minako cringed a little and Makoto giggled. Though 
she and Minako had been close before, Minako and Rei were most assuredly 
best friends on a different level from what they were, much like how she 
and Ami were. The fire senshi and senshi of love just seemed to read 
each other on a different level, one that if it had been anyone other 
than Rei, Makoto would be jealous.

&quot;Okay, I&#39;ll make Rei a cake too then.&quot; Makoto chuckled. &quot;Oh, or we can 
pick up stuff for cookies, you can manage those.&quot;

Minako mock-pouted and tried to look wounded. &quot;I can &#39;manage&#39; those? Are 
you saying I&#39;m no good in the kitchen?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

Minako threw her napkin at Makoto and the two laughed, finishing soon 
there after. As Minako claimed the shower first, Makoto cleaned up the 
dishes, thankful that it didn&#39;t affect the temperature of the shower, 
and wandered around her apartment, watering the copious amounts of 
plants she had all over. She blinked as she heard a scratching noise, 
glancing towards the kitchen.

&quot;Oh, I hope I don&#39;t have mice...&quot; She started towards the kitchen to 
investigate, when she spied the source of the sound, a white cat was 
sitting on her windowsill, giving her a pitiful look. She laughed and 
slid the window open, and lifted the screen up, letting the cat in. 
&quot;Good morning Artemis.&quot;

&quot;Good morning!&quot; The white cat rubbed against Makoto&#39;s legs, then jumped 
up onto a stool, and stretched. &quot;Thanks for letting me in.&quot;

&quot;No problem. How&#39;re you today?&quot; Makoto went back to tending her plants, 
plucking a few brown leaves from one.

&quot;Minako&#39;s mother kicked me out after I accidentally knocked over a stack 
of papers. You&#39;d think it was the end of the world or something.&quot; He 
rolled his blue eyes and curled his tail around his legs. &quot;Where&#39;s 
Minako?&quot;

Makoto thumbed towards the hallway and bathroom, smirking as Minako 
chose that moment to start singing in the shower. While Minako had a 
beautiful voice, and had proven it several times in idol competitions, 
she somehow still managed to sound horrid in the shower. Artemis 
chuckled. &quot;Im going in when she&#39;s done, then we&#39;re going to go shopping 
for some food things to make to bring to Haruka and Michiru&#39;s. You going 
to tag along with?&quot;

Artemis shook his head. &quot;Nah, Luna wanted to get together tonight, and 
who am I to say no to her?&quot; He grinned, and Makoto rubbed behind his 
ears.

&quot;Alright. Hum. We should pick up some things for you while out too; I 
think Minako&#39;ll be here more often. Or at least, I hope she will be.&quot; 
She smiled, and blushed faintly when the cat gave her a look, then 
perked his ears.

&quot;She finally told you, huh?&quot; He smiled when Makoto nodded. &quot;Good, good.&quot; 
He looked rather pleased and hopped down from the chair, and started 
heading into the living room. &quot;Might as well finally explore the rest of 
your apartment other than the kitchen!&quot;

Makoto laughed and tossed away the bits of plant debris, and continued 
to putter about. Minako finally emerged from the bathroom, a cloud of 
steam pouring out behind her, and Makoto went in to shower shortly 
after, hearing Minako starting to talk to Artemis when she found him in 
the living room. Soon, they were saying goodbye to the white cat and 
heading down the road to the little market Makoto frequented, gathering 
together the needed things for the planned salad and deserts, along with 
a few other essentials. Minako raised an eyebrow when Makoto picked up a 
few cat supplies, and when Makoto blushingly explained, she laughed and 
put them into her own basket, saying it was her cat, she should take 
care of it. Cooking was uneventful, Minako managing to not burn anything 
or herself, and soon they found themselves lounging around the apartment 
and waiting for Rei.

Minako wandered into the bedroom to change into her swimsuit, leaving 
Makoto in the living room with Artemis settled on the arm of the sofa. 
She listened to Minako hum, smiling at how everything just felt so...so 
right. A light knock at the door announced Rei&#39;s arrival, and Makoto 
stood to open the door and let her in.

Just as the door swung open, and Makoto was about to greet the smiling 
girl on the other side of it, Minako walked down the hallway, distracted 
with her hairbow as she spoke. &quot;How are we going to tell Rei?&quot;

Makoto felt her stomach twist into a knot, her eyes widening a little as 
Rei blinked, and arched a slender eyebrow. Stepping into the apartment, 
she slipped off her shoes, watching Minako as the blond noticed her, and 
froze in place.

&quot;Tell me what?&quot;
