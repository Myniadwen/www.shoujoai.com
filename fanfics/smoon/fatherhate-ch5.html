<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A gentle breeze tickled her nose, carrying the scent of sakura blossoms and honey.</span></p>
</span>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei moaned and opened her eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pastel colors of a magical sunset greeted her, the pinks and yellows  and oranges making her head spin. Impossibly soft grass cushioned her  body, and, briefly, the smell of lilacs teased her senses.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Paradise was the first word that came to her mind. Heaven was the second.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Am I dead?” she murmured to no one at all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No,  Otome. You are merely…in between…” Rei jumped, and cast her gaze to see  the gorgeous woman whose lap her head was resting on. She was stunning,  with brown hair that cascaded to the ground and drifted across her  slender shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Who are you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman chuckled,  before she trailed a gentle hand across Rei’s right cheek, still tender  from when her father had struck it. A sad look passed through the  woman’s amethyst orbs—</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Wait…amethyst? Rei’s eyes widened and she felt the familiar prick of tears at the edges.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“H-Hahaoya?”  the miko stammered. The woman, her mother, gave a watery smiled and  leaned down to press a tender kiss on Rei’s forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hai, my  little Rei-chan…” Rei smiled, a true, happy smile and hiccupped before  she sat up and willingly went into her mother’s open arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hahaoya,”  she whispered, “Hahaoya…” Her mother merely tucked Rei’s head  underneath her chin and smiled into her daughter’s ebony colored hair.  Rei cried, but not out of pain or sorrow or guilt, like she had done  before. Happiness trickled from her eyes, and she knew that they would  sting a bit afterwards, but the reincarnated princess of Mars didn’t  really give a damn.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My little Rei-chan,” Her mother whispered, “I’m so proud of you. My little Senshi.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei stiffened. “H-how—“ Oh. Right. Her mother was dead…and maybe she was too…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-chan,  I’m so sorry.” Rei blinked and pulled away, noticing that her mother  was in tears as well. Never really good at the whole, comforting thing,  she did what she had seen Usagi do before and cupped her mother’s face  in her hands, wiping away the tears with her thumbs.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What for Hahaoya?” she whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“If  I’d only tried a little harder to…then Takeda wouldn’t be so…it’s all  my fault!” Her mother wailed. Rei froze, then she hugged her mother and  began to rock back and forth, slowly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This was Destiny’s doing  Hahaoya,” she cooed. “It was supposed to happen. And…if I hadn’t been  sent to Grandfather’s…I wouldn’t have met my friends.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But you wouldn’t have had to go through what you—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Without  pain, there is no pleasure,” Rei interrupted. “Without sorrow, there is  no joy. Without hate, there can be no love. Yes, it was hard. I won’t  lie to myself, or you, and say that it was just a little bumpy, when it  was like crawling on thumbtacks naked.” Her mother blinked at her  daughter’s odd analogy. “But then I met Usagi-chan and  Ami-chan…Mako-chan and Minako-chan…Chibi-chan and Setsuna-san…Haruka,  Michiru and Hotaru-chan…and Mamoru-san. They’ve all helped me <em>live</em> Hahaoya.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>Some</em> more than others.” Rei’s mother said with a knowing wink. Rei blushed  and tossed her head to the side and grumbled an affirmative. Mother and  daughter continued to cuddle, the warmth that Rei had never had  surrounding her and making her smile.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can’t stay Rei-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sad declaration brought Rei out of her thoughts. “What?” she stuttered. “I’m dead aren’t I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh  no Otome. You’re not. As I said before, you are merely in the space  between. Your body’s alive and well but your soul is in danger. Even  here.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“You’re telling me,” The assassin gasped. “That the senator…paid me to…<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">assassinate</span></em> his own <em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">daughter!?</span></em>”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury nodded grimly, her visor telling her that the man was telling the truth. He clearly didn’t know the name of his target.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  fucking monster!” the assassin growled. Indeed, the man had more morals  than all the other assassins in Japan combined, and Sailor Mercury was  grateful for that. Jupiter had long let go of his neck and was pacing  up and down the man’s hall.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let me guess-Rei Hino is a friend of yours?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Mercury nodded again, too stunned to speak.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to bring him down.” The assassin snarled. “I’ll help you two in  any way I can. But, his assassination—I can’t do. My…license let’s me  work, but I have a feeling the murder of a government official won’t be  accepted.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Besides,” Jupiter hissed. “I want the pleasure of taking care of him. I’m sure Uranus would too.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Katai <strong>Hitogoroshi.” Katai reached out a hand. “My resources are at your disposal.” </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Mercury  and Jupiter shared a look. Yes, this was the man who had almost killed  Rei, but he was willing to rectify his mistake; to repent. Plus, inside  information would be a big help.</strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>“Sailor Mercury and  Jupiter.” Jupiter said, grabbing Katai’s hand in a firm handshake.  “Superhuman abilities ready for revenge.” </strong></span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
<strong><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A/N: Well, what have we here!? A MALE Oc from me!? AND, Mamoru's actually a GOOD GUY!?!?!? -the world explodes-</span></strong>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Katai-Honorable </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Hitogoroshi-Murderer </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Hahaoya-Mother </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>Otome-Daughter (I think…) </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><strong>The land between life and death was inspired by that Inuyasha episode that I’m too lazy to look up at this moment. </strong></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2"><em>“Without pain, there is no pleasure, without sorrow, there is no joy. Without hate, there can be no love.”</em><strong><em> –</em></strong><strong>This  was partly inspired by kamikazecat’s ‘Just Happy? Or Happier?’  ReixUsagi series. If you haven’t read them, read them. Now. I command  you!! </strong></span></p>
