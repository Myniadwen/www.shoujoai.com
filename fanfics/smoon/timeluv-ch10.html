<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>	Soft voices stirred Rei from her sleep and she blinked sleepily, 
still not quite awake. After their encounter with Akio, Kira had felt 
too drained to go and clean up the whole house enough for them to be 
comfortable sleeping in it. So, she had focused mostly on the main 
living room and Rei and Ami had pitched in, not having much else to do. 
After several hours of what could easily be considered hard labor it had 
been spruced up enough to pass even Michiru&#39;s standard of cleanliness. 
Rei had exulted, and promptly fallen asleep on one of the plush couches 
they had moved into the main room. She didn&#39;t know how long she&#39;d been 
asleep but looking out one of the many windows she could see that it was  
now much darker outside. Confused she yawned quietly and turned her head 
to the side, searching for the source of her awakening. She found it in 
Ami and Kira who were sitting on the biggest of the couches, talking 
quietly. Curious, Rei remained still as she watched Ami talk animatedly 
and Kira watch, amused.
	&quot;Really? You sure you want to do this to her Ami-chan?&quot; Kira asked 
and Rei watched Ami flush and look down, then look up and nod. Kira 
laughed quietly and Ami grinned, apparently pleased. Nom wide awake Rei 
sat up and both girls turned to her.
	&quot;Hey, what&#39;s going on?&quot; She asked and Ami only flushed as Kira 
looked over at her.
     &quot;Ami-chan?&quot; She questioned and Ami looked up and grinned at Kira 
before turning and smirking at Rei. Rei&#39;s eyes widened slightly at Ami&#39;s 
look and watched as Kira stood and walked over to Rei. She reached down 
and pulled Rei up gently, pulling her backwards to the couch. Rei 
stumbled forward as Kira sat down, still not saying a word and turned 
Rei so her back faced Kira&#39;s front. Kira pulled Rei down so the 
Priestess was sitting in Kira&#39;s lap and Rei growled lightly.
	&quot;Oi...&quot; She grumbled, forcing herself to her knees, trying to turn 
around and yell at Kira but was help firm in Kira&#39;s lap, one of her 
knees on either side of Kira&#39;s legs. &quot;Oi!&quot; She said again, annoyed and 
almost yelped as Kira leaned over and lightly nipped her neck. Her back 
arched lightly at the contact but before she could make up her mind to 
yell at the vampire again Ami shocked her. The blue haired girl reached 
over and put a hand on each of Rei&#39;s shoulders, pushing her back lightly 
until Rei&#39;s back bumped into Kira&#39;s front. As she slid Rei back Ami 
climbed up onto the couch too, straddling Kira&#39;s legs as Rei was so she 
was front to front with Rei. Rei raised her eyebrows, very confused.
	&quot;Ami-chan...&quot; She started but Ami just grinned at her and slid her 
hands down Rei&#39;s sides softly, not breaking Rei&#39;s gaze. When her hands 
reached Rei&#39;s hips she slid them under the girl&#39;s shirt, her fingers 
brushing Rei&#39;s stomach. Rei took a deep breath as Ami continued to move 
her hands around the raven-haired girls waist until they rested on her 
lower back. Then she tightened her grip and pulled Rei forward, forcing 
their hips together. Rei&#39;s closed her eyes briefly and inhaled quickly, 
her lips parting slightly. Ami leaned forward and after meeting Kira&#39;s 
eyes over Rei&#39;s shoulder, pressed her lips to Rei&#39;s. Rei had no time to 
react to the kiss as Kira chose the same time to sink her fangs into the 
Priestess&#39;s neck.
	Rei moaned lightly into Ami&#39;s mouth and suddenly didn&#39;t find 
moving all that important. Whether it was Kira&#39;s bite that was soothing 
her, or Ami&#39;s kiss that was exciting her she didn&#39;t know, and didn&#39;t 
care. Ami tilted her head, deepening their kiss and sliding her tongue 
past Rei&#39;s lips, teasing the other&#39;s girl with her own. She continued to 
lightly flick Rei&#39;s tongue with her own until Rei got pulled into it, 
trying to match Ami&#39;s movements. Ami used the distraction to move her 
hands to Rei&#39;s front, scraping her nails lightly across the fire 
senshi&#39;s taut abdomen. Kira arched her own hips forward, using the 
pressure to hold Rei against Ami. Satisfied that Rei was enjoying her 
touch, Ami slowly slipped her hands up Rei&#39;s torso, letting them come to 
rest cupping her cotton-covered breasts. Rei arched lightly into the 
touch, whimpering as Ami squeezed lightly. Ami opened her eyes and met 
Kira&#39;s gaze. Almost nodding, Kira let one of her hands leave its place 
on Rei&#39;s arms to wrap around the girls waist, holding her close. Rei 
shifted, but didn&#39;t pull away so Kira let her other hand trace gently 
down Rei&#39;s other arm, entwining their fingers briefly before letting it 
travel further down. Rei&#39;s skin jumped lightly under Kira&#39;s touch. She 
could swear she felt trails of  ice under the vampires touch, and 
threads of fire coming from Ami. Kira let her stray hand come to rest on 
Rei&#39;s thigh, stroking her lightly. Rei shuddered but only pressed closer 
to Ami, entranced by the feel of the ice senshi&#39;s lips against her own.
	Pleased with Rei&#39;s reactions Ami pushed her hips against Rei and 
almost smiled when she felt Rei press back. Carefully she moved one hand 
to the front clasp on Rei&#39;s bra and, after pausing a second to see Rei&#39;s 
reaction, flicked it open. Rei shivered and, as if just realizing that 
Kira had let go, raised her arms and put them around Ami&#39;s neck. Ami 
smiled into the kiss and pulled the bra away from Rei&#39;s body, letting 
her breasts fall free. When Rei&#39;s response was to sigh softly Ami cupped 
her breasts once again, this time letting each thumb lightly rub the 
nipples that now tightened at her touch. Rei gasped  as soon as Ami had 
cupped her and started to shiver when she began lightly massaging her 
nipples. She pressed herself closer to Ami, enjoying every second of the 
attention, having nearly forgotten about the vampire whose arms 
encircled her waist.
	Kira chuckled lightly as she tasted Rei giving into the pleasure 
that Ami was giving her. Rei&#39;s desire was growing quickly and Kira took 
advantage of it, tightening her grip around Rei as her other hand 
unbuttoned Rei&#39;s jeans, slowly sliding the zipper down.  Rei stiffened 
slightly and quivered as she now concentrated fully on Kira&#39;s hand as it 
brushed the top of her underwear teasingly. Then, with slow deliberate 
moves Kira pushed her hand lower under the denim, cupping Rei fully 
through the thin cotton covering. Unable to deny her need for this 
feeling, her curiosity and want of what came next, Rei pressed herself 
down onto Kira&#39;s hand and felt Kira squeeze lightly, letting a finger 
play tenderly over her center. 
	Ami smiled into the kiss that was quickly becoming needy and let 
her forefingers and thumbs come together, lightly rolling Rei&#39;s nipples. 
Rei moaned  and Ami flicked the end of her fingers over the rosy tips, 
feeling Rei shiver and gasp each time. The fire in Rei&#39;s blood was 
nearly boiling and Kira made the next move, moving her hand to slide up, 
then slip down under Rei&#39;s panties. Rei quivered as Kira&#39;a hand touched 
her, the skin on skin contact driving her wild. Feeling the heat  
radiating onto her hand Kira bit harder and moved a finger, sliding it 
between Rei&#39;s folds and into the wetness. Rei hissed as Kira lightly 
rubbed her clit and started to shiver uncontrollably, her body seemingly 
tightening with every stroke of the vampire&#39;s finger, every twitch of 
Ami&#39;s hand. Ami broke the kiss with Rei, hearing Rei groan as she did, 
and started kissing and licking down the girl&#39;s neck, cuddling into the 
side that Kira had not claimed.  Ami felt Kira shift forward so she 
could slide her hand further between Rei&#39;s legs and felt Rei hold her 
tightly. Smiling she opened her mouth and hovered over the soft skin, 
waiting for her cue. 
	Rei was aching inside, her need growing with each second. Her 
breathing was shallow and shaky as she bit her lip feeling Kira slide 
her hand lower. Unconsciously she let her legs open more, anticipating, 
inviting Kira. Kira took it and after a second pause, pushed gently 
inside of Rei. At the same time that Kira entered her Rei felt Ami bite 
the other side of her neck. The combination of feeling someone inside of 
her for the first time, the pleasure of Kira&#39;s fangs in her neck, of 
Ami&#39;s hands on her breasts, and the pain of the blue-haired girls bite, 
Rei arched, crying out as her body exploded and her mind went blank. 
Fire and build-up from the recent stress just melted under the pressure 
as the liquid fire scorched through her body.
	Ami moved her hands around Rei and held her close as Kira pulled 
out of her and wrapped both arms around Rei&#39;s front, ending the bite 
with a final soft kiss. She was reeling from the pleasure overload but 
knew that Rei had needed the release. And knowing that it had been Ami&#39;s 
idea to tease Rei like this, she didn&#39;t even care that her own body was 
crying out for release having not settled fully from Ami&#39;s peak not even 
a day ago. Rei slumped forward against Ami, trying to catch her breath 
and Ami rubbed her back soothingly. Pulling back Rei smiled softly 
seeing the red glow of her own sigil reflected off of Ami&#39;s eyes. Ami 
smiled at her tenderly and their gazes locked.
	&quot;Well, now I know what you were whispering about.&quot; Rei said softly 
and Ami gave a small laugh, a slight blush springing to her cheeks. Rei 
opened her mouth to tease Ami about it when Kira&#39;s grip on her tightened 
suddenly.
	&quot;Son of a bitch!&quot; She hissed and Rei turned her head in shock, Ami 
staring opened mouthed as well. Kira was staring straight ahead but 
turned and looked at them with an apologetic smile. &quot;The fates seem to 
be against us.&quot; She said, nodding her head to the front door. &quot;Someone, 
or rather someones, are coming.&quot; Rei and Ami looked over at the door in 
fear.
	&quot;Is it Akio-san?&quot; Ami asked worriedly and Kira frowned, helping 
first Ami and then Rei to their feet as she stood beside them.
	&quot;I can&#39;t tell. But there is a hell of a lot of power coming off of 
whoever it is, so I&#39;d guess that would be a good bet. Dammit! How did he 
find me here?&quot; Ami shivered and moved behind Kira with Rei as the 
vampire stared to glow.
	&quot;What are we going to do Kira-chan?&quot; Rei asked, tensing. Kira 
sighed and dug into her pocket, tossing the two small items she pulled 
out back at the girls. They stared at their wands in shock and Kira 
smiled.
	&quot;I picked them up when I visited the cat. I thought they might be 
useful. You&#39;d better transform.&quot; Exchanging a quick glance both Ami and 
Rei called out their transformations. It didn&#39;t matter how Kira had 
gotten their wands, only that they needed them now. Curious as she was 
to the scene behind her, Kira kept her eyes glued to the door, the power 
and presence coming at them quickly. Mercury and Mars took their 
positions at her side and the door burst open.</pre>
