Shinozaki is the Japanese name for the boy known as &#39;Ken&#39; in the dub
version of SM.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;I can&#39;t do this mother. I&#39;ve tried, but I can&#39;t. I know I can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Makoto, this isn&#39;t just a simple take it or leave it choice. This is
the duty you were born with, and it can&#39;t be tossed aside on a whim.
You are the heir, and when the time comes, you must rule over Jupiter
and its moons.&quot;

&quot;No I don&#39;t. I wish to sever any claim I have to the throne, and grant
my rite of passage to my brother Shinozaki.&quot;

&quot;Shinozaki is nine years your junior. If something were to happen to
your father and I in the near future, him taking our place would be
completely out of the question. Use your head, Makoto.&quot;

&quot;I am using it! I&#39;m using it to decide what I want to do with my life!&quot;

&quot;And pray tell, what exactly is it you want to do with your life then?&quot;

&quot;I...I wish to leave Jupiter...and serve as head of the Royal
Guard...on Venus.&quot;

&quot;I see. So you&#39;re content to just throw away your heritage and cast off
your obligation to defend your home, to go and serve another planet.&quot;

&quot;Jupiter and Venus have had a respected and recognized alliance for
years. It was you and father who instated it. Our people are born
warriors - our military is one of the finest in the galaxy. We can
handle ourselves against Beryl. Venus, however, can not. The planet is
small, and right next door to Beryl&#39;s domain. Their military has grown
into something formidable since father took over training...but they
still don&#39;t have the manpower. It&#39;s not enough.&quot;

&quot;So you think if _you_ go there, suddenly your presence will even the
odds? I admit you are stronger than even we imagined you&#39;d turn out,
but be sensible Mako. You aren&#39;t an army. We are deploying nearly half
of our defense to Venus three days from now. That should be more than
enough people to fend off Beryl&#39;s minions.&quot;

&quot;The woman is a monster! You don&#39;t understand, I have to go!&quot;

&quot;Oh, I think I understand perfectly Makoto.&quot;

&quot;If you understood, then you would know why I can&#39;t just sit by when
Beryl&#39;s planning on conquering our sister planet.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not our sister planet that you care about, Mako. It&#39;s the young
girl who will one day be ruling it.&quot;

&quot;.....&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t want to lose you, Makoto. Not only does your planet need you,
but we love you as well.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t just stand by and let this happen! Mother, I will go there,
even if I have to hijack a ship. And if that&#39;s the way I leave, you can
rest assured I&#39;ll never come back.&quot;

&quot;You love her so much you&#39;d push us aside so quickly?&quot;

&quot;...I&#39;ll do what I have to do. If that&#39;s what ends up happening, it
won&#39;t be my fault.&quot;

&quot;I see...&quot;

&quot;By your leave, mother.&quot;

&quot;Stop. Turn around and sit down.&quot; *giggle*

&quot;....what&#39;s so funny?!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s just wonderful when things work out the way they were always
intended. Go relieve the guards and then meet me and your father at the
docking station.&quot;

&quot;But I told you, I&#39;m going to--&quot;

&quot;Ah ah ah. It would be a shame if you left without at least saying
hello to Minako.&quot;

&quot;What? You mean, she&#39;s--&quot;

&quot;Yes, she&#39;s going to be staying here for a while. Her parents share
your fears, and want to know that if anything happens, their daughter
is safe, and may one day be able to pick up the pieces of their fallen
planet and restore it to its former glory. But wait, wait, don&#39;t go
running off just yet. She won&#39;t arrive for another few minutes yet, and
when she does, her Highness Queen Selenity needs to speak to you both
via our communications system.&quot;

&quot;Queen Selenity? What does she want with us?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know yet exactly yet. All I can tell you is that it&#39;s
something concerning her daughter....&quot;

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Makoto? ...hey...are you alright?&quot;

I blinked and looked up from my reverie. Stevie was standing in front
of me, a tray of drinks in her hand and her brow furrowed. &quot;Sorry,&quot; I
mumbled &quot;I was just...kinda lost for a minute there.&quot; Another memory.
Another little piece of my former life back. I silently thanked the
gods that it didn&#39;t knock me out this time. There would have been too
many questions I didn&#39;t want to answer if that&#39;d happened. Too many
questions.

&quot;Mako hunny, I&#39;m not a doctor but I&#39;m pretty sure what happened there
wasn&#39;t a good thing. You were completely zoned for nearly fifteen
minutes.&quot; She slid her tray under the bar counter and poured two shots
of whisky for a waitress. &quot;This girl has you really messed up, doesn&#39;t
she?&quot;

I shrugged and turned away. My pain is something I don&#39;t enjoy sharing.
I don&#39;t want pity, so I try to never give anyone reason to feel it. It
took a long time before I was comfortable enough with the other senshi
to even tell them that I lived alone because my parents died in a plane
crash. And even then, the only reason I did it was because there was
only so many times I could tell them they were gone on &#39;business
trips&#39;.

I never told them that I was on the plane when it crashed though. I
still have nightmares, sometimes. Flames on the wing, eating into the
passenger car. People screaming, shouting, pushing, praying. Luggage
toppling down on them. Smoke so thick it burned to breathe in.
Coughing, gagging. Crying for my parents. Crawling over bleeding,
sobbing bodies to find them. The man I saw, with a piece of shrapnel
wedged into his torso, bleeding to death, slowly. And then the
explosion....

No one knew how I survived. There was one other man who had, but he
would spend the rest of his life in a wheelchair. Me, I had a few cuts
and bruises. That&#39;s all. I fell through a hole in the sky, and somehow,
managed to come out of it nearly unscathed. On the physical level,
anyway. Mentally...I was as broken as anyone else on that plane ended
up.

It didn&#39;t look like I would have any kin to stay with. My mother was
Asian, and had married a gaijin from America. That&#39;s where I got my
height- my father was white. Their marriage was frowned upon on both
sides, and they were disowned entirely. I know I have an aunt and a few
uncles somewhere in Tokyo, but I&#39;ve never even met them. I&#39;m pretty
sure they don&#39;t even know I exist. My grandmother, on the other hand,
made a special effort to &#39;get to know me&#39; when she heard about the
accident. She just seemed to appear, out of the blue. You see, because
their families had disowned them, my parents left everything they had
to me. My father was an architect, and a good one at that. They&#39;d built
themselves a pretty hefty estate before their premature demise -- and
every penny of it suddenly belonged to me. &#39;Grandma&#39; knew what a rich
little girl I was, and played it to the hilt.

She took me in and acted as my legal guardian for five years. There was
always something about her that rubbed me the wrong way, but I could
never figure it out. She always seemed very loving, baking me cookies
and reading me stories. She never yelled at me, even when I broke some
of her beautiful dishes. She was always there to comfort me when I
grieved over the loss of my mother and father. She was a lady of
fairytale, plain and simple. Like an angel come down to watch over me
while my parents met God. She was sly, that old bitch. But there was
one thing that gave her away.

Every so often, she&#39;d sit me down and have a &#39;talk&#39;. She&#39;d tell me that
she was getting old, and as much as she loved me, it may soon be time
for her to leave this world, too. She&#39;d do it in a way that never made
me upset; speaking in calm, friendly tones while she held my hands. She
would tell me she worried, that when she was gone there&#39;d be no one
there to take care of me. Then she would slip me a piece of paper, and
tell me if I wanted to make sure I was safe when she was gone, all I
had to do was sign it. I always did as she asked, and she&#39;d always be
so happy afterwards that I&#39;d get a whole frosted cake to myself with
some dumplings. I had no idea just why she was so happy. By the time I
reached the age of fourteen, I decided to find out.

Grandma always kept her important papers in a drawer of an old dresser
in the spare room. I&#39;d found her hiding place by accident when I was
looking for some rice cakes. This time my presence was no accident. I
knew what I was looking for, and I found it.

The total value of my parents combined estates was nearly ten million
dollars. They owned various corporate buildings, had a lot of booming
stock, and invested wisely. They owned two houses, each in the ritzy
section of Juuban (Minako and her family lived in that area.). They
were joint owners of a nightclub (which my father had designed
himself), and my mother had a priceless antique collection. Last, but
not least, they owned the entire apartment complex I live in. Yeah,
that&#39;s right. I don&#39;t just own my apartment -- I own all of them.

My grandmother had been playing on my naivety for five years. One by
one, she&#39;d gotten me to sign almost everything I had over to her. The
only things that were still legally mine were a few of my mother&#39;s more
valuable antiques, and the apartment complex. I was crushed when I
found out, not because I cared very much about the money, but because
I&#39;d been so cruelly used. My grandmother didn&#39;t love me at all. She was
no guardian angel, come to steal me away from the pain. She was just a
greedy old woman, using me to get a hold of my parent&#39;s life savings,
and she did a fine job of it. I packed my things and left while she
slept that very night.

She never tried to find me.

It all worked out in the end.

&quot;Hey, Makoto,&quot; Stevie slammed the palm of her hand on the countertop in
front of me.

&quot;Huh?&quot;

She waggled her eyebrows. &quot;Looks like you&#39;ve got yourself a bit of a
fan club over there.&quot; She pushed an electric blue drink in my direction.
&quot;This is from the cute blond.&quot; She quirked an eyebrow and nodded in the
girl&#39;s direction. &quot;If I were you, I&#39;d stop moping here with me and go
ask her to dance.&quot;

I looked over at the girl. Stevie was right, she was cute. Actually,
she looked a lot like Minako. Long blond hair, deep blue
eyes...never-ending legs and muscular thighs. The only thing missing was
the trademark red bow, and a few of the curves I know by heart. No one
could ever best Minako in my eyes...but this stranger came close.

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; I mumbled.

Stevie scowled. &quot;Why not? Makoto, she&#39;s the best looking girl in this
entire bar, and she wants your attention! Now, I know you&#39;re new to
this whole gig, but come on!&quot; she giggled and pointed to a dark table
in the corner of the bar. &quot;Take a look at the group of dykes over
there. They&#39;re so jealous I think one of &#39;em is gonna pop any minute
now. If for no other reason, just do it to piss &#39;em off. I _know_ you
like pissing people off.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Stevie...I just...can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Why not? Is it because of that chick you&#39;re pining over? Look, Mako,
that girl over there, she knows what she is, and what she wants. You
don&#39;t have to worry about the damn head games with someone like that.&quot;

&quot;...No. It&#39;s not about-&quot;

&quot;Liar. Get your ass up off of that stool and dance with her.&quot;

&quot;I told you, I can&#39;t. It&#39;s not just Min-...the girl. I can&#39;t dance,
Stevie. I don&#39;t know how. I&#39;d step all over her.&quot;

Stevie raised both of her eyebrows and took a step back. &quot;You&#39;ve got to
be kidding me.&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Now I&#39;ve heard everything.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;I still can&#39;t believe
that.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, well, it&#39;s true. So leave me alone.&quot; I was about to go outside
for some fresh air when a poster behind the bar caught my attention. It
was a group picture of all the sailor senshi in each other&#39;s arms,
presented in such a manner that there could be no mistaking their
relation to one another. If they were a family- this was incest.
&quot;Interesting piece of...art, you have there Stevie. What&#39;s up with it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you mean my senshi?&quot; she clung to her poster with starry eyes.
&quot;Everybody around here loves them. I mean, not only are they Japan&#39;s
biggest heroes, but they&#39;re also lesbians to boot! ...Or so we think,
anyway.&quot;

I fiddled with one of the pockets on my cargo pants. &quot;What makes you
think that, just out of curiosity?&quot;

&quot;Well, most would say wishful thinking, but,&quot; she leaned in and
whispered conspiratorially to me &quot;I saw them once, downtown. A youma
attacked while I was doing some shopping...and WHAMMO! They were just
there. It was incredible...I&#39;d never really believed in them before, ya
know? They were always on par with Santa, or the Easter Bunny in my
head. A wonderful fantasy. But now, now I know they&#39;re real.&quot;

&quot;And the fact that they&#39;re real makes them....?&quot;

&quot;Let me finish. You see, while they were fighting, one of them was hit.
The one in the orange fuku, I think. I&#39;m pretty sure. Anyway, the one
in the green...she gets so mad she charges that youma, and tears his
bloody arm off with her bare hands. Her BARE HANDS! There was goop
flyin everywhere...it was really something. So after she goes and rips
I&#39;m real good, the other senshi move in for the kill. The green one
backs off after that though, and picks up the one in the orange. She&#39;s
woozy, but otherwise seems ok.&quot;

&quot;So that&#39;s the only reason you have to back up your theory? The fact
they don&#39;t like to see each other hurt?&quot; I felt so completely exposed
under her observations. I couldn&#39;t stand it.

&quot;No,&quot; she shook her head. &quot;You don&#39;t understand. The look the green
clad one had on her face...the way she was so gentle with her fellow
senshi. There was just something there, ya know? Maybe a lot of people
wouldn&#39;t pick up on it...but I could see it. I could see it.&quot;

I was quiet for a few minutes after that. I knew the battle she was
referring to...it was a long time ago, but I remembered. Minako had
taken a heavy blow to the head from that youma, and it pushed me over
the edge a little. No, a lot. Despite her protests and insistence that
she was alright, I carried her home that night. It was probably a good
thing I did too - she kept drifting in and out of consciousness along
the way. She was in pretty good shape after a good nights rest, though.

I looked back at the poster that&#39;d captured my attention earlier. The
artist was good, whoever it was must have put a lot of effort into the
piece. I couldn&#39;t find one flaw in the entire thing. We were all
perfectly proportioned -I was even almost a head taller than everyone
else- and our elements were all present in the colored background
behind us. But despite its obvious beauty, I hated the picture. I had
to fight the urge to rip it to shreds, and set it aflame. Not because
it told a lie. Not because I was offended, or didn&#39;t want things to be
that way.

But because in it, Minako had her arms wrapped around Rei. Not me.
Me...I was on the other side of her. So very far away.

A million miles away. I&#39;m always a million miles away...

----------------------------------------------------------------------

&#39;Hey, this is Makoto. You know the drill. Leave a message, and If I
like ya, I&#39;ll call back.&#39;

Mako-chan, are you there? If you can hear me, please pick up......

Alright, I&#39;m almost finished with this shoot. As soon as I&#39;m done, I&#39;m
going over there...don&#39;t do anything crazy Mako-chan. Just wait for
me....
