<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">On Jupiter, Part One: Man Overboard<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hair  plastered to their heads, clothes soaked to their skin, their heavy  boots sucked and squelched in the mud under the dense rainforest canopy.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">They’d  only just left the protection of the shuttle and already, they were  waterlogged. Minako huffed under the heavy pack she supported on her  shoulders, weighed down by the relentless Jovian rains. She could feel  the Martian’s eyes on her and felt a mixture of excitement and  curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?” She barked, tossing her head and shedding water droplets that immediately accumulated again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “So you <em>don’t</em> melt.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  brows met. The comment had flown over her head with an audible whoosh,  but her companions’ stifled chuckles were enough to let her know she’d  been insulted.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sound of metal being unsheathed was an ample  derailment of a brewing argument and all eyes turned to Makoto who held  a long, flat blade with her sword arm. “The path seems overgrown. Looks  like it’ll be slow going.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The four women examined the state of  the muddy path. With the constant downpour, visibility was limited to  only a few dozen feet around them in either direction, but the arms of  hanging vines and a vast network of crooked limbs that clogged the  narrow passage was telling enough even in the dusky red light cast by  the thick clouds overhead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Looks like your people don’t travel to the pole much.” Minako said flatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Jovian only shrugged. “Whose’ does?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami unconsciously stepped closer to their tallest warrior. “It’s like a warning. Maybe we shouldn’t—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s sudden laughter did battle with a clap of thunder. “You’re supposed to be the <em>logical</em> one, Ami-chan. You can’t be scared.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Anything  you’ve heard about the pole is just a fairy tale, Ami-san, designed by  adults to frighten misbehaving children.” Rei said, at odds with  supporting the leader of the senshi.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But there’s a grain of truth to every fairy tale, Rei-san.” Ami said worriedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Venusian stepped up beside the Martian and slapped her on the shoulder,  perhaps harder than she’d really intended. “Rei and I visited Mars’  pole and lived to tell the tale, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s unyielding violet  eyes conveyed her confidence. “Perhaps the youma are intelligent enough  to feed off that fear; perhaps that’s why they hide at the pole,  because it’s a place no one travels, where their movements would go  undetected.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This comforting shred of logic seemed to ease the Mercurian greatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto  laid a comforting hand on Ami’s arm. “Come on, Ami-chan. Besides, the  dangers of the pole’s got nothing on the poisonous insects and man  eating plants and animals of the rainforest.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Ami half squeaked, half screamed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smacked her lips and pushed the petite girl forward. “She’s just pulling your chain, Ami-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Mercurian bristled and shot a scathing look at her tall friend. “Jupiter Makoto, you <em>know</em> I hate it when you do that!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Jovian only chuckled and advanced, her deep laugh mingling with her  blade as it screamed through the air and sliced into vines and limbs  effortlessly.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
“Maa, come on!” Minako wailed. “We’ve been sinking in this mud for four hours now!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Bringing  up the rear, Rei pushed the Venusian forward with the tips of her  fingers against the other woman’s arms, if only so that she didn’t  outright bump into Minako’s slowing form. “For a leader, you can be  awfully whiny.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yeah, well maybe some of us aren’t as accustomed  to carrying everything they need to survive on their backs. Take  Ami-chan for example. Ne, you want a break, don’t you, Ami-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not  even chancing a backwards glance, the Mercurian followed close on  Makoto’s heels. “I’m doing quite fine, thank you. Besides, we should  cover as much ground as possible. The storms here are unpredictable and  could hinder our progress.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean <em>this</em> isn’t a storm?”  Minako asked, indicating the heavy rain and gusty winds that had only  worsened since they’d begun their mission.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you kidding? This is nice Jovian weather!” Makoto said, shouting over a clap of thunder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  snorted in the Venusian’s ear and shouldered her way past Minako  towards the front of the pack, and she didn’t stop there. Swiping  Makoto’s blade right out of her hand, she began to attack the vines  that hindered their passage.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I like this girl already.” The Jovian said as she fell into step behind Minako to pick up the rear.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine.” Minako spat. “You’re both barbarians then.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you two <em>do</em> complement each other quite nicely.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keh!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You <em>do</em> know she’s just doing that to show off to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What, swinging a machete around? Oh, I’m so <em>very</em> impressed.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto sighed. “Apparently, you just don’t get people like us.”</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
The  Martian manned the machete for several hours, clearing the path for  those that followed behind her. Minako, for all intents and purposes,  was always close on her heels, her eyes never seeming to waver from the  form of the one in front of her. Makoto, meanwhile, crept up next to  her blue haired friend, her weary eyes trained to the forest canopy.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’d get your head out of that report if I were you. Could be snakes around here.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ami  straightened up under the weight of her pack and focused her attention  even more on the transparent read out displayed before her. “Oh, Mako,  stop teasing me already.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No, really Ami, this area is very—“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Snake!” Rei’s warning was just a second too late.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m not falling for it you guys-“ Ami’s voice hitched in her throat and she screamed loudly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As  if a torch was set to a dry haystack, a flurry of activity ensued all  too quickly. Minako spun behind her, her sword drawn and screaming  towards the threat falling from the canopy above while Makoto leapt  forward, gathering the blue haired woman into her arms. Minako’s weapon  sliced through the snake, but the damage had already been done. The  half that was still attached to Ami had its fangs lodged deep in her  bicep muscle, even as its severed body continued to slither in  disconnect.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Makoto panicked. “Ami! Ami! Stay with me, it’s going to be alright!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Mercurian woman winced but choked out a hoarse laugh. “I know I will! It wasn’t poisonous!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Score one for booksmarts,” Makoto grumbled, realizing she’d overreacted, “but you’re still trembling. That can’t feel good.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This seemed to quiet the woman, and she allowed herself to relax in the arms of the strong Jovian.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  approached the two women with a small dagger in hand. No words were  needed. Ami nodded and turned her head away while the Priestess slipped  the blade underneath the snake’s fangs and pried its hinged jaw from  the woman’s flesh.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Ami-chan. There’s an herb in this forest  that will help ease the pain,” Makoto told the trembling woman, “I’m  sure I can find it for you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.” The Mercurian replied  detachedly as the Jovian set her down on shaky feet. Her adrenaline  wearing off, although the logical side of her knew she wasn’t in any  real danger, Ami was still very shaken.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m calling camp.”  Minako barked. She shrugged her shoulders and her pack fell to the  ground, sinking into the mud. “You,” she said, pointing at Makoto, “go  find this herb.” You,” she said, pointing to Rei, “stay with Ami, set  up tents. And I,” she said, pointing to herself, “will try to find  something dry to burn.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Each woman nodded and the leader of the  senshi turned to Makoto. “You have twenty minutes. No longer. Night is  falling and the storm is worsening.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Hazel eyes hardened. “Understood.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women disappeared into the forest.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
Lightening forked across the blackish red sky. She counted. ‘<em><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">One… two… thr-‘</span></em> the explosion of thunder shook Rei to her core. The storm’s center was nearly directly overhead.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  driving wind whipped the guy line from Rei’s hand and half of the tent  fell back to the ground. The Priestess growled and scrambled for the  errant line, finally securing it and pulling it taught against a small  tree. The tents were large, despite their small compression size, and  were quite the struggle for one person to set up.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  barely heard the faint call over the howling winds but the Martian  poked her head into Ami’s tent. A small, dim lantern shed barely enough  of a glow for her to see by, but she was relieved to find that although  Ami looked rather pale, she was dry, and resting, as she’d been  instructed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Stormy blue eyes met Rei’s. “It’s… been thirty minutes. The storm’s worsened. Maybe something happened…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  didn’t say anything. She didn’t have to, she knew. Her feeling of  unease had steadily grown as soon as Minako and Makoto had left. She  would wait no longer. The Priestess nodded her intent and released the  flap to Ami’s tent.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Once again, the Priestess  poked her head in. “I’m going to find them.” She could see the worry  written on Ami’s face and a rare smile graced her own. “Don’t worry,  I’ll bring her back to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The petite woman blushed and sputtered, and Rei left her with a small smile and her dignity.</span></p>
<hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="100%" />
She  had promised to bring Makoto back, but as she stood at the intersection  where the Venusian and the Jovian had parted ways, she wasn’t in the  least surprised to find the pull of a different aura drawing her first.  Whether Minako was aware of it or not, she was thinking of Rei;  searching for her, calling to her… and like a moth to a flame, Rei  surrendered to its call.
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Visibility was near zero and the red glow of  the storm clouds illuminated little more than the driving rain and the  flashes of lightening only served to blind her after its brightness had  faded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So the Priestess shut her eyes and relied on her other  senses to guide her, latching onto the one thing her mind was so  completely centered on; the aura that was all warmth, concern,  confusion and sheer draw, the aura that was so distinctly Venus Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  going was tough at first. She’d anticipated a steep drop too soon and  had slid some twenty feet into a rocky gorge. She rose; aware of the  cuts and bruises she’d find later, and continued. Several times her  heavy boots had tangled in the merciless vines and she’d fallen into  the mud, only to lift herself up and continue, for she knew, every step  brought her closer to Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And the closer she got, the more  she realized; she only wanted to see the woman safe and sound. Perhaps  she wouldn’t mind the confusing Venusian’s incessant touching and  strange mood swings as much, so long as she knew that she was okay.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess finally opened her eyes to find the blonde warrior standing  at the other end of the narrow trail, looking entirely lost, but  unscathed and uninjured.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako.” The relief she felt battled  with a sudden lightheadedness brought about by the exertion she’d  expended to follow the Venusian’s aura.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And then the woman was across the clearing, and as Rei had expected, in her arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Rei hugged her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But how did you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I sensed you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Cerulean eyes, so close to her own, examined her blank expression. “Like you do with the youma?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Still  clinging tightly to the other woman, Minako’s brows furrowed and she  paused, seeming to withdraw into herself. “Mako-chan.” She whispered.  “I feel… no, I sense her. I sense her… through you?”</span></p>
“Don’t touch me!”
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s voice echoed in her head, and when coupled with the bitter  memory of the other woman pushing her away, the Venusian tore herself  from the Martian’s arms.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is your power?” Minako asked quietly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  turned her profile away darkly. “I can sense auras. I can also predict  danger. Some call it a power. I’ve generally thought of it as a curse.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then, what I saw yesterday while we were sitting under the tree…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It  could have been a vision of the past or of a possible future. You  siphoned it from me. I can become a conductor of the image or the  feeling I sense.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then Makoto… she got lost in the storm, too? I sensed her through touching you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  only nodded, waiting for the inevitable mistrustful response she was so  used to receiving once explaining her spiritual powers. The rain was  driving even harder. The temperature was dropping. She shuddered  involuntarily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly, a warm hand slipped into her own. Violet  eyes found cerulean. Minako was pressed tightly against her side. A  wide smile that seemed brighter than even the erratic lightening lit  her face and warmed Rei’s heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s find Mako-chan. Together.”</span></p>
‘Together…’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei reluctantly pulled away from Minako’s warmth, but kept her  fingers securely laced around the other woman’s. “Lets go.” She barked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Concentrating  for two was even harder than concentrating for one, but Rei found that  she did a better job of finding even footing with her eyes closed when  Minako was attached to her. She could only imagine the argument she’d  spark if she’d caused them half the stumbles and falls she’d  experienced alone. But the energy she expended to do so was taking a  toll on her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess came to a sudden stop.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne,  is Mako-chan alright? I don’t feel her aura any - Rei?” Minako was  pressed against Rei’s side once more, supporting the slightly taller  woman’s shaking frame. “Are you alright?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian pulled  herself together, straightening her form against the other woman’s  concern. “I’m fine.” She spat, “I just lost hold it for a second.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  even as Rei picked up the pace and pulled her along, Minako couldn’t  help but worry. She was tempted to demand that they stop for a rest  when a familiar voice called out above the thunder.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan! Rei-chan!” The Jovian waved her arms and the others finally saw her in a flash of lightening.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  punched her tall friend on the shoulder. “Don’t you know you’re  supposed to stand in one spot when you get lost so your rescuers can  find you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well I didn’t expect to get my own personal search party.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You can thank Rei for that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Jovian turned serious, and rested her hands on the Martian’s shoulders. “Ne, Rei-san, how was Ami when you left her?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine!”  The Priestess barked. She brushed the brunette’s hands off her  shoulders and then held a palm to her forehead. “She was fine. But we  need to get back. We’re not far. You’ve been wandering in the right  direction.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Of course I’m not. I used to <em>live</em> here!” Makoto chuckled, but then turned confused eyes to the Martian. “But how did you-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just  follow me.” The Martian commanded, hauling Minako forward and leading  the group back through the trees, over a slight rise, and then finally  back to flat ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, are you sure you’re alright?” It was the third time the Priestess had stumbled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m fine!” Rei said, even as she stumbled once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei-san, perhaps we should take a break.” Makoto suggested.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.”  The Martian replied hoarsely, focusing her wavering hold on Ami’s aura  like a man overboard would a raft. “We’re almost there. Just a little  more”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Priestess led the women through a thick stand of trees,  and finally, she saw the tents. They’d made it. Clutching the herbs to  her chest, Makoto ran for it. Rei was vaguely aware of Minako dashing  forward, pulling her hand and tugging her excitedly towards the  relative comforts of the camp, but she met with the other woman with  resistance.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?” Minako stood in front of the seemingly frozen  woman, and when the Martian pitched forward, into the Venusian’s  confused but willing arms, Minako held Rei to her tightly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I want to hear nothing out of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  the Martian’s body had already gone limp, and Minako found herself  fully supporting the other woman’s weight, entirely too aware that the  Priestess’ weak form was burning hot and very feverish.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">---------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d  only been unconscious for a moment, but she’d faded in and out of  darkness since. She’d been vaguely aware of Minako shouting commands in  a stressed tone. She’d been pretty certain it was Makoto who had picked  her up and carried her into one of the two tents she’d set up, and  she’d been fairly sure she’d seen Ami’s small form darting around the  tent’s small footprint, laying out a bedroll and arranging supplies.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  Rei wasn’t fully aware of her surroundings until the only thing she  could hear was the howling winds and the rain as it drove against the  tent’s walls, and the only person left in front of her was Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Take your clothes off.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!?” Rei’s already shaky legs threatened to give out beneath her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You’re soaked and you need to dry off. Now don’t make me repeat myself or I’ll do it <em>for</em> you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  couldn’t tell if the Priestess’ hesitation was borne from her  exhaustion or something else, but finally, Rei began to strip.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  she was so very weak and her arms were getting stuck in the clinging,  wet material of her shirt. And so, the Venusian took the situation into  her own hands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I didn’t make you repeat yourself!” The Martian snapped as she felt Minako’s hands take the hem of her shirt.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Don’t worry. I won’t take advantage of you.” The Venusian said, her tone light and teasing. “Not unless you <em>want</em> me to, that is.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  quick pull of the shirt’s bottom had the material up and over Rei’s  head, but the motion had also thrown the weak Priestess off balance.  Minako had been quick to catch her though, and her arms wrapped around  Rei’s bare back and she pulled the other woman’s form into her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A slight blush dusted the Martian’s cheeks and she shivered, but it could have been the effects of her fever.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  thought you said you wouldn’t take advantage.” Rei’s quiet words were  deadpan and Minako couldn’t read the meaning in those cloudy, amethyst  eyes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I said I wouldn’t unless you <em>wanted</em> me to.”  Minako’s voice was a throaty whisper as the two women stared at each  other, standing on the edge of two very different possible outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Coward.’</em> Rei cursed herself. But even as exhaustion claimed her and she  surrendered to the darkness once again, she didn’t know if she was  cursing herself or Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">---------</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She’d been out long  enough that when she came to, she was dry and warm, wrapped in a heavy  blanket with a pillow under her head. She felt a cool towel lying on  her forehead and she knew her fever had broken.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She took a chance  on opening her eyes and found Minako, also dry and in fresh clothes,  sitting next to her bedroll, tying the ends of her wet, raven hair into  a thick braid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To keep the chill off you.” She answered the  Priestess’ unspoken question as she tied a length of leather around the  finished braid. Minako rose then, and as she shuffled around the tent’s  footprint, the Martian fingered her newly acquired hairstyle.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian returned quickly. Rei could sense her kneeling down behind her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sit up.” She commanded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei considered resisting for only a moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Good girl.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  pillow that her head had abandoned was removed, and Minako took its  place, pulling Rei’s back down against her chest. The Priestess was  acutely aware of the warmth of the other woman’s breath tickling her  neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“This is ridiculous.” The Martian spat in protest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A cup of sharp smelling liquid was thrust into her hands in response. “Drink this. Mako-chan said it’ll make you feel better.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei could only take the cup and stare at the leaves floating in the tepid water. How could she possibly drink with this <em>lump</em> in her throat? But Minako’s fingers splayed across the backs of her  hands and brought the cup up to meet her lips, and the Priestess forced  herself to drink. Wincing at its bitter taste, she pushed the cup away.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t need this.” She said weakly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mhmm.” Minako replied, even as she brought the cup to the defiant Martian’s lips once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei pushed it away. “I heal quickly.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mhmm.”  The Venusian tried a third time, she wouldn’t take Rei’s bait, she  couldn’t argue with the other woman when she was like this.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I can take care of myself!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  protest had some amount of power behind it, and the cup Minako had  offered tumbled from her hands and the Venusian found herself falling  backwards; the Martian woman not only pushing her away, but also  turning to follow that same motion weakly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako found herself  trapped; on her back with Rei’s hands on either side of her head, her  weak arms barely supporting her shaking torso above her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Can’t you just accept the fact that someone wants to take care of you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  whispered words were nearly lost to a gust of wind that threatened the  tent’s integrity. The frame shook and so did its occupants. The  Venusian’s hand reached up, and slowly cupped the Martian’s cheek.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei, it’s not a weakness to let someone get so close to you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The wind died down. Cerulean eyes searched amethyst. Hot breaths mingled. They were close. So close.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  then those amethyst eyes rolled backwards and though she fought it with  every last ounce of her being, Rei was taken by the blackness once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Coward.’</em> Minako spat, though she didn’t know if she was scolding herself or the woman she held in her protective embrace.</span></p>

Author’s Notes:
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This chapter was a lot of fun to write, especially that last part. </span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 4: On Jupiter, Part Two: Fire-arrow</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Behind  you!” Rei shouted, even as the youma she’d dropped rose to shaky feet  at the discovery that its wound had not been nearly as fatal as Venus  had intended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her words would never reach the Venusian in  time, and neither would Jupiter; the tall brunette’s fist sparkled with  lightening as she sparred with one of two remaining intact youma.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  image of the rising youma pulling the sword from the remains of its  chest and rushing Venus from behind burned itself into the Martian’s  retina…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A surge of power sparked deep within her. Instinct grabbed her, and the Priestess embraced it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She raised her bow, drew back the empty string and aimed…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  was suddenly looking down through the sight of a flaming arrow. It felt  natural, like an extension of herself, but refusing to be captured by  the wonder, she focused her aim on the youma who charged after Venus…  and released it.</span></p>
‘Please…’
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Even as the golden warrior thrust her sword deep into the heart of  the youma in front of her, the body of another fell beside her,  clipping her shoulder with its sharp claws and narrowly missing taking  her body to the ground with it. She recognized it as her first victim…  that hadn’t been dead after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Imbedded in the back of its skull, a flaming arrow winked out of existence.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei?”  She asked, her eyes darting to the other end of the battlefield where  the raven haired warrior slowly lowered her empty bow.</span></p>
