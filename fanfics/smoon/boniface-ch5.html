@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;@;-&gt;--@;-&gt;

Makoto staggers into the hospital, cursing fluently. She had her 
sleeve tied around her upper arm in a crude bandage. &#147;E-excuse me 
miss?&#148; A nurse approaches her cautiously. &#147;B-but could you please...&#148; 
She trails off, glancing in the waiting room.

Makoto follows the look and curses again. &#147;Sorry.&#148; She bites her lip 
and turns to face the glaring parents. &#147;I am so sorry. But I-&#147; Makoto 
gasps and steps away. &#147;Sorry.&#148;

&#147;What happened?&#148; Wanda gently takes Makoto&#146;s hand and leads her 
through the emergency doors. &#147;How much blood have you lost?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m not sure...&#148; Makoto shakes her head, taking a seat on the 
mattress. &#147;I&#146;ve been bleeding for about ten minutes now.&#148; She takes 
two gloves and eyes them curiously. &#147;You know, I haven&#146;t been in a 
hospital in...&#148; She releases her breath. &#147;Who knows how long.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s your name?&#148; Wanda ties the sleeve and disposes of it.

&#147;Kino...Makoto Kino.&#148; Makoto grins and holds out her hand. 

Wanda stops suddenly and shakes her head. &#147;No...&#148; She shakes her head 
again. &#147;You can&#146;t be.&#148;

&#147;Sure I am.&#148; Makoto frowns in confusion. She reaches into her bag, 
pulls out a leather wallet, and hands Wanda her health card and birth 
certificate. &#147;See? Kino Makoto. Born in Tokyo, Japan. December 5th, 
1985.&#148;

&#147;But, you...never mind.&#148; Wanda checks the cut on Makoto&#146;s upper arm 
and grunts. &#147;How&#146;d this happen?&#148;

&#147;Some guy wanted my uncles car. We had a disagreement and he tried to 
stab me.&#148; Makoto shrugs, putting on one glove. &#147;These things are 
pretty snug for gloves.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s how they were designed.&#148; A doctor walks in with a chart at 
hand. He steps in front of Makoto and inspects the injury. &#147;Five 
stitches should so it.&#148;

&#147;It&#146;s just a flesh wound.&#148; Makoto waves off his concern. &#147;How&#146;s Mr. 
Mizuno? Ah...Walter.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry Miss...Kino.&#148; The doctor gives the health card back to 
Wanda. &#147;But that&#146;s classified. I&#146;ll be back with the needle and 
thread-&#147;

&#147;How is he?&#148; Makoto growls suddenly. Ignoring the pain, she takes hold 
of his collar and lifts him up, an inch off the ground. &#147;Tell me 
Doctor...Parisk.&#148; She mocks. &#147;Or you will need the needles and 
thread.&#148;

&#147;I-I&#146;m not sure-aurg!&#148; 

Makoto hoists him up another inch, wincing but not giving in. &#147;It&#146;s 
just a flesh wound.&#148; She repeats to Wanda, quickly turning her 
attention back to the doctor. &#147;How is Walter Mizuno?&#148;

&#147;H-he&#146;s lost a lot of blood.&#148; He squeaks; sounding more like a boy in 
puberty than a full-grown man. Makoto looks down to see him soil 
himself.

&#147;Ew...&#148; Makoto lowers him to the ground. Looking around, she reaches 
over for a glass of water. She pours it on his white shirt, over the 
belt line. &#147;Now. Don&#146;t tell anyone about this, and we won&#146;t tell 
anyone about...well...have a good one.&#148; She opens the door for him. 
She starts apologizing profusely and walks him out the door. After he 
left, Makoto slams the door. &#147;Stupid bastard.&#148;

&#147;Okay. So you are Makoto.&#148; Wanda mumbles to herself.

&#147;Why isn&#146;t Mr. Mizuno being treated?&#148; Makoto turns on her.

&#147;Don&#146;t get mad at me.&#148; Wanda walks backwards until her knees touch the 
chair. &#147;The blood bank was robbed and so was the expected shipment.&#148;

&#147;Who would want a bunch of blood?&#148; Makoto goes over and sits in the 
wheel chair, ignoring Wanda&#146;s staring. &#147;I feel so helpless...&#148;

&#147;Why?&#148;

&#147;I came-&#147; Makoto stops herself. She clears her throat and tries again. 
&#147;What blood type is Mizuno?&#148;

&#147;Oh positive.&#148;

&#147;That&#146;s great!&#148; Makoto smiles with sudden inspiration. She stands up, 
taking Wanda with her and starts out the door. &#147;I want you to get 
ready for a blood transfusion. Tell the others that you have a match 
and-&#147;

&#147;Wait.&#148; Wanda pulls Makoto to a stop. &#147;You can give blood, yet. Not in 
your condition.&#148;

&#147;Huh? Oh this.&#148; Makoto looks at her already healing cut and shrugs. 
There wasn&#146;t much they could do for it. Her senshi powers would heal 
it soon enough. &#147;So I lost a little blood. I could loose a little 
more.&#148; She pulls Wanda further down the hall and stops. &#147;Now. Where 
are we?&#148; She looks around, spotting a bunch of kids staring at her. 
Wanda starts laughing suddenly.

@;-&gt;--

10 September 2003

Kaya steps off the bus, yawning. She had barely slept last night. &#147;Why 
don&#146;t you just call Makoto?&#148;

&#147;Because if I did, she&#146;ll ask me where I am.&#148; Ami takes her mother&#146;s 
hand and walks towards the hospital. They had had to return the rental 
yesterday so now their mode of transportation is a bus.

&#147;Then why don&#146;t you just tell her?&#148; Kaya kneads her tired eyes, hoping 
it&#146;ll wake her up a little more.

&#147;What do you think she&#146;d do or how she&#146;d...&#148; Ami trails off. The limo 
they had seen was still there, only this time the driver was standing 
outside, grinning at them. &#147;Feel.&#148;

&#147;Ami Mizuno?&#148; The driver grins at them both. Even though he was 
asking, it looked as though he already knew who they were.

&#147;Yes.&#148; Ami replies hesitantly.

&#147;This is for you.&#148; The driver pulls a red rose from behind his back. 
&#147;I hope you like it.&#148; He gives it to Ami and gets inside the limo 
before she could say anything.

&#147;Uh...Thanks.&#148; Ami holds the red rose and allows herself to be lead 
into the hospital. Inside was Wanda, grinning from ear to ear. &#147;Hello, 
Wanda...&#148;

Wanda just continues grinning and gives Ami a white rose. &#147;Happy 
birthday Aims.&#148; Wanda drapes her arm across Ami&#146;s back, prepared to 
lead her to her father when Dr. Parisk walks up to them.

&#147;It&#146;s your birthday?&#148; He asks, going for casual.

&#147;Uh huh.&#148; Ami replies dumbly.

&#147;Well, then. Wait here, I might have something.&#148; Dr. Parisk walks down 
the hall and into his office. On his desk was another rose; a yellow 
rose. He picks it out of the vase and walks back out to give it to 
Ami. &#147;Happy birthday, Miss Mizuno.&#148; Turning back to his charts, he 
walks off.

&#147;Th-thanks.&#148; Ami blushes, looking down at her three roses. She walks 
down the hall and turns left but Wanda tries to pull her right. &#147;I&#146;m 
beginning to feel popular.&#148; She mumbles to herself.

&#147;We had to move your father last night.&#148;

&#147;Oh, god. Is he okay?&#148; Ami&#146;s face suddenly goes pale at the thought of 
her father barely living on-

&#147;He&#146;s better than okay.&#148; Wanda pulls the still frightened looking Ami 
down the halls and into a room. She stops at the door and holds Kaya 
back. She crosses her lips with her finger, an international signal 
for silence. Kaya nods and only then did Wanda let her through.

&#147;Papa?&#148; Ami blinks back tears. She rushes to the other side of the bed 
and sits there. &#147;Are you okay? How are you feeling? Did-&#147;

&#147;I&#146;m fine.&#148; Walter laughs. He turns over and reaches for something in 
his cabinet and gives it to Ami. It was another rose. It was a 
red-tipped pink rose. &#147;Happy birthday, darling. Just add it to your 
collection.&#148;

&#147;Dad...&#148; She puts them all in one hand and throws her arms around him. 
He moans and she pulls back just a quickly. &#147;I&#146;m so sorry. But I-&#147;

&#147;Just help me sit up?&#148; 

&#147;Sorry.&#148; Ami reaches over to help him but he groans again.

&#147;Other side, Ami...&#148; Walter glances over at the grinning Wanda and 
winks.

&#147;Right.&#148; Ami hurries to the other side of the bed and reaches over to 
sit him up. She quickly fluffs the pillow to make him more 
comfortable. &#147;How&#146;s that?&#148;

&#147;Better thanks.&#148; Walter watches Ami through amused eyes, 
anticipating...something.

&#147;What?&#148; Ami smiles warily. She stands up and takes a step back. 
Suddenly an arm snakes around her shoulders, holding a rose under her 
nose. She tenses before astonishment loosens her up. &#147;A blue rose?&#148; 
She takes it gingerly in her hands like a fragile object that could 
break at any moment. Ami turns her head slowly and finds herself 
nose-to-nose, peering into emerald eyes. &#147;Makoto?&#148;

&#147;Happy birthday.&#148; Makoto whispers haughtily. Grinning, she steps back.

&#147;Makoto!&#148; Ami turns and throws her arms around Makoto&#146;s neck. With her 
arms around Ami&#146;s waist, Makoto spins her once then puts her down, 
holding her close. A million questions ran through Ami&#146;s mind. But 
only one kept repeating itself. &#147;What are you doing here?&#148; She pulls 
back, but only enough to clearly see Makoto&#146;s face.

&#147;It&#146;s your birthday.&#148; Makoto brings her hand up and lightly brushes 
Ami&#146;s hair behind her ear. &#147;And I thought you&#146;d want me to be here.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I do.&#148; Ami pulls Makoto into another hug, this time not so 
desperate but more like close friends or casual lovers. &#147;But...why?&#148;

&#147;...Because there no place I would rather be...&#148; Makoto kindly lets go 
of Ami but continues to hold her hand. She turns to face Kaya. Kaya 
looks at her baffled. She just grins and pulls her into a friendly 
hug. Kaya finally laughs and returns it.

&#147;Thank you, Koto.&#148; Ami looks up at Makoto, noticing that her hair was 
messy and she had bags under her eyes. She also notices that Makoto 
was wearing her father&#146;s sweater. &#147;What happened?&#148;

&#147;I had a long trip.&#148; To prove her point, Makoto yawns, her eyes 
suddenly become droopy and the tired grin stays. &#147;I would have got 
here earlier but most all the planes here were already packed.&#148;

&#147;I can&#146;t believe you got on a plane just to get here.&#148; Ami shakes her 
head and pulls Makoto into another hug. This time grateful. 

&#147;Guess wishes came true, after all.&#148; Wanda yawns.

&#147;That&#146;s great.&#148; Makoto yawns. She shakes her head and laughs. &#147;They&#146;re 
contagious I tell ya.&#148; She stifles a giggle when Ami yawns, then Kaya.

&#147;I see.&#148; Ami giggles nervously. The room falls silent, Makoto and 
Wanda grinning tiredly and Kaya and Walter were uncomfortable and Ami 
was...well Ami was grinning too. She shakes her head. &#147;Now I don&#146;t 
know what to do.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; Makoto looks down at Ami, surprised.

&#147;Yeah. Ah...&#148; Ami looks down and frowns. &#147;Why are you wearing your 
uniform?&#148;

&#147;Huh? Oh, ha ha.&#148; Makoto chuckles nervously. &#147;Ah...&#148; What&#146;s she 
supposed to say? [The truth.] She clears her throat. &#147;I&#146;m going to 
steal Ami for a while, okay?&#148; 

&#147;Sure.&#148; Walter starts grinning at her.

&#147;Be sure to feed her.&#148; Kaya demands lightly. &#147;I&#146;m going to talk with 
Walter.&#148; She takes the seat at the bedside and starts talking to him 
in hushed tones.

&#147;Take her.&#148; Wanda shrugs and turns to leave. &#147;I&#146;ve got to go.&#148; She 
stops, turns around and hugs both Makoto and Ami. &#147;Thank you for 
making her happy.&#148; Wanda whispers into Makoto&#146;s ear before leaving.

&#147;We&#146;ll see you later.&#148; Makoto calls back, walking out hand-in-hand 
with Ami. &#147;You haven&#146;t been eating?&#148; She asks her firmly, clearly 
expecting an honest answer.

&#147;Well I have.&#148; But...Ami sighs. &#147;But not much. And I&#146;m having a hard 
time sleeping.&#148; She admits reluctantly. &#145;And I had an anxiety attack 
yesterday.&#146; Ami walks out of the hospital and stops. 

&#147;Come on.&#148; Makoto grins, tugging at her hand.

&#147;Miss Kino.&#148; The driver waves, puts the phone down and walks around to 
open the door.

&#147;What&#146;s wrong?&#148; Makoto takes her other hand and leads her to the limo. 
She gets in first and pulls Ami in after her. The driver closes the 
glass-tinted door. Ami just stares at her in silent question. Makoto 
chuckles, sitting back. &#147;I&#146;ve got my connections.&#148; She shrugs it off 
and casually reaches for the phone. She dials a number and waits for 
someone to pick up. &#147;Ah. Hello...yes.&#148; Makoto glances at Ami. &#147;No...I 
need to-...no!&#148; She chuckles. &#147;Never mind...We might need a place to 
stay for a few days...yes...thank you. You&#146;re a life saver...Yes, I 
love you too...Hnkay...bye.&#148; She hangs up the phone and turns back to 
Ami. &#147;We&#146;ve got a place to stay.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve already got a place to stay.&#148;

&#147;A hotel?&#148;

&#147;Yes.&#148;

&#147;Hm.&#148; Makoto nods. &#147;We&#146;ve got a place to stay.&#148; She repeats in a more 
concrete tone. She pulls Ami towards her and wraps her arms around her 
loosely. She rests her head on tops of Ami&#146;s and closes her eyes.

&#147;Ma&#146;am?&#148;

&#147;Huh?&#148; Makoto opens her eyes. &#147;Oh...somewhere to eat, Dave.&#148;

&#147;...Where?&#148;

&#147;Your pick.&#148; Makoto closes her eyes again. 

&#147;...Yes, ma&#146;am.&#148; He closes the window between them and starts driving.

&#147;Makoto?&#148;

&#147;Hm...&#148;?

&#147;Wh...&#148; Ami feels Makoto&#146;s breathing even up and sighs. She turns 
around so Makoto&#146;s holding her from behind. She looks at Makoto&#146;s bag 
curiously but shrugs it away. She turns back around so that they&#146;re 
both lying across the seat and closes her own eyes. &#147;Thanks...&#148;

@;-&gt;--

&#147;Ma&#146;am?&#148; Dave shakes them both gently. &#147;Makoto...&#148; He grins 
mischievously and plugs Makoto&#146;s nose. She opens her eyes like she was 
awake and looks at him, grinning. He pulls back, blushing. He 
straightens his tie in an attempt to regain his dignity. 
&#147;I...you...food.&#148;

&#147;What?&#148; She looks around the limo and yawns. &#147;This is good.&#148; She 
grins. The last couple of times she woke up were in an old car and a 
beat up truck. &#147;That sounds like a song.&#148; She mumbles.

&#147;You fell asleep.&#148; Ami looks up at Makoto and smiles. &#147;When was the 
last time you slept?&#148;

&#147;Now I know who&#146;s singing...&#148; Makoto grins. She sits up carefully then 
kneads her eyes. &#147;Other than now...sometime yesterday.&#148; She shrugs. 
&#147;What&#146;s for lunch?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ve got you some take-out.&#148; He hands them both a bag of A&amp;W and two 
large drinks. &#147;Two mama burger combos with root beer.&#148; He winks before 
stepping out of the car. He holds the door open. &#147;You can eat it out 
back, Miss Makoto.&#148;

&#147;Thank you Dave. I&#146;d like you to go back and assist Mr and Mrs 
Mizuno.&#148; Makoto gets out of the car first, carrying the pop tray, Ami 
soon after, with the food. They get out of the car and walk through an 
amazingly large yard. 

&#147;Wow.&#148; Ami sighs. She turns around and gasps. Behind them was a huge 
mansion.

&#147;Kino estates.&#148; Makoto replies, watching Ami&#146;s expression curiously.

&#147;Kino...&#148; Ami looks at Makoto with honest to god amazement. She shakes 
her head and laughs. Trying to ignore the mansion, Ami takes Makoto&#146;s 
hand and walks to the table set for two... &#147;Tell me about your little 
journey.&#148; She moves the seat closer to Makoto&#146;s and sits down. 

&#147;I knew you&#146;d ask.&#148; Makoto shuffles uncomfortable. She takes her seat, 
pulling out a little blue book. &#147;This is it.&#148; She takes a deep breath 
and hands it to Ami. &#147;All of it.&#148;

&#147;All.&#148; Ami repeats, taking to book. Makoto hands her fries, too, as 
she starts reading from the beginning.

&#147;I may have rambled a bit in some spots and vague in others, but it&#146;s 
all there.&#148; She starts drinking her pop. &#145;Nervous energy.&#146; Makoto 
assumes.

@;-&gt;--

&#147;You do know that you&#146;re going to have to get back on a few planes, 
right?&#148; Ami asks. She looks up at Makoto, a content smile on her face.

&#147;Yes. But this time I&#146;ll have you with me.&#148; Makoto pushes back Ami&#146;s 
sweat plastered hair and kisses her forehead. &#147;How are you feeling?&#148;

&#147;A little sore.&#148; Ami rests her head on Makoto&#146;s glistening chest and 
yawns. 

&#147;I&#146;m sorry-&#147;

&#147;It&#146;s alright. You were gentle, Koto.&#148; Ami whispers against Makoto&#146;s 
lips. She slides her head down to rest on Makoto&#146;s shoulders. Right 
now, they were outside, naked except for each other and a blanket. Ami 
was straddling Makoto who was holding onto her in a loose but firm 
embrace.

&#147;Why do you call me Koto?&#148; Makoto asks idly.

&#147;I...heard your father call you that and...I guess it just stuck.&#148; Ami 
pulls back so she could clearly look at Makoto. &#147;Do you want me to 
stop?&#148;

&#147;No.&#148; Makoto kisses the tip of Ami&#146;s nose and pulls her closer. 
Together, they watch the sun set before turning in. The sun itself was 
a thick orange and the sky glowed red, orange, yellow and pink before 
it started going dark. Makoto lays Ami down in the bed and covers her 
up. With the blanket wrapped around her shoulders, she turns to leave.

&#147;Don&#146;t.&#148; Ami reaches out and takes Makoto&#146;s hand. &#147;Don&#146;t leave me. 
Stay.&#148; 

&#147;But...&#148; Makoto glances back, her resolve dissolving. With a tired 
smile, Makoto walks around the bed and gets in on the other side. Both 
she and Ami move closer so they were both lying in the middle, in each 
other&#146;s arms. &#147;You&#146;re stuck with me now, Aims.&#148;

&#147;I wouldn&#146;t have it any other way.&#148; Ami mumbles into the blankets.

&#147;I think I&#146;m in love with you.&#148; Makoto kisses the top of Ami&#146;s head 
and strokes her arm affectionately. She sighs. &#145;It&#146;s too early. Far to 
early.&#146; Makoto takes Ami&#146;s hand and entwines their fingers, loosening 
her up. 

&#147;Do you mean it?&#148; There was no room for hesitation.

&#147;With all my heart and soul.&#148; Makoto looks down at Ami. &#147;I&#146;m in love 
with you, Mizuno Ami.&#148;

&#147;And I you, Kino Makoto.&#148; Ami leans up and presses her lips to 
Makoto&#146;s. &#147;I&#146;m so in love with you.&#148;
