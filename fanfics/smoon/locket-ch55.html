<h1>Arisugawa's Locket (part 55 of 88)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/locket-ch54.html">Back to Part 54</a><pre>        Bones looked up, smiling slightly as she saw the black clad 
woman walking up to the door. She smiled slightly, &quot;Welcome back, Cyber 
Six.&quot;

        The black leather hugged her thin form, a large hat partially 
concealing her face. Blood red lips teased up in a smile, &quot;Bones, good 
evening.&quot; Cyber Six tipped her head to the side, &quot;Has there been any 
trouble lately?&quot;

        &quot;Nothing major,&quot; Bones drawled. She tilted her head to the side 
as the woman passed her, &quot;Have you ever thought about coming here in 
your Adrian outfit?&quot;

        Cyber Six blinked in surprise as she stopped to ask, &quot;Why?&quot;

        Bones chuckled softly, &quot;You&#39;d look pretty cute in it, I bet. 
Probably have to beat the girls off you with a stick.&quot;

        &quot;I have enough trouble with the girl I have, thanks,&quot; Cyber Six 
shot over her shoulder as she headed inside.

        &quot;Welcome to Arisugawa&#39;s Locket,&quot; Merle beamed, the catgirl 
looking remarkably cute dressed up in a school girl&#39;s uniform.

        &quot;Hey Merle,&quot; a smiling Cyber Six removed her cape, folding it up 
before passing it over to her with her hat. &quot;So where&#39;s Hitomi this 
evening?&quot; she asked curiously, running her hand through her spikey black 
hair.

        &quot;Studying for exams,&quot; the catgirl flicked her ears back as Merle 
continued, &quot;Hitomi asked Juri for a few days off to prepare.&quot;

        Cyber Six nodded to herself thoughtfully as she considered the 
usual suspects, &quot;Let me guess, Ami Mizuno&#39;s helping her study?&quot;

        Merle nodded, &quot;Yup. She&#39;s in good hands.&quot;

        &quot;See you later,&quot; Cyber Six gave the girl a smile, moving through 
the crowd. The woman in black leather moved confidently, exchanging nods 
with acquaintances and various friends. She reached the bar, smiling at 
the blue haired twins behind the bar.

        Ryouko gave her a look through cat-like eyes as her long hair 
bounced down her back. She frowned, taking in her customer&#39;s pale face 
as she worriedly asked, &quot;You need sustenance?&quot;

        &quot;Yes, please,&quot; Cyber Six made a face.

        She bent down, grabbing a vial of a green glowing fluid then 
pouring it out in a thick mug. &quot;Drink fast,&quot; Ryouko said, pushing the 
drink towards Cyber Six.

        Cyber Six took the glass and slugged it down, her face twisting 
at the awful taste. She shuddered visible, breath raspy, but in a few 
moments recovered. She pushed sweaty hair out of her face and gave 
Ryouko a weary smile, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m glad Washu was able to artificially create that stuff,&quot; 
Minagi noted, the scarred twin wiping out a glass, &quot;but you&#39;d think Mom 
could cure you, too.&quot;

        Cyber Six shrugged, &quot;She told me that she could, but only by 
removing most of my enhancements. With Jose still on the loose, I can&#39;t 
do that.&quot;

        &quot;So how are things in Meridian now?&quot; Minagi asked curiously, 
pouring her a glass of beer to wash the taste away.

        Cyber Six puffed out a breath before quietly admitting, &quot;I think 
I may have done something very stupid.&quot;

        &quot;Oh?&quot; Ryouko leaned forward eagerly beside her sister.

        Cyber Six rolled her eyes at them, &quot;You two are terrible.&quot; She 
sipped some of her beer before continuing, &quot;Von Reichter tried to 
destroy the city with a living bomb and I didn&#39;t think I could survive 
stopping it.&quot;

        &quot;You figured you were on a kamikaze run,&quot; Minagi prompted her.

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Cyber Six nodded. &quot;There&#39;s been a student who&#39;s had a 
bad crush on my Adrian identity, her name&#39;s Lori Anderson,&quot; she drank a 
bit more, &quot;and before I went to face Von Reichter, I revealed my secret 
identity to her.&quot;

        &quot;Ouch,&quot; Ryouko chuckled softly at that, &quot;and since you survived 
this little adventure, you&#39;re going to have to deal with it.&quot;

        Cyber Six nodded glumly, &quot;I&#39;ve taken a few sick days, but I 
can&#39;t do that forever.&quot;

        &quot;So what does this girl think of Cyber Six?&quot; Minagi asked 
curiously, Ryouko having moved to attend to a customer&#39;s order.

        &quot;Hates her guts,&quot; Cyber Six said with a sigh, &quot;though I think it 
was because she believed that Adrian and Cyber Six were having an 
affair.&quot;

        Minagi couldn&#39;t help it, she began to laugh. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she wiped 
her eyes, &quot;but it&#39;s quite the mental image, you trying to have an affair 
with yourself.&quot;

        &quot;Fair enough,&quot; Cyber Six agreed.

        &quot;Good evening,&quot; the smooth voice came from just behind her. 
Cyber Six turned around to see the tall, orange haired woman who gave 
her a slight smile. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you here again,&quot; Arisugawa Juri 
said.

        &quot;Juri-san,&quot; Cyber Six said to her respectfully. She smiled 
slightly, &quot;We were just discussing my latest folly.&quot; She quietly 
summarized the situation as a visibly amused Juri settled down into a 
seat beside them.

        Juri nodded slightly as Cyber Six finished. &quot;Here&#39;s a question 
for you,&quot; Juri asked with a smile, &quot;why do you think Lori was attracted 
to Adrian?&quot;

        &quot;Huh?&quot; Cyber Six looked confused.

        Ryouko smirked as she said to Juri, &quot;You&#39;re wondering if Lori 
might have been attracted to some of her feminine qualities, right?&quot;

        &quot;I hadn&#39;t thought of that,&quot; Cyber Six admitted softly. She drank 
a bit more beer, savoring the taste before saying, &quot;I have to say I 
wasn&#39;t exactly butch as Adrian. It&#39;s possible....&quot;

        &quot;Not that I&#39;m suggesting confessing your love to her,&quot; Juri 
cautioned, &quot;I&#39;m sure Lori is feeling pretty confused right about now.&quot;

        &quot;Not to mention being confused myself,&quot; Cyber Six said with a 
ghost of a smile.

        Juri looked up, seeing two familiar figures walking in. She gave 
Cyber Six an apologetic smile, &quot;Excuse me.&quot;

        Haruka smiled wryly as Juri approached her. &quot;Setsuna sent us to 
tell you she&#39;s going to be late,&quot; the slim blonde said apologetically.

        &quot;What happened?&quot; Juri frowned.

        &quot;Hotaru got into trouble for fighting,&quot; Michiru explained, the 
green haired woman standing closely with her lover.

        &quot;Hotaru?&quot; Juri looked shocked. Hotaru was normally one of the 
most mature girls Juri knew, mature far beyond her years. &quot;How did that 
happen?&quot; she asked.

        &quot;It&#39;s a long story,&quot; Haruka said as the three settled around a 
table.

        May strode over, her long brown hair flowing down her back. 
&quot;What can I get you?&quot; she asked them politely.

        &quot;My regular,&quot; Juri said, &quot;whiskey for Haruka and wine cooler for 
Michiru.&quot; With that May was gone, returning in moments with the order.

        &quot;Thanks,&quot; Haruka took a drink from her whiskey, &quot;Hotaru gave a 
presentation to her class about her family today.&quot;

        &quot;Not Prof. Tomoe,&quot; Michiru drank some of her cooler, &quot;but 
Haruka, myself and Juri. Apparently some of her classmates weren&#39;t 
prepared to deal with Hotaru having two mommies.&quot;

        &quot;Marvelous,&quot; Juri scowled.

        &quot;Someone was taunting her about us at lunch,&quot; Haruka sounded 
kind of proud as she continued, &quot;and apparently she felt she had to 
defend our honor.&quot;

        &quot;Haruka,&quot; Michiru scolded her lover. She looked over at Juri to 
add, &quot;Setsuna went over to talk to the teacher and smooth things over, 
somewhat.&quot;
