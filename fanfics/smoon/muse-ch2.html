<h1>Muse (part 2 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/muse-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Later that night, Makoto lay with her arms folded behind her head, and 
stared at the ceiling. The apartment wasn&#146;t fully dark, as they never 
are in cities, and she could clearly make out Ami&#146;s form against the 
light from the street. Ami&#146;s soft breathing tickled Makoto&#146;s face, but 
she didn&#146;t move, finding her lover&#146;s proximity comforting.

She thought back to their first meeting, to the day that Usagi had 
introduced them. She remembered the curious blush on the smaller 
girl&#146;s face. Makoto could feel herself smile in response to the 
memory. She had purred, ostensibly at Luna, &quot;Cute kitty.&quot; and Ami had 
seen right through her ploy. Still, nothing might have come of it if 
Ami hadn&#146;t dropped that notebook. Her thoughts drifted to that day...


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


&quot;Tomorrow same time!&quot; 

&quot;Okay!&quot; Makoto waved to Usagi over her shoulder as she headed down the 
Shrine stairs after Ami and Minako. As usual the blonde had flung 
herself headlong down the stairs and was pulling away rapidly. Ami 
moved more sedately, her head buried in a book as she walked, already 
studying for her cram school. Makoto watched her, noting the tilt of 
her neck, the way she moved. She knew Ami well enough to know that 
their resident genius was miles away - probably memorizing formulae 
for a test.

Makoto sighed and looked at her watch. &quot;Ami, &quot; she called out, &quot;It&#39;s 
almost 4 o&#146;clock - don&#146;t you have to be at school early today?&quot; With a 
jerk, Ami looked up at her, then down at her own watch, her face 
turning red.

&quot;Oh! I&#146;m late! Thanks Mako-chan!&quot; And swiftly she began to take the 
steps two at a time, heading for the bus station at the bottom of the 
hill.

Makoto sighed again and put her hands behind her head. She had nowhere 
in particular to go to, no where to rush off to...the thought 
depressed her slightly. She put it out of her mind. It was a beautiful 
day, maybe she would pack herself a snack and take it out to the 
park...

As she reached the bottom of the stairs, she noticed a small notebook 
laying face down on the pavement, its pages open and bent. She leaned 
over and picked it up. The handwriting was clearly Ami&#146;s - she must 
have dropped it as she sprinted for the bus.

&quot;I&#146;ll return it tomorrow.&quot; Makoto said out loud, then without 
consciously meaning to pry, gazed at the words on the open page. 
Expecting it to be English, or Math, Makoto meant simply to glance at 
it. But as her eyes scanned the words, she stopped walking and her 
mouth opened in shock.

 

 

Lose Control


What is it about you that affects me so?
The play of sunlight on burnished auburn hair,
The storm-fire glitter in your eyes,
The touch of your fingers and
The heat of your breath?
I don&#39;t know.
That scares me more than it should.
Every moment with you leaves me weak;
Help me... I can&#39;t stop shivering.
My legs tremble at the merest thought,
My heart beats wildly,
Imprisoned.
Lying here in the warm, still night,
Wandering helplessly,
Desire my only guide.
I burn for you.
You make me forget who I am;
You make me lose control.
Lose myself.
You dance through my dreams,
The ghost of a beautiful warrior,
And I,
Lonely and beguiled,
Can only follow

 

Makoto stood, staring at the words, and read them again. There could 
be no doubt about the meaning of the poem. She knew Ami wrote poetry, 
of course, they all knew that, but this.... Her breath rasping and 
heavy, Makoto read the poem a third time. Auburn hair? Storm-fire 
glitter? She couldn&#146;t possibly mean...?

In all honesty, Makoto remonstrated with herself then. Later she would 
worry if she had done the improper thing, if she had been impossibly 
rude, but at that moment she had to know. She began at the beginning 
of the notebook and read a few more lines of Ami&#146;s poetry. From the 
date inside the book&#146;s cover, Ami had written these snippets in the 
month or so after they had met. That would be nearly a year and a half 
ago now, although it seemed much, much longer. 

 

Breathless

Tower of strength, 
Storm that washes all clean
You scour me, leaving me 
breathless in your wake

and again, on the same page

Like emeralds your eyes shine when you laugh
Like the sun on leaves after the rain

Makoto felt the heat rise from her neck up her face. There was no 
doubt in her mind at all, now. She felt terrible about intruding, 
but... &quot;I can&#146;t stand here and read it.&quot; Her own voice startled her 
out of her reverie and she looked around guiltily. Well, at least Ami 
didn&#146;t see me read it. If I return it to her tonight, she&#146;ll never 
know. With a shock, Makoto realized that that was the most untrue 
thing she had ever thought. Ami would know just by looking at her. She 
squirmed internally thinking of looking into Ami&#146;s trusting face, but 
she had to know. She had to know what was written in this book!

Makoto got on the bus clutching at the little notebook. Her head down, 
lost in her own thoughts, she almost missed her own bus stop.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Makoto sat down on her futon and with fumbling fingers began to read 
the poetry, short stories and snippets of thought the notebook 
contained. She lay there reading, never noticing time slip away, or 
darkness falling outside. When she at last looked up, she noted with a 
creeping feeling that it was too late now to attempt to return the 
notebook to Ami. She&#146;d have to give it to her tomorrow at school.

Makoto looked down once more at the last entry in the book, dated that 
very day, and a flush of red colored her cheeks. Ami&#146;s writing had 
become more focused, more precise. But the subject matter had never 
altered.

In a breathless whisper, Makoto read out loud:

A shock runs through me as you lower your lips to mine,
a spark of life that animates me
The current that passes between us makes me whole,
as we blend into one another
I am your canvas, you are my creator
Your hands paint me into existence
Your thought shapes me
My face, my back, my arms all come to life with a touch
My breasts, my stomach, my legs infused with your spirit
I remain partial until your hands enter me, 
and then I am alive, filled with your power

Makoto stared at the page below her, no longer seeing the characters, 
nor the inscription below it, conscious only of the title - Supreme 
Thunder.

How long she sat there lost in thought, or even what she was thinking, 
Makoto could not say, but the doorbell startled her out of her trance. 
Glancing at the clock, she could see that it was nearly 10, and too 
late for anyone to drop by for a casual visit.

Glancing through the peephole made the hair stand up on Makoto&#146;s neck. 
Ami, obviously on her way home from cram school, stood outside. She 
was standing with her arms folded across her chest, clutching her 
books, making herself clearly visible to the apartment&#146;s occupant. 
Makoto stared for a moment, then pulled herself away and searched the 
apartment frantically. She was caught and there was no escape. The 
notebook burned in her hand.

Makoto stood, her hand on the doorknob, paralyzed with overwhelming 
and conflicting emotions. Perhaps she should sneak away, avoid Ami 
tomorrow at school, and just dump the notebook into Ami&#146;s locker 
anonymously. Or she could lie and...no, Makoto shook her head with 
disgust. What an ridiculous thought! Like she could ever lie to Ami 
about this. Like she could lie convincingly at all. It is always 
better to face your fears, Makoto could remember her mother telling 
her. She put her hand resolutely on the doorknob and gave it a tug 
before her resolve could dissipate.

Ami gave her usual shy smile in answer to Makoto&#146;s greeting and 
entered in response to her gesture, but Makoto could see instantly 
that there was something on her mind. Makoto offered tea, but Ami 
refused - a surprising breach of etiquette for her.

There was a moment of silence as Ami looked at the ground obviously 
trying to gather her thoughts. Makoto unstrung by unfamiliar emotions 
and unable to find a more polite form of address, blurted out, &quot;I have 
your notebook.&quot; She lowered her eyes and held the object in front of 
her.

Ami spoke quickly. &quot;Oh! Good! I wondered where I had lost it.&quot; Her 
tone of voice was intended to sound cheerful, but it the execution 
fell far short of the intention.

Makoto opened her mouth, trying to find something to say, but was 
interrupted by a sob. She glanced up at Ami and was horrified to find 
that she was backing away towards the door, her eyes brimming with 
tears. Makoto reached out and tried to grab her hand, but Ami backed 
away another step. Makoto stepped forward, and Ami retreated again.

&quot;I&#146;m sorry, I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Ami repeated as she moved towards the door. &quot;I 
thought I could do it, but I can&#146;t.&quot;

&quot;Wait! Ami-chan! Don&#146;t go.&quot; This time her grab for the shorter girl&#146;s 
wrist was successful and she halted Ami&#146;s retreat.

Ami stood as if reading herself for the executioner&#146;s axe. Makoto let 
her hand loosen around Ami&#146;s wrist, but did not break contact.

&quot;I&#146;m the one who should apologize Ami-chan. I had no right to read it, 
none at all. I&#146;m the one to blame.&quot; Makoto spoke with passion, as a 
drive built, almost imperceptibly, within her to bring the smile back 
to Ami&#146;s face. She continued to speak, while Ami stared at the floor. 
&quot;I should have run to catch up with you, not even looked at one page. 
If there is anyone here at fault, its me.&quot;

Ami said nothing.

&quot;Please don&#146;t be angry with me, Ami-chan. I&#146;m, well, I&#146;m only human, 
and I saw a poem and read it, and by the time I finished, I wanted to 
know...I wanted to know who you were writing about, who it was you 
loved so much.&quot; Makoto fell silent as one single tear dropped from 
Ami&#146;s bowed head to the floor below. &quot;I&#146;m sorry Ami-chan!&quot; Makoto 
almost yelled in desperation, mortified at Ami&#146;s reaction to her 
confession.

&quot;No, Mako-chan, no.&quot; When Ami spoke her voice was soft, almost a 
whisper. She lifted her head and looked at Makoto&#146;s stricken face. 
&quot;I&#146;m the one who should apologize. If I didn&#146;t want you to find it, I 
shouldn&#146;t have dropped it there.&quot;

Makoto gazed down at the shorter girl, momentarily silent with shock. 
&quot;You mean...you...&quot;

Ami nodded, then reached up and brushed away the moisture from her 
eyes. &quot;I shouldn&#146;t have done it. I thought I&#146;d be okay if you were 
angry, but I&#146;m not. I&#146;m scared either way. I didn&#146;t know how to tell 
you. I still don&#146;t. I&#146;m sorry Mako-chan, I shouldn&#146;t even have written 
those poems. But from the very first time I saw you...&quot; she fell 
silent. Looking at Makoto&#146;s hand still clasping her wrist she shook 
her head slowly. &quot;I&#146;m a fool. And a perverted one, I guess. I&#146;m sorry 
Mako-chan, you&#146;re probably not going to want to be around me much now. 
I&#146;ll understand that. I just hope we can still work together as 
Senshi. Though it may take some time, please forgive me.&quot; She 
disengaged her hand from Makoto&#146;s grasp and turned towards the door.

Ami took one step when she felt herself crudely jerked around to face 
Makoto again. She could see the anger in the taller girl&#146;s face and 
suddenly felt fear infuse her, settling low in her stomach. Ami had 
seen Makoto angry before, but never at her, or any one of their 
friends. 

&quot;You are not leaving here! Not yet.&quot; Makoto&#146;s eyes were hard and Ami 
shrank from them. &quot;You set me up for this and now you&#146;re just 
leaving?&quot; Her voice was growing harsh with anger. Suddenly she seemed 
to notice Ami&#146;s fright and stopped herself. 

&quot;I&#146;m sorry.&quot; Makoto ran a hand over her face in an effort to regain 
her composure. &quot;I seem to be making things worse.&quot; She released Ami&#146;s 
shoulder and gestured once again to the interior of the apartment, 
&quot;Won&#146;t you please come sit with me?&quot;

Ami moved into the apartment carefully, and perched nervously on the 
edge of the sofa. Makoto shook her head. &quot;I&#146;m not doing this very 
well, Ami-chan. I&#146;m sorry. I&#146;ve never been good at communicating - 
that was why I always got into fights. I guess I&#146;ve never been good at 
expressing myself. Not like you. Those poems were, well, they were 
beautiful. I&#146;m jealous, I really am. And I&#146;m amazed. I can&#146;t imagine 
that you&#146;d want to write about me... Oh, I&#146;m not saying this right!&quot; 
Makoto gave a frustrated sigh, looked at her hands in her lap and sat, 
her shoulders bowed. 

Ami looked across the sofa at her, astonishment in her gaze. &quot;You 
mean, you&#146;re not angry with me?&quot;

&quot;Well, no, I mean yes, I am angry at you but not because of the 
poems.&quot; Makoto met her eyes. &quot;I&#146;m angry because you didn&#146;t tell me 
sooner, and because, after letting me see those poems, you were about 
to deny them and walk away.&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Ami spoke firmly. &quot;I was about to walk away, yes, but I would 
never deny what I wrote in that notebook. I meant every word.&quot; Her 
eyes flashed, challenging Makoto to dispute her words.

&quot;Even that last poem?&quot; Makoto felt a small smile beginning to form at 
the corners of her lips.

&quot;Especially that last poem...&quot; Ami said, leaning forward slightly, 
subtlely challenging Makoto. Makoto found herself moving towards Ami 
in response. The distance between them closed slowly. Ami&#146;s eyes, 
still challenging, softened. Makoto met Ami&#146;s gaze and felt something 
hard in herself dissolve and flow away. Walls she hadn&#146;t even known 
she had built, crumbled and blew away like so much dust. 

They paused, savoring this moment, suspending it into an eternity. 
Looking into Ami&#146;s eyes, Makoto felt herself moving inexorably into 
those infinite fields of blue, deep as the heavens. She didn&#146;t want 
this moment to end. She could feel her anger alter, becoming 
anticipation, then an excitement she had never before experienced. She 
knew she stood at a crossroads that would forever change her life. A 
life that, perhaps, might contain as much happiness as her first 16 
years had contained bitterness. 

Their lips touched gingerly. Makoto reached out haltingly to draw Ami 
towards her. Ami allowed herself to be pulled forward into an embrace, 
melting into Makoto&#146;s arms, a small sigh escaping her. Their lips 
pressed together more strongly and Makoto knew, without reservation 
that for this moment she had been born. Not to become a Senshi, or 
save the world as Sailor Jupiter, but to be a woman, and find love in 
the arms of Mizuno Ami.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Makoto leaned down and kissed Ami&#146;s sleeping form on the ear. Wrapping 
the smaller figure in her arms, Makoto laid her head against Ami&#146;s 
hair, closed her eyes, and still smiling with the memory of their 
first kiss, slept.
