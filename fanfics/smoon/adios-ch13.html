<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 13 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>The days passed uneventful for the senshi. Ever since that incedent 
with Mitsuakai and Sailor Moon, there had been no attacks.

Rei had been the only one Minako told about Makoto leaving. Minako had 
confessed to Rei nearly everything. Excluding, of course, their past 
together and who Makoto and Ace truely were.

&quot;Man, oh, man,&quot; Rei said leaning back into the couch in Makoto&#39;s 
apartment. &quot;So, after she left she let you have evrything here?&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot; Minako sat in the recliner next to the couch, 
staring down at the coffee table.

Rei sat there, dumb struck. &quot;She didn&#39;t say why she left?&quot;

::flash back::

&quot;I&#39;ve decided to leave,&quot; Makoto said, looking down towards the street.

&quot;Nani!?&quot; Minako looked at her in disbelief. &quot;Makoto, you can&#39;t leave 
now...&quot;

&quot;I have to, Minako. If I don&#39;t, I will hurt other people. I may even 
kill them. You know I have to do this.&quot;

Tears began to run down Minako&#39;s face. &quot;Mako-chan...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll leave in the morning. You can pretend you didn&#39;t know..&quot;

&quot;Iie! I will not act like you left,&quot; Minako said angerily. &quot;I will not 
pretend because you will not leave. As the leader of the senshi, I 
forbid it!&quot;

Makoto just turned and raised her eyebrow, looking at Minako. &quot;I don&#39;t 
think so. I&#39;m leaving in the morning. You can&#39;t change my mind.&quot;

::end of flash back::

&quot;Iie,&quot; Minako lied. &quot;No, she just said she was leaving.&quot;

Rei sighed heavily. &quot;Ya know, Mina-chan. I knew for a while you liked 
Makoto-san. But I never knew this would result from it. I never knew 
you were a les-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m bi, Rei-chan,&quot; Minako cut in quickly. 

&quot;Still, I never knew.&quot;

&quot;I know. I didn&#39;t want any one to know,&quot; Minako said quietly. &quot;I was 
afraid you wouldn&#39;t accept me. Even as a senshi.&quot;

Rei looked at her friend. &quot;Iie. I know I wouldn&#39;t. I&#39;d always accept 
you. And I know Usagi will.&quot; Then Rei stopped.

Minako looked up at her. &quot;But not Ami, ne?&quot;

Rei sat there. &quot;I don&#39;t know, Mina-chan. She and Mako-chan didn&#39;t ge 
along because she was a lesbian. She seemed to not have a problem with 
her until then.&quot;

Minako nodded and Rei smiled warmly. Placing her hand on Minako&#39;s knee 
she whispered, &quot;Don&#39;t worry, Mina-chan. I won&#39;t tell either one of 
them.&quot;

Minako smiled.

------------------------------------------------------------

Four senshi and one tiger warrior stood in the arcade after midnight, 
staring at a dark hole. 

&quot;Good work, Mercury,&quot; Venus said.

&quot;Hai,&quot; Sailor Moon said. &quot;Maybe we can get Mamo-chan back now.&quot;

Yung hu shook his head. He knew better.

&quot;Well,&quot; Mars said. &quot;What are we waiting for?&quot;

~This used to be my playground 
This used to be my childhood dream
This used to be the place I ran to
Whenever I was in need
Of a friend
Why did it have to end~

After jumping thru the portal, the five warriors and the two felines 
began to run towards the end of the tunnel they had appeared in. Yung 
Hu, because of how his body was, could not run like a human and had to 
run on all fours. He occasionally had to stop to wait for the others 
to catch up.

When the tunnel divided up into three seperate ones, they split; the 
senshi took one, the guardians took another and Yung Hu took one 
alone.

When the senshi took their tunnel, they were attacked by Kunzite. 

&quot;Well, well. How nice of you to deliever the crystal to us, Moon 
brat!&quot;

The other senshi stepped in front of Sailor Moon, protecting her. 

&quot;Get bent,&quot; Sailor Moon called out.

Kunzite sneared. &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, Sailor Moon,&quot; he said as he 
watched her ready her cresent wand. &quot;I&#39;ll waste you just like we 
wasted your mother!&quot;

Sailor Moon stared at him in shock. &quot;N-nani?!?&quot;

&quot;Thats right,&quot; Kunzite said cruelly. &quot;Queen Serenity died protecty you 
and damned crystal, only to have you give it to us now!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lying!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out, tears staining her face. &quot;She 
would never send bastards like you into the future with us!&quot;

&quot;Are you calling me a liar?&quot; Kunzite didn&#39;t give them a chance to 
answer. He formed two neon pink boomerangs in his hands and threw them 
towards the Senshi.

Not expecting the attack, the senshi were taken back, and Sailor Moon 
lost the wand. 

&quot;No!!&quot;

Kunzite smiled evilly as he reached out for it. It recoiled and hit 
his hand before glowing brightly and swallowing itself and the senshi.

Kunzite stood in the cold, dark tunnel alone. Wondering what had just 
happened.

~And why do they always say
&quot;Don&#39;t look back
Keep your head held high
Don&#39;t ask them why
Because life is short
And before you know
You&#39;re feeling old
And your heart is breaking
Don&#39;t hold on to the past&quot;
Well that&#39;s too much to ask~

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Where...where are we,&quot; Sailor Moon asked.

&quot;Why, Serenity, you&#39;re home,&quot; said a voice above the senshi. The four 
wariors watched in awe as a small glowing light approached them from 
up above. As it neared the grounded, Sailor Moon knealed with it.

&quot;How did you know my name,&quot; Sailor Moon asked, looking at the small 
light as it subsided to reveal a woman that resembled Usagi, except 
older with silver hair.

The woman smiled warmly. &quot;My Serenity, you have not changed at all. 
Still as curious as a kitten. I am not surprised you do not remeber 
me. Thats how I wanted it.&quot;

Sailor moon and the other senshi looked at her in shock. &quot;You&#39;re-&quot;

The woamn nodded. &quot;Hai. I am Ruler of the Silver Millenium, Queen 
Serenity.&quot;

&quot;Then that means we are on the moon,&quot; Venus said.

~Live and learn
Well the years they flew
And we never knew
We were foolish then
We would never tire
And that little fire
Is still alive in me
It will never go away
Can&#39;t say goodbye to yesterday~

Memories flooded the Senshis&#39; minds of the past. Happy, sad, 
fearful...any and all memories were returned. Most were foggy, but as 
they led up to the final battle, the visons became more clearer.

::flashback::

Five young girls of 14 sat in the study of the library, listening to a 
small black cat talk about...something. They had all tuned out and 
began to do their own thing five minutes into the lecture and couldn&#39;t 
pass a pop quiz if they were given one that minute. 

The princesses of Venus and Jupiter sat in the back laughing and 
giggleing about something. In front of them, sharing a table of their 
own, the princesses of the Moon and Mars were making horrid faces at 
the black cat when her head was turned. And Princess Mercury sat at 
the first table alone, reading a book.

growling in the back of her throat, Luna eyed the five girls. Mostly 
the four behind Mercury. Pouncing on Mercury&#39;s table, she yelled, 
&quot;Will you all shut up!&quot;

The five girls all looked at Luna as if she had lost her mind. 

&quot;Come on, Luna,&quot; Venus said. &quot;Can we please cut studies today? We 
haven&#39;t had a day off in ages. We&#39;re restless.&quot;

&quot;Hai,&quot; the others chimed, all save Mercury who went back to reading 
her book.

&quot;I agree,&quot; said a kind voice. The girls and the cat looked up to see a 
smiling Queen Serenity. 

&quot;Your Majesty,&quot; Luna asked.

&quot;Let them have the day off. They will be more calm tomorrow,&quot; she 
said, her smile still growing.

Luna sighed and nodded. The girls cheered and jumped up from their 
seats and quickly walked passed the Queen, saying their thanks. 
Jupiter, however, stayed behind. 

She walked over to Mercury and gently pulled the book down and smiled. 
&quot;Well, there *is* a person in there after all!&quot;

Mercury smiled, cleared her throat and continued to read. Jupiter 
smiled evilly. &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to come outside with us, Ami-chan? Or 
are you too good for us?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll burn.&quot; Mercury tried to hold in her smile. She knew how Jupiter 
was, always flirting.

&quot;Well, I&#39;ll just dump water on you then,&quot; Jupiter said, smiling.

Mercury closed her book and looked up at Jupiter. &quot;Makoto-san-&quot;

&quot;Mako-chan, please.&quot;

Mercury smiled. &quot;Fine. Mako-chan, What will it take for you to 
understand that I don&#39;t want to go outside?&quot;

Jupiter looked as if she were thinking. &quot;Nothing.&quot;

Mercury rolled her eyes, failing to hide her smile, and reopened her 
book.

&quot;That is rude, you know, Ami.&quot;

&quot;As are you, Makoto-san.&quot; Mercury peered over her book, then looked 
back down.

&quot;Ok, you asked for it,&quot; Jupiter said.

&quot;Nani?..AH! Makoto! Put me down!&quot;

Jupiter laughed as she picked Mercury up and began to walk out of the 
library with her in her arms. &quot;Iie.&quot;

~No regrets
But I wish that you
Were here with me
Well then there&#39;s hope yet
I can see your face
In our secret place
You&#39;re not just a memory
Say goodbye to yesterday 
Those are words I&#39;ll never say~ 

&quot;We&#39;re being attacked!!&quot;

&quot;To the armory! Quickly!&quot;

Panic raced thru the crowd as the news spread like wild fire that the 
Negaverse was attacking. The ground shook violently as guests ran home 
or to transports to get to their own planets.

The senshi ran outside, and stood ready. They watched as they saw a 
black cloud coming from the Earth grow larger and larger. As the 
ominus cloud drew closer, the moon shook more violently. The Moon 
Princess was locked away inside, so she would be safe, but only if 
they could stop the enemy here and now.

All at once, the cloud stopped moving. The moon stopped shaking. But 
the senshi took fighting stances. An erie silence overcame them. And 
then, a loud rumbeling noise erupted as two orbs appeared from the 
cloud, forming eyes.

The last thing the senshi heard was their fellow senshi crying out.

::end flashback::

~This used to be my playground
This used to be our pride and joy
This used to be the place we ran to
That no one in the world could dare destroy 

This used to be our playground 
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
I wish you were standing here with me~

------------------------------------------------------------

Reality came crashing back to the senshi.

&quot;She died to save us,&quot; Venus said, tears in her eyes. The others 
nodded their heads. They couldn&#39;t find their voices to speak in fear 
of crying themselves.

&quot;Well,&quot; Sailor Moon said, swallowing her tears. &quot;I refuse to let her 
dream die. I will destroy Beryl...&quot;

&quot;And we&#39;ll help you,&quot; Mars said, determination in her voice. Mercury 
and venus nodded in agreement.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sailor moon said, smiling slightly.

There was silence for a few moments before a pair of screams made them 
turn their heads.

&quot;Luna!!&quot;

&quot;Artemis!!&quot;

Mars and Mercury followed Moon and Venus as they ran down the tunnel. 
They began to see a light form at the end and three forms in the 
light.

&quot;Leave them alone,&quot; Venus cried out, tears streaking her face.

Kunzite looked up, snearing. &quot;Why should I?&quot;

&quot;Cause she said so!&quot; Kunzite turned and was pounced by Yung hu. Yung 
Hu dug his talons deep into Kunzite&#39;s shoulders, drawing blood. His 
eyes glowed a fierce green. 

Kunzite placed his hands on Yung Hu&#39;s ribs and blew him away. Yung Hu 
hit the cave wall and slumped over. He stood, but weakly.

&quot;You stupid gargoyle! Did you honestly think you could beat me?&quot;

Yung Hu lifted his head and smiled. &quot;Iie. I didn&#39;t think *I* could..&quot;

Kunzite heard the emphisis on his words and turned his head. The four 
senshi had formed a circle and were calling out their transformation 
incantaions.

&quot;Mercury Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Mars Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Venus Power, Make-Up!&quot;

&quot;Moon Prism Power, Make-up!&quot;

Four lights shot form the girls&#39; bodies, and it was directed at 
Kunzite. It flung him against the wall and held him there, but it 
wasn&#39;t enough to kill him. 

&quot;Foolisih girls,&quot; he said as they continued to attack him.

Yung Hu knew they wouldn&#39;t be able to win this way with out Jupiter. 
But, maybe he could help...

Yung Hu roared and formed an energy ball in his hands. He shot it 
towards the light that was coming from the senshi nd it crackled like 
lightening around their rainbow beam. It hit Kunzite harder and he 
gasped in pain.

The senshi stopped their attack, weak and drained. They turned to see 
Kunzite who only smiled at them. He then fell forward, vanishing 
before hitting the ground.

He was dead.

~This used to be our playground 
This used to be our great escape
This used to be the place we ran to
This used to be our secret hiding place 
This used to be our playground 
This used to be our childhood dream
This used to be the place we ran to
The best things in life are always free
Wishing you were here with me...~ </pre>
