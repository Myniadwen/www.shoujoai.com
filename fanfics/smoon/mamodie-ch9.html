<h1>Mamorue Must Die! (part 9 of 35)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: This omake is dedicated to Mr. Toasty, who challenged me 
to write an omake using exactly one hundred words- no more, no less. The 
omake is in verse form. Enjoy.

------

The Senshi fought a youma of great mass,

It killed Mamoru before they could defeat it, stomping a mudhole in his 
ass.

......

&quot;Boo hoo.&quot; Usagi cried, &quot;Mamoru&#39;s dead,

Now who&#39;ll buy me sweets and pleasure me in bed?&quot;

......

&quot;Don&#39;t cry,&quot; Rei said, &quot;I&#39;ll buy you candy,

And as for bed, I know some tricks you&#39;ll find dandy.&quot;

......

&quot;Holy crap!&quot; Usagi shrieked, &quot;Rei&#39;s a lesbian!&quot;

She couldn&#39;t hide her shock (she&#39;s not that good a thesbian).

......

Never having thought of girls romantically before, she wasn&#39;t sure what 
to do,

But after one night with Rei, she forgot all about baka Mamoru!
