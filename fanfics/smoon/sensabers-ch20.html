<a href="../smoon/sensabers-ch19.html">Back to Part 19</a><pre>Catsy smiled charmingly at the blonde customer, the
purple haired young woman holding up a lacey two
piece. &quot;What do you think?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she frowned, &quot;it&#39;s not really my
style.&quot;

&quot;You were commenting that your boyfriend wasn&#39;t paying
you enough attention,&quot; Catsy reminded her, &quot;wearing
this, he&#39;s sure to notice you.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the young lady blushed, &quot;that&#39;s true.&quot;

A sale and one happy customer later and Catsy sighed,
leaning up against the till at the prominent lingerie
shop, the Silky Doll. All around her were frilly items
of one time or another, bras, panties and night gowns
all set up to draw the eye and inflame the
imagination.

&quot;What a day,&quot; Birdy sighed. Catsy&#39;s adopted sister
looked a little tired, her long blue hair tied back in
a braid as she walked over to grab her bottle of water
from the counter.

&quot;We did pretty good, tho,&quot; Catsy chuckled.

Both women jerked as they heard a woman yell, &quot;God
damned son of a bitch!&quot;

&quot;Rei?&quot; Birdy blinked.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Catsy agreed.

Upstairs, Rei Hino winced as she cradled her arm, the
cast covering it from wrist to elbow. &quot;Sorry,&quot; the
long black haired woman gritted her teeth as she said,
&quot;I&#39;m still getting used to this damn thing.&quot;

&quot;You should have told us you broke it in the tunnels,&quot;
Ami said fiercely as she helped fluff up a cushion for
her seat, &quot;I would have taken us straight to the
hospital, rather than coming back here first.&quot;

&quot;Ditching the hardsuits would have been tough,&quot; Rei
pointed out, glad she was dressed in just t-shirt and
jeans, &quot;besides, I didn&#39;t know I had broken it at
first. I though it was just bruised from that thing
throwing me around.&quot;

&quot;All right,&quot; Ami sighed as she down sat across from
Rei in her living room. &quot;How are things with your
band?&quot; she asked worriedly.

Rei shrugged a bit uncomfortably. &quot;They&#39;re going to
have to find a temporary lead singer until I heal up,&quot;
she said to her flatly, &quot;there&#39;s no way that I can
jump around stage and preform with this on me.&quot;

Ami winced, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She hesitated, &quot;Because it
happened on one of my jobs, I&#39;ll compensate you for
any lost wages...&quot;

&quot;Ami,&quot; Rei gave her a look, &quot;it isn&#39;t your fault.&quot;

&quot;I was responsible,&quot; Ami shook her head.

Rei rolled her eyes, sitting back with a sigh in the
comfortable chair. Changing the subject she said, &quot;I
think I know who you can put in my suit until the cast
comes off.&quot;

&quot;Of?&quot; Ami looked at her curiously.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Rei said, &quot;we&#39;re about the same height, and
from what I&#39;ve seen she&#39;s got the guts to handle the
missions we have.&quot;

Ami actually looked a bit startled, &quot;Are you serious?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I am,&quot; Rei agreed. She smiled slightly, &quot;And if
you and Setsuna are still interested in hiding her and
Michiru, what better place than in a suit of battle
armor?&quot;

&quot;Heh,&quot; Ami smiled, good point.

&quot;Miss Hino,&quot; the Mercury computer system asked
politely, &quot;would you like a cup of tea or some
coffee?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m fine, thank you,&quot; Rei answered, trying not to
look too hard at Ami. More and more she was developing
an awareness of the other woman, her slim body dressed
in suits that should have looked conservative but on
her were just sexy.

&#39;Damn it,&#39; Rei mused as Ami sipped her tea, &#39;no one
should look that good in a suit.&#39;

Putting her tea cup down Ami asked a bit nervously,
&quot;How are you managing at home?&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m all right. The cast gets in
the way a bit, but as long as I can open cans or run
the microwave, I&#39;ll keep myself fed.&quot;

Ami winced, all the while trying not to look at the
woman lounging so comfortably in her living room. Rei
had a feral sexiness that radiated from her, even with
the broken arm slowing her down, and to make it worse
the worn jeans looked painted on her skin. The ragged
t-shirt was battered enough to show Rei wasn&#39;t wearing
a bra, and Ami had to close her eyes to banish the
mental image of that sweet flesh.

&quot;I was wondering,&quot; Ami said a bit uncomfortably, a
light blush coloring her cheeks, &quot;if you&#39;d like to
stay here until you recover?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Rei blinked, wondering if Ami might have some
ulterior motive for making the offer. After a moment
she asked, &quot;Does that mean I&#39;d have to cook?&quot;

Ami smiled slightly, &quot;Actually, Mercury would be
handling most of that.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;But I could
certainly have her microwave something, just so you&#39;d
feel at home.&quot;

Rei awkwardly picked up a cushion from the chair with
her good left arm and pitched it at Ami, &quot;Gee,
thanks.&quot;

&quot;So you&#39;ll stay?&quot; Ami asked.

Rei shrugged, &quot;For a few days, anyway.&quot;

Later that evening across town, two young women walked
along the street, window shopping as they looked into
various stores. The taller girl moved with a dangerous
sort of grace, her green dress swirling around her as
her long brown ponytail swung in the breeze. Beside
her a pretty blonde smiled and held her arm, her red
dress clinging to her body sexily.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot; Minako asked, her blonde tresses gleaming
in the sun.

&quot;Yes?&quot; Makoto asked, her brown hair pushed back from
her face by a green headband.

Minako smirked, &quot;What are we going to do about Ami and
Rei?&quot;

&quot;Should we do anything?&quot; Makoto asked reasonably.

&quot;The sexual tension between them is getting
dangerous,&quot; Minako sighed, &quot;if the electricity in the
air keeps up, they&#39;ll blow a fuse.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re just a hopeless match maker,&quot; Makoto laughed.

&quot;Well, that too,&quot; MInako admitted. &quot;You don&#39;t think
they&#39;d make a good pair?&quot; she asked her lover
curiously.

&quot;If they didn&#39;t kill each other first,&quot; Makoto mused.
&quot;You have to admit, they&#39;re both very take charge kind
of women,&quot; she noted.

&quot;I suppose there is going to be some wrestling for
dominance,&quot; Minako conceded.

&quot;Some?&quot; Makoto teased as they stopped in front of a
clothing store.

Minako chuckled, &quot;All right, a lot.&quot;

Makoto looked at a green business suit thoughtfully as
she mused, &quot;You&#39;d think working around sexy clothes
all day would give Ami some ideas, but no...&quot;

&quot;Maybe she&#39;s just too used to them?&quot; Minako guessed.

&quot;Could be,&quot; Makoto said as they started off again. She
smiled, &quot;I heard something interesting from Catsy,
though.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako looked curious.

&quot;Apparently, Ami has offered to take care of Rei until
her broken arm has healed up,&quot; Makoto revealed.

&quot;Well, well,&quot; Minako grinned, &quot;maybe Ami is doing
something on her own!&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Makoto shook her head, &quot;I bet it&#39;s more guilt
over Rei being hurt.&quot; She smiled, &quot;But those two, in
her apartment alone...&quot;

&quot;That could certainly lead to something,&quot; Minako
agreed. She tapped a finger against her chin, &quot;And
with the right help, of course.&quot;

&quot;What are you plotting, m&#39;love?&quot; Makoto asked her as
they headed towards one of their favorite local cafes.

&quot;Just thinking of asking Mercury a favor,&quot; Minako
admitted, &quot;put a romantic movie on, some nice finger
food and let nature take it&#39;s course.&quot;

&quot;Some wine, too,&quot; Makoto noted as they were greeted by
the cafe&#39;s owner by name, &quot;to bring down their
inhibitions a bit.&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Minako agreed as they walked to
their favorite table.

Makoto held out Minako&#39;s chair then pushed it gently
in. &quot;We&#39;ll have to make sure Birdy and Catsy are on
board,&quot; she said as she took her seat, &quot;as well as
Setsuna, just in case.&quot;

&quot;Think she&#39;d help?&quot; Minako asked, looking over the
menu.

Makoto shrugged, &quot;Setsuna worries about Ami, from what
I&#39;ve seen, she&#39;d want her to be happy.&quot;</pre>
