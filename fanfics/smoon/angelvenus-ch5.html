<h1>Angel of Venus (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Nami winced and whimpered pitifully, flinching away from Ririko&#39;s hand.

&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; Ririko muttered. &quot;You can&#39;t be serious. It&#39;s just a bit 
of antiseptic. You can&#39;t honestly be afraid of that.&quot;

Nami curled up into a ball, mumbled under her breath. &quot;It hurts,&quot; she 
whined, cringing when Ririko made her way toward her again. The redhead 
growled, set the bandages and rubbing alcohol down.

&quot;Fine,&quot; she spat. &quot;Suffer. I hope you get gangrene. You shouldn&#39;t have 
let your guard down. I can&#39;t believe you let that little girl beat you 
up.&quot;

&quot;Those aren&#39;t cat scratches on your face, Riko, dear,&quot; Nami retorted.

Ririko clenched her fists to ease the urge to slaughter the other woman.

Royalty, mustn&#39;t kill her, she&#39;s a Queen, her subjects will have my 
head, she thought. Nami took the silence for defeat, and laughed 
mockingly, wincing slightly from pain.

&quot;Ahh, I knew you would give up. That&#39;s what I thought...eek!&quot; Ririko ran 
for her, bandages and alcohol in hand, pinned her down firmly. Her hair 
loosened from its bonds, and she grinned down at the flippant woman 
triumphantly.

&quot;Not so high and mighty now, huh?&quot; she whispered breathlessly. Now, 
basically straddling Nami, she moved to tend to her wounds.

&quot;I didn&#39;t know that you liked it so...kinky, Riko, dear,&quot; Nami purred. 
She grinned lecherously, ran her fingers across Ririko&#39;s face.

Ririko pushed a cotton swab dipped in alcohol down particularly hard on 
a wound.

The pain-filled howl that emitted from Nami took on an odd inhuman 
quality before it faded.

currents

The heart has its secret currents

Deep and without guide

To find out where they will lead

I take the plunge eyes wide

~Suikoden II, Currents


&quot;I have to concentrate, Usagi. Please.&quot;

&quot;But...you&#39;ve been holed up in here since yesterday. Come outside; the 
girls are worried about you too, you know.&quot;

&quot;I just...Nami and Ririko...&quot; Mitsuki opened her eyes finally, and Usagi 
was almost relieved to see that they were still blue. &quot;They are...very 
dangerous, you see.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot; Usagi sat down next to Mitsuki. &quot;What&#39;s so bad about them?&quot;

&quot;Ririko well...Ririko is so impulsive. She gets angry quickly, loses her 
temper, and well, results...they aren&#39;t very pretty. She&#39;s immensely 
skilled with her sword; it&#39;s like an extension of her body almost. She 
once told me that being without it would be without life. She&#39;s been 
training since she was old enough to walk.&quot;

&quot;Wow,&quot; Usagi whispered, baffled. &quot;And the other one?&quot;

&quot;Nami...&quot; Mitsuki looked down at her hands. &quot;Unlike you...Earth people, 
here, we are a world with very...unusual and unique races. Nami is the 
future ruler of her entire race, the Sirens. And they are beautiful 
people. As attuned to music as they are to the sea, their voices alone 
are enough to send most to their knees. But just because Nami is royalty 
doesn&#39;t mean she is defenseless. She&#39;s almost as well trained as her 
soldiers, and being royalty, the alien blood that runs through her veins 
is the strongest...when she transforms into her...other state, not much 
can stop her.&quot; Mitsuki looked thoughtful suddenly, her eyebrows furrowed 
in slight confusion. &quot;But something confused me yesterday afternoon.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;Her transformation was different.&quot;

&quot;How?&quot;

&quot;Well...like most royalty, Nami has to go through a coronation ceremony 
to become the Queen...she&#39;s only the princess now, you see. When she has 
her ceremony, her power is untapped, allowing her to transform fully. 
Usually...Nami is almost a hybrid, something in-between a true Siren and 
her normal form. But...&quot;

&quot;But?&quot;

Mitsuki stood up, walked toward the window.

&quot;But...she transformed fully yesterday. That&#39;s not possible. She hasn&#39;t 
had her ceremony; she&#39;s not even supposed to be old enough yet...she 
wasn&#39;t supposed to have it until years later...&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;She&#39;s confused. How can that be?&quot;

&quot;She isn&#39;t...what she thinks she is.&quot;

Kazuki looked bewildered for a moment, then quickly gained her 
composure, brushed silky, raven strands of hair from her face. 
&quot;Explain.&quot; She played with her hair, pushed it back into place, brushed 
invisible lint from her jacket. Smooth, controlled gestures.

A smile from the other. &quot;So composed, Kazuki.&quot;

&quot;Always.&quot; A rare grin; it lit up her face, barely noticeable creases 
added to the mature, exotic beauty of her face. &quot;Now please, stop being 
enigmatic.&quot;

&quot;I apologize. What I mean is...she thinks she&#39;s one thing, but she 
isn&#39;t. She&#39;s caught in this...limbo, of sorts.&quot;

&quot;Limbo?&quot;

&quot;Yes. It will...take a while for her to understand.&quot;

&quot;And when she does?&quot; Kazuki&#39;s voice had lowered to a whisper; she stared 
at the other woman in slight concern.

&quot;I don&#39;t know...but, I&#39;m sure results will not be good.&quot; The woman 
sighed, stood up. &quot;Keep an eye on things for me. I have...work.&quot;

&quot;Right. I&#39;m sure this must be a strain.&quot;

&quot;You...have no idea.&quot; She gazed over at the hologram-like device, 
watched Mitsuki be dragged around by the one they called Sailormoon, yet 
another bright light in the universe, perhaps, even the brightest.

&quot;I pray, Kazuki, that we will be able to save them. They deserve that 
much...even she does.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;See? I told you getting out would make you feel better.&quot; Usagi laughed, 
pulled Mitsuki along.

&quot;I guess you were right,&quot; Mitsuki agreed. &quot;It&#39;s a beautiful day today.&quot;

&quot;Do you have any hobbies?&quot; Usagi suddenly asked. &quot;Like anything you&#39;re 
good at? Besides you know, beating up bad guys.&quot;

Mitsuki looked surprised, scratched her head. &quot;Er...well...I can&#39;t 
really sing, or cook...unless it&#39;s in a can or package, I&#39;m pretty 
average at sports, not one or the other. And I think I&#39;m smart,&quot; Usagi 
giggled and Mitsuki continued, &quot;but I&#39;m not the smartest.&quot; She shrugged; 
Usagi frowned.

&quot;Well everyone is good at something.&quot;

Mitsuki looked up to the sky. Snowflakes fell, gathered in her hair. &quot;I 
never thought about what I&#39;m good at. But I&#39;m sure I&#39;m good at 
something, like you said.&quot;

&quot;Me too!&quot; Usagi chirped. &quot;What about your family? What are they like?&quot;

Mitsuki sighed. &quot;My father left a long time ago, and since then, my 
mother...&quot; she shook her head. &quot;My mother has been very strange since 
then.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Usagi said, lowering her head.

&quot;It&#39;s alright.&quot; Mitsuki smiled. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; She looked to 
the sky again. &quot;Usagi?&quot;

&quot;Hm?&quot;

&quot;Um...we&#39;re friends, right?&quot; She gave the blonde girl a searching look.

&quot;Yeah, of course! Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;Just...curious.&quot;

They continued their trek, and the clouds covered up the sun, making the 
day seem far gloomier.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;So, okay, she&#39;s a little strange. And her friends want to kill her.&quot; 
Minako chewed on her straw, put a finger to her chin in thought. &quot;But we 
can&#39;t just stamp &#39;Evil&#39; on her forehead. Give her a chance.&quot;

Rei frowned, stubborn and unmoving. &quot;But still. I just...she gives me an 
uneasy feeling.&quot;

&quot;Bad vibes?&quot; Makoto offered.

&quot;No...not quite...&quot; Rei frowned again, annoyed at her inability to form 
what she was feeling into words. It was unlike her not to know what to 
think of a person; her training as a Miko had attuned her to things that 
normal people would not be able to catch. But this frustrated her. There 
was a light, a soft peaceful glow within Mitsuki, but there was 
something else, something muddled and unknown. She had consulted the 
fire, but even it seemed to be confused. She wondered, briefly, if 
Setsuna was having the same problem.

&quot;It&#39;s just, I think...&quot; she didn&#39;t have time to finish that thought 
however, as Mitsuki and Usagi made their way into the arcade.

&quot;Hi you guys!&quot; Usagi said brightly. &quot;Look,&quot; she pulled Mitsuki in front 
of her and held her shoulders, &quot;I got her out.&quot; Mitsuki waved 
sheepishly, blushed.

&quot;Well, I&#39;m glad you could join us today Mitsuki,&quot; Ami said. Usagi 
grinned triumphantly, then gazed over at the booth the others were 
sitting. She pouted, and Rei shook her head, lowered her gaze to her 
drink. She felt a whine coming on.

&quot;You guys ordered without me?&quot; Mitsuki blinked, and the others groaned, 
used to this sort of behavior.

&quot;Remember Usagi?&quot; Ami began delicately. &quot;You&#39;re always late, so we 
decided to order before you.&quot;

&quot;But...but...I told you I was bringing Mitsuki, and she&#39;s never late.&quot;

&quot;Ahh, but,&quot; Makoto pointed out, &quot;Mitsuki was late this time too.&quot;

&quot;That is true,&quot; Minako said, grinning. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it Usagi; just 
sit down and order now.&quot;

Usagi ceased her pouting, seeing she was overruled in the situation. 
With the more pressing matter of her grumbling stomach on her mind, she 
found a space in the booth in-between Ami and Makoto. Mitsuki inwardly 
winced when she saw that the only spot left was one between Rei and 
Minako. She knew Rei didn&#39;t seem to like her very much, and 
Minako...well Minako had a very bad effect on her.

But the others were staring at her; if she didn&#39;t sit down soon, they 
would start to think something was wrong. Sighing softly to herself, she 
made her way to sit down.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Now this is rather interesting.&quot; Kazuki cut the apple in her hand; 
watched the display on screen. She chuckled.

&quot;I do wonder how that came about. My, she will be sorry she missed 
this.&quot; She leaned against her chair, played with the knife in her hand.

&quot;Oh, she will be so angry she didn&#39;t see...I do wish you could tape 
things on this.&quot; She smiled, continued to cut her apple, taking a bite 
of a slice now and then. &quot;Maybe I should have had popcorn for a 
snack...&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;I&#39;m not hungry,&quot; Mitsuki mumbled weakly, trying to keep her hands from 
shaking. Usagi gave her a concerned look.

&quot;Oh, but you didn&#39;t even eat breakfast this morning. It was really good 
too...&quot; she thought back on it and smiled blissfully. &quot;You should eat 
now.&quot;

&quot;No, no...that&#39;s alright Usagi. Besides, I don&#39;t want to spend your 
money.&quot; Apparently, that was the wrong thing to say.

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t be silly! It&#39;s just money, come on. Eat something.&quot; This last 
remark came out as an order; Mitsuki sighed and relented.

&quot;Fine.&quot; She wished she could go home and go to sleep. Minako laughed, 
shook her head.

&quot;I could have told you that there was no chance to win that argument.&quot; 
Mitsuki managed a smile without, she hoped, looking like an idiot.

&quot;Right!&quot; Usagi said triumphantly. &quot;Hey...Mitsuki.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You know, you read my aura, and Makoto&#39;s and Ami&#39;s, but not Rei&#39;s, or 
Minako&#39;s.&quot;

&quot;I...I um, I don&#39;t think I should.&quot; She lowered her head.

&quot;Oh, but you did it last time,&quot; Usagi pouted. &quot;Please?&quot;

&quot;Um...but I...alright.&quot; She hesitantly turned to Rei first, bit her lip. 
Rei quirked an eyebrow, violet eyes glittering in intrigue.

&quot;Didn&#39;t know you could read auras.&quot;

&quot;A friend taught me. Your aura is...very much like hers, actually.&quot;

&quot;And how is that?&quot;

&quot;In that...it&#39;s a swell of power, of untapped and boundless talent and 
skill. It is a raging maelstrom, yet somehow calmed with deep thought 
and maturity. It&#39;s like...fire, dangerous and untamed.&quot;

&quot;That sounds like Rei,&quot; Ami said thoughtfully.

Rei looked impressed. &quot;Um well...thank you.&quot; she coughed, turned back to 
her drink. &quot;Give Minako&#39;s a try.&quot;

&quot;Err, well, I don&#39;t think so.&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s face reddened; she looked away.

&quot;Why not?&quot; Rei all but challenged. &quot;Not up to it?&quot;

&quot;No...that&#39;s not it.&quot; Mitsuki had the feeling she wasn&#39;t going to win 
this argument either. &quot;I mean, I just...&quot; The others stared at her 
expectantly, she sighed. &quot;Okay.&quot;

Minako&#39;s smile seemed a bit strained when she asked, &quot;Do I have to do 
anything?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no...I can, um, you don&#39;t have to do anything.&quot; She closed her 
eyes, took a deep, shuddering breath. &quot;Alright.&quot;

&quot;Minako, your aura is...bright, but not in the way Usagi&#39;s is...it&#39;s 
something different. Unique.&quot;

&quot;And what else?&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;And it...a while ago, my comrades and I...we encountered an aura much 
like yours. It wasn&#39;t quite the same, but the boys felt it more than we 
did.&quot;

&quot;Um...exactly what did it do?&quot; Minako asked.

&quot;I believe...a proper term would be &#39;love slaves.&#39; It er, took us a 
while to get them back to normal. They couldn&#39;t be anywhere near the 
woman either without feeling the effects. But it&#39;s not bad,&quot; she quickly 
amended, when she saw the look on Minako&#39;s face, &quot;it&#39;s just...I told 
Usagi that she drew people to her because of the warmth and kindness of 
her aura...well, you draw people to you because of the love and beauty 
of yours. That&#39;s...what I mean,&quot; she finished lamely, tapping her 
fingers against the table.

Minako smiled, rested her hand on Mitsuki&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Thank you. That 
was very sweet.&quot;

&quot;Y-you&#39;re welcome,&quot; Mitsuki said, trying to get her heart rate back to 
normal.

&quot;So...&quot; Makoto said, sensing Mitsuki&#39;s discomfort. &quot;What&#39;s your aura 
like?&quot; Mitsuki glanced up, frowned in thought.

&quot;I can&#39;t really read my own. Ririko said it was a &#39;kaleidoscope of 
color,&#39; once. That it changed and everything, that it was hard to pin 
down. And that it was strong, and very bright. But...I&#39;m not sure. 
It&#39;s...hard for people to see what others see in them. Sometimes, I wish 
we could see ourselves through other people&#39;s eyes. That way we could 
improve. That way...we could see why people cared so much about us.&quot;

The others nodded solemnly.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Interesting point. &#39;I wish I could see what you see.&#39; I wish...&quot; the 
woman smiled at Kazuki. &quot;I&#39;m glad I made it in here in time to see 
that.&quot;

&quot;Wishes...hmph. Pipe dreams and lost fantasies. Familiar and comforting, 
nothing more.&quot;

&quot;Ahh, such pessimism. I do wish that you could at least crack a smile 
sometimes, Kazuki.&quot;

&quot;I do, it&#39;s just that people don&#39;t usually like my jokes.&quot;

Laughter from the other woman. &quot;Well, as long as you get enjoyment out 
of it, I suppose it can&#39;t be bad.&quot;

A grin. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised. So, how long do we have to wait?&quot;

&quot;Not much longer. But I am worried about this...odd effect the girl, the 
Venusian has on her. It might...it might grow to be something more. We 
don&#39;t want emotional casualties.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. And in matters like this, casualties cannot be 
prevented. Someone always gets hurt.&quot;

The woman nodded, stared off into space. &quot;I suppose you&#39;re right...&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Gracious, I&#39;m going to be seeing quotation marks in my sleep. That was a 
long chapter. Anyway, see you on the flip side, you jive turkeys. </pre>
