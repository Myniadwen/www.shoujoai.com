<h1>Fallen from Grace (part 7 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>&quot;Rei, do we have to go?&quot;

The miko sighed softly and looked at the annoyed girl standing at her 
bedroom door. Hotaru stared back with flashing eyes, her white pin 
striped blouse unbuttoned, revealing her black bra. Rei tried hard not 
to imagine running her hands along the girl&#39;s flat stomach and caressing 
her-

&#39;Oh my god, STOP RIGHT THERE! This is WHY I&#39;m in this mess!&#39;

Despite the mental torment, Rei managed to smile at her guest through 
her mirror.

&quot;Yes, Hotaru. I promised my friends.&quot;

The annoyed senshi walked in and sat down on Rei&#39;s bed, legs crossed 
neatly. A gulp came from the other woman. Damn, Hotaru looked so very 
enticing.

&quot;But they&#39;re your friends. Why do I have to go?&quot;

The miko shook her head at Hotaru&#39;s groan. This was more like the young 
girl she watched grow up.

&quot;Hotaru, it&#39;s ONE dinner. It&#39;s not going to kill you.&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

&quot;Look, you&#39;re my guest. I can&#39;t leave you home while I&#39;m out.&quot;

&quot;You can be nice and be a bad hostess.&quot;

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rei said sighing as she stood.

&quot;Fine. But I won&#39;t enjoy this!&quot;

The miko watched in amusement as Hotaru threw on the leather jacket she 
loaned her. First, she thought how perfect the girl looked in that 
outfit. Yes, they were going to classy restaurant which called for the 
slightly formal attire. But it made her shiver to see the girl dressed 
so professionally. Rei almost wanted Hotaru to graduate and get an 
office job already so she could see the younger girl like that every 
day. And the black pants clung to her long legs as she stood and walked 
out, hipping swinging rhythmically to the music inaudible to her 
unworthy ears...

Hotaru tapped her foot, arms crossed. What was taking the damn elevator 
so long? Just then, Rei walked out of her apartment and locked the door 
behind her. Hotaru stopped in her impatient tapping, eyes narrowing 
slightly to inspect the miko better. A dark red turtleneck hugged the 
woman&#39;s curves and the black leather pants looked painted on.

The soft ding of the elevator doors opening caused Hotaru to divert her 
attention. She quickly walked in, hoping Rei didn&#39;t see the lust in her 
eyes. The miko herself soon followed, both looking straight ahead.

&quot;Ru, look in the mirror.&quot;

&quot;What? Why- OH MY GOD! WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO TELL ME MY BLOUSE WAS 
COMPLETELY UNBUTTONED!&quot;

&quot;Hmm... maybe when we got to the restaurant.&quot;

Hotaru was still fuming by the time they arrived at the restaurant. Rei 
had to practically carry her in. Finally, as they waited for the 
hostess, the miko turned to her, a slight frown playing on her full 
lips.

&quot;Tomoe, behave or else I&#39;ll carry you all the way to the table and sit 
you down like the child you&#39;re behaving as.&quot;

Hotaru scoffed, but nonetheless straightened and followed the hostess 
that just arrived. Between spouts of her anger, she wondered why the 
restaurant looked so familiar.

&quot;A private room, as you requested, Hino-san.&quot;

The miko shoved her house guest into the room. Hotaru opened her mouth 
to yell at Rei when she noticed two very familiar people looking at her.

&quot;Suna-mama? Mina?&quot;

It was then Rei and the blonde sitting at the table burst into laughter. 
Even Setsuna was having trouble hiding her chuckle at her daughter&#39;s 
shocked expression.

&quot;Close your mouth,&quot; Rei teased softly as she guided the girl to the 
table. &quot;You&#39;re attracting flies.&quot;

Hotaru snapped out of her shock to glare at the miko as she was seated 
next to her guardian.

&quot;There are no flies in... where are we?&quot;

Setsuna arched a fine brow and looked at both Rei and Hotaru. Lavender 
eyes twinkled as the miko put her hand on the youngest woman&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Ru, we&#39;re at the Tower.&quot;

&quot;What!&quot;

The room was filled once again with laughter as Hotaru looked around. 
The Tower? She came here once a month, at least! It was Makoto&#39;s 
restaurant, after all.

&quot;How did you not notice?&quot; Minako croaked out between giggle fits.

&quot;Umm... I was mad at Rei.&quot;

&quot;What? Why?&quot;

Hotaru blushed under Minako and Setsuna&#39;s inquisitive gazes.

&quot;Well,&quot; Rei said, grinning like a crazy woman, &quot;it&#39;s not big deal. I 
didn&#39;t tell her she walked out of my apartment without buttoning her 
blouse. But I did tell her to look in the mirror in the elevator.&quot;

The blonde and her girlfriend were completely silent for about half a 
second. That is, before laughter rang loud and clear through the entire 
restaurant.

&quot;Oh god, Rei!&quot; Minako yelled as she clutched her stomach. &quot;That&#39;s 
great!&quot;

Hotaru glared at the three older women who were having a field day at 
her expense. It wasn&#39;t as effective as usual since she herself was 
blushing deeply. Setsuna placed her hand on the girl&#39;s shoulder, 
laughing along with the other two, though in a far more subdued manner.

&quot;Hotaru, at least you noticed before anyone saw you,&quot; the garnet-eyed 
woman comforted.

Violet eyes narrowed dangerously. Great. After becoming Minako&#39;s 
girlfriend, her guardian&#39;s teasing became more and more frequent.

&quot;Minako&#39;s done worse.&quot;

The blonde stopped laughing when she heard the low and secretive voice 
of her lover. Lavender and violet eyes turned to the leader of the 
senshi, twinkling with curiosity.

&quot;Do tell,&quot; Hotaru murmured softly, glad the spotlight was off of her.

&quot;Setsuna Meioh! Don&#39;t you dare!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; the oldest senshi began, ignoring the glares of her blonde 
girlfriend. &quot;We were at my apartment. I forced Minako to wake up early 
and she wasn&#39;t fully awake. I was in a hurry and went downstairs to wait 
for her. By the time I saw her when the elevator doors opened, I saw six 
shocked faces and the four men had nosebleeds.&quot;

Hotaru inched forward, hoping to erase her embarrassment. Minako had her 
face in her arms, cursing in every language possible. The miko, however, 
was anxious while she smiled in amusement outwardly. She still felt the 
stings of betrayal. But nothing was going to ruin tonight.

&quot;It turned out she had dressed quickly and left her left breast hanging 
out of her halter top.&quot;

The blonde groaned loudly. Rei and Hotaru blinked once. Twice.

&quot;WOW! How could you not notice?&quot; Hotaru asked incredulously.

&quot;I know you love attention, Mina-chan,&quot; Rei wheezed out between her 
laughter, &quot;But that&#39;s ridiculous!&quot;

The blonde woman smacked the miko sitting next to her. This made the two 
outer senshi laugh even harder. Minako smiled evilly and Rei felt her 
stomach drop at the sight. Oh... no...

&quot;Rei&#39;s done worse!&quot;

The whole room silenced, waiting for Minako&#39;s story. Meanwhile, lavender 
eyes looked around the room, trying desperately to remember the 
embarrassing things she&#39;s done. Oh god, there were too many, first of 
all. Second, she never could remember any of them!

&quot;Well, this happened when Rei and I were still together.&quot;

Hotaru glared at the leader of the inners when the miko stiffened 
besides her. When those two were together. Everyone thought they were 
the perfect couple, a match made in Heaven. The powerful leader of the 
Inner Senshi and one of the strongest fighters with a passion for 
protecting the princess that made her someone to be feared.

Both were extraordinarily beautiful: Minako in a classic Pop Idol kind 
of way, what with her golden locks and Rei, the mysterious, beautiful 
priestess whose sex appeal lay in her dark features and pale skin. 
Together, they were a team to be reckoned with, both on the battlefield 
and off. They were clearly close, the sexual energy bouncing off of 
them.

But, it was not meant to last.

&quot;We were headed for one of my concerts and we were... playing in the 
limo.&quot;

Currently, the youngest senshi was really trying her best not to jump 
the fighter she so respected. Playing. That was the politer and edited 
version of: &quot;fucking like jackrabbits in heat.&quot; Minako and Rei were the 
most sexually active couple, beaten by perhaps only Michiru and Haruka. 
It was like a slap in the face for Hotaru. She could never have that 
with Rei, whether relationship-wise or just plain sex kind of way. Not 
in a million years.

&quot;And when we were at the parking lot, Rei was getting a lot of looks. 
She realized a few seconds later she was only in her underwear and no 
pants on!&quot;

Hotaru giggled weakly, noticing the hurt and betrayed look in the miko&#39;s 
eyes. Minako gulped nervously. She had forgotten how touchy her old 
girlfriend could be.

For once, Setsuna found herself mad at her lover. It was insensitive to 
remind the miko of the former relationship they once had. Especially 
since Minako hooked up with her only weeks after the breakup.

&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Rei forced out as she stood, &quot;I need to use the restroom.&quot;

Although there was a bathroom in the private room Makoto built just for 
the senshi, Rei rushed out of the room. A sigh broke the silence as the 
blonde star looked at Setsuna for support. Instead, she found herself 
staring in the glaring eyes of one enraged Hotaru Tomoe.

The youngest senshi was barely containing her rage. Minako was the 
reason Rei did what she did: sleeping with different people each night 
and drinking. The miko wanted to feel loved, in any possible.

&quot;Aino-san,&quot; Hotaru whispered fiercely as she jumped to her feet, causing 
the leader of the Inner Senshi to shiver at the sound of the cold voice. 
&quot;Please be careful with your stories. If you and Setsuna-san would 
excuse me, I will be back.&quot;

With that, the college student slipped out. Minako leaned against 
Setsuna, feeling her lover&#39;s arms wrap quickly around her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. I didn&#39;t want to bring you into this.&quot;

Ever since Setsuna and the blonde announced their relationship, there 
would be hot and cold times with the oldest senshi&#39;s adoptive daughter. 
While Hotaru was happy her guardian found love, she obviously hated the 
fact that she broke another senshi&#39;s heart in the process. Especially 
one she felt was a close friend and someone she loved.

Yes, Minako and Setsuna knew long before anyone else that Hotaru did 
indeed love Rei. They probably knew before the youngest senshi herself 
knew.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Mina-chan.&quot;

&quot;I never meant to bring our relationship up,&quot; the blonde star whispered. 
&quot;I never meant to hurt her.&quot;

&quot;I know, I know.&quot;

Hotaru nodded greetings to the staff members that knew her while she 
searched for the fire senshi. Finally, after what seemed like hours, she 
stopped the hostess. The older woman bowed politely.

&quot;What can I do for you, Hotaru-san?&quot;

&quot;Aya-san, have you seen Rei?&quot;

The hostess thought for a second before nodding.

&quot;I saw her rushing to the bathroom. I was a bit worried about her.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Hotaru whispered, nodding before rushing away.

The bathroom. Geez, that was where the woman said she was going. But no. 
She just had to think Rei would be difficult and go somewhere else. 
Panic makes you really illogical.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

Hotaru was met with silence as she opened the door of the ladies&#39; room. 
Violet eyes scanned the area and finally settled on the prone form on 
the comfortable couch.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

A twitch of the shoulders was all the response she received. Hotaru was 
shocked at how much anger coursed through her veins. No matter how much 
she loved and respected both Minako and Setsuna, her love for Rei was 
dominant and taking control.

With a soft sigh, she sat down on the edge of the couch, her hands 
resting on the miko&#39;s shoulder. Again, there was no response, causing 
the usually calm girl to panic.

&quot;Rei-chan?&quot;

The miko suddenly sat up, brushing the tears from her cheeks as she 
threw a fake smile in the direction of her friend.

&quot;Sorry, Ru. I didn&#39;t hear you.&quot;

That was the biggest lie either of them had ever heard. Nevertheless, 
Rei begged to every deity in the world that Hotaru would let it slip. 
She did.

&quot;Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, course. Why wouldn&#39;t I be?&quot;

Neither of them said anything for a while.

&quot;Rei, Minako didn&#39;t mean anything.&quot;

&quot;I have no idea what you mean.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s eyes narrowed slightly. She wasn&#39;t going to let that one slip.

&quot;Stop lying.&quot;

Rei&#39;s only response was to look away.

&quot;Was I that obvious?&quot;

Hotaru smiled and instead of answering began running her fingers through 
the dark tresses of the hurting woman. The miko calmed at the touch, 
eyes closing slowly.

&quot;Well, bolting like a bat out of hell wasn&#39;t all that discrete.&quot;

Rei cracked a small smile at the sound of the shorter girl&#39;s soft 
giggle. Even when she felt like shit, her friend&#39;s laugh still struck 
her in a way nothing else did. A soft sigh slipped from her parted lips. 
It was time to stop pretending.

Violet eyes watched as Rei&#39;s mask fell and her body slumped, revealing 
her fatigue and emotional distress. The miko leaned towards her and 
Hotaru responded by wrapping her arms around the waist of her host. A 
warm feeling coursed through her frail looking body when a head topped 
with lavender silk was placed upon her shoulder, forehead pressed 
against her neck.

&quot;Rei,&quot; Hotaru sighed. If it weren&#39;t for the circumstances...

&quot;I loved her. I really loved her.&quot;

The girl only bit down on her lip, squeezing her eyes shut. God, there 
was nothing that could describe her feelings. Yes, she knew, but it 
didn&#39;t make this any easier. Damn the blonde. For having something she&#39;s 
dreamed of for so long but so carelessly threw away.

&quot;I promised myself that I would only love Usagi. Hell, I hid my love for 
her for so long that I became numb. I didn&#39;t think I could feel 
anymore.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t stay that. You loved all the senshi.&quot;

&quot;No. I really didn&#39;t know how to love anyone. Not until Minako came and 
told me she loved me.&quot;

What if it had been her instead? True, at the time Hotaru Tomoe 
possessed the body of a 5 year old. For once, she found herself cursing 
the chance given to her to start over. If she had stayed in her old 
body, she would have had a chance to help Rei. And to be with her. A 
slim chance, true, but a chance none the less. Then, maybe the couple of 
the moment would have been Rei and her, not Minako and Rei. Hotaru knew 
she&#39;d never hurt the miko the way the blonde did. Never.

&quot;But then she left me. And I find out later she was with Setsuna only 
days after.&quot;

A bitter laugh shook the body of the distressed woman. Hotaru did the 
only thing she could, she tightened her arms around the woman she loved 
to tell her she was there.

&quot;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love Setsuna like I love Makoto and Michiru and 
all the senshi! But Setsuna! Setsuna!&quot;

The student reached up and began to stroke the miko&#39;s hair again. Rei 
snuggled against her.

&quot;I can understand, I guess. Setsuna&#39;s very beautiful. She&#39;s got that 
whole mysterious aura about her. I&#39;m nothing compared to her.&quot;

Rei suddenly found herself pushed away from her human pillow. She barely 
registered that she missed the warmth before finding herself staring 
into violet eyes that burned with an unusual but beautiful fire. She was 
even more shocked when a dangerous growl came from the throat of the 
pale girl.

&quot;Don&#39;t ever say that. You hear me, Rei Hino? You are both very 
beautiful. In you own way, true, but beautiful nonetheless. Believe me, 
Minako&#39;s decision might have been based on a lot of things, but Setsuna 
being more beautiful than you was NOT and could not have been a factor.&quot;

Rei felt tears stinging her eyes again. God, she thought she&#39;d stopped 
crying permanently. She stopped years ago. Enough! Everything hit her 
like a tidal wave and the dam broke.

&quot;Then why! Why did she choose Setsuna! Was I just someone to entertain 
her while she worked on getting her? Wasn&#39;t I good enough?&quot;

The miko&#39;s arms wrapped tightly around Hotaru&#39;s waist and hurried her 
face in the girl&#39;s shirt. Violet eyes closed, trying to hold back her 
own tears as her arms wrapped around the sobbing woman, whose entire 
body shook.

&quot;No, don&#39;t ever think that.&quot;

Hotaru didn&#39;t even have to look up to know who the voice belonged to. 
The sight she saw when she did, however, was unexpected. Minako kept the 
bathroom door open with her hand while the other gripped the doorframe 
tightly. Tears welled up in the baby blue eyes that captivated millions 
as the blonde shook her head. The pain and self-hatred there was... 
heart breaking. Perhaps just as much so as the sobs coming from the 
woman in her arms.

Rei&#39;s cries had disappeared, though silent tears still ran down her 
cheeks. She had pulled away from her source of comfort, eyes trained on 
the sofa.

&quot;You were so much better than I deserved.&quot;

&quot;Is that why you left?&quot; The miko snapped back bitterly.

Minako bit her bottom lip. Oh god, this was happening all over again. 
This was hurting all over again.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then why! Why did you leave me after telling me you loved me? Was it a 
lie?&quot;

Hotaru strained to hear the last part, though she wished she hadn&#39;t. It 
was the question of a woman whose spirit had broken beyond the state of 
repair. It was the voice of a soul who had lost its way. And it killed 
her.

&quot;No!&quot; Minako screamed back, tears running down her cheek. She and Rei 
were looking at least other now, devastated lavender against tormented 
blue.

&quot;No... I did love you,&quot; the blonde said finally. &quot;None of what I said 
was a lie. None of what we had was a mistake. I regret nothing.&quot;

&quot;Then why?&quot;

Minako leaned against the door, too weak to stand on her own. Hotaru 
could only watch the scene unfold, feeling her heart being torn in two.

&quot;There were... too many things.&quot;

&quot;Name one.&quot;

The blonde tasted blood from biting her lip. She had no answer she could 
provide. The sight of Rei crying was almost enough to push her over the 
edge and tell her ex-lover everything. But no. Despite the circumstances 
she had to leave Rei and go to Setsuna, she now truly loved the Guardian 
of Time. She couldn&#39;t tell the miko. She couldn&#39;t hurt her girlfriend.

&quot;Rei... it&#39;s complicated...&quot;

The miko shook her head, sending raven locks everywhere and she laughed. 
The chilling and bitter sound echoed in the bathroom, causing goose 
bumps to appear on the skin of the other two senshi. The laugh was 
without mirth. It was the laugh of a person who&#39;s suffered too much to 
hold onto all of their sanity.

&quot;Oh god! This is fresh!&quot;

Rei felt the fearful gazes of her friends on her. But she couldn&#39;t stop 
laughing. Oh dear god! This was just too funny.

&quot;So, this is what it&#39;s like to be on the other end of those words.&quot;

&#39;She&#39;s finally snapped,&#39; Hotaru thought as she stared at the miko.

Laughter soon disappeared, leaving behind a chilling silence. Ruby lips 
smiled bitterly and purple met blue for only the second time that night.

&quot;So, even after all these years, that&#39;s still the best you can give me?&quot;

Minako opened her mouth, but quickly shut it. No matter how much it hurt 
Rei and her, she couldn&#39;t say anything. Strengthening her resolve, the 
blonde regained her composure.

&#39;Do it quickly,&#39; Minako thought as all emotions in her eyes disappeared. 
&#39;Do it before you can&#39;t.&#39;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she stated flatly as she turned to leave. As long as she 
didn&#39;t look at Rei...

&quot;I don&#39;t know what else to tell you.&quot;

The anguish Hotaru felt from Minako did nothing to quench the anger 
growing within her. Didn&#39;t she care at all the grief and pain she was 
causing Rei? Was she really that heartless?

That&#39;s when Rei spoke.

&quot;And to think I still love you.&quot;

The blonde froze and Hotaru could see her fa&ccedil;ade come crumbling down. 
Blue eyes welled with fresh tears as Minako&#39;s face twisted into an 
expression of regret. But it was gone as fast as it came. The door 
closed as the blonde walked out, head up high. It took a minute for 
everything to settle in Hotaru&#39;s mind.

&#39;She still loves Rei, too.&#39;

And that&#39;s the end of that chapter. How was it? I started it by trying 
to be funny. That soon went downhill when I realized exactly what kind 
of opportunity I had. I thought for a long time about who Rei and Hotaru 
would go out to dinner with. It was originally Michiru and Haruka, but I 
changed it last minute. But I am so very happy with the result.

I was listening to &quot;Hush, Hush, Hush&quot; by Paula Cole when I typed this 
up. It had NOTHING to do with this fic or even romance. But it was so 
sad that it seemed to fit pretty well, especially the conversation 
between Rei and Minako near the end.

Well, here&#39;s more on Minako and Rei&#39;s past relationship. This will 
probably be the biggest scene involving both the blonde and the miko 
when their former relationship is discussed. The other instances will 
mainly be Rei and Hotaru. Since I personally like Minako a lot and I 
also felt (I actually did and not because I like the blonde. Heck, I 
would&#39;ve made her a complete bitch if I liked that plot better) that 
this kind of mixed messages thing is better and more entertaining.

Well, next chapter! Hikari gives Hotaru a little advice/reality check 
while Rei gets to have some fun.
