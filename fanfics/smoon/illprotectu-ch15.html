<h1>I'll Protect You (part 15 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>Rei relaxed at her seat as she waits for Minako who prepared their 
midnight snacks. Rei looked at Minako for a minute, Minako felt the 
weight of Rei&#39;s gaze and she turned to look back at her lover

&quot;What?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;You didn&#39;t eat&quot; Rei commented

&quot;I was waiting for you. I want to eat together with you&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I made you wait...again&quot; Rei said as she rises up from her 
seat to go and hug her pop star lover. Minako leaned at her hug

&quot;I was really mad at you that time. I hate it when you are not at my 
sight&quot;

Rei stared blank, her thoughts were deep again

&quot;After the concert, you&#39;re leaving right?&quot; Rei said

Minako dropped the pair of fork and bread knife she was holding

&quot;...I...forgot about that part&quot; Minako whispered but Rei was able to 
hear

&quot;Yeah, me too. There are so many things happened between us yet we 
forget about this big thing&quot; Rei let go of hugging Minako and picked up 
the fork and bread knife that Minako had dropped. She took the pop 
star&#39;s hand and gently placed them on her hand

&quot;Rei-chan...Do you want me to stay here? Just say yes and I&#39;ll quit 
everythi-&quot;

&quot;No. What are you saying? You&#39;ve worked hard for it and I will never let 
you quit. Don&#39;t quit because of me, Minako. What about Wendy? Your 
staff? Your fans? They are counting on you, they supported you with all 
their heart. They needed you like I do&quot; Rei explained

&quot;But you&#39;re the one who needed me most. And I need you too&quot;

Rei smiled and kissed Minako&#39;s forehead

&quot;Do you want to come with me to Paris? Just say yes and I&#39;ll explain my 
side with big boss&quot; Minako continued, as the idea struck her mind

Rei looked intently at Minako&#39;s eyes

&quot;Well, I can&#39;t say that I&#39;ll quit because I&#39;m sure big boss will be 
upset. But I&#39;m one hundred percent sure that he&#39;ll understand us. I want 
to go with you&quot; Rei continued

&quot;Are you sure? You&#39;ve also worked hard for the job&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Bah, all I did was to clean big boss&#39; office endlessly. He&#39;s the one 
who always force me to quit this job because he said it was too 
dangerous for me&quot;

&quot;You cruel being! Big boss love you so much that&#39;s why he treats you 
that way...Think of it carefully Rei-chan for now. Let&#39;s eat first, I&#39;m 
starving and I know you are too&quot; Minako said as she lifts the tray full 
of food

&quot;I&#39;ll take this tray, go on and get the drinks&quot; Said Rei as she took the 
tray Minako was holding

Rei placed the tray filled with food on the small glass table at the 
living room and positioned the food. After that Rei sits back and waited 
again for Minako

&#39;&quot;Think of it carefully&quot;. That&#39;s also what the guy from the Sanctuary 
said before they left me at the abandoned place. How am I supposed to 
start telling everything to Minako? I know I cannot tell what exactly 
will happen in the future. Perhaps I can decide easily if I tell Minako 
about the death threat&#39; Rei thought

Minako sat on the floor opposite her lover at the glass table. Rei 
stared at the food with her eyes blinking

&quot;The food...Aren&#39;t these...too many?&quot; Rei asked, Minako stuck her tongue 
out

&quot;I haven&#39;t eaten dinner, and so do you&quot; Minako said

Rei blushed

&quot;You...skipped dinner for me? B-but I don&#39;t usually eat that much even 
if I&#39;m really hungry&quot; Rei reasoned

&quot;Whatever, Hino Rei!&quot; Said Minako as she stuffs a huge slice of marble 
bread in Rei&#39;s mouth

After few minutes the two had finished their food and cleaned up their 
mess because they were playfully stuffing food at each other&#39;s mouth, 
making the bits of food drop at the floor

&quot;You almost choked me to death!&quot; Rei pouted as she wipes her wet hands 
from washing the dishes to Minako&#39;s face instead of the hand towel

&quot;Oh yeah? You&#39;re the one who almost drowned me with the soda!&quot; Minako 
replied as they made their way to the living room to sit at the sofa

The two laughed at each other then it stopped. They were silent for 
about ten seconds when Rei broke the silence

&quot;Mina-chan, why is Ms. Wendy not here yet?&quot; Rei asked as she suddenly 
search for the pop star&#39;s manager

&quot;I suppose she was overjoyed with their talk in the other room and she 
got tired and lazy to get back here. She&#39;s probably asleep with Heather 
and the others&quot; Minako replied

Rei nodded then laid down her head at Minako&#39;s lap.

&#39;Well, I guess it&#39;s time&#39;

&quot;Mina-chan, have you ever received a death threat?&quot; Rei suddenly asked

Minako blinked and looked down at her lover, so much to start a 
conversation

&quot;Well...of course, I get lots of them back at England and other parts of 
Europe. Most of them are from stalkers, rival singers and from secret 
admirers. How about you? I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve received lots since you are a 
police&quot; Minako took the question back to her lover

&quot;Yeah, we get a lot of them too. But nothing seems to happen to me or to 
any of the people involved around me&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s also exactly what happens to me! None of those who send death 
threats made a move or tried to hurt me. But you know Rei-chan, when I 
first received a death threat, I was really, really scared! But then as 
time passes, I got sick of saying &#39;Oh, my God! Another death threat!&#39;. 
So here I am, still alive&quot; Minako dreamily said

&quot;Why did you ask that question to me anyway?&quot; Minako continued to talk

Rei shifted and looked directly a Minako&#39;s glittery blue eyes

&quot;The TNPH received a death threat for your concert&quot; Rei directly said

Minako didn&#39;t expect herself to be shocked but she was. Because the 
words came from Rei

&quot;So...That&#39;s the thing that was bothering you all along? Maybe that&#39;s 
from a stalker who followed me all the way from Europe. Then you don&#39;t 
have to worry about--&quot;

&quot;The letter was actually for me&quot; Rei cuts in

Minako couldn&#39;t control to gasp

&quot;W-what? The letter is for you, but it&#39;s about a death threat for me?&quot; 
Minako became confused but not an ounce of fear is bothering her yet. 
Rei nodded suddenly then took out the paper that she was reading earlier

&quot;Remember the paper I was holding earlier that you wanted to read? This 
is it, a message hidden in a riddle, the poem that kept my mind busy and 
flying ever since this morning. Big boss doesn&#39;t want you to worry so we 
hid it from you&quot;

&quot;But how come you got involved in this poem?&quot; Minako asked as she reads 
the paper Rei gave her

Rei couldn&#39;t tell Minako about her meeting with Sanctuary

&quot;I guess because of the issue that was featured at the newspaper last 
Tuesday&quot; Rei gave a clueless lie

&quot;Yeah, maybe that&#39;s it. This Sanctuary sure wants to make a huge 
practical joke on us&quot; Minako replied

&#39;So she doesn&#39;t have an idea that Sanctuary is a group of highly expert 
assassins. I guess that&#39;s a little relief&#39;

&quot;Come on Rei-chan, you don&#39;t have to be so serious about this. I&#39;ll 
lecture big boss about this, I think you guys are over reacting at this 
nonsense. You even stressed yourself badly because of this. And note 
you, it almost cost us our relationship. Where did you go earlier 
anyway?&quot;

Rei this time took a CD tucked from her pants

&quot;I took this from my apartment. I wanted to listen to a specific song in 
your album&quot; Rei said

&quot;Why? You could have asked me to sing it for you&quot;

&quot;I was solving the riddle in that paper. I think one of your songs has a 
hint to know the sender&#39;s intentions. And I was trying to hide it from 
you remember? That&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t ask you about it because I don&#39;t 
want you to be involved&quot; Rei explained

Minako made an &#39;Oh&#39; noise then sighed from boredom

&quot;Bah, why are we wasting our time to that? Let&#39;s do something to keep me 
awake Rei-chan&quot;

Rei thinks of something to do

&quot;I know, since I have my CD of yours here, I have something to ask&quot; Rei 
said

&quot;What is it?&quot;

&quot;Are you the one who wrote the song in &#39;Useless&#39;?&quot;

&quot;Yes, why did you ask?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Can you tell me what the song is about?&quot;
