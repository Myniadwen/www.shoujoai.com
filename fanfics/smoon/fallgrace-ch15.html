<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/fallgrace-ch14.html">Back to Part 14</a><pre>At 6:45, Hotaru Tomoe was sitting on the couch while flipping through a 
magazine, trying to keep herself calm.

&quot;Sorry, I didn&#39;t expect Kenji to call.&quot;

She looked up as Rei entered the living room. The college student 
shrugged, it wasn&#39;t the miko&#39;s fault that her coworker called, needing 
help. Thank god their plans hadn&#39;t been cancelled.

&quot;What did he need?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Rei replied, throwing her book bag over her shoulder.

&quot;What do you mean, &#39;you don&#39;t know?&#39;&quot;

The miko smiled at the confused expression on her friend&#39;s face. She was 
so cute sometimes.

&quot;I just don&#39;t. I told him I was sure he could handle whatever it was 
since I have a performance to go to with a lovely young lady.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s face darkened with an adorable blush. Cloud nine was where she 
was right now. Rei cancelled business to spend the evening with her! 
That said a lot.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll see.&quot;

Hotaru watched the city fly by in Rei&#39;s car. They were on the outskirts, 
the far outskirts. And it didn&#39;t seem like the miko planned on stopping 
anytime soon.

&quot;So, what did Kenji say when you told him to take care of it himself?&quot;

Rei turned her head to look at her passenger briefly before turning her 
attention back on the road. A cocky smirk played on her ruby lips, 
something that Hotaru thought made her look rather primal. In a good 
way.

&quot;He was speechless.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;To tell you why, I have to explain the beginning of HTP.&quot;

Hotaru settled in her seat. &quot;We have time.&quot;

&quot;As you may know, I was working at Heaven Industries even before I 
graduated from college. Utena was my co-worker, older, more experienced 
and almost finished with her Masters. A year later, the head of the 
merger department retired and Utena took over. I was about half way done 
with my Masters degree when Utena decided to open her own company, 
specializing in mergers. She asked me to go with her, and I did. We 
needed a lawyer and that&#39;s where Kenji came in. Twenty-three and fresh 
out of the university with a degree in law, he was a child prodigy. We 
hired him and then made him a partner a while later.&quot;

Hotaru nodded, looking at the trees rush by. &quot;So, he&#39;s not really used 
to handling things by himself?&quot;

&quot;Well, that and the fact that Utena&#39;s like the mother hen. She doesn&#39;t 
let him handle too much, afraid he&#39;ll make a mistake and blame himself.&quot;

&quot;But people learn from their mistakes.&quot;

&quot;Yes, true. You may not be able to tell, but Utena likes Kenji.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s mouth formed a little &quot;O&quot; at the news. Rei caught her &quot;fish out 
of water&quot; expression and laughed.

&quot;Shocking, isn&#39;t it? She denies it like crazy, though.&quot;

&quot;Does he like her?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s also very complicated.&quot;

At Hotaru&#39;s look, the miko sighed and shook her head. Damn curiosity.

&quot;Kenji used to have a crush on me.&quot;

Once again, fish out of water.

&quot;I&#39;m the &#39;charismatic&#39; front man... or woman, in this case. But Utena&#39;s 
really the brains. Kenji thought it was cool the way I handle things, 
business dealings and meetings. But after a while, he realized Utena&#39;s 
really the master. I&#39;m still the apprentice.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;So now, he&#39;s starting to like Utena,&quot;

&quot;Got ditched for brains?&quot;

Rei&#39;s foot slammed onto the breaks and Hotaru thanked the LORD there 
were no other cars behind them. Or else they&#39;d both be dead.

&quot;What!&quot;

Hotaru was plastered to her seat, her hand over her heart. Slowly, she 
looked over at the wide-eyed miko.

&quot;H-huh?&quot;

&quot;Hey! What do you mean, &#39;ditched for brains?&#39;&quot;

Hotaru blinked slowly, still trying to collect her thoughts. Rei shook 
her head and started driving again. Minutes later, the young writer 
snapped out of her shocked induced stupor.

&quot;Were you trying to get us killed?&quot;

&quot;Were you trying to give me a heart attack, which would&#39;ve ended in 
getting us killed?&quot;

&quot;Oh, you meant my comment?&quot;

The miko kept her attention on the road, though she didn&#39;t miss her 
friend&#39;s crimson blush.

&quot;Well, I just thought I&#39;d joke about it. If you don&#39;t want me to-&quot;

&quot;Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;-stop, I understand. I mean-&quot;

&quot;Hotaru Tomoe.&quot;

&quot;-I was completely out of line-&quot;

&quot;Tomoe!&quot;

Violet eyes fixed on the woman smiling at her, lavender orbs dancing 
with laughter.

&quot;Calm down and stop ranting.&quot;

The younger girl just stared at her and blinked. It seemed like the only 
thing the two of them did was blink. Geez, they really needed to have 
more facial expressions!

&quot;I don&#39;t mind if you crack jokes. It&#39;s refreshing, actually. It might 
take some getting used to, though.&quot;

Hotaru smiled and leaned toward the beautiful driver. She reached out 
and brushed a strand of raven silk behind the miko&#39;s ear. Their purples 
eyes met for the millionth time in less than a week. And for the 
millionth time, they felt the pull between them, the urge to kiss too 
strong for comfort. At least they weren&#39;t too close for comfort... more 
like exactly where they both wanted.

Meanwhile they were getting closer... inches, centimeters, millimeters 
and just a single atom apart...

Honk! Honk, honk, honk!

The two pulled apart and Rei stuck her arm out the window, signaling the 
driver behind them, though nothing that involved a certain finger (like 
she wanted). The two looked away, blushes darkening their cheeks. The 
rest of the ride was in silence.

Hotaru stepped out of the car, amazed by the sea of people in the large 
field. There was a temporary stage in the center of the grassy clearing, 
though many of the spots close to it were already filled.

&quot;We should have come earlier...&quot;

Rei tossed her black book bag at Hotaru and swung a large duffle over 
her shoulder. Confused but nonetheless curious, she followed the miko, 
making her way through the crowd.

&quot;Where are we going?&quot;

&quot;Just follow me.&quot;

Hotaru felt her annoyance grow at the less than enlightening answer. 
Rei&#39;s been giving her answers that weren&#39;t really answers all day!

Finally, after fifteen minutes of walking, Rei set her duffle on the 
ground.

&quot;What? Here?&quot;

They were at an almost empty spot, save one very sweet looking couple.

Hearing the annoyed tone of her friend&#39;s voice, Rei walked over and took 
Hotaru&#39;s face between her hands. Without a word and noting the look of 
surprise, she turned her friend&#39;s head to the left.

They were actually on a hill, quite high compared to the flat field 
below. The view of the stage was perfect, as if they were in a box seat 
at a theater.

&quot;Oh.&quot;

The miko released Hotaru&#39;s face and turned away. The writer however, 
brought her hands to her face, the skin where Rei had touched tingling.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;

Violet eyes blinked when Rei pulled out a large blanket from her book 
bag and placed it on the ground. She gestured for Hotaru to sit.

The college student had no problem obeying the command. Rei joined her, 
tilting her head slightly to look at her house guest.

&quot;Hungry?&quot;

It was at that moment Hotaru&#39;s stomach chose to growl. Flushed with 
embarrassment, the girl only nodded. Lavender eyes twinkled with 
amusement as the miko&#39;s red lips curved upwards in a grin, but she 
didn&#39;t laugh.

&quot;Good, I was afraid you weren&#39;t hungry.&quot;

Hotaru watched with interest as Rei unzipped the duffle and offered her 
a lunch box. Well, a rather large, triple Decker lunch box. The hungry 
woman took off the first lid to discover fresh sushi! The next was 
dumplings and the last fried shrimp!

&quot;Wow! Rei, this looks great!&quot;

The miko offered her another lunch box. Practically drooling, Hotaru 
quickly opened the lids. Fried rice, fish and rice balls!

&quot;Did you make all of this?&quot;

Rei smiled and winked. &quot;I asked Mako to make it. But if anyone asks, I 
did.&quot;

Hotaru rolled her eyes at her friend&#39;s antics but grinned nonetheless.

&quot;But Makoto is mad at us right?&quot;

&quot;At you maybe, but not me.&quot;

&quot;What! Why me?&quot;

The smile turned devious on the miko&#39;s lovely face and lavender eyes 
twinkled with mischief.

&quot;I sent Ami 100 red roses and said it was from Mako-chan. Ami loved it, 
a lot. So, Mako owes me!&quot;

&quot;What! You little sneak!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m guessing Mako will take it all out on you.&quot;

&quot;What! Hino!&quot;

The miko only smirked at the indignant expression on her friend&#39;s face. 
After a while of suffering Hotaru&#39;s glare and when the change of color 
on her cheeks became boring, Rei laughed.

&quot;Oh, Hotaru, I was kidding. I told Makoto they were from the both of us. 
So, she thinks she owes you too.&quot;

&quot;What about Ami? Isn&#39;t she still pissed at us?&quot;

&quot;Oh, I convinced Mako to throw in a line or two about how she didn&#39;t 
have enough money on her and borrowed most of it from us.&quot;

&quot;And how&#39;d you do that?&quot;

&quot;By telling her that I&#39;d tell Ami the truth.&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t Ami get mad at us?&quot;

&quot;Oh, no. You see, our favorite blue-haired doctor decided to... reward 
her girlfriend for the roses. And Makoto said nothing!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s perfect! I was really starting to run out of ideas on how to get 
on their good graces again.&quot;

Despite herself, Hotaru couldn&#39;t stop smiling. Rei leaned forward, eyes 
twinkling.

&quot;I know. That&#39;s part of my charm.&quot;

Once again, they were so close. Very close. Never too close.

Were they being mocked? To find themselves in this situation every time? 
Rei could feel her heart pounding, the blood rushing to her ears. She 
couldn&#39;t remember being this excited since she was with Minako.

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen!&quot;

Hotaru growled when the loud voice boomed over the speakers. Perfect, 
just god damn perfect! Was someone planning these things or something! 
That&#39;s the second time in half an hour! Forget it, she should just 
accept she&#39;ll never kiss Rei.

&quot;Welcome to the HTP charity concert. The profit from tonight will be 
going to the Children&#39;s Fund. Two of the leaders of the company, Rei 
Hino and Utena Takahashi, are here in this crowd somewhere! Please, sit 
back and enjoy the show!&quot;

A round of applause sounded as the announcer stepped off the stage. 
Hotaru, however, was staring at the miko besides her. Feeling the 
intense gaze. Rei busied herself by pulling out two pillows.

&quot;Make yourself comfortable,&quot; she said, handing one to her house guest.

&quot;You didn&#39;t tell me your company was responsible for this. And for 
charity.&quot;

Hotaru cursed herself slightly at her flat tone and watched Rei give a 
nonchalant shrug.

&quot;Yes, well, I guess I didn&#39;t.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes softened as Hotaru placed her hand over her own, smiling that 
beautiful smile of hers. The miko returned the favor and gazed at their 
touching hands.

&quot;Good job.&quot;

Lavender eyes focused on the dark orbs that seemed to shine with pride. 
A pale blush made its way onto the lovely face, the older woman blushing 
for the first time in a long time.

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

The concert was quickly coming to an end, four hours, 5 orchestras, 12 
singers and an operetta later.

Of course, there had been some very... interesting moments. Such as when 
an audience member had been chosen for the open mic portion of the 
concert. The young woman made her way onto the stage, confident in her 
abilities. So when she opened her mouth, no one expected what came 
across the speakers.

As she bellowed &quot;I Left My Heart in Texas,&quot; several members of the 
audience promptly fainted. Luckily, Hotaru and Rei were saved by a kind 
young woman enjoying the show with her girlfriend. Her out of place 
Trapt T-shirt aside, she was merciful enough to hand them two pairs of 
earmuffs, which prevented Hotaru and Rei from the falling to the same 
fate of others: screaming in agony.

Upon realizing that her siblings had fallen unconscious and her young 
sister was running around screaming, &quot;Hell! Hell!&quot; (Which the young 
singer swore, rather loudly over the microphone, that she had learned 
from their father), the young woman decided to spare those still awake 
(since they couldn&#39;t handle her god given gifts).

The teen returned to her seat. Well, she would&#39;ve if the next open 
microphone singer, a girl around 15, hadn&#39;t started belting out the 
first few lines of &quot;Come Down&quot; by Hilary Duff. The lack of talent aside, 
the lyrics sent the first singer into the corner of the stage, curled up 
and rocking back and forth while mumbling &quot;Not her, not my only 
weakness!&quot;

Rei and Hotaru blinked in confusion as they heard the young woman that 
had given them the earmuffs laugh (they had taken them off when the girl 
that left her heart in Texas stopped singing). When they asked what she 
was laughing at, the girl simply replied by mumbling about unplugging a 
TV and something about &quot;Twitch.&quot; The pair wisely decided not to speak to 
her again for the rest of the night.

&quot;It is my pleasure,&quot; the announcer exclaimed in that false chirper 
voice, &quot;to introduce now, Ms. Michiru Kaioh and Ms. Haruka Tenoh!&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s eyes widened as she sat up, sending the grapes on her stomach 
to the ground. Michiru and Haruka? They were performing here! Now!

One look at Rei&#39;s expression and she knew the older woman was as shocked 
as she was. But Rei was acting, right? Her company organized this.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Michiru said in her soft and soothing voice as the applause 
died down. &quot;We were asked to play tonight by one of our dear friends, 
Utena Takahashi.&quot;

&quot;Utena,&quot; Rei mumbled under her breath. So, Michiru and Haruka were the 
woman&#39;s special guests. She didn&#39;t bother wondering how they knew each 
other.

&quot;We were going to play a piece in her honor, but,&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice 
acquired an almost teasing drawl, &quot;decided last minute to change the 
song. This is dedicated, instead, to two of our closest friends.&quot;

Aqua and blue eyes turned to the hill the pair of dark-haired senshi 
were on. The miko now sat up as well, able to see the teasing smirk on 
the face of the blonde sitting behind the piano.

&quot;They are both here tonight, sharing a lovely picnic.&quot;

Murmurs rose from the crowd as everyone looked around, trying to find 
the friends Michiru spoke of. Fortunately, most brought picnic dinners 
with them and so they were safe.

&quot;Please enjoy.&quot;

Hotaru and Rei blushed when the music started. Due to the careful 
construction of the temporary stage, the soft melody reached their ears 
perfectly. As always, Michiru and Haruka were perfectly synchronized, 
weaving the smooth sound of the violin and the sooth notes of the piano 
into a piece of Heaven.

&quot;Dear lord, no.&quot;

The miko looked at the muttering girl besides her, confused at the 
embarrassed and shocked expression on the porcelain face. Then it hit 
her. Tchaikovsky&#39;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet,&quot; the so-called Love Theme.

Hotaru decided when the piece started that she would kill her guardians. 
&quot;Romeo and Juliet!&quot; And they said it was dedicated to them. Can they be 
any more obvious? She did not want Rei to know she loved her. If she 
hadn&#39;t accidentally leaked that out already. But the music?

Or were her guardians trying to tell her something? Yes, Romeo and 
Juliet is one of the most famous if not the most famous couple in 
history. But they were also star-crossed lovers. Were they trying to 
tell her that it&#39;d never work out between her and Rei?

Well, they didn&#39;t have to tell her that. She kind of got it figured out 
already.

Hotaru might be in love but she wasn&#39;t stupid. Rei sees her as a friend, 
maybe even a partner in bed, but never as a person to love. Yes, they&#39;ve 
had several opportunities to kiss. But they were always interrupted. It 
was always an &quot;in the moment&quot; kind of thing, the type of situation where 
you just feel the pull and you just have to kiss. It wasn&#39;t like either 
of them ever initiates is or anything. The magnetism between them was 
intense, but was it love?

Romeo and Juliet. Michiru and Haruka really do have a special sense of 
humor, don&#39;t they? Are they trying to tell her that she and Hotaru were 
madly in love with each other?

&#39;I know she loves me, but do I love her?&#39;

The question that hasn&#39;t stopped plaguing her for days. How could Hotaru 
possibly love her? Was the girl insane? No one could love her, she made 
sure of that. She was too wild, too unfaithful, too distant and too 
difficult to love. So what possibly made her friend love her?

&#39;Perhaps it&#39;s just her loneliness.&#39;

But Hotaru didn&#39;t have to be lonely. She was so... her. Pretty, nice 
body, smart, talented-

&#39;Oh god, Hino. You sound like a love struck teenager!&#39;

Well, she&#39;s been a love struck teenager for a long time. First Usagi and 
then Minako. That was what, 4 years of her life? She was the doting, 
caring and completely senseless admirer and girlfriend. She loved the 
two girls for different reasons but that didn&#39;t lessen what she felt for 
them. In essence, she loved them equally as much. Usagi was her first 
love and the one that was never meant to work. And Minako? The person 
that put her back together.

So did she have room for another?

The loud noise of applause and cheering snapped Rei back to reality. 
Everyone was on their feet, but the couple on stage remained calm, 
bowing with grace and poise. Lavender eyes looked over to find Hotaru in 
a dazed state.

&quot;Come on,&quot; Rei mumbled as she began putting everything away, &quot;let&#39;s go 
talk to them&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s violet eyes returned to their normal crystal clear state, a 
frown on her lips.

&quot;Yes, let&#39;s.&quot;

Hotaru could see her &quot;Papa&quot; leaning against the table backstage, talking 
to her &quot;Mama&quot; and Utena. It was the black-haired businesswoman that saw 
them first, smiling.

&quot;Rei, Hotaru.&quot;

The blonde pianist and aquamarine-eyed violinist turned, smiling. 
Utena&#39;s grin, however, faded when she saw Rei&#39;s dark eyes.

&quot;Haruka, Michiru,&quot; the miko greeted curtly. &quot;I see that you&#39;re Utena&#39;s 
special guests.&quot;

The two wisely remained silent, seeing the accusing gaze in their 
friend&#39;s eyes and the murderous gleam in their daughter&#39;s.

&quot;Pity,&quot; Rei drawled casually, &quot;that you vacation was cut short.&quot;

Haruka answered, seeming to hesitate for once. &quot;We decided to do this 
one show.&quot;

&quot;Rei-&quot; Utena started, surprised at her friend&#39;s behavior.

&quot;Funny,&quot; Hotaru growled suddenly, watching the fidgeting guardians, 
angry Rei and confused Utena through narrowed eyes, &quot;how you decide to 
do this concert in particular.&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Michiru said smiling, &quot;Utena asked us. We couldn&#39;t say no.&quot;

&quot;You did to me.&quot;

Haruka swallowed, seeing the gleam in Rei&#39;s eyes. &quot;We already said yes 
to Utena.&quot;

The miko&#39;s eyes narrowed while a frown appeared on her lips. &quot;I asked 
you first and you said no. After I told Utena my special guests couldn&#39;t 
make it, she asked you guys.&quot;

Even Michiru seemed to be at a lost for words at the statement. Utena 
jumped to her guests&#39; defense.

&quot;Rei, they were kind enough to perform. Isn&#39;t that enough?&quot;

The younger businesswoman backed off slightly at the warning tone of her 
friend and partner. She settled for a weary expression instead of an 
angry gaze.

&quot;I suppose family doesn&#39;t count much.&quot;

&quot;Rei.&quot;

The warning came from Hotaru this time, who had been studying her 
parents all this time. The miko calmed almost immediately and seemed to 
back down at the intense gaze of her house guest. The blonde smirked 
slightly, seeing how easily her daughter &quot;tamed&quot; their friend. It faded 
when the violet eyes were turned on her and her lover.

&quot;Is this the end of your vacation?&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart stopped. Did this mean Hotaru could be leaving?

&quot;Actually, we were planning to head for China.&quot;

Hotaru&#39;s expression remained the same at the new information. They were 
trying to set her up with Rei. And trying very hard.

&quot;Really? Where will you be going?&quot; Rei asked, relieved that Hotaru would 
not be leaving.

&quot;Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong-&quot;

&quot;Hawaii&quot; Hotaru interjected suddenly.

&quot;- Hawaii...&quot; Haruka replied without thinking.

The miko watched in amusement as the blonde squirmed under the gaze of 
her daughter and her lover.

&#39;Smooth, Haruka, smooth.&#39;

&quot;We should get going.&quot;

Haruka smiled nervously when Michiru announced their departure. The 
blonde hugged Hotaru, who hesitated a second before returning the 
embrace. Rei smiled as Michiru hugged her.

&quot;Take care.&quot;

The miko nodded to Michiru before Haruka came over for a hug. The 
embrace was even tighter than usual, and Rei could guess why.

&quot;Take care of Hotaru.&quot;

&quot;I will,&quot; Rei whispered as the two older women bid Utena goodbye.

The musicians headed for their car and drove off. Hotaru looked at the 
miko besides her with a somewhat timid smile.

&quot;Looks like you&#39;re stuck with me for a few more days.&quot;

Utena, meanwhile, looked on, half amused and half confused. Who cares! 
Rei and Hotaru were just too cute together.

&quot;Yeah, I guess I am. Pity...&quot;

A slim hand smacked the sighing woman, dark eyes mock-glaring. Rei only 
grinned.

&quot;Utena, need a lift?&quot;

The Japanese woman did, but she wasn&#39;t coming between those two! 
Hopefully they&#39;ll kiss or something.

&quot;No, thank you.&quot;

Lavender eyes softened when the businesswoman turned to the college 
student.

&quot;Let&#39;s go home.&quot;
