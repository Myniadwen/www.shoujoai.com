----------------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;All active Cupids of Omicron Group are to report to Cloud 59A 
immediately.&quot;
 
Cupid 79 Alpha&#39;s ringing voice stilled all conversation in the great 
dining hall, and Cupid 557 Omicron groaned.  Urakaze placed his fork on 
his plate as his companion laughed and took their dishes to the 
recycler.  &quot;Come on, Ura-kun!  We&#39;ve been Summoned.&quot;
 
&quot;Don&#39;t I have a say in this?  I don&#39;t want to go!  It can&#39;t be anything 
good, Asa-chan.  The last time the entire group was called was . . . I 
can&#39;t even remember; it&#39;s been so long.  I think it was that lecture on 
preventing the combination of powers between planets to keep the Solar 
System from falling to pieces again.  I haven&#39;t seen most of those 
Cupids since Rome, and there are some who won&#39;t come, some who retired 
like my mother.&quot;
 
Asakaze, Cupid 374 Omicron, pulled the younger Cupid to his feet as they 
headed for the edge of the great white cloud.  She was used to his 
complaining, having had to put up with it since he died and joined the 
Cupid Alliance so long ago and became her young apprentice.  &quot;Now, now, 
Ura-kun.  I know you miss some of your friends, especially since you 
spend all of your time with me.&quot;
 
&quot;Our Regions of jurisdiction overlap, and we both have Tokyo.  It makes 
sense that we are always together.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s not my point.  You need other friends besides me, and maybe you 
can use this Gathering as an excuse to make some.&quot;
 
Urakaze declined to reply as both Cupids opened their huge white 
feathered wings and soared off toward the appropriate cloud and the 
ordered gathering.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Cupid 79 Alpha was one of the founders of the Cupid Alliance, and easily 
the oldest and wisest Cupid still in the service.  Rumors made him the 
grandson of Aphrodite herself, but ever since the old gods returned to 
their planets for a much-needed vacation from the vagaries of the Human 
race, Aphrodite and Eros, the First Cupid, had not been seen.  79 Alpha 
refused to retire until peace ruled the world, and many of the younger 
Cupids wondered if that would ever happen.  He wings were bent with age, 
the feathers worn and frail, though he still flew from cloud to cloud.  
His once brown hair was whiter than the fluffiest cloud, and his smile, 
when given, lit the heavens.  It was rumored that he had been the one to 
bring Queen Serenity and her lover together in the Silver Millennium to 
conceive the young Princess, but he never addressed that rumor.  The 
younger Cupids wondered why he would not want to take credit for the 
most important pairing in the old Moon Kingdom, but Urakaze suspected 
that he had broken rules with those two hearts, rules he himself had 
helped write, and he didn&#39;t want the Cupids to lose respect for him.
 
Cupid 79 cleared his throat, and the meeting officially began.
 
&quot;Cupids of Omicron Group, this Gathering today is long overdue, and 
commendations are owed you, one of the least recognized and least 
outspoken Groups.  You never demand any recognition, so I must give it 
to you.  The Princess of the Moon and her entire court were reborn in 
Japan, your region, and I must say that you have worked wonders for 
them.  You understand that love is not just about two people, it is 
about the entire planet, and the power you feed them to fight their 
battles will one day bring about an age of peace and prosperity for 
Earth.  I am so very proud of you.&quot;  He took a moment to let the praise 
sink in, smiling as he continued.
 
&quot;Now, for the individual honors.  Cupids 226, 231, 256, and 263 have 
finished their time as Cupids and they are retiring with honors today.  
Please offer them your support as they move onto a new life.&quot;  The four 
Cupids, two men and two women, handed their white uniforms and 
Omicron-baby blue sashes to 79 Alpha, their bows and arrows already 
turned in.  They walked away, officially retired, and cheers followed 
them as they flew off to their retirement.
 
As the clapping ended, 79 Alpha stepped forward and held out his hands 
to Asakaze.  The blonde&#39;s purple eyes widened as she stood and joined 
the ancient Cupid, facing her fellows.  Urakaze sat up, paying attention 
at last.  &quot;As I mentioned before, your work with the Senshi is beyond 
compare, but the Cupid assigned to the Prince and Princess deserves 
special consideration.  Cupid 374, Asakaze, I want to congratulate you 
from the entire Cupid Alliance for your deft handling of the 
Usagi/Mamoru case.  As a reward, you are being given control of Cupid 
226&#39;s area north of Tokyo.&quot;
 
Asakaze&#39;s eyes widened, and she shook her head.  &quot;Really?&quot;
 
79 nodded, a grandfatherly smile on his wrinkled face.  &quot;Of course, 
child.  Did you not hear me correctly?&quot;
 
&quot;No, it&#39;s not that.  Sorry, I&#39;m having a bit of trouble focusing.  Why 
me?&quot;
 
&quot;Because you deserve it, silly girl.  Go back to your seat.&quot;
 
Cheers followed for the prestigious assignment, and Asakaze blushed as 
she resumed her seat.  Urakaze smiled at his partner as the rest of the 
regions covered by the retired Cupids were handed out, prizes to the 
Cupids who received them.  Urakaze was ready to sneak out when he heard 
his name called&#151;not his designation, his name.
 
&quot;Urakaze-kun?&quot;
 
The Cupid joined 79 Alpha, eyes wide.  Whatever did he do?
 
&quot;Urakaze-kun, I must admit that we were concerned about the choice to 
give you the Haruka/Michiru case, but after even this short period of 
time, our fears were proven ungrounded.  I extend to you the greatest 
honor that can be bestowed upon a Cupid; I give you an apprentice.&quot;
 
Urakaze&#39;s mouth fell open as a tall woman with brilliant red hair and 
sparkling green eyes appeared, wearing the white robes approved by the 
Cupid Alliance and the pale blue sash of Omicron Group, a tiny heart 
pierced by an arrow on the shoulder, indicating that she was just an 
apprentice.  &quot;Omicron Group, welcome Cupid Number 779.&quot;
 
&quot;Rikuriko,&quot; Urakaze breathed, tears in his eyes.  He didn&#39;t know that 
she had died.  He locked eyes with Cupid 79, and the old man nodded, his 
face sad.
 
&quot;You know my name?&quot;
 
Urakaze nodded as he bowed to the young woman.  &quot;I do.  I am honored to 
be your instructor, Rikuriko-san.  Although, I don&#39;t know how the 
Council knew about my work with Haruka and Michiru.  I have yet to file 
my report.&quot;
 
&quot;Only because you don&#39;t feel that you have done anything remarkable.  
Compared to other attempts and the many plans especially in the Silver 
Millennium, yours to push only slowly is remarkable.  We as Cupids 
sometimes forget that love can&#39;t always come in huge bursts.  Sometimes 
slower is better.&quot;  A strange light entered the old man&#39;s eyes, and 
Urakaze suddenly decided that he *had* to know what had happened in the 
Silver Millennium between the Queen of the Moon and her unidentified 
lover.  No one knew the identity of the late King of the Moon, and 
Urakaze decided that he would be the one to figure out.  For the moment, 
though, he had a more important job.
 
Urakaze smiled as Asakaze joined him and introduced herself to Rikuriko.  
Cupid 79 pulled 557 to one side and glanced at Rikuriko.  &quot;Yes, 
Urakaze-kun, she died.  I&#39;m so sorry.  You did so well with her, but she 
still never found her soulmate.&quot;
 
&quot;I knew she wouldn&#39;t.  Her soulmate&#39;s been dead since . . . 1807, I 
think, but I wanted her to find some sort of happiness while she lived.  
Her soulmate was never reborn, and I don&#39;t know why.&quot;
 
&quot;I thought it would be obvious, m&#39;boy.  Her soulmate is a Cupid, the 300 
or 400 series, I&#39;m sure, but I have no idea what group.  Now that she&#39;s 
here, the call should bring them together.&quot;

&quot;How did she die?&quot;
 
79 sighed and hung his head.  &quot;She was attacked and raped by a group of 
men not far from her girlfriend&#39;s home.  Her girlfriend came and tried 
to save her, but by the time she got to the hospital, she was gone.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s terrible.  I wish she had died a less painful death.  Will she 
remember?&quot;
 
79 laughed.  &quot;Of course not, foolish boy.  No Cupid ever does.  Go greet 
your apprentice, Urakaze-kun.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
~~*Flashback*~~
 
Haruka carried the unconscious aqua-haired beauty into her apartment, 
laying her on the couch as she closed the door and went to the bathroom 
to gather medical supplies.  She turned Michiru onto her stomach as she 
pulled the woman&#39;s shirt off and carefully began to clean the blood off 
the woman&#39;s smooth skin.  Michiru winced from the touch, and Haruka 
could feel the smaller woman&#39;s pain, though she wasn&#39;t sure how.  When 
the blood was cleaned away, Haruka carefully bandaged the gashes, 
including the shallower ones on the violinist&#39;s arm, noting that they 
seemed less painful and less swollen than they had been at the 
racetrack.
 
Michiru stirred while Haruka put the medicine away.  She opened her 
sapphire eyes, smiling when she realized that she was in a strange place 
and that it had to be Haruka&#39;s apartment.  It was fairly empty, sparse, 
lacking any essence of home.  She sat up, knowing that she was 
half-naked, and watched Haruka return to the living room, a shirt in her 
hand.  The blonde stopped, emerald eyes widening, trying desperately to 
look anywhere but at Michiru&#39;s breasts, excited by the cool air in the 
apartment.
 
&quot;Umm, I cleaned your wounds . . .&quot; Haruka murmured, swallowing two or 
three times before she was able to continue.  &quot;Here&#39;s a shirt.  You can 
wear it while I clean your shirt and try to fix it up.  Please put it 
on.&quot;
 
Michiru took the shirt, standing up as Haruka froze, eyes closed in a 
last attempt not to look at the siren standing before her.  &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong, Haruka-san?  You&#39;re a woman; have you never seen other women 
naked before?&quot;
 
&quot;Not on purpose,&quot; Haruka managed.  &quot;Please put the shirt on.&quot;
 
Michiru took Haruka&#39;s hand and placed in on her bare skin, smiling when 
the blonde tensed, her fingers automatically cupping around her round 
breast.  Haruka felt a tiny pinprick between her shoulder blades, and 
her eyes opened automatically.  She tried to look up at Michiru&#39;s face, 
really she did, but her eyes and hands had a mind of their own.  She 
found her hand sliding down Michiru&#39;s side, aiming for the waistband of 
her light blue skirt.  Cold reason and Haruka&#39;s control reasserted 
themselves before her fingers slid down any further, and she backed up 
so fast that she landed on the floor.
 
Michiru laughed as she slipped her arms into the white dress shirt, 
rolling up the long sleeves and fastening two buttons not far from the 
top, just enough to cover her breasts.  &quot;You really are uncomfortable 
around women.  Although, I&#39;ll bet that you&#39;d do fine if you&#39;d just try.&quot;
 
&quot;Let&#39;s just stop that train of thought right there.  I brought you here 
because I have no idea where you live and you were hurt.  I didn&#39;t mean 
to . . .&quot;
 
Michiru held out her hand and pulled Haruka to her feet.  &quot;It&#39;s okay, 
Haruka-san.  It was my fault.&quot;  She glanced at the henshin stick lying 
unnoticed on the small table beside the couch where Haruka had dropped 
it in her haste, and she smiled.  &quot;You&#39;ve decided to join my fight?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes.  But, I don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;
 
Michiru smiled as she took Haruka&#39;s hand and pulled her toward the door.  
&quot;Then let&#39;s go practice, shall we?&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;re going to be together for a long time, aren&#39;t we?&quot;
 
&quot;I hope so.&quot;  Haruka smiled at the sensuality evident in the aqua-haired 
woman&#39;s voice.
 
&quot;Fine, but do me a favor, Michiru-san.  If you plan on teasing me 
anymore, leave your shirt on.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll be able to control 
myself.&quot;
 
Michiru laughed as she flipped her hair over her shoulder and slipped 
her arm through Haruka&#39;s as the blonde called her henshin stick.  &quot;Fine, 
but you would be surprised what I can do fully clothed.&quot;
 
Haruka shivered.
 
Urakaze laughed as the pair disappeared through the door, Haruka 
reaching over lovingly to fasten the other buttons.  She told Michiru 
she didn&#39;t want her to get a chill, but Urakaze knew she wanted to make 
sure that none of the men outside dared to look at her woman.  The 
arrows were finally working.  His immediate duty concluded, Urakaze 
opened his wings and headed for a meal with his mother.
 
~~*End flashback*~~
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;Wow.  And they really controlled themselves that well?&quot;
 
&quot;Rikuriko-san, they controlled themselves until Tokyo.  And even now 
it&#39;s only just barely obvious that they&#39;re in love.  The Inner Senshi 
can see it, especially Usagi, but they are determined not to let their 
love distract them from their duty.  They are so stubborn!&quot;
 
&quot;Why did you never file a report on this case?&quot;
 
&quot;Because my job was to bring them together and they still refuse to 
admit that they love each other.&quot;
 
&quot;And Ura-kun always obeys the first unwritten rule of the Cupid 
Alliance,&quot; Asakaze added, eyes sparkling.  &quot;And I quote our now-famous 
Cupid 557: If at first you don&#39;t succeed, destroy all evidence proving 
that you tried.&quot;
 
&quot;Asa-chan!  I didn&#39;t destroy evidence, I just didn&#39;t tell anyone.&quot;
 
&quot;And you never would have.  Any small success in a difficult case should 
be reported, especially when you were given a couple outside your area 
of jurisdiction.&quot;
 
&quot;If they weren&#39;t already living in Tokyo, Urakaze-kun, how did you 
manage to get that wonderful assignment?&quot;
 
Urakaze laughed as he filled Rikuriko&#39;s cup and offered the pitcher to 
Asakaze, who had been too busy adding her own thoughts to the story to 
want anything.  &quot;I think they were hoping that my mother&#39;s genes would 
pass onto me.&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t see how Cupid 169 Alpha could be your mother.  Didn&#39;t she live 
in the Silver Millennium?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, but she kind of broke a few rules after the Silver Millennium 
ended and had the Council give her a human body on Earth long enough to 
raise a child with her soulmate, my father, who also happens to be 79 
Alpha.  Cupids can&#39;t have children up here, so we sometimes beg the 
Council to give our offspring a chance for a life of their own on Earth.  
I became a Cupid, like ninety percent of Cupid children, and I 
appreciate what they gave me.&quot;
 
&quot;Wow.  That must be why they gave you Haruka and Michiru.&quot;  Rikuriko 
smiled at Asakaze before returning her gaze and attention to Urakaze.  
&quot;So, what did you do next?&quot;</pre>
