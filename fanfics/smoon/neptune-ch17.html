<p>Goseki ran to his house, with Fujiko following close behind. The two  were starting to experiencing painful stomach cramps as they hurried  down the sidewalk, the young girl still crying after Zultan forced her  and Goseki to eat Professor Tomoe's daemon pods. When they got to the  door however, they found it locked.</p>
<p>A brief note explained that  they were with Goseki's older brother Hironari and his friend Haruka  down at the racetrack today to examine the racecar Haruka's sponsor  provided for her. The note also invited Goseki to come up when he got  out of school.</p>
<p>&quot;What do we do now?&quot; Fujiko wept.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't  know,&quot; Goseki groaned out as he clutched the sides of his abdomen. &quot;I'm  going to try to make it to the racetrack, though.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to  go try to make it to my house then,&quot; Fujiko whimpered. The two children  separated, with the little girl heading towards the more populated area  of the suburbs where her parents lived. She wiped the tears from her  eyes and ignored the adults asking if she was lost as she walked past a  small art gallery along the route.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>&quot;Is this good, Michiru-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm?&quot;  Michiru asked as she straightened out one of her paintings up on the  wall. After her painting had been exhibited on board Kan Shimozawa's  private yacht, a prominent art dealer had contacted her about a showing  at a small gallery he owned. After obtaining permission from Principal  Ichi, Michiru and her roommate were almost done with setup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I said, is this good?&quot; Takaiyo asked.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh,  yes. That's fine,&quot; Michiru responded with a wave of her hand. This was  her big break in the art world, but her mind wasn't on any of it. All  she could thing about was Haruka, and how the blonde rejected her with  the words &quot;stupid, stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've changed.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh?&quot; the artist asked as she looked over at Takaiyo.</p>
<p>&quot;You're not the same girl I knew when we first met at the beginning of the semester.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You've  become distant somehow. There's a coldness about you now Michiru-chan,  one that wasn't there before. I...&quot; Takaiyo stopped as she saw  Michiru's eyes widen suddenly, as if she'd seen a ghost. The artist  gasped and her whole body suddenly seemed to stiffen. &quot;Michiru-chan?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The sea is stormy.&quot;</p>
<p>Takaiyo looked at her funny. &quot;The sea is what?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru  didn't answer. Instead, she rushed past her schoolmate and out of the  gallery. Looking around at the men and women walking around her on the  sidewalk, she heard the waves pounding behind her and turned, following  the sound down and around the back of a restaurant. The waves roared  almost deafeningly as she came upon a small girl curled up into a fetal  position on the ground, crying in pain as she held her sides. Michiru  quickly looked around as the storm continued to grow, but could see no  youma or daemon nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;Help me,&quot; the girl cried as she saw  Michiru. She was about to say more, when suddenly a thick black cloud  surrounded her, the girl screaming as she transformed into a huge dark  blue tarantula, venom dripping from its razer sharp fangs.</p>
<p>Michiru  immediately pulled her henshin wand out. &quot;Neptune planet power, make  up!&quot; A second later, Sailor Neptune stood before the daemon, crouched  down in a fighting stance.</p>
<p>&quot;Help... me...&quot; a voice cried out into Michiru's consciousness as she saw an image of the child within the daemon.</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune's eyes widened. This wasn't simply another inanimate object  brought to life. This was a little girl who'd been turned into some  sort of monster. The thing lunged at her, hoping to take advantage of  the Senshi's momentary indecision. Neptune's quick reflexes allowed her  to get out of the way in time, but as she landed the daemon shot  webbing out, trapping her in place from the waist down.</p>
<p>Sailor  Neptune looked down at her lower torso now completely covered with  sticky webbing. She turned her attention quickly back to the tarantula  hissing at her as it began to bear its fangs. The Senshi realized that  if she didn't end this now, not only would she herself end up dead, but  that the youma would very probably go on to kill others as well.</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive  me,&quot; she whispered as she raised her arms up above her head, energy  flowing and swelling up within her as she did so. &quot;Deep Submerge!&quot;</p>
<p>The  blast hit the daemon full on, causing it to roar in pain before turning  back into a girl. As she fell unconscious to the ground, the pod rose  out of her body and crumbled to dust. The webbing disappeared and  Sailor Neptune quickly picked the girl up, thankful to find a pulse. As  the girl started to stir, the Senshi released her transformation and  was once more Michiru Kaioh.</p>
<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot; she asked gently.</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm,&quot; the girl muttered as she opened her eyes. &quot;I'm okay I guess.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Do you remember what happened?&quot;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. &quot;There was a bad lady with blue hair and a gold watch.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Blue hair,&quot; Michiru repeated as she narrowed her eyes, &quot;<em>Zultan</em>...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;She made us look at her watch, then eat these nasty cookies that made us sick.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Us?&quot; Michiru suddenly asked in alarm.</p>
<p>&quot;Me  and my friend Goseki,&quot; she answered, &quot;I was on my way to my parent's  house, and he was heading for the racetrack to find his brother  Hironari and Hironari's friend Haruka.&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru's heart began to  race in panic. &quot;Are you going to be alright?&quot; She asked as she put the  girl down. Fujiko nodded yes, and Michiru turned and rushed off.</p>
<p align="center">--</p>
<p>Haruka  finished looking over her sponsor's new car. She excused herself from  her new pit crew as well as her new sponsor in order to go into the  changing room in the back of one of the out of the way garages along  pit row. She chose that particular dressing room for both its privacy  and because it was one of the larger ones here at the racetrack. She  was wearing her new red racing uniform with her sponsor's name on it,  and she was carrying her helmet over her shoulder. As she entered the  garage though, she thought she saw someone crouched down in the back  corner of the garage. &quot;Is someone there?&quot;</p>
<p>Goseki turned to Haruka, his face contorted in pain. &quot;Help me.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What's  wrong?&quot; Haruka asked in alarm. She tossed her helmet aside as she knelt  down and put a hand on Goseki's shoulder. &quot;Are you alright?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Help  me...&quot; he pleaded once more. He then let out a scream as black smoke  surrounded him. In his place was a huge purplish-black creature that  almost looked like a gigantic worm, with large razor-sharp teeth  jutting out of its mouth. It reared up, slime glistening from its body.</p>
<p>Haruka stepped back in shock. &quot;You... Monster!&quot; she yelled as she quickly grabbed a tire iron and prepared to fight the thing.</p>
<p>&quot;Help  me...&quot; a voice called out weakly. Goseki's image shone briefly before  once more disappearing into the monster. Haruka froze, and the thing  attacked, knocking the blonde back and the tire iron out of her hands.  It reared back to strike again, ready for the kill. Haruka gritted her  teeth in preparation, when suddenly a shining gold light appeared  between the racer and the daemon. As Haruka watched in amazement, a  wand materialized within the light, floating between her and the youma.  She began to reach for it.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't do it!&quot; a voice called over.  Haruka pulled her hand back and the wand fell to the floor and rolled  away from her. &quot;Don't grab that.&quot; The racer turned around to see  Michiru standing in the doorway of the garage. She was leaning with her  back up against the entrance as she caught her breath after rushing  over to the race course.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you grab a hold of it,&quot; Michiru warned, &quot;You can never again return to mundane life.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, as Haruka watched in awe, she held her wand aloft and transformed once more into Sailor Neptune.</p>
<p>For a brief half-a-second, Haruka became once more aware of the scent of roses and the distant sound of music.</p>
<p>Then, the daemon roared, reminding Haruka that she was still in danger.</p>
<p>The  thing lunged at Neptune. The Senshi struck it, sending it hurtling into  the wall where it crashed into a shelving unit and sent tools flying  everywhere. The shelving unit landed hard on the daemon, sending a  cloud of dust up into the air as Sailor Neptune started to come towards  it once more.</p>
<p>Haruka had seen enough though. &quot;You can't&quot; she  shouted as she placed herself between Neptune and the Daemon, &quot;He was  human until just a few minutes ago!&quot; She clenched her fists as she met  the other girl's eyes. &quot;Are you alright doing this?&quot; she demanded,  &quot;This is murder!&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru narrowed her eyes. &quot;The silence is  approaching,&quot; she said, trying to make Haruka understand the stakes  that were involved. &quot;If I don't do this, there will be even more  victims.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka shook her head in disbelief. &quot;Are you saying that's why you don't care how you accomplish it?&quot;</p>
<p>Michiru took a deep breath. &quot;That's right,&quot; she said as she started once more to come forward, &quot;I don't care what means I use.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  couldn't believe what she was hearing. &quot;Are you really satisfied...&quot;  her voice died off as, with a loud crash, the youma reared up, sending  the shelving unit flying as it bore its teeth with a loud roar.</p>
<p>What  happened next seemed to happen in slow motion for Haruka. She turned  her head to look over her shoulder as the daemon sprang forward, ready  for the kill. There was no possibility of escape for the blonde, when  suddenly she felt a pair of arms wrap around her like a vice and almost  knock the wind out of her as she was pushed out of harms way to the  ground. &quot;Look out!&quot; Neptune yelled just before she cried out in pain.</p>
<p>Haruka  landed hard on her back, with Sailor Neptune on top of her. Neptune  could feel a sharp, agonizing pain in her back and along the bicep and  tricep of her left arm as she looked back at the monster. While Haruka  tried to catch her breath after the wind had been knocked out of her,  Neptune painfully forced herself up to her feet. The daemon roared and  prepared for it's next attack as the Senshi raised her arms above her  head.</p>
<p>&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot;</p>
<p>In a blinding flash of sea green  light, the daemon dissolved back into Goseki. The boy fell unconscious  to the floor as Sailor Neptune sank to her knees. She could feel the  back of her fuku beginning to become wet with her blood, the wounds in  her left upper arm sending long winding rivulets of scarlet down her  elbow and past her wrist, where they began to slowly drip from her  gloved hand to the garage floor. She started to collapse, but suddenly  felt Haruka's strong arms wrapped around her. Grimacing in pain, she  looked up into the blonde's teal eyes. &quot;Where's the monster?&quot; she asked  weakly.</p>
<p>&quot;He turned back into a human,&quot; Haruka answered, trying to  keep her voice steady as her outfit became stained with Neptune's  blood. &quot;He's all right.&quot;</p>
<p>Sailor Neptune turned with a look of  concern towards the young boy. &quot;I might have killed him,&quot; she said, her  voice trembling a bit as she watched the child's chest rise and fall  with each breath. &quot;No, next time I'm sure I'll kill.&quot; She briefly  glanced back up to Haruka before looking back over to the child. &quot;It's  not that I'm fine with it,&quot; she revealed, &quot;But I am a Senshi... Because  I chose to do this...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then why did you cover for me just now?&quot;  Haruka asked as she felt Neptune begin to shiver in her arms. She  grabbed the Senshi's left wrist and held it up, blood dripping from the  arm's wounds, &quot;If you hurt your hand, you won't be able to become a  violinist.&quot;</p>
<p>Neptune looked up at Haruka once more and managed a  smile. &quot;I didn't investigate you because you were the other Senshi,&quot;  she said weakly. If all she's wanted was information on her as a  Senshi, she could've very easily have gotten that from Pluto. &quot;It goes  back much further than when I realized you were the one, back when you  were just a voice in my dreams. I was watching you in your first auto  race from close by, when you made your time trials. I wanted to cruise  along the beach in your car... just once...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don't rely on  anyone at all,&quot; she continued, her smile widening a bit as she  continued, &quot;And you are always honest with your feelings.&quot;</p>
<p>Haruka  looked down at Sailor Neptune, her feelings in turmoil as she gazed at  the beautiful Senshi in her arms. As Neptune's breathing became a bit  more shallow and her blood began to pool in the folds of Haruka's  racing uniform, the blonde shook her head. &quot;I'm not honest at all,&quot; she  said bitterly as she found herself holding the Senshi closer, &quot;I keep  running away.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I know more about you than you do,&quot; Sailor  Neptune responded, her eyes starting to water up as Haruka began to  appear a bit out of focus, &quot;Because I've been watching you for the last  few months, always in the shadows. You were the one person I didn't  want to see walking the same path that I did, to know the pain and  hardships that came with being a Senshi. But... When I finally saw you  and realized you were the one... I was so happy...&quot; Sailor Neptune  grimaced in pain once more, closing her eyes tightly as tears began to  run down her cheeks. &quot;Gomen... I didn't mean to tell you all this...  Gomen...&quot; she whispered before her eyes fluttered a bit and she passed  out.</p>
<p>Haruka was speechless. She looked from Sailor Neptune to the  wand lying on the floor of the garage. Goseki began to moan. Haruka  realized that if she was going to do something, it would have to be  soon before the boy recovered. She picked up the unconscious Senshi and  quickly went over to the henshin wand. She held Neptune close as she  squatted down and picked the wand up. She put it in her pocket and  rushed into the dressing room in the back. The dressing room was  complete with a deluxe first-aid kit complete with bandages and  medicinals for the treatment of burn victims, as well as gauze and  medicine that promoted blood clotting in case of nasty crash-related  wounds. Haruka set Sailor Neptune down on one of the benches and  immediately began to undress. After retrieving her wand from her pocket  and carefully setting it down next to Neptune, she tossed her bloody  outfit into a nearby trash can and ran out into the garage.</p>
<p>Goseki  slowly opened his eyes and saw Haruka crouched down on the floor  cleaning something up with a shop rag in her bra and panties. The sight  immediately brought him to. &quot;Haruka?!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Tell you what,&quot; Haruka  said over her shoulder as she finished cleaning Neptune's blood off the  floor, &quot;You don't tell anyone about this, and I won't tell anyone about  that hentai your brother found underneath your mattress. Deal?&quot;</p>
<p>A  thousand and one questions arose in the boys mind, all of them were  silenced by the image of what his mom and dad would do if they found  out about the hentai. &quot;Deal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Good,&quot; Haruka said, &quot;Now go, and shut the garage door behind you.&quot;</p>
<p>As  Goseki shut the door behind him, Haruka ran back into the dressing  room. Unconscious, Sailor Neptune had de-transformed back into Michiru.  Haruka threw the rag she'd used to pick up the blood away, then threw a  nearby newspaper in to cover the evidence of what was in the trash can.  She then returned to Michiru. After making sure she was still  breathing, Haruka began to undress her in order to tend to her wounds.</p>

<p>End  Notes: I realize I deviated just a tad from the original dialogue this  time around, but hopefully that will be forgiven and won't take too  much away from enjoying the story.</p>
