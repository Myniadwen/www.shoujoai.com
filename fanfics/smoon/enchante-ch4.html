<h1>Enchante (part 4 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/enchante-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>I arrived at the Athletic Complex exceptionally early that morning. 
I&#146;m a light sleeper at the best of times and often find myself 
restless in the early hours. Mostly I get up and run, or ride my bike 
to clear my head when I&#146;m sleeping poorly. This morning I decided to 
get in a more formal workout. My fighting skills were, are, good, but 
it never hurts to get work on the basics.

I changed into my gi and headed for the multi-purpose room. It had 
weights, heavy bags and a makiwara board. I had decided to renew my 
acquaintance with a few old kata, then pound the board awhile. If 
nothing else, it would focus me, get my mind off of my uneasiness.

I was surprised to hear a thumping noise coming from the room as I 
approached. There was no doubt as to what the noise was - someone had 
gotten there before me and was whacking away at the makiwara. I 
groaned inwardly. I was in no mood to share my workout. Everytime 
another person saw me work out, I ended up being challenged to a 
fight. Actually, I was often challenged for no particular reason and 
it had gotten tired a long time ago. 

I stood outside the room, thinking hard about returning home, when the 
noise stopped. I could hear someone breathing hard. Surprisingly, it 
sounded like a woman. Intrigued as to what kind of woman would be up 
before the dawn working out here, alone, I slid the door open.

The woman looked up in some surprise as I entered. I stopped sharply 
as I recognized her.

&quot;Haruka-san!&quot; she stood up straight, her face surprised.

&quot;Mako-chan!&quot; I replied with a smile. &quot;Good morning! What brings you 
here so early?&quot;

She bowed politely and smiled tiredly. &quot;I haven&#146;t been sleeping well 
and I thought a workout might either energize me...&quot;

&quot;Or wear you out?&quot; I laughed. &quot;Exactly my reason, too. May I join 
you?&quot;

She nodded and gestured for me to join her on the tatami. She stepped 
back and watched while I warmed up, then ran through a few exercises. 
I spent another few minutes working up a sweat kicking and punching 
the makiwara. I could hear her pounding one of the heavy bags, but I 
couldn&#146;t spare any attention to watch her, bringing all of my intent 
to what I was doing.

At last I turned to her and bowed. &quot;Thank you for letting me share 
your workout.&quot; 

I headed towards the entrance when she spoke, rather tentatively. 
&quot;Haruka-san...&quot; she asked, &quot;May I humbly request a favor?&quot; I sighed a 
bit, not really wanting to get into this. I turned and faced her. 
Mako-chan was in a formal bow from a kneeling position, head touching 
the floor.

&quot;I&#146;m not sure that this is a good idea...&quot; I began, but her head 
snapped up.

&quot;Please?&quot; Something in her eyes made me pause. Her actions and words 
were the soul of humility, but in her eyes smoldered a fire. She 
wanted to pound me into the floor. I thought of how we had met, all 
the unresolved issues between us...I smiled at her and bowed in 
response.

We took our positions across the mat from each other, bowed once 
formally then began to circle. I had seen enough of her fighting to 
know that she had studied Karate, but I thought I had a few tricks to 
show her. I had watched her fight, of course. As Senshi we had, if 
only briefly, fought each other. That fight now lingered between us 
and the tension in the room grew. I knew she was thinking about how I 
had used her, about her crush on me and how I had betrayed it. I 
thought I saw a flicker of flame in those green eyes. I considered her 
strength, her fire and her resolve. This may have been the best thing, 
frankly - maybe the only way to resolve this.

She didn&#146;t immediately rush me, but she threw some punches and kicks, 
which I deliberately blocked a bit sluggishly, waiting until the last 
moment to deflect. 

After a few passes, Makoto pulled back, letting her arms drop to her 
sides. &quot;Don&#146;t patronize me, Haruka-san. If you don&#146;t want to fight, 
I&#146;ll understand.&quot; I pulled back a bit surprised. This delayed blocking 
tactic was one I had used for years - and every opponent I ever had 
had fallen for it. Except this one. She was better than I had given 
her credit for.

I nodded curtly and put my hands back up. Grimly, Makoto lifted her 
hands as well. We commenced.

She began to get what she though was a feel for me and increased the 
tempo. At last she launched a flurry of her best strikes at me and I 
saw my chance. I blocked every strike and managed a few blows of my 
own. Several landed and we broke apart, Makoto leaning heavily on her 
thighs. She was winded and very annoyed.

This time as she closed, Makoto moved a bit more carefully, but I 
could see that she was favoring one leg. I made a note to myself not 
to hurt the girl, but decided that she was ready for a fall. We 
grappled and I managed to take her legs out from underneath her. She 
fell heavily with me on top of her.

I lay there, letting her catch her wind and looked into her eyes. The 
fire wasn&#146;t gone, but had been dampened. I hate an opponent who 
defeats themselves, so I decided to use this respite to revive her. If 
I was going to win, it would be against the strong girl I knew, not 
this defeated creature.

&quot;What is it, Mako-chan? Can&#146;t decide which you want more?&quot; I reached 
for a choke hold and forced her to concentrate on my arms.

&quot;What?&quot; she hissed between breaths.

&quot;Which do you want more, to beat me or for me to kiss you?&quot; I let my 
eyes narrow, making my voice deliberately mocking. I could see the 
embers burst into flame for a second. &quot;Well?&quot; I moved my face within 
an inch of hers. I could see her eyes widen. I grabbed both lapels of 
her gi and began to apply a choke. She struggled, but did not break 
the lock I had. C&#146;mon, Mako-chan, I thought, fight me dammit!

I tried again. &quot;You don&#146;t want to win? You want to lay here and lose? 
Is that what you want? Or are you just giving up, so I&#146;ll take you?&quot;

She spoke, barely audible. I increased the lock and shook her. She 
turned her eyes full blast on me and I almost quailed. The look of 
painful honesty was almost too much to bear.

&quot;I don&#146;t know.&quot; she repeated to my insistence. &quot;I don&#146;t know what I 
want.&quot;

&quot;Yes you do, &quot; I cajoled. &quot;Look into yourself...&quot; and I waited one 
heartbeat. Because I knew that when she found her own strength, I was 
a goner. I knew she was strong, but this fight convinced me I had 
underestimated that strength. I could feel her muscles relax, then 
bunch up beneath me and in an instant, she was gone. Her leg lifted me 
in the air and I was flung over her head with amazing power. I hit the 
ground hard, but rolled and rose to my feet, turning to meet her even 
gaze. I could see the fire back in her eyes, hotter and more intense. 
*Now* I would get a fight.

She launched a series of blisteringly fast strikes at me, connecting 
several times. One punch hit me in the jaw and rocked my head back. I 
attacked her, but couldn&#146;t come to grips, finding her supple as a 
snake. I did manage one throw, but she sprang up immediately, as if 
she had never even touched the ground.

We sparred for a few more moments, no quarter given, or asked, and I 
found my respect for this girl renewed and increased with every 
moment. Once again I closed with her and once again I began to take 
her to the ground. But this time, she slipped my grip and with a jerk 
grabbed hold of my gi. 

With a tremendous display of raw power, and a triumphant grunt, Makoto 
actually lifted me off of the ground and above her head. I lost all 
bearing as she lifted me up, then brought her arms crashing towards 
the ground. I went as limp as I could, ready for the blow of the mat 
against my body. 

But I never hit the ground. Halfway to the ground, Makoto stopped me 
in mid air, released my limp, useless legs and held me - HELD me, me, 
the tallest person I know and one of the strongest, held me face to 
face with her. I could feel my legs moving ineffectually in the air. 
My body was slack and my root completely gone. She held me there, 
looking into my eyes and she smiled, wolfishly. 

For the first and only time in my life I understood what it means to 
feel swept off of your feet. 

And then she kissed me. Hard. The fire in her eyes never left, but 
raged harder, more intensely and I answered it. We fell to the ground 
together, pulling at each other&#146;s clothes, lust and need mingling with 
the flame of combat. I knew battlelust, I&#146;d felt it before, but never 
so intensely. I ripped her shirt, pulling it over her head, and mine 
was off before I knew what had happened. I could feel her teeth on my 
throat, my shoulders and my ears. I knew I&#146;d be covered in marks by 
the time she was done with me. I moaned as she raked her teeth across 
my shoulder, and her nails dug into my back. I looked up into her 
eyes, as she straddled me, pinning me down with her knees and arms.

What power this girl was capable of, and what control. As she devoured 
me, I let my eyes close and be carried away by her. Of course, it was 
about control. I decided to give Makoto exactly what she wanted, and 
abandoned myself to her, to her commands. She demanded my 
subservience, and I freely gave it. I begged her to fuck me and she 
was able to deny me. I could her hear laugh and see the recognition of 
my ploy in her eyes. I asked to serve her, and was granted permission. 
She let me up and I immediately began to caress her lovingly. I ran my 
hand between her legs and rolled her clit between my fingers. I sucked 
on one breast and played with her other one. When Makoto&#146;s body spoke 
of a deeper need, I entered her and buried my face between her legs. 
She came almost silently, her body rigid, covered in a light sheen of 
sweat. When she relaxed, I looked over her - admiring the hard 
muscles, the strong legs, the firm buttocks. She really was a 
beautiful girl.

Her breathing became more regular and I kissed her, not taking my hand 
out of her. I had done what she wanted, now it was time to get what I 
wanted. Slowly, I began to move within her, finding corners and 
filling them, gently massaging sensitive areas. I could feel her heart 
beating harder, as I increased my speed. From deep within her body I 
could feel the spasms begin. With a gasp, she thrust her hand between 
her legs and played with herself, until her second orgasm came 
screeching out of her, muffled as Makoto bit into my shoulder to quiet 
herself. When her body finished shaking, she released my shoulder and 
fell backwards limply. I soothed her and covered her up in her gi top. 
She let her eyes close for a moment, then struggled to sit up. She 
looked around, a bit dazed.

&quot;We probably shouldn&#146;t stay here like this.&quot; She giggled a bit 
giddily, as she pulled her clothes back on. I did the same and we both 
stood up. Makoto looked at me through narrowed eyes. &quot;Don&#146;t I owe you 
or something?&quot;

I demurred. &quot;You don&#146;t owe me anything. Let&#146;s consider it a draw.&quot; 

She looked at me strangely. &quot;I wasn&#146;t talking about the kumite.&quot; 

I smiled. &quot;I know.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

When we left the all-purpose room a few other people had entered the 
club, but the women&#146;s locker room was empty. We stripped, showered and 
went back to our lockers to change. Makoto was very quiet, but seemed 
happy enough. I didn&#146;t try to engage her in meaningless chatter. 

I turned away from her, to get my clothes, when I felt her grab one 
arm, spin me around and slam me firmly up against the locker.

&quot;It&#39;s not over until I say it is.&quot; She said teasingly. Her hand 
slipped between my legs and began to stroke me. Already wet from our 
previous encounter, she found me ready for her. She watched my face as 
I leaned my head back on the locker. I could feel her fingers inside 
me. Apparently she learned her lessons well. With a surprised grunt, I 
felt her moving around, hitting all my sensitive spots. 

I smiled through half-open eyes. &quot;Can I come for you?&quot; I whispered and 
felt her shudder. She nodded and I reached down to touch myself. My 
orgasm was stronger for having been delayed and it went on for a very 
long time. When I caught my breath, I looked down and saw Makoto 
leaning her head against me, panting. She looked up and smiled 
brightly. I couldn&#146;t help myself. I leaned down and kissed her and she 
responded so sweetly, I could feel my throat close with emotion. I 
stroked her hair, and held her to me.

We stood like that for a long time. Finally she kissed me once more 
and stood up. I could hear noises coming from beyond the entrance - 
people were coming into the room. We separated, and dressed silently. 
Together we left the Athletic Center. 

Outside the entrance I paused and offered her a ride home.

Makoto turned to me and bowed. &quot;No thank you.&quot; she said happily, &quot;I&#146;d 
prefer to walk. But thank you for the match. Now, we can consider it a 
draw.&quot; And she stepped into the street, waved over her shoulder at me 
and walked briskly away.
