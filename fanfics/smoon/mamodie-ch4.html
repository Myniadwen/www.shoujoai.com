<a href="../smoon/mamodie-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Author&#39;s Note: First off, I want to thank everyone whose been following 
this series, and especially those of you out there volunteering ideas 
(especially Alara Moonrunner, who suggested killing him off by his 
getting in the way of the Senshi attacks and whom I forgot to 
acknowledge in chapter two).

The following episode is based on a nominee for the Darwin Awards a few 
years back. Enjoy.

---Episode Four: Splat!---

Tuxedo Kamen received the distress call and hurried over to the 
dilapidated old hotel as fast as he could. When he got there, he found 
the Sailor Senshi battling a huge five hundred pound youma up on the 
roof. The Senshi had tried all their attacks, but nothing had worked. 
The young women were cowering near the end of the roof, and Tuxedo Kamen 
knew he didn&#39;t have time to get up there to save them.

He pulled his rose out, knowing his aim would have to be perfect.

&quot;Sailor Moon, duck!&quot; he shouted as he flung the fragrant projectile. 
Usagi moved out of the way just in time as the rose imbedded itself into 
the youma&#39;s heart like a dagger.

&quot;Tuxedo Kamen, you saved us!&quot; Sailor Moon cheered.

The thing clutched its chest as its eyes rolled back.

&quot;Don&#39;t mention it.&quot; Tuxedo Kamen said with a smile, &quot;It was nothing, 
really.&quot;

The youma then fell dead from the five story building&#39;s roof.

&quot;Mamo-chan!&quot; Sailor Venus screamed, &quot;Look out!&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Tuxedo Kamen asked, &quot;Wha...&quot;

Unfortunately for all involved, the dead body of the five hundred pound 
youma landed directly on top of Tuxedo Kamen. The impact cracked the 
sidewalk the hero was standing on and squashed his body like a grape.

In the stunned silence that followed, Sailor Moon began to weep, her 
heart breaking as she saw her love sprawled out under the beast, his 
tongue sticking out in an almost comical way. She&#39;d never felt pain like 
this before, and didn&#39;t know if it was possible for her to ever feel 
happy again.

Just then, a pair of arms wrapped around her from behind, pulling her 
into a hug.

&quot;Usagi.&quot; Rei whispered, &quot;I... I&#39;m so sorry.&quot;

Makoto leaned over the side of the dilapidated building when she thought 
she saw something. It almost looked like Tuxedo Kamen was ever so 
slightly stirring under the youma&#39;s body. &quot;Hey guys!&quot; she shouted 
excitedly, &quot;I...&quot; before she could finish her sentence, a loose brick on 
the balcony she was leaning on came free and fell straight down, landing 
on Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s face. &quot;Uh... Never mind.&quot; she said sheepishly.

&quot;He&#39;s dead.&quot; Usagi sobbed, &quot;The only love I ever had, I...&quot;

&quot;Not your only love.&quot; Rei said, her voice thick with emotions.

Usagi turned around in her friends arms and looked at her funny, &quot;Rei?&quot; 
she asked, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;I... I love you, Usagi. I have for a while now. I know how sad you are, 
and how heartbroken, but if... If you gave me a chance Usagi, I could 
make you so happy. And I know that if Mamo-chan were around, he&#39;d... 
That&#39;s funny, how&#39;d that brick get there? Anyways, if he were around he 
wouldn&#39;t want you to be sad and depressed; he&#39;d want you to be happy 
too.&quot;

Usagi&#39;s beautiful blue eyes widened as she reached over and stroked 
Rei&#39;s cheek, &quot;Rei-chan...&quot; she whispered breathlessly.

Rei smiled, &quot;Come.&quot; she said, &quot;We&#39;ll go to my place.&quot;

And so, as the refuse truck came by to dispose of the youma and Mamoru, 
Rei and Usagi joined hands, intent on starting their new life together.
