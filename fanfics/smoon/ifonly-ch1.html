<h1>If Only (part 1 of 3)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/meikosama.html">Azfixiation</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;So, you wanna race me? I bet I can beat you,&quot; Minako teased her best
friend wanting someone to race against. They were at Minako&#39;s favorite
hangout, besides the mall, and Minako didn&#39;t have anyone to play video
games with.

&quot;You know I suck at games. Besides, I already know I&#39;ll lose. The only
one who can beat you is Haruka-san.&quot; Makoto sat down at one of the
booths exhausted from the lack of sleep she got the previous night.

&quot;I bet I could beat her. I&#39;ve improved you know,&quot; Minako stood next to
where Makoto was sitting. As she noticed the grin on Makoto&#39;s face she
felt as if something were wrong. &quot;Why do you look so entertained all of
the sudden?&quot;

Makoto just kept grinning when suddenly a very familiar voice spoke up
behind Minako. &quot;You really think you can beat me?&quot;

When Minako heard Haruka&#39;s voice she practically jumped into
Makoto&#39;s lap. &quot;Haruka-san..You scared me.&quot;

&quot;Well what are you waiting for? You think you can beat me so let&#39;s go.&quot;
Haruka walked off and sat down in one of the seats of the F1 racing
game.

Minako could only gulp, knowing full well that Haruka would beat her.
She slowly walked towards the game and sat down. Once the two began
the race, Haruka let Minako take the lead like always. Makoto and
Michiru stood behind the two, watching in anticipation. Just as Minako
saw the finish line she realized she was still in first place. All of the
sudden Haruka flew by her winning the game.

&quot;It&#39;s not fair!&quot; Minako slammed her fists against the steering wheel in
frustration.

&quot;Oh come on, it&#39;s not that bad.&quot; Makoto said trying to comfort her
friend. Minako finally stood up and facing Makoto gave her a very mean
look. Makoto took a few steps back, knowing she could very well be in
trouble.

&quot;You owe me so big for not telling me Haruka was behind me that
whole time.&quot;

&quot;I couldn&#39;t help it!&quot; Makoto tried to think of ways to defend herself.

&quot;Well now you gotta make it up to me.&quot; Minako smiled innocently and
sat down at a booth. Haruka and Michiru left saying they were out
shopping and decided to stop in and say hi since they saw the two from
the window. Makoto after saying farewell to the couple sat down across
from Minako at the table.

&quot;So what do I have to do to make it up to you?&quot;

&#39;Well you could ask me out, be my girlfriend, tell me you love me...&#39; A
million ideas ran through Minako&#39;s head. She&#39;d known for quite some
time how she felt towards her best friend and finally decided that it was
time to do something about it. She just hoped Makoto would feel the
same. &quot;How about you make me dinner at your place tonight?&quot;

The only thing Makoto could think after hearing that was &#147;oh no.&#148; She
knew that if Minako was at her house she&#146;d most likely spend the night
again. For the third night in a row. Not that Makoto really minded, but
the lack of sleep was starting to get to her. Since she lived by herself
she had only one bed, and of course Minako would insist that they
share it.

While sharing a bed with Minako is definitely on the top of Makoto&#39;s
list of enjoyable things, it was hard none the less. As Minako would
sleep Makoto would watch her sleeping all night long. Listening to her
soft breath, wishing she could hold her and tell her how she truly felt.
&quot;Tonight.&quot; she told herself. &quot;Tonight I&#39;m going to tell Minako just how I
feel about her.&quot;

&quot;Dinner sounds good to me. What do you want me to make you?&quot;
Makoto asked already getting nervous at her new goal of telling Minako
how she felt.

&quot;I don&#39;t care, whatever&#39;s good for you. You&#146;re the cook after all.&quot;
Minako smiled at Makoto and as she looked into Makoto&#39;s eyes she had
to look away. &#39;She can be so intense sometimes. Without even trying her
eyes are so intense, and beautiful..&#39; Minako thought. &quot;What time is it
after all?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s almost six. We should probably head back to my place.&#148;

&quot;It&#39;s six already? Where&#39;d the day go?&quot; Minako asked truly confused as
to how it could be six already.

&quot;Well let&#146;s see. When you woke up it was almost 12:30 then you made
me make you breakfast so by the time we left my house it was around
1:30. Then the trip to the mall where you nearly dislocated my shoulder
from pulling on my arm so hard whenever you saw a shirt you like.&quot;

&quot;Sorry about that Mako-chan. I&#39;ll give you a massage tonight to make it
feel better if you like.&quot;

&#39;Breathe Makoto&#39; the brown haired girl kept telling herself. It was just
an offer. Just a massage. But still, skin on skin. &quot;Un, that&#39;d be nice
Minako.&quot;

&quot;Good. So lets get out of here now and get back to your place.&quot;

The two left the arcade and started walking back to Makoto&#39;s apartment.
As Makoto&#39;s apartment building came into view Makoto felt something
soft on her hand and looked to see Minako lightly holding on to it. She
wasn&#39;t completely sure why, but she wasn&#39;t about to fight the fact the
Minako was holding on to her. Instead she took a chance, and laced her
fingers with Minako&#39;s. Neither dared to look at the other and just
walked to Makoto&#39;s knowing full well they had a long night ahead of
them.
