Slowly Usagi opened her eyes. At first she had no idea of where she was 
at all but after blinking a few times upon seeing the room she 
remembered exactly where she was. When she tried to move she found that 
she couldn&#39;t sit up.&#39;God punished me for lying, I am paralyzed!&#39; Was the 
first thing that entered the blonde&#39;s mind. It took her two more seconds 
to calm down.&#39;That&#39;s not possible, think reasonable...&#39;

When Usagi gazed down at her stomach she finally found out why she 
hadn&#39;t been able to move. Michiru&#39;s arm was wrapped around her waist! A 
blush appeared on the blonde&#39;s face. If anyone had walked into them like 
this they would probably have assumed the two sleeping girls were 
lovers. Usagi struggled at bit at trying to escape from Michiru&#39;s grip 
but it wasn&#39;t her who finally managed to push Michiru&#39;s arm away in 
order for her to stand up. Michiru had pulled her arm away herself.

Qiuckly Usagi turned around, Michiru was staring back at her with a 
guilty look on her face.&quot;I am sorry Michiru, I didn&#39;t want to wake you 
up.&quot; Usagi whispered embarrassed. The other just shook her head.

&quot;No I should be saying sorry, it&#39;s kind of a habit to hold the person 
lying next to me...I always held Haruka like that automatically.&quot; 
Michiru replied. She imidiately looked down at her hands after she had 
spoken the blonde tomboy&#39;s name. It still hurt her to talk about Haruka 
in the past tense.

&quot;It&#39;s ok.&quot; Came the other&#39;s voice.&quot;I don&#39;t mind at all, I just wanted to 
get up.&quot; At hearing Usagi speaking those words Michiru gazed up again, 
staring right into the blue eyes of the younger girl.&quot;How are you 
feeling?&quot;

&quot;A lot better.&quot; Michiru answered.&quot;My headache is completely gone, I just 
needed some rest.&quot; The aqua haired girl put up a fake smile. What she 
had just been telling Usagi was nothing more than a lie. She wasn&#39;t 
feeling better at all, a lot worse to be precise. Her headache had 
increased and if that wasn&#39;t enough already also her stomach had decided 
to play against her.

Usagi nodded. She could already see by the looks on the other&#39;s face 
that she wasn&#39;t alright. Michiru looked pale, too pale.&quot;Now why don&#39;t 
you tell me the truth Usagi, you didn&#39;t come here if you had already 
solved your problem. You could&#39;ve called to say you weren&#39;t coming 
anymore...&quot;

The blonde stopped looking at the other at that point, trying to make up 
an excuse. Michiru knew she hadn&#39;t been telling the truth.&quot;I tried 
calling you but you didn&#39;t answer. I got worried and...&quot;

&quot;Try again.&quot; Michiru interrupted the other girl who seemed to be having 
a rough time.&quot;Usagi, you don&#39;t have to tell me if you don&#39;t want to but 
I am just worried about you.&quot; The aqua haired girl went on after not 
getting any reply from Usagi.&quot;You sounded really upset when you called 
me, don&#39;t worry about me. I feel fine. All that&#39;s missing is a warm 
shower now and I will be on my feet before you can say &#39;wow&#39; so if 
that&#39;s why you&#39;re lying to me...Because you&#39;re worried about my health, 
there&#39;s no need for that.&quot;

The other smiled.&quot;You really know how to convince someone, don&#39;t you 
Michiru?&quot; She stated.&quot;But you&#39;re right. I didn&#39;t want you to worry about 
me while you were feeling sick. Last night...I felt so...I don&#39;t know, 
empty. I guess that&#39;s the right word.&quot; Michiru just sat there, listening 
to the blonde.&quot;I mean, you&#39;d say that I would be happy with the life I 
am living now but I am not...&quot; She paused for a moment.

&quot;I love Mamoru, no I like Mamoru but not in the way everyone wants me to 
like him. He&#39;s so nice to me, so wonderful and he makes me happy, he is 
there when I need to talk to someone, when I feel lonely and he&#39;s there 
to hold me through hard times but...To me he&#39;s just like an older 
brother, a good friend.&quot; Another pause.

&quot;But not a lover...&quot; Michiru finished for the blonde girl who was on the 
verge of breaking down into tears.&quot;It&#39;s ok Usagi, Haruka thought the 
same about me. I mean you feel like you have to stick by Mamoru&#39;s side 
because that is your destiny, don&#39;t you?&quot; Usagi just nodded. She could 
see that Michiru was having a hard time comparing Haruka to the 
princess&#39; situation.

&quot;Usagi, no one knows what life will eventually bring. Not even you, 
neither does Setsuna. She may be the guardian of time and is able to see 
parts of the future but no one and I repeat no one is forcing you to be 
with someone you don&#39;t love.&quot; Usagi was crying at this point and much to 
her own surprise, so was Michiru.&#39;I didn&#39;t want her to see me this 
fragile...&#39;

&quot;I am so sorry Michiru.&quot; Usagi sobbed.&quot;I didn&#39;t want to bother you with 
my problems, not now...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s ok, I guess we all need someone to talk to. Even me. I used to 
have Haruka and Setsuna to talk to about my problems but...I don&#39;t think 
telling them nor bothering them with this will do me any good. I want 
them to be happy even if it is together - without me. They should live 
together, being able to wake up every morning feeling the love they feel 
for the other. Not waking up with the feeling of guilt for making me 
feel, like this.&quot; The aqua haired girl wiped away her tears.

&#39;She&#39;s trying to fool me with that tough attitude.&#39; Usagi realised after 
looking at the other for a few seconds.&#39;She&#39;s more like Haruka than she 
thinks.&#39; Haruka never ever tried to show her emotions towards others but 
Usagi had seen through her tough facade easily enough. With Michiru it 
was the same.&quot;Just because they are happy together doesn&#39;t mean that you 
should feel like this Michiru. You are hurt as well, they should&#39;ve been 
more..&quot;

&quot;This isn&#39;t about me Usagi, don&#39;t try to help me. It&#39;s you who is in 
need for help now. I am freed from my fake relationship, you&#39;re still 
stuck.&quot; It was obvious that Michiru had a hard time speaking those 
words. Especially when she mentioned &#39;fake relationship&#39; it was easy to 
see she was trying hard not to break down into tears again.

&quot;It&#39;s not the same. You never knew...&quot;

&quot;So doesn&#39;t Mamoru.&quot; Michiru interrupted the blonde.&quot;He has no clue 
about your true feelings. It is exactly the same. The only thing that is 
different is that you aren&#39;t sleeping with someone else behind his 
back.&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice sounded bitter and cold, Usagi had never heard 
such a tone coming from the older senshi.

&quot;Maybe I should go home and...we can always talk about this later.&quot; 
Usagi tried but the aqua haired girl shook her head.

&quot;I am fine, just lost it. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; She whispered, calming down 
again.&quot;Usagi I don&#39;t know wheter you called me because you needed to 
talk to someone or wheter you needed advice but I think you should be 
true to Mamoru. You may have been lying to him for quite some time but 
even he doesn&#39;t deserve that. He loves you very much but he&#39;s is wasting 
his love for the wrong girl. You can&#39;t let him live a life of lies. No 
one deserves that and I know it first hand. Trust me on this one.&quot;

&quot;I believe you but...&quot; Once again Usagi paused. She knew that Michiru 
was right but how could she tell Mamoru about this? How would he react, 
angry or understanding? Would he be able to talk to her again or would 
it mean goodbye forever?

&quot;But?&quot;

&quot;But, I can&#39;t tell him. I can&#39;t bare losing him. I mean as a friend. But 
I can&#39;t bare being like this any longer either.&quot;

Michiru took a deep breath. This was probably how Haruka had felt as 
well before telling Michiru about Setsuna.&quot;You can&#39;t put your own 
happiness aside for someone else. It will eat you eventually. Do you 
want to live your life in regret every day? Day after day, month after 
month, year after year, feeling your heart die more at every hour that 
passes?&quot;

&quot;No...&quot;

&quot;Then be sincere with Mamoru. If not for him then for yourself. The 
future needs a queen who is happy and who is excited about life, not a 
depressed little old woman who looks older than she truly is.&quot;

&quot;Queen...&quot; Usagi repeated.&quot;That&#39;s another thing...&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, are you having second thoughts about all of this?&quot;

&quot;I am not the type to be a queen. It&#39;s more a thing for Ami. Even Rei 
but not for me. I am just a klutz with bad grades. Who would accept 
someone like me as their ruler? I wouldn&#39;t.&quot; Usagi answered.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Michiru questioned, placing her hand on 
the other&#39;s shoulder.&quot;You would make the best queen ever. Just because 
you are a bit of a klutz and your grades aren&#39;t... Well I just know you 
would make the best queen ever. Besides Chibi-Usa told us, didn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;And Chibi-Usa is exactly the reason for why I have to continue this 
life as Mamoru&#39;s...&quot; Usagi gazed down at the golden band around her 
finger.&quot;As Mamoru&#39;s fianc&eacute;e and soon to be wife.&quot;

Once again Michiru shook her head.&quot;I don&#39;t agree on that one. Do you 
think Chibi-Usa wants to be the child of an unhappy mother and a father 
who is married to a woman who doesn&#39;t see him as a lover but more like 
an older brother, what kind of life would that be?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d be a murderer...If I mess up now I will mess up the future as well. 
I can&#39;t afford that. Besides what would the others think?&quot;

&quot;Screw the others! It&#39;s your life Usagi! Your Life and not the life of 
Rei, Makoto, Ami nor anyone else for that matter. We control our own 
lives. They&#39;re not obligated to marry someone because of our fate and 
neither do you. Times change but I know, I just know that Chibi-Usa will 
be born anyway.&quot; Michiru stated. She sounded a bit impatient and annoyed 
with the other&#39;s innocence and way of looking at things.

&quot;I know!&quot; Usagi yelled. Right after that she calmed down again.&quot;But I&#39;d 
be killing Chibi-Usa and that&#39;s not my life!&quot;

&quot;No but Chibi-Usa isn&#39;t here yet. You can change your future now, just 
walk away from this life and start a new one.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple!&quot; Usagi defended herself.&quot;You have got no clue 
about how hard it is for me to...&quot; She stopped yelling when she suddenly 
felt Michiru&#39;s hand across her face. Michiru had just slapped her!

&quot;How can you say that?!&quot; Michiru cried frustrated.&quot;I didn&#39;t mean to hit 
you but don&#39;t you dare to say I got no clue about how hard it can be too 
say goodbye to someone you love. I had to watch Haruka walk away from me 
together with someone I trusted. I couldn&#39;t do anything about it but you 
can. You can do something!&quot; More tears fell down her cheeks as she 
turned away. She didn&#39;t want the other to see her cry.

&quot;I am sorry...&quot; Usagi whispered, placing her hand on the place where 
Michiru had just hit her.&quot;I am sorry...&quot; She repeated. Michiru didn&#39;t do 
anything besides sitting there on the edge of the bed, staring down at 
the floor as she was shaking. Just when she was about to turn back to 
face Usagi she could feel two arms encircle her waist. In shock she 
gazed up only to be rewarded by a smile from the blonde girl.&quot;I am 
sorry...&quot; She said once more before pulling Michiru into a tight hug.

Michiru wanted to push Usagi away at first but the feeling of being held 
seemed to comfort her in some way. Slowly she started to return the hug 
as more tears fell down her face.&quot;I am sorry too...&quot; Michiru finally 
whispered, realising that she shouldn&#39;t have lost her temper with the 
younger blonde like she had done just a few minutes ago. They just sat 
there for a long time, enjoying the feeling of being held until Michiru 
suddenly felt another stinging pain in her head and pulled away.

&quot;Are you ok?&quot; Usagi imidiately caught the older senshi before she fell 
off the bed.

&quot;I am fine...Just a bit dizzy.&quot; Michiru lied. The truth was that she was 
feeling far from fine.

&quot;Don&#39;t lie to me, I&#39;ve seen it before but I didn&#39;t want to mention 
anything.&quot; Usagi pressed as she helped the aqua haired girl lay down on 
the bed again. Michiru was still wearing the robe from last night so 
luckily for Usagi she didn&#39;t have to help Michiru to get undressed and 
wear something more comfortable.&quot;Here lay down.&quot;

&quot;Usagi you don&#39;t have to...I am fine...Just..&quot; She got cut off by the 
other.

&quot;Dizzy, yes yes I know but I say you have to lay down and rest.&quot; Usagi 
replied with an innocent smile on her face.

&quot;And If I say no?&quot; Michiru wondered out loud.

&quot;Then I&#39;d say, I am your future queen so you don&#39;t have a chance, then 
I&#39;d do this...&quot; Usagi said as she put the covers around the aqua haired 
girl.

&quot;Ah and now you suddenly want to be the queen after all eh?&quot; Michiru 
joked, enjoying the feeling of being under such a good care. This wasn&#39;t 
something she was used to when she was still dating Haruka.

&quot;Only when it works in my advantage.&quot; The blonde replied.&quot;Now try to get 
some sleep ok?&quot;

&quot;How about you?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind...I want to watch some tv.&quot; Usagi blushed, hoping 
Michiru would ignore the obvious fact that Usagi didn&#39;t want to go home 
to face Mamoru.

&quot;Sure...But you know you have to face him soon.&quot; Michiru replied, giving 
Usagi an honest smile before closing her eyes.

&quot;I know.&quot; Came the reply.&quot;Now rest.&quot; And with that Usagi closed the 
bedroom door behind her. She didn&#39;t know what had come over her all of a 
sudden but being here with Michiru made her problems look like such 
small things. Michiru had just lost the person she truly loved and if 
that wasn&#39;t worse enough she was now stuck with Usagi while having a 
fever. It was only natural for Usagi to feel like she had to care of the 
other senshi at this point. But on the other hand, she did know that 
Michiru was right. Sooner or later she would have to face Mamoru who 
still thought she was with Rei.

---

&quot;Rei Hino speaking.&quot; The voice from the other side of the line came.

&quot;Hey Rei, this is Mamoru. I was wondering if Usagi is still there.&quot; The 
black haired man said, a frown appearing on his face. Usagi hadn&#39;t told 
him she would stay about all night and day. It wasn&#39;t like her not to 
call him or inform him about such a thing. Maybe something had happened.

&quot;Still here?&quot; The raven haired girl questioned, not understanding what 
he meant.

&quot;Usagi, you called her last night, right?&quot; Mamoru asked.

Rei shook her head but when she realised he couldn&#39;t see her since they 
were on the phone she answered with a simple no. &quot;So you didn&#39;t call her 
last night?&quot; He tried again. Once more Rei replied by saying that she 
hadn&#39;t called Usagi at all, atleast not last night.

&quot;Okay, thanks anyway and I am sorry to bother you.&quot; Mamoru politely said 
and before Rei could ask anything else he had already hung up.

With an upset and confused look on his face Mamoru leaned against the 
wall behind him. Where could Usagi have gone to then and why had she 
lied to him about going to Rei? Was it possible that the reason for 
Usagi&#39;s odd behaviour of lately was because she was seeing some other 
guy? A lot of crazy thoughts like that entered the black haired man&#39;s 
mind.

--

Rei held the phone in her hands for a few seconds before hanging up as 
well.&quot;Who was it?&quot; A voice asked. The raven haired girl turned around to 
face the blonde girl who sat behind her on the couch.

&quot;Mamoru, he wanted to know if I called Usagi last night to come over.&quot; 
Rei replied as she walked towards the blonde girl.

&quot;I am the living proof that you didn&#39;t.&quot; The blonde girl said with a 
giggle.&quot;After all you spend the whole night with me. I think even the 
neighbours can confirm that story by all the screams...&quot;

&quot;Minako!&quot; The senshi of fire yelled, turning red.

&quot;Ok, ok. I was just saying. Anyway, why would Mamoru assume you called 
Usagi over?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s obvious. She told him she was coming over but...&quot; The raven 
haired girl was cut off by the blonde.

&quot;Do you think they got into a fight and Usagi ran away?&quot; She questioned.

&quot;Usagi is not the type to fight. Maybe she is...Nah never mind.&quot;

Minako raised an eyebrow.&quot;Not the type to fight? Must I remind you of 
her attitude around Seiya, Mamoru and you in the past?&quot;

&quot;She has changed.&quot; Rei stated.

&quot;So you think she is seeing someone else?&quot; Minako asked, the other 
eyebrow went up as well.

&quot;Usagi? Our Usagi? No way but she&#39;s hiding something. We&#39;ll ask about it 
tomorrow at our meeting.&quot; Rei said. Even though they weren&#39;t senshi 
anymore, or atleast since there was no need for the senshi anymore they 
had decided to keep having their senshi meetings. Luna had said it was 
to make sure they were prepared for their future but everyone knew it 
was more a way of making sure they wouldn&#39;t fall apart or lose contact.

&quot;Great, now that is solved, how about inviting me over to your room 
again?&quot; Minako asked with a wink causing Rei to blush even more than she 
had done before.
