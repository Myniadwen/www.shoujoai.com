<h1>Striking Out</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note:  This story was inspired by an odd thing I noticed 
in a relatively early episode.  I&#39;m not sure which one and don&#39;t 
feel like researching it, but it takes place very soon after 
Sailor Jupiter is revealed.  Usagi is late for a meeting and 
Makoto, Rei, Ami, and Luna are discussing her qualifications for 
leadership.  While Luna is urging the others to give Usagi a 
chance, supported by Makoto, Ami begins to agree.  Suddenly, Rei 
pinches her and Ami changes her tune, supporting Rei.  Later, as 
Sailor Jupiter rushes to help Sailor Moon in a fight, she 
comments that &#39;Ami and Rei are on strike&#39;.  I think it is the 
only case in the series where one or more of the Inners actively 
refuses to help Sailor Moon when she&#39;s in trouble.  Odd incident.  
Here&#39;s my take on what might have been going on that night.   The 
characterization is not typical, but I&#39;m trying to convey what 
these two were like right at the beginning, before all of the 
changes that being Sailor Senshi (and being close to Usagi) 
brought about in them.

---------------------------

Ami stood by the window staring out at the night.  Purposely, she 
unclenched her fists, trying to release some of the tension that 
she felt building inside.  Every part of her being quivered with 
the need to go, to help, to protect, but still she stood.  
Changing her focus, she peeked at the reflection in the glass.   
Behind her, Rei sat folding laundry and stacking it neatly.  Her 
movements were quick and precise and Ami could see in them the 
same tension that she felt herself. 

&quot;There still might be time,&quot; Ami began to suggest.

&quot;No!&quot; Rei shouted, much more loudly than she&#39;d intended.  Ami 
flinched from the light blazing in her lover&#39;s eyes.  Calming 
herself, Rei continued, &quot;We&#39;ve made our decision, Ami-chan.  If 
Makoto-san and that cat think _she_ should lead, then she can 
prove it tonight.&quot;

&quot;But, Rei-chan...&quot;

&quot;I said &#39;No&#39;, Ami-chan!&quot; Rei insisted.  Again, her temper flared 
and again, she controlled it.  Standing primly, Rei moved to the 
window and took Ami in her arms.  &quot;Ami-chan, what we are doing is 
too important. We have to find the Moon Princess and protect her 
at all costs.  What sort of protection can we provide with that 
meatball head in charge?&quot;

Ami slumped into Rei&#39;s arms and nodded passively.  Rei&#39;s words 
had some logic to them, but Ami couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that 
what they were doing was wrong.  While she loved Rei, or thought 
she did, Ami didn&#39;t like the way those feelings more and more 
often led her to do or say things she didn&#39;t really believe.  She 
could still feel the sting of Rei&#39;s pinch from earlier.  

As Rei stroked her hair and whispered that everything would be 
all right, Ami tried to sort out exactly what had happened in her 
life over the past few months.  Before she&#39;d met Usagi, she&#39;d 
been a lonely bookworm focused entirely on her schoolwork.  Ami 
had never even realized how much she missed having friends until 
she had actually made some.  Then, they&#39;d met Rei.  Rei was 
everything that Ami was not:  beautiful, spiritual, expressive.  
Both she and Usagi had been fascinated by Rei from the moment 
they&#39;d first spied her in her temple, even before she had been 
revealed as Sailor Mars.   While Rei and Usagi seemed to fight 
more often than not, Ami and Rei had formed a quick bond.  While 
Ami had always known that her feelings toward girls, and boys, 
were not &#39;normal&#39;, it had been Rei who had helped her come to 
terms with her feelings.  

Ami could still recall the feel of Rei&#39;s lips on her own that 
afternoon in the temple.  Rei had finally gotten her to admit to 
herself the truth about her sexuality, a revelation born in 
tears.  As she&#39;d sat, huddled in her own arms crying softly, Rei 
had approached her, embraced her, whispered comforts in her ear.  
And then, she&#39;d kissed her.  While she was in awe of Rei&#39;s 
beauty, she had never looked at her in that light, but at that 
moment, it had been impossible to resist her.  

In the weeks since, they&#39;d struggled to keep their new 
relationship a secret from Usagi.  Ami was still unsure how her 
new friend would react to such an admission.  Rei seemed almost 
pathologically determined to keep the secret as well.  
Truthfully, most of their relationship centered on the need to 
keep the secret.  Well, that and the intensely passionate 
physical side of things.  Ami blushed to think at some of the 
desires that Rei had awoken inside of her.  Even now, Ami could 
sense the growing need in Rei&#39;s embrace as her caresses grew more 
forceful, more purposeful.

Even as Rei began kissing her neck, part of Ami remained 
detached, for once not letting herself get lost in the sensations 
aroused by soft lips and firm touch.  How often had Ami allowed 
Rei to distract her from an important conversation with a swift 
embrace and passionate kiss?  Ami felt Rei gently sliding her 
down to the floor, but as if from somewhere else.  Strangely, an 
image of Makoto flashed in her mind.  Ami prayed that Rei had not 
noticed the way she looked at Makoto, a girl who had seemingly 
stepped directly out of Ami&#39;s fantasies and into her reality.  

&quot;Rei-chan, stop,&quot; Ami whispered distantly.  

Rei lifted her head from the nape of Ami&#39;s neck, her hands 
pausing on the buttons of her blouse.  &quot;What&#39;s wrong, Ami-chan?  
Are you uncomfortable?  Should we move to the couch?&quot;

Ami shifted out from under Rei so she could sit up against the 
wall. &quot;No, Rei-chan, it&#39;s not that.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not about Usagi again, is it?&quot; Rei asked in an irritated 
tone.

&quot;No, Rei-chan, it&#39;s about you and I.  I...&quot; Ami paused to gather 
herself.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure this is right.&quot;

&quot;You mean being gay?&quot; Rei asked incredulously.  &quot;How could you 
think such a thing?&quot;

&quot;Not that, Rei-chan,&quot; Ami continued, clinging desperately to this 
line of thought before it was lost in another torrent.  &quot;You and 
I.  It&#39;s not right.   I love you, Rei-chan, but I don&#39;t think I 
love you like this.&quot;

Rei sat up rigidly, glaring at Ami with violet eyes clouded by a 
growing mist.  &quot;What do you mean?  Because of tonight?  If it 
means that much to you, go... go to her!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not about her, Rei-chan,&quot; Ami pleaded, &quot;it&#39;s about you, and 
me.  I just don&#39;t think I&#39;m ready for this.  I was barely ready 
to admit that I have these feelings for other girls.  It&#39;s like I 
haven&#39;t been in control of myself ever since this all began.&quot;  

Ami could see the emotions flashing across Rei&#39;s face:  anger, 
hurt, confusion.  She waited vainly for understanding, but it did 
not come so quickly.  

&quot;This is all about her, it&#39;s always about her,&quot; Rei accused.  
&quot;First Luna, then Makoto, and now you.  Why does everyone keep 
shoving her at me?  Why can&#39;t I escape from her?  

&quot;She&#39;s a part of our lives, Rei-chan.  She&#39;s one of us, the first 
one, and she&#39;s a good friend, to both of us,&quot; Ami replied.  &quot;She 
loves us both, Rei-chan, and we both love her.&quot;  

Rei shot Ami a terrified glance.  &quot;I don&#39;t love her!  She&#39;s a 
ditz and a klutz and I don&#39;t love her! I love you, Ami-chan, 
you!&quot;  The incoherent pain in Rei&#39;s shouts pained Ami to her 
core.  

&quot;I love you, too, Rei-chan, but I&#39;m not in love with you, not in 
this way.  It&#39;s not fair for me to pretend any more,&quot; Ami 
whispered, heartbroken.  In the midst of this despair, however, 
the mists of the future parted briefly and a vision of one she 
could love like that shone through.  It gave her the strength to 
cling to her resolve.  &quot;You deserve better.&quot;

&quot;Get out!&quot; Rei yelled.  &quot;Get out!&quot;   

Ami tried to hold her, even as Rei pummeled her with her fists.   
This time, it was Ami&#39;s turn to hold on while Rei ran the gamut 
of emotions.  Rei&#39;s yells soon became muffled as she pressed 
herself against her friend.  Ami could feel the tears through the 
thin material of her blouse, could sense the tremors in Rei&#39;s 
body as she quivered in her arms.  

Slowly, a new sound arose and Ami could eventually make out 
what Rei was murmuring against her.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Ami-chan, I&#39;m so 
sorry,&quot; Rei whispered over and over again.  

Ami pulled back and drew Rei&#39;s face up carefully, wiping the 
tears from her cheeks with gentle fingers.  &quot;Silly Rei-chan, why 
are you apologizing to me?  I am the one who is sorry, who should 
be sorry.  I&#39;ve been misleading you.&quot;  Ami&#39;s voice caught on her 
own tears, lodged deeply in her throat.  

&quot;No, Ami-chan, you&#39;re right. I think I&#39;ve known, too.&quot;  Rei took 
a deep breath and cuddled up against Ami&#39;s chest.  &quot;I&#39;d been 
trying for so long to deal with my feelings and then when you 
admitted that you were gay too, it just seemed so natural that we 
should be together.  It felt so right, Ami-chan, and also so 
wrong.&quot;

Ami smiled, blushing slightly at the memories of the parts that 
had indeed felt quite right.  &quot;Even a genius can be stupid 
sometimes, Rei-chan.  Even a priestess can make a mistake.&quot;  

&quot;It&#39;s more than that,&quot; Rei continued, feeling the weight lifting 
off of her shoulders as she spoke.  &quot;Everyone is always so 
focused on Usagi, that I just wanted to feel special myself.  Our 
little secret gave me that, but when you started to take her side 
today, I felt like I was being left with nothing.&quot;  

&quot;Oh Rei-chan, you know I think you&#39;d be a wonderful leader,&quot; Ami 
admitted. &quot;I think you both would be.  And you will always be 
special, especially to me.&quot;

Rei smiled wanly up at Ami and nuzzled her a little closer. &quot;I&#39;m 
sorry I pinched you.  Do you think they&#39;re all right?&quot;

&quot;If things were going poorly, I&#39;m sure they would call us,&quot; Ami 
surmised. 

&quot;Is it ok if you just hold me a little while longer then,&quot; Rei 
asked softly, her voice trembling with uncertainty.   

&quot;Of course, Rei-chan,&quot; Ami murmured, &quot;of course.&quot;  

And as Ami held Rei close, stroking her long black hair lovingly, 
she realized how very lucky she was to have a friend like this, 
and how fortunate she was not to have lost her.  

And as Rei lay in Ami&#39;s lap, she thought once again of the blonde 
girl who had turned her life upside down.  The girl who, no 
matter how hard Rei tried, no matter what Rei did, lingered in 
her thoughts and haunted her dreams....
