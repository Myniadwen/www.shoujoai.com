<h1>Enchante (part 2 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/enchante-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>I cursed the unnatural heat as I felt another sweat drop trickle down 
my back. It had seemed like such a good idea this morning to wear my 
motorcycle leathers. The feel and smell of the leather, the roar of 
the wind, even the weight of the helmet, free me from the burden of my 
thoughts. The purr of my bike between my legs is sensual, but it is 
also powerful. I had needed this ride badly and I had enjoyed it. But 
now the sun burned me and made the sweat run down my back.

I could feel the sting of salt in the corner of my eye and bit back a 
curse. The sun was damnably hot and the leather now clung to me 
uncomfortably. I pulled up at a stop light and removed my helmet, 
drawing a handkerchief from my bag. This particular handkerchief was a 
gift from Michiru. She fastened it around my arm one day before a 
race, &quot;as a token,&quot; as if I were a knight riding into battle. I always 
keep it on me when I ride now. I wiped away the sweat from my forehead 
and replaced the helmet, just as the light turned green. 

I shifted into first and let the roar of the engine envelop me. I was 
cruising now, not far from home and more than ready for a bath.

I could see people walking along the sidewalk, most looking as 
fatigued from the heat as I felt, when a familiar figure caught my 
eye. I pulled over and slowed, pulling alongside a girl in a short red 
dress, walking stiffly, her head down, obviously preoccupied.

&quot;Oi, Rei-chan!&quot; I called to gain her attention. Even before she spun 
around to face me I knew something was wrong. At the sound of my voice 
she had nearly leapt out of her skin. Her eyes were a bit wild as she 
turned and her face was definitely grayish. I actually reached out a 
hand to steady her. I wasn&#146;t sure she&#146;d remain on her feet, she looked 
so shaky. 

&quot;Oh, Haruka-san...&quot; she said, obviously relieved and a bit annoyed. &quot;I 
didn&#146;t hear you ride up.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m sorry I startled you.&quot; I began, but she waved it off. The color 
had returned to her face, but her eyes were still unnaturally bright. 
It looked as if she had not gotten much sleep recently. &quot;Well, then, 
can I give you a ride somewhere to make it up to you?&quot; She perked up 
at this suggestion and I pulled my extra helmet out of the carrier. 
She pulled her hair into a ponytail and put the helmet on, seating 
herself behind me. I could feel her arms slip around my waist, feel 
the already clinging leather adhere to my skin. I turned slightly and 
said over my shoulder, &quot;Where to?&quot;

She jumped slightly. &quot;I don&#146;t care.&quot; came the peculiar answer. I 
shrugged a bit, kicked the engine into first gear and took off. 

As we rode, I could feel Rei behind me, settling her arms around me, 
leaning into me and finally, gently, laying her head against my back. 
I took us for a spin around Ichinohashi Park and through the Juuban 
shopping district. I was just about to turn up towards Hikawa Shrine, 
when I felt her stiffen. 

&quot;Please, Haruka-san - I don&#146;t want to go home yet.&quot;

It wasn&#146;t a problem, I turned the other way and headed for my 
apartment. I needed a bath and maybe the girl might find a swim 
relaxing. At the least I could be hospitable and serve her tea. She 
looked as if there was a great weight on her mind. Maybe she just 
needed someone to talk to.

I parked my bike and helped Rei off the back. I pulled the helmet off 
of my head with a sigh. &quot;Would you care to come up for some tea?&quot; I 
asked politely, watching her face for discomfort.

She seemed distracted, but agreed, just as politely.

The air conditioning was on in the apartment - Michiru had been and 
gone. I could feel the sweat pooling on my body in the cool air and I 
shivered.

Rei looked around unobtrusively and I told her to make herself 
comfortable. &quot;I&#146;m sorry, but I absolutely need a shower at least 
before I can even remotely be of use.&quot; I grinned at her, running my 
fingers through my soaked hair. She smiled understandingly.

&quot;Of course.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;ll be quick about it.&quot; I hopped into the bathroom and laboriously 
stripped off my leathers. The boots aren&#146;t a problem, but peeling the 
suit off of me was truly disgusting. I laughed at my own squeamishness 
and turned on the shower. I glanced longingly at the bathtub, it was 
calling my name. My muscles were stiff from the ride, but it would 
have been rude to keep Rei waiting long. I stepped into the stream of 
the water and let the heat strip me of sweat and grime. What a sinful 
pleasure cleanliness is.

I grabbed shampoo and lathered my hair. There was a soft noise, but I 
could not see past the soap on my face and hair, so I ignored it. I 
continued to rub the soap into my scalp, when a hand reached out and 
touched my back. 

I jumped high enough to hit the showerhead with my head. I spun 
around, soap running into my eyes, making it hard to see.

&quot;Michiru! Don&#146;t scare me like that!&quot; I assumed the noise I had heard 
was Michiru entering the apartment. I looked down, but my eyes had to 
drop an inch or two lower before I found another pair of eyes looking 
up somberly at me. I stepped back in surprise.

&quot;Rei-chan!&quot; The girl was naked, but her long, dark hair was clothing 
enough. Her eyes were wide and maybe a little frightened, but not of 
me. She looked desperate and it scared me. &quot;Rei-chan, what...&quot;

&quot;Please Haruka-san...&quot; she hesitated. &quot;I need...&quot; Her voice was barely 
above a whisper. &quot;Hold me.&quot; And her voice cracked. I have never 
considered myself a maternal person, but at that moment I would have 
fought an army to protect her. Rinsing the last of the shampoo from my 
hair, I drew her in close, holding her to my chest. I let the warm 
water run over the both of us, carrying away whatever it was that 
pained her. 

A moment or two went by in silence, then I could feel her shudder. I 
released her quickly, thinking she had thought better of this, but she 
held on to me tightly. The shakes passed quickly and she began to 
speak in a quiet monotone.

&quot;It was a fox spirit, and it was killing the girl. I&#146;ve never done an 
exorcism before...&quot; she shuddered again and buried her face in my 
chest. After a moment she looked up, haunted by what she had seen. 
&quot;She had my eyes...&quot; I looked down at her, dark hair plastered to her 
body, glimpses of pale skin through the blackness and I felt a fire 
build within me. Leaning down, I kissed her gently on the eyelids. She 
laid her head against my chest. I stood, not moving. I am not an 
entirely immoral person and I don&#146;t force myself on anyone, especially 
not young vulnerable girls. 

Rei lifted her head and touched my hair with one hand. &quot;You still have 
soap in your hair. Let me rinse it for you.&quot; and she pressed on my 
shoulders, until I sat on the small bench behind me. I let her run her 
hands through my hair, drawing all the soap out and when it was gone, 
still, she ran her hands through my hair. I looked up at her, one 
breast showing through the cloak of hair. Her nipple was pale pink, 
slowly darkening to rose as blood rushed to it. She looked down at me 
and pulled my face closer to her. I let her, until my nose just barely 
brushed her skin. Still looking her in the eyes, I lifted one hand to 
her and taking her breast in it, I closed the gap between us and 
kissed her. Her eyes closed, her hands stayed in my hair, moving in 
slow circles.

As the water cascaded over and around us, I took her in my mouth, 
rolling my tongue along her hard nipple. Nipping at her with my teeth 
I took her other breast in my other hand. She crushed me to her and 
sighed. &quot;Yes, please, suck on me.&quot; And I did, nursing on her beautiful 
soft breasts while the water washed us clean.

Rei moaned as I scraped my teeth across her nipple, and she arced her 
back, pressing me into her. I took one of her hands, and lowered it to 
my own breast. Her eyes opened, then closed, then opened. She pushed 
me away, then kneeled next to me, taking me in her hands, she pinched 
and rolled my nipples until all it was all I could to remember to 
breathe.

I looked down at her once more and desire flamed once again in me. She 
was so beautiful, her hair sticking to her strong body, her eyes 
closed in pleasure. I took her head in my hands and lifted it to me, 
kissing her deeply. We kissed for a long time. Her lips were soft, 
yielding and warm. Her tongue teased at the corner of my mouth and I 
laughed. She looked me in the eyes as we kissed, I stared right back, 
wanting to see the flame of passion ignite within her. She broke away, 
and brushed all her hair back, revealing herself to me for the first 
time. Her body was that of a young goddess, strong, well-formed, 
lightly muscled. She reached over and grabbed the soap from the niche. 
She pulled me up with one hand and began to lather my body up, paying 
particular attention to certain crevices, niches and areas. Her hand, 
slick with soap, reached in between my legs and I caught my breath. 
Her fingers stroked up and down my slit, losing themselves inside me, 
then drawing out again and playing with my clit. I could feel her 
other hand running along my lower back and into the crack of my butt. 
I felt soapy hands slide into my ass and I cried out with the feeling. 
I could hear her laugh to have such complete control over me, but I 
didn&#146;t care at the moment. She sped her motions and I thrust forward, 
trying to capture every last bit of the sensation of being filled. 
With a small cry I came, leaning heavily on Rei, panting as my orgasm 
washed over me. 

Her hand slowed, then went away. I almost cried out for it, but I knew 
there was another thing I had to do first. Reaching over Rei&#146;s 
shoulder, I turned off the water, then pulled the girl with me, 
towards the bathtub. We reached the tub, I sat her firmly on its edge 
and reverently parted her legs. Her bush was dark and wet, not only 
with the water of the shower. Leaning forward, I ran one finger down 
her slit and watched her as her eyes closed, her head rolled back and 
her mouth went slack. I needed her, I needed to touch her. I attacked 
her center with my tongue, stabbing, darting, licking and finally 
sucking on her clit until she began to moan incessantly. I lowered 
myself a little, and thrust my tongue into her. To my delight she 
pulled me into her, crushing my head to her. I thrust harder and 
deeper with my tongue as she moaned her need. When the pressure of her 
hands let up, I moved back to her clit and began to stroke it softly 
with my tongue. One hand found a nipple and began to play with it. 
With a sudden jerk and a soft cry, Rei came for me. I continued to 
lick her until she pushed my head away. 

Her legs closed and I laid my head on them, while she stroked my hair. 
I could feel her heart pounding and she took a few moments to catch 
her breath. I stayed on my knees, until I thought that if I did not 
move, I might not be able to again. Standing slowly, I helped Rei up 
and over into the bathtub itself.

The water was warm, after the cold floor, and my body began to relax. 
I leaned back and let my head rest on the tub&#146;s edge. I felt Rei lay 
her head on my chest and I put my arms around her.

My thoughts drifted for a while. I looked down at Rei, who looked 
peaceful, much better than when I had first seen her that day. I 
kissed her head and she smiled at me.

&quot;Thank you.&quot; she said.

&quot;It was my pleasure.&quot; I replied honestly.

A short time later I gave her a ride home on my motorcycle. She 
thanked me again and smiled sweetly as she returned my helmet to me. 
As she walked away into the cool evening air, I could see that the 
bounce had returned to her step and her body seemed free of the burden 
it had carried earlier. I smiled at her back and kicked the bike into 
gear. It was time to go home.</pre>
