----------------------------------------------------------------------

Serenity sighed as she wandered around her garden, holding one red rose 
in her hand.  Prince Endymion was fond of roses, red ones especially.  
Now that her mother knew about her clandestine trips to Earth, she was 
constantly watched and confined to the palace.  &quot;It&#39;s not fair,&quot; she 
muttered.  &quot;It&#39;s just not fair.  I love him so much.&quot;
 
&quot;It really isn&#39;t fair, Koneko-chan.&quot;
 
Serenity spun at the voice, smiling at the visitor&#39;s use of her pet 
name.  &quot;Haruka-san!&quot;
 
The princess bowed, a smile on her lips.  &quot;Good morning, Koneko-chan.  
It sounds to me like you told your mother of your exploits.&quot;
 
&quot;When you left, apparently you told her that you knew with whom I am 
falling in love.  She asked me for his name, and I gave it to her.  I 
have not been allowed to leave the palace since.&quot;
 
&quot;Forgive me, my princess.  I did not mean to hurt you or your prince.&quot;
 
Serenity laid her hand on Haruka&#39;s arm.  &quot;No, my protector.  I should 
have told her sooner.  She does not want me to be unhappy, but she 
cannot allow me to marry a prince of Earth.  She&#39;s right, but I love him 
too much to let him go.&quot;
 
&quot;Would you like to see him again?&quot;
 
Serenity&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;You can do that?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, if you help me.  I brought a friend with me, and we need to speak 
to you, alone, preferably somewhere your mother will not peek in.  If 
she does, there could be trouble.&quot;
 
&quot;Take me to your friend, then, Haruka-san.&quot;
 
&quot;Let me go speak to your mother first.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
&quot;I understand perfectly, Majesty.  I have had some practice running just 
my kingdom and there is no easy day.  But your daughter?  Are you sure 
she was on Earth?&quot;
 
Serenity nodded, sipping her tea as delicately as the princess of 
Kaiousei tasted hers.  &quot;She told me so herself.  I am glad that she did 
not lie, but Earthlings do not live for very long.  She loves him now, 
but soon he will die and she will be lonely.  I know what it is to be 
lonely and she should not feel that pain for a very long time.&quot;
 
&quot;I, too, lost my father very long ago, before I could even remember him.  
I know why Serenity seeks love and finds it in such an unlikely place.  
I wish there was a way I could help.&quot;
 
&quot;Unless you could introduce her to a nice young duke or lord from any 
planet but Earth, I do not think so.&quot;
 
&quot;Perhaps I can be of some help, Your Majesty.&quot;
 
Queen Serenity turned, eyes wide at the voice considered by most to be 
deep enough for a young man&#39;s rather than a woman&#39;s.  &quot;Haruka-kun!  You 
returned.&quot;
 
Haruka inclined her head; she was now dressed in a pale green suit 
accented by gold edging and her beautifully decorated sword, black boots 
exchanged for white.  She also wore the symbol of her planet as golden 
earrings.  &quot;I did, Majesty, after the young princess of Neptune showed 
me that I still have a great deal to offer.  Your daughter is confined 
to this palace where there are no men at all from which she can choose a 
suitable mate.  Even the son of a wealthy merchant in the city would be 
a far better match for the Moon Princess than a prince of Earth.  Let 
Michiru-san and me take your daughter into the city and to the mansions 
and lesser castles of the dukes and lords of the Moon.  Once she sees 
what&#39;s out there, she may wish to travel to other planets and choose a 
husband.  At least she will not be depressing herself with thoughts of 
the Earth Prince Endymion anymore.&quot;
 
The queen sighed, staring into her teacup.  &quot;I fear that I may never be 
able to make my only child happy, Haruka-kun.  Take her into the city, 
but keep one of my guards with you at all times.  I will protect her, no 
matter what.  Michiru-san, Haruka-kun, I can offer you rooms for tonight 
when you return from escorting my Serenity around the city.  By the way, 
Haruka-kun; does your father know what you&#39;ve been up to?&quot;
 
Haruka rested one hand on her sword hilt, a challenge in her altered 
stance.  &quot;Did you tell him that I was here?&quot;
 
&quot;Koshu-kun and I do not speak much anymore.&quot;
 
&quot;Because of my mother,&quot; Haruka realized.  &quot;You cared for Kazeko as all 
of the senshi did, but you alone had the power to save her.  When you 
contacted your husband and told him that the queen of Uranus would not 
survive her daughter&#39;s birth, you did not want Koshu to know.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-kun&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;Because he would beg you to use the maboroshi no ginzuishou and you 
could not.&quot;
 
Serenity stared up at the young senshi, eyes wide.  &quot;Kazeko-chan is 
inside you.  Some part of her remains to guide her daughter.  She knew, 
Haruka-kun.  She knew that I could save her, but it would cost me my 
life and she would not allow it.  The ginzuishou cannot dispense power 
indiscriminately, and Kazeko would not let me die for her.  I managed to 
use some power to save her child, to save you, but neither Koshu nor 
Shousha has ever forgiven me for not saving the one woman that meant the 
most to both of them.&quot;
 
&quot;And you don&#39;t want to make Serenity ever face that choice as you did.&quot;
 
Queen Serenity nodded at Michiru&#39;s words.  &quot;I can&#39;t let her lose someone 
and know that she could have done something, should have done 
something.&quot;
 
Haruka laid her hands on the queen&#39;s shoulders, forcing her to look up.  
&quot;I don&#39;t blame you, Serenity-san, and I know that my father doesn&#39;t, 
either.  Not really.  He knows the risks of a Senshi&#39;s life and the 
choices we must make.  And Shousha is just lonely.  She lost both of her 
parents, her first and only son, Kazeko, and her husband all in a very 
short amount of time.  She only hates me because I lived and my mother 
died.  She does not blame you and she never really did.&quot;
 
Serenity smiled.  &quot;You really do have something to offer, Haruka-kun.  
Go; take my daughter into the city.  I will see you tonight.  And don&#39;t 
worry; I won&#39;t tell your father.&quot;
 
Haruka bowed as she and Michiru left, walking close enough to touch but 
just barely not.  The queen of the Moon watched them leave, wondering 
just what had happened on Kaiousei.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka followed Serenity and her guard, waiting for the right moment to 
relieve themselves of the extra burden.  The guard would not approve of 
a trip to Earth.  Michiru touched Haruka&#39;s hand, indicating that she 
would distract him long enough for Haruka to strike.  With all the grace 
given to her as Shousha&#39;s daughter, Michiru sauntered past the guard, 
gazing at the necklaces on display in the next shop.  &quot;Aren&#39;t these so 
pretty?  What do you think?&quot;
 
The guard shrugged, obviously interested in the princess.  &quot;I&#39;ve seen 
better.  You deserve more than theses petty charms.  We could&#151;&quot;
 
The guard fell to the ground, unconscious, Haruka standing above him, 
her arms crossed.  &quot;You didn&#39;t have to flirt with him like that.&quot;
 
&quot;Like what, Haruka?&quot;  Michiru walked past her lover and kissed her cheek 
lightly.  &quot;It&#39;s all for the mission.  We&#39;d better put him somewhere 
while we&#39;re gone.&quot;
 
&quot;I have a friend near here,&quot; Serenity volunteered.  &quot;You can tell me 
what you wanted to talk to me about there.&quot;
 
When the guard from the palace opened the door, Haruka started.  &quot;It&#39;s 
you,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;I remember you from the palace.&quot;
 
&quot;I do have to live somewhere, you know.  I only work in the palace.  
Serenity-san, what do you need?&quot;
 
&quot;We&#39;d like for you to watch over a friend for us while we&#39;re gone.  He&#39;s 
not currently conscious, a bit too much excitement for one day, and my 
friends and I have things we need to do.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d be glad to help you, Serenity-san.  Bring your friends in.  Welcome 
to my house, Haruka-kun.  And you, miss?&quot;
 
&quot;I am Michiru.  Your house is very welcoming.&quot;  Haruka, who had been 
carrying the guard, laid him in one of the chairs in the room.  The 
controller excused himself for a moment so his three visitors could 
discuss their plans for the rest of the day.
 
Haruka sighed as she sat down beside Michiru and across from Serenity.  
&quot;Koneko-chan, we came here because Michiru and I are going to get 
married.&quot;
 
Serenity&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;Uso!  You can&#39;t be serious!  It&#39;s not legal 
for two royal women to wed!  Especially senshi, Haruka-san!&quot;
 
The taller woman smiled, and Serenity knew that she had planned 
something devious.  &quot;We did not plan this, Koneko-chan, but Shousha-sama 
caught us together and ordered us to marry.  Immediately, in fact.&quot;
 
&quot;She thought you were a man,&quot; Serenity whispered.  &quot;There is no way a 
priest will marry the two of you, Haruka-san.  Besides, he or she would 
have to report to the reigning monarch of the kingdom where you wed.&quot;
 
&quot;My Haruka has solved that problem,&quot; Michiru laughed.  &quot;She just 
happened to have a friend priest who would perform the ceremony, and 
Earth is not part of the Silver Millennium.&quot;
 
&quot;Earth?  Haruka-san!  You can&#39;t go to Earth!&quot;
 
&quot;Why not?  You do.&quot;
 
&quot;But my mother&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;Will never find out,&quot; Haruka assured the princess.  &quot;You&#39;ll be able to 
see your prince, witness our wedding, get away from the moon for a 
while, and your mother will never know.  Neither will Michiru&#39;s if we 
can help it.&quot;
 
Serenity smiled and shook her head.  &quot;You guys are a bad influence on 
me.&quot;
 
&quot;Great!  Come on, then; we have to meet the priest in a different, 
quieter part of town very soon.  Before Earth-rise, anyway.  Oh, we 
ought to get some nice peasant cloaks from your friend while we&#39;re at 
it.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;ll speak to him.  Haruka-san, I know that you did not plan your 
wedding just so I could see Endymion again, but I appreciate it.&quot;
 
&quot;Anytime, Koneko-chan.  My princess.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Kiyoshi waited patiently, watching the peasants and merchants walk past.  
They spared him nary a glance, well used to the presence of holy men and 
women in their poor corner of town.  When three travelers dressed in 
brown cloaks did stop in front of him, Kiyoshi knew without any words 
that Haruka, Michiru, and young Princess Serenity had arrived.  They 
said nothing as they retreated into an abandoned building, Haruka only 
pushing the hood off her head when they were completely alone.  &quot;Ready 
to go, Kiyoshi-kun?&quot;
 
&quot;Always, old friend.  I knew a few of the servants in the palace from 
the queen&#39;s visit to Ten&#39;ousei, though that was a long time ago, and 
they are waiting to deliver the messages to the princesses when they 
arrive.  They&#39;re also going to keep the queen busy in case she senses 
something amiss or spots one of the four senshi.  Take us to Earth.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled Michiru into her arms, wrapped one arm around the young 
Moon Princess, and let Kiyoshi grab her lover&#39;s delicate hand.  With her 
free hand, Haruka curled her fingers around her henshin stick and 
concentrated.  &quot;Powers of the Senshi before me,&quot; she whispered, &quot;take me 
to Earth, where no rules govern our actions and where love may flourish 
unhindered.  Mother, take me to the one place you would not travel.&quot;  In 
the back of her mind, the princess heard her mother laugh as wind 
surrounded the tiny group and they vanished without a sound.
 
They appeared in the garden on Earth where Serenity and Endymion always 
met.  The prince, shocked, stood up from his contemplations and stared 
at the Moon Princess.  &quot;Serenity,&quot; he gasped.  &quot;You&#39;ve returned to me.&quot;
 
The golden-haired girl jumped into her boyfriend&#39;s arms and let him hold 
her, content to be together again.  Haruka felt Michiru&#39;s hand slip into 
hers and she smiled.  Like the Earth prince and Moon princess, they were 
sacrificing tradition and laws for the sake of love and destiny.  She 
prayed that it would be enough.
 
A tall pillar of flame wound with a golden heart chain announced the 
arrival of the Senshi of Fire and Love, and, a moment later, water and 
leaves brought Ami and Makoto.  The four princesses, clothed in dresses 
that accented their personal color and personality, turned to face 
Michiru and Haruka.  Minako wore a stunning golden dress that shone in 
the light from the sun with a slit in the side almost too high to be 
indecent, while her best friend and partner wore red accented with the 
gold and orange of flame with a shorter slit.  Ami wore a long, loose 
dress bearing the many colors of calm water while Makoto wore various 
shades of green.  Michiru, of course, was wearing a beautiful pale blue 
dress hemmed in light violet, and Haruka wore her pale green and gold 
suit.
 
&quot;Haruka-kun!&quot; Makoto exclaimed.  &quot;You&#39;re marrying Michiru-san?&quot;
 
&quot;I am, Makoto-san, though I did not reveal my true identity to anyone I 
visited.  Ami-chan, Mako-chan, Rei-chan, Minako-chan; my true name is 
Ten&#39;ou Haruka, and I am not a man but a woman, sole daughter of the king 
of Ten&#39;ousei.  I ran away from my home a while ago in order to discover 
the truth of our Senshi powers and to meet my partners.  And I have.&quot;
 
&quot;You can&#39;t be Ten&#39;ou Haruka,&quot; Ami whispered.  &quot;You can&#39;t.&quot;
 
&quot;Remember when that servant saw Ten&#39;ou Kazeko in the control room that 
night?  What did he say that he saw?&quot;
 
&quot;The Space Sword and Sailor Uranus&#39;s henshin stick,&quot; Makoto answered, 
eyes wide.  Haruka opened her hand, and the dark blue and yellow stick 
that only Sailor Uranus could wield lay there, sparkling in the sun.  
Makoto&#39;s eyes flew to the sword at the senshi&#39;s hip, and Haruka drew it.
 
&quot;The Space Sword,&quot; Rei whispered.  &quot;Moons of Mars!  You are her!  Then 
how can you marry Michiru-san?  It&#39;s against the law for two noble women 
to marry!&quot;
 
&quot;Not on Earth.&quot;
 
They got it.  The princesses stared at their equal, their partner, and 
they finally realized what was going on.  &quot;You told us that love is a 
fragile flower that should be allowed to grow,&quot; Minako whispered.
 
&quot;You told me that there is not time enough in one life to live as your 
father and you would wish,&quot; Ami added.  &quot;You told me not to forget my 
dream.  You knew, and you came to us to help us.  You found out why the 
Senshi make such a wonderful team, and you have continued the tradition.  
You will marry her, and there is no one here who would stop you.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s nice to know, Ami-chan,&quot; Haruka whispered.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;
 
In the warm, friendly silence that followed, Kiyoshi cleared his throat.  
&quot;My friend, it&#39;s time to begin.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Setsuna&#39;s eyelids fluttered.  In the midst of her meditations, when all 
of her considerable will should be bent on the truth of the future, 
something had disturbed her.  Reaching for her staff, the Guardian of 
Time and Space stared into her Garnet Orb.  &quot;No,&quot; she whispered.  
&quot;Haruka, you can&#39;t do such a thing!  Love may allow it but Destiny will 
punish you!  Haruka!&quot;
 
She disappeared in a white flash, henshin stick taking her to Earth, 
though she feared that she would be far too late.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka bent down to kiss her Michiru, her wife, and the paired senshi 
cheered.  Though they might never find the courage to repeat the actions 
of the princesses of Kaiousei and Ten&#39;ousei, the four senshi, the Moon 
Princess, and the Earth Prince celebrated the holy bond Ten&#39;ou Haruka 
and Kaiou Michiru now shared.
 
A thunderclap signaled the arrival of another senshi, one not invited 
for a very good reason.  Tall and proud, powerful in her sailor fuku and 
staff, the green-haired Queen of Meiousei glared at the young couple.  
Makoto pulled Ami behind Haruka and Michiru, trusting in the leader of 
the Outer Senshi to protect them.  Rei pulled Minako behind the couple 
as Prince Endymion followed their lead.  Haruka and Michiru faced 
Setsuna, unafraid.  &quot;Haruka-san, why would you do such a thing?  There 
are reasons that laws exist to keep senshi apart.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re the one that sent me out into the Silver Millennium so I could 
discover myself.  I did, and I found Michiru, as well.  I&#39;m happier than 
I&#39;ve ever been, and I have you to thank for it.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka-san, you must not be with Michiru-san.  Outer Senshi aren&#39;t even 
supposed to leave their palaces for long periods of time and we do not 
interact with each other very much.  There will be a price for this, my 
friend.&quot;
 
Haruka hung her head, Michiru wrapped securely in her arms.  &quot;I know.  
But we are not afraid of the future.  I can endure anything as long as 
we are together.&quot;
 
Setsuna held out her staff, Garnet Orb pointing at Haruka and Michiru.  
&quot;I will not allow you to destroy our world for a love you will not 
sacrifice for the sake of the future of your kingdoms.&quot;
 
Haruka pulled her henshin stick out and held it up, glaring at Setsuna.  
Makoto slowly pulled out her stick, Ami following her lead.  Rei and 
Minako also flashed their henshin sticks as they dared the Queen of 
Pluto to fight them.  Slowly, as if afraid of the others&#39; reactions, 
Kaiou Michiru reached into her dress and pulled out a turquoise stick 
topped by a yellow star.  &quot;Mother wasn&#39;t using it,&quot; she explained 
sheepishly.  &quot;I wanted to protect you if something happened.&quot;
 
Haruka nodded as she held up her stick.  &quot;Min&#39;na, henshin yo!&quot;
 
&quot;MARS PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;MERCURY PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;VENUS PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;JUPITER PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;URANUS PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;NEPTUNE PLANET POWER&#151;&quot;
 
&quot;MAKE UP!!!&quot;
 
As one, the six senshi transformed, standing in a line before Meiou 
Setsuna.  &quot;Sailor Pluto, we have no quarrel with you,&quot; Uranus began, 
&quot;but I will not have you interfering with my wedding.  Michiru and I are 
legally bound by the laws of the Silver Millennium, and you cannot 
change that.  No matter what.&quot;  Haruka touched the sword on her hip, and 
Pluto slowly lowered her staff.
 
&quot;I do not approve and I can see nothing but pain and sorrow in the 
future for you two.  You will die for your love and you would not have 
died, else.&quot;  Her eyes softened, just a bit, as she looked at the senshi 
standing in front of her.  Haruka, with her blonde hair cut short and 
her arms crossed defiantly, Space Sword on her waist, looked so much 
like her mother.  &quot;You remind me of Kazeko and Shousha.  They were in 
love as you are in love, but they had the sense to forsake each other 
for the sake of their respective kingdoms.&quot;
 
&#145;Not really, Setsu-chan.&#39;
 
&quot;Kazeko-chan!&quot;
 
The sword glowed for a moment, and a transparent woman with 
shoulder-length blonde hair&#151;braided to keep it out of her way&#151;and 
dressed in the fuku of Sailor Uranus appeared in front of her daughter.  
&#145;Hello, Setsu-chan.  We did not&#151;we could not&#151;sacrifice our love back 
then.  But Shousha had a vision of our precious Moon Kingdom in ruins, 
and I had to prevent that future from occurring.  So I married Koshu, as 
my mother wished.  Shousha didn&#39;t speak to me for so long, but 
eventually she forgave me for leaving her for a man I really didn&#39;t 
love.  She also married, and we became queens of our planets, though we 
never forgot each other.  For the longest time, we&#39;d visit each other 
every so often and we would not sleep alone.  But that hidden, shadowy 
love was all we had left, all we would permit ourselves.  The day she 
lost her son, I was there to comfort her and our storm filled the skies.  
Not long after, the next day, I discovered that I was pregnant with 
Koshu&#39;s daughter.  You, Haruka.  Shousha was so angry, because she knew 
that a daughter meant that I was moving on, away from her and the nights 
we stole together.  She didn&#39;t speak to me until the day I went into 
labor.&#39;
 
&quot;The day you died.&quot;  Pluto hung her head.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, Kazeko.  We all 
knew how much you and Shousha loved each other, and we watched her hold 
your hand as Haruka was born at last.  She promised to hate your 
daughter for killing you, and we finally realized what you two had given 
up.  The rest of us had been close, but the love of Outers is forbidden 
and you had to overcome more to be together.  We really didn&#39;t 
understand.&quot;
 
&#145;As you do not understand my daughter.&#39;  Kazeko tipped her head, arms 
crossed.  &#145;They love each other more than I could have ever loved 
Shousha, because they are willing to sacrifice more.  You and I both 
know that the law separating the Outers exists for a reason, but they 
are still young.  Let them live, Setsu-chan.  They love each other and I 
don&#39;t want them to end up like me and Shousha.  You, of all people, 
understand the love two senshi can share, the forbidden love that has 
sustained you and our queen for so long.&#39;
 
Pluto reached out and took Kazeko&#39;s transparent hand.  &quot;Very well.  I 
will let destiny steer her own course for now.  I will see you again 
when the world ends.&quot;
 
Kazeko chuckled.  &#145;Yes, my friend.  We will meet then.  And I will see 
Shousha again.&#39;  The former Sailor for the planet Uranus turned to her 
daughter and bowed her head.  &#145;Best of luck, my Haruka.  And to you, 
Michiru.  Do not make your mothers&#39; mistake.&#39;
 
&quot;I won&#39;t, Mother.&quot;  Kazeko&#39;s ghost vanished, and Setsuna was left facing 
the lovers again.
 
&quot;Good luck, then.  I will see you at the end, if not sooner.  I will not 
tell your fathers and mothers, either, Sailor Senshi.  The future really 
does belong to you, though you may have to put up with me for a little 
while longer.&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s not a chore, Setsuna-san.&quot;  Haruka bowed her head as Sailor Pluto 
vanished, returning to her planet and her meditations.  The senshi 
detransformed and looked at each other, wondering what to do next.  
Haruka smiled at the four Inner Senshi as she took Michiru&#39;s hand.  &quot;We 
probably should return to the Moon now and our own homes.  Remember, my 
friends, we have a long time until we need heirs for our kingdoms.  Our 
parents can wait; we cannot.&quot;
 
The four nodded, smiling at Haruka.</pre>
