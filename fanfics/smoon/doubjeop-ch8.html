Minako looked grim as she watched her &#39;computer simulation&#39; of Ami and 
Makoto. She had booted up The Sims on her computer and had built 
Makoto&#39;s apartment in as much detail as the game allowed and made Ami, a 
female Virgo, and Makoto, a female Sagittarius, then put them in the 
house. The results were less than promising.

Minako had already had them both die during an earlier simulation when 
Makoto had tried to cook something on the stove, causing a fire. Now 
that she had at least managed to keep them alive longer than five 
minutes, she watched in dismay as the two got into an argument, and then 
a fight.

When her phone rang, she was glad for the diversion, though she still 
sounded glum as she answered it. &quot;Hello . . . Oh, hi, Rei. Any luck with 
the sacred fire?&quot; Minako scrunched up her face at the other&#39;s answer. 
&quot;That bad, huh? I suppose there is always the chance you&#39;re wrong . . . 
yeah . . . yeah . . . Well, my exacting simulation results are . . . 
well, slightly better than your reading, I think.&quot;

&quot;Yeah yeah, I know. It sucks that Mako-chan has to work today. We only 
have til this evening to make certain this will work . . . You&#39;re still 
going to meet her after she gets off, right? Cool . . . Yeah I know, no 
pressure.&quot;

Rei chattered to Minako again for a moment then she said, &quot;Yeah . . . 
She&#39;s still having problems with her dreams. She calls them night 
terrors.&quot; Minako shuddered at the memory of Ami&#39;s terrified screaming 
the night before. &quot;I feel sorry for her, but at the same time, makes it 
hard to sleep some nights, ya know? I hope it doesn&#39;t affect things 
tonight.&quot;

Then Minako&#39;s expression changed to one of shock then amusement as Rei 
said something to her over the phone for a while. &quot;Wow . . . yeah . . . 
Oh my gosh . . . No . . . Bwahaha! . . . Ha ha ha! . . . She didn&#39;t . . 
. Oh my lord . . . Well that one was creative . . . I knew I should have 
stayed in there a little longer when she was trying to shoo me out . . . 
Yeah I know! Wonder if that last one will hurt her back, right?&quot;

Then she looked serious as she watched her digital Ami slap digital 
Makoto. &quot;Sad thing is, if we screw this up again tonight, they won&#39;t get 
the chance to find out, will they? Well, I&#39;m going to go for now . . . 
yep . . . yep . . . later,&quot; then she hung up.

Holding her head up with one hand as she watched digital Makoto scream 
at digital Ami for using the shower while she wanted to, Minako thought 
about her job in what her and Rei were calling Operation Thunder Snow 
Take Two. She had it pretty easy. First, while Ami worked on the test 
papers she still needed to grade, Minako had to pick out flowers for the 
two of them to give each other on their date. Since Ami was busy trying 
to get some of her work done for her lessons, she had told Minako it was 
OK for her to choose. Makoto would have picked out the ones to give to 
Ami herself, but as mentioned above, she had to work. Besides, this was 
the part that Minako had to pay for anyway. If she was lucky she would 
find two bouquets that looked fabulous, and just happened to be on the 
cheaper side. If she couldn&#39;t find anything cheap though, she was 
willing to spend a bit of money to make sure at least her end of the 
deal came through, if nothing else.

After that, she and Ami were going to go shopping for a dress for Ami. 
Ami bought new clothing far less than the rest of them did, so this 
would be fun. It&#39;d be like playing dress up with a little kid, only with 
higher stakes, and a woman who, in Minako&#39;s mind at least, didn&#39;t always 
have the best fashion sense. It wasn&#39;t that Ami&#39;s taste in clothing was 
ugly to Minako. It was just . . . kinda boring. She tended to buy fairly 
conservative clothing that would last a long time instead of something a 
little more . . . showy.

Then came the really hard part -- getting Ami into a hair salon to do 
something special with her hair. Ami had worn her hair virtually the 
same since the first day any of them had known her. She didn&#39;t even do 
something special with it for Usagi&#39;s wedding, even though she had been 
the maid of honor. That part was going to be like pulling teeth. Minako 
still wasn&#39;t sure how she was going to get Ami to go through with it.

----------

Hotaru selected a wrench out of the tool box and handed it down to 
Haruka as she slid back under the car. She spoke rapidly to Haruka, 
trying to sort things out. &quot;I just don&#39;t get it, Haruka Papa. They love 
each other a lot. Ami should have fallen right into Makoto&#39;s arms 
without a second thought when she talked to her Thursday. Instead, she 
pretty much dumped her long-time unrequited love when she finally tells 
her, for a person online. Sure, it&#39;s still Makoto and Ami doesn&#39;t know 
it . . . but why did she do that? I mean, Ami loves Makoto. I&#39;m even 
more confused now that you told me she told Michiru Mama more than three 
years ago. And why won&#39;t Makoto just go over and say, &#39;Hey! Its me!&#39; 
Wouldn&#39;t that make things easier? I just figure . . . I just don&#39;t get 
it,&quot; she finished with a huff of frustration.

Haruka made an adjustment and said from under the car, &quot;Neither do I, 
but it doesn&#39;t bother me. Hotaru, love between two people is 
complicated, especially for people like Ami and Makoto. Ami is an 
incredibly intelligent person, yet under the surface she has a 
surprising amount of emotion even if she doesn&#39;t always show or act on 
it. Makoto is tough on the outside because she had to be for so long 
after her parents died. On the inside, though, she is perhaps more 
delicate than Ami. Throw the fact that Ami has recently been put on an 
emotional roller coaster, and it shouldn&#39;t surprise any of us that she 
isn&#39;t able to think straight, and is taking poor Makoto on one twisty 
ride.&quot; Then Haruka said, &quot;Hand me the pliers, will ya?&quot;

Her daughter did as she was told, then Haruka continued. &quot;The reason we 
are going to try to help them get together is because their both 
stubborn individuals when they want to be. Sometimes people just need a 
little . . . &quot; She stopped speaking for a moment as she strained while 
twisting a particularly tight bolt before finishing, &quot; . . . push in the 
right direction. Understand?&quot;

Hotaru looked down at her Papa as she slid out from under the car and 
answered, &quot;No.&quot;

As Haruka wiped her hands off with a rag and stood up she said, &quot;Then we 
are on the same page. At some point you just gotta understand that you 
won&#39;t ever understand why people do some of the things they do. And 
people can be even more confusing when they are in love. Remind me to 
tell you about how me and your Michiru Mama got together sometime.&quot; 
Looking back at the car, she said, &quot;Well that&#39;s that. Guess you get to 
go help Michiru Mama pick out a dress for tonight.&quot;

Then Haruka headed to the piano to practice a song Minako had 
recommended. The blonde didn&#39;t even give Haruka sheet music to go by, 
just a recording of the song and asked Haruka to learn it in about a 
day. It was in English, so she didn&#39;t understand most of it. However, 
she had been assured that Ami would recognize the song as soon as Haruka 
started to play it.

----------

Rei said angrily to Makoto as the taller woman tried to jerk her head 
away again, &quot;If you would hold still it wouldn&#39;t hurt so much!&quot;

The Senshi of fire was helping Makoto get ready for her date. Since they 
had to start later in the day, they wouldn&#39;t have time to go out and get 
her hair done or buy a new dress like Ami. They would have to make do 
with what they had on hand at Makoto&#39;s apartment. The two were 
surrounded by brushes, combs, a curling iron, a few boxes of hair clips, 
and two blow-dryers in Makoto&#39;s bedroom as Rei worked. Rei was getting 
frustrated with Makoto&#39;s hair because it wouldn&#39;t do what she wanted it 
to, thus causing her to lose her temper and use angry yanking motions 
occasionally to vent some frustration. Of course, this earned Rei an 
earful from Makoto every time she did that, which in Rei&#39;s mind was just 
making the process longer.

&quot;How can I hold still when you keep ripping my hair out?!&quot; Makoto yelled 
back angrily.

&quot;Two or three more yanks and I&#39;ll be done, so just tolerate it!&quot;

Rei quietly finished brushing Makoto&#39;s hair without interruption from 
Makoto, though the latter gritted her teeth a few times as Rei, true to 
her word, gave a few more yanks on another knot. Then Rei quickly put 
Makoto&#39;s hair in a simple braided ponytail. The look was simple, and 
because Makoto usually wore her hair unbraided it made her look almost 
like a different person to Rei. &quot;Well, on the plus side, once we put 
some makeup on you, she may actually believe you to be a different 
person at first.&quot; said Rei as she held up the mirror. She hoped Makoto 
liked the style, because it was their fifth attempt at a different style 
and Makoto seemed like she was about to run screaming whenever Rei 
picked up a brush at this point.

Makoto, for her part, turned her head from side to side, watching the 
new tightly woven ponytail sway back and forth as she did. It was a bit 
longer than she thought it would be. Sounding a little uncertain, she 
said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, you don&#39;t think its too . . . simple do you?&quot;

Rei felt her eyebrow twitch involuntarily at the comment as a feeling of 
frustration with the brunette pulsed through her blood. &quot;At this point, 
I would have thought you would feel simple was a good thing! Don&#39;t tell 
me you want to try the curls again!&quot; Makoto had originally wanted her 
hair curled, and had suggested a style that was too complex for Rei&#39;s 
abilities. The Miko had gone so overboard with curling Makoto&#39;s hair 
that when she had finished Makoto&#39;s hair looked like a perfect sphere of 
curls, kinda like a clown with brown hair.

Makoto held up her hands as if defending herself from Rei. &quot;No! Anything 
but the curls! This&#39;ll work for me!&quot; Then, a little worried again, she 
said, &quot;I just want Ami to like it, I guess. I&#39;m just nervous, Rei. I 
think I&#39;d have been less nervous at this point not knowing the woman I 
was dating was Ami. I&#39;ve wanted her for so long . . . You think we&#39;re 
doing the right thing?&quot;

Rei said, with a reassuring smile on her face, &quot;We wouldn&#39;t be trying to 
help you if we didn&#39;t.&quot;

Makoto quietly looked at the picture of her parents for a moment. She 
kept the picture on her nightstand. &quot;It&#39;s been so long since I saw them 
that I don&#39;t remember their voices anymore. I honestly don&#39;t even know 
how they would feel about me doing this, Rei. I like to think that 
compared to some of the men I&#39;ve dated over the years, they would see 
Ami as a diamond in the rough. It&#39;s silly to think about them at a time 
like this, but I wonder if they would be proud of me, or . . . 
embarrassed.&quot;

Rei watched Makoto sadly for awhile as thoughts of her own mother went 
through her mind. Rei had often wondered at times like graduations, or 
when they had accomplished something as Sailor Senshi, or even on little 
things like when she passed a hard test, or learned to drive, what her 
mother would have said. It pained her to know that she would never know 
and somehow hurt just a little more to know that Makoto understood that 
feeling even more than she herself did.

Putting a hand on the tall woman&#39;s shoulder she said quietly, both to 
herself and to Makoto, &quot;For what it&#39;s worth, I think they would have 
been proud of you.&quot;

Makoto looked at the picture a moment more, then said quietly, holding 
back tears, &quot;Thanks, Rei.&quot;

Losing her parents at such a young age was something Makoto still cried 
about, usually when no one was around. She felt it was both silly and 
pathetic that after twenty years it still hurt as much as it did, and 
occasionally got mad at herself for what she perceived as weakness. Rei 
was the only one of her friends she talked about it with and it somehow 
helped her to know Rei felt the same way about her mother.

Taking a breath to clear her mind, Makoto perked up a bit and said 
excitedly, &quot;OK. Time to pick out a dress!&quot; She jumped up and practically 
ran the short distance to her closet, throwing open the doors once she 
reached it. Granted, Makoto didn&#39;t dress like a guy as Haruka did, but 
as Rei looked at the array of dresses within the closet it surprised her 
that a tomboy like Makoto would have so many. She seemed to have more 
styles than a department store and more colors than the rainbow. Indeed, 
a rainbow was what they looked like since Makoto had them arranged by 
color. No wonder she wasn&#39;t disappointed about not having to buy one, 
she still had ones in her closet she hadn&#39;t worn other than to try on! 
Half of them still had the tags on them, for Pete&#39;s sake!

Rei said quietly, still in awe of the sight, &quot;How about something 
white?&quot;

Makoto then pushed several of the dresses aside to reveal the white 
dresses to which Makoto said only half jokingly, &quot;Bright white, or off 
white?&quot; She then pulled out ten different dresses that Rei assumed were 
her favorites of the bunch.

This was going to take even longer than her hair, was Rei&#39;s thought. She 
hoped the makeup portion of this adventure would be short, otherwise 
they were going to be late for sure!
Ami had won her argument with Minako earlier in the day about which 
dress to wear. She had told Cherrypielover that she was going to wear 
the same dress she had worn during the concert so she would be able to 
see it. However, she had lost the argument over her hair. She had been 
dragged, nearly kicking and screaming, into the salon and was forced for 
the first time since she had hair to wear it differently. Surprisingly, 
Ami liked what they had done with it.

The stylist took pity on Ami and listened to her instead of Minako who 
had made several suggestions that Ami had felt were . . . extreme. All 
she did was add silver highlights to her hair, curled her bangs a 
little, and added blue glitter to make her stand out a bit more. Ami 
felt the silver highlights made her look a little older than her usual 
appearance, which was fine since she didn&#39;t want Cherry to think she had 
lied about her age. She also hoped the glitter, which had been the only 
suggestion of Minako&#39;s to make it into her appearance for the evening, 
made her look a little more fun loving.

She was now walking down the street to the C&#39;zon Ebisu with Haruka, who 
was wearing a nice black tux, and Michiru, who was wearing a simple 
evening gown that matched her aqua colored hair. Once they reached it, 
she asked shyly, &quot;Do you think she&#39;ll show up?&quot;

Haruka nearly laughed. &quot;You betcha. Why, we spoke to her last night, as 
a matter of fact. She is so excited I bet she is already here.&quot; Then 
Haruka and Michiru both looked in through a window in the front of the 
building to find Makoto.

After a few moments Ami asked nervously, &quot;Do you see her?&quot;

Just as she finished saying that, Haruka grabbed Michiru&#39;s arm gently, 
and said, pointing with her other hand, &quot;Oh! There she is . . . wow . . 
. check out those legs, Michiru.&quot;

Michiru smiled slightly then moved closer to Haruka so that Ami couldn&#39;t 
see through the window, saying, &quot;And what about the way that dress 
accents every curve of her body, Haruka? Why, I&#39;m liable to sleep with 
her myself.&quot;

Makoto was sitting at a table within view of the window. Michiru nearly 
laughed when she saw a waiter bring her a small glass of wine, which the 
nervous Makoto downed in one gulp, coughing presumably delicately into 
one of her hands after swallowing it. Michiru couldn&#39;t help but think 
that the poor dear must be a nervous wreck.

For once, Haruka got to say it. &quot;Only place you&#39;ll be sleeping if you 
make a comment like that again is the couch, sweetheart.&quot; Then, with an 
even bigger smile, she said, &quot;Check out that bust! I envy you, Ami.&quot;

Ami, for her part, was standing behind the two blushing profusely, but 
still asked, &quot;Can you move over so I can see?&quot;

Haruka said teasingly, as she pushed Ami away with one hand without 
taking her eyes away from the window, &quot;No way! Get your own window.&quot;

Michiru said, &quot;Come on, Ruka. Let&#39;s introduce Ami to her date.&quot; Then 
they both turned around and each grabbed one of Ami&#39;s shoulders, moving 
her away from the window so that she couldn&#39;t see, and continued toward 
the front door.

Ami stopped, standing right in the doorway, and said out loud, suddenly 
sounding scared, &quot;I can&#39;t do this.&quot;

Haruka actually felt her temper rise a bit at those words. Then she 
remembered her own words to Hotaru earlier that day. Out loud she said, 
&quot;Sorry Ami, but for your own good, you&#39;re going through with this. The 
woman you&#39;re meeting happens to be a good friend of mine and I won&#39;t 
have you breaking her heart tonight. You&#39;re going to walk in there,&quot; 
Haruka pushed Ami, forcing the short woman to have to walk forward or be 
pushed over, &quot;you&#39;re going to have a wonderful evening, and you can 
thank us later.&quot;

Ami dug her heels in the ground a bit, making a quiet screeching sound 
as Haruka pushed her forward. &quot;No, you don&#39;t understand! I . . . I 
can&#39;t!&quot;

Michiru put a hand on Haruka&#39;s shoulder to silently tell her to stop for 
a moment. &quot;Why not?&quot; she asked simply.

Ami stuttered for a moment, trying to think how to put to words what she 
was thinking in her brain. &quot;Ma . . . Makoto. I was terrible to her. I 
know it would be mean and unfair to Cherry to back out now, but I . . .&quot;

Haruka cut her off, but didn&#39;t sound angry. &quot;OK, Ami, I&#39;ll tell you 
what. You go through with this and give &#39;Cherry&#39; a chance. If you don&#39;t 
like her afterward, I&#39;ll let her down easy for you and you can pursue 
Makoto with a clean conscience. That way everyone wins, all right?&quot;

Ami thought about taking the moment to try to run out the door, but 
noticed Michiru was standing so she would have to knock her down to do 
that. Realizing the two of them were not going to back down from this, 
Ami sighed quietly, &quot;All right.&quot;

Haruka checked them in, then she and her lover showed Ami to their seat. 
The restaurant was spacious, with tables arranged around a dance floor 
and a large grand piano off to the side. Ami&#39;s had a white rose waiting 
for her, but there was no sign of her date. She sat down quietly, 
thinking maybe the woman had gotten cold feet and left at the last 
moment. That would make her life a little easier, even if it meant she 
had wasted three months of her life talking to her online.

Haruka said as Ami sat down, &quot;Huh. Guess she needed to take a moment to 
put on some makeup or something.&quot; Ami didn&#39;t know it, but this was 
actually part of the plan.

Michiru sat down opposite of Ami and said, &quot;Haruka, why don&#39;t you go 
play a song on the piano over there while we wait for Ami&#39;s date to get 
back?&quot;

Haruka said, sounding as if it were something she had rehearsed so many 
times she was sick of repeating it, &quot;That&#39;s a great idea, Michiru.&quot;

Ami noticed the tone in Haruka&#39;s voice and realized they were hiding 
something. As she twirled the bouquet of blue lilies she had brought for 
her date nervously in her hands, she said, barely above a whisper, as 
Haruka sat down behind the piano, &quot;What are you two up to?&quot;

Michiru heard Ami&#39;s rhetorical question and said with a smile on her 
face, &quot;Oh, nothing at all, Ami. You&#39;re so suspicious all the time. Just 
relax a bit and enjoy the music, won&#39;t you?&quot;

Haruka quietly tapped the pianist&#39;s shoulder and asked if she could 
borrow the piano for a moment. Ami didn&#39;t know it, but the pianist who 
worked here was a friend of Haruka&#39;s. Once Haruka sat down at the piano 
and started playing, Ami recognized the melody after only a few notes. 
It was a song that Minako had on CD, only set to a slower more romantic 
speed and tone by the talented Haruka. It was an American song Ami was 
particularly fond of because it reminded her of Makoto every time she 
heard it. As the opening stanza was played, Michiru got up and walked 
over to Haruka and pulled out her violin which had been hidden behind 
the piano playing her parts to the tune. As the song got to the part 
with singing, Ami couldn&#39;t figure out how they knew about the song to 
begin with, but decided to just enjoy the moment and sung along to 
herself in English with a thick Japanese accent. She couldn&#39;t speak 
English as good as Minako. German was her specialty in foreign 
languages. But she understood and knew how to speak enough words to sing 
part of Train&#39;s Drops of Jupiter.

She stopped singing abruptly, when she noticed a tall woman with 
brownish red hair tied in a beautiful yet simple ponytail and an elegant 
white dress with a seductive slit up the right leg, seeming to glide 
toward her from across the room like an angel. There was something 
familiar about her, but at first Ami couldn&#39;t place it because she was 
so mesmerized by the other woman&#39;s beauty. She had the most beautiful 
green eyes Ami had ever seen. Ami watched as the tall woman sat down 
next to her, and felt her heart racing and pounding against her ribs. 
She had been expecting someone else to the point that she actually 
didn&#39;t recognize Makoto . . . until she spoke.

Putting her hands over Ami&#39;s, which still griped the bouquet of lilies 
meant for her date, Makoto said quietly, &quot;PBJ. . . Now I know what that 
stands for. I thought it was your initials for a long time. But it 
stands for Peanut Butter and Jelly, am I right?&quot;

Ami was so surprised to hear Makoto&#39;s voice, and her eyes showed it. She 
blinked a few times, feeling Makoto&#39;s surprisingly soft hands on hers, 
not comprehending for a moment that the other woman had spoken. She said 
dumbly, &quot;Makoto? Cherry? You&#39;re Cherrypielover?&quot; At first Ami was too 
surprised to feel anything. Then she said with just the slightest edge 
of anger in her voice, &quot;You . . . all tricked me. How many of you are in 
on this?&quot;

She didn&#39;t get up, which, at this point, Makoto took as a good sign 
since she hadn&#39;t expected Ami to even waste a single word once she 
realized what was going on. Trying to stay confident, Makoto said, &quot;I 
tried to tell you at the concert. I realized it once you stopped 
chatting with me, and once I saw you in the lobby, I . . . well you know 
the rest. Just . . . give me a chance this time, OK? That&#39;s all I want. 
One chance, then even if you turn me down cold after that,&quot; Makoto 
smiled a bit, &quot;I can be happy.&quot;

Ami looked at Makoto as the other woman looked down at the table with a 
defeated look on her face and realized just how cruel she had been. So 
cruel that she didn&#39;t expect a shred of a chance. Ami put the lilies on 
the table and held Makoto&#39;s hands gently, then said, echoing the words 
she had said nearly fourteen years ago, &quot;You don&#39;t look so cheerful, 
Mako-chan.&quot;

Makoto looked at Ami for a moment, astonished to see the smaller woman 
had a happy smile on her face. She responded with a memory of a moment 
that was faded like an old photograph, rough around the edges from being 
handled so many times. &quot;Oh? When you&#39;re tall like me, nobody asks you 
for a dance.&quot;

Ami squeezed Makoto&#39;s hands gently, then said confidently, &quot;Can I ask 
you for a dance?&quot;

Makoto, rising to her feet and gently pulling Ami to hers, said happily 
yet simply, &quot;Sure.&quot; and led the small bluenette to the dance floor as 
Haruka and Michiru continued to play their music as the two danced for 
the first time in over a decade, and for the first time being honest 
with each other about their true feelings.

The two danced for what seemed like hours, as if they were little bits 
of confetti flying and twirling around the dance floor. In reality they 
had only danced for three songs before making their way back to there 
table. Haruka and Michiru were already sitting there by this time. 
Haruka had handed the piano back to the restaurant&#39;s usual pianist at 
the end of the first song to dance with Michiru for a song, then they 
decided to watch from their table while the other two danced. Haruka was 
too busy looking at the menu and hoping she had remembered to bring her 
credit card to notice that Ami and Makoto had returned.

Michiru said politely, &quot;Welcome back. You two look good together . . . 
right Ruka?&quot; she said, elbowing Haruka in the ribs to get her to stop 
looking at the menu with a mortified expression and acknowledge their 
friends&#39; return.

Haruka put down the menu then put a hand on the back of her head, a 
little embarrassed, saying, &quot;Oh yeah! Two peas in a pod, those two.&quot; 
Then, to Michiru, she said quietly, &quot;Uh . . . You were planning on 
eating light, right?&quot; Then so quietly it was almost inaudible, &quot;Thank 
god we didn&#39;t bring Usagi.&quot;

As Haruka and Michiru decided what they were going to order, Ami and 
Makoto had quietly sat down and started looking at the menu themselves. 
Makoto was instantly glad Usagi and Mamoru were paying for dinner when 
she looked at the prices. Even still, Makoto was too busy suffering from 
sticker shock to notice that Ami had edged closer to her in the booth 
while looking at their menus until she felt Ami&#39;s hip gently touch hers. 
Makoto looked at Ami casually to see her expression. Ami was just 
reading her menu innocently. Makoto found it amusing that now that Ami 
suddenly didn&#39;t have to hide her feelings, she was just as big a tease 
in person as she was online.

Once their waiter came and got their orders, Michiru said quietly, &quot;I&#39;m 
going to head to the ladies&#39; room to check my makeup. Care to join me, 
Ami?&quot;

Ami looked quietly at Makoto for a moment, then nodded to Michiru and 
the two walked off.

&quot;It&#39;s dangerous letting the two of them go off alone like that, you 
know,&quot; said Haruka to Makoto as she watched the two enter the women&#39;s 
restroom. &quot;They&#39;re going to compare us to each other and wind up 
discussing stuff they don&#39;t want us to hear.&quot; Then she sighed quietly, 
ending her gripe with, &quot;I hate it when she does this.&quot;

Makoto smiled at Haruka and said &quot;What&#39;s the matter? Scared you won&#39;t 
measure up?&quot;

Haruka said, &quot;To you? Nah! It&#39;s just . . . &quot; She stopped talking when 
Michiru came back to the table and whispered something to Makoto. Then 
she sat down calmly next to Haruka while Makoto got up and headed to the 
ladies room, trying not to look like she was in a hurry.

Haruka looked over at Michiru, raising an eyebrow with a look that said, 
All right, now what?

Michiru explained to Haruka, &quot;It&#39;s Ami. We walked in and had just 
started talking when she looked at the mirror and just froze. At first I 
thought it was something I said, but when she didn&#39;t move I decided to 
send Makoto in to talk to her.&quot;

Haruka looked concerned, saying, &quot;Do you think we should help? Or is 
this one of those let them handle it type of things?&quot;

Michiru said quietly, &quot;The latter. I think Ami still has some issues to 
deal with from her abduction. Maybe Makoto can help her.&quot;

Makoto opened the door to the bathroom to see Ami leaning over the 
counter, staring at her reflection in the mirror with an expression that 
was either fear, anger, or both. She walked over to Ami, quietly placing 
a hand on her shoulder, saying, &quot;Hey, you all right?&quot; Ami didn&#39;t answer. 
She just kept staring at the mirror like she was expecting to be 
attacked. Makoto said worriedly as she put the pieces together, &quot;That&#39;s 
why the mirror was broken when they found your impostor in your 
apartment.&quot;

Ami nodded, then said, sounding scared, &quot;She jumped through it. I&#39;m not 
sure how the others got here, but Amy . . . Ever since then . . . I . . 
. haven&#39;t felt safe.&quot; she said quietly, trying not to say what she was 
thinking. &quot;I can handle this on my own.&quot; Makoto couldn&#39;t help but think 
Ami didn&#39;t sound like she meant that.

Still keeping her hand on Ami&#39;s shoulder, Makoto gave it a gentle 
squeeze. &quot;No, Ami. We&#39;re together now. If you have a problem it&#39;s my 
problem. Come on, talk to me.&quot;

Ami laughed, but it was a nervous one with no humor in it. Not taking 
her gaze from her reflection, she said, &quot;It&#39;s silly. I just feel . . . 
like I have to constantly watch my back. Like even when I am with my 
friends, even with you, like I&#39;m in danger. I have nightmares about it, 
did you know that?&quot;

Makoto looked into the eyes of Ami&#39;s reflection until she saw Ami&#39;s 
reflection look back. Then Makoto said quietly, &quot;Yes I know. You don&#39;t 
have to be ashamed of being scared Ami. None of us are holding it 
against you.&quot;

After a few more moments, Makoto put her hands on Ami&#39;s shoulders and 
gently turned her around so she was facing her. Remembering her promise 
to Hana, Makoto said, &quot;We are all behind you Ami. We can help you. I can 
help you. Just give us time.&quot; Then, as she slowly pulled Ami back toward 
the door she said, &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go enjoy the rest of our night. We 
can deal with this later, together.&quot;

Ami quietly followed Makoto out of the room, and the two joined Michiru 
and Haruka back at the table just in time to get their food. Ami looked 
a little embarrassed but with some encouragement from the others at the 
table, she started to enjoy herself again. She wasn&#39;t about to let 
anything ruin the rest of her night.

After dinner and a few more dances, the four decided it was time to part 
ways for the evening. As they walked, Haruka said to Michiru, &quot;Poor 
Makoto. She is going to have her hands full with Ami for a while, I 
think. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Ami. But I&#39;ve said it once and I&#39;ll 
say it again. That woman is on one hell of an emotional roller coaster.&quot;

Michiru shrugged and said, &quot;That may be, but at least Ami won&#39;t be on 
that terrifying ride alone anymore. There have been times when you have 
gone on one of those too, you know. If it weren&#39;t for me, I don&#39;t know 
how you would have gotten through some of them.&quot; Haruka laughed quietly 
in denial as the two headed home.

----------

On their way back to Ami&#39;s apartment, Ami and Makoto decided to go for a 
romantic walk in a park. Granted, this course of action would not 
normally be advisable in a large city in the middle of the night, but 
the two felt that two Senshi could easily deal with a mugger if they ran 
into one. Besides, it would be a shame to waste such a beautiful spring 
night. The temperature was perfect, the sky was clear with a blanket of 
stars, and the moon was full, casting a soft light over Tokyo that 
night.

The two walked silently down the path, holding hands and saying nothing, 
just enjoying the moment. Both were lost in their own thoughts as well. 
When they reached a wooden bridge that went over a small man-made river 
in the park that was full of koi, Ami stopped and looked over a railing 
at the fish. Makoto looked over for a moment too, and noticed the koi 
begging for food, and the moon causing the two of them to look like 
ripply silhouettes on the water. Then after a few moments, Makoto 
watched Ami and noticed the other had a small happy smile on her face.

She had told Ami this before at the concert, but she felt now was a good 
time to say it again. &quot;I love you, Ami.&quot;

Unfortunately for poor Makoto, the response she got was, once again, not 
the one she wanted nor expected.

Ami looked at her with a slight expression of irritation, and said, &quot;No, 
you don&#39;t. You want me, you&#39;re infatuated with me, and you like me, but 
love takes time to develop, Makoto.&quot;

This time, Makoto couldn&#39;t keep the frustration with her blue-eyed 
companion out of her voice. &quot;What? Ever hear of a little thing called 
love at first sight?&quot; She sighed angrily thinking to herself that 
sometimes she wished Ami wasn&#39;t so calculating with everything, even 
with her emotions.

Ami responded, &quot;You have always been quick to fall for anyone who 
resembles your old sempai. What you felt for them can&#39;t have been love 
at first sight and it can&#39;t be what you feel for me now. You&#39;re 
twenty-nine years old now, Makoto. Maybe it&#39;s time you learned the 
difference.&quot;

Makoto said angrily, &quot;What makes you think it can&#39;t be love? Maybe 
you&#39;re wrong and I do know the difference now!&quot;

Now, Ami spoke in a quiet, angry voice. &quot;Because if it were, you would 
have said something fifteen years ago.&quot;

Ami started to say something to Makoto again, but now Makoto wasn&#39;t 
listening. As the blue haired girl continued to lecture her, Makoto 
thought to herself that she was sure of how she felt about Ami. If Ami 
wasn&#39;t going to admit it and needed time to say the words back to her, 
Makoto could wait. So, as the blue haired woman continued on her tirade, 
Makoto said again, not caring whether Ami even heard her this time or 
not, &quot;I love you, Ami.&quot;

Then, as Ami was half way through another sentence in her angry 
frustrated lecture about human emotion and psychology, Makoto pulled her 
close, suddenly covering Ami&#39;s mouth with hers as she gave her short 
companion a long, deep, passionate kiss.

Ami cut off her words with a sudden surprised, &quot;Mmmph!&quot; She went stiff 
for a moment, too surprised to do anything as Makoto continued to kiss 
her. Finally, Ami returned the kiss to Makoto before she could pull 
away, wrapping her arms around the taller woman&#39;s slim waist as the moon 
and the koi continued to be the only ones there to witness their first 
kiss.

Authors note: In Japan, Koi are considered good luck.
