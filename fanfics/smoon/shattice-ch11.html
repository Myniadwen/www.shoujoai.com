<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 11 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>        Keiko led Ami and the others over to the dining table, moving 
with confidence through the crowd. Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was crowded as 
usual, young ladies of various types mingling and talking animatedly all 
around them. The dance floor was packed and a line-up waited patiently 
up by the bar as three bartenders rushed to serve drinks.

        &quot;Wow,&quot; Chibi-Usa murmured softly, looking around her in awe.

        Hotaru walked beside her, the taller black haired girl staying 
protectively close. &quot;I&#39;ll agree with that,&quot; she nodded.

        &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Setsuna smiled down at the two little girls, &quot;the 
Locket is neutral territory, there&#39;s never any fights or trouble here.&quot;

        Ami smiled slightly, her eyes dark as she said, &quot;It&#39;s quite the 
place.&quot;

        Setsuna was about to ask her something when they reached their 
table. Ami held out a seat, and she settled down with a smile, &quot;Thank 
you.&quot;

        &quot;Sorry,&quot; Keiko smiled sheepishly, her brown braid flowing down 
her back, &quot;but we&#39;re really crowded tonight. It&#39;ll be a few moments 
before someone can take your order.&quot; She bowed, &quot;But you will be served 
in a few moments.&quot; With that, she was off.

        Hotaru looked around wide eyed, &quot;There&#39;s a library, too?&quot;

        Ami smiled, &quot;I noticed that, too. A good selection, though some 
of it&#39;s not appropriate for younger readers.&quot;

        &quot;Ah,&quot; Hotaru nodded, &quot;like Haruka-papa and Michiru-mama&#39;s 
books.&quot;

        A long beat of silence, then Setsuna looked down at Hotaru 
thoughtfully. &quot;What sort of books?&quot; she asked curiously.

        &quot;The ones that they keep hidden in the back of their bedside 
dresser,&quot; Hotaru explained to them innocently.

        It looked like Setsuna was doing her best not to laugh aloud and 
Ami was fighting to maintain her straight face. &#39;I&#39;m glad Chibi-Usa 
isn&#39;t jumping in,&#39; Ami mused.

        A tall violet haired woman in a Chinese dress reached them, 
moving through the crowd with confidence. Shampoo beamed at them, the 
busty young woman holding a order pad, &quot;Ohayo! How can I serve you 
tonight?&quot;

        &quot;What&#39;s good for tonight?&quot; Ami asked curiously.

        Shampoo nearly laughed aloud, &quot;Everything is good out of this 
kitchen, Mizuno-san. Would you like our dinner special?&quot;

        Ami looked over at Setsuna and the others, weighing their 
opinions. Setsuna nodded with a smile, both little girls chiming in 
their agreement. &quot;Okay,&quot; Ami turned back to Shampoo to say, &quot;we&#39;ll go 
with the special.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;ll be right back,&quot; Shampoo bounced away, casually slapping 
off random hands as they tried to feel her bottom.

        Setsuna shook her head with a smile, &quot;It looks like she&#39;s still 
working part time here.&quot;

        &quot;Paying off damage from the last fight she got into with Ranma 
and the others,&quot; an amused voice came out of the crowd. A tall, orange 
haired woman stood beside the table, looking down at the four of them 
thoughtfully.

        &quot;Ami,&quot; Setsuna said calmly, &quot;I&#39;d like you to meet Arisugawa 
Juri- san.&quot;

        &quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Ami looked up at her cautiously, feeling mildly 
embassased, &quot;I wanted to apologize for the incident the last time I was 
here.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s been known to happen,&quot; Juri&#39;s voice was gently. She smiled 
at Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, then looked back at Ami and Setsuna, &quot;I thought 
I should warn you that Rei and some of the others are here tonight.&quot;

        Ami paled slightly, then she nodded grimly. &quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna 
said, giving Ami a moment to recover herself.

        &quot;Keiko told me you were coming,&quot; Juri said as she turned to walk 
back towards the bar itself, &quot;it was the least I could do.&quot;

        &quot;She had the oddest look on her face,&quot; Hotaru murmured softly.

        &quot;Juri&#39;s home reality is a different one than ours,&quot; Setsuna 
chose her words carefully, &quot;and in that timeline she and I are a 
couple.&quot;

        Ami recovered from that bombshell pretty fast, smiling at 
Setsuna wryly, &quot;Then Arisugawa has good taste.&quot;

        Setsuna actually blushed slightly at that comment. Before she 
could say anything in reply Shampoo returned to their table, stylishly 
dropped off four fully loaded plates then took off with a cheerful 
bounce.

        &quot;More than one Setsuna?&quot; Hotaru asked Chibi-Usa softly.

        &quot;Puu tried to explain it to me once,&quot; Chini-Usa looked with awe 
at her fully loaded plate, &quot;about every event birthing an infinite 
number of possible futures.&quot; She paused before adding sheepishly, &quot;But I 
fell asleep midway through.&quot;

        &quot;Infinite numbers of all of us,&quot; Hotaru mused. She tilted her 
head to the side, &quot;I&#39;m not sure if I like that idea or not.&quot;

        &quot;Forgot to order drinks,&quot; Ami noted. She smiled, pushing back 
from the table smoothly, &quot;I get some sodas for the girls. Is there 
anything you like?&quot;

        &quot;Sake, actually,&quot; Setsuna frowned slightly, &quot;but do you want me 
to...?&quot;

        Ami smiled down at her wryly and said, &quot;If something does 
happen, you can always come rescue me again.&quot;

        &quot;I doubt you&#39;ll need rescue,&quot; Setsuna murmured, watching her 
stride towards the bar.

        Ami cut through the crowd casually, her black suit soaking up 
the dim light. She recieved a few startled glances, as well as eyes 
tending towards her scar. She ignored it, reaching the bar itself and 
taking in the three women bouncing along the counter to serve the press 
of women.

        &quot;What can I get you?&quot; the black haired woman asked, the blue 
haired twins busy.

        &quot;Two cans of soda, a bottle of sake and a cup as well as...&quot; Ami 
trailed off thoughtfully.

        &quot;If I remember right you take a shot of whiskey,&quot; the blue 
haired woman appeared with a smile, taking in Ami&#39;s scared face. &quot;Good 
to see you, Mizuno-san,&quot; the woman smiled.

        &quot;Have we met?&quot; Ami raised an eyebrow in question.

        &quot;Ryouko,&quot; the blue haired woman flipped her long mane of hair 
back as she poured the whiskey, &quot;we met once, but you may not remember.&quot;

        &quot;Ah, my binge,&quot; Ami winced.

        &quot;That wasn&#39;t a binge,&quot; the scarred twin chimed in, &quot;my sister 
drinks like that for fun.&quot; She smiled at Ami, &quot;Minagi.&quot;

        Ami was about to say something when hands grabbed her from 
behind, squeezing tightly as a familiar voice cried out, &quot;Ami! What are 
you doing over here?&quot; Ami turned quickly, watching the black haired 
woman freeze in surprise as she took in her scarred face. Rei Hino took 
a step backwards, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I thought....&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Ami said, feeling an odd mix of tearing pain 
and pleasure at seeing Rei standing before her, &quot;I guess this sort of 
thing happens here a lot.&quot;

        Rei smiled back, seemingly sensing the emotions that Ami hid 
beneath the calm surface. She looked Ami up and down and remarked, &quot;The 
suit looks good on you.&quot;

        With that Rei collected her drink and left, soon meeting with a 
Ami that looked much younger. The two hugged, a surprisingly intimate 
gesture, and Ami found herself wondering at the paths not taken. With a 
shake of her head she laid cash on the counter and collected the drinks, 
carefully retracing her way back to their table.

        Setsuna looked at Ami as she set the drtinks down and tyook her 
seat. &quot;Something happened, didn&#39;t it?&quot; she asked, gently laying her hand 
on Ami&#39;s.

        &quot;I saw Rei up at the bar,&quot; Ami said softly, eyes clenched shut 
as she fought to retain her control. She was surprised to feel another 
hand on her arm, and looked down with eyes swiming with tears at 
Chibi-Usa.

        &quot;You told me it was all right to cry,&quot; Chibi-Usa said softly, 
&quot;that goes for you too, right?&quot;

        Setsuna reached out to pull Ami close to her gently, holding the 
young woman as a few precious tears streaked her face. She stroked the 
back of Ami&#39;s head, patted her back, and generally said all the things 
you do when a friend is crying.

        &quot;You need to wipe your eyes,&quot; Setsuna said gently as Ami pulled 
back, &quot;your face is all red.&quot; Gently teasing, &quot;You don&#39;t know how to cry 
at all.&quot;

        &quot;Gee, thanks,&quot; Ami managed a smile, pulling a cloth from her 
pocket.</pre>
