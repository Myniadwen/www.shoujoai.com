<h1>Eien no Nedan (part 5 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ericafriedman.html">Erica Friedman</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/eiennedan-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>Sailor Moon could feel the dullness attack every sense, it climbed 
into her ears and nose, suffocating her. She could feel her arms grow 
heavy and her legs fail. She could feel her heart beat slower and 
slower, until, nearly bursting with the effort to continue it seemed 
to stop.... 

&quot;No, please!&quot; she screamed. 

And the sensation stopped. When Sailor Moon opened her eyes, she was 
standing in a large stone hall, the vaulted ceilings disappearing high 
above her. Her footfalls echoed heavily on the flagstones. She checked 
to see that all her limbs worked, and a quick pinch assured her that 
she was able to feel pain. 

Relieved and annoyed, she looked around, and could see several of the 
other Senshi struggling to determine where they were. Sailor Moon 
could not see everyone, however, and she panicked. 

&quot;Everyone!&quot; The other Senshi looked up, and seeing their Princess in 
difficulty, immediately centered on her. 

Sailor Moon looked around, a little desperately, but she did not see 
Sailor Saturn or Sailor Pluto. &quot;Where are Pluto and Saturn?&quot; she 
asked, to no one in particular. 

&quot;Here.&quot; Pluto&#39;s soft voice carried in the stone hall. She stood next 
to Sailor Saturn, one arm holding the girl up. Saturn leaned heavily 
on her Glaive, her head down. 

&quot;Saturn!&quot; Sailor Moon leapt forward. Sailor Saturn looked up weakly. 
Sailor Moon blanched. Her eyes looked so dull, and her face...Sailor 
Moon sucked in a breath as she realized that Saturn had been 
tremendously weakened. No longer a teenager at all, Sailor Saturn now 
looked older than the oldest of them. 

&quot;Saturn!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out into the vaulted ceilings. &quot;What are 
you doing to Sailor Saturn?&quot; 

&quot;I am taking back what is mine...&quot; a soft, musical voice made them all 
turn. 

At the end of the hall, a figure rose smoothly from a carved throne. 
The amber stone had disguised the figure, but as she stepped forward 
her hair shone in the light from a thousand candles. Her dress flamed 
with the same burnished glow, as she stepped lithely and silently 
across the floor. 

Sailor Moon watched Eternity closely, as she approached. She did not 
look evil, but then neither had so many of their enemies. Beryl had 
looked evil, true, but Neherenia, no, she hadn&#39;t looked evil, just 
desperate. Nor had Galaxia, or Diamaund. So few of them had been evil 
- just sad, deluded, manipulated. Sailor Moon searched Eternity&#39;s face 
for signs of the same symptoms - loneliness, isolation, longing. 

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; Sailor Saturn spoke sharply. &quot;Don&#39;t look into her eyes.&quot; 

Sailor Moon turned, &quot;Why not?&quot; 

&quot;She&#39;s not human, not even humanoid. This is just a form she&#39;s 
taken&#133;please.&quot; 

Sailor Moon looked again at Eternity, who now confronted her head on, 
looking every inch the queen. Sailor Moon smiled softly at the 
posturing. She had seen it before, it was no longer threatening. She 
could barely remember the days when she had been frightened of her 
enemies. It was a very long time ago, now. 

Eternity reached out and took Sailor Moon&#39;s face gently in one hand. 
&quot;You are very beautiful, Moon Princess.&quot; And she looked directly into 
Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes. 

&quot;No!&quot; Three Senshi leapt forward but it was too late, Sailor Moon&#39;s 
eyes had been caught. They could see her struggle, but Eternity kept a 
firm grip. Then slowly, Sailor Moon&#39;s wings began to unfurl and 
extend, wrapping the two women together in an embrace. As the Senshi 
watched, Sailor Moon lifted one hand, and tenderly touched the hand 
that grasped her chin. For a long moment there was complete silence, 
then Eternity thrust herself away from Sailor Moon, breaking the 
embrace as abruptly as if she had been shocked. 

Sailor Moon turned, eyes shining with emotion, to Sailor Saturn, then 
back to Eternity. 

&quot;Won&#39;t you please let Saturn go?&quot; she asked mildly. 

Eternity turned her back on the Senshi and made a low noise in her 
throat. &quot;Yes. Yes, I will. I have anticipated this moment for a long 
time.&quot; She whirled on Sailor Moon. &quot;I thought to draw this out, make 
you suffer for this outrage, but,&quot; her voice became dull and bitter. 
&quot;there would be no point. I cannot defeat you. And you,&quot; she laughed. 
&quot;you dare not destroy me.&quot; 

Sailor Uranus, who had been watching Sailor Saturn, now completely 
bowed over, launched herself at Eternity, screaming, &quot;I dare! 
World&#133;.!&quot; 

She was pulled up short as Sailor Moon stepped in front of Eternity. 
&quot;Damn!&quot; Uranus muttered, angry at herself for losing control. &quot;Tch.&quot; 
And her anger subsided as quickly as it began. She knew she could 
trust Sailor Moon, but it was hard, too hard, to watch Hotaru suffer 
like this. The girl was sinking slowly to her knees, and Sailor Uranus 
rushed to her side to cradle her. 

&quot;She&#39;s right.&quot; Sailor Mercury commented unexpectedly. &quot;Eternity as we 
see her is simply a created form. She is really the black hole in the 
center of the galaxy. As such, she is a vital part of nature. We 
really *can&#39;t* destroy her without upsetting the delicate balance of 
energy in the galaxy.&quot; 

&quot;Sailor Mercury - always so factual.&quot; Eternity spoke towards the girl, 
who stared bravely into Eternity&#39;s face. Sailor Mercury blanched at 
the vision of the black hole in all its raw power, but she did not 
look away. Eternity bit back a curse and turned away. 

Sailor Uranus laughed darkly. &quot;Losing your touch, aren&#39;t you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ll take back my power - and more. Sailor Moon&#133;&quot; she spun around to 
face her, &quot;you wanted Sailor Saturn back - then take her! I&#39;ll give 
you exactly what I was given. Here&#39;s your precious Sailor Saturn!&quot; She 
waved her hand towards Saturn&#39;s unconscious form and Saturn jerked 
once, then fell back into Sailor Uranus&#39; arms. Sailor Pluto leaned 
over Saturn and felt for a pulse at her wrist then neck. She did not 
look up at the others, just let her head drop and her shoulders slump. 
Uranus gritted her teeth, but said nothing. 

&quot;There. There is your Sailor Saturn - exactly as I found her.&quot; 
Eternity stretched her arms and turned her back on them. &quot;She is not 
dead, only nearly so. Just as I found her  millennia ago.&quot; Eternity 
began to walk away, heading for her throne at the end of the hall. 

&quot;Stop!&quot; Sailor Moon&#39;s voice commanded. &quot;You have no right to walk away 
from this Eternity. You gave Sailor Saturn energy, but have forced her 
to pay for it over and over. And now you attempt to crush the hearts 
of her family. I will not forgive you for that.&quot; 

Immediately Sailor Venus, Sailor Mercury, Sailor Mars and Sailor 
Jupiter lined up to either side of Sailor Moon. They all voiced their 
agreement. Sailor Neptune, who had joined Sailor Pluto and Sailor 
Uranus, now spoke up. 

&quot;Don&#39;t attack her! That is exactly what she wants, remember?&quot; 

Sailor Moon nodded grimly. &quot;I remember. And we&#39;re going to give her 
exactly what she wants.&quot; 

&quot;What?!&quot; The Inner Senshi all looked at Sailor Moon with surprise 
written clearly on their features.. 

&quot;Everyone trust me, please?&quot; Sailor Moon asked. With no hesitation, 
they all squared their shoulders and nodded, trusting in their 
Princess completely. 

&quot;Sailor Moon?&quot; The words were spoken so softly that no one recognized 
the voice at first. It took a moment for everyone to turn to Sailor 
Uranus, who still knelt, holding Saturn&#39;s limp form in her arms. 
Sailor Neptune put her hand to her mouth and tried to stifle the tears 
that entreaty brought to her eyes. Pluto didn&#39;t even look up, but kept 
her eyes fixed on Saturn&#39;s face. 

&quot;Eternity.&quot; Sailor Moon&#39;s voice was splendid, neither condemning nor 
cold, but noble and powerful. &quot;I feel very sorry for you. You were 
wrong when you said you loved her. Love does not do this. This,&quot; and 
she placed just a slight emphasis on the word, &quot;is what love looks 
like.&quot; Sailor Moon looked around her, and meeting everyone&#39;s eyes, 
moved to surround the three Senshi and Sailor Saturn. When they came 
close, Sailor Uranus laid Sailor Saturn carefully on the ground and 
stepped back to join the circle. 

The Senshi all lowered their heads. Tiaras disappeared from eight 
brows, replaced by planetary symbols. Power began to build around each 
Senshi, energy flowed from them and built into a palpable mass. 
Eternity stared, open-mouthed. When the power reached into the very 
corners of the hall, each Senshi lifted their arms, then, as one, 
focused them onto Sailor Saturn&#39;s body. Light, color and warmth all 
flowed from their hands into the inert body, animating it. For an 
infinite moment, everything around them disappeared, dissolved by the 
immense power they had built and Eternity&#39;s true nature was revealed 
at last. 

The sky roiled with energy in all frequencies. No light or sound would 
escape the mass destruction all around them. Nothing could escape. 
Time itself was rent and space was deformed in this place. Eternity 
was utter chaos, the potential energy of millions of stars all warped 
and wrenched until nothing of their true nature was left. 

The power from the Senshi continued to flow into Sailor Saturn, until 
she too began to glow. In a miasma of violet light, her form altered, 
growing both stronger, and vibrant. The violet light spread, including 
the encircling Senshi in its aura, until the very air around them 
crackled with its power. Then just as abruptly as the power had built, 
it stopped, drawing itself back into each of the Sailor Senshi with a 
finality that made Eternity gasp with longing. 

&quot;Love is infinite, Eternity. You can never give it away, since it 
returns itself many times over.&quot; Sailor Moon faced the entity, whose 
form was shimmering, as she lost her hold over herself. 

&quot;Give me your power, Sailor Moon!&quot; Eternity&#39;s voice rang out. &quot;I 
desire that energy.&quot; 

Sailor Moon held out her hands to face Eternity. &quot;Everyone?&quot; They all 
nodded and turned to face their nemesis. Eternity smiled as the energy 
built up around them once again. 

&quot;You fools! Don&#39;t you understand my true nature? I absorb energy. This 
is what I am!&quot; Eternity laughed gesturing at the chaos that surrounded 
them. &quot;Give me your energy and you will never escape!&quot; She laughed 
gleefully. &quot;I long for such power!&quot; 

&quot;Then you shall have it.&quot; Sailor Saturn rose from the ground. Eternity 
shrank back from the familiar form. The air around the newly 
resurrected Senshi sizzled with electricity. 

&quot;You&#39;re alive... well. I can take your energy again, Saturn. I drew 
you to me once, twice. You won&#39;t escape this time either&#133;&quot; 

The power that was building charged the very atoms around them. In 
Sailor Moon&#39;s hands appeared her Eternal Tiale, and she leveled it at 
Eternity, who stood facing her, a feral grin on her face. 

&quot;NOW!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out and nine pairs of hands grasped the 
Tiale. The energy that poured from them was the purest of white light 
and it blasted into Eternity as she stood there laughing. 

For a full ten seconds the power poured out from the Senshi, and the 
chaos around them slowed, stopped and left them in a timeless 
no-space, just the Senshi and Eternity connected by a cord of light. 

The shaft of energy cut out, as the Senshi lowered their hands. Their 
faces were flushed and sweating and they leaned on one another for 
support.. 

&quot;Ahahahahahahhhhhhh!!!&quot; Eternity stood, still laughing, as strong as 
she had been at the onset of the assault. &quot;You complete fools!&quot; She 
stood for one moment gloating, then without a sound, collapsed to the 
ground. 

Sailor Moon stood, not even fatigued, as Sailor Mercury used her visor 
and computer to scan Eternity. She turned with a confused look to 
Sailor Moon. &quot;She seems unchanged, but&#133;&quot; 

&quot;But what?&quot; Sailor Jupiter wasn&#39;t about to trust the supposedly inert 
form. 

&quot;We didn&#39;t kill her, surely?&quot; Venus popped her head around Jupiter&#39;s 
tall form, keeping her distance from their foe. 

&quot;No&#133;&quot; Sailor Mercury, but she didn&#39;t finish. 

&quot;Wake up, Eternity.&quot; Sailor Moon called out. Eternity&#39;s eyes blinked 
and she sat up, dazed. 

&quot;What&#133;what happened?&quot; she looked around, then her eyes narrowed and 
she spoke exultantly. &quot;I did it! I absorbed all the energy you gave 
me!&quot; She stood up and looked at her hands. &quot;You fools, there&#39;s nothing 
you can do to me now!&quot; she turned triumphantly to face Sailor Moon. 
The Senshi all looked with askance at their leader, worry, fatigue and 
tension clearly showing on their faces. 

&quot;Yes, there is.&quot; Sailor Moon said quietly and she turned away from 
Eternity. 

&quot;What?&quot; Eternity mocked her. &quot;What can you do to me?&quot; 

Sailor Moon hung her head sadly. &quot;We can take it all away.&quot; 

&quot;What?!?&quot; Eternity&#39;s voice echoed around her. Sailor Moon lifted her 
head and turned to face Eternity, blue eyes locked with amber ones. 

&quot;We have removed all of your energy, Eternity. And we have replaced it 
with ours. Without us, you will die. You were right, we couldn&#39;t 
destroy you - it would cause imbalance in the galaxy. But you were too 
powerful for your own good. I&#39;ve taken away all the power you&#39;ve 
absorbed over the millennia. And given you power that comes from us. 
This way you will continue to function - you can absorb light and 
energy as is your function, but from now on, any energy you do not 
need will come to us.&quot; 

&quot;You have&#133;&quot; Eternity faltered. 

&quot;Yes. I&#39;ve done to you what you did to Saturn all those years ago. In 
repayment for the debt I owe to her. She gave her life to save us and 
has suffered for it. And you were part of that. You had to be stopped. 
Your life is now tied with our own and you are beholden to us,&quot; The 
Senshi noticed a subtle changed in the timbre of her voice and with a 
shock they realized that Sailor Moon had meant the Royal &quot;Us.&quot; 

Sailor Moon turned and the Tiale disappeared from her hand. She looked 
at her Senshi and said simply. &quot;And now, I want to go home to 
Mamo-chan.&quot; Her voice broke. Sailor Saturn ran over and embraced 
Sailor Moon. Sailor Moon hugged the girl back and smiled at Pluto over 
the girl&#39;s shoulder. Uranus and Neptune leaned on each other, 
exhausted by relief and sorrow. 

&quot;Sailor Mercury, can you get us home?&quot; Sailor Moon turned to her 
friend. 

&quot;It would be my pleasure!&quot; Mercury lifted her computer and punched a 
few keys. &quot;Let&#39;s go.&quot; 

One last time the Senshi stood in a circle, and clasped hands. Once 
again time and space opened up and the Senshi rose into the air. 
Softly, as if in a dream, they disappeared, leaving Eternity alone in 
a world of her own making.

Epilogue 
 

If anyone had cared to notice, later that week there was, seemingly, a 
large family picnicking at Ichinohashi Park. Several adults, a few 
teens and one child had appropriated the choicest patch of ground 
overlooking the lake. 

Two boats, both filled with screaming girls, appeared to be reenacting 
naval battles from history out on the water, while two of the adults 
watched from the land, laughing. On the lake, well away from the 
battling row boats, two of the women were enjoying a quiet moment 
alone in a boat of their own. 

There was a terrific squeal and then, racing, the other two boats bore 
down upon the lone rowboat, their occupants clearly set on ramming the 
innocents. At the last minute, the blonde-haired woman who piloted the 
&quot;attackee&quot; slipped her vessel neatly between the two attackers, 
causing them to both overturn and dump their contents into the water. 

On land, one of the adults laughed so hard he began to choke, as his 
intended bride splashed noisily and ineffectually in the water, 
eventually crying for help , that she was drowning. When she noticed 
her friends were standing in the shallow water looking at her rather 
oddly, she tentatively put her feet down and finding the surface firm, 
stood up sheepishly. 

Usagi stalked out of the water, wringing her hair dry and muttering to 
herself. Mamoru stopped laughing long enough to grab up a blanket and 
wrap it around her, but she must have seen the smirk. Usagi grabbed 
the blanket ungratefully and sulked. Six bedraggled forms watched with 
various levels of amusement and annoyance as Haruka and Michiru, 
unscathed, docked their boat deftly and headed for their picnic. 

Chibi-Usa turned to Hotaru, who was coughing up a little water she had 
swallowed as the boat had gone over. 

&quot;Are you okay Hotaru-chan?&quot; Chibi-Usa asked, concern flashing in her 
eyes. 

Hotaru looked up, at Mamoru coaxing Usagi out of her sulk with food, 
at Rei, Makoto, Minako and Ami laughing at each other&#39;s appearances, 
at Haruka and Michiru setting out lunch and at Setsuna, still 
laughing. She looked down at Chibi-Usa and, regardless of their soaked 
clothing gave her a big hug. 

&quot;Yes, Chibi-Usa-chan... I&#39;m fine.&quot; </pre>
