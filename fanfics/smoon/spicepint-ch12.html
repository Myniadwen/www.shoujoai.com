<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 12 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Is this what you call success? The demon roared.

If a person was inside the closed office, all they would have seen was a 
very, very frightened man fidgeting on the spot from some invisible 
opponent. His eyes wildly darted around the office despite the fact that 
he knew the voice was resounding from inside his head. Sweat started to 
form as he felt himself become very warm from his racing heart.

Lubb dubb! Lubb dubb! Lubb dubb!

The gunman had failed. Now Manuke was left to deal with the 
consequences.

&quot;W-wait, I wasn&#39;t the one who failed, the man I hired did!&quot; He tried to 
reason.

Yes, the man YOU hired. You&#39;re incompetent after all! I have no such use 
for failures.

&quot;But- Argh!&quot; Manuke&#39;s hands came up to his head. He hissed and clenched 
his teeth together. He could feel his head throbbing inside, the 
sensation quickly gaining momentum. W-what&#39;s going on! He mentally 
shouted. To him it felt like something was worming its way into his 
head, forcing its way through, cutting off his thoughts that soon left 
him with only one- PAIN. &quot;Ahhhh...AH! Yah...hah...hah...S-stop it!&quot; He 
fell to his knees, feeling as though his head was about to explode any 
second now. &quot;ArrrrrRRRRRRRRGH!&quot;

Unleashing his final cry his body slumped to the floor in silence.

Thud.

...So easy... The demon mused. Now that the first plan had failed it 
supposed there was only one thing left to do. The child was useless 
but...

&quot;This body is another matter.&quot; Manuke&#39;s eyes snapped open, although they 
weren&#39;t his eyes anymore. The demon stood up in its new body and flexed 
its new hands under a watchful eye. It then tested the rest of the 
limbs, stretching lightly before pacing over to the desk.

Uncharacteristically it flopped down onto the office chair and leaned 
back, appreciating its new body. A young body was all the demon needed, 
beauty was irrelevant but was considered a sweet side bonus. &quot;As long as 
I have this, I can use my power to the fullest,&quot; It grinned. &quot;Now, let&#39;s 
see...I think... a visit is in order.&quot;

The demon pushed itself out of the chair and stood up once more. It 
walked to the middle of the room where it snapped its fingers.

Snap!

POOF!

In its place where Manuke&#39;s body once stood was instead a young woman. 
Her long black hair was tied up into a tight bun style and was dressed 
in a colorful kimono. She had been a soul whom the demon had taken in 
the glorious old days.

Mockingly the demon used the body to put on a innocent face and flipped 
open a small fan in its hands making a girly giggle, &quot;Who, little o&#39;l 
me?&quot; And then it burst out into evil laughter. &quot;So perfect, so perfect!&quot; 
It praised itself. &quot;Hmm...Now, onto business shall we?&quot;

Hikawa Shrine, Night

Hino Rei, Mar&#39;s reincarnation...Lived with her grandfather at the Hikawa 
Shrine. How...interesting. The demon thought. It had been paying 
attention to what its minion had been up to after all. While Manuke had 
been floundering about collecting information from his spies the demon 
had been secretly storing the information away. Perhaps it had expected 
the man to fail, was delighted by the outcome in fact. Not only did it 
gain one more soul to the pot, but also a body it could manipulate. Its 
revenge could be taken out through its own terms and plans. What could 
be more satisfying?

The manipulated woman slowly walked up the steps without difficulty, 
which would seem strange to any passerby. It was dark outside, aside for 
the crescent moon in the sky. Any normal person would have tripped or 
stumbled at least once or perhaps twice. IF there was someone out at 
this time. The streets were completely empty.

Tup...tup...tup...

Upon reaching the front entrance the woman paused to study the archway. 
A smile played upon her face seeing that there were no talismans 
present. The things were always nuisances in the past.

She continued forward into the front yard and rang the charm bells as if 
to make a wish. As expected, it had arisen the old man from his slumber. 
Rei&#39;s grandfather soon appeared around the corner to see who was here at 
such a time at night.

&quot;A young woman?&quot; He asked himself. He blinked and rubbed his eyes but 
the figure was still there. &quot;Hey there miss, is there something wrong? 
Are you lost?&quot;

The demon inwardly snickered at his kindness but replied, &quot;Yes.&quot;

Through the moonlight the old man eyed the woman. Something seemed off 
to him; she says she was lost, which was understandable, but she was 
dressed in clothing similar to the old era. No one walked around in 
kimonos these days unless there was a festival. The sight brought three 
options to mind. There was a festival he wasn&#39;t aware of, she was really 
out of town or she was a ghost. It wasn&#39;t uncommon for restless spirits 
to look for peace or eternal rest.

Whichever the case may be, Rei&#39;s grandfather was determined to give aid. 
How could he not help a beautiful, defenseless woman in need?

&quot;Perhaps I can help.&quot; He offered, stepping towards her. His limbs were 
moving about stiffly and they ached from his increasing old age. Many 
times a day he would complain about his arthritis but never to his 
granddaughter Rei. She was a popular singer now. She shouldn&#39;t have to 
be locked up doing chores at a shrine where she could be having fun and 
making a more socialized future for herself. That was his reasoning 
anyway, not that he would ever tell Rei. As much as he would have liked 
her company and her help he was standing his ground with the issue. The 
two of them had argued over the matter before but he managed to convince 
the hot-tempered woman to leave. He entrusted his precious granddaughter 
to Rei&#39;s friend Minako whether the two of them knew it or not. After 
seeing how the blonde and his granddaughter have spent time together, 
all he could get was a good feeling.

Besides, although he was old he refused to believe he had to sit in a 
nursing home and have people wait on him. The grandfather believed he 
could still live his life with independence and helping this woman now 
should prove it.

Standing a meter away from the mysterious woman the old man outstretched 
his hand to see if she really was a ghost or not.

&quot;Oh...I&#39;m sure you can...Ahaha...&quot; The woman lowered her head and began 
to laugh.

&quot;Miss?&quot;

&quot;AHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;

The last thing he thought was, Red eyes... &quot;AHHHHHHHHHHH!&quot;

Rei and Minako&#39;s apartment, Rei&#39;s POV

Ping!

&quot;Ah!&quot; I suddenly shuddered, feeling as though a bucket of cold water had 
been dumped over my head.

My eyes were now open, searching the room for some explanation. Did I 
just feel remnant emotions from a dream or some horrible memory? No, 
it&#39;s from the present. It&#39;s definitely much closer. I frowned, thinking 
in thought.

Tilting my head up slightly I shot a glance over at the clock to see it 
was 4:00 a.m.

Mina was still in my arms and I was still here, but there was something 
missing. It felt as though I had lost something precious to me.

Briiiiiiiiing... Briiiiiiiiing...

Someone was phoning us at this time of day? I stopped myself short of 
grumbling when Mina gave out a long sigh, making me flinch from the 
tickling feeling. I shouldn&#39;t wake her...

Carefully I shuffled backwards from the sleeping woman, allowing her to 
slide off of me and back onto the pillow with some of my assistance. 
Once that was done I slowly transferred my weight along the mattress 
little bits at a time as to not make any sudden loud noises. Mina and 
Venus were different people, who knew what the woman&#39;s sleeping habits 
were like in this life?

Tup.

As soon as my feet touched the floor I quietly dashed out and answered 
the damn machine, not bothering to pick up an article of clothing to 
cover myself. It was our apartment after all, who would be watching?

When I finally answered the persistent ringing, I had almost ripped the 
cord out in both irritation and hurry. If my exit hadn&#39;t awakened my 
partner then the phone surely will.

&quot;Hello?&quot; I whispered into the line. Whoever it was, they better have a 
good reason for getting me up.

&quot;Rei, are you up yet?&quot;

I blinked. &quot;Grandpa?&quot; Why was he calling now? &quot;Is something wrong? Are 
you okay?&quot;

There was a small pause from the other end. &quot;Come home.&quot;

&quot;Wait-!&quot;

Click.

Beep. Beep. Beep.

&quot;Come home...but why? Why did he just hang up like that?&quot; Slowly I put 
the phone back down and walked back to the bedroom in silence.

That feeling I had earlier... was it trying to warn me?

My feet had led me to stop beside the bed where I looked down at Mina&#39;s 
sleeping form. She looks so peaceful, much more relaxed than I&#39;ve ever 
seen her awake. My eyes trailed down one of her exposed arms before I 
noticed the goosebumps. She was shivering a bit. In a matter of seconds 
I fixed that little problem by pulling up the covers over her.

That should do it. I should probably also let her sleep for now... The 
phone call startled me but it couldn&#39;t be anything too serious. Grandpa 
might&#39;ve needed some help with the shrine duties and was just being his 
stubborn old self. He&#39;ll probably hand me a broom as soon as I get there 
instead of just asking for help. He knows I would say &#39;yes&#39; if he asked.

I resisted the urge to get back into the warm bed and turned away to 
dress myself. Besides the usual under garments I put on a casual shirt 
and pants. Nothing too fancy; I&#39;ll probably have to change into my old 
miko uniform once I get there.

&quot;I&#39;ll be back soon...&quot; I quietly whispered at the doorway and then left.

Click.

Hikawa Shrine, outside the steps

&quot;Grandpa?&quot; I called out. I expected him to be waiting for me at the 
entrance but he wasn&#39;t there.

It&#39;s cold.

I cautiously walked forward up the steps, watching my own shadow lead 
the way. Behind my back the sun was only rising. When I used to live at 
the shrine, I&#39;d sometimes get up early just to see the dawn before I 
went to do my daily chores. It mainly was to free up time for our old 
Senshi study sessions in the afternoons. But there was no time for that 
now.

Tup...tup...tup...

Maybe grandpa and Yuuichiro just wanted to see how I was doing. As soon 
as I get up there they&#39;ll probably jump out of hiding and try to scare 
me. It would be so typical of those two to do something like that. 
Grandpa was always dragging Yuuichiro around with his antics.

I finally reached the top of the steps and scanned the area. It appeared 
deserted but...

Ping!

&quot;What? Where did that come from?&quot; ...Bad feeling... &quot;Who&#39;s there? You 
better show yourself!&quot;

&quot;Rei...&quot; A voice echoed through the area, repeating my name. It sounded 
like grandpa&#39;s but creepier. It was so hard to explain. Distant? I 
just...couldn&#39;t stop shaking. &quot;Over here...&quot;

I turned my head to see a figure dart past a bush and into the woods, 
leading back towards the archery grounds.

If this was a joke, it wasn&#39;t very funny.

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

Trees and shrubs shuffled as I ran by them. It was still relatively dark 
in this area, as the sun had not yet risen enough to reach here. But it 
didn&#39;t matter. Who needed to see? I just ran after the voice and 
followed my senses.

I made a large leap into the open archery grounds, a flat field.

TUP!

Shiff...

Automatically I felt my eyes squint. Wait a minute. What... was ahead of 
me? I-Is that a body?

Ugh... The smell of rotting flesh drifted towards my direction with the 
wind. My hands pulled up my shirt up to help block out the smell. There 
was so much blood and the clothing material was tattered to shreds. If I 
hadn&#39;t noticed the clothing I would&#39;ve guessed that what I was seeing 
was an animal that met an untimely end. But since that wasn&#39;t the 
case...What was I going to do? Call the authorities? Seeing a dead body 
didn&#39;t seem to bother me so much as I thought it would. As Mars, corpses 
would litter the battlefields. There were many worse mutilated bodies 
than the one in front of me but I doubt I would be able to identif--

Crunch

I bent down to pick up a small, soft material and held it up to my eyes. 
There were minor specs of blood staining it. &quot;A blue cloth? It looks 
like apart of our shrine&#39;s male uniform. But only Yuuichiro and grandp-&quot;

DOOOM

Inside the city

Usagi was walking along the sidewalk outside of the Music Company&#39;s 
building with a frustrated look reflecting in her eyes. In her hands she 
carried a small device that was now dormant. The fact that is wasn&#39;t 
bleeping as it had minutes before worried her.

&quot;It&#39;s not here anymore...&quot; She frowned. But I know I saw it! It&#39;s 
definitely on the move... I&#39;ve got to get to &#39;their&#39; apartment.


Rei and Minako&#39;s apartment, Minako&#39;s POV

Knock, knock...

&quot;Mm...&quot; Lazily I rolled over onto my back and took in a deep breath. Was 
it morning already?

Knock, knock!

&quot;Mina, open up! It&#39;s Usagi!&quot;

I opened one eye. Usagi? I can&#39;t believe she&#39;s still around. Now I know 
there&#39;s no way it would take this long to sample all those foods. &quot;Rei, 
Usagi&#39;s at the door...Rei?&quot; She&#39;s gone?

I kicked off the covers and quickly slipped into something decent before 
I ran to open the door. It doesn&#39;t look like Rei is around here at 
all...

Click.

&quot;Usagi, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; The serious expression on her face startled me. I 
was already surprised that she would come this early in the morning 
being the sleepy head she was. But with that death look on her face...

&quot;Where&#39;s Rei?&quot; She nearly demanded.

&quot;R-Rei? I don&#39;t know...To be honest, I only woke up when you knocked. 
She must have left while I was asleep.&quot; Wait a minute... &quot;There&#39;s 
something wrong isn&#39;t there? What does it have to do with Rei?&quot; When 
Usagi looked down I gripped her by the shoulders and forced her to meet 
my eyes.

&quot;Do you remember when I told you...I was staying here for sample foods?&quot;

I nodded. &quot;That&#39;s not the real reason is it?&quot;

She took a deep breath. &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to track down a demon. In our 
past lives we trapped it within an amulet but it cracked from old age. 
I...I think its come back here for Rei. She was the one who trapped it 
after all.&quot;

I wanted to ask why it had to be Rei but I already knew why. &quot;Because 
she was Mars in her past life.&quot; I mouthed. But where could she have 
gone? Where could she be at this time of day? Did she even know there 
was something after her?

While I was panicking inside I silently resented how calm Usagi looked 
as she was telling me all this.

I felt myself frown. &quot;You said it came here for Rei right? Then why now, 
we&#39;ve been more than popular for awhile now...and I know you&#39;ve been 
here for at least a month. Isn&#39;t that how long its been around?&quot;

A guilty look filled Usagi&#39;s eyes. &quot;I couldn&#39;t get a reading on it until 
now.&quot; She bit her bottom lip. &quot;I&#39;m not a psychic like Mars or have the 
heightened sixth sense like Michiru. I&#39;ve been using a tracking device 
that Luna lent me. If the demon is in someone&#39;s body the machine won&#39;t 
read it. I can only detect it when it changes. As for why it&#39;s moving 
now I don&#39;t know. I...I just don&#39;t know...&quot;

&quot;Changes?&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t remember? Never mind, forget it, we need to find Rei NOW! 
It&#39;s on the move!&quot;

My mind plunged into battle mode. The answer immediately came to mind. 
&quot;The shrine. We&#39;ve got to go there. The enemy will attack her 
weakness...&quot;

Archery grounds, Rei&#39;s POV

Ping!

&quot;N-no way...It can&#39;t be!&quot; I fell to my knees, feeling shock grip me 
hard. It was just another dream right? Another memory, it&#39;s not real 
right? Before I knew it I had crawled close to the bloodied mess and 
stared at it for a long time. &quot;Why...Why can&#39;t I even recognize him?&quot; If 
I hadn&#39;t seen that clothing piece I wouldn&#39;t have... &quot;Who could have 
done...something this horrible...&quot; Hot tears rolled down my cheeks. 
Desperately I tried not to lose it.

Plip plip...

You took me in after no one else wanted me...you put up with my temper 
and joked with me as any good friend would. We would get into a lot of 
arguments wouldn&#39;t we? I&#39;d accuse you of being the pervert you were and 
they you&#39;d ask why&#39;d I always acted like I had a stick up my rear end. 
Not to mention that you were always SO stubborn! Why couldn&#39;t you put 
yourself ahead of me for once? If only you hadn&#39;t shooed me away when I 
made it into the music industry...if you would&#39;ve let me 
visit...idiot...you idiot...

Silence

I...feel so tired. Unconsciously my knees had come up to my chest and I 
hugged myself from the cold. Why do the people I care about disappear? 
Why...can&#39;t I just disappear?

With that thought a flame ignited in the air and wrapped itself around 
me in a cocoon of fire. It never touched me but circled ever so close 
over my huddled form...I don&#39;t want to think...I just wanted to watch 
the fire dance before my eyes.

Alone.

Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!

&quot;Rei!&quot; Mina-ko...? That sounded familiar.

&quot;Oh no, we&#39;re too late!&quot;

&quot;Usagi, what&#39;s happening to her?&quot;

&quot;Luna once said...That our...our powers are controlled through our 
transformations...but it really comes from our soul. If she keeps this 
up...she&#39;ll eventually kill herself.&quot;

&quot;NO! Rei, snap out of it!&quot;

I heard a flash footsteps and then another scream. The flames had shot 
up for a split second...

&quot;Leave me alone.&quot; Don&#39;t get near me.

&quot;Rei!&quot;

&quot;Stay away!&quot; The flames rose up into a column of fire. It was very 
warm...

An occasional flame would suddenly flicker and brush against my skin, 
burning it. But...I still felt so cold.

Do you feel pain child?

Whoever you are, get out.

Don&#39;t be so hasty...I&#39;m someone who can take that pain away.

&quot;Venus Crystal Power, Make-UP!&quot;

&quot;Moon Eternal, Make-UP!&quot;

Feeling lonely?

That&#39;s none of your business! I snapped. The pain started to sting 
again.

...What about the girl? Don&#39;t you have someone still?

Minako...Mina chan...She&#39;s all I have left. She&#39;s everything to me...

Unfortunately the voice had picked up on this. Tell me, do you really 
love her?

Lubb dubb!

You don&#39;t know do you? Pity that burdens of the past are forcing you to 
love her.

That&#39;s not true!

Isn&#39;t it? Your soul isn&#39;t your own. It&#39;s two. How do you know those 
aren&#39;t your true feelings? Maybe it&#39;s...your other self.

Shut up! How do you know about all this? I demanded.

Imagine it. You both thinking you&#39;re in love until that faithful day 
when you remember your true self. The poor girl will be crushed to hear 
that you really don&#39;t care for her. &#39;It was my past self&#39;. She could go 
as far as to commit suicide.

Suicide? My imagination brought up the image of a dead Mina sprawled on 
the ground. She wouldn&#39;t do that!

You can&#39;t tell the future. But... I can help you find out if your 
emotions are really as pure as you think them to be.

...How?

&quot;REI!&quot;

SHHhHHhHhhhhhhHhh...

Minako&#39;s POV

The column of fire suddenly died down into nothing. Terrified I watched 
Rei&#39;s body come into sight and slump to the ground. &quot;REI!&quot; In a matter 
of seconds Usagi and I had de-transformed and were by the woman&#39;s side. 
&quot;Rei, speak to me.&quot; I pulled her onto my lap and shook her.

&quot;This isn&#39;t good...&quot; I heard Usagi mutter. There was a dark look on her 
features. I couldn&#39;t tell whether it was a shadow from the sunlight or 
if she was really angry.

&quot;What&#39;s not good? You don&#39;t think...you don&#39;t think it&#39;s just like that 
time do you?&quot; In our pasts when the demon had stolen a piece of Mar&#39;s 
soul the soldier fell dormant.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Then what?&quot; If Rei hadn&#39;t been positioned on my lap I would&#39;ve jumped 
to my feet and hit Usagi for being so cold. Becoming mature doesn&#39;t mean 
you have to hide all of your emotions, future queen or not. Here I am 
ready to cry my eyes out and she&#39;s-I paused. Crying?

&quot;The demon&#39;s taken it. Mar&#39;s soul...&quot; Tears started to roll down her 
cheek. &quot;Can&#39;t you feel it? Do you realize what this means Mina chan? 
Every battle she&#39;s done as Sailor Mars, everything we did together when 
we fought evil...she won&#39;t remember it.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; That can&#39;t be... &quot;All that time we&#39;ve spent together...she won&#39;t 
remember it?&quot;

&quot;O-only...as...part of our t-team...&quot;

My heart stopped when I heard, &quot;Mm...&quot; Rei&#39;s eyes slowly opened. She 
looked so tired and yet somehow different. I could already see what 
Usagi meant. There was that calmness she didn&#39;t have before. The 
intensity she used to have has dimmed significantly. It was like she was 
suddenly a different person.

&quot;Rei, how do you feel?&quot; I cautiously asked.

&quot;Why am I here?&quot; She blinked and scanned the surroundings. A frown 
immediately washed over her face.

She...doesn&#39;t remember the attack?

To my side Usagi stepped over a few steps to block the sight of her dead 
grandfather. Goddess knows if Rei remembers that episode as well.

&quot;Ah...you collapsed.&quot;

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Rei tilted her head. &quot;I thought you went back home.&quot; She 
narrowed her eyes suspiciously. &quot;And why are you crying? Don&#39;t tell me 
you tripped and fell again.&quot;

Well at least she&#39;s still as blunt as ever.

&quot;I...umm...&quot; She fumbled for an excuse. Hastily she brushed aside her 
tears. &quot;I just came to see how you were doing and you treat me like 
this? Some friend you are!&quot; She stuck out her tongue, bringing Rei to do 
the same. The former fire senshi jumped up from my lap to argue with 
Usagi.

&quot;Stupid Odango!&quot;

&quot;Short tempered witch!&quot;

...I&#39;m happy Rei woke up but...How different will she be if she doesn&#39;t 
remember battling at all?

...It&#39;ll be like she never was Sailor Mars...

...how will that change the way I feel?
