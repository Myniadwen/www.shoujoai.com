Ami giggles at the note. It was another silly note from Makoto. She&#146;s 
had two other ones since they...ah...found out about the plane crash. 
She shakes her head and tucks it away in her pocket.

&#147;Another note?&#148; Kaya straightens her glasses, grinning.

&#147;Yes. Another note.&#148; Ami shakes her head and continues writing her 
book report. &#147;&#146;Som&#146;in Silly&#146;&#148; Ami shakes her head and laughs. &#145;Where 
does Makoto get these ideas?&#146;

&#147;Makoto&#146;s?&#148;

&#147;Yep.&#148; Ami continues to write until the phone rings. Ami carries the 
book with her and picks up the phone. &#147;Mizuno Residence...May I ask 
who&#146;s calling.&#148; Ami sets her book aside and points to the other phone. 
She crosses her lips with her index finger. &#147;Sorry but she can&#146;t come 
to the phone right now. May I take a message?&#148; Kaya takes the cordless 
and brings it up to her ear, covering the mouthpiece. 

&#147;Are you Mizuno Ami?&#148;

&#147;Yes I am.&#148; Ami nods her head, even though they couldn&#146;t see.

&#147;We&#146;re calling from St. Boniface, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. We seem to 
have your father.&#148;

&#147;...My father?&#148; Ami suddenly goes pale. She drops her book; pages go 
flying in different directions. Ami collapses to the ground, her knees 
finally giving way. &#147;H-How is he?&#148;

&#147;Well...&#148; On the other end, you could hear shuffling. The woman starts 
talking in hushed tones. &#147;I&#146;m sorry, miss. But he...he&#146;s in critical 
condition and asked to see you...at least for me to call...&#148;

&#147;Thank you...&#148; Ami bites back tears and swallows the lump in her 
throat. &#147;What is your name?&#148;

&#147;...Wanda. Wanda Winfield.&#148;

&#147;Thank you Wanda. I&#146;ll be there as soon as I can-&#147; Ami breaks off in 
tears and hangs up the phone, Kaya right after. She runs over to Ami&#146;s 
side and takes her in her arms. She didn&#146;t talk or rock her; Kaya just 
stayed stock-still and let Ami cry it all out. 


That night, Ami stayed awake with no more tears to shed. &#145;He&#146;s on his 
death bed and here I am, moping around.&#146; Ami looks over at her mother. 
&#147;I&#146;ve got to go, mom. I&#146;ve got to see him.&#148;

&#147;I know, honey, but...&#148; Kaya runs a hand through her hair. How could 
she say no? &#147;Then I&#146;m coming with you.&#148;

&#147;But your work-&#147;

&#147;I&#146;ll say it&#146;s a family emergency.&#148; Kaya states sadly. She reaches 
over to brush away Ami&#146;s hair.

&#147;Then we leave in the morning.&#148; Ami&#146;s voice cracks but she still sits 
up. &#147;Call and book the tickets, then. I want to leave in the morning.&#148; 
She looks at her digital clock. It read 2:09. &#147;Four days...&#148; She 
mumbles.

6 September 2003

Makoto finishes tying up her hair and applies her earrings. She takes 
her school bag and walks into the front room. Something catches her 
eye. She walks over to her message machine and presses play. 

&#145;Welcome to call answering; you have one new message. Message one 
received today at two, forty-five a.m.

&#145;...Sigh...hello Makoto, I...damn it! Listen, tell the others I won&#146;t 
be come&#151;I won&#146;t be coming to school for a while&#146; Ami clears her throat 
and shuffles around. &#145;Don&#146;t worry about me. I&#146;m fine and with my 
mother...god Makoto...&#146; Ami sobs and, presumably, collapses. &#145;My 
father, he&#146;s...&#146;

&#145;Ami...&#146; Some more shuffling, the crying fades into the background.  
&#145;Ami&#146;s father...&#146; Kaya sucks in her breath. &#145;He&#146;s in bad shape and 
we&#146;re-&#145; click

&#145;End of message; to play the message again press &#150; &#145; click.

Makoto sets the phone down and stares blankly at the receiver. She 
shakes her head and picks up the phone; she quickly dials a number and 
waits for the recording. &#147;Hello Minako, it&#146;s me Makoto. Tell the 
others that Ami&#146;s helping me with...how to deal with the death of my 
parents. Tell them what you know if you want, but be sure to tell them 
we won&#146;t be&#151;we won&#146;t be around for a while.&#148; Makoto places the phone 
down and wipes the tears away from her eyes. She takes out her 
communicator and does a search for Ami. &#145;She&#146;s nowhere in Tokyo...&#146; 
Makoto shakes her head and hurries into her room. &#145;I&#146;m going to find 
her.&#146; Makoto starts up her computer and enters a hidden room. 

Green_thunder: SHINO!!

Makoto waits for Shino to reply, wracking her brain for everything she 
knows about Ami&#146;s father. For one, he&#146;s never around. Two, he&#146;s a 
painter and three, he travels a lot.

Blue_lighting: What

Green_thunder: I need you to find someone for me

Blue_lightning: if it&#146;s important I&#146;ll have the information for you in 
an hour

Green_thunder: I need you to track down Ami and Kaya Mizuno

Blue_lightning: isn&#146;t that girl your friend?

Green_thunder: yes. That&#146;s why I need you to find her

Makoto waits anxiously for blue lighting to answer. Eventually he 
does.

Blue_lightning: give me half an hour.

@;-&gt;--

Makoto walks unsteadily with her bag at hand. She didn&#146;t even bother 
grabbing her coat. Makoto shivers and rubs her arms to fend off the 
chill. Before Makoto left Tokyo, she called her uncle for a favour. He 
was going to wire her a ticket and arrange a ride. All she had to do 
was wait until she got the ticket and the driver would drive her to 
St. Boniface hospital. Inside Winnipeg, Manitoba.

There was no choice really. Makoto knew she couldn&#146;t get back on a 
plane again, not after what had happened with her parents and 
her...counter part. Yet she couldn&#146;t just let Ami face this thing 
alone. Ami had called, after all, and she even tried to tell her where 
she was going until her machine cut them off. It had to mean that Ami 
wanted Makoto with her.

Makoto thought about real hard. She now knew where they were going and 
she could have wired, but in Ami&#146;s state it wouldn&#146;t have brought her 
back. Makoto knew she had to do something, and soon, if anything was 
to be done at all. And then, as though she could see Makoto&#146;s face in 
front of her, she knew what he would have done. Where he was going and 
why. He was going to help his sister, his family.

Makoto clutches the ticket to her chest and watches another plane take 
off. &#145;Jupiter help me.&#146;

@;-&gt;--

Makoto had had a really hard time boarding the plane. She boarded the 
plane first-class, with a small bag she had brought with her. She was 
still in her school uniform and had no jacket. Her only goal was to 
get to Ami before anything happened to her father. And that was the 
only thing that got Makoto on the plane, as her legs trembled beneath 
her.

She was shown her seat by the stewardess, and she closed her eyes and 
sank into the chair, trying not to remember the last plane she was 
supposed to be on, or who she was supposed to be with when it 
happened.

&#147;May I get you anything, Madame?&#148; The stewards for first-class were 
very attentive. Looking very pale, Makoto shook her head with a wan 
smile. &#147;It helps some people to look out the window.&#148; He suggests.

&#147;I&#146;m afraid I really don&#146;t think so.&#148; As they were pulling out of the 
airport a little while later, Makoto found herself thinking about the 
other Makoto&#146;s father and how much he looked like her own.

The stewards observed Makoto with a mixture of disappointment and 
concern. They were having trouble understanding what ailed her. They 
assumed she was motion sickness but quickly crossed that off. It was 
common that they had people afraid to fly but they never had a case 
this bad. She never left her seat, she kept her curtain drawn, and 
whenever they walked past her, she looked dreadful and terribly pale. 
She looked more like someone suffering from grief or terrible trauma.

&#147;Madame is sad?&#148; The man asks with fatherly concern. Makoto smiles up 
at her from something she was writing. At least it kept her mind 
occupied while she tried not to think about where she was. &#145;She&#146;s a 
young woman, but a very serious one.&#146; The steward takes a seat down 
beside Makoto. After a while, they were beginning to wonder if she was 
a writer. &#147;It&#146;s really a beautiful view, Madame.&#148;

Then they were beginning to wonder if she was traveling to escape a 
broken love affair. 

&#147;It&#146;s nothing like that, really.&#148; Makoto chuckles nervously, gripping 
the armrests to her seat. 

&#147;Would Madame please eat something?&#148; The French man offers her a 
sandwich. &#147;At least get up and stretch your legs. You&#146;ve been sitting 
for hours.&#148;

&#147;I...uh...&#148; Makoto takes the sandwich cautiously. It reminded her of 
Ami, Makoto smiles. &#147;Thank you, sir.&#148;

&#147;Declan.&#148; The man offers.

&#147;Thank you, Declan. I&#146;m Kino Makoto.&#148; She shakes his hand, 
surprisingly firm.

&#147;Aw...so Madame is a fighter?&#148;

&#147;Yeah...&#148; Makoto pulls her arm back, incidentally hitting the curtain 
making it recoil. She smacks her hand against the window in her haste 
to keep it down. She sees the ocean beneath her and tries to look away 
but finds it impossible. She starts trembling a little, her face 
seemingly going paler. 

The man reaches over and closes her curtain. &#147;Are you okay?&#148;

&#147;Ah...y-y-yeah.&#148; Makoto gulps and pries herself from her seat. &#147;I need 
to go to the washroom.&#148; She stands rock-still in the middle of the 
isle. The man quickly stands to assist Makoto. He walks her down the 
isle, towards the washroom. &#147;T-thank you, Declan.&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll get a woman to assist you, when you...finish.&#148; Declan blushes 
and slowly makes his way back. He watches Makoto stagger into the 
washroom and hears her throw up. True to his word, he finds an older 
woman. &#147;She says she&#146;s a fighter.&#148;

&#147;What&#146;s her name?&#148; The woman asks. 

&#147;Kino Makoto.&#148;

&#147;Kino. Makoto.&#148; The older woman runs that through her brain. &#147;Why&#146;s 
that sound familiar?&#148;

&#147;Edwina.&#148; Declan gently takes the older woman&#146;s arm and leads her to 
the washroom. &#147;Keep the blinds closed and don&#146;t let her out of your 
sight.&#148;

&#147;Hn.&#148; Edwina leans against the opposite wall and waits. Declan just 
grins at her and leaves. Behind the door, Edwina could hear the poor 
girl trying to throw up. &#145;Gotta hurt her stomach.&#146; She reaches over to 
knock on the door when it opens by itself. Still a little hazy, Makoto 
drops into a fighting stance. &#147;Down, Cherie.&#148; Edwina laughs and takes 
Makoto&#146;s fist in her hand. &#147;I take care of you.&#148; 

&#147;What?&#148; Realization dawns on Makoto. She goes pale and starts 
trembling lightly. She stands up and walks past Edwina. &#147;I don&#146;t need 
to be taken care of.&#148; She walks coolly down the isle, past the 
stewards and straight to her seat. Hoping Edwina left her; Makoto 
sinks into her chair and sighs. Instead, she sits down next to her.


&#147;Are you from Kyoto?&#148; Edwina asks. She had been basically talking to 
herself for the past hour since Makoto was trying to make a point for 
her to leave.

&#147;No, I&#146;m not.&#148; Makoto replies reluctantly. Edwina just wouldn&#146;t get 
the point. &#147;Tokyo.&#148;

&#147;I see. And you are going where?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m going to Canada to help my friend.&#148; Makoto whispers into the hot 
cloth.

&#147;Quite a long way to meet a friend.&#148; Edwina mumbles into her own 
cloth.

&#147;Well, that&#146;s just like me.&#148; Makoto takes the cloth off and smirks. 
&#147;Ami would probably say something like &#145;you have a chronic impulsive 
disorder&#146;.&#148;

&#147;And this Ami&#146;s the one you&#146;re going to find?&#148; Edwina prods gently. 
She takes off her cloth to see that Makoto had gone grim again. &#145;At 
least she&#146;s not pale.&#146;

&#147;Uh huh.&#148; Makoto fingers the spine of her notebook. She subconsciously 
pulls it on her lap and takes out the pen. She leans over and starts 
writing a few things before closing it again. She comes back up, some 
of her colour drained. &#147;I&#146;ll never get used to flying on a plane.&#148;

&#147;What ever it is, Makoto, it can&#146;t be all that bad...I&#146;m sorry.&#148; 
Edwina touches her arm but she didn&#146;t turn to face her. Then, in the 
kindest voice Makoto&#146;s ever heard, she asks a very difficult question. 
&#147;Has something really awful happened to you?&#148; She couldn&#146;t bear to see 
the suffering in her eyes, and she had looked that way since as long 
as she could remember.

&#147;I&#146;m usually not this mawkish.&#148; Makoto smiles and wipes the tears away 
with a graceful hand.

&#147;Any particular reason?&#148;

&#147;I just don&#146;t like planes anymore...they&#146;re just too many...&#148; Makoto 
stopped at the word memories, and decides to throw caution to the 
wind. She didn&#146;t know who Edwina was but at the moment, they were 
friends. &#147;I know planes crash every-&#147;

&#147;You survived a plane-humph!&#148; Makoto clamps her hand over Edwina&#146;s 
mouth.

&#147;Sh!&#148; Makoto chuckles nervously. &#147;I...kinda did...&#148; She cautiously 
removes her hand and runs it through her hair. &#147;Almost nine years 
ago...I accidentally sent a friend on the plane I was supposed to be 
on...&#148;

&#147;And the plane crashed.&#148; Edwina finished. Makoto nods and places the 
hot-cloth back on her face. Edwina mentally rakes her brain for any 
such memory. &#145;Nine years ago...&#146; 

&#147;They labelled it &#145;the Kino Crash&#146;.&#148; Makoto offers, her voice thick 
with emotion. 

&#147;But Makoto died in the hospital.&#148; 

&#147;Aino Makoto.&#148; Makoto agrees sadly. She takes off the cloth and opens 
her book again. &#147;One of my best friends&#146; brother.&#148; Makoto sniffles and 
jots something down. She closes her book again and puts it away. &#147;I 
lost everyone close to me that day.&#148; She leans over and rests her head 
on Edwina&#146;s shoulder.

&#147;I&#146;m sorry...&#148; Edwina strokes her hair gently, eventually putting her 
to sleep.

7 September 2003

Ami walks solemnly into her hotel room. &#147;What are they waiting for, 
mom?&#148;

Kaya looks down at her daughter. She looked so sad and scared right 
now. &#147;They&#146;re waiting for another transfer of blood.&#148;

&#147;What type?&#148; Ami asks, already regretting the answer.

&#147;Oh positive.&#148; Kaya kicks off her shoes and collapses into bed. 
&#147;Ami...we&#146;ve been at the hospital all night. Take a bath and try to 
get some sleep. He&#146;ll still be there tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;Will he, mom?&#148; Kaya opens her eyes and looks across the room at Ami&#146;s 
tear stained face. &#147;Can you honestly tell me that you know he&#146;ll be 
there tomorrow? That he...he&#146;ll still be alive...&#148;? Ami turns away and 
walks into the washroom, locking the door behind her.

&#147;Ami!&#148; Kaya knocks on the washroom door. &#147;Ami, open the door.&#148;

&#147;No!&#148;

&#147;Ami...&#148; Tears well up in Kaya&#146;s eyes as she slides down to the floor. 
&#147;Please, Ami?&#148; She knocks weakly on the door. &#147;I can&#146;t promise you 
anything...&#148; Ami slowly opens the door and collapses into Kaya&#146;s arms, 
crying. &#147;I can&#146;t promise you anything, Ami...&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry...&#148;
