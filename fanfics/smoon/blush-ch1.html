<h1>Blush</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/dreiser.html">Dreiser</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Every time I look at you, really look at you, a blush covers 
your features and you smile at me softly.

	You smile at me with a look of love in your eyes.

	Why haven&#39;t I ever noticed that?

	Is it because we&#39;re such good friends? Or because our 
duty as Senshi has kept me so distracted?

	Distracted? No, that&#39;s not the right word.

	Kept me so dense? Yes, that&#39;s much more apt.

	But somehow I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s my role as a Senshi that 
has kept me from acknowledging just what it meant every time you 
would blush at me. 

	Perhaps it was my own fear of love and being loved. It&#39;s 
hard to explain why exactly I fear it so.

	I suppose it all goes back to my parents and their deaths. 
Deep inside I&#39;m afraid to love anyone as much as I loved them 
because somehow I think that they&#39;ll leave me too.

	That as soon as I truly give my heart away that person will 
abandon me.

	Like my Sempai did.

	I chuckle to think of it. Whenever I speak of him you 
always look at me with such concern in your eyes.

	But what&#39;s really sad is that what I felt for him doesn&#39;t even 
begin to compare to what I feel for you.

	My love for him was a joke. An escape. He was a focus 
for my affections. A blind sort of obsession.

	Something for me to fixate on.

	I wonder, am I the same thing for you? Just something for 
you to focus your affections on? Or do you truly love me?

	You&#39;re looking at me now and your eyes, they&#39;re so deep 
that I think that I could drown in them.

	How is it possible for one person to have such a vast 
ocean of depth to them?

	Depth.

	Yes, there&#39;s a depth to you. One so powerful that it makes 
it impossible for me to believe that I&#39;m some sort of passing phase 
for you.

	You really do love me, don&#39;t you?

	With a tilt of my head, I make up my mind and slowly rise 
to my feet then cross to stand in front of you.

	Your eyes lift to meet mine and like so many times before 
you blush lightly and offer me a tender smile. Then your gaze 
darkens in concern and you frown slightly.

	Only seconds have passed but already you&#39;ve noticed that 
something is wrong with me. Why haven&#39;t I been just as observant 
with you? Why did I waste so much time?

	&quot;Mako-chan? Is something wrong?&quot;

	Instead of replying, I reach out to cup your cheek in a 
gentle hold and I can hear the quiet gasp you give at this.

	&quot;Mako-chan...?&quot;

	I&#39;ve never heard your voice sound so uncertain. It&#39;s soft 
and trembling and your eyes seem to waver as they hold my own.

	It&#39;s then that I finally realize it. Realize why I never noticed 
your feelings for me.

	Realize that and why you never approached me.

	Just like me, you&#39;re afraid.

	Afraid of your feelings and afraid of my reaction. Afraid of 
what would happen if you told me how you felt.

	Thank god your blush gave you away.

	I bend down so our faces are only inches away and I can 
feel your breath on mine as I offer a slow smile.

	&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

	Your voice is shaking now and there&#39;s definite question 
lying in it and I can tell that you&#39;re getting impatient.

	Funny, I&#39;ve never thought you to be the impatient type. I 
wonder what else that I don&#39;t know about you?

	Ah well, I have plenty of time to find out now.

	Pushing back some stray strands of your hair, my smile 
widens as I murmur, &quot;Have I ever told you how beautiful you are 
when you blush, Ami?&quot;

	Your response is the exact one that I expected.

	You blush lightly and duck your eyes from mine.

	And when I see it I feel at peace because I know that 
because of it I&#39;ll never be alone again.

	Because now I have you. You, and your love for me. And 
in return, my love for you.

	But despite all of this, I still can&#39;t understand one very 
simple thing.

	Why haven&#39;t I ever noticed it before?

-End-

	
Both characters in this fanfiction are from the series Sailor Moon. 
This fanfic came about for some pretty strange reasons. Mainly, I 
saw a link posted on the yuri mailing list I&#39;m on for the Church of 
Ami and Makoto. I noticed that the person who maintains it said 
they haven&#39;t seen any fics for the coupling and the pictures on the 
site were just so darn kawaii that I just had to write a fic for the 
couple. So that&#39;s the reasons behind this being written. I hope any 
and all fans of the romantic pairing enjoyed reading this.
