I am become death, the destroyer of worlds.

The Bhagavad-Gita, chapter eleven.

---The Silver Millennium---

Minerva looked in horror at the being now floating in the air in front 
of her. &quot;Maiya...&quot; she gasped, clutching her ribs in pain, &quot;If you&#39;re in 
there, fight it.&quot;

The thing that was once the princess&#39; chancellor laughed. &quot;Pathetic.&quot; 
she hissed, &quot;I am Babylon, not some trifling little spirit. She can no 
more fight my control than you could resuscitate your subjects back to 
life. I will kill you Minerva, leaving nothing behind but a dead husk of 
rock where your kingdom once was. Then I will go with what&#39;s left of my 
fleet and I will do the same with each of the other worlds, starting 
with the next closest, Pluto.

Minerva&#39;s grey eyes widened at that, as Babylon&#39;s cruel smile widened, 
&quot;Oh yes, Minerva. The princess in that picture you seem to like so much, 
she will be the next to die by my hands. Then all the others will fall, 
just like you; with the screams of their subjects ringing in their 
ears.&quot;

The princess looked at the monster before her as she clenched her fists. 
&quot;No.&quot; she growled out in an almost guttural voice. Her people were dead, 
and even without Babylon carrying out her threat, the monarch felt 
fairly certain her injuries were terminal. She was going to die no 
matter what, a failure to her people. But, perhaps, if she could defeat 
this thing here, she could save her &quot;sisters.&quot;

She would do it. She would give her life for theirs.

&quot;NO!&quot; she screamed, launching herself at the demon with incredible 
speed. Grabbing the demon off-guard, it took a second or two for her to 
summon up the dark field around herself once again. By that point, the 
two of them were already three-quarters of the way to the mothership. 
Babylon, realizing what Minerva had in mind, began desperately striking 
out at her through the Senshi&#39;s force field, slashing and hitting her as 
she tried to kill her before they reached the control ship.

From the bridge, all Commander Yukio had time to see on the view screen 
was two balls of energy, one gold and one black, headed straight for his 
ship. Before he could even react, the two crashed into the control room 
with all the force of a small bomb before crashing through the back of 
the room on their way to the warp engine. Some of the crew were killed 
instantly, while others were either sucked out into space due to the 
sudden decompression or pulled after the two battling women.

Minerva ignored her now broken cheekbone and her two black eyes as she 
closed in on her goal. If this ship was in any way similar to the ship 
the emissaries from Neptune had used, the engine was close by. Babylon 
sunk her claws deep into Minerva&#39;s abdomen, ripping it open and in 
effect disemboweling her just as they finally reached the warp drive.

&quot;War arrows! War arrows! War arrows! WAR ARROWS!&quot; the Senshi screamed.

The resulting explosion destroyed not only the mother ship, but the 
other three war vessels nearby, and left a large circular scorch mark on 
planet Minerva&#39;s surface. Her host body destroyed, the shockwaves sent 
Babylon deep into the outer recesses of Space.

Meanwhile, tens of thousands of miles away, the ruler of Pluto suddenly 
felt an intense, inexplicable sadness overtake her. Unable to account 
for the sudden melancholy, she shook it off as she went back to check up 
on the timegate.

---South Orange Grove, Texas---

---June 20, 1952---

Jack Parson&#39;s was working in his laboratory alone when, at 5:08 PM, the 
place blew up. The explosion killed the scientist and magician 
instantly.

The official cause of death was that he had simply dropped a container 
of fulminate of mercury, but none of his friends seemed to buy this 
explanation. Various occult writers have provided alternate theories to 
account for his demise, but of course none proved correct.

Only one person knew the truth.

And she wasn&#39;t telling.

---Tokyo, the Present---

She closed her eyes tight as she felt the other woman explore her body 
tenderly, almost reverently with her hands, her mouth, and her tongue. 
She took a quick intake of air as she clutched onto her partner&#39;s long 
brown hair, arching her back as she felt something build up within her. 
She could feel her muscles begin to tighten up, and her breath was now 
coming in quick pants. Her pelvis began to move in rhythm with her 
lover&#39;s movements, and as the heat rising up in her reached a crescendo 
she opened her mouth and cried out as every muscle in her body went 
rigid. The intense sensation over, she went limp, physically drained 
from the experience.

As she lay on the bed panting for air, sweat beading off her brow, her 
partner poked her head out from underneath the covers and carefully 
turned her over onto her side. She then felt her partner lovingly pull 
her closer from behind so that her nude body was spooned up against 
hers. She was using the woman&#39;s right arm as a pillow, and she could 
feel her lover&#39;s breath against the nape of her neck. Her partner kissed 
her on the cheek as she brought her lips up to her ear.

&quot;Setsuna.&quot; she heard Kihomi whisper as her left hand slowly caressed 
back and forth across her abdomen, &quot;Sets-chan, are you alright?&quot;

Setsuna nodded her head as she slowly felt herself recovering. &quot;Kihomi.&quot; 
she said nervously.

&quot;Yes?&quot; the teacher asked as she kissed her along the jaw line.

She wondered if it was too soon, if Kihomi shared the feelings or would 
pull back from her if she said it. She was scared, but even so she felt 
the need to give voice to her feelings. Taking a deep breath, she closed 
her eyes and blurted out what was in her heart.

&quot;I love you.&quot;

There was silence in the room as neither woman moved a muscle. Then, 
after a few agonizing seconds, she felt herself being hugged tighter by 
the woman behind her.

&quot;I love you too Setsuna-chan.&quot; Kihomi answered, &quot;With all my heart.&quot;

Setsuna closed her eyes and smiled as she felt her lover&#39;s naked body 
against her back, and she began to wiggle a bit as she settled into 
Kihomi&#39;s embrace. She felt so safe, so happy in her arms.

As the teacher heard Setsuna&#39;s breath slow down a bit, she glanced 
quickly over to the small clock on the table by the bed. It was five 
o&#39;clock. As she continued to rub her hand slowly across the woman&#39;s 
smooth flat abs, she smiled to herself. If she had to leave tomorrow to 
go to some hospital off in Nagoya, she couldn&#39;t think of anything else 
she&#39;d rather be doing than this, or anyone else she&#39;d rather be with. 
Kihomi kissed Setsuna&#39;s shoulder as the Senshi let out a contented sigh.

&quot;Setsuna-chan?&quot;

&quot;Hmmm...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re awful quiet. What are you thinking?&quot;

&quot;I... didn&#39;t get much sleep last night.&quot; she admitted. The night had 
been long and painful for Setsuna, who had been brooding over leaving 
Kihomi the way she did, to say nothing of the fact that someone had 
gained access to the timegate yet again. &quot;And I&#39;m thinking that, as 
comfortable as I am right now, I could very easily fall asleep if I&#39;m 
not careful.&quot;

&quot;Well, it&#39;s five now. I have nowhere else to be if you want to take a 
nap.&quot;

Setsuna turned her head to look back at Kihomi, &quot;Really?&quot; she asked, 
&quot;You wouldn&#39;t mind?&quot;

The teacher chuckled a bit, &quot;Of course not.&quot; she said, leaning over to 
kiss her lover on the cheek, &quot;I&#39;ll wake you up at seven, and we can grab 
dinner or something.&quot;

Setsuna looked at the teacher&#39;s smiling face a few seconds before 
bringing her lips to the other woman&#39;s. Pulling back, she smiled as she 
lay her head back down on Kihomi&#39;s arm. Snuggled close in the teacher&#39;s 
embrace, she closed her eyes and was soon fast asleep.

------

As Beniko left the back room she and Marika had been sharing, she found 
Professor Miyagawa pacing impatiently as he waited for her. Raising an 
eyebrow, she walked over to the scientist as she heard the door to the 
room open behind her.

&quot;Professor, what&#39;s wrong?&quot; she asked. The professor gave her a worried 
look.

&quot;Tomorrow night&#39;s the final night of the ritual, and we still need a 
sacrifice. We need a girl child without blemish, having never been 
touched by another, and with her virtue intact.&quot;

Beniko frowned. Virgins were generally much harder to find nowadays, and 
just because a girl said she was one was no guarantee of an intact 
hymen. Any young girl who would&#39;ve protected her virtue in today&#39;s age 
was certainly not going to be a willing participant in any sacrificial 
sex rite.

She looked back over to the door, and saw Marika smiling.

&quot;Marika?&quot; she asked, &quot;Could you find us a suitable sacrifice?&quot;

The redhead nodded, tapping the side of her nose as she did so. She had 
her own motives for being involved in all this. Once the Senshi was 
trapped within the magical container, she would reveal her true agenda 
to all.

------

Hotaru walked from the den where Michiru was painting a still life to 
the living room where Haruka was silently watching the news.

&quot;Papa?&quot; she asked, &quot;Is something wrong?&quot;

The blond raised her eyebrow a bit, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

Hotaru sat next to her, &quot;You didn&#39;t talk much after Setsuna-mama and 
Kihomi-sama left. Papa, it may help if you talk about it.&quot;

Haruka gave the Senshi of Death an amused look, &quot;Just when did you 
become the parent?&quot; she quipped. Noticing her daughter&#39;s determined 
look, she sighed. &quot;It&#39;s your Setsuna-mama.&quot; she admitted, &quot;Both her and 
Kihomi looked so happy together when they left, and they seemed serious 
about each other. I guess I worry about what happens if they stay 
together and...&quot;

&quot;And you worry about when Kihomi-sama starts to age, while Setsuna-mama 
stays young?&quot;

Haruka looked at her daughter and marveled at how mature the young woman 
was.

&quot;Papa, they only just started dating. I think it&#39;s a little early to 
worry about things like that, but if and when the time comes to deal 
with it, we&#39;ll all be there for her and Kihomi-sama.&quot;

The blond looked at her daughter in silence for a few seconds before 
rubbing her head and messing up her hair.

&quot;Okay, firefly; you win. We&#39;ll worry about it later. Where&#39;s your 
Michiru-mama?&quot;

&quot;Painting.&quot; Hotaru answered. Haruka flashed her a smile.

&quot;Want to sneak some ice cream before dinner?&quot; the racecar driver asked. 
Hotaru jokingly put her index finger up to her chin as if she was deep 
in thought.

&quot;Hmmm... Make it two scoops?&quot; the girl asked.

&quot;Deal.&quot; the blond said with a smile as the two raced into the kitchen.

---7:10 PM---

Setsuna finished dressing and came out of Kihomi&#39;s bedroom to find the 
teacher leaning up against the wall looking at her.

&quot;What?&quot; the Senshi asked nervously.

The teacher just shook her head as she looked at her, &quot;You&#39;re so 
beautiful, do you know that?&quot;

Setsuna blushed at the compliment. &quot;Thank you.&quot; she muttered. She then 
remembered something. &quot;Kiho-chan, may I use your phone?&quot;

------

Hotaru was on the phone with Usagi when she heard someone trying to get 
in on the other line. Having call holding, she put the blond on hold as 
she switched to the other line.

&quot;Hello.&quot; she answered.

&quot;Hotaru honey? How are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Setsuna-mama? I thought you were out on a date with Saito-sensei.&quot;

&quot;I am, hon. I&#39;m just calling in to check up.&quot;

&quot;Oh. So how&#39;s the date going.&quot;

&quot;Wonderful, hon. How&#39;d your homework go?&quot;

&quot;Okay.&quot; Hotaru answered. She hesitated a bit and then asked, 
&quot;Setsuna-mama, will you be in tonight to say goodnight like you normally 
do?&quot;

There was a few seconds of silence before she finally heard, &quot;Of course, 
hon. I&#39;ll be home around nine.&quot;

After a few more minutes, Setsuna said goodbye and switched back to 
Usagi.

&quot;Sorry about that Odango, but Setsuna-mama was just calling in.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; the future queen asked, &quot;So how&#39;s her date going?&quot;

&quot;From the sounds of it terrific. She&#39;s coming home around nine, and...&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; she asked excitedly, &quot;Wow, I&#39;ve got to call the others. We 
can&#39;t wait to meet her!&quot;

&quot;Usagi wait, I&#39;m not sure she...&quot;

&quot;See you tonight, bye!&quot; Usagi said as she hung up.

------

As Setsuna hung up the phone, she felt her girlfriend&#39;s arms encircle 
her. Smiling, she leaned back into the embrace.

&quot;Nine o&#39;clock?&quot; Kihomi asked. The Senshi turned around so that she was 
facing her.

&quot;Yes, if that&#39;s okay? It&#39;s just to say goodnight to my daughter. It&#39;s 
sort or a tradition we have.&quot;

Kihomi kissed her lightly on her lips, &quot;Of course it&#39;s okay. Meanwhile, 
let me just go into the kitchen and fix us up something.&quot; she said as 
she turned away. Setsuna found her way into the living room and started 
looking through the teacher&#39;s books and film collection. She found a 
large group of DVDs together, and looked at them with interest.

&quot;Kiho-chan?&quot; she asked as she pulled one of the boxes out, &quot;What&#39;s 
this?&quot;

The teacher looked in from the kitchen and smiled, &quot;It&#39;s a fan sub of a 
British sci-fi show. I&#39;m a bit of an otaku for it, I&#39;m afraid. I don&#39;t 
think you&#39;d like it much, though.&quot;

Setsuna looked back at her, &quot;Kihomi, I love you. Anything that interests 
you is interesting to me.&quot;

The teacher blushed warmly at that. After a quick dinner, the two found 
themselves sitting together watching the show.

&quot;So,&quot; Setsuna began, &quot;Does the Doctor always run around with that large 
scarf?&quot;

Kihomi snickered a bit, &quot;Well, this one does. There&#39;s actually been ten 
of them by now. At the end of this episode we&#39;ll go back to your place.&quot;

Setsuna nodded as she watched the program. The Time Senshi found this 
&quot;Dr. Who&quot; fellow fascinating. She felt her partner&#39;s arm around her, and 
smiled as she made a mental note to see the other two chapters of &quot;City 
of Death&quot; when Kihomi came back.

When Kihomi came back. She was leaving tomorrow. The thought suddenly 
sucked all the joy away from her.

&quot;Kiho-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Sets.&quot;

&quot;I... I&#39;m going to miss you.&quot; she said.

&quot;I know.&quot; Kihomi said, &quot;I&#39;ll miss you too. I&#39;ll try to call you from the 
hospital every day. It&#39;ll only be for a little while. And once I know 
what&#39;s happening...&quot;

&quot;You mean once we know.&quot; Setsuna said with a determined tone in her 
voice, &quot;I&#39;m going to be there with you through this.&quot;

Kihomi turned to look into the Senshi&#39;s violet eyes. She leaned over and 
kissed her.

&quot;Thank you, you don&#39;t know how much that means.&quot; she said. As the 
episode ended, the two women left the apartment for Setsuna&#39;s house. The 
drive was spent largely in silence as the city passed them by. As they 
came up to her house, they both saw a few other vehicles parked outside 
in front of the lawn. Setsuna immediately recognized one of them as 
belonging to Usagi and allowed a groan to escape.

&quot;Sets-chan?&quot; Kihomi asked out of concern, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m... afraid that word has reached some of my friends that I&#39;m dating, 
and it looks like curiosity has brought them all over. I&#39;m sorry 
Kiho-chan, they&#39;re all good people and very accepting, but if you don&#39;t 
want to meet any of them tonight I&#39;ll understand.&quot;

Kihomi felt a bit of nervousness at meeting strangers like this, but as 
she parked the car she turned to her girlfriend.

&quot;Sets, for them to come out here like this means they obviously care a 
great deal for you. Of course I&#39;ll meet them.&quot;

------

&quot;It&#39;s up!&quot; the professor announced, his face beaming with pride, &quot;And 
sooner than expected.&quot;

Beniko smiled, &quot;Good. I&#39;ll go and get the others.&quot; she declared. As she 
walked by, Marika turned to watch the way the blonde&#39;s hips moved as she 
walked. She smiled; the woman was so beautiful, so open sexually, so 
talented magically...

And so utterly stupid.

She began to disrobe as the others began to filter over to her and 
walked into the circle.

------

&quot;...And this, of course, is Usagi.&quot; Setsuna said, introducing the blond 
to her girlfriend, &quot;Everyone, this is Saito Kihomi, my... my 
girlfriend.&quot; she said nervously. Kihomi bowed to everyone, flashing her 
best smile as she did so. Almost immediately, she was set upon by Minako 
and Usagi.

&quot;So how long have you been seeing Setsuna?&quot;

&quot;Where did you grow up?&quot;

&quot;Are you really Hotaru&#39;s teacher?&quot;

&quot;Are the two of you getting married?&quot;

Rei and Makoto came up behind the two blonds and put their hands over 
their mouths.

&quot;Let them sit down at least!&quot; Rei yelled as she held her hand over 
Minako&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Yeah Usagi, calm down.&quot; Makoto added. &quot;She just got here, and you 
two...&quot; she was cut off by Kihomi.

&quot;We met three days ago, I was born near the stadium where the Hiroshima 
Tigers play, yes, I really am Hotaru&#39;s teacher, although since Setsuna 
and I am dating now she&#39;ll probably have to be moved to another class, 
and it&#39;s too soon to tell.&quot; she said all in one breath.

Everyone in the room was now looking at Kihomi. Then, Haruka started to 
chuckle. Michiru and Ami joined in, and soon everyone was sharing a good 
laugh.

The laughter was cut short, however, for Rei and Michiru. Michiru looked 
over to Rei, who nodded; she&#39;d felt it too. Haruka, still laughing, 
looked over to see a very serious look in her wife&#39;s eyes and 
immediately guessed at what was wrong.

Setsuna, standing behind Kihomi with her arm draped over her shoulder, 
picked up on the subtle body language as well. She wasn&#39;t sure what do, 
since Kihomi was still here. She was about to suggest that they go walk 
outside for a bit while the others talked, when she felt it.

&quot;Sets-chan?&quot; Kihomi asked as she turned to her girlfriend, &quot;What&#39;s 
wrong? I just felt you shiver.&quot;

&quot;I... It&#39;s nothing, I... I need to go upstairs for a few minutes, hon. 
I&#39;ll be right down, though. I promise.&quot;

Kihomi looked questioningly at her, &quot;Okay.&quot; she said, &quot;I&#39;ll wait for 
you.&quot;

Setsuna felt a second tremor go through her. She turned and ran up the 
stairs. Kihomi turned to see the once smiling faces suddenly looking 
pensive and tense. Michiru, Rei and Haruka were standing together 
discussing something important in low tones as Ami, Hotaru and Minako 
looked on worriedly. The teacher began to feel self-conscious and out of 
place, when Usagi and Makoto both came over.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry if I barraged you with questions when you first came in.&quot; 
Usagi said, &quot;Why don&#39;t we go in the kitchen and talk for a bit until 
Setsuna comes back.&quot; she suggested, hoping to get Setsuna&#39;s date out of 
the room so the others could talk more freely.

Makoto smiled at the blonde&#39;s suggestion, &quot;Usagi&#39;s right.&quot; she said, &quot;I 
can fix us some coffee and... Kihomi-san? Are you okay.&quot;

&quot;No...&quot; the teacher whimpered, &quot;Not here...&quot;

&quot;Kihomi!&quot; Usagi yelled as the woman clutched the sides of her head in 
pain. Rei and the others looked over as the blond and Makoto held the 
other woman trying to calm her, even as the pain continued to intensify.

&quot;Hasten the Manifestation.&quot;

It was happening again. The voices.

&quot;Join us.&quot;

&quot;Join us.&quot;

Except this time, someone else was able to hear them too.

&quot;Usagi, Makoto, get back!&quot; Rei shouted, &quot;Hotaru, close the blinds.&quot; she 
ordered.

&quot;Get back?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;Rei, what...&quot;

&quot;You dare not refuse, you dare not refuse...&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s being attacked!&quot; the Shinto priestess yelled over Kihomi&#39;s 
screams as she pulled an ofuda from her purse.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Haruka asked, caught up in the anxiety of the 
moment.

&quot;Exorcism.&quot; the young priestess answered. &quot;Rin pyou tou sha kai jin 
retsu zai zen! Akuryou taisan!&quot; she shouted as she threw the charm at 
the woman. She watched with the others as it burst and crackled into 
flames before it could reach her. &quot;Kami-sama!&quot; she yelled as blood began 
to once again flow from Kihomi, &quot;Give her strength, Kami-sama,&quot; she said 
as she pulled out a second ofuda for her, &quot;give...&quot;

The priestess was cut off as an invisible force picked her up and 
slammed her against the living room wall, knocking over a table lamp in 
the process. As the teacher&#39;s eyes rolled up into the back of her head, 
she began to slowly rise up off the ground.

&quot;Join us.&quot;

&quot;You dare not refuse.&quot;

&quot;Join us.&quot;

Haruka, who had seen enough, pulled her henshin wand out.

&quot;Uranus planet power, make up!&quot;

The other Senshi in the room quickly followed suit, causing the room to 
become ablaze in lights for a brief period. Meanwhile, a small dot of 
light began to glow in front of Kihomi, growing in size as it got 
closer. A symbol, looking like two arrows with points upwards crossed 
against two circles, a smaller one within a larger one, appeared on her 
forehead as a henshin wand appeared in the ball of light.

&quot;No way!&quot; Jupiter gasped.

&quot;Her?&quot; Neptune asked, stunned, &quot;It was her all this time?&quot;

&quot;No.&quot; Mars answered Neptune, still rubbing her shoulder where she&#39;d 
landed, &quot;Usagi was right all the time; she&#39;s not behind any of this. 
She&#39;s been just as much a victim in all this as you and I have. 
Someone&#39;s trying to control her.&quot;

The woman levitating above the ground was no longer screaming as the 
wand, with a dull ochre orb at the end of it, continued to come closer. 
As it at last touched her chest, she was enveloped in a golden yellow 
light, and her street clothes were replaced by a fuku with a golden 
skirt, a light green bow on her chest and back, and white boots that 
rose to just above the knees.

As everyone stood watching, Kihomi suddenly felt weightless, and her 
pain was no more. She looked in front of her and saw the Sailor Senshi 
she knew from the TV news and papers. She also saw one that she&#39;d never 
seen before, wearing a gold skirt and floating in the air. As she 
watched, she felt herself being lifted upward, even as one of the 
Senshi, a woman with long black hair wearing a red skirt, looked up at 
her in alarm.

&quot;They&#39;re taking her away!&quot; she thought she heard her say, but already 
she sounded so far away as Kihomi, now lighter than air, found herself 
floating above the house as she left her body behind.

------

&quot;Saito-sensei!&quot; Saturn called out, &quot;Saito-sensei!&quot;

&quot;Kihomi, hold on.&quot; Sailor Moon whispered. The Senshi floating above the 
ground before them was giving no indications of even being alive, let 
alone any capability of hearing or comprehending the blond.

&quot;They&#39;re taking her away!&quot; Mars yelled as Kihomi stopped breathing all 
together.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot; Neptune asked, &quot;Whose taking her away?&quot;

Mars gave the aqua-haired beauty a fiery look, &quot;Whoever the bastard is 
behind all this.&quot; she answered, &quot;They&#39;re stealing her soul. We have to 
join together and we have to do it now if we&#39;re going to save her.&quot;

------

Tokyo spread out underneath Kihomi as she continued to fly over the 
landscape. The country was flying by quickly, and she could see the 
seaports before her. She began to slow down as she approached a large 
dilapidated building, falling slowly toward its roof as she did so.

She passed through the roof, and entered a scene out of a horror film. 
There was a large machine within a drawn circle, a second circle with 
men and women cutting themselves with knives as two women had sex on the 
floor in front of them, and a man holding a sword that she recognized 
from her hallucinations last night who seemed to be in control of all 
that was happening.

There was also a triangle, drawn in chalk, with various occult symbols 
written around it. She didn&#39;t understand anything of the nightmare she 
was viewing, but she did know one thing; she was being drawn 
inexplicably toward the triangle. Almost instinctually, she knew she had 
to stay away from it.

------

The eight Senshi circled around Kihomi, joining hands as they all 
focused on the teacher and the dire consequences she now found herself 
in. As they gave their energy willingly to save her, the room began to 
glow.

------

Just as Kihomi was about to enter the triangle, she stopped. One of the 
two women having sex on the floor, a redhead, looked straight at her as 
she floated just outside the barrier, and let out an animalistic roar of 
rage. The teacher had just enough time to note the woman&#39;s forked tongue 
before she felt herself being pulled back up through the roof and over 
the Tokyo skyline. Traveling faster this time, she saw Setsuna&#39;s house 
rushing toward her a split second before she saw the strange woman 
floating above the living room floor surrounded by the Sailor Senshi.

------

Kihomi&#39;s entire body suddenly jerked, then fell to the floor with a 
thud. Ami rushed over and put her fingers to the young woman&#39;s neck in 
order to confirm she was alive. As the others surrounded the unconscious 
woman, Haruka perceived a noise coming from upstairs. Setsuna was back.

This wasn&#39;t going to be pretty.</pre>
