<u>Recalculating
<hr />
</u>
</p>
<p>Rei started up the stairs to the shrine, but Minako plopped herself down at the bottom and moaned, “I’m too tiiired.”</p>
<p>“To walk up some stairs?” Rei paused a few steps up.</p>
<p>“Don’t make it sound so trivial,” Minako whined. “These things are brutal. The elevation change makes me queasy at the top.”</p>
<p>Rei snorted and stepped down to where Minako could see her smirk. “Some athlete you are.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  shut up. What you need is an escalator, an escalator and a muzzle, but  above all an escalator. It would probably improve business at the  shrine.”</p>
<p>“Like I want lazy people loitering around my shrine,” Rei scoffed, choosing to ignore the second recommendation. “Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Carry me,” Minako demanded.</p>
<p>“No. Come on.”</p>
<p>“But what about the favour you owe me, hmmm?”</p>
<p>Rei  stopped in her tracks and Minako mentally pumped her fist victoriously.  “What? You want to redeem it this way?” she asked incredulously.</p>
<p>Minako nodded, liking her spontaneous plan more and more. “Carry me up the stairs and I’ll consider the debt repaid.”</p>
<p>Rei  looked very much like she wanted to protest. Minako was glad the miko  placed such value in her word and honour because next second, she was  shouldering both their schoolbags and clambering onto Rei’s back. She  couldn’t restrain a gleeful, “Yay!” to which Rei grunted gruffly and  started up the lengthy stairway.</p>
<p>What Rei couldn’t figure out,  was why they were friends in the first place. Their relationship seemed  to basically consist of the blonde annoying, accosting and taking  advantage of her whenever the mood struck her. Which it did – often.  Minako had now started singing some infernal, irritating song with her  mouth practically pressed to Rei’s ear. And to make matters worse, Rei  was starting to slow down, her initial, determined pace bowing to  tiring muscles.</p>
<p>It did not go unnoticed, and seemed to warrant a  break in singing to coo, “Ah, is Rei getting tired, too?” Minako  reached around to pinch her cheeks. “I bet her poor little leggies are  starting to ache and her wee skinny arms are hurting all over.”</p>
<p>“Mina . . . ko . . .” Rei growled ominously, the effect slightly ruined by her breathlessness.</p>
<p>“I  bet she wishes she were a star athlete like me.” Minako stroked her  head and fluffed Rei’s bangs – something the standoffish girl would  never have let her do had her hands been free to stop her.</p>
<p>Rei  huffed some excessively expletive sentences, something to the effect  of, “The hell I do. Leave my damn bangs alone.” They were only barely  past halfway, but when they got to the top, Rei resolved to give Minako  a good solid push and watch her roll back down the hard, stone steps.</p>
<p>Oblivious  to this plan and making plans of her own, Minako leaned into the curve  of Rei’s neck and laid a little kiss there, giggling at the flinch.  “You’re not in such bad shape I suppose.”</p>
<p>“<em>What</em> are you –!”</p>
<p>With  a full blown smile, Minako kissed just at the bend of her jaw as well,  lingering on the warm skin. “You’re getting a little red though.” Her  teeth lightly nipped the burning tips of Rei’s ears.</p>
<p>“Stop – you – <em>Cut it out</em>!” Ignoring the burning in her legs, Rei redoubled her efforts to get to the top quickly.</p>
<p>“Just  helping you go faster, Rei. You know – a little encouragement here and  there.” With a devilish laugh she wriggled out of the miko’s hold and  dashed up the last dozen steps. “Wouldn’t want you to collapse, though.  Then I’d feel bad,” she yelled down.</p>
<p>Rei looked up at her quizzically and stumbled up to the top. “Am I supposed to thank you?” she asked acerbically.</p>
<p>“No,  no,” Minako danced off merrily. “No need. But since you didn’t carry me  up all the stairs, I guess you still owe me a favour.”</p>
<p>“<em>Minako!</em>”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Surprisingly,  Minako was all sorts of helpful when it came to pitching in at the  shrine. She occasionally tripped over her broom, sometimes knocked  things over, but usually got the job done without breaking anything. <em>Usually</em> . . .
<p>Grandpa  hadn’t been too thrilled about the small statue the blonde had toppled  over and beheaded in the shrine room during her first week of work.  Minako was thereafter assigned the outdoor jobs – mostly sweeping.</p>
<p>Even  more stunning, Minako didn’t complain. If anything, she seemed to enjoy  the menial labour, which both puzzled and amused Rei. After sweeping  her way down the shrine steps, the jovial blonde would trudge back up,  panting of course, but grinning whenever Rei was standing at the top.  She also took pleasure in sweeping around the grounds, humming and  skipping, her broom strokes swishing in rhythm.</p>
<p>Rei found it . .  . odd, and frequently noticed the corners of her lips creeping upwards  while she watched the carefree girl at work. Cleaning the shrine had  definitely taken a sharp one-eighty from the solitary, near-meditative  routine Rei had always practiced. She usually felt compelled to kill  Yuuichiro if the man ever intruded while she was lost in thought,  performing her chores on autopilot. Being fairly sensitive to Rei’s  moods, Yuuichiro only stopped to chat or ask questions if he was sure  Rei wouldn’t immolate him with a deadly glare. Rei was nearly sure that  Minako could also detect what sort of temper she was in, but Minako  seemed fine with disregarding all grumpiness and intruding with her  bouncy, cheerful presence.</p>
<p>When the chores were finished, they  put everything away and entered the house where part two of their  routine set in. Rei arranged snacks and brought them to her room where  the two of them settled down at the table, spread out their homework,  and studied until Minako had to go home.</p>
<p>Where chores failed to  bother Minako, homework was her ultimate archenemy. She slumped against  the table and whined at the questions she couldn’t answer, got bored  and annoyed Rei to pass the time, and often she gave up and curled up  for a nap on the floor.</p>
<p>“You have got the worst work ethic I’ve ever seen,” Rei muttered to the dozing blonde.</p>
<p>Minako hmmmmed and flipped onto her other side with a sleepy, “Thank you, Sensei . . .”</p>
<p>Rei  absently patted her head and went back to studying derivatives – a  subject that Minako would panic over in a couple days when she realised  a test was coming and she knew nothing. Ah well . . . Rei, of course,  would be there to cram it all into her head the night before and then  remind her to breathe before class.</p>
<p>Rei had never heard of Minako  before the blonde took the seat next to her, but the group of friends  she was part of were known for being incessant jocks and sleazy  partiers. Rei looked down again. For being a skanky drunk by  association, Minako wasn’t living up to the image. At least not at the  moment, making light little snoring noises into her curled hands as she  was. Rei couldn’t really fathom how these two versions of Minako met  and got along. She shook her head and started gathering Minako’s  notebooks and papers together, idly wondering how long it would take  for the party-Minako to get bored of working at a shrine.</p>
<p>Rei  tugged at the sleeve of the t-shirt Minako was wearing. She had taken  to leaving a change of clothes at the shrine so she could get out of  her uniform. Minako had even claimed a corner of Rei’s room as hers,  named it AinoLand, and demanded that Rei pass through customs if she  wanted to enter. Rei’s flat stare had been met with a quirky grin.</p>
<p>The blonde stirred, rolled over and plopped her head in Rei’s lap where she yawned widely.</p>
<p>“Charming,” was Rei’s opinion on her view of Minako’s molars. “You’re supposed to be home by six?”</p>
<p>“Mmmm, yep. Why? What time is it?” Minako sat up.</p>
<p>“Twenty to.” <em>If  she likes being here, I’m fine with that. If she ever wants to leave,  I’m . . . fine . . . with that too. Everything is just . . . fine.</em> “Come on, I’ll walk you to your bus stop.”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
“Skip?” Rei made a dismissive sound. “Tch, how about no.”
<p>“Come on –”</p>
<p>“No.” She returned to her math questions.</p>
<p>“Oh loosen up, Grandma,” the blonde jibed. When in doubt – peer-pressure, she figured.</p>
<p>“Go with one of your friends,” Rei deflected, flipping back in her binder to read her notes.</p>
<p>“You’re my friend,” Minako said simply.</p>
<p>Rei ignored the significance of this statement. “You know what I mean.”</p>
<p>“I know what you <em>think</em> you mean,” she muttered.</p>
<p>The  indignant scowl being shot her way had to go unanswered when a  scrunched note landed at Minako’s feet. With a sigh, she scooped up the  note and gave a grin and a wink to its sender. It took her only seconds  to smooth it out to read, scribble a reply, and fire it back.</p>
<p><em>talk later </em></p>
<p><em>busy now</em></p>
<p>“So,”  Minako returned to the task at hand – convincing water to fall upwards.  No, wait – coercing Rei into having fun. “Skipping math class tomorrow  last period? Yes? Good.”</p>
<p>“No, Minako,” the other girl said sternly.</p>
<p>“Why not?” she whined.</p>
<p>“I’m not a reprobate, I’d like to get into a university, and I really don’t see the point.”</p>
<p>“Oh, pull the stick out,” Minako sighed.</p>
<p>Rei bristled. “There’s no stick! If there was, I’d knock some sense into you!”</p>
<p>“You  are not going to math class tomorrow, Hino Rei,” the blonde said with  conviction. “Either I come drag you out and we make a break for it, or  you meet me outside and we sneak away real quiet-like.”</p>
<p>With a growl, Rei set her pencil down. It seemed she actually had to give this some attention. “Why so desperate to cut class?”</p>
<p>“You mean asides from the <em>obvious</em> reasons?”</p>
<p>“Obvious reasons?”</p>
<p>Minako  grinned in a way that let Rei know something irksome was going to  emerge from the blonde’s lips. “Well, you’re a very attractive girl.  Anyone would love to spend the day with you,” her grin worsened, “and  maybe a night or two.”</p>
<p>“That’s it. I’m not going.” Rei made to turn back to her school work.</p>
<p>“No! I’m – wait! I’m sorry,” Minako said quickly, sitting forward in her chair and trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>“Keh. Of course you are.”</p>
<p>“No, I am. Well, I’m not <em>sorry </em>sorry, but I do take it back if you want me to.” Minako smiled winningly.</p>
<p>“Whatever. Give me a real reason for skipping.” Rei faced the blonde once more. This was her last chance.</p>
<p>For  a moment, Minako said nothing. Then her grin faded into an almost  wistful expression. “Sometimes I . . . get restless. Being here, being <em>motionless</em> . . . makes me feel less and less alive. You know? Do you ever feel  like that?” She wasn’t even looking at Rei now. “You ever feel like if  you don’t start moving you might just die and no one would notice?”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
Rei  would probably glare her to death if she pointed it out, but Minako  could sense the others girl’s guilt at skipping classes. The miko was  also looking distinctly jumpy, checking over her shoulder every now and  then. She only relaxed slightly when they stepped into a small video  arcade.
<p>“We’re skipping to play video games?” Rei asked sceptically.</p>
<p>Minako  scoffed, “Of course not. We’re here to get out of these.” She gestured  at their uniforms. “You brought a change of clothes like I told you?”</p>
<p>Rei  nodded, finally comprehending the blonde’s infinite wisdom, and they  made their way to the back of the arcade to the washrooms, each taking  a stall to dress in. Minako was done first and leaned over a sink to  fix her hair and straighten her clothes in the mirror. Movement in the  corner of the mirror showed Rei standing back to do the same. Minako  paused for a moment to ogle the miko in her street clothes – a  combination of trendy and casual that was tasteful enough to fit her  personality.</p>
<p>They also fit her body really nicely, Minako tried  to note with critical detachment – and failed. She was fairly certain  she had been appreciating the other girl’s legs for long enough to  qualify as staring and shook herself out of it. Looking nervously back  up at Rei’s face, the lack of scowl surprised her. The miko’s  reflection stood with a half grin on her face and a superior tilt to  her head.</p>
<p>Minako didn’t really want to know what Rei was going to  say and turned around to face her with a quick, “Let’s go!” and bolted  out the door.</p>
<p>“Go where?” she heard grumbled from behind her.</p>
<p>Minako waited until the dark haired girl had caught up before latching onto her excitedly and whispering, “Shibuya!”</p>
<p>To  get to the busy shopping district Shibuya required that they take a  train. The blonde bounced in her seat the whole way there. Rei dragged  her off at the right stop and they spent the rest of the afternoon  wandering through busy stores and crowded streets.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly,  Minako was a manic shopper, trying on anything that caught her eye and  insisting that Rei give her opinion. For her part, Rei looked and did  not touch, not terribly in need of clothes nor interested. It was only  due to Minako’s wheedling that she tried on some shirts and ended up  buying one.</p>
<p>At the end of the day they made their way out of the  mad crush of shoppers and headed back the way they came. Minako was  enjoying making seedy prepositions concerning the nearby love hotels  and the clubs that were starting to open up. Rei switched topics as if  she didn’t even hear the blonde.</p>
<p>“Are you taking the train home as well?”</p>
<p>Minako  gave up trying to fluster the calm girl with insinuations and shook her  head. “Just a bus. My house is pretty close. You could come over if you  like,” she offered.</p>
<p>Rei checked the time and shrugged, “I could, but I don’t want Grandpa to start doing my chores. Another time, maybe.”</p>
<p>“Okay. And, Rei?”</p>
<p>Rei  waited, watching a small smile light bright blue eyes. “I’m really glad  you came. I had a lot of fun. I know this isn’t really your thing, but  thank you. It means a lot to-”</p>
<p>“It’s not my thing,” Rei  interrupted, “but I didn’t do it just to please you.” The miko nearly  cringed at how harshly this came out and realised she couldn’t stand to  watch Minako’s expression fall. With little thought preceding the  action, Rei hugged her. Just a short, friendly embrace that ended  before Minako could even reciprocate. “I had fun as well,” Rei murmured.</p>
<p>A  soft goodbye, a small flash of a smile, a hasty retreat . . . and Rei  was nearly half a block away before Minako could function properly  again.</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
“Hey . . .” Minako looked over her manga at Rei, who was lying on her bed studying.
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know that favour you owe me?”</p>
<p>“I do <em>not</em> owe you anything.” Rei fumed, still irritable about the last “favour” she had been forced to perform.</p>
<p>Minako  grinned, crawled over to the bed and knelt next to it, leaned her head  against Rei’s. “I want you to come see one of my games.”</p>
<p>“Good for you,” she muttered.</p>
<p>“I promise not to trick you this time,” Minako offered.</p>
<p>Rei twitched a little at the closeness of Minako’s lips to her ear. “I don’t want to watch volleyball.”</p>
<p>“Why not?” Minako pouted and tugged at a strand of hair.</p>
<p>Rei batted her hand away. “It’s not that I dislike it, I just don’t find it very interesting.”</p>
<p>“Well then you’ve never watched <em>me</em> play.” She leaned even closer to murmur, “I’ll make it <em>very</em> interesting.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure . . .” Rei scoffed quietly. Minako’s nose was touching her cheek and she could feel it when the blonde blinked.</p>
<p>“So you’ll come watch?” Minako asked sweetly, leaning around to peer into Rei’s eyes from up close.</p>
<p>Rei turned her head and huffed, “Fine.”</p>
<p>Minako  cheered and flung herself onto the bed to squeeze Rei in a hug. Rei  grunted and tried to liberate her arms so she could keep working.  Minako ignored the other girl’s struggles. “You can paint your face and  bring a big poster –”</p>
<p>“Keh. Not!” Rei growled at not being able to free herself and reached back to tickle the blonde’s sides.</p>
<p>Minako  wriggled, but maintained her death grip. “Eehaha! And . . . heeheehee .  . . flash the crowd . . . hahahee . . . whenever I score a point!  Ahahahahaha! Stop! Aaah, I let go already! Ahahaheehee!”</p>
<p>But Rei  had flipped their situation around, incapacitating Minako with a  crushing round of tickling that had the blonde at her mercy. By the  time she let up, Minako was limp and dazed, tears running from her eyes  from laughing so much.</p>
<p>“Mahhh,” she mewled weakly, wiping at her eyes.</p>
<p>Rei sat back with a satisfied smirk. “Let that be a lesson, chump.”</p>
<hr />
....
<hr />
“Are you and her, um, are you together?”
<p>“Are we . . . together? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You know . . . I mean you spend a lot of time with each other . . . and I –”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait, you think we’re <em>together</em>?!? What?! No! We’re just – no, we’re hardly even – I don’t like her like that!”</p>
<p>“Oh, alright. I didn’t mean to offend you or upset –”</p>
<p>“Then why the hell would you ask such a stupid question?”</p>
<p>“I . . . well you see, it’s just . . .”</p>
<p>“Out with it, Kumada.”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand why you won’t go out with me.”</p>
<p>“. . . I <em>told</em> you. I don’t like you like that.”</p>
<p>“But  I’m kind to you and polite even when you’re mean to me! I work extra  hard just so you’ll notice me. It’s been a year and a half now . . .”</p>
<p>“. . .”</p>
<p>“So I thought maybe you weren’t into guys . . .”</p>
<p>“You’re an idiot.”</p>
<p>“I guess . . .”</p>
<p>“And really cocky!”</p>
<p>“Sorry . . .”</p>
<p>“How much more conceited can you get!? Just because I don’t like you I must not like men? That is so arrogant! As if <em>you’re</em> the greatest male specimen around.”</p>
<p>“I am in a band . . .”</p>
<p>“We’re friends, Yuuichiro. I like you but I . . .”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“. . . I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>“No, I apologise. I shouldn’t have assumed or tried to pressure you. I . . . is there a chance you might change your mind?”</p>
<p>“ . . . I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Alright. See you later, Rei.”</p>
<p>“Bye . . . Yuuichiro.”</p>
<hr />

<hr />
After  school on Tuesday found Rei seated in the bleachers of the main gym,  leaning back on her elbows propped against the row behind her. The  stands were being slowly filled by the trickle of students entering to  watch the senior girl’s volleyball team continue their winning streak.
<p>Rei had been debriefed <em>at length</em> on the team’s ongoing stretch of victories orchestrated and carried out  by their fabulous team captain. Then Rei had only half listened as  Minako started into a description of the team formation and her  position. The numbers 5-1 kept coming up and the word <em>setter</em>, which Rei had only a vague notion of.</p>
<p>The  team was warming up on the court in preparation, running through  drills, looking very organised and energetic. Minako’s bounding stride  and flashing blonde hair was unmistakeable even at a distance, not that  Rei’s seat was too far back. The team captain found the dark haired  girl easily in the crowd and paused to give a wide smile and wave.</p>
<p>Rei  wasn’t about to make an ass of herself and wave back, but two girls  seated in front of her, thinking the acknowledgement was being aimed at  them, were more than willing to return the gesture. Minako just  grinned, keeping eye contact with Rei, and returned her attention to  the court. Rei pondered the possibility of sneaking out now that Minako  had seen her, but was distracted by the start of a conversation in  front of her.</p>
<p>“I thought she didn’t like you anymore,” the girl on the left said to her friend.</p>
<p>The  other girl shrugged. “She’s probably just being nice. Besides, I heard  she’s totally into someone else – some girl no one knows.”</p>
<p>Rei  tensed and stared holes into the backs of their heads while the two  girls continued chatting. “Wait, what about that guy she was seeing?  What’s-his-name . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh, their break up was like, weeks ago. Where have you been?”</p>
<p>“Umm, not spreading gossip?”</p>
<p>“Whatever. So anyway, you’ll never guess who hooked up at Akio’s party last weekend . . .”</p>
<p>The miko sat back and tuned their chatter out, trying to ignore the suspicions niggling at her with aggravating persistence. <em>Yeah  right. It’s not what you’re thinking – you don’t even know if she’s  like that. You don’t even know if these two bimbos are telling the  truth.</em></p>
<p>But the niggling suspicions brought reinforcements. <em>“I think I’ve found someone better . . .”</em> Minako told Rei , her eyes on the leaves she was sweeping. <em>“I mean you spend a lot of time with each other . . .”</em> Yuuichiro pointed out. And he was right. It was rare for her to be  around someone so much. Most people gave up when they realised she  really was as distant as she acted.</p>
<p>Rei rubbed the back of her neck and tried to reason it all away with logic. <em>You know how determined she can be. She didn’t give up because she’s stubborn.</em> The miko froze when she realised she was massagingthe part of her neck  that the blonde had molested with her lips just a couple weeks ago.</p>
<p><em>Explain that. </em></p>
<p>She dropped her hand back into her lap.</p>
<p><em>And  explain the way she looks at you when she thinks you’re not paying  attention – you know the look. Or how about the fact that she seems to  have nothing but free time to spend with you. If she was after anyone  else–</em></p>
<p>Rei sighed. <em>Bah! Enough already! There’s no point in stressing over it – it’s not like it’s of any importance.</em></p>
<p>The  visiting team was entering the gym now and the game looked to be  underway at last. The miko sat up straight and blocked out the part of  her mind that would not change its opinion.</p>
