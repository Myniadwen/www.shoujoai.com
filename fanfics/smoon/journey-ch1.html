<h1>The Journey Home</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sailordoc.html">Sailor Doc</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The journey home no longer seemed that far, Ami mused, as she walked 
down the dampened sidewalk. She seemed oblivious to the slowly 
drizzling rain and overcast sky, but a sudden flash of lightening with 
it&#39;s accompanying clap of thunder brought a sweet and dreamy smile to 
her face.

&#39;Makoto,&#39; she thought.

She was no longer surprised by the blush she could feel covering her 
cheeks. She was, however, amused that even after all this time just 
the thought of her lover could still make her feel shy.

It was four years now since they had first gotten together. She 
laughed quietly to herself as she remembered all the wistful looks and 
shy words they had shared back then. Any excuse to touch had been a 
good one; an arrant lock of hair, a piece of lent, a stray eye lash. 
Cookie crumbs on each other cheeks had been an especial favorite of 
them both.

&quot;No wonder you were always baking all those cakes and cookies,&quot; Ami 
had accused her later, after they had begun to date.

&quot;Yeah, ya got me on that one,&quot; Makoto had said with a grin. &quot;Of course 
back then I couldn&#39;t brush them off your cheeks the way I really 
wanted to.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Ami had asked. &quot;And how was that?&quot;

&quot;With my lips,&quot; had been the whispered response as Makoto had 
proceeded to lean forward and dust her lips and cheeks with 
feather-light kisses, her touch as soft and gentle as her whispered 
breath had been...

Sighing at the sweet memory, Ami smiled and picked up her pace a bit. 
With the frenzied rush her life had become since she had entered 
medical school, the journey home had become a welcome part of her busy 
schedule. It gave her time. Time to think about personal things that 
didn&#39;t come out of textbooks, lecture halls, cadaver labs and patient 
studies. As important as those things were and as fascinating as she 
found them, they could never infringe on that special place in her 
heart that belonged to Makoto and Makoto alone.

Time. Such a deceptively small word, she mused.

Time had become their enemy for awhile. With the beginning of college 
for Ami and entrance into the first of many cooking schools for 
Makoto, they had started to find it increasingly difficult to find any 
time at all, much less quality time to spend together. The added 
responcibilies of additional study, after-school labs, research 
papers, catered affairs, and senshi duties had put a tremendous amount 
of strain on their relationship. After many stress induced 
misunderstandings and arguments, which included both tears and 
accusations, they had come to the realization that they were not each 
others problem. Time was their common enemy. With the root of the 
problem established they were able to seek out the advice of a 
professional...and who could be better than the guardian of time 
herself? Ami grinned as she remembered the look on Setsuna&#39;s face when 
both she and Makoto had shown up on her doorstep for &#39;marriage 
counseling&#39;! She had invited them into the living room with a knowing 
smile and after returning a few minutes later with a fresh pot of tea, 
proceeded to show them how to make time work for, not against them. 
Since then, each new day, no matter how hectic it may be, had been an 
adventure they could share. They faced each new challenge together, 
and what a rush it had been!

The wind picked up a bit and Ami, grateful for the raincoat Makoto had 
insisted she take that morning, huddled under her umbrella and watched 
the approaching bus with relief. The familiar screech of the air 
brakes and splash of the large tires were almost as welcome a sound as 
the swish of the large folding door as it opened to invite her out of 
the cold and damp. Paying her fare and taking a seat close to the 
front, Ami continued to think of their war against time.

After their initial &#39;session&#39; with Setsuna things had improved 
greatly, however the decisive blow had been dealt two years ago.

It had happened one night as Ami was once again preparing to return 
home for the night. It had become a part of their established routine 
to spend their evenings together, no matter where that may be. 
Sometimes it would be at the library or lab of Ami&#39;s school, and at 
other times, the back of some strange restaurant where Mako had gotten 
a chance to study under the direct guidance of some famous chef. More 
often than not though, it would be at Makoto&#39;s apartment where they 
would both &#39;hunker down&#39; to their books in a deadly serious attempt to 
better their future. However...being young and in love did make for 
some rather interesting distractions. It may have been an old joke, 
but Mako never tired of reminding Ami that if she really wanted to be 
a good doctor, the on-going study of human anatomy was very 
important...and she would always be willing, even eager, to help! 
Smiling secretly to herself, Ami couldn&#39;t stop the rush of memories 
that came to her as she thought about all the nights they had spent in 
the privacy of their own special anatomy lab, where &#39;the joys of 
learning&#39; took on a whole new meaning...

Ami sighed as she watched the people walking down the sidewalks from 
the comfort of her seat, her thoughts on her partner.

As a lover, Makoto was...amazing. Of course her experience before 
Makoto was limited. Okay, it was nonexistent! But honestly, she 
couldn&#39;t even begin to imagine that anyone else could satisfy her 
more. Truthfully, she really couldn&#39;t see anyone else in that 
capacity. The people in her life fell into groups; her family, her 
friends, her acquaintances, her co-workers, and Makoto, who was in a 
class all by herself. She was best friend and lover, as well as 
critic, cheering squad, guardian and advocate. As a partner, she was 
supportive, encouraging and always interested in her progress. As a 
lover, she was tender and giving, yet she carried an underlying 
passion that held her captive and took her breath away every time. She 
had heard of two people becoming &#39;as one&#39;, but it truly seemed to her 
that in those special moments, Makoto really was a part of her. Not 
just on a physical level, but a spiritual one as well.

With a slight shiver that had nothing whatsoever to do with her rain 
dampened shoes and feet, Ami forced her thoughts to return to the 
night, just a little over two years ago, when the time issue had been, 
if not solved, at least contained.

They had again spent the evening at Makoto&#39;s, where they had gotten a 
lot accomplished with their respective studies and had even had time 
to spare for &#39;anatomy lab&#39;, but as inevitably happened, the time came 
for Ami to return to her mother&#39;s house. With the passage of time, 
this had started to become more and more difficult.

&quot;Don&#39;t go,&quot; Makoto had whispered, her breath tickling Ami&#39;s ear 
gently. &quot;Stay the night,&quot; she had said, her arms intimately entangled 
around Ami, who clung to her in like fashion at the front door of the 
apartment.

With a soft growl of frustration their lips came together again, the 
desire to stay and the need to leave playing out their war on the 
battleground of the young lovers desire.

&quot;I can&#39;t,&quot; Ami groaned as she tried to be strong and pull away from 
her lovers determined lips.

&quot;Why?&quot; Makoto had asked quickly before launching another assault, this 
time on Ami&#39;s sensitive neck and ear.

Ami&#39;s eye&#39;s had rolled in pleasure before she was forced to close them 
by the re-awakening fire that she had really only just banked a few 
minutes before. Tightening the grip she had on her lover, she could 
feel herself giving in to the desire that was never really that far 
away when they were together.

&quot;Ami-love,&quot; the whispered endearment burned into her consciousness.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; she had pleaded, her body trembling with her re-awakened 
need. &quot;Please, baby...you&#39;re making this so hard...&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Makoto had said, her pleading eyes locked on Ami&#39;s blue 
ones. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to leave! I don&#39;t ever want you to leave!&quot;

The moment had seemed frozen in time.

In that one instance they both seen the &#39;hand-writing on the wall&#39;, 
and Ami had gotten an un-obstructed view of Makoto&#39;s lonely heart. 
Gazing up into that beloved face with it&#39;s frame of reddish-brown 
hair, still disheveled from their earlier passion, she was struck by 
the fear she saw buried there in those beautiful, deep green eyes.

&quot;Mako,&quot; she had whispered, raising her hand to caress the cheek of her 
suddenly silent thunder senshi. &quot;Sweetheart, what&#39;s wrong ?&quot;

&quot;I...uh...,&quot; she stammered after a few moments. Then she had 
swallowed, and pulling away from their embrace said, &quot;you&#39;ll think 
it&#39;s silly.&quot;

Frowning slightly, Ami replied, &quot;I don&#39;t think I could find anything 
&#39;silly&#39; that affects you like this.&quot; As Makoto had started to turn 
away, Ami had reached out to stop her, her grip on Makoto&#39;s arm firm 
and determined. &quot;I&#39;m serious Makoto,&quot; she&#39;d said softly. &quot;Talk to me.&quot;

The air conditioner chosen that moment to cycle back off and the room 
was still as Ami waited, giving her lover time to collect her 
thoughts.

&quot;Ami,&#39; she began a few moments later, her voice strained. &quot;I&#39;m tired. 
I&#39;m just so damn tired of...of...,&quot; Ami watched as she clinched her 
jaw and stared up at the ceiling for several seconds before lowering 
her head once more to continue softly &quot;...of being alone.&quot;

They could hear the wall clock ticking in the next room. They really 
didn&#39;t care.

&quot;I&#39;ve spent so much of my life alone, staring at the four walls of 
this damn apartment. I guess I&#39;m just sick and tired of coming home 
knowing I&#39;ll be spending yet another night alone, in the dark, by 
myself, in the cold, without another soul to give a damn whether I 
even wake up in the morning or not.&quot;

Ami started forward in violent protest, stopped only by Makoto&#39;s 
gentle hand on her forearm.

&quot;I know what you&#39;re going to say,&quot; she continued, a sad smile on her 
face, &quot;and I love you for it! But, you asked me what was wrong and 
this is it. This is how I feel, and the fact remains that even though 
I know you love me, you still have to leave me most every night. 
It...,&quot; she swallowed painfully. &quot;It still hurts.&quot;

Ami was quiet, her thoughts spinning through her mind like a 
whirlwind. Finally, in a quiet voice she had asked, &quot;what do you want 
me to do?&quot;

Looking into her eyes with a seriousness Ami had never seen before, 
Makoto stated firmly, &quot;I want you to stay. Here. With me. Period.&quot;

They had gazed at each other for a bit, weighing the gravity of the 
moment. Then, without another word, Ami had walked to the phone, 
picked it up and dialed.

&quot;Hello, mom?...yeah, its me...yeah, I know it&#39;s pretty late, sorry! 
Are you okay?...that&#39;s great!...Look, I think I&#39;ll be staying 
here...no, no, she&#39;s fine...no, really!...no, it&#39;s not that...MOM!&quot; 
Ami blushed a fiery red as she clinched the receiver in her hand. 
&quot;Kami-sama, mom! I can&#39;t believe you said that!&quot; Ami had looked at 
Makoto, turned even redder and quickly cut her eyes away from her. 
&quot;Geez, mom...no...no, that&#39;s not it really. It&#39;s just. Well. Makoto 
needs me.&quot;

Makoto had watched the one-sided conversation in wonder and 
fascination. Was what she thought was happening really happening?

&quot;Yeah, I guess it&#39;s time...yeah...yeah...,&quot; a small smile quirked her 
lips as she listened to her mom on the other end. &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll talk 
about it sometime this weekend...uh-huh...yeah...I love you too, 
mom...good night.&quot;

Ami returned the receiver to it&#39;s cradle, and turned to face her 
partner.

&quot;I&#39;m home,&quot; she&#39;d said with a gentle smile. She offered her open arms 
to Makoto, who came forward eagerly into her welcoming embrace...

Gazing once again out the bus window, Ami never noticed the two cab 
driver arguing at the intersection. All she saw was the glorious rays 
of the sun as they began to break through the oppressive cloud cover. 
With a happy grin, she thought of her life since that night.

Once the decision had been made, events had moved pretty swiftly. By 
the end of the next week, Ami had been officially moved into &#39;the 
apartment formerly known and Makoto&#39;s&#39;. An apartment warming party had 
been thrown by their friends and fellow senshi to everyone&#39;s fun and 
enjoyment. Haruka had simply said, &quot;About time,&quot; to Michiru&#39;s 
amusement, and Setsuna, in her own special if enigmatic way had merely 
smiled and said, &quot;a most excellent use if time management. I 
congratulate you both!&quot;

Since then life had been, if not perfect, then darn near close. Sure, 
they&#39;d had their tiffs form time-to-time as most couples do, but for 
the most part the move had strengthened their relationship. After all, 
as Makoto had said one time, &quot;how can I stay mad at you for forgetting 
to clean the bathroom when I come home and find you fast asleep, face 
down on your textbooks?&quot; Ami remembered how touched she had been by 
Makoto&#39;s sentiment until she had gone and ruined it...&quot; Besides...I 
find the drool- pool on that page just way too sexy...&quot; Embarrassed, 
Ami had made her pay! Oh yeah, she had paid for that one! But still, 
the truth was they both worked hard, and true love had a way of 
deciding what was really important, as well as what was not.

On the anniversary of their first year together in the apartment, Ami 
had come home to discover an apartment where only candles provided the 
lighting. Fresh flowers decorated a table elegantly set for two and if 
the aroma was any indication, the food would be as tasteful and 
wonderful as it looked. As Ami looked in amazement at the scene in 
front of her, she became aware of movement to her right. As she 
watched, Makoto entered the room with a quiet smile.

&quot;Hey,&quot; She&#39;d said softly. &quot;Welcome home!&quot;

Her dress was cocktail length and black, with french sleeves and a 
sweetheart neckline. It gracefully covered her curves and seemed to 
bring out the subtle lights of her reddish-brown hair. She wore light 
make-up, with her trademark rose earrings and a simple diamond 
pendant, a gift from her parents on her ninth birthday, adorned her 
neck.

Stunned, Ami stood there unable to think.

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Makoto asked shyly.

Jolted from her catatonic state, Ami had uncharacteristically blurted, 
&quot;Yes!&quot; As she&#39;d seen Makoto&#39;s smile, she&#39;d said, &quot;This is wonderful! I 
can&#39;t believe you went to all this trouble. Oh Mako, it&#39;s absolutely 
beautiful! And you,&quot; She swallowed, tears coming to her eyes as her 
voice came in a whisper. &quot;You take my breath away.&quot;

Makoto had taken her in her arms and gently kissed her lips. Are you 
hungry?&quot; she asked with a sexy smile.

&quot;Uh-huh,&quot; Ami had managed in a daze.

&quot;Then hurry up and get dressed!&quot; She&#39;d teased.

After a quick change into something better suited for the importance 
of the evening, Ami had returned to share the wonderful meal her Mako 
had prepared for them. As great as it was, she just couldn&#39;t take her 
eyes off of her beautiful partner. It was funny, she mused, that while 
others may call her plain, to her, Makoto was beauty itself. But then 
she knew she saw Mako through the eyes of love and as such, she would 
always be perfection to her.

At the end of the meal, Makoto had given her a glass of champagne and 
offered a toast.

&quot;To us, and our first year together. May it be the first of many, many 
more,&quot; she&#39;d said, her eyes sparkling in the candlelight.

&quot;Hear, hear...,&quot; Ami had quickly agreed and together they had touched 
glasses, entwined their arms and drank to seal the toast.

&quot;Here,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;I have something for you.&quot;

Ami frowned. &quot;Makoto! I thought we agreed to hold off on gifts except 
for birthdays and Christmas until we&#39;re out of school.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right Ami, we did. But,&quot; she gave a sly little grin, &quot;I lied!&quot;

&quot;Makoto! Sweetheart, I didn&#39;t get you anything!&quot; Ami wailed.

&quot;Sh-h-h! Don&#39;t worry about it, love! You may not even like this old 
thing,&quot; she said as she produced a small black box from behind her 
back.

Ami had looked at that tiny black box in Makoto&#39;s outstretched hand 
like it was the most fascinating thing she had ever seen...but was 
afraid it might bite her!

&quot;Go on,&quot; Makoto had encouraged her, an eager twinkle in her eyes. 
&quot;Open it.&quot;

With trembling hand, Ami had reached out and taken the box. Eyes wide, 
she had opened the hinged lid and could not avoid the tiny gasp that 
escaped her lips or the tears that began to slowly slide down her 
cheeks.

Inside was a ring. A sturdy-looking gold band that was set with 
several channel cut emeralds cut in the shape of lightening bolts.

&quot;Oh Makoto,&quot; Ami whispered. It was all she could manage as Makoto had 
gently taken her left hand. Kissing her ring finger, Makoto had looked 
deeply into her eyes, said &quot;Forever,&quot; and slipped the ring into 
place...

Ami looked down at her hand and smiled as the emerald lightening bolts 
winked back at her. Lost in her thoughts of that special night, she 
almost missed her stop and hurried to gather her things. As she exited 
the bus, she became aware of the fresh breeze and the smell of the 
rain-washed pavement. She couldn&#39;t help but smile again.

She was almost home.

Tonight would also be a special night. It was two years now since they 
had first moved in together, and this time she was prepared. As the 
elevator took her to their floor, she ran down her list. This time she 
would be ready, and she had told Makoto so as well.

1-A cousage of fresh, pink orchids would be delivered at 6:20pm.
2-Haruka would pick them up in a limo at 6:40pm.
3-They had reservations at Makoto&#39;s all-time favorite restaurant at 
7:00pm.
4-Minako-chan would enter the apartment with two dozen red roses to 
decorate their room at 8:00pm, (or else!)
5-They would return home by 9:00pm.
6-After that...well...

Entering their bedroom, Ami walked to the closet to check out her new 
dress. Cut in the classical style, it was evening length and perfectly 
matched the sparkling sapphire-blue of her eyes...as well as something 
else...she hoped Makoto would approve.

Later that night when they at last returned home, Ami couldn&#39;t have 
been more happy with the way the evening had progressed. Everything 
had gone off as planned. Makoto had loved the beautiful pink orchids! 
Haruka had been there at 6:40pm on the very dot, complete with black 
uniform and chauffeurs cap! Ami had laughed, not knowing she would go 
that far, but Haruka had explained that Michiru would never let her 
set foot outside the house without being properly attired for any 
event! The restaurant was lovely and a quick glance inside their room 
confirmed that Minako-chan had done her job, and done it well...love 
senshi that she was!

That left only one last thing.

&quot;So,&quot; Ami began. &quot;Did you enjoy yourself tonight?&quot;

&quot;How could I not,&quot; Makoto exclaimed, her happiness evident in her 
sparkling eyes. &quot;It was a perfect evening and I love you for sharing 
it with me.&quot;

Ami smiled brightly at her words and answered, &quot;I love you to Mako, so 
very much, but there&#39;s still one last little bit of business we have 
to take care of before we can retire for the evening.&quot;

Makoto moved forward to take the smaller girl in her arms. &quot;Are you 
sure it can&#39;t wait until morning, Ami-love,&quot; Makoto whispered softly 
in her ear as she began to trail kisses in a firm, but gentle line 
down the side of her neck.

Swallowing convulsively as she felt her heart-rate increase, Ami stuck 
to her convictions and gently pulled away.

&quot;No...I mean YES, I&#39;m sure it can&#39;t wait,&quot; she said as Makoto grinned 
at her momentary confusion.

&quot;Okay love,&quot; Makoto said, putting forth the effort to get serious 
again. &quot;What&#39;s so important it can&#39;t wait, tonight of all nights?&quot;

&quot;This,&quot; Ami said, holding out a small black box. &quot;It&#39;s my turn.&quot;

Stunned, Makoto stared at the tiny black box, then smiled. &quot;I guess I 
really shouldn&#39;t be all that surprised,&quot; she said. &quot;So, is this a case 
of &#39;turnabout being fair play&#39;?&quot;

&quot;You know it!&quot; Ami responded, a large grin spreading across her 
adorable face. &quot;Now here! Take this thing before I drop it or 
something!&quot;

Reaching out, Makoto took the tiny box in her hand and cracked it 
open. With her first glance inside, her other hand involuntarily went 
to her mouth to cover the sobs as she gazed at it&#39;s contents.

It was, of course, a ring. A sturdy-looking gold band that was set 
with several channel cut sapphires all cut in the shape of icicles, 
very closely resembling the lightening bolts on Ami&#39;s own ring.

She was speechless. All she could do was stare at the ring, her mind 
and spirit moved by the beauty of not the ring itself, but what it 
symbolized.

&quot;Do you like it?&quot; Ami asked, breaking the silence of the room.

&quot;Oh Ami,&quot; was all Makoto could manage. &quot;My Ami-love.&quot;

With that charming, quiet smile that was all her own, Ami stepped 
forward and took Makoto&#39;s left hand. Kissing her ring finger, Ami 
captured Makoto&#39;s eyes with her own, trying desperately to say with 
them all they were both too moved to say with words. &quot;Forever,&quot; she 
whispered, and slipped the ring into place.

And so it was.

The journey home was now, and forever, complete.
