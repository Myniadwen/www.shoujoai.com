<h1>And the Desert Roars (part 6 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/desertroars-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>The streets of the bazaar were empty, the only guests rats and 
moonlight.

And a dark being, clad black rodes, limping down the street. Shadows 
shifted around it. Light never touched it as the malice it produced was 
stiffiling.

&quot;Hey there,&quot; a thug chuckled as he stepped from the darkness. &quot;Why don&#39;t 
ya give me your gold? Or I&#39;ll bleed you dry.&quot; He lifted a knife. &quot;What&#39;s 
it gonna be?&quot;

The figure stared at him. He was attractive. Shaggy brown her. Muscled 
body. He was young, it noted. Ripe.

Perfect.

The figure advanced slowly. The thug placed his knife in front of him. 
&quot;Stay back!&quot; he growled. The figure smirked underneath its cloak.

&quot;Do you believe in ghosts?&quot; it rasped.

&quot;Bah!&quot; He spat on the ground. &quot;Superstitious bull-shit! I don&#39;t have 
time for that!&quot; A skeletal hand grabbed his throat and smashed him 
against the wall. Lifted him up.

Left his feet to dangle.

&quot;Wh-what?!&quot; he shrieked. Red eyes glowed from beneath the hood.

&quot;You&#39;d best start believing in ghosts my friend.&quot; it hissed. The figure 
reached up a second hand and pulled away the hood, revealing its face.

He screamed.

The creature was horrific. Rotten skin pulled tight agains a lupine 
skull. Jagged, yellow fangs curled over its blacked lips. Wisps of hair 
clung to its scalp. Red irises glowed from sunken eyes. Torn canine ears 
twitched at his screams.

&quot;You&#39;d best start believing in ghosts,&quot; it repeated as it leaned for his 
neck. &quot;because you&#39;re about to die from one.&quot;

He screamed again and reached into his shirt. He pulled out a silver 
cross and closed his eyes. Began to pray.

&quot;Our Father, who art in Heaven, hallow be thy name,&quot;

The creature paused.

&quot;Thy kingdom come, thine will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven,&quot;

He was interupted by a shrill screech, like nails on a chalkboard. &#39;It&#39;s 
laughing.&#39; he thought dimly. The creature stopped its laughter and 
grinned, saliva dripping from its mouth.

&quot;Your Gods cannot save you.&quot; it hissed as it ripped the cross away and 
threw it to the ground. &quot;not anymore.&quot;

&quot;Have mercy!&quot; he begged, tears streaming from his eyes. The creature 
paused. &quot;No.&quot;

With that, it sank its fangs into his throat.

And began to drink...

:::---:::

Ami stopped breathing as soon as she realized that she was back in her 
apartment, clutching a dusty lamp and being held by the genie.

Makoto grunted and released her arm, choosing instead to gently lower 
the still glowing sarcoghagus to the ground.

&quot;Okay sleeping beauty,&quot; Makoto murmured. &quot;time to get up.&quot; With that, 
she pushed the lid off. Makoto smirked and dusted off her hands.

Ami shrieked. &quot;W-What do you think you&#39;re doing!?&quot;

Makoto reached into the gold coffin. &quot;Saving the world.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re disturbing the dead!!&quot;

Then, the genie pulled out a woman.

Long, blonde hair drifted to the floor, and weary blue eyes stared at 
the genie. &quot;What has happened?&quot; she croaked.

Ami&#39;s jaw dropped. She was expecting a shriveled piece of human beef 
jerky! Not a perfectly normal, teenage girl that wasn&#39;t decayed in 
anyway shape or from.

The girl closed her eyes. &quot;She has awakened has she not?&quot;

Makoto set the girl down to her feet, bowed, and said in a sad voice, 
&quot;I&#39;m afraid so.&quot;

The blonde hiccuped once, fell to her knees.

And cried...

:::---:::

&quot;It took us a long time,&quot; Haruka began as she led Setsuna to another 
tent. &quot;But according to the ancient scrolls, you had a lover correct? A 
lover that was...killed?&quot;

Setsuna winced. &#39;Minako...&#39;

Haruka paused and looked over her shoulder. When the Magi saw they 
misery in the garnet orbs, she frowned in sympathy and sighed. &quot;My 
lady,&quot; she murmured. &quot;Did you love her?&quot;

Setsun glared. What kind of question was that!? &quot;Magi,&quot; she growled. 
&quot;Speak your business. I have spells to weave and potions to prepare.&quot;

&quot;For the Cursed One?&quot;

&quot;What in the seven hells do you think?&quot;

Haruka flinched slightly. Though the One of Magicks wasn&#39;t at her full 
power, the sorceress could strip the flesh from her bones if need be. 
She coughed and opened the flap.

&quot;I believe we have found something.&quot; the blonde murmured.

Setsun glared at Haruka and stepped into the tent.

What she saw made her gasp. &quot;It can&#39;t be,&quot; she whispered.

Minako smiled gently. &quot;Long time no see eh love?&quot; 

::::---::::

Ami gently poked Usagi&#39;s cheek. Once. Twice.

Usagi frowned and swatted the offending digit away. &quot;Please,&quot; she 
groaned. &quot;I am indeed real. No need to prod.&quot;

&quot;I still can&#39;t believe it,&quot; Ami whispered as she slumped into her 
armchair. &quot;This is impossible.&quot;

&quot;Oh, its possible alright.&quot; Makoto replied. She sat across from Ami, 
clad in jeans and a forest green t-shirt. &quot;Now, about your lifetime of 
wishes--&quot;

&quot;Whoa whoa whoa!&quot; the teacher wailed. &quot;Lifetime!? I thought it was only 
three?&quot; Makoto arched an eyebrow.

&quot;Who told you that ?&quot; she asked. Ami pointed at the T.V. that sat in the 
corner. Makoto looked at the box, then at Ami again. &quot;Listen hon&#39;, 
genies can grant you whatever wish you want, and can grant you how many 
wishes you desire.&quot;

&quot;But, when does it end?&quot; Usagi asked quietly. Makot remained silent, 
then said, &quot;Until the current master dies, the lamp is rubbed by someone 
else, or the master wishes the genie free.&quot; She grinned humorlessly and 
waved a gold band in the air. &quot;Bet you can guess how many times that&#39;s 
happened.&quot;

Ami stared, then looked at the lamp in her lap. &#39;Any wish I desire? An 
unlimitless supply of wishes? It&#39;s so tempting.&#39; Then she looked at 
Makoto.

She took in everything. The long brown hair. The athletic build. Those 
beautiful jade green eyes that made her heart leap. Her smile, the way 
she laughed, that slightly perverted nature; it all made her Makoto oh 
so perfect.

&#39;I don&#39;t believe it,&#39; Ami whispered in her mind. &#39;I&#39;ve fallen for her 
already...&#39; She looked back at the lamp.

&#39;I can set her free...but...will she stay with me?&#39;

It didn&#39;t matter whether Makoto decided to stay or not.

Ami wanted her happy.

Ami wanted her free.

&quot;Makoto,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I wish...&quot; The room was suddenly very quiet. 
&quot;I wish...&quot;

Ami looked up and caught her genie&#39;s eyes. &quot;I wish you were free.&quot; Those 
green eyes widened for a spilt second, before a wave of green energy 
surrounded Makoto&#39;s body. Ami shielded her eyes and felt Usagi grab onto 
her arm. 

::----:::

Rei paused and lifted her head from her third victim&#39;s neck. Blood was 
smeared over her lips, dribiling down her chin. The canine features were 
gone, replaced by her human face. No more rotted flesh. No more cripled 
bones. She was regenerated; reborn.

A strong wave of energy tickled the edges of her mind, familiar.

A maniacal grin twisted her face and malice poured from her body.

&#39;Oh Usa...&#39; she taunted in her mind and she licked her lips. &#39;I found 
you...&#39;

::::: fin :::::

A/N: Yes, I have made Rei the bad-guy. (dodges projectiles) But hey, 
this makes it a bit more angsty no? (mueheheheheheheh.)</pre>
