<h1>My Serenity</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/billk.html">Bill K.</a><br> </h2>
<pre>For all those familiar only with the English dub: 

Usagi=Serena 
Ami=Amy 
Rei=Raye 
Makoto=Lyta 
Minako=Mina 
Haruka=Amara 
Michiru=Michelle 
Setsuna=Trista 
Mamoru=Darian 
Chibi-Usa=Rini  

Finally, Haruka and Michiru are NOT cousins! 

------------------------------------------------------------ 	

The heat in the room seems almost inhuman, and yet I can&#39;t say  that 
I&#39;m uncomfortable.  My attention, though, is occupied elsewhere,  
namely a ruddy strip of flesh between the legs of my sovereign and my  
savior - - and my best friend.

Serenity groans from my ministrations - - that sweet, shy  little 
groan that she keeps bottled up until she can&#39;t stand it any  longer.  
It&#39;s as if she&#39;s afraid, even after all these years, that  someone 
will mock her for feeling pleasure.  Her supple body tries to  squirm 
away, but I hold her thighs with my arms and continue to  stroke the 
strip of flesh with my tongue.  This strip, this pathway  to her 
passion tufted with gold, parts as I push my tongue inside.   Just 
enough to tease, just enough to make her wiggle, then withdraw  to 
make her need more.  She groans again, this time in frustration,  and 
calls me cruel - - and I am.  I could never be truly cruel to her  - - 
never - - but I must confess I love being playfully cruel to her.

The tip of my tongue jabs her clitoris and playfully circles  the shy 
little nub.  Air hisses through Serenity&#39;s parted teeth and I  feel 
every muscle in her body clench.  Peeking up at her, I see her  arms 
fly up to her head and wrap around it.  It gives me a grin.   I&#39;ve 
been on the receiving end of toe-curlers like this and I&#39;m glad  I 
could give one to her.  She begins to cry out, denying what she  felt 
in an effort to mitigate it.  Her cries get faster and more  
high-pitched until it dissolves into one long, loud groan.

When she slumps on the bed, limp and watery, I stop.   Devilishly I 
considered giving her another, but my good side wins  out.  Moments 
later Serenity pops up to a sitting position, her face  energetic and 
beaming her patented hypnotic smile.

&quot;OK, Rei,&quot; she grins enthusiastically, patting the bed.  &quot;Hop  up and 
I&#39;ll do you!&quot;

I hesitate, not because I don&#39;t want to, but because I don&#39;t  like 
giving in easily to her.  I at least like to put up a pretense  of a 
fight before I cave in to her, because I know I will.  You can&#39;t  look 
into those big blue eyes and not want to give her everything she  
wants.  My hesitation turns her enthusiasm into consternation.  Her  
smile dims and her eyes begin to water.  She&#39;s so unselfish - - if I  
don&#39;t let her return all the pleasure I gave her and more, she&#39;ll  
feel terrible for the rest of the day.

&quot;We can&#39;t have that,&quot; that spot between my legs tells me.  Who  am I 
to argue?  Relenting, I hop into bed next to her.  Serenity&#39;s  eyes 
light up and she&#39;s on me in a heartbeat, and soon I&#39;m soaring as  
well.

------------------------------------------------------------

Walking down the hall toward the shrine - - the shrine she  build for 
me in the palace, the shrine that has become my home and my  sanctuary 
over these many centuries, the shrine I try to thank her  for every 
moment of every day because it will never ever equal the  gratitude I 
feel - - I think back to her sleeping alone in her  chambers, love in 
her heart and a smile on her face.  Endymion is  away, meeting with 
members of the various Asian governments.  He&#39;s  been gone a week and 
he&#39;ll probably be gone another week, so she&#39;ll  probably need me 
again.

I&#39;ll be here.

Ami passes me in the hall and nods, then smiles  conspiratorially to 
herself.  She knows the secret Serenity and I  share.  She was smart 
enough to figure it out, but needed to discuss  it with Serenity and 
myself before she accepted it.  She still tends  to get protective of 
Endymion from time to time.  But even she had to  surrender to the 
necessity of the situation.

The door to the shrine slides shut behind me.  I pad over to a  
cabinet on bare feet, the hem of my priest robe brushing along the  
floor.  Taking out a stick of incense, I light it to remove the dull  
sameness of the air in the room.  A sigh escapes my lips and once  
again I experience the let down that always seems to come after.

I am Rei Hino and I am a surrogate.  When my Queen has needs  and her 
husband is not here to satisfy them, I satisfy them.  When  she&#39;s done 
with me, I return to my original position outside.  I love  her, but I 
can never have her, other than in the place of another.

Kneeling on a mat, I offer a small prayer in hopes of  dispelling this 
vague melancholy.  It began when, centuries ago?

------------------------------------------------------------

The first hundred years of life are the most varied.  The pains  seem 
the most taxing and the pleasures the most memorable.  Soon into  the 
fight to establish Crystal Tokyo amid the ruins of Tokyo, we all  
realized that we weren&#39;t aging.  Ami and Setsuna soon concluded that  
being senshi made us different, that we had a longer life-span than  
other people.  It meant many things, not all of them good, but it  
also meant that Usagi had more time to make her dream of world peace  
and harmony a reality.  When she ascended to Serenity that magical  
day, she took on new challenges and new responsibilities.  I don&#39;t  
think I was ever prouder of her than I was that day.  My little  
bubblehead was all grown up and a responsible woman.

And she had Mamoru, now ascended to Endymion.  She was his  spirit 
guide and he was her rock of strength.  They were the picture  perfect 
couple, even during the little squabbles the public didn&#39;t  see.  They 
came to symbolize love, security and hope for the future  for a race 
of people desperate for something good to hold onto after  a half 
century of strife.

I think the year was 2096.  Minako had just reminded me that it  was 
the centennial anniversary of the defeat of Sailor Galaxia - -  Minako 
keeps track of things like that.  I wandered over to  Serenity&#39;s 
chambers, partly to pass along that information and partly  to visit.  
I was sensing uneasy vibrations from her vicinity and  wanted to 
check.  As I neared her chamber, I could feel her distress.   Pushing 
politeness aside, I shoved my way in through the door.

&quot;Don&#39;t you ever knock?&quot; Serenity said crossly, glancing at me  from 
the side of her bed.  She was sitting there crying and it was  like a 
knife in my heart.

&quot;It felt like you were in distress,&quot; I replied, not backing  down.  
Serenity turned away.  &quot;I could feel you all the way out in  the hall.  
What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s nothing,&quot; she whispered, looking down.  &quot;I&#39;m just being  silly.&quot;

&quot;What else is new?&quot; I said with gentle joviality.  &quot;Tell me.&quot;

&quot;I - - no.  I&#39;m sorry I disturbed you.&quot;

&quot;You know I won&#39;t let it go like that,&quot; I warned her.

&quot;And you know how much that irritates me,&quot; she shot back, her  tears 
slowed by her annoyance.

&quot;Then talk,&quot; I persisted.  &quot;I can outlast you, Your Majesty.&quot;

&quot;Stop calling me that!&quot; she huffed.  &quot;You know I hate that  name!&quot;

&quot;Then spill!&quot; I growled.  And then a face flashed in my mind.   
&quot;You&#39;re lonely, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

Serenity&#39;s gaze sought the floor.  She was caught.

&quot;I can&#39;t help it,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I know I shouldn&#39;t.  I&#39;m one  
hundred and sixteen years old.  I should act more mature.&quot;  Her lower  
lip stuck out, one of the old Usagi characteristics I still saw in  
her.  &quot;But I&#39;ve never done well when he&#39;s away.  It&#39;s been fourteen  
days.&quot;

&quot;Doesn&#39;t he vid you?&quot; I asked.

&quot;It&#39;s not the same.  I can&#39;t touch him through a vid.  I don&#39;t  feel 
his warmth through a vid.&quot;  She sighed, a deep, condemned,  melancholy 
heave.  I put my arms around her and she clung to me,  desperate for 
the warmth and compassion of another person.  &quot;I&#39;ll get  through it.  
I&#39;ve done it before.  I&#39;ve just never been caught  before.&quot;

&quot;I could have done this sooner if I&#39;d known,&quot; I gently chided  her.

All the while, I was knotted up inside.  No one who hasn&#39;t been  in 
Serenity&#39;s presence knows what it&#39;s like.  She radiates such a  
powerful aura of - - well, love is the best way to describe it - -  
that it can be intoxicating.  I&#39;ve witnessed birds fly into her hand.   
I&#39;ve seen the most demagogue-like politician melt in her presence.   
And me - - well, I&#39;ve only harbored feelings for her that I wouldn&#39;t  
even admit to myself for the longest time.  Our embrace may have  
calmed her, but it was having the opposite effect on me.

&quot;Rei,&quot; she said gently.  &quot;Remember that Sunday we took a bath  
together?&quot;  I pulled away just enough to face her.

&quot;What made you think of that?&quot; I asked curiously.

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; she flushed, dropping her gaze.  Then she  looked up 
at me again.  &quot;I . . .&quot;

And at that moment, I could think of only one thing: to kiss  her.

And I did.

And every nerve in my body sparked.  I gathered her chin in my  hands 
as I kissed her, my lips hungry for every inch of her.  And  just as 
suddenly, I pulled back, contrite and nervous.  I have  standards that 
I expect everyone to live by, especially myself.  If  I had wronged 
her in a moment of weakness . . .

But she just looked up at me with those soulful eyes and  silently I 
realized how much she needed this and how well she  knew how much I 
needed this.  A thrill passed through my body and I&#39;m  not entirely 
sure she didn&#39;t put it there to lure me on.  But on I  continued, 
plunging back to that soft mouth.  Serenity&#39;s arms wrapped  around me 
and her chest squished up against mine.

Time became a blur.  I remember her hand loosening my robe.   Suddenly 
we were naked and I was caressing the flesh along her ribs.   One 
moment I was reclined on the bed, Serenity playfully nibbling on  the 
nipple of my right breast while my fingers dug into her hair.   The 
next, I was draped over her body, my leg pinning her down as I  licked 
between her legs and she thrashed and moaned.  I tasted nearly  every 
inch of her that afternoon and it all tasted sweet, but the  details 
blur red in my mind.

We were laying in bed, arm in arm, bodies intertwined.  Her  face was 
pressed against my chest and we were both thinking the same  thing.

&quot;I don&#39;t think we should have done this,&quot; Serenity whispered.   &quot;I 
feel like I&#39;ve betrayed Endymion.&quot;

&quot;It was a moment of weakness,&quot; I told her, for I just can&#39;t  stand to 
see her sad.  &quot;It&#39;s not like you don&#39;t love him anymore.   You had a 
need.&quot;

&quot;I should have been stronger.&quot;

&quot;You should have been a lot of things over the years,&quot; I  replied, 
blunt as ever.  &quot;We can only be who we are.&quot;  I rubbed her  arm.  &quot;Do 
you feel better?&quot;

&quot;I feel great,&quot; she grinned.  &quot;I feel guilty about feeling so  great.&quot;

&quot;You see?  You needed Endymion and he wasn&#39;t here.  You just  made 
love to him in absentia.&quot;

&quot;No I didn&#39;t, Rei,&quot; she replied firmly.  &quot;I made love to you.&quot;   She 
brushed her curls back.  &quot;If I hadn&#39;t fallen in love with  Endymion, 
I&#39;d have fallen in love with you.  You mean that much to me  and 
that&#39;s part of why I enjoyed this so much.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; I whispered, not wanting to betray the emotion in  my 
voice.

&quot;But what do we do about this?&quot;

&quot;Who says we do anything?  We kept our last encounter secret  for a 
hundred years.&quot;

&quot;He&#39;ll find out.  He&#39;s not stupid.  And I don&#39;t want to hurt  him and 
I don&#39;t want to drive him away.&quot;

&quot;Then think of it this way,&quot; I told her.  &quot;You needed help.  I  gave 
it to you.  You were lonely.  I spent time with you.  We could  have 
been talking the afternoon away reminiscing about the good old  days; 
instead we fucked like two over-sexed minks.&quot;  Serenity giggled  at 
that.  &quot;That&#39;s all it was.  It was never a slight of Endymion.  If  
you treat it like that, you won&#39;t feel guilty and he won&#39;t find out.&quot;

Serenity sighed and then buried her face in my chest again.   &quot;You 
know best,&quot; she moaned.

Me?  I was making this up as I went.  What did I know?

Our rendezvous got Serenity through the week.  Endymion  returned and 
seemed to notice nothing.  And I have to admit, he made  her far 
happier than I ever could have.  As for me, I moped around  the shrine 
with pangs of despair.  I had tasted her again after so  long.  I 
didn&#39;t want to go through another hundred years before being  with her 
again, but I knew I couldn&#39;t press for it.  That would be  selfish of 
me and detrimental to the kingdom and to her.  So I hid my  pain - - 
I&#39;m good at that.

Serenity must have noticed, though, or else she was just being  her 
usual kind self.  One evening I walked into my bedroom and found  a 
red rose on the bed.  At first I thought it was from Endymion until  I 
read the note and recognized Serenity&#39;s handwriting.  The note said  
&quot;thank you&quot;.

I still have the rose.  I keep it in a stasis jar on the top  shelf of 
my closet.

Emerging from the shrine, I walk aimlessly down the hall.  The  taste 
of her still lingers on my lips.  I must be a pretty lousy  priest if 
I can&#39;t dispel such overpowering memories with all the  prayer I just 
put myself through.  Or else, her presence is just so  overpowering 
that I never stood a chance.  A few of the palace staff  walk by and 
glance at me with confusion.  Let them stare; it&#39;s none  of their 
business anyway.

Over the centuries, Serenity and I have hooked up again.  It&#39;s never 
her idea, I assume.  My psychic nature has grown over the years to the 
point that I can always sense when she&#39;s lonely and in need.  Of 
course, Endymion being away for extended periods is a  pretty good tip 
off, too.  And I come to her, always on the sly and  always when 
Serenity&#39;s to the point where she just can&#39;t stand it any  longer.  
We&#39;re very, very discreet.  Serenity&#39;s paranoid about  hurting 
Endymion and I can&#39;t say that the thought thrills me, either.

Why does she do it if she loves Endymion so?  If you asked her,  she 
couldn&#39;t tell you.  Serenity&#39;s a creature of impulse and feeling,  not 
introspection and articulation.  She doesn&#39;t know why she feels  
certain things, only that she does.

If you ask me, though, it&#39;s only natural.  Serenity gives so  much 
love to so many people, it&#39;s only natural that she&#39;d need more  love 
than the average person, if only to replenish her supply.  Even  when 
Endymion&#39;s here, she needs Ami, Makoto, Minako and myself.   Without 
Endymion, she needs even more from us - - and I&#39;m only too  happy to 
give.

Why do I do it?  After all, it&#39;s not very requiting to make  love to a 
person once every fifty to one hundred years.

Over the course of my long life, I&#39;ve been asked more than once  why I 
never married.  I&#39;ve never answered with anything more than a  gruff 
&quot;none of your business&quot;.  Anyone who really knew me already  knew the 
answer.  I&#39;m already pledged.  I&#39;ve been pledged to her for  a 
thousand years.  Sure, so have Ami and Makoto and Minako and they  
don&#39;t sleep with her - - at least I don&#39;t think they do.  But my  
commitment to her means something a little different than it does to  
them.  When I love, I love all the way.  Oh, I&#39;ve had dalliances over  
the years with men.  I&#39;m not celibate.  And I&#39;m not homosexual - -  
not even bi-sexual.  I don&#39;t look at other women and see them as bed  
partners the way I look at men.  I don&#39;t even look at her that way.   
Our couplings are something more.

Touching her, feeling her, loving her and being loved in return  by 
her is something so beautiful it transcends mere sex.  I do it to  
make her happy.  Hell, I&#39;d cut off my right arm to make her happy.   
Because when you make her happy, it gives you the most satisfied  
feeling - - like you&#39;ve just saved the world.  And I do know what  
that feels like.

I do it for her smile.  I&#39;d do anything for that smile.  And  if that 
explanation isn&#39;t enough, well tough.

I pause at the doorway leading to the reception room.   Serenity&#39;s 
holding court, meeting with the people, shaking hands and  spreading 
the word.  She works so easily with other people.  It&#39;s a  skill I 
could never learn.  I&#39;m too afraid to let someone touch me deep down.  
She, on the other hand, revels in it.  She need it like  we need food 
and water.  She lets them touch her magical aura and  it makes her so 
happy to make them happy.  A lump forms in my throat.   It&#39;s nice to 
see her renewed.  It&#39;s a proud moment for me to know  that I had a 
hand in her renewal.

If Endymion doesn&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, it&#39;s because we&#39;re  better 
at covering this up than I imagined - - more likely it&#39;s  because he 
doesn&#39;t want to know.  He&#39;s like me that way, in that  he&#39;ll do 
anything to see her smile, to make her happy and to feel  that 
happiness radiate out like a sun and bathe in its warmth.  The  means 
are less important than the end.

Serenity glances over and spots me in the doorway.  She gives  me a 
warm smile and suddenly I don&#39;t have a care in the world.

Who wouldn&#39;t want to protect that?
