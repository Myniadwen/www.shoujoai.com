---The De-Programming of Chibi Chibi Part III in 3-D---

Hotaru was in the kitchen fixing herself and Chibi Usa tea, when she 
noticed how quiet it was in the other room.

Too quiet.

&quot;Chibi Usa-chan,&quot; Hotaru called out as she walked back into the living 
room with the two cups of tea, &quot;How&#39;s little Chibi Chibi?&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s fine.&quot; The pink-haired young girl answered, adding, &quot;I gave her 
some books I found under Usagi&#39;s bed.&quot;

&quot;Chibi Usa,&quot; Hotaru said as she snatched the books away from Chibi 
Chibi, &quot;These aren&#39;t books, they&#39;re manga.&quot;

&quot;So, what&#39;s the difference?&quot;

&quot;Chibi Chibi shouldn&#39;t be reading manga like these! Look at these 
titles; The Thing Without a Face, The Face Without a Thing, The Face 
With a Thing in its Face, and The Thing With a Face in its Thing. Those 
are awful, and they&#39;re only going to make her worse!&quot;

&quot;Well then what are we supposed to do? Try children&#39;s television again?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; Hotaru said exasperatedly as she grabbed the remote, &quot;I 
guess it&#39;s worth a shot.&quot;

&quot;Oh Barney is a carnivore who likes to eat young children...&quot;

---Click---

The two young girls sat silently together as they tried to come up with 
ideas. Finally, Chibi Usa broke the silence.

&quot;Okay,&quot; Usagi&#39;s future daughter said in defeat, &quot;We need help.&quot;

&quot;Chibi chibi biiiyyyyaaa...&quot;

Spray.

---Omake Twenty-Two: The Mina Show---

&quot;And now, ladies and gentleman, it&#39;s the Mina show!&quot; a voice announces 
as Aino Minako&#39;s name appears on screen. As an audience begins clapping 
and chanting Mina&#39;s name, the blonde host of the daytime talk show came 
out, waving to her fans as she waited for the cheering to die down.

&quot;Thank you all.&quot; she said as she bowed to the audience, &quot;Well, after 
Monday&#39;s show where we sent out of control teens to boot camp, and 
yesterday&#39;s show where a guest found out his fianc&eacute;e was really a guy, 
we have a bit of a change of pace for today&#39;s show. You see, our first 
guest is here because she has a secret admirer, but what she doesn&#39;t 
know is that it&#39;s her own best friend. Her best female friend.&quot;

As the crowd began to &quot;Ooooh!&quot;, one of the audience members turned to 
his fianc&eacute;e and her best friend, smiling ear to ear.

--

&quot;Isn&#39;t this great hon?&quot; Mamoru said, &quot;I mean, I knew you liked this 
show, and I also just happened to be old pals with one of the security 
guards.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s great!&quot; Usagi said enthusiastically, &quot;I can&#39;t wait for the chairs 
to start flying and the funny fights to break out.&quot;

&quot;I think it&#39;s horrible.&quot; her friend Rei said, &quot;Someone is about to be 
told by their best friend that they are the object of a romantic crush, 
and on this stupid trash talk show of all places.&quot;

&quot;Humph.&quot; Mamoru grunted, &quot;Usagi, remind me again why we brought her with 
us?&quot;

--

&quot;And now everyone,&quot; Minako said cheerfully, &quot;Let&#39;s give a warm welcome 
to our first guest, Kino Makoto!&quot;

Everyone in the crowd began to clap as a tall young lady came out 
carrying a cake. As she sat on one of the chairs on the stage, she 
blushed cutely from the applause the audience was giving her.

&quot;Makoto... May I call you Mako-chan?&quot; Mina asked.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Makoto answered with a nervous nod, adding &quot;I&#39;ve never seen this 
show before, but I...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s just great.&quot; Minako said, cutting her off. &quot;I see you brought a 
cake with you.&quot;

&quot;I... Well, yes.&quot; Makoto said, sweating under the studio lighting and 
feeling uncomfortable having the television camera aimed at her, &quot;I, um, 
I thought that my secret admirer might like it. I... I made it myself.&quot;

&quot;Aaaaw.&quot; The audience said collectively. Minako then turned to the 
audience with a mischievous smile on her face.

&quot;And now, let&#39;s being out your secret admirer.&quot; Minako announced. Makoto 
turned to the side of the stage, only to see her best friend Mizuno Ami 
come out on stage. As the audience began to &quot;Ooooh&quot; and snicker, Makoto 
gave her friend a funny look.

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot; Makoto said, &quot;What are you doing up here? I&#39;m going to meet 
a secret admirer, and...&quot;

&quot;M... Mako-chan.&quot; Ami stuttered out nervously, &quot;I, um... I never saw 
this show before, but a few of my fellow medical students talked about 
it, and... Um... And, sometimes, if... Um... If other people are around, 
you can, well, talk sometimes easier than if you&#39;re alone. You know? 
Like, because there are others around, and...&quot;

&quot;Ami-chan, what are you trying to... Oh, oh my...&quot; she gasped as 
realization slowly set in.

&quot;I see you go out with all those losers, and they always break your 
heart, and I... Oh god, I...&quot; her voice drifted off as she saw the look 
her friend was giving her.

&quot;I... I came all the way here,&quot; Makoto murmured, &quot;And baked a cake... 
for this?&quot;

--

Rei felt her heart begin to break for the slightly smaller young woman 
up on stage. She knew what it felt like; to love your best friend, only 
to see her with a loser.

Usagi likewise felt sorry for the girl with the crush. She had a crush 
for her best friend. Of course, she knew Rei didn&#39;t feel that way about 
her. Which meant she was stuck with Mamoru. The worst part was having to 
pretend she liked these stupid trashy talk shows he was so into.

&quot;Oh boy.&quot; Mamoru said excitedly, &quot;Here comes the part with the chairs 
flying. I can feel it!&quot;

--

&quot;Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said, &quot;Your best friend has revealed that she is in 
love with you. What&#39;s your reaction?&quot;

I... I don&#39;t know.&quot; The young woman answered as she clutched onto the 
plate her cake was resting on, &quot;Shock? I mean, I never knew she was a 
lesbian, and... I, I need to think about all this...&quot; she said as Ami 
looked sadly on.

&quot;I see.&quot; Minako said, &quot;Well, let&#39;s see if anyone in the audience has 
anything to... Yes, you.&quot; she said, making her way up to where Mamoru 
was sitting. The young man turned around to see Usagi&#39;s friend Rei with 
her hand up in the air.

&quot;Hello.&quot; Rei said as Minako passed her the microphone, &quot;I just wanted to 
say that, even if she doesn&#39;t love you back, I think you did the right 
thing.&quot; the dark-haired young woman swallowed hard and continued, 
&quot;Because I have a crush on my own best female friend, and... And for you 
to have the courage to tell her is...&quot; her voice drifted off as she 
started to cry. She handed the mike back to Minako and sat back down, 
burying her face in her hands.

As Minako went to get another audience comment, Makoto thought about 
what the stranger had just said. What Ami had said probably took every 
bit of courage her friend had. And it wasn&#39;t as if Ami was ugly or 
anything. Makoto was still shocked, but somehow, knowing that the sweet, 
caring friend she always went to with her troubles was in love with her 
was strangely comforting.

Usagi, meanwhile, stared in silent shock at her best friend. Rei really 
did feel the same for her as she did for Rei. But she was engaged to 
Mamoru. She needed a way out of the relationship. Her mind started to 
run as she began to think up a plan.

--

&quot;Good point.&quot; Minako said as she took the mike from another audience 
member, &quot;Are there any other...&quot;

&quot;You (bleep)ing jerk!&quot; someone screamed. Minako ran to the source of the 
yell as higher ratings danced before her eyes.

&quot;Ma&#39;am,&quot; Minako said to the blonde in the odangos who was shrieking at 
the dumbfounded man sitting next to her, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s (bleep)ing going on! He just called that young 
lady down there a dirty (bleep) (bleep)ing (bleep)!&quot; Usagi said as she 
pointed at Ami.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Makoto asked, unable to conceive of anyone saying something bad 
about her cute little best friend.

&quot;WHAT?&quot; Mamoru cried out, &quot;I never called her dirty! Er... that is, I 
never said...&quot;

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Rei asked, &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&quot;Oh really?&quot; Usagi shouted, &quot;You never called her dirty, but you did 
call her a (bleep) (bleep)ing (bleep)!&quot;

&quot;I never called that (bleep) a (bleep)ing (bleep)!&quot; Mamoru shouted.

Makoto could feel her anger begin to rise within her. Ami was always 
there for her, whether it be for help with a test or emotional support 
after a boyfriend dumped her. She turned to her friend, only to see Ami 
starting to weep.

That&#39;s when something inside her snapped.

&quot;You (bleep)ing a(bleep)ole!&quot; she screamed at Mamoru as she picked up 
her chair with one hand, &quot;How dare you say that about my girlfriend!&quot; 
She then turned to a shocked Ami and smiled.

&quot;Here.&quot; she said, handing the cake to her friend. As Ami took it, Makoto 
closed the distance between them and kissed her tenderly on the lips.

&quot;Forgive me.&quot; Makoto said, &quot;I&#39;ve been a fool, and as soon as I&#39;m done 
shoving this (bleep)ing chair up that (bleep)ing (bleep)&#39;s (bleep), I 
promise to make it up to you.&quot; With that, she turned away and stormed up 
into the audience after Mamoru.

The audience, sensing the upcoming carnage, began to cheer &quot;Fight! 
Fight! Fight!&quot; Mamoru&#39;s eyes widened in fear as he saw the brunet 
storming up after him with the chair.

&quot;Holy (beep)!&quot; he shouted as he began to try to get up from his seat and 
run up the aisle away from the angry young cook. Before he could get up 
the aisle, however, a foot suddenly stuck out and tripped Mamoru. The 
young man fell backwards and tumbled down the stairs, causing Minako and 
Makoto to both run back down the aisle to get out of his way. As he 
landed at the bottom of the stairs dead, a certain blonde pulled her leg 
back in the aisle and tried to whistle innocently.

&quot;Wow.&quot; Minako whispered, &quot;Someone died on my show, this will easily get 
me an extra twenty share in the ratings this week... Er...&quot; she gasped 
as she realized the camera and microphone were picking up what she was 
saying, &quot;Um... Coming up next, a violinist who&#39;s about to learn that her 
handsome formula-one racecar driving boyfriend is actually a she! Right 
after this commercial break.&quot;

As the commercial for the DVD Aino Minako: Too Hot For TV began to play, 
a stunned Rei turned to Usagi.

&quot;U... Usagi-chan,&quot; the raven-haired young woman said, &quot;You... You set 
Mamoru up. You... You killed him!&quot;

&quot;Well,&quot; Usagi began, &quot;I just found out that you loved me, Rei. And I... 
I love you too. But I was trapped in an engagement to Mamoru and...&quot;

&quot;Usagi,&quot; Rei said incredulously, &quot;You didn&#39;t have to kill him. You 
could&#39;ve just broken off the engagement, you know.&quot;

A brief moment of silence passed between the two.

&quot;Oh yeah.&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Oops.&quot;

Rei&#39;s severe look melted as she suddenly began to laugh, &quot;Usagi, you&#39;re 
so silly.&quot; She chuckled, &quot;Only you would do something that ridiculous.&quot; 
And with that she pulled Usagi into a loving kiss.

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: This chapter is dedicated to Mireiyu, who wrote a very tender 
and touching story about Makoto and Ami that somehow inspired me to 
write this piece of drivel.</pre>
