Figure in black which points at me

Turn round quick, and start to run

Find out I&#39;m the chosen one

Oh no

Black Sabbath, Black Sabbath

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

Ants.

Filthy, stinking little ants.

Making noise, making more ants, playing in the sun.

Ants.

There were once ants of every shape, size and color.

There were firefighter ants, doctor ants, store clerk ants, student 
ants, construction worker ants...

Senshi ants...

There were the four ants who tried to form a containment field around 
Mugan Academy.

There was the pink-haired ant who lost her pure heart.

There was the time ant, momentarily putting off the inevitable.

There were the two dyke ants who in the end realized all their struggle 
was for nothing.

Finally, there was the queen ant who foolishly surrendered the grail and 
inadvertently help to usher in the Age of the Great Silence.

They were all gone now; all of them. All the filthy noisy ants, crushed 
under the heel of the Messiah of Silence. And ever since the world had 
been cleansed, all had remained silent, dark, undisturbed.

But now...

Now someone was disturbing the immaculate tranquility of the beautiful 
new world, walking around, raising a ruckus, extinguishing the perfect 
darkness. This inexcusable transgression could not be allowed to go 
unpunished. The new ants had to be crushed as well, lest they further 
desecrate the holy sanctity of the new world.

It was time for the Messiah to rise once again from her tomb.

Within the dark bowels of what was left of Mugan Academy something dark 
and oily began to slither. A second soon joined it, then a third began 
to curl and wiggle. The basement floor became alive with black squirming 
tentacles resembling thousands of eels or snakes sliding against one 
another. Slowly, from the midst of the dark horrifying mass a body began 
to emerge. It was a young emaciated woman with chalk-white skin, sunken 
eyes and a black five-pointed star on her forehead. The tentacles moved 
in a frenzy all around her, lifting her up, encircling and entering her. 
As she at last came to the surface with arms outstretched, the tentacles 
receded. The herald of the Tau Nebula and Pharaoh Ninety was needed once 
again.

A pair of nostrils flared open and took in their first full breath in 
over ten years.

The woman opened her black eyes, smiling maniacally in the darkness.

---Tokyo, the Present---

&quot;Hoshi!&quot; the child&#39;s mother screamed as she ran out of the grocery 
store, &quot;Hoshi!&quot;

&quot;You monster!&quot; Mars shouted, &quot;She was just a child. How could you?&quot;

Sailor Jupiter angrily started to stride toward the scientist, &quot;You 
can&#39;t take us all on.&quot; she snarled as Venus likewise stated to approach.

&quot;Oh no?&quot; Saeko asked mockingly as she brought the orb up to point at 
Jupiter, &quot;Watch me.&quot;

Before she could use the weapon, a gigantic lightning bolt landed in 
front of her from the sky, moving from right to left in front of her and 
tearing a two foot wide trench into the concrete of the parking lot. The 
Sailor Senshi present moved back shielding their eyes from the intense 
light produced and the flying concrete debris. Looking back, they saw a 
young woman who looked a bit like Usagi but with a different hair style 
come from above and land between them and the scientist. The woman 
narrowed her eyes and clenched her fists as bolts of static electricity 
encircled her body and shot out from her, causing the glass front of the 
supermarket as well as every car windshield and parking lot light within 
a hundred feet of her to explode outward. Michiru, still within the 
store, used the diversion to run to the back and transform.

Saeko took a step back, a look of fear now evident on her face.

&quot;You?&quot; she asked, &quot;They sent you back for me?&quot;

&quot;What did you do with the Lady Minerva, Saeko?&quot; the woman in front of 
her asked as her eyes began to glow white, &quot;Tell me now or...&quot;

&quot;Wait a second,&quot; Sailor Venus asked, &quot;Just who are you supposed to be?&quot;

Saeko looked at the blond in front of her inquisitively, &quot;They don&#39;t 
know?&quot; she asked. A grin slowly appeared on her face, &quot;Of course! You 
were told not to tell them, weren&#39;t you? Mustn&#39;t cause ripples in time, 
must we?&quot; she asked sarcastically.

Sailor Neptune snuck out the back of the grocery store. The newcomer 
intentionally ignored Saeko&#39;s comments as she continued to come toward 
the scientist.

&quot;You&#39;re coming with me to answer for your crimes,&quot; she said, &quot;But not 
before you tell me where Lady Minerva is.&quot;

The scientist began to slide her hand into her pocket. She had four 
flash grenades smuggled into her prison cell, and had used two already, 
&quot;She&#39;s free!&quot; she exclaimed, &quot;Don&#39;t any of you understand; I freed her!&quot;

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot; Sailor Neptune yelled from behind, aiming the attack at 
the scientist. Saeko quickly aimed the sphere at the attack coming 
towards her and in a flash of blue light it disappeared.

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

&quot;And then what happened?&quot; Hoshi asked as she held her hands up to the 
fire to warm herself. Sailor Minerva had the tattered blanket she&#39;d 
found earlier wrapped around them both and was telling her a childhood 
story.

&quot;Well, then Urashima reached home and learned that three hundred years 
had passed and everyone he knew was dead. Feeling sad, he remembered the 
jewel encrusted box that the queen of the Dragon Palace had given him 
and opened it. But the box contained his true age, and...&quot; Minerva 
stopped as she heard something like the distant sound of thunder. She 
saw in the distance a blue light flash once again, and began to prepare 
herself for another new neighbor in this hell she found herself in.

What she got instead was a very nasty surprise in the form of Sailor 
Neptune&#39;s water attack shooting out of the beam at high speed towards 
her and her companion. The child started to scream in fear. Minerva had 
no time to question why her friend&#39;s attack was appearing out of 
nowhere; she had to act and act fast.

&quot;Great Shield!&quot; she shouted, surrounding herself and Hoshi with the 
force barrier just in time. The attack ricochet off her shield and was 
sent careening into the giant statue made up of skulls near its base. As 
the thing exploded near the support structure, the entire figure shook.

&quot;Oh shit.&quot; Minerva whispered as the statue of skulls started to noisily 
collapse. It sunk violently downwards up to its knees, a cloud of dust 
and debris rising up to its abdomen before it began to tumble the rest 
of the way sideways. Hoshi buried her face in Minerva&#39;s shoulder and 
covered her ears, scared of the noise. Minerva looked on as a rain of 
skulls and dust began to deflect off the force field.

Unseen by the Senshi, a dark figure was exiting the remains of a 
building at that very moment not far away.

---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

Lady Pluto looked on as the deterioration in her beloved&#39;s condition 
continued. Her wife was no longer fading in and out of solidness, but 
rather back and forth between mere transparency and near invisibility. 
She could feel the ripples within the time stream, multiplying with 
every second as not just her Minerva but countless other lives were 
slowly dissolving. Soon, history itself would begin to realign itself to 
exclude them all, the over five hundred in the present, their ancestors 
going back over a thousand years, and the woman she held in her arms.

The most infuriating thing for Pluto was she couldn&#39;t remember what had 
happened. How could there be a gap in history for the Princess of Time?

There were two possibilities to account for this, neither one being very 
pleasant. The first being that time had already begun to realign itself 
to accommodate for there being no Minerva. As such, memories of their 
time together were already starting to fade. The second was that somehow 
a mental block had been placed on her around or shortly after the time 
of the events, preventing her from knowing what had happened. She wanted 
with all her might to go back herself after the scientist, to hurt her, 
to make her suffer just as she and her beloved were now suffering. But 
she couldn&#39;t leave Minerva. Not now. Not when any moment may be their 
last together.

Her love opened her eyes a crack and smiled weakly, &quot;Don&#39;t cry.&quot; she 
whispered, &quot;Lady... Lady Jupiter will... save me...&quot;

Pluto held her close, noting how cold she had become. &quot;How?&quot; she asked, 
&quot;How can you be so sure?&quot;

Lady Minerva&#39;s smile widened ever so slightly; her memory was a bit 
better than her wife&#39;s.

---Tokyo, the Present---

Sailor Neptune stood there stunned as what had just taken place, 
&quot;That... That&#39;s impossible.&quot; Saeko pulled her hand out of her pocket and 
detonated the third flash bomb just as Sailor&#39;s Uranus, Moon and Mercury 
arrived. Emi managed to get her right forearm up just in time to shield 
her eyes. The others were not so lucky.

&quot;Damn it.&quot; Emi muttered as she reached down quickly with her left hand 
and touched the pavement to ground herself, releasing the stored up 
charge of electricity safely into the earth, &quot;How many of those things 
does she have on her?&quot; , Promptly rising again, she saw that the woman 
was running for the streets.

&quot;Emi!&quot; Sailor Moon called over, &quot;What...&quot;

&quot;The street to the left of the store.&quot; she said, &quot;Usagi-chan, where does 
it lead to?&quot;

Every Sailor Senshi present with the exception of Sailors Moon and 
Uranus were stunned; she knew who Sailor Moon was. Uranus answered 
first.

&quot;The subway.&quot; the sandy blond answered as spots continued to dance 
before her eyes, &quot;She heading back to the subway.&quot;

Emi quickly took off in pursuit. She was almost to the curb when an 
extremely angry looking Sailor Pluto landed in front of her.

&quot;Where is she?&quot; she demanded. Looking at the blond rapidly running her 
way, she aimed her staff at her as Sailor Saturn arrived. &quot;You!&quot; she 
ordered, &quot;Who are you, where is...&quot;

&quot;Damn it, not now!&quot; the blond yelled as she started to run past her. Out 
of the corner of her eye she saw Saturn start to block her path. Emi 
frowned; there was no time to stand still and explain what was going on. 
Saeko had to be stopped now.

&quot;Jupiter low shock.&quot; she muttered. The two bolts that escaped her body 
struck both her friends, knocking them to the ground as she continued 
after her quarry.

For Sailor Mercury, who now had her vision back, the sight of both 
Saturn and Pluto twitching on the sidewalk was enough to answer every 
question she had about whether or not Usagi&#39;s &quot;sister&quot; could be trusted. 
She took off after her. Sailor Venus, seeing Mercury run off after 
someone in pursuit, followed.

As Emi ran after Saeko, and Mercury and Venus ran after Emi, Sailor 
Pluto clutched her staff as she slowly got to her feet, a look of 
unbridled rage present in her eyes.

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

As the dust cloud continued to hang in the air, Minerva looked down at 
her young companion, forcing a smile. &quot;Hoshi, it&#39;s over.&quot; she said 
reassuringly. The child looked up into her grey eyes and frowned.

&quot;Sailor Minerva-sama, where are your friends?&quot; she asked, &quot;Where are the 
other Senshi? Where&#39;s Sailor Moon?&quot;

Minerva stared silently into the girl&#39;s trusting face, trying to think 
of what to say. Before she could form a response however, her attention 
was taken by a rattling sound. Looking away from Hoshi she saw that all 
the skulls and debris from the statue were being pulled back by an 
invisible force, almost like the backdraft from an atomic blast. The 
cloud of dust likewise was pulled back, and as the Senshi watched the 
statue of the angel of death slowly began to rise again. She also began 
to realize that the rattling sound was from the thousands of skulls 
knocking into each other.

In under a minute the figure was whole again, once again holding her 
arms up in offering to an invisible force. Minerva held Hoshi as she 
lowered her shield to get a better look.

&quot;A crude likeness, I&#39;ll grant you.&quot; a woman&#39;s voice said, &quot;But don&#39;t you 
think trying to destroy it is being a bit too critical?&quot;

Minerva turned to her left to see a figure standing some thirty feet 
away, clothed in black with dark hair that reached the ground and 
followed her like a wedding train. On her paste-white forehead she saw a 
black five-pointed star. Her features looked vaguely familiar, but 
twisted to look dark and sinister. Her lips were black, and her eyes... 
Her eyes looked soulless, lifeless.

With a start, Minerva recognized the figure before her.

&quot;H... Hotaru, is that you?&quot; she asked. The woman in front of her tilted 
her head and raised an eyebrow.

&quot;Hotaru?&quot; she asked, the name initially having no meaning. Then, a cruel 
smirk appeared, &quot;Oh yes. Hotaru. Another ant. A coward who in the end 
lacked the courage to do what would&#39;ve been necessary to stop me or the 
one I serve.&quot;

Minerva nervously began to take a step or two back, &quot;If you&#39;re not 
Hotaru, then who are you?&quot;

&quot;I am the holy herald of the Tau Nebula, the servant who serves under 
the divine auspices of Pharaoh Ninety. I am Mistress Nine, the Messiah 
of Silence; the divine, immaculate silence which you and your child have 
sacrilegiously seen fit to desecrate. Prepare yourselves for your 
penance.&quot;</pre>
