&quot;I&#146;d probably surmise that you were almost dead.&quot;

&quot;You?&quot;  Rei tried to get up, but she couldn&#146;t find the strength to.  
Instead, she collapsed on the hospital bed with a slight fwump, 
breathing heavily.  What had that bastard done to her?

&quot;I found you in the ruins of that place,&quot; Ami said, brushing her hair 
out of her face.  She looked exhausted.  &quot;I knew I couldn&#146;t pick you up 
myself, so I called the police.  Some recognized you. A Mamoru Chiba 
told me to give you a message when you woke up.&quot;

&quot;Ugh...the Chief? What did he say? And ruins? What?&quot;  Rei opened her 
eyes and looked around the room.  It was covered in flowers and 
balloons.  Next to her bed was a single red rose and a note.  She moved 
to grab it, but Ami handed it to her.  Written in neat scrawl was this 
message:
 
Hey,
 
Glad you didn&#146;t die, but consider yourself on paid vacation.  The 
doc(she&#146;s cute, tried to get her number) said you were completely fucked 
up when she got there, babbling about vampires and some chick named 
Serenity.  Take a break.  Don&#146;t go looking for trouble.  I mean it Hino.
 
Love you(I guess),

Mamoru
 
Rei fell back on the bed.  

&quot;Dammit.&quot;  Ami shook her head and looked Rei over.

&quot;What happened to you?&quot;

&quot;Serenity happened to me.  I got there, to her um, &#145;chamber,&#146;&quot; she saw 
Ami repress a shudder, &quot;and she started talking about how we were &#145;meant 
to be.&#146;  Then she bit me.&quot;  Ami looked horrified.

&quot;Bit you?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.  I got mad; she completely broke down.  It was...weird.  
Then...something else happened, but I can&#146;t remember...what are you 
doing?&quot;  Ami had moved to her side, and was now checking her neck.  Sure 
enough, there were two puncture wounds.

&quot;This is bad...&quot;  Ami said, paling immediately.  She remembered how 
those vampires had been.

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Well...you are...you do have bite marks.  You&#146;re probably going 
to...change. Say &#145;ahh.&#146;&quot;

Rei blinked.

&quot;Why?&quot;

&quot;So I can see if you have fangs.&quot;

&quot;I do not have fangs!&quot;

&quot;How do you know?&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes and opened her mouth, letting Ami check.  

&quot;Nothing there.  Odd.  You can close your mouth now.&quot;  Rei did so and 
closed her eyes before addressing the young doctor.

&quot;We need to go somewhere.&quot;

&quot;You&#146;re not going anywhere.  You can barely stand.&quot;

&quot;Well then you&#146;re going to go.  You get to play amateur detective 
today.&quot;

&quot;I have work,&quot; Ami said, shaking her head, &quot;and your boss specifically 
told me not to let you leave.&quot;

&quot;I don&#146;t care!  ...Listen, this is important.  Vampires exist, and we&#146;re 
going to find them.&quot;

&quot;I&#146;m well aware of that, but they are gone now.  We shouldn&#146;t worry 
about it.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, &#145;we shouldn&#146;t worry&#146;?!&quot;  Those freaks are probably 
out...bathing in the blood of virgins or something!&quot;

&quot;They all seemed rather refined, if a bit...oversexed.  I doubt they 
would be doing something like that.&quot;

&quot;No...you don&#146;t get it...&quot;
 
You thought you could run away?

No, don&#146;t hurt her! Please...
 
&quot;They&#146;re with someone else!&quot;

&quot;Someone else?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot;

Ami looked skeptical.

&quot;Who?&quot;

&quot;His name is...Demando.  He&#146;s not like them, not at all.  Dangerous...&quot; 
she winced.  Something had happened, but she couldn&#146;t remember.  It 
seemed as if her mind was covered in a thick haze.

&quot;And they aren&#146;t?&quot; 

Rei yawned.

&quot;Not like him.&quot;

Ami shook her head and yawned herself.

&quot;Did you hit your head?  This all sounds a little hard to believe.  What 
did this Demando do, whisk them all away?&quot;

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

Ami was silent for a moment, as she remembered the message Minako had 
given her.

&quot;Hmm...one of them did tell me that they didn&#146;t have much time 
left...but where would he have taken them?&quot;

&quot;Hopefully somewhere close,&quot;  Rei responded.  &quot;I don&#146;t feel like being a 
globetrotting vampire hunter.  Doesn&#146;t sound like much fun.&quot;

&quot;I agree,&quot;  Ami said.  &quot;And besides, I have a job.  This is...the last 
thing I needed to know.&quot;

&quot;You and me both,&quot;  Rei muttered dryly.

Mitsuki was bored.  She had been waiting for the past two hours for this 
detective, and there was no one in sight.  Usually, a few curious kids, 
or a weapon collector would make their way in here, but it was oddly 
quiet.  Her employer had been behaving oddly for the past three weeks 
before her odd request the night before.  And then there was Minako.  
Mitsuki had no idea where she was either, and she was worried.  The 
woman was odd, but she seemed kind enough.  And she had rescued her; it 
didn&#146;t seem right that she would leave without some sort of reward.
 
She yawned and blew dust off of the counter, looking toward the back 
room.  Would it hurt to check before the detective arrived?  

What Kazuki doesn&#146;t know won&#146;t hurt her, Mitsuki thought, making her way 
toward the room.  Kazuki always said she needed to study things that 
were not always obvious at first glance; this was the perfect 
opportunity to do so.  

She knocked on the wall near the door three times as instructed, and she 
heard a noise from behind it.  She turned the knob of the door and 
slipped into the dusty, dark room, fumbling around for a light.

&quot;She should have added, &quot;And do bring a flashlight, dear,&quot; because it is 
seriously dark in here,&quot;  Mitsuki grumbled, moving to pull a cobweb off 
of her shoulder.  She finally found a light switch and flicked it on.  
As Kazuki had stated, there was a book with a key in the center of the 
room, on an old wood table.

Mitsuki lifted the book and blew dust off of the cover.  She grabbed the 
key and put it into a barely noticeable latch on the book, taking great 
care not to destroy the pages.  She recognized Kazuki&#146;s handwriting 
immediately.

December 2, 1890

Today, Father allowed me to play in the square, and I saw a rather odd 
young woman.  She was dressed as if she came from a wealthy family, and 
I wondered why she would ever waste her time in a place like this.  This 
is a small town, and a rich woman would not waste her time watching 
someone such as myself play.  She had a very interesting skin tone, 
perhaps she was somewhere from the islands far off?  Whatever the case, 
she seemed oddly interested in me.  I could not see her very well from 
were I had been sitting, but I could...feel her eyes on me, it was all 
rather strange.  The woman walked over to me and asked me what my name 
was.  I told her, and she said that her name was Setsuna Meiou.  I was 
almost sure she was from somewhere far off now, as her name was foreign.  
She said she had traveled a &#145;long way&#146; to meet someone like me, I wonder 
what she meant?  She was quite strange, but she said she could help me 
with my piano.  I want to be great, world-famous.  It is quite rare to 
have women achieve things in this day and age; I&#146;d like to trust this 
woman, but I am still confused.  Why would she choose me, and why had 
she been traveling all this time to meet me?

&quot;18...90?&quot;  Mitsuki whispered, staring at the weathered pages.

&quot;How...how old are you anyway, Kazuki?&quot;
