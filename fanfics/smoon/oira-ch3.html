<h1>Oira Imei Satsu Made Shikyo (We Shall Stay Together Until Death) (part 3 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/oira-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>    Two dark figures looked down at the unconcious form of Seiya. She 
was lying on a bed, her raven hair undone from it&#39;s ponytail, spread 
out underneath her like an ocean of black curls, her eyes closed. One 
figure was Cordella, the other was hidden in the shadows, but it spoke 
with a deep male voice.

     &quot;This is the one?&quot;

     &quot;Hai Lord Morphium. This is the sailor senshi known as Sailor 
Star Fighter, I saw her henshin with my own eyes in adition to the 
information we found.&quot;

     Morphium looked down at Seiya. The bite mark on her neck was 
bleeding badly. &quot;Take care of the wound on her neck, you have to stop 
being so sloppy.&quot;

     Cordella bowed. &quot;Gomen nasai my lord.&quot;

     Morphium turned and started to walk away. &quot;We will have to take 
this slow. She is a sailor senshi, her sailor crystal, her starseed, 
her core of power, and her pure heart. They will resist our efforts to 
turn her.&quot; as he dissapeared he spoke one instruction. &quot;Erase her 
memory then give her a jolt of your power, then your bite will take 
affect.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     When Seiya awoke she was lying in a bed, she was wearing a long 
black tunic like shirt and black leggings. &quot;W-where.....am I.....? 
......Who....am....I......?&quot;

     Cordella stepped out of the shadows, walked up to her, and smiled 
peculiarly sweetly.

     &quot;W-who are you?&quot;

     &quot;My name is Cordella.&quot;

     &quot;Do you....know...who I am...?&quot;

     &quot;Of course, your name is Seiya Kou.&quot;

     &quot;Where is Odango?&quot;

     Cordella&#39;s eyes widened. The girl wasn&#39;t supposed to remember 
anyone, but her heart still held the memory of a girl she called 
Odango. She narrowed her eyes as a thought came to her. &quot;What does 
your &#39;Odango&#39; look like?&quot;

     Seiya closed her eyes and concentrated hard. &quot;I....I can see her 
face...she had blond hair and blue eyes, her hair is up in this 
strange style, the buns on her head look like dumplings, thus the name 
I call her....&quot;

     &quot;Oh....dear...&quot;

     &quot;.....Where is she.....?&quot;

     Cordella smiled inwardly. This would work out just fine. On the 
outside she changed her face to that of a sad one. &quot;There was a girl 
of that description...she was killed...by the Sailor Senshi.&quot;

     Seiya&#39;s eyes widened and filled with tears. &quot;O-odango....? 
....no....&quot;

     Cordella nodded solemnly. &quot;And the one named Sailor Moon took 
your love&#39;s appearence. The Sailor Senshi are evil and only care about 
their planet because it is the only place where they aren&#39;t known for 
their true selves.&quot;

     Seiya&#39;s hands clentched. &quot;Odango......&quot;

     &quot;You both were under attack by the Sailor Senshi. We just barely 
rescued you from the senshi&#39;s grip. We were unfortuantly too late for 
your Odango. I am sorry Seiya.&quot;

     Seiya&#39;s eyes narrowed. &quot;Sailor senshi.......&quot;

     &quot;I can help you take revenge for your odango.&quot;

     Seiya looked at her sharply. &quot;Honto?!&quot;

     Cordella nodded. &quot;I can give you the power you need to destroy 
them all.&quot;

     Seiya nodded. &quot;How?!&quot;

     Cordella extended her hand. &quot;First, you must trust me. Take my 
hand.&quot;

     Seiya hesitated. Something in the back of her mind screamed it 
was a trick, that this wasn&#39;t what it seemed. Seiya shoved that part 
of her mind away and extended her hand and took Cordella&#39;s. Cordella&#39;s 
eyes widened slightly as she looked at the gold star bracelet on the 
girl&#39;s wrist. It would work out nicely indeed... As soon as Seiya&#39;s 
hand enclosed Crodella&#39;s a jolt of red energy shot through the vampire 
into Seiya, through her bracelet which acted like a battery pack. for 
the evil power. Seiya&#39;s eyes widened, her hair whipped around, blown 
by an unseen wind, the irises of her blue eyes became slits like a 
cat&#39;s eyes and they began to flicker red, her teeth grew pointed, two 
of them growing unusually long into fangs. Cordella&#39;s eyes glowed 
bright red. The bite mark on Seiya&#39;s neck healed with a bright red 
flash and Seiya&#39;s head shot up.

     &quot;I can help you destroy the sailor senshi......&quot;

     &quot;I will destroy the sailor senshi.....&quot; and Seiya&#39;s face twisted 
into an evil smirk, her eyes glowing bright red like Cordella&#39;s. Her 
fangs glinting in the light of the flickering candles that decorated 
the room. Her star braclet, continuing to feed her the negative 
energy.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     One year passed. The seasons changed from Summer, to Fall, to 
Winter, to Spring, and once again to Summer. Usagi half heartedly went 
to school, she didn&#39;t hang out with her friends, she spent all her 
time buried in books and school work. She didn&#39;t have any fun. She got 
straight A&#39;s, but at the cost of her social life. There wasn&#39;t an 
attack, Sailor Moon wasn&#39;t needed. 

     Then, it was that day. The one year aniversary of Seiya&#39;s 
kidnapping. Usagi had woken up and ran to the park where Seiya had 
been taken, but she wasn&#39;t there. Usagi sat there all morning, skipped 
school, and stayed there all afternoon. But still no Seiya. Soon, the 
stars came out but still no Seiya. Hours later, her watch beeped, 
1:00am. 30 minutes later, Usagi finally fell asleep on the bench. 
&quot;Seiya......&quot; she whispered.

     The other Senshi had come looking for her, they knew where she 
would come. They knew that she had proabably forgotten that Seiya had 
been taken the next day, at 1:36am. Haruka looked at her watch. 
1:34am........
     
     Chibiusa rested her head on her mother&#39;s comfortingly. &quot;Don&#39;t 
worry Mama.....Seiya will be back soon...&quot; She closed her eyes 
thinking, She has to...or mama will be so depressed.....

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     &quot;Are you ready?&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;You&#39;re mission is to destroy the sailor senshi.&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;The one called Sailor Moon, Tsukino Usagi, she will tell you 
things, all of them will tell you things, do not believe them.&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;You have the senshi&#39;s identities memorised?&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;Then I will drop you off, introducing you...ke ke ke......&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;Would you stop saying that?!&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;SHUT UP!!&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     &quot;ARGH!!!!!!!!!&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

     Yaten looked at her watch. The second hand went all the way 
around the face of the watch, hitting the 12 again..... 
...............1:36am..............

     &quot;I told you that I would return Sailor Senshi!!!!!!!!!&quot;

     That woke Usagi up and all the other senshi, they turned and 
looked up sharply. Cordella floated in the air, her eyes as red as 
ever. The vampire assumed an evil smirk. &quot;And as I promised.......&quot; 
she swirled her cape and spun out of the way.

     There was a girl there, about 18, the same age as the inner 
senshi and the starlights. She had long black hair tied in a ponytail 
at the nape of her neck, she wore a long black tunic-like shirt and 
black leggings. Her skin was a ghastly shade of white, her eyes were 
closed. A gold star braclet hung on her wrist. Usagi knew that raven 
hair, that braclet was familiar too, but last time Usagi saw it, it 
didn&#39;t glow red, like it was now.

     Usagi stepped forward hesitantly. &quot;I-is....that.....you...&quot; she 
steped on a twig, snapping it.

     The girl&#39;s eyes snapped open at the sound. Her irises of her eyes 
were like slits, like a cat&#39;s. Her eyes were blue but they were 
flickering red. The flickering was constant, her face twisted into an 
inhuman sneer, long, pointed fangs showing in the twisted smirk.

     Usagi slowly shook her head. &quot;N-no........this....can&#39;t 
be....no......Seiya....no....you....can&#39;t....no....! WHAT HAVE YOU 
DONE TO HER?!!!!!?!?!?!??!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

     Cordella smirked. &quot;I said I&#39;d bring her back. I didn&#39;t say she 
would have any memory of you all.&quot; she turned to Seiya. &quot;Now, 
Seiya-chan, destroy those Sailor Senshi.&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     Cordella fell over. &quot;STOP SAYING THAT!!!!!!!&quot;

     &quot;Hai mistress.&quot;

     Cordella fell on her knees and started to cry.  &quot;T.T why 
me.......?!&quot;

     The senshi sweatdroped but became alert when Seiya started to 
walk towards them, her eyes flickering dangerously, her face still 
that twisted grin, her fangs glinting in the moonlight. They all 
henshined except Usagi.

     Usagi started towards her. &quot;Seiya...Seiya please! Its me! Usagi! 
Your Odango!&quot;

     Seiya&#39;s eyes flashed bright red. &quot;LIAR!!!!!!! YOU AREN&#39;T 
ODANGO!!! THE SAILOR SENSHI ARE THE ENEMY!!!!! THEY KILLED ODANGO!!!! 
AND YOU TOOK HER FACE!!!!! NOW YOU WILL PAY!!!!!!!!&quot;

     Usagi stepped back, horrified by the girl&#39;s anger. 
&quot;Seiya.......what have they.....done...to you........?&quot;

     Uranus and Venus leapt infront of Usagi, Uranus brandishing her 
space sword. &quot;If you want our princess, you&#39;ll have to get through us 
first!&quot; she stated.

     Usagi gasped, &quot;Haruka-san NO! You can&#39;t fight Seiya!! Shes not 
even henshined for Kami&#39;s sake! She wouldn&#39;t stand a chance the way 
she is now!&quot;

     Uranus looked at her over her shoulder. &quot;Koneko, listen to me. 
That isn&#39;t the Seiya you love. The Seiya you love is gone. That is 
just a shell of her. She doesn&#39;t know you anymore. She doesn&#39;t know 
who you are or who she really is. She doesn&#39;t know shes a Sailor 
Senshi. her body is being controlled Koneko.&quot;

     Healer took a step towards her friend, her ally. &quot;Seiya! Come on! 
Don&#39;t you remember us?! Its me! Yaten! Remember how we always fought 
each other constantly?! How Taiki always broke up our arguments?!&quot;

     Seiya slowly turned her head to Healer. &quot;....Yaten...?&quot;

     Healer smiled broadly. Had she gotten through to her? The smile 
on her face shattered when Seiya raised her hand, energy flickering 
dangerously around it. Her eyes flashed. &quot;I don&#39;t know what you though 
I was going to do senshi. But, I&#39;m sure this wasn&#39;t it.&quot; a beam of 
black light shot from the palm of her hand, hitting Healer dead on, 
sending her flying through a few trees which fell after the senshi was 
sent crashing through them, cutting them in two.

     &quot;YATEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

     Jupiter ran into the woods after her, worried a tree might have 
fallen on her.

     Seiya turned her back on the fallen tree area where Healer lay 
somewhere and faced Usagi and Haruka again. This time Maker tried.

     &quot;Seiya! Please! Remember us! Its me! Taiki! Remember our friends! 
Mizuno-san! Hino-san! Kino-san! Aino-san! Remember our Princess! 
Kakyuu-hime!!!!!!&quot; She was almost pleading with her friend, her ally. 
They, as starlights, were a team, and as close as sisters.

     Seiya&#39;s eyes glowed red. Maker let out a startled exclamation as 
she rose off the ground, following the motion of Seiya&#39;s glowing hand. 
Seiya narrowed her glowing eyes. &quot;You are annoyances! Go AWAY!!!!!&quot;

     It was Maker&#39;s turn to fly as Seiya threw her harder than she had 
Healer. Maker was sent flying through the air, through an telephone 
pole and falling into the lake. Seiya didn&#39;t even seem to care as the 
wires of the pole fell and sparked. The sparks caught the leaves and 
brush and grass on fire and everything was so dry.....

     &quot;TAIKI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;

     Neptune and Mercury nodded and Neptune ran, diving into the lake 
after Maker while Mercury tryed to put out the fire with her ice/water 
attacks, with Mars trying to help by using her power ofver fire to try 
and slow the burning.

     Seiya swung her hand in an arc and Venus was thrown off in the 
same direction she had thrown Healer, a startled yelp gave the 
impression that Venus had been thrown into Jupiter. She extended her 
other arm and sent Uranus flying into the lake. Neptune had just 
pulled Maker&#39;s unconcious form onto the bank. She gasped, took a deep 
breath and dove in after her lover. Seiya then continued walking 
towards Usagi. Pluto and Saturn took Uranus and Venus&#39; place, standing 
defensivly infront of the horrified Usagi who Chibi Moon was now 
standing beside. Seiya just sneered, holding her hands high in the 
air, both Pluto and Saturn were thrown into the woods as well.

     Cordella smirked. Another cry from Jupiter...Seiya had good aim, 
that was clear. Everyone she sent flying in that direction colided 
with Jupiter - -;;;;;

     Usagi put Chibi Moon behind her, looking into Seiya&#39;s face with 
wide, horrified, frightened eyes. &quot;S--seiya.... 
please.....d-don&#39;t...do this!&quot;

     Seiya raised a hand. &quot;You are an evil sailor senshi who killed my 
Odango and stole her beauty. I cannot let that go. Her hand glowed 
brightly. &quot;Go to Hell, Tsukino Usagi.&quot;
