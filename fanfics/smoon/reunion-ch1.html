<h1>Reunion</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chichiri.html">Chichiri no Miko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Haruka stepped into her darkened apartment and tossed her keys in the
direction of the hall table. She quietly stood for a moment in the
foyer, as if listening for some sound, some sign of life. But only
silence greeted her. She sighed and walked into the living room. She
dropped her helmet on a nearby chair and eased herself down on the sofa.
For the last few weeks she had been pushing herself physically, riding
around Tokyo until the early hours in an attempt to exhaust herself. It
didn&#39;t always work, and now she had to rely on sedatives as a backup.
She gingerly turned on her side, and watched the embers die in the
fireplace. A glint of gold on the table in front of her caught her eye.
She smiled faintly as she picked up the little gold frame and gazed at
the picture it held. &#39;Why Michiru?&#39;, she thought. The memories of their
parting were still fresh.

Michiru had gotten a chance to tour with the Tokyo Symphony. Haruka was
happy for her lover, but at the same time she was dreading it. Michiru
would be gone for 6 months, and Haruka wasn&#39;t looking forward to being
away from her for that long. Things between the two went well until
Michiru&#39;s last week in Tokyo. The two fought bitterly nearly every day.
Haruka couldn&#39;t even remember what they had fought about, but she had
been mentally replaying every hateful word they had said on that last
day ever since then. Their parting was so cold that even after Haruka
had forgotten her anger, she was reluctant to call Michiru for fear of
rejection. So she spent the months since she left, alone. She didn&#39;t
lack for admirers, but no one could take Michiru&#39;s place in her heart.
She pressed her face against the pillow under her head. Not too long
ago, it held faint traces of perfume. But now the scent had faded
completely. Haruka closed her eyes and began to dream about that perfume
and the person who always wore it.

She was almost asleep when the phone rang. Groaning, she reached over
and picked up the receiver. &quot;Hello?&quot;, she mumbled.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice sang in her ear.

Haruka opened her eyes. &quot;Michiru...&quot;she whispered softly. &quot;How are you?&quot;
They fell into small talk, and then the conversation lapsed.

Suddenly Michiru blurted out, &quot;I&#39;m in Japan now. On Friday, the symphony
is doing one last concert in Tokyo. I want you to come.&quot;

Her voice dropped lower. &quot;I...I want to see you, Haruka.&quot;

Haruka was speechless. She was getting what she had longed for. &quot;Yes.
I&#39;ll meet you. Where and when?&quot; Michiru happily told her the details and
rang off. Haruka replaced the receiver in its cradle and then lay back
against the pillow, staring into the darkness.

------------------------------------------------------------

It was Friday at last. Haruka had arrived at the Symphony Hall. She was
wearing slim black trousers and a black jacket over a white open necked
shirt. The fine gold chain that Michiru had given her last year
glittered at the base of her throat. Her nervousness had caused her to
be late, so she had missed some of the performance. Michiru had put her
on the guest list, so she was able to stand backstage and watch from the
wings. She looked out over the rows of musicians. It didn&#39;t take her
long to find the one whom she was looking for. Michiru sat in the second
row. From where she stood, Haruka could see her profile clearly. Her
green hair was swept up, exposing her long, graceful neck. Haruka didn&#39;t
take her eyes off her.

When the concert was over, Haruka lingered in the wings watching the
performers file past her. She glanced through the crowd looking for
Michiru. Then, like magic she appeared, surrounded by a small cluster of
her fellow musicians. She wore a long, black gown. Her shoulders were
bare, and her skin shone like moonlight against the colour of her dress.
Seeing her after such a long absence made Haruka feel like a schoolgirl
with a crush and a faint blush crept over her cheeks. She kept her eyes
on Michiru as she approached, not wanting to speak, just wanting to take
in her image. Then Michiru saw her, and Haruka felt her heart lurch when
their eyes met. Michiru smiled and walked up to her. &quot;Thank you for
coming, Haruka.&quot; She leaned up and kissed her lightly on the cheek.
&quot;It&#39;s so good to see you.&quot; Haruka stared deeply into her dark blue eyes
and flashed her a smile. The blush on her cheeks grew a bit darker.
&quot;I&#39;m glad to see you too.&quot; She cleared her throat. &quot;I have a car waiting
when you are ready.&quot; Michiru tossed her a grin over her shoulder as she
went back to the dressing room.

A few minutes later, she was back and the two made their way to the car.
As it pulled out into the heavy Tokyo traffic,

Haruka turned to her. &quot;I didn&#39;t know if you feel like eating, but I made
reservations at that little sushi bar you like.&quot;

Michiru sighed and laid her head back against the seat. &quot;I don&#39;t really
feel like eating. I...would rather go somewhere and talk.&quot;

Her eyes locked with Haruka&#39;s. Haruka nodded and looked away, breaking
the spell. &quot;That&#39;s fine.&quot; she whispered, her heart pounding in her
chest. Quietly she asked, &quot;the apartment?&quot; Michiru grinned in the
darkness and laid her hand on her arm. &quot;That would be fine.&quot;

Soon they were back at the apartment that Haruka and Michiru once
shared. Michiru sat on the sofa and admired the view from the balcony
window as Haruka made them some drinks. The twinkling lights of Tokyo
lay below them. Michiru sighed dreamily. &quot;I had almost forgotten...&quot; she
said quietly. She glanced around the room, taking note of the fact that
the room was almost the same as the way she left it. Her eyes glinted
with mischief as she looked over at Haruka. &quot;You didn&#39;t change
anything.&quot; Haruka glanced at her and blushed slightly. &quot;You have
exquisite taste Michiru. Why would I have?&quot; &#39;Besides,&#39; she thought,
&#39;these things reminded me of you&#39;.

Haruka settled back against the couch cushions and handed on of the
drinks to Michiru. They sat there in silence watching the lights
outside. In her nervousness, Haruka quickly finished her drink. She
turned to her companion.&quot;There&#39;s so much I want to tell you, but I can&#39;t
seem to put my feelings into words. All I can say is that...I&#39;m ..&quot;.She
froze, unable to say anymore. &#39;Damn! It&#39;s so hard for me to tell you
that I&#39;m sorry.&#39;

She looked at Michiru, almost pleadingly, and then looked down at the
floor. Michiru leaned forward and cupped Haruka&#39;s chin in her hand.
&quot;Look at me, Haruka&quot;. When the blonde turned back toward her, Michiru
surprised her with a light kiss on the lips. She moved back and looked
at Haruka, her eyes glistening with unshed tears. &quot;I&#39;m sorry too
Haruka.&quot;

Michiru laid a hand against Haruka&#39;s cheek and gazed adoringly at her
lovely face. &quot;I have missed you&quot; she whispered. Haruka took her hand
away and kissed it, then looked back into her eyes. She leaned over and
kissed Michiru, sliding her warm tongue into her inviting mouth. The
green haired woman responded and wrapped her arms around Haruka&#39;s neck,
pulling her closer. All the longing of the last few months welled up
inside Haruka. She slid her hands over Michiru&#39;s body, caressing her
through the silk fabric of her dress. Michiru&#39;s breath was warm against
her cheek. &quot;Haruka?&quot;, she whispered breathlessly.

Haruka pulled back a little. Michiru was staring at her, a faint smile
playing on her lips. Her cheeks began to pink and she reluctantly
released her. Her mind began to reel as she tried to think of something
to say. Michiru took Haruka&#39;s hand in her own and kissed the back of it,
then stood up. &quot;Are you coming?&quot;. Haruka looked up at her and and
answered the smile that greeted her with one of her own. She got up and
followed her down the hall to the bedroom.

Michiru stood beside the bed, her eyes locked with Haruka&#39;s. She reached
up and unpinned her hair and shook it out around her shoulders. She
lifted it up and turned around. &quot;I can&#39;t get this zipper. Would you get
it for me?&quot;. Haruka walked up behind her and tugged the zipper down,
then slid the fabric away from her body. It puddled on the floor around
Michiru&#39;s feet. She stepped out of it and tossed it on a nearby chair.
Then she turned back to face Haruka. Now she was clad in a lowcut,
black, strapless bra and a skimpy pair of black panties and thigh-high
stockings. She laid back on the bed and looked up at Haruka with a huge
grin on her face. &quot;Now you&quot;.

Haruka, who had been completely mesmerised by the sight of Michiru,
slowly unbuttoned the white shirt she wore and slipped it off, revealing
her smaller, firm breasts. The pink nipples had hardened slightly. She
unfastened her trousers and slid them down, then stepped over to the
bed. She began to remove her brief, white panties. &quot;No.&quot;, Michiru said
quietly, &quot;I want to do it.&quot; She smiled up at her and patted the space
next to her. Haruka laid down next to her and put an arm around her
waist.

Michiru got up on all fours and crawled over Haruka&#39;s body. She leaned
over and nibbled gently at Haruka&#39;s lower lip and traced the outline of
her lips with her tongue. Haruka parted her lips slightly and Michiru
kissed her, snaking her tongue inside her mouth. She laced her fingers
with Haruka&#39;s and began to kiss at her throat. Michiru&#39;s hair hung down
like a curtain and brushed against Haruka&#39;s skin as she moved. Haruka
closed her eyes and sighed softly as Michiru moved down her throat to
her collarbone. Michiru smiled as she bent to kiss the upper slope of
Haruka&#39;s breasts. She lay on top of her now, pressing her body against
Haruka&#39;s as she covered her breasts with kisses. She bent her head over
one and began to suck gently at it. Haruka arched her back in pleasure.
Michiru released one hand and brought hers down to caress the other,
paying special attention to the puckered nipple. Haruka began to ache
and she started rubbing against Michiru slightly. Michiru brought her
head up and gazed down at Haruka&#39;s face. &quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; She nudged
one leg between Haruka&#39;s partially spread ones and began to rub it
against her. Haruka gasped. &quot;Michiru...please...&quot;. Michiru grinned and
began to kiss her lover&#39;s flat stomach. &quot;I&#39;m getting there Haruka. You
must learn patience.&quot; She kissed the skin just above the waistband of
her panties from one hip to the other, then kissed her through the
cotton fabric. Haruka shifted, slightly bumping her groin against
Michiru&#39;s face. &quot;You are the eager one aren&#39;t you my love?&quot; she said as
she pulled Haruka&#39;s panties over her hips and down, tossing them away.
She pushed her legs apart and began to stroke her long, muscular legs.
&quot;You are so beautiful Haruka.&quot; She leaned down and trailed kisses up and
down her inner thighs. Then she moved upward to the pale golden patch of
hair that lay between her legs. She nuzzled her there and then kissed
her clit. Haruka sighed as she felt Michiru&#39;s tongue probe the area
hidden within the delicate folds of skin. She clutched at the bedspread
beneath her. Moans, louder now than before, escaped from Haruka&#39;s lips
as Michiru began to suck and lick at her. She arched her back, gasping
when Michiru moved slightly lower and flicked her tongue into her.
Michiru sat up and looked at her. &quot;I know what you would like even
better.&quot; Then she thrust her long fingers inside her. Haruka shifted her
hips forward against her hand, meeting every thrust of Michiru&#39;s
fingers, increasing her speed when Michiru did. &quot;Michiru!&quot;, she cried
out over and over as she came.

Michiru crawled back over her lover&#39;s body and stood on all fours over
her. She gazed into her eyes and slowly began to lick at the fingers
that had just been inside Haruka. &quot;You taste so sweet, Haruka. It&#39;s no
wonder that I love you.&quot; She smiled at her and leaned down to kiss her.
Haruka wrapped her arms around her and kissed her back passionately. She
rolled over with her and studied the fine contours of Michiru&#39;s face.
She pressed her lips to her cheek and then to her ear. She whispered &quot;I
love you too Michiru. I know I probably don&#39;t tell you that too much,
but I do.&quot; She buried her face against her shoulder and kissed it then
sat back up to look at her. She looked down into Michiru&#39;s eyes,
sparkling with unshed tears. &quot;Let me show you how much.&quot; She brushed her
lips against Michiru&#39;s and then moved them down her throat, inhaling
deeply of the perfume that lingered there. She removed the bra and bent
over her breasts, suckling one, then the other. Michiru twisted her
fingers through Haruka&#39;s hair and closed her eyes, revelling in the feel
of Haruka&#39;s lips, and then her fingers, on her skin.

Haruka kissed and caressed the slender expanse of Michiru&#39;s waist,
slowly moving lower down her body. She removed the black panties and
tossed them to the floor. Then she stretched out between Michiru&#39;s legs
and slid her hands under her thighs, resting them on her shoulders. She
buried her face against soft flesh before her and began to nibble gently
at the folds around her clit. Michiru moaned softly as Haruka traced the
contours of those folds with the tip of her tongue and then darted it
over her clit. She sucked and nibbled lightly at the sensitive flesh
avidly, relishing the sounds of Michiru&#39;s moans as they rang through the
room. She plunged her tongue inside her, her teeth rubbing over her
clit. Michiru bucked against her face when she felt Haruka&#39;s tongue
enter her. Haruka gripped her hips with her strong musician&#39;s hands to
keep her still as she continued probing the sweet cavity with her
tongue. Michiru writhed on the bed as waves of pleasure radiated from
her center. She shuddered slightly as she came. Haruka laid beside her
on the bed and cradled her in her arms. Michiru laid her head on
Haruka&#39;s chest and listened to the calm beat of her heart. length, she
rose up to look into her lover&#39;s light blue eyes. Haruka brushed her
fingers across Michiru&#39;s face and smiled. &quot;I will never leave you like
that again.&quot; Michiru said as she leaned down to give her a kiss. &quot;We
must never part bitterly like that again. Do you promise me?&quot; Her calm
blue eyes met Haruka&#39;s. Haruka nodded. &quot;Never again. And I will keep
that promise.&quot; She pulled her close and hugged her. Michiru laid her
head back down on Haruka&#39;s chest and the two soon fell asleep in each
other&#39;s arms.
