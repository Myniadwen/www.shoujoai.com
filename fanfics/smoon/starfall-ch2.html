fanfiction by <a href="../authors/bakagaijin.html">Baka Gaijin30</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/starfall-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Author&#39;s Notes: In case anyone&#39;s wondering why I&#39;m having the action on 
Earth take place in Edo instead of Tokyo like it did in the original 
series, there&#39;s a very simple answer to that: they&#39;re both the same 
place. This story takes place in the past, and prior to the Meiji era 
the capitol of Japan was Kyoto, and Edo was a port city most famous for 
being the residence of the Shogun. Emperor Meiji moved the capital to 
Edo during his reign and renamed the city Tokyo (Eastern Capital). Since 
none of that happened until the nineteenth century though (long after 
the Silver Millennium), it&#39;s Edo for this story.

Also, this story will take place during the Jomon Period (14000 BCE to 
300 BCE), long before the rise of the Shogun.

-II-

Lord Umino Gurio was a nervous wreck.

In a contest of physical skill held a year earlier, the Islands of Japan 
won the right to host Princess Serenity II and the Princesses of the 
Inner Court. Later, much to the consternation of the Emperor of Japan in 
Kyoto, the Moon Kingdom asked that he allow a drawing to take place to 
see where in Japan the second to the royal throne of the great Moon 
Kingdom would stay.

The lot fell upon Edo, a port city known for its trade and fishing as 
well as its militarily strategic position. As the daimyo, the feudal 
lord of the commercial city, the heavy responsibility for entertaining 
and housing the princesses fell upon Gurio&#39;s shoulders. The near-sighted 
young man nervously stood outside the small castle his family left him, 
hoping its diminutive size wouldn&#39;t be seen as insulting to his imperial 
visitors. As one of his advisors informed him that the sun dial signaled 
the time was near, he visibly began to shake.

&quot;Gurio dear, calm down,&quot; his wife Naru said as she put a comforting hand 
on his shoulder, &quot;Everything will be alright, you&#39;ll see.&quot; She smiled 
reassuringly as the sun hit the green bow in her auburn hair.

&quot;I... I hope so. But what if they&#39;re not used to sleeping on mats like 
we are? I hear there are lands in which people sleep on cushions that 
stand above the ground, and eat at tall tables with chairs rather than 
on tables close to the floor, and...&quot; he was cut off as a bright glowing 
light appeared before his wife and himself. Shortly thereafter, Princess 
Serenity II and her guardians, the princesses of the Inner Court, 
appeared. Gurio and his wife, as well as his advisors, stared in awe at 
the beautiful princess who, as second in line to the throne, carried 
with her the symbol of her royalty, the Spiral Heart Moon Rod. Her 
clothes were shining white, and her beautiful blue eyes had a kindly 
look to them. The royal crescent moon mark was plainly present on her 
forehead, and at her feet stood her advisors, Luna and Artemis.

From behind the beautiful princess, the vested Priestess oracle of Mars 
stepped forward, bowed respectfully to the daimyo and his wife, both of 
whom reverently bowed their heads and joined their hands together as she 
blessed them both. Mars then stepped back to join the other princesses 
behind Serenity II.

The young Gurio was speechless; never before had he seen such beauty, or 
such high nobility. A tap on his shoulder from Naru brought him back to 
reality. &quot;Ah, um... Most noble Princess Serenity, I&#39;m Umino Gurio, and 
my wife Naru and I...&quot;

&quot;Is that where you live?&quot; the princess asked, inadvertently interrupting 
the nervous lord.

&quot;Um, yes my princess.&quot;

&quot;Your castle is so small...&quot; she muttered, quickly adding &quot;I love it!&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Gurio asked, the corners of his mouth beginning to turn upward 
in relief.

Serenity II nodded her head with a smile, &quot;It&#39;s adorable; it&#39;s just like 
a little dollhouse, only it&#39;s big enough to live in. My daughter would 
have loved to have seen it too, I&#39;m sure.&quot;

Naru bowed, &quot;You honor us, Serenity-sama.&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; the princess said, &quot;Call me Serena, everybody else does. Oh,&quot; 
she gasped as she came over and put her hand on the sleeve of Naru&#39;s 
dress, &quot;This material is so beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you... Serena,&quot; Naru said with a slight blush, &quot;It&#39;s called 
&#39;silk.&#39;&quot;

&quot;Really? Well, let&#39;s go inside this cute little castle of yours and you 
can tell me all about it. By the way, is your husband ill?&quot;

&quot;No, your highness,&quot; Naru answered truthfully, &quot;He&#39;s simply nervous.&quot;

&quot;He shouldn&#39;t be,&quot; Serena said cheerfully as she smiled at Naru, &quot;After 
all, I have the feeling that we&#39;re all going to be great friends, don&#39;t 
you?&quot; turning back, the princess waved to Gurio, &quot;Gurio-sama, aren&#39;t you 
going to give me a tour of your lovely home?&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; he asked, still taken off guard by the princess&#39; friendly and 
familiar tone, &quot;Oh, right! Of course!&quot; he said as he ran after the 
princess and his wife.

Looking on, Luna allowed a chuckle, &quot;That&#39;s our Serena,&quot; she said, &quot;Not 
here even five minutes and already she&#39;s best friends with the local 
daimyo and his wife.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d call her a master diplomat,&quot; Artemis observed, &quot;Except it isn&#39;t 
diplomacy with her, it&#39;s simply the way she is.&quot; The two cats followed 
their princess, and the four members of the Inner court followed after 
them. Finally, Lord Gurio&#39;s servants brought up the rear, the last one 
making sure to close the door to the castle behind him.

------

Pluto stood silently before the Eternity Main System, the advanced 
supercomputer housed within the palace of the Moon Kingdom. She closed 
her eyes and allowed her shoulders to slump as she leaned her head 
against her time staff. Hundreds of years from now, on a small island 
nation on Earth, a poet and playwright would make the observation that 
all the world&#39;s a stage, and all it&#39;s men and women merely players. Lady 
Pluto already knew that though, just as she knew of the grand 
performance about to take place. It was her responsibility, and her 
curse, to be the Guardian of the Time Gate.

It wasn&#39;t so much that she was just acting out a prewritten script that 
upset Pluto at times like these, but rather the burden of knowing what 
was coming, of having the script itself memorized by heart and lacking 
the ability to alter or stop the performance. Act one was already 
playing out; Serena and the Inner Court were on Earth, Endymion and 
Usagi were gone, and she and the others left on the Moon were blissfully 
enjoying the week of celebrations. It was the knowledge of what lay 
ahead in the next few acts of the drama about to play out that made her 
stomach sink.

As she continued to stand before the supercomputer, lost in her 
thoughts, she was joined by Luna and Artemis&#39; daughter Diana. The small 
grey kitten looked at the Princess with concern. &quot;Pluto-sama, is 
everything alright?&quot; she asked, &quot;You look sad.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t talk about it,&quot; the statuesque princess muttered, her dark 
green bangs casting a shadow over her closed eyes.

&quot;Why not? Sometimes it helps to share your troubles with another, like 
Princess Usagi does with me. If it&#39;s because you&#39;re afraid of my telling 
others your secrets...&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; she responded, barely paying any attention whatsoever to what she 
was saying, &quot;It&#39;s because it hasn&#39;t happened yet.&quot;

Diana tilted her head at the response, &quot;What? Pluto-sama, I don&#39;t 
understand. What hasn&#39;t happened yet?&quot;

&quot;The warning,&quot; she whispered.

&quot;Warning? What warning?&quot;

&quot;The warning that hasn&#39;t happened yet. The one the Eternity Main Frame 
will send out.&quot;

The kitten began to grow concerned. &quot;Pluto-sama, if there&#39;s to be a 
warning, then we&#39;d best tell everybody right away!&quot; she declared.

Princess Pluto finally opened her eyes and, seeing the tiny grey kitten 
at her feet, smiled. &quot;Tell them?&quot; she asked as she bent down to look 
closer at young Usagi&#39;s advisor, &quot;Tell them what?&quot;

&quot;Of the danger facing the kingdom.&quot;

Pluto raised an eyebrow, &quot;What danger?&quot;

Diana looked up at Pluto in disbelief. &quot;What danger? The Eternity Main 
System...&quot;

&quot;The Eternity Main System hasn&#39;t warned us of any danger,&quot; she said with 
a bemused expression, &quot;You can see for yourself that everything&#39;s 
normal. What are you going on about?&quot;

&quot;But it will. You just said...&quot;

&quot;As I recall,&quot; Pluto interrupted, &quot;All I said was that I couldn&#39;t talk 
about what was bothering me because it hadn&#39;t happened yet.&quot;

&quot;But... But if you know what it is that is going to happen...&quot;

&quot;How can I know if it has yet to happen?&quot;

The thoroughly confused kitten looked up at Lady Pluto for a few seconds 
before shaking her head and walking away. As the Keeper of the Gates of 
Time watched the befuddled feline wander off, she allowed a melancholy 
sigh to escape. She turned to leave, heading for the garden. She would 
shortly run into Saturn, and soon after that the two would innocently 
wander into the greenhouse together and catch Uranus and Neptune in an 
intimate embrace. There would be teasing followed by laughter, after 
which all four would head back inside the palace for tea.

Princess Pluto turned off the light, shut the door behind her, and 
headed for the garden.

------

The two women and the cat walked side by side down the stone path to the 
bottom of the hill, Naru smiling and nodding away as Princess Serenity 
continued to talk away about how beautiful and green everything was 
here. She didn&#39;t act anything like Naru would&#39;ve expected, there was no 
air of stuffiness or self-importance about her. Rather, she was 
remarkably down to earth, sincere, and friendly.

&quot;Sereni... Sorry, Serena-sama,&quot; Naru corrected herself, &quot;Are you sure 
your guardians don&#39;t mind staying behind while we&#39;re out here?&quot;

&quot;Of course not,&quot; the princess responded, &quot;If they&#39;re needed, I can call 
upon them. Besides,&quot; she said with a wink, &quot;I&#39;ve been known to defend 
myself in a fight when necessary.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Luna spoke up, &quot;But I still wish you&#39;d at least brought Lady 
Venus with you.&quot;

Princess Serenity was about to respond, when Naru turned happily to her 
and pointed at a small stone bridge ahead of them, &quot;We&#39;re here.&quot; As the 
three reached the middle of the bridge, they looked over its side to see 
gold, white, and multi-colored koi fish swimming about in the shallow 
waters.

&quot;Oh, Naru-chan,&quot; Serenity gasped, &quot;They&#39;re beautiful.&quot;

Naru found herself blushing a bit at being referred to by -chan, usually 
only used between close friends, rather than the honorifics -san or 
&#150;sama that protocol would&#39;ve called for. As Usagi continued to watch the 
large fish swim around, the auburn-haired lady of the castle looked 
questioningly over to the imperial advisor.

Luna simply smiled back. &quot;It&#39;s okay,&quot; the cat reassured, &quot;She likes 
you.&quot;

Naru relaxed a bit at hearing that, and pulled out two small leather 
sacks filled with bits of food to feed the fish with. She passed one to 
Serenity, and watched as the princess squealed with joy at the way the 
fish swam around trying to catch the food. Her laughter was infectious, 
and soon she found herself giggling along with the princess. Soon 
however, the fish food ran out.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Naru said, &quot;Wait here and I&#39;ll go get us some more from 
the castle.&quot;

&quot;Alright,&quot; Serenity responded with a smile, adding, &quot;Hurry back though.&quot;

As Naru left, Princess Serenity&#39;s smile faded a bit. &quot;Serena?&quot; Luna 
asked, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; she answered a bit wistfully, &quot;Just missing Endymion and 
Usagi, I guess.&quot;

Luna leapt onto the stone railing of the bridge, &quot;I understand, I miss 
my little Diana too. Your mom and Neherenia-mama probably are missing 
you too right now.&quot;

Serena nodded her head, &quot;Comes with the territory of being a mother, I 
guess.&quot; She was lost in her thoughts, staring off at the koi swimming 
below her. As she continued to watch absently, a shadow passed across 
the water and someone stepped up next to her. The princess quickly 
smiled once again, &quot;You&#39;re back with more food already?&quot; she asked 
happily as she turned to face her new friend, &quot;Good, we can...&quot; her 
voice died off as she realized it wasn&#39;t Naru at all, but a young man 
with jet-black hair pulled back into a long ponytail and wearing the 
distinctive garb of a traveling bard. &quot;Oh! Hello.&quot;

&quot;Hello yourself,&quot; the brash young man said with a smile. Looking over 
her white dress and her golden hair pulled up into odangos, he guessed 
her to be a foreigner. &quot;So, have you traveled far to hear us?&quot;

Princess Serenity looked perplexed, &quot;I don&#39;t understand, who are you?&quot;

The bard was taken aback, &quot;Y... You mean you don&#39;t know of me, or my 
fellow performers? We&#39;re staying here in this province for a while to 
perform, haven&#39;t you heard anything of it?&quot; taking her blank expression 
for a &quot;no,&quot; he frowned, &quot;I guess we&#39;re not as popular as I thought,&quot; he 
muttered.

Suddenly, Serenity smirked at the youth. &quot;Oh, now I understand,&quot; she 
said, &quot;This must be a new way of approaching girls. Young man, I&#39;m a 
wife and mother, to say nothing of the fact I&#39;m several years your 
senior, and...&quot; she was cut off by the young man&#39;s laughter.

&quot;You&#39;re funny,&quot; he said as he turned to leave. Walking off the bridge, 
he called over his shoulder, &quot;See you later, dumpling.&quot;

Princess Serenity began to seethe, &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; she snapped at 
Luna, &quot;What impertinence! Nobody outside of Endymion has ever had the 
nerve to call me &#39;dumpling.&#39;&quot;

As Luna tried her best to sooth Serenity&#39;s wounded pride, back at the 
castle the four Princesses of the Inner Court were keeping themselves 
occupied. Princess Venus came into the castle kitchen wearing her white 
fuku top with white shoulder armor, an orange bow on her chest and red 
stripes running along the sides of her top. Her bottom was a small blue 
dress with red trim and black shoes with ankle straps, and around her 
waste she wore her chain of hearts. She found Princess Jupiter wearing a 
beautiful green silk kimono provided her by Lord Gurio and Lady Naru, 
sipping tea from an earthen cup.

The Senshi Princess of Thunder and Courage raised an eyebrow at seeing 
her fellow princess in battle attire, &quot;Are you planning on a fight?&quot; 
Jupiter asked.

Venus smirked, &quot;I&#39;m the head of the Inner Court,&quot; she answered, &quot;I&#39;m 
duty-bound to always be on-guard.&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Jupiter answered as she took another sip of her tea. &quot;Would 
you like some?&quot; she offered, &quot;It would be no trouble to fix you a bit.&quot;

&quot;Tea sounds nice,&quot; Venus answered.

Princess Jupiter took some tea leaves and placed them at the bottom of a 
cup for her fellow royal. &quot;By the way,&quot; she said as she poured hot water 
into the cup, &quot;I understand you were there to receive Mars when she 
arrived yesterday. How was Her Holiness?&quot;

&quot;Distant.&quot;

Jupiter looked up at that to see a sad look in Venus&#39; normally cheerful 
blue eyes, &quot;Venus, I...&quot;

&quot;Please,&quot; Venus interrupted, &quot;Spare me. She has her duty, I have mine. 
Let&#39;s just leave it at that.&quot;

Jupiter looked at her friend silently for a few seconds before slowly 
nodding her head and passing her cup of tea to her. As they both drank 
in silence, in another room of Lord Gurio&#39;s small castle Mercury played 
a game of checkers with Mars. The Princess of Wisdom was dressed in a 
semi-formal ice-blue gown that was not quite as fancy as the one she&#39;d 
worn in the Moon Palace the day before. As she waited for her opponent 
to make her move, Artemis strode in.

&quot;Lady Mercury, Your Holiness, have either of you seen Venus?&quot;

&quot;I think I saw her headed for the kitchen,&quot; Mars answered. Once Artemis 
left, Mercury leaned forward over the game board, &quot;Your Holiness, have 
you had the chance to work things out with Venus yet?&quot;

Mars ignored the question as she moved her red piece. Mercury moved 
hers, and Mars took her piece. &quot;Your Holiness,&quot; Mercury said softly, 
&quot;She still loves you.&quot;

Mars let out a heavy sigh, &quot;I know,&quot; she admitted, &quot;But we all know it 
can never be.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Mercury said sympathetically, &quot;Your holy vows. Your Holiness, 
just what would happen if you renounced them?&quot;

&quot;Well, first I&#39;d have to renounce my holy position, then I would be 
stripped of the royal Martian crown and would become a commoner. I&#39;d 
quite possibly be banished from my home world as well...&quot;

&quot;Venus would accept Your Holiness into her home planet,&quot; Mercury pointed 
out hopefully.

Mars looked up at Mercury, &quot;I am the Princess of Mars,&quot; she said, &quot;I am 
also the High Priestess and Oracle of the Solar System. I can&#39;t simply 
ask to renounce all that because I find the demands of celibacy and 
perpetual virginity to be difficult. Fate has demanded this of me, and 
no one, not even I, can defy the fates. Now please, let&#39;s change the 
subject.&quot;

Mercury lowered her eyes, &quot;I&#39;m sorry Your Holiness.&quot;

Mars sat back in her chair, &quot;It&#39;s alright,&quot; she said. &quot;Anyways, how are 
you and Lady Jupiter doing?&quot;

Mercury looked surprised, &quot;How did Your Holiness know...&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m an oracle, remember?&quot; Mars said.

Mercury blushed as she looked down at the game board, &quot;Well, we were 
going to wait until the end of the week to announce our intentions.&quot;

&quot;Indeed?&quot; Mars asked, &quot;So who asked who?&quot;

&quot;She asked me last spring. We were hoping Your Holiness would perform 
the ceremony.&quot;

&quot;Of course, it would be an honor,&quot; she answered. After a few more 
minutes of playing, she looked outside a nearby window, &quot;Where&#39;s Serena? 
She should&#39;ve been back by now.&quot;

Mercury looked outside as well, &quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; she said reassuringly, 
&quot;I&#39;m sure everything&#39;s fine. If she needed us, she would&#39;ve sent for 
us.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re probably right,&quot; Mars said thoughtfully, &quot;Besides, I sensed no 
sort of danger when we arrived. I&#39;m sure she&#39;s fine, just like you 
said.&quot;

------

Naru hurried along the path as fast as her feet could take her. It had 
taken awhile to get back to the castle, grab more fish food, and rush 
back. As she ran along with the food, a petite white figure with large 
mouse-like ears jumped out from behind a bush, causing the auburn-haired 
wife of the daimyo to let out a surprised screech of fright.

&quot;Luna,&quot; Princess Serenity said as she heard the cry, &quot;What was that?&quot;

&quot;We should call the others,&quot; the black cat advised.

&quot;No time,&quot; the princess said, clutching her Moon Rod in her hand as she 
ran towards the noise, &quot;Whoever it is sounds close.&quot;

&quot;Serena, wait!&quot; Luna cried as she ran after her. The princess ran faster 
as she heard a much louder, painful scream, taking off from the ground 
as translucent wings formed from her back. Coming over a small hill, she 
saw a nasty looking small woman dressed in a white outfit, with large 
mouse ears sticking out of the top of her head. In front of her knelt 
Lady Naru, a flower opening out of her forehead with a silver crystal 
floating above its petals. As the crystal turned black, the strange 
woman pouted.

&quot;Aw... And I thought for sure that an aristocrat like her would&#39;ve had a 
Star Seed,&quot; she said disappointedly.

&quot;Stop right there!&quot; Princess Serenity shouted, &quot;What are you doing to 
Lady Naru?&quot;

The mouse-like woman turned to look at her, &quot;Oh goodness! You&#39;re a 
Senshi, too?&quot; she asked.

Serenity was caught off guard, &quot;Another Senshi?&quot; The princess narrowed 
her eyes as she stepped forward, &quot;Who are you?&quot;

The stranger smiled smugly, &quot;I&#39;m Senshi Iron Mouse.&quot; Looking back over 
at Naru, her smile widened, &quot;I&#39;m finished with today&#39;s business. Would 
you like to play with the phage?&quot;

Before Princess Serenity had time to react, Naru became encircled in 
strands of dark energy. Her form changed, her eyes turning a shade of 
blood-red as fish scales formed all over her body. Her now webbed 
fingers ended in claws, and a pair of gill slits appeared just behind 
her jaw line.&quot;

&quot;Senshi fishmonger!&quot; the phage cried out.

&quot;N... Naru?&quot; Serenity gasped.

&quot;Everyone who looses the brightness of their Star Seed becomes a phage,&quot; 
Iron Mouse chuckled as a diminutive pup tent appeared behind her. 
Quickly entering the tent, she called out &quot;Have fun!&quot; as both she and 
the tent disappeared.

&quot;Wait!&quot; Princess Serenity exclaimed.

&quot;You don&#39;t look so healthy, princess,&quot; the phage said, &quot;Maybe you should 
add some fish oil to your diet.&quot;

Serena looked questioningly back over to the thing that was once Naru. 
She had just enough time to duck out of the way as the phage shot a 
mucous-like, oily translucent substance at her. It landed on a patch of 
grass, which instantly turned brown and withered.

&quot;Luna, look out!&quot; Serenity shrieked as she grabbed her advisor and leapt 
out of the way of another of the phage&#39;s disgusting attacks.

&quot;Serena, you have to fight her!&quot; Luna yelled, the royal advisor starting 
to panic.

&quot;I can&#39;t!&quot; Serenity cried, &quot;She used to be Lady Naru!&quot; The princess 
heart was beating rapidly now as she quickly tried to figure out her 
options. As she was gearing up to avoid yet another new attack, both she 
and the phage suddenly heard the sound of fingers snapping. Turning her 
head, Princess Serenity saw three figures dressed in skintight black 
outfits standing on a large rock near the woods.

&quot;Penetrating the darkness at night...&quot;
&quot;The air of freedom breaks through...&quot;
&quot;We are the three sacred shooting stars...&quot;

&quot;Senshi Star Fighter!&quot;

&quot;Senshi Star Maker!&quot;

&quot;Senshi Star Healer!&quot;

&quot;Senshi Starlights... Are here!&quot;

Serenity looked at the three newcomers in disbelief. &quot;More Senshi?&quot;

&quot;Ah, more unhealthy specimens,&quot; the phage said as she readied to attack 
the three newcomers. Before she could though, the Senshi who called 
herself Star Fighter stepped forward.

&quot;Star serious laser!&quot; she yelled out as a focused light blast shot forth 
from her hand, striking the phage and causing it to cry out in pain. The 
thing collapsed as smoke rose from its body.

Star Fighter looked gravely down at her adversary, &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said 
as she prepared to deliver a death blow, &quot;This is the only way I know to 
bring you comfort now.&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Princess Serenity cried, placing herself between the phage and the 
Starlights, &quot;Don&#39;t kill Naru!&quot;

Star Fighter looked surprised. &quot;You,&quot; she whispered, recognizing the 
woman she&#39;d seen earlier on the bridge.

Noting that her leader seemed at a loss, Star Healer spoke up. &quot;It&#39;s too 
late now. The &#39;Naru&#39; you knew is already dead.&quot;

&quot;Once humans become a phage, we can&#39;t save them.&quot; Star Maker added.

&quot;Right... Except that person...&quot; Starfighter muttered. She quickly 
focused her attention back on the phage behind the princess. &quot;Now go 
away,&quot; she ordered.

&quot;No,&quot; Serenity said defiantly.

&quot;Go away!&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; the princess yelled, the yellow crescent moon on her forehead 
shining brightly upon the three Senshi. She didn&#39;t know what she could 
do, or how, but she knew she couldn&#39;t simply allow her new friend to 
die, not like this. In the moment of concern and fear for Naru, the 
Spiral Heart Moon Rod she&#39;d been clutching glowed a bright pink and 
changed shape in her hands.

She faced the phage, the creature was still kneeling on the ground 
immobilized by Star Fighter&#39;s attack. &quot;Kami-sama,&quot; she whispered, &quot;Give 
me the words.&quot; Twirling the newly transformed wand in her hands, she 
aimed it at the thing and blurted out the first words that came to mind.

&quot;Starlight honeymoon therapy kiss!&quot;

There was a flash of pink light, followed by a strong wind and what 
looked like thousands of white feathers flowing around the phage. The 
creature stretched out her arms and shrieked, &quot;Beautiful!&quot; In an 
instant, the creature turned to Naru again, the flower once more 
appearing out of her forehead as the black crystal was restored to its 
original silver color. The crystal floated back down into the flower, 
which then closed its petals up and was absorbed back into Naru&#39;s 
forehead. The young wife of the daimyo fell to the ground unconscious. 
Serenity quickly ran to her, holding her new friend tightly in her arms 
as she looked over her shoulder.

The Senshi Starlights were gone.

&quot;Serena,&quot; Luna asked, &quot;Is she alright?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; the princess answered. &quot;Go back and tell Jupiter that Naru 
fainted. Ask her to come back here and help me get Naru-chan back to the 
castle. Don&#39;t tell her or the others any more than that though.&quot;

&quot;What? But Serena...&quot;

&quot;Until we know more what&#39;s going on, I&#39;m not sure it wise to discuss too 
much about this. Now hurry,&quot; she said, cradling Lady Naru&#39;s head in her 
lap as the cat ran off.

------

Several hours later, long after Jupiter and Princess Serenity managed to 
get Naru back home and in bed, the last of the castle&#39;s servant blew out 
the last lantern, casting all in darkness as all slept soundly. Outside 
the castle, three men quickly snuck onto the grounds. They wore the 
rough common clothes of the peasantry, and on their foreheads they wore 
upside down inverted crescent moons made of soot and charcoal. One 
carried what looked like a scarecrow while another carried a large 
rolled-up sheet of white cloth. As the third member of the group acted 
as lookout, his two companions quickly climbed up into a large tree 
behind the castle.

------

Princess Jupiter woke up the next morning early, hoping to surprise her 
hosts and fellow royals by fixing them a large breakfast. She was a 
Senshi, a warrior, only when she had to be. Back at her home on Io and 
when she visited the royal court on the Moon, she loved nothing better 
than to be in a kitchen, making delicious meals for herself and her 
friends, especially for her Mercury. Once, long ago, she&#39;d loved 
Nephrite, and had her heart broken when he betrayed her and her Queen. 
It was Mercury who helped to heal her broken heart, and it was Mercury 
who showed her she could love again.

She remembered that there was a pile of firewood behind the castle, and 
walked around the building to grab some to heat the stove with.

That&#39;s when she saw it.

It was a large cloth banner hanging up from the branches of a tree, on 
the top of which were written the names of Queen Beryl and the four 
Shittenou. Under the names, in bold calligraphy, it read &quot;Remember our 
martyrs, down with the moon whore!&quot;

Next to the banner was a figure made of tree bark, rope and straw to 
look like Princess Serenity, hung in effigy from an outlying branch.

Princess Jupiter was aghast; who could&#39;ve possibly written something so 
vile about Serena, or wish harm to such a sweet princess, wife and 
mother? Hearing a horrified gasp behind her, she turned to see Lady Naru 
exiting the back of the castle, a mortified expression on her face as 
she looked from the banner to the princess. &quot;M... My lady,&quot; she 
stammered out, &quot;I&#39;m terribly sorry, I don&#39;t know how this could&#39;ve 
happened.&quot;

Jupiter walked over to the daimyo&#39;s wife, &quot;Naru-san, why? Why would 
anyone do this?&quot;

&quot;They are probably separatists, my lady,&quot; she answered, adding, &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry. This has brought dishonor upon my household...&quot;

&quot;Not if no one else ever sees it,&quot; Jupiter answered as she turned away 
from Naru and focused her attention on the banner again. &quot;My guardian 
Jupiter,&quot; she said as she crossed her arms before her chest and extended 
her index and pinky fingers, &quot;Brew a storm! Call the clouds! Bring down 
the lightning!&quot; With that, storm clouds appeared in the sky seemingly 
out of nowhere as a small rod extended from her princess&#39; tiara.

&quot;Supreme Thunder!&quot; she cried out as lighting shot down from the sky, 
struck the rod, and passed through the princess and out of her extended 
arms. In a flash it struck both the banner and the effigy, burning them 
to ashes and leaving dark scorch marks behind on the tree itself.

&quot;Say nothing of any of this to the others,&quot; Jupiter said as she turned 
back around to face Naru, &quot;The dishonor was not yours anyways, but 
whoever it was that hung that up there.&quot;

Naru stared wide eyed at the tall princess before her. True, she knew 
the stories passed down about how powerful the Moon Kingdom was, but to 
physically see a woman stand not ten feet away from you call down 
lightning and then send it out under her control was more than a little 
bit frightening. &quot;Yes, my lady,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I&#39;ll tell no one.&quot;

Jupiter watched as the now fearful Naru hurried back into her husband&#39;s 
castle. She then picked up several pieces of firewood from the pile and 
headed back inside herself. Later, everyone made it a point to 
compliment the princess on the fine breakfast she fixed for them all.

Everyone except Naru, who remained strangely quiet throughout breakfast 
and most of the rest of the morning.

-To Be Continued-

End Notes: This series may have more of a manga or PGSM feel to it than 
the anime version, and that&#39;s largely due to the manga having much more 
information about the Silver Millennium than the anime, and the fact 
that I liked some of the characterizations of the live action version 
better than the anime. Also, this is an alternate reality, and I find 
that by basing my characterizations more on both the manga and the live 
action PGSM versions of Sailor moon I&#39;m able to get an effect where the 
characters feel familiar but just a tad bit off. Venus, for example, is 
based almost solely on her PGSM incarnation, with the only carryover 
from her anime version being her occasional slip-up of a saying (and 
yes, her Senshi uniform is that of Sailor V, with the chain of hearts 
belt coming from PGSM). Mars is a combination of her PGSM version, the 
Oracle of Delphi, and the Pope, whereas Pluto is solely her manga 
version, down to her belt of keys they left out of the anime.

I&#39;m glad everyone&#39;s enjoying the series, and I hope to have the next 
update up soon And don&#39;t worry, the Outers as well as Queens Serenity 
and Neherenia will have much more of a role next time.</pre>
