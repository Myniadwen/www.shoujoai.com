<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 5 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><p>It wasn’t until early morning that Rei dragged herself back to Minako’s room. Weary and 
tired, the Martian leader hesitated just outside the entrance in a set of casual wear. She 
secretly hoped that Minako had already fallen asleep; then the whole silliness could be 
avoided altogether. Yes, instead of marching into mysterious, unknown territory during the 
middle of the night she could go to her own bed chamber and have a long peaceful 
sleep.</p><p><i>But nooooo… I gave her my word. </i>Rei inwardly groaned. She resisted the 
urge to lay her head against the door frame and sob. After fighting in a war, wandering 
through a blazing desert, and running through the capital’s crowded streets, she just had to 
go and start the training sessions for the new recruits. And where did it lead her? What was 
the reward? Here, in front of a diplomat’s door late at night to play babysitter/teddy 
bear(?). And from what little she knew about the person’s personality, she doubted that she 
was guaranteed much sleep.</p><p><i>Minako’s so childish! I bet as soon as I walk in she 
would want to have a pillow fight or something else stupid like that. </i>Rei cringed 
against the imaginary blow of the soft pillow to her head. <i>Or perhaps she’ll want to play 
a game of hide and go seek. Heaven forbid it. I don’t think I have the patience or the 
energy to put up with that kind of game. Maybe I should just tie her to the bed and command 
her to go to sleep? Yeah, like that would work well. </i></p><p>Gathering what little energy 
she had left, Rei brought up a hesitant hand and rapped the door lightly. The knuckles of 
her hand had barely brushed the barrier, making only the lightest of noise.</p><p>No 
response.</p><p>“Oh well, I guess she’s already asleep. That’s too bad,” Rei shrugged and 
backed away from the door. She was about to turn around and leave when a very cold shiver 
ran down her spine. It was called a “conscience”. It’s that little annoying voice in your 
head that always has a bone to pick with you when you’re about to do something ‘wrong’. And 
Rei’s wasn’t about to let the grown woman walk away in peace.</p><p><i>You said you would 
stay with her…</i> It poked and nagged. <i>Are you going to leave a defenceless, little girl 
without her teddy bear sleep alone?</i></p><p>“…” <i>She’s a Goddess, not some defenceless 
little girl. </i>Rei retorted.<i> Besides, who needs to sleep with a teddy bear at night at 
that age? She must be at least nearing twenty already!</i></p><p><i>But she has feelings 
too. Goddesses are also human, or have you already forgotten about the others so 
quickly?</i></p><p>“…” The Martian shifted her feet on the spot uncomfortably at the 
mention.</p><p><i>Well, no, but… hey, why am I arguing with myself anyway?! This is 
absolutely ridiculous! I’m just tired. So I’ll just ignore you now and go back to bed 
and--</i></p><p><i>Don’t tell me that you’re a COWARD?</i></p><p><i>W-H-A-T?</i></p><p>“Ok, 
I’ll show you who’s a coward!” Rei snarled at the imaginary opponent. Whirling on the spot 
she kicked open Minako’s room door with such a force that the thing nearly fell off its 
hinges as it flew into a back wall.</p><p><i><b>SLAM! Tinkle, tinkle…</b></i></p><p>Rei 
stared into the room with her mouth slightly agape as the door slowly re-traced its 
path.</p><p><i>Oops. Okay, so maybe I hit it a little tooooooo hard. </i>She shook her head 
and sighed. Perhaps Minako was starting to rub off on her. The woman was always pulling 
stupid stunts like this.</p><p><i>Anyway, I guess I’ve really gone and done it. If Minako 
was asleep then she sure isn’t going to be now… that infernal noise was loud enough to wake 
anyone within ten corridors of here! </i></p><p>Feeling that her cover was already blown, 
Rei waltzed into the room a few steps and bellowed,</p><p>“Minako! Are you awake?”</p><p>Rei 
hushed her own breathing and listened for some verbal response. When none came she suddenly 
realized something about the environment that struck her odd. Perhaps the force of the 
slamming door threw her hearing off but she seriously doubted it. The chamber was quiet, too 
quiet. It felt unnatural but what was missing?</p><p>In front of her the pool water was 
swirling gently, reflecting the artificial starlight from the ceiling above. Only a slight 
watery noise was emitted from it. <i>Nothing wrong there. </i>Rei affirmed. Her eyes swooped 
over the potted plants around the perimeter of the body of water. Still leaves. It meant 
that there was no wind; the windows must be closed. And the lighting of the room, why was it 
so dark? Rei had to squint to see to the far left of the pool in the bedroom’s general 
direction to even make out the smaller doorway.</p><p>“Minako?” She called out again. Rei’s 
drowsiness had slipped away long ago and her soldier’s instincts were on the alert. However 
she could feel herself pushing past her physical limit again.</p><p><i>Something’s wrong 
here… Why isn’t Minako responding?</i></p><p>Allowing herself to venture further into the 
room, Rei slowly made her way towards the bedchamber. One-step, two steps, she paused when 
she thought she had heard something shuffle in the shadows. When there was silence again she 
crept forward a little more. Every movement that her stiff muscles made was acutely detected 
by her senses. The small reflexive twitches of overworked limbs, how heavy and numb they 
felt; it was difficult to hear any sounds above the thumping of her racing heart. She forced 
her breathing to slow to a still. Was she afraid? Like any other person, Rei was vulnerable 
without her armor (perhaps not completely helpless, but there was a considerable 
difference).</p><p><i><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></i></p><p><i><b>Shuffle.</b></i></p><p>Rei froze. 
<i>There it is again! </i>The raven-haired woman waited for the noise to reoccur. Rei’s eyes 
darted to either side of the room before she tip-toed at an angle to her left, bringing her 
closer, yet keeping her a good distance from the doorway. Not knowing her opponent’s range 
she was determined on keep at a reasonable distance.</p><p><i><b>Shuffle.</b></i></p><p>With 
one arm up for defence and the other drawn back in a strike position Rei cried out, “Who’s 
there? For the last time, Minako is that you? Grr…Whoever you are, you better show yourself 
now! If you’ve done anything to the girl--!!”</p><p>“You’ll do what?” Rei heard a voice and 
felt a warm breath tickle her ear. “I’m right here... Rei, bear.” Before she could react, 
Rei felt a pair of arms clamp around her and drew her into a tight embrace.</p><p>“Minako!” 
Rei instantly protested, but Minako merely giggled and tightened her hold around her 
prisoner. She could feel Rei’s weak attempts to struggle and it brought another happy smile 
to her face.</p><p>“Aww, you’re really soft without all that armor,” Minako giggled as she 
nuzzled against Rei’s neck.</p><p>One of her hands came to rest beneath the thin shirt the 
other woman wore and gently tickled the smooth skin that she found at Rei’s waist. The other 
continued to hold the raven-haired warrior in her grasp. Rei squirmed at the unaccustomed 
sensation, trying to break free only to find that she couldn’t. Not having to push herself 
so hard since her younger days, she knew that her body was shutting down in preparation for 
the deep sleep that would be sure to follow. Soon she would have to rely on the blonde 
entirely for balance and support, and it disturbed her. Especially with the way Minako was 
behaving now!</p><p>“Minako, let me go right now!”</p><p>But Minako’s ignored Rei’s awkward 
movements and curiously continued her exploration. She could hardly believe how soft Rei’s 
skin was. <i>For a soldier, I thought it would be… really rough?</i> She guessed. Her 
fingers lightly trailed over the hard stomach and Rei sucked in breath. <i>Oh, I found some 
more strong muscles. </i></p><p>In the dark Rei’s face burned bright crimson. Being caught 
was the last thing she would’ve expected and the physical contact was making her skin crawl. 
All she knew was that she wanted out and NOW.</p><p>“Let go!” She was becoming frantic. She 
had to get out of here. <i>Any enemy battle is better than this!</i></p><p>“Mm… no.” Minako 
drawled as she allowed her chin to rest on Rei’s shoulder. Rei flinched. Why did Minako have 
to breathe on her neck? Why did it have to feel so warm?</p><p>“Why would I want to? You’re 
so warm and comfy… better than any teddy bear.”</p><p>“That’s nice. Now let go.” Rei’s legs 
trembled. <i>Oh damn it…</i></p><p>“… !” <i>Wha--?</i></p><p>Finally after all the abuse 
they had taken, Rei’s legs buckled from underneath 
her…</p><p>“AH!”</p><p><b>THUD!</b></p><p>Leaving her in a very uncompromising 
situation…</p><p>However, Minako wasn’t about to complain. When the blonde woman glanced 
down, she saw herself straddling Rei, pinning her to the floor as a result of their fall. 
The sight of the proud woman, with her gorgeous dark hair spraying out beneath them, the 
defiant look in her eyes, and especially how Rei wasn’t lifting a finger to change their 
position-- it all added up.</p><p>“You can’t move can you?” Minako grinned. “I warned you 
that you were overdoing it, but did you listen?” Her cerulean eyes twinkled at the 
possibilities. Oh, there were so many.</p><p><i>I could have my way with her, have my way 
with her or have my way with her. Decisions, decisions, decisions… but… this isn’t the way 
it’s supposed to go right? Isn’t she supposed to be the one coming onto me? Hmm… I must have 
miscalculated. Oh well! Beggars can’t be choosers! For the sake of the mission! 
</i></p><p>But although Minako rallied her courage in the name of the mission, she couldn’t 
repress the happiness she got from the thought of being with Rei. She felt a personal joy 
that felt detached from the sense of duty.</p><p><i>She’s so pretty, and strong and 
INCREDIBLY stubborn! But I don’t think she’s cruel… even though she hit me back on the 
battlefield, it was like she was someone entirely different once the battle ended. She 
protected Hotaru, and she gave Nozomi a home. On top of that, even though she doesn’t like 
me...she offered to stay here with me tonight. I don’t quite understand 
her.</i></p><p>Unconsciously Minako’s hands were about to reach down and unbutton Rei’s 
shirt when the fiery woman snapped,</p><p>“So what? I might have overdone things a bit but 
I’m perfectly fine.”</p><p>Minako stopped. <i>Oh, here we go again. She always has to argue 
with me doesn’t she? </i>But the Venusian couldn’t resist letting this stretch out a little 
longer; as they say, longing makes the heart grow fonder, or something cheesy that 
like.</p><p>“So what?” The blonde repeated with an amused look. “Say what you want Rei-bear, 
but it means that you’re helpless. Helpless like a newborn babe,” She tapped her noise and 
elicited a growl from her hostage.</p><p>“DON’T SAY THAT!”</p><p>“What? Helpless?” After 
being ignored all day, this was a pleasant change. “Helpless! Helpless! 
Heeeeelpless.”</p><p>“CuT…tHaT…oUt. Just what are you planning anyway?”</p><p>“...Are you 
really that dense Rei?” Rei threw another glare. The unexpected reaction sent Minako 
spiralling deep into thought. She didn’t know whether Rei was really ignorant or if she was 
just playing around. Okay, she’d bite.</p><p>“Seriously, Rei...?” Minako repeated in a light 
hearted voice.</p><p>“Minako, what in the name of Mars are you going on about? You’re heavy, 
get off.” Rei’s voice trailed off. The drowsiness she felt was beginning to 
build.</p><p>Minako leaned forward and propped herself up on her elbows to either side of 
Rei’s face and looked her companion in the eye. However Rei was momentarily distracted by 
the hand that cupped her cheek; the action felt foreign to her. Thus she wasn’t prepared 
when the blonde suddenly asked in a very serious voice, “I’m asking you... have you ever 
been in a relationship? I want you to look at me straight in the eye and give me an honest 
answer.”</p><p>Partially shocked, Rei opened her mouth and then closed it, ending the action 
with a frown.</p><p><i>Should I say something or not? Yes, no, yes, no, oh hell, I’m just 
tired! </i>She was also quite sure that Minako would do something evil if she didn’t give 
her an answer. And never being one to lie, Rei truthfully said,</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Never 
held hands, went on romantic walks or even a date?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Minako did a double 
take on the seriousness that she saw in those amethyst eyes. She just stared, and stared, 
but the truth that they held wouldn’t change.</p><p>“And you’re how 
old?”</p><p>“Minako!”</p><p>“Okay, okay…” Minako relented and leaned back to give Rei some 
space. She could see that she was embarrassing the other woman enough.</p><p><i>But if she’s 
never been in a relationship before or has done anything of the sort then there’s no point 
in asking if she’s ever made love to a person. It’s strange. I didn’t expect this… 
</i></p><p>Minako’s resolve began to wane. “Just one more question. It’s the last one like 
this, I promise. I’m wondering, have you… ever loved anyone before Rei? Like, more than a 
family member or a friend?”</p><p>“I told you, no.” Rei said stiffly. Her eyes were half 
lidded now and her gaze was becoming increasingly unfocused.</p><p>The answer puzzled the 
Venusian.</p><p><i>I have you right where I want you. You’re here, beneath me and helpless. 
</i>Minako trailed her fingers over Rei’s delicate cheek again, but this time Rei didn’t 
flinch away. <i>How can you go through life and never have loved? What have you been doing 
this entire time? Were you lonely...? Doesn’t it hurt?<br></i><br>With closed eyes Rei could 
sense Minako’s discomfort and, inwardly, she sighed. She never thought she would tell this 
woman anything about herself, or particularly, this sort of information. It wasn’t something 
she normally wanted to chat about, even to Ares. Perhaps it was a strange act of fate? Fate, 
personal choice, drowsiness, anyhow, she relented to a certain degree.</p><p>“I doubt you 
can understand this Minako, but this isn’t Venus. I told you once before. The only thing 
that matters on Mars is strength. Since childhood I’ve been training to take over as this 
planet’s leader. That’s all I needed to do, so I did it.”</p><p><i>I knew since the day that 
Ares took me in...If I wanted to outdo him, I would have to devote my entire life to getting 
stronger. For that reason, I was confined for five years in the training center. All I did 
was train. Only after that did Ares allow me to walk about the palace freely, but even then, 
that was restricted.</i></p><p><i>My responsibilities...? My future...?</i></p><p>“I simply 
don’t have time for silly things such as love. That should answer all of your questions 
about my love life, shouldn’t it? It’s stupid anyway, people toying with another person’s 
feelings unnecessarily...”</p><p>Minako felt a stab of pain and guilt. But she also felt 
something else tug at her heart …</p><p><i>I do understand. More than you think… 
</i></p><p>“So, are you going to tell me what you’re doing now?” Rei asked in an exasperated 
voice.</p><p>“It’s nothing Rei.” With that, Minako stood up. Rei could feel the heavy weight 
lift from her body. “I was only doing an examination; it’s a tradition that a diplomat of 
Venus conducts a physical examination of the hosting planet’s leader. You know, since a 
leader reflects their planet and all that jazz. And guess what? You passed! Aren’t you 
happy?” Minako gave a wide grin even though Rei couldn’t see it.</p><p>“Oh, yay…” Rei’s 
words trailed off.</p><p>Minako cocked her head to the side in a curious manner. She had 
expected Rei to explode with rage after being treated like a test subject without 
permission.</p><p>“Rei?” Minako bent down and poked the woman only to get no response. She 
continued to jab her a few more times in the ribs while thinking,</p><p><i>What does she 
have to worry about anyway? I mean, I was going to seduce her for Goddess sake! I say she 
got off easy.</i></p><p><i><b>Poke, poke, 
poke…</b></i></p><p>“...Rei?”</p><p>“…ZzZzZz…”</p><p>“She’s asleep! How ‘bout that?” Minako 
looked right and then left to make sure they were really alone. When she was satisfied she 
giggled at the sleeping figure. “Yeah… you got real lucky Rei-bear, but you’ll never know 
it.”</p><p>Warmly, Minako continued to gaze at her new friend.</p><p><i>I really shouldn’t 
be doing this, but... for now I think the mission can be put on hold. Don’t get me wrong, 
I’m just feeling merciful, that’s all. I can seduce her whenever I want! It’s just...I’m 
curious. I have a feeling that there’s a lot I could learn about her yet, and that’s my job 
isn’t it? I mean, being a ‘diplomat’ and all...</i></p><p>Noticing that something was amiss, 
Minako momentarily disappeared into the bedchamber and returned to where Rei slept with 
pillows and a blanket in hand. Carefully she draped the large quilt over Rei. Her teddy-bear 
flinched at the contact at first but she quickly relaxed and unconsciously snuggled up into 
the soft material. She accepted the pillow without any protest.</p><p>“Mm… 
ZzZzZz…”</p><p><i>Secretly, I wish I could be a little more like her... And maybe, just 
maybe…</i></p><p>Minako laid down beside Rei and her finger’s soon found their way to the 
Martian’s soft lips. For a moment they danced around the scarlet red while the blonde 
watched with a thoughtful gaze. She then bent down, blushing…</p><p>“Real lucky. Night 
Rei...” And kissed Rei’s cheek.</p><p>“…ZzZz…”</p>
