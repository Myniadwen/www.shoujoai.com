<h1>Unchained Melody (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hwingwhit.html">Heath Wingwhit</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Rei grips the broom handle tighter when she spots Minako ascending the 
stairs to the shrine. She sweeps for some moments longer, not wanting 
Mina to think that all business gets put aside just because she happens 
to be visiting. Rei is unaware of how her eyes keep darting to the 
figure climbing the steps, almost as if she can&#39;t believe that the 
irritating pop star and oft times tormenter is really back.

&quot;The magazines would like a picture of Mars Reiko-san like this,&quot; Minako 
tells her as she reaches the top step and indicates the broom with a nod 
of her head.

Rei is nearly self-conscious at the mention of any magazines. To hear 
that old name mentioned again stirs memories. Rei tries to hide her 
annoyance. &quot;Don&#39;t call me that,&quot; she brushes a collection of leaves past 
Mina&#39;s boots and sets the broom to the side. &quot;Anyway, what are you doing 
here?&quot;

&quot;I came to visit my number one fan-&quot;

&quot;Ridiculous-&quot;

&quot;And bring you a signed c.d.&quot; Mina reaches into her bag and extends the 
compact disc to Rei who looks at the present as if she&#39;s being offered 
poison. &quot;You can take it, I won&#39;t tell the others.&quot;

She extends a hand and manages to keep from ripping it away from Minako. 
&quot;Some of the kids who visit the temple might like it,&quot; she explains.

&quot;Keep it for the kids,&quot; Mina smiles sarcastically and looks around. 
&quot;When will you cut your own album?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t intend to.&quot;

&quot;The sales wouldn&#39;t be as good,&quot; she concedes.

Rei glares and is tempted to correct her before realizing it might be 
what Mina wants. &quot;Is this the reason you came?&quot;

A nod. &quot;I could stay longer if you like.&quot;

She feels as if she&#39;s been tricked somehow. &quot;You&#39;re busy, I&#39;m sure.&quot;

&quot;I could make a little time. Anyway, I&#39;m bored.&quot;

There&#39;s a long pause, and Rei speaks as if this is a nuisance. &quot;Fine.&quot;

They walk around the temple for a while because Rei does not know how to 
invite her in. Mina asks if the shrine is hard to maintain to which Rei 
answers no, as long as you keep up with it. In time, Rei comes to 
realize that she is having difficulty not staring at Mina. Up until this 
point they have spent time together but only in a group. Minako is busy 
being a celebrity and Rei still grapples with the effect Minako&#39;s death 
had on her.

It has weighed on her mind, and it still does, the issue of if Minako is 
now healthy and well. They sit on the wooden floor at the front of the 
temple and Rei is not unconscious of the sounds of humming birds and 
leaves stirring on trees.

&quot;It feels peaceful and calm here,&quot; Minako says as she stares into the 
distance. &quot;I don&#39;t know if this is the kind of place I would have 
pictured you in.&quot;

&quot;How is your health?&quot; Rei can&#39;t help being blunt and she dismisses 
Mina&#39;s comment. She figures Minako&#39;s health and the knowledge of it goes 
before her pride.

&quot;My health?&quot; Minako turns to look at her, a tinge of a smile on her 
lips. &quot;It&#39;s fine.&quot;

Rei frowns, undeterred. &quot;You said that last time, too.&quot;

&quot;Are you worried?&quot;

Minako&#39;s flippant tone provokes a scowl from Rei. &quot;It&#39;s nothing to joke 
about!&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s joking?&quot; She looks at her for a long time.

&quot;Why can&#39;t you give a straight answer?&quot; It bothers her that Mina can 
make jokes about it. She wonders if Minako is falling back on old 
patterns in which her health was of little concern to her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry I bothered you before,&quot; she says.

&quot;Bothered?&quot; Rei&#39;s voice comes close to cracking. She wonders if she 
imagined the splintering in it and hopes that Minako didn&#39;t make it out.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Her voice is calm and almost completely devoid of any sort of 
emotion. She sounds like the cold leader she tried to portray herself as 
in the past. &quot;I never meant to upset you. We always knew I might die. I 
didn&#39;t want to form attachments. I knew it&#39;d be easier that way.&quot;

The shrine priestess is speechless and tries to make sense of the 
riddles that Minako frequently speaks in. Her fingers curl in tight 
balls and she holds them to her knees. The question arises as to whether 
there is any use in trying to keep her expression neutral. It&#39;s soon 
resolved without further thought because she can&#39;t.

&quot;If you hadn&#39;t followed me around,&quot; Mina goes on to say, &quot;it wouldn&#39;t 
have been a problem.&quot;

Rei faces her sharply, indignation and anger burning in her eyes. Mina 
leans forward to connect their lips. Rei feels her mind go blank and her 
eyes widen, a completely new emotion taking hold of her than from just 
two seconds ago. Minako&#39;s lips, Rei acknowledges somewhere in the depths 
of her mind, are not only smooth but they taste like cherries. She yanks 
away from Minako because she can&#39;t not do it.

The two stare for some moments. Minako looks not much too different from 
normal.

&quot;What-?&quot; Was that, she means to ask. Rei can&#39;t get a hold of her tongue, 
or her words. Her lips burn. How like Minako to do something like this 
just to throw her. There&#39;s the soft fragrance of vanilla on Minako, but 
Rei tells herself it isn&#39;t important. &quot;Do you think you can change the 
subject like that?&quot;

&quot;I thought I was addressing it.&quot; Her hand is touching her cheek before 
Rei can realize any better. &quot;Are you blushing?&quot;

She is. &quot;Don&#39;t be stupid!&quot; Minako&#39;s pointing out of the fact seems to 
make her face burn brighter. Either way, she doesn&#39;t know what Minako is 
talking about. How can kissing her be addressing any subject having to 
do with her health? Why does she have to smile like that? She likes to 
torture her, Rei is sure of it. &quot;Why did you do that?&quot;

&quot;You didn&#39;t want me to?&quot; Mina&#39;s hand drops from her face though she is 
still close. &quot;To answer your question, I&#39;m well. You don&#39;t have to 
worry.&quot;

Rei tries to stay angry but can&#39;t. She&#39;s relieved and her smile shows 
it.

&quot;So you do smile.&quot; Her smile is mocking and her tone is light. &quot;Either 
you&#39;re relieved about my well-being or I&#39;m a good kisser.&quot; Rei frowns 
and Minako stands. &quot;Anyway, I have an appointment to make and I can&#39;t 
stay.&quot;

Rei looks up at her but is incapable of saying anything.

&quot;Maybe you can visit me next time. Now that there aren&#39;t hospitals 
involved, I won&#39;t have to see you look so grumpy.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re going to be late if you keep talking,&quot; Rei fumbles because she 
doesn&#39;t know how to be nice right now. Minako smiles at her, as if she&#39;s 
on to her game and moves away as if without a care in the world. Rei 
can&#39;t help her fingers touching to her lips.
