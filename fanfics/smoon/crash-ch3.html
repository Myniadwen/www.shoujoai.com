Part 3! Aren&#39;t you EXCITED?

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Sitting at the shrine later that evening, Ami turned from the group of 
girls to look at Makoto, who noticed the look and excused them. Rei, 
Minako, herself and Ami had all gone back to the shrine for the night 
(after much scolding by the staff of the hospital to get out of the 
waiting room), and Mamoru, Usagi and Haruka had stayed at the hospital 
in case something happened. Now Makoto felt her hand being enclosed by 
Ami&#39;s, the shorter girl immediately intertwining their fingers. For 
whatever reason, Ami was always very affectionate, and tonight was 
little to no exception. She led them to the outside of the shrine, 
sitting on the stairs and looking out onto the town. &quot;Mako-chan, what 
you did for Haruka-san tonight was absolutely splendid,&quot; commented 
Ami, making it clear that this was what she had brought Makoto out to 
talk about. 

&quot;It was nothing, really. I just told her what she needed to hear,&quot; 
explained the taller girl. 

Ami tapped her lightly on the nose. &quot;Exactly! You have a real talent 
with people, Mako-chan. You saw Haruka-san break down and immediately 
knew what she needed to be told. You looked her directly in the eye 
and told her we loved her. That was what she needed to hear,&quot; she 
finished. 

Blushing lightly, she decided to lighten the serious atmosphere by 
making somewhat of a joke. She looked Ami in the eye and said, &quot;I love 
you, Ami.&quot; Successfully making the shorter girl blush, she laughed. 
&quot;See? All I ever do is look people in the eye and say I love them.&quot; 

The young doctor looked somewhat miffed. &quot;Mako-chan, that&#39;s not what I 
meant and you know it,&quot; she scolded. 

&quot;I know, but I meant it. I love you very much, Ami.&quot; She leaned 
foreword and kissed her, suddenly sullen again. &quot;If anything happened 
to you, I don&#39;t know what I would do with myself. That&#39;s why I knew 
what Haruka-san needed to hear. It&#39;s what I would need to hear. But I 
don&#39;t think it would even comfort me that much. I&#39;m not convinced that 
the poor girl feels any better after hearing it.&quot; 

A frown formed on Ami&#39;s face. &quot;It&#39;s true. She must be in shambles, 
Mako-chan. In pieces. She&#39;s so strong not to show it for as long as 
she did.&quot; A pause, and then, &quot;But foolish, too. She needs to have some 
of that weight lifted or she&#39;ll fall apart.&quot; 

Makoto smiled sadly at her, then. &quot;But Michiru is the one who usually 
lifts that weight from her.&quot; 

Sighing in a mixture of sadness and defeat, the shorter leaned 
foreword and slumped against her lover, feeling her body give way to 
weariness. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

&quot;I think we should tell the others,&quot; stated Minako bravely as Rei made 
up a bed in the guest room. She was leaning on the side of the 
doorframe, arms crossed over her stomach, watching the raven-haired 
girl work. &quot;It&#39;s been almost three months and there&#39;s really no need 
for--&quot; 

&quot;I agree.&quot; 

&quot;--All this secrecy.&quot; The blonde&#39;s eyes suddenly widened. &quot;What?&quot; 

&quot;I agree, Mina-chan. I think they deserve to know. Besides, I feel so 
sinister about the whole thing. Especially now, when I know you are 
sad but I can&#39;t put my arms around you.&quot; Rei finished setting up the 
bed and walked up to Minako, placing her hands on the blonde&#39;s 
forearms. She could feel the muscles just under the skin. &quot;Ami-chan 
and Mako-chan will only need one bed, right?&quot; 

A laugh sounded from the blonde, and Rei smiled at the sound. It was 
like music. Like wind rustling the trees. &quot;Probably. Just like us, 
ne?&quot; 

Rei nodded. &quot;Of course. I plan on holding you close tonight, 
Mina-chan.&quot; As Minako smiled at her, Rei moved one of her hands up to 
touch the other girl&#39;s cheek. &quot;Mina-chan, you mean so much to me. You 
know that?&quot; 

&quot;I know,&quot; she replied, knowing that the remarks were deeply rooted in 
sorrow. As she tried not to imagine what it might be like to lose Rei 
for the umpteenth time that day, she felt another rush of respect for 
Haruka. &quot;I bet Haruka-san already suspects about us,&quot; she chuckled. 

Trying to fend off the shadows that threatened to overtake their 
moods, the miko joked, &quot;Yeah, I bet she knew before we did. Hell, she 
knew about Ami-chan and Mako-chan.&quot; 

&quot;What about us?&quot; inquired a voice from down the hall. The two girls 
jumped away from each other, turning to meet their friends outside the 
room. 

&quot;We were talking about how Haruka-san and Michiru-san knew you two 
were having a relationship before you told them,&quot; laughed Minako. At 
this point, it seemed foolish to lie about such a thing. 

Ami and Makoto, who of course already knew about Rei and Minako but 
hadn&#39;t let on they knew, just blushed lightly at the memory and 
chuckled. After an awkward silence, Ami yawned loudly and Makoto told 
her friends firmly that the two of them were going to bed. 

&quot;Okay, we&#39;ll wake you up to get ready to go to the hospital at six.&quot; 
Visiting hours, Ami had informed them, were 7 A.M. to 9 P.M. But 
family could stay through the night. Rei was in charge of waking up 
her friends, since there was no clock in the guest room and Minako had 
magnets in her fingers that drew her to the &quot;Sleep&quot; button. &quot;Good 
night, Ami-chan, Mako-chan.&quot; Rei nodded at Minako, who waved to her 
friends and followed the raven-haired girl out of the room. 

&quot;They only gave us one bed,&quot; observed Makoto, watching Ami. Ami just 
shrugged and took off her over shirt. 

&quot;We would only use one anyway.&quot; 

Both fell asleep as soon as they were curled up into each other. 

Rei and Minako had a bit more difficulty. As soon as they had gotten 
to Rei&#39;s room, Minako had been overcome with grief and started to cry 
again. Rei, too, started to cry, and the two of them cried each other 
to sleep. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

Though she tried to hide it, Haruka was still in as bad of a state as 
she was before. It had progressed to the point that she simply refused 
to leave Michiru&#39;s side, and on two separate occasions Rei had walked 
into the room to find Haruka running her hands lightly through the 
sleeping girl&#39;s hair. Even after she cleared her throat to announce 
her presence, Haruka&#39;s hand only hesitated a moment before reluctantly 
pulling away. &quot;Haruka-san...&quot; started Rei. 

&quot;Gomen, I just feel like if I don&#39;t make an effort to reach out to 
her... She won&#39;t know I&#39;m here.&quot; After a second of silence, she 
laughed weakly. &quot;I must sound so foolish.&quot; 

Rei shook her head furiously and sat in the chair next to Haruka, 
placing a hand carefully on the other girl&#39;s shoulder. Somewhere in 
the back of her mind, she made a mental note to comment on the 
blonde&#39;s amazing biceps later. &quot;I&#39;m sure she knows you&#39;re here, 
Haruka-san. She always seems to know when you&#39;re around, and 
vice-versa.&quot; The miko searched her mind for an example. &quot;Remember the 
time when we were having a slumber party at Usagi-chan&#39;s house and you 
knew exactly when Michiru-san was walking up the driveway? I remember 
she was late because she had practice, and Yaten was driving her to 
the house, and you were very jealous.&quot; 

Slowly but surely, Haruka&#39;s lips twitched into somewhat of a sad 
smile. &quot;I wasn&#39;t jealous.&quot; 

The hand on her shoulder moved around to the other shoulder, enclosing 
the racer in a half-hug. &quot;Haruka-san, I have something to tell you and 
the other girls, and I thought you should be the first to know. 
Because I&#39;ve looked up to you from the moment I met you and thought 
you were a handsome boy.&quot; She stopped talking for a moment to chuckle 
and gather her courage. After a minute, she took a deep breath and 
said, carefully, &quot;Minako and I are in love, and we&#39;ve been dating for 
the past three months.&quot; 

&quot;I know. Michiru and I saw you at a club two months ago. We also 
suspected you would get together long before that.&quot; 

Rei looked at her in astonishment, then shook her head and let out 
something between a laugh and a snort. &quot;You two must have radar or 
something.&quot; 

&quot;We like to call it &#39;gay-dar&#39;.&quot; 

The miko would have laughed if not for the fact that the taller girl&#39;s 
green eyes were focused completely on her sleeping lover as they 
talked. &quot;Well, listen. Mina-chan and I were going to go pick up some 
breakfast from the restaurant downstairs. Do you want anything?&quot; 

All she recieved in reply was the shake of a head. 

&quot;Haruka-san, you have to eat some time,&quot; implored Rei. 

Shaking her head again, the girl in question said quietly, &quot;I don&#39;t 
think I could swallow anything right now, Rei-chan.&quot; 

Accepting this answer, Rei nodded, then stood and left the room, 
saying nothing else. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

Ever since she had woken up from her nap, Usagi had been acting very 
strangely. She had been acting even more ditzy than usual, actually 
forgetting to close the car door when she got out after their short 
outing to a luncheonette. Even at the diner she had acted oddly, 
deciding not to order anything and just sitting quietly, nursing a cup 
of black coffee. Just as Mamoru was finishing up his French toast, his 
little Bunny came clean. 

&quot;Queen Serenity visited me while I was sleeping.&quot; She watched as her 
Mamo-chan choked on his breakfast. 

&quot;What?!&quot; he gasped. 

&quot;She said that no matter how bad it got, I mustn&#39;t interfere. That if 
I got in the way of Fate, certain very important things wouldn&#39;t 
happen.&quot; Although she was clearly very sad about what this might 
imply, she seemed to be taking it quite well. 

&quot;Well, what do you think about it, Usako? Do you think it means that 
Michiru-san...?&quot; He never really finished his question. Usagi sighed 
softly. 

&quot;I dunno, Mamo-chan. She didn&#39;t seem particularly sad when we spoke. 
In fact she seemed almost... amused.&quot; The expression on her face 
dropped, replaced by one of mild anger. &quot;How could she laugh at such a 
situation? I know I can&#39;t feel bitterness towards her, but for some 
reason I&#39;m still annoyed by it all.&quot; 

Clearly, his girlfriend had been thinking about this very deeply. He 
reached across the table and took her hand. &quot;If Queen Serenity thinks 
that we shouldn&#39;t interfere, then we definitely should not interfere,&quot; 
he stated simply. 

After a hesitant, regretful pause, the girl sighed, &quot;I know.&quot; 

Much to Mamoru&#39;s joy, her spirits lifted after that, and she ordered 
an extra-large plate of pancakes. 

------------------------------------------------------------ 

Later, in the mid-afternoon, Hotaru and Setsuna arrived, looking 
absolutely liquid with weariness and worry. They entered the waiting 
room to lots of hugs from the Senshi. Trying not to intrude, they led 
the two women to the room where a sleeping Michiru and a distant 
Haruka waited quietly. The racer turned when her daughter and friend 
entered, standing to embrace them both warmly. Hotaru broke away to 
stand by her Michiru-mama, tears running silently down her face. 
Haruka led Setsuna out of the room to give the young girl some time 
alone. 

&quot;How are you holding up?&quot; asked Setsuna, brushing back the other 
girl&#39;s bangs. Though they did not share the same relationship as 
Haruka and Michiru, they still felt strong feelings toward each other 
and treated each other as something of a sisterly relationship. 

The lanky blonde let out a breath. &quot;I&#39;m fine now, thanks to the girls. 
They&#39;re so good with words, after a little reassuring from them I&#39;m 
able to keep myself from falling apart.&quot; Capturing the Senshi of Time 
in another bone-crushing hug, she whispered, &quot;But I suspect I&#39;ll be 
less lonely with you and Hotaru-chan here.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, Haruka, you know you&#39;re never alone. Everyone around you is more 
than willing to give you support,&quot; remarked Setsuna, carefully 
returning the embrace, letting her head rest on her friend&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;Of course I&#39;m hearing that now, but Michiru is my main support, 
Setsuna. Without her I feel lost, and subtract you from the equation 
and I&#39;m completely alone.&quot; 

&quot;...She&#39;s my main support too. I guess she&#39;s always drawn people to 
her with her mothering nature.&quot; Of course, that was a lie. Setsuna 
relied heavily on Hotaru for support, the two of them being the oldest 
Senshi. Sometimes when Setsuna was feeling bad about living on her 
own, without a lover, Sailor Saturn would make an appearance in the 
small body of her daughter, and the two of them would share their 
sorrows with each other during long talks. 

But of course, none of the other Senshi knew of any of this. 

&quot;I never wanted her to take care of me. I always wanted to protect 
her. But I failed, Setsuna. I failed miserably. Why did I let her go 
on her own? I could have just as easily gone and--&quot; 

Faster than Haruka could even have imagined her friend could move, 
Setsuna backed out of the embrace and slapped the racer across the 
face. 

Down the hall at her hiding spot, Ami gasped and clasped her hand over 
her mouth. 

&quot;Don&#39;t blame yourself for this, Haruka,&quot; admonished Setsuna. &quot;Do you 
think that Michiru would want you to feel like this was your fault? 
No! Of course not!&quot; She shook her head, long green hair swishing 
against her shoulders and back. &quot;You&#39;re more of a fool than I can 
believe, Haruka.&quot; 

Hotaru stepped out of the room, and Setsuna brushed past her, pausing 
momentarily to place a hand on the shorter girl&#39;s shoulder and look 
her in the eye. The young girl nodded, then walked out to confront her 
Haruka-papa while Setsuna visited her friend. 

Barely making eye contact with her daughter, Haruka mumbled, &quot;She&#39;s 
got a mean right hook.&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;ve got a meaner one, Haruka-papa. If I catch you feeling guilty 
again, I&#39;ll have to demonstrate.&quot; She shook her fist in front of her 
papa&#39;s face. 

Feeling that this conversation would no longer serve a purpose, Ami 
walked out from behind the corner and approached the two women. 
&quot;Haruka-san, the doctors want to see you,&quot; she informed her. 

&quot;Thanks, Ami-chan.&quot; The blond shoved her hands into her pockets and 
walked off, cheek stinging and head spinning.</pre>
