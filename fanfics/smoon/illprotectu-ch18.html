<h1>I'll Protect You (part 18 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>The concert lasted for two and a half hours and the plan of changing 
Minako&#39;s wardrobes twelve times worked. Even the make up and the stage 
switch, everything in plan worked, including Minako&#39;s speech for her 
fans, friends, parents, the concert staff and others that she 
acknowledged

Up until the end of the concert the police maintain their high security 
level. Minako, before leaving the theatre, entertained some reporters 
and fans who won backstage passes. After that Minako&#39;s staff started to 
pack their stuff and made their way to the backstage exit where a van is 
waiting to take them back at the hotel

Minutes later Rei rejoined the other bodyguards in Minako&#39;s dressing 
room. The pop star now wears a glitter blue dress robe with bonnet-like 
hat for her loose blonde hair and boots that matched her blue eyes

&quot;Rei-chan, can I speak to you privately?&quot; Minako asked as she grabs Rei 
to the restroom. She immediately closed the door so that the two other 
bodyguards won&#39;t be able to follow

&quot;Stay there, this won&#39;t take long&quot; Minako called to them then she turned 
to Rei

&quot;You did best out there&quot; Rei whispered

&quot;Hmph, best only?&quot; Minako pouted

Rei smiled and then she kissed Minako from forehead to nose and finally 
the pop star&#39;s pinkish lips

&quot;Heheh...silly, is that better than &#39;best&#39; now?&quot; Rei said

&quot;Thanks for your support out there&quot;

&quot;I want you to see me. I&#39;m glad we get to talk now&quot;

&quot;Oh yes, about that...Have you decided? The flight&#39;s tomorrow morning&quot; 
Minako asked

&quot;You don&#39;t have to ask that because I&#39;ll go with you. I&#39;ll just...finish 
things up before we go&quot;

&quot;Right. While you fix things up I&#39;ll invite mom and dad at the hotel so 
that I can have a formal goodbye&quot;

&quot;Better do that. Let&#39;s go, we&#39;ll talk about the rest of this when you 
get back at the hotel. You still have visitors waiting for you at the 
hotel. You&#39;ll get tired if you stayed here longer&quot; Rei said

&quot;Oh, it&#39;s such a waste that I wasn&#39;t able to go at Shibuya, or at Bunkyo 
to visit Tokyo University, or see the Imperial Palace once again!&quot;

&quot;What? You just thought of visiting places when you&#39;re about to leave?&quot; 
Rei whispered in disbelief

&quot;I&#39;m just kidding! Besides, I&#39;ll go back here immediately after I finish 
three concerts in Europe. Okay let&#39;s go! I can&#39;t wait to-&quot;

-BOOM! (er...I know it sounds/looks boring but this is how I express 
explosions, gomen! . )

An explosion sounded from inside the theatre. Minako and Rei both jumped 
at the sound. Rei hugged Minako for protection

&quot;Rei-chan, what&#39;s going on out there?&quot; Minako asked worriedly

&quot;I don&#39;t know. Something just exploded!&quot; Rei opened the doorknob of the 
restroom

&#39;Could it be Sanctuary? But they promised they won&#39;t do anything!&#39;

The two other agents waiting are now multiplied into five and they all 
surrounded Rei and the pop star. They started to lead the way out of the 
dressing room

&quot;Where are Minako&#39;s staff?&quot; Asked Rei to the police officer as she ties 
her long black hair into a pony tail (AN: This is a habit of Rei-chan 
every time she becomes a LOT serious. Only occurs when her hair&#39;s 
loosen)

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about them. They are taken immediately back at the hotel. 
The other police are now determining the cause of the explosion&quot; Replied 
the police officer

&quot;We must escort Aino-san immediately&quot; Another police officer talked

The police surrounding Minako and Rei all had their guns drawn. Rei 
instantly withdrew her gun when gunshots were heard not so far away from 
them

&quot;Extra careful, men! Remember that our top priority is to escort 
Aino-san back at the hotel safe and sound&quot; The police officer said as 
they all hurried to the practice hall. Rei held Minako close to her and 
held the pop star&#39;s shaking hand tight

&quot;Sir, the gunshots are coming from outside the backstage! We must think 
of alternative passage!&quot;

&quot;How about the fire exits?&quot; Rei suggested

&quot;We can&#39;t go to the fire exit, I heard gunshots there too. I bet they 
had all fire exits cornered too&quot; replied the police on their back

&quot;Look, it&#39;s the head chief of TNPH!&quot; said another police as he pointed 
to the direction in their right

They saw the head chief and his men waving their hands signaling them to 
go to their direction. Rei and the others immediately approached them

&quot;I can&#39;t believe Sanctuary attacked us after the security&#39;s leveled down 
a bit, I expected them to attack in the middle of the concert!&quot; The head 
chief said to the police officer who was with Minako and Rei

&quot;Sanctuary you say? These guys have guns and they&#39;ve multiplied! What is 
the situation in the main entrance?&quot; Asked the police officer

&quot;We can&#39;t go to the entrance, the audience who were about to exit 
panicked and they&#39;re causing stampede. The safest way for Aino-san is 
the employee&#39;s entrance so let&#39;s go!&quot; Replied the head chief

&quot;B-big boss, is anybody hurt?&quot; Minako spoke for the first time after 
their run

The head chief thought for a moment whether he would tell Minako or not 
while they are all running to the employee&#39;s entrance

&quot;...Many...but most of them are police&quot;

&quot;What about my parents, Wendy and my friends?&quot; Asked the pop star

&quot;They&#39;re safe with your staff at the hotel. They&#39;re the ones who are 
very worried about you I bet, Aino-san&quot; Replied the head chief

--

Meanwhile at the other side of the theatre are a group of police 
exchanging gunshots with the armed men wearing camouflage vests and 
pants, their faces masked and only their eyes and mouth are exposed

&quot;Five of you help the other police assist the civilians to safety! Tell 
them we have this place covered and we can handle this! We won&#39;t know 
whether where or if there is another explosion next&quot; Ordered an officer 
to his men

&quot;Roger sir!&quot; Five police in his left responded then they both 
defensively marched out to avoid being hit by bullets

After the two police left moments later the gunfire coming from the 
enemy side instantly seized. The police were surprised

&quot;What happened? Did they flee?&quot;

&quot;Maybe it&#39;s a trap&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll take a look sir!&quot;

The police who volunteered run stealthily towards the seats where the 
armed men were firing seconds ago. He turned hastily and aimed his gun 
at where the armed men were supposed to be hiding. He stared at it for a 
moment before he speak

&quot;S-sir...I think they&#39;re dead&quot; Said the police who volunteered

&quot;What? H-how did that-they&#39;re firing at us awhile ago&quot; Said the officer 
in charge as they all approach to look. Fifteen masked men were lying 
unconsciously on the floor. The officer took one of the armed men&#39;s 
pulse

&quot;Well sir?&quot;

&quot;...I can&#39;t believe this...this one&#39;s dead!&quot;

&quot;This one too, sir!&quot; Called the police at their back

&quot;But I don&#39;t see any gunshots or blood...except for the other ones we 
shot down&quot;

&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter! We must help the others. Eight of you will remain 
here to take these bodies to the corner. Let&#39;s move and be careful!&quot; The 
officer commanded his men and they all moved to action

--

-Not far away from the group of police-

&quot;That took care of them. There are still many at the back&quot; Said the 
hazel haired Edward as he plays with his feather

&quot;Who the hell are those masked idiots? They&#39;ve ruined our plan!&quot; Hissed 
Henry

&quot;I bet Rei-san will blame us for this&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the problem! We haven&#39;t done anything yet except knocking the 
asses of those losers!&quot; Said the blonde man gruffly

&quot;What&#39;s done is done Henry. All we can do now is continue with the plan 
and help Ms. Aino go back safely at the hotel so that we can calm 
Rei-san down and tell her it wasn&#39;t us who did all these attacks&quot; 
Explained Edward

A skinny brown-haired man with a clef chin appeared silently behind them

&quot;Edward is right. We promised Hino-chan Ms. Aino&#39;s safety in the 
process. I asked Grey to watch Hino-chan and the pop star&#39;s back. 
They&#39;re heading to the employee&#39;s entrance. Leonard&#39;s taking care of the 
stupid guys who are messing with our plan. We have to follow Grey. But 
first we have to stop the other police to go to the employee&#39;s entrance 
because they will stand in the way. I feel something bad will 
happen...bad indeed&quot; Said Mark, his silver pendant with a winged lion 
and a sword stabbed in its wings engraved glittering in his chest

&quot;Yes, I agree with you. These guys here were just pawns to distract the 
police so that their other companions can silently sneak to the only 
choice left for the police to escape the pop star&quot; Said Henry

&quot;Yes. The Employee&#39;s Entrance&quot;

--

-Back at the hallway, path to the employee&#39;s entrance-

&quot;Sir, I don&#39;t think I&#39;m confident in the employee&#39;s entrance&quot; Rei 
commented the Police officer who ignored her and nodded at the head 
chief who also nodded back

&quot;Alert everyone! You, check the area to the right and then lead the 
way!&quot; Commanded the head chief to one of his men

&quot;At once, sir!&quot; The police whom the head chief appointed to advanced to 
them and checked the hall to the right. It was empty but suspiciously 
silent. The police appointed turned his head to them then spoke

&quot;Sir, the area is--argh!&quot;

The police was hit all over his body with the rain of bullets. The path 
way is a trap, everything is a trap

&quot;Damn! Surround Aino-san!&quot; The police officer yelled. The armed men 
fiercely firing their rifle in the front of the other police who had 
unluckily been shot because they were surrounded and they became a human 
shield

&quot;These men are planning to commit suicide just to kill all of us!&quot;

&quot;Head chief, sir! We can&#39;t go back to our previous position. Our men are 
going down one by one fast! We have no choice but to go straight ahead 
and exit the door at the end!&quot; The police officer said as he fire his 
gun

&quot;Then we go straight!&quot; Rei yelled, she is still hugging the trembling 
pop star

The head chief looked at his niece and then turned to the police officer

&quot;Go on head chief sir, we&#39;ll cover you!&quot; Said the police officer as he 
waves his hand to the two female bodyguards and both nodded. The police 
officer and the other police remained gathered their courage then ran 
straight to where the armed men are. The head chief, Rei, Minako, two 
policemen and Minako&#39;s bodyguards went straight to the employee&#39;s 
entrance. They were followed by about fifteen armed men

&quot;Sir, we&#39;ll handle those who were following us&quot; Said the police who is 
with them

&quot;Be careful&quot; The head chief called as they parted

Rei looked at the head chief with disbelief. &#39;What is he thinking? There 
could be other of those guys outside!&#39;

&quot;I do not doubt your decisions sir but I think we needed back up for-&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s too late for that agent Toshihike, besides, it will take them 
forever to come here. There will be more of those terrorists that will 
come to stop them in their way&quot; The head chief interrupted

&quot;Then you should have not agreed to let those two agents handle those 
guys back there! Haven&#39;t you noticed they weren&#39;t trying hard to catch 
up or fire their guns because there are others like them waiting for us 
out there, SIR?&quot; Yelled Rei heatedly

She was taken aback a little when the head chief gave her a cold stare 
but she ignored it instantly

&quot;There are agents and police waiting outside the employee&#39;s entrance, 
Hino. So I think you should not worry much&quot; He replied calmly

They all remained silent while running. Then finally they have reached 
outside the employee&#39;s entrance. Minako was relieved to see that there 
are police approaching them. The head chief and the two female 
bodyguards put their guns to rest but Rei didn&#39;t. She didn&#39;t recognize 
the police&#39;s brown and beige uniforms

&quot;Relax Hino. These are the police from Taito Headquarters. They are 
assigned here outside the employee&#39;s entrance. We&#39;ve planned to bring 
Aino-san here minutes before we saw you in the hallway&quot; Said the head 
chief to her as he noticed his niece isn&#39;t putting her gun down. Rei 
looked at Minako who nodded at her. She sighed then put down her gun

&quot;Very well&quot; Rei said. The officer in command approached the head chief. 
He was wearing old fashioned shades

&quot;Head chief of TNPH am I correct sir? I&#39;m the head of the security in 
this area&quot; Said the officer then the head chief nodded and shook hands 
with him

&quot;Officer, I would like some of your men check the area inside the hall 
way that leads both to the fourth fire exit and the stock room&quot; 
Commanded the head chief

&quot;I&#39;m afraid that isn&#39;t necessary sir. My men surely handled them 
perfectly. So I guess we can easily kidnap Aino-san right?&quot; Said the 
officer as he smirked

&quot;What do you mean-&quot;

BANG!

&quot;No! Big boss!&quot;

&quot;Uncle!&quot; Rei yelled as the police behind the officer shot the head chief 
in his right chest and fell down. Rei and the two bodyguards quickly 
draw their guns as the other fake Kyoto police pointed their guns to 
them. Minako hugged Rei tightly as the raven-haired bodyguard pointed 
her gun straight to the fake officer&#39;s heart

&quot;Big boss! Please tell me you&#39;re not dead!&quot; Minako yelled desperately at 
the limp body of the head chief

&quot;You! You killed the ones who were in those uniforms didn&#39;t you?&quot; Rei 
asked, glimpsing every three seconds to her unconscious uncle

&quot;I guess it&#39;s pretty obvious Ms. Bodyguard. And I&#39;m telling you, you 
definitely can&#39;t win if it is three against three dozen of us. So if you 
still value your own life then hand Aino-san peacefully to us&quot; The fake 
officer replied coolly

&quot;I&#39;m not ill minded as you think. Can&#39;t you just understand what the 
word &#39;Bodyguard&#39; meant?&quot; Asked Rei sarcastically

&quot;You can&#39;t win against us. You know that&quot;

&quot;Try me&quot; Rei said as she looks alertly to all over them in case they 
will repeat the same thing that happened to the head chief

Minako look desperately at her lover

&quot;Rei-chan, they&#39;re right. You&#39;ll hurt yourself and it&#39;s one of the 
things I never wanted to happen&quot; She whispered

&quot;I don&#39;t want to give you to them either! And I&#39;ll make sure they will 
never succeed in whatever they&#39;ve planned to do to you&quot; Rei hissed. She 
looked at her fellow female bodyguards, they&#39;re still alert and they 
weren&#39;t faltering either. This gave a little confidence to Rei

Meanwhile at the top of a small building next to the theatre a sniper is 
aiming his long-ranged gun to Rei. He was about to pull the trigger when 
somebody knocked him down from his back

&quot;I&#39;m afraid you&#39;ll wake up in the prison sniper boy&quot; Said a tall man 
with a spiky brownish blonde hair and gray eyes. He looked at the 
direction where Rei and Minako are in

&quot;Damn, I can&#39;t do anything rash. If only I&#39;m as fast as Leonard I&#39;d be 
able to help the cop girl...I should wait for them there. But if things 
happen unexpectedly I&#39;ll move into action without them&quot; He said to 
himself as he silently jumps across the top building of the theatre then 
run at the top where below stood all the fake police, Minako and the 
others

&quot;What now Ms. Bodyguard? We don&#39;t have forever you know&quot; Said the fake 
officer

Rei didn&#39;t respond. Instead she is looking at the fake officer&#39;s shades&#39; 
reflection where another fake police in the back nodded and improved the 
aim of his gun

&quot;You have a nice pair of shades...Mr. Officer&quot; Rei slowly said

&quot;I don&#39;t see what&#39;s with those flattering words but these pair of shades 
I&#39;m wearing is very helpful especially when I&#39;m on disguise&quot; The fake 
officer proudly said

&quot;Yes, I agree it&#39;s really helpful...because they happen to help me too&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t be confused with that&quot; The fake officer gave his signal at the 
fake police in front of the female bodyguard

&quot;Dock!&quot; Rei yelled to her fellow female bodyguards then she pulled 
Minako down, pulled the trigger of her gun and fired the bullet straight 
to the fake officer&#39;s heart that instantly caused him his death

&quot;Continue with the main plan! But don&#39;t hit Aino-san!&quot; One of the fake 
police yelled to his companions

&quot;That&#39;s for my uncle!&quot; Rei yelled as she wildly fires her gun to every 
fake police she points her gun to. She covered Minako as much as she 
can, afraid that the pop star might get hit

Suddenly a spiky brownish blonde-haired man holding a huge, long log 
jumped in the middle and he swung the huge log circularly, hitting down 
many fake police men out of their consciousness

&quot;Minako, come with me here!&quot; Minako stood as she still held Rei&#39;s arm 
and they run together at the back of a white carriage truck. Together 
they watched the man carrying a huge log knock some fake police men off 
their feet

&#39;Whoa, he&#39;s strong!&#39; Rei thought

&quot;Hey cop girl! What were you just thinking? If you succeed getting 
yourself killed Sanctuary will surely kill me!&quot; He yelled angrily at Rei

&quot;So you&#39;re with Sanctuary! What a perfect reunion of terrorists!&quot; Rei 
yelled back after shooting a fake police who was about to grab Minako&#39;s 
hand

&quot;Save your worries for Sanctuary, we&#39;re helping you protect your 
girlfriend so that our promise to you will be fulfilled. By the way, I&#39;m 
Grey!&quot; He said as he crushes three fake police to a nearby wall

&#39;W-what? H-how did he know that Rei-chan and I are...?&#39; Minako thought

&quot;I was beginning to--watch out!&quot; Rei called

Grey took her warning and dodged the bullet who was about to hit him

&quot;We&#39;ll talk later!&quot; Grey said

Rei acknowledged the bodyguards who were with them. She cursed when one 
of Minako&#39;s temporary bodyguards was shot in the right leg and neck, 
which caused her to lose consciousness. The other bodyguard was also 
unconscious. Rei cursed again

Minako caught sight of her cell phone a meter away from them. She must 
have dropped it when they were running for cover

&quot;My cell! Rei-chan I&#39;ll call for help!&quot; Minako yelled as she crawls and 
tries to reach for her cell phone

&quot;Minako, don&#39;t go there!&quot; Rei yelled as she loses her aim and followed 
Minako. This gave the fake police a chance and he fired his gun hitting 
Rei on her left shoulder. The pop star gasped

&quot;Rei-chan, you&#39;re hurt!&quot;

&quot;Hey! You okay?&quot; Grey asked

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m still-aah!&quot;

A masked man inside the carriage of the white truck hit Rei&#39;s head with 
the back of his rifle that finally caused the bodyguard to loose 
consciousness

&quot;No!&quot; Minako yelled again

&quot;Quick! Get Aino-san! Start the truck quickly!&quot; The masked man yelled at 
the rest of the fake police men and they run towards the pop star and 
seized her

&quot;Hey! What do you think you&#39;re-argh!&quot; Grey was interrupted when someone 
shot him behind his upper back that caused him to loose balance and fall 
down to the ground

&quot;Let&#39;s go! Leave the others! Go-go-go now!&quot; The masked man yelled as the 
truck moved although the carriage door is still open and sped away from 
them

&quot;Let me go! Reeeeiii!&quot; Minako yelled but Rei is still unconscious

&quot;No! Dammit!&quot; Grey yelled as he hastily stood up and run to try and 
catch up with the truck carrying Minako but he failed

--

&quot;I said let me go! You guys have caused so much death and trouble for 
me!&quot;

Minako fought the fake police men&#39;s grip and screamed as loud as she 
can. She kicked one of them in the face, the man behind her injected a 
sleeper to her arm and within a few seconds the drug had put the pop 
star into deep slumber

--

&quot;Hey cop girl, wake up!&quot; Grey shook Rei&#39;s shoulder. The raven-haired 
agent shifted

&quot;Ooww...not the right shoulder...&quot; Rei mumbled then for a few seconds 
her eyes opened and stood up as she gasped sharply

&quot;Minako!&quot;

&quot;I thought you forgot about your girlfriend&quot; Grey commented as he tried 
to help Rei get up but she refused and got herself up instead. She 
noticed a small whole at the back of Grey&#39;s right shoulder

&quot;You&#39;re shot&quot;

&quot;So are you. But the thing is, I have a bullet-proof vest, you 
don&#39;t...Where on earth are Mark and the others anyway?&quot; Grey said as he 
rips his black long sleeve and revealed his bullet-proof vest

Rei blushed at Grey&#39;s well-formed biceps but slap herself mentally after 
she remembered what happened

&quot;I&#39;ve got to follow Minako! They used the white truck that was here 
minutes ago right? And where are the other freekin&#39; cops? They should 
have been here hours ago!&quot; She said as she run forward to a parked navy 
blue Honda Civic. Grey followed her immediately

&quot;Hey-hey-hey! I think you&#39;re not in the condition to drive a car and 
that will be called car-napping if you do drive someone else&#39;s car!&quot; 
Grey said

Rei looked at the head chief&#39;s still form

&quot;Please look after my uncle, the one who wears a gray Americana&quot;

&quot;Who told you I&#39;ll let you-Hey watch out!&quot; Grey said as he grabs Rei&#39;s 
right arm and pulled her away from hitting a speeding white sports car 
which stopped seven meters in front of them

&quot;Of all you can pull on me, why my right arm!?&quot; Rei yelled at him and 
winced at her arm that Grey pulled

Grey ignored her and he marched angrily towards the sports car in their 
front

&quot;Damn you Henry! You almost killed us!&quot; Grey yelled at the driver&#39;s 
window which slowly opened and revealed another man with short 
white-blonde hair and green eyes

&quot;Well-I&#39;m-So-Sorry! This happens to be a sports car and is difficult to 
control!&quot; He replied sarcastically. The back door opened and the young 
man with a feather got out from it followed by a thin brown-haired man 
with red eyes

Rei blinked at the sight of four handsome men looking at her

&quot;S-Sanctuary...&quot; Rei mumbled as she walks cautiously to them

The young man with a feather gasped softly when he saw Rei

&quot;Rei-san, you&#39;re head&#39;s bleeding!&quot; He said as he approaches but Rei 
stepped back

&quot;Don&#39;t scare the cop girl Edward, take that feather away, it looks 
creepy on you&quot; Grey said

&quot;But-&quot;

&quot;Please help me get back Minako&quot; Rei pleaded as she grabs Edward&#39;s hand

&quot;Of course, that&#39;s why we&#39;re here&quot; Edward said

&quot;Yes. We promised you Ms. Aino&#39;s safety right?&quot; The clef-chinned Mark 
replied while smirking

&quot;Well, what are waiting for? Let&#39;s go now, Leonard&#39;s on the chopper and 
he got the pop star on track&quot; Henry said as he gets back inside the 
driver&#39;s seat and they all followed

&quot;Wait-what about my uncle, he&#39;s-&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ve called ambulance here so don&#39;t worry. We have to get out of here 
before they see us. I hope you haven&#39;t forgot that we&#39;re one of the most 
wanted terrorists here&quot; Mark said as he enters the front passenger seat 
next to Henry

The car sped its way to Hurumi Avenue. They were suppose to turn right 
to Chuo Street but Mark changed his mind

&quot;There&#39;s not much traffic in Hurumi today so just go straight ahead&quot; He 
said

&quot;According to Leonard they took Chuo Street, he said they seem to be 
heading to Kasuga Avenue, because the carriage truck belonged to a 
factory in there&quot; Henry said as he looks at the instant message at the 
laptop of the car

&quot;Then we&#39;ll intercept them on Yasukumi Avenue corner Chuo street. So 
you&#39;ll be turning right to Uchibiori Street this time Henry&quot; Instructed 
Mark

&quot;Where is that?&quot; Asked Henry

&quot;It&#39;s the third street to the right that we are going to pass so let&#39;s 
hurry so that we can catch them in time&quot;

Meanwhile Rei silently watches the front window of the car, hoping that 
anytime she would see the truck that took Minako minutes ago. Suddenly 
someone handed her a white handkerchief, she looked at the owner, and it 
was Edward

&quot;The blood&#39;s almost covering your eye. Please wipe it, it bothers me&quot; 
Edward said to her

Rei looked at the handkerchief then back to Edward. Then she slowly took 
it from his hands

&quot;Thanks&quot; Rei whispered weakly. Then next to her, Grey suddenly spoke

&quot;What took you guys so long anyway? Cop girl and I are almost risking 
ourselves to death there!&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re truly sorry. It took us time to distract the police from going to 
the employee&#39;s entrance&quot; Mark explained

&quot;So you guys are the reason why there isn&#39;t a single police came to back 
us out there&quot; Rei said

&quot;It will be messier if they arrive there in that situation&quot; Henry 
answered

&quot;...Yes, I just thought of that. I just can&#39;t figure out how you handled 
a thousand police from different headquarters of Tokyo&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Sanctuary&#39;s secret. Sanctuary became famous because of that. 
Leaving people the thought that how did five individuals do crimes that 
take a great number of men to handle. Now there will be six because of 
you&quot; Edward explained

&quot;I&#39;m just a side dish. I don&#39;t have any special skills except for 
shooting guns and-&quot;

&quot;Solving crimes through instincts. Don&#39;t think we didn&#39;t know anything 
about your records, Hino-chan&quot; Mark interrupted

&quot;How the hell did you know about it? Have you guys been stalking at me 
ever since from the start?&quot; Rei bellowed

&quot;No. Just recently when Ms. Aino arrived here few days ago. It&#39;s thanks 
to her that we have given the opportunity to finally make a move&quot;

&quot;Look, is that the truck?&quot; Henry suddenly asked as a white carriage 
truck crossed the road as it rampaged

Rei&#39;s heart beat became faster

&quot;That&#39;s it! Turn there Henry!&quot; Grey said

&quot;Absolutely&quot; Then Henry stirred the wheel to the right and followed the 
truck in an incredible speed

&quot;What do we do? Knock the driver and stop the truck?&quot; Grey asked

&quot;No, we&#39;re in the district full of police headquarters and we can&#39;t risk 
catching their attention. We&#39;ll have to get the pop star while the truck 
is still running&quot; Mark replied

The carriage truck noticed someone&#39;s following them, it became faster 
than before. But the sports car is a lot faster and it eventually 
catches up with the truck in equal speed. The truck shifted then hit the 
sports car to knock it off the road. Once they slow down the carriage 
door opened and five fake police appeared firing their riffles at the 
sports car

&quot;You -- bastards! This is a million dollar sports car!&quot; Yelled Henry 
with fury

&quot;I&#39;ll buy you a much better one Henry just line up with the truck so 
that we can jump in to it&quot; Mark said then he opened the door beside him

&quot;Fine! But only a Mustang will cheer me up!&quot; Henry then stepped on the 
clutch to catch up once again with the truck (AN: &quot;Mustang&quot; is a car 
model/company. But I know it&#39;s a car model)

&quot;I&#39;m coming with you!&quot; Rei spoke

&quot;No, we&#39;ll handle this. Please trust Ms. Aino&#39;s safety with us Rei-san&quot; 
Edward said

&quot;B-but-&quot;

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;ll just slow us down cop girl!&quot; Grey joked then he opened the 
back door at his right

Edward held his feather from its tip and drew a rectangle vertically in 
the mid-air in front of the steel side wall of the truck. Then suddenly 
a huge rectangular hole appeared in it, revealing two fake police and 
two masked men holding an unconscious Minako, both the pop star&#39;s hands 
and feet are tied with ripped clothing. They were startled and moved out 
of their sight

&quot;Minako!&quot; Yelled Rei but Grey held her back

&quot;Grey, Ed, let&#39;s go!&quot; Mark called them and he jumped above the sports 
car&#39;s front cover then jumped at the hole followed by Grey

&quot;Stay here Rei-san! Watch her for us Henry&quot; Edward said before closing 
the door of the sports car and jumped inside the truck leaving Rei 
mouth-opened

&quot;H-how did he put a hole in there using a feather?&quot; Rei asked in 
disbelief

&quot;That&#39;s Edward&#39;s gift&quot; Henry said as he slows the car down

&quot;Wait, why are slowing down? Catch up with them!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want to damage this baby any further because of you&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll jump to that car next to us if you don&#39;t catch up with them!&quot; Rei 
threatened

&quot;W-what!?&quot; Henry exclaimed

Rei opened the door to her left where Edward jumped off, Henry panicked

&quot;Don&#39;t jump damn it! You&#39;re as thick-headed as I ever imagined! Alright, 
I&#39;ll catch up with them just don&#39;t do anything stupid!&quot; Henry sped the 
car behind the truck&#39;s open carriage doors so that the truck won&#39;t try 
to crush them

Rei stopped moving but she didn&#39;t close the door so that she can clearly 
see what&#39;s happening inside the truck

--

-At the truck-

The chase brought them from the theatre to the clear roads of Hongo 
Avenue where there are only few cars passing by. Which is for Sanctuary, 
gives them an advantage from chasing the kidnappers

&quot;Grey, stay at the hole and wait for my signal to go at the driver&#39;s 
seat&quot; Mark said as he fires his gun while Edward wave his feather to 
vanish the bullets speeding in their direction. Some of the kidnappers 
Mark had shot fell from the carriage door that was left open behind 
them. Seconds later the gunshots stopped and the only ones left alive 
were the unconscious pop star held by a shaking kidnapper near the open 
door, standing meters in front of him are Mark, Edward and Grey who were 
still standing near the hole Edward made

&quot;It seems you&#39;re the only one left here&quot; Mark said

&quot;Handle Aino-san to us&quot;

The kidnapper furiously shook his head then pointed the tip of his gun 
at the neck of the unconscious pop star

&quot;N-no! Don&#39;t move! I&#39;ll-I&#39;ll shoot her if you do!&quot; He said as he tries 
to smirk

&quot;You&#39;re gun&#39;s out of ammo&quot; Grey commented like telling today&#39;s weather. 
The kidnapper turned pale white

&quot;H-how can you tell? I&#39;ll shoot her! I&#39;m not kidding!&quot; He tried to 
pretend but he was faltering. Suddenly an idea struck the kidnapper&#39;s 
mind and brought back a little color to his face

&quot;If we can&#39;t get Aino-san, then no one will!&quot; The kidnapper smirked 
madly and he threw Minako&#39;s sleeping form off the truck

&quot;NOO!&quot; Mark and Edward yelled

--

-At the sports car behind the right side of the truck-

&quot;Shit, the pop star!&quot; Yelled Henry

&quot;Minakooo!&quot; Rei screamed in horror and jumped from the open car door she 
was just holding and caught the pop star&#39;s body in time before they fell 
off the road. Rei rolled their positions so that she will be the first 
one to receive the impact. Rei felt her neck break but still held the 
pop star tight in her arms as they rolled wildly and then finally they 
stopped

Rei felt her body and mind slowly shutting down but she managed to look 
at the pop star that she lets go after they stopped rolling. Minako&#39;s 
head is bleeding badly but she is still unconscious

&quot;...nako...&quot; She mumbled painfully as she desperately moves her 
undamaged arm and held the pop star&#39;s blood-covered face

&quot;...no...got to...hospital&quot;

Suddenly the sports car Rei was riding before arrived. All four members 
of Sanctuary came out from the car and run towards them

&quot;Rei-san!&quot; Edward rushed at Rei&#39;s side and held her weak form

&quot;We&#39;ve got to get out of here! Leonard said the police are on their way 
here fast!&quot; Henry said

Mark nodded then looked from Minako, to Rei and then to Edward. Then he 
finally spoke

&quot;Grey, stay here and make sure that Ms. Aino here will be in safe hands. 
Leonard will be waiting for the pop star&#39;s arrival at whatever hospital 
she may go into. Let&#39;s go before anybody sees us. Edward, take Hino-chan 
and we&#39;ll get her away from here&quot;

Grey looked at him with disbelief but he nodded anyway and hid away to a 
place nearby to guard Minako until the ambulance take her

&quot;No...Minako...needs help&quot; Rei weakly said

Edward nodded to Mark then lifted Rei. The raven haired agent pushed 
Edward off and fell on to her knees

&quot;I said...MINAKO-NEEDS-HELP!&quot; She managed to yell but not loud enough

&quot;Rei-san...&quot;

&quot;I won&#39;t go anywhere...until I see that Minako&#39;s doing fine!&quot; She 
breathed. Tears are now starting to fall from her dust-covered cheeks

Edward looked at her with pity while Mark is as solid as stone. He 
approached at the agent and took Rei&#39;s right shoulder gently

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. Sanctuary broke a promise&quot; He coldly said then Edward took 
Rei&#39;s other shoulder and pulled her away from her pop star lover. She 
tried to escape but there is no way she could especially in her 
condition. All she can do is to struggle weakly and yell while tears 
flowing endlessly from both of her eyes

&quot;Please, let go! Minako! MINAKOOOO!&quot; She yelled from the last ounce of 
her strength. Her hand reached out to Minako&#39;s lone form which is slowly 
blurring, until she could see no more but darkness

Minako...
