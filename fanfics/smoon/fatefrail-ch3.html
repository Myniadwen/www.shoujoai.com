Meeting You Again

Life did not become any easier for Ami since her first confrontation 
with Nishikawa; she knew it wouldn&#39;t be from the very beginning. It was 
because of this reason that Ami decided it was safer to come to school 
earlier than necessary to avoid any unsupervised meetings with him. She 
would hide in the girl&#39;s bathroom until the bell rang and would wait 
thirty minutes more just to make sure their tardy teacher arrived at the 
classroom before she did. She was not surprised to know that her 
homeroom teacher didn&#39;t care if she was late.

She didn&#39;t leave the school unscathed, however. When everybody heard 
that she was Nishikawa&#39;s latest target, everyone else started to play 
pranks on her. They would put disgusting things in her locker. They 
would steal her lunch or her shoes. They would call her hurtful names 
and make up some disgusting stories about her while she was within 
hearing range. They haven&#39;t resorted to any physical bullying yet. But 
the meek, blue-haired girl knew that it was only a matter of time...

She hadn&#39;t seen the tall, brunette girl for three days since their 
collision at the entrance. She did not know how she felt about that. For 
some reason, she believed that the other girl would understand how she 
felt and what she was going through. She had an aura of grim 
determination... The resolute strength that only a person, who had 
experienced a lot of hardships, could ever have. The kind of tenacity 
and fierceness that Ami lacked and envied. But in spite of these rough 
qualities, she knew that the other girl was kind.

It was the way she looked at her, the way she spoke... apologetic and 
embarrassed for causing the both of them to fall that one fateful day-- 
the careful way she helped her up.

She wanted to meet her. She wanted to ask for her help.

She had asked herself before, &#39;Am I fooling myself? Am I assuming too 
much?&#39; Deep down she knew she was. But she found she was hesitant to 
kill that little spark of hope in her. Once she did, she knew she was 
going to break down and cry.

Everyday for three days, she would look around the sea of indifferent 
faces in hopes of catching a glimpse of the infamous Makoto and worried 
over her absence when she didn&#39;t show up.

On the fourth day, she was late for school. It hadn&#39;t been her fault 
really... She had woken up as early as always, but her dad had gotten 
sick and she had to prepare the things a sick person would need before 
heading off to school.

She was walking towards the entrance, possessively clutching her 
brown-leather book bag. She was not letting go of it any time soon. It 
the last thing her parents bought for her together as Christmas gift for 
her before they divorced. It was the only thing, besides her dwindling 
hope for Makoto&#39;s reappearance, which kept her going.

Then she noticed a couple of students loitering just outside the gate, 
watching everyone else walk through. Ami stopped and swallowed hard when 
she recognized their sneering and bandaged faces.

&quot;Look! It&#39;s frickin&#39; her!&quot; Usui suddenly exclaimed and pointed in her 
direction and Nishikawa, Endo and Inouye all turned to look. The first 
one to smile was Nishikawa. He seemed almost pleased to see her.

Ami took a step back, about to run away, when she bumped against 
someone. She whirled around quickly to see Makoto stare right back at 
her, her deceptively slender hands had abruptly grabbed on to the 
smaller girl&#39;s shoulders to keep her from stumbling.

&quot;You never watch where you&#39;re going, do you?&quot; Makoto muttered, sounding 
a little annoyed and amused at the same time. When she looked back up to 
the other guys, her frown deepened. &quot;Great... I shouldn&#39;t have come 
back.&quot; Despite the regret in those words, and the noticeable reluctance 
on her face, she strode on ahead-- leaving Ami to stare after her in 
surprise.

The blue-haired girl was so relieved to see her, she wanted to cry. But 
instead, she hurried after Makoto and settled in a steady pace behind 
her. The bullies at the gate laughed at this.

&quot;Oi!&quot; Inouye, the boy with the dreadlocks, called out, &quot;Kino-yaro! Is 
that your new bitch! Can we borrow her to play with, sometime?&quot; Ami felt 
her cheeks heat up in humiliation.

&quot;Shut up you bastards or I&#39;ll shut it for you...&quot; Makoto growled as she 
walked past them and through the gate. The smaller girl wanted to smile 
at her and thank her for defending her, but she felt her self being 
yanked to one side and was pulled against a large and muscular body.

&quot;So you don&#39;t mind? Nishikawa called out to Makoto as he ran his hand 
through Ami&#39;s hair. She cringed at his touch and tried to pull away. But 
the behemoth Endo, who had locked her arms behind her back, was 
freakishly strong and held her fast.

&quot;No, please!&quot; She whimpered. She looked towards Makoto and was shocked 
to see her continue to walk away without even leaving a backward glance. 
&quot;No!&quot; She yelled desperately and redoubled her efforts to get away. 
&quot;Kino-san!&quot; She cried out. She saw the brunette stop before she could 
walk through the school building&#39;s entrance. The tall girl finally 
turned her head to look at her. Ami&#39;s eyes were wide with disbelief when 
she saw the apathy in her face, mirroring everyone else&#39;s expressions as 
they passed by and pretended not to notice her. Ami felt the ground 
leave her and only Endo&#39;s firm grip kept her from crumpling to the 
ground.

Makoto shrugged and disappeared inside.

Nishikawa stood to block her view and crossed his arms over his proud 
chest. He looked down at her with a smirk. &quot;Well, well... Looks like 
your girlfriend doesn&#39;t care about you after all.&quot; He leaned in close to 
stare into her frightened eyes, conveying every dark intention he had 
for her in his angry gaze.

She began to tremble. Her knees weakened under the force of this boy&#39;s 
animosity. It was like he was full of hatred for everything and 
everyone. But there was also pleasure in his malicious regard for her as 
he fed off on her fear. Finally he nodded over to Endo. The large boy 
nodded back before he pushed Ami away roughly-- wrenching the book bag 
out of her hands in the process.

She fell to the ground and grazed her elbow against the cracked surface 
of the pavement. She yelped and clutched at the wound as it began to 
bleed. Endo quirked a humorless smile at her. &quot;We&#39;ll be taking this.&quot; He 
told her as he held out the bag for her to see.

Usui cackled and grabbed it away from his hands. &quot;Did she bring her 
frickin&#39; lunch? It better be frickin&#39; delicious &#39;cuz I&#39;m frickin&#39; 
hungry!&quot; He tore her bag open and fished around inside, throwing papers 
and pencils away which impeded his search. Inouye, oddly enough, bent to 
pick up the pencils which he stuffed inside his pocket.

&quot;No! Please! That&#39;s my homework!&quot; Ami was in tears as she stumbled to 
her feet and tried to grab her bag back. Nishikawa snatched it before 
she could and held it over her head.

&quot;Homework! Are you listening to this?&quot; He jeered and wrapped his hand 
around her head to keep her at arm&#39;s length. &quot;She&#39;s actually DOING her 
homework! What a nerd!&quot;

Ami flailed her arms in a frantic effort to grab any part of her bag and 
accidentally hit the side of Nishikawa&#39;s face. She gasped and froze. The 
hand over her face tightened to a painful degree before it released her. 
Then, without warning, it lashed out to smack her right back with a 
vengeance. She fell to the ground again. Her head was swimming with pain 
and dizziness.

&quot;Bitch!&quot; Nishikawa made to lunge at her, but Endo quickly rushed to grab 
him around the waist and lifted him back.

&quot;Whoah! Aniki! Don&#39;t go too far!&quot;

&quot;Yeah, too many frickin&#39; outside witnesses, bro!&quot;

&quot;Fuck! Let go of me!&quot;

&quot;Shit... Let&#39;s just get out of here...&quot;

Ami did not notice Nishikawa throw the bag at her, which bounced 
harmlessly off her head. She did not notice them leave. She even did not 
notice how everyone else jostled her as they walked past.

Numb, she shakily wiped the tears from her face, stood up and stared 
hollowly at the clear and sunny sky.

The classroom was buzzing as almost all of the students gathered around 
the windows to watch the events unfold outside. Makoto entered the room 
in such a setting. She ignored the whispers around her as she went to 
her seat and sat down.

She was in a foul mood. Earlier this morning, Seiya and Yaten kept 
teasing her about her unintentional t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te with Aino Minako. She 
was forced to escape them by finally going to school. Then, she had an 
encounter with four of her LEAST favorite people in the world. And 
what&#39;s worse... it looked like the new girl was brought into the middle 
of the madness.

Makoto felt a little guilty about that. But then again, she really had 
nothing to do with the girl. SHE was the one who approached her-- for 
reasons the tall girl could not fathom-- who obviously knew WHO she was 
and probably knew about her reputation. The stupid ones, bearing all 
these things in mind, knew it wasn&#39;t a good idea to get near her or they 
would find themselves sucked into the conflict. Heck... Even Makoto knew 
that herself-- which was why she never dared help anyone in fear of 
worsening their fates. Was this new girl even stupider? She had to 
wonder though, what the other girl did to merit Nishikawa&#39;s attention 
like that.

&quot;Whoah shit! He hit her!&quot;

Makoto&#39;s head snapped up at that. &#39;What!&#39; She shot to her feet and 
stormed over to the window in time to see the blue-haired girl go down. 
She winced, feeling guiltier and guiltier for leaving her helpless at 
Nishikawa&#39;s mercy. She did not expect the stupid idiot to go that far 
though. She knew him to be the type to only resort to physical violence 
if he was hurt first.

&quot;Damn it!&quot; She yelled and ran out of the classroom, startling a few of 
her classmates nearby. By the time she was outside, Nishikawa and his 
gang, and the new girl were nowhere to be seen. She looked around just 
to make sure. She did not even catch a glimpse of her. Her shoulders 
sagged with defeat, the guilt weighing it down even further. She could 
not give up. What if the others dragged her away somewhere to pummel her 
to pieces?

Then she caught sight of a boy who was sipping at his juice box, 
watching her from his spot near the entrance. She realized had seen him 
when she walked in earlier. Her eyes gleamed as she moved towards him.

The boy, upon seeing Makoto approach, choked on his juice. Coughing, he 
tried to run away but the she had already grabbed him by scruff of his 
neck and forcefully pulled him towards her. &quot;Where is she!&quot; She snarled 
into his face. &quot;And don&#39;t you even dare pull one over me. I know you&#39;ve 
seen them!&quot;

&quot;S-she went th-tha-that way.&quot; The boy pointed a quivering finger to his 
left. &quot;W-went straight ah-ahead.&quot; She dropped him on his ass and ran in 
the direction where he pointed. She hoped she was not too late.

She ran straight down the road, whipping her head back and forth for any 
possible places that one could drag someone away from prying eyes. Just 
when she was about to go inside an alley, she caught a glimpse of 
blue-hair and stopped. She stood, gasping for breath, a few meters in 
front of the town center&#39;s fountain.

There she was, ALONE and safe, sitting on the fountain with her head 
bent down and her arms wrapped tightly around a battered bag.

Makoto approached her cautiously and paused when the other&#39;s head shot 
up. She frowned when she caught sight of a darkening bruise near her 
right jaw. Then she steeled her nerves and took careful inventory of the 
girl&#39;s body. Other than the bruise on her jaw and the small, bloody 
scratch on her right elbow, she seemed relatively unharmed.

Makoto tried to approach again and felt ashamed when the other girl 
flinched back. She held her hands up in a mollifying gesture. &quot;It&#39;s 
okay.&quot; She told her softly and carefully moved towards her again. The 
girl stiffened but did not move away when Makoto sat beside her, keeping 
a respectful distance between them.

Silence reigned for a few minutes as both tried to gather their thoughts 
in regards to the unfortunate events earlier. Finally, Makoto decided to 
speak first and quietly told her, &quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She waited for a few 
tense moments before Ami replied, in a small and broken voice...

&quot;Why?&quot;

&#39;Why?&#39; The brunette thought. Why didn&#39;t she help her? Why was she here 
now? She decided to answer the easier one and tried to meet her eyes, to 
try and express her sincerity, with no success. &quot;So you wouldn&#39;t get 
hurt.&quot;

Ami practically crumbled before her eyes.

The smaller girl hugged her bag even tighter, and burrowed into a small, 
protective ball to try to keep the pieces of herself together. She 
wanted to laugh at the stupidity of the answer but was afraid that if 
she did, she wouldn&#39;t stop. &quot;I got hurt.&quot; She retorted, her voice quiet 
but accusatory.

Makoto looked away from her, her lips twisting in a small 
self-deprecating smile. &quot;It would&#39;ve been worse if I helped you.&quot; She 
knew that, and yet she could not help but feel like she had just 
betrayed her.

Ami could not and would not understand. She was feeling numb to the 
point of not caring about anything anymore. She just wanted to go home, 
into the solace of her room and immerse herself in her father&#39;s Art 
books. But her father... Her sick father would be worried if he saw her 
and could not find it in herself to go home in such a pathetic state.

She started when Makoto rose and offered her hand to her. She looked at 
the appendage dumbly before looking up at her questioningly. She saw the 
kind smile on the other&#39;s face, which seemed rather forced. But she 
could also see the effort behind it. &quot;Let&#39;s go to the Crown.&quot;

&quot;Why?&quot; Ami asked warily.

Makoto shrugged, feeling awkward and a little lost. She really didn&#39;t 
know how to comfort the other girl, or how to redeem herself for her 
grievous error. She could only try to help Ami forget about what 
happened. Frankly, Makoto felt incompetent when it came to this kind 
situation with another person involved. She was so used to being 
independent for so long that she did not know how to show compassion to 
anyone anymore. &quot;I don&#146;t know... Seems like fun... And we both need it 
now anyway.&quot;

Ami looked down unsure. She was not sure she could trust Makoto anymore. 
She felt a finger tap against the top of her skull and had to 
acknowledge it. She felt her heart stop when she saw Makoto&#39;s gentle and 
apologetic face. Something clicked... just like the first time they met. 
She knew, deep inside her, that Makoto would never abandon her again.

The hopes, that she thought had died earlier, were rekindled in that 
instance. She smiled shyly up at the taller girl and answered, 
&quot;Alright...&quot;

Makoto nodded, and felt some of the guilty weight lift off her 
shoulders. &quot;Good.&quot; She answered back with a relieved smile. She reached 
down to take Ami&#39;s hands, who blushed at the sudden contact. The 
blue-haired girl looked up at Makoto, feeling strangely nervous at how 
intently she seemed to be looking at her arm. She wasn&#39;t sure what to 
make out of her expression when she saw a hint of remorse flash in her 
eyes.

&quot;I really mean it you know?&quot; Makoto whispered quietly as she took out a 
small, white handkerchief from her skirt&#39;s hidden pocket and carefully 
wrapped it around the wound on Ami&#39;s elbow. Her fingers lingered over 
the cloth, over the wound, as she looked into the smaller girl&#39;s wide 
blue eyes. &quot;I don&#39;t know your name.&quot;

&quot;I know. I forgive you.&quot; Ami told her, looking down to hide the blush 
that was beginning to spread across her face. &#39;Makoto&#39;s touch...&#39; She 
marveled, her heart racing at the thought. She would treasure this 
wonderful feeling for a long, long time. When she looked up she was 
grinning. &quot;My friends call me Ami. Mizuno Ami.&quot;

Makoto was scowling. Ami was giggling beside her but she had to stop 
because it hurt her jaw.

&quot;I hate this game!&quot; The brunette exclaimed and kicked at the offending 
machine and crossed her arms sulkily. &quot;I bet it&#39;s rigged.&quot;

Ami tried really hard not to smile and asked to try her hand at the 
game. Makoto stood back and watched in disbelief as the other girl 
manipulated the Crane Machine&#39;s claw with ease and lifted a bright pink 
rabbit plushie among the other toys. She dropped the toy inside the hole 
then bent to retrieve it through the little black flap on the bottom of 
the glass. She held the rabbit plushie in front of Makoto&#39;s face.

The brunette did not say anything for a long, long time and Ami was 
suddenly afraid she might have angered the other girl. Suddenly, Makoto 
grabbed her hand and held it palm up before placing several more coins 
inside it. &quot;Hey, can you win some more?&quot;

&quot;Um... I can try...&quot; Ami answered, looking down and blushing. Then she 
proceeded to win as much plushies as she could for Makoto. When they 
returned to their booth, the taller girl practically carried an arm-full 
of colorful plushies.

Both of the girls sat across from each other, so it was clear for Ami to 
see how pleased Makoto seemed to be with her new treasures. &quot;I didn&#39;t 
take you for a plushie maniac, Kino-san.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not.&quot; The brunette looked aghast at the thought. &quot;But it&#39;s such a 
bargain to get these many plushies for only 50 yen each... You could say 
I love bargains.&quot;

Ami was so happy to be able to see this new side of Makoto, she was 
practically beaming. She had never desired to know someone as much as 
she wanted to know about the girl in front of her. She decided, secretly 
to herself, that she would do anything to become her friend and be close 
to her.

&quot;Really?&quot; She leaned forward slightly in anticipation as she asked the 
following question, &quot;what else does Kino-san love?&quot;

Makoto thought for a minute, before shrugging and answering, &quot;Well... I 
love to cook. There&#39;s not much to cook in my place though. I&#39;m not 
exactly that well-off.&quot; She looked at Ami pointedly, &quot;Like most of the 
kids in Juuban.&quot;

The smaller girl nodded, &quot;I know what you mean. You could say I&#39;m on the 
same boat as you are. But it hadn&#39;t always been like that.&quot; She looked 
up to see if the other girl would care to listen to her story and found 
Makoto looking right back at her patiently. &quot;I lived in a condominium. I 
used to study in Mugen Gakuen. I was one of the top ten smartest 
students in school.&quot;

&quot;And let me guess...&quot; Makoto smirked, resting her chin on the palm of 
her hand as she tilted her head to look down at Ami in amusement. &quot;You 
had lots of friends, you had loving parents, you had a great life...&quot; 
She could not help it. The picture perfect description made her bitter 
inside. Of course she would not show that to Ami. She bottled her 
negative feelings inside with practiced ease.

Then she realized that Ami had suddenly grown quiet and wondered if she 
just said something offensive.

&quot;My... My parents divorced. And I have no other friends except my best 
friend... People just don&#39;t like me I guess.&quot; Ami lowered her eyes, 
ashamed at the ineptitude of her existence.

Makoto wanted to kick herself. She should&#39;ve known that one of the 
reasons why Ami came to a school like Juuban was because of something 
like that. She had no right to impose her bitterness on the other girl. 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; She told her. &quot;Kami, I seem to be doing you a lot of wrong 
today.&quot;

&quot;No, no, Kino-san.&quot; Ami shook her head furiously and smiled at her. &quot;You 
couldn&#39;t have known.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Look, friends forgive each other. So it&#39;s okay.&quot; She watched, and was 
slightly alarmed at how quickly an unreadable mask came over Makoto&#39;s 
face. She anxiously bowed her head several times as she apologized 
fervently, &quot;I&#39;m so sorry! I am assuming too much. I know you don&#39;t 
really consider me as a friend, Kino-san. I&#39;m really sorry.&quot; When she 
was done, she kept her head down in sorrow. She knew it was just too 
good to be true. A self-reliant person like Makoto had no need for a 
weakling like her.

For the brunette&#39;s part, she was afraid and unsure. To be friends with 
Ami would mean signing the girl&#39;s own death warrant. Makoto had a lot of 
enemies, she had a past she could not run away from, and felt she would 
only bring people down with all the extra baggage she was carrying.

&quot;Mizuno-san,&quot; Makoto began quietly, &quot;I&#39;ll only hurt you. I can&#39;t be your 
friend.&quot;

&quot;How will you hurt me?&quot; Ami asked just as softly, slowly straightening 
to look at the other girl through her eyelashes. &quot;You&#39;re the first 
person to show kindness to me since I came to Juuban. You came after me 
earlier because you were worried about me. How can such a compassionate 
person like you hurt me?&quot;

&quot;I have a lot of enemies. If they find out you&#39;re my friend, they will 
come after you.&quot;

&quot;Then I will not leave your side.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s crazy!&quot;

&quot;It seems that way.&quot; The blue-haired answered back adamantly. Makoto did 
not outright reject her friendship, which gave her the hope that she 
might just win her over if she was stubborn enough. But the brunette 
just shook her head and rose to leave.

Ami was desperate now. If Makoto left, she would never get another 
chance. &quot;Even if I have to put up with people like Nishikawa, I am not 
leaving you alone until you like me!&quot; She yelled to the sudden silence 
of the restaurant.

Makoto stared down at her, stunned. Ami stared back at her, red-faced 
and embarrassed but firm and unyielding. The brunette could feel her 
resolve weakening, the beginnings of a real smile started to twitch at 
the corner of her lips. When she sat back down, conversation in the 
restaurant resumed. &quot;You&#39;re so annoying, you know that?&quot; Makoto 
half-complained and half-complimented.

&quot;So I&#39;ve been told.&quot; Came the sheepish reply.

&quot;It&#39;s not going to be easy though...&quot; The taller girl added seriously.

&quot;Nothing ever is.&quot; Ami answered knowingly.

Minako was exhausted when she came home to her empty room in the hotel. 
She had decided to stay another night in Roppongi, and had been partying 
herself to the bone. She also met a lot of great-looking guys tonight 
and had a grand time being gushed over and worshipped. More than once, 
however, she found her thoughts straying to a certain green-eyed boy.

She wondered if she would ever see him again. If she did what would she 
do? What did she want from him? Why DID she want him? These are 
questions she had no answers for and frankly, these nagging thoughts 
annoyed her. She had to come to a solution fast or she would drive 
herself nuts over it!

She threw herself on the bed with a tired groan and closed her eyes. She 
waited for sleep to take her and was about to slip into deep slumber 
when her cell phone rang. She ignored it for a moment, willing the 
ringer to stop-- but the damn thing continued ring. She rolled over, 
grabbed the offending object and was about to punch a button to turn it 
off when she noticed who it that was calling, the name flashing clearly 
on the phone&#39;s glowing LCD.

With another groan, she answered the phone. &quot;You better have a damn good 
reason to call me up this late, Ami-chan...&quot;

&quot;Late? It&#39;s only 9 o&#39; clock Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako rolled her eyes. She had been partying non-stop SINCE last night. 
But she didn&#39;t want to tell her overprotective best friend and have her 
fret over her. &quot;Yeah whatever... I had a long day, that&#39;s why. So what&#39;s 
up?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; The voice on the other line was bashful which caused the blonde 
to perk up in curiosity. &quot;I met someone.&quot;

&quot;Whaaaaaaaaaat!&quot; Minako squealed and rolled on to her back in giddy 
surprise. &quot;You dawg! You have a boyfriend now? Why didn&#39;t you tell me 
sooner? Is he hot? What&#39;s his name? I better meet him first before I 
deem him worthy enough for your affections, Ami-chan!&quot;

&quot;Mina-chan...&quot; Ami&#39;s laughter echoed against her ear. &quot;It&#39;s not a 
boyfriend. It&#39;s um... I met a new friend, that&#39;s all.&quot;

&quot;A friend, eh?&quot; Minako repeated slyly, not convinced in the least. There 
was just something in her friend&#39;s voice that implied at something 
deeper. &quot;Are you sure? Maaaaybe you have a crush on this friend...&quot;

Silence.

&#39;Bingo.&#39; The blonde smirked. &quot;C&#39;mon! What&#39;s his name?&#39;

&quot;It&#39;s um...&quot; There was a long pause before Ami continued shyly, &quot;it&#39;s 
Makoto-san...&quot;

Minako felt faint and nearly dropped the phone. &quot;W-what?&quot;

&quot;I said her name is Makoto-san.&quot;

&#39;Her?&#39; She thought, expelling a breath in relief. The insinuation of her 
best friend&#39;s crush&#39;s gender did not even register in her tired brain. 
What was wrong with her? Makoto is such a common name... Why did she 
have to practically swoon like a school girl with a crush when someone 
else mentions it? She was disgusted with herself.

&quot;Is everything alright over there, Mina-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah... I... Look, I think I&#39;m more tired than I thought. Maybe 
we could continue this conversation some other time?&quot;

&quot;Of course, Mina-chan. I shouldn&#39;t keep you up.&quot;

&quot;I love ya, Ami-babe!&quot;

&quot;Love you too, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako hung up and groaned into her pillow.

+Author&#39;s Note+

What have I done to Ami-chan! (wails) I am too cruel! Shame on me! Shame 
on me! I hate myself for writing this part... But it was necessary! TT 
The things I must sacrifice for the good of the story... Ami-chaaaaaaan! 
Forgive meeeeeeeeeeeee! (wails again)

Ignore me... I lack sleep...

Ahem...

The &quot;-yaro&quot; suffix means that you&#39;re calling someone a bastard.

Kami means god. Mugen Gakuen roughly translates as Infinite Academy.</pre>
