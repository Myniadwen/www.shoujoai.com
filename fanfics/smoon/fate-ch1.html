<h1>It Must Have Been Fate</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;We&#39;re both girls, but it&#39;s strange. It must have been fate that we 
met.&quot;

Moments after you&#39;re gone, those words still repeat in my mind.

Fate...

It&#39;s so very cruel. I met you, became attached to you, and now I&#39;ve 
lost you...

Yes, you did sacrifice yourself to save me, but the fact remains that 
you&#39;re gone. And I&#39;m left with this sad emptiness, knowing 
probably never see you again.

My best friend...no...this feeling is stronger than just friendship.

{&quot;It must have been fate that we met...&quot;}

Fate...

Just like my mother and father, destined to be together...fate brought 
them together...

Hotaru-chan...you were more than just a friend.

{&quot;It&#39;s good we met. I&#39;m glad we became friends, Chibi-Usa-chan. 
Thank you. Goodbye.&quot;}

No, Hotaru-chan. Thank you.

You gave your life up to give me back mine. You just wanted to save 
me...

More than just a friend.

And now that I&#39;ve realized, it&#39;s too late. You&#39;re gone...

Hotaru-chan...

                ~

    The solemn pink-haired girl looked down at her brooch, her 
crimson eyes filling with tears.

    &#39;Aishiteru, Hotaru-chan,&#39; she thought as her tears began to 
fall.

                ~End~
