<p><strong>The  heir to the thrones of Uranus and Neptune has returned…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Open  the gates!”</p>
<p>“Kaiya!”</p>
<p>“Sis!”</p>
<p>A dark haired figure ran forward and embraced the other girl.</p>
<p>“I  missed you.” Both of them cried in each other’s arms.</p>
<p>“…I  missed you too.”<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Council of Planetary  Rulers and the Queen of Crystal Tokyo unanimously ruled that all  first born heirs of each royal family to report for training on  Crystal Tokyo under the guidance of Sailor Pluto, the guardian of  time.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To meet each other…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“My name is Kino  Kiyoshi. I am the heir to the thrones of Mercury and Jupiter. It is a  pleasure to make your acquaintance miss…?”</p>
<p><strong>Kino  Kiyoshi, a quiet girl with long chestnut colored hair that was kept  up in a bun and had sparkling blue eyes.</strong></p>
<p>“Tenoh Kaiya. I  am the heir to the thrones of Uranus and Neptune. It is also a  pleasure to make your acquaintance.”</p>
<p>“Never mind her!”  Someone pushed the other girl away. “I’m just glad that there’s  someone else who’s decently ‘normal’ around here. I’m the  heir to the throne of Venus and Mars, Hino Nozomi. Nice to meet ya!”  She extended her hand and grinned.</p>
<p><strong>Hino Nozomi, an  impulsive girl with long dark brown hair and amethyst eyes. Is she  who she really says she is?</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Normal?”</p>
<p>“You  know, someone who had a mother and an actual father. Not some woman  substitute.”</p>
<p>The room temperature suddenly dropped. Kaiya  walked past the extended hand without meeting the girl’s gaze and  said, “Sorry, both of my parents are female. You’re on your own  there.” She walked up to the other woman who had been pushed away  and gave the shorter girl a warm smile. “It was Kiyoshi wasn’t  it?”</p>
<p><strong>To awaken their powers…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>TUP!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Nozomi  dashed forward with her eyes full of anger. “Who said that you’re  our leader?” She demanded.</p>
<p>“No one did.” Kaiya replied  in a flat tone as she jumped back from the attack.</p>
<p>“Then  what ARE you saying?”</p>
<p>“I’m saying that you’re not  thinking straight and are attacking in a blind rage.  World…SHAKING!”</p>
<p><strong><em>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR-KABLAM!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><strong>To  learn their duty…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>Pluto hit her garnet rod’s hilt on  the tiled cement floor. “All the planet rulers are on Pluto and are  currently holding back the negative force. You will all be in charge  of your respective planets and are to keep the order among your  people amidst the current chaos until we can formulate a way to  defeat our foe.”</p>
<p>“What? BUT THEY’RE JUST KIDS!” A  servant cried out.</p>
<p>“Speak for yourself.” Nozomi huffed.  “But you might have to worry about the young ‘uns over there.”  She jerked a finger at Kaiya and Kiyoshi.</p>
<p>“Silence!”  Pluto commanded.</p>
<p><strong>Where some must regain the respect of  their people…</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><u>In the palace of Uranus</u></p>
<p>Kaiya  seized the general and army commander’s collar. “I SAID get them  out of there! I will not have my men left to die in a meaningless  battle!”</p>
<p>“B-But your majesty! Who will defend our planet  from their army if not the troops? There are practically at our  doorstep!”</p>
<p>“I said. Pull. Them. Out!” She released him  from her grip and began to walk out of the throne room.</p>
<p>“Are  you going to surrender?” He called out desperately. He knew it, he  shouldn’t have trusted this…this…</p>
<p>Kaiya stopped mid-step  and turned at the doorway, looking extremely angry. “We will <u>not</u> surrender! <strong>I</strong> WILL DEFEND THIS PLANET!”</p>
<p><strong>Where they  all willmeet on the battlefield…</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Plip.  Plip.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Hah…hah…” Kaiya gripped harder onto her  spear, the chains circling above and posed to strike at the army of  mortal men. It had been an hour since she had entered combat. Only  recently had her helmet had been knocked off, showing the visible  perspiration streaming down the sides of her face. Blood stained her  blue and gold armor. If she were not the heir and had the powers she  did, many would have mistaken the girl to be a regular  soldier.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter? Your army won’t fight for  you?” Amethyst eyes glared back at her, taunting her  opponent.</p>
<p>“It’s not their battle! This should only be  between you and me! We shouldn’t be fighting anyway! Wha-What are  you thinking Nozomi?”</p>
<p>“My orders.”</p>
<p><strong>TWEEEET!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>“Line  up men!”</p>
<p>Kaiya spun around to see Uranus and Neptune  soldiers marching up in rows. The sight was truly something to  behold. They all wore similar armor to Kaiya’s and each carried a  spear, facing skyward as they were being lead by the general she had  berated only a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”  She demanded.</p>
<p>“Fighting for our planet and…for our leader.  We will not let you fight this alone, regardless of your orders my  majesty!” The middle-aged man gave a deep bow.</p>
<p>“Neither  will we leave a comrade in need.” A quiet voice echoed through the  battlefield.</p>
<p>“Kiyoshi?” Kaiya turned to see the quiet heir  as they walked onto the battlefield, adorned in battle armor as well.  She was followed by a large mass of Mercury and Jupiter’s  soldiers.</p>
<p>“Allies?”</p>
<p>“They actually came?” A few  of Kaiya’s soldiers muttered.</p>
<p>“Will you let us help?”  Kiyoshi extended her hand out to the blood-covered heir of Uranus and  Neptune.</p>
<p><em>You guys…</em>Kaiya’s hands shook at her  sides. <em>Everyone…</em> “Of course!” Instead of the handshake  Kaiya thought it would be Kiyoshi instead gave her a warm hug.  Soldiers from both sides cheered for their leaders and their new  united front.</p>
<p>“RAAAAAAAAAH! RAAAAAAAAAH!” They cried. Many  had begun to pound the hilts of their spears into the ground,  heightening the tension of the already tense atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong><em>Thud!  Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!  Thud!</em></strong></p>
<p>“Looks like the crybaby decided to come out of  hiding and fight after all.” Nozomi muttered with an amused  expression.</p>
<p><strong>Until it comes down to the end…Fate,  destiny, will one choose their future or does the future already have  something in store for them all…?</strong></p>
<p><em>Until we meet  again…</em></p>
<p>“It’s the King and Queen!”</p>
<p><em>I’m  sure…we’ll meet her again someday.</em></p>
<p><strong>DOOOOOM</strong></p>
