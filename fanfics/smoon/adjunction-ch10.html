<p><em>The  end result? Makoto and Ami came in all cheers to see Minako  half-pinning and half-lying-on-top-of Rei.</em></p>
<p><em>“Oh-ho...  looks like the party's already started huh? And to think you're  alcohol free now too...!”</em></p>
<p><em>But Rei had  once again blocked out the world. Minako's long hair framed her face,  providing a shroud of darkness, preventing others from seeing how  their eyes met, their lips parted, dreams flashing before them in a  flurry of desire...</em></p>
<p>Rei  could feel the blood flooding her face.</p>
<p>Minako,  for all her experience, kept hers just a tad over a light blush, but  as if to compensate, her eyes smoldered with something... far deeper,  far more intense, than just a blush.</p>
<p>“Uh,  guys?”</p>
<p>It  was indeterminable who truly snapped out of it first, but being on  top, Minako hurriedly rolled over and away once she did, mumbling a  small apology that only Rei could really catch. She sat up and faced  the other way, mumbling in turn that no need, it was her fault, too.</p>
<p>They  noticed how quiet it was. They looked around.</p>
<p>Mako  and Usagi were giving them knowing looks, while Ami was trying to  busy herself by setting out more cups.</p>
<p>“W-what!”  Rei spluttered, unable to do anything else. She looked at Usagi.  And then made a mad dash to try to clear up and put away her  collection.</p>
<p>Which,  of course, snapped Usagi back into action as she openly protested,  “Hey! I wanted to show Mako-chan too! What are you doing!”</p>
<p>Which,  of course, got Mako-chan interested, not having noticed the messy  sprawl of things near the closet from her position at the door. She  eagerly rushed into the fray.</p>
<p>Which,  of course, in turn caused Rei to get even more  defensive, acting like she just wanted to gather it all up and throw  it away, when she was really thinking along the lines of, <em>If they  mess with it this much the merchandise is going to get damaged!  Hands off, Usa!</em></p>
<p>The amusing thing  is, Minako wasn't sure what to do, held idle as she watched the trio.   Her first instinct was to hold Rei back so the others could  peaceably get at the collection- which she, too, wanted to see, but  after what just happened, the very thought of being next to the  priestess was embarrassing.</p>
<p>The great Minako  Aino, embarrassed into a state of immobility? Surely not!</p>
<p>Which naturally  meant, that was exactly the case at hand.</p>
<p>When Usagi tried  to grab her most favorite piece of all, a thankfully-unlabeled tape  of Minako's Christmas photo shoot (that she had confiscated from a  certain perverted cop...), Rei had had it. Slapping her hands on the  tatami mat (absently careful not to smash any merchandise still lying  around) she declared, “Enough! Leave my stuff alone!”</p>
<p>Usagi  unconsciously yelped and retracted her hands to her chest as if  bitten. She pouted at Rei. Makoto was also wondering if they had  gone too far, but understandably backed off.</p>
<p>Rei sighed,  realizing that might have been a bit much. She mumbled as a way of  apology as she put the things casually into the box, “I'll let you  look at it later, if you promise to be careful with it.”</p>
<p>Which instantly  perked Usagi up as she agreed. Minako smiled a little at Rei's  surrender to the princess of their circle. Few could stand seeing  Usagi sad- though this was more of a matter of whiny-Usagi vs.  impatient-Usagi... which was questionably different. It should be,  at least. Subtly.</p>
<p>Mako-chan, as way  of distraction, raised her voice to herd everyone back to the table  for a toast. Makoto declared as they all held their cups up-  traditional tea cups (I don't think they're called cups... but you  know what I mean) filled with the alcoholic blend of sake and  something stronger, “Here's to Minako's successful return to  Japan!”</p>
<p>Which led to  everyone chiming in afterwards with, “Bonzai! (I dunno... Kanpai?  Cheers? Whatever...)”</p>
<p>After they all took the first  bittersweet gulp, Ami asked, having realized that what happened  between her and Mako would be ignored provided the incident between  Minako and Rei was similarly ignored, “So Minako-chan... how long  will you be here, again?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled a little, memories of  her first night back returning to her. She took another gulp. “It's  tentative at a week, but if circumstances change, I might stay  longer.”</p>
<p>Rei's eyes widened in alarm. Usagi  voiced her thoughts. “Only a week! Why? You're back again- why  do you have to leave so soon!”</p>
<p>Minako gave her a patient smile as  another sip-type-gulp brought the idol and the alcohol together  again. “My manager wants to see how well I'll do in America,  considering how well known I already am in Europe.”</p>
<p>It came out before Rei could stop it.  She growled, “Then why did you bother coming back here at all!”</p>
<p>Stunned by the harshness of her words,  as the other ex-Senshi felt that any time with Minako was fine,  especially after so long, the others watched in silence for Minako's  answer.</p>
<p>Minako sighed, turning towards Rei.  “Didn't I say it was tentative? Having a private jet means there's  no problem really if I <em>don't</em> go on time.”</p>
<p>Rei was silent,  though the three other heads had turned to her as if passively  watching a tennis match. Eventually, she answered the serve. “Then  don't. Don't go.”</p>
<p>Minako shook her  head. “If nothing's here to hold me down, I'm not allowed to  stay.”</p>
<p>Usagi intervened,  “Can't you stay for us? For your fans in Japan?”</p>
<p>Minako suddenly  felt very fatigued. She set her cup down. “My fanbase, according  to the website, currently stretches across the globe. I have no more  professional obligation to this country as I do to any other.”</p>
<p>Rei's fists shook  as she fought to keep from reaching forward and shaking the idol.  Then, limply, she let them unravel. “Is that all your home country  means to you anymore? Just another place where you have fans?”</p>
<p>Minako stood up,  too suddenly to stop a head rush, but she ignored it. With a simple,  “I have to use the restroom,” she excused herself from their  company.</p>
<p>It got quiet.</p>
<p>In a very obvious  sort of way.</p>
<p>Usagi stage  whispered, “Rei-chan, are you okay?”</p>
<p>Rei glared at her,  and brought the drink to her lips.</p>
<p>Lips that only  this morning had touched the idol's.</p>
<p>She let the cup  collide with the table, stable only because of her death grip on it  the whole way down. Rei sighed.</p>
<p>In an attempt to  change the subject, Rei asked, “Ami-chan, did anything interesting  happen at work lately?”</p>
<p>Ami was a little  jarred by the change of pace, but recovered fairly well. “Ah, mm,  well... oh! Since we were a little understaffed at the time do to  sick-calls and everything, I helped deliver a baby earlier today.”</p>
<p>“Really! That's  so cool! Was it a boy or a girl?” Usagi obligingly helped changed  the course of discussion.</p>
<p>As Ami got into  it, Minako leaned against the hallway wall, the door separating her  from the others still closed.</p>
<p>It was too much.  Was the Goddess of Love really reaching out for her now? When up  until now, all that had come of it were impossible dreams?</p>
<p>She sank down to  the floor, folding her arms over her knees. Why was it all happening <em>now</em>? All accidents, to be sure, but it was wrong... so  wrong... to think that Rei might feel the same... that she wasn't  imagining that look in her eyes... most likely just a reflection of  her own.</p>
<p>Minako stopped.  Did Rei know? Know how she felt about her best friend?</p>
<p>Her head fell to  rest on her arms, thinking about all the instances that had occurred  since her arrival.</p>
<p>Rei waiting for  her, knowing she'd look there if nowhere else.</p>
<p>Rei welcoming her  back, with that sweet smile.</p>
<p>Rei buying her  favorite tea for her, even though she personally hated that kind.</p>
<p>Rei accidentally  picking out lingerie instead of innocent sleepwear.</p>
<p>Rei falling asleep  in the middle of the two futons, also foregoing the chance to see  Minako walk in wearing aforementioned sleepwear.</p>
<p>Sleeping next to  Rei, curled into a possessive half-embrace...</p>
<p>Breathing in her  scent... breathing her breaths... watching her angelic sleeping  face...</p>
<p>Dreaming and yet  not dreaming of a similar situation involving her...</p>
<p>Waking up to find  that Rei was panicking over being caught in bed with her...  oversleeping...</p>
<p>Watching just  barely enough without getting caught... watching Rei strip in front  of her...</p>
<p>Changing with the  realization that Rei was returning the gesture...</p>
<p>Sitting beside  Rei, touching her in concern, not noting her unfinished clothing  process...</p>
<p>Hearing her  student ask if they were lovers... and not helping wish that she  could say 'yes'...</p>
<p>Letting slip on  the radio that her mind was occupied by a certain someone... in the  next room...</p>
<p>Rei slamming her  head up just in time to catch her in a chaste kiss... one that  blissfully stung for a few moments...</p>
<p>Rei teaming up  with her to tease Makoto and Usagi... taking her side against Usagi's  wishes...</p>
<p>Usagi insinuating  that the love between them was obvious and yet they were too dense to  notice...</p>
<p>And that moment,  when Minako had fallen over Rei and was in position to...</p>
<p>Behind the curtain  of solitude, Minako allowed herself a moment to fully blush to  compensate for all the times it didn't reach the surface.</p>
<p>“Rei...”  Minako leaned her head against the wall, thunked it for bad measure,  and stood up. This was no way for an idol to be behaving. Taking a  deep breath, she returned to the others, not the least bit better for  wear than when she had left.</p>
<p>--OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO--</p>
<p>As the night wore  on, there were the good points, and the bad points, the details of  which can only be left to an outsider's imagination.</p>
<p>Makoto and Ami <em>did</em> succeed in producing a drunk Usagi. They did not foresee that doing  so would produce a... (cough) a not so innocent princess.</p>
<p>Dealing with the  problems of the aforementioned drunk persona conveniently convinced  Minako and Rei that good efforts were to be rewarded by getting drunk  themselves.</p>
<p>The 'getting  drunk' part had not actually been their focus. They happened to be  considering the 'reward' end of the bargain.</p>
<p>While Makoto made  sure they all stayed inside, early on, Ami went out for a few more  bottles, just to clinch the deal, as well as some useful hangover  combinations and food that wasn't entirely unhealthy.</p>
<p>Once it was clear  that no one had intentions of driving home that night (it was already  approaching midnight by then), rooms were assigned, more drinks were  had, more frisky actions were done, a few judo moves executed, a  handful of restraining pile-ups... and let's just say, by the end of  the night, the bathroom was used far more than once, for far more  than one purpose.</p>
<p>Rei, in hindsight,  would have probably been very grateful that they received no midnight  callers in person or on the phone. Her reputation would have surely  been shot down and mobbed.</p>
<p>For more than one  purpose, again.</p>
<p>Moving on...</p>
<p>Usagi, in  remembrance of her kicking power when under the stupor of 'sleep',  was hauled into a room all by her lonesome, though Rei grudgingly  gave up one of her lesser Minako-chan dolls to keep the princess  company. Lesser meaning it was easily washable if she had it  returned to her with slumber slobber.</p>
<p>An hour or two  after that, Makoto and Ami helped move the table over to some  inconspicuous area so Rei and Minako's futons could be set next to  each other.</p>
<p>Followed by Makoto  and Ami wandering off to their own assigned room to sleep off the  effects of the party.</p>
<p>Which left the  last few sips and chips to go to the Love and Passion duo, afore they  fell down against each other, slowly sinking down to the sheets...</p>
