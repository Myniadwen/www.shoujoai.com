<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 6 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><pre>Five girls laughed among themselves, sitting at the back booth of the 
Crown Parlour. And three cats sat between them, their stiffled giggles 
drfting into the mass of laughter.

Makoto sat next to Minako, her arm wrapped around the blonde. Rei sat 
next to Minako, Luna in her lap. Next to her were Artemis and Ace, 
then Usagi. AndM lastly, Ami who was sitting across from Makoto on the 
other side of the rounded booth. 

They had ended up here instead of Rei&#39;s temple for their meeting, but 
no one knew why. Maybe it was because it was too nice a day to stay at 
Rei&#39;s temple. Or maybe it was the free shakes Motoki would always 
supply them with. 

The afternoon wore on, and the sun began to set behind the clouds. 
Usagi streched and excused herself to go home. Ace had nearly been 
mauled by Luna when he told the group that he had given Mamoru&#39;s 
memory back, but Usagi was able to defend him.

Rei was next to leave, followed by the three cats. Luna, of course, 
went home. Artemis and Ace, however, went to town to find a few cute 
kittens to tease for a while. 

Makoto and Minako stood to leave. Minako walked over to pay the groups 
bill for food that day as Makoto sat back down and waited. She glanced 
out the corner of her eye and saw Ami staring at the table.

&quot;The table says stop staring. Its very rude, ya know.&quot;

Ami blinked and looked up at Makoto and blushed, looking back down.

&quot;You alright, Ami-chan? You haven&#39;t said two words to me these past 
few days. Not that you ever do in the first plac, but I feel like 
something&#39;s different now. Everything alright?&quot;

Ami nodded slowly.

Makoto nodded in response. &quot;Would you like a ride home, Ami?&quot;

&quot;Iie, thank you. I think I should walk home.&quot; At that, Ami stood and 
walked away from the table. As she walked past Makoto, the amazon took 
hold of her wrist gently and pulled her closer.

&quot;Ami...&quot;

&quot;I have to go, Makoto-san.&quot;

Makoto sighed and stood, releasing Ami&#39;s arm. But before Ami had taken 
two steps from her, Makoto said, just loud enough for her and Ami to 
hear, &quot;I remember, Ami.&quot;

Ami stopped and slowly turned back to look at Makoto.

&quot;And I know you do, too.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

Ami walked thru her bedroom door, shut it, walked to her bed and fell 
face first on to it. And somewhere in the process of that, she had 
removed her shirt, pants and socks and laid on her bed in only her 
panties and bra.

She stared out in front of her, tears welling up in her eyes then 
slowly spilling over. Ami turned her head and buried her face in her 
comforter, slowly crying herself to sleep.

~Alone for a while 
I&#39;ve been searching through the dark, 
For traces of the love you left inside my lonely heart. 
To weave by picking up the pieces that remain. 
Melodies of Life - Love&#39;s lost refrain~

&quot;Ami-chan...&quot;

The blue haired girl groaned and pulled the blanket over her head.

&quot;Go...a....way....&quot;

Ami heard a soft giggle. &quot;Newp, can&#39;t do that.&quot;

&quot;Why not? I&#39;m tired!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re such a baby! Come ON! The new senshi is suppossed to arrive 
today and my mom wants us there!&quot; 

Ami ignored the person talking to her until she felt her bed move then 
someone sitting on her side bouncing up and down.

&quot;AMI-CHAN!&quot;

&quot;ALRIGHT! GET OFFA ME, SERENITY!!! YOU&#39;RE HEAVY!&quot; Ami sat up quickly, 
making the young Moon princess fall onto the edge of the bed in a fit 
of giggles.

&quot;You&#39;re such a grouch in the morning, Ami-chan.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;re annoying.&quot; The eight year old Princess of Mercury climbed 
out of bed and stretched. &quot;After her, how many others do we need?&quot;

&quot;Just one,&quot; Serenity answered. &quot;Minako, Princess of Venus.&quot;

&quot;I heard that Jupiter was older than us. How much older is she?&quot;

Serenity thought for a moment. &quot;Well, she&#39;s fourteeen. Thats what, six 
years? Give or take a month.&quot;

Ami nodded and headed for her closet to change. &quot;She&#39;s been training 
longer than us, hasn&#39;t she?&quot;

&quot;Hai, she has. And I hear she&#39;s very well trained at that. She ranks 
well with Mother&#39;s gaurdians, and you know who they are.&quot;

Ami poked her head out of her head, her eyes wide. &quot;She ranks with the 
outers!?&quot; Serenity nodded. &quot;Oh my...&quot; Ami sank back inside the closet 
to finish getting ready.

Ami and Serenity walked the halls of the Moon Palace in silence. They 
stopped at a room and five minutes later another eight year old came 
out.

&quot;Hey, Rei,&quot; Ami and Serenity said at the same time.

Rei smiled and nodded at them as the three began to walk. &quot;Hey 
yourselves. Where&#39;s this new senshi? I wanna meet her!&quot;

&quot;She arrived early this morning,&quot; Serenity said.

&quot;This morning,&quot; Ami asked. &quot;I thought you said she wouldn&#39;t get here 
till later?&quot;

&quot;Thats what I thought. But Luna came in and told me while you were 
getting dressed. She&#39;s in the training room right now.&quot;

&quot;So, can we go there,&quot; Rei asked.

&quot;You just want to spar with her don&#39;t you,&quot; Ami asked.

Rei nodded. &quot;HAI!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d want to, Rei,&quot; the moon princess said calmly. 
&quot;Her abilities match with those of the outer senshi, Mother said. 
She&#39;d hurt you.&quot;

&quot;Nah...&quot;

&quot;At least watch her fight first, Rei,&quot; Ami said. &quot;That way you&#39;d know 
if you could take her.&quot;

Rei sighed and nodded as they stopped in front of the training room&#39;s 
door. &quot;Alright, alright.&quot;

The girls cracked the door open and peeked inside, hearing battle 
cries coming from several people. They saw the head general of the 
Moon Kingdom&#39;s army being backed into a wall by a girl with long brown 
hair, pulled up into a pony tail.

The girls slowly walked into the room and sat on the sidelines 
watching as the girl took out the general and other highly ranked 
members of the army until only she stood on the mat.

The girl, for her age, was quite tall and muscular. Her skin was 
tanned a light brown and was now glistening with sweat.

The girl turned around hen she heard soft giggling and clapping. She 
smiled and bowed to her audiance of the three princesses and Ami 
blushed when her blues met with the girl&#39;s green ones...

~Our paths they did cross, 
Though I cannot say just why, 
We met, we laughed, we held on fast, 
And then we said goodbye, 
And who&#39;ll hear the echoes of stories never told? 
Let them ring out loud until they unfold. 
In my dearest memories, I see you reaching out to me. 
Though you&#39;re gone, 
I still believe that you can call out my name~

------------------------------------------------------------

&quot;Come on, Mako-chan! You promised!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t feel like it, Ami.&quot;

&quot;But..you promised!&quot;

Makoto couldn&#39;t help but laugh. She and the princess of Mercury were 
secluded away from the others near a small pond in the Moon Garden. 
Makoto was leaning against a tree a book in her hand. Ami, on the 
other hand, had changed from her royal gowns to a simple bathing suit 
and was waiting for Makoto to join her.

&quot;I promised to come out here with you,&quot; Makoto said calmly. I didn&#39;t 
say I&#39;d go swimming.&quot;

Ami narrowed her eyes, snatched Makoto&#39;s book from her hands and sat 
in the older girl&#39;s lap. It had been six years since they had met and 
a year or so since they had been an official couple.

Wrapping her arms around Makoto&#39;s neck, Ami pouted slightly. &quot;Don&#39;t 
you love me any more?&quot;

Makoto laughed and shook her head. &quot;Nope, I don&#39;t. Now give me my book 
back.&quot;

Ami blinked, growled at Makoto and stood up and threw her book at her. 
&quot;Fine!&quot; She then turned and stormed out to the pond and walked into 
the water and sat at a spot where the water came up to her collar 
bone.

Makoto sat there and blinked. She had been kidding when she said she 
didn&#39;t love Ami any more. She sat her book down and stood and stripped 
out of her pants and shirt, revealing her own bathing suit.

Makoto walked into the water behind Ami, sat down behind her and 
wrapped her arms around the girl&#39;s shoulders. Ami tried to pull away 
but Makoto only held on tighter.

&quot;I was joking, Ami-chan. You know that.&quot;

&quot;I know..&quot;

&quot;Something&#39;s on your mind, isn&#39;t it?&quot; 

Ami nodded and Makoto rested her chin on Ami&#39;s shoulder. 

&quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

&quot;You...love me, right?&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

&quot;And you want to be with me forever, right?&quot;

Makoto sighed. She knew exactly where this was heading. 
&quot;Ami-chan...Ilove you dearly. But us being senshi, we have to put the 
Princess&#39;s happiness before our own. You know that right?&quot;

Ami nodded slowly, holding in her tears.

Makoto pulled Ami closer and kissed her shoulder then pressed her 
cheek agaisnt Ami&#39;s head. 

&quot;If things were different, then yes, I would want to be with you 
forever. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna have a life we&#39;d both like to 
live. Not being who we are anyway.&quot;

&quot;Rei saw something in the fire,&quot; Ami said, wanting tochange the 
subject. &quot;She saw a battle coming towards the Moon soon.&quot;

&quot;If that happens,&quot; Makoto said standing. &quot;Then we&#39;ll fight. Come on, 
its gonna rain soon.&quot;

Ami turned and looked up at Makoto confused. &quot;How do you know?&quot;

No sooner had she asked did lightening crack in the distance. Ami 
looked up at Makoto who only smiled.

&quot;I just know.&quot;

~A voice from the past, 
Joining yours and mine. 
Adding up the layers of harmony. 
And so it goes, on and on. 
Melodies of Life. 
To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and beyond~

&quot;Hey, Rei? Whats been up with Makoto and Ami lately,&quot; Minako asked. 

&quot;You didn&#39;t hear,&quot; Serenity asked.

Minako shook her head. She had only been with the senshi a couple of 
months, but was already very close to the group.

&quot;They broke up and called their engagment off,&quot; Serenity said. &quot;Makoto 
told Ami she didn&#39;t love her any more.&quot;

Minako blinked. &quot;Why did she do that?&quot;

&quot;She loves someone else,&quot; Rei said. &quot;But I don&#39;t know who.&quot;

&quot;How&#39;d Ami take it?&quot;

&quot;Oh she took it bad,&quot; Serenity said. &quot;Its been almost two weeks and 
she refuses to speak to any one. I don&#39;t even think she&#39;s been eating 
much if at all.&quot;

Minako nodded and stood to leave. 

&quot;Where are you going,&quot; Serenity asked.

&quot;I&#39;m gonna go check on her. I&#39;ll be right back.&quot; Minako then walked 
outside into the corridor and headed for Ami&#39;s room. When she got 
there, she knocked softly.

&quot;Go away!&quot;

&quot;Ami-chan,&quot; Minako said quietly. &quot;Its me, Minako. Can I please cme in? 
I&#39;m worried about you.&quot;

At first, Minako heard nothing, then she heard a quiet , &quot;alright,&quot; 
come from Ami&#39;s room. Queitly, Minako opened the door, walked inside 
and shut it behind her.

The room was dark, but enough light was shining in from the window for 
Minako to see. Serenity had been right. She wasn&#39;t eating. The meals 
from that day had yet to be touched. Ami herself sat in a large arm 
chair, her legs up to her chest and was staring out the window. 

Minako walked over to Ami and asked, &quot;I heard what happend. Are you 
ok?&quot;

Silence at first, then Ami turned her face to Minako. A wild, 
animalistic look in her eyes. &quot;I hate you.&quot;

Minako blinked and took a step back. &quot;Why? What did I do?&quot;

&quot;She left me because of you,&quot; Ami said, not loosing the killing glare 
towards Minako as she stood from her chair and began to slowly walk 
towards Minako. Minako blinked and backed away slowly from Ami.

&quot;What are you talking about?&quot;

&quot;She left because of YOU! She loves YOU more than ME! I HATE YOU!&quot;

~So far and away, 
See the birds as it flies by, 
Gliding through the shadows of the clouds up on the sky
I&#39;ve laid my memories, and dreams upon those wings. 
Leave them now and see what tomorrow brings. 
In your dearest memories, do you remember loving me? 
Was it fate that brought us close and now leaves us behind~

Minako left Ami&#39;s room quickly and headed for the library, knowing 
Makoto would be there. She searched the giant library, and after 
minutes of searching, found Makoto sitting in a window seat readin a 
book.

Minako stormed over to Makoto and slapped the book out of her hand. 
Makoto, surprised by being assulted looked up at Minako.

&quot;There are better ways of getting my attention, ya know.&quot;

Minako had tears in her eyes. &quot;Why did you leave her? She loves you!&quot;

Makoto blinked then shook her head. &quot;Its none of your business. But 
since you asked,&quot; Makoto jumped up from her seat so quickly, she had 
Minako pinned between her and a large shelf of books within seconds. 
Minako blinked and swallowed hard.

Moments passed in silence until Minako found her voice. &quot;Are you gonna 
answer me or just stand there?&quot; Her voice was cold, but she wanted to 
know if what Ami said was true. Minako had a deep crush on Makoto 
since the day they met.

Makoto&#39;s eyes softened and she leaned forward and gently kissed 
Minako, who eagerly returned it.

~A voice from the past, 
Joining yours and mine. 
Adding up the layers of harmony, and so it goes, on and on.
Melodies of Life. 
To the sky beyond the flying birds - forever and beyond~

------------------------------------------------------------

Ami opened her eyes, her body feeling cold. She sat up and looked down 
at herself, realizing she had forgotten to put on clothes when fell 
asleep.

She sat up and rubbed her eyes, her face still wet from tears. She 
glanced over at her clock and it read two in the morning. She sighed 
and got up from her bed and picked her pajamas from up off the floor 
and quickly put them on.

She turned back to her bed and was startled when she saw a tabby cat 
laying on her bed, sleeping. She looked at him then looked over at her 
desk and saw a small note. She turned her desk lamp on and read the 
note:

&quot;Ami-chan,

I saw him when I went out for lunch and bought him for you when I left 
for home. I hope you like him. He reminds me of a lion, so why not 
call him &#39;Leo&#39;? Love ya! 

Mom&quot;

Ami sighed then smiled as Leo continued to sleep. She turned her lamp 
out and climbed back into bed, being careful not to wake the cat up. 

As Ami closed her eyes, one thought flashed in her mind.

If Makoto knew about their past, would things now change?

~If I should leave this lonely world behind. 
Your voice will still remember our melody. 
Now I know we&#39;ll carry on. 
Melodies of Life. 
Come circle round and grow deep in our hearts,
As long as we remember~ </pre>
