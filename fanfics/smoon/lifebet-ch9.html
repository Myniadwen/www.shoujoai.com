<h1>Life Just Gets Better (part 9 of 11)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/lifebet-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>Again they were in the park. Setsuna with them to watch. Of course, 
Cathena in the sky with that same smirk.

&#147; Who will fight me this week? Only nine sailors left, choose wisely.&#148;

&#147; I&#146;ll fight and show you how strong our power is.&#148; Venus flew upward 
meeting her enemy.

&#147; Don&#146;t be cocky now.&#148; Venus quickly called for her sword and 
attacked. Determination in her eyes. Cathena dodged all attempts to 
slice her. Looking for and opening she kicked the Love Goddess in the 
stomach. Sending her downwards. Then called upon Pluto&#146;s powers she 
yelled &#147; Time spears&#148; and staked the falling Senshi to the ground. As 
Venus struggled, Cathena landed and stood over her. The others looked 
away. Not being able to bare watching what was going to happen.

&#147; No more Venus.&#148; Cathena&#146;s smirk was back. Then laughter when Venus 
screamed, her powers sucked into the staff. 

&#147; Until next week!&#148; Cathena disappeared. 

The others ran to her shaking form. Mina had never looked so 
miserable. Ami checked Mina over. Nothing was wrong except for a 
bruise on her stomach, and of course her powers were gone.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every week Cathena appeared to defeat yet another Senshi. She was 
constantly annoyed by the way they called her Terrestria. One by one 
each person was defeated. Losing their powers and being pure human. 
After Setsuna &amp; Mina, Amara lost first. Then Michelle followed by 
Darien, Serena, Ami, Lita, &amp; Hotaru. Surprisingly the Death Senshi had 
done better than Sailor Moon, who lost after 10 minutes. Rei was the 
only Senshi left. She still didn&#146;t understand what Terri had told her. 
Well she didn&#146;t until the final battle.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A/N: Nope keep reading. It ain&#146;t over yet!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lord Dradian was very pleased with Cathena&#146;s work. So pleased that he 
came to see the demise of the last annoying sailor. He had no problem 
that she hadn&#146;t killed them. He could do it himself when he felt like 
it. So here they were, in a valley waiting for the battle to begin.

- One more, this is where it ends- Cathena&#146;s now trademark smirk was 
back in place. 

&#147; Ready to fight Mars?&#148;

&#147; You know I never understood what you told me before that basterd 
turned you against me. Terri, I understand now.&#148;

&#147; Stop calling me that! Are you depth? My name is Cathena!&#148;

&#147; NO! Your name is Terrestria!&#148; 

&#147; Keep calling me that and out fight will be your death!&#148; Cathena was 
royally pissed off now. The Fire Senshi&#146;s face softened and she walked 
toward her. 

&#147; Cathena kill her now! Do not listen to her lies!&#148; Dradian looked 
down as his warrior was frozen in place. 

&#147; Terrestria you came to Earth looking for your brother. You revived 
our memories. My memories.&#148;

&#147; Stop! Stay where you are. I am Cathena, Goddess of Corruption. My 
orders come from Lord Dradian!&#148; Cathena/Terri raised her arms ready 
for attack. Rei kept walking. When she was in front of Cathena/Terri, 
Rei pushed her arms done gently.

&#147; Terri I figured out the doors. Your sign is on mine. Do you know 
why?&#148; Cathena/Terri was frozen in place. Signs of the real Terri 
breaking through. Mars then moved backward.

&#147; It&#146;s because I love you.&#148; The other woman was shocked. Mars raised 
her hands to her chest. Concentrating she called her secret attack. &#147; 
Universal Flames Purify!&#148; Fire erupted from Mars and traveled around 
the stunned girl. The staff was destroyed. When the flames ended the 
person standing there was definitely Terri. Still in Cathena clothing, 
she ran and hugged Rei very tight.

&#147; I knew you&#146;d figure it out!&#148; The others came running before more 
could be said. Once again Terri waved her hand at them and the stones 
appeared. 

&#147; Here ya go guys! I&#146;m sure you missed these.&#148; After everyone 
transformed Terri thought she&#146;d never know oxygen again!

Dradian was furious. They had gotten back what he worked so hard to 
steal. 

&#147; Naraiah!&#148; She appeared before him in one of Cathena&#146;s suites only 
lavender. 

&#147; You called my Lord?&#148;

&#147; Yes, Naraiah if you wish to be Queen, prove yourself by killing 
Terrestria.&#148;

&#147; My pleasure Lord Dradian.&#148; As Naraiah went into battle, Dradian 
called out 60 youma for the others to fight.

- Can&#146;t have them interfering with one&#146;s death.- He smirked and 
watched the new battle. Naraiah was now in calling distance of the 
Sailor Senshi. 

&#147; Well Princess it&#146;s finally time for us to fight!&#148;

&#147; OK you twit!&#148; Terrestrial made sure her friends were ok, 
unfortunately they were fighting ugly youma. Again Terrestrial called 
her sword, as did the woman in front of her. Naraiah attacked and she 
ducked. Then tried to cut the lavender haired girl through the 
midsection. Naraiah knew this trick and quickly spun left. Bringing 
her sword up she almost cut into the sailor&#146;s arm. This went on for a 
hour. Just dodging energy blasts, swords, &amp; fists. By the end of the 
battle both had many deep cuts all over. Their suites were slashed in 
various places, it was amazing Naraiah&#146;s was still on!

&#147; Surrender now Princess, your death shall not be too painful.&#148; 

&#147; Surrender? I don&#146;t know the meaning!&#148;

A plan quickly formed in her head. Terrestrial charged and ducked 
again. She acted as if she were going for the midsection again, but 
teleported behind Naraiah when she spun. Before Naraiah could react to 
the Senshi behind her, there was a sword through her gut. Terrestrial 
pulled out her bloodied sword. Finally glad the fight was over. Her 
spine snapped and blood moving down her stomach, Naraiah could only 
stare and turn. She stared at Terrestrial as she dissolved like her 
youma. Terrestrial flew down to her friends, who were done slaying all 
the youma.

&#147; Still one more to beat guys. But he&#146;s all mine.&#148; 

Before anyone could stop her, Terri flew off to kill Dradian.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
