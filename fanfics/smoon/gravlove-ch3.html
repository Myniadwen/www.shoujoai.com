<h1>Gravity of Love (part 3 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Serena shifted in the chair uncomfortably. The woman had enough decency 
to cuff her to the foot of the bed as she sat instead of the painful 
position of having her arms behind her back. The moon was high in the 
sky, stars twinkling in the midnight velvet. Too bad the dirty window 
obstructed her view.

The kidnapper told her that she&#39;d be cuffed to the bed for the night 
while she slept. In the morning when she awoke, it&#39;ll be Serena&#39;s turn 
to sleep. Damn.

Serena gazed at the woman sleeping in bed, raven hair shimmering in the 
moonlight and framing the pale face. Long lashes brushed against her 
cheeks while crimson lips were parted. There was no smirk, no smug or 
dangerous expression on the pretty face. She was completely relaxed, 
completely at peace.

One would never think the woman would kidnap someone, much less be an 
assassin.

&#39;Rei.&#39;

It fit her somehow. The blonde didn&#39;t know why, but it just seemed to 
describe the woman perfectly. It was mysterious simple and a bit exotic. 
Now Serena wasn&#39;t saying the woman was simple, far from it. But...

&quot;Rei.&quot;

The name flowed like water from her lips.

No way, she couldn&#39;t think about her abductor in a positive way! 
Especially since she pretended to care about Mina-

Oh god! How would Minako feel when she found out the girl that she 
really likes abducted her cousin?! She pitied the blonde star, 
especially when her father finds out.

&quot;Thinking about Minako?&quot;

Serena looked up and eyed her kidnapper wearily. Violet eyes gazed at 
her as the slim woman sat up, her blanket pooling around her waist, 
revealing the baggy T-shirt she wore to bed.

The blonde nodded grimly, trying not to concentrate how the shirt made 
the woman look like a little girl. The raven-haired woman stood and 
walked over to her, causing Serena&#39;s heart to pound faster in fear.

Rei surprisingly took off the cuffs. The blonde stared at her in pure 
shock.

&quot;Well,&quot; the assassin growled impatiently. &quot;If you don&#39;t want to lie down 
on the bed, I&#39;ll recuf-&quot;

&quot;No!&quot; Serena exclaimed as she jumped onto the bed. Rei rolled her eyes 
at the hostage&#39;s antics before walking over and cuffing Serena&#39;s left 
wrist to the bar of the headboard.

&quot;What-&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t want you to escape.&quot;

The blonde sighed, looking at her clothes. &quot;Can I borrow something to 
wear, at least?&quot;

Rei sighed but relented and walked over to a large duffle. After a few 
minutes of digging, another large shirt appeared, which the assassin 
threw at Serena.

The blonde held up her cuffed hand, looking expectantly at Rei. The 
woman sighed and undid them, eyes narrowing slightly.

&quot;Hurry up.&quot;

Serena blushed and turned away from Rei, causing the mercenary to roll 
her eyes. Like the blonde had anything she hasn&#39;t seen before. When the 
hostage turned around again, the violet-eyed woman was more than ready 
to cuff her. What was wrong with her? Giving a hostage so much freedom. 
Bleh.

&quot;Mind if I use the bathroom?&quot;

With an annoyed growl, Rei gestured with her hand that she may, though 
her expression was one of completely frustration. The blonde gave her a 
hesitant but appreciative smile before hurrying into the bathroom. The 
assassin frowned and ran a hand through her silky mane. She must be 
really desperate for sleep or something.

Minutes later, Serena reemerged, causing Rei to do a double take. And 
here she thought Minako was beautiful. Well, the singer most definitely 
was, but a very different kind from the blonde before her. Minako was 
sexy, confident and drop dead gorgeous. Serena? She had the innocence 
about her that made her seem so cute, so pure and just so fluffy that 
she was absolutely... beautiful.

&quot;Tired?&quot;

Rei didn&#39;t even notice she yawned until the hostage spoke. She nodded 
grimly before cuffing Serena to the bed. The blonde pulled the blanket 
to her chin and tried to get comfortable,

The assassin laid back, her arms behind her head. She felt Serena&#39;s 
inquisitive gaze on her. After several minutes of the curious stare, she 
finally couldn&#39;t take it anymore.

&quot;Do you regret using Minako?&quot;

It wasn&#39;t a surprising question the blonde asked, but Rei was strangely 
taken aback. She turned her head away from the prisoner and looked out 
the window she had opened while Serena was in the bathroom.

&quot;Oh,&quot; Serena said, disappointed since she took the silence as a &#39;no.&#39;

&quot;I do, actually.&quot;

Blue eyes stared at the finger on the bed next to hers. Was the woman 
telling the truth?

&quot;In the beginning, it was just a plan to get to you.&quot;

Serena tried not to become infuriated by the confession, failing 
miserably. But valuing her life, she wisely remained quietly and waited 
for her abductor to continue.

&quot;But, as I began to know her, I became attracted to her. She&#39;s very 
beautiful... and very sexy...&quot;

Serena nodded sadly. Of course, her cousin, the breath-taking one. The 
star. The perfect one.

&quot;Of course, it&#39;s too late now.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Well, she knows I kidnapped you.&quot;

Hope swelled in the blonde. They knew it was Rei that did it! They could 
check out the boss of the car and get Rei&#39;s-

&#39;But that&#39;s it,&#39; Serena thought sadly. &#39;Mina-chan knows her as Rebecca, 
not Rei...&#39;

&quot;You&#39;re worried about her.&quot;

It was a statement and not a question, making the shorter woman wince. 
Despite being transparent to everyone, especially to an assassin, she 
was hoping not to reveal any vulnerability to the woman. But then again, 
Rei probably knew plenty about her.

&quot;Of course.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes softened as she gave the hostage a small but nonetheless 
reassuring smile.

&quot;They won&#39;t blame her for getting tricked, not once they find out who 
kidnapped you.&quot;

Serena&#39;s confusion must have been apparent, since the woman across from 
her chuckled.

&quot;Who... are you?&quot;

Silence. The chuckling stopped, sending a child shiver down the blonde&#39;s 
back. Rei rolled around again, looking at the moon before shaking her 
head. She scolded herself for caring. The blonde&#39;s already afraid of 
her, perhaps revealing her identity would get her to behave. Not that 
she was giving her too much trouble now. Actually, it was surprising how 
well Serena was cooperating, given the circumstances.

A smile touched her ruby lips. The only time the hostage acted up was 
the whole eating thing. As long as Rei stayed cold but not cruel, the 
girl would behave.

&quot;Rebe-Rei?&quot;

She spoke her name without fear, hesitation yes, but that was 
understandable. Why did she even tell Serena her real name? Frowning 
unconsciously, Rei couldn&#39;t help but feel as if this wasn&#39;t going to be 
like any other job.

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;Who are you?&quot;

&quot;Raven.&quot;

Serena felt her heart stop. Raven. THE Raven. Considered to be one of 
the most dangerous assassins in Japan. None of her target ever lives and 
none of her few hostages have ever been found alive. To be kidnapped by 
her was to know that you&#39;ll die, eventually. Part of Serena bitterly 
realized whoever hired the woman thought the blonde important enough to 
need such a high profile mercenary to get rid of.

Rei saw the fear in the cerulean eyes and the dread on the young face. 
So, she did know of her reputation. The assassin sat up, staring at the 
moon.

&quot;So, my future has already been decided.&quot;

Guilt flooded through the younger woman for a brief second. She 
suppressed it immediately. She was on the line as much as Serena, if not 
more. Guilt, or any other emotion for that matter, could be her 
downfall.

&quot;Not necessarily.&quot;

Serena&#39;s head shot up, so fast her neck hurt. Hope blazed in her bright 
eyes. Perhaps she could come out of this alive...

&quot;I don&#39;t know what my employer wants. So, patience is the only way to 
find out.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

The disappointment echoed in the low whisper. The assassin grunted and 
lay down.

&quot;Go to sleep,&quot; she growled harshly.

Serena nodded, though she knew her kidnapper couldn&#39;t see it, and did as 
she was told. Rei, Raven... was not one of mess with, especially since 
she held her life in her hands. The thought wasn&#39;t at all comforting.

 

 

 

~*~*~*~

The blonde awoke to the sun shining through the window. Serena groaned 
and looked around. Rei was no where to be seen. She didn&#39;t know whether 
to be happy or afraid. What if she was getting ready to kill her?

Just then, the bathroom door opened. Out stepped a very wet assassin. 
Serena smiled slightly at the sight. With a large towel wrapped around 
her hair and a relaxed expression, Rei looked like any other 20 year old 
and not a dangerous assassin. Okay, any other 20 year old with a body to 
die for.

Lavender eyes flickered over to her.

&quot;You&#39;re awake.&quot;

Serena&#39;s brows furrowed. She could hear the bait in the woman&#39;s voice. 
Time spent with Minako has made her an excellent detector of hidden 
baits.

&quot;You snore badly, Tsukino. I expected the mayor&#39;s daughter to be a well 
bred lady.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s cheeks flushed with embarrassment and anger as she glared 
indignantly at the wet woman.

The assassin chuckled and shook her head. Wordlessly, she walked over to 
her own bed. Serena&#39;s eyes widened as she pulled out two guns from under 
the mattress, expertly loading them before placing them on the bed 
again. Rei then put a leather holster on over her black tee. Lavender 
eyes caught the blonde&#39;s gaze and hardened. She placed the guns into the 
holsters and slipped a leather jacket onto her lean form.

&quot;Where are you going?&quot; Serena asked softly, her voice wavering.

&quot;To get some food.&quot;

Serena&#39;s stomach chose that exact second to growl loudly. Violet eyes 
twinkled faintly with amusement.

&quot;I take it you&#39;re hungry as well.&quot;

The blonde blushed as Rei walked out.

Blue eyes blinked. She was still cuffed to the bed!

~*~*~*~

Rei returned an hour later. When she opened the door, she found a pair 
of enraged eyes glaring at her in annoyance and impatience. With a 
smirk, the food was placed on the table.

&quot;Comfy?&quot;

She knew from experience not to tease her hostages. There was a scar on 
her back from a prisoner pushed to the edge. Of course, he didn&#39;t live 
long after that little incident. But with Serena, the urge to tease her 
was just too strong.

&quot;Shut up.&quot;

Rei&#39;s smirk widened. That was the first tie she&#39;s heard Miss Upper Class 
say anything remotely foul. Even when she first woke up and realized 
she&#39;d been kidnapped, she never said anything foul. Amusing.

&quot;Can you uncuff me?&quot;

The raven-haired one hesitated. At night it was okay to keep her cuffed 
but during the day she could still escape. Well, no one ever has escaped 
from her but can she take the chance?

&quot;Please?&quot;

Rei groaned inwardly. The blonde was giving her the most adorable puppy 
eyes she&#39;s never seen. With an annoyed growl, she walked over and freed 
her hand.

&quot;Oh, thank you!&quot;

There was no response. Serena watched as Rei took out a box, handing it 
to her. Rei grabbed one herself and sat in a chair across the room from 
her. The blonde blinked, hesitant, but her anger pushed all doubts 
aside. So what if the food can be poisoned? At least she won&#39;t die 
starving. Opening the container, the hostage saw that it was pancakes!

&quot;Yum! Thanks.&quot;

Rei only grunted in reply. The girl was too damn bright and fluffy. She 
was being so polite to her kidnapper. Geez.

&quot;So, what are you going to do with me?&quot;

The assassin sighed and took a sip of her coffee. Serena watched her 
anxiously.

&quot;I already told you, I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

Silence.

&quot;It it helps,&quot; Rei began awkwardly, &quot;all of Tokyo is looking for you.&quot;

Serena nodded numbly. &quot;What good is it if they&#39;ll never be able to find 
me?&quot;

Rei looked away. So, she knew her chances of survival were slim. Close 
to none really. She stood and pulled out a newspaper from the bag and 
threw it onto Serena&#39;s bed.

&quot;Something to entertain you.&quot;

Without another word, the assassin sat down again and turned on her 
laptop.

Serena read the headlines quietly.

&#39;Mayor&#39;s Daughter Kidnapped.&#39;

Sadness tugged at her heart almost immediately. Mayor&#39;s daughter, she 
wasn&#39;t Serena Tsukino but just the mayor&#39;s daughter. IF she was anyone 
else&#39;s daughter, no one would give a crap. Then again, is she was anyone 
else&#39;s daughter, she wouldn&#39;t have been kidnapped.

&#39;Might as well,&#39; she thought as she began to read the article.

~Police are baffled by the disappearance of the daughter of the mayor. 
Twenty-three year old Serena Tsukino was abducted after canceling a date 
with her fianc&eacute;, the famous actor Mamoru Chiba. Police suspect that a 
love affair led to her disappearance. ~

With a scream of rage and frustration, the blonde threw the paper across 
the room. Rei looked up from her work, alert and slightly shocked.

&quot;Get that trash away from me!&quot;

Serena buried her face into the pillows, muffling her sobs. The assassin 
gazed at her in confusion before standing to retrieve the paper. As her 
eyes scanned the article, she felt her own anger rise.

The article not only accused Tsukino of having an affair, but with her, 
or Rebecca! Now all of Tokyo thought the poor girl was a lesbian using 
Chiba for fame and fortune. Furthermore, it described Minako as &quot;a 
bisexual slit of a party girl that led her cousin down the road of sin, 
adultery and lesbianism. The blonde was not fit to perform.&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; she whispered heatedly, tossing the paper into the trash.

She then turned her attention to the crying blonde on the bed. 
Hesitantly, Rei approached, placing her hands slowly on the shaking 
shoulders of the hostage.

Serena sat up suddenly, her tear-filled eyes locking onto Rei&#39;s. Guilt 
like she&#39;s never felt before washed over the mercenary like tidal wave. 
Without warning, the blonde launched herself into Rei&#39;s arms as sobs 
shook her petite body.

The raven-haired woman blinked in shock. Uncertainty filled her as she 
wrapped her arms wound the distressed woman, pulling her into a tight 
hug. How does one deal with a heart-broken woman? Guns never needed 
emotional support and other assassins most definitely didn&#39;t need a 
shoulder to cry on. Talk to her about sex, drinking and explosives, she 
was the one you wanted. But how to deal with a crying human being?

Can anyone say &#39;Clueless?&#39;

Serena&#39;s hands clung to the fabric of the assassin&#39;s shirt as she cried. 
After several minutes, the sobs had ceased, though the blonde sniffed 
pathetically once in a while. Serena did not remove herself from the 
assassin, but instead buried her face deeper into the woman&#39;s breasts. 
Rei didn&#39;t know what to do, so she did nothing.

Finally, the blonde pulled away, causing the assassin to smile in 
relief. She was not prepared to see the blazing eyes of Serena Tsukino 
as the blonde growled at her.

&quot;I hate you.&quot;

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Violet eyes blinked as the assassin crushed the urge to groan. Taking a 
look at the clock on the night-stand, she realized it was five in the 
morning. Not a good time to wake up.

The purple eyes then turned to the bed next to hers. The blonde hostage 
was tied to the bed with ropes and chained with handcuffs. After Serena 
calmed down, she unleashed a series of screams and shrieks that almost 
shattered the assassin&#39;s eardrums. The blonde began thrashing, trying to 
escape.

Rei&#39;s pale hand touched the bruise on the side of her mouth softly. The 
girl would sure punch! The assassin jumped on her, one hand covering the 
blonde&#39;s mouth while she kept her on the bed by straddling her. As a 
last resort, Rei delivered a world-shattering slap to the blonde&#39;s 
cheek. The woman quieted, but retaliated with a punch, thus, the bruise.

Rei was then forced to tie her to the bed posts and gag her. As the 
assassin rose from her bed, she discovered that the blonde was asleep. 
With a sigh of relief, she walked into the bathroom.

Serena&#39;s eyes opened. She wrinkled her nose at the gag as she tried to 
move her arms to no avail. Minutes later, the bathroom door opened and 
her eyes quickly shut.

Rei remerged, dressed in all black. She made her way over to the 
blonde&#39;s bed. Thinking that Serena was asleep, she bent over.

The mayor&#39;s daughter could feel her heart pounding in her chest. Would 
Rei hear her? Did it matter? Was the assassin going to kill her?

She felt a feather-light touch on her forehead as a hand brushed a 
strand f hair away.

&quot;I understand,&quot; Rei whispered, her voice soft and... tender. &quot;I 
understand why you hate me. I don&#39;t blame you. If I were you, I&#39;d hate 
me too. I promise, I&#39;ll try to make this as easy for you as I can. Sleep 
well, Tsukino. I promise things will be okay.&quot;

Serena let out a strangled sob as the door closed behind the woman. How 
can Rei possibly understand? How dare she think she can play with 
people&#39;s lives and freedom? Maybe she did know and she just didn&#39;t care. 
Please, let her be dreaming.

As Serena opened her eyes and realized this wasn&#39;t a dream, tears 
trailed down her cheeks, following the paths that others took not more 
than two hours ago. Why did Rei make a promise she can never keep?

~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~

Ah, I finally typed the chapter! Yay! I am so lazy! Though you guys 
don&#39;t need to know that. Heh.

Okay, I don&#39;t know what to say about this chapter. Umm... Serena sure 
can punch, can&#39;t she? Yeah... um... anything else?</pre>
