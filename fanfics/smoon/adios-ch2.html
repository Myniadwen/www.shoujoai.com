<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>~Show me the meaning
Of being lonely...~ 

&quot;Excuse me..Pardon me... I&#39;m sorry, excuse me...&quot; Makoto hated plane 
flights. She hated planes period.

Especially if *she* was on one and it about to take off. 

Makoto moved down the small isle of the plane, a small carry on bag in 
one hand, her plane ticket in the other. Although no one but her knew, 
another passenger was tucked away in her brown leather jacket.

Ace didn&#39;t move and kept very still. As if knowing if Makoto was 
caught with him, they&#39;d both be kicked off the plane. 

Finding her seat, Makoto placed her bag in the over head storage bin 
and took her seat. Her seat was next to the window and despite the 
fact that meant she could look down and see how high up she was, she 
was thankful she didn&#39;t have to sit in the middle. 

Ten minutes or so later, a lady with a little girl took a seat next to 
her, the little girl sitting next to Makoto.

Makoto gave the small girl and the child returned it with a shy one. 

After a few more moments, the plane began pull away from the terminal 
and Makoto&#39;s body locked up.

She closed her eyes tightly as she felt the plane speed up then tilt 
upwards. Her nails dug into the arm rests as she felt the plane leave 
the ground completly and take off into the air. She finally relaxed 
about five minutes later when the plane leveled out. 

After she got control of her breathing again, Makoto unzipped her coat 
and took out the photo her pen pal had sent her. She smiled looking at 
her new friend&#39;s face, thinking she and her friends were very 
beautiful.

But, no one could hold a candle to the blonde in the photo with the 
red bow. Makoto&#39;s heart broke as she thought back to her friend&#39;s 
funeral... 

#####flash back##### 

All was quiet as the preacher spoke. The day, despite the funeral, was 
very beautiful; warm, sunny...an over all nice spring day. 

Mrs. Patterson wiped her eyes, her husband standing next to her, 
holding her hand. The old woman looked to her to her left, her heart 
breaking more at what she saw. 

Makoto stood very still and ridged, no movements coming from her 
except for her breathing and a tear sliding down her face from time to 
time. Mrs. Patterson looked at her husband then let go of his hand, 
walking over to Makoto and gently taking her hand. Makoto blinked and 
looked at her former guardian and squeezed the woman&#39;s hand back, but 
remained silent. 

Mrs. Patterson sadly looked at Makoto then back to the casket that 
held her &#39;daughter&#39;. 

Makoto sighed sadly as the casket was lowered into the ground. Her 
heart brke as everyone gently tossed in a rose then left. Makoto was 
the last to leave staring at the casket that was now inside the grave 
diggen for it. Her heart breaking more knowing th elove of her life 
and her best friend were gone. 

~So many words for the broken heart
It&#39;s hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me 
Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can&#39;t be there where you are
There&#39;s something missing in my heart~ 

Makoto sighed and slammed her door shut after she entered her 
apartment. It had only been a few days that Minako had died and Makoto 
felt as tho it had been years upon years. 

She threw her black dress jacket at her coat rack, not caring if it 
landed on it or in the floor. She didn&#39;t bother to look either. She 
made her way zombie like to her couch and fell forward on it, laying 
on her stomache, one arm and leg slightly hanging off into the floor. 

She felt something warm brush up against her arm and looked down to 
see Ace rubbing his furry head against her arm. Smiling a little bit, 
Makoto gently scratched his head behind his ears and he purred, 
closing his eyes and sitting next to his owner in the floor. She 
gently ran her hand from his head to his tail in slow calming motions 
befor placing her hand up under her chin for more support. He tilted 
his head sadly at her befor crouching and jumping on to her back, 
curling up at her lower back. He began to purr soflty and Makoto 
smiled yet again. Even if it was a small one. 

~So many words for the broken heart
It&#39;s hard to see in a crimson love
So hard to breathe
Walk with me, and maybe
Nights of light so soon become
Wild and free I could feel the sun
Your every wish will be done
They tell me~ 

Makoto sighed as reality,rushed back, flooding her mind. Two hours 
passed, and she was still on the plane. She figured another hour or so 
and she would be in Tokyo. 

Makoto settled her gaze back onto the photo and smiled. Her pen pal 
was very beautiful. She had raven hair with striking violet eyes. Hino 
Rei...Makoto smiled more. She wondered what kind of voice she had.

Rei probably thought the same of her, Makoto assumed. 

Makoto sighed again and placed the photo back into her jacket pocket. 
As she removed her hand, a small blue furry head popped out of her 
shirt and looked around curiously. The little girl next to Makoto 
smiled as she looked at the cat&#39;s head. 

Ace turned, feeling eyes stareing at him, and meowed at the small 
girl. The little child giggled and Ace jumped from out of Makoto&#39;s 
shirt and into his owner&#39;s lap. The little girl giggled once again as 
she reached over to pet the cat&#39;s head and he purred under her touch. 

Ace seemed to smile as he jumped from Makoto&#39;s lap into the little 
girl&#39;s, purring and rubbing his head under her chin, making her giggle 
more. The little girl then looked up at Makoto and asked, &quot;What&#39;s its 
name?&quot; 

Makoto smiled and answered, &quot;His name is Ace. He likes to be scratched 
here,&quot; Makoto said reaching over and gently scratching Ace behind his 
ears. The girl smiled and when Makoto removed her hand, the girl 
mimicked her move and scratched Ace behind his ears. Ace seemed to 
smile more and his purrs grew in volume, enjoying being scratched 
here. 

~Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can&#39;t be there where you are
There&#39;s something missing in my heart~ 

Makoto smiled at the little girl as she returned Ace back to her. Ace 
was quickly placed back into her shirt, her jacket quickly being 
zipped back up. 

Makoto then fastened her seatbelt as the plane began to desend into 
Tokyo National. The landing was much rougher than Makoto had thought 
it would be. But she was mor ethankful the plane hadn&#39;t crashed like 
the one that had claimed bothher parents&#39; lives. 

As the plane pulled into the terminal, Makoto finally noticed it was 
night time. She sighed as the plane finally stopped. She waited for 
the girl and her mother to gather their things befire standing and 
getting her bag from the storage bin above her seat. 

After she got her bag, Makoto quickly moved with the other passengers, 
trying to get off the plane in one peice. As soon as she got off the 
plane, she moved to the side, looking for her friend. she quickly 
found her friend and smiled as she waved at her. 

&quot;Rei-chan!! Rei! Over here,&quot; Makoto called out in Japanese. The raven 
haired girl arched her neck and smiled greatkly as she saw her friend 
waving at her, still next to the loading gate. 

&quot;Makoto-chan!&quot; rei called out, walking quickly to her friend. As soon 
as she reached her, Makoto dropped her bag to engulf the smaller woman 
into a warm sisterly embrace. Rei laughed as she pulled away from 
Makoto. &quot;You are much taller than I thought you would be Makoto-chan.&quot; 

Makoto laughed and picked up her bag. &quot;Please, call me &#39;Mako-chan.&#39; 
We&#39;re friends, ne?&quot; 

Rei smiled. &quot;Hai.&quot; Rei giggled and took Makoto&#39;s left hand and guided 
her away from the terminal.

&quot;Come on, Mako-chan. I wanna get your things and get you home.&quot; 

Makoto laughed while she was being pulled by her new friend. &quot;Wait up, 
Rei-chan. You&#39;re pulling my arm off!&quot; 

~Life goes on as it never ends
Eyes of stone observe the trends
They never say forever gaze
Guilty roads to an endless love
There&#39;s no control
Are you with me now
Your every wish will be done
They tell me~ 

&quot;I&#39;ll show you the temple grounds tomorrow, Mako-chan,&quot; rei said, 
carrying one of her friend&#39;s bags as she led her to the guest room. 
&quot;Its too dark now.&quot; 

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai, I agree. So,&quot; Makoto said smiling and gently 
wrapping an arm around Rei&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Someone&#39;s got a birthday 
coming up in a few weeks.&quot; 

Rei blushed and lowered her head, still guiding Makoto to her room. 
&quot;Hai, I do.&quot; 

Makoto smiled more. &quot;Well...What do you want me to get you for your 
birthday?&quot; 

Rei laughed as the reached the guest room door. &quot;You don&#39;t need to do 
anything for me. I&#39;ll be happy just as long as your my friend.&quot; 

Makoto smiled and sat her bag down. &quot;This is the room I take it?&quot; 

Rei nodded. &quot;Hai,&quot; she answered, sliding the bedroom door open. &quot;Its 
actually very small compared to the other bed rooms. I hope its large 
enough for you.&quot; Rei slipped her hand inside the darkend room and hit 
the light switch. Makoto&#39;s jaw dropped as she set her eyes on her new 
bed room. 

&quot;*THIS* is *SMALL*!?&quot; 

Rei laughed and nodded, walking inside the room, setting the bag she 
had been carrying next to the bed.

&quot;Hai.&quot; 

Makoto laughed and shook her head, also walking inside the room. &quot;This 
room is more than large enough. I think its bigger then the apartment 
I was living in back in England.&quot; 

&quot;Well,&quot; Rei said looking at the room then at Makoto. &quot;Have any 
questions?&quot; 

Makoto continued to inspect her new room. &quot;Hai. I have a pet cat...&quot; 
At that, Ace&#39;s head finally popped up out of Makoto&#39;s jacket. &quot;Rei 
smiled and petted the cats head. 

&quot;He&#39;s fine,&quot; Rei said. &quot;It is a &#39;he&#39;, ne?&quot; 

Makoto nodded. &quot;Hai. His name is Ace. He won&#39;t get into trouble or 
anything here will he?&quot; 

Rei shook her head. &quot;He should fine just as long as he doesn&#39;t try to 
eat my birds.&quot; 

Makoto laughed. &quot;Iie, he&#39;ll be good. Won&#39;tcha Ace?&quot; Ace meowed and 
clawed his way out of Makoto&#39;s shirt and jacket, jumping onto the 
floor, observing his new home as well. &quot;See? He&#39;s a good kitty.&quot; 

Rei laughed and hugged Makoto. &quot;Oyasumi nassi, Mako-chan. I&#39;ll come 
and wake you up in the morning for breakfast.&quot; Rei then left the room, 
shutting the door behind her. Makoto smiled and sat down on her bed. 
Ace rubbed up against her leg and purred beforeing jumping up to sit 
next to her on the bed. Makoto gently petted his head before taking 
the picture back out of her jacket and looking at her Angel&#39;s face 
once more. 

~Show me the meaning of being lonely
Is this the feeling I need to walk with
Tell me why I can&#39;t be there where you are
There&#39;s something missing in my heart~ 

&quot;Let us out of here, Kunzite,&quot; Mars yelled. 

&quot;Let us out now,&quot; Sailor Moon added. 

Kunzite laughed as he shrunk the black dome that contained the four 
sailor senshi inside, slowly stealing their energy away. 

&quot;Shrink to fit,&quot; Kunzite yelled out, the dome shrinking on the four 
senshi taht were inside of it. Their screams of pain echoed through 
out the construction site. 

A few moments passed and Zoicite appeared next to Kunzite. 

&quot;Did you get the nijizuishou,&quot; Kunzite asked. 

Zoicite shook his head. &quot;&#39;Iie. I was attacked by someone...I think it 
was another sailor senshi...&quot; 

&quot;But Zoicite,&quot; Kunzite started, &quot;Can&#39;t you see that I have all the 
senshi in the dome?&quot; 

&quot;Hai, thats what I thought too....&quot; Zoicite was confused as to who 
attacked him when he was fighting Tuxedo Kamen. 

The screams of the senshi cut through the the blonde&#39;s train of 
thought, making him snap back into reality. His gaze fell apon the 
dome and the senshi inside. They were all doubled over, trying their 
best to stay on their feet. 

&quot;Come out come out, where ever you are Cape Boy,&quot; Zoicite called out. 
&quot;Give us the nijizuishou, and we promise them a quick death instead of 
a slow one.&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t do it, Tuxedo Kamen,&quot; Sailor Moon called out. 

&quot;Quiet,&quot; Kunzite called out, shrinking the dome further, the senshi 
falling to their knees. 

&quot;Don&#39;t you care about your little fanclub, Tuxedo Kamen,&quot; Zoicite 
called out again. 

Tuxedo Kamen, wounded and leaning against the wall, walked out from 
behind his hiding place, ready to give up his nijizuishou to save the 
senshi. &quot;Let them go! I&#39;ll give you the nijizuishou if you let them go 
and don&#39;t hurt them.&quot; 

The two generals&#39; heads turned towards the wounded Tuxedo Kamen, both 
smiling cruely. &quot;Give us the nijizuishou and we&#39;ll kill them quickly,&quot; 
Zoicite said. 

&quot;Let them go, and I&#39;ll give it to you.&quot; Tuxedo Kamen&#39;s mind raced, 
trying to figure out how to free the senshi with out having to 
sacrifice the nijizuishou. 

*What am I going to do,* Tuxedo Kamen thought to himself. *Oh, 
Kmai-sama...help them please!* 

&quot;Whats it gonna be, Cape Boy,&quot; Zoicite asked again, his green eyes 
narrowing. 

&quot;Don&#39;t do it,&quot; Venus cried out. 

&quot;I said shut up!&quot; Kunzite once again shrunk the dome, the senshi 
crying out in pain once again. 

Kunzite and Zoicite laughed as the senshi fell more in pain as Tuxedo 
Kamen&#39;s mind raced. He slowly began to reach into his coat pocket to 
remove the nijizuishou. As his hand clenched around it, he heard the 
same voice from when he and Zoicite had battled earlier. 

&quot;If you release them,&quot; the voice said, &quot;I will promise *you* a quick 
death!&quot; 

&quot;There it is,&quot; Zoicite said. &quot;There&#39;s that voice again!&quot; 

A light from the left caming blazing towards the generals, slicing the 
tops of Kunzite&#39;s hands. With hands wounded, the dome of dark energy 
entraping the senshi shattered, setting them free. 

Sailor Venus stood and scanned the shadows from which the light beam 
had come from. She saw a figure begining to walk from out of the 
shadows and towards the generals. Zoicite stepped out in front of 
Kunzite, sheilding him since his hands had been injured. 

The rest of the senshi, although cautious of the two generals, also 
turned their gazes to see the person who had helped them. 

The shadowed warrior stepped away from the darkness, his....actually, 
HER features becoming more visable under the lights of the 
construction yard. The senshi gasped at what they saw. The person who 
had saved them had feathered wings of soft white, the tips of the 
feathers a sparkeling emerald green. The woman&#39;s body was tanned 
evenly and dark. Her dark green hair went down below her shoulders and 
her deep emerald eyes were narrowed towards the two generals. 

The generals&#39; mouths dropped as they saw the new winged warrior. As 
they backed up, Tuxedo Kamen saw another shadowed figure drop behind 
the enemies. He wasn&#39;t aware of it having wings until it spread them 
as it stood. Once it stood up completly, it took in a deep breath and 
crouched over, roaring loudly. 

The generals turned quickly as they jumped from the surprise, the 
senshi quickly turning their gaze back to the generals. They backed 
away from the creature that had just roared at them. And, in turn, the 
creature stepped out of the shadows and into the light. 

This winged warrior was defently male, wearing only a loin cloth, 
compared to his comrade who was wearing a sports bra type top, 
army-style pants and combat boots. All of which where black. The male 
was not human based like the girl. He had the body of a tiger, his fur 
blue, not orange. But the original white and black markings on a tiger 
were still present in their true colors on his body. His eyes were 
narrowed at the generals, glowing a feirce forrest green. His teeth 
bared and his ears were laid back, growling at Kunzite and Zoicite. 

Zoicite reformed his ice sword in his hand, ready to fight. His 
gazequickly shot back towards the other stranger. She simply stood 
there, her wings now drapped over her shoulders much like a cape and 
her arms crossed over her chest. 

As Zoicite took his fighting stance, several dark purple lighting 
bolts gathered everyone&#39;s attention toward the sky. It was Queen 
Beryl. 

&quot;Kunzite! Zoicite! Let them be! There are too many,&quot; she barked. 

&quot;But Queen Beryl,&quot; Kunzite started, &quot;We have yet to retrive the 
nijizuishou!&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m aware of that,&quot; Beryl replied. 

&quot;Queen Beryl, please,&quot; Zoicite pleaded. &quot;We can win thins fight!&quot; 

&quot;How DARE you ignore my orders! Get back here NOW,&quot; Beryl shouted. 

&quot;Hai, my queen,&quot; Kunzite said. 

Zoicite leaned his head towards his fellow general. &quot;We&#39;re in for an 
earful,&quot; he whispered and Kunzite smirked. Turning back to the others, 
Zoicite said, &quot;We&#39;ll be back!&quot; Then both the holloghram of Beryl and 
the two generals dissappeared. 

The tiger took in a deep breath and snorted, blowing dust from his 
nose. The female warrior gave him a lopsidded grin, watching Tuxedo 
Kamen disappear around the cornor. 

The senshi turned to study their saviors, wondering if they were 
actaully friends or foes. 

&quot;Good work, Yung Hu,&quot; the woman said. &quot;Lets go.&quot; The tiger nodded and 
began to walk towards his female companion.

As they began to walk away, Sailor Moon ran to them and stopped them. 
&quot;Wait! Please wait,&quot; she called until the two finally turned around. 

&quot;Hai,&quot; the woman asked. &quot;What is it?&quot; 

Sailor Moon smiled as she bowed. &quot;I just wanted to thank you for your 
help tonight.&quot; 

The woman smiled. &quot;Dou itashimashite, Sailor Moon.&quot; 

Sailor Moon blushed and smiled. &quot;Well, you know my name. May I know 
yours?&quot; 

&quot;Its Mitsukai,&quot; she said bowing in respect. &quot;And this is Yung Hu,&quot; she 
said, motioning towards the tiger who was with her. He smiled and 
nodded his respect. Sailor Moon smiled. 

As Sailor Moon and Mitsukai spoke to one another, the rest of the 
senshi joined their leader, also wanting to know who their new friends 
were. 

When the senshi approached, Sailor Moon smiled more. &quot;These are my 
fellow senshi. That is Sailor Mercury,&quot; she said pointing to the blue 
haired girl. She smiled a little and nodded. Mitsukai and Yung Hu 
nodded back. &quot;Thats Mars,&quot; pointing to the senshi of fire. Mars smiled 
and waved. The two new warriors smiled back. &quot;And this is Sailor 
Venus,&quot; Sailor Moon said, patting Venus&#39;s back. Yung Hu smiled as 
Venus, but Mitsukai&#39;s smiled faded and her eeys narrowed slightly. 

&quot;We&#39;ve met,&quot; she said coldly. Sailor Venus looked at Mitsuakai as she 
said that, trying to place where they may have met. 

Giving one more icy glare, she turned on her heal and spread her wings 
quickly, flapped them a couple of time befor crouching down and taking 
flight. Yung Hu watched her go and smiled weakly at the senshi. 

&quot;Gomen ne,&quot; he said before turning and quickly doing what Mitsuakai 
had done, leaving the senshi there alone, confused as to what had just 
happened....
