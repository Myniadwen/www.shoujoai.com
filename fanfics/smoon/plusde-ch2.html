<h1>Plus de Compassion (More Than Sympathy) (part 2 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/aeagle.html">April Eagle</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/plusde-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>At the beginning of December it started to snow and it didn&#146;t stop. 
Soon nature and even the big city laid under a thick, white blanket. 
It got very cold and very slippery.

&#147;What the hell do you want in the city at a lousy day like this one?&#148; 
asked Haruka as she slipped over the icy pavement. Michiru next to her 
had a very concentrated expression on her face as she tried to steer 
the wheelchair through the snow. More than once she lost control and 
more than once Haruka held her back so that she couldn&#146;t slip on the 
street where a lot of cars were passing by. For the young racer they 
were all too fast for the icy asphalt.

&#147;You know that this month&#146;s special.&#148; Declared Michiru and grabbed the 
wheels as she lost again the control. She wore a thick robe and the 
scarf hide almost all of her face while a dark cap protected her hairs 
from the snow that was coming down very quickly now. It barred their 
views and suddenly Michiru wondered why she&#146;d left the warmth of their 
apartment. She sweat under her robe but at the same time her legs were 
almost frozen. She shivered but concentrated again on the wheelchair. 
The streets weren&#146;t made for people like her and often Haruka had to 
help her to left the pavement, cross the street and got at the next 
pavement.

&#147;And you know my opinion about Christmas.&#148; Declared Haruka and shook 
her head. They discussed for several hours without getting a result. 
Michiru wanted to celebrate the festival of love while Haruka rather 
wanted to forget about it.

The young violinist was intelligent enough to overhear the silent 
words of her best friend.

&#147;Actually I wanted in this department store.&#148; She pointed at a huge 
building but her smile broke as she saw the three steps that leaded up 
to the entrance door. &#147;But...&#148; she whispered and wanted to turn the 
wheelchair around as Haruka held her back.

&#147;Hey, don&#146;t run away. You wanted to go shopping? Now we&#146;re here and 
you even have me as a victim to carry all your bags. Like a real 
gentleman.&#148; Haruka was relieved as she saw the little smile on her 
best friend&#146;s pale face as she bowed. Then she went into the 
department store and came back with a boy that seemed to belong to the 
service staff. While Haruka carried her Michiru into the warm building 
the boy pushed the wheelchair into the department store.

&#147;Arigato.&#148; Said Haruka and sat the young violinist down again.

She became so slim. How much weight did she loose since the accident?

&#147;Let&#146;s separate. I want to buy something you shouldn&#146;t see. And 
otherwise you don&#146;t wanna watch me buying lousy clothes, do you?&#148;

Haruka smiled as Michiru disappeared between the people in the 
department store. Slowly she walked through the shelves and looked at 
several books. A girl with shoulder long blue hairs hold a very thick 
one in her hands. She looked up and smiled at her. Haruka 
automatically smiled back.

&#147;This is a very good one.&#148; Said the girl then she headed towards the 
counter and was gone after she paid. One hour passed away when Haruka 
started looking after her Michiru. Surely she had already bought what 
she wanted and now it was time to return. It was already dark outside 
and the storm even increased. Haruka wanted to be at Mugen Gakkuen 
before the snow covered the street completely that leaded towards the 
towers.

After ten minutes the young racer got worried and she wanted to go to 
the information as she saw the figure sitting in the shadows near the 
entrance door. Michiru had lowered her head and stared with empty eyes 
into nothing. Her robe was dirty and she hold her head with her 
trembling hands.

&#147;Everything okay?&#148; asked Haruka alarmed and went on her knees next to 
the wheelchair to take a look into her best friend&#146;s now 
expressionless pale face.

&#147;Sure. One kid called me a cripple and splashed me with his cola. An 
old woman argued with me that I stood in her way. I didn&#146;t get quickly 
enough out of it. And a young woman with a baby in her arms almost 
fell over me but it wasn&#146;t her fault. I am so tiny now that she 
couldn&#146;t see me!&#148; said Michiru with a quiet, insensible voice. 
&#147;Actually I have to go to the toilette, but this wonderful chair 
doesn&#146;t fit through the door and the service woman there couldn&#146;t help 
me. Maybe they have parking space for handicapped people out there, 
but they don&#146;t have one single toilette. And after all this department 
store is a trap! I am not even able to leave it when I want to.&#148; She 
raised her hand and pointed at the three steps.

There were no bags. Michiru obviously didn&#146;t find what she wanted. Or 
she simply didn&#146;t have the time to. Haruka took a deep breathe then 
she stroke over the sea green hairs.

&#147;Let&#146;s return to Mugen Gakkuen.&#147; she said and made a mental note never 
to visit this store again. Michiru didn&#146;t reply anything. She simply 
nodded and buried her face in Haruka&#146;s shoulder as she carried her 
downstairs out to the cold, cruel world.

***

Haruka opened the door and looked surprised at the man who was wearing 
a fir. The green branches almost touched the ground and the tree was 
as high as the young racer.

&#147;Michiru?&#148; Haruka turned around to look in the innocent smiling face 
of her best friend. &#147;What the hell is that?&#148; The taller girl pointed 
at the man from the delivery service and at the tree.

&#147;It&#146;s our Christmas tree.&#148; Answered the young violinist and looked 
with that pleading expression up to her best friend. She rolled next 
to her and took the money out of her pockets to pay the man.

&#147;I told you, no music, no mistle toes and especially no trees!&#148; Haruka 
crossed her arms before her chests and her green eyes shone cold as 
the man put the tree in the middle of the living-room. With a short 
bow he took the money and left.

&#147;Don&#146;t be such a spoilsport!&#148; declared Michiru and rolled over to the 
cupboard where the tree jewellery laid. It was only white and silver 
and a lot of real candles. Haruka wondered if she really wanted to 
burn them. Maybe it looked romantic but it was also very dangerous.

&#147;I am not a spoilsport. I simply don&#146;t like this crazy behaviour of 
people at a time like this. It&#146;s just a method of advertising, nothing 
more! They just want people to buy more.&#148; Answered Haruka and went 
over in the kitchen. She didn&#146;t want to look in the oven. Today was 
Christmas Eve and of course Michiru made a special dinner. It smelled 
delicious and if Haruka had been honest to herself she would have 
admitted that she couldn&#146;t wait to taste it.

&#147;That&#146;s not your seriousness!&#148; she heard Michiru&#146;s indignant voice and 
sighed slightly. She opened the fridge but suddenly she had forgotten 
what she wanted.

&#147;It is, Michiru!&#148; she came back and looked critical at the Christmas 
tree. It wasn&#146;t set up and it was surely too high for the handicapped 
girl to reach the crown. But Haruka was too angry to care about it. 
She told Michiru over the last four weeks over and over again that she 
didn&#146;t want to celebrate Christmas. The smaller girl seemed to 
understand. And now that silly tree!

Why can&#146;t she respect my feelings?

Haruka clenched her fists and reached for her jacket that laid on the 
white couch near the huge windows.

&#147;But it would be fun. It was always fun to celebrate Christmas with my 
parents.&#148; Said the young violinist with a suddenly quiet voice and 
watched her best friend getting dressed for the snowy day outside.

&#147;Your parents are dead! Accept it!&#148; snapped Haruka and looked straight 
at her boots.

As dead as my mother.

&#147;Better I&#146;ll go for a walk.&#148; She declared and almost run out of the 
apartment. She wasn&#146;t in the mood to argue with Michiru. She knew she 
would loose control when they talked about that topic. And she didn&#146;t 
want to hurt Michiru more than she already did.

&#147;Hai...&#148; The young violinist took a silver shinning ball in her 
trembling hands and could see her sad face reflected in it. &#147;They&#146;re 
dead.&#148; She said with a cold voice and rolled over to the huge 
Christmas tree. It was too heavy for her to set it up. She knew it. 
And it was too high to decorate it perfectly.

&#147;They are dead.&#148; Suddenly she yelled at the closed door and threw the 
ball at it. The silver cracked and splinters fell upon the carpet. 
Michiru couldn&#146;t held back a sob. She lowered her head and clenched 
her fists around the armrest of the wheelchair she was trapped in. 
Even if she wanted she couldn&#146;t chase Haruka anymore. The young racer 
had been too fast two years ago but now she couldn&#146;t even reach her if 
Haruka was only walking in a normal tempo.

Cripple.

Michiru swallowed hard and didn&#146;t want to think of the gift that laid 
save and secure under her bed.

Maybe she doesn&#146;t want it.

&#147;They are dead. But I am still alive...&#148; It was not more than a shaky 
whisper.

***

*We wish you a marry Christmas and a happy new year. We wish...*

Haruka rolled her eyes as she heard the music that filled the streets 
of Tokyo. She slipped over the icy pavement and cursed herself for 
being so rude to Michiru. She didn&#146;t want to behave so silly but her 
hot temper controlled too often her words. More than once she said 
hurting things to the smaller girl at the past few weeks. Things she 
regretted some minutes later when she thought about it.

*Silent night...*

Haruka stopped in front of a huge shop window and looked at the little 
angels and the small Santa Clauses. Of course she brought a gift and 
secretly she was happy to see Michiru being interested in more than 
her English, French or maths books. All that seemed to be left for the 
young violinist was the school. She learned hard and got good marks. 
But hardly she left the towers. After the short trip to the inner city 
of Tokyo Michiru didn&#146;t want to go out anymore. Rumiko once told 
Haruka that the smaller girl was very good in drawing but she only did 
it in the lessons. And the pictures looked different from the ones she 
used to draw two years ago when they first met. After school Michiru 
only left the apartment for her weekly appointments at the doctor. The 
rest of the time she sat in her wheelchair on her bedroom and learned. 
Or she simply looked out of the window with her headphones over her 
ears. She only listened to one song.

Only one sad song over six weeks now!

Haruka clenched her fists and shook her head. Slowly Michiru&#146;s 
behaviour changed when Christmas came. She took part in different 
courses at school where they made cookies and tree jewellery. Rumiko 
said that she smiled more and looked happier in those lessons and 
suddenly her drawing changed a little bit. She draw white forests and 
a picture of one Santa Clause was even chosen for the school calendar 
next year because he looked so real. Michiru took away the CD with the 
sad song and brought last week when she went into a job after her 
visit in the hospital a CD with Christmas music.

And I fool switched off the CD player each time she wanted to listen 
to it.

Haruka took a deep breathe and stepped back. Snow fell down on her and 
soon her cap and her thick black robe were white.

*I am dreaming of a white Christmas...*

Hai, Michiru was dreaming of such a Christmas. It was the first 
Christmas without her parents.

And you remembered her that they&#146;re dead. You baka!

But I hate this festival! It took me so much! It changed my life 
forever. It made it to a hell I couldn&#146;t escape for almost ten 
years...

Haruka laid her head in the neck and looked up to the cloudy sky. 
People hurried by but she didn&#146;t really mention them. Today was 
Christmas Eve and the last people were searching for the perfect or 
simply for the cheapest gift that looked a lot more expensive.

*Hark! The Herald angels sing. Glory to...*

Today&#146;s festival of love. And Michi-chan wanted to celebrate it with 
me. ..

Haruka watched her breathe in the air. Soon it got darker and although 
it was just late afternoon dawn came. It was a dark, cool season and 
she started to hate it when she was five years old.

But for Michi-chan I can try to forget this hate.

The young racer looked back into the shop window and automatically 
started to grin as something caught her eyes. Something really cute 
she simply couldn&#146;t leave there.

Michi-chan went through so much pain. It&#146;s not fair from me hurting 
her with my silly behaviour. It isn&#146;t her fault that my mother died at 
Christmas Eve ten years ago.

The girl opened her fists and took the cape from her slightly wet 
blonde hairs as she entered the shop.

*I am just a poor boy, too....*

***

The bag was very big and she almost stumbled over the gift that laid 
in front of their apartment&#146;s door. Haruka swore quietly and bowed to 
pick it up. She heard giggle and turned around. She saw the shadows of 
several girls turning around the corner towards the elevator.

Silly brats!

Haruka looked at the gift for some seconds and opened the letter under 
the loop. &#147;Merry Christmas, Haruka. Your Ayako.&#148; She read aloud and 
frowned. This gift whatever it was, it was just for her. Not for her 
and Michiru. But that didn&#146;t surprise the young racer. Ayako had a 
crash on her although Haruka simply ignored her. It looks as if she 
won&#146;t give up that fast.

Haruka sighed and shook her head. Ayako didn&#146;t dare to laugh over 
Michiru in her presence but some gestures could hurt more than every 
rude word. Ayako behaved as if Michiru was only air or a burden for 
the whole class. She didn&#146;t care about the wheelchair and more than 
once the young violinist had to ask for help when Ayako stood her 
school bag in the way. Some girls joined her club, as Haruka called 
the silly brats, but there were other girls who liked Michiru. Rumiko 
for example. Soon she became a very good friend and she tried to 
defend Michiru when Haruka wasn&#146;t around.

Some day Ayako will pay for her behaviour!

Haruka sighed then she opened the door. Today was Christmas Eve and 
she didn&#146;t want to ruin it because of some stupid girls.

If I didn&#146;t already ruin it by myself!

It cracked as Haruka walked over the broken silver ball. The young 
racer frowned and took the bag into her bedroom. She hung her wet 
jacket in the bathroom and threw the still wrapped present into the 
dustbin without looking at it again.

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148; she hesitated but then she entered the living-room. The 
tree leaned at the armchair where the man from the delivery service 
had left it. More silver splinters laid around it on the soft carpet. 
The roast was still in the oven and it smelled even more delicious as 
Haruka could remember. Suddenly the young racer felt guilty. She did 
so much for this festival and I was just shouting at her.

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148; she entered the bedroom and could see the figure sitting 
in her wheelchair looking out of the window. She had her headphone on 
but it was Christmas music she listened to, not the sad song as Haruka 
recognized relieved. The young violinist moved her lips to the music 
and her look was sad as she stared out to the sea. Sad and yearning.

Haruka put her arms around her shoulders and pulled her closer. She 
leaned over the smaller girl and looked directly into those blue eyes 
she loved so much. Michiru winced surprised then a smile appeared on 
her pale face as she saw the guilty expression on her best friend&#146;s 
face.

&#147;You&#146;re right in time, Ruka. Dinner&#146;s almost ready.&#148; She declared and 
put the headphones from her ears. Silent music filled the air. 

*One small child in a land of a thousand, one small dream of a Saviour 
tonight, one small hand reaching out to the star light...*

&#147;Gomen, Michi-chan. I didn&#146;t want to yell at you.&#148; Whispered Haruka 
and pressed her cheek against Michiru&#146;s one and squeezed the smaller 
girl gently in her arms.

&#147;No problem, my wild racer.&#148; Replied Michiru in the same quiet voice 
and raised her hand to stroke the short blonde hairs. She liked that 
feeling having her Ruka near. She knew that she was the only one 
Haruka had ever asked for excuse. And she knew that she was the only 
one who saw the young racer the way she actually was. At school she 
was detached, cold and unreachable. But with her she was a complete 
different person. She could be understanding, comforting. Loving. She 
listened to her problems, dispelled her fears. She&#146;s with me in my 
darkest hours.

Michiru closed her eyes and enjoyed the embrace of the other girl.

Please, don&#146;t ever let me go!

&#147;Michi-chan?&#148; she heard the giggle in the low voice and as she opened 
her eyes again she saw the grinning face above.

&#147;Hai?&#148; she simply returned the smile and leaned her head against 
Haruka&#146;s chest.

&#147;Where do you want the Christmas tree to stand?&#148;

***

&#147;Don&#146;t make it so exciting!&#148; Michiru rolled next to the sparkling 
Christmas tree. Haruka helped her to decorate it and the candles 
burned now and dove the room in a dimmed light. In a romantic 
atmosphere. They enjoyed the dinner Michiru made and Haruka said more 
than once that it was the best Christmas roast she&#146;d ever eaten. 
Normally the gifts were given on Christmas Day and not now but they 
simply couldn&#146;t wait.

&#147;Close your eyes!&#148; shouted Haruka from her bedroom and Michiru could 
hear her swearing as anything crashed the ground loudly.

&#147;Do you need any help?&#148; asked the young violinist and wanted to roll 
over to the door as Haruka&#146;s head appeared in the frame. 

&#147;Are your eyes closed?&#148; 

&#147;Hai!&#148; Michiru took a deep breathe and did as she was told. But a 
happy smile laid on her now redden face. For the first time after her 
accident she looked healthy again. And happy...

Haruka stayed for some moments motionless in front of the smaller 
girl. Her sea green hair fell over her shoulders and she looked 
beautiful in the blue dress she was wearing. The candlelight 
surrounded her and suddenly she looked like an angel.

My angel...

Haruka leaned forward and gave Michiru a light kiss on the nose.

&#147;You can open your eyes again, Michi-chan.&#148; She whispered and went on 
her knees next to the wheelchair. Michiru blinked and looked surprised 
at the huge easel that stood now in the middle of the living-room. It 
was not so high so that she could reach the top while sitting in the 
wheelchair. But it was very wide. Perfect for a drawing of a 
landscape. Several paintbrushes and colours stood around on the 
ground. The young violinist rolled toward the easel and touched 
quietly the linen.

&#147;I thought you&#146;d like to draw a real picture again. You always 
complain that the papers are too small in your club and...&#148; Haruka&#146;s 
voice died away and uncertain she came to her feet. Maybe it hadn&#146;t 
been such a great idea. Maybe Michiru didn&#146;t want to draw such 
complicate pictures again. She had been known in the art&#146;s world as a 
young talent with a shinning future. The old artists liked her style 
and she already had her first exhibition when she was eleven years 
old.

When her parents had been alive...

Michiru closed her eyes still touching the easel. She heard the soft 
violin music the CD player played and slowly a picture evolved in her 
head. Her lips curved in a smile as she felt the old feeling. The 
excitement she had always felt whenever she started a new work of art.

This one is going to be better than all the others before. Because 
this one will be a part of me. It&#146;ll be true.

She opened her eyes again and looked into the asking face of Haruka. 
She rolled over to her best friend and touched her suddenly icy hands.

&#147;Arigato, Ruka.&#148; She whispered and could see the relieved expression 
on the young racer&#146;s pale face.

&#147;But that&#146;s not all.&#148; Haruka took a large bag from under the Christmas 
tree and blushed as she took the gift out of it. &#147;Call me a fool, but 
I couldn&#146;t let it stay alone in the huge shop window.&#148; She mumbled and 
ran a uncertain hand through her short blonde hair while she watched 
her best friend unwrapping the gift. Michiru giggled as she saw the 
big blue toy elephant in her lap. Two big dark eyes looked pleading up 
to her and it seemed to grin at her with his long nose. It felt soft 
in her hands and the big ears moved as she touched them. Michiru 
looked from the toy to the young racer and back. Then she giggled even 
more.

&#147;Perfectly, Ruka. It looks like you. It is as if you gave me a picture 
of you. Guess I&#146;ll call it Ruka-chan. What do you think?&#148;

Haruka blushed even more then she went on her knees and laid her head 
in Michiru&#146;s lap beside the elephant and looked up with that innocent 
expression that made her always giggle. 

&#147;Then I want to be caressed, too.&#148; She demanded and started to purr as 
Michiru stroke her short blonde hair that soon looked messed. Haruka 
closed her green eyes and they both enjoyed for the next moments the 
presence of each other.

&#147;My little kitten.&#148; Whispered Michiru and giggled as the purring 
increased. &#147;Don&#146;t you want your gift, too?&#148;

&#147;It can&#146;t be better than this.&#148; Answered Haruka and looked dreamy up 
to her. Then she smiled and nodded. &#147;What is it?&#148; she asked curiously 
and crept back. Michiru gave the elephant in her arms and rolled over 
the Christmas tree.

&#147;It&#146;s nothing special. But I made it during...&#148; she reached under the 
tree and frowned as she didn&#146;t reach it. &#147;I...&#148; she leaned forward but 
her fingers couldn&#146;t touch it. She stretched her arm a little bit more 
and with a scream she lost balance. She seized on the wheelchair but 
it tipped over. Michiru landed hard on the carpet and the wheelchair 
hit her weak, useless legs. The young violinist wanted to stand up, 
wanted to kick at that bloody vehicle and then run away. But she 
simply couldn&#146;t move. Her bloody legs didn&#146;t obey and so she laid 
helpless under the tree. The gift was grabbed in her trembling right 
hand while she beat the carpet with the left one.

&#147;Shit!&#148; she swore and suddenly tears were filling her eyes. 

Haruka was by her side at the next moment and put the heavy wheelchair 
aside.

&#147;Everything okay?&#148; she asked and took her into her strong arms. 
Michiru nodded but tears shimmered in her deep blue eyes. She hold up 
the gift and the paper was now ripped. Haruka could see black cloth 
with a dark blue picture on it.

&#147;A pullover?&#148; she asked surprised but Michiru just put the gift under 
the tree again.

&#147;That&#146;s all I am able to do now. To knit a lousy pullover.&#148; She 
whispered and wanted to escape from Haruka&#146;s embrace but the taller 
girl just hold her tight.

&#147;You&#146;re to so much able, Michi-chan. I hated Christmas since my mother 
died at Christmas Eve ten years ago. She simply went away and left me 
behind. Alone with my strict father who never wanted me the way I am.&#148; 
Declared Haruka and saw her pale face reflected into the sparkling 
tears. &#147;But with you it&#146;s the best festival I ever celebrated. You 
taught me again what Christmas means. It&#146;s the festival of love and 
for the first time after ten years I am not alone anymore. &#145;Cause I&#146;ve 
got you.&#148; Haruka leaned forward and their lips met for a few seconds. 
It was a light, but very tender touch. Michiru&#146;s eyes grew wide. Then 
she put her arms around the taller girl&#146;s neck and pulled her closer. 

&#147;Ruka...&#148; whispered the young violinist and saw the love that shone in 
dark green eyes. It was such an intensive look she had never seen on 
that normally tomboy face before.

&#147;Michi-chan...&#148; was all Haruka could reply before her voice broke. 
Then they kissed again. The kiss expressed all their feelings to each 
other. All their longing, all their love. It lasted for a long time.

They had kissed before. Two years ago they shared a light kiss. But it 
had been a complete different feeling. They both had been very young. 
Thirteen and twelve years old, almost children. It had been more a 
curious, friendly kiss between two girls who liked each other a lot.

Now it was something different. Now they were older. They faced hell, 
went through it together. Now that kiss felt no longer like a child&#146;s 
kiss. Now it felt like a lover&#146;s kiss. Deep and full of love.

After the kiss ended slowly they looked each other deep into the eyes. 
Michiru leaned her head against Haruka&#146;s shoulder and Haruka buried 
her face in the velvet sea green hairs. They hold each other tight for 
the rest of the evening and didn&#146;t want the other ever to let go.

Soft twilight filled the room and the candlelight created a romantic 
atmosphere. Sweet music hung in the air and it didn&#146;t stop the whole 
evening.

*I wish it could be Christmas every day...*

A blue toy elephant laid on the soft carpet. His big dark eyes watched 
the couple under the Christmas tree. Holding each other tight. In 
loving silence.

The long nose of the toy elephant looked as if he grinned happily.
