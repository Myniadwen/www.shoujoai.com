Ami spun to look at herself in the mirror one last time.  Usagi 
had done an excellent job selecting her bridesmaid dresses.  
Everyone would be wearing a style uniquely suited to her 
appearance and personality, but all would be in the same color 
and share similar accessories, providing a sense of consistency.  

&quot;It&#39;s perfect, Usagi-chan,&quot; Ami told her anxious friend.  &quot;I feel 
so glamorous.&quot;

&quot;You look great,&quot; Usagi agreed. &quot;I bet a certain someone won&#39;t be 
able to keep her eyes off of you,&quot; she added with a knowing wink.

Ami could feel the blush starting even as she darted a glance 
around the bridal shop to make sure that no one was listening.  
&#39;Home for only a day or two, and I&#39;m back to my old habits,&#39; she 
realized.  &#39;I thought I&#39;d learned I have nothing to be ashamed 
of.&#39;  Ami decided it was time to show Usagi that the shy 
wallflower had started to bloom.

&quot;I certainly hope so, though I think it would catch her attention 
better if it showed off more leg,&quot; Ami replied in a matter of 
fact tone.  Carefully, she pulled the hem of the dress up over 
her knee and halfway up her thigh.  &quot;She&#39;s never admitted it, but 
I think Makoto really likes my legs.&quot;  

Usagi stared at Ami dumbfounded for a moment and then broke into 
warm laughter, embracing her friend.  &quot;I&#39;ve missed you so much,&quot; 
she exclaimed happily.  &quot;Did I tell you how much I love my hat?&quot;

&quot;Yes, Usagi-chan, you have.  I&#39;m glad you liked it.&quot;  It had 
taken Ami and her friends the better part of a week of shopping 
in San Francisco to find a cowboy hat small enough, and touristy 
enough, for Usagi. &quot;So when does M.. when do the others arrive?&quot;

Usagi grinned as she escorted Ami back to the dressing room.  
&quot;Rei flew into Singapore from Africa today.  Minako is going to 
pick her up there in her private jet.  They&#39;ll arrive late 
tonight.&quot;  She paused to let Ami stew a bit in her own curiosity.  
&quot;Didn&#39;t Makoto tell you when she&#39;d get in?&quot;

&quot;She was still making the arrangements through her company when I 
left and I haven&#39;t gotten a local email address set up yet.  My 
old account expired when I went abroad and I can&#39;t dial into my 
school one from overseas.&quot;  Ami emerged from her dressing room 
with her gown neatly arranged on the hanger. She looked at Usagi 
expectantly.

&#39;She&#39;s still the same Ami, just more...confident,&#39; Usagi 
considered.  She&#39;d noticed the slight differences in Ami&#39;s 
behavior almost as soon as they&#39;d met her at the airport with 
Ami&#39;s mom: more vocal, less unsure, happier and more at peace.  
Underneath it all, though, Ami was still Ami:  smart, kind, 
caring, and so very much in love with Makoto.  Usagi truly hoped 
that they could sort things out now that they&#39;d be back together 
in person.  &quot;Actually, Mamo-chan told me this morning before I 
came to get you that he&#39;d gotten a call.  She caught an earlier 
flight.  If we leave now, we should be there just in time to 
greet her plane.&quot;  

Ami&#39;s hands immediately went to her hair, straightening it 
unconsciously even as she checked herself in the mirror.  Usagi 
stifled a giggle.  &quot;You look fine, Ami-chan.  Ready to go?&quot;

Realizing what she&#39;d been doing, Ami looked at Usagi sheepishly.  
&quot;I guess I&#39;m a little anxious,&quot; she admitted with an embarrassed 
smile.  

&quot;Everything will work out for the best,&quot; Usagi reassured her.  
&quot;After all, how can I have a happy wedding day if my friends 
aren&#39;t just as happy as I am.&quot;  After a moment&#39;s consideration, 
she reconsidered.  &quot;Well, almost as happy.  I am the bride after 
all!&quot;  Giggling happily, the two young women linked arms and 
headed for the car. 

---------------------

&quot;To the blushing bride!&quot; Haruka yelled, raising her glass.  

Everyone else quieted down and joined her toast, except Usagi who 
persisted in beaming with joy at everyone.  Usagi had refused any 
alcohol for reasons she left unsaid, but which just about 
everyone could guess.  The hostesses for her bachelorette party, 
Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna, had inside information from the 
future, of course.   

The party had been Ami&#39;s idea, a tradition she had learned about 
in the US.  Mamoru had been designated Hotaru&#39;s babysitter for 
the evening and left at home while the senshi gathered all 
together for the first time in far too long.  

As everyone finished draining their glasses from the last toast, 
Rei stood up, leaning a bit on Mina&#39;s shoulder as she did.  She&#39;d 
only had a few drinks (one?  two?  more?), so she knew it must be 
the jet lag making her woozy.  Giving Usagi a wry look, she 
announced, &quot;To Chibi-Usa, who I expect we&#39;ll be seeing again 
within the next six months or so.&quot; 

A round of giggles and congratulations washed over a beet-red 
Usagi. &quot;How did you know?&quot; she sputtered.  

&quot;Unless the Silver Imperium Crystal can restore THAT kind of 
purity, I don&#39;t think anyone is too surprised,&quot; Minako joked.  
&quot;You have been living with him for quite a while and you 
certainly do have a glow about you.&quot;  

&quot;Besides, Ami told us how you spent all morning puking your guts 
out,&quot; Makoto chipped in.  Usagi showed her friends the business 
end of her tongue, bringing a new round of laughter. 

  
Sitting next to Makoto on the couch, Ami gave her a playful jab 
in the arm.  &quot;That was supposed to be a secret,&quot; she accused 
playfully.  

&quot;Ouch!&quot; Makoto yelped. &quot;Have you taken up martial arts too over 
there?&quot;  She rubbed her arm theatrically, grinning at the blush 
that suddenly covered Ami&#39;s cheeks.  For some reason, Makoto&#39;s 
heart raced every time she caught Ami blushing.  

&quot;Now children, play nice,&quot; Michiru scolded them.  &quot;Does anyone 
want anything from the kitchen?&quot;  She realized her mistake as the 
flood of food orders, mostly from Usagi (who proudly declared she 
was now eating for two!), overwhelmed her.  

&quot;I&#39;ll give you a hand, Michiru-san,&quot; Ami offered, standing up.  
As she moved to join Michiru, Ami slid across the front of the 
sofa, pausing for a moment directly in front of Makoto as she 
excused herself.  Though she didn&#39;t dare look down to verify it, 
Ami could feel Makoto&#39;s gaze burning a run in her stockings.  

In the kitchen, Michiru began to prepare a platter of pastries, 
hors d&#39;oeuvres, and other yummies while Ami gathered up some 
napkins and small plates.  &quot;So, how is it going?&quot;  Michiru asked.

&quot;Everything is fine, Michiru-san,&quot; Ami replied carefully. &quot;I&#39;m 
enjoying my studies immensely.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what I meant, Ami-chan, and you know it.  How is it 
going with Makoto?&quot;

Damning her complexion, Ami could feel the heat rising in her 
cheeks.  &quot;How did you know?  Did Usagi show you the tape?&quot;

&quot;We knew before the tape, Ami-chan,&quot; Michiru informed her. &quot;&#39;Ruka 
and I have a certain sense of these things.  Do you want her to 
talk to Makoto?  In a lot of ways, Makoto reminds me of Haruka, 
or at least how she was before she came to terms with her 
feelings for me.&quot;  

Ami sighed.  &quot;No, I don&#39;t think that would be a good idea.  I 
know Haruka would only say the right things, but I think Makoto 
needs to figure things out for herself.&quot;

&quot;She loves you, you know,&quot; Michiru pointed out.  &quot;It&#39;s obvious to 
all of us, just in the way she looks at you if nothing else.&quot;  

&quot;Sometimes, I think you&#39;re right.  Sometimes, I won&#39;t let myself 
believe it.  Even if she does, I don&#39;t think she knows it yet, 
not for sure anyway.&quot;  Ami closed her eyes and took a deep 
breath.  &quot;I&#39;ve waited this long; I can wait more.  Did you know 
that we talk almost every day.  Well, email, but we talk too at 
least once every other week or so.&quot; 

&quot;That&#39;s good, Ami-chan,&quot; Michiru emphasized.  &quot;Your friendship 
will be the foundation for your deeper relationship, once it 
comes.&quot;  Seeing the brief flash of skepticism in Ami&#39;s eyes, she 
continued.  &quot;And it will come, Ami-chan.  Hasn&#39;t the princess 
taught us that nothing can stand before True Love?  Not even our 
Makoto.&quot;

Ami smiled up at the woman she considered both mentor and friend.  
&quot;Thank you, Michiru-san.  No matter how much I think I learn, you 
always find something new to teach me.&quot;  

&quot;Don&#39;t be silly.  Besides, we never would have gotten that new 
computer hooked up right without your help, and Hotaru&#39;s.  She 
really has a way with those things.  Sometimes I think we learn 
just as much from our children as we teach them.&quot;  Michiru sighed 
happily and herded Ami out of the kitchen with her.  

---------------------

The wedding was beautiful, of course.  Yuuichirou and Grandpa 
Hino had outdone themselves decorating the shrine and Grandpa 
performed his duties in a most uncharacteristically solemn 
manner.  Makoto had helped pick the flowers; Minako and Rei had 
collaborated on a song; and Ami had made sure that Usagi was 
ready on time and where she needed to be.  Old friends and new 
joined Mamoru and Usagi on their happy day:  Motoki and Reika, 
recently married themselves;  Naru and Umino, each with their own 
respective significant others; the four Ayakashi sisters as well. 
Perfect weather, good friends, and the union of two pure souls 
deeply in love with each other all made for a splendid winter 
afternoon.  

After the services were complete, and the photos, and the civil 
formalities, everyone adjourned to a nearby hotel ballroom rented 
by Usagi&#39;s parents.  Though she seemed eager to perform, Minako 
was given the night off as a local band played a variety of new 
and classic songs.  It seemed to Usagi that she barely even saw 
her new husband after the services, as they both had social 
duties to attend to, mingling amongst their guests.  While she 
went from table to table, greeting everyone personally, Mamoru 
began the not-so-onerous chore of dancing with each of Usagi&#39;s 
&#39;bridesmaids&#39;.  

&quot;I&#39;m worried, Mamoru-kun,&quot; Ami informed him as they danced later 
that evening.

&quot;About what?&quot; he asked, concerned.  While Mamoru cared for each 
of the senshi to one degree or another, he&#39;d always felt closest 
to Ami and Rei.  He and Ami had a lot in common and tended to 
think in similar ways.  He and Rei had also had one very 
important thing in common for quite a while, and they had dated 
briefly too.  

&quot;About Shingo,&quot; Ami explained. &quot;I just danced with him and I 
practically had to hold him up.  At first, I thought maybe he&#39;d 
had too much to drink, but then I realized that I hadn&#39;t seem him 
touch a drop of alcohol all night.  Then, I thought that maybe he 
was... well, you know he used to have a crush on me way back 
when.&quot;

Mamoru laughed, &quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;s gotten over you by now.&quot;

Ami giggled briefly, &quot;I know, I&#39;m sure he has, too.  Seriously 
though, if not one of those things, what could it be?  He seemed 
so weak.&quot;

With a deep breath, Mamoru dropped his voice to a whisper.  
&quot;Usagi doesn&#39;t like to talk about it because it worries her so 
much.  Shingo has been quite ill for some time.  The doctors have 
done lots of tests, but they can&#39;t find anything specific.  I&#39;m 
sure you&#39;ve seen some of the articles in the medical journals.  
They&#39;re afraid that it&#39;s this new illness that seems to have 
popped up recently.&quot;

Ami gasped in horror.  &quot;Oh no, I have read about that.  It&#39;s 
like a cancer, but generalized over the entire body.  No one 
knows what&#39;s causing it or how to treat it.&quot;

Mamoru nodded gravely.  &quot;Frankly, I&#39;m very worried, though I try 
to put on a brave front for Usagi.  Even worse, Kenji has been 
sick lately too, in the same ways.  I don&#39;t know what we can do 
other than pray and give them, and Usagi, all of our support.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll talk to my mom and see if she knows anything,&quot; Ami 
declared. 

&quot;Anything you can do would be a help,&quot; Mamoru murmured.  &quot;Please, 
don&#39;t say anything about it to Usagi, though.&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t do anything to upset her, Mamoru-kun, especially not 
on her wedding day,&quot; Ami reassured him.   Sadly, she glanced over 
to the head table where both Shingo and Kenji were &#39;sitting this 
one out&#39;.  As she watched them, she resolved to focus her studies 
on this new disease.

----

&quot;What do you think they&#39;re talking about?&quot; Makoto muttered to her 
dance partner, Motoki.  

&quot;I assume you mean Ami and Mamoru,&quot; Motoko laughed.  &quot;You haven&#39;t 
taken your eyes off of her all night.&quot;

Abashed, Makoto refocused her attention on him.  &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
that&#39;s kinda rude of me, huh?  Thanks for asking me to dance.  I 
really love dancing.&quot;

&quot;I know you do.  Besides, Reika would have broken my arm if I 
hadn&#39;t asked you.  She&#39;s always kidding me about how you guys all 
had crushes on me back in school.  I can&#39;t believe I never 
noticed.&quot;

&quot;Neither could we,&quot; Makoto chuckled.  &quot;I mean, did you think we 
were over there cooking and cleaning for you just because we 
admired the way you ran that arcade?&quot;  

&quot;Well, I see that you guys are all over me now,&quot; he pointed out, 
gesturing to the other side of the ballroom where Rei and Mina 
were dancing slow together.  &quot;So, are you and she an item?&quot;

&quot;Me and who?&quot; Makoto asked, even though she knew the answer.  
Ever since she&#39;d walked into the airport terminal and seen Ami 
standing there, she hadn&#39;t been able to get the blue-haired cutie 
out of her head.  After that initial exchange of letters, they 
had gotten into the habit of emailing each other regularly, even 
calling once in a while.  Despite the distance, they had grown 
even closer than they had been back in Tokyo.  If Ami had been 
her best friend then, and she had been, she had evolved into 
something way beyond that now.  In fact, Makoto realized she 
couldn&#39;t even imagine life without Ami anymore.  None of that, 
however, had prepared her for the way she&#39;d felt when she saw Ami 
in person again.  

Motoki refused to answer her silly question, instead raising an 
eyebrow at her expectantly.  

&quot;Fine, I know who you mean and no, we&#39;re not an item.  We&#39;re..&quot;  
She had been about to say &#39;just friends&#39; but the words died in 
her throat.  She and Motoki were &#39;just friends&#39;.   She and the 
other senshi were &#39;best friends&#39;.   She and Ami had grown into 
something indefinable.  

&quot;Is she not interested in you like that?&quot; Motoki asked 
sympathetically.  

&quot;No, I mean yes,&quot; Makoto sputtered.  &quot;I think she was, maybe she 
is... it&#39;s complicated.&quot;  

&quot;You should talk to her about it,&quot; he suggested carefully.  &quot;One 
thing Reika and I have learned is the importance of talking about 
our feelings.&quot;

Makoto sought out Ami in the crowd once again.  &#39;She looks 
upset,&#39; she thought, worrying suddenly. &quot;I think you&#39;re right, 
but we&#39;re both flying out tomorrow.&quot;  

&quot;I know you&#39;re making good money in that new job.  Why don&#39;t you 
plan a trip to go visit her?&quot;

&quot;I guess I could do that,&quot; Makoto realized.  &quot;Even counting this 
trip, I still have a lot of vacation stored up and Ami&#39;s spring 
break isn&#39;t too far away...&quot;  With a dreamy smile on her face, 
she began planning, her thoughts a million miles away.  Motoki 
grinned and left her alone with her dreams as they finished their 
dance.

--------

They had both slept on the plane, each trying to get as much rest 
as possible after grueling travel and before what was surely 
going to be a very busy week.   

They had sat together at the party, chatting with everyone else 
but each other, but never moving more than a few feet apart.

They had spent the wedding side by side, watching two of their 
dearest friends formalize their lifelong commitment, lost in a 
tumult of mixed feelings and confused emotions.  

And now, at the reception, they had come together to dance 
without saying a word, until...

&quot;I&#39;m over her, Mina-chan.&quot;

The sudden explosion of sound, even if it was just a whisper, 
shook Mina out of her trance.  It took a moment for her to recall 
where she was, lost as she had been in the feel of Rei&#39;s arms 
around her waist, the smell of her hair, the sound of her 
heartbeat.  It took another moment for the meaning of the words 
to sink in.  &quot;Are you sure, Rei-chan?&quot;

Rei laid her head against Mina&#39;s hair, marveling at how soft it 
felt against her bare skin.  Since she&#39;d been away from home, 
working on her own, Rei had had a lot of time to consider many 
things.  Absence had indeed made the heart grow fonder, as Rei 
had found herself missing all of her friends and appreciating 
them much more than she had ever guessed she would.  However, 
absence had also provided some clarity.   When surrounded by all 
of her friends, they had sometimes seemed to be a single unit.  
While away from them, however, her feelings towards them as 
individuals had grown more distinct.   Though Rei missed all of 
her friends and did her best to keep in touch with each of them, 
it was Minako who she had missed the most.  It was Minako with 
whom she had shared every detail of her life abroad.  It was 
Minako who she had called late in the night, when she needed to 
hear a friendly voice.  

&quot;I&#39;m sure, Mina-chan.&quot;

Minako settled back down, but did not allow herself to be swept 
away by the moment again.  Instead, she pondered once again the 
topic that had dominated her thoughts over the last few days, if 
not the last few years.  She and Rei had grown so much closer 
over the last year, but she had steeled herself to think of Rei 
only as a friend.  True, there had been a number of ambiguities 
the last, and only, time they&#39;d discussed their feelings for one 
another.  She had left Rei that day with hope, hope that in time 
Rei could come to feel for her the same way she felt for Rei.  
Waiting would have driven her mad, though, so Minako had trained 
herself to put those thoughts aside.  As the Spanish said, &quot;What 
could be, should be&quot;, or something like that.  Now, with Rei&#39;s 
arms wrapped tight around her, all of those feelings were rushing 
back to the surface.  Mina knew now that she&#39;d never stopped 
loving Rei.  On the contrary, she loved her more now than ever.  

&quot;Rei-chan...&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;I know you&#39;re very busy with work, but I was wondering.  Would 
you like to visit me on tour?  I&#39;m playing in Indonesia and then 
Australia over the next couple months and I&#39;d love for you to 
come see me perform.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d like that, Mina-chan,&quot; Rei said quietly.  Usagi, the first 
love of her life, had just pledged herself for all eternity to 
the guy who had been her first official boyfriend, but all Rei 
could think of was the touch of Mina&#39;s skin where her hands met 
behind her neck.  She couldn&#39;t remember the last time she&#39;d been 
so happy.  &quot;I&#39;d like that very much.&quot;
