<p><u>“<em>Tell me no lies…xi”</em></u></p>
<p>It started out as a day  filled with the unknown. The kind of unknown that was wrought with  anticipation berthed at heralding of a new day. Beginning as meager  tingles of electricity, something…was going to happen, they all tasted  it in the air. The day progressed in amazing cinematic fashion;  screenplay writers couldn’t have imagined a better romantic feature  than this. Two friends, lost in the swirl of time, reunited – getting <em>reacquainted</em>.</p>
<p>Suddenly…</p>
<p>They shared a single breath….</p>
<p>…sandwiched between heated….</p>
<p>…Searing….</p>
<p>….Kisses and ravenous touches.</p>
<p>Among  the hushed whispers of want, emotions were brought to the brink; not  only for the participants but for the observers as well, for one  anyway. Makoto peered upwards and was met with deep and reverberating  chocolate orbs. She had remembered being on the receiving end of Rei’s  gaze once before. They were at odds then over Usagi’s study habits – or  lack there of . There were no doubts in Makoto’s mind, she and the fire  priestess will be at odds again.</p>
<p>“…Let me guess, you had to hold her hand for her to use the toilet, Makoto. Such a friend.”</p>
<p>Rei’s voice was unnervingly calm. Uneasiness settled over everyone.</p>
<p>Makoto  began to untangle herself from Usagi who, with the aid of the now knelt  Minako, began to whine piteously, complaining of her bruised knees. She  had noticed that Usagi did all she could to keep her eyes averted from  the heated miko. Lifting herself from the pile-up the tallest one time  senshi of Thunder, dusted herself free of debris before easing herself  between Rei and Usagi – an added distance from Rei’s hands wrapping  about Usagi’s slender throat. A familiar thought that often traversed  Makoto’s mind.</p>
<p>The miko canted her head as her eyes swept to read  Makoto’s features, thusly met with a soft reply from her friend, “…It’s  not her fault.”</p>
<p>“Guilty?”</p>
<p>“….Don’t you start, Rei.”</p>
<p>“I’m not the one sneaking behind my<em> friend’s</em> back…am I,” It was a comment, an unforgiving one.</p>
<p>She couldn’t just stand there and take the ‘blame’, but in hindsight, she <em>should</em> have. Makoto’s ire had risen, angered with a touch of embarrassment for  having been found and even more so being on the receiving end of Rei’s  stark, accusatory aloofness. Her hair follicles felt as if they were on  fire while her skin tingled with warmth – Was this how it was for the  priestess? Feeling that uncontrolled rage?</p>
<p>“If <em>you</em> just stopped playing this <em>stupid</em> – ‘Woe-is-me’ game, we wouldn’t have to…”</p>
<p>“What, Makoto?” injected Rei venomously, “Butt into <em>my</em> own business?” Her eyes swam with near double vision as her own  simmering anger boiled to a climax. Rei darted her gaze towards Usagi,  “What the <em>hell</em> did you think you were doing? I <em>was</em> handling things just FINE.”</p>
<p>Usagi recoiled into herself as soon as the rage was directed unto her.</p>
<p>“Right,” spat Makoto, coming to the aid of her princess, “SO fine that you were going to give up your <em>virginity</em> to someone who’s already <em>with</em> someone else, lacking <em>morals</em> much, priestess? Though…you wouldn’t have a problem with it, would you. Seeing how <em>you’re</em> really not with anyone, right?”</p>
<p>Minako furrowed her brow in askance letting her confused gaze dance from Usagi, Makoto…and finally, Rei, “…What?”</p>
<p>Usagi’s  breath fizzled from her lungs, deflating herself immeasurably, begging  the tall brunette to stop under bated breath. Makoto clenched her teeth  before realizing that the slew of words, were being spewed from her  lips. She couldn’t bite them back. But on the same token – there was a  sense of satisfaction at drawing first blood from the temperamental  miko before her.</p>
<p>Red clouded her gaze, as the heat of shame  crawled over her earlobes. Rei hadn’t expected for her falsification to  stutter out like this, in the heat of an unsuspected confrontation.  With a <em>trusted </em>friend no less…</p>
<p>Makoto didn’t know how to stop, despite <em>knowing</em> she should. “Oh…did she fail to tell you Minako-chan? I’m sure she did.  After all, her mouth was busy with other things. About Isabelle Rose…”</p>
<p>Minako  gently rested her hand on Rei’s shoulder, in an attempt to bring the  fiery priestess back; for the miko…the weight alone of the Songbird’s  grasp decimated her resolve, but her following words spiraled Rei into  nothingness.</p>
<p>“…Did…did you <em>lie </em>to me…Rei?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, she did, Minako-chan,” continued Makoto, treading further into dangerous territory, “<em>Isabelle Rose </em>was <em>made…</em>”</p>
<p>Before  the final syllable was uttered, Makoto’s head had snapped to the right.  The impact didn’t hurt her, not in the beginning because of the  adrenaline being pumped through her veins. But as she cupped her cheek  the dull throb began to overwhelm Makoto’s initial shock. Her cheek was  burning and she felt the underlying tissue begin to grow taut – a  bruise will soon form, she knew it. Makoto had been in one too many  fights in her long gone childhood to not know the symptoms. Up until  that point…the confrontation was a blur – but it was then that  everything came into clarity.</p>
<p>Usagi and Minako’s voices were  distant, but she could tell they were stricken with utter panic, their  hands helped to steady her. Hazel colored eyes glistened with saline as  they affixed on the miko’s back, witnessing the raven headed woman  hurriedly leaving the restroom – no more words were needed.</p>
<p>Rei’s  arms had been tucked into her body as the biting cold of winter’s  breath bathed a lonely welcome once she stepped from the warmth of the  restroom. She hobbled along picking up her pace with nary a second  glance backward to the others. Rei nursed not only her wounded pride,  but her leg…and now…the back of her hand which stung mercilessly. She  had to admit the outcome was something she hoped to attain.</p>
<p>Makoto had finally shut her mouth.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>His  day finally ended as soon as he clicked off the illumination for his  Taxi services. Now…he could finally return to the more important  aspects of his livelihood.</p>
<p>Being close to his Fiery Angel.</p>
<p>The <em>watcher</em> hunted and found her at this absurd monkey-like atmosphere of course  his white lie to that imbecilic owner of the Crown helped his search  for her. It was along the lines of…returning to his Angel, a purse that  was left in his cab. Gratefully, without need of more convincing the  Crown owner pointed him <em>here</em>. Bewildered as to <em>why</em> she would be here, his answer came as a surprise. His Angel had an engagement with a stickly looking woman. <em>A friend.</em> No immediate threat…</p>
<p>He  waited. Patiently. There would be a time where his Angel would be left  alone. Then he would ask her again to share a day with him and he  alone. But it never came. she was stuck, probably against her will,  alongside that anorexic tart. And it upset him.</p>
<p>Then his patience, though worn thin was assuaged, because….<em>there, </em>she finally appeared. Done with the necessities of the restroom his Angel hobbled out. She looked different…upset.</p>
<p><em>Who would do that to you, my Angel…</em></p>
<p>Absently  he saw her rankle her way towards the Taxi stand. Fate had brought them  together once more. Tearing himself from the comfort of his vehicle,  the lanky man plowed his way towards <em>his</em> intended…He had to hurry to <em>rescue </em>her, because none to soon…that thin slut of a woman his Angel was with, tore from the ladies’ restroom.</p>
<p>He  was behind her now, not only many times her senior, but he towered over  her, in effect blocking his Angel from prying eyes. Tentatively, his  fingertips reached out…drumming gently against the small of her back.  It was enough.</p>
<p>Rei whirled about, her eyes shone with irritance then instant recognition. “Ishikawa-san. What are you…?”</p>
<p>“Working, miss. You need a ride, yes?”</p>
<p>Even  among the shrilly yowls of excitable children about her, the tinny of  Minako’s voice was heard. A distant tickle blanketing her ears. She  couldn’t face her…Not now, maybe not even ever. Daring not to look  towards the source of those desperate cries of her name, begging her to  come back, Rei’s jaw set looking towards the cabbie.</p>
<p>“Yes…<em>yes</em>…”</p>
<p>“Where to,” he managed to contain his excitement. His Angel recognized him!</p>
<p>“…Just take me the <em>hell</em> away from here.”</p>
<p>At  her command, he whisked her towards his cab. Saving her from this  existence. Now would be the time, Kami willed it so, time for him to  confess <em>everything</em> to her. No woman had ever held this type of sway over him…</p>
<p>Not like his <em>Fiery Angel.</em></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>“So - where the <em>fuck</em> is she.”</p>
<p>The  novelty wore out perhaps…an hour, or maybe two, ago – and he swore  under his breath if Minako hadn’t hurried herself up, there would be a  pile of mountainous flesh smattered all over the floor of this rather, <em>pretty</em> stage. Not his flesh, obviously. Terry Lapps wouldn’t know how to kill  a roach if he had to. Terry was just one tightly wound muscle of  tension. Pity, it could have been eased with just one romp with the  pianist – hetero men never knew what they were missing.</p>
<p>Zoicite  though, remained composed. Lazily he twirled a singular strand of his  immaculate silver mop about his index finger mockingly mouthing Terry’s  incessant, linear demands. Exhaling softly, the pianist slighted his  head towards the left, lifting his ghostly orbs to the handsome  football player.</p>
<p>“School must have been difficult for you.”, oozed the maestro effortlessly.</p>
<p>Rubbing  the nape of his neck, Terry gave pause, he surpassed that particular  patience threshold. Not that he had any for anyone else, sans Minako.  With tongue in cheek, the wide receiver drew his lofty frame ram-rod  stiff, burrowing his eyes on to the flaming idiot before him.</p>
<p>“Suckin’ on too much spooge, Fairy – th’ hell you talkin’ ‘bout?”</p>
<p>“It does a Boi’s body good, no?” A smirk, “Now there’s the difference, my American toy – maybe you need to <em>suck</em> your own fair share? May help with your memories, because they’re shot  to bloody hell, love.” Tiredly Zoicite added, “But because your mind is  equivalent to that of a Squid’s, I shall reiterate…Minako’s at a  meeting…”</p>
<p>“Ain’t no <em>meeting</em> that lasts this long, you’re lyin’. Try <em>again</em>,” sniped Terry.</p>
<p>Crisp  clacks echoed on the stage, and a voice rang out – it was ragged,  anxiety stricken, “He may be a few things, but a liar, is not one of  them…it <em>just</em> ended, Terry.” Minako’s eyes slipped onto her long time archrival and <em>brother</em>, “Thank you Zoicite – for keeping him company.”</p>
<p>“The pleasure was <em>all</em> mine, honey. Curiosity bites me though – How’d your meeting go?” questioned the silver haired man with much mirth.</p>
<p>She prepared herself for it. At least Minako thought she did – the Songbird <em>knew</em> it was coming. It was just the nature of the beast for a curios fellow  like Zoicite. But amongst busying herself with gathering her things,  her haphazard grasp caused a plethora of papers to spill and pool about  her feet, “it…was a meeting.”</p>
<p>“Oh how vague. Good, bad?…<em>Intense</em>?”</p>
<p>Minako’s  mind flashed to Rei’s assaulting lips. God, how she craved them over  her flesh again. Her hands shook at the next memory. Her would-be lover  lashed out at Makoto, blemishing their friend’s face with one blow.</p>
<p>Then there was the lie.</p>
<p>Was  it hurt she was feeling? Or was it pure…astonishment. Her countenance  must have portrayed a different tale to Rei. Because in that instant  the woman ran from her, again. That arrested Minako and knifed her  deeper than the calculated lie. Actions spoke louder than words, so the  ancient cliché went. Rei’s action suggested…this pursuit was nothing  but a flight of fancy blessed with little idle touches. A passing lover  – something she should be used to. But…Minako had to have more than  just…<em>this</em> affair.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan?” prompted Zoicite.</p>
<p>“…I’ll have to meet one more time with <em>her</em>. There were things we hadn’t met eye to eye about,” she hurriedly said, breaking from her reverie.</p>
<p>The silver haired maestro wasn’t the <em>only</em> one hanging on Minako’s every word. Terry caught the slip, even when  the singer wasn’t aware of her absent-minded mistake. Pulling himself  from the shadows cast ominously on the stage, the Football star stopped  short at Minako’s back; he found his thick digits raking through the  singer’s silk, hair.</p>
<p>“If you had the time, baby, maybe – But…you  don’t,” murmured Terry. Minako could have sworn there was a trace of  poison surfing between the words he uttered.</p>
<p>Minako’s throat  constricted, skimming her eyes over Zoicite who was every bit as  discombobulated as she was, “Honey…” she tested delicately in her  wavering American English, “If you’re worried about the concert…  there’s plenty of time, I can schedule my meetings between rehearsals  and,”</p>
<p>Terry laughed as he brought his petting to a halt,  interrupting Minako’s words, “That’s funny babe,” he began  sarcastically, “But your manager agreed with me when I spoke with him  earlier t’day; y’ain’t had enough rehearsal time, especially now with  the concert’s date being moved up from the end of the month to next  weekend, we’re leaving the week after,” paused Terry.</p>
<p>Minako blankly looked to her lover.</p>
<p>“What? Why so soon? I can’t just up and leave, Terry that’s impossible – I …I have things I need to <em>finish</em>, that need…m-my attention”</p>
<p>“Can’t be that important, otherwise…you wouldn’t be <em>here</em>, right now…with me, just like you <em>promised</em> you would be.”</p>
<p>Terry started to trace the thought-lines coursing over Minako’s brow. It was her chance to answer, to tell him. What exactly?</p>
<p><em>I…have to know…she haunts me…I can’t stop…</em></p>
<p><em>I can’t love you…don’t force me to love you…</em></p>
<p>But her voice was muted. Nothing worked in her.</p>
<p>The truth of it was they had made a life together and somewhere in her, she still cared deeply for Terry. Just <em>what</em> was she trying to prove here? Who was she proving herself to?</p>
<p><em>Rei</em>.</p>
<p>Would she risk everything she’s built for herself for the <em>unknown…</em>For a woman that runs hot and cold in tandem, could she live with the unpredictability?</p>
<p>When no answer came, Terry grunted, tugging her attentions back to where they belonged, with him…<em>To</em> him.</p>
<p>He  smiled fleetingly, gripping the back of Minako’s head firm and tugging  it backward; till to what Zoicite observed, was liken to that of an  erotic portrait of a dominant master to his slave. Minako’s body was  positioned on her knees; her hair swept up in a fist and gripped by the  Football player. Her back arched as he lowered his head to impart a  ferocious kiss on her.</p>
<p>The silver haired pianist immediately  darted from his seat, knowing exactly what Terry was doing. He knew  that Terry hoped to have tasted the betrayal of whoever Minako had met  with, still clinging to the Singer’s lips.</p>
<p>Peeling himself from  his prone girlfriend, the hulking male opened his eyes, letting his  calloused thumb beat for a few moments over Minako’s lower lip,  “Vanilla.” He announced gruffly, “Different <em>taste</em>,” he paused and softly said. “C’mon, get up...time for me, to take care of you.”</p>
<p>The  Football star was livid, Minako knew. He had never lifted a hand to  her, never really rose his voice to her, but by his set jaw, furrowed  brow and lowered voice he was suffering in quiet repose. Hurt and anger  stationed in her young lover. Guilt traveled mercilessly through the  Singer.</p>
<p>With that uttered, Terry hefted Minako to her feet. She  had about as much mobility as a rag-doll, noted Zoicite. In nothing  less than a batting of an eye, he had witnessed the Singer relinquish  herself again to the player’s subtle manipulative whim. To him, it was  worse than a physical abuse. At least physically…one had the chance to  recover. Emotionally, the scar would be deeply rooted and would last  for a lifetime. He would know. He had given everything of himself to  one man in his life. But the affection remained of that comparative to  an owner loving his pet dog so his loyalty and love was rewarded with a  Scooby Snack.</p>
<p>He won’t see that happen to his <em>sister</em>.</p>
<p>“Minako,” iterated Zoicite firmly, yet musically, “Why don’t we <em>girls</em> have us a slumber, mm? It’s been much too long since we’ve tittered away…come with?”</p>
<p>“…She’s not up for it, Fruit-Fly,” stated Terry flatly.</p>
<p>“My GOD man, had I known you wanted to have gender reassignment, I would have recommended a <em>fabulous</em> doctor to you,” a pause, “…You, though, really should clean out those ears of yours Hercules, I was talking to Mina-chan. Be <em>somewhat</em> of a good boy, and let <em>her</em> answer…” Zoicite gutturally mewled out before slighting his gaze towards Minako.</p>
<p>She  inwardly winced at the sudden tightening on her hand. Terry immediately  let her know his feelings. Minako’s mind cartwheeled to catch up with  her mouth to no avail. It was an automatic response, precision  practiced and delivered with sincerity and a splash of regret. A  perfect stew of lies.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry, I already have something planned for tonight. Raincheck?”</p>
<p>Zoicite  heard the same line one too many times; with each delivery of it he  just shook his head in disdain and acquiesced. This time he simply  burrowed his gaze onto Minako speaking crisply,</p>
<p>“When you finally break those strings, <em>puppet</em>…Call me.”</p>
<p>Almost  whispered, but none the less enunciated, announced and left to ponder  on. Zoicite then turned on his planted heel and exited the dimly lit  stage.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>She had been home for only a couple of minutes and  was greeted with the obnoxious ringing of her telephone. Her head  tilted comfortably nestling her ear against the earpiece. A repeat  performance from earlier in the day; she listened with absolute  patience to her friend’s frantic regaling of what occurred naught but  an hour or so ago.</p>
<p>“…As long as it’s been iced she’ll hurt less.”</p>
<p>“<em>Ami-chan! Didn’t you just hear what I said?”</em> pleaded the now hoarsely voiced woman.</p>
<p>“Every word, Usagi-chan.”</p>
<p>“<em>And?”</em></p>
<p>“This is the effect of your meddling…the <em>both</em> of you should have realized there would be consequences.”</p>
<p>A dejected, regretful sigh was imparted, <em>“I know…I know…”</em></p>
<p>Ami  left the comfort of her plush seat, unhooking her sandals. Normally,  she would have been a bit more compulsive in how her wears were  scattered about her apartment. But since her breakup with a certain  uppity man, Ami hadn’t felt the need to be particularly anal about  herself. No one was watching. Not that anyone ever watched the good  girl. Even to her best friends had labeled her in some way, be it  voiced or subtle.</p>
<p>Quiet.</p>
<p>Steadfast.</p>
<p>Brilliant.</p>
<p>All  those monikers were well founded. Perhaps that’s why no one really  noticed the change that berthed in the woman. She thought herself  resolute, independent…a woman that had grown out of her shell. In that,  she still loved when her friends ran to her – it gave her…a nice power  complex. A sin – prideful one at that. Despite growing as a person  though, there are certain aspects in her life she would have rather  shared with that <em>someone</em> special.</p>
<p>Nephrite wasn’t that  person. A scoff rang in her inner mind – How she ever came to align  herself with him, was purely to quell those teenaged hormones,  granted…he was <em>passionate</em> where peeping eyes were never meant  to spy. Brooding, temperamental…he made for a lacking lover,  emotionally. Ami had been glad she had ended it. She was done with  trifling with the trials of love. It was… a waste of time. She hoped,  at least…</p>
<p>“…<em>Where do you think she…hold on Ami…” </em>The phone  had gone muffled, but not completely so as she then heard nondescript  sounds tumbling from the earpiece. Apparently, Motoki-kun hadn’t taken  kindly to the fact that his fiancé looked as is she ran into Rei’s fist  no more than 5 times – without putting up a fight. Usagi returned  sounding out of breath.</p>
<p>“...I take it Motoki-kun’s a little upset?”</p>
<p>“<em>Slightly, can you imagine him wanting to duel Rei-chan?”</em></p>
<p>Ami chuckled.</p>
<p>“<em>Exactly. Mako-chan’s trying to calm him now,” </em>explained  Usagi. Ami heard her friend shuffle off to an adjoining room no less,  as she, helped herself to a flute of wine which had been calling her  name ever since this day began. <em>“…Anyway.”</em></p>
<p>The doctor  swirled her glass breathing in the alcohol, before sipping it  languidly. Sparing a glance to her veiled windows, Ami noted a set of  distorted, yet glaring lights cut through the gloom of the suddenly  rainy day. Moving her way towards her window, the demure woman pushed  her curtains back. Pressed against the side of a cab someone was in the  rain, soaked to the bone, looking directly at her maybe even <em>through </em>her. Her body involuntarily quaked from the weight of those haunting eyes.</p>
<p>“…<em>Ami-chan? You broke up for a little there, did you hear me?”</em></p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>Ami quickly set her flute aside, her hand tentatively gripped her brass door knob. All those little nerves from her <em>old</em> self quarreled forth. For no apparent reason. Or…was there? Turning the knob, the door moaned open.</p>
<p>“…<em>Well? Would you have any idea where Rei-chan would have run to?”</em></p>
<p>This  had been the second time she had felt any worth to herself, ironically  it had been the day she ran away, to the Crown with the very person  that now graced her doorstep. Meeting her visitor’s gaze, Ami moved  from the doorway, giving wide entry to the woman before her.</p>
<p>“…No, I’m sorry Usagi-chan, I can’t help you,” answered Ami.</p>
<p>“<em>Ah…soo…well…” click </em></p>
<p>She tossed the now silent cordless phone onto the nearest empty lounge seat. Quietly, Ami closed the door to her apartment.</p>
<p>“You  hung up on her.” There was a sort of underlying hint of laughter  clinging on the raven headed woman’s dulcet tone. It caused the  slightly younger woman to afford a shy smile to dance over her lips.</p>
<p>“Hai,”  softly replied the doctor. She lifted her gaze. Ami’s simple movement  drew her companion’s attention on to her. “She’ll forgive me in time.  Or forget. Either way – I’m not in <em>that </em>much trouble. But I can’t say the same for you…”</p>
<p>“…My hand hurts.”</p>
<p>Ami nodded slowly. “I’ve always known Mako-chan had thick bone structure,” chuckled the demure woman.</p>
<p>Rei  shrugged, still cradling her hand. She seemed transfixed at the sudden  coloring of her knuckles; idly the miko prodded at her flesh, wincing  each time. It was that whole psychological surreal aspect. Rei couldn’t  believe she had done what she did, pressing on the injury made the  woman realize the gravity of it all.</p>
<p>“It was instinctive,”  quipped Rei quietly, “Makoto wouldn’t shut her mouth…and Minako…”,  desperately her fingers flexed, working their circulation all the while  throbbing with sharp pains.</p>
<p>“Dwelling on this, will bring you nothing more than <em>what ifs</em>…so don’t do it. It happened. And the <em>now</em> is here…what will you do <em>now?</em>”</p>
<p>“I don’t need this cryptic bullshit, Ami.”</p>
<p>“And  I won’t spoon feed your brattyness,” came Ami’s insipid reply. Rei was  mute. No surprise. But the look in the miko’s gaze sung volumes. The  raven haired goddess was impressed with Ami’s sudden ironhide.</p>
<p>The  once senshi of wisdom wended her way towards her adjacently placed  kitchen, she felt Rei’s gaze touch her for a moment before that  sensation of being watched, faded. Signaling the woman that it was all  right to let loose the breath that was held in her lungs. Ami grabbed  an insta-cold pack from her freezer, then, returned to her guest  lobbing the iced object onto Rei’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p>“Arigato.”</p>
<p>“Have you decided?”</p>
<p>Rei  turned her head from Ami. For what seemed like an eternity the silence  was drawn out. She buried her face into the netting of her palm and  fingers. A hollow, depressed laced voice echoed in the room. It pleaded  with Ami for some sort of deliverance.</p>
<p>“…I…I want her Ami. I can’t get rid of her touch, I can’t <em>not</em> breathe without her, but the way she looked at me and asked if…I lied…”  she paused for only a beat, exhaling, “God…her smell…her kisses…<em>everything.</em>”</p>
<p>The  doctor had been glad she was drinking, it not only kept her warm from  the stabbing instances of cold, but it helped to numb her. Her mind  free fell back to a time that conveyed pure innocence under the guise  of teen rebelliousness. They were barely breaking into their prime  teenaged years, but as it stood it’s always been engrained for every  burgeoning youth reaching that time in their lives to be angst ridden.</p>
<p>Ami  had attained a point that her sterile relationship with her mother  began to degrade. She was the child of one of Japan’s more prominent  medical citizens. Expectations were imminent. Till the day, that is –  Ami had begun running with an uncouth band of girls. She needed to make  a choice. Living up to her mother’s desires or…her own. So Ami chose.</p>
<p>And  she ran into an ally. Someone SO different from her it was like Ice and  Fire trying to coexist in the same room – a very small room, they had  nothing in common. Rei had an estranged relationship with her father,  quite honestly, the miko looked as if she had strained relationships  with anyone that came into contact with her…</p>
<p>The day came when the <em>Crown</em> served more than <em>just</em> a meeting place. It became a safe haven and home. It was here also,  that Fire and Ice joined. It was amazing for Ami, to have found a  special kinship with Hino Rei. They shared a night with no inhibitions  between them. Ami learned to be a teenager then, as she’s sure Rei did  as well. Because soon after, a quiet understanding developed - berthed  by being at the side of the miko that night.</p>
<p>But it came to pass  that Aino Minako – the supreme idol, had wedged herself into Rei’s  soul. It was also Aino Minako, that shattered it at the same time. And  it stood true that Aino Minako, simply ruled the globe with just a  tendered flash of that cupid lipped smile.</p>
<p><em>Some girls…have all the luck.</em></p>
<p>“...Does she feel the same? Could you look past the lust and <em>find</em> what you want reciprocated in <em>her</em> eyes?”</p>
<p>Rei  glanced over her shoulder briefly towards the composed doctor, nursing  a near empty goblet of red wine. Immediately, her mind reeled to <em>that</em> moment – Minako begged her breathlessly. She was wanton. The burning, the need…it <em>was</em> real. But…</p>
<p>Rei looked away.</p>
<p>“I… don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Soo.”</p>
<p>“Are you that <em>against</em> me, Ami,” softly replied Rei. Ami didn’t provide her answer.</p>
<p>With  her head hung low, the miko failed to realize her friend and confidant  ghosted her way from her seat. Ami crossed the carpeting with little or  no sound, effortlessly. So with that, her splayed fingertips pushed  back the curtain of hair from Rei’s face, tucking a healthy swath of  her bangs behind an ear. But grasped within her freed hand, Ami offered  the remnants of her bottled reserve of Chilean wine.</p>
<p>Rei’s eyes stung with a familiar saline wetness and her hands almost too eagerly snatched the bottle from Ami, “new drug?”</p>
<p>“Revolutionary prescription. As your attending physician – I suggested you take it.”</p>
<p>Ami  unceremoniously plopped herself alongside Rei as she drank. She  chuckled as the woman’s face screwed up while the warmth of the liquor  coursed Rei’s slender throat. Gently the doctor reached over and pulled  the rim of the bottle from the miko’s cherry colored lips, “Easy,  slowly…there…”</p>
<p>“warm…”</p>
<p>“Hai, helps to…whittle away the cold.”</p>
<p>Unused  to the induction of alcohol in her system, Rei began to slip into the  effects of the drug. Her limbs grew heavy while her lips tingled, yet  ached for another swig. Wrestling the bottle from Ami’s laxed grip, Rei  down another healthy swallow, in effect…polishing off the remains. The  miko’s rage suddenly sparked alive, consuming her. Rei’s grip about the  bottle’s neck grew taut. Barely a fluttering of an eye counted the tick  of time as then…the wine bottle was sent hurtling through the air,  smashing itself against Ami’s bureau. The impact toppled a black  lacquered group picture of the five women. The doctor…hardly cringed;  she expected this reaction.</p>
<p>Soft sobs tore past Rei’s lips, babbling a raggedly pieced apology. “I…don’t know what the <em>fuck</em> I’m doing Ami…I don’t know…”</p>
<p>By  her very fingertips, Ami feathered the pads of her digits along Rei’s  forearm, beckoning the miko just by mere touch, to her side. Dizzied  from the effects of wine Rei’s body still craved that warmth that only  a body can give. Listlessly, her form melded to Ami’s side. Arms  encased the priestess until she felt her head nestle at the crook of  the doctor’s neck and shoulder. Rei felt her lips move, and didn’t  realize the words that tumbled from her, until she listened.</p>
<p>“…Why…why are you ag…<em>against</em> me Ami-chan? Not…not good for her…enough - good enough <em>for</em> her,” Rei repeated in a haze.</p>
<p>Little  more than a feathered brush of Ami’s lips to her temple was barely  noticeable to Rei. She just knew that it was a comforting feeling;  knowing that she wasn’t alone. And just before Morpheous spoke  whispered lullabies, Ami’s gentle prose poked through her dampened  senses.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I’m against you and <em>she.</em>”</p>
<p>Rei mumbled her reply, Ami chuckled and continued to coo, trailing her fingernails through the miko’s hair.</p>
<p>“…I’m against you…getting hurt.”</p>
<p>“But…I…l..love…<em>her.</em>”</p>
<p>“I  know,” paused Ami, “I’ve always known…as I know – you’ll risk  everything just to be with her. But tonight, let it be me. She’ll have  you…every other day, Rei-chan. – just let me…”</p>
<p>Ami glanced to her companion, comrade in arms…friend, who fell fast asleep – and softly, her confession trembled from her lips.</p>
<p>“…have this night.”</p>
