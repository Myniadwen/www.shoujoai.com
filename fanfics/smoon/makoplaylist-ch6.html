<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p class="p1"><i>Ring… ring… ring…</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Moshi moshi. Kino Makoto desu.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good afternoon Makochan!” exclaimed Usagi at the other end.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hi Usachan… What time is it?” Makoto was still sleepy after doing some paper 
works for the café and she just slept before dawn.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s already 1pm. Are you doing anything a day after tomorrow? Haruka and 
Michiru is throwing a pool party for all of us at Michiru’s house. Please come Makochan! 
<i>Please!!!!</i>” pleaded Usagi,</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know my Queen. I’ll think about it. Can I call you back?” Makoto 
asked half awake half asleep.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Awww… Makochan… Please come. Minachan will be leaving two days after 
tomorrow for England. It will be our last day with her this summer. So you should 
definitely think about it ok?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Minachan is leaving for England? Why?” Makoto was fully awake now.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She said she has to. Her mom and dad asked her to see some universities 
there. Will you bring some food for the party? How about some cake? Or we could barbeque or 
something.” Usagi said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Why didn’t she tell me she was leaving? When did I last talk to her 
anyway? And why didn’t Rei tell me?</i> Makoto was pissed. She was lightly banging her head 
on the bed’s head board.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Makochan, are you still there?” asked Usagi.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh yes… Sorry. I was just thinking of something. Sure I’ll go. I’ll prepare 
some food at Michiru’s house. I’ll get her permission to cook there.” Makoto answered 
trying to calm down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yey! Ok Makochan! Thanks. I’ll call the others. Take care.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ok. Bye.” And Makoto hung up.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">…….</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure you don’t want to tell Makochan about you leaving for England 
for the summer?” asked Rei as she cleaned the dishes after they ate lunch. Minako went to 
the shrine to talk to the miko. Minako brought Jupiter and was hugging it.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t know Rei. And besides, I tried to tell her a couple of times for the 
past few days but she wasn’t listening.” Minako answered.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You do know that she loves you, right?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I do Rei but I need to hear it from her. And I know you all know I love her 
as well. I just have to talk to my parents about this before I do anything. I just want to 
make sure about everything.” Minako answered then she sighed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then Rei’s cellphone rang.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Moshi moshi Hino Rei desu.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why the fuck didn’t you tell me that Minachan’s leaving for England two days 
after tomorrow?!?” Makoto was shouting at the other side of the line.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei almost dropped the phone. Minako winced and squeezed Jupiter after 
hearing Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Calm down you amazon!” Rei shouted back.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“How could I calm down?!? She’s leaving, Rei! She’s going to England. 
England, Rei. ENGLAND!!! And I haven’t done anything! What if she went to college there?!? 
I don’t have enough money to follow her there! All of my money is on that freaking café!” 
Makoto seemed like she was fighting back tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei sighed. Minako could still hear Makoto shouting on the other line. The 
miko gestured to Minako to keep quiet and turned the cell to speaker phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She tried to tell you a couple of times you know.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She did?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yup. She said you didn’t even talk to her after she told you. She said you 
were so preoccupied with the paper work or you just didn’t care.” Rei was having a hard 
time talking to the brunette because music was blaring at the background. Minako rested her 
head at Jupiter’s fur.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I shouldn’t love you but I want to</p>
<p class="p3">I just cant turn away</p>
<p class="p3">I shouldn’t see you but I can’t move</p>
<p class="p3">I can’t look away</p>
<p class="p3">And I don’t know how to be fine when I’m not</p>
<p class="p3">Coz I don’t know how to make a feeling stop</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">A faint slap was heard from the other line. Makoto face palmed herself.<span 
class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako was listening intently but was still squeezing the bear really 
tightly. She knows the song that Makoto was playing at the background. She felt the pain 
Makoto was feeling.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Just hold on a little bit longer my Makochan. Please. I’ll make everything 
right for you. Trust me.</i> Minako thought.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p3">This feeling is taking control of me</p>
<p class="p3">And I can’t help it</p>
<p class="p3">I won’t sit around, I can’t let him win now</p>
<p class="p3">Thought you should know</p>
<p class="p3">I tried my best to let go of you</p>
<p class="p3">But I don’t want to</p>
<p class="p3">I just had to say it all before I go</p>
<p class="p15">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Were you just ignoring her?” asked the miko.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">It’s getting hard to be around you</p>
<p class="p3">There’s so much I can’t say</p>
<p class="p3">Do you want me to have the feelings</p>
<p class="p3">And look the other way?</p>
<p class="p3">And I don’t know how to be fine when I’m not</p>
<p class="p15">Coz I don’t know how to make a feeling stop</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I wasn’t ignoring her. I swear. It’s just that I’m really busy because of 
the café and everything. And well, you know, I already told you the reason.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p3">This feeling is taking control of me</p>
<p class="p3">And I can’t help it</p>
<p class="p3">I won’t sit around, I can’t let him win now</p>
<p class="p3">Thought you should know</p>
<p class="p3">I tried my best to let go of you</p>
<p class="p3">But I don’t want to</p>
<p class="p3">I just had to say it all before I go</p>
<p class="p15">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oh that.” Rei looked at Minako and she scribbled something on a piece paper 
then gave it to Minako. The blonde took the note and read, “I’ll tell you what we talked 
about later.” Minako nodded.</p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3">This emptiness is killing me</p>
<p class="p3">And I’m wondering why I waited so long</p>
<p class="p3">Looking back I realized it was always there</p>
<p class="p3">Just never spoken</p>
<p class="p15">I’m waiting here, been waiting here</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So are you going to the pool party? You know what, maybe you should at least 
drop your defenses on that day and just treat her the way you want to treat her. Besides, 
you won’t be able to see her for a month or two.” Rei said winking at the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I don’t want to scare her away Rei. You know that.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I know Makochan. But I suggest you should do it. At least you can’t blame 
yourself in the future. At least you tried.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p3">This feeling is taking control of me</p>
<p class="p3">And I can’t help it</p>
<p class="p3">I won’t sit around, I can’t let him win now</p>
<p class="p3">Thought you should know</p>
<p class="p3">I tried my best to let go of you</p>
<p class="p3">But I don’t want to</p>
<p class="p3">I just had to say it all before I go</p>
<p class="p15">Just so you know</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“….”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You know, you’ll be deaf by the time you turn 25 if you listen to music like 
that. Turn the volume down of the stereo for a bit.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">I just had to say it all before I go</p>
<p class="p15">Just so you know…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ummm… That’s my earphones…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“You just proved my point.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sorry.” Makoto turned off her iPod.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Just think about it Makochan. Stop being so emo already.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I’m not emo.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yes you are.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No I’m not.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako giggled and Rei tried to cover Minako’s mouth.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Is someone else there with you?</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No.” Then Rei mouthed <i>Ssshhhh! </i>at the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Are you sure?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course I’m sure. I’m the only one here Makochan. Anyway, just think about 
it.” Rei slapped Minako’s head. The blonde mouthed sorry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Okay. I’ll call you later. Oh and Rei…”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What?”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Thanks.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“No problem you emo.” Rei and Minako smiled.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto laughed then hung up the phone.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“What’s with the note? You got to talk to her about what?” Minako was still 
rubbing her head.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Then Rei started to tell Minako the story that Makoto told her at the park. 
Minako started to cry.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“The girl… The girl we saw a couple of months ago… Maybe that was the girl 
Makochan’s talked about.” Minako said while crying remembering the incident and the song 
that Makoto just played.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“So that’s why it was like she wanted to go talk to Makoto but the mom 
stopped her. The parents were also glaring at Makoto and she seemed so sad and angry at the 
same time as the car passed by us.” Minako continued.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Rei just hugged her friend together with Jupiter.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Then I’ve decided. I’ll speak to my parents about this. I have to fight for 
her.” Minako said as she wiped her tears.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s the spirit Minachan.”</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I just hope she comes to the party.” Minako said.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I hope so Minachan.”</p>
