<h1>Gravity of Love (part 13 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>&quot;There&#39;s nothing to tell.&quot;

&quot;From how Makoto and Haruka talk, I think there is.&quot;

Rei shifted, cursing the fact that the two big mouths were on the other 
side of the city. The next time she saw them...

&quot;There really isn&#39;t much, Serena.&quot;

The blonde moved to Rei&#39;s side of the couch, leaning against her. She 
turned her blue eyes up pleadingly, remembering the assassin always gave 
in when she did that. Raven hair brushed against her soft skin, making 
her shiver. Serena watched as her companion fidgeted 
uncharacteristically.

&quot;It&#39;s not worth telling.&quot;

&quot;But... I think it is.&quot;

Violet eyes searched Serena&#39;s baby blues.

&quot;You sure?&quot;

Much to Rei&#39;s dismay, the blonde resting against her nodded with a sweet 
smile. She sighed, her resolve crumbling. Noticing this, the blonde 
placed her head on Rei&#39;s shoulder. She shifted the blanket so it covered 
them both.

&quot;Where should I start then?&quot;

&quot;Hmm... how about your parents?&quot;

Rei&#39;s chest rose then fell as she let out another deep sigh.

&quot;My Dad was a politician. He was only twenty-four when he met my Mom.&quot;

Blue eyes focused on Rei&#39;s face, mesmerized by the movement of her ruby 
lips and the twinkle of her eyes.

&quot;How&#39;d they meet?&quot;

&quot;My Mom was a priestess. The shrine in Juuban had been in her family&#39;s 
possession for generations. Dad was there campaigning for his father. 
Back then he was just an aide. Somehow he found the shrine, I guess, 
because that&#39;s where they met.&quot;

---Flashback---

The lavender eyes of a young child stared at the photograph in her 
hands. She smiled as she traced the violet eyes of her mother, wondering 
once again why she didn&#39;t have her Mom&#39;s brown hair. It was so pretty 
and long, not to mention shiny. She knew she would wear the robes her 
mother wore in the picture one day. It was only a matter of time before 
her Grandpa let her become a priestess, instead of just doing chores 
around the shrine.

She turned her attention to her father in the photograph with a slight 
frown. Even though she&#39;d gotten her hair from him, he didn&#39;t seem to 
like her that much. He was never around, always visiting for an hour or 
two before getting into his car and driving away. Rei wondered why she 
couldn&#39;t make him as happy as Mom seemed to, at least from the 
photograph. She was Mommy&#39;s daughter, so that meant she should have that 
special something to make Daddy love her too.

She placed a kiss on Mommy and Daddy&#39;s faces, the glass of the frame 
cool against her lips. Rei placed the photograph back on her table 
before rushing to get to school.

---End of Flashback---

&quot;Grandpa didn&#39;t like my Dad, but Mom started dating him anyway. Mom was 
only nineteen when they married...&quot;

Serena saw the pain in Rei&#39;s eyes and braced herself. She snuggled 
against the woman.

&quot;A year later, I was born. But my Mom died in childbirth.&quot;

Lavender eyes squeezed shut. The memories she tried to keep away 
resurfaced. A small, warm hand clasped her own, a light squeeze sending 
waves of comfort through her.

&quot;My Dad disappeared. He left me with Grandpa. I grew up at the shrine, 
not really knowing Father. But I always knew I was the reason Mom died.&quot;

&quot;Oh, Rei...&quot;

Serena wished she hadn&#39;t asked. It was obvious, though Rei tried to hide 
it, that this was hurting her deeply.

&quot;I heard so many stories about Mom from Grandpa. But when I was seven, 
he fell ill. I guess he never quite recovered from losing Mom. He died a 
few months later.&quot;

---Flashback---

Rei stared at the coffin as it was slowly lowered into the ground. Never 
again would she hear her Grandpa&#39;s voice. Never again would she feel his 
strong arms around her, offering her warmth and safety.

The wind tugged on her black dress. Girls as young as her shouldn&#39;t have 
to wear black. She didn&#39;t know why, but she suddenly felt very tired.

A firm hand was placed on her shoulder. She looked up, meeting the blue 
eyes of a virtual stranger. But he was her father. She belonged with him 
now.

--- End of Flashback ---

&quot;I went to live with Dad. By then he&#39;d become a prominent politician, 
taking over after his father died. He didn&#39;t have too much for me.&quot;

Serena knew first hand what that felt like. But at such a young age? She 
had been blessed that her mother was still alive back then. Back when 
her Dad really loved her. So long ago, it seemed now.

She watched as Rei&#39;s fists clenched. The woman&#39;s narrowed eyes were 
focused on her lap. She was lost in her memories, and Serena was afraid 
to pull her from them. She knew she should. She knew she shouldn&#39;t let 
Rei go down this painful road. But she was curious, as much as she hated 
it. She wanted to know.

&quot;My father made a few powerful enemies. Two years later he was killed.&quot;

Rei still remembered the night. She&#39;d had a dance recital, which her 
father missed, of course. She&#39;d practiced so hard, hoping it would be 
one he finally came to. She made sure her outfit was perfect before 
prancing on stage with a huge grin on her face. She scanned the crowd. 
But as usual, Rei only saw the smiling face of her driver.

Ryusuke was waiting by the car with a grin when the recital ended. She 
slipped into the car without a word. During the drive home he&#39;d asked 
her the customary questions about her day and the recital. Rei hadn&#39;t 
been in the mood to talk, which her driver picked up on quickly. The 
rest of the ride had been in silence.

Ryusuke opened the car door for her once they arrived, escorting his 
young charge to the entrance of the massive house. He rang the bell a 
few times, knowing the servants were expecting them.

Rei was growing impatient as the minutes stretched on. First her father 
didn&#39;t come to the recital, now no one would open the door when they 
knew it was her? Her temper had been rising when she spotted Ryusuke 
open the door.

She turned to look into the house when she&#39;d heard her driver&#39;s 
strangled gasp. What she saw made her freeze.

Blood covered the floor, forming puddles and small streams. They 
reminded her of the river systems they&#39;d been studying at school. Lakes 
of blood were connected by rivers, flowing into each other and staining 
the white marble of the atrium floor.

She saw the body of their butler draped over the expensive 18th century 
table he spent hours polishing and dusting, his blood soaking the fine 
wood. One of the maids was bent in half on the railing of the stairs, 
her eyes wide and her face frozen in an expression of shock. Rei could 
see the hole in the middle of her forehead.

She spotted something move from the corner of her eye and before she 
could turn her head to see it better, she heard a grunt and then a loud 
thump. She slowly looked to her side to see Ryusuke lying on his back on 
the floor, his mouth opened in a silent scream. His eye had exploded 
when the bullet entered his brain from it, a faint hint of smoke rising 
from the burnt flesh.

A strong hand clamped over her mouth before she could scream. Tears fell 
from her eyes as she struggled. She felt the cold metal of a gun press 
against her temple.

&quot;The assassin that killed him took pity on me. He took me in.&quot;

Serena wrapped her arms around Rei, surprised when she didn&#39;t pull away.

&quot;He taught me everything I know. He made sure I would be strong... no 
matter what the cost.&quot;

Though her voice held the detachment of a medical textbook, Serena could 
see the bitterness in Rei&#39;s eyes. The blonde couldn&#39;t even begin to 
imagine what that must&#39;ve been like for Rei. To be trained to kill by 
the man that murdered her father and servants, by the man that ended her 
childhood and life as she knew it.

&quot;When I was 17, my mentor was killed on a mission. The client was 
furious, he&#39;d lost a lot of money.&quot;

Rei shifted, unconsciously burying her face in Serena&#39;s soft hair, 
inhaling the sweet fragrance.

&quot;So, he made me finish the job. If I failed... I was his.&quot;

Serena shivered. His.

&quot;I did it, though. The client was upset I managed to do so, and beat me 
until I was nearly dead. That&#39;s how I met Haruka. She took me in.&quot;

Rei knew she was talking too much. Serena asked about her parents, not 
about her life as an assassin. She knew she&#39;d regret this the next day. 
She knew this might cause her downfall eventually. But she couldn&#39;t find 
it in herself to care. As much as that frightened her, she couldn&#39;t help 
but feel strangely comforted by it. Comforted by the fact that there was 
someone she could tell.

&quot;Word got out pretty quickly about me. I started getting jobs, and two 
years later, with Haruka and Makoto&#39;s help, I established a pretty good 
reputation. The smaller jobs stopped coming in. Every few months I&#39;d 
take something big and make enough money to last me a while. The jobs 
got bigger and bigger...&quot;

Rei trailed off, but Serena knew exactly what was coming next. Her 
current job, kidnapping her.

But the blonde felt neither anger nor any hatred. No, only sympathy and 
sorrow for the woman in her arms. No one deserved that, especially not a 
child.

She didn&#39;t wonder why Rei was who she was anymore. She didn&#39;t really 
have a choice. Human instincts told her to survive, no matter what the 
cost and outcome.

Serena felt something dampen her shirt. It took her a few moments to 
realize what that something was.

Rei&#39;s tears.

&quot;Don&#39;t cry,&quot; Serena said softly.

Instinct made her draw Rei even closer to her body. Hesitantly, she ran 
her fingers through the assassin&#39;s soft hair.

Despite the situation, contentment raced through the blonde. She wasn&#39;t 
going to deny she&#39;s thought about holding Rei nor about running her hand 
through her hair. She knew it was wrong since she was engaged to Mamoru.

But it didn&#39;t matter.

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Rei, let it out.&quot;

Serena sat quietly with the trembling woman in her arms. Raven and 
blonde hair intertwined as Serena tucked Rei&#39;s head under her chin.

Minutes later, the blonde could tell Rei had stopped crying. Hesitantly, 
she pulled away.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot;

Rei nodded, keeping her head down. Serena reached over and placed her 
hand under the assassin&#39;s chin. Slowly, she lifted the raven-topped 
head.

Traces of dry tears marred the woman&#39;s smooth skin. Lavender met blue 
for a split second. There, in her eyes, was a heart-breaking, yet at the 
same time, captivating vulnerability. The tough exterior had been shed 
and the threatening glares no where to be seen. Even the condescending 
smirk was gone. Here she was, the real Rei Hino under it all... a lost 
and hurting woman who never quite got over old pains.

The sight made Serena both sick with sorrow and excited at the trust 
displayed in Rei&#39;s voluntary unmasking. Without another word, Serena 
pulled her into another tight hug.

&#39;I&#39;ll never let you be hurt again...&#39;

But Serena knew she would never be able to fulfill that promise.

&#39;Even so, I&#39;ll try my hardest to keep you from getting hurt again... I 
swear...&#39;

The protective feeling Serena got from holding Rei was completely 
foreign to her. Usually other people protected her, kept her sheltered 
and safe. But this feeling of protectiveness, this power it inspired in 
her was... fulfilling. It gave her a sense of purpose.

&quot;Thank you.&quot;

The soft whisper sent the blonde&#39;s heart into overdrive. Even when 
vulnerable, the woman in her arms was alluring and mesmerizing. Which 
was a thought she couldn&#39;t really afford to have

&quot;For what?&quot;

Rei buried her face in Serena&#39;s shirt.

&quot;Listening.&quot;

The older woman looked down at the woman she held. It felt so different, 
but good to be the strong one. It made her feel... needed.

&quot;Anytime.&quot;

Their eyes met as Rei looked up. Suddenly the assassin moved forward. 
She didn&#39;t know what it was exactly that possessed her to do it. Maybe 
it was the way Serena looked in the candlelight, so soft and young, but 
strong. Perhaps it was the stars twinkling in the black velvet sky that 
seemed to surround them. Or maybe it was this whole role reversal thing. 
But whatever it was, Rei felt drawn to Serena like never before.

The blonde froze when she saw the other woman leaning toward her. Acting 
on its own accord, her own head moved downward. She licked her lips 
quickly, anticipating the feel of those full, ruby lips on hers.

Their lips brushed tentatively before they pulled away. Rei shivered, 
the contact more intense than anything she&#39;s ever felt. Especially from 
such a brief touch. She&#39;s been with so many people, and none came close 
to what Serena made her feel in that simple caress of their lips. She 
craved for more, truly, madly and deeply.

Serena felt her whole body shut down. The only sensation she felt came 
from her lips. And they seemed to burn. Such a sweet touch. Not even a 
kiss with Mamoru could measure up. It was... amazing. Instinctively, 
Serena tightened her arms around Rei&#39;s body and leaned down for another.

Rei&#39;s heart began to beat wildly. This feeling was foreign, but 
frighteningly intoxicating. She knew it wasn&#39;t right to kiss Serena. But 
she&#39;s never wanted anything so bad.

Serena was sweet, innocently, kind and simply bubbling with happiness. 
Rei&#39;s never met anyone like her before. The people she knew were rough, 
hard and cruel. People that wouldn&#39;t think twice about turning on her 
for the right price. The blonde was far from all those things. She 
didn&#39;t have a single bad bone in her body.

And now Rei was about to kiss her again. The thought sent a shiver of 
excitement through her body.

Rei licked her lips. A taste of heaven... for the woman who&#39;d sold her 
soul.

Serena moaned softly as their lips touched for the second time. The 
woman was an amazing kisser, and her lips were like sin.

The blonde had always been told to be a good girl. Listen to your 
elders, get good grades, behave like a proper lady, never cause trouble, 
never do anything you&#39;re not supposed to do...

And this was definitely something she was not supposed to do. In fact, 
it&#39;s so wrong... it&#39;s right.

Serena finally knew why people say once you get a taste of the 
forbidden, you can never go back.

She knew she couldn&#39;t go back. Rei&#39;s kisses were the guilty pleasure, 
the fluttering in her stomach the wrong thing to feel. And the lust she 
felt for more for her dirty desire...for more of Rei.

She&#39;d found her forbidden fruit.

Sweet like candy, soft like rose petals and pure, in the simplest sense.

Serena smiled against Rei&#39;s lips as she felt the raven-haired woman&#39;s 
arms snake around her neck. She could definitely get used to kissing 
Rei. Mamoru? Great kisser, but nothing compared to this. Blue eyes 
opened as she felt the woman pull away. She opened her mouth to protest, 
a childish pout forming.

Lavender eyes twinkled wit amusement as Rei pressed a finger to Serena&#39;s 
lips. The mere sight of her pout almost sent Rei&#39;s self-control out the 
window. Who cared about the consequences when the crime was so... 
perfect. She wouldn&#39;t mind being sent to hell for committing such an 
enticing-

Speaking of enticing ...

Serena gazed at her with her baby blues, which were adorably wide with 
confusion and frustration. A smirk played on Rei&#39;s lips at the sight of 
lust clouding those beautiful eyes. Why did she pull away again?

Anything remotely considered rational left her the second Serena pressed 
their lips together again. The blonde pulled away when Rei let out a 
soft moan.

Serena laughed at the annoyed expression on her companion&#39;s face.

&quot;You looked like you were about to kiss me... but didn&#39;t. So... I 
figured I should, hmm, exact my revenge.&quot;

Rei snorted. Revenge? That was fresh. Maybe she should-

&quot;Why did you pull away?&quot;

The assassin&#39;s face fell, her eyes lowering. Dread filled Serena. This 
couldn&#39;t be good.

&quot;It&#39;s noth-&quot;

Rei snapped her mouth shut. It wasn&#39;t nothing. It was something, 
something important. Sure, she&#39;d hate herself after she says it. Oh 
Hell, she hated herself now. But she had to be fair, not only to 
Serena... but to herself.

&quot;Serena, you should think about this.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I mean, you&#39;re in a serious relationship with Chiba... you&#39;re away from 
your family and friends. I&#39;m the only one you see every day... I think 
you&#39;re just stressed or-&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re right.&quot;

Rei squeezed her eyes shut. Of course, good-bye piece of Heaven. Why did 
she have to say something?&quot;

&quot;But... tonight&#39;s perfect, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

Lavender eyes snapped open as she gawked at the blonde. Serena smiled 
softly. She didn&#39;t know what was going on. She didn&#39;t know if it was the 
atmosphere or the situation or if she really felt something like that 
for Rei. But either way, she wanted this for as long as possible.

&quot;Yes... it is perfect.&quot;

Blue eyes closed slowly.

&quot;Then why ruin it?&quot;

&quot;Serena...&quot;

&quot;Rei,&quot; the blonde whispered softly, cutting off the other woman. She 
opened her eyes, the smile on her lips wistful. &quot;I&#39;ve been good all my 
life.&quot;

She placed a hand on Rei&#39;s cheek. &quot;I&#39;ve always done the right thing, 
been the good little girl. But just this once, I want to forget being 
rational. I want a taste of-&quot;

Serena was cut off when Rei kissed her firmly. She shifted against the 
couch. This was definitely not sweet and tender like before.

Rei&#39;s lips caressed hers with fervor, leaving Serena breathless. The 
blonde responded to her passion by wrapping her arms around the strong 
body pressed against her as tightly as she could. Oh god, has she ever 
kissed before this?

The assassin nibbled on Serena&#39;s lip, drawing a gasp, to her pleasure. 
To Hell with consequences. Who cared about rationality? Could proper 
behavior compare to this?

&#39;Dream on, Hino.&#39;

Somewhere in Rei&#39;s lust-filled mind, she knew she was going too fast. 
Hell, she didn&#39;t even know Serena had any desire to kiss her ten minutes 
ago. She had been in the middle of a breakdown. Did she even know she 
wanted the blonde?

Who knew? Emotions were not her strong point. The only two feelings she 
was accustomed to were indifference and anger. And brief bouts of lust.

But lust a physical reaction, and not an emotional one, right? Rei was 
feeling pretty lustful right now. The thought not to hurt Serena did 
occur, but like she said, to Hell with rationality. All she saw was 
Serena, all she could think about was Serena.

Rei pulled away and watched as the blonde tilted her head back, chest 
rising and falling rapidly as she gasped for breath. The assassin licked 
her lips, never one to give up a prime opportunity.

Ruby lips kissed the pale and soft skin at Serena&#39;s throat. The blonde&#39;s 
eyes widened, barely suppressing a moan. Rei&#39;s eyes twinkled. So that&#39;s 
the way she wanted it. As she returned to showering her lips with 
kisses, she briefly compared the girl in her arms to her cousin.

Minako, now there was a woman who knew exactly what to do. In fact, she 
was definitely one of the best lovers Rei has ever had, if not the best. 
Sure, to most people they looked like the most they&#39;ve done was flirt.

How wrong they were.

Rei knew Minako two months before the idol introduced her to Serena. The 
assassin thought it would be a total drag to have to flirt with an 
arrogant star like Minako. The image she had of the blonde was that of a 
completely egotistical bitch, without the beauty she appeared to have. 
She thought the wonderful starlet was only an illusion made by tricks 
and mirrors.

Bu the first month turned out to be an intense game of cat and mouse. 
Instead of being on the offensive like she thought she would be, Rei 
became the prey. The first meeting was innocent enough. Rei was the 
waitress for Minako and a few of her friends.

The blonde gave her the look over and asked when her shift was over. For 
once, Rei was taken aback by someone. Minako radiated confidence. She 
knew how to carry herself, knew she was beautiful and knew she was 
charming. But most dangerous of all, she knew how to use her beauty and 
charm. If Rei was anyone else, she would have fallen head over heels in 
love with Minako.

But Rei was not just another woman.

Minako&#39;s physical attraction to her quickly turned into the basis of her 
plan to get Serena. For the next month, Rei would bait Minako with 
everything she had, only to snap it away when the blonde had a taste. 
Just as she hoped, Minako only pursued her harder.

Finally, Rei let herself be caught. A date at Minako&#39;s house.

Usually, she didn&#39;t count on being seduced in one night. Or ever, 
really. She&#39;s usually the one doing the seducing.

But the night at Minako&#39;s had been Heaven. First dinner, a quiet 
candle-lit affair at the star&#39;s penthouse. Then they did a little star 
gazing over dessert. After that? Well, only one of the most amazing 
nights of her life.

&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes focused on the blonde before. This wasn&#39;t Minako. It&#39;s 
Serena. The two have to be treated differently.

&quot;Nothing of importance,&quot; she said, feeling a strange little thud in her 
heart.

Serena wrinkled her nose and pulled Rei down. The assassin shivered, 
wondering if there was a gene in the family that both blondes got. 
Serena whispered in her ear, pink lips brushing against her ear 
deliberately as she spoke.

&quot;I may not have much experience, but I know you&#39;re not supposed to be 
thinking of someone else.&quot;

Rei stiffened visibly. Serena pulled away slightly, blue eyes searching 
her face. The assassin&#39;s face was blank, revealing nothing. Her eyes on 
the other hand betrayed her.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry-&quot;

&quot;I was just teasing.&quot;

Rei pulled away guiltily. With other people it felt fine to compare and 
contrast, but it didn&#39;t with Serena. The blonde was too good to treat 
like that.

&quot;Rei?&quot;

Serena wrapped her arms around the assassin&#39;s waist to keep her still. 
Stupid her, she just had to say something. Now Rei wasn&#39;t even looking 
at her.

To be honest, she was... scared. Rei&#39;s obviously had more experience. 
Her? Almost nothing. What if she can&#39;t measure up to what Rei&#39;s had 
before?

&quot;This isn&#39;t right.&quot;

Serena opened her mouth to speak when Rei turned away from her.

&quot;It&#39;s the situation. You&#39;ve been through a lot lately.&quot;

The blonde lowered her head quietly.

&quot;I&#39;m going to get some air.&quot;

Rei stood, almost racing for the door. Serena laid down, pulling the 
blankets over her.

The assassin stood on the balcony. She looked up at the millions of 
stars overhead. That had been so hard. So hard to resist Serena, to walk 
away. She knew she had done the right thing.

So why did she feel like shit?</pre>
