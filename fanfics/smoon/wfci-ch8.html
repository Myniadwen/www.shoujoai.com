<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wfci-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Pain. Unbelievably blinding pain. Was Usagi screaming? She was&#133;but it 
was hard to focus. Why is she screaming? It hurts...the girls are running 
to me...are they...so hard....I feel so tired...I can hear Minako, taking 
charge...wow... Poor Mitsuki is shaking like a leaf. &#147;Mitsuki! Get under 
control!&#148; I hear her scream. She&#146;s never screamed at Mitsuki...she must be 
worried....I can feel Usagi cradling my head, and Makoto...what is she 
doing? It&#146;s fuzzy...I. hear her say, &#147;Ami, find the wound!&#148; And then Ami 
is there. &#147;You HAVE to stay awake Rei,&#148; she pleads. &#147;Come on Dragon, 
talk to us...&#148; that&#146;s Mitsuki. &#147;Yeah, Rei! You gotta stay up!&#148; Makoto 
now...my head hurts from all the yelling...&#148;Koi? Rei-chan...stay up for 
us...me...it&#146;s Usagi...come on koi, stay up...&#148; I smile. She called me her 
love....that keeps my eyes open. &#147;Yeah...Usagi-chan...I&#146;ll try...&#148; I 
whisper...I sound so weak, even to my own ears....I&#146;m so tired...but I won&#146;t 
sleep...I&#146;ll stay awake...

For her...

====================

Hotaru choked back a sob. &#147;Setsuna-mama....is she dead?&#148; The woman turned 
to the girl and shook her head. &#147;No....but she doesn&#146;t have much 
time...Haruka, Michiru...go get Rei to a hospital now...and I will take care 
of Endymion.&#148; Haruka nodded, and Michiru blinked. &#147;But....how will we get 
her there in time?&#148; Setsuna smiled wryly, and threw a set of keys to 
Haruka. &#147;The young lady, Ami...the blue-haired one. She was a student at 
one of the finest medical schools on the Earth&#146;s Moon...just 16 too, and 
already in college. She will sustain Rei until you get her there...and 
Michiru?&#148;

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;Heh....don&#146;t get sticky fingers and take my car. I just got it insured...&#148;

====================

Drake had never cared much for thieves. He had been pick pocketed once 
as a boy, and since then, he had never trusted them. 

Over time, he never really trusted the poor at all. His father had been 
poor, and he never did get along with the man. He thought the poor were 
simply obstacles to step over, as time went on.

But seeing his daughter so distraught when Endymion shot that girl did 
something to him. Deep down, in his heart, he knew that the girl had 
done nothing at all to hurt his daughter.

And if his daughter could care for these people, then why couldn&#146;t he?

&#147;She isn&#146;t dead?!&#148; He caught Endymion out the corner of his eye. &#147;Stop 
boy! Are you crazy?!&#148; Endymion glared at the older man. &#147;Hmph....she&#146;s 
just riffraff.&#148; Drake frowned. &#147;Stop that RIGHT now, boy! Are you mad?! 
You could hit Serenity!&#148; Endymion frowned, his blue eyes hardening. &#147;Did 
you see what she just did with that...&#148; he shuddered, &#147;that girl? She&#146;s 
sick, obviously. That girl has tainted her mi&#151;&#148; He cried out as Drake 
twisted his wrist, and wrenched the gun from his hands. Endymion was 
about to charge at the older man, but Drake pointed the gun at him.

&#147;Don&#146;t make me use this, boy...&#148;

===================

&#147;We have to get her to the hospital...she&#146;s losing consciousness... &#147; Ami&#146;s 
expression was grave. She had tried her hardest to stop the flow of 
blood, but if they did not get Rei in a hospital soon...it would be to 
late. Makoto shook her head, and looked up. &#147;Hey! Is that...that cop and 
her girlfriend?&#148; The car screeched around the corner, and came to an 
abrupt halt. Setsuna and Hotaru climbed out, as well as Haruka and 
Michiru. Minako gawked at them. &#147;Where were you all?&#148; Setsuna sighed. 
&#147;Not far off...we heard the shot, but my eyes were not sharp enough to 
make out who it was...until Hotaru alerted me. Haruka and Michiru will 
take you to a hospital. Now hurry.&#148; Ami looked up at Setsuna. &#147;Where 
will you be?&#148; Setsuna frowned. &#147;No time. Hurry.&#148; They all nodded, and 
hurriedly went to the car....

===================

Setsuna was a bit surprised when she saw that Serenity&#146;s father 
obviously had everything under control. &#147;Ahem...sir....what are we to do 
with him?&#148; Drake smiled grimly. &#147;I have no idea, Miss Setsuna.&#148; Hotaru 
grinned. &#147;I say we kill him!&#148; Setsuna shook her head. 

&#147;I do wonder how you became so violent...&#148;

===================

I&#146;m so tired...I can barely feel anything...voice sound so far away now...I&#146;m 
being lifted up...where am I going? I hear someone say, &#147;It&#146;ll be 
alright,&#148; and I smile and close my eyes...it&#146;s like floating...

===================

They waited. Michiru yawned, and leaned on Haruka&#146;s shoulder, Ami wrung 
her hands, Minako nuzzled against Mitsuki&#146;s shoulder, and Makoto paced 
back and forth. Serenity&#146;s eyes were closed.

She would pray.

Not much was said, as they all sat in that waiting room, waiting for the 
news, be it good or bad. One could guess they were in their own 
worlds...trying to keep their minds on something else. 

They all looked up when they heard the doctor walk in.

He sighed, and smiled softly.

&#147;She&#146;s fine. We&#146;ve stabilized her...&#148;

===================

Setsuna smiled as the police car drove off with Endymion in it. Drake 
smiled, and clapped the bounty hunter rather hard on the back. &#147;We did 
it, dear! Endymion is gone, and my daughter is...where is my daughter?&#148; 
Setsuna caught her balance, and sighed. &#147;She&#146;s at the hospital sir. We 
should be going.&#148; Drake smiled. &#147;Yes, of course!&#148;

Epilogue

Three months later...

&#147;Ack!&#148;

&#147;Sit still, Minako! You idiot!&#148;

&#147;Where&#146;s my koi? Mitssssuuuukkki-chan! Rei&#146;s being mean again!&#148;

&#147;Aya..just sit still for the picture Minako...&#148;

&#147;All of you girls, sit still now!&#148;

&#147;Yes sir...&#148;

Rei rolled her eyes, and tugged at the red dress she was wearing. She 
gazed over to Serenity, who smiled and winked at her. &#145;you look cute,&#146; 
she mouthed to the red head, and Rei rubbed the back of her head. 
&#147;Thanks,&#148; she whispered, &#147;so do you.&#148; A faint blush washed across 
Serenity&#146;s cheeks before she turned back to her father. &#147;Daddy, I think 
we&#146;re all settled now.&#148; Drake grinned and looked around. &#147;Now Setsuna, 
Hotaru lean in closer...that&#146;s it...stand up straighter Makoto...all right...now 
smile everyone!&#148;

The picture flashed right after Minako grabbed onto Mitsuki&#146;s thigh, 
causing her to yelp and fall on Ami, who in turn, pulled Makoto down, 
who stumbled over Setsuna, who tripped onto Hotaru, who pulled Haruka &amp; 
Michiru down with her, who grabbed Rei and Serenity, which made them 
fall.

They all glared at Minako, and Minako pouted and stared at Mitsuki.

&#147;Koi....&#148;

Mitsuki rolled her eyes and sighed.

&#147;Yes?&#148;

&#147;I love you.&#148;

&#147;I know...Minako, I know. I love you too.&#148;

Rei laughed a little bit. &#147;I still think you&#146;re soft Mitsuki.&#148; Usagi 
giggled, and Mitsuki frowned. &#147;It&#146;s not like you can stay mad at Usagi, 
either.&#148; Rei smiled softly. &#147;Welll...&#148; Serenity leaned over and kissed her 
on the cheek. &#147;Don&#146;t even try to lie about it.&#148;

Drake laughed. &#147;Ah, to be young and in love. Now everyone, get situated. 
And Minako dear...try to keep your hands to yourself.&#148; He winked.

The others laughed, and Minako groaned.

&#147;Yes sir...&#148;

Awww...wasn&#146;t that kawaii...finally done...gah...hope you enjoyed it. I 
actually wanted this to just be a chapter, and then the Epilogue in 
another chapter, but I changed my mind.

I hate ending stories on odd numbers, anyway. ^^;;

Welll...my first Rei/Usagi fic completed. As always, it didn&#146;t turn out 
the way I expected it to be, but hey...that&#146;s the way the cookie crumbles.

Thank you, ALL of my reviewers, and even my shady closet readers who are 
too lazy to review...lol. I appreciate the support. 

See you next fic! Peace and love.
