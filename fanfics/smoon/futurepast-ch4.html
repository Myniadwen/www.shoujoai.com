<h1>A Future Shaped by the Past (part 4 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/futurepast-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>Mists of Eternity

The mists of eternity swirled and parted at the figure&#39;s feet, eager to 
escape the tumultuous emotions of the Guardian of Time. Confident that 
her reborn and now awakened ally, Michiru, was secure in her apartment 
and sleeping off the events of several exhausting days after remembering 
her past life and being awakened as Sailor Neptune, Pluto had finally 
returned to her post, hoping that Michiru could handle the memories and 
emotions that threatened to overwhelm her.

The sapphire haired woman sighed as she collapsed into a large chair 
hidden by the mists. Sometimes, she wondered what was worse, the 
statically boring centuries she had endured prior to the rebirth of her 
friends, encompassing the hundreds of years where thoughts of Haruka and 
Michiru had been relegated to the backburners of her mind, or now, the 
present, where she had been presented with the effort of trying to bring 
together the partnership of one of the strongest unions in the solar 
system.

The conviction in Neptune, or rather, Michiru&#39;s voice when the aqua 
haired girl had accepted her destiny still sent shivers down Pluto&#39;s 
spine. The fire that burned in her icy eyes, every pulse and synapse 
that ran through the young woman&#39;s body created almost a mirror image to 
the Michiru of the Silver Millennium; completely dedicated to her love 
of Haruka. She had not strayed from destiny&#39;s path.

Where Haruka had.

Haruka was not the mirror image of herself from a millennia ago. The 
darkened, cynical, lonely woman who shunned those around her was not who 
Haruka was supposed to be. Rather, she was the mirror image of the shell 
that held Uranus&#39; likeness after the fall of Moon Kingdom. That, after 
that terrible day, Haruka fell victim to her duty and her personality 
having changed so drastically, her destiny was thrown to the element 
that should have saved her, not destroyed her. Was there any hope at all 
for the wayward Haruka?

&quot;Uranus told me that she wasn&#39;t ready to be awakened yet. But she also 
asked me not to give up hope.&quot;

Michiru&#39;s words lit a spark of hope that warmed Pluto. For the spirit of 
Uranus to have contacted Neptune was more than she could ever have 
hoped. The long suppressed emotions that the stoic warrior had discarded 
so long ago had reached out. The rebirth of Michiru&#39;s memories of her 
past life had triggered Uranus to break one of the many barriers that 
imprisoned Haruka&#39;s true personality. Perhaps there was hope yet.

Pluto shook her head. It would do her no good to get her hopes up yet. 
If Uranus would soon be receptive to being awakened, it would then be 
the time to bring the two together and hope that Michiru&#39;s dedication to 
her past lover would be enough to bring the rogue Haruka back to the 
woman she once was. And if such an effort could be accomplished, perhaps 
Pluto herself could return to the woman she once was, too.

&quot;Setsuna! You were called Setsuna!&quot;

Michiru&#39;s voice still fresh in her ears, a smile captured Pluto&#39;s lips 
as for the first time in centuries, she allowed herself the indulgence 
to think of her friends during the Silver Millennium.

flashback

Sailor Senshi Pluto smoothed out her green skirt contemplatively before 
pushing her way into Queen Serenity&#39;s chambers. She hadn&#39;t visited the 
Moon Palace since she had first given her allies, Uranus and Neptune, 
their missions more than one year prior. She wondered what could 
possibly be important enough for her Queen to pull her away from her 
post at the Time Gate. Surely, the foreseer of the future hadn&#39;t sensed 
anything that needed tending to on the Moon.

Pluto approached the throne and dropped to one knee. &quot;You summoned me, 
my Queen?&quot;

Surprisingly, Queen Serenity sighed and smacked her lips in an irritated 
fashion. &quot;Honestly, Pluto. You&#39;ve been in my service for two millennia 
and you&#39;ve been my closest advisor for just as long. How long will you 
insist on such formalities?&quot;

Pluto&#39;s brow furrowed in confusion. &quot;As long as your actions earn my 
respect, my Queen, as they always have.&quot;

Serenity rose from her marble throne and lowered herself to meet Pluto&#39;s 
garnet eyes. Kneeling on the hard, marbled floors for one of her 
subjects was not beneath the monarch of the Silver Millennium. &quot;Pluto, 
I&#39;d like to think that I&#39;m more than just your Queen. I&#39;d like to think 
that I&#39;m you friend, also. Do you see me as such?&quot; She asked softly.

The Guardian of the Time Gate stared at her leader blankly. In her long 
life of little contact, Pluto had never used that word. &quot;Friends?&quot; She 
asked cautiously, wondering if the wealth of emotions she felt, yet had 
never before displayed for her Queen might mean this foreign word.

&quot;Yes. Friends.&quot; Queen Serenity smiled softly and took Pluto&#39;s hands in 
her own, helping her to rise off her knees as they both stood. &quot;And I 
think you need more of them.&quot;

&quot;I beg your pardon, my Queen?&quot; Pluto began, and then was chilled by an 
icy glare from her leader. &quot;I mean, Serenity-san.&quot; She amended, trying 
her hand at being marginally less formal.

&quot;That&#39;s your problem, Pluto. You&#39;re always so formal. Being trapped at 
the Time Gate, your social skills are more than lacking.&quot; She chuckled 
quietly at her advisor&#39;s incredulous expression. Serenity was surely 
known for her honesty and lack of subtlety. &quot;If such a time should come, 
how do you expect your allies to fight next to you if you barely even 
know them?&quot;

&quot;Uranus and Neptune?&quot; Pluto asked hesitantly, naming those allies that 
she would fight alongside should the need arise.

&quot;Haruka and Michiru.&quot; Queen Serenity corrected sweetly, trying to get 
the duty hardened Pluto to think of her allies as not only senshi, but 
mere humans, too. &quot;Spend time with them. Learn to understand them and to 
understand what it means to truly be human. Get to know yourself, 
Pluto.&quot;

Pluto&#39;s head cocked to the side in thought. Serenity&#39;s offer was 
appealing, if not a little frightening, and although time on the mortal 
plane sounded like a worthwhile experience, she had her duty to think of 
as well. &quot;And what of the Time Gate?&quot;

The Queen of the Moon sighed. Her advisor had spent most of her long 
life at her post, dedicated to her duty and nothing else. The woman 
deserved much more than just the short reprieve she planned to grant 
her. &quot;Leave it. We&#39;ve been at peace for almost a millennia. Besides, you 
have not alerted me to any problems on the horizon.&quot;

&quot;This is true.&quot; Pluto confirmed hesitantly. &quot;Although, as you know, 
there is an unease about the solar system, though there has been nothing 
I can detect from my post. But,&quot;

&quot;But nothing.&quot; Queen Serenity said authoritatively. &quot;Pluto, you need 
time for yourself, and you could use other friends too. I order you to 
take leave from the Time Gate until it is necessary for you to return.&quot;

Pluto hid her garnet eyes behind thick, green bangs. &quot;Understood, 
Serenity-san.&quot;

Older, wiser and with even more sex appeal, Michiru at seventeen years 
of age fully understood the pull her body held over Haruka, and she was 
not beneath using it to her advantage.

At the moment, the senshi of Neptune was craving quiet solace that only 
her stoic partner could provide, and even though the continued pain that 
came with not understanding Haruka&#39;s feelings for her constantly ate at 
her, she longed for the stronger woman&#39;s arms none the less. Little had 
changed in their relationship, their flirting had grown more dangerous 
and suggestive as ever, their chemistry had become a tangible force and 
those that didn&#39;t know them, and even some who did, thought the 
beautiful pair to be lovers.

Yet still, Haruka and Michiru hadn&#39;t bridged that unspoken gap between 
them, their reluctance to speak about the closeness of their was 
relationship had become so great that Michiru feared that if she were to 
put words to their actions and emotions, the binds that kept them close 
could break apart.

In the fading light of dusk, almost tentatively, Michiru raised her fist 
to knock on Haruka&#39;s door, just one down from her own similar suite. The 
sound of her knock echoed too loudly through the corridors of the palace 
hallway for her liking, and immediately upon hearing her partner&#39;s 
voice, the senshi of the ocean slipped in through the door.

Sprawled across her bed with a book in hand, her back against the 
headboard, a lightly clothed Haruka caught Michiru&#39;s eyes with a hint of 
mischief in her hazel depths. &quot;What? Training wasn&#39;t strenuous enough? 
You need me to tire you out some more?&quot;

The blonde&#39;s hearty laugh grated at Michiru and the smaller woman found 
she had to force herself not to answer in honesty to Haruka&#39;s 
flirtatious flippancy. Not trusting her mouth, she kept it shut and 
crossed the distance from the door to Haruka&#39;s bed. Wordlessly, she 
crawled onto the bed, kneeling in front of her partner.

Haruka&#39;s novel fell from her fingertips numbly. As she lost herself in 
the senshi of the ocean&#39;s gaze, the taller woman tensed at the 
unexpectedness of her partner&#39;s actions. &quot;Michiru, are you alright?&quot; She 
asked softly. &quot;Are you ill? Injured?&quot;

Too frozen to move a single muscle, Haruka gazed at the aqua haired 
woman&#39;s small form, diminished further by her sudden vulnerability. 
Could she be homesick? What could bother the strong Michiru to the point 
of wordlessness?

&quot;Shhh.&quot; Michiru replied softly, unable to form words. Though she wanted 
much, much more, for the moment, she&#39;d force herself to be content with 
Haruka&#39;s closeness.

The senshi of the wind swallowed audibly as the smaller woman turned to 
display her back to her, her too-thin nightgown showing off her 
exquisite feminine form as she curled into a ball next to her, resting 
her head on her partner&#39;s lap. Haruka&#39;s fingers ached to sink into 
Michiru&#39;s aqua hair, to caress the smooth skin of her neck, to...

Haruka tried desperately to derail her dangerous thoughts, but her 
fingers found themselves entwined in Michiru&#39;s locks before she had even 
realized it. A sigh escaped her lips as she realized that it was as soft 
as she had imagined. As her long fingers brushed against the smooth skin 
of Michiru&#39;s neck, she promised herself not to take advantage of her 
situation, no matter how right such action may seem.

After all, Haruka was sure that Michiru&#39;s actions were no different than 
those of the silly inner senshi girls. She had noticed that many of the 
younger girl&#39;s friendships allowed for such soft touches, hugs, and 
butterfly kisses. Friendship. Surely, that was what Michiru was looking 
for.

The senshi of the wind felt guilty that her own emotions were not so 
pure. What she wanted was more than just a friendship with the aqua 
haired goddess currently in her lap. Much more. But she refused to push 
her desires on her partner.

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was a mere whisper as the slight girl sat up 
to face her partner, only inches away from the blonde&#39;s face.

The senshi of the wind froze, remembering her partner&#39;s sixth sense of 
intuitiveness. Had she been found out? Her heart skipped a beat in her 
chest. She was entranced as each second seemed to last an eternity. They 
were painfully slowly leaning closer to each other. Michiru&#39;s lips 
parted, her warm breath on Haruka&#39;s own trembling lips, but was it all 
her imagination?

A loud, firm knock on the door and the sound of it swinging open on its 
hinges caused the girls to gasp as their eyes shot to the door in frozen 
surprise, Haruka tightening her hold on Michiru&#39;s waist protectively at 
the unknown threat.

Sailor Pluto stood in the entrance with a blank expression on her face, 
for the first time in her life at a total loss for words in the awkward 
situation she&#39;d found herself in. She eyed the two on the bed, trying to 
determine their relationship. They were close, very close, but her own 
intuitiveness told her that they hadn&#39;t admitted that their feelings for 
each other were the same.

&quot;If... if I&#39;ve caught you two at a bad time, I can come... err... back?&quot; 
She stuttered uncomfortably.

Michiru&#39;s signature giggle filled the room and broke the ice, the blush 
fading from her cheeks at the hilarity of it all. Brushing off the close 
encounter with her partner, she immediately attended to her floundering 
ally, expertly hiding her desperate sense of loss once squirming from 
Haruka&#39;s hold.

&quot;Are you going to come in or just stand there with your jaw hanging 
open?&quot; Haruka asked brashly, following Michiru&#39;s lead though a fraction 
of her bravado was diminished by the lingering blush that tinged her 
cheeks, her mind indulging in what might have transpired between herself 
and Michiru had their untimely ally not barged in.

Pluto did as was suggested. Latching the door behind her, she stepped 
into the entryway uncomfortably. Michiru regretfully slid from Haruka&#39;s 
large bed as she stood to greet her fellow senshi, wanting to ease 
Pluto&#39;s sense of intrusion and outsider-ness. &quot;It&#39;s good to see you 
again, Pluto. It&#39;s been a year and a half since you gave us our mission. 
Has something happened regarding its importance?&quot;

&quot;Not exactly.&quot; Pluto replied, quickly recovering from the awkward 
situation she had caused. &quot;Perhaps a change in my own, personal 
mission.&quot;

&quot;Shall we discuss it over a cup of tea?&quot; Michiru asked softly, trying to 
make Pluto more comfortable as Haruka got the hint and rose to 
straighten up her seating area.

Pluto nodded. &quot;That sounds wonderful. Only...&quot;

&quot;Only what?&quot; Haruka asked, a slight laugh in her voice.

&quot;Only I feel quite overdressed.&quot; Pluto replied, eyebrows raised and a 
hint of an amused smile on her lips as she indicated her senshi fuku in 
relation to their scant nightclothes.

Haruka and Michiru blushed hotly, remembering their modesty.

Michiru sported one of Haruka&#39;s long sleeved shirts, the sleeves falling 
over her hands as she served her allies&#39; tea before taking a seat in a 
cushy chair next to her partner. &quot;So, Pluto, tell us this news which 
would take you from the Time Gate.&quot;

Pluto sipped her tea thoughtfully, her garnet eyes lost to recent memory 
as she shifted uncomfortably in her long unused civilian clothes she had 
reverted to in an effort to fit in. &quot;The Queen suggested I spend some 
time away from my post. She wants me to befriend the two of you so that 
we might become a more effective team.&quot;

&quot;She wants you to become more human.&quot; Haruka said plainly, reading 
between the lines of the plans of their compassionate Queen. She caught 
a dirty look from her partner indicating her lack of tact. &quot;What?&quot; She 
asked. It was certainly no secret to anyone in Queen Serenity&#39;s service 
that the cold and formal Sailor Pluto could use some help in the 
friendliness department.

&quot;Haruka is correct.&quot; Pluto said fairly, assuring Michiru that she wasn&#39;t 
offended by the lack of subtlety offered. &quot;And honestly, I think she&#39;s 
right. My inter-personal skills could use some brushing up on anyway.&quot;

&quot;So could your fashion sense.&quot; Haruka said lightly, a finger pointed to 
Pluto&#39;s sorely outdated clothing. &quot;How many millennia has it been since 
you&#39;ve worn civilian duds?&quot;

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Michiru exclaimed, but was eased by Pluto&#39;s quiet laugh.

&quot;I suppose you&#39;re right. I have a lot to learn.&quot; The sapphire haired 
woman admitted coyly. &quot;Queen Serenity has given me a room close to 
yours. I only hope you two don&#39;t keep me up all night.&quot; She smiled 
righteously at the blushes she caused on the faces of her allies. So 
far, she found that life on the mortal plane was rather enjoyable.

&quot;So, Pluto,&quot; Haruka said, making an effort to shift the focus of 
conversation off of her undefined relationship with Michiru, &quot;what 
should we call you?&quot;

&quot;Call me?&quot; The garnet eyed woman asked, her teacup paused enroute to her 
mouth.

Michiru nodded, following her partner&#39;s lead. &quot;A civilian name!&quot; She 
said excitedly. &quot;Something other than what your duty has named you.&quot;

Pluto sat her cup down thoughtfully. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve... I&#39;ve never 
had one before.&quot;

Michiru cocked her head to the side in thought, concentration etched 
into her beautiful features. &quot;Yuriko?&quot;

&quot;No, too girly.&quot; Haruka said, shaking her head.

&quot;Haruna?&quot; Michiru tried.

&quot;Too much like mine.&quot; Haruka complained.

&quot;Rin?&quot; Michiru asked.

&quot;Too bland.&quot; Haruka sighed.

&quot;Setsuna?&quot; Michiru proposed with more certainty.

&quot;Setsuna. I like that.&quot; Pluto said with conviction.

Haruka smiled widely. &quot;Well then, Setsuna, welcome home.&quot;

In almost two years since the induction of the outer senshi, there had 
been no indication that Sailor Saturn would be needed; yet, without 
warning, they found themselves on the purple planet.

Sailor Uranus&#39; hands balled into white-knuckled fists as she and her 
allies followed the chalky purple path on the barren surface of the 
inhospitable planet of Saturn. &quot;We shouldn&#39;t be here. There&#39;s no reason 
for this to be happening. If you can&#39;t sense a force dangerous enough to 
the Silver Millennium to cause her birth your premonitions must be 
wrong, Pluto.&quot; She barked into the harsh winds.

Neptune stopped and laid a hand on her partner&#39;s arm and shot Uranus a 
stern glare to rein her in. Sailor Pluto wordlessly continued ahead of 
them on the path, twisting her body precariously to walk through a 
crevice of a rocky cliff. The reflection of the far away sun glinted off 
her imposing Time Staff as her tall profile vanished completely.

&quot;Whether a danger to the solar system has come or not, Saturn has been 
born and we must deal with those implications.&quot; Neptune explained 
firmly.

Uranus shook her partner&#39;s hand off her irritably and crossed her arms 
over her chest, communicating her unhappiness with the situation. 
Neptune sighed at Uranus&#39; childish reaction, knowing the taller woman 
was apt to push anyone close to her away when her own fate hung in the 
balance. The situation wasn&#39;t any easier on Neptune, of course. With 
Saturn&#39;s birth came the threat of an unforeseeable catastrophe, a 
disaster hidden not only from herself, but from Pluto as well. Yet, in 
the face of such uncertainty, what choice did they have but to join 
forces with the senshi of destruction?

The breath of Neptune and Uranus caught in their throats as Pluto 
finally emerged from the cavernous hole ahead of them. A toddler, barely 
of walking age was wrapped in Pluto&#39;s gentle, yet tentative embrace. 
Even from so far away, the toddler&#39;s expressionless purple eyes locked 
onto the forms of Neptune and Uranus and seemed to bore through their 
very souls.

Uranus spat, the mucus from her mouth sinking onto the thick soil at her 
feet. &quot;She will be our destruction.&quot;

Neptune and Pluto looked away guiltily. Although neither one could see 
clearly the future that awaited them, neither could they deny Uranus&#39; 
premonition.

Haruka had quickly found that she couldn&#39;t begrudge Sailor Saturn for 
the destiny the young girl had been born into.

In the six months since the girl, who the three of them had named 
Hotaru, had come to live with the outer senshi, it hadn&#39;t taken the 
senshi of wind long to drop her reserves and embrace the child, and once 
she had, Haruka had reverted back to her normal, carefree personality 
and along with her other allies, had adopted the girl as her own.

Besides, when the small, raven haired girl had first entered their 
lives, the toddler hadn&#39;t even understood the nature of her terrible 
powers. Though she technically was the senshi of Saturn, her knowledge 
of her duty to sacrifice herself and the entire Silver Millennium for 
the good of the solar system had yet to be awakened. She had grown 
rapidly over the course of the six months she&#39;d been with the outer 
senshi, a sure sign of an approaching threat that still could not be 
determined. Regardless, Haruka had quickly found that she wanted to 
shield the young girl from the destiny that awaited her for as long as 
possible.

Michiru too, felt the same. Haruka knew that much, and the maternal 
instincts that Michiru displayed while caring for the young senshi had 
sent chills down Haruka&#39;s spine. The young addition to their team made 
Michiru happy. Setsuna also, and the three of them functioned as the 
young girl&#39;s parents, a missing link to their family that they had never 
known existed, and in turn, the child had brought the three adults even 
closer.

&quot;Haruka-papa?&quot; A young voice implored innocently.

The senshi of the wind looked down to her adopted daughter cheerfully, 
squeezing her hand gently. It had seemed almost over night that she had 
grown to the physical appearance of eight years of age. &quot;Yes, 
Hime-chan?&quot;

&quot;This shop is boring, and Michiru-mama and Setsuna-mama will likely shop 
forever. Let&#39;s go back to the main market place!&quot; The young girl said 
with exuberance. Her father figure was only too happy to oblige.

Michiru caught the two sneaking out of the shop from the corner of her 
eye. &quot;Hotaru-chan? You keep an eye out and don&#39;t let your Haruka-papa 
get into any trouble!&quot; She smiled as Haruka smacked her lips in mock 
annoyance as Hotaru pushed her from the store. A quick smirk on Haruka&#39;s 
lips told Michiru that she&#39;d pay for her comment later, and it was met 
by one of Michiru&#39;s own accepting the unspoken challenge.

As the Neptunian woman examined the clothing display, the store&#39;s 
merchant approached her with a lighthearted laugh as his eyes lingered 
on the retreating forms of father and child. &quot;What a beautiful child the 
two of you have!&quot; He said heartily, relishing in the aqua haired woman&#39;s 
blush and sudden far away look that captured her eyes. Upon seeing her 
sapphire haired companion, he clasped his hands together loudly and 
turned his attention on her. &quot;And you must be the lucky grandmother!&quot; He 
exclaimed brightly.

A sudden chill settled in the open air booth as Setsuna glared at the 
portly man. &quot;Grandmother?&quot; She grumbled. She glanced down at her 
clothing. She really had to learn to adopt the current millennium&#39;s 
fashion. Michiru laughed lightly and pushed the stunned woman from the 
booth and out of the awkward situation. &quot;It&#39;s the gray tunic? Isn&#39;t it? 
No one wears gray anymore.&quot; Setsuna grumbled.

Michiru chuckled at her fashion-limited friend. She still hadn&#39;t quite 
gotten the knack for dressing the part. Suddenly, the hairs on the back 
of her neck stood on end and she paused.

&quot;Michiru?&quot; Setsuna asked, bewildered at her friend&#39;s strange actions.

&quot;Haruka&#39;s up to no good.&quot; Michiru answered with a grin on her lips, her 
sixth sense on full alert.

Setsuna wordlessly followed her companion as she darted through an ally 
and down a street, somehow tracking the other two members of their 
impromptu family. &quot;Really, must we sneak around like this?&quot; The garnet 
eyed woman asked.

&quot;Ara? And you don&#39;t want to take part in catching Haruka red handed?&quot; 
Michiru asked lightly as she spotted their target.

Setsuna shut her mouth and leant against a merchant&#39;s booth as she kept 
her eyes trained on Haruka and Hotaru on the other side of the street.

&quot;Haruka-papa! Now!&quot; Hotaru urged, barely maintaining her excitement.

&quot;Not yet, Hime-chan, not yet.&quot; Haruka replied through clenched teeth, 
trying her best to look casual. She surveyed the street packed with 
women and men alike, browsing the wares in the marketplace. The scents 
of baked goods and cooked food wafted on the gentle breeze that played 
around them, waiting for the command to be issued as the senshi of the 
winds readied herself.

Suddenly, a ferocious gust of wind tore through the marketplace. Women&#39;s 
skirts flew up about their torsos, light wares were lifted off vendors&#39; 
tables, and paper products scattered to the merciless wind. A commotion 
of voices, a combination of laughter, surprised exclamations and 
scurrying was heard as the marketplace was quickly reassembled, and 
above it all, the mischievous laughter of Haruka and Hotaru could be 
heard.

&quot;Tenoh Haruka!&quot; The commanding voice of Michiru scolded as she and 
Setsuna caught up to their family.

Haruka slouched, knowing that trouble was coming and that she was too 
weak to run from she who would deliver it. Her hazel eyes, large and 
surprised caught her partner&#39;s. She knew her easy laugh and seductive 
smile wouldn&#39;t get her out of this one.

&quot;What have I told you about abusing your powers in public?&quot; Michiru 
scolded.

Haruka brightened. &quot;Ah, but I can do it in private?&quot; She asked 
suggestively, playing off of Michiru&#39;s words. She reveled at her 
partner&#39;s beautiful pouting expression, knowing she had won that spat, 
but little did she know that the worst was yet to come.

&quot;I knew that was you that blew my skirt over my head last week!&quot; Setsuna 
exclaimed angrily. &quot;And you told me that it was just the wind!&quot;

Michiru smacked her lips. &quot;Ara! After the third of fourth time that 
happened to me, I caught on to Haruka&#39;s game.&quot; She teased her friend, 
but then turned menacing eyes to Haruka. &quot;Have you been teaching 
Hotaru-chan how to abuse one&#39;s senshi powers?&quot;

&quot;Ah... no.&quot; Haruka tried, inching backwards. She&#39;d been caught. She 
heard the giggle of her daughter next to her. It was always funny when 
it wasn&#39;t happening to you. Michiru cocked an eyebrow. Haruka flinched. 
The next thing she knew, Haruka fell to her bottom and was drenched from 
head to toe. Her partner&#39;s skill with her element was such that she 
hadn&#39;t even seen the torrent of water coming at her.

A broad smile on her face, Michiru turned and walked away, Hotaru&#39;s 
skipping stride following after her mother. All that remained with the 
drenched Haruka was Setsuna&#39;s form, doubled over in righteous laughter.

&quot;You think that&#39;s so funny?&quot; Haruka asked, a glint in her eye barely 
detected through her limp, soaked bangs that hid it from view.

Setsuna detected the ripples of wind circling her friend and the 
laughter died in her throat, that deer in the headlights expression now 
gracing her own face. Her hands clamped down around her skirts. &quot;You 
wouldn&#39;t dare... Haruka... Haruka!&quot;

/flashback

A slight chuckle on her lips, the bittersweet memories lingered in her 
mind and Pluto came back to her senses with the realization of a hot 
sting behind her eyes of tears that would not fall.

She focused instead on her post. A glance to the Time Gate showed her 
those that had already awakened, the inner senshi. Indulging in rest and 
relaxation after the defeat of the Black Moon Kingdom, it was a break 
well deserved. The inners had done well defeating first Beryl and 
Metallia, and then the Black Moon Kingdom. Yet Pluto frowned. The next 
enemy on the horizon would be much stronger, she could feel it. The help 
of the outer senshi would be necessary in the coming battle. Their 
awakening was necessary.

Not that Pluto&#39;s powers to see the future were all-knowing. Quite the 
contrary, the mysteries of the future would only show themselves at 
their own discretion, and even then, that particular future could 
change. That was the nature of time. It could shift and destinies could 
change. Haruka&#39;s already had.

The Time Gate clouded and the images disappeared. No longer showing the 
five young girls, the doorway was now divided, displaying Haruka and 
Michiru, both asleep and dreaming. Pluto watched critically, knowing 
that Michiru was likely remembering the same memories that she had just 
indulged in. She hoped that Haruka, for once not being plagued by 
visions of the silence, was also being receptive to the memories that 
tried to break through the walls she had erected at the end of her past 
life, the walls that threatened to keep her separated from the one woman 
who could make her whole again.

The garnet eyed woman sighed with frustration. There was little more she

Hope that Michiru was strong enough to accept that reality, hope that 
Haruka would overcome her fears. But mostly, her hope was that Michiru 
and Haruka could figure out how to fix what had been broken so long ago.

Slowly, the aqua haired woman pulled away, her eyes opening slowly as 
she observed her partner&#39;s stiff posture. She couldn&#39;t tell if the 
moisture in Haruka&#39;s eyes were tears or an illusion created by the 
reflection of the pool by their feet. Her breath caught in her throat as 
she panicked. Had she read Haruka wrong? Had she misinterpreted the song
