<h1>Don't Look Back (part 12 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch11.html">Back to Part 11</a><pre>Haruka sat in the waiting room of the local hospital, staring blankly 
at the sign above the door of the operating room they had her love in. 
And she did love Michiru. She&#146;d realized it last night as she held the 
woman in her arms, trying in vain to stop the bleeding from the center 
of her chest, below the ribs. She&#146;d been unable to go in the ambulance 
with Michiru as Lil refused to let go of Mike&#146;s drugged body. The 
other blonde had been needled during the struggle, solving the mystery 
of how Derek had downed her. So after following them to the hospital, 
she&#146;d been forced to sit in the room she was now in, staring at the 
blank white walls while her love fought for her life.

&#145;I never even got to tell her I loved her&#133;&#146; the blonde thought, tears 
filling her eyes once more. She&#146;d been visited many times during the 
last few hours, worried crewmembers, the models, even Rei Hino had 
been near tears. Apparently the chill in the girl&#146;s attitude had more 
to do with envy then actual resentment. Lil had been by, her shock 
wearing off some, but she hadn&#146;t stayed long. She&#146;d returned to Mike 
as soon as it was possible, making the somber Haruka laugh slightly as 
the small girl threatened the doctors with tortured death if she 
couldn&#146;t see Mike. Chelle sat beside her now, petting her hand before 
yelping in surprise when Haruka shot up as the light went off, showing 
the operation was over.

&#147;Michiru&#133;&#148; Haruka whispered as the doors opened to reveal a stretcher 
with the aqua haired girl lying on it. Joy flooded Haruka&#146;s mind as 
the girl&#146;s eyes opened a little, a hazy drugged look in them.

&#147;She got through alright Haruka, you can relax.&#148; Mamoru murmured, 
tugging his gloves off as a nurse handed him a chart to sign before 
continuing, &#147;The bullet just nicked the bottom of her left lung, but 
it didn&#146;t go any further. Loss of blood is our main worry right now, 
but we think she&#146;s out of the woods. You can go see her during 
visiting hours, but I suggest you let Chelle take you home to get some 
sleep. You look like crap and you smell pretty bad too.&#148; The dark 
haired man laughed, slapping Haruka on the back before leading her 
over to Chelle. Haruka agreed, but only because a new plan formed in 
her mind. Something that required her to make a few stops on the way 
home.

&#147;I&#146;ll drive myself. I have some things to do. Chelle, call Usagi and 
tell her something has come up, that she&#146;ll have to finish the last 
week and a half of the shoot by herself. She can handle it if she can 
get the models to stop crying.&#148; Haruka murmured, a smile curving her 
lips as she walked with her secretary out of the hospital. Chelle 
nodded, going to her own car. She may have suffered a bit today, but 
she was still the best secretary in the country.

The smile curving Haruka&#146;s lips only widened as she made her way home, 
stopping at all the places she needed to go&#133;

~ * ~

A knock sounding at the door roused Michiru from her light slumber, 
making her open her eyes groggily as she peered up at whoever was 
bothering her. A small smile tugged at the edges of her mouth as she 
saw Haruka walk slowly into the room.

&#147;Hey Ruka&#133;&#148; Michiru whispered with a slight slur to her words, still 
slightly drugged.

&#147;Hello Michiru&#133;&#148; the blonde whispered mysteriously, leaning over to 
kiss the stunned girl&#146;s forehead before sitting down in the chair 
close to her bed, placing a small bunch of pink and white roses in 
front of her, one red rose in the center.

Michiru pouted mockingly, plucking the one red rose out while looking 
over at Haruka, &#147;only one red rose? I think I could&#133;cry&#133;&#148; she trailed 
off as she looked at the single rose she&#146;d pulled from the bunch. Tied 
to the long stem was a silver ring, a dark sapphire surrounded by tiny 
diamonds staring back at her.

&#147;W-what&#133;?&#148;

Haruka leaned over, silently untying the ring before sliding it onto 
the stunned Michiru&#146;s left ring finger before softly kissing the 
knuckle.

&#147;I know I&#146;ve only known you a few weeks&#133;Michiru Kaioh&#133;but I love you. 
I love you more then the moon loves the earth. More then the sand 
loves the ocean&#133;&#148; Haruka whispered, making Michiru giggle slightly, a 
blush making her usually pale cheeks crimson, &#147;when I thought I lost 
you, I died inside. I died again and again every time I saw another 
doctor or nurse run into the room you were in while I was trapped 
outside. I never want to be without you. Never again. I want to wake 
up with you in my arms and go to sleep the exact same way. Please&#133;just 
put me out of my misery. Michiru Kaioh, will you be with me? Be my 
wife?&#148; Haruka asked, pain lacing every word as she gazed up at 
Michiru. Michiru opened her mouth, but words were choked from her so 
she simply nodded, tears filling her eyes as Haruka smiled, leaning up 
to kiss her gently, being sure not to press into her, or hurt her.

&#147;Will you shut up! That was so romantic!&#148;

&#147;She&#146;ll never live that down.&#148;

&#147;Shut up Mike! You&#146;ll ruin it!&#146;

&#147;You&#146;re the one spying on them.&#148;

&#147;I didn&#146;t want to interrupt!&#148;

Haruka laughed as the whispered words from outside the door became 
louder, making Michiru laugh as well when Lil finally peeked inside 
the door, smiling sheepishly as she crept into the room, clearing her 
throat.

&#147;Er&#133;we&#133;weren&#146;t there&#133;too long&#133;&#148; the British blushed, swatting at Mike 
as Haruka&#146;s cousin leaned down to kiss the back of her neck.

&#147;We&#146;ll go now. Come puppy&#133;&#148; Mike laughed, winking at Haruka before 
tugging her girlfriend away.

&#147;Now, where were we?&#148; Michiru asked softly before covering Haruka&#146;s 
lips with her own&#133;

~ * ~

&#147;I now pronounce you&#133;Man and Wife. You may kiss the bride&#148; the white 
haired man murmured before Haruka took Michiru into her arms, kissing 
her as she heard a few of her friends burst into laughter over the 
&#147;man and wife&#148; part. The blonde didn&#146;t think they&#146;d stopped giggling 
gleefully since it began. The reception was held in one of the lower 
levels of the Ten&#39;oh inc. building fashioned like a ballroom with a 
round stage in the center. A piano and a violin sat ready as the 
wedding guests filed into the room. Haruka walked in with Michiru on 
her arm, gaining the attention of most of the guests. Looking around, 
Haruka smiled as she saw her cousin/best man sitting with a very 
giggly Lil on her lap, gleefully snapping pictures of everything in 
the room. Rei waved to Michiru, a warm smile playing on her lips as 
she gave the girl a reassuring smile. Setsuna waved as well, giving a 
knowing smile before hushing the swooning models beside her. Usagi 
glanced at her watch, most likely worrying over the deadlines of the 
next photo shoots. The Girl never stopped working. Mamoru stood by her 
side, raising a flute of white liquid. Baileys. (AN: LOL! Inside 
joke&#133;)

Haruka smiled at all of them, leading Michiru up onto the stage while 
everyone sat down. They&#146;d changed out of their wedding clothes; Haruka 
into a handsome white tux while Michiru wore a beautiful blue gown. 
She stepped forward, picking the violin up from its stand as Haruka 
sat down at the piano. As soon as everyone was seated, the two began, 
playing a perfect combination duet.

Michiru looked out at all of her new friends before looking up, as if 
she could see her mother standing before her.

&#145;I hope you can see me mum&#133;I miss you&#133;I love you so much&#133;I&#146;m 
fulfilling your dreams mum&#133;I wish you were here&#133;&#146; the woman thought 
silently, a soft smile playing on her lips as a slight breeze wrapped 
around her, making her turn to her lover. Haruka stood behind her on 
the stage, holding out one hand to her, which Michiru gratefully 
accepted, before leading her out onto the dance floor as the band took 
the stage.

There in the arms of her lover, Michiru smiled, feeling suddenly at 
peace with herself and the world. As she turned to the doors, she 
stopped a moment, seeing a woman with long aqua hair in a white 
flowing dress. Then she blinked, and the woman was gone.

&#145;I love you too mum&#133;I love you too&#133;&#146; Michiru thought before turning to 
her lover, looking into Haruka&#146;s teal eyes adoringly before whispering 
the words she&#146;d be saying the rest of her life.

&#147;I love you Haruka&#133;I&#146;m glad I never looked back&#133;&#148;
