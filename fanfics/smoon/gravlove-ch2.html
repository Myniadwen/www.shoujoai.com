<h1>Gravity of Love (part 2 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/gravlove-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Serena sat in the quiet caf&eacute; that beautiful afternoon. A young woman was 
reciting poetry on the small stage. The blonde sipped her coffee calmly. 
A little too bitter for her tastes, but overall not bad.

&quot;Sorry I&#39;m late.&quot;

Serena turned around as Becca approached her table, smiling 
apologetically. The waitress was clad in a black blouse and black jeans, 
very different from last night&#39;s showy outfit Serena noticed as the 
younger woman sat down.

&quot;Have you been waiting long?&quot;

&quot;No, ten minutes tops.&quot;

&quot;Good. I didn&#39;t want to keep you waiting.&quot;

A waitress soon arrived to get Becca&#39;s order of Black Colombian coffee. 
They were silent until the drink arrived.

&quot;So, what did you need to talk about?&quot;

The dark haired woman sipped her drink quietly. Serena waited patiently, 
though slightly nervous for some unknown reason.

&quot;Serena, we both know Minako&#39;s the wild type of girl.&quot;

The blonde nodded, waiting for the waitress to continue.

&quot;I&#39;m serious about her, I like her a lot.&quot;

Serena nodded again. Nothing she couldn&#39;t tell from last night.

&quot;But, I don&#39;t know how to keep your cousin&#39;s attention.&quot;

Becca blushed faintly when the blonde started to laugh hysterically. 
After several minutes, Serena managed to compose herself somewhat and 
look at the woman across from her.

&quot;Becca, you have no problem keeping Minako&#39;s attention. My cousin is 
crazy about you!&quot;

The violet-eyed woman smiled, sighing in relief. &quot;That&#39;s good. It&#39;s 
pretty hard to keep Minako&#39;s attention.&quot;

Serena nodded sympathetically. Her cousin went through more lovers a 
week than she went through outfits, and that says a lot. But someone 
managed to snag and keep her attention. Of course, the blonde could 
understand why Minako chose Rebecca. It was a change from the brunette 
cuties or blonde airheads she was usually with. Becca was the dark and 
mysterious type, completely opposite of the superstar.

&quot;So, Serena, what does Mina like besides singing, boys, women, shopping 
and partying?&quot;

The older woman blinked, suddenly baffled. What did her cousin like 
besides the obvious?

&quot;Well... she loves volleyball. And video games are her secret 
obsession...&quot;

Rebecca nodded, clearly surprised by the answer, not that Serena would 
blame her. Actually, the blonde laughed seeing the expression on her 
companion&#39;s face. The dark-haired woman smiled, clearly unaffected by 
the other woman&#39;s amusement. Serena stopped and stared at the waitress. 
She didn&#39;t understand how she could be so calm and collected over 
everything. The blond almost wanted to believe that she was a bit cold 
and distance. But Becca cares about Minako, so, she can&#39;t be bad. Right?

&quot;Any other advice?&quot;

&quot;Well... don&#39;t do anything clich&eacute;. I mean, Nako-chan gets flowers, 
candy, cards and jewelry all the time. Do something... different. 
Something she&#39;d never expect.&quot;

Rebecca&#39;s face fell. Serena felt her heart skip a bit at the sight of 
the downcast eyes and the slight frown that marred the waitress&#39; 
features.

&quot;Even if I were planning to, I couldn&#39;t.&quot;

The blonde remained quiet, waiting for the waitress to continue. She 
couldn&#39;t deny the fact that she was curious. Actually, she wanted to 
know everything she could about the woman sitting across from her. And 
she had no idea whatsoever why. Becca was Minako&#39;s. Not that she was 
attracted to Becca. She was, but not. Argh!

&quot;That&#39;s another thing. Why would she choose to be with me? She has 
money, fame and can have anyone she wants. Me? I&#39;m struggling to 
survive.&quot;

Serena leaned forward, placing a hand over the waitress&#39; and squeezed 
softly. Her heart went out to Becca completely. Minako&#39;s position could 
be very intimidating sometimes.

&quot;I mean, I&#39;m keeping two jobs to pay for rent and college.&quot;

The Tsukino daughter studied the woman before her. There was so much 
more about her than meets the eye. And that made her want to learn more 
about the mysterious waitress all the more.

&quot;What about your parents?&quot; Serena asked tentatively.

&quot;I&#39;m an orphan.&quot;

A gasp echoed in the otherwise quiet caf&eacute;. The blonde gave Becca&#39;s hand 
yet another squeeze.

&quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I shouldn&#39;t have asked!&quot;

Becca looked up, smiling weakly. &quot;It&#39;s all right. How were you supposed 
to know? Besides, I accepted it a long time ago.&quot;

Serena remained silent. The sympathy she felt for his woman was 
overwhelming. She just wanted to envelope her in a huge hug and not let 
go until she was sure Becca felt better. Out of the corner of her eyes, 
the older woman saw the clock on the far wall. She had dinner plans with 
Mamoru in a short while. But, she couldn&#39;t just leave Becca here...

&quot;Hold on a second, I&#39;ll be right back.&quot;

Serena stood, taking her purse with her. She walked out of the caf&eacute; and 
pulled out her cell phone. No matter how much she loves Mamoru, they had 
forever ahead of them. But how many times would she get to help someone? 
Hitting the speed dial, she smoothed down her skirt.

&quot;Hello?&quot;

The blonde smiled brightly just at the sound of her fianc&eacute;&#39;s voice.

&quot;It&#39;s me, Mamo-kun.&quot;

&quot;Oh, hey, Usako.&quot;

Faint pink coloring tainted the blonde&#39;s cheek. Only Minako and Mamoru 
were allowed to call her by her given name Usagi and only Mamo-kun used 
it. Ken Tsukino changed it when he became mayor of Tokyo, something his 
daughter always hated him for. Serena sounded more mature and 
sophisticated to him.

&quot;Mamo-kun, I&#39;m sorry, but I have to cancel our plans tonight.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; was the disappointed response.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry. It&#39;s just that my friend is upset about something and I 
can&#39;t leave her right now.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, Usako. I understand.&quot;

&quot;Thank you! Thank you, Mamo-kun! I&#39;ll make it up to you, I swear!&quot;

The famous actor chuckled as he bid farewell to his girlfriend. Yet, for 
some reason, he felt it would be the last time he&#39;d hear her voice for a 
very long time.

 

Serena walked back into the caf&eacute; where she found Becca staring at the 
stage and listening intently to the young singer. The blonde slipped 
back into her seat and smiled when the other woman turned to look at 
her.

&quot;Sorry, I forgot to call someone.&quot;

Becca saw clearly that there was something more the blond wasn&#39;t telling 
her. Nonetheless, she smiled back.

&quot;You don&#39;t have to stay. I&#39;ve already gotten the advice I was looking 
for.&quot;

Serena smiled warmly and sipped her now cold coffee. She had a face and 
eyed the cup wearily, something that made the younger woman with her 
smile.

&quot;It&#39;s fine! Besides, I rarely get to just enjoy an evening at a caf&eacute; 
while having some good conversation.&quot;

The politician&#39;s daughter knew it was worth canceling on Mamoru 
(something she never thought she&#39;d think) when Rebecca gave her the most 
beautiful smile she&#39;s never seen in her life. The way the violet eyes 
sparkled and she tipped her head forward ever so slightly causing her 
silky hair to slide over her shoulders made the blonde feel all bubbly 
inside.

&quot;So,&quot; Becca said suddenly as she waved a waitress over. &quot;Let&#39;s order 
another cup of coffee since yours is already cold and start conversing.&quot;

Serena giggled at the woman&#39;s bad attempt at a joke. The soft and sexy 
giggle that joined her own was intoxicating. The violet-eyed woman shook 
her head, sending raven locks everywhere as the waitress arrived.

 

 

~*~*~

Serena laughed as Rebecca finished her joke. She&#39;s never laughed as much 
as she has tonight! Not only was the waitress mature and fascinating, 
but she was hilarious and witty as well. Once the blonde managed to stop 
laughing, she noticed the employees were starting to clean up.

&quot;Oh my!&quot; Becca exclaimed suddenly. &quot;It&#39;s eleven already!&quot;

Serena&#39;s eyes widened. Eleven? Already?! Time had passed by so quickly!

&quot;We should go,&quot; the waitress continued as she stood.

&quot;Yeah, we should.&quot;

The two women walked out of the small caf&eacute;. Becca looked at the blonde 
walking besides her.

&quot;How are you getting home?&quot;

&quot;Bus.&quot;

&quot;No way,&quot; Becca said as she stopped. &quot;I&#39;m not letting you take the bus 
this late.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s fine. I do it all the time.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Rebecca said as she unlocked the passenger door of a blood red 
Porsche. &quot;I&#39;ll drop you off.&quot;

Serena looked at the leather interior as she began to get in. Didn&#39;t 
Becca have two jobs just to support herself? Where would she find the 
money for this car? Blue eyes flashed with confusion as she opened her 
mouth to speak.

&quot;How can you afford-&quot;

Everything went black when she felt a sharp pain at the back of her 
neck.

 

 

 

 

~*~*~

The blonde groaned. Her head was pounding. Suddenly, her blue eyes 
snapped open, remembering what happened. Well, remembering parts of what 
happened. She was getting into Becca&#39;s care and about to ask her how she 
could afford such a nice ride when...

Everything went black.

And wherever she was wasn&#39;t so much brighter either. Her arms and back 
were extremely sore. Trying to move her arms, she felt the cold metal of 
handcuffs that kept her hands behind the back of the uncomfortable chair 
she sat in. Her legs were chained to the legs of the wooden chair.

She began to panic. Where the hell was she?

The blonde looked down at herself. Her clothes were still on, just a bit 
ruffled. The door suddenly opened and her eyes snapped to the person 
entering.

Shocked was the only way to describe how she was when she saw the woman 
that entered. The anger and confused glare didn&#39;t even faze the woman. 
She placed a tray of food on a broken-down coffee table. It was then 
Serena realized she was starving.

&quot;So, you&#39;re awake. I was starting to think I hit you too hard.&quot;

The blonde frowned. How long has she been out? And what the hell was the 
woman up to? She couldn&#39;t help but feel betrayed.

Seeing the expression on the girl&#39;s face, her abductor spoke. &quot;You&#39;ve 
been out for sixteen hours.&quot;

Blue eyes widened. Sixteen hours? Surely, someone would have noticed she 
was gone!

&quot;Oh, don&#39;t worry,&quot; came the smooth drawl. &quot;All have Tokyo is looking for 
you.&quot;

Serena smiled smugly. She&#39;d be out of this situation in no time!

&quot;I won&#39;t let them rescue you that easily, princess. No, not quite yet.&quot;

&quot;Why, Rebecca?&quot;

The violet-eyed girl chuckled softly, closing her eyes. She pulled a 
chair and sat down, facing Serena and leaning against the back of the 
chair. The blonde realized what caught her attention just then, Despite 
Rebecca&#39;s front, she always knew the waitress was hiding something. She 
wasn&#39;t what she appeared to be. Now, it was out in the open and it was 
much darker than the blonde had expected.

&quot;Since I knocked you out and all,&quot; the woman said as she tilted her head 
and looked up at the ceiling thoughtfully, &quot;I suppose it&#39;s only fair to 
tell you my name is not Rebecca.&quot;

Serena nodded, though still somewhat shocked by the confession. But it 
made sense. She shouldn&#39;t really be surprised.

&quot;Who are you then?&quot;

The kidnapper smirked, hearing the fear in the soft voice. The 
politician&#39;s daughter might have learned a few things from daddy about 
putting up a front, but her eyes betrayed her.

&quot;Why should I tell you?&quot;

&quot;Like you said, I think it&#39;s only fair.&quot;

&quot;Rebecca&quot; laughed, raven hair cascading down her shoulder and framing 
her pale face. She regarded her prisoner with a mix of amusement and 
seriousness.

&quot;Considering what I&#39;ve done, fair doesn&#39;t exactly carry too much wait.&quot;

Cerulean eyes narrowed, forming a hate filled glare aimed at the 
waitress. Hell, she probably wasn&#39;t a waitress, the blonde realized as 
she pouted slightly in frustration. The kidnapper shook her head against 
and stood, walking behind her prisoner. Serena began to panic, until she 
felt the handcuffs being removed. But that didn&#39;t exactly do much 
either. She watched in confusion as the dark haired woman turned the 
placed the tray of food in the chair she previously occupied.

The woman caught her gaze and snorted softly. &quot;I may not be fair, but I 
have enough common sense to feed my hostages.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s glare worsened as she pushed the tray away slightly. &quot;No, 
thank you.&quot;

Okay, she may have been abducted, but there was still no reason to be 
rude.

&#39;Dear lord,&#39; Serena thought with a groan. &#39;What on Earth is wrong with 
me?! Manners during a time like this?&#39;

The woman approached again, the handcuffs ready. &quot;All right then, back 
on these go.&quot;

&quot;On second thought,&quot; Serena said quickly, &quot;I am a little hungry.&quot;

Ruby lips smirked as she sat down on one of the two beds and watched the 
blonde inhale her food. The smirk turned into a small smile as violet 
eyes closed.

&quot;So, why did you kidnap me?&quot;

The woman on the bed leaned against the headboard and allowed her 
shoulders to sag slightly. The smirk returned full force though she kept 
the amethyst depths closed.

&quot;Easy. Twenty million dollars.&quot;

Serena&#39;s eyes widened. &quot;You&#39;re holding me for ransom?&quot;

&quot;Rebecca&quot; opened her eyes and for a second, the blonde thought she 
detected a bit of sadness in the dark eyes. But it disappeared so 
quickly she convinced herself it was a trick of the dim lighting.

&quot;It&#39;s not that simple.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s brows furrowed as she tried to figure out what the woman 
meant. Finally, coming up with nothing, she spoke.

&quot;Then what&#39;s with the money?&quot;

The kidnapper&#39;s eyes locked onto those of the hostage, her expression 
grim.

&quot;I was hired to.&quot;

Serena felt her heart stop. What? She was hired to kidnap her? Her mind 
was reeling from the new piece of information. Who on Earth would want 
to kidnap her?

&quot;And,&quot; the blonde began, unable to hide her fear at all this time, &quot;what 
is your profession?&quot;

With one graceful movement, &quot;Rebecca&quot; was off the bed. She appeared 
Serena slowly, her eyes dark. The blonde&#39;s heart pounded in her chest. 
The kidnapper placed a hand on either side of the chair back her hostage 
sat on, leaning forward slightly as her eyes flashed.

&quot;Mercenary.&quot;

She paused, looking Serena straight in the eye.

&quot;Or assassin. Whichever they need.&quot;

The woman studied the blonde&#39;s wide eyes and the expression of utter 
dread and hopeless on her young face. Without the other noticing, she 
slipped the handcuffs back on before straightening and walking towards 
another door.

&quot;I&#39;m taking a shower. Don&#39;t try anything.&quot;

With that, she entered the bathroom, leaving the terrified and shocked 
Serena alone. Seconds later, the blonde was snapped out of her reverie 
when a raven head popped out of the door.

&quot;By the way, the name&#39;s Rei.&quot;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, I hope this answers the good old, &quot;Why is Rei Rebecca/ Who is 
Rebecca?&quot;

I think I might have twisted Rei&#39;s personality a bit in this, though I 
probably didn&#39;t. I like Rei being a bit dark. I mean, come on. The hair, 
the eyes and the attitude, that girl has the potential to be bad, really 
bad. But she won&#39;t be really, really bad in this. No worries.

Since this is an AU, a complete AU basically, there will be a lot 
character history mingled on with the later chapters. Most of it will 
pertain to Rei though, since I think I have the most to explain about 
her.

And as for a triangle... eh, not quite. It will be however, a kind of 
triangle later on, though I&#39;m sure you guys can figure it out and no, it 
does not involve Minako, unfortunately.</pre>
