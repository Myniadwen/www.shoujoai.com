<pre>&quot;D... don&#39;t look at me!&quot;

For the first time Michiru knew her Ruka she heard the strong senshi
of the wind stammer.

&quot;Don&#39;t be such a baby, Ruka and come out! Now!&quot; Inpatient the young
violinist knocked at the door of the other woman&#39;s bathroom. &quot;I don&#39;t
want to be late to the party. And I don&#39;t want to give our enemies an
advantage.&quot;

&quot;But...&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry, Ruka. I won&#39;t laugh.&quot; Declared Michiru determined and
rolled her eyes. Then she put her long blue evening dress in order.
Her sea green hair fell over her shoulder and surrounded a pale face.
She put on some make up but it couldn&#39;t cover her tiredness. Two
dolphins jingled as the young violinist turned her head towards the
slowly opened door.

&quot;Don&#39;t make such a rebellion, Ruka. I won&#39;t get a heart attack by...&quot;
Michiru&#39;s voice died away as she watched Haruka who just clenched her
fists. She wore a long narrow evening dress she brought quickly this
afternoon. It glimmered golden in the light of the setting sun.
Michiru could not longer deny that the young car racer was indeed a
woman. Behind the thin cloth she could see every female outline.

She&#39;s so beautiful...

Haruka had even brushed her short blonde hair in a different way. She
didn&#39;t look like a tomboy anymore. Now she looked like a real lady.

&quot;I hate this dress.&quot; Declared Haruka and as she rose her head Michiru
recognized that she even used a little bit of the make up she gave her
one hour ago. Her deep green eyes shone angry and she blushed
slightly. &quot;I feel like a total jerk!&quot;

&quot;Well, sometimes you&#39;re one.&quot; Giggled Michiru and stepped nearer. &quot;But
at this party there&#39;re only women allowed.&quot; Critical she looked at her
and the young car racer blushed more. &quot;But something is missing.&quot; A
bright smile appeared on the young violinist&#39;s face and her cheeks got
redder. The tiredness disappeared from her eyes as she let go of the
golden amulet she always wore. It was a tiny heart that contained the
pictures of her dead parents. Carefully she hung the necklace around
Haruka&#39;s neck who watched her with disbelieve.

&quot;Michiru, I... I can&#39;t take this...&quot; stammered the young car racer and
wanted to give it back. But the young violinist just shook her head.

&quot;They always protect me. This evening they should protect you, Ruka.&quot;
A serious expression appeared on Michiru&#39;s face then she grinned at
the taller senshi. &quot;It should protect you from the men who will be all
crazy about you, you beauty.&quot;

She laughed as Haruka&#39;s face got darker.

&quot;Oh, Michiru! You&#39;re..&quot;

So nice. So lovely. So kind. So amiable.

&quot;I am your best friend and without me you wouldn&#39;t know what to do
this evening on this party.&quot; Michiru took her handbag and went over to
the front door.

Haruka watched her in silence.

Without you I wouldn&#39;t know what to do in my whole life.

The young car racer wanted to say something and Michiru who felt that
something changed looked up to her in attention. Motionless they stood
near the door and looked each other deep into the eyes. Then a honk
interrupted the almost magical atmosphere.

&quot;That will be our taxi.&quot; Haruka squinted and finally opened the door.

&quot;Didn&#39;t you forget anything, Ruka?&quot; With that smile Haruka loved so
much Michiru watched her shoes. The young car racer looked down and
registered that she wore her old comfortable sport shoes.

&quot;I guess you should use some stilettos.&quot;

&quot;O no! I wasn&#39;t born to be a lady.&quot; Groaned Haruka and stumbled down
the steps of the entrance staircase. The taxi driver already opened
the door for them and Michiru watched how her young car racer
disappeared in the car.

&quot;I know, Ruka.&quot; She whispered and suddenly her look was very sad.
Silently she sat down next to the taller senshi at the backseat.
Thoughtless she looked out at the window to the coloured ocean and
watched the sun set. Tears shimmered in her blue eyes but she didn&#39;t
cry.

I know, Ruka.

But it doesn&#39;t matter to me.

***

Blue eyes looked critical at the huge painting at the white wall. Red
lines were crossed with blue lines. Yellow dots filled the free space
between.

&quot;You don&#39;t like them, do you?&quot;

Michiru spun around and looked into the grinning face of Haruka. The
young car racer hold a plate with tiny fruit pieces in her hands.

&quot;Well, actually I don&#39;t understand why this painting is called
&gt;Destiny&lt;.&quot; She observed the painting again and shook her head.

&quot;And I don&#39;t understand why it costs 100.000,00 Yen!&quot; declared Haruka
and ate a apple piece.

&quot;Because it is made for idiots who thinks they&#39;re intelligent because
they think they can understand the artist and his work.&quot;

&quot;I understand your works. Your endless oceans, your free dolphins.
Your dark forests and your endless skies.&quot; It should sound mocking but
as Michiru looked up she saw a very serious expression on Haruka&#39;s
still grinning face.

She&#39;s the only one who understands me. The only one who...

Michiru sighed slightly then she smiled encouraged.

&quot;Thanks. Then you must be very intelligent. I didn&#39;t realize that you
have so much talents.&quot; Joked Michiru and giggled as she could see how
Haruka rolled her eyes.

&quot;You would be surprised...&quot; whispered the young car racer and offered
her some fruits. Michiru just nodded and bit into a pear. Silently
both of them observed the wide room.

The taxi brought them to a skyscraper in the inner city. The party
took place at the huge apartment in the thirteenth story. Well, the
whole apartment was the thirteenth story. It belonged to an old man
who drew his own paintings. He was very known in the artist&#39;s world of
modern art. Michiru knew him for several years. They didn&#39;t like each
other very well because both of them didn&#39;t like the works of the
other one.

Mr. Snyder was born and grown up in America. Two ages ago he married a
woman from Japan and moved to the islands. His wife dies by a car
accident and so he had been alone with his daughter. Three years ago
his daughter disappeared from one day to another. She went to school
and never came home. Since this day Mr. Snyder searched desperately
after his daughter. That was the reason why he only invited women to
the parties he gave to represent his new paintings. Because he hoped
that one of the women would be his missing daughter.

Some musicians stood next to the door that leaded out to a huge
balcony where you could overlook almost whole of Tokyo. It was a very
bright and surely it was a very expensive apartment. There were five
musicians and they played Japanese Country music. It was his favourite
music. Some of the guests actually liked it. But some of them were
bored by it.

&quot;It&#39;s incredible!&quot; said Michiru quietly and watched a musician with an
old violin who missed two notes in one line. She knew the music, too,
but she had never heard it this terrible way.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. At least you don&#39;t have to dance.&quot; Replied Haruka and
ate another apple piece. Her green eyes were always in motion. She
searched for the slightest hint that their enemies were there. Michiru
could feel that the young car racer waited for a fight. That they
would found the talisman or at least got the chance to look into Mr.
Snyder&#39;s heart crystal. And then went home. Michiru knew that Haruka
didn&#39;t feel well in the long narrow dress. And the young violinist
couldn&#39;t imagine that she would ever get used to this terrible try of
the five men to make music.

&quot;You can&#39;t dance, can you?&quot; asked Michiru in surprise because she
thought that Haruka could do everything. Well, at least she behaved as
if she was able to reach every goal.

&quot;Not as a woman.&quot; Obstinately Haruka stared on her plate and slowly
ate the rest of the apple pieces.

Michiru rose her head and watched the young car racer silently for
some moments.

I&#39;d like to dance with you.

But she didn&#39;t dare to say it aloud.

&quot;Hey, Ruka! Don&#39;t eat everything! I didn&#39;t have any dinner, too!&quot;
Michiru grabbed Haruka&#39;s hand and took the last piece of apple. She
could feel how the taller woman winced as they touched.

&quot;Greed doesn&#39;t suit you.&quot; Mocked Haruka and laughed as the young
violinist made an angry face. &quot;Shall I take some more fruits from the
huge banquet? I really don&#39;t know who should eat all this food.&quot;

&quot;You! And then you&#39;ll be fat. A fat car racer.&quot; Now it was Michiru&#39;s
turn to laugh as she saw the confused expression in two green eyes.
Haruka lowered her head and observed her body.

&quot;The pizza last evening was too much, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; asked she and looked
down at Michiru with that look that remembered her of a little puppy.
The young violinist couldn&#39;t resist her feelings. She rose her hand
and ran it tender through Haruka&#39;s short blonde hair. The taller woman
swallowed hard, but she didn&#39;t move.

What had begun as a kind gesture changed now in something different.
Michiru&#39;s hand froze but it rested between the soft strands. Loving
blue eyes looked up into startled green ones.

I want to dance with you.

What shall I say?

In that very moment both of them heard the exited voices next to the
banquet.

&quot;You took the last piece of the chocolate cake. That&#39;s not fair!&quot;

&quot;When you&#39;re so lazy! It&#39;s mine! Hey! Give it back! Now!&quot;

&quot;Fetch it if you can!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll regret this!&quot;

Michiru&#39;s hand fell down as she turned around and looked as surprised
as Haruka at the four girls who stood next to the huge balcony door. A
girl with two blonde plaits and a white dress run through the room.
She hold a plait with a brown cake in her hands. A taller girl in a
red dress followed her with an angry expression on her face. Her long
black hair covered her back and swirled through the air as she tried
to catch the other girl.

&quot;That&#39;s so embarrassing!&quot; sighed a tall girl and ran a steady hand
through her brown hair. She wore a dark green dress. Another girl with
a light blue dress stood by her side. She didn&#39;t react because she
looked the whole time in a big book.

&quot;Ami! You&#39;re as bad as them! Put this book away!&quot;

&quot;But, Mako... Tomorrow is a test in English and...&quot;

&quot;And you never missed a single word your whole life. You&#39;re the best
pupil in your class. And I guess you&#39;re even better in this language
than an English people. So put it away! Or I will be very angry about
you!&quot;

The girl bowed her head and her face that was surrounded by shoulder
long blue hair blushed.

&quot;Gomen, Makoto-san.&quot; She said and the tall girl laughed.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. Just put it away. That&#39;s all I ask of you, Ami. Put it
away, take a apple or a roll - they look really delicious - and enjoy
yourself.&quot; Answered Makoto and rolled her eyes as she watched the
other two girls still arguing about the cake.

Ami sighed helpless and looked around. Her light blue eyes grew wide
as she recognized the two young women at the other side of the huge
room. Slowly she crossed it and stood at the next moment by the side
of Haruka.

&quot;Hi.&quot; She smiled and the words she wanted to say died away as she saw
Michiru&#39;s warning look. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Ami asked instead
and didn&#39;t say anything about the dresses she admired.

They must have been very expensive.

The senshi of the water didn&#39;t want to think about her dress she
borrowed from her cousin.

They both look really beautiful.

She felt grey next to them but cheered up as she saw the loving smile
on the young violinist&#39;s face.

&quot;I know Mr. Snyder and wanted to take a look at his new paintings.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s said that he lost his daughter and now searches for her.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s right.&quot; Michiru nodded and wondered how informed Ami was.
Always she seemed to know more than the others. The young violinist
hoped that the girl would never be her enemy one day. Or the one who
owned one of the talismans. Michiru wasn&#39;t sure if she would be able
to sacrifice her...

&quot;How sad...&quot; Ami sighed. Then she remembered something important.

&quot;Haruka, how are you feeling? Do you have any headaches? My mother
told me that it would have been better if we would have visited a
doctor. It&#39;s not funny to be beaten up by a stone.&quot; Her light blue
eyes observed Haruka, but she couldn&#39;t see any weakness. As ever.

&quot;A stone?&quot; whispered Michiru shocked.

&quot;She didn&#39;t tell you?&quot; Ami seemed to be really surprised.

As Michiru wanted to reply anything the others came over to them.

&quot;I don&#39;t believe it! She ate the whole cake!&quot; Rei looked frustrated
and Usagi grinned happy. Her mouth was brown and the white dress got
some brown spots. Makoto just smiled tortured.

The music increased and Michiru took a deep breathe. Silently she
watched Haruka who stared again on her empty plate.

She didn&#39;t tell me anything about the incident. But why? I thought I
am her best friend? I thought she trusts me. Doesn&#39;t she?

The young violinist swallowed hard and looked away.

Well, not anymore...

Ami noted their reactions and frown her forehead.

&quot;Hell, this music is driving me crazy!&quot; declared Makoto and couldn&#39;t
help to stare at Haruka. She&#39;d never realized that the young car racer
was indeed a woman. Yes they all knew it. But actually she&#39;d never
seen her so female before. The others were as puzzled as she was.

&quot;That&#39;s a nice dress. Where did you buy it?&quot; asked Usagi who didn&#39;t
see the warning looks of the others and touched the velvet cloth of
Haruka&#39;s dress. &quot;It&#39;s a nice colour. And it changes with the daylight.
It must have been very expensive, wasn&#39;t it? O, I dream of ever
wearing such a nice dress.&quot; Declared Usagi and looked innocently up as
Haruka automatically stepped back until the wall bared her only way of
flight.

&quot;But this dress is also nice, isn&#39;t it?&quot; she said as the young car
racer didn&#39;t reply anything. &quot;Mamo-chan has brought it for me. It is
very sad that he can&#39;t be with me this evening. But Mr. Snyder just
invited girls. And otherwise Mamo-chan has a seminar this evening. But
it would be fantastic to dance with him this evening.&quot; Dreamed Usagi
and a honest smile appeared on her redden face.

&quot;To this music?&quot; whispered Makoto and made a face.

&quot;With her talent to dance? Poor Mamoru!&quot; answered Rei and got a angry
look of Usagi.

&quot;You&#39;re just jealous!&quot;

&quot;What? Me?&quot;

&quot;By the way, what are you doing here?&quot; asked Michiru and interrupted
the starting argument.

&quot;Well...&quot; begun Usagi and stopped at the warning look of Rei.

&quot;It&#39;s for a school project. About modern art.&quot;

That was an excuse everyone always accepted. Because they couldn&#39;t
tell the two that they were at the party because of a bad vision of
Rei. Could they?

Usagi was convinced that Haruka and Michiru were friends. But the
others hesitated. So they decided not to tell them about the Sailor
Team.

&quot;But you&#39;re in different classes, aren&#39;t you?&quot;

For the first time Haruka interrupted the rule and asked for more
information after they told her the magic word school project.

&quot;Well...&quot;

At that very moment they heard how the class of the huge windows
broke. A ugly youma entered the room. Fast he reached the old man and
tried to beat him. The rest of the female guests screamed and escaped
through the doors towards the lifts. So did the Sailor Team. Just
Haruka and Michiru stayed.

&quot;At last!&quot; sighed Haruka as she rose her golden henshin.

&quot;You couldn&#39;t await to tear your dress off your body, could you?&quot;
asked the young violinist and giggled as she took out her henshin out
of her handbag.

Haruka turned her head and stared confused at the smaller senshi.

&quot;You should wear a dress more often, Ruka.&quot; Whispered Michiru and
blushed. Then she concentrated on the youma and rose her henshin, too.

***

Fearful looked the old man at the youma who came nearer. This time it
was a woman who resembled a modern painting. Her head seemed to be
were her right hand should be and the right hand had changed her place
with her left food. A hole in her belly allowed observers to see what
was behind her. Her dark eyes shone angry and full of hate. In her
left hand she hold a gun with which she could pull out the heart
crystal out of human&#39;s bodies. Mr. Snyder screamed in pain as she did.

&quot;Look if it&#39;s a talisman, Uranus. I&#39;ll take care for this...
creature.&quot; Michiru ran towards the youma who realized her.

&quot;Deep...&quot; screamed Sailor Neptune but she couldn&#39;t finish her
sentence. The power of the youma hit her suddenly. The young woman
lost hold and was thrown out of the balcony door. She winced as she
felt the pain in her body but at she was able to grab the handrail of
the balcony.

&quot;Shit...&quot; whispered Neptune as she saw the city under her. The cars
looked like toys thirteen story above. The youma left Mr. Snyder and
the crystal that flew over his silent body in a bright light.

&quot;Now I will kill you. At last! You have foiled all my plans! You
didn&#39;t do it without any consequences!&quot; The youma stood now at the
balcony and looked down at the defenseless senshi of the wide ocean.
&quot;Now you will regret your intervention!&quot;

The modern art woman rose her head and Michiru automatically closed
her eyes.

&quot;EARTH SHAKING!&quot; Haruka pulled her henshin down and observed how the
planet grew bigger and hit the youma who stepped back and screamed in
pain. Sailor Uranus didn&#39;t even look at the heart crystal as she ran
towards the balcony. She jumped and landed hard. At the last moment
she could catch the falling hands of the taller senshi who could not
longer hold on the handrail.

&quot;What the hell...&quot; whispered Michiru and opened her eyes. They grew
wide as she saw how the youma stood up and again came towards them.
&quot;You jerk! What have you done?!&quot; screamed the senshi of the wide ocean
and suddenly tears run over her pale cheeks. &quot;One of us must survive
to full fill the mission! Now you can&#39;t even defend yourself!&quot; She
didn&#39;t look down the street that was several hundred meters below.
Wind drove through her uniform and she shivered. Sailor Uranus didn&#39;t
say a word. She just hold her hands tighter and bit on her lower lip
as she tried to raise her back on the safe balcony.

&quot;I am too heavy!&quot; declared Michiru and swallowed hard as she felt that
there was no ground under her trembling feet. &quot;Leave me and save
yourself as we once promised. Save yourself and the world.&quot;

&quot;Never!&quot; declared Haruka and lifted her up some inches. But it would
take some more moments until Neptune would be safe and secure on the
ground of the balcony. Moments they didn&#39;t have.

&quot;Ruka, please...&quot; demanded the smaller senshi and couldn&#39;t fight back
a scream of fear as her stilettos fell down a long way down to the
street.

&quot;Shut up, Michi-chan.&quot; Yelled Uranus as the first beat of the youma
hit her. The pain ran through her body and she had to use all her
powers not to let go of the hand of Neptune. &quot;Don&#39;t you know that I
would never leave you, you stupid...&quot; Uranus&#39;s voice died away as the
second beat hit her. Her body arched incredibly and she felt how she
lost control over her trembling hands.

Don&#39;t...

&quot;Ruka!&quot; The scream of Neptune took away the darkness that waited for
the senshi of the wind. The pain increased but she just bit on her
lower lip and lifted the smaller woman some more inches. Just some
seconds and she would be safe and secure. Just two seconds and...

The third beat hit Uranus and she didn&#39;t had the power to hold her
anymore.

NO!

At that moment two hands reached for Neptune&#39;s and together they were
able to lift her back on the balcony. The senshi of the wide ocean
sobbed. Then she looked up and saw Sailor Jupiter who just smiled at
her.

&quot;That&#39;s been really tight.&quot; Answered the inner senshi and turned away
to help her partners. But she didn&#39;t have to help them anymore. Sailor
Moon already defeated the youma with her mighty henshin and now they
gave the heart crystal back to Mr. Snyder.

Sailor Neptune came hard to her feet. Slowly she walked over to the
old man. Sailor Moon kneeled at his side. Blue eyes looked innocently
up in a tear wet face.

&quot;You didn&#39;t even look if it&#39;s a talisman.&quot; Whispered the senshi of the
ocean stunned and shook her head. &quot;You just let this chance go to find
one talisman and to full fill our mission.&quot; Sailor Neptune spun around
and looked at Sailor Uranus who just stared at the ground of balcony.
&quot;What have you done? It&#39;s our mission to save the world! One of us has
to survive! When we both die the whole world will die! Didn&#39;t you say
that we have to make sacrifices to save this world? That every
sacrifice is worth for saving thousands of people?!&quot; Now Sailor
Neptune yelled at the still kneeling woman. The uniform was now red
and Michiru knew that Haruka was bleeding. The pain was surely
incredible but the senshi of the wind still didn&#39;t look up. For the
first time Michiru was really angry about her young car racer.

&quot;You always said that everything is less important than our mission!&quot;

&quot;What for a mission?&quot; asked Sailor Mars.

&quot;What is a talisman?&quot; asked Sailor Mercury and looked up from her tiny
computer.

&quot;Why are you arguing?&quot; asked finally Sailor Moon and tears were now
shinning in her eyes, too.

&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; yelled Neptune and Uranus with one angry voice.

Slowly the senshi of the wind came on her feet and walked over to the
senshi of the wide ocean.

&quot;He didn&#39;t have a talisman.&quot; Declared Uranus with a cold voice.

&quot;How could you be so sure? You didn&#39;t even look at it!&quot;

Haruka just shook her head. A thin smile appeared on her dirty face.
I didn&#39;t have to. I love you too much, Michi-chan. I&#39;d rather die with
you than to live without you. Don&#39;t you know?

But she knew that the smaller woman didn&#39;t.

&quot;Do you remember what you told me yesterday? That you couldn&#39;t
sacrifice me for the mission? Gomen. I am not able to sacrifice you
either.&quot;

Michiru rose her head and all the anger disappeared from her pale
face. Tears were still shimmering in her deep green eyes. Now she
stared at the taller senshi in confusion. In disbelieve.

&quot;Don&#39;t look at me this way!&quot; whispered Haruka then she sighed and
turned away.

What way?

Michiru watched her quietly. Even the inner senshi didn&#39;t dare to
break the silence.

&quot;Take a taxi.&quot; Said Uranus loudly as she opened the door to the lifts.
&quot;Don&#39;t wait for me. It&#39;ll be late.&quot; With those words she entered the
lift and leaned against the walls. She pressed her icy hands over her
hot face as the doors were shut and the lift moved down.

I can&#39;t live this way any longer. But I can&#39;t live without her at the
same time.

&quot;Did you understand a single word?&quot; asked Mars puzzled and went over
to the still motionless old man.

&quot;He will be okay.&quot; Said Ami and shook her head. &quot;I&#39;ve never heard
anything about talismans before.&quot; She declared honestly and made a
note into her computer that she would visit the library the next day
to find out more about this topic.

&quot;Why can&#39;t you told us more? Don&#39;t you trust us, Sailor Neptune?&quot;
Sailor Moon spun around and she froze as she saw the empty place were
the senshi of the wide ocean had stand some seconds before.

&quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot; Whispered the future princess of Crystal Tokyo and
suddenly more tears filled her eyes.

&quot;Hey, at least they could have said &gt;Arigato&lt;. That&#39;s not too much,
isn&#39;t it?&quot; complaint Sailor Jupiter but she was glad that she could
help Sailor Neptune not to fall down on the street. Surely it would
have been a deadly fall...

&quot;Hai...&quot; whispered Ami and went over to the open balcony door and
looked out at Tokyo at night.

But she actually didn&#39;t listen to her partners.

***

Slowly Haruka stumbled over the old stones that covered the sandy way.
Huge trees laid shadows over the peaceful place. At night it was
forbidden to come to this place but the young woman simply climbed
over the wall. Her golden dress was now torn and she threw away her
stilettos some miles ago. Her hair looked messed and her face was
dirty. Her back was wet and the cloth pasted to it. Haruka knew that
it was blood but she didn&#39;t care about it.

In front of a black grave stone the young car racer fell on her knees.
She sighed deep and looked desperately at the inscription: Gendo and
Mareiko Kaioh. Michiru&#39;s parents were buried at this cemetery. They
died when the young violinist had been ten years old. Michiru didn&#39;t
often talk about them. But when she did her voice was full of love and
her look full of sadness.

They must have been great parents.

Haruka took the amulet in her trembling hands and looked at the
smiling pictures in it.

If I had such loving parents maybe I would&#39;ve never become the person
I am today...

The young car racer bowed her head and fought against the tears that
were burning in her eyes. Her head ached and her back made every
motion to a motion in pain.

&gt;You lesbian!&lt; Again she heard the voice in her head that didn&#39;t stop.
Again she saw the confused look in those blue eyes she loved so much.

&quot;Gomen...&quot; whispered Haruka and knew at the same time that there was
no mercy for her. No piece. No freedom at all...

A lightning crossed the black night sky above and thunder followed.
First rain trop fell down the dry earth. They felt cold at the hot
skin of the young woman. But she didn&#39;t actually realize it. She just
kneeled there and stared at the grave stone and remembered the mocking
words of her smaller senshi.

&gt;They always protect me. This evening they should protect you, Ruka.&lt;

Maybe they actually protected them both as they fought at the balcony
with the youma. Maybe they saved their lives in the form of the inner
senshi.

But they couldn&#39;t help her. They couldn&#39;t answer her questions. They
couldn&#39;t solve her problems. They couldn&#39;t change her feelings.

&quot;I... I...&quot; stammered Haruka and closed her eyes. &quot;I love your
daughter.&quot; Whispered the young car racer and fought successfully back
her tears. But she couldn&#39;t hold back a sob.

&quot;Gomen...&quot;

At this very moment the storm broke off.

***

The silver Ferrari drove through the dense rain. Great trop fell upon
the window pane and the light could hardly bring any brightness in the
dark street. Slowly it was parked by a big house where four families
lived. The young woman still wore her dirty blue evening dress. Her
sea green hair was wet and her blue eyes shone sad as she walked over
to the entrance and pressed the bell.

&quot;Hai?&quot; A girl in a violet pajama appeared tired at the door. Her light
blue eyes grew wide as she recognized the young woman.

&quot;Michiru! What are you doing here in the middle of the night? You&#39;re
all wet! Come in!&quot; Ami stepped back and guided the young woman to the
flat she lived in with her mother.

&quot;Did anything happen?&quot; asked the girl alarmed.

&quot;No.&quot; Michiru just shook her head and took a deep breathe.

Probably not.

&quot;My mother&#39;s still at the hospital. An emergency.&quot; Declared Ami as she
disappeared in the bathroom. &quot;Just sit down.&quot; She said to the young
violinist and went over to the fridge.

&quot;Arigato.&quot; Michiru took the towel to dry her hairs and sat down at the
round table in the middle of the small but comfortable kitchen.

&quot;Do you want a tea?&quot; asked Ami and already took a box out of the
cupboard.

&quot;Hai...&quot; Michiru sighed. &quot;Gomen. I know that you have to go to school
tomorrow. And now I disturb your holy sleep.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I was still learning some vocabularies.&quot; Ami smiled
confident and put two tumblers down on the table. &quot;Pay attention. It&#39;s
still very hot.&quot; She declared and looked into the pale face of the
young musician.

&quot;It&#39;s about Haruka, isn&#39;t it?&quot; asked the senshi of the water after a
while they drank their teas in silence.

&quot;Hai...&quot; whispered Michiru and didn&#39;t ask why Ami knew it. The girl
was very intelligent. And very sensible. Maybe she read too many books
and learned too much, but she was a very good friend. Michiru was glad
that they have met.

&quot;It&#39;s about the fight yesterday. Haruka didn&#39;t tell me about it, but I
want to know more about it. Because she&#39;s different now. And I can&#39;t
understand why.&quot; Michiru stared in her tea, unable to look into the
innocent face of the intelligent girl.

&quot;Well, it wasn&#39;t very pleasant. Rei was still at her seminar for young
priests and I sat on a bank in the park. I brought some books and so I
wasn&#39;t bored when Haruka came too late. She searched the whole day for
something but she didn&#39;t want to tell me. I don&#39;t know if she finally
found it, she didn&#39;t lose any word about it.&quot;

My ear rings.

Michiru rose her head a little bit and could hear the jingle of two
dancing dolphins.

&quot;I read one of my books as suddenly a rude man appeared next to me. He
tried to force me to give him a kiss and to go with him. I was too
weak to defend myself and...&quot; Ami blushed and sighed. &quot;Well, Haruka
came not a second too late. She didn&#39;t ask a lot and simply beat the
man down. She declared him that he should go away, but he put up a
stone and threw it at her. Then they started to fight again and
somehow he must have mentioned that Haruka&#39;s a girl. He seemed to be
very surprised. He looked at me and than at Haruka.&quot; Ami closed her
eyes and took a deep breathe. &quot;I&#39;ve never seen such a hateful look my
whole life before. He said that we are sick persons and that...&quot; Ami
shook her head. &quot;He was very rude and he said some more meanness and
called Haruka mad names. But finally he had to see that Haruka has
been too strong for him and we went away.&quot; Ami opened her eyes again
and they grew wide as she saw the tears in Michiru&#39;s.

&gt;Don&#39;t look at me this way!&lt;

The quiet voice of Haruka was still in her ears and now she seemed to
understand what way the young car racer actually had meant.

&quot;Afterwards we went to the optician, repaired my glasses and fetched
Rei. We went into a caf&eacute; and ate a big chocolate ice cream. Rei told
us a lot about her seminar and we laughed a lot. But...&quot; Ami stood up
and filled her tumbler again. &quot;But Haruka seemed to be concerned about
it. She would&#39;ve never admit it but she was a little bit quieter than
normal. A little bit more serious. But it could be because Rei had
been very exited and very loud this afternoon.&quot;

Michiru shivered as she remembered the hateful look of the fat man at
the parking space. How Haruka reacted afterwards.

She let go of my hands immediately.

The whole night the senshi of the wind drove her motorbike.

And she didn&#39;t want to talk to me about her problems.

&quot;How did the man call Ruka?&quot;

Ami looked up for some seconds and stared silently into two concerned
blue eyes.

Ruka... She always calls her this familiar way.

Then the senshi of the water stared back in her brown tea.

&quot;He said &gt;You lesbian&lt;.&quot; Ami&#39;s voice was very calm.

Michiru knocked over her tumbler.

***

It was dawn when Haruka entered the light house by the sea. The sun
rose from the endless ocean and the stars disappeared slowly one by
one. The waves shimmered mysterious in the light of the new day.

The young car racer opened the fridge and drank some gulps of milk out
of the bottle. But it couldn&#39;t cover the nausea in her stomach. Haruka
sighed and went through the living-room. She shivered as she followed
the corridor towards her room. It stopped raining about one hour ago
but the young woman was still wet to the skin, the dirty narrow dress
pasted to her shaking body. She had to sneeze as she entered her room
and closed the door quietly behind her. Her head ached and her back
mad out of every motion a torture. She froze and she felt very tired.

Just a shower and then to bed.

Haruka didn&#39;t mention that anyone had tidied up her room. No more
dirty clothes laid on the carpet and the books were brought in order
on the desk. And the young woman didn&#39;t see the shadow that laid on
the blanket of her now tidy bed.

&quot;Shit!&quot; swore the young car racer as she tried to get out of the wet
dress. Her back hurt and the pain robbed her breathe. She sat down on
the chair and looked out of the window. Silently she watched the
sunrise while she took a deep breathe to get her feelings again under
her control.

&quot;May I help you?&quot;

Haruka spun around as she heard the soft voice behind her and winced
by this inattentive motion. Quietly she watched how Michiru rose from
the bed and yawned.

&quot;I said you don&#39;t have to wait for me.&quot; Declared Haruka and returned
to stare out of the window.

&quot;I just wanted to know that you&#39;re home.&quot; Michiru stood behind the
chair and opened the zipper of the dress on Haruka&#39;s back. &quot;It was a
heavy storm and I was concerned that you wouldn&#39;t return at all.&quot;
Whispered the young violinist and looked sadly at the wounds. They
didn&#39;t bleed anymore but surely they did hurt a lot.

&quot;The youma did a god job, didn&#39;t she?&quot; asked Michiru quietly and
sighed as Haruka didn&#39;t answer. Silently she went into Haruka&#39;s
bathroom, took a flannel and carefully washed the dirt away from the
young woman&#39;s skin. Then she bandaged the back. Haruka winced but she
didn&#39;t turn away.

&quot;Are you ready now?&quot; asked the young car racer after Michiru had
finished.

Sadly Michiru watched her taller senshi some moments.

I want to understand you, Ruka. Please, let me be part of your life
and not only a partner for your mission. Talk to me Ruka!

But Michiru knew that the young car racer would never.

&quot;Hai...&quot;

Haruka pulled away the rest of the dress she would threw away the next
day. Then she pulled over a long white shirt she misused as pyjama and
climbed into her bed.

&quot;Are you cold?&quot; asked Michiru and wrapped her arms protectively around
her belly. Motionless she stood next to the empty chair and swallowed
hard.

Ruka is so different...

&quot;No! And now get out and leave me in peace!&quot; Haruka turned her burning
face towards the wall and pulled her blanket over her head.

&quot;I guess I would have reacted the same way you did.&quot; Michiru sighed
loudly, took the rest of the box of the first aid. &quot;Don&#39;t worry about
it, Mr. Snyder didn&#39;t have a talisman. And don&#39;t think about my
reaction. I overreacted a little bit. Maybe the shock of almost
falling down thirteen storeys of a skyscrapers.&quot; The young violinist
went over to the door and opened it. Before she left the room, she
turned her head and watched the body of her senshi of the wind for
some moments in silence.

&quot;I like you the way you are, Ruka.&quot; Quietly Michiru closed the door.

Haruka turned around and looked at the ceiling for the next hours
while she listened to the soft melodies of the violin.

She had to think about a lot of things.

At midday she finally settled into a deep but restless sleep.
