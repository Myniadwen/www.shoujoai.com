<h1>I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ashtree.html">ashtreemeadow</a><br> </h2>
<pre>A/N Hi this is my first fic. It is based off the song I Just Died in 
Your Arms Tonight by Cutting Crew. Enjoy and please give feed back. 

      Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight 
It must have been something you said 
I just died in your arms tonight 

      Haruka was driving along the highway out of Tokyo when Michiru 
turned the song on. 

      &quot;Turn it off, Michi-chan, onegai&quot; 

      &quot;Why?&quot; 

      Haruka looked at her lover and sighed. She loved Michru, and for 
all that Michiru was the most adept and understanding the mood, 
sometimes she could be a little dense. 

      Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight 
It must&#39;ve been something you said 
I just died in your arms tonight 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight 
It must&#39;ve been some kind of kiss 
I should&#39;ve walked away, I should&#39;ve walked away 

      &quot;Michi-chan, that song reminds me of the ocean&#39;s cathedral&quot; said 
Haruka quietly. 

      Michiru paled but did not turn off the song. She knew exactly what 
her lover meant. Barely one month ago Michiru and Haruka acting as 
Sailors Neptune and Uranus decided to take on the Death Busters and 
force them to give up the talismans to stop the silence. But the whole 
thing was a trap. Michiru and Haruka were the carriers of the talismans 
and were killed to have them removed. But the fiasco was not that 
simple. Michiru was badly injured and literally died in Haruka&#39;s arms 
that night as her talisman was wrenched out of her body along with her 
pure heart. 

      &quot;Ruka-chan that was not your fault, it was mine please don&#39;t- 

      &quot;Stop! Michi-chan it wasn&#39;t you who was stupidly watching you run 
at me to save from Eudial. It wasn&#39;t you who just watched as you were 
shot and watched your only loves&#39; heart was forced out was not YOUR 
FAULT.&quot; 

      As Haruka was saying this speech of self-recrimination, Michiru 
just watched as Haruka pulled over and put her head in her hands. 

      Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight 
It must&#39;ve been something you said 
I just died in your arms tonight 
Oh I, I just died in your arms tonight 
It must been some kind of kiss 
I should`ve walked away, I should&#39;ve walked away 

      &quot;Haruka, enough kicking yourself over what happened. Yes I died. 
You died too. But now we are alive we can move on and for now at least 
lets just be happy and enjoy the little peace we have.&quot; 

      &quot;Michiru, You are the wisest person I know but that disaster will 
always shadow my heart.&quot; 

      &quot;I never said that it wouldn&#39;t. I never say that you should forget 
what happened. But for now could you please just let go of your grief? 
Please?&quot; 

      Haruka looked at Michiru in shock and decided something right then 
that she knew that she would never regret. 

      &quot;Michiru, I love you. Never leave me again, ne?&quot; 

      &quot;Always, I will never leave you again.&quot; 

End
