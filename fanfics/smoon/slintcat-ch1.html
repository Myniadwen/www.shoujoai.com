******************************

When a butterfly flaps its wings, a tornado can wipe out cities on the 
other side of the planet. This more or less is a commonly known and 
simplistic description of chaos theory. What really is important about 
this is that every action causes a reaction in the endless struggle of 
life. Every event will lead to another one. All actions that we take 
will have their consequences, however unintentional, unconscious or 
unwanted. Sometimes we even have just a tiny bit control over our fate 
and are pulled along the flow of chaos that dominates our life, 
outside sources influencing our lives only further and provoking 
situation that are far beyond our control.
	This, in short terms, is what happened this night. On the 22nd 
of October in the year 2000 when a young woman was celebrating her 
21th birthday in a big manor just recently acquired through her rising 
success as a musical actress. Aino Minako was definitely someone who 
could look back on her young life and say honestly that she could not 
complain about many things. She had a decent, if somewhat uneventful 
childhood. A typical schoolgirl, chasing after cute boys and all that. 
Her life had changed drastically when she was made aware of her fate 
as the rebirth of Sailorvenus, the Senshi of Love and Beauty. But 
Minako had come to like her role and fit into perfectly, becoming the 
leader of the Inner Senshi, the guard of their beloved Princess 
Serenity, and lately a successful actress which was as close as 
possible to her dream of becoming an idol.
	So, all was well with Minako&#39;s life if not for the fact that her 
love life was pretty much non-existent. Oh, she had relationships, but 
none of them had ever held a serious quality, none of them had ever 
come close to the devotion she felt for her friend Usagi, the rebirth 
of their Princess. That was part of the problem with Minako. As the 
Senshi of Love she was able to practically bring any two (or more) 
people together if she had a mind to. She shouldn&#39;t have a problem 
doing that for herself you say? Theoretically you are correct. But the 
reality is rarely that rosy. The truth was that Minako put a lot of 
limitations upon herself. Walls around her deepest emotions and 
desires that built up over the years were preventing her from enjoying 
the wonders of true love herself. It was a complex set of boundaries, 
many of which the young woman didn&#39;t even understand herself and this 
story is no place to indulge in them like in a character study.
	Besides, there was nothing in the world that a bit (or a bit 
more) alcohol can&#39;t change. Especially inhabitations!
	So said, the seemingly young man - though in reality he was 
older than the average person would deem possible - with the 
particular purple hair and always-closed eyes set to work. He wasn&#39;t 
even invited, yet alone known - except maybe by two of the present 
time Senshi from whom only one from was in attendance - but that had 
never stopped him before. Besides, soon the only one who might be able 
to recognize him would be too busy with other, much more enjoyable 
matters.

******************************
	
	Kino Makoto sat together with her friend and recent roommate 
Tomoe Hotaru on the small bar of the big, hall-like room that had been 
cleared as the main area for their friend&#39;s birthday. She had gotten 
to know the younger girl quite well over the last months since the 
adopted child of Tennou Haruka aka Sailoruranus and Kaiou Michiru aka 
Sailorneptune had left the nest, so to speak, to search her own path 
in life, much to her &#39;father&#39;s&#39; displeasure. She had also come to 
learn a great deal about Hotaru&#39;s secrets, especially one that had 
shocked her pretty much. Yes, she had also suspected that the younger 
girl might have something akin to a crush on their leader, the honor 
guest of the evening, but she had not realized just how deep those 
feelings run and when Hotaru had confided to her in a moment of trust 
that her feelings were not just founded in this life but that her past 
life, many generations ago, had been the soul mate of the first Venus 
and that Minako was on a basic level very similar to the woman she had 
loved and still did, Makoto felt both flattered to be privy to such a 
secret but also a certain unease since she had harbored similar 
feelings for her blonde friend.
	The problem was, their mutual love interest was the furthest 
thing away from a healthy relationship prospect. She was pretty much 
going through boyfriends like a scissor would through paper. Those 
were pseudo relationships, acts to hold up a charade Makoto was sure 
none of them really were fooled by anymore. Aino Minako obviously was 
not interested in a real relationship, for some reason that was 
probably beyond her own knowledge shying away from true love. And so 
the chances for the two girls were probably barely above zero... if at 
all.
	The rest of their friends were gathered all around the room, 
some were even in other areas of the manor. Minako wasn&#39;t really one 
to brag of the house that had been sort of a gift from her boss or 
something like that. She wasn&#39;t even employing servants to keep the 
house clean and in order most of the time. Still, it was very 
convenient for parties and other such occasions. Right now, Makoto and 
Hotaru were alone on the makeshift bar. Usagi and Mamoru, their 
married, royal couple was dancing, as were Rei and her friend Sasami. 
The latter couple didn&#39;t even gave the Senshi pause anymore. While 
never openly admitted it was an unspoken fact that those two were 
together. Haruka and Michiru were lounging on the couches after 
dancing for the better part of half an hour! Ami was off somewhere 
else, Makoto didn&#39;t know exactly where and it hardly was that 
important.
	&quot;This is unfair,&quot; proclaimed Hotaru who was eyeing the birthday 
child who was merrily mixing with the couples in a way Makoto had not 
seen her do in a long time. It was clear that Minako had more than the 
one or other alcoholic drink in her system and as much as she came 
over as the strong, confident leader and grown woman these days, even 
the toughest warrior is going to falter under such intoxicating 
material after awhile...
	As was Makoto&#39;s partner in depressing solitude. &quot;She&#39;s flirting 
with them as if they were all still fresh on the market! And we are 
sitting here and being ignored!&quot; Hotaru further lamented.
	The brunette resolved to make sure never to expose Hotaru to 
that much alcohol again as she spared her friend an amused glance. She 
hadn&#39;t even drunk that much. Barely two glasses of wine or something 
along those lines. While Haruka and Michiru were present anything more 
would definitely go over their limit of tolerance. &#39;Some people just 
have a low tolerance level&#39;, Makoto supposed before replying aloud, 
&quot;Well, why are you sitting here then? You could go over there and make 
sure she notices.&quot;
	Hotaru acquired an expression of deep thought for all but one 
second before exclaiming, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s a fantastic idea!&quot; Then just as 
suddenly her mood dropped and she looked at her friend concerned. &quot;Why 
aren&#39;t you doing that yourself?&quot;
	&quot;Because I know that there isn&#39;t a chance, even if anything was 
about to happen tonight, it would not last past today,&quot; the brunette 
answered truthfully, still in possession of a more or less rational 
mind since she wasn&#39;t so easily swayed by a few drops. Besides, the 
Senshi of Protection wasn&#39;t even a heavy drinker in particular. None 
of the Senshi were but the occasion had called for something special 
and no one had really protested.
	A frown crossed Hotaru&#39;s features and her shoulders slumped in 
resignation. &quot;A good point. Then I won&#39;t go either.&quot;
	Makoto smiled slyly, &quot;You sure? I think YOU had a good chance of 
making it past tonight.&quot; There was a good deal of truth in it. Given 
the history behind their relationship it was more likely that Hotaru 
would succeed in fetching the blonde for herself. There were enough 
examples for Makoto to draw upon in the circle of her teammates to 
know that past life relationships - even if this far in the past - had 
a tendency to repeat themselves in their time. &#39;They are the best 
example&#39;, Makoto mused with a glance in Usagi and Mamoru&#39;s direction 
who had finally managed to get Minako to lay off by taking a momentary 
break. And if she couldn&#39;t have Minako, then maybe at least she could 
help Hotaru in her own pursuit.
	Yes, that was actually a good idea, her mind confirmed after 
taking another sip of her glass, neither of the girls having even 
noticed the shadow of a person next to them slipping something inside. 
Makoto had come to respect the younger girl a great deal and valued 
their relationship. She wasn&#39;t that desperate anyway and Hotaru seemed 
to match Minako much better anyway... Now, she just needed a plan of 
action. Preferably starting tonight while both their inhabitations 
were lessened. Granted, not the best basis for a relationship but what 
was there to lose?
	&quot;You think so?&quot; Hotaru said tentatively, unsure of herself.
	&quot;I bet,&quot; Makoto replied with newfound confidence. She didn&#39;t 
really know where the next comment came from. It was an off-hand 
remark, a joking statement to break the somber mood and get Hotaru on 
the path of taking some sort of action. She had no idea what 
long-reaching, unintentional consequences the comment would have for 
the lives of the three Senshi. &quot;Then again, you probably would have to 
get her pregnant in order to get Mina-chan to really notice you.&quot;
	Makoto&#39;s humorous smile fell into a perplexed expression when 
Hotaru countered in a dangerously calm voice that seemed to seriously 
contemplate the point, &quot;You think I couldn&#39;t do that?&quot;
	Thinking that Hotaru was pulling her leg the strongest Senshi of 
the Inner circle quirked an eyebrow. &quot;I&#39;d like to see you do,&quot; I 
quipped.
	&quot;That&#39;s an interesting idea,&quot; Hotaru remarked with a gleam in 
her eyes that made Makoto wonder briefly just what the heck was going 
in that pretty, little head of hers... Just before she analyzed that 
last train of thought and wondered where the heck that came from. 
&quot;Sure thing, Hotaru-chan,&quot; Makoto said sarcastically. &quot;You&#39;d have as 
much luck at that as I would.&quot;
	&quot;Is that a challenge?&quot;
	Makoto blinked and waited for all but two second before rising 
to the bait, the competitive Martial Artist in her not able to resist 
a good challenge as ridiculous as it might seem. &quot;You betcha.&quot; 
Obviously the alcohol was starting to affect her as well but at least 
this was maybe proving to make Hotaru try hard enough. And so Makoto 
watched with some amusement and an almost wistful smile as Hotaru 
bounded off to start bugging Minako for the rest of the night.
	Had Makoto paid any closer attention to her surroundings, she 
might have noticed the male form, obscured by the shadows watching 
those happenings with a satisfied expression. &quot;Everything&#39;s going just 
as planned,&quot; the man said happily and then, just as that, vanished 
from view altogether.

******************************

	Aino Minako hadn&#39;t had so much fun, or didn&#39;t allow herself to 
have so much fun for a rather long time. You only turned twenty once 
though, that was a special age for a Japanese girl-now-woman and so 
she had thrown most of her caution overboard, taking more than the one 
glass wine. Now the party was over, everyone had gone home, except the 
two girls currently sitting with her on the large bed. She had no real 
idea how she ended up in the master bedroom with her two friends. All 
that she did remember was that Hotaru had been flirting with her to a 
point where it was almost inhuman and downright crazy. But while her 
everyday self would probably have put a stop to this soon, her 
alcohol-induced state had lowered her shields considerable and she 
cheerfully played along. At one point Hotaru had made an odd request 
to borrow her Crescent Compact but the blonde woman hadn&#39;t thought 
much about it.
	Now Hotaru had, dragging Makoto along with some whispered 
comments, requested to settle down somewhere comfortable and that she 
had something to show them. A bit reluctant at first but quickly 
melting under the pleading and openly suggestive gaze of Hotaru, 
Minako had lead them to the master bedroom. It was apparent that those 
two were probably going to stay anyway, neither of them being in much 
of a condition to walk or even drive and Minako had never preferred 
the large chamber for herself anyway. At first it was neat, a big bed 
all to herself, but soon it had become lonely since there was usually 
nobody to share it with.
	Hotaru for her part was giddy with anticipation. Her rational 
mind that would probably have protested loudly at this point, was 
pretty much gone and left behind only the exposed girl/woman, the 
lonely outsider/Senshi that hadn&#39;t experienced the touch of her lover 
for twenty millennia. It was odd considering that actually her healing 
powers should give her a HIGH resistance factor to anything narcotic 
but that paradox didn&#39;t even register with her. Everything was 
prepared now. The plan that had hedged in her inhabitations-free state 
had come to fruition. She didn&#39;t mind that Makoto was there, too. In 
fact the kinship that she felt to the older girl - relatively spoken - 
had compelled her to include the brunette in the following happenings. 
After all, it wouldn&#39;t be a fair challenge if Hotaru had their 
unsuspecting soon-to-be lover all to herself, right? Of course, if 
everything went right, she was still going to win that challenge!
	&quot;Okay, here you go, Mina-chan.&quot; The dark-haired girl handed the 
compact back to its original owner. &quot;Now try it out.&quot;
	Minako cocked her head. &quot;Why?&quot;
	Hotaru smiled mysteriously. &quot;You&#39;ll see. Make it something 
complex. Like, visible physical changes and all that.&quot;
	Favoring the younger girl with a dubious look, she thought about 
something appropriate to use to humor the girl with. After all the 
compact wasn&#39;t meant to totally produce a physical alteration of the 
body. Yes, some changes could be physical to a degree but most of it 
was an illusion. Getting an idea she concentrated on the picture in 
her mind and called out the magic phrase.
	&quot;MOON POWER TRANSFORM! Turn me into a mysterious phantom thief!&quot;
	Minako wasn&#39;t really sure where exactly the thought came from, 
might be her resident aversion to policemen - though she had worked 
with a few as V. Be that as it may, the leader of the Inner Senshi 
immediately realized that something was very different when the change 
rippled over her. Several of the details that she had pictured seemed 
to be actually physical present. Blinking in astonishment she brought 
her hands up to remove the hat and felt along her face to come across 
the shape of peculiar pointed ears that she had added to her mental 
picture in a spur of inspiration. After all phantom thieves were 
supposed to be mysterious and you never knew what was underneath their 
costume, right?
	Makoto meanwhile had moved forward in wonder at the incredible 
sexy sight - even though she resolved that Minako had thought up way 
too much concealing clothes. The elfin ears were a nice touch but what 
really caught her attention was the hair. Moving forward on the bed 
she caught a few strands between her fingers and at Minako&#39;s inquiring 
gaze, stated, &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t think it was supposed to be that real. 
Those actually feel different.&quot; The brunette was referring to the fine 
strands of silvery-white mixed in the blonde hair that actually seemed 
to shimmer a bit more than usual.
	&quot;It isn&#39;t,&quot; Hotaru interjected with a triumphant smile. &quot;I 
played around a little with the makeup. Most of what was needed was 
already there and I only needed to change a few things. Now, you have 
an actual physical change!&quot; Minako gaped at that but was unable to 
deny the obvious truth. Not too mention that her focus was quickly 
directed elsewhere as she met the leering stares of the two other 
girls who had come dangerously close. &quot;This definitely has some 
advantages, wouldn&#39;t you say?&quot; Hotaru licked her lips.
	&quot;Oh yes, I have to agree. Very sexy,&quot; Makoto added, just running 
one palm over the fabric of the midnight blue cloak. &quot;A bit 
overdressed though.&quot;
	Minako suppressed a shudder. Since she had regulated herself to 
a high level of self-control in the last years a part of her self 
struggled against what she know was to come... for all but one second 
at least. The crushing kiss from Hotaru was ripping apart even the 
last barriers that the alcohol had left standing and all that she was 
able to coherently think was, Oh well. &#39;What the heck...&#39; The 
passionate onslaught that was hardly to be expected of a seventeen 
year old girl was irresistible and Minako felt herself moving with the 
flow as tongues began to duels and hands began to roam.
	Makoto watched with a smile as her roommate took the initiative 
and all but tackled their blonde friend onto her back. She was pretty 
sure no phantom thief had ever been unmasked, not to even speak about 
unclothed, that quickly. A part of her was amazed at the vigor, the 
sheer vitality with which Hotaru pressed her advantage over the older 
girl. Repressed feelings of loneliness and longing were almost 
tangible in the air and she figured now was a good time to quietly 
slip out and leave those two themselves... Except the incredible 
arousing display held her captive for several more moments than 
originally intended. Makoto could feel the heat rising not only in the 
room but also in her own body, starting right between her thighs and 
spreading outward quickly.
	Being caught in the flow of hormones that had captured the room 
in its dominant grasp, she almost jumped when suddenly she herself 
became the momentary focus of her younger friend&#39;s eagerness. A gasp 
quickly turned into a moan when two hands disappeared under her blouse 
before the taller girl even realized what was happening. Makoto was 
incapable of believing that the young-seeming girl was THAT good but 
the exciting tremors, quickly rising to quakes that her body put out 
at the touch of INCREDIBLE skillful fingers working over her bosom 
left her gasping for air when Hotaru finally pulled back to put 
something in her hand.
	It took her several moments to even snap out of the emotional 
shock that Hotaru&#39;s ministrations had brought upon her before Makoto 
realized it was the magical compact in her hand and that Hotaru had 
whispered to her to try it herself before returning her attention to 
the blonde with an almost limitless energy.
	Minako had only been momentary confused about the lack of 
contact before realizing where her attacker had gone. Deciding to play 
a more active role she sat up just in time to catch Hotaru as the girl 
pounced upon her again. Using her superior strength and agility she 
shifted her body in a way that she was able to grasp the dark-haired 
girl. A second later it was Hotaru who found herself gazing up at the 
face of one kitsune-smiling blonde looming over her with an intent 
that was as clear as the sun rising every morning. &quot;I hope you didn&#39;t 
forget that we thieves are supposed to be very elusive. Now,&quot; Minako 
all but purred, &quot;let me relieve you of your most prized possessions.&quot;
	Having made her own experiences already, the blonde woman was 
fully intending to pay the other girl back for the earlier treatment. 
But instead of sheathing her clothes like a lust-crazed animal, Minako 
took her sweet time removing every article of clothing with slow 
precision that left Hotaru wiggling in anxious, torturous need and 
frustration. When the task was finally done, Minako was straddling a 
naked Hotaru and for a long moment - that made the helpless girl 
almost wail in anticipation - studied the delicate, well-proportioned 
curves. Beyond doubt there was nothing left of the sickly, 
genetically-modified young girl that they had first met. Tomoe Hotaru 
had, and that was by far an understatement, a body that every woman 
would be proud of. She wasn&#39;t exactly sporting high class standards, 
but then again Minako never was one for often artificial-enhanced 
attributes like breasts there you were left wondering how exactly 
those woman were even able to walk. While not exactly looking after 
woman per se, Minako appreciated a natural beautiful figure... and 
Hotaru was very natural indeed. Which left the blonde wondering what 
the heck she had been doing chasing after stupid boys who didn&#39;t 
appreciate her anyway when she could have had someone like that...
	&#39;Doesn&#39;t matter now&#39;, Minako decided and to the immense relief 
of her all too willing victim brought her hands to the nicely shaped 
breasts, letting her movements flow more from instinct when 
experience. She was Sailorvenus, Senshi of Love, after all and there 
was a lot she could instinctively draw from her past life.
	Makoto had hung back, recovering from the intense but much too 
brief treatment by the sex kitten currently having her role reversed. 
Who would have thought that Hotaru was that... that... eager! This was 
of course nothing to just leave lying down. The little tease was going 
to get what she deserved and so was Minako for... for tempting her 
with that incredible sexy body! That gave the brunette a brief moment 
of pause, wondering what exactly had happened to helping Hotaru and 
then shrugged. It was her friend&#39;s own fault after all, not that she 
seemed to think of it like that.
	Hotaru was squirming under a barrage of kisses lavished upon her 
lips, neck, throat and finally reaching her by now fully aroused 
breasts. Minako&#39;s movements were slow and savoring but by doing this 
elicited a sheer distracting torture. It definitely had to be the 
alcohol making her act on instinct alone, Hotaru reasoned since she 
wouldn&#39;t have quite believed Minako would come this close to matching 
Peitho&#39;s skill. That thought hardly mattered though when the older 
girl decided to suddenly change pace. The barest brush against her 
core was all the warning Hotaru got before two fingers slipped past 
the veil concealing her most private possession, the transformed 
blonde definitely making good time in keeping her promise of taking it 
away.
	Minako smiled in triumphant glee when Hotaru buried her head in 
the cushion, eyes half-closed and practically glowing with desire. She 
had to use her other hand to steady the younger girl when hips bucked 
in immediate reaction to the wild and fast pace she was applying with 
her fingers. Adding a third finger to brush against the small nub, 
Minako was delighted to hear the unrestrained screech signaling 
success from her victim. Hotaru&#39;s body arched, all those pent up 
frustrations and loneliness coming to the forefront and transforming 
into a mighty eruption that even surprised its initiator. The Senshi 
of Love had barely time to prepare herself before the dark-haired girl 
literally exploded on her fingers, her thighs snapping together in 
unconscious reaction and threatening to crush the instruments of 
pleasure in between them!
	Minako was still recovering from the violent reaction, staring 
at the momentarily limp form beneath her in bewilderment and that was 
when Makoto, who had watched with a steadily increasing libido of her 
own, decided to seize her opportunity. Before Minako could as much as 
react she found her hands grabbed from behind and the cold material of 
something metallic snap around her waists, effectively binding them. 
Thus limited she was pulled back against the taller girl who whispered 
in a voice that was both threatening and seductive. &quot;Harassing 
helpless maidens? I am afraid I have to put you under arrest and give 
you a proper punishment, Kaito-chan.&quot;
	Minako shivered in expectation and Makoto wasn&#39;t one to 
disappoint. Slipping her arms around the blonde&#39;s body she used her 
hands that were adorned with fingerless gloves to cup the full 
breasts, squeezing firmly. The shockwave of pleasure and plain lust 
created by the stronger girl&#39;s dominating action made Minako&#39;s head 
swim and she was barely able to see anything about her attacker&#39;s 
changed state beyond the fact that Makoto seemed even a bit taller and 
stronger than before, her trademark ponytail absent and instead 
reformed into a traditional warrior&#39;s braid. Beyond that the brunette 
was quite literally sporting nothing to really make an accurate 
distinction. To see any difference beyond that would have to involve 
having seen the Martial Artist naked before!
	Hotaru for her part was beyond pleased with the way things had 
developed. Her currently one-track mind had decided after the 
explosive release she had experienced at the hands of her long-desired 
friend that everything was proceeding just as hoped, even more so. 
Rolling to the side and coming to a sitting position next to the other 
two girls the Senshi of Silence had quickly been reenergized at the 
breathtaking sight of her tall - even taller now - roommate reversing 
the roles yet again. Minako was totally helpless and at the other 
girl&#39;s mercy. &quot;What exactly are you supposed to represent?&quot; Hotaru 
asked with an appreciative grin, taking in the firm but lean body with 
supple muscles underneath a battle-hardened armor of skin and flesh. 
Makoto&#39;s arms and legs were a bit thicker too but definitely hadn&#39;t 
lost any of their smoothness. All in all she looked like a somewhat 
regal but all over elegant fighter radiating an aura of dominant 
power.
	&quot;Why, I am a noble samurai of course,&quot; Makoto declared proudly 
and reinforced her statement by pushing her captive forward. &quot;I 
protect the innocent and deal punishment on the criminals.&quot; Without 
giving the other girl who was soon to be reversing the hold on the 
headboard with her chained hands to a death grip any mercy, Makoto&#39;s 
hands moved downwards, one landing on the exposed butt and the other 
finding the valley of the promised land right away, invading sacred 
territory with three fingers at once making Minako keen with the 
sensations that were surely ripping through her from the forceful 
intrusion.
	&quot;A samurai with handcuffs?&quot; Hotaru asked amused.
	&quot;Hey, you said we should do something complex,&quot; Makoto chirped 
in reply just before the caressing on her captive&#39;s behind turned into 
a light smack, followed by a harder one, the fingers playing between 
her thighs stopping a moment before resuming their pistoning motion at 
even greater speed driving Minako mad with pleasure but for some 
reason always holding her on the brink of release.
	For the three girls this had gone far beyond a simple act of fun 
or physical pleasure. It had become a competition. All of them were 
rather competitive girls. Yes, even Hotaru when she had the right 
motivation. And being the subtle initiator here motivation was clearly 
not lacking. However, she intended to win this challenge. Almost as 
expected both of her now lovers had been very creative, trying to 
impress the other two with their manner of role play, testing out the 
new limitations of the compact. Hotaru had ensured that the energy was 
big enough to support at least three different people at once. The old 
compact had required constant reloading and was only suited for Minako 
alone. Those regulations had been easy to modify and were now brought 
to a new level. Neither Minako nor Makoto had, however, realized the 
full powers of her alteration and that was why she was going to be 
victorious in the end. There wasn&#39;t anything to top that one and when 
she was finished the possibility of winning that bet with Makoto would 
also have greatly increased!
	While Hotaru was plotting her move, Makoto had Minako at her 
utter and complete mercy. The tall brunette was towering over and 
behind her helplessly writhing friend, her body pressed against that 
of Minako in a way that brought Makoto&#39;s own groin rubbing in-between 
her lifted butt cheeks, practically creating static electricity that 
only served to fuel the samurai&#39;s motions with new vigor. Having been 
the only one who had been sexual active before that, Minako only 
grunted slightly when she was forced to finally accept Makoto&#39;s entire 
hand in her by now pretty slippery passage. Shifting to compensate for 
the new level of fulfillment a cry split from her lips as an immediate 
chain reaction to Makoto&#39;s own shout of an earthshaking orgasm drowned 
out surprise. The one hand she had fastened around Minako&#39;s breast 
closed to a level of actually numbing pain. But that was easily being 
ignored by the own powerful release that wrecked her system as the 
other hand inside of her struck with an equal force, quickly 
overriding the initial jolt with sheer ecstasy. Minako&#39;s body shook as 
if thousands of volt were pounding through her every cell and given 
who exactly it was that brought her to this manner of release it was 
an analogy not far away from reality.
	There was a reason behind the unexpected - if definitely not 
unwanted - reaction of Minako&#39;s tormentor. Makoto had been planning to 
work out all those repressed feelings for a little longer, enjoying 
the control she had over her blonde friend, a control that the other 
girl for once didn&#39;t even begin to fight, easily submitting to the 
sensations she could invoke upon her body. Her concentration was 
centered directly on the object of her desires and so it was, just as 
she had planned, Hotaru who had the upper hand again. Makoto got the 
momentary ghost of a glance at a vision emerging behind her that her 
lust-crazed and alcohol-induced mind was refusing to believe in before 
the truth was hammered home. Literally.
	Despite what you might think of Kino Makoto, a woman in the full 
bloom of her young years, beyond some tentative self-exploration she 
didn&#39;t have any sexual experience before this night. Oh, she had read 
some novels and all those things teenagers did at some point... but 
experience, no. However, she had always wished it to be different, 
deep in her heart she had always felt unfulfilled. As much as she 
wanted to deny how the loneliness affected her, a part of her remained 
wondering what it would be like to be an experienced woman, someone 
who knew even the most private parts of her body. That was after all 
an aspect of being an adult, right?
	Those deep desires brought to exposure by the alcohol in her 
systems had been transferred into the picture she had used for her 
transformation and - showing once again how major the change in the 
compact was - now she did have all the marks of a &#39;mature&#39; woman. That 
was a good thing because otherwise there surely had been some serious 
pain instead of the slight discomfort and only momentary resistance 
involved when she felt the impossible thick member slipping right into 
her anus, sliding almost all the way home and initiating the 
detonation of a miniature nuclear bomb inside of her from the shock 
and the instant eruption of nerve-blinding fire within her body.
	It took Makoto a long time to even master enough mental strength 
to relay the comment of turning her head and that little bit of 
stubborn control was all but lost as she found the frame of a boy/man 
behind her. It was impossible for her to determine an actual age but 
the shoulder-length black hair and purple eyes and the victorious 
smirk that the fascinatingly male version of Hotaru sent her prey was 
enough to make Makoto stop questioning and just enjoy the powerful 
thrust at a leisure but steadily increasing pace.
	Minako was caught up in all this at the other end. The treatment 
Makoto received right now was reflecting right over to her, every 
thrust from the handsome girl-turned-boy egging the brunette further 
onward in her own pace applied to the still chained woman. The chain 
reaction brought upon by this was so intense that Minako didn&#39;t even 
have the presence of mind to wonder what exactly had overcome the girl 
behind her, the blonde&#39;s own body being ridden like a wild mustang, a 
crescendo of a new height she had previously thought impossible - even 
between the high stamina and vigor of three Senshi - building and 
building with no end in sight.
	This activity went on for several minutes, the daisy chain 
unintentionally constructed by the three girls - well, okay two girls 
and one boy now - amplifying the pleasure dealt by one and channeling 
it further into the chain like a spiral where one action traveled 
through all participants to eventually end back by the initiator, 
namely Hotaru, who felt all the explosions from the girls in front of 
her... err, him, as if they were his own. Had he been in clear 
possession of his wits, he probably would have been shocked by his own 
actions and boldness but since this wasn&#39;t an issue anymore for a long 
time, the thought didn&#39;t even cross his mind. Sensing that both girls 
were pretty much mindless with ecstasy and at the edge of what they 
and the magical transformations could take, Hotaru decided it was time 
to stop playing around. To tell the absolute truth he was amazed 
himself how incredibly well the gender switch had worked. There had 
been some residential doubts if that might strain the limitations of 
the enhanced compact. This body was everything and much more than he 
had hoped for and would serve as the perfect means to achieve his 
ultimate goal. Once again, a normal thinking Hotaru would have shied 
away from the direct violation the thought contained but even the cool 
presence of Saturn was caught up in the erotic dance of pleasure. 
Phoebe had waited so long every shield and barrier that would have 
stood firm in the face of almost every frightening, dark entity had 
crumbled already. She wanted this. Oh, and how she wanted this! But 
first...
	Makoto had been on the edge of her limit. She had felt Jupiter&#39;s 
strong presence only inches away from taking over and when Hotaru 
behind her shifted in the middle of the thrusting motion. The cock, 
that - as much as the fragments of Makoto&#39;s blissfully absent mind 
were able to comprehend - every normal member of the male species 
wouldn&#39;t be able to resist being envious of, was redirected and found 
its way smoothly inside of her already lubricated center, previously 
attended by one of Hotaru&#39;s hands that now joined the other in 
fondling the tall girl&#39;s breasts.
	Makoto let loose with a reverberating cry of release as the 
fires in her body all came fusing together like one big flame that 
filled every cell, every little inch of her innermost self before 
exploding into a white-hot haze. The sign of Jupiter flashed on her 
forehead in emerald green but somehow the transformation managed to 
stay in place just long enough until the nerve-wrecking orgasm 
completely rippled over her and Hotaru had gently laid her on her back 
next to the panting form of Minako who had given up all insistence of 
keeping her form, Venus having long since taken over. 
	&#39;How incredible convenient&#39;, Hotaru thought with a triumphant 
smile.

******************************

	Minako/Venus wasn&#39;t sure whether to be crying, laughing, cursing 
or praying. Makoto had definitely just topped any sex she had had in 
her young life, taking her on a wild ride that was nearing the scale 
of impossibility and now coming down a little from her height - but 
still horny as hell! - she had to wonder what had brought on that 
relentless attack since it ceased to feel calculated and planned out 
at the point when Makoto herself had began to channel her own pleasure 
into her. No doubt by the third player in their merry little... well, 
whatever they were right now. Just how the younger girl had been able 
to do bring about such a strong reaction was beyond her. &#39;It was 
almost as if she was being ridden by a man&#39;, Venus mused, just before 
glancing up and finding her train of humorous thoughts coming to a 
tumbling halt at the sight that greeted her.
	The blonde Senshi had turned around after being released from 
Makoto&#39;s ministration, the handcuffs had been snapped somewhere in the 
process of the last release from her attacker that she had felt VERY 
clearly. Now physically unrestrained she still was beyond captivated 
as her gaze fell upon the body hovering just above her that put all 
her previous lovers to shame. Blue eyes traveled down the length of a 
muscular frame, not too bulging or reminding someone of a bodybuilder 
but with a similar natural grace and beauty she had admired before in 
Hotaru. Her eyes nearly threatened to bug out and tumble to the floor 
at the sheer SIZE of the unquestionable hunk&#39;s equipment... just 
before they swiveled upwards again to reassure herself that she hadn&#39;t 
hallucinated the features that while definitely more handsome still 
held the same vibrancy, deep purple eyes and the mane of dark hair.
	&quot;Ho-Hotaru...&quot; she stammered out.
	The boy&#39;s... no, wait that was an insult. There was nothing 
boyish about that guy, she chastened herself. The MAN&#39;s lips quirked 
in a cocky smile. &quot;What about it, Minako-chan? Care to have a taste?&quot;
	&#39;Kami&#39;, Venus breathed mentally at the implied double innuendo 
and could not help but bringing trembling hands up to assure herself 
of how very real the MAN in front of her was. Just like the other two 
participants in their action, Venus had lost any sort of control long 
ago and patience had followed shortly. And so, reenergized by the 
godly sight in front of her eyes, lust drove her body onwards as hands 
came up to only briefly explore the hard chest and upper body of 
Hotaru&#39;s male version before they literally flew downward, grasping at 
the enormous shaft in between his legs, surprising Hotaru at the fast 
recovery and eagerness with which the blonde woman acted. He had been 
on the brink of release before bringing Makoto off for the final time 
and now his body went rigid like a bowstring and for a moment it was 
once again role reversal as Venus&#39;s mouth latched onto his member and 
SUCKED.
	&quot;Oh shit!&quot; he gasped, exploding inside the woman&#39;s mouth which 
seemed all too eager to consume it all. One definite advantage though 
was that this body definitely had a much higher stamina than a normal 
man&#39;s would have under those circumstances. Venus was fast to learn 
that. She had released the massive cock after lapping up pretty much 
everything Hotaru seemingly had to bother, amazed that it was still 
standing quite erect!
	Before she could contemplate resuming her task she was pulled up 
by strong hands and against the muscular frame of her lover. Blue met 
purple in a mutual expression of lust and need and then their mouths 
crashed together. Venus probed forward with her tongue and Hotaru met 
her in an incredible hot dance of passion. Their hands were wandering 
all over the other&#39;s body. All thought about foreplay was thrown out 
of the window and Venus, being the Senshi of Love after all, moved 
with instinct, heaving her body up a little to meet Hotaru&#39;s thrust 
that impaled her right through her very core.
	The blonde Senshi sighed in rapture as she felt herself being 
filled completely by that enormous phallus before the fulfilling 
noises turned into a quiet cries and soon into shrieks of ecstasy as 
Hotaru applied a fast pace of thrusts while their lips meshed and 
hands played over their joined bodies bringing each of them to new 
levels of joined harmony.

******************************

	Almost forgotten, Jupiter had recovered meanwhile - now with the 
full disposal of her Senshi strength and stamina at her disposal that 
even a magical transformation couldn&#39;t copy. The Senshi of Protection 
was many things but she surely was not one to quietly sit back and 
watch the action even when or maybe because it was so incredible 
erotic. Hotaru-kun and Minako/Venus made such a striking contrast and 
a very fitting and completing one at that. It was like watching two 
halves of something bigger come together. Dragged into this far enough 
already though, Jupiter wasn&#39;t going to settle for being neglected.
	Making her way on the bed behind the couple locked in the thrall 
of passion, the brown-haired Senshi made her presence known by 
beginning to kiss the smooth back of her leader, licking and covering 
every square inch with her tongue and lips. Venus&#39; moans increased at 
the added stimulation, the humping pace of Hotaru-kun already more 
than enough to send her mind - in case it was still present - into the 
spheres of delirium. She could barely believe the stamina of the man 
in front of her and if there had been any doubt before, now she knew 
for sure that something so... MAGNIFICENT could only be achieved 
through magic. Not that Venus cared one little bit right now!
	Hotaru and Jupiter&#39;s hands briefly met on the swell of Venus&#39; 
breasts. The blonde Senshi was now squeezed in between her teammates 
like the inner layer of a sandwich. Jupiter was resting in a sitting 
position against the headboard and had pulled Venus back so that her 
back was pressing against her own chest and her butt was grinded in 
Jupiter&#39;s nether regions, stimulating the strong Senshi in her own way 
with every thrust that could be felt rocking through her from Hotaru&#39;s 
end. In unconscious communication control over Venus&#39; ample bosoms was 
switched and Hotaru brought her hands down to alternate lift and 
caress the blonde&#39;s behind and slipping a couple of fingers in between 
the folds of Jupiter&#39;s core, synchronizing the rhythm with his 
unrelenting pace.
	Entwined like this it was actually hard to distinguish where one 
of them began and where the other two ended. Just like before the 
close proximity and shared contact was creating a spiral of passion 
that sprang from one to the other to the next and back to the 
beginning, increasing steadily in intensity. Hotaru knew he was 
reaching his limits of physical and spiritual control. The next climax 
would exhaust what little magic was left of the transformation. But he 
wasn&#39;t done yet, this was going to take careful precision and the time 
for the finishing touch had almost come.
	Nearing a new height of desire, Hotaru once more picked up his 
speed, drawing out almost strangled gasps and grunts from Venus, while 
not letting up on the activities of his hands further below as well. 
He was already implying a good deal of Senshi speed to keep up with 
his own tempo and once this one was over he&#39;d probably have to relent 
full control to Saturn anyway.
	The action was almost to difficult to perform in his current 
state but some detached part of his mind who had clung to the task as 
a quasi replacement for control was relaying him just the right moment 
to act. The plan had actually morphed quite a bit upon including 
Makoto. Yet, while Hotaru would have liked nothing more than to claim 
the blonde Senshi for herself, there was a great deal of affection and 
respect for his roommate, not to mention a compassion born from twenty 
millennia of loneliness. A compassion strong enough that he was more 
than willing, in his hardly rational state of mind, to accept the 
slightly more difficult adjustment.
	Everything came together at once. Hotaru pulled back for a final 
thrust, coiling one hand inside of Jupiter while cupping one of Venus&#39; 
cheeks so that she wouldn&#39;t get squished in the process, and then 
rocked forward, pressing onward with his member and hand at the same 
time. Had the manor not been pretty isolated and had there been any 
maintenance stuff or guests left they probably would have wondered 
about the murderous scream of its mistress. Jupiter surely would have 
followed suit had she not been currently engaged in a hungry kiss when 
the triple climax hit them all, sending a raging inferno of sexual and 
magical energy that had charged the air around them, enveloping all 
three in something that for a moment felt otherworldly, like an 
ancient presence touching them all. It was intense, feeling almost as 
if they were being tested by something. Jupiter bit down on Hotaru&#39;s 
lower lip in catalyzing ecstasy. And then the moment passed and the 
concentration of highly potent energy washed over them like a raging 
tsunami, sending all three participants into a now truly mindless 
frenzy to ride out the sensation as long as somehow possible.
	Hotaru didn&#39;t even break stride as the transformation of her 
male counterpart was washed away and she was filled with new stamina 
from Saturn. One hand quickly resumed the work of the now missing 
member and both Venus and Jupiter barely noticed the change until very 
later upon which point they wouldn&#39;t have anything to complain about.
	Now, it was truly Senshi mating. Pure, magnificent and 
powerful... and with longer reaching consequences as anyone would 
realize or remember for several months.

******************************

	Outside the manor the man turned away with a satisfied smile on 
his face. The plan had been accomplished wonderfully, even more 
successful than he had dared to hope for. Oh, there would be some 
negative reactions at first, a lot of angst, drama and whatnot that 
humans indulged in whenever they found themselves unable to cope with 
a situation far beyond their control but the eventual results would be 
a potent union that would in turn be a great asset in the upcoming 
struggle.
	The man didn&#39;t turn as in a flash of golden light a taller 
blonde woman in traditional miko robes appeared at his side. &quot;What did 
you do now? You know we are not supposed to interfere with them...&quot;
	&quot;But I wasn&#39;t interfering, Filia-chan,&quot; the man replied with an 
expression of so much innocence that it was already unbelievable for 
even the most gullible fool. &quot;I was merely making sure that they would 
loosen up a little, you know discard some of those foolish human 
limitations like prudence and inhabitations. I&#39;m sure they will be so 
much more happier in the long run.&quot;
	The dragon in human form called Filia looked at the man with 
unrestrained skepticism, unable to get the thought through her mind 
that any action of him would actually make someone HAPPY. &quot;WHAT did 
you do?&quot; she asked again, this time with a slight warning growl, 
already harboring some dark suspicion about her (unwillingly) long 
time companion&#39;s presence here.
	She should have known better, she should have really known 
better than to ask that question. However, it was almost as if the man 
provoked these questions just for this one single purpose and Filia 
found herself slashing at thin air, her trusted spiked club impacting 
with the pavement and leaving a fairly-sized hole as a reminder when 
the man assumed the proper pose with one finger raised in a 
mysterious, mocking gesture. &quot;Now that... is a secret.&quot; And with that 
he was gone before Filia could vent her frustration, leaving her to 
exclaim in a rage only possible for a dragon to the heaven&#39;s the 
accursed name of one - self-proclaimed - mysterious (and annoyingly 
meddling) priest.
	&quot;XELLOSS!!!&quot;
