<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Freudian Slip<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Something had drawn the miko to their meeting place an hour early.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Situated  in the building’s public sound booth; a room on the first floor that  boasted large, glass windows so that her fans and the media could see  and hear her from the street outside, Minako was still in the midst of  her radio interview.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Anxious eyes scanned the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was  nothing out of the ordinary. A calculated sweep of those gathered told  Rei there were about a hundred in attendance, to include the media. For  the most part, the fans were well behaved, if overly excited; some  touting large signs, others wearing tour t-shirts, and many carrying  those damnable plush unicorn mascots, Nako-Nako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So why was she so on edge?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Something… something’s wrong here.’</em> She couldn’t smell it, she couldn’t see it, but she could sense it. And  while she didn’t feel an overwhelming sense of danger, Rei knew her  presence would be needed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko threaded her way through the  fans, always keeping her dark eyes trained on the singer. She smacked  her lips when a large, smelly otaku of a man stepped in front of her,  clutching a handful of glossy photos of the idol. He made her hackles  rise in and of himself, but he wasn’t the reason for her uneasiness,  and so she reluctantly moved on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei slowed a moment, and  allowing the crowd to absorb her, she joined them, just one more  gawking fan as she admired Minako’s exuberant hand gestures and wide  smile. She’d have lied if she’d claimed to have heard what the singer  was talking about, for she was a little too preoccupied with the black  leather mini skirt and tight white top she wore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she must  have stared too long, for, as if feeling her stare out of all the  others, when Minako turned to her fans, she looked right in Rei’s  direction.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei tore her eyes from the singer’s body, ducked  behind a rather tall woman, and moved on. She’d come early based on the  niggling sense of wrongness that had tickled her senses, and with a  small smirk, she reasoned she could oogle Minako later. Until then,  she’d make damn sure that whatever had triggered her extra sensory  radar wasn’t something that would involve her girlfriend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Best friend!’</em> She corrected herself hurriedly, even as her suspicious gaze caught  sight of a small group of fans heading around the back of the building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With a disapproving growl, Rei pushed her Freudian slip to the back of her mind and gave chase.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  door to the sound booth shut behind the singer with a click, and with a  sigh, she leaned back against it tiredly. The exhausted expression on  her face slipped into the slightest of smiles as she checked her watch,  and one hopeful thought was enough to lift her spirits, <em>‘Rei will be here soon.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  pushed her petite frame away from the door and headed down the corridor  towards her private office when several overly animated voices put her  senses on alarm,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It was a terrible thing  when her own name could make her inwardly cringe, but the sudden  intrusion of perhaps two dozen unauthorized fans was not only  unexpected, but was also frankly unwanted at the moment. They charged  in her direction and the group of people became a solid mass of arms,  markers, magazines and signature boards being thrust towards her  expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A girlish squeak rose above the rest, and though it  sounded like just another fan’s, Minako felt some amount of relief that  her manager, who had exited the sound booth into the midst of the  screaming teens, was trying to help her. Standing awkwardly before them  as a chipping dam that could halt the flow of her fans only for so  long, Saitou Sugao held his ground.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Though her privacy had been  infringed on, Minako still felt guilty about giving her fans the slip.  Nevertheless, with a wink and a plastic smile, she flashed them the  victory sign, twirled elegantly, and headed back towards her office,  trying her best to keep the sense of urgency out of her step as she  hurriedly twisted and turned down several corridors.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But when  that white wooden door boasting her name written largely on a golden  plaque loomed in her vision at the end of the hallway, the singer’s  spirits fell. <em>‘Some hiding place that’ll be.’</em> She realized belatedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  that was when a strong pair of arms wrapped around her waist and the  gravity of its owner’s motion pulled her back into the darkness of the  underside of a mostly enclosed stairwell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Between the adrenaline  she’d felt at being stalked by the intruders, and the sudden capture of  her body, the singer panicked. But as if her captor had anticipated the  tensing of her body, a warm hand clasped itself over her lips and the  arm around her waist pulled her frame closer to the soft body behind  her, even as their two forms sunk to the floor at the back of the  stairwell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shhh.” The calm, quiet voice in her ear was the only  thing that broke through her frazzled senses, and immediately, Minako’s  body relaxed into the backwards embrace of her best friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  not a moment too soon, for it was at that moment that the gaggle of  fans came stampeding down the corridor. Shouting recklessly, bouncing  off the walls and each other, clutching glossy prints and stuffed  mascots, they neared the stairwell where the two women hid.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  found herself holding her breath, though she wasn’t entirely sure  whether it was because of her pursuers’ nearness or the protective  embrace she found herself in; Rei’s arm wrapped tightly around her  waist, one hand still loosely held over her mouth, the miko’s long,  dark hair tickling the singer’s face, and the warm breath puffing  lightly in her ear. Minako shut her caramel eyes, tipped her head into  Rei’s, and although she lacked the miko’s psychic abilities, she  allowed herself to believe that the emotions she sensed from her best  friend were as strong as those she emanated herself.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And as  quickly as the uninvited fans had crashed into their lives, they were  ushered out of it; even as they passed by their hiding place, a trio of  large security guards intercepted the intruders at a junction in the  corridor, rounded them up, and escorted them out.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the sudden  quiet after the storm, neither woman moved. The miko was unwilling to  let the singer go. Sitting on the floor in between Rei’s legs, Minako  sighed as the miko’s hand finally left her lips. In the dimly lit space  beneath the stairwell, she could feel the miko’s tension mounting.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  sensed…” Rei’s quiet voice hesitated and Minako could feel her shake  her head. The empathic woman obviously didn’t want to delve into how  she had known she’d be needed, and frankly, the singer couldn’t care  less. All that mattered was that Rei was there.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I saw them sneak in, so I-” Rei tried again, but Minako was quick to hush her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Turning  her torso and her head backwards, just enough to catch Rei’s chocolate  eyes in the dim light, Minako whispered, “Thanks for saving me.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  eyes searched one another for the briefest of moments, and given Rei’s  torn expression, Minako found herself wondering what the unpredictable  miko would do.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not trusting herself to say the right words, to  say anything at all, afraid to take the initiative, but finding that  she couldn’t stop herself anyway, Rei tightened her grip around  Minako’s waist, and shutting her eyes, she shyly found the singer’s  lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that was all Minako needed. Rei’s eagerness and  initiative was fuel on the ever burning fire she felt for her best  friend, and their kiss that started innocently enough didn’t remain  innocent for long. It was her hungry tongue that lapped at the corner  of the miko’s mouth, her small teeth that nibbled at Rei’s lower lip,  and before long, the raven haired woman had become as bold and  passionate as she was.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s breath was hot in Minako’s ear as  her lips wandered; dancing along the singer’s jaw line, only to trail  slow, lingering kisses along the soft skin of Minako’s neck. When the  singer’s breath caught in her throat and she tipped her head back,  granting Rei unrestricted access to her sensitive skin, her action only  spurred the other woman on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei found Minako’s response to her  touch only served to ignite her passion more. Every caught breath,  every soft moan, every inch of skin Minako granted her access to, only  left her wanting more. With her eyes shut, her other senses were  intensified, and when Minako’s fingers reached backwards towards her  shoulders, trailing lightly along the collar of her shirt before  clawing her nails gently against the nape of her neck, Rei caught  herself sucking the skin along Minako’s collarbone a little harder than  she’d intended.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But the slight mark she’d left didn’t seem to  bother the singer at all, in fact, it seemed to have quite the opposite  effect. With a content smirk, Minako’s fingers stopped kneading Rei’s  neck and she slowly trailed her nails behind the other woman’s ear. She  traced along the miko’s jaw line as her thumb caressed the corner of  her mouth before she roughly claimed Rei’s lips once again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">At  the complete mercy of Minako’s lips, Rei remembered that she had hands,  and though she was distracted as her best friend’s tongue slipped past  her defenses, she loosened her grip around Minako’s waist. Allowing her  hands to wander, Rei learned the contours of the other woman’s flat  stomach, and when she’d decided that she could no longer tolerate the  slightly scratchy material of the thin sweater that separated her skin  from Minako’s, her fingers slipped underneath that scant piece of  material and-</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Cold!” Minako half gasped, half giggled into Rei’s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But her voice had served as a beacon.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Just  then, the dim light that reached the underside of the staircase was  blocked, but the familiar voice that had heralded a petite, yet manly  figure, indistinguishable in the low light, was obvious enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shacho!” Minako squeaked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Too  much shuffling and rearranging was heard as the two women broke away  from each other and tried to stand, and while Minako had leapt forward  and pulled her sweater a little higher on her collarbone, Rei hadn’t  been so lucky.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A hollow ‘<em>bong’</em> shook the metal frame of  the stairs above them and was followed by a swallowed curse as Rei  knelt back down, cradling her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei!” Minako’s squeak was redirected back to her best friend as she knelt down next to her to try to get a better look.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What  are you two doing under here?” Saitou bowed his head to fit his  diminutive frame under the stairs, but couldn’t make out much in the  dim light other than his client wearing a guilty expression, and her  best friend, who was glaring daggers at him. And though the latter  wasn’t too far from normal for the moody miko, he was put on edge  anyway.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Trying to gauge how much, if anything, her manager had  seen, Minako stumbled, “well… the fans… stampeding… we tried to get  away…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We were hiding from the fans that broke in.” Rei barked,  the aggravation in her voice not going unnoticed. The unexpected  interruption of Minako’s manager had been more alarming than hitting  her head had been and she waved Minako away, even as she kept one hand  firmly on the small of the singer’s back and guided them out from  underneath the stairwell.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the awkward space that hung between the three individuals, Rei finally snorted, “don’t we have work to do?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Work?” Minako asked. Finally, she remembered that the reason for their meeting <em>hadn’t</em> been to make out under the stairs. “Work! Yes,” an electric grin lit  Minako’s face and with her hands on Rei’s shoulders, she turned her  friend around and marched behind her, “we’ll be looking at some of the  charity program documentation together this afternoon, so please, no  disruptions.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei and Minako marched past the suspicious man, the  former with her persistent scowl and lack of eye contact while the  latter called over her shoulder with an authoritative nod, “later,  shacho!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There’d been a moment after the two women had  entered Minako’s office, after the door had shut behind them, after  they’d both let out long held sighs that devolved into a fit of  giggles, that they’d stood there in absolute silence, lost in each  other’s gaze. And in that moment, standing a hair’s breadth away from  each other, they had to make that tough decision that all new couples  face over and over during the infancy of a developing relationship; <em>do we make out or do we get to work and act serious? </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Luckily,  or unluckily, which ever it was would never really be discussed, a  strong work ethic was something that both Hino Rei and Aino Minako  shared.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, with no small amount of effort, the two women  set themselves up on either side of the singer’s desk and had gotten to  work.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Several boxes of half eaten take out Chinese food  lay at the corners of the desk. Papers, folders, and binders were  sprawled in scattered, precarious piles that covered most of the room’s  flat surfaces. A white pen poked from underneath Rei’s raven hair where  it was perched behind her ear, and the end of another was lightly  pressed between her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Always studious and quick to learn, and  considering her own background in and love for public works, Rei had  learned the ins and outs of Minako’s charity rather quickly. She had  offered ideas simple in their origin but grand in their impact. The  miko’s thoughts had bounced off the singer’s, and together, they had  come up with new strategies for fund raising, public involvement,  patient care, and several other exciting projects that could get off  the ground given the staff to work on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei had been quick to  point out that the fledgling charity didn’t even have a name, and  although Minako had been donating considerable amounts of money to the  research of brain cancer, and the welfare of patients affected by the  disease, the miko knew her cause would be furthered if she went public  with a full scale foundation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Now all we need is for someone to  run this thing.” Minako sighed. The charity division had always been a  side project, managed by herself in her spare time, and otherwise  handled only by her accountants who directed the funds.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shouldn’t  be too hard to find some corporate snob with a background in public  works. It wouldn’t be a hard job, it just needs to be done by someone  who cares.” Rei said casually.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The click-clack of Minako’s typing  suddenly paused, and slowly, she looked across her laptop at her best  friend, who was completely unaware of her stare. But when the  fluorescent lights in the hallway outside of the singer’s office  flashed and then dimmed to their lower nighttime setting with a high  pitched electric buzz, Rei finally looked up from her paperwork,  blinking groggily.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She looked at her watch and frowned, “It’s almost midnight. What is it with you and staying up so late?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  let the moment slip away. Leaning back in her swiveling chair, she  pointed to the other woman accusatorily. “Afraid you’ll turn into a  pumpkin?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Keh. I’m not tired,” Rei was quick to defend herself as her pen jotted a few more notes, “I’m just getting started.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well  if that’s the case, I have some more documentation we can look at back  at my apartment…” Minako offered brightly, a not so innocent smirk  gracing her delicate features.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s pen stopped in mid stroke. She raised one, lone eyebrow. “A likely story.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Hey, <em>you’re</em> the one who jumped me under the stairs earlier.” Minako said with a shrug.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s brows met in a challenge. “You’re <em>so</em> going home alone.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer pushed the only mockingly unwilling miko into her apartment and  flipped the hall lights on. Shoes tumbled off their feet tiredly,  scattered haphazardly in the foyer. Minako’s oversized black purse slid  down her arm and was tossed to the hallway floor. She examined her  friend as Rei threw her coat over a chair in the living room and began  to rub the base of her neck. Granted, one in the morning was a  difficult time to be awake, but the stiffness in the miko’s posture  seemed to be indicative of more than just exhaustion.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s first  thought was to pull away from the sudden touch. Her second thought was  that she hadn’t even sensed Minako’s approach from behind. But then,  she stopped thinking completely and surrendered to Minako’s touch as  slender fingers kneaded the stiff muscles at the base of her neck. Her  head lolled forward, her shoulders relaxed, and she allowed that warmth  of the aura that was so distinctly Minako to envelop her – the warmth  that had been strong enough to quell the fear of Sailor Mars.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  slightest crease in Rei’s brow marred her lax expression. The Sailor  Mars of her vision had been silent in the few days she’d found herself  growing closer to Minako, and this had been after she had made some  progress in uncovering more of the memory that the warrior of old had  guarded. But the little glimpse into her past that she’d been granted  hadn’t been enough to quench her curiosity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei’s brow fell flat  once more and she filed this thought away. For the time being, she was  with Minako, and that was the only place she wanted to be.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ah!” Rei’s dark eyes shot open as Minako’s fingers dug into a knot at the base of her neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Geeze, you really <em>are</em> tense.” The singer chided as she worked the knot despite the miko’s fussing.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  smirked but then titled her head thoughtfully. “No, it’s just… I guess  I’m more tired than I thought I was. The charity division is one thing,  I enjoyed working on that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But?” Minako prodded, knowing her friend had more to say but was not one to elaborate on her own.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  guess I don’t understand how you deal with the atmosphere you work in.  I mean, the fans alone put me on edge. I know you must be used to it by  now, but still…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The smile she’d worn all day in Rei’s presence  slipped and the singer sighed. For the briefest of moments, her busy  fingers slowed their quest to relieve the tension in the miko’s neck.  “Well, today <em>was</em> a bit out of the ordinary, but I still can’t  say I’m entirely used to it.” And then the smile was back and her  fingers went back to work. “But hey, it <em>was</em> a good day, I mean, we really kicked some ass brainstorming ideas for the charity.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Un.”  Rei’s response was half sigh, half approval. They really had worked  well together. It had been a far cry from her days when she’d been  stuffed into that deplorable Nako-Nako costume, a frightened girl  seeking to protect a dying friend.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer sucked in an  excited breath, “I know. We should go in on this together! You know,  quit our day jobs and just work on the charity together. What do you  say, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko snorted. “I think that’s just stress getting to you after today’s craziness with the fans.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer’s lower lip turned down in a pout and she wished Rei had been  facing her to catch it. Even the steadfast miko couldn’t resist  Minako’s pout. “Fine then. Let’s not make this about work. Let’s just  run away together. Leave everything behind. We could go anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei offered a quiet chuckle. “Now that’s just exhaustion talking.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It <em>would</em> be nice though.” Minako sighed dramatically.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei couldn’t keep herself from at least imagining the possibility, and the slightest of blushes tinted her cheeks.”It would.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  comfortable silence descended, each woman lost to their own thoughts as  Minako found another knot and gently began to work it. When the only  response granted to her from the miko was a low sigh and the slow but  definite relaxing of the muscles under her fingers, the singer smiled  her victory. Nubile thumbs worked the base of Rei’s neck while  wandering fingers danced towards her collarbone. Before long, the light  brush of Minako’s fingernails and a few well placed light kisses to  Rei’s neck had the miko moaning for an entirely different reason, and  in an instant, the fire they had started under the stairs earlier that  day had been rekindled.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But suddenly, the singer paused, her lips  hovering on the edge of the miko’s ear, her words a quiet whisper. “I’m  not coming on too strong, am I?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei caught her breath. For a  moment, she couldn’t decide whether or not Minako was teasing her for  having been so forward under the stairwell, but hearing the sudden  uncertainty in her best friend’s voice was unsettling. But it was then  that she remembered Minako’s honest words, said in this very room of  her apartment, only a few nights prior;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>I’m not suggesting anything other than that you take your time and figure out what you want, Hino Rei.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  chill ran down the miko’s spine, and she knew Minako, with her chest  pressed so tightly to her back could feel it, too. That Minako was  being so cautious of her feelings and the state of their budding  relationship meant the world to Rei.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But she still didn’t know  how to respond. How could she ease Minako’s worries? How could she  articulate the wealth of emotions she felt without tripping over her  own tongue? How could she say words she knew Minako wanted to hear when  she was still afraid of their meaning?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Slowly, Rei turned in  Minako’s light embrace, and in those caramel eyes, the miko could see  the same overflowing desire she, herself felt. And though she knew she  wanted the very same thing that Rei wanted, the other woman placed one,  trembling finger over the singer’s lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She wanted to save it.  At least for a little while. But in the meantime, that didn’t mean she  didn’t want to be as close as physically possible to Minako. Right?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You know what would be the perfect ending to a day like today?” Rei hazarded.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako forced her racing heart to slow. “Hmm?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just… falling asleep next to you. I didn’t exactly get to… enjoy it the last time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko’s words were halting and awkward, and to this, the singer smiled,  cherishing the rosy glow on the taller woman’s cheeks. Though she knew  that the fire couldn’t and wouldn’t be extinguished completely, she  agreed that she couldn’t think of a more perfect way to end the day.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, Minako smiled warmly, and taking Rei’s hand in her own, she led her to her bedroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Ha!  Pulled the punch. Sorry. Oh, who am I kidding? No I’m not. I’m trying  to keep poor Rei in character, after all. Okay, so, this chapter was a  little more fluff, but you’ll see the reason for it. And I’m sure most  of you aren’t going to complain about fluff anyway!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 11:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You should know that best.” The raven haired warrior sneered, “after all, it was <em>you</em> who locked your memories away, leaving yourself to guard it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Me? Why would I do such a thing?&quot;</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“To  protect your reincarnated self; the memories of your relationship with  Venus and its disastrous end were hidden away,” Mars’ tone was  righteous, but then her dark eyes narrowed, “that is, until you  tampered with the lock.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko was unfazed by her counterpart’s venom. “And I’ve regained them all except for this one. I must know why.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Would you really pry open something so tightly locked, Princess of Mars?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">For  the first time, Rei faltered. “I… I need this memory to be complete. I  have to know how this one memory relates to my current self.”</span></p>
