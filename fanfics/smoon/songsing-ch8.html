<p><em>My name…</em></p>
<p><em>Drowned…</em></p>
<p><em>On her tongue…</em></p>
<p><em>--</em></p>
<p><em>a u t h o r u n k n o w n</em></p>
<p><em>--</em></p>
<p><u>“<em>Mouth: Omega – viii.”</em></u></p>
<p>Her  legs near buckled from the sprinting she had done from the cab to this  park – it was far more fever pitched than on the playing field. This  time it was for a cause. <em>Her</em> cause. But damned the rehearsals  for getting in her way, they ran for far longer than she had counted  on. Thankfully, Zoicite agreed to play the part of the needed  smokescreen for her. Otherwise, Terry’s vise-like grip on her life  would have ruined this moment… Minako spared a glance to the timepiece  loosely hugging at her wrist. It was jostled about violently, but she  still managed to make out the time.</p>
<p><em>Shit!</em></p>
<p>There was no denying it now. Minako. Was. Late. Two and a half <em>hours</em> late. The afternoon crowd had somewhat thinned as she drew herself to  where the meeting point was to be. Dark haired women were a dime a  dozen in her native country. Yet none of them…were <em>her</em>. Even  behind her rose tinted glasses, Minako could tell her apart from any  other. As she scanned the area flashes of her stance, her laugh, her  smile and the way those once cherubic cheeks grew rosy with  embarrassment or anger, frolicked with abandon in her mind.</p>
<p><em>When did she begin seeing Rei as more that just a friend? </em>Minako couldn’t answer her own question.</p>
<p>Deep  heaving breaths did very little to control the pulsing pain in her  temples. There was no plausible way that Minako SHOULD have been  standing upright. The flurry of colors and incessant cries of children  in the park distracted her from her quest. Left and right did her eyes  roam. <em>Nothing.</em> Absently, she hadn’t realized that her left hand  began clutching at her chest. Panic set in. But Rei wasn’t the type to  balk on a promise. Minako had hoped that that part of the miko was  still tried and true.</p>
<p>So with a few shaky steps, the Star sallied  forth – Sure enough though, a few people garnered double takes on her.  People would begin to recognize the Singer. But with practiced  precision, Minako averted their curious glances, tucked into her  windbreaker and briskly walked away. No one would get in her way, not  today. As her eyes continued to sweep before her, Minako all but paused  in her trek.</p>
<p>There she was. Not even a few paces from her.</p>
<p>Rei  was crouched awkwardly before a little girl, who had bawled herself  into a fit of hiccoughs. Her sprained leg was semi outstretched and  bound in a bulky contraption, but it hadn’t taken away from Rei’s  allure. Her love of children had always been a predominant personality  trait for the one-time priestess. Minako unwittingly edged herself  behind a massive trunk of the nearest tree to her; there…she watched  her friend tenderly coddle the seemingly lost child.</p>
<p>As the  little girl wiped her eyes, the miko began to lift herself, she  afforded a gentle pat on the young one’s head before taking the little  girl’s hand in her own. Rei didn’t have to hobble for very long as the  child’s parents quickly gravitated towards them. A fitful flurry of  thank yous and relieved prose came to an end as the raven-haired senshi  waved the hiccoughing youth off. At least it took her mind off her  current situation. Being uncomfy that it would be only she and the  Star. If, that is, the woman had decency enough to show. Rubbing her  arms through her loose sweater top in vain, Rei glanced at herself  again. Form fitting jeans didn’t go well when one side had been cut  short to accommodate the leg brace she now wore, she was a walking  fashion faux pax. She shouldn’t have cared, but she did.</p>
<p>“It’s ONLY Minako” <em>Minako who’s a global Icon</em>, whined her mind, even as her mouth muttered aloud, “…Minako who’s also…” a pause was given to check the time, “<em>Not</em> here…and why I <em>am,</em> is beyond me.” With a grunt, the woman readied to leave the park – She  wasn’t about to play the part of a hopeless woebegone, being stood up  for. Nor being the laughingstock to Terry Lapps’ jibes. Rei could hear  the gruff accented brogue mocking her in her thoughts.</p>
<p>“<em>Puh-lease…y’think Minako woulda been there? Woman’s busy, like she’d have time for a person that never made time for her?”</em></p>
<p>Her fists clenched in utter frustration. She’d have to give Usagi a call at her <em>‘working place’</em> to garner a ride. But even before she took a step, Rei was draped  within an encompassing warmth. She knew this radiating warmth as she  knew her own heartbeat. If it was possible…Rei felt her even before she  knew she was being watched.</p>
<p>“Don’t leave.”</p>
<p>Rei’s body  became uncooperative. She swallowed nervously to wet her suddenly dry  throat. She impressed herself though, as she thought she delivered a  snide remark, “Two hours…I could have been watching water <em>boil</em> in a pot, Minako.”</p>
<p>It  wasn’t a laugh, nor was it a scoff, but a breath escaped from the  Singer’s lips. A soft plea that was soon followed with her dulcet voice.</p>
<p>“Rei.”, she paused savoring that name for just a moment.</p>
<p>Minako’s  mind ran amok searching for words that wouldn’t frighten the miko off  soon after. “I’m asking you to stay…” She couldn’t stop them from  rolling from her tongue. Minako didn’t want to. She was heated, flushed  with a shy rapture uttering such simple words. She quickly added on,  “…We’re supposed to be having fun today, ne? Ease up some…it’s only <em>me.</em>”</p>
<p>Concern trickled into Minako’s being. Rei wasn’t moving. Which only meant Rei regretted coming here. <em>You’re not running from me again, Hino.</em>..With  a quick jaunt, overriding her frayed nerves, the Singer took hold of  the situation. She slipped her hand about Rei’s own and tugged her  forth.</p>
<p>She snapped to at realizing that the warmth of the  Singer’s flesh made contact with her own. Rei had no choice. Minako  uncovered those long hidden buttons and knew how to push them to get to <em>her</em>. She found herself toddling off with the slightly excitable  cocoa eyed Songstress…and much to her surprise, hadn’t minded as much  as she thought she would have. Absently, her fingers interlaced with  Minako’s before tugging her hand in return. The Singer glanced back,  pausing in her stead. Rei noted the soft blushed hue covering the  woman’s cheeks. But dismissed it as the cold weather having affected  the now Californian.</p>
<p>“If you <em>pull</em> me any harder and I fall…I’m <em>suing</em> you.”</p>
<p>Minako’s  index finger slid the length of Rei’s own – a caressing reaction that  only came naturally for the Singer. She met Rei’s soulful gaze and  replied with a murmur,</p>
<p>“If I hurt you…I would <em>never</em> forgive myself.” Minako then flashed a smile announcing more prominently, “Did the doctors clear you to get wet?”</p>
<p>“Minako.”, warned Rei.</p>
<p>“Mm, right, it’s Winter – We’ll do the roller coaster instead.”</p>
<p>“You know…Forget <em>suing</em>, I’ll be dead by the end of the day.”</p>
<p>The  Singer let a soft laugh peel from her rose colored lips; life was  suddenly breathed into the woman and she welcomed it with a gentle  reassuring squeeze of her hand, and eased their way into the park.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>“What is this…The fourth one??”</p>
<p>“You wanted to follow.”</p>
<p>“So did <em>you.</em>”</p>
<p>“Only to keep <em>you</em> out of <em>trouble!</em>”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan, I <em>never</em> get into trouble. It just…happens to <em>find</em> me.”</p>
<p>Makoto  deadpanned at the grinning woman beside her. The brunette drew her gaze  towards the couple that was boarding yet another park ride. They had  been tailing Minako and Rei all afternoon long and it seemed that their  energy was limitless. It amazed Makoto at how different the two women  were from the previous outings. No tension existed between the polar  opposites. They shared laughs and seemed ultimately, at ease with one  another.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it great?” questioned Usagi out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“What? Having your lower extremities fall asleep on you?”</p>
<p>“Mako-chan…”</p>
<p>“As if <em>I’m</em> supposed to be trained in reading your mind, Usagi.”</p>
<p>“How  long have we been friends? You should be able to…”, Usagi chuckled  before continuing with her initial train of thought, “The way that  they’re acting. Like nothing else matters…”</p>
<p>“Mm,” Makoto smiled, “Except…they <em>aren’t</em> acting, are they?”</p>
<p>With  nary a response from Usagi, Makoto felt a slap to her arm. The double  bunned woman motioned with a jut of her chin. Hazel eyes swept the area  pinioning on Minako and Rei as they exited the massive Ferris Wheel.  Rei was animated apparently explaining something with much jocularity.  Minako covered her mouth in a fit of laughter, before demurely,  flirtatiously…resting a hand on Rei’s arm. Makoto and Usagi rolled  their eyes at that</p>
<p>“Minako needs a few new moves…” remarked Usagi as Makoto snorted.</p>
<p>“You think <em>you</em> can teach the Senshi of Love a <em>few moves</em>?”</p>
<p>“Better than you could,” winked the Odango tressed woman, “Shh! They’re coming.”</p>
<p>Behind  a mesh of neatly cropped bushes that could pass off for livestock, the  two bickering souls were crouched…Thankfully they were close enough to  pick up bits of the conversation…The tall brunette had to give it to  her shorter accomplice. Usagi knew how to pick the hiding spots.</p>
<p>In  no time, the crisp sound of Minako’s voice was heard. She was very  dressed down, almost looking unrecognizable. But… on the same token,  looked almost too American where she would stand out.</p>
<p>“Hungry?” It was Minako who had chirruped out the question.</p>
<p>Bringing her hobbling to a slow, Rei rubbed the nape of her neck and gave a lazy nod, “More thirsty than anything.”</p>
<p>The  Singer acknowledged with a singular bob to her head. She motioned  towards a vendor that was a bit a ways from the main thoroughfare of  the amusement park, “Quieter…They serve hot chocolate.”</p>
<p>The miko  eased herself forth, nursing her braced leg all the while. Minako  couldn’t help but laugh. Rei’s eyes flicked towards the Singer, her  full lips thinning. In an instant, the infamous fire was stoked. The  other woman was laughing at a very un-laughable situation, at least, in  her eyes.</p>
<p>“…yeah, well, would you <em>like</em> to see how funny it is?” threatened the miko.</p>
<p>“Will you calm down?”, cajoled Minako, bringing her laughter to a simmering chuckle.</p>
<p>“I find it very hilarious that I’m being laughed at by my <em>best friend</em>…I hate being <em>like</em> this, I’m not an inval--”</p>
<p>“…Am I really?”, interjected Minako, truncating the raven headed woman’s explanation.</p>
<p>The  miko’s eyes met Minako’s. The Singer’s countenance was angelic, even  behind those ridiculous rose tinted shades. There was naught but  sincerity within those eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to believe…you think of me as <em>that</em>,”  intimated Minako, before drawing herself ramrod stiff at the counter of  the Vendor once they had arrived. In rapid succession, the Star ordered  for the both of them. Rei watched the incognito woman quietly – no one  had recognized Minako, the Star. It was just she…and her friend, who  she…truthfully barely knew. There was no need to put on airs.</p>
<p>“I’ve always…<em>thought</em> about you, in that way,” she confessed softly after some time, hinting.  Her fingers nervously worked the canvass of her sweater. Of which she  thought, looked dreadful on her.</p>
<p>“You have a funny way of showing it, Hino.” Minako eased herself along side Rei, with nary a sound to her footfall.</p>
<p>Everything  the Singer did screamed polished sophistication, even the way that  statement was delivered had the right chemistry. The delivery and the  way those words rolled from Minako’s tongue...The miko felt a boil form  in the pit of her stomach. Rei was nowhere in the same league as Aino  Minako. Time did its duty – and the only constant thing was change. The  singular thread of commonality that remained the same was their names.  Rei found that this aggravated her more than she let on. She became  frustrated and slowly began to lose her control…</p>
<p>“Look,” she  found herself sniping out, “I was irritated, just got off the plane,  meeting your oh-so-wonderful boyfriend and at the same time seeing how  everyone went on with their lives while I…I was…left behi..”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…I don’t know how many ways to <em>show</em> you, <em>tell </em>you  how sorry I am…” interrupted Minako with desperation. Rei was upset.  The day was perfect, too perfect – they shared jokes, but it felt…too…<em>nice.</em> As if they didn’t know how to act around the other. She had hoped that  with the pair of them left alone, Minako could capture that long ago  time with the one person that meant…more to her than the air she  currently breathed in.</p>
<p>“Why are you sorry, you didn’t <em>do</em> anything…”</p>
<p>“Because…”,  Minako shook her head absently while her body deflated; her hand  clopped listlessly against her thigh, “Because of that, of <em>everything</em>…I’m… I’m just <em>sorry</em> we’re not…we’re not the same anymore.”</p>
<p>Minako <em>had</em> noticed, then thought Rei.</p>
<p>Rei’s  lips curled into a half-smirk. Without knowing, Minako eased the miko’s  state of duress with just her mere stuttering reaction. Aino Minako was  the most…endearing, wonderful woman alive. If before she were attracted  to the obstinate strength that Minako showed as leader of the senshi,  this version of the Singer, now captured Rei’s heart.</p>
<p>“I’m not hurt, am I?”</p>
<p>“Well…your leg…”</p>
<p>“Nevermind the leg. Emotionally.”</p>
<p>“Then…No.”</p>
<p>“You didn’t plan on this, did you?”</p>
<p>“…no.”</p>
<p>“Then quit being silly over something you couldn’t control. Things…<em>happened.</em> We can either roll with it…or…hold on to what<em> was.</em>”</p>
<p>Rei  dusted her left hand over jeans covered pant-leg then extended it  towards the Singer. Minako’s brow knit in confusion. The raven-haired  woman laughed, before clearing her throat, “Hino. Hino Rei. I travel  the world on behalf of a joint outreach program for Japan and the  United States,” she then rolled her shoulders in a genial shrug, “I  hear you’re some kind of Star? Unfortunately, I don’t listen to much  music…”</p>
<p>Hesitantly, Minako looked at Rei and decided the miko’s  brain must have been scrambled during one of the rides. But with more  consideration, the Singer nodded, understanding – <em>Rei and she would have another chance</em>.  She slipped her hand into Rei’s own, and in that instant a rush of  warmth spread within their bodies. She knew Rei felt it too; especially  with the sudden intake of air. Their eyes never left one another. And  for the first time since her return, Minako felt as if she were truly <em>home.</em></p>
<p>“Well…you’re not as barbarian as I’ve been told.”</p>
<p>Rei narrowed her eyes, but chuckled.</p>
<p>“Aino Minako, I’m just a woman who loves to sing. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>The  leaves about them tumbled at the mercy of Father Winter and his breath.  But they weren’t the only things troubled in his grasp. Usagi gave an  inward shudder as she polished off her drink. It was even barely a  minute that had past when she felt that stinging pressure applied to  her bladder. She had to go. And she had to go NOW. But…she hated going  alone.</p>
<p>“Ne, Mako-chan.”</p>
<p>Makoto’s ear was prominently  directed towards the quibbling of Minako and Rei. A smile had been  plastered over her lips as she eavesdropped. The former senshi of  thunder was tickled at how well those two truly got along. She decided  it was better than her favorite soap opera. An incessant tug on her  jacket sleeve though, drew her from her duty. Her eyes met Usagi’s.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I need to go use the restroom, come with?”</p>
<p>“Use a cup!” insisted Makoto.</p>
<p>She was only met with a blank stare of disbelief. Makoto rubbed the bridge of her nose in agitation.</p>
<p>“What about them…?”</p>
<p>Usagi  cast her hooded glance towards the not to far off pair. “They’re just  talking, nothing exciting, we’ll be back in no time. C’mon…there’s a  restroom just around the corner.”</p>
<p>With that, the odango headed woman slowly began to back from their bush covered hiding place.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Their  food had been done minutes ago. So they decided to nestle on to one of  the emptied picnic like tables, all set up before the stationed vendor.  Here…memories were bridged with reality.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, they  talked on end about their lives and what’s been happening to them. The  more they spoke, the more Minako felt enthralled by Rei. They had grown  and found their niches in two entirely different worlds. The miko told  of her adventures in places she could hardly pronounce and wove her  tales of her life abroad. Rei had always been the strongest willed of  the group and in a way…Minako envied her. Rei flew higher than most  dared to dream. While she, was in the proverbial Bird Cage. Still  waiting to be loosed.</p>
<p>Quiet had settled between the pair once  more, and the Singer’s mind couldn’t help but venture to that place she  didn’t want to face. Not this day, it was supposed to be she and Rei,  alone...Minako finished a morsel of her foodstuff – not daring to meet  the other woman’s gaze, breaking the sudden shroud of tension, she  murmured, “How does she take it? To see you leave to for these  places…never having to see you for weeks on end… ”</p>
<p>Rei glanced  towards Minako, her eyes must have danced with confusion. Because the  Star laughed uneasily, “Oh God…tell me you forget her name in the  throes of passion too, Hino…That’s a crime of passion.” Minako paused  plucking a few prunes from her steaming bread delight, her jaw tensed  but none the less she hoped she disguised the seething jealousy in  enunciating, “Is-A-Belle.”</p>
<p>The miko blushed with furious abandon  then began to cough in the midst of chewing on melon bread. As if that  wasn’t bad enough, the Styrofoam cup that was precariously nestled in  Rei’s grip, toppled. Some of its contents slopped over her sweater. The  raven haired woman winced as the cocoa managed to seep through her  outer wear and insulation. Minako dropped her own food, wasting no time  in taking Rei by the arm leading her towards the nearest lavatory.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Her  eyes skimmed the interior of the restroom. As with all Japanese public  realms, this was extremely well kept. Wide-eyed characters were drawn  on the walls, probably added there to keep children entertained. A  pleasant chime sounded within the area from the nearest clock hugging  the tiled walls. Makoto glanced up and noted that it had been a few  minutes since Usagi was in there.</p>
<p>“Are you done?”</p>
<p>No response…at least, nothing intelligible.</p>
<p>If she weren’t scuffing her feet, Usagi’s <em>personal</em> ambient sounds would have rung about the echoing room, grating on her nerves. Makoto needed to drown out the sounds <em>somehow</em>. Her over energized friend had grown a nasty tendency to <em>grunt</em> her frustrations almost too loudly in public restrooms. With another  cringe, the tall brunette clenched her teeth and hissed out,</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have drunk so much lemonade, Usagi…”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think…<em>ugh</em>…it was going to have THIS sort of an effect!”, protested the woman. “Just one ….<em>There!</em> Done!”</p>
<p>The  young mother had finally finished. She flushed the commode before  ushering out a nameless tune, something that she was always prone to do  after such…arduous trials. She hummed to her heart’s content all before  the sound of, who she assumed, Makoto’s feet thunderously colliding on  to the floors, came careening into the inner sanctum of the restroom.  By the way it was squeaking on the surface, Usagi could tell it was  frantic - urgent. Curious, Usagi peeled the door open to her stall. As  she slowly poked her head out…she meekly said,</p>
<p>“Ne?…Mak---!!”</p>
<p>Her  words were immediately silenced as a massive, yet demure hand covered  the majority of her face, shoving her backward into the tiny stall.  Were she not quick in her reaction, Usagi would have suffered from a  displaced backbone what with the force exerted. But as it stood, the  young mother whirled about, planting her hands before her to brace  herself against the marble walls of the stall. The only hurt she  suffered was a bruised ego and kneecaps. The latter of which collided  with the rim of the porcelain throne that now shared their space.  Whipping her head about, she sent her two tendrils smack into her  companion’s face, after Makoto had secured the stall door shut.</p>
<p>Even  before Usagi managed to eek anything out, even a grunt, Makoto’s hand  slapped unto the woman’s lips yet again, clamping the shorter woman’s  mouth shut. The stinging sent Usagi’s foot stomping onto Makoto’s own.  The tall brunette grimaced but didn’t relieve the pressure of her hand.  For the first time, in a long while felt the surge of adrenaline  throbbing in her veins. Makoto burrowed her hazel eyes on Usagi, urging  her to be quiet.</p>
<p>Satisfied, the one time manipulator of thunder  and readily more physical woman, turned her gaze towards one of the  gaping cracks of the stall, beckoning her friend to do the same.  Shadows of two women danced into the room, followed by their all too  familiar voices – Usagi finally came to stark realization.  Quietly…Makoto and Usagi pushed themselves flushed as they could to the  rear of the stall, cramping themselves onto the commode.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>It was disgusting at how Zoicite’s eyes transfixed over his body – Terry had always thought Minako’s <em>friend</em> was eerie. Platinum hair that was loosely pony-tailed, moon-pale skin  and eyes that could make anyone feel like divulging everything about  themselves to this…this…<em>homo freak</em>.</p>
<p>“Will you <em>quit</em> fuckin’ lookin’ at me like that,” Terry spat out angrily. He paced before the pianist, whom hadn’t relented with his gaze.</p>
<p>“Give me something <em>more </em>interesting to gawk at, then I will,” replied Zoicite, mirth dancing on his every word. He loved goading the American. Zoicite <em>loved</em> the black male’s fire. It was a turn on…tingling him in all the  necessary places. The pianist had always told Minako how he envied her.  She would just roll her eyes. Women, hetero women, he reasoned will  never understand a gay male’s needs…</p>
<p>Terry raised his arms in  exasperation before storming up to Zoicite and uttering, rather  heatedly, “Listen, Trixie – I just wanna know where m’girl’s at.”</p>
<p>Serenely Zoicite smiled, inching closely and murmuring, “At a…<em>meeting</em>,  quite important from the sound of it. She just said for you,” he  iterated slowly having placed his hands on Terry’s shoulders for  effect, “…to sit…<em>tight</em>.</p>
<p>Terry immediately slapped Zoicite’s hands away, “Fucking fruit. Keep yourself and any other of <em>your kind</em> away from me…” The Football star sneered before he continued his pacing.</p>
<p>With  a casual shrug of a shoulder, the pianist lounged back against his seat  and hoped that Minako was having a good a time as he was.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>With  her hands cupped beneath the faucet, lukewarm water pooled between  them. Not so much of a beat of hesitation lingered on her fore thoughts  as a healthy swath of the liquid, was doused on her features. Even as  she was still coughing up a lung, Hino Rei was not aware of the body  that stood in quiet support beside her. Her inner mind was too busy  reprimanding to notice a wit.</p>
<p><em>Idiot! Did you THINK you could lie to the woman? How could you forget?</em></p>
<p>The  answer came in the form of a gentle touch that developed into a  massage; crawling from the small of her back continuing to the nape of  her neck. Rei’s curtain of molasses hair was gently lifted from her  face. In an instant, the miko felt as if she forgot her own name, her  breath was wrestled from her lungs. Having lifted her eyes to look upon  herself through the mirror, she was met with an even gaze from deep  chocolate orbs.</p>
<p>Rei watched Minako, watching her; the Singer had  subtly allowed her gaze to lower, the tip of her tongue slipped forth,  lapping tenderly at her lower lip. Never once did the Singer’s  attentive hand and fingers cease the gentle kneading. But the  ministration became idle, lazed and lingering over her back. Slowly,  Rei turned to glance towards the Singer in silence from over her  shoulder. Searing tingles pulsed through her with every single  undulating motion provided by Minako’s able digits.</p>
<p>“…Better?”</p>
<p>She nodded mutely before finding her voice.</p>
<p>“Food…got  caught,” offered Rei softly, her tone was husked thanks to the volatile  coughing; the miko motioned towards her throat, “Wrong…wrong pipe.”  Turning about, she broke the contact…Her attentions were then forced  onto her sweater, ruined by the cocoa.</p>
<p>With a touch of a nod,  Minako quietly brought herself towards the nearest towel dispenser,  furthering the rift that developed. Her breath came in short ragged  spurts, moving in time with the thundering of her heartbeat. Being that  close to the Priestess berthed an unexpected reaction. It was an  anticipatory feeling. A slow burning between her thighs... As she  turned about, after having wet a few loose paper towels, Minako found  Rei was pressed against the farthest wall, slipping her bronzed kissed  fingers through her mane, pinning her dampened locks into a haphazard  ponytail.</p>
<p>She could not be away from Rei. Not for a beat.</p>
<p>Idly,  Rei’s fingers furiously worked at the darkened splotch of brown that  spotted her sweater. But Minako arrested her hands from their duties;  pushing the miko’s hands gently away. Invading the raven-haired woman’s  personal space…</p>
<p>“Hey…Stop. It’ll aggravate the fabric,” murmured Minako. “…Let me…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the whole point?”</p>
<p>Minako  ignored Rei’s comment. The deft, elegant digits of the singer surged  forth, using the dampened towels to attempt to remove the stain.</p>
<p>“I can do this.”</p>
<p>A soft laugh was elicited, “Mm. I know. You can do <em>anything</em>. Let someone else…for a change…do it for you.”</p>
<p>Slowly,  without raising her eyes, Minako began to lift Rei’s sweater, but  paused in as the miko’s body went rigid. “I’m not doing anything your…<em>lover…</em> wouldn’t do, Rei. I’m just cleaning the mess.” Her words fell from her  lips in a soft, raspy breath. Finally the woman dared to glance upward,  under a fan of her lashes. Minako could feel the heat of her blush  burning her cheeks; such a menial task had begun to incense the Singer.</p>
<p>“You act like you’ve never undressed before, Hino. And if you noticed…I’m almost certain we have the same anatomy…”</p>
<p>Mianko’s  light tease fell on deaf ears. Rei’s eyes could only focus on one  thing…the Singer’s lips; how they formed words…and how they puckered  just so, to make her ache. They were moving, rose colored,  full…beckoning to be captured. She was close…too close to her. How dare  she smile, how dare she breathe, if Rei were inclined…The Star wouldn’t  be permitted to deny her.</p>
<p>Rei had to have her.</p>
<p>Rei needed to claim her…</p>
<p>Her mouth in all its delectable salty…sweetness.</p>
<p>But  she resisted and forced her eyes away, she had to…she would have been  made a fool for acting on her needs, with Minako so close, the signals  were getting crossed. Hino Rei may have had her fair share of romantic  trysts they never went father than the experimental stage…truth be  told…She remained as <em>virgin white</em> as the first snow-fall.</p>
<p>The  adage out of sight, out of mind flurried in her thoughts, it was a  silent mantra that didn’t work. Rei couldn’t stop that throbbing that  erupted at her center. The warmth of the Singer’s hand drew Rei’s  attention back, their eyes fully met.</p>
<p>“You haven’t heard a thing I said, have you?”</p>
<p>The  miko’s brow furrowed, her lips parted before offering a soft negating  exhale of air that she hadn’t realized, she was holding in. Rei was  helpless. And under a spell she didn’t know how to, nor want to break.</p>
<p>Minako  nodded sympathetically, catching the first hints of the miko’s  frustration – and her own confusion; she began to wonder how it would  be like…to be with another woman. And not any other, it <em>had</em> to be Rei.</p>
<p>“You’re still wet…”, said Minako softly.</p>
<p>The  Star moved closer, the gap becoming non-existent now. They were  breathing in the other’s essence. Minako eased her hand upward, pushing  Rei’s cascaded bangs from her eyes. The Singer used the tatty paper  towel to dry the stunned priestess’ face. Her knee coasted forth,  touching the Rei’s inner thigh. The first request for permission…Minako  knew this game and she knew it well. It’s been much too long since  she’s played it – she’s never had reason to. Till Rei.</p>
<p>“…Is that how you watch <em>her?</em>”  Minako murmured – not bothering to hide the jealous pang that clung to  her words; her delicate finger tips traced the proud miko’s features,  ghosting tenderly before they feathered over Rei’s full lips.</p>
<p>“I…saw <em>how</em> you looked at me…I’m here, Rei…I’m flesh…It’s only you and I.”</p>
<p>The  raven-headed woman arched her back, taking in air to feed her deprived  lungs. Her strong will did not pay dividends, her mouth watered, she  hungered and she couldn’t hold on to her <em>sanity</em>. Timid at first  and before she realized, her body acted on its own accord. Rei’s lips  parted – allowing the pads of Minako’s fingers slight entrance.</p>
<p>Taking  that as a sign, the Star applied steady pressure, furthering her middle  finger into Rei’s mouth. Minako was met with a surge of electrical  pulses coursing her spine…The miko had fully given her access to her  mouth. The soft muscle of Rei’s tongue, bathed the probing intruder.  Minako’s throat constricted letting loose a garbled moan.</p>
<p>Her  teeth, tongue and lips worked simultaneously – urged on by not only her  erupting arousal, but with Minako’s reactions. The Singer…seemed to  like what she was doing. With Rei’s free hand, the miko lightly brushed  her own digits along the Singer’s side, moving up tracing the Star’s  hidden body – gently, she arrested Minako’s wrist, guiding the hand and  its fingers firmly into the depths of her waiting mouth. Lovingly, Rei  sucked and nipped each digit, never wavering her ruddy eyed orbs from  Minako’s own.</p>
<p>Pulling her fingers free, they trailed from Rei’s  lips, leaving a slick path of the woman’s saliva over her chin. With  barely a word uttered – Minako let her dampened fingers trawl further  down Rei’s body, resting gently at the swell of the priestess’ left  breast – the Singer’s thumb brushed over Rei’s already taut nipple..  The proud erection making a show, barely through the miko’s loose  sweater. She teased the nodule mercilessly. Shyly Minako then pressed  herself closer to Rei, wedging her knee between her friend’s thighs and  upward to impart a delicious moan tearing from Rei’s throat.</p>
<p>The  raven-headed woman arched her back, thrusting her chest forward from  the sudden pressure to her hidden nub. It sent torrents of lust through  her, ripping her sense and sensibility apart. Covered in a veil of  want, Rei gutturally growled, before firmly cupping Minako’s face and  drawing her in…</p>
<p>Her lips her forcibly claimed, the game of  exploration had barely begun for Minako…the expert…She found herself  drowning under Rei’s impassioned assault. Lips played over lips, it was  sloppy…it was heated, and it drove her mad. She wanted Rei. Here. Now.  Minako could have sworn she could smell her arousal seeping through her  clothes. And with the way Rei’s probing tongue pistoned into her mouth,  Minako thought Rei had, as well.</p>
<p>Rei HATED these clothes…they  were confining, they were in her way – desperately, she groped for the  edge of Minako’s shirt, pulling them untucked. She needed to feel  her…her best friend…And she was rewarded supple flesh greeted Rei’s  fingertips. Minako’s toned stomach shuddered at her touch. Rei <em>loved </em>it.  She forced a position change, pinning Minako to the wall. Her searing  kiss never ceased…She wanted to give the Singer the angry, lustful pain  she was receiving. Mimicking…Rei surged her firm thigh between Minako’s  own.</p>
<p>She found herself straddling Rei’s leg…Minako’s head peeled  back, calling out the miko’s name. Minako was wet…sopping wet, eagerly,  her hips began to rock with abandon over the firm muscle. She was  getting close, she didn’t want to crest…not without knowing Rei <em>fully</em>.  Pulling her head forth once more, Minako whimpered her request and was  thankfully…fiercely afforded with another firm kiss from Rei.</p>
<p>“Take me…please…Rei…now.”, she breathlessly pleaded breaking the sensitized kiss.</p>
<p>Rei pulled back, her eyes betraying her, helplessly, she tried to reply….</p>
<p>But…the  sound of a pained thud and yowl dressed the restroom. Rei pulled from  Minako quickly, her heart still rampaging dizzied from the height of  what occurred. She was barely cognizant of the voices that echoed in  the Spartan room. Not until the utterance of a name pulled Rei from her  limbo.</p>
<p>“U…SA…GI!”</p>
<p>Anger boiled within the miko. With  prominent strides, hampered only by her braced leg, Rei scoured the  stalls, finding the pair in a mass of entangled limbs.</p>
<p>Makoto and  Usagi, both beet with embarrassment glanced upward at their friends.  The only answer to offer was a simple one…and one that…was the truth…In  a twisted version.</p>
<p>“I…had to use the restroom.”</p>
