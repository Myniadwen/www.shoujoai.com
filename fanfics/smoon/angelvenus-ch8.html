<h1>Angel of Venus (part 8 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/smsupremia.html">Supremia</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Set me free...the wind howls, I am screaming. This cage, I cannot. Do 
you hear it? The Dark Angel approaches. Traitorous fool. With eyes of 
jade, and a black sword on her back...She plays the hero now? Kazuki? 
My...friend, my opposite. I care for her so deeply...Awaken. Show her 
who you are. Remember. You Are...

I Am...

Hikari. The Light. Blessed light, embrace me, us all, in the hour of 
darkness. May the souls of the wicked damned be forced into the 
brilliant glory of My Aura. Remember. Always. Until it is time...for 
me...

Kazuki winced, shutting her eyes tightly as the area around them was 
filled with a bright, blinding light. For a moment, all she saw was 
white, and then a flash of silver and bright green. Mitsuki hurtled out 
of the light, sprinting toward Kazuki. The older woman barely lifted her 
arms in time to block the attack. She staggered backwards, and then gave 
Mitsuki a predatory grin. In the distance, she saw three others, and 
frowned. Senshi, she imagined. She saw their auras even from here.

&quot;Beautiful...&quot; the dark-haired woman murmured. &quot;They are so bright, so 
lovely.&quot; She unsheathed her sword, and nodded, closing her eyes for a 
moment. &quot;This will certainly be interesting, won&#39;t it? Well then, 
Mitsuki,&quot; she murmured, addressing the youth who stood a short distance 
away, seething. &quot;Let us begin.&quot;

------------------------------------------------------------

tell me what the rain knows

The smoke turns the whole sky raven black

And the world upon your back will crack

Where will you go

Now you&#39;ve no home?

Let the rain wash away your last days....

-Maaya Sakamoto, Tell Me What the Rain Knows

--------------

&quot;You must be careful, Venus,&quot; Pluto admonished, wincing slightly when a 
blast of cold wind washed past them. &quot;This woman is dangerous. Her 
darkness...I can feel it.&quot;

&quot;A dark aura,&quot; Saturn murmured. Her Glaive glinted against the bright 
sun. &quot;But there is some good in her, I think.&quot;

Venus frowned, shaking her head. &quot;She&#39;s attacking Mitsuki, and she&#39;s one 
of those women...&quot;

Saturn frowned, giving the blonde-haired Senshi a cool, level gaze. Her 
eyes were unreadable, and Venus shuddered slightly. &quot;Mitsuki attacked 
first,&quot; the youngest Senshi pointed out, watching the two warriors fight 
amongst the snow, &quot;and the other retaliated. She&#39;s defending herself.&quot;

&quot;We wait,&quot; Pluto added.

Venus frowned. &quot;You two can wait. I&#39;m going! Venus Love-me Chain!&quot; The 
bright golden chain shot out of her hands, gripping Kazuki around her 
neck. The dark warrior choked, gasping for air. She glanced up at 
Mitsuki, who had stopped, and now stood glancing at the golden-haired 
Senshi curiously. Venus tugged tighter on the whip, and Kazuki could 
feel the chain burning into her skin, feel heat against her palms, her 
face. She growled in frustration, trying to tug the energy chain off of 
her neck, to no avail. She sunk to her knees and winced, grabbing the 
chain again. Her eyes flashed for a moment, and dark energy snaked from 
her palms, wrapping around the brilliant, bright energy of Venus&#39; 
attack. The chain faltered, turned black, and then evaporated into 
nothing. Kazuki stood to her feet, and then waved a hand, sending a 
blast of dark energy to catch Mitsuki squarely in the chest. The younger 
girl gasped in pain and flew backwards, knocking against the 
snow-covered ground and landing on her back. She struggled to get up, 
but Kazuki snapped her fingers, and shadow energy pulled from the 
ground, wrapping around the white-haired girl. Mitsuki screamed in pain 
as the searing magic snapped around her, threatening to pull the very 
light she so cherished from her.

Kazuki turned to the Senshi now, and she was no longer playful.

&quot;You&#39;re a funny little girl,&quot; she murmured. &quot;And very stupid.&quot; She 
sighed a bit sadly. &quot;This was a battle between Mitsuki and me. But you 
had to intervene. No matter. I was ordered not to kill you. Though 
hurting you...that, I believe, is allowed.&quot;

Mitsuki&#39;s screams raised in pitch, guttural and torn from very deep in 
her chest. It almost sounded inhuman; her sharp, piercing yells made the 
serene atmosphere seem surreal, unnatural. Venus shook in anger, 
clenching her fists. &quot;Stop it! You&#39;re hurting her!&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the point, you little twit. She&#39;s supposed to die, don&#39;t you get 
it by now? Out of my way. Let me finish my task.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;s your friend! Why do you want to hurt her?&quot;

&quot;Do not try to understand what you cannot. Many fools have lost lives 
doing so. And this is too confusing for most.&quot; She shrugged her 
shoulders, glancing at the two other Senshi who had not opted to assist 
their blonde friend as of now. &quot;You should step down while you can. 
Become an observer in this war.&quot;

&quot;Shut up! Set Mitsuki free now! Venus Love-Me Chain!&quot;

The golden chain shot out from Venus&#39; palms again, but Kazuki was 
prepared this time. She dodged agilely, volleying a hail of what 
appeared to be black spheres at the Senshi. The spheres cracked with 
bright purple energy, and Venus back flipped, feinting to avoid the 
attack. Kazuki watched in slight amusement, and then waved a hand, 
directing the energy spheres around. The Senshi dodged artfully, but it 
was only a matter of time before fatigue would win over. Mitsuki&#39;s 
screams of pain had stopped, finally, but Kazuki still felt the ghostly 
pull of her aura leaking through. She was alive, but barely. Just a 
moment longer, and they could finish...

&quot;Dead Scream...&quot; a whisper carried over the sound of the wind, and 
Kazuki turned quickly. Her eyes widened as a massive, purple sphere of 
light hurtled toward her, blasting into her side. Her control over her 
attacks broke, and Mitsuki collapsed onto the snow-covered ground, steam 
rising from her body. Kazuki hurtled across the street, knocking 
violently into a streetlight. The post dented from the force of her 
fall, and she was still for a moment before struggling to her feet, 
groaning in pain and confused anger. She winced, wobbling unsteadily, 
and wiped a trail of blood from the side of her face.

&quot;Oh, that is IT. Which one of those...&quot; The dark warrior gazed around 
desperately, trying to find a target. The woman gasped and shock and 
swung her sword up, barely blocking the dangerous, curved blade of the 
Silence Glaive. Sailor Saturn stared down at her impassively, and 
pushed, muscles tensing with the effort to break Kazuki&#39;s hold on her 
weapon. The older woman broke away, swinging her sword to block each of 
Saturn&#39;s skilled moves. Her concentration on the attacks toward Venus 
and Mitsuki had broken however, and Venus immediately ran over to the 
white-haired girl, trying to shake her awake.

&quot;Mitsuki! Come on! Get up!&quot;

The girl simply groaned weakly in response, her head lolling to the 
side. The armor disappeared, as did the sword, and she was once again 
clad in civilian clothing. Venus shook her again, her voice rising into 
a desperate pitch.

&quot;Come on, Mitsuki! Get up, please!&quot;

&quot;W...why...Kazu...hurts so much...&quot; the white haired girl whispered 
hoarsely, putting a hand to her chest. &quot;Hurts everywhere...&quot; Tears 
sprung into her eyes, and she turned her face away. &quot;Why?&quot;

Venus cradled the slightly smaller young woman, staring at the battle 
unfolding in front of her. Her eyes narrowed. &quot;It&#39;s alright...okay? 
Pluto and Saturn will take care of her...&quot;

&quot;You...&quot; Mitsuki glanced up, wincing as she tried to sit up. &quot;You saved 
me the last time...Who are you?&quot;

&quot;You saved me too,&quot; Venus pointed out. &quot;And I&#39;m Sailor Venus, pretty 
sailor-suited soldier of love and beauty, at your service! Are you okay 
though? Can you stand?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; the girl struggled to move, and then collapsed, gasping in pain 
and exhaustion. &quot;Sorry. I can&#39;t...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright...why don&#39;t you relax. Sleep. I&#39;ll get you home safely, 
okay?&quot;

&quot;Okay...I&#39;m...really tired. Will I...will I see you again?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh!&quot; Venus grinned. &quot;Sure, you&#39;ll see me again. I promise.&quot;

Mitsuki smiled wanly and pulled herself up slowly, gently brushing her 
lips against Venus&#39; own. &quot;Thank you,&quot; she mumbled sleepily, closing her 
eyes.

Venus blushed and pressed a gloved hand to her mouth. &quot;You&#39;re 
welcome...&quot; she mumbled in surprise.

Meanwhile, Kazuki desperately tried to dodge the melee attacks from the 
two Outers, growling in frustration. She lost her focus for a moment, 
and Saturn&#39;s glaive cleaved through the air, catching her in the side, 
tearing through her coat, and into delicate flesh. She bit down on her 
lip until it bled, to keep from screaming out, and whirled on the 
smaller Senshi.

&quot;I grow tired of this. Finite,&quot; she stated calmly, though the burning 
pain below her ribs was almost enough to make her pass out. Shadow 
energy surrounded the fighters, and Kazuki embraced it, glancing out at 
the group.

&quot;A pity,&quot; she addressed Pluto. I had hoped to talk amicably with you. 
And you,&quot; she muttered, glancing over at Venus, and Mitsuki. &quot;This is 
not over. Goodbye.&quot; And she was gone then, as suddenly as she came. 
Saturn glanced down at the crimson spot in the white snow and frowned, 
shaking her head.

&quot;Persistent.&quot;

&quot;Venus!&quot; Pluto called. &quot;Take Mitsuki back inside!&quot;

Venus obeyed, gently hefting the smaller girl up. In her transformed 
state, she was a bit stronger, and as such, Mitsuki&#39;s weight would not 
be as much, though she was still a bit heavy. When she arrived back 
inside the Outers&#39; abode, she gently set Mitsuki down on a couch and 
detransformed, frowning at the array of nasty scratches across the other 
girl&#39;s face.

&quot;I&#39;m really sorry...wow...that lady was something else. And you...&quot; she 
shook her head, brushing strands of golden-blonde hair from her face. 
&quot;You were just tired, I bet. Didn&#39;t know what you were doing. Or maybe 
it&#39;s a funny custom from your planet to run around kissing people when 
they save your butt, huh?&quot; She laughed, weakly. &quot;Yeah. That&#39;s it.&quot;

&quot;Wha...?&quot; Mitsuki&#39;s eyes opened slowly, and she frowned, shaking her 
head. &quot;Minako? Huh? Wh-where am I?&quot; She stood up suddenly, and reeled, 
slumping back on to the couch. &quot;Where&#39;s Kazuki? And those women, the 
Senshi?&quot;

&quot;Whoa, whoa!&quot; Minako grinned, cocking her head to one side. &quot;One at a 
time! All of those questions! You know what they say, &#39;Curiosity kicked 
the chicken.&#39;&quot;

Mitsuki raised an eyebrow. &quot;I...I beg your pardon? Um...anyway. 
I...Kazuki left? Oh! Setsuna and Hotaru! And you! Are you alright?&quot;

&quot;That scary lady? Yeah, she left. Setsuna and Hotaru are fine, and so am 
I. The Senshi came just in time and kicked her butt!&quot;

&quot;They did? Oh...I sort of remember...oh! Venus! She saved me again! Oh, 
I was probably too forward...but...she was very brave...&quot; Mitsuki sighed 
wistfully, sinking deeper into the couch cushions. Minako frowned.

Weird... &quot;What did you do?&quot;

&quot;Oh...I...&quot; Mitsuki glanced down and blushed. &quot;Well, I kissed her. It&#39;s 
proper etiquette to do that, right? I&#39;ve been kissed a couple of times 
by people I&#39;ve saved, but I&#39;m not so sure if your planet is the same...&quot;

&quot;Well, we don&#39;t usually do things like that,&quot; Minako muttered, and then 
quickly amended when she saw the horrified look on the other girl&#39;s 
face. &quot;But I&#39;m sure she didn&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot;

&quot;Yeah, really! In fact, I&#39;m positive,&quot; Minako said, with utmost 
seriousness.

---------------

Kazuki leaned slightly on a wall for support as she walked down the 
large, empty hallways to the room. A young man, tall and lanky, with 
golden-blonde hair that spiked all about his head glanced at her as she 
dragged herself past him.

&quot;Kazu! You cool?&quot;

&quot;I am most certainly not cool, Ginrou,&quot; Kazuki whispered through 
clenched teeth. &quot;And I told you to quit calling me that.&quot;

&quot;Right, right.&quot; The boy grinned cheekily. &quot;Need some help?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d...appreciate it,&quot; Kazuki responded reluctantly, sighing. &quot;Please 
lead me to her room. And keep your hands above my waist and below my 
chest, or I&#39;ll ignore my injury in favor of kicking your skull in.&quot;

Ginrou nodded, his grin widening. &quot;Can&#39;t make any promises, sweetheart. 
But I&#39;ll try, you know.&quot;

&quot;You better,&quot; Kazuki hissed, leaning against his shoulder for support. 
&quot;Or nothing in the world will save you.&quot;

&quot;Feisty today, huh? Who kicked the Great Kazuki&#39;s ass anyway? Must have 
been some kinda amazing.&quot;

&quot;A little girl,&quot; Kazuki responded coldly, wincing at the pain in her 
side. &quot;With a very big stick.&quot;

&quot;Must have been a damn big stick,&quot; Ginrou whistled, impressed. &quot;We&#39;re 
here though. Last stop.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Kazuki said, slipping away from his grasp, and turning 
toward the door. &quot;You were surprisingly chilva--&quot; She stopped when she 
felt a familiar squeeze on her backside.

The loud smack, and Kazuki&#39;s following scream of, &quot;PERVERT!&quot; echoed 
throughout the empty hall.

Ginrou laughed, running off and holding his bruised cheek, while 
shooting spheres of bright, white electricity at the shadow spheres 
volleyed his way. &quot;Come on! I said I couldn&#39;t keep promises!&quot;

Kazuki only growled in reply, cursing under her breath when his laughter 
faded. &quot;I knew I shouldn&#39;t have let him touch me...&quot; she quietly made 
into the room, frowning at the darkness. &quot;Are you in here?&quot;

&quot;I am. Ginrou?&quot;

&quot;Pervert,&quot; Kazuki hissed. &quot;Why can&#39;t he grow up?&quot;

&quot;He is...Ginrou,&quot; the woman responded. &quot;He is energy itself, never 
still, and never silent. I trust he took his liberties with you? Again?&quot; 
She sighed weakly. &quot;Honestly, you would think he&#39;d grow tired of the 
constant thrashings he&#39;s received...&quot;

&quot;You would think that, but Ginrou never thinks, so that point is moot.&quot; 
Kazuki slumped into a chair and winced, unable to stifle a hiss of pain. 
&quot;I ran into a bit of trouble...&quot;

&quot;The girl?&quot; the woman asked, moving toward Kazuki to check her wound.

&quot;The girl. Nasty weapon she&#39;s got.&quot;

&quot;I told you...&quot;

&quot;I know, and I&#39;m sorry for not listening. But could you fix this? I 
really don&#39;t want to bleed all over your chair.&quot; She frowned, and if one 
did not know Kazuki, they would have sworn she was pouting. &quot;And this 
was my favorite jacket...&quot;

The woman laughed. &quot;There will be other jackets, Kazuki.&quot;

-----------

&quot;Sooo...&quot; Minako rocked back and forth on the heels of her feet, &quot;What 
do you want to do now?&quot; The two girls had left the Outers shortly after 
Mitsuki was well enough to walk, and they were now heading toward 
Minako&#39;s home.

&quot;Well...I suppose I ruined our day together, hm?&quot;

&quot;Huh? Oh, no! Not at all! Weird stuff happens...you can&#39;t really prevent 
that!&quot; Minako said, laughing nervously. Mitsuki gave her an odd look, 
and glanced down at her feet.

&quot;I bet you think I don&#39;t like you...&quot;

&quot;Huh? to think of it...&quot; Minako frowned. &quot;You sure do jump a lot when 
I&#39;m around, and you avoid me a lot...do you like me?&quot;

&quot;I...&quot; Mitsuki trailed off. &quot;It&#39;s complicated. But I don&#39;t have a 
problem with you at all. It&#39;s...it&#39;s me. I don&#39;t know why, but...I&#39;m 
sorry, for what it&#39;s worth.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s okay, I guess,&quot; Minako said, scratching her head. &quot;Let&#39;s get you 
home, okay?&quot;

&quot;Oh, but I...&quot; Mitsuki sighed weakly. &quot;Alright.&quot; </pre>
