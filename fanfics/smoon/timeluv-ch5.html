<h1>No Time for Love (part 5 of 13)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/prince_kitten.html">Prince_Kitten</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/timeluv-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>&quot;All right, ready to say your goodbyes?&quot; 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about us, we&#39;ll be fine.&quot; Ami said and Rei nodded.

&quot;We can handle Mosquito-san so just relax for a while okay? See you 
soon&quot; 

Setsuna leaned back into the chair she was seated in as the tape went 
static. After an emergency call from Luna, the whole group had gathered 
at Makoto&#39;s apartment. Some argument about a possible bomb or 
brain-washing waves later, they had all concluded that they couldn&#39;t not 
watch the tape. Kira&#39;s serious hurt-filled eyes had burned themselves 
into Setsuna and she shivered, still hearing that pain and anger in her 
voice. Around the room everyone was silent, not entirely sure what to do 
now. It was Haruka who spoke first.

&quot;Is it possible that they were brain-washed? Could that be why they 
toldus to lay off for a while?&quot; She asked, squeezing Michiru&#39;s hand. 
They all turned from the blank TV to Setsuna and she suddenly found 
herself the resident expert. Thinking for a moment she shook her head.

&quot;They might have been put at ease, but they weren&#39;t brainwashed. The 
whole reason Kira-san took them was to find lifemates. If all she wanted 
was mindless dolls, she wouldn&#39;t have needed to go any further than 
people she feeds from. Brainwashing them would have been pointless.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she just did it long enough for them to talk to us and tell us 
that they&#39;re okay?&quot; Usagi questioned. Setsuna sighed and looked over at 
her. Mamoru was sitting beside her, holding her hand tightly. He had 
been away at college but had come home as quickly as possible once he&#39;d 
been informed of what was happening.

&quot;You tell me Princess. Even if it was just a tape, you can sense them. 
Was that really Rei-chan and Ami-chan? Or was it some mindless version?&quot; 
Usagi looked down, not unsure, just unwilling. Finally she looked up to 
see Makoto and Minako focused on her. She gave a regretful half-smile 
and leaned into Mamoru for support.

&quot;No, that was them. I could feel them, even through the tape. Feel 
their... happiness, their relaxation.&quot; Both Makoto and Minako winced and 
Setsuna nodded to herself. Kira worked fast to get them at ease this 
quickly. Even she was surprised that it had only taken a few days.*But 
then, Kira does have a way of making you feel special* Setsuna sighed 
and shook her head.

&quot;Regardless of what they said, I think we should keep trying to find 
them. If it only took a few days for her to get them to tell us to wait 
on finding them, think of what a week or two might do.&quot; Michiru said 
with some concern.

&quot;I agree. Even if they do want a vacation, I think we should try to 
find them.&quot; Artimes said from his place in Minako&#39;s lap and nods were 
chorused around the room. 

&quot;Well, for now I think we should all go our own ways and brainstorm 
ideas separately. Let&#39;s all meet again here tomorrow and compare. Maybe 
we can think of something.&quot; Luna said but Makoto shook her head.

&quot;The landlord is fumigating tomorrow. I&#39;m not supposed to come home all 
day.&quot; Luna sighed and bit her lip until Haruka spoke up.

&quot;We could all meet at our place. No parents to worry about, no nosey 
neighbors, and plenty of room.&quot;

Everyone nodded and started to leave quietly. Noticing that both 
Makoto and Minako were staring at her and fidgeting in their seats 
instead of heading for the door, Setsuna remained seated herself. Usagi 
walked past with Luna on her shoulder, holding Mamoru&#39;s hand tightly. 
She paused as Luna spoke to Setsuna.. &quot;Setsuna, this may be difficult, 
but try to remember everything you can about her and what happened. I 
know it was a long time ago, but you&#39;re the only link we have to this 
girl.&quot; Setsuna only nodded as Usagi,Mamoru and Luna continued out the 
door, Artimes following on the ground. *Difficult to remember? Ha. I can 
remember everything from then. Every little detail like it was just 
yesterday. No matter how hard I try to forget* 

Once the door shut she turned to Makoto and Minako who were both 
staring at her, a mixture of apprehension and determination on their 
faces. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and blew it out before 
addressing them.

&quot;Yes?&quot; She asked simply and after a bit of eye play between the two of 
them Minako spoke first.

&quot;Setsuna-san, when Kira-san fist appeared she, well, she said we were 
just as slow in this life as in the last. And she said that we were the 
ones hurting Ami-chan and Rei-chan. Is that because... I mean, are 
we...&quot; Minako trailed off and looked at Makoto for help.

&quot;Are Ami-chan and Rei-chan, well, are we the ones they...&quot; The brunette 
trailed off as well and they both looked at Setsuna, a forlorn look on 
their faces. Setsuna gave a half-smile.

&quot;Yes. You are the ones that Ami-chan and Rei-chan were in love with in 
the last life. As well as this one.&quot; Setsuna watched as their eyes 
widened and separately they ducked their eyes, apparently in shock.

&quot;Really?&quot; Minako questioned and Setsuna only nodded. &quot;Rei-chan is... 
with me?&quot; Minako said to herself, sort of in shock. Makoto was just 
staring at the floor, shaking her head. &quot;Is that why Kira-san took them? 
Because we wouldn&#39;t love them back?&quot; Setsuna pursed her lips, trying to 
decide between telling them everything and just what they needed to 
know. Seeing the lost look in Makoto&#39;s eyes as she looked up and the 
pained look on Minako&#39;s faceshe made her decision.

&quot;Eventually you would return their feelings.&quot; She said slowly. &quot;Rei-san 
would&#39;ve waited another 50 years or so before confessing her love to you 
Minako-san. And only once the two of you had settled down would you and 
Ami-can get together Makoto-san.&quot; Makoto stared at the floor again and 
Minako shook her head.

&quot;That&#39;s a long time for them to wait.&quot; She whispered and Setsuna nodded.

&quot;That is the other reason why searching for them at the moment may 
prove fruitless.&quot; Seeing the confused looks she got Setsuna smiled 
gently. &quot;Even if we can think of a way to find them and contact them, the 
only way to get them back may be to offer them something Kira-san 
can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;Us.&quot; Makoto whispered and Setsuna nodded again.

&quot;Given that it would be so long before you would return their feelings, 
could you really offer your love now?&quot; The girls were silent and Setsuna 
watching the emotions swirl on their faces. After a while Minako slowly 
stood.

&quot;I need to...to think for a bit.&quot; She said and walked to the door. 
Makoto gave her a half-hearted wave, still focused on the floor. Once 
Minako had left Setsuna stood as well and turned to leave when Makoto 
spoke her name.She looked over at the girl who was looking up at her 
confused.

&quot;Setsuna-san, please, tell me how we...how Ami and I...how we get 
together.&quot; Setsuna closed her eyes and focused for a moment, bringing up 
visions of a future that would now never exist.

&quot;After Rei-san and Minako-san got together, you were talking to Minako 
and were asking her how it was that she fell for Rei-san. She said that 
she had just looked at Rei-san when she had confessed her love and had 
just known that she was in love with her too. That apparently made you 
realize that you had been in love with Ami-chan all along. You went to 
her with your feelings and fate took over.&quot; Makoto was silent and looked 
off to the side. Her face contorted into a thoughtful expression and 
Setsuna couldn&#39;t help feeling curious. 

&quot;I guess, if I said I had been in love with her all along, then I must 
be in love with her now.&quot; Setsuna raised her eyebrow and watched as 
Makoto sagged into the couch, still looking very confused. Setsuna 
sighed and turned to leave the girl with her thoughts. The door shutting 
didn&#39;t even break Makoto from her concentration. Years of lunches, sleep 
overs and school days were swirling through her head. Ami smiling at her 
when they first met, dancing at the ball. An innocent touch here, a hug 
there. She couldn&#39;t deny her interest in the young genius. When they 
fought, she always went to Mercury&#39;s side. We they all ate out at the 
Crown, somehow they always sat next to each other. Recently, they had 
been getting closer. Makoto couldn&#39;t help the smile on her face, 
remembering a week ago.

******	&quot;Thanks for your help Ami-chan. I hate history.&quot; Ami grinned 
up at her tall friend.

&quot;Really, it&#39;s no problem Mako-chan. I like being able to help my 
friends. Besides, Mother had to work a double shift again so it&#39;s quiet 
and lonely at my house.&quot; Makoto smiled at Ami softly and scooted next to 
her. 

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Ami-chan. She&#39;s had to work late a lot lately hasn&#39;t she?&quot; 
Ami nodded in response. 

&quot;Yeah, but it&#39;s okay. She&#39;s had to work late before. That&#39;s the price 
for being a Doctor.&quot; Ami straightened up and smiled at Makoto. &quot;I should 
get used to it now since my schedule will likely be the same once I 
become a Doctor.&quot; Makoto could easily see through Ami&#39;s false bravado 
and thought quickly.

&quot;You know, it&#39;s pretty late. Why don&#39;t you just stay here tonight? You 
could call and leave your Mother a message.&quot; Ami shook her head. 

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to be a burden Mako-chan. Besides, I only have this 
uniform with me.&quot; Makoto grinned and ruffled Ami&#39;s hair gently. 

&quot;You could never be a bother to me Ami-chan. And we can clean your 
uniform you know. I have to do a load of laundry anyway, okay?&quot; The 
greatfull look on Ami&#39;s face said it all and Makoto had smiled broadly. 

******

Makoto leaned back into her couch and grinned. She&#39;d gone in the back 
to clean the uniforms and after they&#39;d been washed, dried and hung up she 
had returned to the living room where she had left Ami reading on the 
couch, cuddled up in one of her nightshirts which was more than long 
enough for Ami. 

******	&quot;Okay Ami-chan. They&#39;re all...&quot; Makoto stopped talking once 
in the room. Ami had fallen asleep curled around her book. Her glasses 
seemed to have fallen off, resting at her feet on the floor. Makoto 
smiled gently and took Ami&#39;s book away. Picking up her glasses she 
carried them into her bedroom and set them on the nightstand, then 
returned to Ami. Leaning over she slid one arm under Ami&#39;s knees and the 
other under her arms, gently lifting the girl from the couch. Makoto 
carried Ami into the bedroom and carefully laid her down on one side of 
the bed. She tucked Ami in gently and went to her own side of the bed, 
snuggling in and turning to the blue-haired girl. She reached out and 
brushed a bit of Ami&#39;s hair behind her ear. Ami smiled in her sleep and 
whispered.

&quot;Mako-chan.&quot; Makoto was slightly startled, but waved it off as Ami being 
greatfull for her help. 

****** 

Ami had made little noises in her sleep for most of the night. Makoto 
hadn&#39;t been able to figure out what she had been saying except that Ami 
had whispered her name quite a few times. Thinking back, Makoto couldn&#39;t 
help but laugh as she remembered how startled Ami was in the morning 
when she found them sleeping in the same bed. Makoto hadn&#39;t seen what 
the big deal was, but Ami had flushed all morning. With a start Makoto 
realized what kind of dream Ami must have been having to make her flush 
like that, and exactly why she had been whispering Makoto&#39;s name. A 
blush came over Makoto&#39;s features as she thought about it, curious as to 
why she hadn&#39;t realized that before. *Because how could I have guessed 
Ami was in love with me? * she thought. * I don&#39;t know how I could have 
missed it though. Knowing what I know now, looking back on our time 
together, all the times she would smile so softly at me, all the times 
she was so concerned about me...She...she loves me. Ami-chan...my 
Ami-chan...loves me.* 

A goofy grin appeared on Makoto&#39;s face. Tilting her head to the side 
she brought up times in her head when it seemed as though Ami was sitting 
a little to close. Times when she would lean in as their eyes met. And 
slowly, she begin to picture herself scooting closer. Leaning close to 
Ami, closing her eyes slowly. It wouldn&#39;t have occurred to her to do 
that, that she could do that, until now. Or until Minako had told her 
hat she had been in love with her best friend. *No wonder it took us so 
long to get together. Poor Ami-chan* 

She kept the images up until she could picture meeting Ami in a kiss, 
wrapping her arms around the smaller girl. Smiling she realized that she 
had indeed loved Ami all along. Since that first day she&#39;d seen her, 
blushing face, cradling Luna, beautiful. She&#39;d loved her when Ami had 
tripped in front of her in the alleyway, giving Makoto a perfect view of 
her butt. She&#39;d loved her when they had all died and come back. Loved 
her when they danced together at the ball, loved her when the Starlights 
had come. Loved her when they had died once again, and loved her when 
they were brought back by Usagi once more. She just hadn&#39;t realized what 
that warm feeling had been. Hadn&#39;t known why the sight, why the mere 
mention of the genius&#39;s name had made her heart beat, made her smile. Why 
she always wanted to be near her, why it felt wrong, off, when she 
wasn&#39;t, and why it had felt so right standing at her side. Makoto sank 
into the cushions and stared up at the ceiling. 

*Can this really be happening? Can I really be admitting that I love 
another woman? * She had fought for so long to be more effeminate. 
Learning to cook just to compensate for how strong and tall and ungirly 
she felt. And now she was admitting that she loved a woman? That she 
was, for all practical purposes, a dyke? Still thinking she smiled 
seeing herself hug Ami in her mind. Her height put her at the perfect 
position to cuddle Ami close, to kiss the top of her head lightly. Her 
strength let her pick the blue-haired girl up and twirled her about. That 
more she thought about it the more it seemed as though she was made for 
Ami. * I guess, if she&#39;s my soulmate, I am made for her.* Makoto giggled 
slightly and closed her eyes. * I...I love Ami. I love Ami..... And she 
loves me* Rising to her feet she started to prepare for bed. Tomorrow 
she would go and talk to Setsuna before they all met. Now she could at 
least offer Ami something Kira never could. * Providing we can find her*</pre>
