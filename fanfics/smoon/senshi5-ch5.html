<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 5 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>        The youma looked about them worriedly, advancing slowly into 
the near absolute darkness of the cave system. Some of the others lay 
on the floor of the cavern just behind them, their thick, dark blood 
staining the ground.

        &quot;Is she still in here?&quot; the harsh, grating voice asked the 
others softly.

        &quot;Silence,&quot; the leader growled.

        &quot;Hurk,&quot; the first speaker gasped. They turned to see him 
dangling, a long length of golden chain wrapped around his throat. The 
links came untangled, and the body slumped to the floor, the neck 
cleanly broken.

        &quot;Find her!&quot; the leader howled. He stopped cold suddenly, 
feeling the icy prick of a sharpened blade up against his throat.

        The woman&#39;s voice was silky, dangerous as she said, &quot;Tell your 
masters that their time is coming, and coming very soon. The princess 
gathers up her companions, and I will personally see to it that you 
all pay most dearly.&quot;

        The pressure eased, and the monster staggered away. He turned 
to look at her, the blonde dressed in a pristine sailor fuku, a simple 
white mask covering her face. The terror that hunted them, the nemesis 
of evil... the woman called Sailor V.

        &quot;Remember me,&quot; Sailor V smiled at them, and it was a coldly 
beautiful thing, &quot;because my face will be the last one you see before 
I send you all to hell.&quot; A leap, and she was gone, leaving no trace of 
her presence behind.

        Out in the sunlight, standing by the three young women Makoto 
Kino repeated, &quot;You want to hire me.&quot; A slight smile, &quot;But why should 
I take the job?&quot;

        &quot;Because it&#39;s something worth doing,&quot; Usagi smiled slightly 
and quietly offered, &quot;a fight that will test you to your very limits.&quot;

        Makoto nodded thoughtfully. &#39;Lady knows how to read people,&#39; 
she noted. &quot;Who&#39;s your friends?&quot; she asked softly.

        &quot;Rei Hino,&quot; Usagi gestured to the miko first, who gave Makoto 
a steady, unyielding glance, then to the woman in the suit, &quot;Prof. Ami 
Mizuno.&quot;

        &#39;Guess I was right about her looking like some kind of 
teacher,&#39; Makoto noted even as she said to the two of them, &quot;Nice to 
meet you.&quot; Getting back to business she looked at Usagi, &quot;A good 
fight&#39;s great, but I&#39;ve got to keep a roof overhead. How much can you 
pay me?&quot;

        &quot;I was going to suggest something better than paying you up 
front for monster fighting,&quot; Usagi said, and continued on reluctantly, 
&quot;How would you like to live in my house, rent free?&quot;

        &quot;What?&quot; Rei blurted.

        Rei&#39;s startled reaction brought a slight smile to Makoto&#39;s 
lips. &quot;That&#39;s awfully generous of you,&quot; she said softly, &quot;but what&#39;s 
the catch?&quot;

        &quot;I live alone,&quot; Usagi said softly, &quot;because my family were 
slain by the youma.&quot; There was a silent appeal in her eyes as she 
continued, &quot;It&#39;s why I do this.&quot;

        Makoto felt a pang as she met the girl&#39;s blue eyes with her 
own green ones. She certainly could understand wanting revenge, after 
what happened to her own parents. &quot;All right,&quot; Makoto said to her 
firmly as she offered her hand, &quot;I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Usagi shook the extended hand with a gentle hand.

        Ami pushed her glasses up and took her hand next saying, &quot;It&#39;s 
good to have you with us.&quot; Makoto held onto Ami&#39;s hand for a few 
moments, looking down into her wide eyes, and strangely Ami blushed 
once again.

        With a great deal of reluctance Rei shook as well, &quot;Welcome to 
the team.&quot;

        Ami looked up at Makoto curiously. &quot;You&#39;ve encountered the 
youma before?&quot;

        &quot;Yeah,&quot; Makoto nodded seriously, &quot;they got involved with a 
argument that I was helping some people to handle.&quot;

        &quot;Interesting,&quot; Ami murmured, &quot;Did the youma manifest when you 
became involved, or when Usagi joined the fight?&quot;

        &quot;It went after me,&quot; Makoto admitted. She looked at Ami 
curiously, &quot;What&#39;s your point?&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m not entirely sure,&quot; Ami admitted. &quot;These creatures 
appeared to be aware of us,&quot; she mused, &quot;but didn&#39;t act until now. 
What changed?&quot;

        &quot;Usagi?&quot; Makoto suggested.

        While listening to the two talk Rei drew Usagi aside, &quot;Are you 
sure this is such a good idea?&quot;

        &quot;We need her,&quot; Usagi said softly, &quot;and this is the best way to 
get her help.&quot;

        &quot;But letting her under your roof,&quot; Rei stammered, &quot;what if she 
tries something perverted?&quot;

        The previously silent Luna spoke up at that, &quot;I would 
certainly not allow that.&quot;

        Usagi had went red at that, &quot;You don&#39;t think that she&#39;s..?&quot; 
She shook her head slightly, &quot;Even if she was, Ami would be the one if 
the way that Makoto&#39;s looking at her is any judge.&quot;

        Looking over at Makoto talking with Ami, Rei had to admit 
Usagi had a point. Looking remarkably boyish Makoto was talking to Rei 
cheerfully, and the blue haired girl was soaking up the attention. 
&quot;All right,&quot; Rei admitted, &quot;but be careful, please?&quot;

        Usagi smiled slightly, &quot;Thank you for caring.&quot;

        Rei blushed slightly, &quot;You&#39;re welcome.&quot;

        They walked over to where Makoto and Ami were talking, and the 
amazonian woman looked over at Usagi curiously. &quot;Now that you&#39;ve 
organized this merry little band,&quot; Makoto asked, &quot;what do you want us 
to do?&quot;

        Usagi looked over at Rei, &quot;Do you sense anything?&quot;

        Rei closed her eyes, trying to find a center of stillness as 
she reached out with her perceptions. Oddly, all three of her 
companions registered in her mind&#39;s eye. Usagi glowed golden, Ami was 
like a pool of cool water, and Makoto shone forest green.

        &quot;Nothing,&quot; Rei murmured, &quot;but they might be out of my range.&quot;

        &quot;Then you&#39;re not looking hard enough,&quot; the chill voice said. 
They looked around wildly, finally focusing on a small, white cat 
sitting up on the wall nearby. &quot;Time is running out,&quot; the cat started 
to say, before he was cut off.

        With a feral cry Luna knocked the other cat right off the 
wall, both of their forms blurring as they transformed. &quot;I should kill 
you for your betrayal, Artemis!&quot; Luna hissed, struggling with the 
white haired young man.

        &quot;I&#39;m not a traitor,&quot; Artemis struggled to keep the woman&#39;s 
hands from his throat, &quot;just someone who read the prophecy 
differently, Luna!&quot;

        &quot;Luna,&quot; Usagi cried, &quot;off him!&quot; When the girl refused to obey 
she spoke firmly, &quot;Now!&quot;

        &quot;But Mistress!&quot; Luna looked up at her in horror. Wisely 
Artemis stopped struggling, not giving Luna any more reason to beat on 
him any more.

        &quot;Let him up,&quot; Usagi said softly, and Luna quite reluctantly 
stepped away from him.

        &quot;Thank you, Princess,&quot; Artemis said with a small bow.

        &quot;Call me that again,&quot; Usagi said in a dangerous tone, &quot;and 
I&#39;ll send her back after you. Now what do you want?&quot;

        &quot;The youma are throughout the city,&quot; Artemis dusted himself 
off with as much dignity as he could possibly muster, &quot;seeking to 
gather life force to fully restore their dark masters, the oni. You 
must stop them before they do this, or humanity is doomed.&quot;

        &quot;Restore, not revive?&quot; Luna said disbelievingly, &quot;The oni are 
already awake?&quot;

        &quot;My mistress has faced an oni,&quot; Artemis confirmed, &quot;and barely 
lived to tell the tale.&quot;

        &quot;Wait, who&#39;s your mistress?&quot; Usagi asked, &quot;What did Luna mean, 
betrayal?&quot;

        &quot;I can tell you no more,&quot; Artemis shook his head. With 
startling speed he was up and over the wall, shifting to his cat form 
and disappearing into the night.

        Luna moved to go after him when Usagi said, &quot;No, let him go.&quot; 
She stood there, the sun setting behind them and a grim expression on 
her face, &quot;If he was telling the truth, we have much more important 
things to do.&quot;
