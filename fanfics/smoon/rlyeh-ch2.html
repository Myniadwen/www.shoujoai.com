The Call of Cthulhu, H. P. Lovecraft

------

He didn&#146;t like coming here.

Truth be told, there was nowhere Professor William Dyer would rather not 
be than here, in this waiting room, in this building. It had been 
several years since he was last here to visit his friend Danforth. And 
over a decade since the two were on the doomed Miskatonic Expedition in 
the Antarctic looking for fossils.

&#147;Professor Dyer,&#148; the nurse said as she entered the waiting room, &#147;You 
may come in now.&#148;

William got up wearily and followed the nurse into the psychiatric ward 
where Danforth was being kept. As they walked along the corridors, the 
sounds of manic laughter could be heard coming from some of the rooms 
lining the hallway, as well as the sounds of crying and screaming. 
Between two of the rooms was a window looking outside into a courtyard 
where a group of inmates were frolicking in an enclosed field.

&#147;The lunatic is on the grass,&#148; Dyer muttered.

&#147;What?&#148; the nurse asked.

&#147;Nothing. Just thinking of an old song.&#148;

&#147;Oh, I see. Well, we&#146;re here,&#148; she said, motioning to a door. Through 
the glass window into the room he could see his friend, dressed all in 
white and staring up vacantly at the ceiling.

&#147;I understand you two were friends.&#148;

&#147;Yes. We explored the Arctic wastes together.&#148;

&#147;Really?&#148; the nurse asked, her interest peaked by the statement.

&#147;Hmm&#133; Nurse, has he said anything coherent, anything whatsoever, in the 
last few years?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m sorry, no,&#148; she said as she pulled out a chart, &#147;It all seems to be 
gibberish. He drones on endlessly about &#145;the windowless solids with five 
dimensions,&#146; &#145;the wings,&#146; &#145;the proto-shoggoths&#146; and the like. None of us 
know what to make of his rantings.&#148;

Within his room, staring at the ceiling, Danforth opened his mouth a 
crack.

&#147;The mountains&#133;&#148; he muttered.

&#147;No nurse,&#148; Dyer said uncomfortably outside the room, &#147;I haven&#146;t the 
slightest idea what &#145;the nameless cylinder&#146; or &#145;the primal white jelly&#146; 
might refer to.&#148;

&#147;&#133;of madness,&#148; Danforth finished. He then turned to lay on his side, his 
back to William and the nurse.

As the nurse left him alone momentarily to check up on one of the other 
patients, Dyer went up to the window and looked in at his friend from 
long ago.

&#147;What did you see?&#148; he whispered as he put a hand up to the glass, 
&#147;After all the horror we&#146;d already seen, what greater could you have 
seen when you looked back from the cockpit. What sent you here?&#148;

A few moments later, the nurse returned and led the professor out.

------

&#147;How&#146;s Rei doing?&#148; Artemis asked, noting the concerned look on Minako&#146;s 
face. The blonde looked over to her cat guardian and sighed heavily.

&#147;She either won&#146;t or can&#146;t talk about whatever happened,&#148; the Senshi of 
Love mused, &#147;She&#146;s currently in the shrine staring into that flame of 
hers.&#148;

&#147;I see,&#148; the cat said as he continued to study the leader of the Inner 
Senshi, &#147;And you, how are you doing?&#148;

Minako arched an eyebrow at the question, &#147;What do you mean?&#148;

&#147;You&#146;ve seemed a bit preoccupied with something lately,&#148; the cat said, 
&#147;Care to talk about it?&#148;

Minako considered the question as she slowly started pacing the room. 
Finally, she stopped as she looked outside the window at the shrine 
grounds.

&#147;The future,&#148; she answered, &#147;I&#146;ve been thinking about the future.&#148;

..Meanwhile, at the Chiba Residence..

&#147;The future?&#148; Luna asked.

Usagi nodded her head, &#147;Luna, we stopped aging decades ago. We&#146;ve all 
been preparing for what&#146;s to come in our own ways. But how long? When do 
Mamo-chan and I become king and queen? How much longer before Crystal 
Tokyo becomes a reality? We&#146;ve all sacrificed so much, how much longer?&#148;

Luna tilted her head, &#147;You&#146;ve grown so much from the irresponsible girl 
I once knew,&#148; she sighed nostalgically, &#147;Usagi-chan, I hate to admit 
this, but I have no idea.&#148;

&#133;.

&#147;What do you mean you don&#146;t know?&#148; Minako asked incredulously.

&#147;Mina-chan, try to understand; I don&#146;t know any more than you do about 
what&#146;s to come. If it&#146;s questions about the Silver Millennia, I&#146;m your 
cat. However, as far as Crystal Tokyo goes, we know no more than the 
rest of you. There will be a great peril to the earth, and then somehow 
Crystal Tokyo is born. As to when that&#146;s supposed to happen, however&#133;&#148;

&#133;.

&#147;So, we continue to just sit and wait?&#148; Usagi asked disappointedly.

&#147;I&#146;m afraid so,&#148; Luna said. As her princess stood up from her chair, the 
cat noticed something, &#147;Usagi-chan, you look a bit under the weather. 
Are you okay?&#148;

&#147;I&#146;m fine,&#148; the blonde answered with a smile, &#147;Just a little queasy I 
guess. Mamo-chan fixed some eggs for me this morning, and they didn&#146;t 
quite sit right,&#148; she explained. The cat nodded in understanding as the 
two left the room.

------

Ami yawned as she rubbed a bit at her eyes. As the head of thoracic 
surgery in Fuchu Keijinkai Hospital, she&#146;d had a long day. Besides 
dealing with insurance forms, a pair of worried parents whose child was 
going in for lung problems, and helping to break in a new nurse who 
would be working under her, she&#146;d spent four hours in the operating room 
on an adrenalectomy, the normally simple procedure complicated by an 
undetected blood clot she noticed during the operation.

She entered her office to grab her coat, a smile teasing her lips as she 
thought of tomorrow&#146;s little reunion. She was also thankful for tonight, 
since her four-star chef wife had the day off. Their schedules often 
conflicted, which made times like tonight, when they could both simply 
enjoy each others company, all the sweeter to the blue-haired woman.

As she was about to leave her office, she heard a beep coming from her 
computer alerting her she had mail. Out of curiosity, she decided to see 
who it was from.

&#147;Professor Angell?&#148; she asked in astonishment. She hadn&#146;t heard from the 
American in decades. The message was marked as being urgent, too. She 
was about to click on the message, when she stopped herself; she&#146;d just 
worked a twelve-hour shift, and was exhausted. Even if the message truly 
was urgent, she doubted she&#146;d be able to give it the necessary attention 
it deserved.

&#147;Tomorrow,&#148; she muttered as she turned the computer off. She left her 
office, grabbed a hot coffee from a vending machine, and left the 
hospital.

------

Kihomi looked out at the ocean, noting the way the colors danced across 
the waves as the sun slowly set. She loved it out here on the beach, 
lounging on the towel spread out underneath her. There were few tourists 
out in the Hawaii islands this time of year, giving a sense of privacy 
to the part of the beach she and her soul mate were spending their time 
on.

As she stared out, watching a group of seagulls fly overhead and a 
sailboat gently glide by, someone sat down next to her and ran a hand 
over her shoulders. She turned and smile as her grey eyes met Setsuna&#146;s 
violet ones.

They kissed, both closing their eyes as they savored the moment. After 
several moments, they separated and Setsuna joined Kihomi in looking out 
at the beautiful scene before her.

&#147;It&#146;s beautiful,&#148; she whispered.

&#147;Mmm&#133;&#148; Kihomi answered with a smile, &#147;And so is the scenery,&#148; she joked. 
Both women laughed warmly for a bit before the teacher added, &#147;I think I 
understand now why Michi-chan loves the sea so much.&#148;

&#147;Michi-chan,&#148; Setsuna said fondly, &#147;Wonder what she&#146;s doing right now.&#148;

&#147;Well, since you and I are on our anniversary, and she&#146;s been cooped up 
in that big house alone while Ruka&#146;s been racing in Italy, I&#146;m guessing 
she&#146;s probably waiting eagerly by the door for the big blonde goof to 
come home.&#148;

&#147;He, he&#133; You and Ruka,&#148; the Time Senshi chuckled, &#147;Still, you&#146;re 
probably right. She&#146;s probably been bored to tears left all alone,&#148; she 
said as she lay on the towel next to her wife. The two lay silently 
together as they continued to watch the sun slowly descend over the 
horizon.

------

Michiru looked through bloodshot eyes at the two women leading her 
through the mansion, away from the prison she&#146;d been sucked into in the 
studio, and away from the horrible image. As she looked first to the 
blonde at her left, then to the emaciated woman with midnight black hair 
dressed in orange Tibetan robes to her right, she became puzzled; she 
knew the Buddhist from somewhere, but where? The blonde to her left was 
saying something in a frantic, almost angry voice, while the other woman 
was answering in low mutterings. In her current state, she wasn&#146;t sure 
what was happening. She had a tenuous grasp on sanity, and was fighting 
with her last remaining strength to retain it.

Slowly, she brought herself around enough to focus on the words passing 
around her.

&#147;&#133;you! Damn you for running away and damn you for hiding all these years 
and damn you for coming home now like this!&#148;

Michiru looked from the blonde to the other woman, who said something 
incoherent to her. As a light was switched on in the bathroom, the 
blonde snapped back at her.

&#147;&#133;do you mean calm down? I come home to find Michi-chan delirious and 
looking like a Picasso painting, and then you showed up out of the blue 
and&#133;&#148;

&#147;Pumice soap,&#148; the quiet one responded.

&#147;What?&#148;

&#147;Papa, things may have changed but certain things stay constant, like 
your love of cars and working on engines. I&#146;ll stay with Michiru-mama; 
you go into the garage and get the pumice soap you use for cleaning oil 
and grease off your hands.&#148;

A moment of silence followed, then &#147;O&#133; Okay,&#148; the blonde said, her voice 
much more subdued. She then left Michiru alone with the black-haired 
woman.

&#147;Michiru-mama, if you can hear me, I&#146;m going to take you into the shower 
now. Please trust me.&#148;

The artist looked at the woman like a deer caught in headlights, her sad 
blue eyes causing the woman in the robes to look away briefly as she 
wiped something from her eyes. She then watched her turn the water on in 
the bathtub, and adjust it to the right temperature. She gently took 
Michiru&#146;s bright green hand and led her over to the bathtub as the 
blonde re-entered the room carrying something.

&#147;Here; I&#146;ve got the cream soap and the solid bar.&#148;

&#147;Good,&#148; the quiet one said as she got the artist into the bathtub, &#147;Call 
the others,&#148; she said as she stepped into the bathtub behind Michiru, 
&#147;Tell them all we&#146;re all in great danger. Something terrible is about to 
happen,&#148; she said as she closed the curtain.

Unseen by Michiru, the blonde left the room. The dark-haired woman in 
the orange robes turned a handle, and the overhead shower came on.

&#147;Papa should really be doing this,&#148; Michiru heard her mutter as she was 
ushered in underneath the warm water. As the Buddhist&#146;s robes quickly 
became soaked, she took some sort of orange-smelling goop and began 
working it into the artist&#146;s wet and filthy hair. As the fingers 
scrubbed at her scalp, the artist felt herself begin to weep once again.

&#147;Shhh&#133;&#148; the woman gently said from behind, &#147;Don&#146;t cry Michiru-mama,&#148; she 
said as she took the removable showerhead and began to rinse the 
artist&#146;s hair. Michiru then heard a very strange sound coming from 
behind her. It sounded like a song&#133; No, not a song; a chant. The same 
phrase being recited over and over again, in a voice deeper and more 
powerful than the artist would&#146;ve guessed the frail-looking woman 
capable of. Somehow, the rhythm and the repetition began to have a 
calming effect on her, and as she felt a bar of rough soap being 
scrubbed against her back, a name came to her. It was a name from long 
ago, a name that brought feelings of love and pain, affection and 
sadness, all at once.

&#147;Hotaru,&#148; she whispered, her voice drowned out by the shower and the 
Tibetan chant.

------

Ami sipped absent-mindedly from her coffee mug as she pulled her car 
into the driveway. She parked the vehicle, got out, and went to the 
front door, smiling as she thought of the nice, relaxing evening she was 
hoping to have with her wife.

Opening the door, she was in for a surprise.

The living room was romantically lit with candles, and on the dining 
room table was a bowl of chocolate covered strawberries. As she took her 
shoes off and came further into the room, she heard a voice call out to 
her.

&#147;Darling? Is that you?&#148;

Ami turned to the kitchen where her Mako-chan&#146;s voice had come from, and 
felt her eyes widen as she saw her wife in a form-fitting French maid 
outfit, complete with plunging neckline and plenty of leg showing. A 
goofy grin appeared on the doctor&#146;s face as her eyes wandered from the 
taller woman&#146;s chest down to her dark stockings and black high heels.

&#147;M&#133; Mako-chan?&#148; Ami stuttered out as she felt the temperature in the 
room rise, &#147;Wha&#133;&#148;

&#147;Happy birthday, m&#146;love,&#148; the chef purred as she picked up one of the 
chocolates and began to saunter over to the shorter woman.

&#147;Birthday?&#148; Ami began, &#147;But that&#146;s not for another two&#133;&#148; she was cut off 
as Makoto placed the sweet in her mouth.

&#147;I know,&#148; the chef answered affectionately as she stroked the doctor&#146;s 
cheek, &#147;But we&#146;ll both be busy on your birthday, love. And tomorrow 
we&#146;ll be at Usagi-chan&#146;s, which means we&#146;re celebrating your birthday 
tonight,&#148; she explained as she led Ami over to the couch and made her 
sit, &#147;And for your birthday tonight, you&#146;re the mistress of the house. 
And I&#146;m your humble servant, to do with as you wish.&#148;

Ami&#146;s eyebrow arched up a bit at that. Before she could respond however, 
Makoto brought the tired doctor&#146;s feet up to her lap and began massaging 
them. She bent over, making sure her wife got a good look at her 
cleavage as she kissed the top of the doctor&#146;s right foot. Ami let out a 
soft moan as the chef&#146;s hands slowly began rubbing up her ankle, up her 
calf, past her knee and under her skirt.

Ami pulled her wife to her and kissed her, the two women exploring each 
other&#146;s mouths with their tongues as Makoto&#146;s hands continued to slide 
up the smaller woman&#146;s inner thigh.

&#147;Have I told you lately how much I love you?&#148; Ami whispered sweetly as 
she pulled back from the kiss.

&#147;Of course,&#148; Makoto answered as she started to slip her fingers beneath 
her wife&#146;s panties, &#147;But I never tire of hearing it.&#148;

RING!

Both Ami and Makoto looked up with disappointed looks.

&#147;That&#133; that was the Senshi communicator,&#148; the doctor said sadly, her 
face still flushed.

&#147;I guess we should answer it then,&#148; Makoto sighed.

RING!

The chef got up off of Ami and answered her communicator, &#147;Mako here, I&#133; 
Ruka? Ruka, calm down, you&#146;re talking too fast for me to&#133; What?.. WHAT? 
Okay, stay calm. We&#146;ll be right over.&#148;

&#147;Mako-chan? Mako-chan, what&#146;s wrong?&#148;

&#147;We have to go to the Outers&#146; mansion,&#148; Makoto answered, anxiety evident 
in her voice, &#147;Now!&#148;

------

Haruka finished calling the last of her fellow Senshi, and set her 
communicator down with shaking hands. She started up the stairs, trying 
to calm down as best she could as she could hear the shower going and 
what sounded like a low droning chant coming from behind the bathroom 
door. She was about to reach for the door handle when she stopped. 
Closing her eyes, she felt the warm tears begin to travel down her 
cheeks. She put a hand up against the door to steady herself as she 
brought the other one up to her eyes.

It was then that the timegate appeared, and her fellow Outers emerged.

Setsuna went over to the blonde and pulled her into a hug. Haruka 
initially tensed, but soon found herself returning the embrace.

&#147;Damn it,&#148; the racer said angrily, &#147;I&#146;m supposed to be the strong one.&#148;

Setsuna said nothing as she held her friend. Kihomi heard the sounds 
from inside the bathroom and noticed the set of paint-stained footprints 
leading from downstairs into the closed room when she and the others 
heard the sound of tires squealing, followed by the front door opening 
rapidly and footsteps racing towards them.

&#147;Ruka!&#148; Mamoru called out breathlessly as he reached the group first, 
followed closely by Usagi and Luna.

&#147;We&#146;re here,&#148; the blonde in her trademark odangos said, placing a 
comforting hand on Haruka&#146;s shoulder. The racer smiled at her princess 
sadly; even now, even in the middle of this crisis, Usagi had the power 
to lift her spirits.

The shower and the low chanting in the other room ceased. A few anxious 
moments later, the door opened. Michiru was wearing a white bathrobe, 
the paint cleaned off most of her but still staining her wet hair and 
under her nails. Behind her stood Hotaru, her wet hair hanging like a 
curtain over her face. The wet Tibetan robes clung to her body, 
revealing to the onlookers just how thin the Senshi of Death had become.

&#147;She needs sleep,&#148; Hotaru said as she swept the wet black locks back 
away from her face and focused her sunken eyes on her Haruka-papa, &#147;I&#146;ve 
washed as much as I could off her. Take her to bed, and try to make her 
as comfortable as possible.&#148;

As Setsuna went with Haruka and Michiru, the youngest of the Senshi 
looked to the three remaining people in the hallway with her and smiled 
weakly.

&#147;So,&#148; she quipped, &#147;Anything happen while I was gone?&#148;

An awkward silence followed as the four stood uncomfortably in the 
hallway, a growing puddle of water forming under the Senshi of Death and 
her wet robes. Hotaru was waiting for it; the yelling, the angry tones. 
She knew they&#146;d be furious at her for running away like she did after 
the incident, and was trying to steal herself for what was to come.

Finally, Kihomi stepped forward.

&#147;You&#133; look hungry,&#148; she said as she broke the silence, &#147;Do you feel up 
to eating something?&#148;

Hotaru was taken aback a bit, &#147;But&#133; Aren&#146;t you mad at me?&#148; she asked as 
she looked from the teacher to her princess and Mamoru.

Kihomi answered her by wrapping her arms around her. Hotaru closed her 
eyes as she rested her head on her obi-san&#146;s shoulder. Usagi came up and 
joined in the hug.

&#147;Yes, we&#146;re upset,&#148; Kihomi answered, her own clothes now wet from 
hugging Hotaru, &#147;You left us a note in the middle of the night and 
disappeared. I know you were hurting, but we were all hurting 
Taru-chan.&#148;

Tears began to form at the corners of Hotaru&#146;s eyes, &#147;He was only a 
child,&#148; she whispered, &#147;He was only nine years old, and I&#133; I&#133;&#148;

&#147;He&#146;d been turned into a youma,&#148; Usagi said as she stroked the younger 
Senshi&#146;s cheek, &#147;He was about to attack me. You did what you felt you 
had to at the time.&#148;

&#147;Try telling that to the media,&#148; she said resentfully, &#147;Try being 
labeled a menace and a public danger. Or try telling that to his mom. I 
can still remember her pointing her finger at me, screaming &#145;murderer&#146;&#133;&#148;

Mamoru crossed his arms as he looked at Hotaru, &#147;So you needed 
distance,&#148; he said, &#147;From the looks of things, you were busy trying to 
find yourself. Now that you&#146;ve returned, I take it your journey is over. 
What did you find?&#148;

Hotaru looked at her future king silently for a few seconds as she 
pondered the question.

&#147;Emptiness,&#148; she answered, &#147;No enlightenment, no fulfillment, just the 
emptiness of a coward running away from her past,&#148; after a few seconds, 
she added, &#147;And loneliness.&#148;

Kihomi tilted the Senshi of Death&#146;s head up, and kissed her gently on 
the forehead, &#147;Come on,&#148; she said as Usagi backed away, &#147;Let&#146;s all go 
downstairs. We can talk more down in the kitchen. You need some food,&#148; 
she added as Hotaru&#146;s stomach growled.

Rodger McGovern strode into the meeting room, a briefcase in his hand 
and his strong figure showing through the grey flannel business suit he 
wore. The gray-haired man was one of the wealthiest men in the world, 
and one of the most admired. His charitable organizations and 
philanthropic pursuits were all well known in the international 
community.

They also acted as a perfect front.

In the room standing around a large meeting table were a blonde woman 
wearing sunglasses and a tailored coat over her suit, an African man in 
a suit with a scar running up his cheek, and a middle-aged woman in a 
long black dress and glasses holding a file folder overflowing with 
papers. As McGovern took his seat, the others followed suit.

&#147;Well?&#148; Rodger asked as he focused on the older woman. She immediately 
pulled out a collection of news clippings and astronomical charts.

&#147;The few isolated cases of madness have turned into a torrent,&#148; she 
said, a smile spreading across her face, &#147;Which only goes to confirm 
what the national observatory, NASA, and my own observations have 
pointed to.&#148;

&#147;When the stars come round again,&#148; the African said, a heavy accent 
hinting at his Nigerian nationality, &#147;Then the liberated Old Ones will 
teach us new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy ourselves, and 
all the earth will flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom.&#148;

&#147;Yes, thank you,&#148; McGovern said with a grin, &#147;We are all well aware of 
the prophesies; it&#146;s what comes after the cosmic rave party from hell 
that we are interested in,&#148; he pointed out. Turning to his left, he 
looked intently at the blonde in the sunglasses, &#147;How did it go Maria?&#148;

&#147;The problem has been eliminated for the moment,&#148; she answered in a 
Hispanic accent, quickly adding, &#147;Although I feel I should point out 
that once the insanity begins to spread beyond those with acutely 
sensitive psyches such as artist and seers, it will be harder to keep 
outsiders from connecting the dots,&#148; she said, leaving out the part 
about the professor sending out any sort of computer message.

&#147;Maybe,&#148; Rodger answered sardonically, &#147;But by the time anyone can make 
the connections it&#146;ll be too late. Now then,&#148; he said as he opened his 
briefcase, &#147;Let&#146;s get down to business, shall we?&#148;

------

Minako sighed as she drove the car into the Outer&#146;s driveway. Just as 
the blonde was turning off the ignition the radio station she was 
listening to, an oldies station, began to play one of her songs from her 
youth as a teen idol. She looked worriedly over to Rei; the Shinto 
priestess hadn&#146;t said a word to her since this morning when she begged 
her to hold her. After the call from Haruka, she went to the sacred 
flame and found Rei staring intently into the fire, not even 
acknowledging her presence. She basically had to drag the woman away and 
into the car.

As Minako exited her side of the car, another car pulled up. She opened 
Rei&#146;s door and pulled her out as Ami and Makoto exited their car and 
came over.

&#147;Mina-chan, Rei-chan,&#148; Makoto said excitedly as they ran over. Minako 
noted that Mako was wearing a large green sweater over something rather 
skimpy underneath, and cracked a smile as she noticed the tall woman&#146;s 
black stockings and heels.

&#147;So,&#148; she asked, &#147;I take it Ruka-kun called you when you two were in the 
middle of something?&#148;

Both Makoto and Ami blushed. The doctor found her voice first, &#147;We&#146;d 
better get inside; maybe Rei will be able to sense something and&#133; 
Rei-chan?&#148; she asked quizzically as she looked behind Minako. The blonde 
turned to see her love far ahead of her and the others as the priestess 
opened the door to the Outer&#146;s mansion.

&#147;Hey!&#148; Mina yelled as she and the others followed, &#147;Wait up!&#148;

Rei either didn&#146;t hear her beloved&#146;s admonition or didn&#146;t care as she 
strode into the house, not bothering to remove her shoes. As she walked 
through the living room towards a side room, she could hear voices 
coming from the kitchen.

&#147;&#133;mama is sleeping soundly in bed. I&#146;m&#133; Sorry I spoke angrily to you 
firefly, it&#146;s&#133; It&#146;s just&#133;&#148;

&#147;Papa,&#148; a sad voice said, &#147;Papa, don&#146;t cry.&#148;

&#147;Tell you what,&#148; a third voice said, &#147;Let&#146;s get you out of those wet 
clothes before you catch a cold. We should have something dry for you to 
slip into up in my room. Of course, it&#146;ll be a bit big for you&#133;&#148;

&#147;I&#146;ll come with you,&#148; a voice cheerfully offered as Rei now walked past 
the kitchen door.

&#147;Thank you Usagi-chan, I&#133; Rei-chan?&#148; Setsuna asked as she caught a 
glimpse of the priestess walking past them back towards the door that 
led into the studio.

&#147;Rei-chan!&#148; Minako shouted as she now came into the house with Makoto 
and Ami. Kicking her shoes off quickly she ran over to the Priestess who 
was now standing before the door, her hand resting on the hard wood 
doorframe as she looked in at the painting through the glass window of 
the door. Her bizarre behavior alerted the others that something was 
seriously wrong.

&#147;Rei?&#148; Usagi asked as she came up behind the raven-haired woman. She 
placed a hand on her shoulder, &#147;What&#146;s wrong Rei? Do you sense some sort 
of menace or&#133;&#148;

Usagi&#146;s voice sounded to Rei like it was coming to her from out of a 
cave, echoing off walls and reverberating in her ears. Then she felt the 
room grow dark. She was alone, no light, just her and the painting she 
was somehow able to still see in the heavy darkness of the Outer&#146;s 
mansion.

&#147;R&#146;lyeh,&#148; the Fire Senshi whispered, staring straight ahead at Michiru&#146;s 
painting. She didn&#146;t understand why she said it, or what it meant. She 
narrowed her eyes as she continued to stare intensely at the painting, 
blue and red dots suddenly appearing before the image.

Usagi cocked her head to one side, not understanding what her old friend 
meant. She looked back to the others and shook her head before turning 
back to the priestess.

&#147;Rei-chan,&#148; she asked as Mamoru came over to her and Minako, &#147;I don&#146;t 
understand, what do you mean?&#148;

&#147;R&#146;lyeh&#133;&#148; Rei repeated, the word echoing over and over in her mind as 
the dots continued their dance and the thing in the art studio continued 
to look at her emotionlessly. Mamoru looked inquiringly over to her as 
Minako came closer.

&#147;Rei love, what is it?&#148; Minako asked, sensing something was very wrong 
indeed with her beloved.

&#147;Rei-chan?&#148; the future king asked, &#147;What&#133;&#148;

She could sense it; a menace. A new and terrible menace had appeared. 
She began to feel short of breath as she gasped for air.

&#147;Cthulhu,&#148; Rei said, her voice now loud enough for the other Senshi in 
the room to hear her, &#147;Cthulhu.&#148;

&#147;K&#133; Klul&#133; Rei-chan, what are you talking about?&#148; Minako asked, a sudden 
unaccountable dread building up in her and the others.

She didn&#146;t know what the new word meant either, but it seemed to surge 
through her like a bolt of electricity as she said it, thrilling and 
arousing and terrifying her all at once.

&#147;Rei-chan,&#148; Usagi said apprehensively.

As bright flashes of green light joined the blue and red dots in their 
concentric dance before the painting, she realized it; the image was 
calling to her. Her throat felt like it was constricting as an unknown 
terror now filled the Fire Senshi.

&#147;Rei-chan, what are you trying to tell us?&#148; Mamoru asked.

In answer to Mamoru&#146;s question, Rei let out a sudden blood-curdling 
scream as she threw herself forward, smashing her forehead through the 
glass.

&#147;REI!&#148;

&#147;Oh my god!&#148;

As she could feel hands frantically reaching for her, she looked up once 
again at the painting. Blood ran down her face as jagged pieces of glass 
stuck out from her forehead.

&#147;Cthulhu!&#148; she screamed, her eyes bulging as they met the red, merciless 
eyes of the painting, &#147;Cthulhu!&#148;

-To Be Continued-

End Notes: Okay, as if the fact that there&#146;s a tenth Senshi and the 
future Sailor Jupiter has a bionic arm hasn&#146;t alerted you yet, yes, this 
is an AU. I&#146;m stating this because in this story Crystal Tokyo is 
founded in 2043, whereas in the original manga and anime the incidents 
would&#146;ve been closer to 2000-2003. I hope this doesn&#146;t annoy too many of 
you. It&#146;s my own fault; in Rules of Engagement I mentioned 3043 as being 
the millennial year of Crystal Tokyo (poor research on my fault). 
Anyways, thanks for all the reviews so far, and I hope you like this 
series as much as its two predecessors.</pre>
