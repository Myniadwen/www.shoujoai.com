<h1>Makoto's Angel (part 5 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jwelch.html">Jessica Welch</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makang-ch4.html">Back to Part 4</a><pre>The next morning Minako was woken up by Artemis pawing at her and
calling her name softly. It took awhile but she was soon pulled out of
sleep. She sat up and groggily asked what was the matter and was about
to lay down again. She in truth only slept about two or three hours.
&quot;Makoto is waking up so yo-hey!&quot; Artemis was knocked aside in
mid-sentence as Minako bolted up and ran, stumbling, into Makoto&#39;s
room.

Makoto was just pushing herself into a sitting position trying to
ignore the massive pounding inside her brain. Minako was there in not
time flat helping her sit up and moving the pillow behind her back. She
looked expectantly into Makoto&#39;s eyes wanting to see if she was ok.
&quot;Thanks Mina-chan,&quot; she sat back and lifted her hand to the lump behind
her ear and gently probed it with her finger tips. Wincing slightly she
opened her eyes to find Minako staring at her intently. &#39;That&#39;s a sight
to be woken up to,&#39; She thought to herself and smiled a little. &quot;How
long have I been out?&quot; she squinted looking out the window seeing it
was well into morning.

&quot;Three days,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;Is there anything I can get for you? I
know you must have the more horrible headache. Do you want some
aspirin?&quot; Makoto closed her eyes and nodded a little. She felt like
she&#39;d been hit by a bus. Minako came back in with some aspirin and a
glass of water.

&quot;Thanks Mina-chan. You don&#39;t have to go through all this trouble
though.. I&#39;m sure I can mana-&quot;

&quot;Now I don&#39;t want to hear any of that. I know you&#39;re trying to be all
tuff and strong when you really feel as weak as a kitten. We&#39;ve been
friends long enough for me to see through that act. Now you don&#39;t have
to...&quot; she paused willing herself not to look at the nightstand where
the necklace was. &quot;...to pretend anymore,&quot; she finished quietly.

Makoto was still much to groggy to catch the underlying meaning in
Minako&#39;s words. She was also too weak to put up much of a fight. She
sagged back into her pillow against the head board and closed her eyes
again trying to absorb everything into her brain gently. She felt like
if she tried to think she would shatter into a million little Makoto
pieces. She just wanted to soak in everything without using energy to
gather it herself. It felt good to just relax and be a little bit less
than superhuman for awhile. &quot;So tell me what&#39;s been going on since I&#39;ve
been knocked out.&quot; She smiled and joked, &quot;I don&#39;t know how much longer
I can keep up this dependant act.&quot;

Minako smiled back and continued with the sarcasm. &quot;I&#39;m sure you can
find the strength to survive a few more days with it. The real
challenge is putting up with me.&quot; A plan had started to form in
Minako&#39;s head on how she was going to handle the new situation she
found herself in with Makoto. The smoky ideas started to swirl together
in her head and the fog started to take shape. &quot;Let me think-&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t hurt yourself, You want a helmet before you begin?&quot; Makoto
teased.

&quot;Oh ha ha. You&#39;re so funny Mako-chan.&quot; Minako narrowed her eyes in mock
anger. &quot;Anyway, about the past three days... I don&#39;t think anything
major has happened. All of us have been too worried about you to do
anything else. No big world events have happened. No local events
either. No more youma...&quot; she trailed off for a moment remembering how
close Makoto had come to meeting the end of her destiny. She swallowed
and tried to gain control of her emotions. She thought she was going to
break down again when she felt a gentle touch on her hand.

&quot;I&#39;m alright now Mina-chan. No worries. I&#39;m just glad you&#39;re safe.&quot;
Mina nodded and gave a small smile. &quot;Do you want to talk about it. From
the look of it,&quot; Makoto grinned and gestured to Minako&#39;s mussed hair,
&quot;you&#39;ve been through a bit of hell yourself.&quot;

Minako self-consciously tried to smooth down her hair and arrange her
clothes. She heard Makoto chuckle and a blush spread across her face.
Looking up she laughed too. &quot;I guess I shouldn&#39;t bother huh? Do I
really look that bad though?&quot;

Makoto smiled softly. &quot;No, you just look like you haven&#39;t gotten much
sleep. You&#39;re still the beautiful Minako you always are. I&#39;m sure all
the boys would still line up to ask you out,&quot; she added. &quot;Now you want
to tell me why you haven&#39;t gotten very much sleep?&quot; The concern she had
for the blonde was very evident in her eyes.

&quot;Now see, you&#39;re doing it again Mako-chan. You&#39;ve just woken up from
being unconscious for three nights and already you&#39;re trying to take
care of me when you should be relaxing and worrying about yourself.&quot;

&quot;And your point?&quot;

&quot;My point is it time to take care of you. I can wait since I can tell
you won&#39;t let it go. Well talk about it after you&#39;ve recovered a bit
more. You can&#39;t tell me your headache is gone already.&quot;

&quot;Well I could tell you that.&quot;

&quot;But it wouldn&#39;t be the truth Mako-chan, so don&#39;t even try it.&quot; Makoto
relented and grumbled about something under her breath. Minako didn&#39;t
catch what she said but decided to leave it. She didn&#39;t want to argue
with the brunette, even if it was harmless, good-natured bickering.
&quot;You just let me take care of you for a change.&quot; Before Makoto could
voice another protest Minako cut in, &quot;You&#39;ll just have to suck it up
and bear the pampering you&#39;re going to receive. I think I know just the
thing that will make you feel better.&quot; She got up and spun around
leaving Makoto to stare after her dumbly.

The throbbing in her head had started to diminish thanks to the aspirin
but her body still felt like it had been used as a punching bag.
Something seemed a bit different with Minako but she could quite place
it. She shrugged it off thinking the injury must have juggled her brain
more than she originally thought. She decided that she would let Minako
baby her, not that she had much choice. She just liked to pretend she
was in control. She couldn&#39;t complain though, She had Minako all to
herself for awhile. The nicest thing was having her near. She smiled as
she thought how quickly she would probably recuperate with Minako&#39;s
presence. She couldn&#39;t help but feel better when her angel was around.
She sighed softly and closed her eyes waiting for her return.

Minako came back in a few minutes later and sat on the bed beside her
friend. &quot;Mako-chan... you awake?&quot; she whispered softly. Makoto opened
her eyes and nodded. &quot;Good. I have everything ready. Think you have
enough strength to stand? I&#39;ll be here to help you so no worries.&quot;

Makoto nodded and gave her a questioning look. Minako stood and pulled
the covers back. Makoto was in a pair of green cotton boxers and a
button down pajama top. Her hair had been put in a loose braid so the
cold compress could be applied without her hair getting tangled. She
wondered briefly who had changed her clothes and done her hair but
quickly let it go. It wasn&#39;t that important, plus it would be too
dangerous to think of Minako- well she just wouldn&#39;t think about it.
She took a deep breath and slowly swung her legs over the edge of the
bed. With her feet firmly on her carpeted floor she let the breath out.
That wasn&#39;t as bad as she expected. She still had some motor skills.
Taking another deep breath she started to push herself off the bed. She
clenched her teeth and she felt every muscle stretch painfully. Minako
had an arm around her waist instantly and draped Makoto&#39;s arm over her
shoulder helping her stand. &#39;If I wasn&#39;t in so much pain I&#39;d really be
enjoying this,&#39; Makoto thought to herself. &quot;So you got me standing, now
where are we going to go?&quot;

&quot;To the bathroom. I figured a good long soak in a hot tub would make
you feel better.&quot; She could also do any other &quot;business&quot; without being
embarrassed by asking for help to washroom.

Makoto smiled gratefully and they made their way slowly to the
restroom. Once there Makoto looked around and saw the soft light of a
few glowing candles. The bath had bubbles in it and smelled like
strawberries. &quot;Oh Minako you didn&#39;t have to do all this.&quot;

&quot;Yes I did. The bright florescent light in here would hurt your eyes,
that&#39;s why I lit the candles. And you&#39;ll find out why the bubbles are
needed later. Now can you handle getting into the tub on your own.
You&#39;re not going to slip and give yourself another egg sized lump
behind your other ear are you?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Makoto chuckled, &quot;I think I can handle it from here. She put her
hands on the sink for support and Minako ducked out from under her arm,

&quot;Now don&#39;t wash your hair. Just soak for as long as you need and call
me back in when you&#39;re ready to do that.&quot; Makoto gave her a look that
clearly asked why she had to call her back in. &quot;The braid has a few
knots in it that you won&#39;t be able to get out without pulling your
hair, and that is just going to cause unnecessary pain. So I&#39;ll take it
out for you when you&#39;re ready.&quot; Without another word she turned and
left Makoto standing in the bathroom with an uncertain look.

Makoto had been soaking in the bath for at least half an hour. She was
grateful that the PJ top was button down. She doubted she had the
balance to pull anything over her head. The bath felt wonderful on her
sore body. The water was beginning to cool, she figured she should call
Minako back in to untangle her hair. She looked at the bubbles which we
almost completely gone. &#39;This won&#39;t do, but at least I know what their
purpose was. Oh well, more water will fix two things at once.&#39; She ran
more hot water and added more bubble bath. With a little help by
splashing the water with her hands the bubbles came back to life and
covered the surface. With a satisfied grin Makoto called Minako back
in.

Minako entered and for the twentieth time asked herself what in the
hell she was doing. &quot;You ready?&quot; she asked and placed a set of fresh
clothes on the sink counter. Makoto was already sitting up in the
middle of the bath with her knees hugged to her chest modestly. She
nodded and Minako knelt next to the tub. She carefully began unraveling
the braid making sure she didn&#39;t pull her hair. Her fingers worked
gently untangling the few knots that plagued the soft brown locks.
Makoto felt like she was going to doze off at any moment. It was so
soothing to feel Minako&#39;s fingers funning through her hair. &quot;You ready
for me to wash it?&quot; Minako asked softly.

Makoto&#39;s eyes snapped open. &quot;You&#39;re going to wash it? Can&#39;t I do it
myself?&quot; she asked nervously.

&quot;Well you could try but then you&#39;d have to lay back in the water to wet
it down and it would get all tangled. Then you would have to sit back
up to shampoo it and it would become a bigger mass of knots and
tangles. Think about laying back again and trying to rinse it. You know
you would pull it and the pain that would cause to the bump behind your
ear.&quot; Minako rationalized. &quot;It would be a lot easier if I did it. All
you have to do it sit there while I pour water over your head.&quot; She
noticed the blush creeping up the back of Makoto&#39;s neck. &quot;Oh Mako-chan
I&#39;ve already proven myself not to peek at anything when I gave you that
back rub. You might as well just relax and enjoy the attention. No
offence but your hair must be a pain to wash with how thick it is.
Don&#39;t your arms get sore?&quot; Minako giggled trying to lighten the tension
that was in the small room.

&quot;Well it is a pain but I&#39;m used to it so really-&quot;

&quot;Close your eyes and hold your breath Mako-chan.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot; At the same time she asked she heard the sound of water filling
a very large container behind her and knew what was going to happen.
She quickly did as she was told tilting her head back. A moment later
warm water was pouring gently over her head wetting down her dark
tresses. It took two more times before all of it was drenched. Minako
was sitting on the edge of the tub now behind Makoto. She grabbed the
shampoo and squeezed a generous amount into her palm. She rubbed her
hands together before placing them on the top of Makoto&#39;s head. Slowly
she began to build a lather by lightly scrubbing Makoto&#39;s scalp.

Makoto was in heaven. Her whole body turned into a relaxed pile of goo.
Minako&#39;s fingers slowly worked through her hair, her touch very
delicate, especially around the wound. &#39;If only I could get this kind
of treatment all the time. This combined with those magical massages.
Whoever Mina-chan marries is going to be very lucky indeed. I should be
happy I&#39;m experiencing it at all. Yeah, I can have this in my dreams
any night I want. Just as I&#39;ve done for the past few months.&#39; She felt
herself drifting off again into one of those dreams where Minako loved
her in the same way.

&quot;Ok Mako-chan, close your eyes and hold your breath. It&#39;s time to rinse
again.&quot; Makoto came out of her fantasy and titled her head back. Minako
poured with one hand while combing her fingers through the dark locks
making sure it didn&#39;t tangle. She had to repeat this process four times
but finally her thick mane was rinsed completely. &quot;There are clothes on
the sink. You think you&#39;re up to having some soup?&quot;

&quot;Um sure, that sounds great.&quot;

&quot;Good. You&#39;re getting better, you didn&#39;t try to argue this time. Let&#39;s
see if we can keep it like that.&quot; Minako laughed and moved quickly out
of the bathroom.

Makoto lay back in the tub and just stared at the faucet by her feet.
&#39;She really being extra nice to me. I hope she doesn&#39;t feel guilty
about me taking that blow for her. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
Thank goodness I got there in time. I don&#39;t know what I would have done
if she had gotten hurt.&#39;

Makoto decided not to think about it and got out of the bath. Once she
was dried and changed she found Minako in the kitchen. Makoto had
pulled her hair back in to a loose pony tail at the nape of her neck.
She felt completely revitalized from the bath. Her head still hurt and
she still felt like she didn&#39;t have much strength but at least her body
didn&#39;t feel like it&#39;d been stomped on by an elephant. She knew her
strength would probably start to return once she ate.

Minako filled two bowls with chicken noodle soup. She grabbed some
saltine crackers and set them on the table before bringing the steaming
soup over. As she sat she peeked at Makoto through her bangs
undetected. Makoto&#39;s head was tilted downward as if she was looking at
her soup, but Minako saw how her green eyes followed her movements. &#39;I
wonder how often she does things that?&#39; Mina thought to herself.
