<h1>Absence (part 1 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;RARRRRRNOOOOOOO!!&quot; screamed the youma in a bestial howl of mixed 
disbelief and rage while it collapsed heavily to its knees. &quot;I cannot be 
defeated yet! Not by the likes of *you*!!&quot;

Sailor Mars dropped her outstretched hands to her sides as lingering 
wisps of smoke wafted off of the tips of her two index fingers. The Fire 
Senshi, protectively positioned behind a toppled shelf, had just 
launched a fireball at the bellowing creature from where she crouched a 
short distance away from it. It was about time the youma fell in the 
miko&#39;s opinion; it had seemed like it would never go down despite the 
barrage of attacks she and her fellow Sailor Senshi had pummelled its 
body with.

The evil creature had been spotted, of all places, breaking into a 
fashionable clothing store that had closed for the night... for exactly 
what reason; Mars had no idea. It had been sheer luck that the five 
Inner Sailor Senshi had been nearby. Minako had insisted on dragging the 
group to see a late night screening of the latest Sailor V movie and 
they were en route to their homes when the incident occurred. Naturally, 
the Sailor Senshi had immediately sprung into action, the girls all 
pulling their Henshin pens out and transforming into their well-known 
alter egos in a fraction of a second before chasing after the sighted 
monster.

The youma was large and humanoid... at least twice Sailor Mars&#39; 
height... and with the bulging, thick corded muscles to match. Its 
hairless skin was a putrid blue and had a wolf-like head sitting atop 
its broad shoulders, its jowls with rows of rather nasty looking teeth; 
but that was not where the creature&#39;s primary weapon lay. It possessed a 
strange biomechanical weapon grafted onto each of its forearms that was 
capable of firing off some sort of violet energy beam. The beams were 
particularly dangerous, as the Sailors had unfortunately learned 
first-hand. While they caused a tolerable burning sensation wherever 
they hit, it was the subsequent effect of paralysis that posed the real 
threat.

Currently, Sailor Venus was crouched behind some low standing shelves, 
holding a hand to her right shoulder while the arm dangled limply by her 
side. Sailor Mercury was leaning heavily against a clothes rack with a 
shot to her left hip making her effectively immobile from the waist down 
on that side. Sailor Mars had not escaped from being struck by one of 
the many purple rays fired by the youma either; the muscles in her calf 
still occasionally twinged where one had winged her.

Sailor Moon snatched her tiara out of the air as the weapon returned to 
her from where she stood a couple of feet in front of Sailor Mars and 
Sailor Jupiter, having dealt the mortal blow to the blue creature. The 
glowing disc had ripped a deep gouge in the flesh on its side, exposing 
its rib bones and innards obscenely for all to see.

&quot;That&#39;s what... all you... things think!&quot; panted Sailor Moon out of 
breath from her exertions in the fierce battle. &quot;When will... you learn 
that... the champions of justice will always win!&quot; She then stood in 
what she must have thought was a heroic victory stance with one hand on 
her hip while the other slotted her tiara back into place on her 
forehead with slow deliberate precision.

Mars frowned irritably at the sight as the image shared many 
similarities with the store&#39;s mannequins. However, as she continued to 
look at the blonde odango atama, her frown faded. It was getting harder 
and harder for her to keep how she felt about Sailor Moon in check when 
she was around her. But that wasn&#39;t the worst part of it; it was seeing 
her princess with... *him*.

Sailor Mars knew she should be content that the girl was happy with 
Mamoru, but seeing them together always cut her up inside; the pain was 
unlike anything she had ever experienced. The fire senshi was jealous of 
the prince to the point where she had come to simply despise him on 
sight. She knew that she was being unreasonable, and the jealousy that 
motivated her hatred towards Sailor Moon&#39;s boyfriend was unwarranted, 
but she just couldn&#39;t help it.

Mars&#39; greatest fear was that she would one day come to even resent 
Sailor Moon, too... or worse; she would come to hate the blonde outright 
because of her apparent total disregard for how her bodyguard felt about 
her. It seemed impossible that there could even be the remotest chance 
of it ever coming to that... since the love Mars had for her princess 
filled her to the point of bursting... but then, she had never thought 
that she would ever look upon Mamoru with a cold hate-filled scowl, 
either. Something had to give, and soon. She couldn&#39;t take even being in 
the same room with Sailor Moon and the prince anymore. Seeing them 
together was a constant reminder of the hopeless love she had for her 
princess... a love that was certain to be forever unrequited....

&quot;...You have only delayed the inevitable,&quot; the youma was choking out in 
response to Sailor Moon&#39;s speech. A gout of green blood accompanied its 
words, spouting out of its mouth each time it opened and splattering 
down its chest onto the floor. &quot;There will be other times, other gates. 
You cannot be everywhere at once!&quot; The creature then laughed in a 
grotesque, hoarse timbre, its voice having been ruined earlier by a 
well-placed crescent beam courtesy of Sailor Venus.

&quot;Ehh... wha...?&quot; Sailor Moon replied in obvious confusion, blinking at 
the critically injured monster blankly.

&quot;Besides...&quot; continued the doomed youma, ignoring Sailor Moon&#39;s less 
than intelligent response, &quot;none of you will leave this place alive!!&quot; 
The badly scorched and bleeding creature rose up to its full height, and 
then roared out a sound as only the dying could. The racket rattled the 
remaining unbroken windows of the clothing store and dislodged dust 
motes from the ceiling that cascaded languidly down upon the Sailor 
Senshi.

The blue youma then raised its weapons and caused Sailor Mars&#39; muscles 
to tense as the girl watched the monster warily. She was ready to move 
and defend her princess at a moment&#39;s notice. The youma then turned 
sharply to its right and fired dual energy beams towards a pale, peach 
painted, pillar that supported the second floor of the building. The 
pillar was hit solidly in its middle section that crumbled to the floor 
in a pile of rubble around its base.

Mars and the rest of the Sailor Senshi were surprised. All of them had 
been expecting a direct attack against them.

&quot;He&#39;s trying to bring the whole building down on us!&quot; Sailor Jupiter 
cried out in horror from her defensive position behind a checkout 
counter to the right of the miko. She looked up with alarm as the 
ceiling creaked disturbingly.

Then furniture and other heavy objects from the second floor began to 
fall from widening cracks above the senshi as the youma blasted wildly 
at other supports. The riotous monster cackled madly, its foul, 
distorted voice booming all the while he shot the beams... which 
frequently missed the supports and punched numerous holes into the walls 
and ceiling instead.

Sailor Mars nimbly dodged out of the way of a falling crate as it 
crashed onto the floor beside her, spilling out a multitude of assorted 
socks. She swore under her breath as more and more objects rained down 
and smashed apart on the floor, obscuring the creature responsible for 
the devastation from her view, which in turn, denied a clear shot from 
her fire-based attacks.

&quot;The building won&#39;t last long without those supports!&quot; Sailor Mercury 
warned in a yell rising above the clamour of showering debris from where 
she still rested against the clothes rack. &quot;We have to get out of here 
*now*!!&quot;

&quot;Right! Sailor Moon, Sailor Mars; quick let&#39;s go!&quot; Venus called out to 
the two other senshi a short distance in front of her. The pair were 
located the closest to the youma, and hence, were in the most immediate 
danger. Sailor Venus then proceeded to climb to her feet and run as fast 
as she could towards the double door entrance/exit, a hand firmly 
clasped over the wound that had paralysed her right arm.

Sailor Mercury tried to flee also, but started to panic when she 
realised that her legs weren&#39;t reacting to her brain&#39;s fervent wishes. 
&quot;Ah...&quot; the blue-haired girl squeaked out, rapidly becoming flustered as 
she looked around frantically for some assistance.

&quot;Need a lift?&quot; said Jupiter with a smirk, scooping the surprised Mercury 
up into her strong arms as she ran by the shorter girl.

Sailor Mercury breathed a sigh of relief and leaned close to Sailor 
Jupiter as she was carried in the tall girl&#39;s arms. More masonry and 
furniture from the second floor fell about them and forced the brunette 
to weave a staggered path to avoid being clobbered.

Meanwhile, Sailor Moon and Sailor Mars had already started to beat a 
hasty retreat towards the front exit, but were still a good deal behind 
their friends. The other girls could hardly be made out now through the 
hail of raining debris.

&quot;Move it, odango atama!&quot; ordered Mars, trying to urge her princess into 
a faster pace as she turned to look at the blonde lagging slightly 
behind her. &quot;This is what happens when you pig out all of the time!&quot;

Sailor Moon opened her mouth to retaliate, her expression an odd 
combination of indignation at her best friend&#39;s insult, and fear at what 
was occurring around her. Suddenly, she cried out and fell flat on her 
face, landing on top of broken bits of wood and strewn articles of 
clothing. Just the absolute perfect time to klutz out in Mars&#39; opinion.

The Fire Senshi changed the direction of her sprint without hesitation 
and went back to where Sailor Moon had fallen, her mental sarcastic 
remarks quickly forgotten. Her mind was now fully focused on getting to, 
and protecting, her blonde love. &quot;On your feet, we don&#39;t have time for 
this!&quot; commanded Sailor Mars once again as she reached down for Sailor 
Moon&#39;s arm, about to drag her princess upright.

&quot;I can&#39;t...&quot; whimpered the blonde, tears starting to build up in her 
blue eyes as she gazed fretfully up at the Senshi of Fire. &quot;I-I can&#39;t 
feel my leg... I think it was h-hit by
one of those things....&quot;

&quot;Damn it,&quot; Mars cursed through clenched teeth, sparing a fleeting look 
over to the raging youma as it continued going about demolishing the 
store with its energy weapons.

&quot;Rahahahahaaa!!&quot; the blue skinned creature laughed uproariously, &quot;You 
fools are finished! Never have I lost a battle! Never! I&#39;m taking you 
to-- GARK!!&quot; The youma&#39;s tirade was cut short as a large cement block 
crashed down on its head, followed by the entire contents of the second 
floor the block had been supporting. The enemy&#39;s life was finally 
snuffed out as its skull and most of its body was pulverised into a 
sickly green paste. So much for Mr. or Ms. &#39;Never have I lost a battle&#39;.

&quot;Hurry!!&quot; Sailor Mars glanced at the double door entrance/exit of the 
store ten metres or so away where Sailor Venus waved to Sailor Moon and 
herself anxiously with her good arm. Her expression practically plead 
for them to flee. However, the ominous groaning from above didn&#39;t sound 
too encouraging.

&quot;Mars...&quot; Sailor Moon whispered apprehensively, having heard the 
creaking sound too.

It was clear to Mars that she and her princess were not going to make it 
to the Senshi of Love. The portentous noise from above got louder until 
the whole front part of the ceiling began to cave in. A tremendous crash 
resounded which hurt Sailor Mars&#39; eardrums and shook the very foundation 
of the building as debris totally blocked her view of the front of the 
store... and of the sight of Sailor Venus.

The raven-haired girl reacted quickly. Picking Sailor Moon up into her 
arms with some difficulty, she ran as best as she could deeper into the 
store. Half the second floor now took up residence in the front part of 
the store behind them, bringing with it a plumb of dust.

&quot;I hope... the others are... okay...&quot; choked out Sailor Moon from her 
bodyguard&#39;s arms as she coughed up inhaled dust particles, waving at the 
grey cloud swirling about Mars and herself with one hand as she did so.

In relative safety for the moment, the Senshi of Fire set Sailor Moon 
gently down on a mound of fallen blue jeans, and then squinted while she 
attempted to identify the dark shapes she saw in the fog of dust. There 
had to be another exit. &quot;Come on, it&#39;s a clothing store for the gods&#39; 
sakes! It&#39;s supposed to have a lot of display windows!&quot; Sailor Mars 
snarled to herself, frustrated with her inability to find a suitable 
escape route.

Finally, the miko spotted a doorway on the back wall of the store that 
had had its top frame partially crushed downwards, causing the door to 
be forced open. She surmised that it must lead outside to a loading area 
or something similar, but it didn&#39;t appear to be very stable. Then 
again, the whole second floor above Mars and Sailor Moon wasn&#39;t very 
stable.

As if to prove her point, there was yet another groan from what remained 
of the ceiling over the Fire Senshi and her crippled love. The 
raven-haired girl looked down at her princess and stated, &quot;Look alive, 
odango atama; I may have found us an exit!&quot;

Sailor Moon looked up at the Inner Senshi with watery blue eyes. The 
dust, coupled with her bout of coughing, having irritated them. She 
wiped her eyes, then reached her arms out to Mars and made grabbing 
motions with her hands to indicate to the miko that she needed to be 
carried again.

Sailor Mars rolled her eyes, and then dutifully gathered her princess 
into her arms once more, straining only marginally under the weight of 
the slight girl. The Fire Senshi hoped the odango atama wouldn&#39;t get 
used to being carried around by her, but it did feel rather... pleasant 
holding her love that close to her body. Sailor Moon felt so delicate, 
so fragile, in her grasp, it made the fire senshi feel even more 
protective over her true love. Mars blushed a little at the feelings she 
was experiencing and hoped that the churning dust motes would hide it.

Sailor Mars&#39; thoughts were abruptly interrupted by Sailor Moon squirming 
and yelling out, &quot;We&#39;re gonna be pancakes!!&quot; towards the now rapidly 
crumbling ceiling.

Mars immediately burst into motion and made a mad dash towards the 
previously sighted doorway, while all sorts of debris ranging from 
bricks to underwear, showered down around them. Many of the more solid 
objects clipped the Fire Senshi&#39;s body, but the small bumps did little 
to deter her progress to get her princess to safety. They were going to 
make it; there was no way Sailor Mars was going to get killed by a 
bombardment of clothes! She hotly refused to go out in such a lame way. 
Besides, failure to protect Sailor Moon was simply not an option.

At that moment the youma had the last laugh. Mars felt her calf cramp up 
from the energy beam blast she had suffered earlier and stumbled 
forwards, nearly dropping Sailor Moon onto the floor.

&quot;Gaa! Mars!&quot; Sailor Moon cried out in fright, hastily wrapping her arms 
around her bodyguard&#39;s neck and holding on to her for dear life.

The muscles in the Senshi of Fire&#39;s leg seized up again and a numb 
sensation began to spread out from the source of the cramp, travelling 
swiftly up her leg to her hip. No... not yet. Mars couldn&#39;t falter yet. 
Not when she still had to evacuate her love from danger. Silently, 
Sailor Mars made her choice. Shaking her neck free of Sailor Moon&#39;s 
hands, she hobbled towards the doorway as fast as she could, ignoring 
the icy cold tendrils of numbness creeping up her body and injecting its 
paralysis into her muscles.

&quot;Mars, what...?&quot; Sailor Moon started to question, glancing up into her 
Fire Senshi&#39;s amethyst eyes with worried blue ones.

&quot;I hope you&#39;re... lighter in flight... than you... are now, odango 
atama,&quot; Mars interrupted, panting between breaths. She then winced as 
her leg started to buckle and wordlessly prayed to the gods to grant her 
the strength to continue just a few moments longer.

&quot;What? Sailor Mars, what do you... no wait! Oh Rei... don&#39;t!&quot; Sailor 
Moon pleaded her bodyguard with wide, panic stricken eyes rapidly 
pooling with tears. She realised, now, what the fire senshi intended to 
do. &quot;I won&#39;t leave you behind!!&quot;

Mars&#39; life was worthless when compared to Sailor Moon&#39;s; there was 
nothing the blonde could say that would change her best friend&#39;s mind. 
Sailor Mars looked at Sailor Moon and flashed her a swaggering smile 
accompanied by a wink in an attempt to humour her princess. &quot;I&#39;ll be... 
right behind you!&quot;

Then, using what little strength she had left, Sailor Mars threw her 
true love in the direction of the doorway, not even having enough energy 
to grunt as she did so. Sailor Moon cried out as her shoulders scraped 
past the doorframe. Unfortunately, the movement caused the weakened 
structure to give way and a torrent of bricks collapsed inward, filling 
the only exit to capacity. At least the blonde was thankfully unharmed 
on the other side.

Sailor Mars dropped to her knees and toppled forwards with her forearms 
hitting the floor as her wounded leg gave out. Her muscles burned and 
her limbs felt like lead weights. Sailor Moon had been heavier than the 
miko had originally thought, and hurling the girl had required 
everything she had.

With the ceiling caving in around her, it looked like it was the end for 
Sailor Mars. Looking on the bright side, though, it did solve the 
problem she had with Mamoru being her princess&#39; lover. She wondered idly 
if Sailor Moon would shed a tear or two for her untimely demise. Stupid; 
of course the blonde would. She had compassion for everyone... even for 
a weird, short-tempered, psychic miko like Mars who constantly picked on 
her.

Sailor Mars&#39; self-pity was interrupted as a large cement block, along 
with a crate, fell through the ceiling and crashed through the floor in 
front of her. The fire senshi felt the floorboards wobble, then slide at 
an angle towards the new hole in the floor, taking the despairing girl 
with them. Raising her forearms across her face for protection, Mars was 
plunged into the jagged hole. She landed heavily on top of the 
splintered remains of the crate that had come to rest on the floor 
below, the impact knocking the wind out of her.

&quot;Ugh...&quot; Sailor Mars groaned as she lay half-stunned, face down on her 
stomach. The pain of her fall was dulled, thankfully, due to the fact 
her body was now completely numbed and paralysed from the chest down 
courtesy of the now slain youma&#146;s energy bolt.

Judging by her surroundings it looked like she was in the basement. Mars 
flipped over onto her back with difficultly and looked to the side. Her 
addled mind noted ridiculously that she owned one of the skirts that had 
spilled out of the destroyed crate she had landed on. Her exploration, 
however, was short-lived. Looking upwards at the hole she had fallen 
through, Sailor Mars saw the second floor... and what was left of its 
contents... plummeting towards her.

Sailor Mars&#39; last thoughts were of Sailor Moon... her unrequited love, 
as she raised her arms over her head one last time in a feeble attempt 
to protect herself from an entire building crashing down upon her.

To be continued....


Author&#39;s ramblings:

And so ends the first chapter. How long is this story going to be? I 
have no idea. I hope it&#39;s good so far...

As you saw, there is some violence and some bad language. Expect more of 
each. ^_^ Expect more bad guys too... and hopefully a half-decent plot.

Hope my grammar was okay, I have a real problem with that...

odango atama = dumpling head
senshi = soldier
miko = Shinto priestess</pre>
