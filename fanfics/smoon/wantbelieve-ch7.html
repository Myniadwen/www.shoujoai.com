<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finding Answers<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The image of a wounded Venus had plagued her dreams.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  night before, in the precious hour of sleep she’d gotten after fleeing  from Minako, Rei had been close to uncovering a piece of the vision  that had evaded her ever since it had triggered the memories of her  past life almost two weeks prior. But the vision had slipped through  the miko’s fingers once more, and after she’d completed her morning  duties, she’d found herself in the fireroom trying to track it down  again.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>There must be a link,’</em> she reasoned, <em>‘between that past… nightmare and my present life.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  certainly had enough on her mind, but considering the way she’d left  things with her best friend the night before, and especially  considering the rampant emotions she’d been dealing with for said  woman, this diversion wasn’t entirely unwanted, either. Knowing what  she <em>should</em> be thinking about, now that she was equipped with  the knowledge that Minako wanted her the same way she’d wanted her best  friend all these years, she should be thinking about whether or not she  was ready to let Minako into her heart as something other than as her  friend…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But a familiar voice snarled at her,</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>You should not be here.” </em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And  as Sailor Mars danced at the edge of Rei’s consciousness, she grasped  the diversion instead. This time, she would find the vision. Closing  her eyes, the miko concentrated, and surrendered herself to the flames.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">With  her best friend having been training in the mountains of Kyoto for the  past three years, it had been a long time since Aino Minako had climbed  the stone stairs of the Hikawa Shrine, but she still remembered each  and every step by heart. A mischievous smirk teased her lips as she  reached the top. She doubted the miko would expect her impromptu visit,  and that made the occasion all that much more enjoyable. She wondered  what kind of havoc she might be able to wreak on the shrine maiden’s  quiet morning.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pulling the brim of her baseball hat lower over  her eyes, the idol tiptoed around the courtyard. Keeping an eye out for  the seemingly ever present novice miko, she slipped onto one of the  breezeways and headed down the wooden walkway as quietly as possible.  She managed to stumble across Rei quickly, catching a glimpse of the  dark haired woman’s kneeling form through a slightly opened shoji  screen door.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako stood outside that door for some time. She’d  never seen her best friend at work before the flames, and from the  three quarter view granted her, she stared in awe at Rei’s intense  concentration and stiff posture, from her squinted shut eyes to the  thin sheen of sweat that beaded across her forehead.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Fearing  being caught by a passerby, the singer finally slipped inside and,  thankful for her stealthy abilities; for to avoid detection by the  extra sensory miko was quite the accomplishment, she quietly slid the  paper door fully shut behind her. Resting on her knees at the back of  the room, Minako maintained her distance, content to simply observe  this never before seen side of the miko.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But when Rei gasped, her  eyes squinting shut even tighter, her knuckles turning white, Minako  wondered what the psychic was seeing, for she seemed so very frightened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  gasped. The blood covered ground that was sticky beneath her boots, the  rocky outcrop that dug into the exposed skin of her back, the biting  stench of sulfur that stole her breath, the howling winds - she knew  this place. She knew it in this life, through this elusive memory she’d  finally captured, but she knew it in her past life, too. Her wounded  commander, hidden from view by the stern and forbidding mirror image of  herself, was just beyond her reach. Mars was <em>guarding</em> her leader, but why?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus… is she going to be alright? I have to know-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor  Mars took a step forward. Her hands balled into fists and her words  came out short and clipped. “You must leave this place now. It’s for  your own good. You should not have seen as much as you have.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But-“</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mars’ brows met. She almost snarled. “Leave! Now!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  winds howled and the mists that lingered behind Sailor Mars rushed  towards Rei. The miko sensed that the frigid blackness that her past  self was commanding would sever her link with the memory, but before it  could envelop her, Rei lunged forward, grasping the senshi of fire by  the wrist.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor Mars was caught off guard. The mists retreated.  Those red tinged eyes widened with surprise, but then squinted with  anger. “You weak representation of my reincarnated self,” she spat,  “what are you doing?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Finding answers.” Rei shot back coldly. “Now step aside.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You petulant child, don’t you know what’s best for you?” Mars threatened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">In the senshi’s hurtful words, in her cold demeanor, Rei saw herself. <em>‘No,</em>’ she decided, <em>‘my younger self.’</em> She’d matured past this frightened woman. But what had made the Reiko  of the past turn like this? The memories that Rei had recovered had  shown Mars as having developed into a calm and confident warrior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sailor  Mars flinched when Rei’s hand came to rest over her heart, and the miko  drew in a shuddering breath as she opened a connection between the  personas of her past and present.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Never had Rei felt such raw  emotion, such intense pain, pain that burned to the touch, pain that  burned hotter than the flames of Mars itself. And through it all, as  she searched Sailor Mars’ familiar emotions and memories, the only  explanation, the single scene that she could see in the woman’s heart,  was the image of the wounded Venus, lying broken on the battlefield.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>It hurts!’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Keeping  an eye on the distressed miko, Minako frowned. Rising from her knees,  she crouched on her feet, at the ready to dash to her best friend at a  moment’s notice.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But what would she do? What could she do? Rei was obviously in the throes of some kind of vision.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>What if it’s a vision from our past?’</em> Minako asked herself, and then wondered what could have produced such a  troubling response. She worried her lower lip restlessly. <em>‘Maybe she hasn’t remembered </em>everything <em>yet.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  when the miko’s body began trembling uncontrollably, and tears began to  course down the smooth skin of Rei’s cheeks, the singer couldn’t hold  herself back anymore.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako was across the room in two seconds, wrapping her arms around Rei, and pulling her back towards her body.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  soothing torrent doused the flames of pain that coursed through the  link between Sailor Mars and Rei, but still, the miko did not release  her hold on her mirror image. Though she felt weak and confused,  wondering at the source that had tamed the unbridled fear Mars had  shown her, she felt a need to keep the connection open even as the last  trace of fear and hopelessness vanished from the long haired warrior.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, the senshi of fire’s eyes slid closed, and to Rei’s amazement, the smallest of smiles found her parched lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s been so long since I’ve felt this.” The quiet whisper barely reached Rei’s ears.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko tilted her head slightly. “Felt what?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You mean you really don’t know?” The cold frown returned to Mars’ face. “You really are still a child.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei frowned in confusion, but then, the warmth was too much, enveloping her fully. She shut her eyes, and surrendered to it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She  was surrounded by warmth. It was behind her, around her. A soothing,  rhythmic beat that originated from behind her slowed her own heart rate  and before she realized it, her heartbeat fell into synch with it. The  beat seemed tied to gentle puff of warm air, almost a breath that hers  soon joined. A subtle scent of jasmine teased her sense of smell. It  was a familiar scent, but in that space between dreams and wakefulness,  between her vision and consciousness, she couldn’t quite put her finger  on it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally opening her eyes, Rei found herself looking  sideways at the familiar caramel gaze of her best friend, and that’s  when she realized she was surrounded by Minako; held in an embrace from  behind, and sitting on the floor of the fireroom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">She could have  reacted; freaked out, yelled, or pushed Minako away, but Rei had been  pulled into those caramel pools, and for just a second, she tried to  comprehend what she saw in them, what she <em>felt</em> in them. Had it  really been Minako who has eased herself and Sailor Mars? Had those  emotions that had neutralized those of the fearful senshi of fire  really been hers?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei was met with her mirror image’s testy voice as a reply, <em>“You really are still a child.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  granted Rei a gentle smile and the long haired woman blinked her eyes  repeatedly. The miko found that she didn’t know if she was coming out  of a dream or falling into one, but the last thing she realized was  that she wasn’t at all alarmed by having found herself in such a  position as she may have expected herself to be. And with that  realization, the immediacy of the vision she’d chased, even Mars’  words, seemed entirely less important.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I think we need to talk.”  Minako’s words were a reverent whisper in the small room, but given the  closeness of their bodies, they were felt as much as heard by the other  woman.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei nodded slowly, her gaze still stuck on her best  friend’s, safe in knowing that Minako must be referring to their  present, to the awkwardness of the night before, and not the past  memory she had been chasing. Though she would have been content to sit  there forever, content in Minako’s warm embrace, she owed the singer  answers, answers she’d have to reveal sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But beyond  the occasional pop and crackle of the sacred flame, Rei could hear the  chattering voices of the junior miko, and this set her on edge. “This  probably isn’t the best place,” she hazarded, acutely aware of the  small shiver that ran through Minako’s body as her warm breath hit the  other woman’s neck.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I have a car waiting on the street,” Minako offered flatly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  lifted an amused eyebrow. “A little confident, are we?” Her verbal barb  was subdued, half hearted; she wasn’t looking for a fight.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer smirked. She had come prepared, and through a pregnant pause,  she looked into Rei’s dark eyes hopefully, “Will you come with me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Their  eyes implored each other at Minako’s gentle question; unassuming,  undemanding, she was leaving the decision in Rei’s hands. Finally, the  woman in question nodded, her head still resting against the singer’s  collarbone.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Just let me change.” She agreed, motioning to her miko garb.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  was elated at having achieved the precise response she’d hoped for, and  Rei was torn between the fear of opening up to her best friend and the  sudden need she felt to be as physically and as mentally close to the  confusing woman as possible. But still, neither woman made an effort to  get up, neither wanting to end their seemingly perfect moment.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Reluctantly,  the idol finally released her arms from around the miko, but when Rei  didn’t jump away from her as she’d half expected, and only continued to  sit there, still leaning into her chest, still maintaining eye contact  with her, Minako smiled, and when Rei returned that smile, the singer  slipped her arms around the miko once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Just a couple more minutes.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  fought to keep a blush and a goofy grin from her face as Minako  energetically bounced down the shrine stairs. Occasionally looking back  at the miko over her shoulder, a wide grin tugged at Minako’s lips as  she eyed the spot where they were physically connected - the singer  having a playful grip on the cuff of the miko’s wool jacket.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But  when they made it to the street, that energetic bounce, that carefree  smile disappeared; for standing in front of Minako’s black sedan was  the obviously impatient Saitou Sugao.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Shacho?” Minako asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan!”  He wailed, rushing towards his protégé, but at the recognition of the  woman she clung to, he awkwardly halted his approach.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  smirked. Minako’s manager had remembered the time they had last met,  when she had drummed him out of Makoto’s engagement party, insistent  that he not infringe on the small amount of time the pop star could  spare away from work. The man wavered a moment, but then deciding his  purpose was greater than Rei’s, ushered both women into the waiting  car, hopped in behind them, and slammed the door shut.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The car  pulled away from the curb before Minako could even protest. She sent an  apologetic, helpless look to Rei, who simply shrugged it off. This  time, the least she could do was wait to see what was so important as  to interrupt their date.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Outing.’ </em>Rei reminded herself sharply.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mou,  Mi-na-ko! You should be in the studio cutting your new record right  now!” Saitou whined, carefully avoiding eye contact with the unreadable  miko for fear that she’d grow two heads and bite him in half. Rei, for  her part, did her best not to frighten him further. Still unsure of  continuing the conversation with Minako that she’d run away from the  night before, and simply content to be in her best friend’s presence,  she could be patient with the effeminate man. If just this once.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  nasally voice of Saitou faded as Rei examined Minako in a critical  sideways glance. In those caramel eyes, the miko saw a well hidden  exhaustion that had surfaced as soon as her manager had pulled out a  stack of paper for her to examine. She noticed the subtle slump of the  singer’s shoulders and the tight line her lips made. And as she had  suspected the night before at the concert, she could see once more that  Minako was taking on more than she could handle, that the years of  performing and being in the public eye were finally getting to her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And Rei was unhappy with what she saw.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako’s  run in with work ended up lasting most of the day. The miko had been  dragged to the singer’s office in downtown Tokyo where she’d bared  witness to Minako’s hectic work life. But now they found themselves  sitting across from each other in two large easy chairs, unwinding in a  small coffee shop along the Juuban strip as the last rays of the  setting sun cast a warm orange glow through the smoked windows.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>She’d have to have ordered hot chocolate.’</em> Rei mused, trying to shelve Reiko’s memories of a similar event as she  palmed her cup of tea. Resorting to only stolen glances, it took a  great amount of effort not to stare as the former senshi of love slowly  lifted her oversized mug to her lips.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m sorry about today. You must have been bored.” The singer said offhandedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  can’t say it was exciting. For either of us.” Rei looked at Minako  meaningfully. “Why is Saitou-san hounding you about your new album so  much? Your encore concert was only yesterday, and it’s not like it  wasn’t a big hit; the media won’t stop talking about it. Do you really  need to start recording a new album so soon?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer sighed.  She could put on a show for the entire world, but her best friend had  seen right through her, as always. “It wasn’t always like this. I used  to love my job. But with each new album you release, each tour you wrap  up, the public is always looking for the next best thing. It’s…  increasingly stressful.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Sounds like hell.” The miko commented between shallow sips of tea.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer smacked her lips at her best friend until she realized that the  miko hadn’t spoken out of sarcasm, but Minako still felt the need to  defend herself. “I guess this all sounds pretty silly to you, huh? I  mean, I have this total dream job, but it can be such a drag.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei shrugged almost noncommittally. “I think we all question our career choices at times.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako arched an eyebrow. “Even the great Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Especially  the great Rei.” The miko returned evenly before sipping her tea. How  could she explain to Minako the reasons behind the decision about her  career that she’d yet to present to her elders? She couldn’t, not yet.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally,  she found something she could settle on. “Let’s just say that my career  isn’t turning out quite the way I thought it would myself.” Minako  looked to her questioningly, and Rei felt the need to shift the topic  of conversation back where it belonged, “So, tell me more about the  trouble with your career.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer read Rei’s feint but  decided to roll with it for the time being. Conversations with Rei were  generally a game of picking and choosing battles, and she knew she  could come back to that topic later.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“The only thing that keeps  me interested at all anymore is my charity division. Well, I mean, it’s  under my name, and I barely get to do anything to help with it, but  when I do, it makes all the hard work I do seem worth it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  sat her cup down, her fingers splayed around its rim as she leaned  across the coffee table that separated them. “I remember hearing about  that. After we…” she stumbled for a moment, looking for an appropriate  word so as not to stir up any other uncomfortable conversation, “after  we <em>came back</em>, after Usagi righted the world, you set up a charity for children with brain tumors, right?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  crossed her legs and also leaned forward, mimicking Rei’s action and  leaving very little space between them. “Yeah. People were a little  surprised, seeing as how I wasn’t even suffering with the disease when  we all… came back, but the organization was well received and its done  a lot of good raising money for research and rehabilitation, not to  mention how fulfilling it feels to visit patients in the hospital who  are sick with the disease.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko had recognized that spark of  excitement that had returned to the singer’s eyes. Charity works were  definitely something she could relate to. “So why don’t you just focus  on your charity division and put your singing career on hold for a  while, indefinitely, if that’s what you want.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Pausing blankly,  Minako looked at Rei as if her best friend really had grown two heads.  Could life really be so simple as to follow her own heart? She chuckled  a little. And when Rei looked to her in question, the singer set her  cup down, stood, and put her jacket on.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Let’s go for a walk.”  The willful idol tossed the instruction over her shoulder and slipped  towards the door, thoroughly expecting her former second in command to  follow.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko had to fumble to catch up, but with Rei on  Minako’s heels, the two friends exited the coffee shop onto the busy  Juuban sidewalk. The sun having set, the neon light of the city night  illuminated their crystallized puffs of breath that hung in the air  expectantly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The rush of salarymen filing from their jobs in a  race to the railways crushed around the two, stifling Rei as she fought  to keep up with the singer in the bustle. But when Minako’s hand once  again found the sleeve of her heavy jacket and pulled her next to her,  the normally standoffish miko breathed a sigh of relief. Suddenly,  being next to the other woman again, the world seemed to slow down to a  more tolerable pace.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And that was when Rei noticed the slight smirk on Minako’s lips. “Just what’s so funny?” She demanded,<br />
  “and where are we going, anyway?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer grinned evilly. “While ‘A Day in the Life of Minako’ may have  been an interesting diversion, don’t think I’ve forgotten our purpose  here. Just because my work interrupted our day doesn’t mean you’ve  gotten off the hook for last night. You still have some explaining to  do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snapped her mouth shut, suddenly finding the sidewalk  much more interesting to look at. But she managed to quell the  butterflies in her stomach. She was ready for this. Being like this all  day; being with Minako, sharing, learning, she felt she’d been given  what she needed to feel comfortable with taking the chance of letting  Minako get closer to her. She finally knew it would be okay to let this  one woman, who meant so much to her, close to her heart.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">And when she’d gathered the courage to look back into Minako’s eyes, she realized something else, first. <em>‘When did we start holding hands?’</em> She wondered; for the singer’s fingers no longer gripped her jacket sleeve, but were laced between her own fingers snugly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer stopped, causing the distracted miko to press against her. Rei  looked up at the upscale apartment building they’d stopped in front of  in question.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“My apartment…” Minako said quietly, afraid her voice alone would cause Rei to flee, “will you… come up?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  slight blush on her cheeks, Rei met Minako’s questioning, hopeful gaze,  and with a squeeze of her hand around Minako’s, she led them into the  building.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">I promise, in the next  chapter, they’ll finally talk things through! This chapter was largely  set up, but also important for Rei to feel more comfortable with her  emotions. Trust me when I say it’ll make the next chapter all that much  more… rewarding.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, Chapter 8:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  was a clock that eventually disrupted them; it’s not so subtle chime  reminding the women that it was midnight. The miko moaned her  displeasure. “It’s going to be a rough morning.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t have  to be,” Minako responded with a slight smirk. When Rei frowned at her,  she continued playfully, “you could just stay the night here you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  opened her mouth to protest, but then realized she didn’t really want  to. However, still having an image to uphold, she looked away  haughtily, stole her hand from Minako’s own, and crossed her arms over  her chest. “I don’t know. I’ll have to get up pretty early. As a miko,  I <em>do</em> have responsibilities to the shrine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Playing along,  Minako snorted and stuck her nose in the air. “Well then, I’ll just  call my driver to bring you back to the shrine. I certainly don’t want  the world’s best miko to disrupt her duties.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women  chuckled, looked at each other, and broke into a sudden fit of  laughter. Finally, Rei acquiesced. “I’ll stay.” She said, her lilting  voice laced with laughter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako smirked at her best friend. “Okay. I’ll be sure not to defile the shrine maiden <em>tonight</em> then.” She said offhandedly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko had the decency to feign offence at the singer’s jest.</span></p>
