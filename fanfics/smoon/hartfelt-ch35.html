<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 35 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch34.html">Back to Part 34</a><p><b><hr></b></p><p><u>(Rei, City of the Gods, City Square)</u></p><p>After passing by a 
few of the landmarks and never encountering nor sensing a single soul, the group’s 
suspicions were confirmed: The City of the Gods, no matter how elegant it had been in the 
past it was only a shadow of its former glory now. It was dead like the Moon 
Kingdom.</p><p>The irony struck the group funny in a bitter sense; both civilizations, ruled 
by the strongest of rulers were reduced to nothing while those who were only their loyal 
subjects had persevered.</p><p>“<i>I don’t understand.”</i></p><p>Rei’s footsteps slowed. 
She nearly had a heart attack when the earlier apparition strode past her and paused by the 
fountain.</p><p>“<i>I-I can’t believe I actually told her how I felt! What was I thinking?! 
Why did I do that?!” He grasped at his head and shook it in disbelief. “Her eyes… she said 
she understood, but, she doesn’t at all--! How can she, when she looks upon me as a child 
who has yet to grow up?”</i></p><p><i>Could it be?</i> Rei’s eyes widened.</p><p><i>The man 
fell to his knees.</i></p><p>“<i>B-Because of everyone… I can’t be weak. I can’t cry. I have 
to be strong… I have to be… pure, because…. I am the Sun God. They tell me how strong I am, 
but if they could only see me like this! On my knees, and screaming inside! It’s not fair,” 
His voice dipped to a whisper. “Why do I have to feel like this? Born with such cursed 
feelings? When I’m trying so hard! Trying to keep it all together so we all can live 
happily… But my hands,” his gaze shifted, “everything is slipping through them. L-Look at 
me… I’m shaking! Haha…ha…ha-ah… Ah-haaaaaa----!!”</i></p><p>The sorrowful wail prompted Rei 
to step back as she watched the man’s image fade away.</p><p>“Rei?” Haruka shook her hard by 
the shoulders. “Hey, didn’t you hear a word I said?! We have to keep our guard up here! 
There’s no telling what we might run into!”</p><p>The Martian slowly turned her gaze to meet 
her friend’s. “Did you… just see that?”</p><p>“…<i>Make it go away…”</i></p><p>“See what?” 
Haruka frowned.</p><p>“…Nothing.” <i>I guess they can’t see it</i>. Her heart skipped a beat 
when she saw the apparition disappear down a narrow street to their right. Why was her heart 
telling her to follow?</p><p>“C’mon, we’ll head towards the palace like planned. It’s our 
best bet on catching Hotaru.”</p><p>“But which way shall we go now?” Ami 
questioned.</p><p>The square offered many different paths, but the streets signs were of no 
help. Many of the lettering on the signs were illegible due to rust and the buildings were 
too high to spot their target beforehand. In the face of this, how could one possible tell 
the quickest way to their destination? It was a predicament that threw the success of their 
plan into jeopardy.</p><p>“Okay, let’s not panic. Maybe we can scan a few of the streets and 
pick up a hint… but then again, that might take too much time…” Haruka mumbled to 
herself.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>A figure rushed past her.</p><p>“Rei?! Where 
do you think you’re going?! Come back!”</p><p>But the raven-haired woman ignored the 
concerned cries and continued to run after the specter. The rational side of her mind 
pleaded with her to stop this foolishness and to listen to reason; ‘You don’t even know what 
you’re chasing!’ Was it a ghost? Or was it a lingering memory shed by its former self in a 
desperate attempt to be rid of it? Whatever it was she pushed on with the knowledge that 
there was no guarantee that she was heading down the right path; not every spirit wished 
goodwill towards those who could still enjoy life’s gifts. Especially one who has viciously 
hunted them all with such contempt!</p><p>Despite that, somehow her body wouldn’t listen. 
There was someone was calling to her.</p><p>…<i>That’s the right path…</i> They 
whispered.</p><p><u>(City—house)</u></p><p>Rei gasped for breath when the specter finally 
slowed in its pace. In her mind’s eye she could see more of them now. There was a group of 
children playing outside of a house along the street. They stopped the King as he passed 
by.</p><p>“<i>Hey! Hey, have you come to play with us again Uncle Apollo?!” A little boy 
toothily grinned. “You and Aunty Artemis promised to come play with us again, 
remember?”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes… we did, didn’t we?” He wearily smiled back. “Unfortunately, my 
sister is resting within the palace as we speak. She’s had a long 
day...”</i></p><p>“<i>Awww… she isn’t feeling well?” A girl pouted. Apollo knew this child 
idolized his sibling. He couldn’t blame her. Artemis was a wonderful 
person.</i></p><p>“<i>She’ll be all right. She’s just tired.”</i></p><p>“<i>Oh, I see… But, 
but! You never get sick, do you Uncle Apollo?! Cause you’re super strong and cool, and, 
and…” The boy fumbled for words as the others were furiously nodding their heads in 
agreement.</i></p><p><i>A chill ran down the King’s spine.</i></p><p>“<i>I want to be just 
like you when I grow up!”</i></p><p><i>Apollo weakly smiled and placed a gentle hand on the 
child’s head. “You don’t need to be like me. Just live your lives, and… appreciate who you 
are. All of you are unique and special in your own way. It is easier to wish to be like 
another... Desiring their power, talent or wealth… However, learning to appreciate oneself 
and those around you, for what you all are… is more difficult than becoming someone you are 
not. But I have faith in all of you...”</i></p><p><i>The statement had somewhat confused the 
boy. “Then I’m special the way I am?”</i></p><p>“<i>Yes.”</i></p><p>“…” <i>The boy shyly met 
the God’s orange eyes. “…Uncle Apollo?”</i></p><p>“<i>Hm?”</i></p><p>“<i>When I’m old… will 
you still come to see me?”</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>“<i>Grandpa says that he can’t go outside 
anymore because he’s old. He has trouble doing a lot of stuff these days. Sometimes he says 
he wishes he were a God because Gods don’t age. One day, I’m going to get old too, right? 
So… umm… if I can’t come outside to see you anymore… will you come to see 
me?”</i></p><p><i>When Apollo finally recovered from the shock, he smiled once 
again.</i></p><p>“<i>...Of course.”</i></p><p>Rei watched as the God played with the 
children for a bit. He didn’t stay long though. Before everyone knew it he was hurrying off 
with a goodbye.</p><p>“<i>I’m sorry, but I must be going now!”</i></p><p>“<i>Okay! But, but… 
come again soon! And bring Aunty Artemis too!”</i></p><p>The Martian sensed his frazzled 
aura as he made his quick escape. It was unstable now, but she didn’t have time to ponder on 
it for long before she was forced to give chase to keep up with him.</p><p><u>(City main 
street)</u></p><p>When she finally stopped again, Rei noticed three new specters this time. 
They were young men who appeared to be in their early twenties. They stopped the God as he 
passed by.</p><p>“<i>Your Highness, is everything all right? You look almost ill!” One of 
them worriedly inquired.</i></p><p>“…” <i>Apollo’s mouth set itself into a thin 
line.</i></p><p>“<i>Shall we escort you back to the palace? We would be happy to! Just say 
the word!”</i></p><p>“<i>No! Just stay away from me!” The King flung his arm out and forced 
the startled boys back. Hurt expressions appeared on their faces in reaction to the distrust 
that their Lord bared towards them and dangerously intrigue due to the flash of silver eyes 
where brilliant orange shone only seconds before.</i></p><p><i>Apollo blinked at their 
horrified expressions, and shook his head to bat way the sick sensation. When he re-opened 
his eyes, they were orange again.</i></p><p>“<i>I-I apologize. Perhaps I am not feeling well 
after all…” He mumbled. “Please, carry on with your duties. I shall return to the palace on 
my own accord.”</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>As he passed her, Rei analyzed him with a contemplative 
look in her eyes. <i>His eyes changed color for a second there. I remember in Setsuna’s 
vision that they were always gray. Could this be the first time that it 
happened?</i></p><p>She followed after him.</p><p><u>(City road)</u></p><p>Patiently Rei 
continued to trail after him down the lonely streets. He was almost limping now, and his 
shoulders were slumped in resignation.</p><p>To Rei’s astonishment, transparent rain soaked 
the dry trails; as she ventured through the otherworldly medium her skin tingled against the 
chills that enveloped her.</p><p>“…<i>Must… be pure… I-I must… forget…” His voice cracked. 
The man’s eyes flashed between silver and orange.</i></p><p>“<i>Why can’t they feel my pain? 
Why must I be the one who is in agony?! Allowing people to be always happy, what sort of 
paradise is this? People cannot grow if they cannot feel pain. They cannot become stronger! 
That’s right… they’ll just become weak, and… since the subjects reflect the rule of the 
ruler, it would be inappropriate for the subjects of the King of the Gods to be weak. It’d 
be a disgrace! But… the strongest are already part of my court. They are rather cheerful 
aren’t they? Always smiling and laughing… They’re supposed to be the closest to me, and yet 
they are oblivious. Haha… ignorant to a fool who is losing his mind. Oh, I’ll have to punish 
them for that I suppose. I’ll make them strong!”</i></p><p><i>Apollo’s head suddenly 
throbbed and he gasped when the nauseous feeling returned. This time he threw up, inwardly 
shivering with horror at the twisted words leaving his lips.</i></p><p>“<i>Ah---ah-ah… I 
can’t take this anymore! Please… Help me!” Desperate orange eyes turned upwards toward the 
palace ahead.</i></p><p>“… <i>Artemis…”</i></p><p>With the utterance of the name, the 
illusion shattered and Rei was faced with the looming palace structure. Her heart had yet to 
calm down, and her mouth felt so dry.</p><p><i>Is this really… what the former King was 
like?</i></p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>Rei’s head shot up when the sound of distant footsteps 
caught in her ears. They were not coming from behind her—no! They were in front of her. A 
dark-haired individual was feverishly scaling the palace steps towards the 
entranceway.</p><p><i>Hotaru?!</i></p><p>“Hotaru---wait!” She called after her. “You can’t 
just rush in there! What if it’s a trap?!”</p><p>A vision of a dark-swirling mass with 
crimson eyes flashed through her mind.</p><p><b>Ping!</b></p><p>“Nng---!” Rei gripped at her 
head in response to the evil aura. She outstretched her hand towards the disappearing body 
as if to catch her and hold her there in place with her will.</p><p><i>I can feel it now! 
D-Don’t go there! Don’t go in there, Hotaru! He’s waiting--</i></p><p>Rei’s concerned 
gesture remained ignored by the other youth. Hotaru’s clouded eyes were too focused on the 
darkness that awaited her. As if a moth drawn to a flame, she allowed her hatred consumed 
heart to throw its anguish into her powerful movements as she silently raged against the 
unseen enemy hidden within the ominous tomb. Her patient ears had become deaf to the cries 
of warning. Only unrivalled fury bellowed loudly in her soul like a God of Death who has 
only been released from its chains of slumber. Instinct was the only thing controlling her 
body now.</p><p>“Hotaru!” Rei shouted at her friend’s retreating back. She hesitated to 
follow, and was astonished by the uncertainty that hindered her actions now.</p><p><i>I…</i> 
Rei’s hands curled into determined fists. <i>Why am I hesitating...? I have to stop 
her!</i></p><p>“Hotaru!”</p><p>The Martian ducked down and pushed ahead in a swift dash, 
gaining in both momentum and stride as she chased after the shadow of a friend who was, in 
turn, consumed by the shadows of the palace.</p><p>As she climbed the steps, the 
amethyst-eyed woman became vaguely aware of the surprised cries of her other friends behind 
her. Even Minako’s pleas for her patience echoed somewhat distantly to her. There just 
wasn’t any time to explain; due to her lack of courage in the critical seconds previous, 
Hotaru had already entered the palace. Thus it came as a frustrating shock to the Martian 
when she met with resistance near the entranceway; the menacing aura leaking out of the 
palace pressed heavily against her body as if it were trying to choke her. It demanded an 
exorbitant amount of effort for every step she took.</p><p>“Rrrrg---!!!!”</p><p><i>W-Why… is 
this so hard?! I can barely move forward now!</i></p><p>She raised her arms and gritted her 
teeth. Now nearly at the top, she threw in her entire weight and silently prayed for the 
breakthrough…</p><p><i>Come…ON!</i></p><p>…Her prayer was 
granted.</p><p><b>TUP!</b></p><p>In the second she crossed the invisible line marking the 
entranceway a peculiar sensation washed over her. It was damp and cold, as if she were 
caught in a foggy mist. With the slightest of movements the breeze pricked at her arms and 
caused the hairs on the back of her neck to stand on end—a low, whispery voice rumbled 
through the dark, beckoning to her once more. Was it only the wind that stirred such 
frightening imagination from the warrior? It somehow felt similar to the time that she 
followed Apollo’s spectre through the streets; there were hollowed whispers in her ears. 
However, this time, they were closer now and more real.</p><p><i>I can’t hear 
you…</i></p><p>…<i>I can’t hear her voice anymore…</i></p><p>Rei’s eyes dimmed, unknowingly 
surrendering to the force that desired her presence. All thought of the others vanished in a 
hazy cloud: The danger of the situation, the urgency of their mission, the risks and 
sacrifices that led her existence here, and even the fiery determination to find Hotaru 
became extinguished like a candle in the breeze. Instead, she was assaulted by loneliness in 
this warped world.</p><p><i>Where am I?</i></p><p>…<i>Who am I…?</i></p><p>… <i>Where should 
I go...?</i></p><p>As if to answer her, an invisible hand lightly gripped one of her own and 
gently tugged her towards the corridor.</p><p>“This way...?” Rei stepped towards the 
direction after the mysterious guide. “Are you sure?”</p><p>The fears and problems of the 
outside world fell away, leaving the woman’s soul feeling light and unburdened; inwardly, 
wrapped within the warm, mesmerizing sensation, she was entranced and dangerously 
dancing.</p><p>The muddled shape of her guide momentarily flickered before her eyes before 
hiding itself within the invisible unknown. The resemblance of a long, flowing dress at the 
specter’s feet tickled something within her memory. But similar to that of the specter, as 
soon as it was sighted it was gone.</p><p><u>(Sun Palace, Corridor)</u></p><p>Rei ventured 
deeper into the maze at the insistence of her patient guide. The corridor that she walked 
down now was solely lit by two rows of candles. Her shadow spun behind her, continually 
being battered around by the orange light. It was almost like a game. A child, who has lost 
their way, takes the advice of a wandering stranger. The stranger’s true face is unknown and 
their true purpose is fleeting like the playful wind. However, the child takes irrational 
comfort in this presence and allows only the thought of curiosity to fuel his/her urge to 
explore the unknown.</p><p>‘This entire place is strange…’ Rei’s senses flickered alive long 
enough to recognize the floating lights that have now appeared within the 
corridor.</p><p>“Who are you?” The question escaped her lips.</p><p>The guide in front of 
her became momentarily visible once more. Not only did the Martian note the dress from the 
person’s backside, but this time she also caught the sight of long-braided 
hair.</p><p>…<i>What…?</i></p><p>Her host disappeared from sight once more.</p><p><u>(Palace 
Ballroom)</u></p><p>Rei finally reached an enormous room. It was almost entirely dark with 
exception of the lights that floated aimlessly about the surroundings. Somehow, she found 
herself suddenly feeling sad; the emotion was particularly strong within this area.</p><p>As 
her guide’s presence disappeared entirely from detection, Rei’s heart began to speed up 
again. The drowsy, mind-numbing peace was lifted, and delivered the woman to the waiting 
jaws of inner turmoil. Instantly consciousness clenched down hard for control and she 
snapped out of her stupor.</p><p>“W-What?” Rei blinked and stumbled backwards in sudden 
awareness. She stared, wide-eyed at the unfamiliar surroundings.</p><p><i>How did I get 
here? Where is this place?</i></p><p>Her head hurt as though someone ripped her out of a 
pleasant dream and abandoned her in a hellish nightmare. She was alone. She understood that 
much. Yet she took no comfort in the presence of her new companions. The floating entities, 
though they lit the surroundings for her, it was because of them that a sense of uneasiness 
formed in the pit of her stomach.</p><p><i>Those things--! I remember seeing them on the 
Moon! But… what are they doing here? What are they?!</i></p><p>The whispers started again. 
This time, however, they were not muffed. They were so clear that Rei could not mistake them 
for anything else, no matter how hard she wished.</p><p>“…<i>Run…”</i></p><p>“…<i>way… away… 
Run!”</i></p><p>“…<i>ey… com… ing…”</i></p><p>“… <i>Run!”</i></p><p>“R-Run…? Run from what?” 
The Martian nervously stepped back when the lights began to furiously buzz and emit 
high-pitched screams.</p><p><b>Tup, tup--Thud.</b></p><p><i>What?</i></p><p>Rei 
automatically looked down at her feet to see what she stumbled into. A small, circular plate 
caught her gaze. With dangerous curiosity she allowed her eyes to trail along the lines that 
spread out from the tiny plate, stepping back only to gain a better view, and she nearly 
choked on the very air she breathed.</p><p><i>It can’t be! </i> Her heart was pounding 
loudly in her ears.</p><p><b>Lubb Dubb! Lubb Dubb! Lubb Dubb!</b></p><p><i>A 
dragon.</i></p><p>The seal of a two-headed dragon stared menacingly up at her. Her earlier 
dream instantly came to mind as the beast’s eyes began to shine crimson. A loud roar caught 
in her ears. Rei gasped and leapt back when a stream of black fire shot out of the crest and 
curled up to confront the intruder.</p><p>“…A-ah…” She had taken a defensive position but 
the magnitude of its spiritual pressure was overwhelming. It felt like she couldn’t 
move.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>Footsteps echoed in the hallway behind 
her.</p><p><i>It’s the others! No! Don’t come any closer!</i> She wanted to cry out, but the 
words refused to form on her lips.</p><p>From the corner of her eyes she sighted the group 
appear at the doorway entrance. They all just stopped short of entering the room, only 
noticing the fiery creature when Rei’s peculiar paralysis drew their attention to the evil 
aura permeating the chamber.</p><p>“Rei?! Rei, get away from there!” Minako 
screamed.</p><p><i>I’m trying! But my body won’t move--!</i> The Martian struggled against 
the invisible bonds but they held fast. They wrapped about her arms and legs, and head to 
toe, restricting every possible movement. If her mouth were open she wouldn’t be able to 
tell if she were screaming because even breathing was even a mystery to her at this point; 
every nerve in her body felt shot and her limbs were rapidly going numb. The helplessness 
she was subjected to made her tremble.</p><p><i>Damn it!</i></p><p>With the last bit of her 
will, she glared defiantly at her captor as the dragon lunged down and swallowed her with 
its being.</p><p><b>SHROOOOM!</b></p><p>“REI!!!!!”</p><p>“Minako, don’t--!” Haruka made a 
grab for the Venusian, only to narrowly miss her arm. “I said stop!”</p><p>The second the 
two rulers stepped closer into the room two black hands shot forward from the gooey mess on 
the floor where their friend had been and wrapped around their waists. Their arms were 
trapped at their sides.</p><p>“Dammit! L-Let go!” Haruka snarled.</p><p>“Haruka!” Michiru 
raced forward. She raised her arms. “Deep… 
SUBMERGE!”</p><p><b>Whiiiiiiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrr</b></i><b>---KABLAM!!!!</b></p><p>“Sparking…Wide 
Pressure!”</p><p>“Shine…Aqua 
Illusion!”</p><p><b>Sssssss----KABLAM!</b></p><p><b>KABLAM!</b></p><p>The substance between 
the hands and their gooey base were blown away in the blast, while the remainder, the hands, 
dropped lifelessly to the floor and shrivelled up like a plant due to a lack of 
moisture.</p><p>“Did… did we get it?” Makoto dared to ask.</p><p>“Who cares?!” Minako 
emotionally snapped back. “Rei… What happened to her?!”</p><p><i>I could only watch as that 
monster came down on her! Why didn’t I move? It’s my fault! It’s my fault! If only I had 
stopped her! If only I had come sooner! If only…I had done something! This wouldn’t have 
happened…</i></p><p>“She can’t be dead! REEEEEEEEEI!!!!!!”</p><p>“…Minako…” Haruka’s averted 
her gaze. <i>Rei--!!</i> It was too painful to look at the Venusian. It was too painful to 
think that her friend could possibly...</p><p>A squirming movement suddenly caught Haruka’s 
eye. The gigantic black mass began to move again.</p><p>“Minako, look out!”</p><p>“Wha---- 
AHHHHHH!” She was thrown up into the air and held there.</p><p>“Shit! TAKE IT DOWN!” Uranus 
barely raised her hand to initiate a world shaking when something grabbed her arm and pulled 
her backwards. She let out a stream of curses as the shadows leapt upon her.</p><p>“DAMN 
IT!”</p><p>“Haruka!”</p><p>“...Haruka!”</p><p>However, in the end, their struggles amounted 
to nothing. Minako watched helplessly as, one by one, her friends were swallowed up and met 
the identical fate that Rei had. They just disappeared. Their muffled cries and struggles 
became stilled under the blanket of darkness that stole them away.</p><p><i>Why is this so 
useless?!</i> Minako wanted to scream. Her torn heart was ripped into pieces, and those 
pieces into pieces. The sludge had gotten a hold of her as well; any second now, it would be 
over.</p><p><i>Why?! Why?! WHY?!</i></p><p><b>Sheeeeeeeeeen…</b></p><p>She was distracted 
when crimson light lit the area. The blonde turned her head in time to see the thin outline 
of someone familiar at the doorway, just before she met her fate as well.</p><p><i>Who is 
that---? Setsuna?!</i></p><p>“You will not have 
them!”</p><p><b>FLAAAAAAAASSSH!</b></p><p><u>(Haruka)</u></p><p>…</p><p>In the darkness, 
Haruka’s consciousness began to awaken.</p><p>…<i>It’s… so quiet…</i></p><p>…<i>Am I 
dead…?</i></p><p>She sighed and inhaled deeply. The cold air filled her shaky lungs like a 
newborn taking breath for the first time. The events that led up to her existence as it was 
now reflected themselves poorly within her dull green eyes; they were a jumbled swirl of 
images, barely capable of influencing her weak thoughts. Her recollection began with fear. 
She remembered the pain and horror of seeing those close to her fall one by one. Looking at 
it all now, like this, she had to wonder if it was all a dream, or a trick of the 
imagination to fill a void with heroic deeds to satisfy the need to be something to 
someone.</p><p>… <i>When I was a child, I never believed in Apollo…</i></p><p>… <i>I could 
never believe that there was a God who ruled other Gods…</i></p><p><i>I thought that he was 
a myth, a story to scare little children who were gullible enough to believe it. Even Ares, 
when he murdered Neptune, I deluded myself to believe that the God of War was only a fool 
who had allowed his bloodlust to take over him…</i></p><p><i>But then…I met Hotaru on 
Saturn. I remember her eyes, they were full of innocence. She looked up at me shyly, and 
took my hand with only one question.</i></p><p>“<i>Who are you?”</i></p><p><i>I was amazed 
that a child could possibly live on such a poisonous planet. No ordinary human could last in 
a place like that. Even I had trouble. It nearly killed me just stepping onto that forsaken 
ground. But there she was. She was real.</i></p><p><i>I saw many things as I met with Rei 
and the others again. I also lost many things as well. Important things…</i></p><p><i>But 
now… it’s so peaceful! I don’t have to think, I don’t need to fight… I can keep my eyes 
closed and dream, and 
sleep…</i></p><p><b>WhoooOOOOooosssh…</b></p><p><i>Hm?</i></p><p><i>What’s that sound? Is 
that...the ocean? It’s strange, but… I can hear the ocean and the wind. Now that I think 
about it, I think, Michiru took me to see it once. It was the largest body of water that 
I’ve ever seen in my entire life. It was really beautiful, and calming. The light would 
reflect off of the water’s surface, and Michiru’s eyes would light up at the sight of it. 
She loves it very much…</i></p><p><i>She was always there for 
me…</i></p><p>“<i>Haruka.”</i></p><p>…<i>Michiru…</i></p><p><i>Where is she? Michiru, where 
are you? Are you all right where you are right now? Is… everyone all right with you? Rei, 
what happened to her? She was… The same thing happened to me, so are we 
both…?</i></p><p><i>We all worked so hard, and came this far together! So, even if I’m… if I 
am… I can’t give up now. There must be something I can do! I’ll find a way to fight 
somehow!</i></p><p><i>I won’t let you guys do this alone!</i></p><p>“...ruka… Haruka, wake 
UP!”</p><p>At the sound of an insistent voice, the sounds of the ocean died away only to 
leave behind the roar of the wind-- a powerful wind that re-ignited the flame within 
Haruka’s body and made the senses known once more. The rush of blood throughout her body 
confirmed one thing, if not the most important; she was still alive. However, if this was a 
temporarily granted life she didn’t know.</p><p>The wind ruler peeked through heavy lids and 
allowed her vision to adjust. She saw long green hair, crimson eyes and a staff with a red 
jewel on its end.</p><p>“…Set…suna…?”</p><p>“Wake up already.” The other woman was huffing 
for breath. Beads of sweat littered her brow as she heavily leaned onto her staff for 
support. “You have no time to lie around.”</p><p>In an instant Haruka pushed herself up to 
her feet, testing the weight on her legs for a moment, and eyed her surroundings. It did 
nothing to help the confusion welling up inside of her.</p><p>“Huh? Where are we?” <i>It’s 
so dark. I can’t see anything! </i>She turned her attention to her comrade. “And what 
happened to you? You look terrible! Tell it to me straight, Setsuna. Is this another one of 
your visions or did we both die?”</p><p>Setsuna remained silent a few seconds longer, 
gathering breath to calm down her shaky body.</p><p>“No, we are both alive. However, that 
could change very quickly if we aren’t careful. We have been dragged into the spiritual 
realm. This place is a graveyard, a spiritual graveyard to be precise.”</p><p>“What?! N-No 
way! So just what are you saying? We’re alive but we’re stuck in another 
dimension?”</p><p>She nodded. “I first noticed this while I was in the Venusian shuttle. The 
machinery was detecting abnormal spiritual readings aggregating around the City, and they 
were far greater than the normal standard. Do you understand what this means?”</p><p>“…No, 
I’m afraid not.”</p><p>“Spiritual energy originates from the soul. The more souls gathered 
within an area, the greater the spiritual levels of that area. Such is the case where 
spirits rest or sites where people have passed away before their time. This is important, 
Haruka. Normally it is impossible for a specter to affect the living under normal 
conditions… however, as the spiritual levels of a place rise, so does the potential for a 
specter to influence the living world. The place you and I are trapped in now is extremely 
dangerous! Here, it is very possible for a spirit to take your life!”</p><p>“So, you 
mean--?! This place is crawling with ghosts?!” <i>Again?! Oh no...I hate 
ghosts...</i></p><p>“Yes. It appears that it was Apollo’s intention all along. While he is a 
spirit himself, he cannot touch us unless he influences someone of the living to do his 
bidding for him or unless he encounters us in an area such as this. His creation expands as 
far as the battlefield, where his minions are granted the ability to multiply at abnormal 
rates. That was just the first level though. The second spiritual level was staged at the 
palace entrance… while we are currently standing at the third, the deepest, and where his 
powers are the strongest.”</p><p><i>I never expected him to go this far. To imagine that he 
was capable of amassing enough souls to perform such a feat!</i></p><p>“Based on the 
strengths of the signatures that I currently detect, many of these souls are likely from the 
Great War long ago. The majority are common foot-soldiers. However, there are also large 
masses that are significantly weaker… Therefore it is plausible to conclude that Apollo has 
gathered many of his deceased former subjects, such as civilians, and has trapped them here 
as well for the sake of achieving his goal.”</p><p>“Former subjects? Seriously?” Haruka 
shivered when a chill ran through her body. Her eyes instantly darted behind her, but to her 
dismay there was no one there.</p><p><i>That’s strange… For a second I thought I sensed 
someone was… Could it be one of the ghosts that Setsuna was just talking about?</i></p><p>“I 
apologize.” Setsuna continued. “I managed to spare you and the others, but I could not 
teleport us out of this dimension. His power is too great now.”</p><p><i>It is also likely… 
that THEY will appear soon as well.</i></p><p>“Wait! So you mean the others are still 
alive?!”</p><p>“There is a strong possibility. By the time I had reached all of you, Apollo 
had already begun to drag you further into this dimension. The best I could do within my 
power was to rip you from his grasp. That is all. As for the others well being, I cannot 
truly say... However, they are alive. They are all scattered somewhere within this realm. 
Listen Haruka, it is imperative that you find each other before he finds you first. 
Otherwise, it will be impossible to defeat him.”</p><p>Setsuna inwardly winced, and her legs 
suddenly felt weak. <i>My powers… I’ve exhausted them past my limit. My body wishes to 
sleep…</i></p><p>“All right then. We’ll find them together!” Haruka nodded to 
herself.</p><p>“We?” Setsuna blink back at the taller woman.</p><p>“Yeah. You just said it 
yourself--it’s dangerous, isn’t it? And in the condition you’re in, I just can’t leave you 
here.” She took a step forward. “Like it or not, I’m taking you with me!”</p><p><b>Lubb 
Dubb</b></p><p><i>Haruka…</i></p><p>“Haruka, I must also warn you. Under any circumstance, 
do not allow a spirit 
to--”</p><p><b>PING!</b></p><p>“…World…”</p><p><b>Sheeeeeeen..</b></p><p>Setsuna’s eyes 
widened. “Haruka, stay back!”</p><p>“What?!” The blonde barely caught the glimpse of golden 
light.</p><p>“…SHAKING!”</p><p><b>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRR—</b></p><p>The attack 
charged towards the wind ruler with terrifying speed!</p><p>Haruka, who was caught off 
guard, barely turned her head to see the oncoming blast before a figure threw themselves in 
front of her.</p><p>“Setsuna!”</p><p><b>BLAM!</b></p><p>“Augh!”</p><p>The advisor’s bloody 
body dropped to the floor, where she continued to writhe in pain.</p><p>“Setsuna! …Setsuna!” 
Haruka dropped to one knee and stared at her comrade in horror and disbelief. She wasn’t 
sure what to do; what just happened?!</p><p>“Come on, say something! Anything!” <i>Where did 
that attack come from? It was my attack, but… I wasn’t the one who initiated 
it!</i></p><p>“Setsuna!”</p><p>“…Haruka. Do not look at me. Always keep focus on your 
opponent--!”</p><p>“My opponent...?”</p><p><b>Tup. Tup. Tup. Tup.</b></p><p>The wind ruler 
turned her head as the footsteps drew nearer; her green eyes trained on the direction, 
flashing with nervous anticipation for what awaited her.</p><p><i>There’s someone 
there.</i></p><p>A golden suit of armor stepped into the light…</p><p><i>There is only one 
other person…</i></p><p>...Followed by blonde hair…</p><p>…<i>.who could use that 
attack.</i></p><p>Haruka swallowed hard as she found empty green eyes staring back at her. 
She wanted to laugh and cry at the same time; she would have never believed such a story if 
it weren’t staring her in the face!</p><p>However, the shred of fleeting joy she harboured 
was torn apart at the sound of Setsuna’s fitful coughs. Bitterness of the deed gave way to 
anger; her entire body tensed and she glared at her former mentor with deep 
contempt.</p><p>“You!” She growled. “How could you do such a thing?!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>To her 
bewilderment, the man merely withdrew his sword and brandished it towards her in a 
threateningly manner.</p><p>“You bastard...!”</p><p>“It’s no use… you cannot get through to 
him.” Setsuna whispered. She felt the urge to uncharacteristically chuckle at this turn of 
events. “It appears... that Apollo could not touch them while he was a spirit. Nor could he 
control them, especially as his powers were already focused on another… Therefore, instead, 
he brought them to him.”</p><p>Haruka slowly absorbed this information.</p><p>“So… because 
spirits can’t affect the living, he killed them all just so he could use them?! Are you 
saying that no matter what I do, I can’t do anything about it because he’s a 
ghost?”</p><p>Setsuna stared the other woman in the eye. Her advice was simple.</p><p>“You 
must defeat him.”</p><p>“But how?! He’s already dead!” She turned her head quickly when 
Uranus began to slowly approach them.</p><p>“He has materialized in order to gain the 
ability to hurt you. Therefore, he also becomes vulnerable to your attacks as well. Defeat 
him, and then house his spirit in your body. If you can temporarily house his spirit then 
Apollo cannot work his magic over him any longer. Also, a last word of caution... Do not 
allow yourself to be hit by his spiritual attacks.”</p><p><i>Avoid being hit by his world 
shaking at all costs!</i></p><p>“You aren’t making any sense!” Haruka rose to her knees and 
took on a defensive position. “What’s the big deal about spiritual attacks? I can just heal 
myself if that happens!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Setsuna…?”</p><p>“…”</p><p><i>Oh no! Please don’t 
tell me----</i></p><p>“Stay with me Setsuna! Try to stay awake!”</p><p>The sound of stomping 
footsteps drew Haruka’s attention to her charging opponent.</p><p>“Just like old times huh?” 
<i>I thought I hated you back then, but now I REALLY hate you...</i></p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></p><p>“HaaaaaaaAAAAAAH!”</p><p>“HAH!”</p><p><b>CLASH!!!!!</b></p><p>Their swords 
met with a spark against metal.</p><p>“Is that all you got?!” She shouted in his 
face.</p><p>Haruka struggled and shoved her sword into his in deadlock. From their close 
proximity she found Setsuna’s words beginning to sink in. No matter which words she threw 
against him, Uranus would not acknowledge them; the former God’s green eyes were hollow and 
tinged with crimson specs as the madness and lack of conscience sank in.</p><p><i>His eyes…! 
I remember, back on that day…</i> She was getting tired of seeing them. <i>Ares had the 
exact same eyes!</i></p><p>“HAH!” Haruka forced him back onto his heels. Immediately, Uranus 
set himself into another world shaking.</p><p>“World… SHAKING!”</p><p><i><b>Wham! 
</b></i><b>Whiiiii</b><i><b>iiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrr</b></i><b>---Blam!</b></p><p>“Heh.”</p><p>Haruka 
stared at him with a confident smirk. His attack collided with her raised blade straight on, 
the metal taking the majority of the force. She had gotten away from the attack with only a 
few minor scratches.</p><p><i>I guess being dead restored his ability to use his powers 
again… but even then, they’re still weak compared to mine! Now, all I have to do is heal 
myself and---</i></p><p><b>Bzz…bzz-!</b></p><p>“…What?” Haruka blinked at the blockage. 
While upholding her defensive position she glanced down at the scrapes on her forearms. The 
cut caused by the world shaking was still there!</p><p>“It’s not healing?!” A chill ran down 
her spine.</p><p>“<i>Do not allow yourself to be hit by his spiritual 
attacks.”</i></p><p>‘Is--Is this what she meant when she told me to be careful?” <i>I see 
now. I can’t heal myself if I get hit by spiritual attacks!</i> <i>But then that means 
Setsuna--!!</i></p><p><i>She won’t be able to heal herself either?!</i></p><p>Haruka lunged 
forward and sent the former God back in a brief exchange of blows. Once she knocked him off 
balance she threw one hand up into the air.</p><p>“Two can play at this game! 
World…”</p><p><b>Sheeeeeen…</b></p><p>“…SHAKING!!!”</p><p><b>WHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIR-----TING!</b></p><p>Uranus 
swatted the golden planet away. But in the moment that he had lost sight of his former 
charge…</p><p>“…”</p><p>A shadow appeared behind him.</p><p>“Right 
here!”</p><p><b>SLASH!</b></p><p>“…!”</p><p>The back plate of the former God’s armor fell 
off, with only a thin red line along his back for proof of injury.</p><p><i>I won’t forgive 
you!</i></p><p>Quickly, Haruka found herself once again exchanging a series of lightning 
fast blows.</p><p><b>Ting! Ting! </b></p><p><b>TinZ!</b></p><p><b>Tinz—clash! 
Tinz—clash!</b></p><p><b>Whup---CLASH!</b></p><p><i>That’s strange…</i> Haruka thought as 
she analyzed her opponent’s awkward movements. <i>He’s not nearly as strong as he used to 
be. He’s slower, and his attacks are sluggish! I know I didn’t hurt him that much with that 
last attack!</i></p><p><i>It’s like he’s not even trying!</i></p><p>Haruka leapt up, and did 
a mid-air somersault. With the momentum of the spin, combined with the force of gravity she 
hurtled a destructive downwards swing towards the man, so fast, leaving Uranus barely enough 
time to raise his sword 
up.</p><p><b>swiish--</b></p><p>“YAH!”</p><p><b>SLASH---CRACKLE!!!</b></p><p>With a single 
swing of her sword, Haruka broke the tip off of Uranus’s weapon. The gleaming piece of metal 
clattered against the ground and signalled her waiting triumph. It was over. All she had to 
do now was to claim it.</p><p>“Pathetic.”</p><p><b>WHUP!</b></p><p>She drilled her fist into 
his mid section, through his armor, and knocked him to the ground. No words could accurately 
describe the outrage she felt now.</p><p>She felt hatred towards him. Yet at the same time, 
she knew it was misplaced. It was Apollo who was at fault for orchestrating this misery that 
they all were forced to endure. Uranus was merely one of his disposable puppets… a puppet, 
in Haruka’s opinion, who should have known better.</p><p>“Just look at you!” She yelled as 
she pointed her blade at him. Her words were difficult to voice due to the urge to clench 
her teeth. “Look at what you’ve become! You mean to tell me that you disappeared from 
everything, from life, only to become this?! That the former God of Uranus, the same man who 
adopted me, has fallen this low and became a puppet for a dead master like a dog?! Where is 
your pride?! I’ve never knew you were such a weak-willed individual!”</p><p>An emotion began 
to flicker within the man’s green eyes.</p><p><i>I came all this way to fight Apollo, to get 
revenge for what he’s done to everyone, including you. But when I came here, I found you. 
For a moment, I almost hoped you were still alive. I wanted to ask you many things that I 
couldn’t before… But instead, I had to fight you… and… even then, it still wasn’t even 
you!</i></p><p><i>I hate him. Apollo… I hate him, I hate him, I hate him!</i></p><p>“The 
soldiers of Uranus are strong willed individuals who fight with honour and respect! We fight 
to protect our home and our comrades! What we do not do, however, is bow down and whimper 
like dogs for an undeserving master! That-- is not Uranus’s way!” She 
roared.</p><p>…<i>!</i></p><p>Haruka threw her arms up into the air and began to concentrate 
a world shaking.</p><p>“World…”</p><p><i>I can’t believe it’s come to 
this.</i></p><p>Instead of throwing the glowing planet into the ground, she merged the ball 
of light into her blade!</p><p><b>Sheeeeeeeen…</b></p><p><i>But if I must destroy with my 
own hands to rescue you from that demon’s grasp, then I will! I won’t let him have 
you!</i></p><p>She swung down!</p><p><i>I… remember 
you…</i></p><p>“Haruka.”</p><p>“…SHAKING!”</p><p><b>KABLAAAAAAAM!</b></p><p>Uranus’s 
temporary body dispersed into a flurry of white lights. Although there was no blood or a 
dying scream, the grateful smile that reached his lips as her sword came down was framed 
perfectly in her memory. He had recognized her. He acknowledged her, even if only for a 
split second. That flicker of joy was all she truly wanted when she was still an heir. 
However, as the lights flitted past her darkened face she recalled another possible end for 
another comrade. Rei was alive, a fact which brought her great relief. But the cut on her 
forearm, though relatively harmless to her, meant life or death to another.</p><p>Her 
thoughts were interrupted when a single, glowing sphere of light remained. It floated an 
arms-reach away in front of her, almost expectantly.</p><p>“Is that really you?” Haruka 
questioned it.</p><p>“<i>Defeat him, and then house his spirit in your body. If you can 
temporarily house his spirit then Apollo cannot work his magic over him any longer.” 
</i></p><p>“Setsuna…”</p><p>Haruka briefly glanced at the advisor’s body. This time there 
was no hesitation or doubt. She then outstretched her hand towards the entity, inviting it 
to her. There was a brief flash of light as Uranus’s sphere merged with her, and then 
disappeared. Warmth immediately spread throughout Haruka’s limbs, removing the pain from her 
tense muscles.</p><p>With a heavy heart, the wind ruler then walked over to her injured 
partner.</p><p>“Hey. Hey!” She called her, half-hoping, half-believing that she’d still get 
a response. “Wake up!”</p><p>Haruka almost couldn’t resist smiling when those crimson eyes 
wearily fluttered open.</p><p>“You can’t fall asleep.” She lectured as she took a seat 
beside her. “If you do, you might not wake up.”</p><p>“Haruka…” Setsuna analyzed the 
blonde’s face with a stern expression. Did she not understand yet?</p><p>Haruka heavily 
sighed. “Yeah, I found out,” she pointed to the cut on her arm. “So… no matter what I do, 
it’s really no good huh?”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure that 
nothing can be done?! It doesn’t matter what it is, if it’ll help you, I’ll do 
it!”</p><p>The emotionless expression that resumed on Setsuna’s face brought sparked anger 
in Haruka.</p><p><i>Doesn’t she care at all?!</i> Against her nagging pride she held up her 
hands, palms facing down, over the advisor and concentrated on releasing her 
aura.</p><p>“…?!” Setsuna’s eyes flew open. “Haruka, I’ve already told you! Spiritual wounds 
inflicted by spirits cannot be healed by the living.”</p><p>“Shut up. I don’t want to hear 
any crap from you right now!” She snapped. Her frustration was beginning to shine through 
her mask of irritation.</p><p>“But why…”</p><p>“Look, I know this probably won’t work, but 
I’m going to try anyway, dammit! So don’t you even think about giving up! No matter what, 
you have to try everything you can or it’s already over!”</p><p>Setsuna’s body shivered. Her 
body felt so cold. “… I’ve… under-estimated my opponent. I was foolish…and this is the 
price… that I must pay. That is the reality of war.”</p><p>“Stop talking like that!” The 
blonde growled. “You don’t deserve to die just because you made a mistake! There are a lot 
of people who care about you! What about Artemis and Luna? What about the rest of us?! Have 
you forgotten about that? Or, are you always in your own little world being too depressed to 
see what’s around you?!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve always hated about you. You 
always go off and pity yourself for every little thing that goes wrong!” <i>Everything that 
I’ve said… You try to do everything by yourself.</i> “Everything can’t be decided by logic 
alone!”</p><p>Haruka’s hands shook as the energy continued to leave her. She knew the wounds 
weren’t healing, she was painfully aware of it.</p><p>“Stop, that’s enough.” Setsuna gripped 
onto her hands with tremendous effort. “You are… exhausting yourself for 
nothing.”</p><p>“It’s not for nothing! I’m doing this for you!”</p><p>“!”</p><p>The strain 
on Haruka’s body was beginning to take its toll on her, but she refused to let up. Setsuna 
was still alive as far as she was concerned, even if it was just barely. It hurt to watch 
those bright crimson eyes become dim, to see the life going out with it, and because of 
what? Why was she even in this position in the first place?</p><p><i>She lost her energy 
saving us. If only we’d been more careful! If I’d only been more careful, she wouldn’t 
be…</i></p><p>Haruka clenched her teeth and tried not to cry. She disliked the other woman, 
but not this much. Not enough to want her to die. In her mind, she knew it would be any time 
now.</p><p>“…Setsuna…thank you.”</p><p>“…?”</p><p>“I know this is kind of late. But hear me 
out, all right? You were always there looking out for us. And although we hardly talked… we 
all still considered you as part of our family, even if only for a short while. We trusted 
you. You were reliable and always seemed to know what to do when we didn’t. And I…I’m sorry 
that I said all those mean things to you…” Haruka flinched at the tug on her powers. She was 
tiring out.</p><p>“You did good, all right? So don’t let a little mistake make you think 
that everything is messed up now, because it’s not! You got us this far! So, we’ll keep 
going! We’ll defeat Apollo no matter what!”</p><p>Setsuna’s eyes were only open a crack now. 
Her world was already darkening.</p><p><i>I never thought that this day would come, that I 
would finally die. How long as it been now? I cannot even remember my own birth. The days 
are almost all the same to me. I merely kept on living and watching as those important to me 
faded away. I had no power to save any of them…</i></p><p><i>Maybe, all of this time… I 
wished for death. I’ve longed to be with her…</i></p><p><i>Yet, it is strange… to be dying, 
like this. Knowing, that you were loved... It almost makes me wish… I 
could…</i></p><p><i>Live.</i></p><p>“…Thank…you…”</p><p>“!” Haruka watched as Setsuna’s eyes 
closed and her body went limp. In that instant, from the peaceful smile on her face, she 
knew the struggle was over.</p><p>Shakily, she ceased her efforts and allowed her hands to 
fall to the ground in front of her with the knowledge that she tried until the very end. It 
still hurt though; to know that your best wasn’t good enough. Despite her earlier promise 
not to cry, she found her eyes tearing up. Two smiles, two precious smiles of gratitude that 
she didn’t deserve: One for bringing the end to her mentor, and the other… the happiness and 
the faith in Setsuna’s eyes that said ‘I believe you’ when her efforts still allowed her to 
die.</p><p><b>Plip, plip…</b></p><p><i>I’ll beat him for you… I swear it! I won’t rest until 
I do! We’ll take that bastard down!</i></p><p><i>I 
promise!</i></p><p>“AHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!”</p><p><b><hr></b></p><p><b>Next up in HFD, Ch.
