<h1>A Second Chance</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/mysticmew.html">MysticMew</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Quietly I slipped away from the group starring off into the horizon 
after the departing shooting stars. The battle was finally over. 
Galaxia cleansed and Chaos had retreated. Peace once again was 
established, once again due to our bright star of hope, our princess. 
And yet, I did not feel very much like celebrating. The general mood 
had been depressed actually and I believe the Outers had to have 
similar feelings.
	What the princess didn&#39;t know - if Mamoru hadn&#39;t told her 
yet - was, that our absence hadn&#39;t been so smoothly as we had assured 
our savior. She wouldn&#39;t have understood, wouldn&#39;t have been happy to 
hear it. The truth of the matter was, being reduced to your Sailor 
Crystal left you quite unprotected, all emotional and mental shields 
you protected yourself from the outside world with were non-existent. 
I could only speak from my own memories but I guess, the others were 
not better off.
	I had been... aware. That much I&#39;m sure about. I was even 
aware of who I was etc., but there was no body, no linking whatsoever 
to the world around me. The only thing that defined my existence was 
the ocean of star seeds around me and the emotions from the closest 
ones around me. No, not only emotions. Memories. Our deepest, best 
hidden, darkest memories. Those that defined, shaped our mortal 
lives, made us who we were. I had received glimpses from all of them. 
Rei&#39;s childhood from the time when her mother died and her father 
didn&#39;t take the responsibility he damn well should have, Ami living 
through the worst times before the divorce of her parents. Makoto 
upon receiving the news of the plane crash in which her parents 
died... That had to be one of the worst. Even memories from the 
Outers and Mamoru had been mixed into it. And everything was packed 
into a massive onslaught of unyielding dark emotions. It was terrible.
	All that though, wasn&#39;t the worst. The worst and the clearest 
memories and emotions I had received from only one of my fellow 
comrades. It had made the rest appear unworthy and hollow compared to 
the deep experiences I had received from... her. I had been aware 
that her past was probably the worst of all of us, I wouldn&#39;t have 
needed the memories to confirm that. However, I was unprepared for 
the exact nature of her emotional pain. I had never imagined that it 
would run THAT deep. People who judged a person from the outside, 
from appearance, were dumb, I knew that already, but everyone knowing 
her, REALLY knowing her, would instinctively reach out to protect the 
girl. Yet, nobody did know her. I doubted that even Pluto did quite 
so well as I did now. And as a result, the world just saw what they 
wanted. Prejudices were one thing but that, that... I couldn&#39;t really 
find a word for it.
	I headed towards the fountain in one of those countless parks 
of Tokyo. I knew she would be here. Don&#39;t ask me how, I just did.

My steps were quick and purposeful, definitely not the ones that 
should belong to the child I appeared to be for the world around me. 
Not the small steps of a little girl who would falter in her straight 
course over and over again, to satisfy her curiosity about one thing 
or another. No, that was not me. It was just a shell, a mask, a 
protection for my soul. It was useless now, becoming useless, to her 
at least. I had nothing to hide anymore, didn&#39;t need to hide anymore 
and couldn&#39;t hide anymore. Because she knew already. Everything. The 
whole, terrific truth. As much as I knew hers.
	She was there as expected, blonde hair swaying in the evening 
wind, the last sun beams of the day bathing her in a beautiful 
display of shadow and light through the water of the fountain. Blue 
eyes searched mine the moment I stepped into sight and I didn&#39;t 
hesitate to meet the gaze. Sad, compassionate, hesitant, unsure of 
what to do now. I walked the remaining distance at a slower pace, not 
caring about onlookers while my body began to shift and my form to 
grow until it matched hers. She watched intently, transfixed by the 
transformation, her eyes lingering on the older body. I think, we 
were the same age now.
	When we met in front of the fountain, the sounds around us 
faded into the background and further away as time passed. Standing 
still for an eternity, we remained as we were. Our bodies inches 
apart, one of her hands hovering on my arm, my head upwards so that 
my eyes could still see hers as she looked down - I was still 
slightly shorter but I didn&#39;t mind. These blue eyes so full of life 
and yet so deeply filled with loneliness. The craving for one who 
could fill this special place in her heart, the longing for the end 
of the suffering, I all knew what it meant, where it came from. And 
it was directed at me right now. Me alone.
	Neither of us moved, neither dared to move, as we probably 
both recalled the fated moment only hours ago. A moment only for us. 
One timeless moment.

---Flashback---
Bright sunlight penetrated my eyes forcing them to blink in 
irritation and to close just as quickly. Taking my time, I tried to 
readjust to my surroundings, wondering there I was. I felt physically 
rooted again but at the same time it was different. Nothing made much 
sense and I chose to undergo the simple task of taking in my 
surroundings.
	I was in a palace of some sorts. The stone was a brilliant 
orange-gold color. Wide archways, giant pillars and at the same time 
soft-looking as well as massive-appearing statues and sculptures were 
gracing the walls. I was outside in a garden, I think. Although the 
simple term &quot;garden&quot; bore a hidden note of blasphemy, judged by the 
variety of flowers. A bed of roses, lilies, daisies, orchids and 
many, many other that I didn&#39;t even recognize. Some surely didn&#39;t 
even bloom on Earth, some might even not in the huge gardens of the 
old Moon Kingdom. A huge bird of golden stone sat atop the outside 
world, its wings spread wide and it prepared to screech. A truly, 
magnificent sight. This place bore memories though I could not tell 
which.
	My mind was still to jumbled to sort through all the 
experiences I had just shared, all the emotions weighing down on my 
already heavy soul, all the memories tormenting my strained spirit. 
If not for the one, constant one, I don&#39;t believe, I could have kept 
sane. I had grabbed onto that one experience like a lifeline. Where 
had been something I could deeply identify with, sympathize with. I 
could understand loneliness, I could share it, that was something I 
knew all too well. The other memories were simply distracting.
	&quot;Where am I?&quot; I wondered out loud, not really expecting an 
answer. I couldn&#39;t get the nagging sense out of my mind, that I 
should know this place, as if it was... home. Home? Something about 
this word warmed me, thinking about it and linking it to the 
surrounding, I felt almost content with life right now. I could 
happily die now that I was here. &quot;In the atmosphere of Venus. That is 
the Magellan Palace.&quot;
	My head snapped around and I saw HER standing there, leaning 
against the wall, directly under the huge bird statue. I expected her 
to wear an orange gown, appropriate for the place and time. But there 
was none. There was nothing actually. She was nude, only a pair of 
golden wings - just like Sailor Moon&#39;s - folded around her birthday&#39;s 
body. With a start, I realized that I wasn&#39;t wearing anything either. 
Only the comforting blanket of my own ebony black wings.
	Hesitant I walked over to her, her eyes following my movement 
carefully, not leaving my form for a fleeting moment. Patient and 
tranquil, waiting for me to reach her. And when I finally did, when I 
joined her under the protective area of the bird, the... Suiwa... 
When I did that and our eyes met, blue on purple, everything suddenly 
made sense. So much horrible sense.
	&quot;Do you remember?&quot; she asked tentatively, softly. I could 
only nod. I did remember. Oh, how much I did remember. Everything was 
suddenly so clear. As if something had cut the shell away and left 
only clarity. The one memory that mattered, the one that answered all 
the questions, solved all the problems, made everything as it should 
be, the one that hurt oh so much... There were no names, only faces, 
actions, lives. But no names, I did not know why that was, why that 
was the only thing left undiscovered. Maybe it was for the best. The 
memories were enough anyway. Names would just further confuse us, 
force us to ask who we were now. We still knew who we were... in this 
life... and maybe the one before. And now we knew what we were back 
then. Still, without the names, we at least were us now. Just us. Not 
me, not her, just us.
	&quot;Yeah...&quot; I replied quietly, reaching up to touch her cheek, 
playing with my fingers over the soft skin, oh so familiar yet 
different. Golden, feathered wings opened and enfolded me without a 
word, without a sound. We didn&#39;t need sounds, we didn&#39;t need anything 
for what we were doing. The actions were natural, simple and almost 
as old as time itself. Or so it seemed to me. My black wings joined 
her golden ones in a cocoon that enfolded us in a protective glow. As 
it had been all that time ago. Lifetimes back, then it all started.
	Her hands were cupping my face now, staring deep into my 
eyes. A mixture of all sorts of emotions swirled into those blue orbs 
and for a moment there, I actually believed they briefly flashed 
golden. I felt my heart clench at the familiar sight and my usual 
calm was already melted away the moment I had set eyes on her. My 
sweet Goddess. Not trusting the silence and the seemingly endless 
moment anymore, I put my arms around her neck and pulled her forward. 
Lips met in a fierce, desperate, hopeful, longing kiss that was 
filled with the craving of millennia over millennia of living with a 
cruel, painful curse that we had been unaware of for so long, a 
loneliness fueled and never really satisfied over all this time, 
filled with the feelings that were just reserved for us. Us and 
nobody else. Everything what mattered was the other, everything that 
was of importance was us. Again. Finally.
	Lips parting, I gazed up at the simple, unyielding eternal 
love gazing down at me, healing my long-tortured heart with just this 
one look, simply that love, from her. I did not know what exactly was 
happening, why it happened now or if we were ever going to leave here 
again. But I had to know, because if we would leave, I would not 
leave without her. Never again. Never, ever again.
	&quot;Is this Heaven?&quot; I asked. The moment the words left my lips 
everything went wide and we heard the calling of our hope. Yet, I 
certainly didn&#39;t know, if I really wanted to go. We had no chance 
though.
---End Flashback---

A long time ago, several dozen lifetimes before the here and now, 
when this solar system was still no more than an infant, there was a 
time of innocence, of absolute peace. Before the galaxy knew of the 
Star Seeds, Sailor Crystals and Sailor Senshi, before the creatures 
of existence knew of the endless war between Order and Chaos, the 
constant struggle between Good and Evil.
	Upon this time, we had lived the first time, our first 
lifetime. I had been raised as the actually first princess of my 
planet. She had been there as long as I could think. We grew up as 
sisters but we were not. We were much more than that, much more than 
sisters - even by blood - could ever be. We were, as simple as it 
sounds, harmony. Two innocent girls from the same basic roots of the 
same, oldest tribe of the human species. We were pure, innocent and 
perfect for each other.
	Then... Chaos had come and everything was shattered. The 
first Sailor Senshi were discovered. Senshi all over the galaxy, just 
like us. However, by then the inevitable had already occurred, the 
expected had transpired and there was no going back anymore. We had 
fallen in love. And that was when we learned the hard way, that the 
universe was a cruel place. Not the shiny, peaceful world that we had 
grown up in. But a harsh, painful and cold reality. I was a Senshi, 
she was another. The first was okay, the second not. Not then it 
meant we were together.
	They forced us apart, didn&#39;t grant us our love, declined us 
the right of decision. Her power was too dangerous they said... They 
didn&#39;t even know. How could they know? How SHOULD they know? Who gave 
them the RIGHT to decide? They sealed her away and to make sure 
something like that would never happen again, cursed us. They cursed 
us both to never find true love again. And it was right. We never did 
find TRUE love again over all the following lifetimes because the 
only true love there ever was for us, was the other. And she was 
unreachable.
	I did understand now. All the time I had thought Adonis to be 
right and he was. I had fought it, with all my heart, and yet I had 
never succeeded. In the end he had been right, but ironically instead 
of it being his fault as I always thought, he merely stated a fact. 
It had been her all along I was searching. Her, the only one that 
could free me, the only one that could break the seal to my heart. 
And yet, even then we met the first time, I had not recognized her. 
We had not realized what we were for each other. We had to die first 
to break the curse placed upon us by the oh so wise elders of our 
times for a crime as beautiful and innocent as love. In the end, it 
did not matter. We had found each other again. Here and now.
	&quot;No,&quot; I whispered, responding to the question she had asked, 
right before we left, &quot;this is our second chance. Just like we hoped 
for.&quot; Tilting her chin up a little more with one hand, I put the 
other around her waist and pulled her close for a kiss of ageless 
quality. The first real, physical kiss for us in millennia, the first 
one in our new lives here. It was truly beautiful how such a tiny 
gesture of affection could cause reactions like this. I felt truly 
reborn. Reborn in a new life, with a new hope and with her at my 
side, always, forever. There would be nothing and nobody again who 
could separate us. Nobody should be stupid enough to dare, not with 
all this time we had waited. Waited for this new chance, this second 
time we met, as friends like the first time and then growing into 
something more. Something far more beautiful. Our stars were shining 
again. Together. Brighter than ever, brighter than they ever could 
alone. We had wished for it and finally the wish had been granted. 
The endless suffering had found an end. And anything else didn&#39;t 
matter anymore.
	I could have stood there forever, never letting go, never 
leaving this comfortable space that was my heart&#39;s safest place. 
Right there, with her, nowhere else either of us wanted to be. Never 
again. Everything around us was of no importance. The people staring, 
whispering about how it wasn&#39;t proper to show affection in public, 
especially between two girls. What did they know? They were hiding, 
were afraid from the purity that love created. That is why they were 
making up stupid rules. They were afraid to get hurt, like we did. 
But we had overcome the tasks destiny had confronted us with. We had 
come out victorious in the end because we had always believed. That 
you and I would see each other again in the same way we once had. We 
had believed and the belief finally became reality.
	I finally broke the contact, pushing the smaller girl away to 
be able to see in her face again. The happiness radiating from it was 
enough for another thousand lifetimes, however, this time I would 
keep it. Right here, with me. Near me, always. Because I needed her 
there. My light, my soul, my heart, my confidence, my eternal star 
always shining to lead me back to her. All that she was. It did not 
matter who we were, had been or are now. We were simply two stars 
that were in love. Once we had names that had brought us together the 
first time, destined to meet, destined for each other. However, even 
when we did not remember them. We were us. Her and me. Me and her. 
Venus and Saturn, Aino Minako and Tomoe Hotaru, it did not matter. A 
second chance was given to us today and we would use it because... 
Like they say: Love conquers all, right? It certainly was true in our 
case.
	&quot;Aishiteru,&quot; I said, just like her, at the same time. I took 
her hand and started to leave. &quot;Let&#39;s go...&quot; She gripped my hand 
tightly and I drew her closer to me as we walked into the sunset. It 
had only been a minute or two since we met under the fountain, but so 
much had changed. Clearly for the better.
	&quot;Yes,&quot; she finished, &quot;towards a new future.&quot;

THE END

Author&#39;s Notes

Yes, okay that was a bit sappy, right? I can&#39;t help since I was just 
in the right mood for a little short story (when this happens, it 
usually does on Friday afternoons...). I could probably blame Ayrki 
after reading something similar from her but I won&#39;t since I had the 
idea to do this even before I read hers.
I hope you liked this little piece of work. The whole thing is 
especially for my standards really short and leaves a lot to the 
imagination. This wasn&#39;t meant to be detailed. I left a lot of points 
pretty open for interpretation and will leave them so. You can come 
up with your own theories, I&#39;m sure.
That is actually everything for this one. I hope you enjoyed.

Ja ne, yours
