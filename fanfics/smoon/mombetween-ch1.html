<h1>The Moments Between Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The Palace of Crystal Tokyo was festive as the parties
continued, a celebration of so many things. Lady
Saturn, once known as Hotaru Tomoe, paused by one of
many glittering crystal balcony, the black haired
young woman sipping at a drink. Her black dress hugged
her slim form, her face and hair carefully styled but
her expression was remote as she gazed out at the half
rebuilt city that they now called their home.

&quot;You always seem to move off on your own,&quot; the quiet
voice said. Hotaru turned to see Lady Venus standing
there, the blonde gazing at her with a gentle kind of
sympathy. Minako Aino was wearing in a golden dress,
delicate jewelry and subtle makeup her only
ornamentation.

&quot;Hanging around the loving couples can get tiresome,&quot;
Hotaru said honestly, looking back at the crowd
clustered around one figure.

Minako chuckled softly, nodding in agreement.

Lady Mercury, Ami Mizuno, was pregnant, an
announcement that had shaken up the entire court. Her
wife Rei Hino stood proudly by her side, even as Queen
Serenity and her husband Endymion talked to them
happily. It was a momentous occasion and a joyful one,
and it seemed strangely fitting to announce it here at
the celebration of the completion of the palace.

&quot;Not that I can blame them,&quot; she answered. Minako
chuckled, &quot;Can you believe that they&#39;ve already picked
out a name?&quot;

&quot;Ran Mizuno,&quot; Hotaru nodded. She looked out again,
&quot;Though I&#39;d have mixed feelings about raising a child
in a place like this.&quot;

&quot;Rebuilding this Junkyard City into someplace like
Crystal Tokyo isn&#39;t going to be very easy,&quot; Minako
quietly acknowledged, &quot;though I think for Serenity
it&#39;s a case of putting her money where her mouth is.&quot;

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Hotaru conceded.

&quot;You know, Ami did some calculations,&quot; a faint smile
appeared on Minako&#39;s face, &quot;taking into account the
urban sprawl and land shifts, we&#39;re standing on old
Tokyo.&quot;

Hotaru blinked, then she chuckled softly. &quot;It does
make sense,&quot; she admitted. She gave Minako a look, &quot;I
do wish that Luna and Artemis had been able to get
away from their duties at the lunar colony for this.&quot;

&quot;Me, too,&quot; Minako agreed, thinking fondly of the
little white cat that had worked so long to keep her
out of trouble.

&quot;Did you notice the looks that Haruka and Michiru were
exchanging?&quot; Hotaru brought the subject back around to
the party that they were studiously avoiding.

&quot;I understand that they asked Ami for an appointment,&quot;
Minako looked thoughtful, &quot;you think there&#39;s another
little bundle of joy coming?&quot;

&quot;Wouldn&#39;t surprise me,&quot; Hotaru said, &quot;they&#39;ve been
talking about it.&quot; She smiled suddenly, &quot;I would have
thought raising me got most of the parenting impulse
out of them, but I guess not.&quot;

&quot;Wonder who gets to carry the baby?&quot; Minako mused.

Both women contemplated the mental image of the boyish
Haruka pregnant and instantly chimed out together,
&quot;Michiru!&quot;

Minako turned back to the party for a moment, watching
familiar friends and comrades mingle and suddenly felt
sick of all of it. &quot;I think we&#39;ve both paid our
respects,&quot; she looked over at Hotaru, &quot;do you want to
leave?&quot;

Hotaru flashed a rare smile, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;

With polite pleasantries to various friends they
slipped from the great hall together, walking down the
halls towards the lifts. Stepping into the tube a
faint light washed over them as a verbal command sent
they slowly descending through the levels of the
palace.

&quot;Are you busy today?&quot; Minako asked softly, unaware of
how the currents of air were ruffling her loose
skirts.

A faint blush colored Hotaru&#39;s cheeks as she caught a
flash of pure white panties and looked away. &quot;No, not
at all,&quot; she admitted, &quot;you?&quot;

Minako chuckled softly, &quot;I really should be working on
my new job, but I think I can play hooky for a day.&quot;

&quot;Being head of the diplomatic corps is going to be
interesting,&quot; Hotaru said as they slowed to a stop,
&quot;not to mention your other duties.&quot;

Minako stepped off the lift first, giving Hotaru a wry
look as she said, &quot;Does everyone know I&#39;m going to be
head spy?&quot;

&quot;Just the members of the inner circle,&quot; Hotaru said as
she stepped out after her into the residential wing of
the palace. They walked together down the hall,
&quot;Serenity is pretty good at keeping secrets, really.&quot;

&quot;She certainly kept our secret until we were ready to
tell the others about our relationship,&quot; Minako agreed
when they reached their door, keying it open as the
two women walked inside. &quot;I thought that Haruka was
going to kill me when they all found out,&quot; Minako
remembered that day, &quot;not to mention Setsuna.&quot;

&quot;My three mothers can be a bit overprotective at
times,&quot; Hotaru admitted as they went into the living
room, settling down onto the large couch together,
&quot;thankfully Juri calmed Setsuna down pretty fast and
Michiru always handles Haruka well.&quot;

&quot;I almost think Haruka was scarier,&quot; Minako quietly
mused, &quot;she all but threatened my life for corrupting
her little girl.&quot;

Hotaru snuggled close to Minako&#39;s side, laying her
head on the other woman&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Wonder what
Haruka would have done if she knew that I was the one
who had to seduce you?&quot; she asked her impishly.

&quot;She&#39;d never believe it,&quot; Minako murmured as they
kissed gently.

Their coming together had happened during the wars,
the many battles that had gone on as the Sailor Senshi
and their allies had fought to restore peace to the
world. Both of them alone, often fighting side by side
against dangerous foes, they had grown closer over the
course of many months. Finally, on a cold night out on
some forgotten battlefield Hotaru had crawled into
Minako&#39;s bed roll and did what came naturally.

&quot;Does it bother you,&quot; Hotaru asked her softly from
where she was held in Minako&#39;s arms, &quot;knowing this
isn&#39;t going to last?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the soldier of love,&quot; Minako shrugged slightly as
she answered, &quot;I understand that there are different
kinds of love. The gentle love of a summer, versus the
eternal love of two soulmates.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;re more than just a summer love,&quot; Hotaru protested
gently.

Minako stroked black hair, &quot;Maybe so, but we could
also carry on if one of us lost the other. If Michiru
died, I think Haruka would follow her right after
dealing with who dared to take Michiru away from her.
It would be the same for the Queen and Endymion or Rei
and Ami.&quot;

&quot;True,&quot; Hotaru admitted reluctantly.

Minako&#39;s arms tightened around Hotaru slightly as she
chuckled, &quot;Gods that was gloomy! I&#39;m sorry, love.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m the one who asked,&quot; Hotaru said gently. She
smiled slightly, &quot;You know, I have plans for
tonight...&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Minako asked.

Hotaru continued on, &quot;A lovely dinner for two, some
wine, desert and then maybe we could both go to bed
early.&quot;

&quot;Well. we do need to be well rested tomorrow,&quot; Minako
said perkily, batting her blue eyes innocently.

Hotaru kissed her lingeringly, a kiss that clearly
spoke of desire. &quot;Trust me,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;we
won&#39;t be resting much.&quot;

&quot;Are you going to have your wicked way with me?&quot;
Minako looked worried, &quot;Unleashing unspeakable desires
upon my innocent form?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Hotaru nodded firmly.

&quot;Oh, good,&quot; Minako kissed her once again. &#39;This may
not last forever,&#39; she thought to herself, &#39;but it&#39;s
enough for me.&#39;

End

Authors Notes: This was originally going to be a
chapter in the Eternal City, Crystal Tokyo series, but
I couldn&#39;t figure out where to fit it in. It&#39;s set
well before the birth of Erica Tenoh, and it would be
difficult to fit in as a flashback. The time period is
in the mid 29th century, about, when the Palace has
been founded and the city that will be known as
Crystal Tokyo is beginning to come together.</pre>
