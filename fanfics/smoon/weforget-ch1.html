<h1>What Did We Forget? (part 1 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/venusreiko.html">Venus Reiko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Minako fell back onto a pillow she&#39;d stolen from Rei&#39;s bed and placed on 
the floor before letting out a lengthy sigh. Her long, wavy blonde hair 
cascaded over the pillow and onto the deep maroon carpet, and she 
stretched her arms out at the sides of her body. Her large, azure blue 
eyes scanned over the ceiling before her head fell to the side, giving 
her a view of Rei&#39;s long shapely legs which to Minako&#39;s dismay, were 
covered by her black knee socks. She &quot;discretely&quot; moved herself and the 
pillow closer to the raven-haired teen to continue her eyes&#39; journey up 
Rei&#39;s legs and under her dark, gray school skirt. Minako raised a 
playful eyebrow at how short the skirt was. Yes, just a little further 
and she&#39;d have the PERFECT view&#151;

&quot;Ow!&quot; she cried out when Rei flicked her in the nose with her toe. 
Minako summoned up a few fake tears (successfully perfected thanks to 
acting classes) and feigned utter hurt as she looked up at Rei, pouting 
out her bottom lip for emphasis. The priestess didn&#39;t fall for Minako&#39;s 
little act but instead smirked down at her. She crossed her arms over 
her crossed legs, the book she&#39;d been reading moments ago dangling from 
her right hand.

&quot;You&#39;re such a little pervert, you know that?&quot;

Minako looked up at her with wide, innocent eyes.

&quot;Aino Minako a pervert? Why, I&#39;ve never heard anything so absurd in my 
life! I&#39;m just a young, innocent girl with a pure heart and crazy 
hormones!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;I can&#39;t control how my body reacts when I see an 
unbelievably beautiful woman such as yourself only a few feet away, 
Rei-chan! Besides...after last night, I&#39;m convinced you&#39;re the hentai.&quot;

Rei rose her eyebrows. &quot;Me? But wasn&#39;t it you, Aino-chan, who was trying 
desperately to get a peek up my skirt only moments ago?&quot;

Minako gasped. She pointed a long, slender finger at the priestess.

&quot;How could you accuse me of doing something so crude and disrespectful?! 
And here I was, thinking we were such close friends...&quot;

&quot;Girlfriends.&quot; Rei corrected.

&quot;Exactly! So why&#39;d you attempt to break my adorable, little nose?&quot; 
Minako pouted. Rei stood up and grabbed Minako&#39;s hands, pulling her up 
as well. She put the blonde&#39;s hands on her shoulders and wrapped her own 
around Minako&#39;s waist. She smirked as she leant in close to her 
girlfriend&#39;s ear.

&quot;You forgot to ask.&quot;

Minako felt a shiver run down her spine when Rei&#39;s breath lightly 
tickled her ear. When the dark-haired teen pulled back, Minako peered 
into her amethyst eyes, her own blue ones sparkling with love and 
mischief. She leant forward and her pink lips met with Rei&#39;s. They held 
the kiss as they fell back onto the bed, careful not to bump teeth-or 
heads- when the bed sprang their bodies back up. Minako gently parted 
Rei&#39;s lips with her tongue, receiving immediate entrance. Their tongues 
crashed together in a fierce kiss as Rei ran her fingers through 
Minako&#39;s silky tresses. She let out a soft contented sigh when Minako&#39;s 
hands left her shoulders and slowly began to run over her body. Rei 
broke the kiss and pressed her lips to Minako&#39;s earlobe, nibbling 
lightly before trailing kisses from her neck to her collarbone.

Minako, meanwhile, abruptly stopped with her ministrations and pulled 
her right hand out from under Rei&#39;s blazer. She climbed off of Rei, 
taking a seat next to her with a foot tucked under herself. The senshi 
of fire sat up as well, her expression portraying confusion and 
annoyance.

&quot;What is it?&quot;

The blonde put an index finger and her thumb to her chin.

&quot;Something&#151;doesn&#39;t feel right.&quot; Rei titled her head slightly, a nicely 
shaped eyebrow rising.

&quot;Was it me...?&quot;

Minako&#39;s eyes widened and then she let out a laugh. She waved her hand 
back and forth as Rei glared.

&quot;No! Not at all!&quot; Minako leant in towards the priestess with an impish 
smile. &quot;Everything you do to me feels right, Rei-chan.&quot; She pecked her 
on the lips and pulled back. Rei rolled her eyes as she fought back a 
doofy grin that only Minako was capable of pulling out of her.

&quot;It&#39;s just... Did we have any plans for today?&quot; Minako asked. Rei shook 
her head.

&quot;No plans besides the two of us hanging out. Ami&#39;s out with her mother 
looking at a new medical university,&quot; she began counting on her fingers, 
&quot;Mako-chan&#39;s stalking a current sempai-look-alike, odango-atama&#39;s with 
her precious Mamo-chan, and the outers are M.I.A. as usual.&quot;

&quot;Any holidays we&#39;re forgetting? Festivals? Anniversaries? Weddings? 
Funerals?&quot; the senshi of love inquired. Rei rolled her eyes again and 
lightly grasped Minako&#39;s wrists, sliding her hands down so she could 
intertwine their fingers together.

&quot;Minako. The only thing you and I are going to do is spend time 
together. For once everyone else is busy and to top it off, grandpa and 
Yuuichiro are in Osaka visiting potential sponsors. We have the shrine 
all to ourselves...&quot; She slowly pushed Minako onto her back, holding the 
blonde&#39;s arms to her sides. The playful twinkle returned to Minako&#39;s 
eyes, and she smirked up at her raven-haired lover.

&quot;...And we can make all the noise we&#39;d like.&quot; Rei finished.

Minako spread her legs so that Rei could slip between them, and when she 
did, she enclosed her legs around her lover&#39;s waist.

She folded her hands behind Rei&#39;s neck and pulled her closer until their 
lips met in a slow, sensual kiss. The priestess&#39; long, dark hair fell 
from over her shoulder and onto the bed, mixing with her girlfriend&#39;s 
golden locks. Rei let go of Minako&#39;s wrists and one hand traveled 
southward while the other headed up to cup Minako&#39;s cheek to deepen the 
kiss. The blonde let out a soft moan when she felt Rei&#39;s hand run up the 
side of her leg and then stop to rub her thigh.

Right as their kiss started to heat up, Rei grunted and reluctantly 
pulled her head back. She looked down at Minako&#39;s school skirt, which 
was currently stuck on her cuffed sleeves.

&quot;What&#39;s wrong, Rei-chan?&quot; Minako asked, slightly panting.

&quot;My jacket sleeve somehow got twisted with the band in your skirt.&quot; The 
dark-haired teen lowered her eyebrows as she tugged on the tangled 
contraption.

&quot;Stupid skirt...too long...Damn it,&quot; she mumbled, Minako giving her an 
amused smile.

&quot;Sweetie, just take your jacket off. It&#39;d be much easier if you did 
that. Or... I could simply get rid of the skirt altogether.&quot; She flashed 
a seductive smile and pulled Rei&#39;s face close to hers, barely grazing 
their lips against each other&#39;s. Rei pushed their lips together, her 
hormones returning with a vengeance. Minako&#39;s legs tightened around her 
waist.

&quot;Mm... Wait,&quot; Rei said, breaking the kiss once again. Minako sighed out 
of frustration and dropped her hands from around the priestess&#39; neck 
onto the bed.

&quot;Let me get this really quick.&quot;

Rei reached for the buttons on her school blazer, her fingers fumbling 
to get them open. After a few attempts and only one button successfully 
undone, she growled and gave up. Minako, who&#39;d been watching the whole 
ordeal, raised her eyebrows.

&quot;Want me to help?&quot; Rei rolled her eyes, shrugging her shoulders out of 
indifference. Finally, she nodded. Minako&#39;s long digits reached up and 
plucked the buttons open with ease, slowly revealing Rei&#39;s crisp, white 
polo underneath. As she began to slide the blazer from Rei&#39;s left 
shoulder, Rei experimentally pulled a few more last times on her sleeve.

&quot;Rei, are you in there?&quot; asked a low, smooth voice. Before Rei or Minako 
could even react, Haruka, Usagi, Ami, and Makoto burst into the room.

Lo and behold Rei was in fact home, and Minako seemed to be...&#39;visiting&#39; 
as well. The position to be caught in could&#39;ve been worse of course, but 
their current one was pretty up there. Minako stripping Rei, with her 
legs tightly wrapped around the girl&#39;s waist as if she were holding on 
for dear life; and then Rei&#39;s hand under the senshi of love&#39;s skirt, her 
arm moving in a rather...interesting manner.

Rei paused, eyes widening as she slowly turned her head toward the owner 
of the voice she&#39;d just heard.

&#39;Oh, God... No. You CAN&#39;T be serious. That is NOT who I think it is,&#39; 
she thought to herself.

Oh, but it was.

&quot;H-Haruka!&quot; she exclaimed before falling off of Minako and crashing to 
the ground. However, seeing as her jacket was still stuck on the 
blonde&#39;s skirt, Minako rolled off the bed as well and fell right on top 
of Rei. Their heads crashed together, surely creating a bruise for 
later. Haruka, Ami, and Makoto winced, while Usagi crossed her arms and 
turned her head up with an indignant pout.

&quot;Wow. You were right, Mako-chan. They&#39;re pretty bad,&quot; Haruka said with a 
smirk. &quot;At least Michiru and I make sure we&#39;re not caught having our 
&#39;alone time&#39;.&quot;

Ami blushed and turned away. Makoto struggled to stifle her laughter as 
Rei and Minako tried to situate themselves.

&quot;I told you.&quot;

Minako rolled off of Rei, whose blazer was half-on and half-off, her arm 
still attached to Minako&#39;s skirt. That having slipped her mind, Rei rose 
the arm to feel the bump forming on her forehead, taking Minako&#39;s skirt 
up with it. Haruka and Makoto&#39;s eyes shot open as they got a full view 
of the senshi of love&#39;s Sailor V. panties.

&quot;REI!&quot; Minako shouted as she attempted to push her skirt down. Usagi did 
her best to stay angry with the two, but couldn&#39;t as she broke out into 
a fit of laughter. Makoto and Haruka joined in, but Ami adamantly 
refused to look at her tangled friends.

Minako pulled Rei&#39;s hand back down before she viciously pulled the 
jacket from her girlfriend&#39;s form. She mumbled incoherent words to 
herself as she turned around and went to work on her skirt.

&quot;It&#39;s not what it looks like,&quot; Rei started, but then paused. &quot;Well, it 
is, but... It&#39;s complicated.&quot;

&quot;It didn&#39;t look all that complicated a few minutes ago,&quot; Haruka teased. 
Rei tried to muster up a glare, but the best she could come up with was 
a half-frown and very rosy cheeks.

&quot;I told you they forgot, Ami-chan!&quot; Usagi exclaimed, the resentful look 
back on her face. Ami scratched the back of her head and looked at the 
ground.

&quot;Forgot what, odango?&quot; Rei asked, her eyes narrowed in annoyance. 
Without warning, Usagi&#39;s bottom lip began trembling and she broke out 
into tears.

&quot;WAAAAAAH! You&#39;re so mean, Rei-chan! I can&#39;t believe you!&quot;

Ami tried to console her while Haruka shook her head. Rei rose her 
eyebrows.

&quot;What did we forget?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s June thirtieth,&quot; Makoto replied. The priestess shrugged.

&quot;So?&quot;

She heard Minako gasp, so she turned her head to face the blonde.

&quot;It&#39;s Usagi-chan&#39;s birthday!&quot;</pre>
