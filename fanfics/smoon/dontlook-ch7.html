<h1>Don't Look Back (part 7 of 12)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/angelos.html">Angelos</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dontlook-ch6.html">Back to Part 6</a><pre>The next week passed in a blur for Michiru as she slowly learned the 
ropes of the business, Setsuna being the most helpful. The older woman 
had taken her under her wing, showing her how to handle the catwalk, 
how to put on makeup, and how to deal with the ever cold Rei Hino. And 
Michiru still hadn&#146;t seen Haruka since the meeting. She&#146;d come home, 
Michiru knew, since the lights she&#146;d kept on were always turned off 
and Coffee made when she woke up. Already it was Thursday and they&#146;d 
be leaving the next morning.

&#147;Haruka&#133;where are you?&#148; Michiru wondered to herself as she stood by 
the wall of windows overlooking the city. She jumped slightly as the 
phone beside her started ringing shrilly.

&#147;Moshi moshi, Ten&#146;oh residence.&#148; Michiru chirped as she picked up the 
phone.

&#147;Come to dinner with me?&#148; a well-known husky voice asked quietly as 
Michiru pictured Haruka on the other end, grinning charmingly.

&#147;Where? What time?&#148; Michiru asked, earning soft laughter from the 
other woman.

&#147;I&#146;m waiting outside the building. It&#146;s a surprise. Grab a sweater&#148;

*Click*

Michiru stood staring blankly at the phone from a moment before a slow 
smile graced her features. Dashing back to her room, she slipped on a 
new pair of jeans, covering her blue tank top with a black &#145;Nike&#146; 
sweater. (AN: I don&#39;t own Nike either)

Pulling her purse with her, she fairly ran to the elevator, sliding 
the card into the slot before bracing herself against the wall, still 
not used to the sickening speed the elevator fell with, the numbers 
above the door giving a small light show as Michiru held her stomach. 
She looked up as the elevator stopped 5 floors before it was supposed 
to, the hairs on the back of her neck rising as the doors opened.

&#147;Hello Miss Kaioh.&#148; A silky smooth voice murmured as Derek Windwood 
walked into the elevator, &#147;where are you going so late? You should be 
resting for tomorrow.&#148;

&#147;I-I&#146;m going to dinner with Haruka.&#148; Michiru stuttered, edging away 
from the man who made her feel slightly sicker then the elevator ride 
itself. She nearly jumped from the wall in her haste to get out of the 
small lift, dashing out into the lobby where Haruka was waiting for 
her.

&#147;Michiru, what&#146;s wrong?&#148; The blonde asked, looking up to meet the eyes 
of Derek, before being pulled away by a near frantic Michiru.

&#147;Lets j-just go, p-please?&#148; Derek heard her stutter before they went 
out of earshot. A dark smile curled his lips as a plan to get rid of 
the girl formed in his mind&#133;
