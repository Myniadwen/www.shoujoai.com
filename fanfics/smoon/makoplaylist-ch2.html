<h1>Makoto's Playlist (part 2 of 8)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chakeroo.html">chakeroo</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/makoplaylist-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><p class="p1">The four senshis were studying at the miko’s room and everyone was getting 
bored except Usagi who was sleeping.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“I miss my Makochan…” Minako said out loud and sighed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Everybody was amazed with what she said and Ami and Rei could be seen smiling 
while Usagi still slept, a couple of Rei’s mangas scattered beside her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako then turned the page of the book she was reading and scribbled 
something unto her notebook. She let out a sigh again.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She’s just sorting out some papers for the café she’s opening Minakochan. 
Besides, she’s still here in Japan and it’s only been 3 days.” Ami answered without looking 
at her. She gripped the book trying really hard not to tease the blonde. She looked at Rei 
and the miko was grinning.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“She always studies with us here even though she graduated a year ago. But 
it’s 3 days now, Ami! She won’t be back until tomorrow afternoon. That’s almost 4 days! I 
don’t like it when I don’t see her.” Minako looked at Ami with puppy dog eyes then 
pouted.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why do you miss her that much? It’s not like your together or something. OR 
are you?” Rei said, smiling evilly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Minako blushed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why are you blushing Minachan?” asked Usagi, sleepily scratching her 
eyes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“That’s because she finally confessed that she likes Makochan.” Answered Rei 
as she looked at Minako while moving her eyebrows up and down.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Oooooohhh… really?!?!? Did you confess Minachan?!? Did you finally 
confess?!?” Usagi asked wide eyed then sprinting towards Minako and starts to shake 
her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Your cute together you know.” Ami said putting her book down and resting her 
chin at the back of her hand and looks at Minako sheepishly. Usagi was still shaking Minako 
and Rei sweat dropped.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It's not like that! I mean…” Minako trailed off. <i>Shit… I can’t think of 
anything why I said that. But it’s true. I just really miss her when I’m not with her. And 
why the fuck am I blushing?!? </i>She asked herself.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Somewhere in Japan, Makoto began to sneeze repeatedly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>I feel like somebody is talking about me.</i> She felt goose bumps all 
over her body and then she sneezed again. <i>It must be the weather. </i>She thought and 
went on her way to see a family friend.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>NEXT DAY</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was walking up the stairs of the shrine clutching a plastic bag full 
of food. She was mouthing the last words of the song that played on her iPod. The song was 
done and as she stopped at the top of the stairs, she saw Minako talking with Usagi at the 
shrine and the next song began to play…</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p3">Every single time I see you I start to feel this way <br>
Makes me wonder if I'm ever gonna feel this way again <br>
There's a picture that's hanging in the back of my head <br>
I see it over and over <br>
I want to hold you and love you in my arms and then <br>
I want to need you cause I need to be with you till the end <br>
Then I hear myself reply you've got to hold it in <br>
This time, tonight <br>
<br>
If only I had the guts to feel this way <br>
If only you'd look at me and want to stay <br>
If only I'd take you in my arms and say <br>
I won't go cause I need you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p4"><br></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s1">Minako brushed her hair away from her forehead. The sunlight 
was highlighting the blonde’s hair and curves and Makoto looked at her dazed, still 
mouthing the lyrics.</span><br>
<br>
I sit here, waiting, wondering, hoping, that I'll make this right <br>
Cause all I think about is your hands <br>
Your face, and all these lonely nights <br>
There's a feeling that's screaming in the back of my head<br>
Saying over and over <br>
I want to hold you and love you in my arms and then <br>
I want to need you cause I need to be with you till the end <br>
Then I hear myself reply she'll never let you in <br>
This time, tonight <br>
<br>
If only I have the guts to feel this way <br>
If only you'd look at me and want to stay <br>
If only I'd take you in my arms and say <br>
I won't go cause I need you <br>
<br>
Please don't go cause I need you now <br>
<br>
I want to hear you say <br>
It'll always be this way <br>
We will be hand in hand for every night and every day <br>
I want to scream and shout <br>
Cause I'm losing any doubt <br>
And all I care about is you and me and us and now<span 
class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p5"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto was still mouthing the words until the end of the song. Little did she 
know, Ami was right at the back, hearing the song and waited until it finished. She then 
pinched Makoto’s side and the brunette jumped, almost falling from the stairs. Ami 
laughed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Ami! You freaking startled me. You’re like a ninja!” shouted Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Nice song. So you’re that whipped, huh?” Ami asked Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Sort of.” Makoto answered blushing.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Why don’t you tell her? She is the <i>Goddess of Love</i> after all. I know 
she would understand.” Told blue haired girl.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“It’s not that easy Ami. I wished it was but it’s not.” Makoto sighed 
sadly.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Ami looked at her friend with concern as they begin to walk towards the two 
blondes.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Seeing the two girls approach the shrine, Usagi runs and jumps towards Makoto 
and hugs her. Rei comes out of the door of the shrine to see what the commotion was about. 
Seeing Usagi running to Makoto, she looks at Minako and sees her blush a little. Minako 
doesn’t notice that the miko was smirking.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Did you buy me food Makochan?” Usagi eagerly asks the brunette still hugging 
her.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Of course my Queen.” Makoto smiled, puts Usagi down and hands her the 
bag.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Yey! You’re like my knight and shining ar… Ooooh! This one looks delicious!” 
Usagi shouted happily and Ami then looks inside the bag that Usagi was holding.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Hey Makochan!” shouted Rei, surprising Minako.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto looks at Rei and sees Minako blushing. She then blushed also.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Oh Kami… I really missed her. Maybe I should hug her or something. No. 
Yes. No. Yes. Oh stop it. Just do it you baka! </i>Makoto argued with herself as she walked 
towards the blonde.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Here it goes. </i>Makoto walked towards Minako and she suddenly hugged the 
blonde and whispered, “I missed you Minachan.” <i>She smells nice. I could definitely get 
used to this. Ha-ha… wait… pull away Makoto before she notices.</i></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">The blonde was surprised and before she could hug back, the brunette pulled 
away.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>She hugged me. Oh no, I didn’t hug back. Well she pulled away first but… 
She smells so nice and warm and… what am I thinking? She looks so cute… Aaargh! All of 
their teasing is really getting into me. I shouldn’t let her notice.</i> Minako thought as 
her face turned beet red.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">”Hey Reichan, bought you something. It’s in the plastic bag Usagichan’s 
holding.” Makoto said looking all happy and giddy and panicky at the same time as she 
passes Rei.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1"><i>Okay… breathe Makoto… You hugged her… Get yourself together or your knees 
might buckle… Come on… She smells soooooooooooooo nice… Thanks Kami for giving me the guts 
to hug her that time.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></i> Thought Makoto.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">“Good job Makochan.” Whispered Rei as she passed.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Makoto blushed and hurriedly went inside.</p>
