<h1>I'll Protect You (part 14 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>&quot;To begin our meeting, we should introduce ourselves in our traditional 
way...We are the men...called Sanctuary. We are the famously hired 
assassins back then, and became silent seven years ago&quot;

&quot;Seven years ago because we stayed silent after the last incident in the 
Hydra stadium&quot;

&quot;So what made you stop after what you&#39;ve done to the Hydra stadium?&quot; Rei 
asked

The speaker laughed

&quot;...We really wished that it was us who did that. But we didn&#39;t, the 
TNPH were too lazy to investigate. But because we are always known for 
blowing up stadiums, they pointed us out to be the ones guilty for the 
crime&quot;

&quot;So I guess you had the idea who really did that right?&quot; Rei asked again

&quot;...Unfortunately no. And we don&#39;t really care who did it. But it was 
because of that incident we became silent until this year&quot;

&quot;Then what does that have to do with Minako&#39;s concert?&quot; Rei yelled

&quot;Aren&#39;t you going to ask what we needed from you?&quot; The voice asked

&quot;Of course I would get to that point, I just thought that you men were 
only going to boast out your oh-so-noble doings and tell me that you&#39;re 
killing Minako&quot; Rei said

&quot;Actually it really has nothing to do with what we are planning in 
Minako&#39;s concert&quot;

&quot;Damn it, stop talking nonsense!&quot;

&quot;Hush Hino-chan. If you really want to get to our point then please calm 
down. We know how much you value Ms. Aino. We are here to ask you a 
favor&quot;

&quot;What is it?&quot; Asked Rei suspiciously

&quot;...Join Sanctuary&quot;

--

-Minako&#39;s Hotel Room-

Minako sat silently at the couch while ignoring other&#39;s suggestions. She 
looks deeply out of thought as she gazes at the window

&#39;Rei-chan&#39;s hiding something from me. It&#39;s obvious when I tried to sneak 
behind her back. Rei...why can&#39;t I read your mind? Why until now that 
you can&#39;t tell me what you want to say? She should know by now that we 
could figure things out easier if we help each other&#39;

&quot;Minako? Are you alright?&quot; one of the make-up artists asked. All eyes 
were now looking at her. She looked at them with pure coldness and 
annoyance

&quot;I&#39;m fine, just don&#39;t bother me&quot; Then she turns her head back at the 
window

The head chief sighed as she looks at the pop star with pity. Both 
Minako and Rei are innocent victims on what is seriously going on. They 
didn&#39;t have much of a choice because if they tell the truth, the pop 
star may panic or be stressed or worst faint instantly. But the head 
chief doubted the pop star would do that, for him, Minako has a strong 
personality in his opinion

&quot;But Minako, we can&#39;t confirm our decision without your confirmation and 
opinion&quot; The fashion designer said

&quot;Do whatever you want to do. Just stop bothering me&quot; Said Minako without 
even glancing at them

The fashion designer looked at Wendy questioningly

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with her?&quot; The fashion designer hissed at Wendy

&quot;Love sick&quot; Wendy simply replied as she checks her pocket scheduler, not 
showing any concern

The make-up artists and the fashion designer looked at each other. Even 
more confused than ever

The head chief approached the pop star

&quot;If you don&#39;t mind Aino-san, can I talk to you for a while personally? 
But if you really don&#39;t feel like talking it&#39;s alright with me&quot; The head 
chief asked

It took five seconds for Minako to confirm and nodded numbly. She stood 
up and as the head chief patiently waited for her to lead the way in a 
place where there is privacy and no one can hear about the upcoming 
conversation

As they got outside Minako&#39;s staff flooded Wendy with questions. But 
Wendy ignored them and yelled that they should be doing their job

--

-Inside the Hotel Bedroom-

&quot;I see that your staff will sleep in a different room number am I right 
Aino-san?&quot; The head chief started

&quot;They couldn&#39;t fit here so I suggested that they get another room&quot; Aino 
replied, her face still expressionless

The head chief studied the pop star for a while then...

&quot;Is it because of her?&quot; The head chief asked

&quot;H-huh?&quot; Minako didn&#39;t know what to answer

&quot;Is it because of Rei, that you became suddenly upset?&quot;

&quot;I...well...&quot; Minako could make out the words from her mouth, so she 
just looked away instead

&quot;I guess she said something rude to you, I hope not. Rei sometimes talks 
and do whatever she wants without caring about anybody&#39;s feelings. You 
became really close to her, and so do I and Rinka. Tell me, did you two 
argued? I&#39;ll punish Rei for upsetting you, she wouldn&#39;t have--&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t control her tears and emotions anymore; she sobbed and 
hugged the head chief tightly

&quot;A-Aino-san...&quot;

&quot;Oh big boss, I&#39;m so sorry! I love her! I love her so much that I 
couldn&#39;t last a second without her ever since I met her...I really 
do...I-I...I&#39;m sorry we hid this from you...&quot;

The head chief was shocked at the pop star&#39;s confession. So the rumor 
was true after all. But all that he can do right now is not to judge the 
pop star and his niece on what they had become. He has no right to do 
that; he should be helping in the situation instead

&quot;Aino-san...please calm down...I&#39;m really sorry. I didn&#39;t expect that 
assigning Rei to be your personal bodyguard will lead into this&quot; The 
head chief apologized

Minako looked at him

&quot;Big boss, don&#39;t say such things. It was because of that, I finally met 
the person that will truly make me the happiest person alive&quot; Minako 
said looking straight to the head chief&#39;s eyes

&quot;It&#39;s just...&quot;

&quot;What is it, Aino-san?&quot; The head chief asked

&quot;Rei...there is something she won&#39;t open up to me. I knew something&#39;s 
wrong and she thinks I believe all that she tells me, especially before 
she left tonight. I observed her. I always do. I may be a pop star, but 
it doesn&#39;t mean that all I can do is to sing, perform and sign 
autographs for my fans. Rei is keeping her problems to herself, and 
that&#39;s what I&#39;m mad at!&quot; Minako said

The head chief sighed

&quot;...To tell you the truth Aino-san, that is also the thing that I 
dislike from Rei. She&#39;s too silent when it comes to problems. A lot of 
people in the headquarters are having difficulty in understanding her. 
They couldn&#39;t read her mind, yet sometimes her emotions are so obvious&quot; 
He explained

&quot;But you know Aino-san, if you try hard to make Rei confess what&#39;s going 
on with her, she&#39;ll definitely tell you the truth. She&#39;s just having a 
great difficulty in trusting everyone around her; and that includes me I 
guess&quot; He said as he continued but his mind flew on thoughts after that

&#39;What the heck am I saying? I encouraged Aino-san to make Rei confess 
about the problems that are happening in the TNPH? Oh well, I&#39;ll face 
that later, I have do something about this and I had no choice&#39;

&quot;Big boss are you okay?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Oh, of course Aino-san I&#39;m okay. So, you and your staff are already 
organizing your outfits for the concert?&quot; The head chief changed the 
subject

&quot;Yes, and did you know that there is also a bonus mini movie before the 
concert starts? I hope you&#39;ll see that big boss! They will be screening 
my past concerts from Europe in a large flat screen that hung in the 
center of the main stage!&quot; Minako said cheerfully

&quot;I&#39;ll look forward to that&quot; The head chief said, he was relieved that 
the pop star smiled again

&quot;I&#39;m really excited in this coming concert, so I must keep my self extra 
busy starting tomorrow...I&#39;ll...keep my self busy-&quot;

A tear escaped from Minako&#39;s eyes. The head chief quickly noticed this

&quot;Aino-san...&quot; The head chief wiped Minako&#39;s tears with his hanky

&quot;...Thank you for listening and understanding me big boss&quot; The pop star 
said as she leans her head to the head chief&#39;s shoulder, the head chief 
patted her soft blonde hair

--

-Back at the abandoned place-

&quot;Join you? I&#39;m not crazy enough to do that! What makes you think I that 
I&#39;ll easily agree and join you?&quot; Rei yelled at the man in front of her

Four of the men including the one in front of Rei laughed, which 
irritated the police woman

&quot;Tsk, tsk, tsk...Hino-chan-&quot;

&quot;I said stop calling me that! And what the hell are you laughing about?&quot; 
Rei asked

&quot;We&#39;re laughing because it&#39;s something that we know and you don&#39;t. So if 
you join us you&#39;ll probably understand why we were laughing&quot; The fourth 
voice spoke

Rei couldn&#39;t stand them anymore. She took out her hand gun and pointed 
it straight to the heart of the man in front of her

&quot;Bullshit the conditions! You guys are totally insane!&quot; Yelled Rei

One of the men behind stood alert to take his gun when the man in front 
of Rei raised his hand to signal his companion to stop drawing his gun

&quot;Hino-chan...What makes you think we are insane?&quot; Asked the first voice, 
Rei can tell the man is smirking by the tone of his voice

&quot;Well that&#39;s easy. First you have your companion there who looks like he 
was deeply in love with his feather. Next the other one who talks 
nonsense and tries to make waste of my time, and whoever wrote that 
stupid poem, is stupid and insane enough for me, and then there&#39;s you, 
who keeps calling me Hino-chan, for some odd reason that you really 
sound gay and it irritates me...I guess those reasons are enough&quot; Rei 
answered breathlessly

There was short silence before the first voice spoke

&quot;...I see that you observe the most little things we do. You are 
correct. We all have our own deficiencies. But have you seen your own? 
You are just like us Hino-chan, and everybody is just like us. We all 
have our deficiencies. It&#39;s just that ours are easily noticed while some 
hide it&quot;

&quot;But even though we have this kind of deficiency, we do have something 
that other people don&#39;t. We call it &#39;Special Gifts&#39;&quot; He continued while 
taking out something from his pocket. Rei alerted herself

He took out a silver necklace with a round pendant crafted with a Lion 
with white wings with a long sword pierced through its wings. He held 
the necklace by its chain and showed it in front of Rei

&quot;W-what is that?&quot; Asked Rei

&quot;Look at what I can do Hino-chan...Hmm...What should I do first? I see 
that my life is threatened because your gun is pointing at me. Perhaps I 
should make it point to you?&quot; he said as he waves the necklace, making a 
pendulum

At that instant Rei felt her hands turn numb and moving involuntarily 
against her will. Now her own hands are pointing the gun on her heart

&quot;What the-you can-&quot;

&quot;Control my victims. I can also hypnotize them, I call it Curse. How 
does it feel now that you are threatened by yourself? I am one of those 
few lucky ones who learned this skill. I am also not just an ordinary 
hypnotist. My curse can last as long as I wanted it to remain&quot; He 
explained

&#39;Damn it, not now&#39; Rei thought

&quot;As for you, I just want you to see what I can do&quot;

&quot;So do I have to avoid looking at your pendant?&quot; Rei said sarcastically

&quot;Look at it or not, the curse will still take effect. As long as the 
person is few meters near me and I can make a perfect pendulum. I can 
command anyone by whisper. Now I&#39;ll have to make you throw your gun&quot; He 
said while dowsing his necklace

Rei&#39;s hand involuntarily threw her gun few meters away

&quot;Now I release you from the curse Hino-chan&quot;

Rei can now move herself and her hands. The agent was shaking and 
speechless but she tried to make out the words from her mouth

&quot;W-w-why are you telling and showing these things to me?&quot;

&quot;...Because we want you to realize something. The poem we sent to the 
TNPH. Have you recalled the last sentence?&quot; The second voice asked

Rei tried hard to recall the last sentence although she&#39;s still quite 
shaky

&#39;The last one... &quot;We do hope you understand this, because it&#39;s-&quot;&#39;

&quot;...Useless anyway...&#39;Useless&#39; is the title of the fifth song in 
Minako&#39;s special edition album&quot; She said absent mindedly

&quot;Right. You figured it out as sooner as we expected. Perhaps do you know 
how the Sanctuary can be stopped from doing it?&quot; Replied the man who 
recently spoke

&quot;...Minako&#39;s life...is at sake here right?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;Uh-huh&quot; The first voice replied as she places back his necklace this 
time around his neck

&quot;...and because you want me to join Sanctuary...You&#39;ll...so the 
condition is...If I joined Sanctuary, Minako will be spared?&quot; Rei asked 
with disbelief

&quot;Straight to the point bright girl...But if you don&#39;t...&quot;

Rei&#39;s heart is slowly sinking

&quot;You&#39;ll...kill her...and many other people&quot;

--

-Back at Minako&#39;s Hotel Room-

&quot;Okay everything is fixed. And we&#39;re so ready this Saturday&quot; The fashion 
designer said

&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll go shopping tomorrow and I&#39;ll compare the textures of the 
blush-ons and lipsticks here in Tokyo. Want to come with me?&quot; The make 
up artist said

&quot;I&#39;d love to, but we&#39;ll do that in the afternoon, after we try all the 
wardrobes and test make-ups on Minako tomorrow morning&quot; The fashion 
designer replied

&quot;Okay it&#39;s settled. I wonder if Minako&#39;s coming too&quot;

&quot;Save your dreams, even the media men from Europe came all the away here 
just to get a scoop from Minako too, so I can&#39;t take the risks of 
exposing Minako any further. It might be too dangerous&quot; Wendy replied

&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re right&quot;

Minako came out of the room together with the head chief

&quot;It seems that Hino still isn&#39;t here&quot; The head chief said

&quot;She&#39;ll be back as soon as possible&quot;

All of the eyes turned to the pop star as she started to speak

&quot;Aino...&quot; Wendy whispered

&quot;She&#39;ll be back...I have to trust her, right big boss?&quot; Minako asked as 
she looked at the head chief

The head chief nodded

&quot;Yes, of course she will&quot;

The make-up artist stood up from her seat

&quot;Anybody wants to sleep now? I&#39;m a little tired because were from a 
flight you know&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m still not sleepy. But if you are then let&#39;s go to our room. Are you 
sleeping now too, Wendy?&quot; The fashion designer said as she looks from 
Minako to Wendy who was getting something from the fridge. She took out 
a can of ice cream. Minako was a bit confused on what her manager is 
doing

&quot;I don&#39;t think so. We&#39;ll still have our midnight snack&quot; Wendy said as 
she winked at Minako who nodded cheerfully

--

-Inside the taxi-

&quot;Hurry up mister, someone&#39;s waiting for me!&quot; Rei demanded

&quot;Hey, cool down missy! We&#39;ll get to your destination, and I can&#39;t just 
go over speeding on the road even in the midnight, you know?&quot; The taxi 
driver said

&quot;...Yeah, you&#39;re right. Gomen...Thank you for being patient and waiting 
for me&quot; Rei apologized as she massages her temples

&quot;You seemed so stressed out with your job as police, hmm? But I&#39;m glad 
you&#39;re safe, I was scared that something might happen to you and it 
might bother my conscience. Besides, no one will pay for your fare 
right?&quot; The taxi driver said as he let out a smile

Rei looked at the taxi driver from the rear mirror and saw the sincerity 
in his face. She smiled back

&#39;At least a taxi driver like him cared, thank you. May the kami bless 
you&#39;

--

-Few minutes passed-

&quot;You didn&#39;t eat much ice cream, Aino&quot; Wendy commented

&quot;It&#39;s because I&#39;m reserving my hunger&quot; Minako reasoned as she plays 
dreamily on her cup of ice cream

&quot;How about you head chief sir, don&#39;t you want a cup of ice cream?&quot; Wendy 
asked the head chief

&quot;I&#39;m sorry but I don&#39;t really eat that kind of food. I think that food 
doesn&#39;t suit my age&quot; The head chief chuckled

&quot;You&#39;re a little sensitive when it comes to age hmm, head chief sir?&quot; 
Wendy teased

&quot;Wha? It&#39;s not really that-&quot;

The doorbell sounded. The head chief stood up and checks the door to see 
who it was, but all of them in the room predicted that it was Rei behind 
the door

As the head chief opened the door they saw a very sweaty and breathless 
Rei

&quot;Hino, what on earth did just happen to you?&quot; The head chief asked

Rei grabbed the head chief&#39;s arm for support while her other hand on her 
chest. She took a fast glimpse at Minako, the pop star&#39;s face was 
miserable. She already knows something&#39;s wrong. Then she whispered to 
him

&quot;I&#39;ll--tell you--tomorrow...okay? First thing&#39;s--first&quot;

The head chief didn&#39;t press the issue and nodded

Rei stood straight and fixed herself from being breathless from running 
back to being a professional agent

&quot;I&#39;m sorry for making you worry. I went out to fix something and uh...I 
&#39;kinda forgot the about the time&quot; Rei said, but she couldn&#39;t look at 
Minako. She can only look at Wendy and the head chief

There was another deafening silence in that room. They are looking at 
each other&#39;s faces. Except that Rei can&#39;t look at her pop star lover. 
Wendy sighed and stood up from her sofa seat and walk towards the door

&quot;I&#39;ll visit Heather and the others on the other room to check their 
condition in there. I&#39;ll bring the ice cream with me, there&#39;s another 
one in the fridge&quot; Wendy said as she opens the door. The head chief 
catches up with her

&quot;I&#39;ll accompany you there Ms. Wendy. I&#39;ll be going off anyway. Hino, 
take care of Aino-san, okay? I&#39;ll lock the door for you&quot; The head chief 
said. Rei just nodded, still standing at her place

The door behind the agent closed with a soft click sound. Silence 
conquered the room between Minako and Rei

The pop star looked at the window where she was looking at before. Her 
thoughts deep, at the same time she is waiting for Rei to say something. 
But nothing sounded, not even a whisper

&quot;Rei...do I always have to be the one to make the first move?&quot; Minako 
weakly said

&quot;Minako...I...&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t read your mind Rei. That&#39;s why when it comes to something that 
involves you, I became an outcast. I just thought that you&#39;ll tell me 
everything because you love me and you trusted me so much&quot; Minako said 
as another tear escaped her eyes

Rei winced at Minako&#39;s voice, it was full of heartaches

&quot;I admit. I really wanted you to tell me everything that&#39;s happening on 
you. Especially this morning and before you just left a few hours ago, 
Rei I&#39;m not numb god damn it! Can&#39;t you still feel that I needed you 
this much?&quot; Minako yelled as she looked at Rei

Rei stood silent. Then tears started flowing down on her cheeks. She 
walked and approached the pop star

&quot;Minako...please don&#39;t say that...I know how you feel...but...telling me 
this...it hurts&quot; Rei said as she tried to hold back her tears

&quot;How come you&#39;re telling me it hur-&quot; Minako was stunned when Rei hugged 
her fiercely and rather a bit tightly

&quot;R-Rei?&quot; Is all that Minako can say

&quot;...I just want to save you...I don&#39;t want to lose you Minako...I need 
you so much too, I even need you now! They...they want to...I won&#39;t let 
them take you away from me! I&#39;m so sorry if I once again ignored you...I 
just want to make sure you&#39;re safe...that&#39;s all...that&#39;s all...Oh, I&#39;m 
so sorry Mina-chan, please don&#39;t get mad at me, I can&#39;t stand you being 
mad at me&quot; Rei said as she tightens her hug to her lover

Minako&#39;s mood changed from anger to worry. She never heard Rei talking 
like this, or imagined her to be like this scared. Rei is afraid of 
something...or someone

&quot;Hush Rei-chan...I&#39;m here for you. And no matter how angry or mad I am 
to you, I&#39;ll never let you go. I&#39;ll never leave you, because I can&#39;t 
live without you and I love you so much...&quot; The pop star said

Minako held Rei&#39;s chin and kissed her lover&#39;s lips mildly and long 
enough to calm her down. They looked at each other&#39;s eyes and leaned 
each other&#39;s forehead

&quot;I love you so much that I would do anything for you...even joining 
them&quot; Rei said absent-mindedly as she clings to Minako

&quot;Them? Rei-chan I guess you&#39;re hungry, you&#39;re already saying odd 
things...How about a midnight snack?&quot; Minako offered her lover

Rei nodded as she lean on Minako&#39;s shoulder

&quot;Hey, how about you rest in the sofa for a while, I can&#39;t prepare our 
snacks with your head leaning on my shoulder. Although I really wanted 
it, I think you needed a rest&quot; Said Minako as she assists her lover to 
the sofa to sit and rest

&quot;Oh, and Rei...&quot;

&quot;...What is it?&quot; Rei asked

&quot;Tell me what happened when you feel better okay?&quot; Minako said

&quot;...Okay&quot;
