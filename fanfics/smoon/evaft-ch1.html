<h1>Ever After</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/corvus.html">Corvus</a><br> </h2>
<pre>The power of the wind-tossed sea filled her mind, but could not 
wash away the stain on her soul.  As she stood on the rocky shore 
staring at the frothy slate-colored ocean, Ami could not truly 
feel the icy spray borne on the frigid wind.  In a desperate 
effort to rinse the corruption of death she filled herself with 
the sea&#39;s energy, but it wasn&#39;t working.

Since her arrival in this land Ami had come to accept the 
necessity of killing, in defense of kingdom, family and honor.  
She had accepted the necessity of killing, for others -- not for 
herself.  For her to claim a human life was anathema.  Yet she 
had done just that in defense of one whose sword had taken 
several lives over the past three years.  She had done just that 
in defense of Makoto, who had protected Ami with that bloody 
sword.

Makoto...  The blood could not stain her honorable soul.  Makoto, 
Ami&#39;s only tie to the world she had left behind.  They had been 
different people, before, in a world where hope still shone a 
silver ray of light.  It was a life long lost, and Ami had begun 
to give up hope of ever returning to it.  Makoto had accepted 
this new life early on, but Ami still held on.  The hold was 
weakening, day by misty day in this brooding, shrouded place.  
Had it not been for Makoto, Ami felt certain she would have lost 
her hold on herself as well.

The steady rhythm of the moody waves crashing and tumbling over 
the stones of the shore filtered through the ecstasy of Water&#39;s 
power as the ragged, dying heartbeat of a man, rust-pitted sword 
in hand, eyes wide in shock, blood transmuted to lethal poison by 
that same element&#39;s power.  Beat... beat...  Ami&#39;s hands, clad in 
gloves the lying white of purity, clenched into tight fists 
around the glittering, star-flecked black wood of the scepter she 
held.  The heartbeat became an accusation from which she could 
not hide.  A man had died because of her power.  His blood would 
stain her hands forever.

Ami&#39;s chin fell to touch her chest, clad as the rest of her in 
that lying white.  A brief fancy of the wind tossed her cape 
back, baring her gold-worked tunic, mid-thigh skirt and knee-high 
boots.  Once she would have worn a skirt and boots of blue, but 
not any more.  No longer was she Sailor Mercury.  That identity 
had been stripped away by her passage to this place.  Now Ami was 
a sorceress, mistress of the five elements: Water, Wood, Fire, 
Earth and Metal.  A sorceress who had struck a man down in the 
prime of his life.

Her hands loosened; the scepter slipped from her grasp and 
tumbled to the stony ground, the transparent globe at its head 
which contained the swirling, rainbow-hued ether striking first 
with a sharp crack.  Ami&#39;s eyes closed.  She searched deeper for 
solace in the element of Water, but the deeper she reached, the 
more Water reminded her of blood.

Lost as she was, Ami did not hear the footfalls until they 
reached the stones.  Without turning, she knew who it was; there 
was only one who would dare approach her, surrounded as she was 
by the mystique of a wielder of sorcery.  Makoto, clad in her 
wood-brown tunic and trousers, hunter-green cloak revealing only 
the barest glimpse of her beautiful face and the handle of her 
deadly, curved sword.  Makoto, her only friend.  Makoto, who 
loved her.

That thought was enough to pull Ami away from the sea of blood, 
so that she found herself staring at the whitecaps in the 
distance.  But she could not turn.  This violation would not let 
her face Makoto, not now.  Even if Ami weren&#39;t terrified of the 
thought of surrendering herself to the love she saw in her 
friend&#39;s emerald eyes every time their gazes touched, she could 
not bear to think of what she might see in Makoto&#39;s eyes now.  
What would she see there -- hate?  Revulsion?  Pity?  Worse yet, 
would she see the same love?  Would that love be so strong that 
it would survive even this?  She could never be worthy of a love 
so strong, especially not now.

Ami could not feel Makoto&#39;s thoughts, else she would have felt 
Makoto&#39;s overpowering need for Ami simply to turn and look at 
her.  Underneath her verdant cloak, Makoto&#39;s left hand clutched 
the long handle of her curved sword.  She stopped a pace behind 
and beside Ami.  Words she dared not speak tightened her chest.  
If only she could overcome her fear, reach out and touch the one 
she adored...  But the fear held her fast like a spell, fear for 
Ami that threatened to crush the life out of her.

Their arrival in this world had been a confused jumble of noise 
and light.  A horrible wrench, a strange explosion of darkness 
before Makoto&#39;s eyes, pain through every nerve in her body, then 
a separation from all sensation.  Sensation had returned like a 
hard slap and she had found herself lying next to Ami on cold, 
damp stones in the center of a ring of chanting figures in snowy 
robes.  Makoto&#39;s only thought then had been to make sure Ami was 
all right.  The smaller, blue-haired girl had been unharmed, and 
was just as lost as Makoto.  

Makoto had taken Ami into her arms instinctively, and in that 
moment she had sworn to protect Ami from all harm.  Since that 
day Makoto had held herself to that pledge, using her newfound 
abilities to keep Ami safe.  Ami might never accept her love, but 
that didn&#39;t matter to Makoto, so long as Ami was never hurt.

But how could she protect Ami from this?  The magic-weilders in 
this world weren&#39;t bound by any oaths, but most of them refrained 
from doing harm with their awesome powers.  Ami had held to that 
ideal, using her sorcery to shield Makoto in battle and to heal 
the wounded.  But now...?

The melee had started as many did, desperate brigands erupting 
from the mist and thick growth to either side of the narrow, 
soggy road: highwaymen set on taking what they could from the 
royal ambassador&#39;s party of which Makoto and Ami were a part.  
Makoto&#39;s sword had almost leapt into her hands of its own accord, 
so fast was she in drawing the steel.  Even as she cut down the 
first assailant she felt a twinge of pity.  The brigands were 
poorly armed and were obviously hungry.  If she thought the men 
would listen Makoto would have cried for their surrender and 
given them her own rations of the party&#39;s food.  But one thing 
Makoto had learned quickly in this world was that desperate men 
with blood thundering in their ears heard no words of mercy.

Two more men fell to her blade, perhaps thinking Makoto a weaker 
target because of her sex.  Then there had been a soul-killing 
shriek that could only have come from Ami.  Makoto turned in time 
to see a brigand, his already blotchy skin turning sickly shades 
of red and purple, clutch his throat and fall to the ground, 
where he died, twitching and retching.  Ami&#39;s scepter had been 
leveled at the man.  The few remaining assailants lost what 
courage their hunger had lent them and crashed back into the 
dense forest, but all Makoto saw was the devastation on Ami&#39;s 
face.

That was three hours ago.  The ambassador had halted the party at 
the earliest possible place and ordered them to make camp and 
tend the wounded.  Ami had ridden in silence, unmolested by the 
rest of the group and not responding to Makoto&#39;s gentle pleas.  
As the rest attended their duties, Ami had slipped away, 
unwilling -- or unable -- to summon her power for healing stabs 
and slashes.  It had been several minutes before Makoto noticed 
Ami was gone, but it wasn&#39;t hard to follow the trail the 
blue-haired sorceress had left.

Now here she stood, gazing on the white-shrouded form of the one 
she loved, unable to speak.  If only Ami would say something...

The sorceress lifted her gloved hands from her sides and stared 
at them.  Makoto knew, now, what Ami was thinking.  Anger swelled 
in her breast, outrage that such a noble soul as Ami&#39;s could be 
subject to such agony for simply defending a friend from certain 
death.  &quot;Look at me,&quot; Makoto whispered, but Ami did not hear.  
Ami began to turn... away.

Makoto reached out and took firm hold of Ami&#39;s left elbow.  Ami 
looked at Makoto for the first time, sapphire eyes stricken, and 
tried to pull her arm from Makoto&#39;s grip, but she could not.  
Makoto&#39;s free hand pulled the green hood back from her face, 
freeing her cascade of chestnut hair to fly in the frigid breeze, 
and their gazes met.

It was still there, stronger than ever.  The blow was like a 
physical impact, driving the will and the breath from Ami.  Her 
struggles ceased.  Three waves broke on the shore and retreated, 
one for each year of their exile, as they looked into each 
other&#39;s souls, unblinking.

Unwilling to bow to the fear any more, Makoto loosened her grip 
on Ami&#39;s elbow and gently removed the white glove that covered 
the elegant hand and forearm.  Then she lifted Ami&#39;s bare hand to 
her cheek and covered it with her own.  No blood could stain that 
hand.  No blood could ever make Makoto not want this touch.

&quot;No blood,&quot; was all Makoto said.

A tide rose to cover Ami&#39;s soul like the power of the ocean, but 
what the sea could not wash away, those two words did.  The 
violation and the pain faded from her as if they had never been, 
leaving her as pure as the white she wore.  The words took 
something else as well -- fear.  Within those emerald eyes Ami 
saw that no matter what happened, she would be worthy of the love 
Makoto felt.  Slowly Ami withdrew her hand from Makoto&#39;s cheek, 
but only to slip her arms around the swordswoman and draw her 
close.

Makoto returned the embrace without a word.  She had sworn to 
protect Ami from all harm, and she would forever do just that.

Author&#39;s Note:

I never expected to return to Sailor Moon after I left the corpse 
of a horrible action/adventure series SM fic behind me, but here 
it is, only my third foray into shoujo-ai.  The first was a pure 
lemon (&quot;For Love&quot;, Gunbuster) and the second a piece of WAFFy 
songfic fluff (&quot;Another Time&quot;, Final Fantasy 8).  I&#39;m not a 
Sailor Moon fan any more (are you listening, Kevin Callahan?) but 
I am forced to admit that I am still an Ami and Makoto fan.

This short piece is the written form of an image I saw one night.  
That image was inspired by a good friend, John F. Martin (aka 
FurrySaint), and this fic-piece was named by him and is dedicated 
to him.

Eventually this piece will become part of a longer fic which I am 
naming &quot;Mirror of Your Mask&quot;.  The world and situation in which 
Ami and Makoto have found themselves begs exploration.
