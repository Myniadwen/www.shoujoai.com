	&#147;&#133; And so, on just that one night of the whole year, if the sky 
is clear, the cowherd and the weaver are able to cross the Milky Way to 
meet.  Two lovers reunited in the stars.&#148;
	The little girl sighed at the tragic romanticism of it all, along 
with most of the other little girls sitting around her, as the woman in 
the pale yellow yukata finished telling the story of Tanabata.  The 
woman smiled at all the children, then playfully shooed them back off 
to the game booths and food stands that had been set up for the 
festival.
	Kei stood with the rest of them, her brother, Ti, close beside 
her.  This was one of the things she liked best about humans:  They 
knew how to tell a good story.  Even better, they knew how to throw a 
good party to go along with those stories.  Kei looked around happily 
at all the bright colors that decorated the festival grounds.  Not just 
those of the lights that lit up the night along all the booths, but 
those of the people as well.  A few of them had come in plain old 
shorts, but most had dressed up in their yukatas the way they were 
supposed to.  Just like she had.  While all those pretty colors make 
Kei happy, she thought her yukata was the best, with its golden dragon 
pattern flowing over red silk.  It was the prettiest of all, and 
matched perfectly the red bow tied between the little cat ears even 
Shin thought looked cute on her human form.
	Still wrapped up in the human woman&#146;s storytelling, Kei stared up 
at the stars.  &#147;How terribly romantic,&#148; she sighed happily once again.
	&#147;How boring, you mean,&#148; complained her little brother as he 
walked along beside her.  He picked at the dark blue of his yukata and 
complained further, &#147;I wore this stupid costume for you because you 
said you would take me to play games and get something to eat.  But so 
far, we haven&#146;t done anything but watch people and listen to that 
stupid story over and over.  And you better take me to see the 
fireworks, or I&#146;m telling Shin you lied.&#148;
	Kei practically ignored Ti, waving a hand dismissively at him.  
Answering in a bored tone, she said, &#147;If you wanted to play games, you 
should have stayed with Shin and Kai.  So don&#146;t whine at me.  But I am 
getting hungry.  What do you want to eat?  Ti?&#148;  Kei stopped walking 
and turned around when she didn&#146;t get a response.  An annoyed look 
crossed her face when she saw her brother standing several steps behind 
her and staring off at something.  Walking back to him, she said, &#147;Hey, 
I was talking to you.&#148;
	Ti raised his finger and pointed over in the direction of the 
game booths.  &#147;Isn&#146;t that your human?&#148;  Then a bright smile broke out 
on his face.  &#147;And look!  There&#146;s mine, too!&#148;
	Kei quickly grabbed her brother and put a hand over his mouth to 
keep him from moving or getting any unwanted attention.  Then she 
closed her eyes and concentrated as hard as she could for several 
seconds before both of them disappeared in a faint flash of light.
	When the children reappeared, they were several inches above the 
branch Kei had been aiming for.  Kei was able to land and steady 
herself without too much trouble.  However, the only thing that kept Ti 
from tumbling through the leaves after their unexpected trip was Kei&#146;s 
grip on his yukata.
	Kei hauled Ti onto the branch and watched the people he had 
pointed out, while Ti clung desperately to the branch and tried to 
catch his breath.  Her human, Minako, was standing at the basketball 
game with the Mako-chan human and the tall blonde whose name Kei didn&#146;t 
know.  Ti&#146;s two humans were also with them, and the aqua colored one 
who had gotten the blonde so angry at Kai the last time they&#146;d met.  
The two little ones looked excited as Mako-chan and the blonde gave 
each other challenging glances and then paid the man at the booth.  
Ti&#146;s Hotaru put her soda cup into a holder on the pushcart thing they 
had with them and reached quickly into a bag with pastel alphabet 
blocks on it to pull out a camera.  Just as two basketballs were set 
before the opponents, her Minako reached into the pushcart to get 
something.
	Kei&#146;s eyes widened as Ti leaned over her shoulder and laughed at 
what he saw.  &#147;Aw, how cute!  They have a puppy!&#148; exclaimed the little 
boy.
	Again, Kei&#146;s hand quickly covered Ti&#146;s mouth.  &#147;Shh!&#148; she hissed 
at him.  &#147;We don&#146;t want them to find us.  And besides, that&#146;s not a 
puppy, stupid.  Humans don&#146;t have puppies.  They have kittens,&#148; 
announced Kei definitively right before she turned back to watching 
them.
	Ti sat there looking as if he was trying to decide whether to be 
angry for being called stupid or dubious over Kei&#146;s proclamation about 
humans and kittens, and which one he should be first.  While his mind 
deliberated, Minako held the tiny baby in front of her so he could 
watch the two players.  He was cute, Kei thought.  His eyes were big 
and blue as he took in what was happening before him, and the little 
blue trucks on his jumper made his eyes stand out even more.  Kei had 
always favored blue eyes, just like the ones on her Minako.  It was a 
shame the tuft of hair on the baby&#146;s head was brown, though.  If it had 
been golden, he would have been perfect.
	Before she could think on the little human kitten any further, 
the rest of the human group came walking up.  Kei recognized all of 
them except for the man with Minako&#146;s friend, Usagi.  Minako smiled 
when she saw them, and Kei scowled at the brunette who moved to stand 
beside her with cotton candy and a caramel apple in hand.  Minako 
handed the baby off to the Ami human, who cuddled and cooed at him, 
then took the cotton candy from her companion.
	Without completely losing her scowl, Kei said to Ti, &#147;Come on.  
Let&#146;s get out of here before the ugly one senses us.  If she does, Shin 
will make us leave.  And don&#146;t say anything about seeing them.  We 
probably won&#146;t be allowed to stay if you do.&#148;
	Ti nodded, and this time when Kei transported them, he was ready 
for it.  The landing on the other side of the festival grounds wasn&#146;t 
much smoother than most of Kei&#146;s landings, but at least she&#146;d finally 
figured out how to do it without getting a bunch of attention from the 
people around them.  Kei took off running ahead of him, having spotted 
their older brothers.  Ti sighed and hurried after her.  He caught up 
to them and fell in beside Kai.  Kei was resting contentedly on Shin&#146;s 
back, drinking over his shoulder from the straw he held up to her.
	When Shin saw Ti, he grinned down at the boy.  &#147;Did you two have 
fun?&#148;
	&#147;Yeah,&#148; answered Ti without much enthusiasm.  &#147;But I want to play 
some games.  Can we, Shin?&#148;
	Shin reached into his pocket and pulled out his stash of play 
money for the boys.  Tossing it to Kai, he said, &#147;Go on, do some 
damage.  But don&#146;t cheat so much that someone notices.&#148;
	Kai smirked, then ran on ahead with a much happier Ti.
	Shin continued along at a leisurely pace.  Still on his back, Kei 
tapped the top of his head and opened her mouth, effectively requesting 
more to drink.  Shin took a sip, then shook the cup.  &#147;It&#146;s empty.  
I&#146;ll get you some more when we catch up to the boys.&#148;
	&#147;Okay,&#148; answered Kei.  She rested her chin on Shin&#146;s shoulder, 
and after a few seconds of being carried in silence, said, &#147;Shin, I&#146;ve 
been really good lately.&#148;
	Shin almost laughed.  With one corner of his mouth turned up into 
a smirk, he replied, &#147;I suppose you have.&#148;
	&#147;If I ask for something, will I be allowed to have it?&#148;
	&#147;That depends on what it is.&#148;
	Kei smiled innocently.  &#147;I&#146;d like to have a new pet.&#148;
	Shin frowned and noted both the rumble from Kei&#146;s tummy and the 
fact they were passing the goldfish booth right that moment.  &#147;If I win 
you a goldfish, do you promise to take care of it and not eat it?&#148;
	Kei giggled at him.  &#147;Oh, don&#146;t be so silly.  Besides, I don&#146;t 
want a goldfish.  I want a kitten.&#148;</pre>
