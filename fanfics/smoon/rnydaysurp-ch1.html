<h1>Rainy Day Surprise</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/sjaye.html">Sara Jaye</a><br> </h2>
<DIV>Rain pounded on every surface of the house like miniature wrecking ba=
lls 
threatening to rip it down. This was the worst storm Tokyo had seen in yea=
rs, 
and everyone was locked away in their houses fearing for their lives like=
 the 
world was ending.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Minako sighed, lying back on her bed and kicking a leg into the air.=
 She'd 
read all her manga, she'd wasted an hour trying to draw. She was so bored=
 she'd 
even finished her homework and organized her closet for lack of anything=
 better 
to do.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>As if that wasn't bad enough, the storm was so bad her mother refused=
 to 
let anyone leave the house; if they didn't drown or get blown away or 
electrocuted, they'd catch pneumonia. Minako had unsuccessfully tried to=
 argue 
that a quick bike ride to a friend's house wouldn't kill her before throwi=
ng up 
her hands in defeat and going off to her room. Each member of the family=
 had 
staked out their own little part of the house; normally the family would=
 make 
shadow puppets or read stories when the power went out, but everyone seeme=
d to 
be in a particularly foul mood today.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The solitude and overall gloomy feeling around the house were beginni=
ng to 
drive Minako crazy. She wouldn't have minded being stuck in the house if=
 the 
phone was working, then at least she could call Rei. <EM>It's not fair, th=
e 
weekends are supposed to be our special time together. Sure, we see each=
 other 
during the week, but those are Senshi meetings and study sessions, not exa=
ctly 
the best date spots.</EM></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>She closed her eyes and tried to pretend she was curled up on the cou=
ch 
with Rei in front of a roaring fire or a romantic movie. (Rei refused to=
 admit 
it, but Minako knew her taste in movies was rubbing off on her) She pictur=
ed 
them huddled under a big, fluffy blanket, talking about anything, Minako=
 idly 
braiding strands of their hair together. She could almost smell the faint=
 aroma 
of woodsmoke and lilies that always seemed to surround Rei, feel the softn=
ess of 
her hair on her fingertips.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>A crash of thunder shattered the illusion, and Minako growled.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"I'm going to lose it if I have to be stuck here any longer!" she sai=
d 
aloud. "That does it, I don't care what Mom says. I'm going to see her."</=
DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>She was about to open the window to sneak out when there was a knock=
 on the 
door.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Now that's random. Who'd be crazy enough to be out in this?" she mut=
tered. 
"Might as well see who it is." She padded downstairs, answered the door,=
 and 
gasped. A soaking wet Rei stood on the front steps, shaking out her 
umbrella.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Sorry to drop in on you like this, but you weren't answering the pho=
ne and 
I got worried."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Minako could have cried with relief.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"I was just on my way to see <EM>you!</EM> Get in here before you dro=
wn!" 
she laughed, pulling Rei inside. "Does your grandfather know you left?"</D=
IV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"I left a note. He was sleeping when I left, and I didn't wake to wak=
e 
him," Rei said. Minako's parents rushed into the foyer just then, having=
 heard 
the commotion.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Rei! Oh, I'll ask questions later, let me get you a towel before you=
 catch 
cold! Kenichi, don't just stand there, go light a fire in the den!" Rumiko=
 
ordered, then glanced towards her daughter. "We'll let you have the den to=
 
yourselves while Rei's here, but don't make a mess," she warned.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Don't worry, we won't," Minako sighed. Even her mother's usually 
irritating neat-freak nature couldn't ruin her good mood.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>*</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Minako sighed happily, snuggling closer to Rei and listening to the=
 roar of 
the fire mingle with the sound of the rain. Her parents had agreed to 
let-actually, they'd <EM>insisted</EM> that Rei stay the night; the storm=
 wasn't 
about to let up anytime soon and Rei going out in it a second time wasn't=
 an 
option.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"You don't know how glad I am you came," she said. "I was about to go=
 
crazy!"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"So was I. I heard the storm was especially bad in your part of town=
 and I 
was so worried," Rei said. "At least now I know why you didn't answer the=
 
phone."</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"That was what nearly drove me crazy. The power probably won't be bac=
k for 
another day," Minako said, sighing dramatically. "Would you believe I was=
 so 
bored I did my homework?"</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Rei laughed, pulling the blanket tighter around them.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"Looks like I came here just in time," she said, placing a chaste kis=
s on 
Minako's lips. Minako made a small, contented noise, braiding a few strand=
s of 
their hair together.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>"You sure did."</DIV>
