<span name="storytext" id="storytext">
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Congratulations<br />
</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">It  had taken the new lovers nearly the entirety of the day to leave  Minako’s bedroom. Although they’d made the decision to return home that  night - Minako’s retreat to London hadn’t exactly been planned, after  all - inevitably, <em>something</em> always came up to derail the progress of actually getting to the airport for the flight they’d booked.</span></p>
</span><p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Neither one of them were complaining, but the plane full of people they’d nearly held up might have.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  two women shouldered themselves into the cabin, squeezing past the  airline attendants in their final check of the passengers. Thankfully,  their seats were in the corner of the first class section, and with  only one carry on bag – Rei hadn’t flown out of Tokyo with a single  belonging beyond her purse and passport – the two women were tucked  away in their seats with little effort, if amid plenty of whispers and  giggles shared between them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer readjusted her wide  brimmed hat over her eyes. It was common for her to fly in and out of  Heathrow undetected. Her music was popular in Europe, if not as much so  as it was in her hometown, but she always took the precaution of  traveling incognito. It was just as they were clicking their seatbelts  across their waists that the musical tune of Minako’s Teletia S sang  from her purse.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A passing stewardess gave the women a disapproving frown, but the plane hadn’t taken off yet and so the singer took the call.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan?”  She answered knowingly. She’d only just listened to the seven or eight  messages her Princess had left on her voice mail over the past day and  a half on their way to their airport, but hadn’t yet gotten the chance  to call her back.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako-chan, I’ve been so worried about you! I’ve left you so many messages!” “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Ne, Usagi-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And Rei-chan too! I’ve been calling her for the past twenty-four hours! I’m starting to get worried!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Usagi-chan,  it’s okay, she’s with me.” Minako had been quick enough that time, and  in the silence that ensued, she could imagine the gears as they turned  inside her Princess’ head.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“With you?” She asked. “In London?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Mmm hmm.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh!” A slight pause ensued, and then she responded with a more knowing, “Oohhhh.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko in question sighed and rolled her eyes. Usagi had only been  screaming and she’d heard each and every word. She snatched the phone  from her girlfriend’s hand testily. “Would you relax Usagi?  Everything’s just fine.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Her barking reassurance resulted in a  relieved squeal from the woman on the other end of the line.  ”Everything?” Usagi asked, “then what about the Priestess position?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”I declined it.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Look, I’ll explain later.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”But my party…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei couldn’t help but smile. She caught Minako’s caramel eyes knowingly. “I think we’ve got something else we can celebrate.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What!? What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I’m  not going to tell you yet.” The miko winked at the singer. “I’m going  to tell everyone at once. So plan a party. Tomorrow night. Eight o’  clock at the Crown.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But Rei-” A million questions hung off Usagi’s tongue, but neither woman would answer them.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Smiling evilly, Minako snatched her phone back from Rei. “Got a plane to catch. Bye, Usagi-chan!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  click of the phone as it shut and the giggling of the women as they  shared in Usagi’s frustration were drowned by the roar of the plane’s  engines as the hunk of steel zoomed down the runway and took to the air  effortlessly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The two women fell into a comfortable silence,  sitting shoulder to shoulder in their big leather seats, but a couple  hours into their trip, somewhere above Germany, Minako couldn’t help  but notice that Rei was looking so thoughtfully out the window. She  debated with herself for some time, but finally, with a gentle hand on  Rei’s own, she settled for bluntness.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Are you sure you want to  go through with telling the others?” Minako’s quiet voice mingled with  the drone of the engines. “We could wait, you know.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">As if she’d been forcefully pulled back from another world, Rei blinked. “Huh? Why?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer titled her head. “Because you look like something’s still bothering you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko faltered; the singer had misread her hesitation; it had nothing to  do with revealing their relationship to their friends. It had taken her  years, but she’d learned to be comfortable with expressing her concerns  to Minako – more so these past few weeks - but even still, getting  started was never an easy task. “You were right,” she began, “I can’t  stay a miko forever.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Derailing her previous train of thought,  Minako frowned in confusion for a moment until Rei’s words registered,  and suddenly, she was certain that the words she was hearing in her  head were the same that Rei was hearing in hers, words she had said to  her girlfriend from a day earlier…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“<em>So</em><em> what will you do now? You can’t stay a miko forever.”</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer laced her fingers between the other woman’s. “You’re worried about your future, Rei?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  miko looked down at their clasped hands in acknowledgement. “Everyone  has their futures planned out but me. For someone who only ever focused  on their future instead of their past, how ironic is that?” Her words  bordered on bitter.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Rei,” Minako’s voice was scolding and it  served to pull the other woman’s eyes back to hers, “if you think that  your faith will be less a part of life just because you’ve chosen not  to be a part of the clergy, you’re totally wrong.” The miko blinked in  shock and the singer continued. “Shinto is part of who you are; that  will never change, no matter what you decide to do! That spirituality  of your faith will only guide you in whatever path you chose to take  now.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Not for the first time, Rei was in awe of the leadership  that her former commander could display so effortlessly. “But… what  path do I <em>take</em>?” She looked away from Minako once more,  disgusted with herself. “I’ve never felt like this before. I have no  idea what to do with myself.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako had an answer. She leaned  forward, but treaded carefully. She knew to come on too strong would be  to push at Rei’s pride – for always being so determined and steadfast,  to feel like she’d had her options taken away from her had obviously  been a blow to the miko, and the singer wanted Rei to understand that  she wasn’t offering her this suggestion out of pity.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">”You know,”  she began gently, “you made a suggestion to me not long ago that I  totally wrote off.” Despite herself, the miko looked back to Minako in  question. “We were at a coffee shop, and I was complaining to you about  how my career was getting to me and how I wanted to concentrate more on  my charity works.” The singer snorted, and for a second, she steepled  her hands together and found some interest in them before continuing.  “And you had the <em>nerve</em> to tell me to put my singing career on hold so I could focus on the charity if that’s what I wanted to do.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  frowned, remembering the conversation. Minako looked to her and smiled.  “It’s one of the things I’ve always loved about you; that ability to  get to the heart of the matter and the courage you have to just <em>do</em> what you want to do.” She trailed off for a moment, her fingers  returning to and tightening around the other woman’s hand. “I want to  be more like that, Rei. I want to be more like you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako, I-”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That  night we spent at my office, going over the charity’s paperwork, I  watched the way you took control. I couldn’t believe how well we worked  together, the progress we made in those few short hours. And I couldn’t  help but wonder what kind of impact we’d make if we could work on the  charity together. I knew then that you’d be perfect for the job… but  remember that comment you made about finding ‘some corporate snob’ to  run the program?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako…”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Well, you may not be very <em>corporate</em>, but you <em>are</em> a…” for the first time, a knowing smile tugged at Rei’s lips, expecting  the verbal barb that should have followed, and when it didn’t come, she  was floored, “very good candidate for the position.” Minako finished  smugly. “And if I can get you to work with me, then maybe I can find a  way to ease back on my singing and work more on the charity like I want  to.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The miko snorted, almost not trusting her voice. “I don’t think Saitou-san will be happy to hear that.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  singer shrugged, and for once, Rei saw a hint of selfishness that  Minako had desperately lacked. And it made her happy to see. “It was  you who taught me to live for myself.” Minako said, “And I need to make  sure I keep pursuing that.” The singer snorted. “Shacho. Could you even  imagine working in the same office as him?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei shrugged fondly. “He <em>was</em> my ticket to London.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  smiled knowingly, making a mental note to give her surrogate older  brother a big hug for that one. She almost hadn’t believed it when Rei  had told her the night before. Perhaps the three of them working  together wouldn’t be so terrible after all.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So, I’m not letting you off the hook.” Minako leaned forward, squeezing Rei’s hand. “What do you say? Will you take the job?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  hesitated; it wasn’t that she didn’t like the idea; quite the contrary,  but her pride battled with her desires. “I don’t have much to offer.”  Her voice was cold. “I have no formal job skills, no money to speak of,  not even very much in the way of belongings. I’d… I’d feel like I’m  taking advantage of you.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The singer nodded and smiled at the  answer she’d been expecting. She leaned closer to quietly whisper in  Rei’s ear. “You can take advantage of me <em>any</em> time.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Minako,” Rei warned testily, “I’m being serious.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“So  am I!” The conviction in the singer’s melodious voice would not be  denied. “Well, except I was teasing about the whole taking advantage of  me thing.” She trailed off experimentally. “Not really.” She added.  “Yes I am.” She amended further at Rei’s glare. “Okay, okay, lighten  up!” She exclaimed. “Honestly, Rei, you’d be a huge asset to the  charity. How can you say you have no job skills when your role as a  miko was to serve the public? I’ve seen you in action, I’ve seen the  impact that just a couple hours of your advice did for me when we  worked together a couple weeks ago! How could you <em>not</em> be the best person for the job?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei  took a deep breath. Could all the loose ends in her life really be tied  into so perfect a knot? Could she really be this lucky? <em>‘We’ve already found each </em>other<em>, but could this really be the path to both of us finding what we really want to </em>do<em> with our lives?’</em> One look at Minako’s excitedly hopeful caramel eyes cinched the deal.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I… accept.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Yes!”  Minako’s free hand turned into a fist clutched excitedly below her chin  in victory. But then she paused in thoughtful consideration. “You know,  Usagi-chan’s going to be jealous that you’re working for me. She <em>is</em> my number one fan, after all.” She noticed Rei’s weary glance and smiled mischievously. “Maybe she could be your assistant!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I quit.” Rei crossed her arms over her chest in mock indignation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Minako  slugged her girlfriend lightly in the arm, and laughing, the former  miko threw that arm around the slightly smaller woman’s shoulders and  pulled her towards her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I <em>think</em> it’s pretty obvious at this point.” Makoto commented dryly.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“But we don’t know for sure.” Usagi reinforced.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It’s… a pretty safe bet, Usagi-chan.” Ami nodded sagely.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Five  minutes to eight, the three women sat around the small table of their  secret base, staring listlessly at all five feet of a long, blank  banner that seemed to only mock the former Princess of the Moon Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Then what would I write?” Usagi wailed. “‘Congratulations on your lesbian relationship!’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I don’t think that sounds very… sensitive.” Ami guessed.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“’We support your togetherness!’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Lame.” Makoto balked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Oh! How about, ‘We want to be your maids of honor!’?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No!” The former senshi of ice and lightening shouted simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Fine,  fine.” Usagi relented. Shrugging, she put her marker to the banner, and  busily scribbled something more appropriate. Ami and Makoto nodded  their acceptance, and after helping their Princess hang it above the  table, the three took their seats once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Finally, the tell  tale sound of a hand clasping a door handle shushed the three women at  the table, and silence ensued as all eyes turned to the door that  opened painfully slowly to reveal Rei and Minako.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a  moment’s hesitation; the two new lovers standing hand in hand on the  platform of the raised staircase, looking down at the three women who  had been their closest friends; their only real family. Once, they had  stood by each others’ sides through the end of the world. But would  they support <em>this</em>?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Sucking in a deep breath, Rei  stiffened and stood tall. Minako squeezed her hand, providing her the  support, the extra push she needed to break the room’s silence…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  screech of chair legs scratching against the hard floor accompanied  Usagi as she leapt from her seat, and it was her boisterous voice that  shattered the silence first. “Congratulations!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Rei snorted. “They… knew.” She whispered.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">An equally stunned Minako applied gentle pressure to the small of Rei’s back. “Apparently, we were the only ones that didn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  cheers of the three women filled the room, and as Rei and Minako  descended the staircase and were met with hugs from their friends,  their eyes finally found a hastily scribbled banner that hung from the  ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The sign read simply, ‘Congratulations, Rei and Minako, we love you!’</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Author’s Notes:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Eight  months of writing, three months of posting, and it’s over! It’s finally  over! But at the same time, I’m so sad! It was a joy to write this, and  it was an even greater joy to share it with all of you. </span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">So… what do you all think, now that it’s over?</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Don’t  think you’ve seen the last of me, though. I’ve got an entire AU Silver  Millennium in the works, titled ‘A Single Voice’. The emphasis centers  on Rei and Minako, with some Ami and Makoto and all the other standard  pairings. I’ve written fourteen out of about eighteen or twenty  chapters and should start posting that in a few weeks.  Be there!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">OOO</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Preview, A Single Voice:</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A single voice shattered the stillness of the desert.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Martian  Warrior!” The language of the red planet felt as coarse and grainy to  the foreigner’s tongue as the invasive red sand, yet she projected her  voice into the oppressive heat. “Why have you strayed so far from the  field of battle?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The figure she had called to in the distance  paused, but only momentarily; it was a second’s hesitation before the  small, red pony resumed its course, urged on by a white clad rider.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Venus-sama,”  an aide broke rank and pulled near to his leader, cautious to remain a  half pace behind his commander’s horse, “I believe she is not just a  warrior, but a Priestess of this planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The woman’s blue eyes  hardened. It was the aide’s only clue to discern his leader’s thoughts,  for the customary Martian attire she wore not only shielded her face  from the harsh desert elements, but also hid her normally expressive  features from view.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">He had no time to react to his commander’s  whims. In a flourish, her white steed had reared onto its back legs and  galloped forward in one fluid motion, devouring the distance that  separated himself and his rider from their target with thundering  hooves and flared nostrils.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Venusian drew her agile stallion  to a sliding halt in front of the small, sturdy pony. The shaggy  creature’s wild, barely tamed eyes widened as he found his passage  blocked. They were eyes that mirrored his master’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>Violet eyes?’</em> Trapped in the Martian’s gaze, the Venusian’s anger slipped and she  found it hard to tap back into, though she managed well enough.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“You  are a Priestess are you not? I’m here to help you and your people.” The  woman raised a hand towards her head and was unsurprised to find the  Martian’s own dart for the hilt of her sword, passing over her long  range bow and arrow also strapped to her person. The foreign commander  didn’t allow this defensive reaction to alarm her. Instead, she pulled  the concealing Martian headpiece from her face. Her long golden hair  falling freely to her waist, her upturned nose thrust into the air, it  was her confident smile that shone the brightest.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Why don’t we join forces?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess hesitated, though whether it be from the foreigner’s gesture  of friendship so brazenly displayed by the removal of her headpiece, or  the incredible beauty that was revealed through that trusting act, she  wasn’t sure. Long moments passed slowly, the only movements were the  occasional swish of a horse’s tail and the unrelenting heat waves that  rippled across the sands.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“No.” She finally replied, and with a  slight nudge of her left leg, her pony turned to the right and began to  plod off once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">There was a rustle of shifting sands and the Martian was unsurprised to find the Venusian blocking her path once more.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“Do  you know what you’re turning down?” The woman barked, anger sparkling  in those blue eyes. How dare this little barbarian ignore her!</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Priestess found herself sighing. This was not the first diplomat to  waltz onto her planet with a romantic notion of helping a fractured  nation.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“We can help you in your fight against the youma!”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">But in <em>this</em> woman, the Martian sensed a determination and fierceness that went far  beyond her delicate beauty, and she felt the smallest amount of  interest stir within her.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“What do you know of the youma?” The Priestess’ voice was raw and quiet, as though it hadn’t seen much use.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  know that they’ve been ravaging your planet for the past several years  and that they’re gaining in numbers, slowly wiping out your peoples. “</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“And how does that matter to you?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“It doesn’t.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The  Martian glared – the comment had only served to amplify her mistrust  but the Venusian seemed to show little regret for her harsh words and  her cerulean eyes only hardened.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“That is, it <em>didn’t</em>.” The foreigner clarified with a deep growl. “Not until those monsters starting showing up on <em>my</em> planet.”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">This  shred of honesty and display of sheer determination seemed to have the  desired effect. This woman had a people, a planet worth protecting,  just like the Priestess herself. Finally, the Martian’s hand loosened  from the hilt of her weapon. Slowly, she returned the other woman’s  gesture and lifted her own headpiece, releasing wild, unbound raven  hair that reached the tattered leather of her pony’s saddle, and she  was not so blind to notice the other woman openly staring at her own  appearance as much as she had discreetly admired the other’s.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">“I  want to know everything,” the golden haired woman demanded, “when they  first arrived, how quickly they multiplied, where they came from, what  their powers are…” she paused, her tightened fists releasing slowly,  “will you help me?”</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">The Martian frowned. This woman… talked too much. She was brash. Irrational…</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">Suddenly,  the Priestess’ pony shuddered underneath her and her hand darted to his  neck in a calming manner, though the emotion she felt was far from it.</span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">‘<em>They’re here.’</em></span></p>
<p><span name="storytext" id="storytext2">A  scream pierced the thick air, slicing through the dry heat, and both  women turned in its direction - the Venusian’s traveling party. The  group of twenty some men and women were at arms; drawing swords against  a dozen youma the size of horses; huge, lumbering brown monsters with  red, beady eyes and too many teeth.</span></p>
