<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 2 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&#147; Where is she? It&#146;s been two days!&#148; Serena paced back and forth in 
the newly existing portal room. 

&#147; Serena! I miss Terri as much as you miss Darien, but I&#146;m not pacing 
back and forth. Sit down before I melt your sneakers!&#148; Rei was 
becoming more than dizzy from Serena&#146;s pacing. 

&#147; Fine!&#148; Serena sat down just as a large 10 point star doorway 
appeared. Out of the swirling silver mist came Terri. She smiled as 
Rei hugged her before anyone else even got up. 

&#147; Hello Rei. Miss me?&#148; Rei looked up at her grinning girlfriend. 
Immediately blushing and straightening as the others giggled.

&#147; Lets do all the &#146;Hi&#146;s&#146; on Terrestrial. Since this is your first time 
through this type of portal go in by two&#146;s. It&#146;s quick, though some 
fast air will go by once.&#148; Terri went through the portal with Rei. The 
other&#146;s went through with their own counterparts. Except Serena &amp; 
Hotaru. Since Hotaru&#146;s counterpart had yet to be born. (later in the 
story ppl.)

Stepping through the portal the girls felt the small gust of wind and 
soft new fabric. They walked into a black and silver room. Everyone 
quickly noticed the change of clothes. (k, I&#146;m just gonna list now.)

Terri: Her dress was just like Serena&#146; s princess gown. Except no 
sleeves. It was jet black with the top half of her sign going around 
the top. It flowed from the empire waist to the bottom lined with 
silver. The bottom half of her sign there. A light periwinkle cape 
hung from her shoulders. Connecting it around her neck was an 
evergreen dragon pendent.

Serena: Her Moon gown but no sleeves. Gold crescents running along the 
top and bottom. A gold cape hung on her. A Moon stone crescent pendent 
pinning it around her neck. ( oh, all the gowns are like the moon 
gown, no sleeves.)

Ami: Hers was an icy blue. The sign of Mercury going along the top and 
bottom in silver. Her cape was a sapphire blue. A snowflake pendent 
clasping it around her neck. 

Rei: A gown of crimson red. In gold the sign of Mars ran along the top 
and bottom. To match her eyes was an amethyst cape flowed behind her. 
Hooking with a flame pendent. 

Lita: An emerald green gown with the sign of Jupiter tracing the top 
and bottom edges in silver. A light summer pink cape held with a 
lightening bolt pendent

Mina: Her gown was a topaz orange. In gold was the sign of Venus at 
the edges of the gown like the others. A light orange cape connecting 
with a heart pendent. 

Setsuna: A garnet gown, the Pluto sign in silver running along the top 
and bottom of the gown. A forest green cape linking with a key 
pendent. 

Amara: The only one not wearing a gown. A gold tuxedo with a navy blue 
shirt. No tie and the sign of Uranus around the collar. 

Michelle: Her gown was a sea-green. Silver signs of Neptune around the 
top and bottom. An ocean-blue cape clasped with a water drop pendent. 

Hotaru: A lavender gown with gold signs of Saturn. A pure white cape 
connected with an angel wing pendent. ( sorry. Longer than 
anticipated.)

&#147; There so pretty Terri! I love it!&#148; Hotaru swirled in a circle 
feeling the light fabric. 

&#147; Thanks Hotaru. You won&#146;t have to wear crowns until the coronations. 
The dresses will change every time you come. Today we match as a 
symbol of royalty.&#148;

The Senshi followed Terri as she showed them the castle. After they 
went to the gardens, where they met Darien for dinner. 

&#147; Goo-&#148;

&#147; Darien!!!&#148; Serena ran, for once gracefully, to her boyfriend.

&#147; Serena! You look gorgeous. Miss me?&#148; It seemed him and his sister 
shared a sense of humor. Serena blushed and Straightened. The others 
giggled behind them. 

Everyone sat down and chatted about what happened while they were 
separated. Darien&#146;s training would only last a month and went by 
quick. ( sorry ppl I gotta skip through a part to get this going.) 
Terri noticed how the Earth seemed colder and could tell the meteor 
was coming soon. 

Rei and Serena often visited. Terri and Rei were always in the gardens 
together. Making crowns of flowers. Taref joined them sometimes, but 
left when they were thinking of covering him in flowers. The girls 
relationship became stronger and during the month they went on many 
dates. 

Then the time for Darien to return to Earth came. He was now wiser and 
had enough knowledge to become king. The meteor was supposed to come 
on the day they returned. None of the other Senshi knew of the meteor 
that would make them sleep for 1,000 years. Only Terri and Taref, 
there for they did not go back with the others. 

As the others went through the portal back to the Mansion, Terri held 
Rei back. She pulled Rei into a tight, loving hug. Then kissed her for 
a few minutes. Terri then let go. 

&#147; Rei don&#146;t question anything that will happen. I love you and will be 
there when you wake up. Now you have to go.&#148; Terri looked sad and 
walked Rei through the portal. Coming to meet her friends Rei was 
confused. Ten minutes later the Earth was struck by a large ice 
meteor. Plunging the planet into a long hibernation, that would last 
for 1,000 years. 

Back on Terrestrial, the young Princess closed the portal quickly and 
sighed with guilt. 

&#147; It&#146;s not your problem. You couldn&#146;t tell them.&#148; Taref walked to his 
charge. 

&#147; I know Taref, I thank my mother that it&#146;s only 2 years here. Another 
1,000 years away from Rei and I would die.&#148;

And so began the 2 years Terri would wait for the Earth to thaw.</pre>
