----------

Makoto watched the red-head disappear around the corner and slowly 
released a deep breath. Turning she saw Usagi huddled into Mamoru, 
watching Setsuna curiously. Setsuna&#39;s eyes were focused on the door, her 
fists clenched, and her chest shaking. Haruka, Michiru and Hotaru were 
all watching Setsuna as well. Michiru and Hotaru looked concerned but 
Haruka almost looked angry. Makoto continued to survey the group to see 
Rei focused on the door as well, and Minako focused on Rei. With a smile 
Makoto turned to her right to see Ami staring outside as well, a look of 
sadness on her face. It took the blue-haired girl a minute, but she 
caught onto the fact that she was being watched and turned to Makoto 
with shy, ducked eyes. She flushed slightly and looked up at Makoto, a 
small smile on her face. Makoto felt the warmth flood her seeing the 
love in Ami&#39;s eyes. How could I ever have missed it? She wondered as Ami 
cleared her throat and motioned about the room slightly.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about all of this Mako-chan.&quot; Makoto quirked a grin. It was 
so like Ami to be apologetic for something she had no control over. 
Makoto stepped closer and couldn&#39;t help the grin on her face as Ami 
ducked her head at the taller girls&#39; approach. Reaching out slowly, but 
without any real hesitancy, Makoto took one of Ami&#39;s hands in hers, 
holding it softly. She heard Ami inhale quickly and knew that Ami was 
now watching her. She played with Ami&#39;s hand for a moment, running her 
fingers over her smooth skin and delicate fingers, before intertwining 
their hands and meeting Ami&#39;s eyes.

&quot;You don&#39;t have anything to be sorry about Ami-chan. I&#39;m the one who 
should apologize.&quot; She said quietly but Ami shook her head and covered 
their entwined hands with her other.

&quot;You don&#39;t have anything thing to apologize for Mako-chan.&quot; She tried to 
say but Makoto nodded firmly.

&quot;Yes, yes I do Ami-chan. I should apologize for taking so long to...&quot; 
Makoto sighed and took another breath, looking into her eyes. &quot;For not 
realizing how you felt... about me.&quot; Ami&#39;s eyes went wide and she 
flushed deeply, looking away for a moment. How did she know it was her? 
Ami wondered before shaking her head and looking back up, prepared to 
deny it. She didn&#39;t get past opening her mouth before Makoto continued 
her sentence. &quot;And for not realizing how I felt about you.&quot; She said 
quickly. Ami couldn&#39;t help the shocked look on her face as she stared up 
at Makoto in awe. How she feels about me? She thought quickly, running 
through every possible meaning of that phrase in her head so as not to 
be disappointed. Seeing Ami&#39;s confusion Makoto grinned a little and bent 
slightly. Ami&#39;s brain went into overdrive as her senses were flooded 
with Makoto&#39;s presence, and it shut down completely as Makoto very 
gently pressed their lips together. Her strength wavered and she felt 
Makoto&#39;s strong arms hold her shoulders firmly, giving her the support 
she needed. It was a chaste kiss, just enough to let them both feel the 
warmth of the other, to feel the love in their hearts, before Makoto 
pulled back, holding her breath. Ami&#39;s cheeks turned a deep fuchsia but 
she met Makoto&#39;s eyes with the same soft gaze. They both smiled tenderly 
at one another and Makoto breathed deeply. My Ami... She thought 
happily.

Minako watched the scene with a happy smile before taking a breath of 
her own and turning to Rei who was watching Makoto and Ami kiss gently 
again. She tapped Rei lightly on the shoulder and almost laughed as Rei 
whirled, apparently in shock. Seeing Minako&#39;s face she relaxed and 
sighed.

&quot;Sorry. Just a little jumpy.&quot; She explained sheepishly and Minako just 
shrugged.

&quot;It&#39;s understandable. Besides, you look kinda cute when you&#39;re 
startled.&quot; Rei&#39;s eyes opened slightly and Minako smiled playfully to let 
Rei know she was teasing her. Rei relaxed and stuck her tongue out and 
Minako smiled. She looked down at the floor for a minute, wondering 
exactly how to say what she was supposed to say. She opened her mouth 
once then closed it, sighing. Looking up at Rei she opened her mouth to 
try again, &quot;R...&quot; but shut it once more and tilted her head to the side, 
frowning at Rei slightly. &quot;Yo...&quot; &quot;I...&quot;Rei had turned to look out the 
door again but hearing a few intakes of breathe that were Minako&#39;s 
failed attempts at a conversation starter she had focused on Minako and 
was now watching the blonde, more than a little amused, and slightly 
curious and apprehensive as to what the girl was actually going to say. 
I hope she doesn&#39;t say she&#39;s in love with me. That would be awkward. 
While relaxing with Kira, Rei had considered the vampire&#39;s words 
carefully. And, while she had admitted to herself that would eventually 
fall for Minako, she knew she wasn&#39;t in love with her yet. Rei focused 
again as Minako took a very loud, very dramatic breath and looked Rei 
right in the eyes.

&quot;Rei-chan.&quot; She said carefully, and Rei braced herself internally.&quot; I 
can&#39;t... I can&#39;t give you what Makoto-chan just gave Ami-chan. I can&#39;t 
say that I&#39;m in love with you Rei-chan. I&#39;m not exactly in love with 
you.&quot; Rei smiled softly, watching Minako fidget. Obviously, Minako had 
figured out that Rei was or would be in love with her so why hide it.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Minako-chan.&quot; She said soothingly. &quot;I can&#39;t exactly say I&#39;m 
in love with you either.&quot; They both ducked their heads and looked to Ami 
and Makoto who were watching them. Ami just raised an eyebrow at Rei and 
Makoto made a face at Minako. Together, they took a deep breath and 
faced each other. Both determined to say what they really felt.

&quot;Yet.&quot; Rei said, at the exact moment Minako echoed the same word. 
Startled, they looked at each other in shock before relaxing and 
giggling softly. Confidence bolstered, Minako gently took Rei&#39;s hands in 
her own and smiled at the Priestess in all honesty.


&quot;I don&#39;t want to jump into anything Rei-chan. This idea..., it&#39;s very 
new to me and I don&#39;t want to force it. To force either of us. But, I 
know that that day will come when we&#39;re both ready. And I&#39;m willing to 
wait for that day with you, at your side. I&#39;m mean, we&#39;re peas in a bird 
right?&quot; Rei did her best to stop her tears and her laughter and smiled 
at Minako&#39;s honest face.

&quot;I think you mean birds of a feather or peas in a pod.&quot; She corrected, 
amazed that she had so easily translated, and Minako made a face.

&quot;That&#39;s what I said.&quot; She frowned lightly at Rei&#39;s laughter and sighed. 
&quot;Whatever. You know what I mean. We belong together.&quot; She said and Rei 
stopped laughing to look up into her blue eyes, a feeling of warmth and 
security coming over her at Minako&#39;s words.

&quot;Yes, yes we do.&quot; She whispered, unable to keep the giddy smile off her 
face, pleased that Minako was returning a broad grin. Emboldened, Minako 
leaned in and gently kissed Rei&#39;s cheek, surprised by its softness. She 
was more surprised by the soft kiss to her own cheek as she pulled away. 
She giggled with Rei happily once they&#39;d both pulled back, feeling 
secure and very pleased.

Setsuna was still focused on the door where&#39;d she&#39;d last seen Kira&#39;s 
form. Her peripheral hearing had picked up both mini-confessions and a 
part of her was deliriously happy for the four scouts. But the biggest 
part of her was dying inside. Seeing Kira fight so hard for them, seeing 
the tears on the vampire&#39;s face that reminded her of so long ago, it was 
all Setsuna could do to keep her knees from buckling. That she had been 
the weapon Akio had used against Kira had shocked her. Akio&#39;s words were 
still reverberating in her head. &#39;She wasn&#39;t worth the thousand years 
you spent mourning her. You gave up everything, everything for her! You 
suffered for so long and she doesn&#39;t even care! You&#39;re a demon 
Kira-chan! And a senshi will never love a demon. She will never love 
you!&#39;

A thousand years she loved me. I felt bad for Ami and Rei and they had 
to wait a hundred at the most, but a thousand? The thought was hard to 
fathom for Setsuna, and that was saying a lot given that she was the 
guardian of time. A tear slipped out of her eye and she sniffed quietly, 
squeezing her eyes shut. The vampire&#39;s face came to her unbidden and she 
almost smiled. But oh was he wrong. I couldn&#39;t love her more. She stared 
out the door again until her depressive revere was interrupted by a 
gentle yet firm smack to the back of her head. She turned in place to 
see Haruka with her arms crossed, staring at her. Michiru was standing 
just behind the tall blonde, the same apologetic look on her face as the 
last time Haruka challenged her.

&quot;What on Earth are you still doing standing here? Go get her.&quot; She 
commanded coolly and Setsuna resisted the sudden urge to hit her 
roommate with all of her force. Taking a deep breath she regarded Haruka 
with a look she knew would have melted lesser mortals and could not help 
the pleased feeling she got when even Haruka faltered.

&quot;Rules are rules Haruka-san.&quot; She explained, knowing that Haruka could 
not possibly be aware of all the ramifications. &quot;Nothing can be done 
about the situation. Leave it be.&quot; Haruka made a face and went to 
respond as Setsuna closed her eyes.

&quot;But,&quot; She started and got no further as Setsuna opened hers, allowing 
anger to flood her features, unable to stop it.

&quot;Nothing can be done!&quot; She hissed, ignoring the shocked look she got. &quot;A 
senshi can not be with a demon! ...No matter what.&quot; She pleaded with 
Haruka with her eyes. Hoping that the blonde would see the pain she was 
still trying desperately to hold in. Pleading with whatever Gods would 
listen that she would see how much this hurt. A clearing of a throat 
broke their gaze-lock and they turned to see Usagi standing beside them, 
shy determination in her eyes.

&quot;You know, &quot; She started quietly, &quot;when I first heard about all of this 
I started thinking you know? I wanted to make sure I knew all I needed 
too. The law actually was that a senshi could not be with anyone evil. 
Do you know how it came to be?&quot; She asked and Setsuna shook her head. 
For as much knowledge as she had, the origin of that had escaped her. 
Usagi closed her eyes and opened her arms as a bright, warm light 
radiated from her brooch. They all closed their eyes against it and when 
Setsuna opened hers again Queen Serenity stood before her.

&quot;Serenity!&quot; She exclaimed, dropping to a knee in tandem with all the 
others. A quiet laugh came from the white figure and she motioned them 
all to stand and gather together, Setsuna in the front. The Queen&#39;s face 
turned serious as she regarded her time senshi.

&quot;What I am about to tell you has not been known by a senshi since the 
law itself first came to pass, well before your time.&quot; She said 
seriously. She waved her hand and in front of her lights gathered to 
form into a moving picture of the solar system with one noticeable 
difference. &quot;Long ago there were ten planets in the solar system. The 
tenth planet was between Jupiter and Mars and named Caryone. It was a 
huge planet, bigger even than Jupiter.&quot; The images focused on a planet 
that was a beautiful reddish color and scanned in more to settle on an 
orange-haired senshi with colors none of them recognized. &quot;The senshi of 
Caryone at the time was Heria. She was loyal to the Kingdom, bright, and 
quite beautiful.&quot; They watched as the images swirled to show Heria in 
the arms of a tall man.&quot; She had fallen in love with a very powerful and 
secretly evil demon from Earth. There were no laws forbidding the match 
of a senshi to a demon in those times and they were soon wed. As her 
husband, he was given full power over Caryone and its people.&quot; The Queen 
swallowed hard and Setsuna watched the images twist to show the planet 
slowly turning from its red color, to a dark black.

&quot;He allowed many demons onto the planet, ruining the wonderful place 
Caryone once was. Before long, the entire planet had been overtaken with 
evil.&quot; The image pulled back to show the black filtering off into space, 
heading for other nearby planets. &quot;The evil was beginning to spread to 
the other planets, and the surrounding senshi were fearing invasion by 
the now completely corrupted planet.&quot; There was a chocked sob and 
Setsuna looked up to see a tear slip from the Queen&#39;s eye. The images 
swirled to focus on Heria. She was standing with her arms outspread, her 
aura and powers whipping about her in a blinding light. &quot;In a last, 
desperate act to stop what her husband had done and save the rest of the 
system, Heria used all of her power, her very life force, and destroyed 
the entire planet, along with all of the evil it contained.&quot; The lights 
swirled and showed large hunks of rocks swirling about in space as the 
focus pulled back even more. The Queen took a ragged breath and 
continued.

&quot;All that remained of the once beautiful, teeming planet, all that 
remains, are fragments now known as the asteroid belt.&quot; The pictures 
showed the solar system as it was today, the asteroid belt sitting 
quietly in space. &quot;Since that time, each Queen has been told what I just 
shared with you. It was the responsibility of the Queen to pass it onto 
the Princess before she took her place as the new Queen. This has been 
the only way to ensure such a tragedy would never happen again.&quot; Setsuna 
fell back onto the edge of the couch, stunned at the story and the Queen 
faded back into Usagi who leaned into Mamoru&#39;s supporting arms. 
Satisfied that she had made the right choice, Setsuna turned her head to 
look pointedly at Haruka. She, like the others, was contemplating deeply 
what the Queen had said. To sacrifice yourself, your planet... Haruka 
looked up and met Setsuna&#39;s eyes, fully prepared to be abashed for 
telling Setsuna to go after Kira when Usagi knelt before Setsuna, 
placing her hands on the older woman&#39;s knees.


&quot;I would have told you then Setsuna, if I&#39;d of known what you were going 
through. You hid it so well, just like you always do. But you see 
Setsuna-san, the law very clearly forbids a senshi from being with one 
of evil, and that law will always stand.&quot; Setsuna closed her eyes and 
tried to nod but Usagi reached and cupped her chin, forcing Setsuna to 
meet her eyes again. &quot;However, Kira is decidedly not evil. In any way, 
demon or no.&quot; Setsuna felt her jaw drop as Usagi grinned at her gently. 
She can&#39;t be saying what I think she is. She thought and Usagi patted 
her knee.

&quot;Princess?&quot; She questioned, not quite believing it. Usagi smiled softly 
at the stunned woman. &quot;Therefore...&quot; She went to say but Haruka caught 
on faster and patted Setsuna on the back.

&quot;Therefore, go get her.&quot; She said happily and Setsuna whimpered 
slightly, her eyes screwing slightly in confusion.

&quot; She kidnapped two of my senshi, but ultimately for their own good and 
did them no harm. She fought the bad guys and her brethren for us 
getting seriously wounded in the process. And she&#39;s spent the last 1000 
years loving you with all her heart. What more could we ask for as 
proof?&quot; Setsuna felt the smile on her face begin to form but swallowed 
it as best she could. It had struck her to the core to walk away from 
Kira and there wasn&#39;t a day that went by since Kira had walked back into 
her life that the image of her love&#39;s tear-stained heart-broken face did 
not haunt her. It had taken every ounce of willpower she possessed as a 
human and as the senshi of time to stay away from Kira and move on. To 
do what had to be done. She had been running from her feelings for so 
long, she couldn&#39;t believe it was okay now. She looked down at the 
ground and shook her head.

&quot;No, no. I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t go.&quot; She whimpered and her voice trembled. 
Covering her face with her hands she broke out into sobs. &quot;I can&#39;t, I 
can&#39;t.&quot; She whispered over and over again, using the mantra to 
strengthen her resolve, strengthen her will. Usagi put her hands firmly 
on the older woman&#39;s knees, rubbing reasurringly.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Setsuna-san. It&#39;s okay. You can go. Go to her, it&#39;s okay.&quot; 
But Setsuna only shook her head violently and refused to look up.

&quot;No, no I can&#39;t. I&#39;m a senshi, I&#39;m a senshi first. I have to protect 
you, I have to be there for you. I can&#39;t be with her, you have to come 
first. You have to come first.&quot; Usagi sighed and lifted her hands to 
gently grasp Setsuna&#39;s wrists, gently yet firmly pulling them down and 
away from the distraught guardian&#39;s face.

&quot;You are a senshi not to be a slave Setsuna-chan, only to protect me in 
battle. Being a senshi does not mean you cannot love another. It does 
not mean you can&#39;t love her.&quot; Setsuna looked up at her Princess and 
Usagi saw the heartbreak on her face.

&quot;But it does Princess, it does. I can&#39;t love her more than I do you. You 
have to come first. If I give up, if I let myself love her, I know it 
will be strong. I know I will love her deeply, maybe even more than I 
love you. And I&#39;m a senshi first. I have to be a senshi first. She 
cannot come before you. Don&#39;t you see?&quot; Usagi started to shake her head 
and disagree but the next move came from Haruka who knelt down beside 
Usagi. She shot Haruka a worried look but at the soft smile moved and 
let Haruka take her place.

&quot;I know what it is you&#39;re worried about Setsuna-san. You&#39;re worried that 
if you let yourself love Kira-san fully, you will love her more than you 
do Usagi. Then what happens if you are all in battle together and both 
Kira-san and the Princess are in danger? You&#39;ll run to Kira-san&#39;s aid 
and the Princess will be hurt. You can&#39;t let that happen, you&#39;re a 
senshi and it&#39;s you&#39;re duty to protect the Princess above all else. You 
can&#39;t love Kira-san because you can&#39;t let her take the place of the 
Princess in your heart. Right?&quot; Tearfully Setsuna nodded and looked at 
Haruka in confusion. Haruka only smiled and gently stroked her friend&#39;s 
hand. &quot;I know because it is the same things I felt when I first met 
Michiru. It didn&#39;t take me that long to realize how I felt about her, 
how I could feel about her if I let myself. But it wasn&#39;t long after 
that when I realized my true duty. I was born to protect the Princess. 
To put her health, her welfare above all else. I couldn&#39;t let myself 
love Michiru because that might hinder my duty to the Princess. And 
nothing could come before the Princess. That&#39;s why I ran from Michiru. 
That&#39;s why I denied us for so long.&quot; She explained, her voice slightly 
strained with emotion. Michiru put a hand on Haruka&#39;s shoulder for 
support. Setsuna nodded and looked over at Usagi, hoping she understood. 
The blonde&#39;s tear-streaked face met her eyes.

&quot;That&#39;s not fair.&quot; She whispered, almost leaning into Mamoru for 
support. &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you can&#39;t love because of me.&quot; Haruka 
smiled at her and turned back to her housemate.

&quot;That&#39;s what I thought then Setsuna-san, that&#39;s what I believed. But 
Michiru, she knew something I didn&#39;t. That&#39;s why she came after me. She 
knew that it wasn&#39;t dangerous to love each other. Know why?&quot; Setsuna and 
Usagi both shook their heads at the same time and Haruka smiled and 
pulled the blonde out of Mamoru&#39;s grasp down next to Setsuna. &quot;Listen. I 
love Michiru, I love her with all my heart. And yet I know that if the 
time for battle came and I had to choose, I know I would go to the 
Princess. I know that I would. That&#39;s why it&#39;s okay to love Michiru too, 
it won&#39;t interfere with my duties. Michiru would do the same.&quot; Michiru 
nodded but Setsuna shook her head slowly.

&quot;But how can you know that? How can you be so sure as to risk it?&quot; Now 
it was Michiru who put a hand on Setsuna&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;Because you were born a senshi Setsuna-san. Your innate desire to 
protect the Princess will never be over-shadowed. No matter how much you 
love Kira-san, or how much I love Haruka, it will never come in the way 
of your duties. You are truly devoted to the Princess and love her in a 
much different way than you ever will Kira. This goes for all of you 
too. Picture it. Picture a real true battle, don&#39;t your instincts take 
over, don&#39;t you act quicker and differently than you do in regular 
life?&quot; After a chorus of nods she continued.&quot; That&#39;s because your senshi 
self is not your regular self. Your senshi self is born, created simply 
to protect the Princess. It takes over every time you transform and will 
command the way you think, the way you act. No matter how much you love 
your significant other, you can&#39;t ever undermine that inherent devotion 
to the Princess. Ever.&quot; The aqua haired woman looked down at her stunned 
roommate as she stressed her words. Trying, as the others were, to free 
Setsuna from the shell she had encased herself to. To set her free to 
find the one thing, the one person, the she needed right now. Everyone 
was silent for a moment and then Usagi&#39;s soft voice spoke up.

&quot;I&#39;m glad that you all can love other people. It wouldn&#39;t be right if 
you couldn&#39;t. But I have to admit it. I&#39;m glad that you&#39;ll always be 
there for me if I&#39;m in trouble in a fight. I can&#39;t do it myself you 
know.&quot; Rei laughed and tousled her hair.

&quot;We know odango-atama. You can&#39;t even get to school on time by yourself. 
Did you really think we&#39;d leave you alone in a fight?&quot;

&quot;Rei-san you are so mean!&quot; Over the laughter Haruka patted Setsuna&#39;s 
knee. The woman hadn&#39;t looked up since Michiru started taking. After a 
moment the green-haired woman finally looked up and Haruka could see the 
ghost of a smile forming.

&quot;See Setsuna-san? It is okay. It is okay to go to her.&quot; Setsuna looked 
over at the smiling face of her Princess, and the supporting gaze of her 
friends. She stood as slowly and as steadily as she could. Trying to 
keep herself in check. She bowed before her confused Princess and looked 
up with tears in her eyes.

&quot;Thank you Princess.&quot; She whispered and Usagi just nodded once. The 
tears finally flowing, Setsuna started out of the room, her pace 
speeding up as she reached to door. She stopped right outside and looked 
about, franticness starting to set in. I can finally be with you Kira, 
but where did you go? She felt a tug on her arm and looked down to see 
Hotaru grinning at her. Hotaru focused for a moment, calling upon the 
dark trails Kira had left and then pointed down the street. Setsuna 
looked down the way Hotaru had pointed, trying to think of where Kira 
could have been going. Hotaru tugged on her arm again.

&quot;You should hurry up and get her Setsuna-momma.&quot; Setsuna looked at her 
daughter curiously and Hotaru almost looked sheepish. &quot;Haruka-papa said 
that another momma means more presents at Christmas.&quot; Setsuna laughed 
aloud and bent to wrap her daughter in a hug.

&quot;Thank you Hotaru-chan.&quot; She said quietly, happily, before standing and 
running the way Hotaru had pointed out. She had an idea of where Kira 
had gone and she wanted to make sure she caught her before she left. 
Letting herself run at full speed she allowed herself to recall memories 
of a thousand years ago. Before this had been downtown Tokyo, before the 
buildings and the streets. When trampled dirt would have been under her 
feet, and a huge forest before her. Seeing a giant sign loom in the 
distance she slowed and caught her breath.

&quot;Tokyo Nature Preserve and Clear Springs.&quot; She read aloud with a nervous 
smile. Before the beautiful buildings had been put up, this had been the 
sight of gorgeous waterfalls, and crystal clear pools. The first time 
she&#39;d seen it had been by moonlight. She walked through the doors and as 
she hurriedly paid her &#39;suggested&#39; fare she let the memories surface.

&quot;Kira-chan? Kira-chan where are you taking me?&quot; Setsuna asked, clinging 
to Kira&#39;s arm. They&#39;d met that night for their first official date and 
Setsuna had been more than surprised when Kira had blindfolded her and 
led her off. They had been walking for a while now, and Setsuna&#39;s 
curiosity was getting the better off her. Kira giggled lightly and 
kissed Setsuna&#39;s cheek.

&quot;It&#39;s just a bit further okay? I promise you&#39;ll like it.&quot; She said 
playfully and Setsuna tightened her grip as she nearly tripped over a 
small obstacle in the road.

&quot;For what I&#39;m putting up with here I&#39;d better love it.&quot; She demanded 
playfully and Kira laughed deeply and led her on. After a bit Setsuna 
could hear running water and as they continued the sound got louder. 
Itching with curiosity Setsuna nearly tore her blindfold off until Kira 
stopped.

&quot;All right, we&#39;re here.&quot; She whispered in Setsuna&#39;s ear, making her 
shiver slightly. &quot;You ready?&quot; Setsuna nodded and Kira removed the 
blindfold slowly. Setsuna opened her eyes and drew in a sharp breath. 
Before her was a gorgeous waterfall, only thirty or so feet high that 
came to an end in a small clear pool with a baby weeping willow tree 
hanging over its edge. In front of the pool was a blanket, several lit 
candles, and a picnic basket. Tears in her eyes she turned to Kira to 
see the girl watching her with a smile.

&quot;Kira-chan, it&#39;s beautiful.&quot; She whispered and Kira grinned broadly.

&quot;I found this place quite a few years ago. I thought it was so pretty 
and calming, I would come here to get away or grab some time to myself. 
You&#39;re the first person I&#39;ve showed this place to. Are you sure it&#39;s 
okay? If it&#39;s too cold outside we can go somewhere el...&quot; Setsuna 
silenced Kira by kissing her gently. After pulling back she leaned her 
forehead against Kira&#39;s and smiled softly.

&quot;It&#39;s perfect Kira-chan.&quot; Kira nuzzled her slightly and smiled.

&quot;Happy first date, Setsuna-chan.&quot;

Setsuna sighed as she walked through the outer gates, hearing the 
familiar sound of water. Her breath had returned to her and she walked 
slowly. There wasn&#39;t anyone else in the place, being a weekday and all. 
Reaching up she pushed a branch out of the way and turned the path 
corner, stopping in midstep. Kira stood at the edge of the pool, leaning 
up against a tree that was growing from the rocks at the bottom of the 
fall. Setsuna wasn&#39;t stupid. She had no delusions about Kira just 
running into her arms with joy at first glance. They had both gone 
through a lot and this wasn&#39;t going to be easy. Not sure what to say or 
how to breach the suddenly enormous gap that was between them, Setsuna 
faltered and tripped in a small puddle in the path. Looking up she 
watched Kira stiffen slightly at the approach. Not seeing any point to 
trying to hide that she was there, Setsuna walked slowly until she stood 
near Kira under the tree. Just as she was about to say something, Kira 
pushed off the tree and looked up into its branches.

&quot;Do you recognize this tree Setsuna-san?&quot; She asked, putting both hands 
on its trunk. &quot;This is that tiny weeping willow that was growing beside 
the falls so long ago. The one we never though could survive if it 
rained heavily?&quot; She rubbed the trunk thoughtfully and smiled. &quot;It&#39;s 
over a thousand years old now you know. It&#39;s the oldest and biggest tree 
in this area. A lot of people have carved their initials into it. See 
how the trunk is all scarred? But it&#39;s still a beautiful tree isn&#39;t it?&quot; 
She asked and Setsuna only nodded, her eyes not leaving Kira. Kira gave 
a small laugh and turned, meeting Setsuna&#39;s eyes. &quot;You and the others 
really don&#39;t have to worry about me any more. There are plenty of places 
where I can go and disappear. A thousand years is a long time to make 
connections.&quot; Setsuna still couldn&#39;t speak though her heart was 
screaming at her too. Her throat was choked up and she was trying not to 
cry. Kira had suffered for so long, a thousand years... And she loved me 
this whole time... What could she say after all of that? Taking a deep 
breath she let it out slow and tightened her fists.

&quot;Kira-ch...san, is... was what Akio-san said true? Did you really wait? 
Did you really mourn this whole time, for me?&quot; She asked. She had to 
know, she had to hear Kira say it. Kira looked at her sadly and turned 
back to the waterfall, wrapping her arms protectively around herself and 
hugging herself lightly.

&quot;Yeah, that&#39;s true. You were special Setsuna-san. I couldn&#39;t forget you, 
no matter how hard I tried. No matter how much I wanted to.&quot; The vampire 
shrugged a little. &quot;Don&#39;t worry though. I don&#39;t hold you responsible 
like Akio did. Remembering you...that was my choice more or less.&quot; 
Setsuna couldn&#39;t help the tears and she covered her mouth with a hand.

&quot;It still wasn&#39;t supposed to be like that. I left so no body would get 
hurt. It wasn&#39;t supposed to be worse. I&#39;m sorry Kira-san, I&#39;m so sorry 
for that, for all of this. I...&quot; She choked slightly and Kira turned 
back to her, tears in her eyes as well.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Setsuna-san. Remembering you was a good thing. Rei-chan 
figured it all out. Remembering you kept me good Setsuna-san, it kept me 
right.&quot; Setsuna almost bent at the knees, the tears flowing down her 
face as she watched the tears in Kira&#39;s eyes well-up.&quot; It was hard 
Setsuna-san. I missed you. I missed you... so much.&quot; Kira was crying 
just as hard as Setsuna and raised her arm, ready to wipe away Setsuna&#39;s 
tears. She stopped mid-way through and dropped her arm to her side, 
trying to stop her own tears. Kira turned on her heel, ready to leave 
and Setsuna stepped forward, suddenly finding the courage to say what 
she needed to. She&#39;d hid from her feelings for so long, denied what she 
felt but...

&quot;I missed you too, Kira-chan.&quot; She said and Kira spun sharply, looking 
at Setsuna with wide eyes. Feeling the need to spill everything Setsuna 
began talking rapid-fire, needing to get it all out. &quot;I didn&#39;t want to 
leave Kira-chan, I didn&#39;t want to leave you. I fought with myself for 
months before. I tried to think of anything else I could do, of any 
other way. All I could decide on was that my duty to the Princess had to 
come first Kira-chan, it had too.&quot; Looking down she shook her head 
slightly. &quot;I was always amazed at how Michiru-san and Haruka-san could 
do it, even back then. How they could allow themselves to love each 
other, but still put protecting the Princess first, put it above 
protecting each other.&quot; She looked up sharply.

&quot;And even once Ami-chan and Makoto-chan and Rei-chan and Minako-chan 
were supposed to get together. They always managed to balance duty and 
love. I never understood that. I never thought I could. I didn&#39;t think 
that I was strong enough to do that. That&#39;s why I stayed away from love. 
That&#39;s why I swore that I would never fall in love. That even if I was 
to be with someone I would never let my feelings for them become 
stronger than my dedication to my duty. My dedication to my Princess.&quot; 
Taking a soothing breath she looked into Kira&#39;s eyes and saw the 
uncertainty in the vampire&#39;s gaze. Setsuna sighed and took another deep 
breath.

&quot;But with you Kira-chan, I failed with you. Despite all of my efforts 
and wishes, I fell in love with you.&quot; Kira started to cry again, silent 
tears running down her cheeks as Setsuna continued. &quot;Fighting with 
myself between the two tore me apart Kira-chan. It hurt so much, I was 
devastated. But, I had to leave Kira-chan. I had to be a senshi first no 
matter how much it killed me to say goodbye to you. I&#39;ll always have to 
be a senshi first.&quot; Setsuna was speaking calmly and through her tears 
Kira regarded her curiously. Setsuna had a small, almost childish smile 
on her face. She suddenly looked very shy and uncertain, but determined.

&quot;But, I mean... if someone didn&#39;t mind that...&quot; She trailed off and Kira 
allowed the surprise on her face.

&quot;Don&#39;t toy with me like that Setsuna-chan. Last I checked that law was 
still in place. If it&#39;s gonna be the Princess first, then isn&#39;t this a 
big no-no?&quot; She questioned and Setsuna dug a toe into the ground before 
looking back at Kira.

&quot;Do you know why the law is in place Kira-chan?&quot; She asked after a 
moment and Kira sighed heavily, wiping away her tears and leaning up 
against the tree again.

&quot;Actually I do. Many demons in the underworld were proud of what he had 
done. I know the story particularly well because, the demon who 
destroyed that planet... sired the vampire that sired me.&quot; Reeling 
slightly Setsuna regarded Kira&#39;s downcast face and shook it off.

&quot;Then you know the law is there to protect the senshi from evil.&quot; Kira 
nodded and sighed.

&quot;Yep.&quot; Setsuna smiled slightly.

&quot;You&#39;re not evil Kira-chan.&quot; She said slowly and Kira looked up into her 
eyes. Setsuna looked hopeful now, happy. Is she really saying... Not 
fully believing what she was hearing Kira thought quickly.

&quot;Your Princess can&#39;t be too happy that I kidnapped two of her senshi.&quot; 
Setsuna stepped closer, sensing Kira&#39;s uncertainty, and shrugged 
lightly.

&quot;It helped them both in the end actually. And you did release them both. 
As well as sustain terrible injury fighting a battle for us.&quot; She added 
and Kira just stared at her, a hopeful feeling creeping into being. She 
shook her head a little and stared at Setsuna.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t evil back then either Setsuna-chan. Are you telling me that 
fighting Akio for the sake of good was all it took for your Princess to 
accept me?&quot; Setsuna looked up at the sky then back at Kira.

&quot;I think that that combined with that fact that you stayed good for so 
long, was plenty to convince her. 1000 years is a long time to stay good 
Kira-san. A long time. Please Kira-chan, I don&#39;t want to let you go.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t get it Setsuna-san. I don&#39;t get you. You say you ran from me 
because you had to be a senshi first. Has that changed now?&quot;

&quot;No, no it hasn&#39;t. I was born a senshi Kira-chan, I will always be that 
first.&quot;

&quot;Then how can you be here, telling me how you felt? How you feel.&quot;

&quot;Because I&#39;m stronger now Kira-chan. I&#39;m strong enough to love the 
Princess, and to love you. I can make this work now Kira-chan.&quot;

&quot;And what? You just couldn&#39;t then?&quot; Kira demanded, getting a little 
agitated. &quot;Why was it so easy for you to walk away before and yet you 
can&#39;t let me go now?&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy for me before. I hated losing you.&quot; Setsuna defended. &quot;I 
just had to...&quot;

&quot;Yeah, I know. You had to be a senshi first. But you&#39;re still a senshi 
first now right? You&#39;re just suddenly strong enough now? You suddenly 
care enough to make it work? What? You didn&#39;t care back then? Did you 
even think of me Setsuna-chan? Did I even cross your mind at all in the 
past 1000 years?&quot; Kira demanded angrily. Setsuna straightened and 
frowned.

&quot;Actually I was at my post for most of that time. I had to keep watch 
over the streams of time until all of the senshi had been reborn. I 
wasn&#39;t even Setsuna again until recently.&quot;

&quot;But you didn&#39;t look me up? Losing me tore you up inside, but you never 
thought to see how I was doing?&quot; Kira said sarcastically and Setsuna got 
frustrated, raising her voice.

&quot;I had to move on Kira-chan. I had decided to be a senshi. Thinking 
about or seeing you would have made it worse. I had to give up on you to 
be true to my duties, and that&#39;s exactly what I did!&quot;

&quot;You forgot about me. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m so blasted memorable!&quot; Kira hissed 
and Setsuna almost growled.

&quot;Of course I forgot about you, I had to. I did my absolute best not to 
think about you at all!&quot;

&quot;Oh? And why is that? Afraid I&#39;d mess up your perfect senshi life?!&quot;

&quot;I didn&#39;t think about you because if I had even let myself see your face 
for an instant I would have abandoned my duties and run back to you!&quot; 
Setsuna yelled, sobbing. Kira stopped and looked and her with a pained 
gaze. Setsuna kept crying and fell down on her knees, the whirlwind of 
emotion to much for her. &quot;I almost didn&#39;t leave you Kira-chan.&quot; She 
whimpered. &quot;It scares me to this day how close I was from walking away 
from it all. Abandoning the Princess to be with you. I was so close to 
just leaving everything and everyone behind.&quot; Setsuna took a haggard 
breath. &quot;But at the last second I heard her talking to her mother. I 
heard the Princess telling Serenity how glad she was that she had her 
guardians at her side. How safe she felt because of our loyalty, because 
of our strength. Then I realized I couldn&#39;t leave her Kira-chan. She 
needed me. And I needed her. I may have been happy for a while, but my 
place is defending her, protecting her. Walking away from you hurt me 
more than anything else I have ever seen or done. It ripped me apart 
Kira-chan. But that&#39;s why I couldn&#39;t think about you. That&#39;s why I 
couldn&#39;t see you. I knew that I felt so strongly for you that it would 
over-power my sense of duty. And I couldn&#39;t let that happen.&quot; Setsuna 
looked up at Kira with a tear-stained face, shivering from her sobs. She 
pleaded that Kira understand, see what she meant as the vampire sank to 
her knees as well.

&quot;Don&#39;t you see Kira-chan? I loved you so much I thought that you would 
be able to pull me away from the Princess. I thought that I would betray 
everything I was born for just to be with you. That&#39;s why I ran. The 
law, the law gave me something to blame. Something to focus on instead 
of acknowledging the real reason I left. Because I loved you. Because I 
love you now Kira-chan. I can never be sorry enough for leaving you, 
even though I had to do it. But I swear to you that will never happen 
again. I won&#39;t ever leave you Kira-chan. Never again.&quot; With that Setsuna 
just sat back on her knees, sniffing and trying to bring herself back 
under control. She felt absolutely raw and she had opened herself up 
more today that she had ever before. She was aching all over and she 
couldn&#39;t stop shivering. With nothing left to say, all she could do was 
wait for Kira&#39;s next move. Kira was sniffing slightly but was otherwise 
quiet making Setsuna shift uncomfortably. After a bit she stood and 
Setsuna followed suit, not looking up and doing her best not to rock 
from foot to foot.

&quot;And everyone is really okay with you just coming out here like this? I 
mean, last I checked the tall blonde, her girlfriend and their kid all 
hated me.&quot; Setsuna considered her words carefully before speaking.

&quot;I think it will take a while before they welcome you with open arms. 
But they&#39;ve all been through a lot. They know you were just trying to 
freak everyone out. And as for Hotaru...well, she has a past that was 
much worse than your threat.&quot; Kira stopped rubbing the back of her fists 
in her almost dry eyes and raised an eyebrow at that.

&quot;You senshi lead interesting lives.&quot;

&quot;We try.&quot; Setsuna said softly. &quot;You&#39;ll get used to it.&quot; She added, 
trying to get a hint as to where Kira stood.

&quot;Will I now?&quot; The vampire asked, her voice still not giving anything 
away. Setsuna didn&#39;t look up as she answered.

&quot;If I have anything to say about it you will.&quot; She said, being as 
obvious as she could. After a moment of silence Kira responded.

&quot;I just want to be clear about what you&#39;re saying.&quot; Kira said slowly and 
Setsuna almost sighed in exasperation, cocking her head and looking up 
to see the hopeful, teasing smile on Kira&#39;s face. She regarded the 
vampire with a playful grin and rubbed at her redder than usual eyes.

&quot;You aren&#39;t going to make this easy on me are you?&quot; She sniffed and Kira 
looked at her, staring at her with her heart in her eyes.

&quot;If you&#39;re saying what I think you are, then I&#39;ve been waiting over a 
thousand years to hear it.&quot; She said softly, holding her breath. Setsuna 
smiled gently, her face turning more serious. She stepped closer to Kira 
and gazed at the woman who could still make her palms sweaty, still make 
her chained heart beat. Making sure Kira had met her eyes Setsuna 
breathed deeply.

&quot;I love you Kira-chan. And, if you don&#39;t mind being second only to the 
Princess, and if you&#39;re willing to forgive a thousand years of 
stupidity...&quot; She trailed off and Kira couldn&#39;t help the huge smile on 
her face. Choking a little she looked down and then back up at her love, 
disbelief almost banished from her face.

&quot;Setsuna-chan...&quot; She whispered and was interrupted as Setsuna jumped at 
her and Kira found herself wrapped in the time senshi&#39;s embrace. 
Brimming with happiness Kira returned the gesture and buried her head in 
Setsuna&#39;s neck, breathing in her scent deeply, remembering the feel of 
being in her arms. The warmth of her up close. All past ills forgotten 
Kira pulled back just enough to meet eyes with Setsuna one last time 
before moving forward and kissing her deeply. A thousand years of desire 
and want coming forward at once, Setsuna fought not to be overwhelmed 
and returned the kiss with just as much enthusiasm and passion. The heat 
of the vampire&#39;s kiss made her weak in the knees and forced her to tear 
up once again, but for the first time in a long time it was with 
absolute happiness.

Just down the path a ways Hotaru giggled and leaned up against Haruka, 
whispering that now Christmas was going to be awesome. Haruka smiled at 
her daughter&#39;s words and held Michiru close. Watching the beautiful 
scene in front of them made her feel all snugly. They had all waited a 
few minutes after Setsuna had left before curiosity had gotten the 
better of their Princess and they had trooped out the door. After taking 
only one wrong turn they had all reached the pair about the time that 
Kira and Setsuna were standing up. The tear stains on both faces had 
given them all reason to worry but a few minutes of silent watching had 
paid off.

A small tug and Haruka tore her gaze down to her lover who gestured over 
her shoulder. Everyone was there, watching Kira and Setsuna hold each 
other. Usagi snuggled into Mamoru and he leaned down and kissed the top 
of her head lovingly. Minako and Rei were standing next to one another, 
both blushing lightly as their hands entwined. Ami was leaning up 
against Makoto and she titled to her head back to regard the lightening 
senshi with a smile. Makoto bent slightly and placed a soft kiss on the 
tip of her nose and Ami grinned happily.

Haruka smiled broadly at her own love who had been watching them as well 
and then turned back to the newest lovebirds only to find them staring 
at the group. Hand in hand they walked back down the path and Usagi 
rubbed the back of her neck sheepishly.

&quot;Hotaru-chan told us where you&#39;d run off too. We just wanted to see if 
everything was okay. How did you know we were here?&quot; She asked curiously 
and Setsuna turned to Kira who smiled.

&quot;Vampires have excellent hearing.&quot; She said and Usagi sweat dropped a 
bit. Seeing that Haruka was feeling maybe a bit too at ease and wanting 
to needle her for earlier, Setsuna grinned playfully and nudged Kira&#39;s 
shoulder lightly.

&quot;If your hearing is really that good, you should be sure to wear really 
good ear-plugs on weekend nights.&quot; She said. Kira raised an eyebrow and 
Setsuna leaned in conspiratorially to whisper, loudly enough for 
everyone to hear. &quot;That&#39;s when Haruka-chan and Michiru-chan have their 
&#39;alone time&#39; together.&quot; The snickers started first as both Haruka and 
Michiru turned beet red. Then Kira couldn&#39;t hold it in anymore and broke 
out laughing as the rest of the group followed suit. Their happy sounds 
drifting up through the willow branches.
