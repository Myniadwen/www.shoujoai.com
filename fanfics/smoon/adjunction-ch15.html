<p><em>Eika laughed. With a wink, Eika  replied, “Tips on how to woo a princess. Hino-chan, you've never  confessed to a girl before, right?”</em></p>
<p><em>In that moment, Rei made a very  good imitation of a statue.</em></p>
<p><em>Well, more like a person petrified  by aliens while trying to run in fear, but that's beside the point.</em></p>
<p><em>Rei gulped.</em></p>
<p>Rinka sighed. <em>She's stunned yet another victim.</em> “Eika-”</p>
<p>Eika looked over  and mouthed, 'I know, sorry.' To Rei, who was still trying to  stutter out an obvious question, she replied, “I've been doing this  a long time, Hino-chan. Forced gender recognition is one of the  easiest tricks in my book.”</p>
<p>Rei stared in awe.</p>
<p>Eika laughed,  twirling halfway around so as to go refill her coffee mug from the  edge of a desk beside the back door. She remained in view, despite  not looking Rei in the eye. “Of course, your reaction just now  gave your secret away. Even if I hadn't already known and had been  merely taking a wild guess just now, I would have learned it right  there and then.”</p>
<p>Rei fumbled and  fell back onto her stool with a soft thud. She inwardly cursed  herself for having been tricked so easily.</p>
<p>Rinka only shook  her head hopelessly. “I think now would be a fine time to remind  you two that it is nearing 1:30? Hino-san, I do hope you didn't have  any appointments to keep...”</p>
<p>Rei blinked out of  her daze to check her watch, and thus affirmed that Rinka was right.  “I-I don't have any meetings for a few hours, but I should get  going...”</p>
<p>The fire priestess  took hold of her shopping bags and was about to make some sort of  departing remark when Eika returned, coffee mug filled. “Wait a  minute, Hino-chan.”</p>
<p>It just occurred  to Rei at that moment what Eika, a stranger, was referring to her as,  but considering she had just spilled more of her beans, milk, and  cats-out-of-bags than she had ever before, she let the nickname  slide. For now.</p>
<p>Eika walked up to  her, brandishing a business card between two of her fingers. With  another toothsome smile, she stated in her low, naturally soothing  tone, “Take this. I've taken a particular interest in your case,  Hino-chan. Therefore, just for you, I'll leave my cell number open  so you can update me on all the latest happenings with your love  interest this week, so we can work all the closer towards your happy  ending of sorts. This also has the store's website address on it in  case you want to look through our online jewelry catalog in the mean  time.”</p>
<p>“Ah...” <em>I  don't have a computer though... oh wells. Maybe I'll ask Ami if I  can borrow hers for a little bit sometime... </em>“Thanks. Sorry  for the trouble. Um..” <em>Shoot, what was her name again? I'm  usually pretty decent at remembering names too...</em></p>
<p>Eika smiled yet  again and righted the card so that Rei could read it without holding  it. “Kisekino Eika. Owner of this branch of Kiseki Jewels.  Hmm... your hands are pretty full, aren't they? No, no, don't put  them down. I like to hope that my special business cards get treated  with enough respect that the numbers are legible after the fact, so I  think I'll... ah, don't move now, all right?”</p>
<p>Before Rei could  object, though Eika had already placed some sort of petrifying spell  on her, the jeweler took the card and slipped it neatly into the lacy  bra cup that was just barely peeking out from behind the  semi-unbuttoned blouse. Assured that no simple passer-byer would be  able to see it, Eika tapped it lightly with her knuckles before  leaning back. Before doing so, however, she whispered, “There.  Now take good care of it, won't you? I won't forgive Hino-chan if I  find that an old geezer is calling my private line.”</p>
<p>The blush came  slowly, like how a horror film heroine painstakingly turns around to  face the monster, but come it did. Full force. It went over the  meter of endurance when Rei realized that she couldn't muster the  indignation she usually would have in this sort of situation.</p>
<p>Then again, if she  thought about it, <em>usually</em>...</p>
<p>No one would have  ever gotten that close to her.</p>
<p>No one would have <em>tried</em> to get that close to her.</p>
<p>Much less for  taking a business card...</p>
<p>And leaving it <em>there</em>.</p>
<p>Rei could  definitely feel it.</p>
<p>It was cold to the  touch, and yet, it wasn't freezing in the least.</p>
<p>Eika continued to  smile at her. Almost innocently. Almost.</p>
<p>Something like a  cat who had just mutilated a rat and was waiting for you to comment  on the carcass.</p>
<p>Maybe innocent  wasn't quite the right word.</p>
<p>“Hino-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei snapped out of  her daze. “A-ahm. I'll... I'll be going now. Th-thank you for  your time, um, Kisekino-san.”</p>
<p>Eika laughed  pleasantly, holding a hand up to wave. “I'll be waiting. Though I  hope you're aware, people who call me on my cell are generally on  good enough terms with me to call me by my first name.”</p>
<p>Rei was still very  much flushed, and this did not help matters. So she simply bowed her  head and turned to walk out.</p>
<p>Eika waited until  the bell had tinkled to signal the younger woman's departure before  sitting on the edge of Rei's stool, still somewhat warm.</p>
<p>She sipped her  coffee with a soft purr of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Rinka's voice  interrupted her musings. “Eika... are you <em>sure </em>your hobby  isn't to break up couples as opposed to keeping them or bringing them  together?”</p>
<p>Eika laughed  softly, and took another sip without answering.</p>
<p>Rinka, dubious  now, voiced, “Eika-chan?”</p>
<p>Eika had been  watching the slightly swaying priestess head into the nearby train  station. Only when her target was out of sight did she respond, “Of  course I'm sure. That it's the latter. But can't I remind you that  this is a no-profit hobby? I'm entitled to my fun.”</p>
<p>Rinka sighed.  “But why do you have to have fun with store customers?”</p>
<p>A longer sip of  coffee was had. “What does it matter? All the clients in the past  have come back for more, haven't they?”</p>
<p>Rinka fought back  another sigh as she went to the computer in the back room to check  the site orders. <em>Sure, but they all end up coming back for you,  not the jewelry.</em></p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>“Minako? ...  Oi, Minako!”</p>
<p>The idol blinked  out of her daze and looked around. She realized she was driving just  in time to avoid a head on collision, returning to the proper lane  while ignoring the angry honking in her direction. <em>Angry honking  is a good sign that I'm not recognized, but I guess I really  shouldn't be spacing out while at the wheel.</em></p>
<p>Artemis sighed.  “What are you thinking about?”</p>
<p>Minako smiled.  “Sorry, Artemis. Nothing in particular. Today's schedule might  have worn me out more than I realized, no matter how used to it I  am.”</p>
<p>Artemis  looked up at his charge and shook his head. “I know you,  Minako. That isn't a 'nothing' thought that's distracting you.”</p>
<p>The smile waned a little, but it still  remained as Minako continued the drive. “Maybe it was. But it's  nothing now, considering I've forgotten it.”</p>
<p>The white fluff of animated plush  looked ahead from the passenger seat, though that meant nothing from  his position. He knew she was lying again, like she had been  increasingly more often ever since she had left Japan after the  wedding. But there was only one thing she lied about. Before, she  only lied about how affected she was by the illness, at least where  Artemis was concerned. Now, she only lied, again concerning her  feelings, about how affected she was by a certain priestess. Artemis  only hoped it didn't have the same result. No, he didn't just hope  for it; he <em>pleaded</em> for it.  He didn't want Minako <em>or </em>Rei  to have to go through all those high strung emotions again. No  matter what this resolution would be. Well, <em>almost</em> no matter. Some other exceptions were only natural to be prayed for  as well.</p>
<p>The car rolled to  a stop right where Artemis expected. On the back street near the  shrine. Rei's shrine.</p>
<p>Minako held out  her hand. “Are you coming?”</p>
<p>Not wanting to be  left behind after spending the weekend at the Tsukino's, Artemis  hurriedly jumped up into his charge's waiting arms.</p>
<p>Car locked behind  them, Minako made her way up the steps, dyed in the red light of the  setting sun.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>As  soon as she arrived home, she rushed to unpack her new supplies, and  refill her kit. In face of the impending horrible stain (or  something to that effect) Rei worked doggedly to remove it,  forgetting in the meantime, to put the business card in a less  suggestive place. The only reason she hadn't removed it right there  on the train was... well... people might have gotten the wrong idea,  if they'd seen her.</p>
<p>That said, she was comfortably propped  against the wall, gently wiping the fingerprints off of her limited  (first) edition postcards when she heard her name being called.</p>
<p>The second time she heard the voice,  she recognized it. <em>Minako?</em></p>
<p>Rei hurried to  clean up what she had taken out, pushing her collection back into  place in the closet. She had only just finished sliding the door  closed when Minako poked her head through Rei's open bedroom doorway.   She knocked conspicuously on the doorframe.</p>
<p>“Am I disturbing  you?”</p>
<p>Rei shook her  head. “No, not at all. Come in; I was just cleaning up some more.</p>
<p>Artemis came into  view as Minako took Rei up on her invitation. “Osu! Long time no  see, Rei-san!”</p>
<p>Rei nodded to the  white furball, making note to assure that her own plushie did not  reveal itself under any circumstances. “Tea?”</p>
<p>“Sure,” Minako  answered, having seated herself by the coffee table. As Rei busied  herself with the tea, Minako started, “Ah, I have your pass. Wanna  see?”</p>
<p>“In a sec,”  Rei mumbled. Having Minako so close again reminded her far too much  of her afternoon, from the first train ride to the business card, the  latter of which made itself particularly noticeable now, at least to  her.</p>
<p>Watching the  priestess, Minako couldn't help but wonder if something was wrong.  She seemed... more on edge... at least... more than she had been the  last few days. “What's wrong?”</p>
<p>“What do you  mean? Nothing's wrong.” Rei knew she couldn't even fool herself  with that one, so she tried to change gears. “How was your day?”</p>
<p>Minako paused for  the slightest of moments, before smiling and letting herself relax,  nearly squishing Artemis as she leaned her arms flat on the table.  Artemis having escaped safely, she rested her head in the crook of  her arm, turning to look at the priestess' back. “Tiring. But no  more so than usual. I'm glad I get off early for good behavior.”</p>
<p>“Good behavior?  What are you, in prison?”</p>
<p>Minako laughed,  realizing how that had sounded. She mumbled a thanks as Rei came to  the table with the tea, sitting across from her. “Speaking of  which, besides breakfast here, I think I missed on having any other  food with substance today. Just some water and snacks from the  vending machine...” She smiled apologetically at the disapproving  glare Rei sent her. She more than anyone had scolded the idol about  proper eating habits the past several years (over the phone).</p>
<p>“Minako...”</p>
<p>The idol cut her  off with a grin. “That's why I was wondering if you would have  dinner with me.”</p>
<p>Rei blinked,  honestly surprised. Artemis seemed to feel much the same,  considering his mistress' forwardness.</p>
<p><em>If that is what  must be done, then you know what you must do.</em></p>
<p>Minako  was already continuing, “You don't have to, of course. I'm sure I  can manage well enough on my own if I go back to my suite, and I'm  sure I've imposed too much on you alrea-”</p>
<p>“Sure.” Rei  smiled a little, even more at Minako's return surprised expression.  “I don't have any food here though. Usagi somehow used it all and  I didn't think to buy more until after I... erm... came back from  buying... hygienic supplies.” <em>For my collection,</em> Rei didn't  add.</p>
<p>“Hmm... should  we go out?”</p>
<p>Rei held back her  flinch, which was already a form of holding back her reaction to  Minako's choice of words.</p>
<p>She could feel her  heart speeding up.</p>
<p>She took a sip  from her cup, neutrally neither very bitter nor very sweet this time.</p>
<p>“Y-you sure you  want to risk that? In public...”</p>
<p>Minako nodded  thoughtfully. “I suppose you're right... There are some places I  know that would make special accommodations but... not out of the  blue like this. The hotel suite then?”</p>
<p>Her heart seemed  to believe that this new heartbeat rate was what the norm was, and  remained like so.</p>
<p>Which made it hard  for Rei to form coherent responses. Maybe spilling everything hadn't  been such a great idea after all. Now... now that she knew how she  personally felt... almost every nook and cranny of it...</p>
<p>Getting  embarrassed at everything... the slightest suggestion... was more  than just the reality of it all.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan? You  sure you're all right?”</p>
<p>Rei nodded, taking  another hurried sip. “I... I don't mind, I guess. You want to  leave now?”</p>
<p>Minako paused,  watching her another moment, before shrugging in answer. “If you  like.”</p>
<p>There was a  silence.</p>
<p>They drank their  tea.</p>
<p>“OH!” It  suddenly occurred to Minako that she should present the pass to her  now, before she forgot. Fishing it out of her purse, she proudly  handed it over. “Your pass.”</p>
<p>A bit curious,  especially remembering how Minako said she would make it foolproof,  Rei set down her cup and reached over to take it.</p>
<p>She inwardly  shuddered as their fingers grazed each other, but she fought it back.</p>
<p>Then she got a  good look at the photo that had been laminated along with her name  and some sort of numerical code.</p>
<p>“M-Min...  This... Min-ako... you...” Eventually, she gave up all pretenses  towards politeness and slapped it (somewhat gently) on the table  between them. “What the heck is this!”</p>
<p>The picture, Rei  remembered all too well, had been from one of her and Minako's few  private outings in their younger years. It was not only outdated and  with a silly border but...</p>
<p>Minako grinned  innocently, “What's wrong? I think it's a cute picture of you.  (n.n)”</p>
<p>Cheeks flaming  red, Rei tapped the picture repeatedly, incidentally touching the  little cupids that had served as the border, considering it was a  dateless Valentines Day outing.</p>
<p>“You can't be  serious! Why on Earth would I <em>ever</em> show this to anyone, much  less for identification! I thought we agreed to throw this one  out!”</p>
<p>Minako continued  to grin. “Knowing how to work the machine is a great trick,  Rei-chan. I'll teach you sometime. I have a whole sheet still of  this picture.”</p>
<p>Rei stared at her  agape. “Throw it out! Throw it out!”</p>
<p>Minako only  grinned and stood up, walking around the table as Rei stared  unseeing.</p>
<p>Which was why Rei  was beyond startled when she felt the presence behind her, and two  fingers entering her mouth from either side...</p>
<p>Followed by a  slightly painful jerk of both fingers hooking her mouth into a forced  open smile.</p>
<p>... Emphasis on  the word “forced”.</p>
<p>Minako grinned as  Rei tried in vain to protest, “Artemis, look, doesn't she look <em>exactly </em>like the photo?”</p>
<p>Artemis had hopped  onto the table, comparing the photo on the pass to the real-live  edition. He nodded seriously, having been pampered into alliance  earlier in the day. “Yes, it's a perfect match. And I'm sure no  other would even consider posing like that to get backstage with your  pass.”</p>
<p>Rei finally  managed to break free as Minako purposely loosened her hold. “I  wasn't posing! And not even <em>I</em> would consider doing that to  get backstage! Mi-na-ko!”</p>
<p>And so, girl  chasing and face deforming commenced.</p>
<p>On the bright  side, Rei was able to forget her nervousness for those precious few  minutes.</p>
<p>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>
<p>Half an hour  later, clothes changed and pass reluctantly accepted, Minako and Rei  were on their way to the hotel.</p>
<p>Rei ruefully  rubbed her cheeks, which she imagined were still sore.</p>
<p>Minako glanced at  her, hiding amusement. “It wouldn't have happened in the first  place if you had smiled properly from the start, you know.”</p>
<p>Rei glared at her.   “Well excuse me if I don't have years of photo shooting experience  to back me up in little photo booths.”</p>
<p>Minako smiled,  taking it in stride. “It's not like you don't know <em>how</em> to  smile... you just... hmm... come to think of it... when you were  taking those shots as Mars Reiko, you didn't smile either, did you?”</p>
<p>Rei fidgeted.  “What's your point?”</p>
<p>The idol shook her  head. “Nothing, I was just thinking at random.”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Rei fingered the  pass that hung around her neck. While changing, she had decided to,  on the spur of the moment, stick Eika's card between the extra sheets  behind the picture. She didn't want to risk someone somehow finding  it in her wallet, or purse, or her room... it seemed like the safest  place, considering Rei would be heavily guarding this pass lest any  other see it besides Minako's guard personnel. In other words,  anyone besides those who <em>had</em> to see it.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate  that Rei could no longer use her backstage pass for bragging. She  would die if any of those little brats saw <em>that </em>picture.</p>
<p>No, scratch that.</p>
<p>She would have no  more apprentices because she would have to kill them after the fact.</p>
<p>And she needed her  apprentices. For the future at least. And menial labor.</p>
<p>Rei sat in wait as  Minako coasted into the parking garage, slipping up the levels to a  spot seemingly left open just for her.</p>
<p>Minako grinned at  her once they had stopped, as if parking was some miracle reminder  for her memory of Rei being forced to smile.</p>
<p>Rei ignored her  and got out of the car.</p>
<p>They walked side  by side to the elevator, which was empty aside from them. Artemis  was resting quietly in Minako's arms as the elevator doors slid open  to reveal the top floor, the roof (glass) dome restaurant.</p>
<p>Not far after she  had stepped out, Rei stopped dead in her tracks.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it  would make more sense if all coherent thought stopped, and prevented  her from going against the already set command to “walk forward”.</p>
<p>Incidentally,  Minako caught sight of someone she knew, and head right towards the  object of Rei's petrification trick.</p>
<p>The target of her  stare looked up as Minako called out to the target's companion. Both  stood up with smiles.</p>
<p>“Minako-chan!  Rei-chan! What a surprise! You decided to have dinner here after  all?”</p>
<p>Minako nodded to  her manager, smiling with the innocence that her fans adored. She  turned to her eccentric manager's companion and tilted her head. “I  don't believe we've met. You are...?”</p>
<p>The woman had been  watching Rei's frozen expression with amusement, but at the address  turned her attention to the idol. She bowed her head with a soft  smile.</p>
<p>“Kisekino Eika,  at your service, Aino-san. I'm sorry to have not met your  acquaintance before, but it's a pleasure to do so now. You see, your  manager here is actually my uncle, Saitou Sugao.”</p>
<p>Rei stared. <em>You  can't be serious.</em></p>
