<h1>I'll Protect You (part 13 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/runestine.html">rune stine</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/illprotectu-ch12.html">Back to Part 12</a><pre>After Minako&#39;s rehearsal they went back to the hotel that night. They 
had met up with Minako&#39;s make-up artists and fashion designer. They 
talked all night at Minako&#39;s hotel room and discussed about the look and 
attire that Minako is going to wear

&quot;I have brought thirty eight pairs of dress and foot wears here. All 
came from the clothes designers of London. They said that those newly 
made attires are Asian inspired, and will surely fit for your concert 
this Saturday&quot; Minako&#39;s fashion designer said

Minako is looking at the cabinet bag filled with clothes with excitement

&quot;They&#39;re all beautiful! How did you manage to bring all of these here?&quot; 
Asked the pop star

&quot;Geez, do you know that we have to pay additional Euros for those?&quot; 
Replied the fashion designer

&quot;If your concert is two and a half hours long, then you should have 
fifteen kinds of make-up combinations per hour&quot; Said one of Minako&#39;s 
beauticians as she writes down the possible color combinations fit for 
the clothes and for Minako&#39;s face

&quot;Yeah, Aino&#39;s concert were a bit longer here because it&#39;s a homecoming 
concert&quot; Added Wendy

Rei was looking at the talking group silently a little far away from 
them. She was relieved that they came because that will make Minako busy 
enough to notice her. She takes out the paper she was reading that 
morning

&quot;Let&#39;s start from the first four lines...&quot; Rei mumbled

If you can read this ten times and clear

And realize you are who we seek

Better hush, stay beside your dear

Else you&#39;ll never see her again even a single peek

&quot;Well that was pretty obvious that this letter is intending to kill 
someone...okay next four lines&quot;

We seek no revenge nor start chaos purposely

Blame us not; you can seize this and spare one dear

If you seek answers recklessly

Her voice will be forgotten and death will be unclear

&quot;If you seek answers recklessly...Geez, the concert&#39;s at Saturday! One 
day from now...what do they think of me? Batman who can easily solve the 
riddler&#39;s riddles?&quot; Rei hissed then she continued

&quot;Her voice will be forgotten and unclear...Her voice...her voice...&quot;

&quot;Who&#39;s voice?&quot; Minako said at her back

&quot;Eeek, Mina-chan!&quot; Said Rei as she jumped

&quot;Rei-chan what are you doing mumbling at a paper like that?&quot;

&quot;Er...I was just trying to entertain myself by writing a poem&quot; Rei lied

&quot;Really? I don&#39;t know you write poems, LeMeSee, LeMeSeeee!&quot; Minako tried 
to grab the paper but Rei moved it out of her reach

&quot;Unfair! There&#39;s nothing to be ashamed of when people wants to read your 
work!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not that. You see, it&#39;s a...surprise&quot; Rei is starting to become 
guilty with those lies

&quot;A surprise? Is it for me? Is it? Is it?&quot; Minako asked

&quot;Er...Y-yeah...for you...so stop bugging me and give time for your 
preparations&quot; Rei said

Minako gave her a puppy look

&quot;So mean! Pushing me away again! Well, I&#39;ll be waiting for your poem 
Rei-chan okay?&quot; The pop star said as she goes back to her staff

&quot;Minako-chan, is that your personal bodyguard?&quot; Asked the make-up artist

&quot;Yes, her name is Rei. She&#39;s a little quiet but I got used to it. I&#39;ll 
introduce you guys to her later&quot; Minako said as she list down the 
clothes and shoes she&#39;s going to wear orderly

&quot;Isn&#39;t she quite looking timid for a bodyguard?&quot;

&quot;Well, at first I really thought of that. I really haven&#39;t seen her in 
action yet&quot; Replied the pop star

&quot;It&#39;s not really important. What matters is Minako is safe right?&quot; Said 
Wendy

&quot;Yeah. Okay, enough of that and let&#39;s make a beauty plan&quot; Said the 
fashion designer

--

Venus is the goddess of love and beauty

Men unworthy doesn&#39;t deserve to lay even a single finger

Since no men for her is worthy

She instead seeks love from a mirror stranger

&quot;Venus...of course &#39;Venus&#39; here resembles Minako in this poem...her 
beauty is priceless...and the &#39;Mirror Stranger&#39; perhaps would be none 
other than me. Because when she faces the mirror, she sees her own 
image. She would see herself, literally. But by adding word &#39;Stranger&#39; 
changes the literal meaning into something else. Now the possible 
meaning of the &#39;Mirror Stranger&#39; is...A stranger with the same 
gender...&quot;

Now Rei is getting a bit close

&quot;But...What the hell is the sense of this? If there is no possible 
solution in the last four lines, then where could it be?&quot; She mumbled

The agent looked at Minako for a several minutes, thinking deep. Then 
her eyes went back on the paper, reading the comment given by Sanctuary 
after the last line of the poem. Little does she know Minako is 
observing her every other minute, noticing her troubled sighs

We do hope you understand this, because it&#39;s useless anyway

&quot;What&#39;s the use of reading this? It&#39;s just a farewell sentence...&quot; Rei 
sighed as she covers her hand on her forehead and eyes, feeling the 
stress and worries

Then she heard somebody singing. She heard that song before, not to 
mention the owner of that unique and angelic voice

Rei carefully takes off her hand from covering her eyes and turned to 
the source of the voice. It was Minako, singing her own song

For an unknown reason, Rei absent-mindedly paused in thinking about the 
poem and spent time in listening at Minako&#39;s voice. She registered every 
lyric that would came out of her pop star lover&#39;s lips in her mind

Your voice is like an angel

Your eyes are like the sea

Your hair is as soft as air

Your presence is intoxicating

I feel like new when I&#39;m with you

So please baby stay

And I&#39;ll take care of you

&#39;That was the song Minako sang to me last night&#39; Rei thought

&#39;What was the title of that again?&#39; She sweat dropped. If she asked 
Minako for the title of that song she would probably yell at Rei for not 
remembering her songs

She was silent for about ten seconds to concentrate on recalling the 
title of the song. Then finally a word came out of her mouth

&quot;Useless&quot;

&#39;That&#39;s right! That&#39;s the title of the song!&#39; Rei thought. Her inside 
relieved. But then her heart stopped, she reread the last sentence she 
had read:

We do hope you understand this, because it&#39;s useless anyway

&quot;Oh great, the conclusion&quot; Rei whispered sarcastically

&#39;Who knows the answer in this stupid riddle is in the line where it is 
easily ignored because of its simple meaning? Oh well, I need to know 
the rest of those lyrics. Minako is really an angel!&#39; Rei thought as she 
immediately rises up and headed towards the door

&#39;Minako&#39;s CD is at my apartment. I have to go there!&#39;

Wendy notices the agent in hurry

&quot;Ms. Hino, are you going somewhere?&quot; Minako&#39;s manager asked

Minako and the others followed to look at her

Rei looked at them with eyes blinking

&#39;Argh, I completely forgot about my job!&#39;

Then suddenly a bell sounded from the door

&quot;I-I was just opening the door&quot; Rei said. Saved by the bell

&quot;Who&#39;s there?&quot; Asked Rei as she peeks at the small glass hole at the 
center of the door to see the visitor

&quot;It&#39;s me, Hino&quot;

Rei opened the door for the head chief

&quot;Big boss, what are you doing here?&quot; Asked Rei

Minako rises up excitedly from her seat and ran towards to give the head 
chief a bear hug. The head chief blushed a bit

&quot;Biiig boooossss! I&#39;m so happy to see you again! We didn&#39;t talk this 
morning right?&quot; The pop star said

&quot;Uh...good evening Aino-san. I see that you are still awake. I just 
dropped by to make sure the agents I sent brought your staff here 
safely&quot; The head chief said

&quot;Oh, they picked us right on time and assisted us safely. Thank you very 
much for your assistance sir&quot; One of the make-up artists said

&quot;I&#39;m relieved that you have arrived safe and sound here&quot; Replied the 
head chief

Rei waited for them to get back to their planning activities then she 
talked to the head chief

&quot;You could have called me to confirm that&quot; commented Rei

&quot;You know me Hino. I&#39;d call you first of course. But I can see that you 
aren&#39;t wearing your earphone hmm?&quot; The head chief said as she looks at 
Rei&#39;s ears. Rei felt her ears and she felt no earphones attached. She 
blushed profusely

&quot;Gomen, big boss. My mind flew and I forgot my earphone at my uniform 
pocket&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s alright. It&#39;s just unusual that you forget wearing your earphone 
though. You&#39;re thinking too much about the riddle. Just leave it to me 
and the rest of us, we can solve it...somehow. All you have to worry 
about is how to protect Aino-san okay?&quot; The head chief said

Rei didn&#39;t listen to him. She grabbed the head chief&#39;s arm and turned 
him against Minako and the other&#39;s direction

&quot;Big boss stay here for a while, I&#39;ll come back immediately, don&#39;t let 
Minako follow me, please&quot; Whispered Rei as she opens the door and ran 
outside the hall. Leaving the head chief with no chance to speak

&quot;Hino! Wait--Rei!&quot;

Minako immediately stood up to catch up to her lover

&quot;Rei-chan! Where are you going again?&quot; Said the pop star as she runs 
towards the door but she was stopped by the head chief

&quot;Aino-san, please don&#39;t follow. Agent Hino had some other business to 
deal with, she will come back shortly. Please cooperate&quot; Said the head 
chief as he tries to gently stop Minako from struggling to break free 
from his mild grasps

&quot;B-but big boss&quot; Minako pouted

&quot;Minako&quot; Wendy called the pop star. In a cold voice

Minako turned to look at her manager. She was silenced when she saw the 
mix of frown and strictness in Wendy&#39;s stare. Minako finally stop 
struggling and walk back at her seat and sat down weakly and stared at 
the window. The head chief sighed in relief and whispered &#39;Thanks&#39; to 
Wendy, who smiled a bit

Minako&#39;s staff stares from the pop star to Wendy with a silent 
questioning gaze. Wendy just shook her head, telling them that it was 
nothing to worry about

--

-Outside the hotel-

Rei is running at the streets, glimpsing at the road, hoping that a taxi 
would pass by because it was almost midnight already and there are only 
few cars passing by. Her loosen hair flowed with the air and it was 
completely ignored how messed up it is now


&quot;I need to get to my house immediately! Please Kami-sama, I really need 
a taxi right now&quot; She pleaded

Then a taxi almost hit her as she crosses at the road. Rei was stunned 
as she realized her hands were on the top of the front car cover

&quot;Hey there young lady, I almost hit you!&quot; The taxi driver yelled

Rei looked at the driver and then at his car

&quot;TAXI!&quot;

--

Rei asked the taxi driver to wait for her as she arrives at her 
apartment and quickly took Minako&#39;s CD in there and went back to the 
taxi. But when she was about to get inside she saw a familiar figure 
three buildings away from them

It was that same young man with a feather yesterday. Rei took her gun up 
(my, finally firearms revealed :3) and run towards the suspicious young 
man, he wasn&#39;t an imagination after all

The young man noticed that Rei is coming after him so he started to run 
away

&quot;Freeze Tokyo Police!&quot; Yelled Rei

&quot;Hey lady! What about me?&quot; Asked the taxi driver

&quot;I&#39;ll come back, don&#39;t you dare leave!&quot; Warned Rei as she places back 
her gun in her belt case

&quot;Of course I won&#39;t leave, you haven&#39;t paid me yet! Just hurry, will 
you?&quot; He replied nervously

--

Rei went after the man in the dark streets of Tokyo. The young man runs 
fast but that won&#39;t make Rei stop chasing after him. The young man led 
the agent in many streets and turned left and right several times. But 
Rei wasn&#39;t bothered since she perfectly knew the place

Finally the young man&#39;s figure disappeared from sight. Rei stopped and 
heaved. She breathlessly observed the place where the young man led her

She was at a dead end. The place was dark and abandoned. The only light 
that can be seen is from the moon and stars above. She heard footsteps 
behind her; she moves her hand to take the gun carefully and silently 
out. But at the half-way of taking it out a voice talked to her

&quot;No need for that Hino-chan. I assure that you will get out of here 
alive and unscratched if you follow our instructions peacefully&quot;

Rei calmed down a bit and placed her gun back. She turned to look at the 
people behind her. She saw five pairs of feet standing in front of her a 
few meters away. But she couldn&#39;t recognize their faces because there 
wasn&#39;t enough light. She tried to move forward for a better view

&quot;Stay where you are. Remember the conditions&quot; Another voice talked

&quot;So you had planned this perfectly, do you?&quot; Rei said

&quot;Oh, yes. I figured you would come out every time within tonight. We 
know what you&#39;re capable of Hino-chan, you are smarter and a lot tougher 
than you look&quot; The first voice said

&quot;Stop calling me that, I&#39;m not your friend. Besides, you sound like gay 
when you do that&quot; Rei said, judging by the accent of their voices, she 
figured out they&#39;re from somewhere in Europe (except for the name 
&#39;Hino-chan&#39;)

&quot;Oh Hino-chan, you are hurting my feelings. But you are right. We aren&#39;t 
your friends...yet&quot; Replied the first voice

&quot;What do you mean &#39;Yet&#39;?&quot; Asked Rei annoyingly

&quot;Because we thought if we introduce ourselves to you then probably we 
would be friends. Then I&#39;ll call you Hino-chan again&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t have to because I already know you&quot; Rei said

&quot;Then allow us introduce ourselves formally&quot; A mild voice talked

&quot;You are totally wasting my time!&quot;

&quot;Why? Is it because Minako Aino is waiting for you?&quot; Asked the second 
voice menacingly

&quot;I&#39;m not really surprised that you already knew&quot; Rei replied 
sarcastically

&quot;Please give us time Rei-san. This might help you in saving...her&quot; The 
mild voice talked again

Rei, for an unknown reason calmed down and stopped talking to start 
listening to them. The man who first talked walked forward, enough to 
hide his face near Rei

&quot;To begin our meeting, we should introduce ourselves in our traditional 
way...Hino-chan, we are the men...called Sanctuary&quot;

-A short strip-

(This is not included in the story...well, it was suppose to be but I 
just want to type this)

Agent Rinka Kimimoto have done something wrong and the head chief found 
out and was about to fire the poor young agent when he was stopped by 
Rei and Minako

&quot;Please don&#39;t fire agent Kimimoto Big boss!&quot; Minako pleaded

&quot;Rinka-chan&#39;s a great agent, we can&#39;t lose another great agent Big boss&quot; 
Rei followed

&quot;Aino-san...Rei-sama...&quot; Rinka is now teary-eyed

The head chief sighed

&quot;This is a hard decision to make but...well...I guess what just happened 
will stand as a lesson to you Kimimoto. But I won&#39;t let you away that 
easily. Tomorrow meet me at my office and start cleaning everything in 
sight. You&#39;ll do that for three months for your disobedience&quot; The head 
chief said

Rinka is now crying for joy and hugged the head chief then turned to hug 
Minako and Rei at the same time

&quot;Thank you big bo-I mean head chief! I&#39;ll clean your office for three 
months-no, make it six months! I deserve that!&quot; Said Rinka

Rei groaned then sweat dropped

&quot;I don&#39;t get it, I&#39;d rather be fired than to clean big boss&#39; office that 
long&quot; The raven haired girl commented

&quot;What&#39;s wrong with you cleaning big boss&#39; office anyway, Rei-chan?&quot; 
Minako asked

Rei thought for a while

&quot;Well...&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;...&quot;

&quot;Because this office smells like him, an old coconut fruit!&quot; Said Rei as 
she started to run out of the head chief&#39;s office laughing hysterically

It took few seconds for the head chief to register what Rei said

&quot;HIIIIIIINNNNNNOOOOOOO!&quot;

The head chief chased his niece the whole afternoon in the Tokyo Police 
headquarters...Minako and Rinka just sweat dropped
