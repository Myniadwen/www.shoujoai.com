fanfiction by <a href="../authors/arashi.html">arashi-enkou</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;BWAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAA!&quot; a Cupid-like youma cackled evilly.

&quot;Son-of-a--&quot; Sailor Jupiter&#39;s curse was cut short as she dodged another 
volley of heart-tipped arrows.

&quot;Crap,&quot; The Thunder Senshi cursed as she limped away. &quot;Ami!&quot; she shouted 
at the Water Senshi that was clinging to her leg like a monkey. &quot;Do you 
KNOW how hard it is to dodge with one leg!?!?&quot; The blunette had 
apparently ignored her in favor of rubbing her cheek against the chef&#39;s 
leg. &quot;Mako-chan!&quot; the genius gushed happily.

&quot;LET GO!&quot;

&quot;STOP TESTING OUR LOVE!&quot; Sailor Mercury wailed.

&quot;WHAT LOVE!?!?&quot; Sailor Jupiter fumed. &quot;We&#39;ve only been dating for a 
WEEK!&quot;

Sailor Mercury blinked once, then continued to rub her cheek against 
Jupiter&#39;s leg. &quot;For the love of Pete!&quot; Jupiter growled.

&quot;You think YOU&#39;VE got it bad?&quot; a voice said dryly. Sailor Jupiter turned 
to see Sailor Venus, caught in the embrace of a bubbly Sailor Pluto.

&quot;Oh Minako-channnnn!&quot; the Time Senshi purred as she rubbed her cheek on 
the top of Sailor Venus&#39; head. &quot;I wuv you!&quot;

Sailor Venus&#39; eyebrow twitched as the overly-affectionate woman kissed 
her cheek, cooeing in baby-talk. &quot;I think I liked her better when she 
was cold and distant.&quot; The Love Senshi monotoned.

Sailor Pluto took this as a sign of affection and squealed happily. &quot;Oh 
Minako-chan!&quot; she giggled. She then grabbed the blonde and kissed her 
smack-dab on the lips.

&quot;Never-mind.&quot; Sailor Venus thickly, a goofy grin on her face as Sailor 
Pluto wrapped her in another embrace. &quot;I like this Setsuna lots better.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s, &#39;much better&#39; not &#39;lots better&#39; Minako-chan.&quot; Sailor Mercury 
scolded.

Sailor Venus shrugged. &quot;Whatever.&quot;

&quot;Gah!&quot; Sailor Moon shrieked as she ran away from the waves of evil love 
arrows. &quot;Someone help!&quot; Sailor Mars sprinted to the moon hime&#39;s side, 
swooping the blonde in her arms bridle-style as she leaped onto a nearby 
branch. &quot;You okay?&quot; the Fire Senshi asked the blonde in her arms.

Blushing, Sailor Moon nodded shyly as she wrapped her arms around Sailor 
Mars&#39; neck.

&quot;MUAHAHAHAHAHAAAA!&quot; The Cupid-youma cackled. &quot;YOU SHALL NEVER DEFEAT 
LOVE!&quot;

&quot;Hey!&quot; Sailor Moon cried, offended. &quot;We&#39;re SOLIDERS for love and 
justice! Shouldn&#39;t you be on OUR side or something&quot;

Cupid-youma blinked. &quot;Oh. You guys are...Love Soliders?&quot;

Sailor Mars leaped from the branch and set Sailor Moon down onto her 
feet. &quot;That&#39;s about right.&quot; the fire maiden said as she rubbed her 
shoulder blades. &quot;Jeez Odango-atama,&quot; she complained to Sailor Moon. 
&quot;You need to lose some weight.&quot;

&quot;WHY YOU LITTLE-&quot; Sailor Moon&#39;s rant was cut short as a Love Arrow hit 
her chest. She gasped in pain and feel into a worried Sailor Mars&#39; arms.

&quot;Usagi-chan!&quot; Sailor Mars cried, holding the still form of her friend. 
&quot;Usagi! USAGI!&quot; Sailor Moon&#39;s eyes fluttered open.

Sailor Mars sighed in relief as she helped a shaky Sailor Moon to her 
feet. &quot;Are you o-why are you looking at me like that&quot;

Sailor Moon was staring at her with half-lidded eyes, grinning impishly.

&quot;Usagi?&quot; Sailor Mars asked timidly. &quot;What&#39;s--?&quot; She was cut off as 
Sailor Moon suddenly pulled her into a kiss.

&quot;MFF!?!?!&quot; Sailor Mars waved her arms wildly in the air as she struggled 
to get away from the blonde. She grabbed Sailor Moon&#39;s shoulders and, 
with great difficulty, pulled the blonde off of her. She gasped in a few 
mouthfuls of air.

&quot;U-Usagi!&quot; she sputtered. &quot;W-What the hell?!?! Why are you-&quot;

&quot;I love you, I don&#39;t care about Mamoru, Seiya&#39;s only a friend, and screw 
Cystal Tokyo.&quot; The moon hime responded simply.

Sailor Mars blinked. &quot;Okay, but what about Chibi-&quot; She was cut off once 
again by Sailor Moon whipping out the Disguise Pen.

&quot;Will this work?&quot; Sailor Moon said coyly.

Sailor Mars blinked once, twice, before she shrugged. &quot;Well,&quot; she began. 
&quot;There goes all the reason&#39;s for me to say &#39;no&quot;

She opened her arms. &quot;Come to mama!&quot; she yelled, grinning.

Sailor Moon squealed and eagerly jumped into the Fire Senshi&#39;s arms, 
knocking both of them into a nearby bush.

Cupid-youma stared at the bush, then at the still quivering bow-string.

&quot;Oops.&quot; he murmured. Sailor Jupiter limped toward him.

&quot;Can you get her off?&quot; she asked dryly, pointing to the giggling Sailor 
Mercury that clung to her leg. &quot;Oh.&quot; Cupid-youma took out a Love-Arrow 
from his quiver, then poked Sailor Mercury with the tip. The blunette 
blinked many times, shaking her head. &quot;Makoto,&quot; she murmured, &quot;what 
hap-&quot; she looked up, only to see underneath Sailor Jupiter&#39;s skirt.

&quot;Oh my,&quot; she whispered as she blushed hotly. Then, with no warning, the 
blunette fainted.

Cupid-youma walked over to Sailor Venus and Pluto. &quot;No, I wuv YOU!&quot; The 
blonde cooed in baby-talk.

&quot;No I wuv YOU!&quot; The green-haired Senshi cooed back, pinching the Love 
Senshi&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Oh now THAT is just sick.&quot; Cupid-youma growled. He jabbed the Time 
Senshi&#39;s arm with the Love Arrow&#39;s tip. Sailor Pluto blinked and shook 
her head wildly. She looked at Sailor Venus, then at her hands which 
were pinching the Love Senshi&#39;s cheeks.

She turned questioning red orbs to Sailor Venus&#39; innocent blue ones. The 
blonde smiled (albeit with difficulty) and said timidly, &quot;I wuv you?&quot;

Sailor Pluto shrugged and cooed, &quot;And I wuv YOU Minako-koi!&quot; She began 
to coo uninteligible sounds, Sailor Venus giggling all the while.

&quot;You people sicken me.&quot; Cupid-youma growled. He then turned to the bush. 
As he approached, Cupid-youma became aware of the...HAPPY noises which 
were coming from the quivering bush. Cupid-youma stopped dead and 
blushed hotly.

&quot;Maybe you should leave them alone for a little bit...&quot; Sailor Jupiter 
advised, blushing as well.

&quot;Yeah...&quot;

Cupid-youma turned to face the rest of the Senshi. &quot;Weeeellllll you 
guys,&quot; he began, &quot;It&#39;s been fun, but now I gotta-&quot;

Then, quite suddenly, a pink bra landed on his head, covering his eyes.

&quot;...That&#39;s not what I think it is, is it?&quot;</pre>
