<h1>Spice with a Pint of Life (part 9 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/spicepint-ch8.html">Back to Part 8</a><pre>There was a crowd of people parked outside the local television store. 
Each person was trying to get a good look at the screens that were 
playing Rei and Minako&#39;s live performance.

Only...the tape had been played over a hundred times by now.

Among the energetic group was a couple that wasn&#39;t quite...so energetic. 
The &#39;man&#39; was a gorgeous raven-haired figure, although none of his 
admirers could understand why anyone would want to wear a hat and a suit 
on a hot day such as this. Beside him, the cause for much envy on part 
of the female populace on this one particular block, was a blonde woman 
who was also wearing a hat, her hair up in a ponytail, but her dress 
attire was more appropriate. Unlike her partner she was wearing a tank 
top and shorts. To top it all off, sunglasses covered her eyes, keeping 
people guessing at what her eye color could really be and what they 
really looked like. They must have been as beautiful to match the rest 
of her body if the gentlemen had &#39;chosen&#39; her right?

Maybe the man was a foreigner? Many people concluded.

The blonde slipped one arm around her &#39;boyfriend&#39;s&#39; arm and giggled 
about something he was reading in the newspaper. In return the man gave 
an acknowledging grunt.

What could be so interesting about a newspaper?

Headline: New duo group a smash hit!

Everyone thought that this group would be like the others. Dressed up in 
some fancy clothes, crack jokes before a performance with the crowd or 
repeat a saying over and over again as their gimmick but it was not 
meant to be. Now this debuting duo had something that stood them apart 
from all the rest, so much that even I, the prideful writer am willing 
to admit that I thought they were SENSATIONAL.

You must all be wondering what I&#39;m talking about right? If you are, 
SHAME ON YOU! That means you must have not seen their spectacular 
performance! (insert sad face)

Hino Rei, the second member of the duo made an entrance that mesmerized 
the crowd! Unlike her beautiful blonde partner who had been positioned 
on stage (and where many thought Hino san would be as well), the 
raven-haired woman made her appearance atop of a stadium entranceway! 
Even I was spell bound.

Instead of the normal &#39;dress the girl up pretty&#39; routine, we get Hino 
Rei, who brought her own standard of beauty. She was soaked from head to 
toe as though she had been in the rain and her outfit consisted of 
nothing but the casual of the casual...yet she had the look of a fierce 
animal! (Wooooo) There was fire in those amethyst eyes I tell you! Every 
person in the crowd could see the unstoppable force that embodied this 
young woman.

Well, don&#39;t think she just stood there either! From the top of a stadium 
entranceway, she sprinted down to the stage, topping it all off by 
finishing with a graceful flip and landed without flaw beside Aino 
Minako. The music began to pick up and it was nothing but sweet sunset 
the rest of the way.

Personally I liked how Minako and Rei mixed it up in what they tried to 
portray. Aino san was dressed up as the dazzling &#39;goddess of love&#39; that 
all of us have come to expect. Rei on the other hand contributed to the 
crowd a sense of belonging in the highly admired life of stardom. Being 
dressed like an ordinary person without all the glamour, any of us could 
only dream of being in her place and could not help BUT cheer the fiery 
temptress as she took the stage.

So there you have it. My overall review? Nothing short of perfection! 
Give it all you got girls, we&#39;re all cheering for you!

Minako&#39;s POV

I was watching Rei with great interest now (not that I ever don&#39;t); 
every now and then as she re-read that silly article over and over 
again, she would twitch, whether it was an arm, leg or eyebrow. Usually 
the eyebrow though, which I was glad because she looks the silliest that 
way.

So cute!

I had managed to drag her out of the shrine for a walk, but it took 
quite a bit of convincing I&#39;m afraid. Poor stubborn Rei...you&#39;d think 
she wouldn&#39;t have problem with crowds but it turns out she has a 
claustrophobic side to her. Well, that&#39;s what I think it is but she 
keeps insisting she dislikes being around smelly people who would do 
nothing but stare at her.

So after a long discussion, the two of us decided it would be best to 
use a disguise. I know, I know, a &#39;no duh&#39; answer but the type of 
disguise was the hard part! I don&#39;t think I had to think as hard as I 
did for a loooong time. I mean there was the old, change the hairstyle 
and wear some goofy hat and sunglasses look but that just didn&#39;t suit 
Rei. No...we ended up applying the creative/original side our duo was 
known for (I didn&#39;t know we even had one!) but here we are.

&quot;They&#39;re staring...&quot; Rei finally mumbled again. Her eyes were shifting 
from the paper in her hands to the sides, looking very, very annoyed. I 
could tell she was doing her best from growling outright at her 
admirers.

&quot;Is the heat bothering you dear? I told you the suit wasn&#39;t a good 
idea.&quot; I said a little louder than necessary. My arm tightened around 
Rei&#39;s, giving a slight tug to the side, telling her we can go.

&quot;Uhh...yes.&quot; Was all Rei could mumble, &quot;Dear.&quot; She quickly added when 
she saw the hungry looks she was getting from the group of girls to her 
left.

Giggling I pulled her away from the crowd at last, giving her some air 
and relief that she desperately needed.

Originally we were going to the park but I just HAD to stop and watch 
our performance again! I wonder when Manuke is going to give us a taped 
copy anyway? When I asked him over the phone this morning, he said a few 
of the camera monitors that recorded the performance experienced 
&#39;technical difficulties&#39;. Whatever that means. Oh well, I hope it&#39;s 
fixed soon. Rei really was something during our performance. Thinking 
about it was making me...

&quot;Mina chan, why are you squealing?&quot; I saw Rei blink back at me. 
Confusion played in her dark, amethyst eyes, bringing something back to 
my memory-she never used to show this much emotion back when, did she?

&quot;Ah, n-nothing. I was...just excited about our talk show interview! 
Ahaha...haha...&quot;

Rei looked down at her watch and frowned. &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t look like 
you&#39;ll have to wait too long. We&#39;re due at the studio in an hour.&quot;

&quot;Come on, it&#39;ll be fun! Don&#39;t worry so much. As Haruka said in the 
newspaper, they&#39;re all cheering for us.&quot; I ran up a bit and spun around, 
tipping my shades down as I did so. &quot;Right?&quot;

&quot;...Hm...&quot; The raven-haired &#39;man&#39; nodded.

She wasn&#39;t being very talkative today...it kinda made me worry if 
something was bothering her. I mean, the performance was a hit! I 
thought she&#39;d be a little more excited than this.

&quot;So are we set for the park still?&quot;

&quot;Uh, hello? H-hey!&quot; I automatically stepped back when one of her hands 
was suddenly in my face.

&quot;Keep the shades on! Do you want to be found out?&quot; She hissed. Although 
I could have sworn I saw her smirk.

Mm...Humph. &quot;Meanie.&quot;

Rei&#39;s POV

Why am I dressed like a man again? And in a hot sweltering suit no less! 
Ahh! I just wanted to scream.

&quot;Hmm...hm..hm...&quot; Mina hummed beside me. Well...at least one of us was 
cheerful. As usual, it was you know who.

I was surprised when she suddenly lowered her shades back there; after 
getting used to seeing those plain, boring glasses it was like &#39;bam!&#39;, 
hit by a truck! If people at the concert thought I left them mesmerized, 
obviously they haven&#39;t seen Mina up close. Good thing too for that 
matter...wait, no, no, I am NOT jealous! I&#39;m just worried about a mob of 
males drooling all over my best friend.

&quot;Something wrong Rei chan?&quot; I felt a tug on my sleeve.

&quot;No.&quot;

&quot;Liar.&quot; She gave a laugh.

Damn, I don&#39;t get it! I&#39;ve been doing things the way I always have yet 
she&#39;s been seeing through me lately. Am I slipping up with my facial 
expressions or something?

Instead of a verbal response I tried to ignore her. Which wasn&#39;t a good 
idea when I think about it now.

Before I realized my mistake, a hand was pinching my cheek, forcing me 
to meet her eyes.

&quot;Spill.&quot;

&quot;L-et go.&quot;

We both glared at each other for a few minutes, unwilling to back down. 
That was, until I saw her raise an eyebrow. &quot;You really are a hard-head 
sometimes,&quot; she said, releasing me from the death grip or the &#39;cheek 
pinch&#39;, as Mina would sometimes dub it. Feeling my freedom fully 
regained I rubbed the injured spot knowing full well that it was glowing 
a bright red.

This really wasn&#39;t good. Was it just me, or am I becoming whipped?

&quot;I&#39;m the hard-head? Look who&#39;s talking.&quot; I sped up my walking pace.

&quot;But we&#39;re friends Rei!&quot; She sighed, looking exasperated for the first 
time since this morning. The word friend made me cringe for some 
unexplainable reason. &quot;I can worry about you can&#39;t I?&quot;

I guess...she could. &quot;...It&#39;s, erm...well, I&#39;m not used to being this 
famous.&quot; I finally mumbled.

Which was part of the problem.

Everywhere we looked there were posters with Mina and myself posing. 
They would be on store windows advertising our first single release to 
playing our concert performance on the large screen television sets. I 
mean, what was the big deal? I&#39;m still the same person I was the day 
before the concert and then it&#39;s like poof, I&#39;m famous? I exist?

&quot;I get that too. But you&#39;ll get used to it,&quot; Mina smiled. &quot;I know I 
already have.&quot;

Right, maybe I&#39;ll get used to it. Just maybe...as long as those crazy 
fans don&#39;t find out where I live, I think I can manage.

&quot;Yeah. But enough of this, we better get to the station before our 
&#39;manager&#39; goes crazy.&quot;

I wasn&#39;t too worried about Manuke trying to kill me so soon. Since the 
incident at the concert, the police have rounded up quite a few of those 
bodyguards. None of them have talked yet but it could be any day now 
that they&#39;ll spill the beans. And if they didn&#39;t...well, let&#39;s just say 
our manager is trying to stay on the low until the whole case is blown 
over.

Minako&#39;s POV, talk show

In no time flat we arrived with fifteen minutes to spare. During that 
time, we did the usual girl things, or I did anyway. Both of us changed 
into our usual attire and I did my hair. After some argument, I even 
managed to convince Rei to let me do her make-up for her. She didn&#39;t 
want any at first but that didn&#39;t take too much convincing to change her 
mind.

Silly Rei-chan, I silently smirked at the memory.

So here we are now, waiting for the show to start. Rei sat to my direct 
left as our host quickly learned not to try to come between us...Tense 
atmosphere, deep glares, bad vibes? What can I say, Rei has is all down 
pat.

&quot;We&#39;re on in...5...4...3...&quot; I squirmed slightly in my seat. It was just 
so exciting! I can&#39;t believe they bring in an audience and everything! 
I&#39;ve always watched this stuff on t.v. but I never expected to be a part 
of it. &quot;...2...1...on air!&quot;

As soon as the red light turned on, our talk show host jumped into 
action, greeting, &quot;Hello to all you faithful viewers out there!&quot; She 
paused as the audience cheered and died down. &quot;You know who I am, I know 
who I am, but how about our two guest stars? All of you are in for a 
treat because here we have the fast rising duo, Rei and Minako!&quot;

Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap! 
Clap! Clap! Clap! Clap!

I gave my best smile, loving all this attention. Rei on the other hand, 
had her custom frown on. I guess we really do look like exact opposites. 
Oh, well, can&#39;t be helped.

&quot;So, I&#39;m sure our audience was wondering, what made you two choose the 
name &#39;Fire Soul Love&#39; for your group? It&#39;s rather unique and has a nice 
ring to it. Actually I adore it, it&#39;s so cute yet professional all mixed 
together, don&#39;t you think?&quot; The woman continued on.

&quot;What made us choose the name?&quot; I glanced over to Rei, wondering if I 
should really tell the truth. Mm...but it looked like Rei didn&#39;t 
care-she just shrugged, looking indifferent to what was happening. &quot;We 
wished to convey our music with a sense of passion, one that only true 
love in both of our opinions could rival.&quot;

There was a string of &#39;ahh&#39;s, throughout the room including one from our 
host.

&quot;Oh, I see, I see, very creative and expressive Aino san, Hino san. I 
must admit, I&#39;m nothing short of impressed.&quot;

Rei gave a grunt, prompting me to quickly jab her in the side with an 
elbow.

&quot;Hino san, if I may say, that was an amazing entrance you made during 
your debut performance.&quot; There was a slight pause when the former fire 
senshi refused to speak.

Come on Rei, say something! I silently pleaded. This is important. I 
doubt I could keep elbowing her without anyone noticing!

My prayers must have been answered when our eyes briefly connected.

&quot;Oh, well, thank you.&quot; Rei suddenly straightened up her posture, 
portraying her business like pose. This had attracted the crowd&#39;s 
attention greatly, much to Rei&#39;s discontent.

&quot;So tell me the truth, was that entirely planned?&quot;

&quot;Yes.&quot; Her eyes bore into the woman. I was starting to wonder if she was 
trying to scare her into leaving her alone. I know I would...if...and 
that was an if...I wasn&#39;t who I was. After you spend some time with the 
miko, you build up this anti-glare immunity. Rather handy I must admit. 
&quot;Any more questions?&quot;

&quot;O-Oh, yes, actually there is one.&quot; For a moment the woman looked afraid 
to venture on, but this was show biz. It was nice that someone else knew 
the feeling, even if the pressure was from Rei and not a stadium full of 
cheering people. Tsk, my bad. I shouldn&#39;t be thinking this way! Ooooh, 
Artemis would definitely not approve if he were here. &quot;A few of your 
fans have written in and asked what&#39;s the relationship between yourself 
and Aino san was.&quot;

Silence floored the room. If someone had dropped a pin, all of us would 
have been able to hear it hit the floor.

In my case, I could only hear my racing heart beat, hoping no one else 
could hear it. What would Rei say? I know she rarely admits her personal 
feelings to her friends, much less than a crowd of strangers.

&quot;No comment.&quot;

Those two words sent the room in an uproar while leaving me releasing a 
breath I never knew that I held in. Typical Rei-chan. I couldn&#39;t but 
smile; she never changes.

&quot;If you&#39;re single, I&#39;m available!&quot;

&quot;Aino-san!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m your biggest fan!&quot;

&quot;Unfortunately our time has run out. Thank you again Hino san, Aino san, 
for coming. Until next time loyal viewers!&quot;

Dressing room, immediately after the show

Rei flopped down on the nearest couch with a frown crossing her strict 
features. Normally she would have dropped that face when we were alone 
but not this time oddly enough.

&quot;Traumatizing enough for you?&quot; I teased and took a seat beside her with 
what little room was left on the couch. She wasn&#39;t kidding when she said 
she&#39;s always does things full way. When she sprawls out, she really 
sprawls out!

I found her eyes glaring up at me and I smiled back. Score one for the 
anti-glare shield! &quot;Whatever. It looked like you were handling yourself 
just fine before that crazy woman pounced at me.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t tell me those questions made you nervous?&quot;

&quot;Of course not.&quot;

&quot;Oh? Then what was that &#39;no comment&#39; for?&quot;

There was a pause. &quot;That&#39;s what I meant, No. Comment.&quot; She pushed 
herself up and retracted her limbs, leaving me more room to scoot 
closer. Which was exactly what I did. I was a little tired from the 
adrenaline rush and I already missed my teddy bear.

I noticed the woman giving me a wary look as I leaned into her side.

&quot;Relax Rei-chan, I don&#39;t bite.&quot;

For a moment I thought I saw a blush spreading across her features, but 
I must have being imagining it. Now I know I don&#39;t bite, I felt myself 
frown. Unless you counted biting your own tongue while eating too fast, 
I&#39;d have to give that thought a negative.

&quot;Oh, I almost forgot.&quot; I commented casually. I usually forget a lot of 
things but this one had been in my mind for quite a while. &quot;I got a call 
from Manuke&#39;s company last night. Not Manuke.&quot; I quickly added when I 
saw the questioning stare. Rei immediately relaxed. &quot;They said since our 
popularity is rising, we&#39;re going to have to spend a lot more time 
together for synching reasons. As the man on the other line put it, a 
duo is meant for two people.&quot;

&quot;And...?&quot; There was an edge to Rei&#39;s voice.

&quot;We&#39;re going to be living together.&quot;

Her jaw dropped. Yes Rei-chan, you relaxed too soon.

Rei&#39;s POV, new apartment

Click.

I shut the door behind us as we entered the room for where we had to 
live for the next...I gulped, while. It could be a long...long while.

I never saw this coming. Nothing could have prepared me for this! It was 
such a blessing and a curse nicely wrapped up in a package. Living with 
Mina-chan herself wouldn&#39;t be too hard. I mean, she&#39;s a very nice 
person, understanding, kind, patient (sometimes) and well...just a nice 
person overall. Now if I got into the pieces of personality where she 
unconsciously tortures me, then we have a problem.

I watched the blonde woman stroll to the balcony and raise her arms to 
stretch them, bringing up her shirt slightly in the process.

A very big problem.

&quot;What do you think Rei?&quot; She slowly turned around to face me.

A lot of things.

&quot;Nothing really. It&#39;s a nice place, I have to admit that at least.&quot;

Mina nodded. &quot;I think so too! But I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be here very often 
with all of our engagements. Things are going to get a little rougher 
with our schedules. On the bright side though! We&#39;ll get to spend time 
doing it together-it would be lonely doing something like this all alone 
don&#39;t you think?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s true...but we still have one more day before that starts.&quot;

We could always kick back and relax...or I could go back to the shrine 
and help out with some of the chores. Knowing Grandpa, he will probably 
shoo me away or something knowing my recent surge in popularity... but 
honestly...he can&#39;t do it all himself.

&quot;I want a date.&quot; I thought I heard Mina mumble.

&quot;Hm? Oh. You know, I bet if you ask the company you can order some 
in...&quot;

&#39;Not that kind of date Rei!&quot; She laughed at me, clutching her stomach as 
she did so.

I crossed my arms. Well excuse me for not having perverted thoughts 
twenty-four seven.

&quot;Mina, we both know you can make a man swoon all over you without 
batting an eyelash. It wouldn&#39;t be hard for you to get a guy to take you 
out.&quot; Inside I thought I could feel my heart twisting as I repeated 
every word through my mind. It was true wasn&#39;t it? Why bother denying 
it? She could probably get any guy she wanted without trying.

Her gaze fell. &quot;I guess...&quot; That wasn&#39;t the reaction I was expecting. 
Instead of getting another smile and an exaggerated bow, I was stung by 
the strong sense of disappointment in that voice. It made me 
think...Since we did have one free day left, maybe...

&quot;But...maybe that would be too much trouble,&quot; I carefully chose my 
words. &quot;If...If you like, I can take you out. We can do whatever you 
want to do.&quot;

&quot;Really...?&quot; There was a look of disbelief on her face.

I nodded.

&quot;EeEeeeeee! Thank you!&quot; AHHHHH!

Whop! Thud!

The flying hug shrill...I haven&#39;t heard that one for awhile. I smiled 
despite the other rush of emotions bombarding me now. There were so many 
things that could go wrong that it wasn&#39;t even funny. We could be found 
out despite our disguises, the weather could go bad or even worse, we&#39;d 
run into our &#39;manager who&#39;s name I will not say&#39;.

Most of all though, I tried to ignore the feeling when Mina leaned down 
and whispered into my ear, &quot;I&#39;d like that very much.&quot;
