<h1>Mistaken Assumption (part 3 of 5)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/immeblue.html">Immeblue</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/misass-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Makoto sat at her computer drinking tea that Monday morning.  She had 
been  away a whole weekend and wanted to check her mail, though she had 
an  omniscient feeling that it was all junk.  She disconnected her 
Instant  Messenger, the last thing she wanted was for Azure to come on 
and talk to  her.  She didn&#39;t want to read those hurtful words again.  

Makoto gave a harsh sigh, &#145;just junk&#39; she thought as she deleted the 
first  page of crap, nothing she even subscribed for.  The second page 
appeared and  was similar to the last but one thing on this page put an 
outright frown on  Makoto&#39;s face.  An email from Azure, subject: why 
I&#39;m afraid. Sure that it  was more Nat bashing Makoto had no motivation 
to open the letter, but she  sat there staring at it nonetheless.  

Her mind began to argue with itself on the pros and cons of opening it.   
Only there was one pro and one con that made any difference to Makoto.  
pro;  she might find out that Azure isn&#39;t really afraid of her, con; 
she finds out  that Azure is.  She figured that the con was much more 
realistic and likely  than the pro.  Fed up with thinking about it any 
longer and deathly sure  that the email contained news that won&#39;t make 
her mood any better, Makoto  sent all the email on the whole page to be 
deleted.   

Makoto used her last ounce of energy to push the gym doors open and 
just  about fell onto the bench a few feet away.  She laid on her back 
and took in  gigantic gulps of air, her lungs felt completely empty and 
her body was  heaving.  Every muscle she possessed was throbbing, 
Makoto knew she over did  it, but she had to.  After deleting that 
email from Azure she couldn&#39;t stop  thinking about it or her, and 
thought some exercise would be the trick.  It  wasn&#39;t, so Makoto 
increased the level of difficultly and pushed herself  harder.  That 
worked for awhile, except somehow Azure made her way into  Makoto&#39;s 
mind again.  Makoto finally realized it was hopeless when her body  was 
spent and the only prominent thoughts running through her mind was  
Azure, and how the need for air was overwhelming.  

It was a whole hour before her body gave her the go-ahead, but the only  
place Makoto went was to the baths and then a massage therapist.  She 
needed  the steaming hot water to soothe her aches and the therapist to 
ease  whatever the water didn&#39;t.  All the while with thoughts of that 
woman, and  her mail.  &#145;Why can&#39;t I stop thinking about her?  Maybe I 
just need someone  new, replace her.&#39;  Though Makoto didn&#39;t feel any 
better, she knew it was  easier said than done.   

Once at home she found herself sitting in front of her computer.  This 
time  she was staring at the emails she deleted this morning, one in 
particular.   Makoto still didn&#39;t have the desire to open it, but she 
didn&#39;t feel so sure  about deleting it as she had just that morning.  
Instead she created a  folder for it and left it to be forgotten, 
hopefully.  

Acting on impulse she blocked Azure from sending her mail and as a  
precaution blocked her from sending her IM&#39;s.  Makoto took a deep 
breath as  the magnitude of what she has done hit her.  She had just 
cut off all  communication with the woman she loved.  However, she left 
everything the  way it was as Azure&#39;s words, as they do very often, 
came to mind &quot;&#145;I wanna  see you too.  But I have to admit I&#39;m 
afraid.&#39;&quot;  &#145;How could you be afraid of  someone you love?&#39;  Makoto 
didn&#39;t want to think about the obvious answer to  her question and 
quickly thought of something else.  A smile appeared on her  face as 
she remembered Ami&#39;s words &quot;&#145;you probably thought _you_ could scare  
me.  It&#39;ll never happen.&#39;&quot;
