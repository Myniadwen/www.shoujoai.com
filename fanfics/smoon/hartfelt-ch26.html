<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 26 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch25.html">Back to Part 25</a><p><u>(Usagi, Twin’s Bedroom)</u></p><p>It was late at night when Usagi finally returned to 
her room. She stopped in front of the door and looked at the crack beneath it to see that no 
lights were on. Was Hotaru already inside? A little nervous, she turned the door-knob and 
slipped inside.</p><p>The first thing her gaze fell to was the bed on the far side of the 
room. It was empty. Her gaze wandered then towards the terrace, and there she found her 
sister.</p><p><i>Hotaru... Not again...</i></p><p>Hotaru was standing on the balcony, 
staring out at who knew what. How long had she been standing there this 
time?</p><p>“Hotaru.” Usagi called out to her. It took a second for the woman to realize 
that she was being addressed.</p><p>“Good evening, Usagi. I see that you’ve finally 
returned.” There was a strange tone in Hotaru’s voice as she said this. Also, it may have 
been the lighting but her sibling didn’t look very well. There were dark shadows starting to 
form under her eyes and she was very pale-- far more than usual. It looked as if she hadn’t 
slept for days.</p><p><i>She looks so pale...</i></p><p>“You’re going to take Luna’s re-test 
tomorrow morning, aren’t you? I would recommend getting some sleep if I were you. She likes 
to administer her tests early.”</p><p>“But what about you...?”</p><p>“I’ll be fine. I’m not 
really that tired at the moment, so you go on ahead.”</p><p>Usagi had almost obeyed her 
request until she remembered her earlier talk in the library with Rei.</p><p>“<i>If you 
don’t talk to her, then none of you will be able to move forward.”</i></p><p><i>That’s 
right. There’s clearly something bothering her, and... As her sister, I should let her know 
that I’m there for her.</i></p><p>“Hey, Hotaru...?” She walked onto the balcony and saw her 
turn her head, looking startled.</p><p>“Usagi?”</p><p>Usagi reached forward and clasped her 
hands in hers. She noted how Hotaru went tense.</p><p>“Can I... talk to you about something? 
There’s been something on my mind lately, and... I was really hoping we could talk about 
it.”</p><p>“Well...I don’t mind, but what about your test?”</p><p>“I’ll be quick. I 
promise.”</p><p>Hotaru finally nodded back. “...All right. So, what did you want to talk 
about?”</p><p>“Well, how can I put it? It’s not so much about what’s on my mind...as it is 
yours.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“These last few days...maybe it’s just me, but it feels like 
you’ve been trying to distance yourself from me. And it’s really starting to worry me. I’m 
worried about you. So, if something’s been bothering you, you would talk about it with me, 
right...?” She watched Hotaru glance away. “I’m right...aren’t I? There is something 
bothering you...”</p><p>A pained look crossed Hotaru’s face.</p><p>“...It’s just... I don’t 
understand.”</p><p>Usagi felt Hotaru pull away from her, but she didn’t dare move. Hotaru 
suddenly looked very fragile and delicate, it was if she was about to break down into tears 
any second. In truth, it scared Usagi because Hotaru had always been the stronger of the 
two.</p><p>“What don’t you understand?” Usagi managed to whisper.</p><p>“...Is this... 
really real?” In the shadows of a moonless night, she felt a piece of herself drawn closer 
to the darkness she secretly harboured within herself. She had stood there at this one spot 
for many nights, wondering and worrying herself endlessly if she was living an illusion. 
“All of these years, I was neither dead nor alive. My consciousness persisted, but I didn’t 
have a physical body. It was...difficult. Even though I didn’t have a body, I still dreamed. 
Do you know what I saw...? All of the people that I killed that day, the people, that I was 
born to protect...I kept hearing their screams and cries for help, over and over again. And 
even now, I still hear them...”</p><p>Usagi felt a shiver run down her spine as those 
dark-eyes fell on her.</p><p>“You can’t hear their voices, can you?” She gestured towards 
the glowing city. Hotaru was trembling. “They’re still there...Some of them are still crying 
for help, but many more of them are angry.”</p><p>“Hotaru...”</p><p>Hotaru gulped. “Every 
night their voices seem to become louder. I’m...so scared! I know I don’t have the right to 
be happy, but...” She remembered spending time with the others over the past few 
days.</p><p>The beating heart that she felt within her chest attempted ease the nervousness 
that she felt, but even in dreams this warmth, she knew, could be disguised.</p><p>“It’s…Too 
perfect.” Hotaru whispered. She once again had the blonde’s undivided attention. “Don’t you 
understand? You know what I did... You know! But you just sit there and act like nothing has 
happened! ‘Glad to be home?’, ‘If you’re tired, you can go back to your room and rest’... 
Are you trying to make fun of me?!” She bit back a bitter chuckle; her body was torn between 
crying and laughing. “Why would my sister... the only family that I have left, hug me and 
want me back after everything I’ve done? Forgiveness isn’t that easy. It just isn’t. Setsuna 
wouldn’t have come looking for me either, if <i>that </i>didn’t happ--… heh…”</p><p>Hotaru 
hugged herself tightly, and felt her sanity threatening to slip away. “If you want revenge, 
then just get it over with.”</p><p><i>Stop playing with me. Chain me up, lock me away, or 
kill me again if need be. But not this… anything but this…</i></p><p>“...I’m a 
monster.”</p><p><i><b>Slap!</b></i></p><p>“Ah…” <i>What?</i> Hotaru gingerly touched the 
reddening mark on her face.</p><p>“Stop it. Stop this right now!” Usagi pleaded. Before 
Hotaru could protest, she was stunned into silence at what she saw. Her sister was standing 
there with her head down, body trembling and her fists shaking at her sides. She was 
furious; Hotaru had never witnessed Usagi like this before.</p><p>“Usagi…?” She dared to 
utter her name. It went largely unnoticed by her twin.</p><p>“What makes you think that I’m 
not hurt? What makes you think that none of us are hurting too?! Yes, I know what you did. I 
saw it all-- I was there! And this entire time, I’ve been asleep!” Her voice dipped to a low 
whisper. “…But what about you Hotaru? You’ve been awake this entire time, forced to linger 
with this guilt and pain. Isn’t that enough? Haven’t you...already suffered 
enough?”</p><p>“Usagi, I--” She was cut off by a sudden embrace.</p><p>“Maybe I did resent 
you a little at first when I woke up…” The whispery words touched Hotaru’s ear. This is the 
scorn that she had been waiting for all of these years and she now braced herself for it. 
Usagi felt Hotaru’s body stiffen.</p><p>“You disappeared, and took my world away… only to 
suddenly reappear to take <i>our</i> world away. You turned the sky dark, and painted the 
streets red. You ‘silenced’ those who cried for help, those that we swore to someday 
protect. And you even killed the one who gave birth to 
us.”</p><p>…<i>Mother…</i></p><p>“But… It isn’t your fault.”</p><p>Hotaru stared 
incredulously at her twin while the blonde woman pulled back slightly from the embrace. 
There were no tears in her blue eyes, only raw emotion—all which were absent of resentment 
or hatred; they were anything but what Hotaru had expected.</p><p>“But I--”</p><p>Usagi 
touched a finger to her lips and shook her head.</p><p>“It’s not your fault.” She repeated 
slowly. “This isn’t a dream Hotaru. I’m right here... I know we can’t bring the dead back to 
life, but… I’ve come to realize... that rather than having you disappear again, I would 
rather have my sister back. So... please don’t go away, please don’t ever leave me alone 
again.”</p><p>Hotaru let out a breath that she never knew she had been holding. It felt like 
a great burden was lifted from upon her shoulders-- her heart had never been lighter since 
the ill-fated night all of those centuries ago. While a part of her wanted to push Usagi 
away and accuse it all of being a trick of her mind, another piece of her spoke out; her 
sister hadn’t merely brushed away the past as if it were nothing. Hotaru’s actions had been 
acknowledged, tried, and, for now, forgiven.</p><p><i>I want to believe in this more than 
anything…</i></p><p>“Shall we?” Usagi reached her hand out to her sister. “It’s a little 
cold outside, don’t you agree? Why don’t we go back inside?”</p><p>Hotaru hesitated only for 
a second, but then she shyly took her hand and they both went inside together. That night, 
the two of them shared a bed in peaceful slumber. In her sister’s comforting embrace, the 
voices outside suddenly didn’t seem so loud.</p><p>Outside of the glowing city, Setsuna 
continued to watch it with a contemplative look.</p>
