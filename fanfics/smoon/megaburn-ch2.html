<h1>Megatokyo Burning (part 2 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/megaburn-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>        Minagi sighed to herself softly, the blue haired woman brushing 
her long mane of hair back as she cleaned off the top of the bar with a 
rag. Arisugawa&#39;s Locket was bustling, her black haired co-bartender 
Mahoro helping her keep up with the rush, but something still felt badly 
off.

        &quot;It&#39;s a bit strange, not having Ryouko here with you,&quot; Arisugawa 
Juri noted. With a gracious smile the orange haired owner and manager 
accepted her standard glass of colored gingerale, then the tall woman 
turned to look out at the crowd thoughtfully.

        &quot;She and Ayeka had to go with Tenchi back to Jurai,&quot; Minagi 
shrugged, her simple bodysuit hugging her atractive body, &quot;especially 
with the Emperor&#39;s death.&quot;

        &quot;Hey,&quot; the black haired woman made her way through the crowd to 
give them both a smile. Despite her age there was energy in her step, a 
slight grin on her face. &quot;Do you think Tenchi will take the throne?&quot; 
Tendo Nabiki asked curiously, &quot;There&#39;s a betting pool of some of our 
more glactically aware customers.&quot;

        &quot;I&#39;m curious, too,&quot; Juri admitted.

        &quot;I think he will take the throne,&quot; Minagi said to them gravely, 
&quot;if only to help protect the Earth.&quot; At their confused glances she 
continued, &quot;Jurai&#39;s empire has continued to expand in this direction. 
We&#39;d be a target, eventually, for a try of conquest.&quot;

        &quot;Emphasis on try,&quot; Mahoro offered with a grin. Her long black 
hair was tied back, the maid&#39;s uniform she wore crisp and neat.

        &quot;Point,&quot; Minagi grinned. &quot;This probably would be the one planet 
they couldn&#39;t take,&quot; she became more serious, &quot;but it&#39;d cost you.&quot;

        Nabiki shook her head, a smile on her face. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she 
waved as she walked off, &quot;I&#39;d better go place my bet.&quot;

        Juri watched her walk away, for a moment her expression sad. She 
and many of her friends were immortals, or at least ageless. But many of 
them weren&#39;t, and as Nabiki aged in front of her she became more and 
more aware of her friend&#39;s mortality.

        &quot;I always wondered why Jurai citizens rarely leave their 
empire,&quot; Minagi said softly, &quot;but I think I understand.&quot; She gave Juri a 
slight smile, &quot;It&#39;s hard, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

        &quot;Sometimes,&quot; Juri agreed.

        &quot;Juri-sama!&quot; Excel tackled her from behind, the blonde haired 
girl wrapping her arms around Juri&#39;s neck and nearly sending the woman 
crashing to the ground.

        &quot;Sorry, Juri,&quot; Hyatt said faintly, the black haired girl weakly 
tugging Excel off Juri&#39;s back. Someone waved for an order and the two 
bolted off to serve.

        &quot;Then again, this place has lots of distractions,&quot; Juri noted 
with a wry smile. She looked through the crowd, frowning slightly when 
she saw a familiar figure standing there alone. &quot;Excuse me,&quot; she pushed 
off from the bar, making her way into the crowd.

        &quot;Stay out of trouble,&quot; Mahoro added before moving to serve 
another customer.

        &quot;Hello, can I get you something?&quot; the brown haired woman smiled 
at the ladies at the table. &quot;My name is May, and I&#39;ll be serving you 
tonight.&quot;

        Juri waited until May delived the diner&#39;s order before flaging 
her down to ask, &quot;I thought you had the day off?&quot;

        &quot;Well, yes,&quot; May frowned. &quot;It&#39;s complicated.&quot;

        Juri raised an eyebrow, &quot;Care to talk about it? I&#39;d be glad to 
help.&quot;

        May hesitated, then she smiled slightly. &quot;Thank you, yes,&quot; she 
said softly.

        They went over to the stairway, past the dance floor and the 
library, then up to the upper floor. The bedrooms were all occupied, but 
they went right on past those to a simple unmarked office. &quot;Would you 
like something to drink?&quot; Juri offered once May sat down, casually 
reaching for a wine bottle up on a shelf.

        &quot;I&#39;m a Cyberdoll,&quot; May reminded her, &quot;alcohol doesn&#39;t really 
effect me.&quot;

        &quot;Maybe,&quot; Juri agreed, &quot;but it sometimes helps to have something 
to do with one&#39;s hands.&quot; Instead of sitting behind her desk Juri took a 
seat in a chair by May&#39;s, &quot;What&#39;s wrong?&quot;

        May looked down, then up to meet Juri&#39;s compassionate eyes. 
&quot;It&#39;s Keiko,&quot; she admitted.

        &quot;I kind of guessed that,&quot; Juri agreed. Keiko and May had been 
together for nearly fifty years, and the intense dark haired young woman 
was nearing sixty. She sighed, &quot;Keiko hasn&#39;t visited the Locket for 
awhile now.&quot;

        &quot;It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t want to,&quot; May sighed, &quot;but her work 
as a cybernetics designer is keeping her so busy. Keiko and I were 
supposed to be having a date tonight, but her manager called needing her 
to help with the latest prototype.&quot;

        &quot;But you shouldn&#39;t have to come second to the job, May,&quot; Juri 
reminded her gently.

        May actually laughed softly at that, &quot;Normally, I&#39;m not.&quot; More 
gravely she continued, &quot;This project is top secret, she can&#39;t even tell 
me about it, and all the work has to be done on site.&quot;

        &quot;And with your girlfriend kidnapped by her job you didn&#39;t want 
to be alone,&quot; Juri said thoughtfully, &quot;so you came over here.&quot;

        &quot;Pretty much,&quot; May agreed.

        &quot;You can work down there if you want to,&quot; Juri said to her 
gently, &quot;if that makes you more comfortable.&quot; A smile, &quot;Or you can just 
hand out with us, enjoy your day off.&quot;

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; May smiled, the two walking down stairs together.

        They reached the bottom step when Juri felt a familiar presence. 
She looked up, a slight smile appearing on her face as she saw the black 
haired woman waiting at the bar. Juri gave May a smile, &quot;You mind if I 
go?&quot;

        May chuckled softly, &quot;Have fun.&quot;

        Juri made her way through the crowd, politely nudging people 
aside to reach her target. &quot;Setsuna,&quot; she smiled, and was welcomed with 
a broad smile.

        &quot;Juri,&quot; Setsuna smiled back, her black hair shining an odd green 
in the light. They simply slid into each other&#39;s arms, both seeming to 
relax for the first time.

        &quot;Told you she&#39;d be back,&quot; Mahoro smiled, wiping the counter.

        &quot;Sorry to keep you waiting, love,&quot; Juri sighed happily. They 
slid apart most reluctantly, Minagi quickly producing Setsuna&#39;s favorite 
drink.

        &quot;Thank you,&quot; Setsuna smiled at Minagi, taking a cautious drink. 
She looked weary, her eyes dark as she leaned up against the bar.

        &quot;Rough day?&quot; Juri asked gently as Mahoro handed Juri her usual.

        Setsuna sighed, &quot;I&#39;m working on building the Senshi&#39;s new 
identities, alongside the computer expertise of our Professor Mizuno.&quot;

        &quot;You&#39;ve decided to go through with it?&#39; Mahoro blinked at her in 
surprise.

        &quot;There seems to be little choice,&quot; Setsuna made a face. &quot;None of 
us are aging, and makeup can only disguise that for so long.&quot;

        &quot;It can&#39;t be easy for some of them,&quot; Juri noted softly. Usagi 
Tsukino had built a career as a manga artist, Ami Mizuno was a professor 
at Tokyo university, Minako Aino was a well known idol, and so on. 
Abandoning those lives would be difficult, to say the least.

        &quot;No, it&#39;s not,&quot; Setsuna agreed. She took a small sip of her 
drink before softly continuing, &quot;Have you and the other duelists 
considered doing something similar?&quot;

        &quot;Touga&#39;s already working on something like that,&quot; Juri sighed. 
She swirled color gingerale around her own glass, &quot;I won&#39;t be seperated 
from you, Setsuna.&quot;

        &quot;Nor I, you,&quot; Setsuna said firmly. She took Juri&#39;s hand in her 
own, the matching gold rings they wore glistening in the bar&#39;s dim 
light, &quot;We&#39;ll find a way.&quot;

        Juri kissed her gently, &quot;Yes, we will.&quot;
