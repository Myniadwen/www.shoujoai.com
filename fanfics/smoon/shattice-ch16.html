<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch15.html">Back to Part 15</a><pre>&quot;The school is surprisingly busy this morning,&quot; Ami
Mizuno noted, the blue haired girl carrying her school
bad over her shoulder.

As the four of them neared the courtyard they saw that
the place was packed, nearly wall to wall students.
Despite it being early, there were not only the
regular students but apparently kids from other
schools were mingling with the crowds gathering there.

&quot;Negaverse trouble?&quot; Haruka raised an eyebrow, the
slim sandy haired woman looking ready to move at a
moment&#39;s notice. Beside her Michiru echoed her lover&#39;s
stance, eyes narrowed as she studied the scene around
her.

&quot;No, I don&#39;t think so,&quot; Setsuna actually looked amused
at that, the raven haired woman looking around her
with amusement. &quot;From what I understand, three new
transfer students are arriving here today,&quot; she
explained.

&quot;Three students could cause this much of a stir?&quot; Ami
blinked.

&quot;They can if they&#39;re the idol group called the Three
Lights,&quot; Setsuna shrugged casually.

&quot;Ah ha,&quot; Michiru nodded sagely, &quot;I heard Hotaru
listening to one of their songs, apparently they&#39;re
very popular.&quot;

&quot;Idols,&quot; Haruka sniffed disdainfully.

The four of them made their way through the crowds
just as a van pulled up, decorated with a stylized
emblem of three shooting stars. The crowd held it&#39;s
breath as the door opened only to release it as a
squeal of happiness as the three figures emerged in
customized school uniforms. The tallest had reddish
brown hair and moved with an dignified air, the next
had black hair and a devilish smile while the third
carried a boyish innocence along with hair that was
white as the driven snow.

Ami&#39;s eyes widened as she recognized the odd young man
she had met only a few days ago, &quot;Guess he really was
famous.&quot;

Seiya Kou looked up, his long black ponytail flowing
and grinned as he recognized Ami. &quot;Hey Mizuno,&quot; he
waved to her casually, &quot;good to see you!&quot;

Ami instantly felt many eyes resting on her, the crowd
clearly wondering how Ami knew the popular idol.
Silently wishing she had not been put on the spot Ami
gave the three young men a wave, &quot;I look forward to
being classes with you.&quot;

&quot;See you,&quot; Seiya waved back as he and the others were
quickly ushered into the school and away from their
adoring fans.

&quot;That&#39;s the odd young man you met at school the other
day?&quot; Setsuna asked.

Ami shrugged, &quot;How was I to know he was really as
famous as he claimed?&quot;

&quot;We can&#39;t leave you alone for a second,&quot; Haruka
sounded amused.

&quot;That young man seems to like you,&quot; Michiru teased.

&quot;Even so,&quot; Ami reached out to take Setsuna&#39;s hand,
&quot;I&#39;m not interested.&quot;

Setsuna squeezed Ami&#39;s hand as she murmured, &quot;Thanks.&quot;

Not long afterward Ami was sitting in class, watching
with mild amusement as the teacher stood up front with
the members of the Three Lights. The teen idols were
casually basking in much of the class&#39;s adoration even
as the teacher hesitantly introduced them, &quot;This is
Seiya, Taiki and Yaten Kou, they&#39;ll be attending
classes with us until the end of the year.&quot; He paused,
&quot;Gentlemen, you may take whichever seats are
available.&quot;

Immediately several girls popped up, waving towards
empty seats by them but the three moved smoothly,
taking three seats relatively close together... and
near where Ami was sitting. Casually Seiya settled
into the seat behind Ami as he murmured, &quot;Hope you
don&#39;t mind.&quot;

Ami dryly answered, &quot;I&#39;ll manage.&quot;

Yaten flashed a surprisingly cheerful smile, &quot;You&#39;re
right Seiya, she really is unimpressed by us.&quot; He
paused, &quot;I think I like it.&quot;

&quot;Please don&#39;t tease Miss Mizuno,&quot; Taiki scolded his
brothers good naturedly.

Ami found herself smiling slightly, unwillingly
charmed by the three young men&#39;s antics. &quot;We have a
class, remember?&quot; she asked, keeping her voice down.

A few moments later Seiya softly whispered, &quot;Would you
mind showing us around the school later on?&quot;

&quot;Why me?&quot; Ami asked, keeping half her attention on the
teacher.

&quot;Because if we ask one of our many fangirls,&quot; Seiya
said to her wryly, &quot;I don&#39;t want to think about what
would happen.&quot;

&quot;Miss Mizuno.&quot; the teacher interrupted, &quot;would you
mind translating this passage?&quot; Despite only having
been half listening Ami rose, smoothly translating the
passage from Japanese to English, while also noting
the words that had multiple connotations. The look on
his face was priceless, clearing his throat before
muttering, &quot;Ah, yes. Good job.&quot;

&quot;Very nice,&quot; Taiki whispered with a smile.

Once class let out Ami found herself with three
companions, the brothers looking around eagerly.
Dressed in her own boy&#39;s uniform they almost looked
like some kind of odd gang, if a remarkably good
looking one.

&quot;All right, I&#39;ll show you around,&quot; Ami finally gave in
to their half joking pleas, &quot;but I warn you, it&#39;ll be
my interests first.&quot;

With that Ami took them to the computer lab, the well
stocked library and over to the science labs, Taiki
looking on with interest and Seiya and Yaten looking
dismayed, Only then did she relent to take them by the
gym, where a very interesting game of five on one was
being played.

The sandy haired figure dodged and weaved through the
guards with ridiculous ease, running at the hoop. A
thrust of powerful legs threw her up into the air, the
basketball leaving her hands in a graceful arc then
with a swish it went in!

&quot;Hey, Ami,&quot; Haruka toweled herself off as she walked
from the court, Michiru soon coming from the sidelines
to join her side. She raised her eyebrows as Ami&#39;s
companions and asked, &quot;Making some new friends?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sort of an involuntary tour guide,&quot; Ami said,
flashing a smile to ease the sting of her words.
&quot;Seiya, Taiki, Yaten I&#39;d like you to meet my friends
Haruka and Michiru.&quot;

&quot;Nice to meet you,&quot; Seiya offered his hand. Haruka
took it and squeezed down hard, Seiya matching her
pressure for pressure. For a moment they stood there,
some dangerous spark passing between the two of them,
an invisible clash of wills.

&quot;I believe I heard the two of you playing a duet
recently,&quot; Taiki offered gentlemanly to Michiru, &quot;it
was very beautiful.&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Michiru murmured.

&quot;Would you care to join us?&quot; Ami offered.

Haruka looked towards the court where another group of
players were impatiently waiting. &quot;I think I better
take care of this, first,&quot; she remarked, &quot;you still
joining Setsuna for lunch?&quot;

&quot;Of course,&quot; Ami laughed, leading the young men away.

&quot;What was that between you and Ami&#39;s friend?&quot; Taiki
asked Seiya softly.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure,&quot; Seiya conceded, &quot;but I think we&#39;re not
going to get along well.&quot;

&quot;Maybe she just doesn&#39;t like men,&quot; Yaten offered.

Ami had to fight back a smile at that comment, &#39;You
have no idea.&#39; Noting all of the Three Lights fangirls
that had been trailing them so far she added, &quot;You
know, I don&#39;t think I realized quite how popular you
are.&quot; As Seiya brightened a bit she added, &quot;Of course,
since I don&#39;t listen to popular music I wouldn&#39;t
know.&quot;

Both Taiki and Yaten laughed softly at that even as
Seiya winced, &quot;Mizuno, you&#39;re going to do permanent
damage to my ego.&quot; He casually looked over at Ami, &quot;Do
you have a boyfriend?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Ami said, mildly surprised.

&quot;Good,&quot; Seiya smiled slightly, &quot;then I have a chance.&quot;

&quot;But I do have a girlfriend,&quot; Ami added firmly.</pre>
