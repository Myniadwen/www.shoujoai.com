<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<pre>&quot;I still think I should have been a vampire,&quot; Minako
Aino complained good naturedly as the adjusted her red
blouse. Tight black leather pants hugged her legs,
tucked into matching boots while her cutlass thumped
against her side and a black eyepatch completed the
pirate look.

&quot;Problem is, blonde hair doesn&#39;t really suit the whole
vampire look,&quot; Rei Hino said patiently as she slid the
cape over Minako&#39;s shoulders, &quot;you&#39;d have to dye it.&quot;

&quot;Never,&quot; Minako reached up to stroke her hair
protectively.

&quot;There you go,&quot; the faintly blushing Rei shrugged,
tugging up the zipper of her own costume a bit
uncomfortably.

&quot;Uhm,&quot; Minako looked at her with a impish smile, &quot;who
are you dressed as again?&quot;

&quot;Nancy Makuhari,&quot; Rei sighed, looking down at the
leather bodysuit she was wearing. The material clung
to her body like she had been poured into it, while
the zipper down the front had a distressing tendency
to slip down.

&quot;Usagi talked you into it, didn&#39;t she?&quot; Minako guessed
with surprising accuracy.

Rei wiggled a bit uncomfortably in the costume,
feeling faintly annoyed that she could only get away
with wearing... minimal underwear. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she quietly
agreed, &quot;though I&#39;d love to know where she got this
outfit from.&quot;

&quot;Usagi is a woman of surprising resourcefulness,&quot;
Minako said cheerfully. She smiled as they left the
back room of the shrine, &quot;I mean, if you had told me a
few years back that she&#39;s be working in a manga studio
I wouldn&#39;t have believed it.&quot;

&quot;You aren&#39;t doing so bad yourself as a voice actress
and singer,&quot; Rei pointed out.

Minako smiled slightly as they walked into the common
room. &quot;How are you doing,&quot; she asked softly, &quot;running
the shrine without your grandfather?&quot;

&quot;Surprisingly well, actually,&quot; Rei said as she walked
around the decorated room, adjusting black and orange
drapes and checking on the bowl of red punch, &quot;the
people of the area were used to me assisting grandpa,
so my taking over wasn&#39;t an issue.&quot; She hesitated,
stopping by one of the bowls of candy, &quot;I miss him,
though.&quot;

Minako reached out to rest her hand on her friend&#39;s
shoulder, offering silent comfort. They stood there
for a moment, then the sounds of people coming from
out on the walkway finally caused them to move apart.

&quot;Trick or treat!&quot; the kids chorused as Rei opened the
door, dumping candy in each of their bags. The little
witches, goblins and ghosts thanked her and were off,
nearly running into the group of three young women
walking up the path.

Ami Mizuno walked confidently, her brown cloak flowing
over a armored breastplate, a short sword belted at
her side. Beside her Makoto Kino looked faintly amused
in her white wedding gown, the dress flowing over her
long, athletic form. But Rei&#39;s eyes were drawn to
Usagi Tsukino, the slim blonde almost radiant in her
Red Ranger uniform, the glossy red and gold fabric
clinging to her body from the neck down.

Rei felt Minako&#39;s sympathetic gaze resting on her and
forced herself to breathe deep, trying her best to
banish the faint red from her cheeks. &quot;Good to see
you,&quot; she laughed as she stepped aside to let them
inside.

&quot;Nice outfit,&quot; Makoto complimented her as she picked
up the hem of her dress to go up the wooden steps.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Rei said with as much dignity as she
could muster.

&quot;Are Haruka and the others here, yet?&quot; Ami asked as
she walked in, nodding her greetings to both Rei and
Minako.

&quot;Hotaru and I talked earlier,&quot; Minako offered the
information, &quot;she said they&#39;d try to be here as soon
as they could.&quot;

Usagi smiled as she looked up at the slightly taller
Rei, her blue eyes twinkling, &quot;I&#39;m glad you wore the
costume I sent you.&quot;

Rei smiled back, trying not to look at how the costume
hugged Usagi&#39;s body. &quot;It&#39;s bit more than I&#39;d normally
wear,&quot; she admitted, &quot;but I think I like it.&quot;

&quot;It suits you,&quot; Usagi murmured.

Minako looked outside curiously, &quot;Is Mamoru coming?&quot;

Usagi shook her head, &quot;No, he&#39;s away for business.&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Minako said sheepishly.

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Usagi smiled cheerfully, &quot;it just
means that tonight will be girls only.&quot;

Rei could feel her face shutting down at the mention
of his name, but she couldn&#39;t seem to help it. She had
thought that time would help her get used to them
being together, but it had never happened... she still
felt that familiar stab of pain when she heard that
name. Once she had thought that it was just a left
over pain from her own relationship with him, but
eventually she had realized it was something else.

The knocking of more children at the door distracted
Rei nicely, and with a more relaxed smile she
complimented all the cute costumes. Up the walk came
four more figures and she called out jokingly, &quot;It&#39;s
about time you got here.&quot;

&quot;Haruka couldn&#39;t decide which suit to wear,&quot; Michiru
said, her elegant dress making the green haired woman
look like something from another era.

Haruka shook her head, her 40&#39;s fedora shielding the
sandy blonde&#39;s face, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re going to pay for that
comment later, love.&quot;

&quot;I look forward to it,&quot; Michiru purred, patting her
lover&#39;s suit clad arm.

&quot;They never seem to quit,&quot; Hotaru complained good
naturedly, her black hair falling to her shoulders.
She wore a futuristic looking blue jumpsuit, a skill
and cross-bones patch on her shoulder and a ray-gun
strapped to her side.

&quot;Were you expecting them to?&quot; Minako asked as she
walked over to Hotaru&#39;s side, her eyes shining her
welcome.

&quot;Looks like we have two pirates tonight,&quot; Setsuna
noted, her black hair concealed by the cloak she wore,
her wizard&#39;s staff gently thumping the ground as she
walked.

Hotaru laughed, reaching out to take Minako&#39;s hand in
hers. &quot;But I know which of us is the pirate queen,&quot;
she murmured.

Haruka had to chuckle, seeing Minako blush so sweetly
like that. Rei had found herself wondering how she and
Michiru had taken the news that Minako and Hotaru had
become romantically involved, but so far it looked
like things had gone well.

Settling into chairs the group of ladies quickly
caught each other up on what was going on with their
lives even as they had snacks. Makoto was well
established as a chef in Tokyo, Ami was working as a
physician at the same hospital her mother had and
Setsuna was working as head nurse, Haruka was racing
full time, Michiru was alternating her painting and
violin and finally Hotaru was graduating from
university this year.

&quot;Of course we&#39;re all going to crash your graduation,&quot;
Makoto noted from where she sat by Ami, holding the
smaller woman&#39;s hand.

Hotaru laughed, &quot;That should be interesting. I&#39;m
already being teased by my classmates about my cute
girlfriend.&quot;

&quot;As long as you don&#39;t get caught in the dorm with
Minako,&quot; Haruka said firmly.

&quot;Like you can talk,&quot; Michiru teased.

Setsuna laughed, &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to know.

All of them taking turns giving the candy to the kids
they simply spent the evening enjoying the pleasure of
their company, telling tales and having fun. Rei was a
bit surprised at how Usagi spent so much time with
her, sitting by her on the couch and sharing a plate
of snacks.

Finally with a great deal of reluctance they began to
head back home, many of them having to work the next
day. Rei bid each one farewell even as they vowed to
get together soon, then she was finally alone with
Usagi. Turning Rei was surprised to see the blonde
standing so close and she asked questioningly,
&quot;Usagi...?&quot;

&quot;Shh,&quot; Usagi gently shushed her. The red clad girl
stepped closer and kissed her, shocking Rei into
stiffness.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot; Rei asked softly.

Usagi smiled, &quot;If you don&#39;t know, you&#39;re even more
innocent than I thought.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Rei&#39;s cheeks flamed, &quot;but I thought.... what
about Mamoru?&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s Halloween,&quot; Usagi murmured, &quot;just for tonight I
don&#39;t have to be a princess bound by destiny, and you
don&#39;t have to be the loyal soldier.&quot; She met Rei&#39;s
eyes as she let a finger linger on the zipper of Rei&#39;s
jumpsuit, &quot;Please?&quot;

Rei felt her heart beat faster, gazing into those blue
eyes. Despite her words she knew that this couldn&#39;t be
just one night, that if they started this it wouldn&#39;t
stop. Still, she suddenly found her self not caring
about it at all. She bent her head to kiss Usagi,
throwing caution to the winds.

&quot;I love you,&quot; Rei confessed softly, &quot;I always have.&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; Usagi answered, &quot;I have, too.&quot; And with
that, she firmly pulled the zipper down, revealing the
creamy white flesh.

Rei felt her breath catch at the boldness, a blush
staining her cheeks as it was quickly revealed that
she wasn&#39;t wearing a bra. She gasped as Usagi bent to
place a delicate kiss at the base of her throat, then
down towards the curve of her breasts. Delicate hands
grasped the top of the jumpsuit and tugged, her
breasts slipping free from the leather.

Usagi smiled happily as she saw those pert breasts,
the nipples rock hard with excitement and the chill
air. She swiftly caught a nipple in her mouth,
delighting in the taste and texture of Rei&#39;s breasts,
her hands gently stroking the breasts as Rei gently
wrapped her hands around her head.

&quot;Oh kami,&quot; Rei moaned, &quot;my knees are getting weak.&quot;

Together they slid to the floor, Usagi firmly
maneuvering Rei onto her back, her glossy red clothes
covering her body light a sheath. With wild abandon
she alternated from one breast to another, worshipping
the firm flesh ever as Rei moaned beneath her.

Gently Rei tugged her mouth free then drew her up into
another kiss, her eyes shining as they pressed smudged
lips together. She let her arms trail down Usagi&#39;s
back as she found the zipper, unzipping the other
woman&#39;s costume quickly. Rei gasped as the top came
free, revealing that Usagi had also not worn a bra
beneath her costume.

&quot;Let me,&quot; Rei eagerly started for those breasts but
Usagi stopped her gently.

&quot;No,&quot; she shook her head then Usagi smiled, &quot;I&#39;ve
dreamed of doing something like this for a long time.
Let me, please.&quot;

Rei shuddered as Usagi slid her hands down to her
hips, then tugged at the tight black cloth that hugged
Rei&#39;s skin so boldly. Understanding what she wanted
Rei lifted her hips as they swiftly divested her of
the rest of the jumpsuit, soon leaving her laying
there in only her thong.

Gently, almost reverently she stroked down Rei&#39;s
belly, touching the top of the daring piece of fabric
then slipping her fingers into the waistband. She
pulled firmly, the cloth sticking to wet flesh as the
sweet scent wafted up to her. Usagi blinked as she saw
the shaven flesh, the looked up to see Rei&#39;s faintly
blushing face.

&quot;I started shaving because of swimming,&quot; Rei murmured
sheepishly, &quot;and it was more comfortable just to...&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re lovely,&quot; Usagi smiled reassuringly, then she
bent forward to plant a delicate kiss on those rose
colored petals.

Rei shuddered under that touch, her legs gently
pressed aside by Usagi&#39;s hands, her blonde hair
falling around her face. The sensations started gently
as Usagi used her tongue to part her flesh, then
spreading with her fingers to drink deep. Wetness grew
as Rei moaned, soon tossing her head as the pleasure
soared through her body, a sweet agony.

&quot;Please Usagi,&quot; Rei mewled, her back arching as she
pressed herself wildly against Usagi&#39;s surprisingly
talented lips.

With a smile of sweet satisfaction Rei flicked her
tongue back ad forth across Rei&#39;s clit, the massive
burst of stimulation sending the other girl crashing
into orgasm. Sliding up Rei&#39;s sweat slick body she
cradled Rei close, holding her till the last shudders
had died away. &quot;Are you all right?&quot; Usagi asked,
stroking her hair in a absent minded sort of way.

&quot;I will be,&quot; Rei managed after a moment. A scattered
thought managed to worm it&#39;s way to the surface of her
mid, &quot;Ah.. you&#39;ve done this before?&quot;

Usagi stopped her stroking a moment, then continued as
she softly conceded, &quot;Yes.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Rei answered. In all honestly it
bothered her a little, but she knew that she didn&#39;t
own Usagi... and there was no way this was going to
continue if she acted like she did. She smiled
slightly and asked, &quot;Do I know who it was?&quot;

&quot;Haruka,&quot; Usagi admitted, a blush coloring her cheeks.

&quot;But wouldn&#39;t Michiru have objected?&quot; Rei asked,
sitting up tiredly, feeling some of her energy coming
back.

Usagi&#39;s blush got even brighter, if possible, as she
confessed, &quot;Michiru was there.&quot;

Rei blinked, realizing that explained a lot about why
Michiru let Haruka get away with flirting so much. She
was about to say something when she noticed how wide
Usagi&#39;s eyes were, her breath still coming a little
fast. Leaning forward she pressed her lips to Usagi&#39;s
tasting her essence on them as she softly murmured,
&quot;You took care of me.. can I take a turn?&quot;

&quot;Please!&quot; Usagi blurted.

Nibbling on Usagi&#39;s neck Rei helped strip her from her
own tight pants, her breath coming faster as she saw
that Usagi had skipped panties entirely, her white
gold triangle matted by her glistening fluids. Rei
surprised her by sliding her body up, gently spreading
Usagi&#39;s legs even as she slid her own between them.

Rei smiled as Usagi bit back a moan as their slick
flesh slid against each other, then with a gentle
turning of her hips she began to grind then together.
Usagi was already so primed she was moaning in
moments, tossing her lovely blonde hair, eyes wide
with passion. &quot;It feels so good,&quot; she squealed,
bucking for closer contact.

&quot;We&#39;ve just started,&quot; Rei hissed, grasping Usagi by
her bottom as they ground together, already feeling
another orgasm on the way.

&quot;Aaah!&quot; Usagi cried out in pleasure, hips wildly
jerking against Rei&#39;s before she lay still, breath
coming in soft gasps. Rei pulled back a bit then knelt
between Usagi&#39;s limp legs, spreading them gently.
&quot;What are you...?&quot; Usagi managed weakly.

&quot;I told you,&quot; Rei knelt as she pressed her lips
between Usagi&#39;s legs, &quot;we&#39;re just getting started.&quot;

End

Notes: Couples in this fic include Ami/Makoto,
Haruka/Michiru, Minako/Hotaru and of course Rei/Usagi.
I liked the idea of them getting together under these
circumstances, but I also couldn&#39;t see breaking up
Usagi/Mamoru, so they seem to be beginning a affair...
