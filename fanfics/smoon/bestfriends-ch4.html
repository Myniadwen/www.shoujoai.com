<h1>Best Friends (part 4 of 16)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/desslok.html">Desslok</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/bestfriends-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Ok, she&#39;ll meet you in front of the Crown Game Parlor at 6:00,&quot; 
Makoto said.  After &quot;Hello&quot; those had pretty much been the first 
words out of her mouth after Kenjo had answered the phone.

The young man checked his watch.  It was 4:30. &quot;That will work 
out great, Mako-chan.  Have I thanked you for doing this for me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but not enough,&quot; Makoto chided. &quot;Personally, I think the 
whole thing is silly.  She&#39;s clearly too beautiful for you and 
you&#39;re definitely too nice for her.  She seems to prefer 
dangerous boys, like pop singers.&quot;

Kenjo laughed, &quot;Just because I am not dangerous to _you_ doesn&#39;t 
mean I can&#39;t be dangerous when the situation demands it, and no 
one has ever booed me off of a karaoke stage.&quot;  Slowly, something 
she&#39;d said registered.  &quot;Hey, what do you mean she&#39;s too 
beautiful for me?&quot;  He grunted in mock disgust.

&quot;All I am saying is that you are not used to being with someone 
as beautiful as her.  You&#39;ll have to get used to the fact that 
boys stare at her all the time,&quot; Makoto warned.

&quot;But Mako-chan,&quot; he replied in a sickeningly sweet tone, &quot;I am 
used to that from hanging out with you.&quot;

Makoto snorted skeptically.

&quot;Besides,&quot; Kenjo continued, &quot;didn&#39;t I hear you say the other day 
that you preferred brunettes to blondes?&quot;

&quot;Well, that doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t know which of my friends 
are beautiful, Kenjo-chan.  In fact, they are all beautiful in 
their own way.  Usagi is the sweetest girl you could ever hope to 
meet; her joy and kindness radiate in her features.  Rei is 
exotic and mysterious while Minako has a more classical beauty.  
And Ami...&quot;

Kenjo tuned in carefully for this.  As Makoto&#39;s pause lengthened, 
he smiled to himself and added it to his internal compilation of 
evidence.  

&quot;Ami,&quot; Makoto eventually continued, &quot;is just incredible.  Her 
hair glows, her eyes sparkle, and her skin is so fair that you&#39;d 
think she was made of porcelain. I wish I was half as beautiful 
as she is.&quot;  

Kenjo heard her sigh and could just imagine the look on her face 
right now.  It was probably the same one she used to get whenever 
she&#39;d see someone who reminded her of her ex. &quot;I&#39;m sure she 
thinks the same thing about you, you know,&quot; he suggested gently.  

A harsh laugh indicated that she thought nothing of the sort and 
that, despite his caution, he&#39;d broken the spell.  Kenjo decided 
he&#39;d best change the subject.  

&quot;So, how was the rest of your dinner?&quot; he asked.

&quot;It was fun,&quot; Makoto replied tentatively.  

Kenjo picked up on her uncertainty immediately. &quot;I&#39;m glad you had 
fun.  What did you guys talk about?&quot;

&quot;Oh you know, girl stuff.  Mostly we listened to Usagi pine for 
Mamoru,&quot; Makoto laughed.  More seriously, she added, &quot;Rei was 
pretty quiet.  I don&#39;t think she and Usagi fought once.  It was 
like she was watching me, or Ami, or something.&quot;

At the moment, Kenjo really didn&#39;t care what might be going on 
with Hino Rei.  &quot;How&#39;s Ami?&quot; he asked, trying to sound 
nonchalant.

Kenjo could hear Makoto&#39;s fond smile through the receiver. 
&quot;Quiet, as usual.  She made me laugh a few times, though.  She 
says the funniest things sometimes, but usually quietly enough so 
that only I hear.&quot;  Makoto paused. &quot;She did perk up at one point, 
though, right after I asked Minako if she&#39;d go out on a date with 
you.  You should have seen her smile.  Rei too, come to think of 
it.  I guess they were both afraid I&#39;d ask them to date you,&quot; 
Makoto teased.

&quot;I&#39;m not sure I like the sound of that!&quot; Kenjo complained. He 
made a mental note to try to figure out what that all meant 
later.  

&quot;Well, if it makes you feel any better, Usagi complained that no 
one ever tried to set her up with their cute boy friends.  Minako 
reminded her about Mamoru, though, and that brought up another 
round of pining.&quot;  

Kenjo laughed. &quot;Sounds like you guys had a good time.  So, 6:00 
huh? Well, as much as I love talking with you, I need to start 
getting ready for this date.&quot;

&quot;You never really explained to me why all of a sudden you wanted 
to have dinner with Minako,&quot; Makoto pointed out. &quot;I think you owe 
me that much.&quot;

&quot;I promise, I&#39;ll explain it all to you on Saturday. You take care 
and I promise to give you all the dirt then,&quot; Kenjo assured her. 
&quot;Oh, one last thing!  When you asked her at dinner last night, 
I&#39;m sure that she had some questions about me.  Is there anything 
I should know going in, as far as what she&#39;s expecting?&quot;

&quot;Oh no, Captain Mysterious.  You want to keep your secrets till 
Saturday?  Well, then so do I.&quot; Makoto chuckled wickedly.  In a 
more serious tone she added, &quot;Just be yourself, Kenjo-chan, and 
all will be well.  She&#39;s a sweet girl and you&#39;re a great guy.&quot;

&quot;Thanks,&quot; Kenjo replied a bit nervously, &quot;I&#39;ll talk to you 
later.&quot;

&quot;See ya!&quot; Makoto replied before disconnecting.

As he hung up the phone and started to lay out some clothes for 
dinner, Kenjo reflected on the conversation, and also the one 
from Monday.  He really didn&#39;t doubt now that Makoto was in love 
with Mizuno Ami.  Though she tried very hard to hide behind her 
various walls, he knew all the secret gateways; there was no way 
she could hide something like that from him.   The question then 
was, had she hidden it from herself.  He knew that while his 
friend had a very strong sense of self, she still had areas of 
great insecurity.  The most glaring of these was her complete 
inability to believe that someone could love her.  Despite how 
she talked about her friends, he knew that a part of her still 
had lingering doubts about her importance to them.  It had taken 
him years to really convince her that he loved her for who she 
was, not some false image, not someone he wanted to bed, just as 
Kino Makoto.  

Of course, the second big question was, did Ami return those 
feelings.  Hopefully, dinner tonight would shed some light on 
that question.  He really had no objection to going out on a date 
with someone like Aino Minako.  He&#39;d met her a couple times and 
could still vividly recall each occasion.  He hoped that Mako 
wasn&#39;t right, that Minako wasn&#39;t too beautiful for him.  &#39;All 
guys should have such a problem,&#39; he reflected. That beauty, plus 
her obviously kind nature, certainly made tonight&#39;s &#39;mission&#39; a 
very manageable burden.  Still, he was a bit surprised at how 
nervous he suddenly felt.

Kenjo sighed and moved into the bathroom for a quick shower and 
shave.  Even if Ami returned Makoto&#39;s feelings, it would take 
something pretty serious to help Makoto see that.  From the 
little Kenjo knew about Ami, he didn&#39;t think she was the type to 
come on that strong.  In fact, she appeared to be quite similar 
to Makoto in that sense:  very reserved in dealing with others, 
very private, very careful.  

Standing there, gazing at himself in the mirror, he recalled all 
the times that Makoto had been there for him: nursing him through 
a fever when his parents were out of town; offering a shoulder 
when his heart had been broken for the first time, then the 
second, and the third; knowing instinctively how worried he&#39;d 
been about moving to Kyoto and saying all the right things to 
help him adjust to the idea.  If there was anything he could do 
to make her happy, to help her find someone else who could be 
everything he tried to be for her and more, then there was no way 
in hell he would fail to do it.  With a firm nod of his head, he 
commenced with his preparations.   

----------------------------------

A moment frozen in time, complete with soundtrack.  Kenjo stood 
at the designated spot.  He&#39;d just glanced down at his watch.  It 
was 6:02 pm.  Looking up, the moment.  

The image hit him first, of course, but the song came unbidden 
soon after from an old Fred Astaire movie he&#39;d seen at school.

Someday . . . when I&#39;m awfully low
when the world is cold
I will feel a glow just thinking of you
and the way you look tonight
 
From bottom to top: knee-high black leather boots; white tights; 
a woolen skirt, plaid but predominantly red; layered blouses, red 
silk over lacy white-cotton, with a red sweater draped over for 
warmth; blonde hair hanging down, kept back with a red band 
trimmed in gold.  Draped over one shoulder, a black suede Chanel 
bag, the interlocking Cs and gold-chain strap brought back sudden 
memories of hours spent trying to master the &quot;Love-Me-Chain&quot; and 
&quot;Venus Crescent Beam&quot; attacks in the latest Sailor V videogame.  

&#39;Mako was right, she is much too beautiful for me, or anyone,&#39; he 
pondered briefly, before re-engaging conscious thought processes.

&quot;Shinozaki-san,&quot; Minako called, smiling at his reaction.  
Clearly, the outfit was a success.  &quot;I hope you weren&#39;t waiting 
long.&quot;

To his credit, Kenjo regrouped quickly. &quot;Not at all, and, please, 
no need for such formality.  I&#39;ve heard so much about you, I feel 
I already know you.&quot;  Kenjo bowed and began to walk down the 
street.

Minako laughed lightly, &quot;Very well, Kenjo-kun.  I hope you 
haven&#39;t believed everything you&#39;ve heard.&quot;  She fell into step 
beside him.

&quot;Only the good things, Minako-san,&quot; he replied, darting a wry 
glance her way. &quot;Thanks for coming.&quot;

&quot;Makoto mentioned something about rakish charm,&quot; Minako teased. 
&quot;I see she was not too far off.  Given that, how could I resist?  
So, where are we headed?&quot;

&quot;Well, there is a new place that opened a few months ago.  I&#39;ve 
never been there, but Mako-chan assures me it is excellent.  
Mostly French cuisine, with some other European stuff as well.&quot;

Minako noted the &#39;Mako-chan.&#39; She&#39;d known that Kenjo and Makoto 
were close and thus, was not really surprised.  Still, his use of 
it seemed to indicate that he wanted her to know about that 
closeness.  Minako knew a lot about dating (being the Senshi of 
Love had its advantages, after all), and one thing she knew was 
that most guys had an agenda when they went on a date.  Usually, 
the agenda was depressingly predictable.  So far, so good, on 
that count, but it was early yet.  She really hoped she wouldn&#39;t 
have to slap Makoto&#39;s friend, but would if necessary.  

&quot;Sounds lovely,&quot; she said aloud. &quot;Can I ask you why you wanted to 
take me to dinner?  I know we&#39;ve met a couple times, but to hear 
Mako-chan tell it, you&#39;ve been resisting her attempts to set us 
up for a long time now.&quot;  She peeked over to gauge his reaction 
to her comment.

Kenjo looked around conspiratorially and then leaned closer. &quot;Can 
you keep a secret?&quot; he whispered.

Intrigued, Minako nodded.

&quot;Well, I have an agenda, with multiple layers,&quot; he began. &quot;Most 
importantly, and the reason for doing this tonight instead of 
some other time, is that I needed to talk to one of Mako-chan&#39;s 
close friends.&quot;

Minako&#39;s eyes narrowed as she glared at Kenjo. &quot;Why would you 
need to do that?&quot;  Suddenly, an idea occurred. &quot;She&#39;s not in any 
sort of trouble, is she?&quot;  Anxiety replaced suspicion in her blue 
eyes.

&quot;No, no, nothing to be worried about and nothing bad either, I 
promise you,&quot; Kenjo reassured her.  &quot;It&#39;s a little complicated, 
but I will explain completely, later.&quot;

&quot;So, is that all I am to you, an information source?&quot; Minako 
asked in an overly-dramatic aggrieved tone.

Kenjo laughed, &quot;I think not.  Like I said, multiple layers.  
Mako-chan comes first, but I am neither stupid nor dead.  Taking 
an interesting, beautiful young woman to dinner is certainly no 
chore.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm.&quot;  Minako considered his response. &quot;I suppose that is a 
decent enough save, but I really am not used to being someone&#39;s 
secondary consideration on a date.&quot;  Again, she feigned annoyance 
that she didn&#39;t really feel.  In some regards, it was a relief to 
be out on a date where the focus was not on her, her, her.  It 
certainly took the pressure off of living up to unrealistic 
expectations.

Kenjo stopped and turned to face Minako.  She was startled by how 
serious and earnest he looked.  &quot;I am sorry, Minako-san. I really 
do not want you to think that you are secondary in any way.  I 
have heard so much about you and, for a long time, I&#39;d been 
trying to get up the nerve to let Mako-chan &#39;set us up&#39;.  It&#39;s 
just that, I&#39;m only home for a week and there are some things I 
have to do before I go back to school.  For her.  I thought I 
could &#39;kill two birds in the same bush&#39;, as they say, but that is 
probably not very fair to you.&quot; 

Minako cocked her head to one side and considered this odd young 
man before her.  He really was not unattractive at all.  Dark 
hair and dark eyes set off by a black button-down shirt and gray 
slacks; he was certainly her type.  Searching his expression, she 
could see the concern in his eyes.  He really did have something 
he needed to discuss regarding Makoto, but right now, he was 
mostly afraid that he&#39;d offended her.  A warmth began to overtake 
her and she could almost feel herself blushing.  

&quot;I think the expression is &#39;two birds with one stone&#39;,&quot; she 
gently replied.  

Kenjo chuckled, still uncertain.  &quot;Sorry, I&#39;m really not very 
good with proverbs.&quot;

A sudden burst of light shone in her eyes and spread through her 
whole visage.  &quot;Hey! That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever gotten to 
correct someone about something like that!&quot;  She touched him 
gently on the shoulder.  &quot;I think I like it the way you said it 
better anyway.  That&#39;s the problem with proverbs.  Whenever you 
try to improve them, someone comes down on you for getting it 
wrong!&quot;  Minako smiled, to let him know everything was fine, and 
began to walk again, slowly so he could catch up.

For a moment, Kenjo simply stood there watching her.  When he&#39;d 
realized how mercenary he had been in setting up this date, he&#39;d 
felt simply horrible.  Yes, there was little he would not do for 
Makoto, but he had been so focused on her that he&#39;d failed to 
consider how Minako might feel about it.  The direct way in which 
she&#39;d expressed her concern, and the ease with which she&#39;d 
accepted his apology and moved on, made his heart race for some 
reason.  &#39;She truly is beautiful,&#39; he considered, without one 
thought of her appearance.  Dragging himself from his reverie, he 
hustled to catch up to her.

For the rest of the walk to the restaurant and over dinner, 
Minako and Kenjo spoke not at all about Makoto, or any of the 
other senshi.  They discussed schoolwork (both did it, neither 
liked it much) and life at college (they both loved it, except 
for the schoolwork).  She asked about life in Kyoto and they 
spent some time comparing the two cities.  They talked about the 
prospects of the Japanese volleyball team at the upcoming Pan-
Asian games and also about politics and the latest movies and 
music.  As they waited for coffee and dessert, Kenjo realized 
that he&#39;d completely forgotten about Makoto, about everything 
really other than this fascinating young woman in front of him.

Minako noticed when the spell was broken.  Something had 
distracted Kenjo; she could tell because for the last hour or two 
she&#39;d been completely focused on him.  She knew now that there 
would be no slapping tonight.  The naughty part of her wondered 
what it would take to make _him_ slap _her_, and that line of 
thought brought a blush that she hoped matched her blouse.  She 
could not recall the last time she&#39;d been with someone who took 
such a genuine interest in her.  Not just her body, her hair, her 
face, but in her feelings, her opinions, her dreams.  With a 
start, she remembered what his agenda had been, and again started 
to worry about Makoto.

&quot;Minako-san,&quot; Kenjo started carefully, &quot;I was wondering if you&#39;d 
ever noticed that Mako-chan was closer to any one of your friends 
in particular.&quot;

An odd question and one that made her stop to think.  Just 
getting her mind out of that spell was difficult enough for 
Minako, but she could see in his eyes how important this was to 
Kenjo, so she considered it thoroughly.  He waited patiently, if 
not with a little bit of anxiety, while she formed her answer.

&quot;We&#39;re all very close to one another,&quot; she replied eventually, 
&quot;as I&#39;m sure she&#39;s told you.  But, that said, there are degrees.  
Usagi and Rei share something very special that neither of them 
share with anyone else.  Ami and Rei have known each other the 
longest, except for Usagi, who really brought us all together.  
They were all very close before I got to know them at all, but 
I&#39;ve always considered Usagi my closest friend.  As far as Makoto 
goes, well, I guess I&#39;d have to say that she&#39;s closest to Ami.&quot;

Kenjo smiled, as if this was the answer he&#39;d expected, but still 
he gestured her to go on.

&quot;With Ami&#39;s mom gone a lot of the time, and, well you know about 
Makoto&#39;s situation, they spend a lot of time together.  Almost 
every night, I think.  When all of us get together, they usually 
sit next to each other and sometimes the rest of us catch them 
whispering and laughing together privately,&quot; Minako concluded.  
&quot;Why do you ask?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll explain, I promise,&quot; he said.  &quot;First though, does Ami have 
a boyfriend?&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t see the connection between this question and 
the last, but again decided to trust him and answer to the best 
of her ability.  &quot;No, not really.  There&#39;s this one guy who&#39;s 
always trying to go out with her, but she only wants to be 
friends.&quot; Minako paused for a moment.  &quot;You know, I don&#39;t think 
she&#39;s ever really had a boyfriend.&quot;

&quot;And this guy, the one who wants to date her, is that Urawa-san?&quot;

&quot;Yes, but I thought we were here to talk about Makoto, not Ami,&quot; 
Minako exclaimed.

Kenjo took a deep breath.  He knew what he had to do, but 
couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that somehow he was betraying one of 
Makoto&#39;s confidences, something he&#39;d never done.  Still, he 
reminded himself, she had never told him this, it was only a 
suspicion on his part, and Minako was one of her dearest friends.  
Gazing over at her, he could see that she recognized he was 
deliberating about something important.  The look she gave him 
was full of support and trust.  Again, his desire to help his 
friend was momentarily sidetracked by a sudden lightheadedness.  
His face softened and his eyes smiled; he knew he could trust her 
and that he was doing the right thing.

&quot;I think that Makoto is in love with Mizuno Ami, but I&#39;m not sure 
if she realizes it,&quot; Kenjo spurted out. 

Minako&#39;s eyes went wide and she prepared to debunk this craziness 
immediately.  His expression stopped her, however.  Kenjo was 
deadly serious, and really worried.  She caught herself before 
responding.

&quot;I think she might need help, Minako-san, and I want to help her, 
but I&#39;m not sure how to go about it,&quot; he added.

Minako closed her eyes and tried to remember everything she could 
about Makoto and Ami.  Without trying very hard, she recalled a 
variety of things which could be seen as supporting his idea.  
Actually, the more she thought about it, the more sense it made.  
Despite constant references to her old sempai, Makoto had not 
really dated at all since they met back in Jr. High.  &#39;Unless you 
count Haruka,&quot; she chuckled.  She could remember Makoto dancing 
back in school...but come to think of it, that had been with Ami.  
Minako suddenly remembered a few weeks ago, walking into Makoto&#39;s 
kitchen after a wonderful dinner, and watching her and Ami 
washing and drying dishes together.  She&#39;d said something to the 
effect of &#39;you two look like an old married couple&#39; and Makoto 
had actually dropped a plate!  &#39;Maybe it wasn&#39;t my voice that 
startled her, but what I actually said.&#39;

Opening her eyes, she saw Kenjo patiently awaiting her 
response.  There weren&#39;t many men who would actually give a woman 
time to think; so many of them always seemed to be in a big rush 
for some reason.  &quot;I think you might be right,&quot; she finally said. 
&quot;But, what kind of help do you mean?&quot;  That could be taken in a 
number of ways, and she needed to know how he felt about the idea 
of Makoto and Ami.

Kenjo sighed, unaware till then that he&#39;d been holding his 
breath. &quot;I want to help them get together, if that&#39;s what would 
make her, them I suppose, happy, but I don&#39;t know how to help 
with that. So, what can we do?&quot;
	
Minako considered this, noting with relief that he wasn&#39;t going 
to suggest they try to &#39;cure&#39; Makoto or anything ridiculous like 
that.  &quot;Well, I guess we&#39;d need to figure out if Ami feels the 
same way.  She&#39;s very hard to read, at least for me.  Ami is more 
likely to open up to Rei, so maybe Rei would know.&quot;  She snorted 
with some annoyance. &quot;They&#39;re both so silly sometimes.  Even if 
they weren&#39;t busy deluding themselves, they&#39;d just start trying 
to delude everyone else.  Neither of them is big on expressing 
their emotions openly.&quot;

Kenjo nodded sadly, &quot;She&#39;s been hurt so badly before. Can you 
blame her?&quot;

&quot;No, I suppose not.  And poor Ami, people have been labeling her 
and putting her into boxes for so many years, it&#39;s no wonder she 
has a hard time figuring out her own true feelings.&quot;

&quot;So, what can we do?&quot; Kenjo asked again.

&quot;I think you&#39;ve done all you can,&quot; Minako replied, adding, &quot;for 
now, that is. Let me talk to Rei, and maybe Usagi.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ll let me know how I can help, right?&quot; Kenjo pleaded. &quot;I&#39;m 
supposed to be back in school next week, but I can make it back 
here really fast if you need me.&quot;

Minako reached out and laid a hand gently on his.  His eyes 
widened and shot toward hers, just as she felt the spark shoot up 
her arm.  Putting that aside for the moment, she said, &quot;You love 
her, but so do we.  I&#39;ll let you know, I promise, but for now, 
you&#39;d better just leave it alone.  It may be that none of us can 
do anything but wait for them to sort it out themselves.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just afraid that, left to themselves, they never will,&quot; 
Kenjo pointed out glumly.  The feel of her hand on his skin was 
warming his entire body.  Bravely, he laid his other hand on top 
of hers.  &quot;Thank you, Minako-san, for everything.&quot;  A blush rose 
over her cheeks like a sunrise. 

Suddenly, something caught his eye from across the restaurant.  
He had been so wrapped up; it had taken a while to register.  
Leaning forward slowly, he whispered, &quot;Behind you, at 7:00, in 
the trenchcoat and dark glasses. Isn&#39;t that your friend, Usagi?&quot;

Minako caught herself.  When he&#39;d laid his hand over hers and 
then leaned forward, she&#39;d extended her face (&#39;Face, Minako? Be 
honest! You extended your lips!&#39; that naggy little voice in her 
head chided.)  Now, she pretended to stretch her neck and back, 
looking where he&#39;d indicated.  Six years ago, she wouldn&#39;t have 
been able to catch herself before screaming &#39;USAGI&#39; at the top of 
her lungs.  Fortunately, age brought wisdom.  

&quot;Excuse me one moment,&quot; she said politely, standing up.  Her 
hands felt suddenly cold. Regretfully, she stalked toward the 
back of the dining room.  

Standing before Usagi&#39;s table, she deliberately unclenched her 
fists.  &quot;What are you doing here, meatball-head, and what is with 
that pathetic disguise?!&quot; she hissed.

Usagi giggled and stammered for a moment.  &quot;Well, [heh-heh].. 
Luna took the pen away from me after that time I used it to...&quot;  
In a flash, she smiled broadly and whispered, &quot;He&#39;s really cute, 
Mina-chan, and it looks like you guys are getting along!  I can&#39;t 
believe you were going to kiss him on your first date!&quot;

Minako blanched, then blushed even more deeply than before.  
Sweat appeared on her forehead as she leaned down with a 
frightened look back at Kenjo.  &quot;I was NOT going to kiss him, I 
was just trying to hear him better and you haven&#39;t told me what 
you&#39;re doing here, messing up my date!&quot;  Gently, but firmly, she 
&#39;assisted&#39; Usagi to her feet.

Usagi grinned, &quot;I had a feeling that this one was special, I 
could just tell!  I&#39;m going, I&#39;m going, no need to shove!&quot;

Minako had Usagi halfway to the door. &quot;Get out of here, meatball 
head!&quot;  Then, she remembered something. &quot;We need to meet, 
tomorrow!  Can you tell Rei?&quot;
	
&quot;Sure, I&#39;ll call her from Makoto&#39;s place.  I can tell her and Ami 
there.&quot;

&quot;No, just Rei, you, and I!  It&#39;s important.  Don&#39;t tell Ami or 
Makoto!&quot; Minako urged.

Usagi gave her a funny look, but agreed.  &quot;Ok, ok, and you can 
stop shoving, I&#39;m leaving! Sheesh!&quot;  

After removing the spy from their midst, Minako returned to the 
table to find a very amused Shinozaki Kenjo.

&quot;Hmmph, just for that look, he will have to wait till the next 
date!&quot; she thought.  Approximately 2 hours later, after he&#39;d 
walked her home and said goodnight (and left without a fuss), 
Minako realized that she&#39;d not only decided that there would be a 
second date, but that just about nothing would stop her from 
kissing him before it was over.
