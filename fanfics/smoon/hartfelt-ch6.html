<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 6 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch5.html">Back to Part 5</a><p>“<i>Real lucky. Night Rei...”</i></p><p><i><b>Tick… tock… tick… tock… tick… 
tock…</b></i></p><p>In the desert the night began to retreat against the light of the rising 
sun; its warm rays painted its high canvas above while they devoured the shadows along the 
barren ground below. It was the daily purge of darkness and Mar’s planet breathed in a deep 
breath of life; small gusts of wind swept up across the sand dunes and brandished sheer 
power against the tiny pebbles. It threw contrasting red colors up into the sky, and, though 
the wind proved to be harsh, under the influence of a compassionate hand it softened and it 
was tamed- the flowers were spared and were treated with gentle, whispery caresses instead. 
Other signs of life soon made themselves known as the sleeping inhabitants stirred from 
their slumber, particular those of Mar’s military forces. By the time the sun arrived at the 
palace’s gates, both men and women soldiers were already outside and waiting for their 
training to start. A few of them spent their time with pre-warm up stretching, while others 
watched those who had already begun their daily sparring.</p><p><i><b>Clang! 
Clash!</b></i></p><p>Within the palace walls, Rei stirred. Her hand flew to her face when a 
ray of light smacked her awake.</p><p>“Erg! Stupid…sun…” She growled in annoyance. 
Reflexively her body muscles tensed and relaxed cyclically till she calmed down. Although 
she was tired, the Martian doubted she would be able to fall back asleep now that she was 
awake; there were other thoughts that weighed heavily on her mind.</p><p><i>Last night, I 
had the strangest dream… </i>Rei quietly contemplated. <i>Our planet was preparing to go 
into battle with Uranus when this ditzy blonde dropped in from out of nowhere for a visit. 
She claimed to be the daughter of Aphrodite, and that she was here to improve our planet 
relations. Ha, now that really was awkward. Can there really be a person who talks that 
much, that loud? I shouldn’t forget to mention that she was a total klutz! She was also 
following me everywhere I went like a helpless, lost pup.</i></p><p>The Martian Commander 
shifted uncomfortably as she tried to get up. For some reason, there was a heavy weight on 
her chest.</p><p>“Real lucky, Rei…”</p><p>She froze.</p><p><i>Huh? </i>The raven-haired 
woman felt chills run down her back when the very heavy weight resting <i>atop</i> of her 
chest shifted. She then cautiously opened one eye, just a crack, and then the other. At 
first her vision was blurry and unfocused, but the condition quickly subsided to reveal 
familiar figure in her face. Blonde hair and a red bow, Rei snapped back to 
reality.</p><p><i>IT WASN’T A DREAM! </i>Rei mentally screeched. All the awkwardness of last 
night’s events came rushing back to her and burnt her face with a rosy hue.</p><p>Minako was 
snuggled up against the woman’s side. Her head lay atop of Rei’s chest although the rest of 
her body wasn’t quite there. One of the blonde’s hands lightly gripped Rei’s nightshirt, 
while the other was possessively draped over Rei’s stomach (Minako did mention something 
about always sleeping with a teddy bear earlier- could this be an instinctive reflex?). Rei 
held her breath when the woman twitched; was she waking up? At first the possibility drew 
her curiosity… until the Venusian Princess muttered something in a gushy, incoherent tone 
and snuggled closer!</p><p><i>Oh shiiiit…! </i>Too much blood was rushing to her head. It 
was making her head spin. Rei squirmed uncomfortably. <i>No, no, no! It can’t 
be!</i></p><p>If there was such a thing as ‘fate’ she prayed that they weren’t this 
cruel.</p><p>With one free hand she nervously peered under the blanket to confirm whether 
she was seeing what she thought she was feeling. She gulped. Yes, one of Minako’s legs had 
indeed wrapped around one of her own. Rei seriously doubted that this was any way to treat a 
‘teddy bear’.</p><p><i>Okay, stay calm. All I have to do is wake her up. </i>Rei assured 
herself. The woman was about to lift her arm to nudge the blonde awake when she heard Minako 
sigh happily,</p><p>“So warm…”</p><p><i><b>HUG! Squeeze.</b></i></p><p><i>Ooooookay… that 
is, if I can free my arms. </i>Followed the sarcastic thought. As “fate” would have it, 
similarly to the night before, the woman once again found herself to be at the mercy of her 
companion. Except it was now a matter of squirming away without seriously hurting 
Minako.</p><p>Rei racked her brains; with her arms and leg effectively bound to her sides, 
what could she possibility do?</p><p><i>What can I do? What can I do? What can I do? Oh, I 
can’t believe this! I knew she was a pain when she was awake but this really takes the 
cake!</i></p><p>There was a short pause as Rei urgently glanced around the room’s 
surroundings to distract herself from her awkward situation. Yet as hard as she tried to 
resist it, her eyes finally fell back upon the sleeping figure in peeved wonder. It wasn’t 
fair. How could Minako look so innocent? Her long blonde hair and her beautiful blue eyes 
that were closed in a peaceful slumber… Minako really was a beautiful woman. Rei had rarely 
met anyone with such physical caliber.</p><p><i>Hmm... Speaking of which, the only other 
person that I’ve met with blonde hair was Haruka.<br></i><br>At the mention of the name Rei 
felt her concentration violently ripped away from thoughts of Minako. Her amethyst eyes 
narrowed in an emotionally rare expression of worry.</p><p><i>That woman… How can she be 
so-so stupid? She’s could lose it all at this rate! </i>Rei’s lips curled into downward 
frown. Her eyes were beginning to blur from the reminiscent memories. <i>Since that time… 
everyone’s changed! But me, I’m...</i></p><p>Rei suddenly gasped. <i>Wait a minute. Back 
then, with all of us… </i>The woman stared down at Minako with surprised 
eyes.</p><p>“COMMANDEEEEER!” The moment was shattered with a piercing cry. Rei whipped her 
head around when the sound of hurried footsteps racing down from the hallway outside. “SIR 
REEEEEEEI!”</p><p>She instantly recognized that voice.</p><p>“Zen?” She silently mouthed. 
But what could he be so worked up about, and so early in the morning? Her alarm hadn’t gone 
off yet so-- Rei bolted upright. “OH NO! That’s right! I’m not in my bedroom!”</p><p>Minako 
squeaked when Rei abruptly jumped up and sent her sprawling onto the 
floor.</p><p>“Eep!”</p><p><i><b>WhOmP!</b></i></p><p>Minako slowly flipped herself onto her 
back and pulled herself up to a seated position. Her nightshirt had fallen slightly to one 
side, revealing the white, silky skin of a bare shoulder.</p><p>“Ouchy… Reeeeei, what 
wrong?” Minako yawned and rubbed her eyes sleepily. <i>And I was having such a nice dream 
too! </i>She gestured as she stretched her arms. <i>Rei was there and I remember feeling 
warm all over…and then suddenly things went spinning and I hit something hard! Hmm…which 
appears to be the floor. </i>Minako casually observed.</p><p>She then turned her attention 
to the frantic Martian dashing about the room at an insane speed. She was grumbling 
something about having to find armor and starting lessons?</p><p>“Rei, would you just take a 
chill pill and relax?” Minako’s eyes twinkled with amusement. “I’ve never seen you so… Oh, 
what’s the word? Disorganized? What’s the hurry?”</p><p>“I am not disorganized!” Rei shouted 
in protest. “No thanks to you, I didn’t get up by my usual time!”</p><p>“Your usual 
time...?”</p><p>“For the early morning training sessions! I always start them off! And 
because I happen to be late, no thanks to you, I’ve got some idiot running down the halls 
bellowing for me like a wounded animal!”</p><p>“SIR REEEEEEEEI!” Zen bellowed in a desperate 
voice again.</p><p>“Gosh, that sounds stressful...”</p><p>Rei skidded to a dead halt and 
shot Minako an angry glare. “Well aren’t you looking relaxed?”</p><p>“You bet I am.” Minako 
happily grinned. This irritated Rei even more.</p><p>“Grr, never mind! I’ve got to go, but 
I’ll be back later! You better not get into--”</p><p>“Any trouble, yeah, yeah, I got 
it.”</p><p>But Rei hadn’t bothered to wait around for the answer; she had already rushed out 
the door, making sure to slam it behind her loudly.</p><p><i><b>SLAM!</b></i></p><p>Minako 
listened carefully as she heard the other woman’s footsteps becoming fainter as she made 
distance. Although, the blonde couldn’t say the same thing for Rei’s voice; it was just 
plain loud.</p><p>“Zen, stop that shouting this instant!”</p><p>“R-Rei, Sir! Ah, there you 
are! We’ve been looking all over for you! When you didn’t show up as usual… Where have you 
been?”</p><p>“Never mind that!” Minako heard Rei snap. “When did it become your business to 
know mine? And why in the name of Mars were you chasing after <i>me</i> when you could have 
started the sessions <i>yourself</i>? You are the first officer! Only second in rank to the 
commander! So you better start acting like one! You can’t rely on me all of the 
time!”</p><p>Minako was rolling on the floor laughing hysterically by the time that Zen 
began to stumble over himself to apologize. “Haha, oh wow! Rei really isn’t a morning person 
is she? Hahahaha, poor Zen! I kinda feel bad for him…”</p><p>“I-I-I am very sorry, please, 
forgive-”</p><p>“Enough of that already,” Rei ordered in an exasperated voice. “Are classes 
ten to five out already?”</p><p>“Huh? Oh! Yes!”</p><p>“Good, then assemble classes three and 
four outside for the desert trial run. I believe it was their turn today. Level four should 
be more than challenging for them. Give them a limit of twenty-five minutes to complete the 
test.”</p><p>“Yes, that’s-”</p><p>“After they’ve finished, have the medic class take over 
and start the area at level five. Do not give them the usual ten minutes. Cut it by half and 
aim for five!” Although Minako couldn’t see it, Zen was nodding like a bobble-head figure 
behind his leader. “Once both tests have been evaluated, store the results onto a disc and 
deliver it to me.”</p><p>“Eh? We aren’t going to store the results away into the alliance’s 
computer base?”</p><p>“No.” Rei’s voice suddenly trailed off.</p><p>Noticing this, Minako’s 
curiosity had gotten the best of her; she crept up and pressed her ear against her room 
door. There had been no trailing footsteps so they still had to be there.</p><p><i>Maybe 
this is the best part? I wonder what they’re talking about.</i></p><p>“…Yes, 
you…correct…”</p><p>Minako held her breath. She hadn’t noticed how hard she was breathing 
until now; it was so heavy that she could barely make out Rei’s words.</p><p>“But this is so 
sudden!” Zen cried out. “Who will--”</p><p>“You will. While I’m gone, you’ll have to watch 
over this place until I return. Though you may have thought that I was too strict with you 
in the past, it was to prepare you for this possibility. For years you have been the 
strongest of your class, yet you have this habit of giving up too easily. Consider this your 
final test. Do not waste this opportunity.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p><i>What? Rei’s leaving? 
</i>Minako became alarmed. <i>But why? Where? And W-H-E-N? I want details! 
NOW!</i></p><p><i><b>Creak! </b></i><b>Tup! Woosh!</b></p><p>“Rei!”</p><p>Minako threw 
herself out into the hall. With a very serious pose she stared down at Rei, ignoring the 
questioning look sweeping over Zen’s face.</p><p>“Where do you think you’re running off to?” 
The blonde demanded. “There’s no use in hiding it, I heard all of 
it!”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Both Zen and Rei were strangely silent. The medic openly stared at 
Minako, his face quickly becoming flush from embarrassment. Rei on the other hand, rolled 
her eyes at the same sight until she realized her first officer’s reaction. The poor man had 
developed a nosebleed in shock! Quickly Rei kicked Zen’s legs out from beneath him and sent 
him crashing to the floor.</p><p>“Wha-” Minako started before Rei was suddenly in her 
face.</p><p>“I don’t know about you, but walking out in public halls with only your 
nightwear on might… cause problems.”</p><p>“Problems?” The other woman blinked back. No 
sooner had those words left Minako’s mouth the Commander noticed three young soldiers 
strutting down their way come to a dead stop and began to openly ogle at the Princess from 
Venus.</p><p>“Hey, look at that girl! I haven’t ever seen her around before have 
you?”</p><p>“Blonde hair? Blue eyes? Get real! She must be a foreigner!”</p><p>“Yeah, but a 
real pretty one…”</p><p>“You three! Report to clean-up duty this instant!” Rei barked with 
such ferocity that one of the men looked like he was about to wet himself from 
fright.</p><p>“Y-Yes Sir!”</p><p>“Right away Sir!”</p><p>And they scampered 
away.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>“Hmph, I meant, that kind of trouble,” Rei 
pointed out with a frown. “...Zen, if you can’t stop that nosebleed then go to the restroom 
and tend to it! You are dismissed.”</p><p>“Yes Sir.” The man groaned. “Thank you 
Sir.”</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></p><p>After the man disappeared Rei shook her head. 
<i>How embarrassing!</i> “Now do you see Minako?” Though she would never openly admit it, 
Rei was secretly impressed that Minako could disarm four of her men without lifting a 
finger. She made a note to work on that in the future.</p><p>“I think so… But, Rei, are you 
saying that <i>you</i> aren’t affected by my appearance?” Minako said very deliberately and 
slowly. She took a step towards Rei but the woman held her ground. The Martian was starting 
to get that bad feeling again as she noticed the odd swing in the blonde’s 
steps.</p><p>“Affected? Excuse me, but what kind of question is that?”Rei attempted to stare 
Minako down, but she was finding it rather difficult. She just kept on getting closer, no 
matter what she did.</p><p>“Honestly Minako, just go get dressed already.” Rei finally broke 
their gaze and turned her head. She was completely aware of their closeness, yet she refused 
to budge.</p><p><i>I don’t know what kind of game she’s playing, but </i><i>she’s definitely 
trying to intimidate me.</i></p><p>“You know… you’re cute when you blush like that Rei 
bear--”</p><p><i><b>Shove! Whup!</b></i></p><p>Rei hit the closest wall in surprise. She 
barely had time to register what had just happened when she felt two arms pinning her to the 
wall by her shoulders.</p><p>“Hey! What are you doing?! I don’t have time for this 
now!”</p><p>“You can spare some time…” The sad look Minako was giving Rei shut the Martian 
up instantly. “I asked you, where are you going? I overheard you and Zen talking, don’t even 
think of denying it.”</p><p>Rei gave the other woman a long, hard stare. She already could 
see where this was going. “No. You can’t come.”</p><p>“But why not?!”</p><p>“Because I don’t 
want to be burdened with extra worries.” The raven-haired soldier replied in a dead voice. 
Something inside tugged at her heart as soon as the words had left her mouth, but she 
couldn’t say what.</p><p>Minako expressed shock when her mind registered the blunt response. 
<i>I’m a burden? </i>But in a blink of an eye it was gone and replaced with a look of 
determination.</p><p>“What do you think will happen if you leave me here alone? You said I 
was trouble didn’t you? What if something happened to me while you are away?”</p><p>“There 
are nine classes of trained soldiers, including the replacement leader,” Rei paused to 
cringe at the word ‘leader’. “Anyone would be foolish if they tried to harm you with that 
kind of protection.”</p><p>“But you saw their reactions!”</p><p>“Are you saying my men are 
scum?” Rei shot back. But she didn’t pursue the accusation because she knew that she 
couldn’t defend her soldiers’ honour after the last four’s actions. “Look, if you’re that 
worried, you can stay in your room and lock the door until I get back. There are also other 
security systems other than our soldiers.” Rei was almost tempted to also suggest that 
Minako could also go home. But for some reason, the words remained caught in her 
throat.</p><p>As for Minako, she couldn’t understand why Rei was being so stubborn. The 
Martian had allowed her to tag along up until now, so what difference would another trip 
make?</p><p>“So basically… you’re telling me to lock myself up?” There was a hint of fear in 
her quivering voice.</p><p>The emotion struck a familiar cord within Rei herself. 
Uncomfortably, Rei shifted her feet. She really wished Minako would drop the subject; there 
was nothing for the Venusian to gain in coming along.</p><p><i>Who knows what will happen? 
But… then again, I was only going to ask Mercury to give Hotaru a bio-scan. That couldn’t be 
too bad, could it? </i>Without realizing it, Rei was already reconsidering her earlier 
decision. <i>And after we get the bio-scan done, we just come back and that’s it. Besides, 
Mercury is our official ally. The chances of being attacked are slim to none.</i></p><p>In 
the back of her mind, there was another, more compelling reason that refuted the fear of 
being attacked.</p><p>“Minako…” Hearing Rei’s voice made the blonde looked up. “Umm, you 
know…” <i>Oh damn it, how am I going to say this? </i>“Maybe my decision earlier was a 
little too… no, that’s not right! I mean… Umm, I just remembered that Hotaru will be coming 
along and…”</p><p>“You need a babysitter right?” Minako instantly jumped at the 
offer.</p><p>“Yeah, I guess that sounds right?” Rei whispered under her 
breath.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>“Nothing! I was just thinking how Hotaru might be intimidated by 
the soldiers.”</p><p>“You’re absolutely right! And we both already know how much Hotaru 
likes me. I’m much better suited for child care than they are.”</p><p>“Mm...” <i>Actually, 
</i><i>I don’t know about that…</i></p><p>“Great, so let’s go!” Minako turned to leave when 
a sudden force gripped her arm. She threw Rei a quizzical glance over her 
shoulder.</p><p>“Maybe, you should get changed first…” Rei commented. Her head was turned to 
the side as she said this.</p><p>“Hey, you know you like it.”</p><p>“I-In your dreams!” She 
sputtered.</p><p><i>Ugh. Maybe this wasn’t such a good idea after all. </i>Rei watched 
Minako disappear back into her room. However, she couldn’t overlook this tiny warm glow she 
felt inside. It was distinctly pleasant compared to what she felt since Ares had taken her 
in. But even though it was small, the raven-haired woman took special note of it.</p><p>“No, 
I still have to be careful…” Rei whispered to 
herself.</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p><i>Huh? </i>Rei whirled around towards the source 
of the sound, only to see an empty corridor. <i>Is it just me, or did I just sense someone 
there?</i></p><p>“…”</p><p>As she strode away, a pair of Amethyst eyes blinked. Having 
gathered some interesting information, with a whip of dark brown hair, the figure was 
gone.</p><p><u>(Mar’s</u> Space Terminal, Afternoon)</p><p>The space terminal was crowded as 
ever. Most of the groups consisted mainly of diplomats and merchants scurrying about in a 
frantic rush to find their shuttles. Some travelers wore thick cloaks, while some others 
wore business suits. Some wore fancy clothing and some wore nothing but casual wear. 
However, it was only the guards who were staffed at the ports entrances that wore 
armor.</p><p>“People!” Hotaru muttered out of curiosity. She always liked seeing new things. 
<i>Huh? </i>The girl peered up at her guardian when she felt her hand being squeezed 
gently.</p><p>“Now you be good a girl, Hotaru,” Minako smiled back through the hood of her 
cloak. “Rei said she’d come get us once the preparations are 
complete.”</p><p>“Pre...parations?” She made a face at the complicated word.</p><p>“Mhm. 
That’s right.” Minako nodded and kneeled down in front of the child. “Do you see all of 
these people running around? Well, how to put it… they’re either going to work or they’re 
going home.”</p><p>“We go home?”</p><p>“Umm, well, no, but that’s beside the point!” Minako 
gave a nervous laugh. “I guess you can say that Auntie Rei is going to work and she’s taking 
us with her.”</p><p>Hotaru’s eyes lit up at the mention of ‘Auntie Rei’. “I like Auntie 
Rei…” She admitted shyly. “Papa said Auntie Rei is a little scary, but she not scary at 
all!”</p><p>Minako thought back to this morning’s discussion between Rei and 
Zen.</p><p><i>If only she knew... </i></p><p>“Haha, actually… about that.” Minako was so 
absorbed in her mental debate whether or not to expose her fiery tempered companion that she 
never noticed the shadow leering over her. “Rei is like…how to put it? Very stubborn. She 
won’t listen to anyone once she’s made up her mind! You know, I don’t think I’ve met anyone 
who’s as hard headed as her. Sure! She may have the looks and the strength, and be the 
leader of planet, and the leader of an army, and…Hmm…”</p><p>“Oh, please don’t stop 
there.”</p><p><i>Eep!</i> Minako cringed. <i>I know that voice!</i></p><p>“R-Rei! What a 
surprise!” She was met with Rei’s intense gaze; she found the usual signs of irritation, but 
for a moment Minako also thought she glimpsed amusement in those eyes as well.</p><p>"Auntie 
Rei!” Hotaru waved, asking to be picked up. Without any thought Rei swept up the little girl 
into her arms.</p><p>“Hey! I’m supposed to be the babysitter, remember!” Minako protested. 
Her confidence wavered in that instant. What if Rei decided to change her mind 
again?</p><p>“Oh, that’s right.” Rei shrugged and handed the child back over to Minako’s 
care. “I’m sorry Hotaru, but please bear the torture for a little while longer.”</p><p>“HEY! 
Was that supposed to be some kind of crack?” Minako’s demanded. Her eyebrow twitched 
dangerously. <i>Eh? Hey, wait a minute. Did Rei just make a joke? Oh my Goddess! She 
actually has a sense of humour? </i></p><p>Minako stared at Rei’s quickly disappearing back 
in wonder. <i>It couldn’t be, could it? Is she finally opening up to me...?</i></p><p>“Don’t 
just stand there! We have a shuttle to catch!” Rei shouted over her shoulder.</p><p>“You 
don’t have to tell me that! I already know!”</p><p>As Minako ran off to catch up to her 
traveling companion, she was oblivious to the short stranger who stared at her from the 
crowd. Seeing where the two women were heading, the figure dashed off to the side towards 
that general direction.</p><p><u>(Within the Shuttle viewing area)</u></p><p>Rei stood 
behind the viewing glass that separated her and the people outside of the shuttle. Her eyes 
narrowed in concentration as she scanned the various faces. Something was bothering her; 
there was no mistake, she was certain of it. She had felt that same presence back within the 
palace walls within this area.</p><p><i><b>Wrrrrrrrrr…</b></i></p><p>Behind her, Rei could 
hear the shuttle door closing. <i>It’s about time.</i> Rei inwardly grunted as she watched 
the action from the glass’s reflection. <i>The longer we hang around here, the longer it 
will take us to get to Mercury.</i></p><p><i><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></i></p><p>“I put Hotaru to 
bed and she’s sleeping like a baby!” Minako reported. Rei glanced to the side of the glass 
to see that Minako had entered the room.</p><p>“Mm, that’s good. These kinds of trips are 
always difficult for young children,” Rei explained. “Things go by a lot faster if they 
sleep.”</p><p>“Oh, I see!” Minako shouted enthusiastically. Rei turned around, startled by 
the unexpected response.</p><p>“What? Did I say something wrong?”</p><p>“No, it’s just… I 
thought everyone knew about that, especially you. Haven’t you ever ridden in a space shuttle 
as a kid?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Well, you must know that the ruling God and Goddess normally 
give birth to only one child, correct?”</p><p>“…?” Minako tilted her head to the side at 
this.</p><p><i>Something’s not right.</i> Rei analyzed. Minako’s behaviour was anything but 
what she had expected it to be. She looks almost confused. This information couldn’t 
possibly be anything new to her, right?</p><p>Rei decided to press on.</p><p>“Because the 
ruling God and Goddess only have one child, that child automatically becomes the planet’s 
representative and heir to the throne. Therefore, it’s customary for the heirs to attend 
gatherings with their parents to meet with others like themselves. But you knew all of that 
right?”</p><p>“Ahaha… r-right! I couldn’t have said it better myself!”</p><p>Rei narrowed 
her eyes. Normally Minako was the pushy one. When their roles were suddenly reversed it made 
the Martian wonder what the blonde was trying to hide from her.</p><p>“I’m just a little 
tired I guess…” Minako finally broke the silence with an honest smile.</p><p>Rei took notice 
in the woman’s sudden change of aura. Minako was definitely worn out from something, but the 
cause of the condition eluded her. Minako had gotten some sleep last night or did 
she?</p><p><i>But I’d know the answer to that if I hadn’t fallen asleep first! </i>Rei 
mentally kicked herself. <i>Who knows what she did while I was knocked out! 
Grr…</i></p><p>“Rei?”</p><p>“If you’re tired then go take a nap or something! We’ll have a 
lot of walking to do once we arrive on Mercury.”</p><p>“Eh? But why walking? I thought 
Mercury was the most technologically advanced planets in the solar system!”</p><p>“So you 
know about that,” Rei crossed her arms and leaned onto the wall beside the window glass. 
Behind her was a dark sea, dotted by millions and billions of stars. <i>It’s still something 
at least… </i>“Minako, it’s not that they don’t have the transportation technology or that 
their landscape makes it impossible to use mechanical travel…rather it’s…No. Never mind. I 
wouldn’t worry about it until we get there.”</p><p><i>Because anything can happen, </i>Rei 
reminded herself. It was one of the reasons why she never visited Mercury often; their 
leader was… how would one put it…? Unique in her own ways...</p><p>“I would suggest resting 
up until then.”</p><p>Rei had expected Minako to catch onto the fact she had just been 
dismissed, but the blonde didn’t move.</p><p>“Can I stay here with you?”</p><p>“If you think 
I’m going to be your pillow again, you are mistaken,” Rei warned. The last memory brought a 
crimson blush to her cheeks.</p><p>“Aww… as nice as that would’ve been, I actually wasn’t 
going to ask that.” Minako waved a finger at her companion. “Actually, I wanted to know if 
you would play a game of cards with me. You know, to pass the time?”</p><p>This time it was 
Rei’s turn to tilt her head. “A game of cards? You mean like a guessing game where you have 
to guess the number of the opponent’s card or something like 
that?”</p><p>“Yeah!”</p><p>“I’ll pass.” Seeing the pout Minako was putting on, Rei advised, 
“It’s a waste of time. Believe me.”</p><p>“But it still passes the time!” Minako 
persisted.</p><p>Rei shrugged. There really wasn’t any point in arguing this any further. 
She knew the Venusian wasn’t about to let this drop (she could already the other woman was 
dragging an empty table towards her).</p><p><i>The woman must be deaf or something because 
she never listens to a word I say, </i>Rei concluded. And as usual, more often than not, Rei 
had a reason backing her advice.</p><p><i>There’s actually a very good reason why I don’t 
play card games…</i></p><p>“Okay! So first I’ll draw five cards and then I’ll give you five 
cards. You know how to play Go Fish right?” She saw Rei nod slightly. “Okay, that’s good! 
Then I don’t have to explain it to you! I warn you though; I’m really good at this game. 
Hey, don’t roll your eyes at me! Just you wait Rei, once I beat you, you’ll see.” Again Rei 
rolled her eyes with a bored look. “’Kay, so I’ll go first if that’s all right with you. 
Just to get the game flow going! Ahem, do you have… a four?”</p><p>Without skipping a beat, 
Rei immediately responded in a flat voice, “Go Fish.”</p><p>“But you didn’t even look at 
your cards!” Minako protested. “How could you know whether or not you have a four? Go on, 
look at them! They won’t bite!”</p><p>The Martian humoured the other woman and looked at her 
cards. For a moment, Rei feigned a very thoughtful expression before repeating, “Go 
Fish.”</p><p>“Hmph, fine. But you’d better be telling the truth.” Minako warned in a sweet 
voice as she drew a new card from the deck.</p><p>“And if I’m not?”</p><p>“Oh, I can always 
find out. I have my ways.”</p><p>“Uh huh,” Rei shrugged, unconvinced. <i>She’s obviously 
bluffing.</i></p><p>“Now it’s your turn Rei-bear!”</p><p>“Would you please stop calling me 
that?” Without hesitation Rei then asked, “Do you have a seven?”</p><p>“Uhh… yeah actually, 
I do! Good guess!” Minako handed the other woman her card. “Go again! You definitely can’t 
get lucky twice in a row!”</p><p>“An ace.”</p><p>“… R-Right again! Jeez, you really are good 
at this game.” <i>Maybe better than me…</i> Minako worried.</p><p>“How about… a 
ten?”</p><p>“...”</p><p>“Well, am I right or not?”</p><p><i>You see… card games are a waste 
of time for me because of my psychic abilities. I don’t need to look at a card to know what 
it is.</i></p><p>“No way, you’re right again! How are you cheating? Are there mirrors on the 
ceiling or something?”</p><p>“No, not at all.” Rei calmly assured her. “As I recall, I told 
you these games are a waste of time for me--”</p><p>“Wait, I’ll figure out this trick too! 
Give me a few rounds and I’ll get it.”</p><p>“…” <i>Umm…</i> “But Minako…”</p><p>“Don’t even 
think of backing out! I’ll win one yet, just watch!”</p><p>(<u>One hundred rounds 
later…)</u></p><p>“Just you wait… I’ll… win… one yet…” Minako’s head hit the table, 
scattering the cards all over the floor, after losing this round atop of the last one 
hundred. Rei shook her head.</p><p>“You really are too competitive for your own 
good…”</p><p>“Who says?”</p><p>“The person who beat you one hundred times.” Minako sweat 
dropped. “Look Minako, for the last time, there’s no trick to this and you CAN’T win against 
me. You have to be born with this kind of ability…”</p><p>“OH! So you mean it’s one of those 
psychic abilities? Now everything makes sense... 
you-were-only-cheating-by-using-psychic-abilities-that-no-one-else-can-use-because-you-have-to-be-born-with-them.” 
Minako brought her knees up onto the chair and stared at Rei as she sulked.</p><p><i>She 
doesn’t take losing well does she? </i>Rei stared back.</p><p>“Well, with that done and 
aside,” Rei coughed, “I think we’re going to arrive at Mercury shortly. So why don’t you go 
and check up on Hotaru? I’m sure she misses you.”</p><p>“Mm… Fine! I’ll be right back, so 
don’t you move an inch!” Minako shouted and gestured a finger at Rei. “Because when I get 
back we’re going to play different game of cards and I’ll be sure to win at that one for 
sure!”</p><p><i>Isn’t that supposed to be my line? </i>Rei waited until the blonde ran out 
of the room and out of sight before she visibly relaxed. <i>Goddess, it’s very annoying when 
a person doesn’t listen to a word you say! I must have given up trying to explain it to her 
after round ten. Although, I have to admit... her reaction every time she lost a card was 
amusing. The way she would frown, and then beg teary eyed at the cards as if she were hoping 
it would magically change their numbers… oh and I can’t forget the little tantrums she threw 
throughout the game. Sometimes, she can really be like a child. Venus Minako, Daughter of 
Aphrodite, huh? We’ll see about that…</i></p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“Hm? ” <i>Well, 
well…</i> “It appears that our guest has arrived.”</p><p><i><b>Tup! 
Tup!</b></i></p><p>“Yipe!”</p><p><i><b>Clatter!</b></i></p><p>Rei calmly rose from her seat 
and strode across the room. When the Martian reached the doorway and peered around the 
corner, her suspicions were confirmed; down on the floor a familiar figure gripped her knee 
in pain while uttering a string of curses. It took the young girl awhile to realize that she 
had an audience.</p><p>“Nozomi.” Rei’s eyes flashed.</p><p>“Hm? Ah! H-Hello there!” The girl 
caught sight of her superior. <i>Uh-oh, she looks angry! </i>“I uhh… 
daaaaaang...”</p><p>“Don’t give me that. What are you doing here? I told you specifically to 
stay at the palace!”</p><p>The hardness in Rei’s voice snapped Nozomi back to her normal 
self.</p><p>“Grr… I’m here because of you! It’s YOUR fault, so stop looking at me like 
that!”</p><p>“My fault?”</p><p>“We were supposed to have lessons today but you never showed 
up! I thought you slept in or something so I came to drag your lazy carcass out and fight 
me, but guess what? You were having a lovely chat with Minako! Did you have a lot of fun 
ditching training? You guys were looking pretty close there,” She added 
venomously.</p><p>Now Nozomi had done it. The girl almost regretted those words as soon as 
they left her mouth because Rei’s aura was dangerously seeping through her calm exterior. 
Occasionally a strand of the red power would flare out briefly before the Martian leader 
forcefully crushed it.</p><p>“I had business to attend to.” She replied coolly. However, Rei 
chose not to elaborate further and Nozomi noticed this.</p><p>“Yeah, and you were going to 
take Hotaru and Minako along too! Just the three of you, going off to visit another planet 
by yourselves! Hmph. That’s so like you, going off on an adventure and leaving me behind.” 
Nozomi growled under her breath and glared stubbornly at the floor. Rei raised an eyebrow at 
this. “Maybe some people nee—er, want to know where you are! Haven’t you ever thought of 
that? Running off without a word isn’t very leader-like you know! Not only does it make you 
irresponsible but unreliable too! How any of those dolts for soldiers can trust you, I’ll 
never know,” Nozomi gestured with a shrug. “And that,” she slammed her hands against the 
floor, “is why someone has to keep an eye on you!”</p><p>“You mean ‘you’?”</p><p>“Who 
else?!” Nozomi shot back. “I’m more than competent enough! I did sneak on board without you 
knowing didn’t I?”</p><p>“Well, not quite.” Rei interrupted. Nozomi blinked at the news in 
surprise.</p><p>“W-What did you say?”</p><p>“To put it simply, almost any child can sneak 
about without being detected by a strong spiritual presence. Even Hotaru could accomplish 
exactly what you did.”</p><p>“No way, you’re lying! There’s no way someone like Hotaru could 
do something like that!”</p><p>“I’m not lying. What I’m saying is absolute truth.” Rei 
paused. A thought came to her just then. “You were complaining that I ‘ditched’ your lesson 
today, so listen up! Because this will be today’s lesson instead. For high order beings such 
as Gods and Goddesses, it’s actually easier for them to detect a strong spiritual power 
rather than a weak one. To be undetectable you would have to be either as weak as a child or 
have undergone strict training in aura suppression. In rare cases, however, it is possible 
for a child to be detected if there is already some evidence that can be traced.” Seeing the 
confused expression from her pupil, Rei explained, “Memories, common ties, anything 
bonding.”</p><p>“Oh, I get it now… so you’re saying I’m weak!”</p><p><i>You’re completely 
missing the point! </i>“No, I’m saying that you’re a child!” She shot back in irritation. 
They both exhausted heated glares.</p><p>“Whatever,” Nozomi huffed and crossed her arms. 
“Why are we talking so much about kids anyway? They’re weak and useless—Most of them are 
that is, but I’m not!” Nozomi caught herself upon remember Rei’s earlier remark. Her cheeks 
burned at the memory. “I mean, what do Gods and Goddesses have to worry about anyway? 
They’re super powerful!”</p><p>Her Commander fell silent.</p><p>“What? You know I’m right. 
Gods and Goddesses rule planets and they can control planet power! You said so during our 
last lesson!”</p><p>“...Yes, I did say that, didn’t I? However, there is this legend... I 
don’t suppose you’ve heard stories of the Sun Kingdom, Nozomi?” Nozomi shook her head and 
Rei bit back a bitter chuckle<i>. </i></p><p><i>I didn’t think so. People of this day and 
age are so ignorant of their people’s history.</i></p><p>“Anyway, there are legends that 
tell of a God who used to live on the Sun, and that many referred to him as Sun King Apollo, 
the ruler of the Gods. Remember, you were the one who asked why children had any relevance. 
As the stories go, they say that Apollo used an army of children, armed with the knowledge 
of aura suppression, to spy upon the other Gods and Goddesses in his court for him. Commonly 
they were also used for assassinations. This is the important part. The combination of being 
a child and being trained in the arts of killing creates the perfect soldier. Does that 
answer your question...?”</p><p>“Uhh…But i-it’s only a story right?” Nozomi was trying her 
best not to let her uneasiness show.</p><p>“Of course it is! Firstly, no God or Goddess 
takes orders from anyone. And two, nothing can live on the Sun; it’s only a hot ball of 
gas.”</p><p>“Oh. Good.” <i>Because that just sounds creepy! </i>The young girl bit her 
bottom lip. <i>I’m glad it’s not like that on Mars.</i></p><p><i>She’s relieved. </i>Rei 
inwardly smirked She was surprised the story had that much impact on the girl. <i>I wonder 
if Minako’s heard of that tale before…</i></p><p>After all, it was just a silly story. 
Although, what Haruka had said earlier didn’t quite bode well for them. It brought a frown 
to the soldier’s face.</p><p>“<i>Rei. Hino Rei, my long time friend… We’ve found it-- one 
half of the key.”</i></p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></i></p><p>“Rei-bear!”</p><p>“Minako...”</p><p>“Look who I brought!” The woman 
enthusiastically waved. When Rei peered around at the blonde she could see little Hotaru was 
trailing slightly behind the woman’s large steps. That is, until she spotted Rei and 
Nozomi.</p><p>“Nozomi! Auntie Rei!” Hotaru squealed as she ran to tackle Nozomi with a 
hug.</p><p>“Gah! Hotaru?! Not in front of Rei!” She hissed. <i>This is so 
embarrassing!</i></p><p>“Oh, so Nozomi’s here too?” Minako questioned. The diplomat wondered 
what sort of strings the girl pulled to convince Rei to bring her along. After all, Rei 
really was a mountain of stubbornness. “This is great! We all can play cards 
together!”</p><p>“You never learn, do you?” Rei interrupted.</p><p>“Nope. But I’m telling 
you, this is one game you can’t cheat at!”</p><p>“Whatever.”</p><p>Without missing a step 
Minako took this opportunity to lean into Rei’s side and asked, “So, what did she do to 
you?”</p><p>Rei frowned, confused for a moment. “Oh? You mean Nozomi? Nothing.” <i>Which is 
true, </i>The Martian thought to herself. “She was with us the entire time during the trip. 
In fact we were both having a lovely chat before you and Hotaru showed up.”</p><p>“You mean 
you just invited her along while I had to argue with you?” Minako stepped back in a huff of 
indignation. She was livid with jealously. <i>Yeah right, like I’d believe that! Something’s 
up, I know it!</i></p><p>“What are you guys gossiping about now?” Nozomi shot the pair a 
suspicious look.</p><p>“Cookies?” Hotaru offered.</p><p>“Cookies?” Rei repeated. Her blonde 
haired companion decided to elaborate for her.</p><p>“Well the only way I could get Hotaru 
up was by promising to buy her some cookies when we landed. So I hope you don’t mind, but 
can we stop off at the market place or something on the way to the 
palace?”</p><p>“Minako…”</p><p><i><b>Beep. Beep. Beep-beep! </b></i></p><p>Everyone turned 
their heads as a voice shortly boomed over the speakers.</p><p>“<i><b>Attention passengers, 
we have arrived at the planet Mercury’s space port. It is now time…”</b></i></p><p>“So...I 
guess we’re here then!” Nozomi affirmed what was on everyone’s minds. <i>This is so awesome! 
I’ve never been on another planet before! </i>Her curiosity danced at the surface of her 
amethyst eyes, quite the opposite of Rei’s. Rei was looking either disinterested or 
actually, Nozomi wasn’t quite sure what her superior was thinking. The Martian leader was 
hard to figure out, period.</p><p>“Let’s head for the nearest exit,” Rei advised, though to 
everyone else it sounded like she was giving a command. “The crew will send our things ahead 
of us.”</p><p>Without another word (and not knowing what else to do) they all followed Rei 
down a series of metallic hallways until they stopped before a large door. Rei analyzed the 
barricade for a moment; her eyes seemed to be searching for something, but her concentration 
wasn’t on the door itself.</p><p>“It’s this button, right?” Without waiting for a reply, 
Minako pressed a red button to the side. The light in the panel above it turned green, 
shortly before a sound of moving gears dominated the area.</p><p><i><b>Creeeak, creeeeak, 
creeeeak…</b></i></p><p><i><b>WOOSH!</b></i></p><p>“!”</p><p>A gust of wind tore through the 
chamber and hit the group. Everyone but Rei gave a shout of surprise.</p><p>“W-What’s going 
on?!” Nozomi cried.</p><p>Through her raised arms, Minako peeked to see a crystallized, blue 
wall in her line of vision. For a second she thought she was seeing things.</p><p><i>What is 
that? It almost looks like...a wall? But what’s that doing there?! Where’s Mercury? Oh! 
Unless...is it like Mars’s capital city?</i></p><p>Rei outstretched her hand despite her 
hair whipping wildly around her, and touched the barricade as she muttered something under 
her breath. As soon as her lips stopped moving a stream of light shot out from the structure 
and wrapped itself around Rei’s extended arm. Its energy swirled up along the limb up to 
Rei’s face and then down her legs before it flung itself back at the wall with a loud 
collision. The insignia of Mercury appeared on the crystallized surface. The tense moment 
was punctured when the wall suddenly cracked and broke down altogether. Like pieces of a 
broken mirror, the barricade was stripped and, behind it, it revealed Mercury’s Capital 
City, <i>Astallos Curio</i>.</p><p>“You all better stay close.” Rei instructed.</p><p>The 
wind died down and the atmosphere immediately rang with the voices of people. High 
technology based buildings of all sizes came into view. They littered the central grounds 
farther than the eye could see, while along the city’s outer limits ran the famous 
Tran-transportation circuit. From an aerial view, its design formed the shape of a symbolic 
circle that loomed just above the business areas. At a first glance, it was apparent that 
the people of Mercury led a very different lifestyle from those of Mars. The city’s 
inhabitants flocked to the train stations like bees to honey. One after another, the crowds 
would just pile into a car and be shuttled off as another car road in and filled up once 
again. The movement was endless. It was as if a mini space terminal had been built inside 
the city.</p><p>“We’ll be walking to the palace over there. If any of you get lost, which 
shouldn’t happen,” Rei warned in a low voice, “head over there. That will be our point of 
destination.”</p><p>She was pointing far across the city to the palace. It was most 
noticeably the largest structure in the entire city. Though it’s most distinguishable 
feature was not its size, but the fact that it wasn’t quite as high tech as the surrounding 
areas. The front grounds were laid with a carpet of green turf, not concrete. And the palace 
itself wasn’t made from piles of glass, wires or metal, but of marble. Like Mars and Venus, 
Mercury’s palace had preserved its ancient history and it undeniably radiated an aura of 
superiority. The machines below almost appeared to bow down before it.</p><p><i>Wow…</i> 
Nozomi thought. She thought her brain was going numb in shock. <i>I’ve never seen anything 
like this at home!</i></p><p>“Nozomi, don’t fall behind!” Rei barked.</p><p>The girl whipped 
her head around to see that Minako, Hotaru and Rei had already descended the first row of 
steps. Behind her, at that very instant, another load of people had just arrived at the 
platform and they quickly swarmed into the area.</p><p>“I-I’m coming! You don’t have to 
treat me like a child!”</p><p>The dark haired girl managed to make it down half of the steps 
before she bumped into someone.</p><p><i><b>Whomp!</b></i></p><p>“Oof!” She fell, but the 
tall, cloaked figure caught her before she hit the hard cement. “I-I’m sorry, really! I was 
just trying to get over to my friends and I—I really should have watched where I was going,” 
She rambled awkwardly. The person watched the young girl silently through their hood before 
turning their attention towards the rest of the group when Rei 
bellowed,</p><p>“NOZOMI!”</p><p>“Uhh, thanks for catching me, whoever you are, but I’ve 
really gotta get going now,” Nozomi again thanked before she ran off. “I’m coming Sir 
Rei!”</p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup Tup!</b></i></p><p>“Rei...?” The cloaked person had barely 
caught the girl’s words. In wonder they brought a hand to their hidden face and silently 
pondered to themselves as the newly re-united group disappeared into the crowds.</p><p>“So 
she’s finally arrived…” They chuckled.</p><p><u>(Mercury’s Business Sector)</u></p><p>“We’re 
only here for cookies right?” Rei’s eyes darted around at all the booths.</p><p>“Yup, a 
promise is a promise.” Minako said too soon before a shiny stone caught her eye. 
“Oooh!”</p><p><i>Yeah right… </i>Both Rei and Nozomi simultaneously thought.</p><p>“It’s so 
pretty, right Hotaru?” On the display booth were lines of gemstones, all of which were 
polished perfectly smooth and waxed till they shone. For a moment Minako put Hotaru down as 
she inspected the golden stone which had caught her eye. “Rei, Nozomi, come take a look at 
this!”</p><p>From the ground, Hotaru looked up at her blonde guardian and then around the 
crowd at all the new faces. But one in particular caught her gaze, a cloaked figure standing 
to one side of the incoming stream of people. Hotaru blinked as the person looked up, 
noticing that they had been spotted. For a brief instant, the girl saw a pair of dark, green 
eyes.</p><p>“Papa…?” She cooed.</p><p>As everyone was too busy arguing with Minako, no one 
noticed as the girl began to wander off.</p><p>“Come on Minako, that thing is obviously a 
fake.” Rei retorted.</p><p>“I’d have to agree with Sir Rei this time,” Nozomi nodded. “So 
can we go now?”</p><p>“Aw, you guys are real party-poopers! Half of the fun in shopping is 
window shopping!” Though the logic made no sense whatsoever to Rei or Nozomi, they both 
nodded anyway with a ‘sure, if you say so’, attitude. “But if you insist on spoiling the 
fun, fine. I just happen to know how to tell whether it’s fake or not without spending hours 
at it.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“Ta-da!” Minako pulled out a card deck.</p><p>Rei blinked back. 
“You want to play cards at a time like this? Do that after we get to the palace!”</p><p>Upon 
hearing this, Minako sighed and shook her head as if she were talking to a child. “Such 
ignorance…tut, tut! This isn’t the same deck of cards! Now watch and behold, Rei-bear, my 
number one card trick!” The woman picked a card off the top of the pile and showed its blank 
face to Rei and Nozomi. Then she turned her attention to the stone and held the card’s 
faceless side towards it and said,</p><p>“It’s a fake.”</p><p>The card glowed and jumped out 
of her grasp, and fell to the table directly over top of the gem. Once everyone leaned in to 
get a better look, they saw that the once blank face now possessed the photograph of the gem 
stone.</p><p>“What do you know? It was a fake after all.” Minako shrugged as she picked up 
the card. She waved the thin material in the air for a bit and the image 
disappeared.</p><p>“How did you do that?” Nozomi asked wide eyed as the blonde stored away 
the cards in her traveling bag.</p><p>“It’s nothing really,” Minako assured. “It’s like a 
guessing game. You ask the cards questions but in an indirect way. If what you say is true, 
then the card will reflect the image of it. Doesn’t matter what it is, it will show you a 
symbol or a picture, just something! But if you’re wrong… it just goes black. My mother gave 
them to me before I left.”</p><p>“That’s so cool! I’ve got to get something like that 
someday! Right, Sir Rei?”</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>But the Martian Commander was on 
the alert. <i>Something’s here…</i> Her eyes flew across the crowds in intense 
concentration. It puzzled her. Who could have that level of power in a place like 
this?</p><p>“Minako- grab hold of Hotaru. We’re leaving right now.” Rei said 
stiffly.</p><p>“Eh? But why?”</p><p>“Are you telling me that you can’t sense 
it?”</p><p>“Sense what?” <i>I don’t understand what she’s talking about.</i> Minako thought 
in confusion as she bent down to where she placed Hotaru. “What do you think Hota-” She was 
startled when she felt her hand tapped hard ground. <i>Where’s… 
</i></p><p>“Hotaru?”</p><p>The question didn’t go unnoticed by her travelling companions. 
“What’s wrong?”</p><p>“It’s Hotaru, she’s gone!”</p><p>“What?!” The raven-haired woman 
demanded. “What do you mean, gone? You supposed to be watching her!”</p><p>“I-I… Hey, all of 
us were supposed to be watching her! Don’t just go blaming me!”</p><p>“Tch.” <i>Then there’s 
only one thing to do! </i></p><p>Closing her eyes, Rei began to concentrate. She could feel 
her consciousness slip away from her body and fall into the crowd, weaving and searching 
around every person for some trace of the little girl. Every so often she thought she heard 
that noise again, but as soon as she sensed the presence it was gone. Whoever it was, they 
were infuriatingly fast.</p><p><i>Come on... Where are you? I can’t lose you! </i>A lining 
of purple crossed her path and she jumped. The dark purple was like a powdery cloud, a 
spiritual trail left behind where Hotaru must have wandered. Rei trained onto it with every 
ounce of power she had but it was a mistake. Her vision grew fuzzy in her eagerness. <i>Must 
relax, just relax…</i> She told herself. After a couple of deep breaths the images cleared 
and came back into focus better than before. Again she was on the trail. Not surprisingly 
the evidence didn’t venture far from the area. However, she received a great shock when the 
trail ended where a cloaked figure stood.</p><p><i><b>Ping!</b></i></p><p>“Over there!” 
Rei’s eyes snapped open and she bolted in the direction of the sound.</p><p>“Wha- Rei! Wait 
up!”</p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! Tup! Tup!</b></i></p><p>But Rei wouldn’t stop. She bolted through 
the city’s maze of towers with a maddening urgency. There were so many people- she knew it 
was the busiest section of Mercury, but the number of people was really starting to piss her 
off. That was why she hated crowds. Why did they all have to get in her way? She had nearly 
run into a person more than a few times (if she didn’t possess the agility she had, she 
surely would have).</p><p>“Get out of the way!”</p><p>“Woah! Watch where you’re going 
kid!”</p><p>“Idiot!” Rei cursed under her breath.</p><p>“Rei, where are you going?” She 
could hear Minako cry out from behind her. A glance over her shoulder told her that the 
blonde was keeping up somewhat, but Nozomi was barely hanging in there.</p><p>“I know where 
Hotaru is.” Rei told herself.</p><p>“Huff...! Huff...!</p><p><i><b>Tup! Tup! 
</b></i></p><p>“Huff! Huff! Huff!”</p><p><i><b>Tup! 
Tup!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Skiiiiid!</b></i></p><p>Panting for breath, Rei ran through dark, 
narrow alleyway and into a clearing of a vacant lot. There she had found what she was 
looking for, and more. Up ahead, Hotaru had crawled up to the cloaked figure and was 
asking,</p><p>“...Papa?” She tugged the fabric at their legs. The person chuckled and sent 
shivers down Rei’s spine. That voice sounded oddly familiar.</p><p>“I’m sorry little one, 
but I’m not your papa.” The person apologized. When they bent down to pick up the child, Rei 
cried out,</p><p>“Don’t touch her!”</p><p>“Hm?” The other party halted their movements and 
left the girl alone.</p><p>Minako and Nozomi finally caught up, and stepped up beside Rei. 
The Venusian also felt nervous at the sight of the stranger.</p><p>“I don’t know who you 
are, but please leave the child alone.” She stated in a formal tone. “She belongs in our 
company. We would like her to return to us, <i>unharmed</i>.” She stressed.</p><p>The figure 
remained silent.</p><p>Minako stared long and hard at the person. <i>If only they didn’t 
have that hood over their eyes…</i> She was startled when Rei suddenly 
growled,</p><p>“Enough of this crap. Let me make it clear to you. If you don’t get away from 
that child I’ll move you by force!”</p><p>“Sir Rei…” Nozomi whispered in awe. The sheer 
force and determination that Rei possessed suddenly made her feel insignificant. <i>I wish I 
could do something to help…</i> “Hey, look!” Nozomi cried out in alarm; the cloaked opponent 
began walking towards them in deliberate, slow steps. A green aura electrically charged the 
air around them.</p><p>“Geh.” Rei leapt ahead of Minako and Nozomi, and took on fighting 
stance.</p><p><i>So that’s the way you want to play huh?</i></p><p><i>Rei… </i>Minako 
watched the woman’s backside. From a glance she could see Rei’s aura flaring up as well. It 
was incredibly strong! She wondered if Rei was really controlling it or if it was always a 
burning flame, like on the battlefield against Uranus.</p><p>Sh<i>e’s always fighting isn’t 
she? Soldier this, soldier that, a leader’s responsibilities… There must be something I can 
do!</i> Unconsciously her hand slid down her traveling bag to a certain pouch. <i>Wait! I’ve 
got it. There IS something I can do!</i></p><p>Minako thrust her hand inside the pouch and 
withdrawn her deck of cards. The sudden action stole Rei’s attention 
momentarily.</p><p>“Minako, this no time to be playing cards!” Rei scolded the other woman. 
Her eyes were quickly drawn back to her opponent; their aura had leapt up another notch, 
creating a strong electric effect in the air. Rei nearly flinched when whispery threads of 
electricity flew past her face.</p><p><i>What the--? </i>Her eyes suddenly widened. <i>It 
couldn’t be!</i></p><p>“Actually that’s where you’re wrong! This is a perfect time to play 
cards!” Minako threw the deck into the air and the cards scattered in the wind. “Call 
it!”</p><p>“Grr…” Rei sought for the information in her mind. She only had to guess 
right?</p><p><i>What do I have to lose? </i></p><p>“Fine! Here goes! Thunder!” A card 
amongst the swarm overturned and depicted a green thunderbolt. <i>The guess was correct!</i> 
Rei confirmed. On the other end the figure had hesitated for a moment in surprise, but they 
quickly resumed their movements. Encouraged, Rei cried, “Strong, Gentle, Caring, 
umm...Goddess! Spear!” The cards kept flipping, each revealing a new picture. She knew who 
it was now.</p><p>“Jupiter Makoto!”</p><p><i><b>Flash!</b></i></p><p>The last card to hit 
the ground flipped up with a picture of a person on it. Minako gasped in shocked. <i>Did I 
hear what I thought I heard? Could this person be a…</i></p><p>“That’s some card trick.” The 
figure chuckled as they bent down to pick up the card and peered at the picture. “Wow... Do 
I really look like that?”</p><p>With that the hood was pulled back to reveal the person’s 
face. It was a young woman, no more than Rei and Minako’s age. Her long, chestnut coloured 
hair was kept back in a ponytail, and rose-shaped earrings hung from her ears.</p><p><i>Wow, 
she’s really pretty…</i> Minako almost blushed. <i>I like her eyes…</i> The other woman’s 
eyes were a beautiful shade of bright green, but saying that’s all they were would be an 
underestimation. All the emotions and history that surely hid beneath those pools of green 
mystery would surely drown any curious adventurer. <i>But I like Rei’s a lot more.</i> 
Minako inwardly giggled.</p><p>“Are you...really a Goddess?” Minako finally asked. The green 
aura around the stranger died down within a blink of an eye.</p><p>“I suppose so,” The other 
woman smiled. “Oh, and aren’t you a cutie?” She finally picked up Hotaru, without protest 
this time, and Hotaru gave a happy laugh.</p><p>“She means yes,” Rei translated curtly. “Now 
tell me, what you’re doing here? Do you have some of business with Mercury or what? Planet 
leaders aren’t supposed to leave their planet, that’s what representatives are 
for!”</p><p>“Blunt as always Rei,” Makoto walked over to where the group stood and handed 
Hotaru back to Minako. “Actually, I do have business with Mercury. But neither of us has 
seen you for such a long time, so we decided that I should come and get you.”</p><p>“Why 
didn’t you just so earlier?!”</p><p>“Well, where would the fun be in that?” Makoto 
laughed.</p><p>Rei’s right eyebrow was starting to twitch dangerously. “Makoto…”</p><p>“Now 
Rei…” Minako tried to calm the other woman. “Be nice. So, I take it that you’ve known Rei 
for awhile?” She addressed the Goddess.</p><p>“Mhm. But we can talk about that later. Right 
now, Mercury is waiting for us.”</p><p>“Oh, when I see her, I’ll…” Rei grumbled and trudged 
away.</p><p>“…?” Minako watched the fiery tempered woman head off with Nozomi in the 
palace’s general direction. <i>I wonder what’s eating her? She just met up with a friend. 
What’s so bad about that?</i></p><p>“She hates losing,” Makoto 
offered.</p><p>“Losing?”</p><p>“Well, you see… Mercury is the top engineering scientist of 
her people, and she doesn’t only monitor her planet’s records, but she watches over Mar’s 
and Jupiter’s records as well. Anything and everything, she’s always updating the databases. 
So whenever Rei comes over for a visit, Mercury always has some sort of test up her sleeve 
to gather some data from her. Like a personal check up if you will. That’s probably why Rei 
doesn’t come to visit very often. Or that’s what I think anyway.”</p><p>“But… how did Rei 
lose?”</p><p>“It was a detection test. Since Rei couldn’t sense me without using those... 
interesting cards,” She added, “She lost. I’ve been watching all of you since you left the 
space terminal.”</p><p>But Minako wasn’t really listening.</p><p><i>So she’s known Rei for 
awhile? I’ve only met her but she seems like someone who just might be able to hold her own 
against Rei. I’m not sure what it was, but that power I felt back then, both her and 
Rei’s... for a moment, I was almost... scared.</i></p><p>“You sure know a lot Lady 
Jupiter.”</p><p>“Hm? Oh please! Makoto is fine. To be honest I really don’t know a lot, but 
I know enough to get by. Anyway, I’m sorry, but I don’t believe I’ve asked for your name. 
Are you a friend of Rei’s?”</p><p>“Well, I think so… but silly Rei just hasn’t realized it 
yet!” Makoto sweat dropped. “My name is Venus Minako. It’s nice to meet ya!” Minako extended 
her hand.</p><p><i>Huh? Venus Minako?</i> Makoto questioned herself. “Did you just 
say…‘Venus’?”</p><p>“Hm? Yes, I did.” Minako smiled back. “Why?”</p><p>“Ah! No, it’s 
nothing!” Makoto took the other woman’s hand and shook it. “It’s nice to meet you 
too.”</p><p><u>(Asta, Palace of Mercury)</u></p><p>Rei marched up the marble steps towards 
the presence that surely awaited her at the top. For once, she was grateful for all these 
ridiculous steps- she had plenty of time to regain her composure, and this time she was 
determined to keep it.</p><p>“Ami!” Rei barked as she entered the entrance with the others 
following closely behind. “I know you’re there with that little computer of yours. Come out 
right now!” She demanded.</p><p>A figure in the shadows watched the Martian through the blue 
screen of her data analyzer and smiled. How well Rei knew her…</p><p>“You can calm down. I’m 
right here…” The blue haired leader stepped into view.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the group 
her hair was short. As for her dress wear the woman sported a pair of white shoes and pants, 
but the rest of her attire consisted of a blue shirt and a thin, translucent scarf that 
wrapped around her neck. At first, Minako was confused. Was this woman really the leader of 
the most technologically advanced civilization in the solar system? Ami’s physical frame 
appeared almost delicate, and her soft voice was anything but a fighter’s. But it was 
misleading because at first sight Minako felt the hairs at the back of her neck stand on 
end. As the blue screen dissipated away from the other woman’s eyes, Minako caught a glimpse 
of the blue aura around Mercury. It was only for a split second, but she had seen 
it.</p><p><i>She’s just like Rei and Makoto…</i> Minako shivered. <i>But almost scarier! I 
can’t quite explain it.</i></p><p>The absolute calm that Mercury carried brought the 
Venusian to wonder what would happen if that still surface broke. She’d never seen an angry 
Goddess before, but she was sure that she would never want to see the blue-haired woman 
angered.</p><p>“It’s good to see you again Rei,” Ami greeted, her intelligent blue eyes 
reflecting the warmth in her voice.</p><p>“Hmph,” Rei returned a cross look.</p><p>“Oh come 
on Rei, don’t be like that,” Makoto stepped up behind her and lightly held the shorter 
woman’s shoulder. Minako was mortified. <i>My Rei!</i> She wanted to shout. “You know you 
missed us. Admit it!”</p><p>“…Yeah, okay… maybe I did…” Rei reluctantly muttered. “But not 
those tests!”</p><p>Mercury merely smiled in understanding. They’ve been through this many 
times before.</p><p>“Yes Rei, I know. However, they <i>are</i> required. It’s essential that 
I update your personal statistics frequently… otherwise, if there should be a problem in the 
future I won’t be able to help you to the full extent of my knowledge and capability. 
Besides, the tests will keep you alert and healthy. We all know how important it is for a 
planet’s ‘leader’ to keep in top physical condition, don’t we?”</p><p>Rei turned her head 
away and Makoto sweat dropped. Silently behind the close friends, Minako handed Hotaru over 
to Nozomi. Although no one else was going to correct Rei’s attitude, the Princess of Venus 
wasn’t about to let this pass any longer; after all, etiquette, manners, and love were key 
on her home world.</p><p><i><b>Tup!</b></i></p><p>“H-Hu--- Gaaah!” Rei cried out. Minako had 
caught her from behind and threw her into in a surprisingly effective headlock. “W-What are 
you doing you crazy girl? Let go of me!”</p><p>“You know Rei... I reeeeeally think you need 
to be a little more thankful that people care for you,” Minako easily fought off Rei’s 
pathetic struggles.</p><p>“I don’t need you telling me what to do! Ouch, watch it, my 
neck!”</p><p>“Oh my, and who is this young lady?” Ami inquired.</p><p>“Who--” Rei and Minako 
started.</p><p>“Me?”</p><p>“Her?” Rei almost fell down and died of laughter right there. 
<i>Young lady? PFFFFT!!!!</i></p><p>“Cut. That. Out!” Minako tightened her hold. “My name is 
Venus Minako. Hey, I’m warning you Rei... It’s nice to meet you.” She again addressed 
Ami.</p><p>“Venus?” Ami glanced over to Makoto and saw her nodding back. “I see. My name is 
Mercury, Ami. It is also a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I would imagine that you and 
your companions are tired are your long trip. Perhaps we should all retire for some rest and 
discuss matters later. I believe Rei will need it,” She giggled.</p><p>“Oh?” Minako looked 
down to see Rei’s face turning blue from lack of air. “Oops.” She suddenly released her hold 
and Rei dropped to the floor gasping for breath.</p><p><i>I’ll-- never let that-- happen 
again! </i>The raven-haired woman vowed. <i>Her and Ami will definitely get along. Crazy 
women!</i></p><p>“Hey, you asked for it.” Minako waved a finger in front of Rei’s face. She 
wasn’t a mind reader, but she had a pretty good idea of what was going through the Martian’s 
mind at that instant.</p><p>“Hmph. Let’s see <i>you</i> run through land mine fields and 
dodge lasers every visit,” Rei muttered. “Honestly Ami, why can’t you test Makoto or any of 
the others too?! I swear! You’re going to kill me with all these tests before I even get the 
chance to grow old!”</p><p>Ami let out a small gasp and looked hurt. For a moment Minako 
thought the blue-haired ruler was going to cry. After seeing this reaction, Rei distanced 
herself from the others and hung her head. The woman was shocked herself; in all of the time 
she’s been kept those kinds of feelings bottle up inside the control she had over them was 
suddenly gone in an instant. It bothered Rei; Ami didn’t deserve that and she knew 
it.</p><p>“Rei!” Makoto also looked mortified. “You know we wouldn’t…”</p><p>“Grow old?” 
Minako asked, confused. “What are you talking about Rei? Don’t be silly, Goddesses can’t 
grow old.”</p><p>With all eyes on her, Rei knew where this was going and she didn’t like it 
one bit. Ami and Makoto’s uncomfortable expressions were already getting on her 
nerves.</p><p>“I think I need some rest after all,” She announced. “Nozomi, Hotaru, come on. 
I’ll make sure you get a room.” The two girls were just as confused as the others were, but 
they obediently followed the Martian.</p><p>“Rei…?” Minako asked again. She was about to 
follow Rei, too, when Makoto caught her arm. “What did I say?”</p><p>“Minako… you mean, 
don’t know?” When Makoto saw the ignorance reflecting in the blonde’s eyes, she 
knew.</p><p>“Know what?”</p><p>Minako watched Makoto hesitantly threw a questioning gaze 
over to Ami, who nodded back. “Rei isn’t exactly… well, like us.” She then released the 
Venusian’s arm. But Minako didn’t even feel her arm fall back to her side. Suddenly, she 
just felt numb.</p><p>“Not like us? You mean she’s not a…?”</p><p>Minako looked to Makoto 
and then to Ami. Ami nodded but remained silent. She was still having difficulty regaining 
her composure from Rei’s last remark.</p><p>“Yeah… she’s not a Goddess.” There, Makoto had 
finally said it; yet she couldn’t say it without grimacing at the term. “You see, because of 
protocol, the planet heirs are supposed to meet with the other future heirs at various 
events throughout the year. As far as I can remember, Mar’s leader always brought Rei with 
him. So I thought she was like the rest of us too, and it was a shock when I found out, 
believe me. But it’s not like it made a difference. We all still consider her our close 
friend. That’s why… we worry about her, Ami especially. It’s the reason why she’s always 
giving Rei these tests. Because she worries…”</p><p>“Please, if you will excuse me…” Minako 
said weakly. “I think I need some time to be alone.”</p><p><i>I need time to 
think…</i></p><p>As soon as she saw the nods Minako left the room. Both Ami and Makoto 
stayed silent until the blonde woman disappeared from sight and they could no longer sense 
her presence.</p><p>“Do you really think we did the right thing by telling her about Rei?” 
Makoto asked in a quiet voice.</p><p>“I believe so. If Minako starts to see Rei differently 
now because of this, then…”</p><p><i>You’re still trying to protect her. </i>Makoto turned 
around and embraced the blue haired woman in a hug. Ami allowed herself to be taken into 
those strong arms. Almost instantly did she finally calm down; it was comforting to know 
someone was there for you.</p><p>They stayed like that for what seemed like forever until 
Ami finally whispered,</p><p>“She said she was Venus Minako…”</p><p>“I know, but it’s still 
too early to tell. I can definitely sense some kind of Goddess power within her. It’s faint, 
but it’s there…”</p><p>“During all of our childhood visits… am I forgetting…?”</p><p>“No,” 
Makoto shushed the woman. “It’s not you, and I’m sure Rei’s noticed it too. During those 
visits…there was no Venus Minako.”</p>
