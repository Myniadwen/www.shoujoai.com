<h1>Love at Last: A Makoto and Minako Fic (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/darksider.html">Darksider415</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Note: I strongly encourage you to review this piece. Flames are 
accepted, as long as they point out the areas in which I can improve my 
writing, instead of assaulting my character, choice of pairings, or my 
lack of sanity. This fic is written from Makoto&#39;s POV. It may be as long 
or as short as I feel like writing, whether anyone likes it or not, so if 
I don&#39;t post any more parts, it&#39;s because I lost interest in the project 
and decided to scrap it. Instead of posting the prologue as a separate 
chapter, it is in one unit with the first full chapter, for my own 
randomly decided reasons.

Prologue:

My Problem

This is my problem. I have been in love with Minako for a while, to put 
it mildly. Ami-chan and Rei-chan have been together for a few months 
and nothing bad has come of it, unless you consider Rei getting kicked 
out of a homophobic Catholic school and being disowned by her father 
bad, but I&#39;m still afraid that Minako-chan will call me a freak or 
something. I can&#39;t help but feel a little guilty about it, though. I 
mean, every time I see her, I can&#39;t help but wonder how I can keep 
myself under control. When she smiles, it&#39;s like the heavens have sent 
down an angel to make our worthless mortal lives just a little more 
pleasant. Did I neglect to mention her beautiful golden hair that 
cascades down her back and the way she has that cute red ribbon to tie 
it off... It&#39;s enough to make me scream in ecstasy at the thought of 
her. I could never prove myself worthy of her love, could I?
