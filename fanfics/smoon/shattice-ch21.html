<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 21 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a>

<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch20.html">Back to Part 20</a><pre>&quot;We have to join after school Clubs, too?&quot; Yaten
complained as they walked the school&#39;s halls, his
white hair shining, &quot;When are we supposed to sleep, I
wonder?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s quite that bad,&quot; Ami Mizuno said
mildly, the blue haired young woman having been asked
by Taiki to come along. She had seemingly been adopted
by the Three Lights as a guide, probably based on the
fact she didn&#39;t squeal and faint when they talked to
her.

&quot;We do tend to have a very busy schedule,&quot; Taiki
calmly explained, the reddish brown haired man
shrugging slightly, &quot;with commercials, concerts and
other commitments.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t have to join a club,&quot; Haruka said to them
with a slight frown on her face, the sandy brown
haired young woman walking beside Ami as she studied
the three cautiously, &quot;but it does help you to be
sociable.&quot;

Much like a protective older brother Haruka kept an
eye on Seiya when he was around Ami, a dynamic that
Ami found amusing as well as oddly touching. She
didn&#39;t have much experience with family, being an only
child, and found her close association with the
Outers&#39; household enlightening to say the least.

&quot;At least there&#39;s a fairly good variety of clubs to
join,&quot; Seiya noted optimistically as he studied a
print out, his long black hair flowing down his back
in a ponytail.

&quot;It still sounds stupid,&quot; Yaten scowled.

All of them were watched adoringly by the young women
in the school, though at times it was a little
difficult to tell who they were studying more. First
of all the Three Lights were already quite famous with
their good looks and singing, second there was the
dangerous attraction that many girls had to Haruka,
and finally there was Ami, who seemed unaware that her
brooding, intense aura was drawing girls like flies.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Haruka thought to herself with some
amusement, &#39;part of Ami&#39;s charm is that she is still
unaware.&#39; She, on the other hand, had been aware since
she was a kid her effect on the fairer sex, and had
used it as needed.

&quot;I think I&#39;ll join the computer club,&quot; Taiki noted
calmly, &quot;and I note that the school has an astronomy
club, too.&quot;

&quot;You would,&quot; Yaten sighed. He peered at the list a
moment before admitting, &quot;I suppose there are a few
fun clubs....&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve already been asked by the football team to
join,&quot; Seiya confessed. He smiled winningly at Ami,
&quot;So which clubs do you belong to?&quot;

&quot;Hmm?&quot; Ami looked up, the scar that ran across her
face pale in the afternoon light. &quot;Most of the science
clubs,&quot; Ami admitted, &quot;though I dabble in kendo.&quot;

&quot;Japanese swordsmanship?&quot; Taiki raised an eyebrow,
&quot;you mentioned that before. Still, it seems mildly out
of character for you, if you don&#39;t mind my saying.&quot;

Ami&#39;s mouth tightened slightly, almost as if in pain,
then she forced a smile, &quot;I like being unpredictable,
I suppose.&quot;

Yaten opened his mouth then closed it, unsure of what
exactly to say. &quot;Do we have that photo thing to deal
with today?&quot; he asked Seiya mildly.

&quot;For the next few days, yes,&quot; Seiya agreed with a
sigh. He noted the time then said apologetically,
&quot;Thank you for your help, but it looks like we&#39;ll have
to be going.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Haruka offered cheerfully.

&quot;We&#39;ll probably need it,&quot; Taiki noted as they headed
off.

&quot;Sorry about that,&quot; Ami murmured as they headed to the
nurse&#39;s office, running a hand through her hair
tiredly.

&quot;I don&#39;t mind getting away from them early,&quot; Haruka
said with a casual shrug. She looked over at Ami
thoughtfully and asked, &quot;Are you all right? With the
patrols the last few nights you can&#39;t be getting much
sleep.&quot;

&quot;I can manage,&quot; Ami reassured her. Her eyes seemed
haunted a moment as she remembered, &quot;Chibi-Usa used to
have nightmares pretty frequently when I first took
her in, I got used to managing on very little sleep.&quot;

Setsuna heard them as they walked in the room, the
black haired older woman finishing up a bit of
paperwork. &quot;I understand,&quot; she smiled gently at Ami,
&quot;Hotaru had similar problems after we adopted her.&quot;

&quot;I never knew,&quot; Ami admitted, thinking of the
confident young woman who cared so much for Chibi-Usa.

&quot;You freed her from Mistress Nine and healed the
damage she did,&quot; Haruka said quietly, &quot;but that
doesn&#39;t mean there weren&#39;t scars.&quot;

Ami smiled wryly, &quot;One day we&#39;ll have to compare
notes, Hotaru and I.&quot;

Setsuna closed her notebook and got up, stretching out
with a sigh. &quot;Done at last,&quot; she smiled, &quot;are we
heading home?&quot;

&quot;I think so,&quot; Haruka said. They headed out of the
building, the sandy blonde frowning to herself as if
she was deep in thought.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Ami asked quietly as they
walked, slipping her hand into Setsuna&#39;s once they
were out of sight from the school.

&quot;I&#39;m just tryin&#39; to think how to tell you I&#39;ve got
good news and bad news,&quot; Haruka confessed with a
shrug.

&quot;Bad news first,&quot; Setsuna said, &quot;it&#39;s easier that
way.&quot;

&quot;I need to ask you two to take care of Hotaru on
Saturday night for us,&quot; Haruka smiled suddenly as she
continued, &quot;but the good news is that you&#39;ll all get
to go to the Three Lights orchestral concert on
Michiru and I.&quot;

&quot;How did you manage to get tickets to that? It&#39;s been
sold out for weeks,&quot; Ami blinked. What she didn&#39;t add
was, &#39;And why get tickets? I thought you hated them.&#39;

&quot;We got all the tickets for free, actually. Michiru is
playing violin in the performance and she wants me
there backing her up on the piano,&quot; Haruka explained,
&quot;so I can&#39;t be out in the audience keeping an eye on
Hotaru as planned.&quot;

&quot;Not that Hotaru needs someone to keep an eye on her,&quot;
Ami said dryly. She looked up at Setsuna, &quot;Do you
mind?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;d love to,&quot; Setsuna flashed a smile, &quot;we could even
consider it a date.&quot;

Ami blushed and Haruka fought back a grin. The two of
them had been going very slow in the whole dating
thing; understandable considering both of them had
issues about relationships. Setsuna hadn&#39;t dated in
all the time Haruka had known her, and Ami had been
involved in only abortive relationships.

&quot;I was thinking of sending a ticket to your mom,&quot;
Haruka added to Ami impishly, &quot;but I wasn&#39;t sure you&#39;d
approve.&quot;

&quot;Knowing my mother she&#39;d be cheering us on,&quot; Ami
winced.

Setsuna suddenly chuckled softly and both women looked
at her. &quot;Sorry,&quot; she said with a smile, &quot;I just had
the sudden mental image of Nicole in the background of
one of our dates waving around &#39;Go Ami!&#39; signs.&quot;

Haruka and Ami both laughed at that. &quot;So what does
Chibi-Usa think of having Nicole as an honorary
grandmother?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;They get along quite well now,&quot; Ami said
thoughtfully, &quot;though my mother had some issues with
my taking care of Chibi-Usa originally.&quot;
&quot;As any mother would, I think,&quot; Setsuna noted wisely.

&quot;Maybe,&quot; Ami nodded, &quot;but that was partially why I
moved out finally. Knowing that mom disapproved of
what I was doing was making an already stressful
situation even harder.&quot;

&quot;Something she regrets now,&quot; Haruka said thoughtfully.

&quot;Hmm,&quot; Ami nodded. She smiled faintly, &quot;Mom even
offered to buy a bigger house for us to live in, but I
find I value my independence.&quot;

&quot;Once a bird leaves the nest it&#39;s hard to return,&quot;
Setsuna quoted.

&quot;Ain&#39;t that the truth,&quot; Haruka nodded.</pre>
