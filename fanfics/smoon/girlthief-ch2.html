<h1>The Rich Girl and the Thief (part 2 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/girlthief-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>     Seiya tossed and turned.  &quot;No....no leave me alone...&quot; she 
whispered.  Ever since she could remember she kept having a dream.  
There was a girl in the dream.  The girl had long silver hair tied 
back into a ponytail much like Seiya&#39;s and she was always painting or 
playing the piano.  Seiya was always watching her from a tree outside 
what Seiya figured was the girl&#39;s bedroom, looking in the window at 
her paint of play.  The girl would always look out the window and 
smile at her.  Then an evil shadow would come over her and she was 
screaming for Seiya&#39;s help.

      Thats when Seiya woke up.  The same spot every night.  Thats 
when Seiya would wake up, stare at the ceiling and fall back asleep, 
her dreams weren&#39;t haunted for the rest of the night.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      The &#39;boss&#39; looked at his clip board again the next day. &quot;Ok you 
guys...&quot;

      Seiya raised an eyebrow. &quot;Ahem.&quot;

      The boss sighed. &quot;Yeah yeah....ok you guys..and girl..&quot;

      Seiya smiled and flashed a peace sign.

      &quot;Yeah, now.  We&#39;ve been doing alright until now.  But the 
authority is looking for suspicious looking boys now.  So, Faitaa, 
you&#39;ll be pleased to hear that you&#39;ll be going on the bigger raids 
from now on.&quot;

      Seiya jumped up and down.  &quot;YAY! YAY! YAYAYAYAYAY!!!!&quot; she 
started doing cartwheels around the room infront of the boys.

      The boys sweatdroped as she started doing backflips over them.  
During one backflip Kai reached up and grabbed her ponytail.  Seiya 
came crashing down on top of him. &quot;WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT FOR?!&quot; she 
demanded. She only got a muffled reply from underneath her.  
Snickering she got up and looked down, she started laughing even more.  
Kai lay on his back with swirly eyes.

      The boss sighed and threw his hands up in the air and turned to 
leave.  &quot;Faitaa,&quot; he started, looking over his shoulder.  &quot; you&#39;re 
first assignment is to take on of these clowns and go to the rich 
man&#39;s house at the edge of town.  He&#39;s out of town and his daughter is 
taking care of the place all by herself with a nanny who doesn&#39;t give 
a crap about the house or her.  So go in there, steal something, and 
come back out, got it?&quot;

      Seiya mock saluted. &quot;Sir!&quot;

      The boss shook his head and walked out of the room. &quot;Why do I 
even bother...?&quot;

      Seiya nudged Kai with her foot and looked around.  &quot;Ok, which 
one of you little pickpockets wants to acompany the perfectly gorgeous 
Figter, Faitaa, on a mission, ALONE, at NIGHT.&quot;  She knew that Water, 
Fire, Lightning, and Sky all had crushes on her and were serious 
perverts.  Kai was more like an older brother. Water started jumping 
up and down. &quot;Me!! ME ME ME!&quot;  Seiya sweatdroped as the other boys 
except the one under her foot did the exact same thing.  She did NOT 
want to be stuck with one of those four...not in their present 
state....  She picked Kai up by his hair.  &quot;Okay, this is my choice, 
see the rest of you later....&quot; and she walked out, dragging the 
protesting Kai out by his hair.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Yaten sighed and walked out the door of her home.  &quot;Gosh.....its 
so cold out here....&quot; she pulled her shawl around her tighter.  &quot;Well 
atleast I actually get to go outside now.  Daddy wouldn&#39;t let me go 
outside when he was here.... He said the place was filled with thieves 
and murderers.  I&#39;m sure its true, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be out in 
broad daylight, I mean seriously.  I&#39;m thirteen, I think I&#39;m old 
enough to take a walk outside of my house by myself....&quot;  With that 
said, she walked down towards the shops to buy some art supplies.  Her 
guardian didn&#39;t think it was necessary for her to paint, so Yaten took 
it upon herself to refill her painting supply.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Seiya walked down the street muttering to herself.  Kai was 
following her and rubbing his head.  &quot;You didn&#39;t have to drag me by my 
hair you know Faitaa....&quot;  Seiya didn&#39;t even acknowledge that he was 
there. His eye twitched. &quot;HELLO?!!&quot; he whacked her upside the head 
with a stick.

      The onlookers watched, perplexed as Seiya fell flat on her face 
onto the ground, leapt up a few seconds later and started pummeling 
the boy behind her.  Words were caught out of mid air such as &quot;Brat, 
evil boy, little girl, pervert, bully, bastard, b**ch, and similar 
phrases..&quot;  In the end however, Seiya appeared on top, dragging him 
down the street once again by his hair.

      &quot;OOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!&quot; was the last thing the people in that side of 
town heard before the two dissapeared down another street.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Yaten was talking to the paint vendor about the best type of 
paint for what canvass when Seiya and Kai were walking down the 
street.  Seiya stopeed short and Kai ran into her.  &quot;Hey! Whats the 
big idea?! Why did you stop?!&quot;  Seiya covered his mouth with her hand 
and stared at the girl. 
      
      Its the girl from my dreams..... she thought.  The same girl 
that haunts me every night after I fall asleep....who is she?!
      
      When Yaten was paying the vendor a police man was walking by and 
saw the large amount of money that she had, a very suspicious amount 
of money.  &quot;You there, girl!&quot;

      Yaten looked around before pointing at herself.  &quot;You mean me?&quot;

      &quot;Who else do you think I mean?  Where did you get so much 
money?!&quot; he demanded suspiciously.

      Yaten looked confused.  &quot;My father gives me allowance and it 
kept piling up.  I&#39;ve never set foot out of my house until this very 
day.&quot;

      The police man growled.  &quot;You expect me to believe that?!  You 
probably stole it you little theif!&quot;

      Seiya and Kai had watched the scene.  Both of them knew all the 
thieves in town.  And Seiya was the only girl thief.  They knew that 
the girl must be telling the truth.  So, the police weren&#39;t only 
looking for suspicious looking boys, but girls as well...

      Seiya&#39;s eyes widened when the police man grabbed a hold of 
Yaten&#39;s arm despite the young girls strugles.  Her anger flared and 
she reached back behind her, grabbed an apple from the fruit vendor 
and chucked it at the police man.  &quot;Hey! Big fat and ugly!  Who do you 
think you are?!  Picking on young girls like that?!&quot;

      Kai and Seiya had been through simlar experiences before.  Seiya 
would distract the policeman while Kai worked the crowd against the 
&#39;picking on the victim&#39; in this case, a young girl.  While the crowd 
was getting angry at the police man, Seiya would grab the &#39;victim&#39; and 
make a run for it.  However, usually, the victim WAS a theif....but 
not in this case.

      Kai was getting better at the working of the crowd.  Half the 
people were already advancing on the apple covered police man angrily.

      Yaten however was staring at Seiya wide-eyed.  Seiya ran 
forward, and did not follow the usual plan, much to Kai&#39;s 
astonishment.  She leapt up and kicked the police man down with one 
blow, grabbed Yaten&#39;s arm, and the two ran.

      Yaten looked back at the art vendor who was watching, amused.  
Then she noticed her newly paid for paint set was sitting on the 
counter. &quot;Hey! M-my paint set! I payed for that!&quot; she complained to 
Seiya.  Seiya nearly fell over.  Here she was, saving this girl from 
jail and she was worried about a PAINT SET?!  She called over her 
shoulder and used Kai&#39;s public name that they had come up with 
especially for these emergencies.  &quot;Hey!  Kat!  Grab the paint set for 
the girl and lets go!&quot;

      Kai glared at her, but none the less grabbed the paint set, told 
the vendor he was taking it to the girl and ran down the street after 
Seiya and Yaten.
