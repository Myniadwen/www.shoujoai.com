<a href="../smoon/angelvenus-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&quot;Something like that?&quot; Mitsuki whispered quietly, staring at Nami and 
Ririko in confusion. They looked...older, somehow, but how could that 
be? She had only been gone for two weeks... &quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&quot;Enough of this.&quot; Ririko stood up, and the familiar red glow surrounded 
her once more. When it faded, she was clad again in her kimono, though 
now with copper arm and shoulder guards. A necklace with a scarlet jewel 
hung from her neck, her hair pooled down her back in carmine waves. &quot;You 
were always one to talk, Nami. Now, the time for talking is over. We&#39;ve 
found her; now we kill her.&quot; The air around them crackled with energy, 
magic pooling through the atmosphere, creating a hazy blanket of deep, 
maroon fog. Ririko&#39;s eyes narrowed, became a blazing crimson as she held 
her katana in front of her.

&quot;Crush the false prophet and let&#39;s be done with it!&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

fallen knights

All alone, cold fields you wander

Memories of it, cloud your sight

Fills your dreams, disturbs your slumber

Lost your way, a fallen knight

Final Fantasy X, Otherworld


Mitsuki stumbled back, gaping at the two women in front of her in 
confused, hurt shock.

Danger...this will grow to be a violent situation. Although baffled by 
this turn of events, Mitsuki knew that, despite their childish 
arguments, Nami and Ririko fought remarkably well, their severe, almost 
manic ways of fighting interweaving and creating an intricate, 
beautifully vicious dance.

She moved into a fighting position; Nami smiled, bit down a giggle.

&quot;Now dear...&quot; she began slowly, soothingly. &quot;It wouldn&#39;t be very wise to 
do that...two against one...not very good odds.&quot; She tsked sadly.

&quot;World Shaking!&quot;

A bright yellow planet of pure energy blazed across the stage, hitting 
Nami dead on. When the dust cleared, three Senshi stood at a distance.

&quot;I think the tables have turned,&quot; Sailor Uranus said, lowering her 
hands.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;We have a problem,&quot; Sailormoon whispered into her communicator. She 
squealed loudly and barely dodged the ball of white-hot fire that came 
her way.

&quot;A big problem! All um, un-present Senshi report to the park right 
away!&quot;

&quot;Do you mean absent?&quot; Rei quipped.

&quot;Whatever Rei! Just get here!&quot; With an indignant scoff, Sailormoon shut 
off the tiny device, waiting for an opening. The two strange women had 
to be distracted long enough for her to go in and save Mitsuki. Uranus 
and Neptune were doing a rather good job of keeping the duo preoccupied, 
moving with an easy, catlike grace that only they could achieve. But it 
would only be a matter of time before Nami and Ririko wore them down, 
for as well as Uranus and Neptune dodged, Nami and Ririko moved faster, 
hit harder.

&quot;Ohhh...this isn&#39;t good,&quot; the blonde girl whimpered, her eyes darting 
around frantically. She looked toward Mitsuki, who stood watching the 
battle with an uneasy expression on her face. &quot;I have to find out some 
sort of way to get her out&#133;but how?&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;She won&#39;t change.&quot;

&quot;She will, but not in the manner you think, Kazuki. Wait for it.&quot;

&quot;Who are those women?&quot;

&quot;Senshi. Our world, so corrupted, could not support beings with such 
beautiful auras. That is why we have the Children.&quot;

&quot;The Children are a far better option. Those silly things won&#39;t last 
long against Nami and Ririko.&quot;

A smile. &quot;You&#39;d be surprised...&quot;

&quot;And the other? You said she would...&quot;

&quot;Wait. She&#39;s forgotten, because she&#39;s never really performed such an 
action. She needs proper motivation.&quot;

&quot;Like what?&quot;

&quot;Danger.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Fighting them...&quot; Ririko grunted, parried a blow from Uranus&#39; Space 
Sword, &quot;is wasting time. Nami, split up! You know what to do!&quot;

&quot;Can you handle those two?&quot; Nami called back, already darting toward the 
stage where Mitsuki stood.

&quot;I&#39;ve dealt with worse! Just go!&quot;

&quot;Fine fine...bossy little thing.&quot; Nami clenched and unclenched her 
fists, and her nails clacked together, grew into long, dangerous claws. 
Shining scales burst out along her skin, her eyes narrowed into slits, 
glowed an unsettling amber. She grinned, but her teeth were as sharp as 
razors now, and twice as deadly. Finally, crystalline wings sprouted out 
of her back, glinting eerily in the light. It was oddly beautiful, this 
strange, alien creature.

&quot;I&#39;ll try to make this as quick as possible...it feels so strange 
hurting her, even if...&quot; She shook the thought out of her head, and 
moved like lightning, her claws glittering against the harsh Winter sun.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

It&#39;s like slow motion, Mitsuki thought dreamily, watching the Siren move 
toward her, with those claws...she had seen Nami like that before, 
watched her tear into enemies with an almost elegant brutality. The blow 
would be painless, the poison would move through her quickly. Nami used 
the claws instead of her other gifts, the harsh, drowning power of the 
sea, the maddening sound of her song. This, she realized with startling 
clarity, was to spare her pain. But why? Why would Nami hurt her? And 
Ririko...a false prophet? She was the light. They were supposed to be 
her friends, her comrades. She was the Hikari...she was...

It was close now, in seconds it would be over, she closed her eyes.

No...it will not end this way...

Now she opened her eyes again, and they were a pure, emerald green.

She moved her hands, and felt a rush of power, a familiar aura...but how 
could..?

&quot;Love and Beauty Shock!&quot;

She thought she was the one screaming, but it was Nami, writhing in pain 
as orange and yellow light exploded around her. She fell to her knees, 
and a Senshi stood behind her, pale blonde hair waving in the wind.

&quot;Need some help Mitsuki?&quot; Sailor Venus smiled brightly.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;How do you know my name?&quot; Mitsuki stammered, and she inwardly kicked 
herself. A terrific question to ask someone who just saved her life. And 
why was she blushing? Her entire system was out of whack.

&quot;Uh...&quot; Venus winked. &quot;I just know stuff like that. That&#39;s a pretty 
scary looking thing I just saved you from, huh?&quot;

Nami. She had forgotten. That attack the strange girl had given her had 
dazed her, but she would get up soon, Mitsuki knew it. And nothing made 
Nami angrier than having her pride wounded.

&quot;You have to run! She&#39;ll get up, and then...&quot;

But it was too late. Nami hopped up faster than Mitsuki had ever seen 
her move, and red bled into the amber of her eyes. The claws clicked, 
moved like a blur toward the Senshi&#39;s neck.

Mitsuki raised her hands faster than Nami moved, and pale blue light 
flickered, moved against the air. She moved quickly, hands glittering 
with otherworldly light, and punched Nami in the stomach, oddly 
satisfied at the surprised rush of air that escaped her mouth. Nami 
crumbled, gasped and bit back tears of pain. The scales across her face 
faded back into her skin, the wings flickered and disappeared in a flash 
of aqua light, her claws turned back into nails, and fangs regressed 
into teeth. She turned toward Mitsuki, deep blue eyes flashing in hurt 
and disbelief.

The light around Mitsuki shimmered, her hair unfurled from the odangos, 
a long sword, bright silver, appeared in her hand. Her outfit morphed 
into the long white priestess robes, a silver band held her hair back. 
Green eyes glinted, turned cold as she gazed at the Siren.

&quot;What is the meaning of this, Nami?&quot; Her voice was smoother, more 
controlled. &quot;This treachery, am I not the light of our world?&quot;

&quot;You kill me...&quot; Nami wheezed, &quot;and the others will come. They&#39;ll do far 
worse than a pity kill. You know the last level of hell in that dreadful 
poem Kazuki reads so much? Suejirou will do that, close you up in ice so 
thick so that you won&#39;t be able to breathe, you disgusting creature,&quot; 
she spat, still indignant, still proud, even as Mitsuki held the blade 
to her neck. &quot;You should be ashamed of what you&#39;ve done!&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about! When did this happen? Why are 
you doing this?&quot; Her voice wavered at the last words.

&quot;I am not the betrayer. You are the snake. But how long will you be able 
to hide in this garden?&quot; She stood, watched the tip of the sword without 
fear. &quot;Ririko! Let&#39;s go!&quot; With that, she vanished in a burst of aqua 
light.

The red fog faded, Ririko cursed, and faded off, leaving only traces of 
bright ruby light.

Mitsuki stared at her reflection in the sword, closed her eyes, and when 
she saw they were blue again, she promptly passed out.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;Wake her up.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t. How do we know what&#39;s going to happen?&quot;

&quot;Well, we need answers.&quot; Rei crossed her arms. &quot;What happened back 
there?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know,&quot; Usagi mumbled. &quot;She looked so shocked and sad...why 
would her friends do that?&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know...&quot; Minako said. They all turned when they heard a groan 
from Mitsuki.

&quot;But I guess we&#39;ll find out now.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;What happened?&quot;

&quot;I think you went Super-Saiyan.&quot; Usagi smiled down at Mitsuki, extending 
her hand. &quot;Let&#39;s help you up.&quot;

Mitsuki took the offered hand, standing on wobbly legs. &quot;I feel like 
I&#39;ve been through a blender...&quot;

Usagi laughed, supported Mitsuki as they walked off of the stage. 
&quot;You&#39;ll be okay. What happened to you? I heard that lady singing, and 
then, well, all of this other stuff happened...&quot; she feigned ignorance, 
rocking from side to side, &quot;I think the Sailorsenshi beat up those bad 
guys...but did you see them?&quot;

&quot;Sailorsenshi? What are those?&quot;

&quot;Super-cool pretty sailor suited soldiers of justice that kick butt!&quot; 
She grinned, stuck out her tongue. &quot;I like Sailormoon the best.&quot;

&quot;Sailor suits...&quot; Mitsuki bit her lip. &quot;I did see them. One saved 
me...her eyes were so blue...&quot;

&quot;Wow. Did anything happen after that?&quot; She gave Mitsuki a searching 
look.

&quot;Nami, she tried to hurt her, so I changed. I don&#39;t know how...I&#39;ve been 
trying to focus since I&#39;ve been here, in hopes that I might find a way 
home, but it just happened, and Nami, she said such mean things...Ririko 
too.&quot; Mitsuki lowered her head, and Usagi felt a pang of sympathy.

&quot;Those were your friends, huh?&quot;

Mitsuki nodded. &quot;I don&#39;t know what happened to them. They looked older, 
and...I just don&#39;t get it.&quot; She shook her head. &quot;And they argue so much; 
I can&#39;t imagine them working together so well, especially to hurt...&quot; 
She shuddered, pulled her coat closer to her. &quot;It has to be Umbra,&quot; she 
said, her eyes glittering with new resolve. &quot;It has to be her...she&#39;s 
doing something to them.&quot; She clenched her fist. &quot;When I find her, I&#39;ll 
make her pay for hurting my friends....I promise.&quot;

Usagi put a comforting hand on her shoulder, and they both walked home 
together.

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

&quot;I told you. When dealing with a threat, she changed.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t believe...fascinating,&quot; Kazuki whispered. &quot;And those Senshi...&quot;

&quot;Will be a problem if they continue to interfere. But we won&#39;t hurt 
them; they have no idea what is happening. When all becomes clear, then 
they will retreat.&quot;

Kazuki nodded. &quot;I suppose so. Are any of them particularly dangerous? 
They seemed to be a threat, but not a big enough one to worry about.&quot;

&quot;There is one...but I doubt they will put her in such a situation. She&#39;s 
too young. Rest easy, Kazuki, much more work needs to be done.&quot;

Kazuki nodded her head, and moved to leave. &quot;You take care of yourself,&quot; 
she said.

&quot;You too.&quot;

~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~*~~

Goodness. Hope you liked this chapter, and all of the confusion it most 
likely caused. But don&#39;t worry! Keep reading and it will be explained.

Note: The &quot;dreadful poem&quot; Nami referred to is The Inferno, one of the 
longest and most disturbing poems in existence. </pre>
