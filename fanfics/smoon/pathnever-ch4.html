<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>It was  dark and cold but a comfort lingered, one that could only come from  solitude, silence. Here I was alone, finding myself searching for  someone that died inside myself long ago. Where had she gone? Vaguely  my mind prodded a backwash memory. Now that I think about it, I  think…I think she disappeared with my parent awhile back. They all  abandoned me.</p>
<p>I felt myself exhale, there was a  tiny ‘blub’ sound as the air freed itself from the imprisonment  of my lungs. Slowly I opened my eyes, just enough to see the bubbles  rise away from my face.</p>
<p>It was the same as  last time. I am still suspended in and surrounded by water, water for  miles around. Many different shades, dark and light blue near the  surface, at least, I think that’s the surface. Light is streaming  down from overhead. I want…I want to break that surface.</p>
<p>I tried to move my arms but found they were bound tight  to my sides. They were still here I cursed mentally. Chains, of  different glowing colors clutched to me. Green, orange, yellow all  tried to shatter my feeble soul with their pressure. However, there  were two special chains. The glowing neon pink hovered around my body  slightly. It didn’t seem to have an interest to crush me but seemed  more intent on watching. The other, I could feel my facial features  twist in pain at the thought. The other, was a thin glowing aqua/gold  was embedded through my heart. All of them had been here as long as I  could remember…but wait…I searched through the surrounding  oppressors to find one missing! Earlier before I departed on this  journey there had been a red chain, but now it’s gone. Does that  mean…</p>
<p>Trying with more force I struggled  harder against the bindings. Get off of me I tried to scream but it  was no use.</p>
<p>Responding to force the chains  replied with force. Determined to keep their hold on me they  tightened around my chest, forcing the air out of my lungs. I opened  my mouth to cry out but only muffled sounds and air bubbles exited. I  can’t breath! I shut my eyes tight together, tensing the rest of my  body in a last attempt of defiance until I gave out. Why did it  always happen like this? Why can’t I win? The aqua/gold chain  started to burn.</p>
<p>Limply I received the pain.  If I were crying at that moment I wouldn’t have noticed. A current  seemed to be awakening once more in the area as I could feel my boy  sway roughly inside the containment.</p>
<p><strong>Swish.</strong><br />
  Weakly I looked up towards the noise. It couldn’t be…A  figure was making its way towards me, someone was swimming. The chain  piercing my heart glowed bright aqua. This never happened before. My  mind rushed through many possibilities only to come up with no  logical explanation and so, I started to panic. One thing I did know,  as I was, I’m helpless in this position and state.</p>
<p>The swimmer had passed the halfway distance and I could see  him/her better. It appeared to be a girl, dressed in an odd aqua and  white sailor outfit. Okay, so some freaky stranger dressed in battle  attire definitely did NOT make me feel better. As she neared closer I  felt myself struggle harder with renewed strength. I didn’t want  this. Unknowingly to me the orange chain around my chest grew  brighter as well. Let me go she’s getting closer! I tried to  communicate to my binds. However they ignored my pleas and remained  silent, watching the stranger with caution.</p>
<p>She would be here in a few minutes. I clenched my teeth, ready for  a fight. There were more ways than one to lash out. The waters of the  area steadily grew more turbulent and the light shades of blue had  vanished. I glanced to the surface. There were quick flashes of light  every so often, reminded me of a thunderstorm. My gaze had redirected  back to the girl. Her face was like an open book I mused. Clearly she  looked somewhat exhausted, she has guts, getting to me would be a  battle with the weather as it is. But…those eyes. Where had I seen  them? I pondered the thought, ignoring the fact she was yelling to  me. Baka, you can’t talk underwater I silently scolded her.</p>
<p>In a sudden burst of speed she was in front of  me, staring me down. It was then that I could make out her features  clearly: aqua, shoulder length hair, aqua eyes…Momentarily I was  stunned but it passed as quick as it came. She extended a hand  towards me, intent on wrapping itself around my waist. Doesn’t she  see the chains? You can’t get me out of here I tried to scream in  frustration. With her other hand she shoved it over my hand and gave  me a ‘don’t bother wasting your breath’ look. How ironic…</p>
<p>Feeling a need for action the chains tightened  their grip around me once more. The pain was nearly unbearable. The  aqua haired warrior backed off for a moment and gave me a concerned  look, confusion apparent in her aqua orbs. Damn, she didn’t see  them. When she moved closer once more I lashed out. If she saw I  wasn’t worth it maybe she’d leave, there was no point in having  her trapped here as well. My teeth found their way into her stretched  hand. Some blood escaped the wound, I could taste the disgusting  liquid on my lips and had almost gagged. One move was all it took.  The girl recoiled back and countered. All I saw was a knee coming up  to my face through a squinted eye and…</p>
<p><strong>Thud.</strong></p>
<p><u>Return  to reality</u></p>
<p>My body felt warm…slowly I opened my  eyes, one after another. No longer was I in the quiet void, but I was  in someone’s living room. It appeared that someone had laid me down  and wrapped in multiple blankets on their coach. There was one other,  another black leather one that played twin to the comfortable one I  sprawled on. Slowly I scanned the room in depth with my aqua eyes. A  coffee table…I could reach out and touch it from here. Hard wood  floor, a fireplace that was lit up and in the corner there was a  grand piano…whoever it is, this person must be pretty rich. I was  comfortable and to tell the truth I wasn’t in a big hurry to leave,  at least until I met the owner of the place. I bet if anything it  would have something to do with that girl earlier. Maybe whoever  lives here could give me some information.</p>
<p>Once  again I searched the environment to keep myself occupied. It was  strange to be in such odd surroundings. Most of the objects that  scattered the room mentioned were in my school books back at the  palace. Looking back it really helped I finally understood.</p>
<p>“I  guess Hotaru was right, those books really did come in handy.” I  smiled weakly.</p>
<p>My movements shuffled under the blanket  slightly. The clothing against my flesh felt fuzzy compared to my  usual attire. It better not be ‘princess’ shit, wrinkling my face  up at the thought. Finally I wriggled my right hand loose of the  quilts and peered at the clothing with intensity. Bunnies…I felt  myself sweat drop.</p>
<p>“Like the pajamas?” Came a velvet  voice, she was laughing.</p>
<p>I did not jump or even feel  startled, perhaps a bit humiliated. My eyes followed the voice until  I peered into another set of eyes, almost as though I were looking  into a mirror, I saw my own aqua eyes reflected back at me.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV, what happened in her  perspective</u></p>
<p>She sure was difficult to retrieve,  fighting in the water like some possessed demon. For a moment I felt  slightly guilty to knocking her out with a blow to the head but if I  hadn’t she’d have drowned. Besides, she bit me! It really did  hurt.</p>
<p>I felt myself sigh as I looked down to  the girl that I held. She was shivering in my arms. The two of us  were soaked and cold, just great. Hauling her up to my room proved to  be a challenge itself, for a kid she seemed to be a bit taller than  me, although, not as tall as Haruka I noted. And certainly not as  heavy as Haruka I giggled. Haruka…I wonder if she’s all right  now, if her mission went well.</p>
<p>Once upstairs I turned my  attention to the stranger’s soaked body. Her muscles were slightly  muscular I noted in interest, maybe she plays sports? Haruka would  get along with her very well, they’d make great friends…no I’m  not jealous!</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to for me to  change the girl out of her sweater and shorts. The heavy clothing  each dropped to the floor with a thud. I walked over to my dressed  and picked out a kawaii pair of bunny pajamas, I’m sure she’ll  love it, most kids her age usually do. She looks about fifteen if I  had to guess. I’m almost embarrassed to admit that I wore such  sleeping attire a few years ago myself. Feeling a slight blush creep  across my features I shook my head in defiance. So what, I thought  they were cute! I must be going crazy, living by myself this entire  time must be the cause of me talking to myself like a schizophrenic.</p>
<p>Feeling defeated in thought, I managed to change my own  clothes before taking the unconscious girl back downstairs to the  living room. It was much more spacious there, easier to breathe and  the fireplace provided the area with quick, comfortable heat.  Conscious of playing hostess for my guest I wrapped her in a bundle  of comfortable quilts, fluffy her pillow for maximum comfort. Kind of  cute how she looked underneath all that, innocent looking. Even  though she <em>did </em>bit me. I rubbed the bandaged wound sorely.</p>
<p>She seemed to be breathing rather heavily. I brushed my  hand against the side of one of her flush cheeks. A fever…I  frowned. In seconds I draped a damp, hand sized cotton cloth around  her forehead. Who knows how long it will take till she gains  consciousness, but I couldn’t leave until I had accessed the  situation properly. Questions such as who was she and where did she  come from were not only ideal and critical but necessary.</p>
<p>My  weary body rested itself onto a small, black hair in the kitchen one  room away, cautiously watching the small form. The chair creaked as  my weight shifted uncomfortably across it. The girl did look young…it  didn’t surprise me that she was taller than me, most people were.  Wasn’t my fault that I was short…But her hair…it reminded me  greatly of Haruka’s, the very same blond color. The only difference  really was its length, the longer strands of the strange girl’s  traveled shoulder length. My interest in this person increased with  each thought.</p>
<p>An hour later and my eyes felt themselves  slightly droop. I hadn’t slept at all despite the fact that all of  the swimming through the battering current had worn me out greatly,  almost forcing me beyond my limits.</p>
<p>“Yaaa…” There was a  soft yawn.</p>
<p>She’s waking up! It was so exciting; I wonder  how she’ll react. Pushing myself off my chair I moved to the side,  behind the kitchen entrance. Can’t have her seeing me so soon  right?</p>
<p>The girl’s movements were slow, opening  one eye than the other in a meticulous manner. There was a cute look  on her face when she peered at the room. I had to muffle my giggling  more than once. She looked so confused I almost couldn’t stop  myself.</p>
<p>My mind froze when she gave a weak  smile; what amused her, did she see me? My fists on the wall pushed  harder against the sturdy surface, holding my breath. No, it didn’t  seem to be the latter to my relief. Almost immediately the girl shook  her head, mumbling something I could not hear. What did she say? I  wish I knew…Huh? Now she’s wriggling slightly, the blankets were  shifting and, oh her arm. My eyes widened slightly, she managed to  get it out, I’m impressed.</p>
<p>Myself, I expected her to pull  the other free but the girl was staring at the bunny designs on the  pajamas. Her disbelieving reaction was hilarious, I just had to  ask.</p>
<p>“Like the pajamas?” I inquired, partially trying to  stifle another one of my giggles but failed.</p>
<p>She did not  look startled. Her eyes came up slowly and they finally met mine.  There was a familiar shock that hit me, threatening to buckle my  knees when I saw those eyes, the same aqua eyes from my visions, the  eyes that were burnt into my memory. No one said anything as we held  our gazes, neither willing to back down. The sound of a clock created  the only noise between us.</p>
<p><strong>Tick, tock, tick, tock.</strong></p>
<p>“I…”  She started, trying to find the right words she hoped to exchange.  “I…er…”</p>
<p>“You were lucky.” I helped. “You almost  drowned.”</p>
<p>“Drowned?” Her voice found itself but it was  barely a whisper.</p>
<p>“Oh, but no worries right? I mean, anyone  could drown in that stormy type of water, it was very strong  today…”</p>
<p>The blond chose to stay quiet, I wonder what was  causing her to lose herself in a stranger’s presence.</p>
<p>“I’m  Kaioh Michiru.” I tried, hoping to catch her attention. It did.</p>
<p>“Ah…ano…”</p>
<p>“You do remember your name don’t  you?” I teased. Her face broke out into a bright shade of red,  certainly not from her previous ordeal I mused.</p>
<p>“K-Kaiya…”</p>
<p>“Kaiya  san is it?”</p>
<p>She nodded her head. It didn’t look like she  was willing to say more so I didn’t push it. There was always time  later to gather the information, what was the point in rushing and  scaring the kid off? Kaiya looked up again. Something caught my  interest, she was hiding something, I wasn’t sure how I knew, but  her eyes…with all of the emotions that swirled in a disorganized  manner there was one that was excluded from the dance. My eyes  trained on the spot, it was very deep as I could only barely trace it  from the surface. She blinked and everything settled once more,  creating an impenetrable cover. I tried to hide my disappointment.</p>
<p>“Arigato Kaioh san, for all your help. But I should be  going now.”</p>
<p>“Matte. You’re still ill, should you not  rest first?” I had tried to keep my voice calm and even, hoping to  disguise the emergency of the situation.</p>
<p>She shook her  head.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>Michiru san seems  like a nice person, but I can’t let my guard down for anyone. I  know she wants me to stay…I do want to stay, the atmosphere is very  amiable, however that could all change if I don’t keep moving. It’s  getting worse, with every soul search I find it that much more  difficult to escape back to reality. Besides, I have a mission,  Hotaru is waiting for me back home!</p>
<p>“Gomen ne, Kaioh  san…I’ll be all right, please do not worry about me.”</p>
<p>“Are  you worried about your parents worrying about you? We could phone  them a-“</p>
<p>Michiru san was  watching me intently now. Should I tell her? Somehow, something told  me lying wouldn’t cut it with this person.</p>
<p>“I live by  myself.”</p>
<p>There was a concerned look on her face and it made  me feel uneasy. Almost frowning even in deep thought.</p>
<p>“A  young girl shouldn’t wander around at night alone…” She tried  to reason.</p>
<p>“I’m seventeen.”</p>
<p>“Sev-“</p>
<p>She  looked shocked, most people are I suppose. People like them often  judge a person’s age by their face…although I must admit… it  always amuses me seeing their surprised expressions. I could make a  game of it if I ever get bored. I chuckled slightly at my sense of  humor. Hotaru would slap me for playing with people’s minds though,  she said it was…<em>that</em> person’s specialty.</p>
<p>“I’ll  repay you someday, hopefully we’ll see each other again.” I  offered. Already I was out of the pile of blankets, looking for my  clothing. “Erm…would you mind telling me where my clothes are  please?” Asking sheepishly. My eyes shot open all of the sudden,  Hotaru’s gift! Michiru san seemed to notice my panic and sighed.  She made her way out of the room and came back with her arms full of  my now dry clothes.</p>
<p>“Ah! Domo arigato.” I repeated but  with relief. There was Hotaru’s pouch, clinging to my shorts still.  I held down the urge to snatch my clothes from the smaller teenager  in front of me. When she finally handed it over to me everything  inside raced with joy. At least I had one thing that was familiar to  me still. Thank Kami. My heart was threatening to beat through my  chest.</p>
<p>“You can change in that room over there.” Michiru  san kindly replied.</p>
<p>She pointed to a small room down the  hall.</p>
<p>“Arigato!” Boy, did I sound like a broken track  record.</p>
<p>Not wanting to waste more of our time I raced  off.</p>
<p><u>Michiru’s POV</u></p>
<p><u></u>I can’t believe  she’s seventeen! Was that a surprise…I shook my head. It’s not  safe to let the target walk out of here into the open but what was I  supposed to do? I was torn between keeping her safe and a possible  friendship. Haruka would yell at me now if she were here…the world,  finding the talisman’s were most important, aren’t they Ruka?  Ruka and I lived alone and both of us were seventeen. Who was I to  criticize another for the same actions I’ve taken? It would make me  a hypocrite! So much to think about, I didn’t want to do it  now…</p>
<p>“See you later Michiru san!”</p>
<p>I spun on the  spot just in time to see Kaiya waving goodbye and dashing out the  front door before I could react.</p>
<p>“Kaiya!” I called, but  she was gone.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s POV</u></p>
<p>I had been  running for awhile, it didn’t appear that Michiru san was following  me to my relief. It had to be done; I couldn’t allow myself to  become attached to people here. As soon as my task is over I’m  going back to the future. My fists clenched tightly and my strides  grew longer. The cold air felt good against my flushed face, I liked  the wind against my hair. My shadow jumped the street lamps overhead,  if I had stopped to look I would have noticed the stars in the dark  sky had come out.</p>
<p>Some time later I had made my way into the  city. It didn’t matter where I rested for now, a park would be the  best… it would be similar to the artificial forest back at the  palace. Reluctantly I smiled. This feeling of nostalgia was not like  me at all, but there was something about this place in time…that  seemed to bring it all back. Perhaps it was because they were  somewhere in this city, my parents.</p>
<p>Unconsciously I kicked a  crumpled can on the sidewalk. It rolled and clinked noisily and came  to a stop before I kicked it again. For awhile I tread forward, lost  in my own memory. There was no one around snap me out of my spaced  out trance, the streets were empty, nothing but the stars and the  head lights overhead watched over me. The occasional car would speed  by and disappear without a trace. The feeling was mutual; both of us  ignored the other’s presence.</p>
<p>I wondered, was  Hotaru watching me now? Impulsively my hand came up and slapped  myself on the right cheek, <em>hard</em>. This was stupid! I’m not a  child anymore I told myself. Get a grip, it was my idea to come here  and I’ll do this alone.</p>
<p>Somehow I managed to stumble into a  large park. Still grumbling to myself, I made my way up a few steps  and scanned my surroundings. Almost immediately a small continuous  creaking noise caught my attention. I looked across the park to see a  small figure on the swing set. It was a girl and she didn’t look  very old…If she hadn’t been swinging lightly I couldn’t have  known she was there. Everything about her camouflaged her in the dark  night. Short, dark hair and her outfit was composed of completely  black clothing. It reminded me of someone…I closed the distance  between us by half before to my horror, my foot snapped a twig. The  girl looked up surprised and I froze.</p>
<p>“H-Hotaru chan?” I  whispered.</p>
<p>Violet eyes stared into my aqua ones. But…was it  really Hotaru chan? I felt so confused; the girl looked like her but  seemed…younger somehow. The past… my jaw dropped, I was in the  past! I cursed myself for my brain’s slow processing speed, what  was it, one times ten to the negative five kilobytes per second!</p>
<p>It could very well be my sister but I’m seeing her as  her younger self, I had finally calmed down.</p>
<p>“What…did you  say?”</p>
<p>It was too late to take back what I said. Now I could  only wait for the girl’s screams of panic…but they never  came…</p>
<p><u>Hotaru’s POV</u></p>
<p>“What…did you  say?”</p>
<p>The stranger stood opposite to me, with a surprised  look on her face. How curious, ironic even that someone I’ve never  met would know who I was. Most people wished that they never knew my  existence. A sad feeling sweep throughout my weary body. My hands  gripped the chains of the swing tightly, the stranger was the exact  opposite of myself; blond hair, aqua eyes, tall…it left me feeling  envious. I could never see myself wearing shorts or a bright blue  sweater for the life of me either.</p>
<p>By the silence it didn’t  look like she was going to answer my question… disappointing  because I really wanted to know. Maybe I should go home now…The  school bullies gave up chasing me a few hours earlier but it felt so  nice to sit down while I caught my breath. So I stayed here, swinging  quietly to myself. People could always be so cruel to others who were  different…no one cared about my feelings, calling me a monster.  Maybe they were the monsters! Did they ever stop to think about that?  I was shaking now, biting my bottom lip to keep the tears from  coming. Perhaps the other girl noticed because she somehow made her  way over and stood in front of me.</p>
<p>“Daijobu des ka?”</p>
<p>I  shuddered to feel her hand on my shoulder, gestures of kindness were  foreign actions to me, no one but my father really cared if I was all  right or not. Before I could respond a rage of coughing fits hit me.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>There was panic in the older girl’s  voice, why didn’t she just mind her own business?</p>
<p>“It’ll…pass…”  I managed to respond within fits.</p>
<p>The worst of the attack hit  me now. My muscles recoiled from the spasms with pain. It faltered  and came back stronger with each attack wave. Too much… to keep  balance. Falling forward I expected to hit the concrete but met a  surprise when soft arms cradled me.</p>
<p>“This doesn’t look  good…” She muttered. “The hospital…damn I don’t know where  it is! Do you?”</p>
<p>It was no use, I couldn’t respond back  now. My weakened body could barely keep myself conscious let along  stand or talk. A soft sound caught my attention. Staring at the  ground I found the tears were coming now, they still came despite my  promise not to cry anymore. I hated myself, what’s the point of  existing like this? At times I knew I wasn’t myself. It wasn’t  just me in this body…</p>
<p>I felt the blond lift me with strong  arms, holding me close.</p>
<p>“Maybe we should try to find a  place…” She contemplated.</p>
<p>Realization had sunk in, I  didn’t know this person! Instantly I tried to wriggle out of her  grasp but she tightened her grip.</p>
<p>“You are in NO condition  get out of here by yourself.” She scolded lightly, teasing almost.  A small grin lit her face. It was amazing that I could see it in the  dark.</p>
<p>I shot a glare at her, even if I was wrong I still  didn’t like that idea. It seemed like there was no use arguing with  this stubborn person!</p>
<p>In moments we left the park, walking in  a general direction. There was silence for a good part of the walk. I  guess she must’ve been exhausted if she kept that mouth of hers  shut for so long.</p>
<p>“I’m Kaiya.”</p>
<p>Okay, scratch  that.</p>
<p>“Tomoe, Hotaru. But I guess you already knew that.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha…”</p>
<p>Why was she laughing, was I really  that amusing? I could feel my cheeks burn up, if I had the strength  I’d slap this girl and knock some sense into her.</p>
<p>“Well…yes  and no, Hotaru chan.”</p>
<p>“Ano…why do you keep calling me  Hotaru chan? I don’t really know you.” It wasn’t that I minded  really, just odd.</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“That can be  fixed ne?” She frowned in mock thinking. “What’s your favorite  color?”</p>
<p>What a question! Any idiot would be able to tell f  at first glance. I gaped at her. Are blonds really this dumb?</p>
<p>The  girl laughed again, apparently amused by the shocked expression on my  face.</p>
<p>“Black right?”</p>
<p>Tentatively I nodded my head.  We passed a city clock. I couldn’t believe how late it was! However  my attention was diverted once more when I noticed Kaiya’s shorter  breath intake. It never occurred to me that she could be getting  tired carrying me, she appeared so strong…until now that  is.</p>
<p>“Kaiya san, you need to stop.” I told her, finding my  voice. Her face was flush. I was no doctor but it didn’t look very  good.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.” My hand tightened its grip around a  loose part of her sweater. “Really.” She laughed. How can she be  so stubborn?</p>
<p>“You don’t even know where we’re going  Kaiya san.”</p>
<p>“You can just call me Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“Kaiya…at  least stop for a bit so we can get our bearings. I know you’re  lost.”</p>
<p>The blond seemed to agree; obviously the logic hit  home. In minutes we settled down on a pair of steps, there were many  trees all around us. It seemed to do her good, watching her more  cautiously her breathing finally slowed and she relaxed.</p>
<p>“So,  know where we are yet?” She turned to face me.</p>
<p>“Well…I’d  say we’re in front of the Hikawa shrine.”</p>
<p>My companion  raised an eyebrow sarcastically.</p>
<p>“And you deduced  this…?”</p>
<p>“There’s a sign.” Pointing a finger to a  small sign beside the blond.</p>
<p>“Oh…” For once she was at a  loss for words, I smiled. “Well… do you think it’s worth asking  if they’d let us stay for the night? It’s really late and I don’t  know if you would want to phone your parents this late in the night…”  Looking back at the clock down the street. “Er…morning.” She  corrected herself, scratching her head.</p>
<p>Papa wouldn’t be  able to come get me, thinking bitterly. He’s always so busy with  his work these days…It would probably be for the best if I stayed  and then call him in the morning and have that woman pick me up.  There was a spark of hatred threatening to swallow me up. It almost  did but a reassuring hand on my shoulder brought me back. Kaiya had a  concerned look on her face, the same one earlier in the park. It  boggled my mind, to help a strange, ill girl for no reason. I  really…hope she doesn’t find out about my powers…then  maybe…</p>
<p>“Come on.” There was that smile on her face again  as she extended her hand, offering to help me up.</p>
<p>I stared  for a moment and finally decided to take it.</p>
<p>“A-arigato  Kaiya.” The words came stumbling out.</p>
<p>“Ah, no problem  Hotaru chan! What are friends for right?”</p>
<p>Something inside  lit the darkness of my heart. She wanted to be friends, she said we  were friends! It wasn’t till that moment that I realized how much I  missed having someone there for me…</p>
<p>We walked up the steps  hesitantly. It was dark…a wrong step could make us fall quite a  ways. Kaiya insisted to walk behind me, she said if I fell she’d be  there to catch me. It was reassuring…</p>
<p>At the top of the  steps we paused. The place looked so mysterious at night, the way the  tree would flutter their leaves slightly and the wind howled softly.  The moon was being partially covered by the clouds, similar to being  in a horror movie. Kaiya took the first to step forward towards the  entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Knock, knock.</strong></p>
<p>We waited.</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p>I really felt sick, whoever lives here, I hope  they come soon. The whole adventure didn’t go down well with my  stomach. My ears pricked up when I heard footsteps. Someone was  coming out with a lantern.</p>
<p>“What do you want in this time  of-“</p>
<p>An short, old man had started to yell but stopped  short after the light hit Hotaru and myself. That look in his  eye…</p>
<p>“Oh ho ho! What’s a couple of pretty dames like you  doing here?” His attitude sure changed fast. “Are you lost?” He  elbowed Hotaru.</p>
<p>“Ah, something like that.” I felt my hand  pull Hotaru away from the perverted geezer. “We were wondering,  would it be all right to stay for the night until we-“</p>
<p>“Of  course!”</p>
<p>I didn’t get to finish my sentence and he had  already agreed. This could be a good or bad thing. My mind pondered  the idea for a moment, maybe this wasn’t such a great idea…but  seeing Hotaru shiver I couldn’t take back my request.</p>
<p>“Do  you mind sharing a room with my granddaughter Rei? Oh! Don’t worry,  she doesn’t bite or anything like that, she just feels a bit  ill…Yuuchiro is out of town and to tell the truth I can’t watch  her…”</p>
<p>I was getting what he was trying to say. If we  watched over Rei, we could stay the night.</p>
<p>“All right.”</p>
<p>He  blinked.</p>
<p>“Ya mean it?” He seemed to be the most serious  he’d been since the start of the conversation.</p>
<p>“Hai.” I  repeated in annoyance. Some of it was from impatience, feeling ill  yourself could do that to you.</p>
<p>“GREAT!” Kami, praise be to  fast reflexes, I had barely shifted to the side and missed his flying  hug.</p>
<p>“Come on Hotaru…” I muttered, taking her hand as we  walked towards the shrine, her eyes watched the old geezer sprawled  on the floor still while we walked away, wondering what to do. She  followed me of course.</p>
<p>“Wait, I have to show you where to  go!” He finally recovered, jumping up and sprinted towards  us.</p>
<p>This…was going to be a long night I sighed.</p>
<p><u>Inside  the shrine</u></p>
<p>The three of us walked a few steps to a  small sliding door. When the old man opened it a feeling of  nervousness hit me. There was a small body to the corner of the room,  wrapped in a futon. The blanket on the girl’s chest moved up and  down in a steady rhythm I noted. She seemed to be sleeping  peacefully.</p>
<p>“There’s an extra futon in the closet to your  right.” The old man informed me.</p>
<p>“Oh, arigato…” I  sent him a questioning look.</p>
<p>“Just call my grandpa!” He  smiled.</p>
<p>It seemed to be genuine, his smile. I was surprised  at first at how he was willing to let us take care of his  granddaughter…Not like I was going to do anything bad to her but we  were still strangers. My thoughts were interrupted when Hotaru pulled  gently on my sweater, she was practically leaning against me for  support now, rubbing her sleepy eyes.</p>
<p>“Your sister?”  Inquired the man thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“Something…like  that…‘grandpa’.” I added.</p>
<p>His face seemed to soften  from its usual tense perverted gaze. He seemed to leave it at that  and nodded his head.</p>
<p>When he finally left I let  Hotaru sit on the floor still barely conscious. Tip toeing I crept  over to the closet and found the extra futon. There was only  one…Guess I’m sleeping on the floor. It would probably be best to  lie it beside that Rei person, that way I’d be able to watch them  both without much trouble.</p>
<p>In minutes the futon  was laid out and I tucked Hotaru into the sheets. She looks really  relaxed when she sleeps. Her older self was always so tense and…well  acted like she had a stick up her ass. Somehow I surpressed a snort.</p>
<p>The room was fairly empty, except for the small table and  drawer. Soon I was propped up against the drawer, still observing the  two sleeping forms. It didn’t bother me that I was tired, I just  felt I needed to be wary. The place was still strange to me.  Unfortunately my body didn’t agree…</p>
<p><u>Rei’s POV,  dreaming</u></p>
<p><u></u>“Let me go!” Rei demanded.</p>
<p>The  monster had her pinned to a wall while the rest of her friends  watched on helpless.</p>
<p>“Rei!” They cried out to their  friend.</p>
<p>There was a black stream of light that hit the miko  in the chest.</p>
<p>“AHHHHH!” She screamed.</p>
<p><u>End  of dream</u></p>
<p>My body shot up into a sitting position only  to crash my head against something hard.</p>
<p>“Oww!” Someone  moaned.</p>
<p>I froze, there was someone in…my…room! A dark  figure grappled their head with their hands, obviously still feeling  the blow from our heads colliding. Rage replaced my fear, who the  hell did they think they were?</p>
<p>“What the hel-“</p>
<p>But  my cry was muffled when a hand covered my mouth.</p>
<p>“Mmf.” I  tried to continue angrily. All I had was words; my body was too weak  from the attack earlier to fight back. So I settled for second best,  using my long nails I scratched the intruder’s arms under their  sweater, hoping they’d release me. For a moment they didn’t move.  Didn’t they care? Finally after a moment they leaned in and  whispered,</p>
<p>“Please try not to be so loud…you’ll wake her  up.” They shushed me, taking their hand back.</p>
<p>Her? Okay,  now I was confused, who was…</p>
<p>“Ah-“</p>
<p>Two arms  wrapped around me, tightly, squeezing the air out of my lungs and  holding their hands around my mouth once more. My eyes darted back to  the sleeping form beside my futon. A short, raven-haired girl was  sleeping peacefully, only emitting soft sleeping sounds from her tiny  form.</p>
<p>“Shhh!” There was a pleading tone to the voice.  “Please Rei…”</p>
<p>“How did you…?” My voice whispered  warily.</p>
<p>The stranger pointed towards the door and stood to go  outside. I guess they wanted to take this outside, well fine then!  It’s not like I’m afraid of one person; I am the senshi of fire  after all.</p>
<p>Pushing back the sliding door I saw the figure  sitting on the desk with her feet propped over the side. She was  leaning back on her arms, bathing in the moonlight. Beautiful was the  first thought that came to my mind…</p>
<p>“You can sit down if  you want.” She motioned, patting a place beside her.</p>
<p>Still  cautious I hesitantly sat down. I could feel her eyes watching me,  studying me even. I wonder what she was thinking…</p>
<p>“Gomen  nasai for earlier Rei san.”</p>
<p>I looked up to meet a pair of  aqua eyes. They…looked so lonely. A weak smile played across her  face.</p>
<p>“Well, you see…”</p>
<p>It only took her ten  minutes to sum up her situation.</p>
<p>“So Hotaru…?”</p>
<p>“Is  the one sleeping inside, hai.”</p>
<p>“And my grandpa…?”</p>
<p>“Asked  us to watch you for a place to the stay the night in trade.”</p>
<p>I  couldn’t believe my grandpa was being so reckless! Leaving me in  the hands of a bunch of strangers I huffed. He’s so going to get it  tomorrow.</p>
<p>“He’s an odd fellow.” The blond seemed to read  my thoughts. Isn’t that supposed to be my specialty? No, wait…I’m  supposed to sense things. My eyes rolled at the thought. Well, there  wasn’t anything dark and evil from Kaiya…but the other  girl…Redirecting my gaze at the blond I studied her carefully.  There was a strange air to her… it didn’t seem to be quite  right…</p>
<p>“How do you feel Rei san?”</p>
<p>I blinked. The  pain and weariness all came rushing back to me. My hands instantly  came up to hold my throbbing head. Another hand pulled my head onto  something soft. A light blush settled across my face when I realized  Kaiya offered her shoulder as a headrest. Normally I would’ve  pulled back but I was too tired, pride could only do so much…</p>
<p>“It’s  alright…” Kaiya muttered softly.</p>
<p>It was  comforting, almost like having an older sister. My mom died when I  was young and my dad doesn’t give a damn. Grandpa is nice but…no  girl should trust him. I chuckled softly, thinking of the kind, old  man.</p>
<p>“Feeling better, Rei san?”</p>
<p>“Call me Rei.”  I mumbled. “And yes, I do feel better, arigato Kaiya san.”</p>
<p>“Call  me Kaiya.” The other girl replied, mimicking my voice in a teasing  way.</p>
<p>There was warmth in her voice, warmth from her shoulder.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t I seen you around before?” Feeling the  words coming out.</p>
<p>“Well…” She hesitated. “It is a big  city.”</p>
<p>I frowned, was she playing around with me? My  question was answered with a quiet chuckle.</p>
<p>“Actually, the  truth is…” Kaiya gathered her breath. “I’m not...from around  here.”</p>
<p>“Oh.” Oh, was that the best response I could  give? “So where do you come from?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere far away…”  There was a distant look in her eyes. Unconsciously I snuggled closer  to the girl.</p>
<p>“Was it just recently? I mean, you did say you  were lost and all.”</p>
<p>“You could say that.” She shrugged  with her opposite shoulder. “I’m here looking for  someone.”</p>
<p>“Someone…special to you?” I don’t know why  I asked or why I suddenly felt disappointed.</p>
<p>“My parents…”  Came the soft reply.</p>
<p>The feeling felt familiar to me, the  sadness she gave off started to seep to my core. Then…was  she…?</p>
<p>“They disappeared when I was little…”</p>
<p>“S-so,  how do you know they’re alive?”</p>
<p>Kaiya’s eyes  steeled.</p>
<p>“I know, believe m e.”</p>
<p>I did believe her.  There was something confident about her attitude, the certainty was  awe-inspiring. My eyes widened at another possibility.</p>
<p>“But  where are you staying then? I mean you aren’t exactly…” I had  wanted to say grown up but I felt myself clamp shut.</p>
<p>“Oh,  nowhere at the moment.” She laughed, the air tension broke and the  air relaxed again.</p>
<p>“But you can’t just go wandering  around!”</p>
<p>“So what do you suggest?”</p>
<p>I bit my  bottom lip. There was one idea that I had…</p>
<p>“Why not stay  here?”</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, grandpa probably won’t  mind.” He can’t say ‘no’ to pretty girls. “You’ll just  have to help out around here with the chores…”</p>
<p>Kaiya  seemed to contemplate the situation carefully.</p>
<p>“Why not?”  She smiled. “I’d be honored Rei.”</p>
<p>“You’ll also have  to deal with Yuuchiro when he gets back too.” I quickly warned her.</p>
<p>She gave me a quizzical look.</p>
<p>“He’s another guy  around here, helps out, trains…but he’s really useless.” I  sighed.</p>
<p>Kaiya’s smiled grew brooder.</p>
<p>“Sounds like  fun.”</p>
<p>She actually agreed! I felt so happy that I almost  fell asleep right there. I was slightly aware of Kaiya picking me up  and tucking back into my futon beside Hotaru. It was a surprise to me  that the girl could sleep through all the previous racket of my  panic.</p>
<p>“Kaiya…” Hotaru whispered.</p>
<p>Wearily I  glanced back up towards the blond. She didn’t seem to hear the  smaller girl and was sleeping against the desk with her arms crossed.  Sleep claimed me as well.</p>
<p><u>Morning…</u></p>
<p>As  expected Kaiya and I went to meet grandpa in the morning before  Hotaru awoke. He seemed to accept Kaiya immediately without any  problem at all. I wonder how Yuuchiro will react when he gets back? I  can’t wait to see the look on his face when I tell him he was  ‘replaced’, maybe he’ll start to actually help out around  here.</p>
<p>It was a funny sight to see…when Kaiya and I walked  back to my room Hotaru whirled around the corner and knocked the  blond over. She wasn’t crying but you could tell she was upset in  her own little way. For awhile there, Kaiya repeatedly patted the  smaller girl on the back, repeatedly saying ‘It’s all right  Hotaru chan…’.</p>
<p>After the little incident we called  Hotaru’s father and he immediately came, Hotaru talked to him for  awhile before they pulled up shortly…must’ve been through his  cell phone. I wonder what they talked about for so long?</p>
<p><u>Kaiya’s  POV</u></p>
<p>A small, black car pulled up down by the shrine  steps. When the door opened a tall man with whitish hair stepped out,  an oblique monocle covered one of the man’s eyes. Was there  something wrong with his eye?</p>
<p>While I stood there wondering  Hotaru ran past me and jumped into his arms, she was smiling and  looked happy. It was her father but not mine. I had overhead the maid  staff longer ago talking about Hotaru being adopted…I didn’t  care, she was still my sister to me…it was before <em>that</em> incident happened. An image of blood splattered across my  eyes.</p>
<p>“Daddy, this is Kaiya.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Hotaru has  said a lot about you.” He extended his hand as I took it in a  handshake. He seemed to be nice enough. When I glanced to Hotaru her  eyes averted my gaze. Cute.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet  you…”</p>
<p>“Tomoe.”</p>
<p>“Tomoe san.”</p>
<p>“I  can’t thank you enough for helping my daughter Kaiya san, she’s  always had a weak body…I hope it wasn’t too much trouble for  you.” Hotaru was still looking down, did she think she was a  burden?</p>
<p>“It was no trouble at all!” I exclaimed. With one  of my free hands I meshed Hotaru’s hair gently, leaving some ends  poking up at odd angles. Only a squeal of surprise was emitted from  the younger girl. Mr. Tomoe smiled, seeming to make up his mind about  something.</p>
<p>“Kaiya san, will you do me the honor of  accompanying Hotaru and myself for a ride? There’s something I  would like you to see.”</p>
<p>I glanced at Rei who didn’t seem  to mind at all.</p>
<p>“It’s all right. I have school. I’ll  catch you later afterwards.” Then she was off.</p>
<p>Then I  looked to Hotaru, Kami there was a pleading look in those violet  orbs, how can I say ‘no’ to them?</p>
<p>“I suppose…” Came  my nonchalant reply. Really I was dying to find out.</p>
<p>The trip  seemed to be quiet for the most part, even Hotaru seemed to be back  to her quiet, shy self.</p>
<p>“So I hear you just moved here, is  that right?” Mr. Tomoe asked.</p>
<p>“Hai, that’s right…but  how did you?”</p>
<p>I caught the exchange of glances between the  father and daughter. It clicked, Hotaru must’ve overheard me  talking to Rei last night. I wasn’t angry or anything, amused  actually at the younger girl’s reaction right now, her hands  wouldn’t stop fumbling together on her lap.</p>
<p>“I don’t  suppose you ever heard of Mugen Gakuen?” The man  continued.</p>
<p>“Well…ile, I’m afraid I haven’t.” I  reluctantly replied. I hated to sound so ignorant.</p>
<p>The man  only chuckled slightly and Hotaru…well she seemed somewhat shocked  at my response. This time it was me who was twirling my  thumbs.</p>
<p>“Why…do you ask Tomoe san?”</p>
<p>“Because  we’re here.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but stare at the tall  building and there were so many students…</p>
<p>“Come on, I’ll  show you around.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tomoe lead me through the hallways,  being sure to point out all the facilities the school had to offer.  It was really different from the palace, so many kids about my age.</p>
<p>“Our school has the best to offer, always trying to best to  accommodate the student’s needs.”</p>
<p>More than once I felt  myself unable to resist the urge of staring into the classrooms from  the outside windows.</p>
<p>“Sugoi…”</p>
<p>A teacher in every  room, many pupils interacting with each other. They all seemed  friendly to each other, made me jealous how much fun they were  having. As a child I was always alone…these people probably abuse  their luck.</p>
<p>The tour finally ended with us walking into a  large office.</p>
<p>“Welcome back Tomoe san.” The secretary  briskly replied upon seeing Tomoe san.</p>
<p>Hotaru’s father  smiled and waved before ushering us to follow him into a back office.</p>
<p>It was a big room, a white marble floor, a large desk by the  back wall…there were various paintings hanging from the walls and a  few pieces of extra but less important furniture such as leather  coaches lay throughout various places of the great space. Light  streamed into the room through back windows in the office.</p>
<p>Tomoe  san waved Hotaru and myself towards two small chairs in front of the  large desk. We were all seated comfortable somewhat, actually I was  nervous about what was going to happen next. Why did I get a full  tour of this place?</p>
<p>“You seem to be a person who would like  to get to the point of things…” Tomoe san observed. My muscles  all went rigid inside. “So I won’t beat around the bush. How  would you like to enroll into this school?”</p>
<p>Major brain  freeze. But it must cost a lot of money to go here and I didn’t  bring a lot with me…</p>
<p>“I…well…” Feeling myself frown  at he complication.</p>
<p>“If it’s money you’re worried about,  don’t worry, I’ll pay for your tuition.”</p>
<p>My jaw  dropped.</p>
<p>“N-nani?” I asked weakly.</p>
<p>Tomoe san  chuckled, at least someone found this amusing.</p>
<p>“Kaiya san,  if you haven’t noticed I own this school. It’s no problem at  all.”</p>
<p>“B-but I thought you said only the elite of the  elite and the really talented and whatever study here…” The man  doesn’t know me well enough to access any of my  abilities.</p>
<p>“Special people…” He mused. “My daughter’s  friend…I count that as being special enough.”</p>
<p>Out of the  corner of my eye I saw Hotaru blush.</p>
<p>“Unless you have other  plans…” He continued on, concern in his voice.</p>
<p>“Well…no  I don’t.”</p>
<p>“Great, then it’s all set.”</p>
<p>There  was a note of finality in his voice, so I said nothing more. It was  true that I didn’t have anything else to do or go really…and I  suppose this would make a great disguise, so why not?</p>
<p>Tomoe san reached over and contacted his secretary through a call  system.</p>
<p>“Would you please send Kaolinite down please? I have  someone that I would like her to escort.”</p>
<p>In moments a  woman in long red hair lead me out of the office.</p>
<p>“I’ll  talk to you later Kaiya.” Hotaru said, waving me off.</p>
<p>“All  right.” I nodded.</p>
<p>Roughly I was showed my locker and given  my school supplies. My dislike for the woman was already apparent to  me; everything about her rubbed me the wrong way.</p>
<p>“This is  your schedule and here is your school uniform.” She indicated by  shoving a day planner into my arms and pointed to a pile of clothes.  “Change quickly, faster you’re done the faster I can show you to  your first class.” She continued curtly.</p>
<p>Isn’t she a  peach? Bleh. Why do I get the feeling she wants to get rid of me?  Deliberately I changed into the blouse and skirt slowly. I didn’t  like skirts but this was going to be an exception. It wasn’t until  she threatened to come change my clothes for me that I hurried  out.</p>
<p>“Here’s your first class Kaiya san.” We stopped in  front of a steel door. “The teacher will introduce you and you’ll  find your way from there.” She knocked on the door.</p>
<p>When  the teacher came to the door the woman whispered something quick into  the man’s ear before speeding away.</p>
<p>“So you’re a new  student then?” The man asked, peering at me curiously. Was there  something on my face or something? There was something about that  grin…</p>
<p>“Hai.”</p>
<p>Nothing much to say about him,  black slacks, black suit…must be a dress code for teachers too,  many others wore the similar outfits in the other classes in the  tour.</p>
<p>“Well then, come on in and introduce yourself. Don’t  be shy.” He turned from class entrance and walked to the center of  the room. “Students, we have a new student, please make her feel  welcome.”</p>
<p>I could hear the loud whispers and mumbles from  inside. Suddenly I was aware of the situation, the sweat inside my  closed fists, how my arms were stiff by my side, the rigid muscles in  my back…and my breathing was too fast. Taking a deep breath I took  the first step and walked into the bright classroom, Kami there were  so many people. Talk about a cultural shock.</p>
<p>As I walked I  kept my eyes straight ahead till I reached the teacher. The whispers  buzzed around the room, greater than before. Spinning on the spot I  brought my steeled eyes up to peer at the surroundings. The students  were lined up in rows, slowly increasing in height from the bottom  up. It was when something caught my eye, no, someone. A certain aqua  haired teenager that I met earlier just poked her blond companion in  the ribs. So she went here, just great.</p>
<p>“Konnichiwa...”  The room fell silent. “Watashi wa Tenou Kaiya. Nice to meet  you.”</p>
<p>A silence rang in the air. I held my breath… did I  say something wrong?</p>
<p>The silence was soon pierced by the  shouts of approving students and I let out my held breath with a  ‘whew’. Guess they were in shock too, can’t imagine anyone  having a slower processing speed than me but I guess I was wrong.  Now…that was one problem out of the way…My eyes wandered back to  aqua eyes and blondie. Our eyes locked. Now for problem  two…</p>
