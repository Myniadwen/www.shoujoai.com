<h1>Kiss This</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kenneday.html">John deGraffenreid</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Ohayo Minna!! Well welcome to part three of my Amy/Lita series. I based
it on the song Kiss This by Aaron Tippin. I thought it was high time
Lita&#39;s ex Freddy got his come-upance. So here is my little offering. I
hope you all like it. As always its dedicated to my best friend
Heather, thanks for being my friend dear lady. Oh yeah this story
focuses on a girl/girl relationship so if you don&#39;t like that kind of
thing you may not want to read this. Enjoy all. Comments are welcomed

---------------------------------

It was their three month anniversary, a couple weeks since Darien&#39;s
death. Ironically it was also three years to the day that Freddy had
dumped her. She still remembered that night with a trace of bitterness.
Looking back it had been for the best, though she had found out why
Freddy had dumped her. Lucky for her Ken had been there to comfort her,
always acting as her big brother since she had no other family. Of
course that&#39;s how it had always been with Ken, then she met her angel
in blue and for the fist time that she could remember was in a happy
relationship. Lita was walking through the mall that morning trying to
find what she thought would be a good anniversary present for Amy.

She made her way through the various shops until she finally came to a
recently opened antiquities store. On a hunch she entered the store and
began to look around. When she got to the front display case she gasped
at the pendant she saw. It was an ice blue rose wrapped around an
emerald bolt of lightning.

&quot;Can I help you miss?&quot; a voice said, breaking the silence and startling
Lita. Looking up she saw a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a
simple pink sweater and blue skirt, she also wore a name tag that
identified her as Mia.

&quot;Uh yeah you could actually Mia.&quot; Lita said smiling. &quot;Could you tell me
how much the blue rose pendant is?&quot;

&quot;Of course, you have excellent taste you know, its an old piece.&quot;
Checking the computer Mia turned back to Lita and did the final
calculations. &quot;Well according to the price in the computer it comes to
about 500 yen. Though I could have sworn it was more than that
earlier.&quot; Lita took out the amount, surprised that she had just enough
to get the pendant and get it wrapped. As Mia started to wrap the gift
Lita took a moment to study her. &#39;She looks sad, pretty though. Not as
beautiful as Amy of course.&#39; she thought.

&quot;Excuse me Mia?&quot; Lita said. &quot;Uhm..this is probably none of my business
but could you tell me why you look so sad?&quot; Startled by this Mia looked
back at Lita and seeing genuine concern, smiled.

&quot;Oh its nothing, I had a run in with an old boyfriend last night. I
guess the hurt came back more than I thought it would.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry.&quot; Lita said. &quot;Actually that&#39;s why I&#39;m buying the pendant,
its my girlfriend and mine&#39;s three month anniversary.&quot; Mia was startled
by this for a moment, but seeing the girls openness reminded her of
Yuli. Smiling she handed the gift to Lita.

&quot;Thank you miss. I wish you the best of luck. Actually its my
anniversary tonight as well. Ryo and I&#39;ve have been seeing each other
for about two years now.&quot;

&quot;Very cool, by the way my name&#39;s Lita. Hey I&#39;ve got an idea! Amy and I
were going to go out tonight and celebrate. Why don&#39;t I talk to her and
see about making it a double celebration.&quot; Mia smiled at this but
gently shook her head.

&quot;Thank you, but Ryo and I have plans for tonight, something of a
tradition for us. Bring Amy here sometime, I think I would like to meet
her. Have a wonderful anniversary Lita.&quot; Lita nodded and quietly walked
out of the store only to bump into a the one person she hadn&#39;t seen in
nearly three years.

&quot;Hey Leets been a while hasn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Freddy?!&quot; Lita yelled. &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; She was obviously
angry and Mia frowned as she watched the passing events with interest.

&quot;What can&#39;t a guy go to a mall with out getting the third degree? Geez
Leets get a hold of yourself. Actually though, I got back into Tokyo
about a month ago, been trying to look you up but I never had any luck
up until now.&quot;

&quot;And just why would you want to see me Freddy? To try and get back
together? As if! I have someone now; get bent and goodbye!&quot; Lita stormed
off towards the exit so she could get as far away from the hated Freddy
as she could. Back in the shop Mia was very annoyed not only had that
jerk just made her new friend very mad, but then he turned right around
and had tried to hit on her as well. &#39;Oooohh! I think I&#39;ll talk to Ryo
about this jerk, I think he and White Fang would love the chance to get
at someone like this piece of slime.&#39; she thought.

--------------------------------------------------

Back at her apartment Lita was in the midst of fixing an intimate meal
for herself and Amy, the two, being sixteen, had gotten permission from
Amy&#39;s mother to move in together. It had been a rather bold step for
the usually timid Amy to take. &#39;Maybe some of me is rubbing off on her&#39;
Lita thought. &#39;I know some of her is rubbing off on me. I&#39;ve never
gotten such good grades. Guess we bring out the best in each other.&#39;
Smiling to herself Lita put the finishing touches on the dinner she had
prepared. Thinking back on the past few months she thought about
everything they had been through, all of it had only served to bring
she and Amy closer together. Lighting the last candle Lita went to
change into the forest green, velvet dress she had bought for just this
night, topping it off with a pink wrap and letting her hair down.
&#39;Perfect, she thought, almost the exact same look as when we first
kissed.&#39; Smiling to herself she waited for Amy to come through the
door.

-----------------------------------------

Amy had been having a hard time as well. She had gone shopping for
Lita&#39;s present earlier that day in another part of Juuban. In her case
she too found the antiquities shop where Lita had gone earlier in the
day. Entering the shop she found herself drawn to a pair of jade and
sapphire earrings in the shape of an ancient dragon. &#39;Actually&#39;, Amy
thought, &#39;It looks surprisingly similar to Lita&#39;s Supreme Thunder
Dragon. They&#39;re perfect for her.&#39; Seeing another customer Mia walked
out to greet her and see what she needed.

&quot;Hello there miss, welcome to my shop. Is there anything I can help you
with?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes there is actually, could you please tell me how much these jade
earrings are? I&#39;m looking for something as an anniversary gift.&quot;
Smiling to herself and seeing the colors of the dragon earrings Mia
deduced that this must be the Amy that Lita had mentioned.

&quot;Of course, let me check.&quot; Going to her computer Mia noticed that the
price for the earrings was obviously less than what it should have
been., but seeing as how the earrings were needed she overlooked it and
went back to Amy. &#39;I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be too much.&#39; Amy worried. &#39;But
they&#39;re just perfect for Lita. Oh I hope I can afford them.&#39; She looked
up to see Mia returning.

&quot;Well miss you&#39;re in luck, the earrings are on special today. Five
hundred yen.&quot; Amy looked relieved as she took out the proper amount and
handed it to Mia.

&quot;Oh thank you. You don&#39;t know how much this means to me.&quot; Amy said as
she took the gift wrapped earrings and left to go home. Smiling, Mia
turned to see Ryo standing behind her.

&quot;You did a good thing Mia.&quot; He said hugging her close. &quot;Now what was
this about someone hassling one of your friends?&quot;

----------------------------------------------------

Amy had just opened the door and saw the room filled with lit candles.
A trail of blue rose petals made a pathway to the dining room.
Following the path she saw Lita sitting at the table dressed as she had
been the night they had declared their love for each other. Smiling she
walked over to Amy and gave her a loving kiss.

&quot;Surprised my heart?&quot;

&quot;Yes I am. Thank you Lita, though you&#39;re spoiling me you know?&quot; Lita
chuckled at this.

&quot;I know, but I like doing things like this for you. Especially on a
night as special as this one. It was three months ago tonight you made
me the luckiest woman in Juuban.&quot;

&quot;Funny I thought I was the lucky one.&quot; Amy said &quot;But you are right.
Tonight is about spoiling each other.&quot; With that Amy and Lita each
handed the other a small gift box. Each also nearly fainted when they
saw what the other had given them.

&quot;Oh you shouldn&#39;t have.&quot; They said together. They embraced and sat to a
romantic meal, staring into each others&#39; eyes lovingly. After the meal
Lita cleared the table and went to Amy who had gone into their room to
change.

&quot;Are you sure you want to go out to a club tonight Lita?&quot; She asked.
&quot;If you don&#39;t its ok.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it my heart.&quot; Lita said. &quot;I&#39;ve heard some good
things about this club and I&#39;m a bit curious myself.&quot; Lita changed in
her jeans and usual white blouse to accompany it. Amy had dressed into
a blue skirt and light blue blouse. Wrapping her arm around Amy&#39;s
shoulder the two women walked out the building and down the five blocks
to the Sapphire Thunder, a recently opened night spot specializing in
various forms of music. The two found a table, talked and danced
together. As the song ended Amy and Lita went back to their table.
Sharing a quick kiss Lita excused herself to go to the ladies room. Amy
agreed to wait and sat smiling after her lover as the taller girl
disappeared into the crowd.

Unbeknownst to the happy couple, a certain ex-boyfriend had seen their
kiss and was fuming to himself. &#39;Oh no.&#39; He thought. &#39;So this is why
Lita blew me off. Well I&#39;ll show her.&#39; Storming off to the table he saw
the women at he waited until Lita was gone before he approached.

&quot;Hey there dyke.&quot; He said cruelly.

&quot;Excuse me?&quot; Amy said angrily. &quot;What did you just say?&quot;

&quot;You heard me fag. Who do you think you are? Lita is my girl. Just how
did an ugly thing like you manage to steal her from me huh?!!&quot; Shouting
now, Freddy grinned when he saw the tears forming in Amy&#39;s eyes.
Unfortunately for him the club had grown quiet at his outburst and had
grown very quiet. Quiet enough for Lita to have heard a familiar voice
yelling at Amy. Turning around Lita pushed her way through the crowd to
see Amy crying and trying to leave only to have Freddy push her back
into her seat and continue to berate the blue-haired angel. Clenching
her fists Lita slowly walked up to Freddy&#39;s back and lightly tapped him
on the shoulder.

&quot;What do you want?&quot; he said turning quickly only to have a very
powerful leg knee him in the family jewels. Dropping him to the floor
like a sack of doorknobs.

&quot;Freddy you piece of shit!&quot; Lita screamed at him. &quot;I&#39;m not now nor will
I ever be yours. You dumped me remember. You dumped me for another girl
and left me in the rain. Who in the hell do you think you are anyway?&quot;
By this point Amy had run into Lita&#39;s arms and was being held
protectively. Whimpering in pain Freddy tried to speak.

&quot;B..but Leets I was only trying to get back with you?&quot; He said, the
slyness oozing off his tongue like snake oil. &quot;I was a fool to ever let
you get away. C&#39;mon ditch the lesbo and let&#39;s get out of here.&quot; Lita
was on the verge of tearing Freddy a new orifice when she got another
idea. Smiling at Freddy in the most snide way she could she began to
speak.

&quot;So I guess you think this mean&#39;s we&#39;re just gonna kiss and make up
don&#39;t ya? Well Freddy I&#39;ve only got one thing to say to you about that.
Kiss this and I don&#39;t mean on my rosy red lip. Me and you Freddy,
we&#39;re through, and we always will be. So there&#39;s only one thing left
for you to do. Come over here one last time, pucker up, close your eyes
and kiss this goodbye!&quot; Covering Amy in a warm embrace she led Amy out
of the club to thunderous cheers. Freddy on the other hand was roughly
picked up by a large man and thrown out the back door of the club.

&quot;You can&#39;t do this to me!&quot; he yelled. &quot;I&#39;ll get you for this Lita! Good
grief I can&#39;t believe they took their side over me. I mean come on! Oh
well as soon as I start talking to my old friends I&#39;ll fix them all.&quot;

&quot;Excuse me, by any chance are you Freddy?&quot; a voice asked him.

&quot;Yes I&#39;m Freddy what&#39;s it to you?&quot; He turned to find a man in blazing
red samurai armor accompanied by a very large white tiger.

&quot;Good.&quot; The man said. &quot;White Blaze, sic him.&quot; All through the night the
people of Juuban would swear that they heard the screams of some idiot
being chased by a tiger.

----------------------------------------------------

Back at their apartment Lita held Amy for hours while the genius cried
her eyes out. She had always been sensitive but nothing had ever hurt
her like this. She knew she wouldn&#39;t be seeing Freddy again, at least
not if didn&#39;t value his life.

&quot;Amy,&quot; Lita said. &quot;I know Freddy hurt you and I&#39;m sorry I wasn&#39;t there
sooner. Are you going to be ok?&quot; Snuggling into Lita&#39;s arms Amy looked
up into her lover&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I will be Lita, please just hold me a while longer.&quot; The two held each
other long into the night. When Lita came to a decision. One that would
most likely affect them both for the rest of their lives. Of course all
she needed was a bit more money for the plan forming in her head to
work.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

That&#39;s all for now. Ja ne for now people.
