<p>“<em>You can't die on me, you can't!  You... You PROMISED!”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Promises... I'm sorry... but...  It looks like I'm going to have to break that promise to you.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>No! Not yet! You still have so  much to live for, so much to... Please don't die! I want to... I want  to live with you forever... and be happy.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I do too... and we will...  because you will find happiness with another... and I will be happy  from afar... because you are happy.”</em></p>
<p>There was a sudden infernally long  beep, and then the following message was produced. “<em>We are sorry  for the inconveniences but we interrupt the normal broadcastings for  an important news bulletin.”</em></p>
<p>“NOOOOOOOOOOO!”</p>
<p>“Oh shush, you big crybaby. And turn  it up.”</p>
<p>“You're so mean, Rei!” Usagi  returned while reaching over to turn the volume up as requested.  “That was a SEASON FINALE! It doesn't <em>get</em> better than that!”</p>
<p>Rei rolled her  eyes. Twenty years old with a grounded, loving husband and she was <em>still</em> the queen of dramas, both of the TV and of the  personality. It was almost depressing that she would eventually  become the queen of Crystal Tokyo, with <em>that</em> kind of  enthusiasm for pointlessly illogical mumbo-jumbo.</p>
<p>“Kya! ReiReiRei! Look, look! It's  Minako!”</p>
<p>Rei couldn't help  but flicker an eye at the news. <em>So she's come back huh? Well... I  suppose that's better entertainment to watch than Usagi drooling over  whats-his-drama-face.</em></p>
<p>It was just  starting to zoom in on a reporter and Minako. Rei flinched as she  took in how beautiful Minako had become... she hated to admit it, but  inside, she hadn't thought she could <em>get</em> much better.</p>
<p>Oh the woes and  torments of being wrong. However sweet they may seem.</p>
<p>“<em>Minako, it's your first time back  in Japan after an incredible success overseas. How does it feel?”</em></p>
<p><em>Despite the flashes of paparazzi and  fanatic cameras, Minako flashed them all a brilliant smile, a smile  that made Rei's heart clench. “It feels like home. And it's good to  be back.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Will you be staying here long?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>I just might. The schedule isn't  set in stone yet, so we'll just have to see.” She smiled again, and  no one would ever try to dig their feet in stubbornly faced with  that. Not even reporters.</em></p>
<p><em>Knowing this, her manager whistled  sharply, and then in the distraction broke through the crowd and got  Minako into the waiting black car.</em></p>
<p>The scene went back  to the main reporter, and then it soon went into commercials, before  returning to the interrupted scene.</p>
<p><em>That's their  idea of an important news bulletin? </em>Rei paused, and then sighed. <em>Well, I suppose it is, to viewers like Usa. And I think I heard  that her success has resulted in a lot of much needed donations to  the Japanese economy... personal ones that have really helped us when  some were really down on their luck... Her return to them would mean  instant extra pampering... I suppose.</em></p>
<p>“-Rei!” Rei blinked and looked up  at a momentarily peeved Usagi.</p>
<p>“What?” she asked  indifferently.<br />
  Usagi sighed. “Weren't you listening? We should  call everyone together and have a welcome back party for Mina-chan!”</p>
<p>Rei cringed at the  idea, though not enough for her companion to notice. She stood up.  “Do what you like. I have things that need to be taken care of at  home.”</p>
<p>Usagi stared in  surprise as Rei got up off the couch and started walking towards the  front. As she was putting on her shoes, Usagi suddenly ran after her  and exclaimed, “Rei-chan! Don't you care that Mina-chan's back?  She's been gone for so long! And she's one of us!”</p>
<p>Rei opened the door  with the same indifference. “I know. But she's a busy woman now.  There's no guarantee that she'll have a big enough opening to have a  proper party. She'll probably be attending an even bigger gala with  all those CEOs she helped out. She'll contact us if she wants to  contact us. I'm leaving, bye.”</p>
<p>“B...ye.” Usagi was put off, and  even a bit confused- no, a lot confused- at Rei's behavior. Wasn't  Rei the one who went with her whenever a new Aino Minako CD came out  in stores and helped her obtain one? Wasn't it Rei that gave Usagi  the change she needed if she saw a new poster or similar merchandise  but didn't have enough money with her? Wasn't it Rei that... reminded  Usagi to call up Minako after she had won that huge award, when Usagi  had meant to but then somehow let it slip behind in her schedule,  despite having watched the awards ceremony on TV? It couldn't be  helped that dinner was ready at just the moment she was going to go  call...</p>
<p>But that was beside  the point. Usagi trudged up the stairs, thinking about her fellow  temporarily retired Senshi. Had something happened between Mina and  Rei that she had somehow missed? Or...?</p>
<p>“I got it!” Usagi smiled  triumphantly, running up the stairs two at a time and tripping on the  last one. But she was still smiling as she looked for the cordless  phone. “Rei must be so ecstatic that she had to leave quickly so as  to not show it to me! I bet she's as happy as a bumblebee now!”</p>
<p>Usagi was not...  wrong, per se... so much as... presumptuous. She assumed that  bumblebees were happy... after encountering an invading bear.</p>
<p>As of currently,  Rei was fuming mad, at first at how she had to find out about her  return from the media, when she had been exchanging personal letters  and phone calls with the star ever since she'd left so many years  ago. And then she was fuming at herself for getting mad at such a  stupid thing. And after <em>that</em> she was mad that she always got  ticked off at the slightest things. She was a shrine maiden for  goodness sakes! She had had <em>training </em>to ward off this  behavior.</p>
<p>And yet... and  yet...</p>
<p>Knowing Minako was  in town brought it all rushing back.</p>
<p>Rei smiled.</p>
<p>She glanced around,  and acknowledged that no one was around.</p>
<p>She allowed herself  one more very uncharacteristic broad grin, and a single skip in her  gait, before resuming her normal neutral appearance.</p>
<p>The young ones at  her temple could tell the difference in her mood though. She knew  they knew, too, because they started trying to get away with things  they wouldn't normally. And she caught them every time.</p>
<p>When night fell,  Rei found that she couldn't sleep at all. She also knew that she was  so used to this fluttering in her stomach, the one that came whenever  something good had happened regarding Minako, that she would not be  tired come the next morning if she got less sleep tonight. So she  decided to be productive and do some exercise taking a walk around  the garden. It wasn't much, but it was better than lying down doing  nothing. That would only make her act strange in her skewed happiness  the next day. That was no good either. So she walked.</p>
<p>Her thoughts  traveled back to when Minako was last in Tokyo. When they had said  their short yet drawn out goodbyes.</p>
<p>“<em>Are you sure there's no trace  of... of </em>that<em>?”</em></p>
<p><em>Mina smiled, stepping up to her so  that they were only a few inches apart. “Quite sure. I had the  doctors check </em>three <em>times this last month, Rei. I'm completely  healthy.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Then... then why leave? Why can't  you stay here?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Weren't you the one who told me  to live as Aino Minako?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>...Yes...” Rei couldn't meet  her eye, still reluctant to believe that h- that Minako was going to  leave he- leave them all again. It was good that she was alive, but  at the same time...</em></p>
<p>“<em>Don't tell me you're actually  going to </em>miss <em>me, Mars Reiko-san,” she baited.</em></p>
<p><em>Rei snapped her head up and glared  for a moment. “</em>She <em>won't. </em>I <em>will though.”</em></p>
<p><em>They shared a smile.</em></p>
<p>“<em>I'll keep in contact with you  especially, okay? I promise.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Can I trust your promise?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Hey, I came back last time didn't  I?”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei looked away again. Sure you did.  After you died. And I went through a living-<br />
  “Rei.” Rei looked  up at the tone of Minako's voice. So sweet, so caring. “Will you  wait for me?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>No.” Rei grinned at the  expression on Minako's face at that, but relaxed into a smile. “I  won't wait for you like a dog without its master... but I'll be right  here whenever you need me, whether or not you set foot in Japanese  soil again.” And she did another uncharacteristic thing in the  spirit of the moment. She drew Minako close and hugged her. Not hard,  as if this would be the last time, and not soft, as if she was a  fragile doll that wouldn't be sturdy enough to return. Minako  returned the hug, after having her instant of surprise.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Not goodbye, not see you later.  But good night, Rei-chan.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Good night.”</em></p>
<p>In the morning, Rei  had found a bouquet of yellow roses on her doorstep. The note read,  “I will come back- I swear it. I'll always come back... for you, my  treasured friend.”</p>
<p>On the back, it had  her contact information. So if Rei didn't want to lose the  information, she had to always touch those words, that promise. And  vice versa.</p>
<p>She had called  Minako that very night.</p>
<p>And with a single  word, she realized just how much she would miss Minako from that day  forward, until they were reunited.</p>
<p>Rei stopped as she  came to a clearing, a lantern lit spot in the garden surrounded by a  ring of stones and flowers, with a bench and a small pond. She leaned  against a tree for a moment, remembering that this was where they had  said their goodbyes. Rei moved to sit down on the bench, recalling as  she sat and ran her fingers over the cold slate, all the times she  had spoken with Minako here, in their private corner.</p>
<p>“Mina... chan...”</p>
<p>A shiver of a  thrill crawled the length of her spine when she felt a delicate hand  on her arm, a warm breath on the back of her neck, and a heavenly  voice tickling her ear. “Yes Rei-chan?”</p>
<p>Rei whirled around  to face Minako. She was all that she was all those years ago, when  they had last <em>seen</em> each other in person. She was all that she  was during today's announcement.</p>
<p>And she was all  that she was in Rei's heart.</p>
<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>Minako laughed  lightly as she took the extra inch to sit down next to Rei. “I  don't see you for <em>how</em> long and that's all you can say?”</p>
<p>“Five years, three-hundred sixty  days.”</p>
<p>“You remember that well?”</p>
<p>“How could I forget? You left on my  birthday, of ALL days.” Rei frowned, remembering her supreme  annoyance when she first learned that.</p>
<p>“I said I was sorry for that, didn't  I? It was the only way everything could work out the way it had to  be.”</p>
<p>Rei said nothing  for a moment. Then she repeated her question. “Tell me why you're  here. Now.”</p>
<p>Minako sighed. She  had hoped she could break the ice a little more before telling Rei,  but she seemed so resolute...</p>
<p>“Promise to hear me out without  blowing it all off?”</p>
<p>Rei immediately  tensed in suspicion. “I make no promises.”</p>
<p>Minako nodded,  expecting this, and took Rei's hands in hers. Rei didn't object, but  she tensed up just a little more, though for a different reason.  “Rei...”</p>
<p>When she didn't  continue, Rei pressed, “What is it?”</p>
<p>Minako took a deep  breath, and then bore a look that connected soul to soul. “I need  your help, Rei. No, rather I should say, I need the help of Mars  Reiko. Without her... the Aino Minako of today will be lost.”</p>
