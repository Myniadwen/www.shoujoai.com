<h1>Mi Domando Se Li Vedro Ancora (part 19 of 21)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>The song is called &quot;The Unyielding Wish&quot; from the show Magic Knight 
Rayearth(the dubbed version of the song) . I don&#39;t own the song, Sailor 
Moon, nor Magic Knight Rayearth.

Ami groaned and shifted in her warm bed. It felt odd for her bare skin 
to touch her blankets, even tho she&#39;s felt the same sensation before.

She slowly opened her eyes and smiled softly as Raiga lay, facing her, 
still sleeping soundly, his long hair encasing his face. Ami raised one 
hand, gently brushing his hair back behind his ear. He was so cute when 
he slept.

Ami slowly pulled away from him and grabed his shirt from the floor and 
slid her arms thru it, buttoning it up as she made her way to the window 
to look outside.

&quot;Mom&#39;s not home yet,&quot; she said to herself, quietly. Ami ran her fingers 
thru her hair as she left the room, quietly going downstairs. She made 
her way to the kitchen, quitly moving around to get her a small glass to 
pour herself a cup of orange juice.

After pouring her drink, she sat at the table, sipping it quietly, lost 
in thought. Last night had been a sort of turning point for her. She was 
finally able to let Makoto&#39;s memory go.

Ami smiled, truely happy that she was with Raiga now. She sipped her 
juice more, hearing a soft groan coming from the hallway. She smiled 
more as she watched Raiga come around the corner, his jeans on and 
zipped, but not buttoned, his hair pulled back into a frazzled pony 
tail, looking quite groggy.

Ami giggled.

Raiga moved around the kitchen, making himself a pot of coffee, then sat 
down at the kitchen table, waiting for it to brew. He laid his head down 
on the table, going back into a sort of sleep like state. Ami giggled 
again and patted his hand.

&quot;Tired, baby?&quot;

He mummbled something that sounded close to a &#39;yes&#39;. Ami giggled a third 
time.

He raised his head and glared at her in his groggy state.

&quot;I am sooo happy I&#39;m amusing to you so early in the morning,&quot; he said in 
a gruff voice.

Ami chuckled, sipping her juice. &quot;Poor baby.&quot;

Raiga laid his head back down. &quot;Shaddap.&quot;

Ami smiled and gently rubbed Raiga&#39;s hand, the smell of coffee slowly 
filling the room. After a few moments, Raiga stood and began to make 
himself a cup, waking up with each movement.

&quot;Would you like a cup?&quot; Raiga asked Ami, looking over his shoulder as he 
stirred his own cup.

Ami shook her head. &quot;No.&quot; She finished her juice and stood to sit the 
empty glass in the sink. &quot;I need to get dressed tho and so do you. Mom 
will be home soon.&quot;

Raiga nodded and smiled. &quot;I could get dressed down here. All you have to 
do is give me my shirt back.&quot; He moved behind her, wrapping his arms 
around her waist and nuzzled her neck softly, and growling playfully.

Ami giggled and pushed him back and he stepped away chuckling.

&quot;Can&#39;t blame a guy for trying,&quot; Raiga said as Ami walked to the hall way 
and up the stairs. He leaned his back against the counter, sipping his 
coffee.

&quot;Raiga,&quot; Ami called out. &quot;Would you please come to the bottom of the 
stairs?&quot; Raiga nodded to himself, sat his coffee mug down, and walked 
out to the hall. He looked up the stairs but couldn&#39;t see Ami.

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot; As he mentioned her name, something soft blue in colour came 
sailing over the railing, landing on his head, followed by Ami&#39;s 
giggles.

He pulled the cloth off to reveal it as his shirt. He looked back up the 
stairs, Ami&#39;s head poked ever so slightly out of her room, still 
giggling.

Raiga smiled and tied the shirt around his waist, then let his hair 
down, shaking his head so his hair fell around his face like a mane, 
then began to slowly walk up the stairs on his hands and knees, stalking 
Ami. She only laughed harder.

Raiga stood as he reached the top and walked the short distance to Ami&#39;s 
room, where she stood, naked, seemingly waiting him to come to her.

He stood before her, looking onto her baby blues while she looked back, 
staring into his choclate brown eyes. Her hand moved up to rest on his 
stomache and gently played with the little &#39;love trail&#39; there. Ami use 
to think that men that were hairy was kind of gross, but on Raiga it was 
cute. Especially since he didn&#39;t have much, just enough so you can 
notice.

Ami smiled at him, then leaned her face forward, flicking her tounge 
around his nipple. Raiga growled softly and growled sharply when Ami bit 
him, then he purred as she began to gently suck on his nipple.

&quot;Ami...&quot;

Ami smiled up at him and tugged on his jeans pulling him inside her 
room, closing the door gently.

Makoto stumbled to the kitchen, the smell of bacon and eggs greeting 
her.

&quot;Morning, sleepy head,&quot; Minako called from the kitchen when she heard 
Makoto.

&quot;Oh shut up.&quot; Makoto stumbled to the kitchen table and sat down, her 
face pale.

Minako glanced over her shoulder at her lover, then back to the 
scrambled eggs in the frying pan.

&quot;Last night wore you out, huh?&quot;

&quot;Nothin&#39; I can&#39;t handle.&quot;

Minako sighed. &quot;Would you please train like Luna said before doing that 
again? You came home last night, looking like you were going to die.&quot;

Makoto grummbled. &quot;Felt like I was...&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Nothing,&quot; Makoto said. Quickly changing the topic, Makoto asked, &quot;Why 
aren&#39;t you out getting your hair done? Isn&#39;t your prom tonight?&quot;

Minako turned the stove off and divided the eggs onto two plates with 
some bacon and sat the plates on the table, one in front of Makoto.

&quot;No. Because of the gas explosion in the gym from one of the battles, 
the school had to find another place for prom. The only place they could 
find is the same place Usagi&#39;s school&#39;s prom is. Problem is, they&#39;re 
booked solid. So the schools worked out a deal and split the costs to 
rent the place. We&#39;re having prom with Usagi&#39;s school.&quot; Minako sat down 
after pouring her and Makoto glasses of milk and began eating.

&quot;Oh. So when&#39;s prom now,&quot; Makoto asked thru a mouthful of eggs.

&quot;Not sure. Three weeks I think.&quot;

&quot;Ah.&quot;

&quot;And Usagi bought Rei two tickets for the event so we&#39;ll all be 
together,&quot; Minako said cheerily.

&quot;Joy..You four never do anything alone, do you?&quot;

Minako giggled. &quot;Nope!&quot;

&quot;I believe it...&quot;

&quot;Whats with you,&quot; Minako asked. &quot;You seem so..cranky.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m just very tired. The battle wore me out,&quot; Makoto said.

&quot;You mean the transformation wore you out. All we did was stand around 
during the so called battle...&quot;

Makoto sighed. &quot;I&#39;m fine, Minako. I&#39;ll be fine.&quot;

Minako also sighed. &quot;I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m worried you&#39;re not going to have 
enough time to adjust to your new powers before another fight.&quot;

&quot;Well I&#39;m not about to just sit out of the battles until the rest of you 
get your powers. I can&#39;t!&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t yell, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said, gently laying her hand over 
Makoto&#39;s. &quot;I care and I worry. You&#39;ve been thru one hell of a year. Its 
a shock..&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ve adjusted fine,&quot; Makoto said in her defense, pulling her hand back 
from Minako. &quot;I&#39;m not a child, Minako. I can take care of myself.&quot;

&quot;I never said you couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;No, but you&#39;re insinuating it.&quot; Makoto stood and took her empty plate 
to the kitchen, sitting it in the sink. She walked back into the dining 
room.

&quot;I&#39;m going to take a shower.&quot; And then she left Minako alone to her 
thoughts.

As Makoto emerged from the bath, wet but clean and fully dressed, a pair 
of small arms clinged to her leg. Makoto looked down and smiled before 
picking Chibiusa up.

&quot;Hey there, sweet pea, how are you,&quot; Makoto said cheerily.

Chibiusa giggled and laid her head on Makoto&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m doing ok. 
I brought my tapes for us to watch today.&quot;

Makoto blinked. &quot;Tapes?&quot;

&quot;Magic Knight Rayearth! You said we could watch them today..&quot; Then the 
small child whined. &quot;Don&#39;t tell me you forgot, Mako-chan!&quot;

Makoto&#39;s face split into a smile, then she laughed softly, carrying 
Chibiusa into the living room. &quot;No sweetie, I didn&#39;t forget. I was 
teasing.&quot;

Minako smiled she stood from the couch and grabbed her purse. Makoto sat 
Chibiusa down and looked up at the blonde.

&quot;have fun with the girls, sweetheart.&quot;

Minako smiled. &quot;And you have fun with the munchkin.&quot; Minako winked at 
Chibiusa who only giggled. &quot;Bye Mako-chan, Chibiusa.&quot;

&quot;Bye!&quot; The two said together.

Makoto turned back to Chibiusa as Minako left, who was no rooting around 
in a duffel bag. After a few moments, she pulled out a tape.

&quot;Here&#39;s the first one, Mako-chan!&quot;

Makoto took the cassette from the child then popped it into her VCR. 
Makoto then turned the tv on, grabbed both remotes for them then sat 
next to Chibiusa on the couch. Makoto then hit the fast forward button 
after pushing play, moving past all the coming attractions on the tape.

Then Makoto pushed play for the opening theme, and as the music played, 
Chibiusa began to sing along with the lyrics-

&quot;Hold onto that dream!

Tomorrow knows where and when

It&#39;s true--what you believe

Don&#39;t let go--the road will never end!

The sunset melts into the deep blue sea

It turns a crimson shade

A wonderful free fall

I just want to have the wind

Take me faraway

I&#39;ve cleared impossible hurdles before,

But I know that there&#39;s more,

And I know I can make it

Who&#39;s to blame when it&#39;s not the best

That I can achieve?

Hold onto that dream!

Tomorrow knows where and when

It&#39;s true--what you believe

Don&#39;t let go--the road will never end!

Keep tryin&#39; to believe

The biggest part of you--

And now you&#39;re ready to go!

How much longer do I have to cry

Before tomorrow&#39;s light?

A night full of sorrow

All at once I found today

I&#39;ve finally hid my limits

I&#39;m sure that when you are falling in love

It&#39;s just like blinking your eyes

Before you know it, it flies away!

I just want to learn how strong I can be

When I&#39;m searching for love!

Hold onto that dream!

Tomorrow knows where and when

My lips&#39;re tightly sealed

But you can still see it in my eyes--

I&#39;ve traveled down that road

And found the greater love

This time I know it is real!

I&#39;ve cleared impossible hurdles before

But I know that there&#39;s more

And I know I can make it!

But when I got up to the starting line,

My legs were frozen with fear!

Hold onto that dream!

Tomorrow knows where and when

Reach out--unfold your arms

And take the key that opens up your heart!

Hold onto that dream!

Tomorrow knows where and when

It&#39;s true--what you believe

Don&#39;t let go--the road will never end!

Keep tryin&#39; to believe

The biggest part of you--

And now you&#39;re ready to go!&quot;

Makoto smiled down at the child as she sang her song. As the song 
finished, Chibiusa looked up to Makoto for approval and Makoto nodded. 
Chibiusa smiled and snuggled into Makoto&#39;s side, watching her show.

After a few hours, Makoto began to fidget. She could only stay in one 
place so long before the urge to run around screaming got to her. 
Chibiusa, on the other hand, was quite content sitting in the floor, 
munching on her popcorn Makoto had fixed for her only shortly before.

As Makoto sighed, a noise she did not expect to hear made her look up 
from the tv. Her wrist communicator was going off. Makoto blinked and 
flipped it open, Rei&#39;s face visable in the small window.

&quot;Mako-chan! We need your help. There&#39;s a battle going down near the 
crystal tower. We wouldn&#39;t have called you, but Usagi is wanting to go 
inside the tower to get rid of the men we saw yesterday. And everyone, 
except Minako, is postive we&#39;ll need your help!&quot;

Makoto nodded, then looked up at Chibiusa, who had turned to face Makoto 
when the communicator went off.

&quot;What about Chibiusa? I can&#39;t leave her here alone.&quot;

&quot;I know. Raiga is on his way. He&#39;s in his house cat form so when he gets 
there you get here!&quot; The communicator then went fuzzy as the connection 
was closed..

Makoto reached the background already transformed, but the youma battle 
was already over. Makoto could sense the approaching storm in the air 
and breathed in the rain scent deeply thru her nose.

She was already becoming tired from her transformation, only being 
changed for ten minutes or so.

Makoto, Sailor Jupiter, approached her friends and looked around.

&quot;No way in.&quot; It wasn&#39;t a question. She just seemed to know.

Mercury shook her head. &quot;We&#39;ll have to teleport in, I&#39;m afarid.&quot;

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Then lets do this and get it over with.&quot;

The group came together, taking one another&#39;s hands, forming a circle. 
Venus gently squeezed Jupiter&#39;s hand. Jupiter blinked but smiled faintly 
at her lover, grasping Venus&#39; hand back.

The senshi began to glow as their power began to emit around them. Their 
power began to come together and merge, forming around them.

Then the light exploded, and they were no longer there.

Artemis and Luna came out from behind a bush, and Luna sighed heavily.

&quot;They&#39;re gone...&quot;

Artemis looked at her, seeing the unshed tears in her eyes. He moved 
closer to her, rubbing his head against her&#39;s, purring softly.

&quot;Don&#39;t worry. They&#39;ll be back.&quot;</pre>
