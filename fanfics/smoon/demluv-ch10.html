<a href="../smoon/demluv-ch9.html">Back to Part 9</a><pre>BRIAREUS... an echo from the past

  Rei&#39;s communicator went off at around 2:00 in 
the morning. Ami appeared when Rei answered. 
  &quot;Juuban central park, hurry! You call Mamoru, 
and I&#39;ll call the outers!&quot; Ami blipped off. 
  Rei propped Usagi up with pillows and prayed 
she would be all right. She phoned Mamoru, and 
slipped silently downstairs. She hadn&#39;t wanted 
to leave Usagi&#39;s window open. She disabled the 
house alarm the way Usagi had showed her, and 
left the door unlocked. She darted behind some 
bushes and transformed. 
  Mars arrived at the same time as Tuxedo Kamen 
and Jupiter. Venus and Mercury had already 
gotten there, and faced a very confused 
hecatoncheires. 
  He identified himself as Briareus and demanded 
to see &#39;The Fair One who holds the power of 
justice&#39;. 
  Venus approached the huge monstrosity with 50 
heads and one hundred arms. Only with the aid of 
Ami&#39;s computer were they able to translate the 
ancient tongue, though. Venus spoke and asked 
him to state his intentions. 
  His many voices boomed. 
  &quot;The Fair One will free my brothers Cottus and 
Gyges imprisoned in Tartarus, so that we can 
exact our revenge against the Titan Uranus. I 
have captured some of the Titans as hostages and 
demand a trade.&quot; 
  Mercury stepped forward and explained gently 
that the one he sought existed in spirit only, 
as did all the other Titans. Their children, the
Olympians whom were their allies, ruled the 
planets and stars... also in spirit. The senshi 
were the last remnants of the immortals left to 
champion their world in physical form. As he 
could see, the one he sought was not there. They 
could not possibly go back in time and help him 
fight his war in Tartarus!
  Venus spoke again then.
  &quot;Go back to your realm, if you can, in peace. 
We have no quarrel with you, and do not wish to 
fight you and start a war no one can win. We can 
not aid you in your quest to free your brothers, 
for which we are truly sorry. Neither can we 
help you in your vendetta against the Titans.&quot; 
  The monster was enraged, and screamed aloud in 
his many voices. 
  &quot;Then I will destroy those who protect the 
Titans in the name of our mother, Gaea!&quot; He 
began to unleash his fury upon the Senshi.
  The outer senshi arrived just as the first 
blasts from the inner senshi hit the giant from 
all sides unannounced. The outer senshi added 
their greatest attacks into the fray, except 
Saturn, who used a lesser attack. 
  When the dust settled, the monster sat on the 
ground stunned. He blinked a few times and 
slowly stood, completely intact. 
  Mercury quickly analyzed his make up and 
instructed everyone to switch to Kendo versus 
magical attacks.
  The monster howled as the senshi quickly began 
to sever arms and heads with their swords. 
  Venus was sent flying, but excelling in 
gymnastics, she gracefully did a flip and landed 
on her feet, sword swinging. 
  Rei threw her ofudas in a fire soul attack to 
paralyze the monster, but he merely blinked... 
long enough for her to hack eleven heads off 
single-handedly, her countenance terrible to 
behold. 
  Blood sprayed everywhere. 
  Tuxedo Kamen wielded his sword mightily at the 
monster&#39;s midsection in an attempt to find his 
heart. 
  Uranus had dispatched about twenty something 
arms with the same alacrity as Rei. 
  Jupiter had meanwhile discovered, to her 
delight, the monster was not exactly immune to 
electricity. She repeatedly electrocuted his 
torso, between sword thrusts. 
  When his heart quivered in arrhythmia, 
Briareus screamed in agony. 
  Mercury sprayed her fog, and blinded him 
temporarily. 
  This allowed Tuxedo Kamen enough time to 
finish his attack. The monster&#39;s torso was cut 
in half, which severed the lower half from the 
top. 
  Briareus gave up his soul to Gaea, and died.
  The senshi used their powers to clean up the 
area. Rei burned the bloody remains, and its 
stench filled the air. Uranus controlled the 
wind to dispel the odor. Neptune and Mercury 
washed all the blood away. The senshi 
de-transformed, and began to leave the area. 
  Mamoru laid a hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder. 
  &quot;Where&#39;s Usagi?&quot;
  Rei shrugged his hand off with disgust and 
turned to face him. 
  &quot;I think if you truly cared, you would have 
bothered to call or visit her house. If you had, 
you would know she is desperately sick from some 
infections inflicted on her by a certain 
someone, and didn&#39;t have enough resistance left 
to fight off a simple cold. It moved right into 
her chest. When I left her, she had a fever of 
103&deg;.&quot; Rei backed away.
  &quot;I would call, but she told me not to. She 
said she would call me.&quot; Mamoru defended 
himself.
  &quot;I don&#39;t blame her. If you did to me what you 
did to her, you would be ashes right now. You 
don&#39;t deserve to breathe the same air she does!&quot; 
Rei hissed at him, &quot;but as it happens, some of 
the last intelligible words she uttered were to 
request that you and Setsuna pay her a visit 
together when her mother would allow it. 
  It was important, and she seemed anxious about 
it. I suggest you find Setsuna and be prepared 
to make a house call.&quot;
  Rei turned an icy glare at Mamoru. 
  &quot;By the way, while she may graciously forgive 
you and absolve you from any wrong-doing, I 
cannot. I promised, in deference to her I would 
not punish you. But I swear, if you lay one 
false hand on her, and I find out about it, I 
will hunt you down and I will incinerate you 
where you stand. 
  Don&#39;t ever touch me again, Mamoru. You sicken 
me.&quot; Rei turned on her heel, and sped back to 
the Tsukino&#39;s. 
  She left behind a perplexed and slightly 
embarrassed Mamoru. 
  When he looked around, he found himself alone. 
  It seemed Rei had become his rival, after all. 
He wished he hadn&#39;t obeyed that flat inner voice 
that had lured him to the Hikawa Shrine the day 
Rei had sought her soul mate in the fire. 
  He had seen the vision of Usagi adorned in her 
most regal attire. Rei had been faced away from 
the fire at the time, as she fought with a demon 
that resembled herself. 
  He had thrown his rose at the vision and 
wasn&#39;t sure Rei had seen it before it had 
dissipated. 
  He wished he hadn&#39;t teased her. 
  Mamoru was miserable. He had driven Usagi 
away, alienated himself from Rei, and had 
generally made a mess of his life. He wanted to 
curse his new power, but realized that while 
power was a part of him, it wasn&#39;t who he was. 
Just as the ginsuishou was not Usagi, and if she 
could learn to control and live with her power, 
so could he. So he blamed himself for his 
troubles. 
  Alcohol wasn&#39;t the answer, but it sure sounded 
good. 
  Mamoru set out to find Setsuna. 
  Meanwhile, Rei let herself back into the 
Tsukino&#39;s home, locked the door, and turned the 
house alarm back on. She went upstairs to 
refresh the ice bags and hoped Usagi still 
breathed. 
  Rei tentatively stretched her hand forth to 
touch Usagi&#39;s forehead, afraid she had gotten 
worse while she was away. She seemed about the 
same, and Rei heaved a sigh of relief. She went 
downstairs to refill the ice bags. 
  As she returned, Ikuko stuck her head out from 
her bedroom door and asked if everything was all 
right. Rei replied that she needed to stretch 
and refresh the ice bags... that was all. Usagi 
was the same. Ikuko seemed satisfied. 
  Rei dragged herself tiredly to the bed. She 
held her princess close to her chest and leaned 
upright against the pillows once more. She 
placed the ice bags under Usagi&#39;s arm pits and 
between her legs. Rei closed her eyes and passed 
out with exhaustion.
