<p>Rei felt an uneasy feeling settle at the bottom of her stomach. She  tried to ignore it, but no longer could as Minako started to notice  that the miko kept shifting in her seat. Makoto’s eyes were closed with  her hands folded. She was saying a prayer for Usagi to feel better  tomorrow.</p>
<p>Minako whispered to Rei, “Something’s wrong. You’ve been restless these past few minutes. Is everything okay?”</p>
<p>“I…just have a really bad feeling right now. I could be wrong.”</p>
<p>“Eh?  Rei, your intuition is always right,” said Makoto as she opened her  eyes. Apparently she had heard a bit of their conversation.</p>
<p><em>That’s what I’m afraid of, </em>thought the miko.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan. You have been acting very odd these past few weeks. What’s wrong?” said Makoto as she sat down.</p>
<p>Rei tried to dismiss Makoto’s concern, “I am not in the mood to discuss it yet.”</p>
<p>“Ah. I see. Why do you always seem to put your barriers up? We’re friends after all.”</p>
<p>“Makoto, like I have said before. It is a waste of time to worry about me.”</p>
<p>Makoto was a little hurt and annoyed by what Rei said. Before she could answer, Rei continued.</p>
<p>“It  is not because I want to push you away Mako-chan. If anything you girls  are my best friends, but you have to trust me. It is not me who you  should be worried about right now.”</p>
<p>Makoto sighed. She did not  want to get into an argument with Rei. The miko always had her barriers  up, and was always strict. She was a bit curious now as to whom Rei  referring to. Minako was eyeing the miko, knowing exactly what her  words meant. Rei had her hands clenched into a fist and she gritted her  teeth from frustration.</p>
<p>“Gomen Rei. I just care, you know.”</p>
<p>“I know, and I am grateful to have friends like the both of you.”</p>
<p>Minako stood up, “Well, now that this is settled. How about we go and get something to eat? I am starving.”</p>
<p>“Hai,” answered Makoto, “We should call Ami-chan to join us. She’s probably home by now.”</p>
<p>The  three girls were starting to walk out the church when their phones  began to ring. It was Luna on the other line, “Minna! It’s about Usagi.  I need all of you to meet me at the Juuban Hospital quick!”</p>
<p>“Hai,”  They all said in unison and began to run. However, Minako stopped them  and offered to take them there. On the way, they found Ami rushing  towards the same place. Minako ordered the driver to stop, “Ami-chan  get in!”</p>
<p>The girl nodded as she hastily ran inside the car. On the way to the hospital, Rei was overwhelmed with worry. <em>I was hoping that I was wrong. That bad feeling earlier was Usagi. </em>She shut her eyes tightly. <em>I hope she’s okay. No. She WILL be okay.</em> All four girls ran inside the hospital. Luna, in her human form, was the first to approach the girls.</p>
<p>“What happened? She was fine when I left!” said Makoto.</p>
<p>“Well,  she woke up and spoke to me for a while, but then she closed her eyes  again. When her mother came in, Usagi was not responding to her at all.  So, they called an ambulance and rushed her here.”</p>
<p>“But she is okay, right Luna?”</p>
<p>Luna stayed silent for a while, wondering what to tell the girls.</p>
<p>“Luna?” The girl could not answer them and stayed silent.</p>
<p>Rei punched the wall and everyone looked at her surprisingly. <em>Baka Usagi!</em></p>
<p>“Rei-chan,” said Ami as she worriedly looked at her friend.</p>
<p>All  four girls walked into the waiting room and took a seat. Ami’s mother,  Doctor Mizuno, spotted the girls and walked inside. Usagi’s family  later joined her. They all looked exhausted. Both Makoto and Minako  stood up and began to question the doctor. Ami slowly walked up to her  mother. However, Rei stayed in her chair. This was all coming too fast  for her and she wasn’t sure what she was feeling right now.</p>
<p>&quot;Minna.  Thank you for coming.” said Usagi’s mother. Shingo just looked blankly  at Minako, for he knew couldn't believe that the pop-idol was standing  before him. “We’re going to get some food. Would you girls like  anything?” They all shook their heads.</p>
<p>“We’re fine. Arigato,” said Minako.</p>
<p>“Mama,” said Ami. The doctor solemnly looked at her daughter.</p>
<p>“How’s Usagi?” asked Makoto.</p>
<p>“Gave us a scare for a bit, but she’s stable.”</p>
<p>“Can we see her?”</p>
<p>“Not tonight. She needs her rest, perhaps tomorrow you can all visit her.”</p>
<p>“Hai.”</p>
<p>Doctor  Mizuno’s pager went off. She looked at it and said, “Gomen, but I have  to take this. Ami, I’ll see you at home?” Ami nodded and when the  doctor left, the girls began to talk.</p>
<p>“I wonder what happened to  her,” said Makoto as they all began to walk outside, “She just had a  cold, nothing to be rushed to the hospital for. Her fever even went  down.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure, but this is Usagi-chan’s second visit to  the hospital in less than two months. Something is not right,” answered  Ami.</p>
<hr />
The girls drove straight to the hospital the next morning.  It looked like none of them got any sleep the night before. As they  walked down the hallway towards the Intensive Care Unit, they passed by  the pediatrics part of the hospital brought back fond memories to Rei,  for it was her first “concert” as Mars Reiko. It was the day when she  finally trusted Usagi enough to ask for her help.
<p>Flashback:</p>
<p><em>Usagi was observing Rei as she began to sang and once she was finished, Usagi sighed.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Is it bad?”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You got it but…Rei-chan…your face…is kind of menacing.”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei forced a smile, although she was disappointed.</em></p>
<p>“<em>Rei-chan…do you really hate taking part that much?”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei shook her head, “No…I’m pathetic…”</em></p>
<p>“<em>You’re just not used to it,” reassured Usagi.</em></p>
<p>“<em>That’s  not it. Asking Usagi and Luna to help me for something like this…” Rei  walked away for a bit, “If I do this, then I won’t awaken the power of  the soldier in me.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Rei-chan.”</em></p>
<p>End of Flashback.</p>
<p>Apparently,  it was Minako and Usagi who had faith that she would pull through that  day. Rei could only remember the words Usagi told her before going on  stage. She had felt nervous that day and slowly began to walk towards  the stage, when Usagi called out her name.</p>
<p>Flashback:</p>
<p>“<em>Rei-chan!” Rei turned around. Usagi ran towards her friend.</em></p>
<p>“<em>You  may not like it…but you’ve made me happy. Rei-chan, when you called  asking for my help…I felt like you started to trust me a little bit.”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei was confused now, “Trust?”</em></p>
<p><em>Usagi smiled at her friend and answered, “Well…you can’t rely on someone unless you trust them, right?”</em></p>
<p><em>Rei’s  eyes widened as she heard Usagi’s words. The odango-haired girl began  to wish her friend good luck. It was then that Rei realized that it  trust that allowed her to awaken as a soldier. </em></p>
<p>End of Flashback.</p>
<p>The girls were nearing ICU, when they bumped into Ami’s mother.</p>
<p>“Mama,” said Ami as she greeted the doctor.</p>
<p>“Ami. You girls are here early.”</p>
<p>“Well, we really wanted to see how Usagi was doing.”</p>
<p>“Ah.  I just came from her room for a few exams. She is a little weak from  last night, but fully awake. You girls can go on ahead and visit her.  However, one at a time. We do not want the room to be overcrowded.”</p>
<p>The  girls nodded in reply and walked down the hallway. There was a waiting  area with some chairs, and they settled in it, wondering who would go  inside the room. After a long silence, Rei spoke.</p>
<p>“I’ll go in  first,” said the miko as she started to walk towards the entrance of  Usagi’s room. Rei stood silent in front of the door, she was so unsure  of how she would react if she saw Usagi. Before walking in, a few  nurses push equipment inside Usagi’s room, and Rei couldn’t help but  feel an ache inside of her. She finally calmed herself and slowly slid  the door open. It was dim, except the light that shined nearby Usagi’s  bed. She heard the beeping and whirring of machines that surround her  and walked up to her friend.</p>
<p>“Usagi-chan,” she whispered. It was  painful to see her hooked up on machines and lie there helpless. Usagi  looked towards her Rei's direction and smiled at her.</p>
<p>“Not at my best state, as you can see,” she said weakly.</p>
<p>The  miko looked away, trying to hold back the tears that were forming. She  wasn’t sure but she felt a great deal of anger, rather than sadness.</p>
<p>“What a miserable face. Don’t be so sad Rei. I’m ok, see?” Usagi forced a smile.</p>
<p>“We both know that’s a lie,” said Rei finally.</p>
<p>Usagi simply looked at Rei and then down at her covers. <em>She knows. But this is Rei! She always knows when something is not right. </em></p>
<p>“Why?  ...Why haven’t you undergone the surgery yet? You know, you really  remind me of that time with Minako. She was also very stubborn.”</p>
<p>“Rei-chan.”</p>
<p>“She even joked when it came to the subject of her death. Just like, you.”</p>
<p>Usagi could not answer her as she stared down at her sheets.</p>
<p>“And  never once did she think that it would hurt me, no that it would hurt  everyone, when she died. I loved Minako, and I still do.” Rei could not  longer hold her tears back. “Did you ever think, that maybe life  wouldn’t be the same without you? Or that you are the reason why all  five of us are even together and alive today?! You are the reason  Minako and I were given a second chance with each other!” she choked on  her tears. “Usagi! Please. Take the surgery. I…I don’t understand why  you would choose not to!”</p>
<p>“Rei-chan.” Usagi looked at her friend  and began to cry. “I'm scared okay...I’m scared that once I go past  those doors for the surgery that I won’t come back. These surgeries are  risky, and why take it when I get the opportunity to enjoy the time I  have left here. Don’t you understand?”</p>
<p>“Baka! I said it to  Minako, and I’ll say it to you. Even if there is a slight chance of  success, as long as the probability is not zero….I’d take the surgery.  You have to keep fighting this! Fight to be with the people you love!  To have a chance at a longer life…with the people who love you.”</p>
<p>“I just don’t want to die on that table Rei-chan. So what choice do I have?”</p>
<p>“You  have a choice! You have the choice to live, despite the risk! I know. I  was scared for Minako when she was in this mess. But despite what  happened to her, I still have faith that you’ll come through. You’re  our Princess. You’re Usagi. Maybe a little accident prone at times, but  it makes you Usagi!”</p>
<p>Usagi laughed a bit and looked at Rei.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan. Always frowning,” said Usagi as she tried to mimic the miko’s frown.</p>
<p>Rei laughed too, a little embarrassed of the amount of tears she cried, and began to wipe her face.</p>
<p>“I  should go, everyone is worried about you and they want to come in too.”  Rei stood up and started to walk outside when Usagi grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>“Rei-chan. Arigato.” Rei smiled and nodded to her friend.</p>
<p>“Go on. I believe Minako is waiting for you outside.”</p>
<p>Rei  began to walk towards the door, but turned around,“One more thing  Usagi. Are you finally going to tell Ami-chan and Mako-chan?”</p>
<p>Usagi  was silent for a while and finally answered, “Hai.” She was nervous  now, for the odango-haired girl was afraid of the reactions she would  receive from the girls. Not mention, how Mamoru would react once word  gets out about her condition.</p>
