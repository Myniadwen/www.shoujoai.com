&quot;So how&#39;s your friend?&quot; Setsuna asked Juri quietly. They were sitting 
in the kitchen of the Outers&#39; house, enjoying their cups of coffee. 
Juri had come over to see her late last night, and instead of her 
going home they had spent the night together.

&quot;Sober,&quot; Juri smiled back wryly, &quot;a definite improvement.&quot; She drank 
from her cup, savoring the taste of good coffee.

Haruka and Michiru stumbled in, Haruka doing a slight double-take at 
seeing Juri sitting at the table. She opened her mouth to say 
something about Juri&#39;s rumpled clothes, only to be cut off by a swift 
elbow in the ribs from Michiru.

&quot;Good morning Juri,&quot; Michiru said demurely.

&quot;Morning,&quot; Juri raised her cup in a toast to the two of them.

Hotaru stumbled in, giving them all an absent minded wave as she 
retrieved her carton of orange juice from the fridge. A glass full of 
juice in hand, she wandered out into the living room to watch her 
cartoons.

&quot;She&#39;s taking my being here well,&quot; Juri noted, sounding just a bit 
nervous.

&quot;Hotaru usually does,&quot; Haruka agreed, &quot;I can only think of one or two 
times I&#39;ve seen her even mildly thrown off by something.&quot;

&quot;She&#39;ll probably have a few questions for me later, though,&quot; Setsuna 
noted.

Michiru groaned softly, remembering something.

When no explanation was forthcoming Juri asked, &quot;What?&quot;

Haruka smiled, sipping her coffee. &quot;Hotaru got let out of school 
early,&quot; she explained, &quot;and walked in on us while we were...&quot; she 
trailed off.

Juri blinked, then, &quot;Oh ho!&quot;

&quot;Exactly,&quot; Michiru was blushing faintly. &quot;Hotaru left as calm as you 
please, and we figured we were fine. A few days later she asked poor 
Setsuna what we were doing, and she described in detail what she saw.&quot;

&quot;Personally, there were some details that I just really didn&#39;t need to 
know,&quot; a blushing Setsuna said mildly.

Juri was still chuckling to herself occasionally when she headed back 
to the city. &#39;Wish Setsuna could be here beside me,&#39; she thought, 
steering her sports car expertly, &#39;but her nursing job keeps her 
pretty busy.&#39;

Juri returned to her apartment first, showering and putting on a fresh 
set of clothes. She looked much more businesslike as she strode out 
into the Shinjuku district, taking a short walk to a busy restaurant 
nearby. She picked out an early lunch, and polished it off in record 
time.

The calendar hanging on the wall caught her eye, and with a slight 
twinge Juri noticed it was nearly Mother&#39;s day. She remembered the 
tall, aristocratic woman everyone said she resembled. It had been a 
long time since she had actually seen her mom, a few months after she 
had been throw out of the house.

She knew it had been a difficult moment for them both, her mother&#39;s 
stumbling attempt at an apology, and Juri&#39;s own anger and resentment 
flaring up in return. She had said some harsh things that day, things 
that she regretted saying now.

The gift shop was on her way home, and Juri stepped inside to look 
around. The card was easy, a simply designed Mother&#39;s Day card, then 
she looked at the gifts. There were so many it was confusing, but then 
the chocolates caught her eye.

&#39;She&#39;s always liked chocolate,&#39; Juri remembered with a smile.

Chocolates, card, a nice box and wrapping paper, and Juri put it all 
together in the store. Deciding what to write on the card was the 
hardest part. After a few moments of thought she settled on a simple, 
&#39;Thank you, love, Juri.&#39;

Not giving herself too much time to think about it, Juri put the 
stamps on the package, wrote the memorized address, and had it in the 
mail in a few minutes.

It was too early to open the Locket, but Juri swung by the building to 
make sure it was still locked up tight. She stood in front of the 
building thoughtfully, considering what to do for the hours before the 
Locket was going to open.

&quot;Juri-sama!&quot; a happy voice squealed, and a young woman all but 
throttled her from behind.

&quot;Wakaba?&quot; Juri blinked, recognizing the curly haired friend of Utena.

&quot;I knew this place had to be yours as soon as I heard the name,&quot; 
Wakaba beamed. The girl had gotten a bit older, but other than that 
the perky young woman remained the same.

&quot;What are you doing here?&quot; Juri asked curiously.

&quot;I was in town visiting Utena,&quot; and Wakaba&#39;s eyes darkened a bit, &quot;had 
some time on my hands.&quot; She perked back up, &quot;I was looking around, and 
heard about this place.&quot;

&#39;Wonder from whom?&#39; Juri thought ruefully. &quot;We&#39;re not open yet,&quot; Juri 
said, &quot;but why don&#39;t you come in, look around?&quot;

&quot;Really? Could I?&quot; Wakaba was practically bouncing up and down.

Juri chuckled softly, opening up the front door. They walked down the 
hallway into the main room, the empty dance floor, the bar, karaoke 
stage and dining tables nearby. Off in the corner, the library and 
it&#39;s couches looked comfortable and inviting.

&quot;So what do you think?&#39; Juri asked curiously as they walked over to 
lean up against the bar itself. It was odd, but she found that it 
actually mattered to her, what this acquaintance from the past thought 
of Juri&#39;s bar.

&quot;It&#39;s incredible,&quot; Wakaba beamed. She looked over at Juri 
thoughtfully, &quot;And it&#39;s just for women, isn&#39;t it?&quot;

&quot;Yes, it is,&quot; Juri said gently. She poured them both a ginger ale, 
&quot;Are you really surprised?&quot;

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Wakaba smiled back.

Juri looked over at Wakaba, thinking about some of the stories that 
had been going around then. &quot;You weren&#39;t always joking,&quot; Juri said 
softly, &quot;when you told Utena that you loved her.&quot;

&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Wakaba blushed faintly, looking down and having some of her 
drink.

Deciding it would be cruel to push Juri took a different tact, &quot;Maybe 
you should stop by this evening, see what the place is like when it&#39;s 
open.&quot;

Wakaba smiled back cheerfully, &quot;I&#39;d like that.&quot;

They walked out together, Juri locking up the place before driving 
off. &#39;One more errand to do,&#39; Juri thought with a little smile.

Later that day, a visibly tired Setsuna drove home from a hard days 
work. Stopping at the mailbox she pulled out a large package, 
recognizing Juri&#39;s writing of her name.

&#39;What&#39;s this?&quot; Setsuna thought, flipping up the little attached card.

&#39;Happy (early) Mother&#39;s Day,&#39; the card said in cheery script. Setsuna 
unwrapped the box carefully, and sighed softly as she saw the 
chocolates inside.

&quot;Juri, you spoil me,&quot; Setsuna sighed happily, popping one into her 
mouth.

Characters this Episode: Arisugawa Juri, Wakaba, and Utena are from 
Revolutionary Girl Utena. And Haruka, Michiru, Hotaru, and Setsuna are 
from Sailor Moon.

Another &#39;Out of the Locket&#39; episode. A few fans were concerned that 
Juri and Setsuna might be breaking up, so I thought I should address 
that. I haven&#39;t dealt with Juri&#39;s family much, and with Mother&#39;s Day 
here I thought I&#39;d tackle it.
