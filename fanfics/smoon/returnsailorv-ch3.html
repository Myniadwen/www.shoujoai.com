<a href="../smoon/returnsailorv-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>THE HIGH SPEED CHASE 

&quot;Somebody Please!&quot; Sailor V shouted as the wounded police officer lied in the street 
struggling to breathe. 

&quot;Sailor V!&quot; A familiar voice said. Mina turned around to see another Sailor Scout standing 
before her. It was Sailor Mercury, but her eyes were covered by her blue goggles. 

&quot;Mercury?&quot; Mina asked surprisingly. 

Amy brought her finger to her lips. &quot;Codename: Sailor A.&quot; 

Mina had no time to ask questions. Sailor A simply crouched down beside the police officer 
looking at his wound. She pulled her computer out to analyze his condition. She sighed with 
fear. 

&quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; Sailor V crouched next to her and put her hand on Amy&#39;s gloved hand. 

&quot;The bullet&#39;s pierced his lung,&quot; Amy said. She slowly put the computer down and bowed her 
head. &quot;This is far beyond my knowledge of medicine.&quot; 

Mina put her hand to her mouth as the police officer&#39;s face grew more and more white. 

Amy pulled out her Sailor Pen and held it up. She looked directly into Mina&#39;s eyes, &quot;Only 
the power of Mercury may be able to save him.&quot; 

Mina looked over at the officer&#39;s downed motorcycle further down the road. It still 
appeared to be in one piece. Mina put her hand on Amy&#39;s shoulder, &quot;Do what you can Sailor 
A.&quot; 

Amy looked at Mina as she got up, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; 

Mina ran towards the motorcycle and picked it up. After fidgeting with it, she managed to 
get the engine running. 

&quot;Sailor V!&quot; Mercury cried out. But she was too late, Sailor V took off on the scratched up 
motorcycle and sped down Broadway. She rode it like a pro as she weaved in and out of the 
scattered mid-day traffic. 

Amy didn&#39;t have time for this. She knelt down beside the wounded man and looked him in the 
eyes. The man was brave, but not that brave. He knew his time was upon him as he struggled 
to breathe his dying breath. Sailor Mercury, or rather Sailor A, would never allow it. She 
closed her eyes and picked up her pen: 

&quot;In the name of Mercury, save this man&#39;s life.&quot; 

The crowd watched in awe as Mercury&#39;s pen shined. A mist of energy flowed from Amy&#39;s hands 
and surrounded the wounded cop. The longest 15 seconds of their lives ticked away. 
Suddenly, the bullet flew from the man&#39;s chest onto the street, his wound evaporated, and 
the man was able to breathe normally again. Sailor A had saved this man&#39;s life. 

&quot;Oh Thank God!&quot; Amy said to herself. 

Generic chatter erupted from the crowd praising Sailor A. The man was still in a great 
amount of pain, but not enough to where he could see the girl who saved her. 
 
 

The assassins&#39; car sped down Broadway almost running over every pedestrian in their path. 
The two men in black were quite satisfied with their actions. 

&quot;Well with any luck,&quot; the man in the passenger&#39;s seat said holding a bag of stolen jewelry, 
&quot;We should get to the border without any problems.&quot; 

&quot;And if there are any?&quot; The driver said. 

The other man laughed and picked up his 9mm. &quot;I got Ole Bessie here. You see that one shot 
I made? I got that fucking cop right in the heart.&quot; 

&quot;He wanted to get in our way,&quot; the driver said with little remorse, &quot;He got what he 
deserved.&quot; 

&quot;So as I was saying,&quot; the passenger put the bag down, &quot;I&#39;m at the club, and this crazy 
meatball-headed girl destroys the entire-&quot; He stopped as soon as he heard sirens creeping 
up behind him. He looked in the mirror to see another motorcycle cop behind them. &quot;Looks 
like we got company.&quot; 

The criminal reloaded his pistol. As he stuck his head out the window to get a better view, 
he could clearly see that was no cop chasing them. It was a blonde girl in a Sailor uniform 
with oversized red glasses. 

&quot;Fuck me,&quot; The criminal brought his head back into the car. 

&quot;What?&quot; The driver asked. 

&quot;I think,&quot; The assassin tried to gather his thoughts, &quot;That&#39;s one of those Sailor Girls.&quot; 

The driver was confused, &quot;Sailor Girls?&quot; 

&quot;You know, the girls with super-powers or something.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, you mean Sailor V?&quot; 

&quot;Yeah that&#39;s it,&quot; There was an uncomfortable silence. 

&quot;We shoot her God Damn it!&quot; The driver yelled. 

The passenger cocked his pistol and poked his head out the window. At this high speed it 
was difficult to land a perfect shot. Still, the shots from his pistol were enough to shake 
up the Motorized Sailor Scout. She began to weave her bike to evade the bullets. The 
criminal didn&#39;t rest. Bullets flew rapidly from his gun. As he emptied his clip, he came 
back into the car to reload. A couple seconds later, he appeared again out the window 
firing at the motorcycle. 

It was a huge shock when a bullet flew into the windshield and zoomed past her ear. That 
was close! Sailor V knew it was only a matter of time before he got lucky. She herself 
didn&#39;t have a firearm. What could she use? Duh! Her Crescent Beam of course. Mina simply 
pointed to the car and shouted, &quot;Venus Crescent Beam Smash!&quot; A beam of light flew from her 
finger and hit the door of the car just missing the assassin. As heat from the light nearly 
burned his face, the man screamed and went back into the car. 

&quot;Shit!&quot; The man said wiping his face off, &quot;That bitch is packing heat!&quot; 

&quot;She got an automatic?&quot; The driver asked trying to pick up speed. 

&quot;No you dumb-ass!&quot; The shooter said, &quot;She&#39;s got super powers! I can&#39;t-&quot; 

Another hit of her Crescent Beam shook up the car. 

&quot;Look just keep shooting at her. You got the cop-&quot; 

&quot;Forget it!&quot; The assassin screamed, &quot;I&#39;m not going back out there, I&#39;m not about to get my 
face burned off.&quot; 

&quot;You wanna go back to jail asshole? Kill the bitch!&quot; 

The assassin sighed and waited for another beam to smash the car. That&#39;s when he came back 
out to shoot the Superhero. The smoke and ash coming off the side of the car was enough to 
make him sick, but he managed to fire off a few shots. 
 
 

As the wounded police officer was treated by a medical team, Amy saw two cops about to 
chase after the assailant. 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Amy said knocking on the policeman&#39;s window. The window came down. 

&quot;Yes?&quot; The officer said, the name on his badge was Sirico. 

&quot;Sailor V went after those low-lifes. I have to help her.&quot; 

&quot;Listen kid,&quot; Sirico said, &quot;We appreciate you helping our fellow officer, but we&#39;ll take it 
from here.&quot; 

&quot;Please! I can track their car with my computer. I can&#39;t leave my friend behind.&quot; 

Sirico looked over to Officer Dante behind the wheel. Dante put his hands up as if to say 
&#39;Okay&#39;. Sirico looked back to the Sailor Scout, &quot;All right, get in the back.&quot; 

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Mercury said sweetly. Luckily there was no fence in the backseat so Amy could 
properly navigate. &quot;Okay just go down Broadway Northbound.&quot; 

Dante did so. Sirico looked back to the pretty soldier curiously. She turned her eyes away 
from the computer screen to look at the officer. &quot;Are you part,&quot; Sirico said, &quot;Of that 
Sailor Moon team?&quot; 

Amy was quite surprised to hear the officer&#39;s knowledge of the Sailor Scouts. She pondered 
quietly. 

&quot;In fact,&quot; Sirico continued, &quot;If it weren&#39;t for those goggles you&#39;re wearing, I&#39;d say you 
look exactly like Sailor Mercury.&quot; 

&quot;Yeah, I get that all the time,&quot; She said. 

Dante looked at Sirico as if he was nuts as the car rammed down the street. 
 
 

Sailor V was getting nowhere trying to smash the car with her beam. The criminal was still 
firing shots off. How many clips of ammo did he have? She tried something else. Her 
Love-Chain Encircled her as her motorcycle continued to speed down the street. She grabbed 
a hold of her chain and twirled it around like a lasso. A whip of the chain sent it flying 
right into the enemy&#39;s hands. He echoed in pain and dropped the gun to the ground. 

&quot;Yes!&quot; Sailor V said to herself. 

The criminal moaned in pain as he came back into the car holding his gloved hand. 

&quot;What the fuck is that girl on?&quot; He screamed. 

&quot;Where&#39;s your gun?&quot; The driver asked. 

&quot;Somewhere near 49th street.&quot; 

&quot;Shit!&quot; The driver pulled his gun out. 

Sailor V twirled her chain around again. This time, the chain blew out one of their tires. 

The driver&#39;s gun fell underneath the seat. 

&quot;Look out!&quot; The gunman screamed. The car almost spun right into the side of a building 
before the driver was able to gain some control and screech onto Columbus Circle. &quot;The 
Park! Take the Park!&quot; 

The car, it&#39;s front right tire screeching against the pavement, stumbled into Central Park 
nearly running over several civilians. Sailor V followed closely, now gaining on them. 
 
 

&quot;Okay,&quot; Amy said looking at her computer, &quot;They went into the Park. It looks like they&#39;re 
slowing down.&quot; 

&quot;All units,&quot; Sirico spoke into the intercom, &quot;Suspects have gone into Central Park.&quot; 

&quot;Come on Mina,&quot; Amy whispered to herself. 
 
 

Back in Tony&#39;s Restaurant, all was peaceful. Raye moved to another table where a man hid 
his face behind a newspaper. &quot;What can I get for you today sir.&quot; 

The newspaper came down to the table to reveal Martin Scorsese sitting down. &quot;Yes,&quot; his 
very recognizable voice said, &quot;I believe I will have Pastrami-&quot; 

&quot;OH MY GOD!&quot; Raye said star-struck. She dropped her pad and pointed to the director, 
&quot;YOU&#39;RE MARTIN SCORSESE!&quot; 

Scorsese&#39;s eyes vacillated, &quot;Uh yeah. Anyway I will have-&quot; 

&quot;I love all your movies!&quot; Raye said as she nestled up in the chair next to him, &quot;Taxi 
Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas, The Aviator-&quot; 

&quot;Yeah,&quot; Scorsese said uncomfortably, &quot;Well it&#39;s always nice to meet a fan.&quot; 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Raye said, &quot;Can I be in one of your movies? I&#39;m an actor! And I can sing and dance 
too!&quot; 

&quot;Well I dunno-&quot; 

&quot;Oh, and please let me have a scene with Leo DiCaprio. He is so hot! I may be a lesbian, 
but... He&#39;s Leo!&quot; 

&quot;You know what,&quot; Scorcese got up, &quot;I&#39;ll come back another time.&quot; 

&quot;Wait,&quot; Raye said as she followed him out, &quot;Please Mr. Scorsese I&#39;m a good actress! And I&#39;m 
not afraid to take my top off!&quot; 

Scorsese ran out of the restaurant. 

&quot;Wait!&quot; Raye screamed. She put her head down in shame. 

&quot;You could be in my movie,&quot; a voice from behind said. 

Raye turned to the man, &quot;Who are you?&quot; 

&quot;I&#39;m Michael Bay!&quot; 

Raye stared at him and slowly turned around towards the kitchen shaking with disgust. Bay 
watched her leave with sad eyes. 

Cooking can be a very boring job, especially when having to do it all day. So it was easier 
for Lita being able to watch TV while working. Of course, during the daytime, there was 
nothing to watch. The set was turned onto some daytime talk show. A fat woman sat next to 
her moronic husband with tears coming down her face: 

&quot;Biff, I have something I need to tell you. I&#39;ve been living a lie all this time. The truth 
is-&quot; 

The show was cut-off as a breaking news bulletin came up: 

&quot;And we have breaking news this hour,&quot; the newswoman said, &quot;A High speed chase is currently 
in pursuit in Central Park.&quot; 

Lita turned her attention to the TV while keeping an eye on the stove. 

&quot;The suspects are considered to be the ones responsible for the jewelry store heist this 
morning, and have already wounded a police officer.&quot; 

Lita shook her head in disgust but turned her attention back to the stove. 

&quot;The officer is expected to recover-&quot; 

&quot;Bean Burrito,&quot; Raye said as she left the order on the kitchen window. Lita didn&#39;t even 
look at the paper slip. She knew what she was doing. Raye went back into the restaurant. 

&quot;We have gotten word that the suspects are being pursued by Sailor V.&quot; 

Lita&#39;s full attention immediately turned to the TV. 

&quot;Sailor V is a Sailor-suited super-hero based in Japan, long missing in action, also 
rumored to be connected to the famous Sailor Moon and the Sailor Scouts of Japan. She 
apprehended a criminal last night in the East Village and is currently on an officer&#39;s 
motorcycle chasing the criminals through the Park.&quot; 

Lita completely neglected her duties as a chef and stepped closer to the TV screen in 
shock. 

&quot;Mel Croker has more-&quot; 

&quot;RAYE!&quot; Lita called for her friend her eyes still glued to the TV. The image changed to an 
ariel shot of the chase. She could clearly see that the girl on the motorcycle was indeed 
Sailor V. 

&quot;Elaine,&quot; a male voice took over, &quot;As you can see a lot of damage has already been done the 
car. Sailor V took out one of their tires, but they are still speeding through the Park-&quot; 

Raye entered the kitchen annoyed, &quot;What?&quot; She saw the food was left burning. Raye turned 
off the stove on the way to see her brunette friend glued to the TV set. &quot;Lita, what&#39;s the 
matter with you? You left-&quot; She stopped to see the headline: SAILOR V PURSUING SUSPECTS. 
&quot;What the fuck?&quot; Raye said as she turned up the volume. 
 
 

Sailor V finally got close enough to the car. She stood on the seat of her bike, trying to 
keep balance. The branch of a tree nearly knocked her off the bike, but her quick reflexes 
averted disaster. Mina looked closely at her target. She jumped clear off the bike which 
toppled over onto the grass. Mina flew through the air until she landed clear on the roof 
of the car. 

The THUMP was very noticeable as the thieves shook with fear. 

&quot;My God,&quot; the passenger said nervous, &quot;It&#39;s like we&#39;re in a HALLOWEEN movie or something.&quot; 

The driver swerved the car around as best he could trying to knock the monster off the car. 
Mina fell to her chest grabbing hold on the car. She held on with all her strength. 

The passenger looked up to see a set of gloved fingers holding onto the car. He poked he 
head out the window to see the girl on the roof. Mina saw the robber. He smiled and began 
to slam his fist right into her hand. Luckily she got her hand away just in time for the 
assassin to slam his own hand right into the hood of the car. The man screamed in pain. 

Sailor V jumped up to stand on the car, riding it like a surfboard. As the man&#39;s head 
remained in her view. She gave him a nice kick to the face. The assassin nearly fell out of 
the car. Mina&#39;s attention turned back forward as another tree branch sped near her. She 
crouched down just in time. Suddenly, her ankle was pulled knocking her onto her back. Mina 
reached her hands back to hold onto the hood of the car. She saw the assassin, now with a 
huge cut on his face, trying to pull her off the car. Her other heel hit the criminal 
repeatedly. He just wouldn&#39;t give up. 
 
 

The scene was just as intense on the television: 

&quot;Sailor V refuses to give up!&quot; Croker reported, &quot;This criminal is probably now wondering if 
robbing the jewelry store was such a good idea.&quot; 

Serena, with wet rubber gloves, walked into the kitchen to see her two friends glued to the 
television. 

&quot;Hah!&quot; Serena mocked. She walked right up behind them: &quot;What do we have here? Not doing our 
work? Sure chastise poor Serena for not doing her work, but we&#39;re just gonna watch TV. I 
just did all the dishes, all myself! Pretty soon I&#39;m gonna be running the place and you two 
are-&quot; 

&quot;Serena shut up!&quot; Raye scowled without looking away from the TV. 

As Serena gave the TV a quick look, she saw a familiar face on top of the suspect&#39;s car: 
&quot;Mina?&quot; She stared at the TV for a few more seconds before ordering her soldiers, &quot;Oh God 
we gotta help her!&quot; She threw off her rubber gloves. 

Lita finally looked towards her Princess, &quot;Yeah she&#39;s right!&quot; 

Tony finally walked into the kitchen and raised his arms: &quot;Hey! I&#39;m not paying you two to 
sit around and watch TV!&quot; 

The three girls started to run out the door. 

&quot;Sorry Tony,&quot; Lita said, &quot;Emergency!&quot; 

The girls were out of the restaurant before Tony could say anything. He stood there with 
his jaw dropped and looked up to the ceiling. His threw his hands up: &quot;I try to go legit 
and look what happens?&quot; 
 
 

The cop car rode through Central Park following the trail of damage left by the criminals. 
Suddenly, a motorcycle passed their way. 

&quot;That&#39;s the motorcycle?&quot; Sirico turned around to look at the vehicle. 

&quot;She&#39;s still moving,&quot; Amy said looking at her computer, &quot;They appear to be slowing down.&quot; 

&quot;Ah,&quot; Dante said, &quot;I see them up ahead. Looks like they&#39;re heading for the reservoir.&quot; 

Amy moved closer to the front of the car to get a birds eye view. The car was still moving 
at a notable speed. 

The assassin was so badly beat up, he could barely hang on to Mina&#39;s leg. With all her 
might, Sailor V gave the low-life a sharp kick to the face sending him flying out of the 
car bouncing onto the ground. 

&quot;Whoa!&quot; Sirico said astonished. The car came closer and closer to the suspect. Dante 
slammed on his breaks before running him over. Both the police officers grabbed a hold of 
him. He didn&#39;t even bother to struggle. Amy ran out of the car and dashed passed the police 
towards the speeding car. The cops watched her speed away as they apprehended the injured 
thief. 

Sailor V tried to regain her balance, but another swerve caused her to fall off the 
passenger&#39;s side. Her mask fell onto the ground, but luckily, she managed to swing her legs 
into the car falling right onto the passenger&#39;s seat. Within a split second, a gun was 
pointed directly at her head. Mina turned to see the driver smiling at her. Was this the 
end for Sailor Venus? 

It certainly looked like it, because Mina looked forward to see the car about to go 
straight into the reservoir. The driver saw it too. He tried to slam on his brakes, but it 
was too late. The two of them screamed as the car smashed through the fence. 

It was almost slow motion to Sailor Mercury as the car hovered in mid-air before falling 
face-first into the water: &quot;MINA!&quot; Amy screamed and continued to run. As she watched the 
car quickly sink into the water, Amy threw off her goggles, threw her computer onto the 
ground, and kicked her boots off before diving into the water. 

Amy could see very clearly underwater. She spotted the car easily and swam as hard as she 
could for it. Upon reaching it, there was no sign of her friend. The other criminal was 
floating behind the wheel unconscious. Amy swam into the car; still no sign of Sailor V. 
The man behind the wheel may have been a criminal, but Amy couldn&#39;t let a human-being die. 
She grabbed a hold of the man and brought him to shore. The man now safely out of the 
water, the water scout dove back into the murky water to find Mina. She looked everywhere, 
no sign of anyone. She came to the breaking point of her ability to hold her breath when 
she saw her. Sailor V was floating in the water with a cut on her forehead. 

Horrified, Sailor Mercury instinctively grabbed the blonde and swam as hard as she could to 
the shore. After what seemed like an eternity, Amy brought the girl to shore. 

&quot;MINA!&quot; Amy cried. She wasn&#39;t breathing. &quot;NO!&quot; Amy cried again for anyone around to hear. 
She quickly gave the scout CPR, trying desperately to revitalize her. 

The cop car finally made it to the reservoir, the other criminal hand-cuffed in the back. 
Sirico and Dante got out and watched as the blue-haired scout gave the blonde-scout 
artificial respiration. Sirico recognized the girl, &quot;Sailor Venus!&quot; And he could clearly 
see without her goggles that Sailor A was Sailor Mercury. 

&quot;Mina please!&quot; Amy cried as she incessantly kept trying to save her friend. Finally, the 
blonde coughed and came to her senses. She breathed normally within seconds and opened her 
eyes to see Sailor Mercury in front of her. 

&quot;Mina!&quot; Amy cried as tears of relief came down her face. 

&quot;Amy,&quot; Mina said working to catch her breath. 

Amy grabbed a hold of her friend and kissed her on the lips. A confused Mina retuned the 
favor. The two Sailor Scouts, completely drenched head to toe, made out in relief. Amy 
paused to hold her friend, her teary eyes closed: 

&quot;I thought I lost you.&quot; The two of them continued to kiss each other passionately. Amy&#39;s 
wet gloved hands grabbed the back of Mina&#39;s hair. 

Dante and Sirico stared at the girls without saying anything. 

Mina pushed her friend back, &quot;You know,&quot; she said, &quot;You could have just used your pen to 
bring me back.&quot; The girls laughed and kissed each other more. 

&quot;Ahem,&quot; Sirico cleared his throat grabbing their attention. The two girls broke their 
embrace slightly embarrassed. Sirico stood over them in full uniform smiling at the girls. 
&quot;As much as I&#39;d love to watch more of this, I think you two might want to put these back on 
before the press gets here.&quot; Sirico was holding Sailor V&#39;s mask and Sailor A&#39;s goggles. 

Mina brought her hands to her face, completely unaware that her mask had fallen off. She 
closed her eyes. 

&quot;Don&#39;t worry,&quot; Sirico said, &quot;You&#39;re secret&#39;s safe with us Sailor Scouts. Might I say it&#39;s 
an honor to meet the two of you.&quot; 

Mina put her mask back on and nodded in appreciation of the officer: &quot;The cop!&quot; She was 
reminded. Her attention turned to Sirico&#39;s eyes, &quot;The one who got wounded, is he all 
right?&quot; 

&quot;Sure is,&quot; Sirico smiled, &quot;Thanks to you two.&quot; Amy put her goggles back on. &quot;By the way, 
you two can continue kissing each other if you want, I don&#39;t mind.&quot; 

Sailor V and Sailor A looked at each other and rolled their eyes.
