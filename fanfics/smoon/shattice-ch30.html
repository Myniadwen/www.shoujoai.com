<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 30 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch29.html">Back to Part 29</a><pre>&quot;Raaar!&quot; the massively muscled figure yelled, &quot;Sailor
Bulk smash!&quot;

Gracefully Sailor Neptune dodged the wild blow even
as the green haired woman yelled, &quot;Neptune Deep
Submerge!&quot; The blue-green bolt of energy blasted the
transformed boy backwards, knocking him senseless for
now.

&quot;Star Serious Laser!&quot; Sailor Star Fighter yelled as
she and the Starlights broke through the flank of the
seething force of maddened Phages, sending several
crumpling to the ground.

Sailor Mercury smiled grimly as she said, &quot;Glad to
see you&#39;re all right.&quot;

Fighter said seriously, &quot;This is getting crazy...
I&#39;ve never encountered this many phages at one time.&quot;

Looking on at the chaos Sailor Iron Mouse looked
frustrated again as she used her powers to transform
yet another student into a phage. The gray haired girl
brightened a moment as the crystal shone, then scowled
as it&#39;s light went out, &quot;No Star Seed again?!&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve done dozens of transformations,&quot; her
assistant purred, &quot;I&#39;m sure the mistress will
appreciate your efforts.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Iron Mouse shook her head grimly as she
continued, &quot;I must find a true Star Seed, or I&#39;m
toast.&quot;

Star Maker blasted another phage back, her long brown
hair flowing in the wind. &quot;We need to get at the
source,&quot; she said as she kicked another phage aside,
&quot;or we&#39;ll be overwhelmed by pure numbers!&quot;

&quot;Agreed,&quot; Sailor Uranus agreed, &quot;but where are they
coming from?&quot;

&quot;Buy me a minute,&quot; Star Healer said as the white
haired girl reluctantly left the battle and bounded up
to the nearest roof. Scanning the battlefield she saw
a flare of bright light from the front gate, where a
few human students still tried to flee. Bounding down
to her fellow senshi&#39;s side she reported, &quot;I think
they&#39;re by the front gate.&quot;

Sailor Mercury drew her sword, willing it to shift to
it&#39;s scepter form as she gestured at the stunned
phages nearby and yelled, &quot;Mercury Freezing
Restoration!&quot; A wave of ice swept over the enemy
nearby then shattered, revealing normal students once
more.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Sailor Pluto whispered, looking
down at her younger lover with obvious concern.

&quot;I&#39;ll manage,&quot; Sailor Mercury replied with a smile,
pushing back the cloak that came with her secondary
transformation. She looked at her friends, &quot;Maker&#39;s
right, we&#39;ve got to stop the creation of more phages.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;ve got a plan?&quot; Star Fighter asked with a grin.

&quot;I think so,&quot; Mercury smiled back confidently. She
looked at Uranus, &quot;I seem to recall you being a track
star... are you still that fast?&quot;

Sailor Uranus smiled back, &quot;Just try me.&quot;

&quot;We saw that strange girl Iron Mouse creating phages
in our earlier battles,&quot; Mercury said, &quot;we&#39;ll assume
that she still is now. The rest of us will unite our
attacks to create a path, Uranus will then take the
fight to her.&quot;

&quot;Risky,&quot; Maker nodded, &quot;but it just might work.&quot;

&quot;Then let&#39;s do it,&quot; Pluto said, readying her staff to
attack.

&quot;Star Gentle Healing!&quot; Maker yelled, &quot;Star Sensitive
Inferno!&quot; Healer added, &quot;Star Serious Laser!&quot; Fighter
finished even as Pluto, Neptune and Mercury threw
their own attacks, the combined energies creating a
swath of destruction.

Like the sprinted she was Uranus raced off, tearing
through the path and bearing down on the shaken
looking Iron Mouse. &#39;Poor kid,&#39; she thought wryly.

&quot;Wha....&quot; the slightly stunned Iron Mouse managed.

&quot;Uranus World Shaking!&quot; she yelled as Uranus drew
power from the skies, focused it in her hand then cast
it at nearly point blank range!

BOOM!

&quot;Let&#39;s go,&quot; and with that Mercury lead the others in
a renewed assault, taking advantage of the disruption
to force their enemy&#39;s back and restore as many as
they could to humanity.

&quot;Owww,&quot; Iron mouse groaned, noting her cowardly
assistant had already disappeared. She was about to
get up when she felt something sharp prick her neck.

Uranus held her Space Sword at the girl&#39;s throat, her
expression serious as she said, &quot;Call off the phages,
now.&quot;

Iron Mouse gulped softly. &quot;I don&#39;t control them,&quot; she
said, eyeing the sword warily, &quot;I just create them.&quot;

&quot;Well, you&#39;re done making them now,&quot; Uranus said
grimly.

With the creation of phages stopped the senshi were
able to quickly bring the rampaging beings under
control, even as Mercury used her gifts to heal the
transformed people. Tiredly they gathered around Iron
Mouse, who looked even more worried, if possible.

&quot;You have to let me get a Star Seed or...&quot; Iron Mouse
begged.

&quot;Why do you want them?&quot; Sailor Mercury wondered, &quot;Why
are you doing this?&quot;

&#39;They really don&#39;t know,&#39; Fighter realized, silently
debating if she should speak. &#39;No, let&#39;s see what the
mouse says.&#39;

Iron Mouse hesitated, &quot;I....&quot;

&quot;Be silent!&quot; the voice boomed, shocking them all.
Looking up they saw the sky crackle with energy, a
face forming from the energy as it stared down in
contempt, &quot;You have failed me, Mouse.&quot;

&quot;Please Galaxia,&quot; Iron Mouse wailed....

&quot;Die,&quot; Galaxia said, as a bolt of pure power shot
from the storm of energy.

&quot;No!&quot; Sailor Mercury shoved Iron Mouse aside, both
dodging the bolt as the earth exploded around them.

&quot;You saved me...?&quot; Iron Mouse looked at her in
disbelief.

&quot;We save lives,&quot; Mercury answered as she held her
sword at the ready, &quot;it&#39;s what we do.&quot;

The figure in the clouds looked furious, &quot;You dare
defy me?&quot;

Sailor Mercury stood, her cape flowing around her as
she looked up with no fear in her expression. &quot;Yes,&quot;
she said, &quot;as long as you try to hurt the innocent, we
will stop you.&quot;

Iron Mouse was shaken to her core as she looked up at
Sailor Mercury, reminded of things she had forgotten
so long ago. Almost as if those memories belong to
someone else she recalled protecting her world, saving
lives like this woman did....

&quot;As will I,&quot; a voice boldly declared as two more
Sailor Senshi joined the fight. Sailor Saturn looked
grim as she hefted her weapon, while Chibi-Moon stood
ready to help with her pink moon wand.

There was a moment of silence as Galaxia assessed the
odds, then she said, &quot;Iron Mouse, you have one chance.
Come to me now.&quot;

&quot;I....&quot; Iron Mouse hesitated, then black lightning
flared around the metal wrist bands she wore on each
arm.

&quot;You&#39;re hurting her,&quot; Sailor Mercury cried as Iron
Mouse howled in pain.

&quot;Such is the price of disobedience,&quot; Galaxia answered
coldly.

Mercury clutched her sword, then turned on Iron Mouse
as it shifted to staff mode again. Pointing it at the
smaller girl she cried out, &quot;Mercury Freezing
Restoration!&quot;

In a second Iron Mouse was encased in ice, then as it
shattered the mysterious wrist bands broke away too.
Gazing in shock at her wrists Iron Mouse stammered,
&quot;I&#39;m... free?&quot;

Galaxia looked furious as she looked down at Mercury,
&quot;You will pay for this.&quot; She began to fade away, &quot;You
will all pay....&quot;

In seconds she was gone, and a eerie calm fell over
the broken schoolyard. Sailor Saturn hurried over as
she looked everyone over and asked, &quot;Are you all
right?&quot;

&quot;A little stunned,&quot; Healer admitted, the white haired
young woman watching Mercury assist the still shaken
Iron Mouse to stand.

&quot;I don&#39;t know how I can thank you,&quot; Iron Mouse
murmured, her expression much more gentle than before.

&quot;We have a great deal of questions,&quot; Sailor Pluto
said.

&quot;And I&#39;ll do my best to answer them,&quot; Iron Mouse
answered firmly.

0o0o0o0o0o0o0o0

Iron Mouse&#39;s assistant watched from a distance,
shaking her head so that her red-brown hair shimmered
in the light. &quot;Well, well,&quot; she murmured, &quot;who would
have believed it was possible for someone to break our
mistress&#39; hold?&quot;

&quot;Lead Crow,&quot; the blue haired girl said respectfully
as she waited by the car, &quot;we need to get back to the
station and plan our next move.&quot;

&quot;All right, Aluminum Seiren,&quot; Lead Crow agreed as
they headed to the car, &quot;and we&#39;d best ready our
defenses as well.&quot;

Aluminum Seiren nodded, &quot;Iron Mouse will lead them
right to us.&quot;

&quot;And right into a trap,&quot; Lead Crow agreed, chuckling
wickedly.
