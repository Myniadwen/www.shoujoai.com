---Tokyo, the Present---

&quot;Minerva! No!&quot; Sailor Pluto screamed.

The other Senshi looked on, stunned at what had just occurred. Sailor 
Moon, recovering first, stepped forward, &quot;What did you do to Minerva? 
Where is she?&quot;

Saeko smiled, &quot;I liberated her.&quot; she declared triumphantly, &quot;I have sent 
her to a far better place, a place of truth. A place of silence. She is 
free now.&quot;

Sailor Pluto&#39;s eyes narrowed as she moved toward the woman, &quot;Bring her 
back.&quot; she snarled, &quot;Or I&#39;ll kill you here and now.&quot;

The scientist laughed, &quot;I see... And if I&#39;m dead, how would you get her 
back then?&quot; she asked. &quot;However, if you want to see her again so 
badly...&quot; she said as she aimed the metal sphere at the Time Senshi, &quot;Go 
see her now!&quot;

&quot;Silence Wall!&quot; Sailor Saturn yelled. The beam stopped about five feet 
from the Senshi standing there. Sailors Mars and Jupiter went to rush 
her, when she pulled a second device out of her clothing. The bright 
white flash lasted less than a second but was bright enough to blind 
everyone long enough for Saeko to make her escape. As everyone&#39;s 
eyesight slowly came back, Mercury put her visor down to look around. 
Unfortunately, there was no trace of Minerva or the woman who attacked 
her and the others. Sailor Uranus leapt to the rooftop of a nearby pet 
store in hopes of spotting the scientist from the air.

Neptune came over to Pluto&#39;s side and put her hand on her shoulder, 
&quot;We&#39;ll save Kiho-chan, Sets. Don&#39;t worry about that. But what she said 
about being a scientist from the future, did you...&quot;

Pluto nodded her head, &quot;There was a temporal disturbance when she 
materialized. She did travel through time, but...&quot; her voice trailed off 
and she seemed to stare off into the distance. Neptune looked at her 
with concern as Sailor Moon came over.

&quot;Pluto-chan,&quot; the blond said consolingly, &quot;Don&#39;t look so sad. We&#39;ll get 
Kihomi and...&quot;

&quot;The timegate.&quot; Pluto said, still looking off, &quot;A second person has just 
come back from the future, this time through the timegate.&quot;

Sailor Venus came over, picking leaves out of her hair as she did so, 
&quot;Pluto, are you sure?&quot;

The Time Senshi slowly nodded her head, &quot;Yes, I... I&#39;m sure. My future 
self must&#39;ve sent someone back.&quot; she said grimly. Sailor Moon gave her a 
look.

&quot;Chibi Usa?&quot; the blond asked, &quot;Was she sent back to help?&quot;

Pluto shook her head, &quot;No, not Chibi Usa; the energy pattern doesn&#39;t fit 
hers. Someone else has come back. I...&quot; her voice trailed off again and 
the future queen could see tears beginning to form at the corners of 
Setsuna&#39;s eyes.

&quot;If they sent someone other than Chibi Usa, there must be some sort of a 
threat posed by that scientist to the future Crystal Tokyo, a threat too 
big for her to handle.&quot; Sailor Mercury reasoned out loud. Pluto looked 
over to where Minerva had been standing just a few moments before.

&quot;The future Crystal Tokyo,&quot; she said with a sinking feeling, &quot;Or perhaps 
one of its inhabitants.&quot;

Uranus came back to where her fellow Senshi were gathered, &quot;Nothing.&quot; 
she admitted, &quot;I think she may have escaped into the subway system, but 
I couldn&#39;t find her.&quot;

&quot;What do we do?&quot; Sailor Mars asked, &quot;We can&#39;t just give up? She&#39;s out 
there somewhere, and...&quot;

&quot;And for now we don&#39;t know where.&quot; Sailor Uranus interrupted. &quot;Look, 
let&#39;s meet at the shrine in half an hour and figure out our next move.&quot;

The others reluctantly agreed. Before she left, Pluto took one last look 
at where Minerva had disappeared.

&quot;Kiho-chan.&quot; she whispered as she wiped away a tear, &quot;Where are you?&quot;

---Crystal Tokyo, 3043---

Princess Daimos ran into the royal chamber where her parents, Mars and 
Venus, were gathered around Lady Pluto and her wife. Daimos, a product 
of the science of parthenogenesis in which two egg cells are combined to 
produce a child, went to her mother Venus&#39; side as the Princess of Love 
sadly kept vigil with the others.

Daimos was soon joined by Princesses Ganymede and Europa, the children 
of Ladies Jupiter and Mercury. Lady Minerva, her head cradled in her 
love&#39;s lap, opened her eyes a crack and saw the three young Princesses.

&quot;P... Pluto-chan?&quot;

&quot;Yes, beloved.&quot; her wife whispered as she wiped the tears from her eyes.

&quot;I... I&#39;m sorry we never had children.&quot; she said as she faded into 
transparency again. Lady Venus was beside herself with grief at watching 
both her friends suffer in this way. As Lady Minerva became solid once 
again, Pluto stroked her cheek.

&quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; the Princess of Time answered, &quot;We never had children of our 
own, but we had each other. Besides, I talked with the Queen and... 
and... she said that next time, she&#39;d try to use her powers to help us.&quot;

Minerva smiled, &quot;Next time.&quot; she said, feeling weaker by the second, 
&quot;You... You&#39;d make such a wonderful mother.&quot;

Lady Pluto, unable to hold back the pain anymore, pulled her wife into a 
hug as she began to sob. The others all came closer to offer their 
support. At that moment King Endymion entered, followed by Ladies Uranus 
and Neptune. The King&#39;s face was red with anger and indignation.

&quot;The guards!&quot; he shouted angrily, &quot;She seduced one of the guards into 
smuggling four flash bombs and a miniature disrupter into the royal 
court!&quot; He was about to yell some more when he noticed the sad and 
pained expressions of the royals. Bringing himself under control, he 
came over.

&quot;She... She&#39;s still fading.&quot; Pluto murmured, &quot;We sent her back in time 
to save her, why is she still fading?&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Ganymede, the youngest member of the royal court asked, &quot;Who was 
sent back?&quot;

&quot;Your mother.&quot; Endymion answered the child. Turning back to Lady Pluto, 
he put his hand on her shoulder, &quot;Minerva won&#39;t cease to exist, Pluto. 
Don&#39;t ask me how, but I just know it. Have faith; she&#39;ll save her.&quot;

Lady Pluto swallowed hard as she continued to hold her beloved, wishing 
with all her might this wasn&#39;t happening. If events in the past weren&#39;t 
reversed fast, Sailor Minerva would cease to exist, and soon afterwards 
all memory of the time they&#39;d spent together would be erased as well.

---An Alternate Reality, the Present---

Sailor Minerva looked at the materials in front of her as she began to 
shiver a bit from the cold. She&#39;d gathered some wood from the demolished 
buildings and dead trees in her vicinity and had arranged them in a 
pile. In one of the ruins that had apparently once been used as a 
department store she found a book of matches. Hoping the things would 
still work, she struck five of them before she got a flame. She soon had 
a bonfire going.

She allowed the transformation to fade, becoming Saeko Kihomi once 
again. The fuku was too cold for the environment she now found herself 
in, and as she thanked the fates for the fact she was wearing a 
turtleneck sweater and blue jeans before she transformed, she did wish 
she&#39;d had time to eat before being sent here. As she pulled a tattered 
blanket she&#39;d found around herself, her stomach started to growl.

Looking around her, she found a femur of a skeleton and picked it up. 
Using some cloth she&#39;d found, she wrapped it around the end of the upper 
leg bone, and lit it. Keeping the blanket around herself, she went off 
in search of something edible.

All sorts of nightmarish thoughts began to creep into her head. She&#39;d 
read a book when she was younger about an alien world where it was 
always day because of multiple stars lighting up the sky, until one day 
all the suns set at the same time and everyone went insane. She&#39;d also 
heard of a play called &quot;No Exit&quot; about a group of people finding 
themselves condemned to Hell in the same room for all eternity. If she 
remembered correctly, one or more of the characters was gay.

Was that where she was now? Hell?

She knew that most religions condemned lesbianism, but it wasn&#39;t like it 
was ever a choice for her. She had always known that she was gay, and 
had never had any desire for men. She didn&#39;t hate them; she simply 
didn&#39;t feel any yearnings for them the way she did for her own sex. If 
she were dead, would she be sent to Hell for that? She&#39;d never chosen to 
feel this way; it was simply the way she was.

Looking around her, she quickly dispelled the theory she was in Hell. 
There were no demons, no devil, and no flames. There were human remains 
as far as the eye could see, and the ruins of a great city, but it was 
too chilly to be Hell. Besides, why would Hell have a giant statue of 
Hotaru?

She found what must have once been a grocery store. Entering, she 
cautiously made her way in and found several cans of soup and some cans 
of sardines. The darkness all around her was oppressive, causing her to 
constantly look over her shoulder and nervously look at the bizarre 
shapes the ruins made in the dark.

Finding her way back to the bonfire, she saw something that caught her 
eye. There was a bit of color among some skeletal remains over to her 
left about twenty feet away. Making sure to remain within eyesight of 
her fire, she went over to investigate. As she got closer, she could 
feel a scream well up within her for the second time that day.

There, among the other headless dead, was a skeleton of someone a fair 
bit shorter than her. The deceased was wearing Sailor Mercury&#39;s fuku.

---Tokyo, the Present---

The women all gathered at the Hikawa Jinga Shrine on Sendai Hill. They 
now knew they had at least two people from the future running around 
loose in the present, and that the danger thus posed to the future 
kingdom was enormous.

Ami spoke up, &quot;I&#39;ve been going through maps of the Tokyo subway system 
on my computer. If she did escape into the subway system, she may not 
have had any money on her. Unfortunately there are still enough hidden 
paths and lower levels where the homeless population lives that finding 
her will pose a bit of a problem.&quot;

&quot;And that&#39;s if she went down there.&quot; Rei pointed out, &quot;And if she 
doesn&#39;t have any money, and if she&#39;s still down there and hasn&#39;t left 
yet to blend herself into the crowded Tokyo streets.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s like looking for a needle in a stitch in time.&quot; Minako grumbled.

&quot;Usagi-chan! Usagi-chan!&quot; a feminine voice called out. The blond in 
question turned around to see Luna running up to her and the other 
Senshi, &quot;We have big trouble!&quot;

&quot;How did you know already?&quot; Makoto asked from where she was standing. 
The cat blinked at her confused.

&quot;Know what already?&quot; the cat asked, only then noticing the perturbed and 
agitated faces of everyone. Usagi came over and knelt down to talk to 
her more at eye level.

&quot;Kihomi.&quot; The blond said, &quot;She&#39;s gone.&quot;

&quot;Gone?&quot; the cat asked, &quot;Where did she go?&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t know where, we... Wait a second,&quot; Usagi said, &quot;If you didn&#39;t 
know about that, what were you referring to when you said we had big 
trouble?&quot;

&quot;Well, remember when Chibi Usa made your parents and brother think she 
was your cousin?&quot;

Setsuna and the others were now listening in. Makoto and Minako slowly 
walked up from behind Sailor Moon to hear better.

&quot;Yes.&quot; Usagi said, &quot;Of course I remember.&quot;

Luna came closer, &quot;And later, remember Chibi Chibi hypnotizing your 
family into thinking she was your sibling?&quot;

The blond nodded again, &quot;Luna, what are you trying to say?&quot;

The cat stepped still closer, staring intently into Sailor Moon&#39;s baby 
blue eyes, &quot;Usagi, your &#39;older sister&#39; Emi is over at your parent&#39;s 
house.&quot;

---To Be Continued---

End Notes: Daimos is a moon of Mars, and Ganymede and Europa are moons 
of Jupiter (don&#39;t worry, they only play cameos).

Also, the science of parthenogenesis is not as wild as it sounds. Among 
bees, for example, unfertilized eggs develop into male drones while 
fertilized eggs produce female workers and queens. Also, the first 
recorded instance of artificial parthenogenesis occurred in 1900 (it was 
done to frog eggs by a scientist named Jacques Loeb). Obviously we&#39;re 
nowhere near being able to combine two human eggs to produce a child, 
but hey; I&#39;m pretty sure by 3043 we&#39;ll be there.</pre>
