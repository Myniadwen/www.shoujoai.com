<h1>Con Su Adios, Usted Toma Con Usted Mi Co (part 11 of 14)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/adios-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>The following afternoon, the two girls were still snuggled deep inside 
Makoto&#39;s warm bed, the comforter wrapped around them tightly. Out side 
the snow was falling, adding to the Christmas feel.

Christmas.

Makoto had nearly forgotten. But not quite. 

She nuzzled Minako&#39;s head before planting a small kiss there. Her back 
still ached from the attacks from the previous night. But, last 
night&#39;s later events seemed to have been well worth the scars.

Makoto smiled as she brushed Minako&#39;s hair away from her sleeping 
face. She smiled as her finger traced a small scar at Minako&#39;s hair 
line.

*I was right,* Makoto thought. *It did leave a scar.*

Makoto closed her eyes, feeling Minako&#39;s warm breath on her neck. As 
content as she was, she couldn&#39;t sleep. She reopened her eyes and 
gently kissed Minako&#39;s head. Slowly pulling away from Minako&#39;s warm 
embrace, Makoto silently went thru her drawers to find a pair of sweat 
pants and a tee shirt. After putting on the clothing she went out into 
the hall and walked down to her studio. Makoto picked up a note book 
of drawing paper, a pencil, an eraser, a sharpener and several types 
of coal pencils.

She walked back into her room and smiled. Minako was clutching her 
pillow, still sleeping. Makoto laid her things on her night stand and 
pulled the chair she had in her cornor near the bed. She postioned it 
just right and then sat down with her pencil and pad of paper...

------------------------------------------------------------

Minako groaned when the sense of warmth next to her began to fade. 
Yawning she opened her eyes to see Makoto looking at her over a pad of 
paper.

&quot;Don&#39;t move,&quot; Makoto whispered. &quot;I&#39;m almost done.&quot;

Minako nodded slightly and smiled. She knew Makoto had a great talent 
for real life drawing, but not once had Makoto ever drawn her. Minako 
blushed slightly. She never knew that Makoto would one day draw her 
like she was now: cuddeling a pillow, and half naked from the waist 
up.

Makoto blew on the picture to rid herself of loose coal marks before 
signing the picture. Minako gathered the blanket around her body and 
tip toed over to see herself. Minako gasped when she saw it. It looked 
as if it were a black and white photo. All the shadow markings were in 
the right places, and it looked so real. Makoto smiled at Minako&#39;s 
reaction.

&quot;You like?&quot;

Minako smiled as she sat on the arm of the chair. She took the paper 
from Makoto and nodded. &quot;Hai, I do. It looks so real.&quot;

Makoto blushed slightly. &quot;I&#39;m rusty. I haven&#39;t drawn from life in a 
few years. I&#39;m surprised it came out so well.&quot;

Minako smiled and kissed Makoto on her temple. &quot;Is it mine?&quot;

Makoto shrugged and smiled slyly. &quot;What will you give me for it?&quot;

Minako leaned across Makoto to place the note pad back on the night 
stand. Sliding off the arm of the chair and into Makoto&#39;s lap, Minako 
answered, &quot;Hm. Depends on what you want.&quot; She wrapped her arms loosely 
around Makoto&#39;s neck and nibbled in her skin.

Makoto moaned slightly and leaned her head back. &quot;Well...that feels 
nice.&quot; Minako giggled and continued to kiss and bite Makoto&#39;s neck, 
her hands slowly going up Makoto&#39;s shirt...

I never thought you were a fairweather friend
You never let me down, you&#39;re true to the end
You&#39;re in the darkest hour, when all was lost
Somehow you left the light on
You faced the wrong and showed the world a thing or two
Stood up for me, for you
And you should know...

Makoto stood in her bathroom, combing her hair. She had to repeatedly 
wipe the mirror free of steam seeing how Minako was in the shower. 
After placing her hair up in her trade mark ponytail, Makoto walked 
back into her bedroom. 

She opened her closet door and began to decide what shirt to wear. She 
could hear Minako turn the water off and smiled. Moments later, she 
heard Minako walk into the bed room.

&quot;Come here, Mako-chan,&quot; Minako said setting down more gauze and 
medical tape. &quot;I want to look at your back.&quot;

Makoto nodded as she pulled out a white, button up dress shirt. She 
turned to face Minako and her jaw hit the floor. Minako had yet to get 
dressed and was standing in a towel wrapped around her small body and 
another towel was holding her hair ontop of her head. Minako giggled.

&quot;Yea, I know you like what you see. Now turn around.&quot; Makoto nodded 
and did as she was told. She felt Minako unsnap her bra and the tape 
being peeled away from her skin. She felt Minako run her hand gent;y 
over her back after Minako pulled the gauze away from her skin.

It didn&#39;t hurt.

&quot;Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto turned her head to look at Minako over her shoulder. &quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;Do you heal quickly?&quot; Minako didn&#39;t know what else to say. She had 
only known several people to heal quickly from such wounds. And they 
were all Senshi.

Makoto inwardly groaned. *It must be my new senshi powers doing that. 
Crap!*

&quot;Hai, I do,&quot; Makoto said.

Minako continued to run her hand over Makoto&#39;s back. &quot;I was just 
wondering because the scratches are gone.&quot;

Makoto was nearly floored. *Think of a lie!!*

&quot;I&#39;ve always healed quickly Mina-chan. You probably don&#39;t remember.&quot;

Minako sighed and kissed Makoto&#39;s back. &quot;Iie, I guess not.&quot; She 
snapped Makoto&#39;s bra back into place and gent;y patted her shoulder. 
&quot;Ok, you can get dressed now.&quot;

Makoto turned to kiss Minako&#39;s cheek then placed her shirt over her 
shoulders. &quot;Thank you.&quot;

Minako looked at Makoto as she slid her panties on under the towel. 
&quot;For what?&quot;

&quot;For taking care of me last night.&quot;

Minako blushed and nodded. &quot;A-any time.&quot;

Makoto smiled and buttoned her shirt. &quot;So, what are we doing today, 
Mina-chan?&quot;

Minako shrugged as she snapped her bra. &quot;I dunno. What do you want to 
do?&quot;

Makoto smiled shyly. &quot;Well, what I&#39;d like to do all would require us 
to strip and spen the rest of the day in that bed over there.&quot;

Minkao laughed and blushed slightly. &quot;Mako!&quot;

&quot;I was just teasing,&quot; Makoto said, tuckining her shirt into her jeans.

&quot;Thats good,&quot; Minako said, walking to Makoto&#39;s closet to choose an 
outfit for herself.

&quot;There always the couch, shower, and kitchen table!&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t help but to giggle. &quot;You...no wonder you stayed single 
so long.&quot;

Makoto just made a face an impersonated Minako. &quot;No wonder you stayed 
single so long. Neh nah nah. Shut up.&quot; Makoto meant for it to sound 
stren, but her voice cracked with laughter.

Minako giggled more and pulled out a pair of jeans she knew had to 
have been to small for her girlfriend and a very large green sweater. 
She quickly dressed and combed her hair.

While Minako was brushing her hair, Ace sneaked into Makoto&#39;s room.

&quot;Why did you do that last night,&quot; he hissed at her.

&quot;Oh shut up. You know damn well why.&quot; Makoto glared at her guardian.

And he glared back. &quot;But why? You know destiney will not permit you 
two to be together. Things have changed Makoto. And they will change 
again.&quot; He sighed and shook his head. Looking back up at Makoto, he 
said, &quot;I worry about you. I just don&#39;t want you getting hurt again.&quot;

Makoto nodded. Ace had always been the closest thing to a father she 
had ever had after her parents died. &quot;Hai, I know. But, you know how I 
feel about her. I know I may get hurt again. But, I&#39;d rather risk of 
getting burned again for a second chance then to let it slip by.&quot;

&quot;You know you two will be torn apart again. And soon.&quot;

Makoto nodded, getting her leather belt and looping it thru her jeans. 
&quot;Hai. And I&#39;ll do it a third time and a fourth time.&quot;

Ace smiled slightly. &quot;You are so stubborn.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;I get it from you.&quot;

Some say it wasn&#39;t worth the things we went through
I say it ain&#39;t worth losing you
I hope you know how much you have changed all our lives
Someday you&#39;ll see if only through heaven&#39;s eyes

&quot;Ooo...Go Mako-chan! Go!&quot; Minako cheered as Makoto crossed the finish 
line first.

Makoto laughed slightly. &quot;That game is hard. Why don&#39;t you try raceing 
these guys?&quot;

&quot;Cause I&#39;d lose. No thank you.&quot; Makoto smiled.

&quot;Konnichi wa, you two,&quot; said a voice behind them. Makoto and Minako 
turned their heads to see Usagi, Rei, and Ami. 

&quot;Hey,&quot; Makoto said. &quot;Whats up you guys?&quot;

Usagi went to stand on the other side of Makoto. &quot;Nothing much. Just 
stopping for a late lunch. We&#39;ve been shopping all day.&quot; Usagi looked 
up at Minako. &quot;I called your house, but you didn&#39;t answer the phone.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Thats &#39;cause I stole her before you called.&quot;

Rei smiled and stood behind Makoto, leaning on the back of the racing 
chair. &quot;Bad Mako-chan. How are you doing on the game?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m doing good. Its the fifth time I won it today.&quot; Makoto glared up 
at Minako. &quot;I would have long ago quit if *someone* didn&#39;t want that 
giant teddy bear this arcade is holding for ten Nascar race wins.&quot; 
Minako giggled.

&quot;Thats your fault for areeing to do it for me.&quot;

&quot;No kidding.&quot; Makoto turned her head up and smiled at Rei. &quot;Have you 
guys eaten yet?&quot;

Rei shook her head. &quot;Iie. We just got here when we saw you two and we 
thought we&#39;d say hi. Would you like to join us?&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Hai. I&#39;m starving. I got a bit of a work out last 
night.&quot; Makoto laughed when Minako blushed and walked away from the 
group to find a table.

I still remember the things that you said
I keep you words alive I could never forget
Cause in the final hour you made me proud
So proud that I could know you
You told the world its time that they believed in you
And you should know...

&quot;So, the Senshi are fighting amongst themselves are they? They want to 
kick Sailor Moon out of the group and choose a new leader?&quot; Kunzite 
laughed to himself.

&quot;Thats how it seems to me,&quot; said a deep femine voice. &quot;What do you 
want me to do?&quot;

Kunzite thought for a moment. &quot;Keep an eye on them Ninjana. I want to 
make sure thats what is going on before we make a move.&quot;

&quot;Of course, Kunzite-sama.&quot; Ninjana then disappeared. 

Some say it wasn&#39;t worth the things we went through
I say it ain&#39;t worth losing you
I hope you know how much you&#39;ve changed all our lives
Someday you&#39;ll see if only though heaven&#39;s eyes

Afew days later, Ninjana returned to the Negaverse kingdom. With her 
she had a pink letter from Sailor Moon.

She presented the letter to Kunzite, who read the letter to himself. 
&quot;So, our little rabbit wants to solo. She&#39;s willing to trade the 
crystal for the spoiled prince.&quot;

&quot;Does it say how she wants to trade?&quot;

&quot;Hai. She wants to meet you alone, infront of the giant clock in the 
park.&quot; Kunzite looked up Ninjana. &quot;I, of course, will be there.&quot;

Ninjana nodded and left.

&quot;The crystal will soon be mine.&quot; Kunzite&#39;s hand was quickly engulfed 
by flames, Usagi&#39;s letter buring to ashes.

------------------------------------------------------------

Sailor moon stood next to the clock at midnight, waiting for the 
reporter to show. She was nervous, but tried her best to not let it 
show. A few feet away, the other senshi watched.

&quot;Do you think this will work,&quot; Venus asked.

Mars shook her head. &quot;I don&#39;t know. Mercury, get your scanner ready.&quot;

Mercury nodded and did as she was told.

Above the senshi, standing in the shadows behind Sailor moon stood two 
shadows. One was Sailor Jupiter and the other was her tiger.

&quot;Do you think they&#39;ll show, Yung hu,&quot; Jupiter asked.

The tiger shook his head. &quot;I don&#39;t know. All we can do is wait and 
see. I&#39;m sure they will. That crystal of their&#39;s is at stake.&quot;

Jupiter nodded. &quot;Yung hu?&quot;

&quot;Hai?&quot;

&quot;What were you gonna tell me the other night before Minako showed up?&quot;

The tiger looked up at Jupiter. &quot;When?&quot;

&quot;When I asked you why I was so tired.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that.&quot; Yung hu looked back towards Sailor Moon. &quot;I believe ite 
because your body isn&#39;t use to have so many forms in one body.&quot;

&quot;Nani? What do you mean by that?&quot;

&quot;The other senshi tire as well. But you see, they only have two forms; 
their senshi forms and their everyday form. You, on the other hand, 
have three. You tire more quickly than the others do. And because of 
that, it takes you longer to recoperate.&quot;

Jupite nodded. &quot;Can I die from that alone?&quot;

Yung hu thought for a moment. &quot;Hm. Perhaps. But, I think if you stop 
using forms at the same time, you&#39;d be alright. Your senshi form is 
your true warrior form. You know that.&quot;

&quot;Hai, but my other form is stronger.&quot;

Yung hu chuckled. &quot;Always looking out to be stronger. Your senshi form 
will gain experiance and get stronger with battles. It takes time.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m impatient.&quot;

&quot;I know.&quot;

The two warriors fell silent for a few moments.

&quot;Why aren&#39;t you ever tired, Yung Hu? You have three forms as well.&quot;

&quot;Actually, I have four. But, I&#39;m an inmortal. I won&#39;t die from it 
although I do tire just as easily as you do.&quot;

Jupiter nodded once again. Her eyes narrowed as her vision focused on 
shadows that were moving between Sailor Moon and the other senshi.

&quot;Yung hu, is that-?&quot;

&quot;Hai. They&#39;re here.&quot;

And so we can&#39;t forget
We&#39;ve got to keep remembering them all
The ones who took the fall
They did it for usall
And we should learn from it
Stand up if you believe in it
You&#39;ve got to face the world...be strong

------------------------------------------------------------

Sailor moon cried out when the whip wrapped itself around her throat. 
Ninjana pulled on the whip to bring her to her knees. Kunzite sneered 
at the blonde.

&quot;Where is it?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not giving it to you. Not now! Not ever!!&quot;

&quot;Oh you will. The question is tho, will you be alive when it happens?&quot;

Jupiter was still in the shadows. &quot;When can we attack?&quot;

&quot;When the others show themselves. I don&#39;t want them to get the 
crystal.&quot;

Jupiter shook her head. &quot;They won&#39;t. Sailor Moon doesn&#39;t even have 
it.&quot;

The tiger looked up at his ward. &quot;How do you know that?&quot;

Jupiter sighed and pulled out the cresent moon wand from behind her 
back. &quot;Its because I have it.&quot;

&quot;How do you have that,&quot; Yung hu asked, disbelief on his face.

&quot;I didn&#39;t steal it,&quot;Jupiter hissed. &quot;I found it one night at Rei&#39;s 
after Usagi left. Minako told me they were going to do this so I took 
it.&quot;

Yung hu smiled. &quot;Lets go!&quot; He then roared. Everyone turned to where he 
and Jupiter were and watched. He soon jumped from the shadows and 
slashed at the whip, cutting it in half. Sailor moon fell backwards, 
catching her breath. Yung hu stepped in front of Sailor Moon and 
snarled at the two warriors from the dark side.

Sailor Jupiter ran out from the shadows and threw an attack towards 
Ninjana, making her jump back away from them. Jupiter then knealt down 
at Sailor Moon&#39;s side and helped her sit up. 

&quot;I believe this is yours, your highness,&quot; Jupiter said, handing her 
the wand.

Sailor moon looked at her in disbelied. &quot;How&#39;d you-&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll explain later.&quot; She then stood and took a fighting stance. 
Glaring at Ninjana, she smiled. &quot;Lets go bitch!&quot;

Ninjana glared angerily at Jupiter and readied her stars. Just as she 
was about throw them, she heard someone yell from behind her.

&quot;Mars fire ignite!&quot;

Ninjana screamed out in pain as the fire attack hit her. She fell to 
her knees and her breath came in short gasps. Jupiter looked back 
towards Sailor Moon, who only nodded.

She held the wand over her head and cried out her attack and healed 
the reporter. Sailor Jupiter smiled at Sailor Moon, the others running 
up to join them.

They soon heard a crackeling noise above them. 

&quot;MOVE,&quot; Jupiter screamed, jumping from her place, the others following 
suit before a giant fire ball struck the exact place they were just 
standing.

Jupiter glared up at Kunzite. She heard someone whimper next to her 
and saw Venus holding her leg, which had black, charred places on it. 
Her eyes began to glow bright green, and Yung Hu groaned.

*Makoto, please don&#39;t change. Hold your temper.*

His pleas went unanswered as Jupiter&#39;s fuku split in the back, white 
feathered wings sprouting from her back. She hunched over as the 
transformation took hold of her body. A bright light engulfed her body 
and when it disappeared, Mitsuakai stood among the senshi. Behind her 
stood Yung Hu in his gargoyle form.

Mintusakai jumped from her spot and flew at Kunzite who disappeared 
and reappeared above the senshi. Mitsuakai landed on the clock and 
jumped from it, hitting him this time. They fell towards the ground 
and landed with a sickening thud. The others got up from the ground 
and ran to stand by the clock&#39;s base, watching the two battle.

Mitusakai punched Kunzite in the face and stomache, making the warrior 
fall to his knees. She raised her arms intending to deilver a final 
blow to the back of his head, but he stood quickly and blasted her 
towards the senshi, her back hitting the clock. Stummbeling slightly, 
he quickly disappeared before Yung hu could attack him.

Sailor Moon grabbed Mitsuakai&#39;s arm and helped her stand. 

&quot;Are you alright?&quot;

The senshi and Yung Hu heard Mitsuakai growl, and saw that her eyes 
had never stopped glowing. Yelling with a roar louder than Yung Hu&#39;s, 
Mitsuakai grabbed hold of Sailor Moon&#39;s throat and slammed her into 
the clock.

Some say it wasn&#39;t worth the things we went through
I say it ain&#39;t worth loosing you
I hope you know how much you&#39;ve changed all our lives
Someday you&#39;ll see if only through heaven&#39;s eyes
