<a href="../smoon/2lonely-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>Ohayo Minna!!! Well here&#39;s yet another story by yours truly. It&#39;s an
alternate world from the one I normally write in. As many of you may,
or may not, know I usually write Amy/Lita stories; this one however is
about Minako and Makoto.  Anyway I want to dedicate this story to a
few people. One, my very good friend and adopted little sister, Heather
McCoy, thank you so much for being my friend. To Kitty-Kat, remember
that there are always people who care about you, and to Chibi-Usa
Tomoe, love conquers all my friend, love truly conquers all. Standard
Disclaimer: I don&#39;t own Sailor Moon or any of the characters they&#39;re
in. The fabulous Naoko Takeuchi and various companies own these really
wonderful characters. Now on with the story!

--------------------------------

Makoto&#39;s Dream

It was raining heavily as Makoto looked around the vacant playground
where she had been dumped yet again. It always seemed to come back to
this place, and no matter how clich&eacute; it seemed it always seemed to be
raining when it happened. She began to cry, heartbroken that the person
she declared her love to had left her again. The rain pelted her and
soaked through her clothes as she saw All of her ex-boyfriends face
flash by her as the laughed. Again and again it happened, laughter
arose from the shadows around her causing her tears to flow more
freely. A cry, torn from her very soul echoed through the empty
playground, a cry of absolute loneliness and despair. She had cried out
like this many on many nights, using the scream to ease the pain in her
tortured soul. Her tears fell faster and harder, not stopping. She
cried hysterically, in the midst of her tears a pair of arms suddenly
wrapped themselves around her, and hushed the trembling of her broken
heart and soul.

Makoto felt the warmth from the person holding her and she began to cry
freely into the person&#39;s shoulder, crying for all the lost loves in her
life. Crying from the years of solitude she had endured, always having
to look strong when all she wanted was love. The other began to softly
caress Makoto&#39;s hair and held the taller girl tightly, making Makoto
suddenly aware that the person holding her was another girl. Looking
down into the bluer than blue eyes she found herself caught up in a
wave of emotions and slowly brought her lips to those of her angel.
Their lips met in a fiercely passionate kiss, one that spoke of
absolute love and devotion. As their kiss broke Makoto stepped back to
look at the angel that had come to save her from her loneliness only to
see the fading image of a familiar blonde with sky blue eyes

&quot;Minako?&quot; She said to herself as she awoke suddenly to find herself
still in the Fruit Parlor with Minako fast asleep on her shoulder.
Smiling to herself, Makoto decided to let the blonde girl sleep a while
longer as she really had no where else to go. &#39;Besides she thought,
this isn&#39;t so bad. At least someone needs me for something other than a
fight.&#39; Yawning Makoto noticed Minako stirring, slowly opening her eye.

&quot;Oh hi there Mako-chan.&quot; She said happily. &quot;I guess we went to sleep
huh? Guess we must&#39;ve needed it.&quot; Yawning again Minako stretched as she
got up and turned again to Makoto. &quot;I guess we won&#39;t be seeing that
movie tonight after all huh?&quot; Makoto blinked and looked at the time. It
was only five o&#39;clock. True there were no classes tomorrow because of
curriculum planning so maybe Minako so technically they could still see
a movie, maybe do some girls only stuff tomorrow.

&quot;Hey Minako its only five. Why don&#39;t we go to my place and watch some
videos? I&#39;ll cook and you can stay over if you want. We don&#39;t have
school tomorrow so it would be nice to have someone to hang out with.
Just the two of us. What do you think Minako-chan?&quot; Minako blinked at
her friend and hoped her cheeks weren&#39;t turning different shades of
red. It took her a moment to speak but she decided that it might be
nice to see Makoto for a day, even if it was only as a friend.

&quot;Sounds great Mako-chan! My parents are out of town so I don&#39;t have to
ask, so all I need to do is stop by and get some clothes.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve got something I can loan you for
the day. Lets go, I&#39;ve got the perfect movie for us to watch first.&quot;
Minako smiled at this and let herself be led out of the Fruit Parlor as
she and Makoto walked towards the taller girl&#39;s apartment. When they
got there Makoto went directly to her kitchen and began to cook. Fixing
a simple meal of rice and stir-fried vegetables. &#39;Not complicated but
with company it might be best to keep things simple. Besides I doubt
Minako really cares all that much. I wish I could carefree like that,
but with all the heartbreak I&#39;ve had I guess that won&#39;t be happening
anytime soon.&#39;

While Makoto was busy in the kitchen, Minako was looking at the videos
he friend had. What she saw surprised her; she saw several animated
films from America, most of which she had never heard of. &#39;Wow&#39;, she
thought. &#39;I never figured Makoto was such a fan of animation. Guess
there&#39;s a lot that I don&#39;t know about her.&#39; Sighing to herself she went
into the kitchen to see if she could help.

&quot;Hey Mako-chan,&quot; she said. &quot;Is there anything I can do to help?&quot;

&quot;Sure Minako-chan, could you set the table? I rarely use it since I eat
alone so much. It&#39;ll be nice to have someone to talk to for a change.&quot;
Minako felt her heart breaking at this. &#39;How could anyone not love
her?&#39; she thought to herself. &#39;Oh I wish she felt the same way I do.&#39;
Minako set the table and anxiously awaited the sweet smelling food that
was coming from the kitchen.

As the two girls at they talked about all the adventures they&#39;d had.
Minako enjoyed telling Makoto about all the exciting times she&#39;d had
when she was Sailor V. They laughed and shared many stories as they
ate. As they finished Makoto took the dishes to her kitchen as Minako
headed into the living room again.

&quot;Hey Mako-chan, what do you want to watch first?&quot; Minako called out.

&quot;Well why don&#39;t you pick the first movie and I&#39;ll pick the next one?&quot;
Minako nodded and went to look at the movies again. As she read over
the titles she came to an animated film she hadn&#39;t noticed the first
time she read over the movies. Picking it up she read the title, &#39;The
Last Unicorn. Looks cool to me&#39; she thought.

&quot;How about this one Mako-chan?&quot; she said, handing the movie to her
friend. She felt a slight tingle as Makoto&#39;s hand brushed her own as
the taller girl took the movie.

&quot;This is a great choice Minako-chan! I haven&#39;t seen this one in a long
time. You&#39;ll love it!&quot; Makoto said happily as she popped the movie into
her VCR and sat on her couch, her knees pulled up to her chest. Minako
giggled as she watched her friend. &#39;She&#39;s so cute when she&#39;s like this.
I just wish I could tell her how I feel about her.&#39; Turning to the
movie she watched with rapt fascination the story of a lonely Unicorn,
on a quest to find the rest of her kind. The friends laughed as
Schmendrick attempted spell after spell, crying at the movies ending.
The movie left Minako shocked, she had never expected Makoto to have
that kind of movie. As the credits began to roll Makoto smiled as she
stopped the tape and replaced it with another film.

&quot;I hope you don&#39;t mind Minako-chan, but I&#39;m kinda in the mood for
animation tonight. This is another of my favorite films, I even have
the book. I&#39;ve read it five times already. Its called The Hobbit, I
hope you like it.&quot;

&quot;If its anything like The Last Unicorn I&#39;m sure I will Mako-chan.&quot;
Minako smiled at her friend. &#39;Maybe this won&#39;t be as hard as I
thought.&#39; She thought to herself, smiling as a plan began to form in
her head. &#39;Just you wait Mako-chan, soon you&#39;ll have the love you&#39;ve
always dreamed of, and neither one of us will ever be alone again.&#39;

Sorry this is so short Minna. I want to thank my adopted little sister
Heather McCoy for helping me through my writer&#39;s block. The next
chapter should be longer. Thanks for you patience. Until next time.
