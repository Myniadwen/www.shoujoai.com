Finally, Haruka and Michiru are NOT cousins.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

She slid the door to the patio closed.  Finding herself in the 
living room, she looked around, touching every object.  Her delicate 
hands caressed the strings of a violin on display on a table.  She 
touched the dried oils of a painting, a seascape of savage intensity and 
stormy hue.  A plaque commemorating first place in a regional moto-cross 
race was next to it.  Doubt began to creep into her mind.  Was this as 
good an idea as she&#39;d first thought?

&quot;Michiru,&quot; Haruka said, mildly surprised as she entered the room.  
The green-tressed woman jumped.  &quot;I thought you were going to be gone 
all day.&quot;

&quot;I guess not,&quot; she said with a nervous laugh.

&quot;Is something wrong?&quot; Haruka asked.  &quot;You look nervous as a cat.&quot;

&quot;No, I&#39;m,&quot; she began, &quot;no.  I don&#39;t know.&quot;

&quot;You don&#39;t sense any trouble, do you?&quot;

&quot;No, no, nothing like that!  I&#39;m just - - I don&#39;t know, not 
myself?&quot;

&quot;Then come here,&quot; Haruka smiled, extending her arms.  &quot;Let me be 
your calming influence for a change.&quot;

She watched Michiru, dressed in a white summer blouse and yellow 
skirt, walk almost shyly to her.  Haruka gathered her up and she molded 
herself to the lanky blonde.  A pleasing coo came from lips pressed to 
her chest.  Once again the feel of her against Haruka&#39;s body made up for 
everything Haruka had endured for all of her years.

&quot;Ooh, I love the smell of that cologne,&quot; Haruka heard her sigh.

&quot;You ought to - - you bought it for me.&quot;

&quot;Well then, I have very good taste,&quot; she replied and giggled 
girlishly.

&quot;That&#39;s the first time I&#39;ve ever heard you giggle like that,&quot; 
Haruka remarked as she led them over to the sofa. 
 
&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said quickly.

&quot;Don&#39;t be sorry,&quot; Haruka smiled, sitting them both down.  &quot;It just 
surprised me.&quot;  She looked at her lover, perplexed by the woman&#39;s 
unusual behavior.  &quot;Are you drunk?&quot;

&quot;What kind of a question is that?&quot; she fumed.  &quot;One giggle and I&#39;m 
drunk?&quot;  She started to pull away.

&quot;OK, OK, I&#39;m sorry!&quot; Haruka said, pulling her back.  &quot;Don&#39;t get 
pouty!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not pouty!&quot;  She fought to escape, but Haruka had her trapped 
in her arms.

&quot;Oh no, not you,&quot; the blonde teased.  Seeing she wasn&#39;t mollified, 
Haruka sighed.  &quot;Michiru, I&#39;m sorry.  Don&#39;t be mad.&quot;

The woman sagged against Haruka.  &quot;No, it&#39;s me.  I guess I&#39;m not 
acting very normally, huh?  I&#39;m just, well, not myself today.&quot;

&quot;You said that,&quot; Haruka grinned.  &quot;Here, I&#39;ll kiss it and make it 
all better.&quot;

Haruka leaned in and sought out her lover&#39;s lips.  She felt 
Michiru tremble beneath her as their mouths pressed together.  But after 
a few moments, the woman began to return the kiss with ardor of her own.  
Their torsos pressed together and Haruka could feel the woman&#39;s nipples 
rubbing through her blouse, through Haruka&#39;s shirt and against her own.

&quot;You taste different,&quot; Haruka sighed, her husky voice thick with 
passion.

&quot;Stop analyzing things,&quot; she gasped and jammed her mouth to 
Haruka&#39;s.

They embraced again, Haruka&#39;s skin tingling as she felt Michiru&#39;s 
hands skittering up and down her neck and back.  Haruka slid her hands 
along Michiru&#39;s torso and up her breasts.  She braced her palms against 
the swell of the woman&#39;s bust and teased the nipples with her thumbs.

&quot;Oh!&quot; the green-haired woman gasped and giggled into Haruka&#39;s 
mouth.  &quot;You are such a bad boy - - um, girl.&quot;

&quot;Well, you like bad girls,&quot; rumbled Haruka.

&quot;No, I like good girls,&quot; she responded proudly, then smirked.  
&quot;But bad girls will do in a pinch.&quot;

&quot;Pinch, huh?&quot; leered Haruka.  Her hand sought Michiru&#39;s ass and 
the woman jumped and gasped in shock.  Haruka then threw her down on the 
sofa and pinned her, Michiru giggling helplessly underneath her.  She 
kissed and licked Michiru&#39;s chest while she massaged the woman&#39;s 
breasts.  Her lover&#39;s eyes rolled up in her head and she began moaning, 
wriggling beneath Haruka.  She felt her lover&#39;s hands fold around her 
head, gently hugging it to her chest as her lips worked the velvet soft 
skin.

&quot;Haruka,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Can-can we go into the bedroom?&quot;

Haruka rose up and smiled at Michiru.
  
&quot;Since when do you have to ask?&quot;

The sandy blonde got up and extended her hand to Michiru.  She 
took it, her eyes never leaving Haruka&#39;s.  Haruka backed to the bedroom, 
leading Michiru as if they were on a ballroom dance floor.  Once inside, 
she pulled off her knit polo shirt.  Having gone bra-less that day, she 
undid her belt and wiggled out of her slacks.  Stepping out of the 
pants, she noticed Michiru staring at her.  The woman seemed entranced, 
almost awestruck.

&quot;What?&quot; Haruka asked, smiling but puzzled.

&quot;Just,&quot; she said vacantly, shaking herself out of her trance, 
&quot;just reminding myself how lucky I am.  You are so,&quot; and she stopped 
short, as if she was mentally editing, &quot;exquisite.&quot;

A broad smile bloomed on Haruka&#39;s face.  She crossed over to her 
companion.

&quot;I think I&#39;m the one who&#39;s supposed to be saying that to you,&quot; 
leered Haruka.  &quot;You planning on getting out of those clothes soon?&quot;

Michiru seemed to tense for a moment of indecision, then grew an 
audacious smile.  &quot;I&#39;ll let you undress me.&quot;

Haruka arched an eyebrow.  &quot;You&#39;re being the glutton today.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m entitled,&quot; she responded regally.

Haruka circled behind her.  Her hands reached around and took hold 
of the button at Michiru&#39;s bodice.  She undid the button slowly, 
deliberately, allowing her hands to linger.  Her lover took in a deep 
breath and her breast swelled up into Haruka&#39;s hands.  As she moved to 
the next button, Haruka buried her face in the mane of green hair, 
seeking out Michiru&#39;s neck.  When she found it, her lips caressed the 
soft skin.

She heard Michiru&#39;s breath shudder out.  She felt Michiru&#39;s ass 
grind into her abdomen.  Michiru had always been responsive, but today 
she was the way she was when they first became lovers - - shy like a 
young girl, but eager once the surface shyness was worn away.

The blouse came open.  Haruka slid it down Michiru&#39;s shoulders 
amid a sexy wiggle from her and discarded it.  Her hands came up and 
brushed the woman&#39;s bra straps down her shoulders.  Michiru&#39;s breasts 
popped free, but Haruka ignored them.  With her right hand, she traced 
the line of her lover&#39;s stomach lightly while her left expertly undid 
the hooks, allowing the bra to fall away.

Using the flat of her hand, she backed Michiru up against her.  
Her nipples dug into Michiru&#39;s shoulders.  She kissed Michiru on the 
shoulder over and over.

&quot;Ohhh,&quot; the woman groaned.  &quot;You&#39;re going to drive me crazy.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s the whole point of the game,&quot; Haruka rumbled.

Haruka&#39;s hands slid down her partner&#39;s shimmying torso to her 
skirt.  She felt Michiru&#39;s arm fold around her head and she continued to 
nibble at the neck while she undid the skirt.  It slid down soft, creamy 
hips to the floor.  Haruka kept massaging Michiru&#39;s abdomen and Michiru 
kept squirming and wriggling against her.

&quot;MMMMMMMMM,&quot; she heard Michiru sigh.

Playfully, Haruka&#39;s hand slipped under the waistband of Michiru&#39;s 
panties.  She probed through the thatch of pubic hair until she found 
the woman&#39;s moist center.

&quot;AHHHHHHHHHH!&quot; she heard Michiru gasp.

Encouraged, Haruka&#39;s fingers began to rub between Michiru&#39;s legs.  
Her partner&#39;s squirming increased.  She seemed to dance to the tune 
Haruka was playing on her.  She could feel Michiru&#39;s breath quickening, 
coming out in excited little pants.  Michiru&#39;s hand folded over 
Haruka&#39;s, the fabric of the panty between them.  Whether she was seeking 
to control Haruka&#39;s movements or merely keep them in place, the woman 
didn&#39;t know.  It didn&#39;t matter.  She was running this exercise.  When 
she thought Michiru couldn&#39;t take anymore, Haruka&#39;s fingers penetrated. 

&quot;UMMMMMMMM!&quot; she heard Michiru squeal.

Suddenly Michiru wrenched around in Haruka&#39;s grasp until they were 
face to face.  She pressed her hands to either side of Haruka&#39;s face, 
staring up into her with sea green eyes dancing with lust and excitement.

&quot;Come to bed,&quot; Michiru whispered hoarsely.  &quot;Let me make love to 
you.&quot;

Michiru led her to the bed and eased down.  Reclining onto her 
back. She invited Haruka to her.  After stripping off her panties, 
Haruka climbed on top of her.  Their mouths joined.  As they kissed, 
Haruka felt hands press to her breasts and began massaging them.  The 
stimulation sent her soaring and Haruka pulled her mouth from Michiru&#39;s 
to moan.  Michiru upped the ante by raising her right thigh up between 
Haruka&#39;s legs.  The flesh of her thigh pressed to the flesh between 
Haruka&#39;s legs.  With a wicked grin, Michiru began moving her thigh back 
and forth.

&quot;MMMPH!&quot; grunted Haruka.  &quot;N-no fair . . .!&quot;  Michiru only laughed 
at that.

She pressed lightly but insistently on Haruka&#39;s chest.  Haruka got 
the message and rolled onto her back.  Michiru rose up on her knees and 
wiggled out of her panties.  The movement danced in Haruka&#39;s eyes.  Then 
Michiru bent down and planted a very loving kiss on Haruka&#39;s breastbone.  
Shooting a naughty glance at Haruka, she began kissing a line down 
Haruka&#39;s abdomen until she reached the blonde&#39;s erogenous zone.

Straddling Haruka, she bent in and began lightly probing with her 
tongue.  Listening to the timber of Haruka&#39;s responses to gauge her 
reaction, she found the woman&#39;s most responsive spot and began 
assaulting it with her mouth.

Haruka could feel her chest tighten.  The back of her head 
burrowed into her pillow and her eyes jammed shut.  Needing something to 
do with her hands, she sought out her nipples and rubbed them, 
intensifying the experience.  She did it until she couldn&#39;t stand it any 
longer, then she reached up and clutched the cheeks of Michiru&#39;s ass.  
As the muscles between her own legs clenched, she squeezed Michiru&#39;s 
cheeks, kneading them.

Moments later, after the shriek of Haruka&#39;s orgasm had died out in 
the room, she grabbed Michiru by the hips and pulled the woman to her.  
Amid Michiru&#39;s playful squeals, Haruka draped a leg over the woman&#39;s 
chest to pin her, wedged the woman&#39;s legs open with her arms and gave 
her as good as she got.

Michiru squealed.  She squirmed.  She gasped and begged and 
groaned.  She thrashed under Haruka&#39;s weight, the pitch of her responses 
growing higher with every stroke of Haruka&#39;s tongue.  It was odd, Haruka 
thought as she licked: Michiru was usually very cool and controlled 
during sex, but today she was like a demonstrative child, expressing the 
passion she was experiencing with youthful vigor and abandon.

&quot;Oh no!&quot; she shrieked, tensing all over.  &quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no, 
OHHHHHHH!&quot;  Michiru dissolved into gasping giggles as her climax swept 
over her.

&quot;You sounded like you enjoyed that,&quot; Haruka smiled, rolling her 
leg off of her.

&quot;Oh!&quot; Michiru chirped, vigorously popping up to a sitting position.  
&quot;That was fun!&quot;  Her smile was ear to ear and her front teeth bit 
lightly into her lower lip.  Giggling, she dived at Haruka and nestled 
up next to the woman.

&quot;Hold me,&quot; Michiru whispered, burrowing up against Haruka&#39;s chest.  
&quot;Hold me like you love me.&quot;

&quot;Ask me to do something hard,&quot; Haruka said.  She folded her arms 
around Michiru and kissed the top of her head.

------------------------------------------------------------

A little later, Michiru&#39;s stirring woke Haruka from the light 
sleep she&#39;d drifted into.  Her green-haired love goddess climbed out of 
bed and began dressing.

&quot;Going somewhere?&quot; Haruka asked.

&quot;I&#39;ve, uh, got to get back,&quot; Michiru said apologetically.  &quot;I want 
to stay, but . . .&quot;

&quot;I know,&quot; teased Haruka.  &quot;You love &#39;em and leave &#39;em types are 
all the same.&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not like that!&quot; huffed Michiru, playfully swatting Haruka&#39;s 
shoulder.  &quot;Michiru loves you!&quot;  She froze for a second.

&quot;Well, Haruka loves Michiru,&quot; grinned Haruka.

Michiru turned to go.  She paused at the door and looked back.  
Haruka noticed a note of melancholy in the woman&#39;s eye, but an approving 
smile on her face.

Rising once Michiru was gone, Haruka dressed and found an auto 
race on television.  About two hours later, Michiru entered through the 
front door.  Haruka looked up at her and flashed her a warm smile.

&quot;What are you so pleased about?&quot; Michiru asked, noticing the 
Cheshire grin on her companion.

------------------------------------------------------------

Luna woke when she heard Usagi ascending the stairs.  She stood up 
on the bed and confronted the girl when she entered the bedroom.

&quot;Where have you been?&quot; Luna demanded.

&quot;Around,&quot; Usagi replied with a suspiciously knowing smile.

&quot;Um hmm.  And what were you doing with the Disguise Pen?&quot;

&quot;Oh, nothing,&quot; Usagi maddeningly smirked again.

&quot;Usagi, I&#39;ve warned you repeatedly not to use that pen for 
personal . . .&quot;

The phone interrupted.  Usagi pounced on it and sat down on the 
bed.  Luna jumped to avoid being sat on.

&quot;Hello,&quot; chirped Usagi, hoping it was one of her friends.

&quot;Hey, Dumpling.  It&#39;s me,&quot; she heard Haruka say on the other end.  
&quot;I just called to thank you for this afternoon.  It was everything I 
thought it would be.&quot;

Luna watched with growing amusement as Usagi&#39;s eyes bulged out and 
her cheeks flushed bright red while cradling the phone to her ear.  She 
didn&#39;t know exactly what was going on, but whatever Usagi had done had 
just blown up in her face and it would be a long, long time until she 
tried it again.

It gave the little cat a gratifying sense of satisfaction.
