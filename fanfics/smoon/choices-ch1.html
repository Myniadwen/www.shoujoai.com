<pre>	&quot;Oh my gosh, Odango-chan is going to be here soon and I&#39;m still 
not ready!&quot; Hotaru thought to herself. She had spent all afternoon 
cleaning the house, setting up candles, and cutting fresh roses from the 
back yard to create a perfect romantic atmosphere.
	&quot;Today&#39;s the day.&quot; Hotaru said to herself nervous yet excited
	&quot;The day for what?&quot; Michiru asked as she entered the room. &quot;Mmm . 
. . the roses smell wonderful, and everything looks so nice and 
romantic. What&#39;s the occasion?&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;ll find out soon enough. For now why don&#39;t you and Haruka-
papa go Christmas shopping? You DID say you were going shopping RIGHT?&quot; 
Hotaru hinted.
	&quot;Oh, ok, I guess we&#39;ll leave you and your girlfriend alone for the 
night. Actually, we won&#39;t be home tonight. We&#39;re going to visit a friend 
out of town and we&#39;ll be staying there. We&#39;ll be back tomorrow around 
noon.&quot; Haruka said wrapping her arm around Michiru&#39;s waist.
	&quot;Just don&#39;t burn the house down with all these candles.&quot; Michiru 
teased. &quot;Well we better get going before it gets too late. Have fun 
Taru!&quot; 
	&quot;Bye Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa! Have fun at your friend&#39;s 
house!&quot; Hotaru yelled as the pair walked out the door.
	&quot;Phew . . . safe at last.&quot; Hotaru sighed as she placed the last 
rose in place on top of a card addressed to ChibiUsa. 
	Hotaru was waiting in the living room when she heard ChibiUsa&#39;s 
soft footsteps outside the front door. Hotaru rushed to the door and 
opened it just as ChibiUsa reached it.
	&quot;Taru-chan!&quot; ChibiUsa squealed as she threw herself into Hotaru&#39;s 
arms.
	&quot;Calm down munchkin, you&#39;re gonna break me in two!&quot; Hotaru teased. 
&quot;I have something very special planned for us tonight. You DID get 
permission to stay over right?&quot;
	&quot;Of course I did Taru-chan, would I ever let you down? So what&#39;s 
the plan?&quot; ChibiUsa asked curiously.
	&quot;You&#39;ll see my Odango-chan. I can&#39;t tell you or it won&#39;t be a 
surprise. For starters, why don&#39;t you follow that trail of rose petals?&quot; 
Hotaru said.
	&quot;Oh Taru, you didn&#39;t have to do all this for me.&quot; ChibiUsa replied 
as she followed the trail of rose petals. &quot;Ohhhhh . . . it&#39;s so 
beautiful. You did all this yourself Taru-chan? Just for me? You&#39;re so 
sweet!&quot; ChibiUsa exclaimed absorbing the beautiful candlelight and 
roses.
	&quot;I thought you would like it.&quot; Hotaru replied wrapping her arms 
around ChibiUsa and kissing her on the neck. &quot;There&#39;s a card for you 
there on the table.&quot;
	ChibiUsa opened the card and read it:

To my forever love on this special day.
My every thought and dream is of nothing but you.
I spend the hours of the day wishing for the day to come
When you and I can live together hand in hand, side by side,
As lovers, lifelong partners, and most of all the best of friends
For an eternity in our gorgeous realm.
That day when we can walk together beside a sparkling blue stream
And make love in the meadows surrounding it.
Watching butterflies flutter from flower to flower 
Drinking the sweet nectar found within.
Similar to the way you and I drink of each others love and passion.
I want to hold you and kiss you and touch you, 
But most of all I want to love you
With every last inch of my soul.

Love always,
Taru-chan

	Hotaru saw the tears well up in ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes. As one tear 
trickled down the pink-haired girl&#39;s cheek, Hotaru caught it with her 
finger and then licked it off. She turned ChibiUsa around to face her, 
and without a word, she placed a gentle kiss on ChibiUsa&#39;s pouting lips. 
&quot;I love you Odango-chan.&quot;
	ChibiUsa smiled and her face lit up as she answered, &quot;I love you 
too my Taru-chan!&quot;
	&quot;Did you like the card my love?&quot; Hotaru asked.
	&quot;Like??? I LOVED it!!!!! You&#39;re so sweet! I don&#39;t know what to say 
. . .&quot; ChibiUsa trailed off as Hotaru spoke.
	&quot;Don&#39;t say anything, just kiss me.&quot; Hotaru said.
	ChibiUsa pulled Hotaru closer and kissed her with more passion and 
love than ever before.
	Hotaru moaned noticing ChibiUsa&#39;s extreme wave of emotion. She had 
never seen ChibiUsa this passionate, and she liked it. Hotaru lost 
herself in ChibiUsa&#39;s embrace and before she knew it her skirt was on 
the floor along with her shirt and she was holding a naked ChibiUsa in 
her arms.
	ChibiUsa reached a hand behind Hotaru&#39;s back and unsnapped her bra 
while her lips were still locked in a sweet kiss. Her hand then cupped 
one of Hotaru&#39;s perfectly shaped breasts and squeezed gently. 
	Hotaru whimpered wanting more so ChibiUsa broke the kiss and, 
pulling the raven-haired girl to the floor, placed her mouth on Hotaru&#39;s 
rosey pink nipple. She began to suck Hotaru&#39;s nipple as she pinched and 
rubbed the other with her delicate fingers.
	&quot;Oh, Odango-chan! I love you so much!&quot; Hotaru exclaimed, trailing 
a finger down ChibiUsa&#39;s belly all the way to her center.
	ChibiUsa shivered with pleasure as Hotaru&#39;s finger brushed her 
clitoris. In response, she squeezed Hotaru&#39;s breasts and thrust her hips 
forward causing the raven-haired girl&#39;s whole hand to rub against her 
pearl. 
	Hotaru slipped a finger inside Hotaru&#39;s love channel and felt the 
velvety lining. 
	ChibiUsa held tight to Hotaru as she released her love juices.
	Hotaru laid down on the ground and pulled ChibiUsa over her so 
that she could lick the cum from ChibiUsa&#39;s love tunnel.
	At the same time, ChibiUsa reached over and rubbed Hotaru&#39;s cunt 
while running her tongue along the edges of her lover&#39;s belly button. 
	Hotaru moaned and her muscles contracted as ChibiUsa&#39;s kisses 
trailed closer to her woman&#39;s center. &quot;Oh, Odango-chan, taste me!&quot;
	ChibiUsa ran her tongue down the length of Hotaru&#39;s intimate place 
between her legs. Hotaru gasped as ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue entered her vagina 
and flickered in and out.
	Hotaru continued to lick the cum off of ChibiUsa as she rubbed her 
lover&#39;s clit with her fingers.
	Meanwhile, ChibiUsa was gently nipping at Hotaru&#39;s clitoris.
	The two girls reached their high and just before their orgasm, 
they sat up and rubbed their pearls against each other. They both came at 
the same time, feeling each others&#39; love juices trickle down their legs.
	&quot;Mmmmmm . . .&quot; ChibiUsa moaned, holding Hotaru tight.
	&quot;That was nice!&quot; Hotaru exclaimed with passion in her voice and 
love in her eyes.
	&quot;Yes it was. I love you Taru-chan!&quot; ChibiUsa replied as she pulled 
Hotaru closer.
	&quot;I love you too Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru said just before she was 
pulled into a kiss by ChibiUsa.
	As their lips parted, the girls both felt a new feeling. A feeling 
of passion and eternal love that was deeper than anything they had 
experienced before.
	Hotaru held ChibiUsa tight against her chest. Being careful not to 
let ChibiUsa notice, Hotaru stuck a ring in her own mouth. Without a 
word, Hotaru kissed ChibiUsa once more transferring the beautiful 
diamond ring into her lover&#39;s mouth. 
	ChibiUsa broke the kiss and took the object out of her mouth. As 
she held it up to look at it, Hotaru asked, &quot;Will you marry me Odango-
chan?&quot;
	ChibiUsa couldn&#39;t speak. She could only look at Hotaru with love 
filling her beautiful red eyes. Her smile itself was enough to show what 
her answer was. A tear fell from the pink-haired girl&#39;s eyes as she held 
out a beautiful sapphire ring and slipped it on her lover&#39;s ring finger. 
	Hotaru took the diamond ring ChibiUsa was holding and slipped it 
on her pink-haired lover&#39;s finger. &quot;I&#39;m gonna take that smile and the 
beautiful sapphire ring you gave me as a yes!&quot; Hotaru teased.
	ChibiUsa and Hotaru kissed passionately once more, both letting 
their tears of joy come forth. &quot;I love you so much Taru-chan!&quot; ChibiUsa 
breathed.
	&quot;I love you too my little Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru said still holding 
her lover tightly against her.
	The two girls held each other for what seemed an eternity before 
they finally headed towards the bed.

	The next morning ChibiUsa awoke to a glorious breakfast and a kiss 
from her lover. Hotaru had brought her breakfast in bed and was still 
completely naked.
	ChibiUsa blushed as she noticed that she too was still naked. 
&quot;You&#39;re so sweet for making me breakfast Taru-chan!&quot; ChibiUsa said 
thankfully.
	&quot;It&#39;s my pleasure Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru answered.
	ChibiUsa started to pick up a piece of toast, but it was snatched 
away by her lover. &quot;I&#39;m going to feed you. Don&#39;t lift a single one of 
those beautiful fingers.&quot;
	ChibiUsa did as she was told and waited for her lover to feed her.
	Hotaru lifted a piece of toast to ChibiUsa&#39;s lips.
	As ChibiUsa took a bite, Hotaru felt a wave of passion rush 
through her. &quot;Damn, she can turn me on just by eating!&quot; Hotaru thought.
	Hotaru continued to feed her lover until the plate was cleaned 
off. She then set everything aside and crawled over on top of ChibiUsa 
with passion in her eyes.
	ChibiUsa pulled Hotaru down to her in a passionate kiss.
	&quot;Mmmmmmmmm . . . you read my mind Odango-chan!&quot; Hotaru purred.
	&quot;Taru-chan, we need to go talk to my mother about our engagement. 
She&#39;ll probably have some issues to talk to us about. Besides, I&#39;m 
anxious to announce the news to everyone.&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;Good idea, my love. We can go talk to her today. Haruka-papa and 
Michiru-mama are getting home at noon. That&#39;s only in an hour. We should 
probably get dressed and clean up so we&#39;ll be ready to go when they get 
here.&quot; Hotaru replied.
	&quot;Okay as long as I get to dress you!&quot; ChibiUsa agreed.
	&quot;You can do whatever you want to sweetie&quot; Hotaru teased.
	&quot;Oooooooo&quot; ChibiUsa grinned. &quot;So I can do this?&quot; ChibiUsa asked as 
she squeezed Hotaru&#39;s breasts.
	&quot;Mmmmmmmm . . . as long as you don&#39;t mind me doing this&quot; Hotaru 
replied with a finger teasing her lover&#39;s clitoris.
	&quot;You&#39;re so naughty Taru-chan.&quot; ChibiUsa teased.
	&quot;Yeah, well you started it!&quot; Hotaru teased back.
	&quot;Okay, okay! Let&#39;s get dressed then.&quot; ChibiUsa replied as she 
slipped Hotaru&#39;s bra over her lover&#39;s arms and hooked it between her 
breasts.
	&quot;You like that don&#39;t you?&quot; Hotaru asked, watching the pink-haired 
girl&#39;s fingers linger between her breasts.
	&quot;Can you blame me?&quot; asked ChibiUsa smiling.
	&quot;I guess not&quot; Hotaru answered as she raised one hand to ChibiUsa&#39;s 
breasts.
	ChibiUsa purred as Hotaru&#39;s fingers stroked her delicate nipple. 
&quot;Taru-chan, you certainly know how to turn me on!&quot;
	&quot;Yes, but we better save that for later. Haruka-papa and Michiru-
mama will be home anytime now.&quot; Hotaru answered kissing her lover on the 
forehead.
	ChibiUsa nodded reluctantly and the girls continued to dress.

	When Haruka and Michiru walked into the house, they saw Hotaru and 
ChibiUsa wrapped in an intimate embrace. Haruka cleared her throat in 
amusement and watched as the girls pulled away from each other in 
embarrassment.
	&quot;Oh come on you two! It&#39;s not a secret that you girls are a 
couple. It&#39;s so obvious. We only tease you because you respond to it.&quot; 
Haruka said laughing.
	&quot;Even though everyone knows we&#39;re a couple, we prefer to keep our 
intimate moments private. You don&#39;t have to spy on us!&quot; Hotaru said 
aggravated. She was used to Haruka teasing her about her girlfriend, but 
she had always been hardheaded and hated to be beaten in a teasing match 
by anyone, especially Haruka.
	&quot;Oh, sorry, next time we&#39;ll kick a hole in the wall to our bedroom 
so we don&#39;t take a chance on walking in on you two.&quot; Haruka replied 
sarcastically.
	Hotaru glared at Haruka as ChibiUsa spoke, &quot;Michiru, we&#39;re going 
to go talk to my mother today about our engagement.&quot;
	Michiru smiled and said, &quot;So you two finally decided to tie the 
knot huh?&quot;
	&quot;Yes we did, we exchanged rings last night.&quot; Hotaru replied 
holding out her hand to display her beautiful sapphire engagement ring.
	Haruka and Michiru gasped as they examined the ring. &quot;It&#39;s 
beautiful!&quot; the two older girls said in unison.
	Michiru turned and asked &quot;How does yours look ChibiUsa?&quot;
	ChibiUsa held out her hand and Haruka and Michiru examined it with 
awe. &quot;It&#39;s gorgeous!&quot; Haruka said. 
	Michiru nodded in agreement. &quot;So you two are going to talk to your 
mother.&quot;
	&quot;Yes we want to receive her blessing and I&#39;m sure she will have 
some issues to discuss with us. She doesn&#39;t exactly know that Hotaru and 
I were planning to marry.&quot; ChibiUsa replied.
	&quot;I see&quot; Michiru said. &quot;Well, have fun and tell your mother I said 
hello!&quot;
	&quot;I will!&quot; ChibiUsa answered.
	&quot;Are you going to stay the night with ChibiUsa?&quot; Michiru asked 
Hotaru.
	&quot;Yes, of course!&quot; Hotaru grinned.
	&quot;Okay then. We&#39;ll see you girls tomorrow.&quot; Michiru answered.
	&quot;Bye Michiru-mama and Haruka-papa!&quot; Hotaru shouted as she headed 
out the door with ChibiUsa in tow.
	&quot;Bye&quot; Haruka and Michiru shouted back.
	
	Queen Serenity looked up from her papers as her maid announced her 
daughter and Hotaru.
	&quot;Thank you Aichiru, I will see them now.&quot;
	Princess Serenity entered holding Hotaru&#39;s hand. Queen Serenity 
motioned for the girls to take a seat, and they did.
	&quot;What was it you wanted to see me about, Small Lady?&quot;
	&quot;Mother, we need to have a serious talk.&quot; ChibiUsa replied.
	&quot;Has something happened???,&quot; the queen asked with concern.
	&quot;Sort of. Actually, I wanted to tell you that . . . well . . . I&#39;m 
in love with Hotaru, and she has proposed to me.&quot; ChibiUsa said with 
hesitation.
	&quot;That&#39;s impossible Small Lady, you must produce an heir when you 
take over the throne. I cannot allow you to marry a female.&quot; the queen 
replied firmly.
	&quot;That&#39;s what I wanted to talk to you about,&quot; ChibiUsa replied, 
&quot;Hotaru and I are in love mother, I want to marry her, but I wanted to 
ask you if you knew of any way we could marry and still produce an heir. 
I really want this mother. Hotaru is the only love I&#39;ve ever had and 
ever will have. Please help us mother.&quot;
	&quot;Well, there IS a way to make this work, but it&#39;s going to be 
difficult and it will take a lot of thinking on your part. I found out 
not long ago, that I was cloned from my mother&#39;s genes. Ami might be 
able to help you find a way like that. There&#39;re many other options along 
with that particular one, but they will be very difficult, and may bring 
on major changes to your lives. One option is to find a man who is 
willing to donate his sperm in order to impregnate you. You may not like 
that option, because it will be part of another&#39;s blood instead of the 
one you love. Yet another option is to adopt a child, but that won&#39;t 
really work out because your heir must be of your blood in order to bear 
the family symbol. These are the only options I know of . The choice is 
yours. Why don&#39;t you and Hotaru think hard and let me know your 
decision. Choose wisely, this decision will determine the future,&quot; 
replied the queen.
	&quot;Thank you mother, we will choose very carefully. May we be 
excused?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Yes, of course, my child.&quot; the queen smiled.
	&quot;Goodbye.&quot; the two girls shouted in sync.
	&quot;Goodbye.&quot; the queen replied in deep thought.

	Five minutes later the two girls rushed into ChibiUsa&#39;s bed 
chamber.
	&quot;Please see that no one disturbs us today.&quot; ChibiUsa said to her 
maid.
	&quot;Yes, your highness.&quot; the maid replied humbly and left the 
chambers.
	The girls sat on ChibiUsa&#39;s bed and looked at each other. 
	ChibiUsa looked down and said, &quot;Well, we need to decide what we 
want to do about this heir thing. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like you as a guy. 
I&#39;m too used to you being a girl.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, I know what you mean&quot; replied Hotaru. &quot;Well, I definitely 
don&#39;t want another person&#39;s sperm inside you.&quot;
	&quot;I know, I don&#39;t like that idea either. Adoption&#39;s out of the 
question. All we have left is cloning.&quot; ChibiUsa said in a mature voice.
	&quot;You know, I would love to have a daughter that looked just like 
you&quot; Hotaru said while staring at her true love.
	&quot;That would be kind of strange having a daughter just like me 
though. Why don&#39;t we have her look like you?&quot; ChibiUsa asked.
	&quot;Because I have a Saturn symbol on my forehead and the moon 
heiress must have a crescent moon symbol. She either has to look like 
you, or be a combination of both of us.&quot; Hotaru explained.
	&quot;That&#39;s a good idea! Why don&#39;t we do the combination clone? Then 
it would be as if we had the baby together as a man and woman would. 
That way we&#39;ll have a unique and beautiful daughter!&quot; ChibiUsa replied 
excitedly.
	Hotaru looked at ChibiUsa and then pulled her lover to her in a 
passionate kiss.
	&quot;I love you.&quot; Hotaru said lovingly as she held ChibiUsa in her 
arms.
	&quot;I love you too, Taru-chan&quot; ChibiUsa answered.
	Hotaru started to caress ChibiUsa&#39;s back and then ran a finger up 
her neck , behind her ear, down the front of her throat, and finally 
down to the neckline of her shirt. Hotaru looked into ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes 
and then kissed her as she began undoing the buttons on her lover&#39;s 
shirt. ChibiUsa kissed back just as passionately and did the same to 
Hotaru&#39;s shirt. The girls continued to undress each other and then fell 
into each other&#39;s naked bodies.
	&quot;You&#39;re beautiful.&quot; Hotaru whispered before ducking her head in 
order to take a nipple into her mouth. She began circling ChibiUsa&#39;s 
nipple with her tongue, and then took it into her mouth and suckled on 
it until it became rock hard. ChibiUsa moaned and moved her hips upward 
with passionate force.
	&quot;Taru-chan!!!&quot; ChibiUsa cried out. &quot;I want to give you pleasure as 
well.&quot; ChibiUsa&#39;s hand ran down Hotaru&#39;s chest and stomach and came to a 
halt at Hotaru&#39;s center. She started to stroke Hotaru&#39;s clit with her 
index finger. A moan escaped from Hotaru&#39;s lips as she brought them down 
to kiss ChibiUsa. Hotaru felt a finger slip inside of her and it filled 
her with unexplainable pleasure. Her kiss grew deeper and more 
passionate as ChibiUsa&#39;s finger began to move inside of her.
	&quot;Odango-chan, you have no idea how sexy and beautiful you are.&quot; 
Hotaru whispered as their lips parted. &quot;I want to taste you.&quot;
	&quot;Oh, Hotaru-chan, I want to taste you too.&quot; ChibiUsa answered. 
&quot;How bout we taste each other together?&quot;
	&quot;Mmmmmm . . . good idea.&quot; Hotaru agreed.
	ChibiUsa straddled Hotaru so that she would have easy access to 
her sex. She then bent down and licked Hotaru&#39;s petals as Hotaru did the 
same to her. ChibiUsa cried out as Hotaru thrust her tongue deep inside 
her. Noticing Hotaru&#39;s moistness she began to suck on her clit. 
	Hotaru moaned as ChibiUsa slipped two fingers inside her love 
tunnel while at the same time still paying attention to her clit. In 
response, Hotaru gently nipped at ChibiUsa&#39;s petals and clitoris and 
then gently licked her opening.
	ChibiUsa shivered with a flood of pleasure as she held back her 
orgasm. &quot;Oh Taru-chan, I don&#39;t think I can hold it for much longer with 
you doing that!&quot; ChibiUsa whispered. 
	Hotaru took the whole of ChibiUsa&#39;s sex into her mouth and 
swallowed every last drop of her love juices. &quot;Odango-chan, you taste so 
sweet and you&#39;re sooo sexy!&quot; Hotaru cried just as ChibiUsa plunged her 
tongue deep into her lover&#39;s wetness.
	The girls were both dripping with desire as they grew closer to 
ecstasy. Hotaru plunged three fingers into ChibiUsa&#39;s love channel 
while, at the same time, rubbing her clit rapidly.
	ChibiUsa cried out and rubbed Hotaru&#39;s clit rapidly as well while 
plunging her tongue into Hotaru&#39;s velvety pink sex.
	Both girls shivered and moaned as they reached their climax.
	&quot;Taru-chan! I want you to cum with me!&quot; ChibiUsa shouted.
	&quot;I&#39;m ready!&quot; Hotaru answered.
	The girls began to shiver as they came together, and then panting, 
collapsed in each others arms.
	&quot;Mmmmmm . . . that felt so good.&quot; ChibiUsa said in a loving tone.
	&quot;Yes it was. We&#39;ll have to continue later after we&#39;ve gotten our 
strength back.&quot; Hotaru replied.
	&quot;My love, we&#39;re finally going to be married! We&#39;ll have a child of 
our own! We&#39;ll rule this queendom together! Isn&#39;t it wonderful?&quot; 
ChibiUsa asked excitedly.
	&quot;Yes it will be perfect. You and I together forever. The way it 
was meant to be. I love you Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru stated tenderly as she 
placed a kiss on the top of ChibiUsa&#39;s head.
	&quot;I love you too Taru-chan. With all my heart.&quot; ChibiUsa replied.
	Hotaru held ChibiUsa to her chest as she spoke, &quot;So the problem of 
an heir is solved. Nothing can stand between us now. Let&#39;s announce our 
decision to OUR mother.&quot; &lt;3

	ChibiUsa and Hotaru were sitting while Ami continued to explain to 
them what it was she was working on. They were both bored because they 
didn&#39;t understand a thing Ami was saying. They&#39;d come to her for help on 
how exactly they could have a child. ChibiUsa had moved from the 
uncomfortable chair she had been sitting on, to Hotaru&#39;s lap, which she 
thought was much more comfortable in the first place. Ami hadn&#39;t seemed 
to notice as she continued on with her explanation.
	&quot;Umm.... Ami?&quot; ChibiUsa spoke up, interrupting Ami. 
	Ami looked over to ChibiUsa. &quot;Yes, ChibiUsa?&quot; 
	&quot;Could you help us? We&#39;re trying to find a way so Taru-chan and I 
can... so we can have a child,&quot; ChibiUsa finally got out. 
	&quot;Oh....&quot; Ami said, trying to suppress her surprise at their 
request. &quot;I&#39;ll see what I can do to help.&quot;
	&quot;Thank you Ami!&quot; Hotaru said gratefully. &quot;We really appreciate 
it.&quot;
	ChibiUsa nodded. &quot;Yeah. We needed some help on this.&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t mention it. I&#39;d love to help. Let me think about it for a 
little bit. There are a couple things the two of you could do.&quot;
	&quot;We thought about that. We want the baby to be ours, though,&quot; 
Hotaru said.
	&quot;Okay. That rules out artificial insemination. Well, if one of you 
was a male, you could have the child that way. Similar to how we thought 
the Sailor Starlights could change. They wound up just being women, 
though, so we&#39;d have to find some way to do that.&quot; Ami said. &quot;Whichever 
one of you became male would most likely have to pass on your Sailor 
Crystal to the baby, assuming its a girl. I can see this being pretty 
complex.&quot;
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about that being too complex then. We&#39;d rather both 
stay girls anyway,&quot; ChibiUsa said nervously. She didn&#39;t like how their 
options were sounding.
	&quot;Hmmm....&quot; Ami looked deep in thought.
	&quot;Usa-chan and I were thinking about cloning. Is there anything we 
could do about that?&quot; Hotaru asked hopefully.
	&quot;Cloning? Yeah, that would work. But who would you have as a 
daughter? You or ChibiUsa?&quot; Ami asked.
	The two younger girls looked at each other. ChibiUsa shrugged 
helplessly. Hotaru stared at her for a moment. ChibiUsa sighed and spoke 
up. &quot;We were kinda hoping that maybe our daughter could be a clone of 
both of us instead of just one.&quot;
	Ami thought about it for a moment. &quot;I guess that would work. I&#39;d 
have to check into it, but I&#39;ll see what I can do. We should be able to 
combine your genes and Hotaru&#39;s so the child can be a part of both of 
you.&quot;
	ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru both looked over to Ami. &quot;Really?&quot; Hotaru 
smiled. &quot;Thank you, Ami-chan.&quot;
	&quot;Yes. Thanks, Ami,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.
	&quot;Don&#39;t mention it, you two. I&#39;ll try my best. It should be easy 
enough. I&#39;ll get back to you both pretty soon. I just want to go over a 
few things before you go through with it.&quot; Ami walked the two girls to 
the door.
	&quot;Don&#39;t work too hard Ami-chan,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;And tell Mako-chan we said hi,&quot; Hotaru added.
	&quot;Okay you two. Now I&#39;ve got some work to do if you want to have a 
child, so I&#39;ll see you later.&quot; Ami waved to Hotaru and ChibiUsa as they 
walked off.

	ChibiUsa and Hotaru were eating in the Crystal Tokyo Mall 
food court when Makoto and Minako walked up and sat down.
	&quot;Hey girls! What&#39;s happening?&quot; Makoto asked as she slapped a hand 
on ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulder. &quot;Ami told me you all were asking her for some 
help, but she wouldn&#39;t tell me what it was all about. Do you mind 
filling us in?&quot; Makoto asked puzzled.
	&quot;Ummmmmm . . . heheh . . . well . . .&quot; ChibiUsa stuttered.
	&quot;Well what? You&#39;re just like your mother used to be. Always 
keeping secrets and so obvious when you&#39;re hiding something.&quot; Makoto 
teased.
	A sweat drop formed behind ChibiUsa&#39;s head as she remembered what 
a ditz her mom was when she went back to the past. &quot;Well . . . I&#39;m not 
gonna keep this a secret for long, Hotaru and I are gonna tell everybody 
at the next scout meeting. I promise. Isn&#39;t that right Hotaru?&quot; ChibiUsa 
looked at Hotaru hopefully.
	&quot;Of course ChibiUsa. We wouldn&#39;t keep this a secret for the 
world!&quot; Hotaru said anxiously.
	&quot;Cool!&quot; Makoto said stealing a fry from ChibiUsa.
	Everyone covered their ears as ChibiUsa let out an ear piercing 
wail, &quot;Mako! You little thief!!! Nobody takes my fooooooood!!!!!!!&quot; 
	ChibiUsa started chasing Makoto around the table while Minako ate 
more of ChibiUsa&#39;s fries.
	&quot;Minako, that&#39;s not very nice stealing ChibiUsa&#39;s fries while 
she&#39;s distracted. It&#39;s an unfair advantage. Besides you know how 
monstrous her appetite is.&quot; Hotaru said as she switched fries with 
ChibiUsa. &quot;Now leave those fries alone, you can have some of mine.&quot;
	ChibiUsa had Makoto on the ground and was sitting on her back 
trying to pull her legs up so she couldn&#39;t try to get up.
	&quot;ChibiUsa, are you amusing yourself? I swear you and your mother 
are one of a kind. It&#39;s amazing. The resemblance I mean.&quot; Minako said 
with a smirk.
	ChibiUsa stuck her tongue out at Minako and Minako did the same 
back.
	&quot;Okay you two, quit it and let me go!&quot; Makoto yelled.
	&quot;Yes ma&#39;am&quot; ChibiUsa teased and got off of Makoto.
	&quot;You ready to do some serious shopping Makoto?&quot; Minako asked 
excitedly as she pulled Makoto behind her toward Victoria&#39;s Secret.
	&quot;Oh geez . . .&quot; Makoto remarked. &quot;Bye Hotaru! Bye ChibiUsa! Have 
fun you two!&quot;
	&quot;Bye!&quot; the girls said simultaneously.
	&quot;Oh Hotaru, this is the moment we&#39;ve been waiting for. To spill 
the beans to the whole gang! I can&#39;t wait till the next scout meeting.&quot; 
ChibiUsa said excitedly. 
	&quot;I know.&quot; Replied Hotaru, &quot;I&#39;m so happy. We&#39;re going to have a 
child together. I&#39;ve always wanted to marry you and have a child with 
you.&quot;
	&quot;We have to make wedding plans and then we have to make plans for 
the baby! We have a lot to do!!!! Let&#39;s go talk to Ami tomorrow and see 
what she&#39;s found out.&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;That&#39;s a good idea, but I don&#39;t want you to stress out about this 
my love. We have as much time as we need to get everything done. You are 
much prettier when you&#39;re worry-free and in bed with me.&quot; Hotaru hinted 
with a mischievous grin.
	&quot;All right honey, I won&#39;t worry about it. Let&#39;s go home.&quot; ChibiUsa 
replied. &quot;That&#39;s what I&#39;m talking about!&quot; Hotaru answered as both girls 
ran towards the mall exit holding hands.

	ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru kissed passionately as they entered the room 
they shared. They stopped when they noticed one of ChibiUsa&#39;s 
handmaidens cleaning up the room. They both blushed when she turned to 
look at them. She stared at the lovers for a couple seconds before 
hurriedly finishing up what she was doing. She picked up all her things 
and started out of the room. She paused near the two of them before 
leaving. She put a hand on one of ChibiUsa&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Go get &#39;em, 
princess,&quot; she said. ChibiUsa blushed a deep crimson as the other girl 
giggled and left.
	The two girls stood in silence for a minute before Hotaru spoke 
up. &quot;What was that about?&quot; she asked. 
	&quot;That was Suki. I&#39;ve known her for years now. I guess she knew 
what we were planning on doing,&quot; ChibiUsa explained.
	&quot;Don&#39;t get the room too messy. I just cleaned it,&quot; Suki said 
teasingly from the doorway.
	ChibiUsa blushed again. &quot;Suki.....&quot; 
	&quot;I know, I know. I&#39;ll leave you two alone,&quot; the maid said. She 
waved to Hotaru before closing the door behind her. 
	Hotaru laughed and kissed ChibiUsa again, burying her fingers in 
the other girl&#39;s hair, slowly letting it out of her odango hairstyle. 
&quot;Well, I hope we don&#39;t get the room too messy then. I don&#39;t want her mad 
at me.&quot;
	ChibiUsa laughed a bit herself. Her hands went around Hotaru&#39;s 
waist. She smiled at the raven haired girl as she led her to the bed. 
&quot;You let me worry about that.&quot;
	Hotaru leaned forward and kissed the pink haired girl&#39;s soft lips 
as she was pushed onto the bed. ChibiUsa&#39;s hands went up from her sides 
and started slipping Hotaru&#39;s shirt over her head. She tossed Hotaru&#39;s 
shirt to the side while Hotaru pulled her skirt down her legs. Both 
girls continued to undress each other.
	&quot;Taru-chan?&quot; ChibiUsa asked distractedly. She slid her hand over 
Hotaru&#39;s bare stomach. &quot;Which one of us is going to have the baby?&quot;
	Hotaru was relishing the sense of ChibiUsa&#39;s touch across her bare 
skin. &quot;We&#39;ll decide that later, Usa-chan.&quot; She unclasped ChibiUsa&#39;s bra 
to reveal the sensuous skin underneath. ChibiUsa moaned lightly as 
Hotaru&#39;s hands caressed her breasts. Hotaru moaned as well when 
ChibiUsa&#39;s hand snuck under her panties, the pink haired princess&#39; 
fingers pushed tightly against the sensitive skin between Hotaru&#39;s legs. 
&quot;So that&#39;s how you want it,&quot; Hotaru said breathlessly. ChibiUsa smiled 
at her evilly and nodded. Hotaru let out a small gasp as ChibiUsa&#39;s 
fingers started rubbing up and down against her vagina. She shuddered as 
she felt ChibiUsa&#39;s hand run down her back before stopping at Hotaru&#39;s 
rear. Hotaru brought her hand up between ChibiUsa&#39;s bare legs. ChibiUsa 
spread her legs on either side of Hotaru as she bent down and kissed the 
dark haired girl. 
	&quot;Taru...&quot; ChibiUsa moaned. The dark haired girl always drove her 
crazy. Hotaru gently pinched one of her princess&#39; light pink nipples. 
ChibiUsa slowly pushed a finger into Hotaru. The raven haired girl 
started panting as ChibiUsa slowly slid her finger in and out of the 
other girl&#39;s most secret of places. Hotaru continued to rub between 
ChibiUsa&#39;s legs. She pulled ChibiUsa down further, almost urgently, 
bringing her lips to the pink haired girl&#39;s other nipple. The two lovers 
kept up their pace feverishly. 
	Hotaru slid under ChibiUsa so they were face to face. She ran her 
free hand across ChibiUsa&#39;s face. She was the most beautiful thing in 
the world to Hotaru. Violet eyes met crimson as Hotaru captured 
ChibiUsa&#39;s lips with her own. 
The raven haired girl moaned again as her pink haired lover increased 
the pace. She arched her back, wrinkling the soft sheets she was lying 
on top of. Hotaru tried to match the tempo ChibiUsa had set.  
	Hotaru&#39;s ivory skin glistened with sweat. Her pale cheeks were 
flushed. &#39;She&#39;s like an angel,&#39; ChibiUsa thought. &#39;My angel.&#39; ChibiUsa 
gasped as she felt Hotaru&#39;s fingers around her jewel. The heat in 
ChibiUsa grew from the other girl&#39;s touch. ChibiUsa continued her own 
ministrations while her free hand roamed over Hotaru&#39;s soft skin. 
Hotaru&#39;s panting became faster and she started thrusting her hips 
against her lover&#39;s fingers. Hotaru tried to concentrate as her 
forefinger and thumb caressed ChibiUsa&#39;s clitoris. The musky scent she 
could smell intoxicated her. The two girls continued their passionate 
love making, oblivious to everything but each other. 
	ChibiUsa could feel herself nearing her climax. She pushed her 
fingers further into Hotaru&#39;s vagina as she reached her orgasm, bringing 
Hotaru over the edge shortly after her. ChibiUsa collapsed on top of the 
raven haired girl. Hotaru put her arms around the other girl, kissing 
her lightly. They both rolled over on the bed. 
	Hotaru sighed contentedly as they held each other. She smiled to 
her princess. &quot;I love you, Usa-chan.&quot;
	&quot;I love you too, Taru,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily. She placed her head 
on Hotaru&#39;s shoulder, feeling a little tired. Her hand went back down to 
Hotaru&#39;s stomach. &quot;I&#39;m really excited about us having a baby, Hotaru.&quot;
	&quot;Me too,&quot; the dark haired girl replied, gently stroking her 
lover&#39;s soft pink hair. 
	&quot;Taru? Who&#39;s going to...&quot; ChibiUsa began.
	Hotaru silenced her with a kiss. &quot;We&#39;ll talk about that later, 
ChibiUsa,&quot; she said when she finished.  
	The pink haired girl smiled and held Hotaru closer. The two girls 
drifted off to a peaceful sleep in each other&#39;s arms. 

	
	The next morning, the two girls awoke by each other&#39;s sides. They 
kissed softly and then started to dress.
	&quot;Well Taru, today&#39;s a busy day. We have to tell everyone about our 
engagement. And then we have to decide what will happen with the wedding 
and the baby.&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;So, my little munchkin finally decided to tell everyone the we&#39;re 
engaged, huh? I knew ya could do it Odango-chan!&quot; Hotaru replied 
excitedly. &quot;Did you already call a meeting?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, I sent a message to all the scouts last night. We&#39;re meeting 
at Rei&#39;s temple.&quot; ChibiUsa grinned.
	&quot;So, when does this meeting take place my little love muffin?&quot; 
Hotaru asked teasingly.
	&quot;At lunch time of course. When else?&quot; ChibiUsa laughed.
	&quot;Of course! I should have known. My little piggy!&quot;
	A pillow smashed the back of Hotaru&#39;s head.
	&quot;Ouch, what was that for?&quot;
	&quot;For calling me piggy!&quot;
	&quot;Well excuse me!&quot; Hotaru said teasingly as she leapt at Hotaru and 
sent her flying onto her back on the bed. &quot;Hmm . . . I think I like that 
position Odango-chan.&quot; Hotaru said seductively.
	Before ChibiUsa could get out a single word she felt a hand 
between her legs. She let out a purr of pleasure. Hotaru placed her lips 
over ChibiUsa&#39;s and kissed her passionately. 
	&quot;OH, Taru-chan! I love you!&quot; ChibiUsa shouted as the kiss was 
broken.
	&quot;I love you too Odango-chan!&quot; Hotaru glanced at the beautiful ring 
on ChibiUsa&#39;s left ring finger and then at her own. &quot;This is gonna be a 
great life.&quot; She thought to herself. Hotaru kissed ChibiUsa softly once 
more and then helped her up. &quot;We&#39;re gonna be late if we don&#39;t hurry and 
finish getting ready.&quot;
	ChibiUsa sighed, &quot;You&#39;re right Taru-chan. Our intimate moment will 
just have to wait till later. By then the anxiety will be so built up, 
you won&#39;t be able to control me.&quot; ChibiUsa grinned wickedly.
	&quot;Oh, Odango-chan, you&#39;re such a little minx!&quot; Hotaru teased.
	

	Ami looked over the files that had all the information she needed 
to go over for cloning ChibiUsa &amp; Hotaru a daughter. She&#39;d done a few 
tests on Usagi to get a little more data as well. Ami was fascinated by 
the whole idea. Maybe she and Makoto... Ami&#39;s thoughts were cut off when 
she heard a rap on her door. She looked up, adjusting her reading 
glasses. &quot;Come in,&quot; she said. 
	The door opened and Hotaru walked in with a nervous looking 
ChibiUsa. &quot;Odango-chan, its not like they&#39;re going to do the procedure 
today. There&#39;s nothing to worry about,&quot; Hotaru said soothingly. ChibiUsa 
didn&#39;t look convinced. 
	&quot;It&#39;s okay, ChibiUsa. We&#39;re going to have the operation later. 
Right now I just wanted to go over a few things with you and Hotaru,&quot; 
Ami smiled reassuringly. 
	ChibiUsa smiled back, still a little nervous. &quot;That sounds good.&quot; 
She sat down in one of the chairs in front of Ami&#39;s desk. Hotaru took 
the seat beside her and put a hand on ChibiUsa&#39;s leg. She squeezed 
lightly, letting the pink haired girl know she was there for her, hoping 
she&#39;d feel better before the actual procedure came around. 
	&quot;Congratulations on the engagement, you two. We&#39;re all happy for 
you,&quot; Ami said. &quot;You two are perfect for each other.&quot; 
	ChibiUsa blushed. &quot;Thanks, Ami.&quot; Hotaru said excitedly. She was 
still surprised that she and ChibiUsa were getting married. She&#39;d never 
felt this good before. Hotaru could see that ChibiUsa was relaxing now. 
The pink haired girl was looking at her engagement ring, no longer 
looking as worried.
	&quot;I think I have everything just about set up,&quot; Ami stated. &quot;We 
just need to make sure everything&#39;s set up. You want this to be a mix of 
the two of you, right?&quot; 
	ChibiUsa and Hotaru nodded. &quot;We want it to be our baby,&quot; ChibiUsa 
said, smiling at Hotaru. 
	&quot;Which one of you is going to be pregnant with the baby?&quot; Ami 
asked.
	Hotaru looked over at Ami. &quot;Me.&quot; She knew ChibiUsa was nervous 
about the whole thing. She&#39;d gladly do it for the other girl.
	&quot;Hotaru,&quot; ChibiUsa spoke up. &quot;We already talked about this. You 
were so frail when you were younger. I don&#39;t want anything to happen to 
you or the baby. I couldn&#39;t forgive myself if anything happened.&quot; The 
pink haired girl looked over at Ami. &quot;I&#39;ll have the baby.&quot;
	Hotaru sighed. ChibiUsa was right. It was safer for the baby this 
way. Their baby. She laid her hand atop ChibiUsa&#39;s. &quot;I know.&quot;
	&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Ami asked.
	ChibiUsa nodded. &quot;I&#39;m sure.&quot; She felt Hotaru squeeze her hand. She 
smiled at her dark haired lover, trying to ignore the butterflies in her 
stomach. 
	&quot;Okay. We need to come up with a few more details, but that just 
depends on your schedule and when we can get you down here for the 
procedure.&quot; Ami looked up and smiled at the younger women. &quot;You should 
start picking out a name soon.&quot;
	&quot;Or two,&quot; ChibiUsa said with a slight smile. Ami looked puzzled.
	&quot;Ami, we were wondering if we could have twins, instead,&quot; Hotaru 
said after exchanging a glance with her lover. 
	&quot;You both want to have one? I don&#39;t think that&#39;s such a good idea. 
This will be a difficult experience for the two of you and I think 
you&#39;ll need a lot of support from the other. It would be better if one 
of you isn&#39;t dealing with all this right now,&quot; Ami explained. 
	&quot;No, I&#39;ll still have both of them,&quot; ChibiUsa said quickly. &quot;We 
just wanted to know if we could have twins.&quot;
	&quot;Is that what you want?&quot;
	Hotaru nodded. &quot;We stayed up talking about it. That&#39;s what we 
want.&quot;
	Ami marked a few things down. &quot;Alright, you two. I&#39;ll probably see 
you around the palace later to see when you can come in for this.&quot;
	&quot;Thanks, Ami-chan!&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.
	&quot;Arigatou, Ami,&quot; Hotaru said smiling. 
	&quot;Don&#39;t mention it. You two have a lot of work ahead of you, so I 
wish you luck.&quot; Ami smiled brightly at the two women. &quot;We still need to 
get the DNA from both of you, so we need to find out when we can do 
that. It&#39;ll still take a while to get everything ready, and we can hold 
off till after the wedding, but I&#39;d like to get started with your DNA at 
least.&quot;
	&quot;Okay, Ami-chan. We&#39;ll call soon,&quot; ChibiUsa waved at the blue 
haired genius. Hotaru was still holding ChibiUsa&#39;s other hand while she 
waved back. The two giddily exited Ami&#39;s office. 

	Ami smiled to herself after the door closed. Those girls were 
taking on a lot, but they didn&#39;t mind as long as it was together. She 
sighed and looked at the picture of herself and Makoto on her desk. Her 
fingertips gently brushed the cold glass of the frame. She looked up at 
the clock. She had plenty more work she could do. She looked back down 
at the picture. There were far more important things in life. She 
quickly picked up her things and headed out the door. 

	&quot;You&#39;re what?!&quot; Diana asked, surprised. She hopped off of Momoko&#39;s 
head, landing in front of Hotaru and ChibiUsa, and changed into her 
human form. The now human Diana looked from one girl to the other with 
curiosity brimming in her large, cat-like eyes. 
	Hotaru smiled at Diana&#39;s enthusiasm and squeezed ChibiUsa&#39;s hand 
in encouragement. ChibiUsa squeezed back before replying. She&#39;d already 
told her mother about the wedding and she&#39;d be telling the others soon 
enough. Right now she had to tell Diana, Momoko and her guardians, the 
Sailor Quartet. These were some of her closest friends. She willed the 
cold pit in her stomach to disappear as she prepared to answer Diana. 
	&quot;We&#39;re getting married,&quot; she repeated. 
	&quot;Married?&quot; Momoko looked shocked. 
	&quot;Its about time,&quot; VesVes grinned.
	&quot;Wow! Really?&quot; PallaPalla asked excitedly. She took a step 
forward, eager to hear more.
	&quot;So you two are finally tying the knot? Why didn&#39;t any of us see 
this coming?&quot; JunJun shook her head.
	CereCere smiled sweetly. &quot;Small Lady, we&#39;re all so happy for you.&quot; 
The pink haired member of the Sailor Quartet turned to Hotaru. &quot;I&#39;m sure 
you&#39;ll take good care of our princess.&quot;
	Hotaru laughed. &quot;Trust me, I intend to.&quot; Hotaru smiled inwardly. 
She felt like she&#39;d burst from the feelings building within her. Was 
anyone ever supposed to be this happy? The support and warmth from their 
friends just added to this perfect moment. She felt like her whole life 
had led up to this. All that pain and loneliness she&#39;d suffered through 
when she was younger was all made worth it. She felt like the scars on 
her soul had finally healed. The other girl had turned her whole life 
upside down and she wouldn&#39;t have had it any other way. She was finally 
going to marry the woman that meant more to her than life itself. That 
thought alone filled her with pure happiness.  She resisted the urge to 
hold the other girl tightly and tell her exactly how much she loved her, 
instead opting for her arm around ChibiUsa&#39;s waist with her body leaning 
against the pink haired princess. 
	ChibiUsa smiled brightly as she leaned in and kissed the dark 
haired girl softly in front of the small crowd of friends. 
	&quot;Awww... That&#39;s so cute,&quot; Diana said, breaking the silence. The two 
women blushed and cut the kiss short. Diana turned to Momoko. &quot;Momo-
chan, when are we going to get married?&quot; she asked, her eyes sparkling. 
	Momoko laughed nervously. &quot;Soon, soon. Don&#39;t worry about it, 
Diana.&quot;
	&quot;So when&#39;s the wedding going to be?&quot; JunJun asked.
	&quot;Pretty soon. We just need to start working everything out,&quot; Hotaru 
said happily. 
	&quot;I can help with the floral arrangements if you want,&quot; CereCere 
offered. 
	&quot;If she does, you&#39;ll find a lot of pictures of her all over your 
wedding,&quot; VesVes said in a stage whisper. CereCere lightly nudged her in 
the side. 
	&quot;PallaPalla wants to help!&quot; PallaPalla spoke up. &quot;It sounds like 
fun. I wanna help with anything you need me to.&quot; 
	&quot;Thanks, PallaPalla,&quot; ChibiUsa said smiling. &quot;Thank you all.&quot; Her 
voice faltered while she spoke with the deep emotion underneath.
	&quot;We just want the two of you to be happy. We&#39;re your friends,&quot; 
Momoko said. &quot;And besides, I could use the support for whenever Diana 
and I get married.&quot; The lavender haired girl laughed and winked at the 
two lovers.
	&quot;You need to get engaged first,&quot; JunJun mentioned.
	Diana&#39;s attention turned to the engagement rings Hotaru and 
ChibiUsa had on. She lifted up both of their hands to look at the two 
rings. &quot;They&#39;re so pretty,&quot; she said, admiring the engagement rings.  
ChibiUsa sighed happily, remembering how Hotaru had proposed to 
her. &#39;She&#39;s so sweet,&#39; she thought to herself. She looked at the dark 
haired girl and managed to catch her gaze. The two smiled at each other 
while everyone else talked. &#39;I love you,&#39; ChibiUsa mouthed to Hotaru. &#39;I 
love you, too,&#39; Hotaru mouthed back.


	The scouts were waiting at Rei&#39;s shrine for ChibiUsa and Hotaru to 
show up when they heard a loud noise outside the door. Rei got up and 
opened the door to see what had happened. Sprawled out on the ground in 
front of the temple was Rei&#39;s grandpa. From the ladder on top of her 
grandpa, Rei concluded that his grandpa had seen Hotaru and ChibiUsa 
walking towards the shrine while he was fixing the leak in the roof. 
Rei&#39;s grandpa had always been a horney old man who liked to check out 
young shapely girls. This happened every time. He&#39;d be checking out a 
girl while he was doing something, such as fixing the roof, and he&#39;d end 
up hurting himself in his distraction. Rei chuckled to herself before 
approaching her grandfather.
	&quot;Grandpa, why are you always so clumsy? You remind me of Usagi!&quot; 
Rei scolded her grandfather as she moved the ladder off of him. &quot;You saw 
ChibiUsa and Hotaru didn&#39;t you?&quot; Rei laughed.
	&quot;Boy, did I.&quot; Her grandpa answered wide eyed and red in the face.
	&quot;Uhoh, it&#39;s worse than I thought.&quot; Rei said to herself. &quot;What were 
they doing?&quot; she asked her grandpa.
	&quot;They were over in the wooded area and ChibiUsa had her shirt off&quot; 
grandpa gulped, &quot;and Hotaru was touching ChibiUsa&#39;s breasts. Beautiful 
breasts I must say . . . very perky. . .&quot; Rei&#39;s grandpa trailed off.
	Laughter came from behind and Rei turned around to see all of the 
scouts standing right behind her. They had obviously heard the 
conversation between Rei and her grandpa. Rei blushed and then laughed 
along with the rest of them.
	&quot;Oh grandpa, what are we gonna do with you. We&#39;d have to lock you 
in a cage to keep you from hurting yourself every time you see a girl 
walk by.&quot; Rei teased.
	Rei&#39;s grandpa just sat on the ground wide eyed and mumbling to 
himself. He obviously hadn&#39;t heard a word Rei had just said. 
	All of the scouts went inside the temple and took their seats. 
King Endymion arrived just as everyone was getting settled.
	&quot;So what&#39;s this news I&#39;ve been hearing about all week?&quot; King 
Endymion asked cheerfully as he walked through the door.
	ChibiUsa ran up and gave her father a big hug, &quot;I&#39;m so happy 
you&#39;re here daddy!&quot;
	King Endymion hugged his daughter back, &quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here too 
Small Lady. I haven&#39;t seen you in a while. How&#39;s your mother?&quot;
	Just as King Endymion finished his sentence, Usagi (Neo Queen 
Serenity) walked into the room from Rei&#39;s chamber. 
	&quot;Hello Mamo-chan, we were hoping you could make it. I know how 
busy you&#39;ve been lately.&quot; Usagi said.
	&quot;Now that everyone is here, why don&#39;t we get started.&quot; Hotaru 
said.
	Everyone looked toward ChibiUsa and Hotaru, anxious to hear the 
news.
	ChibiUsa cleared her throat and started talking,&quot;As some of you 
already know, Hotaru and I are engaged to be married!&quot; Hotaru said 
excitedly and then continued, &quot;There was a question of how I would have 
an heir if I married a female, so Hotaru and I talked it out for a good 
while and finally came up with an idea. We have talked with Ami-chan and 
she told us of a process she knows of to where she can artificially 
combine Hotaru and I&#39;s genes and then implant the fertilized egg in my 
womb.&quot;
	Everyone was in awe as ChibiUsa spoke. There was a mixture of 
emotion throughout the room, uncertainty, surprise, and joy.
	&quot;We have decided that we would like to have twins however, so Ami-
chan is going to fertilize two eggs, one of mine, and one of ChibiUsa&#39;s 
with the other&#39;s genes. ChibiUsa&#39;s going to carry both babies however. 
We are very excited to get everything started. We&#39;re going to need a lot 
of help with the wedding plans.&quot; Hotaru added
	ChibiUsa looked at Hotaru and said excitedly, &quot;I was hoping you 
could make the food!&quot;
	&quot;Of course.&quot; Makoto said sweatdropping. &quot;I should have guessed you 
would want food.&quot;
	The other scouts burst into laughter.
	&quot;I wanna make the invitations!&quot; shouted Minako.
	&quot;That would be nice, we&#39;ll need a lot of those!&quot; ChibiUsa answered.
	&quot;I&#39;ll help Minako with the invites!&quot; Ami added. &quot;We can use my 
computer software to create a design and then print the invitations. My 
printer will print 5000 sheets of paper before running out of ink!&quot;
	&quot;Sounds great! So who wants to help us design our wedding gowns?&quot; 
Hotaru looked over at Makoto.
	&quot;How do I get the feeling that I&#39;m going to get stuck with the job 
whether I want it or not?&quot; Makoto asked sweatdropping.
	&quot;I knew you would do it!&quot; ChibiUsa shouted as she threw her arms 
around the tall girl.
	Makoto sweatdropped even more. &quot;Yeah, yeah.&quot;
	Hotaru and ChibiUsa&#39;s eyes met smiling. They both seemed to be 
saying, &quot;I love you&quot; silently.
	&quot;So what should I do?&quot; Rei asked feeling left out.
	&quot;Well, why don&#39;t you supply the candles for the ceremony? We&#39;re 
going to need some really neat ones.&quot; Hotaru said.
	Rei brightened up, &quot;Yeah, that sounds like a great idea, I can 
make my traditional home-made wedding candles!&quot;
	&quot;Since both of us are girls, we&#39;ll both be brides. So we figured 
we&#39;ll need two maids of honor, twelve brides maids and two flower 
girls.&quot; ChibiUsa said
	&quot;We think the wisest and older women in the group should be the 
maids of honor. So we&#39;re going to choose Setsuna since she&#39;s the oldest 
of the scouts, and Luna since she&#39;s the wisest and one of the oldest 
women in the group. So Luna, you&#39;ll have to transform into a human for 
the wedding.&quot; ChibiUsa said anxiously.
	Luna looked back at ChibiUsa lovingly,&quot;I&#39;m glad to know that I&#39;m 
loved and appreciated.&quot; Luna said softly. &quot;I&#39;d be glad to be your maid 
of honor.&quot;
	Setsuna looked pleased as well and agreed with Luna that it would 
be an honor.
	&quot;Then it&#39;s settled, you&#39;ll be my maid of honor Setsuna, and Luna 
will be ChibiUsa&#39;s&quot; Hotaru stated.
	&quot;Artemis, you&#39;ll be the ring bearer.&quot; ChibiUsa added
	Artemis grinned and said,&quot;I can handle that. I suppose you&#39;ll want 
me to be a human huh?&quot;
	&quot;Yes, it would make a lot more sense that way, don&#39;t you think?&quot; 
Luna answered.
	&quot;Now for the brides maids&quot; Hotaru said, &quot;Haruka, Michiru, Cere 
Cere,Rei,Makoto, and Palla-Palla will be my brides maids.&quot; 
	&quot;Diana, Minako, Ami, Jun-Jun, Ves-Ves, and Mamoko will be my 
brides maids.&quot; ChibiUsa added. &quot;And of course, Mom and Dad will be there 
to lead us down the aisle.&quot; 
	&quot;I&#39;m so happy for you Small Lady.&quot; King Endymion said as he hugged 
his daughter tightly. &quot;You take good care of my daughter Hotaru.&quot; he 
smiled at Hotaru.
	&quot;Oh I will.&quot; Hotaru nodded.
	&quot;What about your flower girls Small Lady?&quot; Neo Queen Serenity 
asked her daughter.
	&quot;Oh yes, well I was going to have Kusagi and her friend Mishu be 
the flower girls. What do you think?&quot; ChibiUsa asked her mother.
	&quot;I&#39;m sure they&#39;d be more than happy to be flower girls&quot; the queen 
smiled.
	&quot;Good, then now that everything is settled, how bout we all eat?&quot; 
ChibiUsa asked excitedly.
	Everyone sweatdropped.
	&quot;I suppose I&#39;ll serve lunch now.&quot; Makoto said standing up and 
walking toward the kitchen.
	ChibiUsa and Neo Queen Serenity&#39;s stomachs growled simultaneously 
and everyone burst out laughing.
	&quot;They haven&#39;t changed a bit!&quot; Luna said sweatdropping.


	&quot;I know you love her, but are you sure this is going to work?&quot; Neo 
Queen Serenity asked her daughter. The wind rustled the queen&#39;s elegant 
dress as she stood with her child on the balcony.
	&quot;Mom, of course I&#39;m sure. Like you said, I love her,&quot; ChibiUsa 
said emphatically. 
	&quot;But you&#39;re a princess. You&#39;re expected to marry someone of royal 
birth,&quot; Serenity continued.
	&quot;Hotaru is. She was the princess of Saturn,&quot; ChibiUsa smiled at 
the thought of the dark haired girl.
	&quot;You and Hotaru are going to have daughters that are cloned from 
both of you.&quot;
 	&quot;Yes. I know I have to have an heir. And I want it to be ours. 
Hotaru and I are really having our own daughters. I love her and she 
loves me. This is like a way of showing it. It feels good to know 
they&#39;ll be a little bit of both of us,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	Serenity thought about it for a moment. &quot;That&#39;s true. And she&#39;s a 
very responsible girl. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll both handle the things well when 
I pass down the crown. But are you sure the two of you can handle twins? 
That&#39;s going to be a lot of work for both of you.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m sure. We talked about it for a long time. We want to have 
twins. I know it will be a lot of work, but I know Hotaru will be able 
to raise them. Just like how you raised me.&quot; ChibiUsa turned to look at 
her mother. 
	&quot;But you&#39;re going through with all this so quickly. You&#39;re getting 
married and you&#39;re already getting ready to have children,&quot; Serenity 
said helplessly.
	&quot;Mom, don&#39;t worry. Hotaru and I will have an heir. And we love 
each other.&quot; ChibiUsa stressed the point. &quot;That&#39;s all that matters, 
right?&quot;
	The Queen nodded. &quot;Yes. Yes, that is all that matters. Small Lady, 
I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve found someone you love so much. I&#39;m just worried. My 
little girl&#39;s getting married. You&#39;re going to have a baby. It feels 
like you&#39;re growing up so fast.&quot;
	&quot;Mom...&quot; ChibiUsa said softly. She hugged her mother. &quot;Is that it? 
You&#39;re worried about me? I&#39;ll be fine. As long as I&#39;ve got Hotaru by my 
side, I&#39;ll be fine. You&#39;ve taught me so much. The most important thing 
I&#39;ve learned from you has to be to follow your heart. And I know where 
that leads me. I&#39;ll be fine. And I&#39;ll always be you&#39;re little girl.&quot;
	Serenity hugged her daughter back tightly. &quot;Small Lady, I&#39;m happy 
for you,&quot; she said as she held back some warm tears. The moisture 
gathered on the tips of her eyelashes as she blinked them away. Her 
little girl had grown up into a beautiful woman before her eyes and she 
hadn&#39;t noticed. She&#39;d thought that ChibiUsa would wait when she&#39;d told 
her she needed to have an heir, but she wasn&#39;t a child anymore. She&#39;d 
moved on and was now ready to start a family of her own. 
	&quot;Thanks, mom. That means a lot to me.&quot; ChibiUsa smiled and closed 
her eyes. She remembered how her mother had always been there for her 
when she needed help. She knew that she&#39;d still be there, no matter what 
happened. 

	&quot;What did you want to talk about, Onii-chan?&quot; Kousagi asked. She 
smiled politely at her sister&#39;s girlfriend. The two were both nice to 
hang around with. She ate some more of her ice cream, enjoying the sweet 
taste. She noticed that ChibiUsa still hadn&#39;t touched hers. As usual, 
Hotaru hadn&#39;t ordered much. She took another sip of the soda she&#39;d 
bought.
	ChibiUsa thought for a moment, taking a taste of her melting ice 
cream. She made a face before eating some more. &quot;You know how Hotaru-
chan and I have been going out for a long time now, right?&quot; she started 
nervously. 
	Kousagi nodded. &quot;Yeah. It keeps you busy. You two are always going 
out on dates or disappearing off together.&quot;
	ChibiUsa turned to Hotaru before continuing. The raven haired girl 
smiled reassuringly. &quot;Hotaru means a lot to me. I love her more than 
anything.&quot;
	Turning to Hotaru, Kousagi grinned. &quot;You really are good for my 
sister.&quot;
	A smile lit up Hotaru&#39;s face as she took ChibiUsa&#39;s free hand in 
her own. &quot;Thank you.&quot;
	&quot;She&#39;s always really happy when you&#39;re around. And when you&#39;re not 
around, she&#39;s always talking about you,&quot; the younger girl said.
	&quot;Kousagi...&quot; ChibiUsa blushed. Kousagi just giggled. Hotaru smiled 
to herself. She loved these family moments. She learned to cherish them 
when she&#39;d grown up with Setsuna, Haruka, and Michiru because they&#39;d 
come few and far between when she&#39;d been living alone with her father. 
That lonely life had only been interrupted by ChibiUsa&#39;s appearance into 
her world. 
&quot;I have something important to tell you,&quot; ChibiUsa said after a 
minute.
	Kousagi looked at the pink haired girl, her eyes bright with 
curiosity. &quot;What is it?&quot; she asked.
	ChibiUsa took a deep breath. She&#39;d already told some of her 
closest friends and her mother. There weren&#39;t too many people she had to 
tell. This was her sister, she&#39;d understand. Kousagi already knew 
ChibiUsa was in love with Hotaru. This was just the next step in that. 
&quot;Hotaru and I are getting married.&quot;
	The younger girl nearly fell, stumbling forward after what she&#39;d 
heard. Her ice cream dropped to the concrete. &quot;You&#39;re getting married?&quot; 
She looked at the two lovers holding hands next to her. 
	Hotaru nodded. &quot;We just got engaged. We should be getting married 
very soon.&quot; The dark haired girl looked happier than Kousagi had ever 
seen her.
	&quot;But.. but you can&#39;t get married!&quot; Kousagi protested, emotions 
bubbling over within her. She thought frantically. &quot;I thought mom said 
you needed an heir.&quot;
	&quot;I do, but Hotaru and I already have that set up. Thanks to Ami 
and her help with some cloning, I&#39;ll be pregnant with twins after Hotaru 
and I get married,&quot; ChibiUsa said happily.
	Tears welled up in the younger girl&#39;s eyes. &quot;But you can&#39;t get 
married.&quot;
	&quot;Kousagi-chan, what&#39;s wrong? Why not?&quot; ChibiUsa asked worriedly. 
Her sister had sounded hurt just now.
	&quot;I don&#39;t want you to move out,&quot; Kousagi sniffled. &quot;I&#39;d miss you 
too much.&quot; She wiped at her tears.
	&quot;Oh, Kousagi.&quot; ChibiUsa took a step forward and hugged her little 
sister. &quot;Its alright.&quot;
	&quot;You won&#39;t be around anymore. Before, even if you were spending 
the night at Hotaru&#39;s, I knew Onii-chan would be back. Now you&#39;ll be 
living with her,&quot; Kousagi said sadly. &quot;I don&#39;t want you to go.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;ll still see you a lot. I&#39;ll visit all the time. You can&#39;t get 
rid of me that easy. You and mom will see plenty of me. Hotaru and I 
will still live in the palace,&quot; ChibiUsa said soothingly. She kneeled by 
the younger girl and wiped a tear away from her cheek.
	&quot;Really?&quot; Kousagi said shakily.
	&quot;Really. Tell you what, you can come visit us whenever you want.&quot; 
ChibiUsa held her sister at arms length and smiled gently at her. 
Kousagi returned the smile weakly.
	Hotaru put her hand on the younger girl&#39;s shoulder. &quot;I&#39;m sorry, 
Kousagi. I&#39;m not trying to steal your sister. I just love her so much. I 
want to be with her. But we&#39;d be happy if you&#39;d visit us a lot.&quot;
	Kousagi slowly nodded. &quot;I&#39;d like that,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I&#39;d 
like that a lot.&quot;

	As the three girls walked back to the palace, Hotaru sighed. &#39;It 
looks like Odango-chan&#39;s family wasn&#39;t quite ready to give her up yet. 
All in all, it seems to be going pretty well, otherwise. We&#39;re finally 
getting married.&#39; The raven haired girl smiled to herself. &#39;Soon we&#39;ll 
be married.&#39;
