<h1>Absence (part 14 of 60)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kirika.html">Kirika</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/absence-ch13.html">Back to Part 13</a><pre>Rei supported her head in one hand as she gazed out of the train window, 
absently watching the scenery fly by. She let out a deep sigh. She was 
on her way back to Tokyo, back to her old life... back to *her*. But 
there had never been any choice in the matter; Setsuna had said Usagi 
needed Rei and that had been enough to make the Fire Senshi return to 
her former home.

By the time Khairephon had been defeated, the glowing light of a rising 
sun shone on the horizon. Rei wearily set out, with Tsubasa and Setsuna, 
for Sanjuro&#39;s apartment to retrieve the miko&#146;s things. She had been 
anxious to leave Yokohama immediately despite her injuries and obvious 
exhaustion. Setsuna, however, had stated that there would be plenty time 
and had insisted that the Fire Senshi come to her hotel room and stay 
until she was rested. Rei had reluctantly conceded; she had been utterly 
drained from her long night of fighting.

Shortly after arriving at Sanjuro&#146;s apartment, Tsubasa had left with his 
luggage to return to his own apartment. Since the youma threat had ended 
in the city, he had felt secure in the fact that it would be safe to do 
so. Before he left, Setsuna had informed him of which train station Rei 
and herself would be leaving from and what time the train departed. Rei 
wondered why the Senshi of Time had bothered. Usagi was in danger and 
the miko would go to her; but it changed nothing. Rei would eventually 
have to return to Yokohama alone and resume her solitary life there. Rei 
Hino and Sailor Mars were still dead. But when her opinions had been 
voiced, Setsuna had merely given Rei a look that told her it would be 
best if she said goodbye.

Setsuna had then taken the raven-haired girl to her hotel room; Rei 
figured a person would have to be able to foresee the future to actually 
get one in Yokohama. The Guardian of Time had helped Rei treat her 
wounds, never asking about the multitude of other bandages that covered 
the miko&#146;s body, and then had told her to sleep. But Rei had wanted 
answers to questions like who, or what, was endangering Usagi and 
exactly what were Tokyo&#39;s state of affairs. Setsuna had refused to 
indulge her, silently demanding compliance by simply pointing to the 
bed.

It was late into the afternoon by the time Rei had awoken from her long 
sleep. Already packed, the two Sailor Senshi had then departed for the 
train station to head back to Tokyo. When they had gotten there, Tsubasa 
was waiting for them on the station platform with a flat box carried 
under one arm. He had presented it to the Senshi of Fire, explaining to 
her that since she didn&#39;t seem to have one, he had gone out and bought 
one for her. Anxious to leave Yokohama, Rei had accepted the present 
with a simple goodbye. Tsubasa had assured the Fire Senshi that he would 
check up on Sanjuro and wanted her to say hi to Usagi for him. Rei had 
shot him a cold expression, and then promptly boarded the train to join 
Setsuna. The Senshi of Time had already boarded and was waiting 
patiently for her. Rei had never told Tsubasa her real name.

Rei let out another sigh, her breath clouding the window. She was scared 
to return to Tokyo, to her friends, and to her family. She had every 
intention to remain hidden from them if she could, helping her fellow 
Sailors from the shadows and never revealing her true identity to any of 
them. She was afraid, too, that once she saw Usagi all of her will to 
leave Tokyo again would desert her completely; even after all of the 
danger to the blonde had been dealt with. It had taken everything Rei 
had to leave the first time. To do it a second... the miko didn&#39;t know 
if she possessed that level of determination.

Rei squirmed restlessly in her seat. The calling sensation she had first 
felt during the fight with Khairephon was still there inside her and 
hadn&#39;t abandoned her since it had appeared. While the Senshi of Fire 
wondered what it was, she decided not to dwell on it; there were other 
more important matters right now to be concerned about. Rei turned her 
head towards Setsuna who sat in the seat next to her as calm and as 
peaceful as ever.

&quot;Will you tell me why I&#39;m heading back to Tokyo now?&quot; the raven-haired 
girl asked, slightly frustrated with the Outer Senshi&#146;s lack of 
forthcoming information.

&quot;You know why. You are needed,&quot; Setsuna replied simply, never taking her 
eyes off the book she was reading.

Rei ground her teeth, controlling her rising annoyance. &quot;I *know* I&#39;m 
needed! But I want details. How much danger is Usagi in? What type of 
enemies are we facing? How many? What is happening to Tokyo?&quot;

Setsuna took her time marking the spot in her book and closing it, 
irritating Rei to no end. She then turned her timeless crimson coloured 
eyes towards the girl.

&quot;You already know what kind of enemies they are. The creature you fought 
last night in the factory is one of four. The other three are in Tokyo, 
but only one has made herself known at this time,&quot; Setsuna revealed.

Rei turned her head away from the Senshi of Time, looking at the back of 
the seat in front of her. Three others. There were three other creatures 
with the kind of power that Khairephon had running around in Tokyo. Rei 
didn&#146;t want to even imagine what kind of damage they could do to the 
city... or to its populace. She narrowed her eyes and clenched one hand 
into a fist. No wonder Setsuna had come for her. The Sailor Senshi would 
need all the help they could get tackling those... demons.

&quot;But that is not the reason I contacted you,&quot; Setsuna continued, as if 
reading Rei&#146;s thoughts.

Rei turned sharply back towards Setsuna, frowning in confusion. What 
could be more important than destroying Khairephon&#39;s three evil cohorts?

&quot;I told you once before that there are many possible futures, many 
threads in time....&quot; Setsuna paused for a moment, looking away from Rei 
as though contemplating something. After a second the Guardian of Time 
apparently reached a decision and returned her gaze to the girl. &quot;But 
all of the futures I have seen so far seem to end up at the same point.&quot; 
Setsuna let out a small sigh, staring deeply into the miko&#146;s lavender 
eyes.

Setsuna&#39;s eyes shone with the light of astute wisdom that could only 
come from over a millennia of life. It made Rei uncomfortable; it was as 
though the woman was looking into her very soul.

&quot;There will be a moment; a defining moment in the near future. I don&#39;t 
know exactly when it will occur, but it will soon.&quot; the Senshi of Time 
concluded.

Rei swallowed hard at the news. &quot;It has to do with Usagi, doesn&#146;t 
it....&quot; she whispered, instinctively knowing it to be true.

Setsuna nodded gravely. &quot;Yes, it has to do with the princess... her 
life....&quot; she trailed off, causing the Senshi of Fire&#146;s stomach to start 
churning in fear.

Rei looked away and gripped the armrests of her seat tightly, her 
knuckles white. &quot;And you don&#39;t know when?&quot; she asked quietly.

Setsuna shook her head slightly. &quot;Not precisely, only that it will 
happen in the near future. I&#39;m having trouble seeing past the moment, 
also. The threads beyond it are clouded; hidden from my view....&quot; the 
green-haired woman paused and her brow ceased faintly for the briefest 
of instants before she continued, &quot;but I do know that in some of the 
futures I have seen you are there--&quot;

&quot;--And that&#39;s why you came to Yokohama for me,&quot; Rei finished for the 
Senshi of Time. She was quiet for a moment. &quot;I&#39;m glad you did,&quot; she then 
said softly.

Rei returned her gaze to Setsuna, looking into her eyes. She could tell 
that there was more the Guardian of Time knew, but didn&#39;t press her. All 
Rei needed to know was that Usagi was in life threatening danger and she 
would protect her from it. When Death came for her princess; Rei would 
meet its blow with her own.

Rei leaned back in her seat, closing her eyes and wiping off the nervous 
sweat from her palms onto her pant legs.

&quot;Have you told any of the others about this?&quot; she inquired after a 
moment.

Rei heard Setsuna resettle in the seat beside her. &quot;No. I didn&#39;t want to 
interfere with the timeline. The only reason I contacted you was because 
you asked it of me back at your funeral,&quot; the woman replied.

Rei smiled without humour, her eyes still closed. &quot;And this isn&#39;t a 
necessary time to &#39;interfere&#39; with the timeline?&quot; she asked acidly.

Setsuna didn&#39;t answer.

******

While the train journey from Yokohama to Tokyo only took half an hour, 
it was dark by the time Setsuna and Rei arrived in the capitol city. 
They had to take a second train to get to Minato-ku, and once there, 
Setsuna asked Rei if she would like to stay overnight at the mansion she 
shared with the other Outer Senshi.

Rei declined. She didn&#39;t want her presence in Tokyo known to anybody 
else. Haruka, Michiru and Hotaru would surely see her if she stayed with 
Setsuna. As Rei bid Setsuna goodbye, the Guardian of Time gazed into her 
eyes with another soul-searching look resembling the one she&#39;d given 
back on the train. Rei stared back, somehow unable to turn away.

&quot;Good luck,&quot; Setsuna finally said in a soft voice, breaking her gaze 
with the miko, then turned and walked off into the night.

Rei watched her go. Setsuna was always sort of strange and mysterious. 
Rei shrugged her shoulders dismissively and forgot about the Senshi of 
Time. She had to find a place to spend the night. After considering her 
options for a few seconds, the Fire Senshi decided to go back to the 
cheap roach motel she had stayed at previously when waiting for her 
funeral to take place.

After Rei checked into the motel, she went to her room to pass the time; 
it was still early evening and she doubted if the Sailor Senshi would be 
active at the moment. The Fire Senshi needed time to determine how 
exactly she would go about protecting Usagi without being noticed, 
anyway.

Rei dropped her bag and Tsubasa&#39;s box onto the floor, and then flopped 
backwards onto the bed with her hands clasped behind her head. Rei 
stared blankly at the ceiling, one finger tapping on a hand behind her 
head. Now that she was in Tokyo she felt very fidgety for some reason. 
She tried to ignore the nagging voice in her mind that told her to go 
see Usagi. Rei knew she would have to see the girl eventually, but she 
was afraid that one look at her beautiful princess would cause her to 
crack and never leave her love&#146;s side again.

Rei&#146;s eyes darted around the room, trying to find something to occupy 
herself with. Her gaze rested on Tsubasa&#39;s box on the floor. Maybe 
looking at what Tsubasa had given her would engage her mind for a 
while... at least long enough for her to forget any ideas about seeing 
Usagi. It was probably just something lame or useless like flowers 
however, Rei thought rather ungratefully.

She sat up on the bed and reached over to pick up the flat cardboard box 
from the floor, then pulled the top off. Inside was a long black coat 
similar to the one she had worn when she had transformed into Sailor 
Mars back in Yokohama. Tsubasa; that idiot. Why would she need this? 
Although, it could come in handy as a disguise....

Rei laid the coat on the bed and carelessly tossed the empty box back 
onto the floor. She sat on the edge of the bed and idly kicked her legs. 
She was still restless. Despite how small it was, the pulling sensation 
inside of her was still there and growing hard to ignore.

Rei cursed and got to her feet. Picking up the new coat, she slipped it 
on. It seemed that Tsubasa had guessed her size correctly; the black 
coat fit her perfectly. Maybe she could walk by Usagi&#146;s house... just to 
check on her, of course, nothing more. Yes, that was a good idea. What 
if the blonde girl was in trouble at this very minute? It *was* a 
possibility. With that flimsy excuse in mind, the Fire Senshi flicked up 
the collar of her coat and left the motel room.

******

As Rei walked to Usagi&#39;s house, she contemplated visiting her own grave. 
After all, she had never seen the actual gravestone. The miko wondered 
what was written on it. Lost in thought, Rei continued straight on ahead 
instead of turning down Usagi&#39;s street. Rei stopped when she realised 
what she had done; she had followed the call inside of her. The Senshi 
of Fire frowned in irritation. The pulling was starting to annoy her. 
She let out a sigh and decided to just give in to instinct; she would 
let whatever the feeling was inside of her choose her path.

As Rei continued walking, she realised that she was being led to the 
park. Rei wondered what it was she was feeling. The sensation was barely 
there, but she could still tell in which direction it was drawing her 
towards. When she approached the park, the miko could hear shouting. Her 
initial thought was that it was a little late to be playing games. But 
when strange, loud, insect-like chirps were added to the shouts, the 
Senshi of Fire quickly ran the rest of the way to the park.

Rei moved from tree to tree, her black coat aiding in her stealthy 
approach to the source of the noises. She was certain it was a battle 
between the Sailor Senshi and some youma, but she had to be totally 
sure. Once Rei had finally reached the origin of the shouts, she leaned 
out from behind a tall tree trunk and took a cautious peek. There were 
four senshi fighting two youma. Rei saw that Sailor Jupiter, Sailor 
Mercury and Sailor Uranus were there. And Sailor Moon.

Rei gasped and gazed longingly at her princess. This must be what a 
person dying of thirst felt like when finding a crystal clear oasis in 
front of them. As Rei took in the divine vision that was Sailor Moon, 
the heart she had thought dead stirred in her chest once more after what 
seemed an eternity. She already felt her resolve to keep hidden from the 
girl weakening. Rei swallowed the lump that was forming in her throat 
and forced back the tears that were starting to come to her eyes. No. 
She would not let this happen again. Rei had sworn after breaking down 
back in Yokohama that she would shed no more tears over a hopeless love.

Rei frowned a little as she looked at Sailor Moon. There was a slight 
tightness around her princess&#146;s eyes, eyes that seemed dull. The 
princess&#39;s hair had lost some of its usual sheen, too. Rei&#146;s eyes moved 
to the other senshi and wondered where the rest of them were. And where 
*he* was as well. The Fire Senshi balled her fists in anger. Tuxedo 
Kamen should have been here defending Sailor Moon!

Rei moved completely behind the tree and climbed nimbly up into its 
branches to give herself a better vantage of the battle. Someone had to 
protect her princess... and that was why *she* was here. Using the 
tree&#146;s thick foliage as cover, Rei whispered the words to change her 
into her alter ego and quietly transformed.

Transformation complete, Sailor Mars felt the familiar feeling of a long 
coat on her; but there was something... different. She felt the weight 
of the hat that had appeared that first time before in Yokohama and her 
hair piled underneath it. The crimson veil still covered her face as 
always. Mars looked down at herself and her eyes widened. She was 
wearing her Sailor Senshi fuku under her coat. Sailor Mars blinked down 
at it, wondering why it had come back. Perhaps all of the thoughts 
regarding Sailor Moon--and possibly Tuxedo Kamen, also--had affected her 
transformation. Or maybe it was affected by Mars&#39; will to protect her 
princess as one of her personal bodyguards.

From her high perch in the tree, Sailor Mars had to strain her eyes to 
observe the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e through the leaves. Both youma the Sailors were 
fighting looked vaguely humanoid and distinctly female. One was a giant 
half-woman half-scorpion abomination. The lower part of its body was 
that of a scorpion having six legs and a large tail capped with a wicked 
stinger. The top part of its body resembled a woman&#39;s, except that its 
hands had been replaced with large chitinous pincers that snapped 
menacingly. The other youma was similar to its partner, except that it 
was half-spider and half-woman. It walked on eight hairy legs and 
possessed two web shooters that sprouted from human-looking forearms.

&quot;WORLD SHAKING!&quot;

Sailor Mars watched as an orange energy ball smashed into the scorpion 
youma and threw the creature onto its back.

The spider youma shot out strands of web from its arms at Sailor Uranus 
and Sailor Mercury, forcing both senshi to dodge out of the way. One of 
the silk threads, however, managed to wrap around Mercury&#39;s ankles, 
causing the youma emit an insect-like chitter. Mars suspected that the 
sound was its equivalent of laughter. The giant half-spider fired 
another web strand at the blue-haired genius&#146; prone body effectively 
tying her arms up. Sailor Jupiter glanced at Sailor Mercury and glared 
at the youma responsible for the girl&#146;s predicament with hatred.

&quot;SPARKLING WIDE PRESSURE!&quot;

Sailor Jupiter hurled a ball of electricity at the spider youma. In a 
split second the creature spun a solid web shield before it, letting the 
large oval shape absorb the electrical blast. Jupiter let out a growl of 
frustration.

Meanwhile, the scorpion youma had used its clawed forearms to flip 
itself back onto its legs and now snapped its pincers at Sailor Moon, 
trying to grab her. The blonde odango atama hastily turned and ran away, 
then leapt to her left as the half-scorpion&#39;s tail pierced the ground 
where she had once stood, clumps of dirt flying upwards. Sailor Mars 
breathed a sigh of relief at the sight of her princess&#146;s narrow escape.

&quot;SPACE SWORD BLASTER!&quot;

Sailor Uranus fired out a blinding white light from her scimitar, which 
crashed into the spider youma&#39;s web shield, turning it instantly to 
dust. The spider youma launched a ball of silk threads at Uranus in 
retaliation. The projectile splattered onto the Senshi of Air, rapidly 
encasing her within its strong gluey substance. The force of the hit was 
enough to knock Uranus to the ground. The shorthaired blonde cursed and 
flexed her arms in an effort to snap the strands with sheer strength.

In the meantime, the scorpion youma seeing easy prey, had scuttled over 
to Sailor Mercury as the girl wiggled on the ground endeavouring to free 
herself of the sticky threads that surrounded her appendages.

&quot;Leave her alone, you ugly bug!&quot; yelled Sailor Jupiter, running in front 
of the prone Sailor Mercury to intercept the youma.

&quot;No, look out!!&quot; Mercury warned in a desperate shout.

Sailor Jupiter cried out in surprise as she was caught off guard by the 
spider youma, taking a web blast to the face. She pulled frantically at 
the webbing that covered her mouth and nose, but only succeeded in 
getting her hands stuck, too. Sailor Jupiter stumbled backwards and 
tripped over Sailor Mercury as she fervently tore at the web as best she 
could with her imprisoned hands before she asphyxiated.

The scorpion youma chittered like the spider youma had in amusement and 
raised its tail in preparation to strike a deadly blow. A clear drop of 
fluid appeared at the end of its sharp stinger; it didn&#146;t take a genius 
to know what the liquid contained. Sailor Mars watched anxiously on as a 
look of utter horror came over Sailor Moon&#39;s face.

&quot;Nooo! Jupiter! Mercury!&quot; screamed Sailor Moon, who seemed close to 
hysterics.

&quot;MOON TIARA ACTION!&quot;

Sailor Moon&#39;s tiara flew at the youma, slicing through the tip of its 
tail. The stinger fell to the grass in a spray of putrid green while 
similarly coloured blood splattered out like a fountain from the 
amputated end of the creature&#146;s tail. The scorpion youma roared in agony 
and whirled around to face Sailor Moon, skittering along the ground on 
six legs directly for her.

Sailor Mars tensed as the sneaky spider youma shot strands of silk 
around Sailor Moon&#39;s legs, tripping her over onto the grass. Mars heard 
a shout of triumph as Uranus tore apart the web ball that had enclosed 
her.

&quot;Sailor Moon!&quot; Uranus yelled as she saw the scorpion youma bearing down 
on Mars&#39; vulnerable princess.

&quot;WORLD SHA-- umph!&quot;

The spider youma had deftly fired a sticky silk glob over Sailor Uranus&#39; 
mouth, silencing her attack.

Meanwhile, its scorpion companion picked the helpless Sailor Moon up by 
one of her arms with a pincer. It then raised and opened its other 
pincer, ready to impale the blonde girl on its sharp twin pointed ends.

Sailor Mars cursed loudly and knew she had to act. She couldn&#39;t just sit 
idly by and watch her princess be in danger like this. Mars&#39; powers of 
fire would identify her; but she never hesitated for a second.

&quot;MARS FLAME SNIPER!&quot;

An arrow of flame burst out from the tree branches, setting some of the 
foliage alight. The blazing projectile ripped into the giant insect&#39;s 
shoulder and exploded, tearing the limb clean off and cauterising the 
wound instantly while the creature howled in torment. Unable to use her 
feet, Sailor Moon dropped heavily to the ground with the youma&#39;s pincer 
still attached to her arm.

All of the Sailors&#146; heads turned at the same time to look up into the 
tree where the bolt of fire originated from; including Jupiter who had 
succeeded in pulling the silk threads from her face.

Sailor Mars leapt boldly out of the tree and into the air with her arms 
stretched out behind her, head tilted back and eyes closed. Her long 
coat slipped off of her shoulders to expose her Sailor Senshi fuku, 
while her black hat fell backwards to loose her long hair, which spilled 
luxuriously down her back. The veil flew from her face into the air, 
uncovering her beautiful features. The Senshi of Fire landed in a 
crouch, her coat, hat, and veil fluttering to the ground around her. 
Sailor Mars stood and opened her lavender eyes to reveal herself in all 
her glory.

There was collective gasp as all of the other senshi realised who was 
standing before them. Mars said nothing and turned sharply to face the 
spider youma.

The spider youma made a clicking noise and shot two web balls at her in 
response. Obviously it was unaware of just who it was dealing with.

&quot;FIRE SOUL BIRD!&quot;

The phoenix shrieked at the spider youma, burning the web balls to ash 
and continuing on to smash into it. The fire bird set the creature&#39;s 
furry lower insect body aflame. The other Sailor Senshi, bar one, 
recovered at the sound of the screeching youma as it burned alive and 
quickly took the initiative.

&quot;SPACE SWORD BLASTER!&quot;

A white beam tore through the spider youma-turned-inferno, 
disintegrating its human-like upper body.

Sailor Mercury finally squirmed out of her web bindings and stood up, 
the majority of the silky threads still hanging from her fuku.

&quot;SHINE AQUA ILLUSION!&quot;

A geyser jetted from Mercury&#39;s hands and collided heavily with the 
scorpion youma, freezing it where it stood still screaming in pain from 
Sailor Mars&#39; maiming attack.

&quot;SUPREME THUNDER DRAGON!&quot;

A dragon made out entirely of electricity came roaring at the frozen 
youma and engulfed the petrified creature completely in its crackling 
maw. As the dragon gorged itself, it charged the monster&#39;s body with an 
electrical energy that was heightened by the frozen water encasing it. 
The ice shattered and the youma collapsed to the ground, its internal 
organs cooked and its outsides oddly chilled. Upon the youma&#39;s deaths, 
their remains began to melt away into the ground.

With the enemy dealt with, all of the Sailors&#146; turned wide disbelieving 
eyes onto the Fire Senshi. But Mars was only interested in one Sailor.

Sailor Moon still sat where she had landed, the decaying web and arm 
from the two youma still attached to her. She looked up at Sailor Mars, 
not blinking.

Sailor Mars stared mutely back at her princess. She had thought about 
what she would say if it were to come to this, but now all words fled 
her. So Mars simply stared, her mouth slightly open.

As Sailor Moon got slowly to her feet the decomposed web threads around 
her legs pulled apart easily with the movement and the youma&#39;s pincer 
fell to the ground. She walked slowly over to Sailor Mars with unsure 
steps, hands raised a little in front of her.

Mars looked at Sailor Moon a little warily, not sure what her princess 
would do. Would she slap her? Yell at her for hiding? But then the 
raven-haired girl noticed tears in the odango atama&#39;s eyes, twinkling in 
the moonlight.

Sailor Moon fell to her knees in front of Sailor Mars and wrapped her 
arms tightly around the bodyguard&#39;s waist, the side of her face pressed 
against the Fire Senshi&#146;s stomach. And then she cried. The tears kept 
pouring from Sailor Moon as the stress of loss and battle came out all 
at once.

Sailor Mars tilted her head back and shut her eyes as her own tears 
started to squeeze out from behind her eyelids, leaving cold wet trails 
down her cheeks. She lifted her hands to the top of her gorgeous 
princess&#39;s head and ran her fingers through the silky blonde hair. All 
of Sailor Mars&#39; will to leave again caved in; the miko felt alive once 
more. It was as if her once cold and hardened heart had started beating 
again, as if the eternal fire of love that always burned for Sailor Moon 
inside her had become an unstoppable inferno. How completely stupid she 
had been to leave the darling angel before her.

Never. Never again would she. Sailor Mars would never, ever abandon her 
princess&#39;s side again. How much damage had she done to this beautiful 
creature because of her actions? These tears were all her fault. Mars 
had never felt such guilt and relief in all of her life. She and Sailor 
Moon were reunited at last.

Sailor Mars heard Sailor Moon mumbling her name over and over again 
through sobs. Rei. That was her name and Sailor Mars was who she was. 
She would always be Rei Hino and Sailor Mars, defending her princess to 
the very last.

Sailor Mars opened her wet eyes and looked at the full moon that shone 
above them. Rei Hino was reborn here today. She was reborn to protect 
her princess... the true love of her immortal life and her *only* love 
of her immortal life....

Author&#39;s ramblings:

I decided to let Rei and Usagi meet up. Having Rei being a mysterious 
Tuxedo Kamen-style character wouldn&#39;t work out. Besides, they had been 
apart for long enough.

And yes, I have a thing for girls in long black coats. ^_^;</pre>
