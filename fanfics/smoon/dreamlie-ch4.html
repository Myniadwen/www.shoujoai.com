<h1>Dreams Can Lie (part 4 of 19)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/jupejupe.html">JupeJupe</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/dreamlie-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>&#147; Three minutes&#133;&#133;now I know I&#146;m not a patient person. &#147; Princess 
Terrestria stood in the Palace&#146;s portal room. Tapping her heeled shoes 
as she waited for the 3 minutes to pass. She wore the same gown she 
wore on the &#145;Tarefa&#146;. When the portal could be opened, she would find 
everyone in the mansion. 

&#147; 3...2...1! Shi tava oped!&#148; The portal opened at her Terrestrian 
words, silver mist flowing out. Terri practically ran through, 
arriving in the Mansion&#146;s portal room. Above her floated Princess 
Setsuna, in her gown of garnet. Terri smiled knowing that each one 
would get closet to their element as possible. - Which means&#133;&#133; 
Serenity is in the main hall. Directly in the middle. Terri walked 
through the halls and rooms. Each room had something to do with at 
least one of the elements. Made for the purpose of the Senshi being 
where they should be. The main hall had less gravity than the others. 
And there was a floating Princess Serenity in her white gown. With her 
hands and her energy she brought Serenity down, standing her upright. 
With a touch to her Moon symbol , Serenity&#146;s eyes popped open. 
Serenity fell back slightly from the new gravity. 

&#147; Oh&#133;I feel like I&#146;ve been sleeping for 1,000 years.&#148; Serenity looked 
at an older Terrestria.

&#147; Your older Terri.&#148; Terrestria smiled at her.

&#147; Indeed I am. I&#146;m now 20 Earth years and you all have been sleeping 
for 1,000.&#148;

&#147; The new ice age came so soon?&#148;

&#147; Yes and I couldn&#146;t tell you for fear of the timeline.&#148; Serenity 
looked at her friend oddly. Then decided that Pluto didn&#146;t even know 
about Terrestria. Terrestria led her silver-blonde friend to where the 
house split into more hallways. 

&#147; We must wake the others. You find Endymion and the inners. He should 
be in one of the gardens. Each scout will be closet to there element. 
I will wake Rei and the outers, alright?&#148; Serenity nodded and went 
towards her half of the Mansion. 

Terrestria went towards the fire room. There were five fireplaces in 
there. Her love would most definitely be floating in the middle. After 
a minute she came to the red-orange door. Willing it open, the room 
was hot and glowed by firelight. The Princess of Mars had a slight 
smile on her face as she dreamed. Terrestria walked to her, again 
bringing her down and standing upright. Terrestria kissed the 
raven-haired girls flaring symbol. Her eyes opened and her smile 
turned into a grin. Rei turned to her not-so-2-years-younger 
girlfriend. 

&#147; So I&#146;m guessing that we all slept, didn&#146;t age, and your&#133;20?

&#147; Have I ever told you how smart you are?&#148; They smiled and Rei kissed 
her love. Terrestria broke it after a minute.

&#147; Come on, we have to get the other 3 so Serenity doesn&#146;t beat us to 
the pool.&#148; They left for the training room hand in hand. There they 
found the tom-boy Princess of Uranus almost touching nose with the 
ceiling. Doing the same as the others, Amara woke and followed 
Terrestria to the portal room. 

Princess Setsuna was hovering in the same place as when Terrestria 
first arrived. She smiled at her knowing guardian. Raising her hands 
the mysterious woman was leveled and awakened. Hotaru was last before 
they went to meet the others in the pool room. The Senshi of death was 
found in the meditating room. As quiet, still, and dark as death, 
perfect for the purple haired 16-year old. After awakening a still 
sleepy Saturn Princess, the five of them went to the pool room. 

There they met Serenity, Endymion, Venus, &amp; Jupiter. Laying over the 
pool were Ami and Michelle. Serenity nodded to Terrestria. They moved 
in line with their separate Senshi and called them. When the Water &amp; 
Ice Senshi were in front of their leaders, they woke with a touch to 
there symbols. Sensing something was gong to happen , Rei moved over 
to her fellow inners. Serenity moved under the skylight and snapped 
her fingers. Terrestria moved over to her.

&#147; Ready?&#148; Serenity smiled and nodded. Looking towards the skylight, 
she sparkled with the Moons beams shining through. 

&#147; Oped ai shiranu!&#148; The skylight opened at the Terrestrian command. 
Serenity was through it with one flap of her wings. Endymion looked 
towards his sister, obviously confused.

&#147; Where is she going?&#148;

&#147; To wake the world from sleep.&#148;

&#147; But what if there is evil out there waiting?&#148; She smiled.

&#147; Brother don&#146;t be a fool. Serenity has strength she has yet to find. 
Do not treat her as if she is weak.&#148; Endymion blushed from 
embarrassment. - I hate it when she&#146;s right. Serenity is 2nd to only 
her. Only sometimes does she need my protection.- Endymion watched his 
girlfriend as she pulled out her Crescent wand. Terrestria walked over 
to her brother and hugged him. 

&#147; Don&#146;t fret Endymion. You had to learn though.&#148; They smiled at each 
other. Turning to the group of Senshi the silver-chestnut haired 
Princess frowned.

&#147; Guys, you can breath and chat! You look like statues!&#148; The Senshi 
giggled and moved together, talking happily about there dreams. 
Setsuna turned towards her leader.

&#147; Terri, you are not in our future. The one I&#146;ve seen did not show me 
this.&#148; 

&#147; Even the timeline has secrets you don&#146;t know Setsuna. It has shown 
you all a false future to protect the real one. Do not hunt it.&#148; The 
Plutonian frowned.

&#147; You know the future?&#148;

&#147; No, I don&#146;t. I know very little about the timeline. That is your 
area my friend.&#148; Setsuna smiled in understanding. Serenity came back 
then.

&#147; Shall we go inform the people?&#148; Everyone nodded and snapped their 
fingers. In ten seconds the eleven royals were on there way to the 
center of Tokyo. 

When they arrived the people of Tokyo bowed in respect. Shock scanned 
over their faces. A man stood to speak for the city. He stated that 
everyone accepted the rule of Princess Serenity &amp; Prince Endymion. 
Saying that the worlds population had been informed through dreams. 
Endymion smiled at this.

&#147; Well then. Shall we start the building of Crystal Tokyo?&#148;

Cheers erupted not only through Tokyo, but the entire planet.</pre>
