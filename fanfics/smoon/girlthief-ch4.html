<h1>The Rich Girl and the Thief (part 4 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/chibistar.html">Sailor Chibi Star Fighter</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/girlthief-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>     For the next few weeks, Yaten always woke up to see Seiya sitting 
on a tree branch outside her window, watching wake up.  Everyday, 
Seiya took a trinket back to the hideout and the boss, Elemental, sent 
her back to get more.  Seiya was quite please with this little 
arraignment she had worked out.  She kept her boss happy, and got to 
see Yaten everyday! ^-^!  After a few days of these visits, Yaten 
found out that she was growing fonder of the girl than a friend, she 
wasn&#39;t sure what to make of it either.  She knew that Seiya was a 
thief, even though the ravenhaired girl tried to keep it a secret.  
One day, Yaten woke up, and Seiya wasn&#39;t there, outside her window.  
Blinking, she got out of bed and saw a note on her dresser.  Opening 
it, she read.

      My Shooting Star,

              I know that you&#39;ve figured out what I am.  I had to go 
on a mission today.  If I&#39;m not back by tommorrow morning, go to the  
&#39;Cloak and Dagger Cafe&#39;.  Ask for &#39;the Young Flame&#39;.  A boy with red 
hair will come to you.  Tell him that &#39;All living things host a 
shining star within them.  Those with the brightest shines have the 
purest hearts.&#39;  Then tell him that I, Faitaa, sent you.
            Ja ne Yat-chan.

Your&#39;s Always,
Faitaa

      Yaten bit her lip and folded the paper up.  She sighed and 
decided to get ready for her piano lesson.

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Flame sulked with his hands behind his head in the corner.  &quot;Oi, 
guys, why do you think Faitaa&#39;s always gone?&quot;

      Kai shruged.  &quot;Maybe she got a boy-friend...&quot;

      &quot;NANI?!?!?!!!!&quot;

      Kai looked up and sweatdroped as there was Flame, Lightning, 
Sky, and Water up in his face.  &quot;SHE CAN&#39;T HAVE A BOYFRIEND!!!!&quot; all 
four yelled.

      Kai sweatdroped even more.  O.O;;; &quot;Alright, alright...mou, 
mou...&quot;

      Lightning sighed.  &quot;I wonder how she&#39;s doing on that job...The 
boss HAD to let Growlch take her...Growlch hates young thieves, 
especially girls.... I hate to think of the kind of danger he&#39;ll put 
Faitaa in during this mission....&quot;

      Water remained silent.

      Sky looked at his watch.  &quot;Shouldn&#39;t they be back by now?  It&#39;s 
almost midnight..&quot;

      Kai furrowed his brow.  &quot;I&#39;ll go ask the boss whats up.&quot;  he 
pushed his chair back and walked up the stairs.

      When he reached the top, he stopped as he heard voices.  It was 
Elemental and Growlch.  He frowned.  If Growlch was back..where was 
Faitaa?

      &quot;Where&#39;s the girl?!&quot;  Elemental demanded.

      Growlch growled.  &quot;The job was batched.  There was a guard.  He 
shot the girl, I grabbed her and we got away.  She was bleedin&#39; bad 
though, she wasn&#39;t gonna make it, so I tossed her over a hedge and ran 
all the way back here!&quot; he snapped back.

      &quot;WHAAAT?!?!?!?!?!!&quot; Elemental roared.  &quot;That girl is valuble you 
idiot!!!  She&#39;s the best thief I&#39;ve ever seen!  If it weren&#39;t for that 
I wouldn&#39;t keep her alive! You know that!  When I stole her from that 
hospital after her mother died I thought it was a boy!  It turns out 
that the mother had a boy a year before though.  I didn&#39;t find out she 
was a girl until she started &#39;maturing&#39;!  By then she was the nest 
darned thief I&#39;ve ever seen!  He grabbed his coat and dragged the 
other man with him.  &quot;Come on! We&#39;re going to find her!!&quot;

      Kai&#39;s eyes were wide and he could hardly believe his ears.  One 
of his hands was covering his mouth, keeping him from screaming in 
horror and outrage, the other clutching the railing so hard his 
knuckles were turning white.  He ran down the stairs when he felt that 
the two were out of ear shot.  &quot;WATER!!! SKY!! FLAME!!! LIGHTNING!!!&quot;

      Flame looked up from where he was polishing his dagger.  
Blinking, he asked,  &quot;Kai?  Whats the matter?&quot;  The ravenhaired boy 
had tears streaming down his face.

      &quot;It-its Faitaa!&quot;

      Sky dropped his food, Lightning dropped his sword, Water dropped 
his book, and Flame dropped his dagger.  Lightning shook his head and 
helped Kai sit down.

      Kai was trembling.  &quot;I...I heard the boss talking...with 
Growlch....&quot;

      Flame had a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.  
&quot;Kai....if Growlch is back...wheres Faitaa..?&quot;

      Kai looked up, trembling.  &quot;The job went wrong, she got shot by 
a guard.  Growlch dumped her over a hedge and left her there.&quot;

      Sky was outraged. &quot;NANI!!!!&quot; he roared.

      Kai shook his head.  &quot;Thats not it....when the boss found out 
she was a girl, remember how he freaked?  Its because he meant to grab 
Faitaa&#39;s older brother, not her.  He wouldn&#39;t have let her live except 
that she was a great thief.&quot;

      Water stood up.  &quot;Theres no WAY Elemental would do that to 
Faitaa!  Shes done too much for him!&quot;

      Kai buried his face in his hands.  &quot;Thats not it either.&quot; he 
mumbled.

      Lightning put a hand on his shoulder.  &quot;What&#39;s left?&quot;

      Kai looked up at them with red, tear filled eyes.  &quot;I...I 
think...shes my sister.&quot;

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

      Pain...it rushed through her body like neverending fire.  
Stumbling, Seiya limped towards the door to the hideout.  Raising her 
hand weakly, she opened the door.  Using what little strength she had 
left, she closed the door to conceal the entrance once again.  Her 
knees buckled and she fell face forward onto the floor.  Blood soaked 
the side of her shirt, a small pool of blood forming beside her.

      Lightning looked up when the boy heard a loud crash.  &quot;I&#39;ll go 
check it out.&quot; he offered before running up the stairs, sword in hand.  
When he got up the stairs he dropped the sword with a clatter and ran 
to the bloodsoaked figure on the step.  &quot;Faitaa!!&quot;  The others, 
hearing his cry, came up the stairs.
   
      Kai was on his knees beside the girl in an instant.  
&quot;Ok...there&#39;s one way to make sure...&quot; he lifted her into his arms.  
&quot;Seiya...?  Seiya can you hear me..?&quot; he shook her gently.

      Flame looked at him.  &quot;Seiya?&quot;

      Kai nodded.  &quot;That&#39;s my little sister&#39;s name...&quot;

      He moved a lock of hair from her eyes.  &quot;Seiya?  Come on 
Seiya..&quot;

      Moaning, the girl clutched at his shirt.  &quot;Y-yaten...&quot; she 
whimpered.  Kai held her close.  &quot;Seiya..?  Is that your real name 
Faitaa?&quot;  Seiya shuddered and nodded weakly.  &quot;Get...YAten...&quot; she 
whimpered again.  &quot;Cloak...Dagger....Cafe...&quot;

      Flame&#39;s eyes widened.  &quot;I&#39;m supposed to meet someone at the 
Cloak and Dagger Cafe for her in an hour..&quot;

      Kai stood up, with Seiya in his arms, ready to take his sister 
to her bed.  &quot;Go then.  bring this Yaten here...&quot;
