<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch23.html">Back to Part 23</a><pre>&quot;Ami? Ami, wake up,&quot; the familiar voice called.

Ami Mizuno opened her eyes, the blue haired young
blinking a few times to look up at her mother&#39;s
somewhat anxious face. &quot;Mom?&quot; she managed to ask,
feeling a moment of disorientation.

&quot;Do you know where you are?&quot; Nicole gently pressed,
her darker blue hair falling into concerned eyes.
Around her Haruka, Michiru, Setsuna, Hotaru and
Chibi-Usa all looked on anxiously.

Taking a moment to look around and get her bearings
Ami dryly answered, &quot;I&#39;m laying on my living room
couch, is this a trick question?&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s our Ami,&quot; Haruka grinned in relief.

&quot;You gave us a bit of a scare when you fainted,&quot; Luna
said from where the black cat was perched on the top
of the couch.

Ami winced a bit, &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I...&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right, Ami,&quot; Nicole patted her hand gently.
Looking up she smiled at Chibi-Usa and Hotaru, &quot;Do you
think you can keep an eye on her a few minutes?&quot;

&quot;Sure,&quot; Chibi-Usa said, the pink haired girl smiling
brightly.

Locking eyes with Haruka, Michiru and Setsuna she rose
as Nicole said, &quot;Let&#39;s talk.&quot;

&quot;Mother...&quot; Ami started but Nicole had already lead
the three out of the room.

&quot;Don&#39;t get up,&quot; Hotaru gently put a hand on Ami&#39;s arm
as Ami tried to rise, then the black haired girl
smiled, &quot;do you want her annoyed at you, too?&quot;

&quot;Guess not,&quot; Ami said, deciding it was the better part
of valor to lay back down.

&quot;Is she all right?&#39; Haruka demanded, her sandy blonde
hair somewhat more messy looking than normal.

&quot;I can&#39;t find anything physically wrong with her,&quot;
Nicole reassured them. Her voice went oddly flat as
she asked, &quot;As far as I can tell she collapsed from
exhaustion.. what&#39;s going on?&quot;

After exchanging looks with the others Setsuna faced
Nicole, her greenish tinted black hair flowing around
her. &quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; she said, &quot;it&#39;s all our fault.&quot;

&quot;A new enemy has appeared recently,&quot; Haruka
elaborated, &quot;and we&#39;ve been going out on patrols every
night searching for them.&quot;

Nicole sighed, rubbing between her eyes. &quot;You all know
that Ami&#39;s doing advanced course work, clubs, taking
care of Chibi-Usa and working with you... didn&#39;t you
realize that adding nightly patrols might be a bit
much?&quot; she asked.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry,&quot; Michiru repeated softly.

Nicole softened a bit when she saw the clearly
repentant looks on the three women&#39;s faces. &quot;I don&#39;t
have any authority over you,&quot; she said gently, &quot;but
please keep in mind that Ami can only be stretched so
far... before something like this happens.&quot;

Luna looked almost as guilty as the cat perched on
Haruka&#39;s shoulder. &quot;We&#39;ll try to find a better way to
handle things,&quot; she promised.

&quot;Actually,&quot; Artemis sounded thoughtful from where the
white cat stood on the floor beside them,. &quot;Ami may
have already come up with a solution.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; everyone looked at him in surprise.

&quot;We can leave Ami at home while we do the patrols,&quot;
Artemis explained patiently, &quot;then wake Ami with the
communicator if we run into a Phage.&quot;

&quot;Why didn&#39;t I think of that?&quot; Setsuna said after a
moment.

&quot;Because it&#39;s simple,&quot; Nicole noted, &quot;and most people
don&#39;t think of simple answers.&quot;

Out in the living room Ami smiled at Hotaru and
Chibi-Usa and said, &quot;Sorry if I scared you.&quot;

&quot;I think Setsuna was more worried,&quot; Chibi-Usa
volunteered, &quot;Puu actually transformed and went to get
your mom.&quot;

&quot;I wondered how she got here,&quot; Ami looked up at the
clock, noting how short of a time had passed since she
fainted.

&quot;I&#39;m glad you&#39;re all right,&quot; Hotaru said with her
usual gravity.

Before Ami could reply the others headed inside, the
group heading over to where Ami was sitting up on the
couch. &quot;I don&#39;t see any blood shed,&quot; she joked, &quot;is
everything all right?&quot;

&quot;I wouldn&#39;t hurt your friends,&quot; Nicole said
reassuringly then she flashed a smile as she added,
&quot;well, not too much.&quot;

&quot;Mom!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s all right,&quot; Setsuna hurried to reassure her.

Haruka sat on one end of the couch, meeting Ami&#39;s eyes
frankly. &quot;Your mom thinks you collapsed due to
overwork,&quot; she explained.

Ami looked away, &quot;It was probably just healing the
Phage that did it...&quot;

&quot;Either way,&quot; Michiru said, &quot;I think we have a
suggestion to solve the problem.&quot; With that Artemis
explained their idea, then they all looked at Ami to
see how she&#39;d take it.

Ami frowned as she examined the idea from all angles.
&quot;It seems workable,&quot; she finally admitted, &quot;but I&#39;m
not bowing out of patrols all together.&quot;

&quot;And we aren&#39;t expecting you to,&quot; Setsuna quickly
agreed, &quot;but we&#39;d like to save your strength for the
times we really need it.&quot;

&quot;I can&#39;t really argue with that,&quot; Ami conceded.

&quot;Good,&quot; Nicole stretched tiredly, &quot;now, if your sure
you&#39;re all right I need to get home.&quot; A smile, &quot;I have
morning rounds at the hospital tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Do you want a drive home or...?&quot; Haruka asked
curiously, nodding towards where Setsuna stood
meaningfully.

&quot;No offense intended,&quot; Nicole smiled at Setsuna, &quot;I&#39;d
rather take the ride.&quot;

&quot;None taken,&quot; Setsuna smiled.

&quot;All right then,&quot; Michiru said briskly, &quot;we&#39;ll drop
Nicole off when we all go home.&quot;

&quot;Thank you for coming,&quot; Ami hugged her mother a bit
hesitantly as she said, &quot;and I&#39;m sorry for worrying
you.&quot;

Nicole hugged her back warmly, &quot;It&#39;s all right, I&#39;m
just glad you still need me.&quot;

Quietly Setsuna said to Michiru, &quot;I&#39;m going to stay a
bit, if you don&#39;t mind.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll see you at home,&quot; Haruka nodded as they
collected Hotaru and Nicole, then the four women and
Artemis headed out.

&quot;Are you all right?&quot; Setsuna asked as she sat on the
couch by Ami, just after they had put Chibi-Usa to
bed.

&quot;Other than feeling pretty embarrassed about
fainting,&quot; Ami smiled wryly as she sat back with a
sigh, &quot;I&#39;m fine.&quot;

&quot;It wasn&#39;t your fault,&quot; Setsuna shook her head. After
a moment she added, &quot;In fact I&#39;m feeling pretty guilty
myself.&quot;

&quot;Huh?&quot; Ami looked confused.

Setsuna looked away, her eyes troubled, &quot;I&#39;m a nurse
and I&#39;m around here so often... why didn&#39;t I see that
anything was wrong?&quot;

&quot;I think my mother is overreacting a bit,&quot; Ami reached
over to squeeze Setsuna&#39;s hand comfortingly, &quot;it
probably was just normal tiredness plus healing the
Phage.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not taking that chance,&quot; Setsuna said, her voice
filled with emotion, &quot;I don&#39;t know what I&#39;d do if you
were hurt...&quot;

&quot;Setsuna?&quot; Ami looked at her in surprise.

Without another word Setsuna bent forward and gently
pressed her lips to Ami&#39;s...</pre>
