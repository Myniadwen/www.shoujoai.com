<h1>The Angel Beside Me (part 1 of 7)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amnymph.html">Amnesia Nymph</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Liar

You said I was your everything,
You said I was the one,
You played me like a radio,
You use to love that I had no shame.

Slowly she let her body into the warm water, closing her eyes. She could 
feel the hot water reach her waist as she said down in the bath tub. 
When she finally sat she too a deep breath before opening her eyes 
again. Michiru was now surrounded by the blue colored walls again, no 
longer was she trapped in her memories. Atleast, the memories in her 
head. All the memories she had about this bathroom and her were still 
fresh enough.

Another tear fell down her face.&#39;I thought I had stopped crying.&#39; The 
aqua haired girl though, smiling bitterly. It was strange to sit here 
like this, not being able to hear Haruka&#39;s voice around her anymore. 
Another sad smile had appeared on the woman&#39;s face.&#39;And I thought I 
decided not to think about her anymore.&#39; She added to her previous 
thought.

She closed her eyes again, letting the feeling of the water which 
obviously was a bit warmer than she&#39;d like, wash over her. Two days. Two 
days it had been already. Two days since Haruka had left her, two days 
since Michiru&#39;s heart got broken into a million pieces. Two damn days 
since their mission had ended. Michiru took another deep breath when she 
felt the tears that were threatening to fall. She wouldn&#39;t cry anymore, 
not over Haruka. It wasn&#39;t her fault that Haruka had left. It simply 
wasn&#39;t her fault. It was all Setsuna&#39;s fault for being so damn cute and 
seductive!

Michiru smiled at her own sillyness. Ofcourse she couldn&#39;t blame Setsuna 
for this. Haruka had fallen out of love with the senshi of Neptune and 
in love with the guardian of time. It was that easy.&#39;It&#39;s not that easy 
at all...I gave you my life Ruka and what did you do?&#39; Yes, what did 
Haruka exactly do to her? Michiru had never thought that her love for 
Haruka had gotten this deep, this difficult.

-Flashback-

&quot;I love you Ruka.&quot; Michiru had whispered as she hugged the tall blonde 
closely. She enjoyed being in Haruka&#39;s arms like this. Here she felt 
safe, here no one could hurt her. This was where she belonged.

&quot;I love you too Michi..&quot; Came the reply as Haruka&#39;s arms encircled 
Michiru&#39;s waist.&quot;I promise you that this, our mission will be over soon. 
Then I will be able to give you what you really need.&quot;

&quot;As long as I got you Ruka, I don&#39;t need anything else.&quot; Michiru had 
replied, pulling back a bit before pressing her lips to those of her 
blonde lover. The kiss was passionate and yet innocent. After a few 
seconds of just standing there, letting their mouths explore the other&#39;s 
Haruka pulled back, smirking.&quot;Promise me that you will never leave me..&quot; 
Michiru finally said. It was more a beg than anything else.

Haruka&#39;s face grew serious again.&quot;I promise Michi...As long as I live I 
will love you...and even in death you&#39;ll be the only woman I&#39;ll ever 
love.&quot; These words were obviously enough for the smaller girl because 
after Haruka had spoken those words Michiru pressed her lips to Haruka&#39;s 
once more. Kissing her passionately as she slowly pulled her lover into 
the direction of the bedroom.

-End flashback-

&quot;Liar!&quot; Michiru suddenly screamed, hitting the edge of the bath tub with 
her fists.&quot;You damn liar!&quot; At this point Michiru had broken down into 
tears once more, breaking through the only rule she had made with 
herself. Not to cry for Haruka anymore.&#39;Can&#39;t you see what you did to me 
Ruka, I love you so much...I love you...I lo...&#39; She snapped out of her 
thoughts when she suddenly heard the phone ring.

Secretly hoping it would be Haruka, who she hadn&#39;t seen since their 
break up, Michiru stood up from the tub and put a robe around herself 
before heading for the room next door. She lived in a small appartment, 
she used to live here together with Haruka but since Haruka had moved in 
with Setsuna...Well Michiru had decided to stay here for a while, until 
she had found a place of her own.

Tell me you&#39;ll love me like a star
Tell me you&#39;ll want me wherever you are,
Tell me you&#39;ll breathe me until your last breath.
Liar, Liar

As Michiru stepped out of the bathroom she imidiately entered the 
livingroom that was attached to the bathroom. Quickly she hurried over 
to the phone before it would switch over to her answering 
machine.&quot;Michiru Kaioh...&quot; She said, hoping to hear a certain husky 
voice on the other side of the line. Disappointment washed over her as 
the caller identified herself as Usagi. Usagi Tsukino, her princess, 
sailor moon but also her friend.

&quot;Hey Usagi, what can I do for you?&quot; Michiru asked politely.

She could hear the girl on the other side of the line sigh. It was 
obvious that Usagi was having a rough time over there.&quot;I am sorry to 
disturb you this late but to be honest Michiru...I need to talk to 
someone.&quot; She other replied. Michiru was kind of surprised to hear this. 
Why would Usagi want to talk to her out of all people. Most of the time 
she went to Rei or Minako with her problems. If not she would go to Ami, 
Makoto, Setsuna or even Haruka but never her.

&quot;It&#39;s okay Usagi, but if you don&#39;t mind me asking...Why me?&quot; Michiru 
asked, feeling ashamed for asking.

&quot;The others won&#39;t understand. Rei and Haruka would scold me for this. 
Makoto and Ami are too busy with...their own problems and Setsuna...I 
don&#39;t want to talk to her.&quot; Usagi&#39;s voice came. Michiru still didn&#39;t 
understand but when Usagi mentioned Ami and Makoto having their own 
problems it became clear enough that something was bothering the blonde 
princess though.

&quot;Do you want to come over?&quot; Michiru questioned, waiting for a reply. 
When she didn&#39;t get any she decided to try a different approach.&quot;You&#39;re 
not bothering me Usagi and if there is something you want to tell me or 
talk about, I&#39;ll listen to you. Not as your protector, not as senshi but 
as your friend.&quot;

&quot;That means a lot to me...&quot; Usagi&#39;s whispering voice came.&quot;Does that 
invitation still count?&quot;

&quot;Ofcourse, I&#39;ll get dressed and make some tea for us, will I see you in 
an hour then?&quot; Michiru answered. Once again Usagi didn&#39;t reply but 
Michiru knew enough. With that said she whispered a small goodbye and 
see you later before hanging up the phone. All kinds of different 
questions now entered her mind. What was bothering Usagi, why wasn&#39;t 
Usagi talking to Setsuna anymore but most important...What was this 
dizzy feeling that had taken over after she had hung up the phone.

Shaking her head, deciding to ignore her dizzy spell Michiru walked into 
the bedroom, sitting down on the bed. In front of Michiru stood a small 
cupboard, on top of it stood a framed picture. On the picture were 
Haruka, her, Setsuna and Hotaru. It was made on the day after Nehelenia 
was defeated. They had gone to a amusement park to celebrate.

Then all of a sudden, the stinging feeling in her head became stronger. 
Clenching her fist, Michiru fell back on the bed, staring at the 
ceiling. Then without even realising it she closed her eyes, drifting 
back into that damn world of repressed memories and feelings.

-Flashback-

&quot;Ah! Haruka, finally we are able to do what we&#39;ve always wanted. We can 
be just like all the normal couples around us!&quot; Michiru cheered, running 
into her lovers direction. She had a bright smile on her face that 
seemed to make Haruka feel nervous somehow.&quot;Haruka...&quot; The smaller girl 
slowed down her pace as she stood still a few inches away from her 
lover.

Her smile disappeared at seeing the look on Haruka&#39;s face.&quot;Why the long 
face, aren&#39;t you happy now Galaxia is defeated? Sure our lives will be a 
lot more quieter around the house since Hotaru went back to her fa...&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s not what...why...&quot; Haruka whispered, not looking into the 
other&#39;s eyes.&quot;I am leaving...&quot;

&quot;Tokyo?&quot; Michiru asked, feeling her heart race in her chest.

&quot;No, Michi...Michiru...I am leaving, you.&quot; Her own words seemed to pain 
Haruka as much as they hurt Michiru.

The aqua haired girl shook her head in confusion.&quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

The blonde finally looked up at the smaller girl in front of her. Their 
eyes met, only this time instead of wanting to stay locked in this state 
forever, both of them wanted to be anywhere, anywhere but here.&quot;Our 
mission is over Michiru...&quot;

&quot;I know that but why...&quot; Michiru didn&#39;t even got the chance to continue 
her question.

&quot;I&#39;ve met someone else.&quot; The smaller girl didn&#39;t need to ask any other 
questions after that. She couldn&#39;t even think of anything to say at this 
point. All she could do was stare at the blonde in disbelieve and feel 
her heart break into a million pieces.&quot;I am truly sorry but...&quot;

&quot;I still don&#39;t understand Haruka.&quot; Michiru whispered. She just couldn&#39;t 
believe what she was hearing. She must have misunderstood.

&quot;Michiru please don&#39;t make this harder than it already is...Our mission 
is over now, Uranus and Neptune aren&#39;t needed anymore.&quot; Haruka started. 
Once again she was cut off.

&quot;How does our mission ending fit in this picture? You&#39;re leaving me 
because...You weren&#39;t with me all this time just because you felt like 
you had to be with me because of our mission, did you?&quot; The smaller girl 
was surprised to see the other look at the ground at hearing that 
question.&#39;So it&#39;s true?&#39; Haruka&#39;s silence said enough althought Michiru 
needed confirmation.&quot;Just be honest with me.&quot; She added.

&quot;I wasn&#39;t with you because of our mission. Atleast part of me wasn&#39;t. My 
feelings for you are just friendship Michiru.&quot; The tomboy stated, the 
tone in her voice filled with sorrow, guilt but most of all hurt.&quot;The 
senshi of Uranus, a part of me from another time, our past. That part of 
me loves you dearly but the person I am in this life...I am sorry 
Michiru, I don&#39;t know how to explain this. I don&#39;t want to hurt you.&quot;

When the blonde gazed up again she was being faced with the things she 
hated the most. Michiru was crying.&quot;It&#39;s a little bit too late for 
that.&quot; The smaller girl cried. She didn&#39;t even take the trouble to hide 
her pain nor to wipe away her tears. She already knew that new tears 
would replace her old ones the moment she&#39;d wipe them away.

&quot;Who is it?&quot; Michiru asked after a few more moments of silence. She was 
a bit upset with the fact Haruka didn&#39;t say anything but most of all she 
was upset with Haruka breaking her heart like this.

&quot;Does it matter?&quot;

&quot;It does to me...&quot; Came the reply.

&quot;Setsuna.&quot; It was nothing more than a whisper but loud enough for 
Michiru to hear. She was surprised but at the same time not. They always 
had been close, to Michiru they always had looked like the best of 
friends.

&#39;I have been so blind...Why Ruka?&#39; Michiru wondered, clenching her 
fists.&quot;Oh...&quot; Was all she could mumble in reply.&quot;For how long?&quot;

&quot;One week.&quot; Haruka answered. She had decided to be fully sincere with 
her former lover. Michiru deserved to know the truth even though she 
knew it was hurting the smaller girl.

&quot;You should&#39;ve told me earlier...&quot; The aqua haired girl hissed, her 
voice growing colder.&quot;You decieved me. You made me believe that you 
loved me and the onyl thing you did was rub it in my face. You might&#39;ve 
never thought of me as someone you could love as a lover but I surely 
thought that of you. You played me like a damn radio. And now you got 
rid of the old tune you decided to put on a new station, a new tune.&quot;

&quot;I never...&quot; Haruka tried but for the third time Michiru interrupted 
her.

&quot;You never meant for me to what? Fall in love with you?!&quot; Michiru 
yelled, causing everyone around them to stop and stare at the fighting 
women before going on with what they were doing in the first place. 
Haruka and Michiru didn&#39;t care though, they didn&#39;t care wheter the whole 
world would know. After all here they were, breaking up after two years 
of being together in the middle of the mall.&quot;You&#39;re so cruel, you 
promised never to leave me! You promised to love me forever. I gave you 
everything I owned, had, everything that I am and...you...&quot; Michiru 
wasn&#39;t able to talk anymore, all she could do was sob inaudible things.

&quot;I am so sorry...&quot;

That was the last thing Michiru could remember hearing Haruka say before 
walking away, out of her sight and out of her life as well.

-End Flashback-

&quot;Liar...&quot; Michiru unconsciously whispered, her eyes still closed as she 
lay her hand on her forehead which now as covered with sweat. A dream, 
no a memory. A damn memory, a damn thought she should be forgetting 
about. Slowly she opened her blue eyes which were now empty.&quot;Liar...&quot; 
She repeated. As she kept staring at the ceiling she noticed her 
position.

She was still lying on her bed. The robe she was wearing had sligtly 
moved, revealing a small part of her breast and stomach. Her breathing 
was steady yet interrupted. Michiru couldn&#39;t quite explain the way she 
was feeling now. Her head was burning but the rest of her body felt like 
ice. Moving was something she couldn&#39;t do either as the feeling of being 
alone made her sick to her stomach.

Then suddenly everything went black. The last thing she could hear was 
someone whisper her name. At first the voice seemed to be miles away but 
it seemed to get closer at every second.&#39;Haruka?&#39; Michiru wondered, 
feeling a warm hand touch her cheek.

Bit by bit I feel the draft,
Just sit back and watch it burn,
Hold your eyes up to my veins,
Call out, call out my name

Tell me you&#39;ll love me like a star,
Tell me you&#39;ll want me wherever you are,
Tell me you&#39;ll breathe me until your last breath.
Liar, Liar

To Be continued...

Ah I know this fic might seem a bit dark at this point but unlike &#39;say 
hello&#39; this story will be nothing but a plain romance story. No youma&#39;s, 
no maffia, no killing characters, no nothing except for fluffy romance 
stuff. Oh and ofcourse a bit of trouble for Usagi getting rid of Mamoru 
at some point but since everyone knows that I HATE him...(insert evil 
laugh)</pre>
