	&quot;So, using the formula, the line is...&quot;

	Usagi thought about it for a moment. &quot;It&#39;s...six units long,
right?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah! You&#39;re really getting the hang of this, Usagi-chan!&quot;

	Me and Usagi are in the middle of a study session. I&#39;m kind of
surprised at how fast she&#39;s learning this material. &quot;Thanks, Mako-chan.
I really appreciate your help.&quot;

	&quot;Well, just remember your stuff for your test and you&#39;ll do
fine.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah, I guess, but I always freak out. I&#39;m not good at taking
tests.&quot;

	&quot;Only because you don&#39;t study. Anyone would freak out if they
didn&#39;t know half the questions and weren&#39;t sure about the other half. At
this rate, you&#39;ll ace this one!&quot;

	&quot;you really think so?&quot;

	&quot;I know so. Anyway...&quot; I flip to page 96. &quot;Question 6: Determine
an equation for the right bisector of the line segment joining A(3,6)
and B (-1,2).&quot;

	&quot;Ok, so we have to figure out the slope first, right? So that
is...1 over 1.&quot;

	&quot;Right.&quot;

	&quot;And the negative reciprocal, which is the slope of the right
bisector, is negative 1 over 1.&quot;

	&quot;Right again.&quot;

	&quot;...don&#39;t we need a point on the line?&quot;

	&quot;No, we just need to put in standard form. Remember,
AX + BY + C = 0?&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah. So the Y-intercept is...are we sure we don&#39;t need a
point?&quot;

	&quot;Uh...no. Ok, maybe we do need a point. Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s
(1,4).&quot;

	&quot;Ok. So the Y-intercept is...-3.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. And the X-intercept is -3 also.&quot;

	&quot;Uh huh. So the equation is -3x + -3y + ...-1, is it?&quot;

	&quot;I think so.&quot;

	&quot;Wow, that was kind of easy.&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. Oh, we forgot to make the numbers positive. It&#39;s supposed
to be &#39;3x - 3y - 1 = 0&#39;.&quot;

	&quot;Right, I remember.&quot;

	I scan the questions. Maybe there&#39;s something harder she might
not have as good a handle on. Suddenly, I see her looking at me. It...
it&#39;s kind of like she&#39;s some star-struck fan of mine. &quot;You know, you&#39;re
beautiful...&quot; she says.

	&quot;Thanks, Usagi-Chan, but the next study break&#39;s in 15 minutes.&quot;
I reply. Then I wonder why I did.

	&quot;No, I mean it. In fact...I think I love you, Mako-Chan.&quot;

	That stopped me in my tracks. &quot;You...love me?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. I don&#39;t know what it is...just the whole package, I
guess.&quot;

	I can feel my cheeks start to get hot. &quot;You&#39;re pretty too.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks.&quot;

	A long silence follows. I&#39;m not quite sure what to say. &quot;Do you
love me?&quot; She asks.

	This is getting a bit weird. &quot;Well, yeah.&quot; I say. &quot;I mean, I&#39;m
your friend and bodyguard and everything.&quot;

	&quot;Well...being my bodyguard, you&#39;d need to be a little aquainted
with it, right?&quot;

	Ok, somebody, please, hit pause for me. I do believe she&#39;s
coming on to me. I&#39;m still not completely sure this isn&#39;t a ploy to
break early. That question gets answered, however, when she kisses me.
Passionately. It kind of surprised me, but then I found myself kissing
back with equal passion. She wraps her arms around my neck. She also
slips her tongue into my mouth. This is rediculous. I am about to have
sex with my own best friend. And I&#39;m not stopping myself. For some
reason, I don&#39;t feel in control of myself, that something has awakened
inside me and is controlling me.

	I move us down to the ground. Because of my size compared to
Usagi, I make it so she lands on top of me. her hands move to my blouse
and undo the bow. The ribbon lands in a heap beside us. I move to undo
hers while she starts to undo my blouse. When she finishes undoing the
last button, she moves her mouth to my neck and rubs one of my breasts
with her left hand, the other one working to get the blouse completely
off of me. We sit up again and I finish unbottoning her blouse. Both go
the same way the ribbons did. Then she moves to unclasp my bra. I gently
push her hands away. &quot;Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;

	&quot;Yes, Mako-Chan, you don&#39;t know how long you&#39;ve been in my mind,
my thoughts, my dreams...&quot;

	&#39;My dreams&#39;...Wait! The recurring dream!

	I wake up.

---

	The next day, I feel like heck. I never did get back to sleep
after interrupting my Usagi dream again. That one was so...so vivid. It
was like it happened. I remember being very hot...and, well, aroused. I
think I _do_ have feelings for Usagi. I make it through Math class
without much of a problem. Math is one of my strong suits. You&#39;d be
surprised how much is involved in cooking. Anyways, so we get
assigned...wait. Page 96, questions 6 through 12. I flip to the page.
It&#39;s the same one. Weird. &quot;Hey, Mako-chan,&quot; Usagi says, walking up to me
at my locker. &quot;I was wondering if you maybe could help me on the
homework?&quot;

	&quot;Are you sure? Ami would probably be a better tutor than me.&quot;

	Who am I kidding?!! Why am I talking myself out of playing out
my dream? &quot;Yeah, but she&#39;s...well, a little boring at times. And she&#39;s
probably a dozen chapters ahead already. I asked you because we&#39;re on
the same level. It&#39;ll be fun.&quot; Define &#39;Fun&#39;.

	&quot;Alright. after school?&quot;

	Mako-chan seems to be a little bit out of it today. I guess she
was up late last night watching a movie or something. Or...maybe she had
the dream again. I know I did. It was so real this time. Everything. It
wasn&#39;t just the...love, it was the question too. Which strikes me as
odd. I mean, if my hunch is right, and these _are_ Silver Millenium
memories, why would the question be any more real than when this
started? In math, we&#39;re assigned the exact page and question we did in
my dream. was it a sign? I hope so, because I&#39;m going to ask Mako-chan
to a study session.

	Ba bump. Ba bump. Ba bump. Ba bump. Ba bump. This is all I hear
as I walk home with Usagi. Sure, some part of me carries on a
conversation, but the vast majority of my brainpower is stuck on fantasy
mode and is replaying my most recent Usagi dreams. &quot;Mako-chan...Mako-
chan! Hello...Moon to Jupiter, wake up...&quot; Usagi says.

	I derail my train of thought. &quot;Sorry. I was just daydreaming, I
guess.&quot;

	&quot;Anything like what you dream at night?&quot; She asks with a sly
grin.

	&quot;...Well, yes, to be frank.&quot; I say. &quot;It&#39;s been in my thoughts
lately. And now...well, the stage is being set.&quot;

	&quot;Hey, whatever happens, you&#39;re still my friend.&quot;

	&quot;Thanks. And you&#39;re still mine.&quot;

	&quot;Now, now...this is a _math_ study session, not _biology_.&quot;

	I think the dreams have been a bad influence on her.

---

	We finally arrive. She takes off her jacket and I take off mine.
We hang them up and go into the living room, and unpack our math books
and pencils and calculators. &quot;You know, last night&#39;s dream had the exact
question from our assignment.&quot; I say.

	&quot;Kind of weird, huh? Anyways, so we just have to copy that one
down...what was it again?&quot; She replies.

	I facefault. &quot;Usagi-chan...&quot;

	&quot;Just kidding. That whole 3 minus 3 minus 1 equals 0 thing,
right?&quot;

	&quot;Yeah.&quot;

	We write the equations down. &quot;7. Verify that the given point
lies on the perpendicular bisector of the given line segment. Question
a: point A(3,4), line segment BC, with endpoints B(2,1) and C(6,5).&quot; I
read.

	&quot;Ok...so first we need the slope of BC, right? So that&#39;s...4
over 4 or 1 over 1, right?&quot;

	&quot;Right. So the negative reciprocal is negative 1 over 1, and
then we need the middle of BC...which is (4,3).&quot;

	&quot;Yeah. Just by looking at that it works. It&#39;s X coordinate is
one smaller and the Y coordinate is one bigger, like the slope.&quot;

	&quot;Very good! You&#39;re breezing through these!&quot; I say. I truly am
impressed.

	Suddenly the whole scope of reality kind of changes. The way she
looks at me...kind of a starstruck fan! She _does_ want to recreate the
dream! &quot;You know, you&#39;re beautiful...&quot; she says.

	I nearly faint. Suddenly, I&#39;m incredibly nervous. Why am I
nervous? &quot;Thanks, Usagi-Chan, but we&#39;ve just started. We won&#39;t have a
study break for a while, maybe 15 minutes from now.&quot;

	&quot;No, I mean it.&quot; She says, her voice romantic and soft. &quot;I...I
think I love you, Mako-Chan.&quot;

	&quot;You love me?&quot; I say. &quot;Well, I--I&#39;m flattered. You&#39;re very
pretty yourself.&quot;

	A long silence. Anyone other than me getting a sense of Deja vu?
&quot;do you love me, Mako-chan?&quot;

	I decide to play along. &quot;Of course! I mean, I am your friend,
and bodyguard, and all...&quot;

	&quot;And to better be my bodyguard, you might need to be more
acquainted with it, right?&quot;

	&quot;Right...&quot;

	She leans forward and stops mere centimetres from my face. She
almost looks like she&#39;s about to dissolve into a fit of laughter. Must
be my reaction to what she&#39;s saying or something. &quot;Remember,&quot; she
whispers. &quot;You&#39;re always my friend.&quot;

	&quot;Always.&quot; I say softly. My cheeks are probably completely red by
now. This must be what Ami feels like whenever she turns red like this.

	Usagi leans forward and kisses me. Passionately. I return it
with the same passion, which I seem to be getting from out of nowhere.
The both of us stand up and then I break the kiss. &quot;My bed might be a
little more comfortable than the floor.&quot; I say.

	I walk us to my bedroom. I can hear my heart beating again, only
this time much faster and much louder. BA BUMP, BA BUMP, BA BUMP, BA
BUMP. As I walk in, Usagi, behind me, suddenly spins me around and gives
me another kiss. I fall backwards onto my bed. Usagi and I slip our
tongues into each others&#39; mouths, and they slide against each other,
much like our hands are to our bodies. As if on cue, both of us go for
the blouse at the same time. After both garments and bows are discarded,
Usagi almost immediately moves to unclasp my bra. I stop her. &quot;One last
time...Are you sure?&quot;

	She smiles. &quot;Yes. Very sure.&quot;

	She unclasps the front and both cups move to my sides. Then
Usagi sort of dives for one of my breasts, suckling at it gently.
Nothing in the world has even come close to feeling like this, this
exquisite pleasure. Her tongue is circling my nipple, causing my back to
arch slightly. I unclasp her bra, then my hands move to her breasts, my
thumbs rolling over her nipples. She starts to move lower, over my
stomach, my navel...she&#39;s hesitating, in case of a last-minute doubt on
my part. I don&#39;t dare move to stop her. She slides the skirt down, then
off, then moves back up. While deeply kissing me, she rubs one of my
nipples with one hand while rubbing my folds with the other. All the
while, I&#39;m attempting to keep up, but she&#39;s taking the initiative a lot
more than I am, and with my brain swimming in endorphins I can barely
think. I just...sort of react.

	She moves down again, and pulls down my panties almost painfully
slowly. Then she strokes my inner thighs with her hands, making some
reflex of mine spread my legs a bit. Another sort of dive, only for a
slightly different body part and a much more powerful reaction. I moan
aloud, throwing my head back as she inserts a finger into me. Her mouth
moves up a bit and goes to my clit, which she suckles on like she did
with my nipple.

	At the rate I&#39;m going, I&#39;m not going to be able to hold out much
longer. Then, just when I feel like I&#39;m going to lose it, she adds
another finger and curls them upward slightly--

	I hit an awe-inspiring orbit, a climax that filled every part of
my body, filled up my soul, with absolute bliss.

	I look up lazily, a half-smile on my face. Usagi-chan is looking
right into my eyes. She initiates another kiss, and I can taste my own
juices. That brought me back to reality. &quot;I--you--&quot; I start, still
trying to defragment my thoughts.

	&quot;Yes.&quot;

	&quot;Yes...How...did you do that?&quot;

---
---
---

	&quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot; I reply, my voice soft. &quot;The silver Millenium
dream played out in my head, only, like, fast-forwarded slightly. I sort
of had a blueprint as to what to do.&quot;

	&quot;I think...it worked.&quot; she says. &quot;Now...I think you deserve the
same treatment.&quot;

	She kisses me again, then we roll ourselves over. Mako-chan is
strong, and all, but kind of heavy. &quot;Uh, Mako?&quot; I say. &quot;I kind of can&#39;t
breathe.&quot;

	&quot;Oh, sorry.&quot; She says, propping herself up on her hands. &quot;That
better?&quot;

	&quot;Well, let&#39;s see.&quot; I say. I take an exaggerated deep breath.
&quot;Yep.&quot;

	Mako-chan laughs. She has such a pretty laugh...but my thoughts
are cut off by her mouth gently suckling at my right breast, one of her
hands working over my left. It produces the same reaction I got from
her. Not stopping her suckling, she starts to pull down my skirt and
panties. I lift my hips slightly to make it easier. Then she moves down,
a _lot_ slower than I was. In anticipation, I spread my legs. It&#39;s
killing me. She&#39;s at my navel, then--Gods, is she ever going to--

	She finally comes to my folds and dives for them, much like I
did. I let out a yelp as my senses get flooded with pleasure. She slips
her tongue inside me, then curls it upward like I did with my fingers.
I&#39;ve never felt anything like this. It&#39;s absolute rapture. I&#39;m...I can
feel something...It&#39;s--

	It releases itself and I moan loud and long. My body wracks
itself with pleasure, and my brain overloads itself.

---
---
---

	Usagi finally lets go of Makoto&#39;s head. I don&#39;t think she even
realized she could have suffocated Makoto. Then again, neither did
Makoto. It was kind of interesting, the paradox they created. They both
happened to have a dream with basically the same elements in it. One
tells the other about it, and the subsequent chain of events led to
their making love.

	If you fast forward to the time of Crystal Tokyo, they are still
lovers. Everyone else knows, of course. Mamorou isn&#39;t too mad about it.
He feels that love isn&#39;t something that should be kept bound to one
person or to another. But that&#39;s beside the point. After the 100th
anniversary of the genesis of Crystal Tokyo, Makoto and Usagi decided
to recreate the scene that you just witnessed. Rewind, and because the
same things happened, there was a sort of flashforward (instead of
flashback) for the two girls. So in other words, the dreams sparked the
emotions that eventually led to the event that created the dreams in the
first place. Even though the events that sparked the dream didn&#39;t exist
during the scene, they were directly responsible for it.

	I just hope there aren&#39;t any other paradoxes out there that
could have more dire consequences than this.

The end.
