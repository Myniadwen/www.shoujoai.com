<h1>1000 Words (part 4 of 9)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/blue.html">BluestAngelDust</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/1000words-ch3.html">Back to Part 3</a><pre>The miko seemed just as surprised since her expressive eyes were wide, 
her full lips parted to form a tiny, perfectly round &quot;o.&quot;

Minako couldn&#39;t think of anything to say, her mind having shut down the 
second she saw the beautiful woman at the door. She had not been 
expecting her ex of all people. She hadn&#39;t even thought Rei was into 
publicity and all that.

The lavender-eyed woman snapped out of her stupor and wordlessly grabbed 
Utena&#39;s arm, dragging her out of the office and shutting the door.

&quot;You never told me she was my next client.&quot;

The shorter woman winced at the volume of her friend&#39;s scream, which 
caused the entire floor to stop and stare. However, one look from the 
angry miko had them returning to their work quite quickly.

&quot;If I told you, you would&#39;ve said &#39;no.&#39;&quot;

&quot;So?!&quot;

Utena waited for a few minutes to give the flustered woman time to calm. 
Finally, Rei took a deep breath and stared at her superior.

&quot;I told you last week that her popularity was dropping, you should have 
known that she would come to us eventually.&quot;

&quot;But why me? Why don&#39;t you handle her case? You know my past with her.&quot;

&quot;First of all,&quot; Utena retorted calmly, &quot;you&#39;re the best music publicist 
in the market, of course when a big name like Mina comes, you&#39;ll be on 
the case. Second, I&#39;ve told you many times, business and personal life 
have to be separate.&quot;

&quot;Business and private life become the same thing when it concerns her. 
She&#39;s my ex! She left me for music. And now you expect me to help her 
advance the very thing she left me for?!&quot;

The shorter woman placed a hand on the hysterical woman&#39;s shoulders, 
piercing her lavender eyes with her cinnamon ones.

&quot;So, you&#39;ll let her be reduced to another pop star that came and went? 
No matter how much she hurt you, Rei, you&#39;re not the type to just let 
her suffer like this. And this is Minako, the love of your life, not 
some one night stand.&quot;

The miko gave a grunt, a sign that, as much as she hated to admit it, 
her boss was right. Regardless of the past, she couldn&#39;t let Minako&#39;s 
career fall to pieces.

&quot;Besides, it&#39;s your job we&#39;re talking about, Hino. Turning down a client 
as big as Minako will greatly harm your standing in the company, 
especially if it&#39;s made known that you refused the case on account of 
personal reasons.&quot;

There was another grunt of reluctant agreement. Utena could tell her 
friend was as good as on the job.

&quot;Third, think of how much it will help your career if you manage to help 
Minako. You will have salvaged what Siren destroyed.&quot;

Rei sighed weakly, her shoulders sagging enough for the shorter woman to 
wrap an arm around them. The brown-eyed Utena smiled, pinching the fiery 
woman&#39;s cheeks.

&quot;Besides, I&#39;m willing to see if I can convince the board to give you 
three weeks off with pay and a ticket to England if you pull this off.&quot;

The miko&#39;s disbelief was enough of a reason for her to ignore that fact 
that someone was pinching her cheek. Her friend almost laughed at the 
excitement in her lavender eyes.

&quot;Are you serious?&quot;

The older woman smiled and nodded. Rei ran a hand through her hair and 
sighed again.

&quot;Fine, I&#39;ll do it.&quot;

Utena smiled motherly at the younger woman, lifting her chin with a 
finger and looking into her eye with a reassuring look.

&quot;You&#39;ll be fine. I&#39;ll go in there with you if you want.&quot;

&quot;Will you?&quot;

The miko&#39;s voice sounded unusually hesitant and scared, making it appear 
child-like and so very adorable. She received a nod as her response. The 
lavender-eyed woman could not, however, make the butterflies in her 
stomach go away. Utena fixed Rei&#39;s pinstriped blouse and her necklace.

&quot;You can do this. Minako&#39;s your past, not your present, nor your future. 
There&#39;s a reason you&#39;re known as one of the best, you can do this.&quot;

Rei nodded and took a deep breath. She watched Utena&#39;s hand intently as 
it turned the knob.


Minako was snapped out of her shock when she heard the door close. She 
shook her head, looking around to see if anyone noticed her whisper. 
Fortunately, everyone was too preoccupied with Rei&#39;s abrupt exit.

&quot;That was... strange,&quot; commented Patrick.

&quot;And rude,&quot; added Mei with a pout.

&quot;So that was their expert.&quot;

Everyone turned to Jen, who sat on the couch with her arms crossed and a 
peculiar look on her face. Babs shrugged.

&quot;I guess so.&quot;

There was silence for a few seconds before Mei spoke again.

&quot;They were both preeeeetty.&quot;

Minako tired to ignore the bubbly tone that the Chinese girl used, but 
couldn&#39;t. Her statement was correct, for the most part. As far as she 
was concerned, Rei was more along the lines of beautiful but the woman 
that was with her was very pretty. She had the classic petite figure 
that Asians were known for, delicate and shy.

&quot;Of course, you&#39;d notice that,&quot; Jen commented. &quot;You love pretty things, 
after all.&quot;

&quot;As if you didn&#39;t notice them,&quot; Mei shot back dryly. &quot;Your eyes were 
glued on the one with the really long hair.&quot;

&quot;I was simply admiring her blouse.&quot;

Even Patrick rolled his eyes as if to say &#39;nice try.&#39; Minako, however, 
felt her heart skip a beat. Jen noticed Rei. Okay, so her fellow senshi 
was drop dead gorgeous and her stylist had excellent taste in women. 
Besides, neither woman was her girlfriend now. She shouldn&#39;t have a 
problem with it.

Again, there was silence and for that, the blonde singer was glad. It 
gave her time to think, though she didn&#39;t much want to. Whether or not 
Rei will be handling her case didn&#39;t matter, though it certainly seemed 
like she wasn&#39;t just another employee.

Okay, that was a complete lie. The woman she had hurt and abandoned 
might be handling her career in Japan. While she knew Rei was not the 
type to let her feelings interfere with her work, she couldn&#39;t help but 
be afraid.

And how was she going to face her ex-girlfriend after what she had done? 
Their last encounter did nothing but show her how much the miko hated 
her.

&quot;I hope this expert of theirs speaks English,&quot; commented Barbara 
suddenly.

&quot;Was Siren so lacking that they could not provide you with even that 
much?&quot;

The confident and amused voice that spoke, in perfect English without an 
accent at all, caused everyone to stand. Minako&#39;s heart pounded as she 
set her eyes on the woman she&#39;d abandoned for the second time in less 
than five minutes. She felt her mouth go dry.

Rei was standing by the door, the shock and disbelief from earlier 
completely gone. She had reverted back to her elegant, confident and 
graceful self. It was one thing seeing the miko in all her glory and 
poise when she was in a T-shirt and shorts, it was another to see her in 
business attire.

She looked absolutely delicious. A blouse and black leather pants would 
look either completely tacky or inappropriate for a publicist, but not 
Rei. It was acceptable and only added to the kind of dangerous presence 
she radiated.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry about my behavior earlier,&quot; the miko continued, a dazzling 
smile on her face as she approached the group of Americans. &quot;I suddenly 
remembered there was some... business, to take care of.&quot;

Minako hated the way her ex&#39;s eyes turned to her at the word &quot;business&quot; 
and wished those lovely lavender orbs would stay on her, but they 
didn&#39;t. Rei was announcing to her loud and clear that she saw their old 
relationship with nothing more than detachment, or else she wouldn&#39;t 
have used the word &quot;business.&quot;

&quot;That&#39;s quite all right,&quot; assured Barbara with a dismissive wave of her 
hand. &quot;I don&#39;t believe I know your name.&quot;

&quot;Oh, how rude of me. My name is Rei, Rei Hino.&quot;

The miko shook the redhead&#39;s hand before turning to the somewhat stoic 
woman beside her.

&quot;This is my superior, Utena Takahashi, Junior Vice President of Athena 
Management.&quot;

The blonde singer didn&#39;t know why her stomach dropped when she saw the 
brown-eyed woman. Perhaps it was her stoicism that bothered her. 
Whatever the case, she just didn&#39;t get a good feeling from her.

&quot;A pleasure,&quot; Barbara responded, shaking Utena&#39;s hand. &quot;I&#39;m Barbara 
O&#39;Reilly. My client, Minako Aino.&quot;

Minako tried to calm her speeding heart when Rei turned to shake her 
hand. The lavender eyes she once adored above all else pierced her own 
sapphire ones, the intensity of the gaze contrasting with the forced 
smile on the lovely face. The singer felt the blood rush to her ears, 
and her palms, to her utter dismay, started to sweat.

The fiery woman offered the blonde her hand, her heart pounding in her 
chest. Minako stared at the offered hand for a second, the shock plain 
on her face. Her eyes then wandered back to the miko&#39;s eyes before 
slipping her hand into her ex-girlfriend&#39;s.

The singer felt a buzz jump from the fire senshi&#39;s hand onto hers and 
then travel up her arm, leaving her skin tingling. She let go of Rei&#39;s 
hand as she stared into the familiar pools of lavender.

The miko was just as surprised when she felt a tingle and a spark of 
something. She thought it was impossible to get that feeling, at least 
with the blonde. Her eyes never blinked as Utena shook hands with the 
star she will, with luck, sign to the agency.

&quot;This is Jennifer Allen, Minako&#39;s stylist.&quot;

The black-haired Aussie shook Rei&#39;s hand, her green eyes taking in the 
beautiful Asian. If Minako was beautiful in that radiant and innocent 
kind of way, this woman was beautiful in the sexy and dark way. Perhaps 
she&#39;ll give her a try...

&quot;Next to her is Li Ting Mei, Mina&#39;s hair stylist.&quot;

The senshi of Mars felt a genuine smile tug at her lips at the energy 
the shorter woman exhibited. She was kind of like Usagi, a bundle of 
cuteness, fluffy and hyperactivity.

&quot;And last, Patrick Jackson, the makeup artist.&quot;

The African American man flashed Rei a pearly smile when they shook 
hands. The woman returned it with a sexy little half-smile of her own, 
hooding her eyes with her long lashes.

&quot;Please, sit.&quot;

Minako silently took her seat between Jen and Mei again as her 
ex-girlfriend and her superior sat across from them in two armchairs. 
The young woman that showed the singer and her crew in returned, waiting 
by Rei&#39;s chair.

&quot;What would you all like to drink?&quot;

&quot;Coffee!&quot; Mei answered enthusiastically.

None of the occupants of the room thought that was a good idea, but 
allowed the young woman to ask for her desired drink.

&quot;Tea, please,&quot; Minako said with a small smile.

&quot;Me too,&quot; Patrick added.

&quot;Coffee for Babs and me,&quot; Jen finished.

The girl made her exit quickly, leaving the room silent for a few 
seconds. It was Barbara that spoke up first.

&quot;Miss Hino, I heard you originally worked for The Siren Agency.&quot;

Rei was obviously surprised, though she covered it quickly with a warm 
smile. Minako felt her face heat up just from the sight.

&quot;Yes, I did.&quot;

&quot;Siren was the company that discovered your talent, was it not?&quot;

It wasn&#39;t unusual for the redhead to be on the offensive, but for once, 
her client was rather annoyed. Her manager knew so much about the 
beautiful woman that was the blonde&#39;s ex, but didn&#39;t even feel the need 
to tell the star they&#39;d be working together.

&#39;Why should she, Aino? She has no idea you even know Rei, much less what 
she meant to you.&#39;

&quot;That is correct.&quot;

The Japanese superstar tried her damn best to stare at the miko without 
being noticed.

&quot;May I ask why you&#39;re currently working for Athena Management then?&quot;

It was then the secretary decided to return with their drinks. Placing 
the cups down in front of the people that ordered each beverage, she 
took her leave.

Minako took immediate notice that Rei didn&#39;t move to make her coffee the 
way she liked it. To her annoyance, Utena took the miko&#39;s cup, and added 
two creams and three sugars, the way the miko loved her coffee.

&quot;Of course. It&#39;s something most wonder about.&quot;

The lavender-eyed woman shot her superior a warm, little smile when she 
was handed her coffee. She took a sip and closed her eyes to enjoy the 
feel of the warm drink move down her chest.

&quot;While I&#39;ll always remain thankful to Siren for giving me a chance,&quot; she 
said, opening her intense eyes to regard Barbara evenly. &quot;I couldn&#39;t 
stay where I was not allowed to reach my full potential. Appreciation 
and gratitude can only tie you down to a place that doesn&#39;t treat you 
properly for so long.&quot;

&quot;I see.&quot;

The blonde&#39;s manager liked the way Rei Hino wasn&#39;t falsely sweet and 
kissing her ass like most people she dealt with. There was an honestly 
and aloofness that she found refreshing.

&quot;So, what can you do for us, Miss Hino?&quot;

The raven-haired publicist smiled confidently and made eye contact with 
the redhead, the assurance that lay in her own confidence oozing off of 
her.

&quot;I can give you all that you lost with Siren and more.&quot;

Barbara arched a brow, surprisingly not finding the younger woman 
arrogant.

&quot;Oh?&quot;

&quot;Miss Aino-&quot;

Minako winced at the cold tone with which her ex said her name.

&quot;-has always been one of the biggest names in Japan. But seeing as how 
she hasn&#39;t returned for a long time-&quot;

The accusation in Rei&#39;s voice was well deserved, but painful.

&quot;- the fans have begun to lose faith in her. So, when she returned, they 
were ecstatic. Siren used the buzz generated to get her on every big 
name show they could. It&#39;s having the reverse affect because of 
overexposure.&quot;

Minako&#39;s crew nodded, finding the truth behind the beautiful woman&#39;s 
words. The public was simply sick of seeing the star on the newspapers, 
hearing her on every radio show and her always beign there whenever a TV 
was turned on.

&quot;So, what do you propose?&quot;

The raven-haired woman sipped her coffee, a casual action to all but to 
the blonde singer. It was what the miko did occasionally to heighten the 
anticipation or, sometimes, to stall for more time while she thought her 
plan through. She wasn&#39;t sure which it was this time, but it certainly 
created the suspenseful wait.

&quot;To start off, we take Miss Aino off the map for a while, not long, 
maybe a week or so just to get the public interested again.&quot;

&quot;That makes sense,&quot; Mei murmured with a nod.

&quot;Yes, but we didn&#39;t plan for Mina to be here for too long.&quot;

The young woman in question looked at her manager, surprised she was 
thinking about the time limit they&#39;d put on her vacation when her career 
in her native country was in jeopardy.

&quot;Unfortunately, when you hit a snag like this, careful planning often 
flies out the window. You&#39;ll have to extend your stay, I&#39;m afraid.&quot;

Rei hated the suggestion and she took another sip from her cup to keep 
herself from showing it. Having her ex-girlfriend stay in the country 
any longer would eventually kill her, especially now considering they&#39;d 
probably be working together closely.

&quot;Okay, say we do extend our trip and go with your plan to keep Mina out 
of the spotlight for a while. Then what?&quot;

&quot;We re-introduce Miss Aino to the public, but not the way Siren did.&quot;

Rei shifted in her seat to avoid looking at her potential client. That 
would make things a lot easier... theoretically.

&quot;Siren wanted max publicity and as many appearances as they could 
squeeze in, sacrificing the bond between your client and her fans. This 
time, we would try a low-key approach. Fewer shows, but staying for 
longer periods of time to give the host ample time to ask questions and 
get the fans reacquainted with Miss Aino.&quot;

Babs nodded. Everything so far would seem to work. But she wasn&#39;t about 
to jump into anything else as quickly as she had told her client to sign 
with Siren. She had been impatient and that had cost Minako dearly. She 
wasn&#39;t about to make the same mistake twice.

&quot;You can consider it, of course,&quot; the miko said with a mix of assurance 
and a hint of a warning. &quot;But not for too long. Every second you&#39;re 
under Siren&#39;s contract, the more Miss Aino&#39;s popularity drops. I&#39;m 
afraid it doesn&#39;t leave you with much choice.&quot;

Minako admired the way the hot-tempered woman handled herself. She was 
confident in herself and her abilities without being obnoxious, 
suggestive without being overbearing, and understanding but keeping her 
own best interest first.

Barbara turned to look at the blonde singer, who seemed to be in 
dreamland at the moment. She nudged her and arched a brow. The blonde 
shrugged nonchalantly, a little too casually since she was making an 
important choice regarding her career in Japan.

&quot;I&#39;ve already said it once, Babs,&quot; Minako said simply, &quot;do whatever it 
takes.&quot;

The redhead nodded firmly before turning to Rei.

&quot;We accept.&quot;

The miko was torn as to whether she should cry or jump for joy. On the 
one hand, she just landed the case of a lifetime. One the other, she 
just signed on to work with her ex for at least a month. She settled for 
a warm smile.

&quot;Good choice. Of course, since you&#39;re under contract with Siren, we 
won&#39;t be able to sign anything to insure our partnership.&quot;

&quot;We don&#39;t go back on our word,&quot; Barbara responded.

&quot;Nor do I plan on leaving with career a mess.&quot;

The singer&#39;s serious and firm comment caused everyone to look at her in 
surprised. She shrugged again and leaned against the back of the couch, 
suddenly feeling very self-conscious, what with Rei staring at her.

&quot;We&#39;ll get it straightened out,&quot; the miko said to the singer without 
malice and then, before she could stop herself, added, &quot;I promise.&quot;

Minako felt a warm fire burn its way through her entire body at the two 
simple words. It was all the reassurance she needed since she knew Rei 
never broke a promise.

&quot;But we&#39;re still under contract with Siren.&quot;

Mei&#39;s whine popped everyone&#39;s bubble. Well, Minako&#39;s, anyhow.

&quot;Yes,&quot; the publicist said with a frown. &quot;We&#39;ll take care of that too. We 
can&#39;t sign Miss Aino until we release her from Siren.&quot;

The lavender-eyed woman turned to Utena, who had been silent through the 
entire meeting. The older woman stood and walked towards the large desk 
by the window.

&quot;We&#39;ll have our best attorney on it.&quot;

The miko looked at her watch and frowned.

&quot;Kenji should be in the middle of a department meeting right about now.&quot;

&quot;So? He&#39;ll be out of there the second I tell him you&#39;re the one that 
needs his expertise.&quot;

Rei rolled her eyes and crossed her arms.

&quot;No way.&quot;

&quot;How much do you want to bet?&quot;

The senshi of Mars weighed her choices. If she was took this bet, she 
could wipe that smirk off her superior&#39;s face if she was right, but 
would face endless teasing if she was wrong. If she backed down, she&#39;d 
be mocked anyway.

&quot;Dinner at La Noche.&quot;

Utena smirked and picked up the phone.

&quot;Remember I like white wine, Hino.&quot;

The office was silent for a second as Utena wanted for Kenji to pick up. 
The miko chewed on her bottom lip.

&quot;This is Takahashi, put Kenji Parker on the phone, please. Hello, Kenji? 
It&#39;s Utena. Yes, I know you&#39;re in the middle of a meeting, but you&#39;re 
needed.&quot;

There was a slight pause and Rei shifted in her seat.

&quot;Come on, Kenji, you know I wouldn&#39;t call you if it wasn&#39;t important.&quot;

The wait was killing the poor lavender-eyed woman, who was busy trying 
to figure out which wine she would order, assuming that she lost.

&quot;Yes, I know. But it&#39;s Rei that needs you up here.&quot;

The miko swallowed and leaned forward unconsciously. Everyone except Mei 
and Minako watched with amusement, since Utena had been speaking 
Japanese. Utena smirked.

&quot;You&#39;ll be right up? Good. See you later.&quot;

The Junior Vice President turned to Minako and her crew before speaking, 
in perfect English.

&quot;He&#39;ll be up in a second.&quot;

The leather-clad woman groaned and ran a hand through her raven hair. 
Utena walked over and wrapped her arms around the younger woman&#39;s neck.

&quot;When are you picking me up tomorrow night?&quot; she half-purred in her 
native Japanese.

Rei shook her head as a smile made its way onto her full lips.

&quot;Seven thirty sound good?&quot;

&quot;It sounds great.&quot;

&quot;Wear that dress you bought last week,&quot; the miko added as an 
afterthought.

Utena walked over to the miko&#39;s desk again and picked up a few documents 
to skin through while they waited.

&quot;You know I got that for the charity auction.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; the younger woman found herself protesting almost 
childishly. &quot;I want you in that dress. I&#39;m dishing out a couple hundred 
for dinner here, you can at least humor me.&quot;

&quot;Oh, fine. But you&#39;ll have to go with me to find a replacement to wear 
to the auction.&quot;

&quot;My pleasure,&quot; Rei said in a husky whisper.

Minako bit the inside of her cheek to keep herself from saying something 
she knew she&#39;d regret. She&#39;d finally figured out why Utena bugged her 
so. She and Rei were obviously more than just friends.

The door opened just then and in walked a young man, completely out of 
breath. He didn&#39;t seem to see Minako and &#39;her people&#39; as he made a 
beeline for Rei with a huge grin.

&quot;Rei-san, I got up here as soon as I heard you needed me. How may I be 
of service?&quot;

Utena snickered, though she hid it behind the document she was reading. 
Babs and Jen didn&#39;t know what was going on, but thought the exasperated 
and annoyed expression on the miko&#39;s face was very cute.

&quot;Thanks for coming up, Kenji. But first, I&#39;d like to introduce you to 
our latest client, Miss Aino Minako.&quot;

The man&#39;s face lit up as his brown eyes widened. He turned and took one 
look at the blonde singer before freaking out. He started thinking out 
loud in Japanese about how much hotter the singer was in person and some 
things that were better left in his mind.

Minako tried desperately to keep from laughing, more amused by the young 
man&#39;s enthusiasm than disturbed by the scenarios he imagined her in. 
Mei, on the other hand, was blushing like crazy.

Rei groaned softly, not even wanting to know how embarrassed she looked. 
She was sure Utena was caught between amusement and wanting to throttle 
the ranting lawyer.

&quot;Kenji?&quot;

No response. The miko cleared her throat loudly.

&quot;Kenji.&quot;

She was once again ignored as more fantasies sprouted from the young 
man&#39;s mouth.

&quot;Kenji!&quot;

The lawyer finally stopped and turned to look at the annoyed woman.

&quot;Nani?&quot;

&quot;Kenji, what&#39;s Aino-san&#39;s nationality?&quot; Rei asked in Japanese, trying to 
keep her temper in check.

&quot;Japanese, of course.&quot;

&quot;What languages does she speak?&quot;

&quot;English and Japanese.&quot;

&quot;What language were you screaming your dreams in?&quot;

&quot;Japanese, why-&quot;

Minako and Mei watched in amusement as it dawned on Kenji that the 
singer had understood everything he&#39;s said. He bowed repeatedly, begging 
for forgiveness with a flushed face. His idol smiled.

&quot;It&#39;s all right, no harm done.&quot;

Rei thought it was nice of the singer to respond in English, to save the 
poor man from any more embarrassment.

&quot;So, what did you need, Rei-san?&quot;

&quot;Aino-san wishes to sign with us. But, she has to break contract with 
Siren first.&quot;

&quot;Ooooooh, a Siren contact, eh? This should be fun.&quot;

Barbara smiled slightly at the young lawyer&#39;s enthusiasm. The miko, on 
the other hand, rolled her eyes.

&quot;First things first, this is Kenji Parker, one of our best lawyers.&quot;

After the young man shook hands with everyone, he turned to Rei to await 
further instructions. Utena returned to her seat by the miko and waited.

&quot;Would you happen to have the contract with you?&quot;

Babs pulled out an envelope and handed it to the lavender-eyed woman, 
who passed it on to an expectant Kenji. The envelope didn&#39;t stand a 
chance.

&quot;Standard contract, it seems.&quot;

&quot;It binds Aino-san to Siren, it can&#39;t be standard, Ken.&quot;

&quot;No, of course not. But they kept most of your suggestions.&quot;

&quot;I got them from friends, don&#39;t look at me,&quot; Rei snapped almost 
defensively as she shifted in her chair.

Kenji shrugged and arched a brow.

&quot;Were you the one that suggested all clients be required to wear only 
swimsuits to all McDonald commercials?&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot;

Minako&#39;s entire crew was shocked as Babs and Mei jumped to their feet. 
Jen looked annoyed and Patrick just looked disgusted. Even Rei blinked 
at that one, she thought she&#39;d heard everything.

&quot;Are you sure?&quot; Utena asked, since everyone else wasn&#39;t quite in the 
right frame of mind to speak.

&quot;Says right here.&quot;

Kenji pointed to a line of fine print and the two other members of 
Athena leaned over to read it. Rei&#39;s expression twisted into one of 
disbelief and disgust while Utena just rolled her eyes.

&quot;That one isn&#39;t mine.&quot;

The young lawyer nodded and went back to reviewing the contract. After a 
couple of seconds, he sighed.

&quot;This is pretty much packed. I&#39;ll need at least a day or two to get 
through all of this.&quot;

&quot;Will that be acceptable?&quot;

Barbara, still a bit shocked and more than a little angry about the 
swimsuit thing, managed to regain her composure.

&quot;I don&#39;t suppose we have any other choice.&quot;

&quot;We&#39;ll do everything we can to speed up the process,&quot; the miko replied.

&quot;Here&#39;s my number,&quot; the redhead manager said with a nod, handing the 
younger woman a card. &quot;Call me when you have something.&quot;

&quot;Will do.&quot;

Minako, sensing the meeting over, stood. She wanted nothing more than to 
run out of the office as fast as she could, while another part of her 
wanted to stay with Rei. Even if the beauty was ignoring her and hated 
her beyond description, simply being in her presence made the singer 
feel more... alive.

&quot;Thank you for your time.&quot;

Barbara was pleased with the meeting and Athena management in general. 
Something about Rei Hino and the whole dynamic of the three in the room 
made her feel she was leaving her client&#39;s fate in good hands.

&quot;Thank you for considering us. It was a pleasure meeting you.&quot;

The miko felt her chest constrict as it came time to shake Minako&#39;s hand 
once again. Her mouth went dry, though she kept that ridiculous grin 
plastered on her pretty face. She was even more nervous when she saw not 
even a flicker of anxiety in her ex&#39;s baby blues.

Utena watched with a guarded gaze as Minako and Rei regarded each other 
hesitantly. The singer was the one to offer her hand this time. The 
miko, wanting to appear as in control as ever, took the hand and shook 
it firmly. Both women were excellent actresses, but the brown-eyed 
Junior V.P. would see the emotions playing in their eyes.

Though the blonde singer knew her ex hated her as much as she did at the 
beginning of the meeting, she felt that the hostility had lessened. 
Maybe it was the way the forced smile was a little larger than when they 
shook hands the first time. Maybe it was the way her lavender eyes 
weren&#39;t as cold as steel. The leader of the senshi wasn&#39;t stupid enough 
to believe that anything other than their business agreement was the 
cause of these changes. But she basked in the thought of &quot;just maybe&quot; 
anyway.

&quot;It&#39;s great to do business with you and a pleasure to meet you.&quot;

&#39;Again,&#39; Rei added mentally. She felt her heart skip a beat when she 
received a bright smile in return. She could tell from the singer&#39;s eyes 
that she knew exactly how the she felt about her, but the smile seemed 
genuine, for some reason.

&#39;The Minako affect,&#39; the miko thought dryly, with a hint of unconscious 
fondness.

&quot;Same,&quot; was the blonde&#39;s short, but genuine, reply.

The 5.8 seconds hand shake seemed to last forever to the two before they 
parted. The star moved to shake Utena&#39;s hand while Rei turned to Jen.

As the elevator door closed, Kenji told his two fellow Athena Management 
employees that he would get to the contract as soon as possible. Utena 
thanked him while Rei returned to her office. She didn&#39;t bother closing 
the door; her superior would just walk in without knocking anyway.

Her secretary had already cleared off the coffee table by the time she 
sat down in the large, leather chair behind her desk. She stared blankly 
at the black computer screen while Utena entered a second later and 
closed the door quietly behind her.

&quot;That could&#39;ve been worse.&quot;

&quot;Oh, yes, of course,&quot; was the sarcastic reply.

&quot;Hey, at least you landed the contract, in a way. You know what this 
means?&quot;

&quot;Cha-ching?&quot;

Utena rolled her eyes as she sat down on the miko&#39;s desk.

&quot;No, your reputation, along with Athena&#39;s, is going to sky rocket.&quot;

&quot;If I can pull this off.&quot;

&quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous,&quot; the Junior V.P. scolded. &quot;Of course you can. You 
wouldn&#39;t have been assigned to it if you couldn&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;I don&#39;t know, Siren&#39;s made a complete mess.&quot;

&quot;And you&#39;ll clean it up.&quot;

The older woman supped Rei&#39;s cheek, causing her to smile. They were both 
silent for a split seconds before spoke again, softer and gentler this 
time.

&quot;Besides, you promised.&quot;


Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii, everyone. How&#39;re you guys doing? Good, I 
hope.

So, I decided to get off of my fat ass after three months to update. I 
know it&#39;s taken a while, but this chapter has been exceptionally slow in 
coming to me. Why? Because it&#39;s BOOOOOORING! It&#39;s just a filler of 
sorts, and I tried to keep it relatively emotion-free so you can see how 
this meeting really affected Rei and Minako as the story progressed.

Ah, Kenji makes an appearance, as a perverted lawyer this time and not a 
shy little guy. Oh well!</pre>
