<h1>Heartfelt Desires (part 31 of 41)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/seraphy.html">seraphydragon</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/hartfelt-ch30.html">Back to Part 30</a><p><u> (Moon Palace, before dawn)</u></p><p>The night’s festivities have long drifted away 
into the blanket of darkness. Gone was the sound of music, of the intermingling melodic 
voices of the violin and piano... No longer was the soft swaying with a cherished loved one, 
the playful teasing and embarrassed expressions… Even the joyful bursts of laughter that 
once graced the spacious halls were absent; for each and every element had bid adieu with 
the good-natured retreat of the guests and inevitably plunged the once brightened, ancient 
world back into its former dormant state.</p><p>However, there was unspoken forgiveness. 
Even without the golden light to warm its pale complexion the palace remained unyielding in 
its guard of the sleeping souls shielded behind its walls. Many of whom were tuckered out, 
leaning into one another in warm embraces with a rare peace of mind as they dreamed of 
peaceful days.</p><p>They dreamed and dreamed, yet none of them sensed the sudden stirring 
within a particular palace corridor.</p><p>The intruder: The small form, with all of its 
training, skillfully crept through the silent structure. From the main entrance it scaled 
the nearest staircase to the second floor and crawled stealthily up to a closed door where 
it paused. It then craned its head towards the frame, picking out random, content sighs and 
mild shuffling. With an impulse of curiosity it reached for the door handle, deadly mindful 
of the unavoidable click as the door was opened a cracked. A bedroom, it noted. There were 
two occupants sound asleep atop of the sheets. A blonde woman in simple pajamas was snuggled 
up against another in a black dress. For an instant, her companion’s brow was furrowed and 
she dangerously stirred. Had the stranger been noticed?</p><p>Without wasting time the door 
was closed and the intruder continued along its way.</p><p>It wasn’t the 
target.</p><p>Wordlessly without complaint it infiltrated further, sneaking through the maze 
undetected by the other great energies that inhabited the sacred territory. Eventually, 
however, its senses lead it to the unusual gathering of three such energies. Hidden within a 
narrow corridor, deep within the palace, was the medical ward.</p><p>As it did with the 
others, the intruder opened the door but slipped in unnoticed by its dreaming occupants. To 
its left, in the nearest bed, a short, dark-haired girl protectively cradled a different 
blonde-- the stranger flinched at the sight. There was an increased sense of awareness 
flickering in its gleaming eyes as it tiptoed around the close pair towards the lone bed off 
to the far side. Unlike the previous ones that the intruder had encountered, this individual 
was alone. Her long green hair was spread across the pillow in what may have been a result 
of a restless sleep. The sight of her exposed neckline especially drew the intruder’s gaze, 
stirring almost wild excitement within its instinctive being; however, it hadn’t lost focus 
on the danger to its existence one bed away.</p><p>The assassin threw one last glance at the 
sleeping dark-haired girl before returning its entire focus onto the solitary woman. It was 
almost too perfect. It ventured forward with a dagger clutched in its black palm, 
determination and confidence radiating off of its posed form. Its victim inhaled and exhaled 
deeply. This was it-- the steel blade reflected its victim ominously at its 
zenith…</p><p>Down! Crimson eyes flew open.</p><p>“KREEEEE?!” A blanket was thrown into its 
tiny form. It quickly became tangled within the cloth, unable to break free from the 
pestering material in time to counter its opponent’s assault. A long staff swung around and 
connected with the intruder’s mid-section, sending it sprawling to the floor and its weapon 
clattering off to the side.</p><p><b>Thud!<br></b><i><b>Crunch!</b></i></p><p>The tip of 
Setsuna’s weapon came crashing down into its left shoulder, pinning it forcefully against 
the cold, tiled floor with a sickening crunch as her reward.</p><p>“Setsuna, wha!?” Hotaru 
was awake now. Both she and Usagi gasped upon catching sight of the beast struggling against 
Setsuna’s grasp.</p><p><i>What is that?</i></p><p><i>It’s that thing!</i> Hotaru narrowed 
her eyes.</p><p>The former advisor’s crimson eyes blazed even more furiously as she stared 
down the lowly foot soldier. Impatience, disgust and anger were among the most apparent in 
her expression. She continued to hold the struggling pawn relentlessly, her heart completely 
absent of any sort of compassion—a fearsome sight that neither of the twins were fortunate 
enough to have witnessed until now.</p><p>Usagi was confused.</p><p>“Setsuna, what...?” 
<i>Why? Why are you torturing it? Why are you making it suffer like this?! This isn’t like 
you. This isn’t like you at all! </i></p><p>“Be careful Usagi.” Hotaru held her 
closer.</p><p>“Hotaru…?”</p><p>“That is one of his.” As she allowed her sister to ponder 
upon her words, Hotaru had to admit that something was off about their guardian’s 
behaviour.</p><p><i>Setsuna.... Why isn’t she finishing it 
off?</i></p><p><i><b>Crunch!</b></i></p><p><i><b>...Crunch!</b></i></p><p><i><b>Crunch!</b></i></p><p>“Apollo, 
even in death your arrogance knows no bounds.” As Setsuna spoke slowly, her crimson eyes 
were full of emotion. The creature continued to struggle. “You have finally found our 
location, yet you send this solitary, disposable pawn to carry out our destruction? Not only 
have you wasted an opportunity but you have also under-estimated your opponent. This 
critical mistake will be your downfall!”</p><p>The creature beneath the woman’s staff 
abruptly went limp and laid still. To the side, Hotaru began to shiver and her eyes 
widened.</p><p><i>This feeling…</i> Her breathing quickened. <i>No, it-- it can’t 
be!</i></p><p>“Hotaru, what’s wrong?” <i>She’s shaking! </i>Usagi realized.</p><p>An orange 
light briefly lit around the assassin’s body. And then, very slowly, a grin of insanity 
broke across its bleak face. Its eyes were no longer its own, they were filled with 
amusement and mockery instead of pain.</p><p><b>“…</b><b>Set…una…”</b> A deep, raspy voice 
called out. The being then began to laugh upon seeing the color drain from the woman’s 
face.</p><p>“<b>AHAHAHAHAHAHA---!!!!!!”</b></p><p>“...Geh.”</p><p>Having enough, Setsuna 
summoned her power and stunned the beast in its crimson light. The possessed creature 
shrieked in excruciating pain. Yet even as its body was disintegrating away, momentarily its 
gleaming red eyes landed upon the twins clutching onto one another. Its eyes widened and 
time seemed to slow-- the sight of the blonde one stirred a memory within itself. Her face 
and her 
eyes…</p><p><b>“…</b><b>Arte…mis?”</b></p><p>“HAAAAAAH!”</p><p><i><b>CRACKLE!</b></i><br><i><b>Shrooooom!</b></i></p><p>Black 
particles dispersed across the room, and a lone sphere of light was released to the dark sky 
outside.</p><p>Setsuna dropped to one knee and grabbed at her staff for support. Her body 
quivered with rage.</p><p><i>Don’t… say her name. You don’t deserve to say her name like 
that!</i></p><p>“Setsuna!”</p><p>“Setsuna, are you all right?!”</p><p>Both of her charges 
were at her side in an instant. She looked to each of the worried faces and found herself 
disturbed by the hints of fear glimmering in their bright eyes. When she re-evaluated her 
appearance she instantly realized the problem. Slowly Setsuna inhaled and exhaled, willing 
her mind to clear and her troubled heart to calm itself. Only once did she achieve control 
over the raw emotions did she address the girls.</p><p>“There is no need to worry, I am 
fine.” She assured them. “However, I am afraid that we can no longer afford to rest. He has 
found us. Lady Hotaru, Lady Usagi... will you please go and awake the others? Tell them that 
there is an emergency meeting and that they should all gather at the main palace entrance 
immediately.” She saw the exchange of hesitant glances. “They may still be tired, but it is 
imperative that they all attend. This is a very urgent matter that must be addressed as soon 
as possible.”</p><p>The twins nodded to one another and ran off with their mission in mind, 
leaving the former advisor alone in her restless thoughts.</p><p><i>It was only a matter of 
time until it came to this…</i></p><p>Setsuna rose herself to her feet, feeling her legs 
somewhat shaky with the burdening weight upon her shoulders. The happier times of the past 
presented itself to her with a distraction in mind; a time when she, Artemis and Apollo were 
inseparable, where she could readily smile. Yet as quickly as the warmth had touched her 
lonely heart it died out in an instant, and her expression steeled.</p><p><i>None of it 
matters anymore.</i></p><p>She exited the room to where her audience would gather 
shortly.</p><p><i>We must win this war.</i></p><p><b>Tup…tup…tup…</b></p><p><u>(Palace Main 
Entrance)</u></p><p>Setsuna descended the steps into the main entrance and was greeted by a 
group of sleepy stares. Some of the girls rubbed their eyes tiredly, while others either 
stared out into space with glassy expressions or were about to nod off standing up. Haruka 
and Rei, namely, were noticeably awake but were downright grumpy. The glare the Martian eyed 
Setsuna with did nothing for the woman or the sleepy Venusian who clutched at her 
shirtsleeve for support. Meanwhile, Haruka to say was less than impressed; as always, her 
impatience bared its fangs.</p><p>“What the freakin’ hell is going on here Setsuna?! Do you 
what time it is? You better have a good reason because if it’s another training session, I 
swear...!”</p><p>The addressed party unflinchingly met those furious green eyes.</p><p>“We 
must prepare for war. The time of battle is now upon us.”</p><p>Eyes shot open and people 
jolted awake; suddenly everyone was on the alert. Uranus’s face paled upon hearing the 
unexpected response, and Rei became apprehensive. Mutters dashed about the room, but the 
former advisor ignored them.</p><p>“Shortly before I summoned all of you here, one of 
Apollo’s henchmen had breached our headquarters. There is no longer time to train or rest. 
Unless we make our move now, we will lose our opportunity to gain the advantage. He is 
foolishly under-estimating our power.”</p><p><i>Apollo…</i> Hotaru bit her bottom lip at the 
memory of the morning incident. The person whom she trusted, the uncle she fought to become 
strong for, to protect, to wish to be praised by…the one who ultimately betrayed her. When 
the shadow assassin’s eyes had fallen onto her, her blood ran cold and she 
knew.</p><p><i>There is no mistaking it. It was him!</i></p><p>“So, then what shall we do?” 
Michiru inquired. “These preparations... do they not include informing our people of our 
intent? After all, even our small group alone cannot win a war against an entire army 
without aid.”</p><p>Minako’s heart skipped a beat. If what Michiru was saying was true, 
then…</p><p>“Yes, that is correct.” Setsuna confirmed. “To be precise, I will require all of 
you to return to your planets to formally pledge your aid to this war. Although many of your 
commanders may have introduced such a proposal to the military ranks, it is absolutely 
imperative to gain the support of the people. We need to unite the masses of each planet 
under a strong ruler, and then unite the rulers under a common banner. That… will be our 
mission objective.”</p><p><i>A common banner…? </i>The others pondered.</p><p>“In the past 
after the destruction of the Moon Kingdom, your mentors joined forces under <i>The Planetary 
Alliance</i>. Even before the death of her Majesty, Queen Serenity, there secretly had been 
talk of a possible rebellion amongst Apollo’s court. Many wished for Queen Serenity to take 
her brother’s place as ruler of the Gods.”</p><p>“Our mother?” Usagi blinked back. She never 
imagined that her mother was such an important political figure.</p><p>“However… it was not 
meant to be. Though the former court of Apollo had successfully overthrown their Lord, none 
of them could agree upon the next ruler. Both siblings, Apollo and the good Queen, were 
dead… and Serenity’s heirs were thought to have perished long before the war. Thus, they 
chose to live their lives as they pleased and came together once a year to commemorate their 
friendship and victory.”</p><p>“Before they all were…” Haruka bitterly reminded 
her.</p><p>Makoto peered at the gloomy faces around her, finding her own throat beginning to 
constrict from personal memories.</p><p><i>No one ever wants to admit that they’ve lost a 
loved one. Especially people like us… Because, even though we have so much power, it didn’t 
come without a price. Still… we can’t sit around and just start feeling sorry for ourselves! 
There’s gotta be some way to cheer my friends up!</i></p><p>She crossed her arms and 
frowned.</p><p><i>Wait, I know!</i></p><p>“Well, I don’t know too much about this whole 
business of Gods ruling Gods, but what we want to concentrate now is on choosing a name for 
our group, right? Why not use the old one, The Planetary Alliance? I don’t think our goals 
differ that much from the previous rulers. We all want peace, just like they did. 
Right…?”</p><p><i>For old times’ sake… for one last time…</i></p><p>“You know, that’s a 
really good idea Makoto.” Uranus crossed her arms and glanced around at the others. “What do 
you guys think? Are there any objections?”</p><p>The others shook their heads.</p><p>“Okay, 
great! The Planetary Alliance it is then!” The shorthaired blonde momentarily grinned before 
diverting her attention back to their strategist. “So, Setsuna…! Now that we’ve decided on 
that, you want us all to go back to our planets, right?”</p><p>“Correct. However, I 
understand that certain circumstances involving your separate cultures may prove to be 
somewhat difficult in convincing your people of this new alliance.”</p><p>“Okaaay…? Then 
what do you suggest?”</p><p>“Oh, I know! A projection!” Ami cut in. Heads turned in her 
direction, making the ruler somewhat embarrassed by all the attention. “W-Well...What 
Setsuna is trying to say is that our people may not question us, the rulers... but rather… 
our comrades. But if we modify our communicator system, we can use it to simultaneously show 
all of us agreeing to the alliance. Right now, I do not see it being a problem for the 
majority of us, but there may be some difficulty in convincing Minako and Michiru’s people 
to join the alliance due to issues resulting from Ares’s actions. It is very likely that 
many of them still regard him as the… the leader of Mars… Perhaps, the Martian soldiers 
too…” Her voice trailed off.</p><p>Rei stared at the floor, unsure of how to respond to the 
shy comment.</p><p><i>As much as I hate to admit it, she’s right. Ares is still the official 
leader of Mars! If he showed up in the middle of battle, will the soldiers still obey my 
orders or...? </i></p><p>The subject dragged up a certain first officer’s words from the 
depths of her memory.</p><p>“<i>I...I was wondering if you would consider taking over as 
leader... permanently.”</i></p><p>His words had made her heart waver uncertainly in the 
past, and they still did now.</p><p>“<i>I know I’ve always praised Ares. I’ve admired him 
ever since I was a small boy, and in a way, I still do.”</i></p><p>“<i>But... what good does 
that do when he’s never around? He disappeared on us without a word! If he still hasn’t 
returned to us in our time of need, then he never will!”</i></p><p>A deep, contemplating 
look entered Rei’s dark eyes.</p><p>“Rei…?” Minako could feel the air around her partner 
becoming distorted.</p><p>“If that is the only thing holding us back...Then I will try for 
permanent leadership!” She declared.</p><p>“Wha—But Rei!” Haruka couldn’t believe this. Did 
she even know what she was saying? “Becoming a God is a really big deal! And besides, if you 
want to become the ruler, you have to...!”</p><p>“Uranus is right.” Setsuna said as calmly 
analyzed the Martian’s resolve. “It is a tradition amongst the planets that the ruler can 
only be one of God or Goddess rank… and one cannot achieve such a rank if they cannot find 
or defeat the current ruler.”</p><p>There was a frown on the Martian’s face, but the young 
woman didn’t make any effort to protest. Setsuna could see it in her eyes—she was carefully 
re-evaluating the complications that would accompany the choice of such a decision. It would 
be wise if she listened to the advice of her friend.</p><p>With that, Setsuna then dismissed 
the girls with a final parting advice.</p><p>“As Mercury has said, we will operate using the 
communicator system. Do not begin the intermission until <i>all</i> of you are ready. I 
cannot emphasize this enough. If what intended to be the unification of all of the planets 
and there was a ruler missing, then it may foster doubt amongst the people.”</p><p>Rei said 
nothing, but she knew that Setsuna was referring to her. The burden of this mission rested 
heavily on her shoulders.</p><p><i>After Ares’s recent rampages on Neptune and Venus, the 
ties to the red planet have been strained, if not severed. If we cannot gain the support of 
the people of Mars and convince the people of the other planets that their ruler is no 
longer Ares, then... we may find ourselves a few allies short. </i>Setsuna glanced over to 
Michiru, and then back to the Martian and Venusian before her.</p><p><i>The woman from 
Neptune may have the ability to sway her people accordingly under her command…however… it is 
those two that worry me.</i></p><p>“You are all dismissed. When you feel that you are ready 
to depart, please inform either Luna or Artemis and they will lower the planet shield for 
you. Lady Hotaru,” she called to the girl as the others walked away, “...before you go, a 
word if you please?”</p><p><u>(Minako’s room, Minako)</u></p><p>Minako dragged herself into 
the room, finding herself zapped of all her energy. The wind had been blown out of her sails 
since the mention of returning home.</p><p><i>I can’t believe it. I have to go back home 
already?</i></p><p>The blonde pulled herself together long enough to reach the dresser and 
began to pack her away her clothing. As she listlessly packed her belongings in a 
mechanical-like fashion, her mind wandered to the memory of the night not too long before. 
It was surreal, a dream-like play that ran itself over and over again, fondly, within her 
heart. When she thought her crush would declare her dislike for her, she had—a blush crept 
over her cheeks at the memory, disrupting her concentration on her chores long enough to 
recall the softness of a certain woman’s lips.</p><p>“Ahh! Get a hold of yourself Minako!” 
She was all but practically squealing in delight. A part of herself couldn’t believe that 
Rei had actually kissed her because she wanted to and she was eternally grateful that Rei 
wasn’t around to see the spectacle.</p><p><i>But still, she said she liked me. </i>She 
brought a hand up to her lips. <i>She said she liked me as more than a friend. She kissed 
me...And then we danced together and she held me close with those strong arms of hers. When 
I leaned against her, I could hear her heart beating in her chest. She was so 
warm...</i></p><p>“Oh! What-am-I-doing?!” <i>If I keep daydreaming I’ll never finish!</i> 
“Jeez...I can’t believe I’m getting so worked up over cuddling...”</p><p>She stopped at the 
thought. But then, she slowly smiled. <i>Maybe...it’s just because I love her that 
much.</i></p><p>“Okay! So, the sooner I finish, the sooner I can go and see her again!” She 
punched the air. <i>Let’s do this!</i></p><p>With that motivation in mind, she bolted all 
over the room like a whirlwind and swept everything up into their proper bags and suitcases 
within minutes.</p><p><b>Tup! Tup! Tup!<br>Tup! Tup! Tup!<br>Tup! Tup! 
Tup!</b></p><p><b>Click</b>.</p><p>“Whew.” The sound of the suitcase being shut coaxed a 
sigh a relief from the Venusian. It had actually taken several of attempts, including 
sitting on it, to get it to close. “All right... so let’s see, do I have everything? Hair 
brush, toothbrush, clothes, books... check, check... okay! That’s everything! Now, there’s 
only one thing left to do.”</p><p>Minako cheerfully whipped out her communication device, 
but when it came to typing in the channel code she hesitated. Her fingers were frozen and 
shaking above the buttons. The last time she had used her communicator, it had been shortly 
before she departed Neptune.</p><p><i>I can’t believe this. What am I afraid of...? It’s not 
like I’ll--I’ll see her face again…</i></p><p>A sad frown crept onto her pink lips and she 
shook her head. With that she hurriedly pounded on the buttons and opened the 
channel.</p><p><b>…</b><i><b>Channel secured… opening 
transmission…</b></i></p><p><i><b>Bleep!</b></i></p><p>The projection emitted by Minako’s 
communicator revealed the inside of a space shuttle bridge. In front of the main monitor, 
facing her, the intended presence that the Venusian had wished to contact was Sapphro. Her 
friend’s hair was still short, but she was relieved to see that the blonde hair was gone and 
replaced with its natural blue colour.</p><p>“M-Minako?!” He shouted at the sight of her. 
“How are you doing?! Are you all right? Have you been eating well? I’ve been worried sick 
about you! Why haven’t you contacted me earlier?!”</p><p>“Sapphro, I told you where I was 
going to be, didn’t I? And as you can see, I’m perfectly fine. You don’t need to worry if I 
don’t need to contact you every day.” She smiled despite herself. At least one thing hadn’t 
changed.</p><p>Sapphro relaxed his pose and calmly fell back into his seat with a thoughtful 
expression.</p><p>“You’re being way too overprotective. Admit it.” Minako urged. 
“C’mon…”</p><p>He reluctantly sighed and placed his hands up into the air. “All right, all 
right... Maybe, I-I am being a little overprotective.”</p><p>“A little?” She arched an 
eyebrow.</p><p>They both stared at one another in silence, Minako with her dominating ‘I 
know I’m right’ stare versus Sapphro’s ‘I hate you’ glare. Finally, they both had to burst 
out into laughter at their silliness.</p><p>“So anyway,” Minako asked once she caught her 
breath back. “How is everything back at home? Is everything going all right?”</p><p>“You 
mean over here? Ah… well, it’s not too bad, I guess. Taya is trying to handle everything as 
best as she can, but there’s only so much that she can do. A lot of people are still 
confused whether or not…” His voice trailed off.</p><p>“About?”</p><p>“Oh, speaking of 
which, when ARE you coming home?”</p><p><i>Why did he… just change the subject?</i> Minako 
wondered. He was smiling unusually brightly all of the sudden as well.</p><p>“Actually, 
that’s what I wanted to talk to you about. Everyone is going to be returning to their 
planets for a bit…so… I guess I will be too.”</p><p>Sapphro leapt to his feet on the other 
end and slammed his palms onto the panel board. “Really?! You mean you’re actually going to 
be coming home? That’s great! Should I come and get you?”</p><p>“If you aren’t too busy, 
that would be nice…”</p><p>“Busy? Who’s busy?! Okay, don’t move all right? I’ll be there as 
soon as possible! Hang in there kiddo!”</p><p><b>Bleep!</b></p><p>The line was terminated, 
and Minako slowly eased herself over to the bed to rest.</p><p><i>That’s strange... Sapphro 
seemed a little too excited to know that I was coming home. I mean, I knew he would be happy 
to see me again, but still… something… felt off. Is there a problem at home that he can’t 
tell me about? The people are confused? About what though...?</i></p><p><b>Knock, 
knock.</b></p><p>“Come in.” She sat up when she saw who it was. “...Rei! Hi!”</p><p>The 
Martian peeked into the room, and seemed hesitant about entering. “Umm... Hi? Did I...come 
at a bad time?”</p><p>“Pssh, no way! C’mon, come in!” She had to laugh when Rei yelped as 
she was given a big hug. The blonde couldn’t help it; Rei was like a giant teddy bear, well 
at least on the cuddly aspect.</p><p>“H-Hey...” She flinched when Minako suddenly gave her a 
peck on the cheek.</p><p>“I was actually just finishing. So, what do I owe the pleasure of 
this visit? Did you sleep well last night?”</p><p>Rei turned red as a beet. “W-Well... I 
uhh...” She nervously looked away.</p><p><i>Ahh... she looks so cute! </i>“It’s okay, I’m 
just teasing you. I’m...well, how to put it... really happy that you stayed with me. I 
didn’t even realize when I fell asleep.”</p><p>“Well, you did look kind of tired. <i>And 
</i>you had been studying...” She rolled her eyes, feigning disbelief. 
<i>Surprisingly...</i></p><p>Minako hit her arm and Rei snorted. “I was studying! But it’s 
just—none of us really had much time to sleep over the past few days so I was just a little 
more tired than usual.”</p><p>Rei couldn’t argue with that. “Yeah...especially with 
Setsuna’s night-time exercise.” she muttered in annoyance.</p><p>“But it was so much 
fun.”</p><p>“...You thought it was fun?”</p><p>“No. That was sarcasm Rei.” Minako stepped 
away from the woman and stretched her arms. For some reason, Rei couldn’t pull her eyes 
away. “...Mmm...Anyway! What’s up? Did you come to say good-bye before you left?”</p><p>She 
spun around and startled her companion. Rei just realized that she had been 
staring.</p><p>“O-Oh! Actually, yeah...I did.” She reluctantly admitted in 
embarrassment.</p><p>“Aww...that’s so sweet of you.”</p><p>“...Mina.”</p><p>“Hmm...?” She 
was surprised when Rei brought her hands up and steadied her by the shoulders so that they 
were looking face to face.</p><p>“Are you really okay with this? Going back home I 
mean...”</p><p>It took a moment for the words to register. “Oh. 
Well...”</p><p>“Honestly.”</p><p>Minako averted her gaze. She had to use that word, didn’t 
she?</p><p>“Honestly...I don’t know. I’m not really sure what to think, I mean... it just 
doesn’t really feel real. Becoming a ruler, and becoming responsible for everyone’s lives... 
That’s a lot of people Rei. It’s almost a little scary. And I know it’s silly, but I can’t 
help but hope that my family will be there when I go back. I still can’t quite 
believe...that they’re really all gone.” She felt Rei squeeze her shoulders and shook her 
head. “I shouldn’t complain. I mean...at least, I had a family.”</p><p>Minako half-expected 
the Martian to get offended by the comment, but to her surprise Rei was calmly looking back. 
She didn’t look angry, but perhaps a little sad.</p><p>“Did you even know them?” She finally 
asked.</p><p>“...A little. Or, at least I think I used to.” Rei quietly replied. “My 
memories of back then aren’t very clear, so...I can’t really say.”</p><p><i>So that’s why 
you went after Nozomi like that.</i></p><p>Minako reached up and cupped her cheek. “...I’m 
sorry.”</p><p>Rei grasped her hand and leaned into it for a moment. “It’s not your fault. 
And besides, it really has nothing to do with who I am now. It’s in the past.”</p><p>“I 
see...So, then how do you feel about going back home? I mean, it sounded like Setsuna was 
really coming down on you during the talk.”</p><p>“Even if she was, she’s right. If I don’t 
get my act together, it can cause trouble for everyone.”</p><p>“Rei...” She was surprised to 
see her smile back.</p><p>“It’s fine. I’ll admit that I am a bit nervous...but I’m sure 
it’ll all work out in the end.”</p><p>“...Yeah. I’m sure you’re right.” Minako finally 
smiled back. “But for what it’s worth, I think you’d make a great ruler.”</p><p>Rei couldn’t 
be sure, but did her heart just flutter?</p><p>“Heh. You’re getting just as bad as 
Haruka...flatterer.”</p><p>“Only when it’s deserved,” Minako corrected. “But...seriously, 
Rei. If you ever need someone to talk to, you can call me.”</p><p>“...Yeah. That goes for 
you too.”</p><p>Rei released the blonde and began to walk back towards the door when someone 
tapped at her shoulder and she heard an ‘ahem’. When she turned around, she saw Minako 
looking at her with an expectant grin.</p><p>“Don’t I get a kiss before I go?”</p><p>Rei 
almost laughed. “But if I do that, I might be spoiling you,” she countered as she wrapped 
her arms around her waist and drew them together.</p><p>“Mm...But I like being spoiled. 
Besides, you know you like it too.”</p><p>Rei smiled, but Minako didn’t see the mischievous 
glint in her dark eyes. She leaned down, but at the last possible moment she turned and gave 
her a peck on the cheek instead.</p><p>Minako opened her mouth to protest, but she was 
silenced when Rei pressed a finger against her lips.</p><p>“Next time,” She promised. And 
this time she really left, leaving Minako standing there at the doorway with a dazed 
expression on her face. It took the Venusian a moment to realize that she had been cheated 
out of a kiss.</p><p>“Rei, you jerk!” She shouted after her. “You better not forget! You 
better...”</p><p><i>...You better come back safe, okay?</i></p><p><u> (Palace Main Entrance, 
Usagi)</u></p><p>Although the others had already departed to their respective planets, Usagi 
remained where the group had last gathered. Despondently she sat on the cold steps, staring 
down at her feet while, occasionally, releasing a disheartened sigh. Her heart was still 
aching from the memory of the night before. However, despite the despair stemming from her 
past she could not bring herself to hate either of <i>them</i>: Her sister or 
Minako.</p><p><i>She truly is lucky... </i>Usagi reminisced of the other blonde. There was 
little doubt in her mind where Rei had gone to that night, and the thought of them both 
staring into each other eyes stung terribly.</p><p>“Perhaps…I am envious…” She whispered to 
herself.</p><p>Hotaru gazed at her sibling from atop of the steps. It was a sad sight, but 
she was well aware that a broken heart could not merely mend overnight.</p><p>“Usagi,” she 
called to her.</p><p>The other woman blinked, and quickly put on a smile. “Oh, Hotaru. I-I 
didn’t see you there. Did everyone leave yet?”</p><p><i>She’s still trying to 
smile?</i></p><p>“Yes, they have all left.”</p><p>“I see. Well, I hope they will be all 
right.” She rose to her feet as Hotaru descended the steps to meet her.</p><p>“I’m sure they 
will be. However…I think you should save some of that worry for us.”</p><p>“What do you 
mean?”</p><p>“I just spoke with Setsuna. She…she thinks that there may be another way to 
strengthen our forces in case some of our allies cannot pull through.”</p><p>“You mean...a 
back-up plan?”</p><p>“Yes. Usagi, do you remember the planet Earth? It is the celestial body 
that the moon orbits around. Apparently there is a group of humans living 
there.”</p><p>“Humans…?”</p><p>“Mm,” she nodded. “However, the one that rules them is not of 
a God’s rank. Do you know what that means?”</p><p><i>What it means if a planet is not ruled 
by a God?</i> Usagi tried hard to think up of an answer, but nothing was coming to 
mind.</p><p>“...No, I’m afraid I don’t.” She saw a strange emotion in Hotaru’s eyes as she 
said this. “Why?”</p><p>“Usagi... It may be possible that not all of our people have 
perished.” Her sister gasped in response. “What if it was possible, that before I…before our 
home was destroyed that a number of civilians had already moved to Earth?”</p><p>“Are you 
serious? Do you really mean that?” The hope in Usagi’s voice softened her sister’s 
expression.</p><p>“Mm. So, what do you think we should do? We cannot idly wait around for 
things to happen, right, Usagi? We must move forward, even if it pains us.” Hotaru reached 
out and held her gently by the shoulder. “Setsuna wishes for us to go and investigate. If 
her suspicions are proven to be correct then we are to request for their assistance in the 
war. We’ll go together, all right?”</p><p>…<i>Together…</i></p><p>A sincere smiled graced 
Usagi’s lips.</p><p>“Yes, let us go to Earth... together…”</p><p><u>(Venus, Space shuttle, 
Minako)</u></p><p>Surprisingly, after her reunion with her guardian, the rest of the journey 
had been made in silence. Since Sapphro had picked her up from the Moon, the man hadn’t said 
a word. She had tried to initiate a conversation several of times, especially related to 
their home during her absence, but no matter how hard she pestered him, he kept his lips 
zipped. For some reason he absolutely refused to divulge anything about Venus’s situation 
and it was starting to get on Minako’s nerves; even as the shuttle made to dock at their 
destination Sapphro continued to uphold his personal oath of silence.</p><p>“Sapphro, this 
is just silly! Why won’t you tell me anything? I’ll just find out sooner or later, you 
know!” She followed him out towards the shuttle exit. “I mean, I think I have a right to 
know.”</p><p>Both of them exited the shuttle onto the patch of ground outside. The palace 
was only a short distance away.</p><p>“Are you even listening to me-- Sapphro! 
Woah!”</p><p>He had stopped so suddenly that she almost ran into him.</p><p>“...I’m sorry. 
It’s just... I’m not very good at explaining these kinds of things, you know? I think it 
would be better if Taya filled you in on this one.”</p><p><i>Is he...?</i></p><p>“Wait, 
where are you going?”</p><p>“To get Taya!” He shouted over his shoulder. “She was ecstatic 
to hear that you were coming home! I think she might be in a meeting right now, but I bet 
she’ll be out in a blink of an eye. So stay here, all right? Don’t go wandering 
off!”</p><p>Minako reached out her hand but, no matter how much she wanted to, she couldn’t 
go after him. During their brief conversation, she had sensed it all along. Despite his 
smiles he was really heartbroken inside, and, knowing that, it broke her heart 
too.</p><p>…<i>I guess… he still hasn’t been able to forgive himself because of Eros… 
</i></p><p>She turned her attention to her surroundings. <i>This place… </i>Minako eyed the 
damaged courtyard. Although the sky above had returned to its brilliant, clear blue 
backdrop, the ground below it still bore the scars of the past battle; patches of barren 
ground were surrounded by the dead remains of charred grass, and the leftover aggregate from 
the marble statues, which still hadn’t been picked up already, remained scattered over the 
ground where they fell. As she continued to watch, she realized that each grim reminder of 
their bloody history was slowly being eroded away by the wind. Even the bloody stains that 
dyed some of the dirt unnaturally red were being blown away. The blood—the scene before the 
Venusian warped back into the battlefield of death and back.</p><p>“Ugh…” Minako brought a 
hand to her face and grimaced. <i>No… I--I can’t run away now. There’s still something that 
I have to do!</i></p><p>Rei’s face came to mind, and the nausea temporarily 
subsided.</p><p>“Hey guys, is that really--?”</p><p>“I think it is! Hey! Over here! 
HEEEEY!!!!”</p><p>Minanko instinctively pulled herself together when she spotted three 
Venusian soldiers sprinting towards her. For a moment, due to their enthusiasm, the woman 
feared that they were going to tackle her to the ground in their excitement. Or the one 
without any armor on at least.</p><p>“Captain, it really IS you!” The shortest of the three 
came to a skidding halt, barely stopping an arm’s length away from her. His blue eyes were 
shimmering with excitement as he stopped to catch his breath. “You don’t know how relieved 
we are to know that you are safe! The others--! When we found them, you weren’t there and we 
thought…”</p><p>Minako stared back in stunned silence, which quickly became awkward by what 
the man said next.</p><p>“Wait. You… you don’t remember us?” A hurt expression crossed his 
features. For a moment, Minako was worried that he was going to break down into tears. “We 
were a part of the group that you commanded during the battle. All of us here were part of 
the five man group that carried out the evacuation! But, even then... all of us didn’t make 
it. We lost two of the men when we were unexpectedly ambushed.”</p><p>“Oh. I see…” Although 
she knew she should have anticipated such a result, it still pained her to hear 
it.</p><p>“Yeah... But, hey, we’re all doing everything we can to help re-build our home! 
That’s the important thing now, right Sir? To do what we can do so that their sacrifices 
won’t in vain.”</p><p>He suddenly went quiet when he saw the thoughtful look on Minako’s 
face.</p><p>“Am I wrong?”</p><p>“No, you’re absolutely right.” Minako shook her head and 
smiled. “But, I don’t believe that I’ve ever gotten your names. May I ask who you three 
are?”</p><p>“Oh! I-I’m sorry... we should have introduced ourselves first! Stupid! Stupid!” 
He slapped himself repeatedly in the face out of sheer embarrassment.</p><p>“Umm...It’s all 
right, really. You don’t have to do that.” <i>I wish he would stop doing that...He’s 
actually making me feel bad. </i></p><p>“Yes SIR!” He saluted, and startled her for a 
second. “My name is Render, Sir. I don’t have a title or an impressive reputation to display 
but…”</p><p>As he went on into a rant about something, Minako was somewhat lost in her own 
thoughts. She still couldn’t believe it.</p><p><i>They really don’t recognize me. 
</i></p><p>“…But anyway, enough about me! Please allow me to introduce you to my comrades 
and friends. The serious guy to my nearest right is Ernest and behind him, is Dael. Dael is 
really, really, REALLY smart, but he’s not much of a talker. Actually, Ernest isn’t much of 
a talker either, but he makes up for it by being our power tank in battle. Together, the 
three of us make up squad RED!” He posed and looked at her expectantly. “It’s a great name 
isn’t it? We all pitched in and—”</p><p>“That is enough Render!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“You are 
making a fool of yourself.” Ernest interrupted before his friend could carry on. Like his 
companions, as many other Venusians, he had inherited blonde hair and blue eyes. All of 
them, however, had short hair due to military protocol.</p><p>His eyes met Minako’s. “If you 
wouldn’t mind, would you please introduce yourself as well? It is inappropriate for us, as 
soldiers, to be ignorant of the name of our captain.”</p><p>“…My name? Oh, my name! It is…” 
She began to panic. <i>Ooh, what should I say?</i> The expectant faces of admiration 
troubled her; if she revealed who she was, how would they treat her then? Would they scoff 
at her or would they panic?</p><p>“My name… is Mina.”</p><p>There was a moment of silence as 
the three men exchanged glances. Minako watched them all nervously, studying their faces for 
any possible signs of a reaction, and breathed out a sigh of relief when Render 
bellowed,</p><p>“Captain Mina, all right! You have no idea how awesome it is to meet you 
personally like this! It’s really rare to meet a superior in the academy face to 
face!”</p><p>“Indeed.” Ernest agreed. “However… I hope you don’t think of me as rude when I 
say this, but... I don’t ever recall hearing that we had a female Captain in our ranks. Many 
of the women who join the military are normally trained to become tacticians, such as our 
current substitute leader. Did you hear anything about this Dael?”</p><p>Minako froze. She 
wondered how smart this ‘Dael’ person was; Render used quite a few ‘really’s.</p><p>Render 
frowned, and shoved Ernest hard before Dael could reply. “Hey! We’re not here to interrogate 
her. Have some respect, will ya!?”</p><p>Ernest nearly fell onto Dael, who just barely moved 
out of the way in the nick of time. However, neither of the two protested against their 
friend’s word.</p><p>“I’m very sorry about that, Sir, he’s usually not like that,” Render 
apologized and bowed his head. “Please believe me when I say this, but we are very happy to 
see you. When you had suddenly disappeared without a trace, many of us were genuinely 
worried. But...the good Queen, Her Majesty, Queen Aphrodite, must be smiling upon Venus and 
brought you back to us safe and sound.” He lifted his head and shot her an apologetic look. 
“Regrettably, I wish we could welcome you back under better circumstances. However, we 
really could use your help right now.”</p><p>“...My help?”</p><p>“Yes! I know it may sound 
selfish, but we don’t know what to do anymore! Please, will you come with us to the 
city?”</p><p><i>The city…? </i>Minako remembered her friend’s words. <i>But, Sapphro told me 
to stay here. What if Taya comes looking for me and I’m missing?</i></p><p>Render sensed 
Minako’s hesitance, and in a flash he had dropped to one knee with his head bowed 
low.</p><p>“Please, I beg of you! I don’t have the time to explain everything now, but I can 
tell you on the way there. Please...! There’s no one else we can go 
to!”</p><p><i>Ah…</i></p><p>“Stand up. That’s no way for a soldier of Venus to behave.” 
Minako instructed.</p><p>The man’s head shot up. “Then, you mean…?”</p><p>“Yes. I’ll come 
with you.”</p><p>Render’s face brightened considerably. “Thank you, Sir!”</p><p><u>(Venusian 
Capital, </u><u>Cytherea</u><u>)</u></p><p>Together, with Minako in the center of the guard, 
the group ventured down the winding streets of the Venusian Capital, Cytherea. Minako was 
utterly captivated by what she saw and closely observed her people’s daily lives in complete 
fascination. The joy of witnessing the strange, yet familiar sight stirred up emotions akin 
to that of a traveler being welcomed home with open arms. And, in turn, she welcomed it back 
whole-heartedly. Her senses were all alive and tingling with newfound freedom; the urge to 
dance grew and a smile lit her face. Something so simple as taking a walk and meeting so 
many different people of various ages--her heart hadn’t felt lighter since her departure 
from the Moon.</p><p><i>This world… I’ve only seen it once before. It was after Marie 
secretly snuck me out once after I left ‘the room’. </i></p><p><i>We walked down this very 
street together in disguise. We were out all day, and we saw so many things… She was always 
smiling, and guiding me through the crowds.</i></p><p><i>I remember that, at one point 
during our walk, I was distracted by a group of children playing on the side. One of them 
was a boy about my age...I guess they were climbing around some crates and he had fallen and 
hurt his knee. Without thinking I went over to help him. I don’t really know why I did it. I 
just... did. After I helped him, he threw a piece of candy into my hands, and said, ‘Here! 
But don’t tell grandma that I gave you this, okay? She might get mad at me! ’. </i>Minako 
inwardly chuckled.</p><p><i>To say the least…after that, I was lost. I didn’t want to scream 
Marie’s name because someone might’ve recognized us, especially after all of the trouble she 
went through to make these disguises. But, I found out that I didn’t need to. She found me 
almost right away. I was so happy…</i></p><p><i>We were happy for most of the day until we 
got home. Somehow Mother knew what had happened and she scolded Marie terribly. I was so 
scared. My sister was always obedient to our Mother’s wishes, but she took all of the blame 
even though it was my idea in the first place. Even when she should have been angry at me, 
she wasn’t.</i></p><p><i>...Marie...</i></p><p><i>She always found me when I was lost. She 
always there trying to guide me; advice... love... whatever I needed, she gave without 
asking for anything in return.</i></p><p>Minako sighed.</p><p><i>I really miss 
her.</i></p><p>An elderly man mishandled a basket nearby, and the lid flew open with the 
release of doves.</p><p>“Oh!” Minako braced herself against the rush of feathers, and 
relaxed. Her companions all grinned at her surprise.</p><p>…<i>My home…</i></p><p>…<i>I want 
to show Rei this someday…<br></i><br>“It’s lively, isn’t it?’ Render commented quietly. 
“This is what we put our lives on the line to protect.”</p><p>“Mm…”</p><p>“As you probably 
already know, Sir, since the royal family’s unjustly end, we of the palace guard have been 
dispatched to help maintain the peace of the city. When word got out of Queen Aphrodite’s 
passing, and her heir, Lord Eleutherios, the capital was thrown into a state of complete 
chaos. Many of the people lashed out against one another in confusion, and as a result, many 
were hurt.”</p><p><i>That’s horrible. All of these smiling people were fighting amongst one 
another?</i> Minako almost couldn’t believe it.</p><p>“The substitute ruler, Taya, is doing 
her best to run things in Her Majesty’s place, but…unfortunately... she doesn’t quite have 
the same influence over the people. Therefore, we are still searching.”</p><p>“Searching…?” 
<i>Searching for what?</i></p><p>“Yes, someone of your rank must have heard the rumours! 
Among our people, there is a rumour that there was a survivor of the royal family. 
Apparently, our Queen had born eight children! I mean, even I didn’t know about it and I was 
a part of the guard.” He laughed nervously. Even Minako had to blink at that. “They say that 
the youngest child is still alive and out there somewhere.”</p><p><i>Ah...so this is how you 
handled my disappearance, Taya...</i></p><p>“You don’t say… Well, do you believe it?” She 
asked.</p><p>A thoughtful expression washed over his face.</p><p>“I don’t think so,” Ernest 
suddenly spoke out in a deep voice. “If there was a survivor, then why haven’t we found them 
yet? We have already searched the entire capital and there is no trace of this phantom heir! 
In fact, if you ask me...continuation of this search is just a waste of resources. But for 
argument’s sake, let’s say that kind of person actually existed… Maybe they don’t want to be 
found. Perhaps they got scared and ran away, abandoning their duty and their people. I see 
no reason to allow such a cowardly person to ascend to the throne and gain Her Majesty’s 
power. Don’t you agree…Captain?”</p><p>Minako was stunned speechless by the soldier’s words. 
More than anything she wanted to tell him that he was wrong, that what he believed wasn’t 
true-- that she hadn’t abandoned them. However, her wounded heart still struggled to find 
her identity; the person she had been born and lived as or the captain, 
and…</p><p>“…I…”</p><p>“I believe.” Another voice said quietly.</p><p>“Render?” Minako 
stared at the man. She was almost taken aback by the confidence that shone in his bright 
blue eyes.</p><p>“Surely you jest, Render!” Ernest confronted him. “You have never even 
conversed with a member of the royal family! How can you be a good judge of their 
characters?”</p><p>Render shook his head. “It’s true…that one cannot be allowed to see the 
Gods if one is not a member of the elite guard. However, our people were happy under their 
rule. Don’t you remember Lord Eleutherios, Ernest?”</p><p>He saw his friend balk at his 
words.</p><p>“Well, I do. How could I ever forget? The first time that I laid my eyes on 
him, my heart began to pound so fast! He spoke to the new recruits with such dedication, and 
kindness... that I was completely swept away in awe. When I found out that he was next in 
line to the throne, I made it my dream to be the best guard that I can be. I wanted to 
believe in them. I wanted to help protect my home. That’s why... I truly believe that the 
remaining member of the royal family, whoever he or she is, they are out there somewhere… 
alive, and well. I am positive that Her Majesty Aphrodite will bring them back to us as she 
did with our captain. Don’t you think so...Ernest?”</p><p>Ernest made a ‘hmph’ growl and 
turned his head away. But Render ignored the grouch and turned his attention to his third 
comrade.</p><p>“What about you Dael? What do you think?”</p><p>“There are often truths to 
rumours.” The shorter man simply replied. He then smiled at his friend. “However, one cannot 
rule out the faith factor.”</p><p>“That’s right!” Render laughed. “Isn’t that right Captain? 
We should just believe.”</p><p>Minako’s gaze softened. No words could entirely express the 
gratitude that she felt right then.</p><p>…<i>Thank you…</i></p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><u>(City 
Square)</u></p><p>The group pushed onwards through the crowds towards the City Square. As 
they neared the gathering place, Minako was prompted by curiosity to ask,</p><p>“Now, what 
was it that you wished for me to see?”</p><p>“We’re right here. See for 
yourself.”</p><p>Render brought them to a complete stop just outside the enormous area, and 
Minako’s eyes widened. The City Square was packed with the wounded and the sick; there were 
so many people in bandages, and almost just as many stretched out on makeshift beds in pain. 
The injured largely outnumbered the few medical specialists in the area, who were already 
being pushed to their limit. She had never quite seen anything like it.</p><p>Render scanned 
the bodies until he spotted who he was looking for.</p><p>“Grandma!” He cried and rushed 
off.</p><p><i>...Grandma?</i> Minako thought. She watched the man weave his way through the 
beds until he stopped at one in particular with an elderly woman.</p><p>“His grandmother,” 
Ernest offered to Minako’s surprise. The remaining trio watched Render drop to his knees and 
hold the woman’s wrinkled hand. “She’s all he’s got left. Sometime after the invasion, she 
fell ill.”</p><p>“Normally, there wouldn’t be any problem with treating her,” Dael added. 
“However, due to the amount of casualties we are already running low on both doctors and 
medical supplies.”</p><p>“Is that… what you came to me about?”</p><p><i>Is this what Sapphro 
couldn’t tell me about?</i></p><p>Ernest fell silent, continually staring at Render as he 
consoled his sickly grandmother, and Dael’s gaze fell.</p><p>“We understand that there may 
be nothing you can do, Sir. But…Sir?”</p><p>Minako worked her way over to where Render was 
with a determined expression upon her face.</p><p><i>Actually, there is something I can 
do…</i></p><p>Once she stopped in front of the pair, she saw him peer up at her 
questioningly.</p><p>“Trust me, okay?” She bent down to her knees and carefully took his 
grandmother’s hands into hers. The elderly woman rasped for breath, and she sweated 
profusely; the thin washcloth upon her forehead was barely containing her high 
fever.</p><p>“You’re going to feel a little strange, but it shouldn’t be uncomfortable,” she 
told the elderly woman. “All that I ask if that you bear with me for a minute.”</p><p>With 
that, Minako closed her eyes and began to concentrate.</p><p><i>I want to heal you more than 
anything. So please, get better…</i></p><p>“Captain...?” 
<i>Ah…</i></p><p><i><b>Sheeeeeeen…</b></i></p><p>A golden light wrapped itself around Minako 
and then flowed down into the elderly woman. The effect was instantaneous: The beads of 
sweat clinging onto her messed hair dried up, the redness in her face faded and her 
breathing became easier. Render couldn’t bring himself to believe the miracle that was being 
performed before his very eyes.</p><p><i>What is this power? </i></p><p>When the light 
faded, his grandmother blinked and slowly pushed herself up into a sitting position. All of 
her symptoms had been cured.</p><p>“Huh? Oh my, that’s strange...I suddenly feel so much 
better.”</p><p>Render could hardly contain his excitement any longer and gently embraced 
her. “Grandma! You’re all right! Thank Goddess!” And this time, he really did cry. “I can’t 
thank you enough. Thank you, Captain! Thank you!”</p><p>“What’s going on?” Someone 
muttered.</p><p>“Did something happen?” Another whispered.</p><p>Minako nervously glanced 
around at all the attention she was getting. The whispering had started, yet to her surprise 
she didn’t quite mind it. As far as she could tell, it wasn’t anything bad. The majority of 
it was confusion and curiosity.</p><p>A tug on her shirtsleeve drew her gaze down to see a 
little boy with a wounded puppy, who had seen the act, looking up at her 
hopefully.</p><p>“Captain…?” He timidly addressed her.</p><p>Minako reached out her hand 
towards his head and he flinched as she abruptly gave him a comforting pat.</p><p>“Of 
course,” she smiled. “Leave it to me, okay?”</p><p><i>I just want to help them. I just want 
to help my people. And this... is what I can do now. With my power, I’ll heal them… I’ll 
take away their pain…</i></p><p>“Who is she?!”</p><p>“I think someone said she was a 
aptain?”</p><p>“Captain, please help me next!”</p><p><i>But…when the time comes… How will I 
be able to tell these people, some of which who don’t even know if I 
exist…</i></p><p>…<i>who I really am?</i></p>
