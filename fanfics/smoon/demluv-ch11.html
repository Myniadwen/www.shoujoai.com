  It had already been a horrible night for 
Usagi, but now the fever reducers barely had an 
effect. A little before 3am, her breaths came in 
gasps. Rei ran down the hall to wake up Ikuko. 
  Usagi&#39;s temperature had reached 105&deg;. 
  Ikuko asked Rei to put Usagi into the tub and 
fill it with tepid water, while she called her 
friend, Mizuno Keiko, and explained what her 
pediatric office had instructed her to do. 
  Keiko was glad Ikuko called. She&#39;d had three 
major surgeries Monday, and was tired, but had 
Tuesday day off... so she didn&#39;t mind coming 
over.
  Keiko came over within 20 minutes to assess 
Usagi&#39;s condition, and determined Ikuko was 
right... it was probably pneumonia her daughter 
had, but needed chest X-rays to be sure. Keiko 
made a few phone calls to the hospital and told 
Ikuko to get Usagi dressed. She would drive them 
over to the hospital herself.
  Rei called the senshi to let them know Usagi 
hospital bound, and asked them to pray. Then she 
dressed Usagi warmly, packed her over-abundant 
stack of homework... brought to her courtesy of 
Keiko&#39;s daughter Ami, and carried an unconscious 
Usagi to the car where Keiko and Ikuko waited. 
  Dr. Mizuno showed her badge at the staff 
entrance and things happened relatively quickly 
after that.
  Rei opened her books and tried to keep her 
mind occupied while Usagi was examined and 
helped. Only Ikuko was allowed to be in with 
Usagi. Rei wished her friends were there.
  Keiko came to sit with her while they waited 
for the X-rays to happen, and Rei politely set 
the homework aside she had worked on 
half-heartedly.
  As she engaged Keiko in conversation, Rei 
discovered that all the senshi&#39;s parents gone to 
school together and had all known one another. 
  Rei asked Keiko if she remembered anything 
about her mother. 
  Keiko smiled and said her father had been so 
different back then and the life of every party. 
Her mother had been the shy type! Kenji and her 
own husband were best friends. She and Ikuko had 
done a lot of double-dating together. 
  After her husband left her, she found it too 
awkward and painful to be with Ikuko. She began 
to drift away from the very people who loved her 
most and could have helped her cope with her 
loss.
  Keiko regretted her lapse in friendship with 
Ikuko, but these days, she was too tired most of 
the time to pursue relationships. It was hard 
enough just to find the time to be with her own 
daughter, Ami. 
  Keiko admitted she was lonely, and Ikuko 
always made everyone feel good... just like her 
daughter did. She wished her friend Ikuko still 
worked in the emergency room. The whole 
department missed her cheerful efficiency. But 
Keiko understood completely why her friend had 
left. 
  The lab technician brought Keiko the X-rays at 
that moment. 
  Keiko excused herself to Rei so she could have 
a look at them and discuss the results with 
Ikuko.
  Rei was alone again and the knots in her 
stomach wouldn&#39;t go away. The waiting room was 
deafeningly quiet at that hour. She was grateful 
when Keiko came back a couple of hours later.
  Keiko smiled wearily and told her Usagi would 
be going home. 
  It had been touch and go for her friend, but 
her temperature had finally come down while they 
worked on her. 
  Rei packed her books and followed Keiko to 
where her friend was wheeled out into the foyer 
by her mom. 
  Keiko went to bring her car around and Ikuko 
went to the pharmacy. Rei stayed with Usagi and 
held her hand. 
  Rei noticed that Usagi listed to one side 
uncomfortably in the wheelchair, and knelt on 
one knee next to her groggy friend.
  &quot;Is there anything I can do to make you more 
comfortable?&quot;
  Usagi shook her head &#39;no&#39;. 
  &quot;Just don&#39;t touch my left cheek.&quot;
  Rei&#39;s eyes twinkled as she leaned over to kiss 
Usagi&#39;s face on the left side. 
  &quot;Big shot, huh?&quot;
  Usagi nodded miserably. 
  &quot;Long needle. Cold thick medicine.&quot;
  Rei squeezed her hand. 
  &quot;My poor baby... and no lollipop or balloon 
either, the cads! Can I see your band-aid? Is it 
a Sailor Moon one?&quot;
  Usagi shook her head &#39;no&#39;, and batted Rei&#39;s 
hand away.
  Rei started to chortle. 
  &quot;Oh wait, it has Sailor &#39;V&#39;, on it... right?&quot; 
Rei began to rap in Mina&#39;s voice, &quot;I Love Big 
Butts...&quot;
  Usagi glowered at her. 
  Keiko&#39;s car pulled up then, so Rei wheeled 
Usagi out, lifted her into the car carefully, 
and slid in next to her. Ikuko came shortly 
after with the new prescription Dr. Wakai and 
Dr. Mizuno had agreed upon after they conferred. 
  They rolled up to the house at 6:30am and 
Kenji met them at the door. He hadn&#39;t really 
been able to sleep after Ikuko told him Usagi 
needed to go to the hospital. 
  Rei put Usagi back into her bed... the girl 
had been out cold the whole way home, and still 
was. Rei was terrified. 
  Ikuko went into the kitchen to make up some 
bags of ice, and to comfort her distraught 
husband. 
  Keiko had followed Rei upstairs.    
  Ikuko finished, and within seconds was 
upstairs. She teleported over to her daughter&#39;s 
bedside. Ikuko and Usagi were incredibly alike 
personality-wise, Rei noted. Usagi had inherited 
Kenji&#39;s gift for writing, and perhaps his 
height, and that was about it. 
  Rei smiled.
  Keiko smiled at her old friend, too. She stood 
to take her leave. 
   &quot;Ikuko-chan, if this high fever persists for 
more than a day after she takes this 
prescription, or she starts to vomit from its 
strength, call me. We&#39;ll have to admit her into 
the hospital. It was just too crowded to keep 
Usagi there tonight, or they would have let her 
stay. She&#39;s probably better off here at home in 
recovery, though, instead of a germ factory like 
the hospital.&quot; 
  Keiko put a hand on Rei&#39;s shoulder and 
squeezed it. 
  &quot;Rei, your mother would be so proud of you. I 
think you&#39;ve grown into the woman she always 
wanted you to be. Wouldn&#39;t you agree, Ikuko?&quot;
  Ikuko&#39;s eyes watered for a moment. 
  &quot;Yes, Yuri definitely would have been proud of 
you, Rei. She loved you more than life itself. 
She and the Kino&#39;s are deeply missed.&quot;
  Rei beamed with happiness.
  Ikuko got up and hugged Keiko.
  &quot;Thank you so much for everything you&#39;ve done 
for Usagi tonight. I owe her life to you! Please 
don&#39;t be a stranger, Keiko. I miss our 
friendship terribly... I get lonely, too. Kenji 
is great, but I miss my girl-talk!&quot;
  Keiko smiled a little at that.
  &quot;I&#39;m glad I had the day off and could help 
your daughter. Let&#39;s see,&quot; Keiko began while she 
foraged through her purse, &quot;I think I can fit 
you into my schedule somewhere.&quot; Keiko whipped 
out her pocket calendar and started to flip 
through the pages. 
  Ikuko sighed.
  Keiko looked up and laughed at her.
  &quot;Gotcha!&quot; She put her calendar away. 
  &quot;You know, you can come back to work any 
time... we could really use your talent. We 
would see a whole lot more of each other if you 
did, old friend.&quot;
  Ikuko gave a wry expression and laughed. 
  &quot;This is emotional blackmail! I&#39;ll think about 
it, Keiko-chan. 
  Right now I&#39;m needed here, more. My little 
girl is very sick with pneumonia, and I have the 
privilege to stay home and take care of her. It 
feels good. I&#39;ll call you the minute I change my 
mind, though. 
  On your next day off, call me, and we&#39;ll go 
hang out at Azabu Springs, ok?&quot;
  Keiko squeezed Ikuko&#39;s hand.
  &quot;Its a date. I&#39;m going home to sleep, then 
spend some time with Ami. I&#39;ll see myself out... 
I hope Usagi recovers quickly.&quot; 
 
                   * * *                         
  Usagi&#39;s high fever lasted another anxious day. 
It finally came down to 102&deg;, and hovered there 
for the rest of the week. 
  Usagi&#39;s room resembled a small flower shop by 
then, and Rei read every get well card before 
she taped them to the wall near Usagi&#39;s bed 
where she could see them. Rei thought Usagi must 
have been the most popular girl in Juuban. 
  Ikuko stuck to her guns, though, and only 
allowed one of Usagi&#39;s closest friends to see 
her... one time per day. So all the senshi had 
taken turns, one at a time, feeding the 
ginsuishou their energy and watching over their 
princess. 
  Rei spent all the spare time she had with 
Usagi and sat up with her nights and shared her 
energy.
  The pneumonia was very persistent, and the 
high fever induced deliriums had been especially 
hard on Rei. Rei was now privy to every fear, 
pain endured, and every nightmare. 
  She also understood how much Usagi loved 
Mamoru, and part of her felt guilty about her 
behavior towards her prince. She had loved him, 
too, but realized after awhile they were too 
much alike. Rei&#39;s other part wanted desperately 
to make Mamoru hurt the way he had hurt Usagi, 
brother or not. 
  She learned through delirious utterances how 
all the horror they had faced as senshi had 
really affected her. Usagi had always known that 
ultimately it would be up to her alone to face 
Chaos&#39; demons as the antithesis. She had 
approached each fate graciously and 
courageously, despite her fear. Usagi genuinely
revered life and loved souls... especially those
of her senshi. 
  Usagi&#39;s encounter with Sailor Cosmos, the 
guardian senshi of senshi star seeds... had 
changed her. Rei knew she was, and deserved to 
be, a universal heroine. Rei&#39;s love and respect 
for their indomitable leader was immeasurable. 
  By the weekend, Usagi&#39;s deliriums had stopped. 
Usagi was afforded more restful sleeps, and 
longer sessions of coherent conversation. 
  Rei had taken advantage of these opportunities 
to really get some backlogged schoolwork done. 
When she asked Usagi if she had .7mm pencil 
refills, Usagi flipped a careless hand at her 
desktop drawer. What Rei saw among the 
incredible clutter shocked her. 
  Usagi coughed, and Rei came over to her 
friend, and rubbed her upper chest for seemingly 
the hundredth time. When Usagi was better, Rei 
asked if she could look at the sketchbooks. 
  Usagi hesitated, then, nodded her assent. 
  Rei carefully removed a thick tome. She peeked 
behind the book and reached for the rumpled 
masses of paper smashed against the back of the 
drawer. Most of them were old unfinished 
homework papers with scads of doodles 
embroidered around the edges. 
  Rei un-crumpled them and held them up to Usagi 
accusingly.
  Usagi grinned guiltily. 
  &quot;I wondered where all my homework went!&quot;
  &quot;Usa, you weren&#39;t going to turn these in were 
you?&quot; Rei asked, shocked.
  &quot;Of course I was! Oh, Rei, I&#39;ll never fit into 
your neat, tidy little square world! I think the 
bulk of my teachers really appreciated my 
deviant behavior just to relieve their boredom.&quot; 
Usagi exclaimed.
  Rei normally would have snapped at her, but 
realized Usagi had merely suggested she lived a 
very structured life. Usagi was anything but. 
  Rei smiled a little. 
  &quot;I think maybe we need each other to be the 
way we are.&quot; 
  Rei opened the art book and was blown away. 
She flipped through page after page of 
recognizable manga drawings and story lines 
scribbled among the artwork. Rei turned to talk 
to Usagi, but the girl had fallen into an 
exhausted sleep. 
  Rei sighed, then, began to tidy the drawer in 
earnest. She found more portfolios and tomes in 
the top left hand drawer of the desk. Rei 
decided to put the latest effort in the desktop 
drawer and tidied up the art supplies in it. The 
rest went back into the other drawer by date. 
The thickest one represented her 13th and 14th 
years... obviously pre-senshi. 
  Rei found a padded manila envelope. Curious, 
she peeked inside and found a thick manga, an 
art book, and some paperwork. Rei slid the 
contents out and gasped. The manga had been one 
of her favorites when she was 14, and the art 
book was beautiful. No wonder Usagi had smiled 
when Rei had said that was the one manga Usagi 
could not borrow! She had seen the art book, 
too, but couldn&#39;t afford it. 
  The paperwork was from the publisher and 
offered congratulations to Tsukino Usagi as the 
author under the pen name of &#39;Mirai Hikaru&#39;. 
Rei&#39;s face flushed at the amount of money 
awarded her for proceeds. The paperwork also 
named the Hikawa Jinja for a percentage of all 
the royalties. 
  &#39;Harebrained Usagi&#39; was a freaking genius! At 
14 Usagi had published two books and would 
probably make enough money to pay for as much 
college as she could stomach. She had taken care 
of Grandpa and her for four years. Rei never 
knew, and guiltily didn&#39;t think she was supposed 
to. All donations to the shrine were generally 
anonymous, no matter where it came from. 
  Usagi had seen the shrine on a daily basis and 
knew it needed repairs. She also knew Grandpa 
couldn&#39;t afford them. Rei blinked the tears away 
that suddenly blinded her.
  &quot;You have always been my Shugotenshi, haven&#39;t 
you?&quot; Rei whispered.
  The last two drawers contained scores of music 
composition and lyrics. Usagi had a brilliant 
unfettered mind. 
  She had graduated with honors from high 
school, as had all the senshi... due mostly to 
Ami&#39;s tutelage over the years. Usagi had 
received a music scholarship she didn&#39;t need. 
Rei had a music scholarship as well. 
  When Rei finished, she cleaned the rest of the 
room because she was on a roll. Nothing else 
there was notable, except an ancient metal box 
that frankly looked Silver Millennium. There was 
Usagi&#39;s array of guitars on stands with not a 
speck of dust on them. They were her babies. 
  Rei admired each one. She had a natural ash 
&#39;52 Fender Telecaster six-string, an FP-400SC 
Takamine twelve-string electro-acoustic, and a 
Natural Gibson Thunderbird bass. Rei wanted to 
set the old nylon six-string Kohno upright next 
to the wall near the others, but couldn&#39;t bring 
herself to take it out of the case.
  She touched it lightly with her fingertips. 
The last time she saw it was when she was five 
and her mother had shown her how to hold it. She 
shut the case and locked it. It would look out 
of place, anyway, she thought with a lump in her 
throat. 
  Somehow, with Usagi, it did seem to fit in. 
All her instruments were a natural color; she 
didn&#39;t do &#39;flashy&#39;. She made her statements with 
music. Rei didn&#39;t think there was anybody&#39;s 
guitar riff Usagi couldn&#39;t play. Rei was glad 
her Mother&#39;s guitar had found it&#39;s way into the 
hands of such a gifted artist, who could 
actually read, compose, play, and sing... music.
  Usagi had a clutter of electronic equipment 
connected by snarls of cables. Rei did notice 
with amusement that the cables were either 
labeled or color coded. To one piece of 
equipment, which had a lot of knobs and slides 
on it, she had taped a skull and cross bones to 
the power switch. Usagi was so kawaii! 
  Rei made a list of the cable connections, and 
arranged everything neatly. She was careful not 
to mess up any of the current settings on the 
equipment as she re-connected everything neatly.  
  Rei was glad she had an uncomplicated piano to 
play. Her digital piano only needed to be 
plugged in, which she did after she put the 
computer keyboard on top of the monitor to make 
room for it. 
  Rei gently brushed the damp bangs from Usagi&#39;s 
forehead and watched as she slept for a few 
minutes. She was out cold. 
  Rei donned a pair of padded headphones and 
happily began to compose... on her piano.
