&quot;Hey, Haruka-kun, what&#39;s the deal? No pretty woman on your arm to 
celebrate another win?&quot; The voice of Yamada Ichiro, Haruka&#39;s closest 
rival in the off-road motocross championships cut through the crowded 
room after another race.

A mud covered competitor who had come in seventh laughed heartily and 
shot a smile in Haruka&#39;s direction. &quot;No joke, Tenoh. What happened to 
that hot brunette that you&#39;ve been with the past few weeks?&quot;

That started an uproar among the other guys and Haruka simply quietly 
evaded answering. &quot;Ah.&quot; She replied, non-pulsed. Sometimes she didn&#39;t 
know what outcome would be worse with these men, for them to realize 
that she was a woman, or for them to realize that she was a woman who 
liked women.

At least they weren&#39;t being sore losers, quite the contrary, her fellow 
racers either clamored to befriend her, or were jealous of her skill and 
popularity. &#39;What a waste of time and emotion.&#39; She considered sourly.

Truth be told, Haruka was surprised that even her superficial 
competitors had remembered the last girl her sponsor had thrown on her 
arm. She searched her memories and could at least confirm that she had 
indeed been a brunette. Arisa. A glance at a nearby tabloid confirmed 
the woman&#39;s name and Haruka shrugged apathetically.

Just another nameless face in the long run, an entirely beautiful, yet 
forgettable supermodel paired with her to attract the media by her 
sponsors in order to uphold her &#39;dangerous playboy&#39; persona. Not that 
she minded having such a beautiful woman on her arm, but the shallow 
women thrown at her simply didn&#39;t interest her.

Glancing back at the tabloid, Haruka noticed that the picture next to 
the one of Arisa showed herself standing with a blonde woman this time, 
the caption reading, &#39;Tenoh, a cheater?&#39; Haruka rolled her eyes. She&#39;d 
barely even remembered seeing that girl before. She flipped over the 
tabloid to hide the offending article from view.

In the end, all of the beautiful women she&#39;d been paired with since 
making it big in the motorsports arena, be it car racing, motorcycle 
racing, or dirtbike racing, none of them had attracted her. Each one the 
same cookie cutter replica of the one before her, a slim figured, drop 
dead gorgeous older woman with the wit and personality of a potato chip, 
none had every managed to catch Haruka&#39;s attention.

No one could hold her attention, except for her...

Haruka frowned, her hazel eyes turning a stormy gray. She refused to 
even consider that her emotions for that confusing aqua haired girl were 
anything other than fear and repulsion, regardless of the previous 
&#39;dream&#39; she&#39;d experienced that had showcased this Michiru as someone 
wholly different than the stoic Sailor Neptune that came to take more 
than Haruka could rightfully give.

Suddenly, Haruka sensed the quietness of the room and realized that the 
others had cleared the lounge, returning to whatever passed for lives 
for each of them. She sighed loudly, tired from the long race, and 
pulled at the velcro closure around the neck of her protective gear, 
exposing the curve of her slender neck.

When a flash of aqua and cobalt caught her attention, her eyes 
immediately found something more than just her own reflection in the 
mirror.

flashback

&quot;You&#39;re so tense.&quot; The aqua haired woman said quietly, meeting her 
partner&#39;s hazel eyes in the reflection of the mirror as her fingers 
began working the soreness of Haruka&#39;s back.

&quot;Michiru.&quot; Haruka sighed her lover&#39;s name and leaned back into her 
touch.

The cobalt eyed temptress smiled mischievously and worked her partner&#39;s 
sore muscles with the deft precision of violinist&#39;s fingers, her motions 
becoming the ebb and flow of the ocean&#39;s waves across her lover&#39;s skin. 
A rush of power coursed through Michiru to see the tough, unyielding 
tomboy before her bend to her supple touch, and as she worked a 
particularly tense knot in Haruka&#39;s back, Michiru&#39;s lips found the edge 
of her lover&#39;s ear.

&quot;I take it that the powers that be were rather upset when they found 
that you&#39;d returned from your mission early without notifying anyone?&quot; 
She asked the simple question quietly but with a depth to her voice that 
caused the woman under her fingers to shudder involuntarily.

&quot;Ah.&quot; Haruka finally replied, attempting to regain some amount of 
control of her body under Michiru&#39;s mercilessly taunting touch. &quot;I was 
only reprimanded with a few extra sets of physical training for my 
delinquent behavior.&quot;

Michiru cocked an eyebrow at her macho partner and retracted her lips 
from the edge of Haruka&#39;s ear, to her lover&#39;s obvious displeasure. &quot;Ara? 
Only that?&quot; she mocked lightly, a playful expression on her features.

&quot;Oh, and I suspect that you think you won&#39;t get in trouble too? That 
they won&#39;t figure out that it was you that I came back for? Don&#39;t forget 
that you conspired with this delinquent.&quot; Haruka said haughtily, 
challenging Michiru&#39;s gaze in the mirror.

A seductive smile spread across Michiru&#39;s lips and she rested her hands 
on Haruka&#39;s shoulders. &quot;Conspired with a delinquent? Is that what we 
did?&quot;

Haruka grinned confidently. As of three days ago, she now belonged to 
Michiru, and Michiru to herself, and she would have given anything in 
the solar system she was bound to protect to simply do it all over 
again. Haruka laced Michiru&#39;s fingers in her own and spun her lover 
around to her front, accommodating Michiru with her lap.

A blush crawled up the senshi of the sea&#39;s cheeks. Her forwardness 
slightly diminished once finding herself straddling her partner&#39;s 
thighs, she finally trusted her weight to Haruka&#39;s slim yet strong 
frame. Every touch and whisper from her lover still so new as to send a 
chill of joy and sheer exhilaration up her spine, Michiru let out a gasp 
as Haruka&#39;s lips found the tender skin of her neck this time.

Introducing Michiru to a new form of turnabout, Haruka&#39;s fingers reached 
into her lover&#39;s aqua hair and gently eased out the pin that held it 
bound, releasing her shoulder length curls in a sensual wave.

In a barely controlled frenzy that fueled them both, Haruka found the 
clasp to Michiru&#39;s dress, and with a boundless desire to re-explore her 
lover&#39;s body, slid its thin straps from her shoulders.

/flashback

The powerful emotions becoming too much for her overloaded mind, Haruka 
shook herself from her daydream. A heavy, panting breath and a fresh 
sheen of sweat across her body, the blonde realized that she had once 
again had a vision of Michiru, of Sailor Neptune, and she now understood 
a new layer of their relationship. They had been partners on the 
battlefield, friends as civilians, and also... lovers.

But to admit to the existence of their relationship at all would be to 
admit that these visions that had come unbidden into her mind were not 
merely dreams, but memories of a previous life. It would mean that she 
would have to admit to the obligations of not only a duty that awaited 
her in this life, but also a certain aqua haired woman that brought that 
destiny. If that were the case, would that cobalt eyed woman want her in 
this life as she had in their last? A feeling of completion foreign to 
her constantly lonely mood washed over her...

In a sudden wave of confusion, fear and frustration, Haruka&#39;s fist 
shattered the mirror before her and she ran from the lounge, small drops 
of her blood leaving a mournful trail of her escape.

----------

Her transformation from a bloodied Sailor Neptune back to her pristine 
civilian form hadn&#39;t even slowed Michiru down as she ran through the 
tree lined suburban streets.

In her quest to find Haruka again, she found that it hadn&#39;t been 
difficult to find a schedule of the blonde&#39;s races online, she certainly 
had enough fan pages and official pages on the net. Michiru had been on 
her way to the motor cross arena when she had once again encountered 
youma, making it obvious that the monsters that heralded the Silence had 
reached even the outskirts of Tokyo. A bitter frown marred her features 
at the memory of the ugly creatures. This time, two of them had 
attacked.

Fueled by her intuitive instinct, Michiru had had to delay her quest to 
find Haruka once being forced to fight as Sailor Neptune. She had 
managed to dispose of the youma, but had found that her latest battle 
had been more difficult to win than her first. The creatures had gotten 
stronger and had grown larger in numbers. The revelation left Michiru 
with the uneasy knowledge that she would need the help of Uranus soon 
and feared her current solitary role in the battle against the silence 
without her partner by her side.

But at the moment with the threat of the youma gone, thoughts of duty 
were put on hold. She was late for a rather unscheduled meeting to which 
she assumed Pluto would be very upset, were she to know of its nature. 
At the moment, even the thought of awakening Uranus was not at the 
forefront of Michiru&#39;s mind. Instead, the memory of her confession to 
the Haruka of her past life encouraging her, she hoped to wake the 
Haruka of the present first. Michiru desperately needed to remind Haruka 
of who she once was, who she could become once again if only Haruka 
would let her in.

&#39;The real Haruka is in there, hiding behind those frightened hazel eyes. 
I know it.&#39; Michiru repeated the phrase like a mantra.

She ran down the streets, dodging the sea of people that slowly flowed 
towards her, heading for the bus stops. Hearing bits and pieces of 
others&#39; conversations, she learned that Haruka had won another race. 
Michiru realized that she had missed the end of the race, but she hoped 
she hadn&#39;t missed the blonde racer. She realized with a slight, hopeless 
chuckle that she didn&#39;t even know what motor cross was, but considering 
the grubby attire of its fans, she concluded it was some kind of off 
road motorcycle race.

Nonetheless, such a trivial thought was useless. All that mattered was 
that she find this woman linked to her past life. She had to find 
Haruka, understand why she had so drastically changed from the lover she 
once was, and understand why she had yet to awaken as Uranus, why her 
natural carefree and passionate personality had changed so drastically.

A blush crawled up Michiru&#39;s cheeks as the memories of her past life 
resurfaced. She didn&#39;t know how she&#39;d approach the stoic woman, or even 
what she&#39;d say, but somehow, she knew she had to make Haruka understand 
that she needed Haruka as much as Haruka needed her.

Her cobalt eyes lit up when she finally saw the dirt track ahead of her, 
a squiggly path with hairpin turns, tall hills, humps and obstacles. She 
gazed in awe for a moment, considering the reflexes that must be needed 
to drive a dirtbike over such terrain, but she also knew it was 
naturally something that Haruka could do with ease.

Motion to her right caught Michiru&#39;s eyes and she saw a number of men 
wearing protective gear covered in mud and carrying helmets under their 
arms. She realized that they had been competitors in the race and hoped 
they would know where to find Haruka. She headed towards them, but 
before she could even speak, she was stopped by a loud, low whistle 
aimed in her direction.

&quot;Hey there, hot stuff.&quot; One of the men with short black hair cat-called. 
&quot;Looking for some fun?&quot;

Michiru&#39;s eyes narrowed and turned icy. What she wouldn&#39;t have given to 
use Neptune&#39;s powers and give those hormone laden men a cold shower... 
&quot;I&#39;m looking for Tenoh Haruka.&quot; She replied coldly, yet confidently, her 
icy voice stamping out the hopes of the men.

&quot;Keh.&quot; The black haired man snorted, his eyebrows furrowed in disgust. 
&quot;That jerk gets all the women.&quot; He noticed the insisting features of the 
aqua haired woman standing defiantly in front of him before finally 
giving in. &quot;He&#39;s in there.&quot; He said dismissively with a point of his 
thumb to the building they had exited.

Not even affording them a nod, Michiru sauntered away before dashing 
towards the small building, her heart pounding in her chest with 
anticipation. The door was almost within her reach when she was suddenly 
grabbed by the wrist and pulled back behind a row of evergreens.

Michiru barely had the time to stifle her scream, fearing one of the men 
had come back to try his luck again, when she recognized the scolding 
garnet eyes of her would be assailant.

&quot;Pluto!&quot; Michiru exclaimed and then took a second glance, noting the 
rather demure burgundy power suit the tall woman wore. &quot;Setsuna...&quot; 
Michiru corrected, averting her eyes, unable to meet her friend&#39;s look 
of disappointment. She had betrayed Setsuna&#39;s trust by pursuing Haruka 
before the time senshi had deemed she was ready.

At that moment, the sound of a door slamming caught Setsuna and 
Michiru&#39;s attention and through the dense foliage of the pines, exiting 
the building, they saw an angry Haruka emerge. Setsuna&#39;s grip around her 
friend&#39;s wrist tightened as Michiru&#39;s pupils dilated on the racer&#39;s 
form. Every fiber of her being longed to run to the blonde and sooth her 
unease, but she had to settle with simply trying to ascertain the reason 
for her anger. Her eyes narrowed as Haruka secured her helmet and 
mounted her bike.

&#39;Her hands are bleeding.&#39; Michiru realized, puzzled at the drops of 
blood that fell from tightly balled fists.

As quickly as she had emerged, Haruka was gone, leaving only a cloud of 
dust and the fading sound of her bike&#39;s engine in her wake.

The threat of an untimely meeting having passed, Setsuna finally 
released her grip around Michiru&#39;s wrist. &quot;I told you she&#39;s not ready to 
be awakened yet.&quot; She said as calmly and consolingly as possibly.

Michiru&#39;s eyes shone with defiance. &quot;I know, but-&quot;

&quot;But nothing, Michiru, she&#39;s not ready to see you yet! Do you want to 
push her even further away?&quot; Setsuna interrupted. She sighed when her 
friend&#39;s determined frown fell into a hopelessly lost expression.

Quietly, Setsuna led the two of them to a bench, sure that Michiru was 
unaware that she was even walking. She silently cursed the fates that 
had made the reunion between Haruka and Michiru so difficult on each 
other.

&quot;Listen, Michiru, Haruka hasn&#39;t been as receptive to all the memories 
and emotions you&#39;ve experienced. You have to understand that if she sees 
you right now, she&#39;ll likely feel only fear and anger.&quot; Setsuna 
explained calmly.

Michiru&#39;s quiet voice threatened to break. &quot;But why Setsuna? What about 
me scares her? Why can&#39;t I make her see what I remember? Why can&#39;t I 
help her find the self she no longer is?&quot;

Setsuna sighed, her eyes garnet eyes trailing to the horizon. The 
sapphire haired woman considered her friend sadly. She understood 
Michiru&#39;s urgency, but feared that the barriers that protected Haruka&#39;s 
true personality were too strong, too well built. It was too dangerous 
to try to break them down yet.

Michiru had to know that which had caused Haruka to build those walls in 
the first place. &quot;You haven&#39;t remembered all of your memories of your 
past life yet, have you, Michiru?&quot;

&quot;All of them?&quot; Michiru asked slowly, suddenly realizing that the 
beautiful harmony that had been her previous existence would have had to 
come to an end eventually.

Setsuna nodded sadly. &quot;Have you seen the end of the Silver Millennium 
through your eyes? Have you seen that which contributes to Haruka&#39;s fear 
and anger?&quot;

Michiru gasped as the memories flooded her.

flashback

The sounds of the ball drifted to their ears. Light giggles and 
conversations floated aimlessly amongst the symphony of instruments that 
played joyously in celebration of Princess Serenity&#39;s eighteenth 
birthday. Of course, the outer senshi had been invited, but they had 
denied the opportunity to attend in favor of guarding the event, 
regardless of the fact that there was no supposed threat to it. Sailor 
Uranus eyed her partner with concern. Neptune was nervous. She didn&#39;t 
need to be as intuitive as her other half to understand that and so her 
white gloved hand reached out for her smaller lover&#39;s to give it a 
gentle, reassuring squeeze.

&quot;Do you wish we could have gone to the ball?&quot; Neptune asked, yet her 
question was empty, meant only to fill the silence.

Uranus chuckled lightly, suggestively. &quot;I&#39;d rather be anywhere as long 
as it was off duty and with you. But... we have our mission to think of. 
It would have been fun, though. With our separate missions, it&#39;s been so 
long since we&#39;ve seen the inner senshi and our Princess.&quot;

&quot;I miss Queen Serenity, too.&quot; Neptune admitted. &quot;We&#39;ve been so busy of 
late, and I know she&#39;s as worried as we have been. Even though we have 
no clue to this nameless threat that we fear looms, no target beyond our 
unease, she needs to maintain a strong front for her people.&quot; The sound 
of a festive firework being launched screamed through the air. 
Momentarily its hues of reds and oranges claimed precedence of the night 
sky, but its bright colors did nothing to relieve the pensive mood of 
the senshi of the ocean.

Uranus agreed with her partner&#39;s sentiment, but frowned, unhappy that 
Neptune was so melancholy. It would do no good to brood over an 
answerless question. &quot;Hotaru was alright when you left her?&quot; She asked, 
changing the subject and hoping that idle conversation would ease her.

The aqua haired woman nodded, though her eyes were distant. &quot;She really 
wasn&#39;t feeling well though. The growth spurts are very painful.&quot;

The blonde frowned as she considered their adopted daughter. Hotaru had 
aged from a toddler to the physical appearance of fourteen in the short 
year that she&#39;d been with them. Small manifestations of the knowledge 
and powers of Sailor Saturn had occurred in her within the last few 
weeks although there were still no detectable enemies outside their 
borders that should have triggered Saturn&#39;s awakening. The outer senshi 
had been on edge. Even the inner senshi had finally been notified of the 
situation and with the deteriorating relationship between Earth and the 
Moon, everyone had been cautious and careful of late.

Neptune and Uranus turned a corner, patrolling the exterior regions of 
the busy Moon Palace, weary eyes on the lookout for suspicious activity. 
A sudden commotion caught their attention and they straightened into 
battle ready positions as a tuxedo-clad man came briskly jogging up the 
daunting stairs to the palace, flustered from the undertaking in his 
formal ware. The senshi relaxed as they noted the presence of the Earth 
Prince, Endymion, merely arriving late to pay homage to Princess 
Serenity. Though Earthlings had been banned from the Moon due to recent 
uprising caused by jealousy of the mortals from the blue planet, the 
senshi trusted the Earth Prince and they knew Endymion&#39;s love for young 
Serenity was fierce. Besides, the human knew well enough to hide his 
identity while in the Moon Palace, for the Queen and her guards would 
surely dispose of him were he to be caught.

Dismissing the Earthling, Uranus continued forward but then stopped when 
she realized that her partner was not at her side. She glanced back at 
her lover who was still frozen in place while her cobalt eyes followed 
Endymion as he entered the main ballroom.

&quot;Neptune?&quot; Uranus asked gently with kidding shock in her voice. &quot;Don&#39;t 
tell me you&#39;ve suddenly found an interest in men?&quot;

A trace of a smile reached Neptune&#39;s lips and finally, she shook her 
head and followed after her partner, slipping an arm through Uranus&#39; own 
for support and solace as she questioned her sudden unease.

&quot;Ne, have you seen Pluto lately?&quot; The senshi of the wind asked, trying 
to coax her partner back from the introverted world in which she had 
retreated.

The senshi of the ocean shook her head, forcing herself to concentrate 
on Uranus. &quot;No. It seems she&#39;s been busy lately. I&#39;d guess she&#39;s at her 
post.&quot;

&quot;The Time Gate?&quot; Uranus asked suspiciously.

Neptune nodded deftly. &quot;I wonder if she&#39;s pinpointed the disturbance we 
feel.&quot; She locked eyes with her partner. &quot;The sea is restless.&quot;

Uranus frowned, wanting desperately to ease her partner, to replace the 
haunted look in her eyes with happiness, with passion... &quot;Nonsense, 
Neptune. Remember? We haven&#39;t detected even the smallest amount of 
negative energy outside our solar system that would have triggered 
Saturn&#39;s awakening. Although I&#39;m glad she&#39;s with us, Hotaru having been 
born at all has to be some kind of... fluke!&quot;

The aqua haired senshi wanted to smile at her partner&#39;s childishly 
simple idea, but suddenly a chill ran down her spine. &quot;Uranus, if we 
can&#39;t detect anything outside, then what if it&#39;s something inside the 
solar system that triggered Saturn&#39;s birth? The inner senshi may not 
have known to look for it.&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re thinking about Earth again, aren&#39;t you?&quot; Uranus asked coldly, 
hating that planet for the attention her partner gave it. &quot;Well stop it, 
it&#39;s not our job. It&#39;s the responsibility of the inner senshi to 
negotiate threats inside the solar system. Besides, there couldn&#39;t be 
anything from Earth powerful enough to have woken Sailor Saturn, not 
even Queen Beryl herself! Right?&quot;

Uranus&#39; bravado diminished somewhat when she received no response or 
even eye contact from her partner. Could Neptune really believe that the 
uprising on Earth was connected to Saturn&#39;s awakening? The blonde senshi 
stiffened at such a thought, but refused to surrender to her fears. Her 
desire to ease her partner was stronger.

With a quick movement, she grabbed Neptune by the wrist and spun her 
into her taller body, wrapping her arms around the smaller woman&#39;s 
waist. &quot;I don&#39;t care what happens, Michiru, so long as I&#39;m with you.&quot; 
Her words were light and husky, attempting to draw her partner away from 
her worries as she nuzzled her neck.

&quot;Maa...&quot; Neptune sighed, both in surprise at her partner&#39;s actions that 
threatened to derail her train of thought and the use of her civilian 
name. She caught the senshi of the wind&#39;s eyes with her own and was 
immediately eased by the comfort she found in them. With a soft sigh, 
she surrendered to Uranus&#39; ministrations and captured her lips with her 
own. If planet Earth did pose a threat, it was currently the furthest 
thing from Neptune&#39;s mind as another barrage of fireworks shot across 
the sky.

Slowly, the pair backed against a wall, their forms disappearing into 
the shadows of the night as their actions became more brazen, more 
intimate. A delicious smile tugged at Neptune&#39;s lips as Uranus&#39; hands 
slid sensuously down her back to cup her rear, causing the aqua haired 
woman to hike a leg up in response. As she felt her partner&#39;s lips on 
her neck and her warm breath in her ear, delightful chills ran down her 
spine as she allowed Uranus to support her weight.

As much as she wanted to continue, Neptune knew they had a duty to 
perform and if she didn&#39;t rein her lover in now, there would be no 
stopping her. Standing on her tiptoes, the senshi of the ocean reached 
her partner&#39;s ear. &quot;Shhh. Stop now.&quot; She whispered hotly, belying her 
true desires.

Uranus slowed her passionate ministrations but refused to stop 
completely. The taller woman&#39;s hands still caressed her lover&#39;s curves 
gently as her head bent to the crook of Neptune&#39;s neck. &quot;I know.&quot; She 
responded in disappointed understanding, her voice breaking from the 
effort to control her passion.

Slowly, in tune to the sonata that carried on the wind from the 
ballroom, the couple swayed back and forth, allowing the music to calm 
them. Finally, the gentle notes acted as a desperately needed anchor and 
the senshi of the wind&#39;s hands settled on Neptune&#39;s waist and the senshi 
of the ocean&#39;s lips left the warm skin of her partner&#39;s neck. Each 
sighed deeply, their passions quieted for a moment as they danced 
together in the slow music.

That was when a single scream ripped through the courtyard below them.

Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus broke away from each other, looking 
down the long drop to the courtyard below where the scream was heard, 
but nothing of interest could be seen. It was then that Neptune looked 
up, high into the sky and she uttered a single, panicked gasp.

On the white horizon of the moonscape approached Earth&#39;s Queen Beryl, 
her four generals and a mass of humans, their eyes glazed and unthinking 
as they charged forward, slaughtering all in their path. But behind them 
all hung a hideous creature of death and destruction, its shadowed 
silhouette reaching out with clawed fingers and sharp teeth, an unnamed 
terror of monumental power. This hellish figure was alive, a Medusa of 
enormous proportion, a menacing creature that threatened to set the sky 
itself on fire.

Their enemy had been revealed. And it came from the Earth.

The Moon Kingdom, the Silver Millennium, their Queen and Princess, their 
very lives... all they had ever known lay under attack.

Wordlessly, Neptune and Uranus leapt down into the courtyard, springing 
on their toes and acquiring defensive battle positions as they prepared 
to meet the threat. As commoners of the Moon Kingdom trampled past them, 
eager to escape the coming terror, the two outer senshi held their 
ground, and as the first wave of unthinking humans crashed into them, 
the first line of the new enemy was leveled by their powerful attacks.

&quot;Deep Submerge!&quot;

&quot;World Shaking!&quot;

The voices of the two women cried out above the massacre as their 
elemental attacks thinned the ranks of the approaching onslaught. 
Talismans were quickly called upon and the sound of a single blade 
slicing through the air overpowered even the fireworks that crashed in 
the sky above, those in the palace still unaware of the slaughter 
occurring below them.

Their senshi training had been intense, yet nothing could have prepared 
Neptune and Uranus for the sudden ambush of the unnamed force from 
Earth. In the confusion of the battlefield, Queen Beryl and the Earth 
generals slipped around them, too far away for even their long range 
attacks to reach them. Helpless to do anything else, the two outer 
senshi blindly fought the Earth humans, though they knew the attempt to 
be futile.

&quot;Uranus, the source of their strength is that beast in the sky!&quot; 
Neptune&#39;s voice carried on the wind to her partner as the senshi of the 
ocean balanced fighting the surge of opponents while utilizing her 
mirror to show her the truth of the battle.

Uranus let go a brutal scream as she tore through the torsos of five men 
with a single blow of her Space Sword. A well placed elemental attack 
cleared the area around herself and her partner momentarily. &quot;A whole 
lot of good that does us! These men are brainwashed, can you see it in 
their eyes? They&#39;re shielding her! There&#39;s no chance that we&#39;ll be able 
to reach that monster up there!&quot;

The two senshi slouched slightly, using each other&#39;s backs for support 
as they attempted to catch their breath. The time they had been granted 
was minimal, and before they were ready, a new wave of humans had surged 
forward, &quot;Where&#39;s Pluto when you need her?&quot; Uranus barked as she readied 
another attack for the soldiers that rushed forward.

&quot;Dead Scream.&quot;

A purple blast of energy thundered from the heavens themselves and 
entire ranks of the approaching humans were once again decimated, 
coating the ground with their blood and spent bodies. The air around the 
two outer senshi rustled with anxious energy, a tangible mist circled 
and gathered, and finally, Sailor Pluto was revealed, her Time Staff 
gleaming menacingly in the red tinted sky. She looked weary and worn, 
but eager to help her friends.

&quot;You called?&quot; The garnet eyed woman asked mystically.

Uranus rolled her eyes. &quot;Always the dramatic entry.&quot; She chided their 
ally.

Neptune smiled in greeting. Pluto&#39;s help was no doubt a relief, yet even 
between the three of them, somehow she knew they wouldn&#39;t be enough. The 
coming attackers would be more difficult to fight back. They were larger 
in numbers, their chances of holding these humans back from entering the 
palace was bleak. Her unease mounted. And the telling look in Pluto&#39;s 
avoiding expression told her all she needed to know. She had known all 
along. And ...she knew what was to come.

Suddenly, the hairs on the back of Neptune&#39;s neck stood on edge. &quot;Deep 
Submerge!&quot; She shouted, her projectile slamming into the front that had 
begun their approach. Her long range attack momentarily spent, she 
looked up to that menacing figure in the sky and her senses went on full 
alert. The black creature was looking at the three of them, thoughtfully 
considering its opposition, and in a charge of light born from the 
center of its form, Neptune gasped as she realized her fate. Over her 
shoulder, she saw Pluto skirt out of the way, her sideways feint almost 
akin to teleportation, but she still sensed her partner next to her 
side.

&quot;Haruka!&quot; Neptune shouted, her arms pushing Uranus&#39; form away from her 
with all her senshi strength. She breathed a sigh of relief when the 
blonde haired woman landed far enough away from her, but she knew there 
was no time left to save herself.

A spark of blinding electricity arched through the sky and the air was 
suddenly alive with energy. It only took a second for Neptune to fall to 
the ground, unmoving. It had happened so fast that the aqua haired woman 
hadn&#39;t even had the chance to scream.

With wide eyes, Uranus&#39; jaw hung slack, unable to form words as she 
gaped in disbelief at the sight in front of her.

The Uranian woman found herself crawling on her hands and knees to her 
partner&#39;s fallen body, stunned and unfeeling as the brainwashed humans 
apathetically marched around and past their fallen forms. Detachedly, 
she noticed the dark form of the creature in the sky advance without a 
second glance. The shouts and screams of death that emerged from the 
Moon Palace barely phased Uranus at all as she pulled her partner into 
her arms gently.

The Neptunian woman&#39;s skin was burnt, singed and in some places open and 
bleeding. Her aqua hair was blackened and her senshi fuku was charred 
and torn. Though her body was still beautiful despite the pain it had 
endured, her facial expression was twisted into a contorted grimace. 
&quot;Michiru...&quot; Uranus said shakily, her halting voice barely a whisper in 
the destruction that screamed around her.

Neptune could barely feel her own body, but could sense her lover&#39;s arms 
around her. Her skin was numb and she had to wonder if she even had any 
left at all. Her internal organs were sluggish, threatening to stop 
completely. She felt like she was on fire, yet she was afforded strength 
and security of knowing that her partner had made it through safely. 
&quot;Haruka?&quot; She asked shakily. &quot;Haruka, I...&quot;

Blackness claimed her.

/flashback

&quot;Haruka...&quot; Michiru whispered, her voice barely audible, her mouth 
parched. Hot tears collected in her eyes and a shudder wracked her body 
as her hands shakily traced her arms as if expecting to find the 
injuries of her death by electrocution a millennia ago. She snorted 
unthinkingly, as though the smell of her own burnt flesh lingered still 
in her nostrils. She could detachedly sense Setsuna&#39;s grave concern, 
felt her supportive hand on top of her own. But it wasn&#39;t enough.

Nothing was enough without Haruka by her side.

&quot;What happened to Haruka after I... died?&quot; Michiru&#39;s words came 
haltingly, the violent memories playing again and again before her 
clouded eyes. Although the pain of reliving her own death was intense, 
the pain of not knowing what had happened to Haruka after she had died 
was even greater.

Setsuna fidgeted slightly on the park bench. The harsh reality of the 
fall of the Moon Kingdom and furthermore, the events that had happened 
after that were not topics easily discussed, for they were the events 
that truly held the answers to Michiru&#39;s questions.

The ancient woman&#39;s gaze hardened. Despite her reservations, it was time 
for Michiru to understand what had truly warped the woman once known as 
Haruka, and although Setsuna knew she faced certain repercussions for 
lingering too long from her post, she had a duty to her friend in 
addition to her duty as senshi. She owed at least that much to Michiru.

Michiru turned her mournful cobalt eyes to the Guardian of Time. 
&quot;Setsuna, please... I need to know.&quot;

Preview, Chapter 7:

Uranus shook her head, unbelieving. In the roar of the battle taking 
place around her, she heard only muted sounds as she stared dumbly at 
the broken beauty in her arms. This woman had shared with her the best 
of their years as friends and lovers. The thought of never hearing 
Michiru&#39;s signature giggle, never touching her sensuous curves or 
hearing the strings of her violin warm the room with her presence... it 
couldn&#39;t be true. Uranus simply couldn&#39;t imagine a future without her 
partner, couldn&#39;t come to terms with the fact that she had been left 
behind. Finally, her lover had gone to a world in which she couldn&#39;t 
follow.

Unless...

Gently, Uranus settled Neptune&#39;s body on the dusty ground at her feet. 
Tenderly, she brushed a loose strand of charred, aqua hair back from her 
forehead. She afforded her lover a small smile before leaning down to 
plant a soft kiss across her forehead.

&quot;Soon.&quot; She whispered. </pre>
