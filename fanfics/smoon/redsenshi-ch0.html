<pre>Dear Red, 

I&#39;ve got a problem. It&#39;s kind of hard to explain, but... Well, there&#39;s this guy, 
you see... gods, I didn&#39;t think anyone was allowed to be so damned gorgeous. 
He&#39;s smart, handsome and totally and utterly crazy about me, plus... ooh, I get 
goosebumps just thinking about him. You might almost say we were destined to be 
together. 

That&#39;s not the problem, though. The thing is, there&#39;s this girl... 

I know what you must think of me, but... I just can&#39;t help it. I can&#39;t explain 
it, but she just does something to me. If you saw her, though, you&#39;d understand 
- there&#39;s something about her that makes me go weak at the knees every time I 
look at her. Just sitting and writing this is making me shiver all over... 

But that&#39;s not quite the problem either. 

Ever since we met we&#39;ve always been at each others&#39; throats. Maybe we just 
rubbed each other up the wrong way, or something. I never quite worked out why, 
and I don&#39;t think she did either. Leastways, not until a couple of days ago... 

But I&#39;m getting ahead of myself. I guess this won&#39;t make much sense unless I 
start at the beginning, will it? 

------------------------------------------------------------------

It was about a week ago that it all started. I&#39;d managed to persuade Mamo-chan 
to take me on a little shopping trip, the sun was shining, his arms were full of 
bags, and everything seemed right with the world. We were walking slowly back 
towards his apartment, and I was taking the time to put my arms around his waist 
and think a little. (It&#39;d probably surprise my friends to know that I can manage 
to walk and think at the same time, but I&#39;ve got no intention of telling them.) 

Anyway, I was thinking about &quot;us&quot; - we&#39;d just... well, let&#39;s just say that we&#39;d 
been through a lot together. A lot. Things had finally calmed down, and for the 
first time I was wondering what it was going to be like to live together for the 
rest of our lives. 

Much to my father&#39;s disbelief, I&#39;m sure, Mamoru had always been the perfect 
gentleman towards me, but after all that had happened, I&#39;d finally decided that 
I wanted to take things further with him. 

That and the thought of it had been keeping me awake at nights for weeks... 

------------------------------------------------------------------

Much later, back in my own room, I wondered why I hadn&#39;t just told him earlier. 
The thought of spending the night with him had had me shivering the whole time I 
was with him... but... when I kissed him goodbye, I&#39;d thought of her. Gods, I 
don&#39;t think kissing anyone had ever felt as incredible as that. I&#39;m just glad I 
managed to stay on my feet and get out of the door. 

So there I was, totally stuck. I wanted him, but I... I wanted her as well. How 
on earth was I meant to choose between them? 

I&#39;m glad nobody was around to see me just then, because I&#39;m sure my smile would 
have sent them running for the hills. 

You see, I had a plan...
