<h1>Wishful Thinking (part 3 of 24)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/ladyhades.html">ladyhades</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/wishthink-ch2.html">Back to Part 2</a><pre>Rei winced. The black ring that was rapidly forming around her left eye 
was going to be impossible to hide. &#39;Tch. Guess I deserved that one.&#39; 
She tossed the hand mirror onto the bed and let out a sigh of defeat. 
How the hell did her life get so complicated in the past two days? An 
even more depressing thought crossed her mind. How the hell was she 
going to fix it? She wandered over to her window and pushed aside the 
blood red curtains. The other soldiers had already assembled in the 
courtyard down below. Venus had her back towards the soldiers&#39; quarters, 
and seemed to be talking rather animatedly with Mercury, arms waving 
wildly about. The blonde made a fist and slammed it into her other palm, 
with a force not unlike the one that left Rei&#39;s bruise. Mercury&#39;s eyes 
went wide, and Rei felt her heart twinge.

&#39;Oh yeah. She is definitely pissed.&#39; The bluenette patted Venus on the 
shoulder sympatheticallyand said something Rei couldn&#39;t make out.

&#39;Knowing how to read lips would be tremendously helpful right now. Maybe 
I could work that into the curriculum.&#39; she thought, absently tracing 
the bruise with her fingertips. The fire soldier chuckled in spite of 
herself. &#39;That girl does have a mean hook.&#39;

Jupiter looked up in her general direction, and Rei let the curtain 
slide back into place. She began pacing around her room, armored boots 
clinking. &#39;I can&#39;t hide up here forever, but I don&#39;t even have the first 
clue about what I should say. If I could only remember what happened, it 
just might make things a bit easier.&#39;

Her head throbbed. Yeah, as if she needed another reminder.

She paused when she came to the opposite side of the room, and rested 
her forehead against the soothingly cool wall. &#39;When did I become such a 
coward?&#39;

She closed her eyes and let out the deep breath she hadn&#39;t realized she 
had been holding. Remembering became her number one priority, and she 
certainly couldn&#39;t do it here in the palace. Besides, her head was still 
ached, and the idea of having the goddess of love beat her into the 
floor in front of everyone else was definitely not appealing, training 
match or not.

All right. Issue settled. She headed towards the door, grabbing her 
blade from the weapons rack. &#39;Humph. Had enough sense to put that away 
last night. Ah well. Time to grab the tail of the dog that bit me.&#39;

At first, she contemplated sneaking out the back door, via the exit 
tunnel built in case of an attack. No, that wouldn&#39;t do. She probably 
looked like a damn coward in the eyes of the others already. Besides, 
sneaking out would probably just send her princess into overdrive. 
Everyone knew her well enough to guess where she was headed. She could 
picture sweet Serenity marching straight into the tavern and dragging 
her out by her ear.

Her ear. She thought back to her dream, and suppressed a shudder. It had 
felt so real. Was it her hopped up imagination? Probably not. It seemed, 
as of late, that most of her dreams came to pass. Perhaps she would get 
the chance to talk it over with Pluto later. Then again, even that 
wouldn&#39;t do a whole lot of good. The aloof time guardian would probably 
give her some cryptic advice that never made sense until the crucial 
moment had passed. Damn time fluxes, or paradoxes, or whatever the hell 
Pluto called them.

A great battle was approaching, that much she knew, and Mars was pretty 
damn sure it involved the Earthlings. Maybe she should question Endymion 
on his next visit. A sadistic smile graced her features as she pictured 
ramming her armored fist into his perfect pretty boy face. The smile 
vanished quickly however, as she continued to go over the few clues the 
dream left her.

One of her fellow soldiers was supposed to die. Though, judging by the 
shape she and Jupiter had been in, she was almost confident that none of 
them would make it.

What did that mean for her princess, or worse, the queen?

Scratch that. She really did not want to think about that.

She paused, her hand resting on the door that would lead her to the 
courtyard.and to Venus. She brought her hand up to her face and sighed.

&quot;Just what the hell am I doing? Something horrible is going to happen, 
and I&#39;m worried about a stupid one night stand. I&#39;m not even sure it was 
a one night stand!

&quot;Well, you are a female.&quot; a voice teased from behind.

Mars mentally slapped herself and turned to face the speaker.

&quot;Artemis. I&#39;m surprised. You&#39;re not clawing my eyes out.&quot;

&quot;Too much work.&quot; The white feline replied with a grin. &quot;I&#39;ll leave that 
to Mina.&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot; Rei sighed. &quot;I kinda figured she&#39;d tell you.&quot;

&quot;Not bad for a petite blonde. I think we trained her well.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;Let me guess. You&#39;re gonna tell everyone you fell.&quot;

Feeling very self conscious, Rei covered her black eye.

Artemis tilted his head, as if he were shrugging. &quot;Hey. I&#39;m not going to 
scold you. You&#39;re old enough to know what the right thing to do is.&quot;

&quot;Get really, really drunk?&quot;

&quot;Now, that&#39;s what got you into this in the first place.&quot; he chided. &quot;I 
will say this though. She really does care for you.&quot;

Mars suddenly found the floor to be very, very fascinating.

&quot;Listen, Rei, you&#39;ve come a long ways. I can still remember the day you 
joined us here. You, and Jupiter, were the only ones who could handle 
the toughest training. But on down time, when the other girls ran off to 
play, you&#39;d just stand there, looking completely lost.&quot;

&quot;Venus.&quot; Rei murmured, recalling the memory with a faint smile. &quot;Venus 
is the one who made me play, and have fun.&quot;

Artemis nodded. &quot;Coming from the great war planet like you did, I wasn&#39;t 
surprised to see you become such a fierce fighter, and I know your 
loyalty and devotion is just as fierce.&quot;

Rei&#39;s eyes met his. &quot;And that&#39;s my problem.&quot; she breathed.

&quot;Let me share something I&#39;ve learned during my years of duty. Wishful 
thinking is nice, but that&#39;s all it is. Wishes. You keep looking away, 
you&#39;ll miss the real show.&quot;

&quot;The real show?&quot;

&quot;Yeah. People tend to ignore what&#39;s right in front of them, and flitter 
the hours away pining for something they can&#39;t have. Tomorrow never 
comes until it&#39;s too late.&quot; he shook his head sadly. &quot;You should 
understand that better than anyone, being a soldier.&quot;

&quot;But I can&#39;t lie, Artemis. I can&#39;t look her in the eye and promise her 
something I can&#39;t give her. That&#39;s not fair. How do you think that would 
make her feel?&quot; Rei swallowed the knot in her throat, and continued.

&quot; I could hold her, and whisper all the things she wants to hear, but 
you know what? She&#39;ll doubt me. Always. She&#39;ll wonder if I&#39;m saying 
those things to her, or to someone else. And besides, I don&#39;t even 
remember what happened yesterday, and I can&#39;t start fixing the problem 
when I&#39;m not even sure what the problem is.&quot; she shook her head to clear 
her thoughts, and sighed.

&quot;The worst part is, something very unpleasant is going to happen. I 
honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to pull through it.&quot;

Artemis felt the fur on his spine stand on end. &quot;Something that bad? You 
have another vision?&quot;

&quot;Yeah.&quot;

&quot;Have you informed the queen?&quot;

&quot;Not yet.&quot; Rei replied. &quot;But I plan to. All I know is that if we want to 
make it out of this alive, we need to be a team. Right now, I&#39;d say the 
team is a little fractured.&quot;

&quot;Understatement of the year.&quot; Artemis quipped.

Even Mars had to smile at that. &quot;No kidding. But I promise I&#39;ll fix 
this. Right now, I just need some time to think, and then I&#39;ll smooth 
things over with Venus.&quot;

Artemis nodded. &quot;I understand.&quot;

Rei knelt on the floor, and scratched the feline behind the ears. &quot;You 
know, you&#39;re not half bad, for a talking hair ball anyway.&quot;

&quot;Watch it, or I will start clawing at you.&quot; he growled.

She laughed, and rose again, shifting her sheath and resting one hand on 
the pommel of her sword. After she braced herself mentally, she let out 
a deep breath and gave the cat a toothy grin. &quot;Now. Off to the den of 
lions.&quot;

&quot;It scares me when you smile like that.&quot; Artemis muttered. &quot;Please, 
just...try not to hurt her.&quot;

Mars just spun on her heels and pushed the door open, looking as though 
she had all the confidence in the world.

That confidence quickly faded when she felt three pairs of eyes bore 
holes into her skull.

&#39;What, do I have a curse word carved into my face? Heh. I know. I bet my 
forehead says, &#39;Hey! Look at me! I kill puppies! Please! Shower me with 
disdain and stones!&#39;

Rei&#39;s steps faltered for the briefest of moments, and she was half 
tempted to turn back and run away. &#39;Yeah, look at the great Martian 
warrior. Watch the soldier of fire flee from three girls.&#39; Her resolve 
renewed, Mars cleared her throat quietly and strode purposefully towards 
the group. &#39;Just remember, &quot;great warrior&quot;, one of those girls took you 
down with one hit. Just imagine what the three of them could do 
together. I bet it would be one hell of a fight.

To her complete and utter amazement, no one hit her. That&#39;s when she 
begin to feel very nervous indeed. She could handle the hitting. She 
could handle the name calling. One thing she could not handle was not 
knowing what was going on. &#39;Oh, dear gods above. They&#39;re not going to 
turn this into some sappy hug-fest are they?&#39;

Mars decided to act first. She walked past Jupiter, and paused to rest a 
hand on her bronze shoulder guard.

&quot;Hey. Keep an eye on Mercury, alright Blinky?

&quot;Blinky?&quot; Jupiter repeated.

&quot;Yeah. Watch the sharp objects.&quot;

Jupiter let out a genuine laugh. &quot;Hey, I think you knocked her pretty 
hard Venus.&quot;

The blonde had her back turned to Rei, and was staring off into a line 
of distant trees. &quot;I&#39;m not even going to dignify that with a response.&quot; 
Venus snapped.

&quot;Makoto!&quot; Mercury called reproachfully.

The brunette just shrugged, and gave Mars a smile. &quot;These things just 
take time.&quot; she whispered helpfully.

&quot;Yeah. And I don&#39;t know how much of that we have.&quot;

Jupiter gave the raven-haired girl another confused look, but she had 
already approached Mercury.

&quot;Does um, your face hurt a lot? I can take a look at it, if you want.&quot; 
the bluenette offered quietly.

Rei shook her head no, and smiled at the small warrior. Without warning, 
she wrapped her arms around Ami and hugged her tight. A light blush rose 
to Mercury&#39;s cheeks as she hugged the fire soldier back, looking very 
perplexed. &quot;Ah, you ok Mars?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m ok. I just worry sometimes I guess.&quot;

Mars let the genius go, and finally found the courage to approach 
Minako. Mercury took this as a sign to give them room, and led Jupiter 
back into the palace.

&quot;Hey, Ami, is she ok?&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not sure. Signs of affection from her are odd, to say the least.&quot;

&quot;No kidding. Oh man, Wait.&quot; Jupiter called, tugging on Mercury&#39;s arm. &quot;I 
have a bad feeling.&quot;

&quot;Bad feeling?&quot;

Makoto nodded. &quot;Do you remember the last big battle? When we had that 
massive flow of black energy?&quot;

&quot;There were youma everywhere.&quot; Mercury recalled. &quot;I honestly think a 
horde that size would have taken down the palace, had Mars not warned 
us. She even managed to defend the lower kingdom.&quot;

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

&quot;Wait, what?&quot; Ami asked, not liking the feeling in her gut.

&quot;I think she saw something.&quot; Jupiter replied. &quot;She kinda got like this 
last time, all dark and brooding.&quot;

&quot;Mako, she&#39;s always dark and brooding. Anyways, she had a rough 
evening.&quot;

Rei&#39;s words suddenly struck Makoto hard. &#39;She told me to watch over 
Mercury, and then she hugged Ami....&#39; Jupiter suddenly stopped dead in 
her tracks, and pulled Ami into her arms.

&quot;Ok. Now I&#39;m getting confused. And it&#39;s definitely weird for me to be 
confused.&quot; Ami confessed.

Makoto tried to calm her hammering heart, and kissed the top of 
Mercury&#39;s head. &#39;I&#39;ll protect her, even if it kills me. I&#39;ve already 
wasted so much time, just trying to find her.&#39; Jupiter forced herself to 
laugh. &quot;Sorry. You just look so cuddly today.&quot;

The ice soldier sighed.

---------------------

&quot;Hey Venus, truce, ok?&quot; Mars asked quietly, holding her hands up in the 
air.

The blonde wouldn&#39;t even turn to face her.

Rei dropped her hands. &quot;Minako, please. I know you&#39;re angry....&quot;

&quot;You&#39;re damn right I&#39;m angry!&quot; she snapped, turning to face Mars at 
last. &quot; I can&#39;t believe you treated me that way!&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m sorry! I panicked!&quot;

&quot;Well that&#39;s putting it lightly!&quot;

&quot;Did you want everyone to walk in on us?&quot; Rei growled. This was going 
nowhere fast. She hadn&#39;t wanted to start another fight.

&quot;What, were you that ashamed of us? Had to hide it?&quot;

&quot;Yes!&quot; The blonde&#39;s glare could have melted tempered steel. Mars cringed 
inwardly. &quot;I mean, NO! I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m still trying to remember what 
happened.&quot; All this yelling was killing her head.

Minako was dumbfounded. &quot;You don&#39;t remember?&quot;

Mars shook her head.

&quot;Not at all?&quot;

Mars found the toes of her boots to be very entertaining.

&quot;What&#39;s the last thing you remember?&quot; Venus asked, softer this time. A 
normal tone.

&quot;Uh, the barmaid handing my money back to me, fifth round or so. She 
said I was...&quot;

&quot;..overpaying her.&quot; Minako finished quietly.

Rei swallowed hard. She hadn&#39;t even considered the fact that the blonde 
might have remembered everything.

&quot;I&#39;m sorry Mina.&quot; she whispered, taking one of Venus&#39; hands in her own. 
&quot;Just, please, give me some time to sort this out. &quot;

Minako nodded, slipping her hand out of Rei&#39;s. Rei was shocked to find 
that very small action slugged her like a fist to the solar plexus.

&quot;I can at least give you that. Besides. I feel kinda bad for punching 
you.&quot;

Mars nodded. &quot;Can I come find you later? I...I don&#39;t want this to ruin 
what we had.&quot;

&quot;Have.&quot; Venus corrected quietly. &quot;Yeah. Talk to me after you figure 
yourself out.&quot; and with that, she was gone.

Mars sighed deeply. There was only one thing left to do now.</pre>
