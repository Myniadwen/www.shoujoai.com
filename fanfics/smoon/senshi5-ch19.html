<h1>Senshi: the Gathering of Five (part 19 of 29)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/senshi5-ch18.html">Back to Part 18</a><pre>Michiru&#39;s long green hair flowed around her body as
she waited there patiently, her simple light green
dress swirling with the gentle breeze. &quot;Are you ready,
windbag?&quot; she asked her companion calmly, gaze focused
ahead of them.

&quot;Of course,&quot; Haruka shot back, &quot;water on the brain.
But are you sure you can manage without Setsuna to
hold your hand, old lady?&quot; The sandy haired young
woman dressed in jeans and a T-shirt tossed her a
cocky grin, her eyes twinkling.

&quot;Just you wait and see, child,&quot; Michiru answered, her
eyes dark with a intense hatred for the creatures that
were arrayed before them.

The Youma gazed at them restlessly, the mostly human
seeming servants of the Oni clearly confused by what
they saw. These weren&#39;t the five Senshi who had
attacked their masters, but there was something...
oddly different about them. They looked as mortal as
any creature that walked the Earth but there was an
unearthly quality about them, too.

&quot;We can&#39;t let any get away,&quot; Haruka reminded her as
the Youma cautiously encircled the two of them, &quot;to
tell their masters about us.&quot;

&quot;They won&#39;t,&quot; Michiru flashed a dangerous smile.

&quot;Then let&#39;s go,&quot; Haruka agreed.

The slim young woman raised her hand, holding it up as
the air pressure soared all around them then Haruka
hammered her fist down into the ground. Thunder boomed
loud enough to rattle their bones then lightning
struck down, the ranks of Youma blasted backwards as
the ground itself was melted white hot by the bolt of
power.

&quot;Overdone,&quot; Michiru sniffed disdainfully.

The Youma looked startled, then they cried out in fear
and alarm as all the liquid poured out of their forms.
In only seconds the front rank dropped, dehydrated
husks crumbling to dust as the liquid swirled around
Michiru, her eyes glowing an eerie ice blue. With a
gesture water scythed out like a blade and more Youma
died.

&quot;Not bad,&quot; Haruka acknowledged, moving over to stand
at Michiru&#39;s side as the surviving Youma started to
rally.

Michiru gave Haruka a glance and was surprised to see
no sign of mocking in her eyes. &quot;You&#39;re not so bad
yourself,&quot; she agreed.

They looked so similar standing there, twin elemental
forces now embodied in fragile human forms. A goddess
warrior of the skies calling the lightning to heel
along with the mistress of the waters, as deep and
deadly as the darkest seas. With a howl the surviving
Youma charged them, but the two women were ready for
it.

From the puddles of water her powers left Michiru
called it forth, in seconds fragments of shining light
forming a simple hand mirror. &quot;Illuminate the depths,&quot;
she murmured, power arching around her, &quot;of their
evil.&quot; A beam of light, brighter than the sun, blazed
out and the Youma simply evaporated into mist.

&quot;Shining blade,&quot; Haruka&#39;s eyes seemed to flash along
with the rumbling of the storm clouds high above them,
&quot;cut away the darkness!&quot; The bolt of lightning came
down then seemed to stop above the ground, swirling
electricity that Haruka thrust her hand into. From the
light she drew forth the saber, the crescent shaped
weapon glowing with power and then in a single sweep
she cut down the remaining foes.

Michiru felt her breath coming a bit faster and she
could hear Haruka panting beside her. &quot;Too bad the Oni
don&#39;t die so easily,&quot; she managed.

Haruka leaned on her blade, bits of lightning still
dancing along the golden blade. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she agreed.
She pushed her sweaty hair from her eyes as she looked
over at Michiru, &quot;You know, I think I&#39;m beginning to
understand why my father liked you.&quot; She grinned as
she added, &quot;Even though you pissed him off so much.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Michiru looked surprised.

&quot;You&#39;re not only good at what you do,&quot; Haruka made
herself stand, &quot;but you enjoy your work.&quot; She cupped
the sword in her hands as she murmured a soft thank
you, then it simply dissolved into the lightning,
shooting back into the sky.

Light danced around her fingers as Michiru released
her own weapon, the shining mirror dissolving into the
waters once again. &quot;That sword,&quot; Michiru looked over
at Haruka as they set off away from the deserted lot,
&quot;it was your father&#39;s, right?&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; Haruka nodded as they reached the car Setsuna
had provided them.

&quot;I&#39;m sure he&#39;d be glad to see it being wielded with
honor,&quot; Michiru said serenely, watching Haruka slide
behind the wheel. The storm elemental was oddly
comfortable with the automobiles, unlike her, so she
was glad to let her drive.

&quot;You and my father never seemed to get along very
well,&quot; Haruka started up the car and swung them out
onto the street, &quot;why was that?&quot;

&quot;He never said?&quot; Michiru looked over at Haruka
curiously.

&quot;No, not really,&quot; Haruka shook her head as they
smoothly moved through traffic, &quot;it was odd, he&#39;d
speak of you with such fondness then he&#39;d suddenly
curse you for no reason.&quot;

&quot;I have no wish to speak of the dead,&quot; Michiru said
with a sigh, &quot;without him being here to give his side
of it.&quot;

Haruka&#39;s hands tightened on the wheel. &quot;There is no
one else I can ask,&quot; she sighed, &quot;other than Setsuna,
maybe.&quot;

Michiru smiled wryly, &quot;I suspect she&#39;d tell you if you
asked.&quot; She looked out at the passing city as she
silently wrestled with it then said, &quot;It began when I
and he had been called upon by Setsuna some years ago
to prevent a human occultist from freeing the Oni.&quot;

&quot;Father spoke of that occasionally,&quot; Haruka agreed, &quot;a
Professor Tomoe sought the Oni&#39;s aid in healing his
sickly daughter.&quot;

&quot;We worked closely together, became friends,&quot; Michiru
said softly, &quot;while we fought against Tomoe&#39;s
servants, a coven of five devious and powerful
witches.&quot;

Haruka was listening intently, even as she drove them
to the suite that they were sharing with Setsuna.
&quot;Tomoe nearly succeeded,&quot; Haruka recalled the tales
that her father told, &quot;he sent his daughter Hotaru
into the Oni&#39;s realm shortly before you defeated him.&quot;

&quot;We lost Hotaru to the Oni,&quot; Michiru agreed, &quot;a
failure that I have always regretted. Once the battle
ended your father spoke to me, revealing feelings that
ran much deeper than friendship.&quot;

&quot;What?!&quot; Haruka blurted, nearly losing control of the
car in her surprise.

&quot;Eeep,&quot; Michiru squeaked, grabbing the console. Once
she was sure that they were going to be fine she
continued, &quot;The Stormlord said that he was in love
with me.&quot;

&quot;What did you do?&quot; Haruka asked as they finally pulled
up in front of their building. The two stayed in the
car, taking advantage of the momentary privacy.

&quot;I had to tell him the truth,&quot; Michiru said, giving
Haruka a cautious look as she continued, &quot;that I had
always preferred the company of females.&quot;

&quot;Oh,&quot; Haruka took a moment before she fully registered
it, &quot;oh!&quot;

Michiru pushed her hair back nervously, &quot;Setsuna
already knows about me, of course.&quot; She smiled wryly,
&quot;She seems to know everything at times.&quot;

Haruka didn&#39;t meet Michiru&#39;s eyes as she softly said,
&quot;It&#39;s all right.&quot;

&quot;Not from the way you&#39;re acting, I think.&quot; Michiru
said. She wanted to put a hand on the suddenly tense
younger woman&#39;s arm but wasn&#39;t sure if it would we
well received.

Suddenly Haruka was out the car door, standing beside
the car as the sun began to break through the clouds.
&quot;You don&#39;t know me,&quot; she coldly looked back at Michiru
as she scrambled out of the car, &quot;don&#39;t act as if you
do.&quot;

&quot;Haruka?&quot; Michiru blinked in confusion.

&quot;We&#39;d better go inside and wait to hear from Setsuna,&quot;
Haruka lead the way at a brisk pace, &quot;she might need
our help if the meeting with the Senshi goes badly.&quot;

Michiru followed, shaking her head as she thought,
&#39;What is going on with this girl?&#39;
