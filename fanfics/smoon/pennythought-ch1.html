<h1>A Penny for Your Thoughts</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/no1sangel.html">no1sangel</a><br> </h2>
<pre>	Ami sat her books on her desk and turned on her computer screen, 
all these movements were automatic. A pattern she did everyday after 
coming home from either school, visiting her friends, or fighting youma. 
She never noticed how mundane everything seemed to be becoming now 
seeing as there hasn&#39;t been that many battles that needed to be fought 
or classes she needed to hurry off to. And her friends were all gone on 
vacation right now leaving her to her own devices at home. True they 
each had tried to invite her to go with one of them but she just 
reassured them that she had a lot of studying to do and her mother was 
going to be taking a break from work too very soon so they could spend 
some &quot;Quality Time&quot; together. So she couldn&#39;t really blame her friends 
for her boredom. Which surprised her when has studying ever really made 
her bored. Or her whole schedule of things she has done pretty much 
since she could remember. Never. So what was this feeling like she was 
missing something? Ami stared at her computer screen and for the life of 
her tried to think of the reason why she felt so alone right at that 
moment. 

	&quot;Maybe it is because I miss my friends,&quot; Ami mused. &quot;They are all 
on a nice vacation while I am just here.&quot; Then she thought again, &quot;well 
not &quot;all&quot; of my friends are away.&quot; She had a thought and went to grab 
the phone and dialed up a number she had almost forgotten. Well almost 
come on it is Ami no one can be perfect.

	&quot;Hello Michiru?&quot;

	&quot;Why hello Ami,&quot; the water senshi&#39;s voice politely said on the 
other end.

	&quot;Yes...umm...would it be a bother at all if I- that is-ummm-wanted 
to come over.&quot; Ami said while nervously twisting the phone cord around 
her finger.

	&quot;Oh is there something troubling you Ami?&quot; Michiru&#39;s voice was 
laced with concern, making Ami want to get rid of any thought that 
something was.

	&quot;Well no, I guess I am just lonely and I know that we haven&#39;t 
spent much time together as I am sure myself or any of the others would 
have liked.&quot;

	&quot;Well alright, I am just about to start some dinner and Haruka is 
watching a race but it will be over soon so if you could keep her 
company and make sure she doesn&#39;t try to pester me in the kitchen than 
that will be greatly appreciated.&quot;

	&quot;Hai, I will be over than in a few minutes.&quot; Ami hung up the phone 
slightly relieved that she had now something to do. And maybe the older 
senshi&#39;s wisdom would come in handy when it came to having to figure out 
what was troubling her so.

	It took about twenty minutes for Ami to get over to their place, 
and the whole time her mind was blank. Well no that wasn&#39;t true, her 
thoughts were so jumbled she couldn&#39;t make out any of them. But before 
total and utter confusion settled in she decided that it would be best 
to just stop thinking. Something of course she wasn&#39;t used to but 
everything that seemed to be happening lately didn&#39;t seem at all normal 
for her. She raised her hand to knock on the door and hesitated for a 
minute before she rapped on it. 

	&quot;Why hello,&quot; Haruka drawled giving Ami her usual nonchalant smile. 
&quot;Come in and make yourself comfortable.&quot; She motioned to her with a 
slight bow and wave of her hand. 

	&quot;Thank you Haruka.&quot; Ami replied bowing her head slightly while 
walking past the elder senshi. 

	&quot;Haruka is that Ami?&quot; Michiru called from the kitchen.

	&quot;Yeah,&quot; Haruka said with a smile, &quot;she finally decided to grace us 
with her presence&quot;

	Michiru entered the living room and playfully slapped her lover on 
the shoulders with a dish towel. &quot;Now Ruka don&#39;t make fun of poor Ami 
she is coming here as a favor for me.&quot;

	&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; Haruka said raising an eyebrow.

	&quot;Mmm hmm.&quot;

	&quot;Is there something I should know?&quot; 

	&quot;Well I called her over here for some protection.&quot;

	&quot;Protection?&quot; This statement confused the otherwise calm and 
leveled woman, &quot;protection from what, who?!&quot;

	&quot;Now darling don&#39;t get so worked up.&quot; Michiru said placing a hand 
upon her love&#39;s cheek, &quot;it&#39;s nothing serious.&quot;

	&quot;I am not getting worked up,&quot; replied Haruka as she realized that 
she was indeed getting worked up by what her partner was telling her. &quot;I 
am just curious is all. What could Ami possibly protect you from that 
you can&#39;t ask me to do.&quot;

	&quot;Why it&#39;s only to keep me safe from the most notorious of 
villains.&quot;

	&quot;Really, do tell&quot; 

	Michiru looked over at Ami and winked, &quot;why you of course.&quot;

	This grabbed the air senshi&#39;s attention, &quot;What?!&quot;

	&quot;Why Ruka you know I can&#39;t make a decent meal if you are around 
distracting me.&quot;

	Haruka leaned over and whispered to Ami, &quot;like she has ever really 
complained.&quot;

	Through all the interplay between the two outer senshi Ami was 
getting a little embarrassed and enthralled at the same time. The two 
bickered like how Rei and Usagi usually do but they are so into each 
other it&#39;s plain as day.

	&quot;Oh yes Haruka I assured Michiru that I would make sure that your 
villainous activities will be far away from her and the kitchen.&quot; Ami 
said with a smile tugging at her lips.

	&quot;Yeah yeah.&quot; Haruka waved dismissively, &quot;so Ami what is the real 
reason why you are here?&quot;

	&quot;Why what do you mean?&quot;

	&quot;Oh come on, people just don&#39;t come over here just to chat and as 
you put it make sure my villainous acts are far from Michi and the 
kitchen. So what is the real deal.&quot;

	&quot;B-but it&#39;s true, I mean I did call just to have dinner and talk.&quot; 
Ami said walking over to the couch her legs didn&#39;t seem to want to hold 
her up as her nerves were starting to get the best of her. 

	&quot;Yes that may me true, but-&quot; strolling over to sit in the chair in 
front of the couch Haruka looked directly into Ami&#39;s eyes and asked, 
&quot;there is something else isn&#39;t there.&quot;

	&quot;umm...well...it&#39;s just...that...it&#39;s nothing really.&quot; 

	&quot;Ami, you do know that if there is anything you need help with 
that Michiru and myself are here for you right.&quot; 

	&quot;Yes and I do thank you both for that. But in all honesty I am 
just over to enjoy a nice dinner with two friends of mine that I haven&#39;t 
been able to speak with in a long time. But if there is anything I will 
tell you both.&quot; Trying to plaster on a smile that didn&#39;t want to stay 
on, Ami looked over in the direction of the kitchen and stood up. 
Umm...I think I will go and see if I can help and set the table. Before 
she could go Haruka reached over and grabbed her arm. 

	Haruka saw the confusion and hurt that lied within Ami&#39;s eyes and 
decided to keep what she was originally going to say to herself for the 
time being. She knew how scary this part of a young woman&#39;s life can be, 
especially if you were like Ami and you didn&#39;t know how to deal with 
these feelings. But she just wanted to really help out the young inner 
senshi, &quot;Now don&#39;t go and do that, you are the guest after all even if 
you are playing at Michi champion. Setting the table is the only thing I 
can do that doesn&#39;t catch things on fire. You just sit down and relax or 
go and talk to Michi so you can make sure I don&#39;t...distract her.&quot; 
Giving Ami a playful smile Haruka got up and went to the kitchen.

	With a sigh of relief Ami sat and reflected on what was happening. 
She really did want to tell the older senshi on what was going on in her 
mind. Maybe she could help her make sense of all the turmoil that was 
happening to her recently. But she was just too scared to do it. And she 
did want to try to sort it more out for herself. She then thought that 
yes she just might go and try to keep the other water senshi company in 
the kitchen and just as she was getting up from the couch she heard a 
scream.

	&quot;Haruka! Honestly can&#39;t you just keep your hands to yourself for 
once.&quot;

	As Ami came to the kitchen she saw Haruka looking sheepish and 
grumbling grabbing the plates from the cupboard and walking to the 
dinning area to set out to what was her original task.

	&quot;Why Ami there you are,&quot; Michiru smiled at the girl. &quot;And here I 
thought you would be here to help protect me from Ruka.&quot; The mentioned 
woman stuck her head in and blew a raspberry at her lover.

	&quot;Sorry and I just thought that she would just come in to grab the 
needed supplies to set the table.&quot;

	&quot;Hmm...then you don&#39;t know Haruka that well than do you.&quot; 

	&quot;See and that is why I am here, because we inner senshi don&#39;t seem 
to know enough of you guys.&quot; Ami said standing next to Michiru.

	&quot;Well that is true, but that&#39;s not entirely why you wanted to come 
over, is it?&quot;

	Ami looked at Michiru as she was chopping away at the vegetables 
for the salad, and wondered if many people could say something that was 
both a statement and a question. &quot;umm...you know Haruka asked me the 
same thing.&quot;

	&quot;And what did you tell her?&quot;

	&quot;That I am here just to talk.&quot;

	&quot;Well if you don&#39;t feel like telling me the real reason I do 
understand, because it is as you said earlier we really don&#39;t know each 
other all that much.&quot; Michiru said looking at Ami, stopping her chopping 
at the moment.

	&quot;Oh no!&quot; Ami said looking into Michiru&#39;s eyes, &quot;it&#39;s not that. 
It&#39;s just...well...I don&#39;t know.&quot;

	&quot;Hmm...that could be a problem.&quot; 

	&quot;I mean I do know, well I think I do. But than I am not sure.&quot; Ami 
started pacing back and forth as Michiru&#39;s eyes followed her erratic 
behavior. &quot;I mean I did come over here to talk. But I guess I was just 
hoping you could tell me about what. I mean I don&#39;t enjoy studying 
anymore right now. I can&#39;t seem to concentrate and everyone left me to 
go on vacation. Minako went to London, Rei went to some convention, 
Usagi went to the states to Mamoru and well Makoto went to Paris to 
study French cuisine with a friend she met online. And more than likely 
he probably looks like or even reminds her of her old sempai. And well 
in France love seems to be in the air, and they are probably falling in 
love, declaring love to each other on the Eiffel Tower.&quot;

	Michiru just looked at Ami as she was getting into her impassioned 
speech. Of why she didn&#39;t seem to know why she came over to talk. And 
the more Ami was trying to explain why she didn&#39;t know what was wrong. 
Michiru was getting the idea that she indeed did know what was wrong. 
And poor Ami didn&#39;t have a clue. Or that maybe deep down she did but she 
just didn&#39;t know how to bring it to light, and then she had an idea. 
&quot;hmm falling in love in Paris huh? Sounds awfully romantic.&quot;

	Michiru&#39;s statement drew Ami out of her speech and her eyes got 
big in shock &quot;but she doesn&#39;t even know the guy! For all she knows he 
could be some real creep.&quot;

	&quot;Oh Ami do you think Makoto couldn&#39;t take care of herself and that 
she would have such bad judgment that she would let that happen?&quot;

	&quot;No, I didn&#39;t mean that.&quot; Embarrassed on hearing back what she 
just said Ami felt bad, and not only that but stupid. Surely Makoto 
wouldn&#39;t do anything like that. And so what if she did fall in love with 
that French boy and they declared their undying love underneath a full 
moon as he stared into her deep emerald pools. Probably running his 
hands through her thick and beautiful hair, running it down to caress 
her cheek, leaning forward to taste- wait what am I thinking.

	&quot;What&#39;s wrong Ami?&quot; Michiru asked trying to look innocent. She 
knew where Ami&#39;s thoughts were taking her. 

	&quot;huh what?&quot; 

	&quot;Well you started mumbling something about emerald pools and 
beautiful hair.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh I did?&quot; Ami started blushing

	&quot;Now do you feel ready to tell me what is really wrong.&quot;

	&quot;Umm..I guess could maybe it would be best if I got out some of 
these confusing feelings.&quot; 

	So as they sat down to dinner Ami poured out her heart to Michiru 
and Haruka telling them all the jumbled thoughts and feelings she has 
been having. 

	&quot;So Ami how long have you been having these feelings?&quot; Haruka 
asked leaning back in her chair.

	&quot;Well I am actually not sure, it&#39;s just when everyone left I have 
been feeling kind of lonely. And then I seem to have been getting 
distracted lately. It&#39;s getting so frustrating.&quot; Ami placed her head in 
her hands and let out a deep sigh.

	&quot;Hmm maybe we can help clear up some of your confusion.&quot; Haruka 
replied.

	&quot;Yes bring a little clarity.&quot; Michiru added. &quot;First we have to 
come to one thing.&quot; Michiru looked over at Ami, &quot;now if I am really 
getting off based just tell me.&quot;

	&quot;Oh alright.&quot; 

	&quot;Do you have a problem with Haruka&#39;s and my relationship?&quot;

	&quot;Oh no, why would you think that, I hope I didn&#39;t make it seem 
that way, I never thought anything like that about you two.&quot; Ami replied 
looking from Haruka to Michiru, &quot;I think you two make a wonderful 
couple. I wish I could be so happy.&quot;

	&quot;So you wouldn&#39;t mind dating a girl?&quot; Haruka asked raising an 
eyebrow.

	&quot;Well I never really thought about it, but I guess I wouldn&#39;t 
mind. I mean the thought doesn&#39;t repulse me.&quot; Ami said thoughtfully, &quot;I 
guess maybe I had thought about it before actually.&quot;

	&quot;Oh really,&quot; Haruka said smiling, &quot;Now let me see if I could guess 
who you might have been thinking about.&quot;

	&quot;Now really Ruka if Ami wanted to tell us than she would.&quot; Michiru 
said

	&quot;No that&#39;s no problem maybe it would help me figure out some 
things.&quot;

	&quot;Hmm...now who could it possibly be,&quot; Haruka said rubbing her chin 
in concentration. All of the sudden she jumped up and said &quot;Oh I know. 
It&#39;s Rei, I mean who wouldn&#39;t like her. She&#39;s passionate, beautiful, and 
fiercely loyal. She has all that pent up fire within her that it would 
surely set anyone&#39;s blood ablaze.&quot;

	&quot;No, Rei is nice and yes she is a really loyal friend and yes all 
you have to do is look into her eyes to see the very fire that burns 
within. But then if you look again you know who that fire burns for.&quot; 

	&quot;Oh yes the very love goddess herself.&quot; Michiru said, &quot;Those two 
do make a cute couple, hopefully one or the other will tell say that 
they love them.&quot;

	&quot;Yes I guess it would be frustrating to love someone and not 
really know it for sure.&quot; 

	&quot;Hmm okay if not Rei and obviously Minako is out of the question 
how about the other energetic blonde?&quot;

	&quot;Well Usagi is all wonderful and full of life and joy. But come on 
we all know she is destined to be with Mamoru.&quot;

	&quot;Okay so that leaves Setsuna or Makoto.&quot; Haruka stated.

	&quot;Well Setsuna and I do have a lot in common we can sit for hours 
talking about anything. But it&#39;s just a mutual friendship.&quot; 

	&quot;So it seems to leave just Makoto.&quot; Haruka said with a smirk. &quot;But 
of course she has that French boy now so-&quot;

	Ami stood up suddenly, &quot;what do you mean she has that French boy, 
just because she is off on vacation in one of the most romantic 
countries with some boy that has probably more in common with her than I 
do doesn&#39;t mean she would choose to be with him instead of-&quot;

	&quot;Instead of who?&quot; Haruka asked leaning forward.

	&quot;I mean...I mean...&quot;

	&quot;Yes...ouch!&quot; Haruka looked over at her girlfriend who just smiled 
at her, but underneath that smile she saw the look that said you better 
quit or else.

	&quot;Now Ami don&#39;t pay attention to Rucka you know how much she just 
loves to tease.&quot; Michiru said placing an arm around Ami.

	&quot;No she&#39;s right, it&#39;s been long enough that I hid these feelings. 
I need to deal with them.&quot;

	&quot;I don&#39;t want you to feel pressured now Ami,&quot; Haruka said looking 
at her, &quot;I mean I don&#39;t want you to deal with something until you know 
you are ready to deal with it.&quot;

	Ami gave a little smile, &quot;I may not be able to really deal with 
all these emotions that are coming my way,but I know one thing hat I 
have to deal with for sure.&quot; She looked from Haruka to Michiru and then 
down to her hands that she had nervously clasped in front of her. &quot;I am 
in love with Makoto.&quot; Then all of a sudden she felt a little weight come 
off of her chest. &quot;Wow that did help.&quot;

	&quot;I am glad we were able to help you deal with some of what has 
been troubling you.&quot; Michiru said placing a hand upon Ami&#39;s shoulder. 
&quot;And now maybe you will be able to deal with the rest in due time.&quot;

	&quot;Yes hopefully.&quot; Ami said smiling up at Michiru a tear forming in 
her eye. &quot;Well thank you for the wonderful dinner.&quot;

	&quot;Thank you for helping me deal with Haruka and her antics. Thanks 
to you dinner was saved.&quot; Michiru said sending a smile Haruka&#39;s way.

	&quot;Well thank you for helping me out too.&quot; Ami walked to the door 
and let herself out. She walked home in silence as her mind flew a 
hundred miles per hour trying to sort out all this new information. As 
she entered her apartment and her mom greeted, she smiled gave her mom a 
hug and went to her room. She sat in front of her computer and once 
again she was typical Ami Mizuno but with one thing different. She now 
had somewhat of a peace about her that hadn&#39;t been there for awhile, and 
maybe once all her friends came back from their trips she will feel more 
at peace. 

	A week went by and everything was pretty much normal with Ami. Her 
mom and her were able to spend the scheduled &quot;Quality Time&quot; together, 
her mom deciding that everything was indeed in order and okay with her 
only child. And all questioning and future school and career choices 
aside, Ami and her mom had a fun time together. But what made Ami&#39;s 
heart sing more was the arrival of her friends back from their 
vacations. With their arrival brought fun stories, heartfelt hellos, and 
maybe more clarity.
