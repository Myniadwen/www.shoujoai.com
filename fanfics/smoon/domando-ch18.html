<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/hmccoy.html">Songficcer</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/domando-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>The song is called &quot;If You Asked Me To&quot; by Celine Dion. I don&#39;t own the 
song nor Sailor Moon.
Makoto yawned and stretched, blinking the sleep out of her eyes. She 
felt no one next to her, and looked to see if she was right. She was.

Makoto sat up and stretched again. Her senses were returning to her and 
she could hear the shower running. The thought struck her to go join her 
lover, but stopped herself as she heard the doorbell ring. Makoto stood 
and walked into her living room, wearing nothing but her tank top and 
boxer shorts. No one aside from the senshi ever visted her, so she 
didn&#39;t see the need to dress.

As Makoto passed the couch, she saw Artemis sleeping on the couch. 
Makoto didn&#39;t see Luna, so she figured the black cat must have left 
early that morning.

Makoto reached her door, just as the person outside of it rang the bell 
again.

&quot;I&#39;m coming, I&#39;m coming,&quot; Makoto muttered to herself. She opened the 
door, to find Ami standing outside of it. Makoto blinked sleepily at the 
girl. &quot;You&#39;re here early.&quot;

Ami blinked and then looked at her wrist watch, then back to Makoto. 
&quot;Mako-chan, its past two in the afternoon...&quot;

Makoto blinked and ducked her head back in the apartment to look at her 
clock above the fireplace mantel. &quot;I&#39;ll be damned...&quot;

&quot;Did I wake you, Mako-chan?&quot;

Makoto turned back to Ami and shook her head. &quot;No. I think Minako 
showering did.&quot; Makoto yawned again before stepping aside to allow Ami 
in. &quot;Please, come in.&quot;

Ami hesitated. &quot;Y-you said Minako was here?&quot;

&quot;She lives her Ami. You know that.&quot;

&quot;I know. But I thought maybe she left for the day or something. 
Nevermind.&quot; Ami slowly walked into the apartment. &quot;I won&#39;t stay long. I 
just came by to apologize for what I&#39;ve put you and Minako thru. It was 
selfish of me and very wrong.&quot; Ami bowed to Makoto. &quot;Please, even tho I 
don&#39;t deserve it, forgive me.&quot;

Makoto smiled and nodded. &quot;Alright. I forgive you. Less stress in my 
life.&quot; Makoto offered her hand as Ami stood back up. &quot;Friends?&quot;

Ami smiled. &quot;Friends.&quot;

Makoto shook Ami&#39;s hand then looked at her face. &quot;Ami, where&#39;d you get 
the shiner?&quot;

Ami blushed. &quot;Yesterday, on the way to school...Minako-&quot;

&quot;YOU!&quot; Both Makoto and Ami jumped as Minako screamed. They turned to see 
Minako standing in a bath towel around her body and another wrapped 
around her hair. &quot;What the hell are you doin&#39; here!?&quot;

Ami gulped and seemed to shrink behind Makoto. &quot;Are you ok, Minako?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Minako growled. She stomped over to Makoto, glaring at the poor 
girl behind her. &quot;Answer me, Ami.&quot;

&quot;I..I uh...I c-came to apologize to Makoto for my actions...I didn&#39;t 
mean to cause any harm this time!&quot; Ami was so scared she was near tears.

Makoto blinked then looked to Minako. &quot;Did you hit Ami?&quot;

&quot;Yesterday, before school,&quot; Minako said, glaring. Makoto glared at 
Minako, and Minako seemed to shrink back from the older woman.

&quot;Minako..&quot;

Minako sighed and stood there a few moments, her fists clenching and un 
clenching, trying to calm her rage. &quot;Mako-chan, could you please give 
Ami and I a few moments alone?&quot;

Makoto looked to Ami then back to Minako, nodded and left to change.

Ami backed herself into a corner, fear clearly visable on her face. 
&quot;Please don&#39;t hit me again. I know I deserved it yesterday, but 
please..&quot;

&quot;I&#39;m not going to hit you, Ami.&quot; Minako sighed, releasing more of her 
anger. &quot;Look, we need to get over this so lets just cut to the chase, 
ok?&quot;

&quot;..Ok...&quot;

&quot;I want nothing more than to pumel you right now for showing your 
face..&quot; Ami swallowed hard when she heard those words. She knew Minako 
would follow thru on her threat.

&quot;However, I am the leader of the senshi and I must obtain balance within 
the group. So I have to put my feelings towards to rest to keep harsh 
feelings out. I can forgive you for what you have done, Ami. But I can&#39;t 
forget it.&quot;

Ami nodded. &quot;I understand.&quot;

Minako nodded. &quot;Good.&quot; Minako looked up at Ami, and offered her a half 
smile. &quot;Friends again?&quot;

Ami smiled and nodded. &quot;Hai.&quot;

Makoto came out into the room at that moment. &quot;Are you two buddies 
again?&quot; They bith smiled and nodded. Makoto grinned in return. &quot;Good, 
good. Ami, how about a mid afternoon snack while me and Minako have 
breakfast?&quot;

Ami nodded and came to stand beside Makoto. &quot;Sure.&quot;

&quot;I&#39;ll be with you two in a few minutes. I need to get dressed and brush 
my hair,&quot; Minako said, walking to the bedroom.

&quot;Ok,&quot; Makoto said, walking to the kitchen. &quot;When you come out, I&#39;ll have 
to tell you guys &#39;bout the weird dream I had about Artemis last 
night...&quot;
The group sat around Rei&#39;s room, idley doing nothing.

&quot;I am so bored,&quot; Usagi whined. &quot;Why don&#39;t we see a movie?&quot;

&quot;Nothing out we wanna see,&quot; Rei said. &quot;We thought of that while you were 
out with Mamoru...&quot;

Ami idley played on Rei&#39;s computer, when a thought struck her. &quot;Where 
are Tori and Karasu?&quot;

Chibi Usa looked up from the gameboy she borrowed from Usagi. &quot;They 
recieved an urgent message from the future and had to go back home..&quot;

&quot;What kind of message did they recieve,&quot; Artemis asked.

Chibi Usa shrugged. &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;

The group was silent for a moment.

&quot;Lets check the news. Maybe there&#39;s a battle to be had,&quot; Makoto said, a 
happy glint in her eyes.

Minako glared at her. &quot;There better not be. You have yet to practice 
your powers.&quot;

Makoto glared back as she flipped the small televison on then flipped it 
to the news. The channel seemed to be showing a large, black diamond of 
some sort. The senshi just sorta stared.

&quot;Since when did they do coverage of jewelry on the news,&quot; Usagi asked.

&quot;Thats not jewelry...&quot; Makoto said. And she was right. The camera 
spanned back from the black crystal, showing it to be as large as many 
of the buildings in downtown Tokyo.

&quot;Its growing right out of the ground,&quot; Ami said.

&quot;Its another attack,&quot; Rei said. All heads turned toward Makoto. And 
Minako was the one to say what they all were thinking.

&quot;You stay here.&quot;

Makoto&#39;s jaw dropped. &quot;WHAT!?&quot;

&quot;You heard me. We can&#39;t risk you going out to fight until you&#39;ve been 
trained in your new powers.&quot;

Makoto growled and stood, storming out of the room and into the open 
court outside, the girls following her. She drew her pen from her pocket 
and turned back to glare the others. And before they could argue her, 
she threw her hand up and screamed -

&quot;JUPITER DRAGON STAR POWER, MAKE -UP!&quot;

Green light exploded from the mouth of the jade dragon that sat atop 
Makoto&#39;s pen. The green light crackled with energy as it soared up, 
taking the form of a serpentine type dragon. The dragon looped behind 
Makoto and crashed into her mid back, and Makoto screamed both in pain 
and in a battle cry.

The light engulfed her, blinding everyone her and every one around her. 
When the light faded, Sailor Jupiter stood, her face down casted. Her 
uniform seemed to be the same with some slight alterations. The jewel 
that once held her bow was replaced with an emerald dragon, much like 
the praying one that was atop her henishen pen. She wore no gloves, and 
the midsection of her fuku was gone, leaving only the breast support and 
the skirt. Her boots and the colours of the fuku remained the same.

Sailor Jupiter looked up, her eyes glowing slightly.

&quot;Lets go..&quot;
When the Senshi arrived to the location of the crystal tower, the sounds 
of another battle were heard. The senshi rounded a corner and saw 
Sapphire cut, bruised and bleeding quite badly. he was slouched a bit, 
still in a fighting postion. Floating above him, near the crystal, was a 
man clothed in nothing but a large flowing cloak with a hood, hiding 
every part of him except his hands, which were cupping a crystal ball, 
levating out in front of him.

&quot;Wise Man!&quot; The senshi turned their attention to another man that 
appeared next the man in the cloak. &quot;I do not want him dead!&quot;

&quot;But my Prince, he has betrayed us. He deserves nothing less than 
death..&quot;

&quot;I want him alive Wise Man.&quot;

Wise Man went silent.

The senshi ran towards Sapphire as he continued to stand his ground.

&quot;My Prince, these are the people your brother helped. He betryed us and 
killed one of our own for his own benifet.&quot;

&quot;LIES!&quot; Sapphire cried out. &quot;You killed Emerald for failing YOUR 
cause!Diamond! He plans on killing me despite what you say..HE PLAN ON 
KILLING US BOTH!&quot;

As Sapphire finished speaking, Wise Man shot a beam of energy towards 
Sappire. Sapphire screamed in pain, white mist flowing out from his 
back, then fading as it drifted towards the sky. Sappire himself 
collapsed, lifeless to the ground.

&quot;SAPPIRE!&quot; Diamondscreamed, anguish in voice. &quot;Wise Man! I said I wanted 
him alive!&quot;

Wise Man was silent for a moment then said, &quot;We do not need him.&quot; Then 
he vanished.

Diamond floated down to his fallen brother, the senshi moving away from 
him. He knealed, hugging Sapphire&#39;s lifeless body to him. &quot;I&#39;m so 
sorry...&quot; He then collected his dead brother in his arms, turned away 
from the senshi, and vanished.
Minako and Makoto went home, Makoto, after powering down, quite tired 
after her power rush. Usagi went to Rei&#39;s for the night. Ami, headed 
home.

As she walked into her home, she saw a note from her mother saying 
dinner was in the oven, and she&#39;d see her daughter tomorrow.

Ami left the note where it was and peeked around the corner to see Raiga 
watching tv.

&quot;Make yourself at home...&quot;

Raiga turned towards Ami, and smiled. &quot;Ok, I will.&quot;

Ami smiled at him, loving and warm. Raiga blinked at her. Before he 
could question it, Ami spoke.

&quot;I&#39;m going to go change into my night clothes. Could you meet me 
upstairs in, say, fifteen minutes?&quot;

Raiga blinked and nodded. &quot;Sure.&quot;

Ami smiled. &quot;Thanks.&quot; Ami turned and walked up the stairs to her room, 
closing the door softly. As she began to change, her thoughts drifted to 
Makoto again, and what had happened earlier that afternoon before Rei&#39;s. 
Minako had decided to go get a few things from the store for Makoto so 
she could cook, leaving Makoto and Ami alone.

&quot;Ami,&quot; Makoto had said, &quot;Do you love Raiga?&quot;

Ami had blinked at the question. &quot;I..don&#39;t know..&quot;

Makoto smiled at her. &quot;I know he loves you. You can tell by how he looks 
at you. Do you still want to be with me?&quot;

Ami blushed, stuttered, and nodded. Makot smiled more.

&quot;I&#39;m going to do something, and it has to stay between you and me. 
Afterwards, I&#39;m going to ask you again if you want to be with me.&quot; Ami 
looked at Makoto confused. Makoto closed the space between her and Ami, 
cupped the small girl&#39;s face and softly pressed her lips against her&#39;s.

Ami returned the kiss before Makoto pulled away.

&quot;Do you still want to be with me?&quot;

Something was a miss. Ami had once thought she could never live without 
Makoto. But if that was true, why had she felt like she had just been 
kissing her sister?

&quot;No.&quot;

Makoto smiled. &quot;Go be with Raiga. He won&#39;t ever leave you..&quot;
Ami smiled at the fond memory, as she finsihed dressing. Makoto had been 
right. Ami knew Raiga would love her and she would love him. And she and 
Makoto would be good friends despite everything that had happened 
between them.

Ami turned and smiled as Raiga knocked on the door softly then entered.

&quot;Ami-chan?&quot;

Ami smiled and took his hand and guided him into the room. She closed 
the door and turned her radio on. She shut off her lights except the one 
at her desk, which gave off a soft yellow light. Ami turned her cd 
player on and switched it to one of her cds, and music began to play. As 
the words began to drift from the speakers, Ami wrapped her arms around 
Raiga, singing to him softly..

&quot;Used to be that I believed in something
Used to be that I believed in love
It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone
I said I&#39;d never let nobody near my heart again darlin&#39;
I said I&#39;d never let nobody in

But if you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever
If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to
If you asked me to

Somehow ever since I&#39;ve been around you
Can&#39;t go back to being on my own
Can&#39;t help feeling darling since I&#39;ve found you
That I&#39;ve found my home
That I&#39;m finally home
I said I&#39;d never let nobody get too close to me darling
I said I needed, needed to be free

(But if you asked me to...)

Asked me to, I will give my world to you baby
I need you now
Ask me to and I&#39;ll do anything for you baby, for you baby

If you asked me to
I&#39;d let you in my life forever
If you asked me to...&quot;

Ami smiled up at Raiga. He looked at her confused.

&quot;I don&#39;t understand...&quot;

Ami smiled more. &quot;I love you. Thats all you need to understand.&quot;</pre>
