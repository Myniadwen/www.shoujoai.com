<pre>I wanted to try a songfic, and this is the result. ^^ I may post my 
multi-chapter stories here too soon. I hoped to bring out Haruka&#39;s more 
vulnerable side in this piece. Please enjoy.

[text] = song lyrics

----------

Haruka glared out the window absent-mindedly. All had seemed far too 
quiet for her liking since Michiru left. A few weeks prior to the 
present they had gotten into a heated argument about their priorities, 
causing the aqua-haired lady to move away from Haruka. the sandy blonde 
pressed her fingers against the frosty window, watching the raindrops 
fall down gracefully. She remembered how Michiru often enjoyed gazing 
out the window at the falling rain. She said it calmed her and made the 
outside world feel peaceful, though Haruka never exactly understood how 
lazily staring at water falling from the sky did that. But now that she 
had nothing to do but sulk around the seemingly unoccupied house, she 
began to understand what Michiru meant. Her eyes still fixated out the 
window, Haruka brought a radio closer to her and turned it on. A song 
softly came out of its speakers.

[Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away
If only I knew what I know today
Ooh, ooh]

Despite last seeing her loved one weeks ago, the moment stuck in 
Haruka&#39;s memory as if it happened only yesterday. She took Michiru&#39;s 
love for granted, and she just left. Without really giving warning. The 
normally strong senshi felt her heart shatter like a mirror when she 
read a note Michiru left before disappearing. With anger at herself, she 
had crumpled it into a tight wad and thrown it against the wall. Michiru 
was one of the few things that made Haruka happy, one of the few that 
understood her, and loved her just for herself. Now that was gone. 
Possibly forever. However, she couldn&#39;t cry. She wouldn&#39;t let herself. 
The pain would have to be hidden beneath her tough, masculine exterior. 
Not that it was much of a challenge. Haruka had been doing it nearly her 
whole life.

[I would hold you in my arms
I would take the pain away
Thank you for all you&#39;ve done
Forgive all your mistakes]

Being beside the window soon ignited another memory: the moment when 
Michiru held Haruka&#39;s hand tenderly and said she liked her hands. 
Michiru&#39;s hands were heavenly, so soft and gentle. The memory of how 
they felt was distant in Haruka&#39;s mind, but it was indeed there. It felt 
like the first time they connected, almost became one. Michiru&#39;s 
crystalline eyes, pure, shining, cerulean eyes, had met Haruka&#39;s teal 
pair and for the first time in Haruka&#39;s life, it felt as if  someone was 
looking into her soul. Cheesy, yes, it may sound, but that was exactly 
how Haruka felt that moment. The gorgeous eyes belonging to Michiru held 
an abundance of love and happiness, the same that was shown in her 
pearly smile. Now that was gone. Haruka may never get to see that again. 
Just further proof you don&#39;t know what you have until it&#39;s gone, she 
figured.

Haruka yawned. Maybe she should sleep some more. At least in her dreams 
Michiru would still be with her. In her dreams, they would be happy, and 
Haruka wouldn&#39;t have made any mistakes. Why is it that life was so much 
better when sleeping? Right now in her current mood, Haruka wouldn&#39;t 
mind an eternal sleep if it meant being with Michiru only in her 
slumber. Certainly it would feel better than sulking with memories of 
the bitter reality still fresh in her mind.

[There&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t do
To hear your voice again
Sometimes I wanna call you
But I know you won&#39;t be there]

It seemed ever since Michiru had left to live alone, she had avoided 
talking on the phone whenever possible. Probably just in case it turned 
out to be Haruka. How could Haruka apologize for her mistakes if Michiru 
wouldn&#39;t permit her the chance? And surely if Haruka stopped by her new 
home (given she found out where exactly it was located), Michiru 
wouldn&#39;t allow her to enter, let alone even open the door. Had she 
really been that bad? Of course, that was a rhetorical question. She 
sighed sadly. Of all the times, why then. when she had someone who cared 
about her?

[Ohh I&#39;m sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn&#39;t do
And I&#39;ve hurt myself by hurting you]

That&#39;s sure how it seemed now. By hurting someone she loved, she 
ultimately hurt herself.

Love. What was the true meaning of the word anyway? Sometimes all it did 
was cause trouble, lead to jealousy, even destroy people entirely. 
Haruka sighed with aggravation while drumming her icy fingers against 
the board in front of the window. She hadn&#39;t thought this much for as 
long as she could remember. Mainly her daily routine consisted of 
physical labor, but it seemed the gloomy weather made her melancholy 
today especially. Every time Haruka tried to rid her mind of all 
thoughts of Michiru, they returned like an unwanted boomerang. The song 
playing on the radio seemed to drag on for an eternity.

[Some days I feel broke inside but I won&#39;t admit
Sometimes I just wanna hide &#39;cause it&#39;s you I miss
And it&#39;s so hard to say goodbye
When it comes to this, oooh]

Goodbye certainly was a painful word, Haruka had learned. Ironically it 
particularly hurt when you didn&#39;t have the chance to say it. Like with 
her lover. She left without notice, leaving Haruka speechless for quite 
some time. All the racer desired lately was to hide in her house where 
no one could comment on her unusual behavior. Not like she ever liked 
people asking her what was wrong anyway. If anything she saw it as an 
unnecessary annoyance. However, one  certain person could ask Haruka and 
not irritate her...

[Would you tell me I was wrong?
Would you help me understand?
Are you looking down upon me?
Are you proud of who I am?]

Michiru would&#39;nt point out Haruka&#39;s faults, no matter how bad a mistake 
was made. That&#39;s what made Haruka love her. How forgiving she was. One 
could say that softened up Haruka a bit, but when you&#39;re in love you 
don&#39;t care what others have to say about you. An empty feeling lingered 
in Haruka&#39;s stomach, hungering for the other half of her. Her soul mate.

[There&#39;s nothing I wouldn&#39;t do
To have just one more chance
To look into your eyes
And see you looking back]

Despite the way Haruka turned down the opportunity to be one of 
Michiru&#39;s models when they first met, the moment their eyes first met 
was precious. It rang in Haruka&#39;s mind like a harmonious ballad, like 
one of the songs they would play together. Michiru would play a lovely 
violin piece, often accompanied with her partner on the piano. Sure, one 
was good without the other, but together, they could make such beautiful 
music.Now the sight of a piano only torn Haruka&#39;s heart slightly more.

[Ohh I&#39;m sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn&#39;t do
And I&#39;ve hurt myself, ohh

If I had just one more day
I would tell you how much that I&#39;ve missed you
Since you&#39;ve been away
Ooh, it&#39;s dangerous
It&#39;s so out of line
To try and turn back time]

Would Haruka turn back time if given the chance? Probably. That is, if 
she could somehow prevent her foolish faults from reoccurring. Repeating 
the past would only put the already heart-wretched female deeper in a 
pool of sorrow. Then again, if turning back time were so easy, she may 
have never met Michiru. And despite her current emotional state, she&#39;d 
rather have loved and loss Michiru than have never met her at all. That 
was how sacred Haruka&#39;s memories were. She treasured them like an 
irreplaceable heirloom.

[I&#39;m sorry for blaming you
For everything I just couldn&#39;t do
And I&#39;ve hurt myself...]

Tired of the lugubrious song, Haruka, with her eyelids partially hiding 
her exhausted teal eyes, reached over to turn off the radio. Before 
sleep conquered her and some glistening tears slowly rolled down her 
face, she softly murmured to herself, &quot;...by hurting you.&quot;

I think it turned out more sad and dramatic than previous stories I&#39;ve 
done. Hopefully that&#39;s not a bad thing, heh. Please feel free to sned a 
review or PM me. I&#39;d like that a lot. In any case, thank you for 
reading!</pre>
