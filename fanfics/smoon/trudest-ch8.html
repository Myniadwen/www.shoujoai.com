<h1>True Destiny (part 8 of 10)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/kazeko.html">kazeko</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/trudest-ch7.html">Back to Part 7</a><pre>Haruka watched the shoreline speed past, the waves breaking before and 
foaming behind the great ship.  Rei had decided to forego her return to 
Kinki, and Ami was not in Chugoku, so the cruise ship was speeding 
around the southwestern tip of Honshu&#39;s Yamaguchi-ken to land in Okinawa 
and return to Kyushu&#39;s Nagasaki-ken before the rendezvous with Makoto 
and Ami in Shikoku.  Haruka knew the scenic trip would leave them in the 
water throughout the night, and she wondered how she could possibly 
sleep with Michiru lying in the room next to her.  She hadn&#39;t realized 
until she kissed the aqua-haired beauty that she wanted the woman very 
much.  Haruka closed her eyes and imagined running her hands over 
Michiru&#39;s soft skin, pulling her dress off and marveling at the white 
skin underneath, kissing her neck, her belly, her breasts . . .
 
&quot;My!  Aren&#39;t we ambitious!&quot;
 
Haruka started at the liquid voice, relaxing as she realized that the 
young duchess was smiling.  &quot;How did you know?&quot;
 
Michiru stopped beside Haruka, hands clasped in front of her, deep 
sapphire eyes sparkling in the sunlight.  &quot;I&#39;m not sure.  But I heard 
your thoughts from down below, and your lust is pulsing off you in 
waves.&quot;
 
Haruka blushed slightly, smiling as she wrapped an arm around Michiru&#39;s 
waist and pulled the woman to her side.  &quot;It&#39;s all your fault, you know.  
If you weren&#39;t so hot, I wouldn&#39;t be making love to you in my mind.&quot;
 
&quot;You could always do it for real,&quot; Michiru whispered, purring against 
the blonde&#39;s side.  &quot;You&#39;ve gotten me curious.&quot;
 
&quot;Won&#39;t your parents be angry?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course, but I don&#39;t care anymore.  I want to be with you, Ruka, no 
matter what anyone else thinks.&quot;
 
Haruka looked down at Michiru, startled by the name.  &quot;What did you call 
me?&quot;
 
&quot;Ruka.  I&#39;ve been thinking about it since we met, and I do not believe 
that Haru is a very good nickname for you.  I like Ruka, hard and soft 
at the same time, a tough exterior, but with a musical quality.  Do you 
mind?&quot;
 
&quot;It&#39;s perfect.  How do you know about my musical talent?&quot;
 
&quot;I don&#39;t know.  I just do.&quot;  Michiru took both of Haruka&#39;s hands in hers 
and pulled the duchess down to the cabins.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you show me your 
talent?&quot;
 
Haruka remembered thinking how lucky she was to have found Michiru.
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
Haruka closed the door and smiled at the nymph of a Duchess hanging onto 
her hand.  Smiling, she pulled the smaller woman into her arms and very 
gently kissed her on the edge of her pink lips, smiling when Michiru 
leaned closer, desperate for more.  &quot;Not yet,&quot; she whispered, enjoying 
the feeling of control.  &quot;Later.  Tonight we&#39;ll go slow.&quot;  She leaned in 
again, letting Michiru pull her into a deep, loving kiss, the smaller 
woman&#39;s hands searching . . . finding Haruka&#39;s round breasts, cupping 
them and squeezing, delighting in the older woman&#39;s gasp.  Haruka 
growled, long fingers searching for the strings that bound Michiru&#39;s 
dress.  Finding them, she watched with one eye as the soft fabric fell 
to the floor, revealing a very thin silky under-dress, which followed 
the heavier material an instant later.  Michiru shivered as Haruka 
guided her backwards, laying her on the bed and pulling back, completely 
in control.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;You&#39;re just so beautiful,&quot; Haruka whispered, running a finger down 
Michiru&#39;s cheek.  That hand continued lower, stopping to play with 
Michiru&#39;s pink nipples before dipping between her white legs.  Michiru 
gasped, arching her back, as Haruka&#39;s hand disappeared, long fingers 
searching for her lover&#39;s sensitive clit.  Haruka grinned as Michiru 
pulled back; found it.  Pushing deeper, she gasped as she entered the 
younger woman, the warmth shocking her.  She hadn&#39;t had much time to 
herself in the Arena, but she hadn&#39;t wasted the opportunity to explore 
her body.  &quot;You&#39;re so hot,&quot; she groaned, pushing deeper, meeting the 
tight resistance of a virgin.  &quot;And tight.&quot;  Michiru groaned and Haruka 
pulled back.  &quot;Am I hurting you?&quot;
 
Michiru shook her head.  &quot;No . . . it just feels so good . . . please 
don&#39;t stop.&quot;
 
&quot;Never.&quot;  Haruka reentered the nymph, watching as Michiru jerked, hands 
reaching for Haruka&#39;s breasts.  Haruka let her fumble with the tunic as 
she moved higher on the bed, straddling Michiru&#39;s long legs as she 
thrust again and again.  Some old, buried memory surfaced, telling her 
what to do, how to make the woman really squirm.  Smiling, Haruka pulled 
her finger out and watched Michiru as she licked the woman&#39;s juices off.  
She tasted . . . different.  There really wasn&#39;t any way to describe it.  
She tasted good.  That was enough; it didn&#39;t have to be explained.  
Ignoring her lover&#39;s frustrated whine, Haruka leaned down and covered 
her tiny pink nipple with her lips.  Michiru groaned, amazed that such a 
simple action could feel so damn good.  She caught her breath long 
enough to be amazed that a woman could make her feel such amazing 
sensations, the tiniest pinpricks of pain transformed into the greatest 
waves of warmth, pleasure, feelings she couldn&#39;t fully describe.  She 
wanted to make Haruka feel that . . .
 
Haruka caught Michiru&#39;s hands as they reached for her partially-covered 
breasts.  &quot;No touching,&quot; she whispered.  &quot;Just lay back, koibito, relax, 
and enjoy.  I remember how to do this properly.&quot;
 
&quot;Remember,&quot; Michiru echoed.  &quot;Remember, Ruka?  From when we were 
Senshi?&quot;  She was silenced, her curiosity stilled, as Haruka&#39;s lips 
covered hers, agile tongue delving, tasting, caressing.  She sucked 
gently, smiling as Haruka moaned, her hands caressing Michiru&#39;s smooth 
skin.  Pulling back, Haruka let her tongue travel the path her fingers 
had drawn, pausing to gently suckle each hard nipple before traveling 
even lower, gently spreading Michiru&#39;s legs.  The Duchess gasped, biting 
her lip, as Haruka&#39;s talented tongue slipped inside her, finding 
pleasure points only a long-time lover should know.  They had been 
lovers in a previous life&#151;they had to have been.  All thoughts fled as 
Haruka searched deeper, one hand holding Michiru open, the other rubbing 
circles around her clit.  Michiru began to twitch, the motions becoming 
more violent as each touch sent waves of unimaginable pleasure through 
her, pushing her higher and higher until she didn&#39;t think she could 
stand it anymore.  Just before she exploded, died, fell over the edge, 
it stopped, Haruka pulling back, feeling the wetness in her own pants.

Michiru moaned, reaching for her lover.  &quot;Please don&#39;t stop,&quot; she 
whispered, begging, pleading, too horny and desperate to care how she 
sounded.
 
&quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; Haruka assured her, amused at the woman&#39;s reaction.  Somehow, 
she had expected it.  Suiting action to word, Haruka carefully and 
slowly slipped two long fingers into her lover, making sure she didn&#39;t 
hurt the woman.  Curling her fingers and twisting her wrist, she grinned 
as Michiru&#39;s half-scream filled the room, arching almost off the bed.  
Haruka grinned as she quickly brought Michiru back to the edge, sensing 
her own orgasm near.  She was going to come if Michiru did, she was sure 
of it.  Leaning down, Haruka gently kissed the smooth, warm, sensitive 
skin around Michiru&#39;s clit and bit her.  Hard.  That time Michiru really 
did scream, nearly knocking Haruka off the bed, her juices covering her 
lover&#39;s hand and face, soaking the sheets.  Haruka groaned as she shook 
with the force of a much less powerful orgasm, crawling up and 
half-covering her shaking lover, lending the smaller woman her warmth as 
she ripped her soaked pants off and dropped them on the floor.
 
&quot;Are you okay?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Michiru whispered, a smile spreading across her face.  &quot;Better 
than ever before.  How did you know what to do?&quot;
 
&quot;I just did.  We&#39;ve danced this waltz before, koibito.  Can&#39;t you feel 
the connection?&quot;
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Michiru admitted, smiling.  &quot;I can.&quot;  She reached up and slipped 
Haruka&#39;s tunic off, dropping it on the floor as she pushed the older 
woman onto her back.  &quot;Let&#39;s see how much I remember, shall we?&quot;
 
Haruka rested her hands on Michiru&#39;s back, watching as the smaller woman 
attacked her breasts, nipping and sucking, roughly kneading the soft 
flesh, Haruka groaning at the sensations.  She caught Michiru&#39;s hands, 
pulling the woman up for a kiss to save her aching breasts.  &quot;You really 
like them . . .&quot; she murmured.
 
&quot;More than I could explain.  I don&#39;t even know why . . . breasts are my 
favorite.&quot;  She returned her mouth to one breast as her hand wasted no 
time slipping between Haruka&#39;s strong thighs.  She slipped inside, 
marveling at the warmth she found, trying to thrust as hard as Haruka 
had been able to.  But she wasn&#39;t the strong, seasoned warrior the Arena 
had turned her lover into, and the muscles in her arm protested her 
speed.  She pushed herself up, trying to change the pace, but Haruka 
reached out and caught her arm.
 
&quot;It&#39;s okay, Michi,&quot; she whispered, pulling the woman&#39;s hand free.  &quot;I 
know that you&#39;re tired.  Just relax, okay?&quot;
 
&quot;But I didn&#39;t . . . I couldn&#39;t . . .&quot;
 
Haruka pulled Michiru into her arms and kissed her gently.  &quot;I already 
came, Michi.  I came when you did.  There&#39;ll be plenty of time to try 
later, maybe later tonight.  For now, just relax.&quot;
 
&quot;I love you so much,&quot; Michiru murmured, closing her sapphire eyes as 
Haruka pulled a warm blanket up to cover them both.  &quot;I feel like I 
always have.&quot;
 
&quot;I know.  I love you, too, and I always will.  Go to sleep now, my 
little nymph.&quot;
 
*~*~*~*~*~*~*
 
She was so warm and content.  She couldn&#39;t remember ever waking up 
feeling so . . . right.  Michiru sighed as she rolled over, gasping as 
her muscles complained.  Opening her eyes, she reached out to caress her 
sleeping lover, savoring the word.  They belonged to each other, and 
Michiru could no longer deny that.  Haruka had never even tried.  The 
blonde stirred at the soft caress, opening her amazing emerald eyes and 
smiling.  &quot;Good morning.&quot;
 
&quot;I think it&#39;s afternoon,&quot; Michiru chuckled.  &quot;We slept through morning.&quot;
 
&quot;Can you blame us?  We were up all night.&quot;
 
&quot;Kami-sama, Ruka; we kept the ship up all night.&quot;
 
&quot;They&#39;re just jealous.&quot;  Haruka stretched, groaning, and Michiru laughed 
at the expression on her face.  &quot;Oh my . . . I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve been 
this sore since my first fights at the arena.  You are quite an 
opponent, love.&quot;
 
&quot;I&#39;d prefer to think of myself as a partner.  And you&#39;re quite a handful 
yourself, Wind Dancer.&quot;
 
&quot;That&#39;s really sweet.&quot;  Haruka leaned over Michiru and kissed her 
gently, letting her hand trail down the smaller woman&#39;s body, soothing 
the slight aches she knew the woman was feeling.  &quot;Michi, tell me 
something.&quot;
 
&quot;Anything, Ruka.&quot;
 
&quot;Do you love me?  Really love me?&quot;
 
Michiru sat up, albeit painfully, and cupped Haruka&#39;s chin in her hand.  
&quot;Ruka, I love you more than my life.  You showed me that I can be myself 
and drop all of my pretenses and lies and the shields I built to keep 
others out.  No matter what my mother and father say, I can be me.  
That&#39;s the greatest gift anyone could give me.  When I thought you chose 
Mako-chan, I was so upset.  It was worse than being alone.  Then you 
said that you wanted me, and my life found new meaning.  Ruka, if what I 
feel for you isn&#39;t love, than I don&#39;t know what is.&quot;
 
Haruka wiped the tears out of her eyes, pulling Michiru into her arms.  
&quot;I don&#39;t think I could have said that any better myself.  I love you, 
Michiru.  I never thought I&#39;d get the chance.  I don&#39;t know what I would 
have done if you didn&#39;t rescue me from that arena.&quot;
 
&quot;Neither do I,&quot; the sea senshi purred, snuggling back into her lover&#39;s 
arms.  &quot;I wonder if anyone will remember to come get us.&quot;
 
A loud knock on the door interrupted their conversation, and both looked 
up as Rei burst into the room, beaming at the couple as she jumped onto 
the bed, nudging the door closed as she leapt.  &quot;Hey!  Look at you two!  
It certainly took you long enough!&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan!  What are you doing?&quot;
 
Rei grinned at the blushing duchess, smiling at Haruka.  &quot;I wanted to 
see if I was dreaming last night.  Kami-sama, you two were loud!  Both 
virgins, huh?&quot;  Michiru blushed, and Rei patted her on the cheek.  
&quot;Don&#39;t worry, we all started somewhere.  Even Minako had a first time.  
A long, long time ago.&quot;
 
&quot;And you?&quot;
 
&quot;Who do you think Minako had her first time with?&quot;  Rei laughed as she 
stretched out on top of the blanket, lying between the two lovers.  
&quot;Well, did you have fun?&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan, you sure are nosy.  Minako-chan never mentioned this side of 
you.&quot;
 
&quot;She probably also never mentioned that she and I refuse to let Setsuna 
sleep alone when she wanders down our way.&quot;
 
Michiru blushed at the thought, and Haruka laughed.  &quot;I knew there was 
something between the two of you!  Why are you telling us now?&quot;
 
&quot;I was waiting for you two to hook up.  Minako never goes for attached 
women, though married men might catch her eye now and then.  I know of a 
couple of engagements she&#39;s broken.  As long as you two are lovers and 
comfortable with being a couple, she won&#39;t mess with you.&quot;
 
&quot;You were protecting us from your girlfriend?&quot;
 
Rei nodded.  &quot;She&#39;s pretty feisty.  You&#39;ll like her, though; she&#39;s very 
sweet.  So, when are you gonna&#39; get married?&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan!  Out!  That is enough of your speculations!&quot;  Michiru dumped 
Rei on the floor and crossed her arms over her chest, glaring until the 
miko bowed and slipped out of the room.
 
&quot;Good luck,&quot; she whispered before she closed the door.
 
Michiru smiled at Haruka.  &quot;She&#39;s not usually that feisty and 
energetic.&quot;
 
&quot;I have never seen her like that,&quot; Haruka murmured.  &quot;She was always so 
calm and quiet at the Arena.  Maybe because she was busy plotting our 
escape.  Is this Minako-san anything like Rei-chan?&quot;
 
Michiru laughed and glanced at the closet, contemplating clothes and 
food.  &quot;She&#39;s a lot more energetic.  She doesn&#39;t ever have a gloomy 
moment.  She reminds me a lot of our princess, which may be appropriate 
since they are cousins.&quot;
 
&quot;Will we meet her soon?&quot;
 
&quot;Rei-chan wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.  Now that I think about it, 
I&#39;m glad we&#39;ll be able to visit all of the Regions before returning to 
Tokyo and the queen.  You&#39;re a lot more confidant and happy than you 
were when I picked you and Mako-chan up.  This trip has done you a world 
of good, and you want to be at your best when we get to the Silver 
Palace.&quot;  She slipped out of bed and reached for an appropriate dress, 
glancing at her lazy lover.  &quot;Though if we keep this up much longer, the 
crew will murder us for want of a good night&#39;s sleep and you&#39;ll never 
meet the princess.&quot;
 
Haruka grinned.  &quot;Let &#39;em try.&quot;
 
&quot;Haruka!  You&#39;re impossible!  What am I going to do with you?&quot;
 
&quot;Would you like to come over and find out?&quot;</pre>
