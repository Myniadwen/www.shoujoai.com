<h1>Twas the Night Before Christmas</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/amazonessduo.html">Amazoness Quartet</a><br> </h2>
<pre>This is a Christmas themed story. Hotaru &amp; ChibiUsa are both 15 and Kakyuu
&amp; the Starlights are 19. Every space between paragraphs is a scene change.
Usagi and Mamoru are married and share an apartment, so ChibiUsa stays 
with Usagi&#39;s parents and Shingo. A lot of our story ideas come from an
IRL Sailormoon roleplaying game we play, and some of the ideas in this 
fic also come from that. One day we may write down the basics of what goes 
on in our role-playing game, but only if people are interested. If you have 
any ideas about who we should get Seiya and Taiki with, we&#39;d really like 
to hear from you. We love feedback, so please e-mail us.

We love to hear from people and what they thought of our stories or what
stories they&#39;d like us to write.  Thanks. ^-^

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The city of Tokyo was blanketed in a layer of snow. All was calm 
and peaceful...
	&quot;Come on, Taiki. I don&#39;t have all day,&quot; Yaten complained as Taiki
ignored him and continued to look around the book store.
	&quot;It&#39;s not Taiki&#39;s fault you didn&#39;t get Kakyuu a Christmas present
yet,&quot; said Seiya.
	&quot;I just kept putting it off. You guys know how much I hate Christmas
shopping,&quot; said Yaten.
	&quot;That doesn&#39;t matter. You should have gotten this done a while back
so you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about it now,&quot; Taiki spoke up from one of the
books she was looking at.
	&quot;Well, thanks for going with me, but could we look at some other 
stores? This place sucks,&quot; said Yaten. Taiki looked up from her books and 
glared at her. &quot;I mean, I can&#39;t find a gift for Kakyuu here.&quot;
	&quot;Yeah, we should probably be going if Yaten&#39;s going to get anything 
in time,&quot; said Seiya.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry. I&#39;ll be done in a couple minutes,&quot; said Taiki. Yaten
and Seiya looked at each other. When Taiki was in a bookstore it could be 
days before they saw daylight again.
	Several minutes later, Taiki turned around to find that Seiya and 
Yaten were gone. &#39;Oh well,&#39; Taiki thought, &#39;that gives me more time to find-
the books I want.&#39; Taiki turned back around and continued to look through 
the shelves of books.

	ChibiUsa sat alone in the Tsukino household. She looked outside at 
the snow as the weather seemed to get worse. She sighed. Earlier, she had 
found out that Usagi&#39;s parents, Kenji &amp; Ikuko, and her brother Shingo were
stuck because of the snow, so they had to stay at a friend of the family&#39;s
house. They had been going to a dinner part and had asked ChibiUsa if she
wanted to go, but she declined. Usagi and Mamoru had called to see if she
was okay a short while ago. Mamoru had offered to go get her, but it would
have been dangerous in the blizzard.
	ChibiUsa remembered the Christmases she had spent in Crystal Tokyo 
with her family. She remembered getting a tree with her parents, having
big dinners with the other Senshi, looking at all the decorations people 
would put up around the Crystal Palace... She sighed again. She missed 
those times. She had tried to call Hotaru several times, but a little 
while after Usagi &amp; Mamoru called the phone lines had gone out. Just to
hear her sweet voice would make ChibiUsa feel better and less homesick.
	ChibiUsa held the present she had gotten for Hotaru. She had wanted
to give it to her that day, but now she&#39;d have to wait until it stopped
snowing, if it did at all. &#39;I hate this,&#39; thought ChibiUsa. &#39;It&#39;s Christmas
Eve and I can&#39;t spend it with my loved ones. I can&#39;t spend it with my mom
and dad since they&#39;re in the future. Usagi&#39;s family can&#39;t get here. And 
Hotaru&#39;s spending Christmas with Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna. I can&#39;t 
even go see her because of the snow.&#39; ChibiUsa sat closer to the fire. She
was wearing a shirt and some sweatpants to keep warm, but it didn&#39;t help 
much with how cold it was. She had started a fire earlier to keep warm, 
and it seemed to be heating up the room rather well. 
	She started to think about Hotaru, as she often did when she 
couldn&#39;t be with her. She thought about how Hotaru&#39;s dark hair fell to her
shoulders. How Hotaru&#39;s purple eyes would stare deep into her own. She 
could spend hours looking into Hotaru&#39;s eyes. How Hotaru&#39;s soft lips felt
against her own. ChibiUsa blushed. She remembered how they had almost been 
caught kissing right before class. ChibiUsa smiled to herself at the memory. 
&quot;I wish she was here,&quot; said ChibiUsa aloud as she thought of the dark 
haired girl.

	Seiya and Yaten walked along inside the mall. &quot;So do you have any 
idea what you want to get Kakyuu?&quot; asked Seiya.
	&quot;I have no clue. I just want to get her something she&#39;ll like,&quot; 
said Yaten.
	Seiya shrugged. &quot;Good luck. I don&#39;t really think she&#39;ll mind no 
matter what you get her. She has you and that&#39;s what keeps her happy.&quot;
	Yaten smiled. &quot;Thanks, Seiya. You&#39;re right. I still want to get
her something special, though.&quot;
	The two walked along in relative silence for a while. Finally 
Yaten spoke up. &quot;Lets go in here.&quot; Yaten indicated a store. Its sign read 
that it had unique merchandise.
	&quot;What&#39;s &#39;unique merchandise&#39;? asked Seiya.
	&quot;Let&#39;s find out. Maybe I can find something for Kakyuu here,&quot; 
Yaten said as she walked into the store.
	Yaten and Seiya froze as they looked at the people in the store.
They were all dressed up in costumes of the senshi. And they were all men.
Seiya and Yaten looked along the line of costumed senshi. Some had beards, 
or goatees, or receding hairlines. Seiya and Yaten&#39;s gaze stopped as they 
saw the Starlights. Yaten and Seiya ran screaming from the store.

	ChibiUsa blinked several times. She must have fallen asleep by the 
fire. She stretched a bit as she sat up. She heard a knock at the door. 
&#39;That must be what woke me up,&#39; thought ChibiUsa. She got up and walked 
towards the door. &#39;Who could it be?&#39; she thought. She stood on her tiptoes
and looked out the peephole. Hotaru was standing outside. ChibiUsa quickly 
unlocked the door. 
	&quot;Hotaru, what are you doing here? You look frozen. How did you get 
here? You didn&#39;t walk all the way did you? Do the others know you&#39;re 
here?&quot; asked ChibiUsa. Hotaru just smiled slightly and let ChibiUsa lead
her inside. 
	&quot;I wanted to see you,&quot; she said simply.
	&quot;Oh, Hotaru. You shouldn&#39;t have come all this way through the snow.
It&#39;s dangerous,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Are you happy to see me?&quot; Hotaru leaned towards ChibiUsa and smiled
again. ChibiUsa kissed her. She felt ChibiUsa&#39;s warm lips against her own 
cold ones. &#39;It was worth it. I love being with her. I should have gone 
earlier,&#39; she thought as ChibiUsa&#39;s tongue entered her mouth. Both girls 
finally pulled away from lack of breath. 
	&quot;Thank you, Hotaru. I was feeling so lonely all by myself. And 
homesick. I wanted to see you so badly,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	Hotaru brushed some of ChibiUsa&#39;s hair away from her eyes. &quot;I missed
you, too.&quot;
	&quot;You&#39;re shivering,&quot; said ChibiUsa. &quot;You must be freezing. Let me 
help you.&quot; ChibiUsa helped Hotaru out of her clothes and then went off to 
get a blanket. Hotaru sat by the fire and waited for ChibiUsa. &#39;She really
worries about me. It feels so good to have someone like that. ChibiUsa&#39;s not 
even born yet, but she&#39;s my other half,&#39; Hotaru thought. ChibiUsa came back 
and put the blanket around her. 
	&quot;I&#39;m going to make some hot cocoa. I&#39;ll be back in just a minute,&quot; 
said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Okay. But you better hurry. I may not be here when you get back,&quot;
Hotaru said mischievously. ChibiUsa smiled at her and walked off to make 
the cocoa. &#39;It&#39;s nice to know that someone cares for you like she does. 
She&#39;s really cute when she worries about me, too. I have a lot of fun when
I&#39;m around her. It&#39;s like she brings out a part of me that no one else sees
but her,&#39; thought Hotaru.
	
	&quot;I&#39;m telling you, Taiki. They looked like bikers,&quot; said Yaten.
	&quot;They looked like the Hell&#39;s Angels in senshi fuku,&quot; agreed Seiya.
	&quot;It&#39;s ironic, though, isn&#39;t it? We dress up like men as normal 
people,&quot; said Taiki.
	&quot;Not normal people. We&#39;re the Three Lights, remember?&quot; answered 
Seiya.
	&quot;That&#39;s besides the point. We dress up like men, though as senshi 
you can see we&#39;re women, and they dress up like women as senshi,&quot; said 
Taiki.
	&quot;Though as biker trash you can see that they&#39;re men. That doesn&#39;t
really matter, Taiki. It was still a scary sight,&quot; said Yaten.
	They walked along silently for a little while. 
	&quot;Ironic, nonetheless,&quot; said Taiki.	

	ChibiUsa walked back to Hotaru holding a mug of hot cocoa. She 
handed it to Hotaru who accepted it gratefully. ChibiUsa sat down by her.
She hugged her knees to her chest. ChibiUsa turned to her and smiled. &quot;I&#39;m 
really glad you&#39;re here, Hotaru.&quot;
	&quot;I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here, too. Thanks for the cocoa, Odango-chan,&quot; Hotaru 
said, pulling the blanket tighter around herself. 
	&quot;That&#39;s okay. I hope you like it. I know I can&#39;t cook very well,&quot; 
She was interrupted by a giggle from Hotaru, &quot;but I tried, anyway.&quot;
	&quot;Odango-chan, its easy to make cocoa. You don&#39;t have to do too much.
How could you mess that up?&quot; Hotaru asked.
	&quot;Oh, I&#39;d find some way. That&#39;s the last thing I need. You get here 
and then I poison you with bad hot cocoa,&quot; said ChibiUsa.
	Hotaru took a sip. &quot;It&#39;s pretty good,&quot; she said. She felt the warmth
go through her body as she drank a little more. She noticed that it wasn&#39;t 
the cocoa that was warming her up, though. It was ChibiUsa&#39;s hands on her 
shoulders, trying to rub some warmth back into her cold body. Hotaru purred
as she felt ChibiUsa&#39;s breath against the back of her neck. 
	&quot;So how are Michiru, Haruka, and Setsuna?&quot; asked ChibiUsa. One of 
her hands started to go lower, sending a tingle up Hotaru&#39;s spine.
	&quot;They&#39;re doing pretty well. They were doing a lot of cooking before 
I left. Haruka accidentally set something on fire and they kicked her out of 
the kitchen,&quot; Hotaru said.
	&quot;Haruka&#39;s almost as bad as I am when it comes to cooking,&quot; said 
ChibiUsa.
	&quot;No, she&#39;s worse. Michiru-mama tries to help her, but something 
always goes wrong when Haruka-papa&#39;s cooking. She really tries to help, 
too,&quot; said Hotaru. She felt ChibiUsa&#39;s hands rubbing her back. &#39;I&#39;m in 
heaven right now, she thought to herself. The blanket slid past her 
shoulders. ChibiUsa felt a thrill race through her as she smelt the 
fragrant scent of Hotaru&#39;s hair. 
	&quot;There. Are you feeling warmer now, Hotaru?&quot; asked ChibiUsa. Hotaru
turned around so she was facing ChibiUsa. Hotaru&#39;s arms encircled ChibiUsa.
Her breasts pressed up against ChibiUsa&#39;s through her shirt. 
	&quot;ChibiUsa, you warmed my life more than you&#39;ll ever know,&quot; Hotaru 
said. ChibiUsa blushed as she looked into Hotaru&#39;s eyes, as she had thought
about doing earlier. 

	&quot;I can&#39;t find anything,&quot; complained Yaten.
	&quot;We&#39;ve been around the mall and back twice now,&quot; said Taiki. &quot;You&#39;d 
think that you could find something by now.&quot;
	&quot;I guess we better head home,&quot; said Yaten, defeated.
	&quot;In that case, I&#39;m going back to get one last book. I&#39;ll see you two
in a minute,&quot; Taiki walked off.
	Yaten sat near a fountain, angry at herself for not finding anything.
Seiya sat down by her. After a couple minutes of contemplation, Seiya turned
towards Yaten. 
	&quot;I know what you can give Kakyuu,&quot; said Seiya.
	&quot;What?&quot; asked Yaten.
	Seiya pulled something out of her pocket. She held it in front of 
Yaten. It was a small fire red jewel with a ring of gold around it. 
	&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Yaten as she looked at it.
	&quot;It&#39;s a piece of jewelry from Kinmoku. I found it right before we 
went to earth. I was going to give it to Kakyuu when I told her how I really
felt about her. But you won her heart. I want you to give this to Kakyuu,&quot;
Seiya handed it to Yaten. &#39;First I lost Usagi, and now Kakyuu,&#39; thought 
Seiya. &#39;I have really bad luck with women.&#39;
	&quot;Thanks, Seiya,&quot; said Yaten in a low voice as she looked at it. 
&quot;She&#39;ll love it, especially since it&#39;s from Kinmoku.&quot;
	&quot;Hey, don&#39;t worry about it. As long as she has you, she&#39;ll be happy. 
As long as she&#39;s happy, I&#39;m fine,&quot; said Seiya. &quot;Now let&#39;s go get a store to 
wrap it.&quot;

	Hotaru &amp; ChibiUsa held each other, the blanket forgotten on the 
floor. Hotaru leaned her head on ChibiUsa&#39;s chest. &quot;I wish you&#39;d let me 
tell everyone about us,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;I know, but we&#39;re both pretty young. People will think we&#39;re doing 
something stupid,&quot; said ChibiUsa
	&quot;I don&#39;t care what they think about us. I just want everyone to know
that you&#39;re my Odango-chan,&quot; replied Hotaru. &quot;As it is, all the boys see you
as a pretty single girl and they try to get you. I want them to know that 
you already have a girlfriend.&quot;
	ChibiUsa laughed. &quot;Maybe I should just wear an &quot;I&#39;m gay with Hotaru&quot;
sticker on my blouse.&quot;
	&quot;Maybe. Then I wouldn&#39;t have to worry about boys talking to you,&quot; 
said Hotaru as she kissed ChibiUsa lightly.
	&quot;Then you&#39;d only have to worry about the girls chasing after me,&quot;
said ChibiUsa.
	&quot;Why do I doubt that? Anyway, that&#39;s why the sticker would say 
&#39;with Hotaru&#39;&quot; said Hotaru with a smile.
	&quot;Oh yeah? Momo-chan&#39;s had her eye on me for a while,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;I&#39;m sure all the other girls in the school do. But they can&#39;t have 
you. I wouldn&#39;t let them,&quot; Hotaru said as their lips brushed again. 
	ChibiUsa brushed some hair out of Hotaru&#39;s eyes. &quot;I love you,&quot; she 
said simply, looking deep into those purple eyes that drew her in.

	Taiki had caught up with Yaten and Seiya after they had gotten 
Kakyuu&#39;s gift wrapped. 
	&quot;Are we ready to go?&quot; asked Seiya.
	&quot;I suppose we are,&quot; answered Taiki. They pushed open the mall doors 
and looked out at the falling snow outside.
	&quot;We&#39;ll never be able to get back,&quot; said Seiya.
	&quot;Well, we&#39;ll have to try anyway,&quot; said Yaten determinedly. She 
started walking out of the mall, bracing herself against the still falling
snow. &quot;Are you two coming or not?&quot;
	Taiki and Seiya exchanged glances before heading outside. They 
walked along for a while, but they started to have trouble finding where
they were going. They saw a silhouette of a man in front of them. He waved.
	&quot;Follow me!&quot; he said as he started off.
	&quot;What do we do?&quot; asked Seiya.
	&quot;We follow him. What else can we do.&quot; replied Taiki.
	&quot;Who&#39;s stupid idea was it to head out here anyway?&quot; asked Yaten. 
Taiki and Seiya both slapped her upside the head. Suddenly, the snow was 
blocked a bit. They were in an alleyway with a bunch of ragged men 
surrounding a fire barrel.
	&quot;Hi. I&#39;m Hobo Willie. It&#39;s nice to meet you,&quot; The man who had helped 
them stuck out his hand which was covered in a ripped white glove. Taiki took
his hand and shook it. 
	&quot;It&#39;s good to meet you too, sir. Thanks for helping us,&quot; Taiki said.
	&quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Are you fancy lads hungry? We&#39;re cooking....&quot;
He looked at what the other bums and hobos were cooking over the fire. &quot;I 
don&#39;t know what the hell we&#39;re cooking, but it is food. I think.&quot;
	&quot;No! I&#39;m in hell with a bunch of hobo&#39;s and I won&#39;t be with my 
Kakyuu for Christmas!&quot; said an exasperated Yaten.
	&quot;You forgot bums, fancy lad,&quot; Hobo Willie added helpfully.

	Hotaru &amp; ChibiUsa&#39;s hands started to roam each other&#39;s bodies. 
ChibiUsa felt Hotaru&#39;s hands cup her breasts. She felt her nipples 
harden as Hotaru pinched them lightly through the cloth of her shirt. 
ChibiUsa slid out of the sweatpants she was wearing as Hotaru pulled
ChibiUsa&#39;s shirt off. ChibiUsa sat on her knees as she and Hotaru looked
at each other. She placed her hands on Hotaru&#39;s shoulders and gently 
pushed her to the floor. 
	&quot;Odango-chan, you are so beautiful,&quot; said Hotaru as she traced the 
curves of ChibiUsa&#39;s body. ChibiUsa blushed. She crawled over towards 
Hotaru. One hand moved between Hotaru&#39;s legs. ChibiUsa crawled up further 
so her face was inches away from Hotaru&#39;s. Hotaru looked at ChibiUsa&#39;s 
flushed cheeks. &#39;She&#39;s still a bit embarrassed about our making love&#39; 
Hotaru thought. &#39;She&#39;s not used to being close to someone like we are. I&#39;m
not either, but I cherish every moment I have with her. I want to make 
sure she&#39;s not embarrassed around me&#39;. Hotaru leaned her head closer to 
ChibiUsa as her hands went to ChibiUsa&#39;s chest. Her mouth met ChibiUsa&#39;s. 
ChibiUsa almost pulled away at the suddenness of it, but
she pushed back into the kiss, letting Hotaru&#39;s tongue enter her mouth. &#39;I 
am so lucky to have her&#39; thought ChibiUsa. &#39;She always makes me feel safe.&#39; 
Hotaru felt ChibiUsa&#39;s fingers slide into her. Hotaru continued to kiss 
ChibiUsa as she felt her fingers slide further into her. They pulled away 
from the kiss breathlessly.
	Hotaru&#39;s hand ran across ChibiUsa&#39;s stomach and through her pink 
pubic hair. ChibiUsa loved the way Hotaru&#39;s body felt against hers. ChibiUsa 
spread her legs. ChibiUsa moaned as Hotaru&#39;s fingers started to stroke her
pearl. Hotaru started kissing along ChibiUsa&#39;s neck. She felt herself 
near orgasm as she felt one of ChibiUsa&#39;s hands exploring the curves of her
body. Both girls moaned the others name as they reached orgasm together. 
They laid on the floor for a while panting. ChibiUsa kissed Hotaru&#39;s damp
forehead. ChibiUsa got off of Hotaru and grabbed the blanket. Hotaru pulled 
ChibiUsa close as ChibiUsa brought the blanket around them. 

	Taiki looked at the hobos and bums as they threw their Christmas eve 
party. &quot;They have nothing, yet they still enjoy Christmas.&quot;
	&quot;And they invite us to stay for the party,&quot; said Seiya.
	Hobo Willie sat down by Yaten. &quot;Are you okay, fancy lad? You don&#39;t 
look too happy. Are you hungry?&quot; he asked.
	&quot;Look, thanks for everything, but it&#39;s Christmas Eve and the only 
thing I want is to be back with my Kakyuu,&quot; said Yaten.
	Hobo Willie stared off into space for several minutes. Yaten looked
at him quizzically. She waved her hand in his line of vision. 
	&quot;Hmm, wha.. Oh, yeah. I lost track of what I was thinking about. Are 
you hungry?&quot; he asked again. 
	Yaten sweatdropped. &quot;No, I&#39;m not. I just want to get home, somehow,&quot; 
Yaten said.
	Hobo Willie looked at Yaten for a moment, then nodded his head. 
&quot;That kinda sucks, doesn&#39;t it. I&#39;d like to get home, too, but my cardboard
box is across town.&quot;
	&quot;Do you have any ideas on how I could get home?&quot; Yaten asked 
desperately.
	&quot;Oh, yeah. I have some of those,&quot; Hobo Willie said.
	Yaten sweatdropped again. &quot;Could you tell me them?&quot; she asked.
	&quot;Now that&#39;s a good idea right there,&quot; He answered. He got up and 
walked towards the fire barrel. 
	&#39;Well there goes the chance of getting help. I knew I shouldn&#39;t put 
my hope in some bum,&#39; she thought.
	&quot;Okay everybody. Listen up,&quot; Hobo Willie said. &quot;It&#39;s Christmas Eve
and someone&#39;s very unhappy. If there&#39;s anything we can do to help someone&#39;s
Christmas, we should. I say we help these fancy lads get home!&quot; Many hobos
and bums started yelling agreement. Yaten looked up as she heard that. These
people had nothing, yet they wanted to help.
	&quot;We should get going now if you want to get home in time,&quot; Hobo 
Willie said.
	&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Yaten.
	&quot;Yeah,&quot; agreed Seiya. 
	&quot;That&#39;s very kind of you,&quot; said Taiki.
	&quot;Think nothing of it,&quot; Hobo Willie said. &quot;Now all we&#39;ve got to do is
find some reindeer.&quot;
	Yaten, Seiya, and Taiki sweatdropped.

	&quot;Odango-chan?&quot; asked Hotaru.
	&quot;Yeah, Hotaru?&quot; ChibiUsa looked at the other girl.
	&quot;Guess,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;What?&quot; asked ChibiUsa.
	&quot;I love you,&quot; said Hotaru.
	They kissed before ChibiUsa got up. &quot;Just a minute. I wanted to give 
you something,&quot; she said.
	Hotaru walked over to her clothes. She pulled her present to ChibiUsa
out of her jacket. She turned around to see ChibiUsa walking towards her. 
ChibiUsa sat down by her. 
	&quot;This is for you. Merry Christmas, Hotaru,&quot; said ChibiUsa as she handed
Hotaru her gift.
	&quot;Merry Christmas, ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru said as she exchanged gifts with her
Odango-chan.
	&quot;What is it?&quot; asked ChibiUsa. 
	&quot;Open it,&quot; Hotaru said.
	&quot;No, I want you to open your present first,&quot; ChibiUsa said.
	&quot;Okay. We&#39;ll open it at the same time,&quot; said Hotaru.
	ChibiUsa and Hotaru started to unwrap their gifts. 
	&quot;Oh, Hotaru, it&#39;s beautiful,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She looked at the locket 
Hotaru had gotten her. She opened it and saw a picture of herself with Hotaru.
	&quot;Thank you, ChibiUsa,&quot; Hotaru said as she looked at her gift. It was a 
small porcelain doll, with shoulder length dark purple hair. It was just like 
a doll she had when she was growing up. 
	&quot;I remembered that you had a doll like that from a little while after we 
became friends. You told me all about it and how it was one of the only things 
you had of your mom&#39;s. Then it got possessed by a Daimon and destroyed by the 
outer senshi. You looked so sad. I found this a while ago and I had to get it
for you,&quot; said ChibiUsa. She and Hotaru met in a warm embrace.

	Yaten, Seiya, and Taiki walked along with Hobo Willie guiding them. For
a minute the old man looked like Santa Claus, though Taiki rationalized it was
probably from their poor vision.
	&quot;He seems kinda like old Saint Nick, doesn&#39;t he?&quot; asked Seiya.
	&quot;Yeah. An old Saint Nick who lost his job... and his mind,&quot; remarked 
Yaten. 
	&quot;It&#39;s still nice that he&#39;s helping us get home,&quot; said Taiki.
	&quot;Grab that!&quot; yelled Hobo Willie.
	Seiya looked up just in time to see a cardboard box flying at her. 
&quot;AAaaaahhhhhh!&quot; Seiya reflexively grabbed the box before it hit her.
	&quot;Oh, good. You caught my house. I guess it wasn&#39;t as far across town as
I thought,&quot; said Hobo Willie. He pulled the box away from Seiya and folded it up.
&quot;Don&#39;t you just love these new fangled mobile homes?&quot; 
	They walked along through the snow until they reached a big building. 
	&quot;Well, here you go. I believe this is your building,&quot; he said.
	&quot;Thank you. I&#39;d hug you if you weren&#39;t a scary old hobo,&quot; Yaten said 
happily as she shook his had and ran in to find Kakyuu.
	&quot;Oh, what the hell,&quot; Seiya said and hugged the old man. Seiya followed
Yaten in.
	&quot;Thanks again,&quot; said Taiki. &quot;Is there anything we could do for you?&quot;
	&quot;Nah, Not unless you have parts to an edsel. There&#39;s a broken down one 
in the dump, and I&#39;d be hell on wheels if I could get it to work,&quot; Hobo Willie
said.
	Taiki stared at him for a moment. &quot;Here&#39;s some money. Use it for 
whatever you want. Merry Christmas.&quot;
	&quot;C&#39;mon Taiki. You&#39;re smart,&quot; said Yaten sticking her head around the
corner. &quot;He&#39;s just going to buy booze with it.&quot;
	&quot;Now there&#39;s a good idea,&quot; said Hobo Willie.
	Taiki walked inside as the Hobo walked off through the snow.
	Yaten opened the door to their apartment and Kakyuu threw herself 
into the other girls arms. 
	&quot;Oh Yaten. I was so worried about you,&quot; said Kakyuu. &quot;Don&#39;t scare me 
like that. I missed you.&quot; Yaten kissed Kakyuu.
	&quot;I wish I had somebody like that who I could hold and kiss under the
mistletoe,&quot; said Seiya.
	Taiki looked up and saw some mistletoe hanging above Seiya. She kissed
Seiya.

	Hotaru and ChibiUsa looked at the Christmas tree as they held each other.
	&quot;Merry Christmas, ChibiUsa,&quot; said Hotaru.
	&quot;Merry Christmas, Hotaru,&quot; replied ChibiUsa.
