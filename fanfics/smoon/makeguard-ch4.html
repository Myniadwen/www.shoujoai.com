Shinozaki stood at the dock watching the old ship rise into the night 
sky. He wondered at why his princess did not wish to replace the heap of 
a vessel. There were much more modern and grand designs she could 
obtain. The ship had withstood countless enemies, from the monsters in 
the abyss of space to time itself. Though, when he thought on it some 
more, he found that the answer should be quite obvious to begin with. 
She was not one for travel, staying within the perimeter of the planet 
and her territory. So the commission of a new ship would not really be 
necessary. Also, there were her own excuses for favoring the old ship 
over any other. She had told him one day, when he had brought the 
subject up, that if it was good enough for her father then it was good 
enough for her as well. She then argued that the ship was in fine shape, 
and that it would last a thousand more years if need be. Why fix 
something that isn&#39;t broken to begin with? The subject was inevitably 
closed that day.

&#39;I suppose it does not matter that the ship is just a bunch of wood and 
sails. It is her power that will take them to the Moon,&#39; he thought. He 
was right. The heart of the ship was really her. The power of Makoto&#39;s 
crystal was what moved the huge ship and protected the crew. When the 
ship left the atmosphere, it would form one of its own under the 
princess&#39;s will. From that point on it would be a smooth, fast voyage to 
the Moon. To the event she dreaded. He really did hope she found some 
enjoyment in the events that awaited her at the Palace of the Moon. He 
knew that if it were himself, he would very much like to spend a month 
there. The palace was a gorgeous place.

&#39;Shingo will absolutely love it I bet.&#39; He found himself smiling. Shingo 
was probably the closest thing Makoto had to family. Shinozaki had found 
him in the East Jovian plains, half starved and barely breathing. Makoto 
herself had nursed him back to health. She also found him a job to do, 
so that he had a place to stay, and insisted on paying him for his 
services. She favored the young boy in her own way. Though she tried to 
remain impersonal with everyone she came in contact with, around Shingo 
he could see small slips here and there. She praised him with a smile on 
occasion, or put him to less menial tasks when she was in the garden. 
She even found a few reasons to raise his earnings. Shinozaki saw how 
protective she was of the boy. Makoto probably did not have a clue as to 
what she was doing when she took him with her. In fact Shinozaki was so 
pleased to hear that the boy was to go with her that he offered to take 
care of the roses in his absence. The princess agreed, but told him of a 
few others she was entrusting with the task as well. Shingo was just as 
surprised that she was taking him with her. Shinozaki couldn&#39;t think of 
a better person to watch her back at the palace. Shingo&#39;s small, 
innocent presence might serve to lighten her mood a bit in the gala that 
awaited her. Though in some subjects Makoto herself might be more 
innocent than even she realized.

He knew his princess was strong and clever, but there were certain 
things he still worried about. She&#39;d had no parental figure for a long 
time. Basically raising herself, she chose the subjects that were 
important for her to learn. That meant anything not dealing with 
swordplay, warfare, or tactics were tossed unceremoniously to the side 
to await the day they might be needed. In his mind, that pile contained 
what many people would consider life itself. There are events that never 
take place on a battle field. Things that are not taught in a practice 
yard, donning armor and weaponry. Things that one cannot feel in the 
heat of battle, but are just as rushed and passionate. These could very 
well be the things that break Makoto or make her even powerful than she 
already is. If she were to embrace what awaits her, she might become 
whole. If she turns it all away, it could be the end of her.

&#39;Please Jove, do not let her innocense be her downfall...or a source of 
embarrassment to her,&#39; Shinozaki laughed lightly to himself. He sounded 
like a big brother, hoping his little sister wasn&#39;t going to be picked 
on during study lessons. He knew he himself was protective of Makoto, 
and he always would be. &quot;Good luck Milady and be sure to come back in 
one piece,&quot; he said to the small speck in the night sky. Turning he 
walked back towards the castle. Passing Nephrite on the way, Shinozaki 
noted the dark look he gave the retreating ship. He knew the princess 
was right about Nephrite, he would have to keep a close watch on the 
other captain. &#39;But for now, I should see to those roses...&#39;

Shingo couldn&#39;t sleep. He shifted uncomfortably on his makeshift cot in 
steerage. The small room was peaceful, with the silence being broken 
only by an occasional turning of the rudder every now and then. Shingo 
watched as the navigator glanced at his compass and then over a chart 
that was laid on the small table before him. The man picked up a quill 
and put a few marks on the map while running a hand over his haggard 
face. Putting the quill down, he sighed. The candle was burning dimly in 
the corner of the room. His relief would be coming soon, and that meant 
he&#39;d finally be able to get some much needed rest. Everyone else seemed 
so tired already to Shingo. He really should be taking advantage of this 
rest period. However, he just couldn&#39;t calm down. He was so excited to 
actually be going to the Palace of the Moon. For someone of his low 
position this was quite a treat. One that others of his class would most 
likely never receive. And he had Makoto to thank for it.

When she told him that he was to accompany her on her journey to the 
Moon, he couldn&#39;t believe his luck. Why did she bring him? Surely there 
were more worthy candidates for such a trip. After getting over the 
initial shock of her announcement he had carried out all of her orders 
in preparation and made sure to give extra special care to the garden 
before they departed. He really hoped that Shinozaki knew what he was 
doing when he offered to take care of the garden. Makoto, thankfully, 
left a few able people to tend to it in case the man was unable to 
accomplish the task.

Rolling over again, Shingo gave up. Throwing the sheets off of his body, 
he left his cot and headed for the door. As he was leaving the navigator 
stopped him and requested that he deliver a message to the princess.

&quot;Tell her that we&#39;ve passed the orbit of Mars. At the rate we&#39;re going 
now, we&#39;ll be arriving on time in about two days.&quot;

Shingo nodded to the man in conformation of his message and left. Most 
of the crew had been ordered to rest by the princess, but there could 
still be one or two on duty elsewhere. Shingo climbed the ladder that 
led to the deck. He lifted the hatch and threw it back, climbing up. The 
chilled air made him shiver slightly as he replaced the hatch quietly. 
Looking around he noticed there was no one else on deck. Well, he knew 
the princess was up here somewhere. She preferred being up top than 
anywhere else in the ship for some reason. Her quarters were unused for 
most of the journey.

Shingo started for the quarter deck pausing only to notice a dark shape 
moving around at the bow of the ship, &#39;Must be the watch,&#39; he guessed, 
moving aft. Ascending the steps he found Makoto sprawled on her back 
with one arm resting over her eyes, the other situated behind her head 
like a pillow. He hesitated at the top step for a moment, debating on 
whether he should bother her or not. His debate ended when she lifted 
the her arm and silently motioned for him to come. When he obeyed the 
gesture she returned her arm to its original place over her eyes. Coming 
close next to her, he sat down cross-legged.

&quot;I have a message from the navigator Milady. He says that we&#39;ve passed 
the orbit of Mars and that we&#39;ll be arriving at the Palace on time. 
That&#39;ll be in about two days.&quot; Shingo pulled a few threads from the 
frayed cuff of his shirt as he spoke.

&quot;Feh...yeah, we don&#39;t wanna be late now, do we?&quot; Makoto mumbled from 
beneath her arm.

Shingo twirled the frayed ends between his fingers. &quot;Will it be a bad 
thing if we are?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Most likely. I don&#39;t think they&#39;d be too happy if I showed up after the 
ball. Think I did it on purpose or something. Understandable I guess. 
Considering I&#39;ve already thought of it,&quot; she smirked.

Shingo flicked a small string across the deck. Regarding Makoto he 
asked, &quot;Milady, why are you lying out here, instead of in your 
quarters?&quot;

Makoto sighed in exasperation, &quot;Keeping watch of course.&quot; She said this 
like it was the most obvious thing in the universe. All the while her 
arm continued to rest over her eyes.

Shingo merely nodded. Then remembering she couldn&#39;t see him he replied 
with a small, &quot;Oh...,&quot; Still a bit confused. &quot;Then wh&#150;&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s good that we&#39;ll be there soon though Shingo. The sooner we get 
there, the sooner we can leave.&quot; Makoto rolled onto her stomach so that 
she was now face down on the deck, cushioning her forehead with her 
arms.

Shingo decided to ignored her aloofness. &quot;What is the Palace like 
Milady?&quot; Shingo had heard a little from Shinozaki about the Palace, but 
not much beyond that. Her answer was a little disappointing.

&quot;Don&#39;t really remember much about it. I know its big, but I was really 
little when we visited it. Everything was big back then.&quot;

&quot;Oh...and the people? What are they like?&quot;

&quot;No idea,&quot; came the muffled reply, &quot;I was kinda shy at the time, so I 
didn&#39;t meet anyone.&quot;

Shingo was a bit surprised by this, &quot;Well, have you ever met the other 
princesses?&quot;

&quot;Nope.&quot;

&quot;Really?&quot; Shingo couldn&#39;t believe it.

&quot;Really...,&quot; she answered. &quot;But don&#39;t worry, we&#39;ll be meeting them at 
the ball. Then have an entire month to become acquainted.&quot; Her voice was 
sarcastic.

&quot;We?!&quot; Shingo squeaked. &quot;I&#39;m to meet them as well?&quot;

Makoto moved her head sideways so that she could see Shingo. &quot;Of course. 
Why wouldn&#39;t you? I mean if you don&#39;t wanna...I see no reason in making 
you. I should be the only one who has to suffer through this month.&quot;

Shingo didn&#39;t know whether to jump for joy or go find a nice place to 
hide until it was all over. Imagine that. Shingo, a servant boy, was 
going to meet the royalty of the Moon Kingdom. He found himself 
wondering how they were going to treat him as he pulled more threads 
from his pant leg. What if he wasn&#39;t liked? Were they going to look down 
on him because he was a servant? He bowed his head. Of course they 
would, they were royalty. Shingo&#39;s thoughts were interrupted as a hand 
rested over his own, stilling his nervous fidgeting.

&quot;Would you stop that already? We can&#39;t have a boy in threadbare clothes 
representing the House of Jupiter.&quot; She removed her hand. &quot;Guess I&#39;ll 
have an extra set of clothes prepared for you along with your formal 
attire when we get to the Palace.&quot;

Shingo rested his hands in his lap. &quot;Thank you Milady.&quot; He sat for a few 
seconds, thinking on her words, then it hit him. &quot;Formal?! What do you 
mean formal attire?!&quot; He practically shouted. He was beginning to panic.

&quot;Now what&#39;s wrong with you? I wasn&#39;t going to mention it until we got 
there, but yes, you&#39;ll be attending the ball with the rest of us Shingo. 
I don&#39;t see why you can&#39;t.&quot;

&quot;B-but, I&#39;ll be the only servant boy there!&quot;

&quot;It&#39;s not going to be that bad, there should be some other boys there 
to...I think. Honestly, no one will even notice anyway.&quot;

What was she saying?! Of course they&#39;d notice. He was going to be the 
only small, Jovian, servant boy at a ball full of warriors and royalty. 
Shingo was about to request of her to forget the formal attire and let 
him stay in his room during the ball. However, he stopped when she put a 
hand on his shoulder. He lifted his head to find her sitting up in front 
of him.

&quot;You have absolutely nothing to worry about Shingo. As long as you stick 
with me no one will bother you, and if they do it&#39;ll be the last anyone 
sees of them anyway.&quot; She took her hand from his shoulder and made a 
fist. &quot;I&#39;ll protect you and the others no matter what. Nobody messes 
with my people.&quot; Her face was a cold mask of calm.

Shingo bowed his head and started to wonder exactly how far she would go 
to protect them. He knew how strong Makoto was, but he didn&#39;t wish any 
hurt on her in his place. At the same time, though, he was very relieved 
to hear her words. They took away any doubt he&#39;d had before, and left 
him feeling safe. It made his heart swell to think that Makoto held him 
as one of her own people, and that he would be treated as and equal. 
Smiling, Shingo thanked his princess and raised his head to tell her 
that he&#39;d be fine. What he saw, however, made him freeze in mid thought. 
Makoto&#39;s piercing gaze was directed at something over his right 
shoulder. Towards the direction in which he had entered the quarter 
deck. She already had a small dagger in one hand and her other seemed to 
be forming a gesture that was directed at him. As his brain quickly 
sorted all of these pieces into place, he finally got his senses 
together enough to follow the motion of her hand. Which was quite 
obviously telling him to move his ass out of the way, and fast.

Shingo obliged by lunging to the left just as Makoto was diving over his 
rapidly moving form. He hit the wooden deck hard and rolled several 
times, knocking into the railing. Scrambling, he made his way to the 
cover of some nearby wooden boxes. As soon as he was behind them, Shingo 
spun to observe the scene that lay before him. Makoto was charging a 
shape that slowly emerged onto the quarter deck. As it came into view 
Shingo ducked further behind the crate in fear, feeling extremely 
defenseless. &quot;Ch&#150;Chimera,&quot; he whispered. His voice cracked as he gripped 
the crate tightly.

The beast roared, barreling violently towards Shingo&#39;s protector as a 
bright flash of light flooded the ship. The thunder roared back....</pre>
