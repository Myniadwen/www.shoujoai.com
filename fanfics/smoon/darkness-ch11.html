<h1>Darkness (part 11 of 25)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/saiyagurl.html">Saiyagurl87</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/darkness-ch10.html">Back to Part 10</a><pre>Laughter and splashes rung throughout the bathroom as the two vampires 
continued to play. Soon the bubble match turned into a wrestling match 
with the girls began flipping each other in the large bath tub.

Soon Serena had Rei pinned underneath her as they both laughed and 
gasped for air. Their eyes soon bore into each other as they stared at 
each other intently. They became lost in each other&#39;s eyes as they 
began to inch their faces together.

They were so close now that they could feel the warmth of their 
breaths against their lips. Rei and Serena stared at each other for a 
moment before their lips collided with each others.

As the kiss grew more fierce Rei wrapped her arms around Serena&#39;s neck 
as Serena wrapped her arms around Rei&#39;s waist. Serena stuck out her 
tongue and brushed it over Rei&#39;s lips silently asking for entrance. 
Rei opened her mouth willingly and moaned slightly as they explored 
each others mouths.

The two broke apart for air and breathed heavily. Serena rested her 
forehead on Rei&#39;s as she closed her eyes. Rei stared up at Serena and 
played with the little hairs at the nape of Serena&#39;s neck. Serena 
opened up her eyes and stared into Rei&#39;s amethyst colored ones.

Serena tilted her head and kissed along Rei&#39;s neck and all over her 
face. Rei closed her eyes loving the feeling of Serena&#39;s warm lips 
against her cool skin. Serena stopped her shower of kisses and lightly 
pecked Rei on the lips.

Rei opened up her eyes half way as Serena put her lips on her left 
ear. Serena whispered something in her ear which made her eyes widened 
in shock which soon welled up with tears. Rei played the words over in 
her mind as some of the tears spilled from her eyes.

&quot;I love you&quot;, whispered Serena again and kissed the tears away from 
Rei&#39;s eyes.

&quot;I love you too.&quot;, whispered Rei hoarsely as she kissed Serena long 
and hard on the lips.

They planted soft kisses on each others necks and lips until Serena 
stood up from her position. She held out a hand for Rei which she 
gladly took. Serena helped her out of the tub and wrapped her in a 
large towel.

Rei did the same for Serena and they walked out of the bathroom hand 
in hand. As they entered the bedroom they went to their dresser draw 
and picked out some clothes. They dressed each other slowly and kissed 
every so often while putting the clothes on.

Serena had dressed Rei in a pair of black sweats and a dark red 
t-shirt as Rei dressed Serena in silver tank top and black shorts. 
Serena laid down on their bed and pulled Rei partially on top of her. 
Rei kissed Serena a couple of times on her lips and soon buried her 
face in her lovers neck.

Serena sighed happily as she held Rei tightly against her. Rei smiled 
against Serena&#39;s neck and lightly nipped and kissed Serena&#39;s neck. 
Serena slightly giggled as Rei flipped them over so Serena was on top. 
Serena laid her head on Rei&#39;s chest and closed her eyes.

Rei wrapped her an arm tightly around Serena as the other stroked 
through Serena&#39;s long silver and blond tresses. Rei rested her chin on 
top of Serena&#39;s head as she to closed her eyes and fell asleep.

*****************

Amara, Michelle, Amy and Setsuna arrived at the old hang out which was 
totally destroyed. There were the dead bodies of the slayers on the 
inside and outside of the building.

There was blood and ashes everywhere as the building was still smoking 
from the fire. Amara growled through gritted teeth as she looked at 
her destroyed home she lived in since she was a child. Michelle 
wrapped her arms around Amara feeling her pain as she too grew up 
here.

&quot;Come on guys, let&#39;s go see if there are any survivors.&quot;, replied 
Setsuna as she held onto Amy&#39;s hand and tugged the girl inside. The 
group looked around in anger and horror as they walked inside of the 
destroyed building.

There was some small fires still going around in the building as smoke 
filled the building. There were furniture broken and thrown across the 
room. Even more dead bodies were inside as were weapons, ashes and 
blood.

The group searched through the building, but couldn&#39;t find anybody. As 
they were about to leave they heard a small whimper and whispering 
coming from under some large pieces of a collapsed ceiling. The group 
rushed over and started pulling off the pieces and found a girl about 
the age eleven and a boy around twelve.

The girl had her leg caught under some cement as the boy tried to keep 
her quiet and get the cement off at the same time. When the boy saw 
the group he stood in front of the girl protectively not wanting any 
more harm done to her.

&quot;Leave us alone slayers!&quot;, yelled the boy. The group stepped back 
slightly before Amara stepped forward.

&quot;We can assure you that we are not slayers, and were her to help 
you.&quot;, said Amara. The boy was not convinced to the least as he glared 
daggers at the group.

&quot;Prove it.&quot;, he growled with venom in his voice. Amara nodded her head 
and let her fangs appear. The boy was finally convinced and moved 
aside to let them help him.

&quot;What&#39;s your name kid?&quot;, asked Amara as she pulled off the large piece 
of cement from the girl&#39;s leg. Amy rushed over to check the leg over 
as Michelle tried to calm the crying girl down. Setsuna stood next to 
Amara listening to the conversation quietly.

&quot;My name is Melvin and that&#39;s my younger sister Molly.&quot;, said Melvin. 
He had chocolate brown hair with matching colored eyes. He had on a 
white t- shirt with some blood seeping through it. He had on black 
baggy jeans which were in the same state as the shirt and a pair of 
sneakers.

Molly has red curly hair the reached her shoulders. She had the same 
brown eyes as her brother and she wore a white button up shirt with a 
black mini skirt. She had on black dress shoes with white socks. She 
too had cuts and scrapes on her body and her leg that was under the 
cement was bleeding pretty badly.

&quot;Where&#39;s your parents?&quot;, asked Setsuna. Melvin looked down at his 
hands as tears filled his eyes.

&quot;They slayers broke into our room and killed our dad. Our mom brought 
us here and told us to hide as she went off to fight. And that&#39;s the 
last time we saw her.&quot;, said Melvin Amara sighed sadly knowing that 
their mother didn&#39;t survive that battle.

&quot;Come on, let&#39;s get you guys fixed up and get you something to eat.&quot;, 
said Amara. Amara went over to Molly and lifted the girl into her 
arms. Michelle grabbed onto Melvin&#39;s hand as did Setsuna to Amy. The 
group exited the building and piled up into the car and drove off back 
to Setsuna&#39;s place.

When the group made it to Setsuna&#39;s they quickly made their way into 
the house. Setsuna carried Molly to the medical wing as Amy and Melvin 
followed closely behind. Amara sighed as she walked into the kitchen 
and took out some blood from the fridge and slowly sipped it.

Amara went to the kitchen table and sat heavily into a chair. Michelle 
came up behind her soul mate and rubbed Amara&#39;s tensed shoulders. 
Amara put her drink down on the table and leaned her head back at the 
feeling of Michelle&#39;s skilled hands rubbing her shoulders.

Michelle bent down and place a kiss on Amara&#39;s lips lightly before she 
walked around the chair and sat in Amara&#39;s lap. Amara sighed again as 
she wrapped her arms around Michelle&#39;s waist and leaned her chin on 
Michelle&#39;s shoulder.

&quot;I can&#39;t believe everything&#146;s gone.&quot;, whispered Amara.

&quot;I know love, but we&#39;ll get our revenge. We will have our day.&quot;, 
replied Michelle as she leaned further back into Amara.

&quot;You know it&#39;s kind of quite. We&#39;re the girls?&quot;, asked Amara. Michelle 
raised her eyebrows in a thoughtful manner.

&quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s go check on them.&quot;, said Michelle as she stood up 
from Amara&#39;s lap. Michelle turned around and pulled Amara out of the 
chair. The two woman walked down the long halls of the large house to 
seek out the four children they had left behind.

They first went to Rini and Hotaru&#39;s room. When they opened up the 
door they found the two curled up in a bean bag chair sleeping. The 
room had Lego&#146;s spilled all over the place and they had their Nintendo 
Game Cube system left on pause with the television on.

Michelle walked over to the television and turned it off along with 
the game. Amara walked into the room and stared at the two girls with 
a little grin. Michelle quickly picked up the Lego&#146;s and put them 
away. Michelle smiled at the girls as she pushed Amara out of the 
door.

&quot;Wow, aren&#39;t they getting close.&quot;, exclaimed Amara as Michelle closed 
the door and turned towards her.

&quot;Amara! You better not go and tease them. It&#39;s bad enough you got Rei 
and Serena.&quot;, warned Michelle as she wagged her finger in front of 
Amara&#39;s face. Amara grabbed the finger and lightly kissed it.

&quot;Now why would I do something like that?&quot;, asked Amara with her best 
innocent look she could muster. Michelle lightly slapped Amara on the 
back of the head and continued down the hall towards the other girls 
room.

Amara slightly pouted and followed after Michelle. Michelle and Amara 
reached the door and lightly knocked. When they didn&#39;t receive an 
reply, Michelle knocked a little harder. When they didn&#39;t receive a 
reply a second time Amara cracked opened the door.

She slowly pushed the door opened all the way. She slowly walked into 
the room with Michelle following closely behind. They spotted the 
girls on the bed and they advanced towards them. Amara grinned as she 
saw the two girls cuddling on the bed.

Michelle smiled at the cute site and looked up at Amara. She frowned 
slightly knowing exactly what Amara was thinking. So, she raised a 
fist and punched Amara lightly on the arm. Amara snapped her head to 
her lover surprised and held a hand to her arm.

&quot;Owwww, what was that for?&quot;, whined Amara. Michelle frowned hardened 
as she stared at Amara.

&quot;Don&#39;t you say anything about this Amara. You leave them alone or your 
going to get it!&quot;, threatened Michelle. Amara took a step back and 
pouted slightly.

&quot;You always take away my fun.&quot;, grumbled Amara under her breath as she 
turned and walked out the door. Michelle put on a satisfied smile as 
she took one more glance at the two girls. She walked out of the room 
and closed the door quietly behind her.</pre>
