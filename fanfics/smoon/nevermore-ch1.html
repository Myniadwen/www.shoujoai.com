<h1>Nevermore (part 1 of 4)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/tensai.html">Tensai no Miko</a><br> </h2>
<pre>     This story contains mild language and mature themes.  Do not read
if you are easily offended.
     In addition, this story contains spoilers for the end of the anime
Sailor Moon.  If you have not seen the end of the series yet, I strongly
recommend that you do so before reading this.  Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;ll wait
for you.  ^_^

     In addition to Naoko Takeuchi, Junichi Sato, and the usual list of
credits for Sailor Moon, I must also thank Edgar Allan Poe, author of
the magnificent poem, &quot;The Raven&quot;.


                      Once Upon a Midnight Dreary

     Crow&#39;s life was wonderful.  Just wonderful.
     Here she was, one of the most powerful warriors the universe had
ever known.  And what was her job?  Playing lackey to a hypercharged
despot who rewarded failure with death.  And what task did that less-
than-benevolent dictator demand?  To search through thousands of
possible targets to find a tiny handful of true star seeds, while the
planet&#39;s best warriors countered them during every single attempt.
     But at least Crow didn&#39;t have to work alone.  Oh, no.  Galaxia
would never be so kind.
     No, Crow was stuck with Sailor Aluminum Siren, an annoying brat of
a tag-along whose toothache-inspiring sweetness was exceeded only by her
complete idiocy.  And to add insult to injury, nobody else even saw
Siren as a stumbling block!  Despite her blatant incompetence, they all
thought that Siren was Crow&#39;s rival!
     Sailor Lead Crow grimaced and reached up to massage her temples.
She had had a headache ever since they came to this miserable planet.
It had gotten only stronger since she and Siren had taken the forefront
in the search.
     The trouble had started several days ago, when Siren was sent to
Earth on her first assignment.  Hours had passed with no word.  Finally
Crow, worried that something had happened to her &quot;partner,&quot; had followed
to check up on her.  There she found Siren, hard at work cleaning Iron
Mouse&#39;s desk.  One would think that such a visible reminder of the
consequences of failure would inspire at least a modicum of focus.
     To anyone but Siren it would, Crow said to herself.
     After a good bit of pestering, Siren finally told Crow--who she
refused to call &quot;Karasuma,&quot; even though they were in civilian guise--
that she would go right out and find the target.  As soon as she
finished lunch.  Then, even when Crow had caved in and found the target
for her, she still couldn&#39;t finish the job properly.
     Crow took a deep breath and let it out in a sigh.  Leaning back in
her chair, she considered mulling some wine to help her relax, then
dismissed it as too much of a bother.
     Since that time, it had always been more of the same, Crow
reflected.  No matter what kind of help Siren did or didn&#39;t get, she
never quite managed to do what was needed.  For her sake, she had better
start coming through on her assignments.
     The thing was, Siren could be really good, maybe even good enough
to be the rival everyone believed her to be, if only she would take her
job seriously.  Instead, she acted like some ditzy schoolgirl who was
too &quot;busy&quot; with other things to make time for studying.  Crow had a lot
of sympathy for the green-haired detective in that Earth show that Siren
liked so much.
     Well, thinking about it wouldn&#39;t help matters.  Crow would be
joining Siren on her mission the next day.  She needed to get some
sleep, or she&#39;d be of no more use than her &quot;rival.&quot;
     At times like this, Crow could almost believe in a God.  It was all
too easy to imagine him looking down upon her, and laughing.
