<h1>Hotaru and Minako: Agents of S.E.N.S.H.I. (part 2 of 2)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/agentsenshi-ch1.html">Back to Part 1</a><pre>&quot;I have to admit,&quot; Hotaru commented as she checked her appearance in the 
mirror and adjusted her black tuxedo, &quot;you look good, partner.&quot;

&quot;Why thank you,&quot; Minako answered, her pale rose dress swirling around 
her. Out of her usual work suit she looked surprisingly beautiful, the 
blonde haired woman wearing just a subtle touch of perfume and makeup. 
Her blue eyes gave Hotaru a admiring look, &quot;You clean up pretty good, 
too.&quot;

Hotaru blushed slightly, her short black hair brushing her shoulders. 
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said, looking away shyly.

Minako had to fight back a smile, thinking of all the surprising things 
that you could discover about people in new circumstances. She and 
Hotaru had worked together for over a year, but it had mostly been 
purely professional, but now she was seeing an entirely different side 
to the reserved young woman. A side, she had to confess, that she was 
finding to be surprisingly attractive.

&quot;Do you think we&#39;ll be able to blend into the wedding party?&quot; Hotaru 
asked curiously, adding the cuff links smoothly.

Minako carefully put on a necklace as she added, &quot;I think we&#39;ll do 
fine.&quot; There was a knock on the door and she called out, &quot;Come in!&quot;

Makoto Kino pushed open the door to the suite, the taller brown haired 
agent wearing another of the rose dresses. She was surprisingly 
beautiful, but that appearance hid a dangerously capable martial artist 
and warrior. &quot;No updates from the Chief yet,&quot; she reported, &quot;but from 
chatter on our operations frequency it sounds like they&#39;ve found our 
missing Finance Minister.&quot;

&quot;How many of our security staff were pulled away to deal with it?&quot; 
Hotaru asked, the window outside showing the incredible views available 
from the Crystal Palace.

&quot;About half,&quot; Makoto grimaced.

Minako swore softly at the horrible timing, adjusting the concealed 
radio she wore. Once she was sure the earpiece was sitting comfortably 
she said, &quot;Discretely go around to our fellow agents and let them know, 
please.&quot;

&quot;Yes ma&#39;am,&quot; Makoto tossed off a military salute then was off.

&quot;Well, we&#39;d better get moving,&quot; Hotaru said seriously. She offered her 
suit clad arm politely and asked, &quot;Shall we?&quot;

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Minako set a gloved hand on hers then they went out into 
the hall.

The Crystal Palace was a fine hotel, now bustling with guests and 
dignitaries and was a security nightmare for them. There were too many 
people, too many rooms to check and almost no way to make sure nothing 
dangerous or illegal got in. The only consolation was a state of the art 
security system, offering cameras and other surveillance over much of 
the building.

Dodging guests and nodding to guards stationed at stairways and 
elevators they made their way to the first floor and the security 
office, now temporarily drafted as their headquarters for the event. 
Natsuna Sakurada was standing in front of the screens, eyes flickering 
as the tall brown haired woman intently studied the goings on around 
them.

Sitting at the control panel Ami Mizuno adjusted a camera slightly, the 
blue haired woman&#39;s eyes focused intently. Their fellow agent handled 
the controls with the same surety she brought to almost anything 
electronic, as well as being a terrific nurse and emergency medic.

Natsuna turned at the sound of a door opening, her eyes narrowing just a 
bit as she saw them enter the room. &quot;Ladies,&quot; she said to them frostily, 
&quot;I can&#39;t say I appreciate my staff being bumped for your associate 
here.&quot;

&quot;Agent Mizuno is extremely qualified,&quot; Minako answered shortly, &quot;as I 
don&#39;t doubt you&#39;ve already checked out.&quot; She scanned the monitors 
herself, checking out the reception hall, dining room and the main hall 
that would be hosting the wedding itself.

&quot;Fair enough,&quot; Natsuna conceded.

Hotaru looked up at the taller woman a bit warily and asked her, &quot;Are 
there any unexpected complications?&quot;

Natsuna snorted as she said, &quot;Well, both sets of parents are fighting, 
the caterers ran out of crackers, at least one brother-in-law is dead 
drunk and I understand the bridesmaid&#39;s outfits were miss-dyed a lovely 
violet.&quot;

&quot;As I said, any unexpected complications?&quot; Hotaru repeated with a small 
smile.

Surprisingly both Minako and Natsuna laughed at that. &quot;No, not really,&quot; 
Natsuna said, &quot;and so far at least, there&#39;s no sign of any terrorists or 
other crazies.&quot;

As Ami flipped through camera images she paused a moment on Makoto, her 
eyes lingering a moment, then she moved on. &quot;As far as we know there&#39;s 
no one unauthorized on the premises, but I can&#39;t say it&#39;ll stay that 
way.&quot;

&quot;The support staff?&quot; Minako assumed.

Ami nodded as Natsuna said, &quot;We&#39;ve screened everyone we hired for this 
event, but that doesn&#39;t mean someone couldn&#39;t be bribed. The best that 
we can do is be vigilant and hope we catch anything unusual.&quot;

Hotaru checked her watch, &quot;Should we check in on the brides?&quot;

&quot;Sounds like a plan,&quot; Minako agreed. They headed out into the hall as 
she looked at Hotaru curiously, &quot;You&#39;re awfully stiff with Natsuna.&quot;

Hotaru shrugged a bit uncomfortably. &quot;I don&#39;t like how she looks at you 
some times,&quot; she finally confessed as they quickly cut across the 
building, &quot;like you still belong with her.&quot;

Minako looked at her in surprise, then smiled slightly. &quot;You don&#39;t have 
to worry,&quot; she reached out to squeeze her hand, &quot;I&#39;m not interested in 
her at all, anymore.&quot; A fond smile touched Minako&#39;s lips, &quot;I fact, 
there&#39;s someone else I like.&quot;

&quot;Who?&quot; Hotaru asked softly.

&quot;I&#39;ll tell you later,&quot; Minako said as they reached the room the three 
women were waiting in. She knocked once then opened the door, &quot;Excuse 
me, we just wanted...&quot;

Both Hotaru and Minako froze in surprise even as Michiru, Setsuna and 
Haruka leapt apart, blushing faintly. &quot;Next time,&quot; Haruka complained 
good naturedly as the sandy haired woman did up her white dress shirt, 
&quot;give us a bit more warning before coming in.&quot;

Hotaru was blushing redly as she scolded them, &quot;Aren&#39;t you supposed to 
save that for after the wedding?&quot;

&quot;Sorry,&quot; Michiru said, her white bridal dress just a bit rumpled, &quot;we 
got bored waiting and it just sort of happened.&quot;

&quot;Would you like us to leave you alone for awhile?&quot; Minako asked with a 
impish look. A bit more seriously, &quot;It&#39;s all clear so far, but we&#39;ll be 
shadowing the event for your safety.&quot;

Setsuna smiled, &quot;Thank you very much, I&#39;ve been very impressed with all 
the work you&#39;ve done in the past few weeks.&quot;

&quot;Just doing our jobs,&quot; Hotaru said a bit gruffly.

Noting her partner&#39;s cute blush Minako said, &quot;We&#39;ll see you at the 
ceremony, then.&quot; She took Hotaru&#39;s hand and tugged, &quot;Excuse us, we 
should get back to it.&quot;

As the door closed they could hear Haruka purr to her future brides, 
&quot;Now, where were we?&quot;

A few hours later the main hall was filled to bursting, rows of chairs 
all occupied by family, friends and notables. The abundance of famous 
faces made Minako even more nervous as she sat in a center aisle seat, 
Hotaru up ahead of her near the altar. &#39;If someone does hit the wedding 
with a bomb it&#39;s going to be a disaster,&#39; she thought.

Haruka looked fairly calm standing up by the altar, apparently the 
earlier quickie had helped calm her nerves. The wedding march began and 
after a moment Michiru and Setsuna were escorted to the altar by their 
fathers, then the nervous female priest began the ceremony.

&quot;Anything?&quot; Hotaru&#39;s voice came over the radios.

&quot;Not yet,&quot; Minako murmured back, feeling her eyes circling the room. 
Over by one wall a group of men and women prepared a buffet for the 
party, drinks of various types being laid out. Flower girls had laid out 
petals on the route, and stiff ushers were waiting along the aisle. She 
switched over to the security office as she saw a very nervous usher 
fidget and asked, &quot;Ami, were the ushers cleared by security?&quot;

&quot;They&#39;re friends of Haruka apparently,&quot; Ami answered, &quot;no, they weren&#39;t 
checked out.&quot;

&quot;Crap,&quot; Minako murmured, easing out of her seat to make her way 
cautiously towards the young man. &quot;Hotaru, possible suspect confirmed,&quot; 
she cued her silently.

Apparently whomever the man was he wasn&#39;t totally stupid, for he saw 
them coming. Reaching into his dress jacket he pulled a gun, turning to 
point it towards the altar even as the ceremony finally began to wind 
down. Then it was suddenly yanked out of his hand by a flash of gold and 
he cried out in alarm.

Gracefully Minako had flicked her wrist out and released the spring 
loaded metal chain she wore disguised as a bracelet, then with a twist 
yanked it back to get the gun from his hand. &quot;No,&quot; he cried out as 
Hotaru tacked him, &quot;I won&#39;t let perverts like you continue to corrupt 
the innocent!&quot; A blow to his head shut him up, swiftly rendering him 
unconscious.

&quot;Carry on, please,&quot; Hotaru waved as they grabbed him and dragged him out 
of the hall, &quot;we&#39;re done, I think.&quot;

They found out the young man&#39;s story, eventually, though it took some 
time. His name was Mamoru, and up until a few years ago he had been 
happily involved with a younger woman named Usagi Tsukino. Sometime 
after she met Rei Hino she had eloped, leaving him deeply heartbroken 
and angry, a rage that eventually fixated on Haruka. He befriended her, 
intending to do some harm to her, then when he heard about the wedding 
he saw his chance.

A little while later Hotaru and Minako stood in the corner, watching the 
couples moving out onto the dance floor together. The chief had given 
them a break, letting their team remain for the party before returning 
to base and writing the endless series of reports.

&quot;Is that Ami and Makoto?&quot; Hotaru blinked, faintly surprised.

&quot;You didn&#39;t know about them?&quot; Minako smiled, sipping her drink. &quot;You 
know,&quot; she added, &quot;I think I like your occasional moments pure 
innocence.&quot;

&quot;I sort of wish I wasn&#39;t so innocent,&quot; Hotaru confessed. She looked at 
Minako curiously, &quot;I thought you&#39;d tell me who you liked?&quot;

Minako ignored the question, &quot;Would you care to dance?&quot;

Hotaru blinked, &quot;I suppose so.&quot; They went out to the dancers hand in 
hand, Minako drawing her close as they swayed together. &quot;You didn&#39;t 
answer my question,&quot; Hotaru murmured, feeling a rush from being so near 
her.

Minako pushed Hotaru&#39;s hair back then bent forward to kiss her, &quot;Oh, I 
think I just did.

End.

Notes: I know &quot;Supreme Enforcement Network and Special Headquarters of 
Investigations&quot; sounds a bit odd, but it was pretty hard to come up with 
something that fit &quot;S.E.N.S.H.I..&quot; I&#39;ve been batting around a 
Mina/Hotaru as agents fic for awhile, but I couldn&#39;t come up with 
something that fit it. Then a theme of &quot;weddings&quot; was suggested at the 
Stars in Love yahoo group and it occurred to me I could fit them 
together pretty well...</pre>
