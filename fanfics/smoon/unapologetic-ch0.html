<h1>Unapologetic (Prologue)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/daughterofmars.html">daughterofmars</a><br> </h2>
<pre>Author&#39;s Notes: This fic was written for the prompt &quot;Understanding, it&#39;s 
misunderstood&quot; at celebrateidaho (LiveJournal) which is a community that 
celebrates the &quot;International Day Against Homophobia&quot; on May 17th. I 
chose to make a little fun of the dubbed version of Sailor Moon and the 
way the translation treated the Haruka/Michiru relationship. Throughout 
the fic you&#39;ll find several references to the dub&#39;s way of concealing 
the fact that Haruka and Michiru are in a lesbian relationship. Besides 
the obvious one (them being cousins), I have also used Michiru&#39;s English 
dub name for one of the OCs and the name of the first boy she kissed 
according to episode 94, Brad, as for one of the OCs. Humourous 
references to how some of the other countries who sent Sailor Moon dealt 
with the Haruka/Michiru relationship by making Haruka a male in her 
civilian form are there as well.

On Michiru&#39;s characterisation: This is my first time writing 
Haruka/Michiru from Michiru&#39;s PoV. I am aware that many people will find 
her OOC, simply because I have taken a different approach to her than 
many of the fics I&#39;ve read. She&#39;s more aggressive and less passive than 
how I&#39;ve seen most people write her. This is due to a comment I read in 
a Sailor Moon yuri discussion that had pretty much become 
Michiru-bashing, due to the fact that many preferred Haruka with all the 
other Senshi. A girl who liked Michiru as a character wrote: &quot;Michiru is 
just as strong as Haruka, just in another way. She&#39;s steel, pretending 
to be silk.&quot; This inspired me a lot, because it&#39;s exactly how I see 
Michiru. Silk-wrapped steel. A perfect match for Haruka. However, if you 
do not agree with my characterisation, that&#39;s fine.

Disclaimer: I do not own Sailor Moon in any way or form. Naoko Takeuchi 
does. I am in no way related to the companies who have broadcastet or 
dubbed Sailor Moon, I&#39;m simply making fun of them. I make no profit from 
this, it&#39;s simply a way to tell the world that homophobia is what&#39;s 
wrong, not homosexuality.

Prologue

- Haruka, &quot;cousin&quot; means &quot;oitokosan&quot;, ne?

A frown; ocean-blue eyes studying the pink letters underneath the 
heading of the pamphlet.

- Hai. Why? Suddenly nervous about your English vocabulary, Michiru?

A crooked smile; short, dirty blonde hair ruffled by a rather feminine 
hand.

- No, demo... I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something I must have misunderstood... 
Look!

The brochure passes between them; fingertips brushing. A short, tense 
absence of reaction.

Then...

- Since when have we been related?

Exchanged looks of confusion with a hint of dawning realisation.</pre>
