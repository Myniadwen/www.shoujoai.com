<h1>Super Sailor Mercury: Shattered Ice (part 18 of 34)</h1>
<h2>a <a href="../smoon/index.html">Sailor Moon</a> 
fanfiction by <a href="../authors/shanejayell.html">Shanejayell</a><br> </h2>
<a href="../smoon/shattice-ch17.html">Back to Part 17</a><pre>Doctor Nicole Mizuno smiled to herself as the car came
to a stop in front of the small house, taking a deep
breath to quell any nervousness. Her dark blue hair
was nearly styled, her clothes casual but stylish, and
a subtle makeup tinted her face. It almost looked like
she was going to a formal event, not a dinner among
friends.

&#39;Of course,&#39; Nicole thought to herself wryly as she
got out of her car, &#39;this isn&#39;t your average dinner
party, either.&#39; After her recent meeting with Setsuna
the other woman had suggested this night out to help
ease her concerns for her daughter, as well as give
the others a chance to get to know her a bit better,
too. &#39;So why am I so nervous?&#39; Nicole wondered as she
picked up the bottle of wine from the passenger seat
then headed to the front door.

Michiru Kaoru answered the door shortly after Nicole
knocked, the green haired younger woman smiling up at
her warmly. &quot;Welcome to our home, Doctor,&quot; she smiled
gently, murmuring thanks as she examined the bottle.

&quot;Thank you,&quot; Nicole slipped her shoes off, following
Michiru inside towards the living room. Haruka Tenoh
looked up from where she sat, a slightly cool smile on
her handsome face. &#39;I can see how Ami could have
mistaken her for a boy,&#39; Nicole thought.

&quot;Nice to see you,&quot; Haruka said, sandy blonde hair
falling into shrewd eyes as she invited Nicole to take
a seat.

&quot;You, too,&quot; Nicole agreed, a bit surprised at the
warmth that both women were showing her. She was still
a relative stranger to them, despite being a parent to
one of their friends. &#39;Of course, making friends is
why I&#39;m here,&#39; she mused.

&quot;Ami and Setsuna took the kids for a walk,&quot; Haruka
said casually, &quot;they were getting a bit restless, I
think.&quot;

&quot;The kids,&quot; Nicole found herself asking, &quot;or Ami and
Setsuna?&quot;

Michiru chuckled to herself softly at that. &quot;A bit of
both, I think,&quot; she said, settling beside Haruka on
the couch. &quot;Luna and Artemis would have been here,
too, but I understand they&#39;re out on a date,&quot; she
explained.

&quot;How can two talking cats have a date?&quot; Nicole blinked
only to get shrugs in reply. She settled down into a
comfortable chair even as she looked at the young
women across from her. Even if Ami hadn&#39;t told her
they were a couple she would have known, Haruka and
Michiru seemed to fit together so comfortably.

&quot;Is there some problem?&quot; Haruka asked Nicole directly,
an arm gently holding Michiru across the shoulders.

Nicole blushed, realizing she had been staring.
&quot;Sorry,&quot; she said sheepishly, &quot;I suppose I&#39;m still
getting used to this whole situation.&quot;

Michiru gently poked Haruka in the side, &quot;Be nice,
love. Nicole is taking things better than most parents
would, I think.&quot;

Haruka smiled wryly vas she conceded, &quot;Sorry, you
certainly have taken it better than our own parents
did.&quot;

Nicole felt a moment of surprise, looking at the two
clearly content young women. &quot;You&#39;re parents didn&#39;t
take it well that you&#39;re lesbians?&quot; she asked
tentatively.

Michiru sighed softly as she admitted, &quot;My father took
it badly, though I think my mother is still trying to
bring him around.&quot;

&quot;My dad took it pretty well,&quot; Haruka smiled impishly
at the memory, &quot;though I think my parents already
guessed. Mom, on the other hand..&quot;

&quot;A tomboy growing up?&quot; Nicole guessed and Haruka
grinned.

&quot;I&#39;ve seen photos,&quot; Michiru said to her cheerfully, &quot;I
don&#39;t think Haruka wore a dress unless it was by
force.&quot;

The sound of the front door opening was quickly
followed by a young girl rushing inside, gently
tugging a taller black haired girl. &quot;We had some
chocolate and...&quot; Chibi-Usa started then the pink
haired girl trailed off on seeing Nicole there.
&quot;Hello, Mrs. Mizuno.&quot;

&quot;Good evening Mizuno-sensei,&quot; Hotaru said to her
shyly, the young lady&#39;s long black hair hiding part of
her face.

&quot;Mother,&quot; Ami Mizuno smiled warmly, her blue hair
gently ruffled by the wind, &quot;I see you got here a bit
early.&quot; The scar that cut across the bridge of her
nose still startled Nicole even though she had months
to get used to it, that and her daughters more somber
attitude. Still, she seemed happier now, especially
because of her...

Nicole felt mixed emotions as she saw Setsuna enter,
this older woman who stood so protectively close to
Ami&#39;s side. On one hand she was glad that Ami had
found this caring older woman, but on the other hand
she did wonder if Ami might be a bit too young for all
this. &#39;Then again,&#39; she admitted, &#39;I though she was
young for taking care of Chibi-Usa, and I was wrong
about that.&#39;

&quot;Welcome to our home,&quot; Setsuna bowed gracefully, the
simple dress she wore hugging her slim body, her long
mane of greenish black hair flowing like a ebony wave.

&quot;Sorry for being early,&quot; Nicole said with a smile, &quot;I
got a bit impatient.&quot;

&quot;The last time you were introduced it was a bit of a
mob scene,&quot; Setsuna continued smoothly, &quot;I&#39;d like you
to meet Hotaru, our adopted daughter, more or less.&quot;

Hotaru Tomoe smiled slightly as she bowed. &quot;It&#39;s very
nice to meet you,&quot; she said a bit nervously, &quot;Ami has
told us so much about you.&quot;

Nicole had to fight back a chuckle, knowing that
Hotaru had just politely fibbed. Knowing Ami she
hadn&#39;t said much about her mother, if anything at all.
&quot;To be honest I&#39;m honored you all invited me,&quot; she
answered.

Michiru smoothly rose, &quot;Haruka, could you help me with
dinner?&quot; She smiled, &quot;Hotaru, didn&#39;t you have a new
lamp you wanted to show Chibi-Usa?&quot;

Nicole blinked, just a bit surprised at how deftly
Michiru had just arranged it for the three of them to
be alone. &#39;Remind me not to underestimate that girl,&#39;
she thought.

&quot;Thanks for coming,&quot; Ami flashed a smile, a certain
gentleness in her eyes.

&quot;I&#39;m glad to have been invited,&quot; Nicole felt herself
smiling slightly, &quot;especially after the grilling I
gave Setsuna the last time I saw her.&quot;

&quot;Eh?&quot; Ami blinked.

Nicole raised a eyebrow at Setsuna, &quot;You didn&#39;t tell
her?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; Setsuna blushed a bit. She looked over at Ami
shyly, &quot;Nicole stopped by the nurse&#39;s office to have a
chat about you,&quot;

&quot;Mother!&quot; Ami blurted.

&quot;Nothing too bad,&quot; Nicole quickly reassured her
daughter, &quot;I just wanted to find out Setsuna&#39;s
intentions towards you.&quot;

&quot;Oh god,&quot; Ami blushed.

Setsuna&#39;s cheeks were also faintly red as she looked
over at Nicole, &quot;I can&#39;t believe you just told her
that.&quot;

&quot;With my daughter I&#39;ve always felt honestly was the
best policy,&quot; Nicole smiled suddenly, &quot;especially
since the birds and the bees incident.&quot;

&quot;Oh?&quot; Setsuna had to ask.

Nicole smiled fondly in memory, &quot;When Ami was seven
she asked me where babies came from, and I tried to
put her off. Instead she got into my medical texts and
found out herself.&quot;

&quot;Mom,&quot; Ami wailed.

Setsuna patted Ami&#39;s hand comfortingly, &quot;I could see
you doing that, too.&quot;

&quot;My friends used to tell me how much fun it was to
embarrass their kids in front of suitors,&quot; Nicole
chuckled, &quot;they were right.&quot; Her eyes lit up with glee
as she added, &quot;Oh, I wish I brought the embarrassing
baby photos!&quot;

&quot;You could always bring them next time?&quot; Setsuna
grinned.

&quot;I&#39;m going to die,&quot; Ami moaned as she covered her face
with her hands to try to hide her now nearly beet red
blush.</pre>
