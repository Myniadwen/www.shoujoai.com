<p>Budding Romances</p>
<p>Venus moaned from deep in her throat,  the sunlight finally arousing her. Pluto turned to look at her,  asking quietly, “Are you awake?”</p>
<p>At the sound of her voice, Venus' head  snapped up, which then made her realize exactly where she was. With  a nervous smile, she nodded and answered, “Uh, yeah, I'm fine,  sorry. You can put me down now.”</p>
<p>Pluto, ever the vigilant multi-tasker,  had carried Venus on her back while searching for something edible, a  good place to rest, and any signs of living creatures. Though she  had hardly felt the fatigue- courtesy of extensive work outs outside  of regular Senshi training- Pluto carefully bent down so that Venus  could disembark. The sudden weight on her feet made Venus wobble for  a few moments, but she soon gathered her bearings and they started  walking side by side.</p>
<p>The silence was actually rather  peaceful, a tranquility that Pluto was accustomed to, in her regular  trips through the flow of time, and that Venus rarely calmed down to  enjoy. Today, especially after being separated from her love, was  not one of those rare days.</p>
<p>It began with the humming of a popular  love song. Knowing that Venus had a rather above average knack for  singing, Pluto did not mind this in the least.</p>
<p>The humming formed a few low syllables  and disconnected words. Pluto made a silent game of trying to guess  the words that Venus was uttering. While in the matters of history  and concepts she was unparalleled, songs of the commonfolk were  rarely given much attention by the Senshi of Time.</p>
<p>The disconnected words slowly joined  to make a fair modicum of sense. Though Pluto sincerely questioned  the point of writing such a song, she would have had no trouble  admitting to liking the lyrics, as well as the melody.</p>
<p>Without seeming to have realized it,  Venus began to sing wholeheartedly, save for the faraway look in her  eyes. And then it clicked. The notion that she was calling to her  love as a lovesick Siren might registered in Pluto's mind. She then  connected it to the talk they had had with Rei... Rei.</p>
<p>“M-minako-san?”</p>
<p>Venus blinked, as if the interruption  had stolen her away from frolicking in a completely different world.   “Hnh?”</p>
<p>Pluto winced slightly, but asked, “I  apologize if this may sound like a sudden or inappropriate inquiry,  but have you ever fallen in love on a level of those that commonly  find themselves in love with you?”</p>
<p>Again, Venus blinked, trying to digest  her words. Finally, she verified, “You mean, have I ever  worshiped someone? Other than a literal god?” At Pluto's  silent nod, Venus' hands came together behind her head as she looked  to the sky for answers. “Well, no, actually. Not worship at  least. I <em>am</em> in love right  now though.”</p>
<p>“How can you  be sure of that, if you have nothing to base it on?”</p>
<p>“With that  kind of logic, how would you identify that first time?”</p>
<p>“I see. In  that case, what is your definition of love?”</p>
<p>Venus blinked,  halfway to asking the fellow Senshi 'Why' but refrained from doing so  in the nick of time. Instead, she shrugged. “Romantic love,  I'm guessing, right? Well... to me, Love is the feeling you have for  the person that can make you feel warm and cozy inside, no matter  what the circumstances are on the outside. Love is the feeling that  makes you want to always stay by that side, regardless of the  consequences. Love is... a feeling no human should die without  knowing at least once.”</p>
<p>Pluto was silent  for a long period, before she gave a slight nod. When no further  questions seemed evident, Venus asked, “Why are you asking?”</p>
<p>As if the question  would answer it, Pluto murmured, “Do you honestly believe that  you love Rei-san? More than anyone else?”</p>
<p>It was then, that  that familiar summer breeze ruffled Venus' hair, and she recognized  it. With a soft smile she replied, “I do. But she's also my  best friend- has been since the day we met when we were toddlers.   Because of that, so long as she still loves me, I'll do my best to  make sure my decisions don't hurt her with unnecessary reason.”</p>
<p>Again, Pluto  remained silent, recognizing the reason behind Venus' wording.   Rather then attempt to plow ahead with the conversation, she found a  quick change of subject. “The fruit growing upon that tree  appear to be ripe and edible. Shall we pick a few to last us until  we come upon another?”</p>
<p>Venus smiled at  that. “Yeah, I'm starving! Some good ol' fresh fruit will do  wonders for my skin! Too many days on a ship- pirate or not- and you  really miss the sweet things of the food chain. Now how... I know!   Venus... Love Me Chain!”</p>
<p>As the whip of  light lashed out and snapped off several fruits, Pluto couldn't help  but think, <em>And here I thought I already did (love you). I suppose  I don't need a whip to convince me of that.</em></p>
<p align="center">&amp; ((“”)) --- Natural Plants and Pond Water  ---</p>
<p>“Ugh... that was a big  explosion. Ah- Ami-chan? You okay?”</p>
<p>Mercury smiled wanly as she clutched  her own pulsing temple. “I'm as all right as can be expected.   What about you? You were close to the source, weren't you?</p>
<p>Jupiter briefly flexed her hands  before shaking her head, in effect, losing the migraine in one  painful moment. After it passed, she smiled and replied, “I'm  fine. I've always been a little hard headed, so nothing was damaged  really. Hmm...” Jupiter paused to look around before she  murmured, “Any idea where we are?”</p>
<p>In an instant, Mercury had her  computer analyst out and working, thus quickly coming to an accurate  answer. “We're about twenty-five kilometers from the port city  of Kyoma, but this is a deserted island, according to the government  records, it's... too small...”</p>
<p>As she trailed off, Jupiter looked up  and rose a questioning eyebrow. “Something else wrong?”</p>
<p>Mercury hastily shook her head, but  answered, “This island has a radius of approximately five point  two kilometers- a small town could fit on this... though you would  have to clear away the forest... and-”</p>
<p>“Aww leave it alone. Free  plants never hurt anybody did they? Well, excluding the demonic  ones- they don't count.”</p>
<p>Mercury made a small smile at that.   “I'm sensing the others are all safely on this island. Should  we go look for them? From here... Michiru-san and Haruka-san seem to  be closest.”</p>
<p>Jupiter nodded as she stood up,  offering a helping hand to Mercury. After thanking her and getting  to her feet, Mercury pointed in the direction her computer picked up  the strong energy signals of their current targets.</p>
<p>As is commonly the case, the silence  started to get to them, after a while. With a low sigh, Jupiter  started, “Umm... so... why'd you come with the Princess out  here?”</p>
<p>If Jupiter hadn't been watching, she  might have missed the light tint of pink that raced across Mercury's  face just then. After assuring herself that her stutter was a thing  of the past, Mercury responded, “I... My computer made it  easier to lock onto everyone and find you.”</p>
<p>“Eh...” Jupiter made a  small murmur of appreciation, deciding to avert her gaze to the trees  that were quickly surrounding them.</p>
<p>The silence lengthened further, before  Jupiter managed to ask, “So... what's been going on around the  Kingdom since I've been gone? It's been a while...”</p>
<p>“Well, we... the marketplace  opened a new chain near the castle, a few years ago. The business is  very good now.”</p>
<p>“Really? Do they sell any  jewels? Emeralds? Jades?”</p>
<p>“Um... on occasion... when new  shipments come in...”</p>
<p>Jupiter's hum trailed off into  silence, as Mercury tried to find another topic. “Do you  remember Mamoru-san? From England (England, Earth, same  difference...)?” At Jupiter's nod, Mercury continued, “He  and the Princess are engaged to be married next June.”</p>
<p>“Are they... willing?”</p>
<p>“Oh, very much so! It's... it's  really sweet, seeing them together. They're both born diplomats, so  there isn't much personal contact in public, but... mm... you can  tell they love each other.”</p>
<p>Jupiter watched from the corner of her  eye as a sappy grin appeared on Mercury's face, afore she abruptly  shook out of it, and blushed out of embarrassment. Then, in a very  measured tone, Mercury murmured, “It's something all the Senshi  should be able to see for themselves.”</p>
<p>As both knew what she really wanted to  say, the silence only lengthened again before Jupiter could reply.   “I... It's fun being a pirate. Sailing the seas... fighting to  my heart's content... heh, losing the court etiquette... but... I can  also feel my heart tugging me back towards the Kingdom. To the  Princess... To my fellow Senshi... but... I don't know... I'm not  sure what I want to do anymore.”</p>
<p>After a pause, Mercury murmured, “I'm  sure you'll know what I'd suggest, so...”</p>
<p>“No,” Jupiter shook her  head, “Please, tell me.”</p>
<p>Mercury sighed. “You belong  within range of the Princess, with her Private Guard.”</p>
<p>“Do I really? I'm the avatar of  the largest planet in our range. The Senshi of Lightning... of Zeus.   Is it really right for me to be paired with you, all the Inner  Senshi?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying you're too good  for us...?”</p>
<p>“NO! No... I mean... I don't  know... the opposite I think. No offense to the Outer Senshi, but...  I feel like I should be distance from the Princess... like they are.”</p>
<p>“But... They <em>aren't</em> distant... except Haruka-san.”</p>
<p>“Wha..?”</p>
<p>“Pluto is  Queen Serenity's head advisor. Neptune and Saturn protect the Crown  at all times, no matter if it's the Princess, the Queen, or even  Prince Endymion. Actually, come to think of it, the Outer Senshi  might be closer to the Crown than the Inner Senshi...”</p>
<p>“What!   That's impossible! Mina-chan, Rei-chan, you, too, you all protect  the Princess right? How can the Outer Senshi be closer?”</p>
<p>At that, Mercury  turned and gave Jupiter a wry smirk that was unusual on the Senshi of  Wisdom's face.</p>
<p>“You were  the first to leave. Half a week ago, Mina-chan and Rei-chan both  went out to sea. Who was left? For the Outer Senshi, Setsuna-san,  Hotaru-chan, and Michiru-san. For the Inner Senshi... it was just  me. They're closer, because more of them are there, at the heart of  where our protection actually counts.</p>
<p>“Come back  with us Mako-chan. We need you... the Princess needs you... <em>I</em> need you...”</p>
<p align="center">O-   &amp; -- (Male/Female &amp; Neptune)</p>
<p>“They're  this way.”</p>
<p>“And  I'm telling you it's <em>this</em> way! My gut instinct is always  right!”</p>
<p>“My <em>mirror</em> never lies.”</p>
<p>“Oh,  come on! There's a hill if we go in my direction- we can look at  them from there.”</p>
<p>“And  run into an assortment of wild creatures, many of which could very  well indeed be poisonous on the way? I think not.”</p>
<p>“Hey,  this is an island- we're no safer here than there. Let's go this  way!”</p>
<p>“And  I'm telling you, the Princess is <em>this</em> way. Can you not sense  her energy?”</p>
<p>“Of  c-... Of course I can! J- But the other Senshi are here too! What,  you want to just abandon them here for the Princess?”</p>
<p>“And  you would rather abandon the Princess? Where is your sense of  loyalty?”</p>
<p>“I-  Oh stop taking words out of my mouth. I didn't say that. Just, tch,  maybe it'd be better if we went our separate ways, and see who finds  them all first.”</p>
<p>“All  of them? You think this was some sort of planned scavenger hunt?”</p>
<p>“Sca-  there you go again! Geez, can't I just <em>say</em> something without  you interpreting it any differently then how it's supposed to be!”</p>
<p>“Oh?   And exactly how do you expect me to interpret it?”</p>
<p>“Exactly  like I say it!”</p>
<p>“Come,  I sense that Mars is also near the Princess. Will that satisfy your  quest in seeking out the other Senshi first?”</p>
<p>“Que-  I didn't mean it like that! We-”</p>
<p>“-are  only two individuals. There are six other Senshi here, if you also  include the Princess. Rest assured, we <em>will</em> all depart  together.”</p>
<p>Uranus  was silent for a long time... until she finally gave in, throwing her  hands up in an exasperated gesture, and muttered, “Fine. Let's  go see if your way leads to the Princess. But if we hit the beach  first, I get to choose which way we go.”</p>
<p>“The  ocean is a fine place to start, considering that we are all  surrounded by it.”</p>
<p>“Whatever.   Just- this way you said?”</p>
<p>As  Uranus took a few steps forward, Neptune stopped her to correct her  direction... a few steps to the left. Once corrected, Uranus plowed  through the thick grass, unconsciously setting a neat path for  Neptune to walk on. With a soft smile, Neptune followed Uranus,  knowing that she would be proven right, and even if she wasn't, it  wouldn't be too terrible to let Uranus lead anyway.</p>
<p align="center">!$!$  (Uh... the crew... bleeps included)</p>
<p>“Where  da heck are we! And where's Cap'n Tenoh? Kino? Heck, right 'bout  now, Ise wouldn't even care if it was jus' that Mars chick. Just  someone ta point the way!”</p>
<p>“Uh... Ken? I think  we're pretty much stranded here... didnt'cha see both the ships get  blown to smithereens?”</p>
<p>“See it? <em>See </em>it!   Boy, Ise was walkin' right past the room that had ta explosives!   Idiot! Of course I know the ships are gone! Ahh... me blissful  Zephyr... may Hell smite da cretin that had ya destroyed!”</p>
<p>“Uh...  you all right there? Erm... you know, I think it was uh, Mina-chan  that started the explosives...”</p>
<p>“Dang  blondes and their blond moments. Neva shoulda allowed 'er on board.”</p>
